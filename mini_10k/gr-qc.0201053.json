Although they have been studied for years,1 they still attract\nquite a lot of attention in the physics and astrophysics literature and, in fact, an\nexponential growth of the number of related papers can be observed.2 It turns\nout that several field theories are known to possess solutions which exhibit black\nhole properties:\n\u2022 The \"standard\" gravitational ones which, according to our current postulates, are black holes for all classical fields.\n\u2022 The \"dumb holes\", which are the sonic counterparts of black holes, first\ndiscussed by Unruh [127].\n\u22c6\n1\n\n2\n\nPartially supported by a Polish Research Council grant # KBN 2 P03B 130 16.\nThe reader is referred to the introduction to [27] for an excellent concise review of\nthe history of the concept of a black hole, and to [26, 82] for more detailed ones.\nA search on the key word \"black holes\" on 2.XI.2001 reveals 213 papers on gr-qc for\nthe current year and 773 papers from 1991, date of the beginning of the archive; the\nfigures on astro-ph and hep-th are very similar.\n\n\f2\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\n\u2022 The \"optical\" ones \u2013 the black-hole counterparts arising in the theory of\nmoving dielectric media, or in non-linear electrodynamics [95, 111].\n\u2022 The \"numerical black holes\" \u2013 objects constructed by numerical general relativists. We shall argue below that this leads to the need of introducing, and\nstudying, new frameworks for the notion of black holes; two such frameworks\n(\"naive black holes\" and \"quasi-local black holes\") will be introduced and\nstudied in Sections 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 below.\n(An even longer list of models and submodels can be found in [9].) In this\nwork we shall discuss various aspects of the above. The reader is referred to\n[21, 51, 77, 83, 113, 133] and references therein for a review of quantum aspects of\nblack holes. Let us start with a short review of the observational status of black\nholes in astrophysics.\n\n1.2\n\nExperimental evidence\n\nWhile there is growing evidence that black holes do indeed exist in astrophysical\nobjects, and that alternative explanations for the observations discussed below\nseem less convincing, it should be borne in mind that no undisputed evidence\nof occurrence of black holes has been presented so far. The flagship black hole\ncandidate used to be Cygnus X-1, known and studied for years (cf., e.g., [27]).\nIts published mass has been going up and down over time: an optimistic interpretation of this phenomenon is that there has been mass accretion during the\nascending periods, and Hawking radiation during the descending ones; a more\nrealistic one is that there is still considerable uncertainty in the determination\nof this mass. Table 1.13 lists a series of very strong black hole candidates in\nX-ray binary systems; Mc is mass of the compact object and M\u2217 is that of its\noptical companion; some other candidates, as well as references, can be found\nin [103, 109]. The binaries have been divided into two families: the High Mass\nX-ray Binaries (HMXB), where the companion star is of (relatively) high mass,\nand the Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), where the companion is typically\nbelow a solar mass. The LMXB's include the \"X-ray transients\", so-called because of flaring-up behaviour. This particularity allows to make detailed studies\nof their optical properties during the quiescent periods, which would be impossible during the periods of intense X-ray activity. The stellar systems listed have\nX-ray spectra which are neither periodic (that would correspond to a rotating\nneutron star), nor recurrent (which is interpreted as thermonuclear explosions\non a neutron star's hard surface). The final selection criterion is that of the mass\nMc exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit MC \u2248 3 solar masses M\u2299 .4 According to\nthe authors of [27], the strongest black hole candidate in 1999 was V404 Cygni,\nwhich belongs to the LMXB class.\nTable 1.1 should be put into perspective by realizing that, by some estimates [99], a typical galaxy \u2013 such as ours \u2013 should harbour 107 \u2212 108 stellar\n3\n\n4\n\nThe recent review [109] lists thirteen black hole candidates.\nSee [103] for a discussion and references concerning the value of MC .\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n3\n\nTable 1.1.

We note an interesting proposal, put forward in [28], to carry\nout observations by gravitational microlensing of some 20 000 stellar mass black\nholes that are predicted [105] to cluster within 0.7 pc of Sgr A\u2217 (the centre of\nour galaxy).\nIt is now widely accepted that quasars and active galactic nuclei are powered by accretion onto massive black holes [101, 135]. Further, over the last few\nyears there has been increasing evidence that massive dark objects may reside\nat the centres of most, if not all, galaxies [100, 120]. In several cases the best\nexplanation for the nature of those objects is that they are \"heavyweight\" black\nholes, with masses ranging from 106 to 1010 solar masses. Table 1.25 lists some\nsupermassive black hole candidates; some other candidates, as well as precise\nreferences, can be found in [87, 103, 104, 119]. The main criterion for finding candidates for such black holes is the presence of a large mass within a small region;\nthis is determined by maser line spectroscopy, gas spectroscopy, or by measuring\nthe motion of stars orbiting around the galactic nucleus. The reader is referred\nto [108] for a discussion of the maser emission lines and their analysis for the\nsupermassive black hole candidate NGC 4258. An example of measurements via\ngas spectrography is given by the analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations of the radio galaxy M 87 [126] (compare [101]): A spectral analysis\nshows the presence of a disk-like structure of ionized gas in the innermost few\narc seconds in the vicinity of the nucleus of M 87. The velocity of the gas measured by spectroscopy (cf. Fig. 1.1) at a distance from the nucleus of the order of\n6 \u00d7 1017 m, shows that the gas recedes from us on one side, and approaches us on\n5\n\nThe table lists those galaxies which are listed both in [104] and [87]; we note that\nsome candidates from earlier lists [119] do not occur any more in [87, 104].

To close the discussion of\nTable 1.2, we note that the determination of mass of the galactic nuclei via direct\nmeasurements of star motions has been made possible by the unprecedentedly\nhigh angular resolution and sensitivity of the HST. There seems to be consensus\n[87, 104, 120] that the two most convincing supermassive black hole candidates\nare the galactic nuclei of NGC 4258 and of our own Milky Way.\nThere is a huge gap between the masses of stellar mass black holes and\nthose of the supermassive black holes and, in Bromley's terminology [20], \"middleweight\" candidates would be welcome. Such a tentative black hole with M of\nthe order of 460M\u2299 has been identified in M 82 by A. Ptak and R. Griffiths [117].\nE. Colbert and R. Mushotzky [48] give a list of compact X-ray sources which\ncould include some further black holes with masses in the 102 \u2212 104 M\u2299 range.\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n5\n\nLet us close this section by pointing out the review paper [25] which discusses\nboth theoretical and experimental issues concerning primordial black holes.\n\n1.3\n\nCausality for symmetric hyperbolic systems\n\nThe usual, Scri based, definition of a black hole proceeds as follows: one starts\nby introducing a preferred asymptotic region \u2013 this is usually taken to be a\nconformal boundary. Then the black hole region is defined as the set of points\nwhich cannot send information to the asymptotic region; we will return to the\ndetails of this construction in Section 1.4 below. The key ingredient here is\nthe notion of \"not being able to send information\" \u2013 this is usually defined\nusing the metric, together with the postulate that the propagation speed for\nobjects carrying information is bounded from above by that of null geodesics.\nThe aim of this section is to provide a precise mathematical version of this notion,\nvia Proposition 1 below, for any symmetric hyperbolic system of differential\nequations, without introducing any supplementary postulates. The point is that\nevery physical theory defines its own causality via the corresponding system of\nequations. We will then show in Section 1.3.1 how the \"Unruh metric\" arises in\nthe application of our construction to the Euler equations.\nLet, thus, L be a quasi-linear, symmetric hyperbolic, first order partial differential operator acting on sections \u03c6 of a bundle E, with scalar product h*, *i,\n\nFig. 1.1.

Given a section \u03c6 of E (defined perhaps on a subset of M ), a hypersurface\nS is said to be spacelike6 if one of its fields of co-normals n\u03bc satisfies\nA\u03bc (\u03c6 (p) , p) n\u03bc (p) > 0 ,\n\np\u2208S ;\n\nthis is understood in the sense of strict positive definiteness of endomorphisms.\nBy definition of a symmetric hyperbolic system, every point of the domain of\ndefinition of \u03c6 lies on some spacelike hypersurface.

The bundles T \u266f \u2282 T M , respectively C \u266f \u2282 T M , of timelike,\nrespectively causal, vectors are defined by duality:\nTp\u266f := {X \u2208 Tp M |\u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 Tp\u266d X \u03bc \u03b1\u03bc > 0} ,\n\nCp\u266f := Tp\u266f = {X \u2208 Tp M |\u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 Tp\u266d X \u03bc \u03b1\u03bc \u2265 0} .\n\n(1.4a)\n(1.4b)\n\nRecall that all standard classical field equations, i.e., Euler's equations, the scalar\nwave equation, the wave map equation, Maxwell's equations, Yang-Mills equations, or Einstein's equations, can be written as a symmetric hyperbolic system\n(cf., e.g., [118] or [125, Vol. IV]). For example, the wave equation for a scalar\nfield u on a Lorentzian manifold (M , g) can be written in the form (1.1) by\nintroducing a new set of variables\n\u03c6 := (u, e\u03bc (u)) ,\nwhere the e\u03bc 's, \u03bc = 0, . . . , n, form an ON-frame for g. In this case T \u266f coincides\nwith the bundle of timelike future pointing vectors of the metric g (where the\nfuture direction is determined by that of e0 ), C \u266f coincides with the bundle of\ncausal future pointing or vanishing vectors of g, while T \u266d and C \u266d are, modulo\nsign (we are using the signature (\u2212, +, . . . , +)), \"T \u266f and C \u266f with indices lowered\nusing the metric\". The same remains true for wave maps, for linear electrodynamics (considered as a first order system for E and B), for the Yang-Mills\nequations in the Lorentz gauge, and for the usual symmetric hyperbolic reduction of Einstein's equations based on harmonic coordinates. (See the end of this\nsection for more comments about the Einstein case.)\nWe emphasize that the bundles T \u266f , etc., are defined solely by the system of\nequations under consideration, independently of any metric. They can be used\nto determine the causality properties of a given symmetric hyperbolic system\nby mimicking the usual metric constructions [13, 73, 112, 115]: timelike future directed paths are defined as piecewise differentiable maps \u03b3 from I to M , where\nI \u2282 R is an interval, with the property that the tangent \u03b3\u0307 is in T \u266f wherever\ndefined; causal future directed paths are defined as Lipschitz continuous paths\nsuch that \u03b3\u0307 is in C \u266f wherever defined. Past directed paths are paths which are obtained from future directed paths by a reversal of parameterization. The timelike\nfuture I + (\u03a9), respectively the causal future J + (\u03a9), of a set \u03a9 \u2282 M is defined\nas the set of points which can be reached form \u03a9 by following a future directed\ntimelike, respectively causal, path. Causal and timelike futures J \u2212 and I \u2212 are\nobtained form the above definition by replacing \"future\" by \"past\". Notions such\nas global hyperbolicity, and so on, can be defined in the usual way. It might be\nconvenient to write I \u00b1 (\u03a9, L), etc., to emphasize the dependence upon the system of equations L, if ambiguities can arise. We note that for semi-linear systems\n\u2013 by definition, these are the systems in which the coefficients A\u03bc in (1.1) do not\ndepend upon \u03c6 \u2013 the resulting causal constructs are independent of the solution\n\u03c6 under consideration; however, this will not be the case in general.\nWe are ready now to address the issue of main interest in this work \u2013 the\nnotion of a black hole. Given a set \u03a9 \u2282 M and a symmetric hyperbolic system\n\n\f8\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nL we define the black hole region B\u03a9 (L) of \u03a9 as\nB\u03a9 (L) := M \\ J \u2212 (\u03a9, L) .\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe object so defined depends upon the set \u03a9, and acquires its full meaning\nwhen \u03a9 is naturally distinguished by the problem at hand.\nIn several cases, some of which have already been mentioned, the causality\ntheory constructed above arises out of a metric; we will show in Section 1.3.1\nbelow that this holds also for the Euler equations. The intuitive meaning associated to the notion of a black hole region is that no information from B\u03a9 (L)\ncan reach \u03a9. This is made precise by the following result, the proof of which\nproceeds by causality arguments which are known in principle:\nProposition 1 Let \u03c6 be a solution of\nL[\u03c6] = J ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere L is symmetric hyperbolic operator (1.1) on a manifold M , and suppose\nthat there exists a Lorentzian metric g such that the sets C \u266f defined in (1.4b) are\nfuture light cones of g. Assume that (M , g) is globally hyperbolic with Cauchy\nsurface S and consider a set \u03a9 \u2282 M such that B\u03a9 (L) 6= \u2205. If \u03c6\u2032 is a solution\nof\nL[\u03c6\u2032 ] = J \u2032 with \u03c6|S = \u03c6\u2032 |S ,\n(1.7)\nand if the difference of the source terms J \u2212 J \u2032 is supported in B\u03a9 (L), then\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 on J \u2212 (\u03a9, L).\n\nWe believe that the conclusion above is true without the assumption that\ncausality is determined by a metric, but we are not aware of any studies of this\nquestion in the current context; it would be of interest to settle this. The reader\nis referred to [97] for an analogous analysis of strictly hyperbolic systems, and\nto [30] for that of second order Lagrangean hyperbolic systems.\nWe close this section by mentioning that care has to be taken when interpreting the notions above for systems of equations which are not directly in first\norder symmetric hyperbolic form: it can happen that the physical equations can\nbe then rewritten in several different symmetric hyperbolic forms, leading to different notions of pasts, futures, black hole regions, etc. This does indeed happen\nfor the Einstein equations: in [57, Section 4.1] a symmetric hyperbolic system is\npresented which can be used to solve the Einstein equations and in which the\ncausal cones, as defined above, differ from the metric ones; see the discussion\nafter Equation (4.25) there. Another example of this kind arises if the T -vector\nof the system of equations given in Sect. 5.2 of [55] is chosen to be spacelike.\nThis is related to the acausal (in the usual metric sense) propagation of gauge\ndegrees of freedom in the associated systems, and does of course not affect the\npropagation of any physically relevant quantities. Given a system of equations,\nsay (S), a simple way out of this problem is to define the physical black hole\nregion as the intersection, as L runs over the set of those symmetric hyperbolic\nsystems L the solutions of which include solutions of (S), of the associated black\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n9\n\nhole regions B\u03a9 (L). We note that the existence of exact solutions such as the\npp-waves, where nonlinear perturbations propagate along null geodesics, guarantees that every symmetric hyperbolic system L which reproduces the Einstein's\nequations will necessary contain the metric light cone as its causal light cone\nassociated to L. It follows that the above prescription does indeed reproduce the\nusual metric definition of a black hole region for the vacuum Einstein equations.\n1.3.1\n\nDumb holes\n\nLet us illustrate the considerations of the previous section in the case of the\nEuler equations\n\u03c1 (v\u0307 + v * \u2207v) + \u2207p(\u03c1) = 0 ,\n\u03c1\u0307 + \u2207(\u03c1v) = 0 .\n\n(1.8)\n\nFor strictly positive \u03c1's (1.8) can be rewritten as a symmetric hyperbolic system\nof the form (1.1) with B = 0, for a field \u03c6 = (v i , \u03c1), by introducing the matrices\n!\n!\ni\n\u2032 i\n3 p \u03b4\n\u03c1v\nid\n3 0\n\u03c1id\nR\nR\nj\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\n, A =\n,\n(1.9)\nA0 =\n0 p\u03c1\np\u2032 \u03b4ji p\u03c1 v i\nwhich are clearly symmetric with respect to the standard scalar product on\nR3 \u00d7 R \u220b (v, \u03c1).

Our discussion above shows that neither the irrotationality\nof the flow, nor the perturbative character of the argument are essential for the\n\n\f10\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nproblem at hand. The fact that causality for the full non-linear Euler's equations\nis governed by a metric can essentially be found in Courant and Hilbert, and is\ncertainly well known to some researchers (H. Friedrich, private communication).\nThere was renewed interest in the above because of the recent experiments\nwith the Bose-Einstein condensates. Recall that in the Madelung formulation,\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation governing the dynamics of the condensates can be\nrewritten in Euler form. There have been suggestions that some of the effects\nassociated to black-hole type causality, including the analogue of the Hawking\nradiation, could be observed in such systems, see [10, 83, 131] and references\ntherein. While the resulting black holes are still referred to as sonic, this is rather\nmisleading as the underlying Gross-Pitaevskii equation does not have anything\nto do with sound propagation in liquid or gaseous physical media.\n1.3.2\n\nOptical holes\n\nAccording to M. Visser [128], in a dielectric fluid \"the refractive index n, the\nfluid velocity v, and the background Minkowski metric \u03b7 can be combined algebraically to provide an effective metric g\"\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (n2 \u2212 1)v\u03bc v\u03bd .\nThis leads to black-hole effective geometries for refractive indices which exceed 1\nin some regions. Phenomenological models for this behaviour have been proposed\nby U. Leonhardt and P. Piwnicki, cf. [95] and references therein7 . Similarly, a\n(different) effective metric is obtained in nonlinear electrodynamics, leading \u2013\naccording to [111] \u2013 to models which sometimes contain closed timelike curves.\nThe status of these \"analogous models\" seems to be somewhat less clear than\nthat of the sonic ones.\n1.3.3\n\nTrapped surfaces\n\nWe shall close this section by noting the discussion in [96, 129] concerning the\nnotion of trapped surfaces8 for black hole geometries \u2013 such surfaces are useful\ndetectors of black hole regions in GR with matter fields carying positive energy.\nIt should be borne in mind that while causality concepts can be introduced for\nany symmetric hyperbolic system, the existence of a trapped surface signals the\npresence of a black hole region only when causality is governed by a metric satisfying an energy positivity condition (and, if in a Scri context, when Scri satisfies\nvarious regularity conditions, see Section 1.4 below). In the non-gravitational\nblack hole models the metric is the one arising out of the causality structure of\nthe theory, and there are no reasons in general to believe that its Ricci tensor\nshould have any preferred properties; to start with, it is defined only up to a\nconformal factor anyway. In addition, the \"trapped surface\" terminology is used\n7\n8\n\nSee also URL http://www.st-and.ac.uk/~www_pa/group/quantumoptics\nCf. Section 1.6 for the differential-geometric definition of this notion\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n11\n\nin [129] for objects which are completely unrelated to the usual differential geometric context, which is extremely misleading and obscures the problems at\nhand.\n\n1.4\n\nStandard black holes\n\nThe standard way of defining black holes is by using conformal completions: A\npair (Me, g\u0303) is called a conformal completion of (M , g) if Me is a manifold with\nboundary such that:\n1. M is the interior of Me,\n2. there exists a function \u03a9, with the property that the metric g\u0303, defined to be\n\u03a9 2 g on M , extends by continuity to the boundary of Me, with the extended\nmetric still being non-degenerate throughout,\n3. \u03a9 is positive on M , differentiable on Me, vanishes on I , with d\u03a9 nowhere\nvanishing on I .\n\nWe emphasize that no assumptions about the causal nature of Scri are made\nso far. The boundary of Me will be called Scri, denoted I . In the usual textbooks [73, 132] smoothness of both the conformal completion and the metric g\u0303\nis imposed, though this can be weakened for many purposes. We set\nI + = {p \u2208 I | I \u2212 (p; Me) \u2229 M 6= \u2205} .\n\nAssuming various global regularity conditions on Me, to which we shall return\nin Sect. 1.4.1, one then defines the black hole region B as\nB := M \\ J \u2212 (I + ) .\n\n(1.13)\n\nLet us point out some drawbacks of this approach:\n\u2022 Non-equivalent Scri's: Conformal completions at null infinity do not have\nto be unique, an example can be constructed as follows: the Taub\u2013NUT\nmetrics can be locally written in the form [106]\n\u2212U \u22121 dt2 + (2L)2 U \u03c312 + (t2 + L2 )(\u03c322 + \u03c332 ) ,\nU (t) = \u22121 +\n\n2(mt+L2 )\nt2 +L2\n\n.\n\n(1.14)\n(1.15)\n\nwhere \u03c31 , \u03c32 and \u03c33 are left invariant one\u2013forms on SU (2) \u2248 S 3 . The constants L and m are real numbers with L > 0. Parameterizing S 3 with Euler\nangles (\u03bc, \u03b8, \u03c6) one is led to the following form of the metric\ng = \u2212U \u22121 dt2 + (2L)2 U (d\u03bc + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + (t2 + L2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) .\nThe standard\nway of performing extensions across the Cauchy horizons t\u00b1 :=\n\u221a\nM \u00b1 M 2 + L2 is to introduce new coordinates\nZ t\n[2LU (s)]\u22121 ds, \u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n(1.16)\n(t, \u03bc, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2192 (t, \u03bc \u00b1\nt0\n\n\f12\n\nP.

(1.17)\n\nEach of the metrics g\u00b1 can be smoothly conformally extended to the boundary at infinity \"t = \u221e\" by introducing\nx = 1/t ,\nso that (1.17) becomes\n\u0010\ng\u00b1 = x\u22122 \u2213 4L(d\u03bc + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)dx\n\n\u0011\n+(2L)2 x2 U (d\u03bc + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + (1 + L2 x2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) (. 1.18)\n\nIn each case this leads to a Scri diffeomorphic to S 3 . There is a simple\nisometry between g+ and g\u2212 given by\n(x, \u03bc, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2192 (x, \u2212\u03bc, \u03b8, \u2212\u03c6)\n\n(this does correspond to a smooth map of the region t \u2208 (t+ , \u221e) into itself,\ncf. [42]), so that the two Scri's so obtained are isometric. However, in addition\nto the two ways of attaching Scri to the region t \u2208 (t+ , \u221e) there are the\ntwo corresponding ways of extending this region across the Cauchy horizon\nt = t+ , leading to four possible manifolds with boundary. It can then be seen,\nusing e.g. the arguments of [42], that the four possible manifolds split into\ntwo pairs, each of the manifolds from one pair not being isometric to one from\nthe other. Taking into account the corresponding completion at \"t = \u2212\u221e\",\nand the two extensions across the Cauchy horizon t = t\u2212 , one is led to\nfour inequivalent conformal completions of each of the two inequivalent [42]\ntime-oriented, maximally extended, standard Taub-NUT space-times.\nUnder mild completeness conditions in the spirit of [66], uniqueness of\nI + as a point set in past-distinguishing space-times should follow from the\nTIP and TIF construction of [67]; however, uniqueness of Scri's differentiable\nstructure within that framework is far from being clear.\nYet another approach to uniqueness has been proposed by Geroch [65]:\nA completion as defined at the beginning of this section is said to be a\nregular asymptote if, given any point p \u2208 I , and any non-zero null vector\nl \u2208 Tq Me such that the maximally extended null geodesic with tangent l\ndoes not meet p, then there are neighbourhoods U \u2282 Me of p and V \u2282 T Me\nof l such that no maximally extended null geodesic with tangent in V meets\nU . This regularity condition is not satisfied by the Taub-NUT completions\ndescribed above. Supposing that the set of regular asymptotes is non-empty,\nGeroch [65, Theorem 2, p. 14] gives an argument for existence of a maximal\nregular asymptote, unique up to well behaved conformal transformations.\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n13\n\nNow, we have not been able to fill in the details9 of some of the arguments\nsuggested in [65], but the construction given is plausible enough so that we\nexpect that it might actually be correct. Whatever the case, Geroch's regularity requirement is a global condition which seems to be difficult to control\nin general situations.10 In particular it could happen that many space-times\nof interest admitting conformal completions do not admit any regular ones.\nIt should be borne in mind that one of the main applications of the I framework is the possibility of uniquely defining global charges such as mass, angular momentum, etc. (cf. [43] for a new approach to this question), in which\nissues about global behaviour of all geodesics seem completely irrelevant.\nThe fact that there is no suitable uniqueness result for the differentiable\nstructure of conformal completions is a serious gap in our understanding of\nobjects such as the Trautman-Bondi mass.\nWe note that uniqueness of a class of Riemannian conformal completions\nat infinity has been established in [41, Section 6]; this result can probably be\nused to obtain uniqueness of differentiable structure of Lorentzian conformal\ncompletions for Scri's admitting cross-sections. Further partial results on the\nproblem at hand can be found in [121].\n\u2022 Poorly differentiable Scri's: In all standard treatments [65, 73, 132] it is\nassumed that both the conformal completion Me = M \u222aI and the extended\nmetric g\u0303 are smooth, or have a high degree of differentiability [114]. This\nis a restriction which excludes most space-times which are asymptotically\nMinkowskian in lightlike directions, see [5, 90] and references therein. Poor\ndifferentiability properties of I change the peeling properties of the gravitational field [44], but most \u2013 if not all \u2013 essential properties of black holes\nshould be unaffected by conformal completions with, e.g., polyhomogeneous\ndifferentiability properties as considered in [6, 44]. It should, however, be\nborne in mind that the hypothesis of smoothness has been done in the standard treatments, so that in a complete theory the validity of various claims\nshould be reexamined. Some new results concerning existence of space-times\nwith a poorly differentiable Scri can be found in [94].\n\u2022 The structure of i+ : The current theory of black holes is entirely based\non intuitions originating in the Kerr and Schwarzschild geometries. In those\nspace-times we have a family of preferred \"stationary\" observers which follow\nthe orbits of the Killing vector field \u2202t in the asymptotic region, and their\npast coincides with that of I + . It is customary to denote by i+ the set con9\n\n10\n\nIt is not completely clear that the map \u03c6 defined by Geroch in his proof is simultaneously differentiable for all regular asymptotes, as asserted in [65, p. 14]. The regularity\ncondition guarantees Hausdorffness of the maximal regular asymptote constructed\nin [65, p. 14], but does not seem to guarantee its differentiability in any obvious way.\nGlobally hyperbolic conformal completions (in the sense of manifolds with boundary) should satisfy Geroch's condition. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that\ngood causal properties of a space-time might fail to survive the process of adding\na conformal boundary. For example, adding a Cauchy horizon to a maximal globally hyperbolic space-time sometimes leads to space-times which are not globally\nhyperbolic in the sense of manifolds with boundary.\n\n\f14\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nsisting of the points t = \u221e, where t is the Killing time parameter for those\nobservers. Now, the usual conformal diagrams for those space-times [73, 107]\nleave the highly misleading impression that i+ is a regular point in the conformally rescaled manifold, which, to the best of our knowledge, is not the\ncase. In dynamical cases the situation is likely to become worse. For example, one can imagine black hole space-times with a conformal diagram which,\nto the future of a Cauchy hypersurface t = 0, looks as in Fig. 1.3. In that\n\ni+\n\nsingularity\n\nE2\n\nE1\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n+\n\u2745I\n\u2745\nt=0\n\u2745r\n\nFig. 1.3. An asymptotically flat space-time with an unusual i+ .\n\ndiagram the set i+ should be thought of as the addition to the space-time\nmanifold M of a set of points \"{t = \u221e, q \u2208 O}\", where t \u2208 [0, \u221e) is the\nproper time for a family of observers O. The part of the boundary of Me\ncorresponding to i+ is a singularity of the conformally rescaled metric, but\nwe assume that it does not correspond to singular behaviour in the physical\nspace-time. In this space-time there is the usual event horizon E1 corresponding to the boundary of the past of I + , which is completely irrelevant for\nthe family of observers O, and an event horizon E2 which is the boundary of\nthe true black hole region for the family O, i.e., the region that is not accessible to observations for the family O. Clearly the usual black hole definition\ncarries no physically interesting information in such a setting.\n\u2022 Causal regularity of Scri: As already pointed out, in order to be able\nto prove interesting results the definition (1.13) should be complemented by\ncausal conditions on Me. The various approaches to this question, discussed\nin Sect. 1.4.1, are aesthetically highly unsatisfactory: it appears reasonable\nto impose causal regularity conditions on a space-time, but why should some\nunphysical completion have any such properties? Clearly, the physical properties of a black hole should not depend upon the causal regularity \u2013 or\nlack thereof \u2013 of some artificial boundary which is being attached to the\nspace-time. While it seems reasonable and justified to restrict attention to\nspace-times which possess good causal properties, it is not clear why the\naddition of artificial boundaries should preserve those properties, or even be\nconsistent with them. Physically motivated restrictions are relevant when\ndealing with physical objects, they are not when non-physical constructs are\nconsidered.\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n15\n\n\u2022 Inadequacy for numerical purposes: Several11 numerical studies of black\nholes have been performed on numerical grids which cover finite space-time\nregions [1, 2, 19, 86]. Clearly, it would be convenient to have a set-up which\nis more compatible in spirit with such calculations than the Scri one.\nWe will suggest, in Sections 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 below, two approaches in which\nthe above listed problems are avoided. Before doing this, let us complete the\npresentation of the usual, Scri based, approach to black holes.\n1.4.1\n\nScri regularity conditions, and the area theorem\n\nIt is easily seen that the definition (1.13) is not very useful without some completeness conditions on I + . For instance, denote by Me the standard conformal\ncompletion12 of the Minkowski space-time R1,3 , with I + \u2248 R \u00d7 S 2 , where the\nR factor is parameterized by a Bondi coordinate u, with u = t \u2212 r on R1,3 . One\ncan obtain a new completion Me2 by replacing I + by an open subset thereof,\ne.g. restricting the range of u's to (\u2212\u221e, 0). This will give a non-empty black hole\nregion B in R1,3 ,\nB = J + (0) ,\nwhich is clearly a completely uninteresting statement. A way out of this problem\n(as well as of some other related ones, discussed in [66]) has been proposed13\nin [66], for space-times which are vacuum near the conformal boundary, assuming\nthat the cosmological constant is zero: R. Geroch and G. Horowitz introduce a\npreferred family of conformal factors \u03a9 such that the matrix Hess\u03a9 of second\ncovariant derivatives of \u03a9 vanishes at I . It is then required that both I + and\nI \u2212 be diffeomorphic to R \u00d7 S 2 , with the R factor corresponding to integral\ne\ncurves of \u2207\u03a9,\nwhich are assumed to be complete.\nLet us pass to a presentation of the causal regularity conditions which are\nimposed in Hawking and Ellis's approach [73]. Now, a set of conditions is only\nuseful insofar as it allows to prove something. Since the \"area theorem\"14 is\none of the landmark theorems in the theory of black holes, we shall concentrate\non the set of conditions from Hawking and Ellis as used in their treatment of\nthe area theorem; we follow the presentation of [38, Appendix B]. One of the\nconditions of the Hawking\u2013Ellis area theorem [73, Proposition 9.2.7, p. 318] is\nthat spacetime (M , g) is weakly asymptotically simple and empty (\"WASE\", [73,\np. 225]). This means that there exists an open set U \u2282 M which is isometric\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n\nThe numerical simulations in [12, 16, 70] cover regions extending all the way to infinity, within frameworks which seem to be closely related to the \"naive\" framework\nof Section 1.8.1 below.\nInroduce coordinates u = t \u2212 r, x = 1/r, \u03b8, \u03c6 on R4 \\ {r = 0}, with (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2013 the\nusual spherical coordinates on R3 , and set I + := {x = 0} in those coordinates.\nThe \"WASE setup\" of [73], presented below, does not solve the problem, cf. [66].\nRecall that the area theorem is the statement that the area of cross-sections of event\nhorizons is non-increasing towards the future. One possible precise version of this\ntheorem can be found in Theorem 8 below.\n\n\f16\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nto U \u2032 \u2229 M \u2032 , where U \u2032 is a neighborhood of null infinity in an asymptotically\nsimple and empty (ASE) spacetime (M \u2032 , g \u2032 ) [73, p. 222]. It is further assumed\nthat M admits a partial Cauchy surface S with respect to which M is future\nasymptotically predictable ([73], p. 310). This is defined by the requirement that\nI + is contained in the closure of the future domain of dependence D+ (S ; M )\nof S , where the closure is taken in the conformally completed manifold M =\nM \u222a I + \u222a I \u2212 , with both I + and I \u2212 being null hypersurfaces. Next, one\nsays that (M , g) is strongly future asymptotically predictable ([73], p. 313) if it\nis future asymptotically predictable and if J + (S ) \u2229 J \u0304\u2212 (I + ; M ) is contained\nin D+ (S ; M ). Finally ([73], p. 318), (M , g) is said to be a regular predictable\nspace if (M , g) is strongly future asymptotically predictable and if the following\nthree conditions hold:\n(\u03b1) S \u2229J \u0304\u2212 (I + ; M ) is homeomorphic to R3 \\(an open set with compact closure).\n(\u03b2) S is simply connected.\n(\u03b3) the family of hypersurfaces S (\u03c4 ) constructed in [73, Proposition 9.2.3, p. 313]\nhas the property that for sufficiently large \u03c4 the sets S (\u03c4 ) \u2229 J \u0304\u2212 (I + ; M )\nare contained in J \u0304+ (I \u2212 ; M ).\nIt should be clear at this stage that this set of conditions is rather intricate.\nAs it turns out, it is not clear whether or not it does suffice for a proof of\nthe area theorem, as asserted in [73, Proposition 9.2.7, p. 318]: indeed, in the\nproof of [73, Proposition 9.2.1, p. 311] (which is one of the results used in the\nproof of [73, Proposition 9.2.7, p. 318]) Hawking and Ellis write: \"This shows\nthat if W is any compact set of S , every generator of I + leaves J + (W ; M ).\"\nThe justification of this given in [73] is wrong. If one is willing to impose the\nsentence in quotation marks as yet one more regularity hypothesis on I + , then\nthe arguments given in [73] apply to prove the area theorem for black holes with\na piecewise smooth event horizon; the results in [38] show that this remains true\nwith no supplementary conditions on the differentiability of the horizon.\nNot only is the above set of hypotheses aesthetically unappealing, it is far\nfrom being unique. An alternative way to guarantee that the area theorem will\nhold in the \"future asymptotically predictable WASE\" set\u2013up of [73] is to impose\nsome mild additional conditions on U and S . There are quite a few possibilities,\none such set of conditions has been described in [38, Appendix B]: Let \u03c8 : U \u2192\nU \u2032 \u2229 M \u2032 denote the isometry arising in the definition of the WASE spacetime\nM . First, one requires that \u03c8 can be extended by continuity to a continuous\nmap, still denoted by \u03c8, defined on U . Next, one demands that there exists a\ncompact set K \u2282 M \u2032 such that,\n\u03c8(J + (S ; M ) \u2229 \u2202U ) \u2282 J + (K; M \u2032 ) ,\n\n(1.19)\n\nsee Fig. 1.4. Under those conditions the area theorem does again hold.\nSeveral other proposals how to modify the WASE conditions of [73] to obtain\nsufficient control of the space\u2013times at hand have been proposed in [47, 89, 110].\nA completely different, and considerably simpler, treatment of the question of\nregularity of Scri needed for the area theorem, has been proposed in [38]: A point\n\n\f1\n+\nIM\n\n+\nIM\n\nU\n\n+\nIM\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8\n\nBlack holes\n\n17\n\n+\nIM\n\u2032\n\nC\u2032\n\nC\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03c8(\u03a9)\nU\u2032\n\nS\nU\n\nU\u2032\nK\n\nFig. 1.4. The set \u03a9 \u2261 J + (S ; M ) \u2229 \u2202U and its image under \u03c8.\n\nq in a set A \u2282 B is said to be a past point of A with respect to B if J \u2212 (q; B)\u2229A =\n{q}. One then says that I + is H \u2013regular if there exists a neighborhood O of\nH such that for every compact set C \u2282 O satisfying I + (C; M\u0304 ) \u2229 I + 6= \u2205 there\nexists a past point with respect to I + in \u2202I + (C; M\u0304 ) \u2229 I + . The condition of\nH \u2013regularity of I + is precisely what is needed for the arguments of the area\ntheorem to go through. This condition is somewhat related to the i0 -avoidance\ncondition used by Galloway and Woolgar [63].\nYet another approach has been advocated by Wald [132]: there one considers\nglobally hyperbolic completions in a set-up that includes i0 . While the conditions\nof [132] do lead to a coherent set-up for the validity of the area theorem, they\nintroduce several new difficulties related to the low differentiability of the conformally rescaled metric at i0 , not to mention the question of mere existence of\nsuch completions. This can actually be relaxed to the related weaker requirement\nof global hyperbolicity of M \u222a I + (in the sense of a manifold with boundary)\nwhich enforces H \u2013regularity of I + [38], so that the area theorem again holds.\n\n1.5\n\nHorizons\n\nA key notion related to the concept of a black hole is that of an event horizon,\nE := \u2202B .\n\n(1.20)\n\n(Actually, when E is not connected some care is required for a useful definition, but this does not affect the discussion that follows.) Event horizons are\na special case of a family of objects called future horizons: by definition, these\nare closed topological hypersurfaces H threaded by null geodesics, called generators, with no future end points, and possibly with past end points. At the\nlatter, differentiability of H breaks down in general; a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for this breakdown has been given in [14]. It seems that most authors\nhave been taking for granted that horizons are nice, piecewise smooth hypersurfaces. This is, however, not the case, and examples of nowhere C 1 horizons have\nbeen constructed in [40]. Further, nowhere C 1 horizons are generic in the class of\nconvex horizons in Minkowski space\u2013time [23]. This leads to various difficulties\nwhen trying to study their structure, e.g., attempting to prove results such as\n\n\f18\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nthe area theorem discussed in Sect. 1.4.1, compare Theorem 8 below. Horizons\nare always locally Lipschitz-continuous topological hypersurfaces [115] (compare\nCorollary A.3 below), i.e., they are locally graphs of functions satisfying\n|\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(y)| \u2264 C|x \u2212 y| .\nIn spite of the potential low differentiability, the usual optical scalars can be\ndefined almost everywhere in an Alexandrov sense, as follows: A function is said\nto be semi\u2013convex if it is the sum of a C 2 function and of a convex function.\nIt has been shown in [38]15 that future horizons are semi-convex. We give an\nalternative proof of this result in an appendix: the new argument has some\ninterest on its own, as it proceeds via a variational principle for horizons, which\ncould be useful for numerical applications. The interest of the semi-convexity\nproperty relies on the following theorem of Alexandrov:\nTheorem 2 (Alexandrov [52, Appendix E]) Semi\u2013convex functions f :\nB \u2192 R are \"twice\u2013differentiable\" almost everywhere in the following sense:\nthere exists a set BAl with full measure in B such that\n\u2200 x \u2208 BAl \u2203 Q \u2208 (Rp )\u2217 \u2297 (Rp )\u2217 such that \u2200 y \u2208 B\n\nf (y) \u2212 f (x) \u2212 df (x)(y \u2212 x) = Q(x \u2212 y, x \u2212 y) + r2 (x, y) ,\n\nwith r2 (x, y) = o(|x\u2212y|2 ). The symmetric quadratic form Q above will be denoted\nby 12 D2 f (x), and will be called the second Alexandrov derivative of f at x.\nPoints in BAl will be referred to as Alexandrov points of B.\nOne can now use Theorem 2 to define the equivalent to the usual divergence\n\u03b8 of the horizon, by writing H locally as the graph of a function f , and using\nthe second Alexandrov derivatives of f to define (almost everywhere on H )\nthe divergence \u03b8Al of the horizon. More precisely, let p = (t = f (q), q) be an\nAlexandrov point of H and let ei , i = 1, 2, 3 a basis of Tp H such that\ne3 = K\u03bc (p)dx\u03bc = \u2212dt + df (q) , g(e1 , e1 ) = (e2 , e2 ) = 1 , g(e1 , e2 ) = 0 .\nOne then sets\n2\n\u2207i Kj = Dij\nf \u2212 \u0393ij\u03bc K\u03bc ,\n\n\u03b8Al = (ei1 ej1 + ei2 ej2 )\u2207i Kj .\n\n2\nwhere the Hessian matrix Dij\nf above is that of second Alexandrov derivatives.\nThis reduces to the standard definition of \u03b8 when f \u2208 C 2 .\nSeveral results of causality theory go through with \u03b8 replaced by \u03b8Al , though\nthe standard arguments sometimes have to be replaced by completely different\nones, the reader is referred to [38] for details. In particular the Raychaudhuri\nequation, as well as the remaining optical equations, hold on almost all generators\nof H .\nSomewhat surprisingly, event horizons in smooth, stationary, globally hyperbolic, asymptotically flat space-times satisfying the null energy condition are\nalways smooth null hypersurfaces, analytic if the metric is analytic; this is a\ncorollary of the area theorem of [38].\n15\n\nSome further results concerning differentiability properties of horizons can be found\nin [14, 35, 39].\n\n\f1\n\n1.6\n\nBlack holes\n\n19\n\nApparent horizons\n\nIn spite of their name, apparent horizons are not horizons. They are usually [73]\ndefined on spacelike hypersurfaces S \u2282 M , as follows: let \u03a9 \u2282 M be the set\ncovered by (future) trapped surfaces: by definition, those are compact, boundaryless, smooth surfaces S \u2282 S with the property that\n\u03b8(S) := \u03bb \u2212 (g ij \u2212 ni nj )Kij < 0 ,\n\n(1.21)\ni\n\nwhere \u03bb is the (outwards) mean extrinsic curvature of S in S , n is the outwards\npointing unit normal to S in S , and Kij is the extrinsic curvature of S in M .\nThere is no reason for \u03a9 to be nonempty in general; on the other hand, in\nappropriately censored space-times, a non-empty \u03a9 implies the existence of a\nblack hole region. Hawking and Ellis define the apparent horizon A as\nA := \u2202\u03a9 ,\n\n(1.22)\n\n\u03b8(A ) = 0 .\n\n(1.23)\n\nand argue that\nTheir argument is correct if one assumes that A is C 2 . However, A could be\na priori a very rough set, with \u03b8 not even defined, in which case the arguments\nof [73] do not apply. Probably the simplest way out is to use (1.23) as the definition of apparent horizon, and forget about \u03a9. The existence of a C 2 compact,\nboundaryless surface satisfying (1.23) does again imply the existence of a black\nhole in a Scri framework, assuming appropriate causal properties of I + .\nWe note that if Kij = 0, then (1.22) is the equation for a minimal surface.\nNow, in the course of their proof of the Penrose inequality, G. Huisken and\nT. Ilmanen [80] prove that the outermost minimal (in the sense of calculus of\nvariations) surface is always smooth, which supports the validity of (1.23) at\nleast for the outermost component of A . However, they provide examples which\nshow that this outermost minimal surface might not be the boundary of \u03a9 in\ngeneral. This illustrates another deficiency of the definition (1.22). Some partial\nresults concerning the differentiability properties of A have been obtained by\nM. Kriele and S. Hayward in [88]. R. Howard and J. Fu have recently shown [79]\nthat \u2202\u03a9 satisfies (1.22) in a viscosity sense \u2013 this is defined as follows: Let D be\nan open set, and let p \u2208 \u2202D. Then U is an inner (outer) support domain if U\nis an open subset of D (of \u2201D), \u2202U is a C 2 hypersurface and p \u2208 \u2202U . One says\nthat \u03b8(\u2202D) \u2264 0 (respectively \u03b8(\u2202D) \u2265 0) in the viscosity sense if for any point\np \u2208 \u2202D and for any inner support (outer support) domain we have\n\u03b8(\u2202U )(p) \u2264 0\n\n(respectively \u03b8(\u2202U )(p) \u2265 0) .\n\nThis coincides with the usual inequality \u03b8 \u2264 0 (\u03b8 \u2265 0) on any subset of \u2202D which\nis C 2 . Finally \u03b8(\u2202D) = 0 in the viscosity sense if for any point p \u2208 \u2202D we have\nboth \u03b8(\u2202D) \u2264 0 in the viscosity sense, and \u03b8(\u2202D) \u2265 0 in the viscosity sense.\nb is the set covered by smooth\nIt is tempting to conjecture the following: if \u03a9\ncompact S's satisfying\n\u03b8(S) := \u03bb + (g ij \u2212 ni nj )Kij \u2264 0 ,\n\n\f20\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nb is smooth, separating, and\nthen any outermost connected component of \u2202 \u03a9\nsatisfies (1.22). When Kij = 0 this statement is known to be true by the already\nmentioned result of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen.\nWe refer the reader to [3, 72] and references therein for a numerical treatment\nof apparent horizons.\n\n1.7\n\nClassification of stationary solutions (\"No hair\ntheorems\")\n\nUniqueness theorems for stationary solutions have been one of the central fields\nof research in the theory of black holes, the reader is referred to [33, 34] and\nreferences therein for a review, as well as lists of open problems; cf. also [75, 76].\nActually the perspective here is somewhat larger, as one is interested in classifying all solutions, not only those that contain black holes. Since the time of writing\nof [33, 34] some progress has been made, both for zero and non-zero cosmological\nconstant; it is convenient to discuss various cases separately. Throughout this\nsection, stationary means that there exists an action of R on M by isometries,\nwith the orbits of the group being timelike sufficiently far away in an asymptotic region; strictly stationary means that the orbits are timelike everywhere.\nStationary black hole solutions are never strictly stationary.\n\u039b = 0: The following fundamental theorem has been recently proved by M. Anderson:\nTheorem 3 (Anderson [4]) The only geodesically complete strictly stationary\nsolutions of the vacuum Einstein equations which do not contain closed timelike\ncurves are the Minkowski space-time and quotients thereof.\nThis is a milestone result in general relativity, involving only the natural\ngeometric conditions of completeness together with absence of closed timelike\ncurves. This should be contrasted with the version of this result originating in\nLichnerowicz's work, the state-of-the art form of which, as based on previous\ntechniques, assumes in addition global hyperbolicity, and asymptotic flatness,\nand existence of a compact interior. Last but not least, the paper introduces\ntechniques which have not been used in mathematical general relativity so far,\nand which are likely to be useful tools in future work.\nIn the black hole case, the only significant progress made since the review\npaper [34] is for static black holes: In [36] the classification of static vacuum black\nholes which contain an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface with compact\ninterior has been, essentially,16 finished. This problem has a long history, starting with the pioneering work of Israel [81]. The most complete result existing\n16\n\nSome comments about the qualification \"essentially\" are in order: uniqueness theorems usually proceed in two steps, the first being the reduction of the problem to a\nRiemannian one, the second consisting of a uniqueness theorem for the Riemannian\nproblem. The latter part of the proof in [36] seems to be optimal; one could consider\nimproving the former, see [36] for a detailed discussion.\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n21\n\nin the literature prior to [36] was that of Bunting and Masood-ul-Alam [24]\nwho showed, roughly speaking, that all appropriately regular such black holes\nwhich do not contain degenerate horizons belong to the Schwarzschild family.\nIn [36] the condition of non-degeneracy of the event horizon is removed, showing that the Schwarzschild black holes exhaust the family of all appropriately\nregular black hole space-times. The proof requires an extension of the positive\nmass theorem which applies to asymptotically flat complete Riemannian manifolds, proved in [11]. The paper [37] contains an improvement of similar previous\nresults concerning the electro-vacuum black holes, under the restrictive condition that all degenerate components of the black hole carry charges of the same\nsign. This seems a reasonable condition from a physical point of view: opposite charges would attract, which added to the gravitational attraction should\nprevent the configuration from being static. However, a proper mathematical\ntreatment which would transform this argument into a proof is still missing.\n\u039b > 0: The natural boundary conditions for stationary solutions with \u039b > 0 are\nthe \"no boundary ones\": one considers globally hyperbolic space-times containing compact, boundaryless spatial surfaces. In this case there is no asymptotic\nregion, and stationarity is defined by the requirement that the set of points at\nwhich the Killing vector field is timelike is non-empty. In [92] J. Lafontaine and\nL. Rozoy have announced a complete classification of static space-times with\na compact (boundaryless) totally geodesic\np spacelike hypersurface S , under the\nassumption that the Lorentzian norm \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd X \u03bc X \u03bd of the Killing vector field\nis a Morse-Bott function, and that of analyticity17 of the metric on S . The\nhypothesis that S is totally geodesic is the usual hypothesis of staticity. This\nis the first result of such generality in this context. The proof is an extension\nof an argument of R. Beig and W. Simon [15] done in a related context, and\nproceeds by proving that the metric on S must be conformally flat; one can\nthen conclude using [91].\nUniqueness results under the completely different hypothesis of existence of\na conformal completion have been previously established by H. Friedrich [54]\nand by Boucher [17].\n\u039b < 0: Our understanding of the class of stationary space-times with a negative\ncosmological constant is much poorer than that of the \u039b = 0 ones. It seems\nthat the only results available so far concern static space-times. To start with,\nthe question of boundary conditions which should be imposed in the asymptotic\nregion are far from being understood, a beginning of a systematic analysis of this\nquestion can be found in [45]. A uniqueness argument for the de Sitter metric\nin the strictly stationary case has been proposed in [18]. It is only recently that\ncomplete proofs of the required positive energy theorem have been given [41, 134,\n17\n\nThis is a condition on the analyticity of the metric at the set of points at which\nthe Killing vector vanishes or becomes null, since the metric is necessarily analytic\nelsewhere.\n\n\f22\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\n136]; the results in [41] do actually lead to a uniqueness result under much weaker\nasymptotic conditions than originally suggested [18]. It should be pointed out\nthat the nature of the corresponding Riemannian problem is completely different\nfrom that of the asymptotically flat case: here one needs to analyze the set of\nsolutions of the equations for a Riemannian metric g and a function V on a three\ndimensional manifold S ,\n\u2206V = \u2212\u039bV ,\n\n(1.24)\n\nRij = V \u22121 Di Dj V + \u039bgij ,\n\n(1.25)\n\nand it is customary to assume that (S , g) can be conformally compactified. Now,\nthe uniqueness theorems mentioned require that V \u22122 g extends by continuity to a\nsmooth metric on the conformal boundary, with constant scalar curvature there.\nNo reasons are known why this should be the case, and it is conceivable that\nmore general static solutions would exist which do not satisfy this condition. It\nwould be of interest to construct such solutions, or to prove their non-existence.\nThe topology of the boundary of the conformally compactifiable solutions of\n(1.24)-(1.25) does not have to be spherical, as is the case for the anti-de Sitter\nmetric, while the uniqueness result mentioned above assumes that the boundary\nat infinity \u2202\u221e S is a sphere. When \u2202\u221e S is a torus, a strictly static solution\nhas been found by Horowitz and Myers [78]. The metric in n + 1 \u2265 4 spacetime\ndimensions is\nn\u22122\n\nds2 = \u2212r2 dt2 +\nwhere V (r) =\n\nr2\nl2\n\n\u0010\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c1n\nrn\n\n\u0011\n\nX\n1\n(dy i )2 ,\ndr2 + V (r)d\u03c62 + r2\nV (r)\ni=1\n\n(1.26)\n\n, l2 = \u2212 n(n\u22121)\n2\u039b , and \u03c1 is a constant. Regularity de2\n\ni\nmands that \u03c6 be identified with period \u03b20 = 4\u03c0l\nn\u03c1 . The periods of the y 's are\narbitrary. The space-time metric is \"asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter\" with\nboundary at conformal infinity foliated by spacelike (n\u22121)-tori. The time slices of\nspace-time itself, when conformally completed, have topology D2 \u00d7 T n\u22122, which\nin dimension 3+1 is a solid torus. Under a convexity condition on the conformal boundary, G. Galloway, S. Surya and E. Woolgar have proved a uniqueness\ntheorem for the corresponding metrics [62].\nThe above mentioned results concern the strictly static case, and the question of classification of black holes with a Killing vector which is not timelike\neverywhere is essentially open. In [45] an argument has been presented which\nshifts the problem of proving uniqueness of a class of such black holes to that\nof proving a Penrose-type inequality18 for conformally compactifiable Riemannian manifolds with minimal boundary, and with scalar curvature bounded from\nbelow by a negative constant. While there is some hope that some such results\ncould be proved by extending the arguments of [80], this remains to be seen.\n18\n\nA version of such an inequality has been originally proposed by Gibbons [69]; the\ninequality proposed there is not quite correct, see [45].\n\n\f1\n\n1.8\n\nBlack holes\n\n23\n\nBlack holes without Scri\n\nThere has been considerable progress in the numerical analysis of black hole\nsolutions of Einstein's equations; here one of the objectives is to write a stable\ncode which would solve the full four dimensional Einstein equations, with initial\ndata containing a non-connected black hole region that eventually merges into a\nconnected one. One wishes to be able to consider initial data which do not possess\nany symmetries, and which have various parameters \u2013 such as the masses of the\nindividual black holes, their angular momenta, as well as distances between them\n\u2013 which can be varied in significant ranges. Finally one wishes the code to run to\na stage where the solution settles to a state close to equilibrium. The challenge\nthen is to calculate the gravitational wave forms for each set of parameters,\nwhich could then be used in the gravitational wave observatories to determine\nthe parameters of the collapsing black holes out of the observations made. This\nprogram has been being undertaken for years by several groups of researchers,\nwith steady progress being made [1, 2, 12, 16, 19, 70, 71, 86, 93].19\nThere is a fundamental difficulty above, of deciding whether or not one is\ndealing indeed with the desired black hole initial data: the definition (1.13) of\na black hole requires a conformal boundary I satisfying some \u2013 if not all \u2013\nproperties discussed in Sect. 1.4.1. Clearly there is no way of ensuring those\nrequirements in a calculation performed on a finite space-time grid.20\nIn practice what one does is to set up initial data on a finite grid so that\nthe region near the boundary is close to flat (in the conformal approach the\nwhole asymptotically flat region is covered by the numerical grid, and does not\nneed to be near the boundary of the numerical grid; this distinction does not\naffect the discussion here). Then one evolves the initial data as long as the\ncode allows. The gravitational waves emitted by the system are then extracted\nout of the metric near the boundary of the grid. Now, our understanding of\nenergy emitted by gravitational radiation is essentially based on an analysis of\nthe metric in an asymptotic region where g is nearly flat. In order to recover\nuseful information out of the numerical data it is thus necessary for the metric\nnear the boundary of the grid to remain close to a flat one. If we want to be sure\nthat the information extracted contains all the essential dynamical information\nabout the system, the metric near the boundary of the grid should quiet down to\nan almost stationary state as time evolves. Now, it is straightforward to set-up\n19\n\n20\n\nSome spectacular visualizations of the calculations performed can be found at the\nURL http://jean-luc.aei.mpg.de/NCSA1999/GrazingBlackHoles\nThe conformal approach developed by Friedrich (cf., e.g., [56] and references therein,\nas well as S. Husa's and J. Frauendiener's contributions to this volume) provides an\nideal numerical framework for studying gravitational radiation in situations where\nthe extended space-time is smoothly conformally compactifiable across i+ , since then\none can hope that the code will be able to \"calculate Scri\" globally to the future of\nthe initial hyperboloidal hypersurface. It is not clear whether a conformal approach\ncould provide more information than the non-conformal ones when i+ is itself a\nsingularity of the conformally rescaled equations, as is the case for black holes.\n\n\f24\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\na mathematical framework to describe such situations without having to invoke\nconformal completions, this is done in the next section.\n1.8.1\n\nNaive black holes\n\nConsider a globally hyperbolic space-time M which contains a region covered by\ncoordinates (t, xi ) with ranges\nr :=\n\nsX\ni\n\n(xi )2 \u2265 R0 ,\n\nT0 \u2212 R0 + r \u2264 t < \u221e ,\n\n(1.27)\n\nsuch that the metric g satisfies there\n|g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd | \u2264 C1 r\u2212\u03b1 \u2264 C2 ,\n\n\u03b1>0,\n\n(1.28)\n\nfor some positive constants C1 , C2 , \u03b1; clearly C2 can be chosen to be less than\nor equal to C1 R0\u2212\u03b1 . Making R0 larger one can thus make C2 as small as desired,\ne.g.\nC2 = 10\u22122 ,\n(1.29)\nwhich is a convenient number in dimension \u221a\n3 + 1 to guarantee that objects\nalgebraically constructed out of g (such as g \u03bc\u03bd , det g) are well controlled; (1.29)\nis certainly not optimal, and any other number suitable for the purposes at hand\nwould do. To be able to prove theorems about such space-times one would need\nto impose some further, perhaps not necessarily uniform, decay conditions on a\nfinite number of derivatives of g; there are various possibilities here, but we shall\nignore this for the moment. Then one can define the exterior region Mext , the\nblack hole region B and the future event horizon E as\nMext := \u222a\u03c4 \u2265T0 J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R0 ) = J \u2212 (\u222a\u03c4 \u2265T0 S\u03c4,R0 ) ,\nB := M \\ Mext ,\n\nE := \u2202B ,\n\n(1.30)\n(1.31)\n\nwhere\nS\u03c4,R0 := {t = \u03c4, r = R0 } .\n\n(1.32)\n\nWe will refer to the definition (1.27)-(1.32) as that of a naive black hole.\nIn the setup of (1.27)-(1.32) an arbitrarily chosen R0 has been used; for this\ndefinition to make sense B so defined should not depend upon this choice. This\nis indeed the case, as can be seen as follows:\nProposition 4 Let Oa \u2282 R3 \\ B(0, R0 ), a = 1, 2, and let Ua \u2282 M be of the\nform {(t \u2265 T0 \u2212 R0 + r(x), x) , x \u2208 Oa } in the coordinate system of (1.28). Then\nI \u2212 (U1 ) = J \u2212 (U1 ) = I \u2212 (U2 ) = J \u2212 (U2 ) .\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n25\n\nProof. If \u0393 is a future directed causal path from p \u2208 M to q = (t, x) \u2208 U1 , then\nthe path obtained by concatenating \u0393 with the path [0, 1] \u220b s \u2192 (t(s) := t +\ns, x(s) := x) is a causal path which is not a null geodesic, hence can be deformed\nto a timelike path from p to (t + 1, x) \u2208 U1 . It follows that I \u2212 (U1 ) = J \u2212 (U1 );\nclearly the same holds for U2 . Next, let xa \u2208 Oa , and let \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 R3 \\B(0, R0 )\nbe any differentiable path such that \u03b3(0) = x1 and \u03b3(1) = x2 . Then for any t0 \u2265\nT0 \u2212 R0 + r(x1 ) the causal curve [0, 1] \u220b s \u2192 \u0393 (s) = (t := Cs + t0 , x(s) := \u03b3(s))\nwill be causal for the metric g by (1.28) if the constant C is chosen large enough,\nwith a similar result holding when x1 is interchanged with x2 . The equality\nI \u2212 (U1 ) = I \u2212 (U2 ) easily follows from this observation. \u2293\n\u2294\nSummarizing, Prop. 4 shows that there are many possible equivalent definitions\nof Mext : in (1.30) one can replace J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R0 ) by J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) for any R1 \u2265 R0 , but\nalso simply by J \u2212 ((t + \u03c4, q)), for any p = (t, q) \u2208 M which belongs to the region\ncovered by the coordinate system (t, xi ).\nThe following remarks concerning the definition (1.30)-(1.31) are in order:\n\n\u2022 For vacuum, stationary, asymptotically flat space-times the definition is\nequivalent to the usual one with I [46, Footnote 7, p. 572]; here the results of [49, 50] are used. However, one does not expect the existence of a\nsmooth I + to follow from (1.27)-(1.28) in general.\n\u2022 Suppose that M admits a conformal completion in the sense defined at the\nbeginning of Sect. 1.4, and that I is semi-complete to the future, in the sense\nthat the Geroch-Horowitz condition of the beginning of Sect. 1.4.1 holds with\nI \u2248 R \u00d7 S 2 there replaced by I \u2283 R+ \u00d7 S 2 . Then for any finite interval\n[T0 , T1 ] there exists R0 (T0 , T1 ) and a coordinate system satisfying (1.28) and\ncovering a set r \u2265 R0 (T0 , T1 ), T0 \u2212 R0 \u2264 t \u2264 T1 \u2212 R0 . This follows from\nthe Tamburino-Winicour construction of Bondi coordinates (u, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) near\nI + [124], followed by the introduction of the usual Minkowskian coordinates\nt = u+r, x = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, etc. The problem is that R(T1 , T2 ) could shrink to\nzero as T2 goes to infinity. Thus, when I + exists, conditions (1.27)-(1.28) are\nuniformity conditions on I + to the future \u2013 the metric remains uniformly\ncontrolled on a uniform neighbourhood of I + as the retarded time goes to\ninfinity.\n\u2022 It should not be too difficult to check whether or not the future geodesically\ncomplete space-times of Friedrich [53, 58] and of Christodoulou and Klainerman [31], or the Robinson-Trautman black-holes [32], admit coordinate\nsystems satisfying (1.27)-(1.28).\nIt is not clear if asymptotically flat space-times in which no such control is\navailable do exist at all; in fact, it is tempting to formulate the following version\nof the (weak) cosmic censorship conjecture:\n\n\f26\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nThe maximal globally hyperbolic development of generic21 , asymptotically flat, vacuum initial data contains a region with coordinates satisfying (1.27)-(1.28).\nWhatever the status of this conjecture, one can hardly envisage numerical simulations leading to the calculation of an essential fraction of the total energy\nradiated away in space-times in which some uniformity conditions do not hold.\n1.8.2\n\nQuasi-local black holes\n\nAs already argued, the naive approach of the previous section should be more\nconvenient for numerical simulations of black hole space-times, as compared to\nthe usual one based on Scri. It appears to be even more convenient to have a\nframework in which all the issues are localized in space; we wish to suggest such\na framework here. When numerically modeling an asymptotically flat spacetime, whether in a conformal or a direct approach, a typical numerical grid\nwill contain large spheres S(R) on which the metric is nearly flat, so that an\ninequality such as (1.28)-(1.29) will hold in a neighbourhood of S(R). On slices\nt = const the condition (1.28) is usually complemented with a fall-off condition\non the derivatives of the metric\n|\u2202\u03c3 g\u03bc\u03bd | \u2264 Cr\u2212\u03b1\u22121 ,\n\n(1.33)\n\nhowever condition (1.33) is inadequate in the radiation regime, where retarded\ntime derivatives of the metric are not expected to fall-off faster than r\u22121 . It\nturns out that there is a condition on derivatives of the metric in null directions\nwhich is fulfilled at large distance both in spacelike and in null directions: let\nKa , a = 1, 2, be null future pointing vector fields on S(R) orthogonal to S(R),\nwith K1 inwards pointing and K2 \u2013 outwards pointing; these vector fields are\nunique up to scaling. Let \u03b8a denote the associated null second fundamental forms\ndefined as\n\u2200 X, Y \u2208 T S(R) \u03c7a (X, Y ) := g(\u2207X Ka , Y ) .\n(1.34)\nIt can be checked, e.g. using the asymptotic expansions for the connection coefficients near I + from [43, Appendix C], that \u03c71 is negative definite and \u03c72 is\npositive definite for Bondi spheres S(R) sufficiently close to I + ; similarly for\nI \u2212 . This property is not affected by the rescaling freedom at hand. Following\nG. Galloway [60], a two-dimensional spacelike submanifold of a four-dimensional\nspace-time will be called weakly null convex if \u03c71 is semi-positive definite, with\nthe trace of \u03c72 negative.22 The null convexity condition is easily verified for\nsufficiently large spheres in a region asymptotically flat in the sense of (1.33).\n21\n\n22\n\nThe examples constructed by Christodoulou [29] with spherically symmetric gravitating scalar fields suggest that the genericity condition is unavoidable, though no\ncorresponding vacuum examples are known.\nGalloway defines null convexity through the requirement of positive definiteness of\n\u03c71 and negative definiteness of \u03c72 . However, he points out himself [60, p. 1472] that\nthe weak null convexity as defined above suffices for his arguments to go through.\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n27\n\nIt does also hold for large spheres in a large class of space-times with negative\ncosmological constant. The null convexity condition is then the condition which\nwe propose as a starting point to defining \"quasi-local\" black holes and horizons.\nThe point is that several of the usual properties of black holes carry over to the\nweakly null convex setting. In retrospect, the situation can be summarized as\nfollows: the usual theory of Scri based black holes exploits the existence of conjugate points on appropriate null geodesics whenever those are complete to the\nfuture; this completeness is guaranteed by the fact that the conformal factor goes\nto zero at the conformal boundary at an appropriate rate. Galloway's discovery\nin [60] is that weak null convexity of large spheres near Scri provides a second,\nin principle completely independent, mechanism to produce the needed focusing\nbehaviour.\nThroughout this section we will consider a globally hyperbolic space-time\n(M , g) with time function t. Let T \u2282 M be a finite union of connected timelike\nhypersurfaces T\u03b1 in M , we set\nS\u03c4 := {t = \u03c4 } ,\n\nT (\u03c4 ) := T \u2229 S\u03c4 ,\n\nT\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) := T\u03b1 \u2229 S\u03c4 .\n\n(1.35)\n\nFor further purposes anything that happens on the exterior side of T is completely irrelevant, so it is convenient to think of T as a boundary of M ; global\nhyperbolicity should then be understood in the sense that (M := M \u222a T , g) is\nstrongly causal, and that J + (p; M )\u2229J \u2212 (q; M ) is compact in M for all p, q \u2208 M .\nRecall that the null convergence condition is the requirement that\nRic(X, X) \u2265 0 for all X \u2208 T M .\n\n(1.36)\n\nWe have the following topological censorship theorem for weakly null convex\ntimelike boundaries:\nTheorem 5 (Galloway [60]) Suppose that a globally hyperbolic space-time (M , g)\nsatisfying the null convergence condition (1.36) has a timelike boundary T =\n\u222aI\u03b1=1 T\u03b1 and a time function t such that the level sets of t are Cauchy surfaces,\nwith each section T (\u03c4 ) of T being null convex. Then distinct T\u03b1 's cannot communicate with each other:\n\u03b1 6= \u03b2\n\nJ + (T\u03b1 ) \u2229 J \u2212 (T\u03b2 ) = \u2205 .\n\nAs is well known, topological censorship implies constraints on the topology:\nTheorem 6 (Galloway [60]) Under the hypotheses of Theorem 5 suppose further that the cross-sections T\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) of T\u03b1 have spherical topology.23 Then the\n\u03b1-domain of outer communication\nhhT\u03b1 ii := J + (T\u03b1 ) \u2229 J \u2212 (T\u03b1 )\n\n(1.37)\n\nis simply connected.\n23\n\nThe reader is referred to [61] and references therein for results without the hypothesis of spherical topology. The results there, presented in a Scri setting, generalize\nimmediately to the weakly null convex one.\n\n\f28\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nIt follows in particular from Theorem 6 that M can be replaced by a subset\nthereof such that T is connected in the new space-time, with all essential properties relevant for the discussion in the remainder of this section being unaffected\nby that replacement. We shall not do that, to avoid a lengthy discussion of which\nproperties are relevant and which are not, but the reader should keep in mind\nthat the hypothesis of connectedness of T can indeed be done without any loss\nof generality for most purposes.\nWe define the quasi-local black hole region BT\u03b1 and the quasi-local event\nhorizon ET\u03b1 associated with the hypersurface T\u03b1 by\nBT\u03b1 := M \\ J \u2212 (T\u03b1 ) ,\n\nET\u03b1 := \u2202BT\u03b1 .\n\n(1.38)\n\nIf T is the hypersurface \u222a\u03c4 \u2265T0 S\u03c4,R0 of Section 1.8.1 then the resulting black\nhole region coincides with that defined in (1.31), hence does not depend upon\nthe choice of R0 by Proposition 4; however, BT\u03b1 might depend upon the chosen\nfamily of observers T\u03b1 in general. It is certainly necessary to impose some further\nconditions on T to reduce this dependence. A possible condition, suggested by\nthe geometry of the large coordinate spheres considered in the previous section,\ncould be that the light-cones of the induced metric on T are uniformly controlled\nboth from outside and inside by those of two static, future complete reference\nmetrics on T . However, neither the results above, nor the results that follow,\ndo require that condition.\nThe Scri-equivalents of Theorem 6 [22, 46, 59, 61, 63, 84] allow one to control\nthe topology of \"good\" sections of the horizon, and for the standard stationary\nblack-holes this does lead to the usual S 2 \u00d7 R topology of the horizon [46, 73]. In\nparticular, in stationary, asymptotically flat, appropriately regular space-times\nthe intersection of a partial Cauchy hypersurface with an event horizon will\nnecessary be a finite union of spheres. In general space-times such intersections\ndo not even need to be manifolds: for example, in the usual spherically symmetric\ncollapsing star the intersection of the event horizon with level sets of a time\nfunction will be a point at the time of appearance of the event horizon. We refer\nthe reader to [38, Section 3] for other such examples, including one in which the\ntopology of sections of horizon changes type from toroidal to spherical as time\nevolves. This behaviour can be traced back to the existence of past end points\nof the generators of the horizon. Nevertheless, some sections of the horizon have\ncontrolled topology \u2013 for instance, we have the following:\nTheorem 7 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 5, consider a connected component T\u03b1 of T such that ET\u03b1 6= \u2205. Let\nC\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) := \u2202J + (T\u03b1 (\u03c4 )) .\nIf C\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u2229 ET\u03b1 is a topological manifold, then each connected component thereof\nhas spherical topology.\nProof. Consider the open subset M\u03c4 of M defined as\nM\u03c4 := I + (C\u03b1 (\u03c4 ); M ) \u2229 I \u2212 (T\u03b1 ; M ) \u2282 hhT\u03b1 ii .\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n29\n\nWe claim that (M\u03c4 , g|M\u03c4 ) is globally hyperbolic: indeed, let p, q \u2208 M\u03c4 ; global\nhyperbolicity of M shows that J \u2212 (p; M ) \u2229 J + (q; M ) is a compact subset of M ,\nwhich is easily seen to be included in M\u03c4 . It follows that J \u2212 (p; M\u03c4 ) \u2229 J + (q; M\u03c4 )\nis compact, as desired. By the usual decomposition we thus have\nM\u03c4 \u2248 R \u00d7 S ,\nwhere S is a Cauchy hypersurface for M\u03c4 . Applying Theorem 6 to the globally\nhyperbolic space-time M\u03c4 (which has a weakly null convex boundary T\u03b1 \u2229 {t >\n\u03c4 }) one finds that M\u03c4 is simply connected, and thus so is S. Since C\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) and\nE\u03b1 are null hypersurfaces in M , it is easily seen that the closure in M of the\nCauchy surface {0} \u00d7 S intersects E\u03b1 precisely at C\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u2229 ET\u03b1 . It follows that\nS is a compact, simply connected, three dimensional topological manifold with\nboundary, and a classical result [74, Lemma 4.9] shows that each connected\ncomponent of \u2202S is a sphere. The result follows now from \u2202S \u2248 C\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u2229 ET\u03b1 .\n\u2294\n\u2293\nYet another class of \"good sections\" of ET can be characterized24 as follows:\nsuppose that hhT\u03b1 ii \u2229 S\u03c4 is a submanifold with boundary of M which is, moreover, a retract of hhT\u03b1 ii. Then hhT\u03b1 ii \u2229 S\u03c4 is simply connected by Theorem 6,\nand spherical topology of all boundary components of hhT\u03b1 ii \u2229 S\u03c4 follows again\nfrom [74, Lemma 4.9]. It is not clear whether there always exist time functions\nt such that the retract condition is satisfied; similarly it is not clear that there\nalways exist \u03c4 's for which the conditions of Theorem 7 are met for metrics which\nare not stationary (one would actually want \"a lot of \u03c4 's\"). It would be of interest\nto understand this better.\nWe have an area theorem for ET :\nTheorem 8 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 5, suppose further that ET 6=\n\u2205. Let Sa , a = 1, 2 be two achronal spacelike embedded hypersurfaces of C 2\ndifferentiability class, set Sa = Sa \u2229 ET . Then:\n1. The area of Sa is well defined.\n2. If\nS1 \u2282 J \u2212 (S2 ) ,\nthen the area of S2 is larger than or equal to that of S1 . (Moreover, this\nis true even if the area of S1 is counted with multiplicity25 of generators\nprovided that S1 \u2229 S2 = \u2205.)\nWe note that point 1 is less trivial as it appears, because horizons can be\nrather rough sets, and it requires a certain amount of work to establish that\nclaim.\n24\n\n25\n\nI am grateful to G. Galloway for useful discussions concerning this question, as well\nas many other points presented in this section.\nSee [38] for details.\n\n\f30\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nProof. The result is obtained by a mixture of methods of [38] and of [60], and\nproceeds by contradiction: assume that the Alexandrov divergence \u03b8Al of ET is\nnegative, and consider the S\u01eb,\u03b7,\u03b4 deformation of the horizon as constructed in\nProposition 4.1 of [38], with parameters chosen so that \u03b8\u01eb,\u03b7,\u03b4 < 0. Global hyperbolicity implies the existence of an achronal null geodesic from S\u01eb,\u03b7,\u03b4 to some cut\nT (\u03c4 ) of T . The geodesic can further be chosen to be \"extremal\", in the sense\nthat it meets T (t) for the smallest possible value of t among all generators of\nthe boundary of J + (S\u01eb,\u03b7,\u03b4 ) meeting T . The argument of the proof of Theorem 1\nof [60] shows that this is incompatible with the null energy condition and with\nweak null convexity of T (\u03c4 ). It follows that \u03b8Al \u2265 0, and the result follows from\n[38, Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 6.1]. \u2293\n\u2294\nIt immediately follows from the proof above that, under the hypotheses of Theorem 5, the occurrence of twice differentiable future trapped (compact) surfaces\nimplies the presence of a black hole region. The same result holds for semi-convex\ncompact surfaces which are trapped in an Alexandrov sense, that is, (1.21) holds\nwith \u03bb there defined in a way which should be clear from the discussion following Theorem 2. It is, however, not known if the existence of marginally trapped\nsurfaces \u2013 whether defined in a classical, or Alexandrov, or a viscosity sense \u2013\ndoes signal the occurrence of black hole; it would be of interest to settle that.\nIn summary, we have shown that the quasi-local black holes, defined using\nweakly null convex timelike hypersurfaces, or boundaries, possess several properties usually associated with the Scri-based black holes, without the associated\nproblems. We believe they provide a reasonable alternative, well suited for numerical calculations. In the next section we address the question of numerically\nfinding the resulting horizons.\n1.8.3\n\nFinding horizons\n\nConsider the large coordinate spheres S\u03c4,R1 of Section 1.8.1; under reasonable\nrestrictions on M one would expect that \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) converges as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e - e.g.\nin Hausdorff topology - to the event horizon E of (1.31). Similarly, the achronal\nboundaries \u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c4 )) should sometimes converge to the event horizon ET .\nWhenever that is the case, the \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 )'s or the \u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c4 ))'s can be taken\nas good approximations of the event horizon when \u03c4 is chosen to be large enough.\nThis is of practical significance, as it provides a way of approximately locating\nthe horizon in numerical simulations. Let us establish one such approximation\nresult, for the \u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c4 ))'s; clearly the corresponding result for the J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 )'s\nfollows by specialization. We assume that M is spatially compact and globally\nhyperbolic, which seem rather natural assumptions in the context of numerical\nsimulations of space-times:\nTheorem 9 Consider a globally hyperbolic space-time (M , g) with compact Cauchy\nhypersurfaces S\u03c4 and timelike boundary T , and suppose that\nBT 6= \u2205 .\n\n(1.39)\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n31\n\nThen for any \u03c4 we have\n\u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) \u2229 S\u03c4 \u2192\u03c3\u2192\u221e ET \u2229 S\u03c4 ,\nwhere the convergence is in Hausdorff distance.\nProof. Under the usual identification of M with R \u00d7 S0 , let f be the graphing\nfunction of \u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) over the projection pr2 E of E on S0 ; pr2 E is an open\nsubset of S0 by the invariance-of-the-domain theorem. If p = (t, x) is such that\nt < f (x), then there exists a causal curve from p to T , hence p \u2208 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) for\nsome \u03c3. It follows that\npr2 E = \u222a\u03c3 pr2 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) .\nLet f\u03c3 be the graphing function of \u2202J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) over pr2 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) \u2282 S0 ; clearly\npr2 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) \u2282 pr2 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3 \u2032 ))\n\n\u03c3 < \u03c3\u2032 ,\n\nwhich shows that f and all the f\u03c3\u2032 's are defined on pr2 J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) for \u03c3 \u2032 > \u03c3. The\nf\u03c4 's are uniformly Lipschitz and bounded over any compact subset K \u2282 pr2 E of\nS0 , and hence for any sequence \u03c4i there exists a subsequence such that the f\u03c4ij 's\nconverge to a Lipschitz function h. Since f\u03c4 \u2264 f for all \u03c4 we have h \u2264 f |K . Suppose that there exists x such that h(x) < f (x), then p = ((h(x) + f (x)) /2, x)\nis in J \u2212 (T ), hence in J \u2212 (T (\u03c3)) for some \u03c3, so that (h(x) + f (x)) /2 \u2264 f\u03c3 (x)\nwhich is not possible; we thus have h = f |K . It follows that the f\u03c4 's converge\npointwise to f . The f\u03c4 's are monotonously increasing as \u03c4 increases, and Dini's\ntheorem implies that the f\u03c4 's converge uniformly to f over any compact set. The\nresult follows now by elementary considerations using the fact that ET \u2229 S\u03c4 is\ncompact, being the intersection of a closed set with a compact one. \u2293\n\u2294\nTheorem 9 gives partial justification for the numerical analysis of Aninos [7],\nLibson et al. [98], or Mass\u00f3 et al. [102],26 where the event horizon E is taken to\nbe\nE \u2248 \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) , \u03c4 as big as the computer simulation allows .\nIn those works \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) is further numerically approximated as the solution\nof an eikonal equation, which leads to difficulties at past end points of the generators of \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ). We conjecture that a more stable method of locating\nobjects such as \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) is provided by the following straightforward modification of the Fermat-type variational principle presented in the Appendix below,\nsee (1.43): let P(x) be defined as in the paragraph preceding (1.43), with H\u03c3\nthere replaced by S\u03c4,R1 , and let \u03b3\u0302 be the null lifts of paths \u03b3 as defined in the\n26\n\nWe note that the claim in [7, 98], that the horizon acts as an attractor for backwardsdirected null geodesics, does not seem to be justified. In fact, such a statement is\ncoordinate-dependent: it is easy to introduce coordinate systems in the Schwarzschild\nspace-time where backwards-directed null geodesics will be actually repelled by the\nhorizon.\n\n\f32\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nparagraph preceding (1.45). An argument similar to that of the proof of Corollary A.3 shows that in globally hyperbolic space-times the set \u2202J \u2212 (S\u03c4,R1 ) is a\ngraph of a function f such that\nf (x) = sup t(\u03b3\u0302(a)) .\n\n(1.40)\n\n\u03b3\u0302\u2208P(x)\n\nSuch a maximization over null lifts \u03b3\u0302 of paths \u03b3 which have image in a fixed\nspacelike hypersurface should be easy to perform numerically by e.g. Newton's\nmethod. The variational principle above automatically takes care of the past\nend-points of the horizon.\nAcknowledgements The author is grateful to Y. Choquet-Bruhat, G. Horowitz,\nS. Husa, R. Narayan, R.

We emphasize that the generators are allowed to have past endpoints on H , but no future endpoints. Past\nnull geodesically ruled hypersurfaces are defined by changing the time orientation. Examples of future geodesically ruled hypersurfaces include past Cauchy\nhorizons D\u2212 (\u03a3) of achronal sets \u03a3 [115, Theorem 5.12] and black hole event\nhorizons \u2202J \u2212 (I + ) [73, p. 312].\nLet dimM = n + 1 and suppose that O is a domain in Rn . Recall that\na continuous function f : O \u2192 R is called semi\u2013convex if there exists a C 2\nfunction \u03c6 : O \u2192 R such that f + \u03c6 is convex. We shall say that the graph\nof f is a semi\u2013convex hypersurface if f is semi\u2013convex. A hypersurface H in a\nmanifold M will be said semi\u2013convex if H can be covered by coordinate patches\nU\u03b1 such that H \u2229 U\u03b1 is a semi\u2013convex graph for each \u03b1.\nConsider an achronal hypersurface H 6= \u2205 in a globally hyperbolic space\u2013\ntime (M, g). Let t be a time function on M which induces a diffeomorphism of M\nwith R\u00d7\u03a3 in the standard way [64, 122], with the level sets \u03a3\u03c4 \u2261 {p|t(p) = \u03c4 } of\nt being Cauchy surfaces. As usual we identify \u03a30 with \u03a3, and in the identification\nabove the curves R \u00d7 {q}, q \u2208 \u03a3, are integral curves of \u2207t. Define\n\u03a3H = {q \u2208 \u03a3|R \u00d7 {q} intersects H } .\n\n(1.41)\n\nFor q \u2208 \u03a3H the set (I \u00d7 q) \u2229 H is a point by achronality of H , we shall denote\nthis point by (f (q), q). Thus an achronal hypersurface H in a globally hyperbolic\nspace\u2013time is a graph over \u03a3H of a function f . The invariance-of-the-domain\ntheorem shows that \u03a3H is an open subset of \u03a3. We have the following:\n\n\f1\n\nBlack holes\n\n33\n\nTheorem A.1 Let H 6= \u2205 be an achronal future null geodesically ruled hypersurface in a globally hyperbolic space\u2013time (M = R\u00d7\u03a3, g). Then H is the graph\nof a semi\u2013convex function f defined on an open subset \u03a3H of \u03a3, in particular\nH is semi\u2013convex.\nProof. As discussed above, H is the graph of a function f . The idea of the proof\nis to show that f satisfies a variational principle, the semi\u2013concavity of f follows\nthen by a standard argument. Let p \u2208 H and let O be a coordinate patch in a\nneighborhood of p such that x0 = t, with O of the form I \u00d7 B(3R), where B(R)\ndenotes a coordinate ball centered at 0 of radius R in R3 , with p = (t(p), 0).\nHere I is the range of the coordinate x0 , we require it to be a bounded interval\nthe size of which will be determined later on. We further assume that the curves\nI \u00d7 {x}, x \u2208 B(3R), are integral curves of \u2207t. Define\nU0 = {x \u2208 B(3R)| the causal path I \u220b t \u2192 (t, x) intersects H } .\nWe note that U0 is non\u2013empty, since 0 \u2208 U0 . Set\nH\u03c3 = H \u2229 \u03a3\u03c3 ,\n\n(1.42)\n\nand choose \u03c3 large enough so that O \u2282 I \u2212 (\u03a3\u03c3 ). Now p lies on a future inextensible generator \u0393 of H , and global hyperbolicity of (M, g) implies that \u0393 \u2229 \u03a3\u03c3\nis nonempty, hence H\u03c3 is nonempty.\nFor x \u2208 B(3R) let P(x) denote the collection of piecewise differentiable\nfuture directed null curves \u0393 : [a, b] \u2192 M with \u0393 (a) \u2208 R \u00d7 {x} and \u0393 (b) \u2208 H\u03c3 .\nWe define\n\u03c4 (x) = sup t(\u0393 (a)) .\n(1.43)\n\u0393 \u2208P(x)\n\nWe emphasize that we allow the domain of definition [a, b] to depend upon \u0393 ,\nand that the \"a\" occurring in t(\u0393 (a)) in (1.43) is the lower bound for the domain\nof definition of the curve \u0393 under consideration. We have the following result\n(compare [8, 68, 116]):\nProposition A.2 (Fermat principle) For x \u2208 U0 we have\n\u03c4 (x) = f (x) .\nProof. Let \u0393 be any generator of H such that \u0393 (0) = (f (x), x), clearly \u0393 \u2208\nP(x) so that \u03c4 (x) \u2265 f (x). To show that this inequality has to be an equality,\nsuppose for contradiction that \u03c4 (x) > f (x), thus there exists a null future directed curve \u0393 such that t(\u0393 (0)) > f (x) and \u0393 (1) \u2208 H\u03c3 \u2282 H . Then the curve\n\u0393\u0303 obtained by following R \u00d7 {x} from (f (x), x) to (t(\u0393 (0)), x) and following \u0393\nfrom there on is a causal curve with endpoints on H which is not a null geodesic.\nBy [73, Proposition 4.5.10] \u0393\u0303 can be deformed to a timelike curve with the same\nendpoints, which is impossible by achronality of H . \u2293\n\u2294\nThe Fermat principle, Proposition A.2, shows that f is a solution of the variational principle (1.43). Now this variational principle can be rewritten in a\n\n\f34\n\nP. T. Chru\u015bciel\n\nsomewhat more convenient form as follows: The identification of M with R \u00d7 \u03a3\nby flowing from \u03a30 \u2261 \u03a3 along the gradient of t leads to a global decomposition\nof the metric of the form\ng = \u03b1(\u2212dt2 + ht ) ,\nwhere ht denotes a t\u2013dependent family of Riemannian metrics on \u03a3. Any future\ndirected differentiable null curve \u0393 (s) = (t(s), \u03b3(s)) satisfies\ndt(s) q\n= ht(s) (\u03b3\u0307, \u03b3\u0307) ,\nds\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0307 is a shorthand for d\u03b3(s)/ds.

It follows that\nf (x) + C|x|2\u03b4 = \u03c4 (x) + C|x|2\u03b4 = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc(x) + C|x|2\u03b4 = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c8(x)\nis convex, which is what had to be established. \u2293\n\u2294\n\nReferences\n1.
