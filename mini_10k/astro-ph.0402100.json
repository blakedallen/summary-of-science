Introduction\nThe origin and star formation history in \u03c9 Centauri, the\nmost luminous and massive globular cluster in our Galaxy,\nis one of the most intriguing problems of modern stellar astrophysics. \u03c9 Centauri is the only known Galactic\nglobular cluster which shows clear variations in the metal\ncontent of its giants. This evidence has been firmly estabilished in the past by extensive low (Norris et al. 1996,\nSuntzeff & Kraft 1996) and high resolution (Norris & Da\nCosta 1995, Smith et al. 2000) spectroscopic surveys. More\nrecently, the scenario has become more complicated due\nto the discovery of an additional, metal-rich population\nwith its own distinct RGB (hereafter RGB-a) that contains approximately 5% of the red giants in \u03c9 Cen (Lee et\nal. 1999, Pancino et al. 2000, 2002). In spite of the huge\nobservational effort carried out so far, the global picture\nof the cluster formation and evolution is far from being\ncompletely understood.\nIn this framework, we have started a long\u2013term project\ndevoted to the detailed study of the properties of the different stellar populations in this cluster (see the overview\nof the project by Ferraro, Pancino & Bellazzini, 2001).\nWithin this project a number of results have been pubSend offprint requests to: A. Sollima\n\u22c6\nBased on UVES observations collected at the European\nSouthern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, within the observing\nprogrammes 64.N-0038 and 68.D-0287.\n\nlished, in particular on the identification of the anomalous\nRGB-a, and on the definition of its chemical and kinematic\nproperties (see Pancino et al. 2000, 2002, 2003; Bellazzini\net al. 2001; Ferraro et al. 2002; Origlia et al. 2002). Most of\nthe actual observational knowledge comes from the optical\n(photometric or spectroscopic) study of RGB stars. Only\na few sparse literature of near infrared observations existed up to now. Two pioneering studies by Glass & Feast\n(1973, 1977) and Persson et al. (1980) present J, H and K\nmagnitudes for a few tens of bright giants. More recently,\nthe NICMOS camera on board of HST has been used by\nPulone et al. (1998) to obtain extremely deep photometry of a tiny area (20\" \u00d7 20\") 7 arcminutes away from the\ncluster center. The 2MASS survey has instead covered a\nvery wide area (3\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 ) around \u03c9 Cen, which however\ndoes not include the central region of the cluster. This paper presents a large J and K photometric catalog of more\nthan 73,000 stars in an area covering \u223c 13\u2032 \u00d7 13\u2032 around\nthe center of \u03c9 Cen. By combining the IR-data set with\nwide field optical photometry (Pancino et al. 2000, 2003),\nwe measured the complete set of morphological parameters defined by Ferraro et al. (2000, hereafter F00), which\nfully characterize the photometric properties of the RGB\nof different populations in \u03c9 Centauri.\n\n\f2\n\nA.

Observational Material\nA large set of J and K images were obtained at ESO,\nLa silla (Chile), during two observing runs (Run #1 and\n#2, see Table 1) at the New Technology Telescope (NTT)\nusing the near-IR imager/spectrometer SOFI. The observations were secured as back-up programmes. SOFI\nis an imager/spectrometer equipped with a 1024 \u00d7 1024\nRockwell IR-array detector. All the observations presented\nhere were performed with a scale of 0.292\u2032\u2032 /pixel, fixing a\nglobal FoV of \u223c 5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 each field.\nDuring Run#1, we covered the central region of the\ncluster with a mosaic of nine partially overlapping fields\n(hereafter Science-fields), sampling a total area of \u223c 13\u2032 \u00d7\n13\u2032 around the cluster center (see Figure 1). A set of high\nS/N flatfields in each filter has been obtained with an halogen lamp, alternatively switched on and off. For each field\nobserved in the cluster, a corresponding sky-field has been\nalso observed (\u223c 10 arcmin away from the cluster center)\nusing the same instrument configuration. Each sky-image\nwas obtained as the median of at least 5 frames, shifted\nby some hundreds of pixels with respect to each other.\nThe final set consists of 18 sky\u2013subtracted and flatfield\ncorrected images, 9 for each filter.\nDuring Run#2 a set of 4 additional fields (hereafter\nCalibration-fields), entirely within the area sampled in\nRun#1, have been obtained for photometric calibration\npurposes. The same pre-reduction procedure used for the\nScience-fields has been also applied to the Calibrationfields.\nAll photometric reductions were carried out using\nROMAFOT (Buonanno et al. 1983). The details of the re-\n\nduction procedure have already been reported in previous\npapers (Ferraro et al. 1994, Ferraro et al. 1995). We just\nmention here that for the IR\u2013frames we used the PSF\u2013\nfitting routine specifically modified to deal with undersampled stellar images (Buonanno & Iannicola, 1988). The\nsource detection was performed independently on each\nfield; more than 80,000 separate stars have been detected\nin total in the nine science fields observed during Run#1.\n\n2.1. Photometric Calibration\nDuring Run#2, a set of nine standard stars from the\nPersson et al. (1998) list has been observed together with\nthe 4 Calibration-fields in the cluster. Five measurements\nfor each standard have been secured and averaged, for\neach filter. The calibrating equations linking the aperture\nphotometry to the standard system are:\nK = k + 22.30 \u00b1 0.02\nJ = j + 23.03 \u00b1 0.02\nwhere j and k are the instrumental magnitudes, J and\nK the calibrated ones. The existence of a slight residual\ncolour equation (with slope < 0.01) in both filters cannot\nbe totally excluded.\nThe two above equations have been used to calibrate\nthe 4 Calibration-fields in \u03c9 Cen: as usual the most isolated\nand bright stars in the field have been employed to link the\naperture magnitudes to the fitting instrumental ones, after\nnormalizing for exposure time and correcting for airmass.\n\n\fA.

(K, J \u2212 K) color magnitude diagram for \u223c 73,000\nstars measured in \u03c9 Cen.\n\nA catalog with more than 10,000 calibrated stars in the\ncluster has been produced that has been used to calibrate\nthe global IR catalog, including more than 73,000 stars.\nOur calibration has been compared with the previous photometric catalogues. Unfortunately, only 8 stars\nwere found in common between the present catalog and\nthe pioneering work by Persson et al. (1980), while no\nstar are common with the very deep study by Pulone\net al. (1998). The average magnitude differences found\nare \u2206J = 0.034 \u00b1 0.063 and \u2206K = 0.093 \u00b1 0.079 ,fully\nconsistent with no systematic offset between our catalog\nand the one by Persson et al. (1980) within the errors.\nA much more significant comparison can be achieved with\nthe 2MASS catalog 1 (see also Section 5), showing that our\ncalibrated magnitudes are in very good agreement with\nthe 2MASS photometric system (\u2206J = 0.00 \u00b1 0.10 and\n\u2206K = \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.10).\nFig. 4.

Astrometry and Resulting Catalog\nThe photometrically calibrated catalog has been compared with the large proper motion one by van Leeuwen\net al. (2000), that lists accurate positions for more than\n10,000 red giants in \u03c9 Cen.

Colour Magnitude Diagrams\nThe main features of the CMDs presented in Figures 3\nand 4 are schematically listed below:\n1. The CMDs sample the entire evolved populations in\nthe cluster, reaching the TO region (K \u223c 17).\n2. The complex structure of the RGB in \u03c9 Cen is clearly\nvisible, starting from the blue side, where the dominant\nmetal-poor population defines the main RGB (RGBMP).\n3. The anomalous RGB (RGB-a, as defined by Pancino\net al. 2000), is clearly visible as a well separated population at the extreme red side of the main RGB structure, having K < 13 and (J \u2212 K) > 0.6 (see Figure 3)\nand (B \u2212 K) > 3.4 (see Figure 4).\n4. An intermediate RGB component (RGB-MInt), which\nuniformly populates the CMD region between the\nRGB-MP and the RGB-a, can also be easily noticed.\n5. The AGB stars appear well separated from the RGB\nin both CMDs.\n6.

However,\nRGB-a stars are well separated from the remaining populations when selected from the optical-infrared CMD of\nFigure 4. The contamination of the RGB-MP population\nfrom the RGB-MInt stars can be quantified in < 10% ,\nwith negligible impact on the ridge line determination of\nthe former. Figure 5 shows the adopted selection boxes\nfor the RGBs of the different populations. We used a loworder polynomial to fit the selected stars and an iterative\nprocedure to automatically reject stars lying more then\n2\u03c3 away from the best-fit line. The iteration was carried\non until convergence to a stable fit was obtained. The resulting mean ridge lines in various planes are reported in\nTable 3 (for the RGB-MP) and Table 4 (for the RGB-a).\nIn order to convert the derived RGB mean ridge lines\nto the absolute MK , (J \u2212 K)0 and MK , (V \u2212 K)0 planes\nand to measure the photometric indices and morphology\nparameters defined by F00 (see Section 4), we need to\nmake some basic assumptions for the metallicity, reddening and distance for the sub-populations of \u03c9 Cen.\n\nFig. 6. Fiducial ridge lines in the MK ,(J \u2212 K)0 plane\n(panel a) and in the MK ,(V \u2212 K)0 plane (panel b) for\na few GGCs of F00 and for the two populations of \u03c9 Cen.\n\n3.1. Metallicity\nFor the dominant metal-poor (RGB-MP) population we\nadopted the metallicity obtained by the most extensive\nspectroscopic survey performed in \u03c9 Cen by Norris et al.\n1996, who provided a peak value of [Ca/H] = \u22121.4 \u00b1\n0.1. By using the stars in our sample which have both\n[Ca/H] from Norris et al. 1996 and [Fe/H] aboundances\nfrom Suntzeff & Kraft 1996, we translated the [Ca/H]\npeak assumed above into [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.6 \u00b1 0.1 . Both\nhigh-resolution optical spectra (Pancino et al., 2002) and\nmedium-resolution IR spectra (Origlia et al., 2003) suggest a significantly higher metallicity for the anomalous\n(RGB-a) population, [Fe/H]= \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.15.\nStraniero & Chieffi (1991) and Salaris, Chieffi &\nStraniero (1993) showed that, when computing the\nisochrones of Population II stars, the contribution of the\n\u03b1-element enhancement can be taken into account by simply rescaling standard models to the global metallicity\n[M/H], according to the following relation\n[M/H] = [Fe/H] + log10 (0.638f\u03b1 + 0.362)\nwhere f\u03b1 is the enhancement factor for the \u03b1-elements.\nWe assumed [\u03b1/Fe]\u2243 +0.3 for the RGB-MP (Norris & Da\nCosta 1995, Smith et al. 2000) and a lower enhancement\n[\u03b1/Fe]\u2243 +0.1 for the RGB-a, according to Pancino et al.\n(2002) and Origlia et al. (2003). Therefore, we obtained\na global metallicity of [M/H]= \u22121.39 \u00b1 0.10 and [M/H]=\n\u22120.53\u00b10.21 for the RGB-MP and the RGB-a, respectively.\n\n\f6\n\nA.

ZAHB level\nTo convert the fiducial ridge lines into the absolute plane,\nwe need to assume a distance modulus and a reddening correction. In the following, we adopt the distance\nscale presented by Ferraro et al. (1999), which is based\non the comparison between the actual level of the Zero\nAge Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and the theoretical models computed by Straniero, Chieffi & Limongi (1997). By\nusing the optical photometric catalog partially published\nby Pancino et al. (2000) and following the prescriptions\nof Ferraro et al. (1999), we obtain for \u03c9 Cen VZAHB =\n14.55 \u00b1 0.09. Assuming a metallicity of [F e/H] = \u22121.6\nfor the main population (see above) and following eq. [4]\nby Ferraro et al. (1999), we obtain MVZAHB = 0.56 \u00b1 0.09.\nAdopting E(B\u2212V ) = 0.11\u00b10.01 (Lub, 2002), the distance\nmodulus finally turns out to be (m \u2212 M )0 = 13.65 \u00b1 0.13,\nin nice agreement with the most recent determinations\nby Thompson et al. (2001) and Caputo, Degl'Innocenti &\nMarconi (2002).\n\n3.3. Comparison with the F00 sample\nThe ridge lines of Tables 3 and 4 have been transformed\nto the absolute planes MK ,(J \u2212 K)0 and MK ,(V \u2212 K)0 ,\nusing the distance modulus and the reddening discussed\nabove, and assuming AJ = 0.87 E(B \u2212 V ) and AK = 0.38\nE(B \u2212 V ) extinction coefficients in the J and K bands,\n\nrespectively (Savage & Mathis,1979). Figure 6 compares\nthe ridge lines of \u03c9 Cen with the lines of a few globular\nclusters belonging to the sample presented by F00.\nIn both planes the RGB-MP ridge line is located between the metal-poor clusters M 68 ([F e/H] \u223c \u22121.99) and\nM 4 ([F e/H] \u223c \u22121.19), close to M55 ([F e/H] \u223c \u22121.61) as\nexpected, given its metallicity. The RGB-a is located between the metal-rich clusters 47 Tuc ([F e/H] \u223c \u22120.7) and\nNGC 6528 ([F e/H] \u223c \u22120.38), in good agreement with the\nspectroscopic constrains.\n\n4. RGB colors and morphology\nIn order to quantitatively describe the morphology and\nproperties of the RGBs of the different populations in \u03c9\nCen, we measured the full set of photometric parameters\ndefined by F00.\nThe main RGB observables measured in the IR CMDs\nare the following:\n\u2013 The RGB (J \u2212 K)0 and (V \u2212 K)0 colors at different\nmagnitude levels;\n\u2013 The RGB MK magnitude at fixed colors;\n\u2013 The RGB slope.\nIn Tables 5 and 6, the inferred (J \u2212 K)0 and (V \u2212 K)0\ncolors at fixed MK magnitudes are listed. Our results are\nin good agreement with the empirical relations proposed\nby F00 in both colors and magnitudes, the (J \u2212 K)0 colors\nof the RGB-a ridge line being only slightly redder than\npredicted, but still within the overall uncertainties.\n\n\fA.

In figure 9\nthe dependence of these two parameters on global metallicity is shown; the measurements taken on the RGB-MP\n\n7\n\nFig. 10.

At (V \u2212 K)0 = 3, we observe a nice agreement\nbetween the magnitudes measured for both the RGB-MP\nand RGB-a populations and the relations proposed by\nF00. At (J \u2212 K)0 = 0.7, the absolute MK magnitudes observed for the two RGB populations of \u03c9 Cen are instead\nclearly underestimated. This discrepancy can be due to\nuncertaintes in the reddening assumptions: in fact errors\nof a few hundredths of magnitude produce uncertainties\nof about 0.2-0.3 in K, depending on the RGB region intercepted.\nTo further describe the properties of the RGBs of\n\u03c9 Cen, we have measured the RGB slope, adopting the\ntechnique described by Kuchinski et al. (1995) and using\nthe RGB samples described in Section 3 and shown in\nFigure 5. Following the prescriptions by Kuchinski et al.\n(1995), only the brightest portion of the RGB (\u223c1 mag\nabove the HB level) has been considered in the fit. As\nalready emphasized by F00, although linear fits are not\nthe best representation of the RGB shape, the measurement of the RGB slope is still important since it represents a distance and reddening independent parameter to\ndescribe the RGB morphology. The inferred slopes for the\nRGB-MP and the RGB-a are consistent, within the uncertainties, with those of clusters of similar metal content\n(see Figure 10). The adopted absolute MK magnitudes at\n(V \u2212 K)0 = 3 and (J \u2212 K)0 = 0.7 and the slopes of the\nRGB for the two main populations of \u03c9 Cen are listed in\nTables 7.\n\n\f8\n\nA.

We find a good consistency between\nthe data and the empirical relation of F00.\n\n5.

The Theoretical Plane\nThe transformation of the RGB observed colors and\nmagnitudes into the theoretical plane (MBol , log Te ) has\nbeen performed using the bolometric corrections and\ntemperature scale for Population II giants computed by\nMontegriffo et al. (1998). In Figure 11 the fiducial lines\n\nIn order to enlarge our sample, both in size and in covered area, we correlated our catalog with that obtained\nin the external region of the cluster by the 2MASS survey, which extends to a very wide area of 3\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 . Using\n1,419 common stars, we verified the absence of any significant magnitude offset (see Section 2), hence we constructed an extended catalog where our magnitudes were\nmaintained in the overlapping regions, while in the outer\nregions (r > 6\u2032 ) the 2MASS catalog objects were added.\nWe thus obtained J and K magnitudes for a global sample of more than 120,000 stars, that allowed us to identify\nwith good accuracy one of the most subtle features along\nthe RGB: the RGB bump (Iben 1968).\nThe identification of the RGB bump is not an easy\ntask because of the need of large observational samples\n(Crocker & Rood 1984, Fusi Pecci et al. 1990). Moreover,\nsince in metal poor clusters the RGB bump occurs at\nbrighter luminosities, in a region that is intrinsically\n\n\fA. Sollima et al.: IR photometric properties of Red Giants in \u03c9 Cen\n\npoorly populated, its identification is even more difficult.\nTo correctly locate the bump we used both the cumulative and differential RGB luminosity functions (LF), by\ndetecting the slope variation in the former and identifying the corresponding peak in the latter (Fusi Pecci et al.\n1990). We identified the RGB-MP bump with good accuracy both in the K-band and in the V-band (using the optical catalogue by Pancino et al. 2000) at the observed magnitudes VBump = 14.40 \u00b1 0.05 and KBump = 11.76 \u00b1 0.05.\nThe absolute values turn out to be MVBump = 0.41 \u00b1 0.14\nBump\nand MK\n= \u22121.93 \u00b1 0.14, with the adopted distance\nmodulus and reddening corrections.\nOur detection of the RGB bump is illustrated in\nFigure 13, where the LF of the RGB-MP in the K band\nis shown as a smoothed histogram. In Figure 14 the absolute K magnitude of the bump is compared with the\nempirical F00 relation and with the theoretical models by\nStraniero, Chieffi & Limongi (1997). The location of the\nRGB-MP bump is in reasonable agreement with the predictions of both relations. However, the shape of the bump\non the differential LF appears widened, as can be expected\ndue to a possible residual contamination of RGB-MInt\nstars in our RGB-MP sample. To test this hypothesis, we\nhave compared in Figure 13 the position of the RGB-MP\nbump with the bump position computed for the blue side\nof the RGB-MP and the red side of the RGB-MP, separately. As expected, the red side bump appears shifted to\nfainter magnitudes while the blue side bump appears less\nwidened and slightly shifted towards brighter magnitudes.\nThe presence of multiple bumps at different magnitudes\nfor different sub-samples of the RGB has been shown also\nby Rey et al. (2003, see their Figure 10), in agreement\nwith what found here.\n\n9\n\nFig. 14.

Conclusion\nWe presented an extensive near IR, J and K catalog of\nstars in the giant globular cluster \u03c9 Cen. More than 73,000\nstars have been measured allowing an accurate photometric characterization of the RGB. In particular, the colors at\ndifferent magnitude levels, the magnitude at different colors, the RGB slope and the RGB bump position have been\nmeasured, scaled to the absolute plane and compared to\nsimilar features measured in clusters with different metallicity by F00. The agreement with the F00 relations is\nquite good, and the photometric properties of the newly\ndiscovered anomalous RGB (RGB-a) consistently reflect\nthe high metal content of this sub-population found by\nprevious spectroscopic work.\nAcknowledgements.
