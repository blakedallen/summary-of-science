The highest measured values\nexceed 250 kHz, demonstrating strong coupling of optical and mechanical modes in such structures.\nPACS numbers: 42.70.Qs, 43.40.Dx\n\nCavity optomechanics [1] exploits the coupling of mechanical oscillators to the light field via radiation pressure. On the applied side, such coupling may be used to\nenable novel radiation pressure driven clocks [2], make\nhighly sensitive displacement sensors, tunable optical filters [3], delay lines [4] or enable photon storage on a\nchip [5, 6]. On a fundamental level, such systems can\nbe exploited for demonstrating that nano- and micromechanical oscillators can exhibit quantum mechanical behavior [7]. It has been shown experimentally that it\nis possible to cool a mechanical oscillator intrinsically\nvia radiation pressure dynamical backaction [8]. In order to reach the ground state of mechanical motion and\nenable manipulation in the quantum regime, one approach consists in down-sizing the oscillator, thus shifting the quantum-classical transition towards higher temperatures. Among various sub-micron optomechanical\nsystems presently investigated [9], suspended membranes\ncontaining a photonic crystal cavity offer strong light confinement in diffraction-limited volumes and are therefore\nnatural candidates for achieving strong optomechanical\ncoupling. Recently, optomechanical coupling in 1D photonic crystal systems [10] has been observed in patterned\nsingle [11] and dual nanobeams (zipper cavities) [12, 13].\nIt would be highly desirable to extend such optomechanical coupling to 2D systems, notably photonic crystal\ndefect cavities. Such cavities offer the strong light confinement possible (i.e. small mode volume), high quality\nfactor (Q) [14] and have been used for studying cavity\nQED using quantum dots [15] or for realizing nanolasers\n[16, 17]. Recently, a 2D optomechanical photonic crystal slot cavity has been reported [18]. While mechanical\ndisplacement due to strong radiation force generated by\nband-edge modes in bilayer photonic crystal slabs has\nbeen reported as well [19], to date optomechanical coupling of the 2D conventional defect cavity has not been\nstudied.\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate optomechanical coupling\nusing a photonic crystal defect (L3) cavity. We provide a\ndirect and robust experimental determination of the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate [30] using frequency\nmodulation, showing a particularly strong coupling for\nthe localized mechanical modes, which may also be coupled to quantum dots in future studies [20].\n\nFIG. 1.

(d) Experimental setup (ECDL: External cavity diode laser, OI: Optical Isolator, EOM: Electrooptical modulator, FPC: Fiber polarization controller, PhC:\nPhotonic crystal defect cavity, PD: Photo diode).\n\nThe optomechanical device under study consists of\na 262-nm thick InP suspended membrane containing a\ntwo-dimensional photonic crystal defect cavity shown in\nFigure 1(a). The cavity, following the design proposed\nin [14], contains three missing holes in a line of a perfect\n\n\f2\ntriangular lattice of holes with a lattice constant of\na = 430 nm and a radius r = 90 nm. At both edges of\nthe cavity the holes are displaced outwards by d = 0.18a,\nin order to obtain high optical quality factors. The\ncavity is fabricated using electron beam lithography,\ninductively coupled plasma etching [21], and wet etching.\nThe cavity incorporates a single layer of self-assembled\nInAsP quantum dots [22] at its vertical center plane for\ncavity characterization. The whole structure is grown by\nmetalo-organic chemical vapor deposition. The quantum\ndot density is \u223c15\u00d7109 cm\u22122 , and their spontaneous\nemission is centered around 1560 nm at 300 K with\nan inhomogeneous broadening of about 150 nm. The\npresence of the dots inside the cavity allows to identify\nthe spectral properties of the fundamental optical mode\nof the cavity by photoluminescence measurements [23],\nas shown in Figure 1(b). The resonance wavelength of\nthe fundamental mode is centered around 1555 nm and\nthe cold-cavity quality factor is measured to be \u223c104\n(cavity linewidth is \u03ba/2\u03c0 \u2248 20 GHz). The suspended\nphotonic crystal membrane lies on top of a 10 \u03bcm high\nmesa structure (see Fig. 1(a)). The mesa structure is\nprocessed to enable positioning of a tapered optical fiber\nin the evanescent field of the cavity, while precluding any\ninteraction with the nearby substrate. The shape of the\nmembrane resembles a Bezier curve, which was chosen to\nincrease optomechanical coupling to the flexural modes.\nThe setup used in the experiment is depicted in Figure\n1(d). An external-cavity diode laser is used for the readout of the mechanical motion. Coupling to the optical\nmodes of the suspended membrane is achieved with the\noptical fiber-taper technique [24]. Piezoelectric actuators\nenable an accurate positioning allowing to optimize the\ngap between the fiber-taper and the defect cavity, and\nthus to increase evanescent coupling. Despite careful reduction of the taper-cavity gap, only a small fraction of\nthe light can be coupled into the defect cavity, typically\nnot exceeding 10 % of the incoming laser power. The\ncavity-fiber system is kept in a vacuum chamber with a\npressure below 1 mbar. Laser light coupled inside the\nphotonic crystal cavity leads to local heating, which induces a thermal effect arising from the temperature dependent refractive index n [25]. As dn/dT > 0 (T is the\ntemperature) for InP [26], the region detuned to the blue\nside of the resonance allows thermal passive locking [25].\nIn our experiments the laser frequency is chosen to correspond to the blue-detuned side of the fringe of the optical\nmode requiring no further locking. Mechanical motion of\nthe membrane is imprinted on the transmitted optical\nintensity through modulation of the internal cavity field.\nAn electro-optical modulator is used for frequency modulation to determine the optomechanical coupling rate.\nThe transmitted signal is detected by a fast receiver and\nthe electrical signal is analyzed with an oscilloscope as\nwell as an electronic spectrum analyzer, which is used\n\nfor the spectral analysis.\n\nFIG. 2.

The red curve represents a spectrum acquired with\nthe laser being detuned out of resonance.

(b) Spatial displacement pattern\nof the first eight mechanical modes and the prominent mode\naround 150 MHz, as obtained from finite element modeling.\n\nFor a launched laser power of 1.3 mW more than 20\nmechanical modes are observed in the frequency range\nbetween 10 MHz and 1 GHz. These modes can be separated into two mode families. The first family consists of\nflexural modes present in the low-frequency range (below\n200 MHz), whereas the second family consists of localized modes. Flexural modes, whose spectrum is shown\nin Figure 2(a), correspond to the movement of the whole\nmembrane. In order to identify the various modes, we\nmodeled the mechanical properties of the photonic crystal slab structure by finite element modeling (COMSOL\nMultiphysics). Realistic geometry parameters were taken\ninto account, including the under-etching of the mesa\nstructures between which the membrane is suspended.\nA good agreement between measurements and modeling\nis obtained using a Young modulus of 20 GPa (slightly\nsmaller than usual values observed in bulk InP materials\n[27]attributed to the perforation for the photonic crystal).

(c) Simulated (blue) and experimentally\ndetermined (red) progression of the resonance frequency of\nthe localized modes versus mode number (mode #22 was determined in a separate measurement).\n\nchanical displacement of the membrane localized in the\ncavity core of the defect. We were able to resolve the\nfundamental localized mode at 0.46 GHz as well as the\nthree higher mode orders (at 0.72 GHz, 0.99 GHz and\n1.26 GHz). The inset of Figure 3(a) compares the simulated against the measured resonance frequencies of the\nmechanical modes that could be assigned, revealing excellent agreement both for flexural and localized modes.\nThe progression of the resonance frequency of the localized modes versus mode number is shown in Figure 3(c)\nand follows a linear behavior with mode number.\nImportantly, localized mechanical modes coincide spatially fully with the optical defect cavity mode. Therefore, the photonic crystal not only offers strong optical\nconfinement, but simultaneously ultra-high phonon confinement. We note that the localization occurs in the\nabsence of a phononic band gap [28]. Due to the colocalization of the optical and mechanical mode within\nthe defect cavity, strong optomechanical coupling is expected. This is visualized in Figure 4(a), where the re-\n\nsults of the mechanical FEM simulation for the third order localized mode are compared with the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field of the optical defect mode, which was obtained through a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The high overlap\nof the mechanical displacement with the distribution of\nelectromagnetic energy promises strong optomechanical\ncoupling. In a second experiment we determined the coupling rate for various flexural modes and the second and\nthird order localized modes.\nUsually, the optomechanical coupling strength is determined by two parameters - the optomechanical couc\npling parameter G = d\u03c9\ndx , with \u03c9c being the resonance\nfrequency of the optical resonator and x denoting the displacement of the mechanical oscillator, and the effective\nmass meff [29] of the mechanical mode. The necessity of\nintroducing the effective mass routinely arises from the\narbitrary definition of x, which often cannot be consistent with the displacement pattern of different mechanical modes of the system. Particularly for photonic crystals it is difficult to define an unambiguous displacement\ndirection of a mechanical mode. One attempt to circumvent this problem is to introduce an effective length Leff\ndetermined by a perturbative expression of the overlap\nof mechanical displacement and the electromagnetic field\ndistribution [12, 13]. Recently, it was suggested that the\nvacuum optomechanical coupling rate g0 would be a more\nproper quantity for optomechanical systems [30, 31]. In\nanalogy to cavity Quantum Electrodynamics\n(cQED), g0\np\nis defined as g0 = G * xzpf , with xzpf = ~/2meff \u03a9m being the zero-point-fluctuations of the mechanical oscillator (~ indicates the reduced Planck constant and \u03a9m /2\u03c0\nthe mechanical resonance frequency). As all relevant op-\n\n\f4\ntomechanical parameters can be derived through knowledge of g0 , acquiring its value would make the determination of G and meff redundant. As described in [30],\nthe value g0 can be determined experimentally via\nr\ng0 =\n\nS\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m )\n\n\u0393m\n,\n4n\u0304\n\n(1)\n\nwith n\u0304 being the average phonon occupancy of the\nmechanical mode, \u0393m /2\u03c0 being the mechanical damping\nrate and S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m ) being the frequency spectral density\nof cavity frequency noise evaluated at the mechanical resonance frequency. For high phonon occupancy one can\napproximate n\u0304 \u2248 kB T /~\u03a9m \u001d 1, with kB as Boltzmann's\nconstant. S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m ) can be experimentally determined by\na frequency modulation technique [32].\nWe performed a measurement of the cavity frequency\nnoise by applying a known phase modulation to the laser\nusing an LiNbO3 electro-optical modulator (cf. Figure\n1). The incoming laser power was reduced to 0.9 mW.\nTo make sure that the mechanical modes were not driven\nthermally, the laser frequency was slightly detuned from\nthe side of the fringe in both directions just before the\nexperiment. With no change in the resonance frequency\nof the mechanical mode occurring, we inferred that the\nmechanical modes were only driven by thermal Brownian motion (T =300 K). The modulation frequency was\nchosen to be close to the resonance frequency of the mechanical mode to be calibrated. The measurement also\nallows calibration of the frequency noise produced by the\nmechanical mode. A detailed account of the calibration\nmethod is given in [33]. A calibrated frequency noise\nspectrum for the fundamental flexural mode is shown in\nthe inset of Figure 2(a), and the optomechanical vacuum\ncoupling rate was determined to be g0 /2\u03c0 = 234 Hz.\nThe mechanical quality factor for this mode is Qm = 890\nbeing the highest for all flexural modes. The coupling\nrate for the flexural modes increases with the mode number up to several kHz. The optomechanical coupling for\nthe localized mechanical modes was determined to be\ng0 /2\u03c0 = 199 kHz (Qm = 160) and g0 /2\u03c0 = 268 kHz\n(Qm = 180) for the second and third order, respectively.\nA calibrated frequency noise spectrum for third order localized mode is shown in Figure 4(b). The high values of\ng0 /2\u03c0 give a definite experimental proof of the high optomechanical coupling between a photonic crystal defect\ncavity and a localized mechanical mode. These coupling\nvalues are two orders of magnitudes higher than measured in whispering gallery mode toroidal resonators [34]\nand doubly-clamped strained silicon nitride beams in the\nnear-field of a silica toroidal resonator [9], both of which\nare ca. g0 /2\u03c0 \u2248 1 kHz. Moreover, the measured values\nare as high as the recently reported coupling of a flexural\nmode to a photonic crystal slot cavity [4]. The values of\ng0 /2\u03c0 which could be unambiguously obtained are specified in Table I.\n\nTABLE I.

The method does not\nrequire knowledge about the optical linewidth, the specific transduction mechanism of the signal through the\noptical cavity, the spatial distribution of electromagnetic\nenergy or the displacement pattern of the mechanical\nmode. Thus the method is particularly suitable for\noptomechanical calibration in photonic crystals due\nto the frequently complex spatial distribution of both\nmechanical and optical modes. Moreover, the present\nplanar architecture can be used for photon-phonon\nconversion experiments [4].\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated optomechanical coupling in a two-dimensional III-V photonic crystal defect\ncavity. We observed both flexural as well as localized\nmechanical modes. Furthermore, we provide direct measurements of the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate\nin a photonic crystal and measure for the first time the\ncoupling of a localized photonic crystal defect mode with\na localized 2D mechanical mode. Coupling rates for the\nlocalized modes exceed 250 kHz and are two orders of\nmagnitude larger than in conventional optomechanical\nsystems. By integrating a single quantum dot in the defect cavity, a variety of experiments can be envisioned\nsuch as laser cooling [20] and coupling of a quantum mechanical oscillator to an artificial atom, once the ground\nstate of the mechanical oscillator is reached.\nFunding for this work was provided by European\nNanoSci-ERA project NanoEPR, through QNEMS and\nMINOS by the FP7, the NCCR Quantum Photonics,\nthe SNF and through an ERC Starting Grant SiMP.\n\n\u2217\n\ntobias.kippenberg@epfl.ch\nisabelle.robert@lpn.cnrs.fr\n[1] T.

An electrooptical modulator (EOM) is used to phase modulate the laser carrier before its coupling into the cavity. The modulated\nphase \u03a6 of the signal can be written as\n\u03a6(t) = \u03c90 t + \u03b2 cos(\u03a9mod t),\n\n(S 1)\n\nwith \u03c90 as the radial laser frequency, t as the time, \u03b2 as the phase shift factor and \u03a9mod /2\u03c0 as the modulation\nfrequency. The transduced signal from the photonic crystal cavity is detected with a fast receiver and the spectrum is\nresolved with an electrical spectrum analyzer (ESA). The spectrum exhibits the Lorentzian spectra of the mechanical\nmodes and a calibration peak at \u03a9mod /2\u03c0 resulting from the modulation [1, 2]. If the modulation frequency is chosen\nto be close (a couple of mechanical linewidths) to the resonance frequency \u03a9m /2\u03c0 of the mechanical mode to be\ncalibrated, g0 can be determined as [3]\ng02 \u2248\n\nS\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m )\n1 \u03b2 2 \u03a92mod \u0393m\n,\n2n\u0304\n2\n4 * RBW S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod )\n\n(S 2)\n\nwith n\u0304 as the average phonon occupancy, \u0393m /2\u03c0 as the dissipation rate of the mechanical oscillator, RBW as the\nresolution bandwidth of the ESA, S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m ) as the double-sided frequency spectral noise density evaluated at the\nmechanical resonance frequency and S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod ) as the double-sided frequency noise spectral density evaluated at the\nmodulation frequency. Only the proportion between S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m ) and S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod ) is required to be known, and it can\nbe readily obtained from the measured peak power spectral density values of the mechanical and calibration signals.\nThe power spectral density is usually given in dBm in the spectrum of the ESA. The proportion can be found with\nthe following relationship\nS\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9m ) = S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod ) * 10\u2212(Pmod \u2212Pm )/10 ,\n\n(S 3)\n\nwith Pmod being the power at the peak of the calibration signal expressed in dBm and Pm being the power at the\npeak of the mechanical mode, which is expressed in dBm as well.\nThe frequency modulation technique can be also used to calibrate the spectrum in absolute units. This is done by\ndirectly determining S\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod ) via [3]\n2\n\nS\u03c9\u03c9 (\u03a9mod ) =\n\n(\u03b2\u03a9mod )\n.\n4 * RBW\n\n(S 4)\n\nBy using an equivalent scheme depicted in Equation S 3, the spectrum can be calibrated. The calibration holds true\nas long as the frequencies of the values to be calibrated are close enough to the resonance frequency of the calibration\npeak. Otherwise, a generalized transduction coefficient needs to be included [3].\n\nCALCULATION OF CORRECTION FACTORS FOR THE ESA SPECTRUM\n\nWhen measuring electrical signals with an ESA, one usually expresses the power detected at a certain frequency in\nthe logarithmic units of dBm. By averaging one obtains an average of the logarithmic power, which is not equal to the\nlogarithmic expression of the averaged power - the value that is of significance in the measurements. The discrepancy\nis different for random signal, such as background noise and the mechanical spectrum (resulting from thermal motion),\nand for coherent signals, such as a calibration peak with a large enough signal-to-noise ratio. For random signals it\nis known [4] that the measured value is about 2.5 dB below the actual one, whereas for truly coherent sources the\nmeasured signal corresponds to the real one. For signals that have contributions both from a coherent source and\n\n\f7\nrandom signals, such as a calibration peak with a rather low signal-to-noise ratio, the correction factor depends on\nthe magnitude of both contributions.\nModern ESAs can often compensate this discrepancy internally, however as this function was not applied during\nour measurements, we need to use the correction described above. In the following we will derive the general\nexpression for the correction of the measured signal.\nA signal arriving on the ESA can be decomposed in its in-phase (I) and out-of-phase (Q) part. Spectrum analyzers\nrespond to the magnitude of the signal within their RBW passband [4]. The magnitude of a signal (voltage) v\nrepresented by I and Q is given by\np\n(S 5)\nv = I 2 + Q2 .\nThe average power arriving on the detector is given by\n\u001c 2\u001d \u001c 2\n\u001d\nv\nI + Q2\nP\u0304 =\n=\n,\n50\n50\n\n(S 6)\n\nwhere an input impedance of 50 \u03a9 is considered (equations are generally dimensionless in this section) and the\nbrackets hi imply that the mean value is taken of the expression inside them. In the average mode the ESA averages\nthe logarithmic input signal, thus leading to the following expression for the measured power\n\u001c\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u001d\nI + Q2\nP\u0304meas = 10 * log\n.\n(S 7)\n50\nThe logarithmic value of the actual power of the signal is given by\n\u0001\nP\u0304log = 10 * log P\u0304\n\n(S 8)\n\nIt should be intuitive that the values for P\u0304log and P\u0304meas are not equal, just as the log of the average is not the same\nas the average of the log.\nThe mean values given in Equations S 6 and S 7 can be determined by multiplying the variable being measured\nwith its probability density function (PDF) and integrating over the possible values of the variable. The PDFs of the\nquadratures I and Q can be assumed to be Gaussian with a certain variance \u03c3I for I and \u03c3Q for Q, and a certain\noffset of the distribution from 0 being \u03bcI for I and \u03bcQ for Q. In general, one can assume the variance to be the same\nfor both quadratures, so that \u03c3I = \u03c3Q = \u03c3. For random signals it holds that \u03bcI = \u03bcQ = 0, whereas for a coherent\nsignal one has \u03bcQ = 0, but \u03bcI = \u03bc > 0.\nUsing the assumptions stated above, one can write\n2\n\n1\n(I \u2212 \u03bc)\nPDF (I) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\n!\n(S 9)\n\nand\nPDF (Q) = \u221a\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ2\n1\nexp \u2212 2 .\n2\u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\n(S 10)\n\nFrom the Equations S 6 and S 7 it is obvious that we are interested in the mean values of v 2 . This requires one\nto find the PDFs for this variable from the PDFs of I and Q. This is accomplished by using a general relationship,\nwhich links the PDFs fXi (xi ) of independent random variables Xi , i = 1, 2, ...n to the PDF fY (y) of some variable\nY = G (X1 , X2 , ...Xn ). This relationship is given by\nZ \u221eZ \u221e Z \u221e\nfY (y) =\n...\ndx1 dx2 ...dxn fX1 (x1 ) fX2 (x2 ) ...fXn (xn ) \u03b4 (t \u2212 G (x1 , x2 , ...xn )) ,\n(S 11)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03b4 denotes Dirac's delta function.\n\n\f8\nUsing Equation S 11 one can determine the PDF of v 2 to be\n\nPDF v\n\nwith J0\n\n\u0010\n\nv2 \u03bc\n\u03c32\n\n\u0011\n\n2\n\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0010 v\u03bc \u0011\nv + \u03bc2\n1\nexp\n\u2212\n*\nJ\n,\n=\n0\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c3 2\n\u03c32\n\n\u0001\n\n(S 12)\n\nas a Bessel function of the first kind.\n\nUsing this expressions for the PDF of v 2 , one can calculate P\u0304 and P\u0304meas by using Equations S 6 and S 7.

This means that for a strong coherent\ndrive there is no discrepancy between the measured and the real one.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. S1. Reflection coefficient \u0393EOM of the power being received by the combined EOM+cable system versus frequency\nmeasured with a network analyzer.\n\nFIG. S2. Transmission coefficient TBN C of the power being transmitted through the BNC cable linking the signal generator\nand the EOM versus frequency. The measurement was performed with a network analyzer.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe phase shift factor \u03b2 can be determined by\n\u03b2 = V /V\u03c0 * \u03c0 =\n\np\n\n2Prf Z\u03c0/V\u03c0 ,\n\n(S 18)\n\nwith V as the applied voltage, V\u03c0 as the voltage needed to induce a phase shift of \u03c0, Prf as the input power of\nthe signal generator providing the modulation signal and Z as the impedance between the signal generator and the\nEOM. To have a quantitavie understanding of the actual voltage applied on the EOM, we directly measured the\nreflectance of the system consisting of the EOM and the BNC cable linking it to the signal generator. Moreover, we\nmeasured transmittance through the BNC cable to account for potential losses. The measurements were performed\nusing a network analyzer. Figure S1 shows the fraction of the reflected power \u0393EOM of the combined EOM+cable\nsystem as a function of the output frequency of the signal generator. Figure S2 shows the fraction of transmitted\npower TBN C through cable as a function of frequency. It is obvious that for high frequencies the power loss becomes\nfairly strong, which is due to radiation losses in the BNC cable. This fact is undermined by Figure S2 showing the\nreflection coefficient \u0393BN C through the cable, which is well below the one of the total EOM+cable system.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. S3. Reflection coefficient \u0393BN C of the power being transmitted through the BNC cable linking the signal generator and\nthe EOM versus frequency. The measurement was performed with a network analyzer.\n\nThe factor \u03b2 can be thus determined as\nq\n\u0001\n\u03b2 = 2Prf * 1 \u2212 10\u0393EOM /10 * 10TBN C /10 * Zout \u03c0/V\u03c0 .\n\n(S 19)\n\nMeasurements gave a value of V\u03c0 \u2248 7 V which is consistent with the value provided of the manufacturer of the\nEOM.\nA spectrum of the fundamental flexural mode is shown in Figure S4 together with the calibration peak. As discussed\nin the previous section, the measured spectrum needs to be readjusted. This is done by first fitting the mechanical\nwith a Lorentzian and the calibration peak with a Gaussian. The noise level is obtained from the baseline of the\nLorentzian, and this value is subsequently used to determine the variance \u03c3 as defined in Equations S 9 and S 10\nthrough use of Equation S 15. From the Gaussian fit we obtain the maximum value of the calibration peak. Using\nthis value together with the determined value of \u03c3, one can numerically solve Equation S 14 to obtain \u03bc. The value\nof \u03bc2 /50 is the corrected maximum value of the calibration peak. The spectrum of the random signals, consisting\nof the background noise and the mechanical response, is corrected with the constant value given in Equation S 17.\nThe corrected values for the maxima of the mechanical spectrum and the calibration peak are used together with\n\u0393m , inferred from the Lorentzian fit, to determine g0 as described in Equation S 2. By using Equation S 4 one can\ncalibrate the spectrum in absolute frequency units.\nThe values of g0 /2\u03c0, that could be unambiguously determined, are summarized in Table S1. The value of g0 /2\u03c0\nwithout the correction for logarithmic averaging is also stated together with the calculated correction for the calibration\npeak. The required correction for the calibration peak is fairly small for most measurements due to the large enough\nsignal-to-noise ratio.
