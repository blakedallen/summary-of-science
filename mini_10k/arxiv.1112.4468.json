At a first glance, the former expectation, which is\nbased on the observation that pairing affects not all but only\na small fraction (|\u2206|/\u03b5F )N of fermions, seems more intuitive. However, this subject has recently regained interest in condensed-matter and atomic and molecular physics\ncommunities due to its relevance to the possible px + ipy superconducting phase of Sr2 RuO4 [2] and atomic chiral pwave superfluids [3], respectively, supporting for the latter expectation [4, 5]. On one hand, these recent results seem intuitive at least in the strong fermion attraction limit of tightlybound p-wave Cooper molecules, where all of the molecules\ncan undergo BEC at zero temperature with each molecule having a microscopic angular momentum ~. On the other hand,\nthey seem counterintuitive in the weak fermion attraction\nlimit of loosely bound and largely overlapping p-wave Cooper\npairs, since these results imply that the angular momentum\nin the BCS ground state is macroscopically different from its\nvanishing value in the normal ground state, when the pairing energy becomes arbitrarily small. While this controversy\nstill awaits for an experimental resolution, here we propose an\nalternative atomic system where the microscopic angular momentum of Cooper pairs can also give rise to a macroscopic\none. With their unique advantages over the condensed-matter\nsystems, it is plausible that the macroscopic angular momentum of this alternative system may be observed for the first\ntime with cold atoms, and that this would also shed some\nlight on the 3 He controversy for which the basic mechanism\nis found to be similar.\nCold atom systems have already proved to be versatile in\nsimulating various many-body problems. For instance, one\n\nof the major achievements with atomic Fermi gases in the\npast decade is the unprecedented realization of the BCS-BEC\ncrossover [6], where the ground state of the system can be\ncontinuously tuned from the BCS to the BEC limit as a function of increasing fermion attraction with the turn of a knob.\nThe main difference between the BCS-BEC crossover and the\nBCS theory is that the Cooper pairing is allowed not only for\nfermions with energies close to the Fermi energy but also for\nall pairs with appropriate momenta [1, 6]. Having established\nthe basic tools, it is arguable that one of the most promising\nresearch directions to pursue with cold Fermi gases is the artificial spin-orbit gauge fields. Such a field has already been\nrealized with cold Bose gases [7, 8] using a novel technique\nbased on spatially-dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, and the same technique is equally applicable for neutral fermionic atoms. In fact, we have recently\nlearned that the first generation of quantum degenerate spinorbit coupled Fermi gases has recently been created with 40 K\natoms [9].\nThis immediate possibility of creating a spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas has already received tremendous theoretical\ninterest in condensed-matter and atomic physics communities, exploring a number of exotic superfluid phases with balanced or imbalanced populations, at zero or finite temperatures, in two or three dimensions, etc. [10\u201323]. Motivated by\nthese recent advances, here we study ground-state and finitetemperature phases of trapped spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases,\nand our main results are as follows. We find that the presence\nof a spin-orbit coupling (SOC) spontaneously induces counterflowing \u2191 and \u2193 mass currents in the vicinity of the trap\nedge [24]. We show that these currents flow even in noninteracting systems, and that they are quite robust against the\neffects of asymmetric SOC in x and y directions, gradually\nreducing to zero as the SOC becomes one dimensional. However, their strength decreases toward the molecular BEC limit,\nwhich can be achieved either by increasing the SOC or the interaction strength. We argue that the origin of spontaneously\ninduced counterflowing mass currents in spin-orbit coupled\nFermi gases can be understood via a direct correspondence\nwith the chiral p-wave superfluids/superconductors, however,\n\n\f2\nwith some fundamental differences in between.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,\nfirst we introduce the mean-field Hamiltonian that is used to\ndescribe the spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases on optical lattices,\nand then use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism to\nobtain the generalized self-consistency equations for the number of fermions, superfluid order parameter, and strength of\ncirculating mass currents. The numerical solutions of this formalism are presented in Sec. III, which is followed by a brief\ndiscussion on their experimental realization in Sec. IV. We\nsummarize our main findings in V.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nIn this paper, we consider a harmonically trapped twodimensional optical lattice in the presence of a non-Abelian\ngauge potential. In addition to the usual spin-conserving hopping terms, the main effect of such a gauge potential is the\nappearance of an additional spin-flipping hopping term in the\nsingle-particle kinetic energy term as discussed next.\n\nA.

For a generic gauge field A =\n(\u03b1\u03c3y , \u2212\u03b2\u03c3x ), where \u03c3e is the Pauli matrix and {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2265 0 are\nindependent parameters characterizing both the strength and\nthe symmetry of the spin-orbit coupling, the \u2191 and \u2193 fermions\ngain \u03c6i+x\u0302,i = e\u2212i\u03b1\u03c3y phase factors for hopping in the positive x direction and \u03c6i+\u0177,i = ei\u03b2\u03c3x phase factors for hopping\nin the positive y direction. Note that the spin-conserving and\nspin-flipping hopping terms are proportional, respectively, to\ncos \u03b1 and sin \u03b1 in the x direction, and to cos \u03b2 and sin \u03b2 in\nthe y direction. The off-diagonal coupling \u2206i is the meanfield superfluid order parameter to be specified below, and\nH\nV\u03c3i\n= gn\u2212\u03c3i is the Hartree term where g \u2265 0 is the strength\nof the onsite attractive interaction and n\u03c3i is the filling of \u03c3\nfermions at site i. Here, (\u2212 \u2191) =\u2193 and vice versa. We introduce \u03c3-dependent chemical potentials \u03bc\u03c3 to fix the number of \u03c3 fermions independently, but we assume both \u2191 and\n\u2193 fermions feel the same trapping potential ViT = V0 ri2 /2,\n\nwhere the distance ri is measured from the center in our L\u00d7L\nlattice.

While the off-diagonal couplings are \u2206ij = \u2206i \u03b4ij diagonal in site indices since we\nconsider onsite interactions only, the nearest-neighbor hopping and onsite energy terms can be written compactly as\nij\nij\nH\nT\nT\u03c3\u03c3\n\u2032 = \u2212t\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 (\u03bc\u03c3 + V\u03c3i \u2212 Vi )\u03b4ij \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 , where \u03b4ij is the\nKronecker delta.

For instance, in this paper we are interested in the\n\n\f3\nquantum mechanical probability-current (mass- or particley\nx\ncurrent) of \u03c3 fermions at site i defined by J\u03c3i = J\u03c3i\nx\u0302 + J\u03c3i\n\u0177,\ne\ni,i+\u00ea \u2020\nwhere J\u03c3i = \u2212it\u03c3\u03c3 hc\u03c3i c\u03c3,i+\u00ea \u2212H.c.i is the eth component.\nUsing the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation, we obtain\nXh\ne\nJ\u03c3i\n= \u2212iti,i+\u00ea\n(u\u03c3ni )\u2217 u\u03c3n,i+\u00ea f (\u03b5n )\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\n(a)\n\nn\n\ni\n\u03c3 \u2217 \u03c3\n+ (vni\n) vn,i+\u00ea f (\u2212\u03b5n ) \u2212 H.c. , (5)\nwhere we set the lattice spacing and ~ to unity. In our twodimensional system, we expect mass currents to circulate\naround the central site, so that J\u03c3i = J\u03c3i \u03b8\u0302, where \u03b8 is the\nazimuthal angle. In addition, the local angular-momentum associated with such a circulating mass current is in the z direction, and its magnitude at a particular site i is simply related to\ny\nx\nthe local mass current by Lz\u03c3i = xi J\u03c3i\n\u2212 yi J\u03c3i\n, where xi and\nyi are the coordinates of site i with respect to the center, i.e.\nminimum of the trapping potential. In this paper, we are interested in the total absolute angular\nP momentum per \u03c3 particle\nwhich is given by Lz\u03c3 = (1/N\u03c3 ) i ri |J\u03c3i |.\nHaving established the BdG formalism, now we are ready\nto present our numerical solutions for the ground-state and\nfinite-temperature phases, which are obtained by solving\nEqs. (2- 4) in a self-consistent manner.\n\nIII.\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nOur numerical calculations are performed on a twodimensional square lattice with L = 48 lattice sites in each\ndirection. We take V0 \u2248 0.014t as the strength of the trapping potential, and discuss both symmetric (\u03b1 = \u03b2) and\nasymmetric (\u03b1 6= \u03b2) SOC fields. Since we are mainly interested in the low-filling population-balanced systems, we set\nN\u2191 = N\u2193 = 125, and study the resultant phases as a function\nof g, \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, we briefly comment on the effects\nof high filling and population imbalance on the ground-state\nphases toward the end of this section.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the strength of the \u2191 mass current J\u2191i at\nzero temperature (T = 0) for noninteracting (g = 0) systems\nwith symmetric and asymmetric SOC, where we set \u03b1 = \u03c0/4\nand vary \u03b2 parameter. We use Fig. 1(a) as our reference data\nin all of our discussions below. First of all, the coarse-grained\ndata near the trap center is a finite-size lattice effect and it\ndoes not affect our main findings. In addition, due to the\ntime-reversal symmetry, J\u2193i has exactly the opposite circulation for population-balanced systems and this current is not\nshown throughout this paper. As \u03b2 decreases from the symmetric case with \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 to \u03b2 = 0, the asymmetry between x\nand y directions increase in such a way that the spin-flipping\nhopping gradually decreases to zero in the y direction, and the\nSOC field eventually becomes purely one dimensional in the\nx direction. We find that the mass current flows as long as\nthe SOC field has both x and y components, and its strength\ndecreases gradually as a function of increasing the asymmetry\nof SOC fields. Note that since the asymmetric SOC breaks the\nC4 symmetry of the square lattice, the resultant mass currents\n\n-0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The strength of the \u2191 mass current J\u2191i (in\nunits of t) is shown as a function of lattice coordinates xi and yi at\nzero temperature (T = 0) for noninteracting systems (g = 0). Here,\nwe consider (a) a symmetric SOC where we set \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03c0/4,\nand (b-c) asymmetric SOCs where we set \u03b2 to \u03c0/8 in (b) and \u03c0/16\nin (c), while keeping \u03b1 = \u03c0/4.

In addition, we see that the gas expands a little bit with increasing\nasymmetry, which is due to the decrease in density of singleparticle states.\ny\nIn Fig. 2, we show the mass current J\u2191i\nand filling n\u2191i of\n\u2191 fermions at T = 0 for noninteracting systems with varying symmetric SOC strengths \u03b1 = \u03b2. We find that J\u2191i first\nincreases and then decreases as \u03b1 = \u03b2 is increased from 0\nto \u03c0/2. It is expected that the strength of the mass current\nrapidly increases as a function of increasing spin-flipping hopping with respect to the spin-conserving ones, since the presence of a nonzero SOC is what allowed the mass current to\nform in the first place. However, as the SOC terms dominate, the chemical potential gradually drops below the band\nminimum, and then the system gradually crosses over to the\n\n\f4\n0.015\n\n0.42\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nn\u2191i\n\nJ\u2191iy\n\n0.28\n0\n\n0.14\n\u03c0/4\n5\u03c0/16\n7\u03c0/16\n\n-0.015\n-20\n\n0\nxi\n\n0\n-20\n\n20\n\n0\nxi\n\n20\n\ny\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) The strength of the \u2191 mass current J\u2191i\n(in\nunits of t), and (b) the filling of \u2191 fermions n\u2191i are shown at T = 0\nas a function of xi , when yi = 0.

It is clearly seen that increasing the g has qualitatively the same effect on the ground-state\nphases as increasing the SOC. For instance, we find that the\nmass current first increases and then decreases as a function\nof increasing g. In addition, the gas shrinks with increasing g,\ndue to the formation of more tightly-bound Cooper pairs.

We note that in contrast to the no-SOC\ncase where the formation of a two-body bound state between\n\u2191 and \u2193 fermions requires a finite interaction threshold in a\ntwo-dimensional lattice, here it can form even for arbitrarily\nsmall interactions simply by increasing the SOC, due to the\nincreased single-particle density of states. Therefore, it is expected that the rapid increase in the strength of the mass current is followed by a gradual decrease at larger SOC, and that\nthe mass current eventually vanishes at sufficiently large SOC.\nIn addition, we see that the gas shrinks with increasing SOC,\nwhich is again due to the increased density of states. Note that\nthe ratio between the trapping potential and the effective hopping terms also increases as \u03b1 = \u03b2 increases from 0 to \u03c0/2.\nWe also calculate the absolute angular momentum per particle\nLz\u03c3 and find approximately 0.53, 0.56 and 0.38 (in units of ~),\nwhen \u03b1 = \u03b2 is set to \u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/16 and 7\u03c0/16, respectively.\n\nJ\u2191iy\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.1\n\n-0.015\n\nT =0\n0.14t\n0.35t\n-20\n\n0\nxi\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n0\nxi\n\n20\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) (a) The strength of the \u2191 mass current J\u2191i (in\nunits of t), and (b) the filling of \u2191 fermions n\u2191i are shown at finite T\nas a function of xi , when yi = 0.

Since finite\ntemperature excites more and more particles to higher oscillator states as a function of increasing T , and this naturally\nleads to an increase in the system size, and decrease in the\nstrength of the mass currents. This is clearly seen in the figy\nure, where the peak value of J\u2191i\nreduces approximately to half\nof its T = 0 value when T \u2243 0.14t, but with a larger width.\nWe calculate the absolute angular momentum per particle Lz\u03c3\nand find approximately 0.53, 0.33 and 0.16 (in units of ~),\nwhen T is set to 0, 0.14t and 0.35t, respectively. Therefore,\nLz\u03c3 decreases significantly from its ground-state value \u2248 0.5\nas the temperature increases.\nSo far we only discussed population-balanced systems with\na low filling at the trap center, i.e. n\u03c3i . 0.4, and here we\nbriefly comment on the effects of high filling and population imbalance on the ground-state phases [25]. First of all,\ndue to the particle-hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian around\nn\u03c3i = 0.5, in addition to the mass-current peak circulating\nin the vicinity of the trap edge, an additional peak that is circulating mostly near the trap center is induced when the trap\n\n\f5\ncenter is close to a band insulator, i.e. n\u03c3i \u2243 1. Therefore,\nmass currents show a double-ring structure in high-filling lattice systems. Second, the strengths of mass currents are quite\nrobust against the effects of imbalanced populations. For instance, when the total number of \u2193 fermions is reduced from\nN\u2193 = 125 in Fig. 1(a) to N\u2193 = 20 while keeping N\u2191 = 125\nfixed, so that n\u2191 \u2248 0.3 and n\u2193 \u2248 0.05 at the trap center, the\nmaximum currents J\u2191 & J\u2193 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 t occur about the\nsame radial distance as the population-balanced case shown\nin Fig. 1(a).\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving established the qualitative behavior of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass currents in spin-orbit\ncoupled Fermi gases, next we argue that the origin of these\ncurrents can be understood via a direct correspondence with\nthe chiral p-wave superfluids/superconductors.\n\nA. Correspondence with chiral p-wave systems\n\nThe origin of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass\ncurrents near the trap edge can be understood via a direct correspondence with the px + ipy -superfluids/superconductors,\ne.g. A phase of liquid 3 He, for which it is known that a spontaneous mass current also flows near the boundary [4, 5]. In\nthese p-wave systems, the mass current and hence the macroscopic angular momentum is associated with the chirality of\nCooper pairs. The chirality can be most easily seen by noting\nthat the chiral p-wave order parameter \u2206k \u221d (x\u0302 \u00b1 i\u0177) * k,\nwhere k is the relative momentum of a Cooper pair, is an\neigenfunction of the orbital angular momentum with eigenvalue \u00b1~. This mechanism explains our findings since it can\nbe shown that the order parameter of spin-orbit coupled Fermi\ngases with Rashba-type SOC and s-wave contact interactions\nhas chiral p-wave symmetry. To see this one needs to transform the Hamiltonian to the helicity basis, i.e. the pseudospin is no longer a good quantum number in the presence of\na SOC, and the spin direction is either parallel or anti-parallel\nto the direction of in-plane momentum in the \u00b1 helicity basis.\nIn the helicity-basis representation, it becomes clear that only\nintraband Cooper pairing occurs between fermions with same\nhelicity, and that the order parameter for \u00b1 helicity pairing has\npx \u2213 ipy symmetry [12].\nAlthough the basic mechanism in chiral p-wave systems\nand spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases share some similarities\nwith respect to spontaneously induced edge currents, they also\ndiffer in fundamental ways. For instance, in contrast to the\nchiral p-wave systems where the formation of Cooper pairs\nand hence the mass current requires an interacting system,\nin spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases currents flow even in the\nabsence of interactions. In addition, the chiral p-wave systems belong to the topological class of integer quantum Hall\nsystems, and since these systems both break time-reversal\nsymmetry, they exhibit spontaneous edge currents circulating along a particular direction. However, spin-orbit coupled\n\nFermi gases preserve time-reversal symmetry just like quantum spin Hall systems, and therefore, they both exhibit spontaneously induced counterflowing \u2191 and \u2193 edge currents. Next,\nwe comment on the experimental realization of spontaneously\ninduced edge currents in atomic systems.\n\nB. Experimental realization\n\nIn comparison to bulk (center) effects, there is no doubt that\nthe edge effects are more difficult to observe in trapped atomic\nsystems. This is because as the local density decreases from\nthe central region to the edges, it gets harder to probe local\nproperties. In addition, the local critical superfluid temperature eventually drops below the temperature of the system near\nthe edges, and the superfluidity is also lost starting from the\nedges inwards. One way to partially overcome such problems\ncould be to load the optical lattice potential with higher particle fillings such that the trap center is close to a band insulator,\ni.e. unit filling. In this case, an additional mass-current peak\ncirculates mostly near the trap center (see above), and such a\nlocal current could be easier to probe with current experimental capabilities.\nThe measurement of the angular momentum of rotating\natomic systems have so far only been achieved indirectly, by\nobserving the shift of the radial quadrupole modes. While this\ntechnique was initially used for rotating atomic BECs [26, 27],\nit has recently been applied to the rotating fermionic superfluids in the BCS-BEC crossover [28]. We believe a similar technique could be used for measuring the intrinsic angular momentum of spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases, which may\nprovide an indirect evidence for counterflowing mass currents.\nIn addition, we note that a realistic scheme has recently been\nproposed to detect topological edge states in an optical lattice\nunder a synthetic magnetic field [29]. This proposal is based\non a generalization of Bragg spectroscopy that is sensitive to\nangular momentum.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nTo conclude, we showed that the presence of a Rashba-type\nSOC spontaneously induces counterflowing \u2191 and \u2193 mass currents. While these currents have a single peak that is circulating mostly near the trap edge in low-filling lattice systems,\nan additional peak that is circulating mostly near the trap center is also induced in high-filling lattice systems, exhibiting a\ndouble-ring structure. We note that our results for the lowfilling lattice systems are directly applicable to the dilute systems (without the optical lattice potential), for which we expect qualitatively similar behavior. These currents flow even\nin noninteracting systems, and they are quite robust against\nthe effects of imbalanced populations and/or asymmetric SOC\nin x and y directions. However, their strength decreases toward the molecular BEC limit, which can be achieved either\nby increasing the SOC or the interaction strength. We argued\nthat the origin of spontaneously induced counterflowing mass\ncurrents in spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases can be understood\n\n\f6\nvia a direct correspondence with the chiral p-wave superfluids/superconductors, however, with some fundamental differences in between.\n\nNo. 3501-110T839, and T\u00dcBA-GEB\u0130P.
