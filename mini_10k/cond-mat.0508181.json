Many interesting and fundamental\nphenomena, such as the spin Hall effect3,4,5,6 and the spin precession7,8 in systems with\nspin-orbit coupling, have been discovered and are under further study.\nAs for the charge current, the definition of the local charge current density ~je (r, t) =\nRe[\u03a8\u2020 (r, t)e~v\u03a8(r, t)] and its continuity equation\n\nd e\n\u03c1 (r, t)\ndt\n\n+ \u2207 \u2022 ~je (r, t) = 0 is well-known\n\nin physics. Here \u03a8(r, t) is the electronic wave function, ~v = \u1e59 is the velocity operator, and\n\u03c1e (r, t) = e\u03a8\u2020 \u03a8 is the charge density. This continuity equation is the consequence of charge\ninvariance, i.e. when an electron moves from one place to another, its charge remains the\nsame. However, in the spin transport, there are still a lot of debates over what is the correct\ndefinition for spin current.9 The problem stems from that the spin ~s is no invariant quantity\nin the spin transport, so that the conventional defining of the spin current < ~v~s > is no\nconservative. Recently, some studies have begun investigation in this direction10,11,12 , e.g. a\nsemi-classical description of the spin continuity equation has been proposed10,11 , as well as\nstudies introducing a conserved spin current under special circumstances.9\nIn this paper, we study the definition of local spin current density. We find that due to\nthe spin is vector and it has the translational and rotational motion, one has to use two\nquantities, the linear spin current and the angular spin current, to completely describe the\nspin transport. Here the linear spin current describe the translational motion of a spin, and\nthe angular spin current is for the rotational motion. The conventional linear spin current\nhas been extensively studied. However, the physical meaning of the angular spin current\nis given for the first time. The definition of two spin current densities are given and they\nappear naturally in the quantum spin continuity equation. Moreover, we predict that the\nangular spin current can generate an electric field similar as with the linear spin current,\nand thus contains physical consequences.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we first discuss the flow of a classical\nvector. The flow of a quantum spin is investigated in Section III. In Section IV, we study\nthe problem of electric fields induced by spin currents. Finally, a brief summary is given in\nSection V.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE FLOW OF A CLASSICAL VECTOR\n\nBefore studying the spin current in a quantum system, we first consider the classical\ncase. Consider a classical particle having a vector m\n~ (e.g. the classical magnetic moment,\netc.) with its magnitude |m|\n~ fixed under the particle motion. To completely describe this\n~ (r, t) = \u03c1(r, t)m(r,\nvector flow (see Fig.1c), besides the local vector density M\n~\nt) one needs\ntwo quantities: the linear velocity ~v(r, t) and the angular velocity \u03c9\n~ (r, t). Here \u03c1(r, t) is the\nparticle density, and ~v and \u03c9\n~ describe the translational and rotational motions, respectively\n(see Fig.1a and b). In contrast with the flow of a scalar quantity in which one only needs\none quantity, namely the local velocity ~v (r, t), to describe the translational motion, it is\nessential to use two quantities, ~v (r, t) and ~\u03c9 (r, t), for the vector flow. We emphasize that\nit is impossible to use one vector to describe both translational and rotational motions\naltogether.\n~\nSince |m|\n~ is a constant, the change of the local vector M(r,\nt) in the volume element\n\u2206V = \u2206x\u2206y\u2206z with the time from t to t + dt can be obtained (see Fig.1c):\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX \u0014 \u2206V\n\u2206V\n~\n~\n~\nd M (r, t)\u2206V =\nvi (r, t)dtM(r, t) \u2212\nvi (r + \u2206\u00ee, t)dtM (r + \u2206\u00ee, t)\n\u2206i\n\u2206i\ni=x,y,z\n~\n+~\u03c9 (r, t) \u00d7 M(r,\nt)\u2206V dt.\n\n(1)\n\nThe first and the second terms on the right describe the classical vector flowing in or out the\nvolume element \u2206V and its rotational motion respectively, and both can cause a change in\nthe local vector density. When \u2206V goes to zero, we have the vector continuity equation:13\nd ~\n~\n~ (r, t),\nM (r, t) = \u2212\u2207 \u2022 ~v (r, t)M(r,\nt) + ~\u03c9 (r, t) \u00d7 M\ndt\n\n(2)\n\n~ is a tensor, and its element (~v M)\n~ ij = vi Mj . Notice that this continuity equation is\nwhere ~v M\nfrom the kinematics and the invariance of |m|,\n~ in particular it is independent of the dynamic\n\nlaws.14 This is completely same with the continuity equation with a scalar quantity (e.g.\n~ (r, t) and ~j\u03c9 (r, t) = ~\u03c9 (r, t) \u00d7 M\n~ (r, t), then Eq.(2)\ncharge). Introducing js (r, t) = ~v(r, t)M\nreduces to:\nd ~\nM (r, t) = \u2212\u2207 \u2022 js (r, t) + ~j\u03c9 (r, t).\ndt\n\n(3)\n\n~ is from the translational motion of the classical vector m,\n~\nHere js = ~vM\n~ and ~j\u03c9 = \u03c9\n~ \u00d7M\n\ndescribes its rotational motion.13 Since ~v and ~\u03c9 are called as the linear velocity and the\n3\n\n\fangular velocity respectively, it is natural to name js and ~j\u03c9 as the linear and the angular\ncurrent densities.\nIn order to describe a scalar (e.g. charge) flow, one local current ~je (r, t) is sufficient.\nWhy is it required to introduce two quantities instead of one to describe a vector flow?\nThe reason is that the scalar quantity only has the translational motion, but the vector\nquantity has two kinds of motion, the translational and the rotational. So one has to use\ntwo quantities, the velocity ~v and the angular velocity ~\u03c9 , to describe the motion of a single\n~ and ~j\u03c9 = ~\u03c9 \u00d7 M\n~ are necessary to describe\nvector. Correspondingly, two quantities js = ~v M\nthe vector flow.\nIn the steady state case, the scalar (e.g. charge) continuity equation reduces into \u2207 \u2022~je =\n\n0, so the scalar current ~je is a conserved quantity. But for a vector flow, the linear vector\ncurrent js is not conserved since \u2207 \u2022 js = ~j\u03c9 . Whether it is possible to have a conserved\n\nvector current through redefinition? Of course, this redefined vector current should have\na clear physical meaning and is measurable. In our opinion, this is almost impossible in\nthe 3-dimensional space. The reasons are: (i) One can not use a 3-dimensional vector to\ncombine both ~v and ~\u03c9 . Therefore one can also not use a 3-dimensional tensor to combine\n~ and ~j\u03c9 = ~\u03c9 \u00d7 M\n~ . (ii) Consider an example, as shown in Fig.3a, a oneboth js = ~vM\ndimensional classical vector flowing along the x-axis. When x < 0, the vector's direction is\nin +x axis. At 0 < x < L, the vector rotates in accompany with its translational motion.\nWhen x > L, its direction is along +y axis. Since for x < 0 and x > L the vector has\nno rotational motion, the definition of the vector current is unambiguous, and the non-zero\nelement is jxx for x < 0, and jxy for x > L. Therefore, the vector current is obviously\ndifferent for x < 0 and x > L, and the vector current is non-conservative.\n~ and ~j\u03c9 = ~\u03c9 \u00d7 M\n~ already have clear physical meanings. They\nIn our opinion, js = ~v M\nalso completely and sufficiently describe a vector flow. One may not need need to enforce\na conserved current. In particular, as shown in the example of Fig.3a, sometimes it is\nimpossible to introduce a conserved current.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE FLOW OF A QUANTUM SPIN\n\nNow we study the electronic spin ~s in the quantum case. Consider an arbitrary wave function \u03a8(r, t). The local spin density ~s at the position r and time t is: ~s(r, t) = \u03a8\u2020 (r, t)~s\u02c6\u03a8(r, t),\n4\n\n\f\u02c6 with ~\u03c3\n\u02c6 being the Pauli matrices.

In some previous works, this\nequation has also been obtained in the semiclassical case.10,11 Here we emphasize that this\nspin continuity equation (10) is the consequence of invariance of the spin magnitude |~s|,\ni.e. when an electron makes a motion, either translation or rotation, its spin magnitude\n|~s| =\n\n~\n2\n\nremains a constant. And the Eq.(10) should be independent with the force (i.e.\n\nthe potential) and the torque, as well the the dynamic law. The two quantities js (r, t) and\n~j\u03c9 (r, t) in Eq.(10), which are defined in Eqs.(12,13) respectively, describe the translational\nand rotational motion (precession) of a spin at the location r and the time t. They will\nbe named the linear and the angular spin current densities accordingly18 , similar as ~v and\n~\u03c9 are called the linear and the angular velocities. In fact, the linear spin current js (r, t) is\nidentical with the conventional spin current investigated in recent studies19 . However, we\ngive the physical meaning of ~j\u03c9 (r, t) for the first time.\nNext, we discuss certain properties of js (r, t) and ~j\u03c9 (r, t). Notice that ~j\u03c9 (r, t) which\ndescribe the rotational motion (precession) of the spin plays a parallel role in comparison\nwith the conventional linear spin current js (r, t) for the spin transport. (1) In similar with the\nclassical case, it is necessary to introduce the two quantities js (r, t) and ~j\u03c9 (r, t) to completely\ndescribe the motion of a quantum spin. (2) The linear spin current is a tensor. Its element,\ne.g. js,xy , represents an electron moving along the x direction with its spin in the y direction\n(see Fig.2a). The angular spin current ~j\u03c9 is a vector. In Fig.2b, its element j\u03c9,x describes\nthe rotational motion of the spin in the y direction and the angular velocity \u03c9\n~ in the \u2212z\ndirection. (3) From the linear spin current density js (r, t), one can calculate (or say how\nRR\n~ \u2022 js .\nmuch) the linear spin current I~s flowing through a surface S (see Fig.2d): I~sS = S dS\nHowever, the behavior for the angular spin current is different. From the density ~j\u03c9 (r, t), it\n\nis meaningless to determine how much the angular spin current flowing through a surface\nS, because the angular spin current describes the rotational motion not the movement. On\nthe other hand, one can calculate the total angular spin current I~\u03c9V in a volume V from\nRRR\n~j (r, t)dV . (4) It is easy to prove that the spin currents in the present\n~j\u03c9 : I~\u03c9V =\nV \u03c9\ndefinitions of Eqs.(12,13) are invariant under a space coordinate transformation as well the\n\ngauge transformation. (5) If the system is in a steady state, js and ~j\u03c9 are independent of\nthe time t, and\n\nd\n~s(r, t)\ndt\n\n= 0. Then the spin continuity equation (10) reduces to: \u2207 \u2022 js = ~j\u03c9\n6\n\n\for\n\nH\n\nS\n\n~ \u2022 js =\ndS\n\nRRR\n\nV\n\n~j\u03c9 dV . This means that the total linear spin current flowing out of a\n\nclosed surface is equal to the total angular spin current enclosed. If to further consider a\n\u2032\nquasi one dimensional (1D) system (see Fig.2d), then one has I~sS \u2212 I~sS = I~\u03c9V . (6) The linear\nspin current density js = Re{\u03a8\u2020~v~s\u02c6\u03a8} gives both the spin direction and the direction of spin\nmovement, so it completely describes the translational motion. However, the angular spin\n\u02c6\ncurrent density, ~j\u03c9 = Re{\u03a8\u2020 ddt~s \u03a8} = Re{\u03a8\u2020 ~\u03c9 \u00d7 ~s\u02c6\u03a8} involves the vector product of \u03c9\n~ \u00d7 ~s\u02c6,\nnot the tensor ~\u03c9~s\u02c6. Is it correct or sufficient to describe the rotational motion? For example,\nthe rotational motion of Fig.2b with the spin ~s in the y direction and the angular velocity\n~\u03c9 in the \u2212z direction is different from the one in Fig.2c in which ~s is in the z direction\nand \u03c9\n~ is in the y direction, but their angular spin currents are completely the same. Shall\nwe distinguish them? It turns out that the physical results produced by the above two\nrotational motions (Fig.2b and 2c) are indeed the same. For instance, the induced electric\nfield by them is identical since a spin ~s has only the direction but no size (see detail discussion\nbelow). Thus, the vector ~j\u03c9 is sufficient to describe the rotational motion, and no tensor is\nnecessary.\nNow we give an example of applying the above formulas, Eqs.(12,13), to calculate the spin\ncurrents. Let us consider a quasi 1D quantum wire having the Rashba spin orbit coupling,\nand its Hamiltonian is:\n2\n\u03c3z\n~2 k R\np~2\n+ V (y, z) + [\u03b1(x)px + px \u03b1(x)] +\n,\nH=\n2m\n2~\n2m\n\n(14)\n\nwhere kR (x) \u2261 \u03b1(x)m/~2 . \u03b1(x) = 0 for x < 0 and x > L, and \u03b1(x) 6= 0 while 0 < x < L.\n\nThe other Rashba term \u2212 \u03b1~ \u03c3x pz is neglected because z-direction is quantized7 . Let \u03a8 be a\nstationary wave function\n\u03a8(r) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212i\n\nRx\n\nkR (x)dx\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2 ikx \uf8ed e\n\uf8f8 \u03c6(y, z),\ne\nRx\n2\nei 0 kR (x)dx\n0\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c6(y, z) is the bound state wave function in the confined y and z directions. \u03a8(r)\nrepresents the spin motion as shown in Fig.3a, in which the spin moves along the x axis,\nas well the spin precession in the x-y plane in the region 0 < x < L.7,8 Using Eqs.(12,13),\nthe spin current densities of the wave function \u03a8(r) are easily obtained. There are only two\n\n7\n\n\fnon-zero elements of js (r):\n~2 k\n|\u03c6(y, z)|2 cos 2\u03c6(x),\n2m\n~2 k\n|\u03c6(y, z)|2 sin 2\u03c6(x).\njsxy (r) =\n2m\n\njsxx (r) =\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nThe non-zero elements of ~j\u03c9 (r) are:\n~2 kkR (x)\n|\u03c6(y, z)|2 sin 2\u03c6(x),\nm\n~2 kkR\n|\u03c6(y, z)|2 cos 2\u03c6(x),\nj\u03c9y (r) =\nm\n\nj\u03c9x (r) = \u2212\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) =\n\nRx\n0\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nkR (x)dx. Those spin current densities confirm with the intuitive picture\n\nof an electron motion, precession in the x-y plane in 0 < x < L and movement in the x\ndirection (see Fig.3a).\nIn particular, in the region of x < 0 and x > L, \u03b1(x) = kR (x) = 0, and \u03c3\u0302 is a good\nquantum number, hence, ~j\u03c9 = 0. In this case, the definition of the spin current js is\nunambiguous. However, the spin currents are different in x < 0 and x > L except for\n\u03c6(L) = n\u03c0 (n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12 ...). This is clearly seen from Fig.3a. Therefore, through this\nexample, one can conclude that it is sometimes impossible to define a conserved spin current.\nThe example of Fig.3a indeed exists and has been studied before7,8 .\nAbove discussion shows that the linear spin current js = ~v~s and the angular spin current\n~j\u03c9 = ~\u03c9 \u00d7 ~s have clear physical meanings, representing the translational motion and the\nrotational motion (precession) respectively. They completely describe the flow of a quantum\nspin. Any physical effects of the spin currents, such as the induced electric field, can be\nexpressed by js and ~j\u03c9 .20\n\nIV.\n\nSPIN CURRENTS INDUCED ELECTRIC FIELDS\n\nRecently, theoretic studies have suggested that the (linear) spin current can induce an\n~ 21,22,23 . Can the angular spin current also induce an electric field? If so this\nelectric field E\ngives a way of detecting the angular spin current. Following, we study this question by\nusing the method of equivalent magnetic charge24 . Let us consider a steady-state angular\nspin current element ~j\u03c9 dV at the origin. Associated with the spin ~s, there is a magnetic\nmoment (MM) m\n~ = g\u03bcB ~\u03c3 =\n\n2g\u03bcB\n~s\n~\n\nwhere \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. Thus, corresponding\n8\n\n\fto ~j\u03c9 , there is also a angular MM current ~jm\u03c9 dV =\n\n2g\u03bcB ~\nj\u03c9 dV\n~\n\n. From above discussions, we\n\nalready know that ~jm\u03c9 (or ~j\u03c9 ) comes from the rotational motion of a MM m\n~ (or ~s) (see Fig.2b\nand 2c), and ~jm\u03c9 = ~\u03c9 \u00d7 m\n~ (or ~j\u03c9 = \u03c9\n~ \u00d7~s). Under the method of equivalent magnetic charge,\nthe MM m\n~ is equivalent to two magnetic charges: one with magnetic charge +q located at\n\u03b4n\u0302m and the other with \u2212q at \u2212\u03b4n\u0302m (see Fig.2e). n\u0302m is the unit vector of m\n~ and \u03b4 is a tiny\n\nlength. The angular MM current ~jm\u03c9 is equivalent to two magnetic charge currents: one is\n~j+q = n\u0302j q\u03b4|~\u03c9 | sin \u03b8 at the location \u03b4n\u0302m , the other is ~j\u2212q = n\u0302j q\u03b4|~\u03c9| sin \u03b8 at \u2212\u03b4n\u0302m (see Fig.2e),\nwith n\u0302j being the unit vector of ~jm\u03c9 and \u03b8 the angle between ~\u03c9 and m.\n~ In our previous\nwork,23 we have given the formulae of the electric field induced by a magnetic charge current.\nThe electric field induced by ~jm\u03c9 dV can be calculated by adding the contributions from the\ntwo magnetic charge currents. Let \u03b4 \u2192 0, and note that 2q\u03b4 \u2192 |m|\n~ and |~\u03c9 ||m|\n~ sin \u03b8 = |~jm\u03c9 |,\n~ \u03c9 generated by an element of the angular spin current ~j\u03c9 dV :\nwe obtain the electric field E\nZ ~\nZ\n\u2212\u03bc\nj\ndV\n\u00d7\nr\n\u2212\u03bc\ng\u03bc\n0\nm\u03c9\n0\nB\n~\u03c9 =\n~j\u03c9 dV \u00d7 r\nE\n=\n(20)\n3\n4\u03c0\nr\nh\nr3\n\n~ s generated by an element of the linear spin current using\nWe also rewrite the electric field E\nthe tensor js :23\n~ s = \u2212\u03bc0 g\u03bcB \u2207 \u00d7\nE\nh\n\nZ\n\njs dV \u2022\n\nr\n,\nr3\n\n(21)\n\n~ \u03c9 decays as\nBelow we emphasize three points: (i) In the large r case, the electric field E\n~ s goes as 1/r 3.

However, for each E\nE\nE\nC\n\nC\n\n(iii) As mentioned above, a angular spin current ~j\u03c9 may consist of different \u03c9\n~ and ~s (see\n\nFig.2b and 2c). However, the resulting electric field only depends on ~j\u03c9 = \u03c9\n~ \u00d7 ~s. This is\nbecause a spin vector contains only a direction and a magnitude, but not a spatial size (i.e.\nthe distance \u03b4 approaches to zero). In the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, both magnetic charge currents ~j\u00b1q\nreduce to ~\u03c9 \u00d7 m/2\n~\nat the origin. Therefore, the overall effect of the rotational motion is\nonly related to ~\u03c9 \u00d7 m,\n~ not separately on ~\u03c9 and m.\n~ Hence it is enough to describe the spin\nrotational motion by using a vector ~\u03c9 \u00d7 ~s, instead of a tensor ~\u03c9~s.\nDue to the fact that the direction of ~s can change during the particle motion, the linear\nspin current density js is not a conserved quantity. It is always interesting to uncover a\n9\n\n\fconserved physical quantity from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Let us\napply \u2207\u2022 acting on two sides of Eq.(10), we have:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\n(\u2207 \u2022 ~s) + \u2207 \u2022 \u2207\u2032 \u2022 js \u2212 ~j\u03c9 = 0,\ndt\nwhere \u2207\u2032 \u2022 js means that \u2207\u2032 acts on the second index of js , i.e. (\u2207\u2032 \u2022 js )i =\n\ni, j \u2208 (x, y, z). Define ~j\u2207\u2022~s = \u2207\u2032 \u2022 js \u2212 ~j\u03c9 , the above equation reduces into:25\nd\n(\u2207 \u2022 ~s) + \u2207 \u2022 ~j\u2207\u2022~s = 0.\ndt\n\n(22)\nP\n\nd\nj dj js,ij\n\nwith\n\n(23)\n\nThis means that the current ~j\u2207\u2022~s of the spin divergence is a conserved quantity in the steady\nstate case. In fact, \u2212\u2207 \u2022 ~s(r, t) represents an equivalent magnetic charge, so ~j\u2207\u2022~s can also\nbe named the magnetic charge current density. Moreover, the total electric field produced\nby js and ~j\u03c9 can be rewritten as:\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\nr\n\u03bc0 g\u03bcB\n~\n~\n~\n\u2207\u2032 \u2022 js \u2212 ~j\u03c9 dV \u00d7 3\nET = Es + E\u03c9 =\nh\nr\nZ\nr\n\u03bc0 g\u03bcB ~\nj\u2207\u2022~s dV \u00d7 3 .\n=\nh\nr\n\n(24)\n\n~ T only depends on the current ~j\u2207\u2022~s of the spin divergence. Note\nSo the total electric field E\n~ T can be measured experimentally in principle.

It is independent of the external force F as well dynamic laws.\nIn other words, even if the acceleration a 6= F/m, the continuity equation still survives. It\nis complete same with the vector continuity equation (2) or (3). This equation is also from\nthe kinematics and the invariance of |m|.\n~ In particular, it is independent of the external force\nand the torque acting on the vector, as well as the dynamic laws. In other words, the vector\ncontinuity equation does not depend on the changes in the velocity and the angular velocity\nunder the actions of the forces and the torques.\n15\n\nNote that those results, Eqs.(10, 12, and 13), are valid in general. They are independent of\n~ the\nthe special choice of Hamiltonian (6). For example, in the case with a vector potential A,\n\u02c6 \u2022 [~\ngeneral spin-orbit coupling \u03b1~\u03c3\np \u00d7 \u2207V (r)], and so on, the results still hold.\n\n16\n\nE.I. Rashba, Fiz.

C 17, 6039 (1984).\n\n18\n\n~j\u03c9 is called the spin torque in the work10 in which the semi-classical approach to the spin\ncontinuity equation is discussed. Here we consider that ~j\u03c9 describes the rotational motion of a\nspin, thus named the angular spin current.\n\n19\n\nFrom js (r, t), the total linear spin current along i direction (i = x, y, z) is: I~si (i, t) =\n\nRR\n\ndS \u00ee \u2022\n\njs (r, t). To assume I~si (i, t) independent on t and i (e.g. in the case of the steady state and without\nRRR\nRRR\nRRR\nspin flip), one has: I~si = L1\ndV \u00ee \u2022 js (r, t) = L1\ndV Re\u03a8\u2020 v\u0302i~s\u02c6\u03a8 = L1\ndV \u03a8\u2020 12 (v\u0302i~s\u02c6 +\n\n~s\u02c6v\u0302i )\u03a8 =< 12 (v\u0302i~s\u02c6 + ~s\u02c6v\u0302i ) >, where L is sample length in i-direction. This definition is the same as\nin recent publications4 .\n20\n\nHere we consider another physical effect, the heat produced by the spin currents. Assume a uniform isotropic conductor having a linear spin current js and a charge current ~je , and considering\nthe simple case that there exists no spin flip process (i.e. ~s is conserved) so that ~j\u03c9 = 0. Then the\ni\nP 2\u03c1 h\n~jsi | + jei )2 + (|~jsi | \u2212 jei )2 =\nproduced heat Q in unit volume and in unit time is Q =\n(|\n4\ni=x,y,z\n!\nP 2\nP\nj + (jei )2 \u2261 \u03c1(j2s + ~je2 ), where \u03c1 is the resistivity. So the produced heat by the spin\n\u03c1\nij\n\ns,ij\n\ni\n\ncurrent can be expressed by js (for the case of ~j\u03c9 = 0). Note the produced heat Q depends on\n\nj2s , whereas the induced electric field depends on \u2207\u2032 \u2022 js \u2212 ~j\u03c9 .\n21\n\nJ.E. Hirsch, Phys. Rev.
