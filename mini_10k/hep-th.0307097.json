Since fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations are equivalent in SU(3), we have the option to define SU(Nc ) QCD keeping\nquarks in the latter. We can then define a new 1/Nc expansion (at fixed number of flavors Nf )\nthat shares appealing properties with the topological (fixed Nf /Nc ) expansion while being more\nsuitable for theoretical analysis. In particular, for Nf = 1, our large-Nc limit gives a theory that\nwe recently proved to be equivalent, in the bosonic sector, to N = 1 supersymmetric gluodynamics.\nUsing known properties of the latter, we derive several qualitative and semi-quantitative predictions\nfor Nf = 1 massless QCD that can be easily tested in lattice simulations. Finally, we comment on\npossible applications for pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and real QCD.\nPACS numbers: 11.15.Pg, 12.38.Aw, 12.38.Lg, 11.30.Pb\n\nVery few techniques are available for analytical studies of non-perturbative properties of non-supersymmetric\ngauge theories such as QCD. Among the most promising\nones, large-N expansions play a special role, in particular\nbecause of their conjectured connection to string theories.\nThe simplest and the oldest 1/Nc expansion in QCD is\nthat suggested by 't Hooft [1]. The 't Hooft limit assumes\nNc \u2192 \u221e while keeping the 't Hooft coupling g 2 Nc fixed.\nIf the number of quark flavors is fixed too (i.e. does\nnot scale with Nc ) then each quark loop is suppressed\nby 1/Nc . Only quenched planar diagrams survive in the\nleading order. Non-planar diagrams with \"handles\" are\nsuppressed by 1/Nc2 per handle. Thus, the corrections to\nthe leading approximation run in powers of (Nf /Nc ) and\n1/Nc2 . The 't Hooft expansion led to a number of notable\nsuccesses in such issues as the Zweig rule, the \u03b7 \u2032 mass\nformula (see below), and so on. Unfortunately, nobody\nsucceeded in fully solving QCD even to the leading order\nin the 't Hooft expansion.\nIn the range of questions where the quark loops are\nimportant, a better approximation is provided by the\ntopological expansion (TE) [2] in which Nf /Nc is kept\nfixed in the large-Nc limit, rather than Nf . Then, in the\nleading order, TE preserves all planar diagrams, including quark loops. This is easily seen by slightly modifying\n[2] the 't Hooft double-line notation - adding a flavor\nline to the single color line for quarks. In the leading\n(planar) diagrams the quark loops are \"empty\" inside,\nsince gluons do not attach to the flavor line. Needless to\nsay, obtaining analytic results in TE is even harder than\nin the 't Hooft case.\nIn this letter we propose a new large-Nc expansion that\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: adi.armoni@cern.ch\naddress: michael.shifman@cern.ch; Permanent address:\nWilliam I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA\n\u2021 Electronic address: gabriele.veneziano@cern.ch\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nshares some advantages of TE while retaining a significant predictive power. The results obtained in the new\nlarge-Nc limit are complementary to those derived in the\n't Hooft limit.\nOur basic idea is as follows. Let us start from Nc = 3\nQCD with Nf quark flavors, which may or may not be\nmassless. (For definiteness we will consider the massless\ncase.) The quark can be described by a Dirac field transforming in the fundamental representation of SU(3)color ,\nor, equivalently, in the two-index antisymmetric representation (plus their complex conjugates). In extrapolating from Nc = 3 to arbitrary Nc , the former alternative\nleads to the 't Hooft limit. We will explore the latter\nalternative, representing the quark of a given flavor by\na Dirac field in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Now, taking the limit Nc \u2192 \u221e at g 2 Nc and\nNf fixed does not decouple the quark loops since, for\nlarge Nc , the number of degrees of freedom in the antisymmetric field scales as Nc2 . This is the starting element\nof our new 1/Nc expansion. For reasons explained in [3],\nit will be referred to as the orientifold large-Nc limit. The\nleading order of this new expansion corresponds to the\nsum of all planar diagrams, in the same way as in TE,\nbut with the crucial difference that quark loops are now\n\"filled\", because the second line in the fermion propagator is now also a color line.\nThe orientifold large-Nc limit is, therefore, unquenched, and its 't Hooft diagrams look precisely as\nthose of QCD with Nf Majorana fields in the adjoint\nrepresentation, modulo reversal of some arrows in the\nfermion loops. Let us call the SU(Nc ) Yang\u2013Mills theory with Nf Majorana fields in the adjoint representation\nadjoint QCD. Trivially extending our original arguments\n[3], one can actually prove [4] that the orientifold largeNc limit of QCD is equivalent, in its bosonic sector, to\nthe adjoint QCD just mentioned. This can be shown to\nbe the case even in the presence of quark masses.\nAdjoint QCD can be seen, in turn, as a softly-broken\nversion of supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory (SYM)\n\n\f2\nwith Nf \u2212 1 additional adjoint chiral superfields. This\nclass of models is currently under intense scrutiny in connection with the works of Refs. [5, 6]. Soft-breaking mass\nterms are ascribed to the scalar fields, so that the scalar\nsector decouples. We will briefly comment on the Nf > 1\ncase later, focusing now on the particular case Nf = 1.\nOne-flavor QCD in the orientifold large-Nc limit becomes SU(Nc ) Yang\u2013Mills theory with one Dirac spinor\nin the antisymmetric representation. As was shown in\nRef. [3], this theory is planar-equivalent to adjoint QCD\nwith Nf = 1, which is nothing but SU(Nc ) super Yang\u2013\nMills theory. This result was a development of the previously formulated Strassler's conjecture [7] and studies\nof brane configurations of type 0 string theory [8]. The\nplanar equivalence between N = 1 SYM theory and orientifold field theories amounts to the following statement:\nthe SU(Nc ) gauge theory with two Weyl fermions in the\ntwo-index antisymmetric representation,\n+\n(i.e. one Dirac anti-symmetric fermion) at Nc \u2192\n\u221e is equivalent, in a bosonic subsector, to N =\n1 gluodynamics. Not only were the planar N = 1 SYM\ntheory and the planar orientifold field theory prove to be\nequivalent at the perturbative level: we argued that the\nfull (perturbative and non-perturbative) partition functions of the two theories become equivalent after integration over the respective fermions, at the planar level.\nIt is worth noting that the two theories are not fully\nidentical. In particular the color-singlet spectrum of the\norientifold theory consists only of bosons and does not\ninclude composite fermions at Nc \u2192 \u221e. Some consequences of the (partial) equivalence were discussed in detail in [3, 4].\nNow we will use the above planar equivalence to make\npredictions for one-flavor QCD, keeping in mind that\nthey are expected to be valid up to corrections of the order of 1/Nc = 1/3 (barring large numerical coefficients):\n(i) Confinement with a mass gap. Here we assume that\nlarge-Nc N = 1 gluodynamics is a confining theory with\na mass gap. Alternatively, if we start from the statement\nthat one-flavor QCD confines, we arrive at the statement\nthat so does N = 1 SYM theory, while the mass gaps are\ndynamically generated in both theories.\n(ii) Degeneracy in the color-singlet bosonic spectrum.\nEven/odd parity mesons (typically mixtures of fermionic\nand gluonic color-singlet states) are expected to be degenerate. In particular,\nm2\u03b7\u2032\n= 1 + O(1/Nc ) ,\nm2\u03c3\n\none-flavor QCD ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03c3 stand for 0\u2212 and 0+ mesons, respectively.\nThis follows from the exact degeneracy in N = 1 SYM\ntheory. Note that the \u03c3 meson is stable in this theory, as\nthere are no pions. The prediction (1) should be taken\nwith care, (i.e. a rather large numerical coefficient in\nfront of 1/Nc may occur), since the \u03b7 \u2032 mass is given by\n\nthe anomaly (the WV formula [9, 10]), whereas the \u03c3\nmass is more \"dynamical.\" The degeneracy among the\neven/odd parity mesons should improve at higher levels\nof the expected Regge trajectory.\n(iii) Bifermion condensate. N = 1 SU(Nc ) gluodynamics has a bifermion condensate [11] that can take Nc\ndistinct values:\n3 \u2212\u03c4 /Nc 2i\u03c0k/Nc\n= c\u039b3 ei(\u03b8+2\u03c0k)/Nc ,\ne\nh\u03bb\u03bbik \u223c Muv\ne\nk = 0, 1, . . . , Nc \u2212 1,\n(2)\n\nwith\n\u03c4=\n\n8\u03c0 2\n\u2212 i\u03b8\ng2\n\nand c a calculable numerical coefficient.

We expect, however, the absolute value\nof the condensate to be in reasonable agreement with the\nsupersymmetry-based prediction.\n(iv) The accuracy of \"dynamical\" predictions, namely\nthose results that are not saturated by one loop (i.e. the\nanomalies), can be inferred from perturbative arguments.\nIn one-flavor QCD the first coefficient of the \u03b2 function is\nb = 31/3, while in adjoint QCD with Nf = 1 it becomes\nb = 27/3.\nIn fact, in the very same approximation it can be asserted that the \u03b2 function of the one-flavor QCD should\ncoincide with the exact NSVZ beta function [12]:\n\u03b2=\u2212\n\n1\n9\u03b12\n.\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 3\u03b1/2\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nThus, for the (relative) value of the 2-loop \u03b2-function\ncoefficient, we predict +3\u03b1/2\u03c0, to be compared with the\nexact value in one-flavor QCD:\n+\n\n134 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2248 4.32\n.\n31 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\nNote that our 1/Nc expansion, unlike 't Hooft's, overemphasizes the quark-loop contributions, and thus makes\nthe theory less asymptotically free than in reality- the\nopposite of what happens in 't Hooft's expansion. Parametrically, the error in our way of treating one-flavor\nQCD is 1/Nc rather than 1/Nc2 . This is because there\nare Nc2 \u2212 1 gluons and Nc2 \u2212 Nc fermions in the orientifold field theory.\nNow we will comment on possible applications for the\npure SU(3) Yang\u2013Mills theory. As was explained, oneflavor QCD is approximated (to O(1/Nc )) by a supersymmetric theory. On the other hand, a different 1/Nc expansion - the 't Hooft one - connects one-flavor QCD\nto the pure SU(3) gauge theory. Therefore, the pure\nSU(3) theory is also approximated, in a sense, by a supersymmetric theory. Although we suspect that in this\ncase the two approximations accumulate, so that errors\nare large, it is reasonable to ask whether there are relics\nof SUSY in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.\nIn fact, it has been known for a long time [13] that such\nrelics do exist in pure gauge theory, although at that time\nthey were not interpreted in terms of supersymmetry. Indeed, it was shown [13] that one can use an approximate\nholomorphic formula\n4 \u2212\u03c4 /3\nhtr F 2 + i trF\u0303 F i = Muv\ne\n.\n\n(6)\n\n(For this equation to be holomorphic in \u03c4 ,\nrenormalization-group-invariant and, in addition, to\nhave the correct \u03b8 dependence, we must use b = 12\nrather than the actual value b = 11 in SU(3) Yang\u2013Mills\ntheory. The decomposition 11 = 12 \u2212 1 has a deep physical meaning: \u22121 presents a unitary contribution in the\none-loop \u03b2 function, while 12 is a bona fide antiscreening,\nsee e.g. [14]). The holomorphic dependence is a relic of\nsupersymmetry. Equation (6) implies, in particular, that\nthe topological susceptibility \u03c7 is expressible in terms of\nthe expectation value of tr F 2 :\n* \u221a\n+\n\u221a\nZ\n3 a a\n3 a a\n4\n12\u03c7 \u2261 \u2212i d x\nF F\u0303 (x) ,\nF F\u0303 (0)\n16\u03c0 2\n16\u03c0 2\nconn\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1 a a\nF F\n,\n(7)\n=\n8\u03c0 2\nThe numerical value of the left-hand side is known, either from the WV formula [9, 10] or from lattice measurements [15], to be \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 GeV4 . The gluon\ncondensate on the right-hand side is that of pure Yang\u2013\nMills theory and was estimated to be approximately twice\n\nlarger (see Ref. [13], Sect. 14) than the gluon condensate\nin actual QCD,\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1 a a\n\u2248 0.012 GeV4 ,\nF F\n4\u03c0 2\nQCD\nsee Ref. [16]. If so, the numerical value of the right-hand\nside is \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 GeV4 . Note that the phenomenological estimate of the gluon condensate and the factor 2\nenhancement mentioned above are valid up to \u223c 30%.\nFinally, we want to comment on real QCD. Let us assume for a moment that the \u03c3 mass is not very sensitive\nto the number of flavors. On the other hand, according\nto the WV formula [9, 10]\np and neglecting quark masses,\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 mass scales like Nf ; we can therefore extrapolate the relation (1) to obtain a prediction for real QCD\nm\u03b7 \u2032 \u223c\n\n\u221a\n3m\u03c3 .\n\n(8)\n\nAlthough \u03c3 is very broad in real QCD, it is amusing that\nthe above relation is indeed in qualitative agreement with\nthe position of the enhancement in the \u03c0\u03c0 channel.\nThe connection between three-flavor QCD and adjoint\nQCD with Nf = 3 can be used to relate the patterns of\nthe chiral symmetry breaking in these two theories, see\nRef. [4].\nIn 't Hooft's large Nc limit the width of q q\u0304 mesons\nscales as 1/Nc , as compared to 1/Nc2 for glueballs, i.e. the\nlatter are expected to be relatively more narrow. This is\nquite weird, given that no glueball was identified so far,\nin spite of decades of searches.\nOur Nc counting, instead, predicts that the widths\nof both quarkonic and gluonic mesons scale as 1/Nc2 .\nGiven that glueballs are expected to be heavier than their\nquark counterparts, this might explain why many narrow\nquarkonia have been found but no comparably-narrow\nglueballs.\nIn conclusion, we have argued that the orientifold theory generalization of QCD to arbitrary Nc can be used\n(through its SYM limit) in order to make predictions for\none-flavor QCD. Hopefully, these will be tested in lattice\nsimulations in the near future.\nNote added Meanwhile, the calculation of the quark\ncondensate in one-flavor QCD, starting from SUSY gluodynamics, as outlined in the text, has been completed\n[17] and has exhibited a remarkable agreement with the\ncurrently accepted \"phenomenological\" value.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank J.
