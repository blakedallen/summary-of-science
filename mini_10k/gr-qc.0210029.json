We are\nconcerned with noise in these measurements driven by the light itself. Since available mirrors invariably absorb a small amount of the light that strikes them, photon shot noise and\nother intensity variations in light beams cause measurement errors, as photons are randomly converted to heat at the mirror surface. Assuming the only intensity fluctuations in\nthe laser are from shot noise, photon-driven noise is believed to be an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the standard quantum limit of sensitivity for LIGO and similar detectors. If,\nhowever, the lasers are not shot-noise limited, then these noise sources will limit the detectors' sensitivities.\nTwo expected problems in interferometric GW detectors are the photothermal effect [Braginsky 1999], in which the IFO mirrors expand and contract as heat is deposited into a\nmirror, and the photorefractive (dn/dT) effect [Braginsky 2000], in which optical heating\n\n\f2\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\n\nchanges the indices of refraction of multilayer dielectric mirrors, causing variations in the\nphase shift of the light reflected from a mirror.\nThe test masses in interferometric GW detectors consist of thick, transparent substrates\nwith thin, multilayer dielectric mirrors on their surfaces. Pairs of test masses are arranged\nto make long Fabry-Perot interferometers, so that a strain in spacetime from a gravitational wave will move one end of the IFO relative to the other. If a laser beam is resonant\nwith the IFO, the magnitude and phase of the beam reflected from the IFO will depend\nstrongly on the motions of the mirror. A difficulty arises in that the gravitational waves act\non the center of mass of a test mass, whereas the light senses only the position of the mirror on the mass's surface. Thus, surface effects like thermal expansion, dn/dT, and Brownian motion tend to set sensitivity limits for these instruments.\n1.1 Photothermal noise\nPhotothermal noise is driven by laser intensity fluctuations such as shot noise. Since the\nmanufacturer of the mirrors used in LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave\nObservatory) estimates that they absorb at least 1 ppm of the light that strikes them [1],\nintensity fluctuations in the laser cause length changes in the interferometer, as absorption\nconverts light energy to heat energy, which drives thermal expansion of the mirror and\nsubstrate.\nThere are several theoretical models (see section 1.2) that describe photothermal noise in\nIFOs. Which of these are valid in a particular regime depends on the thermal expansion\ncoefficient \u03b1 , the laser spot size r0 (the radius at which the power is 1/e of the central\nvalue), and the thermal diffusion length Ltherm =\n\n\u03ba \u2044 \u03c1C P \u03c9 . Here, \u03c9 is the frequency of\n\nthe measurement, \u03c1 is the substrate density, C P is its heat capacity, and \u03ba is its thermal\nconductivity.\nAt high frequencies, when Ltherm \u00ab r 0 , an absorbed photon will create a temporary blister\non the mirror. The TEM00 laser beam, reflecting off the mirror, picks up an average phase\nshift which depends on the size, location, and age of the blister. Models of the photothermal effect assume a stochastic background of these blisters, distributed on the mirror surface according to the local intensity of the laser beam. In this regime, the magnitude of\nphotothermal noise predicted by all the models is set by the factor, \u03b1 \u2044 \u03c1C P r0 \u03c9 , neglecting\n2\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n3\n\nconstants and factors of order unity. This is the case for all the interferometric GW detectors presently active: LIGO, GEO, TAMA, and VIRGO all have spot sizes of several cm,\nwhile Ltherm for fused silica at 10 Hz is approximately 0.1 mm.\nTable 1 lists common materials and their relative photothermal effect (neglecting Poisson's ratio). Given a fixed frequency and spot size, the final column contains the photothermal figure of merit for various materials. Fused silica, the substrate of choice for firstgeneration interferometric GW detectors, has the lowest photothermal response of common GW test mass materials, while the response for crystals and metals is quite high.\nTable 1 Thermal properties of potential mirror substrate materials.

Since models of the photothermal effect generally consider only heat\ndeposited at the surface of a uniform, solid substrate, we verified the instrument and the\ntheories with a solid Aluminum mirror.\nOutside of the GW community (and particularly in the semiconductor industry), the photothermal effect is used for measuring the thermal conductivity of materials [Olmstead\n1983], so research has focused on studying optically absorptive materials. There is much\n\n\f4\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\n\nless work on transparent materials like the glasses and crystals used for making mirror\nsubstrates. An interferometer is a natural methodology to study the effect in mirrors,\nwhere the photothermal distance changes may be less than a nanometer.\nDe Rosa et al. [De Rosa 2002] have reported an observation consistent with the photothermal effect in low-absorption (0.5ppm) dielectric mirrors. Their study was done at low frequencies (10 mHz - 200 Hz), at which Ltherm is larger than the thickness of the mirror\ncoating. They used two identical Fabry-Perot interferometers, whose mirrors had fused\nsilica substrates.\n1.2 Models\nThe Braginsky et al. [Braginsky 1999] model for the photothermal effect in interferometers assumes a large laser spot and a semi-infinite substrate. Subsequent work by Liu &\nThorne [Liu 2000] identified corrections on the order of 5% that extend the Braginsky et\nal. model to finite-sized substrates with dimensions comparable to r 0 . A further calculation was made Cerdonio et al. [Cerdonio 2001], who found an analytic solution covering\nlow frequencies and small laser spots for the case of a semi-infinite substrate. As mirror\nsubstrate dimensions are typically much larger than thermal diffusion lengths, there is no\nneed to correct this model in the manner of Liu & Thorne.\nThe Braginsky et al. photothermal model sets an upper limit on the photothermal effect in\nan interferometer mirror. It describes the asymptotic high-frequency response of a semiinfinite mirror, and assumes a negligibly small skin depth of the mirror. Averaged over a\nbeam with a Gaussian intensity profile at normal incidence, the response function (in units\nof length) is:\n\nF B(\u03c9) =\n\nP abs(\u03c9)\n2\u03b1 ( 1 + \u03c3 ) ---------------------------2\n( \u03c1C P \u03c0r0 )\u03c9\n\n(EQ 1)\n\nwhere EQ 1 depends on the frequency \u03c9 , the amount of power absorbed by the mirror\nP abs , and the material properties of the mirror (Table 2):\nTable 2\n\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\ncoefficient of linear thermal expansion\npoisson's ratio\ndensity\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\n\n5\n\nTable 2\n\nCP\nr0\n\u03ba\n\nspecific heat\nlaser spot size (1/e of power)\nthermal conductivity\n\nThe Cerdonio et al. model [Cerdonio 2001] assumes the mirror is much larger than the\nspot size, and is valid at all frequencies:\n\nF C(\u03c9) =\n\nP abs(\u03c9)\n2\n2\u03b1 ( 1 + \u03c3 ) ------------------ K(\u03c9\u03c1Cr 0 \u2044 \u03ba)\n\u03c0\u03ba\n\n(EQ 2)\n\nwhere \u03a9 \u2261 \u03c9\u03c1Cr 0 \u2044 \u03ba and\n2\n\nK( \u03a9 ) =\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b0 \u222b\ndu\n\n2 \u2013u \u2044 2\n2\n\nu e\ndv ----------------------------------------------------------2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2013\u221e\n( u + v ) ( u + v + i\u03a9 )\n\n(EQ 3)\n\nIn the limit of high frequencies (or short diffusion lengths), Cerdonio et al. have shown\nthat K(\u03a9) approaches 1 \u2044 \u03a9 , and EQ 2 approaches EQ 1.\nBoth of these theories assume that the photothermal displacement is both caused and measured by collinear TEM00 Gaussian laser beams. Heat deposited in a mirror will be concentrated at the center of the beam, where the light is most intense. Likewise, observations\nof length changes in the interferometer are dominated by the mirror surface displacement\nat the center of the beam.\n\n2 Materials and Methods\n2.1 Overview\nOur goal is to measure the photothermal response of a single 'test' mirror in a Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer. We split a 500 mW near-IR (1064nm) laser beam into two cross-polarized\nbeams, Force and Measure, and then recombine and resonate them in a Fabry-Perot IFO.\nThe Force beam is used to modulate the light power that strikes the test mirror, while the\nMeasure beam detects length changes in the interferometer.\nThe Force beam is periodically interrupted with a chopping wheel, converting it to a\npulsed beam with a 50% duty cycle. This enables a direct, lock-in measurement of the\nphotothermal effect by recording IFO length changes at the frequency of the chopper. To\n\n\f6\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\n\nmeasure length changes in the IFO, we use the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) [Drever 1983,\nBlack 2001] optical heterodyne technique. This creates an 'error signal' \u03b5 , which, for a\nsmall range of frequencies, is a voltage proportional to the difference between the laser\nfrequency and the cavity resonance frequency. The error signal measures the average displacement of the test mirror surface, weighted by the Gaussian beam profile.\nThis interferometer is made from two mirrors held apart by an aluminum spacer block. Its\ninput mirror (24, Figure 1 on page 7) is a concave fused silica substrate with a dielectric\nmirror coating, a reflectivity of 95%, and a radius of curvature of 1 m. The output, or\n'test', mirror (25) is a solid block of aluminum metal, diamond-turned and polished to\nobtain a flat, 89% reflective surface that absorbs approximately 1-2% of the light that\nstrikes it. The reflectivity of the test mirror is somewhat uncertain, as oxidation and\nscratches can vary along its surface. The mode matching to the IFO is arranged so that the\nlaser spot size at the input mirror is a few mm, while the spot size at the aluminum mirror\nis much smaller at 0.2mm. Since the photothermal effect strongly depends on the spot\nsize, IFO length changes due to the photothermal effect will be dominated by the test mirror. The mode matching is largely insensitive to changes of a few cm in the lengths of the\nseparate paths. The Measure beam, passing through more glass than the Force beam, has a\n4 cm longer optical path length, but this does not significantly affect the coupling of the\nbeams to the cavity.\nThe Measure beam travels through an electro-optical modulator (EOM), which phase\nshifts the beam to add radio frequency (RF) sidebands. When the laser is resonant with the\nIFO, the sidebands will be partially reflected and measured by an RF photodiode (RFPD).\nThe high frequency output of the RFPD is demodulated with the PDH method to generate\nthe error signal that measures changes in the cavity length. The error signal is also used\nwith a feedback servo to keep the laser resonant with the IFO.\n2.2 Materials\nThe equipment used is sketched in Fig. 1:\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\n\n7\n\nFigure 1 Experiment layout.

The mode-matching telescope lenses are misaligned\nfrom the beam by approximately 3o, so that light reflected from them does not reenter the\nlaser. The Faraday Isolator prevents light reflected off downstream optics from returning\nto the laser, and, as a side effect, rotates the beam polarization vector by 45o. A half-wave\nplate (3) restores vertical polarization prior to reflection off of steering mirrors (4). A\nmode-matching lens (5) images a beam waist at the modulator (16) in the Measure path\nand chopper (11) in the Force path.\nAfter the steering mirrors, a half-wave plate (6) rotates the polarization of the beam to\nselect the relative amounts of power that the first polarizing beamsplitter (PBS) (7) will\ndirect into the Force and Measure beams. A PBS projects an incident beam's polarization\nonto its basis vectors: the horizontal component of the incident beam passes straight\nthrough, while the vertical component is reflected to the side. The rated extinction ratio of\n\n\f8\n\na PBS is 1000:1, so that we expect\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\n1\n-----------1000\n\nof the horizontal and vertical components of the\n\nincident beam to exit the PBS along the wrong path.\nIn the Force path, a second PBS (8) turns the beam by 90o. Another Faraday Isolator (9)\ndiverts back-reflections, which are monitored with a photodiode (10). The Force beam is\nchopped with a multi-slit, windmill-style chopper wheel (11), and another half-wave plate\n(12) rotates the polarization to horizontal. Then the Force beam is transmitted through the\nrecombining beamsplitter (22), through the last mode-matching lens (23), and into the\nIFO. The horizontal component of the light that is reflected from the IFO will travel back\nalong this path until it is removed by the Faraday Isolator (9).\nIn the Measure path, the horizontally polarized beam passes through another Faraday Isolator (14) and is rotated to again have horizontal polarization. A resonant electro-optic\nmodulator (EOM) driven by a function generator (RF Oscillator) shifts 2.7% of the Measure energy into optical sidebands at \u00b1 14.75MHz . The PBS (18) combines with the Faraday Rotator (19), half-wave plate (20), and PBS (21) to make a Faraday Isolator that will\nsend light reflected from the IFO to the RF photodiode. The PBS (21) turns the Measure\nbeam toward the final PBS (22), which recombines the square-wave Force beam and frequency-modulated Measure beam along the same path to resonate in the IFO. A small\nfraction of the Force beam is reflected by the final PBS. The F monitor photodiode detects\nthis to track the position of the chopper wheel.\nThe high-frequency variation of the light intensity measured by the RF photodiode is\ndemodulated with a mixer, driven by the same local oscillator as the EOM which created\nthe sidebands. A delay line between the oscillator and mixer is used to maximize the\nresponse of the PDH error signal to length changes of the cavity. The error signal is amplified, recorded, filtered, and fed back to control the laser frequency.\nThe TEM00 resonant axis of the IFO is determined by the line normal to the surface of the\ntest mirror that passes through the center of curvature of the input mirror. We adjust the tip\nand tilt of the optics to maximize the amount of light stored in the cavity on resonance, as\nwe ensure that both Force and Measure beams are collinear after recombination, so that\nthe Force beam heats the same spot that the Measure beam senses.\nThe Fabry-Perot interferometer itself is made of a fused silica input mirror (24) and a solid\naluminum test mirror (25), both held in place by an aluminum spacer block.\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\n\n9\n\nThe input mirror is a standard interferometer mirror from CVI Laser (part PR1-1064-101025-1.00CC) [3] with a commercial multilayer mirror coating formed by electron-beam\ndeposition. Its flat surface has a commercial antireflection coating (R < 0.25%). To reduce\nvibration, its concave, reflective surface abuts the end of the spacer block, and is pressed\nin place from the back under moderate pressure by an O-ring along its perimeter.\nThe test mirror is an aluminum cylinder (6061-T6 alloy) diamond-turned by Janos Technology Inc. (part A8010-101) and polished by CVI Laser. Of the light that it doesn't\nreflect, a good deal is scattered. It is difficult to precisely measure the ratio of absorbed to\nscattered light, as most of the scattered light reflects along the incident beam, but we\nexpect that it absorbs 1-2% of 1 micron wavelength light at normal incidence. The nonreflective surface of this mirror is tapped with three holes and bolted to an aluminum plate\nwhich is itself bolted to the spacer block.\nThe IFO spacer block is a 12.5\"x3\"x3\" rectangular brick of 6061 aluminum with holes\ndrilled in opposite ends and a channel milled from the middle to allow light to travel\nthrough it. It is bolted to a pedestal which is clamped to the workbench. The inside of the\nchannel is lined with layers of thermally insulating plastic and aluminum foil to prevent\nscattered light from being absorbed by the walls of the block. The channel is covered with\na transparent acrylic lid to allow scattered light to escape, while preventing air currents\nfrom shaking the mirror surfaces.\nA major challenge in designing this apparatus is controlling the cross-talk between the\nbeams. Consider the Force beam, which is chopped, then impinges upon and is partially\nreflected from the IFO. If the Force beam heading into the IFO has a vertical component\nto its polarization vector, the process of separating and recombining the paths will create a\nMach-Zender interferometer. Any component of Force with vertical polarization that\nreflects from the IFO will travel back along the Measure path and into the RF photodiode.\nThis can cause a small systematic error in the measurement. We reduce this effect by carefully adjusting waveplates and by doubling beamsplitters, such as parts 17 and 21, which\n4\n\n5\n\ncombine with their neighbors to allow an extinction ratio of 10 :1 to 10 :1. A detailed\nanalysis of the effects of cross-talk is discussed in section 4.1.\n\n\f10\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\n\n2.3 Calibration\nA summary of the measured properties of the interferometer is given in table 3.

The fast (55 kHz) response of\nthe PZT is used to lock the laser to the IFO (See page 12). The PZT tuning coefficient was\nmeasured with a high-finesse cavity.\nThe finesse of the cavity is determined by scanning it with a low-power laser beam\n(Fig. 2). An oscilloscope records the PDH signal (yellow), the reflected power measured\nat the RF photodiode (blue), light power scattered from the end mirror (a measure of the\nlight stored in the cavity) (purple), and the control voltage sent to the PZT crystal that controls the laser frequency (green). The full-width at half-max of the scattered light peak is\n12.1 MHz, implying a finesse of 37. The height of the dip in the reflected power trace indicates that the cavity's visibility is 50%.\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\n\n11\n\nFigure 2 Yellow: Error signal, Blue: Reflected power of the Measure beam, Purple: Light scattered from IFO, Green:\nLaser frequency control (6.3 MHz/V).

The phase \u03b8 characterizes the delay box\nattached to the RF oscillator. This plot can also be used to measure the discriminant, but a\nmore accurate method is described in section 2.4. The equation describing the PDH signal\nas a function of frequency is defined in [Black 2001] and in the Appendix (EQ 21).\nFigure 3 Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) error signal.

A two-parameter fit (Fig. 5)\nto the data was used to determine the PZT bandwidth ( f PZT , 55kHz) and the DC gain (104)\nof the OLTF. The servo amplifier gain (50) and pole (10 Hz) were measured directly. The\nPDH discriminant is the DC gain of the OLTF divided by the DC gains of the other components, C PDH = 104 \u2044 ( 50 \u22c5 C PZT ) . This function agrees well with the magnitude\nresponse of the servo, but differs in phase by a few degrees from 400 Hz to 4 kHz. Multiplying the OLTF function with a shallow resonance H res more accurately predicts the\nphase; the function OLTF \u22c5 H res is obscured by the data points in the phase plot of Fig. 6.\nThe zero (1050 Hz) and pole (1130 Hz) of the resonance function are obtained from a fit to\nthe phase data:\n\n1 + if \u2044 ( 1050 Hz )\nH res = ------------------------------------------1 + if \u2044 ( 1130 Hz )\n\n(EQ 5)\n\nAn effect of the control system is to suppress the measurements by a factor of the return\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\n\n13\n\ndifference function, H R-D , with which the data are compensated in the analysis.\n\n1\nH R-D = --------------------------------------1 + OLTF \u22c5 H res\n\n(EQ 6)\n\nFigure 5 Magnitude response of the control servo\n\nOpen- loop transfer function\n100\n\nMagnitude\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n1000\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n10000\n\n100000.\n\n\f14\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\nFigure 6 Phase response of the control servo\n\nOpen- loop transfer function\n0\n\nPhase degrees\n\n- 25\n- 50\n- 75\n- 100\n- 125\n- 150\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n1000\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n10000\n\n100000.\n\n3 Results\nTo measure the photothermal effect, we chop the Force beam at various frequencies from\n5 Hz to 4 kHz while recording the behavior of the interferometer in the time domain. For\neach data point, the chopping frequency is set manually. A Tektronix TDS3014 digital\noscilloscope records and averages the error signal and photodiode outputs in the timedomain, triggering on the photodiode that monitors the chopper wheel (Fig. 7).\nFigure 7 Scope trace showing 512 averages of measurements of the photothermal effect in the interferometer.

For most points, 512\nsamples are averaged. At 20 Hz and below, fewer samples are needed. To set an upper\nlimit on systematic error (See section 4), we also measure the DC output of the photodiode\nwith a digital lock-in amplifier, triggered by the TTL signal from the chopper wheel.\nSince the photothermal effect is described by a linear system, we can characterize it by its\nfrequency response. For each measurement frequency, we convolve each channel with\nsine and cosine functions at the chopper wheel frequency \u03c9 , assuming an arbitrary start\npoint, and integrating over an integer number of cycles. From this, we calculate the magnitude response of the photothermal effect in units of Meters/Watt:\n2\n\n2\n\n\u3008 sin ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 \u03b5(t)\u3009 + \u3008 cos ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 \u03b5(t)\u3009\nC PDH \u00d7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- H R-D (f)\nP F(\u03c9)\n\n(EQ 7)\n\nThe numerator in EQ 7 is the magnitude of the Fourier component of the displacement of\nthe mirror at the chopper frequency. Likewise, PF(\u03c9) is the Fourier component of the\npower absorbed by the test mirror at the chopper frequency. P F(\u03c9) is the product of the\npower in the Force beam (122 mW), the power absorption of the test mirror (1.33%), the\nvisibility of the IFO (0.5), the finesse of the IFO (37), and a factor of 1 \u2044 \u03c0 (the magnitude\nof the fundamental mode of a square wave is 1 \u2044 \u03c0 of its peak-to-peak amplitude). The\noverall scaling of the magnitude data is set by adjusting the absorptivity of the test mirror\nbetween 1% and 2%. This method lets us plot the data directly against the models F B(\u03c9)\nand F C(\u03c9) by setting P abs = 1W . This choice of normalization does not affect the phase\nmeasurement.\nThe phase of the photothermal effect is measured by comparing the phase difference\nbetween the fundamental frequency components of \u03b5 and the chopper signal. The effect of\nthe servo is compensated for by adding the phase of the return-difference function:\n\n\u3008 cos ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 \u03b5(t)\u3009- \u2013 atan ----------------------------------------------\u3008 cos ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 Chop(t)\u3009- + phase(H\natan ------------------------------------R-D (f))\n\u3008 sin ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 \u03b5(t)\u3009\n\u3008 sin ( \u03c9t ) \u22c5 Chop(t)\u3009\n\n(EQ 8)\n\nThe predictions for these plots use the properties of Aluminum 6061-T6 shown in Table 1.\nPoisson's ratio is assumed to be \u03c3 = 0.33 , and the thermal conductivity is \u03ba = 140 W/\nmK.

We thus expect to see glitches in the PDH signal as the chopper blade transcects\nthe beam, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 9.\n\u2022 This also means that, at high frequencies, the phase difference between the PDH and\nCHOP signals is not well defined.\n\u2022 The height of the photothermal 'blister' is typically much smaller than the surface\nroughness of the mirror, so beam distortion effects are negligible.\nFigure 9 Single data trace. CHOP low means the Force beam is blocked. Left: The arrow indicates a jump in the PDH\nsignal. This is the measurement with the most obvious systematic error.

Nominally, these\nhave orthogonal polarizations, and their reflections from the cavity will be separated. In\npractice, we observe a small amount of each reflecting along the path of the other.\nTo describe this crosstalk, we define the variable \u03b6 as the power fraction of the light\n2\n\nreflected along the wrong path. Since the PDH method measures the light field, not its\npower, \u03b6 sets the upper limit on the systematic magnitude error due to interference\nbetween the Force and Measure beams at the RFPD. With the Force beam at maximum\npower (272 mW) and the Measure beam blocked after the first PBS, the RFPD observes\nless than 1 mW of power, which sets the limit \u03b6 < 0.06 . We can improve this limit by con-\n\n\fError Analysis\n\n19\n\ntinuously monitoring the crosstalk as we collect data.\nFigure 10 Left: Expected systematic magnitude error, Right: Measured deviation from model\nMagnitude fit error\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\nDifference from model\n\nFractional deviation\n\nExpected magnitude error\n0.025\n\n0.015\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n- 0.02\n\n- 0.04\n0.005\n10\n\n50\n\n100\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nTo acquire data, we measure the light reflected along the Measure path with a RF Photodiode (RFPD) to obtain the error signal. Interference between the Force and Measure\nbeams causes a small jump in the PDH signal correlated with the chopper wheel, and\ncauses a systematic error in the photothermal measurement. The fractional size of the\njump in the length measurement is equivalent to the fractional variation in the DC measurement at the photodiode (see Appendix).\nThe amplitude variations we measured are less than 1% of the DC value for most measurements, which is smaller than the data points in Fig. 8.\n4.2 Phase uncertainty\nWe use different chopper wheels above and below 400 Hz. Below 400 Hz the a chopper\nwheel has wide gaps, but above 400 Hz, the beam diameter is 0.5mm, while the distance\nbetween the blades is 5mm. This leads to the wide CHOP transition in Fig. 11. The two\nvertical lines in Fig. 11 show the phase relative to the beginning of the time series where\nthe chopper signal passes through its midpoint. The phase difference between these points\nought to be 180o, but is actually 175o. We estimate that the systematic error in our calculation of the phase of the photothermal effect is the difference between these angles. Fig. 12\nshows the expected systematic phase error for each point and the difference between the\nphase of the data and the phase of the model. The deviation of the data from the model is\nwithin our phase measurement uncertainty.\n\n\f20\n\nThe Photothermal Effect in Interferometers\nFigure 11\n\n2806.1 Hz\n0.1 ms/div\n\nPDH\nDC\nCHOP\n\n142o\n\n50 mV/div\n20 mV/div\n500 mV/div\n\n317o\n\nCHOP transition\n\nFigure 12 Left: Expected systematic phase error, Right: Phase difference from measurement\nCHOP phase jitter\n\nPhase fit error\n4\n\n6\n\n2\nDifference from model\n\nError [degress]\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n1\n-8\n0\n10\n\n50\n\n100\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n4.3 Beam width\nFig. 9 shows the scope trace with the largest chopper glitches in the PDH signal. By\ninspection, you can see that the area of the bumps indicated by the arrows is less than 1%\nof the area under the rest of the curve. The glitch is disproportionately represented in the\nmagnitude measurement, which is based on a sine convolution with this curve. The total\neffect is an overestimate of the magnitude on the order of 1%. Since the glitch is symmetric at high and low peaks, we consider its effect on the phase measurement to be minor.\n\n\fConclusions\n\n21\n\n5 Conclusions\nOur measurements of the photothermal effect in a solid metal mirror show good agreement with the theories proposed by Braginsky et al. and Cerdonio et al., which assume a\nmirror made from a homogenous, semi-infinite solid.
