Further generalizations of Tamagawa number\nconjecture by Fontaine, Perrin-Riou, and the author [FP], [Pe1 ] [Ka1 ], [Ka2 ] have\nthe form\n(0.4)\nzeta functions (= Euler products, analytic)\n\u2194 zeta elements (= Euler systems, arithmetic)\n\u2194 arithmetic groups.\nHere the first \u2194 means that zeta functions enter the arithmetic world transforming\nthemselves into zeta elements, and the second \u2194 means that zeta elements generate\n\"determinants\" of certain etale cohomology groups.\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss (0.4) in an expository style. We review\n(0.1) in \u00a71, and then in \u00a72, we describe the generalized Tamagawa number conjecture\n(0.4), the relation with (0.2), and an application of the philosophy (0.4) to (0.3).\nIn this paper, we fix a prime number p. For a commutative ring R, let Q(R)\nbe the total quotient ring of R obtained from R by inverting all non-zerodivisors.\n\n1. Grothendieck formula and zeta elements\nLet X be a scheme of finite type over a finite field Fq . We assume p is different\nfrom char(Fq ).\nIn this \u00a71, we first review the formula (1.1.2) of Grothendieck representing zeta\nfunctions of p-adic sheaves on X by etale cohomology. We then show that those\nzeta functions are recovered from p-adic zeta elements (1.3.5).\n1.1. Zeta functions and etale cohomology groups in positive characQ\nteristic case. The Hasse zeta function \u03b6(X, s) = x\u2208|X| (1 \u2212 \u266f\u03ba(x)\u2212s )\u22121 , where\n|X| denotes the set of all closed points of x and \u03ba(x) denotes the residue field of x,\nhas the form \u03b6(X, s) = \u03b6(X/Fq , q \u2212s ) where\nY\n\n\u03b6(X/Fq , u) =\n\n(1 \u2212 udeg(x) )\u22121 ,\n\ndeg(x) = [\u03ba(x) : Fq ].\n\n(1.1.1)\n\nx\u2208|X|\n\nA part of Weil conjectures was that \u03b6(X/Fq , u) is a rational function in u,\nand it was proved by Dwork and then slighly later by Grothendieck. The proof of\nGrothendieck gives a presentation of \u03b6(X/Fq , u) by using etale cohomologyy. More\ngenerally, for a finite extension L of Qp and for a constructible L-sheaf F on X,\nGrothendieck proved that the L-function L(X/Fq , F , u) has the presentation\nL(X/Fq , F , u) =\n\nY\nm\n\nm\ndetL (1 \u2212 \u03c6q u ; Het,c\n(X \u2297Fq F\u0304q , F ))(\u22121)\n\nm\u22121\n\n(1.1.2)\n\n\fTamagawa Number Conjecture for zeta Values\n\n165\n\nm\nwhere Het,c\nis the etale cohomology with compact supports and \u03c6q is the action of\nthe q-th power morphism on X.\nIn the case L = Qp = F , \u03b6(X/Fq , u) = L(X/Fq , F , u).\n\n1.2. p-adic zeta elements in positive characteristic case. Determinants\nappear in the theory of zeta functions as above, rather often. The regulator of a\nnumber field, which appears in the class number formula, is a determinant. Such\nrelation with determinant is well expressed by the notion of \"determinant module\".\nIf R is a field, for an R-module V of dimension r, detR (V ) means the 1 dimensional R-module \u2227rR (V ). For a bounded complex C of R-modules whose cohomolom\ngies H m (C) are finite dimensional, detR (C) means \u2297m\u2208Z {detR (H m (C))}\u2297(\u22121) .\nThis definition is generalized to the definition of an invertible R-module detR (C)\nassociated to a perfect complex C of R-modules for a commutative ring R (see\n[KM]). det\u22121\nR (C) means the inverse of the invertible module detR (C).\nBy a pro-p ring, we mean a topological ring which is an inverse limit of finite\nrings whose orders are powers of p. Let \u039b be a commutative pro-p ring. By a ctf\n\u039b-complex on X, we mean a complex of \u039b-sheaves on X for the etale topology with\nconstructible cohomology sheaves and with perfect stalks. For a ctf \u039b-complex F\non X, R\u0393et,c (X, F ) (c means with compact supports) is a perfect complex over \u039b.\nFor a commutative pro-p ring \u039b and for a ctf \u039b-complex F on X, we define the\n\u22121\np-adic zeta element \u03b6(X, F , \u039b) which is a \u039b-basis of det\u039b\nR\u0393et,c (X, F ).

Zeta functions and p-adic zeta elements in positive characteristic case. Let L be a finite extension of Qp , let OL be the valuation ring of\nL, and let F be a constructible OL -sheaf on X. We show that the zeta function\nL(X/Fq , FL , u) of the L-sheaf FL = F \u2297OL L is recovered from a certain p-adic\nzeta element as in (1.3.5) below. Let\n\n\u039b = OL [[Gal(F\u0304q /Fq )]] = lim\n\u2190\u2212 OL [Gal(Fqn /Fq )].\n\n(1.3.1)\n\nn\n\nLet s(\u039b) be the \u039b-module \u039b which is regarded as a sheaf on the etale site of X via\nthe natural action of Gal(F\u0304q /Fq ).

Tamagawa number conjecture\nIn 2.1, we describe the generalized version of Tamagawa number conjecture.\nIn 2.2 (resp. 2.3), we consider p-adic zeta elements associated to 1 (resp. 2) dimensional p-adic representations of Gal(Q\u0304/Q), and their relations to (0.2) (resp.\n(0.3)).\n2.1. The conjecture. Let X be a scheme of finite type over Z[ 1p ]. For a\ncomplex of sheaves F on X for the etale topology, we define the compact support\nversion R\u0393et,c (X, F ) of R\u0393et (X, F ) as the mapping fiber of\n1\nR\u0393et (Z[ ], Rf! F ) \u2192 R\u0393et (R, Rf! F ) \u2295 R\u0393et (Qp , Rf!

In [BK], the idea of Tamagawa number of\nmotives was important, but it does not appear explicitly in this version.\nConjecture. To any triple (X, \u039b, F ) consisting of a scheme X of finite type over\nZ[ p1 ], a commutative pro-p ring \u039b, and a ctf \u039b-complex on X, we can associate a\n\u039b-basis \u03b6(X, F , \u039b) of\n\u2206(X, F , \u039b) = det\u22121\n\u039b R\u0393et,c (X, F ),\n\n\fTamagawa Number Conjecture for zeta Values\n\n167\n\nwhich we call the p-adic zeta element associated to F , satisfying the following conditions (2.1.1)-(2.1.5).\n(2.1.1) If X is a scheme over a finite field Fq , \u03b6(X, F , \u039b) coincides with the element\ndefined in \u00a73.2.\n(2.1.2) (rough form) If F is the p-adic realization of a motive M , \u03b6(X, F , \u039b)\nrecovers the complex value lims\u21920 s\u2212e L(M, s) where L(M, s) is the zeta function of\nM and e is the order of L(M, s) at s = 0.\n(2.1.3) If \u039b\u2032 is a pro-p ring and \u039b \u2192 \u039b\u2032 is a continuous homomorphism, \u03b6(X, F \u2297L\n\u039b\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u223c\n\u039b\u2032 , \u039b\u2032 ) coincides with the image of \u03b6(X, F , \u039b) under \u2206(X, F \u2297L\n\u039b \u039b , \u039b ) = \u2206(X, F )\u2297\u039b\n\u039b\u2032 .\n(2.1.4) For a distinguished triangle F \u2032 \u2192 F \u2192 F \" with common X and \u039b, we have\n\u03b6(X, F , \u039b) = \u03b6(X, F \u2032 , \u039b)\u2297\u03b6(X, F \", \u039b) in \u2206(X, F , \u039b) = \u2206(X, F \u2032 , \u039b)\u2297\u039b \u2206(X, F \", \u039b).\n(2.1.5) If Y is a scheme of finite type over Z[ p1 ] and f : X \u2192 Y is a separated\nmorphism,\n\u03b6(Y, Rf!

How to formulate the part (4.1.2) of this conjecture is reduced\nto the case of motives over Q by (2.1.5) and L(M, s) = L(Rf! (M ), s) (by philosophy\nof motives), where f : X \u2192 Spec(Z[ 1p ]).\nThe conditions (2.1.3)-(2.1.5) are formal properties which are analogous to\nformal properties of zeta functions. The conditions (2.1.1) and (2.1.3)-(2.1.5) can\nbe interpreted as\n(2.1.6) The system (X, \u039b, F ) 7\u2192 \u03b6(X, F , \u039b) is an \"Euler system\".\nIn fact, let L be a finite extension of Qp , S a finite set of prime numbers\ncontaining p, and let T be a free OL -module of finite rank endowed with a continuous\nOL -linear action of Gal(Q\u0304/Q) which is unramified outside S. For m \u2265 1, let\nRm = OL [Gal(Q(\u03b6m )/Q)] and let\n1\nzm = \u03b6Rm (Z[ p1 ], jm,!

Then the zeta function L(M, s) lives in C, and\nthe p-adic zeta element lives in the world of p-adic etale cohomology. Since these\ntwo worlds are too much different in nature, L(M, s) and the p-adic zeta element\nare not simply related.\n\n\f168\n\nKazuya Kato\n\nHowever in the middle of C and the p-adic world,\n(a) there is a 1 dimensional K-vector space \u2206K (M ) constructed by the Betti\nrealization and the de Rham realization of M , and K-groups (or motivic cohomology\ngroups) associated to M .\nLet \u221e be an Archimedean place of K.

As the\nother question marks indicate, we do not know how to construct zeta elements in\ngeneral, at present.\n2.2. p-adic zeta elements for 1 dimensional galois representations.\nLet \u039b be a commutative pro-p ring, and assume we are given a continuous homomorphism\n\u03c1 : Gal(Q\u0304/Q) \u2192 GLn (\u039b)\nwhich is unramified outside a finite set S of prime numbers S containing p. Let\nF = \u039b\u2295n on which Gal(Q\u0304/Q) acts via \u03c1, regarded as a sheaf on Spec(Z[ S1 ]) for the\netale topology. We consider how to construct the p-adic zeta element \u03b6(Z[ S1 ], F , \u039b).\nIn the case n = 1, we can use the \"universal objects\" as follows. Such \u03c1 comes\nfrom the canonical homomorphism\n\n\u03c1univ : Gal(Q\u0304/Q) \u2192 GL1 (\u039buniv ) where \u039buniv = Zp [[Gal(Q(\u03b6N p\u221e )/Q)]]\nfor some N \u2265 1 whose set of prime divisors coincide with S and for some continuous\nring homomorphism \u039buniv \u2192 \u039b. We have F \u223c\n= Funiv \u2297\u039buniv \u039b. Hence \u03b6(Z[ S1 ], F , \u039b)\nshould be defined to be the image of \u03b6(Z[ S1 ], Funiv , \u039buniv). As is explained in [Ka2 ]\nCh. I, 3.3, \u03b6(Z[ S1 ], Funiv , \u039buniv ) is the pair of the p-adic Riemann zeta function and\na system of cyclotomic units. Iwasawa main conjecture is regarded as the statemnet\nthat this pair is a \u039buniv -basis of \u2206(Z[ S1 ], Funiv , \u039buniv ).\n2.3. p-adic zeta elements for 2 dimensional Galois representations.\nNow consider the case n = 2. The works of Hida, Wiles, and other people suggest\nthat the universal objects \u039buniv and Funiv for 2 dimensional Galois representations\nin which the determinant of the action of the complex conjugation is -1, are given\nby\nn\n\u039buniv = lim\n\u2190\u2212 p-adic Hecke algebras of weight 2 and of level N p ,\nn\n\n1\nn\nFuniv = lim\n\u2190\u2212 H of modular curves of level N p .\nn\n\nBeilinson [Be] discovered ratinal zeta elements in K2 of modular curves, and the images of these elements in the etale cohomology under the Chern class maps become\np-adic zeta elements, and the inverse limit of these p-adic zeta elements should be\n\u03b6(Z[ S1 ], Funiv , \u039buniv ) at least conjecturally. By using this plan, the author obtained\np-adic zeta elements for motives associated to eigen cusp forms of weight \u2265 2, from\nBeilinson elements. Here it is not yet proved that these p-adic zeta elements are\nactually basis of \u2206, but it can be proved that they have the desired relations with\nvalues L(E, \u03c7, 1) and L(f, \u03c7, r) (1 \u2264 r \u2264 k \u2212 1) for elliptic curves over Q (which\nare modular by [Wi], [BCDT]) and for eigen cusp forms of weight k \u2265 2, and for\nDirichlet charcaters \u03c7. Beilinson elements are related in the Archimedean world\nto lims\u21920 s\u22121 L(E, \u03c7, s) for elliptic curves E over Q, but not related to L(E, \u03c7, 1).\nHowever since they become universal (at least conjecturally) in the inverse limit in\n\n\f170\n\nKazuya Kato\n\nthe p-adic world, we can obtain from them p-adic zeta elements related to L(E, \u03c7, 1).\nUsing these elements and applying the method of Euler systems [Ko], [Pe2 ], [Ru2 ],\n[Ka3 ], we can obtain the following results ([Ka4 ]).\nTheorem. Let E be an elliptic curve over Q, let N \u2265 1, and let \u03c7 : Gal(Q(\u03b6N )/Q)\n\u223c\n= (Z/N Z)\u00d7 \u2192 C be a homomorphism. If L(E, \u03c7, 1) 6= 0, the \u03c7-part of E(Q(\u03b6N ))\nand the \u03c7 part of the Tate-shafarevich group of E over Q(\u03b6N ) are finite.\nThe p-adic L-function Lp (E) of E is constructed from the values L(E, \u03c7, 1).\nTheorem. Let E be an elliptic curve over Q which is of good reduction at p.\n(1) rank(E(Q) \u2264 ords=1 Lp (E).\n(2) Assume E is ordinary at p. Let \u039b = Zp [[Gal(Q(\u03b6p\u221e /Q)]]. Then the\np-primary Selmer group of E over Q(\u03b6p\u221e ) is \u039b-cotorsion and its characteristic\npolynomial divides pn Lp (E) for some n.\nThis result was proved by Rubin in the case of elliptic curves with complex\nmultiplication ([Ru1 ]).\nAs described above, we can obtain p-adic zeta elements of motives associated\nto eigen cusp forms of weight \u2265 2. For such modular forms, we can prove the\nanalogous statement as the above (2).\nMazur and Greenberg conjectured that the charcteristic polynomial of the\nabove p-primary Selmer group and the p-adic L-function divide each other.\n\nReferences\n[Be]\n\nBeilinson, A., Higher regulators and values of L-functions, J.
