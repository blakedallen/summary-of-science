Naturally it was addressed the question\nif the lifetime extracted from the EF analysis is identifiable with the value extracted previously from the angular\ndistributions of the final fragments. The authors of ref.\n[2] pointed out that the DNS lifetime extracted by these\ntwo methods are close to each other. They reached this\nconclusion based on a reaction model in which the partial coherence mechanism already addressed in [3, 4] has\nbeen considered. Indeed the model leads to an angular\ndistribution pattern having a degree of focusing given by\nthe number of interfering partial waves and to fluctuating\nexcitation functions. The analysis within this model has\nbeen done for the 28 Si + 64 Ni and 12 C + 24 Mg systems\nfor which experimental information was available by that\ntime. Afterwards the excitations functions in dissipative\nheavy ion collisions (DHIC) have been measured and analyzed for other light and medium mass systems: 19 F +\n89\nY, 28 Si + 48 Ti, 19 F + 63 Cu, 28 Si + 28 Si, 19 F + 51 V [5].\nA new model, Partial Overlapping Molecular Level\nModel (POMLM), has been also developed in order to\nexplain the presence of the fluctuations in the EF for\nDHIC introducing, besides the partial coherence, the hypothesis that the DNS is excited in the low density region\nof molecular levels [6].The large amplitude of the fluctuations persists due to the lower density of the states in\nthe vicinity of the yrast line. An unified explanation\n\nfor fluctuation phenomenom in the excitation functions\nof elastic, inelastic and deep inelastic collision has been\nobtained.\nThe aim of the excitation functions for 19 F + 27 Al and\n27\nAl + 27 Al collisions measured by us was to see to what\nextent the fluctuation phenomenom is present in the case\nof these light systems where none of the participants to\nthe reaction is an \u03b1-conjugate nucleus.\nFor the system 19 F + 27 Al the excitation functions\nhave been obtained for the final fragments with Z = 6\n- 12 for a total kinetic energy loss (TKEL) window of 5\nMeV width centered at 20 and 30 MeV in order to study\nthe dependence of this phenomenom on TKEL. Such a\nstudy has not been addressed before. Non-statistical fluctuations have been evidenced in the cross section EFs\nof final fragments and for the corresponding fluctuation\ncorrelation widths, \u0393, no dependence on Z, TKEL and\nfragment emission angle, \u03b8cm , has been observed within\nerror limit [7]. An average value of \u0393 of (170\u00b165) keV has\nbeen obtained. The corresponding DNS lifetime (3.9 \u00b1\n1.1)*10\u221221 sec is in agreement with the values extracted\nfrom angular distribution studies [8].\nThe present paper presents results obtained for the\n27\nAl + 27 Al collision. After a short review of the experimental procedures and the criteria used to select deep\ninelastic events in Section II, results obtained from cross\nsection EFs analysis for the 27 Al + 27 Al system are reported in subsection III A of the paper. The subsection\nIII B is dedicated to the presentation of a study of the influence of the evaporation corrections on the fluctuating\nstructure of EF. A pattern of the energy autocorrelation\nfunction with secondary damped oscillations besides the\nLorentzian structure from \u03b5 = 0, where \u03b5 is the energy\n\n\f2\nincrement in the center of mass system (CMS), was obtained. The observed oscillation periodicity could be explained if hyperdeformed rotational states are supposed\nto be excited in DNS during the collision [11, 12]. This\naspect is discussed in subsection III C. Conclusions are\npresented in Section IV.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nThe experiment was performed at the SMP Tandem\naccelerator from LNS -Catania using 27 Al ions with incident energies Elab = (122 - 132) MeV. The energy loss in\nself supported targets of 27 Al (\u2248 75 keV) is less than the\nenergy increment of 250 keV (125 keV in CMS) between\ntwo successive experimental points. The beam current\nwas measured with a tantalum plated Faraday cup provided with an electron suppressing guard ring.\nThe reaction products were detected and identified using the experimental device DRACULA [13, 14] from\nwhich only the large area position sensitive ionization\nchambers (ICs) and the corresponding parallel plate\navalanche counters in front of them have been operated.\nThe ICs were filled with Ar(90%) + CH4 (10%) at 106.8\ntorr. The polar and azimuthal angles spanned by the\nIC were \u2206\u03b8 = 24\u25e6 , \u2206\u03c6 = 4\u25e6 , respectively. The energy\nresolution at the elastic peak was 2.5%, the angular resolution 0.5\u25e6 and the charge resolution better than 0.3\ncharge units. The ICs being centered at 24\u25e6 in the laboratory system, an angular range 12\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8lab \u2264 36\u25e6 was\ncovered continuously in a single measurement for each\nincident energy. The grazing angle at Elab =132 MeV is\nof \u2248 15 \u25e6 , so the weight of deep inelastic processes was\nincreased within the measured angular interval. Nevertheless, a quasielastic component is present in the TKE\nspectra of fragments with Z = 11, 12 as could be seen in\nFig. 1 for Elab = 128 MeV.\nThe arrows on the figure represent the energies corresponding to complete energy damping [15]. The excitation functions for deep inelastic processes are obtained\ntaking events with TKE larger than these values and well\nbellow the quasielastic component. The TKE window\nused for Elab = 128 MeV is represented by the hatched\narea on Fig. 1 and corresponds to the total kinetic energy loss window from 20 to 32 MeV, kept the same for\nall incident energies.\n\nIII.\n\nCROSS SECTION EXCITATION\nFUNCTIONS\nA.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe obtained excitation functions present fluctuations\nwith quite large amplitude as could be observed in\nFigs. 2, where the EFs corresponding to Z = 8 - 12, 14\nare given. The full circles represent the cross section of\n\nFIG. 1: Total kinetic energy spectra for Z = 8 - 12, 14 reaction\nproducts in the 27 Al + 27 Al collision at incident energy Elab\n= 128 MeV.\n\nthe primary products and the empty triangles of the secondary ones.\nThe influence of the evaporation corrections on the\nEFs, obtained from comparing the results for these two\nsets of EF, will be discussed in subsection III B. In the\nfollowing we refer only to the analysis of the EF for primary products. Fluctuations with amplitude larger than\nthe statistical errors, which are of symbol size, could be\nobserved. The statistical analysis of the EFs has been\ndone following the recipe from Ref. [16]. Fluctuations\npresent in the EFs corresponding to different final channels are strongly correlated, evidenced by large channel\ncross correlation coefficients, CZi Zj , as can be seen in Table I. This shows that the observed fluctuations are not\nof compound nucleus origin. Taking into account this\ncorrelation, in order to improve the statistics, it was obtained an EF by summing the EFs for reaction products\nhaving higher yields (Z = 8, 11 and 12), which is given\nin the bottom panel of Fig. 2.\nThe experimental energy autocorrelation functions for\nthe reaction product with the highest yield (Z=12) and\nfor summed EF are presented in Fig. 3 by full circles.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental energy autocorrelation functions\n(points) and its fit with a Lorentzian function (dashed line);\nthe full circles and empty triangles have the same meaning as\nin Fig. 2.\n\nFIG. 2: Excitation functions for Z = 8 - 12 fragments with\nTKEL = (20 - 32) MeV produced 27 Al + 27 Al reaction (panels\n(a) - (e)), and summed EF of Z = 8, 11 and 12 products\n(panel (f)); the full circles represent the EFs after evaporation\ncorrections (for primary products) and the empty triangles\nbefore their application (for secondary products).\n\nThe average of the cross section over incoming energy has\nbeen obtained using the moving gauss averaging procedure [17]. The extracted fluctuation correlation widths\n\u0393p , by fitting the experimental EAFs with a Lorentzian\nfunction (thick dashed line in the same figure), are given\nin the first column of Table II. The error of \u2248 25% in\nthe evaluation of \u0393p is mainly due to finite range of data\n(FRD).

(1)).\n\nThe thin continuous line on the same figure represents\nl = f (T KE) as given by the calculation based on the\ntransport model (DONA code) [19] for the higher limit\nof the measured energy interval. One can see that the description of the l dependence on T KE within the transport model extensively used for heavy systems works\nquite well for light systems too as it was already noticed\nin our first study of a light system [20].\n\nB.\n\nInfluence of the evaporation corrections on\ncross section EF\n\nThe extended theory of Ericson fluctuations and the\nother models developed in order to explain the presence\nof non-statistical fluctuations in DHIC [21] are elaborated for primary reaction products. Experimentally are\nmeasured the observables of secondary products and for\ncomparison with models, evaporation corrections have to\nbe done. The energy spectra were corrected for nucleon\nevaporation using the iterative procedure described in\nRef. [22]. A parameterization of neutron and proton\nseparation energies as a function of N/Z ratio elaborated\nfor the mass region up to 50 has been used [8]. In order\nto estimate the influence of these corrections on the EFs\nof the reaction products resulted from the 27 Al + 27 Al\ninteraction, we decided to construct also a set of EFs before the evaporation corrections. These are represented\nwith empty triangles in Fig. 2. At the first sight no\nsizable differences between the two sets of EFs could be\nseen. For a more quantitative evaluation, we calculated\nEAFs for EFs obtained without evaporation corrections.\nThese are represented with empty triangles in Fig. 3.\nThe extracted \u0393s values are given in the second column\n\nDeformation of di-nuclear system\n\nExperimental EAF of DHIC shows, besides the\nLorentzian structure at \u03b5 = 0, secondary oscillations\n[5, 7, 18]. It was shown that these oscillations appear\nwhen the lifetime of DNS is equal or greater than its rotation period as a result of interference between different\nrevolutions [9, 10]. The period of the secondary structures is given by \u03b5 = h\u0304\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the angular velocity\nof the di-nucleus.\nThe experimental value of \u03b5 in connection with the\nmost probable kinetic energy hTKEi could be used to\nobtain an evaluation of the separation distance at the\nbreak-up moment of the composite (di-nuclear) system\nand, in this way, information on the deformation of the\nsystem during the interaction.\nThe energy autocorrelation functions from Fig. 3\npresent secondary structures with a period of \u2248 0.85\nMeV. Such a period of oscillation implies for the distance\nof separation a value of r \u2248 10.9 fm, taking for the angular momentum the sticking configuration value given\nby lst = l(1 \u2212 Jint /Jtot ), where l = (lgr + lcr )/2) and\nJint , Jtot are the intrinsic and total momenta of inertia,\nrespectively. For lgr we used the value of 47.8h\u0304 calculated with the DONA code for Elab = 128 MeV, and lcr\n= 43.7h\u0304 was calculated using the formula given in Ref.\n[23]. The value of the separation distance is compatibile\nwith that obtained by us for the 19 F + 27 Al system [7].\nFor this value of the separation distance one obtains, for\nfragmentation 23 Na + 31 P, a value of hTKEi equal to 41.6\nMeV. It was supposed that hTKEi equals the final channel barrier given by the sum of the Coulomb and centrifugal energies [24, 25]. The centrifugal energy is calculated\nfor l = lst \u2248 32.7 . This value is in a good agreement\nwith the experimental most probable TKE of \u2248 42 MeV\ncorresponding to Z = 11 (see corresponding panel of Fig.\n1). One has to remark also that the used value of lst is\nwithin the l-window (l = 27 - 33) corresponding to the\nintegration TKEL window (TKE = 32 - 44 MeV) given\nby the transport model calculation (thin continuous line\nin Fig. 4(b)). The separation distance values otained for\nboth studied systems mean a quite large deformation for\nthe reaction partners of the DNS. For relative momentum of inertia at break-up, the following relation can be\nwritten:\nJrel (r) = 1.97 * Jrel (Rint ),\n1/3\n\nwhere Rint = r\u25e6 (A1\nradius.\n\n1/3\n\n(2)\n\n+ A2 ) is the usual interaction\n\n\f5\nIt was also necessary to consider larger momenta of\ninertia in order to explain the period of secondary oscillations observed in the EAF of other systems (12 C +\n24\nMg, 24 Mg + 24 Mg and 28 Si + 28 Si) in this mass region\n[11, 12], while the period of secondary structures of EAF\nfor heavier systems (19 F + 89 Y, 58 Ni + 58 Ni, 58 Ni +62 Ni,\n58\nNi + 46 Ti) from Refs. [9, 26, 27] could be explained using the moment of inertia calculated at Rint . This shows\nthe possibility of the existence of super- and hyper- deformation in this mass region, as it was predicted thirty\nyears ago [28]. The authors of Ref. [28] concluded their\npaper: \"The outstanding problem is to devise methods\nthat would identify the presence of such superdeformed\nnuclei which in some existing experiments have been produced without having been detected\". Meanwhile experimental methods to evidence the existence of such nuclei\nhave been developed. One should notice results of recent\nexperiments providing information on nuclear deformation in the mass region close to the mass of the di-nuclear\nsystems studied in the present paper, which appears to\nbe a very interesting one from this point of view.\nFor example light charge particle spectra emitted by\n56\nNi and 44 Ti compound nuclei could be described by\nusing in formula (1) of the yrast line an effective moment of inertia Jef f = Jsphere (1+\u03b41 J 2 + \u03b42 J 4 ), where\n\u03b41 , \u03b42 are the deformability parameters and Jsphere is the\nrigid body moment of inertia [29, 30]. For deformability\nparameter values deduced from the fit of experimental\nspectra, one obtaines for the effective moment of inertia\nJef f = 1.4Jsphere and Jef f = 1.5Jsphere for the 56 Ni\nand 44 Ti CN, respectively. Eq. (2) obtained for the dinucleus 54 Fe is similar to these relations. The relative\nmomentum of inertia at break-up obtained by us can be\nalso seen as an effective momentum introduced in order\nto reproduce the experimental periodicity of EAF.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectrum from the decay of GDR built in\nhot 46 Ti was recently measured and its shape suggests\nthe presence of an elongated 3-axial equilibrium shape\nfor this nucleus at J=30h\u0304 [31, 32]. The excitation functions for the system 19 F + 27 Al (di-nucleus 46 Ti) have\n\nbeen constructed for TKEL windows centered at 20 and\n30 MeV. One can see from Fig. 4(a) that for these\nTKEL windows (TKE = 50 - 55 MeV and 40 - 45 MeV,\nrespectively) correspond angular momentum values near\nthe region where very elongated shapes could appear.\nThus, one can consider the analysis of the cross section EFs as a robust experimental method to evidence\nand extract information on such elongated objects. The\nresults obtained in the present paper and in the previous\nones [7, 11, 12], using this method, evidence a large deformation of composite systems formed in the first stage\nof elastic, inelastic scatering and deep inelastic processes\nin the mass region 36 - 56.\n\n[1] A.

The correlation width of the fluctuations extracted\nfrom cross section EF is equal to (115\u00b129) keV to which\ncoresponds a DNS lifetime of (5.7 \u00b1 2.2)*10\u221221sec. The\nlarge channel cross correlation coefficients show the nonstatistical origin of the fluctuations. They support a reaction mechanism where special states of rotational (molecular) nature play the role of doorway configurations towards a regime characterized by stochastic exchange of\nnucleons between interacting nuclei as the main mechanism behind the dissipative phneomena in light heavy\nion collisions.\n27\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the operating crew of LNS Tandem\naccelerator for the quality of delivered beam.
