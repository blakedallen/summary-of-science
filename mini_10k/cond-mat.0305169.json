In\nparticular, although multideterminantal CI like methods\ncould be in principle very accurate, in practice the determinantal expansion becomes heavier and heavier from\nthe computational point of view, as the number of determinants dramatically increases with the complexity of\nthe electron system. On the other hand, a single determinantal wavefunction, kernel of methods like Hartree\u2013Fock\n(HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT), is sometimes not sufficient to describe strongly correlated systems, as for instance the transition metal compounds and\nthe near degenerate shell structure of some atoms.\nSince 50's, the intensive efforts to explain theoretically\nthe superconductivity have been highlighting the role of\npairing in the electronic structure. The BCS wavefunction belongs to an original ansatz in which the correlation\nis introduced through the product of pairing functions (in\nthis context called Cooper pairs), already exploited in\nquantum chemistry by the pioneering work of Hurley et\nal. [1] to treat correlation effects in molecular properties.\nTheir wavefunction was called antisymmetrized geminal\npower (AGP) that has been shown to be the particle\u2013\nconserving version of the BCS ansatz [2]. It includes the\nsingle determinantal wavefunction, i.e. the uncorrelated\nstate, as a special case and introduces correlation effects\nin a straightforward way, through the expansion of the\npairing function (geminal): therefore it was studied as a\npossible alternative to the other multideterminantal approaches. Although this ansatz seemed so appealing, it\n\nled to some expensive optimization procedures [3, 4] with\nnumerical problems [5, 6] in particular when applied to\nlarge systems, and so it turned out to be non competitive\nwith respect to HF and CI.\nWe show in this paper that the use of Monte Carlo\nmethods can overcome the previous difficulties in optimizing the AGP wavefunctions. Two of the most appealing features of these techniques are the possibility to\ntackle in a smart way the many\u2013body interacting problem, having the freedom in the choice of the functional\nform of the wavefunction, and to implement very efficient projection algorithms, like diffusion Monte Carlo\n(DMC) and Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC). The\ntrial wavefunction used in these methods is obtained by\nmultiplying an antisymmetric term (usually called Slater\nterm) to a Jastrow factor, which correlates the electrons\nand takes into account the interelectron cusp conditions\nthe true wavefunction must fulfill. The Slater term can\nbe either HF or CI or AGP like. As already pointed out\nby Umrigar [7], the rate of convergence of CI expansion\nis increased by the Jastrow factor, just because it allows\nthe wavefunction to have the correct cusps, otherwise\npresent only asymptotically in the linear combination of\ndeterminants.\nIn this paper we study the AGP\u2013Jastrow (AGP + J)\nwavefunction, applied to the atomic problem. The wavefunction we consider is actually a Resonating Valence\nBond (RVB) state, first investigated in 1973 by Anderson [8, 9] to study the high\u2013temperature superconductivity and later applied by Bouchaud and Lhuillier [10]\nin Monte Carlo calculations of liquid 3 He. It is remarkable that this kind of wavefunction can describe well the\nground state of all the atoms studied here, in particular those light atoms affected by nondynamic correlation.\nMoreover, the Jastrow part is crucial not only in reducing\n\n\f2\nthe pairing expansion but also in inducing a significant\nimprovement of the nodal surfaces of the wavefunction,\nonce we optimize both the Jastrow and the determinantal part at the same time. The minimization of the total\nenergy can be efficiently performed by using an optimization procedure based upon the Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) method [11], which allows us to determine a\nlarge number of variational parameters, both for the Jastrow and the determinantal part. Due to the simplicity\nof the AGP + J wavefunction and its capability to take\ninto account resonating Slater configurations, this wavefunction is expected to be appropriate also for molecules\nand more complex systems.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we define the wavefunction, in Sec. III we describe the energy\nminimization method and finally in Sec. IV and V we\npresent detailed results and conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nwhere the index i ranges from 1 to N \u2191 .\nThe pairing function can be expanded over a basis of\nsingle particle orbitals [16]:\n\nFUNCTIONAL FORM OF THE WAVE\nFUNCTION\n\nThe wavefunction we used in our QMC calculations is\nthe antisymmetrized product of geminals (AGP ), multiplied by a simple symmetric Jastrow factor:\n\u03a8(r1 , . . . , rN ) = \u03a8AGP (r1 , . . . , rN )J(r1 , . . . , rN ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the origin of the reference frame is the nuclear\nposition. The two parts of the wavefunction (1) will be\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nA.\n\nThe determinantal part\n\nLet \u03a6 be the pairing function (geminal) which takes\ninto account the correlation between two electrons with\nopposite spin. If the system is unpolarized and the state\nis a spin singlet, the AGP wavefunction is\n\u03a8AGP (r1 , . . . , rN ) =\n\n\u00c2[\u03a6(r\u21911 , r\u21932 )\u03a6(r\u21913 , r\u21934 ) * * * \u03a6(r\u2191N \u22121 , r\u2193N )],\n\n(2)\nwhere \u00c2 is an operator that antisymmetrizes the product\nin the square brackets and the geminal is a singlet:\n1\n\u03a6(r\u2191 , r\u2193 ) = \u03c6(r\u2191 , r\u2193 ) \u221a (| \u2191\u2193i \u2212 | \u2193\u2191i) ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nimplying that \u03c6(r, r\u2032 ) is symmetric under a permutation\nof its variables. Given this conditions, one can prove [14]\nthat the spatial part of the \u03a8AGP can be written in a\nvery compact form:\n\u03a8AGP (r1 , . . . , rN ) = det(Aij ),\nwhere Aij is a\n\nN\n2\n\n\u00d7\n\nN\n2\n\n(4)\n\nmatrix defined as:\n\nAij = \u03c6(r\u2191i , r\u2193j ).\n\nWe are going to extend the definition of the geminal\nwavefunction to a polarized system, i.e. a system with\na different number of electrons for each spin. This generalization of the geminal model was first proposed by\nColeman [15] and called GAGP . Without loss of generality, one can assume that the number of up particles\n(N \u2191 ) is greater than the down ones (N \u2193 ). In order to\nwrite down the many\u2013body wavefunction with the geminals, one needs to introduce N \u2191 \u2212 N \u2193 single particle spin\norbitals \u03a6j not associated with any geminal and holding\nunpaired electrons. Once again one recovers the compact\nnotation (4) for the spatial part of \u03a8AGP (see Appendix),\nbut this time Aij is a N \u2191 \u00d7 N \u2191 matrix defined in the following way:\n(\n\u03c6(r\u2191i , r\u2193j )\nfor j = 1, N \u2193\nAij =\n(6)\n\u03c6j (r\u2191i )\nfor j = N \u2193 + 1, N \u2191\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c6(r\u2191 , r\u2193 ) =\n\nM\nX\n\n\u03bbi \u03c8i (r\u2191 )\u03c8i\u2217 (r\u2193 ),\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c8i are general real or complex normalized functions and \u03bbi are variational parameters that may depend\non the chosen spatial symmetry of the geminal. Hereafter, for simplicity, we do not assume that the orbitals\nare mutually orthogonal.\nFor the application to atoms, in order the wavefunction\n\u03a8 has a definite angular momentum, it is convenient that\nthe geminal is rotationally invariant around the nucleus.\nThis requirement is achieved by taking the generic orbital\n\u03c8i to be an eigenfunction of the single particle angular\nmomentum operators l2 and lz ; hence, the orbital will be\ndenoted by:\n\u03c8nlm (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = Rnl (r)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Ylm are spherical harmonics with standard notations and the radial part Rnl depends on the principal\nquantum number n. In this way, the atomic geminal\nfunction takes the form:\n\u03c6(r\u2191 , r\u2193 ) =\n\nl\nX X\n\n\u2217\n\u03bbnl (\u22121)m \u03c8nlm (r\u2191 )\u03c8nlm\n(r\u2193 ).\n\n(9)\n\nnl m=\u2212l\n\nIn the polarized case, the remaining orbitals \u03c8 j may\nchange the total angular momentum and spin quantum\nnumbers with the same rules valid for Slater-type wavefunctions. Within our ansatz it is therefore possible to\nhave definite total spin and angular momenta at least in\nall cases when the conventional Slater function does.\nThe minimal geminal expansion is for M = N \u2193 , then\nthe AGP wavefunction is reduced to the HF one; instead,\nif M is greater than N \u2193 , one can prove that the AGP is\n\n\f3\nequivalent to a linear combination of many Slater determinants. Therefore, within this functional form, one\nis able to introduce the correlation in the determinantal\npart of the wavefunction just by adding some terms in\nthe geminal expansion. For a two\u2013electrons closed\u2013shell\nsystem, like Helium atom, or an ensemble of such noninteracting systems, this wavefunction is exact. For the\nother atoms, we will show that the AGP + J wavefunction can lead to very good variational energies, even in\nthe cases where the HF approximation is rather poor,\nespecially for light elements.\nIn order to optimize the radial part Rnl of the the single\nparticle orbitals, we expand these radial functions in a\nSlater basis, in close analogy with Roothaan\u2013Hartree\u2013\nFock calculations [17], namely using functions of the type:\nrn\u22121 e\u2212zk r\n\n(10)\n\nwith n \u2265 1, taking in principle as many different zk 's as\nrequired for convergence.\nIn the Roothaan\u2013Hartree\u2013Fock the coefficients of the\nlinear combinations are more involved, since the orthogonality among all single particle states is required. In\nthe Monte Carlo approach we have found that it is much\nsimpler and more efficient to deal with non-orthogonal orbitals, without spoiling the accuracy of the calculation.\nIn fact, for light elements with Z \u2264 15, studied here, it\nis possible to obtain almost converged results by using\nonly two exponentials for each radial component (double\nzeta).\nHence, our single particle orbitals read in general\nRnl (r) = Crn\u22121 (e\u2212z1 r + pe\u2212z2 r ),\n\nwhere p is another variational parameter and C is the\nnormalization factor for the radial part Rnl :\n\n\u0011\u2212 12\n\u0010\n1\n\u2212(2n+1)\n\u2212(2n+1)\n\u2212(2n+1)\nC=p\n.\n(2z1 )\n+ 2p(z1 + z2 )\n+ p2 (2z2 )\n(2n)!\nActually p is not free for all the orbitals: indeed, for\na more accurate variational wavefunction, we impose the\nelectron\u2013nucleus cusp condition [18, 19], which is satisfied\nby the exact many body ground state and implies that\neach orbital must fulfill the following relation:\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0302\n= \u2212Z\u03c8\n\u2202r\n\n(13)\n\nat r = 0 (the hat denotes the spherical average). That\ncondition is automatically obeyed by all but 1s and 2s orbitals of the type given in Eq.11. Instead, the parameter\np of 1s orbital must be:\nz1 \u2212 Z\np=\n,\nZ \u2212 z2\n\n\u03c82s (r) = e\u2212z1 r + (p + \u03b1r)e\u2212z2 r ,\n\n(15)\n\n(12)\n\nThe Jastrow factor\n\nThe Jastrow factor in our wave function is very simple and has been widely used in previous Monte Carlo\nelectronic structure calculations:\nY\nJ(r1 , . . . , rN ) =\nexp (f (ri , rj ))\n(17)\ni<j\n\nwhere the product is over all pairs of electrons and for\nsimplicity the function f depends only on their relative\ndistance rij and their spins \u03c3i and \u03c3j , namely:\nbody (rij )\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a further variational parameter and p is given\nby\nz1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 Z\n.\np=\nZ \u2212 z2\n\nB.\n\nftwo\n\nand for the 2s state, in order to fulfill Eq. (13), we choose\na functional form of the type:\n\n(11)\n\n=\n\na\u03c3i \u03c3j rij\n.\n1 + b\u03c3i \u03c3j rij\n\n(18)\n\nThe value of a\u03c3i \u03c3j is fixed by the cusp condition at the\ncoalescence points of two electrons and b\u03c3i \u03c3j contains at\nmost three free variational parameters, as b\u2191\u2193 = b\u2193\u2191 is implied by the spatial symmetry of the Jastrow factor. The\ncusp conditions for parallel and antiparallel spin electrons\nare different and yield two different values of a\u03c3i \u03c3j :\na=\n\n1\nfor \u03c3i = \u03c3j\n2\n\n(19a)\n\na=\n\n1\nfor \u03c3i 6= \u03c3j .\n4\n\n(19b)\n\n(16)\n\nIn our study, we found that the presence of the \u03b1 term\nleads to a very marginal improvement of the variational\nwavefunction, therefore we set \u03b1 = 0 and we kept the\n1s and 2s orbitals to have the same functional form, in\norder to reduce at most the total number of parameters.\n\nAs pointed out in Ref. 20, whenever a\u03c3i \u03c3j or b\u03c3i \u03c3j depend on the electron spins \u03c3i \u03c3j , the wavefunction will\nbe spin contaminated, i.e. it will not be an eigenstate of\n\n\f4\nthe total spin operator S 2 . We have chosen to preserve\nthe correct spin symmetry of the total wavefunction, by\nkeeping a\u03c3i \u03c3j = 1/2 and b\u03c3i \u03c3j = b, hence fulfilling only\nthe first condition (19a). Indeed, the cusp condition for\nelectrons with parallel spins is much less important because their probability to get close is clearly small, due\nto the Pauli principle.\nFor the nitrogen atom, we checked the quality of this\nwavefunction with respect to a spin contaminated one\nwith two variational parameters, b\u2191\u2191 = b\u2193\u2193 = b1 and\nb\u2191\u2193 = b2 , both of them reported in Table III, listed with\nthe other atoms. In both the cases, we kept the geminal expansion to be minimal (HF + J like wavefunction).\nAs reported in Table I, the improvement in energy obtained by contaminating the spin wavefunction is rather\nnegligible, and disappears when the FN DMC simulation\nis carried out. This implies that it is possible to obtain\nalmost optimal nodes, without spoiling the spin symmetry and by using only one variational parameter for the\nJastrow factor.\nIn order to study the effectiveness of the Jastrow for\na more accurate determination of the nodal surface, we\nhave implemented a more involved Jastrow factor, including three-body correlation terms, and we have applied it\nto few atoms (Be and M g). Indeed the Jastrow term f\nin Eq. 17 is a general function of the positions of two\nelectrons and it has been parametrized similarly to the\ngeminal function (7), but truncated up to the l = 1 angular momentum:\nf (ri , rj ) = ftwo\n\nbody (rij )\n\n+\n\n\u03c80 (ri )\u03c80 (rj ) + \u03c8 1 (ri ) * \u03c8 1 (rj ).\n\n(20)\n\nThe functional form for the s-wave (\u03c80 ) and p-wave (\u03c8 1 )\ncomponents can be chosen among different types; the\nmost widely used in the literature are the polynomial\n[21, 22] and the gaussian\u2013polynomial mixed form [23].\nIn this work, we have selected the expansion over a gaussian basis, as reported in Table V. This parametrization\nof the Jastrow factor, though being certainly less general\ncompared with the best possible ones [24], includes the\nmost significant part of the three-body correlation [25],\nwhich involves two electrons and the nuclei. Our purpose, in fact, is to check whether it is possible to lower\nsignificantly the energy of the AGP + J wavefunction,\nwhenever the Jastrow part of the wavefunction is systematically improved together with the determinantal part.\nIII.\nA.\n\nMETHOD\n\nMinimization method\n\nWe have performed the wavefunction optimization by\nusing the stochastic minimization of the total energy\nbased upon the Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) technique, already exploited for lattice systems [11]. Let\n\u03a8T (\u03b10 ) be the wavefunction depending on an initial set\n\nof p variational parameters {\u03b10k }k=1,...,p . Consider now\na small variation of the parameters \u03b1k = \u03b10k + \u03b4\u03b1k . The\ncorresponding wavefunction \u03a8T (\u03b1) is equal, within the\nvalidity of the linear expansion, to the following one:\np\n\u0010\nX\n\u03a8\u2032T (\u03b1) = \u03a8T (\u03b10 ) +\n\u03b4\u03b1k\nk=1\n\n\u0011\n\u2202\n\u03a8T (\u03b10 )\n\u2202\u03b1k\n\n(21)\n\nTherefore, by introducing local operators defined on each\nconfiguration x = {r1 , . . . , rN } as the logarithmic derivatives with respect to the variational parameters:\nOk (x) =\n\n\u2202\nln \u03a8T (x)\n\u2202\u03b1k\n\n(22)\n\nand for convenience the identity operator O0 = 1, we can\nwrite \u03a8\u2032T in a more compact form:\n|\u03a8\u2032T (\u03b1)i\n\n=\n\np\nX\n\nk=0\n\n\u03b4\u03b1k Ok |\u03a8T i,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere |\u03a8T i = |\u03a8T (\u03b10 )i and \u03b4\u03b10 = 1. In general, \u03b4\u03b10 6=\n1, in that case the variation of the parameters will be\nscaled\n\u03b4\u03b1k \u2192\n\n\u03b4\u03b1k\n\u03b4\u03b10\n\n(24)\n\nk\nand \u03a8\u2032T will be proportional to \u03a8T (\u03b1) for small \u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4\u03b10 .\nOur purpose is to set up an iterative scheme to reach\nthe minimum possible energy for the parameters \u03b1, exploiting the linear approximation for \u03a8T (\u03b1), which will\nbecome more and more accurate close to the convergence, when the variation of the parameters is smaller\nand smaller. We follow the stochastic reconfiguration\nmethod and define\n\n|\u03a8\u2032T i = PSR (\u039b \u2212 H)|\u03a8T i\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u039b is a suitable large shift, allowing \u03a8\u2032T to have a\nlower energy than \u03a8T [11], and PSR is a projection operator over the (p + 1)\u2013dimensional subspace, spanned by\nthe basis {Ok |\u03a8T i}k=0,...,p , over which the function |\u03a8\u2032T i\nhas been expanded (Eq. 23). Indeed, in order to determine the coefficients {\u03b4\u03b1k }k=1,...,p corresponding to \u03a8\u2032T\ndefined in Eq.25, one needs to solve the SR conditions:\nh\u03a8T |Ok (\u039b \u2212 H)|\u03a8T i = h\u03a8T |Ok |\u03a8\u2032T i for k = 0, . . . , p\n(26)\nthat can be rewritten in a linear system:\nX\n\u03b4\u03b1l slk = f k ,\n(27)\nl\n\nwhere slk = h\u03a8T |Ol Ok |\u03a8T i is the covariance matrix and\nf k = h\u03a8T |Ok (\u039b \u2212 H)|\u03a8T i is the known term; both slk\nand f k are computed stochastically by a Monte Carlo\nintegration. These linear equations (27) are very similar\nto the ones introduced by Filippi and Fahy [26] for the\n\n\f5\nenergy minimization of the Slater part. In our formulation, there is no difficulty to optimize the Jastrow and\nthe Slater part of the wavefunction at the same time.\nAfter the system (27) has been solved, we update the\nvariational parameters\n(0)\n\n\u03b1k = \u03b1k +\n\n\u03b4\u03b1k\nfor k = 1, . . . , p\n\u03b4\u03b10\n\n(28)\n\nand we obtain a new trial wavefunction \u03a8T (\u03b1). By\nrepeating this iteration scheme several times, one apk\nproaches the convergence when \u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4\u03b10 \u2192 0 for k 6= 0, and\nin this limit the SR conditions (26) implies the Euler\nequations of the minimum energy. Obviously, the solution of the linear system (27) is affected by statistical\nerrors, yielding statistical fluctuations of the final variational parameters \u03b1k even when convergence has been\nreached, namely when the {\u03b1k }k=1,...,p fluctuate without\ndrift around an average value. We perform several iterations in that regime; in this way, the variational parameters can be determined more accurately by averaging\nthem over all these iterations and by evaluating also the\ncorresponding statistical error bars.\nIt is worth noting that the solution of the linear system\n(27) depends on \u039b only through the \u03b4\u03b10 variable. Therefore the constant \u039b indirectly controls the rate of change\nin the parameters at each step, i.e. the speed of the algorithm for convergence and the stability at equilibrium:\na too small value will produce uncontrolled fluctuations\nfor the variational parameters, a too large one will allow convergence in an exceedingly large number of iterations. The choice of \u039b can be controlled by evaluating\nthe change of the wavefunction at each step as:\nX\n\u2032\n|\u03a8\u2032T \u2212 \u03a8T |2\n=\n\u03b4\u03b1k \u03b4\u03b1k\u2032 skk\n|\u03a8T |2\n\u2032\n\n(29)\n\nk,k >0\n\nBy keeping this value small enough during the optimization procedure, one can easily obtain a steady and\nstable convergence.\nFinally, we mention that the stochastic procedure is\nable in principle to perform a global optimization, as discussed in Ref. 11 for the SR and in Ref. 12 for the\nStochastic Gradient Approximation (SGA), because the\nnoise in the sampling can avoid the dynamics of the parameters to get stuck into local minima.\n\nB.\n\nVariational and Diffusion Monte Carlo\n\nWe performed standard Variational (VMC) and Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), the latter within the so called\nFixed Node (FN) approximation, which allows to obtain\nthe lowest energy state with the same nodes of a trial\nwavefunction. As trial state for FN, we have used the\nVMC wavefunction optimized with the SR method described in the previous section.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe have carried out Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for atoms from Li to P , using the antisymmetrized\ngeminal power times the Jastrow factor (AGP + J) to\ndescribe the atomic electronic structure. We performed\nthe optimization of both the geminal and the Jastrow\npart minimizing the energy with the method described\nin Sec.III. For all the atoms, we considered the minimal\ngeminal expansion, corresponding to the HF single determinant, and the simplest Jastrow factor with a single\nparameter (18), reported in Table III. To improve the\nantisymmetric part, we increased the number of orbitals\nin the geminal expansion, and for Be and M g atoms\nwe also systematically considered an improved Jastrow\nterm, such as the three-body one described above (see\nTables IV and V). As one can notice from the Tables,\nour wavefunction parametrization is very compact, even\nin the case of the mostly correlated states, since it contains always a relatively small number of parameters for\neach atom.\nIn order to judge the outcome of our calculations, we\ncomputed the correlation energies and in particular its\nfraction with respect to the exact ground state energy\nfor the nonrelativistic infinite nuclear mass Hamiltonian,\nestimated in Ref. 13. The quality of the variational wavefunction can be seen by computing the expectation value\nof the energy by means of the VMC calculations. Furthermore, we carried out DMC simulations within the FN\napproximation, which allows to optimize the amplitude of\nthe wavefunction inside each nodal volume, where its sign\nis given and fixed by the variational state. Therefore, the\nDMC energy depends on the quality of the nodal structure of the variational wavefunction and the capability\nof improving the nodes during the optimization is crucial to obtain almost exact DMC energy values. To that\npurpose, it is very important to have a variational functional form appropriate to reproduce the correct nodes.\nWe show that the AGP + J wavefunction satisfies well\nthis requirement, yielding in all the atoms studied here\nvery good DMC results. The VMC and DMC energies\nare listed in Table I; in Figures 1 and 2 we plot the percentage of the correlation energy recovered respectively\nby VMC and DMC calculations for different atoms and\nwavefunctions.\nThe VMC calculations with the minimal geminal expansion and the two body Jastrow factor yield from 60%\nto 68% of the total correlation energy, with the exception\nof the Li atom, where 91.4% of the correlation energy\nis obtained. Therefore, there is a sizable loss of accuracy in going from Li to Be, the worst case being the\nBoron atom. The corresponding DMC simulations get a\nlarge amount of the energy missing in the VMC calculations, recovering from 87.7% to 99.9% of the total correlation energy, but the dependence on the atomic number shows the same behavior found in VMC: the worst\nresults are obtained for Be, B and C atoms, due to the\nstrong multiconfigurational nature of their ground states.\n\n\f6\nAs well known, one can improve substantially the variational state of those atoms including not only the 1s2 2s2\nconfiguration but also the 2s2 2p2 , because of the near degeneracy of 2s and 2p orbitals. In this case the AGP + J\nansatz is particularly efficient: by adding just one term\nin the geminal expansion, we are able to remove this loss\nof accuracy in the correlation energy both in the VMC\nand the DMC calculations.\nIn Table II, we summarize some results obtained for\nBe in previous works and compare them with ours. AGP\ncalculations of atoms have been performed only few times\nso far, the best one for Be is reported in the last row of\nthe Table II. Kurtz et al. [27] were able to recover 84%\nof correlation energy using a geminal expansion with a\nvery large basis; our variational AGP + J wavefunction\nreaches 94% with a much smaller basis (1s, 2s and 2p orbitals). By including a three-body Jastrow factor, 97.5%\nof the correlation energy is finally obtained, which is comparable with the best multiconfigurational wavefunctions\npreviously studied [24].\nThis outcome highlights the importance of the Jastrow\nin reducing the geminal expansion and yielding a better\nenergy. The nodal surface can be substantially improved\nwith the present approach, because the pairing expansion contains implicitly not only the four determinants\n1s2 2s2 and 1s2 2p2 , but also the other three 2s2 2p2 and\nsix 2p2 2p2 , which can improve further the wavefunction.\nIndeed, the geminal expansion reduces exactly to four\ndeterminants in the limit \u03bb2s \u2192 0 and \u03bb2p \u2192 0 with\n2s\n. The fact that the minimum energy is\nconstant ratio \u03bb\u03bb2p\nobtained for \u03bb2s 6= 0 and \u03bb2p 6= 0 (see Tables IV and V)\nclearly shows that the energy can be lowered by considering the remaining configurations described above. Indeed our DMC energies are slightly lower than the ones\nby Huang et al.[24], to our knowledge the best available\nones obtained with the four determinants: one 1s2 2s2\nand three 1s2 2p2 . In order to determine accurate nodes\nfor the corresponding DMC calculation they used the\ntwo-body Jastrow factor similar to the one (18) we used\nor an highly involved three-body term much more complete than ours (for this reason our corresponding VMC\nenergy is slightly worse in this case). We also verified,\ntherefore, that a more accurate description of the Jastrow factor (which do not affect directly the nodes) is\ncrucial to obtain better nodes, provided the variational\nparameters, belonging to both the Jastrow and the determinantal part, are optimized altogether. For instance,\nin Ref. 22 the authors optimized only the coefficients in\nfront of the four determinants 1s2s \u2212 1s2p and not the\norbitals, obtaining for Be energy not comparable with\nthe best possible ones. The AGP + J is simple enough to\nallow a feasible parametrization of the variational state,\nby capturing the most important correlation.\nWe found that also M g, Al and Si, the second row\natoms corresponding to Be, B and C in the first row,\nhave a quite strong multiconfigurational character, involving here 3s and 3p orbitals. Analogously to the\nBeryllium case, for the M g we have optimized both the\n\ntwo-body and the three-body Jastrow factor, together\nwith the AGP wavefunction containing 3s\u20133p resonance.\nIn this case, although at the variational level the threebody wavefunction is much better than the two-body one\n(see Fig. 1), that difference disappears almost completely\nin the DMC results. This shows that the correction of\nthe nodal surface allowed by the more accurate threebody Jastrow does not seem to be crucial as in the Be\natom. On the other hand, the effect of the AGP expansion is significant in improving further the DMC calculation, which already yields good FN energies even with a\nsimple HF + J trial wavefunction for atoms heavier than\nC (percentage of correlation energy always greater than\n92%). By adding the 3p contribution to the geminal we\nwere able to recover 96.8% of the correlation energy of\nM g (see Fig. 2). Also for Al the presence of the 3p orbital is significant in reducing the DMC energy, and for\nSi it seems important only in the VMC value.\nFinally, by using the AGP + J wavefunction, we optimized some atoms (from N to N a) not affected by nondynamic correlation; here, in order to obtain an improvement in the VMC and in the DMC energies, we needed\na bigger basis (3s2p1d) to be used in the geminal expansion.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn this work we have introduced a variational wavefunction which contains the main ingredients of electron\ncorrelations: the Jastrow factor, that allows to satisfy the\nelectron\u2013electron cusp condition, and the geminal expansion, that allows to consider a correlated multiconfiguration state, with a numerically feasible scheme, namely by\nevaluating only a single but appropriately defined determinant.\nThe application to atoms is particularly successful for\nlow atomic number, where Hartree-Fock is particularly\npoor, due to the almost degenerate 2s \u2212 2p shells. The\ncase of Beryllium is an interesting benchmark. Indeed,\nby considering the change of the geminal part altogether\nwith the Jastrow term, we obtained an excellent representation of this correlated atom. Our results, presented\nin Table II, are not only comparable but appear even\nbetter than the best multideterminantal schemes (using\ne.g. four Slater determinants), showing that it is possible\nto represent non trivial correlated states by properly taking into account the interplay of the Jastrow term and\nthe determinantal part of the wavefunction. Our variational energies for the other atoms (see Table I) can\nbe substantially lowered because we have considered, in\nthis first application, a wavefunction with the two-body\nJastrow factor.\nAs well known the variational energy of the HartreeFock wavefunction cannot be improved by extending\nthe variational calculation to a larger basis including\nall particle-hole excitations applied to the Hartree-Fock\nstate. Analogously, the geminal wavefunction is not only\n\n\f7\nstable with respect to these particle-hole configurations\n, but also to all possible states obtained by destroying a singlet pair on some orbital and creating another\none on another orbital. Though this wavefunction can\ntake into account a big number of configurations which\nmay allow an energy improvement, obviously it cannot\ninclude everything within a single geminal, otherwise\nthe wavefunction would be exact. Indeed there exist\nmulticonfigurational states that are known to be important for atoms like C or those with larger Z [29], and\nthat involve complicated multi\u2013particle excitations to the\nHartree-Fock state. These ones cannot be reduced to creation/destruction of singlet pairs and therefore cannot be\nhandled with a single geminal function. However in our\nstudy we have found that the single geminal function\nwith the proper Jastrow factor already provides satisfactory results for all atoms, yielding more than 93% of the\ncorrelation energy in all cases studied by carrying out\nDMC simulations.\n\nThe extension of this approach to molecules or more\ncomplex electronic systems is straightforward, and is indeed particularly promising. As pointed out in Ref. 28,\nthe geminal wavefunction for a diatomic system can correctly describe the interatomic Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential from small to large distances, where, in this limit,\nthe wavefunction of isolated atoms can be smoothly recovered. This important property cannot be satisfied\nwithin the Hartree-Fock theory, even for the simplest H2\nmolecule (without contaminating the singlet ground state\nwavefunction).\n\nFor an electronic system with many atoms, the geminal expansion together with the Jastrow term is very\nsimilar to the so called Resonating Valence Bond (RVB)\nexpansion, introduced by Pauling (see e.g. [30]) long time\nago, and revived recently by P.W. Anderson to consider\nthe properties of strongly correlated electronic systems.\nThe geminal part, when expanded in terms of Slater determinants, yields a very large and non trivial number\nof configurations, which increases exponentially with the\nnumber of atoms considered. The Jastrow factor in this\ncase suppresses the weight of those configurations with\ntwo electrons close to the same atomic orbital, correctly\ndescribing the effect of the strong Coulomb repulsion. We\nsee therefore the remarkable advantage of this approach.\nJust for complex systems with many atoms an RVB wavefunction corresponding to an exponentially large number\nof configurations can be efficiently used for a more accurate description of electron correlation. Contrary to\nthe conventional RVB expansion, it is appealing , not\nonly from the computational point of view, that these\nproperties can be obtained by sampling a single determinant wavefunction within the Quantum Monte Carlo\ntechniques.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Saverio Moroni, for having\nprovided us unpublished work on the Neon atom, and\nClaudia Filippi for useful comments on the preliminary\nversion of the manuscript.

To this purpose we introduce\nsecond quantized fermionic fields (see e.g. Fetter and\nWalecka [31]) \u03c8 \u2020 (r, \u03c3) and \u03c8(r, \u03c3), where r is the electron position and \u03c3 = \u00b11/2 is its spin projection along\nthe z\u2013axis. These fields satisfy the canonical anticommutation rules:\n\b\n(A.1)\n\u03c8(r, \u03c3), \u03c8 \u2020 (r\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) = \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ).\n\nIn these notations, the most general wavefunction with\ndefinite spin can be formally written in the following way:\n\n|\u03a8i = PN\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\n\u2020\n\u03c8i,\u2191\nexp(\u03a6\u2020 )|0i,\n\n(A.2)\n\ni=N\u2193 +1\n\nwhere PN is the projection on the given number of particles N = N\u2191 + N\u2193 , |0i denotes the vacuum of electrons\n\u2020\nand \u03c8i,\u2191\nis the most generic (Bogoliubov) orbital with\nspin S = 1/2:\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2020\n>\n\u2020\n\u03c8i,\u2191 = dr \u03c6<\n(A.3)\ni (r)\u03c8(r, \u2193) + \u03c6i (r)\u03c8 (r, \u2191) ,\n\nwhich is defined by the orbital functions \u03c6>\ni for the creation of a particle with spin up and \u03c6<\ni for the annihilation of a particle with spin down. For instance, a conventional Slater determinant of spin-up particles can be\nQ \u2020\n|0i, where \u03c6<\nwritten as i \u03c8i,\u2191\ni = 0. It is clear therefore\nthat this representation is more general and may provide\na wavefunction \u03a8 much more reach than the conventional\nSlater determinants.\nFinally, the pairing creation operator \u03a6\u2020 is a singlet,\nnamely exp(\u03a6\u2020 )|0i has spin zero, and is defined by a\ngeneric symmetric function \u03a6(r, r\u2032 ) = \u03a6(r\u2032 , r):\nZ\nZ\n\u03a6\u2020 = dr dr\u2032 \u03a6(r\u2032 , r)\u03c8 \u2020 (r, \u2193)\u03c8 \u2020 (r\u2032 , \u2191).\n(A.4)\nOur purpose is to show here that the value of the\nwavefunction \u03a8 can be simply computed, similarly to\n\n\f8\na conventional Slater determinant, on each configuration\nx = {r1,\u2191 , . . . , rN\u2193 ,\u2193 }, where ri,\u2191 are the positions of spin\u2013\nup particles and ri,\u2193 are the spin\u2013down ones. These configurations can be generally written as:\nhx| = h0|\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c8(ri , \u2191)\n\nN\u2193\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u03c8(rj , \u2193).\n\nF = hx|\u03a8i =\n\n*\n\n0\n\n(A.5)\n\nY\ni\n\n\u03c8(ri , \u2191)\n\nY\nj\n\nNow we insert the identity exp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 ) exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) between\neach fermionic field in the above equation (A.6):\nF =\n\nIndeed the value F of the wavefunction on hx| is:\n\n0 exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) exp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8(r1 , \u2191) exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) * * *\n\n* * * exp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8(rN\u2193 , \u2193) exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) * * *\nE\n\u2020\n\u2020\n* * * exp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8N\nexp(\u03a6\n)\n0\n.\n,\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u03c8(rj , \u2193)\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\n\u2020\n\u03c8k,\u2191\n\n\u2020\n\n+\n\nexp(\u03a6 ) 0 .\n\nk=N\u2193 +1\n\n(A.6)\n\nterms in the RHS of Eq. A.8 are always zero beyond\nthe first two. After substituting the expressions in Eq.\nA.7 and by using h0| exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) = h0|, \u03c8(r, \u03c3)|0i = 0 and\nh0|\u03c8 \u2020 (r, \u03c3) = 0, one can iteratively apply the canonical\ncommutation rules (A.1) and a simplified result for F is\nobtained:\n\n(A.7)\n\nExploiting the relation valid for generic operators A, B\nand C:\n1\n[A, [A, B]] + . . .\n2\n(A.8)\none is able to evaluate the following terms:\nexp(\u2212A) B exp(A) = B \u2212 [A, B] +\n\nexp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8(ri , \u2191) exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) =\nZ\n\u03c8(ri , \u2191) \u2212 dr \u03a6(ri,\u2191 , r)\u03c8 \u2020 (r, \u2193)\n\nF =\n\n*\n\n0\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c8(ri , \u2191)\n\nN\u2191\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u0303i,\u2191\n\n0\n\n+\n\n(A.10)\n\n\u2020\nwhere \u03c8\u0303i,\u2191\nis the creator of an orbital function of the type\n(A.3), with transformed orbitals:\n\n\u03c6i (r) = \u03a6(r, ri,\u2193 )\n(A.11a)\nfor i = 1, * * * , N\u2193\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c6\u0304i (r) = \u03c6>\n(r)\n+\ndr\u2032 \u03a6(r, r\u2032 )\u03c6<\ni\ni (r ) (A.11b)\n\nexp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8(ri , \u2193) exp(\u03a6\u2020 ) =\nZ\n\u03c8(ri , \u2193) + dr \u03a6(r, ri,\u2193 )\u03c8 \u2020 (r, \u2191)\n\nfor i = N\u2193 + 1, * * * , N\u2191\n\n\u2020\nexp(\u2212\u03a6\u2020 )\u03c8i,\u2191\nexp(\u03a6\u2020 ) =\n\nIn order to derive the above relations, notice that all the\n\nThen the final value of F can be simply computed by\na single determinant, as it represents just the value of a\nN\u2191 \u00d7N\u2191 Slater determinant with orbitals given in (A.11a)\nand (A.11b) on the spin-up configurations, yielding the\nfinal expression (6) reported in the text.\n\n[1] A.
