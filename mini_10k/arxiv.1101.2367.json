INTRODUCTION\nThe Tully-Fisher relation is very important for\nconstraining galaxy formation models because it\nlinks two fundamental properties of galaxies such as\nthe stellar (sTFR) or baryonic (bTFR) mass and the\ndepth of the potential well.\nIn particular, there are observational evidences\nthat the sTFR does not follow a linear trend for\nthe whole range of observed rotation velocities. According to the results of McGaugh et al. (2000), the\nsTFR bends at \u223c 90 km s\u22121 in such a way that\nsmaller galaxies have lower stellar masses than those\nderived from the extrapolation of the linear fit to fast\nrotators. Moreover, McGaugh et al. (2010) have reported that there is also a bend in the bTFR but at\na lower rotation velocity (\u223c 20 km s\u22121 ).\n2. SIMULATIONS\nIn this work, we studied the role of Supernova (SN) feedback on the shape of the sTFR and\n1 Instituto de Astronom\u0131\u0301a y F\u0131\u0301sica del Espacio, CONICETUBA, CC 67, Suc 28 (1428), Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos\nAires, Argentina (derossi@iafe.uba.ar, alternative address:\nmariaemilia.dr@gmail.com).\n2 Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones\nCient\u0131\u0301ficas y\nT\u00e9cnicas, CONICET, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n3 Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de\nBuenos Aires, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nbTFR by analysing hydrodynamical simulations in\na \u039bCDM universe 4 . A version of the chemical\ncode GADGET-3 including treatments for metaldependent radiative cooling, stochastic star formation and SN feedback (Scannapieco et al. 2006) was\nemployed. The simulated volume corresponds to a\ncubic box of a comoving 10 Mpc h\u22121 side length. The\nsimulation has a mass resolution of 6 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 h\u22121\nand 9 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 h\u22121 for the dark and gas phase, respectively.\nSimulated disc-like galaxies were identified following the methods describe by De Rossi et al.\n(2010). The mean properties of galactic systems\nwere estimated at the baryonic radius Rbar , defined\nas the one which encloses 83 per cent of the baryonic\nmass of the systems. We found that the tangential\nvelocity of these systems constitutes a good representation of their potential well so that, for the sake\nof simplicity, we used the circular velocity estimated\nat Rbar as the kinematical indicator for our study.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe massive-end of the simulated sTFR can be\nfitted by a power-law of the form log(M\u2217 /M\u2299 h\u22121 ) =\n(3.68 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 log(V / 100 km s\u22121 ) +(9.42 \u00b1 0.26),\n4\u03a9\nm = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9b\n100 h\u22121 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 with h = 0.7\n\n=\n\n0.04 and H0\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDE ROSSI, TISSERA, & PEDROSA\n\nin general good agreement with observations. However, at rotation velocities below \u223c 100 km s\u22121 , the\nsTFR becomes steep and the residuals of the linear\nfit depart systematically from zero, consistently with\nthe findings of McGaugh et al. (2000). To analyse\nthe role of SN feedback on the origin of the bend\nof the sTFR, we run a feedback-free simulation. We\nfound that, when SN feedback is suppressed from the\nmodel, the sTFR describes a linear behaviour indicating the crucial role of SNe in the modulation of\nthis relation.\nWith respect to the bTFR, both the SN feedback\nmodel and the feedback-free run show a single slope\nfor the relation at least for the range of velocities\nresolved by these simulations (40 km s\u22121 < V <\n250 km s\u22121 ). These results are not in disagreement\nwith the findings of McGaugh et al. (2010) because\nthey reported a bend in the bTFR at \u223c 20 km s\u22121 .\nBy analysing the simulations at higher redshifts\n(0 < z < 3), we obtained similar trends. We have\nalso checked that our results are robust against numerical resolution. For further details, the reader is\nreferred to De Rossi et al. (2010).\nFinally, we explore how the SN feedback model\nis capable of reproducing these behaviours without\nintroducing scale-dependent parameters. To analyse the impact of galactic outflows in the simulated\ngalaxies, we defined the fraction fbvir as the ratio between the baryonic mass within the virial radius to\nthe one inferred from the universal baryonic fraction\n(\u03a9b /\u03a9m ). In these simulations, fbvir is within the\nrange 0.2 \u2212 0.8 showing that for the whole sample\na significant percentage of the gas in blown away as\na consequence of efficient galactic winds. The more\nprominent losses are obtained for smaller galaxies.\nMoreover, by comparing the SN feedback model\nwith the feedback-free run, we found that SN winds\ngenerate an important decrease in the star formation\nactivity of galaxies with the larger effects in slowrotating systems, consistently with the bend of the\nsTFR. Indeed, our results suggest that the role of\nSN feedback on the regulation of the star formation\nstrongly depends on the mass of the galaxies. In\nparticular, we distinguish two distinct regimes for\nthe thermodynamical transitions of the gas phase.\nIn the case of smaller galaxies, the virial temperatures are lower and SN heating is more efficient\nat promoting gas from a cold to a hot phase (see\nScannapieco et al. 2006 for more details about the\nmodel). However, the cooling times of these systems\nare shorter than the dynamical times and the hot\ngas can return to the cold phase in short time-scales.\nTherefore, for slow-rotators, SN feedback leads to a\n\nself-regulated cycle of heating and cooling strongly\ninfluencing the star formation activity of these systems. In the case of massive galaxies, the hot phase\nis established at a higher temperature and SN heating cannot generate an efficient transition of the gas\nfrom the cold to the hot phase. Meanwhile, the\ncold gas remains available for star formation. On\nthe other hand, the cooling times for these galaxies\nget longer compared to the dynamical times and the\nhot gas is able to remain in the hot phase during\nlonger time-scales. Hence, SN feedback is not efficient at regulating the star formation in larger galaxies. Interestingly, in this model, the transition from\nthe efficient to the inefficient cooling regime for the\nhot-gas phase occurs at the same characteristic rotation velocity where the sTFR bends (\u223c 100 km s\u22121 )\nand is also in agreement with previous observational\n(e.g. McGaugh et al. 2000) and theoretical works\n(Larson 1974; Dekel & Silk 1986).\n4. CONCLUSION\nWe studied the Tully-Fisher relation by performing numerical simulations in a cosmological framework. We obtained a sTFR and a bTFR in general agreement with observations. The SN feedback\nmodel is able to reproduce the observed bend of the\nsTFR at a characteristic velocity of \u223c 100 km s\u22121\nwithout introducing scale dependent parameters.\nWe found that this characteristic velocity separates\ntwo different regimes: slow-rotators develop a selfregulated cycle of efficient SN heating and radiative\ncooling while, in fast-rotators, the cold an hot gasphases seem to be more disconnected.
