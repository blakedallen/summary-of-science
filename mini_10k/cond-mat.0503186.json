Devices are\nrealised with emission at 2.8 THz, displaying ultra low threshold currents of 19 mA at 4K in\na)\n\nsukhdeep.dhillon@thalesgroup.com\n\n1\n\n\fboth pulsed and continuous wave operation. Thanks to the semiconductor material on both\nsides of the active region and to the narrow width of the top metal strip, the thermal\nproperties of these devices have been greatly improved. A decrease of the thermal resistance\nby over a factor of two compared to standard ridge double-metal lasers of similar size has\nbeen measured.\n\nQuantum cascade lasers (QCLs) represent a promising technology towards the\nrealisation of room-temperature semiconductor coherent sources emitting at frequencies\nabove 1 THz1-5. Although room-temperature operation is certainly desirable, in many cases\nthe use of cryogenic equipment does not constitute a major obstacle. For example,\nlightweight, portable closed cycle Stirling coolers are routinely employed to operate quantum\nwell infrared photodetectors at liquid nitrogen temperatures or below6. Typical cooling\npowers for this type of coolers are of a few 100 mW at the lowest temperatures, which can\nrepresent a severe constraint for QCLs, traditionally characterised by rather high power\nconsumption. In this respect, compared to devices emitting in the near and mid-infrared,\nQCLs operating in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum are an exception, owing\nto their much lower threshold current densities. Yet, so far, owing to the large size of the\ndevices imposed by the wavelength, or to high threshold voltages, the operating powers\nreported in the literature are always in excess of ~ 2 W1-5.\n\nIn this work we employ a recently demonstrated bound-to-continuum QCL emitting at\n2.8 THz, characterised by a threshold current density of only 110 A/cm2 at 4K, together with\na threshold voltage of just over 2V4. We take full advantage of these properties by\nincorporating the active region into a buried waveguide scheme based on double-metal\n\n2\n\n\ftechnology7,8. Relying on proton implantation for current confinement, this technology\nallows the fabrication of devices of extremely small size, of the order of the wavelength in\nthe material, with, in addition, considerably improved thermal handling capabilities\ncompared to lasers based on standard ridge-cavities7. With a 500 x 37 \u03bcm device we\ndemonstrate a threshold current of 19 mA in continuous wave at 4K, yielding a dissipated\npower at threshold of ~ 100 mW, which represents a performance record for ridge cavity\nQCLs.\n\nWe have recently demonstrated THz QCL buried waveguides based on surface\nplasmons7. We showed how a surface plasmon mode of finite vertical and lateral dimensions\ncan be bound at the interface between a metal strip and a semiconductor. For a given\nwavelength, the width of the strip controls the degree of spatial confinement, with the optical\nmode expanding progressively inside the semiconductor as the strip width is reduced. By\nexploiting this concept we implemented single-plasmon buried waveguides where a ~ 12 \u03bcm\nthick active region lies on top of a semi-insulating substrate. Here the metal strip forming the\ntop contact metallisation sustains the plasmon mode, which, in turn, strongly leaks inside the\nsubstrate by penetrating through a 700 nm thick, 2\u00d71018 cm-3 n-doped bottom contact GaAs\nlayer. At \u03bb = 100 \u03bcm, we found that strips thinner than ~ 120 \u03bcm could not be used without\nreducing the overlap between the optical mode and the electrically pumped active area,\ntherefore leading to higher threshold current densities. Yet, the advantage of realising even\nthinner laser guides without compromising the overlap would be twofold, yielding (i) devices\noperating at lower currents, and (ii) characterised by a higher heat conductance. This last\npoint stems from the fact that in QCLs the excess heat is more efficiently dissipated in the\ndirection parallel than perpendicular to the hetero layers, thanks to the higher in-plane heat\nconductivity resulting from bulk-like phonon dispersions7,9.\n\n3\n\nTherefore we expect the\n\n\frealisation of devices with a better aspect ratio between lateral and vertical areas (i.e. with\nthinner strip widths) to result in improved thermal handling capabilities.\n\nSo-called double-metal waveguides are particularly suited for the realisation of small\nsurface area THz QCLs3,8. In their original scheme the active region is sandwiched between\ntwo metal layers and the lateral optical and electrical confinement is obtained by etching\nthrough the active region down to the bottom contact layer. In Fig. 1(a) we present our\nalternative approach based on a buried waveguide geometry. Mode intensity calculations,\nbased on a two-dimensional finite element modelling, were performed at \u03bb = 100 \u03bcm, with\ngold as the surface metal. The active region used is described in Ref. [4] and is sandwiched\nbetween 700 nm 2\u00d71018cm-3 and 80 nm 5\u00d71018cm-3 doped layers for the lower and upper\ncontacts, respectively.\n\nAs shown by the 2-D mode intensity plot, sub-wavelength optical confinement is\nachieved despite the total absence of a ridge, with the optical mode confined underneath a\ntop-contact metal strip only 37\u03bcm wide. This results from the double-plasmonic nature of the\noptical mode, bound at both top and bottom metal-semicondctor interfaces, allowing for a\nmuch tighter lateral confinement compared to buried single-plasmon waveguides1,3. To\nconfine the electrical current, high resistivity regions are realised on both sides of the top\ncontact metal strip via proton implantation7. The presence of these regions is crucial for\ndevice operation; in fact, their elimination resulted into systematic device failure due to\nlateral current spreading, even after removing the highly doped top contact layer.\n\nIn Fig. 1(b) the modal overlap is plotted as a function of metal strip width, to show its\neffect on the lateral confinement (the overlap factor is calculated assuming an electron\n\n4\n\n\fchannel and metal strip of equal widths). The overlap starts to decrease for strip widths lower\nthan ~ 40 \u03bcm: this must be compared with the 120 \u03bcm found for single plasmon buried\nwaveguides7. The calculated waveguide losses (\u03b1w) are approximately constant (\u03b1w ~ 24cm1\n\n) for strip widths between 20 and 100 \u03bcm.\n\nBuried strip-waveguide devices were fabricated based on the scheme of Fig. 1(a). First,\nthe active region of Ref. [4] was grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on top of a 300 nm\nAl0.5Ga0.5As etch stop layer. By using the techniques detailed in references 3 and 8, the active\nregion was then bonded on top of an n+ GaAs host substrate, and the original semi-insulating\nsubstrate removed by wet etching. Subsequently, a 37\u03bcm wide Ti/Au (20nm/150nm) metal\nstrip was evaporated onto the exposed active region and an electrical channel 30\u03bcm in width\nwas defined by proton implantation (see the Inset of Fig 1(b)). This was obtained using\nproton energies of 300keV and 800keV to realise, on either sides of the strip, two insulating\nlayers at depths of approximately 3\u03bcm and 8\u03bcm from the wafer surface. Contrary to the\nburied single surface plasmon waveguide, with this scheme it is no longer necessary to define\na ridge for electrical contact purposes as back contacting is made through the n+ host\nsubstrate7. We also note that the top contacts were left un-annealed. This was to avoid\nweakening of the In-Au wafer bond between the active region and host substrate, which\nstarts to deteriorate at temperatures above 200\u00b0C3,10.\n\nDevices were cleaved into laser bars, indium soldered to copper mounts, gold wire\nbonded and characterized in a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat. The emitted light was\ncollected using f/0.9 optics and refocused on a broad area room-temperature thermoelectric\ndetector. The detector was calibrated using an absolute THz power meter from Thomas\n\n5\n\n\fKeating Instruments. For pulsed operation, a train of 1\u03bcs pulses with a period of 100\u03bcs was\nused, modulated with a 5Hz square envelope to match the response of the detector.\n\nIn Fig. 2 the continuous wave (CW) electrical and optical characteristics of a 500\u03bc m\nlong, buried strip-waveguide THz QCL are shown at different heat sink temperatures. The\ndevice operates up to 65K, with a threshold current of 19 mA at 4K, the lowest, to our\nknowledge, of any ridge-cavity QCL regardless of the emission wavelength. The\ncorresponding threshold current density is 127A/cm2. The initial voltage step in the V-I\ncurve, as well as the overall higher operating voltage compared to standard ridge devices, is\ndue to the Schottky nature of the non-annealed Ti/Au top contact3,4.\n\nThe inset of Fig. 3 shows a typical CW spectrum, recorded at 4K with a Fourier\ntransform interferometer operated in rapid-scan mode at a maximum spectral resolution of\n0.25cm-1. The emission wavelength is centred at ~ 106 \u03bcm (2.8 THz), close to that of the\ndesign, and the laser remains mono-mode over the entire current operating range, with a side\nmode suppression ratio of 30 dB. Indeed, for this 500 \u03bcm long device we compute a roundtrip frequency of ~ 80 GHz, corresponding to a longitudinal mode spacing of ~ 0.3 meV.\nThis represents as much as ~ 1/4 of the spontaneous emission linewidth as measured from\nelectroluminescence spectra of this active region, preventing multimode emission. We note\nthat the double-metal waveguide geometry allows for short cavity devices to be realised\nwithout sacrificing laser performance in terms of threshold current density, due to the\ninherently high reflectivity of the cavity mirrors (based on the model of Herzinger et al,, we\ncompute reflectivities in excess of 90% depending on device size)\n\n11\n\n. The drawback,\n\nhowever, is the relatively low output power, of ~ 100 \u03bcW at 4K, compared to devices based\non single plasmon waveguides, yielding power levels in the tens of mW range4,7.\n\n6\n\n\fThe threshold current density as a function of temperature, for the same 500 \u03bcm long\ndevice of Fig. 2 is plotted in Fig. 3 for pulsed and CW operation: maximum temperatures are\nof 70K and 65K respectively. By comparing the change in temperature between the pulsed\nand CW characteristics with the power dissipated at threshold we derive a total thermal\nresistance of 28K/W for the present device12. For a 1.5 mm long laser we obtain a total\nthermal resistance of 10.8 K/W, more than a factor of two lower compared to the 23.3 K/W\nobtained from a standard ridge-cavity double-metal sample of the same surface area (50 \u03bcm\nx 1.1 mm, not shown). The decrease in thermal resistance for the buried strip-waveguide is a\nresult of the extra material on either side of the electrically pumped active region, which,\nmoreover, benefits from the asymmetry in thermal resistance of QCLs7,9. This last fact is\ndemonstrated by observing that for the 120\u03bcm wide single-plasmon devices of Ref. [7], we\nfound a decrease in thermal resistance of only 30% from the ridge-cavity to buried\nwaveguide geometry. As discussed at the beginning of this work this is due to different\naspect ratios between the lateral surface, determined by the thickness of the active region,\nand the area of the device.\n\nCompared to double-metal ridge-cavity samples, buried strip-waveguide devices\npresent a smaller current dynamical range (defined as the current density span between\nthreshold and power saturation). This is a consequence of a reduction in the maximum\ncurrent density, from ~ 260 A/cm2 at 4K, for a double-metal ridge-cavity laser, to the 195\nA/cm2 of device presented in Fig. 2. The reduction of the current range, related to device\nfabrication issues, is still under investigation and limits the operating temperatures of the\nburied devices. Double-metal ridge lasers, 1.5 mm long and 50 \u03bcm wide, operated up to 90\nand 70K in pulsed and CW mode respectively (not shown). These devices also exhibited a\n\n7\n\n\fslightly lower threshold current density (117 A/cm2 at 4K), compared to the 127 A/cm2 of\nFig. 2 in agreement with the different mode overlaps, of 95% and 88% for the 50 \u03bcm wide\netched ridge and the present buried cavity respectively.\n\nIn summary we have shown that by combining double-metal waveguiding with proton\nimplantation it is possible to realise buried waveguides of extremely small width, comparable\nto the wavelength in the material, without decreasing the modal overlap, nor increasing the\noptical losses. These buried strip-waveguide QCLs yielded record low CW threshold currents\nof 19mA at T = 4.2K (with a power dissipated at threshold of ~ 100 mW) and more than a\nfactor of two reduction in the thermal resistance, compared to similar sized ridge-cavity\ndouble-metal devices.\n\nThis work was partially funded by the European Community through the Framework\nVI Integrated Project \"TERANOVA\".

The electron channel is 37 \u03bcm wide and is defined\nby proton implantation. The calculated modal overlap and waveguide losses are 95% and\n24cm-1 respectively. b) Effect of metal strip width on the overlap of the optical mode with the\nactive region. The overlap is calculated assuming an electrical channel equal in width to the\nmetal strip. Inset. SEM picture of the laser facet after partial wet-etching. The etch speed is\nlarger in the proton implanted regions, resulting into a 30 \u03bcm wide step visible on the top\nsurface, in correspondence with the non-implanted electrical channel. The etch solution is\nresponsible for the undercut underneath the 37 \u03bcm wide metal strip. The difference in the\nwidths of the metal strip and the electrical channel was unintentional and resulted into an\noverlap factor of 88%, compared to the nominal 95%.\n\nFigure 2: CW electrical and optical characteristics of a 500 \u03bcm long, 37 \u03bcm wide buried\nstrip-waveguide from 4K to 65K.\n\nFigure 3: Threshold current density as a function of heat-sink temperature in continuous\nwave and pulsed operation for the same buried strip-waveguide laser of Fig. 2.
