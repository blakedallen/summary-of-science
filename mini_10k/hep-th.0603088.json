Subsequently, it was shown [4, 5] that a subclass of these theories have exactly the\nmatter content of the MSSM. Since the observable sector matter spectra are realistic, these\nground states are called \"heterotic standard models\". The vacuum with exactly the MSSM\nmatter spectrum is called the \"minimal\" heterotic standard model. In the last year similar\nobservable sectors were found using orbifolds [6] or geometrically with a supersymmetric\nhidden sector [7, 8]. Other approaches can be found in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\nThe vacua [1, 2, 3, 4] are constructed by compactifying the E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string on a\ntorus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefold whose fundamental group is Z3 \u00d7 Z3 [15]. The observable\nsector contains a holomorphic vector bundle V with structure group SU(4). This bundle\nwas proven to be slope-stable for the two Higgs pair vacua in [16] and for the minimal\nheterotic standard model in [17]. Hence, in all cases the observable sector admits a gauge\nconnection satisfying the hermitian Yang-Mills equations. The SU(4) structure group breaks\nE8 down to Spin(10). The discovery of non-vanishing neutrino masses requires that realistic\nsupersymmetric theories contain right-handed neutrinos [18, 19]. It is well-known that the\n16 representation of Spin(10) is composed of an entire family of quarks/leptons, including a\nright-handed neutrino. For this reason, an SU(4) vector bundle was chosen for the observable\nsector of heterotic standard models. A formalism for computing the number of vector bundle\nmoduli was presented in [20] and applied to the observable sector bundles. For example, the\nnumber of vector bundle moduli in the observable sector of the minimal heterotic standard\nmodel is thirteen. The Spin(10) gauge group is then broken by Z3 \u00d7 Z3 Wilson lines. Since\nZ3 \u00d7 Z3 is Abelian, the low energy theory consists of the standard model gauge group,\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y , times an additional gauge group, U(1)B\u2212L , whose charges are\nthe B \u2212 L quantum numbers.\nIn addition to having realistic spectra, the observable sector of heterotic standard models\nalso satisfies important phenomenological constraints. Consider nucleon decay in this context. The additional U(1)B\u2212L symmetry, if spontaneously broken at a low mass scale, suppresses \u2206L = 1 and \u2206B = 1 dimension four operators in the effective theory. These vacua\nexhibit natural doublet-triplet splitting [1, 21, 22]. This eliminates color triplet induced\ndimension five operators which can lead to rapid nucleon decay. The unification scale of het1\n\n\ferotic standard models is of O(1016 GeV ). Hence, nucleon decay via heavy Spin(10) vector\nbosons is sufficiently suppressed. Taken together, we see that heterotic standard models naturally reduce the nucleon decay rate to a level consistent with experimental bounds [23, 24].\nFormalisms for computing the Higgs \u03bc-terms and Yukawa couplings in the observable sectors\nof heterotic standard models were presented in [25] and [26] respectively. In the minimal\ntheory, for example, it was shown that the cubic moduli-Higgs-Higgs conjugate terms in the\nsuperpotential vanish due to \"geometric\" effects. Therefore, non-vanishing Higgs \u03bc-terms\nonly arise from higher order interactions and, hence, are naturally suppressed [27, 28]. Minimal heterotic standard models were also shown to have an interesting texture of Yukawa\ncouplings which renders the first quark/lepton family naturally light.\nThe hidden sector of heterotic standard models can be constructed in two ways. Both\nmust have a slope-stable holomorphic vector bundle on the hidden orbifold plane. In the\nfirst approach, one allows only five-branes in the bulk space. The hidden sector bundle\nand the cohomology class of the five-brane are then chosen so as to saturate the anomaly\ncancellation condition. For heterotic standard models with five-branes, it was shown in [17]\nthat the Chern class of the hidden sector bundle satisfies a strong necessary condition, the\nBogomolov bound, for slope-stability. However, explicit slope-stable hidden sector bundles\nwere not constructed in [4, 17]. Note that vacua of this type are N = 1 supersymmetric.\nThe only obvious way to break supersymmetry in this context is via gaugino condensation\nin the hidden sector. However, as was shown in a simplified theory in [29] and reviewed and\nextended to a larger context in this paper, gaugino condensation alone is not sufficient to\nbreak supersymmetry in strongly coupled heterotic vacua. Furthermore, the minimum of the\nmoduli potential energy will have a large, negative cosmological constant, consistent with\nthe preservation of supersymmetry. Given the fact that supersymmetry is broken at energies\nbelow the electroweak scale, and the observed very small, positive cosmological constant [30],\nhidden sectors of this type would not appear to be of phenomenological interest.\nThe second approach, which in many ways is mathematically simpler, is to allow both\nfive-branes and anti-five-branes in the bulk space. The hidden sector bundle and the fivebrane/anti-five-brane curves are then chosen to satisfy the anomaly cancellation condition.\nThe simplest way to do this is to take the hidden sector vector bundle to be trivial, which is\ntrivially slope-stable. If one assumes that there are no Wilson lines in the hidden sector then\nthe hidden sector gauge group is E8 . Given a specific Calabi-Yau threefold and observable\nsector bundle, the classes of the five-brane/anti-five-brane curves are explicitly fixed by the\nanomaly condition. The appearance of an anti-five-brane in the bulk space can potentially\n2\n\n\fsolve both problems inherent in the first approach. First of all, it explicitly breaks supersymmetry and, hence, one expects supersymmetry breaking operators in the effective theory.\nSecondly, as with the anti D-branes of the Type IIB theories discussed in [31, 32], anti-fivebranes give a positive contribution to the effective theory. This allows the minimum of the\nmoduli potential energy function to be \"uplifted\" to a small, positive cosmological constant.\nHence, the second approach to the hidden sector in heterotic standard models would appear\nto be more suitable to construct realistic models of particle physics and cosmology.\nIn this paper we will discuss the structure of heterotic standard models where the hidden\nsector has a trivial bundle with no Wilson lines and there are both five-branes and anti-fivebranes in the bulk space. Specifically, we will do the following. In Section 2, we review the\nstructure of heterotic M-theory vacua and present the most general K\u00e4hler potentials and\nsuperpotentials in this context. In Section 3 it is shown that in strongly coupled heterotic\nvacua with only five-branes in the bulk space and gaugino condensation in the hidden sector,\nthe values of all moduli can be fixed. However, the minimum of the potential energy has\na large, negative cosmological constant and does not break supersymmetry. This is proven\nwithin a slightly simplified context. Specifically, we consider the dilaton, all K\u00e4hler and complex structure moduli and the translation modulus of the bulk five-brane. However, to make\nthe analysis tractable only a single vector bundle modulus is assumed. We also introduce\nstring instantons on representative curves only. A further analysis of string instantons is, at\npresent, impossible since the complete instanton series is unknown. Within this context,in\nSection 4, we show that the addition of an anti-five-brane to the bulk space and choosing the\nhidden sector bundle to be trivial continues to admit a vacuum which stabilizes all moduli.\nHowever, by appropriately choosing the K\u00e4hler moduli one can make the minimum of the\npotential energy have a small, positive cosmological constant consistent with the observed\nvalue. This minimum will also break N = 1 supersymmetry. Finally, in Section 5 we apply this formalism to the moduli of the minimal heterotic standard model [4]. All moduli\nare stabilized in this context. Furthermore, the minimum of the potential can have a phenomenologically acceptable positive cosmological constant and break supersymmetry. This\noccurs for K\u00e4hler moduli for which the observable sector vector bundle is slope-stable.\nFinally, we want to point out that some of the results derived in this paper were anticipated, in a simpler context, in [33, 34].\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nE8 \u00d7 E8 Heterotic Vacua with Five-Branes\n\nBasic Structure of the Vacuum\nIn this section, we will consider E8 \u00d7E8 strongly coupled heterotic string theory compactified\non the space\nM = R4 \u00d7 X \u00d7 S 1 /Z2 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere X is a Calabi-Yau threefold and S 1 /Z2 is an interval in the eleventh-dimension. Furthermore, we will choose the Calabi-Yau threefold X to be elliptically- or torus-fibered over\neither an Enriques surface E, a del Pezzo surface dPi , i = 1, . . . , 9, or a Hirzebruch surface Fr ,\nfor integers r \u2265 0. The threefold may have either trivial or non-trivial fundamental group.\nDenote by vCY and \u03c0\u03c1 the reference volume of the Calabi-Yau threefold and the reference\nlength of the interval in the eleventh dimension respectively. The physical volume and\nlength are obtained by multiplying them by the appropriate moduli. To achieve the correct\nphenomenological values for the four-dimensional Newton and gauge coupling parameters,\nMP l \u223c 1019 GeV,\n\n\u03b1GU T \u223c\n\n1\n,\n25\n\n(2.2)\n\nwe choose the inverse reference radius of the Calabi-Yau threefold and the inverse reference\nlength of the eleventh dimension to be\n\u22121/6\n\nvCY\n\n\u223c 1016 GeV,\n\n(\u03c0\u03c1)\u22121 \u223c 1014 GeV\n\n(2.3)\n\nrespectively.\nLet us list the complex moduli fields arising from such a compactification. They are the\ndilaton S, the h1,1 moduli T I and the h2,1 moduli Z\u03b1 . These moduli will be taken to be\ndimensionless. Note that\nRe S = V,\n\nRe T I = RaI V \u22121/3 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere V is the volume modulus of the Calabi-Yau threefold, R is the modulus associated\nwith the length of the S 1 /Z2 interval and the aI satisfy the constraint\n1\nV = dIJK aI aJ aK\n6\n\n(2.5)\n\nwith dIJK the Calabi-Yau intersection numbers. Given the reference lengths chosen in (2.3),\nthe dimensionless moduli Re S and R must be stabilized at the values\nRe S \u223c 1,\n4\n\nR \u223c 1.\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fIn addition to the geometrical compactification manifold (2.1), one must specify a slopestable holomorphic vector bundle on the orbifold plane at each end of the interval. On\nthe observable brane, one chooses a vector bundle V with structure group G \u2286 E8 such\nthat the low energy theory is supersymmetric and realistic. For example, bundles leading\nto the exact MSSM spectrum [4, 7], extensions of the MSSM [1, 2, 3, 35, 36, 37, 38] and\nGUT theories [9, 39] at low energy have been constructed. These vector bundles give rise\nto complex vector bundle moduli \u03c6a . The hidden orbifold plane must also support a slopestable holomorphic vector bundle V \u2032 with structure group G\u2032 \u2286 E8 . In this paper, we will\nalways assume that V \u2032 is the trivial bundle. This bundle is trivially slope-stable and leads\nto a low energy hidden sector gauge group of E8 with no additional moduli.\nFinally, we allow for the possibility that there are five-branes and anti-five-branes in the\nbulk space between the orbifold planes. Let [W] and [W\u0304] be the Poincare dual of the curves\non which these branes and anti-branes respectively are wrapped. Then the cancellation of\nquantum anomalies requires that\nc2 (V ) \u2212 c2 (T X) + [W] \u2212 [W\u0304] = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nNote that c2 (V \u2032 ) = 0 since V \u2032 has been chosen to be trivial. Generically, the curve class\nsatisfying (2.7) is neither effective nor anti-effective, corresponding to both wrapped fivebranes and anti-five-branes. However, in this section, we will assume that T X and V are such\nthat the curve is strictly effective, leading to wrapped five-branes only. Later in the paper\nwe will loosen this assumption and allow for anti-branes as well. We will further assume that\nthe curve is chosen so as to correspond to the wrapping of a single five-brane. In this case,\nthe five-brane contributes another complex modulus Y to the low energy theory [40, 41, 42],\nwhere\nRe Y =\n\nY Re T\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(2.8)\n\nand Y is the position of the five-brane in the eleventh dimension. The superfield T is defined\nas follows. Let \u03c9I , I = 1, . . . , h1,1 be a basis for H 1,1 and z J , J = 1, . . . , h1,1 be the dual\nbasis of H2 where\n\n1\n1/3\nvCY\n\nZ\n\nzJ\n\n\u03c9I = \u03b4JI .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe curve z5 on which the five-brane is wrapped can be expanded as z5 = cI z I . Then T is\ndefined to be\nT = cI T I .\n\n5\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fIt is straightforward to show that\nRe T =\n\n1\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9T ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nz5\n\nwhere\n\u03c9T = Re T I \u03c9I .\n\n(2.12)\n\nK\u00e4hler Potentials\nThe K\u00e4hler potential for the S and T I moduli was computed in [43] and is given by\nKS,T = \u2212MP2 l ln(S + S\u0304) \u2212 MP2 l ln\n\n\u0001\n1\ndIJK (T + T\u0304 )I (T + T\u0304 )J (T + T\u0304 )K .\n6\n\nThe K\u00e4hler potential for the complex structure moduli Z\u03b1 was found in [44] to be\nZ\n2\nKZ = \u2212MP l ln(\u2212i\n\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304),\n\n(2.13)\n\n(2.14)\n\nX\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic (3, 0) form. In [45], the K\u00e4hler potential for the five-brane\nmodulus Y was calculated. It was shown that\nK5 = 2MP2 l \u03c45\n\n(Y + \u0232)2\n,\n(S + S\u0304)(T + T\u0304 )\n\n(2.15)\n\nwith \u03c45 and T5 given by\n1/3\n\nT5 vCY (\u03c0\u03c1)2\n,\nMP2 l\n1\n= (2\u03c0)1/3\n.\n2 2/3\n(2\u03ba11 )\n\n\u03c45 =\n\n(2.16)\n\nT5\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe eleven-dimensional gravitational coupling parameter \u03ba11 is related to the four-dimensional\nPlanck mass as\n\u03ba211 =\n\n\u03c0\u03c1vCY\n.\nMP2 l\n\n(2.18)\n\nSubstituting (2.18) into (2.17), we can write \u03c45 as\n\u03c45 =\n\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u00111/3\n2\n\n1/3\nvCY\n\n\u0012\n\n(\u03c0\u03c1)2\nvCY MP l\n\n\u00132/3\n\n.\n\n(2.19)\n\nFor the reference parameters chosen in (2.2) and (2.3), \u03c45 becomes\n\u03c45 \u223c 1.\n6\n\n(2.20)\n\n\fThe K\u00e4hler potential for the vector bundle moduli is less well-known. It was shown in [33]\nthat it always has the form\nK\u0303bundle = kMP2 l Kbundle (\u03c6a , \u03c6 \u0304a ),\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere k is a dimensionless constant given by\nk=\n(4\u03c0)5/3\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n(\u03c0\u03c1)2 MP2 l\n\n\u00111/3\n\n(2.22)\n\nand Kbundle is a dimensionless function of the vector bundle moduli \u03c6a . For the reference\nparameters given in (2.2) and (2.3), k takes the value\nk \u223c 10\u22125 .\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe generic properties of Kbundle relevant to moduli stabilization were discussed in detail\nin [46].\nWe conclude that\nK = KS,T + KZ + K5 + K\u0303bundle\n\n(2.24)\n\nis the total K\u00e4hler potential for all the moduli.\n\nSuperpotentials\nThere are three non-vanishing contributions to the superpotential for the moduli. First\nconsider the flux-induced superpotential. Let us turn on a non-zero flux of the Neveu-Schwarz\nthree-form H on the Calabi-Yau threefold. The presence of this non-zero flux generates a\nsuperpotential for the h2,1 moduli of the form [47, 48]\nZ\n3\nWf = MP l h1\nH\u0303 \u2227 \u03a9\u0303,\n\n(2.25)\n\nX\n\nwhere\nh1 =\n\n1\n1/2\nvCY MP3 l\n\n(2.26)\n\nand H\u0303 and \u03a9\u0303 are both dimensionless. They have been obtain from H and \u03a9 by scaling with\nrespect to the appropriate reference parameters. For the values chosen in (2.2) and (2.3), h1\nbecomes\nh1 \u223c 10\u22128 .\n7\n\n(2.27)\n\n\fAs discussed in [33], the warping away from a Calabi-Yau threefold due to the flux will be\nnegligibly small if we take\n\nZ\n\nH\u0303 \u226a 105 ,\n\n(2.28)\n\nC\n\nwhere C is an appropriate three-cycle. Henceforth, we will always choose the flux to satisfy\nthis condition.\nSecond, let us turn on a gaugino condensate on the hidden brane [29, 45, 49, 50, 51, 52,\n53, 54, 55]. As discussed in [33], this produces a superpotential for the S, T I and Y moduli\ngiven by\nWg =\n\nMP3 l h2\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nY2\n(2) I\nexp \u2212\u01eb S \u2212 \u03b1I T + \u03c45\n,\nT\n\nwhere\nh2 \u223c\n\n1\n\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00112/3\n11\n\n1/2\nMP l vCY (\u03c0\u03c1)\n\n4\u03c0\n\n(2.29)\n\n(2.30)\n\nFor the values of the reference parameters chosen in (2.2) and (2.3),\nh2 \u223c 10\u22126 .\n\n(2.31)\n\nThe coefficient \u01eb is related to the coefficient b0 of the beta-function and is given by\n\u01eb=\n\n6\u03c0\n.\nb0 \u03b1GU T\n\n(2.32)\n\nFor the E8 gauge group of our hidden sector b0 = 90. Taking \u03b1GU T to have its phenomenological value given in (2.2), we obtain\n\u01eb \u223c 5.\n\n(2.33)\n\n(2)\n\nThe term \u03b1I T I is related to the tension of the hidden brane [43]. Choosing the hidden\nsector vector bundle to be trivial, we find that\nZ\n\u03c0\u03c1 \u0010 \u03ba11 \u00112/3\n(2)\n\u03b1I = \u2212\n\u03c9I ,\n32\u03c0vCY 4\u03c0\nzR\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere zR is the curve Poincare dual to Tr R \u2227 R. One can estimate the order of magnitude\n(2)\n\nof \u03b1I by using the reference parameters (2.2) and (2.3) in (2.34). The result is that\nZ\n1\n(2)\n\u03b1I \u223c 1/3\n\u03c9I .\n(2.35)\nvCY zR\nThe term \u03c45 was presented in (2.16). Recall, using (2.2) and (2.3), that\n\u03c45 \u223c 1.\n8\n\n(2.36)\n\n\fThe real part of\n\nY2\n(2.37)\nT\nrepresents the inverse square of the gauge coupling parameter on the hidden brane, with the\n(2)\n\nS \u2212 \u03b1I T I + \u03c45\n\nlast two terms being threshold corrections [29, 45].\nThe third contribution to the moduli superpotential arises from worldsheet instantons,\nthat is, strings wrapped on holomorphic curves in the Calabi-Yau threefold. In our context,\nthese are generated by membranes stretching between branes. At long wavelength, such\nconfigurations reduce to strings wrapping holomorphic curves. There are three different\ntypes of membrane configurations that contribute to the superpotential.\n1. A membrane stretching between the two orbifold planes.\n2. A membrane beginning on the observable sector plane and ending on the five-brane.\n3. A membrane beginning on the five-brane and ending on the hidden sector plane.\nLet us begin with the first configuration, a membrane stretching between the two orbifold\nplanes and wrapped on an isolated holomorphic curve C. It was shown in [56] that its\nnon-perturbative contribution to the superpotential has the structure\n\u0001\n\u0001\nWnp [C] \u223c Pfaff D\u2212 |C exp \u2212 \u03c4 \u03c9\u0303I T I ,\nwhere\n\u03c4=\nand\n\u03c9\u0303I =\n\n(2.38)\n\nTM \u03c0\u03c1 1/3\nvCY\n2\n\n(2.39)\n\nZ\n\n(2.40)\n\n1\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n\u03c9I .\nC\n\nNote that\n\n1\n.\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nFor the reference parameters in (2.2) and (2.3), \u03c4 becomes\nTM \u03c0\u03c1 =\n\n\u03c4 \u223c 102 .\n\n(2.41)\n\n(2.42)\n\nHenceforth, \u03c4 will be assumed to be much greater than unity, which is naturally the case.\nThe factor\nPfaff D\u2212 |C\n\n9\n\n\u0001\n\n(2.43)\n\n\fin (2.38) is the Pfaffian of the chiral Dirac operator twisted by the observable sector bundle\npulled back to the curve C, see [56]. This factor has been explicitly calculated in a number of\ncontexts [57, 58, 59] and found to be a homogeneous polynomial of the \"transition\" moduli\nof the curve C. Note that there can be many isolated curves C in the Calabi-Yau threefold. It\nhas been demonstrated that, in some contexts, the sum of the superpotential contributions\nfrom these curves vanishes identically [60]. However, in the context of this paper this is not\ngenerically the case, as shown explicitly in [58].\nNow consider the second configuration, that is, a membrane stretching between the observable sector plane and the five-brane. In this case the membrane wraps on the same curve\nas the five-brane, namely z5 . The contribution to the superpotential is very similar to (2.38).\nOne finds that\n(1)\n\nW5\n\n\u0001\n\u223c Pfaff D\u2212 |z5 e\u2212\u03c4 Y\n\n(2.44)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is given in (2.39) and Pfaff(D)\u2212 |z5 is (2.43) with C = z5 . Similarly, the third\nconfiguration, that is, a membrane stretching from the five-brane to the hidden sector plane,\ncontributes\n(2)\n\nW5\n\n\u223c e\u2212\u03c4 (T \u2212Y)\n\n(2.45)\n\nto the superpotential. Note that since we choose a trivial vector bundle on the hidden sector\norbifold, the Pfaffian is just unity.\n\n3\n\nModuli Stabilization\n\nIn a typical heterotic vacuum, the number of moduli is rather large. For example, in the\nminimal heterotic standard model [4], there is the dilaton S, 3 = h1,1 moduli T I , 3 = h2,1\nmoduli Z\u03b1 , 13 vector bundle moduli \u03c6a and the five-brane translation modulus Y. Other\nheterotic vacua often have far more moduli, especially vector bundle moduli whose number\ncan be of O(102 ). Therefore, to obtain an explicit analytic solution for the moduli potential\nand its minima we must simplify the model while retaining its essential properties.\n\nh1,1 = 1 Case\nIt was argued in [33] that one can consider only one h1,1 modulus and one vector bundle\nmodulus, T and \u03c6 respectively, without any loss of generality. One need not restrict the\nnumber of h2,1 moduli Z\u03b1 . Therefore, we will, in this subsection, assume that the spectrum\nof our vacuum consists of the moduli S, T , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6 and Y.\n10\n\n\fThe K\u00e4hler potential of our simplified model is given by\nK = KS,T + KZ + K5 + K\u0303bundle ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nKS,T = \u2212MP2 l ln(S + S\u0304) \u2212 3MP2 l ln(T + T\u0304 ),\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere (2.13) becomes\n\nexpression (2.14) remains\nKZ =\n\n\u2212MP2 l\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304\n\n(3.3)\n\n(Y + \u0232)2\n.\n(S + S\u0304)(T + T\u0304 )\n\n(3.4)\n\nln \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nand (2.15) simplifies to\nK5 = 2MP2 l \u03c45\n\nIn (3.2), we have chosen the Calabi-Yau intersection number to be\nd111 = 1\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor simplicity. Any other choice of d111 will give identical equations and leave the conclusions\nunchanged. Note from (2.4) and (2.5) that\nRe T = R.\n\n(3.6)\n\n0 \u2264 Re Y \u2264 Re T,\n\n(3.7)\n\nAlso, by definition\n\nsince the five-brane must be between the orbifold planes. In the following we will always\nassume that\n| Im T | \u226a 1,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich is required to ignore cross coupling between T and \u03c6. For K\u0303bundle we choose\nK\u0303bundle = kMP2 l Kbundle ,\n\nk \u223c 10\u22125,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere, when \u03c6 is less than unity,\nKbundle = \u2212p ln \u03c6 + \u03c6\u0304\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.10)\n\nand p is a dimensionless, positive constant. Expression (3.10) is the simplest function satisfying all the requirements specified in [33]. However, one can choose Kbundle to be any other\nfunction satisfying these requirements without altering the conclusions of this paper.\n11\n\n\fNow consider the superpotential in our simplified vacuum. It is given by\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3.11)\n\nh1 \u223c 10\u22128\n\n(3.12)\n\nW = Wf + Wg + Wnp + W5 + W5 ,\nwhere (2.25) remains\nWf =\n\nMP3 l h1\n\nZ\n\nH\u0303 \u2227 \u03a9\u0303 ,\nX\n\nand (2.29) reduces to\nWg =\n\nMP3 l h2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\nY2\nexp \u2212\u01eb S \u2212 \u03b1 T + \u03c45\nT\n(2)\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n(3.13)\n\nwith\nh2 \u223c 10\u22126 ,\n\n\u01eb \u223c 5,\n\n\u03b1(2) \u223c 1,\n\n\u03c45 \u223c 1.\n\n(3.14)\n\nSince h1,1 = 1, the space H2 (X) is spanned by a single curve class z. Any other effective\nclass is simply a positive integer multiple of z. For simplicity, we will take C = z5 = z in\nthe following. Other choices for C and z5 will not alter the conclusions of this subsection. It\nfollows that the non-perturbative superpotential (2.38) is now given by\nWnp = c1 MP3 l \u03c6d+1 e\u2212\u03c4 T ,\n\n(3.15)\n\n\u03c4 \u223c 102 ,\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere\n\nwe have restored its natural scale and c1 is some dimensionless coefficient of order unity. The\nPfaffian, which must be a homogeneous polynomial, is represented by the factor \u03c6d+1 . We\nwill assume that d + 1 is sufficiently large. This is the case in explicit examples [58]. Finally,\nexpressions (2.44) and (2.45) for the five-brane superpotentials become\n(1)\n\n= c2 MP3 l \u03c6d+1 e\u2212\u03c4 Y\n\n(3.17)\n\n(2)\n\n= c3 MP3 l e\u2212\u03c4 (T \u2212Y)\n\n(3.18)\n\nW5\nand\n\nW5\n\nrespectively, where c2 and c3 are dimensionless coefficients of order unity.\nHaving specified the complete K\u00e4hler and superpotentials, one can now solve for the\nminimum of the moduli potential energy. Specifically, we will show that the system of\nequations\nDF W = 0,\n12\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fwhere DW is the K\u00e4hler covariant derivative, has a solution in the correct phenomenological\nrange for each field F = S, T, Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y.\nTo begin with, consider the equations\nDZ\u03b1 W = 0.\n\n(3.20)\n\nUnder the assumption that\nWf\n\n(1)\n\n\u226b Wg , Wnp , W5\n\n(2)\n\n(3.21)\n\n, W5\n\nit was argued in [33] that (3.20) should have non-trivial solutions that fix each modulus Z\u03b1 .\nThe argument employed here is identical to that given in [31] to obtain moduli stabilization\nin the Type IIB context.\nThe remaining equations, namely\nDS W = 0,\n\nDT W = 0,\n\nDY W = 0,\n\nD\u03c6 W = 0\n\n(3.22)\n\nwere solved in detail in [33]. Here we simply state the results. Writing\nS = S1 + iS2 ,\n\nT = T1 + iT2\n\nY = Y1 + iY2 ,\n\n\u03c6 = rei\u03b8\n\n(3.23)\n\nas well as\nWf = |Wf | eif ,\n\n(3.24)\n\nthe solution to equations (3.22) were found to be the following. First,\nS1 \u223c 1,\n\nS2 \u223c \u2212\n\nf + 2\u03c0n1\n,\n\u01eb\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere n1 is an arbitrary integer. Note that Re S \u223c 1, as required by (2.6). Second, one finds\nf + \u03c0(2n3 + 1)\n,\n(3.26)\n\u03c4\nwith n3 an arbitrary integer. Again, Re T = R \u223c 1, as required by (2.6). Since naturally\nT1 \u223c 1,\n\nT2 \u223c \u2212\n\n\u03c4 \u226b 1, one can choose n3 so that | Im T | \u226a 1 which is consistent with assumption (3.8).\nThird,\n\nS1\n, Y2 \u223c 0 .\n(3.27)\n2\u03c45\nRecalling that \u03c45 \u223c 1, we see that Re Y \u2264 Re T , consistent with (3.7). Finally, one finds\nY1 =\n\nthat\nr=\n\n\u0012\n\npk|Wf |e\u03c4 Y1\n2(d + 1)c2 cos(\u03b8)\n\n\u00131/d\n\n13\n\n,\n\n\u03b8=\n\nf + 2\u03c0n2\n.\nd\n\n(3.28)\n\n\fNote that the five contributions to the superpotential, when evaluated at these field values,\nsatisfy the assumption (3.21), as they must.\nIt is straightforward to find the value of the potential energy at this minimum. It is given\nby\n2\n\nVmin = \u22123eK/MP l\n\n|W |2\n|Wf |2\n\u223c\n\u2212\n.\nMP2 l\nMP2 l\n\n(3.29)\n\nThe size of the potential energy is, therefore, determined by the flux-induced superpotential.\nSince from (2.25) and (2.27) Wf is of O(10\u22128MP3 l ), we expect Vmin to be\nVmin \u223c \u221210\u221216 MP4 l \u223c \u22121060 (GeV )4 .\n\n(3.30)\n\nNote that larger values of flux can be allowed, as long as they satisfy the constraint (2.28).\nIn this case the potential will take an even larger negative value at the minimum. Finally,\nsince DF W = 0 in this vacuum, N = 1 supersymmetry remains unbroken.\n\nh1,1 > 1 Case\nAs argued in [33], there is no reason why the above analysis cannot be extended to heterotic\nvacua with larger numbers of K\u00e4hler and vector bundle moduli. In this section, we will\ngeneralize the above discussion to include an arbitrary number of K\u00e4hler moduli T I , I =\n1, . . . , h1,1 , one vector bundle modulus \u03c6, any number of complex structure moduli Z\u03b1 and\nthe five-brane translation modulus Y. Vacua with more than one vector bundle modulus\nwill be considered elsewhere [61]. For specificity, we will analyze our theory in the case of\nh1,1 = 2 K\u00e4hler moduli, T 1 and T 2 . It will be clear from the discussion that this captures\nall relevant information and is easily generalized to arbitrary h1,1 .\nThe K\u00e4hler potential of our vacuum is now\nK = KS,T + KZ + K5 + K\u0303bundle ,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere KZ and K\u0303bundle are given by (2.14) and (3.10),(3.11) respectively. To find KS,T\nfrom (2.13) we must specify the intersection numbers dIJK . Since h1,1 = 2, the spaces\nH 1,1 (X) and H2 (X) are spanned by {\u03c91 , \u03c92 } and its dual basis {z 1 , z 2 } respectively. X\nbeing torus-fibered allows us to identify z 1 with the fiber class and z 2 with the curves in the\nbase. Now, note that taking the volume of z 1 to zero must make V , the volume of X, vanish.\nIt then follows from (2.5) that\nd222 = 0.\n14\n\n(3.32)\n\n\fSimilarly, letting the volume of z 2 vanish should not send V to zero. Hence, d111 6= 0. Finally,\nany term involving d122 would be sub-dominant in our analysis. Hence, we can choose the\nCalabi-Yau intersection numbers to vanish with the exception of\nd111 = 1,\n\nd112 = 1\n\n(3.33)\n\nwithout loss of generality. Intersection numbers of this type will appear in the minimal\nheterotic standard model discussed below. It follows that KS,T is given by (2.13) with\nintersection number (3.33). To specify K5 , one must specify the curve z5 on which the fivebrane is wrapped. It is well-known [] that wrapping a string over a fiber of a torus-fibration\ndoes not contribute to the superpotential. For this reason, in this subsection we will choose\nz5 = z 1 + z 2 .\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhich has a component in the base. It follows from (2.10) that\nT = T 1 + T 2.\n\n(3.35)\n\nK5 is then given by (2.15) with T defined in (3.35). It is helpful to re-express KS,T in terms\nof fields T and T 2 . The second term in (2.13) then becomes\n\u0011\n\u0010\nKS,T = * * * \u2212 MP2 l ln (T + T \u0304 )3 \u2212 2(T + T\u0304 )2 (T 2 + T\u0304 2 ) + (T + T\u0304 )(T 2 + T\u0304 2 )2 .\n\n(3.36)\n\nSimilarly, the superpotential is now\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nW = Wf + Wg + Wnp + W5 + W5 ,\n\n(3.37)\n(2)\n\nwith Wf and Wg given in (2.25) and (2.29) respectively. It is helpful to re-express the \u03b1I T I\nterm in (2.29) in terms of T and T 2 . It follows that\n(2)\n\n\u03b1I T I = \u03b11 T + cT 2 ,\n\n(3.38)\n\n(2)\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere coefficient\n(2)\n\nc = \u01eb(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ).\nHence, one can write Wg as\n2\n\nWg = Wg |T ecT .\n\n(3.40)\n\nTo present Wnp in (2.38), one must give the curves C contributing to this superpotential. In\ngeneral, enumerating and specifying these curves is a very difficult problem which has not\nbeen fully solved. In this subsection, we will simplify the problem and take\nC = z5 = z 1 + z 2 ,\n15\n\nz2 .\n\n(3.41)\n\n\fThis choice reflects the fact that h1,1 = 2 and that both z5 and z 2 have a component in the\nbase. Then (2.38) becomes\nWnp = Wnp |z5 + Wnp |z 2 .\n(1)\n\nW5\n\n(2)\n\nand W5\n\n(3.42)\n\nare given by (2.44) and (2.45) respectively. As in the h1,1 = 1 case, we\n\ncontinue to have\nk \u223c 10\u22125 ,\n\nh1 \u223c 10\u22128 ,\n\nh2 \u223c 10\u22126 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u01eb \u223c 5,\n\n\u03b11 \u223c 1,\n\n\u03c45 \u223c 1,\n\n\u03c4 \u223c 102 .\n\n(3.43)\n\nHaving specified the K\u00e4hler and superpotentials, we now solve for the minimum of the\nmoduli potential energy. Specifically, we will show that the system of equations\nDF W = 0,\n\n(3.44)\n\nwhere DW is the K\u00e4hler covariant derivative, has a solution in the correct phenomenological\nrange for F = S, T , T 2 , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y. We will denote\nT 2 = t1 + it2 .\n\nT = T1 + iT2 ,\n\n(3.45)\n\nFirst consider the equations (3.44) for F = S, T , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y. If we assume that\nt1 . T1 ,\n\n|c|t1 . 1 ,\n\nWnp |z 2 \u226a Wf ,\n\n(3.46)\n\nthen these equations are, to a good approximation, the same as in the h1,1 = 1 case. Hence,\nthe solutions for S, T , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y remain essential those given in (3.25), (3.26), (3.20), (3.28)\nand (3.27) respectively. They become identical to them for t1 \u226a T1 and |c|t1 \u226a 1. Clearly, it\ngreatly simplifies our analysis if we can continue to use the h1,1 = 1 results. For this reason,\nwe will seek solutions under the assumption that (3.46) holds.\nNow consider the F = T 2 equation\n\u2202T 2 W = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\n2 K W.\n\u2202\nT\nMP2 l\n\n(3.47)\n\nUsing (3.28), we find that the Wnp |z 2 term on the left-hand side of (3.47) can be neglected\nrelative to Wg . Then, assuming conditions (3.46) are valid, (3.47) becomes\n2\n\nWg |T ecT c =\n\n1\nWf .\nT1\n\n(3.48)\n\nIn the analysis of the DS W = 0 equation, one finds that\n1\nWf .\n2\u01ebS1\n16\n\nWg |T = \u2212\n\n(3.49)\n\n\fSubstituting this into (3.48) gives\n2\n\necT = \u22122\n\n\u01ebS1\n.\ncT1\n\n(3.50)\n\nWriting T 2 = t1 + it2 , it follows that\n1\nt1 = ln\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u01ebS1\n|c|T1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.51)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c0(2n4 + 1)\n2n4 \u03c0\n, t2 =\nc\nc\nfor c > 0 and c < 0 respectively and n4 is any integer. Let us parameterize\n\u0012\n\u00131\u2212\u03b4\n2\u01ebS1\nc=\u00b1\n,\nT1\nt2 =\n\nfor c > 0 and c < 0 respectively. Then, the solution for t1 becomes\n\u0013\u03b4\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u01ebS1\n2\u01ebS1\n,\nln\nt1 = |\u03b4|\nT1\nT1\n\n(3.52)\n\n(3.53)\n\n(3.54)\n\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 for c > 0 and \u03b4 < 0 when c < 0. For |\u03b4| . 1, t1 , |c|t1 and |Wnp |z 2 | satisfy the\nassumptions in (3.46).\nAs an example, recall from (3.25), (3.26) and (3.43) that S1 \u223c 1, T1 \u223c 1 and \u01eb \u223c 5. These\nresults were arrived at by implicitly choosing |Wf | to be or order 10\u22128 . Then\nc = \u00b1101\u2212\u03b4\n\n(3.55)\n\nfor c > 0 and c < 0 respectively and t1 becomes\n\u0001\nt1 = |\u03b4| 10\u03b4\u22121 ln(10) ,\n\n(3.56)\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 for c > 0 and \u03b4 < 0 when c < 0. Note that \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 \u223c .2 when |\u03b4| = 1 and\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nincreases to \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 = 2 for |\u03b4| \u226a 1. These are realistic values for the type of Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds we are considering. The general situation is the following. One chooses a torus(2)\n\n(2)\n\nfibered Calabi-Yau threefold with h1,1 = 2 and computes \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 . This is expected to be\na number of O(1). Then adjust the flux superpotential so that\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b11 |\n1\u2212 2\n\u223c O(\u03b4).\n2S1 /T1\n\n(3.57)\n\nIn this way one fine-tunes the left-hand expression to give \u03b4 and, hence, t1 of the desired\nvalue. We will explore this in more generality elsewhere.\n17\n\n\fWe conclude that in the h1,1 = 2 case, there exists a solution of the equations DF W = 0\nfor F = S, T , T 2 , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y. The values for S, T , Z\u03b1 , \u03c6, Y are those given in the h1,1 = 1\ncase and T 2 = t1 + it2 , where\n\u0012\n\n2\u01ebS1\nt1 = |\u03b4|\nT1\n\n\u0013\u03b4\u22121\n\nln\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u01ebS1\nT1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.58)\n\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 for c > 0 and \u03b4 < 0 when c < 0 and\nt2 =\n\n\u03c0(2n4 + 1)\n,\nc\n\nt2 =\n\n2n4 \u03c0\nc\n\n(3.59)\n\nfor c > 0 and c < 0 respectively and n4 is any integer. Note that since t1 . T1 , it follows\nfrom (2.4), (2.5) and (3.33) that Re T \u223c R. Hence, we see from (3.25) and (3.26) that V\nand R continue to be stabilized at the phenomenologically acceptable values of\nV \u223c 1,\n\nR \u223c 1.\n\n(3.60)\n\nSince |Wf | continues to dominate the contributions to the superpotential, we have\nVmin \u223c \u221210\u221216 MP4 l \u223c \u22121060 (GeV )4 ,\n\n(3.61)\n\nas in the h1,1 case. Since DF W = 0 for all fields F , N = 1 supersymmetry remains unbroken\nin this vacuum.\nWe considered the case h1,1 = 2 case for specificity only. The analysis is easily repeated\nfor any number of K\u00e4hler moduli T I , I = 1, . . . , h1,1 when h1,1 > 2. The solutions are similar\nand easily found and the same conclusions will hold.\n\nResults\nThe above results are based on our analysis of simplified, but representative, heterotic Mtheory vacua with a non-trivial, slope-stable holomorphic vector bundle in the observable\nsector, a trivial vector bundle without Wilson lines in the hidden sector and a holomorphic\nfive-brane in the bulk space. We found the following.\n\u2022 For a natural range of parameters, the potential energy function of the moduli fields\nhas a minimum which fixes the values of all moduli. Both Re S and R at this minimum\nare of O(1), as required on phenomenological grounds. The vacuum value of Re Y is\nbetween 0 and R, as it must be.\n18\n\n\f\u2022 The potential energy function evaluated at this minimum is negative. Its value is\ntypically large, of order Vmin \u223c \u221210\u221216 MP4 l . Hence, this theory has a large, negative\ncosmological constant.\n\u2022 The K\u00e4hler covariant derivatives DW vanish for all moduli fields at this minimum.\nHence, supersymmetry is unbroken in this vacuum, despite the occurrence of gaugino\ncondensation in the hidden sector.\nDespite the fact that these results were derived in a simplified model, we see no reason that\nthey do not apply to heterotic vacua with larger numbers of vector bundle moduli, as argued\nin [33]. We note that our conclusions are consistent with the results of [34], in the heterotic\nM-theory context, and [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], in the context of Type\nIIB superstrings. In the case of Type IIB strings, it was shown in [31] that one could \"lift\"\nthe minimum of the moduli potential to a positive value by adding anti D-branes to the\ntheory. The new minimum continues to fix all moduli, has a phenomenologically acceptable\nsmall positive cosmological constant, albeit by fine-tuning [73], and, due to the presence\nof anti D-branes, breaks supersymmetry. As was discussed in [17], a topologically stable\nconfiguration of five-branes and anti-five-branes occurs naturally in the heterotic standard\nmodels presented in [1, 2, 3, 4]. It is reasonable, therefore, to ask whether the existence\nof anti-five-branes in a heterotic M-theory vacuum might, when combined with the results\nof this section, lead to a vacuum with a small, positive cosmological constant that breaks\nsupersymmetry and fixes all moduli. The answer is affirmative. This is the content of the\nfollowing section.\nAs a final comment, note that above we have solved the DF W = 0 equations under the\nassumption that the fields satisfy (3.46). This allowed us to use the solutions for S, T ,\nZ\u03b1 , \u03c6 and Y obtained in the h1,1 = 1 case and, hence, to simplify the analysis. However,\nthis assumption is not necessary. If at least one of the conditions in (3.46) is not imposed,\nthen one would have to search for new solutions for all of the DF W = 0 equations. Since\nthese can be continuously relaxed to the equations discussed above, we see no reason why\nsolutions would not exist. That is, we expect there to be supersymmetric vacua with a\nnegative cosmological constant over a wide range of moduli space. However, we have not\nverified this explicitly.\n\n19\n\n\f4\n\nAdding Anti-Five-Branes\n\nIn [31], it was argued that the vacuum state of flux-compactifications with D-branes and\ngaugino condensation in certain Type IIB theories completely fixes all moduli fields, albeit\nwith a large, negative cosmological constant and without breaking supersymmetry. It was\nthen shown that introducing an anti D-brane into such a vacuum adds a term proportional\nto the tension of the anti D-brane to the original N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian. This\nadditional term was shown to lift the minimum to a meta-stable vacuum that fixes all\nmoduli, breaks the N = 1 supersymmetry and has, after fine-tuning, a phenomenologically\nacceptable small, positive cosmological constant. This mechanism has recently been studied\nin more detail in [74, 75], who reach the same conclusion and explicitly compute the induced\nsupersymmetry breaking terms.\nIn the context of heterotic M-theory, we have seen in the previous section that the vacuum\nstate of flux-compactifications with five-branes and gaugino condensation fixes all moduli,\nbut with a large, negative cosmological constant and without supersymmetry breaking. Following [31], we now add an anti-five-brane in the vacuum state. One can perform, in the\nheterotic context, a calculation similar to that described in [31]. This was carried out in [34]\nwith the result that, again, the original N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian is modified by\nthe addition of a term proportional to the tension of the anti-five-brane. Specifically, this\nterm was found to be\n\n4T5\n\u2206U5\u0304 = 4/3 2\nV R\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 \u2227 J,\n\n(4.1)\n\nX\n\nwhere\nJ = c2 (V ) \u2212 c2 (T X) + [W] + [W\u0304],\n\n(4.2)\n\nthe integral is with respect to the K\u00e4hler form\n\u03c9 = aI \u03c9I\nand\nT5 = (2\u03c0)\n\n1/3\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n2\u03ba211\n\n\u00132/3\n\n,\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u03ba211 =\n\n\u03c0\u03c1vCY\n.\nMP2 l\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn (4.2), [W] is the cohomology class of the wrapped five-brane, [W\u0304] is the class of the\nwrapped anti-five-brane and we have used the fact that the hidden sector bundle V \u2032 has\nbeen chosen to be trivial. The first two terms in (4.2) arise from the \"end-of-the-world\"\norbifold planes. The third and fourth terms are generated by the five-brane and anti-fivebrane respectively. Quantum consistency demands that the theory be anomaly free. It\n20\n\n\ffollows that one must require that\nc2 (V ) \u2212 c2 (T X) + [W] \u2212 [W\u0304] = 0\n\n(4.5)\n\nJ = 2[W\u0304].\n\n(4.6)\n\nand, hence, (4.2) becomes\n\nIt is important to note that if there was no anti-five-brane in the vacuum J and, hence, \u2206U5\u0304\nwould vanish. However, in the presence of an anti-five-brane one has a non-zero addition to\nthe potential energy given by\n\u2206U5\u0304 = 8T5 V5\u0304\nwhere\nV5\u0304 =\n\nZ\n\n1\nV\n\n4/3 R2\n\n,\n\n\u03c9\n\n(4.7)\n\n(4.8)\n\nz5\u0304\n\nis the volume of the curve z5\u0304 on which the anti-five-brane is wrapped.\nGiven (4.7), one can add it to the N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian discussed in the\nprevious section, find the new equations of motion and re-solve for the vacuum solution.\nWe find results completely consistent with those presented in [34] and [31] for the Type\nIIB string. First, the theory continues to possess a local minimum that fixes all moduli.\nIt is related to the supersymmetric vacuum found in the previous section in the sense that\nit continuously relaxes to it as \u2206U5\u0304 is switched off. Second, the values of the moduli at\nthis minimum are not significantly altered over those in the supersymmetric vacuum. In\nparticular, one still finds that\nV \u223c 1,\n\nR \u223c 1.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThird, the addition of \u2206U5\u0304 to the Lagrangian provides a source of positive energy, uplifting\nthe value of the potential at the minimum. Comparing (4.7) and (4.8) with (3.30), and\nusing (4.9), we see that the cosmological constant at the uplifted vacuum can be made\npositive with an arbitrarily small value as long as one chooses\nT5 V5\u0304 \u223c 10\u221216 GeV\n\n(4.10)\n\nor, equivalently, using (2.2), (2.3) and (4.4) that\nV5\u0304\n1/3\nvCY\n\n\u223c 10\u22127 .\n\n(4.11)\n\nFour, N = 1 supersymmetry is broken in the uplifted vacuum. Fifth, as in the Type IIB\ntheories studied in [31], this uplifted vacuum is now meta-stable, with a possibility to tunnel\n21\n\n\fto large values of Re S and Re T . The lifetime of this meta-stable vacuum, however, will be\nvery long. And sixth, recall that ReT \u223c 1 for any h1,1 \u2265 1. It then follows from (2.4), (2.11),\n(4.3), and (4.9) that\nV5\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n\u223c 1.\n\n(4.12)\n\nAll of the above properties are straightforward, if tedious, to prove and are very similar to\nthe calculations required in the Type IIB case. Hence, we won't discuss them further here.\nA detailed analysis of the supersymmetry breaking terms along the lines of [74, 75] will be\npresented elsewhere. What is necessary for us to prove here is that the conditions (4.11)\nand (4.12) can consistently be achieved in our context.\nLet us show that this is possible for the h1,1 = 2 case discussed in the previous section.\nRecall that z5 = z 1 + z 2 is the curve on which the five-brane is wrapped. Then, its volume\nis given by\nV5 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9.\n\n(4.13)\n\nz5 =z 1 +z 2\n\nUsing (2.9) and (4.3) we see that\nV5\n1/3\nvCY\n\n= a1 + a2 .\n\n(4.14)\n\nNow assume that there is an anti five-brane added to the theory which is wrapped on the\ncurve z 2 . Then its volume is\nV5\u0304 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\n\n(4.15)\n\n= a2 .\n\n(4.16)\n\nz2\n\nwhich, using (2.9) and (4.3), becomes\nV5\u0304\n1/3\nvCY\n\nIn this vacuum, t1 and, hence, a2 are much smaller than unity. It then follows from (2.5)\nthat a1 \u223c V 1/3 . Recalling that V \u223c 1, expression (4.14) becomes\nV5\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n\u223c 1.\n\n(4.17)\n\nNow note from (3.58) and (4.9) that a2 \u223c O(\u03b4). By fine-tuning \u03b4 to be small, one can set\nV5\u0304\n1/3\nvCY\n\n\u223c 10\u22127 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nas desired. Thus, in the h1,1 = 2 vacuum discussed above, conditions (4.11) and (4.12) can\nbe simultaneously satisfied.\n22\n\n\fIn a general vacuum, to obtain a small, positive cosmological constant, one must work\nin a region of K\u00e4hler moduli space in which (4.11) and (4.12) are simultaneously satisfied.\nFurthermore, assuming that such a region exists, it must be demonstrated that the observable\nsector vector bundle V is slope-stable with respect to at least one such K\u00e4hler modulus.\nFortunately, all of these conditions can be simultaneously satisfied. To demonstrate this\nrequires that one give an explicit vacuum. In particular, it is necessary to present the fivebrane curve z5 , the anti-five-brane curve z5\u0304 , a holomorphic vector bundle V on the observable\nsector and the explicit region of the K\u00e4hler cone for which V is slope-stable. We will do this\nin the next section for the minimal heterotic standard model.\n\n5\n\nMinimal Heterotic Standard Model\n\nThe minimal heterotic standard model was presented in [4]. The observable sector consists\nof a holomorphic vector bundle V with structure group SU(4) over a torus-fibered CalabiYau threefold X with fundamental group Z3 \u00d7 Z3 . This leads to a low energy theory whose\nmatter content in the observable sector is exactly that of the MSSM. As discussed in [17],\nit is easiest to choose a trivial bundle V \u2032 = OX in the hidden sector. The number and\nproperties of five-branes and anti-five-branes in the bulk space are then determined by the\nrequirement that the theory be anomaly free.\n\nMinimal Heterotic Standard Model\nThe Calabi-Yau threefold X is constructed from a covering space X\u0303 on which Z3 \u00d7 Z3 acts\nfreely. Then\nX = X\u0303\n\n.\n\n\u0001\nZ3 \u00d7 Z3 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nDenote the quotient map as q : X\u0303 \u2192 X. It was shown in [15] that H 1,1 (X\u0303)Z3 \u00d7Z3 is threedimensional and spanned by the cohomology classes \u03c41 , \u03c42 and \u03c6. It follows that H 1,1 (X)\nis also three-dimensional and spanned by \u03c9I , I = 1, 2, 3 where q \u2217 \u03c91 = \u03c41 , q \u2217 \u03c92 = \u03c42 and\nq \u2217 \u03c93 = \u03c6. The intersection numbers of X are defined to be\nZ\n1\ndIJK =\n\u03c9I \u2227 \u03c9J \u2227 \u03c9K .\nvCY X\n\n(5.2)\n\nBy pulling this expression back to X\u0303, one can compute these coefficients. We find that\n1\n1\n, d122 = d212 = d221 = ,\n3\n3\n= d213 = d231 = d312 = d321 = 1 .\n\nd112 = d121 = d211 =\nd123 = d132\n\n23\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fNote that these intersection numbers are mathematically similar to the those presented\nin (3.33). Specifically, they imply that z 1 ,z 2 and z 3 in the minimal heterotic standard model\ncorrespond to z 1 and z 2 in the h1,1 = 2 case, respectively. There are certain codimension\none boundaries in H 1,1 (X) where geometric transitions occur, that is, where the volume of\nat least one curve vanishes. To exclude these regions, one must choose a K\u00e4hler form in the\nthree-dimension K\u00e4hler cone [16]\no\nn\n1\n2 3\n1\n2\n3\nK = a \u03c91 + a \u03c92 + a \u03c93 a , a , a > 0 \u2282 H 1,1 (X).\n\n(5.4)\n\nHenceforth, we will consider only K\u00e4hler classes\n\n\u03c9 = a1 \u03c91 + a2 \u03c92 + a3 \u03c93 \u2208 K.\n\n(5.5)\n\nRecall from (2.5) that V = 61 dIJK aI aJ aK .

The observable sector vector bundle is slope-stable in the\nregion Ks .\n\nit was shown that V is slope-stable with respect to any K\u00e4hler modulus in a restricted threedimensional region Ks of the K\u00e4hler cone K. As will be important in the following, one can\nenlarge the allowed region Ks , see Appendix A. This enlarged region is shown in Figure 1.\n24\n\n\fVolumes of Curves\nIt was shown in [4] that\nc2 (V ) = \u03c912 + 4\u03c922 + 4\u03c91\u03c92 ,\n\nc2 (T X) = 12(\u03c912 + \u03c922 ).\n\n(5.7)\n\nThe cancellation of quantum anomalies requires that\nc2 (V ) \u2212 c2 (T X) + [W] \u2212 [W\u0304] = 0.\nwhere we have used the fact that V \u2032 = OX .

The simplest way to cancel the anomaly is to set\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[W] = 7\u03c912 + 4\u03c922 [W\u0304] = 4 \u03c91 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c912 \u2212 \u03c922 ,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhich we will do henceforth.\nThe volumes of the five-brane curve z5 and the anti-five-brane curve z5\u0304 are easily computed. First consider the anti-five-brane curve. Note that\nZ\nZ\nV5\u0304\n1\n1\n\u03c9 \u2227 [W\u0304].\n= 1/3\n\u03c9=\n1/3\nvCY X\nvCY\nvCY z5\u0304\n\n(5.11)\n\nIt then follows from (5.3), (5.5) and (5.10) that\nV5\u0304\n\n= 4a3 .\n\n1/3\nvCY\n\nSimilarly, for the five-brane curve\nV5\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n1\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n\u03c9=\n\nz5\n\n1\nvCY\n\n(5.12)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 \u2227 [W]\n\n(5.13)\n\nX\n\nwhich, using (5.3), (5.5) and (5.10), becomes\nV5\n\n7\n4\n= a1 + a2 .\n3\n3\n\n1/3\nvCY\n\n(5.14)\n\nNow consider the region Ks in Figure 1. Note that as one approaches the bottom of Ks\nthe modulus a3 \u2192 0. It follows from (5.12) that\n3\n\nV5\n1/3\nvCY\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small. In\n\nparticular, for the appropriate value of a one can set\nV5\u0304\n1/3\nvCY\n\n\u223c 10\u22127 ,\n25\n\n(5.15)\n\n\fas required by (4.11). Now note that the region Ks is bounded on the left by the vertical\nline defined by a1 = a2 . For very small values of a3 , it follows from (5.6) and the fact that\nV \u223c 1 in this vacuum that a1 \u223c\n= a2 \u223c (3)1/3 . Therefore, for moduli inside of Ks near the\nvertical line as a3 \u2192 0, one finds\n\nV5\n1/3\n\nvCY\n\n\u223c 1,\n\n(5.16)\n\nas required by (4.12).\n\nResults\nFor the minimal heterotic standard model we have shown the following.\n\u2022 Taking the hidden sector vector bundle to be trivial, the anomaly cancellation condition\nspecifies that this vacuum has both a five-brane and an anti-five-brane in the S 1 /Z2\ninterval and uniquely fixes their cohomology classes.\n\u2022 Neglecting the anti-five-brane, this vacuum has the structure of the h1,1 > 1 theories\nanalyzed in Section 3. As a consequence, neglecting the anti-five-brane, all moduli\nare stabilized, but at an N = 1 supersymmetry preserving minimum with Vmin \u223c\n\u221210\u221216 MP4 l .\n\u2022 Adding the anti-five-brane lifts the minimum to a meta-stable vacuum with a positive\ncosmological constant. The moduli are fixed in this vacuum and have phenomenologically acceptable values.\n\u2022 There is a region of the K\u00e4hler cone for which the cosmological constant has its experimental value and for which the observable sector vector bundle is slope-stable. One\nexpects that the K\u00e4hler moduli of the meta-stable vacuum can be fine-tuned to lie in\nthis region.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to E. Buchbinder, R. Donagi, B. Nelson, T.

This can be done by finding a set of inequalities that the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli have to satisfy [16], and then showing that a common solution exist. For the minimal\nheterotic standard model, this has been worked out in [17].\nTo find the potentially destabilizing sub-bundles one has to decide if there are maps\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nHom OB1 (\u22124t + 2f ), OB1 (\u2212t + f ) \u2297 I3 = Hom OB1 , OB1 (3t \u2212 f ) \u2297 I3 ,\n(A.1a)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nHom OB2 (\u22124t + 2f ), OB2 (\u2212t + f ) \u2297 I6 = Hom OB2 , OB2 (3t \u2212 f ) \u2297 I6 .\n(A.1b)\ne\nIf there are maps in eq. (A.1a), then the line bundles OXe (\u22124\u03c41 + \u03c42 + 2f ) can map to V,\ne is rendered unstable). On the other hand, if there\nand hence must have negative slope (or V\n\ne In the\nis no map then OXe (\u22124\u03c41 + \u03c42 + 2f ) imposes no restriction on the stability of V.\n\nproof of slope-stability presented in [17], it was always assumed that there are maps of the\nform eqns. (A.1a), (A.1b). This leads to correct, but too strong, inequalities for the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli.\nIn fact, there are no maps in eqns. (A.1a), (A.1b). Recall that there is a single section\n\nof OBi (3t \u2212 f ),\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne OB (3t \u2212 f ) = C ,\nH 0 X,\ni\n\n(A.2)\n\nunique up to scale. Its zero locus are 9 disjoint sections P1 \u2282 Bi , permuted by the Z3 \u00d7 Z3\naction. Furthermore, the points in the ideal sheaves I3 , I6 are the singular points of I1\nKodaira fibers, which do not meet any smooth sections. Therefore,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nHom OB1 , OB1 (3t \u2212 f ) \u2297 I3 = Hom OB2 , OB2 (3t \u2212 f ) \u2297 I6 = 0 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nUsing this result, the Proposition 1 in [17] can be strengthened to\nProposition 1 If all line bundles OXe (a1 \u03c41 + a2 \u03c42 + b\u03c6) with\n\nn\n(a1 , a2 , b) \u2208 (1, \u22121, \u22121), (\u22121, 1, \u22121), (\u22122, 2, 0), (2, \u22122, \u22121),\n(2, \u22125, 1), (1, \u22124, 1), (\u22124, 1, 1)\n\ne is equivariantly stable.\nhave negative slope then the vector bundle V\n\no\n\n(A.4)\n\nThe set Ks of K\u00e4hler moduli such that all slopes are indeed negative is shown in Figure 1.\n27\n\n\fBibliography\n[1] V.
