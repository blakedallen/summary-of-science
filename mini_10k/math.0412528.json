II\nT. BANKS AND T. CONSTANTINESCU\nAbstract. In this paper we continue to investigate a certain class of Hankellike positive definite kernels using their associated orthogonal polynomials.\nThe main result of this paper is about the structure of this kind of kernels.\n\n1. Introduction\nPositive definite kernels are studied for their manifold applications. In this paper we consider a special type of kernels K defined on the free semigroup on N\ngenerators with the property that\nK(\u03b1\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = K(\u03c3, I(\u03b1)\u03c4 )\nfor any words \u03b1, \u03c3, \u03c4 , where I(\u03b1) denotes the word obtained by writting \u03b1 in the\nreverse order. These kernels appear in many situations, see for instance [6] and [7].\nOur goal is to determine an explicit structure of the positive definite kernels satisfying the above invariance property. Since in the case N = 1 such kind of kernels\nare precisely the Hankel kernels, it is quite natural to consider associated orthogonal polynomials and to study their properties. Our main result establishes the\nconnection between moments and Jacobi coefficients, as a multivariable extension\nof a classical result. We also describe the Jacobi coefficients of the free products of\northogonal polynomials.\n2. Orthogonal polynomials\nWe introduce orthogonal polynomials on several hermitian variables and we discuss several general results. Especially, we emphasize the usefulness of a matrix\nnotation that reduces very much the degree of complexity and makes clear the\nanalogy with the classical, one-dimensional case. Let F+\nN be the unital free semigroup on N generators 1, . . . , N with lexicographic order \u227a. In particular, F+\n1 is\nthe set N0 of nonnegative integers. The set of positive integers will be denoted by\nN. The empty word is the identity element of F+\nN and the length of the word \u03c3 is\ndenoted by |\u03c3|. The length of the empty word is 0. There is a natural involution\n+\non F+\nN given by I(i1 . . . il ) = il . . . i1 as well as a natural action of FN on itself by\n+\njuxtaposition, (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2192 \u03c3\u03c4 , \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 FN . Let PN be the algebra of polynomials on\nN non-commuting indeterminates X1 ,. . .,XN with complex coefficients. For any\n\u03c3 = i 1 * * * i l \u2208 F+\nN , we define X\u03c3 = Xi1 * * * Xil . Using this notation, each element\nP \u2208 PN can be uniquely written as\nX\n(2.1)\nP =\nc\u03c3 X \u03c3 ,\n\u03c3\u2208F+\nN\n1\n\n\fwith only finitely many coefficients c\u03c3 different from zero. The length of the highest\n\u03c3 such that c\u03c3 6= 0 is the degree of P . We also have\nX\nX X\nc\u03c3 X \u03c3 ,\nP =\nPk =\nk\u22650\n\nk\u22650 |\u03c3|=k\n\nwhere each Pk belongs to the vector space LN\nk of homogeneous polynomials of degree\nk\nk \u2265 0 in N variables X1 , . . ., XN . The dimension of LN\nk is N . An involution +\n+\non PN can be introduced as follows: Xk = Xk , k = 1, . . . , N ; on monomials,\n(X\u03c3 )+ = XI(\u03c3) ; in general, if P has the representation as in (2.1) then\nX\n(2.2)\nP+ =\nc\u03c3 X\u03c3+ ,\n\u03c3\u2208F+\nN\n\nand PN is a unital, associative \u2217-algebra over C. Let \u03c6 be a strictly positive\nfunctional on PN , that is, \u03c6 is a linear unital map on PN and \u03c6(P + P ) > 0 for\nevery P \u2208 PN \u2212 {0}. The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction applied to \u03c6 gives a\nHilbert space H\u03c6 such that {X\u03c3 }\u03c3\u2208F+ is a linearly independent family in H\u03c6 . The\nN\nGram-Schmidt procedure gives a family {\u03c6\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208F+ of polynomials such that\nN\nX\n(2.3)\n\u03c6\u03b1 =\na\u03b1,\u03b2 X\u03b2 , a\u03b1,\u03b1 > 0;\n\u03b2\u0016\u03b1\n\n(2.4)\n\nh\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 i\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F+\nN,\n\nwhere for P1 , P2 \u2208 PN ,\nhP1 , P2 i\u03c6 = \u03c6(P2+ P1 ).\nThe elements \u03c6\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 F+\nN , will be called the orthonormal polynomials associated\nwith \u03c6. We notice that the use of the Gram-Schmidt process depends on the\norder chosen on F+\nN . A different order would give a different family of orthogonal\npolynomials. Due to the natural grading on F+\nN it is possible to develop a base\nfree approach to orthogonal polynomials. In the case of orthogonal polynomials\non several commuting variables this is presented in [8]. However, in this paper we\nconsider only the lexicographic order on F+\nN.\nThe moments of \u03c6 are\ns\u03c3 = \u03c6(X\u03c3 ), \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN,\nand we define the moment kernel of \u03c6 by the formula K\u03c6 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = sI(\u03b1)\u03b2 , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F+\nN.\n+\n+\nWe notice that K\u03c6 is a positive definite kernel on FN and for \u03b1, \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 FN ,\n(2.5)\n\nK\u03c6 (\u03b1\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = K\u03c6 (\u03c3, I(\u03b1)\u03c4 ).\n\nThis property can be viewed as a Hankel type condition. Conversely, it is easily\nseen that if a positive definite kernel K satisfies (2.5) then there exists a positive\nfunctional \u03c6 on PN such that K = K\u03c6 .\n2.1. Three term relations. Let \u03c6 be a unital strictly positive functional on PN\nand let {\u03c6\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208F+ be the orthonormal polynomials associated with \u03c6. As in the\nN\ncommutative case (see [8]), it is very convenient to use a matrix notation, \u03a6n =\n[\u03c6\u03c3 ]|\u03c3|=n for n \u2265 0 and \u03a6\u22121 = 0. With this notation, the analogy with the classical\n2\n\n\fcase N = 1 will be much more transparent. It turns out that the family {\u03a6n }n\u22650\nsatisfies a three-term recursive formula,\n(2.6)\n\nXk \u03a6n = \u03a6n+1 An+1,k + \u03a6n Bn,k + \u03a6n\u22121 A\u2217n,k ,\n\nfor k = 1, . . . , N and n \u2265 0 (see [5] and [2]). Each matrix Bn,k , n \u2265 0, k = 1, . . . , N ,\nis a selfadjoint N n \u00d7 N n matrix, while each An,k , n > 0, k = 1, . . . , N , is an\nN n \u00d7 N n\u22121 matrix such that\n\u0003\n\u0002\nAn = An,1 . . . An,N\n\nis an upper triangular invertible matrix for every n \u2265 0, with strictly positive\nelements on the diagonal. The fact that An is upper triangular comes from the\nlexicographic order that we use on F+\nN . The invertibility of Bn is a consequence\nof the fact that \u03c6 is strictly positive and appears to be a basic translation of this\ninformation. The diagonal of An is strictly positive since we chose a\u03b1,\u03b1 > 0. A\nfamily A = {An,k , Bm,k | n > 0, m \u2265 0, k = 1, . . . , N } of matrices satisfying all\nthese properties will be called admissible. It turns out that there are no other\nrestrictions on the matrices An,k , Bn,k as shown by the following Favard type\nresult mentioned in [5]. A similar result for the monic orthogonal polynomials,\n1\np\u03c3 =\n\u03c6\u03c3 was recently mentioned in [1].\na\u03c3,\u03c3\nP\n+\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u03c6\u03c3 =\n\u03c4 \u0016\u03c3 a\u03c3,\u03c4 X\u03c4 , \u03c3 \u2208 FN , be elements in PN such that\n\u03c6\u2205 = 1 and a\u03c3,\u03c3 > 0. Assume that there exists an admissible family A of matrices\nsuch that for k = 1, . . . , N and n \u2265 0,\nXk \u03a6n = \u03a6n+1 An+1,k + \u03a6n Bn,k + \u03a6n\u22121 A\u2217n,k ,\nwhere \u03a6n = [\u03c6\u03c3 ]|\u03c3|=n for n \u2265 0 and \u03a6\u22121 = 0. Then there exists a unique strictly\npositive functional \u03c6 on PN such that {\u03c6\u03c3 }\u03c3\u2208F+ is the family of orthonormal polyN\nnomials associated to \u03c6.\n\nThere is also a family of Jacobi matrices associated with the three-term relation\nin the following way. For P \u2208 PN define\n\u03a8\u03c6 (P )\u03c6\u03c3 = P \u03c6\u03c3 .\nSince the moment kernel has the Hankel type structure mentioned above in (2.5),\nit follows that each \u03a8\u03c6 (P ) is a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space H\u03c6 with\ndense domain PN . Moreover, for P, Q \u2208 PN ,\n\u03a8\u03c6 (P Q) = \u03a8\u03c6 (P )\u03a8\u03c6 (Q),\nand \u03a8\u03c6 (P )D \u2282 D, hence \u03a8\u03c6 is an unbounded representation of PN . Also, \u03c6(P ) =\nh\u03a8\u03c6 (P )1, 1i\u03c6 for P P\u2208 PN . We distinguish\nthe operators \u03a8k = \u03a8\u03c6 (Xk ), k =\nP\n1, . . . , N , since \u03a8\u03c6 ( \u03c3\u2208F+ c\u03c3 X\u03c3 ) = \u03c3\u2208F+ c\u03c3 \u03a8\u03c3 . Let {e1 , . . . , eN } be the stanN\n\nN\n\ndard basis of CN and define the unitary operator W from l2 (F+\nN ) onto H\u03c6 such\n+\n\u22121\nthat W (e\u03c3 ) = \u03c6\u03c3 , \u03c3 \u2208 FN . We see that W D is the linear space D0 generated by\ne \u03c3 , \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN , so that we can define\nJk = W \u22121 \u03a8k W,\n3\n\nk = 1, . . . , N,\n\n\fon D0 . Each Jk is a symmetric operator on D0 and by (2.6), the matrix of (the\nclosure of) Jk with respect to the orthonormal basis {e\u03c3 }\u03c3\u2208F+ is\nN\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u2217\nB0,k A1,k\n0\n...\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef A1,k B1,k A\u22172,k\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa.\nJk = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n.\n.\n\uf8ef 0\n. \uf8fa\nA2,k B2,k\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\nWe call (J1 , . . . , JN ) a Jacobi N -family on D0 . It turns out that the usual admissibility conditions on An,k and Bn,k insure a joint model of a Jacobi family in the\nfollowing sense.\nTheorem 2.2. Let (J1 , . . . , JN ) be a Jacobi N -family and assume that the corresponding A is an admissible family of matrices. Then there exists a unique strictly\npositive functional \u03c6 on PN with associated orthonormal polynomials {\u03c6\u03c3 }\u03c3\u2208F+\nN\n\n2 +\nsuch that the map W (e\u03c3 ) = \u03c6\u03c3 , \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN , extends to a unitary operator from l (FN )\nonto H\u03c6 and Jk = W \u22121 \u03a8k W for k = 1, . . . , N .\n\nFor details about the proof of this result see [5].\n2.2. Jacobi N -families and combinatorics of lattice paths. The matrices An,k and\nBn,k contain the whole information about the orthonormal polynomials (or the\nmoment kernel K\u03c6 ). Ususally they are called the Jacobi coefficients of K\u03c6 and can\nbe calculated from the moments. For instance,\n\u22121\nAn = [a\u03b1,\u03b2 ]|\u03b1|=|\u03b2|=n\n[a\u03b1,\u03b2 ]\u2295N\n|\u03b1|=|\u03b2|=n\u22121 ,\n\nwhere a\u03b1,\u03b2 are the coefficients of the orthogonal polynomials and for a matrix A\nwe use the notation\nA\u2295l = A\n. . \u2295 A} .\n| \u2295 .{z\nl times\nIn their turn, the coefficients a\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u0016 \u03b1, can be calculated from the formula\n\nwhere\n\n1\na\u03b1,\u03b2 = p\ndet [K(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )]\u03b1\u2032 \u227a\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2032 \u0016\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2032 6=\u03b2 ,\nD\u03b1\u22121 D\u03b1\nD\u03b1 = det [K(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )]\u03b1\u2032 ,\u03b2\u0016\u03b1 .\n\nThe formula for Bn,k is somewhat more involved and we do not record it here.\nInstead we consider a different kind of relation between moments and Jacobi coefficients which appears to be more explicit. The case N = 1 is classical, see [9], [10].\nThe Jacobi N -family (J1 , . . . , JN ) is a convenient tool to deal with this matter.\nThus, for any \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN we have that\ns\u03c3 = \u03c6(X\u03c3 ) = h\u03a8\u03c6 (X\u03c3 )1, 1i\u03c6 = h\u03a8\u03c3 1, 1i\u03c6 ,\nand by Theorem 2.2,\nh\u03a8\u03c3 1, 1i\u03c6 = hJ\u03c3 e0 , e0 i,\n4\n\n\ftherefore we have\n(2.7)\n\ns\u03c3 = hJ\u03c3 e0 , e0 i,\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN.\n\nNow we introduce some special paths on N0 \u00d7 {1, . . . , N } \u00d7 N0 . The allowed\nk\nsteps are the following: level steps ln,m\nfrom a point (n, k, m) to (n + 1, k, m), level\nn\nsteps lpm,k from a point (n, k, m) to (n, p, m), for some p \u2208 {1, . . . , N } \u2212 {k}, rise\nk\nk\nfrom a\nsteps rn,m\nfrom a point (n, k, m) to (n + 1, k, m + 1), and fall steps fn,m\npoint (n, k, m) to (n + 1, k, m \u2212 1) (see Figure 1 for an example).\n\u273b\n\n\u271f\u271f\u274f\n\u271f\n\u272f\n\u271f\n................\u271f\n................................................\u274f\n..........................................................\n\u271f\u2721\n.................\u271f\n..............\u2721\n...................................................................................................\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2732\n\nFigure 1.

We consider the\nset M\u03c3 of all paths that start at (0, ip , 0) and end at (|\u03c3|, i1 , 0), with the property\nthat the first kp steps belong to N0 \u00d7 {ip } \u00d7 N0 , the next kp\u22121 steps belong to\nN0 \u00d7 {ip\u22121 } \u00d7 N0 , and so on, until the last k1 steps which belong to N0 \u00d7 {i1 } \u00d7 N0 .\nThese sets are related to the set of Motzkin paths. The Motzkin paths of length n\nare the paths in N20 made of level, fall, and rise steps, starting at (0, 0) and ending\nat (n, 0). Their set is denoted by Mn and the number of elements of Mn is given\nby the Motzkin number\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1X n\nn\u2212k\nMn =\n.\nk\nk\u22121\nn\nk\n\nIt is easily seen that for any \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN \u2212 {\u2205} there is a bijection between M\u03c3 and\nM|\u03c3| . We can now describe a combinatorial structure of the moments.\n5\n\n\fTheorem 2.3. Let \u03c6 be a strictly positive functional on PN and let A be the\nadmissible family of matrices associated with \u03c6 by (2.6).

The claim is clearly true for |\u03c3| = 1 and then suppose it\ntrue for any word of length \u2264 n. Then consider a word \u03c3 of length n + 1. Several\ncases can occur.\nk\nCase 1. k = 0. Let \u03c3 = ik11 . . . ipp = i1 \u03c4 . First, assume k1 = 1. Due to the fact\nthat the level steps of type lp have weight I and by the induction hypothesis, we\ndeduce that the sum of the paths from Pj,ip to Q|\u03c3|,i1 ,0 is\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n,\n+ A\u22171,i1 J1,j\nB0,i1 J0,j\n\nwhich is precisely the (0, j) entry of the product\nJi1 J\u03c4 = J\u03c3 .\nThe case k1 > 1 is similar, just by the induction hypothesis we deduce that the\nsum of paths from Pj,ip to Q|\u03c3|,i1 ,0 is again\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n,\n+ A\u22171,i1 J1,j\nB0,i1 J0,j\n\nwhich is precisely the (0, j) entry of the product\nJi1 J\u03c4 = J\u03c3 .\nCase 2. j = 0 is similar.\nCase 3. k, j \u2265 1, then the induction hypothesis implies that the sum of paths\nfrom Pj,ip to Q|\u03c3|,i1 ,k is\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n,\n+ A\u2217k+1,i1 Jk+1,j\n+ Bk,i1 Jk,j\nAk,i1 Jk\u22121,j\n\nwhich is precisely the (k, j) entry of J\u03c3 .\n\n\u0003\n\nk\ndissapear, and our discussion\nWhen all Bn,k are zero, the level steps of type ln,m\nis somewhat related to parts of [11].\nFormula (2.8) can be also used to calculate the Jacobi coefficients from the\nmoments in a relatively simple way. Let \u03c3 \u2208 F+\nN \u2212 {\u2205}. It is convenient to introduce\nthe notation i(n) in order to denote the nth letter of the word \u03c3 (from left to right).\nIf |\u03c3| = 2n, then there exists a unique path p\u03c3 with corresponding weight\n\nA\u22171,i(i) . . .

Also, we introduce the notation: \u00c31 = A1 , and\nfor n \u2265 2,\n\u2295N n\u22121\n\u00c3n = An A\u2295N\n.\nn\u22121 . . . A1\nCorollary 2.4.

Free products\nThe set PN can be viewed as the free product of N copies of P1 :\n\u0001\nPN = P1 \u22c6 . . . \u22c6 P1 = C \u2295 \u2295n\u22651 \u2295i1 6=i2 ,...,in\u22121 6=in Pi01 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Pi0n ,\n{z\n}\n|\nN times\n\nwhere Pi0 is the set of polynomials in the variable Xi , i = 1, . . . , N , without constant\nterm. This remark suggests that the simplest examples of families of orthogonal\npolynomials can be obtained by using free products. Some examples already appeared in [1]. Here we describe a genreal construction. This allows to introduce\nmultivariable analogues of all classical orthogonal polynomials.\nThe simplest attempt to construct families of orthogonal polynomials on PN\nwould be to consider orthogonal polynomials associated with free products of positive functionals. Let \u03c61 and \u03c62 be two strictly positive functional on PN1 , respectively PN2 . Their free product \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u22c6 \u03c62 on PN1 \u22c6 PN2 is defined by \u03c6(1) = 1 and\n0\n,\n\u03c6(Pi1 . . .

By results in [3], [4], \u03c6 is a positive functional.\nHowever, as it turns out, \u03c6 is not strictly positive. Thus, consider the case of\ntwo strictly positive functionals \u03c61 and \u03c62 on P1 . Let K be the restriction of the\nmoment kernel K\u03c61 \u22c6\u03c62 to the set {1, 12}.

The case n \u2265 1 can be delt with in a similar manner.
