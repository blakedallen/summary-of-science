Intensive\nstudies during the past two decades show that much of the classical function theory\ncan be generalized to harmonic mappings (see the recent book of Duren [9] and the\nsurvey of Bshouty and Hengartner [7]). The purpose of this paper is to continue\nthe study of the subclass of quasiconformal and harmonic mappings, introduced by\nMartio in [31] and further studied for example in [32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 16, 2, 3, 19,\n20, 21, 17]. The above definition of a harmonic mapping extends in a natural way\nto the case of vector-valued mappings f : G \u2192 Rn , f = (f1 , . . . , fn ), defined on a\ndomain G \u2282 Rn , n \u2265 2.\nWe first recall the classical Schwarz lemma for the unit disk D = {z \u2208 C : |z| <\n1} :\n1.2. Lemma.\n|f (z)| \u2264 |z|, z \u2208 D .\n\nLet f : D \u2192 D be an analytic function with f (0) = 0 . Then\n\nFor the case of harmonic mappings this lemma has the following counterpart.\n1.3. Lemma. ([15], [9, p. 77]) Let f : D \u2192 D be a harmonic mapping with\nf (0) = 0 . Then |f (z)| \u2264 \u03c04 tan\u22121 |z| and this inequality is sharp for each point z \u2208 D .\n1\n\n\fThe classical Schwarz lemma is one of the cornerstones of geometric function theory and it also has a counterpart for quasiconformal maps ([1, 26, 41, 45]). Both for\nanalytic functions and for quasiconformal mappings it has a form that is conformally\ninvariant under conformal automorphisms of D .\nIn the case of harmonic mappings this invariance is no longer true. In general, if\n\u03c6 : D \u2192 D is a conformal automorphism and f : D \u2192 D is harmonic, then \u03c6 \u25e6 f is\nharmonic only in exceptional cases. Therefore one expects that harmonic mappings\nfrom the disk into a strip domain behave quite differently from harmonic mappings\nfrom the disk into a half-plane and that new phenomena will be discovered in the\nstudy of harmonic maps. For instance, it follows from Lemma 1.2 that holomorphic\nfunctions in plane do not increase hyperbolic distances. In general, planar harmonic\nmappings do not enjoy this property. On the other hand, we shall give here an\nadditional hypothesis under which the situation will change, in the plane as well\nas in higher dimensions. It turns out that the local uniform boundedness property,\nwhich we are going to define, has an important role in our study.\nFor a domain G \u2282 Rn , n \u2265 2, x, y \u2208 G, let\nrG (x, y) =\n\n|x \u2212 y|\nwhere d(x) = d(x, \u2202G) \u2261 inf{|z \u2212 x| : z \u2208 \u2202G} .\nmin{d(x), d(y)}\n\nIf the domain G is understood from the context, we write r instead rG . This quantity\nis used, for instance, in the study of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, cf.\n[45]. It is a basic fact that [43, Theorem 18.1] for n \u2265 2, K \u2265 1, c2 > 0 there\nexists c1 \u2208 (0, 1) such that whenever f : G \u2192 f G is a K-quasiconformal mapping\nwith G, f G \u2282 Rn then x, y \u2208 G and rG (x, y) \u2264 c1 imply rf G (f (x), f (y)) \u2264 c2 .\nWe call this property the local uniform boundedness of f with respect to rG . Note\nthat quasiconformal mappings satisfy the local uniform boundedness property and\nso do quasiregular mappings under appropriate conditions; it is known that one\nto one mappings satisfying the local uniform boundedness property may not be\nquasiconformal. We also consider a weaker form of this property and say that\nf : G \u2192 f G with G, f G \u2282 Rn satisfies the weak uniform boundedness property on\nG (with respect to rG ) if there is a constant c > 0 such that rG (x, y) \u2264 1/2 implies\nrf G (f (x), f (y)) \u2264 c . Univalent harmonic mappings fail to satisfy the weak uniform\nboundedness property as a rule, see Example 2.7 below.\nWe show that if f : G \u2192 f G is harmonic then f is Lipschitz w.r.t. quasihyperbolic metrics on G and f G if and only if it satisfies the weak uniform boundedness\nproperty; see Theorem 2.19. The proof is based on a higher dimensional version\nof the Schwarz lemma: harmonic maps satisfy the inequality (2.15) below. An inspection of the proof of Theorem 2.19 shows that the class of harmonic mappings\ncan be replaced by OC 1 class defined by (3.1) (see Section 3 below) and it leads to\ngeneralizations of the result; see Theorem 3.3.\nAnother interesting application is Theorem 2.22 which shows that if f is a harmonic K-quasiregular map such that the boundary of the image is a continuum\ncontaining at least two points, then it is Lipschitz. In Subsection 2.5, we study\nconditions under which a qc mapping is quasi isometry with respect to the corresponding quasihyperbolic metrics; see Theorems 2.25 and 2.31. In particular, using\na quasiconformal analogue of Koebe's theorem, cf. [4], we give a simple proof of the\nfollowing result, cf. [30, 33]: if D and D \u2032 are proper domains in R2 and h : D \u2192 D \u2032\n2\n\n\fis K-qc and harmonic, then it is bi-Lipschitz with respect to quasihyperbolic metrics\non D and D \u2032 .\nThe results in this paper may be generalized into various directions. One direction is to consider weak continuous solutions of the p-Laplace equation\ndiv(|\u2207u|p\u22122\u2207u) = 0,\n\n1 < p < \u221e,\n\nso called p-harmonic functions. Note that 2-harmonic functions in the above sense\nare harmonic in the usual sense.\nIt seems that the case of the upper half space is of particular interest, cf.\n[37, 33, 16, 3]. In Subsection 2.6, using Theorem 3.1 [23] we prove that if h is\na quasiconformal p-harmonic mapping of the upper half space Hn onto itself and\nh(\u221e) = \u221e, then h is quasi-isometry with respect to both the Euclidean and the\nPoincar\u00e9 distance.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nLipschitz property of harmonic maps w.r.t. quasihyperbolic metrics\nHyperbolic type metrics\n\nLet B n (x, r) = {z \u2208 Rn : |z \u2212 x| < r}, S n\u22121(x, r) = \u2202B n (x, r) and let Bn , S n\u22121 stand\nfor the unit ball and the unit sphere in Rn , respectively. Sometimes we write D\ninstead of B2 . For a domain G \u2282 Rn let \u03c1 : G \u2192 (0, \u221e) be a continuous function.\nWe say that \u03c1 is a weight function or a metric density if for every locally rectifiable\ncurve \u03b3 in G, the integral\nZ\nl\u03c1 (\u03b3) = \u03c1(x)ds\n\u03b3\n\nexists. In this case we call l\u03c1 (\u03b3) the \u03c1-length of \u03b3. A metric density defines a metric\nd\u03c1 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 (0, \u221e) as follows. For a, b \u2208 G, let\nd\u03c1 (a, b) = inf l\u03c1 (\u03b3)\n\u03b3\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all locally rectifiable curves in G joining a and\nb. For a fixed a, b \u2208 G , suppose that there exists a d\u03c1 -length minimizing curve\n\u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 G with \u03b3(0) = a, \u03b3(1) = b such that\nd\u03c1 (a, b) = l\u03c1 (\u03b3|[0, t]) + l\u03c1 (\u03b3|[t, 1])\nfor all t \u2208 [0, 1] . Then \u03b3 is called a geodesic segment joining a and b . It is an easy\nexercise to check that d\u03c1 satisfies the axioms of a metric. For instance, the hyperbolic\n(or Poincar\u00e9) metric of the unit ball Bn and the upper half space Hn = {x \u2208 Rn :\nxn > 0} are defined in terms of the densities \u03c1(x) = 2/(1 \u2212 |x|2 ) and \u03c1(x) = 1/xn ,\nrespectively. It is a classical fact that in both cases the length-minimizing curves,\ngeodesics, exist and that they are circular arcs orthogonal to the boundary [6]. In\nboth cases we have even explicit formulas for the distances:\nsinh\n\n|x \u2212 y|\n\u03c1Bn (x, y)\n,\n=p\n2\n(1 \u2212 |x|2 )(1 \u2212 |y|2)\n3\n\nx, y \u2208 Bn ,\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fand\ncosh \u03c1Hn (x, y) = 1 +\n\n|x \u2212 y|2\n,\n2xn yn\n\nx, y \u2208 Hn .\n\n(2.2)\n\nBecause the hyperbolic metric is invariant under conformal mappings, we may\ndefine the hyperbolic metric in any simply connected plane domain by using the\nRiemann mapping theorem, see for example [24]. The Schwarz lemma may now be\nformulated by stating that an analytic function from a simply connected domain\ninto another simply connected domain is a contraction mapping, i.e. the hyperbolic\ndistance between the images of two points is at most the hyperbolic distance between\nthe points. The hyperbolic metric is often the natural metric in classical function\ntheory. For the modern mapping theory, which also considers dimensions n \u2265 3 ,\nwe do not have a Riemann mapping theorem and therefore it is natural to look for\ncounterparts of the hyperbolic metric. So called hyperbolic type metrics have been\nthe subject of many recent papers. Perhaps the most important of these metrics are\nthe quasihyperbolic metric kG and the distance ratio metric jG of a domain G \u2282 Rn .\nThey are defined as follows.\n2.3. The quasihyperbolic and distance ratio metrics. Let G \u2282 Rn be\na domain. The quasihyperbolic metric kG is a particular case of the metric d\u03c1 when\n1\n(see [13, 12, 45]). It was proved in [12] that for given x, y \u2208 G , there\n\u03c1(x) = d(x,\u2202G)\nexists a geodesic segment of length kG (x, y) joining them. The distance ratio metric\nis defined for x, y \u2208 G by setting\njG (x, y) = log(1 + rG (x, y)) = log(1 +\n\n|x \u2212 y|\n)\nmin{d(x), d(y)}\n\nwhere rG is as in the Introduction. It is clear that\njG (x, y) \u2264 rG (x, y) .\nSome applications of these metrics are reviewed in [46]. The recent PhD theses [27],\n[24], [29] study the quasihyperbolic geometry or use it as a tool.\n2.4.\nR .\n\nLemma. ([13], [45, (3.4), Lemma 3.7]) Let G be a proper subdomain of\n\nn\n\n(a) If x, y \u2208 G and |y \u2212 x| \u2264 d(x)/2, then kG (x, y) \u2264 2jG (x, y) .\n\u0010\n\u0011\n|y\u2212x|\n(b) For x, y \u2208 G we have kG (x, y) \u2265 jG (x, y) \u2265 log 1 + d(x) .\n\n2.2\n\nQuasiconformal and quasiregular maps\n\n2.5. Maps of class ACL and ACLn .\nFor each integer k = 1, ..., n we denote\nRkn\u22121 = {x \u2208 Rn : xk = 0}. The orthogonal projection Pk : Rn \u2192 Rkn\u22121 , is given by\nPk x = x \u2212 xk ek .\nLet I = {x \u2208 Rn : ak \u2264 xk \u2264 bk } be a closed n-interval. A mapping f :\nI \u2192 Rm is said to be absolutely continuous on lines (ACL) if f is continuous and\nif f is absolutely continuous on almost every line segment in I, parallel to the\n4\n\n\fcoordinate axes. More precisely, if Ek is the set of all x \u2208 Pk I such that the function\nt 7\u2192 u(x + tek ) is not absolutely continuous on [ak , bk ], then mn\u22121 (Ek ) = 0 for all\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\nIf \u03a9 is an open set in Rn , a mapping f : \u03a9 \u2192 Rm is absolutely continuous if\nn\nf |I is ACL for every closed interval I \u2282 \u03a9. If \u03a9 and \u03a9\u2032 are domains in R , a\nhomeomorphism f : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 is called ACL if f |\u03a9 \\ {\u221e, f \u22121(\u221e)} is ACL.\nIf f : \u03a9 \u2192 Rm is ACL, then the partial derivatives of f exist a.e. in \u03a9, and they\nare Borel functions. We say that f is ACLn if the partials are locally integrable.\n2.6. Quasiregular mappings.\nLet G \u2282 Rn be a domain. A mapping\nn\nf : G \u2192 R is said to be quasiregular (qr) if f is ACLn and if there exists a constant\nK \u2265 1 such that\n|f \u2032(x)|n \u2264 KJf (x) , |f \u2032 (x)| = max |f \u2032(x)h| ,\n|h|=1\n\na.e. in G. Here f \u2032 (x) denotes the formal derivative of f at x , The smallest K \u2265 1\nfor which this inequality is true is called the outer dilatation of f and denoted by\nK O (f ). If f is quasiregular, then the smallest K \u2265 1 for which the inequality\nJf (x) \u2264 K l(f \u2032 (x))n , l(f \u2032 (x)) = min |f \u2032 (x)h| ,\n|h|=1\n\nholds a.e. in G is called the inner dilatation of f and denoted by K I (f ). The\nmaximal dilatation of f is the number K(f ) = max{ K I (f ), K O (f ) }. If K(f ) \u2264\nK, then f is said to be K\u2013quasiregular (K\u2013qr). If f is not quasiregular, we set\nK O (f ) = K I (f ) = K(f ) = \u221e .\nLet \u03a91 and \u03a92 be domains in Rn and fix K \u2265 1 . We say that a homeomorphism\nf : \u03a91 \u2192 \u03a92 is a K-quasiconformal (qc) mapping if it is K-qr and injective. Some\nof the standard references for qc and qr mappings are [11], [26], [43], and [45].\nThese mappings generalize the classes of conformal maps and analytic functions\nto Euclidean spaces. The K\u00fchnau handbook [25] contains several reviews dealing\nwith qc maps. It should be noted that various definitions for qc maps are studied\nin [43]. The above definition of K-quasiconformality is equivalent to the definition\nbased on moduli of curve families in [43, p. 42]. It is well-known that qr maps\nare differentiable a.e., satisfy condition (N) i.e. map sets of measure zero (w.r.t.\nLebesgue's n-dimensional measure) onto sets of measure zero. The inverse mapping\nof a K-qc mapping is also K-qc. The composition of a K1 -qc and of a K2 -qc map\nis a K1 K2 -qc map if it is defined.\n\n2.3\n\nExamples\n\nWe first show that, as a rule, univalent harmonic mappings fail to satisfy the local\nuniform boundedness property.\n2.7. Example . The univalent harmonic mapping f : H2 \u2192 f (H2 ) , f (z) =\narg z + i Imz, fails to satisfy the local uniform boundedness property with respect to\nrH 2 .\n\n5\n\n\fLet z1 = \u03c1ei\u03c0/4 , z2 = \u03c1ei3\u03c0/4 , w1 = f (z1 ) and w2 = f (z2 ). Then rH2 (z1 , z2 ) = 2\nand rf H2 (w1 , w2 ) = \u221a\u03c02 \u03c1 if \u03c1 is small enough and we see that f does not satisfy the\nlocal uniform boundedness property.\n2.8. Example.\nThe univalent harmonic mapping f : H2 \u2192 H2 , f (z) =\nRe z Im z+i Imz, fails to satisfy the local uniform boundedness property with respect\nto rH2 .\nFor a harmonic mapping f (z) = h(z) + g(z) , we introduce the following notation\n\u03bbf (z) = |h\u2032 (z)| \u2212 |g \u2032(z)| ,\n\n\u039bf (z) = |h\u2032 (z)| + |g \u2032(z)| and \u03bd(z) = g \u2032 (z)/f \u2032 (z).\n\nThe following Proposition shows that a one to one harmonic function satisfying\nthe local uniform boundedness property need not be quasiconformal.\n2.9. Proposition .\nThe function f (z) = log(|z|2 ) + 2iy is a univalent\nharmonic mapping and satisfies the local uniform boundedness property, but f is\nnot quasiconformal on V = {z : x > 1, 0 < y < 1}.\nProof. It is clear that f is harmonic in \u03a0+ = {z : Re z > 0}. Next f (z) =\nh(z) + g(z), where h(z) = logz + z and g(z) = logz \u2212 z. Since h\u2032 (z) = 1 + 1/z and\ng \u2032(z) = \u22121 + 1/z, we have |\u03bd(z)| < 1 for z \u2208 \u03a0+ .\nMoreover, f is quasiconformal on every compact subset D \u2282 \u03a0+ and \u03bbf , \u039bf are\nbounded from above and below on D. Therefore f is a quasi-isometry on D and by\nTheorem 2.19 below, f satisfies the local uniform boundedness property on D.\nFrom now on we consider the restriction of f to V = {z = x + iy : x > 1, 0 <\ny < 1}. Then f V = {w = (u, v) : u > log(1 + v 2 /4), 0 < v < 2} .\nWe are going to show that:\n\u2022 f satisfies the local uniform boundedness property, but f is not quasiconformal\non V .\nWe see that f is not quasiconformal on V , because |\u03bd(z)| \u2192 1 as z \u2192 \u221e, z \u2208 V .\nFor s > 1, define Vs = {z : 1 < x < s, 0 < y < 1}. Note that f is qc on Vs\nand therefore f satisfies the property of local uniform boundedness on Vs for every\ns > 1.\nWe consider separately two cases.\n\u0001\nCase A. z \u2208 V4 . If r > 1 is big enough, then d(z, \u2202Vr ) = d(z, \u2202V ) and d f (z), \u2202f (Vr ) =\nd(f (z), \u2202f (V )) and therefore f satisfies the property of local uniform boundedness\non V4 with respect to rV .\nCase B. It remains to prove that f satisfies the property of local uniform boundedness on V \\ V4 with respect to rV .\nObserve first that for z, z1 \u2208 V and |z1 | \u2265 |z| \u2265 1 , we have the estimate\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|z1 |\n|z1 |\n\u2264\n\u2212 1 \u2264 |z1 \u2212 z|,\nlog\n|z|\n|z|\nand therefore for z, z1 \u2208 V\n|f (z1 ) \u2212 f (z)| \u2264 4|z1 \u2212 z|.\n6\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fWe write\n\u2202V = [1, 1 + i] \u222a A \u222a B ; A = {(x, 0) : x \u2265 1} , B = {(x, 1) : x \u2265 1} .\nThen\n\u2202(f V ) = f (\u2202V ) \u2282 f [1, 1 + i] \u222a (f A) \u222a (f B)\nand by the definition of f we see that\nf A = {(x, 0) : x \u2265 0} ,\n\nf B = {(x, 2) : x \u2265 log 2},\n\nf [1, 1 + i] \u2282 [0, log 2] \u00d7 [0, 2] .\n\nClearly for w \u2208 f V\nd(w) = min{d(w, f A), d(w, f B), d(w, f [1, 1 + i])} ,\nand for Rew > 1 + log 2 and w \u2208 f V , we find\nd(w) = min{d(w, f A), d(w, f B)} .\n\n(2.11)\n\nFor z \u2208 V \\ V4 we have Ref (z) \u2265 log(16) > 1 + log 2 and therefore, in view of the\ndefinition of f , (2.11) yields d(f (z)) = 2d(z). This together with (2.10) shows that\nf satisfies the property of local uniform boundedness on V \\ V4 . \u0003\n\n2.4\n\nHigher dimensional version of Schwarz lemma\n\nBefore giving a proof of the higher dimensional version of the Schwarz lemma for\nharmonic maps we first establish some notation.\nn\nSuppose that h : B (a, r) \u2192 Rn is a continuous vector-valued function, harmonic\non B n (a, r), and let\nMa\u2217 = sup{|h(y) \u2212 h(a)| : y \u2208 S n\u22121 (a, r)}.\nLet h = (h1 , h2 , . . . , hn ).

Theorem. Suppose that h : D \u2192 R2 is harmonic and satisfies the\nweak uniform boundedness property.\n(c) Then h : (D, kD ) \u2192 (h(D), kh(D) ) is Lipschitz.\n(d) If, in addition, h is a qc mapping, then h : (D, kD ) \u2192 (h(D), kh(D) ) is a quasiisometry.\nProof. The part (d) is proved in [33].\nFor the proof of part (c) fix x \u2208 D and y \u2208 Bx = B(x, 14 d(x)). Then d(y) \u2265 34 d(x)\nand therefore r(x, y) < 1/2. By the hypotheses |h(y) \u2212 h(x)| \u2264 c d(h(x)).

Theorem. Suppose that G is a proper subdomain of Rn and h : G \u2192 Rn\nis a harmonic mapping. Then the following conditions are equivalent\n(1) h satisfies the weak uniform boundedness property.\n(2) h : (G, kG ) \u2192 (h(G), kh(G) ) is Lipschitz.\nProof. Let us prove that (1) implies (2).\nBy the hypothesis (1) f satisfies the weak uniform boundedness property: for\nevery x \u2208 G and t \u2208 Bx\n|f (t) \u2212 f (x)| \u2264 c2 d(f (x)) .\n(2.20)\nThis inequality together with Lemma 2.12 gives d(x)|f \u2032(x)| \u2264 c3 d(f (x)) for every\nx \u2208 G. Now an application of Lemma 2.16 shows that (1) implies (2).\n9\n\n\fIt remains to prove that (2) implies (1).\nSuppose that f is Lipschitz with the multiplicative constant c2 . Fix x, y \u2208 G\nwith rG (x, y) \u2264 1/2. Then |y \u2212 x| \u2264 d(x)/2 and therefore by Lemma 2.4\nkG (x, y) \u2264 2jG (x, y) \u2264 2 rG (x, y) \u2264 1.\nHence kG\u2032 (f x, f y) \u2264 c2 . Since jG\u2032 (f x, f y) \u2264 kG\u2032 (f x, f y) \u2264 c2 , we find jG\u2032 (f x, f y) =\nlog(1 + rG\u2032 (f x, f y)) \u2264 c2 and therefore rG\u2032 (f x, f y) \u2264 ec2 \u2212 1. \u0003\nSince f \u22121 is qc, an application of [12, Theorem 3] to f \u22121 and Theorem 2.19 give\nthe following corollary:\n2.21. Corollary. Suppose that G is a proper subdomain of Rn , h : G \u2192 hG\nis harmonic and K-qc. Then h : (G, kG ) \u2192 (h(G), kh(G) ) is a pseudo-isometry.\nIn [45, Example 11.4] (see also [44, Example 3.10]), it is shown that the analytic\nfunction f : D \u2192 G, G = D \\ {0}, f (z) = exp((z + 1)/(z \u2212 1)) , f (D) = G, fails to be\nuniformly continuous as a map\nf : (D, kD ) \u2192 (G, kG ) .\nTherefore bounded analytic functions do not satisfy the weak uniform boundedness\nproperty in general. The situation will be different for instance if the boundary of\nthe image domain is a continuum containing at least two points. Note that if kG is\nreplaced by the hyperbolic metric \u03bbG of G, then f : (D, kD ) \u2192 (G, \u03bbG ) is Lipschitz.\n2.22. Theorem. Suppose that G \u2282 Rn , f : G \u2192 Rn is K-qr and G\u2032 = f (G).\nLet \u2202G\u2032 be a continuum containing at least two distinct points. If f is a harmonic\nmapping, then f : (G, kG ) \u2192 (G\u2032 , kG\u2032 ) is Lipschitz.\nProof. Fix x \u2208 G and let Bx = B n (x, d(x)/4). If |y \u2212 x| \u2264 d(x)/4, then\nd(y) \u2265 3d(x)/4 and therefore,\nrG (y, x) \u2264\n\n4 |y \u2212 x|\n.\n3 d(x)\n\nBecause jG (x, y) = log(1 + rG (x, y)) \u2264 rG (x, y), using Lemma 2.4(a), we find\nkG (y, x) \u2264 2 jG (y, x) \u2264 2/3 < 1.\nBy [45, Theorem 12.21] there exists a constant c2 > 0 depending only on n and\nK such that\nkG\u2032 (f y, f x) \u2264 c2 max{kG (y, x)\u03b1 , kG (y, x)}, \u03b1 = K 1/(1\u2212n) ,\nand hence, using Lemma 2.4(b) and kG (y, x) \u2264 1, we see that\n|f y \u2212 f x| \u2264 ec2 d(f x),\n\ni.e. Mx = \u03c9f (x) \u2264 ec2 d(f x).\n10\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fBy (2.15) applied to Bx = B n (x, d(x)/4), we have\n1\nd(x)|f \u2032 (x)| \u2264 2Mx\n4\nand therefore using the inequality (2.23), we have\n1\nd(x)|f \u2032 (x)| \u2264 2 c d(f (x)),\n4\nwhere c = ec2 ; and the proof follows from Lemma 2.16. \u0003\nThe first author has asked the following Question (cf.

Let z \u2208 D and h = f + g be a local representation of h on Bz , where f and\ng are analytic functions on Bz , \u039bh (z) = |f \u2032 (z)| + |g \u2032(z)|, \u03bbh (z) = |f \u2032 (z)| \u2212 |g \u2032 (z)| and\nK\u22121\nk = K+1\n.\nSince h is K- qc, we see that\n(1 \u2212 k 2 )|f \u2032 |2 \u2264 Jh \u2264 K|f \u2032 |2\n\n(2.27)\n\non Bz and since log |f \u2032 (\u03b6)| is harmonic,\n1\nlog |f (z)| =\n2|Bz |\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nBz\n\nlog |f \u2032 (\u03b6)|2d\u03be d\u03b7 .\n\nHence, using the right hand side of (2.27), we find\nZ\n1\n1\nlog |f \u2032(\u03b6)|2d\u03be d\u03b7\nlog ah,D (z) \u2264 logK +\n2\n2|Bz | Bz\n\u221a\n= log K |f \u2032 (z)| .\nHence,\nah,D (z) \u2264\n\n\u221a\n\n12\n\nK |f \u2032(z)|\n\n(2.28)\n(2.29)\n\n\fand in a similar way using the left hand side of (2.27), we have\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 k 2 |f \u2032 (z)| \u2264 ah,D (z) .\n\nNow, an application of the Astala-Gehring result gives\n\u039bh (z) \u224d\n\nd(hz, \u2202D \u2032 )\n\u224d \u03bbh (z) .\nd(z, \u2202D\n\nThis pointwise result, combined with Lemma 2.16 (integration along curves),\neasily gives\nkD\u2032 (h(z1 ), h(z2 )) \u224d kD (z1 , z2 ),\n\nz1 , z2 \u2208 D .\n\n\u0003\nNote that in [30] the proof makes use of the interesting fact that log J1h is a\nsubharmonic function; but we do not use it here.\nDefine mf (x, r) = min{|f (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)| : |x\u2032 \u2212 x| = r}.\nSuppose that G and G\u2032 are domains in Rn : If f : G \u2192 G\u2032 is K- quasiconformal;\nby the distortion property we find mf (x, r) \u2265 a(x)r 1/\u03b1 . Hence, as in [20] and [36] ,\nwe get:\n2.30. Lemma. If f \u2208 C 1,1 is a K\u2212 quasiconformal mapping defined in a\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 Rn (n \u2265 3), then\nJf (x) > 0,\n\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nprovided that K < 2n\u22121 . The constant 2n\u22121 is sharp.\n2.31. Theorem. Under the hypothesis of the lemma, if G \u2282 \u03a9, then f is\nbi-Lipschitz with respect to Euclidean and quasihyperbolic metrics on G and G\u2032 =\nf (G).\nProof. Since G is compact Jf attains minimum on G at a point x0 \u2208 G. By\nLemma 2.30, m0 = Jf > 0 and therefore since f \u2208 C 1,1 is a K\u2212 quasiconformal, we\nconclude that functions |fxk |, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n are bounded from above and below on G;\nhence f is bi-Lipschitz with respect to Euclidean metric on G.\nBy Theorem 2.24, we find af,G p\n\u2248 d\u2217 /d, where d(x) p\n= d(x, \u2202G) and d\u2217 (x) =\n\u2032\nn\nJf \u2248 af , we find n Jf \u2248 d\u2217 /d on G. An\nd(f (x), \u2202G ). Since we have here\napplication of Theorem 2.25 completes the proof. \u0003\n\n2.7\n\nThe upper half space Hn .\n\nLet Hn denote the half-space in Rn . If D is a domain in Rn , by QCH(D) we denote\nthe set of Euclidean harmonic quasiconformal mappings of D onto itself.\nIn particular if x \u2208 R3 , we use notation x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and we denote by\n\u2202xk f = fx\u2032 k the partial derivative of f with respect to xk .\n1\n1\nA fundamental solution in space R3 of the Laplace equation is |x|\n. Let U0 = |x+e\n,\n3|\nwhere e3 = (0, 0, 1). Define h(x) = (x1 + \u03b51 U0 , x2 + \u03b52 U0 , x3 ). It is easy to verify that\nh \u2208 QCH(H3 ) for small values of \u03b51 and \u03b52 .\n13\n\n\fUsing the Herglotz representation of a nonnegative harmonic function u (see\nTheorem 7.24 and Corollary 6.36 [5]), one can get:\nLemma A. If u is a nonnegative harmonic function on a half space Hn , continuous up to the boundary with u = 0 on Hn , then u is (affine) linear.\nIn [33], the first author has outlined a proof of the following result:\nTheorem A. If h is a quasiconformal harmonic mapping of the upper half space\nHn onto itself and h(\u221e) = \u221e, then h is quasi-isometry with respect to both the\nEuclidean and the Poincar\u00e9 distance.\nNote that the outline of proof in [33] can be justified by Lemma A.\nWe show that the analog statement of this result holds for p-harmonic vector\nfunctions (solutions of p-Laplacian equations) using the mentioned result obtained\nin the paper [23], stated here as:\nTheorem B. If u is a nonnegative p-harmonic function on a half space Hn ,\ncontinuous up to the boundary with u = 0 on Hn , then u is (affine) linear.\n2.32. Theorem. If h is a quasiconformal p-harmonic mapping of the upper\nhalf space Hn onto itself and h(\u221e) = \u221e, then both h : (Hn , | * |) \u2192 (Hn , | * |) and\nh : (Hn , \u03c1Hn ) \u2192 (Hn , \u03c1Hn ) are bi-Lipschitz where \u03c1 = \u03c1Hn is the P oincar\u00e9 distance.\nSince 2-harmonic mapping are Euclidean harmonic this result includes Theorem\nA.\n\nProof. It suffices to deal with the case n = 3 as the proof for the general case\nis similar. Let h = (h1 , h2 , h3 ).\nBy Theorem B, we get h3 (x) = ax3 , where a is a positive constant. Without loss\nof generality we may suppose that a = 1.\nSince h3 (x) = x3 , we have \u2202x3 h3 (x) = 1, and therefore |h\u2032x3 (x)| \u2265 1. In a similar\nway, |gx\u2032 3 (x)| \u2265 1, where g = h\u22121 . Hence, there exists a constant c = c(K),\n|h\u2032 (x)| \u2264 c and 1/c \u2264 l(h\u2032 (x)) .\nTherefore partial derivatives of h and h\u22121 are bounded from above; and, in particular, h is Euclidean bi-Lipschitz.\nSince h3 (x) = x3 ,\n|h\u2032 (x)|\nc\n\u2264 ;\nh3 (x)\nx3\n\nand hence, by Lemma 2.16, \u03c1(h(a), h(b)) \u2264 c\u03c1(a, b) . \u0003\n\n3\n\nPseudo-isometry and OC 1(G)\n\nIn this section, we give a sufficient condition for a qc mapping f : G \u2192 f (G) to be a\npseudo-isometry w.r.t. quasihyperbolic metrics on G and f (G). First we adopt the\nfollowing notation.\nIf V is a subset of Rn and u : V \u2192 Rm , we define\noscV u = sup{|u(x) \u2212 u(y)| : x, y \u2208 V } .\n14\n\n\fSuppose that G \u2282 Rn and Bx = B(x, d(x)/2). Let OC 1 (G) denote the class of\nf \u2208 C 1 (G) such that\n(3.1)\nd(x)|f \u2032(x)| \u2264 c1 oscBx f\n\nfor every x \u2208 G. Similarly, let SC 1 (G) be the class of functions f \u2208 C 1 (G) such\nthat\n|f \u2032(x)| \u2264 ar \u22121 \u03c9f (x, r) for all B n (x, r) \u2282 G,\n(3.2)\nwhere \u03c9f (x, r) = sup{|f (y) \u2212 f (x)| : y \u2208 B n (x, r)}.\n\nThe proof of Theorem 2.19 gives the following more general result:\n3.3. Theorem. Suppose that G \u2282 Rn , f : G \u2192 G\u2032 , f \u2208 OC 1 (G) and it\nsatisfies the weak property of uniform boundedness with a constant c on G. Then\n(e) f : (G, kG ) \u2192 (G\u2032 , kG\u2032 ) is Lipschitz.\n(f) In addition, if f is K-qc, then f is pseudo-isometry w.r.t. quasihyperbolic\nmetrics on G and f (G).\nProof. By the hypothesis f satisfies the weak property of uniform boundedness:\n|f (t) \u2212 f (x)| \u2264 c2 d(f (x) for every t \u2208 Bx , that is\noscBx f \u2264 c2 d(f (x))\n\n(3.4)\n\nfor every x \u2208 G. This inequality together with (3.1) gives d(x)|f \u2032 (x)| \u2264 c3 d(f (x)).\nNow an application of Lemma 2.16 gives part (e). Since f \u22121 is qc, an application of\n[12, Theorem 3] on f \u22121 gives part (f). \u0003\nIn order to apply the above method we introduce subclasses of OC 1 (G) (see, for\nexample, below (3.5)).\nLet f : G \u2192 G\u2032 be a C 2 function and Bx = B(x, d(x)/2). We denote by OC 2(G)\nthe class of functions which satisfy the following condition:\nsup d2 (x)|\u2206f (x)| \u2264 c oscBx f\n\n(3.5)\n\nBx\n\nfor every x \u2208 G.\nIf f \u2208 OC 2 (G), then by Theorem 3.9 in [14], applied to \u03a9 = Bx ,\nsup d(t)|f \u2032 (t)| \u2264 C(sup |f (t) \u2212 f (x)| + sup d2 (t)|\u2206f (t)|)\n\nt\u2208Bx\n\nt\u2208Bx\n\nt\u2208Bx\n\nand hence by (3.5)\nd(x)|f \u2032(x)| \u2264 c1 oscBx f\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor every x \u2208 G and therefore OC 2 (G) \u2282 OC 1(G).\nNow the following result follows from the previous theorem.\n3.7. Corollary. Suppose that G \u2282 Rn is a proper subdomain, f : G \u2192 G\u2032 is\nK-qc and f satisfies the condition (3.5). Then f : (G, kG ) \u2192 (G\u2032 , kG\u2032 ) is Lipschitz.\n\n15\n\n\fWe will now give some examples of classes of functions to which Theorem 3.3 is\napplicable. Let SC 2 (G) denote the class of f \u2208 C 2 (G) such that\n|\u2206f (x)| \u2264 ar \u22121 sup{|f \u2032 (y)| : y \u2208 B n (x, r)},\nfor all B n (x, r) \u2282 G, where a is a positive constant. Note that the class SC 2 (G)\ncontains every function for which d(x)|\u2206f (x)| \u2264 a|f \u2032 (x)|, x \u2208 G. It is clear that\nSC 1 (G) \u2282 OC 1 (G) and by the mean value theorem, OC 2(G) \u2282 SC 2 (G). For example, in [39] it is proved that SC 2 (G) \u2282 SC 1 (G) and that the class SC 2 (G) contains\nharmonic functions, eigenfunctions of the ordinary Laplacian if G is bounded, eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic Laplacian if G = Bn and thus our results are applicable\nfor instance to these classes.\nAcknowledgements.
