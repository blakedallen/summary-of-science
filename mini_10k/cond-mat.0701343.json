Kamien and Andrea J. Liu\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA\n(Dated: October 15, 2018)\nWe link the thermodynamics of colloidal suspensions to the statistics of regular and random packings. Random close packing has defied a rigorous definition yet, in three dimensions, there is near universal agreement\non the volume fraction at which it occurs. We conjecture that the common value of \u03c6rcp \u2248 0.64 arises from a\ndivergence in the rate at which accessible states disappear. We relate this rate to the equation of state for a hard\nsphere fluid on a metastable, non-crystalline branch.\n\nWhen Bernal turned to sphere packings as a route towards\nunderstanding liquids [1], he recognized the importance of the\nrandom close-packing density, \u03c6rcp . This density was defined\noperationally to be the fraction of occupied volume in the\ndensest disordered packing of hard spheres. Early measurements of \u03c6rcp by Scott [2] and Bernal and Mason [3] involved\npouring, shaking and kneading ball bearings in flasks and balloons. Since then, these measurements have been reproduced\nby countless experiments and numerical algorithms, which\nfind a common value of \u03c6rcp \u2248 0.64 in three dimensions [4].\nThere are therefore many distinct but numerically-consistent\ndefinitions of \u03c6rcp that depend on procedure. At the time\nof Scott's experiments, Bernal and Mason wrote, \"The figure for the occupied volume of random close packing\u20130.64\u2013\nmust be mathematically determinable, although so far as we\nknow undetermined.\" [3]. Nearly fifty years later, however, a\nmathematically-rigorous definition of random close-packing\nstill remains elusive. Why should an ill-defined state have a\nreproducibly accepted value for its volume fraction?\nTwo approaches towards a mathematically-rigorous definition have been suggested recently. Torquato, et al. [5]\npointed out that there is an inherent discrepancy in the concept of a \"random close-packed state,\" because one can always obtain a more closely-packed state (a denser state) by\nintroducing order into the system. This must be true because \u03c6rcp is lower \u221a\nthan the maximum close-packed density [6], \u03c6FCC = \u03c0/3 2 \u2248 0.74, corresponding to the closepacked FCC crystal. Torquato, et al. [5] proposed an alternate way of thinking about random close-packing, in terms of\na \"maximally-random jammed\" (MRJ) state at \u03c6rcp . \"Maximally random\" states or configurations are those with minimal\nvalues of typical order parameters, such as bond-orientational\norder or crystalline order. \"Jammed\" states have the property\nthat any particle or set of particles cannot be translated with\nrespect to any of the rest of the particles in the system without introducing overlaps. Kansal, et al. [7] showed that several different order parameters yielded consistent estimates for\nthe packing fraction of the maximally random jammed state,\n\u03c6MRJ \u2248 0.63, in good agreement with \u03c6rcp . This is very\nencouraging. Nonetheless, there is some uncertainty in this\napproach associated with the order parameter; one cannot calculate all possible order parameters, or determine that all order\nparameters yield the same MRJ packing fraction. Moreover,\nthere may be a specific type of order associated with the MRJ\nstate [8, 9, 10, 11], which would then be maximal rather than\nminimal in the MRJ state, though these special metrics are\n\nlikely to be of a different nature from those studied in [5].\nA second approach by O'Hern, et al. is based on the energy\nlandscape of systems of soft spheres. Specifically, Refs. [11,\n12] considered potentials of the form\n\u001a\n\u01eb(1 \u2212 r/\u03c3)\u03b1 /\u03b1 for r < \u03c3\nV (r) =\n(1)\n0\nfor r \u2265 \u03c3\n\nHere, \u01eb is the characteristic energy of interaction and \u03c3 is the\nparticle diameter. For \u03b1 = 3/2, \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b1 = 5/2, O'Hern,\net al. studied the fraction of ideal gas states f0 (\u03c6) that belong\nto basins of attraction corresponding to zero energy states (or\nequivalently, allowed hard sphere states). It was found that\n\u2212df0 (\u03c6)/d\u03c6, i.e. the rate at which the fraction of ideal gas\nstates belonging to basins of attraction of hard sphere states\nshrinks with increasing density, appears to develop a deltafunction peak at \u03c6rcp in the infinite system size limit [11, 12].\nThus, they suggest that in the thermodynamic limit, the vast\nmajority of ideal gas states belong to basins of attraction of\nhard sphere states that jam at \u03c6rcp . Here, a state is \"jammed\"\nif there are no zero frequency vibrational modes except for\nthose due to floaters (particles with no overlapping neighbors)\nor overall translation and rotation of the system [13]. The\nuncertainty in this approach is associated with how the energy\nlandscape is explored [14, 15]; different algorithms may yield\ndifferent final energy minima for a given ideal gas state.\nIn this paper, we exploit a relation that has been used to\ncalculate the pressure of a system to explore the connection\nbetween the pressure \u2013 a thermodynamic quantity that can be\nmeasured for colloidal suspensions \u2013 and the behavior of hard\nsphere packings. In particular, we show that the fractional\nrate at which allowed states disappear with increasing volume\nfraction is proportional to the pressure. We also show that free\nvolume theory provides a reasonable fit to the equation of state\nof the hard sphere liquid, with a single fit parameter \u03c6max ,\ncorresponding to the density at which the pressure diverges.\nWe find that \u03c6max = 0.640\u00b1.006, in excellent agreement with\n\u03c6rcp . We conclude by discussing these results in the context\nof previous work and making some conjectures regarding the\norigin of the reproducibility of \u03c6rcp .\nWe first derive a useful relation between the pressure and\nthe rate at which allowed states disappear. This relation has\nbeen used to calculate the pressure from a Monte Carlo run\nfor hard particles by calculating the minimum density change\nneeded to introduce overlaps between particles [16]. Here,\nwe use the relation to gain insight into the packings of hard\nspheres. We consider the number of available states as a function of volume fraction \u03c6 = \u03c1v, where \u03c1 is the number density\n\n\f2\nof spheres and v is their volume. We consider the probability\nof finding an allowed hard sphere state at \u03c1,\nR(\u03c1) = ZHS (\u03c1)/ZIG (\u03c1),\n\n(a)\n\n(2)\n\n30\n\nwhere ZHS and ZIG are the numbers of allowed configurations (or equivalently, the canonical partition functions) for\nhard spheres and for an ideal gas of point particles, respectively. We now consider the effect of increasing the volume fraction of a particular state at density \u03c1. The probability of not finding a new state at \u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1, given this state\n1 \u2202R\nat \u03c1, is J(\u03c1)\u03b4\u03c1, where J(\u03c1) = \u2212 R\n\u2202\u03c1 . Using the thermodynamic definition of pressure, p \u2261 T \u2202 ln Z/\u2202V , we find\nV\nJ(\u03c1) = \u03c1T\n[pHS (\u03c1) \u2212 pIG (\u03c1)] , where pHS and pIG are the\npressures of the hard sphere and ideal gas systems, respectively, V is the volume and T is the temperature (the Boltzmann constant is unity). Equivalently,\n\n25\n\nJ(\u03c6) =\n\nV\n[pHS (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03c6T /v] .\n\u03c6T\n\nT \u03c62 d\nln{[(\u03c6max /\u03c6)1/D \u2212 1]D }\nv d\u03c6\n\n15\n10\n5\n\nCarnahan-Starling\n\u03c6=0.6465 free volume theory\n\u03c6=0.635 free volume theory\nRutgers, et al.\nRintoul and Torquato\nSpeedy\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n(b)\n150\n\n(3)\n\nIn Fig. 1(a) we show the experimentally-measured equation of state for a hard sphere system (circles) [17]. The\npressure increases with \u03c6 until \u03c6X \u2248 0.49, at which point\nfluid and crystal begin to coexist. At \u03c6 \u2248 0.54 the system\nis completely \u221a\ncrystalline and pHS (\u03c6) eventually diverges at\n\u03c6FCC = \u03c0/3 2 \u2248 0.74, the packing fraction of the closepacked FCC lattice. Eq. (3) implies that J(\u03c6) also diverges\nat \u03c6FCC , signaling an inability to construct any higher density\nstates, i.e. close packing. Thus, if all the states are counted in\nZHS , J does not diverge until \u03c6F CC .\nThere is also a metastable branch of the equation of state\nthat is reproducibly measurable numerically (see Fig. 1)\n[18, 19] and potentially measurable experimentally in rapidly\nsedimented colloidal suspensions [20]. This branch is used to\nstudy the colloidal glass transition [21] and dynamics in granular media [22]. Along this branch, the pressure apparently\ndiverges[18, 19] at \u03c6rcp as pHS (\u03c6) \u223c (\u03c6rcp \u2212 \u03c6)\u22121 . Such a\ndivergence is predicted on the basis of polytope theory, or free\nvolume theory, for classical hard spheres [8, 23]. According\nto Eq. (3), this would lead to a divergence in J there. To\nconstruct an analytical approximation to a metastable branch\nthat continues smoothly from \u03c6X to a divergence at some\n\u03c6max , we therefore turn to free volume theory. To calculate\nthe free energy within free volume theory, we must construct\nthe Voronoi tesselation for any particular packing [24]. For\na given packing, each sphere is allowed to independently explore the free volume of its cell. The free energy involves a\nsum over all possible tesselations and requires knowledge of\nthe distribution of free volumes [25]. However, the change\nof free energy with \u03c6, or the pressure, should not depend on\nthe tesselation sufficiently close to \u03c6max . If \u03c6 is decreased infinitesimally near \u03c6max , the increase in free volume of each\ncell for an isotropic, affine rarefaction of the packing scales as\n\u0002\n\u00033\n(\u03c6max /\u03c6)1/3 \u2212 1 as long as the shape of each free volume\nregion remains fixed. Thus, near \u03c6max , the pressure depends\non only one free parameter, \u03c6max :\npFV = \u2212\n\n20\n\n(4)\n\n100\n\n50\n\nCarnahan-Starling\n\u03c6=0.6465 free volume theory\n\u03c6=0.640 free volume theory\nRutgers, et al.\nRintoul and Torquato\nSpeedy\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 1: (Color Online) Measured equation of state p (in units of \u03c1T )\nversus volume fraction \u03c6 for a hard sphere fluid from experiments by\nRutgers, et al.

Note that as the volume fraction further decreases, the geometry of the allowed\nvolume will change and, though the scaling factor remains the\nsame, the prefactor will change, leading to additional corrections. Recent arguments [26] based on statistical geometry\nsuggest that Eq. (4) should be at least approximately correct\nfor the metastable branch.\nFig. 1(a) shows that free volume theory provides a very\nreasonable fit to the equilibrium liquid branch of the data of\nRef. [17] just below \u03c6X , with \u03c6max \u2248 0.64 in 3D, in excellent agreement with measured RCP values. The inset shows\nthat \u2206, the mean-squared error, is a strong function of \u03c6max .\nWe find a comparable value of \u03c6max \u2248 0.636 when we fit\nthe range \u03c6 \u2208 [0.3, 0.5] to the first ten virial coefficients [27].\n\n\f3\nUnsurprisingly, we also find a similar value (\u03c6max \u2248 0.635)\nwhen we fit to the Carnahan-Starling approximate equation of\nstate [28]. The latter function is known to describe experimental or numerical measurements of the liquid branch of the\nequation of state to within measurement error [17, 29, 30, 31].\nIt is worth noting that the fitted values of \u03c6max are insensitive to the region over which we fit the data. Using the entire\nequilibrium liquid branch \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 0.5] only changes \u03c6max in\nthe last decimal place when fitting to the experimental data,\nthe virial expansion, or the Carnahan-Starling approximation\n(for example, we obtain \u03c6max \u2248 0.637 when fitting to the\nCarnahan-Starling equation over the whole range). Aste and\nConiglio [32] have used local random configurations of hard\nspheres to estimate the pressure in free volume theory and\nthere, too, find an independent branch of the equation of state\ndiverging at \u03c6max \u2248 0.65.\nWe have also fit free volume theory to numerical measurements of the metastable branch [18, 19]. Here we find that the\nbest fit corresponds to \u03c6max \u2248 0.6465\u2013less than 2% higher\nthan the result for the fit to the equilibrium liquid branch. In\nFig. 1(a), we plot Eq. (4) for both \u03c6max = 0.635 (solid) and\n\u03c6max = 0.646 (dotted); these curves are nearly indistinguishable in terms of their ability to fit the equilibrium portion of\nthe curve. In Fig. 1(b), we plot the same data and fits over a\nnarrower range of \u03c6 and larger range of pressure to show the\nquality of the fit to the metastable branch. Note that our oneparameter fit reproduces not only the shape of the divergence\nbut the overall amplitude of the pressure reasonably well. The\nfinal value \u03c6max = 0.640 \u00b1 0.006 represents the range of fit\nvalues that we obtain, though the metastable branch strongly\nfavors the high end of this range, as seen in Fig. 1(b).\nWe now note that the many different algorithms and preparation methods that yield \u03c6rcp \u2248 0.64, have one point in\ncommon: they all contrive to avoid crystallization and should\nthus correspond to a metastable branch of the pressure. For\ntwo very different approaches, conjugate gradient minimization [11, 12] and the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm [8, 33],\nthere is good evidence that the accessible states follow the\nbranch estimated in Fig. 1. Both procedures yield a pair correlation function g(r) that diverges at contact as |\u03c6rcp \u2212 \u03c6|\u22121 ,\nimplying a likewise diverging pressure. These approaches\nboth observe a catastrophic loss of states, i.e. they jam, at\n\u03c6rcp , consistent with Eq. (1).\nThese results suggest that \u03c6rcp corresponds to a divergent\nendpoint of a metastable branch of the equation of state for\nhard spheres. This provides another way of thinking about\nwhy random close-packing has not been a well-defined concept [5]. It is well understood that metastable branches are\nsomewhat arbitrary. To obtain metastable branches, one must\nintroduce additional constraints that effectively exclude certain states (such as crystalline states) from the partition function [34]. Different choices of constraints lead to different\nmetastable branches. Alternatively, one can think in terms of\nthe Andreev-Fisher droplet model [35, 36], or the instanton\napproach to first-order transitions [37], which predict an essential singularity at the onset of crystallization, \u03c6X . This essential singularity precludes analytic continuation of the pressure beyond \u03c6X ; physically, droplets of the nucleating crys-\n\ntalline phase prevent the clean definition of the metastable\nbranch.\nThe possibility of multiple metastable branches leads to the\npossibility of multiple divergent endpoints. The existence of\nmultiple divergent endpoints is strongly suggested by results\nof Torquato, et al. [5] using the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm [33]. In this algorithm, one starts with an equilibrium\nliquid configuration at low volume fraction and compresses\nby increasing the diameters of all the particles at some rate \u0393.\nThe system jams at some packing fraction \u03c6f (\u0393), which approaches \u03c6rcp from above in the limit \u0393 \u2192 \u221e. This suggests\nthat one can find metastable branches that end at any value of\n\u03c6 between \u03c6rcp and \u03c6FCC \u2248 0.74.\nTorquato, et al. [5] have suggested that the state at \u03c6rcp is\nspecial in the sense that it corresponds to a \"maximally random jammed\" state [5]. It seems reasonable that this concept should be generalizable to an entire \"maximally-random\njammed\" metastable branch of the pressure that ends at \u03c6rcp .\nThis is the philosophy underlying calculations of Rintoul and\nTorquato [18], who followed a metastable branch of the pressure by discarding all states with appreciable values of the\nbond orientational order parameter. In that case, they found a\ndiverging pressure at \u03c6rcp .\nAnother possibility that is not inconsistent with the scenario\nof Torquato, et al. is that \u03c6rcp might be better defined than\nthe metastable branch that it terminates. It might correspond\nto a true singularity of the free energy that is inaccessible in\nequilibrium due to the essential singularity at \u03c6X , the onset\nof crystallization. Exact analyses of one-dimensional models show that it is possible for a system to have a metastable\nbranch that is not well-defined but that ends in a divergent\nendpoint that is a true singularity [38].\nWe therefore conjecture that \u03c6rcp represents a special welldefined divergent endpoint of a set of metastable branches of\nthe pressure. Any procedure that samples a nonzero fraction\nof states belonging to metastable branches with this endpoint\nwill yield a divergent pressure, and therefore a divergent rate\nat which states disappear, at \u03c6rcp . If this conjecture is correct, it would explain why so many different procedures, all\nsampling states somewhat differently, yield the same value of\n\u03c6rcp . At the same time, it is clear that other procedures might\nyield different jamming densities by avoiding states that belong to metastable branches with endpoints at \u03c6rcp .\nBased on results for hard spheres obtained from replica theory, Parisi and Zamponi [39, 40] have suggested a similar but\nmore elaborate scenario. In this picture, \u03c6rcp is the divergent\nendpoint of a metastable branch, but there is also an another\npoint on the branch, \u03c6g < \u03c6rcp , which marks a thermodynamic glass transition. Above \u03c6g , the configurational entropy\nvanishes; the system must remain in the lowest free energy\nstates and the relaxation time is infinite. This scenario is not\ninconsistent with our conjecture.\nA singularity in the rate of change of number of states does\nnot necessarily imply that most initial states will flow to \u03c6rcp .\nIt is possible that most states might have their jamming thresholds at values of \u03c6 below \u03c6rcp , leaving only a few that terminate at \u03c6rcp . Numerical results suggest that the opposite might\nbe true. Indeed, they suggest that \u03c6rcp may not only mark a\n\n\f4\nwell-defined divergent endpoint of a set of metastable equations of state, but that an even stronger condition might hold:\nthe distribution of jamming thresholds may actually have a divergent maximum at \u03c6rcp in the thermodynamic limit. This\nconjecture is motivated by results of O'Hern, et al. [11, 12],\nwhich suggest that for several soft repulsive potentials, the\noverwhelming number of ideal gas states belong to basins of\nattraction of hard sphere states that have their jamming thresholds at \u03c6rcp . Note that the probability of belonging to a basin\nof attraction of a state with a jamming threshold at \u03c6 depends\non both the size distribution of basins of attraction and the\ndistribution of jamming thresholds. For small systems, Xu, et\nal. [41] have separated the these two distributions by explicitly enumerating the jamming thresholds; their results suggest\nthat the distribution of jamming thresholds is maximal near\n\u03c6rcp , consistent with this conjecture. While it is unlikely that\nthe maxima of the distributions of jamming thresholds and of\njamming thresholds weighted by their basin of attractions and\nthe divergent endpoint of the metastable branch all coincide\nat exactly the same density, it is possible that they agree with\n\u03c6 = 0.64 to within 1-2%, so that any one of these could constitute a reasonable definition of \u03c6rcp [42].\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\nJ.D.

(2), the ratio of hard\nsphere states to the total number of ideal gas states at a\ngiven \u03c6, includes not only hard sphere states at their jamming\nthresholds at \u03c6 but also hard sphere states below their jamming thresholds. In this paper, we have argued that the form\nof the equilibrium equation of state suggests that at \u03c6rcp , the\nlatter states completely dwarf the number of hard sphere states\nthat are at their jamming thresholds, hiding the divergence in\nthe pressure. It is only when these more ordered states are\nexcluded by restricting the system to a metastable branch of\nthe pressure that a signature of \u03c6rcp appears. This reasoning\nsuggests that a clean definition of \u03c6rcp will rely not only on\nthe distribution of jamming thresholds, but the number of allowed hard sphere states at their jamming thresholds at \u03c6rcp\nas a function of system size [43].\nWe thank M.E.
