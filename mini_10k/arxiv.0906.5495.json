Comets: individual: C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) \u2013 Radio lines: solar system \u2013 Techniques: interferometric\n\n1. Introduction\nMillimetre spectroscopy provided many insights into the\ncomposition and physical properties of cometary atmospheres. Many cometary parent molecules issued from the\nnucleus were identified with this technique. The high spectral resolution capabilities, and the possibility to observe\nseveral rotational lines belonging to the same molecule,\nallowed us to retrieve unique information concerning the\nvelocity and temperature of the expanding coma, and\nthe anisotropy of gas production at the nucleus surface.\nBecause of the low, diffraction-limited spatial resolution\nprovided by radio dishes at millimetric wavelengths, at best\ntypically 10\u2032\u2032 , studies concerning the spatial distribution of\nparent molecules in the coma were sparse.\nThe exceptional brightness of comet C/1995 O1 (HaleBopp) near its perihelion on 1 April, 1997, motivated a\nwealth of innovative cometary observations. Among them,\ninterferometric imaging of rotational transitions of parent molecules was successfully attempted. The BerkeleyIllinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array mapped comet\nHale-Bopp in HCN J(1\u20130) and CS J(2\u20131) with 9\u2032\u2032 anguSend offprint requests to: D.\ndominique.bockelee@obspm.fr\n\u22c6\ndeceased\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan,\n\ne-mail:\n\nlar resolution. Spatial asymmetries suggesting the presence\nof gas jets were detected (Veal et al., 2000; Wright et al.,\n1998; Woodney et al., 2002). Constraints on the photodissociative scalelengths of HCN and CS were obtained from\nthe radial extent of their radio emissions (Snyder et al.,\n2001). Using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)\nmillimetre array, Blake et al. (1999) obtained maps of\nHCN, DCN, HNC and HDO at 2\u20134\u2032\u2032 spatial resolutions over\n2\u20133 h integration time. The presence of arc-like structures\noffset from the nucleus is reported for all species but HCN,\nand interpreted in terms of jets of icy particles releasing\nunalterated gas contrasting with that outgassed from the\nnucleus.\nInterferometric observations of rotational lines in comet\nHale-Bopp were also made with the Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) of the Institut de Radio Astronomie\nMillim\u00e9trique (IRAM) at 1\u20133\u2032\u2032 resolution. A short and\npreliminary account of these observations was given in\nWink et al. (1999), Despois (1999) and Henry et al. (2002).\nMillimetre lines of CO, HCN, CS, HNC, CH3 OH, H2 S,\nSO, H2 CO were mapped (Wink et al., 1999; Boissier et al.,\n2007). At the same time, continuum maps of the dust and\nnucleus thermal emissions were obtained (Altenhoff et al.,\n1999). The PdBI was also used in single-dish mode to\n\n\f2\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\ndetect new cometary molecules (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.,\n2000; Crovisier et al., 2004a,b).\nWe present here observations of the CO J(1\u20130) (115\nGHz) and J(2\u20131) (230 GHz) lines performed on 11 March,\n1997 at the Plateau de Bure interferometer. Among the\n\u223c20 molecules identified in comet Hale-Bopp, and more\ngenerally in cometary atmospheres, carbon monoxyde CO\nis of particular interest:\n1. This species is the main agent of distant cometary activity, as first evidenced in comet 29P/SchwassmannWachmann 1 (Senay & Jewitt, 1994; Crovisier et al.,\n1995). This was later confirmed in comet Hale-Bopp\nfrom its long-term monitoring, which showed the change\nfrom a CO-dominated to an H2 O-dominated activity at\nheliocentric distances rh \u223c 3\u20134 AU (Biver et al., 1997,\n1999a).\n2. In comets within 3 AU from the Sun, CO is, most\noften, the second major gaseous component of the\ncoma after water. CO production rates relative to water are highly variable from comet to comet, ranging from less than 1 % to \u223c 20 % (Irvine et al., 2000;\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al., 2004, for a review). That measured in comet Hale-Bopp near perihelion is among\nthe highest ever observed in comets: \u223c 20 % (e.g.,\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al., 2000; DiSanti et al., 2001).\n3. There is much debate on CO production mechanisms.\nBecause CO has a low sublimation temperature, the nucleus surface is certainly deprived of CO ice. Therefore,\nCO should outgass at some depth inside the nucleus, possibly from pure CO ice sublimation and/or\nfrom amorphous water ice when crystallizing and releasing trapped molecules (e.g., Enzian et al., 1998;\nCapria et al., 2000, 2002), if indeed pre-cometary ices\ncondensed in amorphous form, which is somewhat debated (Mousis et al., 2000). Another mechanism proposed to explain the CO production of comet HaleBopp near perihelion is the release of CO trapped\nin crystalline water ice during water ice sublimation\n(Capria et al., 2000, 2002). Comparing the CO jets morphology, as the nucleus rotates, to those of less volatile\nspecies or dust might provide clues to the origin of CO.\n4. There are several observational evidences that a significant part of the CO observed in cometary atmospheres could be produced by a distributed source.\nFrom in situ measurements of the local CO density\nin 1P/Halley with Giotto, Eberhardt et al. (1987) concluded that only about 1/3 of the CO originated from\nthe nucleus. The spatial distribution of CO molecules\ndeduced from infrared long-slit observations of comet\nHale-Bopp led DiSanti et al. (1999, 2001) to suggest\nthat one-half of the CO was released by a distributed\nsource when comet Hale-Bopp was within 1.5 AU from\nthe Sun. The spatial resolution of the CO maps obtained at PdBI, approximately 1 000 km to 1700 km\nradius on the comet depending of the line observed,\nis below the estimated radial extension of the CO\ndistributed source of \u223c 5 \u00d7 103 km (DiSanti et al.,\n2001; Brooke et al., 2003). Therefore, an important aspect of the study of the CO PdBI interferometric\ndata is that independent information concerning the\nexistence of a CO distributed source in Hale-Bopp\ncoma can be possibly obtained. The study of the radial distribution of the CO molecules is presented in\n\na separate paper (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan & Boissier, 2009).\nThe brightness distribution of both 115 GHz and\n230 GHz lines can be fully explained by pure\nnuclear CO production, provided that opacity effects and temperature variations in the coma are\ntaken into account (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al., 2005;\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan & Boissier, 2009).\nThe observations of the CO J(1\u20130) and J(2\u20131) lines,\nperformed both in single-dish and interferometric modes,\nare presented in Sect. 2. They show evidence for a rotating CO jet. A model simulating a CO spiralling jet when\nthe nucleus is rotating is developed in Sect. 3. It allowed\nus to compute synthetic spectra, visibilities and interferometric maps as a function of time, to be compared to the\nobservations. Observations are analysed in Sect.4, and the\nmodel free parameters are retrieved. A discussion is given\nin Sect. 5.\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. Description\nComet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) was observed from 6 March\nto 22 March, 1997 with the Plateau de Bure interferometer\nof IRAM, located in the French Alps. The observations of\nthe J(2\u20131) (230.538 GHz) and J(1-0) (115.271 GHz) CO\nrotational transitions were carried out on 11 March, from\n4h to 15h UT. On this day, comet Hale-Bopp was at the\ngeocentric distance \u2206 = 1.368 AU and heliocentric distance\nrh = 0.989 AU. The weather conditions were good to excellent and the atmospheric seeing was \u223c0.4 \u2032\u2032 for both 1.3\nand 3 mm receivers.\nThe comet was tracked using orbital elements provided\nby D.K. Yeomans (JPL, solution 55). The ephemeris was\ncomputed by P. Rocher (IMCCE, Observatoire de Paris)\nwith a program which takes into account planetary perturbations. The first interferometric maps obtained on 9\nMarch (HCN J(1\u20130) line) revealed that both continuum\nand molecular peak intensities were offset by about 5\u2013\n6\u2032\u2032 North in declination (Dec) from the nucleus position\nprovided by the ephemeris. Observations on March 11 were\nmade with the ephemeris corrected by 6\u2032\u2032 North in Dec.\nThe PdBI was used in the compact configuration C1\n(see Fig. 1) with five 15-m antennas providing 10 baselines\n(the spacing between two antennas) ranging from \u223c20 to\n\u223c150 m. In 1997, the PdBI comprised a flexible spectral\ncorrelator made of six independent units, providing correlated spectra with 64 to 256 channels spaced by 0.039 MHz\nto 2.5 MHz. We used 256 channels of 78 kHz separation\nfor the observations of the 230 GHz line, and 256 channels\nof 39 kHz separation for those of the 115 GHz line. The\nfour other units were used for the continuum observations\npresented in Altenhoff et al. (1999). The effective spectral\nresolution is a factor of 1.3 broader than the channel spacing, and corresponds to \u223c 0.13 km s\u22121 for both lines.\nThe observing cycle was : pointing, focusing, 4 min\nof cross-correlation on the calibrators (2200+420 BL Lac,\nMWC349 and 3C373), 2 min of autocorrelation, and 51\none minute scans of cross-correlation on the comet interlaced with scans on the phase calibrator (2200+420 BL\nLac) observed every 20 min. The cycle was completed by\nanother 2 min of autocorrelation on Hale-Bopp. For the autocorrelation observations (in this mode, the five antennas\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nFig. 1.

Reduction and cleaning of the maps were performed with the MAPPING/GILDAS software1.\nConcerning ON\u2013OFF spectra, antenna temperatures TA\u2217\nwere converted into main beam brightness temperatures\nTmB through TmB = TA\u2217 Feff /Beff with beam efficiencies Beff\nof 0.83 (115 GHz) and 0.58 (230 GHz), and forward efficiencies Feff of 0.93 (115 GHz) and 0.89 (230 GHz). Flux density\nper beam (S in Jy) is then related to antenna temperature\nthrough S/TA\u2217 = (2k\u03a9mB /\u03bb2 )Feff /Beff = 19.61Feff /Beff ,\nwhere \u03a9mB is the main beam solid angle.\nFor both ON\u2013OFF and interferometric data, the uncertainties in flux calibration are at most 10% and 15% for the\nJ(1\u20130) and J(2\u20131) lines, respectively. The r.m.s in phase\nnoise ranges from 10 to 27\u25e6 at 230 GHz and from 4.6 to\n20\u25e6 at 115 GHz, depending of the baseline.\nThe cross-correlated spectra produce, for each spectral\nchannel, interferometric maps with spatial resolutions corresponding to the uv-coverage (Fig. 2). When all crosscorrelation data are considered, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the synthesized beam is 2.00\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.38\u2032\u2032\nwith major axis at position angle pa = 99.56\u25e6 at 230 GHz,\nand 3.58\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2.57\u2032\u2032 with pa = 86.00\u25e6 at 115 GHz. The\nFWHM of the primary beam of the antennas is 20.9\u2032\u2032 at\n230 GHz and 41.8\u2032\u2032 at 115 GHz.\n2.2.

Calibration was done with the IRAM\n\nON\u2013OFF spectra of the CO J(2\u20131) line are shown in\nFig. 3a. The integration time is 2 minutes (on+off) for\neach spectrum. They show a feature moving from positive\nto negative velocities, and to positive velocities again, with\nrespect to the nucleus velocity frame. In other words, a jetlike CO gas feature, which velocity vector with respect to\nEarth rotated during the course of the observations, is observed. This CO gas feature contributes up to 28% of the\ntotal line area.\nThe synodic rotation period of comet Hale-Bopp in\nFebruary\u2013April 1997 has been deduced from studies of the\ndust shells (Sarmecanic et al., 1997; Farnham et al., 1999;\nOrtiz & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, 1999). The most accurate value P =\n11.31 \u00b1 0.01 hr measured by Farnham et al. (1999) is in\nagreement with a slightly larger sidereal rotation period\nP = 11.34 \u00b1 0.02 hr (Licandro et al., 1998; Jorda et al.,\n1999). Figure 4 plots the evolution of the line velocity\nshift (the spectrum first order momentum) with time. The\npoints follow a sinusoidal curve which period corresponds\nto the comet's nucleus rotation (taken to be equal to\n11.35 hr throughout this paper). The sinusoid determined\nfrom a least-squares fit with fixed period P = 11.35 h\nhas a mean level of v0 = \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.01 km s\u22121 and its\namplitude is A = 0.29\u00b10.03 km s\u22121 (Fig. 4). The line\narea does not show significant variation with time, with\na mean value of 4.22 \u00b1 0.03 K km s\u22121 in main beam\nbrightness temperature scale TmB (i.e., 82.8 Jy km s\u22121 in\nflux density scale). Fluctuations of \u223c10% at most are observed (with a standard deviation of 5%), which are not\ncorrelated with the velocity shift variations. The velocity shift curve obtained for the J(1\u20130) line is much more\nnoisy (error bars \u223c0.2 km s\u22121 on the individual spectra),\nbut is similar to the J(2\u20131) velocity shift curve: a leastsquares sinusoid fit with P fixed to 11.35 h leads to A =\n1\n\nhttp://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nAntenna temperature [K]\n\n4\n\nVelocity [km s 1 ]\nFig. 3.

The line area of the\nJ(1\u20130) line is 0.552 \u00b1 0.022 K km s\u22121 in the TmB scale (i.e.,\n10.8 Jy km s\u22121 ).\nFrom the spin axis orientation and the equatorial coordinates of the comet, it is possible to derive the angle \u03b8\u03c9\n(aspect angle) between the spin axis and the line of sight,\nand the North pole position angle pa\u03c9 , defined from North\nto East. The different spin orientations published in the\nliterature are listed in Table 1.\nAdopting the spin orientation derived by Jorda et al.\n(1999) and Schleicher et al. (2004), the comet spin axis was\nthen only 20\u25e6 far from the plane of the sky. In such a geometrical configuration, a polar CO jet would lead to an almost constant velocity shift. A jet close to the equator can\nexplain a velocity shift following a sinusoid centred around\nv0 \u223c 0 km s\u22121 . Both this sinusoidal curve and the constant\n\nCO line area show that the amount of CO gas released in\nthis jet did not vary during nucleus rotation. Given the\nSun direction (phase angle of 46\u25e6 , pa = 160\u25e6), this nearequatorial CO jet was active night and day at about the\nsame extent.\nFrom the line areas of the J(1\u20130) and J(2\u20131) ON\u2013OFF\n1\nprofiles,\nwe derive a CO production rate QCO = 2.1 \u00d71030\n\u22121\ns . Here, we have assumed a Haser parent molecule distribution for CO, and run our excitation model (Sect. 3)\nwith a kinetic temperature T of 120 K which agrees with\ntemperature determinations pertaining to the 10 000\u201320 000\nkm (radius) coma region sampled by the primary beam of\nPdBI (Biver et al., 1999a; DiSanti et al., 2001). Using an\nextended production for CO consistent with the IR observations does not significantly affect the inferred QCO .\nDiSanti et al. (2001) inferred a total CO production rate\n(nuclear+distributed) fully consistent with our value. In\nthe following sections, we will assume T = 120 K and a\ntotal QCO of 2 \u00d71030 s\u22121 .\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

Interferometric data\nWe present in Fig. 5 the line integrated maps of CO J(2\u20131)\nand J(1\u20130). 8 hours of observations were averaged (from\n4.5 h UT to 12.5 h UT) and 25 velocity channels (12 on\nboth sides the central channel corresponding to the nucleus\nvelocity) were co-added. An asymmetrical shape, which\nis not aligned with the elliptical clean beam (the synthesized interferometer beam), is observed and related to the\nanisotropy of the gas emission.\nIn the line integrated interferometric map of CO J(2\u2013\n1) (Fig. 5), the position of the peak brightness ( Cm ) is\nat RA = 22h 30m 38.02s and Dec = 40\u25e6 46\u2032 3.1\u2032\u2032 (with an\nastrometric precision of 0.07\u2032\u2032 ) in apparent geocentric coordinates given for 7.00 h UT. The peak position of the\nCO J(1\u20130) brightness (RA = 22h 29m 38.46s and Dec =\n40\u25e6 41\u2032 10.1\u2032\u2032 at 4.00 h UT) is consistent with that of J(2\u2013\n1), taking into account the comet motion from 4 to 7 h\n\nFig. 5. CO J(1\u20130) (top) and J(2\u20131) (bottom) line integrated maps observed on 11 March, 1997 (all data). 25 spectral channels have been averaged. The synthesized beam is\nin the lower left. The dashed square on the J(1\u20130) map corresponds to the size of the J(2\u20131) map. For the CO J(1\u20130)\nline, contours are 0.037 Jy/beam, and the r.m.s. is 0.018\nJy/beam. For the J(2\u20131) line, contours are 0.186 Jy/beam\nand the r.m.s. is 0.066 Jy/beam. Iso-contours are successive\nmultiples of 10% of the maximum intensity, at 10 to 100 %\nof the maximum intensity. The solar direction is indicated.\nThe original images have been shifted so that the maximum\nbrightness peaks at the centre of the maps. In units of line\narea, the intensities at maximum brightness are 0.93\u00b10.04\nand 4.65\u00b10.15 Jy km s\u22121 for the J(1\u20130) and J(2\u20131) lines,\nrespectively.\n\n\f6\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nFig. 6.

The synthesized beam is in\nthe lower left, and is coloured according to the velocity value. J(1\u20130) line (top): contour interval is 0.053 Jy/beam and\nthe r.m.s. is 0.046 Jy/beam.

For each map labelled (i) on the top left corners, a crosse locates the\nmean photometric centre Cm determined from the whole data set. The arrow represents the direction of the individual\nphotometric centre Ci with respect to Cm . Ci is evaluated by fitting a 2-D Gaussian of adjustable width. The beam shape\nis shown in the bottom right corner.\n\nFig. 8. Time evolution of the photometric centres.\nPhotometric centres Ci , with i refering to the maps shown\nin Fig. 7, are given with their errorbars. The ellipse drawn\nis a least-squares fit to the data. It corresponds to a parallel of latitude 10\u25e6 North of a sphere, with spin axis aspect\nangle = 80\u25e6 and position angle = 211\u25e6.\n\nUT (see Boissier et al., 2007). The peak position of the\ncontinuum emission at 230 GHz observed simultaneously\nalso almost coincides (0.2\u2032\u2032 offset) with the CO J(2\u20131) peak\n(Altenhoff et al., 1999; Boissier et al., 2007). Using orbital\nelements based on optical astrometric positions from April\n1996 to August 2005 (JPL solution 220), the offset between\nthe CO peak and the ephemeris is +2.9\u2032\u2032 in Dec and +0.4\u2032\u2032\nin RA. So, positions of the CO and radio continuum brightness peaks differ by typically +3\u2032\u2032 in Dec from optical astrometric positions. A bright dusty jet was identified southward in the optical images of comet Hale-Bopp near perhelion (e.g., Jorda et al., 1999). As shown by Boissier et al.\n(2007), the optical astrometric positions were more af-\n\nfected by dusty jets than the radio positions. Boissier et al.\n(2007) showed that the astrometric positions provided by\nthe IRAM continuum radio maps provides an orbit which\ndoes not require the existence of non-gravitational forces\nacting on the Hale-Bopp nucleus, in contrast to those derived from only optical positions, thereby solving a contentious issue. In conclusion, there is no substantial offset\nbetween the nucleus position and the mean photometric\ncentre of CO emission.\nThe J(1\u20130) and J(2\u20131) spectral channel maps (Fig. 6)\nwere obtained with the same procedure. The peak brightness on the blue channels is stronger than that on the red\nones. This indicates more emission toward the Earth and is\nrelated to the jet seen in ON\u2013OFF spectra. Indeed, the interferometric observations covered only 2/3 of the nucleus\nrotation period, when the jet was, most of the time, facing the Earth (Fig. 4). The spectral maps show that the\nCO coma structure is complex. The interpretation of the\nbrightness distribution on these maps is not straightforward, since the signal is here averaged over the entire period of observation and the CO coma is rotating. The most\ncentral channels are sensitive to molecules expanding along\ndirections close to the plane of the sky. They show coma\nstructures towards North-West and South-East quadrants\n(roughly along a direction perpendicular to the projected\nrotation axis, see the 230 GHz maps in Fig. 6). These structures may trace the jet at the time it was near the plane of\nthe sky. Channels at high negative velocities (\u20130.6 to \u20130.9\nkm s\u22121 ) show a much brighter and strongly peaked intensity distribution because the jet is here facing the Earth.\nIn order to investigate whether there is temporal evidence for the rotating jet in the images of the CO emission,\nwe have combined the data into five parts of about 1 hour\neach. Resulting maps are presented in Fig. 7. Because of\nEarth rotation, the beam shape rotates with time from map\nto map and changes dimension (see next paragraph). This\nprevents a detailed study of the rotating jets directly from\nthe maps and, as explained later, another approach will be\nused. However, an interesting feature is observed. From the\nobservations averaged over the whole day, we have derived\nthe mean photometric centre of CO emission, Cm . For each\nmap i, we can also derive the photometric centre, Ci , and\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nthe vector Ji = Cm Ci , as shown in Fig. 7. The time evolution of Ji is presented in Fig. 8. We observe that it moves\ncounterclockwise (disregarding C5 ) along an ellipse which\n\n\f8\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nFig. 9. Time evolution of the visibility amplitudes with respect to the uv-radius \u03c3. Different symbols are used for the\ndifferent baselines. For some baselines, the arrow shows the direction of time evolution of the uv-radius. The uncertainties\non the data points due to thermal and phase noise range from 0.29 to 0.65 Jy km s\u22121 . Phase noise affects the uncertainties\nby 2% (short baselines) to 10% (long baselines). The mean error bar (\u00b1 0.40 Jy km s\u22121 ) is quoted on the figure. The\ndashed curve is a least-squares fit of a power law to the data.\nlong axis is perpendicular to the spin axis direction. Such a\ndisplacement is that expected in presence of a CO rotating\njet. Provided Cm coincides with the nucleus position, Ji reflects the jet direction on map i. For a spherical nucleus and\nconstant jet activity, the Ci 's locus should be then an ellipse\nwhich long axis position angle is perpendicular to the spin\naxis, the other characteristics of the ellipse (axis lengths,\ncentroid) being related to the amount of CO gas inside the\njet, as well as to its latitude on the nucleus surface. A leastsquares fit of the photometric centres leads to an ellipse\n(Fig. 8) that corresponds to a spin axis with position angle\npa\u03c9 = 211\u25e6 and aspect angle \u03b8\u03c9 = 79\u25e6 , in good agreement\nwith most of the published values (Table 1). The ellipse dimensions and position inferred from the fit do not provide\ndirect quantitative information on the jet relative strength\nand latitude because the nucleus position may be off by\na fraction of an arcsec with respect to Cm . However, the\nsignificant displacement of the photometric centre during\nnucleus rotation excludes a high-latitude jet, in agreement\nwith the conclusion obtained from the ON\u2013OFF spectra.\nThe small offset between Cm and the nucleus position (as\ndetermined from the peak of the continuum emission) is\nalso consistent with a low-latitude jet.\nFor a deeper study of the interferometric data, we have\ndecided to work on complex visibilities in the uv-plane.\nFor readers not familiar with interferometry, let us explain\nbriefly what this means and how maps are obtained. An\n\ninterferometer measures the Fourier transform (FT) of the\nsource brightness distribution on the sky. The complex visibilities V(u, v) sample the FT at points (u, v) in the Fourier\nplane, also called the uv-plane. These points are the projections of the baselines onto the plane of the sky and define the uv-coverage of the observations (Fig. 2). As the\nEarth rotates, the locus of the points (u, v) produced by\none baseline\nis an arc of ellipse. Therefore, the uv-radius\n\u221a\n\u03c3 = u2 + v 2 changes with time (except if the source\nobserved is circumpolar, because the locus is then a circle). The longer we observe, the longer are these arcs, the\nlarger is the uv-plane coverage (see Thompson et al., 1991,\nchap. 4, \u00a74.2). (In fact, the uv-coverage produced by a couple of antennas comprises two arcs of ellipse symmetrical\nwith respect to the centre (u, v) = (0, 0); this is because\nthe source brightness distribution is a real function, so its\nFT verifies V(u, v) = V(\u2212u, \u2212v).) In order to make a map,\none has first to compute the inverse Fourier transform of\nthe sampled signal. In a second time, this dirty map is deconvolved from the dirty beam, which is the FT of the uvcoverage. Because the uv-plane is not regularly covered, interpolations are made when performing the FT. In addition,\nwhen the uv-coverage is highly anisotropic, the dirty beam\npresents intense sidelobes, which might not be properly accounted for in the deconvolution step. This might result\nin the apparition of artefacts. The anisotropic uv-coverage\nalso results in an elliptical clean beam.\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\n9\n\nSince the individual baselines have different directions\nand lengths, they probe different scales and regions of the\ncoma. So, visibilities have to be studied for each baseline\nseparately. We plot in Fig. 9 the time evolution of the visibility amplitude V\u0304 of the CO J(2\u20131) line with respect to\nthe uv-radius \u03c3. The visibilities have been integrated over\nvelocity and have units of line area. Let us assume that the\nline is optically thin and its excitation does not vary within\nthe field of view. For an isotropic coma described by a parent molecule distribution, the visibility curve would follow\nV\u0304(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3 \u22121 , provided the photodissociation scale length is\nlarge compared to the field of view, which is the case here\n(Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan & Boissier, 2009). We observe in Fig. 9\nsome modulations with respect to the mean evolution (in\n\u03c3 \u22121.18 ) that are not due to noise. They cannot be due to\nvariations of the activity of the comet since the area of the\nline, observed in ON\u2013OFF mode, is roughly constant with\ntime. Furthermore, modulations do not present the same\nbehaviour from one baseline to another.\nWe presented in Fig. 3b\u2013d spectra issued from the three\nshortest baselines of the interferometer. As on the ON\u2013OFF\nspectra (Fig. 3a), we can see spectral features moving from\nred to blue velocities. Figure 10 presents the time evolution\nof the interferometric velocity shifts. At least for the five\nshortest baselines, they can be fitted by sinusoids of period\nequal to the nucleus rotation period. We observe that these\ncurves are not in phase. As the baselines do not have the\nsame length, nor the same orientation, this phase difference\nmay suggest that the CO jet is spiralling and detected at\ndifferent times with the various baselines. A straight jet\nwould produce velocity shift curves in phase.\nThe next section presents a model with a rotating gas\njet aimed at the interpretation of these data.\n\n3. Model\nThe model is a static 3-dimensional model simulating a\nspiralling gas jet. It computes uv-tables (i.e., visibilities)\ncorresponding to the observational conditions of the data,\nthat is with the same uv-coverage. The time evolution of\nthe coma is simulated by computing a serie of successive\nstatic uv-tables.\nThe CO coma is modelled as a combination of an\nisotropic outgassing and a gas jet defined by:\n\u2013 its half-width \u03a8;\n\u2013 its latitude l on the nucleus, assumed to be spherical;\n\u2013 the fraction fco of the CO released within the jet.\nThe model parameters are summarized in Table 2.\nThe coordinate frame (Oxyz) used in the calculations\nhas its origin at the comet nucleus with the z-axis along the\nline of sight opposite to the Earth, and the x and y-axes\npointing East and North in the plane of the sky. r0 is the\nnucleus radius. The jet direction at the nucleus surface J 0\nis (\u03b80 , \u03c60 )t in the (Oxyz) frame at time t (usual spherical\ncoordinates) and is moving with time due to the nucleus\nrotation. Let us define R\u03c9 the rotation matrix for a lapse\n\u2206t, so that we have (\u03b80 , \u03c60 )t+\u2206t = R\u03c9 * (\u03b80 , \u03c60 )t . The jet\ndirection at distance r = r0 + vexp \u2206t in the coma is J r =\nR\u22121\n\u03c9 * J 0 , where vexp is the gas expansion velocity.\nWe assume a Haser-like parent molecule distribution for\nCO.

This model provides populations pu as a function\nof radial distance r, given a H2 O density law with r. For\nsimplicity, we assumed an isotropic H2 O coma, and pu only\ndepending upon r. The collisional CO\u2013H2 O cross-section is\ntaken equal to \u03c3c = 2\u00d710\u221214 cm2 (Biver et al., 1999b), and\nthe H2 O production rate is QH2 O = 1031 s\u22121 (Colom et al.,\n1999). In the simulations presented in Sect. 4, a kinetic temperature T = 120 K is used (see Sect. 2.2 for further discussion). The evolution of the population of the CO J = 2 and\nJ = 1 levels is shown in Fig. 11. The beam size of 20.9\u2032\u2032 for\nCO J(2\u20131) corresponds to r \u223c 10 000 km in the coma. Most\nCO molecules within the field of view are in local thermal\nequilibrium.\nGiven the evolving coma, a full simulation of the observations would require to compute for each one minute\nscan the visibilities corresponding to the current state of\nthe coma and to their uv-coverage. In order to limit the\ncomputer time, we modelled a whole nucleus revolution (P\n= 11.35 h) by 12 snapshots (see Fig. 12). We tested the\nvalidity of the approach by verifing that calculations with\nan increased time sampling (namely 36 snapshots) provide\nsimilar results. Between 2 snapshots i and i + 1, the jet direction changed following (\u03b80 , \u03c60 )i+1 = R\u03c9 (\u03b80 , \u03c60 )i , where\nR\u03c9 is the rotation matrix for a span of P/12. Providing the\ninitial jet longitude at time t corresponding to snapshot i=1\nis fixed, a composite uv-table can be computed with the uvcoverage of the observations.

Jet morphology analysis\nIn this Section, the ON\u2013OFF and interferometric velocity\nshift curves observed for CO J(2\u20131) (Figs 4 and 10), and\nthe time evolution of the visibilities (Fig. 9) will be analysed with the model presented in the previous Section to\nconstrain its free parameters. Because of limited signal-tonoise ratio, it was not possible to make this analysis for\nJ(1\u20130) observations. For the spin axis orientation defined\nby its aspect angle \u03b8\u03c9 and position angle pa\u03c9 , we restricted\nour study to the mean values found in the literature (see\nTable 1): \u03b8\u03c9 = 60 to 90\u25e6 , and pa\u03c9 = 200 to 230\u25e6 . The jet\nwidth \u03a8 was tested from 1\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 , the jet latitude l from\n0\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 North, and fco from 10% to 80%.\n4.1. ON\u2013OFF velocity shift curve\n\nFig. 12.

The\nlatitudes are shown by steps of 10\u25e6 and the arrow shows the\nrotation direction. The symbols represent the series of jet\npositions used to make a composite uv-table for an equatorial jet. Plain (respectively dotted) symbols mean that\nthe jet is on the visible (respectively hidden) side of the\nnucleus.\n\ntwelve composite uv-tables, each of them corresponding to\ndifferent initial jet longitudes spaced by 360\u25e6 /12. The longitude origin is chosen so that the sub-terrestrial point on\nthe nucleus surface is at a longitude of 0\u25e6 . For illustration,\nFig. 12 shows the twelve jet positions for a jet at a longitude of 0\u25e6 at the time of the first snapshot. The model also\ncomputes synthetic ON\u2013OFF spectra for each snapshot.\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 2.2, data shown in Fig. 4 are well fitted\nby a sinusoid with a period P = 11.35 h, an amplitude A =\n0.29 km s\u22121 , and centred on v0 = \u22120.05 km s\u22121 . We can also\ndefine a phase t0 = 11.75\u00b10.12 UT, that corresponds to the\ntime when the velocity shift is equal to v0 on the increasing\nside of the curve. We used these three parameters (A, v0 ,\nt0 ) as criterions for selecting the models that could explain\nthe observations. Note that the position angle pa\u03c9 of the\nspin axis has no influence on the velocity shift.\nThe phase t0 is only ruled by the initial longitude of the\njet. From t0 derived from the observations, the best initial\nlongitude is 300\u25e6 at 3 h 47 UT.\nAt first order, A is governed by fco and \u03a8 : it increases\nwhen fco increases or \u03a8 decreases. This behaviour is easily\nexplained. If fco increases \u2013 all other parameters remaining\nunchanged \u2013 there is more signal coming from the jet falling\ninto the same number of spectral channels. Then, the velocity shift increases, so does the amplitude of the velocity\nshift curve. In a similar way, when \u03a8 decreases \u2013 keeping\nfco constant \u2013 an equal amount of signal coming from the\njet is falling into a larger number of spectral channels. This\nresults in reducing the velocity shift and also A. This is illustrated in Figs 13 and 14, which show the evolution of A\nwith fco and \u03a8. Moreover, A is not sensitive to the aspect\nangle \u03b8\u03c9 , except for small \u03a8's, as observed in Figs 13 and\n14. Furthermore, we note that the jet latitude l has little\ninfluence upon the amplitude, within the limits where we\ntested it (|l| < 45\u25e6 ) (Fig. 15). To conclude, the observed\n\n\f12\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nTable 3.

An equatorial jet always\nproduces a curve centred on 0 km s\u22121 , whatever \u03b8\u03c9 . For\n\u03b8\u03c9 < 90\u25e6 , a jet with a northern (resp. southern) latitude\nproduces a curve centred on a negative (resp. positive) velocity. Again, this behaviour is understood. With \u03b8\u03c9 < 90\u25e6 ,\nthe North pole is pointing towards the Earth (see Fig. 12).\nAs a result, a northern jet is more often directed towards the\nEarth than a southern one. Opposite effects are obtained\nfor \u03b8\u03c9 > 90\u25e6 , while \u03b8\u03c9 = 90\u25e6 (rotation axis in the plane of\n\n\u03b8\u03c9\n70\u25e6\n80\u25e6\n80\u25e6\n80\u25e6\n\nl\n10\u25e6\n10\u25e6\n20\u25e6\n30\u25e6\n\n\u03a8\n19.9\u25e6\n11.9\u25e6\n18.3\u25e6\n33.0\u25e6\n\nfco\n35.7%\n33.6%\n35.5%\n47.8%\n\nthe sky) always produces a curve centred on 0 km s\u22121 , irrespective of the sign of the latitude. The more the rotation\naxis is far from the plane of the sky, the more the velocity shift curve is shifted. Furthermore, the velocity shift\ncurve is all the more shifted as \u03a8 is small and fco is large\n(Fig. 15). This study leads us to the conclusion that, here\nagain, many combinations (fco ,\u03a8,l) are able to reproduce\nthe observed v0 . However, it shows that only a northern jet\nwill be able to fit the observations.\nFor a given (\u03b8\u03c9 ,l,fco ) parameter set, it is possible to\nfind the jet width \u03a8 that is able to reproduce the amplitude A = 0.29 km s\u22121 . Figure 16 shows in dotted curves the\nlocus of the couples (fco ,\u03a8) that reproduce the right amplitude A for several fixed (\u03b8\u03c9 ,l) values. The same method is\nemployed to determine the couples (fco ,\u03a8) that reproduce\nthe right velocity centre v0 = \u22120.05 km s\u22121 (dashed curves\nin Fig. 16). For each set (\u03b8\u03c9 ,l), the intersection of the dotted and the dashed curves gives the only couple (fco ,\u03a8)\nthat reproduces A and v0 . We made these computations\nfor latitudes between 0\u25e6 and 45\u25e6 , and for \u03b8\u03c9 = 70\u25e6 and\n80\u25e6 . Computations for \u03b8\u03c9 = 90\u25e6 were useless because they\nprovide v0 = 0 km s\u22121 .\nThe combinations (\u03b8\u03c9 ,fco ,\u03a8,l) selected by this study\nare summarized in Table 3. We note that the jet strength\nfco is typically between 35 and 50%. The jet is located on\nthe northern hemisphere at a latitude between 0\u25e6 and 45\u25e6\n(both excluded) for \u03b8\u03c9 = 80\u25e6 , and between 0\u25e6 and 20\u25e6 (both\nexcluded) for \u03b8\u03c9 = 70\u25e6 .\nThe velocity shift curve obtained for parameter set (3)\nis shown in Fig. 10, together with the observed curve. We\nnote the almost perfect match between model and observations. The corresponding synthetic line profiles are shown\nin Fig. 17. At any time, the jet contributes to both blue\nand red channels, with varying relative contributions, due\nto its spiral shape.\n4.2. Interferometric velocity shift curves\nIn this Section, we study the velocity shift curves observed\nfor the individual baselines. Figure 10 shows model results with the parameter set (3) (\u03b8\u03c9 = 80\u25e6 , pa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6,\n\u03a8 = 18.3\u25e6 , l = 20\u25e6 and fco = 35.5%; Table 3). Other parameter sets of Table 3 give similar curves. Modelled curves are\nperiodic functions, with a period equal to P . They mimic\nsinusoidal curves, though significant deviations from a sinusoid are observed. This is because line shifts measured on\nV(u, v) spectra are (u, v) dependent: stronger jet contrast\nappears in specific regions due to spatial filtering. Then,\ndue to the combination of Earth and jet rotation, regions\nwith more or less jet contrast are sampled by the individual\nbaselines. Simulations show that these curves evolve toward\na true sinusoid when the jet width \u03a8 is increasing (fco kept\nconstant), due to smaller jet contrast. These curves change\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\n13\n\nFig. 16. Couples (fco ,\u03a8) that reproduce the amplitude A = 0.29 \u00b1 0.03 km s\u22121 (dotted curves) and the mean velocity\nv0 = -0.05 \u00b1 0.01 km s\u22121 (dashed curves) for several couples of (\u03b8\u03c9 ,l). The intersections of the curves give, for each (\u03b8\u03c9 ,l)\ncombination, the only couple (fco ,\u03a8) that reproduces A and v0 .\nwhen varying the jet parameters in the same way than does\nthe ON\u2013OFF curve. Changing the spin axis parameters by\n\u00b1 10\u25e6 does not affect much the curves.\nThe modelled velocity shift curves for the different\nbaselines are not in phase, with t0 (defining the phase,\nsee Sect 4.1) increasing with decreasing baseline length\n(Fig. 18). We expect a phase offset due to the spiral shape\nof the jet. Indeed, with respect to long baselines, short baselines probe molecules in more distant regions of the spiral.\nHence, they sample molecules released in average at earlier times. In addition, baselines of different length (even\nif they are parallel) record the maximum signal from the\njet at different times due to the curvature of the jet. This\ncan be understood from Fig. 19, which plots the amplitude\nof the visibility as a function of the orientation and length\nof the baselines for a simple geometry (rotation axis along\nthe line of sight and equatorial jet) and at a given time.\nThe combination of both effects introduces a phase offset\nin the velocity shift curves. The delay between two baselines in the velocity shift curves represents the elapsed time\nbetween the jet detection by one baseline and its detection\nby the following one. Note that, given the large curvature\nof the spiral (molecules travel r \u223c 104 km when the nucleus\nrotates by 90\u25e6 ), only its innermost part contributes significantly to the detected signal. The dashed curve in Fig. 18\nshows the evolution of t0 with uv-radius, assuming that t0\nvaries linearly with \u03c3/vexp : it follows approximately the t0\ncurve computed by the model (plain curve).\nThe comparison between modelled and observed phases\nt0 and amplitudes A shows that there is relatively good\nagreement for some baselines and strong discrepancies for\nothers (Fig. 18). Good agreement for both t0 and A is obtained for baselines 3\u20134 and 2\u20134. Phase t0 is well reproduced for baseline 1\u20133 (but not the amplitude). Strong discrepancy (by 3 h for t0 and a factor of almost 2 in A) is\nobserved for baselines 1\u20134, 1\u20135 and possibly 4\u20135 (errorbars\nare large for this baseline). It is striking to note that good\nagreement is obtained for baselines with their field of view\naligned along the spin vector, while discrepancies are observed for baselines with their field of view perpendicular\nto the spin vector. Clearly our model is too simple to reproduce all observational characteristics. We did not find any\nsimple explanation for these discrepancies. Velocity accel-\n\neration inside the jet changes t0 evolution with baseline in\nthe opposite way: it would result in a flatter increase with\ndecreasing baseline length than obtained with a constant\nvelocity. The presence of other CO evolving structures in\nHale-Bopp coma is the likely explanation (Sect. 4.5).\n4.3. Visibilities\nFigure 9 shows the time evolution of the visibilities V\u0304\nplotted as a function of the uv-radius \u03c3 (as defined in\nSect. 2.3, V\u0304 refers to the amplitude of the visibilities integrated over velocity). A least-squares fit to these data\ngives V\u0304(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3 \u22121.18\u00b10.02 , to be compared to the \u03c3 \u22121 variation expected for a parent molecule distribution and an optically thin line (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan & Boissier, 2009). This\ntrend can be explained by optical depth effects being more\nimportant for long baselines probing the inner coma.\nModulations are observed around this fit: they trace\nvariations of the brightness distribution sampled by the\nindividual baselines as the baselines and jet are rotating.\nThese modulations are characterized by their shape and\ntheir amplitude. The shape depends essentially upon the\nrotation axis position angle pa\u03c9 and the jet latitude l. For\nexample, a high-latitude jet would result in strong modulations for baselines 3\u20134, 2\u20134 and 2\u20133, and no modulations for\nbaselines 1\u20133 and 1\u20134 which scan regions along the equator\n(Fig. 20). The reverse is expected for a high-latitude jet\nand pa\u03c9 at 90\u25e6 from the nominal pa\u03c9 of Hale-Bopp rotation axis. Qualitatively, the observed modulations exclude a\nhigh-latitude jet, as well as they exclude a rotation axis position angle much different than the pa\u03c9 derived from visible\nobservations. This confirms the conclusion obtained from\nthe time evolution of the photometric centres (Sect. 2.3),\nsensitive to both the amplitude and phase of the visibilities.\nWe compared the observed visibilities to those computed with the model with jet parameters (2), (3) and (4)\ngiven in Table 3 (those with \u03b8\u03c9 = 80\u25e6 and pa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6 ). The\nlowest \u03c72 (reduced \u03c72N \u2212n = 5.1 for N = 150 data points\nand n = 5 free parameters) was obtained for the set of parameters (3) with \u03a8 = 18.3\u25e6 , l = 20\u25e6 and fco = 35.5%.\nSimulations with parameters (2) (respectively (4)) show\nlarger (resp. lower) modulations than observed, and \u03c72 val-\n\n\f14\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nFig. 17.

The total spectrum (jet+isotropic contribution) is shown by thick lines. The grey spectrum shows the\ncontribution of the CO jet.\n\nues 60% (resp. 22%) larger than with parameters (3). Using\njet parameters (3), we also made simulations with \u03b8\u03c9 = 60\nand 70\u25e6 and pa\u03c9 = 200, 220 and 230\u25e6 . The \u03c72 was minimized for pa\u03c9 = 220\u25e6 (\u03c72N \u2212n = 3.8), while \u03b8\u03c9 has no significant influence on the visibilities. However, pa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6\nexplains better the visibilities of the 3\u20134 baseline. Figure\n21 shows the modelled visibilities with parameters (3) and\npa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6. Looking to the shape of the modulations, there\nis an overall agreement between model and observations\nthough, admittedly, the agreement is not perfect. A plot\nof observed versus modelled visibilities shows that the best\nagreement is for baselines 3\u20134, 1\u20135, 1\u20134, 1\u20133 and 4\u20135. The\nlargest discrepancies are for baselines 2\u20134, 1\u20132, and 2\u20135. For\nmost baselines, jet detection (traced by amplitude increase)\noccurs \u223c 1 h earlier in the simulation than in the observations. In contrast, in the velocity shift curves, the simulated\njet is late with respect to the observed jet for most baselines. This again shows that our model is too simple to\nexplain satisfactorily the data.\nThe visibilities obtained when optical depth effects are\nneglected show the same temporal behaviour (Fig. 22).\n\nFig. 18. Phase t0 (bottom) and amplitude A (top) of the\nvelocity shift curves as a function of uv-radius. Dots with\nerror bars are the data. The range of uv radius spanned\nby the baselines is shown with horizontal lines in the bottom figure. The plain curve shows model calculations with\n\u03b8\u03c9 = 80\u25e6 , pa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6 , \u03a8 = 18.3\u25e6 , l = 20\u25e6 and fco = 35.5%.\nThe dotted curve in the bottom figure assumes that the\nelapsed time between jet detection by baseline at uv-radius\n\u03c31 and jet detection by baseline at \u03c32 (or in ON\u2013OFF spectrum at \u03c32 = 15 m) is equal to (\u03c32 -\u03c31 )/2vexp , with vexp =\n1.05 km s\u22121 . The reference time is t0 measured on the ON\u2013\nOFF velocity shift curve. The orientation of the baselines\nfringes during the course of the observations is shown at\nthe bottom, together with the spin axis direction in the\n(RA, Dec) plane: e.g., the field of view of baseline 3\u20134 has\nits long dimension (reflecting the primary beam of the antenna) along the spin vector of the comet, and its short\ndimension (related to the baseline length) perpendicular to\nit. The Sun direction in the (RA, Dec) plane is also indicated.\nHowever, as expected, modulations are more contrasted in\nthe optically thin case.\nThe visibilities obtained with jet parameters (3) vary\naccording to V\u0304(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3 \u22121.24 , which is consistent, in first\norder, with the observed variation (\u221d \u03c3 \u22121.18\u00b10.02 ).\n4.4.

The rotation axis (P = 11.35 h) is along\nthe line of sight (\u03b8\u03c9 = 0\u25e6 ). The jet is equatorial, has an\naperture \u03a8 = 30\u25e6 , and its direction at the nucleus surface\nis at a position angle of 60\u25e6 in the plane of the sky (i.e.,\n\u03b80 = 30\u25e6 ). Other parameters are QCO = 1 \u00d7 1030 s\u22121 , fCO\n= 1, with assumed optically thin conditions.\n\n15\n\nFig. 21.

CO 230 GHz modelled visibilities for a highlatitude jet.\n\ncoma is relatively well reproduced by the model. Some differences may be due to the presence of other CO coma\nfeatures, as suggested by noticeable discrepancies at 8h50\u2013\n9h50 UT. The time evolution of the photometric centre\nmeasured on the simulated data (jet parameters (3) with\npa\u03c9 = 210\u25e6) is shown in Fig. 24. When the position of\nthe photometric centre is refered to the mean photometric\ncentre for the observing period, and is therefore directly\ncomparable to the measurements, there is good agreement\nin the overall evolution. As could be expected, the relative\n(modelled\u2212observed) positions generally differ, with discrepancies reaching \u223c0.3\u2032\u2032 for 4h30\u20135h30 and 7h20\u20138h20\ndata (maps 1 and 3). However, the good overall agreement\nconfirms a posteriori that the observed time evolution of\nthe CO 230 GHz peak brightness position is related to the\nCO rotating coma.\n\nSynthetic 230 GHz spectral maps directly comparable\nto the observations (Fig. 6) were computed. Some observed\nbasic features are well reproduced, as the very peaked and\nstrong emission in the blue channels at high velocity and the\nelongated coma in East-West direction for the blue channels\nat velocities close to zero. However, the asymmetry of the\nspatial distribution observed in the red channels is not obtained in the model. As a matter of fact, the model, which\nparameters were constrained from the large scale ON\u2013OFF\nobservations, predicts that the inner parts of the jet probed\nduring the course of the interferometric observations were\nmost of the time projecting Earthward (i.e., with negative\nDoppler velocities). The discrepancies between modelled\nand observed spectral visibilities discussed previously are\nobserved directly on the spectral maps.\n4.5. Evidence for a second moving structure\nThe inability of our one-jet model to reproduce satisfactorily the interferometric data is due to the presence of a\nsecond moving CO structure, possibly produced during an\noutburst.\nThis moving structure is that seen North-West from the\nnucleus at positive velocities in the time averaged channel\n\n\f16\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nFig. 25. Time evolution of the CO 230 GHz photometric centre for individual velocity channels at v = \u20131.0, \u20130.5, 0,\n+0.5, +1.0 km s\u22121 . The spectral data were smoothed to a spectral resolution of 0.5 km s\u22121 . The time intervals labelled 1\nto 6 are given in Sect.4.5 . Note that they do not correspond to those used for Figs. 23 and 24. The top figure shows the\nmeasurements, while the model (set of parameters (3) in Table 3) is shown in the bottom figure. In order to illustrate\nhow the photometric centres are affected by the main jet, we have connected points (coloured in blue) indicative of the\nmotion of the CO main jet. The so-called \"red jet\" is shown by red symbols.\nmaps (Fig. 6). This structure, which is moving away from\nthe observer, is oriented along the fringes of baselines 1\u2013\n4, 1\u20135, 3\u20135 and 4\u20135, i.e., along those for which a strong\ndiscrepancy in the time variation of the velocity shift is observed. This structure is essentially detected by these baselines : hence, the velocity shift measured for these baselines\nis smaller than expected (Fig. 10).\nIn order to study the time evolution of this stucture,\nthe spectral data were smoothed to a spectral resolution of\n0.5 km s\u22121 , with velocity channels centred at \u20131.0, \u20130.5, 0,\n+0.5, +1.0 km s\u22121 with respect to the comet rest velocity.\nFive consecutive time intervals (#1, #2, #4, #5, #6) of\n\u223c 50 min to 1h30 long, were considered. The time intervals correspond to characteristic line shapes for the spectrum recorded by baseline 3\u20134 (Fig. 3): #1 (4h30\u20135h48 UT)\nsymmetric shape ; #2 ( 5h48\u20137h07 UT) and #4 (7h07\u20139h08\nUT) asymmetric shape with strong blueshift ; #5 (9h08\u2013\n10h00 UT) symmetric shape; #6 (10h00 UT\u201311h28) asymmetric shape with high redshift. A sixth period, labelled\n#3, merging intervals #2 and #4, was also considered.\nThe 5\u00d76 extracted data sets were analysed in the\nFourier plane assuming that the brightness distribution is\na 2-D Gaussian, with its intensity, width and offset with\nrespect to the line-integrated, time-averaged centre Cm as\nfree parameters. Figure 25 shows the observed time evolution of the offset (RA(t), Dec(t)) for each channel. The\nsame plot is shown using model (3) as input.\nFor a non-rotating nucleus, the motion of a cloud of gas\nreleased during a short time interval from a nuclear source\n\nwould be seen by a straight line in the (RA, Dec) quadrant\nand the velocity channel where its velocity vector projects.\nFor a rotating nucleus, a permanent nuclear source near the\nequator will produce an expanding jet that will appear successively in the different channels as the nucleus rotates. In\nthe case of comet Hale-Bopp, if the equatorial jet projects\nNorth-West in (RA, Dec) at positive velocities channels\n(V+ ) at a given time, then it will successively project NorthWest in negative velocity channels (V\u2212 ), South-East/V\u2212 ,\nSouth-East/V+ . As shown in Fig. 25, there is a satisfactory\nagreement between the model and the observations for the\nchannels centred on \u20131.0, \u20130.5 and 0 km/s. We have tentatively connected the points corresponding to the motion of\nthe CO main jet. At time #1, the jet is Westward in the\nv = 0 channel, at time #4 it is moving Eastward in the v\n= \u20130.5 km s\u22121 channel, at time #5 Eastward in the v = 0\nchannel, and at time #6 Eastward in the v = +0.5 km s\u22121\nchannel.\nThe motion of the red structure is clearly apparent on\nthe channels at v = +0.5 and +1 km s\u22121 . The direction of\nthe motion suggests that it originates from a low latitude\nregion at the nucleus surface. The longitude of this source\nis estimated to be within 90\u2013150\u25e6 westward from the source\nof the main jet. The weak contribution of the red structure\nto some baselines can be explained by spatial filtering, implying a compact structure. The CO 230 GHz flux density\nin channels v = +0.5 and +1 km s\u22121 is four times smaller\nthan in channel v = \u20130.5 km s\u22121 at the time the CO main\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\n17\n\nFig. 24.

This may explain why the red source\ndoes not contribute much to the ON\u2013OFF spectra.\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Model assumptions\nThe observations presented in this paper were interpreted\nwith a simple geometric model of a CO rotating coma.\nBesides the assumed conical shape of the jet at ejection\n(see the discussion below), several other simplifying assumptions were made to limit the number of free model\nparameters. The outflow velocity was fixed and taken to be\nconstant throughout the coma, whereas some acceleration\nis expected by gas dynamics models (Combi et al., 1999).\nDay-to-night asymmetries in velocity for the CO background gas were not taken into account either, though they\nare clearly present. Indeed, the velocity cutoff and width of\nthe blue wing of the CO velocity profiles are 10% higher\nthan the corresponding values for the red wings (Fig. 3),\nwhich suggests higher velocities towards the sunlit side of\nthe nucleus given the Earth-comet-Sun geometry. In addition, we assumed that CO molecules inside the jet expand\n\nat the same velocity than those in the background. We believe that including slight variations in the flow velocity\nfield would not change the main conclusions of this paper,\nthough the characteristics of the jet could somewhat differ.\nFor example, including this day-to-night asymmetry in velocity would shift the jet towards lower latitudes. Higher velocities inside the jet would require a proportionally higher\njet contribution to the total CO production fco to fit the\nON\u2013OFF data. We also did not consider possible temperature variations in the coma which have direct effects on CO\nexcitation. A kinetic temperature higher in the jet than\nin the background gas would have resulted in a higher inferred fco . However, a 10 K difference in temperature would\nchange fco by less than 10%.\n5.2. CO jet\nOur observations, interpreted with the help of a simple\nmodel, suggest the presence of a spiralling \"jet\" of CO,\noriginating from the nucleus. The rotation of this jet is\nconsistent with the rotation period and axis direction derived from most optical studies. The jet originates from\na low-latitude (\u2248 20\u25e6 ) region of the nucleus, and comprises a significant amount of the total CO production (\u223c\n40%) in a \u223c20\u201330\u25e6 wide aperture. This is the first evidence of a CO spiralling coma around a comet nucleus.\nCO ro-vibrational line emissions observed in comet HaleBopp from January to May 1997 show strong East/West\n\n\f18\n\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\nasymmetries, with the position of the maximum brightness\nmoving with time from up to \u223c2\u2032\u2032 West to \u223c2\u2032\u2032 East of the\ncontinuum peak (DiSanti et al., 2001; Brooke et al., 2003).\nThis is likely caused by the rotating CO structure observed\nin the radio (Brooke et al., 2003) and shows that this CO\nstructure was not a transient phenomenon related to some\noutburst.\nOur model, which includes a single jet, appears to be\ntoo simple to interpret all observation characteristics. Other\n\"jets\" are present, in particular another moving structure\nhas been identified at positive velocities in the interferometric data. Its full characterization is difficult from our data\nand beyond the scope of this paper. The CO main jet is certainly more complex than a simple conical spiralling structure. Gas structures created by inhomogeneities in gas production at the nucleus surface will unescapably be modified\nduring their outflow by the surrounding collisional environment (the collisional sphere in Hale-bopp coma exceeded\n105 km near perihelion, Combi et al., 1999).\nGas dynamics models investigating the behavior of expanding dusty gas jets have been developed (see the review\nof Crifo et al., 2005). One or several active sources releasing water were considered, the rest of the nucleus being\nassumed to be weakly active. They show that, due to lateral expansion driven by pressure gradients, jets broaden\nwith increasing distance to nucleus and interact with each\nother, to become eventually almost indiscernible in the\nouter coma. In addition, if there is solar modulation of the\nsurface gas flux, the jet morphology will change its appearance as the nucleus rotates. So far, these calculations may\nnot be relevant to the CO jet seen in comet Hale-Bopp.\nFirst of all, it is very likely that CO diffuses from subsurface\nlayers. Our observations suggest that, in first order, there\nis no significant day-to-night asymmetry in the amount of\nCO gas released by the active source. Second, if the active\nsource responsible for the CO jet does not produce similar\nstrong enhancement in water production, pressure smoothing will not be acting much and jet broadening may rather\nresult from molecular diffusion. In this case, it is possible\nthat a nearly invariant CO density pattern co-rotates with\nthe nucleus and remains relatively well preserved at large\nscales in the coma. However, it can be anticipated that the\njet development will be still influenced by the surrounding\nenvironment.\nA good illustration is the following. Rodionov & Crifo\n(2005) performed time-dependent 3-D gas dynamics calculations simulating rotationally-induced gas coma structures. They used an arbitrarily Halley-like aspherical nucleus, scaled to Hale-Bopp nucleus size and homogeneous\nin composition. CO was assumed to diffuse uniformly from\nbelow the surface, while H2 O sublimates according to solar illumination. The computed CO coma is asymmetric.\nThe model produces faint H2 O and CO spiralling structures resulting from weak shocks induced by the surface\ntopography. In other words, the CO outflow is largely influenced by the general and detailed properties of the flow.\nThe analysis of the CO Plateau de Bure observations using\ntime-dependent (multi-fluid) gas dynamics calculations was\nperformed by Boissier et al. (2005, 2009). They show that\nthe observed time variations cannot be explained by the\nabove mentioned shock structures and is due to a strong\ninhomogeneity in CO production from the nucleus surface\nor sub-surface. It is possible to hypothesize lengthly about\nthe meaning of this CO overproduction. It can traduce in-\n\nhomogeneities in CO content inside the nucleus but also local variations in mantle thickness, or in some properties of\nthe nucleus material (e.g., dust/ice matrix structure, thermal conductivity). We leave this discussion to experts and\nencourage them to perform numerical simulations (see the\nreview of Prialnik et al., 2005).\n5.3. Comparison with other studies\nTwo questions arise:\n1) Is the CO jet we observed related (correlated) to jets\nobserved for other molecules?\n2) Is the CO jet we observed related (correlated) to\nobserved dust jets?\nIn their interferometric observations of several molecular species (HCN, HNC, DCN, HDO) with the OVRO array,\nBlake et al. (1999) observed that the molecular emissions\npeak at positions offset by a few arcsec from the continuum emission of the comet, and attributed these offsets\nto molecular jets. We do not observe such large offsets for\nCO when averaging the data over 70% of the rotation period. However, offsets reaching 1\u20131.5\u2032\u2032 were observed for\nother molecules observed at the PdBI, interpreted to be the\ngaseous signatures of the high latitude dust jet observed in\nthe visible (Boissier et al., 2007). The strong CO jet has no\nstrong H2 S, CS, SO and HCN counterparts though weak rotational modulations in the line shapes of their radio emission are observed for some of them (Boissier et al., 2007).\nLederer & Campins (2002) and Lederer et al. (2009)\nobserved spiralling jets of OH, CN and C2 . Several (up to\nfive) active areas were necessary to reproduce their observations from their Monte Carlo simulation. The strongest\njets are coming from low-latitude regions (\u201322\u25e6 to +20\u25e6 ).\nOne of them could thus be associated with our CO jet. One\nlow-latitude southern area is responsible for one-half of the\nOH coming from jet-source, but has a large opening angle\n(120\u25e6 ). So it is likely not related to the CO jet. Spatial\nprofiles of H2 O obtained from long-slit observations of infrared water lines only show small East-West asymmetries\n(Dello Russo et al., 2000). In summary, there is no strong\nevidence for a strong H2 O jet associated to the CO jet.\nWoodney et al. (2002) mapped HCN in comet HaleBopp with the BIMA array. Their observations, which\nspanned over several days, were binned and averaged according to the phase of the comet rotation, in order to avoid\nsmearing due to rotation. They found a jet morphology,\npossibly correlated with CN imaged in the visible. However,\nthere is apparently no correlation of HCN with dust jets.\nThe presence of a high-latitude HCN jet is however suggested from the PdBI data (Boissier et al., 2007).\nDust jets also appear to be uncorrelated with our\nCO jet. Indeed, from visible imaging at the time\nof the PdBI observations, Jorda et al. (1999) observed\na high latitude (64\u25e6 ) dust jet. In the analysis of\nVasundhara & Chakraborty (1999), strong dust jets are\npresent from latitudes +65\u25e6 and \u201365\u25e6, in addition to weaker\njets from low latitudes (see also Schleicher et al., 2004).\nIn February\u2013May 1997, the high-latitude northern jet produced repetitive sunward shells instead of a full spiral\n(Fig. 26), indicating that the source of this dust jet shut\noff during night time in contrast to the CO jet.\nIn addition to the CO main jet, we have identified a\nsecond moving structure in red channels that we believe\noriginates from a low latitude source. Interestingly, on 12.14\n\n\fBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.: CO in Hale-Bopp (October 26, 2018)\n\n19\n\nare sensitive to the gas distribution along the line of sight,\nwhereas the other techniques are rather sensitive to the distribution on the plane of the sky. They also probe different\ngas species. Radio observations and other techniques are\ntherefore complementary.\nRadio interferometric imaging is a powerful tool for astrometry. Our observations show that, in addition, rotating comas can be detected from the motion of the centroid\nof molecular maps. This opens new perspectives because\npossibly useful constraints on the rotation properties of\ncometary nuclei will be obtained from such measurements.\nThe analysis of our interferometric data was hampered\nby to the limited instantaneous uv-coverage of the Plateau\nde Bure interferometer. The Atacama Large Millimeter and\nsubmillimeter Array (ALMA), with its 50 antennas, will be\nable to obtain images of molecular and continuum emissions\nwith a short sampling time, high sensitivity and high angular resolution. It will provide a 3-D dynamical picture of\ninner cometary gaseous atmospheres, simultaneous images\nof the dust coma, and spatial information on the gas temperature (Biver, 2005; Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan, 2008). Important\nbreakthroughs concerning nucleus and coma processes can\nbe expected.\nAcknowledgements.

In contrast with standard imaging techniques,\nradio observations are sensitive to radial velocities, i.e. they\n\nReferences\nAltenhoff, W.
