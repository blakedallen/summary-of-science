Most of\nthese measurements were made with single-aperture or longslit spectrographs, resulting in samples of typically a few\nH II regions per galaxy or single spectra of large samples\nlike the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000) or\nother large surveys. The advent of multi-object and integral\nfield spectrometers with large fields of view now offers us the\nopportunity to undertake a new generation of emission-line\nsurveys, based on samples of scores to hundreds of individual\nH II regions within a single galaxy and full 2-dimensional\n(2D) coverage of the disks.\nIn this paper, we describe the PPAK IFS Nearby\nGalaxies Survey: PINGS, a project designed to construct\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations collected at the Centro Astron\u00f3mico Hispano Alem\u00e1n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the\nMax-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (CSIC).\n\u2020 E-mail: frosales@ast.cam.ac.uk\nc 2010 RAS\n\n2D spectroscopic mosaics of a representative sample of\nnearby spiral galaxies, using the unique instrumental capabilities of the Postdam Multi Aperture Spectrograph,\nPMAS (Roth et al. 2005) in the PPAK mode (Verheijen et al. 2004; Kelz et al. 2006; Kelz & Roth 2006)\nat the Centro Astron\u00f3mico Hispano Alem\u00e1n (CAHA) at\nCalar Alto, Spain. \"The PMAS fibre PAcK (PPAK) is currently one of the world's widest integral field units with a\nfield-of-view (FOV) of 74 \u00d7 65 arcsec that provides a semicontiguous regular sampling of extended astronomical objects\" (Kelz, http://tinyurl.com/ppak-aip). This project\nrepresents one of the first attempts to obtain 2D spectra of\nthe whole surface of a galaxy in the nearby universe. The observations consist of integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic\nmosaics for 17 nearby galaxies (D < 100 Mpc) with a projected optical angular size of less than 10 arcmin. The spectroscopic mosaicking comprises more than 50000 spectra in\nthe optical wavelength range. The data set will be supplemented with broad band and narrow band imaging for those\nobjects without publicly available images.\nThe primary scientific objectives of PINGS are to use\nthe 2D IFS observations to study the small and intermediate\nscale variation in the line emission and stellar continuum\n\n\f2\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nby means of pixel-resolved maps across the disks of nearby\ngalaxies. These spectral maps will allow us to test, confirm,\nand extend the previous body of results from small-sample\nstudies, while at the same time open up a new frontier of\nstudying the two-dimensional metallicity structure of disks\nand the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity. Furthermore, the\nlarge body of data arising from these studies will also allow\nus to test and strengthen the diagnostic methods that are\nused to measure H II region abundances in galaxies.\nPrevious works have used multi-object instruments to\nobtain simultaneous spectra of H II regions in a disk galaxy\n(e.g. Roy & Walsh 1988; Kennicutt & Garnett 1996; Moustakas & Kennicutt 2006a), or narrow-band imaging of specific fields to obtain information of star forming regions and\nthe ionized gas (e.g. Scowen et al. 1996). One important attempt is represented by the SAURON project (Bacon et al.\n2001), which is based on a panoramic lenslet array spectrograph with a relatively large FOV of 33 \u00d7 41 arcsec2 .\nSAURON was specifically designed to study the kinematics and stellar populations of a sample of nearby elliptical\nand lenticular galaxies. The application of SAURON to spiral galaxies was restricted to the study of spiral bulges. A\nrecent effort by Rosolowsky & Simon (2008) plans to obtain\nspectroscopy for \u223c 1000 H II regions through the M 33 Metallicity Project, using multi-slit observations. On the other\nhand, Blanc et al. (2009) obtained IFS observations of the\ncentral region of M 51 (\u223c 1.7 arcmin2 ), using the VIRUS-P\ninstrument. However, in spite of the obvious advantages of\nthe IFS technique in tackling known scientific problems and\nin opening up new lines of research, 2D spectroscopy is a\nmethod that has been used relatively infrequently to study\nlarge angular-size nearby objects. Recently, PPAK was used\nsuccessfully to map the Orion nebula, obtaining the chemical composition through strong line ratios (S\u00e1nchez et al.\n2007b). Likewise, PMAS in the lens-array configuration was\nused to map the spatial distribution of the physical properties of the dwarf H II galaxy II Zw 70 (Kehrig et al. 2008),\nalthough covering just a small FOV (\u223c 32 arcsec).\nDespite these previous efforts toward IFS of nearby\ngalaxies, the application to obtain complete 2D information\nin galaxies is a novel technique. Reasons for the lack of studies in this area include small wavelength coverage, fibre-optic\ncalibration problems, but mainly the limited FOV of the instruments available worldwide. Most of these IFUs have a\nFOV of the order of arcsec, preventing a good coverage of\nthe target galaxies on the sky in a reasonable time, even\nwith a mosaicking technique. Furthermore, in some cases the\nspectral coverage is not appropriate to measure important\ndiagnostic emission-lines used in chemical abundance studies. Moreover, the complex data reduction and visualisation\nimposes a further obstacle to more ambitious projects based\non 2D spectroscopy. To our knowledge there has been no\nattempt to obtain point-by-point spectra over a large wavelength range of the whole surface of a galaxy covering all\nH II regions within it. Similarly to SAURON for early-type\ngalaxies, PINGS will provide the most detailed knowledge of\nstar formation and gas chemistry across a late-type galaxy.\nThis information is also relevant for interpreting the integrated colours and spectra of high redshift sources. In that\nrespect, PINGS represents a leap in the study of the chemical abundances and the global properties of galaxies.\nThe objectives of this paper are: 1) to provide the back-\n\nground information of the PINGS survey; including a detailed description of the observations, all the data reduction\ntechniques implemented (some of them novel in the treatment of IFS data), and all the uncertainties involved in this\nprocess; 2) to offer a general description of the procedures\ninvolved in IFS observations of this kind; and 3) to present\nthe PINGS data products and the archival value of this survey. The paper is organised as follows. In \u00a7 2 we describe\nthe core scientific objectives of the PINGS project and we\ndiscuss some of the many applications of the data set. In\n\u00a7 3 we describe the properties of the galaxy sample selected,\nwhile in \u00a7 4 we explain the observational strategy and the\nPINGS observations themselves. In \u00a7 5 we present the description of the complex data reduction involved in this IFS\nsurvey, while in \u00a7 6 we describe the sources and magnitudes\nof the errors and uncertainties in the data sample. In \u00a7 7, we\nsummarise the basic properties of the data, showing a few\nscience case examples extracted from the data set, including\nthe integrated properties, emission line maps and a comparison of line intensity ratios with previously published studies\nfor some galaxies. Finally, in \u00a7 8 we give a summary of the\narticle.\n\n2\n\nSCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\n\nThe study of chemical abundances in galaxies has been significantly benefited from the vast amount of data collected\nin recent years, either at the neighborhood of the Sun, or\nat high redshifts, especially on large scale surveys such as\nthe SDSS or the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (Colless et al.\n2001). Most studies derived from these observations have\nfocused on linking the properties of high redshift galaxies\nwith nearby objects, as an attempt to understand the principles of the formation and chemical evolution of the galaxies\n(e.g. see Pettini 2006). Historically, the metal content of low\nredshift galaxies has been determined through the nebular\nemission of individual H II regions at discrete spatial positions, these measurements provide hints on the chemical\nevolution, stellar nucleosynthesis and star formation histories of spiral galaxies. The chemical evolution is dictated by\na complex array of parameters, including the local initial\ncomposition, the distribution of molecular and neutral gas,\nstar formation history (SFH), gas infall and outflows, radial\ntransport and mixing of gas within disks, stellar yields, and\nthe initial mass function (IMF). Although it is difficult to\ndisentangle the effects of the various contributors, measurements of current elemental abundances constrain the possible evolutionary histories of the existing stars and galaxies,\nand thus the importance of the accurate determination of\nthe chemical composition among different galaxy types.\nDifferent studies have shown a complex link between the\nchemical abundances of galaxies and their physical properties. Such studies are only able to accurately measure the\nfirst two moments of the abundance distribution \u2013the mean\nmetal abundances of disks and their radial gradients\u2013 and on\ncharacterising the relations between these abundance properties and the physical properties of the parent galaxies, for\nexample galactic luminosity, stellar and dynamical mass, circular velocity, surface brightness, colors, mass-to-light ratios, Hubble type, gas fraction of the disk, etc. These studies have revealed a number of important scaling laws and\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nsystematic patterns including luminosity-metallicity, massmetallicity, and surface brightness vs. metallicity relations\n(e.g. Skillman et al. 1989; Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1992;\nZaritsky et al. 1994; Tremonti et al. 2004), effective yield\nvs. luminosity and circular velocity relations (e.g. Garnett\n2002), abundance gradients and the effective radius of disks\n(e.g. Diaz 1989), and systematic differences in the gas-phase\nabundance gradients between normal and barred spirals (e.g.\nZaritsky et al. 1994; Martin & Roy 1994). However, these\nstudies have been limited by the number of objects sampled, the number of H II regions observed and the coverage\nof these regions within the galaxy surface.\nIn order to obtain a deeper insight of the mechanisms\nthat rule the chemical evolution of galaxies, we require the\ncombination of high quality multi-wavelength data and wide\nfield optical spectroscopy in order to increase significantly\nthe number of H II regions sampled in any given galaxy.\nThe PINGS project was conceived to tackle the problem\nof the 2-dimensional coverage of the whole galaxy surface.\nThe imaging spectroscopy technique applied in PINGS provides a powerful tool for studying the distribution of physical\nproperties in nearby well-resolved galaxies. PINGS was specially designed to obtain complete maps of the emission-line\nabundances, stellar populations, and reddening using an IFS\nmosaicking imaging, which takes advantage of what is currently one of the world's widest FOV IFU. With this novel\nspectroscopic technique, the data can be used to derive: 1)\noxygen abundance distributions based on a suite of strongline diagnostics incorporating absorption-corrected H\u03b1, H\u03b2,\n[O II], [O III], [N II], and [S II] line ratios; 2) local nebular reddening estimates based on the Balmer decrement; 3) measurements of ionization structure in H II regions and diffuse ionized gas using the well-known and most updated\nforbidden-line diagnostics in the oxygen and nitrogen lines;\n4) rough fits to the stellar age mix from the stellar spectra.\nThe resulting spectral maps and ancillary data will be\nused to address a number of important astrophysical issues\nregarding both the gas-phase and the stellar populations in\ngalaxies. For example, one application will be able to test\nwhether the metal abundance distributions in disks are axisymmetric. This is usually taken for granted in chemical\nevolution models, but one might expect strong deviations\nfrom symmetry in strongly lopsided, interacting, or barred\ngalaxies, which are subject to large scale gas flows. Another\nimportant goal is to place strong limits on the dispersion\nin metal abundance locally in disks; there is evidence for a\nlarge dispersion in some objects such as NGC 925 or M 33\n(Rosolowsky & Simon 2008), but it is not clear from those\ndata whether the dispersion is due to non-axisymmetric\nabundance variations, systematic errors in the abundance\nmeasurements, or a real local dispersion. Yet another by\nproduct of our analysis will be point by point reddening\nmaps of the galaxies, which can be combined with UV,\nH\u03b1, and infrared maps to derive robust, extinction-corrected\nmaps of the SFR.\nPINGS can also provide a very detailed knowledge of\nthe role played by star formation in the cosmic life of galaxies. All the important scaling laws previously mentioned tell\nus that, once born, stars change the ionization state, the\nkinematics and chemistry of the interstellar medium and,\nthus, change the initial conditions of the next episode of star\nformation. Substantially, star formation is a loop mechanism\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n3\n\nwhich drives the luminosity, mass and chemical evolution of\neach galaxy (leaving aside external agents like interactions\nand mergers). The details of such a complex mechanism are\nstill not well established observationally and not well developed theoretically, and limit our understanding of galaxy\nevolution from the early universe to present day. In combination with ancillary data, the flux maps computed from\nthe PINGS data will be used to study both the most recent\nstar formation activity of the targets and the older stellar\npopulations. We will be able to identify the gas and stellar\nfeatures responsible for the observed spectra, to derive the\ndependence of the local star formation rate on the local surface brightness, a key recipe for modelling galaxy evolution\nand the environmental dependence of star formation. These\ndata will also provide an important check for interpreting\nthe integrated broad-band colours and spectra of high redshift sources.\n\n3\n\nSAMPLE DESCRIPTION\n\nIn order to achieve the scientific goals described above, we\nincorporated a diverse population of galaxies, adopting a\nphysically based approach to defining the PINGS sample.\nWe decided to observe a set of local spiral galaxies which\nwere representative of different galaxy types. However, the\nsize and precise nature of the sample were heavily influenced by a set of technical considerations, the principal limiting factor being the FOV of the PPAK unit. We wanted to\nobserve relatively nearby galaxies to maximise the physical\nlinear resolution using the mosaicking technique. However,\nwe also had to take into account the limitations imposed by\nthe amount of non-secure observing time and meteorological\nconditions for the granted runs. Therefore, the sample size\nwas dictated by a balance between achieving a representative range of galaxies properties and practical limitations in\nobserving time.\nWhen constructing the sample, we also took into account a range of other galaxy properties, such as inclination\n(with preference to face-on galaxies), surface brightness, bar\nstructure, spiral arm structure, and environment (i.e. isolated, interacting and clustered). We favoured galaxies with\nhigh surface brightness and active star formation so that\nwe could have a good distribution of H II regions across the\ngalaxies surface. Galaxies with bars and/or non-typical spiral morphology were also preferred. The final selection of\ngalaxies also took into account practical factors such as optimal equatorial right ascension and declination for the location of Calar Alto observatory, and the observable time\nper night for a given object above a certain airmass (due to\nproblems of differential atmospheric refraction).\nThe PINGS sample consists of 17 galaxies within a maximum distance of 100 Mpc; the average distance of the sample is 28 Mpc (for H0 = 73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). The final sample includes normal, lopsided, interacting and barred spirals\nwith a good range of galactic properties and SF environments with multi-wavelength public data. A good fraction\nof the sample belongs to the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS, Kennicutt et al. 2003), which ensures a\nrich set of ancillary observations in the UV, infrared, H I and\nradio.\nThe sample objects were given a different observing pri-\n\n\f4\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nFigure 1.

Table 1 gives a complete listing of the PINGS sample with\nsome of their relevant properties. The first priority was assigned to medium-size targets such as NGC 1058, NGC 1637,\nNGC 3310, NGC 4625 and NGC 5474 which are bright, faceon spirals of very different morphological type, with many\nsources of ancillary data and could be covered with relatively\nfew IFU pointings. The second priority was given to smaller\ngalaxies which fit perfectly in terms of size and acquisition\ntime for the periods during the night when the first priority\nobjects were not observable (due to a high airmass or bad\nweather conditions) and/or in the case their mosaicking was\ncompleted.\n\nNGC 628 (Messier 74) is a special object among the selected galaxies and the most interesting one of the sample.\nNGC 628 is a close, bright, grand-design spiral galaxy which\nhas been extensively studied. With a projected optical size\nof 10.5 \u00d7 9.5 arcmin, it is the most extended object of the\nsample. Although it could be considered too large to be fully\nobserved in a realistic time, we attempted the observation of\nthis galaxy considering that the spectroscopic mosaicking of\nNGC 628 represents the real 2-dimensional scientific spirit\nof the PINGS project (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2009, hereafter Paper II). Such a large galaxy would offer us the possibility to\nassess the body of results from the rest of the small galaxies\nin the sample and would allow us to study the 2D metallicity structure of the disk and second order properties of\nthe abundance distribution. The observations of this galaxy\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nspanned a period of three-years. Hitherto, NGC 628 represents the largest area ever covered by an IFU, as described\nbriefly in the next section and in detail in Paper II. A special\npriority was also given to NGC 3184, galaxy which falls between the medium first-priority and large size galaxies. The\nobservations for this object spanned for 2 years, obtaining\nan almost complete mosaicking (see Figure 1), making this\ngalaxy the 2nd largest object of the sample.\nFigure 1 shows Digital Sky Survey1 images for a selection of galaxies listed in Table 1. The mosaicking of the\nlargest objects in the sample, NGC 628 and NGC 3184, consist of 34 and 16 individual IFU pointings respectively, covering almost completely the spiral arms of these two bright\ngrand-design galaxies. The outlying pointings of NGC 1058\nand the mosaicking configurations of NGC 3310, NGC 6643\nand NGC 7771 are explained in the next section.\nIn summary, the PINGS sample was selected in a careful\nway to find a trade-off between the size of the galaxies, their\nmorphological types, their physical properties and the practical limitations imposed by the instrument and the amount\nof observing time. The result is a comprehensive sample of\ngalaxies with a good range of galactic properties and available multi-wavelength ancillary data, in order to maximise\nboth the original science goals of the project and the possible\narchival value of the survey.\n\n4\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nObservations for the PINGS galaxies were carried out at\nthe 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto observatory with the\nPostdam Multi Aperture Spectrograph, PMAS (Roth et al.\n2005) in the PPAK mode (Verheijen et al. 2004; Kelz et al.\n2006), i.e. \"a retrofitted bare fibre bundle IFU which expands the FOV of PMAS to a hexagonal area with a footprint of 74 \u00d7 65 arcsec, with a filling factor of 65% due to\ngaps in between the fibres\". The PPAK unit features a central hexagonal bundle with 331 densely packed optical fibres\nto sample an astronomical object at 2.7 arcsec per fibre.\nThe sky background is sampled by 36 additional fibres distributed in 6 mini-IFU bundles of 6 fibres each, in a circular\ndistribution at \u223c 90 arcsec of the centre and at the edges of\nthe central hexagon. The sky-fibres are distributed among\nthe science ones in the pseudo-slit, in order to have a good\ncharacterisation of the sky. Additionally, 15 fibres can be\nilluminated directly by internal lamps to calibrate the instrument.\nAll sample galaxies were observed using the same telescope and instrument set-up. We used the V300 grating,\ncovering a wavelength between 3700 \u2013 7100 \u00c5 with a resolution of \u223c 10 \u00c5 FWHM, corresponding to \u223c 600 km s\u22121 .\nWith this set-up we cover all the optical strong emission\nlines used in typical abundance diagnostic methods (S\u00e1nchez\net al. 2007b). For the particular setup used in the PINGS\n1\n\nThe Digitized Sky Survey was produced at the Space Telescope\nScience Institute under U.S. Government grant NAG W-2166.\nThe images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain\nand the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were processed into\nthe present compressed digital form with the permission of these\ninstitutions.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n5\n\nsurvey there was no need to use a order separating filter. The\nmain reason being that the efficiency of the instrument +\ntelescope system (mostly the grating reflectivity and the fibre transmission), drops dramatically at wavelengths shorter\nthan \u223c 3600 \u00c5, where the transmission is 1/40000 of the one\nat the peak intensity for the V300 grating (\u223c 5400 \u00c5) and\n1/10000 of the value at redder wavelengths covered by our\nsurvey (\u223c 6500 \u00c5). At bluer wavelengths the efficiency is\neven lower. Therefore, the system by itself blocks any possible 2nd order contamination up to \u223c 7200 \u00c5, and only at\nlarger wavelengths it is required an order separation filter\n(Kelz et al. 2006). The exposure times were calculated from\nprevious experience with the instrument in order to obtain\nspectroscopy with S/N > 20 in the continuum and S/N >\n50 in the H\u03b1 emission line for the brightest H II regions with\nthe given grating.\nDifferent observing strategies were implemented depending on the size and priority of the targets. For those objects with relatively small angular size, single PPAK pointings would not sample the surface of the galaxy with enough\nspatial resolution, due to the incomplete filling factor of the\nfibre bundle. In this case, a dithering procedure was applied\n(S\u00e1nchez et al. 2007a). For each individual position in dithering mode, the first exposure was recorded and then, two\nconsecutive exposures with the same acquisition time were\nrecorded, but with small offsets of \u2206(RA, Dec) = (1.56, 0.78)\nand (1.56, \u20130.78) arcsec with respect to the first exposure.\nThe advantage of this method is that all gaps of the original\nexposure are covered, and every single point of the dithered\nfield is spectroscopically sampled within the resolution. The\npitfalls are that the exposure time and the amount of data\nto be processed is triple a normal frame, preventing the possibility of applying this method to large mosaics. We used a\nmean acquisition time per PPAK field in dithering mode (including set-up + integration time) of 2 \u00d7 600 sec. per dithering position for a total of 60 min. exposure; and 3 \u00d7 600 sec.\nfor non-dithered frames.\nThe observations extended over a period of three-years\nwith a total of 19 observing nights distributed during different observing runs and seasons. For all the objects in\nthe sample, the first exposure was centered in a given geometrical position which, depending on the morphology or\na particular mosaicking pattern, may or may not coincide\nwith the bright bulge of the galaxy. Consecutive pointings\nfollowed in general a hexagonal pattern, adjusting the mosaic pointings to the shape of the PPAK science bundle as\nshown in Figure 1. Due to the shape of the PPAK bundle\nand by construction of the mosaics, 11 spectra of each pointing corresponding to one edge of the hexagon, overlap with\nthe same number of spectra from the previous pointing. This\npattern was selected to maximise the covered area, but to\nallow enough overlapping to match the different exposures\ntaken under variable atmospheric conditions. Exceptions are\nNGC 2976, NGC 3310, NGC 6643 and NGC 7770 in which\nthe mosaics were constructed to optimise the galaxy surface\ncoverage as explained below.\n4.1\n\nNGC 628\n\nNGC 628 (or M 74) is an extensively studied isolated granddesign Sc spiral galaxy at a distance of 9.3 Mpc in the constellation of Pisces.

We observed this galaxy with a standard mosaic configuration consisting of one central position and one concentric ring. All pointings were observed in dithering mode.\nObservations were carried out in two different periods; 4\npositions were observed during August 9th and 10th 2008,\nwhile 2 additional pointings were observed on the 27th April\n2009. Given the distorted morphology of this galaxy, the\ncentral position of the mosaic does not coincide with the\nbright bulge; a 30 arcsec offset in declination was performed\ntowards the south, so that the area covered by the IFU mosaicking includes most of the optical disk of the galaxy in\na symmetric way. The area covered by all the observed positions is approximately 6 arcmin2 . The spectroscopic data\nfor this galaxy totals 5958 individual spectra.\n4.9\n\nNGC 6643\n\nNGC 6643 is a SAc galaxy in Draco, with a projected size\nof 3.8 \u00d7 1.9 arcmin in the B-band, at a distance of 20 Mpc.\nA tailored mosaic pattern for this galaxy was constructed in\norder to cover most of its optical area. Three pointings cover\nthe surface of NGC 6643 with a central position centered on\nthe bulge and two offsets of (37, 34) and (\u201335, \u201334) arcsec\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n9\n\nin (RA,Dec) in north-east and south-west directions respectively (see Figure 1). Observations were performed on June\n2nd 2008 for the first 2 positions and on August 10th 2008\nfor the 3rd position, all of them in dithering mode. At the\ntime of the first observing run, we were able to observe the\nsupernova 2008bo, a SN type Ib located at 31\" north and 15\"\nwest of the nucleus of NGC 6643. This galaxy has a complete\nspectroscopic mosaic covering an area of approximately 2.8\narcmin2 . The data consists of 2979 individual spectra. However, due to a technical problem with the instrument set-up,\npositions 1 and 2 do not cover the usual wavelength range,\nbut are shifted towards the red by approximately 100 \u00c5.\n4.10\n\nNGC 6701\n\nNGC 6701 is a small barred spiral in Draco with an angular size of 1.5 \u00d7 1.3 arcmin, at a distance of 57 Mpc. This\ngalaxy was considered to be an isolated galaxy, but studies\nof NGC 6701 have discovered morphological and kinematical features that are consequence of an interaction, most\nprobably with a companion at 73 kpc in projected distance\n(Marquez et al. 1996). The observation of NGC 6701 was\ncarried out on August 9th 2008 with one single pointing in\ndithering mode covering the optical radius of the galaxy (see\nFigure 1). The spectroscopic data of this galaxy contains 993\nindividual spectra.\n4.11\n\nNGC 7770 and NGC 7771\n\nThe main target for this mosaic was the galaxy NGC 7771,\na barred spiral in Pegasus with an optical B-band size of\n2.5 \u00d7 1.0 arcmin at a distance of 59 Mpc. This galaxy is\npart of an interactive system containing mainly the face-on\nspiral NGC 7769 and the faint lenticular NGC 7770 (Nordgren et al. 1997). The central part of NGC 7771 contains\na massive circumnuclear starburst which was probably triggered by the interaction with the other members of the group\n(Smith et al. 1999, and references therein). Due to the projected size of this galaxy, the mosaic pattern was constructed\nwith three IFU positions. The central position of the mosaic has an offset of (\u201315, \u201315) arcsec in (RA, Dec) from the\ngeometrical centre of the galaxy (see Figure 1). Two additional positions were observed with offsets of (37, 33) and\n(\u201337, \u201333) arcsec. A second member of the interacting group,\nNGC 7770, a small S0 galaxy with an optical size 0.8 \u00d7 0.7\narcmin was observed within the field of the mosaic pattern.\nObservations of all 3 positions were performed on October\n30th 2008. The spectroscopic data for this galaxy contains\n993 individual spectra.\n4.12\n\nStephan's Quintet\n\nThe Stephan's Quintet is one of the most famous and wellstudied group of galaxies, consisting of NGC 7317, 7318A,\n7318B, 7319 and 7320 in Pegasus. The distance to this compact group of galaxies has been in debate due to the presence of the brightest member, NGC 7320, which exhibits a\nsmaller redshift than the others, suggesting that is a foreground object lying along the line of sight of the other four\ninteracting galaxies. Although some controversy prevailed\n(Balkowski et al. 1974; Kent 1981), recent observations by\n\n\f10\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nHST show that individual stars, clusters, and nebulae are\nclearly seen in NGC 7320 and not in any of the other galaxies (Gallagher et al. 2001; Appleton et al. 2006, and references therein). Four individual pointings in non-dithering\nmode were observed on August 10th 2008, three of which\nwere centered at the bright bulges of NGC 7317, 7319 and\n7320, while the last pointing was centered in configuration\nto cover NGC 7318A and NGC 7318B (see Figure 1). The\nspectroscopic data for all pointings of the Stephan's Quintet contains 1324 individual spectra.\n\n5\n\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nThe reduction of IFS observations possesses an intrinsic\ncomplexity given the nature of the data and the vast amount\nof information recorded in a single observation. This complexity is increased if one considers creating an IFU spectroscopic mosaic of a given object for which the observations\nwere performed not only on different nights, but even in\ndifferent years, with dissimilar atmospheric conditions, and\nslightly differing instrument configurations.\nIn this section we give an overview of the IFS data reduction process for all the observations of the PINGS sample. In general, the reduction process for the all pointings\nfollows the standard steps for fibre-based integral field spectroscopy. However, the construction of the mosaics out of\nthe individual pointings requires further and more complicated reduction steps than for a single, standard IFU observation. These extra steps arise due to the special mosaicking pattern for some of the objects, the differences in the\natmospheric transparence and extinction, slight geometrical\nmisalignments, sky-level variations, differential atmospheric\nrefraction, etc. A complete explanation of the complex data\nprocessing for the creation of the PINGS mosaics sample\nis beyond the scope of this paper, but the reader will find\na detailed description of the IFS data reducing in S\u00e1nchez\n2006 (hereafter San06) and additional information on the\nmosaicking technique for the PINGS sample in the description of the PPAK-IFS survey of NGC 628 (Paper II).\nFollowing San06, all the data reduction steps can be\nsummarised as follows: a) Pre-reduction. b) Identification of\nthe location of the spectra on the detector. c) Extraction\nof each individual spectrum. d) Distortion correction of the\nextracted spectra. e) Application of wavelength solution. f)\nFibre-to-fibre transmission correction. g) Flux calibration.\nh) Allocation of the spectra to the sky position. i) Cube\nand/or dithered reconstruction (if any).\nThe raw data extracted from a PINGS observation consists of a collection of spectra, stored as 2D frames, aligned\nalong the dispersion axis. The pre-reduction of the IFS data\nconsists of all the corrections applied to the CCD that are\ncommon to the reduction of any CCD-based data, i.e. bias\nsubtraction, flat fielding (in the case of PINGS, using twilight sky exposures), combinations of different exposures\nof the same pointing and cosmic ray rejection. The prereduction processing was performed using standard IRAF2\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with\nthe National Science Foundation.\n\npackages for CCD pre-reduction steps while the main reduction was performed using the R3D software for fibre-fed\nand integral-field spectroscopy data (San06) in combination\nwith the E3D visualization software (S\u00e1nchez 2004).\nOn a raw data frame, each spectrum is spread over a\ncertain number of pixels along the cross-dispersion axis. The\nspectra are generally not perfectly aligned along the dispersion axis due to the configuration of the instrument, the\noptical distortions, the instrument focus and the mechanical\nflexures. Therefore, in order to find the location of each spectrum at each wavelength along the CCD and to extract its\ncorresponding flux, we made use of continuum illuminated\nexposures taken at each pointing corresponding to a different\norientation of the telescope. Each spectrum was extracted\nfrom the science frames by co-adding the flux within an aperture of 5 pixels assuming a cut across the cross-dispersion\naxis found by iterative Gaussian fits (see subsection 6.5 for\na detailed description of this reduction step). Since the misalignments of the fibres with the pseudo-slit also affect the\nwavelength solution, we require lamp exposures obtained at\neach observed position to find a wavelength solution for each\nindividual spectrum. Wavelength calibration was performed\nusing HeHgCd+ThAr arc lamps obtained through the instrument calibration fibres. Differences in the fibre-to-fibre\ntransmission throughput were corrected by creating a master fibreflat from twilight skyflat exposures taken in every\nrun.\nThe reduced IFS data can be stored using different data\nformats, all of which should allow to store the spectral information in association with the 2D position on the sky.\nTwo data formats are widely used in the IFS community:\ndatacubes (3-dimensional images) and Row-Staked-Spectra\n(RSS) files. Datacubes are only valid to store reduced data\nfrom instruments that sample the sky-plane in a regular-grid\nor for interpolated data. In this case the data are stored in a\n3-dimensional FITS image, with two spatial dimensions and\none corresponding to the dispersion axis. RSS format is a\n2D FITS image where the X and Y axes contain the spectral and spatial information respectively, regardless of their\nposition in the sky. This format requires an additional file\n(either a FITS or ASCII table), where the position of the\ndifferent spatial elements on the sky is stored. RSS is widely\nused by IFUs with a discontinuous sampling of the sky, as\nit is the case for PPAK. We chose to store the PINGS data\nin the RSS format, with corresponding position tables.\nOnce the spectra are extracted, corrected for distortions, wavelength calibrated, and corrected for differences in\ntransmission fibre-to-fibre, they must be sky-subtracted and\nflux-calibrated. One of the most difficult steps in the data\nreduction is the correct subtraction of the night sky emission spectrum. In long-slit spectroscopy the sky is sampled\nin different regions of the slit and a median sky spectrum\nis obtained by spectral averaging or interpolation. This is\npossible due to the size of the long-slit compared with the\nsize of the astronomical objects of interest. However, in IFS\nthe techniques vary depending on the geometry of the observed object and on the variation of the sky level for a\ngiven observation. By construction, many of the positions\nof the PINGS mosaics (specially those in the galaxy centre)\nwould fill the entire FOV of the IFU, and none of the spaxc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nels3 would be completely free of galaxy \"contamination\". In\nthis case, we obtained supplementary sky exposures (immediately after the science frames) applying large offsets from\nthe observed positions and between different exposures, we\nthen used these \"sky-frames\" to perform a direct sky subtraction of the reduced spectra. On the other hand, if the\nFOV is not entirely filled by the object, it is possible to select\nthose spaxels (i.e. the sky-fibres in the case of PPAK) with\nspectra free of contamination from objects, average them\nand subtract the resulting sky-spectrum from the science\nspectra. We used this technique for observations in the last\nring of a mosaic or at the edges of the optical surface of the\ngalaxies, where the sky-fibres bundles did actually sample\nthe sky emission.\nOnce the sky emission has been subtracted, we need\nto flux calibrate the observed frames. Absolute spectrophotometry with fibre-fed spectrographs is rather complex; as\nin slit-spectroscopy, where slit losses impose severe limitations, IFU spectrographs can suffer important light losses\ndue to the geometry of the fibre-arrays. The flux calibration requires the observation of spectrophotometric standard\nstars during the night. Given that the PPAK IFU bundle\ndoes not cover the entire FOV due to gaps among the fibres, the observation of calibration standard stars is prone\nto flux losses, especially when the standards are not completely well centered in a single IFU spaxel. However we\ndeveloped a method which takes into account the flux losses\ndue to the gaps in the fibre-bundle, the pointing misalignments and PSF of the observed standard stars, as well as\ncorrections for minor cross-talk effects, airmass, local optical extinction and additional information provided by broad\nand narrow-band imaging photometry in order to obtain the\nmost accurate possible spectrophotometric flux-calibration\nwithin the limits imposed by the instrumentation.\nA total of six standard stars from the Oke spectrophotometric candles (Oke 1990) were observed for the purpose\nof flux calibration during the observing runs. These frames\nwere reduced following the basic procedure described above.\nTo counteract the loss of flux, the observed spectrum of a\nstandard star was obtained by adding up the spectra from\nconsecutive concentric spaxel rings centered on the fibre\nwhere most of the standard's flux is found, until a convergence limit was found (see Figure 4). We then determined a\nnight sensitivity curve as a function of wavelength by comparing the observed flux with the calibrated spectrophotometric standard spectrum considering the filling factor of the\nfibre-bundle. We applied this function to the science frames\nconsidering corrections for the airmass and the optical extinction due to the atmosphere as a function of wavelength\nto get relative flux-calibrated spectra for each position.\nFigure 6 shows the shape and relative magnitude of nine\nsensitivity curves obtained during the three years of observations. The difference in the vertical scale reflects the variation of the spectrophotometric transmission during different\nnights and observing runs (the flux calibration obtained by\napplying these sensitivity curves is just a relative one, an\nabsolute calibration is obtained by re-scaling by a factor derived after the comparison with the broad-band imaging by\napplying the method described below). However, the differ-\n\n3\n\nDefinition of IFS discrete spatial elements\n\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n11\n\nFigure 4. Effect of standard star flux loss due to bad seeing and\nmisalignments. On the top panel, the standard star BD+25d4655\nwas observed during good atmospheric conditions and was well\ncentred on the central fibre of the PPAK bundle. The figure contains 37 spectra corresponding to the 36 concentric fibres plus the\ncentral one. Most of the flux falls in the central fibres (red colour\nspectra in the online version), while very small residuals are seen\nin the rest of them (green-blue colour spectra). The bottom panel\nshows the spectra of the same star observed during turbulent atmospheric conditions and when the star was not well centred in\nthe fibre bundle. In this case the flux is spread over a large number of concentric fibres and the individual contribution of each of\nthem is important for the total observed flux.\n\nences on the shape from one sensitivity curve to another as\na function of wavelength, reflect the intrinsic dispersion of\nthe flux calibration. The bottom panel of Figure 6 shows\nthe variation of the sensitivity curves as a function of wavelength after a grey shift with respect to an arbitrary spline\nfitting normalised at the wavelength of H\u03b2 (4861 \u00c5). This\nnormalisation wavelength was chosen as most spectroscopic\nstudies normalise the observed emission line intensities to\nthe flux in H\u03b2. The maximum variation from the blue end\nof the spectrum compared to the red one is of the order of\n\u223c 0.15 mag, corresponding to a maximum calibration error\nof \u223c 15% due solely to the intrinsic dispersion in the relative flux calibration. However, the actual RMS is less than\n0.1 mag, corresponding to a typical error in the relative flux\ncalibration of less than 10%.\nFor those galaxies with suitable multi-band photometric data available in the literature (e.g. NGC 628, NGC 3184,\nNGC 4625, NGC 5474), we used the first-order calibration of\neither the central pointing of a mosaic or the position with\nthe highest S/N and best sky-subtraction to perform an additional correction to the absolute flux calibration by comparing the convolved spectra observed in this field (taking\ninto account fibre apertures and filters' response functions)\nto the corresponding flux measured by B, V , R broad-band\nand H\u03b1 narrow-band imaging photometry for the same position. This procedure ensures a very precise flux calibra-\n\n\f12\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nFigure 5. Observed standard stars on the 9th December 2007.\nThe top panel figure shows a comparison of the night flux calibration applied to the observed stars (in colour in the online\nversion) and the corresponding calibrated fluxes. The panel below show the residuals in magnitudes as a function of wavelength\nfor each star. The points with relatively large deviations are due\nto strong sky emission lines and cosmetic defects of the CCD.\n\ntion and sky extinction correction for this master pointing.\nTo our knowledge, no other IFS observations have ever attempted to get such (instrument-limited) spectrophotometry accuracy. All galaxies belonging to the SINGS sample\nwere corrected by this method using their ancillary data as\ndescribed in more detail in Paper II.\nAfter reducing each individual pointing with a firstorder flux calibration and with the help of the absolute fluxcalibrated master pointing, we built a single RSS file for the\nwhole mosaic following an iterative procedure. The process\nstarts in the master pointing chosen for a specific mosaic,\ni.e. the pointing that has the best possible flux calibration\nand sky extinction correction, with the best signal-to-noise\nand the most optimal observing conditions regardless of the\ngeometric position of the pointing in the mosaic. Taking this\nmaster pointing as a reference, the mosaic is constructed by\nadding consecutive pointings following the particular mosaic geometry. During this process, the new added pointing\nis re-scaled by using the average ratio of the brightest emission lines found in the overlapping spectra (which is then\nreplaced by the average between the previous pointing and\nthe new re-scaled spectra). In most cases the scale factor is\nfound to be between 0.7 and 1.3 with respect to the master\npointing.\nHowever, this ratio is wavelength dependent (specially\nin the cases of variable photometric conditions between the\nobservations). Therefore as a second-order correction, we fitted the variations found between the previous pointing and\nthe new re-scaled overlapping spectra to a low order polynomial function and divided all the spectra in the new pointing\nby the resulting wavelength dependent scale. This correction\nhas little effect on the data when the observations were per-\n\nFigure 6. Variation of the spectrophotometric transmission as\na function of wavelength.

However, we accounted variations\nafter all the possible corrections of the order of 10-15% in\nthe extreme cases when the observations were carried out\nat different epochs (e.g. NGC 628, NGC 3184). This level of\nerror is what we expect from observations performed during\ndifferent nights and observing runs, reflecting the variation\nof the spectrophotometric transmission from night to night\n(see Figure 6). The procedure was repeated for each mosaic\nuntil the last pointing is included (except for the Stephan's\nQuintet, where not actual overlapping occurs), ending with\na final set of individual spectra and their corresponding position tables. This process ensures a homogenous flux calibration and sky extinction correction for the entire data\nset.\n\n6\n\nERRORS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE\nDATA SAMPLE\n\nDuring the process of data reduction and basic analysis, we\nhave identified several possible sources of errors and uncertainties in the PINGS data set. Each of them contribute\nin a different way and magnitude to the overall error budget associated with the observations. These are in order of\nimportance: 1) sky subtraction, 2) flux calibration, 3) differential atmospheric refraction (DAR), 4) cross-talk, and 5)\nsecond order spectra. In this section we describe the nature\nof each of these sources of errors, the tests performed in order to understand their effects on the accuracy of the data,\nand the techniques applied to minimise them.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\n6.1\n\nSky subtraction\n\nAs mentioned before, sky subtraction is one of the most\ndifficult steps in the IFS reduction process and it is particularly complex for the nature of the observing technique of\nPINGS. As described in S\u00e1nchez (2006), a deficient sky subtraction in this sort of data has several consequences: \"the\ncontamination of the sky emission lines along the spectra\nwhich prevents the detection and/or correct measurement\nof relatively weak nebular emission lines (e.g. the weak temperature sensitive [O III] \u03bb4363, which is located in the same\nspectral region as the strong Hg I \u03bb4358 sky line), and also\naffects the shape and intensity of the continuum, which is\nimportant for the analysis of the stellar populations and the\ndetermination of reddening\". In fact, we made use of the\nmosaicking method in order to find the best possible sky\nsubtraction. Due to the shape of the PPAK bundle and by\nconstruction of the mosaics in the standard mosaic configuration, 11 spectra of a given pointing (corresponding to one\nedge of the hexagon) overlap with the same number of spectra from the previous pointing (see NGC 628 or NGC 3184\nin Figure 2). This allows the comparison of the same observed regions at different times and with different atmospheric conditions.\nFor a non-standard configuration the number of overlapping fibres is larger (e.g. NGC 3310). These overlapping\nspectra can be compared and used to correct for the sky\nemission of the adjacent frame. However, prior to performing the sky subtraction it is required to visually check that\nno residual of the galaxy is kept in the derived spectrum.\nThis can be the case if the transmission changed substantially during the observation of the adjacent frames. These\ntechniques proved to result in good sky subtraction in most\ncases. On the other hand, when we were forced to obtain\nsupplementary large-angle offset sky-exposures for the inner pointings in the mosaics that were completely filled by\nthe target, we found that when the sky exposure is taken\nwithin a few minutes of the science exposure it produces a\ngood subtraction. For those cases in which the atmospheric\nconditions changed drastically and/or the sky subtraction\nappeared to be poor, we combined different sky frames with\ndifferent weights to derive a better result.\nOne way of assessing the goodness of the sky subtraction is to check for sky residuals in the subtracted spectra.\nThe galaxy mosaic more prone to be affected by residuals\nin the sky subtraction is NGC 628, which as explained in\nsection 4, was observed during six nights along four observing runs. Therefore we would expect that the spectroscopic\nmosaic of this galaxy would show the most extreme effects\ndue to the sky subtraction to be found in the PINGS sample, given all the variations in transparency and photometric\nconditions of the night-sky along the three years of observations.\nIn order to obtain a quantitative assessment of the quality of the sky subtraction, we performed two different data\nreductions of the spectroscopic mosaic of NGC 628. In the\nfirst reduction, the sky subtraction was performed directly\nwith the average spectrum of the sky fibres at each position, without considering the overlapping spectra between\npointings, and not accounting for the object contamination\nin the sky fibres. Therefore, in this first reduction we applied\na \"poor\" sky subtraction. For the second reduction, we apc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n13\n\nplied an individual sky subtraction per mosaic position using\nthe techniques described above, i.e. applying corrections using the overlapping spectra, checking for galaxy residuals in\nthe derived sky spectrum, using the sky exposures obtained\nby large offsets for the most internal regions of the galaxy,\nand combining different sky frames with different weights in\nthose cases when there were important changes in the transmission between pointings observed during the same night.\nWe refer to this reduction as the \"refined\" sky subtraction.\nAirglow is the most important component of the light of\nthe night-sky spectrum at Calar Alto observatory, although\na substantial fraction of the spectral features is due to air\npollution (S\u00e1nchez et al. 2007). The strongest sky line in\nthe Calar Alto night-sky spectrum is the [O I] \u03bb5577 line,\nfollowed by the [O I] \u03bb6300 line, both produced by airglow\nwith a notorious stronger effect near twilight. A deficient\nsky subtraction can be recognised by residual features of\nthe sky lines in the derived spectra, this effect is clearly\nseen in the [O I] \u03bb5577 sky line which is located in a spectral region without any important nebular emission line. In\ngeneral terms, (without considering variations in the transparency of the sky), a residual in emission of this line would\nimply a subtraction of the sky spectrum of slightly lower\nstrength than required, while an absorption feature would\nimply an over-correction.\nIn order to make a comparative analysis of the strength\nof the sky residuals in the two data reductions of NGC 628\ndescribed above, we measured the equivalent width (EW)\nof the residual features centered at the [O I] \u03bb5577 line. For\nnumerical reasons (regions of null continuum), the local continuum in the neighbourhood of the [O I] \u03bb5577 sky line was\nre-scaled to a flux level of 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 in every\nsingle spectrum of both mosaics. EWs with negative sign\ncorrespond to residual emission features, while positive EWs\ncorrespond to absorption features.\nFigure 7 shows the value of the EW residuals for the\n[O I] \u03bb5577 line for both data reductions as a function of the\npointing position in the spectroscopic mosaic. Each position bin contains 331 values corresponding to the number of\nspectra per pointing, a total of 11104 values are shown, corresponding to the 34 positions observed for NGC 628. The\ngreen dots correspond to the poor sky subtraction reduction,\nwhile the blue dots correspond to the refined sky subtraction\n(see the online version of this plot). There is a considerable\namount of scatter of the EW residual value for the poor sky\nsubtraction compared to the refined one. In the first two\npointings of the mosaic (which correspond to central positions of the galaxy), there are strong residuals in emission\nfor the poor reduction, while the residuals have been minimised in the refined one. Figure 7 shows clear evidence of\nthose pointings in which the sky transparency varied by a\nconsiderable amount (positions 4, 5, 11, 12, 23, 24, 28, 29,\n33, 34). In all the pointings, the scatter in the residuals is\nimproved in the refined reduction with respect to the first\none. This effect is more notorious between positions 13 to\n22. The poor sky subtraction yields very strong sky residuals in emission for positions 33 and 34, while in the refined\nreduction these are minimised.\nAt the chosen continuum level used for this exercise,\na (absolute) value of 5 \u00c5 in EW for the [O I] \u03bb5577 residual line in emission corresponds approximately to a flux intensity value of 5 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , while a value of\n\n\f14\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nFigure 7.

The local continuum level was rescaled to the same value in order to make this comparison. The\ngreen dots (in the online version) correspond to a poor sky subtraction, while the blue dots represent the refined reduction as\nexplained in the text. The two horizontal dotted lines mark the\nthreshold EW values of residuals features corresponding to a good\nsky subtraction.\n\n10 \u00c5 corresponds to \u223c 10 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The average flux intensity of the [O I] \u03bb5577 sky line in Calar Alto\nis of the order of 33 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (S\u00e1nchez et al.\n2007). However, from a sample of 500 sky spectra acquired\nduring the three years of observation we measured the intensity of the [O I] \u03bb5577 in the range between 30 and 60\n\u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , with a mean value of 44. Therefore, a\nvalue of 5 \u00c5 in EW for a residual emission feature would correspond to \u223c 8\u201310% of the total emission of the [O I] \u03bb5577\nline. Visual inspection of the spectra with emission residual\nof the order of 5 \u00c5 in EW confirms that this value could\nbe considered as the threshold for a good sky subtraction.\nSpectra with emission or absorption residuals with absolute\nEW values less than 5 \u00c5 could be considered to have a good\nsubtraction, for features above this value the effects of a\ndeficient sky subtraction are evident.\nThe two horizontal dotted lines in Figure 7 indicate the\n\u00b15 EW threshold value for both emission and absorption\nfeatures. These two lines encompass a region for which the\nspectra can be considered with a good sky subtraction. The\npoor sky subtraction (green) shows a lot of scatter and a\nsmall fraction of the spectra falls within these limits. On the\nother hand, for the refined reduction (blue) a total of 9629\nspectra fall within these limits, i.e. 87% of the total mosaic.\nThe number of spectra with sky subtraction problems for\nwhich |EW| > 5 \u00c5 is 1475, i.e 13% of the mosaic, these spectra are found in those pointings with extreme transparency\nvariations as expected.\nFigure 8 shows the histograms of the EW values for both\ndata reductions, the poor sky subtraction in green and the\nrefined reduction in blue colour following Figure 7 (see the\nonline version of this plot). The top panels show the distribution of residual emission values, while the bottom panels\n\nFigure 8. Histograms of the EW residual features shown in\nFigure 7. The top panels shows the distribution of EW values for\nthe emission residuals. The bottom panels shows the EW values\nfor the absorption features. All EW values are shown in logarithmic scale (assuming a positive EW value for the emission residuals). The top histograms in both cases correspond to the poor\nsky subtraction, while the bottom histograms correspond to the\nrefined reduction (green and blue colour histograms in the online\nversion). The \u223c 5 \u00c5 EW threshold value is shown as the vertical\nline in all the histograms, residual values to the right of this line\ncan be considered a deficient sky subtraction as explained in the\ntext.\n\nshow the absorption residual features for the [O I] \u03bb5577.\nThe \u223c 5 \u00c5 EW threshold value is shown as the vertical line\nin the histograms, residual values to the right of this line can\nbe considered a deficient sky subtraction. Visual inspection\nof the spectra shows that, at the continuum level used for\nthis comparison, emission or absorption features with values\nof log(|EW|) 6 0 could be considered negligible and within\nthe statistical noise of the spectra. The residual emission\nhistograms show that the poor sky subtraction produces a\nlarge number of strong residuals with values of |EW| > 5\n\u00c5, even reaching |EW| \u223c 60 \u00c5. The majority of the residual\nvalues in refined sky subtraction are found at log(|EW|) \u223c 0,\ncorresponding to negligible residual values, however there is\na small tail of strong emission residuals for which |EW| > 5\n\u00c5 (\u223c 18% of the total emission residuals). The distribution\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nof EW values of the absorption features for the poor subtraction is approximately centered at the threshold limit, while\nfor the refined reduction, the values are nearly normally distributed with a centre value of log(EW) \u223c 0 with a small\ntail of strong absorption values (\u223c 7%) due most likely to\nan over subtraction of the sky spectrum.\nThe refined sky subtraction was the final adopted one\nfor the spectroscopic mosaic of NGC 628. All the sky subtraction techniques implemented showed that the quality of\nthe derived spectra was improved by a considerable amount\ncompared to a standard sky subtraction. Most of the sky\nresiduals are within the limits of a reasonably good sky\nsubtraction. The spectra with strong features are found for\nthose positions in which the photometric conditions changed\ndrastically during the night or observing run. This residual\nanalysis allows to identify those pointings with strong sky\nvariations and thus, to flag the spectral data for future analysis. The sky subtraction for the rest of the PINGS sample\nwas performed similarly to the refined technique described\nabove. Therefore we applied the best possible sky subtraction to all the spectroscopic mosaics within the limitations\nimposed by the IFS data itself.\n6.2\n\nDetection of the [O III] \u03bb4363 line\n\nThe Hg \u03bb4358 sky line strongly affects any attempt to measure precisely the emission of the faint temperature-sensitive\n[O III] \u03bb4363 line in any object with a low redshift. The fact\nthat the strength of this line decreases with increasing abundance (Bresolin 2006), in combination with typically faint\nH II regions and low spectroscopic resolution limits importantly the detectability of this key diagnostic line.\nIn order to assess the significance of the detection of\nthe [O III] \u03bb4363 given the contamination of the Hg \u03bb4358\nsky line in our data, we performed a simulation of the detectability of the [O III] \u03bb4363 line for a given range of redshifts and line intensity strengths. We simulated a pure emission line spectrum including the H\u03b3 \u03bb4340 and [O III] \u03bb4363\nlines at the same spectral resolution of the PINGS observations; we assumed a normally distributed I(\u03bb4363)/H\u03b3 ratio with a mean value of 0.10 \u00b1 0.05, corresponding to typical values found in previous spectroscopic studies where\nthe [O III] \u03bb4363 line was detected in H II regions within\nthe metallicity range of the PINGS sample (e.g. McCall\net al. 1985); we did not consider higher ratios (\u223c 0.25 \u00b1 0.10)\nwhich are representative of extremely low metallicity objects\n(e.g. Pagel et al. 1992; Izotov & Thuan 2004). We added a\nrandom statistical noise of 0.05 RMS at the continuum level\nconstructed from the observed spectroscopic data. A sample of 540 sky spectra were selected among all the observing runs during the three years of observations (considering\nvery different photometric conditions). A flux calibrated sky\nspectrum was created out of these selected spectra. This sky\nspectrum was added to the previous emission line plus the\nnoise described above to create a simulated \"observed\" spectrum. An average sky spectrum constructed from a random\nsubset of 36 sky spectra (the number of PPAK sky-fibres)\nwas then subtracted from the simulated \"observed\" spectrum to obtain a \"sky-free\" spectrum.\nEmission line intensities were then measured simultaneously for both lines in the simulated \"sky-free\" spectrum using the techniques described in subsection 7.2. These line inc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n15\n\nFigure 9. Detectability of the [O III] \u03bb4363 line as a function of\nredshift and line strength according to the simulation described\nin subsection 6.2. For a given redshift, the [O III] \u03bb4363 can be\nsignificantly detected for flux values above the thick line, which\nmarks the region at which the difference between the observed and\nsimulated line intensity is of the order of 15%. The contamination\neffect of the Hg \u03bb4358 disappears for redshift values larger than\n0.004.\n\ntensities were then compared with the flux of the pure emission lines. For a given redshift, we varied the emission line\nstrengths of the simulated spectrum from high to lower values until the significance of the detection of the [O III] \u03bb4363\nfell drastically. We performed 500 realisations of the emission line intensity measurements for a given redshift and for\na given line strength. Figure 9 shows the results of the simulation, the thick line represents the region at which the difference between the line intensity measured from the simulated\n\"sky-free\" spectrum and the flux from the pure emission line\nis of the order of 15%. According to the simulation, observed\nflux values of the [O III] \u03bb4363 above this line can be significantly detected at a given redshift. For flux values below\nthis region the significance of the detection is negligible as\nit is mostly affected by the statistical noise of the data. The\ncontamination effect of the Hg \u03bb4358 disappears for redshift\nvalues larger than \u223c 0.004, where the detectability of the\n[O III] \u03bb4363 depends on the signal-to-noise of the spectrum\nat low line-intensity levels. Experience with the data has\nproven that the simulation described in this section places\nvery good limits on the detectability and potential measurement of this faint line, although after detection, individual\nand visual inspection of the spectra has to follow in order\nto correctly assess the usefulness of this line.\n\n6.3\n\nFlux calibration\n\nSeveral refinements in the observation technique and standard flux recovery were applied to the pipeline which improved substantially the accuracy of the sensitivity functions\nobtained after every standard candle observation. During\nmost of the observing runs we observed different standard\nstars per night at different airmasses in order to asses the\n\n\f16\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nvariation in transmission and its effect on the relative flux\ncalibration.\nWe generated several sensitivity curves following the\nstandard pipeline procedure in R3D, changing the key parameters that could affect the accuracy of the derived sensitivity function (e.g. order and type of the fitting function,\nextinction, airmass, smoothing, etc.). Furthermore, we made\na comparison of the response curves obtained through R3D\nand the ones obtained using standard long-slit flux calibration routines in IRAF after performing all the appropriate\ncorrections and transformations for the two different kinds\nof data. We even derived whole-run sensitivity curves after the combination of several response curves for a given\nobserving run and applied the derived calibration to the observed standard candles as a proof of self-consistency. In all\ncases, we found very consistent results in the final relative\nflux calibration. As described in section 5, even without a\nre-calibration using broad-band imaging, the spectral shape\nand features are reproduced within the expected errors for\nan IFS observation (\u223c 20% in the absolute sense) along the\nwhole spectral range, with a small increase in the blue region\n(\u03bb < 3800 \u00c5) due in part to the degradation of the CCD\nimage quality and instrumental low sensitivity towards the\nblue (\u223c 2 \u2013 5%, telescope/atmosphere excluded) in this spectral region (Roth, priv. comm.).\nFor those galaxies with available multi-band photometric data, small differences in the transmission curves of the\nfilters and astrometric errors of the built mosaics bring some\nuncertainties in the derived flux ratios that contribute to the\noverall standard deviation when applying the photometric\nre-calibration described before. The errors in the first case\nare difficult to estimate, however the latter ones were estimated by simulating different mosaic patterns by applying\nnormally distributed random offsets of the simulated fibreapertures with mean values of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.3 arcsec on\nthe broad-band images and then comparing the extracted\nspectrophotometry. From the results of these simulations\nand considering that the IFS mosaics were re-centered using the information directly from the aperture photometry,\nwe expect that the location of the fibres lies within 0.5 arcsec, and therefore the error due to the uncertainty in the\nastrometry would be of the order of 10%. Based on these\nresults, we estimate a spectrophotometry accuracy better\nthan \u223c 0.2 mag, down to a flux limit corresponding to a surface brightness of \u223c 22 mag/arcsec2 (see Paper II) when we\napply the re-calibration derived by the flux ratio analysis.\nIn the following section we compare our data with previously published spectrophotometrically calibrated data. The\nspectral shape, the spectral features and emission line intensities match remarkably well, even for those objects for\nwhich no re-calibration was performed (see Figure 11). As\nstated above, to our knowledge no other IFU observation\nhas ever implemented such corrections in order to obtain an\ninstrumental-limited spectrophotometry accuracy as in this\nwork.\n6.4\n\nDifferential Atmospheric Refraction\n\nAn important systematic effect in any spectroscopic observation is due to the refraction induced by the atmosphere,\nwhich tends to alter the apparent position of the sources\nobserved at different wavelengths. By definition, there is no\n\nrefraction when the telescope is pointed at the zenith, but for\nlarger zenith angles the effect becomes increasingly significant. For IFU observations, this has the consequence that,\nwhen comparing for example the intensities at two different\nwavelengths (e.g the emission line ratio of a source), one will\nactually compare different regions, given that different wavelengths are shifted relative to each other on the surface of\nthe IFU. In theory, one is capable of performing a correction\nof DAR for a given pointing without requiring knowledge of\nthe original orientation of the instrument and without the\nneed of a compensator, as explained by Arribas et al. (1999).\nThe correction of DAR is important for the proper combination of different IFS exposures of the same object taken\nat different altitudes and under different atmospheric conditions, and for the proper alignment of a mosaic and dithered\nexposures, as it is the case of most PINGS observations. An\nIFS observation can be understood as a set of narrow-band\nimages with a band-width equal to the spectral resolution\n(San06). These images can be recentered using the theoretical offsets determined by the DAR formulae (Filippenko\n1982) by tracing the intensity peak of a reference object in\nthe FOV along the spectral range, and recentering it. The\napplication of this method is basically unfeasible in slit spectroscopy, which represents one additional advantage of IFS.\nThe correction can be applied by determining the centroid of\na particular object or source in the image slice extracted at\neach wavelength from an interpolated data cube. Then, it is\npossible to shift the full data cube to a common reference by\nresampling and shifting each image slice at each wavelength\n(using an interpolation scheme), and storing the result in\na new data cube. A pitfall of this methodology is that the\nDAR correction imposes always an interpolation in the spatial direction as described above, a 3-dimensional (3D) data\ncube has to be created for each observed position, reducing\nthe versatility given by the much simpler and handy RSS\nfiles.\nWe have to note here that the widely accepted formulation summarised by the work of Filippenko and the concept\nof parallactic angle are just a first order approximation to\nthe problem. All this theoretical body is based on the assumption that all different atmospheric layers have an equal\nrefraction index, are flat-parallel and perpendicular to the\nzenith. While this approximation is roughly valid, there are\nappreciable deviations due to the topography and landforms\nat the location of the telescope, since they alter considerably\nthe structure of the low-altitude atmospheric layers. Therefore, the \"a posteriori\" correction of the DAR effect, only\npossible when using IFS, is the most accurate approach to\nthe problem.\nIn general, the effects due to DAR in IFS are only important for IFUs with small spatial elements (6 1.5 arcsec)\nwhile for large ones (as it is the case of PPAK), the effect is\nmostly negligible, as experience with the instruments shows,\nespecially when the airmass of the observations is 1.1 or below (Sandin et al. 2008). According to the DAR formulas one\ncan calculate the angular separation in arcsec due to this effect for two different wavelengths under typical atmospheric\nconditions for a range of airmasses (Filippenko 1982, Table 1). If we consider for example the wavelengths of H\u03b1 at\n\u03bb6563 and [O II] \u03bb3727 emission lines, the angular separation\ndue to DAR is smaller than the radius of the PPAK fibres\n(1.35 arcsec) for airmasses below 1.3. Nevertheless, for each\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nobject in the sample we analysed those pointings which were\nobserved at an airmass > 1.2 in order to test any effects due\nto DAR in our data. We transformed these individual pointings into 3D data cubes (with a scale of 1\"/pixel) and we selected suitable sources within the field (e.g. foreground stars,\ncompact bright emission line regions) to perform a DAR\ncorrection creating continuum maps of these bright sources\nand looking for spatial deviations along the dispersion axis.\nNo significant intensity gradients were found in any of the\ntest fields. Additionally, we looked for regions in which we\ncould observe emission in the blue (e.g. [O II] \u03bb3727) but\nno emission in the red (e.g. H\u03b1 \u03bb6563) and vice versa. In\nmost of the cases we did not find strange [O II]/H\u03b1 ratios,\nalthough for some pointings we did not have enough bright\nH II regions to perform this exercise. However, for a number\nof pointings we did find peculiar deviations from the flux\nmeasured in both part of the spectra. All these pointings\nwere observed with an airmass > 1.4 and correspond to:\nNGC 1637 (all 7 dithered pointings), NGC 6701 (all 3 pointings), and NGC 5474 (pointings 3, 4 & 5). These particular\npointings could be individually converted to 3D data cubes\nand be further analysed and corrected for any DAR effects.\nIn the case of particular studies which require a degree of\nspatial precision, one has to bear in mind the significance\nof the spatial-spectral information derived from the individual fibres of these pointings. Integrated spectra over a large\naperture (\u223c 5 arcsec) could be considered reliable.\nConsidering in general that the effects of DAR are very\nsmall given the relatively large size of the spatial elements of\nPPAK, that \u223c 70% of the observations were performed with\nan airmass 6 1.35, and that we found no significant evidence of DAR effects in the analysis of our data (apart from\nthe flagged pointings described above), we decided that no\nDAR correction should be applied when building the final\nspectroscopic mosaics of the PINGS sample, avoiding the\ntransformation of the RSS files to 3D data cubes and the\nundesirable interpolation of data. It is important to note\nthat problems caused by atmospheric dispersion cannot be\ncompletely avoided in the spectroscopic study of extended\nobjects like any other IFS observation, only for those observations performed in dithering mode a correction for the\neffect of DAR can be sought.\n6.5\n\nCross-talk\n\nOne of the critical reduction steps is to extract the flux corresponding to different spectra at each pixel along the dispersion axis (see section 5). However, this is not straightforward\nas there could be contamination by flux coming from the adjacent spectra, i.e. cross-talk. This contamination effect may\nproduce a wrong interpretation of the data. For observations\nperformed with PPAK, and due to the geometrical construction of the instrument, the adjacent spectra on the plane of\nthe CCD may not correspond to nearby locations in the sky\nplane (Kelz et al. 2006). Furthermore, the position of the calibration fibres (which are located in between the science ones\nalong the pseudo-slit) also contributes to overall contamination. Therefore, the cross-talk effect would potentially mix\nup spectra from locations that may not be physically related\n(because of the spectra position on the CCD) or from spectra with completely different nature (i.e. calibration fibres).\nGiven that the cross-talk is an incoherent contamination it\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n17\n\nFigure 10. Example of a strong cross-talk effect in a fibre adjacent to a very bright source, in this case a standard star with\na maximum of 40000 counts. The top spectrum shows the full\ncross-talk effect when no correction is applied. The middle spectrum shows a first-order correction obtained by minimising the\npixel extraction aperture (but losing flux in the process). The\nbottom spectrum shows the correction of the cross-talk by the\nimproved Gaussian-suppression method (described in Paper II)\nwith an extracted spectrum of the same order of intensity as the\naverage background signal (dotted line) found in the nearby fibres for this particular observation. The apparent periodicity of\nthe cross-talk with respect to the wavelength is just an effect of\nthe spectra misalignments and distortions on the CCD.\n\nis preferable to keep it as low as possible, an average value\nof \u223c 1% with a maximum of \u223c 10% (San06, and references\ntherein) seems technically as a good trade-off.\nGiven the limited size of CCDs and the need to record as\nmany spectra as possible within that reduced area, IFS observations will always face a certain level of cross-talk. The\nFWHM of the projected profile along the cross-dispersion\naxis is normally defined by the design of the spectrograph\nand the size of the input fibres, placing a limit in the selected aperture. As explained by San06, the PPAK spectra profiles have a FWHM of the order of \u223c 2.3 pixels, and\n\u2206 peaks of \u223c 5 pixels in the 2 \u00d7 2 binning mode (as was the\ncase for all PINGS observations). Selecting an aperture size\nof the order of \u2206 peaks seems to be an acceptable compromise between maximising the recovered flux and minimising\nthe cross-talk. Several methods have been implemented to\nminimise the effect of cross-talk, in particular, San06 developed an efficient technique named Gaussian-suppression\nthat reduces the effects of the cross-talk and maximises the\nrecovered flux to within 10% of the original values for any\nspaxel at any wavelength. However, for certain raw frames\nwhich were too crowded or when we targeted bright sources\nwithin the field (e.g. foreground stars, galaxy bulges), we\nstill found some level of contamination that could not be\nconsidered negligible.\nTherefore, we improved the Gaussian-suppression technique to a new method which increases the signal-to-noise\nratio of the extracted spectra and reduces the effect of\nthe cross-talk compared to previous extractions. The new\ntechnique is explained in detail in Paper II, and it is now\nfully implemented in the standard R3D package (San06).\nWe performed several tests using simulated and real spectra\n\n\f18\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nwith a broad range of intensities in order to assess the\nlevel of contamination that the extracted spectra show due\nto the cross-talk. We tested the new method varying the\nrelative intensity of the spectra in the central and adjacent\nfibres, the pixel extraction apertures and the average width\nof the Gaussian profiles. We found that in the extreme cases\n(very bright adjacent fibres) the cross-talk is suppressed\nby 95%, being almost negligible for the range of spectral\nintensities compared to the instrumental misalignments\nand distortions found during conventional observations of\nthe PINGS sample (see Figure 10).\nIn summary, the two most important sources of error in\nthe data reduction arise from the sky subtraction and the\nflux calibration. We have made several tests and applied new\ntechniques in each case in order to minimise the magnitude\nof the uncertainties. We found that the sky subtraction cannot be applied as part of any standard reduction pipeline\nand has to be considered on an individual basis, depending on the observing mode, configuration and strategy. On\nthe other hand, the maximum expected error in the absolute flux calibration for those objects in which a broad-band\nimaging recalibration was applied is of the order of 20%, being slightly larger in a narrow blue spectral region \u03bb < 3800\n\u00c5. For those objects without broad-band imaging, the absolute flux calibration error is of the order of 30%. However,\nthe absolute error is better than 20% for objects observed\nduring photometric conditions and/or with high S/N. The\ncolors, spectral features and gradients are completely reproduced when comparing our data with previously published\nlong-slit observations (see subsection 7.1).\nDAR effects were found to be negligible due to the large\nsize of the spatial elements of PPAK, we did not find strong\nevidence of DAR in the several test pointings analysed. However we flagged all individual IFU positions for which the\nobservations were performed with an airmass > 1.3. With\nrespect to cross-talk, the new extraction method proved to\nsuppress this effect to a negligible level for the range of spectral intensities in the PINGS observations. Furthermore, no\nevidence of any second-order contamination has been found\nduring the data reduction and analysis of the PINGS data\nset. As explained in section 4, the contamination of the 2nd\norder, up to 7200 \u00c5, is expected to be lower than 1/10000,\nbeing negligible for our science case.\n\n7\n\nTHE PINGS DATA\n\nThe PINGS data set contains more than 50000 flux calibrated spectra for a sample of 17 galaxies covering in total\nan observed spectroscopic area of nearly 80 arcmin2 . Table 2 shows a summary of the observations, including the\nnumber of individual IFU pointings observed for the mosaic\nof each galaxy, the observational status of the mosaicking,\nthe total number of spectra, and additional individual comments on each object. The spectroscopic data set samples\nthe observed objects with fibre circular apertures of \u223c 2.7\narcsec in diameter, covering the optical wavelength range\nbetween \u223c 3700 \u2013 7100 \u00c5, which includes the most prominent recombination and collisionally excited emission lines\nfrom [O II] \u03bb\u03bb 3727, 3729 to [S II] \u03bb\u03bb 6717, 6731.\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to extract all the\n\ninformation potentially available in this huge spectroscopic\ndata base. Independent studies for individual objects, regions and galaxy subsamples will be presented in a series of\nfuture papers. We consider here a few relevant scientific examples that have been extracted from the data set to demonstrate the use of these data. In this section 4 we present the\nintegrated spectra and emission line intensities for selected\nH II regions of the IFS mosaics of NGC 1058 and NGC 3310,\nwith a comparison to previously published data. Furthermore, we obtained emission line maps for NGC 1058 and\nwe present a qualitative description of the 2D distribution\nof physical properties inferred from the line intensity maps.\nFinally, we present the spectra of the SN 2007gr observed\nin NGC 1058 as an example of the utility of wide-field IFS\nsurveys to find potential SNe progenitors and their environmental properties.\n7.1\n\nIntegrated spectra\n\nThe study of the optical integrated light provides a powerful tool to investigate the physical properties of galaxies\nat different epochs in the history of the universe. Spectral\ninvestigations based on integrated optical spectrophotometry have been used to explore the main drivers of galaxy\nevolution, e.g. star formation rate, star formation history,\nstellar mass, chemical abundance, dust content, etc. (e.g.\nKauffmann et al. 2003; Tremonti et al. 2004). The analysis\nof the integrated spectra in nearby objects can be used to assess the limitations imposed by high-redshift surveys, such\nas their limiting magnitude and incomplete spatial coverage (or aperture bias), factors that may be important given\nthat many physical properties of galaxies vary depending on\nthe geometry and position (e.g. stellar populations, metallicity, extinction, etc.). A solution to the incomplete spatial coverage of spectroscopic observations on nearby objects consists on using sequential methods that use time to\nscan a target while recording the spectral information. The\nstandard method for obtaining integrated spectra in nearby\nobjects was developed by Kennicutt (1992). The so-called\ndrift-scanning technique consists of a scan perpendicular to\nthe slit over the optical extent of the galaxy during a single exposure. Using this method Moustakas & Kennicutt\n2006b (hereafter MK06) obtained spatially integrated optical (3600 \u2013 6900 \u00c5) spectrophotometry for 417 nearby galaxies of a diverse range of galaxy types, which were later used\nto study several integrated galactic properties (SFR, metallicity, etc.).\nOne by-product of 2D spectroscopy and IFS data sets\nis the intrinsic capability of adding up all the spectra within\nan observed field or mosaic into a single spectrum, i.e. using the IFU as a large-aperture spectrograph to obtain the\nintegrated spectra of a given FOV. The PINGS sample is\nan ideal data set for this purpose given that the spectroscopic mosaics cover, in most cases, the entire optical radius\n4\n\nThe analysis of this section was partly based on a set of\nIDL routines created in order to handle and visualise the\n2D spectroscopic mosaics. Although they were first developed for the specific PINGS data format, they can be implemented to any IFS data based on RSS files and corresponding position tables.

The integrated spectra derived from PINGS\ncan be used to study the real average spectroscopic properties of a given nearby, large angular size galaxy, as opposed\nto previous studies that attempted to describe their average properties by the analysis of individual spectra taken\nfrom different regions, or by targeting objects with a limited extraction aperture which recovers only a fraction of\nthe total optical light. In this section we present examples\nof high signal-to-noise integrated spectra for NGC 1058 and\nNGC 3310 obtained by co-adding the spectra from their corresponding mosaics using different simulated apertures applied to the IFS mosaic. We compare these data with previously published integrated spectra from MK06. In Paper II,\nwe present the integrated spectra of NGC 628 with a more\nelaborated analysis of the integrated stellar populations and\nnebular abundances.\nFigure 11 shows in the left upper panel the comparic 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\nson of the integrated spectrum of NGC 1058 extracted from\nthe PINGS mosaic to the drift-scan spectrum obtained by\nMK06 of this galaxy, at the same spectral resolution. The\nright upper panel shows the PINGS spectroscopic mosaic\ndiagram of NGC 1058 with intensity levels corresponding to\na \"narrow-band\" 100 \u00c5 width image extracted from the IFS\ndata centred at H\u03b1. The rectangular shape shows the slitaperture used in the drift-scan technique by MK06 to obtain\nthe integrated spectrum of this galaxy5 . Three foreground\nstars and the supernova SN 2007gr (see subsection 7.4) were\nremoved from the co-added spectra (the arrow shows the position of SN 2007gr between two foreground stars). The black\n\n5\n\nThe simulated extraction slit was registered over the surface of\nthe galaxy by visual comparison to corresponding diagram shown\nby MK06, therefore there is an uncertainty of the correct position\nof the extraction slit over the IFS mosaic of the order of \u223c 2 arcsec.\n\n\f20\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nsolid line spectrum in the left upper panel was obtained by\nextracting from the PINGS mosaic all the individual spectra within the area enclosed by the rectangular shape and\ntaking into account the overlapping regions and the covering\nfraction of the fibres due to the dithering technique applied\nto this galaxy.\nThe blue line corresponds to the spectrum obtained by\nMK06 using the drift-scan technique. The dotted line was\nderived after co-adding all the spectra of the seven IFU positions shown in Figure 11 and considering the dithering\noverlaps. This spectrum is constructed out of 6951 individual spectra covering the whole optical B25 mag arcsec\u22122\nradius of NGC 1058. In this case we can see clearly the effect of the incomplete spatial coverage when comparing the\nintegrated spectrum within the slit-aperture of MK06 and\nthe whole optical radius covered by the PINGS mosaic (dotted line). Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to\ngive a more quantitative comparison, we can notice from a\npurely qualitative point of view that the determination of\nsome physical properties may vary when using both the slitaperture and the whole mosaic integrated spectra, probably\nby as much as \u223c 15 \u2013 20%.\nIn a similar way, the bottom panels of Figure 11 show\nthe integrated spectra of the starburst galaxy NGC 3310.\nThe black line shows the integrated spectrum obtained after co-adding all the spectra within the rectangular pattern\ncorresponding to the MK06 slit-aperture and considering all\nthe overlaps in the mosaic due to the dithering observing\nmethod and the non-standard construction of the mosaic. No\nforeground stars were found within this field. The blue line\ncorresponds to the MK06 drift-scan integrated spectrum.\nIn this case the PINGS extraction is spatially incomplete\nwhen compared to the rectangular area of the MK06 aperture. Nevertheless, all the spectral features are reproduced\nquite well when we compare the PINGS spectrum with the\nMK06 data. The apparent disagreement seen in some of the\nemission lines can be explained by the spatial incompleteness of the IFS mosaic with respect to the MK06 slit, and\nthe presence of a bright H II region at (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4) \u223c (\u201310,\u2013\n30), which is located at the edge of the extraction slit and\npresents particularly strong emission in the [O III] lines. A\nsmall shift of the reported position of the MK06 slit results\nin a slightly different integrated spectrum due to this strong\nH II region, causing that the peaks of the emission lines differ in height. A stronger effect is seen in the blue spectral\nregion (\u03bb < 3800 \u00c5) which is expected due to the intrinsic\nproblems of the spectrophotometric calibration in this regions as explained in section 6. The integrated spectrum of\nNGC 3310 using all the fibres in the three dithered positions\ndiffers very little from the extracted one, and it is not shown\nfor the sake of clarity.\nThe spectroscopic mosaics of NGC 1058 and NGC 3310\nwere not re-calibrated using the broad-band imaging technique described in Paper II, and therefore they are not\ncalibrated for the absolute zero point flux. Nevertheless,\nboth the spectral shape and the spectral features of the\nPINGS extracted spectra corresponding to the slit-aperture\nof MK06 match remarkably well with these previously published, spectrophotometrically calibrated data, showing the\nquality of the PINGS IFS data set.\n\n7.2\n\nEmission line maps\n\nOne of the main objectives of the PINGS project is to obtain complete maps of the emission-line intensities which\ncould then be analysed to describe the 2D spatially-resolved\ndistribution of the physical properties of the sample. The\nPINGS spectroscopic mosaics allow us to obtain for the first\ntime a complete 2D view in the optical wavelength range of\nthe main emission lines used in typical abundance diagnostics methods, and important spectral features useful for the\nanalysis of the underlying stellar populations.\nThe ionized gas in spiral galaxies exhibits a complex\nstructure associated morphologically with star-forming regions located mainly along the spiral arms. Previous attempts to perform a 2D analysis have made use of narrowband and Fabry-Perot imaging at different spectral widths.\nHowever, in some cases the narrow-band imaging includes\nthe contribution of more than one single emission line,\nsuch as the case of the H\u03b1 imaging, which includes the\n[N II] \u03bb\u03bb 6548, 6584 doublet, or the [S II] density sensitive\ndoublet at \u03bb\u03bb 6717, 6731. This factor limits the utilization\nof these techniques to study just the basic parameters of\nthe ionized gas, under the assumption of fixed line ratios.\nThe great advantage of IFS arises from the fact that we are\nable to deblend emission lines at any discrete spatial location, and to ultimately produce maps of individual emission\nlines.\nIn order to extract any physical information from the\ndata set, we need first to identify the detected emission lines\nof the ionized gas and to decouple their emission from the\nstellar population in each individual spectrum of the IFS\nmosaic. We used population synthesis to model and subtract the stellar continuum underlying the nebular emission\nlines. This technique results in emission-line measurements\ncorrected (to a first-order) for stellar absorption. The details\nof this process are described in Paper II, however we present\nbriefly here the scheme followed to decouple the stellar population and the emission lines in our database: i) A set of\nemission lines is identified from any strong H II region of the\ngalaxy. ii) For each spectrum in the data set, the underlying\nstellar population is fitted by a linear combination of a grid\nof Single Stellar Populations (SSP), masking all the nebular\nand sky emission lines. The template models are selected in\norder to cover the widest possible range of ages and metallicities. We consider the effects of dust extinction by varying\nAV from 0 to 1 mag at \u2206 0.2 mag. iii) We subtract the fit\nstellar population from the original spectrum to get a residual pure emission-line spectrum. iv) Finally, we derive the\nintensities for each detected emission line.\nIndividual emission-line fluxes were measured in each\nspectrum by considering spectral window regions of \u223c 200 \u00c5.\nWe performed a simultaneous multi-component fitting using a single Gaussian function (for each emission line contained within each window) plus a low order polynomial\n(to describe the local continuum and to simplify the fitting\nprocedure) using FIT3D (S\u00e1nchez et al. 2006). The central\nredshifted wavelengths of the emission lines were fixed and\nsince the FWHM is dominated by the spectral resolution,\nthe widths of all the lines were set equal to the width of\nthe brightest line in this spectral region. This procedure\ndecreases the number of free parameters and increases the\naccuracy of the deblending process (when required).

In the top-left panel, H\u03b1\nline intensity map, top-right H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux line ratio. Bottom-left, [O II] \u03bb3727, bottom-right [O III] \u03bb4959 + \u03bb5007 intensity maps. All\nmaps were obtained by fitting a single Gaussian function to the emission line for each single spectrum in the mosaic. The intensity map\nis then reconstructed by interpolating the recovered flux at the location of each spectrum as described in the text. All maps are in units\nof 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 . No correction for dust extinction was applied to any map.\n\nintensity fluxes were then measured by integrating the observed intensity of each line. The statistical uncertainty in\nthe measurement of the line flux was calculated by propagating the error associated to the multi-component fitting\nand considering the signal-to-noise of the spectral region.\nWe applied this line-fitting method to NGC 1058 and\ncreated emission line maps by interpolating the intensities\nderived for each individual line in each individual spectrum, correcting for the dithering overlapping effects. The\ninterpolation was performed using E3D, adopting a naturalneighbour, non-linear interpolation scheme, with a final scale\nof 1\"/pixel in the resulting maps. The data at the location\nof bright foreground stars in the field were masked prior to\nany interpolation, in order to decrease the effects of their\ncontamination.\nAs a prime example of this technique for the purpose of this paper, we calculated the following emission\nline maps: H\u03b1, H\u03b2, the doublet-blended [O II] \u03bb3727, and\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n[O III] \u03bb\u03bb 4959, 5007. In order to prevent contamination by\nlow signal-to-noise data, we masked all pixels that correspond to an integrated flux per fibre below 10\u221216 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 . Figure 12 shows the emission line maps in units of\n10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 . The top panels show the distribution of the star-forming regions in the galaxy traced\nby the H\u03b1 intensity map (left) and the distribution of dust\nextinction, outlined by the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio (right). From\nthese maps we note that, although many of the most intense\nemission regions are located along the inner spiral arms of\nthe galaxy, some of them lie in outer regions not associated\nwith any spiral structure (e.g. to the south of the galaxy, at\n\u2206RA \u223c \u201310, \u2206Dec \u223c \u201390 arcsec). On the other hand, the\nH\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio shows a smooth distribution, especially\nconcentrated in the inner part of the galaxy with strong\npeaks in the outlying star-forming regions. As a matter of\nfact, the very intense outlying regions of star-formation are\nresponsible for the difference found in between the inte-\n\n\f22\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\ngrated spectra of NGC 1058 when comparing the central slitaperture of MK06 to the whole mosaic (see subsection 7.1).\nNGC 1058 is known to have a larger than average H I-tooptical size, and deep H\u03b1 imaging has revealed the existence\nof recent massive star formation out to and beyond two optical radii (Ferguson et al. 1998, hereafter FGW98). However,\nthe small number of H II regions analysed in previous studies of NGC 1058 has prevented a complete explanation of\nthe existence of these extreme outer regions, and of the intrinsic scatter of the abundance gradient seen in this galaxy.\nGiven the spatial information provided by the PINGS spectroscopic mosaic, we could in principle study the properties\nof the outer H II regions with those of the inner disk and\ntest the predictions of chemical evolution models and the\nbehavior of the chemical abundances not only as a function\nof increasing radius, but taking into consideration the morphology of the galaxy.\nThe bottom panels show the line intensity distribution\nof [O II] \u03bb3727 (left), and [O III] \u03bb4959 + \u03bb5007 (right). For\nboth cases, we notice strong emission regions at \u2206RA \u223c \u2013\n20 arcsec, and again several outlying emission regions that\ndo not follow the spiral pattern of the galaxy. More definite\ninterpretations than the qualitative ones described here can\nbe achieved with a full spectroscopic analysis of the dust\ncontent, ionization conditions and metallicity distribution\nof the the whole IFS mosaic.\n7.3\n\nEmission line ratios: comparison with\nliterature\n\nSeveral galaxies in the PINGS sample have been spectroscopically studied previously by different authors. As a consistency test of the quality of our data we performed a\ncomparison of several emission line ratios as measured by\nthe procedure described in the previous section with selected H II regions from the literature for which the authors\npublished the emission line ratios for different species. Table 3 shows a comparison of the PINGS emission line intensities for three of those regions: FGW 1058E and FGW\n1058H, analysed by FGW98, and the Jumbo H II region\nin NGC 3310 observed by Pastoriza et al. 1993, (hereafter\nPas93).\nFGW98 observed a total of 8 H II regions in NGC 1058,\nhowever, regions FGW 1058A to D are located in the inner\npart of the galaxy and their identification is somewhat unclear (see Figure 2 from FGW98). Regions FGW 1058F and\nFGW 1058G fall outside the observed FOV of PINGS. On\nthe other hand, FGW 1058E is a bright H II region located\nat \u223c (\u201310, \u201388) arcsec in (\u2206RA, \u2206Dec) units with respect\nto the galaxy centre (see Figure 12), while FGW 1058H is\nan outlying H II region located at \u223c (140, 90) in the PINGS\nmosaic (see Figure 2). For this comparison we selected these\ntwo objects as both fall within the FOV observed by PINGS\nand are uniquely distinguishable from the H\u03b1 maps/images.\nIn the case of FGW 1058, we used for this comparison\na 4 arcsec circular aperture centered on the fibre with the\nstrongest emission in H\u03b1, assuming that the long-slit observation was placed in this region as FGW98 did not give\ndetails of the observation of each specific object and their\ngiven offsets are only approximate with respect to the centre\nof the galaxy (even the extraction aperture is uncertain as\nthey only quote a size range from 3 to 15 arcsec depend-\n\ning on the seeing and on the size of the object in question).\nIn the case of FGW 1058H, the identification was relatively\nsimple as this is a small and well-defined outlying H II region.\nThe emission line ratios for this region were obtained from a\nsingle fibre at the quoted position. FGW98 published the observed and reddening corrected emission line intensities for\n9 spectral lines, in Table 3 we compare our results with the\nobserved un-corrected emission line fluxes only. Additional\nspectral lines and atomic species detected and measured in\nthe PINGS data are also included in Table 3.\nPas93 performed an optical and near-IR spectroscopic\nanalysis of circumnuclear H II regions (at less than 400 pc\nfrom the nucleus) and the Jumbo H II region in NGC 3310.\nThe identification of the circumnuclear H II regions is somewhat difficult in the PINGS mosaic given the linear scale of\nthe regions and the size of the fibres. Therefore we chose to\nanalyse the bright Jumbo H II region for which emission line\nintensities were measured by Pas93. The slit position, aperture and PA are well described by these authors, however\nwe did not choose to simulate an aperture in the PINGS\nmosaic as the aperture of the slit used by Pas93 (1.5 arcsec)\nis smaller than the size of a single PPAK fibre. Instead, we\nchose the fibre within this region with the strongest emission in H\u03b1, which corresponds to an offset (\u201310.6, \u20132.2)\nin (\u2206RA, \u2206Dec) with respect to the galaxy centre in the\nPINGS mosaic.\nPas93 quoted only the reddening corrected line intensities, therefore for this comparison, Table 3 shows the observed and reddening corrected line ratios obtained from\nthe PINGS spectrum extracted for this region. The PINGS\nobserved line intensities listed in Table 3 were corrected\nfor reddening using the Balmer decrement according to\nthe reddening function of Cardelli et al. (1989), assuming\nR \u2261 AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1. Theoretical values for the intrinsic Balmer line ratios were taken from Osterbrock & Ferland\n(2006), assuming case B recombination, an electron density\nof ne = 100 cm\u22123 and an electron temperature Te = 104\nK. We have used only the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio to deduce the logarithmic reddening constant c(H\u03b2), obtaining a value of 0.32\nfor the PINGS spectrum, whereas Pas93 obtained c(H\u03b2) =\n0.29 for the same region. We did not correct the emission line\nfluxes for underlying stellar absorptions. Formal errors in the\nderived line ratios were estimated by summing in quadrature\nthe uncertainty in flux calibration, the statistical error in the\nmeasurement of the line flux and the error in the c(H\u03b2) term.\nDespite the ambiguity due to the exact location and\nextraction aperture of the observed spectra, from Table 3\nwe can see that there is a very good agreement between the\npreviously published emission line ratios and the PINGS observations for these three H II regions. The strongest deviation is found in the [O II] \u03bb3727 as we expected, since this\nline falls in the spectral region at which the instrumental\nlow sensitivity increases the flux calibration error. The comparison with the NGC 1058 regions is more straightforward\nas these are the observed values without any further correction. The comparison of the emission intensities with the\nNGC 3310 Jumbo H II region has to be made carefully since\nthe values of Pas93 were corrected for underlying absorption and using a different reddening curve. Nevertheless, the\nreddening corrected values of PINGS are in good agreement\nwith the values derived by Pas93, we even detected and measured correctly the very faint [O III] \u03bb4363 line, showing the\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\n\n23\n\nTable 3. Comparison of the PINGS emission line intensities for two H II regions in NGC 1058 and one in NGC 3310 with previous\nobservations and published line ratios. For NGC 1058 we compare with the regions E and H by Ferguson et al. (1998), and the Jumbo\nH II region in NGC 3310 observed by Pastoriza et al. (1993). For NGC 1058, the coordinates shown represent approximate offsets of\nthe H II regions with respect to the galaxy nucleus in the PINGS mosaic in the format (\u2206RA, \u2206Dec) with NE positive.

The line strength of the [O III] \u03bb4363\nline combined with the redshift of NGC 3310 makes it fall in\nthe region of \"detectability\" as described in the simulation\npresented in subsection 6.2.\nAn additional assessment of the quality of the data is\ngiven by the value of the I(\u03bb5007)/I(\u03bb4959) ratio which can\nbe predicted from atomic theory and observed in high signalto-noise astronomical spectra. According to current atomic\ncomputations, the theoretical value for this intensity ratio is\n2.98 (Storey & Zeippen 2000). In Table 3 we show this ratio\nfor the three H II regions. The observed central values for the\nregion FGW 1058E in both datasets are in good agreement\nwith the theoretical value. In the case of FGW 1058H both\nvalues are quite similar but differ within the errors from\nthe theoretical value. For the NGC 3310 Jumbo H II region,\nthe central value observed by PINGS is closer to the theoretical value for both uncorrected and corrected line ratios\ncompared to the Pas93 value.\nThe flux observed by PINGS in the H\u03b2 line for\nFGW 1058E is slightly higher than the one measured by\nFGW98, contrary to the case of FGW 1058H, where the flux\nin PINGS for the same line is somehow smaller, reflecting\nthe unknown aperture extraction for the FGW98 long-slit\nspectrum. In the case of the NGC 3310 Jumbo H II region,\nthe flux measured by PINGS is somewhat smaller than the\none measured by Pas93.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n19.5\n\n1096\n\n1690\n\nThe 2D character of the PINGS data allows us to study\nthe variation of the spectra within a given area that would be\notherwise taken as a single H II region. In Figure 13 we show\nthe effect of the extraction aperture on the emission line intensities for the H II region FGW 1058E. FGW98 considered\nFGW 1058E as a single H II region, however a closer look using the dithered spectroscopic mosaic shows that this region\nis actually a complex composed of several knots and substructures with varying emission fluxes in the most prominent lines. In order to examine the difference in the emission\nline ratios in this region, we take as a central position the fibre with the strongest emission in H\u03b1 within this area, with\nan integration aperture of 2.7 arcsec diameter. We then take\nconcentric circular apertures of different sizes (ranging from\n4 to 12 arcsec in diameter), we integrate the spectra within\nthese apertures to obtain spectra from which we measure a\ndifferent set of emission line intensities.\nThe five top panels of Figure 13 show the variation of\nthe emission line ratios obtained at different extraction aperture sizes for some relevant lines (normalised to H\u03b2). The\nsecond data point corresponds to the value shown in Table 3\n(4 arcsec aperture), the horizontal line in each panel shows\nthe central value and the error bar obtained by FGW98 (the\ndark/light blue colour line/band in the online version). The\nbottom panel shows the integrated flux of H\u03b2 at each aperture. From Figure 13 we can see that the emission line ratios\nmeasured using different extraction apertures vary consid-\n\n\f24\n\nRosales-Ortega et al.\n\nFigure 14. Extracted spectrum of the SN 2007gr in the mosaic\nof NGC 1058. The flux units are 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm2 \u00c5\u22121 . Some\nnebular emission lines are seen superimposed to the SN spectrum.\n\nFigure 13. Variation of the emission line ratios as a function\nof integration aperture of the H II region FGW 1058E. The horizontal line/band in each panel shows the value/error derived by\nFGW98. All emission line intensities are normalized to H\u03b2. The\nobserved integrated fluxes of H\u03b2 are in units of 10\u221215 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 .\n\nerably as a function of the aperture size, and that in most\ncases the dispersion of the central values is larger than the\nerror of the measurements, reflecting that this is a physical\neffect. All emission line ratios tend to converge to a certain value as the aperture size increases. Note that at the\nflux level in H\u03b2 measured by FGW98 for this region, all the\nemission line intensity ratios, as measured by PINGS, are\nbasically the same (within errors) as the values derived by\nFGW98.\nFrom this exercise we note that, to a first-order, the\nemission line ratios measured for a given H II region may\nsignificantly depend on the morphology of the region, on\nthe slit (fibre) position, on the extraction aperture and on\nthe signal-to-noise of the observed spectrum. All these effects should be taken into account when deriving physical\nquantities from spectroscopic studies of H II regions.\n7.4\n\nSN 2007gr in NGC 1058\n\nAs another example of the potential of the PINGS spectroscopic data, we present the spectrum of a particular object\nobserved during the mosaicking of the galaxy NGC 1058.\nThe observation of this galaxy was carried out during the\nnights of the 7th and 8th of December 2007. During this period we were able to observe the spectrum of the Supernova\n2007gr, previously discovered by the Lick Observatory Su-\n\npernova Search on the 15th of August 2007 (Chornock et al.\n2007).\nSN 2007gr was located at 24.8\" West and 15.8\"\nNorth of the nucleus of NGC 1058, with coordinates RA\n02h 43m 27.s 98 and Dec: +37\u25e6 20m 44.s 7. In the mosaic diagram of NGC 1058 shown in Figure 11, the arrow shows the\nlocation of SN 2007gr between two bright foreground stars.\nFigure 14 shows the optical spectrum of the supernova extracted from the IFS mosaic, showing the typical spectrum\nof a Type Ic core collapse supernova, with the lack of hydrogen, helium and silicon absorption lines. Emission lines of\n[O II] \u03bb3727, H\u03b1, [N II] \u03bb\u03bb 6548, 6584 and [S II] \u03bb\u03bb 6717, 6731\nare clearly seen on top of the SN spectra, probably reflecting\nthe environment of the H II region in which this supernova\nexploded.\nAs described by Valenti et al. (2008), SN 2007gr showed\nan average peak luminosity but unusually narrow spectral\nlines and an almost flat photospheric velocity profile. SN\n2007gr motivated an extensive observational campaign for\nseveral reasons: it was discovered at a very early stage (5\ndays after the explosion), it was located in a relatively close\ndistance galaxy, it was the nearest stripped-envelope carbonrich SNe ever observed, and a suitable candidate for progenitor search (Valenti et al. 2008). Wide-field IFS may become\none of the main resources for SNe research groups to find\nSNe progenitors in previously observed galaxies. The progenitor supergiant stars (M > 8 M\u2299 ) that at the end of\ntheir lives explode as core-collapse supernovae may show a\nstrong stellar spectrum that could be recovered from 2D\nspectroscopic maps with enough spatial resolution. Furthermore, the nebular emission from the spatially adjacent spectra could provide information on the environment in which\nthese SNe explosions occur.\n\n8\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have presented the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey:\nPINGS, a project designed to construct 2D spectroscopic\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201326\n\n\fPINGS: the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey\nmosaics of 17 nearby disk galaxies in the optical wavelength\nrange. This project represents one of the first attempts to\nobtain continuous coverage spectra of the whole surface of\na galaxy in the nearby universe.\nThe final sample includes different galaxy types, including normal, lopsided, interacting and barred spirals with a\ngood range of galactic properties and SF environments with\nmulti-wavelength public data. The spectroscopic data set\ncomprises more than 50000 individual spectra, covering an\nobserved area of nearly 80 arcmin2 . The data set will be\nsupplemented with broad band and narrow band imaging\nfor those objects without publicly available images in order\nto maximise the scientific and archival value of the observations. Future plans consider to release the PINGS data set in\norder to make it freely available to the scientific community\nas a PPAK legacy project.\nThe primary scientific objectives of PINGS are to obtain\nemission-line maps and moderate-resolution spectra of the\nunderlying stellar population across the disks of the galaxies. These spectral maps will allow us to study the spatial\ndistribution of the physical properties of the ionized gas and\nthe stellar components in galaxies, solving the limitations\nimposed by the small FOV and spectral coverage of previous attempts at obtaining the 2D information of a galaxy.\nPINGS will provide the most detailed knowledge of star formation, gas chemistry and the variations across a late-type\ngalaxy. This information is very relevant for interpreting the\nintegrated colours and spectra of high redshift sources. The\ndetails provided by PINGS will contribute significantly to\nthe study of the chemical abundances and the global properties of galaxies.\nWe have assessed very carefully all sources of errors and\nuncertainties found during the intrinsically complex reduction of IFS observations. This complexity is further deepened if one considers building an IFU spectroscopic mosaic\nof a given object for which the observations were performed\nat very different stages, for some objects even spanning a\nperiod of years.\nTo demonstrate the use of these data, we presented a\nfew relevant scientific examples that have been extracted\nfrom the data set. We presented the integrated spectra of the\nIFS mosaics of NGC 1058 and NGC 3310 and a comparison\nwith previously published data. Furthermore, we obtained\nemission line maps for NGC 1058 and we presented a qualitative description of the 2D distribution of physical properties inferred from the line intensity maps. We performed a\ncomparison of the emission line ratios obtained for a number\nof selected H II regions from the literature, we showed that\nthe emission line intensities obtained from the PINGS data\nagree with previously published studies, and that the line\nratios derived from a single H II region may depend strongly\non the position and aperture size of the slit/fibre (among\nother factors) for a given spectroscopic study. Finally, we\nshowed the spectra of the SN 2007gr observed in NGC 1058\nas an example of the utility of wide-field IFS surveys to find\npotential SNe progenitors and their environmental properties. Independent studies for individual objects, regions and\ngalaxies samples will be presented in future papers. As a\nhighlight of this project, the spectroscopic mosaicking of one\nof the sample objects: NGC 628, represents the largest area\never covered by an IFU observation.
