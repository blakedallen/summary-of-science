INTRODUCTION\n4\n\nSurveys for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) were until recently most commonly conducted in the observed\noptical band (corresponding to the rest-frame UV for\nhigh-redshift AGNs); consequently, our understanding\nof the AGN population is biased toward properties inferred from AGN samples bright in the optical. Radio,\ninfrared, and X-ray surveys have revealed more reddened\nand obscured AGNs, attesting to the presence of an optical bias. AGN surveys in non-optical bands still require optical or UV spectroscopy to confirm the presence of an active nucleus (except for bright, hard X-ray\nselected AGNs, or AGNs with large radio jets) and to\ndetermine the redshift. Historically, our understanding\nof the evolution of the luminous AGN population with\ncosmic time has been based largely on optically selected\nAGN samples; use of samples selected in other bands\nto further this understanding requires proper interpretation of the relations between emission in these bands\nand optical/UV emission for comparison. X-ray surveys\nare more penetrating and efficient in separating the hostgalaxy contribution from the nuclear emission for sources\nwith Lx & 1042 erg s\u22121 , as the integrated host-galaxy Xray emission is negligible compared to the nuclear emission (which contributes 5\u201330% of the AGN bolometric\nluminosity). In order to compare X-ray survey results\non AGN evolution to those in the optical/UV, as well as\n1 Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 525 Davey Lab,\nPennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802\n2 Dipartimento di Astronomia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di\nBologna, Via Ranzani 1, 40127 Bologna, Italy\n3 INAF \u2013 Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna, Via Ranzani 1,\n40127 Bologna, Italy\n4 In this paper \"AGNs\" refers to all types of active galaxies\ncovering the full range of observed luminosities.\n\nto understand better the details of the nuclear environment and the accretion process powering AGNs, we need\nto establish the relations between optical/UV and X-ray\nemission in optically selected samples.\nTananbaum et al. (1979) discovered that a large fraction of UV-excess and radio-selected AGNs are strong\nX-ray sources with X-ray luminosities correlated with\nthose measured in the rest-frame UV. This result was\nconfirmed by Zamorani et al. (1981), who also found\nthat the X-ray emission of AGNs depends on their radio\npower (with radio-loud AGNs being on average \u2248 3\ntimes brighter in X-rays) and that the optical/UV-toX-ray monochromatic flux ratios of AGNs depend on\nrest-frame UV luminosity and/or redshift. The relation\nbetween AGN emission in the rest-frame UV and X-ray\nbands is commonly cast into a ratio of monochromatic\nfluxes called \"optical/UV-to-X-ray index\", \u03b1ox , defined\nas the slope of a hypothetical power law extending\nbetween 2500 \u00c5 and 2 keV in the AGN rest frame5 :\n\u03b1ox = \u22120.3838 log[F\u03bd (2 keV)/F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)]. Studies of\noptical/UV and radio samples of AGNs observed with\nthe Einstein Observatory (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum\n1982; Kriss & Canizares 1985; Avni & Tananbaum\n1986; Anderson & Margon 1987; Worrall et al. 1987;\nWilkes et al. 1994) and ROSAT (e.g., Green et al. 1995)\nconfirmed that over 90% of optically selected AGNs are\nluminous X-ray emitters, that the X-ray emission from\nAGNs (from Seyfert 1s to luminous QSOs) is correlated\nwith the optical/UV emission as well as the radio emis5 The subscript of \u03b1\nox comes from the name \"optical-to-X-ray\nindex\". \"Optical\" is somewhat of a misnomer since it refers to\nthe ultraviolet (2500 \u00c5 rest-frame) monochromatic flux which falls\nin the observed optical band for most bright AGNs studied originally. We use \"optical/UV-to-X-ray index\" instead but retain the\ndesignation \u03b1ox for historical reasons.\n\n\f2\nsion, and that the primary \u03b1ox dependence is most likely\non optical/UV luminosity rather than redshift (but\nsee Yuan, Siebert, & Brinkmann 1998; Bechtold et al.\n2003). The most comprehensive recent study of X-ray\nemission from a radio-quiet (RQ) sample of optically\nselected AGNs is that of Vignali, Brandt, & Schneider\n(2003, hereafter VBS03), who found a stronger \u03b1ox\ndependence on rest-frame UV luminosity than redshift.\nA robust empirical study of the relations between optical/UV and X-ray emission from AGNs provides a\nvaluable basis for theoretical studies of AGN energygeneration mechanisms. As we discuss in \u00a74, there are\nno concrete theoretical studies to date predicting the\nobserved range of \u03b1ox or its dependence on rest-frame\nUV luminosity and/or redshift. A well-calibrated restframe UV-to-X-ray relation can also be used to derive\nreliable estimates of the X-ray emission from optically\nselected, RQ, unabsorbed AGNs and can lead to improved bolometric luminosity estimates. Furthermore,\nrefined knowledge of the \"normal\" range of rest-frame\nUV-to-X-ray luminosity ratios in AGNs is necessary to\ndefine more accurately special AGN subclasses (e.g., Xray weak AGNs) and (under certain assumptions) estimate the X-ray emission associated with jets in RL\nAGNs.\nEstablishing the relations between the intrinsic restframe UV and X-ray emission in optically selected\nsamples (excluding the effects of absorption and jetassociated X-ray emission) can be done efficiently and\naccurately only with samples with a high fraction of Xray detections, optical/UV spectroscopy, and radio classifications. In addition, appropriate statistical-analysis\nmethods developed to detect partial correlations in censored data sets must be used. The advent of largearea, highly complete optical surveys like the 2 degree\nField Survey (2dF, Croom et al. 2001) and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000), coupled\nwith the increased sky coverage of medium-depth X-ray\nimaging (pointed observation with the ROentgen SATellite \u2013 ROSAT, X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission-Newton \u2013\nXMM-Newton, and Chandra X-ray Observatory \u2013 Chandra), make the task of creating suitable samples feasible.\nWe have constructed a sample of 155 SDSS AGNs in\nmedium-deep ROSAT fields, supplemented with a lowredshift Seyfert 1 sample and a high-redshift luminous\nAGN sample (for a total of 228 AGNs), to investigate\nthe relation between rest-frame UV and soft X-ray emission in RQ AGNs. Several important conditions must\nbe met to ensure the appropriateness of the sample and\nstatistical methods:\n1. Large ranges of luminosity and redshift must be\nsampled to reveal weak correlations of \u03b1ox with luminosity and redshift. Additionally, a significant range in\nluminosity at each redshift is necessary to control for\nthe strong redshift dependence of luminosity in fluxlimited samples (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum 1986); this\nrange should be larger than the observed measurement and variability dispersions. Our current sample\nof 228 AGNs covers the largest redshift and luminosity ranges to date, 0.01 < z < 6.3 and 1027.5 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121\n< L\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)< 1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 , without sacrificing a\nhigh X-ray detection fraction or seriously affecting the\nsample homogeneity. The main SDSS sample provides\nadequate luminosity coverage in the 0.2 < z < 3.0 red-\n\nshift range; the addition of the Seyfert 1 and high-z\nAGN samples (see \u00a72) increases the range of luminosities probed at low and high redshifts, respectively.\n2. It is necessary to determine the radio loudness of\neach AGN and to exclude the strongly radio-loud (RL)\nAGNs. RL AGNs have more complex mechanisms of energy generation, such as jet emission, which can obscure\nthe X-ray emission directly associated with accretion\n(particularly if an AGN is observed at a small viewing\nangle). The Faint Images of the Radio Sky at TwentyCentimeters survey (FIRST; Becker, White, & Helfand\n1995) was designed to cover most of the SDSS footprint\non the sky, providing sensitive 20 cm detections (\u223c1 mJy\n\u2013 5\u03c3) and limits that allow us to exclude strongly RL\nAGNs. Some previous studies lacked adequate radio coverage and/or did not separate these two AGN populations.\n3. Because we wish to quantify any evolution of the\nmain intrinsic energy generation mechanism in AGNs,\nit is necessary to exclude AGNs strongly affected by absorption. Strong X-ray absorption in AGNs is often associated with the presence of broad ultraviolet absorption\nlines (e.g., Brandt, Laor, & Wills 2000; Gallagher et al.\n2002). The large observed wavelength range and high\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) of the SDSS spectroscopy is sufficient to find Broad Absorption Line (BAL) AGNs in\n40\u201370% of the sample (see below), allowing us to limit\nthe confusing effects of X-ray absorption.\n4. Special statistical tools are needed to evaluate correlations when censored data points are present. We\nuse the rank correlation coefficients method described by\nAkritas & Siebert (1996) to determine the significance of\ncorrelations in the presence of censored data points, while\ntaking into account third-variable dependencies. Using\nMonte Carlo simulations, we confirm the robustness of\nthe correlation significance estimates. We derive linear\nregression parameters in two independent ways, using the\nEstimate and Maximize (EM) and the Buckley-James regression methods from the Astronomy SURvival Analysis package (ASURV; LaValley, Isobe, & Feigelson 1992;\nIsobe, Feigelson, & Nelson 1985, 1986).\n5. In addition to the use of appropriate statistical\ntools, a large detection fraction is necessary to infer reliable correlations in censored data samples. Anderson\n(1985) and Anderson & Margon (1987) outline the biases that can affect the sample means and correlation\nparameters as a result of systematic pattern censoring.\nOur current sample has 86% X-ray detections (compared\nto \u223c10\u2013 50% for previous studies). One of the assumptions of the statistical methods described in (4), which\ncould be violated, is that the AGNs with upper limits\nand detections have the same underlying distributions\nof \u03b1ox and rest-frame UV luminosity. The effect of this\nassumption is partially alleviated by excluding RL and\nBAL AGNs, but achieving a high detection fraction is the\nonly definitive way to suppress the effect of the unknown\nand likely different distributions of \u03b1ox and rest-frame\nUV luminosity for AGNs with X-ray detections and limits.\n6. The results from statistical analyses must take into\naccount the findings of Chanan (1983), La Franca et al.\n(1995), and Yuan, Siebert, & Brinkmann (1998) that apparent correlations can be caused by a large dispersion\nof the measured monochromatic luminosity in the op-\n\n\f3\ntical/UV relative to the X-ray band. In this work we\nuse Monte Carlo simulations of our sample (as described\nin Yuan 1999) to confirm the robustness of the present\ncorrelations.\n7. Unlike previous studies, we measure directly the\nrest-frame UV monochromatic flux at 2500 \u00c5 in threequarters of the AGNs comprising the SDSS sample,\nwhich guarantees measurement errors of .10%. This\nis made possible by the improved spectrophotometry of\nSDSS Data Release Two (DR2; Abazajian et al. 2004).\n8. Special care is needed to account for the effects of host-galaxy contamination of the rest-frame UV\nmonochromatic flux measurements for low-luminosity\nAGNs. The high-quality and large wavelength range of\nthe SDSS spectra are well suited for this.\n9. If several X-ray instruments or reductions are used\nto measure X-ray monochromatic fluxes, it is necessary\nto assess mission-to-mission cross-calibration uncertainties and the effects of different reduction techniques. The\nmajority of the objects in our sample come from one instrument (the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional\nCounter \u2013 ROSAT PSPC; Pfeffermann et al. 1987) and\nwere processed uniformly (see \u00a72.2), while cross-mission\ncomparisons between ROSAT and XMM-Newton or\nChandra allow estimation of the effects of inhomogeneity\ncaused by mission-to-mission cross-calibration issues.\n10. Due to the timing of most previous studies coupled with the recent precise determination of the cosmological parameters, the \"consensus\" cosmology used for\nluminosity estimates has changed. In what follows, we\nuse the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology parameters from Spergel et al. (2003) to compute the\nluminosities of AGNs: \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, flat cosmology, with\nH0 =72 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nThe largest optically selected AGN sample with a high\nfraction of X-ray detections (& 50%) used for establishing the relations between optical/UV and X-ray emission\nto date is the VBS03 sample of SDSS AGNs in regions of\npointed ROSAT PSPC observations. The VBS03 sample\nconsists of \u223c140 RQ AGNs from the SDSS Early Data\nRelease (EDR; Stoughton et al. 2002) with a soft X-ray\ndetection fraction of \u223c50%, supplemented by higher redshift optically selected AGNs. The second data release of\nthe SDSS provides a large AGN sample (\u223c9 times that\nof the EDR) with accurate spectrophotometry, which together with the large medium-deep ROSAT sky coverage, allows us to improve the VBS03 study significantly\nby increasing the detection fraction to >80% for a similar size sample, while taking into account the effects of\nhost-galaxy contributions in the optical/UV for lower luminosity, nearby AGNs. In this paper we consider in detail the correlation between rest-frame UV and soft X-ray\nemission in AGNs and the dependence of \u03b1ox on redshift\nand rest-frame UV luminosity in a combined sample of\n228 AGNs with no known strong UV absorption or strong\nradio emission.\n2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND X-RAY FLUX\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nAs described in detail below, we start with \u223c35,000\nAGNs from the SDSS DR2 catalog, of which we select\n174 AGNs with medium-deep ROSAT coverage in the\n0.5\u20132 keV band. From the initial sample of 174 AGNs\nwe select 155 by excluding all BAL and strong radio-\n\nFig. 1.- The redshift distributions of the main SDSS sample\n(solid-line histogram), the high-z sample (dashed-line histogram),\nand the Seyfert 1 sample (block-hatched histogram). The hatched\npart of each histogram denotes the AGNs with X-ray detections.\n\nemission objects. The X-ray detection fraction of this\nsample of 155 AGNs is 81%, and we refer to this set as the\n\"main\" sample. We supplement the SDSS data, which\ncover the 0.2 < z < 3.5 redshift range, with additional\nhigh- and low-redshift samples, thereby also increasing\nthe luminosity range covered at the lowest redshifts. We\nnote that all of the main results of this study can be obtained from the main sample alone and are reported separately. The \"high-z\" sample consists of 36 AGNs with 31\nX-ray detections from Chandra and XMM-Newton covering the redshift range 4.0 < z < 6.3. The low-redshift\nSeyfert 1 sample (hereafter \"Sy 1\") consists of 37 AGNs\ndetected with ROSAT and the International Ultraviolet\nExplorer (IUE ) with z < 0.11. We refer to all AGNs\nfrom the main, high-z, and Sy 1 samples as the \"combined\" sample. The combined sample consists of 228\nAGNs with 195 X-ray detections (86%).\nThe redshift distributions of the main, high-z, and Sy 1\nsamples are presented in Figure 1. High-redshift AGNs\nare relatively rare (e.g., see the SDSS DR1 AGN catalog;\nSchneider et al. 2003), and consequently there are only\neight z > 3 AGNs in medium-deep ROSAT pointings\nin our main sample. The median redshift of the main\nSDSS sample is zmedian = 1.3, compared to zmedian = 4.5\nfor the high-z sample, and zmedian = 0.035 for the Sy 1\nsample.\n2.1. SDSS Optical AGN Selection\n\nThe SDSS (York et al. 2000) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey with the ambitious goal of covering a\nquarter of the celestial sphere, primarily at the Northern\nGalactic Cap. AGNs are targeted for spectroscopy based\non a four-dimensional color-selection algorithm which is\nhighly efficient and able to select AGNs redder than\ntraditional UV-excess selection surveys (Richards et al.\n2002, 2003a; Hopkins et al. 2004). Assuming that \u223c15%\nof the AGN population is reddened, SDSS target selection recovers about 40% of these reddened AGNs (G.\nRichards 2004, private communication). Figure 2 dis-\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.- Relative g\u2212i color, \u2206(g \u2212 i), vs. apparent i-band PSF\nmagnitude for the main SDSS sample (solid circles) in comparison\nwith the full SDSS DR2 sample (linearly spaced contours enclosing\n90% of the data and small dots representing the outliers) and 37\nAGNs from the BQS sample with SDSS coverage in DR3 (open\ntriangles). The ten main SDSS sample AGNs, whose relative colors\nare additionally reddened by their host galaxies, have their symbols\nenclosed by large open squares. Note that the main SDSS sample\nis representative of SDSS AGNs in general and that it covers a\ndifferent range of colors than the BQS, as shown for the full SDSS\nAGN sample by Jester et al. (2005). In the computation of \u2206(g\u2212i),\nonly AGNs with point-source morphology were used to determine\nthe median g\u2212i color as a function of redshift to prevent artificial\nreddening due to host-galaxy contamination. This results in poor\nsampling and increased errors at z < 0.08, affecting 12 of the BQS\nAGNs. The four z > 3.1 main-sample AGNs with \u2206(g \u2212 i) values\naffected by the Lyman limit are excluded.\n\nplays the apparent i-band Point Spread Function (PSF)\nmagnitude vs. relative g\u2212i color, \u2206(g \u2212 i), constructed\nby subtracting the median g\u2212i color of DR2 AGNs as\na function of redshift from each observed AGN color in\nour main sample (Richards et al. 2003a). This plot was\ninspired by Jester et al. (2005), who show that the SDSS\nAGN survey includes objects with a much wider range\nof g \u2212 i colors than the brightest B-band selected AGNs\n(even at comparable i-band magnitudes), suggesting that\npopular samples such as the Bright Quasar Survey sample (hereafter BQS; Schmidt & Green 1983) might not\nbe representative of larger and fainter AGN samples with\nred-band flux cuts like the SDSS.6 Figure 2 shows that\nour main SDSS sample is representative of SDSS AGNs\nin general and contains substantially redder AGNs than\n37 BQS AGNs contained in the SDSS Data Release 3\n(DR3; Abazajian et al. 2005) coverage (four additional\nBQS AGNs, whose images are saturated in the SDSS\nexposures, are omitted from this plot). This color difference is caused in part by the shallow B-band cut of the\nBQS survey (sampling of fainter AGNs reveals both red6 At low redshift, intrinsically faint AGNs will have redder colors\nin comparison to bright AGNs due to larger host-galaxy contributions, even when PSF magnitudes are used to estimate the relative\ncolor. This could affect 10 AGNs from the main sample which\nhave substantial host-galaxy contributions (as estimated by their\n3\u2032\u2032 -aperture spectrum at the end of this section), but it will not\naffect significantly the BQS AGNs.\n\nder and bluer AGNs, as the broadening of the \u2206(g \u2212 i)\ndistribution with fainter i shows in Figure 2), as well as\nthe blue-band selection and blue U \u2212 B cut of the BQS\n(Jester et al. 2005).\nWe ensure that all SDSS AGNs considered here\nwere targeted as one of the QSO target subclasses\n(Stoughton et al. 2002; Richards et al. 2002), excluding\nobjects targeted solely as FIRST or ROSAT sources.\nThe efficiency of the SDSS target selection (spectroscopically confirmed AGNs as fraction of targets) is \u223c66%,\nwhile the estimated completeness (fraction of all AGNs\nabove a given optical flux limit in a given area that are\ntargeted) is \u223c95% for point sources with i < 19.1, which\ndrops to \u223c60% for the high-redshift selection at i = 20.2\n(Richards et al. 2005; Vanden Berk et al. 2005).7 SDSS\nData Release 2 (DR2) contains over 35,000 AGN spectra in \u223c2630 deg2 covering the observed 3800\u20139100 \u00c5 region (Abazajian et al. 2004). The initial sample selected\nfor this work consists of 174 SDSS AGNs situated in areas covered by 49 medium-deep (11 ks or longer) ROSAT\nPSPC pointings (see \u00a72.2).\nRL AGNs tend to have higher X-ray luminosity for\na given rest-frame UV luminosity (i.e., flatter \u03b1ox values) than RQ AGNs. It is believed that the additional\nX-ray emission is associated with the radio rather than\nthe UV component (e.g., Worrall et al. 1987), so we\nneed to exclude the strongly RL objects if we want to\nstudy UV-X-ray correlations and probe the energy generation mechanism intrinsic to all AGNs. All but three\nof the 174 SDSS AGNs in the initial sample have detections within 1.5\u2032\u2032 or upper limits from FIRST. Based\non the FIRST data and the Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2002) definition of radio-to-optical monochromatic flux, we find\nnine strongly RL AGNs. Following Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2002),\nwe define the radio-loudness parameter, R, as the logarithm of the ratio of the radio-to-optical monochromatic flux: R = log(F20 cm /Fi ) = 0.4(i \u2212 m20 cm ), where\nm20 cm is the radio AB magnitude (Oke & Gunn 1983),\nm20 cm = \u22122.5 log(F20 cm /3631[Jy]), and i is the SDSS\ni-band magnitude, corrected for Galactic extinction. We\nset the radio-loudness threshold at R = 1.6, excluding\nobjects with R > 1.6. Two of the remaining three AGNs\nwith no FIRST coverage have upper limits from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array\nSky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, with typical sensitivity of \u223c2.5 mJy for 5\u03c3 detections) which are consistent with our RQ definition. The radio loudness of the\nremaining AGN (SDSS J2314+1407) is not tightly constrained by its NVSS limit (R < 1.8). Taking into account that the NVSS constraint is close to our chosen\nthreshold of R = 1.6 and that only \u223c10% of AGNs are\nRL, it is unlikely that this single AGN is RL, so we retain\nit in the main SDSS sample. Excluding the strongly RL\nAGNs reduces the sample of 174 to 165 objects.\nThe large optical wavelength coverage of the SDSS\nspectra allows identification of BAL AGNs at 1.55 <\nz < 4.80 via C IV absorption (\"High-ionization BALs\"\n\u2013 \"HiBALs\") and 0.45 < z < 2.25 via Mg II absorption\n(\"Low-ionization BALs\" \u2013 \"LoBALs\"), as well as weakabsorption AGNs (i.e., absorption not meeting the BAL\n7 This estimate of completeness considers only sources with\nAGN-dominated optical/UV spectra.\nAdditional opticallyunremarkable AGNs might also be missed.\n\n\f5\ncriteria of Weymann et al. 1991). BAL AGNs, with an\nobserved fraction of 10\u201315% in optically selected samples\n(Foltz et al. 1990; Weymann et al. 1991; Menou et al.\n2001; Tolea, Krolik, & Tsvetanov 2002; Hewett & Foltz\n2003; Reichard et al. 2003b), are known to be strongly\nabsorbed in the soft X-ray band and thus to have\nsteep \u03b1ox values (e.g., Brandt, Laor, & Wills 2000;\nGallagher et al. 2002). There are 20 AGNs with some\nUV absorption in the SDSS RQ AGN sample of 165,\nten of which are BAL AGNs by the traditional definition (troughs deeper than 10% of the continuum, at least\n2000 km s\u22121 away from the central emission wavelength,\nspanning at least 2000 km s\u22121 ; Weymann et al. 1991).\nEight of the BAL AGNs are HiBALs (out of a possible\n67 AGNs with 1.55 < z < 4.80), and there are two LoBALs (out of a possible 116 AGNs with 0.45 < z < 2.25).\nOnly three of the ten BALs are serendipitously detected\nin deeper XMM-Newton exposures (one LoBAL with\n\u03b1ox = \u22121.6 and two HiBAL with \u03b1ox = \u22121.7, see \u00a7 2.2),\nthe remaining seven BALs have \u03b1ox upper limits ranging between \u22121.4 and \u22122.0, depending on the sensitivity of the ROSAT exposures. Exclusion of the 10 BAL\nAGNs reduces the sample from 165 to 155 objects. We\nexpect there to be \u2248 8 more HiBAL and . 1 more\nLoBAL AGNs (for a typical LoBAL:HiBAL ratio of 1:10;\nReichard et al. 2003b) which we are unable to identify\nbecause of a lack of spectral coverage in the C IV or\nMg II regions. We will estimate the effects of missed\nBALs on our sample correlations by selectively excluding the steepest \u03b1ox sources in the appropriate redshift\nintervals.\nThree-quarters of the AGNs (117 objects) in the\nmain SDSS sample of 155 allow direct measurement of\nthe rest-frame 2500 \u00c5 monochromatic flux, F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5),\nfrom the SDSS spectrum. SDSS DR2 reductions have\nsubstantially improved spectrophotometry relative to\nearlier data releases (better than 10% even at the\nshortest wavelengths,8 see also \u00a74.1 of Abazajian et\nal. 2004) but do not include corrections for Galactic extinction. To correct the SDSS monochromatic\nflux measurements for Galactic extinction we use the\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) dust infrared emission maps to estimate the reddening, E(B \u2212 V ), at each\nAGN position9 and the Nandy et al. (1975) extinction\nlaw with R = AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.14 to estimate the\nGalactic extinction, AV , as a function of wavelength.\nThe Galactic extinction correction is <10% at 2500 \u00c5\nin \u223c80% of the cases considered.\nThe remaining quarter (38 objects) of the main SDSS\nsample AGNs lack 2500 \u00c5 rest-frame coverage in the observed 3800\u20139100 \u00c5 spectroscopic range. We use spectroscopic monochromatic flux measurements at rest-frame\n3700 \u00c5 (30 AGNs with z < 0.5) and 1470 \u00c5 (8 AGNs\nwith 2.7 \u2264 z \u2264 4.5) with the appropriate optical spectral slopes, \u03b1o (assuming F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1o ), to determine the\nmonochromatic flux at 2500 \u00c5. Based on over 11,000\nAGNs from DR2 with both 1470 \u00c5 and 2500 \u00c5 monochromatic flux measurements, we estimate that an optical\nslope of \u03b1o = \u22120.73 gives the best agreement between the\n8 Details about the spectrophotometry can be found at\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr2/products/spectra/spectrophotometry.html.\n9\nThe\ncode\nis\navailable\nat\nhttp://www.astro.princeton.edu/\u223cschlegel/dust/index.html.\n\nFig. 3.- Example high S/N AGN + host-galaxy decompositions for two low-redshift spectra with dominant host-galaxy (upper) and AGN (lower) contributions.

This is redder (steeper) than\nthe \"canonical\" AGN slope over the optical-and-UV region of \u03b1o = \u22120.5 (Richstone & Schmidt 1980) because of the presence of the \"small blue bump\" (see the\ndiscussions on the variation of spectral slope with the\nrest-wavelength measurement range in Natali et al. 1998;\nSchneider et al. 2001; Vanden Berk et al. 2001). The error of the F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) estimate due to the F\u03bd (1470 \u00c5)\nextrapolation is typically less than 25%. A canonical\nslope of \u03b1o = \u22120.5 between 2500 \u00c5 and 3700 \u00c5 provides good agreement between the direct 2500 \u00c5 and the\nF\u03bd (3700 \u00c5)-extrapolated monochromatic fluxes, based\non 2,400 DR2 AGNs with 0.5 < z < 0.8. The error\nin F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) expected due to variations in the 2500\u2013\n3700 \u00c5 optical slope is typically less than 20%. In\naddition, because the direct F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) measurement\nincludes a varying contribution from Fe II emission,\nF\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) could overestimate the true nuclear flux by\n10\u201325% (as determined from \u223c40 Fe II-subtracted mainsample AGNs and comparison of F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) and the relatively Fe II-free F\u03bd (2200 \u00c5) measurement of \u223c106 main\nsample AGNs), leading to a < 3 % error in \u03b1ox . The\npossible overestimate of F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) due to Fe II emission does not correlate with luminosity or redshift and\nhas no material effect on the subsequent analysis.\nAn additional correction is necessary for the\nF\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) estimates for low-redshift AGNs. If not subtracted, the host-galaxy contributions of the 36 AGNs\nwith z < 0.55 could lead to potentially large overestimates of rest-frame monochromatic UV fluxes of the\nAGNs. To obtain a reliable estimate of the AGN contribution at 2500 \u00c5 for the z < 0.55 AGNs, we fit each\nobserved spectrum with host-galaxy plus AGN compo-\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 4.- The rest-frame monochromatic UV luminosities of the\nSDSS main (circles), high-z (squares), and Sy 1 (triangles) samples\nvs. redshift.

The host-galaxy and AGN components were\ncreated using the first 3\u201320 galaxy and AGN eigenspectra obtained from large SDSS samples by Yip et al.\n(2004a,b). In the AGN (host-galaxy) case, >90% of the\nvariation is explained by the first five (three) eigenspectra. Two high S/N example fits are shown in Figure 3.\nThe host-galaxy corrections (as measured at 3700 \u00c5) are\nnegligible for six of the 36 low-redshift AGNs and are\n\u226420% for 20 additional AGNs.\nIn what follows, we use f2500 \u00c5 = log(F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)[Jy])\nto denote the logarithm of the rest-frame\nmonochromatic UV flux at 2500 \u00c5, and luv =\nlog(L\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)[erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ]) to denote the logarithm of\nthe corresponding monochromatic luminosity. The restframe monochromatic UV flux (no band-pass correction\nwas applied) and monochromatic luminosity (band-pass\ncorrected) measurements for the main SDSS sample of\n155 objects are presented in columns 7 and 12 of Table 1,\nwith the spectroscopic redshift in column 2, the SDSS\nPSF i-band extinction-corrected apparent magnitude in\ncolumn 13, and the \u2206(g \u2212 i) color in column 14.

The selection bias toward more luminous\nAGNs at higher redshift is evident.\n2.2. X-ray Detections\nIn order to ensure a high soft X-ray detection fraction\nfor the optically selected AGNs, we start with a subsample consisting of SDSS AGNs falling within the inner\n19\u2032 of 49 ROSAT PSPC observations longer than 11 ks.\nThe median total exposure time is \u223c16.7 ks with individual pointing exposure times ranging between 11.8 and\n\nFig. 5.- Number of SDSS DR2 AGNs within the inner 19\u2032 of\nROSAT PSPC fields (top) and percentage of SDSS AGNs detected\nby ROSAT (bottom) as a function of the minimum ROSAT exposure time. No RL or BAL AGNs were removed. The estimates\nwere done at discrete intervals given by the solid circles; the connecting lines are meant to guide the eye. The vertical dashed lines\nshow our choice of minimum exposure time. Our final detection\nfraction (see Table 1) is >75% for a minimum exposure time of\n11 ks due to the addition of XMM-Newton and Chandra detections. The hatched region in the bottom plot is an approximate\nregion taken by BALs in optical surveys (see \u00a7 2.1), bounding the\nrealistically achievable X-ray detection fraction in optical samples\nto a maximum of \u223c85\u201390%.\n\n65.6 ks.10 This approach does not introduce biases into\nthe main sample since the SDSS does not specifically target ROSAT pointed-observation areas, and we exclude\none SDSS AGN which was targeted as a ROSAT source\nbut failed the SDSS AGN color selection. At the time\nof writing, the completed ROSAT mission has the advantage (compared to Chandra and XMM-Newton) of a\nlarge-area, uniformly reprocessed, and validated dataset.\nFigure 5 illustrates the trade-off between large sample\nsize and high X-ray detection fraction of SDSS AGNs\nin ROSAT PSPC pointed observations (no BALs or RL\nAGNs were removed for this plot). Pointings with exposure times & 10 ks are necessary to achieve 70\u201380% detections in statistically large samples of SDSS DR2 AGNs.\nNote that detection fractions of 100% are unrealistic to\nexpect with serendipitous, medium-deep, soft X-ray coverage of optical AGN samples. For example, most BALs,\ncomprising 10\u201315% of optical samples, will remain Xray undetected. In our initial sample, none of the ten\nknown BALs is detected with ROSAT, and only three\nof the ten are detected in deeper XMM-Newton exposures. The highest realistically achievable detection fraction for optical samples is 85\u201390%, compared to 81% in\nour main sample (see \u00a73.1). Using the full PSPC field instead of the inner 19\u2032 would result in a six-fold increase of\nthe X-ray coverage area available for SDSS matches, but\nwith larger uncertainties in the measured fluxes and an\nincreased fraction of non-detections. The selected subsample contains 155 SDSS AGNs in 49 ROSAT PSPC\n10 The effective exposure times for individual sources (given in\nTable 1) will be shorter, depending on the source off-axis angle.\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 6.- Distribution of angular offsets between the SDSS and\nROSAT PSPC positions. The ROSAT PSPC pixel size is 15\u2032\u2032 ,\nand all matches are within \u223c2 ROSAT pixels. The AGN with the\nlargest (33\u2032\u2032 ) offset is SDSS J0255\u22120007, which was also detected\nas 1WGA J0255.1\u22120007 within 11\u2032\u2032 of the SDSS position in the\n0.24\u20132.0 keV 1 WGA catalog.\n\npointings. The total solid angle covered by the inner 19\u2032\nof these 49 pointings is \u223c15 deg2 (\u223c0.57% of the DR2\narea covered by spectroscopy). To avoid large uncertainties in the X-ray flux measurements due to uncertain source counts, we have excluded two AGNs which\nare close to the much brighter X-ray source NGC 4073\n(2\u2032 and 4\u2032 from the pointing center). We also replaced\nthe ROSAT flux of SDSS J1331\u22120150 (which falls within\nthe cluster Abell 1750), and those of SDSS J1242+0229,\nSDSS J0942+4711, and SDSS J0943+4651 (which had\n2\u20133\u03c3 detections in the ROSAT 0.5\u20132 keV band), with\ntheir XMM-Newton detections.\nWe performed circular-aperture photometry using\nsource photons with energies of 0.5\u20132.0 keV to obtain the\ncount rates. The exclusion of < 0.5 keV photons was necessary to reduce the effects of absorption due to neutral\nmaterial (both in our Galaxy and intrinsic to the AGNs),\nsoft X-ray excesses, and ROSAT PSPC calibration uncertainties on the measured flux. The average aperture\nsize used was 60\u2032\u2032 , with a range of 45\u2032\u2032 \u201390\u2032\u2032 to accommodate the presence of close companions and large off-axis\nangle sources. The count rates were aperture corrected\nusing the integrated ROSAT PSPC PSF.11 The original\napertures encircled >90% of the ROSAT flux in \u223c83%\nof the cases; all aperture corrections were <20% of the\nmeasured count rate. The background level was determined for each field from a 14\u201325 times larger area with\nsimilar effective exposure time to the source. The circular aperture for each source was centered at the SDSS\nposition in all but ten cases where the X-ray centroid in\nan adaptively smoothed image12 was \u223c1-2 pixels (corresponding to \u223c15\u201330\u2032\u2032) away from the SDSS position.\n11\nhttp://wave.xray.mpe.mpg.de/exsas/usersguide/node136.html.\n12\nWe\nuse\nthe\nChandra\nInteractive\nAnalysis\nof\nObservations\n(CIAO)\ntask\ncsmooth,\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao3.0/ahelp/csmooth.html.\n\nFig. 7.- Distribution of X-ray fluxes (hatched histogram) and\nupper limits (open histogram) for the SDSS main sample.\n\nThe distribution of SDSS\u2013ROSAT PSPC offsets (with\nthe X-ray centroids in the adaptively smoothed PSPC\nimages serving as ROSAT positions) for the main sample is shown in Figure 6. The \u223c33\u2032\u2032 offset in Figure 6\nis that of SDSS J0255\u22120007, with an off-axis angle of\n18\u2032 , which is also detected in the 0.24\u20132.0 keV 1 WGA\ncatalog13 (White et al. 1994) with an X-ray flux consistent with our measurement, and a positional offset of\n11 \u00b1 50\u2032\u2032 . In order to determine the number of possible false SDSS\u2013ROSAT matches, we extract all unique\nsources with off-axis angles < 19\u2032 from the full ROSAT\nPSPC catalog obtained from the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center14 (HEASARC)\nmedium-deep ROSAT pointings. To obtain the expected\nfraction of false matches, we repeatedly shift all SDSS\nAGN positions by a random amount in the range 0.11\u25e6 and rematch them with the ROSAT PSPC catalog.\nThe false-match fraction for SDSS\u2013ROSAT PSPC offsets < 40\u2032\u2032 is < 0.1% (i.e., less than one source for the\nmain SDSS sample), which is further supported by our\nprevious experience (see VBS03).\nTable 1 gives the X-ray observation ID (column 3), effective exposure time (4), off-axis angle (5), total source\ncounts (6), logarithm of the 0.5\u20132.0 keV flux (8), logarithm of the rest frame 2 keV monochromatic flux \u2013\nf2 keV , not band-pass corrected (9), and logarithm of the\nrest frame 2.0 keV monochromatic luminosity \u2013 lx , bandpass corrected (11) for each source in the main SDSS\ncatalog. The 0.5\u20132 keV flux histogram of the main SDSS\nsample is shown in Figure 7. The soft X-ray detection\nlimit for the inner 19\u2032 of the medium-deep ROSAT observations used here is \u223c2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The fluxes\nwere estimated using PIMMS15 assuming a power-law Xray spectrum with photon index \u0393 = 2 and the Galactic\nhydrogen column density obtained by Stark et al. (1992).\nPrevious studies suggest that AGN photon indices do not\n13\n14\n15\n\nhttp://wgacat.gsfc.nasa.gov/wgacat/wgacat.html.\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/.\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/tools/pimms install.html\n\n\f8\nvary systematically with redshift (e.g., Page et al. 2003;\nVignali et al. 2003), although the scatter (\u223c0.5) around\nthe mean value is substantial for all redshifts. Assuming\na constant \u0393, when in reality 1.5 < \u0393 < 2.5 for the different sources, affects our flux measurements by . 4%.\nFour of the selected 155 SDSS AGNs were the targets of\ntheir respective ROSAT pointed observations (marked\nby note 1 in Table 1). Their inclusion in the main sample could have a small effect on the sample correlations,\nas the four AGNs do not comply with our selection criteria \u2013 optically selected AGNs serendipitously observed\nin medium-deep ROSAT pointings. Three of the four\nAGNs are not substantially different in their rest-frame\nUV and X-ray properties from the rest of the sample,\nwhile SDSS J1701+6412 is the UV-brightest AGN in the\nmain sample. We opt to retain the four ROSAT targets\nin the main sample, while ensuring that their presence\nhas no material effect on any of our conclusions (see \u00a7 3.2\nand \u00a7 3.3).\nA total of 40 of the 155 SDSS AGNs (26%) were not\ndetected in the 0.5\u20132.0 keV band by ROSAT. One of\nthe 40 SDSS AGNs, SDSS J1400+6225, is not detected\nby ROSAT but is detected serendipitously on CCD S2\nof a Chandra ACIS-S (Garmire et al. 2003) observation. We used ACIS Extract (Broos et al. 2004), which\nutilizes Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations\n(CIAO v.3.0.2)16 tools, to estimate the 0.5\u20132.0 keV flux.\nNine additional AGNs with ROSAT upper limits were\nserendipitously detected in XMM-Newton (Jansen et al.\n2001) observations, as indicated in column (3) of Table 1. We use the count rates in the 0.5\u20132 keV band\nof the first XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalog \u2013\n1XMM SSC17 (Watson et al. 2003), whenever available\n(four sources), to obtain the XMM-Newton fluxes. For\nthe remaining five XMM-Newton detected sources which\nare not in 1XMM SSC, we use the source lists provided\nby the standard XMM-Newton processing to extract the\n0.5\u20132.0 keV count rates. When a source is detected by\nmore than one XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001), we\naverage the estimated fluxes weighting by the quoted errors and report the MOS total counts and effective exposure times in Table 1. An additional 14 sources detected by ROSAT are also detected by XMM-Newton.\nThe 0.5\u20132.0 keV fluxes of these 14 AGNs agree within\n0.4 dex (a factor of 2.5) in 12 of the cases, and the\nXMM-Newton detections are more likely to be brighter\nby \u223c30%. Taking into account that four of the ROSAT\ndetections are 2\u20133\u03c3 and that AGNs are variable on scales\nof hours to years (see the discussion of AGN X-ray variability in \u00a7 3.5.1), we consider this agreement adequate\nfor inclusion of the XMM-Newton detected AGNs with\nno ROSAT detections into our sample.\nA total of 14 AGNs in our main sample have\nXMM-Newton (13/14) or Chandra (1/14) detections\nreplacing the ROSAT upper limits (10/14) or lowconfidence/cluster-contaminated detections (4/14). The\nXMM-Newton/Chandra observations could be more\nlikely to \"catch\" the SDSS AGNs in a high-luminosity\nstate, if the difference between the ROSAT limiting flux\nand the XMM-Newton/Chandra detection flux is suffi16\n17\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/\nhttp://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/newpages/xcat public.html\n\nciently small in comparison to AGN variability. Four\nof the 14 AGNs with XMM-Newton/Chandra detections\nhave fluxes above their ROSAT limits (\u223c30% higher) and\ncould have been detected with XMM-Newton/Chandra\nonly because they were in a high-luminosity state. The\nremaining ten AGNs were detected in more-sensitive\nXMM-Newton/Chandra observations. On account of\nthese possible \"high-state\" detections and the tendency\nof some XMM-Newton detections to provide brighter\n0.5\u20132.0 keV fluxes than the corresponding ROSAT detections, we will consider the effect of excluding all 14\nXMM-Newton/Chandra detected AGNs on the subsequent correlations.\n2.3. The High-Redshift Sample\n\nTo increase the redshift and luminosity coverage of\nthe optically selected AGN sample, we add an auxiliary sample of 36 AGNs at z > 4. These high-z AGNs\nwere selected from 44 AGNs specifically targeted for Xray imaging with Chandra (19 SDSS AGNs, 16 Palomar\nDigital Sky Survey AGNs; Djorgovski et al. 1998; and\nseven AGNs from the Automatic Plate Measuring facility survey, Irwin, McMahon, & Hazard 1991) and XMMNewton (2 SDSS AGNs) reported in Tables 3 and A1 of\nVignali et al. (2003). The 36 high-z AGNs were selected\nfrom the original 44 AGNs by excluding three strongly\nradio-loud (R > 1.6) AGNs and five BAL AGNs. This\nsample is somewhat more heterogeneous in its optical\nselection (although all z < 5.4 high-z AGNs would have\nmade the SDSS AGN target selection), contains only the\nhighest rest-frame UV luminosity AGNs, and was specifically targeted for X-ray observations. Consequently we\ncarefully consider the effect of its addition to the main\nsample on the rest-frame UV-X-ray relations reported\nbelow.\n2.4. The Seyfert 1 Sample\nAs noted in \u00a7 1, the significance of UV-X-ray correlations depends on the range of luminosities probed for\neach redshift. The SDSS selects photometric targets for\nspectroscopic follow-up in two magnitude ranges \u2013 lowredshift targets are magnitude limited at i < 19.1 and\nhigh-redshift targets at i < 20.2. Mainly due to the\nlarge solid angle covered by the SDSS, but also on account of its two different optical flux limits, the main\nSDSS sample probes a luminosity range of at least an\norder of magnitude at each redshift, except at z . 0.2\nand z & 3. In order to increase the luminosity range\nfor low-redshift AGNs, we consider an additional sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies with measurements from both\nIUE and ROSAT. The majority of objects were selected from the Seyfert 1 list of Walter & Fink (1993) to\nhave direct monochromatic flux measurements at both\n2675 \u00c5 and 2 keV (see their Table 1) and L\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) >\n1027.5 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 . NGC 3516 (Kolman et al. 1993) was\nadded to the Walter & Fink (1993) Seyfert 1 list, and\nthe I Zw 1 measurements were replaced with recent,\nmore accurate estimates from Gallo et al. (2004). The\nmonochromatic flux measurements at 2675 \u00c5 were not\ncorrected for host-galaxy contamination, which we expect to be small at this wavelength for most sources.\nWe inspected visually a few high S/N IUE spectra\nwhich showed no strong host-galaxy features. To exclude\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 8.- The 2 keV vs. 2500 \u00c5 monochromatic luminosities\nfor the SDSS main sample (solid circles), the high-z sample (open\nsquares), and the Sy 1 sample (open triangles). Arrows indicate\nupper limits. The solid line is the best-fit linear relation for the\ncombined sample: lx = 0.648luv + 6.734, and the dotted line is an\narbitrarily normalized line with a slope of one.\n\nstrongly radio-loud objects we consider only Seyfert 1s\nwith L\u03bd (5 GHz) < 1025 W Hz\u22121 , where we use the 5 GHz\nfluxes from Walter & Fink (1993) and additional 1.4 GHz\nflux measurements (extrapolated to 5 GHz) from NED18 ,\nand exclude all Seyferts with unknown radio flux from\nFIRST or NVSS. Our final Seyfert 1 list consists of 37\nAGNs. This sample is not biased in the sense that it includes only X-ray detections of known optical AGNs. It\nis not, however, purely optically selected; consequently,\nwe evaluate all correlations with and without the Sy 1\nsubsample, to control for any possible systematics.\n3. CORRELATION ANALYSIS\n3.1. Detection Fractions\n\nA high X-ray detection fraction, which minimizes\nthe effects of systematic pattern censoring and statistical assumptions, is essential for accurate determination of AGN UV-X-ray properties (see \u00a7 1). As can\nbe seen in Figure 7, most sources with F (0.5-2 keV) >\n2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 are detected for an overall detection fraction of 126/155 (81%) in the main SDSS sample.\nThe X-ray detection fractions (X-ray detected vs. total\nnumber) for the main, high-z and combined (main, highz, and Sy 1) samples are given in Table 1.\n3.2. Monochromatic Optical/UV and X-ray\n\nLuminosities\nFigure 8 shows the relation between the 2 keV and\n2500 \u00c5 monochromatic luminosities. The correlation is\nsignificant at the 11.5\u03c3 (7.4\u03c3) level, after the redshift\ndependence of both quantities and all upper limits are\ntaken into account for the combined sample of 228 AGNs\n(the main SDSS sample of 155 AGNs). The partial\nKendall's correlation coefficient (Akritas & Siebert 1996)\n18\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\nis \u03c4 12,3 =0.38 (\u03c4 12,3 =0.28) for the combined (main) sample (see Table 1).\nIn order to test the partial-correlation method, we created mock datasets with variable dispersion and strong\nredshift dependence. We consider cases of (1) no relation between the dependent and independent variables\nand (2) a linear relation between the dependent and independent variables. In both cases we assume that the\nUV monochromatic luminosity is a polynomial function\nof redshift with a luminosity range of about an order of\nmagnitude at each redshift, which includes a normally\ndistributed dispersion (with standard deviation equal to\nthe observed regression residuals from Table 1) to both\nthe UV and X-ray monochromatic luminosities to simulate the uncertainty due to variability and measurement\nerrors. The \"true relation\" simulation further assumes\nthat Eqns. 1\u20133 given below hold, while the \"no relation\"\nsimulation assumes that the X-ray monochromatic luminosity is a different polynomial function of redshift.\nWhen we match the observed redshift distribution and\nnumber of X-ray upper limits, we confirm the existence of\nthe mock-linear relations with similar statistical significance to the significance found for the real datasets, \u223c12\u2013\n14\u03c3 in the mock-combined and \u223c8\u201310\u03c3 in the mock-main\nsimulated samples, weakly dependent on the ratio (varying between 0.5 and 2.0 in our simulations) of dispersions\nassumed for the dependent and independent variables.\nFor \"no relation\" simulations, spurious correlations of\nup to 4\u03c3 in the mock-main and up to 7\u03c3 in the mockcombined sample are possible. The apparent high significance of the \"no-relation\" simulations is caused by our\nlack of knowledge of the true mean dependence of the\nmonochromatic luminosity on redshift in the UV and Xray bands separately, combined with the observational\nconstraint on the range of luminosities probed at each\nredshift. The simulation set-up is further affected by\nthe fact the observations constrain only the total dispersions along the lx \u2013luv , luv \u2013z, and lx \u2013z relations, without\nstrong constraints on the contribution of variability and\nmeasurement error. By necessity, the polynomial fits we\nuse in the simulation to represent the mean luv \u2013z and\nlx \u2013z relations are very similar, and consequently simulations with significant spurious correlations are possible.\nHowever, in no simulation where we match the observed\nluv \u2013z and lx \u2013z distributions (in both their mean relations and dispersions) as well as the observed lx \u2013luv dispersion, are the \"no relation\" correlations found significant enough to cause the observed lx \u2013luv correlations.\nAdditionally, in all simulated cases the significance of\nthe \"true relation\" simulation is sufficiently higher than\nthe corresponding \"no relation\" case, allowing for easy\ndistinction between the two. Consequently, we are convinced that 11.5\u03c3 (7.4\u03c3) level correlations found for the\ncombined (main) samples are unlikely to arise on account\nof the strong redshift dependence of the UV and X-ray\nmonochromatic luminosities.\nThe best-fit relations, assuming no redshift dependence\n\n\f10\n(see the discussion below), are\nlx (luv ) = (0.645 \u00b1 0.034)luv + (6.851 \u00b1 1.036)\nmain sample (1)\nlx (luv ) = (0.639 \u00b1 0.026)luv + (7.026 \u00b1 0.804)\nmain+high-z (2)\nlx (luv ) = (0.648 \u00b1 0.021)luv + (6.734 \u00b1 0.643)\nmain+high-z+Sy 1 (3)\n(the excess precision quoted is useful for plotting purposes). In all cases the fits given above were obtained\nusing the EM algorithm for censored data from ASURV;\nthe Buckley-James method from ASURV returns results\nconsistent within 1\u03c3. The resulting slope is less than one\nin all cases, implying a changing ratio between the 2 keV\nand 2500 \u00c5 monochromatic luminosities with rest-frame\nUV luminosity. The residual scatters around the linear\nrelationships are 0.39, 0.37, and 0.36 (in log units) for\nthe main, main+high-z, and combined samples, respectively (see Table 1). Removing the four AGNs which\nwere targets of ROSAT pointings or the 14 AGNs with\nXMM-Newton/Chandra X-ray photometry, has no material effect on the parameters of the linear regression\nand only slightly decreases the significance of the correlation (on account of the decrease in sample size and\nthe consequent slight increase in the fraction of upper\nlimits when & 10 detections are excluded). In order to\ncheck for any effect of the unidentified HiBALs/LoBALs\nremaining in our sample, we exclude the 9 steepest \u03b1ox\nsources with z < 1.55 from the main sample before performing the correlation. The linear regression parameters for the main sample remain unchanged within the\nquoted errors, with lx = (0.65 \u00b1 0.03)luv + (6.8 \u00b1 1.0).\nSimilarly for the combined sample, assuming a 10% observed HiBAL fraction and taking into account that\nthere are 146 AGNs without C IV coverage, we exclude the 15 steepest \u03b1ox sources with z < 1.55 or\nz > 4.8, before repeating the correlation analysis. We\nfind lx = (0.63 \u00b1 0.02)luv + (7.3 \u00b1 0.6), consistent within\n1\u03c3 with Eqn. 3 above. Removing an additional 10\nSDSS AGNs from the main sample with some UV absorption which do not satisfy the BAL criteria (see\n\u00a7 2.1) also has no effect on the correlation parameters, yielding lx = (0.65 \u00b1 0.04)luv + (6.7 \u00b1 1.1). Constraining the linear regression to the 81 AGNs with\n1.55 < z < 4.80, where BAL AGNs are easy to exclude using the absorption blueward of C IV, we obtain a slightly shallower slope for the lx \u2013luv correlation, lx = (0.58 \u00b1 0.06)luv + (8.8 \u00b1 1.8), consistent with\nEqns. 1\u20133 within 1\u03c3.\nIn order to probe the effects of any dust absorption\nin the rest-frame UV on the lx \u2013luv relation, we use\nthe relative g\u2212i AGN color, \u2206(g \u2212 i). Richards et al.\n(2003a) have shown that a \u2206(g \u2212 i) vs. z diagram,\nlike the one presented in Figure 9, can be used to\ndefine a dust reddened AGN subsample (to the right\nof the dashed line, see their Figure 6). Excluding\nthe 17 AGNs considered dust-reddened according to\nRichards et al. (2003a) definition has no effect on the\nparameters of the lx \u2013luv correlation in the main sample,\nlx = (0.65 \u00b1 0.04)luv + (6.8 \u00b1 1.1).\n3.3. \u03b1ox \u2013 primary dependence on luminosity rather\n\nthan redshift\n\nFig. 9.- Positions of the main-sample AGNs in the relative g\u2212i\ncolor, \u2206(g \u2212 i) vs. redshift diagram. The dashed line represents\nSMC-type reddening as a function of redshift with E(B\u2212V ) = 0.04\nshifted redward by 0.2 to satisfy the Richards et al. (2003a) dustreddening definition. AGNs to the right of the dashed line can\nbe considered to be dust reddened (see Figure 6 of Richards et al.\n2003a). Note that the Lyman limit affects the g magnitudes of the\nfour AGNs with z > 3.1, rendering their relative colors unreliable.\n\nDistributions of \u03b1ox are presented in Figure 10 for the\nmain SDSS (top) and the high-z and Sy 1 (bottom) samples. The main SDSS sample has a median \u03b1ox = \u22121.51,\ncompared to \u03b1ox = \u22121.72 for the high-z sample and\n\u03b1ox = \u22121.34 for the Sy 1 sample. In addition, as can\nbe seen from the numbers on the top of each bin in the\ntop histogram of Figure 10, lower monochromatic luminosity AGNs (luv < 30.5, left number) have flatter \u03b1ox\nindices compared to higher monochromatic luminosity\nAGNs (luv > 30.5, right number). It is therefore apparent that \u03b1ox is correlated with rest-frame monochromatic UV luminosity and/or redshift. We will show below that the primary dependence of \u03b1ox is on rest-frame\nmonochromatic UV luminosity, while the redshift dependence is insignificant.\nFigures 11 and 12 present the \u03b1ox dependence on luv\nand redshift.19 The optical/UV-to-X-ray index \u03b1ox depends primarily on luv with a linear partial correlation\ncoefficient of \u03c412,3 = \u22120.33 (\u03c412,3 = \u22120.30) at a significance level of 10.6\u03c3 (7.4\u03c3) for the combined (main) sample. Table 1 presents the partial correlation statistics\nfor various AGN subsamples. Taking into account that\nthe \u03b1ox \u2013z correlation coefficient changes from negative\n(main and main+high-z samples) to positive (combined\nsample), and that the correlation significance level is always < 1.1\u03c3, our Monte Carlo simulations suggest that\nany apparent correlation could arise by chance due to the\nthird variable (luv ) dependence. To illustrate this using\nthe combined sample, we show in Figure 13 the residuals\n19 The rank correlation analysis used in this paper is more general than linear correlation methods. The \"rank coefficient\" is constructed by comparison of all possible pairs of points, considering\ntheir relative positions rather than exact values. Consequently\nthe correlation results are unaffected by the choice of z instead of\nlog(1 + z) as the independent variable.\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 10.- \u03b1ox distributions for the main SDSS (top), high-z\n(bottom, solid line), and Sy 1 (bottom, dashed line) samples. The\nhatched histograms indicate X-ray upper limits.

The structure of the residuals confirms that an \u03b1ox dependence on\nluv only is adequate to describe the observed variation\nin \u03b1ox , while a redshift dependence alone is inadequate\n(as shown by the systematic residuals). In fact, if we attempt to fit a relation of the form, \u03b1ox = Aluv + Bz + C\nto the combined sample, the result is a fit with B equal\nto zero within the errors. The linear regression fits, taking into account the \u03b1ox upper limits and ignoring any\nredshift dependence, are\n\u03b1ox (luv ) = \u2212(0.136 \u00b1 0.013)luv + (2.630 \u00b1 0.398)\nmain sample (4)\n\u03b1ox (luv ) = \u2212(0.139 \u00b1 0.010)luv + (2.703 \u00b1 0.309)\nmain+high-z (5)\n\u03b1ox (luv ) = \u2212(0.136 \u00b1 0.008)luv + (2.616 \u00b1 0.249)\nmain+high-z+Sy 1 (6)\n(the excess precision quoted is useful for plotting purposes). The residual scatter around the linear relations\nis 0.14 in log units for all samples. The \u03b1ox \u2013luv slopes\nfor all samples are consistent with those inferred from\nthe lx \u2013luv regressions in \u00a7 3.2.\nComparison with previous work is not entirely straightforward, since the sample selections, X-ray detection\nfractions, pattern censoring, and control of other systematics in previous studies differ substantially from\nthose presented here. Wilkes et al. (1994) obtain \u03b1ox \u2013luv\nslopes ranging from \u22120.1 to \u22120.2 for various AGN subsamples, selected from a heterogeneous and incomplete\nsample of 343 AGNs, the majority of which were optically\nselected and observed with Einstein. For a subsample\nof 272 RQ, luv > 29.0 AGNs, Wilkes et al. (1994) find\n\u03b1ox \u221d \u2212(0.15 \u00b1 0.03)luv (see their Figure 14a), which is\nconsistent with Eqns.(4)\u2013(6) above. Green et al. (1995)\nuse a stacking technique to obtain an \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation for\n908 Large Bright Quasar Survey AGNs with RASS cov-\n\nerage, only 10% of which have X-ray detections. Binning\nin luminosity and redshift, and assuming no redshift dependence, they obtain \u03b1ox \u221d \u2212(0.08 \u00b1 0.02)luv, which is\nconsistent with our results within 3\u03c3, but the comparison is inappropriate since their sample includes both RL\nand BAL AGNs. The corresponding slope for the \u03b1ox \u2013luv\nrelation found by VBS03 and updated by Vignali et al.\n(2003) is \u22120.095 \u00b1 0.021 for the SDSS EDR sample, significant at the 3\u20134\u03c3 level. The higher significance of the\n\u03b1ox \u2013luv anti-correlation found in our new sample is a result of the increased monochromatic luminosity and redshift coverage, as well as the increased X-ray detection\nfraction; the 2\u03c3 difference in the \u03b1ox \u2013luv slope is probably\ncaused by the higher fraction of X-ray upper limits in the\nVBS03 sample (\u223c50% in VBS03 and Vignali et al. 2003).\nAside from the higher statistical significance of our current results, we also consider them to be less prone to\nsystematic errors of the type described in \u00a7 1.\nBased on the \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) residuals, we can estimate the maximum possible residual dependence of\n\u03b1ox on redshift and the corresponding maximum possible variation of the ratio of UV-to-X-ray flux, r =\nF\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)/F\u03bd (2 keV). Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator means of the \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) residuals in nine redshift\nbins (see inset plot in the top panel of Figure 13), we\nobtain the weighted linear regression h\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv )i =\n(0.005 \u00b1 0.012)z + (\u22120.010 \u00b1 0.023). The slope is consistent with zero, which again indicates that there is no\nneed for an additional redshift dependence. According\nto the above linear regression, we expect \u03b1ox to vary by\nno more than 0.03 between the redshifts of 0 and 5. By\ndefinition, r = F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5)/F\u03bd (2 keV) = 102.606\u03b1ox , and\ndifferentiating this with respect to \u03b1ox , we have \u03b4r/r =\n2.606(\u03b4\u03b1ox) loge (10) \u2248 6(\u03b4\u03b1ox ) \u2248 0.2, for \u03b4\u03b1ox = 0.03.\nThis implies that the ratio of rest-frame UV-to-X-ray\nflux could only change by .20% with cosmic time from\nz \u2248 0 \u2212 5. Similar analysis applied to the \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (z)\nresiduals (see inset plot in the right panel of Figure 13)\nconfirms that redshift alone cannot be responsible for the\nobserved variation in \u03b1ox . The \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (z) residuals\nshow a systematic variation of \u223c0.2 between monochromatic luminosities luv = 28.5 and luv = 31.8.\nFigure 14 shows the distributions of \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv )\nresiduals, adjusted for the luminosity dependence of \u03b1ox\n(using Eqn. 6), for both the combined sample and a\n1.55 < z < 4.8 subsample (for which all HiBALs can\nbe identified using SDSS spectroscopy). Both distributions have been rescaled to N = 228, the total number\nof AGNs in the combined sample. The slight tendency of\nthe combined-sample distribution towards more negative\n\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) values is probably a result of the \u223c9\u201315\nunidentified BALs which remain in the sample due to\nlack of C IV spectroscopic coverage for z < 1.55 and\nz > 4.8. Proper comparison (i.e., one that takes into\naccount the upper limits) of the two distributions with\nGehan and logrank tests from ASURV shows that they\nare indistinguishable, implying that our combined sample does not contain more than a few percent obscured or\nX-ray weak AGNs. The dotted curve in the top panel of\nFigure 14 is a Gaussian representation of the combinedsample residuals with a mean of 0.017 and a standard\ndeviation of 0.11 (compared to 0.14 obtained from the\nlinear regression of the combined sample). The Gaussian\nparameterization provides a reasonable representation of\n\n\f12\n\nFig. 11.- Top: \u03b1ox dependence on the 2500 \u00c5 monochromatic\nluminosity. The main sample is given with solid circles, the high-z\nsample with open squares, and the Sy 1 sample with open triangles;\narrows in the top panel indicate 2 keV upper limits. The solid line is\nthe linear relation found for the combined sample (Eqn. 6), and the\ndotted line is the corresponding relation from Vignali et al. (2003,\ntheir Eqn. 4). The anti-correlation is significant at the 10.6\u03c3 level\nfor the combined sample. Bottom: Kaplan-Meier estimator of the\nmean \u03b1ox as a function of luv . The numbers at the top indicate\nthe centers of the luv bins and the number of limits vs. the total\nnumber of AGNs in each bin.\n\nthe residuals in both the observed (shown in Figure 14)\nand the binned differential Kaplan-Meier distributions.\nIt is unlikely that we can determine whether a different\nparametric distribution (e.g., a Lorentzian) will provide\na better fit, since the tails of the distribution are uncertain due to the small number of objects. There is no\nevidence of significant skewness of the \u03b1ox distribution,\nafter correction for the luminosity dependence of \u03b1ox . If\na significant number of obscured AGNs remained in our\nsample, we would see an extended leftward tail of the\n\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) residuals (if the absorbed AGNs had Xray detections, as in Figure 1 of Brandt, Laor, & Wills\n2000), or a significant skewness of the distribution if only\n\nFig. 12.- Top: The correlation of \u03b1ox with z is only \u223c1\u03c3\nsignificant if the luv dependence is taken into account (see \u00a7 3.3).\nBottom: Kaplan-Meier estimator of the mean \u03b1ox as a function of\nredshift. Symbols and numbers are as in Figure 11.\n\nupper limits were available for the BAL AGNs. We suspect that the skewness of the \u03b1ox distribution seen by\nAvni & Tananbaum (1986, see their Figure 1, with the xaxis reversed) is a result of the presence of obscured (and\npossibly a larger fraction of RL) AGNs in their sample.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 14 presents the \u03b1ox \u2212 h\u03b1ox i\nresiduals, where h\u03b1ox i = \u22121.514 is the Kaplan-Meier average of the combined sample, assuming no luv and no\nredshift dependence. The broad distribution is a result\nof ignoring the \u03b1ox \u2013luv anti-correlation in a sample with\na large range of luminosities.\nEqns. 4\u20136 show that, within the quoted uncertainties,\nthe same slope and intercept for the \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation are\npresent for the main, main+high-z, and combined samples. As detailed in \u00a7 3.2, these parameter estimates\nare also unaffected by the exclusion of the 14 XMMNewton/Chandra detected AGNs, the four ROSAT targets, the 9\u201315 steepest \u03b1ox AGNs (at the appropriate\nredshifts) to check for any effect of the unidentified Hi-\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 14.- Distributions of the \u03b1ox residuals after adjusting for\nthe luv dependence (top) or the average \u03b1ox (bottom, assuming\nno luv or z dependence). The hatched histogram in the top panel\nrepresents the 228 AGNs from the combined sample; the open histogram represents the 81 AGNs with 1.55 < z < 4.8 (normalized\nto N = 228 for comparison), for which all BAL AGNs can be identified using the SDSS spectroscopy. The dotted Gaussian shown\nin both panels is centered at \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) = 0.017 and has a\nstandard deviation of 0.11. The two numbers on the tops of some\nhistogram bins show the number of AGNs in each bin with X-ray\nlimits in the combined sample (left number) and the 1.55 < z < 4.8\nsubsample (right number, no normalization was applied).\n\nFig. 13.- Single-parameter fit residuals for an \u03b1ox dependence on luv (top) or z (bottom) for the combined sample.\nThe systematic residuals in the right plot support the idea that\nredshift alone cannot be responsible for the observed variation\nin \u03b1ox . Symbols are as in Figure 11. The small inset plots\nin each panel give the Kaplan-Meier estimators of the means\nof the \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) (top) and \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (z) (bottom) residuals in the same redshift and monochromatic luminosity bins\nas in Figures 12 and 11, respectively. The dashed lines in\neach inset plot correspond to the weighted linear regression fits,\nh\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv )i = (0.005 \u00b1 0.012)z + (\u22120.010 \u00b1 0.023) (top) and\nh\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (z)i = (\u22120.039 \u00b1 0.020)luv + (1.184 \u00b1 0.603) (bottom).\n\nBALs, an additional 10 AGNs with some UV absorption, or the 17 AGNs considered dust-reddened by the\nRichards et al. (2003a) criterion. The strength of the\ncorrelations is slightly lower (7.2\u20139.4\u03c3 level for the different samples) if the 14 XMM-Newton/Chandra AGNs\nare excluded, since this decreases the sample size by \u223c7%\nand the detection fraction by \u223c1\u20132%. If we do not correct for the host-galaxy contamination in low-luminosity\nAGNs from the main SDSS sample, Eqn. 4 above would\nhave a somewhat shallower slope of \u22120.128\u00b10.014 and an\nintercept of 2.377 \u00b1 0.417. The effect is in the expected\ndirection (taking into account the artificial increase in\n\nluv and steepening of \u03b1ox for the affected AGNs), and its\nsize (. 1\u03c3) is determined by the fact that only \u223c17% of\nthe 155 SDSS AGNs have host-galaxy correction >5%.\nEven if all Sy 1 AGNs need similar host galaxy corrections, their effect on the \u03b1ox \u2013luv anti-correlation parameters will be equally small, as they represent only 16% of\nthe full sample (37/228).\nFigure 15 presents the \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) residuals of\nthe main SDSS sample vs. the redshift-corrected g\u2212i\ncolor, \u2206(g \u2212 i). Although the redder SDSS AGNs with\n\u2206(g \u2212 i) > 0 appear to be more likely to have \u03b1ox limits rather than detections (partially because they have\nfainter i magnitudes; see Figure 2), no trend of the\nKaplan-Meier estimators of the mean \u03b1ox \u2212\u03b1ox (luv ) residuals is apparent when we bin the data in four \u2206(g\u2212i) bins\n(selected to have equal numbers of objects). A Spearman\ntest on the individual data points returns a correlation\ncoefficient of \u22120.14 with an 8% probability of the null\nhypothesis (no correlation) being correct. We conclude\nthat any dust-reddening dependence of \u03b1ox (in addition\nto the luv dependence) must be weak for the main SDSS\nsample, at least over the \u2206(g \u2212 i) range where we have\nsignificant source statistics.\n3.4. Is the \u03b1ox \u2013l uv Relation Non-linear?\n\nSome studies of optical/UV and X-ray emission from\nAGNs suggest a possible non-linear dependence of\n\u03b1ox on luv (Wilkes et al. 1994; Anderson et al. 2003).\nWilkes et al. (1994) observe that the \u03b1ox \u2013luv correlation\nfound for the Einstein quasar database, \u03b1ox \u221d \u22120.11luv,\nhas a flatter slope, \u03b1ox \u221d \u22120.08luv, if the sample is restricted to low-luminosity objects with luv < 29.5. While\n\n\f14\nIt appears that the slopes are different at the \u223c2\u03c3 level.\nFrom Figure 11, the main SDSS sample has five outlier\npoints at low monochromatic luminosities (with luv < 29\nand \u03b1ox < \u22121.46), which could have influenced the anticorrelation found for luv < 30.5 AGNs. If we exclude\nthose points and repeat the analysis, we obtain slopes of\n\u22120.12 \u00b1 0.02 and \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.02 for the luv < 30.5 and\nluv > 30.5 subsamples, respectively, implying that the\ndifference in slopes is likely an artifact of the addition of\nthe five outlier AGNs rather than demonstrating a real\ndifference. The five outliers are all nearby AGNs, with\nz < 0.22, and most of them are probably X-ray absorbed\nSeyferts. Exclusion of the five outlier AGNs has a 1\u03c3\neffect on the regression parameters in the combined sample, steepening the slope from \u03b1ox \u221d (\u22120.14 \u00b1 0.01)luv to\n\u03b1ox \u221d (\u22120.15 \u00b1 0.01)luv. We conclude that the present\nsample does not offer significant evidence for a non-linear\n\u03b1ox \u2013luv relation.\n3.5. Validating the Slope of the lx \u2013luv Relation\nFig. 15.- Single-parameter fit residuals for an \u03b1ox dependence\non luv (from Eqn. 6) vs. \u2206(g \u2212 i) for the main SDSS sample\n(solid circles). The four z > 3.1 main-sample AGNs with \u2206(g \u2212 i)\nvalues affected by the Lyman limit are excluded. Arrows indicate\nX-ray upper limits. The Kaplan-Meier estimators of the mean\n\u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) in four \u2206(g \u2212 i) bins, given with large filled squares,\nshow that \u03b1ox \u2212 \u03b1ox (luv ) is not strongly correlated with \u2206(g \u2212 i)\nover the range where we have coverage.\n\nthe authors cannot rule out a non-linear relation, they\nsuggest that the difference in slopes is likely caused by\nthe varying host-galaxy contribution to the luv measurement at low redshift (which is accompanied, as expected,\nby a larger scatter in \u03b1ox ). Anderson et al. (2003) also\nreport an observed tendency toward a non-linear \u03b1ox \u2013luv\nrelation (note that they also use the term \"non-linear\"\nto refer to the fact that the slope of the linear lx \u2013luv relation is less than one). The Anderson et al. (2003) sample\ncontains \u223c1158 bright ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS)\nselected AGNs with broad-line SDSS counterparts. This\nsample is not optically selected; in fact it provides Xray fluxes for only \u223c10% of all SDSS AGNs, the majority of which are at low redshifts (z < 1). The goal\nof the Anderson et al. (2003) paper was to present the\nfirst installment of a RASS-SDSS catalog; consequently\nthe presented analysis of the \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation, as stated\nby the authors, was not intended to be conclusive. The\neffects not taken into account include sample selection biases, the statistical method which did not consider thirdvariable dependencies or the effect of unidentified BALs,\nand the effects of the varying dispersions in the optical/UV and X-ray bands (see \u00a7 3.5). To our knowledge,\nthere is presently no conclusive evidence for a non-linear\n\u03b1ox \u2013luv correlation.\nFrom Figure 11, it appears that the \u03b1ox \u2013luv correlation\nmay be non-linear, with a flatter slope for luv . 30.5 and\na steeper one at higher monochromatic luminosities. We\nchecked this by performing linear regressions separately\nfor two subsamples, separated at luv = 30.5. The results\nshown below are based on the main+high-z samples, excluding the Sy 1 sample which is not optically selected;\nthe combined sample gives qualitatively the same results.\nWe obtain a slope of \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.02 for the luv < 30.5 subsample, and \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.02 for the luv > 30.5 subsample.\n\nChanan (1983, C83), La Franca et al. (1995, F95), and\nYuan, Siebert, & Brinkmann (1998, YSB98) explore the\npossibility that the intrinsic lx \u2013luv relation has a slope of\none. They propose that a larger dispersion in the restframe UV (relative to the X-ray) measurements, combined with the steep bright-end UV luminosity function, conspire to produce an lx \u2013luv relation with a slope\nsmaller than one and an apparent \u03b1ox \u2013luv correlation.\nBoth F95 and YSB98 assume Gaussian distributions of\nuncertainties independent of luminosity or redshift for\nlx and luv . They take the observed dispersion around a\nlinear lx \u2013luv relation to be \u223c0.4\u20130.5 in log units, corresponding to a dispersion of 0.15\u20130.2 in the \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation. This is presumably caused by dispersion in the\noptical/UV and X-ray measurements due to measurement error, variability, and intrinsic dispersion (related\nto differences in accretion modes and the conditions in\nthe immediate AGN environment as well as the galaxy\nhost). In order to fit their Einstein data with a linear\nlx \u2013luv relation, F95 require a dispersion in the rest-frame\nmonochromatic UV luminosity of \u03c3uv \u2248 0.34 in log units\n(corresponding to 0.85 mag); the known causes of uncertainty in their sample (i.e., optical/UV photometric\nmeasurement error, assumed constant optical/UV spectral slope, and AGN variability) account for only 0.5 mag.\nThus, the F95 conclusions depend on the assumption\nthat the extra scatter observed around the linear lx \u2013luv\nrelation is due to extra dispersion in the optical/UV.\nYSB98 and Yuan (1999) also assume that the observed\ndispersion in the lx \u2013luv relation is largely due to Gaussian uncertainty in the optical/UV. In the notation of\nYuan (1999), given intrinsic monochromatic luminosities of l\u0304x and l\u0304uv modified by (measurement-error, variability, and intrinsic) scatters of \u03b4lx and \u03b4luv , the observed monochromatic luminosities are lx =  \u0304lx + \u03b4lx and\nluv = l\u0304uv + \u03b4luv . The scatters \u03b4lx and \u03b4luv are assumed to\nbe independent of luminosity and redshift and well represented by Gaussian distributions with zero means and\nstandard deviations of \u03c3x and \u03c3uv . YSB98 and Yuan\n(1999) caution that a spurious \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation could\narise for samples with large optical/UV dispersions (with\noptical/UV-to-X-ray dispersion ratio, R\u03c3 = \u03c3uv /\u03c3x > 1)\nand intrinsic bright monochromatic luminosity limits of\nmax\nl\u0304uv\n= 31.5. In their scenario, the steep bright-end lu-\n\n\f15\nminosity function produces an effective bright luv cutoff, which together with the large optical/UV dispersion distorts the lx \u2013luv distribution, inducing an apparent correlation with slope smaller than one (see Figure 5a\nof YSB98). Assuming a maximum observed monochromax\nmatic luminosity limit of luv\n\u2248 33 (corresponding to\nthe most powerful AGNs found in many surveys), the\nmax\nintrinsic monochromatic luminosity limit  \u0304\nluv\nis fainter\nmax\nmax\nby \u2206luv , i.e., luv\n= l\u0304uv\n+ \u2206luv , with \u2206luv given by\nEqn. B3 of Yuan (1999):\n(\u03b3o \u2212 1)(ln 10)R\u03c32 (2.605\u03c3\u03b1ox )2\n2\n= \u03c3uv\n(\u03b3o \u22121) ln 10.\n1 + R\u03c32\n(7)\nHere \u03c3\u03b1ox is the standard deviation of the observed\ndispersion around the linear \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation and \u03b3o is\nthe slope of the optical luminosity function (\u221d L\u03b3o ,\n\u03b3o = 3 \u2212 4). From Eqn. 7, a large \u03c3uv combined with\na steep bright-end luminosity-function slope (larger \u03b3o )\ncan cause a large difference between the observed and intrinsic maximum monochromatic luminosity (large \u2206luv )\nand bias the lx \u2013luv slope. As defined in Yuan (1999), \u03c3uv\nis related to \u03c3\u03b1ox and R\u03c3 by:\ns\np\n1\n2 + \u03c3 2 = 0.3838 \u03c3\n\u03c3\u03b1ox = 0.3838 \u03c3uv\n(8)\nuv 1 +\nx\nR\u03c32\n\u2206luv =\n\nFor a given observed \u03c3\u03b1ox , larger optical/UV-to-X-ray\ndispersion ratios R\u03c3 are equivalent to a larger fraction of\nthe observed dispersion being attributed to the dispersion in the luv measurement, \u03c3uv , and potentially larger\nbias affecting the the lx \u2013luv correlation. F95, YSB98,\nand Yuan (1999) take the observed \u03c3\u03b1ox , estimate the\ndispersion in the X-ray measurements, and assign the remaining observed dispersion to the rest-frame UV band,\nassuming no intrinsic X-ray dispersion. Since the estimated \u03c3x was typically much less than the observed dispersion around the linear \u03b1ox \u2013luv fit, R\u03c3 > 1 (see Eqn. 8)\ngives rise to an lx \u2013luv correlation with slope less than one\nand an apparent \u03b1ox \u2013luv correlation. In the following\nsubsections we consider the sources of dispersion in both\nthe rest-frame UV and X-ray monochromatic luminosities and confirm that the lx \u2013luv correlation has a slope\nof \u223c0.65 for all realistic R\u03c3 values in our sample.\n3.5.1. Dispersion of the lx and luv measurements\n\nThe dispersions of the lx and luv estimates, assuming\nno intrinsic dispersion, i.e., luv = Alx + C, where A and\nC are constants independent of monochromatic luminosity or redshift, can be attributed to measurement errors\nand AGN variability. AGN variability is a function of\nboth wavelength and AGN luminosity, and it affects our\nresults since the optical/UV and X-ray observations are\nnot simultaneous. For our sample, the ROSAT observations were taken between 1991 and 1993, the Chandra\nand XMM-Newton observations between 2000 and 2002,\nand the SDSS observations between 2000 and 2003; the\ntimescales of interest are thus of order 0\u201312 years (corresponding to rest-frame time lags of 0\u201312 years). The\noptical/UV variability structure function of AGNs shows\nsigns of flattening for time lags of > 5 years, at a value\nof \u223c0.3 mag for measurements at 2500 \u00c5 of a typical\nSDSS AGN with an absolute i-band magnitude Mi \u223c\u221225\n(Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2004; Vanden Berk et al. 2004a). A 2500 \u00c5\n\nvariability amplitude of 0.3 mag corresponds to \u223c30%\nuncertainty in F\u03bd (2500 \u00c5) and Luv , and \u223c4% uncertainty\nin \u03b1ox . The measurement uncertainties in the rest-frame\nUV are typically \u223c10%, but could be as large as 25%\nfor about one-quarter of the main sample, as discussed\nin \u00a7 2.1. If we weight the measurement uncertainties by\nthe number of AGNs affected, we arrive at an average\nrest-frame UV measurement error of \u223c14%. Adding the\nuncertainties due to variability and measurement error\nin quadrature, we expect \u03b4Luv \u223c 33% (\u03b4luv \u223c 0.17 in log\nunits).\nThe X-ray flux measurements are considerably less\ncertain, with typical measurement errors of 30% (&10\u2013\n40% for \u221214 < log(F0.5\u20132 keV ) < \u221213). On short\ntimescales more luminous AGNs have smaller X-ray\nvariability amplitudes (e.g., Green, McHardy, & Lehto\n1993), but all AGNs have comparable amplitude variations on the longer timescales (of order years) of\ninterest to us. Longer timescale variability studies of\nSeyfert 1s reveal variability of &100% of the mean\ncount rate in some sources, with no obvious difference\nin the variability amplitude between higher and lower\nluminosity AGNs (Uttley, McHardy, & Papadakis 2002;\nUttley & McHardy 2004, and references therein). Typical long-term root mean square (rms) variability of\nSeyfert 1s is 20\u201340% (Grupe, Thomas, & Beuermann\n2001;\nUttley, McHardy, & Papadakis\n2002;\nMarkowitz, Edelson, & Vaughan 2003).\nAssuming\nthe long-term variability is the same in luminous AGNs\n(\u223c30%), and combining the uncertainties due to variability and measurement errors, we arrive at an average\nuncertainty of \u03b4Lx \u223c 42% (\u03b4lx \u223c 0.23 in log units) for\nour X-ray measurements.\nTaking into account only the measurement errors and\nvariability effects on the lx and luv estimates, we infer X-ray and optical/UV uncertainties (in log units)\nof \u03c3x > 0.23 and \u03c3uv < 0.17, respectively. Combining\nthe above estimates, we arrive at an expected dispersion\nof \u223c0.29. The observed dispersion varies between 0.35\nand 0.39 for our combined and main samples, implying\nthat, unless we are underestimating the uncertainty due\nto measurement error and/or variability, there is an extra source of dispersion roughly equal in magnitude to\nthe one we can account for that is perhaps intrinsic to\nthe AGN energy generation mechanism.\n3.5.2. Effect of the lx and luv uncertainties on the\n\nmeasured relations\nIn the previous section we estimated the dispersions in\nthe lx and luv measurements considering measurement\nerrors and AGN variability. Here we use Monte Carlo\nsimulations of mock samples to assess the validity of the\nsample correlations in the presence of large dispersion\nin the rest-frame UV relative to the X-ray band. From\n\u00a7 3.5.1, \u03c3x \u223c 0.23, and the observed dispersion in \u03b1ox for\nthe main sample is \u03c3\u03b1ox = 0.15. Even if all the extra dispersion in \u03b1ox comes from the rest-frame UV, \u03c3uv < 0.31\nand R\u03c3 < 1.4 (in log units log(R\u03c3 ) < 0.15). We simulated 100 samples similar to the main, main+high-z, and\ncombined samples (equal numbers of objects with the\nsame rest-frame UV monochromatic luminosity distribution and equal numbers of X-ray limits) for each of 21\ndifferent R\u03c3 values, equally spaced in log units between\nlog(R\u03c3 ) = \u22121 and log(R\u03c3 ) = 1. For each R\u03c3 , we com-\n\n\f16\nputed the average slopes of the lx \u2013luv and \u03b1ox \u2013luv correlations from the 100 mock samples of each of our three\nsubsamples (mock-main, mock-main+high-z, and mockcombined) and display the results in Figure 16. None of\nthe ratios of optical/UV-to-X-ray dispersion considered\nhere can produce an apparent \u03b1ox relation or a lx \u2013luv\nrelation with slopes equal to those observed in the main,\nthe main+high-z, or the combined samples with > 99%\nconfidence (> 4\u03c3). Our sample estimates indicate that\nlog(R\u03c3 ) < 0.15, which only increases the significance of\nthis comparison. Larger optical/UV-to-X-ray dispersion\nratios than the one considered here are unrealistic, and\nthus we conclude that the correlations found in this paper are not apparent correlations caused by the steep\nbright end of the optical/UV luminosity function and a\nlarge dispersion in the optical/UV relative to the X-rays.\n4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe SDSS is providing one of the largest optically\nselected AGN samples to date with substantially better photometry and higher completeness than previous\nwell-studied optical color selected samples like the BQS\nsample. Various studies have found that the bright B\nband selection limit (B < 16.16) and blue U \u2212 B cut\n(U \u2212 B < \u22120.44) of the BQS sample bias the sample\ntowards z < 0.5 and the bluest luminous AGNs, systematically excluding redder objects, while including some\nAGNs fainter than the quoted magnitude limit (e.g.,\nWampler & Ponz 1985; Wisotzki et al. 2000; Jester et al.\n2005). SDSS uses 4-dimensional redshift-dependent color\nselection and flux limits the AGN sample in the i-band\n(with an effective wavelength of 7481 \u00c5 compared to\n4400 \u00c5 for the BQS sample's B band), which, together\nwith the accurate CCD photometry, creates a highly\ncomplete, representative sample of optical AGNs.\nWe have selected a representative sample of 155 radioquiet SDSS AGNs from DR2, serendipitously observed\nin medium-deep ROSAT pointings, creating an unbiased sample with sensitive coverage in the rest-frame UV,\n20 cm radio, and soft X-ray bands. Using the serendipitous ROSAT observations of SDSS AGNs supplemented\nby 36 high-redshift luminous QSOs and 37 Seyfert 1\ngalaxies, we consider the relations between rest-frame\nUV (measured at 2500 \u00c5) and X-ray (at 2 keV) emission in a combined sample of 228 AGNs with an X-ray\ndetection fraction of 86%. We have carefully dealt with\na variety of selection and analysis issues, ranging from\nthe appropriateness of the sample to the suitability of\nthe statistical methods. The removal of RL and BAL\nAGNs is essential if we want to study the intrinsic relations between UV and X-ray energy generation in the\ntypical luminous AGN, as it restricts the confusing effects\nof jet emission and X-ray absorption. To the extent that\nwe can measure them, BAL AGNs have the same underlying X-ray emission properties as normal RQ AGNs\n(e.g., Gallagher et al. 2002), but they remain hidden by\nstrong absorption. Consequently we take special care to\nremove all known BALs from our sample and to consider\nthe effects of unidentified BAL AGNs in specific redshift\nranges.\nWe find that the monochromatic luminosity at 2500 \u00c5\nand 2 keV are correlated (at the 11.5\u03c3 level), independent of their strong correlations with redshift. This correlation cannot be caused by the steep fall-off of the\n\nFig. 16.- Slopes of the apparent \u03b1ox -luv anti-correlation\n(top) and the lx -luv correlation (bottom) as a function of the\noptical/UV-to-X-ray dispersion ratio, R\u03c3 , from simulated samples\nsimilar to the main SDSS sample (solid circles), the main+high-z\nsamples (solid squares), and the combined sample (open squares).\nEach point represents the average slope obtained from 100 simulated samples, equally spaced in log(R\u03c3 ); the squares have been\ndisplaced by \u00b10.01 from the true log(R\u03c3 ) values for clarity. The\nhatched regions represent the 1\u03c3 ranges measured in the main\nSDSS sample (right-slanted), the main+high-z samples (vertical\nlines), and the combined sample (left-slanted).\n\nbright AGN number-density combined with a large ratio\nof optical/UV-to-X-ray dispersion in our sample as suggested by C83, F95, YSB98, and Yuan (1999). We take\nspecial care when evaluating the statistical significance of\npartial correlations in censored datasets. Using the partial Kendall's \u03c412,3 and the EM linear regression method\nin an optically selected sample with a wide range of AGN\nluminosities and redshifts and a large X-ray detection\nfraction, we can properly assess the significance and estimate the parameters of the correlations. In addition, we\nuse Monte Carlo realizations of mock relations in simulated samples to establish the applicability of the above\nmethods. We confirm that the slope of the lx \u2013luv corre-\n\n\f17\nlation is less than one (\u223c0.65), implying a dependence of\nthe optical/UV-to-X-ray index, \u03b1ox , on monochromatic\nluminosity and/or redshift. We find that \u03b1ox is primarily\ndependent on rest-frame monochromatic UV luminosity\n(at the 7.4\u201310.6\u03c3 level), while any redshift dependence\nis insignificant (. 1.1\u03c3).\nThe \u03b1ox \u2013luv anti-correlation implies that AGNs redistribute their energy in the UV and X-ray bands\ndepending on overall luminosity, with more luminous\nAGNs emitting fewer X-rays per unit UV luminosity\nthan less luminous AGNs. Currently, no self-consistent\ntheoretical study is able to explain from first principles why \u03b1ox should be in the observed range, much\nless predict its variation with luv . Theoretical studies\nof Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) disks give predictions of\nthe rest-frame UV emission but cannot predict the Xray emission, which is believed to originate in a hot\ncoronal gas of unknown geometry and disk-covering fraction. Recent advances in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks (e.g., Balbus & Hawley 1998,\nand references therein) offer the promise of a selfconsistent disk+corona model of AGN emission. In such\na model, the dissipation of magnetic fields, arising from\nthe magneto-rotational instability deep in the accretion\ndisk, could heat the coronal gas to X-ray emitting temperatures (J. H. Krolik 2004, private communication; see\nalso Krolik 1999). Our empirical relation between restframe UV and soft-X-ray emission in AGNs and the \u03b1ox \u2013\nluv anti-correlation provide the best constraints yet that\nfuture self-consistent disk+corona models must explain.\nThe observed lack of redshift dependence of \u03b1ox at\nfixed luminosity provides evidence for the remarkable\nconstancy of the accretion process in the immediate\nvicinity of the black hole, despite the dramatic changes\nof AGN hosts and the strong evolution of AGN number densities over the history of the Universe. The sample used here provides no evidence for non-linearities in\nthe \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation. The dispersions observed around\nthe lx \u2013luv and \u03b1ox \u2013luv relations cannot be accounted for\nby measurement errors and AGN variability alone, suggesting that black-hole mass, accretion rate, and/or spin\n(and the corresponding differences in accretion modes,\nenergy generation mechanisms, and feedback) could be\ncontributing to the observed dispersion.\nOur results are qualitatively consistent with\nprevious studies (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum 1986;\nVignali, Brandt, & Schneider 2003), but the new results\nare quantitatively better since they are based on a large,\nhighly complete sample with medium-deep soft X-ray\ncoverage and carefully controlled systematic biases.\nAlthough larger samples of optically selected AGNs with\nX-ray coverage can be constructed (e.g., Wilkes et al.\n1994; Green et al. 1995; Anderson et al. 2003), the\nexisting survival analysis tools cannot guarantee an\naccurate recovery of the intrinsic rest-frame UV to\nX-ray relations based on pattern censored data with\nshallow X-ray coverage and low X-ray detection fraction.\nStacking analysis can be used on optical AGNs with\nshallow X-ray coverage (e.g., Green et al. 1995), but this\nmethod provides only mean values, without constraining\nthe spread in each bin. In addition, stacking analyses\ndone to date have not always allowed for binning in\nGalactic Hydrogen column densities, redshifts, radioloudness, and strong UV-absorption. The lx \u2013luv relation\n\npresented here can be used to predict more accurately\nthe intrinsic X-ray fluxes of AGNs with known optical/UV luminosity and serves to define the \"normal\"\nrange of soft X-ray emission for a typical AGN (i.e., RQ,\nnon-BAL AGNs, unaffected by absorption). Based on\nthis definition of normal X-ray emission, it is easier to\ndetermine if a \"special\" class of AGNs differs in its X-ray\nproperties from normal AGNs. X-ray \"weak\" AGNs are\nan example of such a special AGN class. Risaliti et al.\n(2003) used the BQS sample to define normal AGNs,\nand suggested that some AGNs in the Hamburg Quasar\nSurvey (HQS, Hagen et al. 1995) are X-ray weaker in\ncomparison.\nHowever, Brandt, Schneider, & Vignali\n(2004) caution that since the HQS AGNs are among\nthe most luminous objects in the rest-frame UV, the\nobserved steep \u03b1ox values are expected based on the\n\u03b1ox \u2013luv anti-correlation for about half of the objects\n(see their Figure 3). Our more accurate prediction of\nthe optical/UV-to-X-ray emission of normal AGN will\nalso allow researchers to constrain the X-ray emission\nassociated with jets in RL AGNs (assuming that AGN\njets do not contribute to the emission at 2500 \u00c5, but\nsee Baker & Hunstead 1995; Baker et al. 1995; Cheung\n2002) and to study the X-ray properties of other special\nAGNs; e.g, red AGNs, AGNs without emission lines, or\nAGNs with unusual emission lines (e.g., Gallagher et al.\n2005). The \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation of normal AGNs presented\nin this paper can also lead to more accurate estimates of\nthe bolometric luminosities of AGNs, resulting in tighter\nconstraints on the importance of AGN-phase mass\naccretion for the growth of supermassive black holes as\ndescribed in, e.g., Marconi et al. (2004). Assuming the\nElvis et al. (1994) spectral energy distribution (SED)\nand \u22121.7 < \u03b1ox < \u22121.26 (where the majority of our\noptically selected RQ non-absorbed AGNs lie; see Figure 11) together with the \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation from Eqn. 6,\nwe estimate that the ratio of the 0.5\u20132.0 keV luminosity\nto the bolometric luminosity varies by a factor of 6\u20139\nover the luminosity range luv = 28.5 \u2212 31.8 (depending\non the inclusion or exclusion of the infrared bump in the\ncomputation of the bolometric luminosity). If neglected,\nthe variation of the bolometric correction with AGN\nluminosity could lead to substantial systematic errors in\nbolometric luminosity estimates.\nFuture SDSS data releases will allow the enlargement\nof the optical/UV/soft-X-ray sample of AGNs, as well\nas provide large new samples of optically selected AGNs\nserendipitously observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra, as the sky-coverage of X-ray satellites increases with\ntime. Larger samples will include more homogeneous\nlow-luminosity AGN data, providing more sensitive constraints on the non-linearity of the \u03b1ox \u2013luv relation. In\naddition, longer-wavelength optical/UV monochromatic\nflux estimates would complement the rest-frame UV measurements at 2500 \u00c5 used here, to minimize any effects\nof dust absorption in the UV on the lx \u2013luv relation (e.g.,\nGaskell et al. 2003, but see also Hopkins et al. 2004). The\nextension to samples observed in harder X-ray bands is\nalso necessary to constrain the possible effects of softX-ray absorption better. This can be achieved by considering an \u03b1ox index computed using rest-frame \u22485 keV\ninstead of 2 keV X-ray monochromatic fluxes.\nHasinger (2004) reports that X-ray selected AGN sam-\n\n\f18\nples have lx \u2013luv correlations consistent with a slope of one\nand no \u03b1ox dependence on either luminosity or redshift.\nCurrent X-ray selected samples with optical identifications are large and cover wide ranges of optical/UV and\nX-ray luminosity, but they seldom constrain the optical/UV absorption, radio loudness, or host-galaxy contribution of the sources. In addition, some X-ray selected\nsamples are biased toward particular optical AGN types\n(e.g., narrow-line Seyfert 1s in bright soft X-ray samples;\nGrupe et al. 2004) and could contain a larger fraction of\nabsorbed AGNs. More studies are necessary to reconcile the results obtained for optically color-selected and\nX-ray selected samples, taking into account the sample\nselection effects in flux limited samples introduced by the\noptical/UV and X-ray AGN population number density\nand luminosity evolution with cosmic time.\nFirmly establishing the correlation between rest-frame\nUV and X-ray emission in AGNs is the first step toward\nunderstanding their generation mechanisms and interrelations. A reasonable next step is to try to relate the\ncorrelations found here to reasonable estimates of blackhole masses and accretion rates. The difficulty in this\nendeavor lies in the fact that direct black-hole mass measurements and bolometric luminosity estimates are not\navailable for large AGN samples like those considered\nhere. Indirect black-hole mass measurements can be obtained from a combination of monochromatic luminosity\nand broad emission-line width measurements as shown\nfor BQS sample AGNs by Kaspi et al. (2000) and SDSS\nAGNs by McLure & Dunlop (2004). Such estimates,\nhowever, will depend on the extrapolation of Kaspi et al.\n(2000) relation from lower (\u03bbL\u03bb (5100 \u00c5) . 2 \u00d7 1045 , corresponding to luv . 30.3) to higher (\u03bbL\u03bb (5100 \u00c5) &\n2 \u00d7 1045 ) luminosity AGNs, the use of different emission lines at different redshifts (e.g., H\u03b2 and Mg II for\nthe SDSS sample presented here), as well as a non-trivial\ncorrection for the effects of the host-galaxy, giving rise to\npossible systematic errors. We are currently investigating the feasibility of this endeavor for the SDSS sample\npresented here.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.
