The first effort was his masterful study of\nthe effect on the Dirac electron vacuum of the choice of chiral boundary condition on the\nelectron wave function at the location of a Dirac monopole [1]. This problem can be viewed\nas an appropriate limit of the case of Dirac isospinor fermions interacting with an 't HooftPolyakov monopole, in which one member of the isospinor doublet becomes extremely light.\nHe showed that there is a fractional electric charge at the monopole (i.e., dyon charge), in\nthe form of a polarization charge of the electron vacuum. Thus the boundary condition in\nthis context expresses the vacuum angle earlier shown by Witten to imply fractional dyon\ncharge in a theory without fermions [2].1\nAn equally remarkable and original contribution was Yamagishi's introduction, in the\ncontext of solitons in one space and one time dimension, of the concept of local quantum\nenergy density [3]. He was led to investigate this subject by the fact that different calculations\nof the quantum energy for a soliton in N = 1 supersymmetric theory gave different results,\nboth zero and nonzero. He realized that there could be energies associated with the choice of\nboundary conditions on the wave functions for field oscillations, governing their behavior at\nthe edges of a large region containing the soliton. Computing local densities would eliminate\nthis ambiguity, because those contingent boundary energies would be localized far from the\nsoliton center.\nYamagishi recognized the necessity of proper renormalization of the quantum perturbation theory for obtaining correct results, and described how to do this renormalization and\nmake the resulting calculation systematic. His conclusion was that there is a nontrivial local\nenergy density in the examples he studied, but that the integrated energy density vanishes.\nThis conclusion had considerable appeal, because it implemented an identity between the\nenergy and the central charge (whose quantum correction was expected to vanish [4, 5]).\nIndeed Yamagishi calculated also the local central charge density, verifying the equality of\nthe two integrated densities. The aforementioned equality arises because in such theories, of\nthe two supersymmetry generators (corresponding to the two components of a fermion wave\nfunction), one remains unbroken even in the presence of the soliton. The difference between\nenergy and central charge is proportional to the norm of a state generated by action of a\nsupersymmetry operator on the soliton ground state. Thus, if one such operator is unbroken,\ni.e., annihilates the ground state, the equality holds.\nWell over a decade passed after this work, during which there was little further development towards consensus on the correct value of the quantum mass correction for solitons in\nsuch 2D supersymmetric theories. The next stage began when Rebhan and van Nieuwenhuizen [RV] realized that a naive energy cutoff used in much of the susy kink literature was\ninconsistent with other, more carefully defined regularization methods. They used mode\nnumber regularization (described below) to compute the total quantum correction for a\nsupersymmetric kink with periodic boundary conditions on the fermion as well as boson\n1\n\nYamagishi's analysis contained as a special case the known fact that in the presence of strictly massless\nfermions chiral rotation undoes the effect of vacuum angle, so that the latter becomes unobservable.\nAlso, in light of the main topic of the present work, it is worth noting that Yamagishi computed the\n(logarithmically divergent) energy associated with the boundary condition.\n\n\f4\nfluctuation wave functions [6].2 Of course, this nonzero result, differing from some prior\nresults, was open to the objection that it might include a boundary energy contribution.\nNot long after, the same two authors joined by Nastase and Stephanov [NRSV] imposed\n'natural' or 'invisible' boundary conditions on the fermion wave functions both in the trivial\nor vacuum background and in the kink background (so that there could be no extra energy\nlocalized near the boundary), and reproduced one of the finite answers from the earlier period [8]. Graham and Jaffe [GJ] did a calculation in terms of scattering phase shifts, with\nno explicit dependence on boundary conditions, and obtained the same result [9].\nWhile this new activity agreed with the result first found by Schonfeld in his consideration\nof a kink-antikink system with the two objects well separated [10], a complete understanding\nrequired reconciliation of the global result with the local calculation of Yamagishi. Shifman,\nVainshtein, and Voloshin [SVV] [11], stimulated by the work of the Stony Brook\u2013Vienna\ngroup, decided to tackle the question head-on by returning to the calculation of the local\ncentral charge density pioneered by Yamagishi. They identified an ambiguity hidden in the\nearlier work. Yamagishi had been explicit in his computation of renormalization effects, but\nhad not discussed explicitly the other 'r' required for a one loop calculation: regularization.\nThe point here, which Yamagishi clearly understood, is that in calculating an energy sum\none must subtract from the sum in the presence of the soliton the equally (quadratically)\ndivergent sum in a flat, or vacuum background.3 The subtracted quantity is only logarithmically divergent, and that is the divergence compensated by renormalization. Given the\nregularization scheme, one still has to fix the finite parts in the renormalization by suitable renormalization conditions. Lacking an explicit regularization scheme (possibly he had\nsimple energy cutoff in mind), Yamagishi was not in a position to determine uniquely the\nfinite part of the renormalization. By implementing higher-derivative regularization for the\ncentral charge density, SVV were able to accomplish this while explicitly maintaining supersymmetry. They obtained a nonzero integrated correction to the central charge, precisely\nequal to the energy shift previously calculated by Schonfeld, as well as NRSV and GJ.\nThus the equality of mass and central charge which Yamagishi had found was preserved,\nbut both quantities were shifted from zero by an extra finite piece which was not expected.\nNRSV, on the basis of their nonzero result for the quantum correction to the energy, suspected the existence of an anomaly, given the naive expectation that the quantum correction\nto the central charge should vanish. GJ did not discuss anomalies at all, but did notice that\nthe terms corresponding to each state in the unregulated, unrenormalized energy-density\nsum are equal one to one with the corresponding terms in the central charge density. They\naccomplished regulation and renormalization for energy by subtracting from the divergent\nsum the divergent contribution from the first Born approximation to the phase shift, and\nin the case of fermions also the divergent part of the second Born approximation. They\njustified this choice by noting that the no-tadpole condition in the trivial sector requires a\ncounterterm for the soliton mass which is precisely equal to the integral over momentum of\nthe contribution from the subtracted divergent phase shifts. They took the momentum cut2\n\n3\n\nThey made this choice of boundary conditions following the original work for a kink in purely bosonic\ntheory by Dashen, Hasslacher, and Neveu [DHN] [7]. Amusingly, in the bosonic theory, the choice of\nboundary conditions makes no difference to the result.\nActually in the supersymmetric system the quadratic divergence in the trivial sector cancels between\nbosons and fermions, but this just replaces the previous regulation problem by one of correctly matching\nthe energy sums for the bosons and fermions in the kink sector.\n\n\f5\noff used to define the counterterm equal to the momentum cutoff in the sum over momenta\nof contributions from continuum states to the energy shift. Having already determined the\ncounterterm (using naive energy cutoff), by this choice they implicitly defined a regularization scheme. To implement the equality of central charge with energy, they used the identical\nsubtraction to define central charge as they had used for energy. This certainly was consistent, but it left open the question whether and if so where an anomalous contribution to the\ncentral charge might be identified, as is remarked at the end of the paper of SVV. In any\ncase, what remained to be demonstrated was that one could deduce the regularization and\nrenormalization of the central charge directly by analyzing its field-theoretic structure. SVV\ndid exactly that, showing explicitly that there is an anomaly, which preserves supersymmetry by providing a shift in the central charge equal to that in the energy. Like the famous\nchiral anomaly this one is an automatic consequence of using a regularization scheme that\npreserves a relevant symmetry, in the present case supersymmetry.\nIn an important respect the line of development begun by Yamagishi still was incomplete,\nbecause the local energy density corresponding to the established global energy and local\ncentral charge density was not computed directly. That was accomplished by Goldhaber,\nLitvintsev, and van Nieuwenhuizen [GLV2] [12] and independently by Wimmer [13]. They\ndemonstrated by explicit checks the validity of a local regularization scheme called local\nmode regularization. This scheme makes computation of energy density of a soliton in 2D\ntheory very clear and simple. Not surprisingly, it confirms directly for the supersymmetric\nkink the equality of energy density and central charge density proposed by Yamagishi and\ndemonstrated by SVV. At the same time, local energy density is an interesting quantity in\nnon-supersymmetric theories, where the definition of central charge is not clear.\nEven with the above results, there remains an open frontier in the computation of quantum energy densities, especially in the direction of higher dimensions. Clearly, the tree of\nlocal energy determination which Hidenaga Yamagishi planted continues to grow and bear\nfruit, a tribute to his insight and originality.\nIn section II we focus on a development which was essential to the new understanding\nof local energy and central charge densities, namely, the careful regularization by the older,\nglobal methods of the total mass of a soliton, as discussed in GLV1 [14]. This discussion is followed by an explicit demonstration of the universal equivalence, in results for the anomalous\nor high-energy contribution to quantum energy of a field in the presence of some background\npotential, between higher-derivative regularization and local mode regularization.\nIn section III and IV, we describe some recent work in (slightly) higher dimensions. We\nbegin by embedding the supersymmetric kink as a domain wall in 2+1 dimensions and use\nthis to set up a supersymmetry-preserving dimensional regularization scheme. This allows\nus to derive the anomaly in the central charge in a particularly transparent manner, which is\nfound to be made possible by parity violation and a corresponding nonvanishing expectation\nvalue for the momentum operator in the extra dimension. In section IV we apply this method\nto the supersymmetric abelian vortex 2+1 dimension and determine its quantum corrections\nto mass and central charge.\n\n\f6\nII.\nA.\n\nSOLITONS IN 1+1 DIMENSIONS\n\nFermion zero modes in global mode regularization\n\nOne method of regularization, utilized by DHN in their investigation of the quantum\ncorrection to the mass of a kink or a sine-Gordon soliton in a purely bosonic theory, is called\nmode number regularization. There is a very concrete picture behind this scheme. Imagine\nintroducing, in what initially is vacuum, some background potential which influences the\nmotion of a fermion obeying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Suppose further that at the start\none had a free Fermi sea filled to some level, so that all possible states up to a maximum\nnumber N were occupied. Then, provided the boundary conditions on the wave functions at\nlarge positive and negative values of the spatial coordinate x prevent any probability leakage\nthrough the boundaries, the total number N will not change when the potential is introduced.\nFurther, if the Fermi level is high enough compared to the magnitude of the potential, then\nthere will be no level crossings near that level as the potential is gradually altered. Thus, just\nas before the potential was introduced, the first N states will be filled, though the maximum\nenergy may be changed slightly, and the low-energy spectrum may be altered dramatically,\nfor example, to include bound states. To find the regulated quantum shift in energy one\nmay subtract the sums of energies of the first N states with and without the potential\npresent. The net sum might still be divergent with N, in which case renormalization would\nbe required as well, but in any case the effect of this regularization would be well defined.\nOne now can adopt the same maneuver for a relativistic Bose field in the presence of a\npotential. Before the potential is introduced, one uses an energy regularization to say that\nall solutions of the wave equation up to a maximum energy \u01ebmax are counted. There are N\npairs of these solutions, each pair with one positive and one (equal) negative frequency. After\nintroducing the potential, we again require N pairs of solutions, and those solutions are all\nthe ones having energy \u01eb\u2032i \u2264 \u01eb\u2032max (N). Thus we find a regulated, but not yet renormalized,\nenergy,\nN\n1X \u2032\nEreg =\n(\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebi ) ,\n(1)\n2 i=1 i\nwhere the factor 21 is the familiar coefficient in the zero-point energy contribution of each\nmode.\nA subtlety arises in this calculation if the presence of a potential happens to introduce a\nzero-frequency solution, which would occur either accidentally or as a result of some particular symmetry obeyed by the potential. For example, if the potential for Bose fluctuations\narises from the presence of a nontrivial classical soliton solution of the equations of motion of\nthe Bose field, then there is clearly a zero frequency deformation corresponding to uniform\ntranslation of the soliton. As mentioned above, solutions of (equal) positive and negative\nfrequency come in pairs, and one pair defines one state. At zero frequency there is also\none state, because the 'momentum' conjugate to the Bose field for the translation solution\nbecomes the momentum of the soliton moving with some definite velocity. Each pair of\nsolutions of the bosonic field equations (including any at zero frequency) corresponds to one\nterm in (1).\nFor fermions the situation is less familiar. Again, there are paired positive and negative\nfrequency solutions, each corresponding to a term in (1). However, if there is only one zero\nenergy solution of the fermionic fluctuation equations, this does not correspond to a term\n\n\f7\nin (1). The coefficient of this solution in the expansion of the Fermi field is an operator c0\nsatisfying c20 = 1, and that c0 appears in the expression for one of the two supersymmetry\noperators (the one that does not annihilate the soliton ground state). Several remarkable\nfacts follow from these observations. First, such a wave function does not correspond to\na zero mode of the soliton, because any mode requires two independent, noncommuting\nnilpotent creation and annihilation operators, and here one has instead one hermitean,\nidempotent operator (which may be represented as a Pauli \u03c3 matrix). This immediately\nintroduces a serious difficulty for the standard recipe of mode regularization, because the\nspectrum of nonnegative frequency solutions no longer is in one-to-one correspondence with\nthe number of terms in (1). Secondly, because the one supersymmetry operator associated\nwith the zero-frequency solution does not annihilate the soliton ground state, it follows that\nthe ground state spontaneously breaks supersymmetry.\nThere is another remarkable aspect of this phenomenon. The ground state not only is\nnot annihilated by a supersymmetry operator, but becomes an eigenstate of that operator,\nif one decomposes the kink vacua |Ki and c0 |Ki into \u221a12 (1 + c0 )|Ki and \u221a12 (1 \u2212 c0 )|Ki [15].\nThis is remarkable because there is a discrete Z2 operator which takes the Fermi field into its\nnegative, and which in other contexts could be used to prove that one cannot build a coherent\nsuperposition of a boson and a fermion. Now we find that an operator anticommuting with\nthis Z2 operator leaves the ground state unchanged. Therefore two states with equal and\nopposite eigenvalues for the supersymmetry generator must be identified. In other words,\nthe Hilbert space splits into two noncommunicating parts, which are gauge copies of each\nother [14]. This is a discrete analogue to the Higgs mechanism, in which a continuous local\ngauge symmetry is hidden because a scalar field in a nontrivial representation of that gauge\nsymmetry has a nonzero expectation value.\nSomething not considered in GLV1 is the generalization of this discussion about the Z2\ngauge symmetry to the case of many solitons, which would be relevant for sine-Gordon\nsolitons if not for the kink (the focus of that study).4 The Z2 symmetry is not a local\ngauge symmetry, so that for a multisoliton system the relative signs of eigenvalues of the\nsupersymmetry operator acting on different solitons might be significant. This may be\nrelated to a discovery of Moore and Read long before, in a 2+1-dimensional system which\nappears to describe the 5/2 state of the fractional quantum Hall effect [16]. They discussed\n'nonabelian statistics' for objects carrying electric charge \u2213e/4. This kind of statistics seems\nto us interpretable in terms of the eigenvalues of the supersymmetry operator, which would\nreverse sign when one such object made a full circle around another. Specifically, for a\nsystem with n solitons separated from each other by a finite distance, charge conjugation\nsymmetry guarantees [n/2] pairs of equal positive and negative frequency solutions, and for\nodd n one zero frequency solution. To each of the paired solutions corresponds a fermion\ncreation operator, and hence there are 2[n/2] nearly degenerate states of the n-soliton system.\nFor infinite separation, there are n operators c0 which each have equal positive and negative\neigenvalues. Superficially this might imply 2n distinct states, but as we already have argued\nthere is a gauge redundancy which reduces this number. The calculation for finite separation\nshows that the reduction must bring that number down to 2[n/2] .\nWhile these ideas are surprising and beautiful, one would like to have a clear idea what\nhas happened to the principle of mode number regularization, now that the counting of\n4\n\nBecause a kink cannot be adjacent to another kink, pure multi-kink systems, with no anti-kinks, are not\npossible.\n\n\f8\nfermion modes suddenly has a lacuna. GLV1 found two different ways to deal with this\nquestion. First, following NRSV, one may use locally invisible (periodic or antiperiodic)\nboundary conditions in vacuum, and locally invisible (twisted periodic (TP) or twisted\nantiperiodic (TAP), where the twist refers to a chiral rotation of a wave function by \u03c0/2 at\nthe one boundary with respect to that at the other) conditions in the presence of a kink.\nNow an assumption necessary to derive the equality of numbers of modes before and after\nthe background is introduced no longer holds, because the twisting at the boundary allows\n'leakage' of mode number at the boundary. This is a concept that goes back to an article\nof Goldstone and Wilczek describing adiabatic flow of fermion number out of a magnetic\nmonopole as the Yukawa coupling of the fermions to a Higgs field is chirally rotated [17].\nIn their discussion the leakage is out to infinity rather than into the boundary. The final\nresult for localized charge is the same, whether the chiral rotation is applied to the mass,\nwhile the boundary condition is fixed, or applied to the boundary condition, while the mass\nremains constant (as in Yamagishi's work on monopole dyon charge [1]). The leakage in our\nexample involves exactly half a unit of mode number, and this shift reconciles the count of\nfermion modes with the principle of mode number regularization.\nA second approach is to use fixed boundary conditions, which insures no leakage of\nmode number, but to average over a set of boundary conditions, so that in the average any\ncontributions to the energy localized near the boundary cancel out. In this case, the mode\nnumber regularization is used for each set of fixed boundary conditions, but in some cases\nthere are two zero-frequency solutions in the kink sector, one localized near the kink and\none localized near the boundary, and in some cases there is one in the kink sector localized\nat the kink and one in the vacuum sector localized near the boundary. When the difference\nbetween the sectors is two solutions in the kink sector, this implies one (delocalized) zero\nmode in the kink sector. Thus the average over all boundary conditions amounts to half a\nzero mode excess in the kink sector.\nWe see that the two different approaches agree: Effectively there is a half-mode at zero\nenergy in the kink sector. This was discussed already by GJ (who analyzed half-modes at\nzero energy as well as nonlocalized 'half-bound' modes at the continuum threshold). What\nGLV1 added was a precise specification of the boundary conditions which make this notion\nwell defined. The half-mode has the consequence for the mode sums used to compute the\nenergy that at the cutoff one needs to include an excess of one half-mode in the sum for\nthe vacuum energy compared to the sum for the kink energy. One may recognize this fact\ndirectly by matching modes so as to insure that no difference between the two sums linear\nin the energy will occur. Thus, as with many other examples of anomalies and associated\nregulation prescriptions, one may find the correct prescription and its implications either by\nfocusing on the lowest energies (in this case zero modes), or on the highest energies.\nThe half mode bears an interesting relation to the original discovery by Jackiw and Rebbi\n[18] that a soliton can polarize a charged fermion vacuum to localize a half unit of fermion\nnumber around the soliton. For neutral excitations, there is no directly observable charge\nor charge density that corresponds to a mode or to the probability density in its wave\nfunction. Nevertheless modes of nonzero energy contribute to vacuum zero point energy and\nenergy density. Thus mode number and mode density are mathematically well defined and\nindirectly observable, making them also meaningful, even if not so tangible as the directly\nobservable charge and charge density of a charged field. In other words, mode number 1/2\nhas operational significance just as does charge 1/2. A further indication of this significance\nis additivity: Two configurations each possessing a zero frequency solution corresponding to\n\n\f9\nmode number 1/2, when brought within a finite distance of each other, accommodate one\nobservable excitation with near-zero energy. Thus, even though it is not possible to define\ndirectly a \"half-excitation\" it is possible to count a half-mode, and to combine two of them\nto make not only a full mode but also a full excitation or fermion state.\nAlthough the invisible boundary conditions guarantee that the quantum correction is\nprecisely the mass shift of the soliton, there remains even in this case a strong reason for\naveraging over each of the two types of condition, namely to enforce time-reversal symmetry.\nA chiral or twisted boundary condition produces different spectra for right-moving and leftmoving waves. Time reversal symmetry interchanges TP and TAP boundary conditions, so\nthat by averaging over the two one restores the symmetry. In the vacuum or trivial sector,\nperiodic and antiperiodic conditions (being real) each separately produce spectra invariant\nunder the symmetry.\nB.\n\nLocal mode regularization from higher-derivative regularization\n\nSVV in their discussion emphasized the value of using a local regularization scheme\nwhich enforces supersymmetry, in particular, higher-derivative regularization. In GLV2 it\nwas shown that a familiar scheme, point\u2013splitting regularization, implies local mode regularization for energy density. Here we show directly that higher-derivative regularization also\nimplies local mode regularization for energy density, thus verifying explicitly its consistency\nwith supersymmetry.\nIn higher derivative regularization, extra terms are added to the Lagrangian involving\nextra factors of the square of the spatial gradient of the field. This gives rise to an equation\nfor small fluctuations of a Bose field, including a possible background 'potential' V (x),5\n\u03c9 2 (1 \u2212 \u2202x2 /\u039b2 )\u03c6 = \u2212\u2202x2 \u03c6 + m2 \u03c6 + V (x)\u03c6 + \u2202x4 \u03c6/\u039b2 .\n\n(2)\n\nOur notation uses \u039b as the regulator mass called Mr by SVV. The effect of the higherderivative term on the classical kink solution and the resulting potential V (x) for fluctuations\ntends to zero for large \u039b, and therefore is ignored in our discussion, i.e., we use the V\nobtained from the classical solution of the unregulated equations. Here as in GLV2, we may\nuse the JWKB approximation to estimate the wave functions at large \u03c9. This allows one to\ndetermine with sufficient accuracy the phase space density of these wave functions both for\nthe trivial or vacuum background with V = 0 and the kink background with\nV = \u22123m2 /2 cosh2 (mx/2) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere m is the mass for small fluctuations about the trivial vacuum. Then one may obtain\na subtracted density which can be integrated to give the high-energy contribution to the\nregulated net local mode density, as we shall now see.\n\u221a\nConcentrate on a high-energy regime, with wave vectors |k| > K \u226b V , with \u03c9 2 \u2261\nk 2 + m2 /(1 + k 2 /\u039b2 ), and take \u039b \u226b K.

Define normalization of the wave function \u03c6k (x) so that \u03c62 is equal to unity\nfar from the region of the potential. The regulated mode density before subtraction is then\nd\u03c1(x)/d|k| = \u03c6k (x)\u2217\n\n1\n\u03c6k (x)/\u03c0 .\n1 \u2212 \u2202x2 /\u039b2\n\n(6)\n\nTo lowest order in V /K 2 and V /\u039b2 we now compute the mode density difference\n\u001a \u0014 2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\u001b\u001e\u0014 2\n\u00153\nV (x) 1\nk\n1 k2\nk\nd\u03b4\u03c1/d|k| =\n5 +1 + 2 2 +1\n+1\n.\n2\u03c0 k 2 \u039b2\n\u039b \u039b\n\u039b2\n\n(7)\n\nHere the first term in the large braces comes from the influence of V (x) on the absolute\nsquare of the wave functions, while the second term comes from the influence of V on the\nregulating denominator in Eq.

This integral is easily evaluated, yielding a total high-energy\ncontribution to the regulated (but not yet renormalized) energy density\n\u0014\n\u0015\nV (x)\n\u039b2\nEunrenormalized (x) =\n2 + ln 2 .\n(11)\n8\u03c0\nK\n\n\f11\nHere the anomaly term 2 in Eq. (11) bears exactly the same ratio to the term (compensated\nby mass renormalization) ln\u039b2 as found by SVV in their analysis of the supersymmetric\nkink, e.g., their Eq. (4.5). This ratio of course is trivial in local mode regularization, as is\neasy to see from the description above. However, in Eq. (11), the term 2 comes half from\nthe first term in Eq. (7) and half from the second, while the logarithm clearly comes entirely\nfrom the first.\nLooking at this straightforward but still somewhat intricate computation, one may understand why SVV focused on calculation of the anomaly in the central charge density, and\ndid not attack directly the anomaly in the energy density. However, Eq. (11) shows that the\nresult of local mode regularization for the anomaly is universally correct in higher-derivative\nregularization, and thus completes a circle:\nDHN used (global) mode regularization for the mass of the bosonic kink, but refrained\nfrom tackling the problem with fermions. Yamagishi introduced local energy and central\ncharge density calculations, but did not fully address the role of regularization in these\ncalculations. A variety of approaches using global methods managed to respect constraints\nof regulation and still circumvent the difficulty of contributions to quantum energy from\nboundary conditions on fermions.\nSVV made a complete calculation of the central charge density (both for the anomaly and\nfor other contributions) but did not compute energy density directly, so that their method\nwas not applicable in its original form for purely bosonic structures (or indeed any structure\nwithout supersymmetry). GLV2 introduced an efficient method, local mode regularization,\nfor computing the anomaly in the energy density of any system, but previous history of\nregularization schemes implies that one should check whether a new scheme preserves symmetries which we want keep at the quantum level, in this case supersymmetry. The present\ncalculation, verifying local mode regularization for arbitrary background potentials starting\nfrom higher-derivative regularization (which does preserve supersymmetry), brings us back\nto the beginning with a reliable local scheme for doing what DHN did globally.\nThere is another interesting aspect of local mode regularization. The derivation from\npoint-splitting regularization in GLV2 involves a shift in the real part of the effective wave\nnumber at a given value of k. However, the original method, and also the computation\ndone here, involves an integration over k of the imaginary part of the wave number. This\nhas a suggestive resemblance to dispersion relations connecting the real part of a scattering\namplitude to an integral over the imaginary part, related by unitarity to a cross section.\nC.\n\nWhy is rigorous, manifest supersymmetry unnecessary for correct calculation?\n\nWe have seen that a completely rigorous and systematic way to assure consistency with\nsupersymmetry in computing the quantum correction to the mass and central charge of\na soliton is to insist on explicit supersymmetry at every step. Thus SVV adopted the\napproach of higher-derivative regularization in the ultraviolet and supersymmetric boundary\nconditions discretizing the spectrum to provide infrared regularization. They then computed\na local central charge density in the vicinity of the kink, and its spatial integral in a large\nbut finite region around the soliton, which gives the desired quantum correction. While this\nis the safest method, and also fairly straightforward because the central charge density has\na weaker superficial divergence than the energy density, a number of other methods all yield\nthe same result.\nIt seems to us that this not only demonstrates that the result is correct, but also suggests\n\n\f12\nthat there is a deeper principle behind the robustness of that result. The principle, we\nsuggest, is cluster decomposition. In GLV1 it was deduced erroneously from an incomplete\ncalculation that besides localized energy in the vicinity of the kink and possible localized\nenergy near the boundary, there can be a delocalized energy, giving a finite contribution.\nThey imposed the principle of cluster decomposition to sum over different boundary conditions, so that the delocalized energy violating cluster decomposition would cancel out. It\nwas observed by Wimmer [13], and argued in detail in the light of the discrete C,P. and T\nsymmetries by Goldhaber, Rebhan, van Nieuwenhuizen, and Wimmer [19] that such delocalized energy does not appear in mode number regularization for known boundary conditions.\nCluster decomposition is satisfied automatically. Thus, a boundary condition which violates\nthe supersymmetry preserved by the kink can alter the energy localized near the boundary,\nbut cannot influence the energy localized near the soliton, i.e., the quantum correction to\nthe kink mass. This means that if one uses boundary conditions which do not result in\nboundary energy, or if one averages over conditions so that there is no net boundary energy,\nthen the resulting global calculation is reliable for the mass of the kink. This is true even if\nthe boundary conditions do not preserve supersymmetry \u2013 that violation does not propagate\ninto the region of the kink.\nAs pointed out in GLV2, even methods whose consistency with supersymmetry has not\nbeen explicitly established, such as point-splitting regularization, give the same answer not\nonly for the energy density but also for the central charge density. Thus these local densities\nare quite robust with respect to the choice of (local) regularization methods. This suggests\nthat, despite the long history of discrepant calculations, one must make quite a large error\nto get the wrong answer for the local densities. For example, failure to specify carefully the\nregularization method can make the result indeterminate, and therefore most likely wrong.\nThe history of incorrect global calculations draws attention in particular to regulation by\nenergy cutoff, which was used in many of those calculations. As local mode regularization\nmakes manifest, using a fixed and identical energy cutoff for kink and trivial backgrounds\nis incorrect. Litvintsev and van Nieuwenhuizen [20] proposed a method to repair energy\ncutoff, which is mathematically equivalent to replacing it with mode number regularization.\nIII.\n\nDIMENSIONAL REGULARIZATION OF THE SUSY KINK\n\nUsually dimensional regularization breaks susy. However, the 1+1 dimensional N = 1\nsusy kink can be embedded as a domain wall in 2+1 dimensions with the same field content\nwhile keeping N = 1 susy invariance.\nFor the corresponding classically BPS saturated domain wall (a 1+1 dimensional object\nby itself), [21] has also found a nontrivial quantum correction to the energy density. In order\nto have BPS saturation at the quantum level in 2+1 dimensions, there has to be a matching\ncorrection to the momentum in the extra dimension which corresponds to the central charge\nof the 1+1 dimensional case.\nIn this section we show that if one uses susy-preserving dimensional regularization by\nmeans of dimensional reduction from 2+1 dimensions, one indeed finds the required correction to the extra momentum. Such a nonvanishing correction turns out to be possible\nbecause the 2+1 dimensional theory spontaneously breaks parity.\nBy dimensionally reducing to 1+1 dimensions, the parity-violating contributions to the\nextra momentum turn out to provide an anomalous contribution to the central charge as\nobtained in Ref. [11], thereby giving a novel physical explanation of the latter [22]. This is\n\n\f13\nin line with the well-known fact that central charges of susy theories can be reinterpreted as\n\"momenta\" in higher dimensions.\nThe latter statement has to be handled with care, though. The classical central charge\nstems entirely from the classical antisymmetric part of the energy momentum tensor of\nthe 2 + 1 dimensional theory and thus would be missed by dimensional reduction if one\nwere to start in 2 + 1 dimensions with the gravitational energy momentum tensor, which is\nalways symmetric on-shell (in the absence of local Lorentz anomalies) and which contains\nthe genuine momentum operator. However, it is the symmetric part of the 2 + 1 dimensional\nEM-tensor which gives the anomalous contribution to the quantum central charge. This\nanomalous contribution can be reduced to a surface term and is thus completely determined\nby the topology of the soliton background, independent of the precise field profile in the\nbulk. Therefore when we refer to the \u03c64 kink in the following, this is just a special case of\na more general situation.\nIn the case of the susy kink, standard ('t Hooft-Veltman) dimensional regularization is\nseen to be compatible with susy invariance only at the expense of a spontaneous parity\nviolation, which in turn allows non-vanishing quantum corrections to the extra momentum\nin one higher spatial dimension. On the other hand, as we shall see, the surface term that\nprovides the classical central charge does not receive quantum corrections in dimensional\nregularization, by the same reason that led to null results previously in other schemes [5, 6, 8].\nIn dimensional regularization (by going up in the number of dimensions), the nontrivial\nanomalous quantum correction to the central charge operator is thus seen to be entirely the\nremnant of the spontaneous parity violation in the higher-dimensional theory in which a\nsusy kink can be embedded by preserving minimal susy.\nAlternatively, we shall consider dimensional regularization by dimensional reduction from\n1 to 1-\u01eb spatial dimensions, which also preserves supersymmetry. In this case we show that an\nanomalous contribution to the central charge arises from the necessity to add an evanescent\ncounterterm to the susy current [22]. This counterterm preserves susy but produces an\nanomaly in the conformal-susy current. We also construct the conformal central-charge\ncurrent [22] whose divergence is proportional to the ordinary central-charge current and\nthus contains the central-charge anomaly as superpartner of the conformal-susy anomaly\n[11].\nA.\n\nThe model\n\nA real scalar field model in 1+1 dimensions with spontaneously broken Z2 symmetry (\u03c6 \u2192\n\u2212\u03c6) has topologically nontrivial finite-energy solutions called \"kinks\" which interpolate\nbetween the two neighboring degenerate vacuum states, as for example \u03c6 = \u00b1v.

With a compact extra dimension one can use these configurations to\nform \"domain strings\" of finite total energy proportional to the length L of the string when\nwrapped around the extra dimension.\nThe 2+1 dimensional case is different also with respect to the discrete symmetries of (12).\nIn 2+1 dimensions, \u03b3 5 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 = \u00b11 corresponding to the two inequivalent irreducible\nrepresentations for \u03b3 2 = \u00b1\u03c3 1 . Therefore, the sign of the fermion mass (Yukawa) term can no\nlonger be reversed by \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5 \u03c8 and there is no longer the Z2 symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5 \u03c8.\nWhat the 2+1 dimensional model does break spontaneously instead is parity, which\ncorresponds to changing the sign of one of the spatial coordinates. The Lagrangian is\n6\n\nSee [21] for a detailed discussion of more general renormalization schemes in this context.\n\n\f15\ninvariant under xm \u2192 \u2212xm for a given spatial index m = 1 or m = 2 together with \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6\n(which thus is a pseudoscalar) and \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 m \u03c8. Each of the trivial vacua breaks these\ninvariances spontaneously, whereas a kink background in the x1 -direction with \u03c6K (\u2212x1 ) =\n\u2212\u03c6K (x1 ) preserves x1 = x reflection symmetry, but breaks it with respect to x2 = y.\nThis is to be contrasted with the 1+1 dimensional case, where parity (x1 \u2192 \u2212x1 ) can be\nrepresented either by \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 0 \u03c8 and a true scalar \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 or by \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 1 \u03c8 and a pseudoscalar\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. The former leaves the trivial vacua invariant, and the latter the ground state of\nthe kink sector.\nB.\n\nSusy algebra\n\nThe susy algebra for the 1+1 and the 2+1 dimensional cases can both be covered by\nstarting from 2+1 dimensions, the 1+1 dimensional case following from reduction by one\nspatial dimension.\nIn 2+1 dimensions one obtains [25]\n{Q\u03b1 , Q\u0304\u03b2 } = 2i(\u03b3 M )\u03b1 \u03b2 PM ,\n\n(M = 0, 1, 2)\n= 2i(\u03b3 0 H + \u03b3 1 (P\u0303x + Z \u0303y ) + \u03b3 2 (P\u0303y \u2212 Z\u0303x ))\u03b1 \u03b2 ,\n\nwhere we separated off two surface terms Z\u0303m in defining\nZ\n1\nP\u0303m = dd xP\u0303m ,\nP\u0303m = \u03c6\u0307 \u2202m \u03c6 \u2212 (\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 0 \u2202m \u03c8),\n2\nZ\nZ\u0303m = dd xZ\u0303m ,\nZ\u0303m = U(\u03c6)\u2202m \u03c6 = \u2202m W(\u03c6)\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nR\nwith W(\u03c6) \u2261 d\u03c6 U(\u03c6). Note that the usual central charge density of the two-dimensional\nmodel, Z\u0303m , is obtained by dimensional reduction of the antisymmetric part of the threedimensional energy momentum tensor. The local version of the susy algebra (18) is obtained\nby a susy variation (16) of the supercurrent (17) as follows\nT M N \u223c T r(\u03b3 M \u03b4j N ) = T r(\u03b3 M \u03b3 N \u03b3 P ) \u2202P \u03c6U(\u03c6) + symm. part\n\u223c \u03b5M N P \u2202P \u03c6U(\u03c6) + symm. part,\n\n(21)\n\nand the central charge density is then the momentum density T 02 in the reduced extra\ndimension.\nWith our choice of Dirac matrices the supercharges and the superalgebra they generate\nare given by\nZ\n\u00b1\nQ = d2 x[(\u03c6\u0307 \u2213 \u2202y \u03c6)\u03c8 \u00b1 + (\u2202x \u03c6 \u00b1 U(\u03c6))\u03c8 \u2213 ],\n(22)\n{Q\u00b1 , Q\u00b1 } = 2(H \u00b1 (Z\u0303x \u2212 P\u0303y )), {Q+ , Q\u2212 } = 2(P\u0303x + Z\u0303y ) .\n\n(23)\n\nHaving a kink profile in the x-direction, which satisfies the Bogomol'nyi equation \u2202x \u03c6K =\n\u2212U(\u03c6K ), one finds that the charge Q+ (corresponding to the terms in (16) with \u01eb\u2212 ) leaves\nthe classical topological (domain-wall) vacuum (\u03c6 = \u03c6K , \u03c8 = 0) invariant. This corresponds\nto classical BPS saturation, since with Px = 0 and P\u0303y = 0 one has {Q+ , Q+ } = 2(H + Z\u0303x )\nand, indeed, with a kink domain wall Z\u0303x /Ld\u22121 = W(+v) \u2212 W(\u2212v) = \u2212M/Ld\u22121 .\n\n\f16\nAt the quantum level, hermiticity of Q\u00b1 and positivity of the Hilbert space norm imply\na lower bound for the energy(density):\nh\u03a3|H|\u03a3i \u2265 | h\u03a3|Py |\u03a3i | \u2261 |h\u03a3|(P\u0303y \u2212 Z\u0303x )|\u03a3i|,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere |\u03a3i denotes any state in the Hilbert space. This inequality is saturated when\nQ+ |\u03a3i = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nMassive BPS states in 1+1 dimensions correspond to massless states in 2+1 dimensions,\nsince with [H, Pm ] = 0 one has\nhPM P M i = \u2212 41 h(Q+2 Q\u22122 \u2212 {Q+ , Q\u2212 }2 i = 0\n\n(26)\n\nfor BPS saturated states (25) with hPy i = M for a kink domain wall with kink profile in\nthe x-direction. An anti-kink domain wall has instead Q\u2212 |\u03a3i = 0. In both cases, half of the\nsupersymmetry is spontaneously broken. To take into account that there is infinite momentum and energy unless the y-direction is compact with finite length L, one can formulate\nthe above identities for energy and central charge per unit length or for energy and central\ncharge densities.\nOmitting regularization the susy algebra in 1+1 dimensions is obtained from (18) simply\nby dropping P\u0303y as well as Z\u0303y so that Px \u2261 P\u0303x . The term \u03b3 2 Z\u0303x remains, however, with \u03b3 2\nbeing the nontrivial \u03b3 5 of 1+1 dimensions. Identifying Z\u0303x with Z, the susy algebra simplifies\nto\n{Q\u00b1 , Q\u00b1 } = 2(H \u00b1 Z), {Q+ , Q\u2212 } = 2Px\n(27)\nand one obtains the quantum BPS bound\n\nh\u03c8|H|\u03c8i \u2265 |h\u03c8|Z|\u03c8i|\n\n(28)\n\nfor any state |\u03c8i. BPS saturated states have Q+ |\u03c8i = 0 or Q\u2212 |\u03c8i = 0, corresponding to\nkink and anti-kink, respectively, and break half of the supersymmetry.\nC.\n\nFluctuations\n\nIn a kink (or kink domain wall) background one spatial direction is singled out and we\nchoose this to be along x. The direction orthogonal to the kink direction (parallel to the\ndomain wall) will be denoted by y.\nThe quantum fields can then be expanded in the eigenfunctions, which are known analytically for the \u03c64 and sine-Gordon soliton [24], times plane waves in the extra dimensions.\nFor the bosonic fluctuations we have\n2\n\n[\u2212\u0003 + (U \u2032 + UU \u2032\u2032 )]\u03b7 = 0\nwhich is solved by\nZ\nZ\n\u0011\ndd\u22121 l X dk \u0010\n\u2020\n\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212ly)\ni(\u03c9t\u2212ly) \u2217\n\u221a\n\u03b7=\nak,l e\n\u03c6k (x) + ak,l e\n\u03c6k (x) .\nd\u22121\n4\u03c0\u03c9\n(2\u03c0) 2\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n\f17\nR\nThe kink eigenfunctions \u03c6k are normalized according to dx|\u03c6|2 =\nR 1 for the discrete states\nand to Dirac distributions for the continuum states according to dx \u03c6\u2217k \u03c6k\u2032 = 2\u03c0\u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 ).\nThe latter are deformed plane\np waves because there is no reflection in the case of the kink.\nThe mode energies are \u03c9 = \u03c9k2 + l2 where \u03c9k is the energy in the 1+1-dimensional case.\nThe canonical equal-time commutation relations [\u03b7(~x), \u03b7\u0307(~x\u2032 )] = i\u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 ) are fulfilled\nwith\n(31)\n[ak,l , a\u2020k\u2032 ,l\u2032 ] = \u03b4kk\u2032 \u03b4(l \u2212 l\u2032 ),\nwhere for the continuum states \u03b4k,k\u2032 becomes a Dirac delta function.\nFor the fermionic modes which satisfy the Dirac equation [ 6 \u2202 + U \u2032 ]\u03c8 = 0, i.e. explicitly\n(\u2202x + U \u2032 )\u03c8 + + i(\u03c9 + l)\u03c8 \u2212 = 0,\n(\u2202x \u2212 U \u2032 )\u03c8 \u2212 + i(\u03c9 \u2212 l)\u03c8 + = 0,\none finds\n\u03c8 = \u03c80 +\n\u03c80 =\n\nZ\n\nZ\ndd\u22121 l X\u2032\nd\u22121\n\n(2\u03c0) 2\nZ\ndd\u22121 l\n(2\u03c0)\n\nd\u22121\n2\n\nb0,l\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\u221a\n\u0014\n\u03c9+l \u03c6k (x)\ndk\n\u2020\n\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212ly)\n\u221a\n+ bk,l (c.c.) ,\nbk,l e\n\u221a\n\u03c9\u2212l isk (x)\n4\u03c0\u03c9\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2212il(t\u2212y) \u03c60\n, b\u20200 (l) = b0 (\u2212l).\ne\n0\n\n(32)\n\nThe fermionic zero mode7 of the susy kink turns into massless modes located on the domain\nwall, which have only one chirality, forming a Majorana-Weyl domain wall fermion [21, 26\u2013\n28].8\nFor the massive modes the Dirac equation relates the eigenfunctions appearing in the\nupper and the lower components of the spinors as follows:\nsk =\n\n1\n1\n(\u2202x + U \u2032 )\u03c6k = \u221a\n(\u2202x + U \u2032 )\u03c6k ,\n2\n\u03c9k\n\u03c9 \u2212 l2\n\n(33)\n\nso that the function sk is the SUSY-quantum mechanical [29] partner of \u03c6k and thus coincides\nwith the eigen modes of the sine-Gordon model if \u03c6k belongs to the \u03c64 -kink (hence the\nnotation) [30]. With (33), their normalization is the same as that of the \u03c6k . It is the\nrelation (33) and the fact that it relates bosonic to fermionic modes, as well as different\ncomponents of the fermionic modes to each other, which makes it possible to compute the\none loop-corrections to energy and central charge without explicit knowledge of the mode\nfunctions.\nThe canonical equal-time anti-commutation relations {\u03c8 \u03b1 (~x), \u03c8 \u03b2 (~x\u2032 )} = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 ) are\nsatisfied if (using that \u03c6\u2212k (x) = \u03c6\u2217k (x) and s\u2212k (x) = s\u2217k (x))\n{b0 (l), b\u20200 (l\u2032 )} = {b0 (l), b0 (\u2212l\u2032 )} = \u03b4(l \u2212 l\u2032 ),\n{bk,l , b\u2020k\u2032 ,l\u2032 } = \u03b4k,k\u2032 \u03b4(l \u2212 l\u2032 ),\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(34)\n\nBy a slight abuse of notation we shall always label this by a subscript 0, but this should not be confused\nwith the threshold mode k = 0 (which does not appear explicitly anywhere below).\nThe mode with l = 0 corresponds in 1+1 dimensions to the fermionic zero mode of the susy kink. If there\nare no other fermionic zero modes, it has to be counted as half a degree of freedom in mode regularization\n[14]. For dimensional regularization such subtleties do not play a role because the zero mode only gives\nscale-less integrals and these vanish.\n\n\f18\nand again the \u03b4k,k\u2032 becomes a Dirac delta for the continuum states. The algebra (34) and\nthe solution for the massless mode (32) show that the operator b0 (l) creates right-moving\nmassless states on the wall when l is negative and annihilates them for positive momentum\nl. Thus only massless states with momentum in the positive y-direction can be created.\nChanging the representation of the gamma matrices by \u03b3 2 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3 2 , which is inequivalent\nto the original one, reverses the situation. Now only massless states with momenta in the\nnegative y-direction exist. Thus depending on the representation of the Clifford algebra one\nchirality of the domain wall fermions is singled out. This is a reflection of the spontaneous\nviolation of parity when embedding the susy kink as a domain wall in 2+1 dimensions.\nNotice that in (32) d can be only 2 or 1, for which l has 1 or 0 components, so for strictly\nd = 1 one has l \u2261 0. In order to have a susy-preserving dimensional regularization scheme\nby dimensional reduction, we shall start from d = 2 spatial dimensions, and then make d\ncontinuous and smaller than 2.\nD.\n\nEnergy corrections\n\nBefore turning to a direct calculation of the anomalous contributions to central charge\nand momentum, we derive the one-loop energy density of the susy kink (domain wall) in\ndimensional regularization.\nExpanding the Hamiltonian density of the model (12),\n1\n1\n~ + U \u2032 (\u03c6)]\u03c8,\nH = [\u03c6\u0307 + (\u2207\u03c6)2 + U 2 (\u03c6)] + \u03c8 \u2020 i\u03b3 0 [~\u03b3 \u2207\n2\n2\n\n(35)\n\naround the kink/domain wall, using \u03c6 = \u03c6K + \u03b7, one obtains\nH =\n\n\u03b4\u03bc2\n1\n[(\u2202x \u03c6K )2 + U 2 ] \u2212 \u221a U \u2212 \u2202x (U\u03b7) +\n2\n2\u03bb\n1\n1 2\n~ 2 + (U 2 )\u2032\u2032 \u03b7 2 ] + 1 \u03c8 \u2020 i\u03b3 0 [~\u03b3 \u2207\n~ + U \u2032 ]\u03c8 + O(~2 ),\n+ [\u03b7\u0307 + (\u2207\u03b7)\n2\n2\n2\n\n(36)\n\nwhere U without an explicit argument implies evaluation at \u03c6 = \u03c6K and use of the renormalized \u03bc2 . The first two terms on the r.h.s. are the classical energy density and the counterterm\ncontribution. The terms quadratic in the fluctuations are the only ones contributing to the\ntotal energy.9 They give [22]\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\nZ\n1\ndd\u22121 l X dk \u2032 |\u03c6k |2\n(2)\nhH i = \u2212\u2202x\nU\n2\n(2\u03c0)d\u22121\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c9\nZ\nZ\nd\u22121\n2\n1\nd l X dk l\n+\n(|\u03c62k | \u2212 |sk |2 ).\n(37)\nd\u22121\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0 2\u03c9\nWhen integrated, the first term, which is a pure surface term, cancels exactly the counterterm\n(see (15)), because\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1 \u2032 2 \u221e\ndk 1\ndd\u22121 l\n1\n\u2032 2\n\u2261 m\u03b4v 2 ,\n(38)\ndxh \u2202x (U \u03b7 )i = U h\u03b7 i|\u2212\u221e = m\nd\u22121\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0 2\u03c9\n9\n\nThe third term in (36) is of relevance when calculating the energy profile [11, 12].\n\n\f19\nwhere we have used that U \u2032 (x = \u00b1\u221e) = \u00b1m.\nIn these expressions, the massless modes (which correspond to the zero mode of the 1+1\ndimensional kink) can be dropped in dimensional regularization as scale-less and thus vanishing contributions, and the massive discrete modes cancel between bosons and fermions.10\nUsing the explicit form of \u03c6k (x), sk (x) as given e.g. in [12], the x-integration over the continuous mode functions gives the required difference of spectral densities as\nZ\n2m\n,\n(39)\ndx(|\u03c6k (x)|2 \u2212 |sk (x)|2 ) = \u2212\u03b8\u2032 (k) = \u2212 2\nk + m2\nwhere \u03b8(k) is the additional phase shift of the mode functions sk compared to \u03c6k .\nWith the help of the susy-quantum mechanical relation (33) for the fermionic modes in\nthe BPS background the integral (39) can also be computed without detailed knowledge\nof the mode functions [31]. Denoting the operator in (33) by A = \u2202x + U \u2032 the fluctuation\nequation above (30) of the \"bosonic\" modes \u03c6k factorizes as\nA\u2020 A\u03c6k = \u03c9k2 \u03c6k ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere A\u2020 = \u2212\u2202x + U \u2032 is the adjoint operator.

The surface term results from the fact that\nin the above expression the operator A\u2020 is only formally the hermitian conjugate of A.

However, this leads just to the contribution shown in (38), which\nmatches precisely the counterterm m\u03b4v 2 from requiring vanishing tadpoles. Straightforward\napplication of the rules of dimensional regularization thus leads to a null result for the net\none-loop correction to hZ\u0303x i in the same way as found in Refs. [5, 6, 8] in other schemes.\nOn the other hand, by considering the less singular combination hH+Z\u0303xi and showing that\nit vanishes exactly, it was concluded in Ref. [9] that hZ\u0303x i has to compensate any nontrivial\nresult for hHi, which in Ref. [9] was obtained by subtracting successive Born approximations\nfor scattering phase shifts. In fact, Ref. [9] explicitly demonstrates how to rewrite hZ\u0303x i into\n\u2212hHi, apparently without the need for the anomalous terms in the quantum central charge\noperator postulated in Ref. [11].\nBecause the authors of Ref. [9] did not discuss regularization of hZ\u0303x i, the manipulations\nneeded to rewrite it as \u2212hHi (which eventually is regularized and renormalized) are not\ndefined in their work.\n\u221a regularization, hZ\u0303x i contains the\n\u221a If we choose to use dimensional\nmode energies \u03c9 = k 2 + m2 + l2 instead of \u03c9k = k 2 + m2 and so the manipulations\ncarried through in Ref. [9] (eq. 56) are no longer possible. Using dimensional regularization\none in fact obtains a nonzero result for hH + Z\u0303x i, apparently in violation of susy. However,\ndimensional regularization by embedding the kink as a domain wall in (up to) one higher\ndimension, which preserves susy, instead leads to\nhH + Z\u0303x \u2212 P\u0303y i = 0,\n\n(45)\n\ni.e. the saturation of (24), as we shall now verify.\nThe bosonic contribution to hP\u0303y i involves an l integral which is scale-less and odd and\nthus vanishes. Only the fermions turn out to give interesting contributions:\ni \u2020\nh\u03c8 \u2202y \u03c8i\n2Z\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ndd\u22121 l X\u2032 dk l\nl2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(|\u03c6k | + |sk | ) +\n(|\u03c6k | \u2212 |sk | ) .\n=\n2\n(2\u03c0)d\u22121\n2\u03c0 2\n2\u03c9\n\nhP\u0303y i =\n\n(46)\n\nWe have already omitted the contributions which vanish either by symmetric integration\nor due to scale-less integrals, which are zero in\u221adimensional regularization.

The anomaly in the central charge is\nseen to arise from a parity-violating contribution in d = 1 + \u01eb dimensions which is the price\nto be paid for preserving supersymmetry when going up in dimensions to embed the susy\nkink as a domain wall.\nIt is again the difference in the spectral densities, \u03b8\u2032 , which determines the one-loop\ncorrections, which thus depend only on the derivative\nof the pre-potential (or equivalently\nR\nthe second derivative of super potential W = d\u03c6U(\u03c6)) at the critical points \u00b1v. In general\nthe spectral density difference for a model with spontaneously broken Z2 symmetry is given\nby\nW \u2032\u2032 (v) \u2212 W \u2032\u2032 (\u2212v)\n\u03b8\u2032 (k) =\n,\n(48)\nk 2 + W \u2032\u2032 (v)2\nwhich has an obvious generalization for ZN symmetric models like the sine-Gordon model.\nFrom (40,41) one can see that this quantity is closely related to the index of the operator\nAA\u2020 . For the simple models considered here, where only one spatial direction is nontrivial,\n\u03b8\u2032 (k) is easily obtained from the Dirac equation in the asymptotic regions x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, far\naway from the kink [6]. But as we will see below, in case of a less trivial background like\nthe vortex, the formulation as surface term will provide essential simplifications [31].\nF.\n\nDimensional reduction and evanescent counterterms\n\nIn the above, we have effectively used the 't Hooft-Veltman version of dimensional regularization [32] in which the space-time dimensionality n is made larger than the dimension\nof interest. This is possible in a supersymmetric way if the model of interest can be obtained\nfrom a higher dimensional supersymmetric model by dimensional reduction. The nontrivial\ncorrections to the central charge of the kink come from the \"genuine\" momentum operator\nP\u0303y , and are due to a spontaneous breaking of parity.\nWe now comment on how the central charge anomaly can be recovered from Siegel's\nversion of dimensional regularization [33\u201335] where n is smaller than the dimension of spacetime and where one keeps the number of field components fixed, but lowers the number\nof coordinates and momenta from 2 to n < 2. At the one-loop level one encounters 2dimensional \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd coming from Dirac matrices, and n-dimensional \u03b4\u0302\u03bc\u03bd from loop momenta.\nAn important concept which is going to play a role are the evanescent counterterms [36\u201338]\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\ninvolving the factor 1\u01eb \u03b4\u0302 \u03bd\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u03c8, where \u03b4\u0302 \u03bd\u03bc \u2261 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u0302\u03bc\u03bd has only \u01eb = 2\u2212n nonvanishing components.\nThe supercurrent is given by j\u03bc = \u2212(6 \u2202\u03c6 + U(\u03c6))\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8.

The only other divergent diagram is due to\nthe term involving 6 \u2202\u03b7 in (49) and has the form of a \u03c8-selfenergy.

A susy variation of the latter shows that it forms a conformal current multiplet\n\n\f23\ninvolving besides the dilatation current T\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd and the Lorentz current T\u03bc \u03bd x\u03c1 \u01eb\u03bd\u03c1 also a current\n(\u03b6)\u03bc\nj(\u03bd) = x\u03c1 \u01eb\u03c1\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc . We identify this with the conformal central-charge current, which is to be\ndistinguished from the ordinary central-charge current \u03b6\u03bc .\n(\u03b6)\u03bc\nSince \u2202\u03bc j(\u03bd) = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u03b6 \u03bc , and \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd is invertible, the entire central-charge current \u03b6 \u03bc enters in\nthe divergence of the conformal central-charge current, whereas in the case of the conformalsusy current it was the contraction \u03b3\u03bc j \u03bc .\nThe current j (\u03b6) thus has the curious property of being completely determined by its own\ndivergence. For this reason it is in fact not associated with any continuous symmetry (as is\nalso the case for the ordinary central-charge current, which is of topological origin). In the\nabsence of classical breaking of conformal invariance it is conserved trivially by its complete\ndisappearance and then there is no symmetry generating charge operator. Nevertheless, in\nthe conformally noninvariant susy kink model this current is nonvanishing and has in addition to its nonanomalous divergence an anomalous one, namely the anomalous contribution\nto the central charge current inherited from the evanescent counterterm in the renormalized\nsusy current.\nG.\n\nMultiplet shortening, BPS saturation and fermion parity\n\nWe construct representations of the strictly two dimensional algebra\nQ+2 = H + Z , Q\u22122 = H \u2212 Z , {Q+ , Q\u2212 } = 2P,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere Q\u00b1\u2020 = Q\u00b1 are hermitian, by going to the rest frame (P = 0) in the topological\nsector, i.e. with non-vanishing central charge. M and Z are then ordinary numbers. In the\ngeneral case, M 6= |Z|, the irreducible representations are two-dimensional {|\u03a3\u2212 i|, \u03a3+ i}.\nThe supercharges can be represented as\n\u221a\n\u221a\nQ\u0302+ = M + Z \u03c31 , Q\u0302\u2212 = M \u2212 Z \u03c32 .\n(59)\nFor BPS states the absolute value of the central charge is per definition equal to the\nenergy of this state, i.e. for the eigen values in (58) we have\nM \u2212 |Z| = 0.\n\n(60)\n\nWe choose Z = \u2212M which corresponds in our convention to the kink. The algebra (58) in\nsuch a BPS representation becomes now\nQ\u0302+2 = 0 , Q\u0302\u22122 = 2M , {Q\u0302+ , Q\u0302\u2212 } = 0.\n\n(61)\n\nBecause of the hermiticity of Q\u0302+ , (61) implies ||Q\u0302+ |\u03a3i||2 = 0 and thus\nQ\u0302+ |\u03a3i = 0.\n\n(62)\n\nThis equation is equivalent to (60) for the definition of BPS states and means that the BPS\nstates are left invariant by half of the supersymmetry, namely Q+ in our case. Operators\nand states can be characterized by the cohomology of the operator Q+ . Analogous to BRST\nexact operators which have vanishing matrix elements for physical states we can say that\neach operator which is Q+ \u2013 exact has vanishing expectation value for BPS states:\nO = {Q+ , O\u2032 } \u21d2 hBP S|O|BP Si = 0.\n\n(63)\n\n\f24\nFor the other supercharge in (61) Q\u0302\u2212 , which acts nontrivially, there exist two inequivalent\nirreducible representations,\n\u221a\n(64)\nQ\u0302\u2212 |\u03a3i = \u00b1 2M |\u03a3i,\n\nwhich are connected by a Z2 transformation \u03c8 \u2192 \u2212\u03c8 for all fermions, which is clearly a symmetry for each fermionic action. Thus the irreducible representation is one-dimensional and\nthe fermionic operator is diagonal [41]. This is the reason why it was originally thought that\nmultiplet shortening does not occur in two dimensions [4, 6, 11]. Therefore a reducible two\ndimensional representation for the soliton states was assumed such that the fermion parity\noperator (\u22121)F is still defined. For a reducible two dimensional representation {|\u03a3b i, |\u03a3f i}\nwe may choose:\n\u221a\nQ\u0302\u2212 = 2M \u03c31 , (\u22121)F = \u03c33 ,\n(65)\nso that (\u22121)F is diagonal in this representation and Q\u0302\u2212 has fermion parity \u22121, i.e.\n{Q\u0302\u2212 , (\u22121)F } = 0. Note that this is the direct sum of the two inequivalent irreducible\nrepresentations (64), which are obtained as 12 (|\u03a3b i \u00b1 |\u03a3f i).\nWitten and Olive [4] argued that in four dimensional susy gauge theories the number\nof particle states is not changed in the Higgs phase, although massive representations have\n2N times as many states than massless one. Thus, they concluded that the Higgs phase\ncorresponds to a BPS saturated representation which has the same number of physical states\nas the massless representation. Because of this multiplet shortening the BPS saturation\nshould be protected against perturbative corrections since they cannot change the number\nof particle states.\nThe counting of susy soliton states in two dimensions is somewhat peculiar (see below)\nand the loss of fermion parity (64) suggested a two dimensional representation, as for the\nnon-susy soliton [18], and thus no multiplet shortening would occur. In [11], nevertheless\nBPS-saturation was assumed, to match the central charge correction to the mass correction\nobtained in [8]. The crucial relation for BPS saturation is the annihilation by one super\ncharge (62). It was stated that this relation is protected without multiplet shortening, by\nanalogous arguments that constrain supersymmetry breaking [29]. A simple argument shows\nthat this is not sufficient. Assume that in some approximation a reducible multiplet is BPS\nsaturated, i.e. Q\u0302+ |\u03a3i i = 0. Since the operator Q+ is hermitian its representation is of the\nform (because of the reducibility the Z2 \u2013grading through (\u22121)F exists)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 M\n+\nQ\u0302 =\n,\n(66)\nM\u2020 0\n\nand the BPS states can be separated in zero-eigen states of M and M \u2020 . To answer the question if the multiplet remains BPS saturated under perturbations (corrections) we consider\nthe quantity12\ni\nh\n+2\n= n0b \u2212 n0f = Ind(M),\n(67)\nlim Tr (\u22121)F e\u2212\u03b2 Q\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich is the difference between the number of zero-eigenvalue eigen states (singlets) of M\nand M \u2020 . That this index is invariant under perturbative corrections can be seen quite\nanalogously to the arguments of [29]. If a state is no longer annihilated by Q+ , say for\n12\n\nNote that BPS states (Q+2 = 0) contribute Tr|BP S (\u22121)F = n0b \u2212 n0f , whereas for non-BPS states is\nQ+2 = hH + Zi > 0 such that their contribution vanish for \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\f25\nexample one with fermionic parity, then also the bosonic super-partner state is no longer\nannihilated:\n0 6= Q+ |f i \u223c Q+ Q\u2212 |bi = \u2212Q\u2212 Q+ |bi \u2192 Q+ |bi =\n6 0.\n(68)\nSo the difference in the number of singlet states is unchanged under perturbative corrections,\nand thus it can be calculated in a semi-classical approximation. So what can this index tell\nus? In case that it would be nonzero, there would exist, at least one, BPS saturated state,\nwhich is then protected against quantum corrections. But in this case (\u22121)F is no longer\ndefined as we will see immediately. If the index vanishes in an approximation, n0b \u2212 n0f = 0,\nthe number of fermionic and bosonic singlets coincides. The trivial case is of course that they\nboth vanish already in the approximation and there are no BPS states. In the nontrivial case\nthere exist susy pairs of BPS singlets in the approximation, but susy does not protect them\nfrom being lifted pairwise above the BPS bound as described in (68). But this is exactly\nthe case of the Z2 symmetric two-dimensional multiplet (65). So the equality between the\nmass correction and the anomalous contribution to the central charge needs a different\nexplanation. In fact, it was found that one has to give up the usual fermion parity for\nthe topological soliton state which is then a single-state short super-multiplet (64) [41]. If\nwe look now again on the BPS saturation equation (62), we see immediately that a lift\nabove the BPS bound would give a twice as long irreducible multiplet (59) which cannot be\ncaused by perturbative corrections. So, in the absence of other mechanisms as for example\na difference in a conserved quantum number, multiplet shortening is a necessary condition\nfor BPS saturation being protected.\nUp to now we have only discussed abstract representations of the susy algebra (58). In a\nquantum field theory the operators in the algebra (58) and their representations correspond\nto Heisenberg operators of conserved, i.e. time-independent, charges and Heisenberg states.\nIn general neither operators nor states in the Heisenberg picture are known explicitly. Instead\none quantizes the field operators in the interaction picture in terms of creation/annihilation\noperators which are defined w.r.t. a perturbative ground state. The canonical commutation\nrelations imply an algebra for the mode coefficients which usually has to be represented in an\nirreducible manner. This determines which kind of the above representations is realized in\nthe (perturbative) quantum field theory. From the fermionic creation/annihilation operators\n(34) one obtains an infinite dimensional Clifford algebra of pairs of generators \u03b3k+ = (bk + b\u2020k )\nand \u03b3k\u2212 = i(bk \u2212 b\u2020k ) and the single generator b0 corresponding to the zero-mode. This is\nquite analogous to an odd dimensional Clifford algebra, and the operator b0 plays the role\nof the \u03b35 of the even-dimensional algebra \u03b3k\u00b1 . So there are two inequivalent representations\nof the full algebra governed by the sign of the \"gamma five\" operator b0 . Because b0 has to\nanti-commute with the bk 's it cannot be represented as a number, as in the quasi-classical\napproximation [41]. The bk -algebra can be represented as usual on a Fock space, constructed\nfrom the Clifford vacuum |\u03a9i with bk |\u03a9i = 0. The whole algebra, including b0 can then be\nrealized by two inequivalent irreducible representations [14]:\n|s\u00b1 i = 12 (1 \u00b1 b0 )|\u03a9i , b0 |s\u00b1 i = \u00b1|s\u00b1 i , bk |s\u00b1 i = 0.\n\n(69)\n\nAccording to the usual fermion-parity counting b0 is an odd, i.e. fermionic operator, and\nthus the ground states |s\u00b1 i are half fermionic and half bosonic. But in two dimensions there\nis less distinction between fermions and bosons. In fact, since there are no rotations in one\nspatial dimension, the definition of fermion parity is more abstract. Indeed, the assignment\nof fermion number to different vacua depends on the sign of the eigenvalue of the fermion\n\n\f26\nmass matrix at the considered vacuum [29]. In the case of the kink this means that if the\nvacuum with \u03c6 = +v is defined to be bosonic the vacuum at \u2212v is automatically fermionic.\nNow a topological state like the kink connects these two vacua with opposite fermion parity\nwhich heuristically explains that this state cannot have a definite fermion parity in the usual\nsense.\nLet us now check if also semi-classically the BPS saturation condition is satisfied. With\nthe regularized mode expansion for the quantum fields (30,32) and the BPS equation \u2202x \u03c6K +\nU = 0 one obtains\nZ\n+\nQ |s\u00b1 i = dx [(\u03b7\u0307 \u2212 \u2202y \u03b7)\u03c8 + + (\u2202x \u03b7 + U \u2032 \u03b7)\u03c8 \u2212 ]|s\u00b1 i + O(~)\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\ndd\u22121 l X dk \u221a\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nl\n\u2212\n\u03c9 + l)a\u2020k b\u2020k |s\u00b1 i = 0.\n=i\n(\n(70)\nd\u22121\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0\nSo both states are BPS saturated semi-classically.\nIV.\n\nSUPERSYMMETRIC VORTICES IN 2+1 DIMENSIONS\n\nFollowing [42] we next consider the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen [43\u201346] vortex solution of\nthe abelian Higgs model in 2+1 dimensions which has a supersymmetric extension [47,\n48] (for related models see [49, 50]) such that classically the Bogomolnyi bound [51] is\nsaturated. We implement dimensional regularization of the 2 + 1-dimensional N = 2 vortex\nby dimensionally reducing the N = 1 abelian Higgs model in 3 + 1 dimensions. We confirm\nthe results of [47, 52, 53] that in a particular gauge (background-covariant Feynman-'t\nHooft) the sums over zero-point energies of fluctuations in the vortex background cancel\ncompletely, but contrary to [47, 52] we find a nonvanishing quantum correction to the vortex\nmass coming from a finite renormalization of the expectation value of the Higgs field in this\ngauge [31, 53]. In contrast to [47], where a null result for the quantum corrections to the\ncentral charge was stated, we show that the central charge receives also a net nonvanishing\nquantum correction, namely from a nontrivial phase in the fluctuations of the Higgs field in\nthe vortex background, which contributes to the central charge even though the latter is a\nsurface term that can be evaluated far away from the vortex. The correction to the central\ncharge exactly matches the correction to the mass of the vortex.\nIn Ref. [52], it was claimed that the usual multiplet shortening arguments which prove\nBPS saturation would not be applicable to the N = 2 vortex since in the vortex background\nthere would be two rather than one fermionic zero modes [54], leading to two short multiplets\nwhich have the same number of states as one long multiplet.13 We show however that the\nextra zero mode postulated in [52] has to be discarded because its gaugino component is\nsingular, and that only after doing so there is agreement with the results from index theorems\n[54\u201356]. For this reason, standard multiplet shortening arguments do apply, explaining the\nBPS saturation at the quantum level that we observe in our explicit one-loop calculations.\n13\n\nIncidentally, Refs.

Renormalization of v 2 , even when only by finite amounts, will therefore contribute\ndirectly to the quantum mass and central charge of the N = 2 vortex, a fact that has been\nneglected in the original literature [47, 52] on quantum corrections to the N = 2 vortex.\nIn 2+1 dimensions, it is possible, just as in the case of the 1+1-dimensional supersymmetric kink, to adopt a \"minimal\" renormalization scheme where the wave function renormalization constants are set to unity, and only v 2 is renormalized. The renormalization of\nv 2 is then fixed by the requirement of vanishing tadpoles in the trivial sector of the 2+1\ndimensional model. The calculation can be conveniently performed by using dimensional\nregularization of the 3+1 dimensional N = 1 model. By going down in the number of spatial dimensions, 3 \u2192 3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u01eb), and setting \u01eb \u2192 0 eventually, we have a supersymmetry\npreserving regularization method in analogy to the embedding of the supersymmetric kink\nas a domain wall in up to 2 + 1 dimensions.\n\n\f30\n\u221a\nFor the calculation of the tadpoles we decompose \u03c6 = v + \u03b7 \u2261 v + (\u03c3 + i\u03c1)/ 2, where\n\u03c3 is the Higgs field and \u03c1 the would-be Goldstone boson.

Because the classical mass of the\nvortex is MV = 2\u03c0v 2 = \u03c0m2 /e2 , the counterterm \u03b4v 2 is the only one that is of importance\nto the one-loop corrections to MV .\nWhile the latter statement holds generally, the result for \u03b4v 2 does depend on the renormalization scheme adopted. If we consider more general renormalization schemes, which also\nallow for wave function renormalization, the latter do not affect the mass of the vortex, because that is evaluated at a stationary point. However, they may affect the definition of \u03b4v 2 .\nFor example, Z\u03c6 6= 1 introduces a further counter-term to (93) such that the left-hand-side\n15\n\nThe kinetic terms for s are \u2212s\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc s where s\u0304 = s\u2020 \u03c33 and \u03b3 \u03bc = {\u2212i\u03c33 , i\u03c33 \u03c3 m } with m = 1, 2, 3, and\nlikewise for d. Note also that (s\u2020 )\u03b1\u0307 = \u2212s\u0304\u03b1\u0307 according to footnote 14.\n\n\f31\nof (95) is replaced by \u03b4v 2 \u2212 v 2 \u03b4Z\u03c6 . While the residue of the scalar propagator is finite and\ndoes not enforce a nontrivial \u03b4Z\u03c6 to dispose of a UV divergence, one can nevertheless choose\na finite value of \u03b4Z\u03c6 precisely such that \u03b4v 2 = 0. By allowing for a nontrivial wave function\n1/2\nrenormalization of the vector boson field, ZA = Ze\u22121 , one can accommodate further renormalization conditions (for example an on-shell definition of the elementary masses, residues,\nand coupling constants), which generically involve a nontrivial \u03b4v 2 . In the following we shall\nhowever stick to the \"minimal\" scheme with Z\u03c6 = 1, which has been used predominantly also\nin the case of the 1+1 dimensional kink (for a detailed discussion of other renormalization\nschemes in the latter context see [21]).\nSince in general \u03b4v 2 is gauge-parameter dependent, the remaining contributions to vortex\nmass and central charge must be gauge dependent, too, so that the final result is gauge\nindependent when expressed in terms of physical parameters. (Notice that v 2 is not such a\nphysical parameter, but in any well-defined renormalization scheme it can be related to the\nphysical mass and coupling constant.)\nThe gauge breaking term in fact breaks susy, but because the final result should be gaugechoice independent, we should get the correct result for the mass and central charge from\nthis x-space susy-breaking approach. One could also use a superspace approach and fix the\nU(1) gauge symmetry without breaking rigid supersymmetry, but in the presence of solitons\nthe background superspace formalism leads to some problems, as we sketch in the appendix.\nTo gain further insight into the occurrence of tadpoles and their contribution to the\nquantum mass of the N = 2 vortex, we briefly consider an extension of the vortex model\nin which the U(1) anomaly in 3+1 dimensions cancels. In the 3+1 dimensional model,\nthe U(1) coupling of the vector multiplet to the chiral multiplet is chiral (in terms of 4component Majorana spinors it contains the matrix \u03b35 ), and in order to cancel the chiral\nU(1) anomaly,\nP additional scalar multiplets would be needed such that the sum over charges\nvanishes, i ei = 0. As it turns out, this anomalyPis also of concern in 2+1 dimensions.\nThere it does not entail a local gauge anomaly when i ei 6= 0, but leads to a parity-violating\nCherns-Simon term [59\u201361].\nThe simplest extension fulfilling this condition is massless super-QED, consisting of a\nvector multiplet coupled to two chiral multiplets with opposite electric charges and still\nwithout superpotential [62]. In such a theory, the Fayet-Iliopoulos term is not generated in\nany order of perturbation theory if it is not present classically [63]. As we now briefly show,\nthis does not imply the absence of quantum corrections to v 2 = \u03ba/e if v 2 is nonzero.\nIn massless super-QED, the kinetic term, Yukawa coupling and the scalar coupling to\nD for the new terms are the same as for \u03c8 and \u03c6, except for an opposite overall sign.\nEliminating D, the potential becomes\n\u00112\n1 \u0010\ne2\u2212 \u03ba\nV = e2 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 |\u03c6|\n(96)\n2\ne\nwhere \u03c6e is the new complex scalar. We locate the vortex solution again in \u03c6, and use\nthe same gauge fixing term as in (82).16 We find then two new couplings which produce\n\n16\n\nIn fact, it has been shown in [64] that the only solutions with nonvanishing winding number that are\ntime-independent are the original vortex solutions, with \u03c6e = 0 and the vortex located in \u03c6. An analogous\nresult holds also for the kink [65].\n\n\f32\n\u03c3-tadpoles\n\n1\n\u03c3 2 + \u03c1e2 )\n(97)\nLint,extra\n\u03c3\u2212tadpoles = em\u03c3(e\n2\nHowever, these new fields are massless and therefore the additional tadpole diagrams vanish\nin dimensional regularization.\nOn the other hand, expanding about \u03c6e = 0 the \u03c3\ne field does not have tadpole diagrams-\ne\nthere is only a \u03c7\u03c8e\n\u03c3 vertex left, but this does not give rise to a tadpole diagram because \u03c8e\ndoes not mix with \u03c7 and \u03c8 (or s and d) when \u03c6e vanishes.\nHence, the finite renormalization of v 2 in this extension of the 2+1-dimensional susy\nHiggs models is identical to that of the simpler model we have introduced above, provided\nthe minimal renormalization scheme with trivial wave function renormalization constants is\nemployed.17\nIn the following we shall show that the nonzero result for \u03b4v 2 leads to a nonvanishing\nmass correction for the N = 2 vortex in 2+1 dimensions and is in fact required to match\nan equally nonzero correction to the central charge in order that the BPS bound remains\nsaturated.\nD.\n\nQuantum corrections to mass and central charge\n\nThe expressions for the central charge and stress tensor can be constructed from the classical action without any gauge artefacts. However, when one evaluates one-loop corrections,\none uses the gauge-fixing term to obtain propagators and well-defined fluctuation equations,\nand then one should use the quantum expression for H. In that case one should consider\nsums over zero-point energies including unphysical degrees of freedom and Faddeev-Popov\nghosts. This can be done in a well-defined manner by using dimensional regularization by dimensional reduction from the 3+1 dimensional model. Using this method, the central charge\ncontains the standard 2+1 dimensional terms and, as a potential anomalous contribution, a\nremainder from the momentum operator in the extra spatial dimension.\n1.\n\nMass\n\nAt the one-loop level, the quantum mass of a solitonic state is given by\nM = Mcl +\n\n1X\n1X\n\u03c9bos \u2212\n\u03c9ferm + \u03b4M\n2\n2\n\n(98)\n\nwhere Mcl is the classical mass expressed in terms of renormalized parameters, \u03b4M represents\nthe effects of the counter-terms to these renormalized parameters, and the sums are over\nzero-point energies in the soliton background (the zero-point energies in the trivial vacuum,\nwhich one should subtract in principle, cancel in a susy theory).\n17\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the situation is more complicated in 3+1 dimensions, since there one\ncannot do without wave function renormalization.\n\n\f33\nIn the \u03be = 1 gauge the sum over zero-point energies is formally\nX\nX\nX\nX\n1X\n1X\n\u03c9bos \u2212\n\u03c9ferm =\n\u03c9\u03b7 +\n\u03c9a+ \u2212\n\u03c9U \u2212\n\u03c9V\n2\n2\nX\nX\n=\n\u03c9U \u2212\n\u03c9V ,\n\n(99)\n\nwhere the quartet (a3 , a0 , b, c) cancels separately. (Note that in (99) all frequencies appear\ntwice because all fields are complex.)\nUsing dimensional regularization for models with solitons as developed in [21], these\nsums can be made well defined by replacing all eigen frequencies \u03c9k in 2+1 dimensions by\n\u03c9k,l = (\u03c9k2 + l2 )1/2 where l are the extra momenta, and integrating over l:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nX\nX\nd2 k\nd\u01eb l\n\u03c9U \u2212\n\u03c9V =\n\u03c9k,l d2 x [|u1 |2 + |u2|2 \u2212 |v1 |2 \u2212 |v2 |2 ](x; k) (100)\n(2\u03c0)2\n(2\u03c0)\u01eb\nwhere we have written out only the contributions from the continuous part of the spectrum,\nusing that L\u2020 L and LL\u2020 , which govern U and V , respectively, are isospectral up to zero\n\u2020\n\u2020\nmodes. In dimensional\n\u221a regularization, the zero modes of L L and LL become massless\nmodes (with energy l2 ), but they can be dropped because the l-integration is scaleless,\nand thus vanishes in dimensional regularization.\nThe existing literature [47, 52] also proves that the spectral densities of the continuous\nspectrum is equal for U and V , so there is a complete cancellation of the sums over zeropoint energies in the \u03be = 1 gauge. In analogy to the calculation performed in eqs. (41) and\n(42), we can verify this result explicitly as follows.\nUsing that LUk = \u03c9k Vk and L\u2020 Vk = \u03c9k Uk , we can write the difference in the spectral\ndensities appearing in (100) as\nZ\nZ\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n\u2206\u03c1(k) = d x [Uk Uk \u2212 Vk Vk ] = d2 x [Uk\u2020 Uk \u2212 \u03c9k\u22122 (LU)\u2020k LUk ]\n(101)\nand partially integrate to obtain a surface term of the form\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22122\nd2 x{\u2202\u2212 [u\u22171 (iD+ u1 + 2e\u03c6V u2 )] + \u2202+ [u\u22172 (i\u2202\u2212 u2 \u2212 2e\u03c6\u2217V u1 )]}\n\u2206\u03c1(k) = i\u03c9k\nI\n\u22122\n= i\u03c9k lim\nd\u03b8 [u\u22171 (\u2212\u2202\u03b8 + in)u1 + u\u22172 \u2202\u03b8 u2 ] = 0,\n(102)\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u22121/2\nwhich vanishes\n.\nP because\nP cyclindrical waves decay like |u1,2 | \u223c r\nHence,\n\u03c9U \u2212 \u03c9V = 0, and all that remains is a possible renormalization of v 2 . As we\ndiscussed, in the minimal renormalization scheme where all wave functions renormalizations\nare trivial there is a finite result for \u03b4v 2 , and this leads to a nonvanishing quantum correction\nof the vortex mass according to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\n\u03c0m2 m\n2\n2\n2\nE = 2\u03c0|n|(v + \u03b4v |\u03be=1 ) = 2\u03c0|n|(v \u2212\n,\n(103)\n) \u2261 |n|\n\u2212\n4\u03c0\ne2\n2\n\nwhere \u03be = 1, since in other gauges the fluctuation equations for the B fields, i.e. \u03b7, a+ , no\nlonger match those of the U fermions. As always in quantum field theory, the explicit form of\nthe quantum corrections depends on the definition of the parameters in the Lagrangian, i.e.\n\n\f34\non the renormalization conditions employed, which we have chosen in the simplest possible\nmanner. There are of course renormalization schemes which are more physical such as onshell renormalization of the parameters in the trivial vacuum. In the case of kink and kink\ndomain walls, an extensive analysis of renormalization schemes other than the minimal one\ncan be found in [21].\nThe above result for the vortex mass in the minimal renormalization scheme agrees with\n[53], where however a careful analysis of boundary conditions in the heat-kernel approach was\nneeded because the vortex had to be put in a box to discretize the spectrum. In dimensional\nregularization one does not need to put the system in a box, and as a consequence there is\nno need to study the contributions from these artificial boundaries.\nIn the super-QED model considered at the end of the previous section we have found that\nthe additional (tilde) fields do not change \u03b4v 2 as given in (95). Concerning the additional\nfluctuation equations for these fields, these are even simpler than that of the minimal model:\nThe \u03b7e field is governed by\n\u2217V \u2217V\n(\u220232 \u2212 \u2202t2 )e\n\u03b7 = [\u2212(Dk\u2217V )2 + e2 (v 2 \u2212 |\u03c6V |2 )]e\n\u03b7 = \u2212D\u2212\nD+ \u03b7e\n\n(104)\n\nwhere D \u2217 differs from D only in the sign in front of e.

However, this is\nnot the case for the fermionic fields, which have a mode expansion of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\u221a\n\u0012 \u0013 Z\nZ\no\nn\n\u221a\u03c9\u2212l u1\n\u01eb\ndl\nU\n1\n\u2020\n\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212lz) \uf8ed \u221a\u03c9\u2212l u2 \uf8f8\n\u221a\n=\n+ dk,l \u00d7 (c.c.) ,\n(115)\n\u03a3\nbk,l e\nV\n(2\u03c0)\u01eb/2 k 2\u03c9\n\u221a\u03c9+l v1\n\u03c9+l v\n2\n\nwhere we have not written out explicitly the zero-modes (for which \u03c9 2 = l2 ). The fermionic\ncontribution to Zc reads\nD E\nZc = P\u03033 =\nZ\nZ 2 Z\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u01eb l\nl\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n=\nd\nx\n|u\n|\n+\n|u\n|\n\u2212\n|v\n|\n\u2212\n|v\n|\n(x; k)\n(116)\n\u03a3\n1\n2\n1\n2\n(2\u03c0)\u01eb k 2\u03c9\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03c9k + l2 , so that the l integral is nontrivial in dimensional regularization. Only\nthe continuous spectrum can contribute because zero modes give scaleless integrals which\nvanish in dimensional regularization and if there were other discrete states, they would\ncancel between U and V . However, the x-integration over the mode functions u1,2 and v1,2\nproduces their spectral densities, and we find\nZ\nd 2 k d \u01eb l l2\n\u2206\u03c1(k) = 0\n(117)\nZc =\n(2\u03c0)2 (2\u03c0)\u01eb 2\u03c9\nbecause \u2206\u03c1(k) = 0 as we have seen in (102). Hence, |Z| = |Za + Zb | = E, so that the BPS\nbound is saturated at the (one-loop) quantum level.\nE.\n\nFermionic zero modes and multiplet shortening\n\nMassive representations of the Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetry algebra for which the absolute\nvalue of the central charge equals the energy, i.e. when the BPS bound is saturated, contain\nas many states as massless representations, which is half of that of massive representations\nfor which the BPS bound is not saturated. These results also apply in 2+1 dimensions for\nthe N = 2 super-Poincar\u00e9 algebra [52].\nA particular multiplet of states is obtained by taking the vortex solution, and acting\non it with the susy generators of the N = 2 susy algebra, which contains two complex\ncharges Q+ , Q\u2212 , and their hermitian conjugates (Q+ )\u2020 and (Q\u2212 )\u2020 . One of these charges,\nQ+ , annihilates the vortex solution, while the other one, Q\u2212 , is to linear order in quantum\noperators proportional to the annihilation operator of a fermionic zero mode.\n\n\f37\nHowever, if there indeed is a second fermionic zero mode in the model as claimed in [52]18 ,\nin second quantization it would be present in the mode expansion of the fermionic quartet\nU and V ,\n\uf8eb 1\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1\uf8f6\n\u03c8I\n\u03c8II\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\u0307\nU\n\u03c7\u03041\u0307I \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n= aI\n+ aII \u03c7\u03040II \uf8f8 + non-zero modes.\n(118)\n0\nV\n0\n\n0\n\nAs a result, there would then be a quartet of BPS states\n\n|vi, a\u2020I |vi, a\u2020II |vi, a\u2020I a\u2020II |vi\n\n(119)\n\ncomprising two short multiplets of N = 2 susy, which are degenerate and together have\nas many states as one long multiplet without BPS saturation. As stressed in [52], the\nstandard argument for stability of BPS saturation under quantum corrections from multiplet\nshortening [4] thus would not be applicable.\nHowever, we shall now show that there is in fact only a single fermionic zero mode in a\nvortex background with winding number n = 1 [42]. To this end, we first observe that the\nzero modes must lie in U, because V is governed by the operator LL\u2020 of Eq. (91), whose\nonly zero mode solution is V0 \u2261 0. A zero mode for U must satisfy LU = 0, and to analyse\n1\n1\nthis equation we follow [52] and set \u03c8 1 (x, y) = \u2212iei(j\u2212 2 +n)\u03b8 u(r) and \u03c7\u03041\u0307 = ei(j+ 2 )\u03b8 d(r). The\nequation LU = 0 reduces then to\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nu\n\u2202r \u2212 (a\u221a+ j \u2212 21 )/r\n2ef\n= 0,\n(120)\n1\n2ef\n\u2202r + (j + 2 )/r\nd\nwhere f = f (r) and a = a(r) satisfy f \u2032 = ar f and a\u2032 = re2 (f 2 \u2212 v 2 ). Iterating this equation\nyields\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(j \u2212 12 )2\nu\n1\n2 2\n2\n\u2212 2e f\n= 0.\n(121)\n\u2202r + \u2202r \u2212\n2\nr\nr\nf\nGiven a solution for u, the corresponding solution for d follows from LU = 0.\nFor given j, this equation has two independent solutions, a linear combination of which\nyields solutions which decrease exponentially fast as r \u2192 \u221e. Hence, both solutions should\nbe regular at r = 0. For j 6= 12 , one has, using f (r \u2192 0) \u223c r n ,\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c8 1 \u223c u \u223c r n (C1 r j\u2212 2 + C2 r \u2212(j\u2212 2 ) ) for r \u2192 0\n\n(122)\n\nwhich selects for n = 1 only j = \u2212 21 . This solution is the zero mode that is obtained by\n\u221a\n\u221a\nacting with Q\u2212 on the background solutions, which gives \u03c8 1 = \u2212iD\u2212 \u03c6V / 2 = \u2212i 2f \u2032 ,\n\u03c7\u03041\u0307 = F12 = \u2212e(f 2 \u2212 v 2 ). For j = 21 , one finds for n = 1 near r = 0\n\u03c8 1 \u223c C1 (x + iy) + C2 (x + iy) ln r .\n18\n\n(123)\n\nIn the literature one can in fact find two different conventions for indicating the number of fermionic zero\nmodes. Like Refs. [52, 56] we only count the number of zero modes in the fermionic quartet (U, V ) and\nnot additionally those in the corresponding conjugated fields (U \u2020 , V \u2020 ). One zero mode in this way of\ncounting then corresponds to a pair of creation/annihilation operators. Alternatively one may count the\nzero modes in both (U, V ) and (U \u2020 , V \u2020 ) and thus ascribe one zero mode to each creation or annihilation\noperator. The latter way of counting is employed for instance in Ref. [50].\n\n\f38\nFor large r, \u03c81 \u223c e\u2212mr ei\u03b8 , as follows from (121). This solution corresponds to the second\nfermionic zero mode postulated in Ref. [52].\nHowever, while (123) is finite at the origin, the associated gaugino component is not:\n(120) implies that\nei\u03b8\n(124)\n\u03c7\u03041\u0307 \u223c C2 ,\nr\nso this solution has to be discarded when C2 6= 0.\nSimilarly, one can show that for winding number n > 1 regularity of the gaugino component generically requires that j \u2264 \u2212 12 so that the correct quantization condition for\nnormalizable fermionic zero modes is \u2212n + 12 \u2264 j \u2264 \u2212 21 . Hence, there are n independent\nfermionic zero modes, not 2n as concluded in [52]. It is in fact only the former value that\nagrees with the results [54, 56] obtained from the index theorem [55].\nAs has been proved rigorously in [66], in the bosonic sector there are 2n zero modes, which\nare related to the above n independent fermionic zero modes by supersymmetry. In the R\u03be=1\nbackground gauge \u2202\u03bc a\u03bc \u2212ie(\u03c6V \u03b7 \u2217 \u2212\u03c6\u2217V \u03b7) = 0, the bosonic zero modes satisfy a set of equations\ncompletely equivalent\nto\n\u0001\n\u0001 those for the fermionic zero modes [54]. But the linearly dependent\nsolutions U0 and i U0 correspond to linearly independent solutions for the bosonic zero\nmodes a and \u03b7.19 In particular, for n = 1, the j = \u2212 12 solution (\u03c8 1 = \u2212iu(r), \u03c7\u03041\u0307 = d(r))\nwith\n\u221a real u(r) and d(r) corresponds to the bosonic zero mode \u03b7(r) = \u2212iu(r), (a1 , a2 ) =\n( 2d(r), 0), while multiplying the\u221afermionic solution by i corresponds to the bosonic zero\nmode \u03b7(r) = u(r), (a1 , a2 ) = (0, 2d(r)), which is evidently linearly independent of the\nformer. For both solutions the R\u03be=1 gauge condition is satisfied due to the lower component\nof the field equation (120). Conversely, one can start from the classical vortex solution and\nfind two independent bosonic zero modes by considering their derivatives with respect to the\nx and y coordinates. Performing a gauge transformation to satisfy the R\u03be=1 gauge condition\nleads one back to the above solutions. This additionally confirms that the above analysis\nhas identified all fermionic zero modes in the quartet (U, V ).\nWe thus conclude that for the basic vortex (winding number n = 1) there is exactly one\nfermionic zero mode (corresponding to one pair of fermionic creation/annihilation operators)\nand this gives rise to a single short multiplet at the quantum level. Standard multiplet\nshortening arguments therefore do apply and explain the preservation of BPS saturation\nthat we verified at one-loop order.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Grant nos.

Since we want to descirbe quantum fluctuations\nabout a nontrivial background, we use the background formalism for superspace. The action\nreads \u03a6\u0304eV \u03a6, where \u03a6 = \u03c6V (x) + \u03c8(x, \u03b8) and V = VV (x) + w(x, \u03b8) for abelian gauge theories.\n19\n\nFor an analogous case see eq. (3.8) of Ref. [67].\n\n\f39\nExpanding in terms of quantum fields, the classical action contains again off-diagonal terms\nquadratic in quantum fields,\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nLkin. = d4 \u03b8 \u03c6\u2217V w\u03c8 + \u03c8\u0304w\u03c6V + . . . .\n(A1)\nTo cancel these, we try to modify the usual D = 4 gauge fixing term D 2 V D\u0304 2 V into a\nsuperspace R\u03be gauge fixing term\n1\n1\nLfix = \u2212(D\u0304 2 w + D\u0304 2 \u03c8\u0304\u03c6V )(D 2 w + D 2 \u03c8\u03c6\u2217V ).\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\n(A2)\n\nIn a trivial (constant) vacuum with \u03c6V = v, the terms \u03c8\u0304\u03c6V and \u03c6\u2217V \u03c8 are antichiral and\nchiral, respectively. So to maintain these chirality properties we extend \u03c6V (x) in the soliton\nsector to an anti-chiral superfield \u03c6V (x, \u03b8) = \u03c6V (x\u03bc \u2212 i\u03b8\u0304\u03c3\u0304 \u03bc \u03b8). Then \u03c6\u2217V is chiral, and one has\nthe identities\n1\n1\nD\u0304 2 D 2 (\u03c8\u03c6\u2217V ) = \u03c8\u03c6\u2217V ;\nD 2 D\u0304 2 (\u03c8\u0304\u03c6V ) = \u03c8\u0304\u03c6V .\n(A3)\n\u2737\n\u2737\nR 4\nThe terms \u2212 d \u03b8w(\u03c8\u03c6\u2217V + \u03c8\u0304\u03c6V ) in the gauge-fixing term cancel the classical off-diagonal\nkinetic terms just as in x-space.\nHowever, one is left with the following diagonal terms in the gauge-fixing term\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015 Z\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n1\n4\n2 1\n2\n2 1\n\u2217\n4\n\u2217\n2\n\u2217\nd \u03b8 D\u0304 (\u03c8\u0304\u03c6V ) D (\u03c8\u03c6V ) = d \u03b8 \u03c8\u0304\u03c6V (\u03c8\u03c6V ) = D (D\u0304 (\u03c8\u0304\u03c6V )) (\u03c8\u03c6V ) .\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\u2737\n(A4)\n2 2\nAlthough D D\u0304 (\u03c8\u0304\u03c6V ) produces a factor \u2737 which cancels the nonlocal 1/\u2737, further terms\nwith one or two D\u03b1 acting on \u03c8\u03c6\u2217V yield nonlocal interactions. Thus it seems that one cannot\nconstruct a local R\u03be gauge with \u03be = 1 in superspace.20\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n20\n\nH. Yamagishi, Phys.
