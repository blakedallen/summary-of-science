The phasecoherent nature of this process results in superconducting\ncorrelations being induced in the normal-metal side, referred to as the proximity effect. The important feature\nof Andreev reflection is that, with singlet superconductors, it involves both spin bands in the normal metal.\nTherefore, the above simple picture has to be modified\nwhen the normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnet with\ntwo different Fermi surfaces for the two spins, resulting in new and interesting physical phenomena. In recent years, interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism has attracted considerable theoretical2,3,4,5\nand experimental6,7,8,9 attention \u2013 both out of fundamental scientific interest and in view of the possibility of novel\napplications and devices. One important consequence of\nthe spin splitting between the two bands in the ferromagnet is that the phase coherence between the particle-hole\npair in the clean (dirty) limit\np is destroyed over a characteristic distance of vf /h ( D/h), where vf is the Fermi\nvelocity, D the diffusion constant, and h an effective exchange energy which describes the spin splitting. Since\nthis distance is typically very short (of the order of atomic\ndistances), the superconducting correlations induced to\nthe ferromagnetic material are expected to be confined to\nthe immediate vicinity of the separating interface. This\nraises the question whether, for strong ferromagnets, a\nmechanism of a different type takes over and dominates\nthe physics of superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) contacts. One such mechanism, recently under active investigation, is the inducement of spin-triplet correlations:\nnamely, the exchange field only affects correlations of\n\nsinglet type, i.e between particles and holes in opposite\nspin bands. In fact, equal-spin triplet correlations are\nexpected to be created by proximity to a ferromagnet\ndue to the breaking of spin-rotational symmetry. The\ndesire to formulate a theory capable of understanding\nthe detailed nature and the conditions for the formation\nof these correlations and the corresponding anomalous\nproximity effect has given the initial motivation for this\nwork.\nProblems related to superconducting proximity effect with spin-dependent interfacial scattering are of\nspatially inhomogeneous nature and, as such, they\ncan only be studied with specialized theoretical tools.\nSuch a tool is provided by the quasiclassical theory\nof superconductivity.10,11 This theory is applicable for\nweakly perturbed superconductors (characteristic length\nscale of perturbations much larger than Fermi wave\nlength and characteristic frequencies much less than\nFermi energy) and can be used in both equilibrium\nand nonequilibrium situations. It describes quasiparticles with momenta on the Fermi surface moving along\nstraight classical trajectories, the direction of which is\ngiven by the corresponding Fermi velocity. A ferromagnetic metal has different Fermi surfaces and, correspondingly, different sets of trajectories for the two spin orientations. In this case, the quasiclassical theory can be\nused to describe two limiting cases: i) weak ferromagnetism, where the energy splitting of the two Fermi surfaces and the associated deviation of the Fermi velocities\nis so small that the two spin trajectories with the same\nmomentum direction are fully coherent, and ii) strong\nferromagnetism, where the splitting is so large that the\ncoherence is lost completely. While the former limiting case has been exhaustively studied in the literature,\nthe latter has only recently received attention.12 Here\nwe present a theoretical study of the latter possibility.\nEven in the absence of conventional Andreev reflection\nprocesses (which would require coherence between particles and holes in opposite spin bands), interesting and\nnontrivial physics emerges due to spin-active interfacial\n\n\f2\nscattering. Additional motivation has been provided by\nthe growing interest in a new class of materials, halfmetallic ferromagnets.13,14,15,16 In these materials, one\nspin band is metallic and the other one insulating (100%\npolarized ferromagnet). Since a half metal has a Fermi\nsurface only for one of the two spin orientations, it is clear\nthat the traditional description for weak ferromagnets is\ninapplicable, and other methods must be employed.\nIn Sec. II, we outline the central equations of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity. Compared with\nthe full microscopic theory, the quasiclassical theory offers considerable simplifications when treating spatially\ninhomogeneous states by reducing the content of (unnecessary) information carried by the Green's functions.\nHowever, this leads to nontrivial boundary conditions\nwhich have to be formulated at interfaces separating different metals that connect the solutions of the two sides.\nSuch conditions have been derived for nonmagnetic interfaces by Zaitsev,17 and for magnetic interfaces by Millis\net al.18 After a short description of this work in Sec. III,\nwe formulate an alternative but equivalent set of boundary conditions, where the transmission through an interface is parameterized by a hopping amplitude that contains the information of various processes contributing\nto particle transfer. This approach enables the formulation of boundary conditions in a simple and appealing\nform. The equivalence to existing methods is demonstrated in Sec. IV. As explained in Sec. V, the advantages of the t-matrix formulation are especially evident\nin studying interfaces that separate two materials with\na different structure of the Green's functions and/or a\ndifferent number of trajectories, such as in the case of a\nsuperconductor/strong ferromagnet interface. Finally, in\nSec. VI, we apply our theory to study the current through\na point contact separating a singlet superconductor from\na strong ferromagnet.\nII.\n\nBASIC EQUATIONS OF QUASICLASSICAL\nTHEORY\n\nThe quasiclassical theory of superconductivity10,11 is\nformulated in terms of quasiclassical Green's functions\n(or propagators) \u01e7(p\u0302, R, \u01eb, t) that depend on the spatial\ncoordinate R and time t and describe quasiparticles with\nenergy \u01eb (measured from the chemical potential) and the\nmomentum direction on the Fermi surface p\u0302 = p/pf\nmoving along classical trajectories with direction given\nby the Fermi velocity vf (p\u0302).19 The quasiclassical Green's\nfunctions are 2\u00d72 matrices in Keldysh space (denoted by\na \"check\" accent),\n\n\u01e7 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u011d R \u011d K\n0 \u011d A\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nwith three nonzero elements (retarded \u011d R , advanced \u011d A ,\nand Keldysh \u011d K ). In describing superconductivity, these\nelements in turn are 4\u00d74 Nambu-Gor'kov matrices in\n\ncombined particle-hole and spin space (denoted by the\nhat symbol), for example, the retarded Green's function\nhas the form\n\uf8eb\n\nR\nR\nR\nR\ng\u2191\u2191\ng\u2191\u2193\nf\u2191\u2191\nf\u2191\u2193\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec R\n\uf8ec g\u2193\u2191\n\uf8ec\n\u011d R = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec R\n\uf8ec f \u0303\u2191\u2191\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\nf \u0303R\n\u2193\u2191\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\nR\nR\nR \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\ng\u2193\u2193\nf\u2193\u2191\nf\u2193\u2193\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\nR\nR\nR \uf8f7\nf \u0303\u2191\u2193\ng\u0303\u2191\u2191\ng\u0303\u2191\u2193\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nR\nR\nR\nf \u0303\u2193\u2193\ng\u0303\u2193\u2191\ng\u0303\u2193\u2193\n\n(2)\n\nAll these matrix elements are not independent of each\nother. Indeed, the elements in the lower half of the matrix\nare related to the ones in the upper half through the\nconjugation symmetry, e.g.\nR,A,K\nR,A,K\ng\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\n(p\u0302, R, \u01eb, t) = g\u03b1\u03b2\n(\u2212p\u0302, R, \u2212\u01eb, t)\u2217 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe quasiclassical Green's functions satisfy the Eilenberger transport equation\n\u0002\n\n\u01eb\u03c4\u030c3 \u2212 \u03a3\u030c, \u01e7\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2297\n\n+ ivf (p\u0302) * \u2207R \u01e7 = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nGenerally speaking, the self energy \u03a3\u030c(p\u0302, R, \u01eb, t) includes\nmolecular fields, the superconducting order parameter\n\u02c7 = \u2206\n\u02c6 1\u030c, impurity scattering, and external fields. The\n\u2206\nnoncommutative product \u2297 combines matrix multiplication with a convolution over the internal variables, and\n\u03c4\u030c3 = \u03c4\u03023 1\u030c is a Pauli matrix in particle-hole space.

The cut-off energy \u01ebc is to be\neliminated in favor of the transition temperature in the\nusual manner.\nWhen the quasiclassical Green's function has been determined, physical quantities of interest can be calculated; e.g. the expression for the current density adopts\nthe form\nj(R, t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb\nTrheNf vf (p\u0302)\u03c4\u03023 \u011d K (p\u0302, R, \u01eb, t)ip\u0302 ,\n8\u03c0i\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nwhere e is the electron charge and Nf is the density of\nstates on the Fermi surface. However, to form a complete\ntheory for studying heterostructures, the above equations\nmust still be supplemented with the boundary conditions\nconnecting the solutions at the separating interfaces. We\nintroduce these conditions in the following chapter.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\n\u2020\nr\nr\n\u2020\nl\nr\n(\u01e7out\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297 (\u015crr \u01e7in\n\u015crr\n\u2212 \u015crl \u01e7in\n\u015crl\n) \u2297 (\u01e7out\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c)\n= 0,\n(9d)\n\nScattering-matrix approach\n\nInterfaces represent strong perturbations on an atomic\nlength scale and, therefore, fall out of the applicability\nrange of quasiclassical theory. However, as was shown\nin the pioneering work of Zaitsev,17 interfaces can be\nbrought within the quasiclassical theory by means of effective boundary conditions that connect trajectories related through interface scattering processes. Later these\nconditions were generalized for an arbitrary magnetically\nactive interface, i.e. one that scatters quasiparticles differently depending on their spin orientation.18 The latter\ncase is relevant for studying interfaces with spin-polarized\nmaterials such as ferromagnets. The procedure for the\nderivation of the boundary conditions begins by isolating a region of quasiclassical size |x| < \u03b4 around the\ninterface located at the origin of the perpendicular coordinate x (\u03b4 much larger than the atomic-size range of\nthe strong interface potential but much smaller than the\nsuperconducting coherence length \u03be). In the half spaces\n|x| > \u03b4, the solutions for quasiclassical Green's functions\ncan be found by standard methods described in the previous chapter. The solutions for the left (l) and right (r)\nsides are then matched via a scattering matrix\n\n\u0012\n\n\u015c ll \u015c lr\n\u015c rl \u015c rr\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2020\nl\nl\nr\nl\n(\u01e7out\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297 (\u015cll \u01e7in\n\u015cll\u2020 \u2212 \u015clr \u01e7in\n\u015clr\n) \u2297 (\u01e7out\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c)\n= 0,\n(9b)\n\u2020 l\nr\n\u2020 r\nr\n(\u01e7in\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297 (\u015crr\n\u01e7out \u015crr \u2212 \u015clr\n\u01e7out \u015clr ) \u2297 (\u01e7in\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c)\n= 0,\n(9c)\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n\u015c =\n\n\u2020 r\nl\nl\nl\n(\u01e7in\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297 (\u015cll\u2020 \u01e7out\n\u015cll \u2212 \u015crl\n\u01e7out \u015crl ) \u2297 (\u01e7in\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c)\n= 0,\n(9a)\n\nwith \u01e7in = \u01e7(p\u0302) and \u01e7out = \u01e7(p\u0302), where p\u0302 (p\u0302) is a unit\nvector along the momentum direction with the perpendicular component directed towards (away from) the interface. The boundary condition consists of four coupled nonlinear equations for the incoming and outgoing matrix propagators on both sides of the interface.\nSolving this equation system and dealing with the possibility of arriving at unphysical solutions is evidently\nnot a simple task. Progress towards a more convenient form of boundary conditions has been made by Eschrig (nonmagnetic interfaces)20 and Fogelstr\u00f6m (magnetic interfaces).21 They employed the powerful Riccati\nparameterization method which allows for a considerably\nsimpler representation of boundary conditions in terms\nof the Riccati amplitudes.22 However, the conditions in\nRef. 21 were only derived for the equilibrium (retarded\nand advanced) propagators. Furthermore, even in equilibrium situations they can not be used in the published\nform in the case when the two sides of the interface have\na different number of trajectories (i.e. when matrices\n\u015clr and \u015crl are not invertable). This situation arises in\nthe context of half-metallic materials, where trajectories\nexist only for one of the spin orientations.\nB.\n\n,\n\nTransfer-matrix approach\n\n(8)\n\nthe form of which is determined by the detailed microscopic structure of the interface region and on the quasiclassical level has to be treated as a phenomenological\nparameter of the theory. The crucial simplifying observation is that, since the strong (of the order of the Fermi\nenergy) interface potential dominates the Hamiltonian\nin the interface region, the scattering matrix (8) corresponds to that of the normal state, i.e. does not contain\nparticle-hole mixing. Also, it has no Keldysh space structure.\nThe boundary conditions were derived for a smooth\n(on the scale of \u03be) interface, assuming the conservation\nof momentum pk parallel to the interface. In the following, all momentum-dependent quantities should be understood as having the same pk , unless explicitly stated.\nIn terms of quasiclassical Green's functions they adopt\nthe form18\n\nDue to the abovementioned difficulties we proceed in\nan alternative but equivalent route.23 This method requires solving for the auxiliary quasiclassical propagators \u01e7 l,0 and \u01e7 r,0 for an impenetrable interface. They are\nto be calculated with the self-energies \u03a3\u030c{\u01e7} determined\nwith the full propagator, and using the simple perfectlyreflecting boundary condition\ni,0\ni,0\n\u01e7out\n= \u015c i \u01e7in\n(\u015c i )\u2020 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere i = l, r. They also satisfy the normalization condition, \u01e7 i,0 \u2297 \u01e7 i,0 = \u2212\u03c0 2 1\u030c. The impenetrable interface\nis characterized by two surface scattering matrices, \u015c l\nand \u015c r . Particle conservation requires them to be unitary, (\u015c i )\u2020 = (\u015c i )\u22121 . The transmission processes for an\ninterface with arbitrary transparency can be taken into\naccount with a t-matrix formulation. The transfer matrices are determined with effective hopping amplitudes\n\u03c4\u0302lr and \u03c4\u0302rl by the following equations:\n\n\f4\n\nr,0 \u2020\nr,0 \u2020\nl,0\n\u0165lin = \u03c4\u0302lr \u01e7out\n\u03c4\u0302lr + \u03c4\u0302lr \u01e7out\n\u03c4\u0302lr \u2297 \u01e7in\n\u2297 \u0165lin , (11a)\n\nl,0\n\u2020\nl,0\n\u2020\nr,0\n\u0165rin = \u03c4\u0302rl \u01e7out\n\u03c4\u0302rl\n+ \u03c4\u0302rl \u01e7out\n\u03c4\u0302rl\n\u2297 \u01e7in\n\u2297 \u0165rin , (11b)\n\nwith \u03c4\u0302rl = (\u03c4\u0302lr )\u2020 due to particle conservation.

Finally, the boundary\ncondition can be expressed in terms of \u0165i and \u01e7 i,0 to read\ni,0\ni,0\ni,0\ni\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c),\n\u01e7in\n= \u01e7in\n+ (\u01e7in\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297 \u0165iin \u2297 (\u01e7in\n\ni\n\u01e7out\n\n=\n\ni,0\n\u01e7out\n\n+\n\ni,0\n(\u01e7out\n\n\u2212 i\u03c0 1\u030c) \u2297\n\n\u0165iout\n\n\u2297\n\ni,0\n(\u01e7out\n\n(13a)\n\n+ i\u03c0 1\u030c). (13b)\n\nIn the t-matrix description, the phenomenological parameters containing the microscopic information of the interface are the surface scattering matrices and the hopping\namplitudes.

In the general case\nS\u0303(pk ) = S tr (\u2212pk ).\n\n(15)\n\nIn this formulation, the boundary problem effectively reduces to calculating the auxiliary Green's functions for\nperfectly reflecting interfaces. Numerically this is an extremely simple task, e.g., employing the procedure of Riccati parameterization. Afterwards the boundary Green's\nfunctions for the partially transmitting interface can be\nobtained directly from Eqs. (13), since solving for the\nnecessary t matrices (11) only involves a 4\u00d74 matrix inversion. When contrasted with solving the group of equations (9), the t-matrix approach manifests its usefulness.\n\nIV.\n\nRELATION TO OTHER METHODS\n\nThe underlying perturbative nature of the t-matrix approach might arise suspicions concerning its applicability when the interface in question has high transparency.\nThe boundary conditions (13) are, however, valid for arbitrary transmission and, in fact, completely equivalent\nto the corresponding scattering-matrix description (9).\nThe connection between the two approaches is established by the following identification of the full scattering\n\nmatrix in terms of the surface scattering matrices and\nhopping amplitudes:\n\n\u015c =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u015cll \u015clr\n\u015crl \u015crr\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u015cl 0\n0 1\u0302\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nr\u0302 d\u02c6\n\u02c6\nd\u2020 \u2212r\u0302\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1\u0302 0\n0 \u015cr\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we have defined\nr\u0302 = (1 + \u03c0 2 \u03c4\u0302lr \u03c4\u0302rl )\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u03c4\u0302lr \u03c4\u0302rl ),\nr\u0302 = (1 + \u03c0 2 \u03c4\u0302rl \u03c4\u0302lr )\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u03c4\u0302rl \u03c4\u0302lr ), and\nd\u02c6 = (1 + \u03c0 2 \u03c4\u0302lr \u03c4\u0302rl )\u22121 2\u03c0\u03c4\u0302lr .\n\n(17a)\n(17b)\n(17c)\n\nThe identity (16) serves as a precise definition of the auxiliary matrices \u015cl and \u015cr in terms of the physical parameters of the full scattering matrix. Using (15), the particle\n(Sp ) and hole (Sh ) parts of (16) can be seen to be related\nby\n\nSh (pk ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nS\u0303l 0\n0 S\u0303r\n\n\u0013\n\nSp\u2217 (\u2212pk )\n\n\u0012\n\nS\u0303l 0\n0 S\u0303r\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nIn particular, if the interface scattering matrix is spininactive, Eqs. (9) reduce to those derived by Zaitsev. In\nthe following, we show that the solution of (13) in the appropriate limit also solve Zaitsev's boundary conditions\nfor arbitrary transmission of the interface, and in both\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. On the other\nhand, in the case of diffusive conductors the boundary\nconditions of the t-matrix approach are equivalent to the\nones derived by Nazarov.24\nA.\n\nZaitsev's boundary conditions\n\nThe boundary conditions of Zaitsev read (we suppress\nthe symbol \u2297 and unit matrices for clarity)17\n\u01e7al = \u01e7ar = \u01e7a ,\n\u01e7a [R(\u01e7s+ )2 + (\u01e7s\u2212 )2 ] = \u2212i\u03c0D\u01e7s\u2212 \u01e7s+ ,\n\n(19a)\n(19b)\n\nwhere R (D) is the reflection (transmission) coefficient,\nl,r\nl,r\n\u2212 \u01e7out\n)/2, and \u01e7s+,\u2212 = (\u01e7sr \u00b1\nR + D = 1, \u01e7al,r = \u00b1(\u01e7in\nl,r\nl,r\nl\nl,r\n\u01e7s )/2, with \u01e7s = (\u01e7in + \u01e7out )/2. In the corresponding\nlimiting case the surface scattering matrices \u015c l,r are unit\nmatrices, the hopping element can be taken as a real\nnumber, \u03c4\u0302lr = \u03c4 1\u0302, and the boundary conditions in the\nt-matrix approach are\ni\n\u01e7in\n= \u01e7 i,0 + (\u01e7 0 + i\u03c0) \u0165i (\u01e7 i,0 \u2212 i\u03c0),\ni\n\u01e7out = \u01e7 i,0 + (\u01e7 i,0 \u2212 i\u03c0) \u0165i (\u01e7 i,0 + i\u03c0),\n\n(20a)\n(20b)\n\ni,0\ni,0\nwith \u01e7in\n= \u01e7out\n= \u01e7 i,0 and \u0165iin = \u0165iout = \u0165i .

To simplify the following expressions, we again choose \u03c4\u0302lr = \u03c4 1\u0302\nand real.

Smooth interfaces between different\nmaterials introduce coupling between incoming and outgoing trajectories with the same momentum parallel to\nthe interface. A ferromagnet has a different Fermi surface\n(or, equivalently, set of trajectories) for each of the two\npossible spin orientations. Consequently, two different\nlimiting cases that allow a quasiclassical description naturally emerge (see Fig. 1). In the first case the exchange\nenergy splitting of the two Fermi surfaces is small enough\nthat the quasiparticle wave packets on the two trajectories corresponding to the same parallel momentum but\ndifferent spins overlap and, therefore, the two trajectories remain fully coherent in the ferromagnetic region\n(Fig. 1a). Technically this means that the full 2\u00d72 spin\nstructure of the quasiclassical Green's functions, defined\nby Eq. (2), is to be retained in the ferromagnetic side of\nthe interface. This case, relevant for weak ferromagnets,\nhas been widely studied in the literature; the standard\ndescription simply involves a spin-dependent shift in the\nquasiparticle energy, effected by the replacement\n\n\u01eb\u03c4\u03023 \u2192 \u01eb\u03c4\u03023 \u2212 h\u03c33 1\u0302\n\n(36)\n\nin the Eilenberger equation (4). Here h is the exchangefield parameter and \u03c33 is a Pauli spin matrix. Other\nFermi-surface parameters, i.e. Fermi velocities and the\ndensity of states, are assumed identical for the two spin\nbands in the ferromagnet.\nIn this article we restrict ourselves to the opposite limiting case of strongly ferromagnetic materials, illustrated\nin Fig. 1b. That is, we assume the exchange splitting and\nthe resulting directional deviation of the two spin trajectories sharing the same parallel momentum to be so large\nthat the coherence between them is lost completely. As a\nconsequence, the quasiclassical propagators have no matrix structure in spin space. In particular, conventional\nAndreev reflection processes are forbidden because electrons and holes in opposite spin bands occupy different\ntrajectories which do not interfere with each other. Trajectories with different spin orientations can only be coupled incoherently, such as e.g. due to elastic spin-flip\nscattering by magnetic impurities. It should be emphasized that no energy shift of the form (36) should be\nintroduced in this limit; instead, Fermi velocities and the\ndensity of states become spin dependent. The reason for\nthis is that the integration over the energy of relative\nmotion (\"\u03be integration\"), employed in the formal process\nof converting the full two-particle Green's function into\nquasiclassical ones, is now performed separately around\nthe two different Fermi surfaces.

Incoming trajectory from\nthe left-hand side and corresponding outgoing ones with the\nsame parallel momentum on both sides are indicated by arrows.\n\ncase of weak ferromagnets, where the same \u03be-integration\nrange is used for both Fermi surfaces simultaneously.\nA very interesting special case which falls into the latter category of ferromagnets with strong spin splitting is\nthat of half-metallic materials. In fact, half metals are\nmetallic in one of the spin bands only \u2013 the other one\nis insulating. Such behaviour has recently been reported\nin CrO2 15,16 and in certain manganite materials.14 and\nhas attracted considerable attention because of possible\napplications in the emerging field of spintronics.25 Since\nin half metals a Fermi surface only exists for one of the\nspin orientations, the standard description for weak ferromagnets is obviously inapplicable. However, half metals\nstill allow for a straightforward quasiclassical treatment\nin the separate-band picture: quasiparticle trajectories\nsimply exist only for one of the spin orientations.\nB.\n\nSpin mixing\n\nThe quasiclassical boundary conditions in the hopping\ndescription involve surface scattering matrices \u015c l,r that\ncharacterize a fully reflecting interface. In the case of\na magnetically active interface the most general form of\nsuch matrices (for quasiparticles), satisfying the requirement of unitarity, was pointed out by Tokuyasu et al.26\nto be\nS = e\u2212i\u03a6/2 e\u2212i(\u03b8/2)\u03bc\u0302*\u03c3 ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0302 is a unit vector pointing to the direction of the\nsurface magnetization and \u03c3 is a vector constructed of\n\n\f7\nPauli spin matrices. The corresponding scattering matrix for quasiholes follows from Eq. (15). Dropping the\nirrelevant overall phase factor \u03a6, the surface scattering\nmatrix is determined by a single parameter, the spinmixing angle \u03b8. The physics behind spin mixing can be\nvisualized as follows: even for a fully reflecting interface,\nincident wave functions penetrate a small distance into\nthe forbidden, spin-polarized region. This results in different matching conditions for waves with opposite spin\ndirections and, consequently, different phase shifts for the\nreflected waves.\nThe relative phase difference introduced by spin mixing results in interesting nontrivial phenomena at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, even in the absence\nof quantum-mechanical coherence between the two spin\nbands in the ferromagnet. One such example is the recent prediction of a nonvanishing Josephson current in\na heterostructure with a mesoscopic half-metallic piece\nseparating two singlet superconductors \u2013 driven by spintriplet pairing correlations.12 (this effect requires, in addition to spin mixing, also the presence of spin-flip centers at the interfaces). However, even though spin mixing\nis expected to be an intrinsic feature of any spin-active\ninterface, systematic experimental estimations of the typical magnitudes of \u03b8 are not yet available. As a guideline for such future experiments, we study in the following chapter the differential conductance of a spin-mixing\npoint contact between a singlet superconductor and a\nstrong ferromagnet \u2013 simultaneously offering a view of\nthe t-matrix approach at work.\n\nover trajectories with cos \u03c6 \u2265 0.

In particular, the\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a quasiclassical theory which is\nsuited for detailed studies of heterostructures consisting\nof a wide variety of materials: superconductors (both\nconventional and unconventional), normal metals, and\nboth weak and strong ferromagnets. The most crucial\npart of this description is the treatment of boundary conditions at interfaces separating different materials. These\nconditions are formulated in terms of hopping amplitudes, containing the information of allowed transmission\nprocesses, and the corresponding t matrices. Compared\nwith the traditional scattering-matrix approach, the t\n\n\f9\nmatrix approach provides clear advantages for studying\nspin-active interfaces, or interfaces which connect materials with different numbers of trajectories or with different internal structures of their Green's functions. A\nparticular example are strong ferromagnets of which the\nhalf-metallic materials form a special case. In connection with such materials, nontrivial physics arises due to\nspin-dependent interfacial scattering processes. The crucial parameter controlling the details of these effects is\nthe degree of spin mixing. At present, there have been\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nA. F.
