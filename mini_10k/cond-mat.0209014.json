This concept was originally introduced by Lee, Rice and Anderson [1] to explain\nthe suppression of electron density of states associated with order parameter fluctuations\nnear a charge density wave instability. According to one school of thought, a similar mechanism may drive the formation of the pseudo-gap in the underdoped cuprates(see reviews\n[2, 3, 4]). Many candidate fluctuating order parameters, such as antiferromagnetism[5],\ncharge density wave[6] and pre-formed Cooper pairs have been proposed [7].\nPseudo-gaps are likely to be a widespread feature of correlated electron systems lying\nclose to an instability that gaps part of the Fermi surface, and they have been observed\nin a wide variety of nested and low dimensional strongly correlated electron materials, including one dimensional charge density wave systems[8], vanadium doped Chromium[9],\ncolossal magneto-resistance compounds[10] and strontium-calcium and strontium-barium\nruthenates[11].\nThe fluctuation gap model (FGM), based on the idea of the pseudo-gap emergence due to\nfluctuating order parameter was pioneered in [1]. Later on it was shown by Sadovskii[12, 13]\nhow the problem of nested electrons moving in a critically fluctuating order parameter field\ncould be solved exactly. Interest in this model was revived with the discovery of the pseudogap in cuprates, the physical origin of which is still controversial. Schmalian et al [14]\nextended the 1D model to higher dimensions and nonzero spin. Tchernyshyov [15] later\nquestioned the exact solvability of the model for finite correlation lengths and pointed out\na previously unnoticed mistake in the Sadovskii result. Couple of years ago Millis and\nMonien[16] performed a careful study of different approximations, explaining for pseudogaps, also by Bartosch and Kopietz [17] the exact numerical calculation of the density of\nstates in FGM was carried out. They demonstrated [16, 17] that Sadovskii approach is in fact\na good approximation and the terms, omitted in his model produce negligible corrections.\nIn a related development, Kopietz et al [19] presented the exactly solvable model of extended\nFGM, where fluctuations of both phase and amplitude of the order parameter have been\ntaken into account.The important issues of crossover from Gaussian to non-Gaussian order\nparameter fluctuations in one-dimensional Peierls systems have been recently discussed by\n2\n\n\fMonien [20].\nA key idea of the Lee, Rice and Anderson paper [1]is that order parameter fluctuations can\nbe regarded as classical degrees of freedom with time-independent correlation functions. This\nbasic assumption threads through most of the subsequent developments during past twenty\nyears. This paper revisits this basic idea, making the observation that a large class of current\ntheories are theoretically equivalent to averaging the Free energy of the pseudo-gap system\nover a quenched-disordered distribution of the order parameter. The intuitive equivalence\nbetween the slow critical fluctuations responsible for pseudo-gap formation and a quenched\nrandom potential was certainly known to several authors in the past[1, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In\nthis paper, we vocalize this equivalence and set it in a formal framework. Using the idea\nwe show how the Sadovskii model of pseudo-gap formation can be formulated in terms of\na quenched average free energy. To illustrate the utility of this method, we develop a toy\nmodel for the interplay of pseudo-gap formation and weak impurity scattering with d-wave\nsuperconductivity. Our results may be of interest to recent experiments on the cuprate\nsuperconductors.\n\nII.\n\nCLASSICAL INTERACTIONS IMPLY QUENCHED DISORDER\n\nOne of the central assumptions of a large class of pseudo-gap models, is that the orderparameter fluctuations which scatter electrons to form the pseudo-gap are so slow that they\ncan be considered to be infinitely retarded. Such a state of affairs could come about in\na variety of ways. The most pragmatic point-of-view, is that the characteristic relaxation\ntimescale of the fluctuations \u03c4OP is not actually infinite, but may be treated as such because\nit is much greater than the inelastic scattering rate of the electrons \u03c4e\n\u03c4OP >> \u03c4e .\nThe result of this condition, is that electrons perceive the order parameter as a frozen degree\nof freedom, that may be treated as a classical variable.\nWe now need to consider the interactions between the electrons induced by these classical\norder parameter fluctuations. In a Feynman diagram, the net interaction induced by these\nfluctuations has a number of important features (Fig. 1.):\n\u2022 It transfers no energy, and is thus infinitely retarded. (Fig. 1 (a))\n3\n\n\f\u2022 Polarization bubble insertions into the effective interaction are absent, since these have\nalready been taken into account in forming the effective interaction (Fig. 1(b)).\n\u2022 Interactions between the classical fluctuations may be ignored. This is a useful, assumption, for it leads to non-interacting Gaussian fluctuations and permits the summation of a large class of diagrams. Unfortunately, it can not really be justified near\na critical point, where non-linear interactions between classical fluctuations are almost always relevant. This is without doubt a major weakness of the current class of\ntheories, and one we shall return to in our final discussion.\n2\n\n(a)\n\n\u2212W S(q)\nq, \u03bd=0\n\nk\u2212q,\u03c9\n\nk ,\u03c9\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1:\n\n(a) Classical fluctuations induce an interaction Vef f = \u2212W 2 S(~q) on a single line. (b)\n\nFermion loop insertions into the interaction line are neglected which means that the average over\nthe classical fluctuations is a quenched average. (c) By carrying out a quenched average, we also\neliminate interactions between fluctuations of the form shown here.\n\nThe first feature can be incorporated into a model by introducing a coupling into the Hamiltonian\nH[\u03c6] = Ho + W\n\nX\n\n\u03c1~q \u03c6\u2212~q.\n\n(1)\n\nq\n~\n\nIn this paper we will imagine that H0 is a Hamiltonian in which effects of interaction have\nbeen taken into account by a mean-field approximation- so that for instance, H0 might be\n4\n\n\fa BCS Hamiltonian with explicit pairing terms. In (1) \u03c1~q =\n\nP\n\n\u2020\nc~\n~k c~\nk\u2212~\nq k\n\nis the density of\n\nelectrons at momentum ~q and \u03c6~q is a purely classical field representing the order parameter\nfluctuations. This quantity is to be averaged over the distribution\n\u0014\nX |\u03c6~q|2 \u0015\nP [\u03c6] = exp \u2212\u03b2\n2S(~q)\n\nand it thus gives rise to an effective, and infinitely retarded (attractive) interaction of the\nform\nVef f (~q) = \u2212W 2 S(~q)\n\nAt first sight, it might appear sufficient average the partition function over P [\u03c6], i.e\nZ\nZ =\nP [\u03c6]Z[\u03c6]\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ[\u03c6] = Tr e\u2212\u03b2H[\u03c6] .\n\n(2)\n\nThis is an annealed average. However, such a scheme allows fermion loop renormalizations\nand non-linear interactions to develop within the interaction lines as illustrated in Fig. 1\n(b). These terms are to be dropped, under the assumptions mentioned above. To ensure\nthis, we must carry out a quenched average over the classical field, which means that we\naverage the Free energy, rather than the partition function\nZ\nF = \u2212T P [\u03c6] log Z[\u03c6]\n\n(3)\n\nThis procedure is implicit to the approach of Sadovskii, and subsequent developments, by\nthe selection of Feynman diagrams containing a single Fermion line. One way to implement\nthe quenched average is to use the N \u2192 0 trick,\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nF = \u2212T lim\nZ[\u03c6]N \u2212 1 .\nP [\u03c6]\nN \u21920\nN\n\n(4)\n\nThe term containing Z[\u03c6]N can be considered as the partition function of N identical replicas\nin the frozen classical field \u03c6. Formally, this is accomplished by introducing N replicas of\nthe fermion fields, labeled by the index \u03bb \u2208 [1, N]. The partition function is then given by\nZ N [\u03c6] = Tr[e\u2212\u03b2H\nwhere\nH (N ) [\u03c6] =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb=1,N\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(N) [\u03c6]\n\n\uf8edHo\u03bb + W\n5\n\n]\n\nX\nq\n~\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03c1\u03bb~q \u03c6\u2212~q\uf8f8 .\n\n(5)\n\n\fis the Hamiltonian of N identical replicas coupled to a single classical field. Diagrammatic\ncontributions to Z[\u03c6]N containing n fermion loops, scale as O(N n ), so that in the N \u2192 0\nlimit, the only terms surviving in the diagrammatic expansion of the Free energy, are those\nwith a single fermion loop, as follows\n\uf8ee \uf8eb\nO(N )\n}|\n\uf8ef 1 \uf8ecz\n\uf8ef \uf8ec\n\u2206F = \u2212T lim \uf8ef \uf8ec\n+\nN \u21920 \uf8f0 N \uf8ed\n\nO(N 2 )\n\n{\n\n+ ...\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nz\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb'\n\n}|\n+\n\n+\n\n\u03bb'\n\u03bb\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n{\n\uf8f7\uf8fa\n\uf8f7\uf8fa\n... \uf8f7\uf8fa ,\n\uf8f8\uf8fb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u2206F = FI \u2212 F0 is the change in the Free energy due to turning on the interactions,\n\nThus the only terms which survive the N \u2192 0 limit are those with a single fermion line\nor loop[26]. In this way, all RPA renormalizations and non-linear interactions between the\nfluctuation fields are eliminated, as follows,\n\"\n\u2206F = \u2212T\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+...\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the replica index has been eliminated from the fermion lines. The advantage of this\napproach is that we can now start to formulate a theory of the pseudo-gap in the language\nof an effective Free energy. This becomes particularly useful when considering the case of a\nsuperconductor with a pseudo-gap.\n\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE ACTION IN THE PSEUDO-GAP MODEL WITH INFINITE\n\nCORRELATION LENGTH\n\nTo illustrate the above approach, we consider a two-dimensional electronic system with\n~ = (\u03c0, \u03c0) as illustrated\na nested Fermi surface spanned by the commensurate wavevector Q\nin Fig. 2.

The class of models we shall discuss\ntake the form\nH = H0 + HI\n\n(10)\n\nwhere H0 is a Hamiltonian which does not scatter between the nested Fermi surfaces and\nHI contains the coupling to the density fluctuation modes. We begin by considering the\nsimple model where\nH0 =\n\nX\n~k\n\nHI = W\n\n\u01eb~k c~\u2020k\u03c3 c~k\u03c3\n\nX\n\nc~\u2020k+~qc~k \u03c6~q,\n\n(11)\n\n~k,~\nq\n\nwhere \u03c6~q is a classical field described by quenched average over the probability distribution\nP [\u03c6] given above. If we denote the effective action by a wavy line, then the Feynman\ndiagrams for the expansion of the Free energy are\n\n7\n\n\f+\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+ + +\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+ + +\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+...\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nHere we have implicitly taken the N \u2192 0 limit of (4), thereby eliminating all polarization\nrenormalizations of the interaction lines. We have used the pseudo-momentum labels \" \u2212 \"\nand \" + \" to denote electrons lying on the \"left\" or \"right\"-hand side of the nested Fermi\nsurface. An essential feature of our derivation is that the pseudo-momentum alternates\nbetween scattering events. (For incommensurate fluctuations, this requirement eliminates\nsome of the diagrams such as the fourth diagram shown above). In the limit of an infinite\ncorrelation length, each interaction line can effectively be replaced by a static modulated\nscattering potential which scatters at the nesting wavevectors.

The most important feature of our derivation above, is\nthe conservation of the pseudo-momentum associated with each nested Fermi surface. This\nderivation can be easily generalized to include pairing (which conserves momentum ) and a\nrestricted class of disorder scattering which scatters between states on the same nested side\nof the Fermi surface. We now examine these two cases in detail\n\nA.\n\nPairing in the presence of a pseudo-gap\n\nTo consider pairing, let us now take\nH0 =\n\nX\n~k\n\n\u01eb~k c~\u2020k\u03c3 c~k\u03c3\n\ni |\u2206|2\nXh\n\u2020 \u2020\n.\n\u2206\u03b3~k c~k\u2191 c\u2212~k\u2193 + H.c. +\n+\ng\n\n(23)\n\n~k\n\nwhere \u03b3~k = cos(kx ) \u2212 cos(ky ) is a d-wave order parameter whose nodes bisect the nested\n\nFermi surfaces. We have included an additional term |\u2206|2 /g to take account of the BCS\n10\n\n\fdecoupling of the pairing interaction. To make the model more interesting, we shall consider\na pseudo-gap with d-wave symmetry,\nHI = W\n\nX\n\n\u03b3~k c~\u2020k+~qc~k \u03c6~q,\n\n~k,~\nq\n\nwhere \u03b3~k = cos(kx ) \u2212 cos(ky ) as before. Since the pairing does not change the momentum\nof particles, the reasoning for a normal state is quickly generalized by using the appropriate\nNambu electron propagators.

The interplay of disorder and pseudo-gap formation\non pairing is of particular interest in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors.\nIn a recent experimental paper, Tallon et al. [18] have shown that the superconducting\ntransition temperature of La \u2212 241 and (Y, Ca) \u2212 123 is much more rapidly suppressed by\ndisorder in underdoped compounds, where a pseudo-gap is present. Tallon et al explained\ntheir results in terms of a phenomenological model involving unitary scattering taking place.\nWe now show how the essential features of their discussion can also be obtained by treating\nthe co-existence of pseudo-gap formation and weak non-magnetic impurity scattering.\nIn the presence of impurity scattering we have to include the additional terms in our\nHamiltonian of the form\nH\u2032 =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n~\n\ne\u2212i(k\u2212k )*Rj Vkk\u2032 c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u2032 \u03c3\n\nj,kk \u2032\u03c3\n\nIn order to apply the methods of the last section, we make the important assumption that impurity potential Vkk\u2032 does not scatter between different sides of the Fermi surface. Such scattering can still transfer electrons across the node, and thus remains severely pair-breaking.\nWith this simplified assumption, the impurity scattering does not renormalize the strength\nof the pseudo-gap potential.\n\n12\n\n\fWe can write now\n\nZ \u221e\n1\n2\n(31)\nd\u03b6e\u2212\u03b6 /2 F [\u03b6, Vkk\u2032 ].\nF =\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nIn this oversimplified model the effect of impurities reduces just to replacing of thin lines to\nthere \"thick\", impurity dressed equivalents in the graphic representation for the two-particle\nGreen's function in our model.\nUsing this result, we can generalize equation (30 ) to obtain\nZ \u221e 2\nX Z \u221e d\u03b6\n2\n1\n\u03b3 2 (\u03c6)\ndk\n\u2212 \u03b62\n\u221a e\n,\n= Tc\n2 \u03c9\u0303 2 + \u01eb2 + \u03b6 2 W 2 (\u03c6)\ng\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nn\nk\nn\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0303n is the usual renormalized Matsubara frequency\n\u03c9\u0303n = \u03c9n + \u0393sign\u03c9n\n\n(33)\n\n2\n\u0393 = \u03c0\u03c1N(0)Vimp\n,\n\n(34)\n\nand \u03c1 is the impurity concentration.\nNotice that the momentum dependence of Wk\u2212Q/2 \u221d \u03b3k , so that in equation (32), the\nfunctions \u03b3(\u03c6) and W (\u03c6) share the same angular dependence around the Fermi surface.

By contrast, the pseudogap suppresses\nsuperconductivity by removing states from around the Fermi energy.\n\n1.0\n\nW 0=0.0\nW 0=1.0\nW 0=1.5\nW 0=2.0\n\nTc/Tc0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u0393/Tc0\n\n1.1\n\n\u03930=0.0\n\u03930=0.3\n\u03930=0.6\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n\nTc/Tc0\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nW/Tc0\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Critical temperature of a superconductor, normalized by the critical temperature of\na pure superconductor without pseudogap Tc0 , vs impurity scattering \u0393 in the presence of the\npseudogap (W is an effective pseudogap width). (b) Critical temperature of a superconductor vs\nthe effective width of the pseudogap for different values of impurity scattering rate \u0393(both W and\n\u0393 are normalized by Tc0 ). These curves were all obtained from a numerical solution of equation\n(36).\n\n14\n\n\fThe theoretical results for the critical temperature dependence on the impurity scattering\nand the pseudogap, obtained by a numerical solution of Eq.(36), can be presented in different\nways. Fig. 3a, for example, shows the variation of the transition temperature with impurity\nscattering rate for a set of different values of the pseudogap. In the limit where the pseudogap\nvanishes, Eq.(36) naturally reverts to the standard Abrikosov-Gorkov mean-field theory. Fig.\n3b shows the dependence of the critical temperature on the pseudogap width for different\nratios \u03930 \u2261 \u0393/Tc0 . These figures illustrate how both the pseudogap and impurity scattering\nsuppress the superconductivity.\nTo illustrate this approach we now use it to develop a phenomenology for the cuprate\nphase diagram (Fig.4). We consider a model, in which the bare superconducting transition\ntemperature is a linear function of doping x, vanishing at x = 0.3 and the pseudogap is a\nrapidly reducing function of x, which vanishes at x = 0.19. The effect of the pseudogap\nis to suppress superconductivity at low doping, leading to a maximum in the transition\ntemperature in the vicinity of where the pseudogap goes to zero. When disorder is introduced\nthe superconducting region is pushed to higher doping.\n\nIV.\n\nFINITE CORRELATION LENGTH\n\nWe now return to the problem of pseudo-gap formation in the presence of order parameter\nfluctuations with finite correlation length. This problem was originally considered by Lee\nRice and Anderson[1]. Following their approach, we consider Gaussian fluctuations of a\nstatic order parameter with finite correlation length and a real-space correlation function of\nthe form\n\u2032\n\n< \u03a8\u2217 (x)\u03a8(x\u2032 ) >= |\u03a8|2 exp(\u2212\u03ba|x \u2212 x\u2032 |)ei2pF (x\u2212x ) ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere |\u03a8|2 is the mean square fluctuation of the order parameter field and \u03ba is the inverse\ncorrelation length.\nSadovskii [12, 13] later extended the FGM model by considering the effect of multiple\nscattering off order parameter fluctuations. The effect of superconducting pairing was incorporated into the model in recent papers [30]. In the case of infinite correlation length, the\nSadovskii yields an essentially exact solution in one dimension. The Sadovskii approach is\nonly approximate at finite correlation length [15]. For example, Bartosch and Kopietz [17]\nhave shown, that the Dyson singularity in the density of states, which exists for any finite\n15\n\n\f400\n\n\u03930=0.0\n\u03930=0.3\n\u03930=0.6\n\n350\n\nW\n300\n\nT\n\n250\n\nTc0\n\n200\n\n150\n\nTc\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\nx\n\nFIG. 4: Toy phase diagram of cuprates. Here W is the effective energy scale of the pseudogap, for\nsimplicity we assume that this quantity follows a linear dependence on doping W = Wmax (1\u2212x/x1 )\n(x1 \u2243 0.19), while we let the critical temperature of a pure superconductor Tc0 vanish at x \u2243 0.3,\nsince in most experiments superconductivity is not observed for doping value exceeding 0.4\u00f70.5. It\nis clearly seen now how the superconducting area shrinks while the scattering by normal impurities\nincreases (\u0393 is impurity scattering rate (34), normalized by Tc0 ). This phase diagram is surprisingly\nsimilar to the figure 5 of experimental paper [29].\n\nvalue of \u03be, is missed by Sadovskii's algorithm. Nevertheless, the Sadovskii approach seems\nto be justified in 2D case for certain topologies of the Fermi surface [27]. Nevertheless, the\nSadovskii approach appears to provide a remarkably good approximation to the density of\nstates in a pseudogap system with finite correlation length [16, 28].\nTo overcome some of the difficulties encountered in these early treatments, Kopietz has\nrecently suggested a simpler alternative model, which exhibits the same static spatial cor-\n\n16\n\n\frelations originally considered by Lee Rice and Anderson, but which can be treated exactly.\nKopietz's approach considers an order parameter of the form\n\u03a8(x) = Aeiqx\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the amplitude is a Gaussian random variable but the q\u2212 vector is determined by a\nLorentzian distribution, as follows\nP (\u0100, A, q) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0 2 W 2\n\ne\u2212\u0100A/2W\n\n2\n\n(\u03ba2\n\n\u03ba\n+ (q \u2212 Qo )2 )\n\n(39)\n\nwhere we have chosen a one dimensional example, setting Qo = 2pF . The order parameter\ncorrelation function is then\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2032\nh\u03a8 (x)\u03a8(x )i = dAd\u0100dqP (\u0100, A, q)\u0100Aeiq(x\u2212x ) = W 2 e\u2212\u03ba|x\u2212x | eiQ0 (x\u2212x ) .\n\n(40)\n\nFor the commensurate case this recovers the form (37) first assumed by LRA.\nThe Hamiltonian which describes the coupling between the order parameter fluctuations\nand the electrons is given by\nH(\u0100, A, q) =\n\nX\nk\n\n\u01ebk c\u2020k ck +\n\nX\n\n[Ac\u2020k+q/2 ck\u2212q/2 + \u0100c\u2020k\u2212q/2 ck+q/2 ].\n\n(41)\n\nk\n\nUnlike the scattering described in (9), here we have a quenched distribution of critical\nscattering q\u2212vectors, and it is this feature that gives rise to the finite correlation length. By\nresuming all diagrams associated with scattering off the fluctuating field, Kopietz was able\nto derive the spectral density for this model.\nWe now show how the methods we have developed in the previous sections can be used\nto directly derive the Free energy for this model, from which secondary properties, such as\nthe spectral Green function can also be derived. The starting point for our discussion is the\nFree energy in a given static configuration of the order parameter, given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF (\u0100, A, q) = \u2212T ln Tr e\u2212\u03b2H(\u0100,A,q)\n\n(42)\n\nFollowing our earlier discussion, the Gaussian fluctuations over the static classical fields are\nnow represented by the quenched averaged Free energy\nZ\nF = dAd\u0100dqP (\u0100, A, q)F (\u0100, A, q)\n17\n\n(43)\n\n\fThe integrals over A, \u0100 and q can be carried out analytically (Appendix B) and yield\nthe following result\nF = \u22122T\n\nZ\n\ndxe\u2212x Tr ln[(\u03c9\u0303n )2 + (\u01ebk+Qo/2 )2 + 2xW 2 ],\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0303n = \u03c9n + (vF \u03ba/2)sign\u03c9n . Thus the most important effect of the finite correlation\nlength is to introduce an imaginary scattering term inside the Greens function. Notice that\nthe distribution over gap sizes has become exponential (Rayleigh), rather than Gaussian, as\nit was in the case where Qo = \u03c0 : this is a consequence of having assumed an incommensurate\nQ vector. Thus the essential physics of a finite correlation length manifests itself as an elastic\nimpurity scattering potential.\nVarious extensions of these arguments are possible, such as the extension to two dimensions, the use of a commensurate scattering potential and the introduction of pairing terms,\nbut we shall not pursue them in this paper.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe central idea of this paper, was to point out that a large class of treatments of the\npseudogap problem may be formulated in terms of a quenched average over a distribution of\nstatic classical order parameter fluctuations. We have illustrated this method, showing how\nit can be used to construct the Free energy of the pseudo-gap system, from which mean-field\nequations can be derived. The case of infinite correlation length is easier to handle, but a\nsimplified version of the case with finite correlation length has also been treated.\nThe advantages of this method are that they permit us to begin with the Free energy\nfunctional, rather than working directly with Green functions. Thus we are able to introduce\nsuperconducting pairing into the formalism without having to reconsider a whole class of\ntwo-particle correlation functions[25].\nDespite the utility of the new method, there are a number of important questions that\narise as to its complete validity. There are two obvious weaknesses in the current approach\n\u2022 The method ignores any frequency dependence in the fluctuations. For this reason,\nthe method is only applicable at high temperatures.\n\u2022 A secondary weakness is the assumption that the classical modes are strictly noninteracting. With this widely used assumption, we have shown that the fluctuations\n18\n\n\fbehave as a source of quenched disorder. The equivalence between classical fluctuations\nand quenched disorder only holds when the modes are non-interacting and classical\nBoth weaknesses are clearly issues of time scales. So long as the characteristic time-scale\nof the electrons is longer than the characteristic time scale of the fluctuations, then it is\nreasonable to treat them in the way we have outlined. If by contrast, we are interested\nin situations where the characteristic electron time scales become very large, such as the\nvicinity to a quantum critical point, then we might expect the methods used here to become\ninvalid.\nNevertheless, there are clearly a wide number of applications for this approach. One of\nthe interesting possible applications are transport properties of a pseudogap system, and\nthese are currently under active investigation.\nAcknowledgments We would like to thank J.O.

If we write the electron field in a two-component notation as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nck+q/2\n\uf8f8,\nCk = \uf8ed\nck\u2212q/2\n22\n\n\fthen in the presence of the scattering potential\nHI =\n\nX\n\n[Ac\u2020k+q/2 ck\u2212q/2 + \u0100c\u2020k\u2212q/2 ck+q/2 ]\n\nk\n\nthe corresponding electron Greens function is given by\n\u2020\n\u2212 hCk\u03b1(\u03c4 )Ck\u03b2\n(0)i = G\u03b1\u03b2 (k, \u03c4 )\nX\nG\u03b1\u03b2 (k, \u03c4 ) = T\nG(k, i\u03c9n )e\u2212i\u03c9n \u03c4\n\n(60)\n\nn\n\nwhere\nG(~k, i\u03c9n ) = [i\u03c9n \u2212 \u01ebk+(q/2)\u03c43 \u2212 A\u03c4\u2212 \u2212 \u0100\u03c4+ ]\u22121\nis the inverse propagator of the electron in the pseudogap field. To obtain this expression\nwe have kept scattering between states with k \u223c \u00b1kF , neglecting scattering into high energy\nstates with k \u223c \u00b1(kF + nq). The free energy is then given by\nZ\nZ\n1\ndAd\u0100 \u2212\u0100A/2W 2\nF =\ndq\ne\nF [q, \u0100, A]\n2\n2\n2\u03c0\u2206\n\u03c0(\u03ba + (q \u2212 Qo )2 )\n\n(61)\n\nwhere\nF [q, \u0100, A] = \u2212T Tr ln[\u2212G \u22121 (k, i\u03c9n )]\n\n(62)\n\nTo carry out the Lorentzian integral over q, we first linearize the electron kinetic energy\naround the wavevector q = Qo , writing\nZ\n\u03ba\ndq\nTr ln[i\u03c9n \u2212 \u01ebk+(Qo /2)\u03c43 \u2212 vF (q \u2212 Q0 ) \u2212 A\u03c4\u2212 \u2212 \u0100\u03c4+ ]\n\u2212T\n2\n2\nZ \u03c0 (q \u2212 Q0 ) + \u03ba\ndq \u03ba\nTr ln[i\u03c9n \u2212 \u01ebk+(Qo /2)\u03c43 \u2212 vF q \u2212 A\u03c4\u2212 \u2212 \u0100\u03c4+ ]\n= \u2212T\n\u03c0 q 2 + \u03ba2\n\n(63)\n\nThis Lorentzian momentum integral has two poles in the complex plane at q\u2212Qo = \u00b1i\u03ba. For\n\u03c9n > 0, the poles of the logarithm are in the upper half complex plane, so we complete the\ncontour in the lower half plane, picking up the sole contribution to the pole from q = \u2212i\u03ba.\nFor the opposite sign, i.e. \u03c9n < 0 we complete the contour in the upper half plane. The\nresult of this procedure is\nZ\ndAd\u0100 \u2212\u0100A/2\u22062\nF = \u2212T\ne\nTr ln[i\u03c9\u0303n \u2212 \u01ebk+(Qo /2)\u03c43 \u2212 A\u03c4\u2212 \u2212 \u0100\u03c4+ ],\n2\u03c0\u22062\n\u03c9\u0303n = \u03c9n + (vF \u03ba/2)sign(\u03c9n )\n\n23\n\n(64)\n\n\fshowing that the effect of the finite correlation length is to introduce a damping term into\nthe propagator. We can further simplify this result by writing the the nesting condition\n\u01ebk+Qo /2 = \u2212\u01ebk\u2212Qo /2 as \u01ebk+Qo /2\u03c43 = \u01ebk\u2212Qo /2 \u03c43 , so that\nZ\ndAd\u0100 \u2212\u0100A/2\u22062\ne\nTr ln[i\u03c9\u0303n \u2212 \u01ebk+Qo /2 \u03c43 \u2212 A\u03c4\u2212 \u2212 \u0100\u03c4+ ],\nF = \u2212T\n2\nZ 2\u03c0\u2206\ndAd\u0100 \u2212\u0100A/2\u22062\n= \u22122T\ne\nTr ln[(\u03c9\u0303n )2 + (\u01ebk+Qo /2 )2 + \u0100A],\n2\u03c0\u22062\n\n(65)\n\nTo simplify the Gaussian integral over the pseudo gap amplitude, we simply make the\nchange of variables\nA =\n\u0100 =\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\n2xW ei\u03b8\n2xW e\u2212i\u03b8\n\n(66)\n\nso that\ndxd\u03b8 \u2212x\ndAd\u0100 \u2212\u0100A/2W 2\ne\n=\ne\n2\n2\u03c0W\n2\u03c0\nso that the Free energy becomes\nZ\nF = \u22122T dxe\u2212x Tr ln[(\u03c9\u0303n )2 + (\u01ebk+Qo /2 )2 + 2xW 2 ],\n\n(67)\n\nintroducing a Rayleigh distribution of gap sizes.\n\n[1] P.
