In general the quantum phase transition happens when the degeneracy of\nthe ground states occurs, which cannot be characterized\ncompletely by the pattern of symmetry broken ( order parameters of some kind ). Instead the universal quantum\norder or topological order is needed for the description of\nproperties of the ground state in many-body systems [7].\nRecently the connection between the geometric phase of\nthe ground state and the quantum criticality has been\ndisplayed in spin-chain systems by displaying the singularity of the geometric phase closed to the critical points\n[8, 9]. Moreover in Ref [9] the author showed that the\nscaling behavior of the geometric phase of the ground\nstate near the critical points can also display the universal class of the phase transitions. Many works have been\ndevoted to this interesting issue [10, 11, 12, 13] ( or see\nRef.[14] for a review ).\nAlthough great progresses has been made in the understanding of quantum phase transition from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, an important question is not yet resolved: whether there exists\na universal way to characterize the different phases and\ntheir boundaries. More specifically, could the geometric\nphase of the ground state in many-body systems serve\nthis purpose? This conjecture is natural since the quantum phase transition generally emerges from the degeneracy of the ground state in many-body systems. Geometric phase as a measurement of the curvature of the\nHilbert space, could mark the fantastic changes of the\nground state when degeneracy happens. However the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: cuiht@aynu.edu.cn\n\ncritical point is how to obtain the geometric phase of the\nground state. The earlier method is to impose a local rotation about some special orientations, as has been done\nin [8, 9, 10]. In our own viewpoints, the connection built\nby this method is fragile; the geometric phase is trivial\nwhen the system is symmetrical about this rotation.\nRecently the differential information-geometry analysis of quantum fidelity in many-body systems displayed\nthe intimate correlation between quantum phase transition and the singularity of fidelity between the states\nacross the transition point [12]. In these papers the quantum geometric tensor, which is intimately related to the\ndegeneracy of the ground state, was introduced for the\ndetermination of the fidelity. As shown in these papers,\nthe imaginary part of this tensor actually described the\ncurvature two-form whose holonomy is the Berry phase,\nand the degeneracy of the ground state would induce the\nsingularity of fidelity [12]. However, in our opinion, it\nseems not transparent to directly define the geometric\nphase in this coupling-parameter space since a cyclic evolution may be difficult to construct. Moreover, the explicit expression for the ground state is necessary for the\nconstruction of this tensor, which in general is difficult.\nFurthermore it is also unknown in the case where the degeneracy of the ground state is broken. In Ref. [11], the\nBargmann phase, a generalization of the Berry phase, has\nalso been constructed for detecting the phase transition\nin many-body systems. However the connection between\ndegeneracy of the ground state and the Bargmann phase\nwas unclear in this case since there was a lack of simple\ninterpretational underpinnings for the Bargmann phase\nin terms of physical adiabatic processes [11].\nWith respect to the points stated above, it is urgent to\nfind a popular way for construction of geometric phase\nin many-body systems. For this purpose, a nonlocal operator -the twist operator- is introduced to obtain the\ngeometric phase of the ground state in this paper. Our\ncalculation shows that the geometric phase, decided by\nthe ground-state expectation value of the twist operator,\ncan serve as the quantity to distinguish different phases\n\n\f2\nand boundaries between them, as shown below. The general form for the twist operator can be written as in the\nlattice systems,\n\u03b7 = exp(\n\n2\u03c0i X\nxnx ),\nN x\n\n(1)\n\nin which N is the number of lattice sites, x denotes the\ncoordinates of lattice sites and nx is generally related\nto the physical quantities located at site x, such as the\ntotal spin or charge, or particle number at site x and\nso on. The twist operator was first introduced by Lieb,\nSchultz and Mattis for the proof of gapless excitation in\none-dimensional spin-1/2 chains[15]. Then Resta pointed\nout that its ground state expectation was direct to the\nBerry-phase theory of polarization in strongly correlated\nelectron systems [16]. Moreover Aligia found that the\nground-state expectation value of the twist operator Eq.\n(1) allows one to discriminate conducting from nonconducting phase in the extended quantum systems [17].\nThe vanishing of the ground-state expectation value, i.e.\n\u03b7 = 0, has been shown the ability to detect the boundaries of different valence-bond-solid phases in spin chains\n[18]. However these studies were implemented in some\nspecial examples and a general discussion was absent.\nMoreover since the previous calculations were numerical\nor approximate, the details of \u03b7 adjacent to the phase\ntransition points are unclear. Hence it is of great interest\nto find the exact expression for \u03b7, even for special cases.\nOur paper serves this purpose, and the exact results can\nbe found for a special case.\nIt is of great interest to note that the twist operator\n\u03b7 actually creates a wave-like excitation since it rotates\nall the particles with a relative angle between the neighboring lattices 2\u03c0/N [15]. Under the large N limit the\nground state has an adiabatic variation, and its groundstate expectation value is exactly a geometric factor, of\nwhich an argument is the geometric phase. Applying \u03b7 to\nthe unique ground state, one obtains a low-lying excited\nstate. The important quantity is the overlap between the\nground state and this excited state, i.e.\nz = hg|\u03b7|gi,\n\n(2)\n\nin which |gi denotes the many-body ground state. In\ngeneral z is a complex number and its argument is just\nthe geometric phase, determined by\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03b3g = Arg[z] = i\nd\u03c6hg(\u03c6)|\u2202\u03c6 |g(\u03c6)i,\n(3)\n0\n\nP\nin which |g(\u03c6)i = exp( i\u03c6\nx xn\u0302x )|gi. Since \u03b3g in fact\nN\ncame from the continued deformation of the boundary\ncondition of systems [17] and then slightly related to the\nsymmetry of the Hamiltonian, this construction of the geometric phase is more popular than the previous method.\nAn important character is that \u03b3g is related to the correlation functions for the ground state, and numerical\nevaluation could be implemented efficiently [16, 17, 18].\n\nIt is an immediate speculation that z and \u03b3g may be\nsingular near the critical points, where the degeneracy of\nthe ground state happens and the macroscopic properties of the system have fantastic changes. However, our\nfindings are more subtle; the exact calculations show an\nunexpected ability for \u03b3g or z to distinguish the different\nphases in many-body systems; one case is that z tends to\nbe zero and then \u03b3g is ill-defined when one approaches the\nphase transition points, in which the degeneracy of the\nground state happens. The other is that \u03b3g has different\nvalues for different phases and displays the singularity at\nthe transition points, where no degeneracy happens. The\nphysical reason, as shown in the following discussions, is\ndirectly related to the energy gap above the ground state.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, the exact expression of z and the geometric phase \u03b3g are presented in the two-band model for a special case, in which\nthe ground state is the filled Fermi sea. In Sec. III,\ntwo representative examples are provided for the demonstration of this connection. One is the D-dimensional\nfree-fermion model, in which there are quantum phase\ntransitions originated from the ground-state-energy degeneracy. The other example is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n( SSH ) model, in which the energy gap is non-vanishing\nat the quantum phase transition points and a topological\norder, defined by the geometric phase \u03b3g , provides a clear\ndescription of the phase diagram for this model.\nII.\n\nTWO-BAND MODEL\n\nConsider the one-dimensional (1D) translational invariant Hamiltonian with two bands separated by a finite\ngap [19, 20],\nX\nH=\n(4)\nc\u2020x Hx,x\u2032 cx\u2032 ,\nx,x\u2032\n\n(\u2020)\n\nT(\u2020)\n\nin which cx = (c+ , c\u2212 )x\ndefines a pair of fermion\nannihilation (creation) operators for each site x, x\u2032 =\n1, 2, . . . , N and the form of cx is decided completely by\nthe Hamiltonian. Hx,x\u2032 is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix and its elements\ncan be determined by the hermiticity of Eq. (4),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA+ B\n\u2032\n(5)\nHx,x =\nC A\u2212 x,x\u2032\nin which A\u00b1,xx\u2032 = A\u2217\u00b1,x\u2032 x and Bx,x\u2032 = Cx\u2217\u2032 ,x . Although\nour discussion is restricted to 1D system in this section,\nit should point out that this situation can be easily generalized to higher dimension systems.\nWithout the loss of generality, it is conventional for\nthe translational invariant system to impose the periodic\nboundary condition. In spite of the simplicity, the Hamiltonian Eq. (4) has a wide range of applications, such as\nthe Bogoliubov- de Gennes Hamiltonian in superconductivity, graphite systems [19]. Applying the Fourier transformation and \u221a\nconsidering\nthe periodic boundary conP\ndition, cx = 1/ N k eikx ck in which k = 2\u03c0n/N with\n\n\f3\nn = 1, 2, . . . , N . Then the Hamiltonian in the momentum\nP\nspace can be written generally as H = k c\u2020k H (k)ck . If\none introduces the four-vector R\u03bc (k)(\u03bc = 0, x, y, z), then\nthe Hamiltonian can be rewritten as,\nXX \u2020\nH=\nck R\u03bc (k)\u03c3\u03bc ck ,\n(6)\n\u03bc\n\nk\n\nin which \u03c30 is a 2\u00d72 unit matrix and \u03c3i (i = x, y, z) is the\nPauli operators. Obviously Eq. (6)\nP can be diagonalized\nby finding the eigenvectors \u03bd\u00b1 of i Ri (k)\u03c3i = R(k) * \u03c3,\nin which the vector R(k) is similar to the Bloch vector for the density operator in the 2 \u00d7 2 Hilbert space\n[21], and furthermore should also satisfy the relation\n(Rx (k), Ry (k)) 6= (0, 0) since in this case one has a trivial\ngeometric phase [22],\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nRx (k) \u2212 iRy (k)\n(7)\n\u03bd\u00b1 = p\n2R(k)(R(k) \u2213 Rz (k)) \u00b1R(k) \u2212 Rz (k)\n\nin which R(k) = |R(k)| and the corresponding eigenvalues are E\u00b1 = R0 (k) \u00b1 Rz (k). Obviously there is a finite\ngap between the two bands since E+ > E\u2212 . The ground\nQ \u2020\n|0ik ,\nstate is defined as the filled Fermi sea |gi = k \u03b2\u2212,k\n\u2020\nin which \u03b2\u2212,k\n= c\u2020k \u03bd\u2212 and |0ik is the vacuum state of\nc\u00b1k .\nNow it is time to determine the geometric phase Eq.\n(3), given by the ground-state expectation value of the\ntwist operator Eq. (2). In this model the twist operator\ncan be expressed explicitly as\n\n\u03b7 = exp(\n\n2\u03c0i X \u2020\nxcx cx ),\nN x\n\n(8)\n\nin which nx = c\u2020x cx = c\u2020+ c+ + c\u2020\u2212 c\u2212 . Seemingly c\u2020x cx\ncould define the particle number at the site x, however\nthe physical meanings for it may be different for different\nsystems, dependent on one's interests; for spin systems\nit may denote the total spin at site x, and for electron\nsystems it may also denote the total charge number at\nsite x. The geometric phases in the both situations have\nbeen defined respectively as the spin Berry phase and the\ncharge Berry phase, which have extensive applications\nin determining the phase diagram in strongly correlated\nelectron systems [23].\nIt is a crucial step to determine z. First with the periodic boundary condition, one can rewrite \u03b7 in the moment space\n\u03b7 = exp(\u2212\n\n2\u03c0 X \u2020\nck \u2202k ck ).\nN\n\n(9)\n\nk\n\nNow, introduce the new fermion operators\n\u2020\n\u03b2\u00b1,k = \u03bd\u00b1\nck ,\n\n(10)\n\nin which \u03bd\u00b1 is defined in Eq. (7) and both of \u03b2\u00b1,k satisfy\nthe anti-commutative relation. Then the ground state is\n\ndefined as the filled Fermi sea |gi =\ntute Eq. (10) into Eq. (9)\n\nQ\n\nk\n\n\u2020\n\u03b2\u2212,k\n|0ik . Substi-\n\n2\u03c0 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(\u03b2 M\u03b2k + \u03b2\u2212,k\n\u2202k \u03b2\u2212,k + \u03b2+,k\n\u2202k \u03b2+,k )],\nN k\nk\n(11)\nin which \u03b2k = (\u03b2\u2212,k , \u03b2+,k )T and\n\u0013\n\u0012\nK\u2032 K\n,\n(12)\nM=\n\u2212K \u2217 K \u2032\u2217\n\u03b7=\n\nY\n\nexp[\u2212\n\nwhere\nRz (k)\nRy (k)\n, \u03b3k = arctan\nR(k)\nRx (k)\n\u03b8\nk\nK \u2032 = \u2212i sin2 \u2202k \u03b3k\n2\ni\u03b3k\ne\n(\u2202k \u03b8k + i sin \u03b8k \u2202k \u03b3k )\nK =\n2\n\ncos \u03b8k =\n\n(13)\n\nThe last two terms in Eq. (11) precludes the further\nexact calculations. An important case is that if Ry (k) =\n\u2212Ry (\u2212k), one then can properly choose \u03bd\u00b1 so that the\nnew Fermi operator \u03b2\u00b1,k can be converted into each other\nby exchanging k \u2194 \u2212k. Then the terms in Eq. (11),\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03b2\u2212,k\n\u2202k \u03b2\u2212,k , \u03b2+,k\n\u2202k \u03b2+,k can cancel each other.

Although the exact results can be obtained only for this special case, some different connections between the geometric phase \u03b3g or z and quantum\nphase transitions are disclosed, as shown in the following\ncalculations.\nIII.\n\nEXEMPLIFICATIONS\n\nIn this section two representative models are presented\nto display the distinguished characteristics of \u03b3g or z\nfor the determination of the phase diagram in manybody systems. One is the D-dimensional free-fermion\nmodel, in which the quantum phase transition is originated from the degeneracy of the ground-state energy\n[24]. The other is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,\nin which the quantum phase transition happens with the\nnon-vanishing energy gap above the ground state [19].\n\n\f4\nIt is obvious that these examples include two important\ncases of quantum phase transition; one is the degeneracy\nof the ground-state energy, whereas not for the other.\nMoreover the both models are exactly solvable.\n\n1.0 (a)\n\n0.5\n\nA.\n\nD-dimensional free-fermion model\nz\n\nThe Hamiltonian is read as\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\n[ci cj \u2212 \u03b3(c\u2020i c\u2020j + h.c.)] \u2212 2\u03bb\nci ci ,\nH=\nhi,ji\n\n0.0\n\n(16)\n\nD=1\n\n-0.5\n\nN=11\n\ni\n\nin which hi, ji denotes the nearest-neighbor lattice sites\nand ci is the fermion operator. This Hamiltonian, first\nintroduced in Ref.[24], depicts the hopping and pairing\nbetween nearest-neighbor lattice sites, in which \u03bb is the\nchemical potential and \u03b3 is the pairing potential. Eq.(16)\ncould be considered as a D-dimensional generalization of\none-dimensional spin-1/2 XY model. However for the\nD > 1 case, this model shows some novel phase characteristics [24].\nEq. (16) can be resolved exactly by transforming into\nmoment space with periodic boundary condition. Wiht\nthe help of the Bogoliubov transformation [24], one has\nX\nH=\n2\u039bk \u03b7k\u2020 \u03b7k + const.\n(17)\n\nN=55\nN=1001\n\n-1.0\n\n0\n\nk\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\nz\n0.0\nD=2\n2\n\nN=11\n\nk\n\np\nPD\nin which \u039bk = t2k + \u22062k , tk =\n\u03b1=1 cos k\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb and\nPD\n\u2206k = \u03b3 \u03b1=1 sin k\u03b1 . The phase diagram can be determined based on the gapless excitation \u039bk = 0 [24].\nFor D = 1, which corresponds to the one dimensional\nspin-1/2 XY model, the energy gap above the ground\nstate is non-vanishing except at \u03bbc = 1 for \u03b3 6= 0, where\na second-order quantum phase transition occurs. For\n\u03b3 = 0 the energy of the ground state is degenerate in\nthe region |\u03bb| \u2264 1 and the transition occurs at \u03bb = \u00b11.\nWhen D = 2, the phases diagram should be identified\nwith respect to two different situations; for \u03b3 = 0, the\ndegeneracy of the ground state occurs when \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2],\nwhereas the gap above the ground state is non-vanishing\nfor \u03bb > 2. However for \u03b3 6= 0 three different phases can\nbe identified as \u03bb = 0, \u03bb \u2208 (0, 2] and \u03bb > 2. The first\ntwo phases correspond to case that the energy gap for\nthe ground state vanishes, whereas not for \u03bb > 2. One\nshould note that \u03b3 = 0 means a well-defined Fermi surface with kx = ky \u00b1 \u03c0, whose symmetry is lowered by the\npresence of \u03b3 terms. For D = 3 two phases can be identified as \u03bb \u2208 [0, 3] with the vanishing energy gap above\nthe ground state and \u03bb > 3 with a non-vanishing energy\ngap above ground state. In a word the critical points can\nbe identified as \u03bbc = D(D = 1, 2, 3) for any anisotropy\nof \u03b3, and \u03bb = 0 for D = 2 with \u03b3 > 0.\nDefining the fermion-pair operator ci = (c, c\u2020 )Ti and\ntransforming the system into moment space, one then\nobtain\n\u0013\nP\nX \u2020 \u0012 \u03bb \u2212 P cos k\n\u2212i\u03b3 P\u03b1 sin k\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nP\nH=\nck\nck (18)\ni\u03b3 \u03b1 sin k\u03b1 \u2212\u03bb + \u03b1 cos k\u03b1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nN=101\n\n2\n\n-0.5\n\nN=201\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(c)\n\n2\n\n3\n\nD=3\n\n-5\n\n4.0x10\n\n3\n\n0.10\n\nN=11\n\n3\n\nN=51\n-5\n\n2.0x10\n\nz 0.05\n0.0\n3.0\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n3.5\n\n1\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: ( Color online ) The ground-state expectation value\nof twist operator z for the D-dimensional free-fermion model\nvs the parameter \u03bb.

We have chosen \u03b3 = 1 for\nall plots.\n\nThe schematic drawing of z for D = 1, 2, 3 have been\npresented in Figs. 1, in which we have chosen \u03b3 = 1 for\nspecification. Some different characters can be found in\nthe figures [25].\nD = 1. It is the well-known one-dimensional XY\nmodel for this case, in which there is a quantum phase\ntransition at \u03bb = 1 because of the degeneracy of the\n\nground-state energy. z are plotted with \u03bb respectively\nin Fig. 1 (a). It is obvious that z has an dropping and\nthen an abrupt increment when one approaches the phase\ntransition point \u03bbc = 1. Moreover our calculation shows\nthat z tends to be zero with \u03bb \u2192 1 as shown in Fig. 2\n(b), and at exact \u03bbc = 1 z tends to be 1 with the increase\nof the lattice site number as shown in Fig. 2 (a) [26]. \u03b3g\nhave also been plotted in Fig. 2 (c), in which a rapid\noscillation happens closed to \u03bbc = 1. These phenomena\nmean that \u03b3g is ill-defined closed to \u03bb = 1 and has an\nabrupt change at the phase transition point. Since the\nenergy gap vanished only at \u03bbc = 1, the singularity of \u03b3g\nand z would be directly related to the degeneracy of the\nground state energy. It also hints that one could mark\nthe transition point by detecting the point where z = 0.\nD = 2. With the increment of dimensionality, the\nsituation becomes more complex. We have plotted z in\nFig. 1 (b). It is obvious that two different regions can\nbe identified as \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2] in which z is disordered, and\n\u03bb > 2 in which z is an increasing function of \u03bb. With respect that the disappearance of the energy gap above the\nground state happens when \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2], z presents a clear\nidentification of the phase diagram. It is a reasonable\n\n\f6\nspeculation from Fig. 1 (b) that z may tend to be zero\nunder the thermodynamic limit when \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2]. Then \u03b3g\nis under thermodynamic limit\n(\nundetermined, \u03bb \u2264 2\n\u03b3g =\n(21)\n0,\n\u03bb > 2.\n\nB.\n\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model\n\nAnother example is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nmodel, which is also exactly solvable.

There is a critical point at \u03c6 = 0 ,which divides\nthe ground states into two different types. One should\npoint out that SSH has a gaped excitation for any \u03c6 \u2208\n[\u22121, 1] and the quantum phase transition comes from the\nexcitation of the boundary states[20].\nOne can find from the following calculation that \u03b3g\ncan discriminate the two phases and the boundary between them. Defining cx = (cl , cl+1 )T , the Hamiltonian\nbecomes\nN\nX\n\n\u0013\n0\n\u2212(1 + \u03c6)\ncx\n\u2212(1 + \u03c6)\n0\nx=1\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n0\n0\n\u2020\ncx+1 + h.c.\n+ cx\n\u22121 + \u03c6 0\n\nH =\nt(\u22121 + (\u22121)l \u03c6l )(c\u2020l cl+1 + h.c.),\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n|z|\n\nOur calculation also shows that z tends to be zero with\nthe increment of N at the exact transition point \u03bbc = 2,\nas shown in Fig. 3. Similar to the case of D = 1, it may\nbe desirable to find the point z = 0 as a way of detecting\nthe phase transition.\nD = 3. This case is very similar to that of D = 2,\nexcept the phase transition happens at \u03bbc = 3. z has\nbeen shown in Fig. 1 (c). However in this case z seems\nunlikely to detect the phase transition since the data in\nthe figure has a smoothing changes at the phase transition point for large N , as shown in the inset of Fig. 1\n(c). Only for N = 113 , there is an abrupt changs of z\nnear to the phase transition point. One should note that\nz tends to be zero when \u03bb \u2208 [0, 3], in which the energy\ngap above the ground state disappears.\nFrom the discussions above, one can note the great impact of the degeneracy of the ground-state energy on the\ngeometric phase \u03b3g or z; The degeneracy of the groundstate energy leads to z = 0 or the ill-defined \u03b3g . However,\nthis conclusion would not be made until the next example is studied in which the energy gap above the ground\nstate does not disappear. It is interesting to give a further discussion of the geometric phase in this nontrivial\ncase.\nUnfortunately Eq. (20) seems unsuccessful in characterizing the transitions for \u03b3 = 0 (the tight-binding\nmodel) since\nP in this case K\u03bc is completely undetermined\nwhen \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1 cos k\u03b1 = 0. With respect to Eqs. (16) and\nP\nP\n(8), it means that [H, \u03b7] = 0 since [ hi,ji c\u2020i cj , i c\u2020i ci ] =\n0 in this special case. Hence our discussion excludes this\nspecial situation since one has trivial results. One should\nnote that the phase of \u03bb = 0 with \u03b3 > 0 in D = 2 also\ncannot be identified by z since the transition comes from\nthe deformation of the Fermi surface instead of the degeneracy of the ground state.\n\n1\n\nc\u2020x\n\n\u0012\n\n(23)\n\nImposing the periodic boundary condition and Fourier\n\n\f7\nvalue of the twist operator, and the degeneracy of the\ntransformation, we then have\nground state in many-body systems.

(16) is spatially isotropic, it has no difference\nfor z\u03bc (\u03bc = 1 . . . D) with D > 1 and these plottings are\nchosen for z1 .\n[26] The indetermination of K\u03bc when \u03bb = 1, k\u03b1 = 0 can be\nresolvable by L'Hospital rule. Our calculation shows that\nK\u03bc is 0 for this case. For D = 2, 3, the similar calculations\nare applied.\n[27] A. Heeger, S. Kivelson, J. R. Schrieffer, W. P. Su, Rev.\nMod.
