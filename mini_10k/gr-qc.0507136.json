Petrov\n\narXiv:gr-qc/0507136v1 29 Jul 2005\n\nInstitute for High Energy Physics, 142200, Protvino, Russia\n\n\u2022 The history of the equations of gravitational field is of particular interest because they are\nrelated to two famous names: Albert Einstein and David Hilbert, and because the circumstances of\ntheir invention bear sometimes almost detective character.\nOne of the early references is the book \"Einstein, Hilbert and the Theory of Gravitation\" by a\nrenowned historian of science J. Mehra [1], where the great role of Hilbert was showed very clear.\nSuch view was strengthened in 1978 when the correspondence between Einstein and Hilbert was\npublished, from which followed that Hilbert informed Einstein on the gravitational field equations\nin a letter before his formal publication [2].\nThe opinion, shared by many physicists, was that it was Hilbert who possessed an undoubtful\npriority [3].\n\u2022 However, in 1997 a new sensation shaked just established opinion: the authors of a short\narticle in \"Science\" [4] argued on the basis of the first proofs of the Hilbert paper on the gravitational equations, digged up from the Hilbert archive, that Hilbert had no correct, generally\ncovariant equation before Einstein. Moreover, the authors of [4] transparently alluded that\nHilbert \"borrowed\" some decisive formulae from Einstein! And even that Hilbert tried to hide such\nan appropriation with help of deliberately wrong dating of his article.\nSuch an accusation would seriously undermine the image of David Hilbert from the ethical side,\nand was in a sharp contrast to all what was known about his personality.\n\u2022 On the other hand the very personality of Einstein is by no means irreproachable. Take, for\ninstance, the case of the relativity theory. So, counter-reaction to paper [4] followed.\nOne of the first was the book by C.J. Bjerknes [5], well documented and with a rich bibliography,\nin which the conclusions of paper [4] were contested. This was based on the correspondence between\nEinstein and Hilbert and an important fact that the proofs of Hilbert's paper - the main evidence\nof the authors of [4] against Hilbert - were mutilated with some part of proofs cutted off.\nThis fact was mentioned for the first time, but without a due evaluation, in Ref. [6]. In book [5] it\nwas mentioned that F. Winterberg assumed that the explicit form of the gravitational field could be\nfairly contained in the cutted off parts of the proofs. This seriously undermined the main argument\nof the authors [4] against Hilbert1 .\n\u2022 In ref. [9] the question was considered in detail with analysis of the Hilbert and Einstein\npapers.\nHere I will reproduce only one simple reason we used to reject one of the main accusation of\nthe authors [4] against Hilbert, namely: \"...knowledge of Einstein's result may have been crucial to\nHilbert's introduction of the trace term into his field equations\".\nThus, according to the authors of [4], Hilbert's equations\n\u221a\n\u03b4 gH\n= 0,\n(\u2217)\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n\nAfterwards this consideration was published [7], and, finally, the book [8] appeared in which D. Wuensch gave a\nthorough analysis of the mutilated proofs and other relevant documents with a conclusion: Hilbert knew the explicit\nform of the gravitational equations, they contended in the proofs and the latter were deliberately mutilated in order\nto falsify the historical truth. - Note added to proof.\n\n185\n\n\fwhere H is the sum of the gravitational and material lagrangians, g \u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor with the\ndeterminant \u2212g, are incomplete and need some ad hoc \"introduction\" of additional terms (\"trace\nterm\"). This \"discovery\" of the authors of paper [4] clearly demonstrates their professional inconsistency: they must be never tried to calculate the variational derivative (*) themselves! Otherwise\nthey would quickly saw that the \"crucial\" trace term is safely contained in Eq.(*).\nOther mistakes of the authors of paper [4] where analysed in our paper [9].\nOne thing has to be clear. At the very moment when Hilbert equated the gravitational\npart of the lagrangean to the scalar Riemannian curvature the whole game was over.\nAll the rest was the matter of almost routine calculations, though one has to mention that\nHilbert managed to get, in his paper [10] some very important results (\"Bianchi identity\"). All\ndetailes are given in [9].\nSo, we conclude that an unfair attack of the authors of ref. [4] against Hilbert's originality in\nderiving the gravitaional field equations is completely and shamefully failed.\n\u2022 Now, what about Einstein? In ref. [9], there was admitted that Einstein could derive the\ngravitational field equations [11] independently of Hilbert.\nThe main evidence, if to be as loyal as possible to Einstein, is his assertion, made by him in the\nletter to Hilbert of 18 November 1915: \"The system you furnish agrees - as far as I can - exactly\nwith what I found in the last few weeks and presented to the Academy\" [2].\nThat is, Einstein, in this letter, acknowledged receiving the Hilbert equations of the gravitational\nfield and informed him that his, Einstein's, equations are essentially the same.\nBut we know all papers by Einstein presented to the Academy \"in the last few weeks\", including\nthe paper of the 18 November - they all are still wrong and do not contain the trace term. One has\nto concede that Einstein had by 18 November 1915 the correct equations but preferred to publish\nthe wrong ones up to 25 November! In principle this is possible, but...\nWe also have to mention the paper by Einstein of 18 November 1915 [12] where he claimed the\nsuccessful test of his (wrong!) theory in obtaining the correct result for the Mercury perihelion.\nF. Winterberg (as cited in ref. [5]) draw the attention to the fact that if Einstein would really follow\nhis equations as they were described in his paper of 18 November, he would obtain the result twice\nlarger than the correct one. Nonetheless, his final result was correct! Further interesting details of\nthis story can be found in [5].\n\u2022 What is our conclusion? We still keep the opinion expressed in [9]: the gravitational equation\nhas to be named as the \"Einstein\u2013Hilbert equation\". The reason is that it was Einstein who\nposed the problem to find out the equation in which the energy-momentum tensor is a source\nfor gravitational potentials [13]. Hilbert had found such an equation. Einstein derived it, quite\nprobably, later in his own way.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. Mehra. Einstein, Hilbert and the Theory of Gravitation.\nD. Reidel.
