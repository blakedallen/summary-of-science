We consider tiling models defined as projections\nfrom a higher D-dimensional lattice into a lower d-dimensional physical space. For example, 10-fold symmetric tilings\nmay be projected from D = 5 into d = 2, and icosahedral tilings may be projected from D = 6 into d = 3. Figure 1\ndisplays examples of tilings constructed as projections from D-dimensional simple cubic lattices into d = 2-dimensional\nphysical space. The difference between the higher dimension D and the tiling dimension d is called the codimension.\nAn important unsolved problem is understanding the interactions among tiles that may favor particular tile arrangements over others. The suggestion by Elser4 that random tilings spontaneously exhibit quasiperiodicity, created\na subfield within the area of tiling theory5 . It was shown6 , for at least one atomistic model quasicrystal6,7 , that\nquasicrystalline order emerges with random tiling, rather than Penrose-like, order. The best description for real\nquasicrystalline materials remains an open problem, depending whether one assumes that energetic interactions favor\nquasiperiodicity8 or that entropy stabilizes the quasicrystal structure at high temperatures5,6,9 .\nIn addition to their role in the theory of quasicrystals, random tiling models appear in a number of other interesting\nscientific contexts. Their combinatorial properties, for example their relationship to generalized partitions10,11,12 make\nthem interesting models for study within pure mathematics13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 . Some random tiling models provide\nexamples of exactly solvable models21,22,23 of interest within statistical mechanics. We note a relationship with\nalgorithms for sorting lists24,25 . Random tiling models have also been proposed as models for elastic membranes11,26 .\nThe random tiling theory of quasicrystals focuses on two important properties: The tiling entropy contributes to the\nconfigurational entropy of the quasicrystal, reducing its free energy and enhancing thermodynamic stability against\n\nFIG. 1: Examples of free boundary d = 2 tilings with D = 3, 5, 7 and 9.\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: d = 2 strain-free rhombus tiling entropies.\nD 2\n3\n4\n5\n\u221e\n\u03c3 0 0.323 0.434 0.481 0.568\n\nother competing phases9 ; Variation of the entropy with average phason strain defines the phason elastic constants.\nTable I summarizes existing data on the configurational entropies of d = 2 rhombus tilings, showing a trend of\nmonotonic increase with D.

While these methods prove successful at calculating quantitative values\nfor entropy and elastic constants, they are not always easy to implement, and they often do not enhance our intuitive\nand qualitative understanding of the problem. The technique of mean-field theory29 in statistical mechanics provides\nan approximation that can be analytically simple to implement and can provide a direct link between quantitative\ncalculation and our qualitative picture of the physics of the problem. Mean-field theory often becomes exact in certain\nlimits, such as the limit of infinite dimension. A mean-field theory for random tilings has never been precisely defined.\nThe search for an analogue of mean-field theory applicable to random tilings motivates our study of random tiling\nmodels with high rotational symmetry. We anticipate5 that the infinite D limit may prove easier to analyze than\nspecific finite values of D. Experience gained in the study of this limit may later be transfered back to the finite D\nvalues of greatest physical interest. Furthermore, a study of D dependence of entropy or elastic constants might in itself\nyield qualitative understanding of the values of entropy and elastic constants for small D. Other researchers30,31,32\nhave studied deterministic quasiperiodic tilings of arbitrary rotational symmetry, but have considered neither the high\nsymmetry limit nor the case of random tilings.\nWe mention, in addition, that high symmetry tilings are good candidates of models for topologically disordered\ngraphs, different from the usual random graphs33 because the coordination number of a vertex is a random variable,\nwith algebraically decreasing long-range correlations. Quantum diffusion on such tilings has recently been studied by\nVidal et al. and was found to exhibit an interesting diffusive behavior34 . These tilings could even prove interesting\nas models for structural glasses.\nA word of caution should be given on the title referring to \"high symmetry\" tilings. In two dimensions, this\nstatement is unambiguous owing to the possibility of generating tilings whose Fourier spectrum will display point\nsymmetries of arbitrary order. In three dimensions however, the highest point group symmetry, the icosahedral one\nof order 120, is already reached with codimension 3 tilings. \"High symmetry\", in three and higher dimensions, has\ntherefore a less formal meaning in our description. For a given tiling in dimension d, we can map the whole set of\nedge orientations onto points on a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional hypersphere. As D increases, these representative points cover\nmore and more densely the hypersphere, approaching, but never meeting, the highest continuous point symmetry of\nthe hypersphere itself. This is what is meant by \"high symmetry\" in the title.\nTwo previous papers25,35 presented initial studies of this problem. The first paper proposed an upper bound on\nthe entropy in the limit of large D and discussed problems associated with the thermodynamic limit of tiling models.\nThe second one35 presented a preliminary mean-field approach of the entropy calculation. In the present paper we\nexplain the previous work in greater detail. In addition, we inspect spatial correlations and phason elasticity. All\ntilings considered in this paper are free boundary tilings (see section II). Fixed boundary tilings are analyzed by\ncomputer simulation in the following paper36 . Table III summarizes the available estimates of the large D entropy.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: We begin in section II with definitions and concepts that apply generally\nto random tiling models. Then, in section III we describe our mean-field theory of two-dimensional tilings of high\nrotational symmetry. We start with an upper bound (section III 1) then a more accurate estimate (section III 2) based\non path counting arguments. We investigate the nature of spatial correlations in section III 3 followed by consideration\non finite D corrections. Section IV tackles de Bruijn line interactions and phason elasticity. Tilings of dimension\nd 6= 2 are examined in section V.\n\n\f3\nTABLE III: Entropy estimates in the large D limit.\nValue\n0.998\n0.693\n0.6\n0.598\n0.568\n0.231\n\nMethod\nReference\nRigorous upper bound\n[24 ]\nConjectured upper bound upper bound eq.

In the present\npaper, the tiles are d-dimensional rhombohedra, which we will generically call \"rhombi\" in the following.\nTiling systems can have different boundary conditions, such as free, fixed or periodic ones. For example, the tilings\nin figure 1 illustrate free boundary tilings of various rotational symmetries. The free boundary thermodynamic limit\nis taken as follows: Consider all tilings that cover a circular region of space R (whose area will tend towards infinity).\nFor a given R, tilings contain fixed numbers of tiles of each type, with relative frequencies governed by the average\ncomposition of the tiling we wish to study. The total number of tiles is chosen so they encompass a total area slightly\nlarger than area of the region R that must be covered. Every tile must intersect R or share an edge with a tile that\ndoes so. This ensures a reasonably compact tiling and gives us needed control over the composition.\nIt is generally supposed that free and periodic boundary tilings have the same entropies (provided their compositions\nmatch) at the thermodynamic limit. But fixed boundary tilings display a less usual behavior: such boundaries have\nsuch a macroscopic effect on tilings that their entropy per tile at the infinite size limit can be strictly smaller than\nthe free boundary one. For example, in the case of \"hexagonal\" tilings of 60\u25e6 rhombi (D = 3 and d = 2), when all\norientations of rhombi occur with equal probability, the fixed boundary entropy per tile \u03c3f ixed = 0.261 (37 ) while the\nfree boundary entropy per tile \u03c3f ree = 0.323 (38 ). In addition to a qualitative argument by Elser37 , this phenomenon\nhas more recently been rigorously explained and described17,18,39 : the local entropy density can be calculated in any\npoint of the tiling; it displays a gradient between the regions near the boundary, where the entropy is vanishing, and\nthe central region, where the entropy is a free boundary one. In other words, it is only at the very center of the tiling\nthat the tiling loses the influence of the boundary.\n1.\n\nMembrane representation of tilings\n\nHere, we briefly recall how tilings are conveniently coded by (mono-valued) functions from the \"physical real space\"\nto the \"perpendicular\" space.\nRhombic tiles can be considered as the projections onto a d-dimensional space of the d-dimensional faces of a\nhypercube in a space of higher dimension D. Conversely, any rhombic tiling in the d-dimensional space can be \"lifted\"\nto a d-dimensional continuous membrane embedded in the Z D hypercubic lattice. When this membrane is projected\nback into d-dimensional space, the facets of the D-dimensional lattice project precisely onto the d-dimensional rhombic\ntiles. Such a membrane is said to be continuous and directed to emphasize the fact that, when projected, is does\nnot exhibit any gaps or overlaps. We say that we are dealing with D \u2192 d membranes or tilings. This membrane\nrepresentation of rhombus tilings5,11,26,39 is a useful tool in quasicrystal science.\nNotation related to the D-dimensional geometry and projection is described in appendix A. Let (\u00eai )i=1,...,D denote\nk\nthe basis of the Z D hypercubic lattice and denote by \u00eai the normalized projection of \u00eai on the d-dimensional space\nk\nwhere tilings lie. The projection direction is (arbitrarily) chosen so that the basis vectors \u00eai all have equal length and\nangles that are multiples of \u03c0/D (see appendix A). We call this collection of vectors a regular fan.\nk\nk k\nA rhombic tile has d edge orientations {\u00eai , \u00eaj , * * * , \u00eak } with (1 \u2264 i < j < * * * < k \u2264 D). We denote this tile species\n\u0010 \u0011\nas Tij***k . Note that there are D\ndifferent species of tiles. Examples of D \u2192 2 tilings are displayed in figure 1. The\nd\nfirst one can be seen as a membrane embedded in a 3-dimensional cubic lattice, as may be more clear in the following\n\n\f4\nfigure 2.\n\nFIG. 2: Three-dimensional image effect. Gray rhombi can be seen as horizontal terraces.\n\nSuch random tilings have internal degrees of freedom, the so-called localized phason flips, which consist of local\nrearrangements of tiles. Such local flips are displayed in figure 3. In d dimensions, a flip involves d + 1 tiles that fill\na small zonotope40 . Note that in 2 dimensions, the ergodicity of tiling ensembles via elementary flips is proven12,14 ,\nwhereas it is an open question in 3 and more dimensions, even if some significant progress has been achieved recently41 .\nThis local degree of freedom is the source of configurational entropy in random tilings.\n\nFIG. 3: Two examples of elementary flips in 2 and 3 dimensions, involving respectively 3 and 4 rhombic tiles.\n\nA functional representation of these directed membranes will prove useful. Denote the d-dimensional \"physical\"\nor \"real\" space containing the actual tiles by E k = Rd , and the perpendicular (D \u2212 d)-dimensional space by E \u22a5 =\nRD\u2212d . Since membranes representing tilings are directed, they are the graphs of single-valued continuous functions\nh : E k \u2192 E \u22a5 . Such functions h are called the height functions of the corresponding tilings. The detailed construction\nof the spaces E k and E \u22a5 is described in appendix A when d = 2. Executing an elementary flip of vertex v changes the\nvalue of the height function locally at vertex v.\nSince the membranes are embedded in a hypercubic lattice, they are irregular and faceted at on the length scale\nof individual tiles. The local height function h is usually coarse-grained to get a smoother function h\u0304 which closely\ntracks the local function h over long distances but which is nearly insensitive to individual single vertex flips5,11,42 .\nThe function h\u0304 describes a smoothed membrane. Then one defines the phason gradient E = \u2207h\u0304. This (D \u2212 d) \u00d7 d\ndimensional tensor controls the fractions of the different species of tiles.\nThe entropy can be written as a functional of the phason gradient5 . Moreover, the random tiling model hypothesis\nstates that this latter entropy has a unique maximum, corresponding to tile fractions maximizing the symmetry. The\norientation of the real space E is chosen so that the gradient is zero at this maximum, and the model states that the\nentropy density has a quadratic behavior near this maximum:\n\u03c3 = \u03c3max \u2212\n\n1\n\u2207h\u0304 * K * \u2207h\u0304 + o(|\u2207h\u0304|2 ).\n2\n\n(II.1)\n\nBy analogy with an usual elastic theory, the tensor K is called the tensor of phason elastic constants.\nThe best known rhombus tilings of the plane is the Penrose3 tiling, which displays an exact quasiperiodicity. The\nmembrane representation of a Penrose tiling is a flat, horizontal, sheet. The phason strain of this tiling vanishes.\nIn addition, the Penrose tiling is virtually unique (up to translations) because it forbids localized phason flips. The\nrandom tiling hypothesis implies that the most typical tilings in a random tiling ensemble mimic the long-range order\nof the Penrose tiling, while enjoying the entropy of short-range fluctuations.\n\n\f5\nRandom and perfect tilings with vanishing phason strain exhibit the highest symmetry consistent with the projection\nfrom D \u2192 d. In two dimensions, this symmetry includes32 2D-fold rotational symmetry. A given tiling itself generally\nhas no point about which it is invariant under rotations, but two-point and higher correlation functions do exhibit\nthe symmetry. In addition, there are two families of mirror symmetries, denoted \"along\" and \"between\" according to\nk\nthe relation between the mirror plane and the basis vectors \u00eai .\n2.\n\nDe Bruijn dualization and iterative construction of tilings\n\nThe de Bruijn dualization43 provides another representation of random tilings. We present this technique in two\ndimensions and generalize it to higher dimensions when needed.\nDe Bruijn grids43,44,45 are made up of lines, the de Bruijn lines, that are sometimes called worms. These lines are\nmade of adjacent tiles sharing an edge of given orientation. It is always possible to extend these lines through the\nwhole tiling up to a boundary tile. An example is presented in figure 4. Since there are D different edge orientations,\nthere are D different\n\u0010 \u0011de Bruijn families. A rhombic tile corresponds to the intersection of two lines of different families.\nHence there are D\n= D(D \u2212 1)/2 tile species. There are no triple intersections, and lines of a same family never\n2\nintersect, even in an infinite tiling, because no rhombus has four parallel edges.\n\nt\ne^4||\n\nFIG. 4: Iterative process for the construction of D \u2192 2 tilings. Left shows paths on a re-oriented 3 \u2192 2 tiling. Right shows\nthe resulting 4 \u2192 2 tiling. A non-crossing contact between two de Bruijn lines of the same family is emphasized.\n\nThis de Bruijn representation of tilings suggests an iterative construction of D \u2192 2 tilings in terms of directed\nrandom walkers on D \u2212 1 \u2192 2 tilings. The basic idea is illustrated in figure 4. A D \u2212 1 \u2192 2 tiling is sheared to make\nk\nroom for a new de Bruijn line family by taking the vectors \u00eai that initially lie at angles \u03c0i/(D \u2212 1) and replacing\nthem with angles \u03c0i/D (see Fig. 4, left). Next, paths are chosen on the D \u2212 1 \u2192 2 tiling (dark lines in Fig. 4, left).\nk\nThey go from bottom to top, as symbolized by a \"time arrow\" t. These paths must be \"opened\" in the direction \u00eaD\nin order to form de Bruijn lines (shaded in figure 4 right) of the D-th family and therefore a D \u2192 2 tiling. These\npaths are directed in the positive time direction and they do not intersect within the same family. The figure shows\na contact among paths that is not an intersection. Conversely, de Bruijn lines of family D in a D \u2192 2 tiling may be\ncollapsed to directed walks in a D \u2212 1 \u2192 2 tiling. There is thus a one-to-one correspondence between D \u2192 2 tilings\nwith p de Bruijn lines of family D and collections of p non-intersecting walks on D \u2212 1 \u2192 2 tilings.\n3.\n\nGrid parameters, phason strain and tile fractions\n\nIn this subsection, we introduce several macroscopic quantities that characterize a two-dimensional random tiling.\nApart from the phason gradient E previously defined, a tiling can also be characterized at large scale either by the\ntile fractions or by geometric parameters. This subsection also provides the relationships between these quantities\n(II 3 2) as well as useful relations that constrain them (II 3 3).\n\n\f6\n1.\n\nDefinitions\n\nWe now address two macroscopic characterizations of de Bruijn lines, the mean line spacings and orientations, and\nlink these to the phason strain E and the tile fractions nij (the fraction of tiles that are of type Tij ). De Bruijn lines\nof family i are characterized by the mean spacing li between two lines of the family i and the mean angle \u03c6i that\nk\nlines of this family make with their nominal direction . The nominal direction (denoted by \u03b4 i ) is normal to \u00eai (see\nfigure 5). For a maximally symmetric tiling with vanishing phason strain E = 0, rotational symmetry guarantees\nthat the mean line spacing li is independent of the line family i. We shall calculate its common value shortly. The\nstrain-free tiling's mirror symmetries guarantee that each angle \u03c6i = 0. Deviations of li and \u03c6i from their strain-free\nvalues control nonzero values of E and determine the tile fractions nij . By definition, li > 0 and \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03c6i < \u03c0/2.\nk\nFigure 5 represents lines of the i-th family as sequences of tiles Tij , each tile defined by the vector \u00eai and some\nk\nother vector \u00eaj . Let y 0 be the relative position of a given tile in a de Bruijn line, and follow this line in the plane.\nThe position y m \u2212 y 0 of the m-th tile is the sum of the vectors defined by the successive edges of the tiles Tij of the\nk\nk\nline between tile 0 and tile m. These vectors are a priori equal to \u00b1\u00eaj . Therefore we define fj = \u00b1\u00eaj where the sign\nis chosen so that fj * \u03b4 i > 0. For large m, the number of tiles Tij on any typical line is proportional to the tile fraction\nnij . The mean direction of this line is therefore\ndi =\n\nD\nX\n\nnij fj .\n\n(II.2)\n\nj=1\nj6=i\n\nIn general, a random tiling ensemble is completely characterized by {li } and {\u03c6i }. Since D \u2212 2 families of lines must\nbe added to an original square lattice (D = 2) to define a D \u2192 2 tiling we need 2(D \u2212 2) independent macroscopic\nparameters to characterize a tiling: li and \u03c6i for i = 3, 4, . . . , D. Note that 2(D \u2212 2) is precisely the number of\ncoefficients of the global phason gradient E = \u2207h\u0304. By comparison, in reference [42 ], 4 \u2192 2 tilings are characterized\nby 6 tile concentrations dij , and 2 exact relations constrain them. Therefore these tilings are characterized by 4\nindependent parameters, as predicted above.\n\nym\ndi\ne^ ||i u \u03b4i\ni\n\nli\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03b4i\n\ndi\n\nui\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03c6i\n\ny0\n\nFIG. 5: Definition of quantities li \u2013 the mean distance between two neighbor lines of the i-th de Bruijn family \u2013 and \u03c6i \u2013 the\nk\nmean angle that the lines of this family make with \u03b4 i .

Generally speaking,\nthroughout the text, starred quantities will refer to unstrained tilings with E = 0.\nRelation (II.3) is useful because the tile densities are given in a simple fashion by42,46\n\ndij = |mi \u00d7 mj |,\n\n(II.5)\n\nwhere mi (see appendix A) is the parallel space gradient of the ith component of the smoothed membrane hyperspace\ncoordinates. We also define a vector ui for each line family: it is the unit vector along the shortest direction from\none line of the family to the next; it is perpendicular to di . Examining figure 5, if one travels a distance li in the\ndirection ui , then one crosses one de Bruijn line of the family i on average and the ith component of the hyperspace\ncoordinates increases by one on average. In contrast, if one travels any distance in the orthogonal direction di , then\nthe ith component of the hyperspace coordinates remains constant.

Inspecting\n\u2217\neqs. (II.7) and (II.3), we may write nij = C| sin \u03b8ij\n|.

Since tiles of family i have, on\naverage, the same area as tiles of the whole tiling, the above numerical tile fraction is also an area tile fraction. Since\na fraction 2/D of tiles belong to lines of a family and the width of such a line is 1, the mean distance between lines is\nli\u2217 = D/2.\n\n(II.15)\n\n\u2217\nSetting li = li\u2217 and \u03b8ij = \u03b8ij\nfor all i and j in (II.11), we find again in a consistent way E 2 = 0.

We describe a few such constraints here. The\ncondition\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c6i\u22121 \u2212\n\u2264 \u03c6i \u2264 \u03c6i+1 +\n(II.17)\nD\nD\nimposes a certain regularity to the angles \u03c6i as a function of i. This constraint holds because lines of two consecutive\nk\nk\nfamilies i and i + 1 intersect only at a tile Ti,i+1 , with edges \u00eai and \u00eai+1 as displayed in figure 6. The oriented\nangles (di di+1 ) and (\u03b4 i \u03b4 i+1 ) have the same sign. Indeed, were these angles of opposite sign, no tile type could match\nat their intersection. As a consequence (di di+1 ) = (\u03b4 i \u03b4 i+1 ) \u2212 \u03c6i + \u03c6i+1 \u2265 0. Owing to (\u03b4 i \u03b4 i+1 ) = \u03c0/D, one gets\n\u03c6i+1 \u2212 \u03c6i \u2265 \u2212\u03c0/D and condition (II.17) (see figure 6). Such conditions mean that at large D, when one adds a\nnew family of lines in the iterative process, the angle \u03c6D is highly constrained by the pre-existing underlying tiling.\nFor example, if a family i = D is added in a strain-free tiling where \u03c61 = \u03c6D\u22121 = 0, the condition (II.17) reads\n\u2212\u03c0/D \u2264 \u03c6D \u2264 \u03c0/D.\n\u03c6i+1\n\ndi+1\n\n\u03c6i\n\ndi\n\n||\n\nei\n\n||\n\ne i+1\n\n\u03b4i\n\u03b4i+1\n\u03c0D\n\nFIG. 6: Left: Intersection of two lines of two consecutive families i and i + 1. Right: The corresponding directions \u03b4 i , \u03b4 i+1\n(outer thick lines) and di , di+1 (inner thin lines). The vectors di and di+1 are constrained by the condition (di di+1 ) > 0,\nwhich constrains in turn the angles \u03c6i and \u03c6i+1 .\n\nSince amongst the 2D parameters {li } and {\u03c6i }, only 2(D \u2212 2) are independent, there exist 4 relations between\nthem. Of these four we will need this identity\nX 1\n\u2217\n| sin \u03b8ij || sin \u03b8ij\n|=1\nl\nl\ni<j i j\n\n(II.18)\n\nwhich\nreflects the fact that the total contribution of tile areas per unit area is by definition equal to 1. In other words,\nP\n\u2217\nd\ni<j ij | sin \u03b8ij | = 1 where dij is given by eq. (II.7). This relation can also be derived from eq. (II.4).\nIn the large D limit we have infinitely many tile species, so we expect that all nij \u2192 0. When taking the large D\nlimit we wish to ensure that no finite fraction of tile species dominates, with tile fractions that are large compared\nto the remainder. Indeed, such a tiling would essentially be a finite D tiling, with a negligible number of defect tiles\n\n\f9\nadded in. Thus we introduce the notion of \"bounded\" relative fractions of tiles, which proves useful in discussing\nlarge D phason elastic constants. Consider tilings in which all tile fractions tend to 0 as D \u2192 \u221e, all vanishing at the\nsame rate. Specifically, assume there exists a > 0 such that\nnij \u2265 a n\u2217ij\n\n(II.19)\n\nholds uniformly for all i and j, which ensures that all tile fractions have the same order of magnitude as in strain-free\ntilings. Owing to eq. (II.4), we could alternatively assume that there exists b > 0 such that\ndij \u2265 b d\u2217ij .\n\n(II.20)\n\nIndeed, k<l nkl = 1 thus k<l nkl sin |\u03c0(l \u2212 k)/D| \u2264 1 and dij \u2265 nij . Furthermore nij \u2265 a n\u2217ij = \u03c0a/4 d\u2217ij and\nb = \u03c0a/4.\nIn addition, conditions (II.19) or (II.20) constrain the distances li and the angles \u03b8ij so that\nP\n\nP\n\nli \u2264 c li\u2217\n\n(II.21)\n\n\u2217\n| sin \u03b8ij | \u2265 d | sin \u03b8ij\n|\n\n(II.22)\n\nwhere c > 0 is a finite constant, and\n\nwith d > 0. Indeed, these two conditions together with eq. (II.7) imply dij \u2265 (d/c2 )d\u2217ij .\nComparable constraints can be stated in the membrane viewpoint, in which case the constraints appear as extreme\nallowed values of E. Using (II.11) and constraint (II.21), one finds that the phason strain is vanishingly small at large\nD,\nE2 \u2264\n\nConst.\n.\nD\n\n(II.23)\n\nThe only way to achieve finite strain at large D is to allow a finite subset of the tile species to dominate. This large\nD behavior is related to our choice of normalizations of basis vectors both in E \u22a5 and in E k . Our choice is consistent\nwith current practice for finite D tilings.\nIII.\n\nMEAN-FIELD THEORY, CORRELATIONS AND FINITE D CORRECTIONS\n\nThis section applies the iterative construction of section II 2, to develop a mean-field theory of strain-free random\ntilings. We first propose a close upper-bound of log 2 for the entropy per tile, which can be seen as the order 0 of\nthe mean-field theory developed below. We then refine the estimate by calculating, within mean-field theory, the\ndistribution of tile vertex types. Finally we explore spatial correlations and related issues.\n1.\n\nFirst entropy estimate\n\nHere we set the upper-bound of log 2 for the entropy. To begin with, we mention that rigorous bounds of the large\nD entropy are known in the case of fixed-boundary tilings of unitary side length (see paper II36 , section II):\n1\nf ixed\nlog 2 \u2264 \u03c3\u221e\n\u2264 1.44 log 2.\n3\n\n(III.1)\n\nSince it is demonstrated in the same reference that this entropy per tile is equal to the free-boundary large D entropy\n\u03c3\u221e , the same bounds should hold for \u03c3\u221e . Our first mean-field estimate log 2 belongs to this interval, as well as the\nrefined mean-field estimate of the next section.\nLet PD (ND ) denote the number of ways to follow a directed walk of family D on a D \u2192 2 tiling. ND is the total\nlength of a single walk, or the cumulative length of a few walks. We will neglect contacts among walks of family\nD, which is justified since li \u223c D. To calculate a typical value of PD (ND ), consider the problem of constructing\nbottom-to-top paths on a typical tiling. At each step, the path may follow one or more routes (Fig. 7). The only\nrequirement is that the path segment leading out of a vertex must contain an upwards component. We estimate the\nnumber of paths as the product over vertices v of the number of choices Nc (v) to be made at each step\nPD (ND ) \u2248\n\nND\nY\n\nv=1\n\nNc (v).\n\n(III.2)\n\n\f10\n\nC\nB\n\nA\n\nFIG. 7: A random path (thick line) on a tiling as a succession of vertices with choices (dashed edge = choice not taken). There\nare 5 choices at vertex A (i.e. Nc (A) = 5), 2 choices at vertex B and only 1 choice at vertex C.\n\nEvaluation of equation (III.2) requires the distribution of values Nc (v) along paths. Because we do not know this\ndistribution (yet), we settle for an estimate that yields an upper bound on PD (ND ), and eventually on the entropy per\ntile SD . Note that the product in equation (III.2) is the ND -th power of the geometric mean of Nc (v). The geometric\nmean of any set of positive numbers is bounded above by the arithmetic mean, reaching this bound only when all\nvalues are equal. The arithmetic mean N\u0304c = Z\u0304/2, with Z\u0304 the mean coordination number (or degree), because on\naverage half the tile edges at each vertex have a vertical component in the northerly direction. From Euler's theorem\napplied to infinite rhombus tilings, we know Z\u0304 = 4, so that N\u0304c = 2. We deduce the D-independent upper bound\nPD (ND ) \u2264 2ND .\n\n(III.3)\n\nLet BD be the number of D \u2192 2 tilings (free boundary tilings of some size R).

First, to properly compute the geometric mean\nof Nc we need the full vertex path choice probability distribution \u03c0(Nc ). Second, our estimate eq. (III.2) neglected\ncorrelations among the numbers of choices at different steps along the path. In this subsection we address the first\npoint. In the next one we shall address briefly the second point.\nFollowing the logic in section III 1, the limiting entropy is\nlog PD (k)\n,\nD\u2192\u221e k\u2192\u221e\nk\n\n\u03c3\u221e = lim lim\n\n(III.8)\n\n\f11\nwhere PD (k) is the number of k-step paths on a D \u2192 2 tiling. The mean-field approximation assumes that the steps\nof such paths are uncorrelated so that the number of paths is given by eq. (III.2). The vertices v belong to a random\nD \u2192 2 tiling. Therefore the numbers of choices Nc (v) are distributed according to a probability distribution \u03c0D (Nc ).\nWhen D tends to infinity, this distribution tends toward a limiting distribution, denoted by \u03c0(Nc ). Thus, after a\nshort calculation, equations (III.8) and (III.2) become:\nMF\n\u03c3\u221e\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c0(Nc ) log Nc .\n\n(III.9)\n\nNc =1\n\np\nv1\n\nv\n\nv2\n\nq\n\nFIG. 8: A path going through a vertex v of a D \u2192 2 tiling gives birth to two vertices v1 and v2 of a D + 1 \u2192 2 tiling. The\npath follows any leg of v with probability 1/q and any arm with probability 1/p.\n\nTo get the mean-field distribution \u03c0(Nc ), let us first denote by \u03c0D (q, p) the fraction of vertices on a D \u2192 2 random\ntiling with q in-coming edges (\"legs\") and p out-going ones (\"arms\") (see figure 8). Neglecting correlations, a (q, p)vertex v of a D \u2192 2 tiling will be visited by paths with probability \u03c0D (q, p) and will then give birth to two vertices\nv1 and v2 , as illustrated in figure 8. These latter vertices belong to a D + 1 \u2192 2 tiling. Each leg and each arm of v\nwill be chosen with probabilities 1/q and 1/p, respectively. The new edge from v1 to v2 is arbitrarily chosen to be\noriented upward in the D + 1 \u2192 2 tiling and is therefore an arm for v1 and a leg for v2 .\nIndeed, a vertex with p\u2032 arms and q \u2032 legs can be either the \"left-son\" v1 or the \"right-son\" v2 of a \"father-vertex\"\nv in a D \u2192 2 tiling (figure 8). The two son vertices together inherit all their father's arms and legs, plus an extra\narm and leg (for the path along which the vertex is split). Finally, in addition, the left son gets an extra arm and the\nright son an extra leg from the new bond that joins them. Consequently the left-son has more than one arm and the\nright-son has more than one leg.\nAs a consequence, in this mean-field approximation, the probabilities \u03c0D+1 (q, p) can be written as linear combinations of the probabilities \u03c0D (q, p). The corresponding linear operator will be denoted by A : \u03c0D 7\u2192 \u03c0D+1 . It is\ninfinite-dimensional since q and p can be arbitrarily large when D goes to infinity. The operator A is defined by:\n\u03c0D+1 (q \u2032 , p\u2032 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b4q\u2032 ,1 )\n\nX \u03c0D (q, p)\nX \u03c0D (q, p)\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b4p\u2032 ,1 )\n.\n2qp\n2qp\nq\u2265q\u2032 \u22121\np\u2265p\u2032 \u22121\np\u2265p\u2032\n\n(III.10)\n\nq\u2265q\u2032\n\nThe first and second term refer, respectively, to left- and right-sons (v1 and v2 ). The factors of 1/2 expresses that a\nvertex is either a left-son or a right-son with probability 1/2. Moreover, each arm-leg pair is chosen with probability\n1/pq among all possibilities (see figure 8). The limiting distribution \u03c0(q, p) is the fixed point of A, the eigenvector\nwith eigenvalue 1.\nThe diagonalization of A being rather complex, we focus on a summation of the previous relation on legs q.

In particular, they condition the diffusive behavior of de Bruijn lines, they constrain\nthe successive steps in the iterative construction process, and they reduce the entropy slightly below the mean-field\nvalue. We can calculate both short- and long-range correlations among p and q within our mean-field theory. We also\nnote some expected properties of perpendicular space height correlations.\n1.\n\nShort-ranged correlations\n\nConsider the short-ranged correlation P\nbetween the numbers of arms and legs p and q on individual vertices. Within\nthe mean-field approximation, hpqiD = p,q \u03c0D (q, p)pq. If, at step D, a vertex v has p arms and q legs (see Fig. 8),\nthen its first son v1 has on average (2 + 3 + . . . (p + 1))/p = (p + 3)/2 arms independently of its number of legs, and\n(1 + . . . + q)/q = (q + 1)/2 legs independently of its number of arms. Similarly, its second son v2 has on average\n(p + 1)/2 arms and (q + 3)/2 legs. Therefore\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n1 p+1 q+3 1 p+3 q+1\nhpqiD+1 =\n\u03c0D (q, p)\n(III.15)\n+\n2 2\n2\n2 2\n2\np,q\n=\n\n1\n(hpqiD + 11),\n4\n\n\f13\nsince hpiD = hqiD = hNc i\u221a\nD = 2. The limiting value is hpqi\u221e = 11/3. Moreover, distribution (III.13) leads to\n\u2206p = (hp2 i\u221e \u2212 hpi2\u221e )1/2 = 3/2 and \u2206p = \u2206q. Therefore the mean-field covariance of p's and q's is\nhpqi\u221e \u2212 hpi\u221e hqi\u221e\n= \u22124/9 \u2243 \u22120.44,\n\u2206p \u2206q\n\ncov(p, q) =\n\n(III.16)\n\nalso in good agreement with the numerical value cov(p, q) \u2243 \u22120.36 (see paper II36 ). The main contribution to those\ncorrelations comes from the asymmetry caused by the edge between v1 and v2 .\nWe can use the covariance to improve on our original \"upper bound\" entropy estimate eq. (III.7) of log 2 = 0.693.\nWhereas the original estimate arose from the mean number of choices in single steps, we can instead consider the\ngeometric mean number of ways to make two steps. The product pqpcounts the number of two-step paths passing\nthrough a given vertex. Hence an improved entropy estimate is log 11/3 = 0.649, which is indeed closer to the\nnumerical value of 0.568, though nowhere near as close as our full mean-field value in eq. (III.14). Ideally, we would\ndetermine the full distribution of choices (i.e. number of arms) in two-step paths, \u03c02 (Nc1 , Nc2 ) then we could replace\nour MFT estimate eq.

(III.14) just as log\nconsiderably more difficult to obtain \u03c02 (Nc1 , Nc2 ) than \u03c0(Nc ).\n2.\n\np\nNc1 Nc2 ,\n\n(III.17)\n\np\n11/3 improved upon log 2. Unfortunately, it is\n\nLong-ranged correlations\n\nTo calculate long-range correlations using our iterative construction method, two phenomena compete: de Bruijn\nlines running through a tiling destroy vertex-to-vertex correlations, while they increase distances between vertices.\nConsider two vertices separated by a distance un on an n \u2192 2 tiling. The addition of successive families of lines to\nget higher codimension tilings (D \u2192 2 with D > n) make the tiling \"swell\" homogeneously, and the distances grow\nlike D. When D increases, the distance between the two vertices increases so that\nuD /D \u2243 un /n.\n\n(III.18)\n\nThe idea is now to track such pairs of vertices, and to estimate how their correlation functions evolve at the same\ntime they are moving apart.\nTo track these correlation functions as D increases, we estimate correlations between the number of choices at\nvertices, Nc (v). Define the correlation function between vertices va and vb , widely separated in space,\n!2\nX\n1 X\n1\nNc (va )Nc (vb ) \u2212\nCn (r) =\nNc (v)\n= hNc (va )Nc (vb )ir \u2212 hNc i2 .\n(III.19)\nNP\nNv v\nd(va ,vb )=r\n\nThe first average runs over the NP pairs of vertices of n \u2192 2 tilings separated by a distance r. The second average\nruns over all Nv vertices in the tiling. In the following, we denote hNc (va )Nc (vb )ir = \u03b3n . Moreover the mean number\nof choices hNc i = 2, so that\nCn (r) = \u03b3n \u2212 4.\n\n(III.20)\n\nWhen a new line passes through either va or vb , their correlation diminishes. Each vertex has a probability 2/n\nthat a new line goes through it (see eq. (II.14)). Therefore the probability that either one of the pair (va , vb ) will be\naffected by a new line is 4/n. A fraction 1 \u2212 4/n of pairs separated by r are unaffected, so their correlation remains\nequal to \u03b3n . The remaining pairs are affected, and we denote their new correlation by \u03b3n\u2032 which we now calculate.\nEach pair (va , vb ) that is affected gives birth to two pairs. One of its vertices, say vb , remains unchanged while the\nother one, va , gives birth to two vertices, a \"left-son\" va1 and a \"right-son\" va2 (see Fig. 8). On average,\nNc (va1 ) =\n\n1 + 2 + . . . + Nc (va )\n= Nc (va )/2 + 1/2,\nNc (va )\n\n(III.21)\n\nand Nc (va2 ) = Nc (va )/2 + 3/2, since a right-son has one more arm than a left-son. Therefore, averaging on the whole\ntiling, we find\n\u03b3n\u2032 = 1/2(hNc (va1 )Nc (vb )i + hNc (va2 )Nc (vb )i) = \u03b3n /2 + 2.\n\n(III.22)\n\n\f14\nNow we estimate \u03b3n+1 , the correlation averaged over all tiling vertices after the introduction of the lines of family\nn + 1. For original vertices not touched by the new lines, the correlation remains \u03b3n . For original vertices that are\ntouched by the new lines, the correlation becomes \u03b3n\u2032 . Therefore,\n\u03b3n+1 =\n\n(1 \u2212 4/n)\u03b3n + 8/n \u03b3n\u2032\n\u2248 (1 \u2212 8/n)\u03b3n + 8/n \u03b3n\u2032 + O(1/n).\n(1 \u2212 4/n) + 8/n\n\n(III.23)\n\nHence\nCn+1 (un+1 ) = (1 \u2212 4/n)Cn (un ).\n\n(III.24)\n\nNow iterating from n \u2192 D we write\nCD (uD ) = Cn (un )\n\nD\nY\n\nk=n+1\n\n(1 \u2212 4/k).\n\n(III.25)\n\nFor large n and D,\nlog CD = log Cn +\n\nD\u22121\nX\nk=n\n\nlog(1 \u2212 4/k) \u2243 log Cn \u2212 4\n\nD\u22121\nX\nk=n\n\n1/k \u2243 log Cn \u2212 4 log(D/n)\n\n(III.26)\n\nfrom which it follows that\nD4 CD (uD ) \u2243 n4 Cn (un ).\n\n(III.27)\n\n(uD )4 CD (uD ) \u2243 (un )4 Cn (un ).\n\n(III.28)\n\nUsing eq. (III.18) we have\n\nand finally\nC\u221e (r) \u2243 const.\n\n1\n.\nr4\n\n(III.29)\n\nThis expression holds only for large values of r, since we do not take into account the discreteness of tilings at very\nshort range. Correlations fall off rapidly at large distance.\n3.\n\nHeight-height correlations\n\nIn two dimensions, the random tiling hypothesis eq. (II.1) imples logarithmic behavior of the two-point height-height\ncorrelation function5\nG(r) \u2261 h(h(r) \u2212 h(0)2 i =\n\n1\nlog r\n\u03c0K\n\n(III.30)\n\nin the large r limit. We give here the generic form, without regard to the specific components of our D \u2212 2 dimensional\nheight function or the particular irreducible components of the phason strain tensor K. The only requirement is that\nthe elasticity tensor be positive definite, i.e. K > 0. Presumably eq. (III.30) will hold for any finite D.\nWe can easily derive an alternative formula for G(r) in the limit r \u226a D. Consider the shortest path joing two\ntiling vertices, and let s be the number of tile edges on this path. Provided s \u226a D, a typical path contains s distinct\nk\nedge orientations \u00b1\u00eai and its length r is proportional to s. In the perpendicular space, h(s) \u2212 h(0) contains s distinct\nterms equaling \u00b1\u00ea\u22a5\ni , the remaining D \u2212 2 \u2212 s components equaling 0. Since the products (A.6) are of order at most\n2\n2\n1/D whereas (\u00ea\u22a5\ni ) = 1, (h(s) \u2212 h(0)) \u2243 s when s \u226a D. Consequently\nG(r) \u221d r\n\n(III.31)\n\nfor r \u226a D. Now taking the D \u2192 \u221e limit, and comparing eq. (III.31) with the large r limit (III.30), we see that K\nmust vanish in the limit of large D or else G(r) will lack monotonicity. Section IV 2 provides further evidence for the\nvanishing of K.\n\n\f15\n4.\n\nFinite D corrections\n\nThe mean-field calculations of section III 2 neglect the fact that at the step D of the iterative process, only a\ndiminishing fraction of of the vertices are visited by paths. Correcting this oversight does not alter the fixed point of\nthe process, but predicts finite D corrections to it. Indeed, at step D, a fraction 2/D of the vertices are visited. Each\nof them has 2 sons and equation (III.10) applies only to a fraction of new vertices of order 4/D when one iterates at\nstep D. The remaining vertices are unaffected. Hence the correct evolution operator is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n4\n\u00c2D = \u00c2 + 1 \u2212\nId.\n(III.32)\nD\nD\nwhere \u00c2 is the operator introduced in eq. (III.12). For any finite D, the fixed point of \u00c2 remains the fixed point of\n\u00c2D . Any eigenvector e of \u00c2 associated with the eigenvalue \u03bc evolves as follows:\n\u00c2D \u00c2D\u22121 . . . \u00c22 * e =\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\nD \u0012\nY\nC\n4\n4(\u03bc \u2212 1)\ne \u2243 4(1\u2212\u03bc) e,\n\u03bc + (1 \u2212 ) e =\n1+\nk\nk\nk\nD\n\nD \u0012\nY\n4\n\nk=2\n\n(III.33)\n\nk=2\n\nwhere C is some constant of order 1, using the same calculation scheme as in equations (III.26) and (III.27).\nHence we get power-law convergence towards the fixed point instead of exponential convergence. The spectrum of\n\u00c2 can be calculated numerically, by taking finite but larger and larger approximations of A. The spectrum converges\nrapidly towards {1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . , 1/p, . . .}. Eigenvalue \u03bc = 1 is the desired fixed point. The slowest mode corresponds\nto \u03bc = 1/2 and to a 1/D2 behavior of the finite D corrections to \u03c0(Nc ), and therefore to the entropy (III.9). Thus\nfinite D corrections to the entropy associated with path-counting are expected to behave like 1/D2 in the mean-field\napproximation.\nIV.\n\nDE BRUIJN LINE INTERACTIONS\n\nThe mean-field theory addresses the statistics of isolated de Bruijn lines influenced by the statistics of the D \u22121 \u2192 2\ntiling they meander on, but with no other interactions. A crucial fact about the de Bruijn line construction of tilings\nis that lines within the same family may never cross, resulting in an effective repulsive interaction at contact47 . We\nnow analyze the effect of interactions on finite size corrections and on phason elasticity.\n1.\n\nEntropy loss due to contacts in strain-free tilings\n\nWe call \"contact\" between two neighbor lines of a same family a configuration where these lines are adjacent. Such\na situation is represented in figure 4, where we have circled one contact between neighboring paths (or de Bruijn\nlines). If we follow the lines in the direction t, the local initial angles \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032 they make with their global direction\n\u03b4 after the contact are constrained by the noncrossing relation \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8\u2032 . This constraint divides the number of allowed\nconfigurations by a factor of order 2 as compared to the free path case, and reduces the total entropy by about log 2.\nTo estimate the global entropy loss due to contacts in an infinite tiling, we must calculate the density of contacts. A\ncrucial quantity is the distance Li between consecutive contacts with neighboring lines of family i. Inspecting Fig. 4\nk\nwe see that contacts between lines of family i = D result from diffusion of the lines in the direction \u00eaD . Note that Li\ndepends on both li (because wider separation reduces the frequency of contacts of diffusing lines) and \u03c6i (because the\ndiffusion constant has corrections in the \u03c6i ; these corrections are quadratic because of the symmetry of the problem\nthrough any line). In strain-free tilings, which have maximal rotational symmetry, li = li\u2217 = D/2 and \u03c6i = 0 and\nLi = L is independent of i.\nDefine the diffusion constant D so that the lateral displacement u after traveling a distance L in the direction \u03b4i\nis u2 \u223c DL. We presume that D takes a finite limiting value in the large D limit. Thus DL \u223c (li\u2217 )2 , and there is\napproximately one contact among lines of family i in every region of area A = li\u2217 L = (li\u2217 )3 /D. Adding up the total\nnumber of contacts expected among lines of all orientations, we estimate the loss of entropy per unit area as\n\u2206\u03c3 \u2248 \u2212\n\nDD\n1\nlog 2 = \u22128D log 2 2 .\n(li\u2217 )3\nD\n\n(IV.1)\n\nThis quantity should be suitably rescaled if one is interested in the entropy per tile. The strain-free loss of entropy\nfalls off like 1/D2 because as D grows large, lines of like orientation rarely contact each other.\n\n\f16\n2.\n\nPhason elastic constant tensor\n\nWe now investigate the phason strain dependence of the entropy and test the generic form assumed in eq. (II.1). A\nthorough discussion of phason elasticity requires a group-theoretical analysis of rotational invariants44 , each leading\nto an independent phason elastic constant, which lies beyond the scope of this paper. Rather, we will assume a generic\nform of strain and estimate its impact on the entropy. In particular, we shall see that K decays like 1/D when D\nbecomes large.\nTo start, consider expanding \u03c3D (E) to second order in \u03c6i and \u03b4li = li \u2212 li\u2217 . Note that this expansion does not\ncouple explicitly angles \u03c6i and line spacings \u03b4li because a symmetry through any line changes \u03c6i into \u2212\u03c6i whereas\nit does not affect \u03b4li . Therefore this expansion is the sum of a quadratic form in the \u03c6i 's and of a quadratic form\nin the \u03b4li 's. Some phason elastic constants are related to the angles \u03c6i only. The remaining ones are related to the\nvariations of the line spacings li only.\nAt present we consider only the li strain. To estimate the strain-dependence of the loss of entropy by contact we\nmust calculate the density of contacts as a function of strain. We impose a global phason strain by varying only the\nmean distance li between de Bruijn lines of family i. Let\nli = li\u2217 (1 + \u03bb\u03b4i )\n\n(IV.2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a small parameter that controls the strength of the phason strain. Here \u03b4i is an arbitrary but bounded\nfunction of i whose mean and standard deviation obey h\u03b4i = 0 and h\u03b4 2 i = 1, where the averages are taken over families\ni. Owing to the bounded tile fraction constraint eq. (II.21), whatever the strength of the phason strain, li is of order\nD and \u03bb is of order at most 1. The requirement of vanishing mean is imposed by the normalization condition (II.18).\nConsider a pair of adjacent lines of family i, and evaluate Li , the mean distance between contacts of these lines. Thus\nDLi \u223c li2 , and there is approximately one contact among lines of family i in every region of area Ai = li Li = li3 /D.\nThe entropy loss (IV.1) becomes\n\u2206\u03c3 \u2248 \u2212DDhl\u22123 i log 2.\n\n(IV.3)\n\nNow consider the average hl\u22123 i. For vanishing phason strain (\u03bb \u2192 0), eq. (II.15) reveals that li = li\u2217 = D/2.\nExpanding li\u22123 in eq. (IV.2) for small \u03bb, using the known mean and standard deviation of \u03b4i , we obtain\nhl\n\n\u22123\n\ni\u2248\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nD\n\n\u00133\n\n(1 + 6\u03bb2 ).\n\n(IV.4)\n\nSubstituting this expression into eq. (IV.3) yields\n\u2206\u03c3 \u2248 \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n6\u03bb2\n1\n+\nD2\nD2\n\n\u0013\n\n8D log 2.\n\n(IV.5)\n\nWe find two terms, each falling off as 1/D2 . The first term, which arises in the absence of strain, reproduces eq. (IV.1).\nIn a strained tiling with \u03bb 6= 0, owing to eq. (II.21), li remains of order D, and the loss of entropy is also of order\n1/D2 . Although the frequency of contacts increases due to the strain, it still falls off for large D.\nBecause the entropy is independent of the phason strain at the large D limit, we again conclude that the phason\nelastic constant vanishes. We have seen (eq. (II.23)) that for bounded tile fractions the phason strain E 2 decreases\nlike 1/D as D increases. Comparing eq. (II.1) with the strain-corrections of order 1/D2 that we can calculate, we\nconclude that the phason elastic tensor K falls off as 1/D.\nWe can understand the vanishing phason strain correction by the following qualitative argument. Consider a domain\nof the tiling of diameter \u2206, large as compared to the tile size 1 but small as compared\nto the mean distance between\n\u221a\ntwo lines of a same family, 1 \u226a \u2206 \u226a D. For example, one can choose \u2206 = D. In such a domain there is at most\none de Bruijn line per family, and no lines at all of most families. Since \u2206 tends to infinity with D, the area of the\ndomain tends to infinity and the number of lines and tiles in the domain also tend to infinity.\nLocally, as D and \u2206 go to infinity, the tiling looks like a large codimension D\u2032 \u2192 2 tiling (where D\u2032 \u223c \u2206), with\nonly one line per family (see Fig. 9). The entropy per tile in this domain tends towards a quantity \u03c3loc which depends\nneither on the strain nor on the domain under consideration and is directly related to a simplified problem with one\nline in each family. The global entropy per tile \u03c3\u221e is the average over the whole tiling11 of the local entropy density\n\u03c3loc . Therefore \u03c3\u221e = \u03c3loc is independent of the de Bruijn line separations li , of the angles \u03c6i and of the global phason\nstrain.\n\n\f17\n\n\u2206\n\nFIG. 9: A domain of diameter \u2206 which contains at most one de Bruijn line per family.\nV.\n\nTILINGS OF DIMENSION OTHER THAN 2\n\nThis section discusses briefly cases of dimension other than d = 2. The high codimension d = 1 case is especially\ninteresting because it is exactly solvable. It serves as an excellent illustration of several of the concepts in the paper\nand contrasts interestingly with the high codimension d = 2 case. We then present results and conjectures for the\nhigh codimension d = 3 case and the codimension 1 case with d = D \u2212 1 for arbitrary d.\n1.\n\nD \u2192 1 tilings\n\nOne-dimensional high codimension D \u2192 1 tilings are exactly solvable, as we show it in this subsection. The special\ncase D = 2 was previously discussed, for example in5 . These tilings comprise D different species of tiles randomly\narranged on a line. This case is unusual since the entropy per tile tends to infinity with D. Still, this example is quite\ninstructive since it already contains a characteristic feature of large codimension tilings: when D goes to infinity, we\nprove that the entropy no longer depends on the relative tile fractions provided these quantities remain bounded.\nThe number of tilings is given by the multinomial coefficient:\nW D\u21921 (k1 , . . . , kD ) =\n\n(k1 + k2 + . . . + kD )!\n.\nk1 ! k2 ! . . . kD !\n\n(V.1)\n\nIntroducing tile fractions xi = ki /(k1 + . . . + kD ), we get the entropy per tile at large D\n\u03c3 D\u21921 = \u2212\n\nD\nX\n\nxi log xi .\n\n(V.2)\n\ni=1\n\nThis entropy is maximal at xi = 1/D where it equals log D. In one dimension, for the sake of convenience in the\ncalculation, we set the upper bound xi \u2264 a/D where a > 0 to prevent some tile species from being dominant. Then\nP\nPD\n\u2212 log xi \u2265 log D \u2212 log a, and hence \u2212 D\ni=1 xi log xi \u2265 log D \u2212 log a because\ni=1 xi = 1. Therefore\nlog D \u2212 log a \u2264 \u03c3 D\u21921 \u2264 log D.\n\n(V.3)\n\nThe entropy grows asymptotically like log D + O(1), independently of the exact tile fractions provided they remain\nbounded.\nLarge D phason elastic constants can also be calculated. Near the entropy maximum at xi = 1/D,\nKi =\n\n\u22022\u03c3\n= \u2212D.\n\u2202x2i\n\n(V.4)\n\nP 2\n1\n+ \u03b4xi , so that \u03c3 = \u03c3max \u2212 D\n\u03b4xi . The average gradient of the function h (representing the oneLet xi = D\n2\ndimensional membrane in the D-dimensional space) is characterized by the average angle \u03c8 this membrane makes\nwith the reference direction (1, 1, . . . , 1). Specifically, (\u2207h)2 = tan2 \u03c8 \u2243 \u03c8 2 . Now,\n!\u22121/2\nD\nD\nX\nDX 2\n\u03c82\n\u22431\u2212\nx2i\n\u03b4x .\n(V.5)\n\u2243 cos \u03c8 = D\n1\u2212\n2\n2 i=1 i\ni=1\n\n\f18\nFinally, (\u2207h)2 = D\n\nP\n\n\u03b4x2i and\n\u03c3 D\u21921 \u2243 \u03c3max \u2212\n\nK\n(\u2207h)2 ,\n2\n\n(V.6)\n\nwhere the phason elastic constant K = 1 is vanishingly small as compared to the entropy \u03c3max . Note the value of K\nis independent of D, and of course it agrees with the previous value5 derived for D = 2.\n2.\n\nD \u2192 3 tilings\n\nUnlike the cases of d = 1 and d = 2, we have neither exact, nor extensive numerical information available for high\ncodimension d = 3 tilings. Table II collects available data on d = 3 strain-free boundary tilings. For D \u2264 3 the\nentropy vanishes. No data is available for D = 5. For D = 4 and 6, data is available from computer simulations48,49 .\nThe 6 \u2192 3 case49 deals with rhombohedron tilings with icosahedral symmetry.\nTo estimate the large D limit, we insert oriented membranes into d = 3 tilings, as previously we inserted lines into\nd = 2 tilings. Membranes of like orientation are forbidden to cross. In the large D limit, we can neglect contact\nof like-oriented membranes and consider the statistics of a single membrane in generic high symmetry tilings. Let\nMD (\u03c4 ) denote the number of such membranes that can be inserted into tiling \u03c4 and M\u0304D be the arithmetic mean of\nthis number. We find that the number of D \u2192 3 tilings is\nBD =\n\nD\u22121\nY\n\nM\u0304D\u2032 .\n\n(V.7)\n\nD\u2032 =3\n\nanalogously to eq. (III.5). The entropy per tile is the logarithm of this number divided by the number of tiles.\nWe obtain an upper bound on the large D entropy of d = 3 tilings in a manner similar to our upper bound of\nlog 2 for for d = 2. Recall 2D is an upper bound on the number of directed paths in d = 2 tilings, and is actually\nrealized only on special tilings in which the degree Z = 4 at all sites, with two incoming and two outgoing vertices.\nSimilarly, the number of directed membranes may be maximal on a special tiling in which the coordination number and\nchoice numbers are most homogeneous. This is the simple cubic tiling in which each vertex is six-fold coordinated.\nThe membrane orientation should be in the plane perpendicular to the (111) axis. At each vertex there are 18\npossible directed membrane configurations. This leads to M\u0304D \u2264 18N membranes containing N rhombi, a substantial\noverestimate because many of these configurations force unique membrane structures nearby.\nA true upper bound is\nM\u0304D \u2264 e\u03c33\u21922 N ,\n\n\u03c3 D\u21923 \u2264 \u03c3 3\u21922\n\n(V.8)\n\nbecause the problem of the directed membrane on the simple cubic lattice is just the 3 \u2192 2 tiling problem. This value\nis an upper bound because it neglects contacts, and because generic D \u2192 3 tilings will be less homogeneous than the\nsimple cubic lattice and therefore the entropy lower.\n3.\n\nD \u2192 D \u2212 1 tilings\n\nIn this section, we study the entropy of strain-free D \u2192 D \u2212 1 tilings where the D different tiles appear with the\nsame fraction 1/D and we derive rigorous lower and upper bounds:\nlog 2\n3\u03c3 3\u21922\n\u2264 \u03c3 D\u2192D\u22121 <\nD\nD\n\n(V.9)\n\nNote that the two prefactors log 2 \u2243 0.693 and 3\u03c3 3\u21922 \u2243 0.969 are satisfactorily close and mutually consistent.\nTo derive the lower bound, we first notice that the elementary tiles of figure 3, namely hexagons and rhombic\ndodecahedrons, perfectly tile the entire two- and three-dimensional space, respectively. In fact, it is possible to tile\nany d-dimensional Euclidean space with the shadow P of a unit cube of dimension D = d + 1 projected along the\n(1, 1, . . . , 1) direction. To understand this, consider all the\nPunit cubes of a D-dimensional hypercubic lattice the centers\nof which belong to the diagonal hyperplane of equation\nxi = 0. Their projection along the (1, 1, . . . , 1) direction is\nthe desired tiling with the tile P . Now, such a polytope P can be tiled in two different ways with the D tiles of the\nD \u2192 D \u2212 1 tilings under consideration, as shown in figure 3, and independently of its neighbors. If we have a total\nof N tiles, we have N/D such polytopes, which provides 2N/D different tilings. Thus the total number of tilings is\nbounded below by 2N/D , which leads to the lower bound (V.9) on \u03c3 D\u2192D\u22121 .\n\n\f19\nTo understand the upper bound, we begin with the 4 \u2192 3 case. In 3-dimensional tilings, we extend the notion of de\nBruijn lines and define de Bruijn surfaces. The latter are connected sets of rhombohedral tiles which share a common\nface orientation. In 4 \u2192 3 tilings, there are 4 families Fi of such surfaces, since there are 4 possible edge orientations\nk\n\u00eai . In d-dimensional tilings, there are (d \u2212 1)-dimensional surfaces defined similarly. Like in the two-dimensional case,\ntwo adjacent surfaces of a same family cannot cross but can have contacts.\nLike in the previous subsection, such a surface in a 4 \u2192 3 tiling can be put in one-to-one correspondence with a\n3 \u2192 2 tiling, just as in a 3 \u2192 2 tiling, a de Bruijn line can be seen as a directed random walk on a square grid like\na 2 \u2192 1 tiling. Therefore if we do not take contacts between surfaces into account, a 4 \u2192 3 tiling is a collection of\nindependent 3 \u2192 2 tilings, corresponding to all the de Bruijn surfaces of a given family. Of course, this approach\nwill only provide an upper bound since contacts constraint the surfaces and reduce the entropy. Now the entropy of\n3 \u2192 2 tilings is known, and a fraction 3/4 of the tiles of the original 4 \u2192 3 tilings belong to the de Bruijn surfaces of\nthe family under consideration. Therefore\n\u03c3 4\u21923 <\n\n3 3\u21922\n\u03c3\n= 0.242.\n4\n\n(V.10)\n\nNow, we can iterate the same argument in any dimension, thus getting that\n\u03c3 D\u2192D\u22121 <\n\nD \u2212 1 D\u22121\u2192D\u22122\nD \u2212 2 D\u22122\u2192D\u22123\n3\n\u03c3\n<\n\u03c3\n< . . . < \u03c3 3\u21922 ,\nD\nD\nD\n\n(V.11)\n\nwhich leads to the upper bound eq. (V.9). The actual 4 \u2192 3 entropy is strictly smaller than our bound (V.10),\nand its knowledge provides better upper bounds for larger D tilings. The best numerical estimate of this entropy is\n\u03c3 4\u21923 = 0.214 \u00b1 0.002 [48 ], which leads to \u03c3 D\u2192D\u22121 < 4\u03c3 4\u21923 /D = (0.856 \u00b1 0.008)/D for D \u2265 4, a noticeably better\nupper bound than (V.9). Similarly, the exact knowledge of any D \u2192 D \u2212 1 entropy would provide a better upper\nbound for the entropy of tilings of dimension larger than D.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis paper studied random tiling models in the limit of high rotational symmetry. We developed a mean-field\ntheory for tilings based on the iterative construction of rhombus tilings introduced by de Bruijn43 . Our main goal is\nto improve on the knowledge of the tiling entropy. Table III summarizes the progress to-date. Evidently the mean-field\ntheory is a considerable improvement upon earlier bounds.\nThe relevant quantity in our mean-field theory is the number of choices at each vertex, which is related to its\ncoordination number (degree). In contrast to prior work that focused on the mean number of choices, the current\nstudy yields the distribution of the number of choices. Table IV demonstrates excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulation.\nWe argue that high symmetry tilings become insensitive to phason strain, unlike finite symmetry tilings. In other\nwords, phason elasticity vanishes at large codimension. In addition to the entropy and the phason elasticity, we\nconsidered finite size corrections and correlation functions.\nOur mean-field theory does not take into account spatial correlations which should modify slightly the entropy. For\nexample, if a vertex has a low degree, it has less chance to be visited in the iterative process, which modifies the fixed\npoint (III.13) and the entropy. Large degree vertices are more likely to be visited and to be split into two vertices\nof lower degree. We expect them to be less numerous than in our calculation (see table IV), which accounts for the\nactual lower value of the entropy.\nOur mean-field theory could be enhanced by inclusion of correlations. Instead of single vertices (with their arms\nand legs), one might instead study the statistics of pairs of vertices or even larger tiling patches and determine how\nthese statistics evolve via the iterative process, when they are split into two pieces by a path going through them. It\nwould also be useful to predict how the spatial correlations calculated in the paper perturb the mean-field entropy.\nA second paper36 follows this one and presents the numerical Monte Carlo study of large codimension tilings. In\nparticular, it is demonstrated in this paper that in such tilings, the thermodynamic limit is restored: fixed boundaries\ndo not result in the lowering of the entropy like in finite codimension cases.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Chris Henley and Pavel Kalugin for useful discussions.

We embed these spaces in the D-dimensional hyperspace RD . Let the unit vectors\n{\u00eai } be an orthonormal basis for RD . Their normalized projections into E k and E \u22a5 will be denoted, respectively, by\nk\n\u00eai and \u00ea\u22a5\ni . Our first task is to represent these projections in the hyperspace basis.\nWe define the two-dimensional \"parallel\" space E k by its orthonormal basis\nk\n\nx\u0302 =\nk\n\n\u0177 =\n\nr\nr\n\nD\u22121\n\u03c0j\n2 X\n\u00eaj cos ( )\nD j=0\nD\n\n(A.1)\n\nD\u22121\n2 X\n\u03c0j\n\u00eaj sin ( ).\nD j=0\nD\n\nGiven the basis for E we define the projection operator Pk by Pk (u) \u2261 (x\u0302k * u)x\u0302k + (\u0177 k * u)\u0177 k and its complement\nk\nP\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 Pk . The parallel space vectors \u00eai are the projections of suitably scaled hyperspace basis vectors,\nk\n\n\u00eai \u2261 Pk (sk \u00eai ).\n\n(A.2)\n\nNote that they form a regular fan\nk\n\n\u00eai = x\u0302k cos (\n\n\u03c0i\n\u03c0i\n) + \u0177 k sin ( ).\nD\nD\n\n(A.3)\n\nBy a \"regular fan\" we mean a collection of equally spaced vectors arranged in the upper half plane.\nThe union of\np\nthese vectors and their negatives forms a 2D-fold symmetric star. We set the scale factor sk = D/2 to normalize\nk\n\u00eai in eq. (A.3).\nThe (D \u2212 2)-dimensional \"perpendicular\" space E \u22a5 is the complement in RD of E k . Consider the projection of the\nscaled hyperspace vector s\u22a5 \u00eai into E \u22a5 , which we can express as\n\u00ea\u22a5\ni \u2261 P\u22a5 (s\u22a5 \u00eai ) = s\u22a5 (\u00eai \u2212 Pk \u00eai ).\n\n(A.4)\n\nkP\u22a5 s\u22a5 \u00eai k2 = s2\u22a5 (1 + kPk \u00eai k2 \u2212 2\u00eai * Pk \u00eai ) \u2261 1.\n\n(A.5)\n\nIts magnitude can be found from\n\np\nk\nWe evaluate kPk \u00eai k2 = 1/s2k = 2/D from eq. (A.2), and we evaluate \u00eai * Pk \u00eai = 2/D\u00eai * \u00eai = 2/D from eq. (A.3)\np\ntogether with eq. (A.1). Then eq. (A.5) yields s\u22a5 = 1/ 1 \u2212 2/D. The following result will also be useful: if i 6= j\nthen\n\u22a5\n\u00ea\u22a5\ni * \u00eaj = \u2212\nk\n\n2\nk\nk\n\u00ea * \u00ea .\nD\u22122 i j\n\n(A.6)\n\nk\n\n\u22a5 2\nIndeed, \u00eai * \u00eaj = \u03b4ij = \u00eai * \u00eaj /s2k + \u00ea\u22a5\ni * \u00eaj /s\u22a5 .\nEvery vertex v in a rhombus tiling occupies a position of the form\n\nrk (v) =\n\nD\nX\ni=1\n\nk\n\nRi (v)\u00eai \u2208 E k\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhere the coefficients Ri are integers. To find the values of Ri for vertex v, choose any vertex as the origin for E k ,\nk\nthen follow a path of rhombus edges from the origin to v. Adding to (or subtracting from) Ri for each edge \u00eai along\nthe path yields the values of Ri (v). The perpendicular space position of that vertex is defined as\nh(rk ) = h(v) =\n\nD\nX\ni=1\n\n\u22a5\nRi (v)\u00ea\u22a5\ni \u2208 E .\n\n(A.8)\n\n\f21\nValues of h(r) for r in the interior of a tile can be defined using linear interpolation on the values just defined for tile\nvertices.\nThe equation of a flat (strain-free) tiling, or of a locally flat tiling after coarse-graining is defined by D vectors\nmi \u2208 E k such that\nRi (v) = mi * rk ,\n\n(A.9)\n\nthe above equality meaning that Ri (v) is the closest integer to the right-hand side quantity.
