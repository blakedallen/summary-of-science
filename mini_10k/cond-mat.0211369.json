Sato (e-mail: msato@b-lab.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp)\nKeywords:\n\npyrochlore molybdate, neutron scattering, magnetic structure,\nspin chirality, anomalous Hall resistivity\n\n\fIntroduction\nPyrochlore molybdate R2Mo2O7 (R=Y and various rare earth elements) belongs to the pyrochlore\nseries of compounds described by the general formula of A2B2O7. The compounds have the face-centered\ncubic structure with the space group Fd 3 m, in which A, B, O(1) and O(2) atoms fully occupy the sites\n16d(A), 16c(B), 48f(O(1)) and 8b(O(2)), and the former two individually form three dimensional networks\nof corner-sharing tetrahedra.1) The local principal axis of a corner site of a tetrahedron corresponds to\nthe line which connects the site with the center of gravity of the tetrahedron. Because the single ion\nanisotropy of magnetic moments determined by the symmetry of local arrangement of surrounding\natoms directs along the principal axis and because there are four different but crystallographically\nequivalent principal axes corresponding to the four corner sites, along [111] and other directions,\nnon-collinear or non-coplanar magnetic structure is often expected.\nIn R2Mo2O7, both the transport and the magnetic properties seem to exhibit systematic variation\nwith the ionic radius of R3+, that is, for the relatively larger elements R=Nd, Sm and Gd, the system\nexhibits the ferromagnetic transition, whereas for the smaller R=Tb-Lu and Y, it is insulating and\nexhibits the spin-glass-like behavior.2-4) The spin-glass behavior is considered to originate from the\ngeometrical frustration\nNd2Mo2O7 is metallic and exhibits a ferromagnetic transition at a Curie temperature Tc=93 K.\nNeutron diffraction studies on a single crystal of Nd2Mo2O7 were carried out and the magnetic structure\nin the temperature(T) region of 4 K \u2264 T \u2264 TC has been proposed by the authors' group in refs. 5 and 6.\nIn the T region between 30 K and TC, the ferromagnetic ordering at TC=93 K is primarily associated\nwith the Mo-moments, while the ordering of the Nd moments becomes significant below 30K. The net\nmagnetization of the Nd-moments is antiparallel to that of the Mo-moments. The low temperature\nmagnetic structure is non-collinear for both the Mo- and Nd-moments: The Mo-moments align along the\ndirection nearly parallel to the [001] or other equivalent axes, but slightly tilted towards the local\nprincipal axes, while the Nd moments are along the directions almost parallel to their principal axes\nwith their net magnetization being antiparallel to that of the Mo-moments. Because two of four Nd\nmoments at corner sites of a tetrahedron direct inwards and the other two direct outwards of the\ntetrahedron, the magnetic structure is called \"two-in and two-out\" configuration.\nUnusual behavior of the Hall resistivity (\u03c1H) on single crystals of Nd2Mo2O7 in the magnetic field (H)\nalong [111] or [001] direction has been reported by the authors' group.7,8) In the T region of 30 K<T<TC,\nwhere the net magnetization is primarily from the Mo-moments, H-dependence of the Hall resistivity\ncan be described by the well-known equation \u03c1 H=R0H+4\u03c0RsM as for ordinary ferromagnets, where R0\nand Rs are the ordinary and anomalous Hall coefficients, respectively, and M is the total magnetization.\nIn the temperature region of T<30 K, where the ordering of the Nd-moments is significant, the\nexpression no more works and instead, another phenomenological equation \u03c1H=R0H+4\u03c0RsMMo+4\u03c0Rs'MNd\nhas been found to describe the experimental results rather well, where MMo and MNd, and Rs and Rs' are\nthe net magnetizations and the anomalous Hall coefficient which correspond to the Mo- and Ndmoments, respectively. Rs \u00d7 Rs' is found to be negative.(We defined the sign of MNd to be negative if MNd is\nantiparallel to MMo.) It is interesting that Rs and Rs' do not exhibit significant decrease as T approaches\nzero, which is rather different from the behavior of the ordinary ferromagnets.9,10) Although many\n2\n\n\ftheoretical works have been reported on the anomalous Hall effect, old theories which are based on the\nband picture11) or on the mechanism of the conduction election scattering by localized moments12),\ncannot describe this behavior. Effects of the Ti-doping into the Mo sites on the Hall resistivity have also\nbeen studied on single crystals of the present system, where it is found that the sign change of Rs takes\nplace with the small amount of the Ti-doping with the sign of Rs' unchanged.13) This indicates that two\ncomponents are necessary to describe the behavior of \u03c1H of Nd2Mo2O7.\nA new proposal has been made that the ordering of the spin chirality(\u03c7 ) contributes to the Hall\nresistivity, where \u03c7 is locally defined as \u03c7 \u2261 S1\u2219S2 \u00d7 S3 for three spins S1, S2 and S3.14) In this theory, the\nanomalous Hall conductivity \u03c3H (=\u03c1H/ \u03c12) is proportional to the fictitious magnetic flux(\u03a6) induced by the\nspin chirality \u03c7, where \u03c1 is the electrical resistivity. Taguchi et al. proposed that the spin chirality or the\nfictitious magnetic flux of the Mo-moments is playing an important role in determining the unusual\nbehavior of the Hall resistivity.15) However, authors' group has reported that the idea does not seem to\nconsistently explain the observed behavior.5,6,13) It is important for clarifying the relationship between\nthe spin chiral order and the anomalous Hall resistivity, to study the detailed magnetic structure of\nNd2Mo2O7, particularly to study the magnetic structure in the applied magnetic field.\nIn the present work, neutron scattering studies have been carried out on a single crystal of\nNd2Mo2O7 in the applied magnetic field H(//[011]) up to 5.7 T. The H-dependence of the magnetic\nstructure is naturally understood by considering the Mo-Mo and Mo-Nd exchange fields and the single\nion anisotropies of the Mo- and Nd-moments. Then, the spin chirality and the fictitious magnetic flux\nhave been calculated as a function of H at T=1.6 K and as a function of T at H=0. Comparing the Hall\nresistivity \u03c1H deduced from the fictitious magnetic flux with the experimentally observed data, we have\nfound that the unusual behavior of the Hall resistivity of Nd2Mo2O7 cannot consistently be understood\nby the chiral order mechanism in the present system.\nExperiment\nExperiments\nments\nA single crystal of Nd2Mo2O7 with a volume of ~0.3 cm3 was grown by a floating zone (FZ) method in\nAr atmosphere. The magnetization and the Hall resistivity were measured by using edge parts of the\ncrystal. The crystal planes of the samples were determined by observing the X-ray or neutron diffraction\nlines. The magnetization M and the Hall resistivity \u03c1H were measured as a function of H by using a\nSQUID magnetometer, as described in refs.7 and 8.\nNeutron measurements were carried out by using the triple axis spectrometer HQR(T1-1) installed\nat the thermal guide of JRR-3M of JAERI in Tokai, where the double axis condition was adopted. The\ncrystal was oriented with the [0 1 1] direction vertical, where the [011] and [100] axes are in the\nscattering plane. The magnetic field was applied by using a superconducting magnet along the vertical\nor [011] direction. The 002 reflections of Pyrolytic graphite (PG) were used for both the monochromator\nand analyzer. Horizontal collimations were 12'(effective)-20'-60' and the neutron wavelength was\n$\n\n2.460 A . A PG filter was put in front of the sample to suppress the higher-order contamination.\n\nExperimental R\nResults\nesults and Discussion\n3\n\n\fIn the fields H=0 and 5 T, the neutron elastic scattering intensity has been measured on the single\ncrystal of Nd2Mo2O7 at various Q-points in the reciprocal space including those with half integer values\nof h and k(=l) at 113 K(>TC) and 1.6 K(<TC). No reflection has been detected at Q-points except the\nnuclear Bragg points. The scattering intensities at several nuclear Bragg points increases with\ndecreasing T through the Curie temperature. The intensities also depend on the values of the external\nmagnetic field H applied along //[011]. Examples of the observed profiles of several reflections are shown\nin Figs. 1(a)-1(d), where the data at 113 K(>TC) are the contribution from the nuclear reflection. In the\npresent experiment, we have not observed the 002 nuclear reflection and all the nuclear reflections can\nbe explained by the undistorted pyrochlore structure (space group Fd 3 m). The observation of the\nreflection in the previous measurements5,6) is considered to be due to the imperfect removal of the\nhigh-order contamination. (The same crystal was used in the present and previous studies.) The profile\nwidths of all reflections observed at 1.6 K under the magnetic field are equal to those of the instrumental\nresolution within the experimental error bars.\nThe magnetic scattering intensities Imag of Nd2Mo2O7 of the 111, 200, 022, 311 and 400 reflections\nare shown at 1.6K against the magnetic field H(H//[011]) in Figs. 2(a)-2(e), respectively, where the data\nare taken by scanning H stepwise up to 5.7 T after zero field cooling and then to zero. Hysteretic\nbehavior of the Imag \u2013H curves has been observed in the region of H \u22641.5 T. It is due to the hysteretic\ndomain motion. Imag was obtained by taking the differences between the integrated intensities below and\nabove TC, where the absorption- and Lorentz factor-corrections were considered. The extinction effect\nhas been estimated by plotting the observed values of the absolute structure factors |F(Q)|2 of the\nnuclear scattering determined at 113K against those estimated by adopting the positional parameter z\n=0.333 for 48f(O(1)) sites. Details of the extinction correction have already been reported in ref. 5. Effects\nof the error of the extinction correction do not bring about essential changes of the results of the present\nstudy, because only the data at the Bragg points where the extinction effect is not serious (or scattering\nintensity is relatively weak) are mainly considered in the magnetic structure analysis.\nThe system has the f.c.c. unit cell and the crystal structure consists of two networks individually\nformed by corner sharing tetrahedra of Mo4 or Nd4 as mentioned above. In this f.c.c. cell, each one of four\nprimitive cells has a structure unit consisting of a Mo4-tetrahedron and a Nd4-one. In the measurements\nat 1.6 K in the zero- and finite magnetic fields, the magnetic reflections have been observed only at\n\nQ-points with even h and k or odd h and k, where h and k are defined with respect to the f.c.c. unit cell.\nThis result indicates that the magnetic primitive cell of Nd2Mo2O7 has the same size as the chemical\nprimitive cell. Then, to determine the magnetic structure of the present system, we are just required to\nfind the moment arrangements within each one of Mo4- and Nd4-tetrahedra (or within a magnetic\nprimitive cell ).\nFirst, we present the data taken at 1.6 K in zero magnetic field. The ordering patterns which can\nreproduce the intensity distribution of Imag are shown for the Mo4- and Nd4- tetrahedra in Figs. 3(a) and\n3(b), respectively, where thick arrows indicate the directions of the magnetic moments and G indicates\nthe center of gravity of the tetrahedron. The net magnetizations MNd and MMo are along the [001] or\nother equivalent directions (We have chosen this to be the [001] direction (z axis) in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).).\nThe intensity distribution of Imag calculated for the pattern is listed in Table I. In the calculation, we\n4\n\n\fused the reported values of the magnetic form factors for Nd3+ moments,16) and for Mo4+, values\nexperimentally determined for MoF3 were used.17) The distribution probability of the ferromagnetic\ndomains among the three equivalent magnetization directions, [001], [010] and [100] is optimized.\nThe Mo-moments align along the direction nearly parallel to the z axis but have the slight tilting\nby the angle \u03b1 = 4( \u00b14 )$ from the z axis towards the corresponding local principal axes. The\nNd-moments are along the directions nearly parallel to their principal axes with their z-component\nbeing antiparallel to the z axis, but the possibility of the tilting by \u00b13$ from their principal axes cannot\nbe excluded. The results indicate that there exists the relatively strong axial anisotropy at the Nd sites.\nThe obtained magnetic ordering pattern indicates that the Mo-Mo and Mo-Nd interactions are\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, respectively. The values of the ordered atomic moments of Mo and\nNd, \u03bcMo and \u03bcNd, respectively, are estimated by comparing the magnetic scattering intensities with the\nnuclear ones, to be about 1.30( \u00b1 0.05) \u03bcB and 1.71( \u00b1 0.05) \u03bcB. The proposed ordering pattern does not\ncontradict the pattern at 4.0 K reported in refs. 5 and 6. In the temperature region of T\u226430 K, it is\nconsidered that \u03bcMo is almost T-independent and \u03bcNd increases with decreasing T. Considering the local\narrangement of the Nd-moments which surround a Mo site, we expect that the ordered Mo-moments are\ntilted by the Mo-Nd antiferromagnetic exchange interaction towards the direction opposite to the local\nprincipal one. Then, with decreasing T, the values of \u03b1 is expected to decrease.\nNow, the ordering pattern of Nd2Mo2O7 in the external magnetic field H(//[011]) is discussed. The\ndirection of the ordered Mo-moment at the i-th site, \u03bcMo,i (The indices i(=1-4)indicate the four corner sites\nwithin a tetrahedron as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b).) can be determined by the relation\n\n\u03bc Mo,i //( H + H Mo\u2190 Mo + H Mo\u2190Nd,i + H ani Mo )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H Mo\u2190 Mo and H Mo\u2190 Nd,i are the exchange fields from the surrounding Mo- and Nd-moments,\nrespectively. H ani\n\nMo\n\nis the effective magnetic field which describes the effect of the single ion anisotropy\n\nat the Mo-sites. The absolute value of \u03bcMo,i at 1.6 K is equal to be 1.30 \u03bcB and is considered to be\n\nH-independent. The absolute value of H Mo\u2190 Mo is estimated from the value of the Curie temperature\nTC=93 K, which is primarily due to the ordering of the Mo-moments, is to be ~67 T. The direction of the\nordered Nd-moment at the j-th site(j=1-4), \u03bcNd,j is fixed along the [111] or other equivalent directions, by\nconsidering that the Nd-moments are in the doublet levels and have the strong Ising-like anisotropy,\nwhere the absolute value of the ordered Nd-moment, \u03bcNd,j can be described by the equations,\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\uf8eb \u03bc Nd, j (T = 0) \u22c5 H Nd \u2190 Mo, j \u2212 H \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\u03bc Nd, j (T ) = \u03bc Nd, j (T = 0) \u22c5 tanh \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nkBT\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H Nd \u2190 Mo, j is the exchange field at the j-th Nd site from the surrounding Mo-moments. Because\nthe Weiss temperatures of Nd2Zr2O7 and Nd2GaSbO7, which have the Nd-Nd atomic distances similar to\nthat of Nd2Mo2O7, is smaller than 1 K18,19), we expect that the interaction among the Nd-moments in\nNd2Mo2O7 is considered to be negligible. The absolute value of the ordered moment of Nd, \u03bcNd,j at T=1.6\n5\n\n\fK is equal to be 1.71 \u03bcB. H Mo\u2190\n\u2190 Nd,i and H Nd \u2190 Mo, j can be described by the equations as,\nH Mo \u2190 Nd,i = J Mo \u2212 Nd \u2211 \u03bc Nd, j (T )\n\n(3)\n\nj\n\nH Nd \u2190 Mo, j= J Mo \u2212 Nd \u2211 \u03bc Mo,i (T )\n\n(4)\n\ni\n\nwhere JMo-Nd is the coupling constant between the Mo- and Nd-moments and the summations are taken\nover the nearest neighbor sites. The dipole-dipole interaction between the Mo- and Nd-moments is of the\norder of 0.1 K and can be neglected here. Schematic figures of the directions of these fields at the Moand Nd-sites are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. We have chosen the values of \u03bcNd,j (T=0),\n\nJMo-Nd and H ani Mo to reproduce the Imag data obtained at the Bragg points listed in Table I and to\nreproduce the H-dependence of Imag shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(e), where Imag is scaled by the nuclear\nscattering intensities: \u03bcNd,j(T=0)=1.93 \u03bcB, JMo-Nd=-0.39 \u03a4/\u03bcB and H ani Mo =7.6 T.\nOnce these values are determined, we can derive the magnetic structure of the present system for\narbitrary H and T. The obtained ordering patterns at 1.6 K in the magnetic field H \u2192 0 and H=5.7 T\nare shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively, where H \u2192 0 indicates that the magnetic field is\nextrapolated to zero from the relatively high magnetic field, and that the direction of the ferromagnetic\ncomponent is uniquely given. The \u03bcNd,j values (j=1-4) are shown against the magnetic field H at 1.6 K in\nFig. 5(c). Imag calculated for these patterns are shown against H in Figs. 2(a)-2(e) by solid lines. In the\ncalculation, the intensity average has been taken for crystallographically equivalent Bragg points in the\nscattering plane, the plane perpendicular to H, to consider the degrees of freedom of the domain\nstructure about the direction of H. The Mo-moments align along the direction nearly parallel to\n\nH(//[011]), but they are tilted from [011] direction by the H ani Mo and H Mo \u2190 Nd, i , with their tilting\ndirections and angles depending on H through H-dependence of the magnitude of \u03bcNd,j(T). The directions\nof \u03bcNd,j(j=1 and 3) are nearly H-independent as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), because their directions\n(parallel to the corresponding principal axes) are perpendicular to H and nearly perpendicular\nto H\n\nNd \u2190 Mo, j\n\n. The values of the ordered Nd-moment \u03bcNd,j (j=2 and 4) turn out, as shown in Fig. 5(c), to\n\nbecome zero at H=3.0 T, which can be considered to correspond to H Nd \u2190 Mo, j .\nIn Fig. 6, the M-H curves of a single crystal of Nd2Mo2O7 taken at various temperatures after the\nzero field cooling under the field H//[011] (or equivalently H//[110]), is shown together with those\ncalculated at 1.6 K and 3.0 K for the magnetic structure proposed above. We have found that the\ncalculated data is quantitatively consistent with the experimentally observed data, though the\ndifference is observed in the H-region of H \u2264 1 T, which arises from the fact that the calculated results\nare obtained for the magnetic state with the ferromagnetic component of all domains being aligned in\nthe direction of H.\nWe have derived the magnetic structure of Nd2Mo2O7 in the magnetic field H(//[011]) by using the\nrelations (1)-(4) and by using the values of \u03bcNd,j (T=0), JMo-Nd and H ani Mo deduced from the\nexperimental results. We have also derived the magnetic structures at 1.6 K under the conditions\n\nH//[001] and [111] for the same values of \u03bcNd,j (T=0), JMo-Nd and H ani Mo as those used above. We have\nfurther tried to determine the magnetic structures by using H ani\n6\n\nMo\n\n=0 instead of H ani\n\nMo\n\n=7.6 T, with\n\n\fkeeping \u03bcNd,j (T=0) and JMo-Nd unchanged, though the degree of agreement between the calculated and\nthe observed Imag distributions for H ani\n\nMo\n\n=0 is slightly worse than that for H ani\n\nMo\n\n=7.6 T.\n\nIn the above calculations, the rather strong Ising-like anisotropy of the Nd moments is essential to\nreproduce the observed H-dependence of the magnetic scattering intensities, where the ordered Nd\nmoment at T=0 \u03bcNd,j(T=0) is found to be smaller than the moment value g\u03bcBJ of the free Nd3+ ions(J=9/2).\nTo understand this results, we consider a doublet with the expectation values of the angular momentum\ncomponent along the principal axis, \u00b1\uf8f4J '\uf8f4( J '<J), where the strong anisotropy can be expected if the\nenergies of the lowest excited states are much larger than \u03bc Nd, j (T = 0) \u22c5 H and kBT. The components of\n\nJ perpendicular to the principal axis are considered not to have the ordering.\nIn Figs. 7(a)-7(c), the Hall resistivities \u03c1H of a single crystal of Nd2Mo2O7 are shown at various\ntemperatures against the magnetic fields H applied along the [110], [001] and [111] directions,\nrespectively,7,8,13) The authors' group reported that the H- and T- dependences of \u03c1H of Nd2Mo2O7 are\nquite unusual: The behaviors of \u03c1H are markedly different between the T-regions above and below \u223c30 K.\nBecause the total magnetization is determined by the sum of the net magnetizations MMo and MNd\nwhich have opposite signs in the weak field region, the enhancement of \u03c1H cannot be reproduced by the\nexpression \u03c1 H=R0H+4\u03c0RsM. Instead, the phenomenological expression \u03c1 H=R0H+4\u03c0RsMMo+4\u03c0Rs'MNd has\nbeen, as stated above, found to reproduce the results rather well, indicating that the perturbative\ntreatment is valid. However, any of the old theories cannot describe the T-dependence of the Hall\nresistivity \u03c1H of Nd2Mo2O7.\nOhgushi et al.13) and Taguchi et al.14) have proposed that the ordering of the spin chirality \u03c7\ncontributes to the Hall resistivity. According to this mechanism, the fictitious magnetic flux \u03c6 induced by\nthe spin chirality \u03c7 acts on the electron motion in the same way as the real magnetic field, where \u03c1 H\ncannot be treated by the perturbation of the spin-orbit interaction. The absolute value of the fictitious\nflux, \uf8f4\u03c6i\uf8f4(i=1\u223c4) is proportional to \u03c7i\u2261 Sj,\u2022 Sk \u00d7 Sl, where { j , k, l} being the i-th set of different numbers\nchosen in a cyclic way from 1-4 to specify the set of spins within a tetrahedron, and its direction is\ndefined as shown in Fig. 8 for \u03c61 for example. The total fictitious magnetic flux \u03a6 of the system is vector\nsum of \u03c61\u223c\u03c64. The anomalous Hall conductivity \u03c3H (=\u03c1H/ \u03c12) is proportional to the parallel component of \u03a6\nto the external magnetic field.\nThe fictitious magnetic flux of the Mo- and Nd-moments of Nd2Mo2O7, \u03a6\u039c\u03bf and \u03a6Nd, respectively,\nhas been calculated at 1.6 K as a function of H by using the H-dependent magnetic structure derived\nabove. Their parallel components to the external magnetic field H, \u03a6Mo// and \u03a6Nd//, are shown in Figs.\n9(a)-9(c), for the cases H//[110], [001] and [111], respectively. In the figures, the results obtained for both\nH ani\n\nMo\n\n=7.6 T and H ani\n\nMo\n\n=0 are plotted(Note that \u03a6Nd// hardly depend on the value of H ani\n\nMo\n\n.). Because\n\nthe electrical resistivity \u03c1 of Nd2Mo2O7 below \u223c60 K is almost T- and H-independet13,19) in the H-region of\nH \u2264 7 T, the Hall conductivity \u03c3H(=\u03c1H/ \u03c12)is nearly proportional to the Hall resistivity \u03c1H. It should be also\nnoted that \u03c1H does not significantly depend on T below 3 K.13) Then, according to the chiral order\nmechanism, the H-dependences of \u03a6Mo// and \u03a6Nd//, at 1.6 K shown in Figs 9(a)-9(c) should agree with\nthose of the Hall resistivity \u03c1H observed at 3 K, which are shown in Figs. 7(a)-7(c), respectively. However,\nwe cannot find the agreement in the figures: For H //[001], for example, the observed \u03c1H decreases\nmonotonically with increasing H, while the calculated \u03a6Mo// for H ani\n7\n\nMo\n\n=7.6 T increases with increasing\n\n\fH and \u03a6Mo// for H ani Mo =0 does not exhibits the strong decreasing behavior. ( We note here that the\nordinary Hall resistivity is not significantly large and its consideration does not change the above\narguments.) As stated above, the observed \u03c1\u0397-H curves can phenomenologically be described by using\ntwo degrees of freedom which contribute to the anomalous Hall resistivity \u03c1\u039713): One is proportional to\n\nMMo and the other is proportional to MNd. However, it is difficult to explain the observed \u03c1H data by the\nlinear combination of the components of \u03a6Mo// and \u03a6Nd//,\nNow, the T-dependence of the fictitious magnetic flux of the Mo- and Nd-moments, \u03a6Mo// and \u03a6Nd// is\ndiscussed. We calculate the fictitious flux by assuming that even at H=0, both of \u03a6Mo and \u03a6Nd , are\nparallel to the [001], or the ferromagnetic domains are aligned. Figure 10(a) shows their absolute values\nat H=0 divided by the corresponding value at 1.6 K. In the calculation, the ordered Nd-moments \u03bcNd,j(T)\nhas been estimated from the temperature dependence of the observed magnetic scattering intensity Imag\nof the 111 reflection shown in the inset of Fig. 10(a). For H ani Mo =7.6 T, \u03a6Mo// decreases with decreasing T\nin contrast to that at H ani Mo =0. Figure 10(b) shows the T-dependence of the Hall resistivity \u03c1H of\nNd2Mo2O7 taken under the relatively weak magnetic field H=0.5 T along the [001] direction. Because at\n\nH=0.5 T, the magnetic domains are aligned but the magnetic structure is not significantly changed from\nthat at H=0, the observed \u03c1H can be compared with the above calculated results at H=0. We find,\nhowever, that the T-dependences of \u03a6Mo// and \u03a6Nd//, are quite different from that of the observed Hall\nresistivity as shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), irrespective of the choice of the value of H ani\n\nMo\n\n. Thus, the\n\nT- and H-dependences of the fictitious magnetic flux deduced from the proposed magnetic structure do\nnot agree with that of the observed Hall resistivity \u03c1H of Nd2Mo2O7, indicating that unusual behavior of\n\n\u03c1H is not explained only by the chiral order mechanism.\nIn the above calculations of the fictitious magnetic flux, we have estimated the ordered Nd-moments\n\n\u03bcNd,j by using the mean field approximation. The problem might remain whether the spin chirality or\nthe fictitious magnetic flux defined by the local arrangement of moments could properly be obtained\nfrom this \u03bcNd,j. For example, even in the case where H ani\n\nMo\n\n=0 and \u03bcNd,j =0, non-zero \u03a6Mo// is induced\n\nthrough the exchange interaction of Mo- and Nd-moments, if only the Mo-moments are\nferromagnetically ordered. However, the value of \u03a6Mo// induced in the situation is too small(by a factor of\n~1/50) to explain the \u03c1H value observed in the region of T>40 K. Then, it is very difficult to expect\nsignificant effects of the local fluctuation of the chirality to the behavior of \u03c1H. The observed behavior of\n\n\u03c1H of the present system cannot be understood by considering the chiral order as the main mechanism of\nthe Hall transport.\nIn summary, we have shown the neutron scattering data taken for a single crystal of Nd2Mo2O7 in\nthe T-region from 1.6 K to 150 K (>TC) and under the magnetic field up to 5.7 T applied along the [011]\ndirection. The magnetic structure in the applied magnetic field 0\u2264H \u22645.7 T is derived by estimating the\nexchange coupling constant between the Mo- and Nd-moments and by considering the single ion\nanisotropies of each Mo- and Nd-moments. From the proposed magnetic structure, the fictitious\nmagnetic flux of the Mo- and Nd-moments has been calculated as functions of T and H and compared\nwith the observed data of the Hall resistivity \u03c1H. The results indicate that the chiral order mechanism is\nnot, at least, playing a main role in determining the observed behavior of \u03c1H in the present system.\n\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Prof. Nagaosa of the University of Tokyo for stimulating discussion.
