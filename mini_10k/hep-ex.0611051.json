Introduction\n\no\n\n90\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nS\n\nTUDIES of angular and energy dependence of muon\nflux at the Earth's surface give important information\nas about processes of muon generation and propagation in\nthe atmosphere so about primary cosmic rays. Measurements of muon flux at large zenith angles up to 90\u25e6 are\nespecially actual since primary particles for such muons\nhave higher energies than in the vertical direction. Experimental studies of muon intensity at large zenith angles at the ground level can be conditionally separated in\ntwo groups: measurements of muon integral intensity with\nthreshold energies less than 1 GeV [1]\u2013[8] and investigations of integral and differential muon spectra for muon\nenergies higher than 10 GeV (see review [9]). Regions of\nmeasurements of muon spectrum at large zenith angles are\npresented in Fig. 1. It is remarkable that for threshold energies from 1 GeV to 10 GeV and zenith angles 60\u25e6 \u2264\u03b8\u226490\u25e6\nmuon intensity data are absent.\nTo explore this region, a setup capable to measure nearhorizontal muon flux at different threshold energies with a\ngood angular accuracy of track reconstruction is needed.\nCoordinate detector DECOR, which is a part of experimental complex NEVOD situated in MEPhI (Moscow), is\nsuch a detector.

Experimental setup and events selection\nExperimental complex NEVOD includes a water\nCherenkov calorimeter NEVOD [10] with sensitive volume\n2000 m3 equipped with quasispherical modules of PMTs,\nand large-area (\u223c 110 m2 ) coordinate detector DECOR\n[11] (Fig. 2). Eight supermodules (SM) of DECOR are\nsituated in the gallery around the water tank, and four\nSM on its cover. SM of side part of DECOR represents\neight parallel planes with sensitive area 3.1 m \u00d7 2.7 m,\nsuspended vertically with 6 cm distance from each other.\nThese planes consist of 16 chambers which contain 16 tubes\nwith inner cross-section 0.9 cm \u00d7 0.9 cm. Chambers are\noperated in a limited streamer mode and are equipped with\ntwo-coordinate external strip read-out system. Thus, coordinates of passing particle can be obtained for each plane\nwith spatial accuracy of muon track location \u223c 1 cm. First\nlevel trigger is formed when there are at least two even and\ntwo odd triggered planes in a given SM.\nFor the analysis, particles passing through two SM situated at different sides of the water pool were selected. Different pairs of SM correspond to different values of threshold energy. Accuracy of zenith angle reconstruction for\n\n\f2\n\n0.91 for different \u03b8 and Emin (uncertainty of \u03b5add is less\nthen 0.35%). The function S\u03a9(\u03b8, \u03c6, Emin ) is the setup acceptance calculated by means of MC method taking into\naccount the structure of SM and selection requirements.\nAbsolute muon intensity averaged in azimuth angle for\nzenith angles 61\u25e6 \u2264\u03b8\u226489\u25e6 and for five threshold energies is\nrepresented in Table I and is shown in Fig. 3 (points). Errors in the table include statistical and systematical uncertainties (uncertainty of threshold energy estimation, uncertainty of \u03b5SM , muon energy loss in the walls of surrounding\nbuildings).\n\nDECOR-T\nNEVOD\n9m\n\nDECOR-S\n26\n\nm\n\n9m\ns sr)\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n\u25e6\n\nThreshold energy Emin of muons passing through selected pair of SM is calculated by means of range-energy\ntables [12].

The bin of\nzenith angle \u2206\u03b8 = 1\u25e6 , the bin of azimuth angle \u2206\u03c6 = 0.5\u25e6 ,\nthe bin of threshold energy Emin = 250 MeV.

Ecr = z0 *m/(c*\u03c40 * cos \u03b8\u2217 ) is the effective critical energy for muon; z0 is the effective length at which\nthe density of atmosphere is changed by a factor of e [13];\nc is the velocity of light; \u03c40 is muon life time and m is\nit's mass (GeV); cos \u03b8\u2217 = (cos\u03b1 \u03b8 + \u2206\u03b1 )1/\u03b1 is the approximation of effect of atmosphere sphericity. As a result of\nfitting, the following values of free parameters were obtained: CI = 0.103, \u03b3 = 1.963, z0 = 6.81 km, \u2206 = 0.0577\nand \u03b1 = 1.35.\nIn Fig. 3, integral muon intensity calculated by formula\n(2) for five threshold energies (the curves) is compared\nwith the present experimental data. Dependence of integral muon intensity on zenith angle calculated for lower\nthresholds (1 and 0.3 GeV) and experimental data of earlier measurements [1]\u2013[8] are presented in Fig. 4. Comparison of calculated values with data [1,4,5,7,8] shows a\nreasonable agreement. In works [2] and [6], the intensity is\nsomewhat higher than measured in [1] or calculated by (2).\nThe integral intensity data at Emin = 1 GeV obtained in [3]\ndecrease with the increase of zenith angle more slowly than\nit follows from [1] and calculation by (2), but at angles less\nthan 72\u25e6 the agreement is quite well.\nV.

It is important to mark that the measurements for all thresholds were performed simultaneously\nwith a single setup, that minimizes systematic uncertainties. Extrapolation of the present data to lower thresholds\nis in a reasonable agreement with the results of other measurements.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research is performed at the Experimental Complex\nNEVOD with the support of the Federal Agency of Education and Federal Agency for Science and Innovations (contracts 02.452.11.7064, 02.434.11.7039; program of support\nof leading scientific schools 10113.2006.2).\nReferences\n[1] B.G.
