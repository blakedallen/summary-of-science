[1]\nfor a recent review) is of great current interest in connection with experimental studies of nuclei far from stability conducted at heavy-ion and radioactive\nion-beam facilities and with the theory of nucleosynthesis and supernova explosions [2]. The spectrum of global mass models ranges from those with high\ntheoretical input that explicitly take account of known physical principles in\nterms of a relatively small number of fitting parameters, to models that are\nshaped only by the data and thus have a correspondingly large number of\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n16 January 2018\n\n\fadjustable parameters. Current models of the former class that define the\nstate of the art are the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM) of M\u00f6ller, Nix,\nand coworkers [3] and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model (HFB2) of Pearson,\nTondeur and coworkers [4]. Statistical models based on neural networks are\nsituated far toward the other end of the spectrum. They have been under continuing development in recent years, to the extent that they can now provide\na valuable complement to conventional global models [5].\nHere we provide a preliminary report of results from a synthesis [6] of the two\napproaches. Training by example, a neural network is constructed that estimates the differences \u2206M exp \u2212 \u2206M FRDM between experiment and the FRDM,\nwhere \u2206M denotes the nuclidic mass excess. Combining the FRDM with this\nneural network, we obtain a hybrid global mass model that performs with\nprecision both in reproducing \u2206M values for familiar nuclei and predicting\nthem for new nuclei. This strategy is pursued with the hope of determining\nwhether the residual physical corrections to the FRDM model (a) stem from\na large number of small effects that may fluctuate strongly with Z and N,\ndefying systematic quantification, or instead (b) can be attributed in part to\nregularities of nuclear structure not yet embodied in theory.\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\nZ\n\nLearning set - M1 (1276 nuclei)\nValidation set - M2 (344 nuclei)\nPrediction set -M3 (529 nuclei)\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nN\n\nFig. 1. Locations in the N \u2212 Z plane are indicated for the M1, M2, and M3 data\nsets employed in neural-network modeling of the differences between experimental\nmass-excess values and those given by the FRDM.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nNeural-network model of the mass differences\n\nA multilayer feedforward architecture is adopted for the neural network, having the structure indicated schematically by (4\u20136\u20136\u20136\u20131)[169]. The four input units encode the atomic number Z, the neutron number N, and their\nrespective parities. The single output unit encodes the mass-excess difference\n\u2206M exp \u2212\u2206M FRDM . Three intermediate layers, each containing six units, transfer information from input to output through weighted connections. The total\nnumber of weight parameters charactering the network is 169. To construct\nthe neural-network model, we have employed the database of 1654 nuclei fitted\nby the FRDM parameterization of Ref. [3], screening out some uncertain cases\nin light of the more recent experimental mass-excess assignments published in\nthe 2003 Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME03) [7]. The surviving 1620 nuclei are\ndivided randomly into two data sets of 1276 (M1) and 344 (M2) nuclei, which\nrespectively comprise the learning and validation sets for neural-network modeling. Performance on the learning set serves as the criterion for progressive\nadjustment of the weights of the feedforward connections, while performance\non the validation set is used to guide the termination of training. To obtain\nan unambiguous measure of predictive performance, some of the data must be\nreserved as a test set, or prediction set, which is never referred to during the\ntraining process. The test set (denoted M3) is provided by the remaining 529\nnuclei of the AME03 evaluation. These data points correspond predominantly\nto nuclides far from stability, lying on the outer fringes of the 1620-nuclide set\nM1 \u222a M2 as viewed in the N \u2212 Z plane (see Fig. 1). The ability of the neural\nnetwork to model the difference \u2206M exp \u2212 \u2206M FRDM is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\u0003\n\u0002-1\n\nexperiment\n\n-\n\nprediction\n\n(MeV)\n\n3\n\n-2\nFRDM\n\n\u0001-3\n\nNeural network\n\n-4\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nN\n\nFig. 2. Mass-excess differences between experiment and FRDM for the data sets\nM1 and M2 involved in the training process are compared with the corresponding\ndifferences predicted by the neural network.\n\n3\n\n\fIt is seen that the deviations of the FRDM evaluation from experiment for\nthe data sets M1 and M2 involved in the training process can be substantially\nreproduced by the neural network.\n3\n\nMass excess evaluation \u2013 Hybrid Model\n\nTo generate and predict mass-excess values for nuclides of specified Z and\nN, we construct a hybrid model by combining the FRDM outputs with the\ndifference values predicted by the neural-network model described in Section\n2. In Table 1 we compare performance (measured by the rms error \u03c3rms ) on\nthe learning, validation, and prediction sets for (i) the hybrid model, (ii) the\nneural-network mass model of Ref. [5] and its most recent version [6] and (iii)\nthe theoretical models FRDM [3] and HFB2 [4]. The neural-network mass\nmodels of Refs. [5,6] were trained to directly predict mass-excess values (as\nopposed to differences of mass-excess values). Likewise, the FRDM and HFB2\nmodels were fitted to mass-excess data.\nOverall, the hybrid model shows the best performance among the four models considered, having very small error figures even for the prediction set M3.\nFurther insight into the behavior of the hybrid model of mass excess is furnished by Fig. 3, where the rms error of the difference estimate per isotope\nchain, i.e., calculated for all N for given Z, is plotted for the full database\nM1 \u222a M2 \u222a M3. For the majority of chains, the hybrid model yields smaller\nerrors than FRDM and HFB2.\n\n4\n\nMass-related nuclear quantities \u2013 Hybrid Model\n\nMass-related quantities of interest can also be evaluated based on the various\nmodels of mass excess, statistical and theoretical.

At this stage one is naturally led to inquire\nwhether the residual errors are \"chaotic\" or random in nature, arising from\nthe fluctuation and interplay of a large number of small physical effects as\nwell as some experimental error. We have addressed this question by creating\na neural-network model that generates the difference between experimental\nmass excesses and the values given by a state-of-the-art global mass model,\nspecifically, the Finite Range Droplet Model of M\u00f6ller, Nix, and coworkers\n[3]. Our results suggest that a significant portion of the residual error (perhaps 30-40%) can be treated systematically, i.e., some regularities remain to\nbe extracted from the data. More extensive neural-network studies aimed at\nrevealing the statistical behavior of the discrepancy are needed to test this\ninference.\nThe present work has shown that hybrid models built by supplementing the\nFRDM evaluation with a trained neural network show promise of accurate\nprediction of atomic masses far from stability, as well as other nuclear properties required as input for theories of nucleosynthesis and supernova explosions.\nTable 3\nPerformance of global mass models for various quantities related to nuclear-mass\nsystematics, quantified by the corresponding rms error over all cases involving only\nnuclides of the prediction set M3.
