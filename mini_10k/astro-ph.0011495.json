Introduction\nOne of the most fundamental predictions of a theory of\nstructure formation is the number density of objects of\na given mass, the mass function, at a given redshift. Accurate mass functions are used in a number of areas in\ncosmology; in studies of galaxy formation, in measures of\nvolumes (e.g. galaxy lensing) and in attempts to infer the\nnormalization of the power spectrum and the density parameter from the abundance of rich clusters. In the latter\ncase the mass function is the point of contact allowing\nus to bootstrap the excellent statistics of large N-body\nsimulations with observable properties of clusters normalized for example by hydrodynamic simulations of smaller\nvolumes. In this way we can obtain reliable estimates of\ne.g. the number of clusters as a function of temperature\nand redshift, which can in turn be used to constrain the\nmatter density, the normalization of the power spectrum\nand the statistics of the initial density field.\nSeveral different definitions for the \"mass\" of a halo\nare in common use, each having different advantages. For\n\nexample there are at least 3 different definitions of mass\nfor the mass-temperature relation as computed from hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and all are\ndifferent from the definition of mass commonly used in\nthe mass function which is itself different from the mass\nusually employed in analytic studies based on the PressSchechter (1974; hereafter PS) theory. Observational data\nhave improved to the point where it is important to distinguish between these different definitions of mass, lest\nwe bias our theoretical predictions. We give an example\nof how such a conversion can be made, at least approximately, for a certain class of mass estimator.\n2. Halo mass definitions\nIn this section we describe some of the definitions of the\nmass of a dark matter halo in common use. This list is obviously not exhaustive, but it is representative. We begin\nby recalling some background about the spherical top-hat\ncollapse model (see e.g. Peebles 1993; Peacock 1999; Liddle & Lyth 2000, and references therein) from which much\nof the language in this field has been borrowed.\nThe spherical top-hat ansatz describes the formation of\na collapsed object by solving for the evolution of a sphere\nof uniform overdensity \u03b4 in a smooth background of density \u03c1\u0304. By Birkhoff's theorem the overdense region evolves\nas a positively curved Friedman universe whose expansion\nrate is initially matched to that of the background. The\noverdensity at first expands but because it is overdense the\nexpansion slows (relative to the background) and eventually halts before the region begins to recollapse. Technically the collapse proceeds to a singularity but it is assumed in a \"real\" object virialization occurs at twice1 the\nturn-around time, resulting in a sphere of half the turnaround radius. In an Einstein-de Sitter model the overdensity (relative to the critical density) at virialization is\n\u2206c = 18\u03c0 2 \u2243 178. We shall always use \u2206c to indicate the\noverdensity relative to critical of a virialized halo, which\nwill be lower for smaller \u03a9M . Note that some authors use a\ndifferent convention in which \u2206c is specified relative to the\n1\n\nThere is a small correction to this in the presence of a\ncosmological constant which contributes a \u039br 2 potential.\n\n\f2\n\nMartin White: The mass of a halo\n\nFig. 1. The relations between various definitions of the\nmass of a halo as a function of \u03a9M assuming the halo\ndensity profile follows the NFW form with concentration\nparameter c = 5.\nbackground matter density \u2013 our \u2206c is \u03a9M times theirs.\nThe linear theory extrapolation of this overdensity is normally denoted \u03b4c and is (3/20)(12\u03c0)2/3 \u2243 1.686 in an\nEinstein-de Sitter model. This overdensity is often used\nas a threshold parameter in PS theory and its extensions\nand has a very weak cosmology dependence which is often\nneglected.\nWe now turn to some of the definitions of mass in use\nin the literature. Let us suppose that we have identified\nsome object, a problem to which we shall return in \u00a74,\nand have chosen a fiducial 'center' about which to take\nspherically averaged profiles. We define M\u2206 as the mass\ncontained within a radius r\u2206 inside of which the mean\ninterior density is \u2206 times the critical density\nZ r\u2206\n\u2206\n3\nr2 dr \u03c1(r) = \u03c1crit r\u2206\n.\n(1)\n3\n0\nThe 'virial mass' from the spherical top-hat collapse model\nwould then be simply M\u2206c . We shall refer to this mass as\nMth\u2212vir .\nAn alternative interpretation of the spherical collapse\nmodel is that the virial radius corresponds to that point\nwithin which the material is virialized and external to\nwhich the mass is still collapsing onto the object. Some\nsimulations suggest that this occurs at \u2206 = 200 more or\nless independent of cosmology, and so a common mass estimator is M200 which is approximately the virial mass if\n\u03a9M = 1. Authors also use M500 or M1000 in some applications.\nThe final mass estimator we shall consider is the one\nused by Jenkins et al. (2000) in their analysis of simulations performed by the Virgo consortium. The mass they\n\nFig. 2. Correlations between two estimators of the mass,\nMfof0.2 and M200 , in simulations of a \u039bCDM model (see\ntext). Only halos with more than 1000 particle are used.\nThe upper panel shows that the different estimates of mass\nare correlated, but offset (the dotted line marks y = x).\nThe dashed line indicates the prediction for the offset of\n\u00a73. The lower panel shows the mass ratios as a function of\nM200 on a linear scale.\nassign to a halo is simply the sum of the masses of the\nparticles identified as members of the halo by their halo\nfinder. This mass estimator is the least easily interpreted\ntheoretically, though it is well defined algorithmically, but\nhas the very convenient feature that the mass function for\nthis estimator is independent of cosmology!\nUnfortunately there is no unique algorithmic definition of a dark matter halo, even within a 3D simulation\nitself. To define the mass of an object we must first specify\nthe object in question! Although other halo finders are in\ncommon use, we shall deal exclusively with halos found using the Friends-of-Friends (Davis et al. 1985) algorithm,\nhereafter called FOF. Our reason for this choice is that\nit is the group finder employed by the Virgo consortium\nin deriving the mass functions from their very large Nbody simulations (Jenkins et al. 2000) and in terms of\nwhich they find a universal mass function. The FOF algorithm has one free parameter, b, the linking length in\nunits of the mean inter-particle spacing. Commonly used\nvalues of b are 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2, although other choices\nexist (e.g. Gardner 2000 chooses instead b\u22123 = \u03a9M \u2206c /3).\nJenkins et al. (2000) find that the mass function is universal if they take b = 0.2, independent of the cosmology\nunder consideration. Jenkins et al.

We\nshall return to this point in \u00a74.\nIn the next sections we describe how these different\nmasses are related.\n3. An approximate conversion\nIt would be advantageous if we could convert, at least\napproximately, between the different definitions of mass\nin common use. In this section we make a first attempt\nin this direction. We assume that all halos are spherical\nand have a universal profile, for example2 the NFW form\n(Navarro, Frenk & White 1996):\n\u22122\n\n\u03c1(r) \u221d x\u22121 (1 + x)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x = r/rs and rs is a scale radius usually specified in\nterms of the concentration parameter c \u2261 r200 /rs . Navarro\net al. (1996) refer to r200 and M200 throughout as the\n'virial radius' and 'virial mass' respectively. Again, N-body\nsimulations have shown that the concentration parameter\nis a weak function of virial mass, taking the value c \u223c 5 for\nmasses characteristic of clusters which shall be our focus\nhere.\nWith a given profile it is straightforward to relate the\nvarious mass definitions as shown in Fig. 1. Note that\nthe masses can differ significantly in this model and that\nthe cosmology dependence is quite strong. How well does\nthis crude model predict the relationship between different\nmass definitions in practice?\n4. Simulations\nThe model of the previous section made several approximations. To compare these different mass estimates with\neach other more carefully we have used some N-body simulations, originally run for another purpose. We simulated\nthe Ostriker & Steinhardt (1995) concordance model,\nwhich has \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 100 h kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n2\n\nThere is some controversy in the literature about the slope\nof the density profile as r \u2192 0. Luckily departures from the\nNFW form are expected to occur only at very small radii, containing a vanishingly small amount of the total mass, and thus\ndo not concern us here.\n\n3\n\nwith h = 0.67, \u03a9B = 0.04, n = 1 and \u03c38 = 0.9 (corresponding to \u03b4H = 5.02 \u00d7 10\u22125 ). For this cosmology\n\u2206c \u2243 101 from the top-hat collapse model.\nWe have used two 'high' resolution and two lower resolution N-body simulations. The first was a 2563 particle,\ndark matter only simulation in a 1003 h\u22121 Mpc box. The\nsimulation was run on 16 processors of the Origin2000 at\nNCSA with the TreePM-SPH code (White et al. 2000) operating in collisionless (dark matter only) mode. The gravitational force softening was of a spline form (e.g. Hernquist & Katz 1989), with a \"Plummer-equivalent\" softening length of 15 h\u22121 kpc comoving. The simulation was\nevolved from z = 100 until the present and took a total of 1300 (normalized) CPU hours. A second 2563 particle simulation was run from z = 70 in a 256 h\u22121Mpc\nbox with a 35 h\u22121 kpc softening. This run took a total of\n880 (normalized) CPU hours, also on 16 processors. To\nprovide additional statistics on the high-mass end of the\nmass function we additionally ran several smaller (1283\nparticles) simulations of the same model in boxes of side\n200 h\u22121Mpc.\nFrom the z = 0 outputs we generated group catalogues\nusing the FOF algorithm with b = 0.2. For each halo we\ndefined the center for our spherical averages as the particle with the minimum potential energy. This corresponds\nclosely to the most bound particle and the density peak for\na halo in all but the most disturbed systems, and is more\nrobust than the center of mass. With the group catalog\nand centers so defined it is straightforward to calculate\neach of the estimators described above. Throughout we\nshall use M200 as our \"base\" mass to which the others are\ncompared, since this fits best into the philosophy of \u00a73.\nWe show in Fig. 2 that the different mass estimators\nare indeed highly correlated as one would expect (see also\nTable 1). The ratio of the FOF mass to M200 is seen to\nspan a reasonable range and be offset from unity by a nonnegligible amount. Fig. 3 shows a histogram of the ratio\nof Mfof0.2 and Mth\u2212vir to M200 for all of the halos above\na given number of particles.\nLet us focus first on Mth\u2212vir . The shape of the histogram is roughly the same regardless of particle number\nindicating that the distribution is not strongly affected\nby finite particle numbers in the halos chosen. The tophat virial mass and M200 are fairly tightly correlated, as\none might expect since they are both spherically averaged\nstatistics and the density contrasts are not too different.\nThe approximation of \u00a73 provides a reasonable estimate of\nthe ratio of masses, presumably because of the spherical\naveraging being performed.\nThe situation with regards Mfof0.2 is more complicated. Firstly the scatter is much larger, since the groups\nfound by FOF can be quite irregularly shaped (see Fig. 4).\nThe actual ratio of Mfof0.2 to M200 is larger than predicted\nby our model. By eye the halo finder looks to have merged\nclose groups. It is possible that with better mass resolution this would occur to a lesser extent, although the lack\n\n\f4\n\nMartin White: The mass of a halo\n\nFig. 3. Distribution of mass ratios for halos from the first simulation. The solid line shows all halos with more than\n500 particles, the dashed line 1000 particles and the dotted line 2000 particles. The ratios predicted by the model of\n\u00a73 are Mfof0.2 /M200 = 1.07 and Mth\u2212vir /M200 = 1.22.\nof a clear trend with particle number in Fig. 3 argues that\nconvergence would be quite slow.\nTo investigate whether FOF has merged adjacent halos\nand whether a FOF halo can be considered as all particles\nabove a given density threshold (as assumed in \u00a73) we\nhave examined the particles in the two groups of Fig. 4.\nFor each particle we calculate its distance from the halo\ncenter and its density, defined from the distance (rneig ) to\nthe 32nd nearest neighbour3 as\n\u03c1\u2261\n\n3M \u22123\nr\n4\u03c0 neigh\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M is the enclosed mass. This density estimate is\nsomewhat noisy, but will be sufficiently accurate for our\npurposes.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5 along with the appropriate NFW profile (assuming c = 5) for comparison. Note\nthat the substructure in the halos is readily apparent as\ndensity 'spikes' as functions of radius and can be matched\nto 'sub-halos' in Fig. 4.\nIt is clear from Fig. 5 that FOF is (at least approximately) linking all particles above a density \u03a9M b\u22123 of critical. However the chosen contrast is low enough that this\nincludes particles well outside r200 (or the virial radius)\nand the presence of these 'nearby' particles is biasing the\nmasses above M200 and contributing to the extra scatter.\nThis problem could be mitigated to some extent by reducing b, but it is not clear whether the mass function would\nremain universal if a different (cosmology independent) b\nwere chosen.\n3\n\nWe use all of the particles in the simulation, not just group\nmembers, in computing rneig .\n\nFinally we show in Fig. 6 the different mass functions\nthat would be derived from these halos using the 3 different mass definitions. Note that our results, obtained with\na completely independent N-body code and analyzed with\na completely independent set of software, agree well with\nthe universal mass function of Jenkins et al. (2000). However, especially at the high mass end, the number density\nis quite sensitive to the mass definition used. Intriguingly\nthe fitting formula quoted by Jenkins et al. (2000) provides a good fit to the mass function if we use Mth\u2212vir as\nour definition of mass, an even better fit than if we use\nMfof0.2 .\n\n5. An example: the temperature function\nAn example of where this mass uncertainty may be important is in using the observed temperature function of\nlocal X-ray clusters to constrain the normalization of the\npresent day power spectrum. Although Pen (1998) has\nargued for a direct prediction of the temperature function from simulations, most people use a hybrid approach\nin obtaining this constraint. First a mass function, usually calibrated by simulations such as those of Jenkins et\nal. (2000), is assumed and then a mass temperature relation from hydrodynamic simulations is used to predict the\ntemperature function.\nHydrodynamic simulations show good agreement for\nthe total mass and X-ray temperature properties of clusters (e.g. Frenk et al. 1999). The mass-temperature relation from these simulations generally follows the virial\n\n\fMartin White: The mass of a halo\n\n5\n\nFig. 5.

Unfortunately this alone\ndoes not account for all of the discrepancy.\nTo take only two relations as examples, Evrard, Metzler & Navarro (1996) define the mass in Eq. 4 as M200 .\nThe M of Bryan & Norman (1998), on the other hand,\nis the 'virial' mass in the sense of the spherical top-hat\nmodel. In both cases there is ample justification for the\ndefinition chosen, and the authors are explicit about their\nchoice. However, there is an \u03a9M dependent ratio between\nthese two definitions which cannot be neglected if the temperature function is to be predicted to the factor of 2 level!\n6. Conclusions\nWe have shown that different definitions of the \"mass\" of\na halo exist, and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nIt is important to be consistent when combining relations\nwhich use different definitions of mass, and we have given\nan approximate method for converting between some commonly used mass estimators. Mass estimates based on\nspherical averages are much more tightly correlated with\neach other than with the mass obtained simply by summing the particles in the group, and can be quite well\nestimated by assuming a 'universal' spherical profile (\u00a73).\nThe hydrodynamical simulations which calibrate observables as a function of cluster mass typically use such a\nspherically averaged mass definition.\nUnfortunately these definitions are not very tightly\ncorrelated with the particle based mass used in the universal mass function of halos reported by Jenkins et\nal. (2000). We have argued that this is because, with a\nlinking length of b = 0.2, FOF is merging neighbouring\nhalos. Such a problem would be mitigated by reducing b,\nbut it has not been demonstrated that the mass function\nis universal for b 6= 0.2.\nIn the cosmological model we have simulated, the fitting form of Jenkins et al. (2000) provides a good match\nto the mass function of our halos, strengthening the claim\nof those authors that it is universal. However we find the\nbest fit when the mass estimator used is the top-hat virial\nmass, rather than the FOF mass. While we have not investigated other cosmological models, we expect that the\nprofiles (from the point of view of estimating masses) will\nnot be very cosmology dependent. It would be interesting\nto see whether the Jenkins et al. (2000) mass function is\n'universal' if one uses the (cosmology dependent) top-hat\nvirial mass of the halos.\nI would like to thank V.
