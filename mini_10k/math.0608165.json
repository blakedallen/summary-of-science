LANDIM, A. MILAN\u00c9S, S. OLLA\nAbstract. We prove nonequilibrium fluctuations for the boundary driven\nsymmetric simple exclusion process. We deduce from this result the stationary\nfluctuations.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the last years there has been considerable progress in understanding stationary\nnon equilibrium states (SNS): reversible systems in contact with reservoirs imposing\na gradient on the conserved quantities of the system. In particular, large deviation\nproperties has been studied for boundary driven one-dimensional symmetric simple\nexclusion processes ([1, 4] and references therein).\nOne of the most striking typical property of SNS is the presence of long-range\ncorrelations. For the symmetric simple exclusion this was already shown by H.\nSpohn in the pioneering paper [10]. But we noticed that a mathematical proof of\nthe convergence of the fluctuation fields to the corresponding Gaussian field was\nmissing from the literature. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap.\nWe consider the symmetric exclusion process in an open lattice of length N.\nParticles jumps to nearest neighbors performing simple symmetric random walks\nwith the exclusion rule: a jump is suppressed if site is already occupied. At the left\nboundary particles are created with rate \u03b1 and annihilated with rate 1 \u2212 \u03b1. On the\nright boundary this is done with rates \u03b2 and 1 \u2212 \u03b2. To keep notation simple we\nrestrict to the one dimensional nearest neighbor case. Extensions to more dimension\nand more general jumps rates is straightforward (see remarks 2.2 and 2.3).\nIf \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03c1, the Bernoulli product measure with probability \u03c1 is stationary\nand reversible for the dynamics. But when \u03b1 6= \u03b2 the stationary measure has\ncorrelations and is not explicitly computable. We denote by \u03b7(x) = 0 or 1 the\noccupation variable of site x. It is easy to prove that < \u03b7([N u]) >ss \u2192 \u03c1\u0304(u) =\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)u + \u03b1.\nThe fluctuation field is formally defined as the random distribution on [0, 1]\nN \u22121\n1 X\n\u03b4(u \u2212 x/N )(\u03b7(x) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(u)) .\nY N (u) = \u221a\nN x=1\n\n(1.1)\n\nDate: September 11, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60K35, 82C22.\nKey words and phrases.

LANDIM, A. MILAN\u00c9S, S. OLLA\n\nWe prove in this paper that, under the stationary measure for the process, Y N\nconverges in law to the centered Gaussian field Y on [0, 1] with covariance\n< Y (u)Y (v) > = \u03c7(\u03c1\u0304(u))\u03b4(u \u2212 v) \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)2 (\u2212\u2206)\u22121 (u, v) ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and \u03c7(\u03c1) =\n\u03c1(1\u2212\u03c1). In the 1-dimensional case we have more explicitly (\u2212\u2206)\u22121 (u, v) = u(1\u2212v).\nThe strategy we use to prove this result is to study first the convergence of the\nnonstationary fluctuations. If we start with some non-equilibrium density profile\n< \u03b70 ([N u]) >= \u03c1(0, u), then at the diffusive time scale we have < \u03b7N 2 t ([N u]) >\u2192\n\u03c1(t, u), where \u03c1(t, u) is solution of the heat equation with initial condition \u03c1(0, u).\nWe then consider the time-dependent fluctuation field\nN \u22121\n1 X\n\u03b4(u \u2212 x/N )(\u03b7N 2 t (x) \u2212 \u03c1(t, u)).\nY N (t, u) = \u221a\nN x=1\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe main point of the proof is to show the convergence of Y N (u, t) to the solution\nof the stochastic linear partial differential equation\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u2202t Y (t, u) = \u2206Y (t, u) \u2212 \u2207\n2\u03c7(\u03c1(t, u)) W (t, u) ,\n(1.4)\n\nwhere W (t, u) is the standard space-time white noise. If we start in the stationary\nstate, \u03c1(t, u) = \u03c1\u0304(u) for all t. In this case the distribution valued process Y (t, u) is a\nstationary Gaussian process and its invariant distribution is given by the Gaussian\nfield Y with covariance given by (1.2).\nThis article presents a rigorous proof of the results described above and presented\nin [4]. Article [4] also contains the connection between the large deviations and the\nsmall fluctuations proved here, showing that the inverse of the covariance (1.2) is\ngiven by the second functional derivative of the large deviations rate function.\n2. Notation and results\nFor N \u2265 1, let \u039bN = {1, . . . , N \u2212 1}. Fix 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1 and consider the\nboundary driven symmetric simple exclusion process associated to \u03b1, \u03b2. This is the\nMarkov process on {0, 1}\u039bN whose generator LN is given by\n(LN f )(\u03b7)\n\n=\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\nx=1\n\n{f (\u03c3 x,x+1 \u03b7) \u2212 f (\u03b7)}\n\no\n\u03b1[1 \u2212 \u03b7(1)] + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b7(1) {f (\u03c3 1 \u03b7) \u2212 f (\u03b7)}\nn\no\n+\n\u03b2[1 \u2212 \u03b7(N \u2212 1)] + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b7(N \u2212 1) {f (\u03c3 N \u22121 \u03b7) \u2212 f (\u03b7)} .\n+\n\nn\n\nIn this formula, \u03b7 = {\u03b7(x), x \u2208 \u039bN } is a configuration of the state space {0, 1}\u039bN\nso that \u03b7(x) = 0 if and only if site x is vacant for \u03b7; \u03c3 x,y \u03b7 is the configuration\nobtained from \u03b7 by interchanging the occupation variables \u03b7(x), \u03b7(y):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03b7(z) if z 6= x, y ,\n(\u03c3 x,y \u03b7)(z) =\n\u03b7(y) if z = x ,\n\uf8f3\n\u03b7(x) if z = y ;\n\nand \u03c3 x \u03b7 is the configuration obtained from \u03b7 by flipping the variable \u03b7(x):\n\u001a\n\u03b7(z)\nif z 6= x ,\nx\n(\u03c3 \u03b7)(z) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b7(z) if z = x .\n\n\fFLUCTUATIONS IN BOUNDARY DRIVEN EXCLUSION PROCESSES\n\n3\n\nHence, at rate \u03b1 (resp. 1 \u2212 \u03b1) a particle is created (resp. removed) at the boundary\nsite 1 if this site is vacant (resp. occupied). The same phenomenon occurs at the\nboundary x = N \u2212 1 with \u03b2 in place of \u03b1.\nThis finite state Markov process is irreducible and has therefore a unique stationN\nary measure, denoted by \u03bd\u03b1,\u03b2\n. For 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1, denote by \u03bd\u03b3N the Bernoulli product\n\u039bN\nmeasure on {0, 1}\nwith density \u03b3. If \u03b1 = \u03b2, an elementary computation shows\nthat \u03bd\u03b1N is the invariant measure and that the process is reversible with respect to\nthis stationary state. On the other hand, if \u03b1 < \u03b2, it is known since [10] that the\ninvariant state has long range correlations.\nStatic picture. For N \u2265 1, denote by \u03c0 N the measure on [0, 1] obtained by\nassigning mass N \u22121 to each particle:\nX\n\u03c0 N (\u03b7) = N \u22121\n\u03b7(x)\u03b4x/N ,\n(2.1)\nx\u2208\u039bN\n\nwhere \u03b4u is the Dirac measure on u. It has been proved in [6] that under the\nN\nstationary state \u03bd\u03b1,\u03b2\nthe empirical measure \u03c0 N converges to the unique solution of\nthe elliptic equation\n\u001a\n\u2206\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\u03c1(0) = \u03b1 , \u03c1(1) = \u03b2 .\nWe denote the solution of this equation by \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1\u0304\u03b1,\u03b2 .\n\nOnce a law of large number has been proved for the empirical measure under the\nstationary state, it is natural to consider the fluctuations around the limit. Let\nN [\u03b7(x)] .\n\u03c1N (x) = E\u03bd\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nSince E\u03bd\u03b1,\u03b2\nN [LN \u03b7(x)] = 0 for all 1 \u2264 x \u2264 N \u2212 1, an elementary computation shows\nthat \u03c1N is the solution of\n\u001a\n(\u2206N \u03c1N )(x) = 0 for 1 \u2264 x \u2264 N \u2212 1 ,\n\u03c1N (0) = \u03b1 , \u03c1N (N ) = \u03b2 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u2206N is the discrete Laplacian: (\u2206N H)(x) = N 2 {H(x+1)+H(x\u22121)\u22122H(x)}.\nIn the case of the symmetric simple exclusion process, \u03c1N (*) is just the linear\ninterpolation between \u03c1N (0) = \u03b1, \u03c1N (N ) = \u03b2.\nTo define the space in which the fluctuations take place, denote by C02 ([0, 1]) the\nspace of twice continuously differentiable functions on (0, 1) which are continuous\non [0, 1] and which vanish at the boundary. Let \u2212\u2206 be the positive operator,\nessentially self-adjoint on L2 [0, 1], defined by\n\u2212\u2206 =\nD(\u2212\u2206) =\n\nd2\n,\ndx2\nC02 ([0, 1]) .\n\u2212\n\nIts eigenvalues and \u221a\ncorresponding (normalized) eigenfunctions have the form \u03bbn =\n(n\u03c0)2 and en (u) = 2 sin(n\u03c0u) respectively, for any n \u2208 N. By the Sturm-Liouville\ntheory, {en , n \u2208 N} forms an orthonormal basis of L2 [0, 1].\nWe denote with the same symbol the closure of \u2212\u2206 in L2 [0, 1].
