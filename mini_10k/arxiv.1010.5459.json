By now, the pseudo-gap is routinely observed by experimental tools that probe A(~k, \u03c9),\nthe angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)\nor, its Fourier transform, the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).\nRecently, quite a few ARPES and STS studies [3\u201310]\nhave contributed to an emerging phenomenology of the\npseudo-gap. In this emerging picture, the pseudo-gap\nis separate from the superconducting gap, is dominant\nin the \"anti-nodal\" region in the momentum space, and\nis characterized by a \"checkerboard pattern\" of charge\norder in the real space. In particular, this checkerboard\npattern, representing an organization of the electron density with approximately four lattice constant periodicities along the a or b direction of the (nearly) tetragonal CuO2 lattice, is observed in all the samples of\ncuprates that have been found to be appropriate for STS\nstudies, i.e., Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212) compounds\n[11\u201316], Bi2\u2212y Pby Sr2\u2212z Laz CuO6+\u03b4 (Bi2201) compounds\n[17], and Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 (Na-CCOC) compounds\n[9, 18]. This unique feature, while strong in the underdoped regime, is observed up to near-optimal doping [11]\nor optimal doping [9], albeit with a diminished weight.\nWhat is the underlying mechanism of the checkerboard\npattern? Here we shall differentiate between two generic\nscenarios, a weak-correlation scenario and a strongcorrelation scenario. In the first scenario, we associate\nthe checkerboard pattern as reflecting the instability of\n\nthe electron system due to a Fermi-surface (FS) nesting. Thus, here we are envisioning the standard Peierlstype charge-density-wave (CDW) phenomenon [19] or the\nstandard weak-coupling spin-density-wave (SDW) phenomenon [20]. In the second scenario, we consider the\ncheckerboard pattern as driven by large-energy scale\nphysics, as opposed to the FS nesting physics. For instance, the checkerboard pattern has been attributed to\nan instability of the Hubbard model [21], or to the formation of a Wigner solid of hole pairs embedded in a\nsea of d-wave resonating valence bond (RVB) states [22].\nThe essential criterion by which we can distinguish the\ntwo mechanisms is the agreement between the Fermisurface nesting wave vector and the checkerboard periodicity. Within the second scenario, this agreement is\nnot a required primary feature but an optional feature.\nWithin the first scenario, this agreement is an absolute\nrequirement.\nIn our definition above, we take the weak-correlation\nFS-based scenario as the FS nesting scenario only, leaving\nout other, generally possible, one-electron-band mechanisms such as the van Hove singularity-induced CDW\n[23]. Note also that a FS object such as the \"Fermi arc\"\n[24] may give rise to a high Lindhard susceptibility due\nto the high density of states at extremal points of the arc,\ncausing a CDW. Such a Fermi-arc-based CDW scenario,\ne.g., as suggested in a recent STS work [10], requires a\nfundamental modification of the FS to a Fermi arc with\na strong correlation as a prerequisite and does not involve\nFS nesting. Thus, such a scenario should be considered\nas a strong-correlation scenario, not as a weak correlation\nscenario.\nThus, we pose the subsequent question: For hightemperature superconductors, is there a direct connection between the Fermi-surface nesting and the checker-\n\n\f2\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nAFM-ZB\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n1+x\n\n/p\n\nk y ( a)\n\nx\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\nUD18\n\nUD21\n0.5\n\nkX (p/a)\n\n10\n\nOP27\n0.5\n\nkx (p/a)\n\n10\n\nOD20\n0.5\n\nkx (p/a)\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\nkx (p/a)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Doping evolution of the Fermi energy intensity maps for (a) UD18, (b) UD21, (c) OP27, and (d) OD20\nNa-CCOC samples. The energy integration window [-10 meV, +10 meV] centered at EF was used. These maps are obtained by\nsymmetrizing the original data with respect to the (0,0)\u2013(\u03c0,\u03c0) line. The Fermi momentum values determined by the maximum\nof the MDC at EF are marked by open circles (green). The solid lines (gray) show fits to the Fermi surface of the tight-binding\nband theory [28]. In the color map, dark (black) means high intensity and pale (yellow) means low intensity. The insets of (a),\nand (d) are discussed later(\"Luttinger sum rule\").\n\nboard pattern? A survey of the literature does not give\na clear answer, which this paper now aims to provide.\nOne does find in the literature, however, some initial attempts at such an answer. For example, a recent work\non Bi2201 superconductors [17] found that the periodicity of the charge order pattern is a strong function of\nthe doping, ranging from 4.5 lattice constants in the underdoped region to 6.2 lattice constants at the optimal\ndoping. Qualitatively, this trend is what one would expect for a weak-correlation scenario, as the authors of\nthat work have indeed suggested. In addition, this conclusion appears to be supported by work on Na-CCOC\ncompounds, where a good agreement between the Fermisurface nesting vector in ARPES [25] and the checkerboard periodicity [18] has been noted. However, this\nstudy was limited to low doping values, and in view of\nmore recent work [9], a study covering a wider doping\nrange including optimal doping is necessary to attain a\nfirm conclusion.\nIn this paper, we report ARPES data on Na-CCOC\nsamples and Bi2212 samples in view of these questions.\nWe significantly widen the doping range of the Na-CCOC\nsamples studied by ARPES in comparison to previous\nstudies [25, 26], and find that such an improvement is\nof essential importance. We compare our results on NaCCOC and Bi2212 samples with their known checkerboard periodicity values. We re-examine the degree of\nagreement, or disagreement, between the Fermi-surface\nnesting and the checkerboard pattern for Na-CCOC samples, and, in addition, Bi2201 samples. We find that in all\nthe cases examined, such an agreement is absent, or accidental at best. Thus, we find that a strong-correlation\nscenario is much more likely than a weak-correlation scenario for explaining the pseudo-gap.\nThe photoemission measurements were carried out at\nbeam line 5-4 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation\n\nLightsource (SSRL) and at beam line 10.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using a Scienta R4000 electron energy analyzer. The photon energy used was 25.5 eV\nfor Na-CCOC and 25 eV for Bi2212, both with an energy resolution of 15-20 meV. The angular resolution is\n\u223c 0.2\u25e6 (0.008 \u00c5\u22121 in momentum). Na-CCOC samples,\ngrown by a high-pressure flux method to unprecedented\nhigh doping values for this experiment, include underdoped samples (Tc = 18, and21 K), optimally doped samples (Tc = 27 K), and overdoped samples (Tc = 20 K)\n[27]. Bi2212 samples were grown by the traveling solvent\nfloating-zone method, and include underdoped samples\n(Tc = 74 K), optimally doped samples (Tc = 91 K), and\noverdoped samples (Tc = 74 K). Hereafter, we will refer to the samples with the usual \"Tc notation\" such as\nUD74, OP91, and OD74, where UD, OP, and OD mean\nunder-doping, optimal doping and overdoping, respectively. All samples were cleaved in situ and measured in\nan ultra-high vacuum with a base pressure of better than\n4 \u00d7 10\u221211 mbar. For Na-CCOC samples measurements\nwere made at 10 K, while for Bi2212 samples measurements were made at 200 K for UD74 and OP91 samples,\nand at 100 K for OD74 samples. It is worth noting that\nrecent advances [9, 27] in high-pressure sample growth\nresulted in the accessibility of the optimally doped and\noverdoped samples of the Na-CCOC samples, for which\nno ARPES data have been reported previously to our\nknowledge.\nFigure 1 shows ARPES intensity maps at EF for NaCCOC samples. While these data were taken at 10 K\nin the superconducting phase, the data will be discussed\nhere only in terms of the Fermi arc [24] and the pseudogap, with the more elusive and weaker feature of the superconductivity left for a possible future study [9, 25, 29].\nThis figure clearly shows that the high-intensity re-\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\nky (\u03c0/a)\n\nIntensity(arb. units)\n\ngion of the map (\"Fermi arc\" [24]) increases its length\nas a function of doping, as expected. From our data, we\ndefine, operationally, the \"Fermi surface\" as the contour\ndetermined by the momentum distribution curve (MDC)\npeak positions (circle symbols). These Fermi surfaces in\nFigs. 1(a), and 1(b) are in good agreement with those\npublished previously on the same compounds with similar doping values [25].\nFigure 2(a) shows the energy distribution curves\n(EDCs) near the anti-nodal point, as a function of doping. It is seen that these EDCs are characterized by a\nlarge pseudo-gap, with the weight at EF strongly suppressed. This is quite reminiscent of a large pseudo-gap\nand the lack of a coherent peak, as reported by STS [9].\nFigure 2(c) shows the MDCs for a cut at the anti-nodal\npoint for the UD21 sample, and Fig 2(d) for the OP27\nsample.

In agreement with a previous work [25], the\nMDCs for the underdoped sample do not show appreciable dispersion up to a binding energy of \u223c 50 meV.\nHowever, the MDCs for the optimally doped sample show\nclear dispersions at a binding energy of >\n\u223c 30 meV. This\nis consistent with the known qualitative behavior of the\npseudo-gap as a function of doping [30].\nThe Fermi surface as defined in Fig. 1 becomes flat as\nit crosses the Brillouin zone boundary. Thus the Fermi\nsurface near the anti-nodal point is approximately nested,\nas observed previously [25], and the nesting vector can\nbe determined from our Fermi surfaces. This is shown in\nFig. 3(a), which summarizes all of our Fermi surfaces of\nFig. 1.\nFigure 3(b) summarizes our nesting wave vectors,\nalong with the wave vectors corresponding to the checkerboard patterns of STS [9, 18]. Also, included in the figure\nare the nesting wave vectors determined for underdoped\nsamples of Na-CCOC by Shen et al. [25]. First of all, it\ncan be easily noted that our data agree well with Shen\net al.'s data for the overlapping doping region. Second,\nour data, now extended to optimal doping and overdoping, clearly indicate that the nesting vector is a decreasing function of doping. Third, in hindsight, the data by\nShen et al. also show the same trend. Fourth, for the\noptimal doping, the FS nesting would imply a CDW periodicity that is too large (>\n\u223c 5.5a) as compared with the\ncheckerboard periodicity (4a).\nPreviously [25] the agreement between the ARPES\nnesting vector and the checkerboard wave vector was\ninterpreted to be very important. Given our findings\nabove, however, there emerges another possibility; The\nnesting wave vector and the checkerboard periodicity are\nindependent, although they might coincide by accident.\nThis is suggested by the striking disagreement found in\nthe doping dependence and a similarly striking disagreement in the value at optimal doping, although the second\ncan be considered as a mere consequence of the first.\nIn order to help determine which case is more likely, we\n\n\f4\n\nky (\u03c0/a)\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u0393\n\nWave vector (2\u03c0/a)\n\nUD74\n-1\n-1\n0.3\n\nWave vector (2\u03c0/a)\n\nOP91\n0\n\nOD74\n\n1 -1\n\nkx (\u03c0/a)\n\n0\n\nUD\n\nOP\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n91\n\nOP\n\nOD\n\n60\n\nTc\n\n(f)\n\nUD\n\n(e)\n\nOD\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\nUD\n\nOP OD\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTc /Tc,max\n\n80\n\n0\n\n10\n\n(g)\n\n20\n\nTc\n\nUD\n\n30 35 30\nOP\n\nOD\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTc /Tc,max\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBi2212\nSTS\nKohsaka [10]\nNa-CCOC\nMcElroy [11]\nHanaguri [9]\nHoffman [12]\nHanaguri [18]\nHowald [13]\nBi2201\nLiu [14]\nWise [17]\nVershinin [15]\nKurosawa [31]\nKurosawa [31]\n\nNa-CCOC\nK.

All data are from the literature [17, 31, 33].\nThe formats of (d) or (e) are similar to those of Fig.3(b). (f), (g) Summary of all ARPES nesting vectors (f) and STS charge\norder wave vectors (g), showing their overall contrasting behaviors.\n\nnow discuss Bi2212 superconductors and Bi2201 superconductors. Fig. 4(a)-(c) show ARPES intensity maps\nfor Bi2212 samples. Fig. 4(d) summarizes the comparison of STS data and ARPES data for Bi2212. The main\nfeature is that the Fermi-surface nesting vector for Bi2212\nis always too small in comparison with the checkerboard\n\nwave vectors. Our experimental data show the behavior\nof the anti-bonding band dispersion, while the data of\nKordyuk et al. [32], included in Fig. (d), emphasize the\nbehavior of the bonding band dispersion, consistent with\nthe well-known empirical band structure of Bi2212 [28].\nThe STS data on Bi2212 suggest that the checkerboard\n\n\f5\nperiodicity is 3.5 - 4.5 lattice constants, while the FS nesting would predict \u2248 5, or much greater, lattice constants.\nClearly, Fig. 4(d) points out the difficulty of reconciling\nthe ARPES data with the STS data in the presence of\nbilayer splitting, a point that has been already raised in\na different context [34].\nFigure 4(e) shows the comparison for Bi2201 superconductors. ARPES and STS disagree greatly here also.\nFurthermore, the disagreement becomes greater as doping decreases, i.e., as the pseudo-gap physics becomes\nmore important. A related observation is as follows:\nWhile the doping dependence of the STS data is in\nqualitative agreement with that of the ARPES data, as\npointed out previously [17], the slope of the STS data is\nactually \u2248 2.5 times too large in magnitude, as Fig. 4(e)\nshows.\nFinally, Fig. 4(f), and 4(g) present all the data of Fig.\n3(b),4(d), and 4(e) in a different way. The wave vectors are plotted as a function of normalized Tc 's. Two\nmain discrepancies between ARPES and STS are observed. First, ARPES data show a universal slope, while\nSTS data do not. Second, STS wave vectors show a narrow distribution, with most values belonging in the range\n[0.2, 0.25], while ARPES data show a wide and uniform\ndistribution.\nPutting aside this summary of discrepancies between\nARPES and STS, one might ask \"is there a way to understand the apparent complexity in the data of Bi2212 [Fig.\n4(d)]?\" The presence of bilayer splitting in the ARPES\ndata and the mixed trends of the doping dependence in\nthe STS data, the latter presumably being due to different conditions of STS experiments, contribute to this\napparent complexity. Fig. 4(f), which shows good agreement between the bonding (anti-bonding) band data for\nBi2212 with the data for Na-CCOC (Bi2201), might be\nviewed as suggesting a possible picture where the kinds\nof discrepancies observed in Na-CCOC [Fig. 3(b)] and\nBi2201 [Fig. 4(e)] have a mixed presence in Bi2212, giving rise to the observed complexity.\nTo sum up, a weak-coupling CDW (or SDW) scenario\nis highly unlikely. Instead a strong-electron correlation\nis likely the driving force of the charge order. Note that\nthis conclusion does not rule out the possibility of a cooperative or secondary effect of the FS nesting or a similar\nmomentum-space mechanism [10].\nOur claim is corroborated by more evidence. First, if\nthe FS nesting is the driving force, then it is difficult to\nexplain why the underdoping region is preferred for the\ncharge order. According to a previous study on Bi2212\n[32], the FS in the anti-nodal region becomes very flat,\nand thus more highly nesting, at overdoping. Second,\nthe FS nesting scenario would require that the checkerboard pattern reverses the contrast as the sample bias\nvoltage changes sign [35]. The STS data [9] show quite\nthe opposite: The contrast is nonreversal.\nThe consideration of the so-called \"Luttinger sum rule\"\n\n[36] provides general additional support. The sum rule\nconcerns x, the hole doping per unit cell. In a strong\ncorrelation scenario, the sum rule is satisfied only by the\ncombination of the Luttinger surface (LS) and the FS.\nWe follow the theory of Ref. [36], and take the LS to\nbe the anti-ferromagnetic zone boundary (AFM-ZB) and\nthe FS to be approximately the geometry formed by the\nFermi arc and the AFM-ZB. As indicated in the inset\nof Fig. 1(a), in this scenario, the FS accounts for only\nx. In a weak-correlation scenario, the FS is now large,\nand accounts for 1 + x, as indicated in Fig. 1(d). Assuming the strong-correlation scenario, then, we obtain\nx = 0.11, 0.16, 0.21, and 0.23, respectively from UD18\nthrough OD20. In the weak-correlation scenario, x =\n0.00, 0.06, 0.15, and 0.19. So, while the latter scenario\nmay be appropriate for optimal or over doping, it fails\ncompletely at underdoping. Our sum-rule analysis here\nagrees well with a similar analysis based on the STS data\nof Bi2212 [10], where a connection between the modified\nFS in the strong correlation scenario and charge order\nwas noted, as already discussed above, and also with a\nrecent ARPES work on Bi2212 [37].\nTo conclude, the electron correlation is of primary importance for the charge order and the pseudo-gap in\ncuprates. In electron-correlation-based scenarios, the\ncheckerboard periodicity has been shown to be doping\nindependent [21], as in Na-CCOC, or an argument based\non the domain size has been given [22] to explain the\nsmall doping dependence seen in Bi2212. In closing,\nwe note that similar strong-correlation-based charge order scenarios have been proposed recently for quasi-onedimensional cuprates [38] and La-based superconductors\n[39], motivating further work.\nG.H.G. acknowledges helpful discussions with S.
