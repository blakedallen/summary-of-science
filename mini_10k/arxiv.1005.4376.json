Representing a complex system\nas a graph means turning the elementary units of the system into nodes, while links between nodes indicate their\nmutual interactions or relations. Many complex networks\nare characterized by a broad distribution of the number\nof neighbors of a node, i.e. its degree. This is responsible of peculiar properties such as high robustness against\nrandom failures [8] and the absence of a threshold for the\nspreading of epidemics [9].\nAnother important feature of complex networks is represented by their mesoscopic structure, characterized by\nthe presence of groups of nodes, called communities or\nmodules, with a high density of links between nodes of\nthe same group and a comparatively low density of links\nbetween nodes of different groups [10\u201313]. This compartmental organization of networks is very common in\nsystems of diverse origin. It was remarked already in the\n1960's that a hierarchical modular structure is necessary\nfor the robustness and stability of complex systems, and\ngives them an evolutionary advantage [14].\nExploring network communities is important for three\nmain reasons: 1) to reveal network organization at a\ncoarse level, which may help to formulate realistic mechanisms for its genesis and evolution; 2) to better understand dynamic processes taking place on the network\n(e.g., spreading processes of epidemics and innovation),\nwhich may be considerably affected by the modular struc-\n\nture of the graph; 3) to uncover relationships between the\nnodes which are not apparent by inspecting the graph as\na whole and which can typically be attributed to the\nfunction of the system.\nTherefore it is not surprising that the last years have\nwitnessed an explosion of research on community structure in graphs. The main problem, of course, is how to\ndetect communities in the first place, and this is the essential issue tackled by most papers on the topic which\nhave appeared in the literature. A huge number of methods and techniques have been designed, but the scientific community has not yet agreed on which methods\nare most reliable and when a method should or should\nnot be adopted. This is due to the fact that the concept\nof community is ill-defined. Since the focus has been on\nmethod development, very little has been done so far to\naddress a fundamental question of this endeavor: what\ndo communities in real networks look like? This is what\nwe will try to assess in this paper.\nPrevious investigations have shown that across a wide\nrange of networks, the distribution of community sizes\nis broad, with many small communities coexisting with\nsome much larger ones [11, 15\u201318]. The tail of the distribution can be often quite well fitted by a power law.\nLeskovec et al. [19] have carried out a thorough investigation of the quality of communities in real networks,\nmeasured by the conductance score [20]. They found that\nthe lowest conductance, indicating well-defined modules,\nis attained for communities of a characteristic size of\n\u223c 100 nodes, whereas much larger communities are more\n\"mixed\" with the rest of the network. For this reason they suggest that the mesoscopic organization of\nnetworks may have a core-periphery structure, where\nthe periphery consists of small well-defined communities\n\n\f2\n\nDATA AND METHODS\n\nAs our target is to study the statistical features of communities, we need to employ data sets on large networks\ncontaining high numbers of communities of varying size.\nOur data sets contain \u223c 105 \u2212 106 nodes, with exception for protein interaction networks (PINs), where the\nlargest available data sets are of the order of 104 nodes.\nTable I lists the network datasets we have used, along\nwith some basic statistics. Most of them have been\ndownloaded from the Stanford Large Network Dataset\nCollection (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/). Some\nnetworks are originally directed (e.g., the Web graph),\nbut we have treated them as undirected. Further details\non all networks can be found in the Appendix.\nOverall, we have considered five categories of networks:\n\u2022 Communication networks. This class comprises the email network of a large European research institution, and a set of relationships between Wikipedia users communicating via their discussion pages. Note that in both cases, communication is not necessarily personal but involves, e.g.,\nmass emails, and thus these networks cannot be\nconsidered as social networks.\n\u2022 Internet. Here we have two maps of the Internet\nat the Autonomous Systems (AS) level, produced\nby the two main projects exploring the topology of\nthe Internet: CAIDA (http://www.caida.org/)\nand DIMES (http://www.netdimes.org/).\n\u2022 Information networks.\nThis class includes\na citation network of online preprints in\nwww.arxiv.org, a co-purchasing network of\nitems sold by www.amazon.com and two samples\nof the Web graph, one representing the domains\nberkeley.edu and stanford.edu (Web-BS), the\nother was released by Google (Web-G).\n\u2022 Biological networks. This class contains the\nPINs of three organisms: fruit fly (Drosophila\n\n\u2022 Social networks.\nHere we considered four\ndatasets: a network of friendship relationships between users of the on-line community LiveJournal\n(www.livejournal.com); the set of trust relationships between users of the consumer review site\nepinions.com; the friendship network of users of\nslashdot.org; the friedship network of users of\nwww.last.fm.\nThe problem of choosing a method for detecting communities is a very delicate one. First, very efficient algorithms are needed, because the networks we study are\nlarge. This requirement rules out the majority of existing methods. Second, as discussed above, there is no\ncommon agreement on an all-purpose community detection method. This is because of the absence of a shared\ndefinition of community, which is justified by the nature\nof the problem itself. Consequently, there is also arbitrariness in defining reliable testing procedures for the\nalgorithms. Nevertheless, there is a wide consensus on\nthe definition of community originally introduced in a\npaper by Condon and Karp [22]. The idea is that a network has communities if the probability that two nodes\nof the same community are connected exceeds the probability that nodes of different communities are connected.\nThis concept of community has been implemented to create classes of benchmark graphs with communities, such\nas those introduced by Girvan and Newman [10] and\nthe graphs recently designed by Lancichinetti et al. [23],\nwhich integrate the benchmark by Girvan and Newman\nwith realistic distributions of degree and community size\n\nCommunication\n-2\n\nInformation\n\nInternet\n-2\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-6\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-8\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n-8\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nBiological\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n10\n\nSocial\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nweb-BS\n\n10\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n-8\n\n10\n\nP(s)\n\nII.\n\nmelanogaster), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)\nand man (Homo sapiens).\n\nP(s)\n\nand the core comprises larger modules, which are more\ndensely connected to each other and therefore harder to\ndetect. Guimer\u00e1 and Amaral have proposed a classification of the nodes based on their roles within communities [21].\nHowever, the fundamental properties of communities\nin real networks are still mostly unknown. Uncovering such properties is the main goal of this paper. For\nthis purpose, we have performed an extensive statistical\nanalysis of the community structure of many real networks from nature, society and technology. The main\nconclusion is that communities are characterized by distinctive features, which are common for networks of the\nsame class but differ from one class to another. Remarkably, such characterization is independent of the specific\nmethod adopted to find the communities.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nModule Size s\nFigure 1: Distribution of community sizes.

Recent work indicates that some algorithms perform very well on the LFR benchmark [24].\nIn particular, the Infomap method introduced by Rosvall\nand Bergstrom [25] has an outstanding performance, and\nit is also fast and thus suitable for large networks. However, as every community detection method has its own\n\"flavor\" and preference towards labeling certain types of\nstructure as communities, relying on a single method is\nnot enough if general conclusions on community structure\nare to be presented. Therefore we have cross-checked the\nresults obtained by Infomap with those produced by a\nvery different algorithm, the Label Propagation Method\n(LPM) proposed by Leung et al. [26]. The latter has\nproven to be reliable on the LFR benchmark and is also\nfast enough to handle the largest systems of our collection. Detailed descriptions of Infomap and the LPM are\ngiven in the Appendix. Here we just point out the profound differences between the two techniques. Infomap\nis a global optimization method, which aims to optimize\na quality function expressing the code length of an infinitely long random walk taking place on the graph.\nThe LPM is a local method instead, where nodes are\nattributed to the same community where most of their\nneighbors are. The partitions obtained by both methods\nfor the same network are in general different. However,\nthe general statistical features of community structure do\nnot appear to depend much on the details of partitions.\nIn the following, only Infomap results will be presented;\nfor LPM, see Appendix.\n\naverage degree max degree\n3.89\n100,029\n2.75\n7,636\n4.03\n2,628\n5.82\n3,988\n9.87\n6,332\n25.37\n2,468\n11.89\n2,760\n19.41\n84,230\n6.05\n178\n2.36\n56\n8.70\n282\n17.68\n20,333\n10.69\n3,044\n8.49\n13,431\n12.13\n2,539\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe begin the analysis by briefly discussing the distribution of community sizes (Fig. 1).

Data points are averages within logarithmic bins of the module size s.\n\n\f4\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nINTERNET\n\nINFORMATION\n\nBIOLOGICAL\n\nSOCIAL\n\na)\n\nc)\n\ne)\n\ng)\n\ni)\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nf)\n\nh)\n\nj)\n\nFigure 3: Visualized examples of communities in networks of different classes. Communication networks (a: email, b: Wiki\nTalk) contain very sparse communities with star-like hubs. These hubs give rise to very low shortest path lengths within\ncommunities (see Fig. 4). Star-like hubs are are also present in Internet communities (c: DIMES, d: CAIDA), which are\nrelatively sparse as well. The CAIDA community displays a \"merged-star\" structure fairly typical for these networks (see\nAppendix). On the contrary, information networks contain dense communities up to large cliques (e: Amazon, f: Web-BS). In\nbiological networks, the larger the community, the less tree-like it is (g: D. melanogaster, h: H. sapiens). Finally, communities\nin social networks appear on average fairly homogeneous (i: Slashdot, j: Epinions).\n\nthe largest systems. This is in agreement with earlier\nstudies [11, 15\u201318]. The overall shapes of the distributions are similar across systems of the same class. Distributions for biological networks show the largest differences, which, however, is likely to result from noise as\nthe networks are smaller. For biological networks, analysis performed with the LPM shows slightly different, well\noverlapping distributions (see Appendix).\nNext, we turn to the topology of the communities, and\nstudy the link density of communities and its dependence\non community size. The link density of a subgraph is defined as the fraction of existing links to possible links,\n\u03c1 = 2t/ [s (s \u2212 1)], where t is the number of its internal\nlinks and s its size measured in nodes. Here, we use the\nscaled link density \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c1s = 2t/ (s \u2212 1), which also approximately amounts to the average community-internal\ndegree of nodes in the community. We have chosen this\nmeasure since it clearly points out the nature of subgraphs. For trees, there are always s \u2212 1 links, and hence\n\u03c1\u0303tree = 2. On the other hand, for full cliques \u03c1 = 1 and\nhence \u03c1\u0303clique = s.\nFig. 2 displays the average scaled link densities \u03c1\u0303\nas function of community size for different networks.\nThe dashed lines indicate the limiting cases (\u03c1\u0303tree =\n2, \u03c1\u0303clique = s). We see that the link densities in the\ncommunication and Internet networks are very close to\nthe lower limit, which means that their communities are\ntree-like and contain only few or no loops. In communication networks, the scaled link density does not depend\non community size, whereas in Internet graphs large com-\n\nmunities appear somewhat denser. Networks in these two\nclasses are the sparsest in our collection, as their very\nsmall average degree indicates that they are overall not\nmuch denser than trees (see Table I). It should be noted\nthat in general, the intuitive view on communities is that\nthey are \"dense\" compared to the rest of the network.\nHowever, as the methods applied here yield partitions,\nthe communities of a tree-like network are also necessarily tree-like. Contrary to the above, the much denser information networks reveal a different picture, where communities are fairly dense objects, with the scaled density\nincreasing with s. Especially in the Amazon network,\ncommunities with s <\n\u223c 10 are almost cliques. Social networks show yet another pattern: the scaled density of\nthe modules grows quite regularly with the size s, approximately as a power law. Communities in social networks are mostly far from the two limiting cases: they\nare denser than trees, but much sparser than cliques, with\nthe exception of small communities which appear more\ntree-like. Finally, the biological networks are characterized by two regimes: for s <\n\u223c 10, communities are very\ntree-like; for larger values of s the scaled density increases\nwith s. In Fig. 3 the characteristic communities of each\nnetwork class are illustrated.\nThe compactness of communities can be measured using the average shortest path length ` within each community. Fig. 4 displays the average values of ` as function\nof community size s. For all networks, the average shortest path lengths ` are very small, ` < 3 with the exception of social networks. Interestingly, all plots reveal the\n\n\f5\nsame basic pattern, independently of the network class.\nFor very small communities, ` grows approximately as\nthe logarithm of the community size (indicated by the\ndashed line), which is the \"small-world\" property typically observed in complex networks [27]. We call these\nmodules microcommunities. For sizes s of the order of\n10, however, the increase of ` suddenly becomes less pronounced, and several curves reach a plateau. Modules\nwith >\n\u223c 10 nodes are macrocommunities. The stabilization of the average shortest path length in macrocommunities can be attributed to the presence of nodes with\nhigh degree, i.e. hubs, which make geodesic paths on average short. We remark that, since most of our systems\nhave broad degree distributions, shortest path lengths\nare very short [28], but the sharp transition we observe\nis unexpected and appears as an entirely novel feature.\nFor communication networks, there is a plateau with\n` \u223c 2 for s > 10. As these communities are tree-like,\nthis indicates that they have a star-like structure where\nmost nodes are connected to a central hub only and thus\ntheir distance equals two. For the Internet networks,\nthe joint presence of low density and low distances also\nmeans that hubs dominate the structure \u2013 here, \"mergedstar\" structures consisting of two or more hubs sharing\nmany of their neighbors were observed (see Fig. 3d). This\nstructure guarantees an efficient communication between\nthe systems' units. On the contrary, information, social,\nand biological networks have a higher density and hence\ntheir short path lengths are due to both the density and\nthe presence of hubs. Hubs play the least dominant role\nin social networks, as the average shortest path lengths\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\n1\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\nBiological\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nSocial\n\n4\n\n10\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nweb-BS\n\n4\n\n10\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\n5\n\nModule Size s\n\nMax Internal Degree / (s-1)\n\nAverage Shortest Path l\n\n4\n\nInformation\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\n\nkeep slowly increasing also for large s.\nThe above picture is further corroborated by Fig. 5,\nwhich displays the ratio of the maximal observed\ncommunity-internal degree of nodes max(kin ) to s \u2212 1 as\na function of the community size s. This ratio equals\nunity if any node is connected to all other nodes in\nits community, and thus it quantifies the dominance of\nhubs within communities. For communication networks,\nmax(kin )/(s \u2212 1) is close to unity even for large s, in accordance with the above observations on star-like communities. For Internet, this quantity somewhat decreases\nwith s, as communities may contain multiple hubs which\ndo not connect to all other nodes. In information networks, there are some differences. In the Web graphs, the\nlargest communities contain nodes connecting (almost)\nthe entire community. As the edge density in these communities is high, there may be several such nodes \u2013 in\na clique, all nodes have degree s \u2212 1. For biological and\nsocial networks, there is a decreasing trend. Especially\nin social networks, there are few or no dominant hubs in\nlarge communities.\nLet us next take a closer look at the relationship between individual nodes and community structure. Here,\nthe most natural property to investigate is the internal\ndegree kin , indicating the number of neighbors of a node\nin its community. We measure the embeddedness of a\nnode in its community with the ratio kin /k, characterizing the extent to which the node's neighborhood belongs\nto the same community as the node itself.

Networks in the same class display similar behavior.\n\nbeddedness of nodes would be fairly large, and a substantial fraction of their neighbors should reside inside their\nrespective communities. However, Fig. 6 shows a more\nintricate pattern, where smaller values of kin /k are not\nat all rare. All of our networks are characterized by a\nsubstantial fraction of nodes which are entirely internal\nto their communities, i.e. have no links to outside their\ncommunity and thus kin /k = 1. These correspond to\nthe rightmost data points in each plot, and such nodes\ntypically amount to over 50% of all nodes. These nodes\nhave mostly a low degree (such as the degree-one nodes\nconnected to hubs in communication networks). Networks in the same class follow essentially a very similar\npattern. Communication networks and the Internet have\nvery similar-looking profiles, where the distribution has a\npeak around kin /k \u223c 0.5. Information networks, instead,\nhave a rather different profile, with an initial smooth increase reaching a plateau at about kin /k \u223c 0.4. The biological networks, despite the inevitable noise, also show\na consistent picture across datasets. They somewhat resemble the communication and Internet networks, with\nan initial rise until kin /k \u223c 0.5, followed by a slow descent for larger values. Social networks have a rather flat\ndistribution over the whole range, with little variations\nfrom one system to another. This means that there are\nmany nodes with most of their neighbors outside their\nown community. Most community detection techniques,\nincluding the ones we have adopted, tend to assign each\nnode to the community which contains the largest fraction of its neighbors. This implies that if a node has only\na few neighbors within its own community, it will have\neven fewer neighbors within other individual communities. Such nodes act as \"intermediates\" between many\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nSince the advent of the science of complex networks,\nits focus has shifted from understanding the emergence\nand importance of system-level characteristics to mesoscopic properties of networks. These are manifested in\ncommunities, i.e. densely connected subgraphs. Communities are ubiquitous in networks and typically play\nan important role in the function of a complex system\n\u2013 modules in protein-interaction networks relate to specific biological functions, and communities in social networks represent the fundamental level of organization in\na society. The dual problem of formally defining and accurately detecting communities has so far attracted the\nmost of attention, at the cost of a lack of understanding\nof the fundamental structural properties of communities.\nOur aim in this paper has been to uncover some of these\nproperties.\nOur results indicate that communities detected in networks of the same class display surprisingly similar structural characteristics. This is remarkable, as some classes\nare really broad and comprise systems of different origin (e.g. the class of information networks, which includes graphs of citation, co-purchasing and the Web).\nThe result is verified by two different community detection methods which are both partition-based but rely on\nentirely different principles. In accordance with earlier\nresults, community size distributions are broad for all\nsystems we have studied. Link densities within communities depend strongly on the network class. The average\nshortest path length displays similar behavior across all\nclasses, initially increasing logarithmically as a function\nof community size (microcommunities) and then slowing down or saturating for communities of size s >\n\u223c 10\n(macrocommunities). In combination with our results on\nlink density in communities, the behavior of path lengths\nreveals a picture where high-degree nodes are very dominant in communities of certain classes (communication,\nInternet) and play a less important role in the connectivity of others, especially social networks. This picture\nis corroborated by the analysis of maximal communityinternal degrees of nodes. Finally, also the probability\ndistribution of the fraction of internal links for nodes displays a clear signature for each of the considered classes.\nThe signatures we have found are a sort of network\nID, and could be used both to classify other systems and\nto identify new network classes. Moreover, they could\nbecome essential elements of network models, with the\nadvantage of more accurate descriptions of real networks\n\n\f7\n\nCommunication\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nInformation\n\n0\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nWeb-BS\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n-8\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n-12\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nBiological\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nSocial\n\n0\n\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n-2\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n-2\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n10\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n10\n3\n0\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n-6\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nDegree k\nFigure 7: Degree distributions.\n\nClustering Coefficient\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\n\n1.0\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n0.8\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge ICTeCollective.\nThe\nproject ICTeCollective acknowledges the financial support of the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET)\nprogramme within the Seventh Framework Programme\nfor Research of the European Commission, under FETOpen grant number: 238597.\n\n10\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n-4\n\n1.0\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n10\n\nInternet\n\n0\n\n10\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n-2\n\n10\n\np(k)\n\nand predictions of their evolution.\nAlthough our results have been obtained using two different methods, their general validity merits some discussion. As the concept of \"community\" is ill-defined, every\nmethod for detecting communities is based on a specific\ninterpretation of the concept. Furthermore, the underlying philosophies of methods can largely differ. Methods\nrequiring that communities are \"locally\" very dense, such\nas clique percolation [15], would detect only a few communities in the communication and Internet networks,\nas they do not consider trees or stars as communities\n\u2013 nevertheless, this result would be consistent for networks of the same class. On the other hand, it is evident\nthat partition-based methods neglect the fact that nodes\nmay participate in multiple communities. However, it\nis worth noting that whichever method is used, the resulting communities are actual subgraphs of the network\nunder study, i.e. its building blocks. Thus their statistical properties reflect the mesoscopic organization of networks, and our results indicate that this organization is\nsimilar within classes of networks.\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\n5\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nWeb-BS\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nInformation\n\n1.0\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nBiological\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\nSocial\n\n1.0\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n10\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\nAppendix A: Data sets: basic statistics\n\nDegree k\n\nIn Fig. 7 we show the degree distributions for all the\nnetworks. The degree distribution spans several orders\nof magnitude. In Fig. 8 the clustering coefficient [27] of\nnodes with degree k is plotted as a function of k, defined\nas the number of links between neighbors t of the node\ndivided by the maximum possible number of such links f:\nc = t/( 12 k (k \u2212 1)). As we can see, the shape of the clustering spectrum is basically the same across all networks,\nwith a rapid decrease of the clustering coefficient with k,\nexcept for the Web graphs, which are known to include\nvery dense subgraphs and cliques, for which the clustering coefficient can be appreciably high also for nodes of\ndegree \u223c 100. In Fig. 9 we report the average degree\nknn of the neighbors of nodes with degree k again as a\nfunction of k [33]. Communication networks, the Internet and the Web graphs are clearly disassortative, the\nother networks are either moderately disassortative or\ndo not exhibit a particular correlation. Only the Livejournal friendship network has an assortative pattern for\nintermediate degree-values.\n\nFigure 8: Clustering coefficient versus degree.\n\nAppendix B: The community detection methods\n\nIn this section, we briefly explain the two community detection algorithms. For a detailed description, the\nreader is referred to the original publications.\nInfomap [25] is based on the idea that a random walker\nexploring the network should get trapped inside dense\nmodules for a fairly long time, and cross the boundaries\nof modules only infrequently. This simple idea is formalized by considering the problem of finding the optimal description of the path of the walker, which can be\nachieved by labelling every node with a prefix given by\na unique name for the module it belongs to and a suffix\ngiven by a unique name within its module. The labels of\nnodes, while unique within their module, can be recycled\nin different modules to achieve the most compressed de-\n\n\f8\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n5\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n3\n\n10\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nWeb-BS\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nknn\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n10 10 10 10 10\n3\n\nBiological\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10 0 1 2 3 4 5\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nSocial\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\nIn order to verify that our results are not due to the\nmethod alone, but represent real features of the mesoscopic organization of the networks, we have carried the\nanalysis presented for Infomap in the main paper with\nthe Label Propagation method as well.

According to such two-level description, given\na partition of the graph, one can compute the amount of\ninformation needed to describe the path of the walker. If\nthe network has a well-defined community structure, the\ncode length of the two-level description may be shorter\nthan the code length of the one-level description, in which\neach node has a unique name, as the walker will perform\nmost of its steps within each module and comparatively\nfew between the modules. In this way, the recycling of\nthe labels leads to a more compact description of the\nprocess. Then the problem of Infomap is finding the partition which gives the smallest description length. This\noptimization problem is solved using a greedy optimization algorithm in order to obtain the results in reasonable\ntime. The use of random walks makes the method naturally generalizable to the case of directed and weighted\ngraphs. For directed graphs, due to the possibility of\nhaving dangling ends, which are sinks for the diffusion\nprocess, it is necessary to introduce a teleportation factor, similarly to Google's PageRank algorithm [34].\n\nP(s)\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n-4\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nLPM\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nModule Size s\nFigure 10: Distribution of community sizes.\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\n2\n\n10\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c1. s\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nSocial\n\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nBiological\n10\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nweb-BS\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\n2\n\nInformation\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\nThe Label Propagation Method [35] basically simulates\nthe spreading of labels based on the simple rule that at\neach iteration a given node takes the most frequent label\nin its neighborhood. The starting configuration is chosen\nsuch that every node is given a different label and the\nprocedure is iterated until convergence. This method has\nthe problem of partitioning the network such that there\nare very big clusters, due to the possibility of a few labels\nto propagate over large portions of the graph. The LPM\nversion that we used in our analysis is a modification by\nLeung et al. [26] that handles this problem by introducing\na hop score which tells how far a certain label is from its\norigin. The hop score is decreased while the label spreads\nthrough the network and this improves the quality of the\npartitions found by the method.\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\nSocial\n\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n-1\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nweb-BS\n\n10\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n-8\n\n3\n\n10\n\nLPM\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n6\n\nModule Size s\nFigure 11: Scaled link density of communities as a function\nof the community size.\n\n\f9\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nWiki Talk\nEmail\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nBiological\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nSocial\n\n10\n10\n\n-4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nDmela\nYeast\nHuman\n\n10\n\nLive J\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n0\n\nLPM\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nSocial\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 10\n\n10\n\nMobile\nEpinions\nLast FM\nSlashdot\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nLPM\n\n-1\n\n10\n10\n\nBiological\n10\n\n4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 10\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nWeb-BS\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-4\n\nInformation\n1\n\nAS-caida\nAS-dimes\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n10 10 10 10 10\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\n1\n\nweb-G\nArxiv\nAmazon\nweb-BS\n\np(kin/ k)\n\nAverage Shortest Path l\n\n4\n\nInformation\n\nInternet\n\nCommunication\n\n-2\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nModule Size s\n\nkin / k\n\nFigure 12: Average shortest path of a community as a function of the community size s.\n\nFigure 14: Distribution of the fraction of neighbors of a node\nbelonging to the community of the node.\n\nAppendix D: Further Statistics on Community\nProperties\n\nules: Fig. 16 shows what happens if we discard very\nsmall communities, with less than 3 nodes (s < 3), and\nFig. 17 displays what is left when we consider fairly big\nmodules, s > 10; only social and information networks\ninclude dense modules even after this filtering.\nNext, we show the average internal clustering coefficient as a function of the module size s, Fig. 18. The\nclustering coefficient c is a node property defined as the\nnumber of links between neighbors t of the node divided\nby the maximum possible number of such links for a node\nwith the same degree k: c = t/( 12 k (k \u2212 1)). For nodes\nwith degree smaller than two we consider the clustering\ncoefficient to be undefined and leave them out of the calculations of the averages. Here, \"internal\" means that\nthe clustering coefficient is computed by only considering the subgraph of the community, which includes only\nthe internal links in the community. For communication\nsystems and the Internet, the average internal clustering\ncoefficient of large communities can reach fairly high values although the corresponding densities \u03c1 are low. This\ncan be explained in terms of \"merged-star\" structures,\nwhere two (or more) high-degree nodes are connected,\ntheir neighbours have a low degree (approx. the number\nof hubs) and are connected to all hubs. As then the clustering coefficient for these nodes is typically unity and\ntheir number is large, they dominate the average clustering coefficient within the community.\n\nMax Internal Degree / (s-1)\n\nIn this section, we want to show some other statistical properties of the modules. All figures display the\nresults obtained using Infomap (upper panel) and the\nLabel Propagation Method (lower panel).\nAs in the main article only the average values of link\ndensities are shown, we first want to show what the probability distribution of the link density \u03c1 of communities\nlooks like. Fig. 15 shows that in all the systems there\nare dense modules together with sparser modules.

The two plots display flatter curves than the full distributions, and they look much smoother, indicating that\nthe fluctuations observed in the full curves are mostly due\nto low degree nodes. Low degree nodes can cause peaks\nin the plots because the values of the fraction kin /k are\nquantized (e.g. for a node of degree two the fraction\nmust be 0, 0.5 or 1). By observing the rightmost points\nof the curves, we see that they lie much lower than the\ncorresponding points of the full curves, except for the information networks.
