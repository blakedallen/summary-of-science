The device\nunder test is a microwave circulator with the output taken at the isolation\nport. Isolation results from the destructive interference between two counterpropagating modes in the ferrite bulk. This configuration is the same used in\nthe well known Pound oscillator [Pou46]. The experimentalist familiar with\nphase noise should notice the following unusual facts.\n1. The low 1/f noise of the DUT, 10\u221217 /f rad2 /Hz, measured without need\nof correlation.\n2.

The smoothness of the plot, achieved with a small number of averaged\nsamples (m = 10).\nThe background noise deserves more attention. The conversion between spectrum and Allan variance, which is a simple mathematical process, can be done\nwith to any physical quantity. The formula \u03c3 2 (\u03c4 ) = 2 ln(2) h\u22121 applies to flicker\nS(f ) = h\u22121 /f . Therefore, after converting the phase spectrum S\u03c6 = b\u22121 /f\ninto a length-fluctuation spectrum SL = h\u22121 /f , the Allan deviation is \u03c3L (\u03c4 ) =\n4.5\u00d710\u221212 m (Fig. 2). This high stability requires to re-think the mechanical\ndesign of electronics. That said, a resolution of parts in 10\u221214 m is common\nin the field of tunnel and atomic-force microscopy [Sar94]. Also the femtosecond laser owes its success to the unexpected mechanical stability of the optical\nassembly.\n\n2\n\nBridge measurements\n\nThe instrument, shown in Fig. 3, is based on the carrier suppression by sum\nof an equal and opposite signal. The null contains only the noise sidebands of\nthe DUT, which are amplified and down-converted to dc by coherent detection\n[Vit66]. The in-phase signal x(t) is proportional to the normalized-amplitude\nnoise (AM noise) \u03b1(t), the quadrature signal y(t) to the PM noise \u03c6(t) The\nfollowing ideas makes this scheme a fortunate choice.\n1. The 1/f noise of the passive components the bridge is made of is dramatically reduced by separating coarse and fine the adjustment of the null.\nThe coarse adjustment relies on by-step and fixed-value components. The\nfine adjustment, though more noisy because of the contact fluctuations,\nhas low weight.\n2. Close-in flicker results from up-conversion of the near-dc 1/f noise pumped\nby the carrier (cf. Sec. 5). Here the error amplifier sees only the fluctuation\nof the null. Power is too low for the up-conversion process.\n3. The noise floor is improved significantly by microwave amplification of the\nnoise sidebands before the mixer loss.\n\n\fE.

Microwave amplification of the noise sidebands before detecting reduces\nthe residuals of the mains because the dc electronics is highly sensitive to\nthese fields, the microwave section is not.\n5. The in-phase/quadrature detection is a fully-linear Cartesian process. The\ndc component of x(t) and y(t) can be used to control the null in closed\nloop. This is recommended when the experiment lasts more than some\nhalf an hour.\nThe bridge has been used successfully to measure the flicker of ferrites [RG02,\nRGG04, WIT98] (b\u22121 \u2248 10\u221217 rad2 /Hz, either HF/VHF and microwave carrier)\nand photodetectors [RSYM06] (b\u22121 \u2248 10\u221212 rad2 /Hz, 10 GHz modulation).\nThese measurements are out of reach for other methods, the first because of the\nextremely low noise, the second because of the low microwave power (order of\n10 \u03bcW).\nThe photodetector 1/f noise is relevant in OEOs (Sect. 6) and in opticalfiber links [FHH+ 07]. In the link, the detector noise can not be removed with\nthe two-way method. The value b\u22121 = 10\u221212 rad2 /Hz at 10 GHz sets the\nstability limit to \u03c3x ' 1.9\u00d710\u221217 s (Allan deviation). In the same condition the\nfractional-frequency stability of frequency transfer is \u03c3y ' 4.2\u00d710\u221217 /\u03c4 , not far\nfrom the performance of short-range links. This is seen using Sy = (f 2 /\u03bd02 ) S\u03c6\nand converting Sy into Allan deviation.\n\n3\n\nCorrelation measurements\n\nTwo equal instruments measure the same DUT, as shown in Fig. 4. This figure\nalso introduce the main symbols. Notice that x(t) and y(t) are not the same\nthing as in Sec. 2. We denote the Fourier transform with the uppercase of\nthe time-domain function, the complex conjugate with \u2217, and the average of m\nsamples with h im . Thanks to the Wiener-Kinchine theorem, the cross-spectrum\nis Syx = Y X \u2217 . Hence\nSyx = h[B + C] \u00d7 [A + C]\u2217 im\n= CC + O(1/m) .\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThus, Syx converges to the spectrum Sc = CC \u2217 of the DUT, with a residual\nrandom term of the order of 1/m.\n\n\f#\n\n#\n\n|Re{Syx}|\n\n!%#\n\n|Re{Syx}|\n!%#\n\n|Scc|\n\nfrequency\n!\n\n#!\n\n\"!\n\n|Re{Syx}|\n|Scc|\n\n!%#\n!%!#\n\ny\n$!!\n\n!%!!#\n\n\"!\n\n|Re{Syx}|\n|Scc|\n\n!%#\n!%!#\n\n$!!\n\n!%!!#\n\nDUT\n\n!\n\n\"!\n\na(t) instr. noise\nc(t)\n|Re{Syx}|\n!%#\n\ninput |Scc|\ninstrument B\nsignal\n\n!%!#\nFile: correlation-scheme\n\n#!!\n\n#\"!\n\nb(t)\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nNov. 30, 2008 5\n\nx=a+c\n\ny =b+c\n\ninstr. noise\n\nfrequency\n\n$!!\n\n!%!!# 4: Basic correlation measurement.\nFigure\n!\n\n#\n\nm=1024 g=0.32\n|Sxx|\n\n#\n\nm=128 g=0.32\n|Sxx| instrument A\n\n#\n\nfrequency\n!\n\n#!\n\ny\n\n#!\n\nm=64 g=0.32\n|Sxx|\n\n#\n\nfrequency\n\n!%!!#\n\n#!!\n#\"! & al.,\n$!!Phase !and frequency\n\"!\n#!! metrology.\n#\"!\n$!!\nE.

In the example, the DUT noise is 10 dB lower than the single-channel\nbackground of the instrument.\n\nIn the laboratory practice, it is often convenient to display | h<{Syx }im |\nbecause it is the minimally-biased always-positive estimator, assuming that Sc\nis real. With white noise we use the ergodicity principle to access the ensemble\n(a part of) by sweeping the frequency. Thus we have access to the average and\nto the standard deviation of | h<{Syx }im |. With small m, the single-channel\nnoise is still not rejected. This means that the term O(1/m) is larger than the\nDUT noise. In this condition, the deviation of | h<{Syx }im | is almost equal\nto the average. In logarithmic scale, the spectrum looks as a band of constant\nthickness that moves downwards on the analyzer display. Increasing m, the\nterm O(1/m) becomes lower than the DUT noise. Thus, the deviation becomes\nsmaller than the average. The track attains a constant value and shrinks. This\nis shown in Fig. 5, where for m > 32 the deviation of | h<{Syx }im | becomes\nsignificantly lower than the average.\nInterestingly, the fact that the deviation/average ratio that decreases for\nm larger than a threshold validates the measurement mathematically, without\nneed of checking on the instrument background.\nCorrelation is an old idea [HJD52, VMV64, WSGG76], which could be used\nroutinely in phase noise measurements only with the FFT analyzer [Wal92].\nThe use of correlation on a bridge instrument enables the measurement of some\ndevices that could not be measured before [RG02].

In the case of AM noise and RIN, the DUT can not be removed\nbecause the DUT is the only source of signal. Thus, the validation of the\ninstrument requires a reference of suitably low amplitude noise, which is not\navailable in general. Correlation solves the problem because the convergence\nof the spectrum to the DUT noise can be assessed mathematically through the\ndeviation/average ratio, as explained in Sec. 3. Figure 7 shows an example of\nlaser RIN measurement.\n\n\fE.

Understanding it starts from the simple observation that\n\u2022 near-dc flicker exists per se, though often made in accessible by an output\nfilter.\n\u2022 the output spectrum is white in the microwave band,\n\u2022 close-in noise appears only in the presence of a carrier.\nThe reason is that close-in noise is brought from dc to the vicinity of the carrier\nby parametric modulation, which at first approximation is linear (Fig. 8). This\nsimple model accounts for the following experimental facts about the 1/f noise\nspectra[Rub08, Chap. 2].\n\u2022 The noise is about independent of the carrier power.\n\u2022 The noise of cascaded devices is the sum of the individual spectra, regardless of the order in which the devices are chained.\n\u2022 When equal devices are connected in parallel, the noise is that of one\ndevice divided by the number of devices.\nThe typical value of the flicker parameter b\u22121 in amplifiers is of 10\u221214 rad2 /Hz\nfor bipolar RF units, of 10\u221212 rad2 /Hz for SiGe microwave units, and of 5\u00d710\u221211\nrad2 /Hz for HBT microwave units; and of 10\u221212 rad2 /Hz for high-speed photodetectors.\n\n6\n\nNoise in OEOs\n\nThe opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) is an appealing alternative for high spectral purity microwave oscillators [YM96, YDM00]. Figure 9 shows the basic\nscheme of an optical-fiber OEO and its phase noise model[Rub08, Chap. 5]. Microwave oscillation can take place at any frequency multiple of 1/\u03c4 . A bandpass\nfilter is necessary to select a single frequency. In Fig. 9 B all the signals are the\nLaplace transform of the phase fluctuation of the microwave signal or modulation.

Using amplitude and phase as the base representation, all the nonlinearity goes in the amplitude, the phase is linear. The underlying physical\nfact is that time can not be stretched1 . As a relevant consequence, phase noise\nis additive. This eliminates the difficulty inherent in the parametric nature of\nsome noise processes, like flicker. The input \u03a8(s) is the phase noise of all the\noscillator components. The output \u03a6(s) is the phase noise at the oscillator output. The amplifier gain is exactly equal to one because the amplifier repeats\nthe phase of the input. Elementary feedback theory yields to the phase-noise\ntransfer function H(s) = 1/[1 \u2212 B(s)], where B(s) represents the delay and the\nlow-pass equivalent of the mode selector. The function |H(jf )|2 is an extension\nof the Leeson model [Lee66].\nFigure 10 shows an example of transfer function |H(jf )|2 and of phase noise\nspectrum with 4 km optical fiber, i.e., with a delay of 20 \u03bcs. The peaks of\n|H(jf )|2 at n/\u03c4 (50 kHz, 100 kHz, etc.) are due to the contiguous microwaves\nmodes kept below the oscillation threshold by the mode selector. The spectrum\nis measured with two delay lines used as the frequency discriminator, taking the\naverage cross-spectrum to enhance the sensitivity [VCT+ 08]. The 1/f 3 noise is\nno more than 2 dB higher than the theoretical value, evaluated by putting the\n1/f noise of the electronics in the Leeson formula. The phase noise 10\u22123 /f 3\n(frequency flicker) is equivalent to the Allan deviation \u03c3y = 3.7\u00d710\u221212 .\n1 This\n\nmay not be true in the presence of strong non-linearity.\n\n\fE.
