We have obtained very sensitive H i observations of the face-on\ngalaxy NGC 6946 and of the nearly edge-on starburst galaxy NGC 253. We\nfind high velocity H i clouds in NGC 6946 and extra-planar gas with anomalous\nvelocities in NGC 253. In both galaxies there seems to be a close connection\nbetween the star-forming disk and the halo H i. In the outer parts of NGC 6946\nthere is also evidence for recent gas accretion.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nH i has been detected in the halos of several spiral galaxies. Studies of the edgeon galaxies NGC 891 (Swaters et al. 1997; Fraternali et al. 2003) and UGC 7321\n(Matthews & Wood 2003), and the intermediate inclination galaxy NGC 2403\n(Schaap et al. 2000; Fraternali et al. 2003) have revealed a thick layer of H i\nrotating more slowely than the underlying disk (see Oosterloo et al., this conference, for an overview of these studies). The origin of such a thick layer or halo is\nunknown. There are various possibilities. One of them is the galactic fountain\nmechanism according to which active star formation in the disk and supernovae\nare responsible for blowing the gas into the halo.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBoomsma et al.\n\nThe galaxies mentioned above are seen under suitable orientations for a study\nof the vertical H i distribution and the general kinematics. Vertical motions are\ninstead best observed in face-on galaxies.\nFor this purpose we have obtained new, deep H i observations with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) of NGC 6946, a nearby face-on spiral\ngalaxy showing moderate star formation activity.\nIn addition we have chosen NGC 253 as a case of a galaxy with an extreme\nstarburst, in order to trace the effects on the H i in such a limiting case. For\nthis galaxy we have used H i data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array\n(ATCA).\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nNGC 6946\nHoles and high velocity gas\n\nNGC 6946 is a nearby (6 Mpc) face-on spiral galaxy of type Scd. It has a moderate star formation activity similar to that of the Milky Way. The H i disk shows\na large number of holes (see Fig. 1, left panel). The holes may have originated\nfrom the explosions of many supernovae.\nBesides the large number of holes, NGC 6946 shows a significant amount of H i\n\nFigure 1. The left panel shows the total H i distribution in NGC 6946.\nThe two lines indicate the locations of the cuts corresponding to the positionvelocity diagrams on the right. The black arrow in the top right panel and\nthe white arrow in the left panel point at the position of an HI hole. The\nhorizontal lines in the position velocity diagrams show the systemic velocity\nof NGC 6946 (48 km/s).\n\nwith anomalous velocities. Kamphuis & Sancisi (1993) showed that NGC 6946\nhas a widespread high velocity gas component, but they could only reveal it by\nheavily smoothing the data.\nWith our observations we have the sensitivity to study the gas distribution and\n\n\f3\nkinematics in detail. As shown in the top right panel of Fig. 1, we are detecting\nseveral individual complexes of H i with anomalous velocities. Most of the complexes appear to have velocities lower than rotation, such as the 'beard' gas in\nNGC 2403 (Fraternali et al. 2001). But there are also velocities higher than the\nlocal disk rotational velocity, sometimes in excess of 100 km/s. The inclination\nof NGC 6946 is such that these are probably vertical motions.\nThe arrows in the left and top right panels of Fig. 1 indicate the position of\na big H i hole. Some anomalous H i is seen in this same direction on the low\nvelocity side, but it is not clear whether this gas is originating from the hole.\nThis slice shows that all the anomalous H i complexes are in the direction of the\ninner bright optical disk (R25 = 5.75\u2032 ), while at larger radii the gas disk seems\nto be more quiet. This supports the galactic fountain hypothesis according to\nwhich massive star formation and supernovae are responsible for blowing the\ngas out of the disk. To further illustrate this, we have constructed a map of\nthe anomalous H i, by integrating over velocities that differ more than a certain\namount from normal galactic rotation. The result is shown in Fig. 2. We find\nabout 1.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 of H i with velocities deviating more than \u00b150 km/s from\nthe local rotation. This is about 2% of the total H i mass of NGC 6946 ( 6 \u00d7 109\nM\u2299 ).\nClearly, nearly all the gas with velocities higher than 50 km/s is found in the\ndirection of the bright optical disk (which corresponds to the bright H\u03b1 distribution shown in the left panel of Fig. 2). This strongly suggests that star\nformation and high supernova rate are at the origin of the anomalous H i and\nthat the galactic fountain mechanism is responsible.\nHowever, Fig. 2 shows that some anomalous H i is also found at the outer\nedges of the gas disk where there is little star formation going on. For this gas,\ntherefore, it seems that a different explanation is needed.\n\nFigure 2. The left panel shows the H\u03b1 emission from NGC 6946\n(Ferguson et al. 1998). The middle and right panel show the anomalous H i\nwith velocities deviating more than \u00b150 and \u00b180 km/s from galactic rotation.\n\n\f4\n2.2.\n\nBoomsma et al.\nAccretion\n\nThe middle and right panels of Fig. 2 show a few distinct clouds in the outer\nparts of the H i disk of NGC 6946. One of them is associated with a hole in the\nouter disk (Fig 1, bottom right panel). In this case, star formation is unlikely to\nbe the cause. This is reminiscent of the H i hole and gas clouds found in M101\nby Van der Hulst & Sancisi (1988). Perhaps, as suggested for the M101 hole,\nalso here a collision with a small companion galaxy or a dense gas cloud may\nhave occurred.\nOther indications of accretion in NGC 6946 are noticable at low resolution. In\nFig. 3 the disk shows a large plume at the northwestern side of the disk. The\ngas in this plume has the same velocity as the two companions at the same side\nof NGC 6946. A follow-up observation with the WSRT centered at a position\nbetween NGC 6946 and the companions has not revealed any bridge between\nthem. Also the gas kinematics in the two dwarf galaxies seems unperturbed.\nTherefore the gas in the plume is probably not originating from these companions. Perhaps we are witnessing the accretion of a third companion. Accretion\nphenomena seem to be common in galaxies (Van der Hulst & Sancisi, paper at\nthis symposium). An example is the Sagittarius Dwarf in the Milky Way (Ibata\n1999).\n\nFigure 3. The H i ditribution in NGC 6946 and its companions at a resolution of 13\u2032\u2032 (grayscale) and 60\u2032\u2032 (contours). Contours are at 1.3, 2.6, 5.2,\n10.4, and 20.8\u00d71019 cm\u22122 .\n\n\f5\n3.\n\nNGC 253\n\nNGC 253 is a barred Sc galaxy in the Sculptor group of galaxies, at a distance\nof 3.9 Mpc. It is one of best nearby examples of a nuclear starburst galaxy.\nThe high star formation rate in the inner parts of the disk makes NGC 253 an\ninteresting case for the study of the galactic fountain phenomenon. The massive\nstar formation and the related high supernova rate should blow a significant\namount of gas out of the disk.\nOur new, deep H i observations of NGC 253 (Boomsma et al. 2005) show that\n\nFigure 4.\nLeft panel: Total H i map of NGC 253 on top of a DSS image.\nContours are at 0.18, 0.36, 0.72, 1.4, 2.9, 5.8, 12 and 23\u00d71020 cm\u22122 . Right\npanel: H i position-velocity map of NGC 253 after strip-integrating in the\ndirection parallel to the minor axis. The halo emission is visible at the northeast side of the galaxy, near the systemic velocity. Contours are at -4, -2, -1,\n-.5 -.25 -.125, .125, .25, .5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 Jy/beam.\n\nthere is indeed H i above the disk of this starburst galaxy. The total H i distribution (Fig. 4, left panel) shows plumes of H i extending 8\u2032 to 11\u2032 (9 to 12\nkpc in projection) from the midplane. The plumes straddle the extra-planar\nX-ray emission (Pietsch et al. 2000; Strickland et al. 2002), and the diffuse H\u03b1\nemission (Strickland et al. 2002).\nThe plumes are part of a larger complex of anomalous H i. This gas shows up\nclearly in the right panel of Fig. 4 as faint emission around the systemic velocity. This position-velocity diagram showing the overall kinematics of H i in\nNGC 253 has been obtained by strip-integrating in the direction parallel to the\nminor axis. The anomalous halo gas is seen only at the northeastern side of the\ngalaxy.\nWe have separated the anomalous H i from the normal, rotating H i disk and\nfound that it amounts to 8 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 of gas. This is about 3% of the total H i\nmass of NGC 253 (2.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 ).\nTo investigate the characteristics of the anomalous gas, we have constructed\nmodels of the 3-D structure and kinematics of NGC 253 consisting of a thin\nH i disk and a thick disk with different kinematics. From this we conclude that\nNGC 253 has a thick disk with a large, central cavity. This disk is only partly\nfilled with H i, mostly in the NE, and rotates more slowly than the thin disk.\n\n\f6\n\nBoomsma et al.\n\nThe H i plumes seen above and below the disk may be filaments or wall-like\nextensions of the ring to higher distances from the plane, brought up by the\ncentral superwind.\nIt is likely that, as already suggested for the X-ray and H\u03b1, the origin of the\nextra-planar H i is also related to the central starburst and to the active star\nformation in the central disk. Alternatively, we may be seeing the effects of a\nminor merger and gas accretion.\n\n4.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nNGC 6946 and NGC 253 clearly are two more examples of galaxies with extraplanar H i. Yet no consistent picture emerges and a number of processes may be\nat work. In both cases the data suggest a connection with the star formation in\nthe disk. In NGC 6946 this is more moderate but present over the entire disk.\nIn NGC 253 this is more violent, especially in the inner region. It is not clear\nwhy the amount of gas in the halo are so different in the two galaxies. In the\nouter parts of NGC 6946 we also find evidence for gas accretion.\nAcknowledgments.
