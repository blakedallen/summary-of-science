Introduction\nModern semiconductor technology has allowed to fabricate and manipulate electrons\nconfined within regions of nanometer size having a plethora of shapes. The possibility\nof tunning the shape, size and number of bound electrons of those nanostructures has\nraised a great deal of interest on the subject of the confined low-dimensional few-electron\nsystems known as quantum dots (QDs) [1, 2] either for specific applications or exploring\nnew fundamental phenomena at a quantum level [3, 4, 5].\nQuantum dots have been also termed \"artificial atoms\" because their electronic\nstructure and properties resemble those of natural atoms [6]. Electrons in quantum\ndots are confined due to potential barriers, in much the same way as electrons in\natoms are confined due to Coulomb nuclear attraction. Further similarities arise\nbecause electrons within quantum dots interact with each other through Coulomb\nforces, their energy spectra present both discrete and continuum states giving rise to\nbinding and dissociation processes, while transitions between them give rise to emission\nand absorption of radiation. Thus it is justified, to some extent, to apply \u2013mutatis\nmutandis\u2013 methods of atomic or molecular physics to the study of these systems of\nelectrons acted upon by a given confining potential. A spherically symmetric confining\npotential can provide a model for semiconductor spherical nanocrystals embbeded within\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n2\n\nan insulator [7]. In the literature dealing with calculations of electronic structure and\nproperties of QDs, a confining harmonic potential model is the most ubiquitous one.\nThis can be justified on the basis of a generalized Kohn's theorem [8] satisfied by such\na potential and, approximately, verified by experiments. A potential of this type allows\nto explain the electronic shell structure observed, e.g., in small clusters. Nevertheless,\nthe infinite height and range of a parabolic potential is clearly unphysical and allows to\naccomodate an infinite number of bound electrons, what precludes the consideration of\nbinding and dissociation processes. Other finite-range models have been also advocated;\ne.g., the energy spectra of two- and three-electron systems in a spherical potential\nwell of finite depth was obtained variationally [9], and the unrestricted Hartree-Fock\n(UHF) method was applied to the same model for the calculation of the electronic\nstructure of systems having up to 20 electrons [10]. More recently, the UHF calculation\nof ground state, chemical potential and charging energies of electrons in an infinite\nspherical potential well, with and without magnetic field, was reported [11]. However,\nthe sharp discontinuity at the QD radius for such a potential well is not completely\nsatisfactory from neither a physical nor a computational point of view, and some\ninterpolating potentials [12] as well as smoothly varying potentials have been proposed\n[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Among them, the Gaussian potential has received some attention\nand its one- [18, 19, 20, 21] and two-electron spectra [14, 15, 16] have been calculated.\nFurthermore, this potential is particularly suitable for an atomic-like treatment such as\nUHF calculations. The Hartree-Fock method is one of the most widely used methods for\nthe calculation of electronic structure of atoms and molecules. Its usual implementation\nconsists in the expansion of the unknown orbitals as a linear combination in a given\nbasis set. The method thus determine self-consistently the energy eigenvalues and the\norbitals. In atomic problems, the most common basis sets are spherical or Cartesian\nGaussian functions because they provide closed expressions for the matrix elements\nof the atomic Hamiltonian. Such an advantage holds even more when the confining\npotential is Gaussian itself. Hence, we take in this work an atomic-like approach for the\ncalculation of the electronic structure of few-electron Gaussian quantum dots. Such an\napproach shall be particularly advantageous when dealing with, e.g., systems of coupled\nquantum dots, and also for the analisys of mixed systems, like molecules coupled to\nQDs. Work along that line will be published elsewhere. On the other hand, such a\nmethodology is the starting point for a systematic improvement in the treatment of\ncorrelation effects by, e.g. higher-order perturbation theory or multi-reference methods\n[22, 23].\n2. Theory\nWe consider a system of few electrons confined by a potential assumed in the form of a\nspherically symmetric Gaussian potential well of a typical radius R and finite depth \u2212V0 ,\ni.e., V (r) = \u2212V0 exp (\u2212r 2 /2R2 ). It approaches a parabolic behavior around its minimum\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n3\n\nwhile goes smoothly to zero at infinity. In Ref [14] the parabolic approximation\nV (r) = \u2212V0 e\u2212r\n\n2 /2R2\n\n\u2243 \u2212V0 + V0\n\n1\nr2\n= \u2212V0 + m\u03c9 2 r 2 ,\n2\n2R\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwas considered for comparison, where\n2\u03bbV0\nV0\n=\n,\n(2)\n\u03c92 =\n2\nmR\nm\nrelates the frequency \u03c9 of the harmonic oscillator corresponding to the Gaussian\nexponent \u03bb \u2261 1/2R2 . The Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a system of N electrons confined\nwithin the Gaussian well and interacting through Coulomb potentials is\n\"\n#\nX\n~2 X 2 X\ne2\n\u2212 \u2217\n\u03c8 = E\u03c8,\n(3)\n\u2207i +\nV (ri ) +\n2m i\n4\u03c0\u03ba\u01eb\nr\n0\nij\ni\ni<j\nwhere m\u2217 is the effective electron masses, and \u03ba is the medium dielectric constant\n\u03ba = \u01eb/\u01eb0 . By introducing donor Bohr radius aD = (\u03bam/m\u2217 )aB as the unit of length and\ndonor Rydberg RD = (m\u2217 /m\u03ba2 ) Ry as the unit of energy, Eq. (3) becomes\n#\n\"\nX\nX\nX 2\n2\n\u03c8 = \u03b5\u03c8,\n(4)\n\u2212\n\u2207i +\nV (ri ) +\nr\ni\ni\ni<j ij\n\nsuch that the results can be easily transferred between different materials by properly\nchanging aD and RD ; for instance, for a GaAs semiconductor QD, one has aD = 6 meV\nand RD = 10 nm.\n\nThe existence of bound states of Eq. (4) depends on the radius and depth of the\nGaussian potential. If both magnitudes are small enough, even a single electron cannot\nform a stable bound state. Some physical insight on the stability of one- and few-electron\nQDs can be gained from a simple variational estimate. The discussion will also prove to\nprovide a useful starting point for the systematic construction of basis sets used in the\n(N )\nmore complicated many-electron calculations reported below. Let E0 be the ground\nstate energy of a N-electron QD. Let us estimate variationally the ground state energy\nof one electron in a Gaussian potential. Taking into account that, around its center,\nthe Gaussian potential resembles a parabolic one, we propose a a normalized s-type\nGaussian trial function of exponent \u03b1\n\u03c6s (r) = (2\u03b1/\u03c0)3/4 exp(\u2212\u03b1r 2 ).\n\n(5)\n\nThe deeper the well, the more similar its ground state is to that of the harmonic\noscillator. The expectation value of the one-electron Hamiltonian then becomes\n\u00133/2\n\u0012\n2\u03b1\n,\n(6)\nE(\u03b1) = 3\u03b1 \u2212 V0\n\u03bb + 2\u03b1\nwhere the first and second terms are the mean values of the kinetic energy and the\nconfining potential, respectively. Minimization with respect to \u03b1, i.e. \u2202E(\u03b1)/\u2202\u03b1 = 0,\ngives\n(\u03bb + 2\u03b1)5 \u2212 8\u03bb2 V02 \u03b1 = 0,\n\n(7)\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n4\n\nwhich has to be solved numerically for given \u03bb and V0 . Eq. (7) has five roots but,\ntypically, the one that minimizes E(\u03b1), is a positive number of the order of unit \u03b1 = \u03b1opt .\nThe other roots can be rejected on a physical basis because whether they are complex\nconjugate pairs, or real but negative or very close to zero and, hence, the corresponding\ntrial functions do not describe bound states. Thus, within this variational approach,\nthe energy of a single-electron QD is\n(1)\n\nE0 = E(\u03b1opt ).\n\n(8)\n\nOn the other hand, the ground state of a two-electron QD corresponds to one electron\nwith spin + 21 and the other with spin \u2212 12 and interacting with each other through the\nCoulomb interaction Vee = 2/r12 . Therefore,\n(1)\n\nE (2) = 2E0 + J,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere J is the energy shift of the one-electron levels due to the Coulomb interaction\nbetween two Gaussian charge densities\nr\nZ\n\u03b1opt\n2 1\n2 3\n3\nJ = 2 |\u03c6s (r1 )|\n|\u03c6s (r2 )| d r1 d r2 = 4\n.\n(10)\nr12\n\u03c0\n\nThe condition of stability of the two-electron QD discussed in Refs. [9, 10] and applied\n(2)\n(1)\nin Refs. [14, 16], E0 < E0 , is equivalent to\n(1)\n\nE0 < \u2212J.\n\n(11)\n\nWe shall discuss thoroughly the conditions for stability below when considering the results for few-electron QDs.\nIn the calculations reported in this work we have considered both one- and\nfew-electron systems. The former were used for benchmark purposes and provide\na systematic way for calibrating the method. A one-electron Gaussian potential of\nV0 = 400RD and \u03bb = 1 has been considered by various authors for the comparison\nof the methods proposed in the literature. We also address such a case as our first\ncalculation to assess the accuracy of our methodology. The first issue to be considered\n(i)\nis the choice of a suitable Cartesian Gaussian basis set {\u03c6l }, (i = 1, . . . , K), where\n(i)\n\n\u03c6l = xm y n z p exp(\u2212\u03b1i r 2 ),\n\n(12)\n\nand l = m + n + p is the angular momentum of the function. Hereafter we use the\nspectroscopic notation s, p, d, . . . for l = 0, 1, 2, . . ., thus\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n{\u03c6l } = {\u03c6s(i) , \u03c6p(i)x , \u03c6(i)\npy , \u03c6pz , \u03c6dxx , \u03c6dxy , . . .}.\n\n(13)\n\nThe one-electron QDs were solved by direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian,\nwhile the many-electron systems were treated with the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF)\nmethod. The calculations for a given potential, i.e., for a given pair (V0 ,\u03bb), were performed with the same basis sets, irrespective of the number of electrons.\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n5\n\nTable 1. Values of the parameters \u03bb and V0 for the\n\u221a Gaussian potentials studied.\nThe radii of the quantum dots are given by R = 1/ 2\u03bb. \u03b1opt are the variationally\noptimized exponents used to construct the basis sets.\n\n\u03bb (a.u.\u2217 )\n1.0\n0.5\n0.5\n\nV0 (RD ) R (aD )\n400\n0.707\n50\n1.0\n15\n1.0\n\n\u03b1opt (a\u22122\nD )\n9.370 885\n2.183 148\n1.047 992\n\nThe prescription for the choice of the basis is based on the previously discussed\nvariational energy expression [Eq. (6)], and the optimal exponent \u03b1opt [Eq. (7)].\nThe values of \u03b1opt for the three cases considered in this paper are listed in Table\n1. Those exponents were then used to generate the basis functions with higher angular\nmomentum, i.e., we choose \u03b1s = \u03b1p = \u03b1d = . . . = \u03b1opt . This procedure can be justified\nas long as the Gaussian potential is similar to the parabolic potential, whose solutions are\nHermite polynomials multiplied by Gaussian functions with an exponent independent\nof the principal and angular quantum numbers n and l, thus exactly satisfying the\nprescription given above. By including one Gaussian function with the optimized\nexponent in each angular momentum block up to a maximum value L, i.e. 0 \u2264 l \u2264 L,\nthe low-lying states are reasonably well reproduced as compared to previously reported\nvalues. In particular, the ground state energy is correct within 10\u22122 RD approximately,\nas expected, because of the variational procedure for obtaining the basis exponents.\nGenerally, states having l > L are missing or, if obtained, have the larger errors.\nThis is also a consequence of the fact that the low-lying states of the parabolic and\nGaussian potentials are alike, but those of high angular momentum are not. Hence, to\nget a correct description of high-lying excited states, functions with the corresponding\nangular momentum l have to be included. In atomic and molecular calculations, a useful\nprocedure for enlarging the basis set has been the so-called even-tempered criterion [24]\nby which a basis set having various functions of the same angular momentum has their\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nexponent in the same ratio, i.e., for a given l, the exponents \u03b1l , \u03b1l , \u03b1l , . . . are in\n(i+1)\n(i)\nthe ratio \u03b1l /\u03b1l = const. In the limit of a large number of functions the basis\nset should become complete, independently of the ratio chosen. We take arbitrarily a\nratio of 2 to enlarge every block of angular momentum in the original basis set, thus\n(i)\nincluding exponents \u03b1l = \u03b1opt /2i\u22121 (i = 1, . . . , K) smaller than the optimized one. A\nvalue of K = 4 has been enough to reach converged energies within 10\u22123 RD for all the\ncalculations reported here.

Results and discussion\n3.1. One-electron quantum dots\nIn Table 2 we have listed the energy eigenvalues calculated for the potentials studied.\nThe first one, V0 = 400, has been studied previously [18, 19, 20, 21] and provides\na measure of the precision of our calculations. The first column refers to energies\ncalculated by diagonalizing the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian after expansion\nin the basis set described above. The second column corresponds to a numerical solution\nof the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by using the Numerov's integration algorithm [25], that we\nhave implemented as an independent verification for the basis set expansion method.\nFor the first potential, where results from a number of methods are available, the third\ncolumn referes to Ref. [19], which has probably the most accurate results reported so far.\nThis potential has bound states with angular momenta as high as l = 7, what makes it\ndifficult to reproduce with a basis set having functions with l = 0 through l = 4. This is\nparticularly apparent for the energies E2f and E2g , having the largest errors. This effect\nof the incompleteness of the basis set, can be removed by adding four extra functions\nfor each l value and symmetry with 5 \u2264 l \u2264 7, what amounts a total of 360 basis\nfunctions. The energies calculated with this enlarged basis become E2f = \u2212170.639RD\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n7\n\nand E2g = \u2212140.133RD , in good agreement with Ref. [19]. Nevertheless, the need of\nsuch a more demanding calculation should be evaluated taking into account whether\nthose states are to be occupied or because there is a perturbation exciting the electrons\nfrom low-lying states to them.\nThe case V0 = 50RD shows a good agreement between the direct diagonalization\nand numerical integration, implying that both the methodology and the basis set used\nare accurate enough. The scheme of levels obtained are in agreement with Ref. [14].\nThe system V0 = 15RD has not been treated previously and it provides a system having\njust a few bound states, in which the parabolic approximation could be poor.\nIt also can bepseen from Table 2 that the energy of the corresponding parabolic\n2\u03bbV0 /m = 5.48, 10, and 40 RD , for V0 = 15, 50 and 400 RD\npotential, ~\u03c9 =\nrespectively, represent approximately, the energy difference between the ground and\nfirst-excited state. If the potential were really parabolic, that energy difference would\nbe the same for every pair of consecutive states. That is not the case for the Gaussian\npotential, i.e., the higher the pair of states considered lie, the worse the approximation\nbecomes, as already noted by other authors [14, 16]. The basis sets optimized for these\none-electron calculations were hereafter used for the few-electrons systems.\n3.2. Few-electron quantum dots\nThe results of Hartree-Fock calculations of the ground state energy of N-electron systems\n(N = 1, . . . , 10), as a function of the QD radius, for V0 = 15RD (left panel) and\nV0 = 50RD (right panel), are shown in Fig. 1. This figure has features alike the one\nobtained with a finite depth square well [10]. For comparison purposes, the variational\n(1)\n(2)\none- and two-electron energies E0 [Eq. (6)] and E0 [Eq. (9)] were also plotted (dashed\nlines).\n(N )\n(N )\nThe figure shows several critical radii Rc at which a crossover between the E0\n(N \u22121)\n(N )\nand E0\nground states occurs. Thus, Rc is the minimum radius to have N bound\n(N )\nelectrons; for R > Rc , the N-electron QD becomes more stable than the (N \u2212 1)electron one. It should be noted that at small enough radii no bound state exists. At\n(2)\n(2)\nradii less than Rc = 0.43aD (for V0 = 15RD ) and Rc = 0.23aD (for R = 50RD ) only\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\na single electron can be bound, but for R > Rc , E0 < E0 . The radii for N = 1 and\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(8)\nN = 2 are quite similar (Rc \u2243 Rc ). So also happens for Rc \u2243 Rc . . . \u2243 Rc and\n(9)\n(10)\nRc \u2243 Rc .\nMost of the general features of the stability of the N-electron system can be\nunderstood considering the one-electron energies. An electron confined within a well\nof a typical size R will have a momentum of order ~/R due to the uncertainty principle;\nits kinetic energy then becomes of order ~2 /2mR2 , which approaches zero as R goes\nto infinity. On the other hand, its potential energy \u2212V0 exp(\u2212r 2 /2R2 ) approaches the\nbottom of the well \u2212V0 . Then, in the limit of large radius, the energy of the one-electron\nsystem goes to \u2212V0 and, since also the Coulomb interaction goes to zero, the energy of\nthe N-electron well approaches \u2212NV0 . Such a trend can be observed in Fig. 1.\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n8\n\n(N )\n\nAt a given finite radius, however, the energies E0 are not equally spaced for\nsuccessive N, because of the shell structure of the energy levels of the potential well.\nThis shell structure is even more strikingly revealed in the left panel of Figure 2, where\nthe chemical potential \u03bc(N) is depicted as a function of the QD radius. The chemical\npotential represents the affinity of the well for binding an extra electron. It is the\nequivalent of the ionization potential or the electron affinity in atomic physics. It\nis clearly apparent a grouping of the lines corresponding to the number of electrons\noccupying the same one-electron level. All curves decreases as R increases due to the\nfact that when the electrons becomes less confined, the system approaches a classical\nbehavior and it is easier to add a new electron. In the right panel of Figure 2, the\ncharging energy, defined as the difference between the chemical potential of two systems\n(N )\ndiffering in one electron, i.e. Echar = \u03bc(N + 1) \u2212 \u03bc(N), is depicted as a function of\nthe number of electrons in the QD for three potential radii, namely, 0.8, 1.5 and 2 aD .\nThe charging energy gives a measure of the stability of the system, the larger Echar , the\nmore stable the system. For N = 2, 5 and 8 electrons, the system presents large values\nof Echar , in correspondence with the number of electrons needed for filling or half-filling\na shell. The peaks heights also diminishes as the QD radius increases. That is, the\ncharging energy as a function of N, tends to be flat because of the disappearance of the\nshell structure in this classical limit.\nAs an illustration of the relation between the QD depth and the critical radius,\nwe have depicted, in Figure 4, the curves V0 versus 1/Rc2 for a QD of three interacting\n(upper curve) and non interacting electrons (lower curve). They are the locus of the\npoints representing the minimum QD radii for a given depth. Both curves are nearly\nstraight lines, thus showing that V0 Rc2 is approximately constant. We shall show, in the\nfollowing, that the variational energy of the one-electron Gaussian potential also has\nsuch a property. By defining the dimensionless variable x = 2\u03b1/\u03bb, the energy E0 (\u03b1)\n[Eq. (6)] can be written as\n\"\n\u00133/2 #\n\u0012\nx\n3\n= \u03bb\u03b5(C),\n(14)\nE(\u03b1) = \u03bb x \u2212 2C\n2\nx+1\nwhere C = V0 R2 and \u03b5 is the dimensionless energy depending on C. On the other hand,\nthe equation determining the optimal variational exponent can be written as\n\u2202\u03b5\n3\nx1/2\n= \u2212 3C\n= 0.\n\u2202x\n2\n(x + 1)5/2\n\n(15)\n\nThe equation \u03b5(C) = 0 represents the condition to have at least one bound state, which\nclearly only depends on V0 R2 . This equation and (15) are simultaneously satisfied if\n\u221a\ngiven\nx = 1/2 and C = 9 3/8, i.e., \u03b1 = \u03bb/4 = 1/8R2 and V0 R2 = 1.95.\np Hence, for a \u221a\n(1)\nV0 , the minimal radius for having one bound electron is Rc = 1.95/V0 = 1.40/ V0 .\nThis can be compared to the results we would obtain with the truncated parabolic\napproximation of the Gaussian potential, i.e., V (r) = \u2212V0 + m\u03c9 2 r 2 /2 if r < R, and zero\notherwise, with \u03c9 given by Eq. (2). In such a case, the condition for having at least one\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n9\n\nbound state is that the zero point energy becomes less or equal than zero. That is, at\nthe critical radius,\nr\n3\nV0\n3\n(1)\n= 0,\n(16)\nE0 = \u2212V0 + ~\u03c9 = \u2212V0 + ~\n2\n2\nmR2\n\u221a\n(1)\nthus giving V0 Rc2 = 9/4 = 2.25, i.e., Rc = 1.5/ V0 , comparable to the relation obtained above. If there were no interactions between the electrons, the energy for allocating the second electron would be the same, because both of them would occupy the\none-electron ground state, although with opposite spins. The Coulomb interaction between the electron pair, however, modifies such an energy by an amount J. Nevertheless,\nJ is, for small- and medium-size QDs, much smaller than the energy difference between\n(2)\nthe ground and first excited one-electron states. Thus, the next critical radius Rc is\n(1)\n(3)\nnear to the first one Rc . On the other hand, the radius Rc includes the effects of both\nthe electron-electron interaction and the shell structure because the third electron has\nto occupy the first excited one-electron level. We can estimate this radius by using an\nargument similar to the one above. The first excited state of the harmonic oscillator is\nnow (5/2)~\u03c9 above the bottom of the well, thus giving V0 Rc2 = 25/4 = 6.25. A fit of\nthe plot of Figure 4 of the form V0 = a + bRc\u03b3 gives V0 = 6.30Rc\u22122 for the non interacting\ncase, which compares fairly well to the estimation from the truncated harmonic oscillator, thus showing that the non-interacting picture is qualitatively correct. Nevertheless,\nthe corresponding fit of the UHF calculations gives a relation V0 = 7.4 + 9.0R\u22121.88 as a\nconsequence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions.\nFurthermore, the fact that V0 R2 determines the number of bound electrons is a\nproperty shared by a wealth of types of potentials. Let H be a Hamiltonian of the form\nH = \u2212\u22072 \u2212 V0 u (\u03c1)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the potential can be factored as a product of a typical energy \u2212V0 times a function\nu(\u03c1) of the dimensionless variable \u03c1 = r/R. That includes most of the types of confining\npotential used in previous works, e.g., the\npsquare well V (r) = \u2212V0 \u03b8(1 \u2212\u03c1), the parabolic\n2\npotential V (r) = ~\u03c9(r/R) with R = ~/2m\u03c9 and, clearly, the Gaussian potential.\nExpressing the Laplacian in terms of \u03c1, we get\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(18)\nH = 2 \u2212\u22072\u03c1 \u2212 V0 R2 u(\u03c1) ,\nR\nwhich has energy eigenvalues \u03b5n (V0 , R) = \u01ebn (V0 R2 )/R2 . Neglecting the electron-electron\ninteraction, the condition of stability for a N-electron system is just \u03b5n < 0, where n\nis the quantum number corresponding to the highest occupied state. It is fulfilled for\ncertain values of V0 Rc2 = Ci , giving rise to stability regions.\nTherefore, when the electron-electron interaction Vee can be neglected, the plot of\nV0 versus 1/Rc2 represents a phase diagram constituted by regions delimited by straight\nlines delimiting the various zones where N electrons can form a bound state. The argument does not hold when Vee is not negligible, since it scales with R differently to the\n\n\fFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\n10\n\nTable 3.

The spin projections of the orbital are represented by \u2191 and \u2193, for\n+1/2 and -1/2, respectively. Spin indices are omitted for closed shell configurations.\nHund Rule is fulfilled for all the configurations shown.\n\nN\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nMS Electronic Configuration\n1/2\n1s\u2191\n0\n1s2\n1/2\n1s2 1p\u2191\n1\n1s2 1p2\u2191\n3/2\n1s2 1p3\u2191\n3/2\n1s2 1p3\u2191 1p1\u2193\n1/2\n1s2 1p3\u2191 1p2\u2193\n0\n1s2 1p6\n1/2\n1s2 1p6 2s\u2191\n0\n1s2 1p6 2s2\n\nkinetic energy term.\nIt is interesting to analyze how the electrons occupy the UHF spin-orbitals as they\nare added into the system. Table 3 shows the most stable UHF configurations, for given\n(10)\nN, along with the total spin projection MS , for V0 = 50RD and R \u2265 Rc . In all the\ncalculations performed, with N \u2264 10, Hund rule is fulfilled, i.e., electrons in the same\nshell maximize the projection of the total electronic spin, in agreement with previous\nworks. As an example, we consider the UHF levels of a V0 = 15RD well of R = 1aD .\nFigure 3 shows how the scheme of levels changes as the first three electrons are added\nto it. Panel (b) shows the one-electron levels of the potential with a single electron\noccupying the ground state 1s. When a second electron is added to the system, the\npair can form a state with total spin projection MS = 1 [panel (a)] or MS = 0 [panel\n(c)]. Panels (a) and (d) shows the states available for spins + 21 and \u2212 21 drawn adjacent\nto each other. The electron-electron repulsion shifts and splits the one-electron levels\nthrough the Coulomb and exchange interactions. In the MS = 0 configuration, both\nelectrons can occupy the same orbital, while the MS = 1 configuration requires the\nsecond electron to occupy the higher p\u2191 orbital, thus giving a higher total energy. The\neffect of adding a third electron to the MS = 0 configuration, is shown in panel (d). The\n1s orbital shifts upwards and splits into 1s\u2191 and 1s\u2193 , while the 1p\u2191 becomes stabilized.\n4. Conclusions\nIn summary, we have calculated the electronic structure of electrons confined in a\nGaussian QD by using the UHF method in its Pople and Nesbet's form. We gave a\n\n\f11\n\nFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n(N )\n\nFigure 1.

The orbital energies provide\nan insight of the occupancy of the levels and show the fulfillment of Hund rule in\nagreement with previous results obtained with other models [10, 11].\nSince the Gaussian potential has a finite depth, binding and dissociation processes\ncan occur. The criterion for the stability of a N-electron system was already discussed in\n(N )\n(N \u22121)\n(N )\n(N \u22121)\nRef. [9] in terms of its energy E0 as compared to E0\n. The condition E0 < E0\nis equivalent, in UHF calculations, to the condition that the highest-occupied molecular\norbital (HOMO) is bound, i.e., \u03b5HOMO < 0, as a consequence of the Koopman's theorem\n[23]. If the electron-electron interaction can be neglected, the regions of the (V0 , R)\nplane, having N bound electrons, are delimited by the relation V0 R2 = const. This\nfeature has been proven to be a widely valid property, as a consequence of the scaling\nproperties of the confining potential.\n\n2\n\n\f12\n\nFew-electron semiconductor quantum dots with Gaussian confinement\n\nFigure 2.

It is also amenable for considering\ncorrelation effects with standard atomic methods.
