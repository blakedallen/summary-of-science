INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge amplitude collective motions (LACM), such as fissions, shape transitions, anharmonic vibrations and\nlow energy heavy ion reactions, are often encountered in the studies of nuclear structures and reactions. To go\nbeyond the phenomenological models assuming some macroscopic or collective degrees of freedom motivated\nby the experimental facts and intuitions, many attempts have been made to construct theories that are able\nto describe the LACM on a microscopic basis of the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian. Especially, theories\nbased on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approximation have been investigated extensively [1\u201316].\nThe TDHF is a general framework for describing low energy nuclear dynamics accompanying evolution of the\nnuclear selfconsistent mean-field [17,18]. A LACM corresponds to a specific solution of the TDHF equation of\nmotion. Since such a solution forms only a subset of the whole TDHF states (Slater determinants), it is often\ncalled a collective path, a collective subspace, or a collective submanifold. The collective coordinates are then\na set of small number of variables that parameterize the collective subspace, and the collective Hamiltonian\nis a function governing the time evolution of the collective coordinates. One of the main purposes of the\nLACM theories is to provide a scheme to determine the collective subspace and the collective Hamiltonian on\nthe basis of microscopic many-body Hamiltonian. Although the studies of LACM theories are the vast field\nof research with many recent developments to different directions, realistic applications to nuclear structure\nproblems are rather limited. In this paper, we would like to propose a new practical method to calculate the\ncollective subspace.\nThe adiabatic approximation has been often utilized for formulating the theory of collective subspace.\nIndeed, some class of LACM, such as nuclear fissions, can be regarded as a slow motion, thus justifying\nthe adiabatic approximation. The adiabatic TDHF (ATDHF) theory [1\u20133] is one of the most well known\nadiabatic theories and has been applied in some cases to realistic description of heavy ion reactions [3]. The\nATDHF theory, however, accompanied a problem of non-uniqueness of the solution [4,5]. Later, efforts to\nsettle the non-uniqueness problem were made from different view points. The works of Ref. [6] emphasize\nthe importance of the canonical variable condition and the analyticity as a function of collective coordinate\nfor finding a unique solution. The proposed procedure relying on the Taylor expansion method has not been\napplied to realistic calculations. Another work [7] pointed out that the collective subspace can be uniquely\ndetermined by using the next order equation of the ATDHF theory. It is clarified also that the adiabatic\ncollective path of LACM becomes the valley line of the potential function in the multi-dimensional space\nassociated with the TDHF states [7\u20139]. Further, the adiabatic collective path can be defined by equations\nfor a local harmonic mode at each point of the collective path. These developments are summarized in a\nconsistent way in the formalism of Ref. [8]. Note however that the adiabatic theory of Ref. [8] relys on a\nmulti-dimensional classical phase space representation of the TDHF determinantal states [17,18]. A realistic\napplication of this theory has not been done yet except for the one to a light nucleus [19]. Furthermore a\nproblem of particle number conservation arises when applied to superconducting nuclei [10].\nTheories without the adiabatic approximation have been also developed within the TDHF framework. The\nearly works of this direction are called local harmonic approximations [12,13]. Later, a set of general equations\nthat can determine the collective subspace and the collective Hamiltonian were found and formulated in a\nconsistent form known as the selfconsistent collective coordinate method (SCC or SCCM) [14]. The theory\nis purely based on the TDHF with no further approximation. The method also provides a concrete and\npractical scheme to solve the basic equations using a power series expansion with respect to the boson-like\nvariables defined as a linear combination of the collective coordinates and momenta. The pairing correlation\nin superconducting nuclei is easily incorporated within the SCCM by adopting the time-dependent HartreeFock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) equation in place of the TDHF, and the conservation law of the particle number\nis consistently introduced in the basic framework of the SCCM [15]. Thanks to these features the SCCM\nhas been applied for many realistic descriptions of anharmonic vibrations in medium and heavy nuclei [16].\nHowever, the expansion method may not be suitable for the large amplitude motions of adiabatic nature, for\nwhich change of the nuclear mean-field is so large that the power series expansion of the collective coordinates\nmay not be justified.\nIn the present paper, we try to combine merits of two approaches mentioned above, i.e. the SCCM and\nthe adiabatic thoery in order to formulate a theory that provides a consistent and practical method easily\napplicable to realistic descriptions of the adiabatic LACM in superconducting nuclei. We achieve this aim by\nintroducing an adiabatic approximation to the general framework of SCCM. Here we treat superconducting\nnuclei since the pairing correlations play essential roles in many cases, like spontaneous fission, tunneling\nbetween superdeformed and normal deformed configurations, and coupling between coexisting states with\ndifferent nuclear shape (shape coexistence phenomena). Although the use of the superconducting mean field\n2\n\n\frequires us to respect the particle number conservation, the SCCM allows a simple and consistent treatment\nof the conservation law. We also avoid the non-uniqueness problem by utilizing the principles similar to that\nof Refs. [7\u20139]. Furthermore, we shall show that the equations of the adiabatic SCCM thus formulated can\nbe transformed to another set of equations that have a similar structure as the local harmonic approach to\nthe adiabatic theories [8]. Therefore, the present formalism is not only an extension of the SCCM, but also\nsucceeds some aspects of the recent adiabatic theories such as Ref. [8].\nIn addition to the general formulation (Sect.II), we present a practical scheme to solve the basic equations\ngiven in the local harmonic form for general classes of the many-body nuclear Hamiltonian (Sect.III and\nAppendix). These equations are given in terms of the matrix elements of the many-body Hamiltonian\nexpressed by the quasiparticle operators, thus enabling ones to develop a straightforward coding of a numerical\nprogram to solve the equations. In this way, we provide a complete procedure to extract the collective subspace\nand the collective Hamiltonian. We also discuss a possible prescription to extend the formalism to the cases\nof the multi-dimensional collective motions (Sect.IV). Conclusions are outlined in Sect.V.\nII. BASIC EQUATIONS\nA. The SCC method for superconducting nuclei\n\nIn this subsection, we recapitulate the basic equations of the SCC method [14] in a way suitable for treating\nthe superconducting nuclei.\nWe introduce the TDHFB approximation to describe LACM in superconducting many-fermion systems.\nHere the time-dependent many-body state vector |\u03c6(t)i is constrained to a generalized Slater determinant,\nwhich is chosen as a variational wave function. Time evolution of |\u03c6(t)i is then determined by the timedependent variational principle\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(t)| i\n\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u0124 |\u03c6(t)i = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the variation is given by \u03b4 |\u03c6(t)i = a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 |\u03c6(t)i in terms of the quasiparticle operators {a\u2020\u03b1 , a\u03b1 } which\nsatisfy the vacuum condition a\u03b1 |\u03c6(t)i = 0.\nWe assume that the LACM can be described in terms of the collective variables, i.e. the collective coordinate\nand momentum {q, p} that are variables parameterizing the TDHFB state vector.\u2217 The whole space of the\nTDHFB state vectors can be parameterized by M \u00d7 (M \u2212 1) variables (M being the number of the single\nparticle states) as shown by the generalized Thouless theorem [17,18]. A set of the TDHFB state vector\n|\u03c6(q, p)i forms the collective subspace in which the LACM can be properly described. One of the main\nproblems we concern is how to determine the collective subspace on the basis of the TDHFB equations of\nmotion. At the same time, we need to determine the collective Hamiltonian H(q, p) that governs the equation\nof motion for the collective variables {q, p}. This is a general purpose of theories of LACM.\nWhen we apply the LACM theories to nuclei in the superconducting phase, a special attention has to be\npaid to the particle number conservation. Since the TDHFB state vector is not an eigenstate of the particle\nnumber operator N\u0302 , one would like to formulate the LACM theory so that the particle number expectation\nvalue is conserved during the course of collective motion. This is a problem which is specific to the TDHFB,\nbut not to TDHF for which the state vector is a number eigenstate.\nIt is well known [17] that the expectation value of a conserved observable is kept constant during the\ntime-evolution of |\u03c6(t)i governed by the TDHF(B) equations of motion. In the case of the pairing problem,\nthe TDHFB state vector violates spontaneously the symmetry with respect to the gauge rotation e\u2212i\u03c6N\u0302 , but\na rotational motion related to the gauge rotation (often called the pairing rotation) emerges automatically\nto restore the gauge symmetry. Therefore, the LACM of superconducting nuclei, described by the TDHFB\ntheory, necessarily accompany the pairing rotation, for which we introduce the collective coordinate, \u03c6, the\ngauge angle, and the conjugate collective momenta, N , which represents the particle number [15]. Thus,\n\n\u2217\n\nWe focus our discussion on a case of single collective coordinate. A multi-dimensional case is discussed in Sect.IV.\n\n3\n\n\fwe are obliged to consider a collective subspace that is parameterized by the set of four collective variables\n{q, p, \u03c6, N }.\u2020\nLet us now present the basic equations of the SCCM that determine the collective subspace |\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i\nand the collective Hamiltonian H(q, p, \u03c6, N ). As discussed above, the variable \u03c6 is introduced to represent\nthe gauge angle. This requirement is easily satisfied [15] if one uses the following parameterization\n|\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i = e\u2212i\u03c6N\u0302 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N\u0302 is the number operator of particles. Here |\u03c6(q, p, N )i represents an intrinsic state that rotates in\nthe gauge space.\nBasic equations of the SCCM consists of a canonical variable condition and invariance principle of the\ntime-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDHFB equation in our case). The canonical variable condition is, in\ngeneral, given by\n\u2202\n\u2202S\n|\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i = p +\n,\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u2202\n\u2202S\nh\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )|\n|\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i = \u2212 ,\ni\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\u2202\n\u2202S\nh\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )| i\n|\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i = N +\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202S\n\u2202\n|\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i = \u2212\n,\nh\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )|\ni\u2202N\n\u2202N\nh\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )| i\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n(3c)\n(3d)\n\nfor the collective subspace parameterized by two sets of coordinates (q, \u03c6) and momenta (p, N ). Although S\nis an arbitrary function of {q, p, \u03c6, N }, we choose S = 0 which is appropriate for the adiabatic approximation\n[6]. Then the canonical variable condition can be rewritten as equations for the state |\u03c6(q, p, N )i,\n\u2202\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i = p,\n\u2202q\n\u2202\nh\u03c6(q, p, N )|\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i = 0,\ni\u2202p\nh\u03c6(q, p, N )| i\n\nh\u03c6(q, p, N )| N\u0302 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i = N,\n\u2202\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i = 0.\nh\u03c6(q, p, N )|\ni\u2202N\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n(4c)\n(4d)\n\nThe third equation requires that the collective variable N is identical to the expectation value of the number\noperator. In other words, the particle number expectation value does not depend on the collective variables\n(q, p) for the LACM under consideration. This is nothing but the condition of particle number conservation.\nThe collective Hamiltonian is defined as value of the total energy on the collective subspace, given by\nH = h\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )| \u0124 |\u03c6(q, p, \u03c6, N )i\n= h\u03c6(q, p, N )| \u0124 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i .\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nSince the Hamiltonian \u0124 commutes with the number operator N\u0302 , the collective Hamiltonian does not depend\non the gauge angle \u03c6. Therefore, \u03c6 becomes cyclic as we expect.\nThe invariance principle of the TDHFB equation plays a central role to determine the collective subspace,\nwhich requires that the TDHFB state vector |\u03c6(q(t), p(t), \u03c6(t), N (t))i evolving in time within the collective\nsubspace should obey the full TDHFB equation, Eq.(1). This is equivalent to a condition that the collective\nsubspace is an invariant subspace of the TDHFB equations of motion. Inserting Eq.(2) into the timedependent variational principle, Eq.(1), one obtains\n\n\u2020\nFor simplicity, here we assume a single kind of particles. Extension to systems with many kinds (e.g., protons and\nneutrons in nuclei) is straightforward.\n\n4\n\n\f\u03b4 h\u03c6(q, p, N )| \u0124 \u2212\n\ndq \u25e6\ndp \u25e6\ndN \u25e6\nd\u03c6\nN\u0302 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i = 0,\nP + Q+\n\u0398\u2212\ndt\ndt\ndt\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the infinitesimal generators defined by\n\u25e6\n\n\u2202\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i ,\nP |\u03c6(q, p, N )i = i \u2202q\n\u25e6\n\nQ |\u03c6(q, p, N )i =\n\n1 \u2202\ni \u2202p\n\n\u0398 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i =\n\n1 \u2202\ni \u2202N\n\n\u25e6\n\n(7a)\n\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i ,\n\n(7b)\n\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i\n\n(7c)\n\nare used.

By taking the parameterization, Eq.(2), and the specific choice of S = 0\nin Eq.(3), the allowed canonical transformations are restricted to the point transformations [6].\nB. Adiabatic approximation\n\nAssuming that the LACM described by the collective variables {q, p} is slow motion, we here introduce\nthe adiabatic approximation to the SCCM. Namely we shall expand the basic equations with respect to\nthe collective momentum p, which is appropriate for small value of momentum. Since the particle number\n5\n\n\fvariable N is a momentum variable in the present formulation, we also expand the basic equations with\nrespect to n = N \u2212 N0 , when we consider a system with particle number N0 .\nLet us first consider the expansion of the TDHFB state vector |\u03c6(q, p, N )i in the collective subspace. The\norigin of the expansion is the state |\u03c6(q)i \u2261 |\u03c6(q, p, N )i |p=0,N =N0 . We can assume that this is a timeeven state, i.e., T |\u03c6(q)i = |\u03c6(q)i under the time-reversal operation T (Here we consider the system of even\nnumbers of particles). Thanks to the generalized Thouless theorem, the state vector |\u03c6(q, p, N )i is expressed\nas\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i = ei\u011c(q,p,n) |\u03c6(q)i\nby using the unitary transformation ei\u011c(q,p,n) . Here the hermitian operator \u011c is given by\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u011c(q, p, n) =\nG\u03b1\u03b2 (q, p, n)a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 + G\u2217\u03b1\u03b2 (q, p, n)a\u03b2 a\u03b1 = \u011c(q, p, n)\u2020 .\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nHere and hereafter, the quasiparticle operators {a\u2020\u03b1 , a\u03b1 } are always defined locally at each value of q and\nsatisfy the condition a\u03b1 |\u03c6(q)i = 0. We now expand the operator \u011c(q, p, n) in powers of p and n and keep\nonly the lowest order term. Namely,\n\u011c(q, p, n) = pQ\u0302(q) + n\u0398\u0302(q),\n\u0011\nX\u0010\nQ\u0302(q) =\nQ\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 + Q\u2217\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u03b2 a\u03b1 = Q\u0302(q)\u2020 ,\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n\n\u0011\n\u0398\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 + \u0398\u2217\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u03b2 a\u03b1 = \u0398\u0302(q)\u2020 .\n\n(14c)\n\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\n\u0398\u0302(q) =\n\nX\u0010\n\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nIf we require that time-reversal of |\u03c6(q, p, N )i causes sign inversion of the collective momentum p, i.e.\nT |\u03c6(q, p, N )i = |\u03c6(q, \u2212p, N )i, the operators Q\u0302(q) and \u0398\u0302(q) are time-even (T Q\u0302(q)T \u22121 = Q\u0302(q)) and time-odd\n(T \u0398\u0302(q)T \u22121 = \u2212\u0398\u0302(q)), respectively. If we put n = 0 (i.e. N = N0 ), the parameterization Eq.(12) together\nwith Eq.(14) reduces to |\u03c6(q, p)i = eipQ\u0302(q) |\u03c6(q)i , which is the same form as the one introduced by Villars\nand often used in the ATDHF theories [1,3,7].\nThe collective Hamiltonian is expanded as\n1\nH(q, p, N ) = V (q) + B(q)p2 + \u03bb(q)n,\n2\nV (q) = H(q, p, N )|p=0,N =N0 = h\u03c6(q)| \u0124 |\u03c6(q)i ,\n\n(15a)\n(15b)\n\n2\n\n1 \u2202 H(q, p, N )\n|p=0,N =N0 = \u2212 h\u03c6(q)| [[\u0124, Q\u0302(q)], Q\u0302(q)] |\u03c6(q)i ,\n2\n\u2202p2\n\u2202H(q, p, N )\n|p=0,N =N0 = h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124, i\u0398\u0302(q)] |\u03c6(q)i ,\n\u03bb(q) =\n\u2202N\n\nB(q) =\n\n(15c)\n(15d)\n\nwhere we kept the collective momentum p up to the second order, while up to the first order in n.

As we mentioned in Sect.I, the ATDHF\ntheory has the problem that the solution satisfying these two equations is not uniquely determined [4,5]. Although an additional validity condition was introduced to further constrain the solutions [3,4], the procedure\nof Ref. [3] does not fully solve the problem since the method does not work around the HF minima.\nThe non-uniqueness problem has been investigated in recent developments of the adiabatic theories, and in\nour opinion they are classified into two different approaches. The first one represented by Ref. [6] claims that\nthe solution is uniquely determined if an RPA boundary condition is specified at the HF minimum and if the\nanalyticity of the collective path as a function of q is imposed together with the canonical variable condition.\nThe solution, however, needs to be constructed in an analytic way or by means of a Taylor expansion method\nwith respect to the collective coordinate q. We do not adopt this approach since we wish to construct a\nmethod applicable to systems under large excursion from the HFB minimum. We rather follow the other\napproach represented by Refs. [7\u20139]. These theories require an additional condition that the equation of\ncollective subspace (corresponding to the decoupling condition in Ref. [8]) should be satisfied up to the next\norder of the adiabatic expansion. In the present formulation, this second order condition is expressed as\nfollows.\nThe second order equation of collective subspace:\n1\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [[\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , Q\u0302(q)], Q\u0302(q)] \u2212 B(q)\u2206Q\u0302(q) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n2\n\n(36)\n\nwhere\n\u2202 Q\u0302\n+ \u0393(q)Q\u0302(q),\n\u2202q\n1 \u2202B\n\u0393(q) = \u2212\n.\n2B(q) \u2202q\n\n\u2206Q\u0302(q) =\n\n(37)\n(38)\n\nThis equation is equivalent in its mathematical form to the one given by Ref. [7] if the chemical potential\nterm \u2212\u03bb(q)N\u0302 is neglected. The last term \u2212B(q)\u2206Q\u0302(q), often called a curvature term, was simply neglected\nin the original version of local harmonic approximation [12,13]. In the next subsection, instead of neglecting\nthis curvature term, we shall rewrite \u2206Q\u0302(q) and change Eq.(36) into a workable form.\nIt is worth noting here the invariance of the adiabatic equations against the coordinate transformation. The\ncollective momentum p undergoes the linear homogeneous transformation under the point transformation,\nEq.(11). Therefore, different orders of the expansion with respect to the power of p are not mixed up under\nthe point transformation. The invariance property of the basic equations of SCCM is thus inherited to each\nequation of the adiabatic approximation listed above.

To this end, we first derive, from the adiabatic equations, another set of equations of collective\nsubspace which can be solved in a way similar to the RPA equation.\nWe first take a derivative of the zeroth order equation, Eq.(34), with respect to q, which leads to\n\u2202V\n1\n\u2202\u03bb\nN\u0302 |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , P\u0302 (q)] \u2212 C(q)Q\u0302(q) \u2212\n\u2206Q\u0302(q) \u2212\ni\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u22022V\n\u2202V\nC(q) =\n\u2212 \u0393(q)\n,\n2\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nwhere \u2206Q\u0302(q) and \u0393(q) are given by Eqs.(37) and (38), respectively. Using Eqs.(36), we eliminate \u2206Q\u0302(q) and\nrewrite Eq.(40) as\n1\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202V\n1\nQ\u0302(q)], Q\u0302(q)] \u2212\nN\u0302 |\u03c6(q)i = 0.\n[[\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 ,\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , P\u0302 (q)] \u2212 C(q)Q\u0302(q) \u2212\ni\n2B(q)\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\n(42)\n\nFurthermore, due to Eq.(34), we find\n\u2202V\nQ\u0302 = (\u0124 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 )A ,\n\u2202q\n\n(43)\n\nwhere (\u0124 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 )A means a\u2020 a\u2020 and aa part of the operator \u0124 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 containing two-quasiparticle creation and\nannihilation in the normal-ordered expression.\nWe thus replace Eqs.(34)-(36) by the equivalent set,\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| \u0124M (q) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n\n(44)\n\n1\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124M (q), Q\u0302(q)] \u2212 B(q)P\u0302 (q) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\ni\n\n(45)\n\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03bb\nN\u0302 |\u03c6(q)i = 0.\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124M (q), P\u0302 (q)] \u2212 C(q)Q\u0302(q) \u2212\n[[\u0124M (q), (\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 )A ], Q\u0302(q)] \u2212\ni\n2B(q)\n\u2202q\n\n(46)\n\nIn Eq.(45) and (46), \u0124 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 has been replaced by\n\u0124M (q) = \u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 \u2212\n\n\u2202V\nQ\u0302(q),\n\u2202q\n\n(47)\n\nsince the last term has no influence. The operator \u0124M (q) may be regarded as the Hamiltonian in the moving\nframe. The second and third terms can be identified with generalized cranking terms associated with the\npairing rotation and the LACM, respectively.\nEquations (45) and (46) are linear equations with respect to the one-body operators Q\u0302(q) and P\u0302 (q). They\nhave essentially the same structure as the standard RPA equations except for the last two terms in Eq.(46).\nThe quantity C(q) is the local stiffness parameter defined as the second (covariant) derivative of the collective\npotential V (q). The infinitesimal generators Q\u0302(q) and P\u0302 (q) are thus closely related to the harmonic normal\n9\n\n\fmodes locally defined for |\u03c6(q)i and the moving frame Hamiltonian \u0124M (q). These equations may be called\nlocal harmonic equations.\nIt was shown in Ref. [7] that the zeroth, first and second order equations of ATDHF give a valley line\nof a potential energy surface in a multi-dimensional configuration space associated with the TDHF states.\nSimilarly, the local harmonic equations we have obtained, Eqs.(44)-(46), define the valley of the multidimensional potential energy surface. The solution of these equations will be uniquely determined if a\nsuitable boundary condition is specified. These features are similar to the formulation of Ref. [8] where the\nvalley equation of the potential energy surface is derived from the decoupling condition.\nWe remark again that the local harmonic equations in the present paper differ from the ones of RoweBassermann [12] and Marumori [13] with respect to the the third and the fourth terms of Eq.(46), which\narise from the curvature term (derivative of the generator) and the particle number constraint, respectively.\nIt is important to keep the curvature term in order to maintain the relation between the collective subspace\nand the valley of the potential surface. We also note that the present formalism is invariant with respect to\nthe point transformation of the collective coordinate, as is the formulation of Ref. [8].\nB. Matrix Formulation of Local Harmonic Equations\n\nLet us now give a procedure to find the operators Q\u0302(q), P\u0302 (q) that satisfy the local harmonic equations,\n(45) and (46) , for a given state |\u03c6(q)i. Since they are linear equations with respect to these operators, it can\nbe solved in an analogous way to the standard RPA. To show this, we first express the operator P\u0302 (q) and N\u0302\nin terms of the quasiparticle operators:\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u2217\n(48)\nP\u0302 (q) = i\nP\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 \u2212 P\u03b1\u03b2\n(q)a\u03b2 a\u03b1 = P\u0302 (q)\u2020 ,\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nN\u0302 =\n\nX\u0010\n\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\n\u0011\n\u2217\nN\u03b1\u03b2 (q)a\u2020\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b2 + N\u03b1\u03b2\n(q)a\u03b2 a\u03b1 .\n\n(49)\n\nNote that the a\u2020 a and c-number parts are neglected here since they do not change the state vector |\u03c6(q)i except\nfor the phase. The Hamiltonian \u0124 is also expressed in terms of the same quasiparticle operators. Assuming\nthat the matrix elements Q\u03b1\u03b2 , P\u03b1\u03b2 are real, the local harmonic equations are written as the following matrix\nequations.\n(A \u2212 B)Q \u2212 B(q)P = 0,\n1\n(A + B)P \u2212 C(q)Q \u2212\nDQ \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 N = 0,\nB(q)\n\n(50a)\n(50b)\n\nP T N = 0,\n\n(50c)\n\nT\n\n2Q P = 1,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u03bb\u2032 =\n.\n\u2202q\n\n(50d)\n(50e)\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nHere all quantities are functions of q, and Q = (..., Q\u03b1\u03b2 , ...) , P = (..., P\u03b1\u03b2 , ...) , and N = (..., N\u03b1\u03b2 , ...) ,\nare the vector representation of the matrix elements with \u03b1 > \u03b2.

The matrix\nelements of the residual interactions in Eqs.(52b)-(52d) are antisymmetrized with respect to the quasiparticle\nindices. The matrices A and B have the same structures as the ones often defined in the quasiparticle RPA\nformalism [17].

These terms of the Hamiltonian do not\ncontribute to the standard RPA equations.\nThe solution of the matrix equations is obtained as follows. From Eq.(50), one obtains\n\u22121\n\nQ = \u03bb\u2032 B(q) ((A + B)(A \u2212 B) \u2212 D \u2212 \u03a9)\n\u2032\n\nN,\n\u22121\n\nP = \u03bb (A \u2212 B) ((A + B)(A \u2212 B) \u2212 D \u2212 \u03a9)\n\n(56a)\nN,\n\n(56b)\n\nwith\n\u03a9 = B(q)C(q).\n\n(57)\n\nThe condition that the collective mode is orthogonal to the number operator, Eq.(50c), gives the following\nequation\nS(\u03a9) \u2261 N T (A \u2212 B) ((A + B)(A \u2212 B) \u2212 D \u2212 \u03a9)\n\n\u22121\n\nN = 0.\n(58)\n\u221a\nThe quantity \u03a9 = B(q)C(q) represents the square of the frequency \u03c9 = BC of the local harmonic mode,\nwhich is not necessarily positive. This equation can be regarded as a dispersion equation to determine\n\u03a9 = \u03c9 2 as a zero point of S(\u03a9). The normalization condition, Eq.(50d), then gives a constraint on the value\nof \u03bb\u20322 B(q). The value of the mass parameter B(q) is arbitrary, being related to the invariance under the\npoint transformation Eq.(11). A choice of the coordinate, q, specifies a value of the mass parameter, B(q).\nIn practice, the coordinate is often scaled so as to make the mass parameter unity.\nWhen the residual interactions are the separable forces such as the monopole pairing and the quadruplequadrupole forces, the local harmonic equations reduce to a simpler form. The dispersion equation for the\nseparable interaction does not require a matrix inversion as in Eq.(58). The details are discussed in Appendix.\nRef. [10] has discussed a problem of spurious (Nambu-Goldstone) modes for local harmonic approaches, and\nstated that the RPA equation at non-equilibrium points must be extended in order to guarantee separation\nof the spurious modes. However, no practical way of solving the equation was given because the equation\nhas parameters which we do not have a method to calculate. In our present formulation, the RPA equation\nis indeed extended to assure the number conservation.\n11\n\n\fC. Construction of Collective Subspace\n\nLet us finally give algorithms to construct the collective subspace |\u03c6(q)i as a function of the collective\ncoordinate q. Note that the local harmonic equations, Eqs.(44)-(46), are regarded as local equations in a\nsense that the equations can be solved independently for different values of q. At the HFB ground state,\n|\u03c60 i, defined by the HFB equation\n\u03b4 h\u03c60 | \u0124 \u2212 \u03bb0 N\u0302 |\u03c60 i = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nwe find \u2202V /\u2202q = 0. Therefore, |\u03c60 i is always a state on the collective subspace because Eq.(44) is automatically satisfied. Eqs. (45) and (46) reduce to the standard RPA equations at |\u03c60 i since the last two terms in\nEq.(46) vanishes. The operators Q\u0302, P\u0302 are then determined as one of the normal modes of the RPA equation.\nFor non-equilibrium states, in general, Eq.(44) and the other two equations, (45) and (46), are coupled. We\nmay solve the coupled equations in an iterative way. As discussed in Sect. III B, one can find the operators\nQ\u0302(q)(n) , P\u0302 (q)(n) by solving Eqs.(45) and (46) for a given trial state |\u03c6(q)i(n) (n denoting the iteration step).\n\u0010 \u0011(n)\nThis defines the moving frame Hamiltonian \u0124M (q)(n+1) = \u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)(n+1) N\u0302 \u2212 \u2202V\nQ\u0302(q)(n) , which can\n\u2202q\n(n+1)\n\nbe used to construct a trial state |\u03c6(q)i\nfor the next iteration. If the iteration converges, one obtains a\nstate |\u03c6(q)i on which Eqs. (44)-(46) are simultaneously satisfied. Repeating the same procedure for different\nvalues of q, one finally obtains the collective subspace |\u03c6(q)i and the collective Hamiltonian as a function of\nq.\nWe remark here that the operator P\u0302 (q) thus determined does not guarantee Eq.(21), although the other\nequations are satisfied. In this sense, the local harmonic solution is an approximate solution. The exact\nsolution satisfying all the basic equations in Sect.II B may not exist in realistic situations. Only when the\nsystem is \"exactly decoupled\" [8], the above procedure gives the exact solution.\nIt is possible to choose another algorithm which satisfies Eq.(21) at the sacrifice of errors in Eq. (44). Let\n|\u03c6(q0 )i be a solution that satisfies the basic equations at q = q0 . The infinitesimal generators Q\u0302(q0 ), P\u0302 (q0 ) are\ndetermined by solving Eqs.(45) and (46). Then one can generate the state |\u03c6(q0 + \u03b4q)i for an infinitesimal\nshift of the collective coordinate as\n|\u03c6(q0 + \u03b4q)i = e\u2212i\u03b4qP\u0302 (q0 ) |\u03c6(q0 )i .\n\n(60)\n\nRepeating this procedure, one can construct a collective subspace. This solution should coincide with the\none solved by the previous method if the system is exactly decoupled. Difference between the two gives a\nquality of decoupling for the collective subspace in the adiabatic approximation. The second procedure can\nbe used to provide an initial guess, |\u03c6(q)i(0) , for the iteration of the first method.\nIV. EXTENSION TO MULTI-DIMENSIONAL COLLECTIVE SUBSPACE\n\nIn this section we extend the adiabatic SCC method to a case of multi-dimensional collective subspace\ndescribed by D collective coordinates and conjugate momenta {q i , pi ; i = 1, ..., D}.\nOne can easily derive the basic equations of the adiabatic SCC method in parallel to the derivation given\nin Sections II by noting first that Eqs.(12,14) are now extended to\n|\u03c6(q, p, N )i = ei\u011c(q,p,n) |\u03c6(q)i ,\ni\n\n\u011c = pi Q\u0302 (q) + n\u0398\u0302(q),\n\n(61)\n(62)\n\nwhere the operator Q\u0302i (q) have now D components having coordinate label i. It is implied here and hereafter\nthat the same coordinate index (i in the above expression) appearing in the super- and subscripts means\nto take the summation over it. The infinitesimal generator P\u0302i (q) have also D components each of which\nis related to the derivative i \u2202q\u2202 i |\u03c6(q)i. In the following, the coordinate dependence is often omitted.

Quantities which have a coordinate index in the subscript and in the superscript have the\ntransformation properties of the covariant and contravariant vectors, respectively. For example,\n\u0001\n(76)\nQ\u0302i \u2192 Q\u0302\u2032i = Q\u0302j \u00d7 \u2202q \u2032i /\u2202q j ,\n\u0001\n\u2032\nj\n\u2032i\n(77)\nP\u0302i \u2192 P\u0302i = P\u0302j \u00d7 \u2202q /\u2202q .\n\nThe mass tensor B ij is the contravariant tensor of second rank. The operator Q\u0302i;j defined by Eq.(67) is the\ncovariant derivative of Q\u0302i , and \u0393ikj is the Christoffel symbol where the mass tensor Bij plays the role of\nmetric tensor.\nLet us now derive local harmonic equations of collective subspace.

This was done for the D = 1 case with help\nof the second order equation of the collective subspace. The corresponding equations (66) give D(D + 1)/2\nconstraints, while number of unknown parameters, Q\u0302j;i , is D2 . In fact, Eq.(66) is equivalent to\n1\n1 \u2202V\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [[\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , Q\u0302j ], Q\u0302i ] + [[ k Q\u0302k , Q\u0302j ], Q\u0302i ] \u2212 (B ik Q\u0302j;k + R\u0302ij ) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n2\n6 \u2202q\n\n(80)\n\nwhere R\u0302ij are arbitrary one-body operators which are antisymmetric for exchange of indices i and j. If we\nj\n\u2202V\nchoose R\u0302ij = 0, we can eliminate the derivative term \u2202q\nj Q\u0302;i . Then, Eq.(78) leads to\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , P\u0302i ] \u2212 Cij Q\u0302j \u2212 [[\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 , (\u0124 \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 )A ], Bij Q\u0302j ] \u2212 i N\u0302 |\u03c6(q)i = 0.\ni\n2\n\u2202q\n\n(81)\n\nThis equation is an analog of Eq.(46) and is linear with respect to the infinitesimal generators Q\u0302i , P\u0302i . We\ncan numerically solve Eqs.(64), (65) and (81) on the same line as in Sect.III B and III C.\nIt should be remarked that the local harmonic equation Eq.(81) for D > 1 are derived from equations, (64)\nand (66), but with an additional condition R\u0302ij = 0 in Eq.(80). This condition is introduced to obtain the\nlocal harmonic equations parallel to the one-dimensional case.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have formulated the adiabatic approximation to the general framework of the selfconsistent collective\ncoordinate method in order to describe large amplitude collective motions in superconducting nuclei. The\nformalism, based on the TDHFB equations of motion, guarantees the conservation of particle number in\na transparent way. We have shown that the equations of collective subspace are reduced to local linear\nequations for the infinitesimal generators, which can be solved with use of quasiparticle representation of\nthe Hamiltonian matrix elements. This provides a complete procedure to determine the states eipQ\u0302(q) |\u03c6(q)i\nin the collective subspace and the collective Hamiltonian H(q, p) = V (q) + 21 B(q)p2 as a function of the\ncollective coordinate q and momentum p. A possible extension to the case of the multi-dimensional collective\ncoordinates is also discussed.\nWe emphasize that the equations given in this paper are solvable by means of the matrix method similar\nto the standard RPA. We hope that the present adiabatic theory is useful to solve number of open questions\nin the realistic studies of nuclear large amplitude collective motion.\nAPPENDIX: SOLUTION FOR THE SEPARABLE INTERACTIONS\n\nIn this appendix, we give solutions of the local harmonic equations of collective subspace for the case where\nthe two-body interaction is given by the separable forces. We assume that the Hamiltonian is given by\n\u0124 = \u01250 \u2212\n\n\u03ba \u2020\nF\u0302 F\u0302 ,\n2\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u01250 (= \u0125\u20200 ) and F\u0302 are one-body operators. Equivalently, one may write\n\u03ba (+) (+) \u03ba (\u2212) (\u2212)\nF\u0302 F\u0302\n+ F\u0302 F\u0302 ,\n2\n2\n\u2020\n\u2261 (F\u0302 \u00b1 F\u0302 )/2 = \u00b1F\u0302 (\u00b1)\u2020 .\n\n\u0124 = \u01250 \u2212\n\n(A2)\n\nF\u0302 (\u00b1)\n\n(A3)\n\nFor the separable forces, it is customary to neglect the Fock term of the forces. This approximation is easily\nand consistently implemented in the SCCM by assuming that the equation of motion for the time-dependent\nmean-field state |\u03c6(t)i is now given by the time-dependent Hartree-Bogoliubov equation without the Fock\nterms,\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u0125(t) |\u03c6(t)i = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u0125(t) = \u01250 \u2212 \u03baF\u0302 (+) h\u03c6(t)| F\u0302 (+) |\u03c6(t)i + \u03baF\u0302 (\u2212) h\u03c6(t)| F\u0302 (\u2212) |\u03c6(t)i .\n\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(t)| i\n\n14\n\n(A4)\n(A5)\n\n\fThe local harmonic equations (44)-(46) then become\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| \u0125M (q) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n\n(A6)\n\n1\n(\u2212)\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0125M (q), Q\u0302(q)] \u2212 fQ F\u0302 (\u2212) \u2212 B(q)P\u0302 (q) |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\ni\n\n(A7)\n\n1\n(+)\n(+)\n\u03b4 h\u03c6(q)| [\u0125M (q), B(q)P\u0302 (q)] \u2212 fP F\u0302 (+) \u2212 B(q)C(q)Q\u0302(q) \u2212 fR F\u0302 (+)\ni\n(\u2212)\n\u2212[F\u0302 (\u2212) , (\u0125(q) \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 )A ]fQ \u2212 fN N\u0302 |\u03c6(q)i = 0,\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere \u0125M (q) is the mean-field Hamiltonian in the moving frame defined by\n\u0125M (q) = \u0125(q) \u2212\n\n\u2202V\nQ\u0302(q) \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 ,\n\u2202q\n\n\u0125(q) = \u01250 \u2212 \u03baF\u0302 (+) h\u03c6(q)| F\u0302 (+) |\u03c6(q)i ,\n\n(A9)\n(A10)\n\nand definitions of other symbols are\n(\u2212)\n\n= \u2212\u03ba h\u03c6(q)| [F\u0302 (\u2212) , Q\u0302(q)] |\u03c6(q)i ,\n1\n(+)\nfP = \u03ba h\u03c6(q)| [F\u0302 (+) , B(q)P\u0302 (q)] |\u03c6(q)i ,\ni\n(+)\nfR = \u2212\u03ba h\u03c6(q)| [[F\u0302 (+) , (\u0125(q) \u2212 \u03bb(q)N\u0302 )A ], Q\u0302(q)] |\u03c6(q)i /2,\n\u2202\u03bb\nfN = B(q) .\n\u2202q\nfQ\n\n(A11a)\n(A11b)\n(A11c)\n(A11d)\n\nWe express all operators in the above equations in terms of the quasiparticle operators {a\u2020\u03b1 , a\u03b1 } defined for\n\u0125M (q) and |\u03c6(q)i.
