More recent studies confirm these conclusions at roughly the 99.9% level [9] while revealing\nmysterious alignments with the ecliptic plane [3], suggesting either a hitherto unknown solar system effect on\nthe microwave background or an error in the collection\nand/or processing of the WMAP data. Other researchers\nfind the l = 4 multipole is generic, the l = 5 multipole is\nunusually non-planar at the 99.8% level, and the l = 6\nmultipole is unusually planar at the 98.6% level [4]. No\nexplanation is yet known for these strange results.\nMultipole vectors provide a convenient means to quantify the planarity of a given multipole, as well as to\ncompare the alignment of two different multipoles [5].\nThe present authors, coming from a background in pure\nmathematics, were unable to decipher the formalism and\nterminology of Ref. [5] and chose instead to re-create the\nmultipole vector concept from scratch. The real-valued\nspherical harmonics of order l are precisely the homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree l in the variables\nx, y and z (for example Y20 is the polynomial x2 +y 2 \u22122z 2 ,\nup to normalization), so the present authors sought to\nunderstand the multipole vectors of Copi, Huterer and\nStarkman (CHS) from a polynomial point of view.\nTranslated to the language of polynomials, CHS's motivating goal (see Eqn. (10) of [5]) was to factor every\nhomogeneous harmonic polynomial P of degree l into a\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: gkatz@bennington.edu\naddress: www.geometrygames.org/contact.html\n\nproduct of linear factors\nP (x, y, z) = \u03bb * (a1 x + b1 y + c1 z)\n* (a2 x + b2 y + c2 z)\n***\n* (al x + bl y + cl z).\n\n(1)\n\nSuch a factorization is of course impossible in general,\nas CHS implicitly acknowledge by their introduction of\nsuitable error terms. In the language of polynomials the\ncorrect statement of the theorem is\nTheorem 1. Every homogeneous polynomial P of degree\nl in x, y and z may be written as\nP (x, y, z) = \u03bb * (a1 x + b1 y + c1 z)\n* (a2 x + b2 y + c2 z)\n***\n* (al x + bl y + cl z)\n+ (x2 + y 2 + z 2 ) * R,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the remainder term R is a homogeneous polynomial of degree l \u2212 2. The decomposition is unique up to\nreordering and rescaling the linear factors.\nNotes: (a) Theorem 1 lives entirely in the realm of real\npolynomials: the coefficients of P , R and all the linear\nfactors ai x+bi y+ci z are assumed to be real. (b) Theorem\n1 does not require the polynomial P to be harmonic.\nIn cosmological applications we are interested only in\nthe value of the polynomial on the unit sphere S 2 ; we\nignore its value on the rest of Euclidean 3-space. On the\nunit sphere the factor x2 +y 2 +z 2 is identically 1, so in this\ncase Theorem 1 says that any homogeneous polynomial\nP may be written as a product of linear factors \u03bb(a1 x +\nb1 y + c1 z) * * * (al x + bl y + cl z) plus a remainder term R of\nlower degree. Applying this reasoning recursively gives\nthe easy\n\n\f2\nCorollary 2. When restricted to the unit sphere, every\npolynomial P of degree l in x, y and z may be written as\nP(x,y,z) =\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\n\u03bbl * (al,1 x + bl,1 y + cl,1 z) * (al,2 x + bl,2 y + cl,2 z)\n* * * (al,l x + bl,l y + cl,l z)\n...\n\u03bb2 * (a2,1 x + b2,1 y + c2,1 z) * (a2,2 x + b2,2 y + c2,2 z)\n\u03bb1 * (a1,1 x + b1,1 y + c1,1 z)\n\u03bb0 .\n(3)\n\nThe decomposition is unique up to reordering and rescaling the linear factors within each term.\nNote: Corollary 2 does not require the polynomial P to\nbe either homogeneous or harmonic.\nProof of Corollary 2. Write P as a sum of homogeneous\nterms P = Pl +Pl\u22121 +* * *+P1 +P0 . First apply Theorem 1\nto the highest order term Pl , yielding a factorization \u03bbl *\n(al,1 x + bl,1 y + cl,1 z) * * * (al,l x + bl,l y + cl,l z) along with a\nremainder term Rl\u22122 of homogeneous degree l \u2212 2. (The\nfactor x2 + y 2 + z 2 may be ignored on the unit sphere.)\nFold Rl\u22122 in with Pl\u22122 , and proceed recursively, applying\nTheorem 1 to Pl\u22121 , then Pl\u22122 , and so on.\nTo prove uniqueness, consider the even and odd parts\nof P separately. That is, write P = Peven + Podd , where\nPeven contains all the even-powered terms and Podd contains all the odd-powered terms. Say we have two potentially different decompositions for the even part\nPeven = \u03a0l + \u03a0l\u22122 + \u03a0l\u22124 + * * * + \u03a00\n= \u03a0\u2032l + \u03a0\u2032l\u22122 + \u03a0\u2032l\u22124 + * * * + \u03a0\u20320 .\n\n(4)\n\nwhere each \u03a0i is the ith term in a decomposition (3), and\nwhere the leading index will be l or l \u2212 1 according to\nwhether l is even or odd. To make these decompositions\nhomogeneous, multiply through by appropriate powers of\nQ = x2 + y 2 + z 2 ,\nPeven = \u03a0l + Q\u03a0l\u22122 + Q2 \u03a0l\u22124 + * * * + Ql/2 \u03a00\n\n= \u03a0\u2032l + Q\u03a0\u2032l\u22122 + Q2 \u03a0\u2032l\u22124 + * * * + Ql/2 \u03a0\u20320 . (5)\n\nThis does not affect the value of P on the unit sphere,\nbecause Q = 1 there. The uniqueness part of Theorem 1\nimplies that the leading order terms \u03a0l and \u03a0\u2032l must be\nequal. So subtract off those leading terms, divide through\nby Q, and apply Theorem 1 again to conclude \u03a0l\u22122 =\n\u03a0\u2032l\u22122 . Continue recursively to finally reach \u03a00 = \u03a0\u20320 .\nThe same argument then proves that the odd part of P\nhas a unique decomposition as well. Q.E.D.\nII.\n\nPROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM\n\nEven though the statement of Theorem 1 lives wholly\nin the world of real polynomials, its proof will dive deeply\ninto the world of complex polynomials. So let the variables x, y and z range over the complex numbers, while\n\ninsisting that the coefficients of the polynomial P remain\nreal. Because P has homogeneous degree l, whenever one\npoint (x0 , y0 , z0 ) satisfies P (x, y, z) = 0, every nonzero\nconstant multiple (\u03b1x0 , \u03b1y0 , \u03b1z0 ) satisfies it as well. Thus\nthe equation P = 0 is well defined on each equivalence\nclass of points {\u03b1(x0 , y0 , z0 ) | \u03b1 \u2208 C \u2212 {0}}. In other\nwords, the complex curve P = 0 is well defined on the\ncomplex projective plane CP 2 , which is the quotient of\nC3 \u2212 {(0, 0, 0)} under the equivalence relation (x0 , y0 , z0 )\n\u223c \u03b1(x0 , y0 , z0 ). This leads us into the realm of algebraic\ngeometry and puts its powerful tools at our disposal.\nThe most useful tool for our purposes is\nB\u00e9zout's Theorem. If P and Q are homogeneous polynomials of degree m and n, respectively, then the curves\nP = 0 and Q = 0 intersect in CP 2\n\u2022 in exactly m * n points, counted with multiplicity, if\nP and Q share no common factor, or\n\u2022 in infinitely many points, if P and Q do share a\ncommon factor.\nFor an elementary exposition of B\u00e9zout's Theorem, see\n[6].\nIn the present case, the only way the polynomial P\nmay share a factor with the irreducible polynomial\nQ(x, y, z) \u2261 x2 + y 2 + z 2 is for P to contain Q as a factor, in which case Theorem 1 is trivially satisfied (take\n\u03bb = 0). So henceforth assume P does not contain Q as\na factor. B\u00e9zout's Theorem now tells us that the degree\nl complex curve P (x, y, z) = 0 intersects the quadratic\ncurve Q(x, y, z) = 0 in exactly 2l points, counted with\nmultiplicities. None of the intersection points may be\npurely real, because real values cannot possibly satisfy\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 = 0 \u2013 recall that the definition of CP 2 explicitly excludes (0, 0, 0). Furthermore, because P and\nQ both have real coefficients, whenever (x0 , y0 , z0 ) lies\nin the intersection P = Q = 0, its complex conjugate\n(x0 , y0 , z0 ) must lie there too. So the 2l points of intersection consist of l pairs of non-real complex conjugates\n{p1 , p1 , . . . , pl , pl }.\nWe claim that each pair {pi , pi } determines a unique\nline ai x + bi y + ci z = 0 with real coefficients. The proof\nis easy. The conjugate pair {pi , pi } lies on the line ai x +\nbi y + ci z = 0 if and only if the real and imaginary parts\nsatisfy the following two totally real equations\nai Re pi,x + bi Re pi,y + ci Re pi,z = 0\nai Im pi,x + bi Im pi,y + ci Im pi,z = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nGeometrically those two equations represent planes in\nR3 . If the coefficient vectors (Re pi,x , Re pi,y , Re pi,z ) and\n(Im pi,x , Im pi,y , Im pi,z ) are non-collinear, then the two\nplanes are distinct and their intersection, which defines\nthe solution set for (ai , bi , ci ), is a line through the origin\nin R3 . In other words, the line ai x + bi y + ci z = 0 is\nunique. Normalize the coefficients to unit length, i.e.\na2i + b2i + c2i = 1, and the only remaining ambiguity is an\noverall factor of \u00b11.\n\n\f3\nBut what if the coefficient vectors Re pi = (Re pi,x ,\nRe pi,y , Re pi,z ) and Im pi = (Im pi,x , Im pi,y , Im pi,z ) had\nbeen collinear? In this case the line ai x + bi y + ci z =\n0 would be ill-defined. Fortunately this case does not\narise. For if Im pi were proportional to Re pi , say Im pi =\n\u03b2 Re pi , then the point pi , as an element of CP 2 , could\n1\npi = Re pi ,\nbe rewritten as a scalar multiple pi \u223c 1+i\u03b2\nshowing that pi is totally real. In other words, pi would\nlie in RP 2 \u2282 CP 2 . In particular, pi would be its own\ncomplex conjugate, and we can hardly expect a single\npoint pi = pi to determine a unique line. Fortunately this\ncase cannot occur, because Q(x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 0\nadmits no real solutions.\nSo let Li denote the unique line ai x + bi y + ci z = 0\ncontaining the conjugate pair {pi , pi }. More precisely,\nlet Li = ai x + bi y + ci z be the unique (modulo rescaling)\nreal linear polynomial whose roots include both pi and\npi . The desired decomposition (2) becomes\nP = \u03bb L1 L2 * * * Ll + Q * R.\n\nP (q)\n.\nL1 (q)L2 (q) * * * Ll (q)\n\n(8)\n\nWrite a new polynomial\nF \u2261 P \u2212 \u03bbL1 L2 * * * Ll .\n\n(9)\n\nThis new polynomial F has degree l, yet has zeros at the\n2l+1 distinct points { q, p1 , p1 , . . . , pl , pl } \u2282 Q. In other\nwords, the complex curve F = 0 intersects the complex\ncurve Q = 0 at (at least) 2l + 1 distinct points. By\nB\u00e9zout's Theorem the polynomials F and Q must share\na common factor; because Q is irreducible the common\nfactor must perforce be Q itself. Thus we may factor F\nas\nF =Q*R\n\nF (q) = P (q\u0304) \u2212 \u03bbL1 (q\u0304)L2 (q\u0304) * * * Ll (q\u0304)\n\n(10)\n\nfor some remainder term R. Combining (9) and (10)\nyields the desired decomposition (7).\nLet us now prove that \u03bb is real. In light of the factorization (10), the polynomial F is clearly zero on the\nwhole complex curve Q = 0. In particular, for the point\nq chosen earlier,\nF (q) = F (q\u0304) = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nF (q\u0304) = P (q\u0304) \u2212 \u03bbL1 (q\u0304)L2 (q\u0304) * * * Ll (q\u0304).\n\n(12)\n\nOn the one hand\n\n(13)\n\nComparing (11), (12) and (13), and recalling that q was\nchosen to ensure Li (q) 6= 0, proves that \u03bb = \u03bb\u0304, in other\nwords, \u03bb is real.\nAn elementary argument then shows that for all real\nvalues of x, y and z, R(x, y, z) = R(x, y, z) = R(x, y, z),\nimplying that the coefficients of the polynomial R must\nall be real.\nThis completes the proof of the existence part of Theorem 1.\nLet us now prove that the decomposition ( 2) is unique.\nAssume we have two decompositions\nP (x, y, z) = \u03bb L1 L2 * * * Ll + Q * R\n= \u03bb\u2032 L\u20321 L\u20322 * * * L\u2032l + Q * R\u2032 .\n\n(7)\n\nTo prove that this equality holds, we again turn to\nB\u00e9zout's Theorem. First recall that the complex curve\nP = 0 intersects the complex curve Q = 0 in precisely\nthe 2l points {p1 , p1 , . . . , pl , pl }. By construction, the\nproduct curve L1 L2 * * * Ll = 0 also intersects Q = 0 in\nthose same 2l points, and by B\u00e9zout's Theorem there are\nno other points of intersection. Now pick any other point\nq \u2208 {Q = 0} and define \u03bb to be the ratio\n\u03bb=\n\nOn the other hand, because P and the Li all have real\ncoefficients,\n\n(14)\n\nOur goal is to show that each linear factor L\u2032i\u2032 in the\nsecond decomposition occurs as a factor Li in the first\ndecomposition as well, modulo a possible rescaling. A\ngiven line L\u2032i\u2032 = 0 intersects the quadratic Q = 0 in a\npair of conjugate points p and p\u0304. Because p and p\u0304 satisfy\nboth L\u2032i\u2032 = 0 and Q = 0, they satisfy P = 0 as well.\nTurning our attention to the first decomposition, because\np and p\u0304 satisfy both P = 0 and Q = 0, they satisfy\nL1 L2 * * * Ll = 0 as well. Hence p must satisfy one of the\nlines Li = 0, and because the line's coefficients are real,\np\u0304 must satisfy that same line. But we saw earlier that\na pair of conjugate points p and p\u0304 determines a unique\nline modulo normalization (recall the essentially unique\nsolution to Equations (6)). Therefore Li is a constant\nmultiple of L\u2032i\u2032 , and if the coefficients of each have been\nnormalized to length one, then Li = \u00b1L\u2032i\u2032 . This proves\nthe uniqueness of the factorization.\nIf we evaluate the two decompositions (14) on the complex curve Q = 0 we get\n\u03bb L1 L2 * * * Ll = \u03bb\u2032 L\u20321 L\u20322 * * * L\u2032l\n\n(15)\n\nproving that if the coefficients of the Li and the L\u2032i\u2032 are\nconsistently normalized, then \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 . It then follows\neasily that R = R\u2032 as well.\nThis completes the proof that the decomposition ( 2)\nis unique, thus completing the proof of Theorem 1.\nIII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe proof presented in Section II is almost constructive, but not quite. It relies on B\u00e9zout's Theorem for the\nexistence of the root pairs {p1 , p1 , . . . , pl , pl } but does not\nsay how to find them. This section fills the gap.\nThe key observation is that the quadratic curve Q =\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 = 0 is topologically a 2-sphere. More to the\npoint, it is a copy of the complex projective line CP 1 ,\n\n\f4\nwhich happens to be homeomorphic to the 2-sphere. Let\nus parameterize the curve Q = 0 as\n( i (u2 \u2212 v 2 ), \u22122i uv, u2 + v 2 )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere u and v are homogeneous coordinates in CP 1 .\nClearly the mapping (16) takes all points (u, v) \u2208 CP 1 to\nthe curve Q = 0, by construction. The question is, which\nof those points happen to satisfy the given polynomial P\nas well? Write\nP (x, y, z) = P ( i (u2 \u2212 v 2 ), \u22122i uv, u2 + v 2 )\n\n(17)\n\nto express P as a function on CP 1 .\nIf v 6= 0, then (u, v) and ( uv , 1) represent the same\npoint in CP 1 . If we define \u03b1 \u2261 uv then expression (17)\neffectively reduces to a polynomial in a single variable,\nP (x, y, z) = P ( i (\u03b12 \u2212 1), \u22122i \u03b1, \u03b12 + 1)\n\n(18)\n\nThe roots of this polynomial are the desired root pairs\n{p1 , p1 , . . . , pl , pl }.\nIf, on the other hand, v = 0, then (u, v) = (u, 0) \u223c\n(1, 0). Thus (u, v) = (1, 0) may represent an additional\nroot, which would not be found as a root of P (\u03b1) in (18).\nOnce we have found the parameters (u, v) for all 2l\nroots of P , the easiest way to group them into conjugate pairs is to observe that the parameterization (16)\nmaps \"antipodal points\" (u, v), (\u2212v\u0304, \u016b) \u2208 CP 1 to conjugate points (x, y, z), (x\u0304, \u0233, z\u0304) \u2208 CP 2 . In other words,\n(\u03b1, 1) and (\u22121, \u1fb1) \u223c (\u22121/\u1fb1, 1) map to a pair of conjugate points in CP 2 .\nIV.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nTo illustrate how the algorithm works in practice, let\nus apply Theorem 1 to several concrete examples.\nA.\n\nConsider the quadratic polynomial\n(19)\n\nFirst dismiss the special case (u, v) = (1, 0) by noting\nthat the parameterization (16) maps (u, v) = (1, 0) to\n(x, y, z) = (i, 0, 1) for which (19) gives P (i, 0, 1) = i 6= 0.\nNow consider the general case, for which Equation (18)\nbecomes\ni\u03b14 + 2(1 \u2212 i)\u03b13 \u2212 4\u03b12 \u2212 2(1 + i)\u03b1 \u2212 i = 0\n\n(20)\n\nwith roots\n\u221a\n\u03b11 = 1 + 2\n\u221a\n\u03b12 = 1 \u2212 2\n\u221a\n\u03b13 = i(1 + 2)\n\u221a\n\u03b14 = i(1 \u2212 2).\n\nSolving the line equations (6) converts the preceding two\npairs of conjugate points to the two lines\nq\nq\n1x+\n1y\n=0\nL1 =\n2\n2\nq\nq\n1y+\n1 z = 0,\nL2 =\n(23)\n2\n2\nq q\nwhich give us the two multipole vectors ( 12 , 12 , 0) and\nq q\n(0, 12 , 12 ).\n\nTo find the correct \u03bb, evaluate Equation (8) for, say,\nq = (1, i, 0), giving\n\u03bb=\n\nP (q)\n\u22121 + i\n= 1 i = 2.\nL1 (q)L2 (q)\n\u22122 + 2\n\n(24)\n\nOf course any other choice for q would have given the\nsame answer \u03bb = 2, just so we make sure q lies on\nthe curve Q(q) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 0 and exclude q \u2208\n{p1 , p1 , p2 , p2 }.\nWe may now write down the polynomial F from Equation 9, namely\nF = P \u2212 \u03bbL1 L2\n= (xy + yz + zx \u2212 x2 \u2212 z 2 )\nq\nq\nq\nq\n\u22122( 12 x + 12 y)( 12 y + 12 z)\n= \u2212x2 \u2212 y 2 \u2212 z 2 ,\n\n(25)\n\nand divide by Q = x2 + y 2 + z 2 to get the remainder term\nR = F/Q = \u22121. Thus the final decomposition promised\nby Theorem 1 becomes\n\nToy Quadrupole\n\nP (x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx \u2212 x2 \u2212 z 2 .\n\ncorresponding, respectively, to the four points of CP 2 ,\n\u221a\np1 = (1, \u22121, \u2212i 2)\n\u221a\np1 = (1, \u22121, +i 2)\n\u221a\np2 = (\u2212i 2, 1, \u22121)\n\u221a\np2 = (+i 2, 1, \u22121).\n(22)\n\n(21)\n\nxy + yz + zx \u2212 x2 \u2212 z 2\nq\nq\nq\nq\n= 2( 12 x + 12 y)( 12 y + 12 z)\n+\n\nB.\n\n(x2 + y 2 + z 2 )(\u22121).\n\n(26)\n\nToy Octopole\n\nThe cubic polynomial\nP (x, y, z) = x2 y + y 3\n\n(27)\n\nillustrates some non-generic behavior which may arise,\nnamely the possibilities of (a) a \"missing root\" and (b)\nmultiple roots. We will follow the same algorithm as in\nSection IV A, pointing out only the differences.\nThe first difference is that the special case (u, v) =\n(1, 0), corresponding to (x, y, z) = (i, 0, 1), is indeed a\n\n\f5\nroot of P in (27). So we record that root and proceed\nonward in search of the other roots.\n\nquadrupole,\n\nThe next difference we encounter is that the polynomial\n\nY2\u22122\n\n=\n\nY2\u22121 =\n5\n\n3\n\n2i\u03b1 + 4i\u03b1 + 2i\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(28)\nY2\n\nhas degree only 5, not degree 2l = 2*3 = 6 as one expects\nin the generic case. Happily, this polynomial's five roots\nsupplement the one exceptional root (i, 0, 1) we found in\nthe previous paragraph, to give the required total of six\nroots. In other words, the unexpectedly low degree of\nthe polynomial is intimately tied to the existence of the\nexceptional root (i, 0, 1).\nThe roots of (28) turn out to be {\u2212i, i, \u2212i, i, 0}. Unlike more generic polynomials, this one has multiple\nroots, implying a repeated factor in the product L1 L2 L3 .\nSpecifically, those five roots correspond to\np1\np1\np2\np2\np3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(+i, 1, 0)\n(\u2212i, 1, 0)\n(+i, 1, 0)\n(\u2212i, 1, 0)\n(\u2212i, 0, 1),\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n=\n=\nY2\n\n1\n\n=\n\nY2\n\n2\n\n=\n\nUsing the coefficients a2,m for the DQ-corrected Tegmark\nmap of the first-year WMAP quadrupole gives\n\nFollowing the same algorithm, as illustrated in Sections\nIV A and IV B, we get the polynomial\n(0.01847852 \u2212 i 0.00950698)\n\u2212(0.04604038 + i 0.02128027) \u03b1\n\u22120.04065752 \u03b12\n+(0.04604038 \u2212 i 0.02128027) \u03b13\n+(0.01847852 + i 0.00950698) \u03b14\n\n(35)\n\nleading to the lines\n\nFrom here the algorithm is routine.

Converting the standard spherical harmonics Ylm to polynomials in x, y and z is easy. For example, for the\n\nv\u0302 (2,2) = (118.87\u25e6, 25.13\u25e6)\n\n(37)\n\nin full agreement with those that CHS found using their\ntensor algorithm (Equation 3 of [3]).\nAn analogous computation for the octopole yields multipole vectors v\u0302 (3,1) , v\u0302 (3,2) and v\u0302 (3,3) , again in full agreement with those reported in Equation 3 of [3].\nV. HOW WELL DO THE WMAP\nQUADRUPOLE AND OCTOPOLE ALIGN?\n\nFollowing [3], we define the quadrupole plane normal\nvector\nw2,1,2 \u2261 v\u0302 (2,1) \u00d7 v\u0302 (2,2)\n\n(38)\n\n\f6\nand the three octopole plane normal vectors\nw3,1,2 \u2261 v\u0302 (3,1) \u00d7 v\u0302 (3,2)\nw3,2,3 \u2261 v\u0302 (3,2) \u00d7 v\u0302 (3,3)\nw3,3,1 \u2261 v\u0302 (3,3) \u00d7 v\u0302 (3,1) .\n\n(39)\n\nStill following [3], we judge the alignment of the\nquadrupole plane with the three octopole planes via the\ndot products\nA1 = |w2,1,2 * w3,2,3 |\nA2 = |w2,1,2 * w3,3,1 |\nA3 = |w2,1,2 * w3,1,2 |.\n\nVI.\n\n(40)\n\nFinally, in contrast to [3] (which in its preprint form contained some statistical flaws), we let the sum\nS = A1 + A2 + A3\n\nas well as completely independent computer code. This\neffectively rules out the possibility of error in computing\nthe 1-in-1000 estimate, forcing us to take that estimate\nquite seriously.\nWe should point out that our Monte Carlo simulations\nchose random quadrupoles and octopoles independently\nof each other, relative to spherically symmetric distributions on the spaces of all spherical harmonics of degree 2\nand 3, respectively. In other words, we used independent\nGaussian coefficients alm .\n\n(41)\n\nprovide a numerical measure of how well the quadrupole\nplane aligns with the octopole planes. For the DQcorrected Tegmark map, the sum evaluates to S0 = 2.395.\nTo judge how unusually large S0 is, we evaluated S for\n100000 random quadrupoles and octopoles, and found\nthat only 118 trials produced S > S0 . This 99.9% confidence level, while weaker than the incorrectly stated\nresults of [3], is completely consistent with Huterer and\nStarkman's revised statistical analysis [7].\nLike Schwarz, Starkman, Huterer and Copi, we find\nthis result astonishing. In particular we find it difficult\nto believe that the quadrupole and octopole align so well\nmerely by chance. Whether the alignment is imposed by\nthe global topology of a small finite universe, or whether\nit is due to some previously unknown solar system effect,\nor whether it is merely the result of an error in the collection and/or processing of the WMAP data, remains\nto be seen.\nIn the meantime, we emphasize that our simulations\nuse an entirely different algorithm from that of [3, 5]\n\n[1] C.

One would like to\ndecompose an arbitrary real-valued function f : S 2 \u2192 R,\nfor example the temperature\nfunction\u0011on the microwave\nP\u221e \u0010 Ql\nsky, as a sum f = l=0 \u03bbl i=1 Ll,i . In other words,\nthis approach would bypass the spherical harmonics entirely, and instead write the function f directly as the\nQ\nsum of totally factored polynomials \u03bbl li=1 Ll,i , one for\neach degree l.\nCorollary 2 almost makes such a factorization possible. For example, if we approximate the microwave sky\ntemperature by the sum of its first 837 multipoles, T =\nP837 Pl\nYlm , then Corollary 2 lets us re-express\nl=0\nm=\u2212l al,m\n\u0011\nP837 \u0010 Ql\nit as T = l=0 \u03bbl i=1 Ll,i . The question is, what\nhappens when we add in the 838th spherical\nQ838 harmonic?\nFor sure we will add an 838th term \u03bb838 i=1 L838,i to our\nfactored-polynomial decomposition. And almost surely\nthe 836th term will change significantly as it inherits the\nremainder R from the newly added 838th term. But what\nabout the lower order terms? Will the second, fourth and\nsixth terms remain stable? Or will they swing wildly every time we add a new high-order term to the series? In\nother words, is the decomposition stable?\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nmethod: limitations and implications, submitted to ApJ,\nastro-ph/0403098.\nC.J. Copi, D. Huterer and G.D.
