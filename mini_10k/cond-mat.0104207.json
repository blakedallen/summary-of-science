Introduction\nThe recently discovered superconductor MgB2 has received great attention, mainly because of its high transition temperature of approximately 39K. [1\u20136] This relatively high Tc\nvalue may not be too surprising since MgB2 involves some of the lightest elements in the\nperiodic table, thus implying a large Debye phonon frequency for this compound. Indeed,\ndata from thermodynamic measurements [2,3] suggest a Debye frequency \u0398D \u2248 750 K as\nwell as a significant isotope effect with \u03b1 = 0.26.\nMore surprisingly, a rather small zero-temperature energy gap \u22060 = 1.20kB Tc was deduced from measurements of the specific heat [3,4] and from the optical conductivity [5].\nPresently, we do not know of any other examples for such a small ratio \u22060 /kB Tc in conventional s-wave superconductors. This observation naturally suggests an anisotropic s-wave\norder parameter for this material, where the energy gap detected in the thermodynamic\nmeasurements is in fact the minimum of the superconducting gap function. An alternative\nexplanation has been suggested in terms of multi-band models. [7,8] In many respects the\nproposed phenomenological model with an anisotropic energy gap is similar to a multi-band\nmodel. In fact, the latter may be thought of as a discretized version of the former. More\nrecently, the upper critical critical field for a dense wire of MgB2 was inferred from the field\ndependence of the critical current. [6] From these measurements it was concluded that MgB2\nis an extreme type II superconductor with a Ginzburg-Landau parameter \u03ba \u2243 23.\nDrafting an effective model with an anisotropic s-wave order parameter for MgB2 , the\nfirst important question to address is the direction and the magnitude of the anisotropy\nover the approximately ellipsoidal Fermi surface. In the distantly related tetragonal systems\nYNi2 B2 C and LuNi2 B2 C, such an anisotropy has been shown to appear in the a-b planes.\n[9,10] On the other hand, MgB2 has a hexagonal crystal structure, and thus the anisotropy\nis most likely to occur along the c-direction similar to other hexagonal crystals, such as UPt3\n[11] and UPd2 Al3 [12], and tetragonal crystals, such as Sr2 RuO4 [13,14].\nWe therefore propose a BCS model for MgB2 with a superconducting order parameter\ngiven by\n2\n\n\f!\n\n1 + az 2\n.\n\u2206(k) = \u2206\n1+a\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the parameter a determines the anisotropy, z = cos \u03b8, and \u03b8 is the polar angle. For\nthe calculations outlined in this paper, we impose the experimentally observed gap ratio,\n\u2206min (T = 0)\n\u22060\n=\n= 1.20,\nkB Tc\n(1 + a)kB Tc\n\n(2)\n\nwhich in turn yields a \u2243 1. In the following, we will therefore explore the consequences of\nanisotropic s-wave superconductivity in MgB2 within the framework of weak-coupling BCS\ntheory, setting a = 1.\n2. Density of States\nIn Fig. 1(a) the anisotropic s-wave order parameter \u2206(k) = \u2206(1 + z 2 )/2, is plotted in\nmomentum space. This function is an ellipsoid with a minor axis of length \u2206/2 within the\na-b plane, and a major axis of length \u2206 along the c-direction. The smaller magnitude of the\ngap function within the a-b plane is consistent with the stronger in-plane Coulomb repulsion\nthat has been suggested in Ref. [15].\n\n2\n\nN(\u03c9)/N0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c9/\u2206\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1. (a) Anisotropic s-wave order parameter.

(c) Thermodynamic critical field for anisotropic (solid line) and isotropic (dashed line) s-wave superconductors.\nInset: deviation of these critical fields from a parabolic temperature dependence.\n\nFollowing the formalism by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer [16], we calculate the temperature dependence of the energy gap \u2206(T ), the entropy S(T ), the specific heat C(T ), and\nthe thermodynamic critical field Hc (T ) for the anisotropic s-wave superconductor.

As expected, the characteristic jump of the specific\nheat at Tc , \u2206C/CN = 1.18, is small compared with the value 1.43 for an isotropic swave superconductor. This is consistent with the experimental picture for MgB2 . [3,4]\nFurthermore, it is seen in Fig. 2(b) that the thermodynamic critical field is also reduced\nin the anisotropic case.

Superfluid densities of anisotropic and of isotropic s-wave superconductors.\n\nFinally, the superfluid density \u03c1s (T ) shown in Fig. 3 is found to be rather anisotropic.\nSimilar to the energy gap and the thermodynamic critical field, upon increasing the tem5\n\n\fperature its departure from its zero-temperature value is exponentially small in the lowtemperature regime. On the other hand, in the vicinity of Tc the superfluid density for the\nisotropic case is linear in temperature, whereas for the anisotropic case \u03c1s (T ) is observed to\nbe slightly concave along the c-direction and slightly convex in the a-b plane. Once single\ncrystals of MgB2 become available, this anisotropy in the superfluid density should serve as\na signature for the order parameter symmetry.\n4. Upper Critical Field\nRecent measurements of the upper critical field in sintered samples of MgB2 have reported\na somewhat unusual temperature dependence. [6,8] This is likely related to the apparent\nanisotropy of the superconducting order parameter, and should thus become even more\nevident in measurements of the upper critical field in single crystals. Therefore we consider\nhere the two cases of an external magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the crystal\nc-axis of MgB2 .\n0.8\n\nhc2(T)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n: anisotropic, c\u2212direction\n: anisotropic, a\u2212b\u2212direction\n: isotropic\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nT/Tc\nFIG. 4.

In Fig. 4, the solution of this integral\nequation normalized by its derivative at Tc , hc2 (T ) \u2261 Hc2(T )/(\u2212\u2202Hc2 (T )/\u2202T )|Tc , is plotted\nalong with the hc2 (T )-curves for the a-b-direction and for the isotropic case. In the limit\nT \u2192 0 we obtain hcc2 (0) \u2243 0.824 which is somewhat larger than the corresponding value for\nthe isotropic s-wave superconductor, hc2 (0) \u2243 0.728. In the opposite limit, T \u2192 Tc , hcc2 (T )\nexhibits a rather linear temperature dependence within the weak-coupling BCS model. This\nbehavior is also observed for the isotropic s-wave superconductor.\n(b) H k a\nFor the upper critical field within the a-b plane a mixing occurs of the zeroth and the\nsecond Landau levels, leading to [10,17]\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2206(k, r) \u223c \u2206 1 + C(a\u2020 )2 |0i,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere |0i is the Abrikosov state, a\u2020 is the raising operator, and C is the mixing coefficient\nbetween the Landau levels which has to be determined self-consistently along with the critical\nfield. This leads to a set of coupled integral equations,\n15 1\n3\ndu\n1\u2212\ndz (1 + sin2 \u03b8 + sin4 \u03b8)\nsinh u\n28 0\n8\n0\n\u0015\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n+ C\u03c1u sin \u03b8(1 + sin \u03b8) exp (\u2212\u03c1u (1 \u2212 z )) ,\n(10)\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n15 Z 1\ndu\n1\n1\nT\nC\u2212\ndz \u03c1u2 sin4 \u03b8(1 + sin2 \u03b8)\n=\n\u2212C ln\nTc\nsinh u\n28 0\n4\n2\n0\n\u0015\n\u0013\n3 4\n2\n2\n2 4\n4\n2\n2\n2\n+ C(1 + sin \u03b8 + sin \u03b8)(1 \u2212 4\u03c1u sin \u03b8 + 2\u03c1 u sin \u03b8) exp (\u2212\u03c1u (1 \u2212 z )) , (11)\n8\nT\n=\n\u2212 ln\nTc\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\nwhere again \u03c1 \u2261 (vF2 eHc2 (T ))/(2(2\u03c0T )2), and sin2 \u03b8 = 1 \u2212 z 2 . The numerical solution of\nthis set of equations is shown in Fig. 4. The mixing coefficient (not shown) is found to\ndecrease monotonously from 0.069 down to 0.062 as the temperature is increased. This\nimplies a relevant admixture of the second Landau level. In the zero-temperature limit,\nwe obtain hac2 (0) \u2243 0.664. By comparing hcc2 (0) with hac2 (0), we can thus conclude from the\nc\nmodel calculation that the critical field observed in sintered MgB2 represents Hc2\n(T ) because\nc\na\nc\na\nHc2\n(T ) > Hc2\n(T ) for all temperatures. We also note that Hc2\n(T ), Hc2\n(T ) \u226b Hc (T ) since for\n\n7\n\n\fsintered MgB2 wires the Ginzburg-Landau parameter was observed to be very large \u03ba \u2243 23.\n[6]\n5. Conclusions\nBased on presently available experimental data on MgB2 we have constructed a model\nof anisotropic s-wave superconductivity for this compound with \u2206min /\u2206max = 1/2. This\nsimple theory appears to account rather well for the thermodynamic properties [3,4], the\noptical measurements, [5] and for the upper critical field data [2,6,8] on sintered samples of\nMgB2 . Experiments on single crystal samples will clearly be important to further investigate\nthe applicability of this model.\nWe thank M. R. Norman, B. Normand, H. Won, and N. C.
