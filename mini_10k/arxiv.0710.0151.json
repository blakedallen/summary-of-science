Even if flavor physics faces\nan unsure future, all would acknowledge its remarkable recent progress via the observation of rare phenomena such as CP-violation in B-mesons or particleantiparticle mixing for Bs and D0 mesons. If new\nphysics is indeed observed, the continued exploration\nof rare observables could well be an asset in deciphering exotic LHC events.\nMy purpose in this talk is to describe two recent\ntheoretical contributions to D0 mixing [1, 2].[22] Both\nRef. [1] and Ref. [2] should be considered in the context of the recent HFAG values [3],\n\u0001\n\u2206MD\n\u22123\nxD \u2261\n= 8.4+3.2\n\u22123.4 * 10\n\u0393D\n\u2206\u0393D\nyD \u2261\n= (6.9 \u00b1 2.1) * 10\u22123 .\n(1)\n2\u0393D\nIn light of the Physical Review Letters criteria of 'observation' (> 5\u03c3) or 'evidence' (3\u03c3-to-5\u03c3), we see that\nthe above 2.4\u03c3 determination for xD amounts to a\n'measurement' (< 3\u03c3). As such, we all await improvments in sensitivity for charm mixing.\nThe observed signal is seen to occur at about the 1%\nlevel. Whether or not this is the magnitude expected\nfor the SM signal is a topic I will discuss shortly. At\nany rate, I wish to also consider the possibility of a\nNP component in D0 mixing amplitude,\nMmix = MSM + MNP .\n\n(2)\n\nThe relative phase between MSM and MNP is not\nknown. Thus, in our detailed study of various NP\ncontributions to xD in Ref. [2] we most often compared\nthe NP predictions to \u00b11\u03c3, \u00b12\u03c3 windows relative to\nthe central xD value of Eq. (1).\nA.\n\nOperator Product Expansion (OPE) and\nRenormalization Group\n\nAn important technical aspect of Refs. [1, 2] is the\nprocess of relating an amplitude at some NP scale\n\n\u03bc = M to one at, say, the charm scale \u03bc = mc . This\ntakes the form\nX\nCi (\u03bc) hf |Qi |ii(\u03bc) ,\n(3)\nhf |HN P |ii = G\ni=1\n\nwhere the prefactor G has the dimension of inversesquared mass, the Ci are dimensionless Wilson coefficients, and the Qi are the effective operators. At the\nleading order of dimension six, it turns out that there\nare eight four-quark operators,\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nQ6\nQ7\nQ8\n\n= (uL \u03b3\u03bc cL ) (uL \u03b3 \u03bc cL ) ,\n= (uL \u03b3\u03bc cL ) (uR \u03b3 \u03bc cR ) ,\n= (uL cR ) (uR cL ) ,\n= (uR cL ) (uR cL ) ,\n= (uR \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd cL ) (uR \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd cL ) ,\n= (uR \u03b3\u03bc cR ) (uR \u03b3 \u03bc cR ) ,\n= (uL cR ) (uL cR ) ,\n= (uL \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd cR ) (uL \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd cR ) .\n\n(4)\n\nAny given NP contribution will often involve several\nof these, but in all events never more than these eight.\nThe evolution is determined by solving the RG equations obeyed by the Wilson coefficients,\nd ~\n~\nC(\u03bc) = \u03b3\u0302 T C(\u03bc)\n,\nd log \u03bc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0302 is the 8 \u00d7 8 anomalous dimension matrix [4].\nThe output of this calculation is a set of RG factors ri (\u03bc, M ) which are expressed in terms of ratios\nof QCD fine structure constants evaluated at different\nscales, e.g. as with\nr1 (\u03bc, M ) =\n(6)\n\u00132/7 \u0012\n\u00136/23 \u0012\n\u00136/25\n\u0012\n\u03b1s (mt )\n\u03b1s (mb )\n\u03b1s (M )\n.\n\u03b1s (mt )\n\u03b1s (mb )\n\u03b1s (\u03bc)\nB.\n\nOperator Matrix Elements\n\nOne needs ultimately to evaluate the D0 -to-D\u03040 matrix elements of the eight operators {Qi }.

As a practical matter, the method used in\nRefs. [1, 2] is to introduce a 'modified vacuum saturation' (MVS), where all such matrix elements are\nwritten in terms of the known matrix elements of (VA)\u00d7(V-A) and (S-P)\u00d7(S+P) matrix elements BD and\n(S)\nBD [5],\n2 2 2\nf M BD ,\n3 D D\n1 2 2 (S)\n1\n,\nf M B\u0304\nhQ2 i = \u2212 fD2 MD2 BD \u2212\n2\nNc D D D\n1 2 2\n1\n(S)\nhQ3 i =\nf M BD + fD2 MD2 B\u0304D ,\n4Nc D D\n2\n2Nc \u2212 1 2 2 (S)\nhQ4 i = \u2212\nfD MD B\u0304D ,\n4Nc\n3 2 2 (S)\n,\nf M B\u0304\nhQ5 i =\nNc D D D\nhQ6 i = hQ1 i ,\nhQ7 i = hQ4 i ,\nhQ8 i = hQ5 i ,\nhQ1 i =\n\n(S)\n\n(S)\n\nMD2\n.\n(mc + mu )2\n\nq\u0304 \u2032\n0\n\nFIG. 1: Loop diagram for D0 \u2192 D .\n\nz \u2261 (ms /mc )2 \u2243 0.006 .\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nWith the above theoretical machinary in hand, we are\nnow ready to consider SM and NP contributions to D0\nmixing.\nII.\n\nD\u0304 0\n\nD0\n\nsin2 \u03b8c , itself seems to suggest that the experimental\nsignal (near the 0.01 level) is easily understood.

We see that the contributions of the\nindividual intermediate states in the mixing diagram\nare not intrinsically small \u2013 in fact, they begin to contribute at O(z 0 ). However, flavor cancellations remove all contributions through O(z 2 ) for \u2206\u0393D , so the\nnet result is O(z 3 ). Charm mixing clearly experiences\na remarkable GIM suppression!\nWe understand the reason for this. D0 mixing vanishes in the limit of exact SU(3) flavor symmtery. It\nis nonzero only because flavor SU(3) is broken, and\nindeed, D0 mixing occurs at second order in SU(3)\nbreaking [8]. A factor of z will accompany each order of SU(3) breaking and the rate difference yD will\nexperience an additional factor of z due to helicity\nsuppression.\n\nSTANDARD MODEL ANALYSIS\nTABLE I: Flavor cancellations in \u2206\u0393D .\n\nOne can use quarks or hadrons as the basic degrees\nof freedom in carrying out the SM analysis of D0 mixing. In principle, these should give the same result.\nHowever, as we shall see, rather different features appear in each description.\nA.\n\nQuark-level Analysis\n\nAt leading order in the SM, the OPE for D0 mixing consists of two dimension-six four-quark operators [7]. The next order contains fifteen dimensionnine six-quark operators. For each increasing order in\nthe OPE, there are still more local quark and gluon\noperators and the problem of determining operator\nmatrix elements becomes ever more severe. For this\nreason, the dimension six sector has received by far\nthe most attention.\nThe dimension six amplitude is depicted in Fig. 1.\nSince the b-quark is essentially decoupled due to the\ntiny Vub value, only the light d, s quarks propagate in\nthe loop. The Cabibbo dependence of this diagram,\n\nIntermediate State O(z 0 ) O(z 1 ) O(z 2 )\nss\n1/2 \u22123z 3z 2\ndd\n1/2\n0\n0\n\u22121\n3z \u22123z 2\nsd + ds\nTotal\n0\n0\n0\n\nOf course, this is just the leading order (LO) result\nin QCD, and we should consider the next-to-leading\norder result as well,\n(LO)\n\nxD = xD\nyD =\n\n(LO)\nyD\n\n(NLO)\n\n,\n\n(NLO)\nyD\n\n.\n\n+ xD\n+\n\n(10)\n\nThis has been done in Ref. [6] and the results are\nsummarized in Table II, which reveals that yD is\ngiven by yNLO to a reasonable approximation (due\nto the removal of helicity suppression by virtual gluons) whereas xD is greatly affected by destructive interference between xLO and xNLO . The net effect is\nto render yD and xD of similar small magnitudes, at\n\n\f3\n\nProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\n\nTABLE II: Results at dimension-six in the OPE.\nLO\n\nNLO\n\u22128\n\nLO + NLO\n\u22127\n\nyD \u2212(5.7 \u2192 9.5) * 10\n(3.9 \u2192 9.1) * 10\n\u2243 6 * 10\u22127\n\u22126\n\u22126\nxD \u2212(1.4 \u2192 2.4) * 10\n(1.7 \u2192 3.0) * 10\n\u2243 6 * 10\u22127\n\nleast through this order of analysis, as compared to\nthe experiment signal.\nIt is not inconceivable that the quark-level prediction of xD and yD just described might be considerably\naffected by a higher order in the OPE [9] which suffers\nless z suppression. Simple dimensional analysis [10]\nsuggests the magnitudes xD \u223c yD \u223c 10\u22123 might be\nachievable, although order-of-magnitude cancellations\nor enhancements are possible.\nB.\n\nare kinematically allowed. However, this cannot be\ntrue for four-pseudoscalars because decay into fourkaon states is kinematically forbidden. In Ref. [8] it\nis estimated that these 'kinematically-challenged' sectors can provide enough SU (3) violation to induce\nyD \u223c 10\u22122 . I personally find such an argument to\nbe an important advance in our understanding of the\nsubject. At the same time, it is unfortunately more\npersuasive than compelling due to the uncontrollable\nuncertainties inherent in this line of reasoning.\nTo summarize, we have just described how the observed D0 mixing signal could well arise from SM\nphysics, but the associated numerical prediction is\nseen to be lacking in precision. This conceivably leaves\nroom for some NP mechanism to co-contribute or even\ndominate the SM signal. In the following we consider\nin turn NP analyses of the width difference yD and\nthe mass difference xD .\n\nHadron-level Analysis\nIII.\n\nMost of the work involving the hadron degree-offreedom has been done on yD . One starts with the\nfollowing general expression for \u2206\u0393D ,\n1\nIm I\n(11)\nMD\nZ\nn\no\n|\u2206C|=1\n|\u2206C|=1\nI \u2261 hD\u03040 | i d4 x T Hw\n(x) Hw\n(0) |D0 i .\n\n\u2206\u0393D =\n\nTo utilize this relation, one inserts intermediate states\nbetween the |\u2206C| = 1 weak hamiltonian densities\n|\u2206C|=1\n. Although this can be done using either\nHw\nquark or hadron degrees of freedom, let us consider\nthe latter here. Clearly, some knowledge of the ma|\u2206C|=1\ntrix elements hn|Hw\n|D0 i is required.\nOne approach is to model |\u2206C| = 1 decays theoretically and fit the various model parameters to charm\ndecay data. Some time ago, \u2206\u0393D was determined in\nthis manner and the result yD \u2243 10\u22123 was found [11].\nThis value is smaller than the recent BaBar and Belle\ncentral values.\nAlternatively, one can arrange for charm decay\ndata to play a somewhat different role. The earliest work in this regard focussed on the P + P \u2212 =\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K + \u03c0 \u2212 states [12, 13]. In the\nflavor SU(3) limit, this subset of states gives zero contribution due to cancellations. But SU(3) breaking\nhad already been known to be significant in individual charm decays. Since the study of charm decays in\nthe 1980's lacked an abundance of data, these references could only conclude that 'yD might be large'.\nA modern version of this approach now exists, although the analysis takes an unexpected direction [8].\nSince SU(3) breaking occurs at second order in D0\nmixing, let us hypothesize that the contribution of the\nP + P \u2212 sector is in fact negligible due to flavor cancellations. Likewise for all other sectors whose decays\n\nNP AND THE WIDTH DIFFERENCE\n\nAt first glance, it would appear unlikely that NP\ncould affect yD because the particles contributing to\nthe loop amplitude of Fig. 1 must be on-shell. Since\nNP particles will be heavier than the charm mass,\n'there can be no NP contribution to yD '. Or so goes\nthe argument.\nHowever, as explained in Ref. [1], NP effects in\n|\u2206C|=1\nHw\ncan generally contribute to yD . In the loop\namplitude of Fig. 1, the NP contribution (empirically\nsmall for \u2206C = \u22121 processes) arises from either of\nthe two vertices.

In this section, I will give an overview of\nRef. [2], whose hallmark is the study of many (21 in\nall) NP models. Perhaps the best way to start is to\nconsider the different ways that 'extras' can be added\nto the SM:\n\u2022 Extra gauge bosons (LR models, etc)\n\u2022 Extra scalars (multi-Higgs models, etc)\n\u2022 Extra fermions (little Higgs models, etc)\n\u2022 Extra dimensions (universal extra dims., etc)\n\u2022 Extra global symmetries (SUSY, etc)\nAlthough this approach does not provide a totally\nclean partition of NP models (e.g. obviously SUSY\ncontains extra particles appearing in other categories),\nit proved useful to the authors of Ref. [2].\nThe broad menu of NP models which were analyzed\nis listed in Table IV. The extensive content of this list\n(e.g. there are four different SUSY realizations and\nthree involving large extra dimension) indicates how\nrich the field of NP models has become. Of course,\nthe subject of NP is by now fairly mature (in preparing this talk, I realized that my first paper on charged\nHiggs bosons [14] was written nearly 30 years ago!)\nand thus many models have been well exposed to the\nscrutiny of experiment. This would seem to imply\nthat parameter spaces for the various models have\nshrunk so much that a measurement like D0 mixing\n\nTABLE IV: NP models studied in Ref.

In fact, in giving this talk\nin several venues I challenged each audience to predict how many of the 21 models considered here were\nconstrained by the D0 mixing values or equivalently\nhow many evaded constraint. Before answering this\nquestion, we consider a specific NP example in some\ndetail.\nSuppose a vector-like quark of charge Q = +2/3 [15]\nis added to the SM. Recall that a vector-like quark\nis one whose electric charge is either Q = +2/3 or\nQ = \u22121/3 and which is an SU (2)L singlet. Both\nchoices of charge are actually well motivated, as such\nfermions appear explicitly in several NP models. For\nexample, weak isosinglets with Q = \u22121/3 appear in\nE6 GUTs [16, 17], with one for each of the three\ngenerations (D, S, and B). Weak isosinglets with\nQ = +2/3 occur in Little Higgs theories [18, 19] in\nwhich the Standard Model Higgs boson is a pseudoGoldstone boson, and the heavy iso-singlet T quark\ncancels the quadratic divergences generated by the\ntop quark in the mass of the Higgs boson. We restrict our attention here to the Q = +2/3 case. Since\nthe electroweak quantum number assignments are different than those for the SM fermions, flavor changing\nneutral current interactions will be generated in the\nleft-handed up-quark sector. Thus, there will also be\nFCNC couplings with the Z 0 boson [15]. These couplings contain a mixing parameter \u03bbuc which is con-\n\n\fProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\nu\u0016\n\n\u0016\n\nis just 4 of the 21 models, which came as a surprise to\nmany. These 4 models are Split SUSY, Universal Extra Dimensions, LR Symmetric and Flavor-conserving\nHiggs Doublet.\nIt is of interest to briefly consider a few of these, in\norder to understand how the D0 mixing constraints\ncan be evaded:\n\nZ0\n\u0015u\n\n\u0015\u0003u\nu\n\nFIG. 2: Tree-level contribution from Z 0 -exchange.\n\nstrained by the unitarity condition\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bbuc \u2261 \u2212 (Vud\nVcd + Vus\nVcs + Vub\nVcb ) .\n\n(15)\n\nA tree-level contribution to \u2206MD is thus generated\nfrom Z 0 -exchange (see Fig. 2). It is straightforward\nto calculate that\n(2/3)\n\nxD\n\nGF \u03bb2uc\n= \u221a\nr1 (mc , MZ )hD\u03040 | Q1 |D0 i\n2MD \u0393D\n2GF fD2 MD\n2\n\u221a\nBD (\u03bbuc ) r1 (mc , MZ ) (16)\n=\n3 2\u0393D\n\nwhere we have made use of Eq. (4) and Eq. (7). The\nresult is displayed in the graph of Fig. 3, which contrasts a \u00b11\u03c3 window (dashed lines) about the HFAG\n(2/3)\n(solid line),\ncentral value with the NP prediction xD\nas a function of the mixing parameter \u03bbuc . The bound\non \u03bbuc from D0 mixing turns out to be roughly two\norders of magnitude better than that from the CKM\nunitarity constraint.\nUpon performing analogous analyses for the other\nNP models, we arrive at a set of constraints (mainly\nin the form of graphs) like the one depicted in Fig. 3.\nIt is not possible here to summarize the results for\nall 21 models of Table IV. One must refer to Ref. [2]\nfor that. However, we can answer the question raised\nearlier about how many models avoid being meaningfully constrained by the D0 mixing data.

Split SUSY [20]: This is a relatively new variant of SUSY (2003-4) in which SUSY breaks at\na very large scale MS \u226b 1000 TeV. All scalars\nexcept the Higgs have mass M \u223c MS whereas\nfermions have the usual weak-scale mass. It\nis known that large D0 mixing in SUSY will\ninvolve squark amplitudes. But since squark\nmasses in Split SUSY are huge, the mixing becomes suppressed.\n2. Universal Extra Dimensions [21]: UED is a variant of the idea that TeV\u22121 -sized extra dimensions exist. There are no branes appearing in\nthis approach, so all SM fields reside in the bulk\nand just one extra dimension is usually considered. Each SM field will have an infinity of KK\nexcitations. It turns out that GIM cancellations\nsuppress all but a few b-quark KK terms, but\nthese are CKM inhibited.\nSo we see that supressions can arise from more than\none source and that the suppressing mechanism will\ndepend on the specific model.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAt long last, signals for xD and yD have been observed. These experimental findings, although greatly\nwelcome, whet our appetite for ever more precise determinations. Hopefully these will be forthcoming, so\nwe can put aside any lingering concerns that all the\nexcitement has been the result of statistical fluctuations.\nThe SM analysis, as is so often the case, is not without its difficulties. At the quark level, theoretical analysis in the dimension six sector through NLO gives\nxD \u223c yD \u2243 10\u22126 . These values are tiny compared to\nthe reported experimental signals. It is evident that\nthe triple sum over the operator dimension dn , the\nQCD coupling \u03b1s and the mass expansion parameter z of Eq. (9) is slowly convergent. This approach\nremains inconclusive at best.\nA more promising avenue is to study yD with the\nhadronic degree of freedom. This yields a plausible, and quite possibly correct, explanation for reaching the yD \u223c 0.01 level. Again, however, the effect of strong interaction uncertainties mars predictive\npower.\nFinally, the work of Refs. [1, 2] has explored which\nNP models can yield sizable values for xD , yD and\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\nwhich cannot. Charm mixing data has been found\nto infer useful constraints on NP parameters spaces,\nand as should be clear to all, provides a most welcome\naddition to the High Energy Physics community.\n\nence Foundation under Grant PHY\u20130555304.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author's contribution to the work described\nabove was supported in part by the U.S. National Sci-\n\n[1] E.
