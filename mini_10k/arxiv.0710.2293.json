Based on trends seen at lower energies we \"predict\" the multiplicities and\npseudorapidity distributions of particle density and elliptic flow that will be seen in\nPbPb and pp collisions at the LHC. We argue that, if these predictions turn out to\nbe correct, either these quantities are insensitive to the state of matter created in high\nenergy heavy ion collisions or the observed simplicity and universality of the data must\nbe telling us something profound about the mechanism of particle production, which\nto this date is not well understood.\n\nTwo of the striking features of multiparticle production is simplicity and universality. AA,\npA, pp and even e+ e\u2212 multiparticle production all exhibit trends, in particular energy and\npseudorapidity dependence, that are remarkably similar and simple, and that do not follow in\nany obvious way from theoretical models. I conclude from these facts that the currently\naccepted framework used in the interpretation of relativistic heavy ion phenomenology is\nmissing some key ingredient that is the root cause of this simplicity and universality.\nIn the not too distant future at the LHC, PbPb collisions will be studied at more than\n25 times the highest energies available today, and pp at more than seven times. If the trends\nseen to date continue at these higher energies, it will be more difficult than ever to dismiss\nthe trends as accidental or unimportant. It will become imperative that the origins of the\nsimplicity and universality of the data be identified. The reasons could be profound and give\nnew insight into our understanding of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and the state and\ninteractions of the matter created in such collisions.\nWith this in mind, in this lecture\u2217 , I summarize some important universal trends seen in\nAA, pA, pp and e+ e\u2212 charged particle production, integrated over all species and transverse\nmomenta, and then use the trends to extrapolate to LHC energies the lower energy data. Ie\nbased on the data to date I \"predict\" some of the early results that will be seen at the LHC.\nA key feature seen in the collision of all systems, be it e+ e\u2212 , pp, pA, or AA, is\nthat the dependence on energy of the pseudorapidity distributions does not seem to depend\nsignificantly on the nature of the incident systems, and the dependence on the incident systems\nof the pseudorapidity distributions does not seem to depend significantly on the energy of\nthe collision. For example, we find that in hadron-nucleus [1] and AA collisions [2] the total\ncharged particle multiplicity is proportional to the total number of participants Npart (wounded\nnucleons in the language of Bialas and Czy\u017c [3])with constant of proportionality independent\nof energy. Furthermore we find that in the case of AA collisions, per participant pair, the total\ncharged particle multiplicity is almost the same as in e+ e\u2212 collisions at the same center of mass\n\u221a\nenergy, sN N , per pair, and in the case of pA it is almost the same as in pp collisions [2]. As a\nresult the Npart dependence of the normalized total charged particle multiplicity produced in\n\u2217 A summary of the results presented here was given at the \"Workshop on predictions in HIC at the\nLHC\", CERN, June 2007. A more detailed version of this talk will be submitted for publication in\nActa. Phys. Polonica.\n\n\f2\nhadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions can be summarized by a single universal curve,\nas illustrated in fig. 1. It is remarkable that for such a variety of systems with Npart ranging\nfrom 2 to 350, and energy from at least 10 GeV to 100 GeV, the Npart dependence is the same.\nEqually surprising is the observation that for all colliding systems the total charged particle\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmultiplicity increases in a similar way, as ln2 sN N , with sN N in GeV.

It is a compilation\nof E178 and Phobos data, taken from ref 4.\n\nFigure 2 A compilation of data [5] which shows\nthat the total charged particle multiplicity in\ne+ e\u2212 , pp, pp\u0304, and AA collisions all scale with\n\u221a\n\u221a\nenergy as ln2 s, with s in GeV.\n\nExtrapolating the data shown in figs 1 and 2 to LHC energies, we \"predict\" the following\nfor collisions at the LHC:\n\u221a\nFor non-single-diffractive (NSD) pp at s=14 TeV, nch = 70 \u00b1 8\n\u221a\nFor non-single-diffractive (NSD) pp at s=5.5 TeV, nch = 57 \u00b1 7\n\u221a\nFor inelastic pp at s=14 TeV, nch = 60 \u00b1 10\n\u221a\nFor inelastic pp at s=5.5 TeV, nch = 49 \u00b1 8\n\u221a\nFor PbPb collisions with Npart =386 (top 3% centrality [6]) at sN N =5.5 TeV, nch =\n15000 \u00b1 1000\n\u221a\nIt turns out that the ln2 sN N dependence of the total multiplicity is a direct consequence\nof three interesting features of the particle density pseudorapidity distributions: an increase\n\u221a\nas ln sN N of the particle density at midrapidity, an almost trapezoidal shape of the\npseudorapidity distributions [2], and extended longitudinal scaling [7] (a.k.a. limiting\nfragmentation) that leads to a growth of the width of the distributions proportional to\n\u221a\n\u221a\nybeam (\u2248 ln sN N at high energies). An example of the ln sN N growth of the midrapidity\ndensity for central collisions of heavy ions is shown in fig. 3. Extended longitudinal scaling is\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3 Midrapidity particle density per participant pair for AA collisions. Data are from a\nPhobos compilation [2]. Extrapolating the data\n\u221a\nch\nto sN N = 5.5 TeV yields dN\nd\u03b7 = 1200 \u00b1 100 for\nNpart = 386 (top 3% centrality [6]).\n\nFigure 4 Examples of extended longitudinal\nscaling. pp and pp\u0304 data [8], figure from ref 4; e+ e\u2212\ndata [9], figure from ref 2.\n\nmost apparent if one plots the data in the rest frame of one of the colliding systems, as shown\nfor example in fig. 4 for pp and e+ e\u2212 collisions.\nUsing the observed energy dependence of the pseudorapidity distributions of the particle\ndensity described above, there are two mathematically equivalent ways in which we can\nextrapolate lower energy data to LHC energies. The first method is illustrated in fig. 5\nfor central PbPb collisions. By extrapolation of figs 1 and 2 to Npart =360 (top 10% centrality\n\u221a\n[6]) and sN N = 5.5 TeV we know approximately what will be the shape of the pseudorapidity\n\u221a\ndistribution and its integral. From the known ln sN N growth of the midrapidity density for\ncentral heavy ion collisions (fig. 3) we know what will be the level of the plateau. Finally we\ncan use lower energy data and extended longitudinal scaling (ie. plot the lower energy data\n\u221a\nfor central heavy ion collisions in the rest frame of the two colliding Pb nuclei at sN N = 5.5\nTeV) to determine the slope and position of the sides of the \"trapezoid\". All this information\nactually over constraints the \"predicted\" pseudorapidity distribution shown in fig. 5.\nThe second method uses the fact that the width and height of pseudorapidity distributions\n\u221a\ngrow as ln sN N , that the shape of the distributions is approximately trapezoidal and that\nthe particle density is essentially zero at beam rapidity. As a consequence, for given colliding\nsystems, the shape of the pseudorapidity distribution of the charged particle density is\n\u221a\nindependent of energy, and both the width and the height are proportional to ln sN N .\nTherefore any measurement of the distribution for some colliding systems at one energy can\nbe used to \"predict\" the result for the same colliding systems at any other energy . In fig.\n6 we use many data sets to \"predict\" LHC results for PbPb collisions with different impact\nparameter, and in figs 7 and 8 the same is repeated to predict pp and pA results respectively.\nIn the latter case, A is a hypothetical \"nuclear emulsion nucleus\" with effective Npart = 3.4.\nThe fact that the two methods, in fig. 5 and fig. 6, \"predict\" the same results and that in figs\n6, 7, and 8 different data sets lead to the same \"prediction\" is direct evidence of the universal\nnature of the various trends seen in the data and discussed above.

However the detailed shape of the rapidity distributions depends on the geometry of\nthe collision. It is yet another interesting fact that at all energies and for different nuclei the\nshape of the distributions is almost the same provided the impact parameter corresponds to\nNpart\nthe same fractional cross-section (or better still the same value of 2A\n[10]). In figs 9 and 10\nwe use these facts to \"predict\" for PbPb collisions at LHC the centrality dependents of the\nshape of the pseudorapidity distributions and the midrapidity particle density.\nNext, we briefly consider trends seen in the azimuthal distributions of particle density, or\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 9 Extrapolation of the shape of the\nparticle density distributions, seen in Phobos\n\u221a\nAuAu data [2], to PbPb collisions at sN N =5.5\nTeV for two centralities, 0-6% and 35-45%.

Once again we find that for the same\nfractional cross-section at all energies, for both AuAu and CuCu collisions, the shape of\nthe rapidity distributions of the v2 is the same, approximately triangular rather than the\ntrapezoidal shape seen in the case of particle density. Furthermore the energy dependence of\nthe distributions again exhibit extended longitudinal scaling. There is however one noticeable\ndifference, the value of v2 does not extrapolate to zero at beam rapidity. At all energies\nthe v2 distributions appear to be on top of a \"pedestal\". This may be an indication that the\nobserved values of v2 have an energy independent component, perhaps a non-flow contribution.\nWhatever the reason for the \"pedestal\", as a consequence, we cannot use the second method\nto \"predict\" the v2 distributions that will be seen at the LHC. However we can still use the\nfirst method.

See text.\n\n\f6\nSo far I have tried to point out the remarkable simplicity and universality of multiparticle\nproduction, exhibiting such clear trends that it is possible to extrapolate the data to LHC\nenergies with high precision. I now briefly discuss why I find this data so intriguing.\nIn our current understanding, the processes taking place during particle production in\ne+ e\u2212 is quite different from that in pp collisions, let alone in AA collisions. Even if we just\nconsider AA collisions, our understanding is that there is a qualitatively different intermediate\nstate produced in low and high energy AA collisions. In the former the intermediate state is\ndominated by fragments of the incident nuclei, by baryons. In the latter there is a relativistic\nhydrodynamic fluid of deconfined partons with extremely low viscosity. How is it then that\n\u221a\nfrom sN N below 10 GeV to above 200 GeV and for systems as diverse as e+ e\u2212 , pp, pA\nand AA there are no obvious qualitative differences in the trends exhibited by the global\nmultiparticle production data? Or consider the difference in the pseudorapidity distributions\nof the particle density for peripheral and central AA collisions. Per participant, the integral of\nthe distributions is the same in the two cases, but not the detailed shape. For central collisions\nthere are more particles produced at midrapidity while for peripheral collisions there are more\nat high rapidity: an apparent exchange, one for one, of slow particles and fast particles. What\nis it in the mechanism of the particle production process that leads to an apparent conservation\nof particle number? Surely these are not accidents! There must be some general underlying\nphysics, that to date is not well understood, that accounts for the observed simplicity and\nuniversality of the data. LHC data, whether it is consistent or not with the extrapolations\npresented here, should throw much light on this topic.\nAs a final note, it is important to point out that if it turns out that, there are general\nprinciples that do show that the global properties of particles produced in high energy collisions\nare insensitive to the intermediate state, it follows that we can learn nothing about the\nintermediate state from the study of the global properties of multiparticle production, and\nfurthermore that any successful theoretical model prediction of the global properties of the\ndata cannot be used as evidence that the model correctly describes the intermediate state.\n\n\f7\nI wish to acknowledge Alex Mott, Yen-Jie Lee, Andre Yoon, Richard Hollis and Rachid\nNoucier for help with the plots.
