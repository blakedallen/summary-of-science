In this paper the 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds are classified up to equivariant contactomorphisms. The construction of such manifolds with singular orbits requires\nthe use of generalized Dehn twists.\nWe show as an application that all simply connected 5-manifolds with singular orbits are\nrealized by a Brieskorn manifold with exponents (k, 2, 2, 2). The standard contact structure on\nsuch a manifold gives right-handed Dehn twists, and a second contact structure defined in the\narticle gives left-handed twists.\n\nA 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifold M can be decomposed into the set of singular orbits\nM(sing) and the set of regular orbits M(reg) . Both parts can be described relatively easily: The\ne 2 := R \u00d7 S2 / \u223c, where\nsingular orbits are the disjoint union of copies of S1 \u00d7 RP2 , S1 \u00d7 S2 or S1 \u00d7S\n(t, p) \u223c (t + 1, \u2212p). The set of regular orbits contains a canonical submanifold R of dimension 3\n(the so-called cross-section), and one has that M(reg) \u223c\n= SO(3) \u00d7S1 R.\nFor gluing the singular orbits onto the regular ones, there is an integer invariant that classifies\nall possibilities. This integer corresponds to the number of Dehn twists.\nAcknowledgments. This article contains most of the results of my Ph.D. thesis.

Notation\nThis section only fixes some notations about Lie groups and G-manifolds. In the article, G\ndenotes always a compact, connected Lie group, g is its Lie algebra and g\u2217 is the corresponding\ncoalgebra. The only G-operation considered on g\u2217 will be the coadjoint action. For the stabilizer\nof an element \u03bd \u2208 g\u2217 , we write G\u03bd .\nA G-equivariant map \u03a6 between G-manifolds M and N consists of a smooth map \u03a6M : M \u2192 N\nsuch that \u03a6M (gp) = g \u03a6M (p). As a short-hand, we will write G-diffeomorphism instead of Gequivariant diffeomorphism, G-contactomorphism instead of G-equivariant contactomorphism etc.\nLet N be a submanifold of a G-manifold M . The flow-out of N is defined as the set G * N .\nFor a G-manifold M , we denote the set of principal orbits by M(princ) , the set of singular orbits\nby M(sing) and the set of regular (i.e. non-singular) orbits by M(reg) . The conjugation class of a\nclosed subgroup H \u2264 G is written (H), and M(H) is the set of points p \u2208 M whose stabilizer\nStab(p) lies in the class (H). The normalizer N (H) of H is the subgroup {g \u2208 G|gHg \u22121 = H}.\nFor every element X \u2208 g, the infinitesimal generator of the action is the vector field\nd\nexp(tX)p.\nXM (p) := dt\nt=0\n1. Preliminaries\nAt any point p of a G-manifold, there exists a so-called slice Sp . This is a submanifold that is\ntransverse to the orbit Orb(p), invariant under the action of Stab(p), and satisfies the condition\nthat whenever g * q \u2208 Sp (with g \u2208 G and q \u2208 Sp ), then g \u2208 Stab(p). In particular for the coadjoint\naction on g\u2217 , there exists a unique maximal slice at any \u03bd \u2208 g\u2217 , which will be denoted by S\u03bd\u2217\n(see [DK00]).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\u2217\n\nExample 1. Consider the SO(3)-structure of so(3) given by the coadjoint action. The principal\norbits are 2-spheres lying concentrically around 0, and {0} is the only singular orbit in so(3)\u2217 .\n\u2217\nThe maximal slice of an element \u03bd \u2208 so(3) (\u03bd 6= 0) is R+ * \u03bd and the maximal slice at 0 is the\n\u2217\nwhole of so(3) .\nDefinition. A contact G-manifold (M, \u03b1) is a G-manifold with an invariant contact form \u03b1.1\nIn the rest of the article we will assume that all contactomorphisms preserve the coorientation of the contact structure, i.e. for a contactomorphism \u03a6 : (M, \u03b1) \u2192 (M \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) with \u03a6\u2217 \u03b1\u2032 = f \u03b1,\nthe function f has to be positive.\nDefinition. The moment map \u03bc : M \u2192 g\u2217 of a contact G-manifold (M, \u03b1) is given by\nh\u03bc(p)|Xi := \u03b1p (XM ) .\n\nDefinition. For a contact G-manifold (M, \u03b1) with moment map \u03bc : M \u2192 g\u2217 , the cross-section\nR at a point \u03bd \u2208 \u03bc(M ) is defined as\nR := \u03bc\u22121 (S\u03bd\u2217 ) .\n\nOne can find a symplectic version of the following theorem in [LMTW98], the contact version\nhas been described in [Wil02].\nTheorem 1 (cross-section theorem). Let (M, \u03b1) be a contact G-manifold with moment map \u03bcM :\nM \u2192 g\u2217 . Let \u03bd \u2208 g\u2217 be an element in the image of the moment map, and let S\u03bd\u2217 \u2286 g\u2217 be the\nunique maximal slice at \u03bd.\nThen:\n\u2217\n(1) The cross-section R := \u03bc\u22121\nM (S\u03bd ) is a contact G\u03bd -submanifold of M , where G\u03bd :=\nStab(\u03bd).\n(2) The G-action induces a G-diffeomorphism between the flow-out G * R \u2286 M and G \u00d7G\u03bd R.\nThe contact form \u03b1 on the flow-out can be reconstructed from the cross-section and the\nembedding \u03b9 : G\u03bd \u0592\u2192 G.\nRemark 1. Note that the action of G\u03bd on the cross-section is in general not effective (even if the\nG-action on M was).\nRemark 2. The theorem uses the embedding G\u03bd \u0592\u2192 G. If one considers a cross-section R as an\nabstract H-manifold with H \u223c\n= G\u03bd and one embeds H in two different ways into G (\u03b91 , \u03b92 : H \u0592\u2192\nG), then in general G \u00d7\u03b91 H R \u223c\n6 G \u00d7\u03b92 H R. In the case of SO(3)-manifolds however, the embedding\n=\nof S1 into SO(3) is unique up to conjugation, and no problem will arise at this point.\nIn the following corollary, the cross-section theorem will be applied to 5-dimensional contact\nSO(3)-manifolds.\nCorollary 2. Let (M, \u03b1) be a 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifold with moment map \u03bc : M \u2192\nso(3)\u2217 . The cross-section R is a 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifold without Legendrian orbits or\nfixed points.\nConversely, let (R, \u03b1) be a 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifold without Legendrian orbits, and\nfixed points. Then there is a 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifold M that has R as its crosssection.\nProof. The first part of the statement is a direct consequence of the cross-section theorem and\nExample 1. If R had Legendrian orbits or fixed points, then 0 would be contained in the image\n\u03bc(R).\nFor the second part, the manifold M is given by SO(3) \u00d7S1 R, with the standard SO(3)-action\non the left factor. The contact form on M is constructed by taking \u03b1 + \u03b1(ZR ) * Z \u2217 on {e} \u00d7S1 R,\nand moving it with the SO(3)-action to the rest of M . With Z \u2217 , we mean the dual of Z with\nrespect to the standard basis {X, Y, Z} of so(3).\n\u0003\n1If \u03be = ker \u03b1 is a G-invariant contact structure on M , then one can average \u03b1 over the G-action to obtain an\ninvariant contact form.\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\nLemma 3. Let (M, \u03b1) and (M \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) be 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds. An SO(3)-contactomorphism \u03a6 : M \u2192 M \u2032 induces an S1 -contactomorphism between the cross-sections R and R\u2032 .\nProof. The pull-back \u03a6\u2217 \u03b1\u2032 is equal to f \u03b1 with a positive function f : M \u2192 R. For the moment\nmaps, this gives \u03bc\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a6 = f * \u03bc. The restriction of \u03a6 to R is then an S1 -contactomorphism to\nR\u2032 .\n\u0003\nLemma 4. Let (M, \u03b1) and (M \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) be 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds, and let R and\nR\u2032 be their respective cross-sections. An S1 -contactomorphism \u03a6 : R \u2192 R\u2032 induces an SO(3)contactomorphism between the flow-outs SO(3) * R \u2282 M and SO(3) * R\u2032 \u2282 M \u2032 .\nProof. The map is given by\nSO(3) \u00d7S1 R \u2192 SO(3) \u00d7S1 R\u2032 ,\n\n[g, p] 7\u2192 [g, \u03a6(p)] .\n\nOne easily checks that these maps are well-defined, and respect the contact structures.\n\n\u0003\n\n2. 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds\nThe classification of closed symplectic 4-manifolds with a Hamiltonian SO(3)- or SU(2)-action\nwas given in [Igl91] and [Aud91]. In the rest of the article, a proof to the theorem below will given,\nwhich describes the classification of 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds.\nTheorem 5. The following list gives a complete set of invariants for cooriented 5-dimensional\nclosed contact SO(3)-manifold M , in the sense that there is an SO(3)-contactomorphism between\nany two manifolds with equal invariants, and there exists a manifold for every choice of invariants\nfrom the list.\n\u2022 The principal stabilizer is isomorphic to Zk for some k \u2208 N (including the trivial group,\nfor k = 1).\n\u2022 The closure R of the cross-section is a compact 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifold without\nany fixed points or special exceptional orbits. Each boundary component of R corresponds\nto a component of M(sing) . The orbits in the boundary are the only Legendrian orbits.\n\u2022 If M has singular orbits, then the principal stabilizer is either isomorphic to Z2 or trivial.\nIn the first case, all components of M(sing) are isomorphic to S1 \u00d7 RP2 . If the principal\nstabilizer is trivial, one has two different types of components in M(sing) , which are either\ne 2 := R \u00d7 S2 / \u223c with the equivalence (t, p) \u223c (t + 1, \u2212p). The\ncopies of S1 \u00d7 S2 or S1 \u00d7S\nDehn-Euler number n(R) is an integer, which describes how M(sing) is glued onto M(reg) .\nThis Dehn-Euler number satisfies certain arithmetic conditions described in the Definition\non page 10.\nRemark 3. Contact 3-dimensional S1 -manifolds have been classified in [KT91]. The cross-section\nR is thus determined by the following invariants:\n\u2022 If R is closed, it is determined solely by the genus of its orbit space B := R/S1 , the\nexceptional orbits, and the orbifold Euler number which cannot be zero.\n\u2022 If R is an open manifold, it is determined by the number of boundary components, the\ngenus of its orbit space B, and its exceptional orbits.\nLet (M, \u03b1) be a contact 5-manifold and let SO(3) act by contact transformations with moment\nmap \u03bc.\nLemma 6. The principal stabilizer of a contact SO(3)-manifold is isomorphic to Zk for some\nk \u2208 N (including the trivial group, for k = 1).\nProof. Since the moment map \u03bc corresponding to the action is equivariant, Stab(p) \u2264 \u03bc(Stab(p)).\nThe SO(3)-structure of so(3)\u2217 was given in Example 1, and it follows that \u03bc \u2261 0 if the principal\nstabilizer is not one of Zk or S1 . But \u03bc \u2261 0 means that the action is trivial, which in particular\ncontradicts effectiveness.\nIn fact, the circle S1 can also be excluded: Assume exp(tX) (for some X \u2208 so(3), X 6= 0)\nleaves p fixed, i.e. exp(tX) * p = p, then we have \u03bc(p) = \u03bc(exp(tX) * p) = Ad(exp(\u2212tX))\u2217 \u03bc(p)\n\n\f4\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\nand as a consequence ad(X)\u2217 \u03bc(p) = 0. Let now X, Y, Z \u2208 so(3) be a standard basis of the\nLie algebra. Then, h\u03bc(p)|Zi = h\u03bc(p)|[X, Y ]i = 0, h\u03bc(p)|Y i = \u2212h\u03bc(p)|[X, Z]i = 0 and obviously\nh\u03bc(p)|Xi = \u03b1(XM (p)) = 0, i.e. \u03bc(p) = 0.\nNot only does this show that S1 cannot be a principal stabilizer, it also proves that all singular\norbits lie in \u03bc\u22121 (0), and the cross-section has no fixed points.\n\u0003\nThe principal cross-section R = \u03bc\u22121 (R+ Z \u2217 ) is a contact 3-manifold with a Hamiltonian S1 action. The S1 -orbits are neither fixed points nor tangent to the contact structure. If 0 \u2208\n/ \u03bc(M )\nthe cross-section R is a closed subset of M , because R+ Z \u2217 \u2229 \u03bc(M ) is compact, and hence R is a\nclosed manifold and then M , as flow-out of R, is completely determined by R.\nLemma 7. Let (M, \u03b1) be a 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifold. Then M(sing) = \u03bc\u22121 (0).\nProof. The preimage \u03bc\u22121 (0) is the union of SO(3)-orbits tangent to ker \u03b1, i.e. a collection of\nisotropic submanifolds. But isotropic submanifolds of a 5-dimensional contact manifold have at\nmost dimension 2, and hence these orbits have to be singular. On the other hand, the proof of\nLemma 6 shows that all singular orbits lie in \u03bc\u22121 (0).\n\u0003\nFurthermore a stabilizer of an exceptional orbit is isomorphic to some Zm and these orbits lie\ndiscrete surrounded by principal orbits.\n2.1. Examples. In this section a few examples will be introduced that are continued later in the\narticle, while the theory is developed.\nExample 2. The standard contact sructure on the 5-sphere S5 \u2282 C3 is given at a point (z1 , z2 , z3 )\nby\n3\nX\n\u0001\nxj dyj \u2212 yj dxj ,\n\u03b1+ =\nj=1\n\nwith zj = xj + iyj . This contact form is invariant under the SO(3)-action induced by the standard\nmatrix representation.\nThe stabilizer of a point x + iy \u2208 S5 with x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ) is the intersection\nof the stabilizer of x and that of y. If x and y are linearly independent, we have Stab(x+iy) = {e}\nand Stab(x + iy) \u223c\n= S1 otherwise.\nFor any matrix A \u2208 so(3), the moment map is given by h\u03bc(x + iy)|Ai = 2xt Ay. The crosssection is then the set\nR = {x + iy \u2208 S5 |x1 y3 \u2212 y1 x3 = x2 y3 \u2212 y2 x3 = 0 and x1 y2 \u2212 y1 x2 > 0} .\n\nThe condition x1 y2 \u2212 y1 x2 > 0 implies that the other two equations, regarded as a linear system\nin (x3 , y3 ), have the unique solution (x3 , y3 ) = 0. Hence the cross-section is given by\nR = {(z1 , z2 , 0) \u2208 S5 |x1 y2 \u2212 y1 x2 > 0} .\n\nThe S1 -action on R is given by simultaneous rotations in the (x1 , x2 )- and (y1 , y2 )-plane. Its\norbit space R/S1 lies in a natural way in CP1 with the projection \u03c0 : R \u2192 R/S1 given by\n\u03c0(x1 + iy1 , x2 + iy2 , 0) = [x1 + ix2 : y1 + iy2 ]. Note that the equation x1 y2 \u2212 x2 y1 = 0 is welldefined in CP1 and its solutions are given by the standard embedding of RP1 . Hence R/S1 is\ndiffeomorphic to an open disc and R \u223c\n= D2<1 \u00d7 S1 .\nAnother SO(3)-invariant contact form on S5 can be given by\n\u03b1\u2212 = i\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nzj dz\u0304j \u2212 z\u0304j dzj\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 i (z12 + z22 + z32 ) d(z\u030412 + z\u030422 + z\u030432 ) \u2212 (z\u030412 + z\u030422 + z\u030432 ) d(z12 + z22 + z32 ) .\n\nNote that the first part of the form is identical to the standard form \u03b1+ . It is easy to check that\nthe second term does not give any contribution to the moment map, and hence \u03bc+ = \u03bc\u2212 . The\ncross-section for \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 are then of course also equal.\nThe example will be continued at the end of the next section.\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\nI would like to thank Otto van Koert for pointing out the following examples to me. As we\nwill see later, these are all the simply connected contact SO(3)-manifolds with singular orbits of\ndimension 5. A good reference is [HM68] and [LM76]. The open book decomposition of these\nexamples is closely related to the SO(3)-symmetry ([vKN]).\nExample 3. The Brieskorn manifolds Wk5 \u2282 C4 (with k \u2208 N0 ) are defined as the intersection of\nthe 7-sphere with the zero set of the polynomial f (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3\u221a\n) = z0k + z12 + z22 + z32 . To make\ncomputations easier, assume the radius of the 7-sphere to be 2. It is well-known that Wk5 is\ndiffeomorphic to S5 for k odd, and to S2 \u00d7 S3 for k even.\nLet SO(3) act linearly on C4 by leaving the first coordinate of (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) fixed and multiplying the last three coordinates with SO(3) in its real standard representation, i.e. A*(z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) :=\n(z0 , A * (z1 , z2 , z3 )). It is easy to check that this action restricts to Wk5 , because the polynomial f\ncan be written as z0k + kxk2 \u2212 kyk2 + 2ihx|yi with x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ). The only\nstabilizers that occur are {e} and S1 . A point lies on a principal orbit, if and only if x and y are\nlinearly independent.\nFinally the invariant 1-forms\n\u03b1k = (k + 1) * (x0 dy0 \u2212 y0 dx0 ) + 2\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n(xj dyj \u2212 yj dxj )\n\nand\n\u03b1\u2212k = \u2212(k + 1) * (x0 dy0 \u2212 y0 dx0 ) + 2\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n(xj dyj \u2212 yj dxj )\n\nare both of contact type on Wk5 .\nThe infinitesimal generators of the SO(3)-action do not have a z0 -component. Hence the moment maps \u03bck (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) for both \u03b1k and \u03b1\u2212k are equal. They are given by\nh\u03bck |Xi = 4(x3 y2 \u2212 x2 y3 ),\n\nh\u03bck |Y i = 4(x1 y3 \u2212 x3 y1 ), and h\u03bck |Zi = 4(x2 y1 \u2212 x1 y2 ) .\n\nIt can be seen with a similar computation as in Example 2 that the cross-section R is given by\nthe points (z0 , z1 , z2 , 0) \u2208 Wk5 with x2 y1 \u2212 x1 y2 > 0.\nThe map (z0 , z1 , z2 , 0) 7\u2192 z0 from R to the open unit disc is the projection of R onto its quotient\nspace (see [HM68]). The cross-section is S1 -diffeomorphic to D2<1 \u00d7 S1 .\nThe example will be continued at the end of the next section.\n2.2. Singular orbits. In this section, we will show that each component of M(sing) corresponds\nto one of three possible models.\nLemma 8. Let (M, \u03b1) be a 5-dimensional closed contact SO(3)-manifold. Recall from Lemma 6\nthat the principal stabilizer H is either trivial or isomorphic to Zk .\nIf H \u223c\n= Zk with k \u2265 3, then M has no singular orbits.\nIf H \u223c\n= Z2 , then any component of M(sing) has a neighborhood that is SO(3)-diffeomorphic to\na neighborhood of the zero-section in S1 \u00d7 T RP2 , with trivial action on the first part and natural\naction on the second one.\nIf H is trivial, any component of M(sing) has a neighborhood that is SO(3)-diffeomorphic to a\nneighborhood of the zero-section in the vertical bundle V Etriv or V Etwist , where Etriv is the trivial\nS2 -bundle over S1 and Etwist is the twisted S2 -bundle over S1 .\nIn all of these cases, there is up to SO(3)-contactomorphisms a unique invariant contact form\non sufficiently small neighborhoods of M(sing) .\nIn the rest of this section we will describe all possible cases, and show the claims of the lemma.\nOne of the conclusion will be that the closure of the cross-section of a 5-dimensional contact\nSO(3)-manifold M is a compact 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifold with boundary. The interior\npoints of R lie in regular SO(3)-orbits, while \u2202R lies in M(sing) . The S1 -orbits at the boundary\nare Legendrian.\n\n\f6\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\nLemma 9 (Equivariant Weinstein Theorem). Let Orb(p) \u0592\u2192 M be a Legendrian SO(3)-orbit.\nThen a neighborhood of Orb(p) is SO(3)-contactomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero-section in\n(R \u2295 T \u2217 Orb(p), dt + \u03bbcan ), where SO(3) acts by g * (t, v) = (t, g\u2217\u22121 v).\nProof. There is an SO(3)-invariant almost complex structure J on the contact structure \u03be = ker \u03b1\nsuch that\nTq Orb(p) \u2229 J * (Tq Orb(p)) = {0} for all q \u2208 Orb(p).\n\nThe trivial line bundle \u03b51 spanned by the Reeb vector field of \u03b1 is also SO(3)-invariant. This implies\nthat the normal bundle of T Orb(p) in M can be equivariantly identified with \u03b51 \u2295 T Orb(p) \u223c\n=\n\u03b51 \u2295 T \u2217 Orb(p). The contact form restricts to dt + c \u03bbcan on the zero-section, and rescaling the\nfibre gives the desired form dt + \u03bbcan . This allows us to apply [LW01, Theorem 5.2], which states\nthat there is a neighborhood of the orbit SO(3)-contactomorphic to the normal bundle.\n\u0003\nBy looking at the different stabilizers that can occur, it will be seen that all singular orbits are\neither isomorphic to S2 with stabilizer S1 or to RP2 with stabilizer O(2).\n2.2.1. Fixed points. The irreducible representations of SO(3) are all odd-dimensional. This implies\nthat 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds do not have fixed points by the following argument.\nThe vector space spanned by the Reeb field is a trivial submodule of Tp M , and the contact plane\n(\u03bep , Jp ) is a complex 2-dimensional SO(3)-module, which also has to be trivial. That means the\naction on Tp M is trivial, which contradicts effectiveness.\n2.2.2. Stabilizer O(2). The neighborhood of an orbit with stabilizer O(2) is SO(3)-equivariant to\nR \u00d7 T \u2217 Orb(p) with Orb(p) \u223c\n= RP2 . The stabilizer of any non-zero element in T \u2217 RP2 is isomorphic\nto Z2 , which is then the principal stabilizer.\nA connected component of M(O(2)) is an RP2 -bundle over S1 (the closure M(O(2)) is a closed\nsubmanifold, possibly containing points with larger stabilizer than O(2), but we proved that M\nhas no fixed points, and hence M(O(2)) = M(O(2)) ). The structure group of a (G/H)-bundle\nwith the standard G-action on the fibers are just the G-equivariant diffeomorphisms from G/H\nto itself. It is not very difficult to see that these are given by N (H)/H (see [Bre72]). In our\ncase N (O(2))/ O(2) = O(2)/ O(2) = {e}, and hence every component of M(O(2)) is of the form\nS1 \u00d7 RP2 . The neighborhood of such a component is SO(3)-diffeomorphic to S1 \u00d7 T \u2217 RP2 with the\nstandard SO(3)-action on the second part. A possible invariant contact form is given by dt + \u03bbcan ,\nwhere \u03bbcan is the canonical 1-form on T \u2217 RP2 .\nIn fact, the contact form above is the only one in a small neighborhood of the singular orbit\nup to SO(3)-contactomorphisms. This can be proved in a similar way as Lemma 9: After pulling\nback the form to S1 \u00d7 T \u2217 RP2 , one has \u03b1 = f (t) dt + r(t) \u03bbcan on the singular orbits. One can\ndivide by f (t) and then rescale the fibres to obtain the standard form dt + \u03bbcan , which allows us\nto use again the Theorem from [LW01].\nIn 2.3 and 2.4, it will be important to know how the cross-section looks like in a neighborhood\nof the singular orbits. We compute the cross-section close to M(O(2)) in a coordinate description.\nA chart of RP2 around [1 : 0 : 0] is given by R2 \u2192 RP2 , (q1 , q2 ) 7\u2192 [1 : q1 : q2 ], and the\nSO(3)-action is induced by the standard matrix representation. Let X, Y, Z be the standard basis\nof so(3), where each element generates the rotation around the corresponding axis of R3 . For Y ,\nfor example the action looks like\nexp(tY ) * [1 : q1 : q2 ] = [cos t + q2 sin t : q1 : q2 cos t \u2212 sin t]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq2 cos t \u2212 sin t\nq1\n:\n= 1:\ncos t + q2 sin t cos t + q2 sin t\nThe infinitesimal generators of the action are given in this chart by\nXRP2 ([1 : q1 : q2 ]) = q2 \u2202q1 \u2212 q1 \u2202q2 ,\n\nYRP2 ([1 : q1 : q2 ]) = \u2212q1 q2 \u2202q1 \u2212 (1 + q22 ) \u2202q2 ,\n\nZRP2 ([1 : q1 : q2 ]) = \u2212(1 + q12 ) \u2202q1 \u2212 q1 q2 \u2202q2 .\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nand the moment map is\nh\u03bc(t, q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 )|Xi = q2 p1 \u2212 q1 p2 ,\n\nh\u03bc(t, q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 )|Y i = \u2212q1 q2 p1 \u2212 (1 + q22 ) p2 ,\n\nh\u03bc(t, q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 )|Zi = \u2212(1 + q12 ) p1 \u2212 q1 q2 p2 .\n\nElements of \u03bc\u22121 (R+ Z \u2217 ) have p1 6= 0 or p2 6= 0, and for such elements q2 p1 \u2212 q1 p2 = 0 and\n\u2212q1 q2 p1 \u2212 (1 + q22 ) p2 = 0 hold. These two equations can be read as a linear system in p1 and\np2 , and there are only non-trivial solutions if the corresponding determinant vanishes, that is, if\n\u2212q2 (1 + q22 ) \u2212 q12 q2 = \u2212q2 (1 + q12 + q22 ) = 0. If this is the case, then q2 = 0, and from this it follows\nthat p2 = 0. The cross-section R consists of vectors in T RP2 tangent to RP1 , but pointing only\nin positive direction (with the embedding of RP1 in RP2 given by [a : b] 7\u2192 [a : b : 0]).\nThe restriction of the contact form on R is given in the chart above by dt + p1 dq1 . Hence \u03b1\nis of contact type even on the boundary of R, and the orbits of the S1 -action are Legendrian on\n\u2202R \u223c\n= S1 \u00d7 S1 .\nA collar neighborhood of \u2202R is of the form S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 with contact form dt + r d\u03c6 and\naction ei\u03b8 * (t, r, \u03c6) = (t, r, \u03c6 + 2\u03b8). The embedding of this neighborhood into M is given by\n\u0001\n(t, r, \u03c6) 7\u2192 t, [cos(\u03c6/2) : sin(\u03c6/2) : 0], \u2212r sin(\u03c6/2) \u22021 + r cos(\u03c6/2) \u22022 ,\nand the points (t, 0, 0) \u2208 \u2202R all have equal stabilizer in SO(3).\n\n2.2.3. Stabilizer S1 . The neighborhood of such an orbit is SO(3)-diffeomorphic to R \u00d7 T S2 with\ntrivial action on the first and standard action on the second component. The principal stabilizer is\ntrivial. A connected component of M(SO(2)) is a closed manifold, because no fixed points or points\nwith stabilizer O(2) do exist, and hence M(SO(2)) is diffeomorphic to an S2 -bundle over S1 . The\nstructure group of such a bundle is N (SO(2))/ SO(2) \u223c\n= Z2 , hence the only two S2 -bundles over\n1\nS are the trivial one Etriv and the twisted one Etwist . They can be described by the equivalence\nrelations (t, p) \u223c (t + 1, p) and (t, p) \u223c (t + 1, \u2212p) (with t \u2208 R and p \u2208 S2 ) respectively. A\nneighborhood of a component of M(sing) is diffeomorphic to the corresponding vertical bundle.\nThe SO(3)-action on the second component of R \u00d7 S2 is compatible with these identifications, and\none obtains an action on either vertical bundle V Etriv and V Etwist .\nA possible invariant contact form is given by dt + \u03bbcan on R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 , where T \u2217 S2 is identified\nwith T S2 via an invariant metric. This form descends to V Etriv and also to V Etwist , because the\nreflection in the construction of Etwist is induced by a diffeomorphism of S2 , and \u03bbcan on T \u2217 N\nremains invariant under maps induced by diffeomorphisms of the base space N .\nIn a small neighborhood of M(SO(2)) , every invariant contact form is SO(3)-contactomorphic to\ndt + \u03bbcan . The proof of this fact is completely analogous to the one for orbits with stabilizer O(2)\nabove, and will be omitted.\nNow we will describe how the cross-section looks like in a neighborhood of the singular orbits.\nThe moment map \u03bc is given in the neighborhood of a singular orbit by\nh\u03bc(t, q, p)|Xi = pt Xq\n\nwith (t, q, p) \u2208 R1 \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 \u2286 R1 \u00d7 R3 \u00d7 R3 and X \u2208 so(3) in its standard matrix representation.\nOne easily checks that the cross-section is the set of points (t, q, p) where q lies in the equator of\nthe sphere and p is a vector tangent to the equator at q, with all these vectors oriented the same\nway. The S1 -action on the cross-section is induced by rotations around the z-axis of the sphere.\nFor Etriv , a collar neighborhood of the boundary \u2202R can be given by S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 , while for\ncomponents of type Etwist , the form R \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 / \u223c with the equivalence relation (t, r, \u03c6) \u223c\n(t + 1, r, \u03c6 + \u03c0) will be used. The contact form is dt + r d\u03c6 in both cases, and the S1 -action is\nei\u03b8 * (t, r, \u03c6) = (t, r, \u03c6 + \u03b8). The embedding of R into the neighborhood of M(sing) is given by\n\u0001\n(t, r, \u03c6) 7\u2192 t; (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6, 0); r * (\u2212 sin \u03c6, cos \u03c6 0) .\nWith this embedding, the points (t, 0, 0) and (t, 0, \u03c0) in \u2202R all have equal stabilizer.\nThis concludes the description of all singular orbits, and the proof of Lemma 8.\n\n\f8\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\nFigure 1. On the left the cross-section around an exceptional orbit is displayed:\nIt consists of vectors at the equator pointing into positive direction. The picture\non the right displays a model more accessible to the imagination: The crosssection sits as a ring around the equator of the sphere. Vectors pointing into the\ncross-section are normal to the sphere.\n\nExample 2 (cont.). As described above, the singular orbits of S5 are composed of all points x + iy\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ) are linearly dependent. The singular orbits are 2spheres, and we have to decide whether the component of S5 (sing) is equal to Etriv or to Etwist .\nThis of course is independent of the contact structure. The only points invariant under rotations\naround the z3 -axis are (0, 0, ei\u03c6 ) with 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0. But since (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, \u22121) both lie in\nOrb(0, 0, 1), we have S5 (sing) \u223c\n= Etwist .\nExample 3 (cont.). Now we will determine the type of the singular orbits of Wk5 . This of course\ndoes not depend on the contact structure. As we said above, a point (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 Wk5 lies on\na singular orbit if and only if x is parallel to y, where x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ). In\nparticular,\b consider the points\n\u0001 that are invariant under rotations around the z1 -axis. They are\nki\ngiven by ei\u03c6 , \u00b1ie 2 \u03c6 , 0, 0 | 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 . For k odd, all points lie\n\u0001 on a single path, but for k\neven, there are two connected components. Hence, one obtains Wk5 (sing) \u223c\n= Etwist for k odd, and\n\u0001\n5\n\u223c\nW\n= Etriv for k even.\nk (sing)\n\nSo far all invariants found for (Wk5 , \u03b1\u00b1k ), and (Wk5\u2032 , \u03b1\u00b1k\u2032 ) are equal if k \u2261 k \u2032 mod 2. But at\nthe end of the next section, a last invariant will be computed that allows us to distinguish all of\nthe (Wk5 , \u03b1\u00b1k ).\n\n2.3. Equivalence between contact SO(3)-manifolds. In this section, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an SO(3)-equivariant contactomorphism \u03a6 : M \u2192 M \u2032 between\ntwo 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds (M, \u03b1) and (M \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) will be given.\nIf there are no singular orbits on M , then 0 \u2208\n/ \u03bc(M ) and the whole manifold is determined\naccording to Theorem 1 by its cross-section. Two contact 5-manifolds with an SO(3)-action\nwithout singular orbits are thus equivalent if and only if their cross-sections are. The possible\ncross-sections, being closed contact 3-manifold with S1 -actions, have been classified in [KT91].\nOn the other hand, if 0 \u2208 \u03bc(M ), then M = M(reg) \u222a M(sing) , but there are several ways to glue\nboth parts. The flow-out SO(3) * R \u223c\n= SO(3) \u00d7S1 R is determined by R, but for the whole of M\nthe problem is that p \u2208 \u2202R does not \"remember\" as point in the S1 -manifold R, which stabilizer\nStab(p) \u2264 SO(3) it had in M .\nThe solution lies in choosing an arbitrary point p0 \u2208 \u2202R and marking all other points p in\nthe boundary with Stab(p) = Stab(p0 ) \u2264 SO(3). The marked points form curves in \u2202R. If the\nboundary component corresponds to Etriv , these curves are given by two sections to the S1 -action\nthat are related to each other by a 180\u25e6-rotation. If the component corresponds to Etwist , the\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nmarked points lie on a single curve, which intersects each S1 -orbit twice. If the singular orbits\nhave stabilizer isomorphic to O(2), then the marked points form a single section.\nAnother way to describe the situation is the following: Gluing M(sing) onto M(reg) can be\nachieved by gluing R onto the cross-section in the neighborhood of M(sing) . This means that one\nhas to identify two tori. The generators of the homology in \u2202R are given by an S1 -orbit and a\nsection \u03c3 to the S1 -action in R. The generators of the homology of R \u2229 M(sing) can be described\nby an S1 -orbit, and by a curve of marked points as fixed above. The S1 -obits have to coincide\nin both parts, and the only freedom when gluing consists in choosing the relative position of the\nother two homology classes.\nLemma 10. Let (M, \u03b1) and (M \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) be two 5-dimensional contact SO(3)-manifolds with principal\ncross-sections (R, \u03b1) and (R\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ). Assume there is an S1 -contactomorphism \u03c8 between R and R\u2032\nthat maps the marked curves \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n in \u2202R onto the marked curves in \u2202R\u2032 , i.e. \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03b3i = \u03b3i\u2032 .\nThen there is an SO(3)-equivariant contactomorphism \u03a8 : M \u2192 M \u2032 .\nProof. Over the flow-out SO(3) * R and SO(3) * R\u2032 the claim holds. Hence if M(sing) = \u2205, then the\nstatement is true. The problem for \u2202R 6= \u2205 is that \u03c8 extends to an SO(3)-homeomorphism on M ,\nbut this map is in general not smooth at the singular orbits. Hence we will need to deform \u03c8 in\na neighborhood of \u2202R.\nChoose a component K of M(sing) . The image \u03c8(K) in M \u2032 (sing) is of the same type: If the\nprincipal stabilizer of R is isomorphic to Z2 , then every component in M(sing) and M \u2032 (sing) is\ndiffeomorphic to S1 \u00d7 RP2 , and if the principal stabilizer of R is trivial, then the two types of\ncomponent in M(sing) and M \u2032 (sing) can be distinguished by the curves of marked points.\nNow one can represent the neighborhood of K and \u03c8(K) by the standard models described at\nthe end of Section 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. The cross-section is either given by (R \u00d7 [0, c) \u00d7 S1 / \u223c, dt + r d\u03c6)\nfor Etwist or by (S1 \u00d7 [0, c) \u00d7 S1 , dt + r d\u03c6) for the other two types of singular orbits.\nThe map \u03c8 is S1 -equivariant, thus\n\u0001\n\u03c8(t, r, \u03c6) = T (t, r), R(t, r), \u03c6 + \u03a6(t, r) .\n\nFurthermore it rescales the form \u03b1 = dt + r d\u03c6 by a function f (t, r) > 0, i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202T\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202T\n\u2217\ndt + R d\u03c6 +\ndr .\n+R*\n+R*\nf (t, r) dt + rf (t, r) d\u03c6 = f \u03b1 = \u03c8 \u03b1 =\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\n\nThe consequences are R(t, r) = rf (t, r), \u2202t T (t, r) + rf (t, r) * \u2202t \u03a6(t, r) = f (t, r), and \u2202r T (t, r) +\nrf (t, r) * \u2202r \u03a6(t, r) = 0. The boundary is mapped onto the boundary, i.e. R(t, 0) = 0. We can\nassume T (0, 0) = 0 and \u03a6(0, 0) = 0. Also, all of the three cases Etriv , Etwist , and S1 \u00d7 RP2 lead to\n\u03a6(t, 0) = 0, because the \u03b3i are mapped onto the \u03b3i\u2032 .\nLet \u03c1\u03b5 : R+ \u2192 [0, 1] be the smooth map\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nfor r \u2264 \u03b5/2\n\uf8f20\nRr\n\u03b52\n\u03c1\u03b5 (r) = N (\u03b5) * \u03b5/2 exp 4(x\u2212\u03b5/2)(x\u2212\u03b5) dx for \u03b5/2 < r < \u03b5\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1\nfor r \u2265 \u03b5\nR\u03b5\n2\n\u03b5\nwith N (\u03b5) the reciprocal value of \u03b5/2 exp 4(x\u2212\u03b5/2)(x\u2212\u03b5)\ndx. The maximum of the derivative of this\n\u22124\nfunction is N (\u03b5) * exp(\u22124) = N (1)e /\u03b5. One can now replace the original map \u03c8 by\n\u0001\nb r, \u03c6) := T (t, r), R(t, r), \u03c6 + \u03c1\u03b5 (r) * \u03a6(t, r) .\n\u03c8(t,\n\nIt is easy to check that \u03c8b is well-defined on the cross-section R: The relations \u03c8(t+2\u03c0a, r, \u03c6+2\u03c0b) =\nb\n\u03c8(t, r, \u03c6) + (2\u03c0a, 0, 2\u03c0b) carry over to \u03c8.\n\u0001\nb\nThe map \u03c8 is equal to T (t, r), rf (t, r), \u03c6 for points with r \u2264 \u03b5/2 and equal to \u03c8 for points with\nr \u2265 \u03b5. It is also an S1 -diffeomorphism. The determinant of the differential d\u03c8b is equal to the one\nof d\u03c8. The injectivity and surjectivity follow easily from the same properties of \u03c8. For example to\nb use that there is a (t, r, \u03c6) with \u03c8(t, r, \u03c6) = (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ).\nshow that (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) lies in the image of \u03c8,\n\u0001\nb\nThen \u03c8 t, r, \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5 (r)) * \u03a6(t, r) = (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ).\n\n\f10\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\nb Away from the singular orbits,\nb on M extending \u03c8.\nThere is now an SO(3)-diffeomorphism \u03a8\nb\nthe map \u03a8 is given as in the proof of Lemma 4.

These maps clearly define\nS1 \u00d7 RP2 the map is given by the projectivization of \u03a8\nSO(3)-equivariant diffeomorphisms in the neighborhood of a singular orbit, but one still needs to\ncheck that this definition is compatible with the map given in the proof of Lemma 4. Because\nboth maps are SO(3)-equivariant, it is enough to check that these maps agree on the cross-section\nb This shows that \u03a8\nb restricted to R gives back the map \u03c8.\nb is a globally defined map.\nR.

All of the SO(3)-invariant 1-forms in the family \u03b1s := (1 \u2212 s) \u03b1 + s \u03a8\nsatisfy the contact condition. This can easily be checked in a small neighborhood of the singular\norbits by using the local form given above. On M(princ) , one checks the contact condition along\nR (by choosing \u03b5 small enough) and then uses SO(3)-invariance. The equivariant Gray stability\nb deforms to an SO(3)-contactomorphism \u03a8.\nshows that \u03a8\n\u0003\nOf course, the next question is how to find maps with the properties required in Lemma 10.\nFor this, we need to define a last invariant for the cross-section.\nLet R be a compact oriented 3-dimensional S1 -manifold with non-empty boundary. Denote the\ncomponents of \u2202R by \u2202Rj (j = 1, . . . , N ) and assume that on each of the boundary components a\nsmooth closed curve \u03b3j is given that intersects the S1 -orbits transversely. Orient the curves in such\na way that \u03b3\u0307j followed by the inifinitesimal generator ZR of the S1 -action gives the orientation of\n\u2202Rj .\nThe \u03b3j should be of the same form as the marked points described above, i.e. if the principal\nstabilizer is isomorphic to Z2 , assume \u03b3j intersects each S1 -orbit in \u2202Rj exactly once. If the\nprincipal stabilizer of R is trivial, the curves are either sections or intersect each orbit twice.\nOn the boundary of a small tubular neighborhood of the exceptional orbits one can define\nstandard sections ([Orl72]), which can be extended to a global section \u03c3 of R \u2192 R/S1 . Let \u03c3\nbe oriented in such a way that the tangent space to the image of \u03c3 followed the generator of the\nS1 -action gives the positive orientation of R.\n\nDefinition. Denote the intersection number of two oriented loops \u03b1 and \u03b2 in an oriented torus by\n\u03b9(\u03b1, \u03b2). If the principal stabilizer in R is trivial define the Dehn-Euler-number n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) \u2208\nZ by\nn(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) := 2\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c3) +\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c3) ,\n\nj=m+1\n\nj=0\n\nwhere we assume the first m curves to be sections to the S1 -action, and the other curves to intersect\neach orbit twice. Note that the first term is a sum over even numbers and the second term is a\nsum over odd numbers.\nIf the principal stabilizer is isomorphic to Z2 define the Dehn-Euler number by\nn(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) :=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c3) .\n\nj=1\n\nIn this case n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) can be any integer.\nThe Dehn-Euler number is very similar to the Euler invariant for an S1 -manifold. To see that\nn(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) is independent of the section chosen, assume two different sections \u03c31 and \u03c32\n(that are homotopic to the standard sections around the exceptional orbits) are given.\nThere is a function f : R/S1 \u2192 S1 , such that \u03c32 (p) = \u03c31 (p) * f (p). The rotation\nP number\nrot( f |\u2202Rj )\nrot( f |\u2202Rj ) is defined as the degree of the map f |\u2202Rj : \u2202Rj /S1 \u223c\n= S1 \u2192 S1 . The sum\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\nover all boundary components of R vanishes, because the degree of a map D2 \u2192 S1 vanishes on\n\u2202D2 . We can cut R/S1 open to obtain a disc, and the extra contributions from the cuts cancel out.\nWith the equations \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c32 ) \u2212 \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c31 ) = rot( f |\u2202Rj ) for j \u2264 k, and \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c32 ) \u2212 \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c31 ) =\n2 rot( f |\u2202Rj ) for k < j \u2264 N , it follows that\n2\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\n(\u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c31 ) \u2212 \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c32 )) +\n\nN\nX\n\nj=k+1\n\n(\u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c31 ) \u2212 \u03b9(\u03b3j , \u2202\u03c32 ))\n=2\n\nk\nX\ni=0\n\nrot(f |\u2202Ri ) +\n\nN\nX\n\n2 rot(f\n\n\u2202Rj\n\n)=0\n\nj=k+1\n\nNote also that the orientation of the S1 -action has no effect on n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ). To compute n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) we can use again the section \u03c3, because the standard sections around the\nexceptional orbits do not change with the orientation of the S1 -action. The direction of the boundary curves \u03b3j and the orientation of \u03c3 are inverted. But then the intersection number remains\nunchanged.\nRemark 4. In Lemma 4, it was shown that the cross-section R (as contact S1 -manifold) is an\ninvariant of a 5-dimensional contact manifold M . It has just been proved that the number\nn(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3m ) is also an invariant of M , because under an SO(3)-contactomorphism the marked\ncurves are mapped onto each other. Below we will now finish the proof that a manifold M is completely determined by the invariants mentioned in Theorem 5 (i.e. cross-section, singular orbits\nand n(R)).\nThe 3-manifolds in the following lemma are cross-sections of 5-manifolds.\nLemma 11. Let (R, \u03b1) and (R\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) be two S1 -diffeomorphic 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifolds\nwithout fixed points, but both with N boundary components. Let the orbits in the boundary be the\nonly ones that are Legendrian. Assume further that on each of the boundary components \u2202Rj and\n\u2202Ri\u2032 curves \u03b3j and \u03b3i\u2032 are specified such that for both manifolds the first k curves (k \u2264 N ) are\nsections to the S1 -action and the other curves intersect each orbit exactly twice. Then there is\nan S1 -contactomorphism \u03a6 : R \u2192 R\u2032 such that \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03b3j = \u03b3j\u2032 , if and only if n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) =\n\u2032\nn(R\u2032 , \u03b31\u2032 , . . . , \u03b3N\n).\nProof. The basic strategy is to find diffeomorphic sections with certain properties in R and R\u2032 .\nWith these sections one can construct an S1 -diffeomorphism between the 3-manifolds that maps\nthe boundary curves in R onto the ones in R\u2032 . Afterwards this map is deformed to obtain a\ncontactomorphism.\nBy [KT91], the contact form around an exceptional orbits is locally unique up to S1 -contactomorphisms. Thus one can start the construction of \u03a6 by taking an S1 -contactomorphism from\na small neighborhood of the exceptional orbits in R to a neighborhood of the orbits of the same\ntype in R\u2032 . Choose also, for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , N \u2212 1}, an S1 -diffeomorphism from a neighborhood\nof \u2202Rj to a neighborhood of \u2202Rj\u2032 that maps \u03b3j onto \u03b3j\u2032 .\nThe standard sections to the S1 -action around the exceptional orbits extend to a global section\n\u03c3 on R(princ) . In R\u2032 , construct a section in the following way: Take \u03c3 in the neighborhood of the\nexceptional orbits and in the neighborhood of \u2202Rj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N \u2212 1 and map it with \u03a6 to R\u2032 .\nNow extend the image of \u03c3 to a global section \u03c3 \u2032 on R\u2032 (princ) .\n\u2032\nBy the assumptions of the lemma, we know that n(R, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) = n(R\u2032 , \u03b31\u2032 , . . . , \u03b3N\n), and by\n\u2032\n\u2032\nour construction \u03b9(\u03c3, \u03b3j ) = \u03b9(\u03c3 , \u03b3j ) for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N \u2212 1. It follows that the intersection numbers\n\u2032\n) are also equal. Hence one can homotope \u03c3 \u2032 in such a way that its position\n\u03b9(\u03c3, \u03b3N ) and \u03b9(\u03c3 \u2032 , \u03b3N\n\u2032\nwith respect to \u03b3N is the same as the one of \u03c3 with respect to \u03b3N .\nOne can map \u03c3 onto \u03c3 \u2032 and by using the S1 -action, we obtain an S1 -diffeomorphism \u03a6 : R \u2192 R\u2032 ,\nsuch that \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03b3j = \u03b3j\u2032 for all j = 1, . . . , N .\nTo transform the map above into a contactomorphism we need to sharpen an argument given\nin [Lut77] and [KT91] to avoid moving the curves on the boundaries. The neighborhoods of\nthe boundaries are of the form S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b4) \u00d7 S1 with coordinates (t, r, \u03c6), and the circle action\n\n\f12\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\non the last coordinate. Assume one contact form to be \u03b1 = dt + r d\u03c6 and the other one \u03b1\u2032 =\ng(t, r) dt + h(t, r) dr + f (t, r) d\u03c6. The orbits in the boundary are Legendrian, hence f (t, 0) = 0\nand \u2202t f (t, 0) = 0. Thus the contact condition along such an orbit becomes g(t, 0) 6= 0, and we can\ndivide the whole form by the function g to obtain the equivalent form dt + h(t, r) dr + f (t, r) d\u03c6\n(with new functions f and h).\nDefine now a map \u03a8 : R \u2192 R by\n(t, r, \u03c6) 7\u2192 (t \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5 (r))rh(t, 0), r, \u03c6)\n\nfor points with r < \u03b5 and the identity otherwise. Here \u03c1\u03b5 is the map defined in the proof of\nLemma 10.\nThe map \u03a8 is an S1 -diffeomorphism. It is surjective, because it is the identity on the two\ntori S1 \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 S1 and S1 \u00d7 {\u03b5} \u00d7 S1 . The map is a local diffeomorphism because det(d\u03a8) =\n1 \u2212 r(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5 (r)) \u2202t h(t, 0) does not vanish, if we choose \u03b5 small enough. Injectivity relies on a\nsimilar argument: If \u03a8(t, r, \u03c6) = \u03a8(t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ), then clearly \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 and r = r\u2032 . Finally t \u2212 t\u2032 =\nr(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5 (r)) (h(t, 0) \u2212 h(t\u2032 , 0)). With the mean value theorem one sees that if t 6= t\u2032 , one has\n1 = r(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5 (r)) \u2202t h(t\u0302, 0) with t\u0302 \u2208 (t, t\u2032 ), which is not possible if \u03b5 is chosen small enough.\nFor r = 0 the forms \u03b1 and \u03a8\u2217 \u03b1\u2032 are equal, hence the linear interpolation \u03b1s = (1 \u2212 s) \u03b1 + s \u03a8\u2217\u03b1\u2032\nconsists of S1 -invariant contact forms. To apply the Moser trick one considers the vector field Xs\nthat is the solution to the equations\n\u03b9Xs \u03b1s\n\nand\n\n\u03b9Xs d\u03b1s = \u03bbs \u03b1s \u2212 \u03b1\u0307s ,\n\nwith the function \u03bbs := \u03b9Ys \u03b1\u0307s , where Ys is the Reeb field of the contact form \u03b1s . The solution\nXs vanishes on \u2202R, and Xs has a global flow in a small neighborhood of the boundary. Hence\none has constructed an S1 -diffeomorphism between R and R\u2032 that maps the boundary curves onto\neach other, and respects the contact forms close to the boundaries and in the neighborhood of the\nexceptional orbits.\nThe proof is now finished by applying the Moser trick a second time, but now in the interior\nof the manifold. The vector field generates a global isotopy, because the two contact forms are\nidentical close to the boundary components, and the vector field has compact support.\n\u0003\nExample 2 (cont.). The Dehn-Euler number n(R, \u03b3) is the last invariant that needs to be computed\nto find (S5 , \u03b1\u00b1 ) in the classification scheme. The path \u03b3 can be taken to be (ei\u03c6 , 0, 0) with\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0, and a section in R = {(z1 , z2 , 0) \u2208 S5 |x1 y2 > x2 y1 } can be found by\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c3 : {z \u2208 C| Im z > 0} \u0592\u2192 R \u2282 S5 , z 7\u2192 q\n1 + z, z \u2212 1, 0 .\n2\n2 + 2|z|\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe boundary of \u03c3 is composed of two segments 1/ 2*(ei\u03c6 , ei\u03c6 , 0) with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and 1/ 2 + 2x2 *\n(x + 1, x \u2212 1, 0) with x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). The boundary can be smoothed at the points where the two\ncomponents meet, but this has no effect on the intersection number, because the only intersection\npoint of \u2202\u03c3 and \u03b3 is given by (1, 0, 0), and hence n(R, \u03b3) = \u00b11. The cross-section R has opposite\norientations for \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 , thus n+ (R, \u03b3) = 1 and n\u2212 (R, \u03b3) = \u22121.\nThe complete set of invariants for (S5 , \u03b1\u00b1 ) is: The principal stabilizer is trivial, S5 (sing) has a\nsingle component that is isomorphic to Etwist , the cross-section is D2<1 \u00d7 S1 , and the Dehn-Euler\nnumber n(R) equals \u00b11.\nExample 3 (cont.). Above,\nwe already saw that the cross-section of any Wk5 is S1 -diffeomorphic\n\u0001\n2\n1\n5\nto D<1 \u00d7 S and Wk (sing) is isomorphic to Etriv for k even and Etwist for k odd.\nNow, we will compute n(R, \u03b3) for (Wk5 , \u03b1k ) and (Wk5 , \u03b1\u2212k ). The curve \u03b3(\u03c6) is given by\nk\ni\u03c6\n\u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] for k even and with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0] for k odd.\n(e , +ie 2 i\u03c6 , 0, 0) with \u03c6 q\np\nSet r0 = |z0 | and A = 2 \u2212 r02 + (2 \u2212 r02 )2 \u2212 r02k . The map below is a section of R\n\u0013\n\u0012\niA\nz0k\nA\niz0k\n2\n\u03c3 : D \u0592\u2192 R, z0 7\u2192 z0 ,\n+\n,\u2212\n+ ,0 .\n2A\n2\n2A\n2\n\u0001\ni\u03c6 i\nik\u03c6 1\nik\u03c6\nThe restriction of \u03c3 to \u2202R is \u03c3(\u03c6) = e , 2 (1 + e ), 2 (1 \u2212 e ), 0 .\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n13\n\nk\n\nThe intersection of \u03b3 and \u2202\u03c3 is given by the equations 2ei 2 \u03c6 = 1 + eik\u03c6 and 1 \u2212 eik\u03c6 = 0, and\nhence k\u03c6 = 4\u03c0n with n \u2208 Z. For k = 0, every point of \u2202\u03c3 lies in the curve of marked points, but\nby shifting the section a bit with the S1 -action, one obtains n(R, \u03b3) = 0. For k even, the curve \u03b3\nis parametrized by \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), and there are k/2 intersection points, for k odd, the curve \u03b3 closes\nfor \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0), and there are k intersection points.\nThe calculations so far did not depend on the contact form, but one can check that R has\ndifferent orientations for \u03b1+k and \u03b1\u2212k . This changes the orientation of \u2202\u03c3 and \u03b3, but also of \u2202R,\nand hence for (Wk5 , \u03b1k ), we have n(R, \u03b3) = k, and for (Wk5 , \u03b1\u2212k ), we have n(R, \u03b3) = \u2212k. \u0001\nThe complete set of invariants for (Wk5 , \u03b1\u00b1k ) is: The principal stabilizer is trivial, Wk5 (sing) is\nisomorphic to Etwist for k odd and to Etriv for k even, the cross-section is D2<1 \u00d7S1 , and n(R) = \u00b1k.\nIn particular it follows that the 5-sphere (S5 , \u03b1+ ) in Example 2 is equivalent to (W15 , \u03b1+1 ), and\n(S5 , \u03b1\u2212 ) is equivalent to (W15 , \u03b1\u22121 ).\nNote also that every 5-dimensional simply connected contact SO(3)-manifolds with singular\norbits is SO(3)-contactomorphic to one of the Brieskorn examples (Wk5 , \u03b1\u00b1k ). The reason is that\nthe orbit space M/ SO(3) of M has to be simply connected ([Bre72]), and must have boundary.\nHence M/ SO(3) is a 2-disc, and M(sing) has a single component. From this it follows that the\ncross-section is isomorphic to D2<1 \u00d7 S1 . If the principal stabilizer was isomorphic to Z2 , then it\nis easy to show by applying the Theorem of Seifert-van Kampen that \u03c01 (M ) \u223c\n= Z2 . Thus, the\nprincipal stabilizer has to be trivial, and all cases are covered by the Wk5 .\n2.4. Construction of 5-manifolds. In this section, we will construct a manifold M for each of\nthe possible combination of invariants given in Theorem 5.\n2.4.1. M(sing) = \u2205. The classification given in [KT91] shows that there is an S1 -invariant contact\nstructure without Legendrian orbits on any closed 3-dimensional contact S1 -manifolds R that does\nnot have special exceptional orbits or fixed points, and whose (orbifold) Euler number does not\nvanish. The 5-manifold M is then given by M \u223c\n= SO(3) \u00d7S1 R, where the circle on R acts with\nk-fold speed to get the desired stabilizer on M .\nOn the other hand, it follows from Lemma 7 that 0 \u2208\n/ \u03bc(M ), and thus R cannot have Legendrian\norbits. It is also clear that R cannot have fixed points.\n2.4.2. M(sing) 6= \u2205 and trivial principal stabilizer. Let R be any 3-dimensional S1 -manifold without\nfixed points and without special exceptional orbits, but with non-empty boundary \u2202R. By the\nrequirement that only the S1 -orbits on the boundary are Legendrian, the contact structure on R\nis uniquely determined ([KT91]).\nOver the interior of R, the 5-manifold M \u2217 = SO(3) \u00d7S1 (R \u2212 \u2202R) is a contact SO(3)-manifold.\nNow one has to glue in the singular orbits, in such a way as to get the chosen combination of\ncomponents of type Etriv and Etwist and the Dehn-Euler number n(R). First we will show how to\nglue in the standard model for Etriv ; for this, we need to have a standard form for a neighborhood\nof \u2202R.\nLet \u03c3 be any section in R that is compatible with the standard sections around the exceptional\norbits. In [Lut77] it has been shown that any contact form around \u2202R is equivalent to a standard\nform: Denote the coordinates of a collar S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 around a boundary component by (t, r, \u03c6)\nand let the S1 -action be ei\u03b8 * (t, r, \u03c6) = (t, r, \u03c6 + \u03b8). Every invariant contact form is up to an S1 contactomorphism equal to dt + r d\u03c6. In general the section \u03c3 will not be of the form \u03c3(eit , r) =\n(eit , r, 1) in the collar though, but it is not very difficult to arrange the model neighborhood in this\nway. Let [t] and [\u03c6] \u2208 H1 (M, Z) be the classes given by S1 \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 {1} and {1} \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 S1 . The\nsection \u03c3 represents an element [t] + a[\u03c6], and there is a linear map A \u2208 SL(2, Z) that induces an\nS1 -diffeomorphism, such that \u03c3 represents [t] in the new coordinates. The contact form becomes\n(1+ar) dt+r d\u03c6, which after dividing by 1+ar and rescaling in the r-direction can be transformed\nback into dt + r d\u03c6. Now by deforming \u03c3, one obtains a collar for the boundary where the action,\nthe contact form and the section are all in standard form.\nThe standard way of gluing is to consider S1 \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 with SO(3)-action on the second factor and\nwith the contact form dt+ \u03bbcan . The cross-section of S1 \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 looks exactly like the neighborhood\nof the boundary components of R, which allows us to identify both. Since the cross-section\n\n\f14\n\nKLAUS NIEDERKR\u00dcGER\n\ndetermines the 5-manifold lying over it, this gives a gluing of S1 \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 to M \u2217 . In the boundary,\nthe section \u03c3 and the curve of marked points are identical, but one can push \u03c3 a bit along the\nS1 -action to avoid having any intersection points. Thus the contribution of this gluing to n(R) is\nzero.\nTo construct a general M , i.e. an M with n(R) 6= 0 or with Etwist \u2282 M(sing) , we need to change\nthe construction.\nAssume first that we want to glue in a component of type Etriv , which adds 2c to the DehnEuler number. The neighborhood of \u2202R was chosen above to be S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 with contact form\ndt + r d\u03c6 and with a section \u03c3 of the form \u03c3(eit , r) = (eit , r, 1). The matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 c\nA=\n\u2208 SL(2, Z)\n0 1\ninduces a diffeomorphism, which can be isotoped as above to obtain a new model for the neighborhood of \u2202R, where \u03c3 represents the homology class [t] + c [\u03c6], and where the contact form is\nstill in standard form. Gluing Etriv along the cross-section R works again without any problem.\nThe intersection number between the section \u03c3 and the curve of marked points gives now c.\nTo glue in a component of type Etwist , recall that the cross-section around Etwist could be\ndescribed by R\u00d7[0, \u03b5)\u00d7S1 / \u223c with the equivalence relation (t, r, ei\u03c6 ) \u223c (t+1, r, ei(\u03c6+\u03c0) ) and contact\nform \u03b1 = dt + r d\u03c6. The curve of marked points was given by {(t, 0, 1)} and {(t, 0, \u22121)}. There is\nnow a diffeomorphism \u03a6 : S1 \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 \u2192 R \u00d7 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 S1 / \u223c, (e2\u03c0it , r, ei\u03c6 ) 7\u2192 (t, r, ei(\u03c6+\u03c0t/2) ).\nThe curve of marked points pulls back to {(e2\u03c0it , 0, e\u2212\u03c0it )}, and \u03a6\u2217 \u03b1 = (1 + \u03c0r/2) dt + r d\u03c6, which\ncan be isotoped into standard form. The model for the cross-section close to Etwist and close to\n\u2202R looks identical, and it is possible to glue both parts. The Dehn-Euler number n(R) can be\narranged in the desired way as above.\n2.4.3. M(sing) 6= \u2205 and principal stabilizer is Z2 . If the principal stabilizer is isomorphic to Z2 , then\nall components of M(sing) are equivalent to S1 \u00d7 RP2 . The gluing occurs completely analogous\nto the way it was done above: Choose identical charts for a neighborhood of \u2202R, and for the\ncross-section around M(sing) , and glue along these.\n2.5. Relation between the Dehn-Euler number and generalized Dehn twists. In this\nsection we want to show that the Dehn-Euler number n(R) counts the number of Dehn twists\nneeded to glue in the singular orbits.\nA k-fold Dehn twist \u03c4k on T \u2217 S2 can be constructed in the following way. Write a point in\n\u2217 2\nT S as (q, p) \u2208 R3 \u00d7 R3 with |q| = 1 and q \u22a5 p.\nIf one chooses in the map\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n* sin f (|p|), p * cos f (|p|) \u2212 |p| * q * sin f (|p|)\n\u03c4k (q, p) = q * cos f (|p|) +\n|p|\nthe function f to be f (r) = r, then \u03c4k is just the standard geodesic flow. Instead, we will use\nf (r) = \u03c0k(1 + \u03c1\u03b5 (r)) with \u03c1\u03b5 as defined in the proof of Lemma 10. The map is SO(3)-equivariant,\nand for small p, the map is \u03c4k \u2261 (\u22121)k id, while for large p, it is \u03c4k \u2261 id.\nThe canonical 1-form transforms like\n\u0001\n\u03c4k\u2217 \u03bbcan = \u03bbcan + |p| d f (|p|) .\n\nThis shows that \u03c4k would be a symplectomorphism of (T \u2217 S2 , d\u03bbcan ), but not a contactomorphism\nof dt + \u03bbcan on R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 . It is known ([Sei98]) that \u03c42n is isotopic to id and \u03c42n+1 is isotopic to\n\u03c41 (both in the space of diffeomorphisms with compact support).\nThe mapping torus\nR \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 / \u223c, where (t; q, p) \u223c (t + 1; \u03c4k (q, p))\nis then diffeomorphic to V \u2217 Etriv for k even and to V \u2217 Etwist for k odd.\nThe 1-form\n\u03b1 = dt + \u03bbcan \u2212 t|p| df\n\n\f5-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT SO(3)-MANIFOLDS\n\n15\n\non R \u00d7 T \u2217S2 is invariant under the equivalence relation, and thus projects down onto the mapping\ntorus. The contact condition for \u03b1 gives\n0 6= \u03b1 \u2227 (d\u03b1)2 = dt \u2227 (d\u03bbcan )2 \u2212 2|p|\u03bbcan \u2227 dt \u2227 df \u2227 d\u03bbcan = (1 \u2212 2|p|2 f \u2032 ) dt \u2227 d\u03bbcan 2 .\n2\n\nBecause max f \u2032 = c/\u03b5, by choosing \u03b5 small enough we can assure that 1 \u2212 2|p| f \u2032 6= 0, and \u03b1 is\nthen an SO(3)-invariant contact form.\nIn fact, because the map \u03c4k used to construct the mapping torus is the identity far away from\nthe zero-section and because the term t|p| df in \u03b1 disappears there, it is possible to cut out a\ncomponent of M(sing) and glue in R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 / \u223c to obtain a new contact SO(3)-manifold.\nIt only remains to see what effect this has on the integer n(R).\nThe cross-section R in R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 is equal to the one for the standard contact form\nn\n\u0001o\nR = t; (x, y, 0), (ry, \u2212rx, 0) / \u223c ,\n\nbecause the last term in \u03b1 does not change the moment map (\u03b9XM df = LXM f , but f only changes\nin radial direction).\nTo compute the local contribution to n(R), notice that the section \u03c3(t, r) = (t; (1, 0, 0), (0, \u2212r, 0))\non R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 does not descend to a continuous section on the mapping torus. Instead one could\nreplace \u03c3 by\n\u03c3(t, r) = (t; (cos tf (r), \u2212 sin tf (r), 0), (\u2212r * sin tf (r), \u2212r * cos tf (r), 0)) .\n\nSince \u03c3 remains unchanged far away from the singular orbits, it extends to the unmodified section,\nand it is easy to check that \u03c3 induces a continuous section on R \u00d7 T \u2217 S2 / \u223c.\nThe intersections of \u03c3 with the curve of marked points is given by (cos tf (0), \u2212 sin tf (0), 0) =\n(\u00b11, 0, 0), i.e. cos \u03c0kt = \u00b11 and sin \u03c0kt = 0, and then kt \u2208 Z. There are k points on \u2202R, where \u03c3\nintersects the marked set of points.\nIf k is odd, the boundary corresponds to Etwist . Then there is only a single curve of marked\npoints and the contribution of this boundary to n(R) is k. If k is even, then there are two disjoint\ncurves of marked points, and there are only k/2 intersection points with the first one. But since\nfor singular orbits of type Etriv this number is multiplied by 2, the contribution to n(R) is again k.\nThus the Dehn-Euler number n(R) counts the number of Dehn twists applied at M(sing) .\nAll constructions on S1 \u00d7 S2 in this section are Z2 -equivariant, and this allows us to build\nmanifolds with principal stabilizer Z2 and arbitrary n(R).\nReferences\n[Aud91]\n\nM.
