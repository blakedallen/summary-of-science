The formalism adopted by Antonsen and Chu can then be used to calculate the efficiency of current drive by\nfast waves in a relativistic plasma. Accurate numerical results and analytic asymptotic limits for the\nefficiencies are given.\n\n1\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\nCurrents may be efficiently generated in a plasma by the injection of rf waves whose phase velocities\nare several times the electron thermal speed.1 The efficiency, defined as the ratio of current generated to\npower dissipated, is achieved in this instance because the rf-generated plateau decays at a rate given by\nthe collision frequency for the fast electrons, which is relatively low. In the quest for higher efficiencies,\ncurrent drive by waves which interact with relativistic electrons has also been considered.2 Relativistic\neffects modify the scaling of the efficiency, placing an upper bound on the efficiency achievable by current\ndrive by fast waves. In this paper, we do several things: we give a more complete analysis of this problem\nbased on a formalism adopted by Antonsen and Chu.3 Specifically, we find that the effect of finite\nelectron temperature leads to an enhancement of the efficiency. In order to calculate this effect, we first\ngive expressions for the most important terms in the electron-electron collision integral in the relativistic\nlimit. These expressions are put in Rosenbluth form so as to be amenable to easy implementation on a\ncomputer. We imagine that the relativistic Rosenbluth potentials that we identify may be useful in other\nproblems arising in very hot plamas.\nIn order to put the present work in perspective, let us briefly review the chief tools used in the study\nof current drive. The early work used fairly crude analytical models.1,4 These models were sufficient\nto obtain the scaling laws for the efficiency of current drive, but were unable to provide the coefficients\nwith any accuracy. Therefore, the analytical treatment was supplemented by numerical solutions to the\ntwo-dimensional (in momentum space) Fokker\u2013Planck equation,5\u20138 from which accurate estimates of the\nefficiency could be found. The first accurate analytical treatment of current drive was based on a Langevin\nformulation of the electron motion.2,9 This involved taking the electron temperature to be small, allowing\nenergy scattering to be ignored. The moment hierarchy for the Langevin equations can then be closed,\nwhich allows an analytical solution to be obtained. This was followed by a more complete numerical\nstudy of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation for current drive in which the problem was reduced to the numerical\nsolution of a one-dimensional integro-differential equation with a source due to the rf.10 In this work\ntoroidal effects were also included. The results agreed with the Langevin analysis9 in the limit of large\nphase velocities (as they should) and gave more accurate numerical data for phase velocities comparable\nto or smaller than the thermal velocity. More recently, Antonsen and Chu3 and, independently, Taguchi,11\nusing methods first used in the study of beam-driven currents,12,13 recognized that it is not necessary to\nsolve the rf-driven Fokker\u2013Planck equation in order to find the rf-induced current. Instead, they showed\nthat the Green's function for the current is the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm function14 describing the perturbed electron\ndistribution in the presence of an electric field. This reduces the problem to the determination of a single\ntwo-dimensional function, from which the current generated by any form of rf drive can be calculated by\na simple integration.\nUp until now, the only reliable analytical results for current drive in a relativistic plasma are those\nobtained using the Langevin methods by Ref. 2. As we will show, these are only exact for Te \u226a me c2\nand p2 \u226b me Te (where p is the momentum of the resonant electrons). A more complete analytical or\nnumerical treatment along the lines of that achieved in the nonrelativistic case was hampered by the lack\nof a convenient form for the relativistic collision operator. This is remedied to some extent by the results\nof this paper where we calculate the collision integrals for the first Legendre harmonic of the perturbed\nelectron distribution neglecting electromagnetic effects on the binary interaction (in this approximation\nthe collision integral reduces to the Landau form). Having done this, we are able to generalize the\ntreatment of Antonsen and Chu3 to the relativistic case. A number of useful results flow from this: we\ncan numerically calculate to high precision the current-drive efficiencies in the relativistic regime. We\ncan perform an asymptotic analysis of the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm problem to obtain analytic approximations to\nthe efficiencies. In addition, we give higher-order asymptotic corrections to the current-drive efficiencies\nin the nonrelativistic limit. Throughout this paper, toroidal effects are entirely ignored. Although these\neffects are important in the study of current drive by low-phase-velocity waves, they play little role in\n\n2\n\n\fcurrent drive by fast waves. Incorporation of these effects, however, proceeds in exact analogy with the\ntreatment for the nonrelativistic case.3\nRelativistic effects on rf current drive have also been considered by Hizanidis and Bers.15 They take\nmoments of the kinetic equation. In order to close the resulting system of equations, they approximate the\nsteady-state electron distribution by a delta function. This approximation is unjustified and, consequently,\ntheir results for the current-drive efficiency are incorrect.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we show how the relativistic collision operator may be\nreduced to the Landau form. In this form, the collision operator is costly to evaluate numerically. So, in\nSec. III we convert the collision integrals to a Rosenbluth form, which may be evaluated very efficiently.\nThe formulation of Antonsen and Chu is generalized to the relativistic case in Sec. IV. The numerical\nresults for the efficiencies are given in Sec. V and the asymptotic results in Sec. VI. Finally, in Sec. VII,\nwe examine the asymptotic form of the efficiencies using the full relativistic collision operator.\n\nII. RELATIVISTIC COLLISION OPERATOR\nThe collision operator for a relativistic plasma is given by Beliaev and Budker.16 They give the\ncollision operator as\n\u2202fa (p)\n\u2202t\n\ncoll\n\n=\n\nC(fa , fb ) =\n\nX\n\nC(fa , fb ),\n\nb\nqa2 qb2\n8\u03c0\u01eb20\n\nlog \u039ba/b\n\n(1a)\n\u2202\n*\n\u2202p\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202fa (p)\n\u2202fb (p\u2032 )\nd3 p\u2032 ,\nU * fb (p\u2032 )\n\u2212 fa (p)\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\u2032\n\n(1b)\n\nwhere the kernel U is given by\nU=\n\n\u03b3a \u03b3b\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03b2a * \u03b2\u2032b )2\n{[\u03b3 2 \u03b3 \u20322 (1 \u2212 \u03b2a * \u03b2\u2032b )2 \u2212 1]I\n2\nc[\u03b3a \u03b3b\u20322 (1 \u2212 \u03b2a * \u03b2\u2032b )2 \u2212 1]3/2 a b\n\u2212 \u03b3a2 \u03b2a \u03b2a \u2212 \u03b3b\u20322 \u03b2\u2032b \u03b2\u2032b + \u03b3a2 \u03b3b\u20322 (1 \u2212 \u03b2a * \u03b2\u2032b )(\u03b2a \u03b2\u2032b +\n\n\u03b2\u2032b \u03b2a )}.\n\n(2)\n\nHere a and b are species labels, qs is the charge of species s, log \u039ba/b is the Coulomb logarithm, \u01eb0\nis the dielectric constant, p is the momentum, vs = c\u03b2s = p/ms \u03b3s is the velocity of species s, and\n\u03b3s = (1 + p2 /m2s c2 )1/2 . The distributions are normalized so that\nZ\nfs (p) d3 p = ns ,\nthe number density. We are primarily interested in situations where fast electrons are colliding off a\nweakly relativistic background. In that case \u03b2b\u2032 \u226a 1, and we can approximate U by its nonrelativistic\nform\nu2 I \u2212 uu\n, u = va \u2212 vb\u2032 .\n(1c)\nU=\nu3\nSince the original form for U was symmetric in the primed and unprimed variables, we could equally\nwell have obtained Eq. (1c) under the assumption that \u03b2a \u226a 1. The relative difference between Eqs. (1c)\nand (2) is O(\u03b2b\u2032 ). However, the error in the collision operator C(fa , fb ) is smaller than this. This point\nis examined in more detail in Sec. VII. Equations (1) are precisely the collision operator given by Landau.17 Indeed an examination of his derivation shows that the mechanics of the collisions are treated\nrelativistically; the interaction, however, is calculated nonrelativistically assuming a Coulomb potential.\nUse of Landau collision operator implies a neglect of the relativistic (i.e., electromagnetic) effects on the\nbinary interaction. What we have shown here is that such an approximation is valid provided at least one\nof the colliding particles is nonrelativistic.\n3\n\n\fIt is readily established that Eqs. (1) conserve number, momentum, and energy (Es = ms c2 \u03b3s ), that an\n\u2032\nH-theorem applies, and that the\np equilibrium solution is a relativistic Maxwellian fs (p) \u221d exp(\u2212Es /T ),\n\u2032\n2\n2\nwhere Es = (Es \u2212 vd * p)/ 1 \u2212 vd /c is the energy in a frame moving at vd , and T and vd are\nindependent of the species s.\nThroughout the rest of this paper we will restrict our attention to an electron-ion plasma. We assume\nthe ions are stationary and infinitely massive (mi \u2192 \u221e). This allows us to express the electron-ion\ncollision operator in (p, \u03bc) space (where \u03bc = pk /p and k and \u22a5 are with respect to the magnetic field) as\nC(f, fi ) = \u0393\nwhere\n\u0393=\n\nZ \u2202\n\u2202\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) f (p),\n2vp2 \u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nne qe4 log \u039be/e\n,\n4\u03c0\u01eb20\n\nZ=\u2212\n\nqi\nqi log \u039be/i\n\u2248\u2212 ,\nqe\nqe log \u039be/e\n\nand we have assumed neutrality qe ne + qi ni = 0. In Eq. (3) and henceforth we will omit the species\nlabels from all electron quantities.\n\nIII. GENERALIZATION OF THE ROSENBLUTH POTENTIALS\nFor computational purposes, the Landau operator is not the most convenient form for the collision\noperator. If the plasma is azimuthally symmetric, a two-dimensional integration must be performed at\neach point in momentum space. If the number of grid points is N \u00d7 N , this requires O(N 4 ) calculations.\nThis requirement is dramatically reduced in the nonrelativistic case by expressing the collision operator\nin terms of Rosenbluth potentials.18 Unfortunately, although the Landau operator can be used without\nchange to describe the collisions in a relativistic Coulomb plasma, the Rosenbluth form no longer applies.\n(The derivation of the Rosenbluth form from the Landau form requires, for instance, that (\u2202/\u2202p) * U =\n\u2212(\u2202/\u2202p\u2032 ) * U, a relation that only holds nonrelativistically.)\nHowever, because the kernel of the collision integral Eq. (1c) has the same form as in the nonrelativistic case, it is possible to borrow some of the techniques of Ref. 18. We convert the p\u2032 integration in\nEq. (1b) to v\u2032 space, substitute a particular Legendre component for f (p\u2032 ), and manipulate the resulting\nintegrals into the form\nZ\n|v \u2212 v\u2032 | Pk (\u03bc\u2032 )h(v \u2032 ) d3 v\u2032\n\nor\n\nZ\n\n|v \u2212 v\u2032 |\n\n\u22121\n\nPk (\u03bc\u2032 )h(v \u2032 ) d3 v\u2032 ,\n\nwhich may be evaluated in the same way as Rosenbluth potentials18 (Pk is a Legendre polynomial).\nHere we give the resulting expressions for collisions off a stationary Maxwellian background, i.e.,\nC(f, fm ), and for collisions of a Maxwellian off the first Legendre component of a background, i.e.,\nC(fm , \u03bcf1 ). In both cases only electron-electron collisions are considered. These terms are all that\nare required for the solution of the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm problem (giving the Green's function for the rf current\ndrive) and they suffice for an accurate numerical solution of the two-dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck equation\nas described in Sec.

This means that all our normalized efficiencies are a factor of\ntwo smaller than in these earlier papers. (We made this change because the normalized Fokker\u2013Planck\nequation in the high-energy limit now has a simpler form. This convention is also used by other workers\nin this field.)\n5\n\n\fFor p \u226b pt , the indefinite limits in the integrals in Eq. (4) can be replaced by \u221e, giving20\nvt2\n,\nv3 \u0012\n\u0013\nv2\n1\n1 \u2212 t2 .\nB(p) = \u0393\n2v\nv\nA(p) = \u0393\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n\nNote that the frictional force F (p) reaches a constant value as p \u2192 \u221e. This implies, for instance, that\nan electric field smaller than \u0393vt2 /qT c2 cannot produce runaways.21 On the other hand, the pitch-angle\nscattering frequency B(p)/p2 continues to decay as p \u2192 \u221e. As the energy of the electron increases,\nits effective mass increases. It is then more difficult to deflect the heavier particle. In this limit, pitchangle scattering is negligible compared with frictional slowing down. This is to be contrasted with the\nnonrelativistic case where the pitch-angle scattering frequency and the frictional slowing-down rate decay\nas 1/p2 and the two processes are of comparable importance.\nThe implication for current drive is that the efficiency of parallel wave-induced fluxes, say by lowerhybrid waves, approaches a constant. This can be seen as follows: Nonrelativistically, the efficiency\nincreases as p2 . Relativistic electrons, however, slow down faster because they are heavier, and they\nalso do not carry more current when pushed in the parallel direction. Each of these effects reduces the\nefficiency by \u03b3 \u223c p; hence the approach to a constant.\nThe other term we shall need is C(fm , \u03bcf1 ). This term is rather harder to compute. We define\nf1 (p) = fm (p)\u03c71 (p) and write C(fm , \u03bcfm \u03c71 ) = \u03bcfm I(\u03c71 ). Again, we reduce (this time after much\nalgebra) the integrals in Eq.

The simplification of Eq. (7) was achieved, in part, with the help\nof the symbolic manipulation program, MACSYMA.22\nEquations (4) and (7) are now in a computationally convenient form. Their evaluation involves the\ndetermination of a number of indefinite integrals (the unprimed variables should be factored out of the\nintegrals for this step), and the multiplication of these integrals by various functions of p. If the distribution functions are known on a grid of N points, then the computational cost is just O(N ). Furthermore,\nthe calculation can be arranged so that nearly all the computations vectorize.23 The general solution of\nthe linearized electron-electron collision operator C(f, fm ) + C(fm , f ) = 0 is\nf = (a + b * p + cE)fm ,\nwhere a, b, and c are arbitrary constants. With a = c = 0 and b = p\u0302k , this provides a useful check on\nEqs. (4) and (7) and their computational realizations.\n6\n\n\fIV. FORMULATION\nWe now turn to the calculation of the rf efficiency. There are three steps involved: the specification of\nthe rf current-drive problem, the identification of the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm function as the Green's function for\nthe rf-driven current; and the solution of the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm problem.\nWe begin with the specification of the problem. This is just a standard application of the Chapman\u2013\nEnskog procedure.24 The most important assumption is that the collisional time scale is much shorter\nthan the transport time scale (the time scale for heating the plasma by the rf). This places some restrictions\non the rf drive. However, these are usually not severe ones in the case of fast-wave current drive because,\neven if the rf is strong, there are few resonant particles and, consequently, the heating rate is small.\nThe effect of the rf is to induce an electron flux\nS = \u2212D *\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202p\n\n(8)\n\nin momentum space, where D is the quasilinear diffusion tensor.25 In the Chapman\u2013Enskog ordering\nthis is taken to be of first order. The zeroth-order electron distribution is given by setting the collision\nterm C(f, f ) + C(f, fi ) equal to zero. The general solution is a Maxwellian Eq. (5) with n and T\narbitrary functions of time and position. For simplicity we ignore the spatial variations. Since the rf\ndrive is particle conserving, we may take n to be a constant. A drifting Maxwellian does not solve the\nzeroth-order system since the ions are taken to be stationary.\nThe first-order equation is given by substituting f = fm (1 + \u03c8) with \u03c8 ordered small to give\nC(fm \u03c8) =\n\nd\n(E \u2212 hEi)\n\u2202\n*S+\nfm log T,\n\u2202p\nT\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nC(f ) = C(f, fm ) + C(fm , f ) + C(f, fi )\nis the linearized collision operator, and hEi is the mean energy per particle\nZ\n1\nhEi =\nEfm (p) d3 p\nn\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22121\n)\n2 K1 (\u0398\n+ 3\u0398 .\n= mc\nK2 (\u0398\u22121 )\n\n(10)\n19\n\nThe last term in Eq. (9) represents the heating of the Maxwellian. The equation for the time evolution of\nT is given by the solubility condition for Eq. (9), which is obtained by taking its energy moment. Since\nthe linearized collision operator is energy conserving (recall that we take the limit mi \u2192 \u221e, so that there\nis no energy exchange between electron and ions), this gives\nn\n\nd hEi\n=P\ndt\n\nwhere P is the power dissipated per unit volume by the rf\nZ\nP = S * v d3 p.\n\n(11)\n\n[There is another solubility condition given by the density moment of Eq. (9). This is automatically\nsatisfied by taking dn/dt = 0.] The solution to Eq. (9) is made unique by demanding that fm \u03c8 have zero\ndensity and energy.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the nonrelativistic limit, Eq. (9) is the equation solved numerically by Cordey et al.10 However,\nsince we are usually interested primarily in the current density generated by the rf\nZ\nJ = q vk fm \u03c8 d3 p,\n(12)\nand the efficiency of current generation defined by the ratio J/P , we usually do not need to know the full\nsolution for \u03c8.\nThe method for determining the current without solving for \u03c8 was given by Hirshman12 and by\nTaguchi13 for neutral-beam-driven currents and was introduced into the study of rf-driven currents by\nAntonsen and Chu3 and Taguchi.11 The key is to define an \"adjoint\" problem\nC(fm \u03c7) = \u2212qvk fm .\n\n(13)\n\nAgain fm \u03c7 is required to have zero density and energy. This is the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm problem for the perturbed electron distribution function\nR due to an electric\nR field E = T p\u0302k . Using the self-adjoint property of\nthe linearized collision operator \u03c8C(fm \u03c7) d3 p = \u03c7C(fm \u03c8) d3 p, it is readily found that\nZ\n\u2202\nJ = S*\n\u03c7(p) d3 p.\n(14)\n\u2202p\nIn this equation \u03c7 plays the role of a Green's function for the rf-driven current. The ratio of Eqs. (14) and\n(11) gives the efficiency\nZ\n\u2202\n\u03c7(p) d3 p\nS*\nJ\n\u2202p\nZ\n.\n(15)\n=\nP\nS * v d3 p\n\nAn important special case is when the rf excitation is localized. Then it is only necessary to know the\nposition and direction of the excitation to determine the efficiency\nJ\n=\nP\n\n\u015c *\n\n\u2202\n\u03c7(p)\n\u2202p\n,\n\u015c * v\n\n(16)\n\nwhere all quantities are now evaluated at the position of the excitation. If we compare this method with\nthe Langevin method of Fisch,2 we see that \u03c7 is the mean-integrated current due to a group of electrons\nreleased at p at t = 0\nZ\n\u221e\n\nvk dt.\n\n\u03c7(p) = q\n\n0\n\nThe power of these results is that the calculation of J/P does not require a solution of Eq. (9) for the rf\ndistribution \u03c8. On the other hand, Eq. (13) must be solved for the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm function \u03c7. This reduces\nto the solution of a one-dimensional integro-differential equation, which may be accurately computed.\nFurthermore, in the nonrelativistic limit, it has been tabulated.14 This method also substantially reduces\nthe parameter space to be investigated numerically. The solution of Eq. (13) depends on two parameters\nonly, Z and \u0398. In contrast, the solution of Eq. (9) depends on various parameters specifying the nature\nof the rf excitation (for instance, the direction of S, the minimum and maximum phase velocities, etc.) as\nwell as Z and \u0398.\nIn order to determine the rf current-drive efficiency using Eqs. (15) or (16), we must solve the Spitzer\u2013\nH\u00e4rm problem, Eq. (13). The solution \u03c7 consists of only the first Legendre harmonic, so we substitute\n\u03c7(p) = \u03bc\u03c71 (p) into Eq. (13) giving\n1 \u2202 2\n\u2202\u03c71\nvA(p) \u2202\u03c71\n2B(p) + \u0393Z/v\n\u03c71 + I(\u03c71 ) + qv = 0,\np A(p)\n\u2212\n\u2212\np2 \u2202p\n\u2202p\nT\n\u2202p\np2\n8\n\n(17)\n\n\fwhere A(p) and B(p) are given by Eq. (4), the electron-ion term is given by Eq. (3), and I(\u03c71 ) is given\nby Eq. (7). The fact that the solution of Eq. (13) consists of only a single Legendre component constitutes\nan additional advantage to this method of determining current-drive efficiencies. The solution of the full\nrf problem given in Eq. (9) consists, in general, of many Legendre components. Often some truncation is\nperformed in computing these numerically.\nEquation (17) may be solved by approximate analytic methods either by expressing \u03c7 as a sum of\nSonine polynomials24,26 or by formulating the equation as a variational problem.12 These methods have\nthe disadvantage that they generally fail to reproduce the correct asymptotic (large p) form for \u03c7. This\nfailing does not affect the calculation of the electrical conductivity significantly since in that case \u03c7 is\nintegrated with a weighting factor proportional to fm . However, it rules out such methods for the study\nof rf current drive, since the efficiency may depend on the local value of \u03c7.\nThis leaves us either with asymptotic methods, which we apply in Sec. VI, or with numerical methods.\nNumerical solutions to Eq. (17) have been given in the nonrelativistic case in Refs. 14 and 27. Here we\nuse a simpler method that avoids most of the problems with the application of boundary conditions. We\ncast Eq. (17) as a one-dimensional diffusion equation by setting the left-hand side to \u2202\u03c71 /\u2202t and solve\nthis diffusion equation until a steady state is reached. (The initial conditions may be chosen arbitrarily.)\nThe integration is carried out in the domain 0 < p < pmax and the boundary conditions \u03c7(0) = 0 and\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (pmax ) = 0 are imposed. The diffusion equation describes the physical problem of the evolution of\nthe perturbed electron distribution in the presence of an electric field and is therefore guaranteed to give\nthe correct solution of Eq. (13) without having to worry about spurious solutions that diverge at p = 0 or\np = \u221e. Since this is a one-dimensional diffusion equation, it may be solved by treating the differential\noperator fully implicitly (the time step may be taken to be large). The integral operator I(\u03c71 ) is treated\nexplicitly and is recomputed after every time step. In the calculations shown here, the momentum step\nsize was taken to be pt /50, the time step was taken to be 1000/\u03bdt, and the process converged (i.e., the\nrelative change in \u03c71 per step was less than 1 part in 1010 ) after about 50 steps.\nIn the following sections we will also need the function G(p) = \u03c71 (p)/p so that \u03c7(p) = pk G(p). In\nterms of G, the gradient of \u03c7 is\n\u2202\n\u03c7(p) = G(p)p\u0302k + pk Gp (p)p\u0302,\n\u2202p\nwhere Gp (p) = dG(p)/dp.\n\nV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nThe solution for \u03c7 is given as a contour plot in Fig. 1 for Z = 1 and \u0398 = 0 and 0.01. From these and\na knowledge of S, the direction of the rf-induced current can be determined. In the nonrelativistic case,\nFig. 1(a), \u03c7 rises ever more steeply as p is increased, giving the favorable p2 scaling for the current-drive\nefficiency.9 On the other hand, in a hot plasma, Fig. 1(b), the slope reaches a constant (the contour levels\nare equally spaced), leading to a limit in the efficiency of the current drive.2\nFigure 1 also shows that the contours become vertical for pk small. This indicates that pushing\nelectrons with small pk in the perpendicular direction (as with cyclotron-damped waves) is not effective\nin generating current. Pushing electrons in the parallel direction is effective, especially for small pk , since\nthe denominator in Eq. (16) can be small. In general, when the contours of constant energy (p = constant)\ncross contours of constant \u03c7, the efficiency can be very large.\nTurning now to the numerical results for the efficiency, we begin with the case of a localized spectrum,\nEq. (16). Although this situation may not be realized in practice, it is important because it can help us to\ndetermine the best current-drive schemes by showing where in velocity space to induce the flux. There\nare two major classes of fast waves that have been considered for current drive, namely Landau-damped\n9\n\n\fwaves (e.g., lower-hybrid waves) for which \u015c = p\u0302k and cyclotron-damped waves for which \u015c = p\u0302\u22a5 .\nTaking the limit p\u22a5 \u2192 0, we have\n\nG(p) + pGp (p)\nJ\n=\n(18a)\nP\nv\nJ\npGp (p)\n=\n(18b)\nP\nv\nfor Landau-damped and cyclotron-damped waves, respectively. The efficiencies are plotted in Fig. 2 for\nZ = 1 and \u0398 = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 (these correspond to T = 0, 10, 26, 51, and 102 keV).\nThe curves for \u0398 = 0 in the two cases are given analytically from Eq. (24); they agree with the results\nof Ref. 2. This confirms the earlier analysis and shows that it is exact in the limit of T \u226a mc2 and\np2 \u226b mT .\nWe next consider current drive by a narrow spectrum of Landau-damped waves. In this case, all particles satisfying the Landau resonance condition \u03c9 \u2212 kk vk = 0 interact with the wave, and the quasilinear\ndiffusion tensor is\nD \u221d \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 kk vk )p\u0302k p\u0302k\n\u221d \u03b3 \u03b4(pk \u2212 mvp \u03b3)p\u0302k p\u0302k ,\n\nwhere vp = \u03c9/kk is the parallel wave phase velocity. Assuming that the electron distribution is weakly\nperturbed, we can take f = fm in Eq. (8) to give\nS \u221d \u03b3 vk fm \u03b4(pk \u2212 mvp \u03b3)p\u0302k .\nWhen we substitute this expression into Eq. (15), we obtain\nZ \u221e\u0010\n\u0011\n(m\u03b3vp )2\nGp (p) \u03b3fm (p)p dp\nG(p) +\np\n1 p0\nJ\nZ \u221e\n=\n,\nP\nvp\n\u03b3fm (p)p dp\n\n(19)\n\np0\n\nmvp /(1\u2212vp2/c2 )1/2\n\nwhere p0 =\nis the minimum resonant momentum. This efficiency is plotted in Fig. 3.\nIn the limit vp \u2192 0, the efficiency becomes large. This demonstrates that current may be efficiently driven\nby low phase velocity waves as was proposed by Wort.4\nA similar analysis can be performed for a narrow spectrum of cyclotron-damped waves. The situation is more complicated here because the electron cyclotron frequency depends relativistically on the\nmomentum28 and because relativistic effects distort the diffusion paths.8 In addition, the variation of the\ndiffusion coefficient with p\u22a5 depends on the harmonic number. This means that the efficiency depends on\nthree wave parameters \u03c9/kk , \u03a9/kk (\u03a9 is the rest-mass cyclotron frequency), and the harmonic number.\nWe therefore will only treat this case in the nonrelativistic limit.\nIn the nonrelativistic limit (\u0398 \u2192 0, p/mc \u2192 0), the efficiencies for both kinds of waves have been\ncalculated by Cordey et al.10 and Taguchi.11 They considered a narrow spectrum of Landau-damped\nwaves for which the efficiency is given by the nonrelativistic limit of Eq. (19) and a narrow spectrum of\ncyclotron-damped waves for which the diffusion coefficient is\n2(l\u22121)\n\nD \u221d v\u22a5\n\n\u03b4(vk \u2212 vp )p\u0302\u22a5 p\u0302\u22a5 ,\n\nwhere l is the harmonic number and vp = (\u03c9 \u2212 l\u03a9)/kk . Assuming that f = fm in Eq. (8), the efficiency\nfor cyclotron-damped waves is\nZ \u221e\n(p2 \u2212 p20 )l fm (p)Gp (p) dp\nJ\np\n= m2 vp 0Z \u221e\n,\n(20)\nP\n(p2 \u2212 p20 )l fm (p)p dp\np0\n\n10\n\n\fwhere p0 = mvp . (Here we consider only the fundamental cyclotron resonance l = 1.) In Fig. 4, we\nplot these efficiencies normalized to the thermal quantities together with the asymptotic results, Eqs. (31)\nand (32a). For mvp \u226b pt , the efficiencies scale as vp2 as predicted by Fisch and Boozer.9 The 1/vp\nscaling seen in the Landau-damping case for mvp \u226a pt is obtained by taking the limit vp \u2192 0 in\nEq. (19) to give\nR\nJ\n1 D(p\u22a5 )fm (p\u22a5 )G(p\u22a5 )p\u22a5 dp\u22a5\nR\n.\n(21)\n=\nP\nvp\nD(p\u22a5 )fm (p\u22a5 )p\u22a5 dp\u22a5\n\nHere we have included an arbitrary dependence of D on p\u22a5 . In Ref. 6, three different types of low-phasevelocity current drive were identified, namely by Landau damping, transit-time magnetic pumping, and\nAlfv\u00e9n waves. These methods differ in the forms for D(p\u22a5 )\n\uf8f1\n(Landau damping),\n\uf8f21\n(transit-time magnetic pumping),\nD(p\u22a5 ) = (p\u22a5 /pt )4\n\uf8f3\n[2 \u2212 (p\u22a5 /pt )2 ]2 (Alfv\u00e9n waves).\nThe case plotted in Fig. 4 is the first one (Landau damping).

The coefficients for Z = 1 should be compared with the\n(less exact) results of Ref. 6 obtained by a numerical solution of the two-dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck\nequation where the constants of proportionality are given as 4, 6.5, and 6.5, respectively. The coefficient\nCL has been determined analytically by Cordey et al.10 to be\n\u221a\n3 2\u03c0\nCL =\n.\n2Z\nThe dependence on Z indicates that the current is unaffected by electron-electron collisions. This result\nmay be derived by taking the momentum moment of Eq. (13). The electron-electron collision term then\ndrops out (from momentum conservation) and the electron-ion term is proportional to the numerator in\nEq. (21).\nThe last numerical example is one in which we relax the condition that f = fm in Eq. (8). This\nallows us to find the flux S that develops in the presence of high rf power. In order to determine S, we\nnumerically solve the two-dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck equation\n\u2202\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n= Cnum (f ) +\n*D*\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\n(22)\n\nuntil a steady state is reached. The numerical collision operator is defined as\nCnum (f ) = C(f, fm ) + C(fm , \u03bcf1 ) + C(f, fi ),\nwhere \u03bcf1 is the first Legendre harmonic of f . The electron-ion term C(f, fi ) is calculated using Eq. (3).\nIn order to justify our handling of the electron-electron collisions, let us consider the linearized\nelectron-electron operator C(f, fm ) + C(fm , f ). The first term describes the relaxation of the tail particles on the bulk and the second describes the concomitant heating of the bulk. The linearization is\njustified even with strong rf, as long as f (p) \u2248 fm (p) for E \u223c T . The linearized electron-electron\noperator conserves energy, and if this were used in Eq. (22), there would be nothing to balance the power\ninput by the rf (there is no transfer of energy to the ions in the limit mi \u2192 \u221e), and so a steady-state\nsolution to Eq. (22) would not be possible. In Eq. (9), this is handled by allowing the temperature of the\n11\n\n\fMaxwellian to increase slowly with time. In the numerical code, we adopt a different approach, namely\nto modify the collision operator so that energy is lost in an innocuous way. The term responsible for the\nbulk heating is the second term C(fm , f ). Let us write f in this term as a Legendre harmonic expansion\nf (p) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPk (\u03bc)fk (p).\n\nk=0\n\nOf the terms in this series, only one, the k = 0 term, contributes to the bulk heating. (The energy\nmoments of the other terms vanish.) Thus in order to lose energy we drop the term C(fm , f0 ). Of\nthe remaining terms in the series, only the first, the m = 1 term, is of importance-it is responsible\nfor ensuring conservation of momentum. Thus we retain only this term and approximate C(fm , f ) by\nC(fm , \u03bcf1 ) to give the collision operator Cnum .\nThe collision operator Cnum has the following properties: energy is not conserved (thus allowing a\nsteady state to be reached); momentum is conserved; and quantities such as the Spitzer-H\u00e4rm conductivity, which are given solely in terms of the first Legendre harmonic, are correctly given. To justify the way\nin which energy conservation is handled, we may check that the results are insensitive to the details of\nhow this is done. One such check is given below where we compare the efficiency given by the numerical\nsolution of Eq. (22), in which energy is lost, and that given by Eq. (15), where energy is conserved.\nWe assume that the rf diffusion term in Eq. (22) is caused by high-power lower-hybrid waves whose\nphase velocities lie between v1 and v2 . Thus we take\n\u001a\nD(p)p\u0302k p\u0302k , for v1 < pk /(m\u03b3) < v2 ,\nD=\n0,\notherwise\nwhere D(p) is chosen to be large enough to plateau f . [Here we choose D(p) = 10 \u03bdt p2t /(1 + p/pt ).]\nFigure 5 shows the steady-state solution of Eq. (22) for Z = 1, \u0398 = 0.01 (T \u2248 5 keV), v1 = 0.4c =\n4pt /m, and v2 = 0.7c = 7pt /m (the parallel refractive index satisfies 1.43 < nk < 2.5). Using the\nnumerical solution for f (p) and S(p), and the definitions (11) and (12), we obtain J = 3.74 \u00d7 10\u22124qnc,\nP = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u22123 mnc2 \u03bdc , and J/P = 0.293 q/mc\u03bdc.\nThis is to be compared with the result given by Eq. (14) with the numerically determined flux S(p),\nnamely J = 3.77 \u00d7 10\u22124qnc and J/P = 0.296 q/mc\u03bdc. (The figure for P remains unchanged since this\ndepends on S alone.) These two sets of figures are within 1% of each other. The excellent agreement\nillustrates two points: the approximations made in the numerical collision operator, namely, the neglect of\nthe heating term C(fm , f0 ), has little effect on the results for the current-drive efficiencies (discretization\neffects are probably a greater source of error in these results); and the analytic result Eq. (15) can be used\nto obtain reliable figures for the efficiency for cases of strong rf. What is needed in the latter instance is\nan estimate for the rf flux S. This may be found from a numerical solution of a two-dimensional Fokker\u2013\nPlanck equation (as here) or from an approximate analytical solution. Some saving may be possible using\nthis method in conjunction with a numerical code: since S reaches a steady state sooner than f , it may not\nbe necessary to run the code so long in order to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate for the efficiency.\n\nVI. ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS\nWe have seen that the efficiency of current drive may be expressed in terms of the solution of the\nSpitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm problem, Eq. (17). This equation may be approximately solved in the limit p \u226b pt . We\nwill begin with the relativistic case and later treat the nonrelativistic limit. We start by writing down the\nnormalized form of Eq. (17) in the limit p \u226b pt . We chose normalizations based upon q, m, c, and\n\u03bdc . Thus momenta are normalized to mc, \u03c71 to qc/\u03bdc , J/P to q/mc\u03bdc , etc. We use the same symbols\nto represent the normalized and unnormalized quantities. The coefficients A(p) and B(p) are given by\n12\n\n\fEqs. (6), suitably normalized. The integral term may be evaluated by replacing the indefinite limits in\nEq. (7) by \u221e, giving when normalized\n\u0012\n\u0013\nHb (\u0398, Z)\n3/2 Ha (\u0398, Z)\nI(\u03c71 ) \u2248 \u0398\n+\nvp\nv2\nwhere Ha and Hb are definite integrals of \u03c71 (and thus independent of momentum) that must be determined numerically. In the limit \u0398 \u2192 0, both Ha and Hb are finite. In normalized form with p2 \u226b \u0398,\nEq. (17) reads\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0398Vt2 \u2202 2 \u03c71\n2 \u2202\u03c71\n3\nv\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nv3\n\u2202p2\n\u0398 v\u03b3 3\np \u2202p\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n\u0398Vt2\nHb\n3/2 Ha\n\u2212 2 1 + Z \u2212 2 \u03c71 + \u0398\n+ 2 + v = 0. (23)\nvp\nv\nvp\nv\nThe error in this equation is exponentially small.\nWe now make a subsidiary expansion in small \u0398. In the limit \u0398 \u2192 0, several terms in Eq.

In particular for Z = 1 we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b3+1\n(vp \u2212 2 log \u03b3).\n\u03c71 =\n\u03b3\u22121\n\nOf particular interest is the efficiency for large p since this gives a limit to the efficiency of current drive\nby fast waves. If we let p \u226b 1, the integral may be approximately evaluated to give\n\u03c71 \u2192 p \u2212 (1 + Z) log p.\nIf we now take \u0398 to be finite, Eq. (23) cannot be easily solved. However, we may solve it in the limit\np \u226b 1. We achieve this by writing\n\u03c71 \u2248 \u03b1p + \u03b2 log p\n(25)\n\nin analogy to the situation with \u0398 = 0. Substituting this form of \u03c71 into Eq. (23) and balancing terms of\nequal order in p gives\n1 + \u03983/2 Hb\n\u03b1=\n(26a)\nVt2\nfrom the O(p0 ) terms and\n\u03b2=\u2212\n\n(1 + Z \u2212 3\u0398Vt2 )\u03b1 \u2212 \u03983/2 Ha\nVt2\n\n(26b)\n\nfrom the O(p\u22121 ) terms. When the rf excitation is localized, the current-drive efficiency is given by\nEqs. (18) that, with \u03c71 given by Eq. (25), read\nJ\n\u03b2\n\u2248\u03b1+\nP\np\n1 \u2212 log p\nJ\n\u2248\u03b2\nP\np\n13\n\n(27a)\n(27b)\n\n\ffor current drive by Landau-damped and cyclotron-damped waves, respectively. [The factor of 1/v in\nEqs. (18) is replaced by unity in the limit p \u2192 \u221e.] Equation (27a) (with p replaced by p0 ) also applies\nfor current drive by a narrow spectrum as given by Eq. (19). In the limit of p \u2192 \u221e, the efficiency of\ncyclotron-damped current drive vanishes, while for current drive by Landau-damped waves J/P \u2192 \u03b1.\nIn order to determine this limiting efficiency, either Eq. (26a) may be evaluated using the numerically\nfound value of Hb (\u0398, Z) (see Table II) or else the equation may be expanded as a series in \u0398 to give for\np\u2192\u221e\nJ\n5\n\u2248 1 + \u0398 + Hb (0, Z)\u03983/2 .\n(28)\nP\n2\nHb (0, Z) is tabulated in Table III.\nWe now turn to the solution of Eq. (17) in the nonrelativistic limit \u0398 \u2192 0. We shall still consider only\nthe limit p \u226b pt . The limits here are nonuniform. Equation (23) was obtained by taking p \u226b pt followed\nby \u0398 \u2192 0. Here we will take the limits in the opposite order. To do this, it is convenient to renormalize\nEq. (17) using q, m, pt , and \u03bdt as the system of units. In this case, J/P is normalized to q/pt \u03bdt . Making\nthis change of normalization and taking the limit \u0398 \u2192 0 is equivalent to formally replacing \u0398 by unity\nand substituting v = p, \u03b3 = 1, and Vt2 = 1 in Eq. (23) to give\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2202 2 \u03c71\n1\n1\nH\n1 \u2202\u03c71\n\u2212\n1\n+\nZ\n\u2212\n\u03c71 + 2 + p = 0,\n\u2212\np\n+\n(29)\np3 \u2202p2\np \u2202p\np3\np2\np\nwhere H(Z) = Ha (0, Z)+ Hb (0, Z) (this is tabulated in Table III). For p \u226b 1 (in this normalization this\nmeans p \u226b pt ), we may develop an asymptotic expression for \u03c71 as a series in powers of p. Balancing\nthe terms in Eq. (29) from O(p) (the leading order) to O(p\u22124 ) gives\n\u03c71 =\n\n9p2\nHp\n9\np4\n+\n+\n+\n+ O(p\u22122 ).\n5+Z\n(5 + Z)(3 + Z) 2 + Z\n(5 + Z)(3 + Z)(1 + Z)\n\nFor localized excitation, Eq.

The leading order terms here\n(those proportional to p2 ) are exactly those derived by Fisch and Boozer.9\nIn order to compute the efficiencies for current drive by a narrow spectrum of waves, it is necessary to\ncarry out the integrations in Eqs. (19) and (20). The following asymptotic series is useful for this purpose:\nZ \u221e\nexp(\u2212 12 y 2 )y n+1 dy = exp(\u2212 21 x2 )[xn + nxn\u22122 + n(n \u2212 2)xn\u22124 + * * *].\nx\n\nFor n even, the series terminates and is exact. The efficiency for current drive by a narrow spectrum of\nLandau-damped waves, Eq. (19) becomes\n4vp2\nHvp\u22121\n6(6 + Z)\nJ\n=\n+\n+\n+ O(vp\u22122 ).\nP\n5+Z\n(5 + Z)(3 + Z) 2 + Z\n\n(31)\n\nFor a narrow spectrum of cyclotron-damped waves, Eq.

The effect of the integrations is to change only the higher-order\nO(vp0 ) corrections to the efficiencies. The leading order terms are the same as for the localized excitation\nEqs. (30). Equations (31) and (32a) are plotted in Fig. 4. These closely approximate the exact results for\nvp > 2vt\n\nVII. HIGH ENERGY LIMIT OF COLLISION OPERATOR\nIn the previous section, we derived finite temperature corrections to the efficiency limit found in\nRef. 2. However, the collision operator in the Landau form Eqs. (1) was derived by assuming that the\nbackground electrons are only weakly relativistic or that \u0398 \u226a 1. We must check, therefore, that the finite\n\u0398 corrections to the Landau operator do not affect the formula for the efficiency limit Eq. (28).\nThe linearized collision operator Eq. (10) consists of three collision terms. Since in all practical cases\nthe ions are nonrelativistic, the ion term C(f, fi ) needs no correction. The term C(fm , f ) contributes to\nthe integral term I(\u03c71 ) in Eq. (17). However, this resulted in a O(\u03983/2 ) contribution to efficiency limit\nEq. (28), so that corrections to this term will be of still higher order.\nTherefore, we need only consider collisions off a Maxwellian electron background C(f, fm ). Furthermore, if \u0398 is small and if p \u226b pt , we may take v \u2032 \u226a v in the full collision kernel Eq. (2) and\napproximate U by its Taylor expansion about v\u2032 = 0. By retaining terms up to second order in v\u2032 , we\nobtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(0)\n2 (0)\n\u2202Ujk vt2\n\u0393 \u2202\n1 \u2202 Ujk 2 \u2202f\n(0) \u2202f\nUjk\nC(f, fm ) =\n+\nvt\nf+\n\u2032 \u2202v \u2032\n2 \u2202pj\n\u2202pk\n\u2202vk\u2032 T\n2 \u2202vm\n\u2202pk\nm\n\nwhere summation over repeated indices is implied and the superscript (0) is used to indicate that U and\nits derivatives are evaluated at v\u2032 = 0. Evaluating these coefficients gives\n(0)\n\nUjk =\n(0)\n\n\u2202Ujk\n\u2202vk\u2032\n\n=\n\nv 2 \u03b4jk \u2212 vj vk\n,\nv3\n2vj\n,\nv3\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n2\nUjk\n1 \u2202 Ujk\n2vj vk\n=\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 4 ) 2 .\n\u2032\n\u2032\n5\n2 \u2202vm \u2202vm\nv\nv\n\n(This calculation was carried out using MACSYMA.22 ) If we compare these with the equivalent expressions using U from Eq. (1c), we find that only the term proportional to \u03b2 4 is new. The high energy form\nof C(f, fm ) is given by Eq. (4a) with A(p) given by Eq. (6a), F (p) = (v/T )A(p), and\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1\nv2\nv4\nB(p) = \u0393\n1 \u2212 t2 1 \u2212 4 .\n2v\nv\nc\nIn other words, in the high-energy limit the electromagnetic correction only changes the pitch-angle\nscattering term. The new term has no effect on the asymptotic form for the efficiencies Eqs. (27) because\nit is smaller by \u03b2 4 than another term in B, which had no effect.\nConnor and Hastie21 also give an expression for collisions of high-energy particles off a fixed background. The corrections to Eq. (6) that they obtain differ from ours. This is possibly because the background distribution that they treat is only approximately Maxwellian.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have considered the problem of current drive by fast waves in a relativistic plasma. Let us briefly\nreview the approximations made. The major one is the reduction of the full collision operator to Landau\n15\n\n\fform. We show in Sec. II that this holds if the background temperature is small, T \u226a mc2 . The\ncorrections to the Landau operator in the high energy limit are derived in Sec. VII and are shown to\nbe small. The second important approximation is the linearization of the electron-electron collision\noperator. This is accurate provided the rf strongly affects only electrons on the tail of the distribution.\nThe subsequent analysis leading to the formula for the current-drive efficiency Eq. (15) is exact. In order\nto apply this formula, it is necessary to determine the rf-induced flux S from Eq. (8) and the Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm\nfunction \u03c7 from Eq. (13).\nWe considered two methods for computing S: either to assume that f = fm in Eq. (8) (corresponding\nto linear damping) or to solve the two-dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck equation, Eq. (22), numerically. The\nlatter method may be necessary in the case of high rf powers and wide spectra. Note that the efficiency\ncan be accurately calculated even if the S is known only approximately since Eq. (15), being an integral\noperator on S, is insensitive to small errors in S. Often, useful information can be extracted from Eq. (15)\neven with very limited information about S. If the rf spectrum is known, we can make some estimates\n(based on either numerical or approximate analytical solutions to the Fokker\u2013Planck equation) of where\nin momentum space the flux is largest. We can then use Eq. (16) to give the efficiency.\nThe Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm function \u03c7 can be determined by solving Eq. (17) numerically as in Sec. V. Since\nthis equation is just a one-dimensional equation, there is little difficulty in obtaining arbitrarily accurate\nresults in this way. This method can be regarded as exact. Alternatively, we found asymptotic forms for \u03c7\nin Sec. VI. From this we can write down analytical expressions for the current-drive efficiency in various\ncases as given in Eqs. (27), (28), (30), (31), and (32).\nThe primary application of this work is, of course, to maintain a steady-state toroidal current in a\ntokamak reactor. The viability of this scheme depends upon the amount of circulating power that is\nrequired. Thus, an accurate calculation of the current-drive efficiency, as well as an assessment of the\nbest possible efficiency, are of crucial importance.\nWhen applying these results to the study of steady-state current drive in a tokamak, it is useful to\nconvert the efficiency J/P to I/W where I = AJ is the total current, W = 2\u03c0RAP is the total rf\npower, A is effective poloidal cross-sectional area, and R is the tokamak major radius. This gives\nI\n1 J\n=\nW\n2\u03c0R P\nJ/P 1020 m\u22123 1 m 15\n= 2.08\nA/W\nq/mc\u03bdc\nn\nR log \u039b\nJ/P 1020 m\u22123 T 1 m 15\nA/W.\n= 40.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\nq/pt \u03bdt\nn\n10 keV R log \u039b\nThe last two equalities give the conversion from the normalized efficiencies given in the figures and in\nSec. VI to practical units. Figures 2, 3, and 4 contain scales in these units.\nThe present work calculates the efficiency that can be expected from an arbitrary wave-induced flux.\nIt is possible, therefore, to come to some very general conclusions about the best possible efficiency that\ncan be obtained by driving currents with different waves. In particular, there is a limit, given by Eq. (28),\nto the efficiency of current drive with fast waves, such as lower-hybrid waves, that interact through a\nLandau resonance with relativistic electrons. These waves are, perhaps, the most likely candidate for\ncurrent drive in a reactor.\nThe present calculations also apply to other types of current drive, for example, relativistic electron\nbeams.29 Here, the efficiencies will be similar to those of Landau-damped waves. Care must be taken,\nhowever, in interpreting experiments on relativistic electron beams because the assumption of a steady\nstate is generally inapplicable.\nThe equations developed here apply to other forms of rf current drive. Some of these may be very\nefficient, more so than lower-hybrid wave-induced fluxes. For example, if low-phase-velocity waves\n16\n\n\finteract through a cyclotron resonance with fast electrons, the rf flux may be nearly parallel to the constant\nenergy contours, at the same time that the collisionality of the resonant electrons is small. This gives very\nhigh efficiency, but, in practice, these waves are much more difficult to generate than are lower-hybrid\nwaves.\nSettling the question of the highest attainable current-drive efficiency with fast waves should enable,\nwe hope, tokamak reactor designers to assess the practicality of using waves to drive steady-state currents.\nThere may, of course, be other effects that present difficulties, such as the accessibility of the waves or\nnonlinear effects. On the other hand, there may be effects, such as the bootstrap current, which could be\nhelpful.\nFinally, we hope that the form that we derived here for the relativistic collision operator, which\nenabled us to solve for the relativistic Spitzer\u2013H\u00e4rm function, will be of use in other numerical problems\ndealing with collisions in hot plasmas.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the United States Department of Energy under Contract DE\u2013AC02\u201376\u2013\nCHO\u20133073.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nN.
