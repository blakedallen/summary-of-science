Among these applications are quantum computation [1], quantum teleportation, and quantum cryptography. In recent years, much attention has been paid\nto continuous variable quantum information processing\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,\n19, 20] in which continuous-variable-type entangled pure\nstates play a key role. For instance, two-state entangled coherent states (ECS) are used to realize efficient\nquantum computation [7] and quantum teleportation [8].\nTwo-mode squeezed vacuum states have been applied to\nquantum dense coding [9]. In particular, following the\ntheoretical proposal of Ref. [10], continuous variable teleportation has been experimentally demonstrated for coherent states of a light field [11] by using entangled twomode squeezed vacuum states. Therefore, it is an interesting topic to create and apply continuous-variable-type\nentangled pure states. On the other hand, a coherent\nstate is the simplest continuous-variable state. Based on\ncoherent states, two types of continuous-variable states,\ncalled photon-added coherent states [21] and entangled\ncoherent states [22], have been introduced and shown to\nhave wide applications in both quantum physics [23] and\nquantum information processing [7, 8, 20, 24]. In a previous paper [25], single-mode excited entangled coherent\nstates (SMEECSs) are introduced. It has been shown\nthat the SMEECSs form a type of cyclic representation\nof the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra and exhibit rich entanglement properties. The purpose of this paper is to propose the concept of two-mode excited entangled coherent\nstates (TMEECSs), study their preparation and entanglement properties. This paper is organized as follows.\nIn Sec. II, we present the definition of the TMEECSs and\ndiscuss their preparation. In Sec. III, we study entanglement character of the TMEECSs and compare them\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor. Email: lmkuang@hunnu.edu.cn\n\nwith the SMEECSs. We shall conclude this paper with\ndiscussions and remarks in the last section.\nII.\n\nTWO-MODE EXCITED ENTANGLED\nCOHERENT STATES AND THEIR\nPREPARATION\n\nIn this section we introduce the definition of the\nTMEECSs and present a possible scheme of producing\nthem from the SMEECSs through atom-field interaction.\nLet us begin with the following two-mode entangled coherent states (ECSs)\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, 0)i = A\u00b1 (\u03b1, 0)(|\u03b1, \u03b1i \u00b1 | \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212\u03b1i),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |\u03b1, \u03b1i = |\u03b1i \u2297 |\u03b1i with |\u03b1i = D(\u03b1)|0i being the\nusual Glauber coherent state defined by the action of the\ndisplacement operator D(\u03b1) = exp(\u03b1\u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u00e2) upon the\nvacuum state |0i. The normalization constants are given\nby\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\nA\u22122\n(2)\n\u00b1 (\u03b1, 0) = 2 1 \u00b1 exp(\u22124|\u03b1| ) .\nFor convenience, we denote the first and second modes\nin two-mode ECSs given by Eq. (1) by modes a and b,\nrespectively. Then for the ECSs we consider m-photon\nexcitations in mode a and n-photon excitations in mode\na with m 6= 0 and n 6= 0, respectively, and introduce the\nTMEECSs defined by\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i = N\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)\u00e2\u2020m b\u0302\u2020m (|\u03b1, \u03b1i \u00b1 | \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212\u03b1i),\n(3)\nwhere \u00e2\u2020 and b\u0302\u2020 are the creation operators of the modes\na and b, respectively. It is straight forward to calculate\nthe normalization constants in Eq. (3) with the following\nexpressions\n\u0002\nN\u00b1\u22122 (\u03b1, m, n) = 2m!n! Lm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )Ln (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )\ni\n2\n\u00b1e\u22124|\u03b1| Lm (|\u03b1|2 )Ln (|\u03b1|2 ) , (4)\nwhere Lm (x) is a Laguerre polynomials of order m defined by\nLm (x) =\n\nm\nX\n(\u22121)n m!xn\n.\n(n!)2 (m \u2212 n)!\nn=0\n\n(5)\n\n\f2\nIn the derivation of the Eq. (4) we have used the following\nexpressions\nh\u03b1|\u00e2m \u00e2\u2020m |\u03b1i = m!Lm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ),\n2\n\nN \u22122 (\u03b1, m) = m!Lm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ).\n\nh\u03b1|\u00e2m \u00e2\u2020m | \u2212 \u03b1i = m!e\u22122|\u03b1| Lm (|\u03b1|2 ),\n\n(m 6= 0). (6)\n\nIf we introduce the following normalized states with\nrespect to mode a and mode b\n|a(\u00b1\u03b1, m)i = N (\u03b1, m)\u00e2\u2020m | \u00b1 \u03b1i,\n|b(\u00b1\u03b1, m)i = N (\u03b1, m)b\u0302\u2020m | \u00b1 \u03b1i,\n\nM2\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n) =\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nThen the TMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i in terms of four\nnormalized states can be rewritten as\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i = M\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)[|a(\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |b(\u03b1, n)i\n\u00b1|a(\u2212\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |b(\u2212\u03b1, n)i],\n(9)\nwhere the normalization constants are given by\n\nLm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )Ln (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )\n\u0002\n\u0003.\n2 Lm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )Ln (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u00b1 e\u22124|\u03b1|2 Lm (|\u03b1|2 )Ln (|\u03b1|2 )\n\nWe now present a possible scheme to produce them\nfrom the two mode ECSs through atom-field interaction.\nConsider an interaction between a two-level atom with\na cavity field. The atom makes a transition from the\nexcited state |ei to the ground state |gi by emitting a\nphoton. In the interaction picture, the Hamiltonian of\nresonant interaction is given by\n\u0124 = \u03c3\u0302+ b\u0302 + g \u2217 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 b\u0302\u2020 ,\n\nwhere the normalized coefficients are given by\n\n(10)\n\nof the two optical fields is reduced to the TMEECS\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, 1)i given by Eq. (3). If we consider a succession of m atoms through the cavity and if we detect\nall the atoms in the ground state |gi, then the state of\nthe two optical fields is reduced to the desired state, the\nTMEECS with (m + n)-photon excitations. Hence, we\ncan, in principle, produce the TMEECS |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i.\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302+ and \u03c3\u0302\u2212 are Pauli operator corresponding to the\ntwo-level atom, b\u0302\u2020 and b\u0302 are the creation and annihilation\noperator of the field mode b, g is the coupling constant.\nSuppose that the atom is initially in the excited state\nand the two field modes is initially in the SMEECS with\nm photon excitations (m 6= 0) given by\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i = N\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)\u00e2\u2020m (|\u03b1, \u03b1i \u00b1 | \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212\u03b1i), (12)\nwhere the normalization constant is given by\nh\ni\n2\n\u22122\nN\u00b1\n(\u03b1, m) = 2m! Lm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u00b1 e\u22122|\u03b1| Lm (|\u03b1|2 ) , (13)\nwhere Lm (x) is m-th Laguerre polynomial defined in Eq.\n(5).\nSuppose that only the mode b interacts with the atom.\nThen for the weak coupling case, the state of the atomfield system at time t can be approximated by\n|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |ei \u2212 i\u0124t|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |ei, (14)\nwhich is approximately valid for interaction times such\nthat gt \u226a 1. Making use of Eq. (11), one can reduce\n(14) to\n|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |ei \u2212 i(g \u2217 t)b\u0302\u2020 |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m)i \u2297 |gi,\n(15)\nwhich indicates that if the atom is detected to be in\nthe ground state |gi, then after normalization the state\n\nIII.\n\nTHE ENTANGLEMENT AMOUNT OF\nTMEECS\n\nIn this section, we calculate the amount of entanglement of the TMEECSs and investigate the influence\nof the photon excitations on the entanglement of the\nTMEECSs. From Eq. (9) we can see that the TMEECSs\nare two-component entangled states. The degree of quantum entanglement of the two-state entangled states can\nbe measured in terms of the concurrence [12, 24, 28]\nwhich is generally defined for discrete-variable entangled\nstates to be [28]\nC = |h\u03a8|\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y |\u03a8\u2217 i|,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere |\u03a8\u2217 i is the complex conjugate of |\u03a8i. The concurrence equals one for a maximally entangled state.\nFor continuous-variables-type entangled states like (9),\nwe consider a general bipartite entangled state\n|\u03c8i = \u03bc|\u03b7i \u2297 |\u03b3i + \u03bd|\u03bei \u2297 |\u03b4i,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere |\u03b7i and |\u03bei are normalized states of subsystem 1\nand |\u03b3i and |\u03b4i normalized states of subsystem 2 with\ncomplex \u03bc and \u03bd. Through transforming continuousvariables-type components to discrete orthogonal basis\nand making use of a Schmidt decomposition [29], it is\nfound the concurrence of the entangled state (17) to be\n\n\f3\nC\u00b1 (\u03b1, m + k, n) = C\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n + k),\n\ngiven by the following expression [12, 30]\np\n2|\u03bc||\u03bd| (1 \u2212 |p1 |2 )(1 \u2212 |p2 |2 )\nC =\n,\n|\u03bc|2 + |\u03bd|2 + 2Re(\u03bc\u2217 \u03bdp1 p\u22172 )\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the two overlapping functions are defined by\np1 = h\u03b7|\u03bei,\n\np2 = h\u03b4|\u03b3i.\n\n(19)\n\nFor the case of the no-photon excitation ECSs defined\nin Eq. (1), making use of Eqs. (1) and (2) from Eqs.\n(18)-(19) we can find that the concurrence is given by\n2\n\nC\u2212 (\u03b1, 0) = 1,\n\nC+ (\u03b1, 0) =\n\n1 \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1|\n,\n1 + e\u22124|\u03b1|2\n\n(20)\n\nwhich implies that the degree of entanglement of the ECS\n|\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, 0)i is independent of the state parameter \u03b1, and\nit is a maximally entangled state while the amount of\nentanglement of the ECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, 0)i is less than that of\nthe ECS |\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, 0)i. The concurrence C+ (\u03b1, 0) increases\nwith |\u03b1|2 , and the state |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, 0)i approaches the maximally entangled coherent state with C+ (\u03b1, 0) \u2248 1 for the\nstrong filed case of the large |\u03b1|2 .\nWhen there exist photon excitations for both modes,\ni.e., m 6= 0 and n 6= 0, the TMEECSs are given by Eqs.\n(3) and (9). From Eqs. (18) and (19) we find the corresponding concurrence to be\np\n(1 \u2212 |p1 (\u03b1, m)|2 )(1 \u2212 |p2 (\u03b1, n)|2 )\nC\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n) =\n,\n1 \u00b1 p1 (\u03b1, m)p2 (\u03b1, n)\n(21)\nwhere the two overlapping functions are given by\nLm (|\u03b1|2 )\n,\nLm (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )\n2\n2 Ln (|\u03b1| )\np2 (\u03b1, n) = e\u22122|\u03b1|\n.\nLn (\u2212|\u03b1|2 )\n\np1 (\u03b1, m) = e\u22122|\u03b1|\n\n2\n\n(22)\n\nFrom Eqs. (21-22) we can see that the TMEECSs exhibit the exchanging symmetry with respect to the exchange of two-mode photon excitations\nC\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n) = C\u00b1 (\u03b1, n, m),\n\nC+ (\u03b1, 2m) =\n\nh\u0010\n\n1 \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1|\n\n2\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nwhere k is an arbitrary non-negative integer. Eq. (23) indicates that the allotment of photon excitations between\ntwo modes does not affect the entanglement amount of\nthe TMEECSs when the total number of photon excitations are fixed.\nIn order to observe the influence of the photon excitations on the quantum entanglement of the TMEECS\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i, we consider the case of m = n in which\nthere are the same photon excitations in each filed modes\nof the TMEECS.\nFirstly, let us consider the TMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m, m)i.\nIn this case we find the corresponding concurrence to be\n1 \u2212 p21 (\u03b1, m)\n,\n(24)\n1 + p21 (\u03b1, m)\nwhich indicates that the amount of entanglement of the\nTMEECS |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, m)i decreases with the increase of\nthe overlapping function |p1 (\u03b1, m)|. In the weak field\nregime of |\u03b1|2 \u226a 1, we have Lm (|\u03b1|2 ) \u2248 1 \u2212 m|\u03b1|2 . Then\nfrom Eqs. (22) and (24) we can get\nC+ (\u03b1, m, m) =\n\nC+ (\u03b1, m, m) \u2248 (1 + m)|\u03b1|2 ,\n\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, 2m)i = N\u00b1 (\u03b1, 2m)\u00e2\u20202m (|\u03b1, \u03b1i \u00b1 | \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212\u03b1i),\n(26)\nwhere the normalization constants Eq. (3) are given by\nh\ni\n2\nN\u00b1\u22122 (\u03b1, 2m) = 4m! L2m (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u00b1 e\u22124|\u03b1| L2m (|\u03b1|2 ) .\n(27)\nThe concurrence of the SMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, 2m)i is given\nby the following expression\n\nL22m (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) + e\u22124|\u03b1|2 L22m (|\u03b1|2 )\n\nwhich indicates that the photon excitation can enhance\n\n(25)\n\nwhich implies that the concurrence increases with the increase of the two-mode photon excitations. Hence in the\nweak field regime the photon excitation can enhance the\nentanglement amount for the TMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m, m)i.\nIt would be interesting to compare entanglement character of the TMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m, m)i which contains 2m\nphoton excitations that of the SMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, 2m)i\nwhich involves 2m photon excitations as well. The\nSMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, 2m)i with m 6= 0 [25] are defined by\n\n\u0011i1/2\n2\nL22m (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1| L22m (|\u03b1|2 )\n\nwhich implies that in the weak field regime of |\u03b1|2 \u226a 1,\nwe can get\n\u221a\n(29)\nC+ (\u03b1, 2m) = 1 + 2m|\u03b1|2 ,\n\n(23)\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nthe entanglement amount for the SMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m)i.\nIn particular, when |\u03b1|2 \u226a 1, we have C+ (\u03b1, 2m) \u226a\n1. Therefore, in the weak field regime the TMEECS\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, m)i exhibits similar entanglement character to\nthat of the SMEECS |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m)i.\n\n\f4\nSecondly, we consider the TMEECS |\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, m, m)i. In\nthis case the corresponding concurrence is found to be\nC\u2212 (\u03b1, m, m) = 1,\n\n(30)\n\nwhich implies that the TMEECS |\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, m, m)i is al-\n\nC\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m) =\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011i1/2\nh\u0010\n2\n2\nL22m (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1| L22m (|\u03b1|2 )\n1 \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1|\nL22m (\u2212|\u03b1|2 ) \u2212 e\u22124|\u03b1|2 L22m (|\u03b1|2 )\n\nIn the weak field regime of |\u03b1|2 \u226a 1, we find that\n1\nC\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m) \u2248 \u221a\n,\n1 + 2m\n\n(32)\n\nwhich indicates that the concurrence C\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m) decreases\nwith the increase of the photon excitation number 2m.\nIn particular, when m \u226b 1 we have C\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m) \u226a 1.\nHence, the photon excitation suppresses the amount of\nentanglement for the the SMEECS |\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m)i in the\nweak field regime.\nIV.\n\nways a maximally entangled state and 2m photon excitations do not affect the entanglement amount of the state.\nThis property is very different from that of the SMEECS\n|\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m)i defined in Eq. (26). The concurrence of the\nSMEECS |\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, 2m)i is given by\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have proposed two types of TMEECSs\n|\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i, studied their entanglement characteristics, and investigated the influence of photon\nexcitations on quantum entanglement. We have indicated it is possible to produce such states by using\ncavity QED and quantum measurements. It is found\nthat the two TMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, n)i exhibit quite\ndifferent entanglement properties. In particular, for the\nstate |\u03a8+ (\u03b1, m, m)i the two-mode photon excitations\naffect seriously entanglement character, and the entan-\n\n[1] Nielsen M A and Chuang I L 2000 Quantum Computation and Quantum Information(Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press)\n[2] Cerf N J, Leuchs G, and Polzik E S 2007 Quantum Information with Continuous Variables of Atoms and Light\n(London: Imperial Collegae Press)\n[3] Su X, Tan A, Jia X, Zhang J, Xie C, and Peng K 2007\nPhys.

However, the state\n|\u03a8\u2212 (\u03b1, m, m)i is always a maximally entangled state,\nthe two-mode photon excitations does not change the\namount entanglement of the state. We have also made\ncomparisons between the TMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, m)i and\nthe SMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, 2m)i. It has been shown that\ntwo-mode photon excitations have more advantages\nthan single-mode photon excitations such as the entanglement amount of the TMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, m, m)i is\nlarger than that of the SMEECSs |\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b1, 2m)i for the\nsame photon excitation number 2m. This approach of\nenhancing entanglement by using two-mode excitations\nof continuous-variable quantum sates opens a new way\nto create new entanglement resources with continuous\nvariables.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the National Fundamental Research Program Grant No. 2007CB925204, the\nNational Natural Science Foundation under Grant Nos.\n10775048 and 10325523, the Foundation of the Education Ministry of China, and the Education Committee of\nHunan Provinceunder Grant No. 08W012.\n\n[9] Ban M 1999 J.
