In the MS scheme at \u03bc = 2 GeV,\nfrom the GMOR formula we obtain hq\u0304qi = \u2212 (273 \u00b1 19 MeV)3 . We show that the\nvalue extracted from the pseudoscalar vertex, hq\u0304qi = \u2212 (312 \u00b1 24 MeV)3 , although\nlarger, is consistent with the result obtained from the first (standard) method.\n\n1\n\nMotivation\n\nThe value of the quark condensate was, and still is, a subject of some controversies. It\nhas been experimentally established that in the theory with the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking pattern SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R \u2192 SU(2)V , the quark condensate is indeed the order\nparameter [1]. The extension to the three flavour case still needs to be clarified (for a\nrecent critical discussion see ref. [2]). Lattice QCD provides, in principle, the method\nfor determining the value of the quark condensate and for studying its dependence on the\nnumber of dynamical quark flavours. Up to now, the determination of the quark condensate\non the lattice was limited to the quenched QCD (i.e. with nF = 0). 2 Before tackling the\ntheory with nF = 2 and nF = 3 flavors, one would like to learn as much as possible from\nthe quenched theory. For example, one would like to understand if the values of the chiral\ncondensate obtained by using different methods are consistent among themselves.\n1\n2\n\nUnit\u00e9 mixte de Recherche du CNRS - UMR 8627.\nSee ref. [3] for recent results and the exhaustive list of references.\n\n\fThe standard method relies on the use of the GMOR formula, i.e. on the same set of\nthe background gauge field configurations one computes both the quark masses (mq ) and\nthe corresponding pseudoscalar meson masses (mP ), and from the slope\nm2P = 2B0 mq ,\n\n(1)\n\none gets an estimate of the quark condensate as\nB0 = \u2212\n\n2\nhq\u0304qi ,\nf2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit. The renormalization scale and\nscheme dependence of the chiral condensate is just the inverse of the one for the quark\nmass which was discussed in great detail in ref. [4].\nAn alternative way for extracting the value of the quark condensate is from the study\nof the amputated pseudoscalar vertex function, where the q\u0304\u03b35 q operator is inserted at\nmomentum zero. At moderately large p2 (p being the momentum flowing through the legs\nof the vertex function), one can compare the shape of this function with the corresponding\nexpression derived by means of the operator product expansion (OPE), in which the quark\ncondensate appears in the coefficient of the leading power correction. The lattice estimate\nbased on this strategy, which is the purpose of this letter, has not been presented so far.\nWe show that its value in the continuum limit is fully consistent with the standard value,\nobtained by using the GMOR formula, whose value we updated here as well.\n\n2\n\nPseudoscalar vertex\n\nIn this section we discuss the relation between the pseudoscalar vertex and the quark\npropagator and study the dependence of these functions on the chiral quark condensate,\nwhich enters their OPE as a leading power correction.\nThe starting point is to define the quark propagator and the Green function of the\npseudoscalar density with zero momentum insertion,\nZ\nZ\n\u2212ipx\nS(p) = dx e\nhq(x)q\u0304(0)i , GP (p) = dx dy e\u2212ip(x\u2212y) hq(x) q\u0304(0)\u03b35 q(0) q\u0304(y)i . (3)\nThe amputated vertex function,\n\u039bP (p) = S \u22121 (p)GP (p)S \u22121 (p) ,\n\n(4)\n\nis then conveniently projected onto its tree level value\n\u0393P (p) =\n\n1\nTr [\u03b35 \u039bP (p)] ,\n12\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the trace goes over Dirac and color indices so that the factor 1/12 simply provides\nthe normalization to unity.\n2\n\n\fIf we write the bare (lattice regularized) inverse quark propagator as\nS \u22121 (p) = \u03a31 (p2 )p/ + \u03a32 (p2 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nthen the basic RI/MOM renormalization condition for the quark propagator in the chiral\nlimit can be written as [6] 3\n1 Tr p/S \u22121 (p2 )\n1\n\u00d7\nZq (\u03bc2 ) 12\np2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2261\np2 =\u03bc2\n\n\u03a31 (p2 )\nZq (\u03bc2 )\n\n= 1,\n\n(7)\n\np2 =\u03bc2\n\nb \u03bc) = Zq (\u03bc)S(p)).\nwhere Zq (\u03bc) is the quark field renormalization (S(p,\nBy studying the quark propagator at large momenta, one can get an estimate of the\nquark mass value, in the RI/MOM scheme, as\nmRI/MOM\n(\u03bc2 ) =\nq\n\nh\ni\n1\nTr Sb\u22121 (p, \u03bc)\n=\n12\np2 =\u03bc2\n\n\u03a32 (p2 )\n\u03a31 (p2 )\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\np2 =\u03bc2\n\nThis estimate has been already discussed in ref. [8]. At lower momenta, however, this\ndefinition of the quark mass suffers from the presence of the long distance contributions\ndue to the coupling to the Goldstone bosons.\nThe effect of the Goldstone boson is more clearly seen by considering the quark Ward\nidentity which relates the inverse quark propagator to the amputated pseudoscalar Green\nfunction,\n\u03b35 S \u22121 (p2 ) + S \u22121 (p2 )\u03b35 = 2ZA \u03c1 \u039bP (p2 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ZA \u03c1 is the quark mass obtained from the hadronic axial Ward identity on the\nlattice. 4 After multiplying eq. (9) by \u03b35 and by taking the trace of both sides, we have\n\u03a32 (p2 ) = ZA \u03c1 \u0393P (p2 ) .\n\n(10)\n\nFor light quark masses and moderately large momenta, the vertex function \u0393P (p2 ) is affected by the long distance effects which are due to the presence of the Goldstone boson [5],\nwhich by means of the LSZ reduction formula generates the term proportional to the Goldstone boson propagator 1/(q 2 + m2\u03c0 ). Since the operator is inserted at zero momentum,\nq 2 = 0, the vertex function in the chiral limit developes a pole \u221d 1/m2\u03c0 \u223c 1/\u03c1. To account\nfor that effect, we expand the vertex function in powers of the quark mass,\n2\n\n\u0393P (p , \u03c1) =\n\n\u0393subtr.\n(p2 )\nP\n\nB(p2 )\n+\n+ C(p2 )\u03c1 ,\nZA \u03c1\n\n3\n\n(11)\n\nIn practice, we are away from the chiral limit, but the renormalization condition applies equally well\nfor m2q /p2 \u226a 1 [7].\nX\nX\n4\nRecall that 2\u03c1 = \u22020 h A0 (x)P (0)i/h P (x)P (0)i, with P = q\u0304\u03b35 q, A0 = q\u0304\u03b30 \u03b35 q, and ZA \u2261 ZA (g02 )\n~\nx\n\n~\nx\n\nis the (known) axial current renormalization constant.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere the first term is the subtracted pseudoscalar vertex, from which the hadronic (Goldstone boson) contribution \u221d 1/m2P \u221d 1/\u03c1 is subtracted away. The third term is the linear\nquark mass correction while the higher order terms in the expansion, as well as the logarithmic quark mass dependence, are neglected since we deal with light quark masses varying\nin a short interval.\nRI/MOM\nThe renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar density, ZP\n(\u03bc), is defined in\nterms of the subtracted Green function of eq. (11) through the RI/MOM renormalization\ncondition\nZP (\u03bc2 ) subtr. 2\n\u0393\n(p )\nZq (\u03bc2 ) P\n\n= 1.\n\n(12)\n\np2 =\u03bc2\nRI/MOM\n\nAs we already discussed in ref. [4], the value of ZP\n(\u03bc) obtained from eq. (12) is\ncompletely consistent with the one obtained by applying the method of ref. [9], which\nallows one to circumvent the second term on the r.h.s. of eq. (11).\nAfter inserting eq. (11) in (10), multiplying both sides by Zq\u22121 (\u03bc), and accounting for\nthe renormalization condition (12), we have\n\u03a32 (p2 )\n\u03a31 (p2 )\n\n=\np2 =\u03bc2\n\nB(p2 )\nZA \u03c1\n+\n,\nZP (\u03bc2 )\nZq (\u03bc2 )\n| {z }\nRI/MOM\n\nmAWI\n\n(13)\n\n(\u03bc)\n\nwhere contributions quadratic in the quark mass have been neglected. The first term on\nthe right-hand side is the usual short distance quark mass, renormalized in the RI/MOM\nscheme, derived from the axial Ward identity. Equation 13 differs from eq. (8) for the presence of the second term on the r.h.s., which represents the power suppressed contribution\ncoming from the Goldstone boson. It has been shown long ago that, at the leading order\nin the OPE, this term has the form [10]\nB(p2 )\n\u03a31 (p2 )\n\n= c(p2 , \u03bc)\nOPE\n\n\u0001\nhq\u0304qi(\u03bc)\n4\n+\nO\n1/p\n.\np2\n\n(14)\n\nFrom this relation we will derive our first estimate of the quark condensate.\nThe Wilson coefficient, c(p2 , \u03bc), has been computed at the next-to-leading order (NLO)\nin QCD perturbation theory [11].

More complete information about the datasets, as well as the improvement coefficients with the appropriate list of references can\nbe found in refs. [4, 12]. Since we work at four different lattice spacings, we are able\nto extrapolate to the continuum limit. To eliminate the lattice spacing from the results\nobtained at each lattice coupling, we use the ratio a/r0 computed in ref. [13],\n(a/r0 )\u03b2 = {0.18636.0 , 0.13546.2, 0.10276.4 , 0.09626.45 } ,\n\n(19)\n\nso that all our results will be expressed in units of the scale r0 . To convert into physical\nunits we will use r0 = 0.530(25) fm, which corresponds to a\u22121\n\u03b2=6.0 = 2.0(1) GeV. We will\nnF =0\nalso need the quenched value of \u039bQCD , for which we take r0 \u039bMS = 0.602(48) [14]. 6\n\n3.1\n\nhq\u0304qi from the pseudoscalar vertex\n\nIn order to determine the chiral condensate from the long distance behavior of the pseudoscalar vertex, we first need to extract the function B(p2 ). That is made by using 10\ndifferent vertex functions, 4 of which are computed with the external legs degenerate in\nthe quark mass, and 6 nondegenerate. With these 10 points, for each p2 , we fit the data\nto the form (11), which we rewrite as\n\u0393P (p2 , \u03c1i , \u03c1j ) = \u0393Psubtr.

We see that the presence\nof the Goldstone pole is indeed pronounced at moderately large values of p2 .\nOnce we identify the Goldstone contribution to the psudoscalar vertex, we perform a\nnumber of fits to the form\nhq\u0304qiRGI\n\u03b3\nB(p2 )\nRGI\n=\nc\n(p)\n+ 4 + \u03b4 + \u03bbp2 ,\n2\n2\n\u03a31 (p )\np\np\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the first term on the r.h.s. is the one that we are interested in (the coefficient cRGI is\ndefined in eq. (18)), the second term is the subleading power correction, while the last two\nterms take into account possible contributions of lattice artifacts. To make use of the OPE\nformula we should aim at working at sufficiently large p2 so that higher powers in 1/p2 are\nsufficiently suppressed. To do so, we fit the lattice data starting from pcut \u2248 2 GeV, which\ncorresponds to (r0 pcut )2 \u2248 25, for which the radiative correction term in cRGI (p) is below\n35%. If we set \u03b3 = \u03b4 = \u03bb = 0 in (21), then for all our lattices we have \u03c72 /d.o.f. > 2.\nTherefore one has to let free at least one more parameter. The result of such a fit with\n\u03b3 6= 0 is presented in table 1 and denoted as fit I (see also fig. 2 for illustration). At fixed\nlattice spacing, however, the lattice artifacts may be significant. To examine their impact\non the value of the quark condensate, we repeat the fits by including either the term with\np2 (\u221d \u03bb) or the constant one (\u221d \u03b4). Both sets of results are reported in table 1, labelled as\nfit II and fit III, respectively. Finally, if we set pcut & 3 GeV, the fit with \u03b3 = \u03b4 = \u03bb = 0\ngives a satisfactory \u03c72 /d.o.f. The corresponding results are denoted as fit IV in table 1.\nWe also tried to fit with all the parameters in eq.

Various fit forms (labelled as I, II, III, IV\nand V) are discussed in the text.\nThe remaining step towards the determination of the quark condensate is the extrapolation to the continuum limit. Since our action and the renormalization constants are\n\n8\n\n\fO(a)-improved, we may attempt extrapolating quadratically in the lattice spacing, i.e.\n\u0002\n\u00031/3\nr0 hq\u0304qiRGI \u03b2 = C0 + C1 (a/r0 )2\u03b2 .\n\n(22)\n\nOur result for C0 , the chiral condensate in the continuum limit, for all four fit forms\ndiscussed above, are\n\u0002\n\u00031/3\nr0 hq\u0304qiRGI cont. = {\u22120.721(23)I , \u22120.681(28)II , \u22120.672(34)III , \u22120.792(24)IV , , \u22120.54(15)V } .(23)\n\nOne may argue that terms of O(a) may still be present, since the function B(p2 ) is obtained\nfrom the off-shell vertex functions \u0393P (p2 , \u03c1i , \u03c1j ), for which the on-shell O(a) improvement\ndoes not apply. However, the function B(p2 ) refers to the chiral limit, and terms in \u0393P (p2 , \u03c1)\nproportional to the quark mass are already taken care of in the fit to the form (11). In\naddition, it has been shown in appendix of ref. [4] that, for these correlation functions, the\nO(a) contribution of operators which are either non gauge-invariant or vanish on-shell by\nthe equation of motion vanish in the chiral limit. Therefore, while the O(a) effects may\naffect the functions \u0393subtr. (p2 ) and C(p2 ) in eq. (20) when away from the chiral limit, the\nfunction B(p2 ) is polluted by the artefacts O(a2 ) and higher. This brings us back to the\ncontinuum extrapolation form (22).\nWhat do we learn from the results (23) in the continuum limit? As it can be seen\nfrom table 1, the corrections \u221d 1/p4 are large and positive for every \u03b2. Their neglect in\nthe fit IV then expectedly lead to an overestimate of the value for the chiral condensate,\nas confirmed by the last number in eq. (23). Fits II and III give quite consistent values\nfor the condensate (in the a \u2192 0 limit). In other words, the quark condensate in the\ncontinuum limit is very weakly sensitive to the form of the artifacts that we include in our\nfits (constant or \u221d p2 ). The tendency of the artifacts, upon their inclusion in the fit, is to\nlower the value of the condensate. The same tendency is observed also in the fit form V,\nalthough with larger error bars.\nAs our final value we will quote the result of the fit I. The difference between the central\nvalue of that and the fits obtained by including the artifacts (II and III) is included in the\nsystematic uncertainty. The result of the fit V has larger errors and is consistent with the\nresults obtained by other fits. As we already pointed out, the radiative corrections are large\nand we take them into account when fitting the lattice data to eq. (21). To account for\nthe systematics induced by the omission of higher order corrections in \u03b1S (p), we will add\n\u00b110% of uncertainty (which represents the square of the 30% effect of the known radiative\ncorrections at p = 3 GeV). Finally we have 7\nhq\u0304qiRGI = \u2212 269 \u00b1 9+00\n\u221218 \u00b1 12 MeV\n\u21d4\n\u21d2\n\nhq\u0304qi\n\nRGI\n\nhq\u0304qi\n\nMS\n\n\u00013\n\n\u00b1 10%\n\n3\n\n= \u2212 (260 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 12 MeV) \u00b1 10%\n\n(2 GeV) = \u2212 (312 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 15 \u00b1 10 MeV)3 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the errors are respectively: statistical, systematics due to the continuum extrapolation, to the uncertainty in r0 and to the uncertainty due to N2 LO corrections in the\n7\n\nWe remind the reader that r0 = 0.530(25) fm, is equivalent to r0 = 2.68(13) GeV\u22121 .\n\n9\n\n\fWilson coefficient cRGI (p) [see eq.

Notice that in the second line we symmetrised the\nsystematic error bars.\nFinally, we repeated the entire exercise by using the alternative quark mass definition,\nnamely the one derived from the vector Ward identity, mq = 12 (1/\u03baq \u2212 1/\u03bacrit ), instead of\nthe quark mass ZA \u03c1, used above.

(1) and (2) for all four lattice spacings. We also present\nthe results of the linear extrapolation in a2 to the continuum limit (a \u2192 0).\nWe now repeat the standard exercise of extracting the value of the quark condensate\nby employing the GMOR formula. The values of the pseudoscalar meson and the quark\nmasses are all listed in table 2 of ref. [12]. In table 2 of the present letter, we give the\nresults obtained by using eqs. (1) and (2), where we use for the quark mass the one\ndefined via the axial Ward identity (\u03c1). The needed renormalization constants, ZA and\nRI/MOM\nZP\n(1/a), are given in ref. [4]. For completeness, we also present the values of the\n(improved) pseudoscalar meson decay constant in the chiral limit, f , which is obtained by\nlinearly extrapolating in the quark masses (fP = f + const. \u00d7 \u03c1). To convert the quark\ncondensate from the RI/MOM scheme to the RGI form, we use the anomalous dimension\nknown up to 4-loops [15]. These latter results are then extrapolated to the continuum limit\nlinearly in a2 [see eq. (22)]. In physical units, our results read\nhq\u0304qiRGI = \u2212 (224 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 10 MeV)3 \u21d2 hq\u0304qiMS (2 GeV) = \u2212 (273 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 15 MeV)3 . (25)\nWe checked that this value is completely consistent with the alternative definition of the\nRI/MOM\nquark mass, namely with mq = 12 (1/\u03baq \u2212 1/\u03bacrit ), and with ZS\n(1/a) also given in\n9\nref. [4]. Finally we also note that the above result agrees very well with the QCD sum\nrule estimate of ref. [16], where hq\u0304qiMS (2 GeV) = \u2212 (267 \u00b1 16 MeV)3 has been quoted.\n3\n\n8\n\nMore specifically, with mq instead of \u03c1, we get hq\u0304qiMS (2 GeV) = \u2212 (313 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 13 \u00b1 15 \u00b1 10 MeV) .\nWhen using the quark mass defined via the vector Ward identity instead of the axial one, we get\n3\nMS\nhq\u0304qi (2 GeV) = \u2212 (268 \u00b1 13 \u00b1 15 MeV) .\n9\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nSummary and conclusion\n\nWe now briefly summarize our findings and comment on some results reported in the\nliterature.\n(1) We update the value of the chiral condensate obtained from quenched QCD on the\nlattice, by using the GMOR formula. After combining the errors given in eq. (25) in the\nquadrature, we have\n3\nhq\u0304qiMS\nGMOR (2 GeV) = \u2212 (273 \u00b1 19 MeV) .\n\n(26)\n\nThis result is obtained from simulations performed at four lattice spacings, by employing\nnon-perturbative renormalization and O(a)-improvement, followed by an extrapolation to\nthe continuum limit.\n(2) We compute the quark condensate by using an alternative strategy, namely by studying the long distance (Goldstone) part of the pseudoscalar vertex function. In terms of\nthe OPE, the chiral condensate appears in the coefficient of the leading power correction in 1/p2. From the calculations at four lattice spacings and after extrapolating to the\ncontinuum limit we obtain\n3\nhq\u0304qiMS\nOPE (2 GeV) = \u2212 (312 \u00b1 24 MeV) .\n\n(27)\n\n(3) From the above results, it seems that the two completely different strategies lead to\nquite a consistent value of the quark condensate. To better appreciate this point we rewrite\nthe RGI results in units of r0 , i.e.,\n\u2212r0 [hq\u0304qiRGI ]1/3 = {0.701(23)(20)(23)OPE, 0.601(25)GMOR } .\n\n(28)\n\nThe method based on using OPE is less reliable since radiative and further power corrections are large. Even if we combine the errors in quadrature the agreement would be at the\n2\u03c3-level, which is far from what has been claimed in ref. [5], where the OPE and GMOR\nresults were argued to differ by a factor of 3.\nBefore closing this letter, we should explain why our conclusion is qualitatively different\nfrom the one reported in ref. [5]. The first difference is that in eq. (11), besides the\nGoldstone term (\u221d 1/\u03c1) we also allow for the presence of the term linear in quark mass.\nSuch a term could not be studied in ref. [5] since only three quark masses were considered.\nThe net effect of this modification is that the function B(p2 ) becomes smaller. Secondly,\nin the OPE, we allow for the presence of the term \u221d 1/p4 , and we find that, for moderately\nlarge momenta, this (subleading) power correction is not negligible, while in ref. [5] such\na term was not found. Finally, we also accounted for the terms that are due to the lattice\nartifacts [see eq. (22)], which further reduce the value of the condensate in the continuum\nlimit. Such effects were not studied in ref. [5] (where they only considered the data produced\nat \u03b2 = 6.0). Notice also that the reference value of the chiral condensate considered in\nref. [5], was 20% smaller than the one we obtain here by using the GMOR formula.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nWe wish to thank our collaborators of ref.
