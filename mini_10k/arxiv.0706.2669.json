We use data from the Pierre\nAuger Observatory up to March, 2007. Present analyzes are therefore based on a substantially larger data\nset than our previous published results. A limit on the flux coming from a hypothetical point-like neutron\nsource at the GC for 1 < E < 10 EeV was imposed, and searches for extended excesses were also\nperformed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nData Set\n\nThe widely accepted idea that the Galactic Centre harbors a super massive blackhole which would\nbe associated to the radio emissions from Sagittarius A*, together with the recent measurements\nby the H.E.S.S. collaboration of TeV \u03b3-ray emissions close to the location of Sagittarius A* [1],\nmakes the GC a very interesting place to look\nfor localized excesses of cosmic rays at EeV energies (1 EeV = 1018 eV), especially for Auger,\nwhere it passes only 6\u25e6 away from the observatory zenith. Also, there have been claims in the\npast from the AGASA [2] and SUGAR [3] experiments of large excesses in this region, none of them\nwere confirmed by a later analysis of Auger data\n[4]. Recently, several scenarios predicting neutron\nfluxes from the GC have been discussed in the literature [5], so that it is interesting to update previous Auger bounds with the larger accumulated\nstatistics of the surface array. The bulk of cosmic rays consists of charged particles, which are\nstrongly deflected in the galactic magnetic field.\nWe therefore perform as well an extended source\nsearch around the GC for windows sizes of 10\u25e6 and\n20\u25e6 . We divide our data set into 2 energy bands:\n0.1 < E < 1 EeV and 1 < E < 10 EeV. Both\nranges are studied in terms of Li-Ma overdensities\nsignificances.\n\nFor the present analysis, we use data collected by\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory from January 1st,\n2004 until March 31st, 2007, representing a considerable enhancement in the statistics compared to\nprevious Auger published results. We consider surface detector (SD) events where 3 or more tanks in\na compact configuration are triggered. The events\nare required to pass the level 5 trigger [6], for\nwhich the station with the highest signal has to\nbe surrounded by an hexagon of working tanks.\nSuch a requirement ensures a good reconstruction\nof the event. Finally, only showers with zenith angle \u03b8 < 60\u25e6 are used. The energy assignment for\neach shower is done by correlating a SD energy\nestimator (in this case, a variable related to the\ntime integrated water Cerenkov signal at 1000 m\nfrom the core) with the calorimetric energy measurement performed by the fluorescence detector.\nThis is the procedure used to build the Auger spectrum from SD data and it is discussed in details\nin [7]. The final data sample energy distribution\nis plotted in figure 1. For the events used in this\nanalysis, the angular resolution [8] is about 2.0\u25e6\nfor 0.1 < E < 1 EeV, where the sample is dominated by showers triggering only 3 stations and\n1.2\u25e6 for 1 < E < 10 EeV, with the enhancement\nof higher multiplicity events (see mean values of\nthe histograms in figure 2).\n\n\fA\n\nSEARCH FOR POSSIBLE ANISOTROPIES ...\n\nEntries\nMean\nRMS\n\n30000\n\n0.1 < E < 1 EeV\n\n40000\n\n517702\n17.78\n0.2886\n\nEntries\nMean\nRMS\n\n30000\n\n407400\n1.946\n0.8085\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n10000\n20000\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15000\n10000\n5000\n\n17.2\n\n17.4\n\n17.6\n\n17.8\n\n18\n\n18.2\n\n18.4\n\n18.6\n\n18.8\n\n19\n\nFigure 1: Energy distribution of the events after selection cuts showing the low energy SD threshold.\n\nSearches around the Galactic Centre\nTo impose upper limits on the flux of a hypothetical neutral particles source at the GC, we have done\nthe search using a Gaussian filter matching the experiment angular resolution, since this leads to an\noptimal search as shown in [9]. We have assumed\nthe following differential form for the CR spectrum\n\u0013\u22123.3\n\u0012\nE\nEeV\u22121 km\u22122 yr\u22121 sr\u22121,\n\u03a6CR (E) = \u03ba50\nEeV\nwhich has a slope consistent with the HiRes experiment in the energy range 1017.5 < E < 1018.5 eV\nand is a smooth extrapolation of the Auger spectrum measured above 3 EeV. The factor \u03ba is introduced to take into account the limited knowledge of the true CR flux and should be of order\nunity for the existing measurements at EeV energies (\u03ba = 1.2 if the HiRes normalization is the correct one, around 2 for AGASA and 1 for Auger).\nThe 95% CL upper bound in the integrated (and\nacceptance weighted) source flux is then given by\ndEAs \u03a695\ns (E)\n\nEmin\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n109045\n1.199\n0.6832\n\n5000\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nlog(E/eV)\n\nEZmax\n\n3.5\n\nEntries\nMean\nRMS\n\n10000\n\n0\n17\n\n3\n\n1 < E < 10 EeV\n\n15000\n\nEZmax\nn95\ns\n4\u03c0\u03c3 2 dEACR \u03a6CR (E),\n=\nnexp\nEmin\n\nwhere n95\ns is the signal counts upper bound at 95%\nCL for a given observed/expected ratio and nexp\nis the corresponding background counts inside the\nGaussian window of size \u03c3.

Therefore, to actually impose the limit, the acceptances As (E) and\nACR (E) for the source particles and for the CR\nbulk, as a function of energy, must be well understood, especially at low energies, where the SD detector is not fully efficient, as can be seen from the\nstrong suppression close to the SD threshold (see\nfigure 1).\n\n0.1 < E < 1 EeV\nBelow 1 EeV, neutrons from the GC are strongly\ndepleted by beta decays. An interesting prospect\nfor data below 1 EeV would then be the possibility of imposing upper limits on the flux of ultra high energy photons. The H.E.S.S collaboration has reported a remarkably flat spectrum of\ngamma-rays above 165 GeV from Sagittarius A*.\nA naive extrapolation of this spectrum would lead\nto a flux of photons of 0.58 km\u22122 yr\u22121 and 0.14\nkm\u22122 yr\u22121 above 1017 eV and 1017.5 eV, respectively. In table 1 we show the observed/expected\nratio for a point-like search using a Gaussian beam\nwith \u03c3 = 1.3\u25e6 and the corresponding 95% CL\nbound on the source counts. No significant excess\nis seen. As discussed above, the conversion of n95\ns\ninto a photon flux upper bound needs a dedicated\nstudy of the photon acceptance1.\n1. For the case of photons, not only we know the acceptance to the bulk (nucleons and heavier nuclei) is different from the source, but also the energy assignments.\n\n\f30 TH I NTERNATIONAL C OSMIC R AY C ONFERENCE\n\nsearch\nextended\npoint-like\n\nwindow size\n10\u25e6 (TH)\n20\u25e6 (TH)\n1.3\u25e6 (G)\n\nnobs /nexp\n5663/5657 = 1.00 \u00b1 0.02(stat) \u00b1 0.01(syst)\n22274/22440 = 0.99 \u00b1 0.01(stat) \u00b1 0.01(syst)\n192.1/191.2 = 1.00 \u00b1 0.07(stat) \u00b1 0.01(syst)\n\nn95\ns\n\n17.9\n\nTable 1: Summary of excess searches below 1 EeV around the GC (Sagittarius A*) in the form of extended\nsources using top-hat (TH) beams and point-like sources with Gaussian (G) beams.

The isotropy of\nthe sky around the GC for 0.1 < E < 1 EeV can\nalso be seen from figures 3 C) and D), which are,\nrespectively, a map of overdensity significances\nand the histogram of such significances, together\nwith the expectations of isotropy. Given the statistics at each bin, we expect that the Poisson distribution can be fairly approximated by a Gaussian,\nwhich is plotted in red.\n\n1 < E < 10 EeV\nGiven the neutron lifetime at rest (885.7s), a considerable fraction of neutrons produced in the 1 <\nE < 10 EeV energy range at the GC would survive and reach the Earth. Even though energies\nabove 3 EeV are probably too high to be reached\nby particles accelerated by galactic objects, in this\nenergy range, the bulk of CRs will be below that\nvalue. Unlikely the case of photons, if we assume\nhere that the composition of the bulk of the CRs in\nthe energy range studied is similar to the source,\nso that the source spectrum \u03a6s has the same spectral index as the CR spectrum \u03a6CR , we can obtain\ndirectly the 95% CL upper bound in the integrated\nflux (see numbers in table 2 where we also show\n\nthe results of extended source counting) as\n\u03a695\ns\n\nn95\n= s 4\u03c0\u03c3 2\nnexp\n\nEZmax\n\ndE\u03a6CR (E),\n\nEmin\n\nwhich can be finally converted into an upper limit\non the source luminosity of LGC < 1.25\u03ba \u00d7 1034\nerg/s. Such a limit already excludes most of the\nmodels for neutron production at the GC [5].\nIn figure 3 A) one shows the Li-Ma [10] significance distribution of overdensities in 5\u25e6 top-hat\nwindows in the region around the GC for the energy range 1 < E < 10 EeV. The distribution\nof the significances of figure 3 A) is shown in figure 3 B), together with the expectations from an\nisotropic sky. The overdensities are consistent with\nan isotropic sky.\n\nConclusions\nWith an exposure two times larger than the one\nused in the previous Auger published result, we\nhave found no significant CRs flux excess in the\nregion around the Galactic Center in 2 different energy ranges: 0.1 < E < 1 EeV and 1 < E < 10\nEeV. We have treated the GC both as an extended\nand a point-like source. The distribution of LiMa overdensity significances in this region shows\nconsistency with an isotropic sky for both energy\nranges.
