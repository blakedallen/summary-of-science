We also find several\nstars in the SMC for which the N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 and He II\u03bb4686 emission \"f\"\ncharacteristics do not appear to follow the same pattern as in Galactic stars.\nSince He II emission is due to the stellar wind (which will be weaker in SMC\nfor stars of the same luminosity), while N III emission is a complex NLTE effect\naffected mostly by temperature, it would not be surprising to find that these\nfeatures do not correlate with each other or with luminosity in SMC stars in\nthe same was as they do in Galactic stars, but theory does not provide a clean\nanswer, and analysis of more stars (both SMC and Galactic) are needed to resolve\nthis issue. The line-blanketed non-LTE atmosphere code FASTWIND was then\nused to determine the physical parameters of this sample of stars. We find\ngood agreement between the synthetic line profiles for the hydrogen, He I, and\nHe II lines in the majority of the stars we analyzed; the three exceptions show\nevidence of being incipiently resolved spectroscopic binaries or otherwise spectral\ncomposites.

Although\nwe did not use them to constrain the fits, good agreement is also found for the He I\n\u03bb3187 and He II \u03bb3203 lines in the near-UV, which we plan to exploit in future\nstudies. Our effective temperatures are compared to those recently obtained by\nRepolust, Puls & Herrero for a sample of Galactic stars using the same techniques.\nWe find that the Magellanic Cloud sample is 3,000-4,000\u25e6K hotter than their\nGalactic counterparts for the early through mid-O's. These higher temperatures\nare the consequence of a decreased importance of wind emission, wind blanketing,\nand metal-line blanketing at lower metallicities.\nSubject headings: stars: early-type, stars: atmospheres, stars: fundamental parameters, stars: mass loss\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTranslating the observed characteristics of O and early B stars into physical properties\nhas historically proven to be be very challenging. Because of their high effective temperatures, most of their flux is in the far UV, where even spacecraft cannot observe (due to\ninterstellar extinction), as the peak of the flux distribution F\u03bb will be below the Lyman limit\nfor stars hotter than about 32,000\u25e6 K. This means that the bolometric corrections are quite\nsignificant (\u22121 to \u22124 mags), with a steep dependence on the effective temperature. Thus\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ngetting the effective temperature right is the key to determining the other physical properties\nof a hot, massive star.\nSince we are always observing the fluxes of these stars far on the tail of the RayleighJeans distribution, the observed colors of these stars show little sensitivity to effective temperature. For instance, the Kurucz (1992) model atmospheres predict that a dwarf (log g = 4.0)\nwith Teff =50,000\u25e6K will have (U \u2212 B)o = \u22121.151 and a (B \u2212 V )o = \u22120.326, while a dwarf\nwith Teff =40,000\u25e6K will have a (U \u2212 B)o = \u22121.124 and (B \u2212 V )o = \u22120.311 (Massey 1998a).\nThe difference in these colors is well within the error of most photometry, and yet the bolometric correction (BC) is \u22124.5 mag for the former, and \u22123.8 mag for the latter, using the\nconversion of Vacca, Garmany, & Shull (1996). This uncertainty in the BC would result in\nan uncertainty of 0.15 dex in the log of the mass, using the mass-luminosity relation implied\nby the Schaller et al. (1992) Z = 0.02 evolutionary tracks (L \u223c M 2 ; see discussion in Massey\n1998a); i.e., 50M\u2299 vs. 70M\u2299 . Reddening complicates the interpretation of the photometry\nfurther, of course, and although reddening-free indices can be constructed assuming an average reddening law, even an \"optimal\" reddening-free index using space-craft accessible UV\nphotometry (such as F170W) remains too degenerate to be useful (Massey 1998a).\nIn principle, spectroscopy should allow us to resolve this degeneracy nicely, as the relative\nstrengths of He I and He II (O stars) and Si IV and Si III (early B supergiants) are quite\nsensitive to the effective temperature (and only secondarily to the log g), as confirmed by nonLTE calculations (Auer & Mihalas 1972; Kudritzki, Simon, & Hamann 1983; Lennon et al.\n1991). Indeed, a difference of one spectral subtype (O5 V to O6 V, say) roughly corresponds\nto a difference in effective temperature of 0.02 dex in log Teff , and a corresponding difference\nof only 0.13 mag in the bolometric correction, and hence 0.025 dex in the mass of the star\n(50M\u2299 vs. 53M\u2299 ) one would deduce from the mass-luminosity relationship.\nHowever, the absolute calibration of the relationship between effective temperature and\nline strengths (or, equivalently, spectral subtypes) requires reliable stellar atmosphere models. Unfortunately, the physics of these stellar atmospheres is quite complicated. The strong\nlines are all formed under non-LTE conditions, as first shown by Auer & Mihalas (1972), and\nin addition stellar winds provide a significant source of heating for the photosphere through\nthe backscattering of radiation (Hummer 1982, Abbott & Hummer 1985). Each decade has\nseen an improvement in our understanding of the physics of these stellar atmospheres, along\nwith the development the numerical techniques to include these effects in a model atmosphere. We identify four stages in the evolution of these models and hence in the effective\ntemperature scale of O-type stars:\n1. The introduction of non-LTE. The non-LTE models of Auer & Mihalas (1972) and\nKudritzki (1975, 1976) were relatively simple by today's standards, in being plane-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nparallel and including no metals, but in fact required the development of a number\nof innovative techniques in order to include the effects of non-LTE in line formation.\n(See the review by Kudritzki & Hummer 1990). The Auer & Mihalas (1972) models\nwere the first to correctly reproduce the observed line strengths of the helium and\nhydrogen spectral lines in O-type stars, as was shown by Conti & Alschuler (1971).\nThis led to the first modern effective temperature scale for O stars, that of Conti (1973).\nThis work was extended to the newly defined O3 spectral class (Walborn 1971b) by\nKudritzki (1980) and Simon et al. (1983).\n2. The introduction of mass-loss. Abbott & Hummer (1985) showed that the presence\nof stellar winds had a significant effect on the He I/He II line ratios and hence on\nthe effective temperatures deduced for O-stars. Although the photospheric lines are\nformed in a nearly static part of the atmosphere, the scattering of radiation by the\nstellar winds back into the photosphere results in substantial heating of the surface\nlayers, an effect known as \"wind blanketing\". This effect is quite significant, as a high\n(but realistic) mass-loss rate would result in a 42,000\u25e6K model matching an O3 V star,\nwhile the same model without mass loss would match that of an O5.5 V star. In other\nwords, the greater the mass-loss rate, the cooler the effective temperature is for a given\nspectral subtype. Conti (1988) revised the effective temperature scale to somewhat\nlower values, presumably to take this effect into account.\nOf special note is the revised effective temperature scale of Vacca et al. (1996), which\nhas generally become the standard against which other work is judged. This scale was\nbased on modeling drawn from the contemporaneous literature, and as such represented\nthe best that the field had to offer at the time. Although it included some work that was\nbased on wind-blanketed models, the vast majority of the data was not (e.g., Herrero\net al. 1992), and so the derived temperature scale was significantly higher than Conti\n(1988).\n3. The inclusion of hydrodynamics and metals. The next decade saw substantial improvements in the modeling, with the introduction of spherical extension and a more\nsophisticated treatment of the stellar wind as well as non-LTE treatment of the metal\nlines. Rather than just using the mass-loss rates, the hydrodynamics of the stellar\nwinds in both the sub- and supersonic regions was included. These improvements\nwere pioneered by the stellar atmospheres group in Munich (e.g., the unified model\natmospheres concept; see Gabler et al. 1989), which used them for the \"quantitative\nspectroscopy of hot stars\" (Kudritzki et al. 1989, Kudritzki & Hummer 1990, Kudritzki 1991). (A similar but independent approach was taken by Schaerer & Schmutz\n1994, who made the first attempt to include the opacity of metal lines.) Sellmaier et\nal. (1993) demonstrated that in addition to the effect of wind-blanketing, the stellar\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwinds produced emission that partially filled in the He I lines, which has a strong effect on the effective temperatures as a function of the He I/He II line ratios. Another\nseminal work from this period was Puls et al. (1996), who analyzed a large sample of\nGalactic and Magellanic Cloud O stars using UV and optical data. The UV spectra\nwere used to determine the terminal velocities of the stellar winds using the strong\nresonance doublets N V \u03bb\u03bb1239, 43, Si IV \u03bb\u03bb1394, 1403, and C IV \u03bb\u03bb1548, 51. The\nmass-loss rates were then determined primarily by observations at H\u03b1, combined with\nan assumption (and occasional adjustment) of \u03b2, a parameter that characterizes the\nsteepness of the velocity law in the stellar wind (Sec. 3.1). The classical MK optical/blue region (3800\u00c5 to 4900\u00c5) still provides the primary diagnostics of the surface\ngravity (from the hydrogen Balmer-line profiles) and effective temperatures (from the\nHe I and He II lines).\n4. The full inclusion of line blanketing. A significant improvement in hot star model atmospheres has been the inclusion of full line blanketing. The CMFGEN code, described\nby Hillier & Miller (1998) and Hillier et al. (2003) is one such example. Originally\ndeveloped and used for fitting emission-line features in the expanding atmospheres of\nWolf-Rayet stars, CMFGEN has been only recently used for the analysis of absorption lines in O-type stars (i.e., Martins, Schaerer & Hillier 2002, Crowther et al. 2002,\nHillier et al. 2003, Bouret et al. 2003). Although only a few stars have been fit, these\nstudies suggest that the effective temperature scale of Vacca et al. (1996) is too high1 .\n(See also discussion in Martins et al. 2002). Similarly, WM-basic, a code developed\nby Pauldrach, Hoffmann, & Lennon (2001), includes full line-blanketing, and its use\nby Bianchi & Garcia (2002) also suggests that a lowering of the effective temperature\nscale is in order. (WM-basic lacks the Stark broadening and the co-moving frame\ntreatment needed to compute useful synthetic spectra of the quasi-photospheric hydrogen and helium lines, but is very useful to fitting the metal lines found in the UV\nspectrum.) FASTWIND (\"Fast Analysis of STellar atmospheres with WINDS\"), first\ndescribed by Santolaya-Rey, Puls, & Herrero (1997), has now been modified to include\nan approximate-but highly realistic-treatment of line-blocking, with a similar effect on the effective temperatures (Herrero, Puls, & Najarro 2002, Repolust, Puls, &\nHerrero 2004).2\n1\n\nThis would be expected in any event given the lack of wind-blanketed model fits in the literature at the\ntime of the Vacca et al. (1996) study.\n2\n\nThe use of an approximate treatment of line-blanketing and blocking is necessitated by the need for\nreasonable computational times for a model. We note for comparison that a single run of CMFGEN, with its\nmore rigorous treatment, requires 9 hours on a 1.3-GHz Pentium IV processor, according to Smith, Norris,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nIn this series of papers, we will use new observational data with the latest generation of\nmodel atmosphere code to derive a new effective temperature scale for O and early B-type\nstars, exploring for the first time the effect that metallicity plays on the effective temperature scale (and other derived physical parameters) of these stars. This is crucial for many\nastrophysical applications, such as deriving the initial mass function from H-R diagrams\n(Massey 2003), or in modeling expanding shells, super-bubbles, and normal H II regions,\nwhere having an accurate census of the ionizing flux and amount of mechanical energy being\nsupplied to the region by stars is crucial (Oey & Kennicutt 1997). The series will eventually\nencompass hot stars in the SMC, LMC, Milky Way, and the Andromeda Galaxy, which span\na factor of 6.8 in metallicities, at least as measured by the oxygen abundances (see Massey\n2003 and references therein). Here we begin by studying a sample of hot stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Analysis of a second sample of Magellanic Cloud stars is currently underway,\nand will be published shortly.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nWe list in Table 1 the identifications and spectral types of the sample of stars we consider\nhere. As previously noted, our modeling requires observations taken in three spectral regions:\n(1) the 1200-1900\u00c5 region where the strong stellar wind resonance lines are found, in order\nto determine the terminal velocity of the wind; (2) the blue-optical region of the spectrum,\nwhere the strong Balmer hydrogen lines determine the effective gravity of the star, and\nthe He I and He II line strengths determine the effective temperature; and (3) the H\u03b1 line\nprofile, used to determine the mass-loss rate and the value for \u03b2, a measure of the steepness\nof the stellar wind velocity law (e.g., Puls et al. 1996). In principle, values for all three of\nthese are interdependent, but in practice, a reliable value for the terminal velocity can be\ndetermined by simple fitting with very approximate values for the other stellar parameters.\nDetermining of the effective temperature, surface gravity, and mass-loss rate does, however,\nrequire simultaneous treatment.\n& Crowther (2002). By contrast, a single run of FASTWIND requires less than 7 minutes on the slower\n750-Mhz SparcIII machine we used in this study. In general, something like 10 to 30 models are needed to fit\na star. Comparisons of the flux distribution of FASTWIND with those of WM-basic (Repolust et al. 2004)\nand CMFGEN (Herrero et al. 2002) have so far shown very good agreement.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n2.1.\n\nPhotometry\n\nOne of the necessary input parameters for the modeling is an accurate knowledge of the\nstar's absolute visual magnitude MV in order to constrain the stellar radius. Fortunately,\nwith stars in the Magellanic Clouds there is no uncertainty about the relative distances, and\neven the absolute distances are now known to reasonable accuracy (van den Bergh 2000).\nHowever, our experience is that photoelectric photometry of stars in the Magellanic Clouds\nis simply not as good as CCD photometry, as the large apertures used in the former often\nallowed contamination by nearby stars and/or nebular emission. Photometry with CCDs\nallows local sky subtraction, and the issues of crowding can be dealt with either by the\nuse of small digital apertures or, in extreme cases, point spread function fitting techniques.\nAccordingly, Massey (2002) obtained UBV photometry of nearly all of the stars in our target\nlist (outside of the R136 cluster) and, coincidentally, of an additional 264,600 stars. We list\nthe catalog number in Table 1; not all of the stars have cross-references in Massey (2002)\nTables 4 and 6. The color excesses at U \u2212 B and B \u2212 V were determined using the intrinsic\ncolors expected for each spectral type (Massey 1998b), and the results averaged, with the\nassumption that E(U \u2212B) = 0.72\u00d7E(B \u2212V ). For the R136 cluster, the WFPC2 photometry\nof Hunter et al. (1997) was used by Massey & Hunter (1998) to derive MV , and we adopt\nthese values here.\n\n2.2.\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nIn Table 2 we list all of the data directly used in our study. These were obtained from\nboth HST and the CTIO 4-m telescope, and cover the UV, H\u03b1, and optical/blue regions.\n\n2.2.1. Ultraviolet\nFor all of our program stars, we used HST to obtain spectra in the UV region, where the\nmajor stellar wind resonance lines N V\u03bb\u03bb1239, 43, Si IV \u03bb\u03bb1394, 1403, and C IV \u03bb\u03bb1548, 51\nare located. Our data came both from archival programs and our own program.\nFor the ultraviolet observations of the R136 stars we used the archival HST observations\nmade with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) by S. Heap (PI) under\nprograms GO-5297 (R136-20=R136a5) and GO-6018 (R136-24=R136a7, R136-36=R136a608, R136-40=R136a-535, R136-47=R136a-602, and R136-55=R136a-551. The data were\nobtained in 1994 and 1996, as shown in Table 2, and hence were post-COSTAR. These UV\ndata were the ones used by de Koter, Heap, & Hubeny (1997, 1998), and were obtained with\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe G140L grating centered at two wavelength settings, 1300\u00c5 and 1610\u00c5, and covered the\nspectral regions 1160-1450\u00c5 and 1460-1750\u00c5, respectively. The resolution of the GHRS data\nis 0.6\u00c5. The observations were made through the 'small science aperture\", which was 0.22\nby 0.22 arcsec in size.\nFor the ultraviolet observations of most of the SMC stars, we used the FOS observations\nmade by C. Robert (PI) under program GO-5444. These data were obtained in 1994 and\n1995, and were mentioned by Robert (1999) and included in Leitherer et al. (2001). The\ndata were obtained with the G130H grating covering 1140-1606\u00c5, with a resolution of 1.0\u00c5.\nThe data were taken with a 3.7 by 3.7 arcsec aperture.\nFor AV 296 in the SMC, and the three LMC stars outside of the R136 cluster (LH64-64,\nLH81:W28-5, and LH101:W3-24), we obtained our own UV observations using STIS/FUV\nunder program GO-8633.(Massey, PI). The G140L grating was centered at 1425\u00c5 for a\nwavelength coverage of 1150-1736\u00c5, with a resolution of 0.9\u00c5. The objects were observed\nthrough a 0.2 by 0.2 arcsec aperture. In addition, we obtained an observation with the\nsame setup for the SMC star AV 26 (previously observed by Robert 1999 with the FOS)\nwith STIS/FUV under program GO-9412 (Massey, PI). This was intended to serve as a\nself-consistency check for the terminal velocities obtained with the FOS and STIS.\n\n2.2.2. Optical\nFor all of the R136 stars we obtained optical data (both blue and H\u03b1) using HST.\nFor the rest of the stars, we obtained optical data primarily with the CTIO 4-m telescope.\nHowever, in a few cases, where we feared nebular contamination of the H\u03b1 profile, or in cases\nwhere the stars were very crowded, we supplemented the ground-based data with HST.\nFor the optical (blue and H\u03b1) observations of the R136 stars, we obtained spectra with\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using STIS/CCD. These data were obtained under GO7739 during 1998 Feb 3-5. These stars had all had previous optical FOS observations by\nde Koter et al. (1997, 1998) and/or Massey & Hunter (1998), but we knew from our own\nspectroscopy of R136 stars with the FOS (Massey & Hunter 1998) that the maximum SNR\nachievable with the FOS was quite limited (typically 50 per quarter-diode). In addition,\nwe expected that nebular contamination of the H\u03b1 profile was likely given the lack of sky\nsubtraction. This indeed proved to be the case, as we show in Sec. 2.3. STIS offered the\nadvantage of a higher SNR plus the ability to subtract nebular emission thanks to the long\nslit and two-dimensional format of the detector. Nevertheless, the FOS observations are\nstill useful in that they contain spectral lines that are not covered in our STIS observations,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nparticularly He II \u03bb4686, and we make use of the Massey & Hunter (1998) observations for\nthis line. Our blue R136 STIS observations were made with the G430M grating centered at\n4451\u00c5, and covering the wavelength range 4310\u00c5 to 4590\u00c5, chosen to include H\u03b3, He I\u03bb4387,\nHe I \u03bb4471, and He II \u03bb4542. The spectral resolution was 0.4\u00c5. We chose our exposure times\nto achieve a SNR of 100 per spectral resolution element. The H\u03b1 observations were obtained\nwith the G750M grating, centered at 6581\u00c5, and covering the wavelength range 6300\u00c5 to\n6850, with a spectral resolution of 0.84\u00c5. Our exposure times were chosen to achieve a SNR\nof 50 per spectral resolution element. The observations were made with the 0.2\u00d752 arcsec\nslit. The spatial sampling was 0.05 arcsec pixel\u22121 along the slit. The FOS observations\nof Massey & Hunter (1998) were made with a 0.26 arcsec diameter aperture, and covered\nthe 3250\u00c5 to 4820\u00c5 region with 3\u00c5 resolution. Those data were obtained under GO-6417\n(Massey, PI).\nThe optical observations for the other stars were mostly obtained during a 5 night\nrun on the CTIO 4-m Blanco telescope with the RC Spectrograph during 3-7 Jan 1999.\nGrating KPGL-D was used in 2nd order with a CuSO4 blocking filter for observations in\nthe blue (3750-4900\u00c5). The spectral resolution with the 200\u03bcm (1.25 arcsec) slit was 1.4\u00c5\n(3.8 pixels) on the Loral 3Kx1K 15\u03bcm CCD behind the blue air Schmidt camera. The slit\nlength was approximately 5 arcminutes, with a spatial sampling of 0.5 arcsec pixel\u22121 (i.e.,\nten times coarser than with STIS/CCD). For observations at H\u03b1 we switched to 1st order\nand observed from 5400 to 7800\u00c5 with a GG420 filter to block 2nd order blue. The spectral\nresolution for the H\u03b1 observations is 2.8\u00c5. In general, conditions were excellent during the\nrun. The stars were well exposed, and by considerable efforts at flat-fielding, we were able\nto preserve the high SNR of the data, typically 400 to 500 per spectral resolution element.\nThis was a particular challenge in the blue, where exposures of many hours of the dome flat\nbarely achieved a SNR of 100 at 4000\u00c5. Instead, we combined 27 30-sec projector flats to\nachieve a very high SNR flat suitable for removing the pixel-to-pixel variations, but whose\noverall illumination function did not match the sky. We corrected the projector flats by\nusing the average of 9 1200-second dome-flat (\"Punto Blanco\") exposures. Each set of flats\nwas combined with deviant pixel rejection. At H\u03b1 it was practical to simply use a series of\ndome flats to generate an adequate flat-field exposure.\nWe also have H\u03b1 HST STIS/CCD observations for two of the non-R136 stars. LH101:W324 is located in a region of strong nebulosity, and we were unable to obtain a successful\nobservation from the ground at H\u03b1, and so we observed it with a narrow (0.2 arcsec) slit\nwith HST using the G750M with the same setup as used for the R136 stars. For AV 26, the\nsame star for which we obtained both STIS and FOS UV observations as a consistency check\nfor the terminal velocities, we also used an observation at H\u03b1 as an additional check against\nour ground-based observation in a \"typical\" case. Both were observed as part of program\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nGO-9412 (Massey, PI). In order to fill up the remainder of the orbit for each of these two\nstars, we also observed them in the near-UV region of the spectrum, where the He I \u03bb3187\nand He II \u03bb3203 lines are located (see Morrison 1975). These data were obtained with the\nG430M grating centered at 3165\u00c5, covering 3020-3300\u00c5, with a resolution of 0.4\u00c5. All of\nthe STIS/CCD observations were done in at least two exposures (\"cr-split\"); in addition, all\nbut the near-UV observation of LH101:W3-24 were dithered along the slit at three positions\nin order to increase the SNR.\nThree of the program stars (AV 378, AV 396, and AV 451) had no observations at\nH\u03b1 due to on-going problems with the CTIO 4-m control system during the run. We have\nincluded these stars in the analysis despite this, making assumptions outlined in Sec. 3\n\n2.2.3. Reductions\nThe data reduction proceeded as follows. For the HST UV observations, all of which\nwere obtained through small apertures, we accepted the HST CALSTIS pipeline versions of\nthe reductions. For the HST optical (blue and H\u03b1) long-slit STIS/CCD observations, we\nre-reduced the data ab initio, using the recommended flat, dark, and bias frames. We have\nfound that by using the standard spectral reduction algorithms in IRAF3 (which include\noptimal extraction and profile-based pixel rejection) we can generally achieve a SNR that is\nsignificantly better than that produced by the pipeline. As others may also benefit from our\nexperience, we show the difference in Fig. 1. The SNR of the standard CALSTIS pipeline\nis worse than that of the re-reduced IRAF data for several incremental reasons. First, good\ndata are lost in the CALSTIS cosmic-ray rejection when the two halves of a \"cosmic-ray split\"\nimage are combined. The same operation using IRAF can readily be made less aggressive.\n(Admittedly one could achieve the same result by re-combining the images using the STSDAS\nimplementation of CALSTIS with similar adjustment of parameters.) Second, some of the\nSNR is lost because CALSTIS fails to do the spectral extraction (summing over the spatial\nprofile) using an optimal extraction routine. With optimal extraction (Horne 1988; Valdes\n1992), each point in the profile is summed using a weight that is inversely proportional to\nthe square of the sigma expected on the basis of the read-noise and signal level. Third, IRAF\nuses the shape of the profile to reject highly deviant pixels (Valdes 1992). As shown in the\nfigure, this is quite effective at reducing the effects of cosmic rays and hot pixels. For shorter\n3\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nexposures, and higher SNR spectra, we found less of a difference, but invariably the IRAF\nspectrum was to be preferred. The same IRAF extraction routines were used for reducing\nour CTIO 4-m data.\n\n2.3.\n\nA Comparison of Our H\u03b1 Spectra with Previous Studies\n\nEarlier, we expressed our concern that observations at H\u03b1 could give erroneous results\nin the absence of sky (nebular) subtraction, particularly in dense H II regions such as the\none in which the R136 cluster is situated. Contamination by nebular H\u03b1 would invariably\nlead to spuriously large mass-loss rates. The H\u03b1 data used in this study have all come from\nSTIS long-slit observations which allow good sky/nebular subtraction. Earlier studies by\nde Koter et al. (1997, 1998) of R136, though, were forced to rely upon observations made\nwith the FOS and a single aperture. Somewhat suggestively, these studies found that the\nmass-loss rates of the R136 stars were considerably higher at a given luminosity than that\nof other O stars that had been studied by Puls et al. (1996). This difference could be real,\nor it could be due to the different model atmospheres used to derive the mass loss rates-or\nit could potentially be due to the observations themselves. How well do the older FOS data\ncompare to ours?\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2. Our STIS (nebular-subtracted) spectra are shown in\ngreen, with the FOS (no sky subtraction) spectra used by de Koter et al. (1998) shown in\nred. In every case there is additional emission present in the latter. The fainter stars (R136040, R136-047, and R136-055) show the larger effect, as would be expected in the case of\nnebular contamination. For these stars, the FOS spectra fail to even detect the underlying\nabsorption feature, nicely revealed by our sky-subtracted STIS spectra. The de Koter et al.\n(1998) code did prove its flexibility in being able to match these (spurious) emission features\nin their stellar modeling. However, in these cases analysis of the FOS would of necessity lead\nto erroneously high mass-loss rates.\nHow much of an error would this extra emission introduce? We can provide an approximate answer by taking the parameters we derive for these stars in Sec. 3 and simply\nincreasing the mass-loss rates until we have emission that approximately mimics that of the\nFOS data. We find that mass-loss rates of 2-4 times what we derive from the STIS data\nwould be needed to approximate the FOS data. (In point of fact we could not get our H\u03b1\nprofiles to match those of the FOS data.) The mass-loss rates we eventually derive for the\nR136 stars are in fact not that different than those of de Koter et al. (1998) (and in some\ncases are actually higher!) but this is due to a combination of factors, primarily the much\nhigher temperatures we find from our greater SNR optical data.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nFinally, in Fig. 3 we compare our HST STIS H\u03b1 spectrum of AV 26 to that obtained\nwith the CTIO 4-m. The agreement is quite good, despite the 3.5 times worse resolution of\nthe ground-based data (see Table 2).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nTerminal Velocities\n\nThe first step in our analysis was fitting the UV lines to determine the stellar wind\nterminal velocities. Terminal velocities were measured from radiative transfer fits of the\nP-Cygni profile of the C IV \u03bb1550 doublet. Of the other important resonance lines present\nin our UV spectra, the shortwards profile of N V \u03bb1240 is often contaminated by strong\ninterstellar Ly \u03b1 absorption, making measurements of the terminal velocities from this line\nvery uncertain in most cases. Si IV \u03bb1400, on the other hand, was often weak, and thus would\nnot allow us precise constraints on v\u221e . We have followed the fitting technique described by\nHaser (1995) (see also Haser et al. 1995), based on the SEI method (cf. Lamers, CerrutiSola, & Perinotto 1987). This method has been used in more recent investigations of the\nUV spectra of Galactic and extragalactic O and B stars, including the HST/STIS work by\nHerrero et al. (2001), Urbaneja et al. (2002), and Bresolin et al. (2002), to which we refer\nthe reader for details. We allow for a radially increasing turbulent velocity law in the stellar\nwinds, which is described by the usual \u03b2 parameterization (\u03b2 \u2243 0.8 for O stars):\nv(x)\n=\nv\u221e\n\n\u0013\u03b2\n\u0012\nb\n1\u2212\nx\n\nwhere x = r/R is the radial coordinate normalized to the stellar radius R, and b fixes the\nvelocity of the inner boundary of the wind to V (R), a value that is of order of the sound\nspeed (Kudritzki & Puls 2000), i.e.,\nb=1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nV (R)\nv\u221e\n\n\u00131/\u03b2\n\n.\n\nThe best fit to the shortward line profile, which is mostly sensitive to the adopted terminal\nwind velocity, provided the results summarized in Table 3. In most cases the uncertainties\nin v\u221e are of the order of 50 to 100 km s\u22121 . Larger uncertainties (up to \u223c 200 km s\u22121 ) are\nestimated for those stars having weak C IV lines (noted by the colons appended to their v\u221e\nvalue in Table 3), and for which we have also relied on the Si IV lines for estimating v\u221e .\nTypically the maximum turbulent velocity is 9% of v\u221e , with values ranging from 3% to 14%.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nIn Table 3 we also compare our terminal velocities to those of Prinja & Crowther (1998)\nand de Koter et al. (1998) for the R136 stars in common. In considering this comparison, it\nis worth noting that the terminal velocities were measured from the identical data. In other\nwords, the differences between these measurements are purely due to technique. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time such a comparison has been carefully performed\nwith the same data. We see that the agreement is fairly good, a few hundred km s\u22121 ,\nconsistent with our estimate of our own uncertainty, but far greater than might be naively\ninferred by the precision with which these measurements are occasionally published. Perhaps\nfortuitously, our second measurement of the terminal velocity of AV 26 (which was observed\nboth with the FOS and STIS/FUV) agreed to the best of our measuring accuracy. This\ngives us confidence that the different instrumentation does not introduce much of a bias.\nWe show the CIV lines from the two observations in Fig. 4, along with our modeling of the\nterminal velocity, as an example.\n\n3.2.\n\nModel Fits\n\nThe stellar atmosphere code generates synthetic line profiles given the inputs of effective\ntemperature Teff , surface gravity g, the stellar radius R, the mass-loss rate \u1e40 , the stellar\nwind terminal velocity v\u221e , the He/H number ratio, and the metallicity Z/Z\u2299. For a given\nmodel, the parameters q(\u221e), q0 , and \u03b3 of the non-LTE Hopf function (Santolaya-Rey et\nal. 1997, Mihalas 1978) must be adjusted until flux conservation (< 2%) is achieved; in\npractice, this requires several runs. Good starting points for the Hopf parameters were\nfound by interpolating of successful values from previous runs of similar input values.\nIn fitting a star, we adopted the terminal velocities determined in the previous section,\nand assumed a metallicity Z/Z\u2299 of 0.2 for the SMC stars and 0.5 for the LMC stars4 A He/H\nnumber ratio of 0.10 was adopted, and adjusted if needed. For several stars the helium lines\nproduced by the models were too weak compared to the theoretical hydrogen lines, and we\nhad to increase the He/H ratio, as described below. If the He/H ratio was increased, the\nrelative mass fractions of the other elements were retained. Although this is not quite right\n4\n\nThe values for the metallicities are certainly arguable: as Westerlund (1997) notes, the relative abundances of the interstellar medium in the SMC, LMC, and the nearby regions of the Milky Way are non-solar.\nBased primarily on the work of Russell & Dopita (1990), Westerlund (1997) argues that the \"average\" metal\nabundance is 0.6 dex and 0.2 dex lower in the ISM of the SMC and LMC than in the solar neighborhood;\nsee also Garnett (1999). The gas in the solar neighborhood is perhaps 0.1 dex lower than that of the Sun\n(Shaver et al. 1973, Cameron 1982; Table 8 of Russell & Dopita 1990), although recent revisions in the solar\nabundances may suggest otherwise (Asplund 2003).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n(as some elements, such as nitrogen, would likely also increase in abundance, while carbon\nand oxygen would decrease) it does preserve the overall fraction of metals, particularly the\nunprocessed Fe group elements, which are most important in the blanketing. An examination\nof the evolution of the metallicity in the cores of massive stars suggests that this is a good\napproximation: although the relative proportion of elements changes during core H-burning,\nthe overall fraction of the mass of the star that is in metals changes very little until Heburning products are produced5 . A starting value for the mass-loss rate was estimated by\nadopting the bolometric correction based on the spectral type using the Vacca et al. (1996)\ncalibration and adding this to the absolute visual magnitude (Table 1) in order to get a\ncrude approximation of the bolometric luminosity L; a mass-loss rate based upon Puls et al.\n(1996) and scaled appropriately by the metallicity was then used for a first approximation.\nFollowing Repolust et al. (2004), we adopted a micro-turbulence velocity of 10 km s\u22121 for the\nmodels with effective temperatures of 36,000\u25e6K and below, and 0 km s\u22121 for hotter stars.\nA grid of 3-9 models using \"reasonable\" values for the effective temperature and surface\ngravity (based upon the spectral type and the Vacca et al. 1996 scale) was then run. The\ninitial starting value for the stellar radius was based upon the effective temperature and the\napproximate bolometric luminosity (using the relationship between the bolometric correction\nand Teff of Vacca et al. 1996). For each grid point the true radius was then computed using\nthe model flux and effective temperature. If the input and derived radius differed by more\nthan 1%, the input value was adjusted and the grid point recomputed.\nAfter the first series of models is run, a comparison is made by eye between the synthetic\nspectra from the models and the observed spectrum. For this, both a radial velocity and\nrotational speed v sin i must be adopted; these were determined prior to the modeling by\nexamining weak lines in the optical spectrum. In the modeling occasionally this initial\nmeasurement had to be slightly refined (by 10%) for a given star. In most cases we found\nv sin i \u223c110 or 120 km s\u22121 , comparable to the instrumental resolution of the ground-based\ndata, so these values should not be over-interpreted. In general, the wings of the Balmer\nhydrogen lines H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 are the primary diagnostics of whether the surface gravity is about\nright, while the relative strengths of the He I and He II lines provide the greatest sensitivity\nto effective temperature. The H\u03b1 profile provides the key diagnostic of the mass-loss rate.\nFor most of the stars, we achieved excellent agreement between the model synthetic\nspectra and the observed spectra. However, for three of the stars, no adequate fits could be\n5\n\nCompute the value Z = 1 \u2212 (Yc + Xc ) as a function of time in the models of Schaller et al. (1993), for\nexample. One will find for the 120M\u2299 (their Table 1) that metallicity in the core changes insignificantly\nfrom 0.0082 to 0.0077 during core H-burning. The same numbers are found for a star of 20M\u2299, as found in\ntheir Table 6.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nachieved. We believe this is only to be expected: the frequency of close binary O-type stars\nin the Milky Way is about 35% (Garmany, Conti, & Massey 1980); in most of these systems,\nthe mass ratio is near unity with the companion another O-type star. If the binary frequency\nis similar in the LMC and SMC (a subject for which there is little data to argue one way or\nthe other), then we would naively expect about one-third of our sample to consist of stars\nwith composite spectra. One or two additional stars are likely unrecognized composites.\nSubsequent to our beginning this study, one of the stars (R136-024) for which no good fit\ncould be found was shown to have light variations typical of eclipses (Massey, Penny, &\nVukovich 2002), further supporting this interpretation.\nRepolust et al. (2004) discuss a long-standing problem with stellar atmosphere codes\n(see Voels, Bohannan, & Abbott 1989) namely that He I \u03bb4471 (which is one of the principal\nspectral classification lines) synthetic spectrum is generally weaker than that observed in the\ncooler O-type giants and supergiants among their Galactic sample. This problem is not\nunderstood to date, although we are continuing to investigate various causes. Here we can\nsay that we find the same problem as reported by Repolust et al. (2004) for Galactic stars in\nour lower-metallicity Magellanic Cloud sample. Since the problem seems to only affect the\nlower-gravity stars cooler than O6, this is in practice not an issue, as for these stars we can\nrely upon other He I lines which are apparently not affected by this problem, most notably\nHe I \u03bb4387.\nRepolust et al. (2004) consider the possibility that the He I \u03bb4471 problem might be resolved by including a more consistent calculation of the temperature structure, including that\nof the outer part of the stellar wind. We originally used the identical version of FASTWIND\nas used by Repolust et al. (2004) for making the model fits. Near the end of our study,\nwork on an improved version was completed. This version now includes a self-consistent\ntemperature stratification, in which the equation of thermal balance of electrons is used to\nderive the temperature structure, except in the innermost region of the photosphere, where\na flux correction method is used (see Kubat, Puls, & Pauldrach 1999). In addition, the new\nversion includes a more extensive line list, leading to better fluxes in the UV. We re-ran\nthis improved version on all of our models, and carefully compared the results. Only the\nfits for the stars with very high mass-loss rates (R136-020 and R136-036) were significantly\naffected, as we expected. In those cases the new derived temperatures and mass-loss rates\nwere somewhat lower than those produced with the earlier version. No improvement was\nseen in the agreement for the He I \u03bb4471 line for the problem stars. The numbers and fits\ngiven here are all from this newer version; comparison with the Galactic sample analyzed by\nRepolust et al. (2004) should be valid, as the mass-loss rates are comfortably low, except for\nHD 93129A, which is a spectroscopic binary and excluded from consideration below.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nGiven that there is a certain amount of subjectivity in determining the \"best fit\", what\nare reasonable uncertainties on the fitted parameters? In general, we found that we could\ndetermine effective temperatures with an uncertainty of 1,000\u25e6 K, and log g to 0.1 dex. In\nthe cases where we had to increase the He/H ratio from 0.10 in order to get a good fit,\nwe generally were confident of our value to \u00b10.05, except for LH64-16, for which we find\na very high He/H ratio, with an uncertainty that is about 0.1. The uncertainty in \u1e40 is\ngenerally less than 20%, although we caution that our models lack stellar wind clumping,\nand we expect that this will affect the derived mass-loss rates for stars with H\u03b1 in emission,\nbut with minimal impact on the majority of our stars, for which H\u03b1 is in absorption (see\nRepolust et al. 2004). For stars with the lowest mass-loss rates (< 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) we\ninclude both the value used in the fit and the upper limit (under \"Comments\") in Table 4.\n\n3.3.\n\nSpectral Classification Issue at Low Metallicity.\n\nIn general, we followed the precepts of the Walborn & Fitzpatrick (1990) atlas in\n(re)classifying the stars. The basis for the spectral subtype is primarily the ratio of the\nHe I to He II ratios, particularly that of He I \u03bb4471 and He II \u03bb4542 (cf. Conti & Alschuler\n1971). For stars that would have been classically classified as \"O3\", we used the criteria\ngiven by Walborn et al. (2002a) to classify these stars as either O2 or O3 when we could. In\naddition to assigning a spectral subtype on the basis of the overall appearance of the spectrum (based upon comparision to the Walborn & Fitzpatrick 1990 atlas), we also measured\nthe equivalent widths of the He I \u03bb4471 and He II \u03bb4542 lines, and compared the ratio to\nthat used to define the spectral subtypes by Conti & Alschuler 1971). Below we quote the\nquantity log W \u2032 = log W (4471) \u2212 log W (4542), where W is the equivalent width. In practice,\nthere were no differences between the two methods.\nAssigning the luminosity class to these stars is slightly trickier. The amount of emission\nin N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 and He II \u03bb4686 results in an \"f\" designation, with the spectroscopic\ndescription \"((f))\" referring to weak N III emission and strong He II \u03bb4686 absorption. The\ndescription \"(f)\" refers to N III emission with partially filled in He II absorption, while\n\"f\" refers to both features being in emission. In the Milky Way the \"f\"s are invariably\nsupergiants (i.e., \"If\" stars), while the \"(f)\" are giants (i.e., \"III(f)\"), and the \"((f))\" are\ninvariably dwarfs (i.e., \"V((f))\"). But at low metallicity, such as found in the SMC, this\nshouldn't necessarily follow. The amount of emission in He II \u03bb4686 is a function of what\nis happening in the stellar wind (Klein & Castor 1978, Gabler et al. 1989). The physics\ninvolved in the formation of this line is not as simple as that which leads to, say, H\u03b1. The\nformation of H\u03b1 will be largely unaffected by blocking in the EUV, while HeII \u03bb4686 may be\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nstrongly affected, due to the importance of the HeII \u03bb303 resonance line in its formation. The\ndifference in metallicity between the Milky Way and the SMC will mean that two stars of\nthe same spectal subtype will have different effective temperatures, different wind densities,\nand will experience different amounts of EUV blocking. These competing effects make it\nhard to predict from first principles whether there will be more emission, or less emission for\nstars of the same spectral subtype in the SMC and Milky Way. Similarly, the emission in\nN III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 is a complex NLTE effect, and its size to large extent dependent upon the\neffective temperature (Mihalas & Hummer 1973; Taresch et al. 1997). Without any stellar\nwind, He II \u03bb4686 would be in absorption in stars of all luminosity classes, while N III would\nstill show emission. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that the \"f\" properties of a star\nmay not follow our Galactic prejudices as we look at O stars at lower metallicities. We will\ntherefore call attention to the MV when discussing the stellar classifications, as abhorrent as\nthis practice may seem to classification purists.\nOf course, one can always argue that any particular star with a discrepantly high visual\nluminosity may be a spectroscopic binary. At the distances of the Magellanic Clouds such\nblends might not even be revealed by radial velocity motion, given that 1\" projects to 0.24 pc\n(LMC) or 0.29 pc (SMC). However, below we find several examples (AV 14, AV 26, AV 75,\nand possibly AV 469) where the \"f\" characteristics are not totally consistent with the star's\nMV in the SMC, but none in the LMC. To explain these away as binaries would require our\nSMC sample to be biased towards unresolve multiple systems in a way that the LMC sample\nis not. While not impossible, the alternative explanation that we are seeing a metallicity\neffect on the \"f\" characteristics generally used to define the luminosity class, would appear\nto us as more attractive.\n\n3.4.\n\nComments on Individual Stars\n\nIn this section we discuss the derivation of the spectral types, and present the results\nof our model fits. The physical parameters are given in Table 4. We include in that table\nthe so-called \"spectroscopic mass\", M = g/g\u2299 \u00d7 R2 . In the figures showing the spectra,\noccasional bad columns have been removed by linear interpolation.\n\n3.4.1. SMC\nAV 14. AV 14 was first classified as \"O5 + neb\" by Ardeberg & Maurice (1977), and\nreclassified as \"O3-4 V + neb\" by Garmany, Conti, & Massey (1987). Its early spectral\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ntype resulted in its inclusion in our program. The \"+ neb\" designation often came about\ndue to photographic spectral classification of early-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds, as\nlocal sky subtraction was not possible as it is with CCD spectrometers. Here we reclassify\nthe star as O5 V. The visual appearance of the spectrum (Fig. 5a) is consistent with the\nmeasured ratio of the equivalent widths, log W \u2032 = \u22120.57. The absolute visual magnitude of\nthis star, MV = \u22125.8, would suggest it is intermediate between luminosity class \"V\" and\n'III\", according to Conti (1988); however, by comparison to any Galactic standards, the\nluminosity class is clearly \"V\", as He II \u03bb4686 is strongly in absorption. The spectrum is a\nvery good match to that of Walborn & Fitzpatrick's (1990) spectrum of HD 46150, although\nthere is no hint of N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission in our spectrum.\nWe obtained good fits after just a few models (Fig. 5b). In this case, the He I \u03bb4387\nline strength would suggest a slightly lower temperature (42000\u25e6K) than the one we adopt\nhere. However, this lower temperature produces He II lines which are weaker than observed.\nThe He I \u03bb4471 line shows good agreement with the fits based upon He II. The mass-loss\nrate is low, and therefore not very well determined, with adequate fits obtained with values\n\u1e40 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nAV 26. AV 26 was classified as an O7 III by Garmany et al. (1987). Here we classify it\nas just slightly earlier, O6, based upon the visual impression of the spectrum (Fig. 6a) We\nalso measure log W \u2032 = \u22120.22, consistent with the O6 spectral type. As for the luminosity\nclass, the star's absolute visual luminosity (MV = \u22127.0) requires it to be a bright supergiant.\nA Galactic O6 star of this luminosity, though, would have very strong N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 and\nHe II \u03bb4686 emission. Instead, we see weak N III emission and slightly weakened He II\n\u03bb4686 absorption. Nor would we expect to see N IV \u03bb4058 emission in an O6 star of any\nluminosity type. Are these peculiarities due to the low metallicity characteristic of the SMC,\nor are we seeing a composite spectrum? The presence of N IV emission in Galactic O-type\nstars is invariably either coupled to strong He II \u03bb4686 emission (in an O3-4 I), which we\ndon't see, or to N V absorption (in an O3 III), which we also don't see. (N IV \u03bb4058 in\ndwarfs is weaker than what we detect in our spectrum, -70m\u00c5.) Given this, we tentatively\nrule out the composite explanation6 . We believe the spectral features we see in AV 26 are\njust normal for an O6 I star in the low metallicity environment of the SMC. We classify this\nspectrum as O6 I(f). The following star (AV 75) provides an additional example. Unless the\nstar is a composite spectral type, then the behavior of the N III and N IV selective emission\nlines underscores the dangers of interpreting these line ratios as an effective temperature\n6\n\nWe are grateful to Nolan Walborn for correspondence on this subject, although our final conclusion\ndiffered from his, primarily because at our high SNR (350 per 1.2\u00c5 resolution element) we can place a very\nstringent upper limit on the presence of any N V absorption.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nindicator, as was recently done by Walborn et al. (2002a, 2004).\nWe judge the fits of the model to the observed spectrum good. These are shown in\nFig. 6(b). The surface gravity is log g = 3.5, consistent with the supergiant designation.\nAV 26 is one of the two stars for which we also have near-UV data for the He I \u03bb3187 and\nHe II \u03bb3203 lines. We will introduce these powerful diagnostic lines in Section 4.\nAV 75. AV 75 was classified as an O5 III(f) star by Garmany et al. (1987), and as\nO5 III(f+) by Walborn et al. (2000), who make reference to its \"entirely normal hot O giant\nspectrum\" in both the optical and UV. Our spectrum (Fig. 7a) agrees well with the \"O5\"\ndesignation, and we measure log W \u2032 = \u22120.38. However, at MV = \u22126.9 the star must be\nconsidered a supergiant but with He II \u03bb4686 in absorption rather than emission due to\nthe smaller stellar wind that comes from lower metallicity. The \"+\" designation signifies\nthat Si IV \u03bb4116 is in emission, a result which we also confirm. Like Walborn et al. (2000),\nwe note that the Si IV \u03bb4089 line is very weakly present in absorption, a result which we\nfind somewhat curious despite Walborn et al. (2000)'s explanation. We classify the star as\nO5.5 I(f+). Good agreement is found is found with the model fits (Fig. 7b).\nAV 207. Our spectrum (Fig. 8a) of AV 207 shows He I \u03bb4471 is just slightly stronger\nthan He II \u03bb4542 in this star, making it of spectral type O7.5. We measure log W \u2032 = +0.03.\nN III is very weakly in emission, with He II \u03bb4686 absorption strong, and so we designate\nthe star as \"((f))\". The absolute luminosity (MV = \u22125) is consistent with the star being\nof luminosity class \"V\" (i.e., Conti 1988). Previously the star was classified as O7 V by\nCrampton & Greasley (1982), in good agreement with our determination of O7.5 V((f)). A\ngood fit (Fig. 8b) was found for all of the lines. The mass-loss rate for this star is low, with\nvalues \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 yielding good fits.\nAV 296. At first glance (Fig. 9a), AV 296 appears to simply be a broader-lined version\nof AV 207. We classify it it similarly as O7.5 V((f)) visually, and measure log W \u2032 = +0.05,\nconsistent with that spectral subtype. The absolute visual magnitude is very similar (MV =\n\u22125.1) to that of AV 207. The star was previously classified as \"O5 V:\" by Garmany et al.\n(1987), with the \":\" denoting an uncertain type due to nebular contamination.\nWe obtained a barely adequate fit (Fig. 9b) to the spectrum. The required surface\ngravity log g is low, more characteristic of a supergiant than a giant or dwarf. Possibly this\nis an effect of the rapid rotation lowering the effective surface gravity, but we suspect that\nthis star may be a spectroscopic binary with not-quite-resolved double lines at the time of\nthe exposure. This view is further supported by the measured radial velocity of the star,\n\u223c 250 km s\u22121 , which is quite high given the 158 km s\u22121 systemic velocity of the SMC (see\nFig. 1 of Massey & Olsen 2003). A radial velocity program is probably warranted, but for\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nnow we include the derived values in Table 4 but note this uncertainty.\nAV 372. We originally classified this star as an O9.5 I (Fig. 10). Walborn et al. (2002b)\narrived at a similar type (\"O9 Iabw\"). The supergiant status is suggested not only since\nMV = \u22126.8 but also due to the strength of Si IV absorption. However, we were unable to find\nany simultaneous good agreement of the strengths of both He I and He II. In addition, the H\u03b1\nprofile appears to be P Cygni, and no amount of tweaking of the mass-loss rates and \u03b2 (from\n0.5 to 2.5) produced an acceptable fit at the temperatures indicated by the He I to He II\nratios. The Balmer line profiles were suggested of very low surface gravity (log g = 3.2), and\nat first we thought that we had encountered a problem with the models. However, further\ninspection of the optical spectrum revealed that the He I lines were significantly broader than\nthe He II lines. We measure a v sin i of 110 km s\u22121 for He II but require a v sin i of 200 km\ns\u22121 for He I. The centers of He I lines are also shifted by -20 km s\u22121 with respect to those of\nHe II. The star is likely a spectroscopic binary, with two stars contributing to He I and one\nstar dominating the He II spectrum.\nAV 377. The spectrum (Fig. 11a) appears to be that of an O5 V((f)), with slightly\nanomalously strong N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission. Even visually, however, we see that the He II\nlines are rather strong compared to hydrogen, in comparison to the Walborn & Fitzpatrick\n(1990) atlas. We measure a value of log W \u2032 = \u22120.55, consistent with the O5 spectral\nsubtype. The absolute magnitude, MV = \u22124.9, is consistent with the luminosity class \"V\"\ndesignation. Previously, the star was classified as O6 V by Garmany et al. (1987).\nFitting this star required increasing the He/H number ratio from the canonical value\n0.10 to a considerably higher value: 0.35. When we did this we obtained simultaneously good\nfits to the He I, He II, and Balmer lines (Fig. 11b). The only exception was He II \u03bb4542, for\nwhich the model line was weaker than the observed line. However, the fits at He II \u03bb4200\nand He II \u03bb4686 were good. Increasing the temperature slightly does not improve the fit\nto He II \u03bb4542 and makes the model He I spectra too weak. Similarly, either a slighter\nlower value (0.3) or higher value (0.4) for He/H produced He lines that were too weak or too\nstrong, respectively.\nIt has become increasingly recognized that rotation can play an important role in enriching the surface material even during the main-sequence stage (Maeder & Meynet 2000,\nWalborn et al. 2004). The enriched He abundance is likely consistent with the strongerthan-expected presence of N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission. The low mass-loss rate we find for this\nstar (\u1e40 \u223c 10\u22127M\u2299 yr\u22121 , with only an upper limit \u1e40 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 firmly established)\nis surprising given its spectral type, but is consistent with the UV spectrum, for which the\nstellar wind lines were quite weak.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nAV 378. We classify this star as spectral type O9.5 III (Fig. 12a) with guidance from\nthe referee Nolan Walborn, who argues that He II absorption is consistent with a giant classification. We initially preferred a supergiant designation. The spectral subtype is consistent\nwith log W \u2032 = +0.47. We find MV = \u22125.5, which is halfway between what we expect for\na giant and supergiant. The star has been previously classified as O8 V by Garmany et al.\n(1987).\nThe surface gravity of this star is low (log g = 3.25), which is much more consistent\nfor a supergiant than that of a giant. We quickly found that we needed to slightly increase\nthe He/H ratio to obtain an adequate fit for both the He I and He II lines (Fig. 12b). For\nthis star, the He I \u03bb4471 and He II \u03bb4387 lines were inconsistent, in the same sense as\ndescribed by Repolust et al. (2004), i.e., the model spectrum of He I \u03bb4471 is too weak at\nlower temperatures in giants and supergiants. Accordingly we have relied upon the He I\n\u03bb4387 and to a lesser extent on the He I \u03bb4922 line (not illustrated) in determining the fit.\nThis star did not have any measurable stellar wind lines, and so we simply adopted a\nvalue of v\u221e = 2000 km s\u22121 in computing its models. We lack data at H\u03b1, but began with\nthe initial assumption that the mass-loss rate was quite low (10\u22127M\u2299 yr\u22121 ). Examination of\nthe He II \u03bb4686 profile then suggests that \u1e40 may be even lower. The temperature, surface\ngravity, and He/H ratio are all very well determined in this regime.\nAV 396. We classify the spectrum of AV 396 as B0 III (Fig. 13a). The spectral type\nis clearly later than that of AV 378 (O9.5 III). Classically, the dividing line between O9.5\nand B0 was the presence or lack of He II in the spectrum (Jaschek & Jaschek 1990), but\nhigher signal-to-noise spectra now results in stars of B0 type having detectable He II \u03bb4200\nand He II \u03bb4542 as well as the strong (luminosity-dependent) He II \u03bb4686 line. If \u03c5 Ori\n(HD 36512) is considered a B0 V, as all authors have done since Johnson & Morgan (1953),\nthen we would conclude that the spectral type of AV 396 is also B0. A later type (such\nas B0.2, as introduced for \u03c4 Sco by Walborn 1971a), can be ruled out based upon the fact\nthat Si IV \u03bb4089 is strong but Si III \u03bb4552 is all but non-existent, while these lines are of\ncomparable strengths in \u03c4 Sco7 . Since we can determine the physical parameters of this star\nbased upon the He I to He II ratio, we consider the \"B0\" spectral type an honorary member\nof the O-type class. A comparison of the properties derived in this way will be made to what\nwe obtain using the Si IV to Si III lines in a subsequent paper. The absolute magnitude of\n7\n\nHere we forced to eschew the intermediate class O9.7 introduced by Walborn (1971a) and used by\nWalborn & Fitzpatrick (1990). First, this intermediate class is defined only for supergiants, and secondly,\nit is based upon the ratio of the He II \u03bb4542 to Si III \u03bb4552 lines. The strength of the latter is not only\ngravity-dependent, but the strength relative to He II will also depend heavily on the metal-content of the\nstar.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nthe star, MV = \u22125.2, is consistent with it being a giant, although (as expected) the Si IV\nlines are weaker with respect to He I what we would find in a Galactic giant. (Compare\nFig. 13a with the spectrum of HD 48434 shown in Fig. 17 of Walborn & Fitzpatrick 1990).\nPreviously the star was classified as O9 V by Garmany et al. (1987), doubtless due to the\n(weak) presence of He II.\nWe did not detect any measurable stellar wind lines in the UV, and we lack an H\u03b1\nspectrum of the star. We again assume a minimal mass-loss rate and a terminal velocity\nv\u221e = 2000 km s\u22121 in making the fit. We judge the fits shown in Fig. 13b excellent, with the\nvalues of Teff , log g, and He/H well determined. (We did have to increase He/H to 0.15 to\nobtain a good fit.) The model He I \u03bb4471 line is again weaker than expected compared to\nthe other He I lines, primarily He I \u03bb4387.\nAV 451. The spectrum of this star (Fig. 14) is clearly earlier than that of AV 396\n(Fig. 13), and very similar to that of AV 378 (Fig. 12a), except that the luminosity indicator\nSi IV to He I is much weaker in AV 451. We classify this spectrum as O9.5 III, consistent\nwith MV = \u22125.2 Previously this star was called an O9 V by Garmany et al. (1987).\nAgain, we were not able to discern any stellar wind lines in our UV spectrum of the\nstar, and we lack an observation of the H\u03b1 profile. We assume a minimal mass-loss rate\n(10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) and terminal velocity v\u221e = 2000 km s\u22121 in making the fit.\nOur first attempt at modeling the spectrum of this star, however, revealed that it is a\nlikely double-lined spectroscopic binary: the He I lines are much broader (v sin i = 200 km\ns\u22121 ) than the He II lines (v sin i = 120 km s\u22121 ), suggesting that this system consists of a\nmid-O and late-O pair of stars. No satisfactory combination of surface gravity and rotational\nvelocities could match the Balmer lines. We add this to our list of stars that deserve radial\nvelocity monitoring.\nAV 469. The spectrum of this star is readily classified as O8.5 I(f), with the only\nspectral peculiarity being that He II \u03bb4686 is in absorption, while in a Galactic O8 I star of\ncomparable MV we would expect it to be mostly filled in by emission (e.g., HD 17603; see\nConti & Alschuler 1971). Otherwise, the spectrum is very similar to that shown by Walborn\n& Fitzpatrick (1990) for HD 151804 (O8 Iaf), including the strong N III absorption features\nat 4097\u00c5 and 4511-15\u00c5(Fig. 15a). We measure a value of log W \u2032 = +0.24, which suggests\nthe intermediate (O8.5 rather than O8) type. The absolute visual magnitude of the star,\nMV = \u22126.2, is consistent with its supergiant designation. Previously, this star was classified\nas O8 II by Garmany et al. (1987), and as O8.5 II((f)) by Walborn et al. (2002b).\nDespite running 28 models for this star, we were left unsatisfied with the final fit\n(Fig. 15b). In particular, the H\u03b1 line has a small emission bump which we were unable\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nto reproduce despite our exploration of parameter space (both \u03b2 and \u1e40). In addition, the\nvelocity of the synthetic He II \u03bb4686 line is clearly shifted to the blue relative to the observed line. Nevertheless, values of Teff and log g seem well determined. He I \u03bb4471 was\nmuch weaker in the synthetic spectrum than in the observed spectrum, consistent with our\nexperience that this occurs at low surface gravities and relatively \"cool\" temperatures.\n\n3.4.2. The non-R136 LMC Stars\nLH64-16.8 . Massey, Waterhouse, & DeGioia-Eastwood (2000) classified LH64-16 as\n\"O3 III:(f*), where the \"*\" notation denotes that N IV\u03bb4058 emission is stronger than\nN III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission, which is generally a characteristic of O3 supergiants (Walborn &\nFitzpatrick 1990). We illustrate the spectrum in Fig. 16a. Although \"classically\" the O3\nspectral type is one which lacks He I absorption (Walborn 1971b, Conti 1988), high SNR\ndata can reveal weak (W =\u223c 75 to 250 m\u00c5) He I \u03bb4471 (Kudritzki 1980, Simon et al.\n1983). We do detect He I \u03bb4471 very weakly in our spectrum; the measured strength is\nabout 100m\u00c5.\nThe absolute visual magnitude of LH64-16 is only \u22125.2, which would suggest it is a\ndwarf. However, there is a general problem with this argument when applied to a degenerate\nspectral class. A 55,000\u25e6 K O star (were such an object to exist) and a 48,000\u25e6 K O star\nwould both be classified as \"O3\" (as they would lack significant He I). If they had the same\nbolometric luminosity, then the hotter star would be visually fainter. (Since stars evolve at\nfairly constant Mbol this situation could apply simply to the same star at two slightly different\nages; the fainter, hotter star would be the younger.) Thus if LH64-16 were a particularly\nhot O3 star, then it could well be of luminosity class III. From a morphological point of\nview, there are conflicting data on the luminosity criteria: the strength of N V \u03bb\u03bb4603, 19\nabsorption, and N IV \u03bb4058 emission would argue this is a supergiant, while the presence of\nHe II \u03bb4686 absorption would argue that it is a giant or a dwarf.\nWalborn et al. (2002a) used our spectrum of the star to help define a new spectral class:\nthat of O2. This was based on the relative strength of N IV \u03bb4058 and N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42\nemission and N V \u03bb4603, 19 absorption. The implications are, of course, that O2 is a \"hotter\"\nspectral type than O3, but the interpretation is complicated by the fact that the N lines\nare luminosity (gravity?) dependent. Walborn & Fitzpatrick (1990) nicely illustrate this in\n8\n\nNote that this star has sometimes been referred to as \"W16-8\", as it is also star 8 in Field 16 of Westerlund\n(1961). The LH64-16 designation is from Lucke (1972). A hybrid version of the name, \"LH64W8\", was\nunwisely used as the designation for the HST observations.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ntheir Fig. 8. There is not a good theoretical underpinning of this new spectral type, as yet.\nWalborn et al. (2002a) consider LH64-16 to be of an O2 III(f*) star.\nThe situation has been further complicated by the discovery that LH64-16 is nitrogenenriched. Walborn et al. (2004) produce yet another new spectral designation, namely\nON2 III(f*) to describe the spectrum. Their modeling of our spectrum suggests a somewhat enhanced He/H number ratio (0.25) and extremely high temperature (55,000\u25e6K), where\nmodel fits were obtained by CMFGEN using the near-UV and optical spectrum. (Values of\nsurface gravity were adopted, so the issue of luminosity class remains unresolved.) The very\nhigh temperature is unprecedented for a model fit with fully-blanketed models.\nOur own modeling of this star is shown in Fig. 16b, where we have fit only the optical\nlines. We found that we needed a high He/H ratio if we were to get the model He II lines as\nstrong as what is observed, and we were forced to increase the He/H ratio to 1.0 to obtain\na satisfactory fit. Once we had increased the He/H ratio, though, we needed a very high\neffective temperature in order to make the He I lines as weak as that observed. Our value for\nthe surface gravity is well constrained (as usual) by the wings of the Balmer line profiles to\nlog g = 3.9, suggesting that it may be a dwarf. The He II \u03bb 4686 profile is very sensitive to\nthe mass-loss rate, and the value we derive from H\u03b1 gives a reasonably good fit. Given that\nWalborn et al. (2004) were also able to model the atmospheric abundances, including the\nvariations of CNO with CMFGEN, their parameters may be better determined than ours,\nalthough the source of the disagreement in the He/H ratio (our 1.0 vs. their 0.25) is hard to\nunderstand, especially given the fact that they were forced to a similarly high temperature\nin order to fit the star. They present this star as a possible example of \"homogeneous\nevolution\"-that somehow, possibly due to rapid rotation, the star has evolved chemically\nin such a way that the surface composition is similar to that of the core. The nitrogen\nenhancement found by Walborn et al. (2004) is a factor of 7 over the presumed starting\nvalue. This much nitrogen is consistent with any He/H ratio from 0.25 to 2.0, as it is simply\nthe CNO-burning equilibrium ratio (see Massey 2003 and references therein.)\nOur modeling generally supports their results, although not necessarily their interpretation. We find a \"spectroscopic mass\" (M \u223c g/g\u2299 \u00d7 R2 ) of 26M\u2299 . A similar value is\nnecessitated by the model of Walborn et al. (2004). Yet, the \"evolutionary mass\" found by\nWalborn et al. (2002a) is much higher, 72M\u2299 , based upon the (non-rotation) evolutionary\nmodels of Schaerer et al. (1993). Although for some time there were hints of a mass discrepancy between the spectroscopic and evolutionary masses, improvements in the models (both\natmospheric and evolutionary) have largely eliminated this problem (Repolust et al. 2004\nand references therein). We will revisit this topic in the second paper in this series. However, here we offer the suggestion that the relatively low mass inferred by the atmosphere\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nmodeling (both ours and that of Walborn et al. 2004) is connected to the high chemical\nabundances found at the surface. Possibly this star is the result of binary evolution, or some\nother peculiarity. We are indebted to Nolan Walborn for calling this discrepancy to our\nattention.\nLH81:W28-5. The spectrum of LH81:W28-5 (Fig. 17a) is readily classified as O4 V((f+)),\nwith log W \u2032 = \u22120.68. The presence of weak N V 4603,19 absorption is consistent with this\nclassification. The \"+\" designation denotes the presence of Si IV \u03bb\u03bb4089, 4116 emission.\nSi IV emission is not seen in the example of an O4 V((f)) star shown by Walborn & Fitzpatrick (1990), but our data are of higher SNR, and indeed the Si IV emission features are\nseen in the Galactic star HDE 303308 described as O4 V((f+)) by Walborn et al. (2002a).\nThe faint absolute visual magnitude (MV = \u22125.0) is consistent with the strong He II \u03bb4686\nabsorption feature in determining the \"V\" luminosity class. Walborn et al. (2002a) cites this\nstar as a representative of the O4V((f+)) class.\nOur fit of the parameters of this star was straight-forward, other than the fact the He/H\nratio had to be increased slightly in order to produce He II lines as strong as those observed.\nWe judged the agreement between the models and the observations very good, and show the\ncomparison in Fig. 17b.\nLH101:W3-249 . Our ground-based spectrum of LH101:W3-24 (Fig. 18a) is strongly\ncontaminated with nebular emission lines at the Balmer lines, despite our best efforts to\navoid them by narrowing the slit and attempting various regions for sky subtraction. We\nwere fortunate to be able to supplement our ground-based data with exposures both in the\nnear-UV and at H\u03b1 with HST, allowing us to use a very narrow (0.2 arcsec) slit. (We will\ndiscuss the near-UV spectrum below in Sec. 4.) Previously, the spectrum had been classified\nas O4 V by Testor & Niemela (1998), presumably because He I \u03bb4471 is very weakly present.\nWe measure an equivalent width of 120m\u00c5 for this line, placing it in the same regime as\nother O3 stars. We thus retain the O3 V((f)) designation of Massey et al. (2000).\nFortunately, the strong nebular lines did not interfere with the fitting: our uncontaminated HST H\u03b1 spectrum was used to determine the mass-loss rate, while the ground-based\nBalmer line observations served adequately for the determination of log g, which after all is\nbased upon the fits to the Balmer wings.\nWe obtained adequate fits, although we did have to slightly increase the He/H ratio from\n0.10 to 0.15 to make the He II lines sufficiently strong. There was some disagreement between\n9\n\nThis star was also cataloged as ST5-27 by Testor & Niemela (1998). It was observed with HST under\nthe nomme de plume \"LH101W24\".\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nHe II \u03bb4200 and He II \u03bb4542, and we arrived at a compromise. The spectra are somewhat\nmore noisy than most due to the need for a narrow extraction aperture to reduce the effects\nof the nebular emission. In addition the He II \u03bb4200 line is compromised somewhat due to\na bad column which sat on the red wing of the profile. Nevertheless, the overall agreement\n(Fig. 18b) is good.\n\n3.4.3. The R136 Stars\nThe spectroscopic study of R136 by Massey & Hunter (1998) identified more O3 stars\nthan had been previously known in total elsewhere. The FOS spectra that were used for\nthat study were of relatively poor SNR, and suffered from intermittent behavior of some\nof the diodes, limiting the ability to flat-field well. As described in Sect. 2.2, we obtained\nhigher quality data with STIS in a follow-up study designed to allow the modeling we now\ndescribe. However, the STIS data covered only a very limited wavelength range (from H\u03b3\nthrough He II \u03bb4542). In what follows we make use of the older FOS data in describing\nthe overall spectrum (and determining the spectral type), but restrict our modeling only\nto the STIS data. The fits to the FOS's He II \u03bb4686 observations are shown, however, for\ncomparison. In presenting the blue-optical spectra, we have spliced in the better STIS data\nin the wavelength region 4310\u00c5 to 4590\u00c5.\nR136-020. This star was classified as O3 If*/WN6-A, with the \"slash\" designation a\ntribute to the very strong emission features at N IV \u03bb4058 and He II \u03bb4686, with strengths\nand widths comparable to those produced in the stellar wind of a Wolf-Rayet star. A comparison of Fig. 19a with that of the O3 If* star HD 93129A shown in Walborn & Fitzpatrick\n(1990) shows that this is simply a more extreme example, and classically one could drop the\n\"slash\" part of the designation and simply call the star an O3 If*. The star was left off the\nlist of O3 stars by Walborn et al. (2002a) due to its \"slash\" description. However, by their\nclassification criteria it would be called an O2 If*, given the strength of N IV \u03bb4058 emission\nand the lack of any He I absorption or N III emission. The absolute magnitude MV = \u22126 is\nconsistent with the star's supergiant designation.\nDespite the high mass-loss rate implied by both H\u03b1 and He II \u03bb4686, the fitting of this\nstar was straight-forward, and good matches were achieved. A slightly elevated He/H ratio\nwas needed in order to make the He II \u03bb4542 line as strong as observed. He I \u03bb4471 is not\ndetected even in our high SNR spectrum, and thus the effective temperature (and hence\nbolometric luminosity) given in Table 4 must be considered a lower limit.\nR136-024. This star was classified as O3 III(f*) by Massey & Hunter (1998); its spectrum\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nis shown in Fig. 20. We were unable to obtain a good fit, and the broadness of the spectral\nlines suggests it is an incipiently resolved double-lined binary. Indeed, after we began this\nproject, Massey et al. (2002) found light variations that were typical of eclipses. Given the\nweakness of He I in the spectrum, this system likely consists of two O3 V's, and thus is a\ngood candidate for radial velocity studies with HST. Such a project is being proposed.\nR136-036. This star was classified as O3 If* by Massey & Hunter (1998); its spectrum\nis shown in Fig. 21a. The spectrum shows the same luminosity features of the O3 If* star\nR136-020, i.e., strong NIV \u03bb4058 and He II \u03bb4686 emission, and N V \u03bb4603, 19 absorption.\nWalborn et al. (2002a) refer to this as an \"O2-O3 If*\" star under the designation \"MH36\".\nThe ambiguity in the spectral type was due to the noisy region around He I \u03bb4471 in the FOS\nspectrum; with our higher SNR STIS spectrum, they would undoubtedly have considered this\nan O2 If* star given the lack of He I and the fact that the N IV emission is so much stronger\nthan any possible N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission. We adopt this designation here, despite our\nambivalence about the use of selective emission features to extend the spectral classification.\nOur fits of H\u03b3 and He II \u03bb4542 are quite good; the effective temperature given in Table 4\nis the lowest for which we obtain a sufficiently weak He I \u03bb4471 line, and thus must again\nbe considered a lower limit. Although we investigated a broad area of parameter space (\u03b2\nand \u1e40 ) we did not obtain good fits to the stellar-wind sensitive lines H\u03b1 and He II \u03bb4686.\nPossibly this is a consequence of the lack of wind clumping in our models, as H\u03b1 is strongly\nin emission.\nR136-040. This star was classified as O3 V by Massey & Hunter (1998); its spectrum\nis shown in Fig. 22a. Since neither NIV \u03bb4058 nor N III \u03bb\u03bb4634, 42 emission is visible, we\nwould be hard-pressed to refine the classification (O2-O3.5) using the scheme of Walborn et\nal. (2002a). There is no He I \u03bb 4471 detected in this spectrum.\nIn order to produce He II \u03bb4542 as strong as what is observed, we must increase the\nHe/H ratio to 0.2. That then requires a very high Teff to match the stringent limit on the\nHe I\u03bb4471 line. Again this effective temperature should be treated as a lower limit, since\nno He I\u03bb 4471 is actually detected, despite the excellent SNR (150 per 2-pixel resolution\nelement) and resolution of our data.\nR136-047. This star was classified as O3 III(f*) by Massey & Hunter (1998); its spectrum\nis shown in Fig. 23a. Despite the higher SNR data at He I \u03bb 4471, no trace of this line could\nbe found. The giant luminosity class is due to the presence of N IV \u03bb4058 emission. By the\ncriteria of Walborn et al. (2002a), this would have to be called an O2 III(f*) star. We obtained\ngood matches of the model spectrum to the observed spectrum for this star (Fig. 23b), but\nthe fit required a very high effective temperature (Teff =51,000\u25e6K) in order to make the model\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nHe I \u03bb4471 line sufficiently weak. Even so, we must consider this a lower limit, since no He I\n\u03bb4471 is detected in our spectrum. Although we explored much of parameter space (30\nmodels), we never found a combination of \u03b2 and \u1e40 that produced as good a fit to the H\u03b1\nprofile as we would have liked.\nR136-055. This star was classified as O3 V by Massey & Hunter (1998); its spectrum is\nshown in Fig. 24a. Weak He I \u03bb4471 is present, allowing an accurate effective temperature\nto be determined. We were able to fit the spectrum of this star very straight-forwardly\n(Fig. 24b), deriving a high effective temperature and a surface gravity consistent with its\nbeing a dwarf.\n\n4.\n\nIntroducing the He I \u03bb3187 and He II \u03bb3203 Diagnostic Lines\n\nMorrison (1975) described coud\u00e9 observations of the He I \u03bb3187 and He II \u03bb3203 lines\nin O and early B-type stars made from the high altitude of Mauna Kea. She motivated this\ndiscussion by noting that the He II \u03bb3203 absorption line (n = 3 to 5) provided a unique\nopportunity to test stellar atmosphere models, as it was the only accessible He II line that\ndid not involve n = 4 (i.e., all of the Pickering lines arise from n = 4; e.g., He II \u03bb4200, n = 4\nto 11; \u03bb4542, n = 4 to 9). Given the presence of emission at He II \u03bb4686 (n = 4 to 3) in\nmany O-type supergiants, Morrison (1975) argued that the n = 4 level is overpopulated, at\nleast in some parts of the stellar atmosphere for some stars, although today we would instead\nsay that the emission is simply a pure wind effect, due to the large contributing volume, and\nhas nothing to do with overpopulation. Morrison (1975) found that the He II \u03bb3203 line\nwas much weaker than predicted by the plane-parallel non-LTE models of Auer & Mihalas\n(1972) for the stars in which He II \u03bb4686 is in emission, although reasonable agreement was\nfound in the other cases. The He I \u03bb3187 line falls in the same spectral region but there\nwere no theoretical predictions for the strength of this line at the time.\nWe are unaware of any follow-up of this interesting work, doubtless due to the difficulty\nof observing this wavelength region from the ground. Despite the numerous observations\nof OB stars with IUE (in operation from 1978 to 1996), no new studies of this line were\nmade, probably due to the proximity of the He II \u03bb3203 line to the long-wavelength cut-off.\nHowever, this wavelength region is easily observed with HST. We have long been intrigued\nby the Morrison (1975) paper, and when it became apparent that there was enough time\nremaining in the visibility period for a few of our stars to allow observations in this region\nafter our primary observations were complete, we availed ourselves of this opportunity (see\nSec. 2.2.2). We did not use these lines to determine the model fits previously described;\ninstead, we simply use the near-UV observations here to set the stage for future work, by\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\ncomparing with our model fits.\nWe have data in the near-UV for two of the stars in this paper, AV 26 and LH101:W3-24.\nThe first of these is an O6 I(f) supergiant, and the latter an O3 V((f)) dwarf. Neither has\nHe II \u03bb4686 in emission, however. The spectrum of AV 26 has a good SNR (100 per 2-pixel\nspectral resolution element), while the spectrum of LH101:W3-24 is much noisier (SNR=11\nper 2-pixel spectral resolution element).\nWe show the spectra and the model predictions in Fig. 25. First, we note that neither\nstar has measurable He I \u03bb3187 in its spectrum. The adopted model for AV 26 predicts a\nslightly stronger He I \u03bb3187 than observed, while the agreement for LH101:W3-24 is as good\nas the signal-to-noise allows. Second, the He II \u03bb3203 line is very well matched for AV 26.\nThe synthetic He II \u03bb3203 spectrum may not be strong enough in LH101:W3-24; it is hard\nto tell, given the poor SNR. Further comparisons are planned in the next paper in this series.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions and Summary\n\nWe have attempted to model the spectra of 20 O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds,\nsucceeding in obtaining adequate or good fits in 17 cases. We suspect that the other three\nstars are binaries, and expect that a few more in our sample are in reality composite spectra,\ngiven the statistical expectations that a third of (Galactic) O-type stars are spectroscopic\nbinaries. The physical parameters of the stars which were successfully modeled are well\ndetermined, and should permit us to refine the effective temperature scale.\nIn describing the spectral features in our sample, we were struck by the fact that many\nof our SMC stars appear to be more luminous than their \"f\" characteristics (N III \u03bb4634, 42\nand He II \u03bb4686) would indicate. Although one cannot rule out a binary explanation, we\ndid not see such discrepancies amoung our LMC sample, suggesting that the effects of lower\nmetallicity may be responsible. N III emission is a complex NLTE effect dependent primarily\non temperature, while He II \u03bb4686 is formed in the stellar wind, and its formation will be\naffected by the temperature, wind density, and amount of EUV flux, all of which will be\naffected by the metallicity. Thus one would not expect a priori that these \"f\" characteristics\nwould exhibit the same behavior at low metallicity as they do in Galactic objects. We\nhave identified here everal examples where the He II emission is weaker than one might\nexpect given the star's MV , while the referee Nolan Walborn has kindly reminded us of\ntwo additional examples in the SMC, Sk 80 and AV 83, where the He II \u03bb4686 emission is\npossibly stronger than in many Galactic counterparts. More modeling of both Galactic and\nSMC stars are needed to understand this issue.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nIn the second paper of this series we will roughly double the sample of Magellanic\nCloud stars that have been analyzed in this manner. However, it is tempting to compare\nthe effective temperatures we have derived here with those recently found for Galactic stars\nby Repolust et al. (2004). We show this comparison in Fig. 26, where we have separated\nthe effective temperatures by luminosity class. For comparison, we also show the effective\ntemperature scales determined by Conti (1988) (dashed line) and Vacca et al. (1996).\nThe data for the giants are too sparse as yet to draw any conclusions. However, for both\nthe dwarfs and the supergiants we see that the Magellanic Cloud stars have significantly\nhigher temperatures than their Galactic counterparts in the range from the earliest types\nthrough mid-O. By the late O-types, there is less of a difference. The data are also too\nsparse yet to draw firm conclusions about differences in the effective temperature scales for\nO stars for the SMC vs. LMC. In the sample we have analyzed so-far we have mainly very\nearly O-type stars in the LMC, and somewhat later types in the SMC. We will be able to\naddress this more fully in the second paper in this series, where we complete our Magellanic\nCloud sample.\nNevertheless, this result is quite intriguing. As described in Sec. 1, we would expect\nthe lower mass-loss rates (due to the lower metallicities) in the Clouds to result in a higher\neffective temperature in comparison to a star of the same spectral subtype in the Milky Way:\nfirst, there will be less wind emission affecting the He I. In addition, the smaller metallicity\nwill lead to reduced wind-blanketing and line-blanketing. Together, these combine to result in\neffective temperatures which are \u223c 3000 \u2212 4000\u25e6K (10%) greater at O5 V for the Magellanic\nCloud stars in our sample.\nWe note with some irony that despite the substantial improvements in the stellar models\nover the years, the older effective temperature scales of Conti (1973) and Conti (1988), based\nprimarily on the original non-LTE models of Auer & Mihalas (1972), have held up remarkably\nwell for the Galactic stars. Work over the next few years will result in an improved scale\nthat will take metallicity into account, but for now the Conti (1988) scale is to be preferred\nover more recent editions (e.g., Vacca et al. 1996).\nThree recent studies have analyzed a limited sample of Magellanic Cloud O stars using\nCMFGEN. Crowther et al. (2002) studied four extreme O supergiants (luminosity class\n\"Iaf+\") in the Clouds, and derived temperatures that are considerably lower than those\nshown in Fig. 26a for our sample. Hillier et al. (2003) analyzed the SMC stars extreme\nsupergiant Az 83 (O7 Iaf+) and Az 69 (OC7.5 III((f))). The supergiant is also cooler than\nwhat we find, but this may be due to the fact that the more extreme supergiants have lower\neffective temperatures. The giant star agrees well with the Galactic giants. Bouret et al.\n(2003) have examined the spectra of five O dwarfs and one O-type giant in the NGC 346\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\ncluster in the SMC. Here the results are more mixed. The temperature of the star they\nclassify as an O2 III is in accord with what we find (Fig. 25b), as are some of the results for\nthe dwarfs. Others of their dwarfs have effective temperatures lower than what Repolust et\nal. (2004) found for Galactic stars of the same spectral type. Are the differences due to the\ndifferent models being employed? We withhold any judgement until a similar sized sample\nof stars have been analyzed with both codes.\nIn the second paper in this series we will complete our Magellanic Cloud sample. At\nthat time, we will also examine the effect that the new data have on the wind-momentum\nluminosity relation, and give a comparison between the masses derived from the present\natmosphere fits and those of stellar evolutionary models.\nThis paper draws heavily upon the HST archive, and it thus seems appropriate acknowledge the ease and convenience of a valuable resource often taken for granted in our\ncommunity. We are also very grateful to our program coordinator Beth Perriello, without\nwhose efforts our new HST data could not have been obtained. Support for programs GO6416, GO-7739, GO-8633, and GO-9412 was provided by NASA through grants from the\nSpace Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. Useful comments on an\nearlier draft of this paper were kindly given by Peter Conti, Artemio Herrero, Deidre Hunter,\nNancy Morrison, Daniel Schaerer, and Bill Vacca. Nolan Walborn waived anonymity as the\nreferee and made a large number of suggestions, for which we are grateful. We also acknowledge the excellent support received during our observing run at Cerro Tololo in January\n1999, and in particular the efforts of our telescope operator Patricio Ugarte.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbbott, D.

The data consist of a \"CR-SPLIT\" 300 sec exposure (i.e., two 150 sec segments) and are\narchived by STScI as data set \"o6km14010). The complete H\u03b1 data set for this star consists\nof three such exposures. The SNR in the CALSTIS reduction is 18 in a spike-free region;\nthe same region in the IRAF-reduced spectrum has a SNR of 22. The many spikes (due to\ncosmic rays and hot pixels) in the CALSTIS spectrum further degrade the SNR.\n\nFig. 2.- A comparison of our spectra (green) with the FOS spectra (red) used by de Koter\net al. (1998) for the six R136 stars. In all cases there is additional emission present in the\nFOS data, due to nebular contamination.\nFig. 3.- A comparison of our HST/STIS spectrum (green) with the ground-based CTIO\nspectra (red) of AV 26.\nFig. 4.- The two observations of the C IV \u03bb1550 profile are shown by the solid (Cycle 12)\nand dashed (Cycle 9) black lines. Our fit is shown by the blue curve. The fact that the\nfit does not reproduce the absorption features on the longwards part of the profile and the\nemission peak is due to there being no correction made for photospheric absorption. This\ndoes not affect the determination of the terminal velocity.\nFig. 5.- AV 14. (a) A portion of the blue-optical spectrum of AV 14 is shown with the\nmajor lines identified. (b) Selected spectral lines (black) are shown compared to the model\nfits (red). The bar to the left of each line shows a change of 20% intensity relative to the\ncontinuum, and the top of the bar denotes the continuum level. A radial velocity of 160 km\ns\u22121 and a rotational broadening v sin i of 150 km s\u22121 were used in making this comparison.\nFig. 6.- AV26. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 120 km s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening v sin i of 150 km s\u22121 were used.\nFig. 7.- AV75. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 200 km s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted.\nFig. 8.- AV207. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 95 km s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted.\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- AV296. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 250 km s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 300 km s\u22121 have been adopted.\n\nFig. 10.- AV372. This star is likely a double-lined spectroscopic binary, with two stars\ncontributing to the He I lines, and one star dominating the He II lines.\n\nFig. 11.- AV377. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 180 km s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted.\n\nFig. 12.- AV378. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 190 s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 110 km s\u22121 have been adopted. Note that the scale of\nHe I\u03bb4471 has been changed with respect to earlier figures.\n\nFig. 13.- AV396. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 170 s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted. Note that the scale of\nHe I\u03bb4471 has been changed with respect to Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 14.- AV451. Like AV372 (Fig. 10), this star is judged to be an incipiently resolved\ndouble-lined binary, with two stars contributing He I, and one star dominating the He II\ncontribution. The composite spectral type would be O9.5 III.\n\nFig. 15.- AV469. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 180 s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 110 km s\u22121 have been adopted. Note that the scale of\nHe I\u03bb4471 has been changed with respect to Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 16.- LH64-16. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 290 s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted. The scale of He I \u03bb4471\nhas now been magnified relative to that of earlier figures.\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- LH81:W28-5. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 280 s\u22121 and a\nrotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted.\n\nFig. 18.- LH101:W3-24. The same as Fig. 5, except that a radial velocity of 280 s\u22121 and\na rotational broadening of v sin i of 120 km s\u22121 have been adopted. Note that a cosmetic\ndefect on the redward side of the He II \u03bb4200 line, and the nebular emission at H\u03b2, have\nbeen suppressed in making this figure. The H\u03b1 profile is free of nebular contamination as it\nwas obtained with HST's superior spatial resolution.\n\nFig. 19.- R136-020. In (a) we identify the major lines in the spectrum of R136-020.\nThe data are from the FOS observations of Massey & Hunter (1998), except for the region\n4310\u00c5 to 4590\u00c5, where we have spliced in our higher SNR STIS spectrum. The relatively\nhigh interstellar extinction in the 30 Dor region results in the strong diffuse interstellar band\n(DIB) at \u03bb4430. In (b) we show the match between the model spectra (red) and the observed\nspectrum (black). As in earlier figures, the bars denote a change in intensity of 20%, and the\ntops of the bars denote the continuum level. The He II \u03bb4686 profile is from the FOS data;\nthe rest are from STIS. A rotational velocity of 120 km s\u22121 has been adopted; uncertainties in\nthe zero-point of the STIS wavelength scale prevent accurate radial velocity measurements.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 20.- R136-024. The spectrum of R136-024 is likely a composite of two O3 V stars.\n\nFig. 21.- R136-036. The same as Fig. 19.\n\nFig. 22.- R136-040. The same as Fig. 19.\n\nFig. 23.- R136-047. The same as Fig. 19.\n\nFig. 24.- R136-055. The same as Fig. 19.\n\nFig. 25.- He I\u03bb3187 and He II \u03bb3203. The near-UV region of the spectrum (black) is shown\nfor AV 26 and LH101:W3-24, along with the model fits (red).\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n\nFig. 26.- Effective temperature scale as a function of spectral subtype. The scale on the\nx-axis corresponds to the spectral subtype (2=O2, 5.5=O5.5, 10=B0, 11=B1) for the three\nluminosity classes. The black filled circles are the results of model fits to Galactic stars, taken\nfrom Repolust et al. (2004). The red (LMC) and green (SMC) filled circles are from the\npresent study, while the red (LMC) and green (SMC) triangles are the results of CMFGEN\nmodeling from Crowther et al. (2002), Hillier et al. (2003), and Bouret et al. (2003). The\nsolid line corresponds to the effective temperature scale of Vacca et al. (1996), and the dashed\nline corresponds to the effective temperature scale of Conti (1988).\n\n\fThis figure \"f1.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format
