Their internal affine Lie algebras are all Kac-Moody (KM) algebras based on reductive\nLie algebras. We recall that a reductive Lie algebra g admits a decomposition into a semi-simple\nLie algebra and a direct sum of u(1)'s:\ng = g1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 gn \u2295 u(1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 u(1)\n|\n\n{z\nm\n\n(1)\n\n}\n\ngi is a simple Lie algebra, and n or m may be zero. To the best of our knowledge, all known\nSCAs have an internal KM algebra based on a reductive Lie algebra. In the simple case of\nonly one supercurrent, N = 1, the internal symmetry group is generated by the identity, i.e.,\nn = m = 0.\nThe internal affine Lie algebra of the small N = 4 SCA [1] is based on su(2); the large N = 4\nSCA [2, 3] on su(2)\u2295su(2)\u2295u(1); the middle N = 4 SCA [4] on su(2)\u2295u(1)\u2295u(1)\u2295u(1)\u2295u(1);\nwhile the asymmetric N = 4 SCA [5] is based on su(2) \u2295 u(1) \u2295 u(1). The total number of\ngenerators in the four examples listed above are 8, 16, 16 and 12, respectively. Besides the\nVirasoro generator, the four supercurrents, and the affine Lie algebra generators, the remaining\ngenerators are all spin-1/2 fields.\nIt is possible to extend the asymmetric N = 4 SCA by considering one of the u(1) generators\nas the derivative of a scalar. It is this slightly bigger SCA that is provided in [5].\nHere we shall consider a non-trivial In\u00f6n\u00fc-Wigner (IW) contraction of the large N = 4\nSCA. The resulting algebra is of course closed under (anti-)commutators, whereas the Jacobi\nidentities are not necessarily satisfied. However, we have checked explicitly that they are. They\nread\n0 = (\u22121)ac [Ar , [Bs , Ct }} + (\u22121)ba [Bs , [Ct , Ar }} + (\u22121)cb [Ct , [Ar , Bs }}\n(2)\nwhere a is the parity of the field A etc. [*, *} denotes an anti-commutator when both generators\nare fermionic, i.e., of odd parity. It is otherwise a commutator.\nThe internal symmetry group of the resulting N = 4 SCA turns out to be generated by\nan affine Lie algebra based on the seven-dimensional Lie algebra su(2) \u2295 g, where g is a fourdimensional non-reductive Lie algebra to be discussed below. This novel kind of N = 4 SCA\nhas 16 generators: the Virasoro generator, N = 4 supercurrents, the seven-dimensional affine\nLie algebra, and four spin-1/2 fermions.\nAffine extensions of non-reductive Lie algebras are in general not unique. Thus, the affine\nextension of g that appears in our N = 4 SCA is dictated by the complex structure of the full\nSCA. We classify the possible affine extensions of g, and find that the extension relevant to our\nconstruction differs from the more conventional one governed by the ordinary Cartan-Killing\nform.\nThe guiding principle while considering the particular and somewhat peculiar IW contraction\nalluded to above, was to look for an extension of the recently discovered asymmetric N = 4 SCA\n[5]. Indeed, the latter appears as a subalgebra of the likewise asymmetric new and non-reductive\nN = 4 SCA, rendering its unfamiliar number of 12 generators less mysterious.\nIn the string theoretical context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, some explicit constructions of superconformal algebras have been obtained. The Virasoro algebra was considered in\n1\n\n\f[6], N = 1, 2 and 4 SCAs were discussed in [7], while a general approach to constructing SCAs\non the boundary of AdS3 was outlined in [5]. Those works rely on free field realizations of affine\ncurrent (super-)algebras on the world sheet of the string theory. It would be interesting to see\nhow the new N = 4 SCA presented here fits into that framework. Free field realizations of\ngeneric affine current superalgebras first appeared in [8].\n\n2\n\nLarge N = 4 superconformal algebra\n\nFollowing [3], the large N = 4 SCA is generated by L, Ga , A\u00b1i , U and Qa with a = 1, 2, 3, 4 and\ni = 1, 2, 3. The conformal weights \u2206 for {G, A, U, Q} are {3/2, 1, 1, 1/2}. A and U generate\nan affine su(2) \u2295 su(2) \u2295 u(1) Lie algebra. The large N = 4 SCA is a two-parameter (doubly\nextended) algebra in terms of c and \u03b3 or equivalently k+ and k\u2212 :\nc\n6(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\nk\u2212\n\u03b3= +\nk + k\u2212\n\nc\n,\n6\u03b3\n6k+ k\u2212\n,\nc= +\nk + k\u2212\n\nk\u2212 =\n\nk+ =\n\n(3)\n\nFor convenience of notation, one introduces 4 \u00d7 4-matrices \u03b1 satisfying\n[\u03b1\u00b1i , \u03b1\u00b1j ] = \u2212\n\n3\nX\n\n\u01ebijk \u03b1\u00b1k ,\n\n1\n{\u03b1\u00b1i , \u03b1\u00b1j } = \u2212 \u03b4ij\n2\n\n[\u03b1+i , \u03b1\u2212j ] = 0 ,\n\nk=1\n\n(4)\n\nThey can be represented by\n\u03b1\u00b1i\nab = \u00b1\n\n\u0011 1\n1\u0010 i 4\n\u03b4a \u03b4b \u2212 \u03b4bi \u03b4a4 + \u01ebiab\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nThe large N = 4 SCA may now be written\nc 3\n(n \u2212 n)\u03b4n+m,0\n12\n[Ln , \u03a6r ] = ((\u2206(\u03a6) \u2212 1)n \u2212 r)\u03a6n+r\n\n[Ln , Lm ] = (n \u2212 m)Ln+m +\n\n{Gar , Gbs } = 2\u03b4ab Lr+s \u2212 4(r \u2212 s)\n\n3 \u0010\nX\n\n\u2212i \u2212i\n+i\n\u03b3\u03b1+i\nab Ar+s + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03b1ab Ar+s\n\ni=1\n\nc\n+ (r 2 \u2212 1/4)\u03b4ab \u03b4r+s,0\n3\na\n[A+i\nn , Gr ] =\n\na\n[A\u2212i\nn , Gr ] =\n\n\u00b1j\n[A\u00b1i\nn , Am ] =\n\n4\nX\n\nb=1\n4\nX\n\nb=1\n3\nX\n\n\u0010\n\nb\nb\n\u03b1+i\nab Gn+r \u2212 2(1 \u2212 \u03b3)nQn+r\n\n\u0010\n\nb\nb\n\u03b1\u2212i\nab Gn+r + 2\u03b3nQn+r\n\n\u01ebijk A\u00b1k\nn+m \u2212\n\nk=1\n\na\n[A\u00b1i\nn , Qr ] =\n\n4\nX\n\n\u0011\n\nk\u00b1 ij\nn\u03b4 \u03b4n+m,0\n2\n\nb\n\u03b1\u00b1i\nab Qn+r\n\nb=1\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\f[Un , Gar ] = nQan+r\n[Un , Um ] = \u2212\n{Qar , Gbs } = 2\n\nc\nn\u03b4n+m,0\n12\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n3 \u0010\nX\n\n\u0011\n\n+i\n\u2212i \u2212i\nab\n\u03b1+i\nab Ar+s \u2212 \u03b1ab Ar+s + \u03b4 Ur+s\n\ni=1\n\n{Qar , Qbs }\n\n= \u2212\n\nc\n\u03b4ab \u03b4r+s,0\n12\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n\u2212j\na\n\u00b1i\n0 = [A+i\nn , Am ] = [Un , Qr ] = [Un , Am ]\n\n(6)\n\n\u03a6 is any of the generators G, A, U or Q.\n\n3\n\nNon-reductive N = 4 superconformal algebra\n\nLet us introduce the linearly combined generators\n1 1\n(G \u00b1 iG2 ) ,\n2\n1\n= (Q1 \u00b1 iQ2 ) ,\n2\n\n1\nG\u00b1\u03b2 = (G3 \u00b1 iG4 )\n2\n1\nQ\u00b1\u03b2 = (Q3 \u00b1 iQ4 )\n2\n\nG\u00b1\u03b1 =\nQ\u00b1\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nand\nE \u00b1 = A\u00b12 \u2212 iA\u00b11 ,\n\nH \u00b1 = 2iA\u00b13 ,\n\nF \u00b1 = \u2212A\u00b12 \u2212 iA\u00b11\n\n(8)\n\nWe immediately rescale and rename some of the generators:\n\u03c6\u2212\u03b1 = 2\u03b3Q\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\u03c6\u03b1 = 2Q\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03c6\u2212\u03b2 = 2\u03b3Q\u2212\u03b2\n\u03c6\u03b2 = 2Q\u03b2\n\nJ = E+ ,\n\nV = \u03b3H + ,\n\nE = E\u2212 ,\n\nH = H\u2212 ,\n\nR = \u03b3F +\nF = F\u2212\n\n(9)\n\nNote that E + is not scaled.

For reasons\nwhich will become clear shortly, we have written the many non-vanishing (anti-)commutators\nin two separate families: (12) and (13). Half-integer moding of the fermionic generators G\nand \u03c6 corresponds to a Neveu-Schwarz sector, while integer moding corresponds to a Ramond\nsector.\nThe Jacobi identities (2) are in general not ensured after an IW contraction. However, we\nhave carried out explicitly the tedious job of verifying (2) for the 16 generators of (12) and\n(13). Hence, this new SCA is well-defined. It is asymmetric in the way the supercurrents are\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u2212\u03b2\ntreated, since {G\u2212\u03b1\nr , Gs } = \u2212(r \u2212 s)Rr+s while {Gr , Gs } = 0. This interesting feature was\nalso present in the SCA of [5].\nWe observe that (12) is a subalgebra of the full SCA. When compared to the asymmetric\nSCA of [5], this subalgebra is equivalent to the asymmetric one, provided the spin-1 generator\nR is considered the derivative of the spin-0 generator S of [5]:\nRn = nSn\n\n(14)\n\nThis means that the asymmetric SCA is slightly bigger than (12) since certain commutators\ninvolving S0 are non-vanishing [5].\nIn the extension governed by (13), we can not consider the spin-1 field R straightforwardly\nas the derivative of a spin-0 field S. This follows from the commutator [Jn , Rm ], for example,\nwhere the right hand side involves the spin-1 field V .\nEquivalent, non-reductive N = 4 SCAs may be constructed by similar IW contractions.\nFirst, scaling E + and Q+ instead of F + and Q\u2212 (9) will lead to an isomorphic SCA with the\nroles of G+ and G\u2212 interchanged. Similarly, one could consider the limit \u03b3 \u2192 1 in which case\none would have to scale H \u2212 and either F \u2212 or E \u2212 (and leave H + , E + and F + unscaled). In\nthis limit the central extension becomes c = 6k+ .\n6\n\n\f4\n\nAffine extensions of Lie algebras\n\nLet us conclude by classifying the possible affine extensions of the four-dimensional and nonreductive Lie algebra g. It is generated by the zero-modes {J0 , V0 , R0 , W0 } of the particular\naffine Lie algebra appearing in our construction above:\nc\n[Jn , Rm ] = Vn+m + n\u03b4n+m,0\n6\n[Wn , Jm ] = \u2212Jn+m\nc\n[Wn , Vm ] = \u2212 n\u03b4n+m,0\n6\n[Wn , Rm ] = Rn+m\nc\n[Wn , Wm ] = \u2212 n\u03b4n+m,0\n12\n0 = [Jn , Jm ] = [Vn , Jm ] = [Vn , Vm ] = [Vn , Rm ] = [Rn , Rm ]\n\n(15)\n\nAbbreviating the zero-modes by {J, V, R, W }, the non-vanishing commutators of the algebra g\nare\n[J, R] = V , [W, J] = \u2212J ,\n[W, R] = R\n(16)\nThis algebra is recognized as the semi-direct sum\n \u0304 n3\ng = u(1) \u2295\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the Lie algebra n3 of strictly upper-triangular 3 \u00d7 3-matrices is the biggest non-trivial\nideal of g. The u(1) is generated by {W }, while n3 is generated by {J, V, R}. g is seen to be\nsolvable.\nAn affine extension of the generic Lie algebra\n[ja , jb ] = fab c jc\n\n(18)\n\nis governed by the central extension (or level) k, and a symmetric, bilinear and invariant twoform \u03ba:\n\u03baab = \u03ba(ja , jb )\n\u03ba([ja , jb ], jc ) = \u03ba(ja , [jb , jc ])\n\n(19)\n\nThe resulting affine Lie algebra reads\n[ja,n , jb,m ] = fab c jc,n+m + nk\u03baab \u03b4n+m,0\n\n(20)\n\nThe invariance of \u03ba, in particular, is required by the Jacobi identities of (20). Note that k may\nbe absorbed in a rescaling of \u03ba. However, it is convenient to factorize the extension into the\nLie algebra dependent object \u03ba, and the purely affine entity k. We see that a classification of\npossible affine extensions of a given Lie algebra amounts to classifying the \u03ba-forms of the Lie\nalgebra.\nThe canonical choice of \u03ba-form (19) is the ordinary Cartan-Killing form\n\u03baab = fac d fbd c\n7\n\n(21)\n\n\fFor simple Lie algebras, it is unique up to an overall scaling (the normalization chosen here\nis unconventional but irrelevant to our purpose). For non-reductive Lie algebras, on the other\nhand, there will in general exist several inequivalent \u03ba-forms. Here we shall classify them in the\ncase of g (16).\nThe approach is straightforward and can be applied to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra.\nThe defining properties of the \u03ba-form implies the anti-symmetry\nfcab = \u2212fcba ,\n\nwhere fcab = fca d \u03badb\n\n(22)\n\nIt should be noted that since \u03ba may be degenerate, it in general can not be used as a metric\nwhose inverse can raise indices. Now, considering fcab as a matrix element of the d \u00d7 d-matrix\nfc (d is the dimension of the Lie algebra), the anti-symmetry (22) imposes constraints on \u03ba.\nAlong with the symmetry of \u03ba, \u03baab = \u03baba , those are the only constraints to impose. Thus, the\nclassification is achieved by an analysis of the d matrices fc . In the case of g (16) we find the\ngeneral \u03ba-form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 1\u0304 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u03ba = \u03bb\uf8ec\n(23)\n\uf8f7 + \u03bc\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 1 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 1\n0 1\u0304 0 0\n\nHere 1\u0304 \u2261 \u22121. The matrix elements are labelled according to the order {J, V, R, W }, i.e.,\n\u03ba24 = \u03ba(V, W ) etc. We see that the ordinary Cartan-Killing form corresponds to (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (2, 0),\nwhile the affine extension (15) corresponds to (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (\u22121, 2). In the latter case, the level has\nbeen normalized to k = c/12.\nAs a final comment, we observe that in terms of the linear combinations\nUn+ = Vn \u2212 2Wn ,\n\nUn\u2212 = \u22122Wn\n\n(24)\n\n(15) becomes\nc\n+\n\u2212\n[Jn , Rm ] = Un+m\n\u2212 Un+m\n+ n\u03b4n+m,0\n6\n[Un\u00b1 , Jm ] = 2Jn+m\n[Un\u00b1 , Rm ] = \u22122Rn+m\nc\n\u00b1\n[Un\u00b1 , Um\n] = \u00b1 n\u03b4n+m,0\n3\n\u2212\n0 = [Un+ , Um\n] = [Jn , Jm ] = [Rn , Rm ]\n\n(25)\n\nThus, the affine Lie algebra (15) is seen to contain a level k = c/6 affine su(2) Lie algebra\ngenerated by {J, U + , R}, and a level k = \u2212c/6 affine su(2) Lie algebra generated by {\u2212J, U \u2212 , R}\n(or equivalently by {J, U \u2212 , \u2212R}). We have used the term contain deliberately to emphasize\nthat they are obviously not subalgebras.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks Mark Walton for stimulating discussions and comments on the manuscript,\nand Bruce Campbell for encouragement.
