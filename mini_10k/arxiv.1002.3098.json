Measurements of both the rotation curve and the vertical force field showed that the vertical force puts a\nmuch stronger constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio than rotation curve decomposition. Fitting of the vertical force field derived\nfrom the flaring of the HI layer and HI velocity dispersion revealed that UGC7321 has a spherical halo density distribution with a\nflattening of q = c/a = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. However, the shape of the vertical force field showed that a non-singular isothermal halo was\nrequired, assuming a vertically isothermal HI velocity dispersion. A pseudo-isothermal halo and a gaseous disk with a declining HI\nvelocity dispersion at high latitudes may also fit the vertical force field of UGC7321, but to date there is no observational evidence\nthat the HI velocity dispersion declines away from the galactic plane. We compare the halo flattening of UGC7321 with other studies\nin the literature and discuss its implications. Our result is consistent with new n-body simulations which show that inclusion of\nhydrodynamical modelling produces more spherical halos.\nKey words. galaxies: structure; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: halos; galaxies: ISM\n\n1. Introduction\nIn paper I in this series (O'Brien et al., 2010a) we presented HI\nobservations of a sample of 8 edge-on, HI rich, late-type galaxies. The aim of the project has been described there in detail.\nBriefly, we attempt to put constraints on the flattening of dark halos around disk galaxies by measuring the force field of the halo\nvertically from the flaring of the HI layer and radially from rotation curve decomposition. For the vertical force field we need\nto determine in these galaxies both the velocity dispersion of the\nHI gas (preferably as a function of height from the central plane\nof the disk) and the thickness of the HI layer, all of this as a function of galactocentric radius. In addition we also need to extract\ninformation on the rotation of the galaxy and the deprojected HI\nsurface density, also as a function of galactocentric radius.\nIn paper II (O'Brien et al., 2010b) we discussed methods to\nanalyse the HI observations in edge-on galaxies and presented a\nnew method to measure the radial distributions, rotation curves\nand velocity dispersions. We applied this method to our sample of galaxies in the third paper in this series: O'Brien et al.\n(2010c). In that paper we also developed a new method to derive\nthe thickness of the HI layer, or 'flaring profile', as a function of\n\u22c6\n\nFor correspondence contact Ken Freeman or Piet van der Kruit\n\ngalactocentric radius, which we used to measure the HI flaring\nof each galaxy in our sample.\nIn the present paper we have fitted the vertical shape q =\nc/a of the halo density distribution for the northern galaxy\nUGC7321. This particular system was chosen as a first application since the sensitivity of the HI imaging obtained for\nUGC7321 at the VLA was 5 times greater than that for the\nsouthern galaxies that we observed with the ATCA, allowing\nmore accurate measurement of the gas layer flaring to high latitudes, and better measurement of the HI velocity dispersion.\nDue to its northern location, UGC7321 was not in our initial\nsouthern galaxy sample for which we measured near-IR and optical stellar photometry at Siding Spring Observatory. However,\nVLA HI data observed by Lyn Matthews (Matthews et al., 1999)\nwas available for this galaxy and Michael Pohlen (Pohlen et al.,\n2002) kindly supplied R-band photometry which allowed us to\nderive the stellar luminosity density necessary to analyse the\nhalo density distribution.\nIn Sect. 2 we present the surface brightness and deprojected\nluminosity volume density, and our derivation of the halo core\nradius, halo asymptotic velocity, and stellar mass-to-light ratio\nby rotation curve decomposition. In Sect. 3, we present a new\nsimple method used to measure the halo shape using the vertical gradient of the vertical force, dKz /dz, with the usual assumption of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium to determine the total\n\n\f2\n\nJ.C.

The resulting halo shape measurement for\nUGC7321 is presented and discussed in Sect. 4, and compared\nto other measurements of dark halo flattening in Sect. 5. Sect. 6\nsummarizes our conclusions.\n\n2. Stellar surface brightness and deprojected\nluminosity density of UGC7321\nFig. 1 shows the R-band surface brightness \u2013 averaged over four\nquadrants \u2013 of UGC7321 with contours ranging from 0.1 to 30\nL\u2299 pc\u22122 in steps of 0.5 dex. The observations and photometric\ncalibration of UGC7321 are discussed in Pohlen et al. (2002).\nPohlen et al. (2003) analysed the projected surface brightness\nshowing peanut-shaped deviations from elliptical fits to the\nisophotes at z heights greater than 0.5 kpc above the plane. These\ndeviations provide strong evidence of a stellar bar, although it is\ndifficult to measure the scale of the bar from the scale of the\nboxy-peanut shaped bulge (Athanassoula, private communication).\nUsing an exponential radial surface profile we fit the central\nsurface brightness and apparent radial scale length of the projected surface density. In logarithmic units\n\u03bc(X) = \u03bc0 + 1.086(X/hX ) mag arcsec\u22122 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere X denotes the major axis distance. We found the projected central R-band surface brightness to be 22.0 mag arcsec\u22122 ,\nwith a scalelength of 4.0 \u00b1 0.3 kpc, in agreement with that\nmeasured by Pohlen et al. (2003). The projected central surface\nbrightness is consistent with the B and R-band measurement by\nMatthews et al. (1999) when the internal extinction model that\nMatthews et al. used is factored in. The projected surface brightness shows a small nuclear feature smaller than 1 kpc, and an\nexponential profile from 0.5 to 6.5 kpc, declining steeply after 7\nkpc.\n2.1. Deprojection\n\nTo deproject the luminosity distribution from the edge-on projection, we assume azimuthal symmetry and perform a direct\ndeprojection of the projected surface density on the sky using\nthe inverse Abel transform\nZ\n\u22121 \u221e\ndI(X, z)\n1\nI(R, z) =\ndX,\n(2)\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u03c0 R\ndX\nX \u2212R\n\nwhere X is the position along the major axis and R is the galactocentric radius in the cylindrical coordinate system. Applying\nthe inverse Abel tranform to each z-plane yields the luminous\nvolume density I(R, z) of the galaxy in L\u2299 pc\u22123 as a function\n\nFig. 2. Stellar luminosity volume density in R and z after deprojecting the observed surface density using the Inverse Abel\nIntegral. Contours are separated on a log scale at 0.0001, 0.003,\n0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 L\u2299 pc\u22123 . The radial and vertical\nscalelengths, as shown in Fig. 3, are hR = 2.65 kpc and hz = 245\npc.\n\nof cylindrical radius R and height z. To minimise the incidence\nof local regions with a negative derivative dI(X, z)/dX, we performed the deprojection after smoothing the projected surface\ndensity by several different 2D Gaussians with FWHM ranging\nfrom 256 pc to 1027 pc (or 10 and 40 pixels, respectively).\nFig. 2 shows the derived volume density I(R, z) of UGC7321,\nwhile Fig. 3 shows the radial and vertical surface brightness obtained by integrating over the volume density. UGC7321 is indeed a very low surface brightness galaxy. The face-on radial\nscalelength is hR = 2.65 \u00b1 0.17 kpc. Both the volume density\nand the radial profile, show that UGC7321 clearly has a small\ncentral nuclear region that is approximately 8 times brighter in\nsurface brightness than the fitted central surface brightness of\n\u03bcR = 23.4 \u00b1 0.14 mag arcsec\u22122 derived assuming an exponential disk only. The peak face-on central surface brightness of the\nnuclear region is \u03bcR = 21.1 mag arcsec\u22122 .\nThe central luminosity volume density of UGC7321 is 0.3\nL\u2299 pc\u22123 in the central nucleus averaged over 250 pc. At 2.2 scalelengths the midplane volume density is 0.002 L\u2299 pc\u22123 , much less\nthan the luminosity density near the Sun (\u2248 0.1 L\u2299 pc\u22122 ) as would\nbe expected for such a low surface brightness galaxy.\n2.2. Rotation curve decomposition\n\nIn the standard manner we decomposed the rotation curve to obtain the parameters of a spherical pseudo-isothermal halo, and\nconstrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio. The radial surface density of the stars and gas was used directly to derive the rotation\ncurve contribution due to each luminous mass component, and\nthe observed rotation curve fitted such that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(3)\nv2h = v2obs \u2212 v2s + v2g ,\nwhere vobs (R) is the observed rotation curve, and vh (R), v s (R)\nand vg (R) are the rotation due to the halo, stellar and gas mass\ncomponents, respectively. The radial surface density of each luminous component was obtained by integrating over z, and a\nconstant R-band stellar M/LR was adopted. The HI surface density was scaled by a factor of 1.4 to include He and (a minimal\namount of) molecular gas.\nThe observed rotation curve was fitted using a spherical\npseudo-isothermal halo density distribution\n\u03c1h (R) = \u03c1h,0\n\nR2c\nR2 + R2c\n\n(4)\n\n\fJ.C.

This similarity implies that the measured\nasymptotic rotation derived from a spherical pseudo-isothermal\nfit to the rotation curve also defines the asymptotic rotation of a\nflattened pseudo-isothermal halo via Eqn. (11).\nIn Fig. 4 we show how the rotation curve of a flattened\npseudo-isothermal halo varies with q (for q \u2264 1) at z=0. The\nvertical axis shows the rotation normalised by the asymptotic rotation vh,\u221e (q), while the abscissa shows the radius normalised by\nthe core radius Rc . The thick, black curve shows the rotation for\nq = 0.3, while the thin, red curve shows the rotation for q = 0.9\nwith the radius scaled by 0.84. The nearly identical shape of the\ntwo curves shows that shape of the rotation curve of the halo is\nalmost independent of q, with the radial scaling varying by only\n\u2248 15% over a large range of q. The derived halo central density does vary significantly with q, becoming denser for more\nflattened halos:\n\u03c1h,0 (q) =\n\nv2h,\u221e (q = 1)\n4\u03c0 G\n\nR2c\n\n1\n,\nf (q)\n\n(13)\n\nIn Sect. 4 we measure q by fitting the gradient of the vertical force dKz /dz, where the gradient of the flattened pseudoisothermal halo is also given by Sackett et al. (1994). As Kz (R, z)\nalso depends on the same parameters q, halo core radius Rc and\nhalo central density \u03c1h,0 , we can use the asymptotic halo rotation\nvh,\u221e and the core radius Rc which are well measured from rotation curve decomposition, and just perform a single parameter\n\n\f4\n\nJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\nfit to the flattening q, as the central density \u03c1h,0 is tied to vh,\u221e , Rc\nand q.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the best fitting stellar and halo rotation\ncurves derived from rotation curve decomposition of UGC7321.\nThe observed rotation curve is shown by the thick black line,\nwhile the rotation due to gas, stars and the halo are shown by\ndashed lines (from the bottom up stars (red), gas (green) and\nhalo (blue). The resulting fit is shown by the grey full-drawn\nline (yellow). The best fit was achieved with a sub-maximal (see\nbelow) stellar M/LR of 1.05, which scaled the stellar component\nfrom a luminosity of L = 4.0 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 to a mass of 4.2 \u00d7 108\nM\u2299 . UGC7321 is a gas-rich low surface brightness galaxy with\na MHI /LR = 2.2; thus even with an M/LR near unity, the stellar\nmass is roughly a third of the gas mass (Mg = 1.4MHI ).\nThe plot shows that the rotation curve is well fit by a pseudoisothermal halo with core radius Rc = 0.52 \u00b1 0.02 kpc, and central density \u03c1h,0 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.05 M\u2299 pc\u22123 . As the halo core radius\nand halo asymptotic rotation are nearly independent of the halo\nshape in flattened pseudo-isothermal halos, we adopt those measurements from rotation curve decomposition for our halo shape\nmodelling in Sect. 3. The halo is clearly the dominant component\nat all radii, comprising over 90% of the total galaxy mass of 3.2\u00d7\n1010 M\u2299 at the last measured point. Uson & Matthews (2003)\nreach a very similar conclusion. UGC7321 has a similar dark-tolight mass ratio, although it is significantly more massive than\nDDO154 and shows evidence of a bar (Carignan & Freeman,\n1988).\nThe dominance of the halo at all radii means that the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio is rather unconstrained. Forcing a maximum\ndisk fit yielded a stellar M/LR of 2.9, but resulted in a very poor\nfit with rotation velocities in error by 15-25% in the inner disk.\nEven with a maximum disk fit, the peak rotation for the stellar\ndisk was only 43 km s\u22121 . The best fit occurs for an M/LR of 1.05,\nbut all M/LR values less than 1.05 provide acceptable fits to the\nrotation curve. Consequently, we use 1.05 as an upper limit in\nthe analysis in Sect. 3.\nThe low mass-to-light ratio and extremely sub-maximal nature of the UGC7321 stellar disk implies that the recent star\nformation rate exceeds the average rate over the galaxy's lifetime. Observations by Matthews et al. (1999) that found a significant fraction of young stars support our results. Detailed studies\nof the vertical disk structure indicate multiple disk components\n(Matthews, 2000). Our finding of a very low mass-to-light ratio (in the R-band) warrants further studies of the structure and\ncomposition of the stellar disk, but this is beyond the scope of\nthe present paper.\n\n3. Method for fitting the halo shape\nThe thickness of the gas layer depends on the vertical force Kz ,\nand hence on the shape of the dark matter halo (Maloney, 1992;\nOlling & van Gorkom, 1993; Kundic et al., 1993; Maloney,\n1993). A gas layer with less flaring for a given gas velocity dispersion implies a stronger Kz .\nAnalytically it has been shown that at large radii the thickness of the gas layer is roughly proportional to the square root\nof the halo flattening q (Maloney, 1993; Olling, 1995) and that\nthe flaring should increase radially in an exponential fashion\n(van der Kruit, 1981). This was confirmed in our measurements\nand the earlier study of Rupen (1991) comprising high resolution\nVLA HI observations of NGC891 and NGC4565.\nWe determine the halo flattening by measuring the z-gradient\nof the total vertical force Kz,tot (R, z) from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the gas layer, and evaluating dKz /dz for\n\nFig. 5. Rotation curve decomposition of UGC7321. The observed rotation curve is shown by the thick (black) line, while\nthe rotation due to the other components are shown by dashed\nlines; from the bottom up stars (red), gas (green) and the halo\n(blue).

The\nhalo gradient dKz,h /dz is modelled using the equation for the\nvertical force Kz of a flattened pseudo-isothermal halo given in\nSackett et al. (1994).\nGiven the gas disk is in equilibrium, the gas pressure gradient\nand internal forces must exactly balance the gradient of the total\ngravitational potential of the galaxy, where the total gravitational\npotential \u03a6tot is the sum of the stellar, gas and halo potentials,\n\u03a6tot = \u03a6h + \u03a6 s + \u03a6g . Assuming that the gas velocity dispersion\nis isothermal in z (though not in R), the equilibrium condition in\nz becomes\n\u22022 2\n\u2202Kz (R, z)\n.\n(14)\n[\u03c3v,g (R) ln\u03c1g (R, z)] =\n2\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\nIf we further assume that the gas density distribution is\nGaussian in z, the vertical gradient of the total Kz becomes a\nsimple function of the gas velocity dispersion and the vertical\nFWHM thickness of the gas, both functions of radius which we\nmeasured in paper III, namely\n\u03c32v,g (R)\n\u2202Kz,tot (R, z)\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2202z\n(FWHMz,g (R)/2.355)2\n\n(15)\n\nFrom this we see that the vertical gradient of Kz,tot derived from\nsuch a gas disk is constant in z, and varying in R.\nThe gradient of the vertical force of each of the luminous\ncomponents was directly calculated from the Poisson equation\nfor each component\n\u2202Kz (R, z)\n1 \u2202(RKR )\n= \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1(R, z) +\n,\n(16)\n\u2202z\nR \u2202R\nwhere \u03c1(R, z), KR , and Kz correspond to the volume density and\nforces of that component.

O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\n5\n\nFig. 6. The vertical gradient of the vertical force. The total gradient, dKz,tot /dz determined from hydrostatics is shown as the thick,\nblack line (labelled 'total'), while the gradients for the gas and stars is shown in green and red (and labelled 'gas' and 'stars'),\nrespectively. The stellar gradient dKz,s /dz is calculated using the stellar mass-to-light ratio of M/LR = 1.05 \u00b1 0.33, derived from\nrotation curve decomposition. This value of the stellar M/LR is clearly too high as the gradient allowed for the halo (shown in\nblue and labelled 'halo') is positive at all radii, requiring negative halo densities. The stellar M/LR needs to be reduced to allow a\nnegative halo gradient dKz,h /dz. The cyan line (labelled 'halo+stars') shows the sum of stellar and halo components determined by\ndKz,tot /dz \u2212 dKz,g /dz, which must be fitted with a non-negligible stellar M/LR and a positive density halo.\nConsequently, the gradient of the halo force must satisfy\n\u2202Kz,h (R, z)\n\u2202Kz,tot (R, z) \u2202Kz,s (R, z)\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202Kz,g (R, z)\n,\n\u2202z\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the subscripts s, g and h, denote the stars, gas and halo,\nrespectively.\nThe vertical \u2202Kz,h (R, z)/\u2202z force of the flattened pseudoisothermal halo is given in Sackett et al. (1994). As the asymptotic halo rotation and the halo core radius were well determined\nfrom the rotation curve decomposition, and the central density\ndetermined by q, the fitting of dKz,h /dz reduces to a fit with a\nsingle parameter q.\nComparison of the stellar vertical force gradient with the total vertical force gradient shows that the vertical force puts a\nmuch stronger constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio than\ndoes the radial force fitting undertaken in rotation curve decomposition. Inclusion of the gas self-gravity requires that the stellar\nvertical force gradient dKz,s (R, z)/dz must be\ndKz,s (z) dKz,tot (z) dKz,g (z)\n<\n\u2212\ndz\ndz\ndz\n\n(19)\n\nwhere from here on we take the R-dependence of Kz as implicit\nand write the derivatives as total derivatives.\nGiven that the stellar mass density and its squared rotation\nare both proportional to the stellar mass-to-light ratio, we see\nfrom Eqn. (17) that the vertical gradient of the vertical force of\n\nthe stars is linearly related to the stellar mass-to-light ratio. As\nthe low stellar luminosity meant the rotation curve decomposition was relatively insensitive to the stellar mass-to-light ratio,\nwe consider the stellar mass-to-light ratio to be a free parameter\nand fitted\ndKz,tot dKz,g\n\u2212\ndz\ndz\nas determined from the observations as a function of R with\ndKz,h dKz,s\n+\n,\ndz\ndz\nwhere the Kz,h is modelled by the flattened pseudo-isothermal\nhalo and the z-gradient of the stellar vertical force is\ndKz,s \u0012 M \u0013 dKz,s\n=\ndz\nL\ndz\n\n.\nM/LR =1\n\nThe total Kz gradient and the gas Kz gradient come directly from\nobservations without any free parameters.\nWe recall from above that the vertical gradient of Kz,tot derived for a Gaussian gas disk is independent of z. To be most sensitive to the constraints from the luminous mass density, we fit\nthe gradient of the vertical force near the midplane at z = 100 pc,\nhigh enough to avoid the bulk of the internal extinction caused\nby dust in the plane of the thin stellar disk.\n\n\f6\n\nJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\n4. The halo shape of UGC7321\n4.1. Results of the fitting\n\nFig. 6 shows the vertical gradient of each of the Kz components\nfor UGC7321. The thick, black line (labelled 'total') is the gradient determined from the gas flaring and velocity distribution\nusing Eqn. (15). The gradient due to the stellar disk is shown by\nthe red line (labelled 'stars') and has been calculated with the\nmass-to-light ratio of 1.05, which was the best fitting value in\nour rotation curve decomposition. We see immediately that the\nstellar dKz,s /dz alone is comparable to the total dKz,tot /dz given\nby the hydrostatics over most of the range of R. The gradient due\nto the HI is the line labelled 'gas' (green). We can subtract this\ngradient for the gas from the total gradient and derive the gradient due to the sum of the halo and the stars. This is the (cyan) line\nlabelled 'halo+stars'. Subtracting the gradient for the stars from\nthe gradient for the (halo + stars) then leaves the gradient that\nshould be attributed to the halo alone (blue line labelled 'halo').\nWith the adopted M/L ratio for the stellar disk, the halo gradient\nturns out to be positive, which is unphysical.\nFrom this example, it is clear that the gradient of Kz,tot measured from the hydrostatics provides a very strong constraint on\nthe stellar M/LR ratio. Even with a zero-mass halo, which is excluded by the rotation curve fit, we see that the stellar M/LR must\nbe less than 1 to leave room for the gradient of Kz given by the\ngas self-gravity. With the necessary inclusion of the gas, we find\n< 0.6. The difthat the stellar mass-to-light ratio M/LR must be \u223c\nference dKz,tot /dz \u2212 dKg /dz (cyan; labelled 'halo+stars') constitutes the combined dKz /dz of the halo (blue; labelled 'halo') and\nstars (red; labelled 'stars'). The rotation curve decomposition requires a positive halo mass density at all radii, thus dKz,h /dz < 0\nfor all radii. This constraint requires that the stellar M/LR \u226a 1.\nInspection of the dKz,tot /dz \u2212 dKz,g /dz difference (cyan;\n'halo+stars') shows a steep gradient at small R, flattening at large\nradii, particularly where the gas layer undergoes exponential\nflaring at radii outside 7 kpc. We see from Fig. 7 that this is similar to the characteristic shape of dKz,h /dz for pseudo-isothermal\nhalos with different halo flattenings. But despite this similarity, it\nwas not possible to fit the halo flattening q while holding the core\nradius Rc and the asymptotic halo rotation vh,\u221e fixed, even with a\nzero mass stellar distribution (stellar M/LR = 0) and allowing q\nto range between oblate and prolate shapes. By adjusting q, and\nkeeping M/LR | stars small, it is possible to get a similar shape to\nthe difference gradient (cyan; 'halo+stars'), but it is always offset to larger negative values of the gradient. This implies that the\nasymptotic halo rotation scale derived from the rotation curve is\ntoo high, as the magnitude of dKz,h /dz is proportional to the v2h,\u221e\n(see Sackett et al., 1994).\nThis may be an artefact of the adopted pseudo-isothermal\nhalo model. While the flattened pseudo-isothermal (PIT) model\nis computationally convenient, we note that a true (spherical)\nnon-singular isothermal (IT) model was initially adopted for\ndark halos (Carignan & Freeman 1985, 1988). Few studies have\ncompared the relative merits of the PIT and IT dark halo models. In their paper on halo scaling laws for disk galaxies (Sc and\nlater) and dwarf speroidals, Kormendy & Freeman (2004) compare halo fits to rotation curves over a large sample and generate\nscaling laws between halo parameters measured with a IT halo\nand those with a PIT halo. In Fig. 8 (adapted from Fig. 1 of\nKormendy & Freeman, 2004), we show IT and PIT halo rotation\nscaled to the same asymptotic rotation. As can be seen, the rotation of the IT halo rises above the asymptotic rotation speed before declining to it at large radii, while the rotation curve of a PIT\n\nFig. 7. The vertical gradient equated near the midplane of a flattened pseudo-isothermal halo, as calculated from Eqn. (6) of\nSackett et al. (1994) for both oblate and prolate halos ranging\nfrom q of 0.5 to 1.5 in steps of 0.1. The bottom curve corresponds\nto the most flattened halo with q = 0.5, becoming increasingly\nshallow as the halo gets less flat. The gradient of a spherical\nhalo is shown by the dashed line. The top curve corresponds to\nq = 1.5.\n\nhalo approaches the asymptotic rotation from below. The declining shape of the rotation curve for the IT model would provide\na lower and possibly more realistic estimate of the asymptotic\nrotational velocity vh,\u221e from a rotation curve decomposition of\nrotation data which in practice does not extend to radii in excess\nof a few halo core radii.\nIf an IT halo was fitted to the observed rotation curve of\nUGC7321, the asymptotic rotation would be approximately 2040% lower than that of the PIT halo. This would provide the\nlower asymptotic rotation scale vh,\u221e necessary to fit the difference dKz /dz of UGC7321 with a flattened halo over radial\nranges from 1.5 to 9 kpc.\nFlattened non-singular isothermal halos could be formed by\nhalo rotation or anisotropy of the velocity dispersion. The rotation is unlikely to be figure rotation, as figure rotation of triaxial\nhalos measured in n-body simulations was found to be very slow\n(Bailin & Steinmetz, 2004) (0.148 h km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , where h is\nH0 /100, insufficient to flatten halos more than q \u223c 0.7). The velocity dispersion anisotropy of the halo dark matter would allow\neither prolate or oblate halos, just as velocity anisotropy of the\nstars in the brighter elliptical galaxies defines the galaxy shape.\nWith the asymptotic rotation as a free parameter in addition\nto the stellar M/LR and q, we found that the residual dKz /dz\ncurve ('halo+stars', cyan) is best modelled with a halo shape of\nq = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. Robust least squares minimization fitting using a\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm (MINPACK-1) favoured a zero\nmass stellar disk, but fits were almost as good for an M/LR = 0.2\nstellar disk. These fits were successful over the radial range from\n2 \u2212 9 kpc.\n\n\fJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\nFig. 8. This figure shows the difference in the rotation curve and\nvelocity dispersion of isothermal and pseudo-isothermal halo\nmodels. The top panel shows that rotation of an IT halo rises\nabove the asymptotic rotation speed at large radii, before declining to it, while the rotation curve of a PIT halo approaches the\nasymptotic rotation from below. Both rotation curves are scaled\nto the same asymptotic rotation speed to allow comparison. The\nlower panel shows that an isotropic pseudo-isothermal halo is\nnot isothermal, exhibiting a lower velocity dispersion at low\nradii. (Adapted from Fig. 1 of Kormendy & Freeman, 2004.)\n\nWe illustrate this first for the unphysical case where there is\nno mass in stars in Fig. 9. This figure is organised in the same\nmanner as Fig. 6. The gradient due to the stars is now zero at all\nz. Recall that the (cyan) line 'halo+stars' is the observed gradient, which has to be fit. The smooth (also cyan) line 'halo' is that\nfit (the dashed -blue- line superimposed is that of the halo alone,\nwhich is the same when M/LR is zero). This best fit was achieved\nwith an asymptotic PIT halo rotation reduced by 30 \u00b1 5% compared to the PIT fit to the rotation curve in Fig. 5.\nIt is remarkable that the shape of the R-dependence of\ndKz /dz for the adopted halo model in Fig. 9 agrees so well with\nthe shape of the Kz gradient derived from the HI flaring and\nvelocity dispersion, at least for radii < 9 kpc. Although some\nrescaling of the strength of the Kz force was needed, we see that\nthe density distribution of the adopted spherical PIT, using the\ncore radius derived from the rotation curve fit, also provides the\ncorrect radial variation of the Kz gradient. This need not have\nhappened. Although the KR estimate from the rotation curve\nand the hydrostatic estimate of dKz /dz come from analysing the\nsame XV data (see paper III), the two functions come from different features in the XV data, so are relatively independent.\nIn Fig. 10 we show the fit for a stellar M/LR = 0.2 disk.\nThe lines labelled 'halo+stars' (cyan) show the gradient as deduced from the observed total gradient minus that of the gas in\nthe full-drawn line (which of course is the same as in Fig. 9)\nand that of the sum of the gradient of the halo model fit and\nthat deduced from the stellar distribution with M/LR = 0.2 as\n\n7\n\nthe dashed line. The gradient from the stellar disk alone is the\n(red) curve labelled 'stars' and for the halo the (blue) curve labelled 'halo'. For this case an asymptotic halo rotation reduction of 50 \u00b1 5% was needed. In effect, reducing vh,\u221e and reducing the stellar M/LR have similar effects of increasing the magnitude of the asymptotic value of the difference dKz /dz curve\n('halo+stars',cyan). For both cases (M/LR = 0 in Fig. 9 and\nM/LR = 0.2 in Fig. 10), the shape of this difference dKz /dz\ncurve dictated (given the derived core radius for the dark halo\nfrom our rotaton curve decomposition) a halo flattening close to\nspherical.\nAt radii larger than 9 kpc, the strong flaring causes the difference dKz /dz (cyan, 'halo+stars') to be too small to be fit with\nthe same asymptotic halo rotation. Even the shallow gradient\nof dKz /dz given by a highly prolate halo, combined with a low\nvh,\u221e , did not produce a good fit at these radii. We briefly discuss\nwhy the derived gradient for halo+stars may have been underestimated.\nWe have argued that a true isothermal halo may provide a\nmore valid model for this analysis. Another possibility is that\nthe gas velocity dispersion is not vertically isothermal. We were\nforced to adopted this assumption in the hydrostatic equation,\nbecause there is currently no available measurements of the zdependence of the gas velocity dispersion.1 Prior to our work the\ngas velocity dispersion had only been measured in a few face-on\ngalaxies. Our HI disk modelling of edge-on galaxies has more\nthan doubled the number of galaxies with radial gas velocity dispersion measurements. These high resolution observations show\nthat the gas velocity dispersion is not isothermal in radius, but\nits vertical properties are unknown and we had to assume that is\nis vertically isothermal.\nThe gas velocity dispersion in disk galaxies is often ascribed\nto local heating by supernovae and stellar winds in star formation regions. Indeed, Shostak & van der Kruit (1984) found in\nNGC628 that the gas velocity dispersion is systematically higher\nin the spiral arms than in between. On the other hand, similar velocity dispersions are seen in regions of star formation and in regions where there is no visible star formation (e.g. Meurer et al.,\n1996), and both low and high surface brightness galaxies seem to\nhave similar gas velocity dispersion. Sellwood & Balbus (1999)\noffer a plausible alternative, suggesting that weak magnetic\nfields in galaxies allow energy to be extracted from differential\nrotation via MHD-driven turbulence. This would result in a gas\nvelocity dispersion that was proportional to the rotational shear\ndue to the disk, resulting in similar gas velocity dispersion for\ngalaxies with similar rotation curves. However, while heating\ncaused by gas shear could generate radial variation in the gas\nvelocity dispersion, it is unclear how it could cause the gas velocity dispersion not to be vertically isothermal. Conversely, the\ndecline in star formation away from the midplane could cause a\nfall-off in gas velocity dispersion with z.\nA non-isothermal vertical gas velocity dispersion would\nprobably have more of an effect at larger radii where the flaring gas is probing a larger range in z. A gas velocity dispersion\ndeclining with z would increase the absolute total vertical gradient of Kz derived from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.\nA significant increase of dKz,tot /dz would enable a larger asymptotic halo rotation more consistent with a pseudo-isothermal halo\nand a larger stellar M/LR .\n1\nBecause of S/N limitations, our measurement of the gas velocity\ndispersion in paper III models the HI XV diagram integrated over z.\nThus it represents a luminosity-weighted average dispersion as a function of radius.\n\n\f8\n\nJ.C.

The green ('gas') and red (coincident with the abcissa\nat the top of the figure) curves show the z-gradient derived using Poisson's equation for the gas and stellar mass components. The\ncyan ('halo+stars') line shows the difference dKz,tot /dz \u2212 dKz,g /dz. This line is fitted by the halo gradient dKz,h /dz which is modelled\nby a flattened pseudo-isothermal halo. To achieve a successful fit to the cyan line, the asymptotic halo rotation was scaled down by\n30%. The measured halo flattening was q = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. The vertical dotted (cyan) lines show the radial regime used for the fit.\nAnother, less plausible, explanation of the dKz /dz fitting\nproblem at large radius, is that the gas-to-HI ratio used to scale\nthe HI density to account for He and H2 is not constant. This is\nunlikely as the He content is mainly primordial and well known\nfrom big bang nucleo-synthesis. As He accounts for 0.34 of\nthe additional 0.4 fraction, it is unlikely that a radially declining molecular hydrogen distribution could significantly reduce\ndKz,g /dz thus allowing a higher difference dKz /dz (cyan).\n\n5. Comparison to other work\nWe first review earlier work on the flattening of dark halos in\nspiral galaxies. The earliest concern was whether the dark matter\nindicated by flat rotation curves resided indeed in a more or less\nround halo or was part of the disk. That the latter was not the\ncase was shown in 1981, using evidence from bulge isophotes\nin external galaxies and star counts in our Galaxy (Monet et al.,\n1981) and from HI flaring in NGC 891 (van der Kruit, 1981).\nNext, the question of the actual flattening q = c/a of dark halos\nin spiral galaxies arose and we will now review previous work on\nthis subject, starting with our Galaxy. One of the early methods\nis the analysis of the local surface density in the Solar neighbourhood using stellar kinematics. With this method Binnet et al.\n(1987) find 0.3 \u2264 q \u2264 0.6, van der Marel (1991) q \u2265 0.34 and\n> 0.5.\nBienaym\u00e9 et al. (2006) q \u223c\nAt large radial distances of 8.0 \u2264 R \u2264 60 kpc, RR Lyrae\nstars show the dark matter distribution to be flattened by q \u223c\n0.7 (Amendt & Cuddeford, 1994). Hyper-velocity stars open another promising way of probing the shape of the Galactic dark\nmatter distribution. One star, assuming it is 70 kpc away, gives\n\n0.5 < q < 1.6 (Gnedin et al., 2005). Samurovi\u0107 et al. (1999)\nused the microlensing optical depth towards the Galactic bulge,\nLMC, SMC and M31 to probe the shape of the Galactic halo to\nlarge radii (R \u2264 5R25 ). However, they were not able to derive\nstrong constraints: q = 0.6 \u00b1 0.4.\nSince the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, modelling of its extended stellar tidal debris stream has become\none of the most promising methods. Majewski et al. (2003)\nshow that the Sagittarius stream traces a great circle around our\nGalaxy, extending to radii of 2R25 from the Galactic centre. If\nthe tidal debris has made several orbits, the Galactic halo must\nbe near-spherical so that the stream does not precess away from\na single plane. Merrifield (2004) argued that the apparent coherency of the carbon star kinematics in the stream suggest that\nall the stars are on the same wrap, making it impossible to constrain the halo flattening. Conversely, Ibata et al. (2001) contend\nthat the stream has made several orbits, and from this infer that\n> 0.7 in the radial range\nthe Galactic halo must have flattening q \u223c\n16 < R < 60 kpc.\nRecently, numerically modelling of small satellite infall on a\nSgr-like orbit by Helmi (2004a) finds that tidal streams younger\nthan about 2 Gyr lead to spatially coherent streams for a large\nrange of halo flattenings 0.6 \u2264 q \u2264 1.6. Since then she (Helmi,\n2004b) has significantly revised her initial measurement to a\n< q < 1.5 by constraining the\nhighly prolate shape with 1.25 \u223c\n\u223c\nstar sample to the older Sgr stream stars of Law et al. (2005).\nHowever, Johnston et al. (2005) dispute this result, finding a\nnear-spherical halo with q \u223c 0.83 \u2212 0.92. In a more recent analysis of the Magellanic Stream R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka et al. (2007) find a flattening of 0.74 \u2264 q \u2264 1.20.\n\n\fJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\n9\n\nFig. 10. The z-gradient of the vertical force showing successful fits of the halo shape for stellar mass-to-light ratio M/LR = 0.2.\nThe curve are coloured as in Fig. 9, except that the line for the stars is now at non-zero values. The cyan line, labelled 'halo+stars',\nshows again the difference dKz,tot /dz \u2212 dKz,g /dz which is fitted by the stellar gradient dKz,s /dz derived from Poisson's equation\nand the halo gradient dKz,h /dz which is modelled by a flattened pseudo-isothermal halo. To achieve a successful fit to this line, the\nasymptotic halo rotation was scaled down by 50%. The thin full-drawn (blue) line, labelled 'halo' corresponds to this halo, while\nthe dashed (cyan) line shows the gradient due to this halo and that of the stars together. A stellar mass-to-light ratio significantly\nlarger than 0.2 was not possible. Again, the measured halo flattening was q = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. The vertical dotted (cyan) lines show the\nradial regime used for each fit.\nThe situation for halo shape measurement in external galaxies is just as confusing, because some methods are suited only\nto specific types of galaxies. The determination of halo shape\nfrom polar ring galaxies is such a case. By simply comparing the\nequatorial and polar rotation curves it is possible to ascertain the\nflattening of the total potential. Using this method NGC4650A\nand A0136-0801 were found to be moderately flattened with\n> 0.7 (Whitmore et al., 1987; Schweizer et al., 1983, respecq\u223c\ntively), while MCG-5-7-1 was found to be approximately spherical (Whitmore et al., 1987). A potentially more accurate method\nis to model the rotation along both axes using a multi component mass model comprising bulge, equatorial stellar and\ngas disks, and polar stellar and gas rings. Using this method,\nSackett & Sparke (1990) originally found the halo flattening of\nNGC4650A to be 0.3 \u2264 q \u2264 0.7; subsequent higher quality observations were able to constrain the halo more tightly,\nto 0.3 \u2264 q \u2264 0.4 (Sackett et al., 1994). This method has also\nbeen applied to AM2020-504, where the flattening was found\nto be q \u223c 0.6 (Arnaboldi et al., 1993). Another method involves\nmodelling of the twisting caused by precession of the ring. With\nsome specific assumptions, Steiman-Cameron et al. (1992) constrain the flattening of the NGC4753 halo to be 0.84 \u2264 q \u2264 0.99.\nFinally, using the twisting of the morphological minor axis of\nthe disk plane away from the kinematic minor axis to model the\nvelocity field of polar rings, the flattening of the dark halo of\nA0136-0801 was found to be q \u223c 0.6 (Sackett & Pogge, 1995).\nAnother method that has been used to measure halo flattening is strong gravitational lensing. An early study of a\n\n> 0.4\ndouble lens system comprising two spirals found q \u223c\n(Koopmans et al., 1998). More recently there have been\n> 0.4\ntwo studies of multiple quad lens systems finding q \u223c\n(Rusin & Tegman, 2110) and q \u223c 0.7 (Cohn & Kochanek,\n2004), and another analysis of a double lens system 0.6 < q <\n0.7 (Chae et al., 2002).\nWarps in stellar disks (e.g. Reshetnikov & Combes, 1998)\noffer several mechanisms to probe the halo shape of spiral galaxies. One method uses the precession of the warped disk to constrain the halo flattening. It has been applied to NGC2903, yielding a halo flattening of q = 0.80\u00b10.15 (Hofner & Sparke, 1994).\nIt is also possible to measure the mean shape of vast numbers of galaxies via weak gravitational lensing. Measurements of\nabout 105 lensed systems against about 106 background galaxies\n(Hoekstra et al., 2005) find a mean projected halo ellipticity of\n+0.04\n0.20+0.04\n\u22120.05 and a mean projected halo flattening of hqi = 0.66\u22120.06\n(1-\u03c3 error) . However, a larger investigation of about 2 million\nlensed galaxies against 32 million background galaxies from\nthe SDSS dataset found no strong evidence of flattening, with\nhqi = 0.99+0.06\n\u22120.05 (Mandelbaum et al., 2006).\nThe results of halo flattening studies so far do not reveal a\nconsistent picture. We believe that the method of the flaring of\nthe gas layer is among the most promising, at least for latetype spiral galaxies. First tried by Celnik et al. (1979) on the\nGalaxy, early development of the method was undertaken by\nvan der Kruit (1981) who applied it to low resolution observations of NGC891, concluding that the halo was not as flattened\nas the stellar disk. It was then applied to several galaxies in the\n\n\f10\n\nJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\n1990's, most notably the careful study of the very nearby Sc\ngalaxy NGC4244, which found a highly flattened halo with by\nq = 0.2+0.3\n\u22120.1 out to radii of \u2248 2R25 (Olling, 1996). All applications\nof the flaring method have indicated highly flattened halo distributions with q \u2264 0.5 (Becquaert, 1997; Becquaert & Combes,\n1997; Sicking, 1997). Recently, Banerjee & Jog (2008) measured a flattening of q = 0.4 from flaring of the HI layer in M31.\nThis assumed a constant HI velocity dispersion with radius; if\nit is allowed to have a modest decline in the outer disk the flattening can be made less with q more like 0.5 to 0.6. With the\nexclusion of NGC4244, it may therefore be suspected that the\nassumption of a radially constant gas velocity dispersion has led\nto errors in the derived flattening of the halo.\nMeasurements of significant flattening using the flaring\nmethod initially led to the supposition that perhaps the method\nis systematically biased to flattened halos. Our analysis of\nUGC7321 shows that this is not the case: the gas layer flaring method is just as sensitive to prolate halos as it is to oblate\nones. Here, we briefly consider the set of q measurements using\nthe flaring method that have indicated flat halos. The flattening\nfor NGC891 (Becquaert & Combes, 1997) was estimated from\nVLA observations with a low peak signal-to-noise of 13 (Rupen,\n1991). The low sensitivity could have led to underestimates of\nthe gas density and vertical flaring, thus changing the shape of\nboth dKz,tot /dz and dKz,g /dz, and thereby q. Except in the case\nof NGC4244 (Olling, 1996), it is unclear what model was used\nfor the radial gas velocity dispersion. An assumption of radiallyconstant gas velocity dispersion could easily skew the derived\nhalo shape measurement.\nIn some cases it is not clear whether the gas self-gravity\nwas included in the mass modelling. Additionally, excluding\nNGC4244, all the previous measurements of the halo flattening\nfrom the gas layer flaring were performed on large Sb-Sc galaxies with maximum rotation speeds vmax between 177 and 295\nkm s\u22121 . As the gas layer flaring is inversely proportional to vmax ,\n< 1 kpc, making it\nthe maximum HI flaring of these galaxies is \u223c\ndifficult to resolve unless the galaxy is nearer than 5 Mpc.\nThe Galactic q measurement from the gas flaring by\nOlling & Merrifield (2000) is particularly interesting. They were\nunable to fit the halo with a pseudo-isothermal model, unless the\nSolar radius and rotation velocity are significantly less (R\u2299 \u2264 7.6\nkpc, \u0398\u2299 \u2264 190 km s\u22121 ) than the standard values. The uncertainty\nassociated with these values translates to a large uncertainty of\nq: q = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3.\nUGC7321 is the least massive galaxy for which the halo flattening has been measured. The derived R-band face-on central\nsurface brightness is 2.5 times fainter than the B-band measurement of NGC4244, and the total R-band luminosity is 4.5 times\nfainter than NGC4244, while its gas layer flares to twice the\nheight of NGC4244. The very low stellar mass of UGC7321\nmade it an ideal candidate for halo modelling with the gas flaring\nmethod.\nAlthough there are now a number of different measurements\nof galactic halo flattening, there is no obvious concentration\naround a particular halo shape or any correlation of halo flattening with galaxy morphology. Currently the measured q values\nrange from 0.1 to 1.4. The low q values for the large Sb galaxies, M31, NGC891 and NGC4013, are puzzling as in these cases\nthe stellar density distribution may be more spherical than the\nhalo density distribution. It seems unlikely that the galactic halos could exist in the range of shapes measured, unless the fractions of the constituent dark matter types vary significantly from\ngalaxy to galaxy. Early work by Dubinski (1994) found that including baryon infall in n-body halo simulations led to nearly\n\naxisymmetric halos. Most n-body simulations without hydrodynamics tend to form prolate halos (Sellwood, 2004); however,\nnew work by Dubinski (unpublished) has shown that the inclusion of hydrodynamical modelling generates halos that are more\nspherical.\nWe note here an application of HI hydrostatics to our Galaxy\nby Kalberla et al. (2007), which illustrates the potential power\nof HI hydrostatics to trace the Galactic potential gradient and\nhence the total dark matter distribution in the Galaxy. Kalberla\net al. adopted an isothermal velocity dispersion for the Galactic\nHI and found several components of dark matter, including the\nusual extended halo with a mass of about 1.8 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , a thick\nself-gravitating disk with a mass of about 2 to 3 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , and\nan outer dark matter ring with a mass of about 2 to 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 .\nSimilar studies in other edge-on galaxies may reveal comparable substructure in the dark matter, including dark matter rings\nwhich may be left over from accreted and circularized smaller\ngalaxies, drawn down into the disk by dynamical friction. As\nwe will argue in the next section, it is important to measure the\nstructure, rotation and velocity dispersion of the HI in both R\nand z, to ensure such structures are not artifacts of assumptions\nrequired to apply the hydrostatics.\nFinally we note that since we submitted the original version\nof this paper, a study of the density distribution of dark matter\nhalo of UGC 7321 by Banerjee et al. (2010) appeared, using the\nrotation curve and flaring of the HI layer derived from the same\ndata. In this study the fitting was performed with the halo central\ndensity, core radius and radial exponential density slope as free\nparameters, but with the halo assumed spherical, the stellar M/L\nof the disk fixed and using values for the HI velocity dispersion\nfrom Gaussian fits to the position-velocity profiles (typically 7\nto 9 km s\u22121 ). These authors also conclude from their work that\nthe dark matter halo dominates the dynamics of UGC 7321 at\nall radii, but they do not put constraints on the dark matter halo\nflattening.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this study we have shown that it is possible to measure the gas\nflaring and HI velocity dispersion via modelling of the HI distribution. Using these methods we found that the small late-type\ndisk galaxies in our sample show substantial HI flaring, increasing linearly with radius in the inner disk and exponentially in\nthe outer disk. The HI velocity dispersion has a mean value of\n7 km s\u22121 , but varies from 4.5 to 12 km s\u22121 . Our HI modelling\nmethod is also capable of measuring the vertical variation of the\nHI velocity dispersion given additional HI observations.\nUGC7321, a small low surface brightness Sd galaxy in our\nsample, has the most accurate flaring measurements in our sample. We were unable to model the observations using a pseudoisothermal halo. By lowering the asymptotic halo rotation to a\nvalue corresponding to a true isothermal halo model, we found\nthat UGC7321 has a spherical halo density distribution of q =\n1.0 \u00b1 0.1. Highly prolate halos (q > 1.2) and highly flattened\nhalos (q < 0.6) are strongly excluded if our approximation of a\ntrue isothermal halo is valid.\nOur mass modelling analysis assumed that the HI gas velocity dispersion was vertically isothermal, as no measurements of\nthe vertical variation of the HI gas velocity dispersion are as yet\navailable.2 If the HI velocity dispersion is in fact vertically de2\n\nOur measurements of the HI gas velocity dispersion used the vertically averaged HI distribution, ie. they are the luminosity-weighted\nmean velocity dispersion as a function of radius.\n\n\fJ.C. O'Brien et al.: The dark matter halo shape of edge-on disk galaxies IV\n\nclining, this would lead to a larger estimated vertical gradient\nof the total vertical force, which may allow a pseudo-isothermal\nmodel for the halo.\nUGC7321 is a gas-rich galaxy (MHI /LR = 2.2), with a very\nlow stellar mass galaxy (M = 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ), four times less massive than the gas disk. The R-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of\n< 0.2. Mass modelling of the verUGC7321 is very low at M/LR \u223c\ntical force distribution showed that vertical force fitting provides\na much stronger constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio than\nthe standard method of radial force fitting via rotation curve decomposition.\nTwo important assumptions in this work need to be tested\nfurther. The first is that the HI velocity dispersion is isothermal\nin z. For a definitive estimate of the R and z-components of the\ntotal potential gradients from HI hydrostatics, it is essential to\nhave reliable measurements of the HI density, rotation and velocity dispersion as a function of both R and z. It should be possible,\nwith additional short spacing ATCA observations supplementing\nour data, to measure the HI velocity dispersion as a function of\nz in ESO274-G001 by modelling the HI XV diagram at varying\nheights above the galactic plane. ESO274-G001 is the closest,\nisolated, southern edge-on galaxy at a distance of 3.4 Mpc. In\nthe northern hemisphere, UGC7321 is a prime candidate due to\nits high HI mass, despite its larger distance of 10 Mpc. The large\nHI flaring means that the HI could be measured at a height of 400\npc for radii from 5-11 kpc, and at 700 pc for radii from 9-11 kpc.\nThe dwarf Scd galaxy NGC5023 is also an excellent candidate,\ngiven its distance of about 8 Mpc (van der Kruit & Searle, 1982).\nFor this galaxy, early flaring measurements by Bottema et al.\n(1986) found that the gas thickness was constant with radius.\nThis is a surprising result, because the vmax value for this galaxy\nis only about 80 km s\u22121 , and large flaring might be expected. It\nwould be interesting to measure the radial and vertical variation\nof the gas velocity dispersion, gas flaring, and halo shape using\nbeter data, as this galaxy has a similar size, HI brightness and\ntotal mass as UGC7321.\nThe other important test is to determine whether a true\nisothermal halo provides a better model than the pseudoisothermal halo for the dark matter in late-type disk galaxies,\nor whether there are better models than either of these. Our\nanalysis of UGC7321 has shown that the vertical gradient of\nthe vertical force provides a significantly stronger constraint on\nthe halo density distribution than does rotation curve decomposition. So, this test can in principle be achieved by analysing\nUGC7321 and the other galaxies in our sample with both flattened pseudo-isothermal and true isothermal halo models. Such\nflattened isothermal halos could be flattened by rotation or by\nanisotropy of the velocity dispersion. This will determine which\nkind of model is better for both the radial halo force as measured from the rotation curve, and the vertical force of the halo\ndetermined from dKz /dz fitting.\nAcknowledgements.
