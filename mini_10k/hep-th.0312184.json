Rigidly rotating strings in AdS [4] (as well\nas circular pulsating strings [5]) were considered long time ago, but the direct\nconnection with gauge theory was only discovered quite recently [6]. Namely,\nit was noticed that the subleading term in the scaling relation between energy\nE and spin S, for the rigidly rotating strings, is logarithmic\nE \u2212 S \u223c ln(S)\n\n(1.1)\n\nsimilarly to results found for certain Yang-Mills operators back in the early\ndays of QCD [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The paper [6] initiated a whole industri of\nfinding new string solitons, and in some cases also the corresponding YangMills operators. See for instance [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,\n24, 25, 26] for various string configurations.\nMore recently it was discovered that multi spin solutions could also be\nconstructed easily [27]. Among others, a relatively simple solution was found\nin AdS5 describing a string which is located at a point in the radial direction, winding around an angular direction and spinning with equal angular\nmomentum in two independent planes. In the long string limit it was shown\nthat\nE \u2212 2S \u223c S 1/3\n(1.2)\ndiffering substantially from (1.1). This is not at all a problem though, since\nthe subleading terms are well-known to depend on the particular string configuration. Multi spin solitons have been further investigated in a number of\npapers including [26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] (for a review see [37]).\nIn particular, in [32] it was shown that the solutions to the string equations of\nmotion can be classified and related to solutions of the integrable Neumann\nsystem. However, multi spin solutions were mostly considered in S 5 in the\nabovementioned papers. Even though AdS5 and S 5 geometrically only differ\nby a couple of signs, the scaling relations between energy and spin for string\nsolitons are completely different. So, much more work needs to be done for\nmulti spin solutions in AdS5 .\nWhile many explicit multi spin solutions in S 5 have been constructed\n[27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37], it seems that there are essentially still only two\n3\n\n\fexplicit multi spin solutions known in AdS5 , namely the one-parameter family [27] leading to (1.2) and its generalisation to arbitrary unequal angular\nmomenta [34, 37], which gives a somewhat similar (although non-regular)\nscaling relation.\nIn the present paper we construct another one-parameter family of multi\nspin solutions in AdS5 . Our solutions describe 2N-folded strings in the radial\ndirection and also winding M times around an angular direction. They are\nspinning with equal angular momentum in two independent planes. For\nsome reason, for which we have no physical explanation, the closed string\nperiodicity conditions can only be fulfilled provided N/M > 2, i.e., the strings\nmust be folded at least six times in the radial coordinate. But it must be\nstressed that the strings are not folded in spacetime; they consist of 2N\nsegments.\nMoreover, our strings are quite different from the usual straight strings\nspinning in AdS [4], since they are not spinning around their center. Instead,\nthe whole string is spinning, or actually orbiting, around origo similarly to\nsolutions previously found in black hole spacetimes [4, 15, 38, 39]. There\nis of course no central attractive body in this case; instead, the orbits are\nstabilised by the string winding around an angular direction.\nFor long strings we find that\nE \u2212 2S \u223c ln(S)\n\n(1.3)\n\nsimilarly to (1.1) except for the obvious factor 2, but completely different\nfrom (1.2). Thus we recover the remarkable logaritmic scaling relation from\nthe one-spin case [6]. It must be stressed that our solutions are \"orthogonal\"\nto the solutions of [27] in the sense that there is only one common solution\nin the two families, and this particular solution is not a long string.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present our ansatz\nand solve the resulting equations of motion explicitly. We also obtain the\nperiodicity conditions in compact form. In Section 3, we solve the periodicity\nconditions for short and long strings, and analyse the corresponding string\nconfigurations. We also comment on the relation to previously known results.\nIn Section 4, we compute the energy E and the two spins S1 = S2 \u2261 S,\nand derive the logaritmic scaling relation (1.3) in the limit of long strings.\nFinally in Section 5, we present our conclusions as well as some comments\nabout stability.\n\n4\n\n\fTwo-Spin Solutions in AdS5\n\n2\n\nWe take the AdS5 line-element in the form\nds2 = \u2212(1 + H 2 r 2 )dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b2 2 + sin2 \u03b2d\u03c62 + cos2 \u03b2d\u03c6\u0303(2.1)\n)\n2\n2\n1+H r\n\nwhere H \u22121 is the scale of AdS5 . The 't Hooft coupling in this notation is\n\u03bb = (H 2 \u03b1\u2032 )\u22122 .\nThe string which is extended in the r and \u03b2 directions and spinning with\nequal spin in the \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0303 directions, is obtained by the ansatz\nt = c0 \u03c4,\n\nr = r(\u03c3),\n\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(\u03c3),\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c9\u03c4,\n\n\u03c6\u0303 = \u03c9\u03c4\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere c0 and \u03c9 are arbitrary constants. Then the r and \u03b2 equations become\n\nr \u2032\u2032 \u2212\n\nr\u20322 H 2r\n2\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 (1 + H 2r 2 )r \u2212H 2 c20 (1 + H 2 r 2 )r + \u03c9 2(1 + H 2 r 2 )r = 0 (2.3)\n1 + H 2r2\n\n2r \u2032 \u03b2 \u2032\n=0\nr\nwhile the non-trivial conformal gauge constraint is\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 +\n\nr\u20322\n2\n+ r 2 \u03b2 \u2032 \u2212 c20 (1 + H 2 r 2 ) + r 2 \u03c9 2 = 0\n2\n2\n1+H r\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe system is reduced to first order form\n\u03b2\u2032 =\n\nk\nr2\n\n(2.6)\n\nr\u20322\nk2\n+\n+ r 2 \u03c9 2 \u2212 c20 (1 + H 2 r 2 ) = 0\n(2.7)\n1 + H 2r2 r2\nwhere k is an integration constant. These equations are identical to those\nconsidered in [27] (in the parametrisation Hr = sinh \u03c1), but only constant r\nsolutions were found there. Similar equations and their generalisations were\nalso considered in [34, 37], but again only constant r solutions were explicitly\nconstructed. We shall now show that solutions with r = r(\u03c3) exist as well,\nprovided that the string is folded at least six times in the radial direction.\n5\n\n\fFirst concentrate on the r equation (2.7).

To get a real non-singular solution, we take a to\nbe half the imaginary period. Then the Weierstrass function reduces to a\nJacobi elliptic function [40].

It is quite similar to straight strings spinning around black holes\n[4, 15, 38, 39], but unlike one-spin strings in AdS which spin around their\ncenter [4].\nThe solution (2.23) must be supplemented with the closed string periodicity condition r(\u03c3 + 2\u03c0) = r(\u03c3). For a 2N-folded closed string (N positive\ninteger), this condition becomes\n\u221a\n1\nmK(m)\n\u221a\n=\n(2.25)\nN\n\u03c0 b\nwhich trivially gives b in terms of m. This condition of course drops out\nfor n = 0 (which implies b = m = 0), corresponding to strings which are\npointlike in the radial direction [27]. Here we shall only consider strings\nwhich are extended in the radial direction.\nNow return to the \u03b2 equation (2.6). It is trivially integrated to\nr\nZ\ndx\nb(n \u2212 m)(1 \u2212 n) \u03c3\n\u03b2(\u03c3) =\n\u0010q\n\u0011\nnm\nb\n0 1 \u2212 nsn2\nx|m\nm\n!\nr\nr\n(n \u2212 m)(1 \u2212 n)\nb\n=\n\u03a0 n;\n\u03c3|m\n(2.26)\nn\nm\nSince \u03b2 is an angular coordinate, we impose the quasi-periodicity condition\n\u03b2(\u03c3 + 2\u03c0) = 2M\u03c0 + \u03b2(\u03c3), where M is another positive integer which plays\nthe role of a winding number. This condition translates into\np\n(1 \u2212 n)(n \u2212 m)\u03a0(n; m)\nM\n\u221a\n(2.27)\n=\n\u03c0 n\nN\nwhere (2.25) was also used. This equation determines n in terms of m, thus\nthe only free parameter (for fixed N, M) now is m.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis of the Solutions\n\nThe main problem when analysing the solutions of the previous section, is\nthat (2.27) is trancendental. Numerical analysis shows that the left hand\nside is less than 1/2 (it equals 1/2 only for m = 0, corresponding to strings\n8\n\n\fwhich are pointlike at r = 0). Thus, to get non-trivial solutions, we need\nN > 2M which means that the string must be folded at least six times. In\nthat case we get a one-parameter family of solutions with arbitrary extension\nin the radial direction.\nFor short and long strings, we can solve (2.27) analytically and confirm the\nnumerical results. First consider short strings. From (2.23) follows that short\nstrings correspond to m \u2248 0, n \u2248 0 (with m \u2264 n). Using that \u03a0(n; m) \u2248 \u03c0/2\nin this case, we get from (2.27)\n\u221a\nn\u2212m\nM\n\u221a\n\u2248\n(3.1)\n2 n\nN\nsuch that\n\nN2\nn\n\u2248 2\n, short strings\n(3.2)\nm\nN \u2212 4M 2\nwhich implies N > 2M. For such short strings, in the limit where r is almost\na constant, we get\nr\nN 2 \u2212 4M 2\n(3.3)\nHr \u2248\n4M 2\n\u03b2 \u2248 M\u03c3\n\n(3.4)\n\nthus the string is located at a fixed finite value of r and simply winding around\nin the \u03b2 direction. This is a special case of the solutions found in [27]. To\nget all the solutions of [27], one should discard the periodicity condition, as\ndiscussed after (2.25). But notice that our notion of short means short in the\nradial extension, which is different from the notion of short used elsewhere.\nNow consider long strings, which correspond to n \u2248 1, m \u2248 1 (with\nm \u2264 n). Here we use the approximation\ns\n!\nr\n\u03c0\n1\n1\n\u2212\nn\n2\n\u03a0(n; m) \u2248\n1 \u2212 sin\u22121\n(3.5)\n2 (1 \u2212 n)(n \u2212 m)\n\u03c0\n1\u2212m\nThen (2.27) gives\nM\n1 1\n\u2248 \u2212 sin\u22121\nN\n2 \u03c0\nsuch that\n\nr\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212n\nM\n\u2248 cos\n\u03c0 ,\n1\u2212m\nN\n9\n\nr\n\n1\u2212n\n1\u2212m\nlong strings\n\n(3.6)\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fwhich again implies N > 2M. This leads to the following expression for\nHrmin\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\nHrmin \u2248 cotan\n\u03c0\n(3.8)\nN\nThus the long strings extend outwards from this fixed value. We observe\nthat the long strings come closer to origo than the short strings.\n\n4\n\nEnergy and Spin\n\nThe conserved energy is given by\nZ 2\u03c0\nc0\nE=\n(1 + H 2r 2 (\u03c3))d\u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 0\n\n(4.1)\n\nIn our parametrisation, this can be expressed in terms of a complete elliptic\nintegral as follows\np\nN (2 \u2212 n)nm\nE(m)\n(4.2)\nE =\n\u03c0H\u03b1\u2032(n \u2212 m)\nSimilarly, the conserved spins are\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03c9\nr 2 (\u03c3) cos2 \u03b2(\u03c3)d\u03c3,\nS1 =\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 0\n\n\u03c9\nS2 =\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nr 2 (\u03c3) sin2 \u03b2(\u03c3)d\u03c3 (4.3)\n\n0\n\nsuch that [32]\nE\nS1 S2\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n= 2 \u2032\n2\nH c0\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nH \u03b1\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn our case, S1 = S2 \u2261 S = (S1 + S2 )/2, which in terms of complete elliptic\nintegrals gives\n\u221a\nN n + m \u2212 nm\n\u221a ((m \u2212 n)K(m) + nE(m))\nS =\n(4.5)\n2\u03c0H 2\u03b1\u2032 (n \u2212 m) n\nFurther simplifications are obtained for short and long strings, respectively.\nFor short strings, using (3.2), we arrive at the following finite expressions for\n10\n\n\fthe energy and spin\n\u221a\nN 2 N 2 \u2212 4M 2\n\u221a\nE \u2248\n4 2H\u03b1\u2032 M 2\n\u221a\n(N 2 \u2212 4M 2 ) N 2 \u2212 2M 2\n\u221a\nS \u2248\n8 2\u03b1\u2032 H 2 M 2\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nBut recall that these are just the minimal values within our family of strings.\nAs explained after (3.4), these strings are not short in the usual sense. In\nfact, we dont have solutions with E \u2248 0 and S \u2248 0 within our family of\nstrings.\nFor the long strings we can eliminate n using eq.(3.7) and get\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\n1\u2212m\n16\n\u0001\nE \u2248\n1+\n(4.8)\nlog\n4\n1\u2212m\n\u03c0 (1 \u2212 m)\n\u03c0H\u03b1\u2032 sin2 M\nN\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\nM\n16\n1\u2212m\nN\n2\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 2 sin\n(4.9)\n\u03c0 \u22121\nlog\nS \u2248\nN\n4\n1\n\u2212\nm\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 H 2 sin2 M\n\u03c0\n(1\n\u2212\nm)\nN\n\nwhich leads to\n\nN\nlog(2\u03c0H 2 \u03b1\u2032 S)\n(4.10)\n2\u03c0H 2 \u03b1\u2032\nup to an unimportant additive constant.\nThus, we recover the remarkable and celebrated logaritmic scaling relation\nknown from the one-spin case [6]. This should be contrasted with the twospin solutions considered in [27], where it was found that (in our notation)\nE/H \u2212 2S \u2248\n\nE/H \u2212 2S \u2248\n\n5\n\n3(H 2\u03b1\u2032 S)1/3\n24/3 H 2 \u03b1\u2032\n\n(4.11)\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, we have constructed a new one-parameter family of multi spin\nstring solitons in AdS5 . Contrary to the well-known one-spin solutions in\nAdS [4], our solutions are orbiting around origo. More importantly, contrary\nto other explicitly known multi spin solutions [27, 34], our solutions give the\nlogaritmic scaling relation between energy and total spin E \u2212 2S \u223c ln(S).\nThis suggests that the corresponding Yang-Mills operator can be constructed\nalong the lines of [6].\n11\n\n\fOur solutions can be generalised straightforwardly in various ways to\nsolutions in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . Either by adding one or more R-charges [27] or by\nadding pulsation [26].\nIn order to test the stability of our solutions, it would be interesting\nto consider lineralised perturbations around them. Unfortunately, it turns\nout to be extremely complicated because of the highly non-trivial sigmadependent r(\u03c3) and \u03b2(\u03c3). As a result, we will get sigma-dependent coefficients in the 3 coupled equations for the physical perturbations, which should\nbe compared with the case considered in [27] where the coefficients were constant. At the moment, we have no solution to this problem. However, we\ncan test our solutions in the limit where they reduce to a solution of [27].\nNamely our short strings (which are not short in the sense of [27]), where the\nspin is given p\nby (4.7). If we take\n\u221a the simplest allowed case (N = 3, M = 1),\nwe get S = 5 7\u03bb/2/8 \u2248 1.17 \u03bb, which is far below the set-in of instability\nfound in [27], thus ensuring us of a stable solution.\nAcknowledgements:\nWe would like to thank N.
