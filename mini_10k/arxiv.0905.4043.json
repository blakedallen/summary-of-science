The regularized phase space is infinitedimensional, because not all histories are determined by initial conditions. Gauge symmetries are not fully preserved by the regularization,\nand gauge anomalies arise. These anomalies are of a new type, not\npresent in QFT. They generically diverge when the regulator is removed, but can be made finite with a particular choice of field content,\nprovided that spacetime has at most four dimensions. The field content appears to include unphysical fields that violate the spin-statistics\ntheorem.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum Jet Theory (QJT) is an approach to quantization of field theories,\nin which not only the fields but also the observer's trajectory acquires quantum dynamics [4, 5, 6]. The main idea is to replace every quantum field by\na jet, which is essentially the same thing as a Taylor expansion around some\npoint q. A Taylor series is observer dependent in the sense that it depends\non the choice of expansion point, which can be identified with the observer's\nposition.\nThere are good reasons to expect that QJT becomes important in the\nquantization of gravity. Namely, QJT is a deformation of QFT, where the\ndeformation parameters are the observer's mass M and charge e. QFT\nis recovered in the limit M \u2192 \u221e (so the observer's position and velocity\n1\n\n\fcommute) and e \u2192 0 (so the observer does not disturb the fields). This\nlimit is readily taken for all interactions except gravity, where e = M . The\nphysical problem with a QFT of gravity is thus that we tacitly assume both\nthat the observer's inert mass is infinite and that his heavy mass is zero.\nHistorically, QJT grew out of the projective representation theory of\ngauge and diffeomorphism algebras, i.e. the multi-dimensional analogues of\naffine and Virasoro algebras [3, 9]. Jets become essential because it is impossible to construct lowest-energy representations of these algebras starting\nfrom the fields themselves; one must pass to trajectories in the space of pjets before quantization. The fact that QJT leads to new anomalies proves\nthat it is substantially different from QFT, which is positive since QFT is\nincompatible with gravity.\nWith this history in mind, it is not surprising that the most striking\nfeature of QJT is the appearence of new gauge and diff anomalies, which can\nnot be formulated within QFT. These anomalies were discussed in [7], but\nthat paper was unfortunately unusually opaque, even for this author. The\npurpose of the present paper is to clarify the origin of these new anomalies.\nIn quantum theory, a symmetry may become anomalous if there is no\nregularization which respects the symmetry, and the new QJT anomalies are\nno exception. QJT suggests a natural regularization procedure; replace \u221ejets by p-jets, p finite, i.e. truncate the Taylor expansions at order p. The\nalgebra of gauge transformations acts in a well-defined manner on p-jets,\nbecause it can only lower the order of Taylor coefficients. However, the p-jet\nregularization is still breaks the symmetry, because the equations of motions\ncan only be implemented in the \"body\" and not in the \"skin\". Although a pjet itself only has finitely many components, the p-jet phase space becomes\ninfinite-dimensional, because some histories are not determined in terms\nof initial conditions. The new anomalies arise in this infinite-dimensional\n\"skin\" of the p-jet phase space.\nAccording to popular belief, a gauge anomaly is automatically a sign of\ninconsistency. However, this is not correct. E.g., the no-ghost theorem in\nstring theory asserts that the free string can be quantized without ghosts in\nd 6 26 dimensions [1]. In other words, also the subcritical free string defines\na consistent quantum theory, despite its conformal anomaly. In general,\na gauge anomaly turns a classical gauge symmetry into a quantum global\nsymmetry, which acts on the Hilbert space instead of reducing it. This\nmay or may not be consistent, depending on whether the unreduced Hilbert\nspace admits a positive-definite metric preserved by the anomalous gauge\nsymmetry.\nWhereas a finite gauge anomaly may (or may not) be consistent, it seems\n2\n\n\fobvious that an infinite gauge anomaly renders the theory nonsensical. The\nanomalies in the p-jet regularization depend on p, and diverge in the field\ntheory limit p \u2192 \u221e if the number of spatial dimensions d > 2. However,\nit was observed in [4, 5] that the divergent part could be made to cancel,\nprovided that d 6 3. In this sense, QJT correctly postdicts that spacetime\nhas 3 + 1 dimensions. However, the cancellations lead to further conditions\non the field content, which seem difficult to reconcile with physics. In the\npresent paper we concentrate on gauge anomalies in theories of Yang-Mills\ntype, and we find below that, in addition to the gauge field and matter\nfermions, one must add a field which violates the spin-statistics theorem:\na fermion with a second-order equation of motion. It is unclear how this\nresult should be interpreted. However, it still represents progress compared\nto [5], where not even unphysical solutions to the consistency conditions\nwere known.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFree scalar field\nFields\n\nThe basic idea behind QJT is best described with a simple example: a\nfree scalar field \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(x, t) in (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime. As usual,\nspacetime indices are denoted by Greek letters \u03bc, \u03bd, and spatial indices by\nLatin letters i, j: x = (x\u03bc ) \u2208 Rd+1 has the spacetime decomposition x =\n(x, x0 ), where x = (xi ); in this section, t = x0 denotes the time coordinate.\nThe action reads\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n(1)\ndd+1x (\u22020 \u03c6)2 \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c62 .\nS=\n2\n\nThe mass is denoted by \u03c9 to avoid confusion with multi-indices introduced\nbelow. The equations of motion are of the form E(x, t) = 0, where\nE =\u2212\n\n\u03b4S\n= \u220202 \u03c6 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c6 + \u03c9 2 \u03c6.\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nThe phase space may be identified with the space of solutions of the equations of motion [2]. Since the equations (2) are second order, the solutions\ndepends on \u03c6(x, 0) and \u22020 \u03c6(x, 0) = \u03c0(x). Alternatively, we can coordinatize\nphase space by the Fourier modes ak and a\u2020k , because a general solution is\nof the form\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c6(x, t) = dd+1k ak ei(k0 t+k*x) + a\u2020k ei(\u2212k0 t+k*x) ,\n(3)\n3\n\n\fwhere k0 = \u03c9k \u2261\nis obviously\n\n\u221a\n\nk2 + \u03c9 2 . The relation between the two phase space bases\n\n\u03c6(x, 0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u22020 \u03c6(x, 0) = i\n\n2.2\n\nZ\n\ndd+1k (ak + a\u2020k )eik*x ,\n(4)\nd+1\n\nk k0 (ak \u2212\n\nd\n\na\u2020k )eik*x .\n\nInfinite jets\n\nNext we reformulate dynamics of the free scalar field in jet space. By definition, a p-jet is an equivalence class of functions; two functions belong to\nthe same class if their derivatives up to order p, evaluated at some given\npoint q, are the same. Locally, a p-jet has a unique representative which is\na polynomial of order at most p, namely the truncated Taylor series around\nthe point q. We may and will therefore identify p-jets with Taylor expansions truncated at order p; an infinite jet is hence a Taylor series where the\nsum continues to infinite order.\nThe field \u03c6(x, t) corresponds to the \u221e-jet with components\n{\u03c6,m (t), q i (t)} via the Taylor expansion\nX 1\n\u03c6,m (t) (x \u2212 q(t))m .\n(5)\n\u03c6(x, t) =\nm!\nm\nWe employ standard multi-index notation:\nm = (m1 , m2 , ..., md ),\n\nall mi > 0,\n\n(6)\n\nPd\n\nis a multi-index with length |m| =\nj=1 mj .

A solution is fully specified\nby the Cauchy data \u03c6,m (0) and \u03c6\u0307,m (0). Since phase space can be identified\nwith the space of solutions, a basis for phase space is given by \u03c6,m (0) and\n\u03c0,m (0) = \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (0). The phase space is infinite-dimensional, because the\nmulti-index m \u2208 Nd can take infinitely many values. This is expected,\nbecause an infinite jet contains essentially the same information as the field\nitself, modulo assumptions about convergence of the Taylor series (5). To\nfind the relation to the Fourier basis in (3), we expand the exponential as\neik*x = eik*q\n\nX 1\n(ik)m (x \u2212 q)m .\nm!\nm\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fWe find\nZ\n\ndd+1k (ak + a\u2020k )eik*q (ik)m ,\nZ\n\u03c0,m (0) = \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (0) = dd+1k ik0 (ak \u2212 a\u2020k )eik*q (ik)m .\n\n\u03c6,m (0) =\n\n(15)\n\nTo make sense of the divergent integrals over k involves subtleties which are\nignored.\n\n2.3\n\nFinite p-jets\n\nQJT has a natural built-in regularization method: truncate from infinite\njets to p-jets, p finite. This means that the Taylor series (5) is truncated at\norder p, i.e.\n\u03c6(x, t) \u2248\n\nX\n\n|m|6p\n\n1\n\u03c6,m (t) (x \u2212 q(t))m .\nm!\n\n(16)\n\nA basis for the space of all histories in p-jet space consists of q i (t) and\n\u03c6,m (t) for all m such that |m| 6 p. This suggests that the phase space, i.e.\nthe space of histories which solve the equations of motion, should be spanned\nby \u03c6,m (0) and \u03c0,m (0) = \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (0) with |m| 6 p. Hence the regulated phase\nspace\u0001should be finite-dimensional, and in fact the dimension should equal\n2 d+p\nd .\nHowever, except for case d = 0, i.e. ordinary quantum mechanics, this\nexpectation is wrong. When d = 0, we have the phase space of the harmonic\noscillator, which indeed is two-dimensional and spanned e.g. by the vectors\n\u03c6(0) and \u03c0(0). To see what goes wrong in higher dimensions, we return\nto the Taylor expansion of the equations of motion. The second term in\n(12) involves the term \u03c6,m+2\uf6be\u0302 , which is only defined for |m| 6 p \u2212 2 since\n\u03c6,m is only defined for |m| 6 p. Therefore, the equations of motion for\n\u03c6,m with |m| = p \u2212 1 or p are undefined. The situation is the same for\nthe time derivative \u03c6,m+20\u0302 , which according to (13) also depends on spatial\nderivatives of order |m| + 2.\nThe correct equations of motion read\n(\nP\n\u03c6,m+20\u0302 \u2212 dj=1 \u03c6,m+2\uf6be\u0302 + \u03c9 2 \u03c6,m , |m| 6 p \u2212 2\n(17)\nE,m =\nundefined\n|m| = p \u2212 1, p\nOne may imagine introducing some dynamics for the top modes, e.g. E,m \u2261 0\nfor |m| = p \u2212 1, p. However, such an assumption would be incorrect, as it\n6\n\n\fwould invalidate the solutions (3). The correct treatment is to leave the\ndynamics undefined for the top modes. This means that the equations of\nmotion do not fully specify the histories \u03c6,m (t) in terms of data living at\nt = 0.\nThe full p-jet phase space, i.e. the space of p-jet histories which solve\nthe equations of motion (17), is spanned by the basis\n\u03c6,m (0), \u03c0,m (0) = \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (0),\n\u03c6,m (t),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R,\n\n|m| 6 p \u2212 2,\n\n|m| = p \u2212 1, p.\n\n(18)\n\nThe p-jet phase space is infinite-dimensional because the equations of motion\nare unable to determine some histories in terms of data living at t = 0.\nTo facilitate further discussion, we define1\n\u2022 The body of a p-jet consists of the components \u03c6,m such that the\ncorresponding component E,m is defined.\n\u2022 The skin of a p-jet is the complement of the body, i.e. the components\n\u03c6,m such that E,m is undefined.\n\u2022 The thickness of the skin is n, if the body consists of \u03c6,m with |m| 6\np \u2212 n. For theories without gauge symmetries, the thickness is equal\nto the order of the equations of motion.\n\u2022 The terms body and skin are used about the p-jet phase space as well,\nto denote the subspace spanned by the body and skin of the p-jet.\nIn particular for the scalar field, a p-jet component \u03c6,m belongs to the body\nif |m| 6 p \u2212 2, it belongs to the skin if |m| = p \u2212 1 or p, and the thickness\nof the skin equals two.\nWe can now rephrase the main observation of this subsection: the body\nof the p-jet phase space is finite-dimensional, as expected by truncation\nfrom the \u221e-jet phase space, but the skin is infinite-dimensional, because\nthe equations of motion do not fix the skin of a p-jet in terms of initial data.\nThe infinite-dimensional skin turns out to be the source of anomalies.\n1\nThe concepts are called body and skin rather than the perhaps more natural terms\nbulk and shell, because the latter have other meanings as well, whereas the former appear\nto be unused.\n\n7\n\n\f2.4\n\nBV-BRST\n\nThe BV (Batalin-Vilkovisky) method [2] gives a cohomological construction\nof the phase space from arbitrary histories. It underlies the Manifestly\nCovariant Canonical Quantization (MCCQ) programme in [4, 5]. Although\nnot without problems, it clarifies some aspects of the p-jet phase space; in\nparticular, it clearly exhibits the separation between body and skin.\nReturn to the field formulation in subsection 2.1. In addition to the\nbosonic fields \u03c6(x, t), we introduce fermionic antifields \u03c6\u2217 (x, t). Define the\nBV-BRST operator \u03b4 by\n\u03b4\u03c6 = 0,\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2217 = E = \u2737\u03c6 + \u03c9 2 \u03c6.\n\n(19)\n\nThe cohomology groups are\nH 0 (\u03b4) = C(\u03c6)/N\nH i (\u03b4) = 0,\n\nif k > 0,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere C(\u03c6) is the space of smooth functionals over \u03c6, and N is the ideal\ngenerated by E. The BV complex thus yields a resolution of the space\nof functionals over phase space, which consists of histories that solve the\nequations of motion E = 0 [2].\nIn MCCQ, we introduce the canonical momenta in the history phase\nspace, satisfying the canonical commutation relations (CCR)\n[\u03c6(x, t), \u03c0(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )] = i\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ),\n{\u03c6\u2217 (x, t), \u03c0 \u2217 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 )} = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(21)\n\nNote that the CCR in history space are instantaneous; the RHS is proportional to \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). We can now rewrite the BV-BRST operator as a bracket;\nfor any functional F (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ), \u03b4F = [Q, F ], where\nZ\nQ = ddxdt E(x, t)\u03c0 \u2217 (x, t).\n(22)\nThe main problem with MCCQ is overcounting; the canonical momentum\n\u03c0 is not related to \u22020 \u03c6. We can overcome this problem by making the identification \u03c0 = \u22020 \u03c6, which amounts to adding further terms to \u03b4. However,\nthese terms necessarily break the manifest covariance which was a main\nmotivation.\n8\n\n\fIn the space of p-jet histories, the BV-BRST operators becomes\n|m| 6 p,\n\n\u03b4\u03c6,m = 0,\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2217,m = E,m ,\n\n|m| 6 p \u2212 2.\n\n(23)\n\nSince E,m is only defined for the body of the p-jet, so is the antifield \u03c6\u2217,m .\nIntroduce canonical momenta that obey the instantaneous CCR\nn\n[\u03c6,m (t), \u03c0 ,n (t\u2032 )] = i\u03b4m\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ),\nn\n{\u03c6\u2217,m (t), \u03c0\u2217,n (t\u2032 )} = \u03b4m\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(24)\n\nThe BV-BRST operator can now be written as a bracket \u03b4F = [Q, F ], where\nX Z\nQ=\ndt E,m (t)\u03c0\u2217,m (t).\n(25)\n|m|6p\u22122\n\nThere are two things to note:\n\u2022 The sum only runs over m in the body, because the antifield \u03c6\u2217,m and\nits canonical momentum \u03c0\u2217,n are only defined there.\n\u2022 Q is already normal ordered, because E,m is independent of the antifield. This will no longer be true in the presence of gauge symmetries.\nA jet does not only consist of the Taylor coefficients \u03c6,m , but also of the\nexpansion point q, which can be thought of as the observer's position. To\nfully specify jet dynamics, we must thus introduce some equations of motion\nfor this quantity as well. For simplicity, we equip q i (t) with the dynamics\nof a free relativistic point particle with mass M , described by the action\nZ\np\nS = \u2212M dt 1 \u2212 q\u03072 .\n(26)\nThis leads to the equations of motion\nEqi =\n\n\u0011\nd\u0010\nq\u0307 i\np\n= 0.\ndt\n1 \u2212 q\u03072\n\n(27)\n\nTo implement this in cohomology, we introduce antifields q\u2217i (t) and posit\nthat the BV-BRST operator acts as\n\u03b4q i = 0,\n\u03b4q\u2217i = Eqi .\n9\n\n(28)\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nReparametrizations\nFields\n\nThe Taylor expansion (5) is obtained from the spacetime jet\nX 1\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u03c6,m (x \u2212 q)m\nm!\nm\nXX 1\n\u03c6,(m0 ,m) (x0 \u2212 q 0 )m0 (x \u2212 q)m ,\n=\nm\n!m!\n0\nm m\n\n(29)\n\n0\n\nby setting x0 = q 0 = t, cf (8). In this section we relax this condition,\nand only assume that there is some function q 0 (t) such that x0 = q 0 (t),\nwhereas q 0 (t) 6= t in general. This function is not completely arbitrary, but\nis assumed to be everywhere smooth and invertible. Since the condition\nx0 = q 0 still holds, the m0 dependence in the Taylor series disappears.\nWe now have two types of time-like coordinates: the physical time x0 ,\nwhich appears directly in the equations of motion, and the time parameter\nt, which is not observable. They are related by\nx0 = q 0 (t),\n\nt = \u03c4 (x0 ).\n\n(30)\n\nConsequently, there are two types of time derivatives:\n\u2202t \u03c6 = q\u0307 0 \u22020 \u03c6,\n\n\u22020 \u03c6 = \u22020 \u03c4 \u2202t \u03c6.\n\n(31)\n\nBecause the functions q 0 (t) and \u03c4 (x0 ) are each other's inverses, q\u0307 0 \u22020 \u03c4 = 1.\nThe time parameter t is a non-observable gauge variable. The theory\nis invariant under infinitesimal reparametrizations t 7\u2192 t + f (t). The field\ntransforms as\n\u03c6(x, t) 7\u2192 \u03c6(x, t \u2212 f (t))\n\n\u03c6(x, t) \u2212 f (t)\u2202t \u03c6(x, t)\n\n=\n\n\u2261\n\n(32)\n\n\u03c6(x, t) + Lf \u03c6(x, t).\n\nFor simplicity we will only consider reparameterizations which leave the\nsurface t = 0 invariant. Hence we demand that\nf (0) = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nThis is not an essential restriction, but makes preservation of the phase space\nspanned by (4) manifest. The gauge generators Lf satisfy the Witt algebra\n[Lf , Lg ] = L[f,g] ,\n\n[f, g] = f \u0121 \u2212 g f \u0307.\n10\n\n(34)\n\n\fReparametrizations act as\n[Lf , \u03c6] = \u2212f \u2202t\u03c6,\n\n[Lf , \u2202\u03bc \u03c6] = \u2212f \u2202t\u2202\u03bc \u03c6,\n\n(35)\n\n[Lf , E] = \u2212f \u2202tE.\n\nIn other words, the field \u03c6 and its derivatives w.r.t. physical coordinates\ntransform as fields with weight 0 under reparametrizations, which is necessary because otherwise the equations of motion would not transform homogeneously. The observer's trajectory and its time derivative transform\nas\n[Lf , q \u03bc ] = \u2212f q\u0307 \u03bc ,\n\n(36)\nd\n\u03bc\n[Lf , q\u0307 ] = \u2212f q\u0308 \u2212 f \u0307q\u0307 = \u2212 (f q\u0307 ).\ndt\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nHence q also has weight 0, whereas q\u0307 is a density with weight +1. The\nreparametrization algebra admits the off-shell realization\nZZ\nLf = i\ndtddx f (t)\u2202t \u03c6(x, t)\u03c0(x, t),\n(37)\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere \u03c0(x, t) = \u2212i\u03b4/\u03b4\u03c6(x, t) satisfies (21). The representation defined by\n(35) acts in a non-trivial way on general histories, but preserves the phase\nspace spanned by \u03c6(x, 0) and \u22020 \u03c6(x, 0), because we assumed that f (0) = 0.\nReparametrizations generate a gauge symmetry under which the physical\nphase space is invariant.\n\n3.2\n\np-jets\n\nIt follows from (35) that the reparametrization algebra acts in p-jet space\nas\n[Lf , \u03c6,m ] = \u2212f \u03c6\u0307,m ,\n\n[Lf , \u03c6,m+\u03bc\u0302 ] = \u2212f \u03c6\u0307,m+\u03bc\u0302,\n[Lf , \u03c6\u0307,m ] = \u2212f \u03c6\u0308,m \u2212 f \u0307\u03c6\u0307,m = \u2212\n\nd\n(f \u03c6\u0307,m ),\ndt\n\n(38)\n\n[Lf , E,m ] = \u2212f \u0116,m ,\ntogether with the relations written down in (36). Hence it admits the offshell realization\nZ\nX Z\n,m\nLf = i\ndt f (t)\u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 (t) + i dt f (t)q\u0307 \u03bc (t)p\u03bc (t),\n(39)\n|m|6p\n\n11\n\n\fwhere \u03c0 ,m (t) = \u2212i\u03b4/\u03b4\u03c6,m (t) and p\u03bc (t) = \u2212i\u03b4/\u03b4q \u03bc (t); they satisfy the instantaenuous CCR (24) and\n[q \u03bc (t), p\u03bd (t\u2032 )] = i\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(40)\n\nWe emphasize that (39) is an off-shell realization which is valid before\nthe equations of motion have been taken into account. Reparametrizations\nact trivially on the body of the p-jet phase space, for the same reason that\nthey act trivially on the field phase space: f (0) = 0. However, they do\nnot act trivially on the skin, which depends on histories \u03c6,m (t) for all t. In\nother words, the p-jet regularization does not preserve the reparametrization\ngauge invariance of the original field formulation.\nThe theory is quantized by introducing a Fock vacuum, which is annihilated by negative frequency modes. The body of the phase space must\nbe polarized in some way, but exactly how this is done is not important,\nbecause this part of the phase space is finite-dimensional. In contrast, the\nskin of the phase space is infinite-dimensional and the choice of polarization\nis essential. The correct choice is to demand that negative frequency modes\nannihilate the vacuum 0 . For simplicity, assume that the time parameter\nt \u2208 S 1 takes values on the circle. This assumption is of course unphysical,\nbecause it leads to the introduction of closed time-like curves, but has some\nadvantages. E.g., that we may expand any jet history in Fourier modes:\n\u03c6,m (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c6,m (\u03b2)ei\u03b2t ,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03b2=\u2212\u221e\n\nand analogously for the momenta \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (t). We now posit that the vacuum\nis annihilated by negative-frequency modes:\n\u03c6,m (\u2212\u03b2) 0 = \u03c6,m+0\u0302 (\u2212\u03b2) 0 = 0,\n\nfor all \u2212\u03b2 < 0.\n\n(42)\n\nThere is some choice how to treat the zero modes with \u03b2 = 0, but exactly\nhow this is done is not essential since they only span a finite-dimensional\nsubspace.\nThe reparametrization generators must be normal ordered to avoid infinite contributions after quantization. Hence we must e.g. replace in (39)\n,m\n,m\n\u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 ,m (t) 7\u2192 : \u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 ,m (t): = \u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0<\n(t) + \u03c0>\n(t)\u03c6\u0307,m (t),\n\n(43)\n\n,m\n,m\nwhere \u03c0<\nand \u03c0>\nonly runs over negative and positive Fourier modes,\nrespectively. Moreover, only the skin of the phase space contributes, because\n\n12\n\n\freparametrizations act trivially on the finite-dimensional body. The normalordered generators thus read\nZ\nX\nLf =\ni dt f (t) : \u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 ,m (t): .\n(44)\np\u221216|m|6p\n\nThe contribution from the Taylor coefficients comes only from the skin,\nwhich is the difference between the full p-jet and the body. We can therefore\nwrite\n(p)\n\n(p\u22122)\n\n= Lf \u2212 Lf\n\nLf\n\n,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere\n(r)\nLf\n\n=\n\nX\n\n|m|6r\n\ni\n\nZ\n\ndt f (t) : \u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 ,m (t): .\n\n(46)\n\nThere is also a contribution from the observer's trajectory q \u03bc (t) of the\nform\nZ\nLqf = i dt f (t) : q\u0307 \u03bc (t)p\u03bc (t): .\n(47)\nThe dynamics for q i (t), which follows from the action (26), reduces the\nindependent degrees of freedom to the finite-dimensional space spanned by\nq i (0) and q\u0307 i (0), on which reparameterizations act trivially. We discuss this\nissue further in subsection 3.4.\n\n3.3\n\nReparametrization anomalies\n\nAfter normal ordering, the Witt algebra (34) acquires an extension and is\nreplaced by the Virasoro algebra\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nc\n[Lf , Lg ] = L[f,g] +\ndt f \u0308(t)\u0121(t) \u2212 f \u0307(t)g(t) .\n(48)\n24\u03c0i\n\nAs is well known, the contribution from a single bosonic function of t to the\ncentral charge is c = 2. \u0001The number of different multi-indices with |m| 6 r\nin d dimensions is d+r\nd . In view of (45), the total central charge for the\nskin becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd+p\nd+p\u22122\ncTot = 2\n\u22122\n.\n(49)\nd\nd\nThere are a number of points to observe with this formula.\n13\n\n\f\u2022 The reparametrization gauge symmetry becomes anomalous. Classically, we could eliminate the time parameter t by setting t = x0 . Such\na gauge fixing is not allowed after quantization due to the nonzero\ncentral charge.\n\u2022 The anomaly originates from the infinite-dimensional skin. The body\nof the p-jet phase space is finite-dimensional and can not give rise to\nanomalies.\n\u2022 When d = 0, the central charge (49) vanishes: c = 0.\n\u2022 When d = 1, the central charge is independent of p: c = 4. The skin\nalways consists of two functions \u03c6,p\u22121 (t) and \u03c6,p (t).\n\u2022 When d > 2, the central charge diverges in the limit p \u2192 \u221e.\n\u2022 There is also an additional contribution from the observer's trajectory\nq \u03bc (t), which we deal with in the next subsection. However, this contribution does not diverge when p \u2192 \u221e and is therefore not our main\nconcern.\nThe crucial observation is that the central charge diverges when d > 2.\nWe regard this as a sign of inconsistency, which must be avoided if QJT is\nto make sense. The rest of this paper is devoted to finding ways to cancel\nthe infinite parts of anomalies.\n\n3.4\n\nBV-BRST\n\nThe main benefit of MCCQ is that it facilitates the counting necessary to\ncompute anomalies like the one in the previous subsection. When relaxing\nthe condition q 0 (t) = t, we turn q 0 into a dynamical variable, and the action\n(26) is replaced by\nZ\nq\n(50)\nSq = \u2212M dt q\u0307 \u03bc q\u0307\u03bc (t).\n\nSince we have introduced an extra degree of freedom to describe the same\nphysics, the equations of motion\nd \u0010 q\u0307 \u03bc \u0011\np\n=0\n(51)\nEq\u03bc =\ndt\nq\u0307 2\n\nare redundant:\n\nq\u0307\u03bc\n1 d \u0010 q\u0307\u03bc q\u0307 \u03bc \u0011\np Eq\u03bc =\n\u2261 0.\n2 dt q\u0307 2\nq\u0307 2\n14\n\n(52)\n\n\fThis can bepcast in a more familiar form by noting that the momentum\np\u03bc = M q\u0307\u03bc / q\u0307 2 satisfies p2 = M 2 , and hence dp2 /dt = 0.\nTo implement this in cohomology, we introduce fermionice antifields q\u2217i (t)\nfor the equations of motion Eq\u03bc , bosonic second-order antifields \u03b6(t) for the\nredundancy (52), and a fermionic ghost c(t) which identifies states related by\nreparametrizations. This gives us the extended phase space of p-jet histories,\nover which the BV-BRST complex is defined. The BV-BRST operator acts\nas\n\u03b4c = \u2212c \u010b,\n\n\u03b4\u03c6,m = \u2212c \u03c6\u0307,m ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2217,m = E,m \u2212 c \u03c6\u0307\u2217,m ,\n\n\u03b4q \u03bc = \u2212c q\u0307 \u03bc ,\nd\n\u03b4q\u2217\u03bc = Eq\u03bc \u2212 (c q\u2217\u03bc ),\ndt\nq\u0307\u03bc\nd\n\u03b4\u03b6 = p q\u2217\u03bc \u2212 (c \u03b6).\n2\ndt\nq\u0307\n\n(53)\n\nThe reparametrization algebra acts on the extended phase space. Each\nquantity in (53) transforms as a density with weights \u22121 (c), 0 (\u03c6,m ), 0\n(\u03c6\u2217,m ), 0 (q \u03bc ), +1 (q\u2217\u03bc ), and +1 (\u03b6), respectively. These weights are reflected\nin the terms proportional to c in (53).\nThe action of the BV-BRST operator can be written as a bracket in the\nsame way as in subsection 2.4. For each quantity in (53) (c, \u03c6,m , etc.), we\nintroduce the corresponding momentum in history space, which is defined\nby instantaneous CCR like (24) or (40). The BV-BRST charge Q is then\ndefined in analogy with (25); for each relation in (53), we add a term that\nis linear in momenta.\nHowever, there is a crucial difference compared to the situation in subsection 2.4: the BRST charge is not automatically normal ordered. E.g., to\nimplement the relation \u03b4\u03c6,m the BRST charge must contain the term\nX Z\nQ\u03c6 =\ndt c(t)\u03c6\u0307,m (t)\u03c0 ,m (t).\n(54)\n|m|6p\n\n\u0001\nAfter normal ordering of these d+p\nterms, Q\u03c6 is no longer nilpotent, and\nd\nreparametrization may fail to be a gauge symmetry on the quantum level.\nHowever, that Q2\u03c6 6= 0 does not necessarily imply that Q2 = 0; the contributions from different fields to the anomaly may cancel.\n15\n\n\fThe situation is summarized in the following table.\nField Weight Order Parity\nc\nc\n\u22121\n0\nF\n\u221226\n\u0001\n\u03c6,m\n0\np\nB\n2 d+p\nd\n\u0001\n\u03c6\u2217,m\n0\np\u22122\nF\n\u22122 d+p\u22122\nd\nq\u03bc\n0\n0\nB\n2(d + 1)\nq\u2217\u03bc\n1\n0\nF\n\u22122(d + 1)\n\u03b6\n1\n0\nB\n2\nThe columns contain the following information: the type of field, its weight\nunder reparametrizations, the maximal order for which is defined (only applies to the Taylor coefficients), the Grassmann parity (bosonic or fermionic),\nand the contribution to the central charge.

Instead, it may transform as a\ndensity of weight \u03bb. The transformation law (35) is then replaced by\n[Lf , \u03c6] = \u2212f \u2202t \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bbf \u0307\u03c6,\n\n(56)\n\nfrom which it follows that\n[Lf , \u2202\u03bc \u03c6] = \u2212f \u2202t \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bbf \u0307\u2202\u03bc \u03c6,\n[Lf , E] = \u2212f \u2202t E \u2212 \u03bbf \u0307E.\n\n(57)\n\nHowever, the weight can only be nonzero if the equations of motion E are\nhomogeneous in \u03c6, because otherwise E would not transform homogeneously.\nThe discussion in this paper has been phrased for the free scalar field, but\nthe linear equations of motion have not been used until this point, and the\nconstruction goes through also for interacting theories. However, we must\nnow restrict ourselves to non-interacting theories, because nonzero weight is\nonly possible if the equations of motion are homogeneous.\n16\n\n\fAlas, this is not a serious restriction, because we can introduce interactions in the presence of several types of fields. Consider e.g. a scalar field\nminimally coupled to an electromagnetic field A\u03bc . The action reads\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nS=\n(58)\ndd+1x ((\u2202\u03bc + eA\u03bc )\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c62 .\n2\nThe equations of motion\n\nE = (\u2202\u03bc + eA\u03bc )2 \u03c6 + \u03c9 2 \u03c6\n\n(59)\n\nare homogeneous in \u03c6 but not in A\u03bc . Thus we may consistently assume that\n\u03c6 transforms as a density with any weight \u03bb, whereas A\u03bc must have weight\n\u03bb = 0.\nAs is well known, the central charge of a single scalar density is\nc = 2(1 \u2212 6\u03bb + 6\u03bb2 ).\n\n(60)\n\nThe formula for the total central charge for the skin (49) is replaced by\n\u0010\u0012d + p\u0013 \u0012d + p \u2212 2\u0013\u0011\n2\ncTot = 2(1 \u2212 6\u03bb + 6\u03bb )\n.\n(61)\n\u2212\nd\nd\n\nA nonzero weight thus modifies the value of cTot , but when d > 2 it still\ndiverges when p \u2192 \u221e.\nIn the presence of additional fields, such as the gauge potential A\u03bc , there\nare additional contributions to the central charge.\n\n3.6\n\nFermions\n\nConsider a model with a free fermionic field.

A priori, jet\nquantization of free fields only makes sense in d 6 1 dimensions, due to\nthe appearence of infinite reparametrization anomalies. However, with a\nclever choice of field content, the leading divergencies can be made to cancel,\nleaving a finite anomaly also in d = 2 dimensions. In contrast, the anomaly\nis never convergent if d > 3; there are simply not enough terms in (69) to\narrange sufficient cancellation.\nNote that the condition c0 > 0 is a necessary (but presumably not sufficient) condition for unitarity. Equation (70) leads to a finite central charge\nalso if c0 < 0, but we also demand that the representation of the Virasoro\nalgebra (48) is unitary, something which is only possible if cTot > 0.\n\n3.8\n\nGreen's functions and anomalies\n\nIn this subsection we emphasize the relation between reparametrization\nanomalies and locality, in the sense of Green's functions depending on separation.\nConsider some scalar field \u03c6(x, x0 ). The behaviour of the correlation\nfunction\nG(x \u2212 y, x0 \u2212 y 0 ) = 0 \u03c6(x, x0 )\u03c6(y, y 0 ) 0\n\n(72)\n\nwhen the physical points x and y coalesce is governed by the anomalous\ndimensions h:\nG(x \u2212 y, x0 \u2212 y 0 ) \u2248\n\nA\n,\n((x0 \u2212 y 0 )2 \u2212 (x \u2212 y)2 )h\n19\n\n(73)\n\n\ffor some constant A. In particular,\nG(0, x0 \u2212 y 0 ) \u2248\n\nA\n.\n(x0 \u2212 y 0 )2h\n\n(74)\n\nThe physical time coordinates are related to gauge time parameters as in\n(30): x0 = q 0 (t), y 0 = q 0 (t\u2032 ). The correlation function expressed in terms of\nthe time parameter thus diverges when t \u2192 t\u2032 as\nG(0, t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2248\n\nB\n,\n(t \u2212 t\u2032 )2h\n\n(75)\n\nwhere B = A/(q\u0307 0 (t))2h . Since q 0 (t) relates physical time to parameter\ntime, it must be an everywhere smooth and invertible function, which means\nthat q\u0307 0 (t) 6= 0 for every t. Hence the divergence of the Green's function is\ngoverned by the same anomalous dimension h, independent of whether it is\nexpressed in terms of physical or gauge time.\nAs is well known in conformal field theory, correlators of the form (75) are\ncompatible with local diffeomorphism symmetry on the circle, but only if the\ncentral charge in the Virasoro algebra (48) is nonzero, and indeed positive.\nThis is because all unitary, quantum representations of the Virasoro algebra\nwith lowest L0 eigenvalue h > 0 have c > 0. Hence locality and unitarity\ntogether imply that the reparametrization symmetry be anomalous.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nGauge theory\nFree Maxwell field\n\nThe action reads\n1\nS=\n4\n\nZ\n\ndd+1x F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere the field strength\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc .\n\n(77)\n\nE\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc = \u2737A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bd ,\n\n(78)\n\nThe equations of motion,\n\nare redundant and do hence not completely fix the time evolution, due to\nthe identity\n\u2202 \u03bc E\u03bc \u2261 0.\n20\n\n(79)\n\n\fConsequently, the theory is invariant under the gauge symmetry A\u03bc 7\u2192\nA\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc X, for X(x) an arbitary function over spacetime.\nThe gauge transformations generate the algebra map(d+1, u(1)) of maps\nfrom (d+ 1)-dimensional spacetime\nR to the abelian Lie algebra u(1). In terms\nof the smeared generators JX = dd+1xX(x)J(x), the bracket reads\n[JX , JY ] = 0.\n\n(80)\n\nThe action on the fields is given by\n[JX , A\u03bc ] = \u2202\u03bc X,\n[JX , F\u03bc\u03bd ] = 0,\n\n(81)\n\n[JX , E\u03bc ] = 0.\nThere are several ways to treat a gauge symmetry. For our purposes the most\nconvenient choice is a BV-BRST formalism analogous to the one introduced\nin subsection 2.4. To this end, we introduce a fermionic antifield A\u2217\u03bc , a\nbosonic second-order antifield \u03b6, and a fermionic ghost c. The BV-BRST\noperator \u03b4 is defined by\n\u03b4c = 0,\n\u03b4A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc c,\n\u03b4A\u2217\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(82)\n\n\u03b4\u03b6 = \u2202 \u03bc A\u2217\u03bc .\nOne readily checks that \u03b42 = 0 and that zeroth cohomology group can\nbe identified with the space of gauge-invariant functionals of A\u03bc (x, 0) and\nF\u03bc0 (x, 0), i.e. gauge-invariant functionals of the magnetic and electric fields\nat time t = 0.\n\n4.2\n\nFree Maxwell p-jets\n\nAs in the scalar field case, we pass to p-jet space by expanding the Maxwell\nfield in a Taylor series:\nX 1\nA\u03bc,m (t) (x \u2212 q(t))m .\n(83)\nA\u03bc (x, t) \u2248\nm!\n|m|6p\n\nWe can immediately translate the field concepts above to their jet space\nanalogs. Field strength:\nF\u03bc\u03bd,m = A\u03bd,m+\u03bc\u0302 \u2212 A\u03bc,m+\u03bd\u0302 .\n21\n\n(84)\n\n\fEquations of motion:\nE\u03bc,m =\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03b7 \u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bd\u03bc,m+\u03c1\u0302\n\n\u03bd,\u03c1=0\nd\nX\n\n=\n\n(85)\n\u03b7 \u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u03bd,\u03c1=0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nA\u03bc,m+\u03bd\u0302+\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 A\u03bd,m+\u03bc\u0302+\u03c1\u0302 .\n\nRedundancy:\nd\nX\n\n\u03bc,\u03bd=0\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd E\u03bc,m+\u03bd\u0302 = 0.\n\n(86)\n\nGauge transformations:\nA\u03bc,m 7\u2192 A\u03bc,m + \u2202m+\u03bc\u0302 X(q),\n\n(87)\n\nwhere we use the notation\n\u2202m X(q) = \u22021 ..\u22021 \u22022 ..\u22022 ... \u2202d ..\u2202d X(q(t)).\n| {z } | {z }\n| {z }\nm1\n\nm2\n\n(88)\n\nmN\n\nThe equations of motion are of second order, but the redundancy condition (86) involves derivatives of one order higher. The thickness of the skin\nis thus three. The cleanest way to construct the p-jet phase space is to use\nthe BV-BRST formalism. We can immediately read off the action of the\nBRST operator \u03b4 on p-jets from (82):\n\u03b4c,m = 0,\n\u03b4A\u03bc,m = c,m+\u03bc\u0302 ,\n\u03b4A\u2217\u03bc,m =\n\nd\nX\n\n(89)\n\n\u03b7 \u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bd\u03bc,m+\u03c1\u0302 ,\n\n\u03bd,\u03c1=0\n\n\u03b4\u03b6,m =\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd A\u2217\u03bc,m+\u03bd\u0302 .\n\n\u03bc,\u03bd=0\n\nIn view of the second equation in (89), it might appear that we need to define\nthe ghost c,m for all |m| 6 p + 1. However, the p-jet BRST operator only\nneeds to implement the gauge symmetry in the body of the p-jet A\u03bc,m , which\nconsists of |m| 6 p \u2212 3 because the skin has thickness three. It therefore\n22\n\n\fsuffices to define c,m for |m| 6 p\u22122. The maximal order and the Grassmann\nparity of the various fields and antifields are listed in the following table:\nField Order Parity\nA\u03bc,m\np\nB\nA\u2217\u03bc,m p \u2212 2\nF\nc,m\np\u22122\nF\n\u03b6,m\np\u22123\nB\n\n(90)\n\nIn the parity column, B stands for bosonic and F for fermionic.\nThe algebra of gauge transformations acts on the p-jet A\u03bc,m as\n[JX , A\u03bc,m ] = \u2202m+\u03bc\u0302 X(q).\n\n(91)\n\nIt follows that JX commutes with the field strength F\u03bc\u03bd,m and with the\nequations of motion. Therefore, the action on the fields and anti-fields in\n(89) is given by\n[JX , A\u2217\u03bc,m ] = [JX , c,m ] = [JX , \u03b6,m ] = 0.\n\n(92)\n\nAn explicit off-shell realization of the gauge generators, acting in the space\nof arbitary p-jet histories, is\nJX =\n\nd Z\nX X\n\ndt i\u2202m+\u03bc\u0302 X(q(t))E \u03bc,m (t),\n\n(93)\n\n|m|6p \u03bc=0\n\nwhere E \u03bc,m = \u2212i\u03b4/\u03b4A\u03bc,m satisfies the instantaneous CCR\nn\n[A\u03bc,m (t), E \u03bd,n (t\u2032 )] = i\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4m\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(94)\n\nBecause the expression (93) is linear in E, normal ordering is not possible\nand the gauge algebra does not acquire any extension.\n\n4.3\n\nYang-Mills theory\n\nThe situation becomes more interesting if we consider a non-abelian gauge\ntheory. Let g denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with generators J a ,\ntotally anti-symmetric structure constants f abc , and Killing metric \u03b4ab . The\nLie brackets are given by\n[J a , J b ] = if abc J c .\n\n23\n\n(95)\n\n\fThe gauge transformations generate the algebra map(d + 1, g) of maps from\n(d + 1)-dimensional spacetime into g. For every g-valued function X =\nXa (x)J a , we define the smeared operator JX , with brackets\n[JX , JY ] = J[X,Y ] ,\n\n(96)\n\nwhere [X, Y ] = if abc Xa Yb J c . This algebra admits the \"central\" extension\n[8]\nZ\nk ab\n\u03b4\n[JX , JY ] = J[X,Y ] \u2212\nq\u0307 \u03bc (t)Xa (q(t))\u2202\u03bc Yb (q(t)),\n(97)\n2\u03c0i\nwhich is the natural generalization of the affine Kac-Moody algebra \u011d to\nmulti-dimensions. Since this extension is proportional to the second Casimir\ntr J a J b rather than to the third Casimir dabc = tr (J a J b + J b J a )J c , it does\nnot arise in QFT.\nThe construction of the phase space proceed in analogy with the abelian\ncase.

To this end, we introduce an antifield Aa\u03bc , a ghost ca , and a second-order\nantifield \u03b6 a . The BV-BRST operator \u03b4 acts in the extended phase space as\n\u03b4ca = if abc cb cc ,\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc = if abc Ab\u03bc cc + \u2202\u03bc ca ,\nc\n\u03b4A\u2217a\n= (D \u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc )a + if abc A\u2217b\n\u03bc\n\u03bcc ,\n\n\u03b4\u03b6 a = (D \u03bc A\u2217\u03bc )a + if abc \u03b6 b cc .\n24\n\n(102)\n\n\fThe zeroth cohomology group can be identified with the space of gaugeinvariant functionals over Aa\u03bc (x, 0) and \u22020 Aa\u03bc (x, 0), i.e. functionals over the\nphysical phase space.\nWe now proceed to p-jets. The algebra of gauge transformations (96)\nacts on the fields and antifields:\n[JX , Aa\u03bc,m ] = if abc (X b Ac\u03bc ),m + \u2202m+\u03bc\u0302 X a ,\nabc\n[JX , A\u2217a\n(X b A\u2217c\n\u03bc,m ] = if\n\u03bc ),m ,\n\n[JX , ca,m ] = if abc (X b cc ),m ,\n\n(103)\n\na\n[JX , \u03b6,m\n] = if abc (X b \u03b6 c ),m ,\n\nwhere (XA),m denotes the m:th coefficient in the Taylor expansion of\nX(x)A(x, t) around the point x = q(t), i.e.\nX \u0012m\u0013\n(XA),m =\n\u2202m\u2212n X(q(t))A,n (t).\n(104)\nn\n|n|6p\n\nFrom (103) we can read off an explicit expression for the gauge generators\nJX , in analogy with (93). However, in constrast to the abelian case, this\nexpression contains bilinear terms which must be normal ordered after quantization. This normal ordering gives rise to a Kac-Moody-like extension of\nthe form (97).\nIf a field transforms in the g representation \u033a, the \"abelian charge\" k in\n(97) is k = \u2212Q\u033a (if the field is bosonic) or k = +Q\u033a (if the field is fermionic),\nwhere the value of the second Casimir operator in \u033a is given by\ntr J a J b = Q\u033a \u03b4ab .\n\n(105)\n\nIn particular, the gauge potential and its antifields and ghost all transform\nin the adjoint representation of g, so \u033a = ad here. Moreover, Aa\u03bc and A\u2217a\n\u03bc\nare vector fields with d + 1 components. We can therefore write down a list\nanalogous to (90), with an extra column which denotes the contribution to\nthe abelian charge from each jet component.\nField Order Parity\nk\nAa\u03bc,m\np\nB\n\u2212(d + 1)Qad\nA\u2217\u03bc,m p \u2212 2\nF\n(d + 1)Qad\nc,m\np\u22122\nF\nQad\n\u03b6,m\np\u22123\nB\n\u2212Qad\n25\n\n(106)\n\n\fThe total extension is thus\nkTot\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd+p\nd+p\u22121\n= \u2212(d + 1)Qad\n+ (d + 1)Qad\nd\nd\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd+p\u22122\nd+p\u22123\n+ Qad\n\u2212 Qad\nd\nd\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd+p\u22121\nd+p\u22123\n= \u2212(d + 1)Qad\n+ Qad\n.\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\n\n(107)\n\nIn the non-abelian case, kTot vanishes if d = 0, it equals \u2212Qad independent of\np if d = 1, and it diverges with p if d > 2. In the abelian case, Qad = 0, and\nkTot = 0 in any numbers of dimensions, in agreement with our observation\nin the previous subsection.\n\n4.4\n\nMatter fields\n\nWe introduce fermions via the minimal coupling prescription. For simplicity,\nwe write down formulas for the Maxwell theory only, but it is straightforward\nto write down the required modifications in the non-abelian case. To the\nfree Maxwell action (76) we add the Dirac action\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nS\u03c8 = dd+1x \u03c8\u0304 i\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 eA\u03bc ) \u2212 \u03c9 \u03c8.\n(108)\n\nThe equations of motion become\n\nEA\u03bc = \u2202\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 j \u03bc = 0,\n\nE\u03c8 = i\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 eA\u03bc )\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c8 = 0,\n\n(109)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0112\u03c8 = i(\u2202\u03bc + eA\u03bc )\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 + \u03c9 \u03c8\u0304 = 0,\nwhere the current\nj \u03bc = ie\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8.\n\n(110)\n\nBecause of current conservation, \u2202\u03bc j \u03bc = 0, the equations of motion are\nredundant and do not completely fix the time evolution:\n\u2202 \u03bc E\u03bc \u2261 0.\n\n(111)\n\nAs a result, we still have an u(1) gauge symmetry (80), which acts on the\nfields as by\n[JX , A\u03bc ] = \u2202\u03bc X,\n[JX , \u03c8] = eX\u03c8,\n[JX , \u03c8\u0304] = \u2212eX\u03c8.\n26\n\n(112)\n\n\fIn p-jet space, the action on the fermions reads [JX , \u03c8,m ] = (X\u03c8),m , etc.\nBosonic matter can also be introduced, e.g. by adding a scalar electrodynamics term (58) to the action. For our purposes, the main difference\nbetween bosons and fermions resides in the sign of the extension (97). If\nwe assume that there are n\u03c6 bosonic species \u03c6 and n\u03c8 fermionic species \u03c8\n(where the conjugate \u03c8\u0304 counts as another species), the bosonic and fermionic\ncontributions to the abelian charge k become\nk\u03c6 = \u2212n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 ,\n\nk\u03c8 = +n\u03c8 Q\u03c8 ,\n\n(113)\n\nrespectively. We can readily generalize this to several different type of species\ntransforming in different representations \u033a; the abelian charge is simply the\nsum of the contributions from the different species, including sign.\nWe now turn to a general non-abelian gauge theory, with both fermionic\nand bosonic matter. After passage to p-jet space, the BV-BRST complex is\nbuilt from the following content:\nField Order Parity\nk\na\nA\u03bc,m\np\nB\n\u2212(d + 1)Qad\nA\u2217\u03bc,m p \u2212 2\nF\n(d + 1)Qad\nc,m\np\u22122\nF\nQad\n\u03b6,m\np\u22123\nB\n\u2212Qad\n\u03c8,m\np\nF\nn \u03c8 Q\u03c8\n\u2217\n\u03c8,m\np\u22121\nB\n\u2212n\u03c8 Q\u03c8\n\u03c6,m\np\nB\n\u2212n\u03c6 Q\u03c6\n\u2217\n\u03c6,m p \u2212 2\nF\nn \u03c6 Q\u03c6\n\n(114)\n\nThe columns list the type of field, the maximal order for which the corresponding jet is defined, its Grassmann parity (bose/fermi) and the contribution to the abelian charge in (97). Summing the various contributions,\nthe total abelian charge is\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nd+p\nd+p\u22121\nd+p\u22122\nd+p\u22123\nkTot = k0\n+ k1\n+ k2\n+ k3\n,\nd\nd\nd\nd\nwhere\nk0 = \u2212(d + 1)Qad + n\u03c8 Q\u03c8 \u2212 n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 ,\nk1 = \u2212n\u03c8 Q\u03c8 ,\n\n(115)\n\nk2 = (d + 1)Qad + Qad + n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 ,\nk3 = \u2212Qad .\n27\n\n\fIf we choose\nk1 = \u22123k0 ,\n\nk2 = 3k0 ,\n\nk3 = \u2212k0 ,\n\nrepeated use of the identity (67) leads to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd+p\u22123\nkTot = k0\n.\nd\u22123\n\n(116)\n\n(117)\n\nProvided that the conditions (116) are satisfied, the total abelian charge\nvanishes when d 6 2 and has a finite value if d = 3. We read off from (115)\nthat in order for this to happen, we must have\n\u2212 (d + 1)Qad + n\u03c8 Q\u03c8 \u2212 n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 = k0 ,\n\n\u2212n\u03c8 Q\u03c8 = \u22123k0 ,\n\n(d + 1)Qad + Qad + n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 = 3k0 ,\n\n(118)\n\n\u2212Qad = \u2212k0 .\nThese are four equations for three unknowns, and would in general not be\nsolvable. However, the equation system turns out to be singular, and admits\nthe solution\nk0 = Qad ,\nn\u03c8 Q\u03c8 = 3Qad ,\n\n(119)\n\nn\u03c6 Q\u03c6 = (1 \u2212 d)Qad = \u22122Qad ,\n\nif d = 3.\n\nIn order for the QJT of a non-abelian gauge theory to have a finite gange\nanomaly in 3 + 1 dimensions, these conditions on the matter content are\nnecessary.\nNo interesting solution to the conditions (119) has been found, and in\nfact there is a serious problem with the negative sign in the last equation;\nit implies a violation of the spin-statistics problem. Since \u03c6 is bosonic, the\nabelian charge k\u03c6 = \u2212n\u03c6 Q\u03c6 must be negative; however, the last equation\nabove implies that k\u03c6 is positive, so \u03c6 must in fact be fermionic. On the\nother hand, we assumed that the equations of motion for \u03c6 are second order,\nwhich implies that \u03c6 has integer spin. The only solution to (119) is thus\nthat \u03c6 is an integer spin fermion, which violates the spin-statistics theorem\nif \u03c6 is a physical field. We discuss this matter further in the conclusion.\n\n28\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we considered QJT as a regularization method: we replace\nall fields by p-jets, i.e. their Taylor expansions truncated at order p. Although the space of p-jets is finite-dimensional, the p-jet phase space is\ninfinite-dimensional, because only histories in the body are specified by initial conditions.\nThe p-jet regularization does not preserve the gauge symmetries of the\noriginal theory. The gauge symmetries become anomalous in the regularized\ntheory due to the infinite dimensionality of the skin, and this anomaly does\nnot vanish when the regularization is removed by taking the p \u2192 \u221e limit.\nWorse, the corresponding \"abelian charges\" diverge in more than 1 + 1\ndimensions, but with a clever choice of field content the anomalies can be\nrendered finite in 3 + 1 dimension; the critical number of spatial dimensions\nd = 3 equals the thickness of the skin.\nWe studied conditions for cancelling the divergent parts of Yang-Mills\nanomalous, but no solutions were found. In fact, the solution in (119) appears to violate the spin-statistics theorem; the field \u03c6 should be fermionic\nbut have second-order equations of motion, i.e. integer spin. It is conceivable\nthat one could interpret \u03c6 as the ghost for some additional symmetry, perhaps having something to do with confinement or gauge symmetry breaking.\nIf so, the apparent violation of the spin-statistics theorem is not a problem,\nbecause \u03c6 is not a physical field. This issue deserves further investigation.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.B. Green, J.H. Schwarz and E. Witten, Superstring theory, volume\nI: Introduction, Cambridge Univ. Press (1987).\n[2] M.
