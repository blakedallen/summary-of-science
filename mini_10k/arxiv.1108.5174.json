Current data analysis techniques can provide us with parameter estimation\nwith very narrow errors. However, an EMRI is not a two-body problem, since other stellar bodies orbiting\nnearby will influence the capture orbit. Any deviation from the isolated inspiral will induce a small, though\nobservable deviation from the idealised waveform which could be misinterpreted as a failure of GR. Based on\nconservative analysis of mass segregation in a Milky Way like nucleus, we estimate that the possibility that\nanother star has a semi-major axis comparable to that of the EMRI is non-negligible, although probably very\nsmall. This star introduces an observable perturbation in the orbit in the case in which we consider only loss\nof energy via gravitational radiation. When considering the two first-order non-dissipative post-Newtonian\ncontributions (the periapsis shift of the orbit), the evolution of the orbital elements of the EMRI turns out to\nbe chaotic in nature. The implications of this study are twofold. From the one side, the application to testing\nGR and measuring MBHs parameters with the detection of EMRIs in galactic nuclei with a millihertz mission\nwill be even more challenging than believed. From the other side, this behaviour could in principle be used as\na signature of mass segregation in galactic nuclei.\n1. MOTIVATION\n\nA stellar mass black hole or neutron star executes \u223c 105\u22126\norbits during the final year of inspiral toward a \u223c 106 M\u2299 supermassive black hole (MBH). The large number of cycles\nimplies that a phase-coherent measurement of the inspiral,\nachievable through detection of low frequency gravitational\nwaves, would be a tremendously powerful probe of the spacetime near a black hole (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2007; Hughes\n2009). Among other things, it would enable a precise determination of the spin of the supermassive black hole, and a test of\nGeneral Relativity that is independent of current constraints\nderived from pulsar timing data.\nThere is no foreseeable instrument sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals\n(EMRIs) over time scales comparable to the orbital period. As\na consequence, realizing the astrophysical and gravitational\nphysics promise of EMRIs requires an assurance that the inspiral can be accurately modeled over many orbits using templates calculated by solving the 2-body problem in General\nRelativity (for a review, see e.g., Barack 2009). It is therefore\nnecessary to assess whether gas, stars or other compact objects in the vicinity, could significantly perturb EMRI trajectories. In the case of gas, perturbations to stellar mass black\nholes or neutron stars6 are securely negligible provided that\n1 Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Gravitationsphysik (Albert-Einstein-Institut),\nD-14476 Potsdam, Germany\n2 Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies de l'Espai (CSIC-IEEC), Campus UAB, Torre C5, parells, 2na planta, ES-08193, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain\n3 Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, M\u00f6nchhofstrasse 12-14, 69120, Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Germany\n4 Departamento de Astronom\u00eda y Astrof\u00edsica, Pontificia Universidad\nCat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile\n5 JILA, University of Colorado and NIST, at Boulder, 440 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309-0440, USA\n6 White dwarf EMRIs are excluded here, because mass loss from the compact object itself could form a dynamically significant disc even if the background accretion flow is of low density(Zalamea, Menou & Beloborodov\n2010).\n\naccretion on to the black hole occurs in a low density, radiatively inefficient flow (Narayan 2000). Such flows are much\nmore common than dense accretion discs, which would yield\nobservable phase shifts during inspiral (Kocsis et al. 2011), at\nleast at the relatively low redshifts where EMRIs may be observed.\nIn this Letter, we quantify the nature and strength of possible perturbations from point mass perturbers: low mass stars\nor compact objects in tight orbits around the supermassive\nblack hole. Any perturbers are unlikely to orbit close enough\nto the EMRI to undergo strong interactions, so the regime of\ninterest is one where the third body is relatively distant and the\ninteraction weak. The Newtonian analog of this problem has\nbeen studied extensively in the context both of Solar System\nsatellite evolution, and for transit timing variations of extrasolar planets (Dermott, Malhotra & Murray 1988; Agol et al.\n2005; Holman & Murray 2005; Veras, Ford & Payne 2011).\nIn Newtonian gravity, perturbations are strong only at the location of mean motion resonances, and these have the effect\nof inducing small jumps in eccentricity upon divergent resonance crossing. This would already be interesting for the\nEMRI problem, since the jumps in eccentricity would result\nin a perturbation to the gravitational wave decay rate, and an\neventual dephasing of the waveform. However, as we will see,\nthe inclusion of post-Newtonian corrections changes the evolution qualitatively. Computing trajectories that include the\ntwo first-order non-dissipative post-Newtonian corrections,\nwe find evidence of dependence on initial conditions in the\nevolution of the perturbed inner binary, such that arbitrarily\nsmall variations in the initial orbit lead to significantly different future behaviour.\n2. ASTROPHYSICAL LIMITS ON PERTURBERS\n\nIs it likely that a star or compact object will be present close\nenough to perturb the orbit of an EMRI? Excluding low mass\nMBHs (M\u2022 < 106 M\u2299 ), where the stellar tidal disruption limit\ncomes into play, the existence of perturbers is not excluded by\n\n\f2\n106 M\u2299 < M\u2022 < 107 M\u2299 . Clearly, these crude estimates\ndo not demonstrate that most EMRIs will be perturbed by\nthird bodies, but they do suggest that perturbers may be close\nenough in some galaxies to motivate detailed consideration of\ntheir dynamical effects.\n3. METHODS\n\nF IG . 1.- Estimates for the semi-major axis of the innermost perturbing\nbody around a massive black hole, scaled to the hole's gravitational radius\nRg = GM\u2022 /c2 . The red lines show the location of the innermost star, estimated assuming that stars of mass 0.3 M\u2299 follow a single power-law cusp of\nindex \u03b3 in a galaxy on the M\u2022 -\u03c3 relation. The green line shows the tidal disruption limit for such stars. The blue lines show the average (upper) and 1%\nprobability (lower) location of the next nearest EMRI, assuming uncorrelated\ninspirals at a rate of 10\u22126 yr\u22121 .\n\nelementary arguments. Neither, however, is it easy to calculate the probability distribution of perturbers, whose proximity will depend upon the details of discreteness and relativistic effects very close to the MBH, and mass segregation and\nEMRI injection mechanisms in galactic nuclei (Preto et al.\n2004; Freitag et al. 2006; Amaro-Seoane et al. 2004).\nRather than face these difficulties, we limit ourselves here\nto order of magnitude estimates for the likely location of the\nnearest star and compact object. For stars, assumed to be of a\nsingle mass M\u2217 , we assume a cusp-like distribution with density profile \u03c1 \u221d R\u2212\u03b3 , extending from the MBH to its radius of\ninfluence RBH = GM\u2022 /\u03c3 2 . Here \u03c3 is the velocity dispersion of\nthe galaxy. Using the fact that the enclosed mass, M(R) \u2243 M\u2022\nat R = RBH , we find that the expected radius of the innermost\nstar, R1 , is,\n\u00131/(3\u2212\u03b3) \u0010 \u0011\n\u0012\nc 2\nM\u2217\nR1\n,\n(1)\n=\nRg\nM\u2022\n\u03c3\nwhere Rg = GM\u2022 /c2 . This formula yields an explicit estimate for R1 once we adopt a relation between M\u2022 and \u03c3\n(G\u00fcltekin et al. 2009). For the location of the next nearest\ncompact object (or EMRI), we use an even simpler approach.\nWe calculate the expected semi-major axis for uncorrelated\ninspirals due to gravitational radiation (Peters 1964), assuming near-circular orbits and rate \u1e44EMRI . Finally, we plot the\ntidal limit (e.g. Rees 1988) for 0.3 M\u2299 main-sequence stars.\nFigure 1 shows these estimates as a function of M\u2022 . For a\nstandard cusp slope \u03b3 = 1.75, there is likely to be a low mass\nstellar perturber within a few hundred Rg for M\u2022 > 106 M\u2299 .\nSimilarly, if the EMRI rate is as high as 10\u22126 yr\u22121 , there\nis a significant chance (at least a few percent) that a second compact object will be present between 10 \u2212 102 Rg for\n\nWe are interested in the secular effect of a star acting on\nan EMRI which will describe thousands of orbits in the detector bandwidth and slowly decay. The kind of effects on\nthe wave that we are looking at are tiny, though detectable,\nand the mass difference between the two binaries (the MBHEMRI and the MBH-star systems) is huge. We need therefore a numerical tool capable of integrating the plunging orbit\nof the EMRI while inducing a minimal error in the integration, since data analysis techniques can detect e.g. eccentricity differences of the order \u2206e \u223c 10\u22123 (Amaro-Seoane et al.\n2010; Porter & Sesana 2010; Key & Cornish 2011). We\nhence have chosen to use a direct N\u2212body approach (Aarseth\n1999, 2003), the planet code, written by Aarseth7 . This\nis the most expensive method because it involves integrating all gravitational forces for all three bodies at every time\nstep, without making any a priori assumptions about the system. Our approach employs the improved Hermite integration\nscheme, which requires computation of not only the accelerations but also their time derivatives. Since we are simply integrating Newton's equations directly, all gravitational effects\nare included. For the purpose of our study, nonetheless, we\nhave included relativistic corrections to the Newtonian forces\n(the forces can be found in the same page in the toy code8 ).\nThis was first implemented in a direct-summation N\u2212body\ncode by Kupi et al. (2006). For this, one has to add perturbations in the integration, so that the forces are modified by\nperiapsis shift\n\nenergy loss\n\nneglected\n\nNewt.\n}|\n{ z }| { z }| {\nz}|{ z\nF = F0 + c\u22122 F2 + c\u22124 F4 + c\u22125 F5 + O(c\u22126 )\n| {z } | {z } | {z }\n1PN\n\n2PN\n\n(2)\n\n2.5PN\n\nIn the last equation \"PN\" stands for post-Newtonian.

DISSIPATION OF ENERGY AND RESONANCES\n\nWe first analyse the system by contemplating only the relativistic effect of dissipation of energy; i.e. our simulations\nonly incorporate the 2.5 PN correction term. We stop the integration when the separation between the stellar BH and the\nMBH is a\u2022 = 5 RSchw , which approximately corresponds to the\nlimit where the PN approximation is not valid anymore. The\ninspiral down to this distance takes typically in our simulations some 440,000 orbits.\nIn Fig.(2) the test stellar black hole of mass m\u2022 = 10 M\u2299 has\nbeen initially set in such an orbit that it is totally embedded in\na LISA-like detector band (i.e. with an orbital period < 105\nsecs, namely P\u2022 = 6 \u00d7 103 secs) and is hence an EMRI; its\ninitial semi-major axis is a\u2022, i \u2243 1.45 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc and its eccentricity e\u2022, i = 0.05.

The mass of the MBH is M\u2022 = 106 M\u2299 ,\nthe mass of the stellar black hole is m\u2022 = 10 M\u2299 . See text for more details.\nLower panel: Same configuration but with an initial inclination of the star\nof i\u22c6 = 45\u25e6 instead of 30\u25e6 , i.e. the inclination triggers the Kozai mechanism,\nsince i\u22c6 > 39.2\u25e6 and the orbit is prograde. As mentioned in the previous case,\neven if the changes in eccentricity cannot be directly seen in the curve, they\nare of the order \u2206 e\u2022 \u223c 10\u22123 .\n\ninitially on an orbit in which the semi-major axis has the value\na\u22c6, i \u2243 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc and the eccentricity at T = 0 is e\u22c6, i = 0.5.\nThe inclination of the system EMRI \u2013 star was set to 30\u25e6 initially in the upper panel. This constitutes our reference system.\nIn the figure, the straight lines mark the condition P\u22c6 /P\u2022 =\nA, with A an integer, P\u22c6 the period of the star around the MBH\nand P\u2022 the period of the EMRI around the MBH; i.e. where\nthe resonances occur. The first three resonances have an impact on e\u2022 which can be seen on the plot; later resonances do\nalso affect e\u2022 , with \u2206 e\u2022 \u223c 10\u22123 . We also note that in the upper\npanel one can see in-between smaller jumps; they correspond\nto higher-order resonances, P\u22c6 /P\u2022 = 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5.\nWe made the choice for an initial inclination of 30\u25e6 to avoid\nanother effect that introduces a change in the eccentricity. In\nthe lower panel we have exactly the same system but for i\u22c6 =\n45\u25e6 . With this value, and the fact that the orbit is prograde, the\nKozai oscillation of eccentricity is present (Kozai 1962). Even\nif the eccentricity of the EMRI e\u2022 suffers the characteristic\nKozai oscillations, the loci for the resonances still fulfill the\ncondition P\u22c6 /P\u2022 = integer.\n5. DOES THE FLAP OF THE STAR AT APOAPSIS SET OFF A\nTORNADO AT PERIAPSIS?\n\nIn this subsection we address numerically the effect of including the relativistic periapsis shift along with the dissipation of energy; i.e. the set of corrections as specified in Eq.(2).\nAs we show below, the effect of the periapsis shift changes\ncompletely the evolution of the system. In Fig.(3) we show\n\nfour cases. One of them corresponds to the reference system\nbut taking into account the periapsis shift. We only display\nthese examples but note that the behaviour is also chaotic9\nfor other nearby choices of i\u22c6 . When using an initial inclination of i\u22c6 = 45\u25e6 , which corresponds to the same situation as\nin the lower panel of Fig.(2) but taking into account the periapsis shift, along with another case which is identical but\nfor i\u22c6 = 45.0000000001\u25e6, we find also a chaotic result which\nmoreover eliminates the secular Kozai oscillation of e.\nWe have systematically studied this chaotic behaviour by\nrunning hundreds of simulations in which we methodically\nincrease in minimal differences an initial dynamical orbital\nparameter such as the inclination, semi-major axis or eccentricity. In all cases and parameters the evolution corroborates\nthe chaotic behaviour of the system. We have also tested a\nmass for the perturbing star of 5 and 1.44 M\u2299 , as well as different values of e\u22c6 (0.1, 0.3, 0.7 and 0.9), with similar results.\nIn order to fence in the region within which the system is\nchaotic, we systematically increase the semi-major axis of the\nstar and run the same experiment. We start with the same difference in inclination at a slightly larger semi-major axis, and\nthen regularly increase it until we reach one order of magnitude over the fiducial case, as we depict in Fig.(4). The\nchaotic behaviour ceases at about one order of magnitude of\nthe initial value of a\u22c6 in the reference case.\n6. QUANTIFYING THE DEPENDENCE ON INITIAL CONDITIONS\nOF THE SYSTEM\n\nIn this section we present a way of characterizing the rate of\nseparation of infinitesimally close trajectories systematically.\nTo achieve this we compare our fiducial model with another\ncase in which we set up the EMRI in an (almost) imperceptibly different initial orbit (the initial difference is 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 pc,\nwhile the objects are moving on the same ellipse) and keep the\nsame initial conditions of the MBH and the perturber. Hence\nEMRI in the second case differs only from the reference case\nslightly and has an initial distance separation of r0 . We say\nthat the two models are in phase provided that\n9 When we use the word, we do not follow the rigorous mathematical\ndefinition of chaos. We mean a strong dependence on the initial conditions.\n\n\f4\n0.055\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.045\n\n0.045\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.035\n\n0.035\n\n0.03\ne\u2022\n\ne\u2022\n\n0.03\n0.025\n\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\n0.015\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nTime (109 sec)\n0.05\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n10\u22125\n\n10\u22125\n\n10\u22126\n\n10\u22126\n\n0.05\n0.045\n0.04\n0.035\n0.03\n0.025\n\ne\u2022\n\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\n0.015\n\n10\u22127\n\nSeparation (pc)\n\n0.04\n0.035\n\nSeparation (pc)\n\n0.045\n\ne\u2022\n\n1\n\nTime (109 sec)\n\nbe at such a radius from the EMRI system that it will significantly perturb it.

We thence are able to estimate a characteristic timescale \u03c4deph for the system to become out of phase. In\nFig.(5) we display the separation of the two systems for different distances to the perturber. From these figures we can measure the value of a characteristic timescale \u03c4deph for a given\na\u22c6 .\nFrom the data points obtained in the upper panels of Fig.(5)\nwe can then derive the relation displayed in the lower panel.\nFor large enough distances, of the order of \u223c 10\u22125 pc the two\ntimescales converge and the system becomes deterministic.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have addressed the role of a perturbation\non an EMRI by a nearby star. The system depends extremely\non minimal changes in the initial conditions (as small as a\n10\u22129 part in the inclination) lead to a very different dynamical evolution. In all cases, however, the Kozai mechanism is\nwashed out by the periapsis shift, as one can expect (see e.g.\nHolman et al. 1997; Blaes et al. 2002). For distances of the\norder of a\u22c6 \u223c 10\u22125 pc the system enters the chaotic regime,\nfor perturbing masses as small as 1.44 M\u2299 . While we cannot state clearly whether this will be a common feature for\nEMRIs, since the different dynamical and relativistic phenomena involved in the problem are many and not straightforward (see for a review Amaro-Seoane et al. 2007 and also\nAmaro-Seoane 2011 for a dedicated review of the dynamics),\nit seems plausible that for a Milky Way-like galaxy a star can\n\n0.1\n\n0.001\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\na\u22c6 (10\u22126 pc)\n\nF IG . 5.- Upper panels: From the left to the right and from the top to the\nbottom we show the separation r for a increasing separation of the perturbing\nstar of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 , 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 , 4.375 \u00d7 10\u22126 , and 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc.
