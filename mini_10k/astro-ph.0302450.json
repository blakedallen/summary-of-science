Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the \u039bCDM cosmology, we\nshow, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy\nmerging and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes\nwhereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk\ngas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; (3) complete expulsion of cold\ndisk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of\nthe galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed at large\nluminosities. Feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity\nfunction. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos\nis strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centres of halos was very\nefficient, or if a substantial amount of gas was expelled from halos by process (3) above. Conduction is a\npromising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired\nlevel. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget\nrequired to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available\nfrom supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black\nholes and associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in\nthe host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function, also give reasonable\napproximations to the Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.\nSubject headings: galaxies: luminosity function - galaxies: formation - conduction - cooling flows\nveys such as the 2dFGRS and 2MASS (Cole et al. 2001;\nKochanek et al. 2001).\nWhile the key physics of gas cooling and merging are\nnow thought to be modeled with reasonable accuracy\n(Benson et al. 2001, 2002; Yoshida et al. 2002; Helly et al.\n2003; Voit et al. 2002), other physics crucial to establishing\nthe shape of the luminosity function remain poorly understood. The first uncertainty is the \"feedback\" needed to\nregulate the formation of dwarf galaxies, and hence reconcile the rather shallow slope of the faint end of the observed\nluminosity function with the relatively steep mass function\nof dark matter halos. While outflows of gas from galaxies\nhave been observed at both low and high redshift (Martin 1999; Pettini et al. 2002), the complex physics at work\nhas not yet been understood in detail, and most models of\ngalaxy formation simply adopt phenomenological rules to\ndescribe their effects. Previous work has typically assumed\nthat the dominant feedback mechanism is the reheating of\ncold gas in the disk to the temperature of the diffuse gas\nhalo (White & Frenk 1991; Cole et al. 1994; Kauffmann\net al. 1999; Efstathiou 2000), although complete expulsion\nof disk gas from the halo was considered by Somerville\n\n1. introduction\n\nThe luminosity function of galaxies is one of the most\nbasic properties of the galaxy population; yet it contains\nmany valuable clues to the process of galaxy formation.\nThe basic physical mechanisms which determine the form\nof the luminosity function were first described by Rees &\nOstriker (1977) and White & Rees (1978). In this picture, galaxy formation is regulated by the rate at which\ngas is able to cool in the parent dark matter halos. These\nauthors suggested that the sharp cut-off in the galaxy luminosity function arose from the long cooling times of gas\nin high mass halos (or high mass protogalaxies in the case\nof Rees & Ostriker). The model has been developed by\nmany authors to follow in great detail the formation of\ngalaxies in a hierarchical universe. Key improvements are\nthe inclusion of galaxy merging and the evolution of stellar\npopulations (White & Frenk 1991; Cole 1991; Kauffmann,\nWhite & Guiderdoni 1993; Lacey et al. 1993; Cole et al.\n1994; Kauffmann et al. 1999; Somerville & Primack 1999;\nCole et al. 2000; Benson et al. 2002). Such models are\nnow being strongly tested by high-precision measurements\nof the galaxy luminosity function from large redshift sur1\n\n\f2\n\nBenson et al.\n\n& Primack (1999). However, although this form of feedback solves the problem with the faint-end slope of the\nluminosity function (as it was originally designed to do),\nit creates a second problem matching the very sharp (exponential with luminosity) cut-off seen at the bright end.\nIn addition, the effectiveness with which the gas needs to\nbe reheated seems excessive compared to observations of\ngalactic outflows (Martin 1999) and to what is seen in simulations of this process in individual galaxies (Strickland\n& Stevens 2000). These papers suggest that the mass in\nthe outflow is comparable to the gas mass that is turned\ninto stars.\nAll current models of galaxy formation, calculated using either gas-dynamical simulations (Pearce et al. 2001;\nKay et al. 2002; Katz et al. 2002; Weinberg et al. 2003)\nor semi-analytic techniques (e.g. Kauffmann et al. 1999;\nSomerville & Primack 1999; Cole et al. 2000), exhibit\nstrong gas cooling in the central regions of groups and\nclusters. This leads to the formation of extremely bright\ngalaxies (which are never seen in reality) unless some additional suppression of the gas cooling is assumed. The suppression mechanisms which have been considered in semianalytical models are: simply switching off cooling and/or\nstar formation in the most massive halos, e.g. Kauffmann\net al. (1999); redistributing the gas within the halo so that\nit becomes so rarefied that its cooling time is longer than\nthe age of the Universe, e.g. Cole et al. (2000); or suppressing cooling until the halo is completely virialized, e.g. van\nKampen et al. (1999). The model presented in Cole et al.\n(2000) adopted a low value for the cosmic baryon fraction\n(\u03a9b = 0.02), and a model for the halo gas distribution\nin which the core radius was a function of the amount\nof gas that had cooled in previous generations of halos.\nIn combination, these assumptions were able to produce\na good match to the galaxy luminosity function; however,\nboth are now disfavored by current observational data (e.g.\nO'Meara et al. 2001; Allen et al. 2001; Ettori et al. 2002).\nIf the more recent, higher value of the baryon abundance\n(\u03a9b \u2248 0.04) is adopted, the growing core radius has little\neffect on the cooling rates (since the cooling radius is then\nsignificantly beyond the typical core radii).\nIn this paper, we investigate physical processes that may\nbe responsible for shaping the bright end of the luminosity\nfunction. In addition to the conventional feedback process,\nin which cold gas in the disk is reheated to the temperature of the diffuse gas halo, the feedback energy may be\nused to regulate the formation of the galaxy in two further\nways. While the wind flowing from the gas disk may contain a relatively small mass, the energy in the disk outflow\nmay be transferred to the existing hot gas halo, causing\nit to expand within the halo potential. This makes the\ncentral gas more diffuse, lengthens its cooling time and\nso reduces the rate at which gas is supplied to the cold\ndisk. This type of process is seen in simulations of the\neffect of injection of relativistic radio-emitting plasma in\nthe centres of clusters (Quilis et al. 2001; Br\u00fcggen et al.\n2002). An alternative is to assume that the gas expelled\nfrom the disk does not mix with the virialized diffuse gas\nhalo, and that the energy per particle is sufficiently high\nthat the material escapes the confining potential and is\nnever recaptured.\nA further means by which the supply of cold gas to the\n\ngalaxy disk may be reduced is suggested by recent Chandra and XMM observations of galaxy clusters (Peterson et\nal. 2001; Tamura et al. 2001; Fabian et al. 2001; Johnstone\net al. 2002; B\u00f6hringer et al. 2002; McNamara et al. 2001;\nNulsen et al. 2002). These have led to a revival of the\nidea that thermal conduction may be an important source\nof heating in the central regions of clusters (Narayan &\nMedvedev 2001; Gruzinov 2002; Voigt et al. 2002). Indeed, the conductivity has been inferred to be close to the\nSpitzer rate expected for a fully ionized plasma (Fabian,\nVoigt & Morris 2002). As first suggested by Fabian, Voigt\n& Morris (2002), heating due to conduction could plausibly counteract the excessive cooling predicted to occur in\nthe most massive halos and thereby explain the dearth of\nhighly luminous galaxies in the Universe.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we will demonstrate\nquantitatively the importance of each physical mechanism\nand its role in setting the form of the luminosity function.\nWe will demonstrate that the milder forms of feedback are\nunable to account simultaneously for the sharp break in\nthe luminosity function and for the flat faint-end slope.\nThe two processes discussed above, thermal conduction\nand superwinds, may provide the answer to this problem.\nThermal conduction is capable of suppressing the formation of the brightest objects if the conductive efficiency is\nhigh. Alternatively, a model that includes energetic gas\nexpulsion is also able to produce reasonable fits to the\nobserved luminosity function, but the energy required to\npower this \"superwind\" is larger than that available from\nsupernova explosions and stellar winds.\n2. the model\n\nWe compute the luminosity function of galaxies in a cold\ndark matter Universe using a development of the semianalytic model, galform, described by Cole et al. (2000).\nOur changes to the model concern the treatment of the gas\ndistribution in halos, and the treatment of feedback.\n2.1. Feedback\nIn Cole et al. (2000), the star formation rate was affected by feedback generated when cold gas is reheated\nby energy injected by supernovae explosions and stellar\nwinds. This process transfers gas from the star-forming\ndisk of the galaxy to a diffuse corona or halo. The rate at\nwhich cold gas is reheated is assumed to be related to the\nstar formation rate, \u1e40\u22c6 , by:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b1\nVdisk\n\u1e40reheat =\n\u1e40\u22c6 ,\n(1)\nVhot\nwhere Vdisk is the circular speed at the half-mass radius\nof the gas disk, and Vhot and \u03b1 are adjustable parameters. Here we include this feedback mechanism, but we\nalso consider two further schemes which correspond to\ndifferent processes by which the energy from supernova\nexplosions and stellar winds can regulate the gas cooling\nand star formation rates. A further fraction of the total\nenergy will be radiated away and so is not available for\nfeedback. We assume that the way the energy is apportioned amongst the three processes is fixed by the local\nsupernova environment, and does not depend on the mass\n\n\fWhat Shapes the Luminosity Function of Galaxies?\nof the galaxy or on the instantaneous star formation rate.1\nThus, feedback in our model is specified by three parameters: \u01ebreheat , \u01ebhalo , \u01ebsw . It is useful to note that the total\nenergy available from supernovae is of order 1049 erg for\neach Solar mass of stars that is formed, for a standard\nIMF.\n1. Disk reheating. This is the feedback scheme explored by Cole et al. (2000). Gas is removed from\nthe disk of the galaxy at a rate proportional to the\nstar formation rate. This gas can be thought of as\neither being ejected at close to, but below the escape velocity of the halo, or as being heated to the\nhalo virial temperature. In the first case, the gas\nwill subsequently be heated back to the halo virial\ntemperature, through mixing with the halo gas, or\nthrough further shocks when a new halo forms. In\neither case, the gas does not leave the halo and so is\navailable for cooling in the future. We parameterize\nthe energy invested in reheating the cold disk gas\nas \u01ebreheat 1049 erg per Solar mass of stars formed. If\nwe approximate the gravitational potential wells of\ngalaxies as being self-similar, then the energy required to eject the gas from the disk should scale\n2\nas Vdisk\n, and one obtains formula (1) above with\n\u03b1 = \u22122. Specifically, if we assume that gas is\n2\n,\nejected with energy per unit mass equal to Vdisk\nthen the rate at which gas is reheated is given by:\n5.6\u01ebreheat\n\u1e40reheat =\n(2)\n2 \u1e40\u2217 .\n(Vdisk /300 km s\u22121 )\nWe therefore have the following relation between\n\u01ebreheat and Vhot :\n\u00132\n\u0012\nVhot\n,\n(3)\n\u01ebreheat = 0.18\n300 km s\u22121\nIf the circular speed of the disk is equal to Vhot , the\nmass of gas reheated is equal to the mass formed\ninto stars. Feedback of this form is motivated by\nthe study of Efstathiou (2000), although the efficiency assumed here is somewhat higher.\n2. Energy injection into the gaseous halo. The feedback energy is assumed to redistribute the hot, diffuse gas so that the central density of the gas is\nreduced, and the central cooling time is increased.\nThe energy injected per unit mass of stars formed\n\u22121\nis parameterized as \u01ebhalo 1049 erg M\u2299\n. The nature\nof this type of feedback process can be understood\nas follows: the total energy injected into the halo\ngrows with time until it becomes comparable to the\ngravitational binding energy of the gaseous halo.\nAt this point, the cooling rate drops dramatically.\nSince the binding energy of a halo is proportional to\n5/3\nMhalo , the fraction of the total gaseous mass which\nmust be turned into stars to achieve this balance\nis strongly dependent on halo mass. Larger halos\nare therefore able to cool a larger fraction of their\nbaryon reservoir to form galaxies. This mechanism\nis described in more detail in Bower et al. (2001)\nand, as noted above, is motivated by simulations\n1\n\n3\n\nof the injection of radio plasma in cluster centres\n(Quilis et al. 2001; Br\u00fcggen et al. 2002).\n3. Gas expulsion from the halo. In this scheme, an\n\u22121\nenergy of \u01ebsw 1049 erg M\u2299\nis invested in heating a\nsmall mass of the cold gas disk to an energy much\ngreater than the binding energy of the halo. If\nthe energy is contained within this super-heated\nphase (and is not shared with the diffuse gas halo,\nas assumed in mechanism 2 above), the wind may\nbe able to escape completely from the halo. This\nmechanism is motivated by the strong, high velocity\nwinds inferred to exist around Lyman-break galaxies (Pettini et al. 2002; Adelberger et al. 2003) and\nhas recently been studied theoretically by Shu, Mo\n& Mao (2003). We assume that the energy is injected with a thermal distribution of particle energies, i.e. so that the fraction of mass ejected with\nenergy in the range E to E + dE is proportional to\nexp(\u2212E/Eav )dE, where Eav is the mean ejection\nenergy per particle. The fraction of the superwind\ngas with sufficient energy to escape the halo is computed using this distribution. Some of the expelled\ngas will be recaptured when a deeper potential well\nforms. To estimate this, we calculate the fraction\nof the expelled gas with energy less than the depth\nof the new potential well, and allow this fraction\nto be recaptured. This process continues as deeper\npotential wells form until either all of the gas is recaptured, or z = 0 is reached.\nWe assume that the mass flux of material in the\nwind as it leaves the disk, \u1e40superwind, is proportional to the star formation rate, with coefficient of\nproportionality \u03b2SW . The energy in the superwind\nas it leaves the disk is given by\n\u0116superwind = 1049 \u01ebSW \u1e40\u22c6 ergs,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere 1049 \u01ebSW ergs is the energy per unit mass of\nstar formation. The characteristic specific energy of\nthe wind is simply Eav = \u0116superwind /\u1e40superwind \u2261\n1 2\n2 VSW , and so the characteristic velocity of the wind\nis\np\nVSW = 1002 \u01ebSW /\u03b2SW km/s.\n(5)\n\nWe assume that material ejected from the disk re2\nquires an energy per unit mass \u03bbSW Vdisk\nin order\nto escape also from the halo. Therefore, in the\ncase in which all of the wind material has the same\nenergy, superwinds\nwill be driven from halos with\np\nVdisk < 709 \u01ebSW /\u03b2SW \u03bbSW km/s, and not from\ndeeper potential wells. For typical halos in our\nmodel \u03bbSW = 2.9 gives a good estimate of the energy required to escape the combined gravitational\npull of the galaxy and its dark matter halo, and\nso we use this value throughout this work. If we\nassume a distribution of energies in the wind, then\nthere will be a smooth transition, as Vdisk increases,\nbetween the regime in which the wind escapes and\nthe regime in which it is retained. Thus, the actual\n\nIn principle the supernova's local environment-the interstellar medium-could depend on global properties of the galaxy, such as its mass,\nbut we neglect any such dependence here.\n\n\f4\n\nBenson et al.\nmass flux in the superwind escaping from the halo\nis given by\n2\n\u1e40superwind = feject(Eav /\u03bbSW Vdisk\n) \u03b2SW \u1e40\u22c6 , (6)\nwhere, for our chosen energy distribution,\nfeject(x) = exp(\u2212x). The material which does\nescape may be recaptured by larger halos forming\nat later times. Our estimate of the fraction of the\nwind which escapes and that which can be recaptured by larger halos is described in Appendix A.\nWe regard this mechanism as being more uncertain\nthan mechanisms 1 and 2 because the expelled gas\nmust leave the halo without sharing its energy with\nthe diffuse hot component. It must therefore punch\na well collimated hole through the halo, or remain\ncontained within a buoyant bubble which is convected out of the halo (Quilis et al. 2001; Springel\n& Hernquist 2003; Kay et al. 2002).\n\nIn general, it seems plausible that some fraction of the\ntotal feedback energy will be processed into each one of\nthese forms, and we consider models which include a combination of these processes on an equal footing with models\nthat include only one.\n2.2. Halo Gas Distribution\nThe hot gaseous component in dark matter halos is assumed initially to have a density profile, \u03c1g (r), given by\nthe \u03b2-model, ie, at radius r in the halo (whose dark matter density profile is assumed to have the NFW profile,\nNavarro, Frenk & White 1996, 1997),\n\u03c10\n,\n(7)\n\u03c1g (r) =\n[1 + (r/rc )2 ]3\u03b2/2\nwhere \u03c10 is the density at the centre of the halo, rc is the\nradius of the \"core\" and \u03b2 is a parameter which sets the\nslope of the profile on scales larger than rc .\nDeparting from the prescription of Cole et al. (2000),\nwe adopt a gas density profile in the absence of energy injection with fixed rc = 0.07rvir (and \u03b2 = 2/3) in all halos.\nThis provides a reasonable match to gas-dynamic simulations of non-radiative gas in clusters (e.g. Eke, Navarro\n& Frenk 1998) and to the observed X-ray profiles of relaxed clusters (e.g. Allen et al. 2001). The normalization\nof the profile is determined by the total diffuse gas mass\nremaining in the halo, and the temperature of the gas is\nset assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. As a boundary condition, we set the temperature at the virial radius equal\nto the virial temperature (eqn. 4.1 in Cole et al. 2000).\nThis \"default\" profile is modified if the diffuse gas gains\nfurther energy (\"excess energy\") as a result of energy injection (process 2 in Section 2.1). We use the prescription\ndescribed in Bower et al. (2001), in which the excess energy first causes the slope of the gas profile to decrease\ndown to a minimum value of \u03b2min = 0.2, after which it\nincreases the boundary temperature of the gas halo. The\neffect of the excess energy is to decrease the central density\nof the gas, lengthening its cooling time. Mass is conserved\nby pushing some of the diffuse gas outside the halo; however, this gas can be recaptured as the total halo mass\n(and thus the gravitational binding energy) increases. We\nassume that the excess energy is conserved during mergers\nbetween halos, although the results are not qualitatively\n\naffected by a small dilution or amplification of energy during halo mergers.\nWe define the effective cooling time at radius r, t\u2032cool (r),\nas the maximum true cooling time (i.e. that defined by\nCole et al. 2000) occurring at smaller radii, plus the freefall time from r to the halo centre. This ensures that\ndt\u2032cool /dr > 0, so the cooling radius is always a smoothly\nincreasing function of radius. Experiments with different\napproaches show that the results we present here are not\nsensitive to the details of this prescription.\n2.3. Conduction\nConduction in the ionized gas can transport energy into\nthe inner regions of the halo, effectively increasing the cooling time of the gas there. The rate at which energy is deposited into the shell between radii r and r + dr is given\nby:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\ndT\n\u03a3dr = 4\u03c0\n\u03bar2\ndr,\n(8)\ndr\ndr\nwhere the conductivity, \u03ba, may depend on radius through\nits temperature dependence. We approximate \u03a3 as\n\u03a3 = \u03b1cond 4\u03c0\u03bas T,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bas is the Spitzer conductivity (Spitzer 1962), and\n\u03b1cond is a parameter that absorbs the dependence on the\nshape of the temperature profile as well as any difference\nbetween the actual conductivity and the Spitzer rate. For\na power-law temperature profile, T \u221d ra , and conductivity of the Spitzer form, \u03bas \u221d T 5/2 , \u03b1cond = fsp a(1 + 7a/2)\nwhere fsp is the ratio of the conductivity to the Spitzer\nvalue. Adopting a temperature profile with a = 0.4 as\nsuggested by recent X-ray observations (Voigt et al. 2002)\ngives \u03b1cond = 0.96fsp . Adopting a linear temperature gradient gives \u03b1cond = 4.5fsp .\nThe heating rate due to conduction is subtracted from\nthe radiative cooling rate to give a net cooling rate for the\ngas. This net cooling rate is used to compute the cooling time. Conduction causes the cooling radius to become\nsmaller than in the standard model. The result is a suppression of cooling in hot halos, and the mass at which this\neffect becomes important is determined by the parameter\n\u03b1cond .\n2.4. Photoionization and Merging\nWhile we employ the detailed model of galaxy merging developed by Benson et al. (2002), we choose to use a\nmuch simpler model of the effects of reionization than used\nin that paper, in order to incorporate them easily into our\ncalculation of the galaxy luminosity function. We simply\nassume that galaxy formation is completely suppressed by\nreionization in dark matter halos with circular velocities\nbelow Vreion after redshift zreion . Unless otherwise stated,\nwe adopt Vreion = 50 km s\u22121 and zreion = 6. With this\nchoice, this simple model matches the results of the full\ncalculation of Benson et al. (2002) quite well.\n3. results\n\nThroughout this paper, we use the same parameter values adopted by Benson et al. (2002), with the exception\nof a larger baryon fraction corresponding to \u03a9b = 0.045,\n\n\fWhat Shapes the Luminosity Function of Galaxies?\nconsistent with constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis (O'Meara et al. 2001). We assume a \u039bCDM universe\nwith mean matter density \u03a90 = 0.3, cosmological constant\nterm \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, Hubble constant2 H0 = 70km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand linear fluctuation amplitude on spheres of radius 8h\u22121\nMpc, \u03c38 = 0.9. Of these parameters, the uncertainty in the\nvalue of \u03c38 has most impact on the model results. While\nseveral studies support a value of \u03c38 \u223c 0.9 (e.g., Bacon et\nal. (2002), Hoekstra et al. (2002) [gravitational lensing];\nEke, Cole & Frenk (1996), Vianna et al. (2002) [cluster\nabundance]; Spergel et al. (2003) [cosmic microwave background (CMB)]; Sievers et al. (2003) [Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect]), other recent analyses have suggested lower values, \u03c38 \u223c 0.7 (e.g., Peacock (2003) [large scale structure];\nMelchiori et al. (2002) [CMB]; Jarvis et al. (2003) [gravitational lensing]; Allen et al. (2003), Smith et al. (2003)\n[cluster abundance]). A discussion of recent results may\nbe found in Wang et al. (2003). Except where specified, we\nshow models based on \u03c38 = 0.9; however, (as we shall see)\ntaking the lower value, \u03c38 = 0.7, considerably eases the\nenergy budget and/or reduces the conduction efficiency required to match the galaxy luminosity function. Throughout, we use the halo mass function derived from N-body\nsimulations by Jenkins et al. (2001)3 , instead of the PressSchechter mass function used by Cole et al. (2000).\n\n5\n\nthe K-band luminosity function assuming a Kennicutt stellar initial mass function (Kennicutt 1983). In order to\nfacilitate comparison between models, we have kept the\nIMF fixed, and assumed a negligible fraction of brown\ndwarf stars4 . We choose the K-band in order to minimize the sensitivity of our results to recent star formation\nand to dust obscuration. The model of Cole et al. (2000)\nincludes a detailed and fully self-consistent calculation of\ndust extinction which is used in this work. We find, however, that dust-obscuration has a negligible effect on our\nresults for the K-band luminosity function (typically shifting the bright end faintwards by less than one tenth of a\nmagnitude.) For the observational comparison, we use the\nlocal K-band luminosity functions measured by Cole et\nal. (2001) and Kochanek et al. (2001) (both based on the\n2MASS survey) and the local (z < 0.1) luminosity function\nderived from the much deeper K-band survey of Huang et\nal. (2002). The analysis by Huang et al. suggests a faintend slope (\u03b1K = \u22121.37 \u00b1 0.10), steeper than the values\nfound by Cole et al (\u03b1K = \u22120.93) and by Kochaneck et al.\n(\u03b1K = \u22121.09). These latter two are also in good agreement\nwith the faint end slope of the z-band luminosity function\nmeasured by Blanton et al. (\u03b1z = \u22121.08) from the SDSS\nsurvey. The z-band data should also be little affected by\nresidual star formation and dust extinction, but have a\ndeeper surface brightness limit. These discrepancies indicate that there remain significant systematic uncertainties\nin current measurements of the faint end of the K-band\nluminosity function, perhaps due to luminosity from lowsurface brightness regions of galaxies being missed as recently suggested by Andreon (2002).\n3.1. A Model with constant mass-to-light ratio\nIn Fig. 1 we show the simplest possible model of the\nluminosity function which we call Model 1 (shown as the\ndashed line). In this model, the mass function of dark\nmatter halos (Jenkins et al. 2001) has been converted into\na luminosity function simply by assuming a fixed mass-tolight ratio (M/LK = 11M\u2299 /LK,\u2299), chosen so as to match\nthe knee of the observed luminosity function. As is well\nknown, this produces a luminosity function which is much\nsteeper at the faint end than is observed, and also fails to\ncut off at bright magnitudes (the halo mass function does\npossess a cut-off, but it occurs at much higher mass and\nlower abundance than shown in the plot).\n3.2. Model including Cooling only\n\nFig. 1.- The K-band luminosity function of galaxies. The points\nshow the observational determinations of Cole et al. (2001, circles),\nKochanek et al. (2001, squares) and Huang et al. (2002, z < 0.1,\nstars). Lines show model results. Model 1 (dashed line) shows the\nresult of converting the dark matter halo mass function into a galaxy\nluminosity function by assuming a fixed mass-to-light ratio chosen\nto match the knee of the luminosity function. Model 2 (dotted line)\nshows the result from galform when no feedback, photoionization\nsuppression, galaxy merging or conduction are included. Models 3\nand 4 (long dashed and solid lines respectively) show the effects of\nadding photoionization and then galaxy merging.\n\nWe compare our model with recent determinations of\n2\n\nWhite & Rees (1978) argued that the difference between\nthe halo mass and the galaxy luminosity functions is due\nto the dependence of the gas cooling time on halo mass and\nto feedback processes. We use the galform semi-analytic\nmodel to follow gas cooling and star formation in a merging\nhierarchy of dark matter halos in the \u039bCDM cosmology. In\norder to illustrate the simplest possible model first, we do\nnot include photoionization suppression, feedback, galaxy\nmerging or conduction. The result is Model 2 (shown as\na dotted line in Fig. 1). It clearly displays the \"overcool-\n\nHere and below h denotes the Hubble constant in units of 100km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n3 Note that we use the Jenkins et al. (2001) mass function to compute the abundances of halos at z = 0, but retain the Press-Schechter\napproximation when computing halo merger trees. An improved calculation would use a self-consistent computation of halo merging histories.\n4 We set \u03a5 = 1 in the notation of Cole et al. (2000)\n\n\f6\n\nBenson et al.\n\ning problem\": gas has cooled into the smallest halos resolved in the calculation, producing an overabundance of\nfaint galaxies. As a result, the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is much too steep. It should be noted\nthat the results for this cooling-only model are sensitive\nto the mass resolution of the galform merger trees. The\ncooling time for halo gas decreases with decreasing halo\nmass down to halo virial temperatures around 104 K. Below this scale, cooling becomes ineffective unless molecular\nhydrogen is abundant. This means that for the luminosity\nfunction to be fully converged at all galaxy luminosities,\nwe would need to resolve halos with virial temperatures as\nlow as 104 K at all redshifts at which there is significant\ncooling. To obtain the results shown for Model 2, we ran\ngalform at the highest mass resolution that was computationally feasible, which comes close to resolving 104 K\nhalos at z = 0. We believe that our results are substantially converged, but we cannot be certain that they would\nnot change if the mass resolution were increased further.\n\nFig. 2.- Model 5. Starting from Model 4, disk-reheating is\nadded in order to suppress the formation of small galaxies. Results\nare shown for three levels of energy input (\u01ebreheat = 0.03, 0.13 and\n0.41). The data points are the same as Fig. 1.\n\n3.4. Model with feedback-disk reheating\n\n3.3. Model with photoionization and merging\nThe problem of mass resolution encountered in Model 2\nis effectively removed once we include feedback processes\nwhich are effective in low-mass halos. Model 3 (longdashed line in Fig. 1) shows the effects of including photoionization suppression. As described by Benson et al.\n(2002), the formation of low-mass galaxies is suppressed\nafter the Universe is reionized and, as we noted in \u00a72, we\nadopt a simplified model of this process which nevertheless\nis a good approximation to a full calculation. The resolution of the galform merger trees is then sufficient to follow the lowest mass halos that are able to form galaxies, resulting in a converged solution. However, photoionization\nsuppression alone is unable to produce a sufficiently flat\nfaint end in the luminosity function. In addition, Model 3\nalso produces more bright galaxies, since less gas has been\nlocked into stars in the smallest halos. When both galaxy\nmerging (which was artificially switched off in Models 1\nand 2) and photoionization are included, as in Model 4\n(solid line in Fig. 1), the faint end remains too steep and\neven more bright galaxies are produced. In the models\nthat follow, we investigate the effects of including feedback\nprocesses in addition to photoionization and merging.\n\nA solution to the faint-end problem is illustrated by\nModel 5.3 in Fig. 2. Here, feedback is included through\nthe reheating of disk gas in star-forming galaxies. We\nuse the standard prescription of Cole et al. (2000), but\nwith a larger value of \u01ebreheat = 0.41 (equivalent to Vhot =\n450 km s\u22121 ) which is required in order to obtain a similar\nfaint end slope to that in Cole et al. for the larger value of\n\u03a9b assumed in this work. This form of feedback flattens\nthe luminosity function considerably, resulting in reasonably good agreement with the observed faint end. While\nthe slope is not as flat as that measured by Cole et al.\n(2001) or Blanton et al. (2003), it is in good agreement\nwith the steeper slope reported by Huang et al. (2002).\nThis achievement carries a price, however-the overabundance of bright galaxies (formed through excessive cooling\nin massive halos) is exacerbated, as there is now a much\ngreater mass of diffuse hot gas remaining in the larger\nhalos. This gas is sufficiently dense that the central regions are able to cool; consequently, Model 5.3 produces\nfar too many bright galaxies. This result depends little on\nthe choice of \u03c38 . Adopting \u03c38 = 0.7 makes the brightest\ngalaxies only 0.5 mag fainter. This clearly demonstrates\na longstanding problem in semi-analytic models: previous\ncalculations have either assumed low values of \u03a9b , or have\ninvoked rather artificial ways to prevent the cooling which\nforms these overluminous objects.\n\n\fWhat Shapes the Luminosity Function of Galaxies?\n\n7\n\ngas from dark matter halos at such high energies that it is\nsubsequently unable to cool.\n\nFig. 3.- Model 6. These models illustrate the effect of energy\ninjection. Starting from Model 5.3, the effect of heating the diffuse\ngas halo is included. Models 6.1\u20136.3 have \u01ebhalo = 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0\nrespectively, in addition to \u01ebreheat = 0.41. Increasing the energy\navailable for this form of feedback suppresses the formation of both\nbright and faint galaxies, but does not produce a sharp break in the\nluminosity function.\n\nThe energy requirements of Model 5.3 are substantial, but not excessive. The reheating energy of 0.41 \u00d7\n\u22121\n1049 erg M\u2299\nshould be compared to the total energy available from supernovae explosions which is approximately\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0.7\u00d71049 erg M\u2299\nfor a Salpeter IMF, or 0.9\u00d71049 erg M\u2299\nfor the Kennicutt IMF adopted in galform. In a halo of\ncircular velocity 250 km/s, the mass of gas reheated is\nmore than 3 times the mass of gas formed into stars. If\nthe level of reheating is reduced, as illustrated by models 5.1 (\u01ebreheat = 0.03) and 5.2 (\u01ebreheat = 0.13), then the\nformation of small galaxies is not suppressed sufficiently\nto match the observed luminosity function.\n3.5. Models with energy injection\nIn Models 6.1\u20136.3 (Fig 3), we investigate the effect of\nassuming that a fraction of the supernova and stellar wind\nenergy heats the diffuse gas halo, causing it to expand.\nThis form of feedback suppresses the formation of both\nbright and faint galaxies, but it does not produce a sharp\nbreak in the luminosity function. Models 6.1 and 6.2 illustrate how as the energy spent in heating the diffuse halo\nincreases, the break in the luminosity function becomes\nless pronounced. If the heating is made even stronger,\nthe resulting luminosity function approaches a power-law\n(Model 6.3). This form of feedback clearly cannot solve\nthe problem of overproduction of bright galaxies.\n3.6. Model with conduction\nWe now consider two possible schemes that are capable of producing a good match to the observed luminosity\nfunction. The first involves balancing radiative cooling\nwith thermal conduction. The second involves expelling\n\nFig. 4.- Model 7. These models illustrate the effect of thermal\nconduction. In Model 7.3 (\u03b1cond = 25), conduction is assumed to\nbe highly efficient (it is unlikely that such a high efficiency is physically plausible). More realistic conduction efficiencies are illustrated\nin Models 7.2 (\u03b1cond = 1) and 7.1 (\u03b1cond = 0.1). For Model 7.4,\nwe adopt a lower value for \u03c38 ; a conduction efficiency of \u03b1cond = 7\nthen gives a reasonable match to the observed luminosity function.\nIn all cases, the energy feedback parameters parameters are set to\n\u01ebhalo = 0.0 and \u01ebreheat = 0.41.\n\nThermal conduction is expected to imprint a special\nscale on the galaxy population because of the strong\ntemperature dependence of the Spitzer conductivity rate.\nModel 7.3 (solid line in Fig. 4) shows the result of including\nconduction with \u03b1cond = 25 in Model 5.3 (\u01ebreheat = 0.41,\n\u01ebhalo = 0). Such a high value of the conductivity is indeed\neffective in suppressing the formation of the most massive\ngalaxies since it prevents efficient gas cooling in group and\ncluster-sized halos. The brightest galaxies in the luminosity function are instead built through mergers. The result\nis a rather good match to the observed galaxy luminosity\nfunction. However, the conduction efficiency that we have\nassumed is extremely high. To operate at the required\nlevel, we must assume both that the conductivity is not\nsuppressed below the Spitzer value, and that the effective\ntemperature gradient is steeper than T \u221d r2.5 in the region of the cooling radius. Note that the Spitzer formula\nfor thermal conductivity in an ionized plasma breaks down\nif the conductivity becomes too high, i.e. if the conduction \"saturates\" as described by Cowie & McKee (1977).\nThe models shown in this paper do not take account of\nthis saturation limit. However, using the estimate of the\nsaturated heat flux from Cowie & McKee (1977), we have\nchecked that our results are not significantly affected by\nsaturation (for model 7.3, which has the most extreme conduction of all our models, there is only a small increase in\nthe number of the very brightest galaxies).\nIn Models 7.1 and 7.2, we show the effect of assuming\na more modest conduction efficiency (\u03b1cond = 1.0 and 0.1\n\n\f8\n\nBenson et al.\n\nrespectively). In these models, conduction is not sufficient\nto suppress cooling in the larger halos adequately.\nIf we adopt a lower value for \u03c38 , however, a lower conduction efficiency gives a reasonable match to the observed\nluminosity function. Model 7.4 shows the luminosity function for the case \u03c38 = 0.7 and \u03b1cond = 7. This conduction\nefficiency could be achieved if the temperature gradient\nwas T \u221d r1.3 and the conduction was only slightly suppressed below the Spitzer value. Although this is still a\nhigh rate of conduction, it offers a promising route for explaining the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.\n\nFig. 5.- Model 8. These models illustrate the effect of superwinds. In Model 8.1, an energy of \u01ebsw = 0.27 drives a weak superwind (with \u03b2SW = 3); disk reheating has efficiency \u01ebreheat = 0.13\nand there is no heating of the diffuse halo (\u01ebhalo = 0). A much\nmore powerful wind is needed to create a break in the luminosity\nfunction. Model 8.2 (\u01ebsw = 5.0; \u03b2SW = 1) illustrates the effect of\nincreasing the superwind power. An improved match to the luminosity function can be achieved with the same power if \u03c38 is lower.\nModel 8.3 shows a model with \u01ebsw = 5.0, \u03b2SW = 1 and \u03c38 = 0.7.\n\n3.7. Model with superwinds\nThe expulsion of gas from halos at high energy can, in\nprinciple, strongly suppress the formation of later generations of galaxies, hence affecting the shape of the luminosity function. Starting from Model 5.2, we add further\nfeedback energy that expels cold gas completely, not only\nfrom the disk but also from the halo. The superwind must\nhave high energy in order that the expelled material not\nbe recaptured by more massive halos. The effect of a low\npower superwind is illustrated by Model 8.1 (dashed line\nin Fig. 5). This model, with \u01ebsw = 0.27 and \u03b2SW = 3, has\na relatively weak superwind. This gas expulsion is in addition to the reheating of cold disk gas (\u01ebreheat = 0.13); we\nhave assumed that there is no heating of the diffuse halo\n(\u01ebhalo = 0.0). Although the winds eject a large amount\nof gas, most of the material is recaptured as larger halos collapse and the luminosity function differs little from\nModel 5.2.\nIn Model 8.2 (dotted line), we have set \u01ebsw = 5.0 and\n\n\u03b2SW = 1, corresponding to a mean energy per superwind\nparticle of Eav = 15keV. Such an energetic wind is required to ensure that very little material is recaptured by\ngroup halos. In this model, the superwind dominates the\nfeedback energy budget; indeed, the total energy required\n\u22121\n(5.13 \u00d7 1049 erg M\u2299\n) significantly exceeds that available\nfrom supernovae alone. The model comes much closer to\nmatching the luminosity function, but still overproduces\nbright galaxies. We can increase the superwind energy\nfurther, but a factor of 2 increase only results in a small\nimprovement in the luminosity function. If we include\nconduction as well as superwinds, it is, of course, possible to improve the match but a high conduction efficiency\n(\u03b1cond \u226b 1) is still needed. Increasing the mass loading of\nthe wind substantially (by increasing \u03b2SW ) results in too\nfew galaxies around the knee of the luminosity function.\nAs we found in the case of conduction, the luminosity\nfunction can be matched more easily if we adopt a lower\nvalue for \u03c38 . The case \u01ebsw = 5.0, \u03b2SW = 1, \u03c38 = 0.7 is\nillustrated by Model 8.3 (solid line). Given the uncertainties of our recapture prescription, this model gives a reasonable match to the luminosity function; it has a strong\nbreak at the correct luminosity, and overproduces bright\nobjects only marginally. There are a variety of ways to\nfurther improve the match to observations: we could increase the energy injection (but \u01ebsw > 10.0 is required) or\nincrease the mass loading of the wind so that the curve is\nshifted faintwards. An alternative strategy is to allow for a\nlow level of conduction: \u03b1cond \u223c 1 is sufficient to produce\na significant improvement in the match to the luminosity\nfunction when \u03c38 = 0.7 and superwinds are present.\nThe parameters \u03b1cond and \u01ebSW are highly degenerate\nin their effects on the luminosity function (i.e. increasing\neither suppresses the bright end). While current computational limitations make it prohibitively expensive to perform an accurate \u03c72 fit of the model parameters to the\ndata, a crude estimate of the \u03c72 surface for these two parameters shows that the data prefer models with strong\nsuperwinds (\u01ebSW \u2248 6) and high conductivity (\u03b1cond \u2248 30)\nfor a model with \u03c38 = 0.93. Lowering \u03c38 to 0.7 reduces the\nrequirements to \u01ebSW \u2248 3 and \u03b1cond \u2248 25. Further investigation of the \u03c72 surface would require a Bayesian prior\nto specify formally a physically allowed range for this parameter.\n3.8. Other Considerations\nWhile our primary goal in this paper is to examine\nthe luminosity function of galaxies, it is prudent to check\nwhether our models are in reasonable agreement with\nother basic properties of the galaxy population such as\nthe Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy autocorrelation\nfunction. We compare the models that best fit the galaxy\nluminosity function to these observables. We retain the\nmodel parameters found earlier and we do not attempt to\nadjust these or any other parameters in this comparison.\nWe defer a more detailed comparison of our models with a\nwider range of observational constraints to a future paper.\n3.8.1. Tully-Fisher Relation\nSimultaneously matching the galaxy luminosity function and the Tully-Fisher relation has been a long-standing\nproblem for CDM-based semi-analytic models (see, for ex-\n\n\fWhat Shapes the Luminosity Function of Galaxies?\nample, White & Frenk 1991, Kauffmann, White & Guiderdoni 1993 and Cole et al. 2000). In particular, Cole et al.\n(2000) found that while their best model reproduced the\nobserved slope and scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation, the\npredicted circular velocities for galaxy disks were about\n30% larger than the values measured for the data.\nFigure 6 shows the Tully-Fisher relation predicted by\nfour of our models (including those which most successfully\nmatch the observed luminosity function). It is readily apparent that our models all perform reasonably well in that\nthey reproduce the slope and scatter of the observed relation, although they do not match the zero-point exactly.\nModel 8.3 does best, being offset by only approximately\n10% in circular velocity over most of the range shown.\nThis model, in fact, performs rather better than that of\nCole et al. (2000), although an even better match would\nbe desirable. This may involve revising the assumption of\nadiabatic invariance made in calculating the effects of the\ndisk on the inner structure of the dark matter halo (see\nCole et al. 2000) or considering the effects of the angular\nmomentum of the superwind material or the details of our\nstar formation prescription.\n\n9\n\nthe number of galaxies that occupy dark matter halos of\na given mass. We show, in Fig. 7, the mean number of\ngalaxies brighter than MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221219.5 per halo as a\nfunction of halo mass for four of our models. For reference\nwe also plot the fits obtained by Berlind et al. (2003) to the\nsemi-anaytic model of Cole et al. (2000) and to a smoothparticle hydrodynamics calculation of galaxy formation as\nsolid and dotted lines respectively. The two models considered by Berlind et al. (2003) both gave reasonable fits\nto the galaxy correlation function.\n\nFig. 7.- Symbols show the mean number of galaxies brighter\nthan MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221219.5 as a function of halo mass for some of\nour models. For reference, lines show the fitting functions of Berlind\net al. (2003). The solid line shows their fit to the results of the Cole\net al. (2000) semi-analytic model while the dotted line shows their\nfit to a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics calculation.\n\nFig. 6.- The I-band Tully-Fisher relation of galaxies. Circles\nshow the observational sample of Mathewson, Ford & Buchhorn\n(1992). Lines show the median relation for model galaxies. We\nfollow Cole et al. (2000) and select only galaxies with a bulge-tototal ratio in dust-extinguished I-band light between 0.02 and 0.24\nand with a disk gas fraction of at least 10%. Circular velocities for\nmodel galaxies are computed at the disk half-mass radius. Errorbars\nenclose the inner 80% of the distribution of model galaxies.\n\n3.8.2. Galaxy Correlation Function\nOne of the most remarkable successes of semi-analytic\nmodels of galaxy formation in the \u039bCDM cosmology is\ntheir ability to match the observed galaxy autocorrelation function (Kauffmann et al. 1999; Benson et al. 2000).\nAs pointed out by Benson et al. (2000), the clustering of\ngalaxies may be understood physically by reference to the\nhalo occupation distribution (see, for example, Peacock\n& Smith 2000, Cooray & Sheth 2002), which specifies\n\nOur new models give rise to a mean halo occupancy\nwhich is qualitatively similar to those found by Berlind\net al. (2003) \u2013 a power-law at high masses, which flattens\nbefore cutting off sharply at some critical mass. Quantitatively, the models with conduction (7.3 and 7.4) produce\nsignificantly fewer galaxies in low and high mass halos,\nwhile agreeing with the Berlind et al. (2003) fits at a halo\nmass of a few times 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 . The models with superwinds (8.1 and 8.3) agree more closely with the Berlind\net al. (2003) fits, although model 8.3 produces somewhat\nfewer galaxies in clusters. Since none of our models differ greatly from those of Berlind et al. (2003), we may\nexpect them also to produce correlation functions in reasonable agreement with the observational data, at least\non intermediate and large scales. On smaller scales, the\nmean number of galaxies per halo is not sufficient to specify the correlation function; this requires knowledge of the\ndistribution of galaxy pairs per halo.\n\n\f10\n\nBenson et al.\n\nFig. 8.- The galaxy real-space two-point correlation function.\nCircles show the observational determination of Baugh (1996). The\nheavy solid line shows the correlation function of dark matter for\nour adopted \u039bCDM cosmology (with \u03c38 = 0.9). The remaining lines\nshow results for model galaxies brighter than MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221219.5,\nas indicated in the legend.\n\nFigure 8 shows correlation functions (computed using\nthe techniques of Benson et al. 2000) for the same four\nmodels, compared to both the predicted dark matter correlation function and the observed galaxy correlation function. As expected, all models do well at matching the\ndata on scales larger than about 1h\u22121 Mpc. On smaller\nscales, all models are 'antibiassed' with respect to the\ndark matter, but they produce somewhat too much clustering. Benson et al. (2000) found similar results for their\nsemi-analytic model. Model 8.3 gives, in fact, very similar clustering results to theirs (for the same \u039bCDM cosmology). The other models produce even stronger correlations on small scales, providing a worse match to the data.\nModel 8.3 does better than Model 8.2 because it places\nrelatively fewer galaxies in clusters, thereby having many\nfewer pairs on small scales. We speculate that a model\nwhich performs even better at matching the observed luminosity function (e.g. producing a sharper cut-off at bright\nmagnitudes) may also do even better at matching the observed correlation function.\n4. discussion\n\nWe have examined the key physics thought to be necessary to explain the shape of the galaxy luminosity function\nin a cold dark matter universe. While the cooling and condensation of gas in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos remains the fundamental process through which galaxies form, we have demonstrated that at least two other\nprocesses must act to shape the luminosity function. A\nminimal model requires the inclusion of feedback mechanism(s) (beyond the heating resulting from the photoionization of the pregalactic gas) to flatten the faint end of the\nluminosity function and to suppress cooling at the centres\nof the massive halos of groups and clusters. If a fraction of\n\nthe energy liberated by supernovae and winds goes into reheating disk gas and/or heating the diffuse gas halo, then\nthe formation of faint galaxies is suppressed, resulting in\na flattened faint-end slope that matches the available observational data adequately. These mechanisms on their\nown, however, are unable to produce a sharp cut-off at\nthe bright end of the luminosity function. We have shown\nthat there are two possible (but quite extreme) processes\nthat can achieve this: (1) thermal conduction at about\nor above the Spitzer rate; (2) expulsion of gas from halos\nin superwinds at temperatures high enough to prevent its\nsubsequent recapture.\nThe high value of \u03b1cond required to suppress the bright\nend of the luminosity function is discouraging since it\nimplies both that the conductivity must be close to the\nSpitzer value (despite the presence of \u03bcG magnetic fields\nin clusters; Narayan & Medvedev 2001; Taylor et al. 2002),\nand that the effective temperature gradient must be somewhat steeper than the gradients observed in galaxy clusters\n(Allen et al. 2001; Fabian, Voigt & Morris 2002).\nHowever, our method for calculating the effect of conduction is highly simplified. In particular, there are two\nissues that are not well addressed. Firstly, our calculation is based on the heat flux through a shell. We have\nnot considered the total extent of the region in which\nconduction must be effective. We can define a radius\nrout , such that the initial thermal energy in the region\nrcool < r < rout is equal to the total energy radiated from\nthe region r < rcool , where rcool is the cooling radius in\nthe presence of conduction. Thermal energy needs to be\nconducted from a radius at least as large as rout in order to balance the radiative losses from smaller radii. For\nan isothermal halo with an r\u22122 density profile, we find\n\u20322\n\u2032\nrcool rout = rcool\n, where rcool\nis the cooling radius calculated in the absence of conduction. The radius rout can\nbe large, but the temperature gradient that is required to\ntransport heat effectively across this region is a strongly\ndeclining function of radius. Thus, so long as rout lies\nwithin the virialized region of the cluster, this is unlikely\nto modify our solution significantly. Secondly, our method\nassumes that the logarithmic temperature gradient within\nrcool is constant. If, instead, the gradient is peaked in\nthis region, our method would underestimate the heat deposited in the shell at rcool . These two simplifications\n(which affect the required conduction coefficient in opposite senses) are difficult to model accurately and without\nad-hoc assumptions. Clearly, this is a problem that needs\nto be addressed by numerical simulations of cooling in conductive plasmas. These would allow us to calibrate our\nsimple model of conductive heating and to infer what conductivity is required, by removing the degeneracy between\nthe shape of the halo temperature profile and the suppression factor fsp for the conductivity.\nThe alternative model invokes highly energetic \"superwind\" outflows. The expulsion of gas from the halo reduces\nthe reservoir of baryons available for cooling at later times,\nand reduces the number of stars formed by each parcel of\ncold gas. However, the fraction of baryons required to be\nin this \"super-heated\" phase at z = 0 is quite high, and\nthe energy budget is exceptional. We found the energy\nbudget of a promising superwind model to be in region of\n5 \u00d7 1049 ergs per Solar mass of stars formed. It is quite\n\n\fWhat Shapes the Luminosity Function of Galaxies?\npossible our model may not treat the recapture process\nadequately and that we may therefore be overestimating\nthe total energy requirement. It is difficult to model the\nprocess better, however, because the expelled gas may cool\nadiabatically and then be accreted by a completely different halo; alternatively, some material may escape into void\nregions and evade recapture altogether. A further problem is the need to assume a particular distribution for the\nwind particle energies. Our assumption that the distribution is thermal may lead us to overestimate the energy\nrequirement.\nOn average, the mass of baryons ejected from halos\namounts to 7% of mean cosmic value. This corresponds to\nabout 1.3 times the fraction of baryons turned into stars.\nA compilation of observations by Martin (1999) suggests\nthat the total mass loss rate from disk galaxies could certainly be as high as twice the star formation rate. If all of\nthis mass loss were energetic enough to produce a superwind, these observations would provide some justification\nfor the high value of \u01ebsw required in our model. The total\nenergy budget, however, exceeds that available from su\u22121\npernovae (\u223c 0.9 \u00d7 1049 erg M\u2299\nfor the Kennicutt IMF)\neven though we have not allowed for radiative losses. Although the exact energy output from supernovae is uncertain, and the conditions we have assumed for superwind\nescape are also uncertain, this suggests that the supernova\nenergy must need to be supplemented by energy released\nduring black hole formation (Ensslin et al. 1998; Bower et\nal. 2001; Cavaliere et al. 2002).\nFinally, we have briefly examined the ability of some of\nour most successful models to match the observed TullyFisher relation and galaxy correlation function. Without adjusting any parameters, we find, as in many previous semi-analytic calculations, that our models adequately\nmatch the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation,\nbut tend to overpredict the circular velocity at a given luminosity (or, equivalently, underpredict the luminosity at\ngiven circular velocity.) In most cases, the agreement is\nat least as good as in previous studies, but for one of our\nsuperwind models the discrepancy in the circular velocity\nzero-point is reduced to only 10%. At least one of our mod-\n\n11\n\nels (Model 8.3) matches the galaxy autocorrelation function reasonably well (as well as the semi-analytic model\nof Benson et al. (2000)). Importantly, this success reflects\nthe fact that clusters in this model contain relatively fewer\ngalaxies, and thus many fewer pairs on small scales, than\nclusters in other models. This demonstrates how measurements of galaxy clustering place important constraints\non halo mass-dependent feedback processes such as those\nconsidered in this study. Our results encourage a more detailed investigation of how our models fare when compared\nwith a wider range of observables, a programme that we\nintend to pursue in future work.\n5. conclusions\n\nOne of the simplest properties of the galaxy population,\nthe luminosity function, is now reasonably well determined\nobservationally (although, as we have noted, some significant disagreements about the faint-end slope remain).\nWe have shown that our theoretical understanding of this\nfundamental property has progressed enormously in recent years to the extent that it is now possible to explain\nthe form of the luminosity function in quantitative detail. Nevertheless, two crucial ingredients-feedback and\nconduction-are understood only poorly at best. Further\nstudy of these physical processes is required before we can\ntruly claim a satisfactory understanding of the luminosity\nfunction of galaxies.\nacknowledgments\nWe thank J.-S.

For the material which escapes the halo, the mean energy excess over that\nneeded to eject it from the halo is\n\u001eZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nEesc = Eav\n(x \u2212 xSW ) exp(\u2212x)dx\nexp(\u2212x)dx = Eav ,\n(A2)\nxSW\n\nxSW\n\ni.e. the mean (kinetic+thermal) energy per unit mass for the gas escaping from the halo is the same as the mean\n(kinetic+thermal) energy per unit mass for the gas flowing out of the disk (since only the highest energy particles escape).\nUsing therefore the same energy distribution, we assume that the fraction of particles recaptured in a halo of virial velocity\nVhalo is\nZ xcap\nexp(\u2212x)dx = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212xcap )\n(A3)\nfcap =\n0\n\nwhere xcap =\n\n2\nCcap Vhalo\n/Eav ,\n\nand Ccap is a numerical coefficient of order unity.
