We accomplish this by relating the\npartition function of dual giant gravitons to the Hilbert series for mesonic operators\nin the CFT.

These curvature invariants contribute to the 1/N 2 corrections of the\ndifference of the 4D anomaly coefficients a and c recently found by Liu and Minasian,\nwhich we now have a purely field theoretic method of calculating.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing the discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [1], the duality was\ngeneralized to compactifications of the form AdS5 \u00d7 L5 , where L5 is an arbitrary SasakiEinstein manifold [2, 3]. The Sasaki-Einstein condition ensures that the low energy supergravity theory on L5 preserves 8 supercharges. This supersymmetry condition has a\ngeometric interpretation, that the cone X 6 over L5 is a Calabi-Yau singularity. The dual\nfield theory is obtained from the low-energy field theory on the world-volume of N D3-branes\nplaced at the Calabi-Yau singularity. By studying fluctuations on the string theory side one\nfinds that information about the L5 factor must be encoded in the particle content and spectrum for the dual CFT. This motivates one to ask, paralleling the iconic question in spectral\ntheory [4], \"is it possible to hear the shape of a dual geometry?\"\nIn fact, the analogy to the classic question of Kac in spectral theory is remarkably close,\nas we make use of the Hilbert series, a holomorphic analog of the heat kernel. Generalizing\nthe works of Martelli, Sparks and Yau [5, 6, 7], we relate curvature invariants of L5 to the\nnumber of mesonic operators in the CFT by counting the asymptotic number of holomorphic\nfunctions on the Calabi-Yau cone over L5 . By computing sub-leading 1/N 2R corrections to\nthe asymptotic number of long mesonic operators, we are able to compute L5 Riem2 from\npurely CFT data without reference to an explicit metric on L5 .\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence predicts that the volume of the horizon manifold is inversely relate to the a-central charge of the dual gauge theory\nV ol(L5 ) =\n\n\u03c03N 2\n.\n4a\n\nRecently this piece of the AdS/CFT conjecture was mathematically proven [8] by analyzing\nthe leading order behavior of the Hilbert series. The sub-leading coefficients of the Hilbert\nseries contain a wealth of geometric information as well. The main result of this paper is the\nfollowing relation between the coefficients of the singular terms in the Hilbert series of the\nquiver gauge theory and curvature invariants of L5\n\u0012 \u00133\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03b2 \u0124\nTrH e\n\u221d lim\nH0,0 (Q, e\u2212s )\ns\u21920\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n91\nvol(L5 ) vol(L5 )\n2\n5\n5\nRiem\n(L\n)\n+\n+\nvol(L\n)\n+\n+ O(1)\n(1.1)\n=\ns3\ns2\n216\n1728 L5\ns\n\nThis is also an asymptotic expansion of the quantum partition function for dual giant gravitons. We are able to prove this when L5 is a regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold (that is when\nit is the total space of a regular U(1) bundle over a 4d K\u00e4hler-Einstein base B 4 ). Our proof\nuses the Tian-Yau-Zelditch (TYZ) expansion of the heat kernel [9, 10, 11, 12] which relates\nthe Hilbert series to the curvatures of the 4d base and then we \"undo\" the Kaluza-Klein\nreduction to rewrite this in terms of the 5d total space. For several irregular Sasaki-Einstein\nmanifolds where an explicit metric is known [13] we have verified by direct calculation that\n1\n\n\f(1.1) also holds. We therefore conjecture that (1.1) holds not only for L5 regular SasakiEinstein, but for quasi-regular and irregular Sasaki-Einstein manifolds as well.\nThe physics motivating our proof is as follows. First, we believe from AdS/CFT that\nthe partition functions for dual giant gravitons is the Hilbert series for the quiver gauge\ntheory. Indeed, Martelli and Sparks showed that BPS dual giant gravitons act as point\nparticles in time \u00d7 L5 [7]. It is clear that a point particle moving on L5 can be KaluzaKlein reduced to an electrically charged point particle moving in an electromagnetic field in\nB 4 . This scenario was analyzed by Douglas and Klevtsov [14] and they re-derived the TYZ\nexpansion of the partition function for a particle in a magnetic field. Therefore the problem\nof counting mesonic operators in the CFT is reduced to counting the number of states in\nthe lowest Landau level in the base space B 4 . Douglas and Klevtsov relate the expansion\nof the Landau level counting to curvature invariants on the base space B 4 . However, the\nrequirement that L5 be Sasaki-Einstein and that B 4 be at least locally K\u00e4hler-Einstein with\na U(1) line bundle is a strong enough condition that it fixes a relationship between 4d and\n5d curvature invariants. Since in both the regular and irregular cases, L5 is smooth, we\nconjecture that the expansion written in 5d curvatures also holds in the irregular case.\nThe outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the Hilbert series\nand the correspondence between mesonic operators and holomorphic functions on the CalabiYau cone. Section 3 reviews the results of Martelli and Sparks [7], which relates the Hilbert\nseries to the partition function of dual giant gravitons. We then connect their partition\nfunction to that of the integer quantum hall system studied by Douglas and Klevtsov [14].\nIn section 4 we express the sub-leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Hilbert\nseries as geometric invariants, provide a proof of the conjectured form for regular SasakiEinstein manifolds, and provide evidence that the result holds more generally for quasiregular and irregular Sasaki-Einstein manifolds as well. Finally, we conclude in section 5\nwith more general remarks and avenues for future research. We also include an appendix\nwhich provides further details omitted from the main body of the paper.\nAs this work was nearing publication, we became aware of the work of Liu and Minasian\n[15] which computes contributions to 1/N 2 corrections to the anomaly coefficients a and c\nof the dual field theory. Such corrections correspond to higher curvature terms in the AdS\ngravitational action, which reduce to integrated curvature invariants in the expansion, an\ninterpretation complementary to the work presented in this paper. Our work provides a\nmethod of calculating these curvature invariants from purely field theoretic data.\n\n2\n\nThe Hilbert series\n\nIn this section we consider N = 1 supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) obtained from a stack of N D3-branes at a Calabi-Yau singularity X 6 . For toric Calabi-Yau\n3-folds, mesonic operators in the gauge theory are in one-to-one correspondence with holomorphic functions on the Calabi-Yau manifold [16, 17, 7]. For general N = 1 superconformal\nquiver gauge theories we can identify mesonic operators based at a U(N) gauge group with\n2\n\n\fholomorphic functions on the Calabi-Yau manifold [8].\nWe consider local Calabi-Yau singularities X 6 = SpecR where R is a Gorenstein ring of\ndimension 3. A broad class of such singularities can be described by quiver gauge theories\nwith superpotential algebras A of the form\nA = EndR (R + M1 + * * * + Mn )\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere Mi are R-modules corresponding to fractional branes. Since EndR (R) = R, it is\npossible to identify closed loops based at the node corresponding to R with the elements of\nthe ring R. These loops are the holomorphic functions on the Calabi-Yau singularity X 6 ,\nand thus the based mesonic operators in the CFT are in one-to-one correspondence with\nholomorphic functions on the Calabi-Yau 3-fold.\nThe Hilbert series of a quiver gauge theory is defined to be\nX\nH(t) =\ntR(O)\nO\u2208 Mesons\n\nwhere the sum extends over all mesonic operators O based at a U(N) gauge group up to Fterm equivalence. For a superconformal quiver gauge theory, we define an adjacency matrix\ngraded by R-charge,\nX\nM(Q; t)ij =\ntR(e) ,\n(2.2)\ne\u2208Arrows(i\u2192j)\n\nwhere R(e) is a trial R-charge assignment for the edge e. A trial R-charge is an R-charge\nassignment such that the quiver gauge theory has vanishing beta functions and is hence\nsuperconformal. The true R-charge assignment in the infrared is determined by the Amaximization procedure of Intriligator and Wecht [18]. The Hilbert series of the superconformal quiver gauge theory is the (0, 0) component of the matrix [8]\nH(Q; t) =\n\n1\n1 \u2212 MQ (t) + t2 MQT (t\u22121 ) \u2212 t2\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe now explain the Hilbert series in the context of singularities X that are the total space\nof a line bundle L \u2192 B 4 , which is the case of primary interest throughout the remainder of\nthis paper 1 . In this case, the corresponding Sasaki-Einstein manifold is regular. For such\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, the Hilbert series takes the form\nH(t, X) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=0\n\ndim H0 (B, L\u2297k )tk\n\n1\n\n(2.4)\n\nNot all Sasaki-Einstein manifolds are of this form. The base B 4 = F1 , known as the first del Pezzo\nsurface, has no K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric. The existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric in this case is obstructed\nby the Matsushima and Futaki theorems [23, 19, 25]. However the \"link\" of the total space of the anticanonical line bundle over F1 , which is called Y 2,1 , does admit a Sasaki-Einstein metric [24].\n\n3\n\n\fin this case, the TYZ asymptotic expansion of the Hilbert series is sensitive to the volume\nand curvature of the base B 4 [9, 10, 11, 15]\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\nR\n1\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nk +k +\n+ O( ) .\nRiem \u2212 Ric + R\n(2.5)\nH(t, X) = g(k) =\n2\n2\n24\n6\n8\nk\nIt is also useful to consider the restriction of C to U(1), which naturally gives L5 as a\ncircle bundle over B 4\nS 1 \u2192 L5\n\u2193\n(2.6)\n4\nB .\nAs an explicit example, consider the case X = C3 , in which case L = S 5 and B = CP2\nand the relevant line bundle is L = O(1).\ndim H0 (B, L\u2297k ) =\n\n(k + 1)(k + 2)\n.\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nComputing the Hilbert series for C3 , we find\nH(t, X) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(k + 1)(k + 2)\nk=0\n\n2\n\ntk =\n\n1\n.\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n\n(2.8)\n\nAs shown by Martelli, Sparks, and Yau [5, 6] and will be further elaborated in section\n4, the TYZ expansion determines dim H0 (B, L\u2297k ) as a quadratic polynomial ak 2 + bk + c\nwhose leading coefficient a is proportional to the volume of the horizon manifold. Similarly,\nthe linear term b is fixed by the Calabi-Yau condition, and as we will show, the constant\nterm c is determined by integrating a linear combination of quadratic curvatures over the\nhorizon manifold L.\nGiven the Hilbert series H(t) for a Calabi-Yau 3-algebra, which has a pole at t = 1, the\ncoefficients a, b, and c are easily computed from the singular part of H(e\u2212s ) near s = 0,\nlim H(e\u2212s ) =\n\ns\u21920\n\n2a\nb\nc\n+ 2 + + O(1) .\n3\ns\ns\ns\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe Hilbert series and TYZ expansion for several examples are given in table 1.\n\n3\n\nBPS states and free particles\n\nIn this section we will review how the action for dual giant gravitons can be locally viewed as\nthe action of an electrically charged particle on a K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold in the presence of\na magnetic field.

Compactifying type IIB string theory to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold\nX 6 preserves N = 2 supersymmetry in 4d. If the Calabi-Yau manifold X 6 is a real cone\nover a Sasaki-Einstein base L5 , then placing a stack of N D3-branes at a singular point in\nX 6 leads to a theory with N = 1 supersymmetry on the D3-brane world-volume. The near\nhorizon geometry is AdS5 \u00d7 L5 , where L5 is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, called the \"horizon\nmanifold.\" The AdS radial direction r combines with L5 to give a non-compact Calabi-Yau\ncone X 6 with metric\nds2X = dr 2 + r 2 ds2L .2\n(3.1)\nEvery Sasaki-Einstein manifold has a distinguished vector field\n\u03be = J(r\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n)=\n\u2202r\n\u2202\u03c8\n\ncalled the Reeb vector field.

The abelian part of the isometry group of X 6 is (C\u2217 )s where s = 1, 2 or 3.\nThe Reeb vector field can be written as a linear combination of the generators of the U(1)s\nisometry group as\nX \u2202\n\u03be=\nbi\n.\n\u2202\u03c6i\ni\n\nFor certain linear combinations of the U(1) generators, the orbits no longer close and the\nSasaki-Einstein manifold is called irregular. If the orbits close, the Sasaki-Einstein manifold\nis regular or quasi-regular.\nDual Giant Gravitons are supersymmetric configurations corresponding to D3-branes\nwrapped on S 3 \u00d7 time \u2286 AdS5 . The dynamics of BPS dual giants (the BPS condition\n2\n\nWhile we will make extensive use of the assumption that X 6 can be written as a cone over a SasakiEinstein base, it is important to note that not all non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds are of this form, and\nfor such exotic spaces that cannot be written as metric cones, it is unclear how to formulate the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence [20].\n\n5\n\n\ffixes the brane's radial position as well as it's position in B 4 ) is equivalent to that of BPS\npoint-particles on L5 with Hamiltonian\n1\nHBP S = P\u03c8\nl\nwhere l is the AdS5 radius\nl = 4\u03c0gs N\u03b1\u20322 ,\nand P\u03c8 is the momentum conjugate to \u03c8. The phase space for BPS dual giant gravitons\nis (X 6 , ds2X ). Using geometric quantization, Martelli and Sparks [7] quantize the classical\nphase space, to obtain the quantum Hamiltonian, \u0124, for a BPS point-particle. The partition\nfunction dual giant gravitons is\nZquantum (\u03b2) = TrH e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere the trace is over all states in the Hilbert space H. Martelli and Sparks show that the\nspace of states is precisely the space of holomorphic functions on XQ6 and that the eigenvalues\nof the holomorphic functions under the (C\u2217 )s action are qm = si=1 qimi . They then write\nthe partition function as\nTrH e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124 \u223c\n(3.3)\n= C(qi = e\u2212\u03b2\u03bei /l , X 6 ) .\nwhere the equivariant character C(q, X 6 ) is the Hilbert series of X 6 .\nBecause the BPS condition fixes the radial position and the position on the K\u00e4hlerEinstein base, and the Hamiltonian restricted to BPS geodesics given by the Dirac-BornInfeld and Wess-Zumino terms is precisely that corresponding to a BPS point particle moving\nin L5 [7]. Any Sasakian metric can be written locally in the form\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n2\n2\ndsL = dsB +\nd\u03c8 + A\n(3.4)\n3\nwhere ds2B is locally a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric.

Indeed [7] shows an identification between the BPS dual giant graviton phase space and\nthat of the geodesics studied above. This action can be dimensionally reduced to that of a\ncharged particle in an electric field, which is studied by Douglas and Klevtsov in [14]. This\nis motivated by the result from Kaluza-Klein theory [21], given a 5d metric with a U(1)\nisometry,\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n2\ni\nj\n2\nd\u03c8 + A\n,\n(3.12)\nds = hij dx dx + \u03c6\n3\n\np\u03c8 is constant and the geodesic equation reduces to\n\u1e8di + \u0393ijk \u1e8bj \u1e8bk \u2212\n\nq i j\nF \u1e8b = 0 .\nm j\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe connection of the bundle is proportional to the base K\u00e4hler form (when L5 is quasiregular or irregular, this is true away from fixed points), so it is like a magnetic field,\nF \u223c Bxy dx \u2227 dy + Bzw dz \u2227 dw, as in the work of Douglas and Klevtsov. Indeed, the usual\nrules of Kaluza-Klein reduction allow us to start with (3.6), restrict to BPS states, gauge fix\nthe re-parametrization invariance by choosing t = \u03c4 , fix a holomorphic gauge choice for A,\nand add an overall constant shift, which reduces the action to\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nSBPS,fixed = dt \u22121 + hi\uf6be\u0304 \u1e8bi x\u0304 \u0307 \uf6be\u0304 + Ai \u1e8bi + \u0100\uf6be\u0304 x\u0304 \u0307 \uf6be\u0304 ,\n(3.14)\nprecisely the action Douglas and Klevtsov study in [14].\n\n4\n\nThe proof and a conjecture\n\nIn [7], Martelli and Sparks relate the quantum partition function of free BPS particles moving\non the Sasaki-Einstein manifold L5 to the asymptotic number of holomorphic functions on\n7\n\n\fL5\n\nVolume\n\nS5\n\n\u03c03\n\nT 1,1\n\n16\u03c0 3\n27\n\u03c03\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012 r\n2\n\u03c0 3 q 2 2+ 4\u2212 3q2\np\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u221a\n3p 3q 2 +p \u22122p+ 4p2 \u22123q 2\n\nS 5 /Z3\nY pq\n\nR\n\nRiem2\n40\u03c0 3\n\n2176\u03c0 3\n27\n40\u03c0 3\n3\nr\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0012\n\u221a\n2\n8\u03c0 3 2p2 \u22123q 2 +p 4p2 \u22123q 2 106\u221219 4\u2212 3q2\np\n\n27(p3 \u2212pq 2 )\n\nTable 2: Volumes and integrated curvatures\nL5 . Simple dimensional analysis tells us that these terms are increasing powers of curvatures.\nThe leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Hilbert series is determined in terms of\nthe volume of L5 . If we consider the entire quadratic polynomial ak 2 + bk + c, or equivalently\nall singular terms resulting from the asymptotic expansion of the Hilbert series 2.9, we find\nan interesting result, namely, that these terms can also be expressed in terms of geometric\ncurvature invariants of L5 .\nThe first sub-leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Hilbert series, b, is fixed\nby the condition that X 6 be Calabi-Yau to be twice the leading term a; thus, b is also\nexpressible in terms of the volume of L5 [26]. Alternatively, by the Einstein condition,\nalong with our choice of conventions for the cosmological constant on L5 , there is only one\nindependent curvature invariant up to linear order in the Riemann tensor, which we choose\nto parametrize in terms of the volume. This can also be seen from the CFT data. Stanley\n[26] shows that the Hilbert series of a Gorenstein (CY) singularity is \"palindromic\" in the\nvariable t. A quick exercise shows that when you expand in the variable s after t = e\u2212s , this\nautomatically implies that the two leading coefficients are equal.\nAt the next order in the asymptotic expansion, we find that if our conjecture is to be\nconfirmed, c must be expressible as a linear combination of two independent invariants at\nquadratic order in the Riemann curvature, which we choose to parametrize by Riem2 and R2 .\n5\nFurthermore, by fixing\nR the2 cosmological constant on L 5, we may normalize R = 20, which\nallows us to express L5 R in terms of the volume of L . Thus, there are two independent\ncoefficients which we can fix by matching to S 5 and the conifold.\nAs a check of the conjecture, we compute the appropriate curvatures for a wide variety\nof Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with known metrics, including the infinite family Y p,q [13] as\nwell as several examples from the family La,b,c [22], some of which can be found in table 2.\nWe then compare to the Hilbert series computed by methods described in [8] and find the\nresults match in all cases, as is shown in table 1.\nWe prove the conjecture in the restricted case where L5 can be written as a regular\n1\nS bundle over a K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold B 4 by noting that we have related the action\nstudied by Martelli and Sparks in [7] to the action studied in [14] by Douglas and Klevtsov.\nSpecifically, from the action 3.14, Douglas computes the TYZ expansion of the partition\n8\n\n\ffunction, which we write here for the case of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\nR\n1\n1\n1\n1 2\n1\n2\n2\n2\nk +k +\n+ O( ) ,\ng(k) =\nRiem \u2212 Ric + R\n2\n2\n24\n6\n8\nk\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere we have worked in complex coordinates and followed the standard complex conventions.

The N = 1 superconformal algebra relates the scaling dimensions\nof chiral primaries to their R-charge\n2\nR(O) = \u2206(O) .\n3\nThis lets us rewrite equation 4.3 as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u00133\n1\n91\n1\nvol vol\n2\u03c0\n2\n\u2212s\nvol +\nRiem\n+ O(1) .\nHQ (e ) = 3 + 2 +\nlim\ns\u21920\n3\ns\ns\n216\n1728\ns\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\nOur proof only applies to the case where L5 is a regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold since\nit relies on the circle fibers being compact and non-degenerate. Nonetheless, we have shown\nby example that the conjecture appears to hold even in the quasi-regular case so long as the\ntotal space L5 remains smooth.\n3\n\nIn order to convert from complex to real curvature conventions, it is useful to note that there are twice\nas many real coordinates as complex coordinates, and so there is a factor of two from each trace.

While we are only able to construct\na proof for this fact in the regular case, where the U(1) fibration is compact and nondegenerate, there is significant evidence that our conjecture holds in the quasi-regular case\nas well. This is a strong indication that there should be an intrinsically 5 dimensional proof\nof the conjecture, rather than relying on the techniques of Kaluza-Klein reduction.\nR\nPurely from CFT data, we are able to compute L5 Riem2 without reference to an explicit\nmetric, relating 1/N 2 corrections to the counting of long mesonic operators in the CFT to\ncurvatures in the AdS dual. Such 1/N 2 corrections, related to the difference in the a and\nc anomalies of the N = 1 SCFT, have recently been shown to be closely related to the appearance of higher order curvature corrections in the dual gravitational action [15]. Thus, it\nshould come as no surprise that the AdS/CFT correspondence allows us to extract curvature\ninformation from such corrections. Nonetheless, given the relative scarcity of examples of the\nemergent geometry, we should attempt to fully exploit any novel constructions such as this\nto increase our knowledge. Hopefully, through careful study, it will be possible to generalize\nthis result and relate other details of the CFT to the emergence of bulk geometry.\nThere are a large number of open questions and future directions to look into. The most\nobvious one is extending our proof to the quasi-regular and irregular cases. It should be\npossible to prove a generalization of (4.1) with proper treatment of the singular points of\nthe fiber. It would also be interesting to know if there is a directly five dimensional method\nof calculating the TYZ expansion, in which case we would not have to worry about any of\nthe issues in the reduction to the K\u00e4hler-Einstein base.\nAnother question is what further geometric information is hidden in the full matrix\nH(Q; t). The full matrix appears to encode information about the baryonic spectrum of the\ngauge theory [27] and it would be interesting to relate this to the emergent geometry.\nA third question is how such heat kernel expansions carry over to compactifications using\ngeneralized geometry. Given that it was recently shown that the volume-minimization/amaximization story translates [28], it would be interesting to study what generalized curvature invariants appear in subleading terms in the heat kernel expansion.\nLastly, we have studied 1/N 2 corrections to the CFT which are hiding nontrivial geometric information about the gravity side. Is there geometric information hidden in 1/\u03bb\ncorrections as well? Given that such \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the supergravity theory include higher\ncurvature corrections, these must be related. It would be very interesting to connect these\nto the related work in [15].\n\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank D. Berenstein, M.R. Douglas, and D.R.

To obtain a total space X 6 which is\nCalabi-Yau, we require the base space L5 to be Einstein [2, 3], e.g.\nRab = 4gab ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere we fix the 5d Einstein coefficient to be 4 by convention (we will use a, b, . . . to denote\nindices along L5 ).\nWe also know that such an Einstein manifold L5 must have a U(1) isometry and therefore\nis Sasakian. Thus L5 may always be written as a principal S 1 bundle \u03c0 : L5 \u2192 B 4 over\na K\u00e4hler-Einstein base with a connection 1-form \u03b7 [5, 6]. The bundle structure allows the\nmetric on L5 to be locally written in the form\n\u0001\n(5)\ng = \u03c0 \u2217 (4)h + \u03c62 \u03b7 \u2297 \u03b7 .\n(A.2)\n\nMaking contact with the language of Kaluza-Klein compactifications, \u03c6 plays the role of the\ndilaton field, while the connection 1-form \u03b7 = 31 d\u03c8 + A, where A is a U(1) gauge field on the\nbase B and \u03c8 is a coordinate on the circle fiber. In order for both B and M to satisfy the\nEinstein condition, \u03c6 must satisfy the equation (4)\u0003 \u03c6 = const. However, the only smooth\nsolutions to this equation for compact B are constant \u03c6, and thus we may henceforth restrict\nourselves to the case of constant dilaton field \u03c6 = 1/2.\nSince the structure group U(1) is abelian,\nd\u03b7 = \u0393\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the curvature form of \u03b7. In physicist's terms\n1\nd\u03b7 = d2 \u03c8 + dA = dA\n3\nso we can write\n\u0393 = \u03c0\u2217\n\nX\ni,j\n\nFij \u03b8i \u2227 \u03b8j\n\n!\n\n(A.4)\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere Fij = \u2212Fji is the curvature of the U(1) bundle on the base and \u03b8i form an orthonormal basis of 1-forms on B. (Above and throughout what follows, we will use roman indices\ni, j, . . . to denote directions on the base and \u03c8 to denote directions along the circle fiber.)\nFurthermore, it will be essential for the computations that follow that we work in an orthonormal frame, since then on the bundle, covariant derivatives in bundle directions are\nequivalent to covariant derivatives on the base.\nProposition A.1. The Riemann curvature tensor on L can be expressed as the curvature\n\n12\n\n\ftensor of the base B and the curvature of the U(1) connections as\n(5)\n\nR ijkl = (4)R ijkl \u2212 \u03c62 (2Fij Fkl + Fik Fjl \u2212 Fil Fjk )\n!\nX\n(5)\n2\nFil Fkl\nR i\u03c8k\u03c8 = \u03c6\n\n(A.7)\n\n\u2207l Fik \u2212 \u2207k Fil = \u2212\u2207i Fkl\n\n(A.9)\n\n(A.6)\n\nl\n\n(5)\n\nR i\u03c8kl = \u03c6 (\u2207l Fik \u2212 \u2207k Fil ) = \u2212\u03c6\u2207i Fkl\n\n(A.8)\n\nThe identity\nfollows from\n\nP\n\nij\n\nFij \u03b8i \u2227 \u03b8j being closed.\n\nProposition A.2.

By the Einstein condition,\nat second order in curvature there are only two independent quantities, which we choose to\nexpress in terms of the volume and Riem2 . By our normalization convention for \u03c6, which\nfixes \u03c8 to have period 2\u03c0, (5)Vol = 2\u03c0 (4)Vol . Furthermore, since the Maxwell tensor is\nproportional to the complex structure on B, we will be able to express (5)Riem2 purely in\nterms of (4)Riem2 and (4)Vol .\nBefore we continue with the computation, it is worth reminding ourselves of a few useful\nfacts. First, recall the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, namely\nRijkl = \u2212Rijlk = \u2212Rjikl = Rklij\n\n(A.13)\n\nalong with the Bianchi identity\nRijkl + Riklj + Riljk = 0 .\n\n(A.14)\n\nGiven our convention that (4)R ij = 6hij , (4)R = 24. Also recall that the complex structure\nJij is antisymmetric and J 2 = \u22121. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, in the case we are\nconsidering\n(5)\nR i\u03c8kl = \u2212\u03c6\u2207i Fkl = \u22122\u03c6\u2207i Jkl = 0 ,\n(A.15)\nsince the condition \u2207i Jkl = 0 is simply the integrability condition for the complex structure\non the base, making the base a K\u00e4hler manifold. Finally, the compatibility of the complex\n\n13\n\n\fstructure with the covariant derivative on the base also allows us to derive one final identity,\n(4)\n\nR ijkl J il J jk =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nh((4)R (\u2202k , \u2202l )\u2202i , \u2202j )J il J jk\nh(J il (4)R (\u2202k , \u2202l )\u2202i , J jk \u2202j )\nh((4)R (\u2202k , \u2202l )J il \u2202i , J jk \u2202j )\nh((4)R (\u2202k , \u2202l )\u2202i , \u2202j )\n\u2212(4)R .\n\nArmed with these facts, we are now prepared to proceed with our computation.\n\u0011\n\u0010\nijkl\ni\u03c8k\u03c8\n(5)\nRiem2 = (5)R ijkl (5)R\n+ 4 (5)R i\u03c8k\u03c8 (5)R\n\u00012\n= (4)R ijkl \u2212 \u03c62 (2Fij Fkl + Fik Fjl \u2212 Fil Fjk ) + 4\u03c62 Fik F ik\nRiem2 \u2212 8\u03c62(4)R ijkl (2Jij Jkl + Jik Jjl \u2212 Jil Jjk )\n+16\u03c64 (2Jij Jkl + Jik Jjl \u2212 Jil Jjk )2 + 16\u03c62 Jik J ik\n\n(4)\n\n=\n\n= (4)Riem2 \u2212 2(6 (4)R ) + 120 + 16\n= (4)Riem2 \u2212 152 .\n\nWhile this equality is purely geometric and holds locally, our conjecture arises from the\nCFT dual and depends on integrated quantities.
