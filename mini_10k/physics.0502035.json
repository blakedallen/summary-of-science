Tiwari\nInstitute of Natural Philosophy\n1 Kusum Kutir, Mahamanapuri\nVaranasi 221005, India\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dark energy problem may have a simple solution in the model of cosmology\nbased on the space-time interaction hypothesis. The hypothesis throws light on the nature of\ntime (see Time-Transcendence-Truth, to be published).\n\n1\n\n\fRamifications of recent observations on the anisotropy and fluctuations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) radiation, and magnitude versus redshift of type Ia\nSupernovae (SNIa) on the history of cosmic evolution from the moment of big-bang creation\nare being intensely explored. These observations strongly suggest a flat universe at large\nscales in the standard model of cosmology based on general relativity (GR). Accelerating\nexpansion of the universe is also indicated. For vanishing large scale curvature, the total\naverage energy density in the universe has to be close to the critical density, \u03c1o (~ 10-29\ngm/cm3). Estimated mean mass density from the astronomical observations is, however less\nthan 50% of this value. Note that this estimate refers to baryonic matter and radiations\nincluding neutrinos. Even finite non-zero mass of neutrinos changes this value marginally.\nWe do not know what kind of 95% of the energy in universe is though it has been proposed\nthat 25% of \u03c1o is in the form of dark matter (DM) and rest is dark energy. Interestingly as\nearly as 1937 Zwicky had anticipated DM content, and later on cold DM models for the\nstructure of galaxies and clusters of galaxies were extensively studied. Temperature\nfluctuations in the CMB data show that \u03a9DM ~ 0.25 \u2013 0.30. where \u03a9DM = \u03c1DM/\u03c1o.\nAstrophysicists favor cold DM models, and recent X-ray observations [1] seem to be\nconsistent with them. The best fits to the data in Hubble diagrams for SNIa are obtained for\nthe mass density that implies that galaxies are moving away from each other at an accelerating\nrate [2]. Constraints on dark energy and its equation-of-state parameter have recently been\nreported analyzing the observed data from high redshift supernova and Hubble Space\nTelescope [3]. The most favored physical explanations for dark energy are cosmological\nconstant and quintessence, see the review [4]. In spite of enormous activity on this subject, the\nnature of dark energy remains mysterious and it is hoped that its resolution would profoundly\naffect fundamental physics [2,5].\nIn theoretical physics, quantum gravity (QG) has proved to be the biggest stumblingblock in the quest for unification. Superstrings and loop quantum gravity are believed to be\nthe leading theories in the mainstream physics, though canonical quantization is also being\npursued [6]. Unlike dark energy problem, QG has essentially a philosophical motivation: if\nboth GR and quantum theory are fundamental, they ought to be unified. Another argument for\nQG stems from the speculation that in the early universe, the classical picture of space-time\nwould fail during Planck epoch (note that Planck time, \u03c4\u03c1 ~ 10-44 sec and length ~ 10-33 cm),\n\n2\n\n\fand quantization would become imperative. While from the observational point of view, early\nuniverse implications are very uncertain, there are significant questions that can be raised at a\nconceptual level. Is space-time illusion ? Is space-time discrete ? What is the meaning of the\narrow of time ? May be QG will lead to a revision of space-time picture or may be there exists\nan underlying radically different reality, e.g. spin networks [7] and spin foams [8] from which\nemerges space-time geometry, Carlip in [6] makes a brief reference to such radical departures.\nThe aim of this short essay is to re-visit the space-time interaction hypothesis [9] that\noffers an elegant and simple resolution to the dark energy puzzle, and throws light on the\nnature of space and time. One of its speculative consequences, namely the time-varying speed\nof light, has recently been discussed in the context of various scenarios of superluminal\nphenomenon in [10]. For the sake of self-contained discussion let us first state the postulates\nas presented in [9].\n(a)\n\nThere is a state 'superspace' which has its own energy called fundamental energy.\n\n(b)\n\nTime is something which operates upon the state 'superspace' to transform the\nfundamental energy to known from of energy thereby creating universe.\nSince the words like 'superspace' and 'fundamental energy' have different\n\nconnotations in the contemporary physics literature, we refer to the later expositions and\nelucidations of this hypothesis to avoid confusion [10-11]. Superspace or source space is a\npre-primordial state before the universe came into being, and the time is a cause of the\nbecoming of the universe. We may view the universe creation as a spontaneous phase\ntransition such that time is a primeval cause of this transition i.e. time unfolds the universe.\nThough we associated energy with the superspace in the original statement of the hypothesis,\nit is not necessary at an abstract level : we could simply say the quantity of space instead. A\nsequential, finite duration act of transformation is envisaged, with each succession of\ntransformation the quantity of manifest universe increases. It was argued that the Nature\nshould not be irregular and partial implying that the length of time duration in each act of\ntransformation is equal, and the quantity of space to transformed is also equal. While writing\nthe monograph [10], I became aware of the original saying, cause acequat affection, from [12]\nand the interpretation in classical physics that the cause and effect are two successive forms of\nthe constant quantity of energy. It is interesting that this form of causality is inherent in our\nhypothesis. The nature of time is radically different: it is discrete, unidirectional and action\n\n3\n\n\fitself. On the order hand, the space is a continuum in the sense of wholeness. How is this\nuniverse related with the observable physical universe?\nTo answer this question we have to introduce certain assumptions and definitions. Let\nus assume spherical geometry of space, elementary volume Ve is created in each elementary\ntime interval assumed to be Planck time \u03c4p. Planck constant is treated as a unit conversion\nparameter, and introducing some energy conversion unit, Ve can be equivalently expressed as\nenergy. Evolution of universe proceeds as expanding sphere, and at each act of transformation\nspherical shells are created. Simple calculations [10] show that beginning with a size of ~ 108\ncm, within less than a second spatial regions of ~ 10-21 cm came into existence, and the length\nscales of the order of Planck length are created at the age of ~ 1010 yr (contrast this with bigbang model in which very early universe, the Planck era, is believed to have this size). Let us\ndenote such elementary spatio-temporal structures symbolically by Ei , i = 1,2,... N. Each Ei\nis characterized by internal time, translational motion and spin. The proposed structures are\nendowed with Gaussian-like shapes such that the tails make the whole universe a space\ncontinuum. Two or more than two Eis can combine to form lumps or aggregates-such spatiotemporal aggregates constitute matter. At large scale, in the history of universe, statistical\nlaws determine the distribution of Eis with spatial sizes ranging from 108 cm down to the size\ncreated at that age of the universe. Qualitative picture that emerges from these considerations\nis as follows.\nUniverse at large\nRadial expansion rate of the universe is decelerating, and the radial expansion velocity\nserves the purpose of a cosmic limiting velocity. Note that the velocity of the order of 1022\ncm/sec existed at the age of one second of the universe. Since the elementary time interval, \u03c4p\nor its integral multiples are fundamental in our model, the record of possible high speeds in\nthe past exists as a memory and could be recalled to exceed present day speed of light i.e. the\nlimiting velocity principle is not absolute [10]. In the early universe, Eos with different sizes\nand very high speeds were in random motion \u2013 colliding with each other, forming aggregates\nand so on, while the universe also was undergoing fast expansion. It is possible that as\nuniverse evolved, a part of it attained almost thermodynamical equilibrium. We conjecture\nthat our solar system and galaxy are possible located in that region i.e. the matter we see\naround us became synthesized in that region. The region in the vicinity of boundary of the\n\n4\n\n\funiverse would be in a highly non-equilibrium state. Since the energy density averaged over\nwhole of the universe is always constant, we are free to assume it equal to \u03c1s i.e. there is no\ndark energy puzzle. As regards to the accelerating phenomenon in SNIa [2], a tentative\npossibility is to imagine these objects in the vicinity of the boundary of the universe where\nnon-equilibrium state leads to formations and disintegrations of the structures that fly apart at\nan accelerating rate.\nFundamental Physics\nThe basic building blocks of universe in our model are Eis. How does one construct\nmatter from them? What are the fundamental interactions? The spatio-temporal structures are\nfundamental, therefore we do not have to postulate quarks, preons, ad infinitum. These, Eis\ncombine with each other by some geometrical rules, and spin-spin interaction is proposed to\nbe the fundamental interaction. Perhaps spin networks [7] or some other combinational rules\nwill guide us to develop this idea. A modest, though radically new approach has been pursued\nbased on the assumption that neutrino(s), electron (positron) and photon are primary\nelementary objects for matter [13]. In this approach, electronic charge is given a mechanical\ninterpretation as a manifestation of fractional spin ~ e2/c, and the Maxwell field equations\nrepresent rotational photon fluid.\nOur hypothesis has some testable consequences : time-varying velocity of light, lifetime of an unstable particle and non-equivalence of inertial frames, and those related with\nphoton-fluid [10,13]. Alternative cosmological model proposed here can be put into rigorous\ncomputation, e.g. by suitably changing the algorithm of [14] or the ones used in variable\nspeed of light models [10]. Such a calculation will result into the history of universe that can\nbe tested against CMB observations and the values of \u03a9B and \u03a9DM.\nThe most significant contribution of our work is the insight gained on the nature of\nspace and time. A detailed critique on relativistic space-time has been presented earlier [1011], here we focus our brief remarks on some ideas that deny physical reality to space-time.\nPenrose attempts to build space-time from discrete angular momentum and combinational\nprinciples : there seems to be a logical flaw since the concept of angular momentum\npresupposes space, see also a comment on p.148 in [7]. Another debatable point is the belief\nthat quantum mechanics (QM) is fundamental. An interesting notion that has been discussed\nin the literature is that of a causal set [15]: at smallest scales a locally finite set of elements\n\n5\n\n\fendowed with a partial order is postulated. I find the ideas like uniformly embedded points,\nand the assumption on the 4-volume in this approach interesting. However, in our approach\nspace is a continuum and isolated objects correspond to an approximation, while time is the\ncause itself, and postulated to be discrete. As regards to the definition of a partially ordered\nset that is provided an order relation that is transitive and noncircular [15], this is nothing but\na restatement of time's arrow. Rather provocative claim by Barbour is that time is an illusion\n[16]. A careful study of relativity (both special and general) shows that time is merely a\nparameter that labels changes in spatial relations [11], therefore it is not surprising to arrive at\nthe conclusion that time does not exist at all, as Barbour says. However, Barbour's approach\ncould be criticized on several ground, see [17]. In my opinion, the emphasis on QM in any\nfundamental approach to space and time is most probably flawed: in spite of recent claims\ndemonstrating weirdness of QM, there are many unanswered questions related with single\nsystem and QM [18].\nIn conclusion, the ideas put forward here have immense potential to address some of\nthe challenging fundamental questions in physics and cosmology. Admittedly the progress of\nthis programme based on the space-time interaction hypothesis has been slow, but considering\nthe fact that it has so far been a solo effort of the author, it is not too bad either : the present\napproach articulates a new paradigm for unity in physics.\nAcknowledgement\nThe Library facility of Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi is acknowledged.\n\n6\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n\nA.D.
