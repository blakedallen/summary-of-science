Skyrmions (SK\n) and their con+\njugates, antiskyrmions (SK ), consist of K neutral spin\nwaves bound to a particle in the empty reversed-spin (\u2191)\nLL or to a hole in the filled (\u2193) LL, respectively.20 In the\nIQH regime, the relevant particles are the reversed-spin\nelectrons (eR ) and the LL holes (h), and the skyrmions\n\u2212\n+\ncan be viewed as SK\n= eR (eR h)K or SK\n= h(eR h)K\nbound states, analogous to interband charged excitons\n\u00b1 31\nXK\n. In the FQH regime, skyrmions consist of reversedspin quasielectrons16 (QER ) and Laughlin quasiholes4\n\u2212\n+\n(QH) bound to form SK\n= QER (QER QH)K and SK\n=\n20\nQH(QER QH)K . The analogy between FQH and IQH\nskyrmions is most evident in the composite fermion (CF)\npicture7 in which QER and QH are represented by particles and holes at the integral filling of their effective\nCF LL's. In both regimes, skyrmions are charged quasiparticles carrying large spin K. If the Zeeman energy\nEZ in a sample is sufficiently small for the isolated eR ,\nh, QER , and QH quasiparticles to become become unstable towards creation and binding of a number (K) of\nspin waves to form skyrmions, the number of spin flips\nper particle added to or removed from a filled (electron\nor CF) LL is K. This quantity (K) sets the slope of\nthe electron spin polarization hSz i, proportional to the\nKnight shift measured in the NMR experiments,12,13 as\na function of the filling factor near \u03bd = 1, 31 , etc.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nTwo decades ago, transport experiments on the twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems in a high magnetic field B revealed rich new physics associated with the\nunique properties of their charge excitations, including\nthe pair of most striking phenomena, the integral1,2 and\nfractional3\u20137 quantum Hall effects (IQHE and FQHE).\nBoth effects are the manifestation of a finite gap opening\nin the charge excitation spectrum at a series of (integral\nor fractional) values of the Landau level (LL) filling factor \u03bd = 1, 2, 13 , 23 , etc., and of the quasiparticle nature of\nthe elementary charge excitations of this series of gapped\n(and thus incompressible) ground states.8,9\nRecent development of nuclear magnetic resonance10\n(NMR) techniques allowed their successful application to\nthe quantum Hall systems,11\u201313 and ultimately opened\na new area of research associated with their spin degree of freedom. The quantum Hall systems with spin\nexcitations are very attractive to both theory and experiment because of their fundamental aspects as well\nas for potential for applications. They are liquids with\nunique (Laughlin) correlations4,14,15 and unique excitations (integrally or fractionally charged quasiparticles\nwithout4 or with16 spin, skyrmions17\u201320 and their collective excitations,21 and charge22 and spin waves23). On\nthe other hand, the hyperfine coupling of the mobile electron spin excitations to the localized nuclear spins of the\nunderlying atoms24\u201326 creates the possibility of controlling the latter by inducing appropriate phase transitions\nin the 2DEG under variation of such experimentally adjusted macroscopic parameters as magnetic or electric\nfields, pressure, or temperature.27 If using nuclear spin\nstates as a physical realization of quantum bits for storage\n1\n\n\fwell width, etc.), in agreement with experiments. However, it is quite remarkable that (because skyrmions of\nthe \u03bd = 13 state occur only at much smaller values of EZ\nthan skyrmions at \u03bd = 1) the energy required to create\nan electron spin excitation is much smaller in the IQH\nregime than in the FQH regime over a long range of EZ .\nThis is opposite to the relation between charge excitation\ngaps, which scale\n\u221a as h\u0304\u03c9c \u221d B for IQH states and a (much\nsmaller) EC \u221d B for FQH states.\nAt this stage of our study, we have limited ourselves to\nthe calculation and analysis of a simple spectral function\nfor the idealized many-electron states. This only allows\nfor estimates of relative relaxation times \u03c4 \u22121 for different\nmicroscopic processes, but not for their actual magnitudes. The model also neglects the effects of (i) the finite\nwidth of the quasi-2DEG, the tilt of the magnetic field,\nthe particular density profile \u033a(z) in the direction normal to the 2DEG plane, or the nuclear polarization profile \u033aN (z) in that direction;26 (ii) the interaction-induced\nelectron or hole scattering to higher LL's (i.e., LL mixing); (iii) disorder; or (iv) non-equilibrium processes. All\nthese effects may become important in realistic experimental systems, leading to the reduction of the electronic\ninteraction energy scale compared to the nuclear Zeeman\nenergy due to the finite width of electronic wave functions (i) or screening (ii), dependence of the nuclear spin\nrelaxation rate on the correlation between \u033a(z) and \u033aN (z)\nprofiles (i), or localization of electronic excitations that\nrelaxes the angular momentum conservation law in the\nspin-wave\u2013nucleus or skyrmion\u2013nucleus scattering processes (iii). We plan to study these and other possible\neffects in the future, and the motivation for the analysis\nof the ideal model used here is based on the fact that\nsuch model allows identification and classification of possible elementary microscopic spin-flip processes, as well\nas the formulation of the involved selection rules which\nwill be only modified to a various degree depending on\nthe specific experimental conditions.\n\nOf the most recent ones, particularly intriguing seems\nthe NMR experiment of Kuzma et al.13 which revealed\nextremely long nuclear spin relaxation time in the FQH\nregime, \u03c4 \u2264 0.5 s, exceeding times recorded earlier29 by\n\u223c 103 . So different a relaxation time found in seemingly similar systems suggest that different microscopic\nmechanisms can be responsible for nuclear spin relaxation, depending on experimentally variable conditions.\nDiscussion of such mechanisms is the subject of this work.\nWe report on detailed numerical studies of the hyperfine interaction of the incompressible quantum Hall states\nat \u03bd = 1 and 31 , as well as their spin excitations (spin\nwaves), reversed-spin quasiparticles, and skyrmions),\nwith the localized nuclear spins. The many-electron wave\nfunctions are obtained from exact-diagonalization calculations carried out in the Haldane spherical geometry,\nneglecting disorder and excitations to higher orbital LL's\nor to higher quantum well subbands. The spectral function \u03c4 \u22121 (E) that describes response of the 2DEG to the\nreversal of an embedded localized spin and governs nuclear spin relaxation time \u03c4 for the particular microscopic\n2DEG-nucleus spin-flip process is calculated.\nWe find that in a incompressible \u03bd = 1 or 31 state,\nthe reversal of a nuclear spin creates a spin wave of a finite wave vector k simply related to the area occupied by\none electron, (k\u03bb)2 \u2248 \u03bd (where \u03bb is the magnetic length).\nSince the spin wave dispersion ESW (k) begins at the electronic Zeeman gap, ESW (0) = EZ , the energy of a spin\nwave coupled to a nuclear spin exceeds EZ by a term\nESW (k) \u2212 ESW (0) which is of the order\n\u221a of the characteristic Coulomb energy EC = e2 /\u03bb \u221d B. Since EZ and\nEC are both much larger than the nuclear Zeeman gap,\nthe energy conservation is expected to exclude creation\n(or annihilation) of spin waves as an efficient mechanism\nfor nuclear spin relaxation. Consequently, very long relaxation times \u03c4 are expected for nuclear spins embedded\nin a (locally) incompressible IQH or FQH state, even if\nEZ could be made arbitrarily small (by means of appropriate doping or application of pressure).\nAt \u03bd slightly different from 1 or 31 , skyrmions (or\nreversed-spin quasiparticles) appear in the incompressible quantum Hall liquid. The response function \u03c4 \u22121 (E)\nis calculated for these objects and shown to have peaks\ncorresponding to their \"internal spin excitations\" in\nwhich the skyrmion spin K and angular momentum L\nboth change by one (SK \u2192 SK\u00b11 ).19,20 It is also found\n\u22121\nthat the oscillator strength \u03c4K\nof these transitions increases with increasing K. Since the energy gap for the\ninternal skyrmion excitations is much smaller than EZ\n(and, in particular, it is equal to the nuclear Zeeman gap\nat the series of values of EZ ), the skyrmion\u2013nucleus spinflip processes will be allowed by the energy conservation\nlaw, and provide efficient nuclear spin relaxation mechanism under experimental conditions.\nIn both IQH and FQH regimes, our results imply critical dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate on the\npresence of skyrmions in the 2DEG (dependent on \u03bd, EZ ,\n\nII. MODEL\nA. Electron liquid\n\nAs an extension of the earlier work on the spin excitations of the 2DEG in the quantum Hall regime,18,20\nwe study coupling of these excitations to the localized\n(e.g. nuclear) spins. The model to describe the 2DEG\nis that of Ref. 20, except that it is now extended to include the presence of a nucleus. In order to preserve\nthe 2D symmetry of an infinite quantum well in a finite\nsize calculation, the electrons are confined to a Haldane\nsphere5 of radius R. The magnetic field B normal to the\nsurface is due to a Dirac monopole in the center of the\nsphere. The monopole strength 2Q is defined in the units\nof flux quantum\n\u03c60 = hc/e, so that 4\u03c0R2 B = 2Q\u03c60 and\n\u221a\n\u03bb = R/ Q is the magnetic length. The single-electron\n\n2\n\n\fstates (monopole harmonics) are the eigenstates5,32 of\nmagnitude (l) and projection (m) of angular momentum\nand of spin projection \u03c3, and they form g-fold (g = 2l+1)\ndegenerate LL's labeled by n = l \u2212 Q.\nThe cyclotron energy h\u0304\u03c9c \u221d B is assumed\n\u221a much larger\nthan the Coulomb energy EC = e2 /\u03bb \u221d B. However,\nno assumption is made about the electron Zeeman energy, and \u03b7 = EZ /EC is a (small) free parameter of the\nmodel. As a result, only the \u03c3 = \u2212 21 (\u2193) and + 12 (\u2191)\nstates of the lowest (n = 0) LL need be included in the\ncalculation, denoted simply by |m\u03c3i.\nThe many-electron Hamiltonian in the lowest LL is\nX\nH=\nc\u2020m1 \u03c3 c\u2020m2 \u03c3\u2032 cm3 \u03c3\u2032 cm4 \u03c3 hm1 m2 |V | m3 m4 i\nX \u2020\n+\ncm\u2191 cm\u2191 EZ ,\n(1)\n\nthis work. However, the dominant effects of such localization, at least in the weak disorder regime, can easily\nbe predicted by analogy with the interband emission of\nneutral and charged excitons. For spin waves, the localization alters the relative occupation of different k-states\n(in particular, it increases occupation of the k = 0 state).\nHowever, we show later that spin waves do not couple efficiently to nuclear spins regardless of k. For skyrmions,\nlocalization of their cyclotron orbits in the lower energy\nareas (without significant distortion of their wave functions) has two consequences: (i) Freezing of the positions\nof (few) skyrmions relative to (many) nuclei and thus\nvariation of the electron spin polarization from one nucleus to another; this causes broadening of the Knight\nshift over the measured sample in the NMR experiment;\ndelocalization of skyrmions and restoration of uniform\nelectron spin polarization at higher temperatures is called\nthe \"motional narrowing\" of NMR lines. (ii) Variation\nof skyrmion energies due to confinement relaxes the energy conservation law for the skyrmion\u2013nucleus spin-flip\nprocesses, and thus broadens the minima of the nuclear\nspin relaxation time \u03c4 as a function of EZ . Nevertheless,\nour main conclusions regarding the form of the continuous (due to spin waves) and discrete (due to skyrmions)\nparts of the 2DEG response function, and the role of the\ntwo types of spin excitations for nuclear spin relaxation\nremain valid independently of localization.\n\nwhere c\u2020m\u03c3 and cm\u03c3 are the electron creation and annihilation operators, the summation goes over all orbital and\nspin indices, and V is the Coulomb interaction potential.\nThe N -electron eigenstates are expanded in the basis of\nSlater determinants\n|m1 \u03c31 . . . mN \u03c3N i = c\u2020m1 \u03c31 . . . c\u2020mN \u03c3N |vaci ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |vaci is the vacuum state. Basis (2) allows automatic resolution of two good many-body\nquantum numP\nbers, projectionsPof spin (Sz = \u03c3i ) and of angular momentum (Lz =\nmi ). However, the lengths of spin (S)\nand of angular momentum (L) are resolved numerically\nin the numerical diagonalization of each (Sz , Lz ) Hilbert\nsubspace. The additional quantum number K = 21 N \u2212 S\nmeasures the number of reversed spins relative to the\nmaximally polarized state. The many-electron states on\na (finite) sphere converge to the states on an (infinite)\nplane in the Q = (R/\u03bb)2 \u2192 \u221e limit, only the spherical\norbital numbers L and Lz must be appropriately33 replaced by the planar ones, the projections of total and\ncenter-of-mass angular momentum, M and MCM .\nIn the lowest energy states of the system described by\nHamiltonian (1) near the integral or odd-denominator\nfractional filling of the lowest LL (\u03bd = 1 or 13 ), a\nsmall number of spin waves or skyrmions move (to a\ngood approximation, independently) in the appropriate\nincompressible quantum Hall \"background\" state. Being charge neutral excitations, spin waves move along\nstraight lines and carry linear momentum h\u0304k. On a\nsphere, their linear orbits are closed into great circles,\nand the linear wave vector k takes on discrete values\nfollowing from the quantization of angular momentum,\nL = kR = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Skyrmions (SK ) on the other hand\nare charged, particle-like excitations that move along circular cyclotron orbits similar to those of electrons. Their\nmotion is therefore similarly quantized in both geometries, with the lowest LL of states having M = MCM + K\nand MCM = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . (on a plane) or L = Q \u2212 K\nand Lz = L, L \u2212 1, L \u2212 2, . . . (on a sphere), respectively.\nBoth spin waves and skyrmions may become localized\nin the presence of disorder which has been ignored in\n\nB. Coupling to nuclear spin\n\nThe coupling of the electron system (the \"background\"\nquantum Hall state and its spin excitations) to a single\nisolated localized nuclear spin will be described by the\ncontact hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian10\nX\nF =A\nIj Sk \u03b4 (rj \u2212 Rk ) ,\n(3)\nj,k\n\nwhere A is the coupling constant, and Sj and Ik (rj and\nRk ) denote the spin (position) of the jth electron and kth\nnucleus, respectively. Moreover, the distance between\nnearest nuclei will be assumed sufficiently large to justify\nneglecting their direct dipolar interaction, and exclude\nany multi-nucleus phenomena.\nDue to the translational/rotational invariance of the\n2DEG, the position of the nucleus can be conveniently\nchosen at the north pole of the sphere, where all electron\nwave functions of the lowest LL vanish, except for |l \u2191i\nand |l \u2193i. Then, ignoring the overall coupling constant\n(independent of the system size, R or Q), the transverse\npart of F describing the spin-flip processes with \u2206Sz = 1\nand projected onto the lowest LL simplifies to\nF = c\u2020l\u2191 cl\u2193 .\n\n(4)\n\nClearly, the reversal of the localized (nuclear) spin is accompanied by a reversal of an electronic spin spread over\na (cyclotron) orbit of finite radius \u223c \u03bb.\n3\n\n\fAccording to the Fermi golden rule, the oscillator\n\u22121\nstrength \u03c4if\nfor the transition between a given pair of\ninitial and final electronic eigenstates, |ii and |f i, is proportional to the square of the matrix element of F ,\n\nk\u03bb\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n(a ) N = 2 0, 2Q =1 9\n\n(b ) 2Q = N -1\n\n(c)\n\u03c4 \u22121\n\n1 .0\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n0 .8\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4 - 1 \u221aN\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\u03c4if\n= |hf | F |ii| ,\n\n0\n\n0 .6\n\n0\n\nk\u03bb\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0 .4\n\nand, accordingly, the spectral function for a given initial\n(ground) state is\nX\n\u22121\n\u03c4 \u22121 (E) \u2261 \u03c4i\u22121 (E) =\n\u03c4if\n\u03b4[E \u2212 (Ei \u2212 Ef )],\n(6)\n\nK=1\nK=0\n\n0 .2\nb ubble size\n\n0 .0\n0\n\nf\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nL\n\n10\n\n= \u03c4 \u22121\n12\n\n1 4 0 .0\n\nN 10 15 20 25\n\n0\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\nFIG. 1. (a) The spin wave energy spectrum (energy E\nvs. angular momentum L and wave vector k) at \u03bd = 1 calculated for N = 20 electrons on Haldane sphere. The bubble\ndiameters give the oscillator strength \u03c4 \u22121 for the spin wave\nemission coupled to the nuclear spin reversal. (b) The response function of a planar \u03bd = 1 state to a nuclear spin\nreversal (oscillator strength \u03c4 \u22121 calculated\non a sphere for\n\u221a\ndifferent N \u2264 25 and normalized by N vs. energy E). (c)\nThe response function \u03c4 \u22121 shown as a function of wave vector k. Zeeman energy EZ is excluded and \u03bb is the magnetic\nlength.\n\nwhere Ei and Ef are the energies of the initial and final\nstates, respectively. Also, from Eq. (4), F couples the\nelectron states with equal Lz and Sz different by one.\nNote that \u03c4 \u22121 (E) is only defined up to a coupling constant that we are unable to calculate. Therefore, when\ncomparing our results with experiment, only the relative intensities of different microscopic spin-flip processes\n(e.g., processes that involve spin waves with different k,\nskyrmions with different K, or skyrmions as opposed to\nspin waves) are meaningful, but we are unable to estimate\nthe actual magnitude of the nuclear spin relaxation rates.\nHowever, only these relative intensities are a universal\nproperty of the electron quantum Hall system, virtually\nindependent of many experimentally variable parameters\n(electron density, nuclear spin polarization profile across\nthe 2DEG plane26 , etc.). While spectral function (6)\ncaptures the essential physics of the interaction between\nan (ideal) Laughlin liquid and localized spins, the details\nof both the liquid and the spins must be included in a\nrealistic calculation of the relaxation rates.\nDue to the simple form of the operator F in our basis (2), the oscillator strengths can be easily evaluated\nfor any known pair of |ii and |f i eigenstates. Therefore,\nthe most difficult computational task is the accurate calculation of the many-electron eigenfunctions. Moreover,\nbecause of the breaking of both spatial and spin symmetry by the operator F , entire multiplets with different Lz\nand Sz must be calculated for each L and S. Hence, the\nproper identification of the relevant many-electron eigenstates that: (i) describe a planar system in the R/\u03bb \u2192 \u221e\nlimit, (ii) have significant \u03c4 \u22121 , becomes essential.\n\nsubspaces, with K = 0 or 1. However, the length of the\ntotal projection of F |ii, the vector obtained by acting by\nF on the initial IQH ground state, onto the K = 0 subspace equals N \u22121 in a finite N -electron initial state, and\nthus it disappears in the N \u2192 \u221e limit. Therefore, not\nsurprisingly, the only spin excitations coupled to an infinite (planar) \u03bd = 1 state by F are those with K = 1. Of\nthese, the only ones with significant oscillator strength\n\u03c4 \u22121 turn out to be the spin wave states, which at the\nsame time are the lowest energy excitations at \u03bd = 1.\nThe numerical results for the spin-flip transitions corresponding to creation (annihilation) of spin waves in a\nfinite \u03bd = 1 state of N = 20 electrons at 2Q = N \u22121 = 19\nare shown in Fig. 1(a). In this and all other spectra in the\npaper E stands for the energy difference between the final\nand initial states and is given in the units of EC = e2 /\u03bb.\nThe Zeeman energy EZ is not included. The horizontal\naxis shows the total angular momentum L (for the spin\nwaves, L = kR), and the oscillator strength \u03c4 \u22121 is proportional to the diameter of a bubble around each energy\nlevel marked with a cross.\nAs could be predicted from Eq. (4), the reversal of an\nelectronic spin induced by F occurs over an area corresponding to a cyclotron orbit. This sets a characteristic\nlength scale \u03be \u223c \u03bb for the efficient spin-flip process, and\nindeed in Fig. 1(a) \u03c4 \u22121 has a maximum at a finite L,\nwhile it vanishes in the limits of both small and large L.\nTo determine the spectral function of a \u03bd = 1 state\nof an infinite 2DEG we have compared data obtained\nfor different electron numbers, N \u2264 25, and plotted the\nresults together in Fig. 1(b). The oscillator strengths\nfor\nvalues of E are multiplied by the factor\n\u221a discrete\n\u221a\nN \u221d Q \u221d R/\u03bb, which comes from normalization of\n\nIII. INTEGRAL QUANTUM HALL REGIME\nA. Spin waves\n\nWe begin with the integral quantum Hall regime and\nthe filling factor of precisely \u03bd = 1. We evaluate numerically the oscillator strengths \u03c4 \u22121 for all possible transitions induced by the operator F from the initial nondegenerate incompressible IQH ground state with L = 0,\nSz = \u2212 21 N , and K = 0. From the commutator [F, S 2 ] it\ncan easily be shown that the spin-flip transition defined\nby F couples the K = 0 initial state |ii to two different\n4\n\n\fthe wave function of the extended spin wave over the\nentire sphere. All data points lie nicely on one regular\ncurve that describes the spin wave creation/annihilation\nin both finite (spherical) and infinite (planar) systems.\nAs it is the characteristic wave vector k (through the\ncharacteristic length scale \u03be) rather than the energy E\nthat determines the position of the maximum of \u03c4 \u22121 ,\nin the inset (c) we replot it as a function of k (only setting \u03c4 \u22121 (0) to zero as appropriate for an infinite system).\n\u03c4 \u22121 (k) is a more universal characteristic of the \u03bd = 1 IQH\nstate than \u03c4 \u22121 (E) in a sense that the spin wave dispersion ESW (k), in an ideal 2D system derived by Kallin and\nHalperin,23 in experiment may also depend on additional\ncharacteristics of actual 2DEG (e.g., the well width). As\n\u22121\nexpected, \u03c4 \u22121 (k) has a maximum at k \u223c \u03bb\n\u221a , which defines the spin-flip length scale of \u03be \u223c \u03bb \u221d B.\nBased on Fig. 1, we make the following observations:\n(i) The incompressible \u03bd = 1 liquid responds to the reversal of a localized spin by emission of a spin wave whose\nkinetic energy, ESW (k), increases as a function of k; (ii)\nThe response function \u03c4 \u22121 (E) vanishes in both k = 0\nand \u221e limits, and it reaches maximum at E corresponding to k \u223c \u03bb\u22121 ; (iii) When electron Zeeman energy is\nadded, the energy of a k \u223c \u03bb\u22121 spin wave that can couple to a localized spin reversal is a sum of two terms, EZ\nand ESW (\u03bb\u22121 ); and (iv) Since ESW (\u03bb\u22121 ) \u2248 41 EC (in an\nideal system23 ) is typically much larger than the nuclear\nZeeman energy, the energy conservation prevents efficient\nrelaxation through emission of spin waves in a (locally)\nincompressible liquid regardless of the value of EZ .\nThis weak coupling of the \u03bd = 1 state to the nuclear\nspins obtained above agrees well with long nuclear spin\nrelaxation times measured at this filling factor at low\ntemperatures.12 It is evident from the experiments showing rapid increase of the relaxation rate when either \u03bd\nis moved away from 1 or temperature is elevated (from\n2.1 to 4.2 K)12 that charged excitations provide more\nefficient mechanism for nuclear spin relaxation than the\nspin waves. Let us then move on to the analysis of the\nspin-flip processes in the presence of such excitations,\nreversed-spin quasiparticles and skyrmions.\n\n0 .1 0\n(b ) N = 1 2, 2Q =1 2\n\n0 .0 0\nE Z = 0 .0 2 e 2 /\u03bb\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\nn\nno\n\n-0 .10\nE Z= 0\n\n-0 .15\n\nin\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nK\n\n6 0 .0 0\n\np\n\n0 .0 8\n0 .0 6\n0 .0 4\n\nK =1\n\n-0 .20\n1\n\nr\n\nga\n\nskyrm io n g ap\n\n(a) N = 12 , 2Q = 12\n0\n\nte\n\nac\n\ng\n\n\u2206 (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n-0 .05\n\ntin\n\n0 .0 2\n\n0 .0 4\n\n0 .0 6\n\n0 .0 2\nK=0\n\n0 .0 8\n\n0 .0 0\n0 .1 0\n\nE Z (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\nFIG. 2.

Open and full symbols correspond to the Zeeman energy EZ = 0 and 0.02 e2 /\u03bb, respectively (\u03bb is the magnetic length). (b) The energy gap \u2206 for\nskyrmion spin excitations (SK \u2192 SK\u00b11 ) at \u03bd = 1\u00b1 as a function of EZ , compared to the spin wave gap \u2206 = EZ at \u03bd = 1.\n\ncal axis gives the skyrmion energy E measured from the\nmaximally polarized (K = 0) state which in this case corresponds to one spin hole in the \u03bd = 1 state. On the horizontal axis we show the skyrmion spin (or size), K, which\nis also related20 to its angular momentum, L = Q \u2212 K.\nThe open symbols in Fig. 2(a) mark the skyrmion energy spectrum ES (K), excluding the Zeeman energy. In\nan infinite system (and not only at \u03bd = 1, but also\nin the FQH regime discussed in the following section),\nit can be quite accurately approximated by ES (K) \u2248\n\u2212E [K/(K + 1)]\u03b1 . In an ideal 2D system, the binding energy of anpinfinite skyrmion at \u03bd = 1 is known\nexactly,18 E = 41 \u03c0/2 EC , and any choice of \u03b1 \u223c 1 captures the most essential feature of ES (K), which is that\nES (K \u2212 1) \u2212 ES (K) > ES (K) \u2212 ES (K + 1) for each K.\nAlthough our numerics yields \u03b1 \u2248 1.7 at \u03bd = 1, it\nis quite illuminating to solve the simplest case of \u03b1 = 1\n(the equally simple arithmetics for \u03b1 = 2 gives essentially\nidentical answer; moreover, for \u03bd = 13 it actually seems\nthat \u03b1 \u2248 1). When the Zeeman term KEZ is added to the\nskyrmion energy as shown with full dots in Fig. 2(a) the\nground state becomes a finite-size skyrmion with a certain K (as marked with an open circle, for EZ = 0.02 EC\nit turns out to be K = 3). Using our simple model\n\nB. Skyrmions\n\nES (K) = \u2212E\n\nIt is well-known that an extra particle (a reversed-spin\nelectron or a spin hole) added to the \u03bd = 1 ferromagnetic\nground state induces and binds spin waves (whose number K depends on EZ /EC ) to form a skyrmion18 (SK ), a\nparticle-like charged excitations carrying (possibly large)\nspin K. In Fig. 2(a) we replot the (anti)skyrmion energy\nspectrum calculated earlier in Ref. 20 for N = 12 electrons at 2Q = 12. Using the exact particle-hole symmetry within an isolated LL, this state can be mapped onto\none in which an extra reversed-spin electron is added to\nthe \u03bd = 1 state at the same value of 2Q = 12, and hence\nit will be denoted here as \u03bd = 1\u00b1 . Again, the verti-\n\nK\n+ KEZ\nK +1\n\n(7)\n\nwe obtain that the transition between the SK\u22121 and SK\nground states occurs at EZ = E/[K(K+1)] (in particular,\nthe smallest skyrmion, S1 , is stable below EZ = 21 E),\nand the excitation gap \u2206K from SK to the lower of the\nSK\u22121 or SK+1 states [it is plotted in Fig. 2(b) for the\nnumerical data of Fig. 2(a)] reaches its maximum value\nof \u2206K = E/[K(K + 1)(K + 2)] at EZ = E/[K(K + 2)].\nAs seen in Fig. 2(b), the most striking feature of the\nskyrmion energy spectrum in the presence of the (sufficiently small) Zeeman energy is that, in contrast to the\n\n5\n\n\fspin wave spectrum of the (locally) incompressible IQH\nliquid, the gap for spin excitations is greatly reduced\ncompared to (and largely independent of) EZ . Indeed,\nit follows from our expression for the maximum\nof \u2206K\np\nthat \u2206K /EZ \u2264 (K + 1)\u22121 and \u2206K /EZ \u2264 EZ /E. Moreover, the gap skyrmion \u2206K can be brought to resonance\nwith an arbitrarily small nuclear Zeeman energy at the\nat entire series of EZ near the SK\u22121 \u2194 SK transitions.\nBeing charged objects, skyrmions move along electronlike cyclotron orbits and repel one another through an\neffective short-range pseudopotential similar to that of\nelectrons in the lowest LL.20 Such short-range repulsion\ncauses Laughlin correlations between the skyrmions,15\nwhich therefore avoid high energy collisions with one another and behave as well-defined quasiparticles moving\nindependently in the underlying IQH liquid. We know\nthat in a similar, electron\u2013valence-hole system, Laughlin\ncorrelations of interband charged excitons (X \u2212 ) with one\nanother as well as with surrounding electrons simplify the\nphotoluminescence of a dilute (\u03bd < 13 ) 2DEG to the recombination of spatially isolated X \u2212 's.35 By analogy, we\nexpect that the many-skyrmion effects can be excluded\nfrom the skyrmion\u2013nucleus spin-flip scattering.\nTo verify the possibility of efficient nuclear spin relaxation through the interaction with skyrmions, we have\nevaluated the spectral functions \u03c4i (E) for the initial state\n|ii corresponding to a single skyrmion (or antiskyrmion)\nin a finite, N -electron \u03bd = 1 system. Due to the finite size\nof the skyrmion, its ground state is a degenerate electronlike LL. On Haldane sphere, this LL is represented by the\nangular momentum multiplet at L = Q \u2212 K. Different\nvalues of Lz = \u2212L, \u2212L+1, . . . , L label different cyclotron\norbits, and the closest orbit to the north pole (the position of the nucleus) is that with Lz = L for a skyrmion\n\u2212\n+\n(SK\n) and Lz = \u2212L for an antiskyrmion (SK\n). Clearly,\nthe value of \u03c4if for a given i \u2192 f transition involving\na skyrmion depends on Lz , which plays the role of an\nimpact parameter of the skyrmion\u2013nucleus collision.\nWe have studied numerically a few systems with different values of N and 2Q = N . For each N we have\ncalculated the complete \u03c4if spectra corresponding to the\n(anti)skyrmionic initial states |ii = S0+ , S1+ , S2+ , . . . with\ndifferent values of Lz , and to all possible finite states |f i.\nAs an example, in Fig. 3 we show the results for N = 12\nand the initial states with K = 0, 1, and 2 (for K = 1\ndata for two values of Lz is shown). The transition energy\ngiven on the horizontal axis is E = Ef \u2212 Ei (excluding\nEZ ), and the units of \u03c4 \u22121 on the vertical axis follow from\nEq. (4). In the insets we display the corresponding energy spectra in which the initial skyrmion states as well\nas all the final states can be identified for each transition.\nAll the spectra are quite similar in that they can be\ndecomposed into the quasi-continuous part at E > 0\n(here discrete because of size quantization) due to the\nresponse of the underlying IQH state discussed in the\npreceding subsection, and a single peak at E < 0 due\nto a SK \u2192 SK+1 transition.

The spectral function of the hyperfine transition\noperator F (oscillator strength \u03c4 \u22121 vs. energy E) at \u03bd = 1\u00b1\ncalculated for N = 12 electrons on Haldane sphere. Strong\npeaks at E < 0 correspond to the \"internal\" skyrmion transitions SK \u2192 SK+1 indicated with arrows in the energy spectra shown in the insets (e\u2013g). Lz is the skyrmion angular\nmomentum projection related to the impact parameter of the\nskyrmion\u2013nucleus collision. Different frames correspond to\ndifferent initial electron states: h (a), S1+ (b), and S2+ (d)\nclose to the nucleus, and S1+ farther from the nucleus (c).\nZeeman energy EZ is excluded and \u03bb is the magnetic length.\n\nterested in the processes that may conserve energy to\nallow efficient nuclear spin relaxation, let us neglect all\nE > 0 transitions and concentrate on the SK \u2192 SK+1\none, whose energy including EZ can be made equal to\nthe nuclear Zeeman gap. Clearly, it is only allowed for\n|Lz | \u2264 Q \u2212 (K + 1) and its intensity quickly decreases\nwhen Lz is increased from the minimum allowed value\n(such increase of Lz corresponding to an increase of the\nnucleus\u2013skyrmion average separation before the collision,\ni.e. of the impact parameter). Because we assume no localization and thus allow that a skyrmion moves freely\nover the position of the nucleus (placed at the north pole\nby an arbitrary choice), it is more physical to consider\n\u03c4 \u22121 summed over all allowed values of Lz as a characteristic of this \"internal skyrmion transition.\"\nIn order to complete the analysis of the role of\nskyrmions in nuclear spin relaxation, to the facts that\nskyrmion\u2013nucleus spin scattering has finite oscillator\nstrength and that it can conserve energy, we ought to\nadd the dependence on the skyrmion size, K.

On a\nsphere,5 this replaces the electronic single particle angular momentum l = Q \u2248 21 (2p + 1)(N \u2212 1) by an effective\nCF angular momentum l\u2217 = Q\u2217 \u2248 21 (N \u2212 1), where 2Q\u2217\ndenotes the effective CF monopole strength.\nThere are two types of low energy charge-neutral excitations of Laughlin \u03bd = 31 ground state, similar to the\ncharge and spin waves23 of the \u03bd = 1 state. This similarity lies at the heart of the CF picture,7 where these\nexcitations correspond to promoting one CF from a completely filled lowest (n = 0) spin-\u2193 CF LL either to the\nfirst excited (n = 1) CF LL of the same spin (\u2193) or to\nthe same CF LL (n = 0) but with the reversed spin (\u2191).\nSimilarly to \u03bd = 1, charge and spin waves at \u03bd = 31 are\ncomposed of three types of elementary quasiparticles: a\nhole in the n = 0 spin-\u2193 CF LL and the particles in the\nn = 1 spin-\u2193 and n = 0 spin-\u2191 CF LL's, representing the\nLaughlin quasihole (QH) and quasielectron (QE) and the\nreversed-spin quasielectron (QER ), respectively. Each\nof these quasiparticles is characterized by such singleparticle quantities as (fractional) electric charge, energy,\nor Landau degeneracy of the single-particle Hilbert space.\nExpecting similar behavior, we have carried out similar\ncalculations for the \u03bd \u2248 31 filling as described in the previous section for \u03bd \u2248 1. Let us begin with the Laughlin\nincompressible FQH state at precisely \u03bd = 13 . We found\nthat the reversal of a nuclear spin in this state creates a\nspin wave, in perfect analogy to what happened in the\nIQH regime. The main difference is that the spin wave\nat \u03bd = 31 consists of a QER \u2013QH pair whose interaction\nenergy scale is about an order of magnitude smaller than\nit was for a eR \u2013h pair at \u03bd = 1, predominantly due to the\nfractional QER and QH charge (but also due to a larger\nsize of the QER and QH wave functions). In Fig. 5 we\nshow the graphs for the FQH regime similar to those of\nFig. 1. The spectrum shown in Fig. 5(a) is for N = 6\nelectrons at 2Q = 15. In the CF picture, this corresponds\nto six CF's filling exactly their lowest spin-\u2193 LL of degeneracy g \u2217 = 2Q\u2217 + 1 = 6.

The position of each peak\nis the value of EZ at which the transition energy \u2206 is zero.\nThe solid line includes Gaussian broadening. (d) Same as (b)\nbut for data extrapolated to N \u2192 \u221e.\n\nto estimate \u03c4 \u22121 in an infinite system, we have recalculated \u03c4 \u22121 (K) for different N . The results are shown in\nFig. 4(a) where we plot \u03c4 \u22121 for K = 0, 1, 2, and 3 as\na function of the inverse system size, N \u22121 . Very regular\ndependence of \u03c4 \u22121 on N \u22121 for each K allows their accurate (quadratic) extrapolation to the N \u22121 \u2192 0 limit, as\nindicated with the solid lines. The result of the extrapolation is that in an infinite (planar) system, \u03c4 \u22121 increases\nmonotonously with increasing K, which indicates that\nnonmonotonic behavior in Fig. 4(b) is an artifact.\nThe nearly linear increase of the extrapolated values of\n\u03c4 \u22121 with increasing K shown in Fig. 4(d) suggests that\nthe total intensity \u03c4 \u22121 (summed over all Lz ) depends predominantly on the skyrmion area. Because in experiment\nthe differential cross-section for the skyrmion\u2013nucleus\ncollisions also depend on the skyrmion area, one can expect that also the nuclear relaxation rate will increase as\na function of K (at a constant number of skyrmions). In\nFig. 4(c) we plot the \u03c4 \u22121 peaks corresponding to subsequent SK \u2192 SK+1 transitions as a function of EZ at\nwhich the energy of this transition (E) vanishes (compare Fig. 2(b) in which the closing of the gap is shown).\nAssuming that the skyrmion\u2013nucleus spin scattering is\na dominant nuclear spin relaxation process and that it\nis most efficient when E \u2248 0, the curves obtained by\nbroadening of the discrete peaks with Gaussians imitate\nthe nuclear spin relaxation rate as a function of EZ . It\nis remarkable that when the value of EZ is lowered, the\npeaks with higher K are selected from the spectral function, the separation between the neighboring peaks decreases and their intensity increases. Let us stress that\nthis expected behavior for \u03bd = 1\u00b1 differs qualitatively\nfrom what we predict at precisely \u03bd = 1, where the relaxation rate should monotonously increase with decreasing\n\n7\n\n\f0 .3\n(c)\n\n0\n\nK=1\nK=0\nb ubble size\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nL\n\n5\n\n6\n\n5\n\n(a)\n\n-0.0 4\n2\n\nL\n\n5\n\n(b)\n\n0 .0\n0 .3\n\n= \u03c4 \u22121\n7\n\nL\n\n0 .1\n\n0 .0\n1\n\n2\n\nN 6 7 8\n\n0 .0 0\n0\n\n-0.0 4\n\n(f)\nS=2\nS=3\n\n8 0\n\n0 .0 2\n\n0 .0 4\n\n0 .0 8\n\nS Z = -2\nL Z= 1\n2 Q =14\n\n0 .0 6\n\n2\n\nE (e /\u03bb)\n0 .2\n\n1\n.\n3\n\n\u03c4 -1\n\nFIG. 5.

Similarly\nto \u03bd = 1, all\n\u221a\ndata points (with \u03c4 \u22121 multiplied by N ) fall on the same\nregular curve which, as expected, vanishes in both E = 0\nand E = \u221e limits, and reaches maximum at the energy\nE \u2248 0.025 EC , about an order of magnitude smaller than\nat \u03bd = 1. In Fig. 5(c) we replot \u03c4 \u22121 as a function of wave\nvector k = L/R. By analogy to \u03bd = 1, we expect that\nthe length of spin wave most strongly coupled by F to\na nuclear spin reversal corresponds to the smallest area\ncontaining one electron (and thus containing one unit of\nelectron spin that must flip to compensate the nuclear\nspin). For the uniform \u03bd = 13 state, the average area per\n\u221a\nelectron is 3 times larger than at \u03bd = 1, yielding 3 times\nlarger length scale \u03be, and\u221athus the maximum of \u03c4 \u22121 (k) is\nexpected at k = \u03be \u22121 \u223c ( 3\u03bb)\u22121 \u2248 0.58\u03bb\u22121 . Indeed, this\nseems to be true of our Fig. 5(c).\nTo summarize our results at precisely \u03bd = 31 , the mechanism of the coupling to the nuclear spins is very analogous. The two major differences can be predicted from\nthe simple arguments of 3 times reduced electron density\nand 3 times reduced charge of the\u221ainvolved quasiparticles.\nThese differences are (i) about 3 times larger characteristic length scale of the response \u03be (wave length of the\n\"active\" spin wave) and (ii) about 32 smaller interaction\nenergy ESW (\u03be \u22121 ) of such active spin wave. While (i) is\nthe reason for the reduction of \u03c4 \u22121 of \u221a\nthe corresponding\ntransitions (compare the maxima of N \u03c4 \u22121 in Figs. 1\nand 5), (ii) should actually enhance nuclear relaxation\ndue to spin waves (if EZ can be made disappear) as a\nresult of the weaker violation of the energy conservation.\nLet us now turn to the spin-flip processes involving\nFQH skyrmions. Their energy spectra and gaps for the\n\"internal\" excitations are very similar to those at \u03bd = 1\nexcept for an overall reduction of the interaction energy scale and breaking of the skyrmion\u2013antiskyrmion\nsymmetry.20 In particular, graphs analogous to those in\nFig. 2 describe also the FQH skyrmions, only with about\n\nL Z = -1 0 .0 8\nL Z= 0\n2Q =14\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n0 .0 2\n\n1\n\n(e )\nS =2\nS=3\n\n0 .0 8\n\nN=6\n\nS1 \u2192S2\n\n0 .0 4\n\nk\u03bb\n\n\u03c4 -1\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n\u03c4 \u22121\n\n\u03c4 -1 \u221aN\n\n(a) N = 6, 2 Q =1 5\n\n0 .0 6\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .0 8\n\nS Z = -3\nL Z= 2\n2Q =14\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n(b ) 2 Q *= N -1\n0 .1 0\n\n0 .0 8\n\nS Z = -3\nL Z = -2\n2 Q =16\n\n0 .4\n\nQE \u2192QER\n\n2 .5\n\n-\n\n2 .0\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n-\n\n1k\u03bb\n.5\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n1 .0\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n0 .5\n\nQ H \u2192 S +1\n\n0 .0\n0 .1 2\n\n0 .0\n-0 .04\n\n0 .0 0\n\n0 .0 4\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\n0 .0 8\n\n-0 .04\n\n0 .0 0\n\n0 .0 4\n\n0 .0 8\n\nE (e 2 /\u03bb)\n\nFIG. 6.

As in Fig. 3, in the insets we show the energy spectra in which the initial and final states for each transition can be found.

COMPARISON OF IQH AND FQH REGIMES\n\nLet us finally compare the skyrmion and spin wave excitations and their possible coupling to the nuclear spins\nin the IQH and FQH regimes. It turns out that the following behavior depicted in Fig. 7 that can be predicted\nfrom the simple arguments and existing analytical results\nalone is not far from the results of our exact calculations.\nThe skyrmion energy spectrum\nis adequately reproduced\np\nby Eq. (7), with E = 14 \u03c0/2 EC for the IQH regime18\nand an about 10 times smaller value for the FQH regime.\nThis determines the dependence of the skyrmion size K\nand its gap \u2206 for spin excitations (SK \u2192 SK\u00b11 ) on EZ in\nboth regimes. These plots of \u2206(EZ ) are marked as \"IQHSky\" and \"FQH-Sky\" in Fig. 7. On the other hand, it\nfollows from the fact that \u03bb is the size of a cyclotron orbit\nthat the spin waves must have k \u223c \u03bb\u22121 to strongly couple to a localized spin reversal at \u03bd = 1. And knowing23\nthe spin wave dispersion ESW (k) allows an estimate of\n8\n\n\fbe more pronounced in the IQH regime. This agrees with\nthe experiments that typically show much longer relaxation times at \u03bd = 1 than at \u03bd = 31 .\n\n0.05\n\n-S\n\n0.04\n\nap\n\nFQ\n\nH\n\n\u2206 (e 2 / \u03bb)\n\nIQ\n\nW\n\nH\n\n-S\n\nW\n\n0.3\n\np\nga\n\nW\n\ntin\nac\ner\nFQ\n\nH\n\nno\nky\n(a )\n\n(b )\n\n0.01\n\nUsing exact numerical diagonalization techniques we\nhave studied possible relaxation mechanisms of nuclear\nspins coupled through the hyperfine interaction to the\nquantum Hall states of a 2DEG at filling factors near\n\u03bd = 1 and 13 . By extrapolation of our finite-size results,\nwe were able to determine the spectral function \u03c4 \u22121 (E)\ndescribing response of an infinite (planar) 2DEG to the\nreversal of an embedded localized spin. We found that\nthe spectral function can be decomposed into a continuous part describing transitions from the incompressible\n\"background\" state, and a discrete part which is due to\nthe presence of additional charge excitations (skyrmions).\nThe continuous part of the response function \u03c4 \u22121 (E)\ndescribes emission of a spin wave, whose energy ESW is\na sum of the electronic Zeeman gap EZ and the kinetic\nenergy dependent on the wave vector k. We found that,\nwhen expressed as a function of wave vector, \u03c4 \u22121 vanishes\nin both k = 0 and \u221e\n\u221a limits, and that it has a maximum\nat a finite k \u2248 \u03bb\u22121 \u03bd. Using the known spin wave dispersion for \u03bd = 1, we showed that the emission energy of\nan \"active\" spin wave that can couple to a nuclear spin\nreversal exceeds EZ by a kinetic term \u223c 41 EC * \u03bd 2 . This\nimplies that even in the limit of vanishing EZ , the energy\nconservation law will prevent coupling of the (locally) incompressible quantum Hall states to nuclear spins. This\nresult agrees with long nuclear spin relaxation times observed in experiments in the absence of charged excitations (at precisely \u03bd = 1 or 31 and at low temperature).\nThe situation changes dramatically when skyrmions\nare introduced into the 2DEG by either moving \u03bd away\nfrom 1 or 13 , increasing temperature, or applying voltage to induce electric current. The reason for a different behavior are the so-called \"internal\" spin excitations of skyrmions (in which their spin K changes by\none) whose energy is much smaller than EZ and can be\nbrought into resonance with the nearly vanishing nuclear\nZeeman energy. Moreover, we have checked that the oscillator strength \u03c4 \u22121 of the skyrmion\u2013nucleus collision\ncorresponding to the K \u2194 (K + 1) transition is large\nand increases with increasing K.\nIn both IQH and FQH regimes, our results imply critical dependence of the nuclear spin relaxation rate on\nthe presence of skyrmions in the 2DEG, in good agreement with the experiments. The contrast between the\nforbidden relaxation due to spin waves and the efficient\nrelaxation due to skyrmions should be more pronounced\nat \u03bd = 1 than at \u03bd = 31 because of a larger (by an order\nof magnitude) interaction energy scale.\n\nIQ\n\nH\n\n-S\n\nky\n\n-S\nH\nIQ\n\nVI.

By reducing the interaction energy by an order of magnitude one\ncan also predict the spin wave gap in the FQH regime,\n1\n\u2206 \u223c EZ + 40\nEC . These two plots of \u2206(EZ ) are marked\nas \"IQH-SW\" and \"FQH-SW\" in Fig. 7.\nSince the energy conservation requires that \u2206 be equal\nor at least close to the nuclear Zeeman energy which is\nessentially zero, it is clear from Fig. 7 how the relative\nefficiencies of spin waves and skyrmions in both regimes\ndepend on EZ . It is noteworthy that the (eR \u2013h or QER \u2013\nQH) interactions can have different effect on the spin gap\n\u2206, depending on the presence of skyrmions in the system.\nCompared to a noninteracting system for which \u2206 = EZ ,\nthe interactions increase the spin gap \u2206 associated with\nthe creation of spin waves, but decrease such a gap associated with the skyrmion excitations. For spin waves,\nthe enhancement of \u2206 is due to a decrease of eR\u221a\n\u2013h or\nQER \u2013QH attraction at a finite wave vector k \u223c \u03bd/\u03bb\n(that can be interpreted as a spin wave kinetic energy).\nFor skyrmions, the reduction of \u2206 is due to interaction\ninduced level crossings and ground state transitions.\nIt is clear from Fig. 7 that the strong interactions in the\nIQH regime prevent the spin waves at \u03bd = 1 from coming into resonance with nuclear spins regardless of the\nvalue of EZ and practically eliminate them as an efficient\nnuclear spin relaxation mechanism at this filling. But\nat the same time, these interactions allow efficient relaxation near \u03bd = 1 through the spin-flip nucleus\u2013skyrmion\ncollisions over a long range of EZ . On the other hand,\nthe much weaker interactions in the FQH regime do not\ncompletely exclude nuclear relaxation by means of spin\nwave emission at EZ \u2248 0, but they considerably shorten\nthe range of EZ in which the skyrmions occur and can\nspin-flip collide with the nuclei. Therefore, a drop of the\nnuclear spin relaxation time \u03c4 caused by the introduction of charge excitations to the incompressible liquid (by\nvarying density or magnetic field to move \u03bd away from 1\nor 31 , increasing temperature, or inducing current) should\n\n9\n\n\f19\n\nH.
