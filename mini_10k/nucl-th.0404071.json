The most favorable description\nof the \u03b1\u03b1 system is the \u03b1\u03b1 resonating-group method\n(RGM) [1]. Although some of the previous works deal\nwith the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel explicitly in the 3\u03b1-cluster\nFaddeev formalism, they usually yield a large overbinding for the ground state and sometimes involve spurious\nstates because of an incomplete treatment of the Pauliforbidden states in the 3\u03b1 model space [2\u20135]. Various\ntypes of 3\u03b1 orthogonality condition models (OCM) [6\u2013\n8] also yield a similar overbinding for the ground state,\nalthough the effect of the Pauli principle between \u03b1 clusters is satisfactorily treated in each framework. Only one\nexception for this rule is the 3\u03b1 OCM in Refs. [9, 10], in\nwhich the Pauli forbidden components described by the\n\u03b1\u03b1 bound-state solutions of the deep Buck, Friedrich,\nand Wheatley (BFW) potential [11] is completely eliminated. The result is rather similar to the traditional 3\u03b1\nFaddeev calculation using Ali-Bodmer phenomenological\n\u03b1\u03b1 potential with a repulsive core [12]. In these calculations, the ground-state energy of the 3\u03b1 system is\nless than 1.5 MeV, and a simultaneous description of the\ncompact shell-model like ground state and the excited 0+\nstate with well-developed cluster structure is not possi-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: fujiwara@ruby.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\nble. The origin of the different conclusions in Refs. [8]\nand [9, 10], is spelled out in Ref. [13], in which the existence of almost forbidden Faddeev components inherent\nto this 3\u03b1 OCM using the bound-state Pauli-forbidden\nstates of the BFW potential is essential.\nA possible resolution of this overbinding problem of\nthe 3\u03b1 model is found in our new three-cluster Faddeev\nformalism, which uses singularity-free T -matrices (RGM\nT -matrices) generated from the two-cluster RGM kernels\n[14]. In this formalism, solving the Faddeev equation\nautomatically guarantees the elimination of the threecluster redundant components from the total wave function. The explicit energy dependence inherent in the exchange RGM kernel is self-consistently treated. We first\napplied this formalism to the three-dineutron and 3\u03b1 systems, and obtained complete agreement between the Faddeev calculations and variational calculations using the\ntranslationally invariant harmonic-oscillator (h.o.) basis [14, 15]. Next, this formalism was applied to a Faddeev calculation of the three-nucleon bound state [16],\nwhich employs complete off-shell T -matrices derived from\nthe non-local and energy-dependent RGM kernels of the\nquark-model N N interactions, FSS [17] and fss2 [18].\nThe fss2 model yields a triton binding energy Bt = 8.519\nMeV in the 50 channel calculation, when the np interaction is employed for all the N N pairs in the isospin basis\n[19]. The effect of the charge dependence of the two-body\nN N interaction is estimated to be \u22120.19 MeV for the triton binding energy [20]. This implies that our result is\nnot overbinding in comparison with the empirical value,\nBt exp = 8.482 MeV. If we attribute the difference, 0.15\nMeV, to the effect of the three-nucleon force, it is by far\nsmaller than the generally accepted values, 0.5 \u223c 1 MeV\n\n\f2\n[21], predicted by many Faddeev calculations employing\nmodern realistic meson-theoretical N N interactions. We\nhave further applied this three-cluster Faddeev formalism\nto the hypertriton system [22], in which the quark-model\nhyperon-nucleon (Y N ) interactions of fss2 yield a reasonable result of the hypertriton properties similar to the\nNijmegen soft-core potential NSC89 [23]. Most mathematical details for the Faddeev equation, employed in\nthis calculation, are given in the present paper.\nHere we apply the present three-cluster Faddeev formalism to the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b model for 9\u039b Be. This hypernucleus\nplays an important role to study the \u039bN interaction in\nthe p-shell \u039b-hypernuclei. From the early time of the\nhypernuclear study, 9\u039b Be is considered to be a prototype of \u03b1-cluster structure, in which the two \u03b1 clusters form a loosely bound subsystem by the effect of\nthe extra \u039b hyperon [24]. Since the Y N interaction\nis usually weaker than the N N interaction, this system is suitable for studying a subtle structure change\nof the two-\u03b1 system from 8 Be. In fact, in addition to\nthe 1/2+ ground state [25\u201328] with the \u039b-separation energy B\u039b (9\u039b Be) = 6.71 \u00b1 0.04 MeV [29], the recent \u03b3-ray\nspectroscopy [30, 31] has revealed the existence of two\nnarrow resonances in the excited states, which are supposed to be 5/2+ and 3/2+ states generated from the\nsmall spin-orbit splitting in the weak coupling picture of\n8\nBe(2+ ) \u00d7 \u039b (spin S = 1/2). From a theoretical point\nof view, this is the simplest non-trivial system which requires the Faddeev formalism with two identical particles,\ninvolving three Pauli-forbidden states between two clusters. Several model calculations were already done with\nvarious frameworks and two-body potentials. Hiyama et\nal. [7] used the OCM for the \u03b1\u03b1, 3\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\u039b systems\nand discussed not only the ground state of 9\u039b Be, but also\nthe spin-orbit splitting of the 5/2+ and 3/2+ states [32].\nThey employed simple three-range Gaussian potentials\nfor the \u039bN interaction [33] based on G-matrix calculations of various Nijmegen and J\u00fclich Y N one-bosonexchange-potential (OBEP) models. The \u039b\u03b1 potentials\nare generated from these \u039bN effective potentials by the\nfolding procedure with respect to the (0s)4 h.o. wave\nfunction of the \u03b1 cluster. They introduced a three-\u03b1 force\nand adjusted the Y N parameters to reproduce the binding energies of the 12 C and 9\u039b Be ground states. Filikhin\nand Gal [34] used the Faddeev and Faddeev-Yakubovsky\nformalisms to calculate the 9\u039b Be and 10\n\u039b\u039b Be ground states.\nThey used the Ali-Bodmer \u03b1\u03b1 potential [12] and the socalled Isle potential [35] for the \u039b\u03b1 interaction. They\nincluded only S-wave in the calculation, and reproduced\nthe 9\u039b Be ground-state energy correctly. However, if one\nincludes higher partial waves the Ali-Bodmer \u03b1\u03b1 potential yields overbinding for 9\u039b Be by more than 0.5 MeV.\nOryu et al. [36] carried out a \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculation\nby using the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel and various types of \u039b\u03b1\npotentials in the separable expansion method. Their energy spectrum of 9\u039b Be is reasonable, but the treatment\nof the two-\u03b1 Pauli principle in the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b system is only\napproximate. Since they neglected the Coulomb force, a\n\ndetailed comparison between their calculated results and\nexperiment is not possible. Cravo, Fonseca, and Koike\n[37] performed \u03b1\u03b1\u039b and \u03b1\u03b1n Faddeev calculations by using many \u03b1\u03b1 and \u039b\u03b1 potentials with the Coulomb force\nincluded between the two \u03b1 particles. From the comparison of the results for the 9\u039b Be and 9 Be systems, they\nfound an interesting sign change of the quadrupole moments and the magnetic moments for some excited states.\nThey also pointed out a possibility of negative parity resonances with 5\u039b He + \u03b1 cluster structure in this threshold\nregion.\nOur purpose for the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations using\n\u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernels is threefold. First, we develop a general three-cluster Faddeev formalism with two identical\nclusters, in order to apply it to more complex threecluster systems like the hypertriton interacting via quarkmodel baryon-baryon interactions. In the hypertriton\nsystem, we have to deal with the \u039bN N -\u03a3N N coupledchannel system which involves a Pauli-forbidden state at\nthe quark level in the \u039bN -\u03a3N subsystem. Since the\nbaryon-baryon interactions in the quark model are formulated in the two-cluster RGM formalism, the present\nthree-cluster formalism is most appropriate to correlate\nthe baryon-baryon interactions with the structure of fewbaryon systems. The second purpose is to make a consistent description of the \u03b1\u03b1, 3\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\u039b systems using\neffective N N and \u039bN interactions. This attempt is beyond the scope of the usual OCM framework and the Faddeev formalism assuming only inter-cluster potentials. A\ncomparison of the present 3\u03b1 results with the fully microscopic 3\u03b1 RGM or GCM [38\u201340] is useful to examine\nthe approximations involved in the present three-cluster\nformalism. The third purpose is to present a tractable effective \u039bN force for cluster calculations of various p-shell\nhypernuclei, which is not purely phenomenological but\nderived microscopically from quark-model baryon-baryon\ninteractions. In particular, this effective \u039bN force should\nbe able to reproduce the correct \u039b-separation energy of\n5\n5\n\u039b He; B\u039b (\u039b He) = 3.12\u00b10.02 MeV. Such a \u039b\u03b1 interaction\nis indispensable for, e.g., a \u039b\u039b\u03b1 Faddeev calculation using the quark-model \u039b\u039b interaction [41]. In this paper,\nwe derive an effective \u039bN force of two-range Gaussian\nform from the phase-shift behavior of the quark-model\nY N interaction, fss2, by using an inversion method based\non supersymmetric quantum mechanics [42].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section,\nthe three-cluster Faddeev formalism with two identical\nclusters is given, together with expressions to calculate\nthe expectation values of the two-cluster Hamiltonian\nwith respect to the solutions resulting from the Faddeev\nequation. The procedure to calculate the \u039b\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\nT -matrices is also discussed, as well as the treatment of\nthe cut-off Coulomb force employed in this paper. In the\nthird section, we first briefly discuss the results of the 3\u03b1\nFaddeev calculation, and then those of the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev\ncalculation. The final section is devoted to a summary.\nAppendix A gives a brief comment on the rearrangement\nfactors of three-body systems with two identical parti-\n\n\f3\ncles. The most general case with explicit spin-isospin\ndegrees of freedom is discussed. In Appendix B, we derive a compact formula to calculate the \u039b\u03b1 Born kernel\nfor arbitrary types of \u039bN interactions. Energies are in\nMeV and lengths in fm throughout.\nII.\nA.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nFaddeev equation for systems with two identical\nclusters\n\nIn order to formulate the Faddeev equation for systems\nwith two identical particles, we follow the notation of\nRefs. [43, 44] as much as possible. The Jacobi-coordinate\nvectors are specified by the permutation (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3), which is a\ncyclic permutation of (123). For example, the momentum\nvectors for the coordinate system \u03b3 in the unit of ~ are\ndefined by\nm\u03b2 k \u03b1 \u2212 m\u03b1 k \u03b2\n,\nm\u03b1 + m\u03b2\n1\n[(m\u03b1 + m\u03b2 ) k\u03b3 \u2212 m\u03b3 (k\u03b1 + k\u03b2 )] ,\nq\u03b3 =\nM\nP = k \u03b1 + k\u03b2 + k\u03b3 ,\np\u03b3 =\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k\u03b1 , k\u03b2 , k\u03b3 are single particle momenta of particles\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 with the masses m\u03b1 , m\u03b2 , m\u03b3 , respectively, and\nM = m\u03b1 +m\u03b2 +m\u03b3 is the total mass. Three different sets\nof the Jacobi coordinates, (p1 , q 1 ), (p2 , q 2 ), and (p3 , q 3 ),\nare related to each other in the standard relationship for\nthe rearrangement. We choose the coordinate system \u03b3 =\n3 as the standard set of Jacobi coordinates and assume\nthat particles 1 and 2 are the two identical particles with\na common mass m1 = m2 . We incorporate the symmetry\nproperty for the exchange of particles 1 and 2 into the\nFaddeev formalism by assuming the total wave function\n\u03a8(p, q) as\n\u03a8(p3 , q 3 ) = \u03c8(p3 , q 3 ) \u00b1 \u03c6(\u2212p1 , q 1 ) + \u03c6(p2 , q 2 )\nwith\n\u03c8(\u2212p3 , q 3 ) = \u00b1\u03c8(p3 , q 3 ) ,\n(2)\n\nwhere the upper (lower) sign is applied for identical bosons (fermions). The requirement \u03a8(\u2212p, q) =\n\u00b1\u03a8(p, q) is satisfied from this ansaz.\n\nIn the application to the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b system, two \u03b1 clusters\nare numbered 1 and 2, and the \u039b hyperon is numbered\n3. Since the technique to handle the rearrangement of\nthe Jacobi coordinates in the Faddeev formalism is well\nknown [43], we only give the specification scheme of channels and the final Faddeev equation after partial-wave\ndecomposition. We give expressions both in the LScoupling and jj-coupling schemes for later convenience.\nFor the 9\u039b Be system, the \u03b3 channel is specified by \u03b3 = 3\nwith (\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2) = (312) in Eq. (1). A set of quantum numbers in the \u03b3-channel is specified by \u03b3 = [(\u03bbl)L1/2]JJz\nin the LS-coupling scheme and [\u03bb(l1/2)j]JJz in the jjcoupling scheme with the angular-spin wave functions\nb |\u03b3i = \u03c6\u03b11 \u03c6\u03b12\nhb\np3 , q\n( 3\nb3 ) \u03be 12 (3)]JJz (LS-coupling)\n[Y(\u03bbl)L (b\np3 , q\n(3)\n\u00d7\n[Y\u03bb (b\np3 )[Yl (b\nq 3 ) \u03be 21 (3)]j ]JJz (jj-coupling) .\n\nb) = [Y\u03bb (b\np, q\np)Yl (b\nq )]LLz , \u03be 12 (3) is the spin\nHere, Y(\u03bbl)LLz (b\nwave function of \u039b, and \u03c6\u03b1 is the internal wave function\nof the \u03b1 particle. Similarly, we define the \u03b2 channel by\n\u03b2 = 2 with (\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1) = (231), and a set of quantum numbers\n\u03b2 = [(l1 l2 )L1/2]JJz (LS-coupling) and [(l1 1/2)Il2 ]JJz\n(jj-coupling) with\nb |\u03b2i = \u03c6\u03b11 \u03c6\u03b12\nhb\np2 , q\n( 2\nb2 ) \u03be 12 (3)]JJz\n(LS-coupling)\n[Y(l1 l2 )L (b\np2 , q\n(4)\n\u00d7\nq 2 )]JJz (jj-coupling) .\np2 ) \u03be 12 (3)]I Yl2 (b\n[ [Yl1 (b\nThe \u03b1 channel is specified by \u03b1 = 1 with (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) = (123),\nand the quantum numbers similar to those of the \u03b2 channel.

Suppose \u03a8 be a sum of three Faddeev components, \u03a8 = \u03c8\u03b1 + \u03c8\u03b2 + \u03c8\u03b3 .

In the 3 S1 state, only the low-energy\nregion is fitted, since the cusp region cannot be fitted in a\nsingle-channel calculation. This potential overestimates\nthe 3 S1 phase shift in the higher energy region. The\nprocedure to calculate the \u039b\u03b1 Born kernel for the simple\n(0s)4 \u03b1-cluster wave function is discussed in Appendix\nB.

The explicit functional form of\nVld (qf , qi ; \u03bai ) and Vle (qf , qi ; \u03bai ) are given in Eq. (B11).\nIn this paper, we also examine the \u039bN effective forces\n[33] used by Hiyama et al. [7] for comparison. These\npotentials are generated from the G-matrix calculations\nof various OBEP potentials.

Table\n\n\f7\nTABLE II: Bound-state energies for the \u039b\u03b1 system, E(5\u039b He)\n(in MeV), calculated by the original SB potential with f =\n1. The h.o. width parameters, \u03bd = 0.275 fm\u22122 and \u03bd =\n0.257 fm\u22122 are assumed for the (0s)4 \u03b1-cluster. The experimental value is E exp (5\u039b He) = \u22123.12 \u00b1 0.02 MeV.\nu\n\n\u03bd = 0.275 fm\u22122\n\n\u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122\n\n1\n0.6\n\n\u22124.975\n\u22124.946\n\n\u22124.747\n\u22124.728\n\nII shows that the SB potential of Eq. (22) overbinds the\n5\n\u039b He energy by more than 1.6 MeV. It also shows that the\nu-dependence is very weak, which implies that 5\u039b He is an\nS-wave dominated system. It is well known that a central\nsingle-channel \u039bN effective force that fits the low-energy\n\u039bN total cross section and the ground-state energies of\n3\n4\n4\n5\n\u039b H, \u039b H and \u039b He always overestimates the \u039b He binding\nenergy by more than 2 MeV, due to a lack of \u039b-\u03a3 mixing and the tensor force [47\u201350]. In order to circumvent\nthis difficulty, we introduce a reduction factor f in the\nattractive part of the 3 S1 potential in Eq. (22) for the following Faddeev calculations. The choices f = 0.8821 for\n\u03bd = 0.275 fm\u22122 and f = 0.8923 for \u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 reproduce the desired value E(5\u039b He) = \u22123.120 MeV, when\nthe pure Serber type SB potential with u = 1 is used.\nThe \u039b\u03b1 bound-state energies predicted by the NS - JB\neffective \u039bN potentials deviate from the original fit in\nRef. [7] by 110 keV - 170 keV (\u22123.23 - \u22123.29 MeV).\nThis is because they used a slightly different expression\nfrom ours for the exchange term of the \u039b\u03b1 potential. For\nthe \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations using the Minnesota threerange force for the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel (\u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 ), we\nreadjusted the strength of the original NS - JB \u039bN potentials in order to fit the precise 5\u039b He energy, \u22123.120\nMeV. This is achieved by slightly (less than 0.36%) modifying the strength of the short-range repulsive term (the\nthird component) of the original G-matrix potentials.\nThe \u039b\u03b1 phase shifts are also calculated, although there\nis no experimetal information. The S-wave phase shift\nshows a monotonic decrease from 180\u25e6 , similar to Fig.\n9 of Ref. [36]. In the energy region Ec.m. (\u039b\u03b1) = 0 - 20\nMeV, the phase shifts of the higher partial waves rapidly\ndecrease, starting from 20\u25e6 - 30\u25e6 for the P wave. This\nimplies that the \u039b\u03b1 potential is very much of the Wigner\ntype, and our lack of knowledge of the \u039b\u03b1 interaction in\nhigher partial waves may not become a serious problem\nin the Faddeev calculations.\n\nD.\n\n\u03b1\u03b1 T -matrix and effective N N Potentials\n\nThe \u03b1\u03b1 T -matrices used for the 3\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations are generated from the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel\nwhich uses an effective N N potential similar to Eq. (21).\nIn the notation used in Ref. [51], the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel,\n\nV RGM (\u03b5) = VD + VD CL + G + GCL + \u03b5K consists of the\ndirect potential VD , the direct Coulomb potential VD CL ,\nthe sum of the exchange kinetic-energy and interaction\nkernels, G = GK + GV , the Coulomb exchange kernel\nGCL , and the exchange normalization kernel K. We have\nto eliminate redundant components from the energydependent partial wave T -matrices, T\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5), which\nsatisfy the Lippmann-Schwinger equation similar to Eq.\n(19). This is necessary only for the S-wave (\u03bb = 0) and\nD-wave (\u03bb = 2) components, for which there exist two\nand one h.o. Pauli redundant states, un\u03bb (p), respectively.\nHere, un\u03bb (p) are essentially the h.o. wave functions in\nthe momentum representation with the total h.o. quanta\nN = 2n + \u03bb = 0 and 2, satisfying Kun\u03bb = un\u03bb . They are\nexplicitly given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n1\nun\u03bb (p) = (\u22121)n \u221a\nRn\u03bb p,\n(26)\n4\u03bc\u03bd\n4\u03c0\nwith \u03bc = 2, in terms of the standard three-dimensional\nh.o. radial wave function Rnl (r, \u03bd) in the coordinate representation. The RGM T -matrices defined in Ref. [14]\nare calculated by\nTe\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5) = T\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5)\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010 2\n\u2032 2 ( P1\n2\n2\n\u03b3\n+\np\n\u03b3\n+\np\n2\n\u2032\n~\nn=0 un0 (p) un0 (p )\n+\n4MN\n(\u03b3 2 + \u03ba2 )\nu02 (p) u02 (p\u2032 )\n(\n0\nfor \u03bb =\n,\n(27)\n2\nwhere \u03b3 2 = \u2212(4MN E/~2 ) and \u03ba2 = (4MN \u03b5/~2 ).\nFor the higher partial waves with \u03bb \u2265 4, we define\nTe\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5) = T\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5). The RGM T -matrices in\nEq. (27) satisfy the orthogonality condition\n\nun\u03bb (p)\nZ\n4\u03c0 4MN \u221e \u2032 2 \u2032 e\nun\u03bb (p\u2032 )\n=\np dp T\u03bb (p, p\u2032 ; E, \u03b5) 2\n,\n3\n2\n(2\u03c0) ~\n\u03b3 + p\u2032 2\n0\n(28)\n\nfor n = 0, 1 (\u03bb = 0) and n = 0 (\u03bb = 2). Owing to\nthis relationship, we can prove the orthogonality of the\ntotal wave function Eq. (2) to the Pauli-forbidden states\nun\u03bb (p).\nFor the effective N N force, we mainly use the threerange Minnesota (MN) force [45] with the exchangemixture parameter, u = 0.94687, and the h.o. width parameter, \u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 , for the (0s)4 \u03b1-clusters. We\nalso use the two-range Volkov No. 1 (VN1) and No. 2\n(VN2) forces [52], in order to compare our 3\u03b1 results\nwith the microscopic RGM [38, 53] and GCM [39] calculations. The Majorana parameters m of the Volkov\nforces and the h.o. width parameters are m = 0.575\nand \u03bd = 0.2515 fm\u22122 for VN1, and m = 0.59 and\n\u03bd = 0.275 fm\u22122 for VN2. The \u03b1\u03b1 RGM calculations using these effective N N forces and the complete Coulomb\n\n\f8\nkernel reasonably reproduce the empirical \u03b1\u03b1 phase shifts\nof the S-, D-, and G-waves, as well as the S-wave resonance near the \u03b1\u03b1 threshold. However, the best fit to the\nexperiment is obtained by the three-range MN force. For\nthe VN2 force, the S-wave resonance appears as a bound\nstate with the binding energy B\u03b1\u03b1 = 245 keV. Although\nthe VN1 force reproduces this resonance, the overall fit\nto the \u03b1\u03b1 phase shifts is less impressive compared to the\nMN force. In the RGM calculation, the precise determination of the resonance energy is not easy even in the\ntwo-\u03b1 system, because of the presence of the Coulomb\nforce. In the present Lippmann-Schwinger formalism in\nthe momentum representation, the method by Vincent\nand Phatak [54] is used for solving the scattering problem with the full Coulomb force at the nucleon level. We\nfind that the 0+ resonance energy is 0.18 MeV and 0.14\nMeV for VN1 force and the MN force, respectively. This\nshould be compared with the experimental value 0.092\nMeV.\nFor the Coulomb force in the 3\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations, we use the cut-off Coulomb force at the nucleon\nlevel\nCL\nvi,j\n(r) =\n\n1 + \u03c4z (i) 1 + \u03c4z (j) e2\n* \u03b8(RC \u2212 r) ,\n2\n2\nr\n\nForce \u03bbmax\nVN1\n\nVN2\n\n\u03b52\u03b1\n\nE3\u03b1\n\nc(04)\n\n4\n\n9.657 (10.887) \u221210.751 (\u22125.206) 0.900 (0.879)\n\n6\n\n9.531 (10.779) \u221210.926 (\u22125.365) 0.896 (0.875)\n\n8\n\n9.530 (10.778) \u221210.927 (\u22125.366) 0.896 (0.875)\n\n4\n\n8.583 (9.608)\n\n\u221211.202 (\u22125.781) 0.826 (0.795)\n\n6\n\n8.449 (9.505)\n\n\u221211.415 (\u22125.967) 0.821 (0.790)\n\n8.447 (9.503)\n\n\u221211.417 (\u22125.969) 0.821 (0.790)\n\n8\n\n(29)\n\nwith the cut-off radius RC , although an exact treatment of the point Coulomb force exists for bound-state\nnuclear three-body problems with two charged particles\n[55]. Here \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step function. For the\nmost compact 3\u03b1 ground state, this approximation with\nRC = 10 fm is good enough to obtain 1 - 2 keV accuracy. The Coulomb exchange kernel for Eq. (29) is\ncalculated analytically. The partial-wave decomposition\nof the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel is carried out numerically using\nthe Gauss-Legendre 20-point quadrature formula, when\nthe Coulomb force is not included. When the cut-off\nCoulomb force with RC = 14 fm is employed, it is increased to the 30-point quadrature formula to obtain an\naccuracy within 1 keV for the exchange Coulomb kernel.\nThe direct Coulomb term is separately integrated with\nenough number of numerical integration points.\nIII.\n\nTABLE III: Results of 3\u03b1 Faddeev calculations, using the\n\u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel, with and without the Coulomb effect. The\nparenthesized numbers indicate the results when the cut-off\nCoulomb force with RC = 10 fm are included at the nucleon\nlevel. Partial waves up to \u03bbmax are included in \u03b1\u03b1 and (2\u03b1)\u03b1 channels. The heading \u03b52\u03b1 is the expectation value of the\ntwo-\u03b1 Hamiltonian with respect to the 3\u03b1 bound state solution, E3\u03b1 the 3\u03b1 bound-state energy, and c(04) the overlap\nbetween the 3\u03b1 bound-state wave function and the SU3 (04)\nshell-model configuration.

These n3 points for p > 6 fm\u22121 are, however, not\nincluded for solving the Faddeev equation, since it causes\na numerical instability for the interpolation. The momentum region q = 6 fm\u22121 - \u221e is also discretized by\nthe n3 point formula just as in the p discretization. We\ntake n1 -n2 -n3 =15-10-5 for the 3\u03b1 system and 10-10-5 for\nthe \u03b1\u03b1\u039b system, respectively, unless otherwise specified.\nThe modified spline interpolation technique developed in\n[56] is employed to generate the rearrangement matrices.\nFor the large-scale diagonalization of non-symmetric matrices, the Arnoldi-Lanczos algorithm developed in the\nARPACK subroutine package [57] is very useful.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTo solve the Faddeev equation, we discretize the continuous momentum variable p (q) for the Jacobi coordinate vectors, using the Gauss-Legendre n1 -point (n2 point) quadrature formula, for each of the three intervals of 0 - 1 fm\u22121 , 1 - 3 fm\u22121 and 3 - 6 fm\u22121 . The\nsmall contribution from the intermediate integral over\np beyond p0 = 6 fm\u22121 in the \u03b1\u03b1 T -matrix calculation\nis also taken into account by using the Gauss-Legendre\nn3 -point quadrature formula through the mapping p =\np0 + tan {\u03c0(1 + x)/4}. We need n1 \u2265 10 and n3 = 5, so\nthat 35 points are at least necessary to follow up the inner\noscillations of the two-\u03b1 bound-state wave function and\nthe necessary T -matrices for solving the Faddeev equa-\n\nA.\n\n3\u03b1 Faddeev calculation\n\nIn order to make sure that our Faddeev equation\nis solved correctly, we first carried out the standard\n3\u03b1-particle Faddeev calculation by using the angularmomentum dependent Ali-Bodmer potential of d type\n(ABd). We find that the 3\u03b1 energy, E3\u03b1 = \u22126.423 MeV\nwithout Coulomb force, is consistent with previous calculations [9]. Here, we used ~2 /M\u03b1 = 10.4465 MeV * fm2\nand e2 = 1.44 MeV * fm for comparison. When the cutoff Coulomb force is included, our value \u22121.527 MeV\nis 4 keV lower than the \u22121.523 MeV given in Table 1\nof Ref. [9]. This difference is due to a slightly different\n\n\f9\ntreatment of the Coulomb force between the two calculations. The small 3\u03b1 binding energy implies that the AliBodmer phenomenological \u03b1\u03b1 potential cannot describe\nthe ground state of 12 C with a compact shell-model like\nstructure.\nOn the other hand, the present 3\u03b1 model interacting\nvia the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel gives enough binding and a large\noverlap with the compact shell-model like component.\nTable III lists the results of such Faddeev calculations\nfor the ground state of the 3\u03b1 system with and without the Coulomb force. The \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernels are generated from the VN1, VN2, and MN forces. When the\nCoulomb effect is included, the cut-off Coulomb force\nwith RC = 10 fm is employed. In the last column in\nTable III, c(04) implies the overlap amplitude of the 3\u03b1\nbound-state function with the SU3 (04) shell-model configuration. We find that all three effective N N forces\nyield binding energies comparable with the experimenexp\ntal value |E3\u03b1\n| = 7.275 MeV, although the result of the\nM N force is a little too large. The dominant component\nof these 3\u03b1 ground states is the SU3 (04) shell-model\nconfiguration.\nIn Table IV we compare the 3\u03b1 ground-state energies\nE3\u03b1 , predicted in the present three-cluster Faddeev formalism, with those obtained by fully microscopic calculafull\n. We find that the present three-cluster equations, E3\u03b1\ntion gives 3\u03b1 energies which are only 1.5 - 1.8 MeV higher\nthan those of the fully microscopic 3\u03b1 RGM or GCM calculations. This implies that the three-cluster exchange\neffect, which is neglected in our three-cluster formalism,\nbut is present in the fully microscopic three-cluster RGM\nkernel, is attractive in nature, and is not as large as the\nrepulsive three-body force claimed necessary in the semimicroscopic 3\u03b1 models [2, 4]. This is mainly because the\n3\u03b1 model space used by these authors does not exclude\nthe 3\u03b1 Pauli-forbidden components accurately, unlike the\none used in the present Faddeev formalism.\nIn Tables III and IV, we also find that the three-range\nMN force gives a somewhat large overbinding of 2 - 4\nMeV, if the 3\u03b1 energy E3\u03b1 is measured from the 3\u03b1\n\nTABLE IV: Comparison of the 3\u03b1 ground-state energies, predicted by the present model (E3\u03b1 ) and by fully microscopic\nexp\nfull\ncalculations (E3\u03b1\n). The experimental value is E3\u03b1\n= \u22127.275\nMeV. The present model is the Faddeev calculation using the\n\u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel, including the cut-off Coulomb force with\nRC = 10 fm.

The decomposition of the 3\u03b1 energy to the\nkinetic-energy and potential-energy contributions in Table V implies that this overbinding is due to the large\ncancellation between these two contributions. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the \u03b1 clusters with\n\u03bd = 0.257\u221afm\u22122 (which gives the correct rms radius\nr\u03b1 = (3/4 \u03bd) = 1.48 fm [58] for the simple (0s)4 \u03b1cluster) give less binding in the framework of the orthogonality condition model (OCM) [8]. If the h.o. constant\nparameter \u03bd is small, a proper treatment of the \u03b1\u03b1 exchange kernel seems to be essential in order to obtain a\nlarge binding energy of the 3\u03b1 ground state. This is reasonable since the large overlap of two \u03b1-clusters implies\nthe importance of nucleon exchange effects.\nB.\n\n\u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculation\n\nFor a detailed description of the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b bound states in\nthe Faddeev calculation, it is important to make sure\nthat the result is converged with respect to the following\nthree conditions:\n1) convergence with respect to the momentum discretization points,\n2) convergence with respect to the extension of partial\nwaves included,\n3) convergence with respect to the cut-off radius RC ,\nwhen the cut-off Coulomb force is included.\nAmong them, the Coulomb effect is the most difficult,\nsince the T -matrix of the full Coulomb force is divergent\nat the diagonal part and the strong oscillation in the\nmomentum representation in the cut-off Coulomb case\ndoes not lead to the correct answer, unless the numerical angular-momentum projection of the \u03b1\u03b1 Coulomb\nkernel (especially the direct Coulomb term) is accurately\nperformed. As to the partial waves, we can easily enumerate all possible angular-momentum states of 9\u039b Be for\nthe L\u03c0 = 0+ ground state with J = 1/2 and the L\u03c0 = 2+\nexcited state with J = 5/2 and 3/2 in the LS coupling scheme. If no \u039b\u03b1 spin-orbit force is introduced,\nthe J = 5/2 and 3/2 excited states are degenerate and\nthe LS-coupling scheme is more efficient than the jjcoupling scheme to reduce the number of channels cou-\n\n\f10\npled in the calculation. In the following, the angularmomentum truncation is specified by \u03bbmax -l1 max values\nfor the \u03b1\u03b1 and \u039b\u03b1 pairs. For example, D-P in the\nground-state calculation implies a 4-channel calculation\nand G-G in the L\u03c0 = 2+ calculation a 19-channel calculation. The largest model space adopted is I-I, which is\nan 11-channel calculation for L\u03c0 = 0+ and a 28-channel\ncalculation for L\u03c0 = 2+ . Note that the variational calculation in Ref. [7] uses a rather restricted model space; i.e.\na three-channel calculation with \u03bbmax = 2 and l1 max = 0,\nalthough the meaning of angular-momentum truncation\nis a little different from ours. For the momentum discretization points, we find that the energy change due to\nthe increase of n1 -n2 -n3 is very much RC dependent. It\nis usually positive if we go from n1 -n2 -n3 =5-5-5 to n1 -n2 n3 =10-10-5 when the Coulomb force is not included, but\nit turns out negative when RC = 10 fm and 14 fm. This\nimplies that the Faddeev calculation without Coulomb\nforce usually overestimates the binding energy, if the\nnumber of momentum discretization points is not large\nenough. Since the cut-off Coulomb kernels are oscillating,\ntoo small a number of momentum discretization points\nsuch as in n1 -n2 -n3 =5-5-5 case is dangerous when RC is\nvery large like RC = 10 fm and 14 fm. The orthogonality to the Pauli-forbidden states also deteriorates when\nthe number of momentum discretization points is too\nsmall. The squared norm of the Pauli-forbidden components contaminating the total wave function is typically\n10\u22125 - 10\u22126 when n1 -n2 -n3 =5-5-5, but is improved to less\nthan 10\u221213 for n1 -n2 -n3 =10-10-5. In this paper, we will\nmainly show the results of n1 -n2 -n3 =10-10-5, since the\nenergy gain by further extension to n1 -n2 -n3 =15-15-5 is\nusually less than 1 keV, when the cut-off Coulomb force\nwith RC = 10 \u223c 14 fm is included.\nThe energy gain of the ground state, \u2206E, and that of\nthe self-consistent \u03b52\u03b1 value by the increase of the maximum angular-momentum values, \u03bbmax -l1 max , are shown\nin Table VI in the cases when we use the VN2 or MN\nforces for the \u03b1\u03b1 interaction and the SB force for the \u039b\u03b1\ninteraction. In these calculations the cut-off Coulomb\nforce with RC = 6 fm is employed. If the S-wave calculation is extended to include the D-wave, the energy gain is\nabout 1 MeV for VN2+SB and 1.2 MeV for MN+SB. The\nenergy gain mainly comes from the partial-wave component with l1 = l2 = 1 of the \u03b1 - 5\u039b He channel. The effect\nof the partial wave l1 = l2 = 2 is rather small; i.e., about\n50 (VN2) - 60 (MN) keV. Needless to say, the exact energy gain largely depends on the character of the \u039bN odd\nforce. The ground-state energy is further improved by 7\n(VN2) - 5 (MN) keV and 0.03 (VN1) - 0.0 (MN) keV,\naccording to the extension to the G- and I-wave, respectively. On the other hand, \u03b52\u03b1 is improved by 160 (VN1)\n- 281 (MN) keV, 5 - 6 keV and 0.5 - 0.6 keV, according\nto the extension to the D-, G- and I-waves, respectively.\nIn conclusion, partial waves up to the D-wave are sufficient within 10 keV accuracy. If we wish to have a 1 keV\naccuracy, we need to take into account at least up to the\nG-wave. This implies that the partial-wave truncation\n\nTABLE VI: Energy gain for the ground state (\u2206E) and that of\nthe self-consistent \u03b52\u03b1 value (\u2206\u03b52\u03b1 ) in keV, for the extension\nof the maximum angular-momentum values, \u03bbmax -l1max .

The energy increase\n(and the accumulated one) due to the increase of RC\nis also shown with the plus sign in the second (and the\nthird) row. We find that the ground-state energy E(9\u039b Be)\nincreases by 1.621 MeV when we move from RC = 0 to\nRC = 6 fm, which is larger than 1.127 MeV calculated\nfor the free two-\u03b1 bound state. This seems to be natural, since the two-\u03b1 subsystem is more compact in the\n9\n\u039b Be system. The energy increase in the self-consistently\ndetermined \u03b52\u03b1 values is 1.435 MeV, which is about 200\nkeV smaller than the energy increase in E(9\u039b Be), but is\nstill larger than in the free two-\u03b1 bound state by about\n300 keV. This observation is a good example that our\nself-consistent procedure of determining \u03b52\u03b1 is reasonably functioning. It is interesting to note that this large\nCoulomb effect in the three-body ground state; i.e., about\n1.4 times larger than in the two-\u03b1 system, is characteristic for the increase of RC from 0 to 6 fm. For the range\nfrom RC = 6 to 10 fm, just the opposite is true and the\nenergy increase in the three-body ground state (85 keV)\nis smaller than in the two-\u03b1 system (> 133 keV). This is\napparently because the free \u03b1\u03b1 relative wave function is\nmore widely spread than the correlated \u03b1\u03b1 relative wave\n\n\f11\nfunction in the 9\u039b Be ground state. The tendency of \u03b52\u03b1\nfalls just into the middle of these two extremes. By using\nthis feature, we can easily estimate the full Coulomb effect in the E(9\u039b Be) ground state. We find that the result\nwith RC = 10 fm is accurate within a 1 keV error both\nfor E(9\u039b Be) and \u03b52\u03b1 .

(30) for the MN force,\nwe find that the energy gain by the more attractive VN2\nforce is only 42 keV. This result is rather surprising, if we\nconsider that the VN2 force gives a two-\u03b1 bound state\nwith energy E2\u03b1 = \u2212245 keV. The \u039b\u03b1 interaction by the\nSB force is also more attractive than in the MN force\ncase due to the different choice of the h.o. width parameter \u03bd. In other words, the ground state energy of\n9\n\u039b Be is not much affected by the poor \u03b1\u03b1 and \u039b\u03b1 interactions, as long as we find a well converged value by\ntaking enough partial waves and a large number of momentum discretization points. On the other hand, the\n\u03b52\u03b1 and \u03b5\u039b\u03b1 values for the MN force are larger than\nthose for the VN2 force by almost 500 keV. This may\nbe related to the difference of \u03bd values in the two calculations. The smaller \u03bd value, 0.257 fm\u22122 , in the MN\nforce calculation means more extended \u03b1-clusters than\nin the VN2 calculation (\u03bd = 0.275 fm\u22122 ), which implies\nin turn that the relative wave functions in the 2\u03b1 and\n\u039b\u03b1 subsystems should be more compact in the MN case.\nThis can be confirmed by comparing the kinetic-energy\ncontributions in E(9\u039b Be), \u03b52\u03b1 and \u03b5\u039b\u03b1 in Eqs. (30) and\n(31). For example, the kinetic-energy contribution in \u03b52\u03b1\nis 13.64 MeV in the VN2 case, while in the MN case it\nhas a much larger value 19.46 MeV. The compactness\nof the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b relative wave function in the MN case is\nalso reflected in the fact that c(40) is larger in the MN\n\ncase, even though the binding energy is smaller. Comparing the result in Eq. (30) with the experimental value\nE exp (9\u039b Be) = \u22126.62\u00b10.04 MeV, we can conclude that the\nMN+SB combination overbinds the 9\u039b Be ground-state energy by 220 keV. This is partly because our SB potential\nis of the pure Serber type (u = 1). If we choose u = 0.82\nfor the SB force, the combination with the present MN\nforce and \u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 yields E(9\u039b Be) = \u22126.621 MeV.\nIn this case, the 5\u039b He bound-state energy is \u22123.105 MeV.\nWe list the results of various \u039bN effective forces used\nby Hiyama et al. in Table VIII, when they are used in\ncombination with the MN force for the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel.\nThe calculations are carried out with n1 -n2 -n3 =10-10-5,\nRC = 10 fm, and the partial waves up to the G-wave, to\nobtain the converged results with the accuracy of 1 - 2\nkeV.\nTable IX lists \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations for the 2+\nexcited state, including the cut-off Coulomb force with\nRC = 14 fm. The momentum discretization points with\nn1 -n2 -n3 =10-10-5 are employed. When the partial waves\nare restricted to D-S or S-D, the 2+ -state energy is located above the \u03b1 + 5\u039b He threshold with the threshold\nenergy \u22123.12 MeV. The listing therefore starts from the\n7-channel calculation with D-P. We find that the result\nis almost converged with I-I and RC = 14 fm, within the\naccuracy of 1 keV.

Table X also shows a comparison with the results by Hiyama et al. [7] for the G-matrix\nbased effective \u039bN forces. We find that their results\nare a little lower than our results by about 70 - 90 keV.\nSince their calculation is a variational calculation using a\nsmaller model space than ours, this is not a convergence\nproblem of the variational calculation. A possible reason\nis the difference between OCM and RGM in the \u03b1\u03b1 part.\nThey used \u03b1\u03b1 OCM, while ours is \u03b1\u03b1 RGM. The OCM\nusually gives more attractive results than the RGM. In\nfact, it is well known that 3\u03b1 OCM usually gives a larger\nbinding energy than the 3\u03b1 RGM for the ground state of\nthe 3\u03b1 system [59]. A small difference in the exchange\nterm of the \u039b\u03b1 folding potential may also contribute to\nthis difference.\nIf we arrange the effective \u039bN forces in Table X in the\norder of more attractive nature, we find\nND (\u22127.483) > NF (\u22126.906) > SB (\u22126.837)\n> NS (\u22126.742) > JA (\u22126.677) > JB (\u22126.474) .\n(33)\n\n\f13\n+\n\nTABLE X: Summary of the ground-state energy Egr (0 ) and\nthe 2+ excitation energy Ex (2+ ) in MeV, calculated by solving\nthe Faddeev equation for the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b system in the LS coupling\nscheme.

However, this does not mean that the\nJ\u00fclich potentials JA and JB are the most correct \u039bN\ninteractions. It is well known that the spin-spin central\nterms of these J\u00fclich potentials are completely wrong and\nthat they fail to reproduce the observed energy spectrum\nof the 4\u039b H and 4\u039b He systems [60]. As for the 2+ excitation\nenergy, all the results in Table X are between 2.90 - 2.93\nMeV. They are too small by 110 - 130 keV with respect\nto the average value 3.04 MeV of the two resonances recently observed by \u03b3-ray spectroscopy [30, 31]. Since the\nexperimental error bars are at most \u00b140 keV even in the\n(K, \u03c0) reaction [26], this is a meaningful disagreement.\nIt would be interesting to examine the ls splitting of the\n5/2+ - 3/2+ states, by introducing a small \u039bN spin-orbit\nforce predicted by our quark-model interaction.\nIn order to show that the present \u03b1\u03b1 RGM kernel gives\na better result than simple \u03b1\u03b1 potentials, we show in Table XI some results of \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations using the\nAli-Bodmer potential, ABd [12], and the Buck, Friedrich,\nand Wheatley potential, BFW [11]. In these cases, there\nneeds no self-consistent procedure to determine \u03b52\u03b1 . We\nonly use the SB potential for the \u039b\u03b1 interaction, since\nresults with other effective \u039bN forces are easily evaluated from the above discussion in the case of the \u03b1\u03b1\nRGM kernel. In these \u03b1-particle models, we customarily\nuse ~2 /M\u03b1 = 10.4465 MeV * fm2 and e2 = 1.44 MeV * fm.\nThe momentum discretization points with n1 -n2 -n3 =1510-5 are employed. For the \u03b1\u03b1 Coulomb potential, the\nfolding potential of the cut-off Coulomb force with the\n(0s)4 shell-model wave function is used with RC = 10 fm.\nThe h.o. width parameter of the (0s)4 \u03b1-cluster for this\nGaussian folding is \u03bd = 0.27127 fm\u22122 in the ABd case\nand \u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 in the BFW case. In the ABd case,\nthis \u03bd value\n\u221a corresponds to the Coulomb-force parameter \u03b2 = 3/(2 \u00d7 1.44) = 0.6014 fm\u22121 and the \u03b1 rms\n\n\u221a\nradius, r\u03b1 = (3/4 \u03bd) = 1.44 fm. Since this \u03bd value\nis also used for the \u03b1-cluster folding for the \u039bN potential, the \u039b\u03b1 bound-state energy E(5\u039b He) is a little shifted\nfrom the fitted experimental value \u22123.12 MeV. [The different ~2 /MN value also affects this difference.] Since\nthe energy change is only about 0.06 MeV, we do not\nreadjust the potential parameters of the \u039bN force. In\nthe BFW\n0.257 fm\u22122 , corresponds to\np case, the \u03bd value,\n\u22121\nfm and the rms radius of the\n\u03b2 = 4\u03bd/3 = 0.58538\n\u221a\n\u03b1-cluster, r\u03b1 = 3/(2\u03b2) = 1.48 fm. In this case the difference of the \u039bN bound-state energy, 0.054 MeV, from\n\u22123.12 MeV is solely from the different ~2 /MN value. The\nbound-state solutions of the BFW potential are used for\nthe pairwise Pauli-forbidden states. The elimination of\nthe Pauli-forbidden components from the three-body total wave function is always inspected by calculating their\nsquared norm, which is of the order of 10\u221213 .\nWe find that the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b ground-state energy by the ABd\npotential is lower than the result of the MN force in\nEq. (30) by 0.3 MeV. Note that even in this case the\nenergy gain from the higher partial waves than the S\nwave is appreciable, i.e., 0.7 MeV. This implies that the\nS-wave assumption adopted by Filikhin and Gal [34] is\nnot valid. They used a little different version of the AliBodmer potential (type (a) with 125 MeV modified by\n\nTABLE XI: \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculations for the L\u03c0 = 0+\nground state by the Ali-Bodmer (ABd) [12] and Buck,\nFriedrich, and Wheatley (BFW) [11] \u03b1\u03b1 potentials. The SB\n\u039bN force is used for the \u039b\u03b1 interaction. The cut-off Coulomb\nforce is included at the nucleon level with RC = 10 fm. The\nh.o. width parameters of the \u03b1-clusters are assumed to be\n\u03bd = 0.27127 fm\u22122 (ABd) and \u03bd = 0.257 fm\u22122 (BFW).

In this case we find that the effect of partial\nwaves higher than the S wave is quite appreciable, i.e.,\n\u22121.5 MeV. This is of course due to the inner oscillation\nof the relative wave function between the two \u03b1-clusters\nin the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b ground state.

In this paper, we have\napplied this formalism to three-cluster systems involving\n\u03b1-clusters; i.e., the 3\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03b1\u039b systems. These systems\ninvolve all of the above three features for the microscopic\ninteractions between composite particles. In particular,\nthe \u03b1\u03b1 interaction is a prototype of composite-particle\ninteractions, in which the fully microscopic RGM calculation is easy and very successful. It, however, involves a somewhat complex kernel structure composed of\nthree non-trivial Pauli-forbidden states, and the energydependence of the interaction is rather strong in the\nPauli-allowed model space. In the present Faddeev formulation, the Pauli-forbidden components between pairwise clusters are completely eliminated from the total\nwave function of the three clusters. This can be achieved\nby introducing a special type of RGM Te-matrix calculated from the two-cluster RGM kernel, which satisfies\nthe T -matrix version of the orthogonality conditions to\nthe relative motion between two clusters. The on-shell\nand half off-shell properties of the Te-matrix are just the\nsame as those of the ordinary T -matrix. This RGM Tematrix involves a relative energy of two clusters as a parameter, which is determined self-consistently by calculating the expectation value of the two-cluster Hamiltonian with respect to the total wave function resulting\nfrom the Faddeev equation. The Faddeev equation using Te-matrices is equivalent to the pairwise orthogonality\ncondition model (OCM) of three-cluster systems, interacting via two-cluster RGM kernels. A nice point of this\nformalism is that the underlying nucleon-nucleon (N N )\nand hyperon-nucleon (Y N ) interactions are more directly\nrelated to the structure of three-cluster systems than in\nthe models assuming simple two-cluster potentials.\n\nWe have first applied the present formalism to the\nground state of the 3\u03b1 system by using three different\ntypes of effective N N forces, the two-range Volkov forces,\nNo. 1 (VN1) and No. 2 (VN2), and the three-range Minnesota (MN) force. The three-range MN force reproduces\nthe S-, D- and G-wave \u03b1\u03b1 phase shifts quite well in\nthe simple (0s)4 -model of the \u03b1 clusters. The comparison with the 3\u03b1 RGM calculation has shown that the\npresent three-cluster formalism using only the \u03b1\u03b1 RGM\nkernel gives a good approximation to the microscopic 3\u03b1\nmodel. The difference of the ground-state energies predicted by these two models is less than 2 MeV. The effect\nof the antisymmetrization among three \u03b1-clusters, which\nis neglected in our formulation, is attractive and is not\nso large, as long as the Pauli-allowed model space of the\n3\u03b1 system is properly treated. It is also shown that the\nthree-range MN force gives a lower ground-state energy\nthan the two-range VN1 and VN2 forces, resulting in\na somewhat large overbinding of 2 - 4 MeV, if the 3\u03b1\nground-state energy is measured from the 3\u03b1 threshold.\nThe application to the 9\u039b Be system has proved that\nour three-cluster formalism is soundly extended to the\nsystems with two identical clusters, in addition to the\nsystems of three identical clusters like the 3\u03b1 system and\nthe triton system. Here we have introduced a new effective \u039bN force, called the SB force, which is made\nfrom the quark-model predictions of the \u039bN phase shifts\nby using an inversion method based on supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics [42]. The SB force consists of two\nsimple two-range Gaussian potentials which reproduce\nthe low-energy behavior of the 1 S0 and 3 S1 \u039bN phase\nshifts predicted by \u039bN -\u03a3N coupled-channel RGM calculations using the model fss2 [46]. Since any central\nand single-channel effective \u039bN force leads to the wellknown overbinding problem of 5\u039b He by about 2 MeV [50],\nthe attractive part of the 3 S1 \u039bN potential is reduced by\nabout 10 % to reproduce the empirical \u039b-separation energy, B\u039bexp (5\u039b He) = 3.12 \u00b1 0.02 MeV. The odd-state \u039bN\nforce is assumed to be zero (pure Serber type). In addition to this SB force, we have also used the effective \u039bN\nforces in Ref. [7] for comparison. The \u039b\u03b1 interactions are\ngenerated from these \u039bN effective forces by the folding\nprocedure with respect to the (0s)4 h.o. wave function of\nthe \u03b1 clusters.\nIn the \u03b1\u03b1\u039b Faddeev calculation, enough partial waves\nup to \u03bbMax = l1 Max = 6 are included both in the \u03b1\u03b1 and\n\u039b\u03b1 pairs since the relative wave functions between two\n\u03b1-clusters are oscillating at least in the relative S- and\nD-waves. The detailed analysis shows that the partial\nwaves up to the D-wave are sufficient if we do not mind\na 10 keV inaccuracy. If we wish to obtain a 1 keV accuracy, we need to take into account at least up to the\nG-wave. This implies that the partial wave truncation is\nvery efficient even in the present Faddeev formalism. The\nenergy gain due to partial waves higher than the S-wave\nis about 1 MeV for the VN2 force and 1.2 MeV for the\nMN force, when these \u03b1\u03b1 interactions are used in combination with the SB force for the \u039b\u03b1 interaction. The\n\n\f15\nCoulomb effect between the two \u03b1-clusters is included\nby a cut-off Coulomb force at the nucleon level. The\ncut-off radius, RC = 10 - 14 fm seems to be sufficient\nfor a 1 - 2 keV accuracy. In the present formalism, the\nstructure change of two \u03b1-clusters inside 9\u039b Be is clearly\nidentified by calculating the kinetic-energy contribution\nin the two-\u03b1 expectation value \u03b52\u03b1 . The comparison of\nthe Coulomb contributions in the \u03b1\u03b1 bound state, \u03b52\u03b1\nand the 9\u039b Be ground state with respect to the change of\nRC is very useful to measure the compactness of the two\u03b1 configurations in various environments. It is confirmed\nthat the 0+ ground state and the 2+ exited state of 9\u039b Be\nare well described by the contracted two-\u03b1 cluster structure with a weakly coupled \u039b-particle in the dominant\nS-wave component. In the present calculation using only\ncentral forces, the three-range MN force and the SB potential with the pure-Serber character can reproduce the\nground-state and excitation energies of 9\u039b Be within an accuracy of 100 - 200 keV. The results in Ref. [7] based on\nthe OCM framework are also confirmed within 100 keV\naccuracy. On the other hand, the simple \u03b1-particle model\nusing the Ali-Bodmer \u03b1\u03b1 potential, ABd [12], and the\nOCM using the deep Buck, Friedrich, and Wheatley \u03b1\u03b1\npotential, BFW [11], with bound-state Pauli-forbidden\nstates give an overbinding of the 9\u039b Be ground state by\n530 keV and 420 keV, respectively, when the SB force is\nused for the \u039b\u03b1 interaction. Although these energies are\nrather similar, the effect of partial waves higher than the\nS-wave is very different; i.e., 0.7 MeV in the Ali-Bodmer\ncase and 1.5 MeV in the BFW case. It is natural that\nthe \u03b1\u03b1 interactions which yield an oscillatory behavior\nof the \u03b1\u03b1 relative wave functions, like our RGM kernel\nand the BFW potential, need more partial waves with a\nlarger energy gain.\nThere are still many problems left for the future studies. First of all, the readjustment of the 3 S attractive\npart of the SB \u039bN potential is unsatisfactory from the\nviewpoint of using the fundamental baryon-baryon interactions. The Brueckner rearrangement effect in 5\u039b He is\nfairly large even for the rather stable \u03b1-cluster [50]. In\nthis sense, there is still no consistent description of the\ns-shell and p-shell hypernuclei even at the level of using effective baryon-baryon interactions. A microscopic\ndescription of the \u039b\u03b1 interaction may need a more detailed analysis based on the G-matrix theory, for which\nthe folding formula given in Appendix B is very useful. In\norder to describe the 9\u039b Be excited states realistically, we\nneed to introduce the \u039b\u03b1 spin-orbit force and solve the\nFaddeev equation in the jj-coupling scheme. The recent\n\u03b3-ray spectroscopy experiment [30, 31] indicates a very\nsmall spin-orbit splitting for the possible 5/2+ and 3/2+\nresonances. It is interesting to examine the LS components of the quark-model \u039bN interaction, in which the\nantisymmetric LS interaction (LS (\u2212) ) is by about a factor two larger than in the Nijmegen models. We expect\na large cancellation between the ordinary LS interaction\nand this LS (\u2212) interaction. An interesting application of\nthe present Faddeev formalism and the \u039b\u03b1 T -matrix de-\n\nrived in this study is to the recent Nagara event [61] for\n6\n\u039b\u039b He. For the \u039b\u039b interaction, we can use the coupledchannel \u039b\u039b-\u039eN -\u03a3\u03a3 Te-matrix of the quark-model interaction, fss2. A preliminary result [41] shows that fss2 is at\npresent the only model which can reproduce an appropriexp\nate strength of the \u039b\u039b interaction, \u2206B\u039b\u039b\n= 1.01 \u00b1 0.20\nMeV, deduced from the Nagara event. In a separate paper [22], we will also report another application of the\npresent three-cluster Faddeev formalism to the hypertriton system, in which the quark-model N N and Y N\ninteractions are explicitly used in the \u039bN N and \u03a3N N\ncoupled-channel Faddeev formalism. In this system, a\ncomplete Pauli-forbidden state at the quark level exists\nin the \u039bN -\u03a3N subsystem.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (Nos. 15540270, 15540284, and\n15540292).

The incorporation of spin-isospin degrees\nof freedom is essential for further applications to the hypertriton system [22] and the \u039b\u039b\u03b1 system [41]. When\none uses the Dirac notation, it is important to fix a coordinate system of the representation. We choose the\nstandard system of the Jacobi coordinates with \u03b3 = 3,\nand introduce the Jacobi coordinates in the momentum\nspace, p = p3 and q = q 3 . The other Jacobi coordinates p1 , q 1 , etc. are similarly defined. For an arbitrary\nfunction \u03c8(p, q; 123) in \u03b3 = 3, the effect of the cyclic\npermutation P(123) of the symmetric group S3 is\nP(123) \u03c8(p2 , q 2 ; 312) = P(123) 2 \u03c8(p1 , q 1 ; 231)\n= \u03c8(p3 , q 3 ; 123) ,\n(A1)\nwhere 123 in \u03c8(p, q; 123) stands for the spin-isospin variables. For the transposition P(12) , Eq. (1) yields\nP(12) \u03c8(p3 , q 3 ; 123) = \u03c8(\u2212p3 , q 3 ; 213) ,\nP(12) \u03c8(p1 , q 1 ; 231) = \u03c8(\u2212p2 , q 2 ; 132) ,\nP(12) \u03c8(p2 , q 2 ; 312) = \u03c8(\u2212p1 , q 1 ; 321) .\n\n(A2)\n\nNote that the momentum suffix \u03b1 in p\u03b1 , q \u03b1 , and the\nsign of p\u03b1 , etc., are uniquely specified by the sequence\n\n\f16\nb2 |\u03b2i in Eq. (4) actually imof 123. For example, hb\np2 , q\nb2 ; 312|\u03b2i. In the following, we always use an\nplies hb\np2 , q\nabbreviated notation, \u03c8 = \u03c8(p3 , q 3 ; 123), in the standard coordinate system \u03b3 = 3. The total wave function,\n\u03a8(q 3 , q 3 ; 123), in Eq. (2) is then compactly expressed as\n\u03a8 = \u03c8 \u2212 P(12) P(123) 2 \u03c6 + P(123) 2 \u03c6 .\n\n(A3)\n\nIf we write the Faddeev equation in terms of \u03c8 and \u03c6, it\nreads\n\u0001\n\u03c8 = G0 Te 1 \u00b1 P(12) P(123) 2 \u03c6 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6 = G0 T P(123) \u03c8 \u00b1 P(23) \u03c6 ,\n(A4)\n\nwith Te = T12 and T = P(123) T13 P(123) \u22121 , where T12 and\nT13 are the two-body T -matrices in the three-body space.\n\nThe definition of the rearrangement factors in the\nDirac notation is based on the assumption\nhp3 , q 3 ; 123|P(123) 2 \u03c6i = P(123) 2 \u03c6(p3 , q 3 ; 123)\nZ\n= \u03c6(p2 , q 2 ; 312) = dp\u2032 dq \u2032 \u03b4(p\u2032 \u2212 p2 ) \u03b4(q \u2032 \u2212 q 2 )\n(\u03c3\u03c4 ) 2\n\n\u00d7P(123) \u03c6(p\u2032 , q \u2032 ; 123) ,\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere the function \u03c6(p3 , q 3 ; 123) is in Eq.

With this \u03c6 in the \u03b2 = 2 channel in mind,\nthe standard procedure of the partial wave decomposition\ngives the following definition for the first-type rearrangement factor g\u03b3\u03b2 (q, q \u2032 ; x):\n\nZ\nXZ\n1 1\n\u03b4(p \u2212 p1 ) \u03b4(p\u2032 \u2212 p2 )\n\u2032\nb; 123i\nhp, q, \u03b3|P(123) |p , q , \u03b2i3\u22122 =\ng\u03b3\u03b2 (q, q ; x) =\ndb\npdb\nq db\np\u2032 db\nq \u2032 h\u03b3|b\np, q\ndx\n2 \u22121\np\u03bb+2\np\u2032 l1 +2\n123\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nm3\nm2\n(\u03c3\u03c4 ) 2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb\u2032 ; 123|\u03b2i .\np\u2032 , q\n(A6)\nP(123) hb\nq \u03b4 p \u2212q\u2212\nq\n\u00d7 \u03b4 p+q +\nm2 + m1\nm3 + m1\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nHere, p1 and p2 are given in Eq.

The procedure to interchange these masses M\u039b and MN simultaneously like in\nRef. [7] leads to an erroneous expression [see Eq. (A.1)\nof [7]], which is apparently wrong since the RGM kernel\nP5\nh\u03b4(r \u2212a)\u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 | j=2 v1j |\u03b4(r \u2212b)\u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 i should not involve\nthe mass dependence. The correct expression is the one\nin which one sets MN = M\u039b in their Eq. (A.1) [see Eq.\n(B8) below]. The most general form of the two-body\n\u039bN matrix elements for the translationally invariant u is\nparameterized as\n\nfrom which the results in Eqs. (8) and (9) are easily obtained. Note that the rearrangement factor Eq. (A12) is\nsymmetric with respect to the interchange between p, q, \u03b2 and p\u2032 , q \u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 , since m1 = m2 .\n\nThe general procedure to calculate Born kernels of the\ns-shell clusters, developed in Ref. [62], can also be used\nto calculate the \u039b\u03b1 Born kernel\nV (q f , q i ) = heiq f r |V |eiq i r i\n= heiq f r \u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 |\n\n5\nX\nj=2\n\nv1j |eiq i r \u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 i ,\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1 is the internal wave function of the \u03b1 cluster,\n\u03be\u039b is the spin wave function of the \u039b particle and v1j is\nan effective \u039bN interaction. The essential part of this\nmethod lies in the correct treatment of the c.m. motion\nwhich is handled by the procedure given in Ref. [63]. This\nmethod makes it possible to deal with the most general\nform of the \u039bN interaction with non-static effects like the\nG-matrix \u039bN interaction. In this method, V (q f , q i ) in\nEq. (B1) is calculated from an integral form of the GCM\nkernel through\nV (q f , q i ) = h\u03b4(X G )eiq f r \u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 |\n\n5\nX\nj=2\n\nv1j |1 * eiq i r \u03be\u039b \u03c6\u03b1 i\n\nZ\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011 23 1\n( q f 2 +q i 2 )\n4\u03b3\n=\ne\nda db e\u2212iq f *a+iq i *b G(a, b),\n2\u03c0\n(B2)\nwith\nG(a, b) =\n\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011 23 Z\nG\n\ndR h\u03c8\u039b (a)\u03c8\u03b1 (0)|\n2\u03c0\n5\nX\nv1j |\u03c8\u039b (R + b)\u03c8\u03b1 (R)i .\n\u00d7\n\n(B3)\n\nj=2\n\nHere, \u03b3G = (4 + \u03b6)\u03bd, \u03b3 = 4\u03b6\u03bd/(4 + \u03b6) with \u03b6 = M\u039b /MN ,\nand \u03c8\u039b (R) and \u03c8\u03b1 (R) are the h.o. shell model wave functions of \u039b and \u03b1, centered at R, with the width parameters \u03b6\u03bd and \u03bd, respectively. First we calculate spatial\nintegrals for the spatial part u in v1j = u1j \u03c91j . These\nfour integrals with j = 2 - 5 are all equal because of\nthe antisymmetric property of the \u03b1 cluster. We need\nto calculate spatial integrals for u = u(x1 \u2212 x2 ) and\nu = u(x1 \u2212 x2 )Pr , which we call the direct term and\nthe exchange term, respectively. It is important to note\n\nhp1 p2 |u|p1 \u2032 p2 \u2032 i =\n\n1\n\u03b4(P \u2212 P \u2032 )u(k\u2032 , q \u2032 ; P ) , (B4)\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nwith p = (p1 \u2212 \u03b6p2 )/(\u03b6 + 1), P = p1 + p2 (also p\u2032 , P \u2032\nfor p1 \u2032 , p2 \u2032 ), and k\u2032 = p \u2212 p\u2032 , q \u2032 = (p + p\u2032 )/2. For the\nmatrix element Eq. (B4), the spatial part of the GCM\nkernel in Eq.
