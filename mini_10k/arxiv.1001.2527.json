Most\nof this research have been devoted to condensed matter systems, where the electron spin constitutes the spin\ndegree of freedom [2]. However, related or equivalent\nphenomena may occur by considering the polarization of\nlight [3] or internal Zeeman levels of cold atoms exposed\nto optical light fields [4] or spatially varying magnetic\nfields [5].\nIn many of the spintronics schemes developed in the\ncondensed matter community, a spin-orbit (SO) coupling\nplays a crucial role for the dynamics. The particular\nform of the SO coupling can be of either Rashba [6] or\nDresselhaus [7] type, both being frequently analyzed in\nterms of an effective gauge force [8, 9]. In other words,\none can interpret the SO couplings as giving rise to an\neffective spin-dependent Lorentz-type force. Thus, the\nSO coupling can serve as a spin-filter or a Stern-Gerlach\napparatus. As the manufacturing techniques improves,\nundesired effects deriving from crystal impurities can\nbe greatly suppressed and several successful experiments\ndemonstrating the SO coupling and its outings have been\nreported recently [10]. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices [11, 12] possess another possibility to implement\neffective SO couplings, and the study of it within a clean\nenvironment. While in condensed matter settings where\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jolarson@fysik.su.se\n\nthe coupling is an intrinsic property of the systems, for\ncold atoms it has to be externally created via spatially\nvarying laser fields.\nEver since the pioneering experiments on BoseEinstein condensation (BEC) [13], the field has witnessed\na tremendous progress both experimentally and theoretically [14]. The dispersive dipole coupling between light\nand atoms enables the possibilities to study matter waves\nin periodic potentials and the experimental realization\nof model systems discussed within theoretical solid state\nphysics [11]. Today, both the weakly interacting atomic\ngases as well as more strongly interacting ones can be realized experimentally. Furthermore, utilizing the internal\natomic hyperfine levels enable studies of the interplay between internal and external degrees of freedom [15]. One\ninteresting feature is the realization of artificial gauge potentials by means of coupling of internal atomic Zeeman\nlevels [16\u201319]. The technique of light induced gauge potentials allows for non-Abelian behavior to be analyzed\nand the SO couplings are one such example [20, 21].\nIn this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a spinor\nBEC subjected both to a two-dimensional weakly tilted\noptical square lattice as well to a set of spatially varying light fields giving rise to an effective SO coupling\nbetween the internal atomic states. Thereby, its dynamics will be driven by two mechanisms, namely; (i) Bloch\noscillations (BOs) arising due to the tilting of the lattice, and (ii) an intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) deriving from the effective SO coupling. The two phenomena\nmay be analyzed in terms of an extrinsic force along the\nlongitudinal direction of the lattice tilt and an intrinsic\ntransverse force. Being orthogonal to each other, these\n\n\f2\nforces render a complex correlated motion of the BEC in\nthe lattice potential. Furthermore, the particular form\nof the SO coupling renders Dirac cones characterized by\nlinear dispersions reminiscent of relativistic electrons. As\nan outcome of these, the evolution possesses as well a\ntrembling Zitterbewegung motion [22]. Normally, such effect damps out very fast [23], but we show that in a lattice situations as in the present paper it may indeed be\nlong-lived and hence more easily observable. Moreover,\nthe optical lattice can serve as trapping potential for the\natoms in the BO regime and no confining Harmonic trap\nis needed which would typically prevent buildup of spin\ncurrents [24].\nWhile SO couplings arise as an intrinsic property in\nmany crystals, in cold atom systems it has to be implemented externally. This, at the one hand may be a source\nfor experimental errors, but at the other it gives a handle\nfor the SO coupling; its strength and form can be tuned\nexperimentally. The same holds for the optical lattice,\nthe lattice strength and geometry are both control parameters, which has made it possible to observe BOs for\nBECs in optical lattices [25]. Due to the large atomic\nmass compared to the mass of the electron, Zitterbewegung is expectedly more clearly manifested in atomic systems. The first experiments detecting Zitterbewegung in\natomic systems were recently carried out [23, 26]. A different but related setup can be found in Ref. [5], where\na spinor condensate accelerating in a periodic magnetic\nfield was studied. We note that in Ref. [5], the spatially\ndependent magnetic field gives rise to an effective gauge\nforce. However, Bloch oscillations were not considered,\nand moreover, in the present work the periodic potential\nis external and independent of the SO coupling.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we\nintroduce the model system and outline how effective SO\ncouplings are rendered in such systems. To start with\nwe analyze the free case in which the problem is analytically solvable and demonstrate the SHE and the Zitterbewegung effect. Applying the acceleration theorem we\nalso solve the problem under constant acceleration. The\ndispersions, once an optical lattice has been included,\nare solved numerically displaying the Dirac cones. Section III presents the main analysis. The full numerical\nresults are presented, where we demonstrate the presence\nof a SHE and how it is modified by the longitudinal oscillatory motion. In particular, it is shown that the Hall\ncurrent will also oscillate, however with an increasing oscillation amplitude. On top of the oscillations deriving\nfrom the motion in a periodic potential, we find a persisting Zitterbewegung effect. Finally, we conclude with\na summary in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL SYSTEM\n\nRashba [6] and Dresselhaus [7] SO couplings appear\nin a variety of solids, ranging from semiconductors [27],\nthin magnetic films [28], to graphene [29]. The SO cou-\n\nplings bring about a degeneracy in the energy dispersions.\nAround these degeneracies, the dispersions are linear,\nreminiscent to that of relativistic particles, and therefore they are called Dirac cones. The relativistic properties have been confirmed experimentally in graphene\neither by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy or\nby considering the conductivity and cyclotron motion\nof electrons [30, 31]. The SO coupling and its corresponding degeneracy induces as well a non-trivial effective gauge structure, giving rise to phenomena such as\nthe intrinsic spin and anomalous Hall effects [8, 9]. In\nthe field of cold atoms, the first light induced effective\nmagnetic fields were demonstrated in Ref. [19], and signatures of non-Abelian structures were recently observed,\nsee [32] and reference therein. BOs with ultracold atoms\nhave already been realized experimentally by numerous\ngroups [25, 33]. We proceed by presenting a scheme which\nrealizes the desired SO coupling in an atomic tripod system.\nA.\n\nLight induced effective spin-orbit coupling\n\nThe idea of effective gauge potentials arising from adiabatic evolution dates back to the seminal works by Mead\non vibrations of molecules [34]. Berry [35] generalized\nthis finding by demonstrating the existence of an effective\ngauge structure in the context a quantum adiabatic evolution. Wilczek and Zee [36] further generalized Berry's\nresult and found an effective non-Abelian gauge potential accompanying adiabatic evolution of degenerate energy eigenstates. Dum and Olshanii [16] showed that\nthe effective gauge potentials can be generated in systems of ultracold atoms subjected to spatially dependent\nlight fields that couple internal atomic states. Following an approach for creating non-Abelian gauge potentials in time-dependent systems [37], Ruseckas et al. [17]\noutlined a scheme how to achieve effective non-Abelian\ngauge potentials by considering an atomic tripod system\nin spatially dependent light fields. The coupled four-level\nsystem possesses two degenerate dark states that, within\ncertain parameter regimes, can be decoupled from the\nremaining two bright states via standard adiabatic elimination. The flexibility of this tripod system, deriving\nfrom different laser configurations, allows for a variety\nof phenomena to be studied, such as, e.g., relativistic\nproperties [26, 38, 39], SHEs [40], novel phases of the\nBEC [41], and topological defects as effective magnetic\nmonopoles [42] or vortices [32].\nIn the present paper we consider a tripod setup similar to the one described in Refs. [20, 21]. The details\nof atomic and laser configurations rendering the gauge\npotentials can be seen in Fig. 1. The internal dynamics, is driven by three lasers that couple the three lower\natomic states |1i, |2i, and |3i to the excited state |0i.\nParameterizing the laser fields as \u03a91 = \u03a9 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6eiS1 ,\n\u03a92 = q\n\u03a9 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6eiS2 , and \u03a93 = \u03a9 cos \u03b8eiS3 , such that\n\u03a9 =\n\n|\u03a91 |2 + |\u03a92 |2 + |\u03a93 |2 , the two degenerate dark\n\n\f3\nthat we consider ultracold atoms so that excitations due\nto atomic motion can be neglected, the effective single\nparticle two-level Hamiltonian becomes in dimensionless\nvariables [20]\n\n2\n\n(0)\n\n\u0124eff = p\u03022x + p\u03022y + p\u03022z + \u03b40 \u03c3\u0302z \u2212 v0 \u03c3\u0302x p\u0302x \u2212 v1 \u03c3\u0302y p\u0302y ,\n\nFIG. 1: Atomic (a) and laser (b) configurations.

Provided the field amplitude \u03a9\nis much larger than the atom-light detuning \u2206 (as depicted in Fig. 1), the two dark states can be safely eliminated from the two bright states, resulting in an effective\ntwo-level system [17]. To derive an effective SO coupling\nbetween the two internal dark states |u1 i and |u2 i, we\nchoose S1 = S2 , S31 = vs y, \u03c6 = v\u03c6 x, and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0].\nThis can be achieved by coupling the two ground states\n|1i and |2i to the excited state |0i with two lasers intersecting with an angle \u03b6 and propagating in the xyplane. These lasers correspond to a standing wave in the\nx-direction and a plane wave in the y-direction. A third\nlaser, couples the states |3i and |0i, and is a plane wave\nin the yz-plane with an angle \u03be of propagation relative to\nthe y-axis. In terms of the angles \u03b6 and \u03be, and the wave\nnumbers kj = |~kj |, j = 1, 2, 3, we have\n\nS3 = k3 \u1ef9 cos \u03be,\n\nwhere \u03b40 is an effective Zeeman splitting, v0 =\n(v\u03c6 /2) cos \u03b8, v1 = (vs /2) sin2 \u03b8/2. The Pauli matrices \u03c3\u0302j , j = x, y, z, operate in the space spanned by\nthe dark states, i.e., \u03c3\u0302x = |u1 ihu2 | + |u2 ihu1 |, \u03c3\u0302y =\n\u2212i|u1 ihu2 | + i|u2 ihu1 |, and \u03c3\u0302z = |u1 ihu1 | \u2212 |u2 ihu2 |. The\np-dependence of the last two terms originates from nonadiabatic couplings [43]. We note that these do not include pz and as a consequence the z-dependence can be\nfully factored out. In Eq. (3), we have used dimensionless\nparameters. Explicitly, when we further on introduce a\nlattice potential whose wave number is k, we let the characteristic length scale be l = 2\u03c0k \u22121 and we let the characteristic energy scale be the recoil energy ER = h\u03042 k 2 /2m.\nConsequently, time t is measured in units of \u03c4 = h\u0304/ER .\nThe superscript (0) indicates the free Hamiltonian in absence of a spatially dependent optical lattice potentials.\nThe Zeeman shift \u03b40 splits the degeneracy of the two\ninternal states and together with the SO coupling it gives\nrise to a transverse current, an intrinsic anomalous Hall\neffect. We will, however, focus on the intrinsic SHE obtained when \u03b40 = 0. In this case, the transverse particle current vanishes but, on the other hand, a transverse spin current persists. The \u03b40 = 0 condition can\nbe achieved by internal Stark shift of the individual bare\natomic levels [20, 44]. Thus, in the following we will assume \u03b40 = 0, and furthermore we will also consider the\nsymmetric SO coupling characterized by v0 = v1 \u2261 vso .\nIt should be pointed out, however, that even by lifting\nthese constrains an interplay between transverse and longitudinal atomic motion will still occur.\nOne important prerequisite for successful application\nof the current scheme is that the system can be prepared\nin the dark subspace spanned by {|u1 i, |u2 i}. This issue\nhas been discussed in [45]. The idea is to slowly turn on\nthe external lasers \u03a9k , k = 1, 2, 3, such that the state follows adiabatically states in the dark subspace, preparing\na superposition of {|u1 i, |u2 i} but no bright state components.\nB.\n\nAnalytical results without a lattice potential\n\nWe note that we may rewrite the Hamiltonian in\nEq.

Although being constant\nin space, the vector potential gives rise to a non-trivial\neffective gauge field due to its non-Abelian structure,\n[\u00c2x , \u00c2y ] 6= 0. Explicitly, this effective field is given by\nthe antisymmetric field tensor\nF\u0302kl = \u2202k \u00c2l \u2212 \u2202l \u00c2k \u2212 i[\u00c2k , \u00c2l ], k, l = x, y,\n\n(7)\n\n1 2\n2 vso \u03c3\u0302z\n\nand F\u0302kl = 0 otherwise. As a\nresulting in F\u0302xy =\nresult, the spin-orbital motion of the electrons can be understood in terms of an effective Lorentz-type force, akin\nto that found by Wong [46] for a color-charged classical\nparticle moving in a non-Abelian gauge field. The corresponding force operator may be derived from Heisenberg\nequations of motion according to [47]\nF\u0302SO =\n=\n\n1 d2 r\u0302\n1\n= [\u01240 , [r\u0302, \u01240 ]]\n2 dt2\n2\n2\nvso\n(p\u0302\n\n(8)\n\n\u00d7 ez )\u03c3\u0302z ,\n\nwhere it is understood that the operators on the righthand side are all given in the Heisenberg representation\nand the prefactor 12 in front of the acceleration is the mass\nin the chosen units. Note that the force in the y-direction\nis proportional to \u2212p\u0302x and the force in the x-direction\nis proportional to p\u0302y . This demonstrates the transverse\ncharacter of F\u0302SO and its equivalence to a Lorentz or Coriolis force. The crucial aspect of Eq. (8) is, however, that\nthe force is state dependent: atoms in dark state |u1 i\nfeel a force with opposite sign compared to those in dark\nstate |u2 i. Therefore, the motion of the particles in the\nxy-plane may separate the two spin states implying that\na non-zero spin current is generated. In the following, we\nshall call the x-direction longitudinal and the y-direction\ntransverse.\nThe effect of the above Lorentz-type gauge force can\nbe examined by computing how the initial (t = 0) state\n\u03a8(px , py , 0) = \u03c81 (px , py , 0)|u1 i + \u03c82 (px , py , 0)|u2 i\n\n(9)\n\n(0)\n\nevolves in time under influence of \u0124eff . We assume that\nthe internal and momentum states of the atom are initially uncorrelated and that the initial momentum states\nare Gaussian wave packets of the form\n\u03c81 (px , py , 0) = \u2212\u03c82 (px , py , 0) = \u03c8(px , py )\n1\n\n= q\ne\n4\n4\u03c0\u22062p\n\n\u2212\n\n(px \u2212p0 )2 +p2\ny\n2\u22062\np\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u2206p sets the momentum uncertainty and p0 is the\naverage momentum along the x-direction. This choice\ncorresponds \u221a\nto the pure internal atomic state |\u2212i =\n(|u1 i\u2212|u2 i)/ 2. Given this initial state, the time evolved\nstate is readily obtained as\n\u03a8(px , py , t) = \u03c81 (px , py , t)|u1 i + \u03c82 (px , py , t)|u2 i(11)\n\nwith\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n\u03c81 (px , py , t) = \u221a cos(\u03bbt) + i sin(\u03bbt)e\u2212i\u03b8\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u00d7\u03c8(px , py )e\u2212i(px +py )t ,\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n\u03c82 (px , py , t) = \u2212 \u221a cos(\u03bbt) + i sin(\u03bbt)ei\u03b8\n2\n\u00d7\u03c8(px , py )e\u2212i(px +py )t .\n\n(12)\n\nHere, we have used the energy dispersions E\u00b1 and the energy eigenstates \u03c6\u00b1 of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3), which\nread\nE\u00b1 (px , py ) = p2x + p2y \u00b1 \u03bb,\n\u0001\n1\n|\u03c6\u00b1 i = \u221a \u00b1| \u2191i + ei\u03b8 | \u2193i ,\n(13)\n2\nq\nwhere \u03bb = vso p2x + p2y and tan(\u03b8) = py /px .\nIn Fig. 2 we display the dimensionless averages\nZZ\n\u2202\n\u03c8i (px , py , t)dpx dpy , (14)\nh\u0177ii = 2i\n\u03c8i\u2217 (px , py , t)\n\u2202py\nwith i = 1, 2. The factor 2 derives from normalization of the individual wave packet components. Since\nthe initial velocity is along the longitudinal x-direction,\nthe deviation from h\u0177ii = 0 is a direct consequence of\nthe state-dependent Lorentz-type gauge force F\u0302SO . Note\nthat h\u0177i1 = \u2212h\u0177i2 giving a vanishing transverse particle\ncurrent. This symmetry is broken by keeping the Zeeman term \u03b40 \u03c3\u0302z in the Hamiltonian of Eq. (3). The particle current induced by such a \u03c3\u0302z -term goes under the\nname intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. After t \u2248 20, the\nseparation of the two internal dark states has reached\nan asymptotic value. Until t \u2248 20, the transverse spin\ncurrent shows an oscillating behavior deriving from the\nsame mechanism as the one underlying relativistic Zitterbewegung in the Dirac equation [22]. In the Dirac equation the trembling motion describes coherent coupling\nbetween positive and negative energy solutions, while in\nthe present situation it describes population swapping\nbetween the internal states. In solids, the amplitude\nof these oscillations become extremely small due to the\nlightness of the electron, while in atomic or ionic systems\nthe heavier masses imply larger amplitudes and possible detection [23, 26]. Despite heavier masses, the rapid\ndamping of the trembling motion as depicted in Fig. 1\nis a limitation also in atomic/ionic Zitterbwegung experiments [23, 26]. In the next subsection we will argue how\nthis decay may be prevented by studying the effect in the\npresence of an optical lattice.\nIn order to generate a current in the system one applies a constant longitudinal force Fex ex , e.g., induced by\ngravitation in atomic systems. In the particular case of\nsolids, the force derives from a voltage across the solid,\nand the electrons reach a steady state motion in which\nthe applied force is balanced by scattering against crystal\n\n\f5\nwith the coupling between the two internal states. For\nspinless particles, the two forces render a spirally transverse motion and hence a net transverse current. For particles with spin-dependent Lorentz forces F\u0302SO one would\nexpect a net transverse spin current, but the coupled nature of the two spin states seems to destroy such spin\ncurrent in the case of constant acceleration.\n\ni=\u2191, \u2193\n\n1\n0.5\n\ni\n\n\u3008y\u3009,\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n0.6\n\u22121\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.4\n\ni=\u2191, \u2193\n\nt\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Time evolution of h\u0177i1,2 (green curve\ncorrespond to the dark state |u1 i and the red curve correspond to the dark state |u2 i) as defined in Eq. (14). The\ndimensionless parameters in Eqs. (3) and (10) are vso = 1\n(= v1 = v2 ), \u03b40 = 0, p0 = 1, and \u2206p = 0.1. The initial state\nis thus a Gaussian with a non-zero average momentum along\nthe x-direction.\n\nimpurities. On the other hand, a system of cold atoms\nis, to a good approximation, free from impurities and one\nwould therefore achieve constant acceleration. Assuming\nthat the force is weak and that the total time of evolution\nis relatively short, we can perform an adiabatic approximation, consisting in replacing px by px \u2212 Fex t in Eq.\n(12). Hence, the momentum grows linearly in time in\naccordance with classical motion. How this comes about\ncan be easily understood by considering the time evolution of the Hamiltonian \u0124 = \u01240 \u2212 Fex x\u0302 for small forces\nFex and times t. In this regime, the time-evolution operator can be approximated accordingly\n\u00db (t) = e\u2212i\u0124t \u2248 eiFex x\u0302t e\u2212i\u01240 t ,\n\n(15)\n\nso that the first exponential gives the coupled timeevolution while the second simply boosts the xmomentum by \u2212Fex t. For longer time periods, the large\nvelocity rendered by the acceleration will typically cause\nnon-adiabatic excitations, which we neglect for the moment. Similarly, for large values of Fex t, the factorization of the exponentials is no longer justified. The resulting averages h\u0177ii calculated within this approximation are depicted in Fig. 3. As before, we encounter a\nbuild-up of a transverse spin current but in this case the\ncurrent changes sign after some time and finally there is\nno net spin separation. By comparison with a full numerical integration of the Hamiltonian we find that the\nimposed adiabatic approximation breaks down after relatively short times. Nevertheless, numerically we have verified that the dynamics beyond this approximation goes\nas well asymptotically to zero for large times. We believe\nthat the origin of this result is a complicated interplay\nbetween the transverse and longitudinal forces, together\n\n\u3008 y \u3009i,\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nt\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Same as Fig. 2, but with a constant\nweak force of magnitude Fex in the x-direction added to the\nHamiltonian (3) and assuming the validity of the adiabatic\napproximation.

Insight\ninto the evolution behavior is gained by considering the\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian including a lattice potential\nwhile disregarding the linear force potential. Adding to\nthe SO Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) a spatially oscillating\nperiodic potential, yields\n\u0124 = p\u03022x + p\u03022y + vso (p\u0302x \u03c3\u0302x + p\u0302y \u03c3\u0302y )\n+V cos2 (x\u0302) + V cos2 (\u0177).\n\n(16)\n\nThe Hamiltonian is periodic and consequently possesses\na band-gap spectrum E\u03bd (kx , ky ) with associated Bloch\neigenstates u\u03bd,kx ,ky (x, y), characterized by a discrete\nband-index \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ... and quasi-momentum numbers (kx , ky ) restricted to the first Brillouin zone, i.e.,\n\u22121 \u2264 kx < 1 and \u22121 \u2264 ky < 1. A detailed study of Bloch\ntheory in the presence of SO couplings can be found in\nRef. [48]. The first two bands E1 (kx , ky ) and E2 (kx , ky ),\nobtained from numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, are shown in Fig. 4. A similar band structure\nhas been obtained in Ref. [39] for cold atoms in a square\noptical lattice. We directly see the effect of the SO coupling in terms of Dirac cones at (kx , ky ) = (n, m), where\n\n\f6\nn, m =, \u22121, 0, 1. It is further seen that the ground state\nis not the u1,0,0 (x, y) Bloch state, as for a regular square\nlattice lacking SO couplings. This fact is at the heart of\nthe Jahn-Teller effect [49], where the Dirac cone (or conical intersection as it is usually referred to when it appears\nin position space rather than in momentum space) induces a symmetry breaking that lowers the ground state\nenergy. Furthermore, we note that the two lowest bands\nare not gapped, while there is a gap between the second\nand third band. Indeed, due to the SO coupled two-level\nstructure of the Hamiltonian, the bands come in pairs\nwhere each pair possesses Dirac cones for quasi-momenta\n(kx , ky ) = (n, m). The effective number of Dirac cones\nis four (easily seen by shifting the Brillouin zone by 21 in\nboth directions), compared to two Dirac cones encountered in honeycomb lattices, like in graphene. We notice\nthat recently it was shown how more complex lattice potentials may render single Dirac cones within the first\nBrillouin zone [50].\n\n\u221212.08\n\nx y\n\nE (k ,k )\n\n\u221212.07\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u221212.075\n\n\u221212.08\n\n1\n0\n\nk\n\ny\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nk\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 4: The two lowest Bloch bands E\u03bd (kx , ky ) for a square\nlattice with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In this example,\nvso = 1 and V = 5.\n\nIn the adiabatic regime, a non-zero extrinsic force\nFex ex is treated by using the same approximation as\nabove, yielding\nu\u03bd,kx ,ky (x, y) \u2192 u\u03bd,kx \u2212Fex t,ky (x, y).\n\n(17)\n\nIn the presence of a periodic potential, this adiabatic\nassumption has become known as the acceleration theorem [51]. It implies that no population is transferred between the individual bands \u03bd. As a direct\nconsequence, an initial state with well localized quasimomentum within one single band will show an oscillatory motion rather than a constantly accelerating one,\nonce the extrinsic force Fex ex has been turned on. These\nare the well studied Bloch oscillations [52], which have\n\nbeen experimentally verified in a variety of systems, such\nas cold atomic gases [33], BECs [25], semiconductor superlattices [53], waveguide arrays [54], and photonic crystals [55].\nBOs are clearly an outcome of the periodic potential\nand its characteristic energy spectrum possessing gaps of\nforbidden energies at the center and edges of the Brillouin\nzone. As the amplitude of the potential V vanishes, the\ngaps close and the acceleration theorem breaks down. In\nparticular, for weak lattice amplitudes, the gap between\nthe first two energy bands scales as \u223c V . By linearizing\nthe dispersions around the band gap and replacing kx\nby kx \u2212 Fex t, one obtains a realization of the celebrated\nLandau-Zener model [56]. Here, kx is the initial quasimomentum in the x-direction. This model is analytically\nsolvable, giving the probability of population transfer between the two states of the corresponding bands. It has\nbeen shown that the decay of BOs can be correctly estimated using the Landau-Zener theory [25, 57].\nIn the present model, the situation becomes qualitatively different. At the Dirac points, the gap vanishes\nand the acceleration theorem cannot be imposed. However, from Fig. 4 it is seen that the Dirac cones appear\nbetween the first two bands, and not between the second\nand third band. Hence, assuming a state initially prepared on the lowest band one may expect predominant\npopulation transfer between the \u03bd = 1 and \u03bd = 2 bands\nand not to higher bands. Thereby, further acceleration is\nhindered by the gap between the second and third band\nand spin-dependent BOs may still be encountered. In\nother words, a modified acceleration theorem involving\npair of bands could result. In fact, as already mentioned,\nthe acceleration theorem is a specific example of the more\ngeneral adiabatic theorem, and in molecular and chemical\nphysics it has long been known that adiabaticity breaks\ndown in the vicinity of a conical intersection [58]. In this\ncontext, it should be kept in mind that adiabaticity is\na widespread concept in physics, and the general definition concerns systems whose dynamics is governed by an\nexplicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian. Adiabaticity, as\nit appears in the acceleration theorem, is in this sense\nmore reminiscent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [58], applicable to time-independent Hamiltonians\ndescribing light and heavy quantal degrees of freedom\ncorresponding here to the spin and the spatial motion,\nrespectively, of the particles.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nOur numerical analysis will be restricted to a system\nconsisting of weakly interacting atoms, for which a meanfield description is expected to capture the phenomena\nwe are interested in.

This\ndefinition of gi Rimplies that the wave function has been\nnormalized as |\u03a8(x, y, t)|2 dxdy = 1. In the basis of\ndark states, the scattering lengths are effective ones different from the regular hyperfine scattering lengths. Nevertheless, the ratio between the two scattering amplitudes\nshould approximately be the same regardless of basis,\nand, in particular, for a spinor condensate such as that\nof 87 Rb one has g11 \u2248 g22 \u2248 g12 [59]. We will restrict the\nanalysis to repulsive interactions, g12 , g22 , g12 > 0, and\nwe will furthermore assume g11 = g22 = g12 \u2261 g [59].\nIn the absence of a lattice, the SO coupling gives rise to\na non-Abelian Mead-Berry curvature [34\u201336], which results in a transverse splitting of spin components, the\nintrinsic SHE. However, in Figs. 2 and 3 the motion\nalong the longitudinal x-direction was either constant or\nmonotonously accelerating, while for a weakly tilted lattice, where BOs dominate the longitudinal motion, it is\nneither clear how the transverse spin current nor how the\ntrembling Zitterbewegung motion will be manifested. For\ninstance, will there be sufficient time for a transverse spin\ncurrent to be established within a single Bloch period?\nIn Ref. [60], the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect was studied in a single particle system confined by an harmonic\npotential and hence the motion was as well oscillatory as\nin the case of BOs. The transverse current appeared as a\nrotation on top of the harmonic oscillatory motion, i.e.,\nin polar coordinates (r, \u03c6) the gauge potential causes a\nnon-zero current in the \u03c6-direction. Such current would\nindeed be zero for an SO coupling possessing an Abelian\nstructure rather than non-Abelian, e.g. for couplings on\nthe form vso (\u03c3\u0302\u03b1 p\u0302x + \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 p\u0302y ) with \u03b1 = x, y, z. It is clear\nthat a corresponding rotational current cannot be strictly\nencountered in the present system since exact polar symmetry is broken by the tilting of the lattice and by the\nlattice in itself.\nThe time evolution of the system is solved by employing the split-operator approach [61]. The method relies\n\n\u0015)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n\n\u2202\n\u2212i \u2202x\n\u2212\n0\n\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n\n#\n(18)\n\n\u03a8(x, y, t).\n\non factorizing the time-evolution operator into a spatial\npart and a momentum part valid in the limit of infinitely\nsmall time-step propagation. One convenient feature of\nthis method is that the wave function is in principle obtained at any instant of time in both position \u03a8(x, y, t)\nand momentum \u03a8\u0303(px , py , t) space. Furthermore, for a\nsystem bounded from below, the approach is capable of\ngiving an approximate ground state of the system by simply propagating it sufficiently long in imaginary time.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Absolute value of the ground state\nwave function in momentum space (a) and (c), and in position\nspace (b) and (d). The dimensionless parameters are V = 5,\nFex = 0, and g = 1 for all plots, vso = 2 in the upper plots (a)\nand (b), and vso = 1 in the lower plots (c) and (d). Thus, the\nlower plots correspond to the dispersions depicted in Fig. 4.\n\nOur numerical considerations will focus on propagation\nof an initial (approximated) ground state for the untilted\n(Fex = 0) lattice. That is, we consider the ground state\nof a spin-orbit coupled BEC in an optical lattice, and\nthen we introduce a quantum quench by suddenly switch\non a linear force in the x-direction. Hence, we begin by\npropagating an ansatz function in imaginary time with\nzero extrinsic force Fex = 0. When convergence of the\nimaginary time evolution has been reached, we switch\nto real time propagation, including the extrinsic force by\nadding the potential term \u2212Fex x\u0302 to the Hamiltonian. As\npredicted by the acceleration theorem, for short times the\nweak forces Fex will induce a linear increase in the quasimomentum kx . In contrast to BOs in a regular square\n\n\f8\n\n\u3008y\u3009\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\u221210\n0\n\n(b)\n\u3008x\u3009\n\nlattice, here the SO coupling implies that also the quasimomentum ky is indirectly affected by the force Fex . At\nthe same time, the build up of motion in the y-direction\ninduces an intrinsic force FSO along the longitudinal xdirection of BOs. In addition, the linear dispersions induce a trembling Zitterbewegung motion. It is thereby\nlikely to expect a complex motion arising from the interplay between the two forces related to SHE and BOs and\nthe outcomes from linear dispersions.\n\n\u22125\n\u221210\n2\n\nFSO\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5 displays the absolute values of the initial\nground state wave function achieved via imaginary time\nevolution for Fex = 0. The momentum wave functions\ndepicted in (a) and (c) demonstrate the Jahn-Teller effect as the ground state populates non-zero momentum\nstates [49]. The lower two plots (c) and (d) correspond\nto the parameters of the two lowest Bloch bands shown\nin Fig. 4. The fact that the ground state obtained from\nthis numerical method is not symmetric, as seen from\nthe plots, is believed to have a two-fold cause. First, it\nseems to derive from the fact that the imaginary time\nevolution is taken only up to a point where the state\nevolution has approximately converged, and, secondly,\nfrom the fact that even small fluctuations can result in\nan asymmetric ground state, due the four-fold degeneracy of the ground state of our Hamiltonian. In fact, the\ncomplete convergence of the ground state has not been\nreached since the position space wave functions depicted\nin (b) and (d) are localized in contradiction to the true\nground state having a Bloch structure, and furthermore\nsince the momentum wave functions have a finite width.\nThis, however, should not be seen as a shortcoming since\nnormally one would cool the atomic gas in the presence\nof a confining potential which would result in a localized gas. In addition, if the propagated state extends\nover the full lattice one would run into troubles when\nquantities such as the mean spatial position is calculated\nnumerically. Note that the momentum wave functions of\n(a) and (c) are different from the quasi-momentum as is\nevident in the multiple Bragg components separated by\n\u2206px , \u2206py = \u00b11. In other words, even though the momentum wave functions extend beyond the first Brillouin\nzone, it populates, to a very good approximation, only\nthe lowest band. We also note that the position space\nground state wave functions, shown in (b) and (d), predominantly populate the individual lattice sites. Hence,\nonly judging from Figs. 5 (b) and (d) it would be difficult to predict the presence of a SO coupling and the\nDirac cones that derive from it, which instead manifest\nthemselves in momentum space in terms of a Jahn-Teller\neffect.\n\nIn order to analyze the interplay between the transverse and longitudinal forces, FSO and Fex ex , we calcu-\n\n0\n\u22122\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nt\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Average transverse position h\u0177i (a),\naverage longitudinal position hx\u0302i (b), and average intrinsic\nforce FSO in the transverse direction (c).

We find that hx\u0302i1 = hx\u0302i2 (up\nto numerical accuracy) and therefore plot only one of the\ntwo components.\nOur numerical results are presented in Figs. 6 and 7.\nThe difference between the two figures lies in the scattering amplitude g. In Fig. 7 the effective scattering amplitude g is already as large as 10 recoil energies ER\nand we can thereby conclude that the spin current is\nrather insensitive to the value of g. It is generally known\nthat strong non-linearity can qualitatively change system\nproperties. In BECs it leads to phenomena such as soliton and vortex creation. Normally the greatest impact\nof the non-linearity is seen around curve crossings [62].\nBeyond a critical value of the non-linearity (in our case\ng > gcrit ), in one dimension swallowtail loops are formed\nin the vicinity of the curve crossings characterizing additional stationary non-linear states, e.g. solitons. Up\nto this critical value the dynamics seems rather insensitive at least on a mean-field level. However, formation\nof these loops beyond the critical value implies break-\n\n\f9\ndown of the acceleration theorem [63]. To date, it seems\nthat analysis of these effects have been restricted to one\ndimensional situations and it is therefore not fully understood how non-linearity affects the structure of the\nDirac cones appearing in two dimensions. Nonetheless,\nwe have numerically found that the general structure of\nFigs. 6 and 7 drastically change for very large values of\ng. All present BO experiments, however, are performed\nin the weakly interacting regime where it is known that\nloops are absent, and we thereby restrict our analysis to\nthese experimentally more relevant parameter ranges.\nWe see from both Fig. 6 and 7 that the x and y motions are indeed correlated; when the Bloch oscillation\nreaches its turning points, the spin separation in the ydirection is roughly maximal and as the velocity in the\nlongitudinal x-direction changes sign, the spin separation\ndecreases due to the reversed sign of the intrinsic force.\nWhen the longitudinal velocity is the greatest (equivalent\nto maxima of the intrinsic force FSO ), the spin current is\nreversed. More precisely, as the atoms begin to accelerate in the tilted lattice the quasi-momentum kx increases\nlinearly in time and a spin current is built up in the transverse direction. However, after half a Bloch period the\nquasi-momentum reaches the Brillouin boundary and the\nx-motion is stopped and then reversed. Consequently,\nalso the spin current is reversed and one encounters a decreasing spin current in the y-direction. Finally, the spin\ncurrent has dropped to zero and builds up in the opposite direction instead. Hence, the spin current follows the\nsame oscillatory behavior as the BOs.\nOne may argue that a large spin separation should be\nhindered by the alternating sign of the velocity in the\nx-direction. Nonetheless, from our numerical results depicted in Figs. 6 and 7, we note that the spin separation in the y-direction is relatively large. Indeed, h\u0177i\nexceeds several site-spacings and furthermore this separation amplitude increases in time. The fact that neither\nthe oscillatory spin nor the oscillatory longitudinal current show a clean perfect harmonic pattern derives from,\nat the one hand possible non-adiabatic effects and the\nbreakdown of the acceleration theorem, and at the other\n(x)\nthat the transverse current induces an intrinsic force FSO\nin the longitudinal direction which adds to the extrinsic force Fex ex . The full coupled dynamics is therefore\nrather complex, but nonetheless, our figures make clear\nthe overall in-phase oscillations between the two currents.\nOn top of the oscillations of hx\u0302ii , there is a slight drift\ntoward negative values of x. This is an outcome of nonadiabaticity and breakdown of the acceleration theorem.\nHowever, this drift is rather small and the dynamics is\ntherefore predominantly adiabatic. This drift can be suppressed by increasing the lattice amplitude V on the cost\nthat the amplitude of longitudinal oscillations decreases.\nIt would not, however, imply a diminishing SHE since it\nis related to the longitudinal momentum and not position.\nA closer look at the two figures reveals that in the\ntransverse motions there is an additional oscillating mo-\n\ntion different from the spin current being in phase with\nthe BOs. This is believed to be Zitterbewegung clearly\nseen in the freely evolving wavepackets of Fig. 2. Contrary to that figure, here these oscillations do not collapse\nsuggesting that it might be preferable to detect the Zitterbewegung effect within a tilted lattice, compared to\nthe case of freely propagating atoms. The survival of\nZitterbewegung should as well derive from the alternating motion due to the optical lattice.\nFigures 6 and 7 have been calculated for an approximated initial ground state of the untilted lattice. As already pointed out, experimentally the condensate might\nbe prepared in the presence of an external trap, and then\nthe optical lattice as well as the coupling of the internal\nstates are turned on in such a way that the condensate\nis not in a true ground state of the coupled system. To\nanalyze the effect of such excitations, we have redone the\nsimulations of Figs. 6 and 7 for an initial Gaussian momentum state of a form depicted in Eq. (10) with p0 = 0\nand \u2206p = 0.1. The results are very similar to the ones\nof Figs. 6 and 7, and we therefore do not present them\nhere. We have also investigated the effect of a shallow\nharmonic potential in the transverse direction during the\nevolution in the tilted lattice. Again, a transverse spin\ncurrent is obtained, however this time the amplitude of\ntransverse oscillations is decreased due to the confining\npotential. This reduction of spin separation would indeed\nbe present in any experiment utilizing a confining trapping potential. The idea of employing an optical lattice\npotential as a trapping potential circumvent such shorting. In order to achieve trapping in this case one must\nstay within the BO regime, i.e. adiabatic. As Figs. 6\nand 7 demonstrates, even though the atoms oscillate a\nrelatively large spin current can build up during time.\nIn relation to the measurability of the spin separation,\nwe may note that even though |h\u0177i1 \u2212 h\u0177i2 | is considerably larger than the lattice spacing, it does not imply\nthat the two wave functions \u03c81 (x, y, t) and \u03c82 (x, y, t) do\nnot spatially overlap. In fact, the overlap is relatively\nlarge and fluorescent measurement of a single experimental run would therefore not contain sufficient information\nto reveal the spin current. However, this is hardly never\nthe case in true experimental realizations and instead an\nensemble of measurements should be considered, where\nthe ensemble average gives |h\u0177i1 \u2212 h\u0177i2 |. Since this value\nis presumably larger than the lattice spacing, it should\nindeed be measurable [64]. In the cold atom community,\ntime-of-flight measurements are often employed, in which\nit is the atomic momentum density that is being measured. If the separation of the momentum wave functions\nis non-zero, the position space wave functions \u03c81 (x, y, t)\nand \u03c82 (x, y, t) will set apart further during the time-offlight. If this separation is faster than the intrinsic wave\nfunction broadening, a finite time-of-flight measurement\nmay enhance the detection efficiency.\n\n\f10\n\n\u3008y\u3009\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\u221210\n0\n\n\u3008x\u3009\n\n(b)\n\u22125\n\u221210\n2\n\nFSO\n\n(c)\n0\n\u22122\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nt\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Same as in Fig. 6, but with an increased\natom-atom interaction; g = 10.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have considered an ultracold atomic\nsystem possessing three well-studied properties of condensed matter theory, Bloch oscillations, intrinsic spin\nHall currents, and Zitterbewegung.Our motivation for\nthis study comes from the fact that Bloch oscillations\nhave been verified in the same type of setups [25, 33],\nlight induced gauge potentials have been demonstrated\n[18, 19, 32], and Zitterbewegung have been detected in\nion-trap experiments [23].\nThe spin-Hall effect (SHE) and the Bloch oscillations\n(BO) in our system are driven by two perpendicular\nforces: the extrinsic force appearing due to tilting of\nthe lattice potential and the intrinsic force originating\nfrom the effective gauge potential caused by the spinorbit (SO) coupling. We demonstrated that the interplay\nbetween these two forces gives rise to a correlated motion in the xy-plane, and despite the fact that the BOs\nare expected to prevent a build up of large transverse\nspin currents, we argued that the SHE should indeed be\ndetectable. We utilized system parameters that should\nbe achievable in current experiments, e.g., the amplitude\nof the lattice potential is five recoil energies compared to\n\n[1] I. Zutic, J. Fabian, and S.

[25] ranging from\none to 14 recoil energies, and the SO coupling two recoil\nenergies compared to 8 recoil energies in Ref. [19]. For a\npotential amplitude as large as 14Er , the dispersions are\nalmost flat and longitudinal motion is almost frozen. The\nmomentum along the longitudinal direction do, however,\noscillate within the Brillouin size and, interestingly and\nsomewhat surprisingly, one would therefore see an oscillating transverse spin Hall current despite lack of longitudinal currents. We furthermore showed that the effects\nare insensitive to experimentally relevant atom-atom interaction strengths. Entering a strongly interacting gas\nseemed to affect our results and we argue that this is\nlikely to derive from a non-linearity induced breakdown\nof adiabaticity around the Dirac points. An additional\ninteresting aspect being discussed is the analogue of relativistic Zitterbewegung. Our numerical results indicate\nthat it may be preferable to consider an optical lattice\nconfiguration when studying this effect since it persists\nover longer time periods. The optical lattice convey as\nwell the possibility to avoid confining trapping potentials\npreventing large spin currents.\nWe should also point out that the system presented in\nthis paper allows for many extensions and different phenomena to be studied. For example, vortex generation\nin lattices [32, 65], Bose-Einstein condensation into nonzero momentum states [66], topologically ordered states\nof matter [67], or more strongly correlated systems, by\nmeans of second quantization of the mean-field Hamiltonian, may find realization in atoms possessing an internal\ntripod structure and trapped in optical lattices. The flexibility permits as well for various extensions, for example\ntime-dependent lattices or SO couplings. A recent paper considered Zitterbewegung of ultracold atoms for a\ndriven SO coupling [68]. The same idea can be utilized\nin order to increase the transverse spin current in our\nmodel.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJL acknowledges support from the MEC program\n(FIS2005-04627).
