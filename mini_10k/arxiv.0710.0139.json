Recent observations of the Galactic center revealed a nuclear disk of young OB stars,\nin addition to many similar outlying stars with higher eccentricities and/or high inclinations\nrelative to the disk (some of them possibly belonging to a second disk). Binaries in such nuclear\ndisks, if they exist in non-negligible fractions, could have a major role in the evolution of the disks\nthrough binary heating of this stellar system. We suggest that interactions with/in binaries may\nexplain some (or all) of the observed outlying young stars in the Galactic center. Such stars could\nhave been formed in a disk, and later on kicked out from it through binary related interactions,\nsimilar to ejection of high velocity runaway OB stars in young clusters throughout the galaxy.\nKeywords. Galaxy: center - black hole physics - stars: kinematics - binaries: general\n\nRecent observations have revealed the existence of many young OB stars in the galactic\ncenter (GC). Accurate measurements of the orbital paramters of these stars give strong\nevidence for the existence of a massive black hole (MBH) which govern the dynamics in\nthe GC (Eisenhauer et al. 2005). Most of the young stars are observed to be OB stars\nin the central 0.5 pc around the MBH. Many of them are observed in a coherent stellar\ndisk or two perpendicular disks configurations (Lu et al. 2006; Paumard et al. 2006).\nOthers are observed to be have inclined and/or eccentric (> 0.5) orbits relative to the\nstellar disks (hereafter outliers). The inner 0.04 pc near the MBH contain only young\nB-stars, that possibly have a different origin (e.g. Levin 2007; Perets et al. 2007).\nIt was suggested that the disk stars have been formed a few Myrs years ago in a\nfragmenting gaseous disk (Nayakshin & Cuadra 2005; Levin 2007). However, the origin\nof outliers from the disk is difficult to explain in this way. These stars are observed to\nhave very similar stellar properties to the young disk stars (types, lifetimes), but have\nmore inclined and/or eccentric orbits. Many suggestions have been made for the origin\nof these stars (Milosavljevi\u0107 $ Loeb 2004; Paumard et al. 2006; Alexander et al. 2007;\nYu et al 2007, and references therein). Here we suggest a different process in which young\nstars in the GC stellar disks were kicked into high inclinations and/or eccentricities, in\na similar way to OB runaway stars ejected from open clusters. Such a scenario could\nexplain some of the puzzling orbital properties of the young stars in the GC.\nA considerable fraction of the early OB stars in the solar neighborhood have large\npeculiar velocities (40 6 vpec 6 200 km s\u22121 ; e.g. Hoogerwerf et al. 2001) and are observed in isolated locations; these are the so-called runaway stars (Blaauw 1961). Two\nmechanisms are thought to eject OB runaway stars, both involve binarity (or higher\nmultiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario (BSS; Blaauw 1961) a star is kicked at\nhigh velocity following a supernova explosion of its companion. In the dynamical ejection\nscenario (DES; Poveda et al. 1967) runaway stars are ejected through gravitational interactions between stars in dense, compact clusters. The DES is more likely for the disk\nstars, given the short lifetime of the disk.\nThe binary properties of stars in the GC are unknown, but observations of eclipsing\nbinaries in the GC suggests they are not fundamentally different from that observed in\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPerets, Kupi & Alexander\n5\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n4\n\n0.08\n3\n0.06\n2\n0.04\n1\n0\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nEccentricity\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nInclination (deg.)\n\nFigure 1.

It is thus quite likely that dynamical ejection in the disk\nis more frequent and efficient than in normal Galactic star forming regions. In order to\nescape the GC cusp, a disk star initially bounded to the MBH needs a kick velocity of\na few\u00d7102 km s\u22121 . Most of the observed OB runaways in the galaxy do not reach such\nhigh velocities. Therefore runaways from the stellar disk would not escape, and would\nremain in the cusp. However, such kicks could considerably change the orbits of these\nstars. In fig. 1 we show the inclination and eccentricity distribution of OB stars that were\nformed in a disk on circular orbits and were kicked out of the disk with velocities typical\nof OB runaways (40 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 ). Stars in the disk with near circular Keplerian orbits,\nwould be kicked into more eccentric and inclined orbits (on average). Their orbits should\nalso display some correlations between inclination, eccentricity and mass. Such \"failed\"\nrunaways could possibly explain the outliers from and inside the disks in the GC, which\nare difficult to explain otherwise.\nReferences\nAlexander, R. D., Begelman, M.
