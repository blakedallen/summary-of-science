Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove a reduced equivalence theorem for crosssectional algebras of Fell bundles over groupoids, and to prove that the imprimitivity\nbimodule which implements the equivalence between the reduced C \u2217 -algebras is a\nquotient of the Muhly-Williams equivalence bimodule between the full C \u2217 -algebras\n[16].\nAn increasingly influential interpretation of Hilbert bimodules (or C \u2217 -correspondences) is to regard them as generalized endomorphisms of C \u2217 -algebras. Imprimitivity bimodules represent isomorphisms, and a Fell bundle over a groupoid G is\nthen the counterpart of an action of G on a C0 (G0 )-algebra A. The cross-sectional\nalgebras of the bundle are analogues of groupoid crossed products. For example,\nDate: 1 December 2011.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L55.\nKey words and phrases.

WILLIAMS\n\nif G is a group and each imprimitivity module is of the form \u03b1 A for an automorphism \u03b1 of A (see, for example [18]), then the cross-sectional algebras of such\nbundles are precisely those arising from group crossed products; Fell and Doran\ncalled these semidirect products in their magnum opus [5, \u00a7VIII.4.2]. In particular, if A = C0 (G(0) ) and each fibre of the Fell-bundle is 1-dimensional, then the\ncross-sectional algebras are the usual groupoid C \u2217 -algebras.\nThe classical result which motivates this paper is that if groups G and H act\nfreely, properly and transitively on the same locally compact Hausdorff space P\nand the actions commute, then the groups are the same. To see why, fix x \u2208 P .\nThen for each g \u2208 G, there is a unique h \u2208 H such that g * x = x * h, and since the\nactions commute, g 7\u2192 h is an isomorphism of G with H. Hence C \u2217 (G) \u223c\n= C \u2217 (H)\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u223c\nand Cr (G) = Cr (H). A particularly powerful viewpoint on this is the following. If\nP op is a copy of the space P , but with the actions reversed so that G acts on the\nright and H on the left, then L = G \u2294 P \u2294 P op \u2294 H is a groupoid, called the linking\ngroupoid, with two units. The isotropy at one unit is G and the isotropy at the other\nis H, and conjugation in L by any element of P determines an isomorphism from\nG to H. At the level of C \u2217 -algebras, we obtain the following very nice picture: the\nactions of G and H on P induce convolution-like products Cc (G) \u00d7 Cc (P ) \u2192 Cc (P )\nand Cc (P )\u00d7Cc (H) \u2192 Cc (P ), and Cc (L) decomposes as a block 2\u00d72 matrix algebra\n\u0012\n\u0013\nCc (G)\nCc (P )\n.\nCc (L) \u223c\n=\nCc (P op ) Cc (H)\nMoreover, the universal norm on Cc (L) restricts to the universal norm on each of\nCc (G) and Cc (H), and likewise for reduced norms. The characteristic function 1P\nof P is a partial isometry in the multiplier algebra of each of C \u2217 (L) and Cr\u2217 (L) and\nconjugation by 1P implements the isomorphisms C \u2217 (G) \u223c\n=\n= C \u2217 (H) and Cr\u2217 (G) \u223c\n\u2217\nCr (H).\nWhen G and H do not act transitively, the actions of G and H on P induce\nactions of G on P/H and of H on G\\P . The picture at the level of groups is\nnow somewhat more complicated, but the C \u2217 -algebraic picture carries over nicely:\nreplacing Cc (G) with Cc (G, Cc (P/H)) and Cc (H) with Cc (H, Cc (G\\P )) in the\nmatrix above, we obtain a \u2217 -algebra L(P ). The C \u2217 -identity allows us to extend\nthe norm on C0 (P/H) \u22ca G to a norm on L(P ). Moreover, this norm is consistent\nwith the norm on C0 (G\\P ) \u22ca H, and the completion of L(P ) in this norm contains\nC0 (P/H)\u22ca G and C0 (G\\P )\u22ca H as complementary full corners. Further, this whole\napparatus descends under quotient maps to reduced crossed products.\nTo prove an analogue of this equivalence theorem in the context of Fell bundles,\none uses the notion of an equivalence of Fell bundles specified in [16]. The concept\nis closely modeled on the situation of groups; but the natural objects on which Fell\nbundles act are Banach bundles in which the fibres are equivalence bimodules. That\nis, given Fell bundles B and C over groupoids G and H, an equivalence between\nthe two is, roughly speaking, an upper semicontinuous Banach bundle E over a\nspace Z such that Z admits actions of G and H making it into an equivalence of\ngroupoids in the sense of Renault, each fibre Ez of E is an imprimitivity bimodule\nfrom the fibre Br(z) of B over r(z) to Cs(z) , and there are fibred multiplication\noperations B \u2217 E \u2192 E and E \u2217 C \u2192 E which are compatible with the bundle maps,\nand which implement isomorphisms Bx \u2297Bu Ez \u223c\n= Ex*z . Muhly and Williams show\nin [16, Theorem 6.4] that given such an equivalence, the full cross-sectional algebras\n\n\fFELL NOTES\n\n3\n\nC \u2217 (G, B) and C \u2217 (H, C ) are Morita equivalent (Kumjian proves the corresponding\nstatement for reduced C \u2217 -algebras in the r-discrete situation in [13]).\nIn this paper, we show that Muhly and Williams's Morita equivalence passes to\nreduced algebras. We do so by constructing a linking bundle L(E ) = B\u2294E \u2294E op \u2294C\nand showing that \u0393c (L; L(E )) has a matrix decomposition as above. We then prove\nthat the completion of L(E ) in the universal norm is a linking algebra for a Morita\nequivalence between C \u2217 (G, B) and C \u2217 (H, C ), and likewise for reduced C \u2217 -algebras.\nWe conclude by showing how to recover a generalisation of Quigg and Spielberg's\ntheorem [19] which says that the symmetric imprimitivity bimodule arising in Raeburn's symmetric imprimitivity theorem [20] passes under the quotient map to an\nimprimitivity bimodule for reduced crossed products.\nOur reduced equivalence theorem itself is not new: late in the development of this\npaper, we learned that Moutou and Tu also prove that equivalent Fell bundles have\nMorita equivalent reduced cross-sectional algebras [14]. It appears that Moutou and\nTu deal only with Fell bundles whose underlying Banach bundles are required to be\ncontinuous rather than just upper semicontinuous. (Upper semicontinuous bundles\nturn out to be the more natural object in the context of C \u2217 -algebras - see [16]\nand especially [23, Appendix C]). Moreover Moutou and Tu restrict attention to\nprinciple G-spaces for their groupoid equivalences. But these are minor points and\nthe arguments of [14] would surely go through unchanged to our setting. The main\nnew contribution in this article that we develop the linking bundle technology to\nshow explicitly that the full cross-sectional algebras of the linking bundle is a linking\nalgebra for the full cross sectional algebras of B and C , and that the quotient map\nfrom the full to the reduced cross-sectional algebra of the linking bundle implements\nthe quotients C \u2217 (G, B) \u2192 Cr\u2217 (G, B) and C \u2217 (H, C ) \u2192 Cr\u2217 (H, C ). In particular, if\nIrC is the ideal of C \u2217 (H, C ) consisting of elements whose reduced norm is zero,\nthen the equivalence bimodule Xr which we obtain between reduced cross-sectional\nalgebras is the quotient of the equivalence bimodule X between full algebras by\nX * IrC . Consequently, induction over X carries IrC to the corresponding ideal IrB\nof C \u2217 (G, B).\n2. Background\nRecall that for second-countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids G and H,\na G \u2013 H equivalence is a locally compact Hausdorff space Z which is simultaneously\na free and proper left G-space and a free and proper right H-space (with continuous\nopen fibre maps) such that the actions of G and H on Z commute, the map rZ\ninduces a homeomorphism of Z/H with G(0) and the map sZ induces a homeomorphism of G\\Z with H (0) . Then G acts on Z \u2217r Z by g * (y, z) = (g * y, g * z), and\nthe formula h * [g, h]H = g defines a homeomorphism [*, *]H : G\\(Z \u2217r Z) \u2192 H; and\nG [*, *] : Z \u2217s Z \u2192 G is defined similarly (see [15, Definition 2.1] for details).\nRecall that an upper semicontinuous Banach bundle over a locally compact Hausdorff space Z is a topological space B together with a continuous open surjection\nq : B \u2192 Z such that each Bz := q \u22121 (z) is a Banach space and: b 7\u2192 kbk is upper\nsemicontinuous; addition is continuous from B \u2217q B \u2192 B; scalar multiplication is\ncontinuous on B; and kbi k \u2192 0 and q(bi ) \u2192 z implies bi \u2192 0z \u2208 q \u22121 (z). The concept of an upper semicontinuous Banach bundle goes back to [3], where they were\ncalled (H)-bundles, and the work of Hofmann [2, 6\u20138]. Fell calls such bundles loose\nin [4, Remark C.1]. Further details and comments concerning upper semicontinuous\n\n\f4\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P. WILLIAMS\n\nBanach bundles are given in [16, Appendix A] and in the C \u2217 -case in [23, Appendix C]. As in [16], a Fell bundle over a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid G is an\nupper semicontinuous Banach bundle q : B \u2192 G endowed with a continuous bilinear associative map (a, b) 7\u2192 ab from B (2) := { (a, b) \u2208 B \u00d7 B : s(q(a)) = r(q(b)) }\nto B such that\nq(ab) = q(a)q(b) for all (a, b) \u2208 B (2) ;\nq(a\u2217 ) = q(a)\u22121 for all a \u2208 B;\n(ab)\u2217 = b\u2217 a\u2217 for all (a, b) \u2208 B (2) ;\nfor each u \u2208 G(0) , the fibre Au := q \u22121 (u) is a C \u2217 -algebra under these\noperations; and\n(e) for each g \u2208 G \\ G(0) , the fibre Bg := q \u22121 (g) is an Ar(g) \u2013 As(g) -imprimitivity bimodule with actions determined by multiplication in B and inner\nproducts ha , bi = a\u2217 b and ha , bi = ab\u2217 .\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nAs a notational convenience, we define r, s : B \u2192 G(0) by r(a) := rG (q(a)) and\ns(a) := sG (q(a)). See [16] for more details regarding Fell bundles over groupoids.\nRemark 1. In the context of bundles over groups, the fibres in a Fell bundle are not\nalways assumed to be imprimitivity bimodules (they are not assumed to be full -\nsee [13, 2.4]). Bundles in which all the fibres are indeed imprimitivity bimodules\nare then called saturated. We take this condition as part of our definition. It should\nalso be observed that the underlying Banach bundle of a Fell bundle over a group\nis always continuous [1, Lemma 3.30].\nRemark 2. In our notation the fibre of B over a unit u can be denoted either Au\nor Bu . The dual notation allows us to emphasise its dual roles. We write Au to\nemphasise its role as a C \u2217 -algebra, and Bu to emphasise its role as an imprimitivity bimodule. The C \u2217 -algebra A := \u03930 (G(0) ; B) is called the C \u2217 -algebra of the Fell\nbundle B over G(0) .\nWe recall from [16] the definition of an equivalence of Fell bundles. First, fix a\nsecond-countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoid G, a left G-space Z, a Fell\nbundle qG : B \u2192 G, and a Hausdorff space E together with a continuous open\nsurjection q : E \u2192 Z. Again, as a notational convenience, we shall write r for the\ncomposition rZ \u25e6 q : E \u2192 G(0) . we say that B acts on the left of E if there is a\npairing (b, e) 7\u2192 b * e from B \u2217 E = { (b, e) \u2208 B \u00d7 E : s(b) = r(e) } to E such that\n(a) q(b * e) = qG (b)q(e) for (b, e) \u2208 B \u2217 E ;\n(b) a * (b * e) = (ab) * e whenever (a, b) \u2208 B (2) and (b, e) \u2208 B \u2217 E ;\n(c) kb * ek \u2264 kbkkek for (b, e) \u2208 B \u2217 E .1\nIf E is a right H-space, and qH : C \u2192 H is a Fell bundle, then a right action of C\non E is defined similarly.\nNow fix second-countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids G and H and a\nG \u2013 H equivalence Z.

Our goal in this article is to establish the corresponding\nstatement for Fell bundles. As a first step, we show in the next section how to\nconstruct from an equivalence of Fell bundles a linking bundle over the linking\ngroupoid.\n3. Linking bundles\n\nLet G and H be locally compact Hausdorff groupoids, let Z be a G \u2013 H equivalence, and let L be the linking groupoid as above. Suppose that pG : B \u2192 G and\npH : C \u2192 H are upper-semicontinuous Fell bundles, and that q : E \u2192 Z is a bundle\n(0)\nequivalence. We denote by A the C \u2217 -algebra \u03930 (G(0) ; p\u22121\n)) of the bundle B,\nG (G\n(0)\n\u2217\n(0) \u22121\nand by D the C -algebra \u03930 (H ; pH (H )) of C ; so the fibre over u \u2208 G(0) is\nAu , the fibre over v \u2208 H (0) is Dv , and each Ez is an Ar(z) \u2013 Ds(z) -imprimitivity\nbimodule.\nLet E op = { \u0113 : e \u2208 E } be a copy of the topological space E endowed with\nthe conjugate Banach space structure \u03b1\u0113 + f \u0304 = (\u03b1e + f ) on each fibre. Then\nq op : E op \u2192 Z op is an upper-semicontinuous Banach bundle with q op (\u0113) = q(e).\nWe have s(\u0113) = s(q op (\u0113)) = r(e) and likewise r(\u0113) = s(e), so we obtain a right\nB-action and a left C -action on E op by\n(1)\n\n\u0113 * b = b\u2217 * e\n\nand\n\nc * \u0113 = e * c\u2217 .\n\n\f6\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P.

Routine calculations show that each E op (z\u0304) is the dual\nC\nC\nimprimitivity bimodule E(z)\u223c of E(z). Since s(z) = r(z\u0304) and r(z) = s(z\u0304), axioms\n(a), (b) and (c) of [16, Definition 6.1] hold, so E op is a C \u2013 B-equivalence.\nLet L(E ) = B \u2294 E \u2294 E op \u2294 C and define L(q) : L(E ) \u2192 L by\nL(q)|B = pG ,\n\nL(q)|C = pH ,\n\nL(q)|E = q\n\nand\n\nL(q)|E op = q op .\n\nSince e 7\u2192 \u0113 is a fiberwise-isometric homeomorphism from E to E op and since z 7\u2192 z\u0304\nis a homeomorphism from Z to Z op , the bundle L(E ) is an upper semicontinuous\nBanach bundle. Let\nL(E )(2) = { (a, b) \u2208 L(E ) \u00d7 L(E ) : s(L(q)(a)) = r(L(q)(b)) }.\nDefine m : L(E )(2) \u2192 L(E ) to coincide with the given multiplications on B and C\nand with the actions of B and C on E and E op , and to satisfy\nm(e, f \u0304) = he , f i for (e, f ) \u2208 E \u2217s E and m(\u0113, f ) = he , f i for (e, f ) \u2208 E \u2217r E .\nB\n\nC\n\nWe define a 7\u2192 a\u2217 on L(E ) to extend the given involutions on B and C by setting\ne\u2217 = \u0113 on E and \u0113\u2217 = e on E op .\nLemma 3. With notation as above, the bundle L(E ) is a Fell bundle over L.\nMoreover, the C \u2217 -algebra \u03930 (L(0) ; L(q)\u22121 (L(0) )) is isomorphic to A \u2295 D.\nProof. We know already that L(E ) is an upper-semicontinuous Banach bundle, that\neach L(E )u is a C \u2217 -algebra and each L(E )x is a L(E )r(x) \u2013 L(E )s(x) -imprimitivity\nbimodule. The fibre map q preserves multiplication and involution by definition of\nthese operations. The operations are continuous because they are continuous on\neach component of L(E ) and of L(E ) \u2217 L(E ), and the components are topologically\ndisjoint. That (ab)\u2217 = b\u2217 a\u2217 is clear on B \u2217 B and C \u2217 C , follows from the innerproduct axioms on E \u2217 E op an E op \u2217 E , and follows from (1) for the remaining\npairings. Associativity for triples from E \u2217 E op \u2217 E and E op \u2217 E \u2217 E op follows from\nthe imprimitivity bimodule axiom he , f ig = ehf , gi , and is clear for all other\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\ntriples.\nThe map f 7\u2192 (f |G(0) , f |H (0) ) is a surjection \u03930 (L(0) ; L(q)\u22121 (L(0) )) \u2192 A \u2295 D,\nand the inverse makes sense because G(0) and H (0) are topologically disjoint. Hence\n\u03930 (L(0) ; L(q)\u22121 (L(0) )) \u223c\n\u0003\n=A\u2295D\nResume the hypotheses of Lemma 3. It is routine to check that (pG \u03c6)(g) :=\n\u03c7G(0) (r(g))\u03c6(g) determines a bounded self-adjoint map on \u0393c (G; B) under the\ninner-product (\u03c6, \u03c8) 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c8, and hence extends to a multiplier projection, also\ndenoted pG , of C \u2217 (G; B). Taking adjoints, (\u03c6pG )(a) = \u03c7G(0) (s(a))\u03c6(a). The corresponding projection pH for H is defined similarly.\nRemark 4. As in [22], we think of \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393c (L, L(E )) as a matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6G \u03c6Z\n\u03c6Z op \u03c6H\nwhere \u03c6G is the restriction of \u03c6 to G \u2286 L and similarly for the other terms. With\nrespect to this decomposition, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6G \u03c8Z + \u03c6Z \u03c8H\n\u03c6G \u03c8G + \u03c6Z \u03c8Z op\n,\n\u03c6\u03c8 =\n\u03c6Z op \u03c8G + \u03c6H \u03c8Z \u03c6Z op \u03c8Z + \u03c6H \u03c8H\n\n\fFELL NOTES\n\n7\n\nwhere we have used juxtaposition for the convolution product restricted to the\nvarious corners.2 Moreover \u03c6G = pG \u03c6pG , \u03c6Z = pG \u03c6pH , \u03c6Z op = pH \u03c6pG , and\n\u03c6H = pH \u03c6pH .\nLemma 5. Resume the hypotheses of Lemma 3. Then pG and pH are full multiplier\nprojections of C \u2217 (L; L(E )).\nProof. We just show that pG is full; the corresponding statement for pH follows by\nsymmetry. Fix \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393c (L; L(E )). Using the matrix notation established above,\nwe have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6G \u03c8G\n\u03c6G \u03c8Z\n.\n\u03c6pG \u03c8 =\n\u03c6Z op \u03c8G \u03c6Z op \u03c8Z\nThat elements of the form \u03c6G \u03c8G span a dense subalgebra of \u0393c (G; B) is clear. That\nelements of the form \u03c6G \u03c8Z span a dense subspace of \u0393c (Z; E ) and likewise that\nelements of the form \u03c6Z op \u03c8G span a dense subspace of \u0393c (Z op ; E op ) follows from\n[16, Proposition 6.10]. That elements of the form \u03c6Z op \u03c8Z span a dense subspace of\n\u0393c (H; C ) follows from the argument which establishes axiom (IB2) in [16, Section 7].\n\u0003\nRecall that the inductive-limit topology on Cc (X) for a locally compact Hausdorff space X is the unique finest locally convex topology such that for each compact\nK \u2286 X, the inclusion of Cc (X)K = {f \u2208 Cc (X) : supp(f ) \u2286 K} into Cc (X) is continuous (see for example [4, II.14.3] or [21, \u00a7D.2]). In particular, [21, Lemma D.10]\nsays that to check that a linear map L from Cc (X) into any locally convex space\nM is continuous, it suffices to see that if fn \u2192 f uniformly and if all the supports\nof the fn are contained in the same compact set K, then L(fn ) \u2192 L(f ).\nRemark 6. We are now in a situation analogous to that of [22, Remark 8]. By\nthe Disintegration Theorem for Fell bundles, [16, Theorem 4.13], any pre-C \u2217 -norm\nk * k\u03b1 on \u0393c (L; L(E )) which is continuous in the inductive-limit topology is dominated by the universal norm. Hence the argument of [22, Remark 8] shows that\npG C\u03b1\u2217 (L; L(E ))pH is a C\u03b1\u2217 (G; B) \u2013 C\u03b1\u2217 (H; C )-imprimitivity bimodule. So to prove\nthat C \u2217 (G; B) is Morita equivalent to C \u2217 (H, C ) we just need to show that for\nF \u2208 pG \u0393c (L; L(E ))pG , the universal norms kF kC \u2217(L,L(E )) and F |G C \u2217 (G;B) coincide, and similarly for the reduced algebras (the corresponding statements for H\nhold by symmetry).\n4. The reduced norm\nIn this section we recall the construction of the reduced cross-sectional algebra\nof a Fell bundle. We first discuss how to induce representations from C \u2217 -algebra\nof the restriction of a Fell bundle to a closed subgroupoid up to representations\nof the C \u2217 -algebra of the whole bundle. We then apply this construction to the\nclosed subgroupoid G(0) of G to induce representations of the C \u2217 -algebra A =\n\u03930 (G(0) ; B|G(0) ) up to representations of C \u2217 (G; B). These are, by definition, the\nregular representations whose supremum determines the reduced norm.\n2In fact, the products in the matrix can be expressed in terms of the inner-products and module\nactions from [16, Theorem 6.4].\n\n\f8\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P.

We write qH : B|H \u2192 H for the Fell bundle obtained\nby restriction to H. We want to induce representations of C \u2217 (H, B|H ) to C \u2217 (G; B)\nusing the Equivalence Theorem [16, Theorem 6.4] for Fell bundles. We will use the\nset-up and notation from [10, \u00a72]. In particular, we recall that GH (0) = s\u22121 (H (0) ) is\na (H G , H)-equivalence where H G is the imprimitivity groupoid\n(GH (0) \u2217s GH (0) )/H.\n\u0001\nLet \u03c3 : H G \u2192 G be the continuous map given by \u03c3 [x, y] = xy \u22121 . The pull-back\nFell bundle \u03c3 \u2217 q : \u03c3 \u2217 B \u2192 H G is the Fell bundle \u03c3 \u2217 B = {([x, y], b) : [x, y] \u2208 H G , b \u2208\nB, \u03c3([x, y]) = q(b)} with bundle map \u03c3 \u2217 ([x, y], b) = [x, y] over H G .\nLet E = q \u22121 (GH (0) ); then q restricts to a map q : E \u2192 GH (0) . We wish to make\nthis Banach bundle into a \u03c3 \u2217 B \u2013 B|H -equivalence (see [16, Definition 6.1]). It is\nclear how B|H acts on the right of E , and we get a left action of \u03c3 \u2217 B via\n\u0001\n[x, y], b * e := be for q(e) = yh.\n\n(Since q(b) = xy \u22121 , q(be) = xh as required.)

It now straightforward to check that E is a \u03c3 \u2217 B \u2013 B|H -equivalence.\nBy [16, Theorem 6.4], \u0393c (GH (0) ; E ) is a pre-imprimitivity bimodule with actions\nand inner products determined by\nZ\n\u0001\n(2)\nF * \u03c6(z) =\nF [z, y] \u03c6(y) d\u03bbs(z) (y),\nZG\n(3)\n\u03c6 * g(z) =\n\u03c6(zh)g(h\u22121 ) d\u03b1s(z) (h),\nH\nZ\n(4)\n\u03c6(y)\u2217 \u03c8(yh) d\u03bbr(h) (y),\nh\u03c6 , \u03c8i (h) =\n\u22c6\nG\nZ\n\u0001\n(5)\n\u03c6(xh)\u03c8(yh)\u2217 d\u03b1s(x) (h)\nh\u03c6 , \u03c8i [x, y] =\n\u22c6\n\nG\n\nG\n\n\u2217\n\nfor F \u2208 \u0393c (H ; \u03c3 B), \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393c (GH (0) ; E ) and g \u2208 \u0393c (H; B|H ).

It is pleasing to note that the formalism of Fell bundles is such that\nequations (2)\u2013(5) are virtually identical to those in the scalar case: see [10, Eq.\n(1)\u2013(4)].3 The only difference is that complex conjugates in the scalar case are\nreplaced by adjoints.\nTo construct induced representations using the machinery of [21, Proposition 2.66], we need a nondegenerate homomorphism V : C \u2217 (G; B) \u2192 L(X) which\nwill make X into a right Hilbert C \u2217 (G; B) \u2013 C \u2217 (H, B|H )-bimodule (the data needed\nto induce representations a la Rieffel.)

Then [11, Proposition 1.7] implies that V\nis bounded and extends to a nondegenerate homomorphism as required.\nNow if L is a representation of C \u2217 (H, B|H ), then the induced representation\n\u2217\nIndG\nH L of C (G; B) acts on the completion of X \u2299 HL with respect to\n\u0001\n(\u03c6 \u2297 h | \u03c8 \u2297 k) = L(h\u03c8 , \u03c6i )h | k HL .\n\u22c6\n\nFix \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393c (GH (0) ; E ).

Regular Representations and the reduced C \u2217 -algebra. Regular representations are, by definition, those induced from A = \u03930 (G(0) ; B). Thus, in the\nnotation of Section 4.1, H = G(0) , GH (0) = G, E = B, and we write A in place of\nB|G(0) (see Remark 2); in particular each B(x) is a A(r(x)) \u2013 A(s(x))-imprimitivity\nbimodule. We also have h\u03c6 , \u03c8i = \u03c6\u2217 \u03c8|G(0) , with the product being computed in\n\u22c6\n\u0393c (L; L(E )).\nLet \u03c0 be a representation of A on H\u03c0 . Let \u03c0\u0303 be the extension\n\u0001 of \u03c0 to M (A), and\nlet i : C0 (G(0) ) \u2192 M (A) be the map characterised by i(f )a (u) = f (u)a(u) for\nu \u2208 G(0) . Then \u03c6 := \u03c0\u0303 \u25e6 i is a representation of C0 (G(0) ) on H\u03c0 which commutes\nwith \u03c0. Example F.25 of [23] shows that there is a Borel Hilbert bundle G(0) \u2217 H\na finite Radon measure \u03bc on G(0) such that \u03c0 is equivalent to a direct integral\nRand\n\u2295\n(0)\n)\nG(0) \u03c0u d\u03bc, and such that if L : f \u2192 Lf is the diagonal inclusion of C0 (G\n2\n(0)\nin B(L (G \u2217 H , \u03bc)), then \u03c0(i(f )a) = Lf \u03c0(a)\nfor a \u2208 A. So each \u03c0u factors\n\u0001\nthrough Au . We will usually write \u03c0u a(u) in place of \u03c0u (a) for a \u2208 A. See\n[17, p. 46] for more details. The regular representation Ind \u03c0 = IndG\nG(0) \u03c0 then acts\n\u0001\n2\n(0)\non the completion\nof\n\u0393\n(G;\nB)\n\u2299\nL\n(G\n\u2217\nH\n,\n\u03bc)\nwith\nrespect\nto\n\u03c6\n\u2297\nh\n|\n\u03c8\n\u2297\nk\n=\nc\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u03c0 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c6 h | k , and a quick calculation yields\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(7)\n\u03c6\u2297h|\u03c8\u2297k =\n\u03c0u \u03c8(x)\u2217 \u03c6(x) h(u) | k(u) d\u03bbu (x) d\u03bc(u).\nG(0)\n\nG\n\nThen Ind \u03c0 acts by:\n(8)\n\n(Ind \u03c0)(f )(\u03c6 \u2297 h) = V (f )(\u03c6) \u2297 h = f * \u03c6 \u2297 h.\n\nWe next define the reduced algebra of a Fell bundle. We define the reduced norm\nby analogy with the one-dimensional case as the supremum of the norms determined\nby induced representations of A. We then show that this agrees, via V , with the\noperator norm on L(X). This is equivalent to Definition 2.4 and Lemma 2.7 of [14],\nthough the roles of definition and lemma are interchanged.\n\n\f10\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P. WILLIAMS\n\nDefinition 8. We define the reduced norm on \u0393c (G; B) by\nkf kr := sup{ k(Ind \u03c0)(f )k : \u03c0 is a representation of A }.\nSince the kernel of Ind \u03c0 depends only on the kernel of \u03c0 (see [21, Corollary 2.73]),\nwe have kf kr = k(Ind \u03c0)(f )k for any faithful representation \u03c0 of A. We define the\nreduced C \u2217 -algebra Cr\u2217 (G; B) of B to be the quotient of C \u2217 (G; B) by ICr\u2217 (G,B) :=\n{ a \u2208 C \u2217 (G, B) : kakr = 0 }.\nLemma 9. Let X = XG\nand V : C \u2217 (G; B) \u2192 L(X) the homomorphism deG(0)\ntermined by (6). Then ker V = ICr\u2217 (G;B) and V factors through an injection of\nCr\u2217 (G; B) into L(X). In particular, kV (f )k = kf kr .\nProof. Let \u03c0 be a faithful representation of A. Then for any x \u2208 X, h \u2208 H\u03c0 and\nf \u2208 C \u2217 (G; B), we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n2\n(9)\n(Ind \u03c0)(f )(x \u2297 h) = V (f )(x) \u2297 h = \u03c0 hV (f )(x) , V (f )(x)i h | h .\n\u22c6\n\nThus if V (f ) = 0, then (Ind \u03c0)(f ) = 0. On the other hand, given x and f , we can\nfind a unit vector h such that the right-hand side of (9) is at least\n\u0001\n1\n1\n2\n=\n\u03c0 hV (f )(x) , V (f )(x)i\nV (f )(x) .\n\u22c6\n2\n2\nTherefore Ind \u03c0(f ) = 0 implies that V (f ) = 0. We have shown that ker V =\nker(Ind \u03c0), and hence V factors through an injection of Cr\u2217 (G; B) into L(X) as\nclaimed.\n\u0003\n\nWe digress briefly to check that the definition of the reduced C \u2217 -algebra which\nwe have given is compatible with existing definitions on some special cases.\nExample 10 (The Scalar Case: Groupoid C \u2217 -Algebras). Let B = G \u00d7 C so\nthat C \u2217 (G; B) = C \u2217 (G). So A = C0 (G(0) ), and \u03c0 defined by multiplication on\nL2 (G(0) , \u03bc) is a faithful representation of A. Then Ind \u03c0 acts on the completion H\nof Cc (G) \u2299 L2 (G(0) ) and, if we let \u03bd = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03bb, then (7) becomes\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c6(x)h(s(x)) | \u03c8(x)k(s(x)) d\u03bd \u22121 (x).\n\u03c6\u2297h |\u03c8\u2297k =\nG\n\nHence there is a unitary U from H onto L2 (G, \u03bd \u22121 ) defined by U (\u03c6 \u2297 h)(x) =\nand U intertwines Ind \u03c0 with the representation (Ind \u03bc)(f )\u03be(x) =\nR\u03c6(x)h(s(x)),\n\u22121\nf\n(y)\u03be(y\nx)\nd\u03bbr(x) (y). Hence our definition of the reduced norm agrees with\nG\nthe usual definition (see [22, \u00a73], for example), and Cr\u2217 (G \u00d7 C) = Cr\u2217 (G).\n\nExample 11 (Groupoid Crossed Products). Suppose that (A , G, \u03b1) is a dynamical\nsystem and form the associated semidirect product Fell bundle B = r\u2217 A as in\n[16, Example 2.1]. Working with the appropriate A -valued functions, as in [16,\nExample 2.8], a quick calculation starting from (7) gives\n\u0001\n(10) f \u2297 h | g \u2297 k =\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\ng(x) k(u) d\u03bbu (x) d\u03bc(u).\nf (x) h(u) | \u03c0u \u03b1\u22121\n\u03c0u \u03b1\u22121\nx\nx\nG(0)\n\nG\n\n(Since \u03bbu is supported on Gu , each \u03b1\u22121\nx (g(x)) \u2208 Au , so the integrand makes sense.)\nLet G \u2217 Hs be the pull back of G(0) \u2217 H via s. Given a representation \u03c0 of A, there\nis a unitary U from the space of Ind \u03c0 to L2 (G \u2217 Hs , \u03bd \u22121 ) defined by U (f \u2297 h) =\n\n\fFELL NOTES\n\n11\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\nf (x) h s(x) . This U intertwines Ind \u03c0 with the representation L\u03c0\n\u03c0s(x) \u03b1\u22121\nx\ngiven by\nZ\n\u0001\u0001\n\u03c0\nf (y) \u03be(y \u22121 x) d\u03bbr(x) (y).\n(11)\nL (f )\u03be(x) =\n\u03c0s(x) \u03b1\u22121\nx\nG\n\nApplying this with a faithful representation \u03c0 of A, we deduce that A \u22ca\u03b1,r G \u223c\n=\nCr\u2217 (G, r\u2217 A ).\nRemark 12. In Examples 10 and 11, the essential step in finding a concrete realization of the space of Ind \u03c0 is to \"distribute the \u03c0u \" in the integrand in (7) to\nboth sides of the inner product. But for general Fell bundles, \u03c0u (\u03c6(x)) makes no\nsense for general x \u2208 Gu . This often makes analyzing regular representations of\nFell bundle C \u2217 -algebras considerably more challenging.\nExample 13. Any representation \u03c0u of Au determines a representation \u03c0u \u25e6 \u01ebu of\nA by composition with evaluation at u (in the direct-integral picture, \u03c0 = \u03c0u \u25e6 \u01ebu\nis a direct integral with respect to the point-mass \u03b4u ). We abuse notation slightly\nand write Ind \u03c0u for Ind(\u03c0u \u25e6 \u01ebu ) which acts on the completion of \u0393c (G; B) \u2299 H\u03c0u\nunder\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(12)\n(\u03c6 \u2297 h | \u03c8 \u2297 k) =\n\u03c0u \u03c8(x)\u2217 \u03c6(x) h(u) | k(u) d\u03bbu (x).\nG\n\nEquation (12) depends only on \u03c6|Gu and \u03c8|Gu ; and conversely each element of\n\u0393c (Gu ; B) is the restriction of some \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393c (G; B) by the Tietz Extension Theorem\nfor upper semicontinuous Fell bundles [16, Proposition A.5]. So we can view the\nspace of Ind \u03c0u as the completion of \u0393c (Gu ; B) \u2299 H\u03c0u with respect to (12).\n5. The equivalence theorem\nFix for this section second-countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids G and\nH with Haar systems \u03bb and \u03b2, a G \u2013 H equivalence Z, Fell bundles pG : B \u2192 G and\npH : C \u2192 H and a B \u2013 C equivalence q : E \u2192 Z. Let \u03ba denote the Haar system on\nL obtained from [22, Remark 11], and let L(q) : L(E ) \u2192 L be the linking bundle\nof Section 3.\nTheorem 14. Suppose that F \u2208 \u0393c (L; L(E )) satisfies f (\u03b6) = 0 for all \u03b6 \u2208 L \\ G.\nLet f := F |G \u2208 \u0393c (G; B). Then kF kC \u2217(L,L(E )) = kf kC \u2217(G;B) and kF kCr\u2217 (L;L(E )) =\nkf kCr\u2217(G;B) . Moreover, pG C \u2217 (L, L(E ))pH is a C \u2217 (G; B) \u2013 C \u2217 (H; C )-imprimitivity\nbimodule, and pG Cr\u2217 (L, L(E ))pH is a Cr\u2217 (G; B) \u2013 Cr\u2217 (H, C )-imprimitivity bimodule\nwhich is the quotient module of pG C \u2217 (L, L(E ))pH by the kernel Ir of the canonical\nhomomorphism of C \u2217 (H, C ) onto Cr\u2217 (H, C ).\nRemark 15. Recall the set-up of Example 10. It is not difficult to see that if G and\nH are groupoids and Z is a G \u2013 H equivalence, then the trivial bundle Z \u00d7 C is a\n(G \u00d7 C) \u2013 (H \u00d7 C) equivalence. Hence we recover Theorem 13, Proposition 15 and\nTheorem 17 of [22] from Theorem 14.\nTo prove Theorem 14, we first establish some preliminary results. Our key technical result is a norm-estimate for the representations of \u0393c (G; B) \u2286 \u0393c (L; L(E ))\ncoming from elements of H 0 .\nLet {\u03c1vZ }v\u2208H (0) be the Radon measures on Z introduced in [22, Theorem 13].\nFor each v \u2208 H (0) , fix \u03b6 \u2208 Z with s(\u03b6) = v, and define a D(v)-valued form on\n\n\f12\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P.

With respect to the pre-inner product (13), Y0 is a pre-Hilbert Dmodule whose completion, Y is a full right Hilbert D-module.\nProof. That (13) takes values in D follows from the observation above that\nh\u03c6 , \u03c8i = (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c8)|L(0) . Since each Ez is an imprimitivity bimodule, the\nD\nrange of h* , *i (v) is all of Dv . Since D is a C0 (H (0) )-algebra, to see that\nD\nX := span{ h\u03c6 , \u03c8i : \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Y0 } = D, it therefore suffices to show that X is a\nD\nC0 (H (0) )-module (see, for example [23, Proposition C.24]), for which one uses the\nright action of C0 (H (0) ) on Y0 to check that (h\u03c6 , \u03c8i * f )(v) := f (v)h\u03c6 , \u03c8i (v)\nD\nD\nis bilinear from X \u00d7 C0 (H (0) ) to X. An argument like that of page 6 shows that\nfor f \u2208 \u0393c (L(0) ; L(q)\u22121 (L(0) )), Mf (\u03c8)(g) := f (r(g))\u03c8(g) determines a multiplier of\nC \u2217 (L; L(E )), so Y0 is a pre-Hilbert D-module which is full since X = D.\n\u0003\nRemark 17. Since D is a C0 (H (0) )-algebra, to each v \u2208 H (0) there corresponds a\nquotient module\nY(v) := Y /Y * Iv ,\nwhere Iv = { d \u2208 D : d(v) = 0 }. As in [21, Proposition 3.25], Y(v) is a right\nHilbert D(v)-module: if we denote by x(v) the image of x in Y(v), then we have\nx(v) , y(v)\n= hx , yi (v). Since kyk2 = khy , yi k, we obtain kyk =\nD(v)\nD\nD\nsupv\u2208H (0) ky(v)k. Indeed, the Y(v) are isomorphic to the modules used in [14,\nProposition 4.3].\nFix T \u2208 L(Y). Since T is D-linear, for each v \u2208 H (0) there is an adjointable operator Tv on Y(v) satisfying Tv (x(v)) = (T x)(v) for all x \u2208 Y. Since\nTv (x(v)) , y(v)\n= hT x , yi (v), we have kT k = supv\u2208H (0) kTv k.\nD(v)\n\nD\n\nProposition 18 ([14, Proposition 4.3]). There is a homomorphism M from\nC \u2217 (G; B) to L(Y) such that if f \u2208 \u0393c (G; B) and \u03c6 \u2208 Y0 , then\nZ\n(14)\nM (f )\u03c6(\u03b6) =\nf (x)\u03c6(x\u22121 * \u03b6) d\u03bbr(\u03b6) (x).\nG\n\nWe have I\nkM (f )k \u2264 kf kr .\n\nCr\u2217 (G;B)\n\n\u2282 ker M , and M factors through Cr\u2217 (G; B).

The restriction to H4 is zero, and H3 is the completion\nof \u0393c (Z; E ) under\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c4v \u03c8(\u03b6) , \u03c6(\u03b6) h | k d\u03c1v (\u03b6).\n(\u03c6 \u2297 h | \u03c8 \u2297 k) =\nC\n\nZ\n\nAn inner-product computation shows that if Y is the Hilbert D-module of\nLemma 16, then H3 is isomorphic to the completion of Y \u2299 H\u03c4v under\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(\u03c6 \u2297 h | \u03c8 \u2297 k) = \u03c4v h\u03c8 , \u03c6i (v) h | k ,\nD\n\nL\n\nand then the restriction of (Ind \u03c4v )(F ) to H3 is Y- Ind \u03c4v . Hence k IndL \u03c4v (F )k =\nkY- Ind \u03c4v (f )k. Since Y- Ind \u03c4v [x \u2297 h] = [M (f )x \u2297 h] for all x, we have ker M \u2282\nker Y- Ind \u03c4v . Hence Proposition 18, implies that kY- Ind \u03c4v (f )k \u2264 kf kCr\u2217 (G;B) as\nrequired.\nThe final statement follows from [21, Theorem 3.22].\n\u0003\n6. The reduced symmetric imprimitivity theorem\n\nSuppose that K and H are locally compact groups acting freely and properly\non the left and right, respectively, of a locally compact space P . Suppose also that\nwe have commuting actions \u03b1 and \u03b2 of K and H, respectively, on a C \u2217 -algebra\nP\nD. Then we can form the induced algebras IndP\nH (D, \u03b2) and IndK (D, \u03b1) and get\ndynamical systems\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c3\u030c : K \u2192 Aut IndP\nand \u03c4\u030c : H \u2192 Aut IndP\nH (D, \u03b2)\nK (D, \u03b1)\n\nfor the diagonal actions as in [23, Lemma 3.54]. Then Raeburn's Symmetric Imprimitivity Theorem says that the crossed products\nIndP\nH (D, \u03b2) \u22ca\u03c3\u030c K\n\nand\n\nIndP\nK (D, \u03b1) \u22ca\u03c4\u030c H\n\nare Morita equivalent. In [19], Quigg and Spielberg proved that Raeburn's Morita\nequivalence passed to the reduced crossed products. (Kasparov had a different\nproof in [12, Theorem 3.15] and an Huef and Raeburn gave a different proof of the\nQuigg and Spielberg result in [9, Corollary 3].)\nWe consider the corresponding statements for groupoid dynamical systems. Let\n(A , G, \u03b1) be a groupoid dynamical system as in [17, \u00a74]. Recall that the associated\ncrossed product A \u22ca\u03b1 G is a completion of \u0393c (G; r\u2217 A ). If \u03c0 is a representation\nof A := \u03930 (G(0) ; A ), then the associated regular representation of A \u22ca\u03b1 G is the\nrepresentation L\u03c0 := IndA \u03c0 acting on L2 (G \u2217 Hs , \u03bd \u22121 ) as in (11). The reduced\ncrossed product, A \u22ca\u03b1,r G is the quotient of A \u22ca\u03b1 G by the common kernel of the\n\n\fFELL NOTES\n\n15\n\nL\u03c0 with \u03c0 faithful. Let B := r\u2217 A with the semidirect product Fell bundle structure\nso that C \u2217 (G, B) is isomorphic to A \u22ca\u03b1 G, then it follows from Example 11 that\nCr\u2217 (G, B) is isomorphic to the reduced crossed product A \u22ca\u03b1,r G.\nNow let H be a locally compact group and let X be a locally compact Hausdorff\nH-space. Let G be the transformation groupoid G = H \u00d7 X. As in [17, Example 4.8], suppose that A = \u03930 (X; A ) is a C0 (X)-algebra, and define lt : H \u2192\nAut(C0 (X)) by lth (\u03c6)(x) := \u03c6(h\u22121 * x). Suppose that \u03b2 : H \u2192 Aut A is a C \u2217 dynamical system such that\n\u03b2h (\u03c6 * a) = lth (\u03c6) * \u03b2h (a)\n\nfor h \u2208 H, \u03c6 \u2208 C0 (X) and a \u2208 A.\n\nThen, following [17, Example 4.8], we obtain a groupoid dynamical system\n(A , G, \u03b1) where\n\u0001\n\u03b1(h,x) a(h\u22121 * x) = \u03b2h (a)(x).\n\nLet \u2206 be the modular function on H. Then the map \u03a6 : Cc (H, A) \u2192 \u0393c (G; r\u2217 A )\ngiven by\n1\n\n\u03a6(f )(h, x) = \u2206(h) 2 f (h)(x)\nextends to an isomorphism of A \u22ca\u03b2 H with A \u22ca\u03b1 G.\nFix a representation \u03c0 of A. By decomposing \u03c0 as a direct integral over X\none checks that (f \u2297\u03c0 \u03be|g \u2297\u03c0 \u03b7) = (\u03a6(f ) \u2297\u03c0 \u03be|\u03a6(g) \u2297\u03c0 \u03b7) for f, g \u2208 Cc (G, A) and\n\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 H\u03c0 . We use this to show that U (f \u2297 h) = \u03a6(f ) \u2297 h determines a unitary from\nthe space of the regular representation IndA \u03c0 of A \u22ca\u03b2 H to the space of the regular\nrepresentation IndA \u03c0 of A \u22ca\u03b1 G which intertwines IndA \u03c0(f ) and IndA \u03c0(\u03a6(f ))\nfor all f . Therefore \u03a6 factors through an isomorphism A \u22ca\u03b2,r H \u223c\n= A \u22ca\u03b1,r G.\nNow, back to the set-up of Raeburn's Symmetric Imprimitivity Theorem. Since\nIndP\nH (D, \u03b2) is a C0 (P/H)-algebra, it is the section algebra of a bundle B over\nP/H. It is shown in [17, Example 5.12] that there is a groupoid action \u03c3 of the\ntransformation groupoid K \u00d7 P/H on B such that\n\u223c\nIndP\nH (D, \u03b2) \u22ca\u03c3\u030c K = B \u22ca\u03c3 (K \u00d7 P/H).\nSimilarly,\n\u223c\nIndP\nK (D, \u03b1) \u22ca\u03c4\u030c H = A \u22ca\u03c4 (K\\P \u22ca H)\nfor an appropriate bundle A over K\\P and action \u03c4 . Furthermore, the trivial\nbundle E := P \u00d7A is an equivalence between (B, K \u00d7P/H, \u03c3) and (A , K\\P \u00d7H, \u03c4 )\nin the sense of [17, Definition 5.1]. (Thus Raeburn's Symmetric Imprimitivity\nTheorem is a special case of [17, Theorem 5.5].) Therefore the Quigg-Spielberg\nresult follows from following corollary of our main theorem.\nCorollary 19. Suppose that q : E \u2192 Z is an equivalence between the groupoid\ndynamical systems (B, H, \u03b2) and (A , G, \u03b1). Then the Morita equivalence of [17,\nTheorem 5.5] factors through a Morita equivalence of the reduced crossed products\nB \u22ca\u03b2,r H and A \u22ca\u03b1,r G.\nProof. Recall that r\u2217 A := {(a, x) \u2208 A \u00d7 G : r(a) = r(x)} is a Fell bundle over\nG with bundle map (a, x) 7\u2192 x, multiplication (a, x)(b, y) = (a\u03b1x (b), xy) and involution (a, x)\u2217 = (\u03b1x\u22121 (a), x\u22121 ) (see [16, Example 2.1]), and similarly for r \u2217 B.\nDefine maps r\u2217 A \u2217 E \u2192 E and E \u2217 r\u2217 B \u2192 E by\n(a, g) * a := a * \u03b1g (a)\n\nand\n\na * (b, h) := \u03b2h (a) * b.\n\n\f16\n\nAIDAN SIMS AND DANA P. WILLIAMS\n\nDefine pairings\n\nh* , *i : E \u2217s E \u2192 A and h* , *i \u2217 : E \u2217r E \u2192 B by\n\nr\u2217 A\n\nr B\n\nha , bi = ha , \u03b1G [q(a),q(b)] (b)i\n\nr\u2217 A\n\nAr(a)\n\nha , bi \u2217 = ha , \u03b2[q(a),q(b)]H (b)i\nr B\n\nAr(a)\n\n, G [q(a), q(b)]\n\n\u0001\n\nand\n\n\u0001\n, [q(a), q(b)]H .\n\nIt is routine though tedious to show that E is an r\u2217 A \u2013 r\u2217 B equivalence.\nThe Morita equivalence X of [17, Theorem 5.5] and the Morita equivalence\npG C \u2217 (L, L(E ))pH of Theorem 14 are both completions of \u0393c (Z; E ). From the formulae for the actions of r\u2217 A on E , we see that the identity map on \u0393c (Z; E)\ndetermines a left-module map from X to pG C \u2217 (L, L(E ))pH , and similarly on the\nright. So it suffices to show that the norms on X and on pG C \u2217 (L, L(E ))pH coincide. For this, observe that the formula [17, Equation (5.1)] for the A \u00d7\u03b1 G-valued\ninner-product on \u0393c (Z; E ) is precisely the convolution formula for multiplication\nof the corresponding elements of \u0393c (L; L(E )) with respect to the Haar system \u03ba\ndescribed in [22].\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nA.
