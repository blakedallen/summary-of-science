Measuring the superlattice peak associated with TiO6 octahedra rotation in the low temperature tetragonal phase indicates the presence\nof a phase transition whose critical temperature is a strong function of strain, with TC as much as\n50K above the corresponding bulk temperature. Surprisingly, the lattice constants evolve smoothly\nthrough the transition with no indication of a phase change. This signals an important change in\nthe nature of the phase transition due to the epitaxy strain and substrate clamping effect. The\ninternal degrees of freedom (TiO6 rotations) have become uncoupled from the overall lattice shape.\n\nPerovskite films have received a great deal of interest\nlately due to the potential for creating working technologies based on a variety of interesting properties such as\nhigh-TC superconductivity, colossal magneto-resistivity,\nferro-electricity, and variable dielectric constants. These\nproperties can be quite different in thin films versus nominally similar bulk samples. The primary reasons for the\nchanges in properties are believed to be strain and defects. There is also an emerging theoretical effort to treat\nthe effects of strain. To understand the mechanisms for\nthese changes we must be able to conduct detailed microscopic measurements of the atomic and electronic structure.\nSrTiO3 (STO) is a nearly ferroelectric material with\na large dielectric nonlinearity and low dielectric loss at\ncryogenic temperature, making it ideal for tunable microwave devices[1]. STO is also a good model system for studying structural phase transitions. Bulk\nSTO crystals are cubic at room temperature, with space\ngroup Pm3m(O1h ), but become tetragonal, space group\nI4/mcm(D18\n4h ), below about 105K. This phase transition\ninvolves the rotation of TiO6 octahedra and has been\nfeatured historically in the study of structural phase\ntransitions as the classic example of a soft-mode phase\ntransition[2]. The unit cell of the tetragonal phase has a\nvolume four times that\nthe cubic unit cell, with approx\u221a of\u221a\nimate unit cell of 2a\u00d7 2a\u00d72a, where a is the lattice\nparameter of cubic unit cell. In this paper we describe\nthe tetragonal phase as pseudo-cubic, in order to compare the structure before and after the phase transition.\nIn this pseudo-cubic frame, the tetragonal phase has additional superlattice peaks at half integer index positions.\nThese superlattice peaks disappear as the temperature is\nraised through the tetragonal-cubic phase transition.\n\n\u2217 Present\n\nAddress: HASYLAB at DESY, Notkestr. 85, 22603 Hamburg, Germany\n\nIn the bulk, the deviation from cubic symmetry is directly related to the rotation angle of the TiO6 octahedra. This rotation angle has been identified as the order\nparameter for this phase transition[3]. Correspondingly,\nthe intensities of the superlattice peaks are proportional\nto the square of the order parameter and can be used to\ntrack the phase transition.\nFor a second-order structural phase transition, usually\nthe volume of the unit cell changes smoothly through\nthe transition temperature, but lattice parameter versus\ntemperature curves have a sudden change in slope. This\nis the case for bulk STO[4][5]. For epitaxial films the inplane lattice parameters are subject to lateral restraint\nfrom the substrate and therefore do not have the freedom to change as in bulk. In this paper we show that\nfor epitaxial films of STO the lattice parameters are indeed constrained though this does not completely inhibit\nthe occurrence of the soft-mode phase transition. The\nstrains do change both the transition temperature and\nthe nature of the transition.\nThe films studied were STO films grown on (001)\nLaAlO3 (LAO) single crystal substrate with SrRuO3\n(SRO) buffer layers. The samples were grown using the\nPulsed Laser Deposition technique with details described\nelsewhere[6]. X-ray diffraction implies excellent epitaxy\nwith average mosaics around 0.2 degrees and no detectable misoriented regions. Several different measurements of films grown in the same system under the same\nconditions have been reported elsewhere[7][8]. All of the\nsamples were of the type STO/SRO/LAO with variations\nof either the STO or SRO thickness. The main study\nconsisted of STO films with thickness varying from 50 to\n1000nm on a SRO-buffer layer 350nm thick. A secondary\nstudy investigated STO films 200nm thick on SRO buffer\nlayers with thickness from 0 to 350nm. X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements were carried out at beamline X22A at the\nNational Synchrotron Lights Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. X22A has a bent Si(111) monochromator, giving a small beam spot and fixed incident pho-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (a) (1/2. 1/2, 7/2) peaks of STO and SRO at different\ntemperature, (b) intensity of STO superlattice peak versus\ntemperature.\n\nton energy of 10 keV. The longitudinal resolution with a\nSi(111) analyzer was at least 0.001\u00c5\u22121 (HWHM) for an\n(0,0,2) peak, as measured from the LAO substrate. Below room temperature the sample was cooled in a closed\ncycle refrigerator with a temperature control of \u00b10.5\u00b0.\nWe choose the coordinate system such that the axis\nnormal to the film surface is the c axis. Like bulk STO,\nall of our STO films have extra half-integer superlattice\npeaks at low temperature. The intensity of these peaks\ndecreases as the temperature rises and the peaks vanish at 130\u223c170K for different samples. Thus the STO\nfilms also have a phase transition with similar symmetry change as seen in the bulk. Fig. 1 shows an example of such a superlattice peak for a [1000nm STO\n/ 350nm SRO] sample. In the first panel are raw data\nscans through the (1/2, 1/2, 7/2) peak at some representative temperatures. The presence of a superlattice\npeak for SRO is a result of its structural phase transition\noccuring at \u223c800K. The STO and SRO peaks are well\nresolved and the STO peak intensity decreases with increasing temperature. Fig. 1 panel (b) is a summary plot\nof the peak intensity versus temperature. Compared to\nthe bulk, the intensity versus temperature curve is shifted\ntowards higher temperature. The intensity does not fall\nabruptly to zero but includes a tail that extends to higher\ntemperature. This indicates that the phase transition is\nrounded and occurs over a range of temperature. This\nrounded transition is most likely due to the presence of a\nrange of local strains within the film. Due to the rounding of the transition, we need to derive a method for\nextracting the average TC . We extrapolate the linear\nportion of the curve between 10% to 40% maximum in-\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Temperature dependence of peak intensity for\nSTO films of different thickness, (b) detail of (a), shows the\nchange of temperature of phase transition, \u2206TC , (c) temperature dependence of peak intensity for STO films on different\nbuffer layers.\n\ntensity and define the transition temperature as where\nthis line crosses the zero intensity. The use of a linear\nfunction is justified by the data itself as well as previous\nwork that has found a power law coefficient b very close\nto one for this phase transition in bulk samples[9]. While\nthis method may produce TC too high by a few degrees\n(<5K), it allows for an accurate comparison of TC between different films. We believe we can determine \u2206TC\nto about 0.5K.\nFor samples with a 350nm SRO buffer layer and varying STO thickness, TC increases monotonically with inplane strain as shown in Fig. 2(a), and in more detail\nin Fig. 2(b). The difference, \u2206TC , is about 14K (or\n\u2206TC /TC \u223c10%) between the 1000nm STO sample and\n50nm sample although the in-plane strain at room temperature measured by glancing incidence x-ray diffraction\n(not shown) only changes from 0.01% to 0.23%. The thinner film, with greater strain, has the higher TC , while\nthicker film has TC close to the bulk value. Thus the\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: The temperature dependence of STO lattice parameter c, shows no abrupt change through the whole range.\n\nstructural phase transition is very sensitive to the biaxial\nstrain caused by the lattice mismatch at the interface,\nwith the ratio (\u2206TC /TC )/\u03b5 \u223c45, where \u03b5 is the in-plane\nstrain.\nWe also studied a series of samples with the same\n200nm STO layer but varying the thickness of SRO buffer\nlayer. Here we observed even larger effect of strain on TC ,\nas shown in Fig. 2(c). In this case the largest strains and\nthe largest shifts in TC appear for SRO buffer layers of\nintermediate thickness. We believe this is due to the complexity of the SRO domain structure. The highest TC is\nin the sample with a 20nm SRO buffer layer. In this\ncase, TC is shifted about 30K above the STO film on a\n350nm buffer and about 40K above the most bulk like of\nour films [1000nm STO / 350nm SRO]. Clearly the overall rise in TC can be quite large. Further detail will be\ngiven in a follow up paper[10], that also includes a discussion of the temperature-strain phase diagram which\nhas been theoretically predicted[11].\nAlthough from the presence of the superlattice peaks\nwe can see that there is a phase transition near 130K, the\nout-of-plane lattice constants evolve smoothly through\nthe transition temperature with no indication of the transition. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 for the 200nm STO\n/ 350nm SRO film. The variation in lattice constant\nis merely the thermal expansion with no indication of\na phase transition. This is obviously different from the\nbulk STO where a sudden slope change is clearly seen at\n105K[5][12]. We ascribe this effect to the clamping effect\nof the substrate upon the film. The film in-plane lattice\nparameters are not free to move to their bulk equilibrium\nvalues because they are tied to the substrate lattice. Our\nexperiments show that the overall film is tetragonal at\nall temperatures measured. However this doesn't prevent\nthe TiO6 octahedra from rotating and ordering leading\nto a reduced symmetry phase. In fact the tetragonal cell\nshape seems to favor the rotation of TiO6 octahedra, stabilizing the lower symmetry phase and enhancing TC .\nIt is a remarkable that the phase transition in the STO\nfilms involves a lowering of the internal symmetry due to\nTiO6 octahedra rotations without a change in the unit\ncell size and shape. This unique phase transition man-\n\nifests a decoupling of the internal degree of freedom of\nTiO6 rotation and the external degree of freedom of the\nunit cell dimensions. Such a difference between the nature of structural phase transitions in epitaxial films and\nbulk materials may occur in many situations and should\nbe considered in analyzing a variety of results.\nRaman scattering experiments on similar films have\nstudied the temperature dependence of the structural\nR modes, which are Raman active only below TC [13].\nIn bulk STO these phonons disappear at 105K, while in\nthin films their intensity vanishes at about 120\u00b15K. The\nmode is detectable in Raman upon the doubling of the\nunit cell thus folding this mode back to the zone center.\nThis change is dependent upon the rotation of the octahedra and not the presence of a tetragonal unit cell. In\ncontrast, dielectric measurements show obvious thickness\ndependence and the temperature range over which the dielectric constant is tunable by an electric field is vastly\nincreased versus the bulk[8]. The empirical evidence suggests that this behavior is connected to the presence of a\ntetragonal unit cell.\nA review of the literature reveals that a similar effect\nmay exist in BaTiO3 (BTO) films. Bulk BTO has a series of phase transitions at 183K, 278K and 403K, at each\nof which the lattice constants change drastically. All of\nthe lower temperature phases are ferroelectric. In contrast, lattice parameter measurements of epitaxial films\nshow no abrupt changes in either the a or c constant,\nwhich both increase roughly linearly with temperature\nfrom 15K to 800K[14]. However, it appears from electrical measurements that the ferroelectric phase transition still occurs in similar BTO films on a Pt/MgO\nsubstrate[15][16]. Ferroelectricity is due to the shift of\nposition of the Ti ion with respect to the O octahedron\nsurrounding it, not the cubic to tetragonal change in the\nunit cell. Thus ferroelectricity is due to the internal degree of freedom of the phase transition. The ferroelectric\ntransition in BTO films seems to be another example of\nan epitaxy strain and substrate clamping effect that permits a phase transition in the internal atomic arrangements (ferroelectricity) but does not allow external dimension changes.\nIt appears that the decoupling of the internal and external aspects of a phase transition in films is not universal. One example is NdNiO3 . Both bulk and films\nof this material have a metal-insulator transition around\n200K. Recent x-ray diffraction measurements on epitaxial films of NdNiO3 on LaAlO3 have shown that the out\nof plane lattice constant exhibits a sudden change at the\ntransition[17]. Further experiments are ongoing to try\nto determine what makes the two transitions fundamentally different with respect to the clamping effect of the\nsubstrate and the relaxation of the overall unit cell dimensions.\nWe acknowledge S.
