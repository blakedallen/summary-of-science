This fact (independence of the coefficients+isotropy\u21d2Gaussianity)\nis not true for isotropic random fields on other structures, as the torus or Z (which are situations\non which the action is Abelian).\nThis property implies in particular that non Gaussian rotationally invariant random fields on the\nsphere cannot be simulated using independent coefficients.\n\n1\n\n\fIn this note we show that this is a typical phenomenon for homogeneous spaces of compact nonAbelian groups. This should be intended as a contribution to a much more complicated issue, i.e.\nthe characterization of the isotropy of a random field in terms of its random Fourier expansion.\nIn \u00a72 and 3 we review some background material on harmonic analysis and spectral representations for random fields. \u00a74 contains the main results, whereas we moved to \u00a75 an auxiliary\nproposition.\n\n2\n\nThe Peter-Weyl decomposition\n\nLet X be a compact topological space and G a compact group acting on X transitively. We\ndenote by mG the Haar measure of G. We know that there exists on X a probability measure m\nthat is invariant by the action of G, noted x \u2192 g \u22121 x, g \u2208 G. We assume that both m and mG are\nnormalized and have total mass equal to 1. We shall write L2 (X ) or simply L2 instead of L2 (X , m).\nUnless otherwise stated the spaces L2 are spaces of complex valued square integrable functions. We\ndenote by Lg the action of G on L2 , that is Lg f (x) = f (g \u22121 x).\nc be the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G which occur\nLet X\nin the decomposition of L2 (X , m). Since the action of G commutes with the complex conjugation\non L2 (X , m), it is clear that for any irreducible subspace H, H, its conjugate subspace is also\nirreducible. If H = H, we can find orthonormal bases (\u03c6k ) for H which are stable under conjugation;\nfor instance we can choose the \u03c6k to be real. If H 6= H, then there are two cases according as the\naction of G on H is, or is not, equivalent to the action on H. If the two actions are inequivalent, then\nautomatically H \u22a5 H. If the actions are equivalent, it is possible that H and H are not orthogonal\nto each other. In this case H \u2229 H = 0 as both are irreducible and S = H + H is stable under G and\nconjugation. In this case we can find K \u2282 S stable under G and irreducible such that K \u22a5 K and\nS = K \u2295 K is an orthogonal direct sum. The proof of this is postponed to the Appendix so as not\nto interrupt the main flow of the argument. We thus obtain the following orthogonal decomposition\nof L2 (X , m), compatible with complex conjugation:\nM\nM\nL2 (X , m) =\nHi \u2295\n(Hi \u2295 Hi )\n(2.1)\ni\u2208I o\n\ni\u2208I +\n\nwhere the direct sums are orthogonal and\ni \u2208 I o \u21d4 Hi = H i ,\n\ni \u2208 I + \u21d4 Hi \u22a5 H i .\n\nWe can therefore choose an orthonormal basis (\u03c6ik ) for L2 (X , m) such that for i \u2208 I o , (\u03c6ik )1\u2264k\u2264di\nis an orthonormal basis of Hi stable under conjugation, while, for i \u2208 I + , (\u03c6ik )1\u2264k\u2264di is an orthonormal basis for Hi , where di is the dimension of Hi ; then, for i \u2208 I + , (\u03c6ik )1\u2264k\u2264di is an\northonormal basis for H i . Such a orthonormal basis (\u03c6ik )ik of L2 (X , m) is said to be compatible\nwith complex conjugation.\nb = Z and Hk , k \u2208 Z is generated by the\nExample 2.1 X = S1 , the one dimensional torus. Here G\nik\u03b8\nfunction \u03b3k (\u03b8) = e . H k = H\u2212k and H k \u22a5 Hk for k 6= 0. All of the Hk 's are one-dimensional.\n\nRecall that the irreducible representations of a compact topological group G are all one-dimensional\nif and only if G is Abelian.\n\nExample 2.2 G = SO(3), X = S2 , the sphere. A popular choice of a basis of L2 (X , m) are the\nspherical harmonics, (Yl,m )\u2212l\u2264m\u2264l , l \u2208 N (see [VK91]). Hl = span((Yl,m )\u2212l\u2264m\u2264l ) are subspaces of\nL2 (X , m) on which G acts irreducibly. We have Y l,m = (\u22121)m Yl,\u2212m and Yl,0 is real.\nBy choosing \u03c6l,m = Yl,m for m \u2265 0 and \u03c6l,m = (\u22121)m Yl,m for m < 0, we find a basis of Hl such\nthat if \u03c6 is an element of the basis, then the same is true for \u03c6. Here dim(Hl ) = 2l + 1, H l = Hl ,\nso that in the decomposition (2.1) there are no subspaces of the form Hi for I + .\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion\n\nWe consider on X a real centered square integrable random field (T (x))x\u2208X . We assume that there\nexists a probability space (\u03a9, F , P ) on which the r.v.'s T (x) are defined and that (x, \u03c9) \u2192 T (x, \u03c9)\nis B(X ) \u2297 F measurable, B(X ) denoting the Borel \u03c3-field of X . We assume that\nhZ\ni\nE\nT (x)2 dm(x) = M < +\u221e\n(3.2)\nX\n\nwhich in particular entails that x \u2192 Tx (\u03c9) belongs to L2 (m) a.s. Let us recall the main elementary\nfacts concerning the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion for such fields. We can associate to T the bilinear\nform on L2 (m)\nZ\nhZ\ni\nT (f, g) = E\nT (y)g(y) dm(y)\n(3.3)\nT (x)f (x) dm(x)\nX\n\nX\n\nBy (3.2) and the Schwartz inequality one gets easily that\n|T (f, g)| \u2264 M kf k2 kgk2 .\nTherefore, by the Riesz representation theorem there exists a function R \u2208 L2 (X \u00d7 X , m \u2297 m) such\nthat\nZ\nf (x)g(y)R(x, y) dm(x)dm(y) .\nT (f, g) =\nX \u00d7X\n\nWe can therefore define a continuous linear operator R : L2 (m) \u2192 L2 (m)\nZ\nR(x, y)f (y) dm(y) .\nRf (x) =\nX\n\nIt can be even be proved that the linear operator R is of trace class and therefore compact (see\n[Par05] for details). Since it is self-adjoint there exists an orthonormal basis of L2 (X , m) that is\nformed by eigenvectors of R.\nLet us define, for \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (X , m),\nZ\nT (x)\u03c6(x) dm(x) ,\na(\u03c6) =\nX\n\nLet \u03bb be an eigenvalue of R and denote by E\u03bb the corresponding eigenspace. Then the following is\nwell-known.\nProposition 3.3 Let \u03c6 \u2208 E\u03bb .\na) If \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (X , m) is orthogonal to \u03c6, a(\u03c8) is orthogonal to a(\u03c6) in L2 (\u03a9, P). Moreover\nE[|a(\u03c8)|2 ] = \u03bbk\u03c8k22 .\nb) If \u03c6 is orthogonal to \u03c6, then the r.v.'s Ra(\u03c6) and Ia(\u03c6) are orthogonal and have the same\nvariance.\nc) If the field T is Gaussian, a(\u03c6) is a Gaussian r.v. If moreover \u03c6 is orthogonal to \u03c6, then a(\u03c6)\nis a complex centered Gaussian r.v. (that is Rai and Iai are centered, Gaussian, independent and\nhave the same variance).\nProof. a) We have\nE[a(\u03c6)a(\u03c8)] = E\n=\n\nZ\n\nX \u00d7X\n\nZ\n\nhZ\n\nT (x)\u03c6(x) dm(x)\nX\nZ\nR(x, y)\u03c6(x)\u03c8(y) dm(x) dm(y) = \u03bb\n3\n\nX\n\ni\nT (y)\u03c8(y) dm(y) =\n\u03c6(y)\u03c8(y) dm(y) = \u03bbh\u03c6, \u03c8i .\n\nX\n\n\fFrom this relation, by choosing first \u03c8 orthogonal to \u03c6 and then \u03c8 = \u03c6, the statement follows.\nb) From the computation in a), as a(\u03c6) = a(\u03c6), one gets E[a(\u03c6)2 ] = \u03bbh\u03c6, \u03c6i. Therefore, if \u03c6 is\northogonal to \u03c6, E[a(\u03c6)2 ] = 0 which is equivalent to Ra(\u03c6) and Ia(\u03c6) being orthogonal and having\nthe same variance.\nc) It is immediate that a(\u03c6) is Gaussian. If \u03c6 is orthogonal to \u03c6, a(\u03c6) is a complex centered\nGaussian r.v., thanks to b).\n\u0004\nIf (\u03c6k )k is an orthonormal basis that is formed by eigenvectors of R, then under the assumption\n(3.2) it is well-known that the following expansion holds\nT (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(\u03c6k )\u03c6k (x)\n\n(3.4)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich is called the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion. This is intended in the sense of L2 (X , m) a.s. in \u03c9.\nStronger assumptions (continuity in square mean of x \u2192 T (x), e.g.) ensure also that the convergence\ntakes place in L2 (\u03a9, P) for every x (see [SW86], p.210 e.g.)\nMore relevant properties are true if we assume in addition that the random field is invariant\nby the action G. Recall that the field T is said to be (weakly) invariant by the action of G if, for\nfi , . . . fm \u2208 L2 (X ) the joint laws of (T (f1 ), . . . , T (fm )) and (T (Lg f1 ), . . . , T ((Lg fm )) are equal for\nevery g \u2208 G. Here we write\nZ\nT (f ) =\nT (x)f (x) dm(x),\nf \u2208 L2 (X ) .\nX\n\nIf, in addition, the field is assumed to be continuous in sqare mean, this imples that for every\nx1 , . . . , xm \u2208 X , (T (x1 ), . . . , T (xm )) and (T (g \u22121 x1 ), . . . , T (g \u22121 xm )), have the same joint laws for\nevery g \u2208 G. If the field is invariant then it is immediate that the covariance function R enjoys the\ninvariance property\nR(x, y) = R(g \u22121 x, g \u22121 y)\na.e. for every g \u2208 G\n(3.5)\nwhich also reads as\nLg (Rf ) = R(Lg f ) .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThen, thanks to (3.6), it is clear that G acts on E\u03bb . Therefore E\u03bb is the direct sum of some of\nthe Hi 's introduced in the previous section. Moreover it is a finite direct sum, unless \u03bb = 0, as the\neigenvalues of a compact operator that are different from 0 cannot have but a finite multiplicity. It\nturns out therefore that the basis (\u03c6ik )ik of L2 introduced in the previous section is always formed\nby eigenvectors of R.\nMoreover, if some of the Hi 's are of dimension > 1, some of the eigenvalues of R have necessarily a\nmultiplicity that is strictly larger than 1. As pointed out in \u00a72, this phenomenon is related to the non\ncommutativity of G. For more details on the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion and group representations\nsee [PP05].\nRemark that if the random field is isotropic and satisfies (3.2), then (3.4) follows by the PeterWeyl theorem. Actually (3.2) entails that, for almost every \u03c9, x \u2192 T (x) belongs to L2 (X , m).\nRemark 3.4 An important issue when dealing with isotropic random fields is simulation. In this\nregard, a natural starting point is the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion: one can actually sample random\nr.v.'s \u03b1(\u03c6k ), (centered and standardized) and write\nTn (x) =\n\nn p\nX\n\u03bbk \u03b1(\u03c6k )\u03c6k\n\nk=1\n\n4\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fwhere the sequence (\u03bbk )k is summable. The point of course is what conditions, in addition to those\nalready pointed out, should be imposed in order that (3.7) defines an isotropic field. In order to\nhave a real field, it will be necessary that\n\u03b1(\u03c6k ) = \u03b1(\u03c6k )\n\n(3.8)\n\nOur main result (see next section) is that if the \u03b1(\u03c6k )'s are independent r.v.'s (abiding nonetheless\nto condition (3.8)), then the coefficients, and therefore the field itself are Gaussian.\nIf Hi \u2282 L2 (X , m) is a subspace on which G acts irreducibly, then one can consider the random field\nX\na(\u03c6j )\u03c6j (x)\nTHi (x) =\nwhere the \u03c6j are an orthonormal basis of Hi . As remarked before, all functions in Hi are eigenvectors\nof R associated to the same eigenvalue \u03bb.\nPutting together this fact with (3.4) and (2.1) we obtain the decomposition\nX\nX\nT =\nTHi\u25e6 +\n(TH + + TH \u2212 ) .\ni\n\ni\u2208I \u25e6\n\ni\n\ni\u2208I +\n\nExample 3.5 Let T be a centered random field satisfying assumption (3.2) over the torus T, whose\nKarhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion is\n+\u221e\nX\nT (\u03b8) =\nak eik\u03b8 ,\n\u03b8\u2208T.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThen, if T is invariant by the action of T itself, the fields (T (\u03b8))\u03b8 and (T (\u03b8+\u03b8\u2032 ))\u03b8 are equi-distributed,\nwhich implies that the two sequences of r.v.'s\n(ak )\u2212\u221e<k<+\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n(eik\u03b8 ak )\u2212\u221e<k<+\u221e\n\nand\n\n(3.9)\n\nhave the same finite distribution for every \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 T. Actually one can restrict the attention to the\ncoefficients (ak )0\u2264k<+\u221e , as necessarily a\u2212k = ak .\nConversely it is clear that if the two sequences in (3.9) have the same distribution for every\n\u03b8\u2032 \u2208 T, then the field is invariant.\nCondition (3.9) implies in particular that, for every k, \u2212\u221e < k < +\u221e, k 6= 0 the distribution of\nak must be invariant by rotation (i.e. by the multiplication of a complex number of modulus 1).\nIf one assumes moreover that the r.v.'s ak , are independent, then every choice of a distribution\nfor ak , 0 < k < +\u221e that is rotationally invariant gives rise to a random field that is invariant with\nrespect to the action of T.\n\n4 Independent coefficients and non-Abelian groups\nIn this section we prove our main results showing that, if the group G is non commutative and\nunder some mild additional assumptions, independence of the coefficients of the Fourier development\nimplies their Gaussianity and, therefore, also that the random field must be Gaussian. We stress\nthat we do not assume independence of the real and imaginary parts of the random coefficients.\nProposition 4.6 Let X be an homogeneous space of the compact group G. Let Hi+ \u2282 L2 (X , m)\nbe a subspace on which G acts irreducibly, having a dimension \u2265 2 and such that if f \u2208 Hi+ then\nf 6\u2208 Hi+ . Let (\u03c6k )k be an orthonormal basis of Hi+ and consider the random field\nX\nTH + (x) =\nak \u03c6k (x) .\ni\n\nk\n\n5\n\n\ffor a family of r.v.'s (ak )k \u2282 L2 (\u03a9, P). Then, if the r.v.'s ai are independent, the field TH + is\ni\nG-invariant if and only if the r.v.'s (ak )k are jointly Gaussian and E(|ak |2 ) = c (and therefore also\nthe field TH + is Gaussian).\ni\n\nProof. Since G acts irreducibly on Hi+ , we have\n\u03c6k (g \u22121 x) =\n\ndi\nX\n\nDk,l (g)\u03c6l (x) ,\n\nl=1\n\ndi being the dimension of Hi+ and D(g) being the representative matrix of the action of g \u2208 G.\nTherefore\ndi\nX\nT (g \u22121 x) =\n\u00e3l \u03c6l (x)\nl=1\n\nwhere\n\u00e3l =\n\ndi\nX\n\nDk,l (g)ak .\n\nk=1\n\nIf the field is G-invariant, then the vectors (\u00e3l )l have the same joint distribution as (ak )k and in\nparticular the (\u00e3l )l are independent. One can then apply the Skitovich-Darmois theorem below (see\n[KLR73] e.g.) as soon as it is proved that g \u2208 G can be chosen so that Dk,l (g) 6= 0 for every k, l.\nThis will follow from the considerations below, where it is proved that the set Zk,l of the zeros of\nDk,l has measure zero.\nIndeed, let G1 be the image of G in the representation space so that G1 is also a connected\ncompact group, and is moreover a Lie group since it is a closed subgroup of the unitary group U(di ).\nIf the representation is non trivial, then G1 6= {1} and in fact has positive dimension, and the Dk,l\nare really functions on G1 . For any fixed k, l the irreducibility of the action of G1 implies that Dk,l\nis not identically zero. Indeed, if this were not the case, we must have (g\u03c6l , \u03c6k ) = 0 for all g \u2208 G1 ,\nso that the span of the g\u03c6l is orthogonal to \u03c6k ; this span, being G1 -invariant and nonzero, must be\nthe whole space by the irreducibility, and so we have a contradiction.\nSince Dkl is a nonSzero analytic function on G1 , it follows from standard results that Zkl has\nmeasure zero. Hence kl Zkl has measure zero also, and so its complement in G1 is non empty.\n\u0004\nWe use the following version of the Skitovich-Darmois theorem, which was actually proved by\nS. G. Ghurye and I. Olkin [GO62] (see also [KLR73]).\nTheorem 4.7 Let X1 , . . . , Xr be mutually independent random vectors in Rn . If the linear statistics\nL1 =\n\nr\nX\n\nL2 =\n\nAj Xj ,\n\nj=1\n\nr\nX\n\nBj X j ,\n\nj=1\n\nare independent for some real nonsingular n \u00d7 n matrices Aj , Bj , j = 1, . . . , r, then each of the\nvectors X1 , . . . , Xr is normally distributed.\nWe now investigate the case of the random field TH , when H is a subspace such that H = H. In\nthis case we can consider a basis of the form \u03c6\u2212k , . . . , \u03c6k , k \u2264 l, with \u03c6\u2212k = \u03c6k . The basis may\ncontain a real function \u03c60 , if dim H is odd. Let us assume that the random coefficients ak , k \u2265 0\nare independent. Recall that a\u2212k = ak .\n\n6\n\n\fThe argument can be implemented along the same lines as in Proposition 4.6. More precisely, if\nm1 \u2265 0, m2 \u2265 0, the two complex r.v.'s\ne\nam1 =\ne\nam2 =\n\nl\nX\n\nDm,m1 (g)am\n\nm=\u2212l\nl\nX\n\n(4.10)\nDm,m2 (g)am\n\nm=\u2212l\n\nhave the same joint distribution as am1 and am2 . Therefore, if m1 6= m2 , they are independent.\nMoreover a\u2212m = am , so that the previous relation can be written\ne\nam1 = D0m1 (g)a0 +\n\nl \u0010\n\u0011\nX\nDm,m1 (g)am + D\u2212m,m1 (g)am\n\nm=1\n\ne\nam2 = D0,m2 (g)a0 +\n\nl \u0010\nX\n\nDm,m2 (g)am + D\u2212m,m2 (g)am\n\nm=1\n\n\u0011\n\nIn order to apply the Skitovich-Darmois theorem, we must ensure that g \u2208 G can be chosen so that\nthe real linear applications\nm = 1, . . . , l, i = 1, 2\n\nz \u2192 Dm,mi (g)z + D\u2212m,mi (g)z,\n\n(4.11)\n\nare all non singular. It is immediate that this condition is equivalent to imposing that |Dm,mi (g)| 6=\n|D\u2212m,mi (g)|.\nWe show below that (4.11) is satisfied for some well-known examples of groups and homogeneous\nspaces. We do not know whether (4.11) is always satisfied for every compact group. We are therefore\nstating our result conditional upon (4.11) being fulfilled.\nAssumption 4.8 There exist g \u2208 G, 0 \u2264 m1 < m2 \u2264 l such that\n|Dm,mi (g)| 6= |D\u2212m,mi (g)|\nfor every 0 \u2264 m \u2264 l.\nWe have therefore proved the following.\nProposition 4.9 Let X be an homogeneous space of the compact group G. Let Hi \u2282 L2 (X , m)\nbe a subspace on which G acts irreducibly, having a dimension d > 2 and such that H i = Hi . Let\n(\u03c6k )k be an orthonormal basis of Hi such that \u03c6\u2212k = \u03c6k and consider the random field\nX\nTHi (x) =\nak \u03c6k (x)\nk\n\nwhere the r.v.'s ak , k \u2265 0 are centered, square integrable, independent and a\u2212k = ak . Then THi is\nG-invariant if and only if the r.v.'s (ak )k\u22650 are jointly Gaussian and E(|ak |2 ) = c (and therefore also\nthe field THi is Gaussian).\nPutting together Propositions 4.6 and 4.9 we obtain our main result.\nTheorem 4.10 Let X be an homogeneous space\nof the compact group G. Consider the decompo\u0001\nsition (2.1) and let (\u03c6ik )i\u2208I \u25e6 , (\u03c6ik , \u03c6ik )i\u2208I + be a basis of L2 (G) adapted to that decomposition.\nLet\nX X\nX X\n\u0001\naik \u03c6ik +\nT =\naik \u03c6ik + aik \u03c6ik\ni\u2208I \u25e6\n\nk\n\ni\u2208I +\n\n7\n\nk\n\n\fbe a random field on X , where the series above are intended to be converging in square mean. Assume\nthat T is isotropic with respect to the action of G and that the coefficients (aik )i\u2208I \u25e6 ,k\u22650 , (aik )i\u2208I +\nare independent. If moreover\na) the only one-dimensional irreducible representation appearing in (2.1) are the constants;\nb) there are no 2-dimensional subspaces H \u2282 L2 (X ), invariant under the action of G and such\nthat H = H;\nc) The random coefficient corresponding to the trivial representation vanishes.\nd) For every H \u2282 L2 (X ), irreducible under the action of G and such that H = H, Assumption\n4.8 holds.\nThen the coefficients (aik )i\u2208I \u25e6 ,k\u22650 , (aik )i\u2208I + are Gaussian and the field itself is Gaussian.\nLet us stress with the following statements the meaning of assumption a)\u2013d). The following result\ngives a condition ensuring that assumption b) of Theorem 4.10 is satisfied.\nProposition 4.11 Let U be an irreducible unitary 2-dimensional representation of G and let H1\nand H2 be the two corresponding subspaces of L2 (G) in the Peter-Weyl decomposition. Then if U\nhas values in SU (2), then H 1 = H2 6= H1 .\nProof. If we note\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\na(g) b(g)\nU (g) =\nc(g) d(g)\n\nthen one can assume that H1 is generated by the functions a and c, whereas H2 is generated by b\nand d. It suffices now to show that a is orthogonal both to a and c. But, the matrix U (g) belonging\nto SU (2), we have a(g) = d(g) \u2208 H2 .\n\u0004\nRecall that the commutator G0 , of a topological group G is the closed group that is generated by\nthe elements of the form xyx\u22121 y \u22121\nCorollary 4.12 Let G be a compact group such that its commutator G0 coincides with G himself.\nThen assumptions a) and b) of Theorem 4.10 are satisfied. In particular these assumptions are\nsatisfied if G is a semisimple Lie group.\nProof. Recall that if G0 = G, G cannot have a quotient that is an abelian group. If there was a\nunitary representation U with a determinant not identically equal to 1, then g \u2192 det(U (G)) would\nbe an homomorphism onto the torus T and therefore G would possess T as a quotient. The same\nargument proves that G cannot have a one dimensional unitary representation other than the trivial\none. One can therefore apply Proposition 4.11 and b) is satisfied.\n\u0004\nRemark 4.13 It is easy to prove that Assumption 4.8 is satisfied when X = S2 and G = SO(3).\nAs mentioned in [BM07], this can be established using explicit expressions of the representation\ncoefficients as provided e.g. in [VMK88].\nIn the same line of arguments it is also easy to check the same in the cases X = SO(3),\nG = SO(3) and X = SU (2), G = SU (2).\nRemark 4.14 As far as condition c) of Theorem 4.10, let us remark that the coefficient of the trivial\nrepresentation corresponds to the empirical mean of the field. As any random field can be decomposed into the sum of its empirical mean plus a field whose coefficient of the trivial representation\nvanishes, our result can be interpreted in terms of Gaussianity of this second component.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nAppendix\n\nProposition 5.15 Let V be a finite dimensional Hilbert space on which G acts unitarily, and let V\nbe equipped with a conjugation \u03c3(v \u2192 v\u0304) commuting with the action of G. Let H be an irreducible\nG-invariant subspace and let V = H + H.\na) If the actions of G on H and H are inequivalent, then H \u22a5 H and V = H \u2295 H.\nb) If the actions of G on H and H are equivalent, then either H = H or we can find an\nirreducible G-invariant subspace K of V such that K \u22a5 K and V = K \u2295 K.\nProof. Let P be the orthogonal projection V \u2192 H and A its restriction to H. Then, for every h \u2208 H,\nh\u2032 \u2208 H and g \u2208 G, we have\nhg(Ah), h\u2032 i = hAh, gh\u2032 i = hh, gh\u2032 i = hgh, h\u2032 i = hA(gh), h\u2032 i\nFrom this we get that G acts on A(H). The action of G on H being irreducible, we have either\nA(H) = {0} or A(H) = H. In the first case H is already orthogonal to H. Otherwise A intertwines\nthe actions on H and on H, so that these are equivalent and V = H \u2295 H \u22a5 .\nV being the sum of two copies of the representation on H, there is a unitary isomorphism\nV \u2243 H \u2297 C2 where C2 is given the standard scalar product. So we assume that V = H \u2297 C2 . G\nacts only on the first component, so that G acts irreducibly on every subspace of the form H \u2297 Z,\nZ being a one dimensional subspace of C2 .\nLet us identify the action of \u03c3 on H \u2297 C2 . Let \u03c30 be the conjugation on V defined by \u03c30 (u \u2297 v) =\nu \u2297 v\u0304 where v \u2192 v\u0304 is the standard conjugation (z1 , z2 ) \u2192 (z1 , z2 ). Then \u03c3\u03c30 is a linear operator\ncommuting with G and so is of the form 1 \u2297 L where L(C2 \u2192 C2 ) is a linear operator. Hence\n\u03c3(u \u2297 v) = \u03c3\u03c30 (u \u2297 v) = u \u2297 Lv\u0304.\nIf Z is any one dimensional subspace of C2 , H \u2297 Z is G-invariant and irreducible, and we want to\nshow that for some Z, H \u2297 Z \u22a5 H \u2297 Z \u03c3 , i.e., Z \u22a5 Z \u03c3 . Here Z \u03c3 = \u03c3(Z).\nFor any such Z, let v be a nonzero vector in it; then the condition Z \u22a5 Z \u03c3 becomes (v, Lv\u0304) = 0\nwhere (, ) is the scalar product in C2 . Since (, ) is Hermitian, B(v, w) := (v, Lw\u0304) is bilinear and we\nwant v to satisfy B(v, v) = 0. This is actually standard: indeed, replacing B by B + B T (which just\ndoubles the quadratic form) we may assume that B is symmetric.\nIf B is degenerate, there is a nonzero v such that B(v, w) = 0 for all w, hence B(v, v) = 0. If B\nis nondegenerate,\nthere is a basis v1 , v2 for C2 such that B(vi , vj ) = \u03b4ij . Then, if w = v1 + iv2 where\n\u221a\ni = \u22121, B(w, w) = 0.\n\u0004\n\nReferences\n[AK05]\n\nJ.-F.
