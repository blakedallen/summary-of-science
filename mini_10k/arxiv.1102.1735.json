We\nillustrate our approach performing explicit calculations for both interacting and non-interacting\nsystems.\n\nUnderstanding equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of thermally isolated systems has become a forefront of research due to experimental developments over\nthe past decade, particularly in cold atom systems [1],\ntrapped ions [2], and nuclear spins [3] and superconducting qubits [4]. In these systems the coupling to external\ndissipative degrees of freedom is strongly suppressed and\nirrelevant on accessible time scales. These systems provide a new and very clean playground where one can investigate fundamental questions in statistical and quantum physics. Moreover, they point to new practical applications, in particular in the context of quantum information. The experimental studies inspired intensive\ntheoretical research on a variety of topics. These include\nequilibration in isolated systems initially driven out of\nequilibrium by a sudden change in a coupling constant (a\nquench); defect (or energy) generation during slow nearly\nadiabatic processes in gapless phases or near singularities, such as quantum phase transitions (for a review see\nRefs. [5, 6]); non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions\nin the presence of 1/f noise [7]; and many more.\nIn this work, we consider the energy distribution of a\nthermally isolated system following a non-adiabatic process. Consider two setups where the energy of an isolated\nsystem is changed. In the first, the system is brought into\ncontact with a heat bath until equilibration and then disconnected from it - similar to an oven. In the second the\nenergy of the system is increased due a non-adiabatic\nchange of some external parameter(s) - much like a microwave. The two setups are illustrated schematically in\nFig. 1. Our interest is in the energy distribution of each of\nthe systems at the end of the process. For the first setup\nthe result is well-known and corresponds to the classic\n\n\u2217\n\nThese authors contributed equally to this project.\nEmail Addresses:\nbuning@tx.technion.ac.il\ndalessio@bu.edu\nkafri@physics.technion.ac.il\nasp@bu.edu\n\nheating mechanism which can be found in any book on\nthermodynamics (see e.g. Ref. [8]). If, as usual, the bath\nis large compared to the system then the energy distribution of the system becomes Gaussian, with a canonical\nwidth uniquely determined by the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation: \u03b4E 2 = T 2 Cv , where T is the temperature and\nCv is the specific heat. This relation is valid for both\nquantum and classical systems and is independent of the\ndetails of the interactions between the system and the\nbath. Now, consider a second setup where the energy\nof the system is changed due to a non-adiabatic variation of an external parameter (say, the electro-magnetic\nfield in the case of a microwave or the motion of the\npiston in Fig. 1). This type of heating also inevitably\nleads to an uncertainty in the final energy of the system.\nWhile it is known that the energy changes in the system\nobey, even beyond linear response, the recently discovered fluctuation theorems (see for example, [9\u201311]) very\nlittle is known about the resulting energy distribution\nin this case [12]. In a large macroscopic system the energy distribution is expected to be very narrow and the\nrelative energy fluctuations negligible. But in small or\nmesoscopic systems, which are of primary experimental\ninterest (see e.g. Ref. [1]), the fluctuations can be large\nand important. Fundamental questions are unanswered:\nWhich features of the energy distribution are universal\nand which features depend on details of the system and\ndriving protocol? To what extent can the width of the\ndistribution be controlled? For example, can one dynamically increase the energy of an isolated system without\nincreasing the uncertainty in the final energy? Can the\nfluctuation-dissipation relations, which determine the energy width in the oven-like setup, be extended to the\nmicrowave-like setup?\nIn this paper we begin to address such questions.\nSpecifically, we study a thermally isolated system undergoing a repeated cyclic process, whereby some external parameter \u03bb in the Hamiltonian is changed in time\nand returns to its original value at the end of each cycle,\nsee Fig. 1. We show that under generic assumptions of\n\n\f2\nfluctuation-dissipation relations between drift coefficient\n(mobility) and diffusion in open systems [13]. In particular, we find\n\u03b2B = 2A \u2212 \u2202E B = 2A + O(N \u22121 ).\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic comparison between the usual thermal\nheating (traditional oven, top) and an energy increase due to\nnot-adiabatic work (microwave oven, bottom). On the right\nof each case we present a schematic picture of the resulting\nenergy distribution in each case.\n\n(i) small work per cycle and (ii) absence of correlations\nbetween cycles (see detailed discussion in Methods) the\nvariance of the energy distribution \u03c3 2 (E) at energy E assumes a particularly simple form to leading order in 1/N ,\nwhere N is the number of degrees of freedom in the system. It depends only on the microcanonical temperature\n\u03b2(E) = \u2202E ln \u03a9(E) where \u03a9(E) is the density of states,\nand on the average energy change in a cycle at energy E,\nA(E):\n\u03c3 2 (E) = \u03c302\n\nA2 (E)\n+ 2A2 (E)\nA2 (E0 )\n\nZ\n\nE\n\nE0\n\nA2\n\ndE \u2032\n. (1)\n(E \u2032 ) \u03b2 (E \u2032 )\n\nHere E0 is the initial energy of the system and \u03c302 is the\ninitial variance. This equation is the main result of the\npaper.\nThe result (1) follows from integrating a Fokker-Planck\nequation which describs the time evolution of the energy distribution P (E, t) (see Methods and Supplementary Material for details):\n1\n\u2202t P = \u2212\u2202E (A(E)P ) + \u2202EE (B(E)P ).\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe change of the energy distribution in one cycle of the\nprotocol is obtained by integrating this equation over\nthe duration of the protocol, set for simplicity to be\nunity. Within this choice A(E), B(E) represent the average work per cycle and its variance respectively: A = hwi\nand B = hw2 ic . Here the angular brackets denote averaging over realizations of the cycle starting from a fixed\ninitial energy.\nIn general A(E) and B(E) are protocol dependent\nfunctions and are a priori independent from each other.\nHowever, since the system is thermally isolated its time\nevolution is governed by Hamilton's equations of motion\nin the classical case and the Schrodinger equation in the\nquantum case. This puts strong constraints on the relation between A(E) and B(E) similar to the Einstein\n\n(3)\n\nFor interacting systems with many degrees of freedom the\nsecond term on the RHS of this equation is a 1/N correction which can be neglected. This term can be important\nthough in mesoscopic or integrable systems. Eq. (3) was\npreviously suggested for classical systems in Ref. [22].\nThe fluctuation-dissipation relation (3) is derived within\na small work assumption (explicitly \u03b2(E)2 hw3 ic \u226a A(E),\nwhere hw3 ic is the third cumulant of the work, and\nA(E) \u226a T Cv , see Methods and Supplementary Material). As we will show below Eq. (3) holds for a very wide\nclass of classical and quantum systems starting from noninteracting particles in a time dependent cavity to fully\ninteracting spin systems. The main result of the paper\nEq. (1) is a direct consequence of this relation (see Methods).\nSeveral interesting consequences follow from Eq. (1):\n(i) When A(E) is constant the energy width depends\nonly on \u03b2(E), and not on the amplitude of the drive or\nother details of the driving protocol. (ii) When A(E) is\nnot constant, depending on the functional form of A(E)\nand \u03b2(E), the variance of the distribution can be larger\nand surprisingly, even smaller than the width of the equilibrium Gibbs distribution at the same mean energy. In\n2\nfact, \u03c3 2 (E)/\u03c3eq\n(E) can be made arbitrarily small by a\nproper choice of A(E). (iii) When A is a function of\nthe energy density u = E/N (with a possible extensive\nenergy independent prefactor like the total number of\nparticles), we have \u03c3 2 (E) \u223c O(N ), scaling as in equilibrium. For a single quench this result was noticed e.g. in\nRef. [14]. Here we show that it remains valid after many\nquenches. (iv) The dependence of \u03c3 2 on E displays two\nqualitatively distinct behaviors with increasing E, depending on whether the integral in Eq. (1) diverges or\nconverges as E \u2192 \u221e.\nTo illustrate the distinct behaviors associated with\npoint (iv) above we consider the generic case where\n\u03b2 \u221d E \u2212\u03b1 , which is the case for phonons, superfluids or\nother systems with Goldstone bosons, Fermi liquids, ideal\ngases and others. Moreover we measure time in units of\nthe number of cycles carried out (in what follows we will\nuse time and number of cycles interchangeably) and assume a simple power law behavior for A(E):\n\u2202t E = A(E) = cE s .\n\n(4)\n\nAs will become clear below the two regimes exist even\nin cases when A(E) and \u03b2(E) are not power laws. The\nvalues of \u03b1 are constrained by simple thermodynamic arguments to 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1: the lower bound is required by\npositivity of the specific heat and the upper bound assures that the entropy (S(E) \u221d E 1\u2212\u03b1 ) is an increasing\nunbounded function of the energy. To prevent the system's energy from diverging in a finite time we require\ns \u2264 1 (as follows from integrating Eq. (4)).\n\n\f3\nFor simplicity we also assume \u03c30 (E0 ) = 0 and com2\npare the width to the equilibrium canonical width \u03c3eq\n=\n1+\u03b1\n\u2212\u2202\u03b2 E \u223c E\n/\u03b1. In this case the system displays a\ntransition between two behaviors as the functional form\nof A(E) is changed. This transition is continuous and is\ncharacterized by a diverging time-scale needed to reach\nthe asymptotic regime. Specifically, depending on the\nsign of \u03b7 = 2s \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1, Eq. (1) implies: (i) When\n2\n\u03b7 < 0 the width is Gibbs-like with \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u2192 2\u03b1/|\u03b7|,\n2\n2\ni.e. the ratio \u03c3 /\u03c3eq asymptotically approaches a constant value that can be either larger or smaller than one.\nNote that smaller widths correspond to protocols with\nlarge and negative s, i.e. to protocols where A(E) is\na strongly decreasing function of energy. (ii) A second\nrun-away regime occurs when \u03b7 > 0. Here the width increases with a higher power of energy than the canonical\n2\nwidth: \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u223c E \u03b7 . The resulting distribution is significantly wider than the canonical one. Given the constraint on the value of s, this regime can only be reached\nif \u03b1 < 1, in particular this regime is unreachable for a\nclassical ideal gas. The transition between the Gibbslike and run-away regimes\n\u0010 \u0011 occurs when \u03b7 = 0 which im2\n\u223c 2\u03b1 ln EE0 . Close to this transition when\nplies \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\n|\u03b7| \u226a 1, there is a divergent time scale (or number of cycles) required to reach the asymptotic regime. This time\nscale can be obtained by combining Eq. (1) and Eq. (4),\nsee Table I. The crossover from the Gibbs-like to the runaway regime is qualitatively similar to a continuous phase\ntransition, with the diverging time scale being analogous\nto a divergent relaxation time (critical slowing down) in\nthe equilibrium case. We summarize our results, close to\nthe transition, for the above choices of \u03b2(E) and A(E)\nin Table I.\nThe qualitative difference between the two regimes can\nalso be understood\nP in terms of the entropy of the distribution: S = \u2212 n \u03c1n ln \u03c1n , where \u03c1n are the microscopic\nprobabilities to occupy different energy levels. Converting this sum into an integral over energies and expanding the resulting expression up to 1/N corrections it is\nstraightforward to check [15] that:\nS(E) \u2212 Seq (E) = ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3(E)\n\u03c3eq (E)\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3 2 (E)\n1\u2212 2\n,\n\u03c3eq (E)\n\n\u221a\nwhere Seq (E) = ln( 2\u03c0\u03c3eq (E)\u03a9(E)) is the equilibrium\ncanonical entropy. It is easy to see that the correction to\nthe equilibrium entropy is always negative except when\nthe width of the energy distribution coincides with the\ncanonical width. In the Gibbs-like regime this correction\nis a constant, while in the run-away regime it has an\nexplicit energy dependence.\nNote that under the assumptions used to derive our\nmain result, the integral in Eq. (1) can be rewritten in\nb\nterms of A(S)\nthe average entropy change per unit of time\nb\n(per-cycle), where S = ln \u03a9(E). Using A(E) = A(S)\u2202\nSE\nthe nature of the transition between the two regimes assumes an interesting physical interpretation.

This\nconclusion does not rely on any assumptions about the\nspecific functional form of \u03b2(E) and A(E).\nI.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nFirst, we consider a system of non-interacting and\nweakly interacting particles in a deforming cavity. Then\nwe analyze a single particle in a harmonic potential,\nwhich is a part of a larger system, and subject to a timedependent external force. Two additional examples of a\nclassical one-dimensional XY-model and a quantum onedimensional transverse field Ising model will be discussed\nin the Supplementary Material.\nSingle Particle in a deforming cavity: Let us first consider a very simple system - a single particle bouncing\nelastically in a cavity. When the cavity is stationary\nthe energy of the particle is conserved. If the cavity is\nchaotic there are no other conserved quantities so that\nin the long-time limit the particle relaxes to a uniform\nposition distribution and an isotropic momentum distribution. We consider a process where the system is repeatedly driven by deforming the cavity. At the end of\neach cycle the cavity comes back to its original shape\nand the system is allowed to relax in the sense described\nabove (see Fig.2). In this setup the number of degrees of\nfreedom N is given by N = 2d where d is the dimensionality of the system. In a single collision with the moving\nwall the particle's kinetic energy can either increase or\ndecrease. However, it will always increase on average\nand eventually the particles velocity will become much\ngreater than the velocity of the wall. Then the work per\ncycle automatically becomes small and the conditions for\nthe validity of the Fokker-Planck equation are satisfied.\nIf the cavity is deformed while keeping its volume fixed\nthen a very simple behavior emerges. In this case it\nhas been shown [16\u201319] that the particles velocity distribution becomes exponential irrespective of the container's shape and the deformation protocol, f (v, \u03c4 )dv \u223c\ne\u2212v/\u03c4 dv, where \u03c4 \u223c hu2 it is proportional to time (num-\n\n\f4\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nFIG. 2. An illustration of a single particle bouncing in a\ndeforming cavity of constant volume. The driving protocol\nconsists in repeatedly deforming the cavity between the two\nshapes shown.\n\nber of cycles) and to the second moment of the velocity\nof the wall. Moreover if the cavity is sufficiently chaotic\nsuccessive collisions are uncorrelated and the formalism\nholds even if the waiting time between cycles approaches\nzero (see [17] for details). In this case the fundamental equation for the energy distribution, P (E), assumes\nthe Fokker-Planck form of Eq. (2) with A(E) = c E 1/2\nand B(E) = c 4E 3/2 /(d + 1) where c contains information about the mass of the particle, the area or volume\nof the container and the velocity of the moving walls (see\nRef. [17] for details). Using \u03b2(E) = (d \u2212 2)/(2E) it is\neasy to verify that Eq. (3) is exactly satisfied with the\n1/N correction included. Therefore, in the large d-limit,\n2\nEq. (1) holds, and we find \u03c3 2 (E)/\u03c3eq\n(E) \u2192 2, consistent\nwith the exponents \u03b1 = 1 and s = 1/2. With the 1/N\ncorrection included we find:\n2 + 3/d\n\u03c3 2 (E)\n=\n.\n2\n\u03c3eq (E)\n1 + 1/d\n\n(5)\n\nThis result also follows from the exactly known single\nparticle distribution [16]. This result was also derived\nfor a single light impurity moving in a background of\nheavy atoms (Lorenz gas). In this case a full microscopic\ndescription based on a Lorentz-Boltzmann equation is\npossible [20].\nWeakly-interacting particles: Extending the above example, consider n weakly interacting particles in a deforming cavity so that N = 2nd. We assume that during\neach cycle the particles can be treated as non-interacting,\nwhile between cycles the system rethermalizes at a fixed\ntotal energy, so that the velocity distribution of the particles becomes Maxwell-Boltzmann rather than exponential. A calculation similar to that of [16, 17] shows that\nA(E) and B(E) have the same functional form as in the\nnon-interacting case but with different prefactors. Moreover both A(E) and B(E) become extensive and the constraint, Eq. (3), is satisfied with the 1/N correction becoming negligible. Then Eq. (1) gives the asymptotic\n2\nresult \u03c3 2 (E)/\u03c3eq\n(E) \u2192 2, consistent with the exponents\n\u03b1 = 1 and s = 1/2. This result is identical to the single particle result in the large N limit, despite the very\ndifferent single particle velocity distributions.\nIn either noninteracting or interacting setups the two\nfunctions, A(E), B(E), can be experimentally obtained\n\nby measuring the first two cumulants of the work distribution in one cycle: hwi = A(E) and hw2 ic = B(E).\nAlternatively one can measure the average energy and its\nvariance versus time and determine A(E) and B(E) as\nthe slopes of these two functions respectively.\nSingle particle in a time-dependent potential: Next we\nconsider a classical particle in a harmonic trap, which is\npart of a larger system, e.g. a set of N identical particles,\nwhose details define \u03a9(E) and hence \u03b2(E). We assume\nthat the coupling to the rest of the system is weak and\nunimportant within the duration of a cycle, much like\nin the weakly-interacting particle gas example above. In\ncontrast with the previous example, this setup illustrates\ndriving a system with a local perturbation (which can,\nhowever, be applied independently to many different particles). The particle's energy \u03b5 between cycles is given by\n\u03b5=\n\n1 2 1\nkx + mv 2 .\n2\n2\n\nFor simplicity we work in one dimension. For large N\nthe probability distribution for (x, v) before the drive is\n\u03c1(x, v) \u221d exp (\u2212\u03b2(E)\u03b5). We consider a driving process\nwhich consists of an impulse of magnitude F (x) \u2206t with\n\u2206t short enough so that the particle's position does not\nchange appreciably during the drive. This assumption\nalso guaranties that the coupling to the rest of the system\nis unimportant during a cycle. Under this impulse the\nvelocity changes according to v \u2192 v + F (x) \u2206t. A, B are\nreadily calculated and read\nE\nD\n2\nA = (F (x)) \u2206t2 ,\nE\n2D\n2\nB=\n(F (x)) \u2206t2 ,\n\u03b2\nverifying fluctuation-dissipation relations (3).\n\u03b2 (E) \u221d E \u2212\u03b1 and F (x) \u221d xr we find\n\nTaking\n\nA \u221d x2r \u221d \u01ebr \u221d E \u03b1r .\nUsing our previous convention, A \u221d E s , we see that s =\n\u03b1r. Different values of \u03b7 = 2\u03b1r \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 can be obtained\nusing different impulse forces and systems. For example,\nfor a system with \u03b1 = 1/2, such as a Fermi liquid or a\none-dimensional harmonic system, with r = 1 we obtain\n2\n\u03b7 = \u22121/2 leading to the Gibbs-like regime with \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n=\n2. When r = 3/2 we are at the critical regime \u03b7 = 0.\nFinally for r = 2 we obtain \u03b7 = 1/2 leading to the run2\naway regime where \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u223c E 1/2 .\nII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe main result of our paper is based on a fluctuationdissipation relation connecting drift and diffusion of the\nenergy in a driven system (Eq. (3)). This relation is very\nclosely connected to the recently discovered fluctuation\ntheorems. In fact, in the supplementary material we give\na rigorous derivation of Eq. (3) using the quantum version\n\n\f5\nof fluctuation theorems, which we extend to our setup of\nrepeated cyclic processes. In the original formulation the\nJarzynski relation states that if a system starts from a\nGibbs distribution the change in energy of the system,\nw, for cyclic processes obeys the equality he\u2212\u03b2w i = 1.\nHere the angular brackets denote an average over both\ndifferent realizations of the process and different initial\nconditions. As emphasized in Ref. [12] these relations\nholds very little information about the first few moments\nof the distribution of w, unless w is small. Only when\nit is small, a cumulant expansion of the Jarzynski relation up to the second order in w recovers the fluctuationdissipation relation (3) without the 1/N correction (see\nSupplementary Material for details). When the energy\nchanges are large its moments are governed by details of\nthe physical process which have to be accounted for (see\n[12]). In this paper we (i) importantly, overcome the restriction of small energy changes by considering a large\nchange which is a results of many small changes (leading\nto Eq. (1)) and (ii) show that relation (3) is independent\nof the exact form of the initial distribution.\nWe believe that some of the assumptions of the work\ncan be further relaxed. In particular, it can be shown\nthat relation (3) is valid for generic (non-cyclic) quasistatic process where the system is approximately in a\nsteady state at each moment of time. In this case by A is\nrelated to the non-adiabatic part of the work w. Likewise\nit is plausible that the assumptions of complete relaxation to a steady state between cycles are not necessary,\nat least for ergodic systems. Physically these assumptions amount to a loss of correlations between different\ncycles which is inevitable in ergodic systems. The assumption of unitary dynamics can be also relaxed. For\nexample, we can allow measurements of the energy during the protocol, which in quantum systems project the\nsystem to one of the energy eigenstates. Such measurements do not invalidate the derivation given in Appendix\nI. These points will be addressed in a future study.\nThe predictions of this paper can be experimentally\ntested in cold atom systems or in driven nuclear spins.\nFor example, a trapping potential can be modulated to\nperform non-adiabatic work on the system. The resulting energy distribution can then be probed using time of\nflight experiments. Likewise one can measure energy fluctuations due to a 1/f noise in systems of neutral atoms\nnear atom chips or in trapped ions in a setup similar to\nthat discussed in Ref. [7]. If there is no external cooling\nor dissipation in the system after its initial preparation\n(as is often the case) then the energy fluctuations induced\nby the noise should also agree with our predictions.\nFinally, we comment that energy fluctuations can be\nmeasured indirectly through averages or fluctuations of\nother observables, like the magnetization or correlation\nfunctions. In particular, it is easy to check that the expectation value of every observable O and its variance,\nup to 1/N 2 corrections, are given by\nhOi \u2248 Omc +\n\n2\n\u03c3E\n\u2202 2 Omc\n2\n2\n, \u03b4O2 \u2248 \u03b4Omc\n+ (\u2202E Omc )2 \u03c3E\n2 \u2202E 2\n\nwhere Omc is the microcanonical average of O at fixed\n2\nenergy E and \u03b4Omc\nis the variance of O in the microcanonical ensemble. Thus Eq. (1) will have implications\nto fluctuations of a wide class of observables in mesoscopic thermally isolated driven systems.\nThe authors would like to thank G. Ortiz for the comment related to a cumulant expansion of the Jarzynski equality which plays an important role in the proof.\nThe authors also acknowledge the support of the NSF\nDMR-0907039 (A.P.), AFOSR FA9550-10-1-0110 (L.D.\nand A.P.), Sloan Foundation (A.P.), Y.K. thanks the\nBoston University visitors program for its hospitality.\n\nIII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe now outline a particularly simple derivation of\nEqs. (1) and (3). A more rigorous derivation based on\nfluctuation theorems and the unitarity of the evolution is\ngiven in the Supplementary Material. Our process consists of many repeated cycles during which the control\nparameter \u03bb(t) is varied in time, returning to its initial\nvalue at the end of each cycle. We assume that between\nthe cycles the system reaches a steady state (or a diagonal\nensemble [21] in the quantum language) so that its state\nis fully characterized by its energy distribution. In ergodic systems this requirement can be satisfied by waiting\nbetween cycles a time which is longer than the relaxation\ntime of the system. In non ergodic (integrable) systems\nthis can be achieved by having a long fluctuating time between cycles. This effectively leads to an additional time\naveraging which is equivalent to the assumption of starting from a diagonal ensemble. (For more details about\nrelaxation to asymptotic states in integrable systems see\nRef. [5] and refs. therein). To make this discussion more\nconcrete consider, for example, a compression and expansion of the piston in Fig. 1 according to an arbitrary\nprotocol. The gas is allowed to relax between the cycles\n(when the piston is stationary) at a fixed energy. For a\nweakly interacting ergodic gas such a relaxation implies\nthat the momentum distribution of individual particles\nassumes a Maxwell-Boltzmann form together with a randomization of the coordinate distribution. For a noninteracting gas in a chaotic cavity the relaxation implies\nconservation of the individual energies of each particle\nand a randomization of the coordinates and directions of\ntheir motion. And finally for noninteracting particles in\na regular non-chaotic cavity the relaxation implies a randomization of the coordinates within individual periodic\ntrajectories. Therefore, in the beginning of each cycle\nthere are no correlations between positions and velocities of particles within the available phase space.\nIf we make an additional assumption about ergodicity\nthen the system between the cycles is fully described by\nthe total energy. As we will see later, when we discuss\nspecific examples, this assumption is not always necessary. Assuming that during each cycle a small amount\nof work is carried out on the system the energy distribu-\n\n\f6\ntion P (E, t) can be described by the Fokker-Planck equation (2) [8]. The easiest way to derive the fluctuationdissipation relation (3) is to note that under very general conditions the only attractor of Hamiltonian dynamics is a flat probability distribution for the occupation\nof different microstates (see Ref. [22] for the classical\ncase and Ref. [23] for the quantum case), which is the\nmaximum entropy state. Therefore the energy distribution which is proportional to the many-particle density\nof states Ps (E) = C\u03a9(E) should be stationary under\nthe Fokker-Planck equation, implying that the current\nJs = \u2212A(E)Ps (E) + 21 \u2202E (B(E)Ps (E)) is a constant,\nwhich vanishes since Ps (E) = 0 for E below the groundstate energy. Finally we use \u03b2(E) = \u2202E ln \u03a9(E) to obtain\nEq. (3). For a rigorous derivation of this result and the\nrange of its applicability see Supplemetary Material.\n\nO(N \u22121 ) we find:\n\u2202E A(hEi) 2\n\u2202\u03c3 2\n= 2\u03b2 \u22121 (hEi) + 2\n\u03c3 (hEi).\n\u2202hEi\nA(hEi)\n\n(7)\n\nIf the energy distribution P (E) is narrow, as in the case of\nlarge systems, we can evaluate the averages above using\na saddle-point approximation and Eq. (3). Then to order\n\nIntegrating this equation immediately yields Eq. (1).\nLet us now comment on the regime of validity of\nEq. (1). The derivation is based on the Fokker-Plank\nequation, Eq. (2), the generalized fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation, Eq. (3), and the saddle-point expansion in\nEq. (7). The validity of the Fokker-Planck equation\nrelies on the assumption that the work distribution is\nnarrow and the average work for cycle is small. More\nspecifically this equation is derived from a cumulant expansion of the Crook's relation up to second order in\nthe work (see Sec. I in Supplementary Material for details). Let us here only mention two necessary conditions justifying the Fokker-Planck equation and the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation Eq. (3): (i) The third\n(and higher order) cumulant of work per cycle are small\n\u03b2 2 (E)hw3 ic \u226a hwi = A(E). (ii) The average work per\ncycle is smaller than the product of temperature and the\nspecific heat Cv : \u03b2(E)hwi = \u03b2(E)A(E) \u226a Cv . As explained in the Supplementary Material (sec. I), if this\ncondition is not satisfied there are corrections of order\n\u03b2A2 (E)/Cv to Eq. (3). Finally the saddle-point approximation in Eq. (7) is justified if the energy fluctuations in\nthe system are small. This is the case in large or mesoscopic extensive systems.\nWe also note that our derivation implicitly relies on\nthe assumption of ergodicity within the system. In particular, we are assuming that P (E) is a differentiable\nfunction of energy. In integrable systems this is not necessarily the case [15]. Then the validity of our results\nshould be checked on a case by case basis. For example, as we showed above, Eq. (3) and the corresponding\nFokker-Planck equation (2) describe the dynamics of a\nsingle particle in a cavity. In this case, however, the second term in the RHS of Eq. (3) is important and modifies the width of the distribution even if we consider\nan ensemble of many noninteracting (and therefore nonergodic) particles.\n\n[1] I. Bloch, J. Dalibard, W.

(4) FROM THE\nQUANTUM CROOK'S EQUALITY\n\nHere we will sketch the derivation of Eq. (3) relying\nonly on the unitarity of the dynamics in the quantum\ncase and the incompressibility of Hamiltonian dynamics\n(i.e. Liouville's theorem) in classical case. Our proof will\nbe based on the Crooks theorem. As it was noted in previously (see for example [1]), for a closed system obeying\nclassical Hamiltonian dynamics, the Crooks theorem relies on the incompressibility of trajectories in phase space\n(Liouville's theorem) and microscopic time reversibility.\nHere we extend this proof to isolated quantum Hamiltonian systems with a discrete spectrum. Our proof of the\nquantum Crook's relation bears some similarities with\nthat discussed in Ref. [2], and is presented here for completeness. This will emphasize some important properties of the transition matrix, highlight that the Crook's\nrelation does not rely on assumptions related to energy\nmeasurements, e.g. at intermediate steps, and extend\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation (3) to non-canonical\ndistributions.\nLet us assume that a system prepared in a stationary state, described by a diagonal density matrix in the\nenergy basis, undergoes some process described by a unitary operator U (t). According to standard quantum mechanics the density matrix evolves in time according to\n\u03c1(t) = U (t)\u03c1(0)U \u2020 (t). This means that the diagonal elements of the time evolved density matrix in the new\nenergy basis are given by\nX\nX\n\u2020\n\u03c1nn (t) =\nUnm \u03c1mm (0)Umn\n=\nTm\u2192n \u03c1mm (0) (8)\nm\n\nm\n\nwhere we used the fact that the initial density matrix is diagonal and introduced the transition probabilities Tm\u2192n = |Umn |2 (see also Ref. [3]). P\nThe matrix\nT\nis\ndoubly\nstochastic\nmeaning\nthat\nn Tm\u2192n =\nPm\u2192n\nT\n=\n1.\nWhile\nthe\nfirst\nequality\nis\nsimply\nthe\nm m\u2192n\nconservation of probability the second is a direct consequence of unitarity. It is easy to see that this equality is\nviolated if there are losses in the system due to e.g. spontaneous emission. Now let us imagine a time-reversed\nprotocol described by the inverse evolution operator U \u22121 .\nFrom the definition of the transition probabilities it is\nclear that\nT\u0303n\u2192m = Tm\u2192n ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere T\u0303n\u2192m refers to the reverse process. Let us\ncomment that the transition probabilities also satisfy\ndetailed-balance, Tn\u2192m = Tm\u2192n , in the two following\nsituations: (i) if the Hamiltonian of the system is timereversal invariant at each moment of time and the protocol is time symmetric so that U (t) = U (T \u2212 t), where\nT is the period of the cycle. (ii) If the transition probabilities during one cycle are small and can be computed\n\nwithin first order in an adiabatic perturbation theory [3],\ni.e. a perturbation theory in a basis evolving with the\nHamiltonian (this theory also includes ordinary perturbation theory as a particular limit of small amplitude\nperturbations). Let us stress that detailed-balance only\nplays the role in our proof for deriving the subleading\n\u2202E B correction in the relation (3).\nTo proceed we use the energy distribution:\nX\nP (E) =\n\u03c1nn \u03b4(E \u2212 En )\n(10)\nn\n\nand relate transition probabilities between energy levels\nto the transition probabilities between energy shells:\nTE\u2192E \u2032 =\n\n1 X\n\u03b4(E \u2212 En )\u03b4(E \u2032 \u2212 Em )Tn\u2192m , (11)\n\u03a9(E) n,m\n\nP\nwhere \u03a9(E) = n \u03b4(E \u2212En ) is the many-body density of\nstates. RThe factor 1/\u03a9(E) ensures conservation of probability: dE \u2032 TE\u2192E \u2032 = 1. The master equation (8) is then\ngiven by\nZ\n(12)\nP (E \u2032 ) = dE TE\u2192E \u2032 P0 (E)\nWe now multiply both sides of Eq. (9) by \u03b4(E \u2212\nEn )\u03b4(E \u2032 \u2212 Em ) and sum over n, m to obtain\n\u03a9(E)TE\u2192E \u2032 = \u03a9(E \u2032 )T\u0303E \u2032 \u2192E\nDenoting E \u2032 = E + w and using the fact that \u03a9(E) =\nexp[S(E)] we can rewrite the equation above as\nTE\u2192E+w e\u2212S(E+w)+S(E) = T\u0303E+w\u2192E ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is known as the Crooks relation [4].\nTo prove relation (3) we use Eq. (13), and expand the\nentropy and the transition probability TE\u2192E+w in w:\nS (E + w) \u2212 S (E) \u2248 \u03b2w \u2212\n\n1\nw2\n2\n2\u03c3eq\n\n(14)\n\nT\u0303E+w\u2192E = T\u0303E\u2192E\u2212w + w\u2202E T\u0303E\u2192E\u2212w ,\nas in the main text we assume a cyclic process.\nNote that when hwi is held constant and the system\nsize is increased, the second terms on the RHS of each\nof the above equations scale as 1/N . To leading order in\n1/N , integrating Eq. (13) over dw we obtain the Jarzynski like relation e\u2212\u03b2w = 1, where the brackets represent\nan average over realizations of the process. Note that we\ndid not make any assumption about an initial Gibbs distribution. Taking the logarithm of this Jarzynski relation\nand performing a cumulant expansion we find\n2hwi \u2248 \u03b2hw2 ic\n\n(15)\n\nfrom which Eq. (3) is obtained by using\nA = hwi,\n\nB = hw2 i \u2212 hwi2 \u2261 hw2 ic .\n\n(16)\n\n\f9\nThe condition for the validity of this expansion is that\nthe third cumulant of the work is small:\n\u03b2 2 hw3 ic \u226a hwi.\n\n(17)\n\nWhen the additional assumption of the detailedbalance holds we can use T = T\u0303 in Eq. (13). We point\nagain that detailed-balance is valid for arbitrary symmetric protocols as well as for non-symmetric protocols,\nprovided that the transition probabilities can be computed within first order of adiabatic perturbation theory. \u2020 Since the work per cycle is assumed to be small, it\nis expected that the transition probabilities are also small\nand can be computed perturbatively. So the assumption\nof T = T\u0303 between energy shells is likely to be generic.\nIn particular, one can check that it is asymptotically satisfied at high energies for the piston example discussed\nin the main text even for asymmetric protocols. In this\ncase, integrating Eq. (13) using the expansions (14) we\nobtain\n\u001c\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001d\nw2\nexp \u2212\u03b2w + 2\n\u2248 1 \u2212 \u2202E hwi\n(18)\n2\u03c3eq\nTaking the logarithm of both sides and performing the\ncumulant expansion of the exponent up to the order w2\nwe find\n\u2212 \u03b2hwi +\n\nhw2 i \u03b2 2\n+\nh\u03b4w2 i \u2248 \u2212\u2202E hwi.\n2\n2\u03c3eq\n2\n\n(19)\n\nIt is easy to check that up to order 1/N the equations above imply Eq. (3): 2A = \u03b2B + \u2202E B as long as\n2\nhwi2 /\u03c3eq\nis negligible compared to \u03b2hwi. Noting that\n2\nhw i = hw2 ic + hwi2 = B + A2 this gives us a necessary\ncondition of validity of relation (3):\nA = hwi \u226a T Cv .\n\n(20)\n\nNamely, the work per unit cycle should be small compared to the temperature multiplied by the specific heat.\nWe note that even though we derived Eq. (3) to the order\nof 1/N , it is actually correct to all orders in 1/N . This\nrelation is valid as long as the conditions (17) and (20)\nare satisfied.\nFinally let us discuss extension of the fluctuationdissipation relation (3) to arbitrary distributions. In order to do this we need to weight Eq. (3) with an energy\ndistribution P (E) and integrate over energies. Then it\nis easy to check that in the Gaussian approximation we\nfind\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2\n\u03c32\n1\nhwi \u2248 hw2 ic +\n1 \u2212 2 \u2202E hw2 ic .\n(21)\n2\n2\n\u03c3eq\n\n\u2020\n\nIn general situations, which can involve Berry phases, this statement is correct only in the appropriate adiabatic (co-moving)\nbasis.\n\nThis relation is clearly a generalization of Eq. (3). In\nparticular, it reduces to Eq. (3) for the microcanonical\ndistribution with \u03c3 2 = 0 and it reduces to the conventional result obtained from the cumulant expansion of\nthe Jarzynski relation hwi \u2248 \u03b2/2hw2 ic for the canonical\ndistribution \u03c3 = \u03c3eq .\nII.\n\nADDITIONAL EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section we will provide two additional examples illustrating validity of our results to a classical and\nquantum interacting one-dimensional spin chains.\n\nA.\n\nAn XY model in one dimension\n\nFirst we consider an XY-model on a one-dimensional\nlattice of size N . On each lattice site there is a single degree of freedom, which may be viewed as a twodimensional unit vector. The interaction energy between neighboring sites i, j is Hi,j = 1 \u2212 cos (\u03b8i,j ), where\n\u03b8i,j = \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j is the difference between the angles at\nsites i and j. The total Hamiltonian is given by summing P\nover all nearest neighbors the interaction terms\nH = hi,ji Hi,j . To drive the system, we assume that the\nangle at a specific site \u03b8i is changed by a small amount\n\u03b4\u03b8, which is a fluctuating variable with zero mean, and\nother sites are unaffected. Such a protocol, for example, describes an interaction of the system with an external fluctuating local magnetic field. The problem can\nbe solved exactly in one-dimension. To do this, note\nthat the change in energy of the system depends only on\nthe two differences \u03b8i\u22121,i and \u03b8i,i+1 before the drive. The\nprobability distribution of \u03b8i,i+1 to order O(1/N ) is given\nby\n\u03c1(\u03b8i,i+1 ) \u221d exp[\u03b2(E) cos(\u03b8i,i+1 )].\n\n(22)\n\nUsing this expression, it is straightforward to calculate the values of the average work and its fluctuations\nA(E) = hwi , B(E) = w2 c to order \u03b4\u03b82 :\nA = \u03b4\u03b82\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2A\nE\n, B=\n.\n1\u2212\nN\n\u03b2\n\n(23)\n\nHere to relate E and \u03b2 we used the expression for the\nenergy [9] E/N = 1 \u2212 [I1 (\u03b2) /I0 (\u03b2)], where In denotes a\nmodified Bessel function of the first kind of order n.\nSubstituting relations (23) into Eq. (1) and numeri2\ncally integrating we obtain \u03c3 2 (E)/\u03c3eq\n(E) as a function\nof \u03b2(E). The results are shown in Fig. 3. Note that there\nare two regimes. In the low energy regime A is to lowest\norder constant, s = 0, and \u03b1 = 1, which gives \u03b7 = \u22122,\n2\nand \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u2243 1, see Table I. The next order correction\nfor small E/N can be obtained using Eq. (23) and gives:\n2\n\u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u2243 1 \u2212 E/N . Then at high energies, close to infi2\nnite temperature, E/N = 1 and again \u03c3 2 /\u03c3eq\n\u2192 1.

The ratio \u03c3 2 (E)/\u03c3eq\n(E) as a function of E/N for a\none-dimensional XY-model. The initial conditions are E0 = 0\nand \u03c302 = 0.\n\nis due to the finite phase-space available to this system,\nwhich allows the system to reach a stationary distribution\nwith \u03b2 = 0 at a finite total energy density (E/N = 1).\nB.\n\nThe transverse-field Ising model in one\ndimension\n\nFinally we consider a quantum transverse-field Ising\nmodel in one dimension described by the Hamiltonian:\nX\nz\n] + H \u2032,\n(24)\n[g\u03c3jx + \u03c3jz \u03c3j+1\nH=\u2212\nj\n\nwhere H \u2032 is a weak perturbation breaks integrability of\nthe system but does not affect the dynamics during the\ndriving protocol. For example, this perturbation can be a\nweak second nearest-neighbor spin-spin interaction. The\nassumption of smallness of H \u2032 is only important to make\nexplicit analytic calculations. For simplicity we will consider the domain of non-negative values of the transverse\nfield g. This system undergoes a quantum phase transition at g = 1 [5]. Using a Jordan-Wigner transformation the Hamiltonian assumes a quadratic form in the\nfermionic operators and can be fully diagonalized performing a Bogoliubov rotation in momentum space [5].\nThe final Hamiltonian reads:\nX g \u2020\n1\nH=\n\u01ebk (\u03b3k \u03b3k \u2212 ),\n(25)\n2\nk\n\nwhere\n\u01ebgk = 2\n\u03b3k\u2020 ,\n\np\np\n1 + g 2 \u2212 2g cos(k) \u2248 2 (1 \u2212 g)2 + k 2\n\nand\n\u03b3k are quasi-particle creation and annihilation\noperators. Here in order to simplify analytic expressions\nwe linearized the spectrum by taking g \u2212 1 \u226a 1 and the\nrelevant momenta are much smaller than the ultra-violet\ncutoff given by the lattice: |k| \u226a \u03c0. The ground state\nof this Hamiltonian, which is annihilated by all quasiparticle operators \u03b3k , is factorized into momentum sectors. The excited states can be obtained by applying\n\nvarious combination of operators \u03b3k\u2020 to the ground state.\nIf the external time-dependent perturbation is spatially\nuniform then due to momentum conservation only the\nexcited states corresponding to pairs of excited quasiparticles with opposite momenta obtained by applying\n\u2020\n\u03b3k\u2020 \u03b3\u2212k\nto the ground state participate in the dynamics.\nMoreover excitations to different momentum states are\nindependent and the problem effectively splits into a collection of two levels-systems. Let us emphasize that this\nsystem does not become classical even in the infinite temperature limit. In disordered systems this feature was explored e.g. in the context of the many-body localization\nin Ref. [6].\nWe now perturb the system by changing the amplitude of the transverse-field g(t) = g1 + \u03b4 t(1 \u2212 t/\u03c4 ),\nt \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ] from its initial value, g1 , to an intermediate\nvalue, g2 = g1 + \u03b4\u03c4 /4 and then back to g1 . Here the parameter \u03b4 sets the velocity of the quench and \u03b4\u03c4 /4 sets its\namplitude. As a result of this process the occupation of\nthe energy levels will change. Because different momentum modes are effectively independent from each other\nwe will consider each two-level system separately. The\npresence of the weak integrability breaking perturbation\nensures a Fermi-Dirac redistribution of the energy among\ndifferent modes between different cycles. It is similar to\nthe effect of a weak interaction between particles leading to a Maxwell-Boltzmann single-particle distribution\nin the piston example or an assumption of weak coupling to the rest of the system in the single oscillator\nexample discussed in the main text. The ergodicity of\nsmall weakly nonintegrable one-dimensional systems was\nrecently tested numerically to a very good accuracy for\nhard-core bosons and fermions, which are closely related\nto the transverse field Ising model (see e.g. Ref. [7]).\nUnder these assumptions each cycle starts from the\nFermi-Dirac distribution in each momentum mode. To\navoid extra complications related to the singularities of\nthe transition probabilities at the critical point we will\nadditionally assume that dynamics occurs only in one\nphase, say g > 1 (at finite temperatures we are interested in, this assumption can be further relaxed). For\nslow quenches, if the rate \u03b4 is small: \u03b4 \u226a (g1 \u2212 1)2 , such\nthat the adiabaticity condition \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb2k is satisfied for all\nmodes, the dynamics can be solved analytically. In particular, in Ref. [8] it was shown, that under these conditions the transition probability between the ground and\nexcited states is approximately equal to (see Eqs. (20)\nand (87) in Ref. [8])\npk \u2248\n\n1\n\u03b42 k2\n2\u03b4 2 k 2\n= g1 6 .\n2\n2\n3\n32 (k + (g1 \u2212 1) )\n(\u01ebk )\n\n(26)\n\nNote that there is an additional contribution to Eq. (26)\nwhich is rapidly oscillating at a frequency \u03c9 \u223c (g2 \u2212 g1 )\u03c4\n(see Eq. (20) in Ref. [8]) and averages to zero either because of adding contributions from different momentum\nmodes or because of slight fluctuations of the quench time\n\u03c4 from cycle to cycle. Actually the addition of the oscillating term to Eq. (26) will at most double the transition\n\n\f11\nprobability. As we will see below our results are not affected by the precise form of pk as long as pk is small,\nwhich is controlled by \u03b4 and decays sufficiently fast with\nmomentum k so that the work distribution remains sufficiently narrow.\nWith these transition rates, the master equation for the\noccupation probabilities of different momentum states\nbecomes particularly simple:\n!\n!\n!\n\u03c1kGr\n1 \u2212 pk\npk\n\u03c1 \u0303k kGr\n=\n,\npk\n1 \u2212 pk\n\u03c1kEx\n\u03c1 \u0303k kEx\nwhere \u03c1kEx and \u03c1\u0303kEx refer to the probabilities of having\na pair of fermions with momenta k and \u2212k before and\nafter the quench respectively and likewise, \u03c1kGr and \u03c1\u0303kGr\nare the probabilities to have no fermions in the k and \u2212k\nmomentum mode. Due to rethermalization of the system\nbetween driving protocols we have\n\u03c1kGr =\n\nexp[\u2212\u03b2\u01ebgk1 ]\nexp[\u03b2\u01ebgk1 ]\nk\ng1 , \u03c1Ex =\n2 cosh[\u03b2\u01ebk ]\n2 cosh[\u03b2\u01ebgk1 ]\n\nhwk2 i = (2\u01ebgk1 )2 pk\n\n(28)\n\nFrom this equation we deduce the relation (3) between\nAk = hwk i and Bk = hwk2 ic : 2Ak \u2248 \u03b2Bk is satisfied provided that pk \u226a 1, which is the case for sufficiently slow\nquenches, and \u03b2\u01ebgk1 \u226a 1 which means that the temperature is big compared to the initial energy of the fermions.\nThe latter condition is always satisfied if the temperature is large compared to the gap in the system and that\nthe relevant excited modes correspond to small momenta,\nwhich is the case for sufficiently slow quenches. If these\nconditions are fulfilled then Eq.

The validity of the Einstein-like relation for the\ntransverse-field Ising model as a function of the initial temperature. The transition probability are calculated as in Eq. (26)\nwith \u03b4 = 0.05 and g1 = 1.1. In the inset we show the initial\noccupancy of energy level at T = 2.0.\n\n(27)\n\nActually these expressions are somewhat modified due to\npresence of the inert modes with one fermion in either k\nor \u2212k mode, but this modification does not affect our\nconclusions since the inert modes do not participate in\ntransitions only effectively reducing the number of active\nmodes by a factor of two in the regime of interest. From\nthe master equation and the probabilities of occupying\ninitial states above we find the average work and its second moment for individual momentum modes:\nhwk i = 2\u01ebgk1 pk tanh(\u03b2\u01ebgk1 )\n\n2\n\nk>0\n\nIn Fig. 4 we show the calculated values of 2A and \u03b2B\nfor different initial temperatures for the protocol with\ng1 = 1.1 and \u03b4 = 0.05 (the time \u03c4 drops out from the\nanswer if \u03b4\u03c4 2 \u226b g1 ). As the temperature increases the\nwork per cycle, A, decreases due to fermion anti-bunching\nand the relation (3) is satisfied to a very good accuracy\nas soon as temperature becomes much bigger than the\ngap.\n\nLet us make now a number of remarks on validity of\nour results and the importance of the protocol in quantum systems. The general analysis and derivation of the\nFokker-Planck equation in the main paper as well as the\nrelation (3) in Sec. I of this Supplementary Material (see\nEq.(15)) are based on a quantum formalism. Therefore\nas soon as the conditions \u03b2hwi \u226a Cv and \u03b2 2 hw3 i \u226a hwi\nare satisfied Eq. (3) should work. And indeed we illustrated this here for a particular example of a transverse\nfield Ising model. Instead of this model we could get e.g.\nfermions with two-body interactions and would come to\nsimilar conclusions. The smallness of work can be controlled by doing sufficiently slow quenches or by quenches\nof small amplitude similar to the classical case. There is\nan important subtlety related to the second condition of\nthe smallness of the third and higher cumulants of work\nwhich distinguishes quantum and classical systems. In\nparticular, in classical situations it is impossible to give\na large energy to a system during a cycle unless the external parameter changes suddenly. E.g. in a deforming cavity example during each collision with a wall the\nparticle can gain at most velocity 2V , where V is the\nvelocity of the wall. This means that in classical situations the work distribution is typically bounded and the\nsmallness of average work usually implies smallness of\nits cumulants. In quantum systems the situation is very\ndifferent. Namely in any protocol it is possible to give\nthe system arbitrarily large energy. For smooth protocols, where the external parameter changes analytically\nin time the transition probability to high energy states\ndecreases exponentially like in the conventional LandauZener problem and such transitions do not affect cumulants of work. However, for non-analytic protocols where\ne.g. amplitude, velocity (like in our case) or acceleration experience a discontinuity the transition probability\nto high energy states decreases only algebraically with\nenergy like in Eq. (26) (see Ref. [8] for more details).\n\n\f12\nThis means that high enough cumulants of work necessarily diverge. Of course real experimental protocols are\nalways smooth and these divergencies are cutoff, however the degree of smoothness introduces a new quantum\nscale into the dynamics. Thus the work distribution can\nbe effectively wide or narrow in the sense of satisfying\nthe condition \u03b2 2 hw3 i \u226a hwi depending on the ratio of\nthis new energy scale and temperature.\n\n2\n2A\n\u03b2B\n1.5\n\n1\nk\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c1GS\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1EX\n\nk\n\n0.4\n-3\nx10 1\n\n0.2\n0\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-2\n\n\u03b5k\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\nSince this discussion is not directly related to this paper we postpone it until future work. Here we only explicitly analyze another protocol where the coupling changes\nquadratically in time: g(t) = g1 + (\u03b5/2) t2 (1 \u2212 t/\u03c4 )2 . In\nthis case in the slow limit \u03b5 . (g1 \u22121)3 instead of Eq. (26)\nwe get (see Ref. [8] for details):\n\npk \u2248\n\n1 \u03b52 k 2\n.\n2 (\u01ebgk1 )8\n\n(29)\n\nAs we see indeed the transitions to the higher energy\nstates are suppressed even more than for the linear protocol so that more cumulants of work now converge at\nsmall energies. As a result the relation (3) is satisfied\neven at smaller temperatures, see Fig. 5. In Fig. 5 we\nshow the values of 2A and \u03b2B obtained using Eq. (29)\nwith g1 = 1.1 and \u01eb = 0.024 (the time \u03c4 drops out from\nthe answer if \u03b5\u03c4 4 \u226b g1 ). With this choice of the parameters the peak value of pk in the two protocols (linear, Eq. (26), and quadratic, Eq. (29)) are equal. The\nEinstein-relation, 2A = \u03b2B, is satisfied when the relative\nerror (B/T \u2212 2A)/2A becomes less than 5%. With this\ndefinition the Einstein-relation is satisfied at T > 2 for\nthe linear and T > 0.8 for the quadratic protocol.\n\n[1] P. Pradhan, Y. Kafri, and D.
