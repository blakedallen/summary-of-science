A\nshort discussion of situations dominated by low frequency noise is given.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the study of macroscopic quantum mechanics and quantum logic devices in\nparticular, the question of decoherence and its effects remains an important, if\nnot the most important, issue. Inevitable disturbances from the environment of\nthe quantum device, and correlations established with variables of the environ-\n\n1\n\n\fment, will limit the length of time for which the system under study acts as an\nisolated quantum system.\nIn previous work we studied, by means of numerical simulation, how decoherence affects and interacts with the behavior of some quantum logic devices\n[1]. The decoherence was modeled by a simple random noise signal presumed\nto act on a certain component of the system \u2013 in the SQUID corresponding to\nflux noise. In the present work we wish to consider more generally the connection between decoherence, the type of random noise signal, and the parts of the\nsystem upon which it acts. We reach a number of interesting conclusions on the\neffects of these factors.\nA further interest of such studies is its connection with the \"quantum measurement problem\", and we are able to illustrate quantitatively phenomena like\nthe \"Collapse of the Wavefunction\" and the \"Watched Pot Effect\" through the\nsimulations.\n\n2\n\nHamiltonian\n\nWe shall examine the hamiltonian\nH=\n\n\u22121 \u2202 2\n+ V0 { 12 [(x \u2212 xext )2 ] + \u03b2 cosx} + HN (t) ,\n2\u03bc \u2202x2\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is suitable for representing a \"qubit\" and through manipulations on xext ,\nthe quantum logic operations NOT and CNOT [1].\nThe first part of the expression represents a double potential well problem\nillustrated by Fig 1. The HN (t) represents a small, time dependent, random\nnoise term. This will be used to simulate the decoherence effects. These could\nbe due to either actual noise sources in the laboratory like stray fields, or true\nquantum mechanical decoherence due to unavoidable interactions of the simple\nidealized system with other variables.\nThe parameter xext controls the asymmetry of the two potential wells, xext =\n0 being the completely symmetric situation where the energy splitting between\nthe two lowest levels \u03c9tunnel is only due to the tunneling through the barrier.\nThe height and width of the barrier are controlled by \u03b2. In the previous work\nit was found that the values \u03bc = Vo = 16.3; \u03b2 = 1.19 give behavior suitable for\nquantum logic elements and we shall use these values in our simulations here. As\nseen on the figure, with these values there is a well defined pair of levels below\nthe barrier. At the same time the barrier is low, giving a relatively large tunnel\nsplitting. This permits the adiabatic sweeps, on which the gate operations are\nbased, to be fast. For these values one has \u03c9tunnel = 0.0044.\nFor the SQUID, these parameters\nare related to the inductance L and capacq\nitance C by \u03bc = Vo \u2248 1030\n\nC/pF\nL/pH . The parameter \u03b2\nc\n. (We use ~, c\n= 2\u03c0LI\n\u221a \u03a6o\n\ncharacterizes the critical\n\n= 1 units.) The overall\ncurrent Ic and is given by \u03b2\n\u221a\nenergy scale is given by Eo = 1/ LC and the time unit by 1/Eo = LC. Thus\nthe time unit is 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 seconds \u00d7 (L/pH C/pF )1/2 . With L = 400pH and\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Double well potentials (Vo term) of the hamiltonian Eq 1, with the first\nfour energy levels indicated. The left panel shows the symmetric configuration\nwith xext = 0 while the right one shows an asymmetric configuration with\nxext = 0.0020. The behavior of the two lowest levels is well represented by an\neffective hamiltonian H = 21 \u03c3V, where Vx is given by the tunneling energy and\nVz by the asymmetry of the wells.\nC = 0.1pF for example, \u03c9tunnel = 0.0044 corresponds to \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 eV . The\ntime unit is then 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 sec. [2].\nThe numerical methods are as outlined in [1], as introduced in [3]. A large\nbasis of harmonic oscillator states is employed, and the resulting sparse hamiltonian matrix is inverted to find the energy eigenstates. The time evolution is\nfound by repeated application of (1 + 12 iH\u2206t)/(1 \u2212 12 iH\u2206t).\n\n3\n\nTwo-State System\n\nThe previous studies have shown that there is a range of parameter values where\nthe two lowest levels for Eq 1 can be adequately represented as an effective two\nlevel system with hamiltonian H = 21 \u03c3V.\nWe use an (x,y,z) coordinate system for the various vectors in the following\nway. V is approximately in the 'z' or 'up' direction when xext is relatively large\nso that the potential is asymmetric and the energy level splitting is essentially\ndetermined by the distance between the bottoms of the potential wells. V is in\nthe 'x' direction or 'horizontal' when xext = 0 and the energy splitting is determined only by the tunneling through the barrier. Specifically, one determines\n[1] the components of V to be Vz \u2248 2Vo xext xc and Vx = \u03c9tunnel , the tunneling\nenergy. The quantity xc is the value of the x-coordinate where the wavefunction\nis centered when the wavefunction is localized in just one of the potential wells.\nFor the parameter values used here this is always close to 1, about 0.9. The value\nof \u03c9tunnel , namely =0.0044, is obtained from the numerical solutions as the level\nsplitting for xext = 0, with the chosen parameters \u03bc = Vo = 16.3; \u03b2 = 1.19.\nAccording to [1], deviations from the two-state model begin to appear when\nthe level splitting for the lowest pair becomes comparable to the distance to the\nnext set of levels. Various tests showed that the effective two-state description\nwas good up to about xext \u2248 0.01, where the level splitting was 0.30.\n3\n\n\fTo represent the noise in this approximate two-state picture, we assume\nan additional term 12 \u03c3B in the two-state hamiltonian with a time dependent\nrandom field B. The effective total two-state hamiltonian is then\nH = 21 \u03c3V + 21 \u03c3B .\n\n(2)\n\nB thus represents a rapid small stochastic addition [5] to the V. Just as for\nthe components of V, it is possible to establish relations between the B and the\nparameters of HN . These will be given in section 7.\n\n4\n\nDensity Matrix\n\nOur object of study is the density matrix of the system. In our random noise\nmodel we generate it by inserting a particular realization N a (t) of a noise signal\nin the hamiltonian Eq 1 and then evolving an initial wavefunction to a final\ntime with this hamiltonian H a . Repeating the process, and averaging over\nmany different noise realizations, N, gives a final density matrix:\n\u03c1(t) =\n\n\u03c8\u03c8 \u2020\n\nN\n1 X a\n=\n\u03c8 (t)\u03c8 a\u2020 (t) .\nN a=1\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough the evolution is unitary for a given N a (t), the averaging process is\nnot and the procedure evidently violates unitarity. The resulting density matrix\nwill thus exhibit a time-dependent decoherence, which we wish to examine.\nIn particular we would like to study the decoherence for the effective twolevel system comprised of the lowest states of the hamiltonian, with its 2 \u00d7 2\ndensity matrix. However, for the calculations with the full Eq 1, it must be noted\nthat the resulting numerical density matrix Eq 3 is a function of two continuous\nvariables in \u03c1(x\u2032 , x). Thus in principle Eq 3 refers not only to the two lowest\nstates of the hamiltonian, but to the entire Hilbert space of the continuous x\nvariable.\nNevertheless, in the previous studies it was found that in the region of parameter space where the two-state description is valid, the Hilbert space of\nlowest states is accurately spanned by one and the same set of wavefunctions\neven as the parameters of the hamiltonian are varied and the energy eigenstates\nchange [4]. Therefore wavefunctions beginning in the two-state space remain\nthere, and the results of evolving with Eq 1 can be expressed in the two-state\nspace by projecting them onto the corresponding pair of wavefunctions. This\nis the procedure we will follow in the numerical evaluation of the 2 \u00d7 2 density\nmatrix.\nOn the other hand, for the simplified two-state or spin 1/2 system represented by Eq 2, the density matrix can be predicted analytically, as will be\nexplained in section 5. This analytical result may be compared with that for\nthe numerical procedure just described, where we insert the noise signal in Eq 1.\nTo carry out this comparison one needs a translation between the noise signal\n\n4\n\n\finserted in HN and the equivalent B in Eq 2. This translation will be given in\nsection 7.\nThe two-state density matrix can be parameterized in terms of Pauli matrices\nas\n\u03c1 = 12 (1 + P * \u03c3) .\n(4)\nWith our coordinate conventions P is in the \"up\" or \"down\" or \u00b1z direction\nwhen the wavefunction is localized in one of the potential wells of Fig 1; and it\nis in the \"horizontal\" or \u00b1 x direction when the wavefunction is the symmetric\nor antisymmetric combination of states in both potential wells. |P| = P = 1\ncorresponds to pure state and P < 1 a mixed state.\nIn the two-state model the \"polarization\" vector P evolves according to [14]\n\u1e56 = P \u00d7 V \u2212 D PT ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the \u2212D PT term represents the quantum damping or loss of coherence.\nD is the decoherence rate and D\u22121 is the decoherence time. This term reduces\nthe components P transverse to the direction chosen by the noise or decoherence\ninteraction.\nAlthough in the present paper we concentrate on situations with constant\nparameters in the hamiltonian (aside from the noise term), in previous work time\ndependent V 's were used. These may be employed to realize adiabatic quantum\nlogic gates [1], and via the adiabatic method to give a direct measurement of D\nby a turning on-and-off of the classical-quantum transition [8].\n\n5\n\nD in the two-state model\n\nWe now consider how the decoherence or damping and the associated parameter\nD are generated by the random noise in the two-state picture of Eq 2. The V\nare assumed constant or slowly varying over the time period necessary to find\nthe decoherence effects induced by the random fields. The method is essentially\nthe same as in Ref [1] but we would like to present it in a somewhat more general\nform. This is nicely done by following Ref [9]. One considers the density matrix\n\u03c1 = 21 (1+P * \u03c3) in the Heisenberg representation. The P are also assumed to be\nslowly varying so that at a given time one may assume a certain initial density\nmatrix which we call \u03c1(0).\nIn Eq 3 one may denote each of the terms on the right as \u03c1a , so that \u03c1 = \u03c1a .\nWe then examine the density matrix equation \u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[H(t), \u03c1] term by term\n\u03c1\u0307a = \u2212i[H a (t), \u03c1a ] ,\n\n(6)\n\niteratively: \u03c1(t) \u2248 \u03c1(0) + \u03c11 + \u03c12 . The different orders refer to how many factors\nof the small B occur and one compares equations with the same number of B's\n[6]. Since we will assume the average value of the random fields B to be set to\nzero (or incorporated in the main hamiltonian), the first order contribution to\nthe average \u03c1\u0307 is zero: \u03c1\u03071 = \u2212i[\u03c3B, \u03c1(0)] = 0. We thus consider the second order\nfor \u03c1\u0307\n5\n\n\f\u03c1\u0307a2 (t) = \u2212i 21 [\u03c3Ba , \u03c1a1 ] = \u2212 41 [\u03c3Ba , [\u03c3Ca , \u03c1(0)] ]\n(7)\nRt \u2032\nwhere we introduce the shorthand C(t) = 0 dt B(t\u2032 ) and use \u03c11 = \u2212i 12 [\u03c3C, \u03c1(0)].\nNow in performing the average over the random fields in Eq 7, we will have\nto do with bilinear correlators between the vector components of B, C. These\ncan be thought of as tensors of the type Xi Yj , where the average is over different\nrealizations of the random fields. With just one random field in a fixed direction\ne, one has\nX \u2297 Y = C e \u2297 e\u2020\n(8)\n\nfor the tensor, where C represents some quadratic correlator.\nBy making repeated use 1 of [\u03c3X, \u03c3Y] = i2\u03c3X \u00d7 Y and comparing the\nresulting coefficients of \u03c3, Eq 7 implies\n\u1e56 = BC(e \u00d7 (e \u00d7 P)) .\n\n(9)\n\nTo evaluate the correlator BC we use the basic result from the theory of staRt\ntionary random noise that the quantity ( 0 B(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 )2 = 2tA, where A is the\ntime integral of the autocorrelation function\nZ \u221e\nB(0)B(t)dt .\n(10)\nA=\n0\n\nThen\nBC = B(t)\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nB(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 =\n0\n\n1\n2\n\nd\ndt\n\n\u0012Z\n\nt\n\nB(t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n0\n\n\u00132\n\n=A.\n\n(11)\n\nAs is evident when taking the scalar product with e, the cross product\nexpression represents the component of P perpendicular to the respective e, i.e.\nwith the component along e removed. So we may call ((eP)e \u2212 P)= \u2212PT with\n\"T\" for transverse.\nWe therefore obtain that the D in Eq 5 is given by\nD=A\n\n(12)\n\nEq 12 has the typical form of a dissipative parameter related to the integral over\nthe autocorrelation function for a fluctuating quantity[10].\nOne can also handle more than one noise source by this method. With two\nindependent random fields, along the fixed directions e1 and e2 , we will have a\ntensor of the form\nX \u2297 Y = C 1 e1 \u2297 e1 \u2020 + C 2 e2 \u2297 e2 \u2020 .\n\n(13)\n\nThat is, different noise effects can be added up separately and do not interfere\nwith each other. This is due to the assumed independence of the two noise\nsignals. Note the e1 and e2 need not be orthogonal.\n1 This is the first point where one uses the properties of the \u03c3 as Pauli matrices. Otherwise\nthey could have been any group generators, in which case the cross product formulas are\nreplaced by bilinear products of structure constants [9]\n\n6\n\n\fThus according to Eq 13, for the case of two independent noise signals Eq 9\ngeneralizes to\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u1e56 = A1 ((e1 P)e1 \u2212 P) + A2 ((e2 P)e2 \u2212 P)) .\n(14)\n\nCalling (e1 P)e1 \u2212 P = \u2212PT1 ,and (e2 P)e2 \u2212 P = \u2212PT2 we thus find that\nthe old [14] rotation- decoherence equation Eq 5 now becomes\n\u1e56 = P \u00d7 V \u2212 D1 PT 1 \u2212 D2 PT 2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith\nD1 = A1\n\nD2 = A2\n\n(16)\n\nConcerning dimensions, B is an energy in view of its role in the hamiltonian,\nand so A via Eq 10 is also an energy, which matches the units of D.\nThe conclusion Eq 15 could also have been arrived by an intuitive argument\nwhere one imagines turning off one noise signal for a short time and then repeating the process with the other noise signal turned off. One would then obtain\nfirst the results of Eq 5 with respect to one direction and then with respect to\nthe other direction. The net result would correspond to Eq 15.\nAs said, the e's can be in any direction, not necessarily orthogonal; and since\nthe independent addition of signals in Eq 13 holds for any number of different\nsignals, evidently Eq 15 can be extended to more than two noise signals by\nsimply adding a \u2212D PT term for each. It is of course essential that the different\nnoise signals be uncorrelated.\nThe length of P is always decreasing with an equation of the type Eq 15 and\nthese considerations can be given an interpretation in terms of the increase of\nentropy [15]. In particular we note a formula for the decrease of the length of\nP (squared):\n1\n2\n\nd 2\nP = P * \u1e56 = \u2212P * (D1 PT1 + D2 PT2 ) = \u2212D1 PT1 2 \u2212 D2 PT2 2 ,\ndt\n\n(17)\n\nfor the case of two independent decoherence or noise signals as in Eq 15.\nConcerning the necessity of considerating more than one noise source, it is\npossible or indeed likely that there are noise and decoherence effects on more\nthan one aspect or component of a system. For the SQUID, for example, there\nmight be external flux noise giving fluctuations in xext and at the same time\neffects in the Josephson circuit amounting to fluctuations in \u03b2. Such a situation\nwould be described by Eq 15.\nWith only one noise \"axis\" the decoherence problem may be viewed as one\nof random phases or rotations around that axis, as was done in [1] for flux noise\nin the SQUID. This is sometimes called \"dephasing\", and D is the associated\ndiffusion parameter. Thus it may be said that Eq 15 gives the formula for the\nevolution when there is more than one \"dephasing\"axis.\n\n7\n\n\f6\n\nNoise Models\n\nWe shall consider different types of noise signals N (t). Noise signals are characterized by their power spectrum P(\u03c9), which is theRfourier transform of the au\u221e\ntocorrelation function N (0)N (t), namely P(\u03c9) = 0 dt cos\u03c9t N (0)N (t). One\nsuch power spectrum is \"white noise\" with a cutoff \u03c9c :\nP(\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c92\n\n\u03c9c2\n.\n+ \u03c9c2\n\n(18)\n\nThis is a constant or white noise spectrum up to frequency \u03c9c , and then falls off\nas 1/\u03c9 2 at high frequency. This was used in a simplified way in [1]. In section 11\nbelow we will discuss some examples using this kind of noise.\nIn addition, we also use planckian spectra corresponding to 1, 2, or 3 spatial\ndimensions. With these we can to try to represent a thermal background and\nas will be explained below, allows us to conveniently compare cases with and\nwithout noise power at zero frequency. They also allow a simple variation of the\nfrequency content by changing T which is a \"temperature \" parameter characterizing the frequency spectrum, with an exponential cutoff above \u03c9 \u223c T . For\nn=1 we take the planckian form\nP(\u03c9) =\n\n(\u03c9/T )\n\u22121\n\nn=1.\n\ne\u03c9/T\n\n(19)\n\nWe have fixed the normalizations in Eq 19 and Eq 18 such that P(0) = 1.\nThis condition corresponds to setting the time integral of the autocorrelation\nfunction equal to one:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\nP(0) =\ndt N (0)N (t) = \u03a3a\ndt N a (0)N a (t) = 1 ,\n(20)\nN\no\no\nwhere N a (t) is a particular realization \"a\" of the signal, and we have generated\nN such signals. This convention is particularly convenient since according to\nEq 12 the decoherence parameter D is simply proportional to just this time\nintegral of the autocorrelation function. With this standardized normalization\nof the noise signal we will regulate its overall strength in different applications\nby an adjustable small coupling factor.\nThe planckian forms corresponding to spatial dimensions n=2 and n=3 cannot be normalized in this way since they contain extra powers of \u03c9, giving\nvanishing noise power at \u03c9 = 0. We therefore choose to normalize them such\nthat the variance of the signals, which is a measure of their magnitude, is equal\nto that for n=1 at the same T.\nThis leads to the following definitions\nP(\u03c9) =\n=\n\n(\u03c9/T )2\n\u03c02\n12 \u03b6(3) e\u03c9/T \u2212 1\n5 (\u03c9/T )3\n2\u03c0 2 e\u03c9/T \u2212 1\n8\n\nn=2\nn=3.\n\n(21)\n\n\fThe variance of the signal corresponds to theR integral over the power spec\u221e\ntrum, so with these normalizations the integral 0 d\u03c9P(\u03c9) is the same for all\nthree signals in Eq 19 and Eq 21.\nSpecifically, one finds\nZ\n\u03c0\n2 \u221e\n(22)\nd\u03c9 P(\u03c9) = T\nN2 =\n\u03c0 0\n3\nFor T=0.025, which we\n\u221a shall use in many of the simulations, this gives a\ntypical signal strength of N 2 = 0.16. RAs we shall see below in section 10, the\n\u221e\ncase of noise signals with the property o dtN (0)N (t) = 0, as in Eq 21, are of\nspecial interest.\nTo numerically generate a particular signal N a (t) as a realization of one\nof the above models, we work with a discretized fourier space where N (t) =\n\u03a3\u03c9 N\u03c9 ei\u03c9t . A given random set a of the N\u03c9 then determines the signal. We\nhave used two procedure to generate the N\u03c9 . \u221a\nIn the random phase procedure, one takes P(\u03c9) times a random phase ei\u03b8\nwith \u03b8 chosen randomly and uniformly in the interval 0 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2265 2\u03c0.\nIn the gaussian modulus method one chooses a real and imaginary part of\nN\u03c9 randomly from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance P(\u03c9).\nBoth methods lead to an ensemble with the power spectrum \u223c P(\u03c9). We find\nthat both procedures lead to very similar results in our simulations.\nFigure 2 shows some samples of the different noise signals. The upper curve\nis for Eq 18. One sees the presence of the high frequency tail in the power\nspectrum. The middle curve is for the planckian n=3, Eq 21, and the lower curve\nfor the planckian n=1, Eq 19. These latter two differ in that for n=3 there is no\npower at zero frequency, while for n=1 it is present. The temperature T=0.025\nor \u03c9c is the same for all three. It will \u221a\nbe seen that the amplitude of the signals\nis roughly in accord with Eq 22, with N 2 = 0.16.\n\n7\n\nRelation Between HN and B\n\nIn this section we determine the relations between the random B of the two-state\ndescription Eq 2 and the noise term in the full hamiltonian Eq 1. Given these\nrelations, we will be able to compare the results of a full numerical simulation\nwith Eq 1 and the analytical predictions from Eq 12.\nAs explained below, noise in the 'z' direction arises through fluctuations in\nxext , and in the 'x' direction, fluctuations in \u03b2. In the case of the SQUID these\ncorrespond to noise/decoherence in the external flux and in the junction circuit,\nrespectively. It is quite plausible that they should correspond to independent\nnoise sources.\n\n7.1\n\nNoise in the \"z-direction\"\n\nWe thus consider adding a noise term representing a fluctuation of xext in Eq 1:\nHN = \u03b4xext Vo x = \u03b4\u03b7 N (t)Vo x .\n9\n\n(23)\n\n\f0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nFigure 2: Samples of noise signals N (t). Upper curve: Cut-off white noise from\nEq 18 with cutoff \u03c9c = 0.025. Middle curve: planckian noise for n=3 as in Eq 21\nwith T=0.025. Lower curve: planckian noise for n=1 as in Eq 19 with T=0.025.\nThe signals are normalized to have the same variance or integrated noise power\nbut differ in having zero (middle) or non-zero (upper and lower) noise power at\nzero frequency. The high frequency tail present in the power spectrum of the\nupper, non-planckian, curve is evident. With L = 400pH and C = 0.1pF for\nthe SQUID, the time unit in this and all further plots would be 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 sec.\nWe call the fluctuation \u03b4xext and for a particular noise signal \"a\" it is represented\nby \u03b4\u03b7 N a (t) with \u03b4\u03b7 an overall coupling strength. By using the identification\nx \u2248 xc \u03c3z (see section 3) connecting the operator x of the full hamiltonian with\nthe \u03c3 of the spin 1/2 picture, on sees that this HN is equivalent [5] to the B\nfield of the two-state model as :\nBz = 2V0 xc \u03b4\u03b7N ,\n\n(24)\n\nwith other B components zero. We therefore predict, according to Eq 12, that\nwhen using a noise signal normalized with P(0) = 1 as explained in section 6, a\ndecoherence constant from the full simulation with Eq 1\nZ \u221e\nBz (0)Bz (t)dt = 4(V0 xc \u03b4\u03b7)2 = 0.89 \u00d7 103 (\u03b4\u03b7)2 ,\n(25)\nD=\n0\n\nwhere in the last step we insert V0 = 16.3, xc = 0.9.\n10\n\n\f7.2\n\nNoise in the \"x-direction\"\n\nSwitching to the \"x-direction\", we consider the effect of small variations of \u03b2 in\nEq 1, amounting to fluctuations in the barrier potential. Since \u03b2 regulates the\ntunneling, a change in \u03b2 induces a change in the tunneling energy. Thus in the\ntwo-state hamiltonian Eq 2 a variation in \u03b2 induces (apart from an unimportant\nconstant shift) a change in the \u03c3x term, a Bx . Other components of B are zero.\nTo obtain the magnitude of Bx [12], one notes that the coefficient of \u03c3x is\nthe tunnel splitting; Vx + Bx = \u03c9tunnel + \u03b4\u03c9tunnel . Thus Bx = \u03b4\u03c9tunnel =\n\u03b4\u03b2 d\u03c9tunnel\n.\nd\u03b2\n\nz\n\nN\n\nP\n\nV\nx\n\nFigure 3: Typical configuration of vectors used in the simulations. With no\ndamping the polarization vector P rotates around V , so with V in the xdirection there are oscillating components Pz , Py . For D not too large these are\ndamped oscillations as the component of P perpendicular to the noise direction\nN or B is reduced. For very strong D, P is \"pinned\" along the noise vector,\ncorresponding to the \"Collapse of the Wavefunction\". The initial P is of unit\nlength and along the z-axis for Figs 5 and 6, while for Fig 7 it lies at 45 degrees\nin the x-z plane.\nAlthough there are analytic methods of evaluating tunneling energies, they\ninvolve exponentially sensitive effects and it seems best to find d\u03c9tunnel\nfrom\nd\u03b2\nour previous numerical results. In the vicinity of \u03b2 = 1.19, (and with V0 = \u03bc =\n16.3 where we carry out our simulations) examination of Table II of [1] yields\nd\u03c9tunnel\n\u2248 \u22120.18 near \u03b2 = 1.19. Thus, for fluctuations around \u03b2 = 1.19 the B\nd\u03b2\n11\n\n\ffield associated with a change in \u03b2 is\nBx = \u03b4\u03b2\n\nd\u03c9tunnel\n= (\u22120.18)\u03b4\u03b2 = (\u22120.18)\u03b4\u03b2o N ,\nd\u03b2\n\n(26)\n\nWe write the fluctuations in \u03b2 as \u03b4\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b2o N , with N one of our noise signals\nand \u03b4\u03b20 a strength parameter. According to Eq 12, when N has the integral of\nthe autocorrelation function normalized to one,\nD = 0.032 \u03b4\u03b2o2 .\n\n(27)\n\nFor the numerical calculations, we wish to insert the same \u03b4\u03b2 fluctuations\nin Eq 1. Since x2 /2 is the leading term in cos x which contributes to the level\nsplitting, a small variation in \u03b2 can be adequately represented by adding a term\n\u03b4\u03b2 Vo x2 /2 in the full hamiltonian. We thus should set, in Eq 1\nHN = \u2212\u03b4\u03b2 Vo 21 x2 = \u2212\u03b4\u03b2 o N Vo 12 x2 .\n\n7.3\n\n(28)\n\nComparison of x and z-noise\n\nOur two examples of 'z-noise' and 'x-noise' are instructive in that the effective\nB fields for the two-state system Eq 24 and Eq 26 and the associated D's, Eq 25\nand Eq 27 differ widely for similar noise signals. The difference originates in\nthe fact that the 'z-noise' operator is linear \u223c x, while the 'x-noise' operator is\nquadratic \u223c x2 . The two lowest states comprising our two-state system have,\nwith xext = 0, odd or even parity. Thus they will be strongly connected by the\nparity odd x operator. For the x2 operator on the other hand the change in the\nenergy splitting is only due to the different shifts of the two states under x2 and\nso is much smaller. For xext 6= 0 but small the situation will be qualitatively\nsimilar.\nThus the symmetry properties associated with the noise or decoherence can\nbe important. With specific devices this may suggest a choice of operating\nconditions where the effects can be minimized.\n\n8\n\nTests by Numerical Simulation\n\nWe turn to numerical tests of the formalism and the above results Eq 25 and\nEq 27 of the spin- 21 picture. We check them against results from the full hamiltonian Eq 1 with the corresponding HN , namely Eq 23 or Eq 28, inserted in the\nhamiltonian. We find the decoherence parameter D from a fit to the damping of\n|P| in the numerical calculations and compare it with the analytic predictions.\nFor our various tests we chose a coupling \u03b4\u03b7 such that the decoherence time\n1/D is on the order of some thousands of time units. For the typical SQUID\nparameters of mentioned in the introduction this corresponds to a decoherence\ntime in the tens of nanoseconds.\n\n12\n\n\fDiagonal element of the density matrix\n\nT=0.05\nT=0.10\nT=0.20\nT=0.30\nT=0.40\nT=0.45\nT=0.50\nT=0.80\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n25000\n\n50000\n\n75000\nTime\n\n100000\n\n125000\n\nFigure 4: Excitation to higher states. When the noise power spectrum contains\nfrequencies above that of the principal level spacing, here 0.4, the diagonal\nelements of the 2x2 density matrix fall below 1/2. When it does not contain\nthese frequencies the relaxation is to 1/2.\n\n8.1\n\nParameter Ranges\n\nThere will be certain conditions on the range of parameters where the analytical\narguments can be applied.\nOne condition concerns large perturbations, where the nature of the system\nis changed substantially. These are evidently beyond the scope of the theoretical\nmethod, and would have to be dealt with simply by simulation alone. This is\nparticularly relevant in our example of \u03b2 fluctuations or 'x- noise' where the\ntunneling energy is very small and \u03b2 fluctuations have a relatively large effect.\nThis is discussed in sect.8.4.\nA second condition concerns the frequency spectrum of the noise, as characterized by the T or the \u03c9c of the noise power spectra. If the dominant noise\nfrequencies are too low, on the order of, or less than the important frequencies\nof the system, this is in contradiction to our assumption that the system can\nbe taken as constant over many cycles of the noise [13]. In sect 11 we shall\ndiscuss some features of low frequency noise. On the other hand, if the frequencies in the noise are too high, one risks exciting higher states and so violating\nour assumption of an effective two-state system. Since the important system\nfrequency we deal with is \u03c9tunnel = 0.0044, and the distance to the next set\n\n13\n\n\fV\n(0.0044, 0.0, 0.0)\n(0.0044, 0.0, 0.0)\n(0.0044,0.0,0.006)\n(0.0044,0.0,0.02)\n\nPinitial\n(1,0,0)\n(0,0,1)\n(1, 0.0, \u22121) \u221a12\n(1,0,0)\n\nD\n0.00134\n0.00122\n0.00118\n0.00141\n\nTable 1: Study of the constancy of D for various starting conditions. A n=1\nplanckian noise in the 'z-direction' with T = 0.05 is used. The coupling is\n\u03b4\u03b7 = 0.00128, for which the prediction Eq 25 is D = 0.00146. In the first two\nentries V is along the x-axis while the starting P is first along the x-axis and\nin the second line along the z-axis. In the third entry V is close to 45 degrees\nwith the z-axis and P starts orthogonal to it in the lower hemisphere. In the\nlast and fourth entry V makes an angle of only 12 degrees with the z-axis and\nP starts along the x-axis. One observes that at about the 20% level the value\nof D is the same for the various examples and near to the predicted value. The\nnotation for the vectors refers to (x, y, z).\nof levels is about 0.4, one has the condition 0.0044 << T, \u03c9c << 0.4. This\ncriterion applies of course for our typical configurations and would have to be\nadjusted for others.\nThe excitation to higher states above that of our effective two- level system\ncan be detected in that the diagonal elements of the 2x2 density matrix will relax\nnot to 1/2, but to some smaller value, reflecting the missing probability. We can\nperform an amusing numerical experiment on this by using a 'rectangular' noise\npower spectrum P(\u03c9) which is exactly zero above some \u03c9 = T . The resulting\nbehavior of the density matrix is shown in Fig 4 for various values of T.\nIf the noise power does not contain frequencies equal or higher than those\nneeded to go to the next set of states, the density matrix should relax to 1/2.\nWith our typical parameters, this frequency is about 0.4. In Fig 4 it is seen that\nwhen the maximum noise frequency is below this value the relaxation is indeed\nto 1/2. With higher frequencies present the relaxation is to less than 1/2. (That\nit falls to 1/4 reflects the fact that the numerical calculations were carried out\nin a 4-state basis.)\nAlthough our various noise power spectra do not have a simple rectangular\ncutoff, we anticipate a similar behavior with our exponentially cutoff planckian\nspectra. We do indeed find with low T's and couplings that are not too strong\nthat calculations performed with a two-state basis give the same results as basis\nwith more states, indicating that the excitation of higher states is not important.\nThe results we present below are always under these conditions.\n\n8.2\n\nState Independence of D\n\nProbably the most striking aspect of the theory is that, with the given assumptions, the effect of the environment, here represented by the noise, can be\n\n14\n\n\fV\n(0.0044, 0.0, 0.0)\n\nT\n0.0125\n0.025\n0.05\n0.10\n0.20\n\nD\n0.0011\n0.00128\n0.00132\n0.00145\n0.00157\n\n\u03c111\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.45\n\nTable 2: Temperature dependence of the decoherence parameter D determined\nfrom the numerical simulations using noise signals in the 'z- direction' with\nthe power spectrum Eq 19 and coupling \u03b4\u03b7 = 0.00128. According to Eq 25, D\nshould be temperature independent and have the value 0.00146. The final value\nof the density matrix element \u03c111 should be 21 if there is no excitation of higher\nstates above the effective two-state system. The last entry for \u03c111 shows some\ndeviation from this as T approaches the principal level spacing 0.4.\nrepresented by a single parameter D. Most importantly, D does not depend on\nthe state of the system. This means that Eq 5 is a linear equation for P . This\nwould not be the case, for example, if one had D = D(P ). Linearity for the\nevolution of the density matrix is a general result of quantum mechanics and it\nis non-trivial that our approximate method respects this.\nWe can provide some tests of this feature in the full numerical simulation.\nOne may take a given noise signal with a given coupling and determine D for\ndifferent configurations of the potentials and of the initial state. In Table 1\nwe show some examples, using 'z-noise' with the parameter \u03b4\u03b7 = 0.00128, for\nwhich, according to Eq 25, the prediction is D=0.00146.\nThe first two entries are for symmetric potentials, xext = 0, that is with\nV in the x-direction. For the first line the system is started with P also in the\nx-direction, that is with a wavefunction which is a linear combination of equal\nwavepackets in the left and right potential wells. In the second line the system\nis started with P in the z-direction, corresponding to the initial wavefunction\nconcentrated in only one potential well. In the next two entries we show the\ncase of some asymmetric potentials, so that V lies at some angle in the x-z\nplane. In the third line V is at a 45 degree angle, and in the fourth line close\nto the z-axis at a 12 degree angle.\n\n8.3\n\nTest for 'z-noise'\n\nWe now examine the nature of the evolution with \"noise along the z-axis\". With\nV along the x-axis, Fig 3 shows this situation with P in some general direction.\nIn a first test we start P along the z-direction again with coupling \u03b4\u03b7 =\n0.00128. One anticipates that P will rotate around the x-axis while its length\ndecreases. Inserting Eq 23 in Eq 1, evaluating the density matrix and extracting\nP one finds the results shown in Fig 5.

The configuration corresponds to Fig 3 with P started along the zaxis. Left: Projection of P on the z-axis showing damped oscillations. Right:\nDamping of the total length of P . A fit for the length with e\u2212Dt yields D =\n0.00132, while the prediction from Eq 25 is D = 0.00146. The error bars indicate\ntheqdispersion of values expected for an average made from N samples, namely\n1\nN\n\n2\n\u03a3N\n1 (Pa \u2212 P ) , where Pa is the quantity being plotted, resulting from a given\nnoise signal 'a'.\n\nThe value of D emerging from the simulation is found by fitting e\u2212Dt to the\ncurve of the right panel, yielding D=0.00132. On the other hand the prediction\nfrom Eq 25 is D=0.00146. Thus there is good agreement.\nThese plots were produced using the n=1 planckian noise Eq 19. It is a\nfeature of the prediction Eq 25 with fixed \u03b4\u03b7 that the D resulting from the\nsimulation should be given by P(0) and independent of T, even though a change\nof T implies a change in the frequencies present in the noise.\nTo test this, Table 2 shows the values of D resulting from various T's used\nin simulations with n=1 planckian noise. The first and last values of the temperature are near the margins of the allowed region 0.0044 << T, \u03c9c << 0.4.\nOne observes approximate agreement with the analytic prediction D=0.00146.\nAt the highest temperature the excitation to states above the lowest two states\nmanifests itself in the relaxation of the density matrix element to a value less\nthan 12 .\nThese results are meant simply as a check on our numerical and mathematical methods and should not be taken to mean that the decoherence is temperature independent. To the contrary, a temperature dependence is rather to be\nexpected. With the normalizations we have adopted, it would be represented\nby a temperature dependence of the coupling parameter \u03b4\u03b7.\n\n8.4\n\nTest for 'x-noise'\n\nFluctuations in \u03b2 correspond to changes in the tunneling energy, a \u03c3x operator\nin our notation. As was discussed in section 7.3, fluctuations in \u03b2 have relatively\n\n16\n\n\fsmall effects compared to similar fluctuations in the xext parameter, leading to\na much smaller D for \u03b2 fluctuations or 'x-noise'.\nIf for the purpose of comparing the analytic and numerical predictions, we\nwere to increase the coupling constant \u03b4\u03b2o in the simulations, there is the difficulty that using a larger \u03b4\u03b2 will induce substantial changes in the small tunneling energy, violating our assumption that the fluctuations do not essentially\nchange the system. For example, we work with Vx = \u03c9tunnel = 0.0044, and\naccording to Eq 26 the Bx induced by a \u03b4\u03b2 is (\u22120.18)\u03b4\u03b2o N . If we wish to have\nBx << 0.0044 with the typical size of noise signals 0.16 (see sect.6), then we\nrequire \u03b4\u03b2o << 0.01, which implies D on the 10\u22126 level, according to Eq 27.\nWhile such small effects can be unstable and difficult to detect numerically,\nwe show in Fig 6 a run for xext = 0 with the coupling \u03b4\u03b2o = 0.01. The temperature for n=1 planckian noise was set to T=0.05. A fit gives D = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\nwhile the prediction of Eq 27 is D = 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 . Although there is qualitative\nagreement, it is evidently not so precise as in the case of the z-noise. This may\nbe due to our various approximations as well as numerical uncertainties.\nLength of the polarization vector\n\n1\n\nPz\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1 0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6 0\n\n10000\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nFigure 6: Relaxation due to \u03b2 fluctuations or \"x-noise\".

A fit to the length with e\u2212Dt yields\nD = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 , while the prediction from Eq 25 is D = 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 . A weak\ncoupling \u03b4\u03b2o = 0.01 implying weak damping must be used to avoid a large shift\n\u03b4\u03c9tunnel /\u03c9tunnel .\n\n9\n\n\"Collapse\" and \"Watched Pot\"\n\nSince the beginnings of quantum mechanics the \"Collapse of the Wavefunction\"\nhas been assumed to be an instantaneous and somewhat mysterious process, not\ndescribable in a physical manner. However, as was noted in the beginning of\nstudies of decoherence [14], the action of the external influences, here simulated\nby the noise, may be quantitatively examined and the induction of a \"Collapse\nof the Wavefunction\"-like behavior of the system studied. This occurs through\nthe effect of the \u2212DPT term, which tends to eliminate off- diagonal matrix\nelements of the density matrix and so to reduce the density matrix to a clas-\n\n17\n\n\fsical probability distribution, an incoherent mixture of the states of a definite\n\"quality\", the eigenstates of \u03c3z .\nAs the external influence, represented by D, becomes very strong, the \"Collapse of the Wavefunction\" occurs very rapidly. In addition, the further evolution of the system is inhibited and in the limit can be essentially stopped\ncompletely [14]\u2013much like the 'fixing' of the state by a 'measurement'. This is\nthe \"Turing\" or \"Watched Pot\" effect. In terms of Eq 5 this occurs because the\nlarge D \"pins\" P to the noise axis so there is a very small PT and very little\nsubsequent damping.\n\n9.1\n\nStrong Damping with N , V Perpendicular\n\nWith our present system we can illustrate and study such effects quantitatively.\nLet the initial P be chosen to have length one (pure state) and be oriented at\nan angle such that both Pz and Px components are substantial. Fig 3 indicates\nsuch a starting condition. If there is a strong noise along the z-axis, Px will\nrapidly disappear: there is a \"Collapse of the Wavefunction\" to an incoherent\nmixture of \"up\" and \"down\" states. After this \"collapse\" the large value of Dz\ninhibits further evolution\u2013 the \"Watched Pot\" effect.\nFig 7 shows a simulation for such conditions. The length of P is plotted. One\nobserves a rapid decrease of the length until only the original Pz survives. The\nwavefunction \"collapses\" in a very short time . After this, the length remains\n\"frozen\" to this value\u2013the \"Watched Pot\" effect. Increasing D gives a faster\n\"collapse\" and a stronger \"watching\". As with the other simulations, the full\nhamiltonian Eq 1 is used here.\nThe parameter characterizing \"strong\" or \"weak\" damping is the ratio D/\u03c9,\nwhere \u03c9 = V is the energy splitting of the two levels or the magnitude of V .\nThis follows from Eq 5, where dividing through by V yields a dimensionless time\nparameter t\u03c9 and the parameters D/\u03c9. For small D/\u03c9 one has weakly damped\nprecession of the P vector around V. For D/\u03c9 >> 1 one enters the \"Watched\nPot\" regime.\nExamination of the solutions of Eq 5 for V in the x- direction with Vx =\n\u03c9tunnel and P initially in the z- direction leads to the behavior [14]\n2\n\nPz \u2248 e\u2212t(Vx /D)\n\n(29)\n\nfor P initially along the z-axis. This result follows from combining the z and y\ncomponents of Eq 5 to give the equation P \u0308z + DP \u0307z + Vx2 Pz = 0 and solving for\nlarge D [11]. For very large D the graph in Fig 7 will decrease extremely slowly\n(see Fig 6 of [1]).\n\n9.2\n\nStrong Damping with N , V Nearly Parallel\n\nIn the above case N or B and V were at right angles. This is the usual \"Watched\nPot\" configuration as it has been studied for chiral molecules, neutrinos, or\nthe SQUID with a symmetric potential and dominant flux noise [14] [1].

The plot shows the evolution of the length of P for the configuration\nof Fig 3 with the initial P of length one and at 45 degrees in the x-z plane.\nThe Px component \"collapses\" to zero quickly, giving an incoherent mixture\nof \"up\" and \"down\"states. This is then followed by a near \"freezing\" of the\nevolution. These effects result from the strong noise (or \"measurement\"), here\nwith D/\u03c9 \u2248 100. Note the short time scale, the time unit is the same as in the\nother plots, namely with L = 400pH and C = 0.1pF for a SQUID, the unit is\n6.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 sec.\nall these cases one has\u2013 or it is assumed\u2013, that the observable \"quality\" in\nquestion (chirality, flavor, flux state) is conserved in the interaction with the\nenvironment. Since we take this 'quality' to be represented by an eigenstate of\n\u03c3z , B is necessarily in the z-direction.\nHowever, one may also envision the opposite situation where N and V are\nin the same direction. This would be the case, for example, with a strongly\nasymmetric potential for the SQUID (xext 6= 0) and dominant flux noise. (This\nappears to be the case for the experiment mentioned in ref [13].)\nIn this case the analog to Eq 29 for the long term behavior of the parallel\ncomponent after the perpendicular components have been \"collapsed\" is found\nto be\n2\nDV\n\no\nPparallel \u2248 Pparallel\ne\n\nx\n\u2212t V 2 +D\n2\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\no\nPparallel\nis the component remaining after the initial \"collapse\" and V 2 the\nsquare of V . This result follows from writing Eq 5 as a set of linear equa-\n\n19\n\n\ftions, taking P \u223c e\u2212\u03bbt and solving the determinental equation for the smallest\neigenvalue \u03bb.\nFor D >> V one recovers Eq 29. For D << V there is a new regime with\n2\na suppression due to the large value of V , with the behavior \u223c e\u2212tD\u03b8 where\n\u03b8 = Vx /V . Naturally in the limit where V and N are exactly parallel, P will\nremain constant, as one sees setting Vx = 0 in Eq 30.\n\n10\n\nVanishing Noise Power at Low Frequency\n\nIn the numerical work so far we have assumed that the time integral of the\nautocorrelation function, or equivalently P(0), is non-zero. However a very\ninteresting special case occurs when it is in fact zero as for Eq 21. Then Eq 16\nimplies\nZ\n\u221e\n\nD=0\n\nB(0)B(t) = 0\n\n(31)\n\no\n\nTo check if Eq 31 holds with the full hamiltonian we perform simulations\ncomparing noise signals with planckian power spectra for n=1 and n=3. If\nEq 31 indeed holds there should be little or no relaxation in the n=3 case. Since\nour different signals have been normalized in Eq 19 and Eq 21 to have the same\nvariance N 2 , and the square root of the variance is the typical size of the signal,\nour comparison is with signals of the same 'strength'.\nEmploying these signals for noise in the z direction in Eq 23, we obtain the\nresults shown in Fig 8. The configuration is as in Fig 3 with P started in the\nz-direction and the parameters the same as for Fig 5. The left panel of Fig 8 is\nfor n=1 noise and shows the expected relaxation of Pz . The right panel is for\nn=3 and shows no apparent decoherence or damping effect in the oscillations of\nPz .\nAn examination of the length of P shows that while it goes to zero for n=1,\nfor n=3 it declines by only about 1% over the length of the run.\nThus despite the at first sight similar appearance of the lower two signals\nin Fig 2 there is a great difference in the decoherence they induce and the expectation from Eq 31 is indeed verified in full calculations with Eq 1. The exact\nvanishing of D in Eq 31 is presumably a consequence of the use of second order\nperturbation theory in the derivation and should be lifted in higher order. A\nsimilar run for n=2 shows in fact some weak decoherence, with D at the \u223c 10\u22125\nlevel, perhaps indicative of the higher order effects.\n\n11\n\nVery Low Frequency Noise\n\nEq 5 gives a local-in-time description in terms of a single \"frictional\" or \"dissipative\" constant D. D does not depend on the state of the system (the value\nof P) or on the internal hamiltonian (the value of V). D depends only on\nthe properties of the noise, and our simulations have quantitatively verified\nthis. This simple structure has its origin in the \"random walk\" behavior of\n\n20\n\n\f1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nPz\n\nPz\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1 0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n-1 0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nFigure 8: Identical runs for Pz but with two kinds of noise. Left: Planckian\nnoise power spectrum with n=1 (lower curve of Fig 2), having non-zero power\nat zero frequency. Right: Planckian noise power spectrum with n=3, having\nzero power at zero frequency (middle curve of Fig 2). The two noise signals are\nadjusted so as to have the same variance or integrated noise power. There is a\nstriking difference in the damping or decoherence, even though the equality of\nvariances assures signals of the same \"strength\". The conditions are the same\nas for Fig 5.\nRt\nthe integral of the noise signal 0 B(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 . If B is a random variable then its\nintegral represents a random walk and, as was used in arriving at Eq 10, one\nRt\nhas ( 0 B(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 )2 = 2tA = 2tD, with A the time integral of the autocorrelation\nfunction of the noise.\n\u221a\nR t This is the result of a random walk with steps given by\n2A. Therefore 0 B(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 is gaussian distributed with a variance increasing\nin time as \u223c t, which finally leads to the exponential in time P = e\u2212Dt .\nIf, however, the noise is dominated by very low frequencies [13] such a localin-time description is not relevant and the methods presented in the above\ndiscussions should not be expected to apply. RFor times t small compared to\nt\nthe time scale on which the noise B varies, 0 B(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 is not undergoing a\nrandom walk. Indeed, in the limit a particular realization B a (t) may be taken as\nRt\neffectively constant and one has 0 B a (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 = tB a (0) instead of the t1/2 random\nwalk. The decoherence will now result from the average over the different B a (0).\nA simplest case to analyze in this way is that of subsection 7.2 where the\nnoise vector B is parallel to V (junction circuit noise for the SQUID). V gives\nthe rotation rate of P in the z-y plane for a P started along the z-axis. Thus\nV \u2192 V + B with random B gives a spread of the orientation of the P increasing\nin time and so a decreasing length of the averaged P or decoherence according\nto\nZ t\nZ\nB(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 \u2248 cosB(0)t = cosBt P rob(B)dB\nP = cos\nt << tnoise (32)\n0\n\nwhere tnoise is the time scale over which B changes and P rob(B) is the probability distribution for the B. With a gaussian P rob(B) one obtains P =\n2 2\ne\u2212(1/2)B t . In general for small times one will expect P \u2248 1 \u2212 21 B 2 t2 .\n21\n\n\fOne sees that when t << tnoise the relevant quantity is the magnitude of\nthe fluctuations of B, namely B 2 . As is evident, for example, in the discussion\naround Eq 22, this is not the same as the P(\u03c9 = 0) entering into D. Rather B 2\nis given by the integral over P(\u03c9), Eq 22.\nIn Fig 9 we show the result of some simulations with very low frequency\nx-noise compard to a high frequency case.\n\nLength of the polarization vector\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n15000\n20000\nTime\nFigure 9: Simulations with low and high frequency x-noise compared. The\nupper curve shows the effect of a \"rectangular\" noise power spectrum with\ncutoff \u03c9c = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and the lower with \u03c9c = 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The low frequency case\n2\nexhibits the expected P \u223c e\u2212const.t behavior and the high frequency case the\n\u2212const.t\nP \u223ce\nbehavior of our main discussion. The dashed and dotted lines are\nfits for the two types of behavior.\n\nWe use a cut-off white noise spectrum similar to Eq 18. However to make\nthe situation with the noise frequencies completely clear we use a \"rectangular\"\nspectrum with P = 1 up to \u03c9c , where it is then abruptly cut off. The typical\ntime tnoise characterizing a change in a noise signal is then less than or on the\norder of \u03c9c . The upper curve is for the small \u03c9c = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 or tnoise > 5000. In\norder to make the effects evident the relatively large value \u03b4\u03b7 = 0.1 was used.\n2\nThe behavior P \u223c e\u2212const.t is seen and a fit (dashed line) gives 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22128 for\nthe constant. Using Eq 26 to find the effective B, and the integral over the power\nspectrum to find the variance, one predicts const. = (1/2)B 2 = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22128 , in\nreasonable agreement. The lower curve, on the other hand, is with the higher\nfrequency noise \u03c9c = 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 = 1/100. One observes the simple exponential\n22\n\n\fbehavior (dotted line), with the coefficient D = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 in approximate\nagreement with formula Eq 25 for D which gives D = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . That the low\nfrequency case has the smaller effective decoherence in this example is due to\nthe fact that with the \"rectangular\" noise spectrum and P fixed to one below\n\u03c9c , the variance B 2 decreases as \u03c9c decreases (Eq 22). While for the purposes\nof comparison we have kept P at \u03c9 = 0 constant for the two cases, the behavior\nunder experimental conditions will of course depend on the actual amplitude of\nthe low frequency noise.\nWe now turn to the perhaps more experimentally relevant situation of subsection 7.1 , as represented by Fig 3. While the V is still along the x-axis, the\nnoise is now along the z-axis, (\"flux noise\" in the SQUID ). P is again started\nalong the z-axis.\nThe noise perturbation along the z-axis leads to two differences with the\nx-noise case just discussed. One is \u221a\nthat the shifts in the rotation frequency are\n2\nnow quadratic in B. One has V \u2192 V 2 + B 2 \u2248 V + 12 BV . Thus the magnitude\nof the alteration of V is less than in the x-noise case, but will always have the\n1\nB2.\nsame sign, leading to an increase of the average frequency of rotation, by 2V\nThis average change is not relevant to the decoherence, but its fluctuations,\ncharacterized by B 4 \u2212(B 2 )2 , will play the role of the B fluctuations characterized\nby B 2 in the x-noise case.\nThe second difference has to do with the fact that since B is no longer\nparallel to V , the plane in which P rotates is tilted somewhat with respect\nto the y-z plane. This will lead to some oscillatory effects in the projections of\nP , but not to an increasing-with-time decoherence arising from the spread in\nrotation frequencies.\nWe thus again concentrate our attention on the spread in rotation frequencies. We repeat the arguments around Eq 32, with the role of B(t) now played\nby B 2 (t)/2V . Eq 32 now becomes\nP\n\nt\n\nB2 \u0001\nB 2 (t) \u0001 \u2032\n= cos\ndt \u2248 cos\nt =\n2V\n2V\n0\n\u0001\n1\n,\n= cos 21 arctan(\u03b1t)\n(1 + \u03b12 t2 )1/4\nZ\n\nZ\n\ncos\n\nB2 \u0001\nt P rob(B)dB\n2V\n\n(33)\n\nwhere we have taken a gaussian P rob(B) and \u03b1 = B 2 /V . For small t one has\nP \u2248 1 \u2212 (3/8)(B 2 /V )2 t2 . As before, B 2 is the relevant parameter of the noise,\nbut now it enters as (B 2 )2 since we are now concerned with the fluctuations of\nB 2 instead of those of B.\nIn Fig 10 we show z-noise simulations for P with a low, \u03c9c = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 and a\nhigher \u03c9c = 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 frequency rectangular noise spectrum. The \u03b4\u03b7 parameter\nof Eq 24 is 2.5\u00d710\u22123 . One notes the above-mentioned oscillations. The envelope\nto the upper curve (dashed curve) can be fit with Eq 33 using \u03b1 = 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nwhile the prediction with the parameters used is \u03b1 = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22125. Checks on the\ndependence of \u03b1 with respect to the magnitude and frequency of the noise signal\nare in agreement with the theory.

The lower curve is fit with a simple exponential.\n\nThe fact that the decoherence here depends on B 2 or the integral over P(\u03c9)\nleads to amusing consequences in the n=2,3 \"planckian noise\" cases, where the\nP(0) determining D is zero. As the temperature is lowered and B 2 becomes the\nrelevant quantity, the decoherence could increase. We find this is indeed the case\nin simulations, with the decoherence increasing substantially for temperature\nf ew \u00d7 10\u22123 , to above the D \u223c 10\u22124 level.\nA further interesting point to be noted is that in the general formalism the\nlength of P is always entropically decreasing (see Eq 17); while here, as in the\noscillations in Fig 10, P can in fact increase.\nIn general concerning very low frequency noise, we can conclude that there\nwill be a spread of oscillation frequencies or \"dephasing\" at times t << tnoise ,\nleading to a decoherence which is related to the variance of the noise signal B 2 ,\nas opposed to the integral over the autocorrelation function determining D. It\nappears in different ways according to the type of noise, as in our examples of\nx- or z- noise. While with high frequency noise the t << tnoise regime may\nbe unobservably small, with very low frequency noise it could dominate the\nrelaxation of P, as for the upper curve of Fig 9.\nIn this section we have retained the assumption of a small noise signal:\nB/V << 1 and treated a constant V. In the low frequency limit for the noise\n24\n\n\fit would also be possible to treat a large B, and a slowly moving V, using the\nadiabatic approximation, but this is beyond the scope of the present discussion.\n\n12\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have reviewed and extended the formulas relating random noise\nsignals and the decoherence parameter for the effective two level system formed\nby the lowest levels of a double potential well. The random noise is applied\nas a fluctuation of various parts of the full multi-level hamiltonian. Numerical\nsimulations verify the theoretical predictions, in which the relevant characteristic\nof the noise is the power at zero frequency. In particular different kinds of noise\nsignals are applied and we find reasonable agreement between the simulations\nand the analytic predictions.\nThis agreement includes the size of the decoherence parameter, as well as its\nindependence on the state of the system and on the frequency composition of\nthe noise. Effects related to the excitation of levels beyond those constituting\nthe two qubit-like states are discussed. The results confirm the possibility of\ndescribing the dynamics with an equation with a single decoherence constant D.\n\"Collapse of the Wavefunction\" behavior as well as that of the \"Watched Pot\nEffect\" are induced for large values of D. In general one finds that, within the\nallowable parameter ranges, the full complexity of the SU2 structure involving\nthe noise vectors, the V and the P arises from the two-state reduction of the\nfull hamiltonian. A particularly striking result, in agreement with the theory,\nis the small size or absence of decoherence when the noise signal has no power\nat zero frequency.\nThe noise power at zero frequency appears in fundamental treatments [16]\n[17] of the dissipation problem as the level of white noise. As is familiar from\nJohnson noise, for example, the existence of a classical dissipative parameter\nlike resistance is associated with a constant noise spectrum at low frequency.\nWe thus arrive at the perhaps obvious interpretation that to have a small D\nsuch classical dissipative effects or parameters should be kept to a minimum.\nAn interesting general question concerning our approach is to what extent\nclassical random noise can be used as an adequate simulation of decoherence.\nA real, classical signal, that is an unquantized [18] field, causes as many transitions 'up' as 'down' between any pair of states. This means that \"spontaneous\nemission\" or \"relaxation\", where, even in the absence of any noise, an upper\nlevel emits a quantum (e.g. a phonon, or in vacuum a photon) and transits\nto the lower state is absent. On the other hand, the neglect of spontaneous\nemission may not be important in practice. Quantum logic devices should have\nshort time scales of operation, while spontaneous emission rates will be slow.\nStudy of this question would require a detailed analysis for specific devices.\nWhile our main results are in the context of standard high frequency noise,\nwe also offer a short discussion and simulations of noise signals dominated by\nlow frequencies. It is found and verified by the simulations that in this case the\nrelevant parameter becomes the variance or integral over the power spectrum\n\n25\n\n\fof the noise.\n\n13\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the participation of A.

This would evidently be wrong, since it leads to\nno change in the energy splittings. The reason for this is that the evaluation of the matrix elements of the x2 operator goes beyond the two-state\nmodel, and involves the whole Hilbert space of the x variable. Our problem\n\n26\n\n\fprovides a nice example of how in an effective theory \u2013here the two-state\nhamiltonian Eq 2 \u2013 one obtains a simplification at the price of some unknown parameters, (e.g. matrix elements of x2 ) which are only determined\nin the more complete theory\u2013here the full hamiltonian Eq 1.\n[13] For recent discussions of dominant low frequency noise for SQUIDs see M.\nH. S. Amin and D. V. Averin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 197001 (2008) and\nR. Harris, M. W. Johnson, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 117003 (2008). It\nshould be noted that the transition rate formulas in these papers are those\nof the \"Turing\" or \"Watched Pot \" effect. That is, the rate is given by\nthe tunneling energy squared divided by the noise/decoherence parameter,\nas in our Eq 29. As explained in Ref [14] this arises as simply the solution\n2\nof our Eq 5 for large D: Pz \u2248 1 \u2212 (\u03c9tunnel\n/D)t. Since \u03c9tunnel in Harris,\nJohnson, et al. appears to be quite small the stabilization of the state could\nbe very strong. ( For simulations see Fig 6 of Ref [1]. ) Then sub-dominant\neffects, not necessarily related to the tunneling interaction, could induce\ntransitions. Thus an alternative explanation of the data of Harris, Johnson\net al. might be possible where the \"Watched Pot Effect\" keeps the system\nin the upper state long enough that a slow \"spontaneous emission\" to the\nground state can be observed. A test of this interpretation could be carried\nout by performing the procedure of Ref [8], namely a determination of D\nby means of an adiabatic sweep of xext through the \"resonance\" or \"level\ncrossing\".\n[14] R.A.
