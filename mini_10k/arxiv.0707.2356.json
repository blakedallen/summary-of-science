The single inclusive charged hadron pT spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC,\npredicted by a combined hydrodynamics+perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach are presented.\n\nWe present predictions for the inclusive transverse momentum distributions of pions, kaons\n\u221a\nand (anti)protons produced at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV based on\nhydrodynamics+pQCD calculations. The bulk of the spectra (pT . 5 GeV/c) in central Pb-Pb\nat the LHC is computed with a hydrodynamical model \u2013 successfully tested at RHIC [1]\n\u2013 using an initial entropy density extrapolated empirically from the hadron multiplicities\n\u221a\nmeasured at RHIC: dNch /d\u03b7|\u03b7=0 /(0.5 Npart ) \u2248 0.75 ln( sNN /1.5) [2]. Above pT \u2248 3 GeV/c,\nadditional hadron production from (mini)jet fragmentation is computed from collinearly\nfactorized pQCD cross sections at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy [3]. We use recent\nparton distribution functions (PDF) [4] and fragmentation functions (FF) [5], modified\nrespectively to account for initial-state shadowing [6] and final-state parton energy loss [7].\nWe use cylindrically symmetric boost-invariant 2+1-D relativistic hydrodynamics, fixing the\ninitial conditions for Pb-Pb at b = 0 fm and employing a simple Glauber prescription to obtain\nthe corresponding source profiles at all other centralities [1]. The initial source is assumed to\nbe formed at a time \u03c40 = 1/Q s \u2248 0.1 fm/c, with an initial entropy density of s0 = 1120 fm\u22123\n3\n(i.e. \u03b5o \u221d s4/3\n0 \u2248 650 GeV/fm ) so as to reproduce the expected final hadron multiplicity\ndNch /d\u03b7|\u03b7=0 \u2248 1300 at the LHC [2]. We follow the evolution of the system by solving the\nequations of ideal hydrodynamics including the current conservation for net-baryon number\n(the system is almost baryon-free, \u03bcB \u2248 5 MeV). For temperatures above (below) T crit \u2248 170\nMeV the system is described with a QGP (hadron gas) equation of state (EoS). The QGP EoS\n\u2013 obtained from a parametrization to recent lattice QCD results \u2013 is Maxwell connected to\nthe hadron resonance gas phase assuming a first-order phase transition. As done for RHIC\nenergies, we chemically freeze-out the system (i.e. fix the hadron ratios) at T crit . Final state\nhadron spectra are obtained with the Cooper-Frye prescription at T fo \u2248 120 MeV followed by\ndecays of unstable resonances using the known branching ratios. Details can be found at [1].\nOur NLO pQCD predictions are obtained with the code of ref. [3] with all scales set to\n\u03bc = pT . Pb-Pb yields are obtained scaling the NLO cross-sections by the number of incoherent\n\n\f\u221a\n\nIdentified hadron spectra in Pb-Pb at\n\nsNN = 5.5 TeV: hydrodynamics+pQCD predictions 2\n\nnucleon-nucleon collisions for each centrality class given by a Glauber model (Ncoll = 1670,\n12.9 for 0-10%-central and 60-90%-peripheral). Nuclear (isospin and shadowing) corrections\nof the CTEQ6.5M PDFs [4] are introduced using the NLO nDSg parametrization [6]. Finalstate energy loss in the hot and dense medium is accounted for by modifying the AKK FFs [5]\nwith BDMPS quenching weights as described in [7]. The BDMPS medium-induced gluon\nspectrum depends on a single scale \u03c9c = hq\u0302i L2 , related to the transport coefficient and length\nof the medium. We use \u03c9c \u2248 50 GeV, from the expected energy dependence of the quenching\nparameter and the measured \u03c9c \u2248 20 GeV at RHIC [7]. The inclusive hadron spectra in central\nPb-Pb are suppressed by up to a factor \u223c10 (2), RPbPb \u2248 0.1 (0.5), at pT = 10 (100) GeV/c.\n\n-\n\n+\n\ntotal (h +h )/2\n\n102\n\n+\n\n-\n\nhydro (h +h )/2\npions\n\n-\n\n+\n\nNLO pQCD (h +h )/2\nEloss (\u03c9 c = 50 GeV)\n\n1\n\n10-1\n10-2\n-3\n\n10\n\nkaons \u00d7 10-2\n\nPb-Pb @ 5.5 TeV [60-90% peripheral]\n\n1\n\ntotal (h +h )/2\nhydro (h +h )/2\npions\n\n+\n\n-\n\nNLO pQCD (h +h )/2\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n-3\n\n10\n\nkaons \u00d7 10-2\n\n10-4\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\np,p \u00d7 10\n\n-5\n\n10-7 p,p \u00d7 10\n\n10-7\n\n10\n\n10-8\n\n10-9\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n-\n\n+\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-\n\n+\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10-4\n10-5\n\n102\n\nT\n\n10\n\nd2N/(\u03c0 dp2dy) (GeV/c)-2\n\nPb-Pb @ 5.5 TeV [0-10% central]\n\n3\n\n10\n\nT\n\nd2N/(\u03c0 dp2dy) (GeV/c)-2\n\nOur predictions for the identified hadron spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.5 TeV are shown in\nFigure 1.
