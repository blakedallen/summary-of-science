In this work we study the ground state (GS) and magnetic excitations of two bipartite\nchains motivated by low-dimensional inorganic [1] and organic [2] ferrimagnets: the AB2 chain in Fig. 1(a) and the\nABC chain in Fig. 1(b), respectively. We shall use the simplest approach for interacting electron systems on a lattice\nwith N sites, namely the one-band Hubbard Model (HM):\nX\nX \u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 ,\n(1)\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + U\nH = \u2212t\ni\n\nhi,ji,\u03c3\n\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 (ci\u03c3 ) is the creation (annihilation) operator for electrons with spin \u03c3 at site i; t is the hopping parameter\nand U is the on site Coulomb repulsion. For the extremely localized regime (U \u226b t) and n \u2261 Ne /N = 1, where Ne is\nthe number of particles, the HM can be mapped onto the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model (AHM) [3]:\nH=\n\nJ X~ ~\nSi * Sj ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nhi,ji\n\nwhere J = 4t2 /U . We should mention that Mac\u00eado et al. [4], using a variety of numerical methods, have derived\nthe ferrimagnetic nature of AB2 chains modeled by the HM in the strong and weak coupling regimes. Here we focus\non the half-filled band case (n = 1) and extend these previous studies to much larger systems using Lanczos exact\ndiagonalization technique.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the two lattices present three electronic\u221abands in the tight-bindingp\nlimit (U = 0): one\nflat band at \u01eb = 0 for the two chains; and two dispersive ones, \u01eb(q) = \u00b12t 2 cos(q/2) and \u01eb(q) = \u00b1t 1 + [2 cos(q/2)]2 ,\nwith q = 2\u03c0l/(N/3) and l = 0...(N/3) \u2212 1 for the AB2 and ABC chains, respectively. The flat band is closely\nassociated with ferrimagnetic properties of both chains at half-filling [4, 5]. A particular feature of the AB2 chain is\na local invariance under the exchange of the B sites in any cell l [6]. The eigenvalues of the exchange operator being\npl = \u00b11. This symmetry leads to a conserved local spatial parity that in the Heisenberg limit asserts that the B\nsites form either a singlet (pl = 1) or a triplet (pl = \u22121) bond state. Therefore for the symmetry sector in which all\npl = \u22121 the spectrum is identical to that of the alternating spin- 21 /spin-1 AHM chain [6].\nII.\n\nFERRIMAGNETIC GROUND STATE\n\nA theorem due to Lieb and Mattis [7] asserts that the GS of the AHM on a bipartite lattice has total spin\nSg = |N1 \u2212 N2 |/2, where N1 and N2 are the number of lattice sites at the sub-lattices 1 and 2, respectively. So, if\n|N1 \u2212N2 | \u223c N the system display unsaturated ferromagnetic (F) GS. The coexistence of both F and antiferromagnetic\n(AF) long-range order implies in ferrimagnetism, as rigorously proved by Tian [8]. Another crucial step was provided\nby Lieb [9], who proved that the GS of the HM for n = 1 has Sg = |N1 \u2212 N2 |/2 for any U > 0. In this case, Tian and\ncollaborators [10] further established the ferrimagnetic (FERRI) long-range order of the GS if |N1 \u2212 N2 | \u223c N . The\nunit cell of the two chains of interest has 2 sites in one sublattice and 1 in the other (see Fig. 1), so that Sg = Nc /2,\nwhere Nc = N/3 is the number of unit cells. However, although ferrimagnetism is expected, the specific magnetic\nstructure of a unit cell may strongly depend on the Coulomb coupling, as well as on quantum fluctuations, and is not\nknown a priori from the more general results of the theorems stated above.\n\n\f2\nWe can probe the magnetic order through the Magnetic Structure Factor (MSF):\nS(q) =\n\n1 X iq(xi \u2212xj ) ~ ~\ne\nhSi * Sj i,\nN i,j\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is related to the zero-field static magnetic susceptibility by \u03c7(q = 0) = S(0)/(kB T ), where kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant and T is the temperature. The condition for a F (AF) ordered state is that S(0)[S(\u03c0)] \u223c N , so that in a\nlong-range FERRI GS the two conditions must be fulfilled. This is indeed the case for the two chains, as shown in\nFigs. 1 and 2, both in the strong and weak coupling limits.\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n(a)\n4\n\nS(0)\nS(\u03c0)\n\n2\n\nB1\n\n4\n\nS(q)\n\nA\n0\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n2\n\nNc\n\n0\n0\n\n0,5\n\nB2\n\n1\n\nq/\u03c0\n\n(b)\n\n4\n\nS(q)\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1,5\n\nS(0)\nS(\u03c0)\n\n2\n\nA B\n\n0\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n2\n\nNc\n\n0\n0\n\n0,5\n\nC\n\n1\n\nq/\u03c0\n\n2\n\n1,5\n\nFIG. 1: Magnetic Structure Factor S(q) for the AB2 (a) and ABC (b) chains in the Heisenberg limit (U \u226b t).

Dashed lines are guides for the eye.\n\nDue to the critical nature of both chains at low temperatures, the correlation length \u03be and \u03c7(q = 0) satisfy power\nlaw behaviour: \u03be \u223c T \u2212\u03bd and \u03c7 \u223c T \u2212\u03b3 as T \u2192 0. Since \u03be \u223c N at T = 0, using scaling arguments and the results\nof Fig. 1, we have T \u2212\u03b3 \u223c T \u2212\u03bd /T , i. e., \u03b3 \u2212 \u03bd = 1, in agreement with the values \u03b3 = 2 and \u03bd = 1 derived using\nrenormalization group techniques [11].\nIn Fig. 3 we present the local magnetization (Siz ) and the average local value of double occupancy (hni\u2191 ni\u2193 i) as\nfunction of U . Since the system has a spontaneously broken SU (2) symmetry, we can choose the spin sector S z = Sg\nto study these quantities, where S z is the total spin z component. In the Heisenberg limit (U \u226b t, hni\u2191 ni\u2193 i=0), the\nz\nz\nbulk magnetization estimated from chains up to Nc = 10 are: hSA\ni = \u22120.2925 and hSB\ni = 0.3962, for the AB2\n1,2\nz\nchain, in agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations [12] and with values for hSA\ni\n1\nz\nz\nz\nz\nand 2hSB1,2 i in the spin- 2 /spin-1 chain [13]. For the ABC chain, hSA i = \u22120.2567, hSB i = 0.3741 and hSC i = 0.3826.\n\n\f3\nNotice that a FERRI structure sustain quantum fluctuations, which strongly reduce the local magnetization from the\nclassical value, although in any case the unit cell magnetization remains 1/2. In the non-interacting limit (U = 0)\nz\nz\nz\nwe see in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) that hSA\ni = 0 and hSB\n+ SB\ni = 0.5 for the AB2 (ABC) chain. These results\n1 (B)\n2 (C)\nbeing related to the band structure: filling the bands up to n = 1 and choosing the spin sector S z = Sg , there exist\nNc unpaired electrons in the flat band which occupy B1 (B) and B2 (C) sites only. It is important to note that in this\nlimit the global GS does not have an unique value of S, but rather S \u2264 Nc /2. As the Coulomb coupling is turned on,\nthe GS, with a unique Sg = Nc /2, evolves adiabatically from the weak to the strong coupling regime (Fig. 3).\n\n0.3\n\nA\nB1,2\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nz\n\n<Si >\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n-0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0\n10 20 30 40\n\n0\n\n10 20 30 40\n\nA\nB1,2\n\n0,2\n\n<ni\u2191ni\u2193>\n\n0.4\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n0.2\n\n0,1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.3\n\nU/t\n\nU/t\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\nU/t\n\n20 0\n\n10\n\n0\n20\n\nU/t\n\nFIG. 3: Site magnetization hSiz i and average site double occupancy hni\u2191 ni\u2193 i as function of U for Nc = 5 in the AB2 and ABC\nchains in the spin sector S z = Sg . Dashed lines are guides for the eye.\n\nIII.\n\nMAGNETIC EXCITATIONS\n\nSystems with a FERRI GS naturally have F (lowering the GS spin) and AF (rising the GS spin) magnons as\ntheir elementary magnetic excitations. The two chains have three spin wave branches: an AF mode, defined as\n\u2206ES+ (q) = E(S z = Sg + 1, q) \u2212 E0 ; and two F ones, derived from \u2206ES\u2212 (q) = E(S z = Sg \u2212 1, q) \u2212 E0 , where E0 is the\nGS energy and E(S z , q) are lowest excitation energies in the sector {S z , q}, with q = 2\u03c0l/Nc and l = 0, 1, ..., Nc/2.\nThe acoustical and optical F modes are identified from symmetry considerations. These modes are depicted in Fig.\nIII for the two chains using the AHM: the AF mode has a gap, denoted by \u2206S+ ; the F1 mode is gapless, i. e., the\nGoldstone mode, consistent with the symmetry broken phase of the chains; the gap of the F2 mode is denoted by\n\u2206S\u2212 .\nFor the AB2 chain the gapped F2 branch is flat, Fig. III(a), and the other modes are dispersive. Since these\ndispersive modes preserve the local triplet bond, they are identical to those found in the spin- 21 /spin-1 [13] chain.\nSurprisingly, Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) [14] predicts that \u2206S\u2212 = 1, very close to our estimated value:\n\u2206S\u2212 = 1.0004J. Moreover, a good agreement is found for the gapless F1 branch in the long wave-length limit.\nHowever, both LSWT and mean field (MF) theory [15] predicts \u2206S+ = 1, deviating from our estimated exact\ndiagonalization value: \u2206S+ = 1.7591J, which is in excelent agreement with numerical and analytical calculations for\nthe spin- 21 /spin-1 chain [13]. On the other hand, the Interacting Spin Wave Theory [16] derives a better result for\n\u2206S+ , but it implies in a higher shift for \u2206S\u2212 (flat mode) not observed in our data of Fig. III(a). This flat mode\nindicates the localized nature of the excitation, which is associated with the formation of a singlet state (even parity\nsymmetry) between the B sites in one cell, while the other cells have odd parity symmetry (B sites in a triplet state).\nThus, since the symmetries of the F modes (dispersive and flat) are distinct, a possible level crossing is not avoided,\nas in fact observed in the data of Fig. III(a): for q & 0.75\u03c0 the localized excitation is below the dispersive one.\nFor the ABC chain we can see in Fig. III(b) that the three branches are dispersive. Like in the AB2 chain, the\nAF mode is gapped with \u2206S+ = 1.4189. The LSWT [17] conducts to a qualitative but not quantitative correct AF\nbranch. However, a good agreement is found for the gapless F1 mode in the long-wavelength limit. Moreover, the gap\nfor the F2 mode is estimated to be \u2206S\u2212 = 0.6778J. We can clearly observe in Fig. III(b) the level repulsion between\nthe F branches, which in this case have the same symmetry.\n\n\f4\n\n3\n2,5\n2\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\nAF\n\n1,5\n\n(b)\nAF\n\n1,5\n1\n\nF2\n\n1\n\nF2\n\n0,5\n\n0,5\n\nF1\n\nF1\n\n00\n\n1\n\n2\n\nq\n\n00\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\nq\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4: F and AF spin wave modes of the AB2 (a) and ABC (b) chains for Nc = 10 (circles), 8 (triangles down), 6 (triangles\nup).

In fact, it has been shown [18] that if f (s \u2212 m) = integer, a plateau may appear in\nthe magnetization curve of the AHM. In the last equation, s is the site total spin, m is the magnetization and f is the\nnumber of sites in one unit period of the GS for a given value of H. The Hamiltonians that we are considering here\nhave s = 1/2 and three sites per unit cell, so, unless the system spontaneously breaks the translation invariance (e.g.,\nby growing the unit cell), we expect a plateau at m = 1/6. This is indeed observed in Fig. 5 and its width matches\nexactly \u2206S+ , which measures the region of stability of the FERRI phase. For higher fields the magnetization increases\nin the expected way [18], as shown in the inset (2) of Figs. 5 (a) and 5 (b), before the magnetization saturates at\nm = 1/2 for H = 3J and H = 2.3660J, respectively. This field dependent behaviour contrasts with the linear one\npredicted by MF theory [15].\n\nm\n\n0,4\n\nNc=6\nNc=8\nNc=10\n\n0,5\n0,3 0,4\n(2)\n0,3\n0,2\n0,2 0,1\n0 1 2\n0\n1\n0,5\n\n0,5\n0,4\n0,3\n0,2\n0,1\n0\n0\n\n0,5\n\nNc=6 0,3 (1)\nNc=8 0,2\n0,1\nNc=10 0\n\n(1)\n0,4\n\n0,05\n1/N\n\nm\n\n0,5\n\n0,5\n0,3 0,4\n0,3\n0,2\n0,2 0,1\n0\n\n(a)\n3\n1,5\n\nH/J\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0,05\n1/N\n\n(2)\n(b)\n1\n0,5\n\n2\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\nH/J\n\nFIG. 5: Magnetization as function of the applied magnetic field H for the AB2 (a) and ABC (b) chains using the AHM. The\ninset (1) presents a finite size scaling study for m = 1/3; the inset (2) is a curve traced from the midpoints of the steps using\nthe finite size results, except at plateau regions.\n\nNow we turn to study the evolution of the AF and the F2 spin wave gaps as function of U using the HM: \u2206S+ (U )\n(plateau width) and \u2206S\u2212 (U ), respectively. In order to reduce finite size effects in calculating \u2206S\u00b1 (U ) we have used\nthe boundary condition that minimizes the gap between the GS and excited levels. Our estimated curves are depicted\nin Fig. 6 using the scaling ansatz [19] for extrapolation: \u2206 = \u2206\u221e + c1 N \u22122 + c2 N \u22124 , with N = 9, 12, 15 and 18 for the\nAB2 chain; N = 6, 9, 12 and 15 for the ABC chain. Note that \u2206S+ (U = 0) = 0 and 2t for the AB2 and ABC chains,\nrespectively. This can be understood by noticing that \u2206S+ (U = 0) is given by the gap between the two dispersive\n\n\f5\ntight-binding electronic bands. Moreover, \u2206S+ (U \u2192 0) \u223c U x , x \u2243 2, for the AB2 chain, whereas for the ABC chain\n\u2206S+ (U \u2192 0) increases linearly before reaching the tight-binding limit 2t. For both chains, we observe a crossover\nto the Heisenberg limit: \u2206S+ \u223c J, in agreement with the results of Fig. III. Further, we notice that \u2206S\u2212 (U \u2192 0)\nnullifies linearly with U , for both chains, following the behaviour of the gap between the flat electronic bands [4].\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n0,8\n\n0,2\n0\n0\n\n\u2206S+(U)\n1.4189J\n\u2206S-(U)\n0.6778J\n\n1,2\n\n0,6\n0,4\n\n(b)\n\n1,6\n\n0,8\n\n\u2206S+(U)\n1.7591J\n\u2206S-(U)\n1.0004J\n\n5\n\n0,4\n10\nU/t\n\n15\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nU/t\n\n15\n\nFIG. 6: Extrapolated AF (\u2206S+ ) and F2 (\u2206S\u2212 ) spin wave gaps in units of t for the AB2 (a) and ABC (b) chains as function\nof U using the HM.

These chains have experimental motivation in inorganic and organic ferrimagnetic\npolymers. We have focused on the description of their ferrimagnetic ground state properties and magnetic excitations.\nIn particular, we have revealed the non-trivial physical behaviour exhibited by these chains as function of the Coulomb\ncoupling strength.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge several useful discussion with A.
