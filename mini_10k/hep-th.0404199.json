Although experimental investigations, su h as\ninto quantum dots, require a more general des ription the theoreti al fo us has largely\nbeen on the integrable aspe ts of defe t systems. The defe t Yang Baxter equations (or\nRT relations), unitarity and defe t rossing unitarity relations were formulated in [1, 2\u2104,\nhowever no derivation of defe t rossing unitarity was presented, it was simply onje tured\nby analogy to the bulk theory. They showed the absen e of simultaneous transmission and\nre\u001de tion from an integrable defe t for theories with diagonal bulk s attering matri es,\nthis was generalized for non-diagonal theories with very general, even dynami al, defe ts\nin [3\u2104. An analysis of RT algebras [4, 5\u2104 and a proposal to avoid this `no go theorem'\nfor simultaneous transmission and re\u001de tion an be found in [6\u2104. Re ently a Lagrangian\ndes ription of integrable defe ts has been introdu ed in [7, 8\u2104, in luding a dis ussion on\nhow the boundary Lax pair approa h may be adapted for defe t systems. For a quantum\nme hani al treatment of the defe t problem we refer to [9\u2104, while for higher dimensional\nonformal defe ts to [10, 11, 12\u2104.\nIn this paper, by extending the `folding tri k' (formulated previously for free [13, 14\u2104\nor onformal [11, 15\u2104 theories), we show that any relativisti defe t theory, integrable or\nnot, an be des ribed as a ertain type of boundary theory. As a onsequen e previous\n1bajnok\bafavant.elte.hu\n2ag160\bgar\u001celd.elte.hu\n\n1\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n2\n\nresults developed for boundary theories, su h as perturbation theory, redu tion formulas,\nColeman-Thun me hanism and Cutkosky rules [16, 17\u2104, an be dire tly applied to defe ts.\nFor simpli ity we restri t the s ope of this letter to real relativisti s alar \u001celds in 1 + 1\ndimensions in order not to ompli ate the notations and on entrate on the prin ipal issues.\nSimilarly we restri t ourselves to strong, i.e. parity invariant, bulk theories. Generalizations\nof these results, to higher dimensions, or to more \u001celds are straightforward.\nBy applying the defe t-boundary orresponden e for integrable theories we an use the\nresults from integrable boundary theories, su h as the derivation of boundary rossing\nunitarity [18\u2104, the de\u001cnition of the boundary state, boundary bootstrap, et . for defe ts.\nSin e the defe t theory and the proposed boundary theories are equivalent we an use\nresults from the study of defe ts, su h as the no go theorem, to make statements about\nthe behaviour of these boundary theories. We show how one an onstru t solutions of\nthe boundary Yang-Baxter equation by bootstrapping on a known solution. We apply this\nmethod for purely transmitting impurity by applying the defe t-boundary orresponden e\nand obtain non-trivial solutions for any bulk theory. These solutions have a generi form\nand orrespond to parti les with imaginary rapidities `trapped' at the defe t. Finally\nwe use the defe t operator, obtained from the boundary state via the defe t-boundary\norresponden e, to perform a thermodynami Bethe ansatz al ulation of the ground state\nenergy of the system de\u001cned on the strip with defe ts.\n2.\n\nDefe t-boundary\n\norresponden e\n\nIf a \u001celd, \u03a6L , is restri ted onto left half line x \u2264 0 by a boundary lo ated at x = 0 the\nbulk and boundary intera tions are des ribed by the Lagrangian\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(\u2202t \u03a6L ) \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a6L ) \u2212 VL (\u03a6L ) \u2212 \u03b4(x)U(\u03a6L ) .\nL = \u0398(\u2212x)\n(1)\n2\n2\nHere the boundary potential U(\u03a6L ) is understood to only depend on the \u001celd through the\nvalue of the \u001celd at the boundary \u03a6L (0, t). The orresponding equation of motion and\nboundary ondition are\n\n\u2202VL\n\u2202U\n(2)\n; x\u22640,\n\u2202x \u03a6L (x, t)|x=0 = \u2212\n.\n\u2202\u03a6L\n\u2202\u03a6L\nThe Diri hlet boundary ondition an be des ribed either as a limit of the above one, or\nan be obtained dire tly from the Lagrangian with U = 0 but demanding \u03a6L (0, t) = \u03c6,\nwhere \u03c6 is a onstant.\nThe parity transform, P : x \u2194 \u2212x, of this theory is another theory, whi h lives on the\nright half line x \u2265 0. We all the original theory L and its parity transform R, whi h\nsatis\u001ces the equation of motion and boundary ondition\n(\u2212\u2202t2 + \u2202x2 )\u03a6L (x, t) =\n\n\u2202U\n\u2202VR\n; x\u22650,\n\u2202x \u03a6R (x, t)|x=0 =\n.\n(3)\n\u2202\u03a6R\n\u2202\u03a6R\nThe two theories are equivalent: VR = VL and the solutions of the two theories are onne ted\nby the parity transformation. Similarly the parity transform of the R theory is the L theory.\n(\u2212\u2202t2 + \u2202x2 )\u03a6R (x, t) =\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n3\n\nObserve that this is not a symmetry of one theory but merely two di\u001berent des riptions of\nthe same theory.\nThe quantum version of these theories are also equivalent, whi h an be seen as follows.\nThe quantum theories are de\u001cned following [16\u2104: The intera tion is supposed to swit hed\non adiabati ally in the remote past and swit hed o\u001b in the remote future. The asymptoti\nHilbert spa es are then the free Hilbert spa es and, being equivalent, are related by a unitary transformation alled the R-matrix. This matrix is onne ted to the Greens fun tions\nvia the boundary redu tion formula, and an be omputed in Lagrangian perturbation\ntheory.\nNow let us see how the identi\u001c ation of the two theories goes: The L theory has asymptoti `in ' states, |iniL , ontaining ni free parti les with real momentum ki > 0, (i.e.\ntraveling toward the boundary), lo ated at x = \u2212\u221e in the order of de reasing momentum,\nhighest momentum furthest to the left. The asymptoti `out ' states, |outiL , are omposed\nof nf free parti les with real momentum kf < 0, i.e. traveling away form the boundary,\nalso lo ated at x = \u2212\u221e in the order of in reasing momentum, most negative furthest to\nthe left. In the R theory the `in ' states, |iniR , ontain parti les with ki < 0, while `out '\nstates, |outiR , with momentum kf > 0, and both the parti les of the `in ' and `out ' states\nare lo ated at x = \u221e and ordered su h that the fastest moving parti les are furthest to the\nright. Clearly the parti les of both theories behave in the same way, \u001crst traveling towards\nthe boundary, then, after re\u001de ting, away from the boundary. The states of L and those\nof R are equivalent and are mapped to ea h other by the parity operator P , whi h does\nnothing but hanges the sign of the parti les momenta.\nThe R-matrix is a unitary operator whi h onne ts the asymptoti `in ' states to the\n`out ' states of ea h theories. They are written as RL and RR respe tively for L and R\nand both an be omputed from the orresponding boundary redu tion formulae. These\nformulae ontain the orrelation fun tions of the \u001celds \u03a6L and \u03a6R and an be omputed\nusing perturbation theory derived from (2) and (3), respe tively. Any term in the two\nperturbative expansions \u0015 and su h a way in the orrelation fun tions \u0015 are related by the\nparity operator, P , moreover the redu tion formulae are the parity transformed of ea h\nother. As a onsequen e the R-matri es are related by parity, P : RL \u2194 RR . Thus L and\nR are equivalent theories on the quantum level.\nDefe t theories are simply an L and a (possibly di\u001berent) R type theory onne ted at\nthe origin by the defe t, they an be des ribed by the Lagrangian\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n2\nL = \u0398(\u2212x)\n(\u2202t \u03a6L ) \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a6L ) \u2212 VL (\u03a6L )\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(\u2202t \u03a8R ) \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a8R ) \u2212 WR (\u03a8R ) \u2212 \u03b4(x)U(\u03a6L , \u03a8R ) .\n(4)\n+ \u0398(x)\n2\n2\nIf the \u001celds \u03a6L and \u03a8R are not the same then the equation of motion and boundary\nonditions for \u03a6L are given by (2) and those for \u03a8R by (3) with \u03a8R repla ing \u03a6R . Note\nthat, for a general defe t, there is no requirement that the values of the two \u001celds at the\ndefe t be the same. If the two \u001celds are in fa t the same we all the defe t system an\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n`impurity' system.

When there are signi\u001c ant di\u001beren es between how the\nimpurity and defe t theories need approa hing we will expli itly dis uss ea h separately.\nBy making a parity transformation on the R theory, \u03a8R \u2192 \u03a8L , we an equivalently\ndes ribe the defe t theory as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(\u2202t \u03a6L ) \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a6L ) \u2212 VL (\u03a6L )\nL = \u0398(\u2212x)\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n2\n+ \u0398(\u2212x)\n(\u2202t \u03a8L ) \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a8L ) \u2212 WL (\u03a8L ) \u2212 \u03b4(x)U(\u03a6L , \u03a8L ) .\n(8)\n2\n2\nThe equations of motion and boundary ondition for \u03a8L and \u03a8R are related like (2) and\n(3). The equation of motion and boundary ondition for \u03a6L remain un hanged. For an\nimpurity theory the same transformation an be made after it is written as a defe t theory\nas des ribed above. The boundary onditions be ome\n\u2202U\n;\n\u03a6L |x=0 = \u03a8L |x=0 =: \u03c60 .\n\u2202x \u03a8L |x=0 + \u2202x \u03a6L |x=0 = \u2212\n(9)\n\u2202\u03c60\nThe Lagrangian (8) des ribes a boundary \u001celd theory with two self intera ting \u001celds, ea h\nrestri ted to the left half line, these \u001celds only intera t with ea h other at the boundary.\nThe two theories (4) and (8) are lassi ally equivalent, the solutions an be mapped to\nea h other by a ting on one \u001celd with the parity operator P : \u03a8L \u2194 \u03a8R .\nThey are also equivalent at the quantum level, whi h an be seen similarly to the previous\nase by de\u001cning them in the framework of [16\u2104. The `in ' states in the defe t theory onsist\nof L type parti les, belonging to \u001celd \u03a6L , with ki > 0 approa hing the defe t from the\nleft and R parti les, belonging to \u001celd \u03a8R , with ki < 0 approa hing from the right, as\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n5\n\nbefore the order of these parti les is su h that the fastest moving parti les are furthest\nfrom the defe t. The `in ' state an be written as |iniL \u2295 |iniR . In the `out ' state we have L\nand R parti les traveling away from the defe t with kf < 0 and kf > 0, and ea h on their\nrespe tive sides of the defe t, and ordered as before. This an be written as |outiL \u2295 |outiR .\nThere exists a unitary operator whi h onne ts the `out ' and `in ' asymptoti states,\nalled the RT -matrix. The (LL) element of this matrix is the re\u001de tion matrix RL whi h\ngives the amplitudes for pro ess onne ting |iniL with |outiL. Similarly the (RR) element\nis the re\u001de tion matrix RR whi h gives the amplitudes of pro esses onne ting |iniR with\n|outiR . The (LR) element is the transition matrix TL onne ting |iniL with |outiR and the\n(RL) element is the transition matrix TR onne ting |iniR with |outiL.\nThe adiabati des ription of (8) has `in ' states whi h ontains parti les with momentum\nki < 0 of both types \u03a6L and \u03a8L , approa hing the boundary from x = \u2212\u221e with the usual\nordering. These states an be written as |ini\u03a6 \u2295 |ini\u03a8 . The `out ' states have the same type\nof parti les but with kf < 0, with the same ordering and written as |outi\u03a6 \u2295 |outi\u03a8 . We\nhave the usual R-matrix, R, whi h onne ts the `in ' and `out ' states. It has four elements\nthe (\u03a6\u03a6) and (\u03a8\u03a8) elements onne t the |ini\u03a6 states to |outi\u03a6 and |ini\u03a8 to |outi\u03a8 states,\nrespe tively, and are denoted R\u03a6\u03a6 and R\u03a8\u03a8 . The (\u03a6\u03a8) and (\u03a8\u03a6) elements, denoted R\u03a6\u03a8\nand R\u03a8\u03a6 , respe tively give the amplitudes of pro esses onne ting |ini\u03a6 with |outi\u03a8 and\n|ini\u03a8 to |outi\u03a6 . We an de\u001cne a parity operator that a ts on one of the \u001celds of the\nboundary system only, P\u03a8 : \u03a8L \u2194 \u03a8R , but leaves the \u03a6 \u001celd un hanged. This operator\nmaps the asymptoti states of the defe t and of the boundary theory to ea h other. To\nsee how the R and RT matri es are related one has to relate them to the orresponding\norrelation fun tions via the redu tion formula, whi h \u001cnally has to be omputed from\nthe Lagrangian. Analyzing the a tion of the parity operator at ea h step we obtain the\nfollowing identi\u001c ations:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nR\u03a6\u03a6 R\u03a8\u03a6\nRL TR\nP\u03a8 : R =\n\u2194 RT =\n(10)\nR\u03a6\u03a8 R\u03a8\u03a8\nTL RR\nNow we an exploit this orresponden e. All that we have learned already for boundary\ntheories an be applied straightforwardly to defe t theories: we an present perturbation theory, redu tion formulas and in the view of [17\u2104, the derivation of Coleman-Thun\nme hanism and Cutkosky rules for defe t theories is also straightforward. Note that the\ngeneralization for higher dimensions with a odimension 1 defe t is obvious, just as is\nthe a ommodation of more \u001celds. Also \u2202t \u03a6 and \u2202t \u03a8 dependent potentials or boundary\nonditions that relate \u03a6, \u2202x \u03a6 linearly to \u03a8, \u2202x \u03a8 an be in orporated.\n3.\n\nIntegrable aspe ts,\n\nonsequen es\n\nWe will now fo us on the integrable aspe ts of the orresponden e between defe ts and\nboundaries. Classi al integrability in the presen e of boundaries has been the subje t of\nseveral years of study. All the methods developed for boundary integrable systems are now\navailable for the study of integrable defe t or impurity theories. For example Skylanin's\nformalism [19\u2104 whi h allows the onstru tion of the onserved harges for the boundary\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n6\n\n\u001celd, and an be used to \u001cnd the integrable boundary onditions [20\u2104 an now be used on\ndefe t or impurity systems. The Lax pair for defe t systems is dis ussed in [7, 8\u2104 and is\nequivalent to the boundary Lax pair approa h des ribed in [21\u2104.\nAt the quantum level the existen e of in\u001cnitely many onserved harges give severe\nrestri tion on the allowed pro esses. As a onsequen e the R-matrix of a boundary system\nan be de omposed into a produ t of two parti le S -matri es and one parti le R-matri es.\nThe former entirely des ribes the s attering of two parti les in the bulk of the \u001celd, the\nlatter des ribes the re\u001de ting of a single parti le from the boundary. Similarly for defe t\nsystems the RT -matrix an be de omposed into a produ t of the, possibly di\u001berent, two\nparti le S -matri es of the two \u001celds either side of the defe t and one parti le RT -matri es\ndes ribing the re\u001de tion and transmission of individual parti les through the defe t. The\nintegrable one parti le R-matrix and RT -matrix depend on the parti le energy through\nthe absolute value of the rapidity, \u03b8, of the in ident parti le. The two parti le S -matri es\ndepend on the absolute value of the di\u001beren e between the rapidities of the s attering\nparti les. The asymptoti states of the integrable boundary and defe t systems have the\nsame des ription as in the non-integrable ases, with the additional ondition that, in both\nases, the number of parti les in the `out ' state must be the same as the number of parti les\nin the `in ' state and the onserved harges of the two asymptoti states must oin ide. The\nintegrable R and RT -matri es are unitarity operators whi h map one parti le `in ' states\nto one parti le `out ' states and are related as des ribed in (10).\nThe integrable defe t theory has two S -matri es, SL and SR , respe tively des ribing\nthe two parti le s attering in the L and R \u001celds. The integrable boundary theory has a\nsingle S -matrix des ribing the two parti le s attering of the bulk \u001celd. If the bulk \u001celd is\nomposed of two nonintera ting \u001celds, \u03a6 and \u03a8, as in the ase des ribed as equivalent to a\ndefe t theory, then the S -matrix, S, has a blo k diagonal form with diagonal elements S\u03a6\u03a6 ,\nS\u03a6\u03a8 , S\u03a8\u03a6 and S\u03a8\u03a8 . The element S\u03a6\u03a6 des ribes the s attering of two parti les both of the\n\u001celd \u03a6, similarly S\u03a8\u03a8 des ribes the s attering of two parti les of \u001celd \u03a8, S\u03a6\u03a8 and S\u03a8\u03a6 both\ndes ribe the s attering between two parti les where one belongs to ea h of the separate\n\u001celds \u03a6 and \u03a8. Sin e these S -matri es an be omputed from the bulk Lagrangian, (where\nthe \u03a6 and \u03a8 parti les intera t only with themselves) we know, that\n\nS\u03a8\u03a6 = S\u03a6\u03a8 = 1 ;\n\nS\u03a6\u03a6 \u2261 SL\n\n;\n\nS\u03a8\u03a8 \u2261 SR\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\n(A S -matrix of a di\u001berent form has been used in [22, 23\u2104 to des ribe an integrable defe t\nof a non-relativisti theory.)\nFa torizability of the defe t system gives the defe t Yang-Baxter, or re\u001de tion transmission equations, whi h was des ribed by several authors [1, 2, 3, 6\u2104.

Now we an produ e\nanother solution, for an ex ited boundary, via the boundary bootstrap equation [18\u2104\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\nc\n\nc\n\nf\ne\n\n\u03b8\n\nb\n\niu \u03b2\n\ng\nd\n\n\u03b8\n\nb\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\niu\n\na\n\n\u03b1\na\n\n\u03b2\nga\u03b1\nRc\u03b3\nb\u03b2 (\u03b8)\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\nde\ngg\u03b2\nSab\n(\u03b8 \u2212 iu)Rfe\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b8)Sfegd (\u03b8 + iu) .\n\n(17)\n\nRc\u03b3\nb\u03b2 (\u03b8),\n\nThis new solution,\nautomati ally satis\u001ces the required equations. The proof of\nthe boundary Yang-Baxter equation or fa torization an be shown \u001crst by `shifting' the\ntraje tories from the ex ited boundary to the ground state boundary, then using the proof\non this boundary and shifting ba k to the ex ited boundary. The unitarity and boundary\nrossing unitarity is a onsequen e of the similar equations for the bulk S -matrix. If the\noriginal R-matrix does not have any pole in the physi al strip we an always add a CDD\nfa tor to ensure its existen e. By applying the folding method to transmitting defe t\nsystems as des ribed in this letter we an apply this method to \u001cnd non-trivial solutions\nof defe t systems.\nFor example let us assume that S\u03a6\u03a6 and S\u03a8\u03a8 are parity transforms of ea h other\ndc\nS\u03a6\u03a6 cd\nab (\u03b8) = S\u03a8\u03a8 ba (\u03b8). In this ase the solution R\u03a6\u03a8 = R\u03a8\u03a6 = 1, whi h orresponds to\ntrivial transmission, satis\u001ces all the required equations. By adding a CDD fa tor to this\nsolution without spoiling its ni e properties we an ensure the existen e of a pole at \u03b8 = iu,\n0 < u < \u03c0/2. Let us label this unex ited boundary solution by 0 = \u03b1. Now if a parti le\nwith label a is bound to the boundary the ex ited boundary state will have label a = \u03b2 .\nA parti le of type b an re\u001de t from the boundary to parti le c by hanging the boundary\nstate from a to \u03b3 = d as shown on the previous \u001cgure. By using (17) we an \u001cnd an expression for the re\u001de tion matrix for this ex ited boundary. The R-matrix for the ex ited\nboundary now depends upon the spe ies of re\u001de ting parti le,\ncd\ncd\nR\u03a6\u03a8 cd\nba (\u03b8) = TL ba = S\u03a6\u03a6 ab (\u03b8 \u2212 iu) ;\n\ncd\ndc\nR\u03a8\u03a6 cd\nba (\u03b8) = TR ba = S\u03a8\u03a8 ba (\u03b8 + iu) .\n\n(18)\n\nClearly they satisfy (12), sin e the bulk S -matrix satis\u001ces the bulk Yang-Baxter equation.\nThey also satisfy the unitarity and ross unitarity relations sin e it redu es to the analogous\nequations of the bulk S -matrix. Observe that equation (12) is similar to the Lax equations\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n10\n\nof integrable latti e models and so the bulk S matrix always solves it. If u = 0 the solution\ndes ribes a standing parti le. Bootstrapping further on this ex ited defe t we an bind\neither di\u001berent type, or more parti les to the defe t. It is similar to how one an \u001cnd\nhigher spin solutions of the Lax equation in latti e models.\nWe note that another spe ial solution for purely transmitting impurity is found by Konik\nand LeClair, for the sine-Gordon model using the perturbed CFT approa h [24\u2104.\nPurely transmitting defe ts are of parti ular interest in the study of boundary systems\nas they may be used to onstru t new solutions to the re\u001de tion equation. If there exists\nb\u03b2\na TL b\u03b2\na\u03b1 (\u03b8) and TR a\u03b1 (\u03b8) whi h satis\u001ces the transmission equation (12), unitarity (14) and\ncd\nrossing unitarity (15) for some S -matrix, Sab\n(\u03b8), and a R0 b\u03b2\na\u03b1 (\u03b8) that satis\u001ces the re\u001de tion\nequation (13) for the same S -matrix then the matrix\nb\u03b21\nc\u03b31\nd\u03b22\nR1 b\u03b2\na\u03b1 (\u03b8) = TL a\u03b11 (\u03b8)R0 c\u03b12 (\u03b8)TR d\u03b31 (\u2212\u03b8) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12 and \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u2297 \u03b22 , also satis\u001ces the re\u001de tion equation [25\u2104.

If R1 is blo k\ndiagonal in the \u03b1, \u03b2 basis then the R-matrix an be proje ted into one of the irredu ible\nblo ks, the defe t is then said to be fused to the boundary. Solutions developed in this\nmanner, using (18), are equivalent to performing the boundary bootstrap pro edure.\n5.\n\nAppli ation: defe t TBA\n\nLet us now onsider one appli ation of the boundary-defe t orresponden e developed\nin this paper; suppose we would like to al ulate the groundstate energy of an integrable\nsystem, ontaining one parti le type with mass m, and bulk s attering matrix S , in a\n\u001cnite geometry.

We an interpret the result as follows; sin e nothing depends on the position of the\ndefe ts we an move them all to either of the boundaries. Now we do not have any defe t,\nbut the boundary is dressed, and what we an see in the \u001cnal result is nothing but the\ndressed re\u001de tion fa tors.\n6.\n\nCon lusion\n\nUsing the folding tri k we have shown that defe t theories are equivalent to ertain\nboundary theories. As a onsequen e we an take results from boundary \u001celd theory, su h\nas redu tion formulas, Coleman-Thun me hanism, Cut osky rules.\nApplying this folding tri k to integrable systems the defe t rossing unitarity and defe t\noperator were derived, and the fusion method was used for \u001cnding solutions to general\nimpurity systems. The defe t operator is used to al ulate the groundstate energy of an\nintegrable system de\u001cned on the interval with defe ts. Sin e the result does not depend\non the lo ation of the defe ts, defe ts an be fused to any of the boundaries obtaining a\nsystem without defe ts but with dressed re\u001de tion matri es.\nThis idea an be used in a theory with non-diagonal boundary s attering as follows.\nSuppose we an write the non-diagonal re\u001de tion fa tor as a diagonal one fused with a\nnon-diagonal defe t. Now moving this non-diagonal defe t to the other boundary and\nfusing with it the fused re\u001de tion fa tor may be diagonal helping in the solution of the\nmodel.\n\n\fFROM DEFECTS TO BOUNDARIES\n\n13\n\nThe authors would like to thank L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Palla, G\u00e1bor Tak\u00e1 s, Gustav\nDelius, Atsushi Higu hi and Peter Bow o k for interesting and helpful dis ussions.
