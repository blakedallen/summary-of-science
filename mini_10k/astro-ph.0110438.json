This contribution reviews the properties of nuclear activity\nin nearby galaxies, with emphasis on results obtained from current optical\nsurveys and multiwavelength follow-up observations thereof.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a meeting which celebrates different techniques of surveying AGNs, it is appropriate to remind ourselves of the properties of the AGN population in nearby\ngalaxies. Nearby AGNs are important for at least two reasons. First, they inform\nus of the faint end of the local (z \u2248 0) AGN luminosity function, a fundamental constraint on a variety of statistical considerations of the AGN population.\nSecond, as the evolutionary endpoints of quasars, they present an opportunity\nto study black hole accretion in a unique regime of parameter space. This paper limits itself to three topics. Section 2 summarizes some general statistics\nresulting from optical searches for nearby AGNs. The interpretation of these results largely hinges on our understanding of the physical origin of low-ionization\nnuclear emission-line regions (LINERs; Heckman 1980), which is the subject\nof Section 3. Finally, Section 4 draws some inferences on the demographics of\nmassive black holes.\n2.\n\nStatistics of Nearby AGNs from the Palomar Survey\n\nMost AGN surveys rely on selection criteria that isolate some previously known\ncharacteristics of these objects. Common strategies to find quasars, for example,\nemploy color cuts to highlight the UV excess typically present in AGN spectra,\nor objective prism plates to identify objects with strong emission lines. Other\nwavelength-specific techniques to find candidate AGNs include combing areas of\nthe sky in the radio or X-rays. Infrared-based methods use temperature selection to cull sources \"warmer\" than might be expected for star-forming galaxies.\nWhile all of these techniques have been successful, each introduces biases specific\nto the wavelength. And all require follow-up optical spectroscopy to confirm the\nAGN identification, to classify its type, and to determine its redshift.\nA more direct, less biased approach is to spectroscopically survey every\nobject within a particular region of the sky to a given optical magnitude limit.\nThis, of course, is an expensive route, and in practice one is confined to go deep\nover only a small solid angle or stay relatively shallow over a wider area. In\naddition, when covering a wide area, a morphological cut has to be made so\nthat one does not waste a lot of time observing foreground stars.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHo\n\nFig. 1. Detection rate of\nAGNs as a function of Hubble type in the Palomar survey. \"Type 1\" AGNs (those\nwith broad H\u03b1) are shown separately from the total population (types 1 and 2). Adapted\nfrom Ho et al. (1997b).\nThe results presented in the rest of this paper stem from the the Palomar\noptical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (Filippenko & Sargent 1985; Ho,\nFilippenko & Sargent 1995). In brief, the Palomar 200-inch telescope was employed to take moderate-dispersion, high-quality spectra of 486 bright (BT \u2264\n12.5 mag), northern (\u03b4 > 0\u25e6 ) galaxies, with the primary aim of conducting an\naccurate census of the AGN population in the nearby (z \u2248 0) universe. The\nPalomar survey, the most sensitive of its kind (see Ho 1996 for a comparison\nwith previous optical studies), produced a comprehensive, homogeneous catalog\nof spectral classifications of nearby galaxies (Ho et al. 1997a, 1997b, 1997c).\nThe main results of the survey are the following. (1) AGNs are very common in\nnearby galaxies (Fig. 1). At least 40% of all galaxies brighter than BT = 12.5\nmag emit AGN-like spectra. The emission-line nuclei are classified as Seyferts,\nLINERs, or transition objects (LINER/H II), and most have very low luminosities compared to traditionally studied AGNs. The luminosities of the H\u03b1\nemission line range from 1037 to 1041 erg s\u22121 , with a median value of \u223c1039 erg\ns\u22121 . (2) The detectability of AGNs depends strongly on the morphological type\nof the galaxy, being most common in early-type systems (E\u2013Sbc). The detection\nrate of AGNs reaches 50%\u201375% in ellipticals, lenticulars, and bulge-dominated\nspirals but drops to <20%\nin galaxies classified as Sc or later. (3) LINERs make\n\u223c\nup the bulk (2/3) of the AGN population and a sizable fraction (1/3) of all\ngalaxies. (4) A significant number of objects show a faint, broad (FWHM \u2248\n1000\u20134000 km s\u22121 ) H\u03b1 emission line that qualitatively resembles emission arising from the conventional broad-line region of \"classical\" Seyfert 1 nuclei and\nquasars.\n3.\n\nThe Nature of LINERs1\n\nIf LINERs are powered by a nonstellar central source, then they clearly would\nbe the most abundant type of AGNs in nearby galaxies. However, ever since\ntheir discovery, the physical origin of LINERs has been controversial. The AGN\n\n1\n\nNote that this paper is concerned only with compact, nuclear LINERs (r <\n\u223c 200 pc), which\nare most relevant to the AGN issue. LINER-like spectra are often also observed in extended\nnebulae such as those associated with cooling flows, nuclear outflows, and circumnuclear disks.\n\n\fThe Population of AGNs in Nearby Galaxies\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Double-peaked\nbroad H\u03b1 lines detected in STIS spectra\nof NGC 4203 (Shields\net al. 2000) and NGC\n4450 (Ho et al. 2000).\ninterpretation for LINERs is only one of several possible explanations, as recently\nreviewed by Barth (2001). The most uncertain subset are the type 2 LINERs\nand transition objects, whose energetics may arise, at least in part, from stellar\nprocesses.\nHo (1999a) used several lines of evidence to argue that a significant fraction\nof LINERs are genuine AGNs. Some of these are repeated below, along with\nupdated information when available.\n(1) The host galaxies of LINERs are similar to those of Seyfert nuclei. Both\nclasses reside in bulge-dominated hosts (E\u2013Sbc), quite distinctive from starforming H II nuclei, which are found mainly in Hubble types Sc and later. To\nthe extent that bulges invariably contain massive black holes (e.g., Magorrian\net al. 1998; Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001; R. Green, these proceedings), this is\nconsistent with the idea that LINERs are associated with accretion processes.\n(2) Some of the best candidates for massive black holes are in LINER galaxies.\nWell-known examples include M81, M84, M87, and the Sombrero galaxy. The\nrapidly growing list of objects with kinematically determined black hole masses\n(see, e.g., Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001; Ho 2001b) continues to support this.\n(3) LINERs contain broad-line regions. The Palomar survey discovered that\n15%\u201325% of the LINER population are \"type 1\" LINERs - LINERs with a directly visible broad component of H\u03b1 emission (Ho et al. 1997c). The broad-line\ncomponent, however, is generally rather weak; the measurement is extremely\nchallenging, requiring careful subtraction of the underlying starlight and deblending of complex line profiles. The robustness of the broad H\u03b1 detections,\ntherefore, remained to be evaluated by independent observations. Rix et al.\n(2002) recently used STIS on HST to obtain nuclear spectra of a statistically\ncomplete subsample of emission-line nuclei selected from the original Palomar\nsurvey. The small aperture (0.\u2032\u2032 2) used in these observations excludes\n\n\f4\n\nHo\n\nFig. 3. (Left) NICMOS/HST H-band central surface brightness profile of NGC\n1052.

Adapted from Ho & Peng (2001).\nmost of the contaminating bulge light and enables a much more straightforward\nassessment of the presence of broad lines. These data, and other related observations using HST, have shown that the statistics of broad H\u03b1 emission derived\nfrom the Palomar survey are essentially robust (Rix et al. 2002).\nHowever, the HST spectra revealed that in some objects (Fig. 2) the broad\nline does show a qualitative difference in the form of a double-peaked, asymmetric profile, highly reminiscent of similar structures found in some broad-line\nradio galaxies that are commonly interpreted as signatures of a relativistic accretion disk (e.g., Chen, Halpern, & Filippenko 1989). Double-peaked broad\nlines are supposed to be quite rare; according to Eracleous & Halpern (1994),\nthey are seen in only 10% of radio-loud AGNs (\u223c1% of all bright AGNs). Given\nthe relatively high detection frequency of these objects in serendipitous HST\nobservations (M81: Bower et al. 1996; NGC 4203: Shields et al. 2000; NGC\n4450: Ho et al. 2000; NGC 4579: Barth et al. 2001), we suspect that this\nphenomenon is much more common than previously thought. Indeed, Ho et al.\n(2000) discuss how double-peaked broad lines might arise naturally in nearby\nnuclei with low-accreting black holes.\n(4) Compact nuclei are common in LINERs. But they are not easy to measure.\nEmission from the host galaxy invariably swamps the nuclear component. The\ncontrast problem is not as severe at some wavelengths compared to others (e.g.,\nUV), but generally it never goes away. In order to reliably quantify the nuclear\nfluxes from these sources, one needs observations not only with good sensitivity\nbut also high angular resolution. The second point is crucial: generally angular\n\u2032\u2032\nresolutions of <1\n\u223c are necessary to unambiguously disentable a tiny central core\n\n\fThe Population of AGNs in Nearby Galaxies\n\n5\n\nembedded in a bright bulge. The requisite data, although in principle not that\nchallenging to obtain with modern facilities, have been subject to systematic\nanalysis only quite recently.\nFigure 3 illustrates the practical challenge. The left panel shows the central\nsurface brightness profile of the well-studied LINER NGC 1052 measured in the\nH band with NICMOS on HST (Ravindranath et al. 2001). The central point\n\u2032\u2032\nsource is faint, but quite well defined at r <\n\u223c 0. 1. It almost certainly would\nhave escaped notice in typical ground-based images. Even with HST resolution, however, note that it is not trivial to extract the point-source magnitude\nunambiguously in the presence of a cuspy bulge profile. The right panel in\nthe figure generalizes this problem to a well-defined sample of nearby Seyfert\n1 galaxies recently studied by Ho & Peng (2001). It shows that although the\ncontrast problem is most acute in LINERs, it is nonetheless quite important as\nwell in Seyfert galaxies. The top panel, which plots the integrated optical (B)\nabsolute magnitudes of the entire galaxy, gives the familiar result that Seyfert\ngalaxies typically have MB \u2248 \u221221 mag, roughly corresponding to L\u2217 (e.g., Ho\net al. 1997b). On the other hand, the true magnitude of the Seyfert nucleus\n- the quantity most pertinent to the AGN phenomenon and most analogous\nto observations of quasars - ranges from MB \u2248 \u221221 to \u22129, a factor up to 105\nfainter than the integrated luminosity. Clearly, any quantitative discussion of\nthe physical properties of low-luminosity AGNs, be they LINERs or Seyferts,\nwould be meaningless if this were not taken into account.\nThe incidence of compact nuclei in LINER galaxies depends on wavelength,\nbut in general the detection rate is quite high, on the order of 50% or greater.\nThe most robust statistics come from radio and X-ray observations, since these\nbands are least affected by dust obscuration.\nSeveral recent studies have exploited the high angular resolution of the VLA\nto search for compact radio cores in the Palomar galaxies (Van Dyk & Ho 1998;\nNagar et al. 2000; Filho, Barthel, & Ho 2000; Ho & Ulvestad 2001). The\nVLA can deliver fairly sensitive (rms \u223c 50\u2013100 \u03bcJy) radio continuum images\nefficiently in \"snapshot\" mode. In general the observations have been done at 6,\n3.6, or 2 cm, with resolutions of \u223c1\u2032\u2032 . The main results are: (a) compact cores\nare quite common, being present in \u223c50%\u201380% of the objects; (b) they are weak,\ntypically P6cm \u2248 1018 \u2212 1021 W Hz\u22121 ; (c) a sizable fraction of them have flat or\neven inverted spectra; and (d) they have relatively simple structures, usually well\ndescribed by a single unresolved core. Many sources remain unresolved when\nexamined at milli-arcsecond resolution using VLBI techniques (e.g., Wrobel,\nFassnacht, & Ho 2001; Filho, Barthel, & Ho 2001; Ulvestad & Ho 2002, in\npreparation), although some show jetlike linear extensions (Falcke et al. 2000).\nThe Palomar galaxies have also been the subject of intense scrutiny in the\nX-rays, both in the soft-energy band using ROSAT (Komossa, B\u00f6hringer, &\nHuchra 1999; Roberts & Warwick 2000; Halderson et al. 2001) and in the hardenergy band using ASCA (Terashima, Ho, & Ptak 2000; Terashima et al. 2001).\nThe coarse angular resolution of these satellites, however, severely limits one's\nability to reliably measure the weak signal from the nucleus. This is the domain\nof Chandra. A large, well-defined subsample of the Palomar galaxies is currently\nbeing imaged with ACIS. The preliminary findings, reported by Ho et al. (2001),\nsuggest that compact X-ray sources astrometrically coincident with the radio\n\n\f6\n\nHo\n\nFig. 4.

They are detected universally in type 1 LINERs\nand Seyferts, relatively often in type 2 LINERs and Seyferts, but very rarely in\ntransition nuclei. These statistics need to be verified with the full sample, which\nis forthcoming (Ho et al. 2002, in preparation).\n(5) LINERs are highly sub-Eddington systems. Recent advances in black hole\nmass determinations in nearby galaxies gives us an opportunity to compare the\nnuclear luminosities described above with the corresponding Eddington luminosities. Ho (2002, in preparation) estimated nuclear bolometric luminosities\nfor \u223c100 Palomar galaxies based on X-ray measurements. As shown in Fig42\n\u22121\nure 4a, the majority of the objects have Lbol <\n\u223c 10 erg s , with the interesting\ntrend that Seyferts are systematically more luminous than LINERs (including\ntransition objects), which in turn are brighter than absorption-line nuclei (objects with no nuclear optical emission lines). More revealing still is the trend\nwith \u03bb \u2261 Lbol /LEdd (Fig. 4b). The distributions of \u03bb systematically shift to\nlower values following the sequence S \u2192 L+T \u2192 A. Although LINERs and\n\u22123\nSeyferts broadly overlap, note that all LINERs are characterized by \u03bb <\n\u223c 10 .\n(6) The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are peculiar. Specifically, the SEDs\ngenerically lack the optical-UV \"big blue bump\" (Ho 1999b; Ho et al. 2000), a\nnear-universal feature of unobscured high-luminosity AGNs usually attributed\nto thermal emission from an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.\nAnother attribute of the SEDs of low-luminosity AGNs, especially of LINERs,\nis that they are typically \"radio loud,\" defined here by the convention that the\nradio-to-optical luminosity ratio exceed some fiducial value, say R > 10, as\nnormally adopted in quasar studies. In fact, Ho (2001b) finds that among the\n\u223c40 nearby galaxies with kinematically determined black hole masses, essentially\n\n\fThe Population of AGNs in Nearby Galaxies\n\n7\n\nFig.\n5.\nDistribution\nof the nuclear radio-tooptical luminosity ratio R\u2032\nvs. \u03bb \u2261 Lbol /LEdd .

Since many of these objects are spiral galaxies, this\nresult challenges the conventional wisdom that radio loudness is an attribute\nunique to giant ellipticals (see Ho & Peng 2001 for a related discussion in the\ncontext of Seyfert galaxies). Moreover, Figure 5 shows that the degree of radio\nloudness evidently increases systematically with decreasing accretion rate, here\nparameterized by \u03bb.\n(7) LINERs have nonstandard central engines. As further elaborated in Ho et\nal. (2000) and Ho (2001a), LINERs share several characteristics expected of\nmassive black holes fed by an advection-dominated accretion flow (see reviews by\nNarayan, Mahadevan, & Quataert 1998; Quataert 2001) instead of a canonical\nthin accretion disk. The most pertinent of these are (a) the low Eddington\nratios and the inferred low mass accretion rates, (b) the absence of the big blue\nbump in the SEDs, (c) the characteristic radio loudness and its dependence on\nLbol /LEdd , (d) the prevalance of double-peaked broad emission lines and the\ndisk structure they imply, and (e) the low-ionization state of the line-emitting\ngas, a possible consequence of the particular form of the SEDs.\n(8) The nature of type 2 LINERs and transition objects is uncertain. An important unsolved problem is what fraction of the narrow-lined sources should\nbe considered genuine AGNs. To be sure, AGN-like LINER 2s do exist. Barth,\nFilippenko, & Moran (1999a) discovered that the LINER 2 nucleus of NGC 1052\nshows prominent broad-line emission when viewed in scattered light. The unification scheme, popular for Seyfert galaxies, evidently applies to at least some\nLINERs. If one assumes that all LINERs strictly adhere to the simplest form of\nthe unified model (that all type 2 sources are simply obscured type 1 sources),\nand that the ratio of LINER 2s to LINER 1s is the same as that of Seyfert 2s\nto Seyfert 1s in the Palomar survey, then the true AGN fraction among all LINERs is estimated to be between 45% and 65%, depending on whether transitions\nobjects are excluded or included, respectively (Ho 1996, 1999a). This estimate\nmay be overly optimistic for at least two reasons. First, the spectropolarimetric\nobservations of these very faint sources are demanding and still quite limited\n\n\f8\n\nHo\n\nFig. 6. Correlation between 2\u201310 keV X-ray luminosity and H\u03b1 luminosity for AGNs of various\ntypes. Adapted from Ho et\nal. (2001).\n\n(Barth et al. 1999a, 1999b), and so it may be unwise to generalize these results\nprematurely. And second, young, massive stars have been found to contribute\nsignificantly to the energy budget of some narrow-lined low-ionization objects\n(e.g., Maoz et al. 1998; Barth & Shields 2000). The first caveat may be partly\noffset by the fact that some genuine low-luminosity AGNs (e.g., M84, M87,\nSombrero) may intrinsically lack a broad-line region (Barth 2001).\nThe resolution of this problem requires access to data which are sensitive\nto a spectral region that is universally present in AGNs and is relatively unaffected by dust obscuration or modest photoelectric absorption. To be effective,\nthe data must have high angular resolution; to survey large samples, necessary\nfor statistical confidence, the data need to be gathered in an efficient mode. As\ndescribed above (item 4), the current generation of radio and hard X-ray data\nboth meet these requirements; we give greater weight to the latter because it\ncarries a larger fraction of the AGN bolometric luminosity. Figure 6, taken from\nthe preliminary results of the Chandra/ACIS survey of Ho et al. (2001), illustrates the potential of the X-ray data. Type 1 AGNs (LINERs, low-luminosity\nSeyferts, classical Seyferts, and quasars) obey a well-defined, linear correlation\nbetween hard X-ray (2 \u2212 10 keV) and H\u03b1 luminosity, down to LX (2\u201310 keV) \u2248\n3 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 . The LX \u2212 LH\u03b1 correlation strongly supports the hypothesis\nthat all of these sources, which span \u223c8 orders of magnitude in luminosity, share\nthe same physical origin.\nNote that the majority of the type 2 sources (LINERs and Seyferts) do have\ncompact X-ray cores. They follow the type 1 objects in Figure 6, albeit with\nsomewhat greater scatter and offset toward lower LX /LH\u03b1 by about a factor\nof 10. Interestingly, the X-ray hardness ratios of these sources suggest that\nabsorption is not the culprit for their X-ray weakness. The transition objects,\non the other hand, appear distinctively different as a class: most are undetected\nin X-rays, with upper limits as low as LX (2\u201310 keV) \u2248 3 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 . The\nincidence of compact radio cores in these objects (Filho et al. 2000) also appears\nto be lower than in LINERs or Seyferts.\n\n\fThe Population of AGNs in Nearby Galaxies\n4.\n\n9\n\nImplications for Black Hole Demography\n\nTo the extent that an AGN signature signifies accretion onto a massive black\nhole, a local AGN census gives us a lower limit on the fraction of nearby galaxies\nhosting massive black holes. If we accept that all LINERs, transition objects,\nand Seyferts are genuine AGNs, then the AGN statistics from the Palomar\nsurvey (Fig. 1) imply that black holes exist in >40% of all galaxies with BT \u2264\n12.5 mag. For bulge-dominated systems (E\u2013Sbc), this fraction climbs to >50%\u2013\n75% - not inconsistent with the 100% claimed by direct kinematic studies. But\nhow confident are we about the AGN-ness of nearby emission-line nuclei? The\nstatus of objects classified as Seyferts does not seem to be in dispute (for reasons\nthat reflect historical bias than concrete evidence). In any case, LINERs make\nup the majority of the population, and so deservingly receive closer scrutiny.\nThe evidence presented in \u00a7 3 shows that type 1 LINERs almost surely must be\nAGNs. The verdict for type 2 LINERs is much less clear-cut at the moment.\nWhile some sources have been shown to be powered by hot stars, others clearly\nhave all the hallmark attributes of bona fide AGNs. Perhaps the most telling\nstatistic is the incidence of compact radio and hard X-ray cores; although not\nyet well quantified, the preliminary results indicate that the detection rate is\nquite high in both bands (>50%).\nOn the other hand, the \"transition objects,\"\n\u223c\npostulated to be composite LINER/H II systems, may very well turn out to be\nunrelated to AGNs. Or if present, the AGN component must be significantly\nweaker than in \"regular\" LINERs. If we conservatively exclude all transition\nobjects from the AGN pool, then the overall AGN fraction should be reduced\nby 13% (Ho et al. 1997b).\nAcknowledgments.
