Introduction\nMagnetite (Fe3 O4 ) is one of the most familiar minerals for human beings. Known as a loadstone even in the\nGreek era, it has been attracting us for its magnetic properties. In 1939, Verwey discovered an abrupt increase of\nresistivity in magnetite by two orders of magnitude on\ncooling it below TV \u223c 120 K.1 Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the mechanism of this\nVerwey transition has been controversial for more than\nhalf a century.\nMagnetite is a kind of spinel ferrites. It crystallises in\nthe cubic inverse spinel structure at room temperature\n(see Fig. 1). One-third of Fe ions are on tetrahedral A\nsites with a Fe3+ formal valence constituting a diamond\nlattice. The remaining two-thirds of Fe ions are on octahedral B sites in a Fe2.5+ formal average valence state\nforming a pyrochlore lattice. Below TN \u223c 860 K magnetite is a ferrimagnet, where the magnetic moments of\nFe ions on the A and B sites are antiparallel and the\nnet magnetisation is \u223c 4 \u03bcB per unit formula. The tetrahedral (octahedral) oxygen coordination of the A (B)\nsite Fe ion causes ligand field splitting of the 3d level\ninto three-fold t2g and two-fold eg levels. The 3d orbitals\nwith minority (majority) spin on the A (B) site are fully\noccupied and half of Fe ions on the B sites accommodate\nan extra electron with minority spin in their t2g orbital\nin each.\nThe Verwey transition is a first-order phase transition accompanied by a lattice deformation from the cubic\n(Fd3\u0304m) symmetry. Below TV , the cubic cell is elongated\nto nearly rhombohedral along the [111]c direction (the\nsubscript 'c' denotes the cubic cell). The lattice symmetry of the low-temperature phase is still unresolved\nproblem. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies2\u20134 have\n\u2217 E-mail\n\naddress: atanaka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp\n\nFig. 1.

Cullen\nand Callen have discussed the transition using a spinless\none-band Hubbard model within the Hartree approximation.13 They assumed that the trigonal crystal-field\nis strong enough to lift all the degeneracy of the t2g orbitals and only the low-lying a1g orbital of every Fe ion\non the B sites is taken into account. They found that\na charge-ordered state is stabilised when Coulomb interaction between the neighbouring sites exceeds a critical\nvalue. Mishra et al. have extended the one-band model\nto a three-band model considering the triple degeneracy\nof the t2g orbitals.14 Their results are similar to those\nof Cullen and Callen's except for the ferro-orbital ordering, where only one kind of the t2g orbitals (xy, yz or zx\norbitals) is taken for all the occupied sites.15 Based on\nthe three-band model, Seo et al. have proposed a mechanism of the Verwey transition with a bond dimerisation\ncaused by the Peierls instability, where charge ordering\nis irrelevant to the transition.15 Recently, the electronic\nstate in the low-temperature phase has been investigated\nusing local density approximation + Hubbard U (LDA\n+ U) calculations16\u201319 based on the monoclinic lattice\nstructure shown by Wright et al .4 In the LDA + U calculations, a state with simultaneous charge and antiferroorbital ordering is obtained.\nLarge orbital moments at the B sites above and below TV have been observed in recent measurements of Fe\nL2,3 -edge x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).20\nHowever, more recent XMCD experiments have resulted\nin observing no net orbital moments.21 On the other\nhand, orbital moment \u223c 0.5 \u03bcB has been also inferred\nfrom the magnetic Compton scattering experiments.22\nIn previous works, we have investigated a spinless\nthree-band Hubbard model with the Hartree-Fock (HF)\napproximation and exact diagonalisation method and\nfound complex-orbital ordered (COO) states with noncollinear orbital moments as the ground states within a\nrealistic parameter range.23, 24 Here, the word 'complex'orbital represents an orbital which is described as a linear\ncombinations of the t2g basis functions (xy, yz and zx\norbitals) with complex number coefficients and has nonzero orbital moment.\nThe purpose of this paper is to describe the formation mechanism of the COO state and a possible COO\nstate realised in the low-temperature phase and to discuss the mechanism of the Verwey transition. We found\nthat the COO state is a kind of magnetic state within\nthe orbital degree of freedom. It does not originate from\nthe mechanisms in the conventional orbital order, which\ncan be described with the Kugel-Khomskii type model25\nor in usual magnetic materials, where orbital moments\nare induced by ordered spin via the spin-orbit interaction. A COO state with longer periodicity is expected\nto be stabilised in the low-temperature phase owning to\nthe strong coupling between the orbital polarisation and\n\nlattice distortion. The state explains experimentally observed rhombohedral cell deformation and Jahn-Teller\nlike distortion.\nThis paper is organised as follows. The details of the\nmodel Hamiltonian are presented in \u00a7 2. Charge and orbital ordered states found in the HF calculations with\nthe cubic structure (T > TV ) are described in \u00a7 3. The\nformation mechanism of the COO state is discussed analytically and the stability of the state against the electron\ncorrelation effects is examined with the exact diagonalisation method for a 16-site model in \u00a7 4. After short\nintroduction on the lattice structure and related properties in T < TV , discussion on the COO state in connection with lattice distortion and description on a COO\nstate obtained from the HF calculations with pseudoorthorhombic structure models for T < TV are provided\nin \u00a7 5. In \u00a7 6, electronic states above and below TV and\nthe mechanism of the Verwey transition are discussed.\nFinally, a summary is given in \u00a7 7.\n2. Three-Band Hubbard Model\nTo discuss possible charge and orbital orderings in\nmagnetite, we studied a spinless three-band Hubbard\nmodel for 3d electrons on the pyrochlore lattice of the\nB sites. The pyrochlore lattice is a network of cornershared tetrahedra consisting of linear chains with six different directions [1, \u00b11, 0]c, [1, 0, \u00b11]c and [0, 1, \u00b11]c (see\nFig. 1). This model was originally introduced by Mishra\net al.14 as an extension of the one-band Hubbard model\nof Cullen and Callen.13 In the three-band model, only t2g\nelectrons with minority spins at the B sites are considered\non the assumption that the spin moments at the B sites\nare collinear, and the 3d orbitals with majority spins are\nfully occupied. We furthermore introduce effects of the\nspin-orbit interaction, a trigonal crystal-field and electron hopping via adjacent O 2p orbitals. As shown later,\nelectron hopping among the B sites via the neighbouring oxygen ions is indispensable for the complex-orbital\norderings.\nThe Hamiltonian for t2g electrons with minority spins\non the B sites is written as\nX \u03bc\u03bd \u2020\ntij (ci\u03bc cj\u03bd + c\u2020j\u03bd ci\u03bc )\nH=\nhiji,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n+\n\nX\n\ni,\u03bc>\u03bd\n\n+\n\nU ni\u03bc ni\u03bd +\n\nX\n\nV ni\u03bc nj\u03bd\n\nhiji,\u03bc\u03bd\n\nh\ni\n2\n\u03b6\nc\u2020i\u03bc D{(\u03b1i * l)2 \u2212 } \u2212 (\u03b1S * l) ci\u03bd .\n3\n2\ni,\u03bc\u03bd\nX\n\n(1)\n\nHere t\u03bc\u03bd\nij denotes hopping integral between orbital \u03bc\n(=xy, yz or zx) at site i and orbital \u03bd at site j. c\u2020i\u03bc , ci\u03bc\nand ni\u03bc represent the creation, annihilation and number operators of an electron on orbital \u03bc at site i, respectively. hiji stands for summation over the nearestneighbour sites. U and V are the on-site and inter-site\nCoulomb energies, respectively. The first term in the\nsquare brackets on the third line describes the trigonal\ncrystal field, where l is an l = 1 pseudo-angular momentum operator, and the unit vector \u03b1i is along the\nthree-fold axis of site i.

Electronic State in the Cubic Structure\nElectronic structure calculations for the hightemperature phase were performed within the HF approximation assuming the cubic fcc unit cell with four independent B sites (see Fig. 1). The wave vectors throughout the first Brillouin zone of the fcc lattice were sampled\nusing the tetrahedron method.29 In the HF approximation, we have\nni\u03bc nj\u03bd \u2192ni\u03bc hnj\u03bd i + hni\u03bc inj\u03bd \u2212 hni\u03bc ihnj\u03bd i\n\u2212 c\u2020i\u03bc cj\u03bd hc\u2020j\u03bd ci\u03bc i \u2212 hc\u2020i\u03bc cj\u03bd ic\u2020j\u03bd ci\u03bc\n+ hc\u2020i\u03bc cj\u03bd ihc\u2020j\u03bd ci\u03bc i.\n\n(3)\n\nOnly the Hartree terms [the first three terms in eq.

(3)] are essential to keep the spherical symmetry of\n\nAuthor Name\n\n3\n\nthe Coulomb interaction. While orbital orderings with\nvariety of orbitals described by linear combinations of the\nthree t2g orbitals are obtained with the Fock terms, limited orderings with pure yz, zx or xy orbitals are found\nwithout the term.\nIn Fig. 2, phase diagrams obtained with D = 0.25 eV\nassuming the directions of minority spins along directions [111]c (a), [110]c (b) and [001]c (c) are shown. For\ncomparison, that calculated without the spin-orbit interaction (\u03b6 = 0) is also depicted in (d). In each panels, six different phases COO-I, COO-II, ROO-I, ROOII, CD-ROO-I and CD-ROO-II can be seen, except for\nthe additional small area of COO-III phase in Fig. 1(c).\nThese phases can be classified into two groups whether\nordered orbitals are described as linear combinations of\nthe xy, yz and zx orbitals with real number coefficients\n(labelled with 'ROO') or complex number coefficients (labelled with 'COO'). The CD-ROO-I and CD-ROO-II\nstates are real-number orbital-ordered (ROO) states accompanied by charge ordering where the layers of Fe2+\nand Fe3+ ions are alternately piled up along the [001]c\ndirection. For small values of tpd the ROO states are stable, whereas the complex-number orbital-ordered (COO)\nstates are favourable for large tpd values. The ROO states\nwith charge ordering prevail with large values of V . Differences among the phase diagrams are rather limited;\nlarge variations can be found only in the boundary between the COO-I and COO-II phases and the appearance\nof the COO-III phase with \u03b1S //[001]c.\nThe a1g orbital of every B site is occupied by 0.5 electron in the ROO-I state, a similar state but with an\nadditional ferro-orbital component (one of the xy, yz\nand zx orbitals) is stabilised in the ROO-II state. For\nD = 0 eV, we found the ferro-orbital ordered state corresponding to that discussed in the Hartree calculations\nin ref. 15 with small value of V , in the range of 0.05 eV\n\u2264 tpd \u2264 0.15 eV. The ROO-II emerges as a result of\nmixture of the ferro-orbital ordering and the a1g orbital\nordered state that are strengthen by the trigonal fields\n(D = 0.25 eV). The CD-ROO-I and CD-ROO-II states\nare accompanied by the Verwey charge orderings, where\nthe layers of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are alternately piled up\nalong the [001]c direction. The a1g orbital of every Fe2+\nion site is occupied in the CD-ROO-I state. In the CDROO-II state, \u221a12 [|yzi + |zxi] orbitals are occupied in\nFe2+ ions on [110]c chains as the lobes of the orbitals are\nparallel to the Fe2+ chains. The ROO-I and CD-ROO-I\nstates found in the small tpd regime are essentially the\nsame as those discussed by Cullen and Callen,13 where\nthe orbital degeneracy is lifted.\nFigure 3 shows the directions of the orbital moments\nin the COO-I, COO-II and COO-III states. The chiefly\noccupied t2g orbitals (\u223c 0.5 electron per site) and their\norbital moments are listed in Table I. The total orbital\nmoments are along the [111]c , [110]c and [001]c directions in the COO-I, COO-II and COO-III states, respectively. These COO states have the same periodicity to\nthe crystal, but the orbital ordering spontaneously lower\nthe space group symmetry from cubic (F d3m) to rhombohedral (R3m), orthorhombic (Imm2) and tetragonal\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

Phase diagrams of the ground states for the high-temperature phase in V -tpd plane with D = 0.25 eV. In the calculations, the\ndirections of minority spins are assumed along directions [111]c (a), [110]c (b) and [001]c (c). The same but without the spin-orbit\ninteraction is also shown in (d) for comparison. 'ROO' and 'COO' represent real- and complex- orbital ordered states, respectively,\nand 'CD' denotes the state with the Verwey charge ordering. Weak charge disproportionation occurs in the COO-I and COO-II states\n(for details see text), and the charge distributions in the ROO-I, ROO-II and COO-III states are uniform.\n\nFig. 3. Alignment of orbital moments in Fe4 O4 cube for the COO-I (a), COO-II (b) and COO-III (c) states. The large and small\ncircles signify Fe ions at the B sites and oxygen ions, respectively. The arrows on the four independent B sites labelled 1 - 4 denote\nthe directions of the orbital moments. The grey (black) arrows represent electron-poor (electron-rich) sites in (b). The magnetic easy\naxes of the COO-I, COO-II and COO-III states are oriented along the [111]c , [110]c and [001]c directions, respectively. Details of the\nelectronic states on each of the COO states are listed in Table I.\n\n(I42m), respectively. Because of noncollinear alignment\nof the moments, the size of total orbital moments are\nrather small. For instance, in the COO-I state, each B\nsite has orbital moment of about 0.5 \u03bcB . However, the\ntotal orbital moment is only \u223c 0.20 \u03bcB per B site, since\nthe orbital moment at site 1 is in the opposite direction to the sum of those at sites 2, 3 and 4, and this\nalmost cancel out the net orbital moment of each Fe4 O4\ncube. As was mentioned before, the spin-orbit interaction is not essential ingredient for the stability of the\n\nCOO states. This becomes evident when the results obtained with [see Figs. 2(a)-(c)] and without [see Fig. 2(d)]\nthe spin-orbit interaction are compared, where the phase\nboundaries between the COO and ROO states are almost\nunchanged among the diagrams. On the other hand, relative stability among the three COO states are affected\nby the direction of the spin moment, since the differences\nin the total energies among the three are only \u223c0.01 eV\nper site. Indeed, as clearly seen in Figs. 2(a)-(d), each\nof the COO states is more stabilised when \u03b1S is along\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nAuthor Name\n\nFull Paper\n\n5\n\nTable I.

The charge disproportionation of the\nCOO-II state approaches uniform with decreasing value\nof V and increasing tpd , and the differences in the occupation number between electron-poor and electron\u2013\nrich sites are from 0.05 to 0.29 in the phase diagram\nof Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, the COO-I state is considerably uniform, and the differences in the occupation\nnumber among sites are at most 0.09 in the phase diagram of Fig. 2(a).\nThe band structure and the density of states (DOS) for\nthe COO-I state are shown in Fig. 4. In our calculations,\nthe wave vectors throughout the first Brillouin zone of\nthe fcc lattice were sampled. Note that orbital orderings\nother than the ROO-I state spontaneously break the cubic symmetry, and thus some symmetry points in the\nBrillouin zone of the fcc lattice become inequivalent. For\nexample, the L point at ( 21 , 21 , 12 ) and that at (- 21 , 12 , 12 )\nare not equivalent in the COO-I state whose trigonal axis\nis along [111]c shown in Fig. 3(a). Within the mean-field\napproximation, only a particular orbital can be occupied\non each sites to reduce Coulomb repulsion energy, in the\nlarge U limit. The four lowest band in the figure, indeed, correspond to the states mainly consisting from\nthe orbitals listed in Table I. The low symmetries in the\noccupied orbitals and the large components of hopping\nmatrices which hybridise different kinds of orbitals, e.g.,\ntyz,zx\nmake these bands repulsive in each other. As a reij\nsult, these bands are rather flat, disentangled and only\ncrossing on limited symmetry points or lines. We can find\na pseudo-gap \u223c 0.2 eV in the vicinity the Fermi level,\nwhich is only closed around the L ( 12 , 12 , 12 ) point on the\ntrigonal axis of the COO-I state.\nFigure 5 shows the band structure and the density\nof states for the COO-II state.

Again, a pseudo-gap\nin the vicinity of the Fermi level can be found among\nthe low-lying four bands. The gap is closed only on the\n\u0393\u2013K symmetry line along the [110]c direction, which is\non the mirror plane of the COO-II state, and thus the\nCOO-II state is a zero gap semiconductor. The density\nof states near the Fermi level reduces with increasing V .\nSince these COO states are on the verge of gap opening,\nit is expected that further symmetry lowering caused by\nlattice distortion in the low-temperature phase would result in the formation of the insulating gap.

Formation Mechanism of COO State\n4.1 Interacting Fe4 tetrahedral molecules of B sites\nIn the previous section, we have found the COO states\nstabilised in large tpd regime in the spinless three-band\nHubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice. However, it\nis not obvious why such unconventional orbital orderings realise in this system. To gain more insight about\nthese peculiar orbital orderings, let us consider an isolated tetrahedron of B sites in infinite U limit as the\nfirst step. The pyrochlore lattice can then be treated as\na fcc lattice of these tetrahedral molecules of B sites.\nWithin HF approximation, only one kind of orbital can\nbe occupied in each of the B sites, if U = \u221e. We further assume the solution possesses the trigonal symmetry\nwith the [111]c axis and is invariant with combined operator of time reversal and vertical mirror. The symmetry\nis the same as the COO-I state and here, we use the same\nsite labels in Fig. 3(a). With these assumptions, the wave\nfunction at site 1 can take one of the a1 or e\u00b1 symmetry\norbitals:\n1\n|1, a1 i = \u221a (|1, yzi + |1, zxi + |1, xyi)\n3\n1\n|1, e+ i = \u221a (\u03c9 2 |1, yzi + \u03c9|1, zxi + |1, xyi)\n3\n\u22121\n|1, e\u2212 i = \u221a (\u03c9|1, yzi + \u03c9 2 |1, zxi + |1, xyi)\n3\nand the wave function at site 2, 3 and 4 can be written\nas\n|2i = v|2, yzi + u|2, zxi + u\u2217 |2, xyi\n\n|3i = u\u2217 |3, yzi + v|3, zxi + u|3, xyi\n\n|4i = u|4, yzi + u\u2217 |4, zxi + v|4, xyi,\n\nwhere u and v are complex and real constants, respectively, and satisfy the relation 2|u|2 + v 2 = 1.

(1) and t\u03c3 =\n3|tdd\u03c3 |/4. Here, for simplicity, the values of parameters\ntdd\u03c0 , D, \u03b6 and\n\u221a V are assumed to be zero. Substituting\nu = ei\u03c6 cos \u03b8/ 2 and v = sin \u03b8, we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0\nn\n2\n\u03b5 = \u2212 t\u03c3 cos \u03b8 cos 2\u03c6 \u2212\nn\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\n2\nn\n+ tpd cos \u03b8 cos 2\u03c6 +\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0\n+ 2tpd sin2 \u03b8 cos\nn .\n(4)\n3\nEither e+ or e\u2212 symmetry MO can have the lowest energy among the three MOs on the triangular cluster:\nq\n\u03b5\u00b11 = \u2212 t2\u03c3 + t\u03c3 tpd + t2pd\n\nat \u03b8 = 0 and\n\n\"\n\n\u22121\n\n2\u03c6 = \u00b1 tan\n\n#\n\u221a\n3t\u03c3\n\u03c0\n.\n+\n2tpd + t\u03c3\n3\n\nThe value of 2\u03c6 for this lowest energy MO is within \u03c0/3 <\n|2\u03c6| < 2\u03c0/3 and thus orbitals on each sites are complex\norbitals. For example, the orbitals at sites 2, 3 and 4 are\nx+ , y + and z + orbitals, respectively, when \u03b8 = 0 and\n2\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 are chosen for the e+ symmetry MO and this\norbital alignment on the three sites is the same as that for\nthe COO-I state in Table I. These MOs on the triangular\ncluster are further hybridised with the orbitals on site 1\nhaving the same symmetry. The hopping integrals, i.e.,\nh0 = h1, a1 |H|234, a1 i and h\u00b11 = h1, e\u00b1 |H|234, e\u00b1i, can\nbe written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\nn\nn\nh = \u2212t\u03c3 sin \u03b8 \u2212 2tpd cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 \u2212\n3\n\nand thus the energies of the bonding \u03b5nb and antibonding \u03b5na states of the MO and orbital on site 1 in each\nsymmetries can be obtained as\ni\n1h n p n 2\n(5)\n\u03b5 \u00b1 (\u03b5 ) + 4(hn )2 .\n\u03b5nb,a =\n2\nFor the tetrahedron with two electrons, the lowestenergy electronic configurations are those with an electron on the e\u00b1 symmetry MO of the triangular portion of\nthe tetrahedron (E \u00b1 ) and the other electron on the bonding MO with e\u2213 symmetry (Eb\u2213 ) , i.e., E + Eb\u2212 or E \u2212 Eb+\n\n\fJ.

This is because only\none particular orbital can be occupied in each sites in\nlarge U limit. Variations in these parameters are larger\nfor the results with realistic parameters in Table II(b).\nHowever, no qualitative differences are found between\nthe two. As expected, the lowest-energy two MOs E +\nand Eb\u2212 are dominantly occupied. In addition, about 0.4\nelectron resides on the A1 symmetry MO with the third\nlowest energy. This is because the lowest two MOs can\nbe hybridised with the higher ones through the intermolecular hopping. The value of \u03b8 \u223c \u221212\u25e6 is much\nsmaller than that in isolated tetrahedron: \u03b8 \u223c \u221260\u25e6 .\nThis large discrepancy in the value of \u03b8 can be explained by the differences in the MO occupations. Indeed, if the lowest-energy two MOs and the third-lowest\nMO are assumed to accommodate 0.8 and 0.4 electron,\nrespectively, in the isolated tetrahedron, the configuration (E + )0.8 (Eb\u2212 )0.8 (A1 )0.4 has the minimum total energy at \u03b8 \u223c \u221211\u25e6 and 2\u03c6 \u223c 94\u25e6 with parameter values\ntdd\u03c3 = \u22120.275 eV and tpd = 0.4 eV.\nWe have described the COO-I state as the ferro-MO\nordered state of the tetrahedral molecules of the B sites,\nassuming the trigonal symmetry. Since there are similarity among the COO states, one may consider all these\nstates can be described by a more general scheme. In\nthe next subsection, we will find that all these COO\nstates can be regarded as a ferromagnetic state of fictitious orbital moments of the pseudo-d symmetry MOs\non the tetrahedral molecules. In this context, the differences among them are only magnetisation directions of\nthe ferromagnetic state.\n\n\u03b3i\n\nconfigurations. Note that configurations such as Eb+ Eb\u2212\ncost large Coulomb repulsion energy at site 1 and are not\nfavourable. The minimum total energy of E + Eb\u2212 configuration with respect to \u03b8 and \u03c6 is found at \u03b8 \u223c \u221260\u25e6 and\n2\u03c6 \u223c 89\u25e6 with parameter values tdd\u03c3 = \u22120.275 eV and\ntpd = 0.4 eV, where the COO-I state is the ground state\non the pyrochlore lattice.\nNow let us consider electron hopping between tetrahedral molecules on the pyrochlore lattice in addition to\nthe internal hopping in each of them. The Hamiltonian\nfor the Bloch function with wave vector k can be easily\nobtained by replacing the hopping matrix of the isolated\ntetrahedron:\ni\nh\n\u03bc\u03bd\nik*(rj\u2032 \u2212ri )\n,\n1\n+\ne\nt\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2192\nt\nij\nij\n\nwhere site j \u2032 is equivalent site to j on the adjacent tetrahedron sharing a h110ic chain with site j and ri (rj \u2032 )\nrepresents the position of the site i (j \u2032 ). For the Bloch\nstates with k around the \u0393 point, the intra- and intermolecular hopping terms are in-phase (\u223c 2t\u03bc\u03bd\nij ), and thus\nthe energy gain from the hopping term is approximately\ntwo time as large as that of the isolated tetrahedron.\nThis stabilises a COO state, where the lowest two MOs\nin each tetrahedron are mainly occupied, and they are coherently aligned. On the other hand, for the Bloch states\nwith k in the vicinity of the boundary of the first Brillouin zone, the phases of the intra- and inter-molecular\nhopping terms are not matched. This causes mixture of\nthe lowest two MOs and the higher ones through the\ninter-molecular hopping, because of breaking of the local\nsymmetry. This would modify the ordered MOs of the\nCOO state from those in the isolated tetrahedron.\nTo verify the above scenario with interacting tetrahedral molecules of B sites, the density matrix \u03c1i\u03bc,j\u03bd =\nhc\u2020j\u03bd ci\u03bc i for a tetrahedral molecule of B sites (in a 12\u00d712\nsize) in the COO-I state on the pyrochlore lattice is calculated and diagonalised. Results obtained within the\nHF approximation with two kinds of parameter sets are\nshown in Table II: in (a), U =40.0 eV and tdd\u03c0 = D = 0,\nand in (b), U =4.0 eV and D = 0.25 eV; in both calcu-\n\n4.2 Stability of COO state and pseudo-SO(3) symmetry\nA COO state in the eg orbitals has been proposed to\nexplain the properties of ferromagnetic metallic phase\nof doped manganites, where the static Jahn-Teller deformation disappears.30\u201332 The eg orbitals |x2 \u2212 y 2 i and\n|3z 2 \u2212 r2 i are combined with the complex number coefficients, e.g., \u221a12 [|3z 2 \u2212 r2 i \u00b1 i|x2 \u2212 y 2 i] in this COO\nstate, and because of the isotropic charge distribution,\nthe COO state is not associated with the Jahn-Teller deformation. Kubo and Hirashima, however, have argued\nthat the COO state in ferromagnetic metallic manganites is unstable, when the electron correlation effect is\ntaken into account.33 We, therefore, performed calculations on a finite size system using the exact diagonalisation method to clarify whether the COO states in our\nthree-band model are stabile under the electron correla-\n\n\fJ.

To reduce the\nnumber of the many-body basis functions, we assume\nU = \u221e. The other parameters are the same as \u00a7 3. The\nHamiltonian of the 16-site model is diagonalised with\nthe Lanczos algorithm34 to obtain the ground-state wave\nfunction.\nThe orbital orders found in the ground state of the\n16-site model are mapped on the V -tpd plane in Fig. 6.\n\u22121\n(1, 1, 1) are\nIn the calculation, D = 0.25 eV and \u03b1S = \u221a\n3\nadopted. The regions of the ground states corresponding\nto the ROO-I and COO-I states can be seen. To examine\ninstability toward\nP the Verwey charge ordering, the staggered potential i\u03bc \u03b4i ni\u03bc was also applied in the ROO-I\nregion, where \u03b4i = +\u03b4 and \u03b4i = \u2212\u03b4 for the [110]c and\n[11\u03040]c chains, respectively, and 2\u03b4=0.05 eV is adopted.\nThe difference between the occupation numbers on the\n[110]c and [11\u03040]c chains continuously varies from \u223c 0.1 to\n\u223c 0.3 with increasing values of V and tpd . These results\nare consistent with the phase diagrams in Fig. 2 obtained\nfrom the HF calculations.\nAs was discussed in \u00a7 3, the energies of the three COO\nstates are nearly degenerated within \u223c0.01 eV, and each\nof them can be stabilised when \u03b1S is oriented to the direction of their total magnetic moments. In fact, almost\nthe same diagrams as in Fig. 6 were found except the\nCOO-I region is replaced by those for the COO-II or\n\u22121\nCOO-III states with \u03b1S = \u221a\n(1, 1, 0) or \u03b1S = (0, 0, \u22121),\n2\nrespectively. These COO states can even continuously\ntransform into the others as we gradually vary \u03b1S . As\ndiscussed later, the COO states are results of spontaneous breaking of the inherent pseudo-spherical symmetry analogous to the ferromagnetic order in the Heisenberg model.\nFigure 7 shows the relationship between the trigonal\n\nfield D and the total orbital moment per B site. While\nlarge orbital moments are induced and the COO-I state\nis found to be the ground state for D & 0.1 eV, the COO\nstate collapses and only small orbital moments appear for\nsmall values of D. From the analysis of the 3 \u00d7 3 density\nmatrix hc\u2020i\u03bd ci\u03bc i on each site, we found orbital occupation\nin each site for D . 0.1 eV is described as the mixed\nstate, where two kinds of the e\u03c0g orbitals are occupied\nwith the same probability, except for a small deviation\n(\u223c 10%) caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Thus, this\nground state can be considered as an orbital-liquid state\nwith small orbital polarisation owing to the spin-orbit\ninteraction. On the other hand, for D & 0.1 eV, one particular orbital shown in Table I is dominantly occupied in\neach site, and the occupation probabilities for the other\ntwo are small (less than 5% for D = 0.25 eV). Contrastingly, the COO-I state remains to be the lowest energy\nsolution with the HF approximation down to D=0. It\nis also noteworthy that even when the spin-orbit coupling \u03b6 on all site is set to zero except for a site and \u03b1S\nis oriented to the trigonal axis of this site, the COO-I\nstate is still obtained with D & 0.1 eV. This also shows\nrobustness of the COO-I state for D & 0.1 eV.\nTo understand this change in the ground state as a\nfunction of D, let us consider an isolated tetrahedral\nmolecule of the B sites accommodating one electron. The\nt2g orbitals on four B sites in the tetrahedron are reduced\nto five different basis sets of irreducible representations\nin the Td symmetry: A1 + E + T1 + 2T2 . The MOs are\nclassified according to the symbols of the irreducible representations, and the bases and energies are described in\nthe Appendix. The energy levels corresponding to the\nbonding and antibonding states of two T2 basis sets (T2\u03c3\nand T2\u03c0 ) are labelled T2b and T2a , respectively. In Fig. 8,\nMO level diagrams for the isolated tetrahedral molecule\nobtained with tpd = 0 eV (a) and tpd = 0.3 eV (b) are\nshown.\nFor small value of tpd , the lowest is the A1 level, where\nthe a1g orbitals are occupied by 0.25 electron in each.\nThe second lowest is the E level for small values of D\n\n\fJ.

Molecular-orbital levels of the isolated tetrahedral\nmolecule of the B sites as a function of D obtained with tpd =0 eV\n(a) and tpd =0.3 eV (b).\n\nand is the T2b level for D & 0.45 eV. For large value of\ntpd , the occupation of the e\u03c0g orbitals is more favourable,\nand the E level, where the e\u03c0g orbitals are occupied for\nall B sites, is the lowest level. However, the T2b level\nbecomes the lowest for D & 0.45 eV.\nFrom these level diagrams, we can explain the change\nin the orbital ordering qualitatively. For the isolated\ntetrahedron with two electrons, the E 2 closed-shell configuration is favourable in the case that the energy separation between the lowest E and higher levels is large.\nThis costs large on-site Coulomb energy since two kind\nof the e\u03c0g orbitals, i.e., eu and ev , should be occupied\non each B sites (see Table A*1). In this situation, large\nquantum fluctuation is expected even on the pyrochlore\nlattice, since electrons should avoid occupying the same\nsite with this limited orbital degree of the freedom. On\nthe other hand, if the T2b and E levels are nearly degenerated [\u03b5(T2b )\u2212 \u03b5(E) . 0.2 eV], electrons would prefer to\noccupy a particular orbital in each of the B sites utilising both the E and T2b basis sets to minimise the on-site\nCoulomb energy.\nFrom above discussions, the pseudo-degeneracy of the\nE and T2b levels is the requisite for the formation of\nthe COO state. If we regard these MOs as irreducible\nrepresentations of a d state in the Td symmetry, i.e., d =\nE + T2b , the fictitious d symmetry MOs with magnetic\nquantum number m can be defined as\n \u0303 m = \u00b12i = \u221a1 (|E, vi \u00b1 i|T2b , \u03b6i) ,\n|d,\n2\n \u0303 m = \u00b11i = \u221a1 (\u2213|T2b , \u03b7i \u2212 i|T2b , \u03bei) ,\n|d,\n2\n \u0303\n|d, m = 0i = |E, ui.\n\n(6)\n\nIf the pseudo-SO(3) symmetry in the Coulomb interactions among these d \u0303 MOs are further assumed, the most\nlowest energy configuration for accommodating two electrons in this spinless d \u0303 MOs is that obeys Hund's second\n \u0303 m = 2i and |d,\n \u0303 m = 1i\nrule: the d \u03032 configuration, where |d,\norbitals occupied with the fictitious total orbital moments L\u0303 = 3. Thus, the COO state can be interpreted as\na ferromagnetic (FM) alignment of the fictitious orbital\n\n9\n\nmoments of the d \u0303 MOs, which is parallel to the real magnetisation direction of the COO states. From this viewpoint, the differences among the COO states are merely\nthe directions of the magnetisation of the FM state. The\nCOO-I, COO-II and COO-III are, therefore, only three\nparticular cases of the FM state with magnetisation directions h111ic , h110ic and h001ic , respectively.\nTo check the validity of the assumption of the pseudoSO(3) symmetry, the density matrix \u03c1i\u03bc,j\u03bd for the tetrahedral molecule is diagonalised. For the COO-III state\ncorresponding to the FM state with the [001]c magnetisation direction, the largest three eigenvalues are\nw1 = 0.73, w2 = 0.54 and w3 = 0.40. The overlap\nbetween these eigenfunctions of \u03c1 and the d \u0303 orbitals in\n \u0303 m = 2i| = 0.96, |hw2 |d,\n \u0303 m = 1i| = 0.88\neq. (6) are |hw1 |d,\n \u0303\nand |hw3 |d, m = 0i| = 0.51. As expected, the dominantly\n \u0303 m = 2i and\noccupied two MOs are correspond to the |d,\n \u0303\n|d, m = 1i orbitals and their deviations from these d \u0303 orbitals are fairly small. The COO-II state correspond to\nthe FM state with the [110]c direction. The wave functions of the d \u0303 states can be easily obtained by rotating\nthe quantisation axis to the magnetisation direction using the representation matrix Dm,m\u2032 [R(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)] of the\nrotation R(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) described by the Eulerian angles. For\n \u0303 m\u2032 i orbital with the [110]c quantisation\ninstance, the |d,\naxis can be obtained as\n2\nX\n \u0303 m\u2032 = 2i =\n \u0303 mi Dm,2 [R(\u03c0/4, \u03c0/2, 0)]\n|d,\n|d,\nm=\u22122\n\n\u221a\ni\n1\n6\n=\n|E, ui \u2212 (|T2b , \u03bei \u2212 |T2b , \u03b7i) + \u221a |T2b , \u03b6i,\n4\n2\n2 2\n \u0303 m\u2032 = 1i = \u221ai |E, vi + 1 (|T2b , \u03bei + |T2b , \u03b7i) ,\n|d,\n2\n2\n\u221a\n \u0303 m\u2032 = 0i = \u2212 1 |E, ui + 3 |T2b , \u03b6i.\n|d,\n2\n2\nThe largest three eigenvalues of \u03c1 in the COO-II state are\nw1 = 0.78, w2 = 0.66 and w3 = 0.39 and the overlaps\n \u0303 m\u2032 = 2i| = 0.99, |hw2 |d,\n \u0303 m\u2032 = 1i| = 0.87 and\nare |hw1 |d,\n\u2032\n \u0303 m = 0i| = 0.39. Again, dominantly occupied two\n|hw3 |d,\nMOs are reproduced well with the pseudo-SO(3) symmetry assumption. The examination of \u03c1 in the COO-I\nstate leads to the same conclusion, and we now realise\nthat the E + and Eb\u2212 MOs discussed in the previous sub \u0303 m = 2i and |d,\n \u0303 m = 1i MOs,\nsection correspond to the |d,\nrespectively.\nThe pseudo-spherical symmetry, which permits the\ncreation of Hund's rule state on each Fe4 unit, is the fundamental ingredient for the formation and stabilisation of\nthe COO states in the present system. In contrast, such\ninherent symmetry has not been discussed and seems to\nbe absent in the eg system for the ferromagnetic manganites.30\u201333\n5.

Recently, Wright et al. refined the\ncrystal structure of the low-temperature phase from xray and neutron diffraction experiments.3, 4 The same\ncrystal structure model with the orthorhombic Pmca\npseudo-symmetry is applied for the analysis. The inequivalent sites are reduced from 16 sites to 6 sites within\nthe approximation, and they are labelled B1a, B1b, B2a,\nB2b, B3 and B4 (see Fig. 9). Jahn-Teller-like distortions\n\nAuthor Name\n\nof the oxygen octahedra surrounding the B1 sites are\nfound below TV from their experiments, and charge disproportionation is inferred from variations in the Fe-O\nbond lengths.\nThe electronic state in the low-temperature phase has\nbeen investigated using LDA + U calculations16\u201319 based\non the monoclinic lattice structure shown by Wright et\nal .4 From the LDA + U calculations, a state with simultaneous charge and antiferro-orbital ordering is obtained.\nIn the state, the B2a, B2b and B3 sites are vacant, and\nthe xy orbitals are occupied at the B4 sites. The yz and\nzx orbitals align alternately along the B1 chains, where\nthe Jahn-Teller-like distortions are observed.\nThe cell distortion of magnetite in the low-temperature\nphase is closely approximated by that with a rhombohedral symmetry,2, 36, 37 although the atomic displacements in the cell have pseudo-orthorhombic symmetry.4\nThe monoclinic distortion in the low-temperature phase\nhas been conventionally interpreted as the result of the\ncombination of the microscopic orthorhombic distortion\ncaused by charge ordering and macroscopic rhombohedral distortion owing to the magnetostriction. The magnetic easy axes are oriented along the [111]c direction\nin the high-temperature phase and the monoclinic cm axis (more precisely, it tilts toward the [111]c direction\nby 2\u25e638 ) in the low-temperature phase.39 Here the monoclinic am -, bm - and cm -axes are along the [1\u03041\u03040]c , [11\u03040]c\nand [001]c directions, respectively. Interestingly, the easy\naxis switching accompanied by simultaneous change of\ncm -axis is observed by applying external magnetic field\nbelow TV ,40 and the dependence of the Verwey transition\ntemperature under the application of magnetic field was\nalso reported.41, 42 Moreover, the magnetoelectric effects\nwhich indicate triclinic distortion in the low-temperature\nphase were also discussed.43\u201348\nAs was discussed in the previous section, the COO\nstate is a kind of magnetic order within the orbital degree of freedom. This means that its orbital polarisation depends on the magnetisation directions and thus\nstrong coupling between the magnetism and lattice distortions, i.e., magnetostriction, is anticipated. Because\nof this strong coupling with the lattice, the COO state\nin the high-temperature phase would be modified by the\nmonoclinic lattice distortion below TV . In the remainder\nof this section, we will discuss the relationship between\nthe COO state and lattice distortion. A COO state expected to be stabilised by the monoclinic lattice distortion in the low-temperature phase will be also presented.\n5.2\n\nRelationship between lattice distortions and COO\nstates\nTo discuss the relationship between the lattice deformation and COO states, the hopping integrals between\nthe dominantly occupied orbitals hij = hi, \u03bc|Ht |j, \u03bdi in\nthe COO-I, COO-II and COO-III states are examined.\nHere, |i, \u03bci represents the dominantly occupied orbital \u03bc\nat site i which is listed in Table I. If the absolute value\nof the hopping integral is increased by the Fe\u2013Fe bond\ncontraction, the energy of corresponding bonding state\nis decreased, and this would reinforce the stability of the\nordering.

Here, t\u03c3 = 3|tdd\u03c3 |/4 is the absolute value of the\nhopping integral of the \u03c3-bond, which is most sensitive to\nthe change in the bond length among the hopping integrals. Note that there are the relations h32 =h24 =h43 and\nh14 =h12 =h13 for the COO-I state, h34 =h42 =h21 =h13 for\nthe COO-II and COO-III states, and h14 =h23 for the\nCOO-III state.\nJudging from the derivatives, the Fe\u2013Fe bond between\nthe two electron-poor sites of the COO-II state, on which\norbitals |110i are occupied, is most sensitive to the variation of t\u03c3 . Thus, the orthorhombic distortion, in which\nthe Fe\u2013Fe bond along the [11\u03040] direction is contracted,\nis expected to stabilise the COO-II state. Similarly, the\nCOO-I state is accompanied by the rhombohedral lattice distortion; three Fe\u2013Fe bonds on the triangle of sites\n2, 3 and 4 of each of the Fe4 O4 cubes are compressed,\nand this leads to elongation of the cubic cell along the\n[111]c diagonal direction. On the other hand, only small\ntetrahedral distortion is expected for the COO-III state.\n5.3\n\nHartree-Fock calculations for the low-temperature\nphase\nThe spinless three-band Hubbard model described in\neq. (1) was investigated to find the electronic state realised in magnetite below TV . The calculations were carried out within the HF approximation [eq. (3)]. In order\nto introduce the effects of the lattice deformation for the\nlow-temperature phase, we considered the variation in\nthe values of hopping integrals as a function of Fe\u2013Fe\nbond length r. For simplicity, we take into account such\nr dependence on the value of the hopping integral for\nthe \u03c3-bond \u2212t\u03c3 = 3tdd\u03c3 /4, which is most sensitive to\nthe change in r among the hopping integrals. The value\nof hopping integral is approximately proportional to r\u22125 ,\nand we expand t\u03c3 up to the first order of the deviation \u03b4r\nfrom the Fe\u2013Fe distance in the high-temperature phase\nrc = 2.966 \u00c5 as\nt\u03c3 = tc\u03c3 (1 \u2212 5\u03b2\u03c3 \u03b4r/rc ),\n\n11\n\nTable IV.

A constant parameter \u03b2\u03c3 is introduced to change the extent of the distortion effects for\nthe \u03c3-bonds,\n\u221a and we\u221aassumed \u03b2\u03c3 = 3 in the calculations.\nThe ac / 2 \u00d7 ac / 2 \u00d7 2ac orthorhombic unit cell consists of 16 B sites (see Fig. 9) is assumed. For simplicity,\neffects of atomic displacements in the cell are considered\nonly as variations in hopping integrals, and the monoclinic tilt of the cm -axis toward the am -axis are neglected.\nNote that the pairs of sites labelled with 'a' and 'b', e.g.,\nB1a and B1b, are equivalent without this monoclinic tilt\nof the cm -axis because of recovery of the bm -cm mirror\nplane. Two sets of the atomic coordinates with the centric Pmca4 and acentric Pmc 21 35 symmetries were used\nto evaluate the values of t\u03c3 , and those adopted in the HF\ncalculations are listed in Table IV. The direction of the\nminority spin moment is assumed to be along the cm axis, i.e., \u03b1S = (0, 0, \u22121) since the magnetic easy axis for\nT < TV is approximately along this direction. The other\nparameters are the same as those used in the calculations\nfor the high-temperature phase: D = 0.25 eV, U = 4.0 eV\nand \u03b6 = 0.052 eV. The wave vectors throughout the first\nBrillouin zone of the orthorhombic lattice were sampled\nin the HF calculations.\nFrom the both calculations using the hopping integrals\nevaluated from the Pmca and Pmc 21 structural models, we obtained a charge and complex-orbital ordered\nstate (COO-IV). Schematic representation of the COOIV state is shown in Fig. 10, and its details are listed in\nTable V. For the both symmetries, the COO-IV state is\nfound as the lowest energy solution in almost the same\narea on V -tpd plane where the COO phases presence in\nFig. 2(c).

The open and hatched circles inside the triangles are above and below kagom\u00e9\nplane, respectively, and the others are on the kagom\u00e9 lattice. The site labels in the Pmca symmetry are also shown.\n\nstructure, the symmetry of the COO-IV state is spontaneously lowered from the Pmca and Pmc 21 to the monoclinic P 2/c and P c, respectively. However, the symmetry\nof the COO-IV state is essentially P 2/c and deviation\nfrom this is small in the calculation with the Pmc 21 lattice symmetry. Thereby, for the remainder of this paper,\nwe refer the B sites by the labels for the Pmca lattice\nsymmetry.\nAs seen in Fig. 10, the COO-IV state can be regarded\nas an alternative stacking of microscopic layers (thickness\nac ) of the COO-II states with two different orientations:\nthose having easy-axes along the [101]c and [011]c directions. The horizontal planes at the z-coordinate of the\nlattice zm = 1/4 and zm = 3/4 correspond to 'domain\nwalls', on which the B2 sites are located. Each of the B2a\nsites is placed at the intersection of a [011\u0304]c chain of the\n|011i orbitals and a [101\u0304]c chain of the |101i orbitals, and\nits orbital moment is along the [111]c direction. Similarly,\neach of the B2b sites is positioned at a intersection of a\n[011]c chain of the |x\u00b1 i orbital and a [101]c chain of the\n|y \u00b1 i orbitals, and its orbital moment is oriented along\n\nthe [1\u03041\u03040]c direction. The B1-B3 bonds are the most contracted bonds, and both the chains of the |011i and |101i\norbitals of the COO-II layers are on these bonds. From\nthe discussions in \u00a7 5.2, this explains why the COO-IV\nstate is stabilised with the lattice distortion in the lowtemperature phase.\nThe magnetic easy axis of the COO-IV is oriented to\nthe [223]c direction tilted from the cm -axis toward the\n[111]c direction about 43\u25e6 and the total orbital moment\n\u223c 0.2 \u03bcB per B site. The experimental easy axis is also\ntilted from the cc -axis toward the same direction below\nTV . However, the tilting angle is about 2\u25e6 .38\nThe charge disproportionation in the COO-IV state\nis rather moderate similar to the COO-II state, and the\ncharge order satisfies the Anderson condition, which constrains every tetrahedron to have two electrons. From\nthe bond valence sums analysis of the x-ray and neutron\ndiffraction experiments,3, 4 charge ordering with apparent local charges of Fe2.4+ and Fe2.6+ has been found in\nthe low-temperature phase.

For the Pmca\nsymmetry, the band gap at the Fermi energy does not\nopen; it is closed at the Y(0, 12 , 0) point and mostly closed\nat the X( 12 , 0, 0) point. The band gaps at the L points\nwhich are on the direction from the centre of the Fe4 O4\ncube to the electron-rich sites are small in the COO-II\nstate, and corresponding bands at the L( 12 , 12 , 21 ) point of\nthe two COO-II micro-layers come to the X( 12 , 0, 0) point\nand those of the L(\u2212 21 , 21 , 12 ) and L( 21 , \u2212 21 , 21 ) points are\npositioned at the Y(0, 21 , 0) point. In contrast to the results of the calculations with the Pmca lattice symmetry,\nthe COO-IV state obtained assuming the Pmc 21 symmetry has the band gap at the Fermi level, and its magnitude is \u223c 2.5\u00d710\u22122 eV for V = 0.3 eV and tpd = 0.35 eV.\nHowever, the band gap does not open for the small values\nof V .\u221a\n\u221a\nA 2ac \u00d7 2ac \u00d7 2ac supercell comprising 64 B sites,\nwhich is the same dimension to the Cc symmetry cell,\nis also examined using the hopping integrals obtained\nfrom the Pmc 21 atomic coordinates. However, the COOIV state is obtained as the ground state, and no further\nCOO state is found. In this supercell, the X and Y points\nof the Pmca or Pmc 21 cells correspond to the \u0393 point,\nand the energy gap at the Fermi level is most narrow at\nthis symmetry point in the first Brillouin zone.\n6.

This is consistent with the\nfact that the magnetic easy axis for the high-temperature\nphase is in the h111ic direction. However, the rhombohedral distortion expected in the presence of the COO-I\nstate is not observed. Yamada et al. proposed a molecular\n\n\f14\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\npolaron model to explain the neutron diffuse scattering\nfound in the high-temperature phase.50, 51 In this model,\nthe valence fluctuation of Fe4 O4 cubic cluster is strongly\ncoupled with dynamical lattice distortion, i.e., the T2g\nmode, within the cluster. However, the local lattice distortions assumed in the model (see Fig. 1 in ref. 50) are\nthe same as those in the presence of the COO-I and COOII states as we discussed in \u00a7 5.2. Thus the diffuse scattering can be interpreted as a result of the fluctuation of the\nfictitious orbital moment on the Fe4 O4 clusters strongly\ncoupled with dynamical lattice distortion. For this reason, we consider the COO-I state remains short-range\norder in the high-temperature phase and thus no statical\nrhombohedral distortion occurs in the high-temperature\nphase.\nAs for the low-temperature phase, variety of charge\nordering model have been proposed.9, 55, 56 However, the\nNMR57 and x-ray anomalous scattering58 cast doubts\non the existence of charge ordering. Later on, moderate charge orderings with apparent local charges of\nFe2.4+ and Fe2.6+ are inferred from the x-ray and neutron\ndiffraction experiments.3, 4 The COO-IV state obtained\nfor the low-temperature phase is also accompanied by\ncharge disproportionation of Fe2.6+ and Fe2.4+ . However,\nthe pattern of charge ordering predicted from the present\ntheory is not the same to those inferred from x-ray and\nneutron diffraction experiments.\nWe have described the COO-IV state as an alternative stacking of microscopic layers of the COO-II state\nwith two different orientations. However, the state can\nalso be regarded as a COO-I state with the [111]c magnetisation direction modulated by the lattice distortion:\nthe orbital magnetisation direction is slanted from direction [111]c to [011]c in the layer 1/4 < zm < 3/4 and\ndirection [111]c to [101]c in the layer \u22121/4 < zm < 1/4.\nIndeed, the COO-IV state can even continuously transform into the COO-I state as the values of tpd is increased\nfrom tpd = 0.5 eV with V = 0 eV as demonstrated in\nFig. 12. As was discussed in \u00a7 5.2, the COO-I state is\nexpected to be accompanied by the rhombohedral cell\ndistortion. This explains why the distortion of the unit\ncell in the low-temperature phase can be approximated\nby the rhombohedral distortion.\nAs was mentioned before, the Jahn-Teller like distortions of oxygen octahedra surrounding the Fe ions at\nthe B1 sites are observed in the experiments.4 This distortion found in the low-temperature phase can be account for the presence of the COO-IV ordering as follows. The Fe ions at the B1a and B1b sites and the\nneighbouring oxygens on the zm = 1/2 plane are illustrated on the left side of Fig. 13. The Fe\u2013O bonds\nalong the x-axis are elongated, and those along the yaxis are contracted at the B1a site. The Fe\u2013O lengths\nalong the two directions are reversed at the B1b site.\nThe complex orbitals at the B1a and B1b sites are |x\u2212 i\nand |011i in the COO-IV state (see Table V) and their\nelectron clouds are stretched along the x- and y-axes, respectively. This antiferro-orbital alignment along the B1\nchain is, therefore, stabilised by the Jahn-Teller like distortion with alternative directions of the elongated Fe\u2013O\nbonds along the chain. The same holds for the B1 chains\n\nAuthor Name\n\nFig. 12. Continuous transformation of the COO-IV state (a) into\nthe COO-I state (b) with increasing value of tpd from tpd =\n0.5 eV.

Illustration of the Jahn-Teller-like distortions along the\nB1 chain at zm = 1/2 (on the left) and the B3/B4 chain at\nzm = 5/8 (on the right). The pseudo-mirror plane perpendicular\nto the am -axis presumed in the crystal structure analysis is also\nshown. The open and closed circles represent oxygen and Fe ions,\nrespectively. The arrows from Fe ions represent the elongated FeO bonds. The Jahn-Teller-like distortions along the B1 chain are\nobserved in the experiments,4 and those along the B3/B4 chain,\nwhich break the mirror symmetry, are also anticipated in the\npresence of the COO-IV state.\n\non the zm = 0 plane with the |101i/|y \u2212i antiferro-orbital\nalignment.\nThe similar antiferro-orbital alignment of |011i/|x+ i\nor |y + i/|101i are present along the B3/B4 alternative\nchains parallel to the bm -axis in the COO-IV state.\nThe alternative Jahn-Teller-like distortion is anticipated\nalong the B3/B4 chain from the theory. However, such\ndistortions are still not found in the x-ray or neutron\ndiffraction experiments. This chains are on the pseudomirror plane perpendicular to the am -axis presumed in\nthe crystal structure analysis (see Fig. 13) and search for\nsuch distortion on the B3/B4 chains can be a check for\nthe validity of the present theory.\nFrom results of the high-resolution photoemission\nspectroscopy (PES) experiments,59 the insulating gap\nwith the magnitudes \u223c 0.1 eV and \u223c 0.15 eV are inferred\nabove and below TV , respectively. Other PES experiments60 and oxygen K-edge absorption measurements61\nalso support non-closure of the gap above TV and indicate small-polaronic behaviour of charge carriers. The\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nformation of the pseudo-gap with negligible Drude weight\nin TV < T < 300 K and a clear opening of the optical gap\nof \u223c 0.14 eV below TV are observed in measurements of\nthe optical-conductivity spectra.62 The COO states obtained with the cubic structure are either a semimetal\nwith extremely low carrier density or a zero-gap semiconductor and have a pseudo-gap with the magnitude\n\u223c 0.2 eV in the vicinity of Fermi level. In addition, the\nCOO state is expected to be short-range order due to\nthe strong coupling with the dynamical lattice distortion\nin the high-temperature phase. Thus, small-polaronic or\nincoherent-metallic behaviours of the high-temperature\nphase inferred from the above experiments are consistent\nwith the present theory.\nSince the energy gap at the Fermi level is almost\nopened in these COO states obtained with the cubic\nstructure, symmetry lowering caused by the monoclinic\nlattice distortion in the low-temperature phase would result in the formation of the insulating gap. Indeed, the\nCOO-IV state has a insulating gap of \u223c 0.02 eV with the\nPmc 21 symmetry and large value of V \u223c 0.3 eV. Interestingly, the absence of the inversion symmetry leads to\nthe COO-IV state being multiferroic.45 For the Cc supercell, the band gap at the Fermi level is narrow or closed\nonly at the \u0393 point. The size of this gap might be larger,\nif the rhombohedral cell distortion in combination with\nthe Cc atomic displacements are further considered.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this paper, a spinless three-band Hubbard model for\nt2g electrons with minority spin on the B sites is investigated with the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation and\nexact diagonalisation method to discuss the electronic\nstructure and Verwey transition in magnetite.\nComplex-orbital ordered (COO) states with noncollinear orbital moments \u223c 0.4 \u03bcB are found as the\nground state with the cubic structure of the hightemperature phase when the electron hopping via adjacent O 2p orbitals is strong. Two kinds of COO states\nwith total orbital moment along directions h111ic (COOI state) and h110ic (COO-II state) are obtained. These\nstates are semimetal or zero-gap semiconductor, and\npseudo-gaps of \u223c 0.2 eV are formed near the Fermi level.\nThe formation mechanism of the COO state is discussed analytically and the stability of the state against\nthe electron correlation effects is examined with the exact\ndiagonalisation method for the 16-site system. The COO\nstate does not stem from the orbital moments induced\nby ordered spin moments via the spin-orbit interaction\nas usual magnetic materials. It is an exotic magnetic ordering within the orbital degree of freedom. The system\nof electrons with minority spin on the B sites can be\ndescribed as a fcc lattice of interacting Fe4 tetrahedral\nmolecules. From this viewpoint, the COO state originates\nfrom the formation of Hund's second rule state in spinless pseudo-d symmetry molecular orbitals on each of the\nFe4 tetrahedron and ferromagnetic alignment of their fictitious orbital moments.\nFor the low-temperature phase, the HF calculations\nwere performed with the hopping integrals evaluated\nfrom the Pmca and Pmc 21 structural models. A COO\n\nAuthor Name\n\n15\n\nstate, which can be described as an alternative stacking of microscopic layers of the COO-II states with two\ndifferent h110ic directions of the magnetisation, is obtained (COO-IV state). The state is accompanied by\nmoderate charge disproportion of Fe2.6+ and Fe2.4+ and\nin accordance with Jahn-Teller like distortion. Although\nwe used the orthorhombic atomic positions, the symmetry of the COO-IV state spontaneously lowers to the\nmonoclinic. Since the state can also be regarded as a\nmodulated COO-I state with pseudo-trigonal symmetry,\nthis explains conventional interpretation of the monoclinic distortion: combination of the rhombohedral cell\ndistortion and atomic displacements in the cell with the\northorhombic symmetry.\nFrom these findings, we interpret the Verwey transition as follows. Above TV , the COO-I state remains to\nbe short-range order impeded by dynamical lattice distortion. The strong coupling between the COO-II states\nand lattice leads to the formation of the COO-IV state\nbelow TV .\nAcknowledgment\nWe appreciate the Supercomputer Center, Institute for\nSolid State Physics, University of Tokyo, for the facilities\nand the use of the Hitachi SR11000.

The energies \u03b5(\u0393) and bases\n|\u0393, \u03b3i of these irreducible representations \u0393 are listed in\nTable A*1. There are two different basis sets for the T2 irreducible representation and here, we call them T2\u03c3 and\nT2\u03c0 . The hopping integral between them hT2\u03c3 |H|T2\u03c0 i is\nalso shown. For each of the basis sets of the three dimensional representations T1 and T2 , only one of the bases is\npresented; the other two bases, i.e., those with \u03b2 and \u03b3\nfor T1 and \u03b7 and \u03b6 for T2 , are easily obtained from the\nbases in the table by rotating \u00b12\u03c0/3 around the [111]c\naxis of the tetrahedron.\n\n1) E.
