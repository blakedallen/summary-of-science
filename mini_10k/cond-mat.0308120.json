In the\nIHM some controversy remains about the existence of Us\nand the nature of the phase for U > Uc in the case of\nabsence of a second transition. Wilkens and Martin13\nsuggested that the MI phase does not exist (the spin gap\nremains open for any finite U ). This is in contradiction\nwith the strong coupling expansion for t \u226a U \u2212 \u2206, which\nmaps the IHM onto an effective spin Hamiltonian H\u0303 with\nclosed spin gap.2,14 Wilkens and Martin13 argued that\nsince H\u0303 has an additional symmetry with respect to H\n(translation to a nearest neighbor T\u03b4 ), H\u0303 seems to have\nlost part of the physics of H, which might be essential.\nRecently, a detailed study of different observables of\nthe 1D IHM was made, using density-matrix renormalizarion group (DMRG), including a careful finite-size\nscaling analysis.19 The results indicate the present of two\ntransitions and are consistent with the phase diagram\nfound using topological transitions,9 although a smaller\nwidth of the SDI phase is suggested. Surprisingly, the\nauthors find a power law decay of charge-charge correlation functions in the MI phase, in spite of a the presence\nof a charge gap \u223c U \u2212 \u2206.\nHere I report calculations of charge expectations values, and in one dimension, the long distance behavior of\ncharge-charge and bond-bond correlation functions using\nthe mapping to a spin Hamiltonian, valid for t \u226a U \u2212 \u2206.\nThis might seem surprising at first sight, since charge\nfluctuations are frozen in H\u0303. However, the relevant information is contained in the transformed operators. This\nhas some similarities with the case of the cuprates, in\nwhich Cu and O contributions to the photoemission spectra were successfully calculated using effective one-band\nmodels.20\u201323 Also, while a t \u2212 J model is enough to explain the observed dispersion in photoemission measurements in Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 , the mapping of the operators24,25\nis crucial to explain the observed intensities.25\nThe transformation on the operators is performed in\nSection II. Section III contains the results for expectation values of different quantities, and Section IV is a\ndiscussion.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ionic Hubbard model (IHM) has been proposed\nin the 80's for the description of the neutral-ionic transition in mixed-stack charge-transfer organic crystals.1,2\nIn the 90's the interest on the model increased due to its\npotential application to ferroelectric perovskites.3\u20139 The\nmodel in any bipartite lattice can be written as:\nX\n\u2206X\nH = H 0 + H t ; H0 =\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\n(\u22121)i ni\u03c3 + U\n2 i\u03c3\ni\nX \u2020\nHt = \u2212t\nci+\u03b4\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ,\n(1)\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\nwhere i+\u03b4 denote the nearest neighbors of site i, and odd\ni correspond to the sublattice with on-site energy \u2212\u2206/2.\nAt zero temperature, in the strong coupling limit t = 0,\nthe system is in the Mott insulating (MI) phase for\nU > \u2206 (all sites are singly occupied). and in the bond\ninsulating (BI) phase for U < \u2206 (all sites with odd i\ndoubly occupied). In one dimension (1D), for finite t,\nfield theory calculations pointed out the existence of a\nthird intermediate phase, the spontaneous dimerized insulator (SDI) between the other two.8 For fixed \u2206, as\nU increases, first a transition at Uc (involving mainly\ncharge degrees of freedom) between the BI and the SDI\ntakes place, and then for Us > Uc , the spin gap closes as\nin usual Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. The physics has\nsome similarities to that of the extended Hubbard model\nfor small U and nearest-neighbor repulsion V .9\u201311\nThe phase diagram of the 1D IHM has been calculated\nnumerically using the method of jumps of Berry phases,9\nwhich in this case coincides with the method of crossings of appropriately chosen excited levels.9,10 The charge\nBerry phase is a measure of the polarization and therefore detects the ferroelectric charge transition,4\u20136 while\nthe spin Berry phase jumps at the point where the spin\ngap closes.12 For small t, Us \u2212 Uc \u223c\n= 0.6t was obtained for\nthe width of the SDI phase.9\nDue to the fact that the spin gap is exponentially small\nfor U smaller but near Us , direct numerical calculation\nof it or of appropriate correlation functions are unable\nto find a sharp transition at Us .13,14 The same difficulty\nhappens in the Hubbard chain with correlated hopping,15\n1\n\n\fcancel with P SSP are those in which ni = 0 or ni = 2\nafter the first application of S. Using Eq. (4):\n\nII. THE CANONICAL TRANSFORMATION\n\nIn this Section, I use the canonical transformation plus\nprojection onto the low-energy subspace that maps H\ninto a spin Hamiltonian H\u0303, to transform charge and bond\noperators in one direction (\u03b4 = \u00b11)\nni = ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 ,\nX \u2020\nbi =\n\u03b4(ci+\u03b4\u03c3 ci\u03c3 + H.c.),\n\n\u00132\nt\nc\u2020i\u03c3\u2032 ci+\u03b4\u03c3\u2032 c\u2020i+\u03b4\u03c3 ci\u03c3\ni\u2206\nU\n\u2212\n(\u22121)\n\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\u0012\n\u00132\nt\n+\nc\u2020i+\u03b4\u03c3 ci\u03c3 c\u2020i\u03c3\u2032 ci+\u03b4\u03c3\u2032 ]P.\n(7)\nU + (\u22121)i \u2206\n\n\u00f1i = 1 +\n\n(2)\n\nand discuss some symmetry properties. For our purposes,\nit is enough to work up to second order in t/(U \u2212 \u2206).\nThus\n1\nH\u0303 = P e\u2212S HeS P = P (H + [H, S] + [[H, S], S] + ...)P,\n2\n(3)\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\nP nj\u03c3 (1 \u2212 ni\u03c3 )P \u2212 Sj+ Si\u2212 \u2212 Sj\u2212 Si+ =\n\n1\n= \u2212 2Si * Sj .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nAnd replacing this in Eq. (7):\n\u00f1i = 1 \u2212 (\u22121)i\n\n(4)\n\n2U \u2206t2 X\n(1 \u2212 4Si * Si+\u03b4 ).\n(U 2 \u2212 \u22062 )2\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b4\n\nThis equation relates a charge operator with a purely spin\noperator. Although this might seem surprising at first\nsight, it is clear that in the strong coupling limit, virtual\ncharge fluctuations are inhibited only for a ferromagnetic\nalignment of the spins. This shows that for finite U , some\ncharge degrees of freedom remain coupled with spin, in\ncontrast to the usual Hubbard model (\u2206 = 0).\nUsing Eq. (2), to leading order in t, the transformed\nbond operator is:\n\nwhere Ej is the energy of the eigenstate |ji of H0 . From\nEqs. (3) and (4), proceeding in a similar way as done\nbelow, one obtains the known result:2\nX\n4t2 U\n1\n(Si * Sj \u2212 ).\n2\n2\n(U \u2212 \u2206 )\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\nwhere P is the projector over the ground state subspace\nof H0 , in which ni \u2261 1 for all i, and S is chosen in\nsuch a way that linear terms in the hopping term Ht are\neliminated: Ht + [H0 , S] = 0. Taking matrix elements of\nthis equation between eigenstates of H0 , one obtains:\n\nH\u0303 =\n\nP [\u2212\n\nThe first (negative) term correspond to charge ni = 0\nin the intermediate state and the excitation energy is\nEn \u2212 Em = U + (\u22121)i+\u03b4 \u2206/2 \u2212 (\u22121)i \u2206/2 = U \u2212 (\u22121)i \u2206.\nThe sums over spins can be transformed as follows:\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nP cj\u03c3 ci\u03c3 c\u2020i\u03c3\u2032 cj\u03c3\u2032 P =\nP cj\u03c3 cj\u03c3\u2032 (\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u2212 c\u2020i\u03c3\u2032 ci\u03c3 )P\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\nhn|Ht |mi\nhn|S|mi =\n,\nEm \u2212 En\n\nX\n\n(5)\n\nhiji\n\nThe most important correction to H\u0303 in higher order is a\nnext-nearest-neighbor exchange of order t4 , which does\nnot affect the physics for t \u226a U \u2212 \u2206.2,14\nThe effective Hamiltonian H\u0303 to all orders in t is invariant under a nearest-neighbor translation T\u03b4 , while H\nis not.2 This is simply a consequence of the fact that\nto all orders H\u0303 is a purely spin Hamiltonian, since the\ncharge degrees of freedom are frozen (ni \u2261 1 for all i).\nThen H\u0303 is invariant under the electron-hole transformation Teh : c\u2020i\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3ci\u03c3\u0304 , which leaves invariant all spin\noperators. Since the original Hamiltonian H is invariant\nunder the product T\u03b4 Teh , then H\u0303 should also be invariant under T\u03b4 . However other transformed operators, like\n\u00f1i below, are not invariant under T\u03b4 .\nThe transformed charge operator is:\n\nb\u0303i = P e\u2212S bi eS P \u223c\n= P [bi , S]P\nX\nt\n\u2032\nc\u2020 c c\u2020 c\n=\n\u03b4P [\ni \u2206 i+\u03b4\u03c3 i\u03c3 i\u03c3\u2032 i+\u03b4\u03c3\nU\n+\n(\u22121)\n\u2032\n\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\n\n+\n\nt\nc\u2020 \u2032 ci+\u03b4\u03c3\u2032 c\u2020i+\u03b4\u03c3 ci\u03c3 + H.c.]P.\nU \u2212 (\u22121)i \u2206 i\u03c3\n\nThe first term correspond to acting first with S creating\nan excitation with a doubly occupied site at i, and an\nempty site at i+\u03b4, and then with bi , restoring occupation\n1 at each site.

DISCUSSION\n\nI have calculated several quantities of the ionic Hubbard model, using a mapping to a spin Hamiltonian valid\nfor U > \u2206 and t \u226a U \u2212 \u2206. In this limit the system is\nexpected to be in the MI phase. This is predicted to be\nthe case in 1D,8,9 and in fact the absence of a spin gap\nin the effective transformed Hamiltonian H\u0303 is consistent\nwith this.2,14 Also, the bond-bond correlation functions\ndecay faster than the spin-spin ones at large distances,\nin contrast to what is expected in the SDI.\nBy construction, the symmetry of the observables is\nindependent of the basis in which they are calculated,\nand this becomes clear after transformation of the operators. For example, the charge operator ni is invariant\nunder translation of one lattice parameter T\u03b4 , while H\nis not. These symmetry properties are interchanged in\nthe transformed operators \u00f1i and H\u0303, and the expectation value hni iH = h\u00f1i iH\u0303 is not invariant under T\u03b4 . As\na consequence, for any finite U there is a charge density wave. Its amplitude for t \u226a U \u2212 \u2206 is proportional\nto t2 \u2206U/(U 2 \u2212 \u22062 )2 but with a coefficient larger than\n20 which depends on dimension, and is near 53 in three\ndimensions.\nThe charge-charge correlation functions in 1D decay as\nd\u22123 ln\u22123/2 d as a function of distance d for large d with\na prefactor proportional to t4 \u22062 , in excelent agreement\nwith recent DMRG calculations.19 This result for a finite\ncharge gap, is in marked contrast to the general behavior\nfound in 1D systems and is a consequence of the fact that\ncoupling between charge and spin dynamics remains at\nlow energies in the original basis (effective dressed charge\nand spin fields are separated at low energies). This fact\nis at variance with the low-energy spin-charge separation\nthat takes place in translationally invariant models with\nquite general nearest-neighbor interactions17 (including\nthe extended Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor repulsion V 10,11 and the Hubbard model with correlated\nhopping10,16,17 ). An important difference is that in weak\ncoupling the charge-spin interaction is a relevant operator in the IHM.14\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI am indebted to R. Noack, A. Dobry and G.
