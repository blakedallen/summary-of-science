This article summarises the status of the solar neutrino oscillation phenomenology at\nthe end of 2002 in the light of the SNO and KamLAND results. We first present the allowed areas\nobtained from global solar analysis and demonstrate the preference of the solar data towards the\nLarge-Mixing-Angle (LMA) MSW solution. A clear confirmation in favor of the LMA solution\ncomes from the KamLAND reactor neutrino data. The KamLAND spectral data in conjunction with\nthe global solar data further narrows down the allowed LMA region and splits it into two allowed\nzones \u2013 a low \u2206m2 region (low-LMA) and high \u2206m2 region (high-LMA).

The Neutrinos from the sun\nSolar neutrinos are produced via the reaction\n4p \u21924 He + 2e+ + 2\u03bde + 28MeV\n\n(1)\n\nThe above process occurs through two main cycles of nuclear reactions \u2013 the pp chain\n(CNO cycle) which is responsible for 98.5% (1.5%) of the energy. There are eight different types of neutrino fluxes, named according to the parent nuclei of the decay chain\nwhich generates it. The pp chain gives rise to the neutrinos pp, pep, hep, 7 Be, 8 B\nwhile the neutrinos 13 N , 15 O,17 F are generated through nuclear reactions forming the\nCNO cycle. The solar neutrino fluxes are calculated by the so called \"Standard Solar Models\" (SSM) among which the most extensively used are the ones due to Bahcall and his\ncollaborators [1]. The flux predictions from the SSM are robust. Different solar models\nagree to a very high degree of accuracy ( to within 10%) when the same input values of\nthe parameters are used and also demonstrate striking consistency with helioseismological\nmeasurements. The pp neutrinos are mainly responsible for solar luminosity and the SSM\nprediction for the pp flux is least uncertain. The prediction for the 8 B neutrino flux is most\nuncertain stemming from the uncertainties associated with the cross-section of the reaction\n7\nBe(p\u03b3)8 B producing these neutrinos.\n\n1\n\n\f2. Solar Neutrino Experiments\nThe pioneering experiment for the detection of solar neutrinos is the 37 Cl experiment in\nHomestake which started operation in 1968 1 . It utilises the reaction [4]\n\u03bde +37 Cl \u219237 Ar + e\u2212 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe threshold for this is 0.814 MeV and hence it is sensitive to the 8 B and 7 Be neutrinos.\nThree experiments SAGE in Russia and GALLEX and its updated version GNO in GranSasso Underground laboratory in Italy uses the reaction [5]\n\u03bde +\n\n71\n\nGa \u2192\n\n71\n\nGe + e\u2212\n\n(3)\n\nfor detecting the solar neutrinos. This reaction has a low threshold of 0.233 MeV and the\ndetectors are sensitive to the basic pp neutrinos.\nThe radio chemical experiments 37 Cl and 71 Ga experiments are sensitive to only \u03bde and\ncan provide the total solar \u03bde flux.\nThe first real time measurement of the solar neutrino flux was done by the Kamiokande\nimaging water C\u0306erenkov detector, located in the Kamioka mine in Japan [6]. It was subsequently upgraded to SuperKamiokande \u2013 a same type of detector but with much larger\nvolume increasing the statistics [7]. The neutrinos interact with the electrons in the water\nvia\ne \u2212 + \u03bdx \u2192 e \u2212 + \u03bdx\n\n(4)\n\nThis reaction is sensitive to all the three neutrino flavours. However the \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 react\nvia the neutral current which is suppressed by a factor of 1/6 compared to the \u03bde interaction which can be mediated by both charged and neutral currents. The recoil electron\nenergy threshold in Kamiokande was 7.5 MeV which could be reduced to 5 MeV in SuperKamiokande. Thus both the detectors are sensitive mainly to the 8 B neutrinos.\nThe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment also uses a C\u0306erenkov detector but\ncontaining heavy water (D2 O). The deuterium in heavy water makes it possible to observe\nsolar neutrinos in three different reaction channels [8,9]\n\u03bde + d \u2192 p + p + e \u2212\n\n(CC)\n\n\u03bdx + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bdx + e \u2212\n\n(ES)\n\n\u03bdx + d \u2192 n + p + \u03bdx\n\n(NC)\n\nThe charged current (CC) reaction is exclusive for \u03bde , The electron scattering (ES) reaction\nis same as in SK. The unique feature of SNO is the neutral current (NC) reaction which\nis sensitive to all the three flavours with equal strength. For both CC and ES reactions\nthe final state electrons are directly detected through the C\u0306erenkov light emitted by them\nwhich hits the PMTs and an event is recorded. For the NC reactions the final state neutron\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFor recent reviews on solar neutrino experiments see [2,3].\n\n\fcan be captured (i) by another deuteron (ii)by capture on Cl in an NaCl enriched heavy\nwater (iii)by 3 He proportional counters. For both (i) and (ii) the nuclei after capturing the\nneutrons emits single and multiple gamma rays respectively which compton scatters the\nelectrons in the medium. The C\u0306erenkov light produced by these electrons will produce\nan event. Therefore if the NC events are due to (i) and (ii) above then they cannot be\ndisentangled from the CC and ES events Exclusive detection of the neutrons produced in\nthe NC event is possible for the process (iii).\n\n2.1 The total solar neutrino flux\nThe ratio of the observed solar neutrino rates to the SSM predictions are presented below.\nexperiment\nCl\nGa\nSK\nSNO(CC)\nSNO(ES)\nSNO(NC)\n\nobsvd\nBP B00\n\n0.337 \u00b1 0.029\n0.553 \u00b1 0.034\n0.465 \u00b1 0.014\n0.349 \u00b1 0.021\n0.473 \u00b1 0.074\n1.008 \u00b1 0.123\n\nThe declared SNO NC data is due to neutron capture on deuteron. Therefore the CC,ES\nand NC events cannot be separated on an event by event basis. For extracting the separate\nrates from the entangled data sample one one needs to assume an undistorted 8 B flux as an\ninput. The SNO rates quoted in the above Table are obtained under this assumption [9]. In\nall the above experiments observed \u03bde flux is less than the theoretical predictions implying\ndisappearance of the solar \u03bde s. On the other hand for the SNO NC data the observed rate\nagrees to the theoretical prediction. Since the NC is sensitive to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 as well this\nindicates that the \u03bde s are reappearing as \u03bd\u03bc s and/or \u03bd\u03c4 s.\n2.2 Information on Direction and Energy\nApart from providing a measurement for the total solar neutrino flux the real time measurements can also provide information on direction and energy of the incoming neutrinos. The\nelectron scattering reaction used in SK and SNO has excellent directional sensitivity. In\nfact through this reaction the Kamiokande experiment first demonstrated the solar origin of\nthe neutrinos. The left panel in figure 1 plots the number of events observed in SK against\nthe cosine of the angle with the sun's direction. There is a clear peaking towards cos \u03b8\u2299\n= 1.0 [10]. The statistical capacity of SK allows it to make an energy wise binning of the\ndata and present the recoil electron energy spectrum. The right panel in figure 1 shows\nthe data/SSM as a function of the recoil electron energy with a 5 MeV threshold. The plot\nexhibits a flat recoil electron energy spectrum consistent with no spectral distortion [10].\nThe panels 1 and 3 in Figure 2 show the number of CC+ES+NC+background events\nin SNO as a function of direction and energy respectively. The solid lines in the figures\nshow the Montecarlo simulated CC,ES and NC events. The ES events show the strong\ndirectional correlation with sun as in SK.

These\nprobability density functions are used to perform a maximum likelihood fit to the data.\n\n4\n\n\f2.3 Variations with time\nSK already has enough statistics to divide their data into both energy and zenith angle bins.\nThe latest SK data has been presented with a binning of eighth energy bins and each energy\nbin contains data subdivided into seven zenith angle bins. [11]. This binning enables one to\nmeasure the day time and night time fluxes separately and study for any possible day/night\nasymmetry. Since in day time the neutrinos do not pass through the earths matter and in\nnight time they traverse the earths matter an observed day/night asymmetry would be clear\nindicator of earths matter effect modifying the neutrino fluxes. The day/night asymmetry\nmeasured in SK and SNO are still not at a statistically significant level.\n\n2.4 Evolution of the solar neutrino problem\nBefore the declaration of the SNO data there were two aspects of the solar neutrino problem. The first one is \u2013 in all the experiments the observed flux was less than SSM prediction. The second one was the 'problem of the 7 Be neutrinos'. We note that among the\npre-SNO experiments SK and its predecessor Kamiokande is sensitive to the 8 B neutrinos.\nThe 37 Cl experiment is sensitive mainly to the 8 B and 7 Be neutrinos while the sensitivity\nof the 71 Ga experiments amount to pp, 8 B and 7 Be neutrinos. Combining the 8 B flux\nmeasured in SK with the Cl data resulted in no room for the 7 Be neutrinos. Similarly\nthe expected pp flux in Ga consistent with solar luminosity plus the 8 B flux observed in\nSK indicated a negative flux of 7 Be neutrinos in Ga. The solar physics could not explain\nthis preferential vanishing of 7 Be flux over 8 B flux as in the pp chain 7 Be comes before\n8\nB and any mechanism that reduces the 7 Be flux would eventually reduce the 8 B flux.\nTherefore the answer was sought in the properties of neutrinos and neutrino flavour conversion was considered as the most promising candidate for the solution. SNO provided\nthe compelling evidence.\nThe SNO CC reaction is sensitive only to \u03bde while the ES reaction in both SK and SNO\nis sensitive to both \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bd\u03c4 . Therefore a higher ES flux as compared to the CC flux\nwill imply the presence of \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bd\u03c4 in the solar \u03bde flux. Combining the SK ES and SNO CC\nresults one gets\nSN O\n6\n2\n\u03c6SK\nES \u2212 \u03c6CC = 0.57 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 10 /cm /sec\n\n(5)\n\nThis is a 3.3\u03c3 signal for \u03bde transition to an active flavour (or against \u03bde transition to solely\na sterile state).\nThe NC reaction is sensitive to all the three flavours with equal strength resulting in a\ngreater sensitivity to the neutral current component in the solar \u03bde flux. Comparing the NC\nand CC data from SNO one gets\nO\nSN O\n6\n2\n\u03c6SN\nN C \u2212 \u03c6CC = 3.41 \u00b1 0.65 \u00d7 10 /cm /sec\n\n(6)\n\nIn two circumstances we can have the CC and NC rates equal to each other. Either when\nthere is no flavour conversion or for flavour conversion to a purely sterile state which\ndoes not interact with the detector. The observed CC/NC difference rules out both these\npossibilities at 5.3\u03c3.\n\n5\n\n\f3. Two Flavour Oscillation\nIf neutrinos have mass then the flavour eigenstates \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bd\u03c4 are different from the\nmass eigenstates \u03bd1 ,\u03bd2 and related as\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u03bde\n\u03bd1\ncos \u03b8\nsin \u03b8\n=\n(7)\n\u03bdx\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\u03bd2\nwhere \u03b8 is the mixing angle in vacuum. This leads to neutrino oscillation in vacuum [12].\nThen the survival probability that a \u03bde remains \u03bde after traveling distance L in vacuum is\nP\u03bde \u03bde = 1 \u2212 sin 2 2\u03b8 sin 2 (1.27\u2206m2 L/E)\n\n(8)\n\n\u2206m2 = m22 \u2212 m21 . The term containing \u2206m2 is the oscillatory term resulting from coherent propagation of the mass eigenstates.\nIn matter, only \u03bde 's undergoes\n\u221a Charged current interaction giving rise to an matter induced mass term of the form 2GF Ne . This changes the mixing angles as\ntan 2\u03b8M =\n\n\u2206m2 sin 2\u03b8\n\u221a\n\u2206m2 cos 2\u03b8 \u2212 2 2GF ne E\n\n(9)\n\nne is the electron density of the medium and E is the neutrino energy. Eq. (9) demonstrates\nthe resonant behavior of \u03b8M . Assuming \u2206m2 > 0 the mixing angle in matter is maximal\n(irrespective of the value of mixing angle in vacuum) for an electron density satisfying,\n\u221a\n2 2GF ne,res E = \u2206m2 cos 2\u03b8\n(10)\nThis is the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect of matter-enhanced resonant flavor conversion [13].\nThe most general expression for \u03bde survival probability in an unified formalism over the\nmass range 10\u221212 \u2212 10\u22123 eV2 and for the mixing angle \u03b8 in the range [0,\u03c0/2] is [14]\nPee = P\u2299 P\u2295 + (1 \u2212 P\u2299 )(1 \u2212 P\u2295 )\np\n+2 P\u2299 (1 \u2212 P\u2299 )P\u2295 (1 \u2212 P\u2295 ) cos \u03be\n\n(11)\n\nwhere P\u2299 denotes the probability of conversion of \u03bde to one of the mass eigenstates in the\nsun and P\u2295 gives the conversion probability of the mass eigenstate back to the \u03bde state in\nthe earth. All the phases involved in the Sun, vacuum and inside Earth are included in \u03be.\nDepending on the value of \u2206m2 /E one has the following three limits\n<\n(i)in the regime \u2206m2 /E \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 eV2 /MeV matter effects inside the Sun suppress\nflavor transitions while the effect of the phase \u03be remains. This is the vacuum oscillation\nlimit.\n>\n(ii)For \u2206m2 /E \u223c 10\u22128 eV2 /MeV, the total oscillation phase becomes very large and\nthe cos \u03be term in Eq. (11) averages out to zero signifying incoherent propagation of the\nneutrino mass eigenstates. This is the MSW limit.\n<\n>\n(iii)For 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 eV2 /MeV \u223c \u2206m2 /E \u223c 10\u22128 eV2 /MeV, both matter effects inside the\nSun and coherent oscillation effects in the vacuum become important. This is the quasi\nvacuum oscillation (QVO) regime.\n6\n\n\f-3\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\nCl+Ga+SK+SNO CC rates\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n\u2206m (eV )\n\n10\n2\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2206m (eV )\n\nCl+Ga+SK+SNO CC+SNO ES rates\n+ SK D-N spectra + SNO CC spectra\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n90% C.L.\n95% C.L.\n99% C.L.\n99.73% C.L.\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n90% C.L.\n95% C.L.\n99% C.L.\n99.73% C.L.\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n2\n\ntan \u03b8\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\ntan \u03b8\n\nFigure 3. The allowed regions in \u2206m2 -tan2 \u03b8 plane from data on total solar rates in\nthe left panel and from data on total solar rates and SK spectrum data in right panel.\n\nNext we present the results obtained by performing a \u03c72 -analysis of the solar neutrino\ndata. The procedure followed can be found in [15\u201317]. In figure 3 we present the allowed regions obtained from analysis including the total fluxes measured in Cl, Ga, SK\nand SNO [17]. There are basically five regions which are allowed \u2013 the small mixing angle\nregion (SMA), the large mixing angle high \u2206m2 regions (LMA), the large mixing anglelow \u2206m2 regions (LOW), the vacuum oscillation regions symmetric about tan2 \u03b8 = 1.0\nand the quasi vacuum region between the LOW and the vacuum oscillation regions.\nIn the scond panel of figure 3 we present the allowed areas after including the SK spectrum data with the total rates data [17]. The SMA region and large part of the vacuum\noscillation region are seen to have been washed away with the inclusion of the SK spectrum data.\nIn the left panel of fig. 4 we show the dependence of the probabilities on energy. In the\nSMA and the VO oscillation regions the probability has a non-monotonic dependence on\nenergy whereas in the LMA and LOW regions the survival probability does not have any\nappreciable dependence on energy beyond 5 MeV which is the threshold for SK and SNO.\nThus these regions are favoured by the flat SK spectrum.\nIn the right panel of figure 4 ( from [18]) we present the allowed regions obtained from an\nglobal \u03c72 analysis [18\u201321] of the total rates observed in Cl and Ga (SAGE, GALLEX and\nGNO combined rate), the 1496 day SK zenith angle energy spectrum data and the recent\nSNO data of combined CC+ES+NC+background data in 17 day and 17 night energy bin.\nAfter the inclusion of the SNO results\n(i) LMA emerges as the favoured solution.\n(ii) The LOW region now appears only at 3\u03c3.\n(iii)Values of \u2206m2 above 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2 are seen to be disfavored.\n7\n\n\f1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n1\n\n-3\n10\n-3\n\nLOW\n\nLMA\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\nVO\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\nSMA\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n\u2206 m (in eV )\n\nsurvival probability\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.6\n-9\n\n-9\n\n10\n0.4\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n90% C.L.\n95% C.L.\n99% C.L.\n99.73% C.L.\n\n-10\n\n10\n\navarage\nday\nnight\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n-11\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10 -3\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n15\n\nE (in MeV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n20\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n10\n\n2\n\ntan \u03b8\n\nFigure 4.

The data reveal a flat zenith angle spectrum. The inclusion of\nthis data rule out the higher part of the LOW solution beyond 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 eV2 for which\npeaks in the zenith-angle spectrum are expected [22].\n\n4. KamLAND\nKamLAND is a 1000 ton liquid scintillator neutrino detector situated at the former site\nof Kamiokande [23]. It looks for \u03bd \u0304e oscillation coming from 16 reactors at distances 81\n- 824 km. Most powerful reactors are at a distance \u223c 180 km. The detection process is\n\u03bd \u0304e p \u2192 e+ n. The e+ produced annihilates with the electrons in the medium to produce\nprompt photons. The neutrons get absorbed by the protons in the medium to produce delayed photons. The correlation of time,position and energy between these two constitute\na grossly background free signal. The survival probability relevant in KamLAND is the\nvacuum survival probability (cf. eq. 8) summed over the distances from all the reactors.\nThe average energy and length scales for KamLAND are E\u03bd \u223c 3 MeV, L \u223c 1.8 \u00d7105 m\nwhich makes it sensitive to \u2206m2 \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 which is in the LMA region. The\nfigure 5 shows the probabilities for KamLAND for the average distance of 180 km and\nsolar neutrinos for \u2206m2 (=6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ) and tan2 \u03b8 (=0.5) [24]. Whereas for the solar\n8\n\n\fprobabilities the \u2206m2 dependence is completely averaged out in KamLAND the probability exhibits a L/E dependence which gives it an unprecedented sensitivity to determine\n\u2206m2 .\n1\n-3\n\n10\n\n0.9\n0.8\n2\n\n\u2206m /eV\n\nPee\n\n0.7\n\n2\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\n0\n\nE (MeV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n2\n\ntan \u03b8\n\nFigure 5. The left figure shows the variation of the survival probability with energy\nfor KamLAND and for the solar neutrinos. The right figure gives the allowed region\nfrom an analysis of KamLAND rate and global solar data. The allowed region from\nonly solar analysis is shown also by the outer dashed line.\n\nThe solar best-fit predicts a rate in KamLAND 0.65+0.08\n\u22120.39 (3\u03c3) [25] while the observed\nrate is 0.611 \u00b1 0.094 corresponding to 145 days of data. Thus KamLAND confirms the\nLMA solution. In figure 5 we show the allowed area obtained from a \u03c72 -analysis of KamLAND rates data and global solar data [26]. The contour obtained from only solar analysis\nis also drawn (dashed lines) for understanding the role played by KamLAND . The inclusion of the KamLAND rates data gives a lower bound of \u2206m2 > 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 . The other\nparts of the parameter space allowed from the solar analysis are not constrained much.\nFigure 6 shows the allowed areas obtained from a \u03c72 analysis of the only KamLAND spectrum [23]. For an average energy of 5 MeV and a distance 180 km a \u2206m2 of\n7 \u00d7 10\u2212 5 eV2 corresponds to the oscillation wavelength (\u03bb) \u223c the distance traveled(L)\nand Pee \u2248 1, for \u2206m2 of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 \u03bb = 2L and Pee = 0.0. Again for \u2206m2 =\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2 \u03bb = L/2 and Pee = 1. Since the KamLAND spectral data corresponds to\na peak around 5 MeV islands around the first and the third \u2206m2 are allowed whereas the\nmiddle \u2206m2 is disfavoured as is seen from the panel 1 of figure 6.\nIn the second panel of figure 6 we show the allowed area from KamLAND spectrum and\nglobal solar data obtained through a \u03c72 analysis [26]. Inclusion of the KamLAND spectral\ndata splits the allowed region into two zones at 99% C.L. low-LMA (LMA1) and highLMA (LMA2). LMA2 has less statistical significance (by \u2248 2\u03c3) The global best-fit comes\nat \u2206m2 = 7.17\u00d710\u22125 eV2 and tan2 \u03b8 = 0.44 in low-LMA. LOW region is disfavoured at\n5\u03c3. Maximal mixing although allowed by the KamLAND spectrum data gets disfavoured\nat 3.4\u03c3 by the overall analysis.\nIn the left panel of figure 7 we explore through a projected analysis of 1 kton year\nsimulated spectrum the potential of KamLAND in distinguishing between the two allowed\nareas.\nThe allowed \u2206m2 ranges around both low-LMA and high-LMA zones decrease in size.\nSince the solar data favours the low-LMA zone the allowed areas become more precise for\nspectrum simulated at the low-LMA zone while ambiguity between the two zones remains\nfor high-LMA spectrum. In the right panel of 7 we show that a higher statistics (3 kton\nyear) from KamLAND can remove this ambiguity almost completely determining \u2206m2 to\n9\n\n\f-4\n2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n2\n\n\u2206m /eV\n\n2\n\n\u2206 m 2 (eV )\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nRate excluded\nRate+Shape allowed\nLMA\nPalo Verde excluded\nChooz excluded\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nsin 2 \u03b8\n2\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\ntan \u03b8\n\nFigure 6.

The right panel shows the allowed region from\na global analysis of KamLAND spectrum and solar neutrino data.\n\nwithin 6%.\nAnalysis of solar and KamLAND data has been done in the realistic three neutrino scenario in [27]. In this case the non-zero value of the mixing angle \u03b813 2 connecting the\natmospheric sector and the solar sector modifies the allowed area in \u2206m2 \u2212 tan2 \u03b8 parameter space. A third solution at a \u2206m2 higher than the high-LMA zone gets marginally\nallowed for the three flavour case. As \u03b813 is increased the high-LMA zones tend to disappear.\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe solar neutrino research began with a motivation of understanding the sun through the\nneutrino channel. Over the years it metamorphosed into a tool of unraveling the fundamental properties of the neutrinos.

Even before that a day-night asymmetry > 1% in SNO can exclude LMA2 [28]. However the constraining power of KamLAND for \u03b8 is not as good\nbeing limited by the 6% systematic error and also by the fact that in the statistically significant regions the observed KamLAND spectrum corresponds to a peak in the survival\nprobability where the \u03b8 sensitivity is very low. At the present value of the best-fit parameters in the low-LMA region a new KamLAND like reactor experiment with a baseline of\n\u223c 70 km will be sensitive to the the minimum in the survival probability increasing the \u03b8\nsensitivity by a large amount [29]. The upcoming Borexino experiment should see a rate\n0.64 \u00b1 0.03 (1\u03c3) and no day-night asymmetry. It cannot differentiate between the two\nLMA regions. However it can provide a measurement of the 7 Be flux coming from the\nsun. Real time measurement of the pp neutrino flux is the target of the so called \"LowNU\"\nexperiments like XMASS, HELLAZ, HERON. CLEAN, MUNU, GENIUS using \u03bd \u2212 e\nscattering and LENS, MOON and SIREN using charged current reactions [30]. All these\nexperiments involve development of new and challenging experimental concepts and research work is in progress for evolving these techniques.\n\n11\n\n\fI acknowledge my collaborators A.
