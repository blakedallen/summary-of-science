Precise observations of the transit light curve reveal the\nplanetary radius and allow a search for timing anomalies caused by satellites or\nadditional planets. Precise measurements of the stellar Doppler shift throughout\na transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) place a lower bound on the stellar\nobliquity, which may be indicative of the planet's migration history. I review\nrecent results of the Transit Light Curve project, and of a parallel effort to\nmeasure the Rossiter effect for many of the known transiting planets.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI have great admiration for the people who discover transiting planets. Identifying the candidate transit signals from among a hundred thousand light curves,\nand flushing out the numerous astrophysical false positives, are impressive feats.\nThis article, however, is not about transit discovery, but rather about the next\nstep: performing high-precision photometry and spectroscopy of exoplanetary\ntransits. The goal of this step is to determine the planetary and stellar properties well enough to allow for meaningful comparisons with the familiar properties\nof the Solar system, and to inform our theories of planet formation.\nThe most immediate result of transit photometry is a measurement of the\nplanetary radius. In combination with the planetary mass, which can be inferred\nfrom the Doppler orbit of the star, these data give the first clues about the composition, interior structure, and atmospheric energy balance of the planet. An\naccurate radius is also needed to interpret the results of other observations, such\nas the detection of thermal emission or reflected light based on secondary-transit\nphotometry. The timings of the transits can be used to refine the measurement\nof the orbital period and search for additional bodies in the system. In \u00a7 2, I describe the Transit Light Curve (TLC) project, an effort to gather high-precision\nphotometry during exoplanetary transits.\nThe most prominent spectroscopic signal during a transit is the RossiterMcLaughlin (RM) effect. This effect is an anomalous Doppler shift that arises\nfrom stellar rotation. Measuring this effect allows one to assess the alignment between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar spin axis, a fundamental system\nproperty that provides clues about the process of planet migration. I describe\nsome recent measurements of the RM effect in \u00a7 3.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. The Transit Light Curve project. Each panel shows timebinned photometry from a campaign (2-5 separate transits) for a particular\nplanet. Most of the data are z band observations with the FLWO 1.2m\ntelescope and Keplercam detector.\n\n2.\n\nThe Transit Light Curve project\n\nThe most spectacular transit light curves have come from space-based observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (Brown et al. 2001, Pont et al. 2007)\nand the Spitzer Space Telescope (Knutson et al. 2007). However, it is important to remember that the extreme precision with which the relative flux can\nbe recorded (\u223c104 per 30 s sample) does not guarantee an extremely precise\nvalue for the planetary radius. Rather, the transit depth \u2206F \u2248 (Rp /R\u22c6 )2 is\nknown precisely, but Rp is known only as well as R\u22c6 . The stellar radius must\nbe estimated using other observable properties of the star, such as its parallax,\nluminosity, angular diameter, or spectrum.\n\n\f3\nActually the situation is slightly more complex. In addition to the transit\ndepth, precise photometry provides a few other observables, among which are the\nphotometric period P , the total transit duration tT (from first to fourth contact),\nand the full transit duration tF (from second to third contact). Kepler's third\nlaw can be used to write an accurate expression for the mean stellar density in\nterms of observable quantities (Seager & Mallen-Ornelas 2003):\n\u03c1\u22c6 =\n\n32\n\u2206F 3/4\nP 2\nG\u03c0\n(tT \u2212 t2F )3/2\n\n(1)\n\nThis approximation assumes Mp \u226a M\u22c6 , Rp \u226a R\u22c6 \u226a a, and a circular orbit,\nbut it is straightforward to generalize this expression. Thus, precise photometry\nreveals the mean stellar density.\nThis is helpful because it means that the light curve itself helps to estimate\nthe stellar radius. A traditional method for estimating the stellar radius is to\ncompare the spectroscopic values of Teff , log g, and metallicity with the output\nof theoretical models of stellar evolution. With excellent transit photometry it\nis advantageous to use \u03c1\u22c6 instead of log g (see, e.g., Sozzetti et al. 2007, Holman\net al. 2007). A related point is that in some regions of the HR diagram, the\nstellar mass is constrained at least as well as the stellar radius. At fixed stellar\ndensity-that is, with a perfect transit light curve-the error in R\u22c6 (and hence\nRp ) varies only as the cube root of M\u22c6 . In such cases the systematic error in Rp\nwould be reduced by a factor of three relative to a situation in which only the\ntransit depth (and not the durations) were known.\nAnother quantity that can be written purely in terms of observables is\nthe planetary surface gravity (Southworth et al. 2007). In this sense, what a\ntransit observer really measures is the stellar mean density and the planetary\nsurface gravity. Transforming these variables into Rp and Mp requires external\ninformation.\nIn 2006, Matt Holman and I wondered whether it would be possible to\nreach the limiting precision in Rp by combining the results of repeated groundbased observations. We began the Transit Light Curve (TLC) project, with\nthe aim of building a library of transit photometry of uniformly high quality,\nalong with unified and rigorous methods for parameter determination. Our\nworkhorse is the Fred L. Whipple 1.2m telescope and Keplercam detector. We\nhave also used the 6.5m Magellan telescopes for the OGLE systems, which are\nboth southerly and faint. We have found that by employing these instruments\nand some straightforward observing protocols, it is possible in some cases to\nreach the limit in which the error in Rp is dominated by the uncertainties in the\nstellar properties rather than the photometric uncertainties.\nAmong our observing protocols are the following. When possible we center\nthe field in such a way as to encompass at least 5 comparison stars of similar\nbrightness to the target star. We keep the image registration as consistent as\npossible throughout the night. We defocus, if needed, to broaden the pointspread function to a consistent width of 5-7 pixels; this often has the salutary\neffect of enhancing the duty cycle by lengthening the maxmimum exposure time.\nWe ensure that the flat-field calibration frame has enough counts to correct\nfor \u223c0.1% pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations. We observe not only the entire\ntransit but also at least 1 hr prior to ingress and 1 hr after egress. We use the\n\n\f4\nreddest available optical bandpass (often Sloan z), for two reasons: to minimize\nthe effect of differential extinction on the relative photometry, and to minimize\nthe effect of limb darkening on the transit light curve.\nFigure 1 is a gallery of some of our composite light curves, along with the\nstandard deviation of the noise and citations to published results. Figure 2\nshows the favorable noise characteristics that we have found for a subset of our\ntarget systems. Naturally, the best results are obtained when the field of view\noffers numerous good comparison stars and when the sky conditions are pristine.\n(Even relative photometry benefits from \"photometric\" nights.) A photometric\nprecision of 0.15% with 30-second sampling is typical.\n\nFigure 2. Photometry of TrES-1 and TrES-3, after subtracting the bestfitting model. The left panels show the residuals as a function of time. The\nright panels show the standard deviation of the binned residuals, as a function of the bin size. For these systems the noise varies as N \u22121/2 as one would\nexpect for uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The data sets exhibiting these favorable characteristics generally come from observations on photometric nights\nof systems for which 5 or more good comparison stars are available.\n\nWe have written a comprehensive analysis code that simultaneously fits\nmultiple transits observed in different bandpasses, secondary transits (when such\ndata are available), and radial velocities (including the Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffect; see \u00a7 3). We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate\nthe joint a posteriori probability distribution for all relevant parameters. Going\nforward, we intend to make some potentially important improvements to the\ncode, including a more sophisticated treatment of \"red noise\" employing a model\nof the covariance matrix (at the moment we use a crude approxmation), and a\nprincipal-component decomposition of the limb darkening function.\n\n\f5\nOver the longer term, we hope to detect (or rule out) additional planets\nand satellites of the transiting planet. These may manifest themselves through\ngradual changes in the transit duration caused by orbital precession (MiraldaEscud\u00e9 2002, Heyl & Gladman 2007) and by short-term variations in the midtransit times due to multi-Keplerian motions or mutual gravitational interactions. We are gathering a large number of transit times with a precision of\n0.25-1 min. Holman & Murray (2005) and Agol et al. (2005) have shown that\ntransit-timing variations of that order could be produced by perturbers as small\nas the Earth, as long as they are in mean-motion resonances with the transiting planet. Resonances might be a common outcome of planet formation and\nmigration, and searching for transit-timing variations is one way to find out.\n\n3.\n\nThe Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect\n\nA striking pattern in the Solar system is its coplanarity. The orbital axes of\nthe 8 planets line up to within a few degrees, and the Sun's spin axis differs\nby only 7 degrees from the Earth's orbital axis. The observed coplanarity was\nthe original inspiration for the theory that the Sun and planets condensed from\na single spinning disk. It would be interesting to know whether this degree of\nalignment is typical of all planetary systems. Exoplanets have provided enough\nsurprises that nothing should be taken for granted.\nIndeed there are reasons to expect at least occasional misalignments. Among\nthe surprises to which I just alluded is that planetary orbital eccentricities are\noften large; whatever mechanism perturbs orbital eccentricities may also perturb inclinations. For close-in planets, which are thought to have formed at\nlarge orbital distances and then migrated inward, one may wonder whether the\nmigration process disturbed the original alignment. The various migration theories differ on this point. Migration via tidal interactions with the protoplanetary\ndisk should not perturb the alignment and may even drive the system toward\ncloser alignment (Ward & Hahn 2003). In contrast, migration via planet-planet\nscattering would magnify any initial misalignments (Chatterjee, Ford & Rasio\n2007), and migration via Kozai cycles accompanied by tidal circularization results in a broad distribution of final inclination angles (Fabrycky & Tremaine\n2007). Thus, measuring the alignment between the orbital axis and the stellar\nspin axis is a means for testing migration theories and for identifying planets\nthat migrated in interesting ways.\nTransit observations can be used to assess the spin-orbit alignment, courtesy\nof a spectroscopic effect observed long ago by Rossiter (1924) and McLaughlin\n(1924) in eclipsing binaries. During a transit, the planet hides part of the rotating stellar disk, causing an \"anomalous\" Doppler shift. When the planet transits\nthe approaching (blueshifted) half of the star, the net starlight appears slightly\nredshifted, and vice versa, as shown in Fig. 3. For the configuration shown, in\nwhich the transit impact parameter is approximately 0.5, the signal for a wellaligned planet is antisymmetric about the midtransit time, whereas a strongly\nmisaligned planet that spends all its time covering the receding half of the star\nwould produce only an anomalous blueshift. The key parameter is \u03bb, the angle\nbetween the sky projections of the orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis.\n\n\fe\nRec\nding\nlimb\n\nAppro\nachin\ng lim\n\nb\n\n6\n\nFigure 3.\nThe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Shown are three planet\ntrajectories that produce identical light curves, but have different orientations relative to the stellar spin axis and hence produce different RossiterMcLaughlin signals. In the bottom panels, the dotted lines show a model of\nthe effect in the absence of limb darkening; the solid lines show a model that\nincludes limb darkening. Adapted from Gaudi & Winn (2007).\n\nMeasurements of the projected spin-orbit angle \u03bb have been published for 5\nsystems (Queloz et al. 2000, Winn et al. 2005, 2006, 2007; Wolf et al. 2007; Narita\net al. 2007). In all cases \u03bb is consistent with zero at the 1-2\u03c3 level, with accuracies\nranging from 1\u201330 degrees. This has led to the working hypothesis that the\nmigration of hot Jupiters generally preserves spin-orbit alignment. Importantly,\nstar-planet tidal interactions (which are responsible for spin synchronization and\norbital circularization of the planet) do not confound the interpretation because\nthe expected timescale for tidal reorientation is generally 1010 yr or longer, as\nestimated using the equilibrium-tide theory of Hut (1981).\nObservations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect provide only a lower limit\non the stellar obliquity, the angle between the orbital and rotation axes. The\nRM waveform is sensitive the angle between the sky projections of those axes,\nand the inclinations with respect to the sky must be determined with other\ndata. The orbital inclination is often known to within \u22481 deg from the transit\nlight curve, but the stellar inclination is usually unknown. The single exception thus far is HD 189733. That star is chromospherically active and exhibits\nquasiperiodic flux variations (presumably due to star spots) from which the rotation period can be measured (Henry & Winn 2007). The combination of a\nmeasured rotation period, stellar radius, and projected rotation rate (which can\nbe measured from either the amplitude of the RM effect or from the observed\nspectral-line broadening) places a constraint on the stellar inclination, which is\nconsistent with being edge-on.\nMore work remains to be done on confronting the specific predictions of\nplanet-planet scattering and Kozai cycles with the data. The case of HD 147506\n(also known as HAT-P-2) is especially interesting because the planet has a highly\neccentric orbit (e = 0.5), naturally raising the possibility of planet-planet scat-\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 4.\nPhotometric and spectroscopic observations of transits of\nHD 189733 (left) and HD 147506 (right; also known as HAT-P-2). The radial\nvelocity data during the transit exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The\nprojected spin-orbit angle \u03bb was found to be small in both cases, through a\nsimultaneous fit to the photometry and radial-velocity data. The precision\nis much lower for HD 147506 because the transit is nearly equatorial, which\ncauses a strong degeneracy between v sin i and \u03bb (see Gaudi & Winn 2007).\n\ntering or Kozai cycles, yet the system is well-aligned (Winn et al. 2007). In\nthis case, however, the achievable accuracy in \u03bb was limited to about 14 degrees\nbecause the transit is nearly equatorial. In such cases the Rossiter waveform\nis always antisymmetric and the value of \u03bb is encoded in the amplitude of the\nsignal, which causes a strong degeneracy with the value of the stellar projected\nrotation velocity (see Gaudi & Winn 2007).\nAcknowledgments.
