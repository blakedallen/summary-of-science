The characterization of ultrashort pulses is an\nimportant problem in this field. The attosecond metrology is based on the laser assisted XUV (extreme ultraviolet) photoemission, whereby the temporal structure of\nthe XUV pulse is reflected in the resulting streaked photoelectron spectrum [1, 2]. A subfemtosecond XUV pulse\ncreates a photoelectron wave packet temporally confined\nwithin a fraction of the oscillation period TL of the laser\nlight. The wave packet is accelerated or decelerated by\nthe superimposed laser field, and the dependence of the\nkinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the release time\nallows to record the time dependent spectra with a resolution around 100 as [3].\nThe gross features of the process can be understood\nwithin a quasi-classical model, in which the evolution\nof the photoelectron wave packet is split into two steps:\nfirst, a short XUV pulse creates an initial momentum\ndistribution, which is then treated as a distribution of\nclassical particles accelerated by the laser electric field.\nThe model explains modulations of the width and center of gravity of the photoelectron spectra depending on\nthe time delay of the laser pulse relative to the XUV\npulse [1, 2]. Quantum-mechanical calculations of laser\nassisted atomic photoionization performed in Refs. [6, 7]\nhave confirmed that the XUV pulse duration can be\nmeasured by the width modulation. Recently, various quantum-mechanical formalisms have been proposed\nthat reveal the connection between temporal characteristics of the pump pulse and the streaked spectrum and\nform a basis for characterizing both the pulse and the\nelectronic system being excited [8, 9]. Because the pump\nperturbation cannot be completely disentangled from the\nprobe laser field the inverse problem \u2013 the reconstruction\nof the input pulse from the output spectra \u2013 is a difficult\n\none.\nIn Ref. [3] an XUV pulse of duration 250 as was first\nmeasured by the streaked photoelectron spectra from\nneon atoms, and it has been shown that the streaked\nspectrum can be treated as a tomographic image of\nthe initial time-momentum distribution of photoelectrons.\nThe two-step model has become a common paradigm\nin laser assisted photoemission [10, 11, 12]. Although\nthe initial time-momentum distribution rini (p, t) appears\nto be an important concept in the theory of photoelectron streaking it is not straightforward to rigorously define this notion. A quantum-mechanical derivation of\nrini performed in Ref. [13] showed that under certain assumptions a function independent of the streaking field\ncan indeed be constructed, and it reduces to the timemomentum distribution r0 (p, t) in the absence of the\nlaser field. In Ref. [14] an alternative prescription for\nrini was introduced, which very satisfactorily described\nthe streaked photoemission lineshape for a wide range of\nthe XUV pulse durations and delay times. Understanding of the physical meaning and usage of the function\nrini (p, t) is important in order to correctly interpret the\nstreaked spectra and obtain information about ultrafast\nelectronic processes.\nIn the present paper the classical approach based on\nrini (p, t), which hitherto has been used mainly for illustrative purposes, will be shown to have predictive power. We\nshall develop the semiclassical superposition approximation (SSA), in which the pump and the probe pulses can\nbe disentangled. For a bandwidth-limited pump pulse it\nreduces the calculation of the final momentum intensity\ndistribution of photoelectrons J(p) to the integral [14]\nZ +\u221e\nJ(p) =\nU (t)I[p \u2212 \u2206p(t)]S[p \u2212 \u2206p(t)] dt,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the shape of the pump pulse enters through its\ntime intensity envelope U (t) and spectral intensity envelope I(p), and the properties of the system enter through\nthe excitation cross-section S(p). The effect of the laser\n\n\f2\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe shall consider a one-dimensional prototype of the\nphotoexcitation of an atom or a localized state at a solid\nstate surface and apply the SSA to link the input to the\noutput using the initial time-momentum distribution as\nan intermediary. The paper is organized as follows. The\ncomputational method is described in Sec. II. In Sec. III\nwe analyze the time-momentum distribution of photoelectrons from a chirped pulse in the absence of the laser\nfield. Section IV discusses laser dressed photoemission\nby non-chirped pulses: it reveals problems in defining the\ninitial time-momentum distribution function rini and introduces a practical ansatz for rini . Section V generalizes\nSSA to chirped pulses and discusses the inverse problem.\nII.\n\nMODEL PARAMETERS AND METHOD\n\nIn order to avoid any numerical approximations in solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation we employ\nthe one-dimensional model adopted in Ref. [14]. The unperturbed Hamiltonian (in the units h\u0304 = 1, m = 1/2) is\n\u0124 = \u2212\u2206 + V (z). The model potential V (z) is a piecewise constant function shown in Fig. 1(a). The system\nis enclosed in a box, so that the spectrum of \u0124 is discrete. This setup describes the photoemission from a\nlocalized atomic state in a crystal close to the surface.\nWe shall consider the lowest state of the model atom\n[\u01ebi = \u221218.1 eV, see Fig. 1(b) and the figure caption]. The\nXUV pulse creates two wave packets traveling in opposite directions. We shall consider the spectrum of the\none traveling to the right. Although the presence of the\nsurface barrier between bulk and vacuum, see Fig. 1(a),\nis not essential for the present application, the barrier is\nretained for technical convenience: it reduces the total\nnumber of energy levels and slows down the right traveling packet.\nThe electric field E(t) applied to the system is a superposition of the XUV (subscript X) and laser (L) pulses:\nE(t) = Ex (t\u2212tx ) cos[\u03c9x (t\u2212tx )]+El (t\u2212tl ) sin[\u03c9l (t\u2212tl )].\nThe XUV and the laser pulse are confined to the intervals\nof length Dx and Dl centered at tx and tl , respectively,\nand their envelopes Ex and El have the same shape\n\u0015\n\u0014\nDx,l Dx,l\n0\n2 \u03c0t\nEx,l (t) = Ex,l cos\n,\nfor t \u2208 \u2212\n,\nDx,l\n2\n2\nsee Fig. 1(c). Note that Dx,l are twice the FWHM duration often used in the literature.

The choice\nof the integrand will be explained in Sec. IV A, and in\nSec. V it will be extended to chirped pulses by replacing\nthe function I(p) in the integrand by a function g(p, t)\nwith an explicit time dependence:\nZ +\u221e\nJ(p) =\nU (t)g[p \u2212 \u2206p(t), t]S[p \u2212 \u2206p(t)] dt.\n\n-18.1\n\natom\n-400\n\n0\n\n400\n\nDOS\n\ntX\n\nz (a.u.)\n\ntL\n\nDL\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Potential V (z) of the model 1D system.

(c) Superposition of the electric field of the XUV\npulse of duration Dx and the laser pulse of duration Dl .\n\nI(\u03c9) of such XUV pulse is close to Gaussian. To construct the classical model we shall need the normalized\ntemporal intensity envelope of the XUV pulse U (t) defined by the formula\n\u00032\n\u0002\nU (t) = Ex (t)/Ex0 .\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9x (t) = \u03c9x0 + b(t \u2212 tx ).\n\n(2)\n\nAll calculations are performed for \u03c9x = 91 eV and\nEx0 = 106 V/cm, which is within the perturbational limit.\nWe shall also consider linearly chirped pulses, with \u03c9x\nchanging in time:\n\nThe parameters of the laser pulse applied to the system\nare typical of attosecond spectroscopy [15]: all calculations are performed for frequency \u03c9l = 1.65 eV (Tl =\n2.5 fs) and duration Dl = 5 fs. In the following we set the\ncenter of the laser pulse to zero, tl = 0. If not otherwise\nstated the laser field amplitude is El0 = 6 \u00d7 107 V/cm.\nThe perturbation in dipole approximation is zeE(t),\nand the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE) is\nsolved in matrix form in terms of exact eigenfunctions of\n\u0124. In spite of its simplicity the model is quite realistic. In\nparticular, the energy variations of the excitation crosssection are in accord with those experimentally observed,\nsee Ref. [14]. A more sophisticated development of the\nmodel has been recently applied to laser assisted photoemission from solids [16]. The wave packets created by\nthe XUV pulse can be driven back to the ion and rescatter, thereby absorbing additional UV photons. This was\nstudied for ionization in Ref. [17] and for electron scattering on an ion in Ref. [18] by solving the TDSE for a\n1D and 2D model system. In the present work we are interested in the energy distribution J(\u01eb) of photoelectrons\nrecorded by a detector far away from the excitation region. The spectrum J(\u01eb) is calculated by reexpanding the\npacket moving to the right in terms of the eigenfunctions\nof the system.\nWe shall adopt the following convention about notation. The three variables \u2013 energy \u01eb, momentum p, and\nfrequency (XUV photon energy) \u03c9 \u2013 can be used one\ninstead of another as argument of frequently used functions. They are simply connected: \u03c9 = \u01eb \u2212 \u01ebi , with\n\n\f3\n\u01ebi being the energy of the photoemission initial state;\n\u01eb = p2 + V0 . The kinetic energy of the photoelectron in\nvacuum is, thus, \u01ebi + \u03c9 \u2212 V0 . For the sake of brevity,\nwe shall use \u01eb, p or \u03c9 depending on the context, e.g.,\nJ(\u03c9) is the short for J(\u03c9 + \u01ebi ), and J(p) is the short for\nJ(p2 + V0 ).\nIII.\n\nXUV EMISSION WITHOUT LASER FIELD\n\nThe temporal evolution of the photoelectron spectrum\nduring the XUV pulse is shown in Fig. 2 for a bandwidth\nlimited and for linearly chirped pulses. The color map\nshows the time and energy dependent occupation number\nJ(\u01eb, t) of eigenstates | \u01eb i. The vertical cross section of\nthe map at the end of the pulse J(\u01eb, tx + 21 Dx ) \u2261 J(\u01eb)\nis the energy distribution curve (EDC) measured in the\nexperiment. The time derivative of the function J(\u01eb, t)\ngives the energy resolved transition rate\nr0 (\u01eb, t) = dJ(\u01eb, t)/dt.\n\n(3)\n\nThe function r0 (p, t) is, thus, the time-momentum distribution of photoelectrons in the absence of the laser\nfield.\nIn the absence of the laser field the observed final EDC\nobeys the simple formula [14]:\nJ(\u01eb) \u223c I(\u01eb)S(\u01eb),\n\n(4)\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Time dependent occupation of final\nstates J(\u01eb, t) for the duration Dx = 2000 as, \u03930x = 3 eV (left\ncolumn) and 400 as, \u03930x = 15 eV (right column). The chirp\nrate b is zero in graphs (a) and (d), and b = 6 (b), 12 (c),\n96 (e), and 240 eV/fs (f). The photoelectron energy is given\nrelative to \u01ebi + \u03c9x0 [the frequency at t = 0 is \u03c9x0 = 91 eV, see\nEq. (2)] and time relative to tx . The maximum intensity is\nset to 1. The vertical cross section at the right border of the\nmap is the final intensity distribution J(\u01eb) recorded by the\ndetector.\n\nwhere I(\u03c9) is the spectral intensity distribution of the\nXUV pulse, and S(\u01eb) is the photoemission cross-section,\n\ns\n0a\n\n0\n\n40\n\n0\n\nas\n\nas\n\n0\n\n120\n\nEquation (4) predicts the photoelectron spectrum without solving the TDSE. It is a consequence of the weak\nXUV perturbation and of the negligible probability of\ntransitions within the (quasi-) continuum, \u01eb > 0, see Appendix. (This relation is also obtained in the perturbational limit of the approximation to the TDSE introduced\nby Lewenstein et al. [19], i.e., in the limit when the vector\npotential of the electric field can be neglected compared\nto the electron momentum.) For the present system it is\nfound to hold for XUV pulses over a wide range of pulse\nparameters. Also the entire map J(\u01eb, t) calculated from\nEq. (4) practically coincides with the exact result.\nThe spectrum evolution is seen to strongly depend on\nthe chirp rate. The effect of a linear chirp on the intensity spectrum can be characterized by the dimensionless\nindex \u03b7 = bDx /\u03930x , where \u03930x is the full spectral width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of the non-chirped pulse with\nthe same envelope and the carrier frequency \u03c9x0 . When\n\u03b7 approaches 4 the J(\u01eb, t) map starts acquiring a characteristic stripe structure, see Fig. 2(b,c,f). However, it is\nnot straightforward to determine the value of the chirp\nrate from a known J(\u01eb, t) distribution.\nTo illustrate the point, we show in Fig. 3 the time\ndependence of the center of gravity of the EDC \u01ebg (t) obtained by integrating along vertical lines in the transition\n\nrate map, see Fig. 2. The function \u01ebg (t) has a complicated form with variable slope, which depends not only\non the photon energy sweep b but also on the pulse duration. The fact that b cannot be immediately inferred\nfrom d\u01ebg (t)/dt is a combined effect of two factors: the\nFWHM of the EDC changes with time, and the broader\nthe EDC the stronger it is affected by the energy dependence of the cross-section S(\u01eb). In the present example the cross-section is higher at lower energies, see right\npanel of Fig. 3, so the broader the frequency distribution\n\n800\n\n(5)\n\nphotoelectron energy (eV)\n\n2\n\nS(\u01eb) = | h \u01eb | z | \u01ebi i | .\n\n-10\n\n-600\n\n-10\n\n-300\n\n0\n\ntime (as)\n\n300\n\n600\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\ncross-section (arb. un.)\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Time dependence of the photoelectron spectrum center of gravity \u01ebg (t) for the chirp rate b =\n\u00b124 eV/fs for three pulse durations: Dx = 400, 800, and\n1200 as.

At t = Dx /2 the curves of\nopposite chip converge, which follows from Eq. (4) because the spectrum I(\u03c9) of a linearly chirped pulse does\nnot depend on the sign of chirp.\nThe function J(\u01eb, t) is the most fundamental quantity\nthat contains information about the details of the ionization process. In the simple case considered above the\nproperties of the system enter via the energy dependent\ncross-section S(\u01eb), and its structure is seen to be reflected\nin J(\u01eb, t). At the same time, this means that in general the XUV pulse cannot be satisfactorily characterized\nby gross features of the resulting photoelectron spectrum\nevolution. In addition, the function J(\u01eb, t) cannot be directly measured in an experiment, which makes the problem of disentangling the pulse characteristics from the\nproperties of the system highly nontrivial. The only way\nto probe J(\u01eb, t) is the laser streaking technique, which we\nconsider in the next section.\n\nIV.\n\nEFFECT OF LASER FIELD ON LINESHAPE\n\nLet us consider photoelectrons emitted parallel to the\nelectric field of a linearly polarized light. They are accelerated or decelerated depending on the sign of the momentum transfer \u2206p(t) = (e/c)A(t) from the laser field to\nan electron created at the time t. As a result, the spectrum shifts as a whole on the kinetic energy scale and\ndistorts. One reason for the distortion is a finite width\nof the photoelectron spectrum: electrons with different\nmomenta p acquire different energies, so the spectrum\nbroadens when accelerated and narrows when decelerated. Another source of distortion is the finite duration\nDx of the XUV pulse: electrons created at different moments t are differently accelerated according to the current value of the momentum transfer \u2206p(t).\n\npicture of the streaking measurement [3]:\n\nJ(p) =\n\nrini [p \u2212 \u2206p(t), t] dt.\n\nThis equation means that the electron created at a moment t in the state p \u2212 \u2206p(t) is brought by the laser field\nto the final state p, and all such processes at different moments t during the action of the XUV pulse are summed\nup incoherently.\nLet us concentrate on the physical meaning of the\nfunction rini (p, t). This function characterizes the XUV\npulse, and at the same time it depends on the properties of the electronic system. To define this function\nrequires a separation of the XUV and the laser pulses,\nwhich is, in general, not possible. For example, the timemomentum distribution in the absence of the laser field\nr0 (p, t) cannot serve this purpose. First, even in the simplest case of a bandwidth limited pulse, for momenta far\nenough from the central momentum the function r0 (p, t)\nbecomes negative because the momentum distribution of\nphotoelectrons narrows with time. This is illustrated by\nthe dot-dashed line in Fig. 4(a), which shows two examples of r0 (p, t) calculated by the TDSE. The implication\nfor the laser assisted photoemission is shown in Fig. 5,\nwhich compares exact streaked spectra from the TDSE\nwith those from the SSA. Although the contribution from\nnegative values of r0 is small it is not negligible, which\nis seen by the negative values of the spectral intensity\nin the dashed curves in Fig. 5. More important is that\nalso around the central momentum, for which r0 is everywhere positive [dashed line in Fig. 4(a)], it provides a\nrather inaccurate final distribution J(p) (compare dotted\nand dashed lines in Fig. 5).\nInstead of r0 we can use in Eq.

Dotted lines are the full solution of the TDSE, and\nsolid lines are obtained from the SSA equation (6) with the\nfunction rini from Eq. (7). Dashed curves result from using\nthe laser-free function r0 in Eq. (6).\n\nintroduced in Ref. [14], which turns out to perform much\nbetter, see solid lines in Fig. 5. In the phenomenological\nformula (7) the explicit time dependence of the initial\ntime-momentum distribution comes solely through the\ntemporal intensity envelope U (t) of the XUV pulse [see\nEq. (1)], which is shown by the solid line in Fig. 4(a).\n(Oscillations with the frequency \u03c9x are, thus, completely\nignored.) In the presence of the laser field the functions\nI and S in Eq. (6) also depend on time through the argument p \u2212 \u2206p(t). The formula (7) establishes a simple\nconnection between the structure of the XUV pulse and\nthe streaked photoelectron spectrum, and it can be useful\nfor the characterization of the pulse provided it reasonably simulates the true spectrum. It satisfies the two\nlimiting cases: first, for an extremely short pulse, \u2206p(t)\ncan be considered constant, and Eqs. (6)\u2013(7) yield a shift\nof the spectrum as a whole. Second, in the absence of the\nlaser field the equation (4) is recovered.\nFigure 4(a) compares laser-free functions r0 (\u01eb, t) with\nthe function U (t) used in the ansatz (7). At the Fermi\ngolden rule energy \u01ebi + \u03c9x the true population profile r0\nis retarded by some 100 as with respect to the XUV intensity profile U (t), which is sufficient to cause an error\nof more than 3 eV in the location of the spectral maximum. At the same time, equation (6) with the heuristic ansatz (7) reproduces the spectra with a surprisingly\nhigh quality (compare dotted and solid lines in Fig. 5).\nThus, in view of the sensitivity of the streaked spectra\nto small details of the function rini (\u01eb, t), the prescription\n(7) appears to be a reasonable choice. The model performs well for durations well exceeding a linear interval\nof the \u2206p(t) function. It describes the dependence of the\nspectral width on release point and pulse duration, as\nwell as the asymmetric shape of the streaked EDCs [see\nFig. 5(d)].\n\nEffect of a rapid change of momentum transfer\n\nA detailed discussion of the laser field induced lineshape variations of photoemission spectra has been presented in Ref. [14]. We shall now consider the possibility\nof inferring the XUV pulse duration from the measured\nstreaked EDC. At a point where \u2206p(t) rapidly changes\nwith time, electrons created at different moments t are\ndifferently accelerated according to the current value of\n\u2206p(t), so the longer the pulse is, the stronger the EDC\nbroadens. This \"temporal\" broadening is accompanied\nby the energy stretch of the spectrum due to a uniform\nshift along the p axis (electrons with higher kinetic energies acquire larger energy from the laser field than those\nwith lower energies). If the integral momentum transfer\ncan be neglected [around t \u2212 tl = \u00b1840 as, see Fig. 4(b)]\nthe latter effect is minimal. It has been suggested in\nRef. [3] that in this case the temporal emission profile\nU (t) is uniquely mapped into a spectral distribution of\nphotoelectrons J(\u01eb), and temporal information can be\nretrieved from a single streak record.\nOwing to the finite spectral width of the XUV pulse\nthe streaking broadening \u2206\u0393e (i.e., the difference between the FWHM of the photoelectron spectra in the\npresence and in the absence of the laser field) depends\non the pulse duration Dx in a complicated manner. Figures 6(a,b) show the dependence of \u2206\u0393e on Dx for two\nrelease points tx and three laser field intensities. Up to\ndurations well exceeding the linear interval of \u2206p(t) the\nstreaking broadening steadily increases with Dx while the\nFWHM of the field-free spectrum steadily decreases. As\na result, two different temporal profiles U (t) may give\nalmost identical streaked spectra.\nThe duration can, however, be immediately inferred\ntX = 840 as\n\n(a)\n\n15\n\n4E0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nDX = 300 as\n0\n\n2E0\n5\n\n(c)\n\n2\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\n(c)\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\n(a)\n\nE0\n\n1\n\nDX = 400 as\n\n0\n\n0\n\ntX = 600 as\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\ntX= 600 as\n\nB.\n\n(b)\n\n4E0\n\n15\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\nDX = 1600 as\n\ntX= -400 as\n\nphotoemission intensity J(\u03c9)\n\nDX = 1000 as\n\n1\n\nDX = 600 as\n0\n2\n\n2E0\n\n10\n\nE0\n1\n\n5\n\nDX = 800 as\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nDX (as)\n\n1500\n\n-840\n\n0\n\n840\n\ntX (as)\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) Graphs (a) and (b) show the dependence of the streaking broadening \u2206\u0393e on the duration Dx of\nthe XUV pump pulse for two release points tx = 840 as (a)\nand 600 as (b) by the full solution of the TDSE (solid lines)\nand by the SSA (dashed lines).

Graph (c) shows the dependence of\n\u2206\u0393e on release time for Dx = 300, 400, 600, and 800 as.\n\n\f6\n\nfor the initial momentum distribution takes into account\nboth the temporal and the spectral structure of the pump\npulse. Thus, from the point of view of photoemission,\nthe pump pulse is thought to produce at the time point\nt transitions with the spectral intensity distribution proportional to g(\u03c9, t) [centered at \u03c9x (t)] and the maximal\nintensity proportional to U (t). In the limit of zero chirp,\naccording to the requirement (8), the function g(\u03c9, t) becomes time independent and reduces to I(\u03c9), which leads\nback to Eq. (7). Note that in contrast to the pulselet\nrepresentation of Ref. [8], the function g(\u03c9, t) does not\ncontain phase, and its width is much smaller than the\nspectral width of a pulselet.\nLet us see how well the SSA (6) with the initial distribution (10) describes the dependence of the streaking\nbroadening \u2206\u0393e on the chirp rate b of the pump pulse.\nFor b = 0 the broadening \u2206\u0393e as a function of tx is practically symmetric with respect to tx = 0, see Fig. 6(c).\nFor long pulses the \"temporal\" broadening mechanism\ndominates, and the curve \u2206\u0393e (tx ) has two distinct maxima (which merge into a broad one at tx = 0 when the\nduration decreases). The symmetric shape is completely\nb = 10 eV/fs\n\nb = 25 eV/fs\n\nb = 50 eV/fs\n\n-840 0 840\n\n-840 0 840\n\n-840 0 840\n\ntX (as)\n\ntX (as)\n\ntX (as)\n\nb = 100 eV/fs\nDX= 400 as\n\n4\n2\n0\n\nDX= 600 as\n\n-2\n\n6\n4\n\nDX= 800 as\n\nWe now generalize the semiclassical approach to\nchirped pulses. We again rely on Eq. (6) to separate\nthe pump and probe pulses, but Eq. (7) is not applicable\nnow because it cannot discriminate between positive and\nnegative chirp. Indeed, the pump pulse enters through its\nspectrum I(\u03c9) and time envelope U (t), while both functions do not depend on the sign of the chirp rate b [defined\nin Eq. (2)]. In order to include the photon energy sweep\nin our model we must ascribe physical meaning to the\nformal notion of instantaneous frequency \u03c9x (t). Thereby\nthe spectral intensity distribution I(\u03c9) in Eq. (7) will acquire an explicit time dependence. To achieve this we\nintroduce an 'instantaneous' spectral intensity distribution g(\u03c9, t). In order to satisfy the basic equation (4) in\nthe absence of the laser field, this function should obey\nthe relation\n+\u221e\nZ\nI(\u03c9) =\ng(\u03c9, t)U (t) dt.\n(8)\n\n(10)\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\nDX= 1000 as\n\nEXTENSION OF SSA TO CHIRPED PULSES\n\nrini (p, t) = U (t)g(p, t)S(p)\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\nV.\n\nrequirement that the convolution (8) yield the FWHM\n\u0393x of the actual spectral distribution I(\u03c9).\nThe semiclassical superposition (6) with the ansatz\n\n\u2206\u0393e (eV)\n\nfrom \u2206\u0393e , and the SSA gives a reasonable approximation\nover a wide range of laser intensities. For small Dx the\nwidth of the non-streaked spectrum increases, and the\nabsolute values of \u2206p(t) start playing a more important\nrole: the energy stretch (which varies in time) interferes\nwith the temporal broadening. At the release point tx =\n600 as the integral momentum transfer is much larger, so\nthe energy stretch at small Dx leads to the presence of a\nminimum in the \u2206\u0393e (Dx ) curve.\nAt short durations, the streaking broadening not only\nbecomes small at the point of zero momentum transfer,\nbut also the sensitivity of \u2206\u0393e to the release point increases, as illustrated by Fig. 6(c). This means that this\npoint is less favorable for the measurement of Dx than the\nmeasurement at the point of maximal momentum transfer. Figure 6(c) suggests that \u2206\u0393e measured at tx = 0\n(maximum \u2206p) and tx = \u00b11250 as (minimum), as well\nas the tx location of the extrema would characterize the\nXUV pulse more accurately.\nFigure 6 shows that the results by the SSA (6)\u2013(7)\nclosely follow the exact solutions (except for the overestimated maximal broadening for longer pulses), and their\nquality does not deteriorate with increasing the streaking\nfield strength.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor a linear chirp and a temporal intensity distribution\nof Gaussian form, U (t) \u223c exp[\u2212(16 ln 2) t2 /Dx2 ], the spectral intensity distribution I(\u03c9) is again a Gaussian with\n1\nFWHM \u0393x = [64(ln 2)2 + Dx4 b2 ] 2 /Dx , and equation (8)\nhas the explicit solution:\ng(\u03c9, t) = exp \u2212\n\n\u03c9x0\n\n2\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212\n\u2212 bt)\n,\n\u03b3 2 /4 ln 2\n\n\u03b3 2 = \u03932x \u2212\n\nDx2 b2\n4\n\n.

One\nof the maxima is strongly damped and the other one is\nenhanced, so the shape of the curve provides a signature\nof the temporal structure of the XUV pulse.\nAt a zero momentum transfer point the photoelectron spectrum excited by a positively chirped pulse is\nstretched by the positive and compressed by the negative laser field. This means that from the measured \u2206\u0393e\nat the two tx points one can infer both the duration and\nthe chirp of the pump pulse [3]. Indeed, Fig. 7 shows\nthat both the broadening and the compression steadily\nincrease with the pulse duration. However, the dependence on chirp rate is more complicated: for a fixed Dx\nthe amplitude of \u2206\u0393e variations first increases with the\nchirp rate, and at larger b it starts decreasing. This nonmonotonic behavior is caused by the interference of the\nenergy stretch mechanism discussed in Sec. IV B: over\nthe whole XUV pulse duration electrons with a wide\nspread of energies are created, which are differently affected by the laser field depending on their energies. At\nhigher chirp rates the spectral width \u0393x of the pump\npulse increases, which blurs the signature of its temporal\nstructure. In addition, with increasing \u0393x the energy dependence of the cross-section [factor S(p) in Eq. (10)] becomes more and more important, whereby the laser-free\nphotoelectron spectral width \u03930e increasingly strongly deviates from \u0393x (see also a discussion in Ref. [14] and the\ncomment on Fig. 3 in the end of Sec. III).\nThe SSA is found to well reproduce the spectral width\nvariations for \u03b7 = bDx /\u03930x < 1.5, which covers a wide\nrange of experimentally interesting pulses. For longer\npulses or larger chirp rates it gives only a qualitative\npicture, see Fig. 7. The model systematically underestimates the amplitude of the \u2206\u0393e oscillations, with\nthe largest discrepancy occurring when the energy sweep\ncauses a compression of the spectrum. This has to be\nexpected as the quantum interference between different\nprocesses that bring the excited electron to a given final\nstate becomes most important in this case. The broadening of the spectra is reproduced much better; in particular, the time point at which the spectral width is\nmaximal is predicted rather accurately. The numerical\nexperiments, thus, suggest that the limitations of the\nSSA lie in treating the interaction with the laser field,\ni.e., in Eq. (6), whereas the heuristic description of the\nenergy sweep by the instantaneous intensity distribution\nin Eq. (10) is quite reasonable.\nIn view of the complicated interplay between different broadening mechanisms and because the pulse width\n\u0393x is a non-linear function of both Dx and b the question\narises whether a chirped pulse can be characterized by extracting only the gross parameter \u2206\u0393e from the streaking\nmeasurements. A more general but complicated procedure is to measure a complete spectrogram J(\u01eb, tx ) and\ndecipher it with a FROG algorithm (frequency-resolved\noptical gating), which under certain conditions allows to\nreconstruct both the intensity profile and the phase of the\npulse [20].

The data are obtained with the exact TDSE.\nAccording to our calculations, neither the b = const lines\nnor the Dx = const ones intersect, which means that,\nin principle, both b and Dx can be determined from a\nlaser-free EDC and a single streaked measurement (for\none of the \u2206p = 0 points). The sensitivity of output to\ninput strongly varies over the map: the uncertainty of Dx\nincreases with Dx , especially for small chirp rates, and\nat short durations the uncertainty of b increases. The\ncomplicated structure of the map implies that solution\nof the inverse problem requires a careful consideration\nof the photoexcitation process, as well as very accurate\nmeasurement of the EDCs.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe main result of this work is the extension of the\nwell known factorization J(\u01eb) \u223c I(\u01eb)S(\u01eb) of the photoelectron spectrum by a single short pulse to laser assisted\nphotoemission [as expressed by Eqs. (6), (7), and (10)].\nThis simple relation tells us that the laser free photoelectron spectrum is determined by the spectrum of the\n\n\f8\nexciting pulse but does not depend upon its temporal\nstructure. In the streaking measurements it is just the\ntemporal structure which is probed, and we have shown\nthat the resulting spectrum depends on the intensity envelope, while the phase structure of the pump pulse is\nblurred. In the case of a Fourier limited pulse it enters only indirectly, as the relation between the temporal\nand the spectral extent of the pulse. In the case of a\nchirped pulse it is insufficient to know the time envelope\nand the spectrum. We have shown that this more complicated temporal structure can to a good approximation\nbe treated in spirit of the formal instantaneous frequency\nby introducing an instantaneous spectral distribution and\nagain neglecting the actual phase relations.\nWe have applied these considerations to calculating\nstreaked spectra within the semiclassical superposition\napproximation. Although the concept of initial timemomentum distribution rini (p, t) lacks a rigorous physical\nmeaning a function with the required properties can be\nconstructed, which is capable of describing the lineshapes\nof streaked spectra for chirped pump pulses. In addition\nto the temporal structure of the pulse it takes into account its spectral extent, i.e., the fact that during the\naction of the pulse electrons are created in all states but\nwith different rate. Both the temporal and the spectral\nfactors are important for the shape of the streaked EDC,\nand the photon energy sweep, which both complicates the\ntemporal structure and broadens the spectrum, provides\na severe test of the SSA model. The model yields quantitatively correct results for a wide range of parameters\nand provides a useful basis for the understanding of the\nrole of pulse parameters and properties of the electronic\nsystem. The latter are included through the energy dependent photoemission cross-section, which was found to\nstrongly affect the lineshapes. The property of the model\nto decouple the semiclassical calculation of the time evolution of the system from the quantum-mechanical calculation of the dipole matrix elements makes it attractive for use for more complicated many-body systems,\nfor which a consistent quantum-mechanical calculation\nis currently computationally infeasible: one can reason-\n\nably suppose that the present formalism would remain\nvalid with a more advanced description of the excitation,\nsee, e.g. Ref. [21] and references therein.\nThe main limitations of the model naturally come from\nits neglect of the quantum interference that accompanies\nthe acceleration of the wave packet by the laser field. In\nthe case considered this led to underestimated broadening and compression for sufficiently large pulse durations\nand chirp rates, but did not affect the qualitative picture.\nThe phenomenological function rini suggested in this\npaper differs from the time-momentum distribution r0 in\nthe absence of the laser field in the two essential features:\nit discards the retardation of the final state population\nwith respect to the pulse intensity profile and avoids negative values of the population rate. Thereby the function\nrini provides the most direct connection between the input pulse and the output EDC, and, moreover, the two\naspects are found instrumental in reproducing the shape\nof the streaked EDCs within the SSA. This means, however, that in solving the inverse problem, i.e., obtaining\ninformation about the pump process from streaking measurements some essential features of the process may be\nlost.\nWe have shown that in the simplest case of a linear\nchirp the relation between the input pulse and output\nspectrum can be presented on a map that establishes\na one to one correspondence between gross features of\nthe input and the output. This means that provided\na reliable theory of photoemission is available and the\nexperimental resolution is high the pump pulse can be\ncharacterized by a few streak records.\n\n[1] M.

(A.3) only the matrix elements djj = h j | x\u0302 | j i and dj0 = h j | x\u0302 | 0 i. Note\nthat this approximation does not depend on the strength\nof the perturbing field E(t). Its validity depends only\non the properties of the system. Then the equations for\ndifferent j separate:\ni\u0227j (t) = a0 (t)E(t)dj0 + aj (t)[\u01ebj + djj E(t)].\n\n(A.4)\n\nLet us write aj (t) as a product aj (t) = exp[\u2212i\u01ebj t]\u03bej (t).\nThen the equation for \u03bej (t) is\ni\u03be\u0307j (t) = exp[i\u03c9j0 t]\u03be0 (t)E(t)dj0 + \u03bej (t)E(t)djj .\n\n(A.5)\n\nHere \u03c9j0 = \u01ebj \u2212 \u01eb0 .

Let us write the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nh\ni\ni\u03c8\u0307(t) = \u01240 + E(t) x\u0302 \u03c8(t)\n(A.1)\nin terms of the discrete spectrum of the eigenstates | j i of\nthe unperturbed operator, \u01240 | j i = \u01ebj | j i. The solution\nconsists in finding the expansion coefficients aj (t):\n\n\u03bej (t) = \u2212i\n\nZt\n\ndt\u2032 \u03be0 (t\u2032 )E(t\u2032 ) dj0 exp[i\u03c9j0 t\u2032 ]\n\n(A.7)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u00d7 exp[idjj (A(t\u2032 ) \u2212 A(t))].\nAt this point we introduce the requirement that the perturbation be small. Its implication is twofold: first, for\nA(t) \u2192 0 the initial state can be considered unaffected by\nthe electric field, so that \u03be0 (t\u2032 ) = 1. Second, the phase\ndjj (A(t\u2032 ) \u2212 A(t)) can be neglected compared to \u03c9j0 t\u2032 .\nThen \u03bej (t) reduces to the Fourier transform E(\u03c9) of the\nXUV pulse multiplied by the dipole matrix element dj0 :\n\n\u03bej (t) = \u2212i dj0\n\nZt\n\ndt\u2032 E(t\u2032 ) exp[i\u03c9j0 t\u2032 ].\n\n(A.8)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n| \u03c8(t) i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\naj (t) | j i.\n\n(A.2)\n\nj=0\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation then reads\nh\niX\nX\ni\n\u0227j (t) | j i = \u01240 + E(t) x\u0302\naj (t) | j i . (A.3)\nLet j = 0 be the initial state, i.e., a0 (0) = 1 and\naj (0) = 0 for j 6= 0. It can be shown that for a sufficiently weak potential V (x) the non-diagonal matrix elements of the position operator x\u0302 are much smaller than\n\nThe photoelectron spectrum after the pulse is over\nJ(\u03c9j0 ) = |\u03bej (Dx /2)|2 is then a product of the photoemission cross-section S(\u03c9j0 ) = |dj0 |2 and the intensity\nspectrum I(\u03c9j0 ) = |E(\u03c9j0 )|2 . (Of course, Eq. (A.8) can\nbe applied to any t, i.e., it describes the evolution of\nthe spectrum, too.) This result is also obtained in the\nperturbational limit of the equations of Ref. [19], but in\nthe present derivation the assumption of plane-wave-like\nfinal states is recast as the approximation of vanishing\nnon-diagonal elements of the perturbation between final\nstates.\n\n\f"}
