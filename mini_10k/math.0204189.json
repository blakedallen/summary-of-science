Presented are\nthe results of simulations and stability investigation of this system.\nKey words: fractional-order regulated system, fractional calculus, model, state space\n1. Introduction\nResearch of the fractional-order derivatives continued in the last decades not\nonly as a mathematical branch [1, 2, 3, 4], etc., but in many applied domains, e.g.\n[5, 6] and in control theory too [7] - [16], etc. In works [7, 8, 9] the first generalizations\nof analysis methods for fractional-order control systems were made (s-plane, frequency\nresponse, etc.). The following of the above-mentioned works were oriented to the\nmethods of fractional-order system parameters identification, methods of fractionalorder controllers synthesis, methods of stability analysis, methods of control of chaotic\nfractional-order systems, and so on.\nIn works [14, 15] was presented a state space model described in vector and matrix\nrelations expressing the fractional-order derivatives\nx(\u03b1) (t) = A x(t) + B u(t),\ny(t) = C x(t),\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThis description is convenient only for simple models of systems with only one\nfractional-order derivation, or for spatial type of systems. In work [16] we proposed a\nstate space model of the linear time-invariant one dimensional system which expresses\n15\n\n\fthe first derivatives in the state space equations and has the classical state space\ninterpretation for the fractional-order system too. On the right side of these equations\nwe can then transfer more than one fractional-order derivatives of the state space variables. A disadvantage of this expression is that in time domain we cannot express the\nstate space equations in vector and matrix relations as in previous description. But\nwe can do this in s-plane.\nThis contribution deals with a mathematical description and analysis of a\nfractional-order regulated system in the state space and the state-space controller\ndesign based on placing the closed-loop poles on the complex plane.\n2. Definition of the system\nFor the definition of the control system we consider a simple unity feedback control\nsystem illustrated in Fig.1, where Gs (s) denotes the transfer function of the controlled\nsystem and Gr (s) is the controller transfer function, both integer- or fractional-order.\nThe differential equation of the above closed regulation system for the transfer funcW(s)\n\nE(s)\n\n+\n\nU(s)\nG r(s)\n\nY(s)\nG s(s)\n\nFigure 1: Unity-feedback control system\ntion of the controlled system Gs (s) = 1/(a2 s\u03b1 + a1 s\u03b2 + a0 ) and the fractional-order\nP D\u03b4 controller Gr (s) = K + Td s\u03b4 has the form\na2 y (\u03b1) (t) + a1 y (\u03b2) (t) + Td y (\u03b4) (t) + (a0 + K) y(t) = K w(t) + Td w(\u03b4) (t)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 are generally real numbers and a0 , a1 , a2 , K, Td are arbitrary constants.\n3. Fractional-order control system with P D\u03b4 controller in the state space\nConsider the system described by differential equation (2). After its modification\nand substitution of state space variables x(t) = x1 (t), \u1e8b(t) = x2 (t), \u1e8d(t) = x \u03072 (t) we\ncan derive the following state space model equivalent to model (2)\nx \u03071 (t) = x2 (t) ,\na0 + K (2\u2212\u03b1)\nTd (1+\u03b4\u2212\u03b1)\na1 (1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b1)\n1 (2\u2212\u03b1)\nx \u03072 (t) = \u2212\n(t) \u2212\n(t) \u2212\n(t) +\nx1\nx2\nx2\nw\n(t) , (3)\na2\na2\na2\na2\n(\u03b4\u22121)\n\ny(t) = K x1 (t) + Td x2\n\n(t) ,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nOf course, we can make other alternative state space models for the same system.\nFor the approximation of the fractional-order derivatives on the right-hand side of\nequations (3) we can take the relation (4) from e.g. [2, 3, 10]\nN (t)\nX\nbj y(t \u2212 jh) ,\n(4)\ny (\u03b1) (t) \u2248 h\u2212\u03b1\nj=0\n\n16\n\n\fnh i h io\nt , L ,\nwhere L is \"memory length\", h is time step of calculation, N (t) = min\nh\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001\n[z] is the integer part of z, bj = (\u22121)j \u03b1j , and \u03b1j is binomial coefficient. To calculate\nbj it is convenient to use the following recurrent relation\nb0 = 1 , bj = (1 \u2212\n\n1+\u03b1\n) bj\u22121\nj\n\n(5)\n\nAfter the above-mentioned fractional-order derivatives discretisation (4) and discretisation of the first derivatives on the left-hand side of equations (3) we obtained the\nsimple Euler methods for solving the state space model\nx1,k+1 = x1,k + h x2,k ,\nk\nk\n\u0010 a +K\nX\nTd \u03b1\u2212\u03b4\u22121 X\n0\nx2,k+1 = x2,k + h \u2212\nbj x1,k\u2212j \u2212\ncj x2,k\u2212j\nh\u03b1\u22122\nh\na2\na2\nj=0\nj=0\n\u2212\n\nk\nk\n\u0011\n1 \u03b1\u22122 X\na1 \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u22121 X\ndj x2,k\u2212j +\nbj wk\u2212j\nh\nh\na2\na2\nj=0\nj=0\n\nyk = K x1,k + Td h(1\u2212\u03b4)\n\nk\nX\n\nej x2,k\u2212j\n\n(6)\n\nk \u2265 0.\n\nj=0\n\nFrom these equations we can compute state trajectories of the fractional-order control\nsystem described above.\n4. Design of the P D\u03b4 controller in the state space\nAfter Laplace transformation we can write state space equations (3) in vector and\nmatrix relations in s-plane\npX(s) = A(s) X(s) + B(s) W (s),\nY (s) = C(s) X(s),\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere matrix A(s) and vectors B(s), C(s) are\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9T\n0\n1\n0\nK\n\uf8fb, B(s) = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb, C(s) = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nA(s) = \uf8f0\n1 2\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b4\u22121\na0 +K 2\u2212\u03b1\na1 s1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 +Td s1+\u03b4\u2212\u03b1\ns\nT\ns\n\u2212 a2 s\n\u2212\nd\na2\na2\nFrom equations (7) we can derive the overall transfer function\nC adj(sI \u2212 A) B\nY (s)\n=\nW (s)\ndet(sI \u2212 A)\n\n(8)\n\nThe characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is determined by solving the\ndeterminant in the denominator of the transfer function, which is a fractional-order\npolynomial in s\na2 s\u03b1 + a1 s\u03b2 + Td s\u03b4 + (a0 + K) = 0\n(9)\n17\n\n\fSolving this equation we can find the poles of the closed-loop system with known\nparameters, or design the P D\u03b4 controller parameters for desired control system poles.\nConsider the system described by differential equation (2) with system coefficients\na2 = 0.8, a1 = 0.5, a0 = 1, \u03b1 = 2.2, \u03b2 = 0.9. The task is to determine the controller\nparameters K, Td and \u03b4 for desired control system poles s1,2 = \u22121\u00b16i and the steady\nstate error less than 4%. Parameter K = 24 can be computed from the equation based\non the steady state error ess (\u221e) of the closed-loop control system K = (100/ess \u22121)a0 .\nIf we introduce the desired system poles s1,2 to the characteristic equation (9) we\nobtain system of two nonlinear equations from which we can easy derive two equations\n\u03b4 = arctan(2, 9839) 1,8098\nand Td 2 37\u03b4 = 645, 2174 for the calculation of the controller\n\u03c0\nparameters Td = 6, 9407 and \u03b4 = 0, 71859. In Fig.2 and Fig.3 are depicted the unit\n- step responses of the classical numerical solution [10] and the numerical solution of\nthe state space model (6). The obtained state trajectory represents stable focal point\nfor the above-mentioned coefficients of the system.\n1.8\n\n0.15\n\n1.6\n0.1\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n0.05\nX2\n\ny(t)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n0\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\ntime [sec]\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u22120.1\n\n6\n\nFigure 2: Unit step response\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\nX1\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\n0.04\n\n0.045\n\n0.05\n\nFigure 3: State trajectory\n\nAssuming the integer-order P D controller we obtain a system of two linear equations for direct calculation of the controller parameters K = 36, 0854 and Td = 4, 0141.\nIf we increased in case of fractional-order P D\u03b4 controller the requirement on steady\nstate error less than 2% we would obtain the following controller parameters K = 49,\nTd = \u221279, 74427 and \u03b4 = \u22120, 55194. That means, we obtained the controller with\nweak integrator. But the characteristic equation of such a system has one additional\npole s3 = 1, 98 and it follows from the stability analysis that such closed-loop system\nis unstable. We can verify this fact also with frequency methods for stability investigation of the fractional-order system [12, 13]. In this case we can change the desired\ncontrol system poles s1,2 , or we have to proceed in a different way, e.g. as follows.\n5. Fractional-order control system with P I \u03bb controller in the state space\nThe differential equation of the closed regulation system for the transfer function\nof the controlled system Gs (s) = 1/(a2 s\u03b1 + a1 s\u03b2 + a0 ) and the fractional-order P I \u03bb\ncontroller Gr (s) = K + Ti s\u2212\u03bb has the form\na2 y (\u03b1+\u03bb) (t) + a1 y (\u03b2+\u03bb) (t) + (a0 + K) y (\u03bb) (t) + Ti y(t) = K w(\u03bb) (t) + Ti w(t)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb are generally real numbers and a0 , a1 , a2 , K, Ti are arbitrary constants.\n18\n\n\fThe state space model equivalent to model (10) has the folloving form\nx \u03071 (t) = \u2212x2 (t) + w,\nx \u03072 (t) = +x3 (t) ,\nTi (3\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03bb)\na0 + K (2\u2212\u03b1)\na1 (1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b1)\nK (2\u2212\u03b1)\nx \u03073 (t) = +\nx1\n(t) \u2212\nx2\n(t) \u2212\nx1\n(t) +\nw\n(t) , (11)\na2\na2\na2\na2 1\ny(t) = x2 (t) ,\nt \u2265 0.\nwhere x \u03071 (t) = \u017c(t) is the actuating error signal and x \u03072 (t) = v \u03071 (t), x \u03073 (t) = v \u03072 (t) are the\nstate variables of the controlled system (Fig.4).

If we introduce the\ndesired system poles s1 , s2 , s3 to the characteristic equation (12) we obtain a system\nof three nonlinear equations from which we can numericaly calculate the controller\nparameters K, Ti and \u03bb.\n6. Conclusion\nWe have presented a mathematical description of a fractional-order control system\nin the state space and the state-space controller design based on placing the closedloop poles on the complex plane. In the design of a fractional-order P D\u03b4 regulator\nit is necessary to pay attention to the question of stability of the control system. In\nthe case of negative values of \u03b4 the order of the system increases. In addition to the\nrequired poles, the system can develop new poles that can render the system unstable.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partially supported by grant VEGA 1/7098/20 from the Slovak\nGrant Agency for Science.\n19\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K.B.Oldham, J.Spanier: The Fractional Calculus.
