This flyby provided a unique opportunity to evaluate and calibrate\nour method of determination of size, 3-D shape, and spin of an asteroid from ground-based observations. Knowledge of certain\nobservable physical properties of small bodies (e.g., size, spin, 3-D shape, and density) have far-reaching implications in furthering\nour understanding of these objects, such as composition, internal structure, and the effects of non-gravitational forces. We review\nthe different observing techniques used to determine the above physical properties of asteroids and present our 3-D shape-modeling\ntechnique KOALA \u2013 Knitted Occultation, Adaptive-optics, and Lightcurve Analysis \u2013 which is based on multi-dataset inversion.\nWe compare the results we obtained with KOALA, prior to the flyby, on asteroid (21) Lutetia with the high-spatial resolution\nimages of the asteroid taken with the OSIRIS camera on-board the ESA Rosetta spacecraft, during its encounter with Lutetia on\n2010 July 10. The spin axis determined with KOALA was found to be accurate to within two degrees, while the KOALA diameter\ndeterminations were within 2% of the Rosetta-derived values. The 3-D shape of the KOALA model is also confirmed by the\nspectacular visual agreement between both 3-D shape models (KOALA pre- and OSIRIS post-flyby). We found a typical deviation\nof only 2 km at local scales between the profiles from KOALA predictions and OSIRIS images, resulting in a volume uncertainty\nprovided by KOALA better than 10%. Radiometric techniques for the interpretation of thermal infrared data also benefit greatly\nfrom the KOALA shape model: the absolute size and geometric albedo can be derived with high accuracy, and thermal properties,\nfor example the thermal inertia, can be determined unambiguously. The corresponding Lutetia analysis leads to a geometric albedo\nof 0.19 \u00b1 0.01 and a thermal inertia below 40 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 , both in excellent agreement with the Rosetta findings. We consider\nthis to be a validation of the KOALA method. Because space exploration will remain limited to only a few objects, KOALA stands\nas a powerful technique to study a much larger set of small bodies using Earth-based observations.\nKeywords:\n\n1.

Wenzel\n1\n\nPreprint submitted to PSS\n\npoint-sources in the sky since the discovery of (1) Ceres in\n1801 by Piazzi, almost two centuries before. Only the advent of space exploration and large Earth-based telescopes (e.g.,\nArecibo and Goldstone radio telescopes, space-based-optical\n\u2013 HST, or ground-based near-IR, equipped with adaptive optics \u2013 Palomar, Lick, CFHT, Keck, ESO VLT, Gemini) allowed\ntheir apparent disks to be spatially resolved, and their irregular shapes to be imaged. The past decade has seen a revolution\nin our understanding of the physical properties (e.g., size, 3-D\nshape, spin axis) of asteroids. This revolution has come about\nthanks to improved observing facilities and, of equal importance, from improved methods of analysis.\nDetermination of the physical properties for a statistically\nrelevant set of asteroids has many implications for our underDecember 30, 2011\n\n\fstanding of these remnants of solar-system formation and, in\nturn, can be expected to improve our understanding of the history and evolution of the Solar System. For instance, the distribution of spin axes of the larger asteroids (diameter larger than\n\u223c100 km) on the celestial sphere is not expected to be isotropic.\nNumerical hydrocode simulations have predicted a slight excess in prograde rotators, due to the gas-pebble interaction in\nthe protoplanetary disk (Johansen and Lacerda 2010). Similarly, the spin state of small asteroids (diameter not larger than\nfew kilometers) is dominated by the non-gravitational YORP\neffect (Hanu\u0161 et al. 2011). Statistical knowledge of spin coordinates, how they are distributed within and among asteroid families of different ages, will provide strong constraints on the effectiveness of YORP (Slivan et al. 2003).\nReconstruction of the 3-D shape (including the size) is required to estimate the volume of an asteroid, which in turn is\nused to derive its density, possibly the property most fundamental to our understanding of an asteroid (Britt et al. 2002).\nObservations of the surface of an asteroid, such as colors, spectra, or phase effects, can provide clues to the surface composition of the asteroid. This may or may not be related to the\nbulk composition of the body (e.g., Elkins-Tanton et al. 2011).\nMasses for asteroids can be determined from a spacecraft flyby,\nfrom the orbital motion of a natural moon, or even from the\nperturbations of asteroids on other bodies, such as Mars (Hilton\n2002). In most cases, however, the uncertainty in the density\nis dominated by the uncertainty in the volume, rather than the\nuncertainty in the mass (Merline et al. 2002). Precise reconstruction of the 3-D shape is therefore of high importance for\nall asteroids for which a mass has been, or will be, estimated\n(e.g., Hilton 2002; Mouret et al. 2007; Baer et al. 2011).\nFrom the comparison of an asteroid's density with the densities of its most-likely constituents, we can constrain the macroporosity (large-scale voids) in its interior, probably produced\nby impacts over its history (Britt et al. 2002). These impacts\ncould have partially disrupted the body, producing large-scale\nfractures, or even totally disrupted the body, with subsequent\nreaccumulation of the resulting fragments, leading to a \"rubblepile\" structure.\nEvidence of gigantic, but less than totally disruptive, impacts can be seen by high-resolution imaging and also inferred from our shape-modeling of asteroids. The huge impact\ncraters evident in the images of C-type asteroid (253) Mathilde\n(Veverka et al. 1997) are thought to be about as large as could\nbe sustainable by a body without disruption. There have been\nsuggestions that these craters were created by compaction of\nlow-density target material, rather than explosive ejection typical of hard-rock impacts (Housen et al. 1999). Already, our\nground-based adaptive-optics imaging has shown what appear\nto be facets or depression-like features, similar to those seen\non Mathilde, in some other large C-type asteroids (e.g., (511)\nDavida in Conrad et al. 2007). Alternatively, some of our other\nimages of C-type asteroids, such as (52) Europa, appear to bear\nno evidence of giant impacts (see Merline et al. 2011). Evaluation of the prevalence of such large impact events can give us\ninsight into the size and frequency of these impact events over\ntime, and thus into the history of the impacting population.\n\nWe summarize below the most common of the many observing techniques used to derive size, 3-D shape, and spin-vector\ncoordinates and highlight some of their advantages and drawbacks. Then, in Section 2, we describe our KOALA multi-data\nshape-modeling algorithm. In Section 3, we present a comparison of the results produced by KOALA (from Earth-based\nobservations) with those derived from the ESA Rosetta flyby of\nasteroid (21) Lutetia. In Section 4, we use our KOALA model\nin conjunction with mid-infrared data and a thermophysical\nmodel to derive the thermal properties of Lutetia and compare\nthe results with those derived using thermal observations from\nthe Rosetta spacecraft (Gulkis et al. 2011) and from the ground,\nmaking use of the shape model from the flyby (O'Rourke et al.\n2011). We assess the accuracy of the KOALA shape-modeling\nmethod in Section 5.\n1.1. Optical lightcurve\nHistorically, spin properties and triaxial-ellipsoid shapes\nhave been studied largely through observations of rotationally\ninduced variability in disk-integrated brightness (lightcurves).\nIndeed, the object's shape, its rotational state (period and spinvector coordinates), and the scattering properties of its surface\ncan be determined from the analysis of its lightcurves over time\n(as the viewing/illumination geometry changes).\nFor about a decade, starting with the lightcurve inversion\nalgorithm presented by Kaasalainen and Torppa (2001) and\nKaasalainen et al. (2001), lightcurves also have been used extensively to derive 3-D shape models of asteroids (see the examples for asteroids Gaspra and \u0160teins in Fig. 1). The 3-D\nshape models and spin properties of more than 200 asteroids\nalready have been derived (these are accessible from DAMIT 2 ,\nsee \u010eurech et al. 2010). These shape models are, however, limited to dimensionless, convex shapes, with limited spatial resolution. Recently, \u010eurech et al. (2011) have shown that the size\nof these models can be set by using other types of input data\n(e.g., stellar occultation profiles, see Sect. 1.2). The intrinsic\nconvex nature of the models precludes accurate determination\nof the volume, and hence density, of the objects, however.\nBecause lightcurve observations require neither large telescope aperture nor specialized instrumentation, they are, and\nwill remain, a major source of information on small bodies.\nThousands of lightcurves, for hundreds of asteroids 3 , have\nbeen accumulated during the last half century. Amateur astronomers contribute significantly to this ever-growing database\nof lightcurves 4 (e.g., Behrend et al. 2006; \u010eurech et al. 2007).\nSparse photometry (i.e., when the typical separation between\nmeasurements is larger than the rotation period, as opposed to\nhistorical lightcurves, which are dense in time) can also be used\n2 DAMIT:\n\nhttp://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/web.php\nthe Asteroid Photometry Catalogue (APC) or the Asteroid Lightcurve\nDatabase (LCDB, Warner et al. 2009) list more than 6000 lightcurves for about\n700 asteroids:\nAPC: http://asteroid.astro.helsinki.fi/apc\nLCDB: http://www.minorplanet.info/lightcurvedatabase.html\n4 e.g., about 2300 lightcurves for more than 1700 asteroids have been acquired by the CdR group: http://obswww.unige.ch/\u223cbehrend/page cou.html\n3 e.g.,\n\n2\n\n\fchords) provide enough constraints to determine the triaxial dimensions (ellipsoid) and spin-vector coordinates of an asteroid\n(Drummond and Cocke 1989; Dunham et al. 1990). The number of chords that result from an event will often be larger with\nbrighter occulted stars. This is because many more observers\ncan be fielded if the required telescope aperture is modest.\nIn practice, however, occultations of bright stars by any given\nasteroid occur rather infrequently. This difficulty in obtaining\nsufficient chords, plus the noise level often encountered (especially the systematic errors coming from imperfect knowledge\nof asteroid and star astrometry, combined with observer timing\nerrors), strongly limit our ability to construct 3-D shape models and derive spin properties from occultations alone. Nevertheless, stellar occultations are an efficient way to provide additional size/shape information, particularly for shape models\nthat otherwise lack a scale, such as those from lightcurves alone\n(see 1.1 and \u010eurech et al. 2011).\nWith the availability of low-cost GPS positioning equipment\nand CCD cameras (the majority of measurements are made by\namateur astronomers), the accuracy of occultation timings has\nimproved greatly over the last decade. From this improved precision, together with the refinement of the orbits of small bodies expected to result from Gaia/PanSTARRS (allowing an extremely precise prediction of the occultation track on Earth, see\nTanga and Delbo 2007), we can expect that stellar occultations\nwill become ever more useful in the determination of certain\nphysical properties of asteroids, especially for objects having\nsmall angular diameters.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of four shape models, derived using ground-based observations, with high-spatial-resolution images obtained in situ by spacecraft\n(left-to-right): (951) Gaspra lightcurve inversion model from Kaasalainen et al.\n(2002a), image from NASA Galileo; (2867) \u0160teins lightcurve inversion model\nfrom Lamy et al.

(2010b) and Drummond et al.\n(2010), image from ESA Rosetta.\n\nto reconstruct 3-D models (see Kaasalainen 2004). Hanu\u0161 et al.\n(2011) have used a combination of sparse photometry, together\nwith dense lightcurves, to derive about 100 new shape models,\nusing measurements extracted from large all-sky surveys (such\nas USNO, Catalina, Siding Spring, and Hipparcos). Knowledge\nof the absolute photometry (as opposed to relative photometric\nmeasurements, as in a dense lightcurve) is, however, required to\nmake these sparse measurements useful to 3-D shape modeling\n(see Hanu\u0161 et al. 2011, for a detailed discussion). From the\nupcoming PanSTARRS and Gaia surveys we can expect hundreds of thousands of objects to be modeled using this method\n(\u010eurech et al. 2005).\n\n1.3. Thermal radiometry\nThe amount of thermal emission from an asteroid is mainly\na function of its physical diameter and surface albedo, and, to a\nlesser extent, the physical properties of its surface (e.g., thermal\ninertia, roughness). Main-belt asteroids are among the brightest sources in the sky in the mid-infrared (5\u201320 microns), so infrared satellites (IRAS, ISO, AKARI, Spitzer, Herschel, WISE)\nhave been able to acquire observations of a vast number of these\nobjects (see Mainzer et al. 2011, for instance).\nEstimates for size and albedo are model-dependent, however, and several thermal models co-exist, from the simple\nStandard Thermal Model (STM) of non-rotating spheres of\nLebofsky et al. (1986) to the detailed Thermophysical Model\n(TPM) of Lagerros (1996, 1997), having a complete description of 3-D shape and surface properties. Unfortunately, the\nsystematic uncertainties involved when applying those models\n(resulting from their respective assumptions and approximations) are not always properly taken into account in estimating\nerror bars, and results often differ from one determination to\nanother by more than the quoted uncertainties (see Table 3 in\nDelbo and Tanga 2009, illustrating the issue). For instance, it\nnow seems that the database of 2 228 diameters (Tedesco et al.\n2002) estimated using the overly simple STM with IRAS data\nmay be biased by a few percents (see the re-analysis of IRAS\ndata by Ryan and Woodward 2010).\nThe radiometric technique to derive sizes and albedos from\nthermal infrared data benefits greatly from the availability\nof 3-D shape models. For example, the absolute size of\n\n1.2. Stellar occultation\nOccultations occur when a solar-system object passes between a star and Earth, causing the asteroid's shadow to cross\nsome portion of Earth as a track. Because the star is very far\nrelative to the Earth-asteroid separation, the shadow cast by the\nasteroid is effectively parallel. Thus, the width of the shadow\ntrack (perpendicular to the track) gives the maximum width of\nthe asteroid in the cross-track direction. It is usually not possible to get a high density of observers stationed across the track,\nand thus this dimension may not be so well established. But\nalong the track, the size of the asteroid, as an along-track chord\non the asteroid, corresponding to the position of the observer\nwithin the shadow, is given by the length of time of the blinkout event. With many observers, many along-track events can\nbe recorded and the blink-out intervals are converted to chord\nlengths at the asteroid by using the asteroid's known speed (see\nMillis and Dunham 1989, for a review).\nOne advantage of stellar occultations is that very small minor planets can be probed (provided one accounts properly for\ndiffraction effects). Even stellar occultations by small transNeptunian objects (TNOs) of a few kilometers diameter can be\nrecorded (see Roques et al. 2009). Finally, stellar occultations\nprovide a powerful means for studying thin atmospheres and/or\nexospheres (e.g., Sicardy et al. 2003).\nIn theory, three occultation events (each recorded by enough\nobservers to secure a unique apparent-ellipse to be fit on the\n3\n\n\f(25143) Itokawa derived by M\u00fcller et al. (2005), based on a\n3-D shape model implementation in a TPM code, agreed to\nwithin 2% of the final in-situ result from the Hayabusa mission (Fujiwara et al. 2006). In general, mid-infrared observations are highly valuable for scaling dimensionless shape models (similar to the situation with stellar occultations, as mentioned in Sect. 1.2) and mid-infrared data are available for several thousand asteroids. These data even allow determination\nof the most likely spin-axis solutions in cases where lightcurve\ninversion techniques lead to more than one possible shape and\nspin-axis solution (see, e.g., M\u00fcller et al. 2011, for a recent example). In cases where the shape-model already comes with\nsize information (or alternatively, if many thermal observations\nare available for a given target), it is possible to derive the thermal inertia, indicative of the surface characteristics: e.g., bare\nrock, ice, boulders, dust regolith (see, for instance M\u00fcller et al.\n2005; Delbo et al. 2007, among many others).\nIn some particular cases of extensively observed asteroids,\nthe thermal radiometry can also provide hints on the 3-D shape,\nthrough the measure of the apparent projected cross-section of\nthe asteroid on the plane of the sky at each epoch. By comparing the predicted with observed thermal fluxes of Lutetia under many geometries, O'Rourke et al. (2011) have shown that\nadding a hill/plateau, whose size remains within the quoted 3-D\nshape uncertainty, could explain the discrepancies observed for\na certain observing geometry.\n\nup (Walsh et al. 2008) was suggested by the detailed 3-D shape\nof the NEO (66391) 1999 KW4 (Ostro et al. 2006).\n1.5. Disk-resolved imaging\nSince the 1990s, with the advent of the Hubble Space\nTelescope and large ground-based telescopes equipped with\nadaptive optics (AO: Lick, CFHT, Keck, ESO VLT, Gemini),\nwe have access to the angular resolution required to resolve\nthe apparent disk of asteroids (e.g., Saint-P\u00e9 et al. 1993a,b;\nDrummond et al. 1998; Parker et al. 2002, 2006).\nFrom a time-series of disk-resolved images, spin-vector\ncoordinates can be derived (using previous knowledge of the\nrotation period) by analyzing the changes in the apparent shape\nof the asteroid profile (see for instance Thomas et al. 1997b;\nDrummond and Christou 2008), or by following the apparent\npath taken by an albedo patch on the surface during the rotation\n(e.g., Thomas et al. 2005; Carry et al. 2008). Triaxial shapes\n(ellipsoids) can also be derived (see Drummond et al. 2009;\nSchmidt et al. 2009, for instance), and topography (such as the\npresence of facets or craters) studied from profile deviations\nto the ellipsoid (e.g., Thomas et al. 1997a; Conrad et al. 2007).\nWith sufficient spatial resolution, imaging of the asteroid disk\ncan allow construction of albedo maps of the surface, allowing\nthe study of composition heterogeneity or localized space\nweathering effects (e.g., Binzel et al. 1997; Li et al. 2006,\n2010; Carry et al. 2008, 2010a). In the case of asteroids visited\nby spacecraft, high spatial-resolution and precise photometry\ncan be used to derive precise shape and digital terrain models\nby using stereophotoclinometric techniques (see examples in\nGaskell et al. 2008).\nThe size and 3-D shape resulting from disk-resolved images\nare of great value, being obtained in a direct manner (as compared to an indirect determination of the shape from lightcurve\ninversion, for instance). The best angular resolution 5 of current\nEarth-based telescopes is about 0.04\u2032\u2032 . Due to systematics,\nhowever, we have found that our ability to accurately measure\nsizes degrades rapidly below about 0.10\u2032\u2032 , based on simulations\nand observations of the moons of Saturn and other objects\n(Carry 2009; Drummond et al. 2009). The sample of asteroids\nobservable (i.e., having angular sizes that get above about\n0.10\u2032\u2032 ) is therefore limited to about 200 (over a given 10-year\nspan).\n\n1.4. Radar delay-Doppler echoes\nRadar observations consist in transmitting a radio signal toward the target and recording the echo. The distribution of the\necho power in delay time and Doppler frequency is related to\nthe spin state and 3-D shape of the target (see the reviews by\nOstro 1989; Ostro et al. 2002). The time and frequency precision currently achievable (Arecibo, Goldstone) allow the study\nof very small objects, the main limit of radar observations being the distance of the target (echo power scales inversely with\ndistance to the fourth power). This is why most radar studies\nhave concentrated on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), while dedicated observations of Main-Belt Asteroids (MBAs) have been\nmore limited (see Ostro et al. 2002).\nThe difficulty in constructing 3-D shapes from a series of\ndelay-Doppler \"images \" is due to the absence of a direct, oneto-one, link between each region of the surface with a pixel in\ndelay-Doppler space. Indeed, all points situated at the same\nrange from the observer, and moving at the same radial velocity\n(possibly spread over the apparent disk) will contribute to a single delay-Doppler pixel. So delay-Doppler images are manyto-one maps of the shape as highlighted by Ostro et al. (2002):\nthere is no a priori way to determine how many regions will\ncontribute to a single pixel, which strongly contrasts with the\none-to-one mapping (\"WYSIWYG\") achieved in disk-resolved\nimaging.\nRadar echoes remain, however, the best way to determine the\nphysical properties of NEOs (e.g., the very small NEO Itokawa\nin Fig.1). For instance, the possible migration of the regolith at\nthe surface of a fast-rotating asteroid triggered by YORP spin-\n\n1.6. Interferometry\nApart from building larger telescopes, one efficient way to\nimprove the angular resolution is to combine light beams from\nseparated telescopes and to observe the resulting interference\n(fringes). In such a mode, each telescope aperture plays the role\nof a sample aperture within a virtual telescope whose extent is\nthe largest distance between the two telescopes (the spatial resolution \u0398 is still given by the equation in footnote 5, except that\n5 limited by the diffraction, which acts as a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency approximated by \u0398 = \u03bb/D (radian), \u03bb being the wavelength and D the\ndiameter of the telescope aperture.\n\n4\n\n\fD is now the distance between the apertures). For instance,\nwith telescopes separated by about 80 m, the VLTI provides an\norder-of-magnitude improvement in angular resolution over a\nsingle telescope of the VLT (8 m aperture).\nThis improvement in the resolution, however, occurs at the\nprice of a loss in complete spatial information, because the\nvirtual aperture is under-sampled. The very high angularresolution is limited, at a given instant, to a single line on\nthe plane of the sky, which is given by the baseline linking the\ntwo apertures. Along that baseline, the signal is directly related\nto the Fourier transform of the flux distribution on the plane\nof the sky. To expand the coverage in the spatial-frequency\ndomain, and thus to allow the construction of 2-D images of\nthe target, one must increase the number of projected baselines.\nThis is commonly achieved by either adding multiple physical\nbaselines (i.e., adding more telescopes) and/or by making observations throughout the night, as the Earth's rotation causes\na progression of the position angle of the baseline on the sky.\nHowever, because asteroids typically complete their rotation in\nonly a few hours, the method using multiple telescopes is more\neffective at providing higher spatial sampling. Below we describe another promising technique to effectively increase the\nnumber of baselines, by using a Fizeau design.\nFor objects with no a priori information, the overall dimensions and spin properties can be determined under the assumption that the shape is well-described by a triaxial ellispoid\n(Li et al. 2011). For example, the two orthogonal directions\nof the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) on-board HST have been\nused to study binarity and measure the size of several MBAs\n(Tanga et al. 2001; Hestroffer et al. 2002; Tanga et al. 2003).\nThe fringes of interference, however, also contain information on the apparent shape, and can be used in combination\nwith other data to derive 3-D shape models. For instance,\nKaasalainen and Lamberg (2006) used FGS data in combination with optical lightcurves to refine the 3-D shape model of\n(15) Eunomia from Kaasalainen et al. (2002b).\nInterferometry in the mid-infrared has been used recently\nalso, with promising results. In this wavelength regime, the\nsignal is linked to the distribution of temperature (i.e., emitted light) on the surface of the target (as opposed to the reflected light seen at visible wavelengths). Delbo et al. (2006)\nand Delbo et al. (2009) have combined thermal infrared TPM\nmodels (see Sect. 1.3) with interferometry, allowing the size\nof 3-D shape models to be set (similar to stellar occultation and\nthermal-infrared-only, see Sections 1.2 and 1.3 and Matter et al.\n2011).\nThe current limitation of interferometry is set by the sensitivity of available facilities and is driven largely by the integration\ntime, which is usually short. Because the light beams from the\ntwo apertures traverse different paths in the atmosphere, their\nwavefronts encounter different turbulence-dominated perturbations, leading to a shift in their phase. Delay lines are used to\n\"slow down\" one beam with respect to the other, and to match\ntheir phase. The technical difficulties in maintaining coherence\nin this process limits the integration time to few hundredths or\nthousandths of a second. A new generation of instruments (like\nPRIMA at VLT) with fringe-tracking systems will overcome\n\nthis limitation in the near future, allowing fainter sources to be\ntargeted.\nAn interesting compromise between co-axial interferometers and traditional, filled aperture, telescopes can be found in\nFizeau-type instruments such as LINC-NIRVANA, being built\nfor the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT, see Hill et al. 2010), in\nwhich improved coverage of the spatial-frequency plane (commonly called uv-plane, with u and v standing for the two orthogonal unit directions) can be achieved in less telescope time.\nThis design (Fizeau vs. pupil-plane interferometer like the\nVLTI) allows instantaneous filling of the uv-plane up to the frequency set by the 8 m apertures (Fizeau interferometers are true\nimaging devices and produce direct images of the plane of the\nsky), with an additional filling along one dimension up to the\nfrequencies corresponding to the maximal baseline (22.7 m for\nLBT). Two or three epochs, with different position angles of the\nbaseline on the plane of the sky, will be enough to fill the uvplane up to the maximal extent of the telescope (achievable for\ntransiting asteroids, especially with high elevation, when the\nposition angle evolves quickly). For this purpose, therefore,\nthe LBT is equivalent to a 22.7 m telescope with a mask, corresponding to the configuration of component apertures, placed\nin the entrance pupil.\nThe opening of interferometric studies to longer wavelengths\nalso has great potential, with the use of millimeter and submillimeter arrays, where there are fewer technological limitations than in the optical range. Future facilities such as ALMA,\nwith 50 antennas (translating into 1 225 baselines vs. only\n2 baselines for MIDI at the VLTI, see Delbo et al. 2009), will allow dense spatial coverage, together with an angular resolution\nof few milli-arcseconds. Simulations have shown that several\nhundreds of MBAs and TNOs will be observable with ALMA\n(see Busch 2009; Moullet et al. 2011). Interferometry at thermal wavelengths (mid-infrared to millimeter), in combination\nwith other techniques (e.g., lightcurves, see Sect. 1.1), will thus\nallow the derivation of 3-D shape models, together with thermal\nproperties, for many asteroids of small apparent diameter.\n2. The KOALA algorithm\nWith advantages and drawbacks of each observing technique\nin mind, we have developped a multi-data inversion algorithm:\nKnitted Occultation, Adaptive-optics, and Lightcurve Analysis\n(KOALA), that makes simultaneous use of data from three distinct observation types 6 to determine the physical properties\nof asteroids (Carry et al. 2010a; Kaasalainen 2011). KOALA\ntakes advantage of the direct measure of the apparent size and\nshape of asteroids on the plane of the sky provided by the timings of stellar occultations and disk-resolved images, and of the\nindirect constraints on spin and 3-D shape given by lightcurves.\nWe quickly summarize below how the inversion works (see\nKaasalainen 2011, for a comprehensive description of the algorithm).\n6 We categorize dense (i.e., lightcurves) and sparse photometry together to\nform a single data type.\n\n5\n\n\fKOALA is a step-iterative minimization algorithm, solving for the spin parameters (spin-vector coordinates \u03bb, \u03b2,\nand sidereal period P), 3-D shape (given by a set of N\ncoefficients of spherical harmonics, including the overall\nsize), phase function (defined as a three-parameter model,\nsee Kaasalainen and Torppa 2001; Kaasalainen et al. 2001),\nand scattering law (generally taken as a combination of\nthe Lommel-Seeliger and Lambert diffusion laws, following\nKaasalainen and Torppa 2001, although other models such as\nHapke can be used).\nFrom a set of estimated parameters (determined from\nlightcurve-only inversion or analysis of the disk-resolved images, for instance), a trial solution is created, with associated\nsynthetic data sets (i.e., simulated lightcurves, disk-resolved\nimages, and occultation profiles). KOALA then follows a\nLevenberg-Marquardt minimization scheme to determine the\nset of parameters that best fit all the data sets simultaneously,\nby comparing at each step the synthetic data with real measurements. The iteration stops when the residuals between the\nsimulated and measured data sets reach an acceptable level (i.e.,\nthe level of the intrinsic noise of the measurements).\nAs a safeguard, the resolution (i.e., N) is set to the lowest possible value for which a fit to the data can be achieved.\nWe also introduced several regularizations: (a) a non-convexity\n(\"smoothness\") term, that avoids spurious features (unrealistic topography) at small scales, unconstrained by the data; and\n(b) an inertia tensor regularization for principal-axis rotators,\nthat forces the asteroid spin-axis to remain aligned, within a\nfew degrees, with the largest moment of inertia. The relative\nweights of the different data types and also of the regularizations are determined using the maximum compatibility estimate\nof Kaasalainen (2011), instead of being subjective.\n\nKOALA\nOSIRIS\n\nd\n105\n98\n\nDiameters (km)\na\nb\nc\n124\u00b15 101\u00b14 93\u00b113\n121\u00b11 101\u00b11 75\u00b113\n\nSpin axis (\u25e6 )\n\u03bb \u03b2 \u00b1 \u03c3\n52 -6 \u00b1 5\n52.2 -7.8 \u00b1 0.4\n\nTable 1: Comparison of the dimensions and spin-vector coordinates of (21)\nLutetia derived from OSIRIS images during the ESA Rosetta flyby (Sierks et al.\n2011) with those derived by KOALA (Drummond et al. 2010; Carry et al.\n2010b) prior to the flyby. Volume-equivalent diameter (d) and triaxial diameters (a > b > c) are reported in km, and spin-vector coordinates in degree\n(longitude \u03bb, latitude \u03b2 in the ECJ2000 reference frame, with \u03c3 the angular\nradius of the uncertainty circle).\n\nSierks et al. 2011). At the time of the Rosetta flyby, the southern hemisphere was in seasonal shadow, and observations at\noptical/near-infrared wavelengths were not possible south of 40\u25e6 latitude. The detailed 3-D shape model derived from flyby\nimages by stereophotoclinometry (Sierks et al. 2011) therefore\ndoes not cover a large fraction of the asteroid's southern hemisphere (see Fig. 2), the southernmost portion of the shape model\nbeing determined using the KOALA algorithm together with\nthe ground-based data from Carry et al. (2010b). Almost all\nof the AO images that entered into the KOALA solution, even\nthough from multiple epochs, were taken looking at either high\nsoutherly or high northerly sub-Earth latitudes (see Carry et al.\n2010b; Drummond et al. 2010). For both the ground-based\nKOALA and the flyby analyses, therefore, the shortest (c) dimension (Table 1) is not well constrained and represents the\nlargest contribution to the uncertainty in the volume estimates.\nWe first present (Section 3.1) an overall comparison of\nour size and spin estimates (based on ground-based techniques)\nwith those derived from the analysis of the very high spatialresolution images acquired by OSIRIS (Sierks et al. 2011). We\nthen directly compare the predicted shape profiles, based on\nKOALA, with those images (Section 3.2), seeking to calibrate\nour method.\n\n3. KOALA and Rosetta-flyby shape model\nOn 2010 July 10, the ESA Rosetta spacecraft made a close\nflyby of the main-belt asteroid (21) Lutetia. In support of\nthe mission, we had combined optical lightcurves with diskresolved images, from ground-based AO. We produced a full\n3-D shape model of Lutetia, using KOALA, months before the\nencounter (see Drummond et al. 2010; Carry et al. 2010b, and\nFig. 1). This flyby provided a rare opportunity to test and calibrate KOALA with close-up spacecraft imaging.\nThe closest approach (CA) occurred at 3 170 km from the\nasteroid at a relative speed of 15 km/s. The Narrow Angle\nCamera (NAC) of the OSIRIS instrument on-board Rosetta\n(Keller et al. 2007) returned a total of 202 images during the\nflyby, which spanned about 9 h. The NAC image scale ranged\nfrom 5 000 to 60 m/pix, reaching its minimum value at CA.\nThese very high spatial-resolution images have been used to\nproduce detailed 3-D shape models of Lutetia, using stereophotoclinometry (Sierks et al. 2011), and stereophotogrammetry\n(Preusker et al. 2011). We only consider here the model from\nSierks et al. (2011), these two models being similar enough at\nthe medium-to-large scale for our purpose.\nLutetia's spin axis is tilted such that its pole is nearly\nin its orbital plane (obliquity of 96\u25e6 , see Carry et al. 2010b;\n\n3.1. Overall comparison\nIn this section, we present a comparison of the spin-vector\ncoordinates and dimensions derived from the flyby with the preflyby values from KOALA (Table 1). Because southerly latitudes were not visible during the flyby and the c-dimension in\nthe OSIRIS model comes from a combination of OSIRIS imaging and KOALA model information, the OSIRIS c-dimension\nis not wholly independent. But the spin-vector coordinates and\nequatorial dimensions (a, b) from the OSIRIS analysis can be\nused as \"ground-truth\" to calibrate our KOALA method.\nFirst, the spin-vector coordinates agree to within two degrees 7 , well inside the 5\u25e6 uncertainty quoted for KOALA Then,\nequatorial dimensions (a and b) are within 3 km of the flyby estimates, again well within the uncertainties reported for each\ndimension using KOALA. The larger difference between the\nestimates of the short (c) axis results from the expansion of the\n7 the coordinates obtained with KOALA are 1.2\u25e6 and 1.8\u25e6 from the spinvector solutions derived by F. Preusker (\u03bb = 52.6\u25e6 , \u03b2 = -7.1\u25e6 , pers. communication) and by Sierks et al. (2011) respectively, using the OSIRIS images.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 2: Lutetia 3-D shape model from Sierks et al. (2011), displayed in a\nnet layout. Regions imaged by OSIRIS are displayed in gray. The part of the\nshape model that is based on ground-based data only (lightcurves and images:\nLC+AO) is plotted in blue.\n\nFigure 3: Similar plot as Fig. 2, showing the agreement between the pre-flyby\nKOALA (reddish, Carry et al. 2010b) and post-flyby (grayish, Sierks et al.\n2011) shape models of (21) Lutetia. The radii of the KOALA model are larger\nin red regions, and those of the OSIRIS model in gray regions. The amalgam\nof gray and red colors illustrates the spectacular agreement between the results from the Rosetta flyby and our KOALA model obtained before the flyby.\nThe dominance of red hues, however, highlights the relativly lower sensitivity to concavities of the KOALA model with respect to the OSIRIS 3-D shape.\nShown in this comparison is the original KOALA model of Carry et al. (2010b),\nwith a c-dimension of 80 km (overall size 124 \u00d7 101 \u00d7 80 km), rather than the\nmodified KOALA (\"hybrid\") estimate of Drummond et al. (2010), having a cdimension of 93 km and shown in Table 1. This is a more realistic comparison\nfor the figure because much of the southern hemisphere of the OSIRIS model\n(Fig. 2) is based on the data that entered into the original KOALA model.\n\nKOALA c dimension from its original 80 km to 93 km, based\non the analysis by Drummond et al. (2010). Indeed, the bestfit solution for all the AO images (including an additional observation taken with a more equatorial geometry, presented by\nDrummond et al. (2010) and not used by Carry et al. (2010b)\nowing to calibration issues, see Carry et al. for details) pointed\ntoward a larger c dimension (supported by independent considerations on the amplitude of lightcurves by Belskaya et al.\n2010). The volume-equivalent diameter is, therefore, larger\n(105 vs. 98 km) for the KOALA model than for the flybyderived model by Sierks et al. (2011). Disk-resolved images\nof Lutetia taken with low sub-observer latitudes are required to\nconfirm its c dimension, and to set tighter constraints on its volume.\nThe depth of large-scale concavities was slightly underestimated by KOALA (Fig. 3); estimating the depth of a concavity from profiles only is problematical because the concavity is\nhidden behind its rim. With stereophotoclinometry, is is possible to sense depths. In addition, while KOALA is sensitive to\nlarge-scale concavities, the necessarily limited resolution when\nimaging from a distance of 200 million km means that it is less\nsensitive to small-to-medium-scale concavities. We evaluated\nthe influence of craters on the volume of Lutetia. For that,\nwe used the crater size distribution measured by Marchi et al.\n\n(2011), and estimated their volume as that of a spherical cap\n(Vcrat ), using the average depth-to-diameter ratio measured by\nVincent et al. (2011):\n!\n\u03c0 3 2\n2\n(1)\nVcrat = d D + d\n6 4\nwhere d is the depth of the crater and D its diameter. We\npresent in Fig. 4 the cumulative distribution of the volume encompassed by craters, counted on four geomorphological units\n(see Thomas et al. 2011, , for a detailed definition of the units),\nagainst their diameter. The vast majority of the volume is due\nto the handful of craters with diameters between 10 and 20 km.\nThe total influence of these craters on the volume of Lutetia is\n0.6 \u00b1 0.1%, i.e., the volume of Lutetia would be 0.6% larger if\nthese craters were not included in the 3-D shape model. Extrapolating this value, by considering the area covered by these\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: Cumulative distribution of the volume encompassed by craters as\nfunction of their diameter, for four geomorphological units of Lutetia: Achaia\n(Ac), Baetica (Bt), Narbonensis (Nb), and Noricum (Nr) (see the insert, adapted\nfrom Fig. 1 by Sierks et al. (2011), and also Thomas et al.

For Earth-based observations, however, this will remain a minor source of uncertainty: depending on the methods,\nthe volume accuracy ranges from few percent to few tens of\npercent (see Sect. 1). We discuss in the next section (3.2) the\ninfluence of these craters on the volume accuracy that can be\nreached using KOALA.\n\nplane of the sky. The relative accuracy of the volume determination (\u03b4V/V) can then be determined as follows:\n3 AO \u2212 AK\n\u03b4V\n=\nV\n2 AO\n\n(2)\n\nwhere AK and AO are the areas of the KOALA prediction and\non OSIRIS frame, respectively. Negative and positive \u03b4V respectively indicate an overestimate or underestimate of the volume by the KOALA model. We discarded from the current\nanalysis the images taken close to CA, which have substantial\nphase angle (above 10\u25e6 ), where local topography (e.g., crater\nrims) produce large projected shadows, increasing the uncertainty in the prediction of the terminator position on the surface\nof Lutetia.\nFrom this detailed analysis, we confirm the results from the\noverall comparison presented in Section 3.1: the volume was\nslightly overestimated with KOALA, relative to the results derived from the flyby. But, as visible in Fig. 6, the difference\nbetween the KOALA predictions and the OSIRIS images is almost constant, at about -5%, for all images taken with phase\nangle smaller than \u223c10\u25e6 . The largest deviations, still within the\nuncertainty reported using KOALA, are found for sub-Rosetta\nlatitudes lower than about 40\u25e6 , i.e., for geometries that had not\nbeen observed from Earth with AO. Owing to the restricted\ngeometries of ground-based AO imaging observations to date\n(always close to \"pole-on\", see Drummond et al. (2010) and\nCarry et al. (2010b)), the differences between KOALA predic-\n\n3.2. Detailed analysis\nWe push further the calibration of the KOALA method by\ncomparing comprehensively the KOALA shape model predictions with the very high-spatial-resolution images provided by\nOSIRIS NAC. In the absence of a complete 3-D shape model,\nbased on an entirely independent data set, it is difficult to fully\ncalibrate the volume estimate provided by KOALA. For each\nOSIRIS image, we extracted the profile of the apparent disk of\nLutetia, composed of its limb and its terminator. We produced\nsynthetic views of the KOALA shape model under the same\ngeometry (i.e., as seen from Rosetta, see Fig. 5): phase angle,\nsubsolar point (SSP) and sub-Rosetta point (SRP) coordinates,\nusing the Miriade 9 VO ephemeris generator 10 .\nWe estimate the fit of KOALA predictions to OSIRIS data\nby computing the difference between the projected areas on the\n8 Because the shape of the southern hemisphere is poorly constrained, and\nthe number of craters there unknown, this extrapolated value is only a rough\nestimate.\n9 http://vo.imcce.fr/webservices/miriade/\n10 we used Rosetta flight kernel ORHR\n00122.BSP\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 6: Difference in volume estimated (Eq. 2) from the difference in projected area between the profiles of Lutetia extracted from the OSIRIS images and the\nprediction from the KOALA model (Carry et al. 2010b). The symbols are color-coded as a function of the phase angle. Filled symbols correspond to images where\nthe phase angle was smaller than 10\u25e6 .\n\nThe apparent absence of craters in the KOALA model 11\n(compared to 3-D shape models derived from flyby, e.g.,\nSierks et al. 2011; Preusker et al. 2011) has therefore little influence on the volume estimate and its accuracy. The largest\ncraters seen on Lutetia have a diameter of about 20 km and\na depth of about 2\u20133 km (see Fig. 4, and Marchi et al. 2011;\nVincent et al. 2011), corresponding to the typical accuracy on\nelevation, and are therefore already included in the uncertainty\nenvelop around the KOALA shape model.\nFrom this detailed comparison of OSIRIS frames with\nKOALA predictions, we assert that the KOALA model performed extraordinarily well, especially given two limiting\nfactors related to the observing geometries of the ground-based\nobservations. First, for the imaging observations, Lutetia\nhad an angular diameter of about 0.1\u2032\u2032 , close to the angular\nresolution for which we currently can extract useful shape\ninformation from ground-based telescopes with AO. Second,\nfor the oppositions in 2007 and 2008, Lutetia was positioned\nat diametrically opposite apparent ecliptic coordinates from\nEarth, and because of the high obliquity, we observed Lutetia\nclose to North-pole-on and then close to South-pole-on, and we\nwere not able to achieve a good equatorial view, resulting in a\npoorly determined c-axis (Drummond et al. 2010; Carry et al.\n2010b). We expect to improve that in upcoming observations.\nWe have determined the difference between the KOALA\nshape model and the real topography of Lutetia to be 2 km,\non average. Considering Lutetia's volume-equivalent diameter\n(98 km, see Table 1), this translates into a relative precision on\nthe radii of about 5%. We can therefore expect a conservative\nupper limit of 15% for the accuracy that can be achieved\non volume estimates made by KOALA (including possible\nsystematic effects), although it appears that the measured\nuncertainty (Fig. 6) is closer to 5%. These estimates of the\naccuracy achievable with KOALA are close to our previously\n\ntions and OSIRIS frames may be related to two distinct factors:\none \"inherent\" to KOALA (which is the one we seek to evaluate), and another related to the observing geometry. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to distinguish between these two\neffects. We thus estimate that the inherent uncertainty in the\nKOALA volume is about 5% (Fig. 6). This uncertainty can increase, however, due to unfavorable observing geometries, such\nas we have for the present case of Lutetia.\nIn addition to calibrating the volume estimate, we assess the\naccuracy of the KOALA 3-D shape determination. From the direct comparison of both models (pre- and post-flyby, in Fig. 3),\nwe can already qualitatively assert that KOALA allows accurate 3-D shape determination. However, many different shapes\ncan result in similar volume, and also in similar overall triaxialellipsoid dimensions (which are accurate to a couple of km, see\nSection 3.1). We therefore apply the following criterion (\u03b4R,\nsee Eq. 3) to estimate the local deviation of the KOALA model\nto the real shape of Lutetia, and therefore calibrate quantitatively the KOALA 3-D shape determination:\n\n\u03b4R =\n\nN\n1 X (Oi \u2212 Ki )2\nN i\nOi\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Oi and Ki , respectively, are the OSIRIS and KOALA\nprofile radii of the ith point (out of N describing the OSIRIS\nprofile), measured from an arbitrary center.\nWe present in Fig. 7 the estimate of the local deviation of the\nKOALA predictions to the apparent shape of Lutetia measured\non the OSIRIS NAC images, as a function of the time relative\nto CA. The deviations are limited to about 4 km at maximum,\nand are about 2 km on average (confirmed by the independent\nanalysis of Preusker et al. 2011). The typical accuracy in the\nelevation of each vertex is therefore close to 2 km. This is consistent with the overall comparison presented in Section 3.1,\nbut we show here that not only the overall sizes are accurate to\nabout 2 km, but that this accuracy is maintained at local scales.\n\n11 Although the model does not show round, crater-like, features, KOALA\nallows modeling of concavities, that can be either large impact craters.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 7: Estimate of the local deviation (\u03b4R) between the profiles of Lutetia extracted from the OSIRIS images and the prediction from the KOALA model\n(Carry et al. 2010b).

KOALA and thermal radiometry\n\nTable 2: Albedo (pV ), and thermal inertia (\u0393, in SI units: J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 ) derived using MIRO on-board Rosetta (Gulkis et al. 2011), ground-based data in\ncombination with the shape model derived from Rosetta flyby (O'Rourke et al.\n2011), and ground-based data in combination with the KOALA shape model\n(present study).\n\nAs a supplementary investigation of the capabilities of\nKOALA for the study of a large sample of asteroids from\nground-based observations, we analyze here the thermal properties of (21) Lutetia, using only ground-based information: the KOALA 3-D shape model (Drummond et al. 2010;\nCarry et al. 2010b), and 104 individual thermal measurements\n(O'Rourke et al. 2011, and reference therein), disregarding any\ninformation provided by the flyby of the asteroid by Rosetta.\nWe then compare our results with those derived from the thermal infrared observations acquired by the MIRO instrument\nduring Rosetta flyby (Gulkis et al. 2011). We also comment\non the results obtained by O'Rourke et al. (2011) with the same\ndata set, but using the 3-D shape model derived from Rosetta\nimaging (Sierks et al. 2011).\nMany observations at thermal wavelengths are available:\nLutetia was observed multiple times by several infrared survey\nmissions, like IRAS in 1983, or Akari in 2006/2007, but it was\nalso targeted by different observing campaigns from ground:\nIRTF, ESO-TIMMI2, and from space: Spitzer, Herschel (see\nO'Rourke et al. 2011, , for details on the observing circumstances).\nFirst, we use the spin-vector coordinates provided by\nKOALA to determine the corresponding (lightcurve averaged) cross-sections for all observations that were used to derive the absolute magnitude of Lutetia: H = 7.25 \u00b1 0.01 mag\n(Bowell et al. 1989; Belskaya et al. 2010). All observations\nwere taken with sub-observer latitude between \u221270\u25e6 and \u221285\u25e6 ,\nclose to pole-on geometry, when the apparent average diameter\n\nof Lutetia was around 110\u2013111 km (compared to its volumeequivalent diameter of 98 km, Sierks et al. 2011). The absolute magnitude of Lutetia was therefore slightly overestimated.\nWe can still use it to determine the geometric visual albedo\npV via the relation: log pV = 6.2559 \u2212 2 log d \u2212 0.4H\n(Pravec and Harris 2007, and references therein), providing d\nis the average apparent diameter of Lutetia at the time of the observations. The combination of the KOALA shape model with\nthe published absolute H magnitude leads to pV = 0.19 \u00b1 0.01,\nin excellent agreement with the value derived during Rosetta\nflyby (0.19 \u00b1 0.01, see Sierks et al. 2011).\nSecond, the knowledge of the 3-D shape allows us to correct\nthis bias on the actual H magnitude of Lutetia: Published absolute magnitudes are typically derived from a limited number\nof latitudes of the sub-observer point, and represent therefore\nan approximation only to the real absolute magnitude. Using\nthe knowledge of the 3-D shape model with an absolute size\nscale and the geometric albedo (see above), one can determine\nthe proper geometry-independent H-mag. Indeed, the absolute\nmagnitude is intended to be a general, object-related property,\nrather than an observed quantity valid only for certain geometries (Bowell et al. 1989). The H-mag for Lutetia, based on\nthe KOALA shape model and the geometric visual albedo of\npV = 0.19, is therefore HV = 7.42 \u00b1 0.03.\nWe use this refined H-mag to proceed with radiometric analysis via a TPM code (Lagerros 1996, 1997, see Section 1.3).\n10\n\n\fThis model considers a 1-D heat conduction into the surface,\nbased on realistic surface conditions of illumination provided\nby the KOALA shape model (see O'Rourke et al. 2011, for\ndetails on such computations). As a complementary check of\nthe techniques, we first determine the radiometric size and geometric albedo of Lutetia, regardless of the size information\nprovided by the KOALA shape model (following the method\nby M\u00fcller et al. 2011). The calculation is based on the general thermal properties derived for large main-belt asteroids\n(M\u00fcller and Lagerros 2002), a wavelength-dependent emissivity model, a default thermal inertia \u0393 of 15 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 , and a\ndefault roughness implementation with 60% of the surface covered by craters and an RMS of the surface slopes of 0.7 (see,\ne.g., Lagerros 1996, 1997, for definitions of these quantities).\nThis leads to a radiometric volume-equivalent diameter (based\non a dimensionless version of the KOALA 3-D shape model)\nof 99.8 \u00b1 4.6 km and a geometric albedo pV of 0.198 \u00b1 0.017\n(weighted mean values and standard deviations from the analysis of the 104 individual thermal measurements). These values are in agreement with the pre-flyby estimates (diameter of\n98.3 \u00b1 5.9 km and geometric albedo pV of 0.208 \u00b1 0.025) by\nMueller et al. (2006), using the lightcurve inversion model by\nTorppa et al. (2003). This demonstrates the value of combining\nthermal data with spin and 3-D shape models to derive accurately the diameters and albedos of asteroids.\nFinally, we constrain the thermal inertia of Lutetia by comparing the TPM predictions (using the KOALA 3-D shape\nmodel, including its size estimate) for a range of thermal inertias with the 104 observed thermal measurements. This allows us to find the most probable thermal inertia to explain\nall data simultaneously, i.e., to match the before/after opposition observations as well as the observations taken at the\nshort-wavelength Wien part of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the long-wavelength Rayleigh-Jeans part of\nthe SED. Thermal data also cover the entire rotation of Lutetia and a significant range of sub-Earth latitudes (see the listing of observations in O'Rourke et al. 2011). Thermal inertias\nin the range 5\u201340 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 produce the lowest \u03c72 -values\n(see Fig. 8), indicating the presence of fine-grained regolith\n(Brown and Matson 1987). These values are in agreement\nwith the values measured by Rosetta (< 20 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 , see\nGulkis et al. 2011). The \u03c72 -analysis also shows that one has\nto add substantial roughness on the surface to explain the thermal measurements. The KOALA 3-D shape model without any\nsmall-scale roughness cannot provide acceptable \u03c72 -values.\nThe prediction made using the combination of the KOALA\nand TPM models provides a good fit to all 104 measurements\nof Lutetia in the thermal infrared. There is a discrepancy, however, for a given observing geometry that could be solved by the\naddition of a plateau/hill to the 3-D shape model, whose size remains within the quoted 3-D shape uncertainty as discussed by\nO'Rourke et al. (2011).\nFrom this detailed comparison of ground-based with flyby\nresults, KOALA has been shown to be a powerful technique\nfor the study of asteroids from the ground, not only for\nsize/shape/spin, but now also for thermal properties. The validated (see Section 3) 3-D shape models, determined using\n\nFigure 8: Thermal inertia determination using the KOALA shape model and\nground-based observations. We use four values of surface roughness (default\nroughness means 60% of the surface is covered by craters and the RMS of\nthe surface slopes is 0.7; see detail in O'Rourke et al. 2011) for thermal inertia\nranging from very low to moderate (1\u2013100 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 ).\n\nKOALA, allow the study of the surface properties (e.g., albedo,\nthermal inertia) in great detail, and the results are consistent\nwith those derived from the flyby.\n5. Concluding remarks: the future of KOALA\nThe flyby of (21) Lutetia by ESA Rosetta provided a\nspectacular demonstration of the capabilities of the KOALA\nalgorithm. Spin-vector coordinates were found to be accurate within two degrees, 3-D shape modeling to better than\n2 km (local topography), and dimensions to 2%. Volume\nestimates provided by KOALA are seen to be accurate to\nbetter than 10%. The thermal properties (albedo and thermal\ninertia) of Lutetia determined using a thermophysical model\nin conjunction with the KOALA shape model agree with the\nRosetta-flyby-derived values, within the quoted uncertainties.\nThese levels of accuracy on the spin and 3-D shape/size are\ntypical for large main-belt asteroids, and not specific to Lutetia.\nAlthough it was extensively observed from the ground, being a\nspacecraft target, the number of lightcurves was similar to that\nof other large main-belt asteroids and the geometry of imaging\nobservations was not particularly favorable (i.e., mostly close\nto \"pole-on\").\nThis ability of KOALA to determine the volume of main-belt\nasteroids of size \u223c100 km with an accuracy of about 10% opens\nthe possibility for study of a larger set of small bodies using\nEarth-based observations. For instance, it can be expected\nto help efforts to better understand the densities of asteroids\nbelonging to different taxonomic classes (DeMeo et al. 2009).\nThis will be assisted by mass estimates from about 150\u2013200\nasteroids that will be determined from gravitational deflections\nobserved by the upcoming ESA Gaia astrometry mission\n(Mouret et al. 2007), and the ever-growing number of known\nbinary asteroids. During the first stages of the encounter\n11\n\n\fof Rosetta with its main target, comet 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko in 2014, we also plan to use a KOALA-style\nanalysis of the first, low-resolution, resolved images to quickly\nproduce a shape/size model. This will support the mission\nscience until a full high-resolution model can be derived.\nThe present implementation of KOALA allows the combined use of optical lightcurves (including sparse photometry),\nprofiles from disk-resolved images, and chords from stellar\noccultations. We continue the development of KOALA toward\nthe use of more data modes (e.g., interferometry, thermal\nradiometry) to increase the number of possible targets, and to\nset better constraints on targets observable only with certain\ntechniques. Using different wavelength ranges, in particular\nin the thermal infrared, opens the possibility of deriving additional physical properties, like albedo or thermal inertia. We\nalso plan to incorporate additional cross-checks and constraints\non the inversion, such as rigorous attention to differences in the\nspatial resolution of input images, to improve the confidence\non the non-convex features and details.\n\nwas supported, in part, by the NASA Planetary Astronomy and\nNSF Planetary Astronomy Programs (Merline PI), and the work\nof J. \u010eurech was supported by the grant GACR 209/10/0537 of\nthe Czech Science Foundation.
