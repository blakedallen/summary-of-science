The\ntotal number of emitted photons also increases as the 't Hooft coupling weakens.\n\nIntroduction. The analysis of data from heavy ion\ncollision experiments at RHIC and LHC indicates that\nthe quark-gluon plasmas (QGPs) produced are in the\nstrongly-coupled regime [1], where the 't Hooft coupling\ngoverning the interactions of the microscopic constituents\nof the plasma is larger than one. Being electricallycharged, these microscopic constituents will emit photons. The number of photons emitted with a given momentum, i.e. the photoemission spectrum, yields valuable information about the structure of the plasma. A\ntheoretical study of this spectrum at strong coupling is\ntherefore an essential step for investigating the QGP.\nGauge/string duality lends itself perfectly to such a computation, because it allows the investigation of stronglycoupled gauge theories in terms of their weakly-coupled\nsupergravity dual description [2]. Although there is no\ncomplete string theory dual model which accounts for all\nthe relevant properties of QCD, the microscopic theory\ngoverning the behavior of plasma produced at RHIC and\nLHC, one can attempt to approach the real world using\nthe holographic dual of the large\u2212N SU (N ) N = 4 super\nYang-Mills (SYM) plasma. Moreover, holography stipulates that \u03bb in the gauge theory maps to \u03b1\u2032\u22122 in the string\ndual, so that the minimal supergravity (i.e. the zerothorder string theory description in a small-curvature expansion), obtained for \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, corresponds to the gauge\ntheory at \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. With these two caveats in mind,\nthe work of [3] considered two limits: photoemission\nfrom infinitely strongly-coupled SYM plasma, tackled via\nminimal type IIB supergravity on the AdS-Schwarzschild\nblack hole AdSBH \u00d7 S 5 , and photoemission from weaklycoupled SYM plasma, computed using the traditional\ntools of perturbative quantum field theory. The realworld QGP lies somewhere in between these two illuminating yet unrealistic regimes. Our aim in this letter is to\ncompute the photoemission rate of N = 4 SYM plasma\nat large finite \u03bb. We work in the holographic dual ex-\n\ntended by the inclusion of the full O(\u03b1\u20323 ) type IIB string\ntheory corrections to the supergravity action. The relation \u03bb \u223c \u03b1\u2032\u22122 immediately dictates that the corrections\nto the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e result start at O(\u03bb\u22123/2 ). We compute\ncharacteristic properties of the photoemission spectrum\nat large finite \u03bb, such as the evolution of the height and\nposition of the photoemission peak as a function of \u03bb.\nWe thereby quantify the interpolation between the photoemission spectrum from strongly-coupled plasma and\nthat from weakly-coupled plasma.\nPhotoemission rate and spectral function. N = 4 SYM\ntheory is a supersymmetric gauge theory with gluons,\nfermions and scalars all in the adjoint representation of\nSU (N ), and a (global) R-symmetry group SU (4). To\nmodel electromagnetism in this theory, one of the U (1)\nsubgroups of the R-symmetry group is gauged with coupling e. The Lagrangian can then be written as [3]:\n1\nL = LSY M + eJ\u03bcem A\u03bc \u2212 F 2 ,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere LSY M is the Lagrangian of N = 4 SYM theory,\nand the interactions internal to this Lagrangian are governed by the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb = gY2 M N . The field A\u03bc\nis the photon (introduced by hand), with kinetic term F 2 ,\nand J\u03bcem is the electromagnetic current. The number of\nphotons produced by a thermally equilibrated plasma per\nunit time per unit volume is given by\nd\u0393\u03b3\n\u03b1em\n=\nk nb (k) \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd (k) ,\ndk\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k is the 3-momentum of the (on-shell) photon,\nnb (k) = 1/(ek/T \u2212 1), T is the temperature, and \u03b1em \u2261\ne2 /4\u03c0. This holds to all orders in \u03bb, and to leading order\nin e. The quantity \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd (k) is the light-like spectral density\nof the plasma defined via the retarded electromagnetic\n\n\f2\ncurrent correlator R\u03bc\u03bd as \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122ImR\u03bc\u03bd , where\nZ\nR\u03bc\u03bd (k) = \u2212i d4 x eiK.X \u0398(t) < [J\u03bcem (x), J\u03bdem (0)] > ,\n\n(3)\n\u0398(t) is the step function and K = (k, ~k), with k = |~k|.\nWe wish to compute R\u03bc\u03bd using holography, but we\ndo not have the holographic dual of the theory defined\nby Eq.(1); we do, however, have the holographic dual of\npure N = 4 SYM. The crucial point is that, to leading\norder in e, the electromagnetic current J\u03bdem = J\u03bd , where\nJ\u03bd is purely the R-symmetry current associated with the\nU (1) subgroup. Therefore, the two-point function of the\nelectromagnetic current can be replaced by the two-point\nfunction of the R-symmetry current, computed entirely\nwithin the N = 4 SYM itself [3]. Our aim in this paper\nis to compute the retarded correlator of the R-symmetry\ncurrents of N = 4 SYM at strong 't Hooft coupling,\nretrieve the spectral function \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd , and insert the latter\ninto Eq.(2) to obtain the photoemission rate. Given that\nwe wish to keep \u03bb strong yet finite, we must therefore\nwork in the supergravity dual to N = 4 SYM plasma\nextended by the addition of finite \u03b1\u2032 corrections.\nType IIB string theory setup at O(\u03b1\u20323 ). The type IIB\n0\nsupergravity action corrected to O(\u03b1\u20323 ) is SIIB = SIIB\n+\n\u03b1\u2032\nSIIB , where\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n10\n0\n(F5 )\nd x \u2212G R10 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6) \u2212\nSIIB = 2\n2\u03ba10\n2\n4.5!\n(4)\nwhere \u03c6 is the dilaton, F5 the five-form, and R10 is the\ncurvature. The leading 't Hooft coupling corrections are\n\u03b1\u2032\ncontained in SIIB\n, and given schematically by [4, 5]\nZ\n\u221a\n3\n\u03b3R6\n4\n\u03b1\u2032\nSIIB\n= 2\n(5)\nd10 x \u2212G e\u2212 2 \u03c6 (C + T ) ,\n2\u03ba10\nwhere \u03b3 = 81 \u03b6(3)(\u03b1\u2032 /R2 )3 = 81 \u03b6(3)\u03bb\u22123/2 , with R4 =\ngY2 M N \u03b1\u20322 and \u03b6 is the Riemann Zeta function. C is the\n10D Weyl tensor, and Tabcdef is defined as\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 +\n+\n+ mn\n+\n+ mn\ni\u2207a Fbcdef\n+\n,\nFabcmn Fdef\n\u2212 3Fabf\nmn Fdec\n16\nwhere the RHS is antisymmetrized in [a, b, c] and [d, e, f ]\nand symmetrized with respect to interchange of abc \u2194\ndef [5]. Also, F + = 12 (1 + \u2217)F5 . The operators in Eq.(5)\nare dimension-eight operators obtained by various independent contractions of C and T that can be found in [5].\nThe background solution to this action is the corrected\nmetric GMN [6], with f (u) = 1 \u2212 u2 ,\n\u0010 r \u00112 1\n\u0001\n0\nds2 =\n\u2212f (u) K 2 (u) dt2 + d~x2\nR\nu\nR2\nP 2 (u) du2 + R2 L2 (u) d\u03a925 ,\n(6)\n+ 2\n4u f (u)\nwhere d\u03a925 is the line element on the S 5 , and\nK(u) = e\u03b3 [a(u)+4b(u)] , P (u) = e\u03b3 b(u) , L(u) = e\u03b3 c(u) ,\n\nwhere the exponents are give by the expressions\n10005 6\n1625 2\nu \u2212 175 u4 +\nu ,\n8\n16\n325 2 1075 4 4835 6\nb(u) =\nu +\nu \u2212\nu ,\n8\n32\n32\n15\nc(u) =\n(1 + u2 ) u4 .\n32\n\na(u) = \u2212\n\n(7)\n\nThe extremality parameter is r0 = \u03c0T R2 /(1 + 265\u03b3/16),\nwhere T is the physical equilibrium temperature of the\nplasma. The boundary of the AdS space is at u = 0, and\nthe horizon of the black hole at u = 1. In addition, both\nF5 and the dilaton have non-trivial background solutions,\nbut their explicit forms are of no consequence in this\nwork, as we explain shortly. The crucial point is that the\ntensor T is zero for the background solution [4].\nThe vector perturbation. We now pursue the usual\nrecipe involved in all holographic computations: firstly,\nperturb the supergravity background along the directions\n\u03c8 which are dual to the field theory operators J whose\ncorrelation functions we are interested in, and plug the\nperturbed background into SIIB . This yields the action\nS(\u03c8) of the perturbation \u03c8. Then, solve the equations of\nmotion (EOM) of S(\u03c8) subject to \u03c8 = \u03c80 on the boundary of the space u = 0, and evaluate the on-shell action\nfor these solutions, giving Z(\u03c80 ), the generating functional of correlation functions of the operators J . Differentiating Z(\u03c80 ) twice with respect to \u03c80 yields < J .J >,\nand we are done. The details of this prescription in real\ntime are described in [7]. For the present case the perturbation field \u03c8 dual to the R-symmetry currents J\u03bc of\nthe 4D theory is the vector perturbation A\u03bc of the gravitational background obtained as a solution of the EOM\nof SIIB . The vector perturbation A\u03bc perturbs the metric\nand the F5 solution, yielding\nds2 = gmn dxm dxn +\n\u0015\n3 \u0014\nX\n2\nd\u03bc2i + \u03bc2i (d\u03c6i + \u221a A\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 ,\nR2 L(u)2\n3\ni=1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere gmn = Gmn for m, n \u2208 [0, 4] and \u03bci are the direction cosines for the sphere, and\n!\n3\nR3 L(u)3 X 2\n4\n\u221a\nd\u03bci \u2227 d\u03c6i \u2227 \u2217F2 , (9)\nF5 = \u2212 \u01eb +\nR\n3\ni=1\nwhere F2 = dA is the Abelian field strength of A\u03bc and\n\u01eb is a deformation of the volume form of the metric of\nthe AdSBH . The Hodge duals \u2217 and \u2217 are taken with\nrespect to the 10D metric and 5D-AdSBH metric, respectively. Notice that the \u03b3 \u2192 0 limits of Eq.(8, 9)\nare known exactly, see for instance [8]. Both of Eq.(8,\n9) are correct to linear order in \u03b3. We will insert these\n0\n\u03b1\u2032\nAns\u00e4tze into SIIB = SIIB\n+ SIIB\nbelow, obtaining an\neffective Lagrangian for A\u03bc which is at most quadratic\nin A\u03bc . Two important points must be stated to this\n\n\f3\nend, dictated by the fact that we work strictly to lin0\near order in \u03b3. For insertion into SIIB\n, we require the\n0\nAns\u00e4tze to linear order in \u03b3. However, SIIB\nonly contains quadratic powers of F5 and, therefore, the \u01eb part of\nthe F5 Ansatz cannot contribute to the quadratic effec\u03b1\u2032\ntive Lagrangian of A\u03bc . On the other hand, SIIB\ncontains\noperators which are higher than quadratic in F5 , so here\n\u01eb can contribute to the quadratic Lagrangian for A\u03bc , but\n\u03b1\u2032\nthe crucial point is that SIIB\ncontains an explicit factor\nof \u03b3 already, and so we only require \u01eb to zero order in\n\u03b3. This is of course nothing but the volume form on the\nAdS space [8]. The incredibly simplifying upshot of these\nobservations is that we do not require the O(\u03b3) terms in \u01eb\nfor our computation. This is why we do not care to state\nthe explicit form of \u01eb. All we need to know is lim\u03b3\u21920 \u01eb.\nThe same observations can be made for the contribution\nto the effective Lagrangian of A\u03bc of operators containing\nthe dilaton (and in fact any other field which is trivial in\nthe zero order background supergravity solution). These\nstatements make the following work possible.\nThe effective Lagrangian of the vector perturbation.\nWithout loss of generality, we may set the photon momenta to (k, 0, 0, k). In order to study the photoemission\nrate we only need to consider the transverse fluctuation\nAx (t, x, u). Inserting the Ans\u00e4tze of Eq.(8, 9) into SIIB ,\nand integrating out the S 5 , we obtain a complicated Lagrangian for Ax (t, x, u). This action can be coverted into\na more useful form by use of p\nthe following field redefinitions: write \u03a8(u) = Ak (u)/( f (u)[1 + \u03b3p(u)]), where\np(u) is a polynomial in u beginning at O(u2 ) and Ak (u)\nis the Fourier transform of Ax (t, x, u). This takes us into\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger basis, such that the action is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nZ 1\nd4 k\n1\nN 2 r02\n\u03a8L\u03a8\n+\n\u2202\n\u03a6\n(10)\ndu\nS=\u2212\nu\n16\u03c0 2 R4\n(2\u03c0)4 0\n2\nwhere L \u03a8(u) = 0 is the EOM \u03a8\u2032\u2032 (u) = V (u)\u03a8(u), where\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger-like potential is given by\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b3\nV (u) = \u2212 2\nf (u) [\u221211700\n1 + q2 u \u2212\nf (u)\n144\n\n+2098482u2 \u2212 4752055u4 + 1838319u6 + q 2 u\n\u0013\n\u0001\u0003\n2\n4\n, (11)\n\u00d7(\u221216470 + 245442u + 1011173u\n\nand q = k/(2\u03c0T ). The boundary term can be simplified\nto \u03a6 = \u03a8\u2032 (u)\u03a8(u) . We solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nanalytically for the region k \u226a T , the so-called hydrodynamic regime of the plasma, and the high-energy regime\nk \u226b T . In the intermediate momentum region we resort to a numerical solution of the EOM. Once we have\nthe solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the trace of the\nspectral function is given by:\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u2032\n265\n\u03a8 (u)\nN 2T 2\n1\u2212\n, (12)\n\u03b3 Im\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (k) =\n2\n8\n\u03a8(u) u=0\n\u0001\nwith 1 \u2212 265\n8 \u03b3 coming from the factors of r0 in Eq.(10).\n\nThe EOM of the vector perturbation. We solve the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation using perturbation theory. Write\n\u03a8(u) = \u03a80 (u) + \u03b3\u03a81 (u), and insert into the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, separating the powers of \u03b3. The equation\nfor\n\u0001\n\u03a80 (u) is given by \u03a8\u2032\u20320 (u) = \u2212f \u22122 (u)(1 + q 2 u) \u03a80 (u),\nand solves to give\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03a80 (u) = (1 \u2212 u)\u2212 2 (1+iq) (1 + u)\u2212 2 (1+q)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1 + i)q\n(1 + i)q\n1\u2212u\n.

The trace of the spectral function \u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (k) is\n\u0015\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013 \u2032\nN 2T 2\n\u03a8\u20320 \u03a81\n\u03a8\u20321\n265\n\u03a80\n+\u03b3 \u2212\n+\nIm\n1\u2212\n\u03b3\n2\n8\n\u03a80\n\u03a80 \u03a80\n\u03a80\nu=0\nwhich is exact to linear order in \u03b3. We note that \u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (k)\nat \u03bb \u2192 \u221e is known [3], so our task here is to compute\nthe 't Hooft coupling corrections to that result.\nAsymptotics of the spectral function. \u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (k) can be\nevaluated analytically for low- and high-momentum, and\nnumerically for the remaining momentum domain. We\ndo not discuss the details of the computations, referring\nthe reader to [3], and we simply display the results:\n\u0001\n(\n3\n1 + 14993\nq\u226a1\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (q)\n9 \u03b3 q + O(q )\n2\n5/6\n\u0393\n.\n(3)\n3\n2/3\n1 2 2 =\n+ O(1) q \u226b 1\n2 \u0393( 1 ) (1 + 5\u03b3) q\n2N T\n3\n(14)\nThe coefficient of q in the low-q regime of Eq.(14) means\nthat the electrical conductivity of the strongly-coupled\n\u0001\nplasma is enhanced by a factor 1 + 14993\n9 \u03b3 due to the finite \u03bb corrections [9]. This is as expected from the perturbative computations in [3]: the weakly-coupled plasma\nhas a larger mean-free-path per collision, allowing more\nefficient diffusion of electric charge, and hence a higher\nelectrical conductivity. The high-q region however, poses\na question that we (as of yet) cannot answer: the authors\nof [3] claim that the spectral function at weak coupling\nshould go like q 1/2 in the ultraviolet (UV). Given that\nthe spectral function at \u03bb \u2192 \u221e goes like q 2/3 , in that\nregime one would have expected our result in Eq.(14) to\ndisplay some smooth interpolation between q 1/2 and q 2/3 .\nWe do not obtain such an interpolation, finding instead\nthat the finite coupling corrections do not change the\nq-dependence in the UV. Moreover, we find an enhancement by a factor (1 + 5\u03b3) in that regime (see also [10]).\nThe fact that the leading q behavior is unchanged by the\ncorrections could have been seen from the Schr\u00f6dingerlike potential in Eq.(11): the only q-dependence is q 2 ,\nidentically to the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e case. Terms like q 4 , which\ncould have changed the high\u2212q functional dependence of\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (q), vanish. We shall revisit this point below.\nThe photoemission spectrum. We plug the obtained\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bc (k) into Eq.(2) to give the photoemission spectrum.\nWe display the results in figure 1. Clearly, the corrected\nresult at strong coupling approaches the weakly-coupled\n\n\f4\nRate\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\nk\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nT\n\nFIG. 1.\nThe photoemission rate d\u0393\u03b3 /dk in units of\n0.01\u03b1em N 2 T 3 for different values of \u03bb, as a function of k/T .\nSolid, dashed, and small-dashed lines correspond to decreasing values of \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, 75 and 50, respectively. The dotted\nline to the extreme left is the weak-coupling result at \u03bb = 0.5\ntaken from [3].\n\nresult (taken from reference [3]). Firstly, the corrected\ncurves exhibit a steeper tangent at the origin, due to the\nenhancement\n\u0001 of the electric conductivity by the factor\n1 + 14993\n\u03b3\nin Eq.(14). Secondly, the peak of the pho9\ntoemission is enhanced by the corrections, and the momentum of maximal emission shifts towards the infrared\n(IR), taking the corrected curves closer to the weakly coupled result. Simple numerical analysis on the light-like\nspectral function yields that the maximal rate is given by\n\u0015 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n265\nd\u0393\u03b3\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3 2 ) ,\n\u2243 0.0156695 1 + 1115.3 \u2212\ndk max\n8\n(15)\nin units of \u03b1em N 2 T 3 , where we have made explicit the\nfactor \u2212265/8\u03b3 coming from the overall normalization of\nthe action. The position of the peak kmax is\n2\n\nkmax \u2243 1.48469 (1 \u2212 842.425\u03b3) T + O(\u03b3 ) .\n\n(16)\n\nThis quantity can analytically be shown to be independent of the overall normalization of the action, making\nit an excellent candidate for comparing disparate gauge\ntheories. One more quantity which is of interest is the\ntotal number of photons emitted, given by the area under\nthe curves in figure 1. This is enhanced by a factor\n\u0015\n\u0014\nNtotal (\u03b3)\n265\n\u03b3 + O(\u03b3 2 ) ,\n(17)\n\u2243 1 + 461.941 \u2212\nNtotal (0)\n8\ndue to the fact that the weakly-coupled theory dominates\nin the IR, where Bose-suppression (due to nb (k)) is small.\nWe finally make two comments about the behavior of\nthe photoemission rate for high q. Firstly, there is a (\u03bbindependent) crossover point around k/T \u223c 2.92, where\nthe corrected curves dip below the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e result. This\n\nis expected from the weak-coupling computations of [3].\nWhat is surprising, as we mentioned above, is that the\nasymptotic values of the \u03bb-corrected curves for large k/T\nare given by (1 + 5\u03b3) times the infinite coupling result,\nas in Eq.(14) (note that the domain of figure 1 does not\nextend to cover this asymptotic behaviour). This means\nthat the finite-\u03bb corrections enhance the photoemission\nrate in the deep UV regime, contrary to the expectations\nof [3]. Obviously, we are not guaranteed that the weaklycoupled result should be approached by strongly-coupled\ncorrections computed in perturbation theory, especially\nnot for a situation where the functional dependence on\nmomenta is expected to be different, so we are not unduly\nconcerned by this apparent discrepancy. It would be very\nrevealing to understand these cross-over points, as well as\ntheir scaling with \u03bb. An important extension of our work\nwould be to determine if the universality found in [11] for\nthe energy-momentum spectral functions operates for the\nR-symmetry current spectral function computed here.\nWe thank Gert Aarts, Alex Buchel, Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez,\nMiguel Paulos and Jorge Russo for valuable comments.\nThe work of M.S. has been partially supported by the\nCONICET, the ANPCyT-FONCyT Grant PICT-200700849, and the CONICET Grant PIP-2010-0396.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n\nbabiker@thphys.ox.ac.uk\nmartin@fisica.unlp.edu.ar\nE.
