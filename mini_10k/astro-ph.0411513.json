Driven by GR reaction, sparsely, the binary separation reduces, the WD overflows its Roche lobe and the mass transfer drives unstable the\naccretion disk around the NS. As the binary circular orbital period is a multiple integer number (m) of the period of the WD fundamental mode (Pons et al. 2002), the WD is since long\npulsating at its fundamental mode; and most of its harmonics, due to the tidal interaction with\nits NS orbital companion. Hence, when the powerful irradiation glows onto the WD; from the\nfireball ejected as part of the disk matter slumps onto the NS, it is partially absorbed. This huge\nenergy excites other WD radial (p-mode) pulsations (Podsiadlowski 1991,1995). After each\nmass-transfer episode the binary separation (and orbital period) is augmented significantly\n(Deloye & Bildsten 2003; Al\u00e9cyan & Morsink 2004) due to the binary's angular momentum\nredistribution. Thus a new adiabatic inspiral phase driven by GR reaction starts which brings\nthe binary close again, and the process repeats. This model allows to explain most of SGRs\nobservational features: their recurrent activity, energetics of giant superoutbursts and quiescent stages, and particularly the intriguing subpulses discovered by BeppoSAX (Feroci et al.\n1999), which are suggested here to be overtones of the WD radial fundamental mode (see the\naccompanying paper: Mosquera Cuesta 2004b).\nKey words: Binaries: close - gamma-rays: theory - relativity - stars: individual (SGR\n1900+14) - stars: neutron - white dwarfs - stars: oscillations\n\n1 ASTROPHYSICAL MOTIVATION\nThe giant outburst from SGR1900+14 on 27 August (1998), hereafter GRB980827, was an extraordinary event in many respects.\nAside from the huge energy released (Eout > 3 \u00d7 1044 erg) on\nsuch a short timescale (\u223c 0.1 s), the clear identification in its\nlight curve (and power spectral density) of a main pulsation period (P \u223c 5.16 s) and an accurately measure interpulse set (\u223c 1 s\nof interval), as discovered by BeppoSAX (Feroci et al. 1999), has\nchallenged the current views on SGRs. This behavior, Feroci et al.\n(1999) advanced, is unexpected and quite difficult to explain in the\nmagnetar framework. The GRB980827 subpulses seem to be overtones of the fundamental frequency f0 = 0.194 Hz (Feroci et al.\n1999). As shown by Mosquera Cuesta (2004b), where a consistent\nscenario to explain the observed SGR1900+14 modulations was\npresented, when looking at the GRB980827 lightcurve perhaps we\nare seeing the full WD pulsation spectrum. In these lines, it would\nbe crucial if the propeller model by Marsden, Rothschild & Lingenfelter (2001) and Alpar (1999,2000) could provide a suitable ex-\n\nplanation for the pulsational modes observed in GRB980827, since\nthis way we can discriminate among accretion models.\nThe rapid risetime (0.25 s), energetics and subpulses seen by\nBeppoSAX in this powerful event are characteristics challenging\nthe magnetar view. According to the magnetar scenario (Thompson & Duncan 1995,1996) the typical (crustal stored stress) energy\nof an outburst from an SGR source should be \u223c 1039 erg (de Freitas Pacheco 1998) if one expects the source not to be destroyed by\nthe explosion. Energies as Eout or higher can be obtained at the\nexpense of destructing practically the whole crust of the NS undergoing the starquake (de Freitas Pacheco 1998) or through magnetic reconnection (Thompson & Duncan 1995,1996; Woods et al.\n1999). However, a NS with no crust is fully unstable, and should explode (Colpi, Shapiro & Teukolsky 1993). Consequently, the source\ncould not repeat anymore.\nThe problems for the magnetar model do not stop there. After a burster phase in 1996, Marsden, Rothschild & Lingenfelter\n(1999, see also Harding, Contopoulos & Kazanas 1999; Murakami\n\n\f2\n\nMosquera Cuesta\n\net al. 1999) found that the pulsar doubled its period derivative, \u1e56 ,\nwhich would suggest the pulsar magnetic field energy had augmented \u223c 100% during the outburst, what clearly opposes the magnetar scenario. They concluded that the SGRs spindown is due not\nto dipole radiation but to another mechanism. Thus, the \u1e56 could\nnot be an estimate of the magnetic field strength, nor evidence for\na magnetar. More recently, Rothschild, Marsden & Lingenfelter\n(2001) argued that the unexpected occurrence of most of the SGRs\n(and AXPs) in the denser phases of the interstellar medium effectively rules out the magnetar model for their origin, since in that\nmodel the NS endowes a supercritical field as an intrinsic property, with no plausible relation to external environments. In addition to those shortcomings of the magnetar scenario, very recently\nP\u00e9rez Mart\u0131\u0301nez et al. (2003) rose questions on the formation of\nthe magnetar itself by invoking quantum-mechanical effects on the\nstructural stability of the hypermagnetised star, while Rezzolla &\nAkhmedov (2004) demonstrated that a fundamental change in the\nPacini's spindown law appears when describing the electromagnetic fields in full general relativity.\nThen the issue is contentious: what are these objects?\nIn this letter we suggest that SGRs may not be related to magnetars, as opposed to claims by Kouveliotou et al. (1998,1999);\nHurley et al. (1999a,b,c); Murakami et al. (1999); Mazets et al.\n(1999a,b); etc. Instead, it is shown that SGRs may be extremely\nclose (tight) relativistic X-ray binaries with periods near a few tens\nof seconds (see Table.1)1 , in which sparsely the rate of shrinking of\nthe binary separation dominates over the massive WD rate of contraction below its equilibrium radius (Fryer et al. 1998b), and mass\ntransfer ensues. To trigger a superoutburst the system is brought\ncloser again due to GR emission. In a timescale \u2206Trep 6 10 yr\nthe process described above restarts governing the binary dynamics leading to a new outburst.\n\nTable 1.

Systems with\neven more shorter, near tens of a second, depending on the common envelope efficiency parameter \u03b1CE , can be formed (see also\nPodsiadlowski 1995,2000; Ergma, Lundgren & Cordes 1997; Tauris, van den Heuvel & Savonije 2000). This view gives us some\ninsight on the SGRs former evolution. Perhaps those systems come\nfrom a previous Thorne-Zytkow object in which a complete exhaustion or ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the red giant\nstar (lifetime \u03c4RG \u223c 104 yr) occurred once the NS is engulfed\n1\n\nIt is worth quoting that Kouveliotou's team (1999) found (0.05 cycles)\nsystematic departures of pulse phases from the best-fit ephemeris. Due to\nits potentiality, searches for an orbital period in the SGR 1900+14 August,\n1998 observations were performed. They divided the data set in subsets\nof 400 seconds, and conducted searches in the range: 103 \u2212 106 s. No\nsinusoidal modulation was found. If our model is on the right track, the\nnegative result is not surprising for a shorter period for the SGR 1900+14\nbinary, 21.4 6 PSGRs 6 65 s, but expected. Thus, it is likely that the\norbital signature looked for remains embedded in the data subsets that were\nused for.\n\nin a common-envelope evolutionary phase caused by shrinking of\nthe orbit due to gravitational-wave (GW) radiation-reaction effects.\nThis process leaves the giant companion's bare Helium (or CNO)\ncore, the WD, in a tight orbit with a rapidly spinning massive NS.\nWe suggest this may explain why SGRs are surrounded by nebulae\nresembling supernovae remnants. The NS high mass being a consequence of the Thorne-Zytkow object latest stage, while the NS\nspin stems from its former LMXB evolution (van Paradijs 1995a,b).\nA similar evolutionary path was described by Ergma, Lundgren &\nCordes (1997), see also Tauris, van den Heuvel & Savonije (2000).\nErgma et al. showed that these systems may undergo a second mass\ntransfer transient around periods of 5 minutes or less, being the\nsource observed as an X-ray binary again. The final fate could be\nthe binary coalescence. We also note that in the last few years a\nlarge number of systems of this sort have been discovered (Edwards\n& Bailes 2001; Tauris & Sennels 2000; Tauris, van den Heuvel &\nSavonije 2000, a large sample is collected in this reference; Deloye\n& Bildsten 2003, Al\u00e9cyan & Morsink 2004), and their formation\nhave been modelled with great details (Ergma, Lundgren & Cordes\n1997; Tauris, van den Heuvel & Savonije 2000). At this late stages\nGW dominate the binary dynamics and secularly shorten its period\nto those we suggest here.\n\n\fA white dwarf-neutron star relativistic binary model...\n\n3\n\n2.2 SGRs as interacting binaries\nBy the time the WD-NS relativistic binary reaches the critical separation transient mass transfer occurs.2 In a rather catastrophic\nepisode, which repeats sparsely any: \u2206TSGRs 6 10 yr (estimated\nbelow), the WD starts to transfer mass onto a low-magnetised\nrapidly rotating massive (2 M\u2299 ) NS, via the formation of a thick\ndense massive accretion disk (TDD) very close to the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO). The disk becomes unstable due to\ngravitational runaway or Jeans instability, partially slumps and inspirals onto the NS. The abrupt supercritical mass accretion onto\nthe NS releases quasi-thermal powerful \u03b3-rays, a fireball to say,\nwhile triggers non-radial NS oscillations which emit fluid-mode\nGW (see Mosquera Cuesta et al. 1998). A parcel of the accretion\nenergy illuminates with hard radiation the WD perturbing its hydrostatic equilibrium. The WD absorbs this huge energy at its interior and atmosphere and begins to radially pulsate (p-modes) in\naddition to its long before excited fundamental mode and higher\nharmonics (overtones: Podsiadlowski 1991,1995), see Mosquera\nCuesta (2004b), and Tables 2-3, below.\nThe accretion rate from the WD onto the TDD, to be replenished during the periastron passage \u2206Tp\u2212a around the NS, can\nroughly be estimated from an idealized drop model in which we\nassume that the total mass contained in a sphere of radius equivalent to half the WD tidal height Htide (Shapiro\n& Teukolsky\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1983) drops onto the NS: Htide = RW D\n\n\u0002 MN S \u00031/3\n\n\u22121\n\nMW D\n\n6\n\n1100 km. Using this, and a mean density \u03c1\u0304W D = 4 \u00d7 10 g cm\nwe obtain the WD mass transfer rate\nD\n\u1e40 W\nT DD \u223c\n\n\u0014\n\nWD\nMLost\n6 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299\n\n\u0015\u0014\n\n10s\n\u2206Tp\u2212a\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2206Tvisc\n\n\u0014\n\nR2\n2\nH \u03b1\u03a9K\n\n\u0015\n\n\u22121/2\n\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\n\ns,\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03b1, H and \u03a9K the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter, disc\nheight scale and Keplerian angular frequency, respectively.

Both results match\nvery nicely the power emitted in GRB980827 (Mazets et al. 1999;\nFeroci et al. 1999). It also gets close to total energy that can be\nreleased in GRBs from galactic sources, as discussed by Fryer et\nal. (1998b).\n\n2.3 A possible signature of a WD in SGR1900+14\n\n3/2\n\nMNS R6\n\u03b10.1\n\nT DD\nwhere \u1e40NS\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 s\u22121 is the mass deposited\nat radius R6 (in units of 106 cm). Thus, we conjecture that giant\noutbursts from SGRs, like GRB980827, are triggered when a large\npart of the accretion torus plunges onto the NS.\nScaling these results for the difference in gravitational potential between a BH and a NS (\u03a6NS /\u03a6BH \u223c 0.2), in coalescence\nwith a WD (Klu\u017aniak & Lee 1998; Klu\u017aniak 1998), and using the\nEq.(1) given by Mosquera Cuesta et al. (1998) to estimate the peak\ntemperature achieved when the accreted matter crashes on the NS\nsurface, we get\n\n,\n\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 s\u22121 , (1)\n\n\u22123\n\n(3)\n\n6\n\n\u22123\n\nwhere we have used results for RW D \u223c 4.7 \u00d7 103 km by Suh\n& Mathews (2000) and Eggleton's theory (1983), see below.\nSince essentially viscosity dominates the TDD hydrodynamics, in general one can estimate the viscous timescale (Frank, King\n& Raine 1992) for it to drive unstable the TDD as (Popham,\nWoosley & Fryer 1999)\nR2\n\u223c\n=\n\u03bd\n\nD\nMW\n1/2 \u22123/2\nD\nT DD\n= 0.37\u03b10.1 M W\n,\nT DD MNS R6\n\u2206Tvisc\n\nDD\n\u1e40 TNS\n\u223c\n\nWe address the readers to a couple of papers by Deloye & Bildsten (2003)\nand Al\u00e9cyan & Morsink (2004); and references therein, where a similar\nand detailed study of the dynamics of these kind of ultracompact, ultrarelativistic binary systems driven by gravitational radiation reaction was\npresented. Our model here can be thought of then as a restricted case of the\nmore general interaction they considered. However, we alert that the WD\nin their study cases is a very low mass companion. The implications of this\nfeature for the minimum periods that the binary can achieve (much less than\nthree minutes in our proposal, see Table.1) cannot be overlooked. In overall, a fundamental characteristic of these interacting binaries is that after\neach mass-transfer episode the binary separation (and orbital period, consequently) is augmented significantly, largely for non-circular orbits. Then,\nafter a new adiabatic spiral-in phase driven by GR reaction the binary is\nbrought close again, and the process repeats. This feature is a very key ingredient of our scenario.\n\nThe WD atmospheric temperature after being flared should be far\nmuch higher than the one for surface thermalization (Ergma, Lundgren & Cordes 1997)\nT =\n\n\u0012\n\nL|SGR1900+14\nf ireball\n4\u03c0R2W D \u03c3SB\n\n\u00131/4\n\n= 6.8 \u00d7 107 K,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nL|SGR1900+14\nf ireball\n\nDD\nDD\n\u2261 GMNS \u1e40 TNS\n/RTNS\n\u223c 1043\u221244 erg s\u22121 , (6)\n\nis the accretion luminosity, as given above. Therefore, the star\nemits X-rays relatively hard, and just in the band width of Rossi\nXTE, BeppoSAX, CHANDRA, XMM-NEWTON, INTEGRAL,\netc. By the time its atmospheric temperature rolls down the Debye temperature \u0398D \u223c 107 K due to reemission, the sudden crust\ncrystallization increases the WD cooling rate because the surface\nspecific heat is now due to lattice vibrations instead of thermal motions (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983). Assuming \u223c 10% of the trapped\nenergy is quickly returned into space, the timescale for this transition to occur is (see Table 1 and Figure 1 of Feroci et al. 1999)\n\u03c4cryst \u223c\n\n0.1EBurst\n\u223c 100 s.\nL|SGR1900+14\nf ireball\n\n(7)\n\nThen our view predicts: the very noticeable transition of the\nexponential time constant in GRB980827 lightcurve, around \u223c 80s\nafter risetime, could be a signature of a crystallization phase transition of the WD crust. We also stress that by using Eq.(2) some\ninsight on the WD viscosity, over the event duration, could be\ninferred from a careful analysis of GRB980827 lightcurve of \u223c\n300 s. In this respect, a critical analysis of this lightcurve shows no\nevidence of a sinusoidal modulation; the signature of ocultation in\nthe binary. Hence, the line-of-sight angle must satisfy i > 45o for\nthe system orbital features.\n\n\f4\n\nMosquera Cuesta\nTable 2.

Distance separation reduction (driven by GR\nreaction effects) of a few hundred km will yield a timescale compatible with the mean one observed for rebursting in most of the\nSGRs, i. e., \u2206Trep 6 10yr. Since after mass-shedding the orbit\nwidens faster than the WD expands (i.e., WD recoils due to angular momentum conservation [gravothermal effect] and stops mass\ntransfer), the angular momentum redistribution will prevent the binary merger to occur on this timescale \u03c4GRR . Consequently we can\nexpect the system to repeat several superoutbursts before the WD\nthermal runaway final explosion or tidal disruption. We also highlight that the action of orbital gravitational stresses (powerful tides\ndriven by the NS) may drive a sort of plate tectonics on the WD\ncrust, \u00e0 la Rothschild, Marsden & Lingenfelter (2001), which can\nprovide enough energy so as to explain why SGRs glow in hard Xrays over some months before undergoing dramatic transients such\nas GRB980827 from SGR 1900+14. This prospective mechanism\nwill be tackled elsewhere.\n\n3 SGRS GWS EMISSION: A PATHWAY TO UNRAVEL\nTHEIR NATURE\nSeveral GW signals of different nature are expected to be produced\nin the context of this picture for SGRs.

A GW signal such\nas this from SGR 1900+14 during the GRB980827 energetic outburst could have been detected by interferometers such as LIGO,\nVIRGO and GEO-600 were they operatives, but may be detected\nin the future. In passing, it worths to quote that since the conditions\nfor GWs resonant excitation (Ferrari et al. 2000) of the stars' fluid\nmodes (mainly the WD, Porb \u223c 4 \u00d7 f0 ) a continuous GWs emission could also be enhanced in this extremely close binary. This\nissue will be addressed elsewhere.\n\n4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nAn observationally consistent scenario to explain the detected modulations from SGR 1900+14 is discussed in the accompanying paper by Mosquera Cuesta (2004b). In that paper is also provided a\n\nviable origin for the secular SGRs spindown, and for the up-anddown of their periods. Most of the results are collected in Table 2.\nRelated to those results, we stress that neither NS-NS nor NS-BH\nbinaries can fit the observations of SGRs (Kouveliotou 1998,1999;\nHurley 1999a,b,c; Murakami et al. 1999; Feroci et al. 1999), since,\neven for the explosive lower mass limit of Colpi, Shapiro & Teukolsky (1993), MNS 6 0.09 M \u2299 , the oscillation frequency of its\nfundamental mode goes too high (McDermott, van Horn & Hansen\n1987) due to the NS higher density, so as to explain the relative\nlower pulsation periods observed in SGRs (see Table2). Moreover,\nsince the maximum mass of a WD is limited to the Chandrasekhar\nmass: MCh = 1.44 M\u2299 , we expect not to find SGRs with pulsation\nperiods 6 2.1 s (see Table2). A prediction that agrees with current\ndata, but that is not precluded by the magnetar model.\nTo conclude, the NS low magnetization in this model places\nit under the pulsar death line in the P \u2212 \u1e56 diagram, and hence\nturns SGRs undetectable as binary radio pulsars; a point confirmed\nby Xilouris et al. (1998). This fact makes the search for an optical and/or infra-red counterpart of SGRs with GEMINI or KECK\na timely endeavour. Meanwhile, if our scenario proves correct, a\nprospective way to study these systems is through the new generation of X-rays telescopes like CHANDRA, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, etc., and GWs observatories such as LIGO, VIRGO,\nTAMA-300, GEO-600, the TIGAs Network (which may followup the burster phase) and LISA (which may follow-up the orbital\ndynamics and WD pulsations). When operatives, they will play a\ndecisive role in deciphering the SGRs nature, as perhaps, new general relativistic astrophysical laboratories where WD-NS interacts\nfarther out the weak-field regime.\nI thank Professors Jhon C.
