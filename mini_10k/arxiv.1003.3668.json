In nuclear physics, coherent control of\nnuclear excitations has been a long-time goal, as it is related to a number of promising applications\nsuch as nuclear quantum optics [1\u20137], including isomer depletion [3, 4] or the problem of gamma\nray lasers [5\u20137]. However, nuclei proved to be much more difficult to control, due to the lack\nof coherent gamma ray sources and the more complicated underlying internal nuclear structure.\nCoherent gamma-ray optics, for years limited by the low intensity of the M\u00f6ssbauer sources,\nwas rendered possible with the advent of high brightness synchrotron radiation sources. Nuclear\nforward scattering (NFS) of synchrotron radiation (SR) [8, 9] is a well-developed experimental\nsetup in which coherent control has been achieved, by exploiting the properties of delocalized\nexcitations in systems of identical particles.\nResonant scattering of SR on a nuclear ensemble, such as identical nuclei in a crystal lattice,\noccurs via an intermediate excited state which is excitonic in nature [10\u201313]. The decay of this\ncollective nuclear excited state then occurs coherently in the forward direction, giving rise to NFS,\nand in the case of nuclei in a crystal also at Bragg angles [12, 14, 15]. The correlation of nuclear\nexcitation amplitudes in the excitonic state also leads to a speed up of the coherent decay, and\nthereby to a relative suppression of incoherent decay channels [8, 15\u201317]. The coherent decay\nchannel thus becomes considerably faster than the spontaneous one (characterized by the natural\nlifetime of a single nucleus) and can be used as control mechanism of the resonant excitation in\nNFS.\nControl of the coherent decay of the nuclear exciton enabled the observation of gamma echos\nin NFS experiments originally using M\u00f6ssbauer sources [18], followed by the observation of nuclear exciton echos produced by ultrasound in forward scattering of SR [19]. Here the coherent\ndecay was manipulated via the relative phase between the electromagnetic field scattered from two\nsample foils. Alternatively, changing the hyperfine magnetic field at the nuclear sites also provides\na way to control the coherent decay. Following the experiment described in Ref. [20] on the effect\nof an abrupt reversal of the hyperfine magnetic field direction for NFS of light from a M\u00f6ssbauer\nsource, results confirming the feasibility of nuclear coherent control also in NFS of SR were presented in Ref. [21]. The decay rate of 57 Fe nuclei in a 57 FeBO3 crystal excited by 14.4 keV SR\n2\n\n\fpulses was changed by switching the direction of the crystal magnetization. The nuclear hyperfine fields were used to partially switch the coherent decay channel of the nuclear excitation off\nand subsequently on, demonstrating the possibility to store nuclear excitation energy. The partial\nsuppression and subsequent release of the coherent nuclear decay are the consequence of interference between the hyperfine transitions, bearing a close resemblance to the underlying effect\nof electromagnetic induced transparency in quantum optics [22]. While in Ref. [21] only partial\nsuppression of the coherent decay was experimentally achieved, it was pointed out that generally\ncomplete suppression should be possible if the magnetic field is switched in a direction parallel\nto the incoming SR light. However, the suppression is very sensitive to the exact timing of the\nmagnetic field rotations.\nIn this paper we investigate the effect of the switching moment (from here on denoted switching\ntime, not to be confused with the duration of the switching process) on the coherent decay intensity\nand polarization. We focus in particular on the scattered light in a sequence of switchings that\nturn the coherent decay off and on, and study the possibility to control the polarization of the\nscattered light by selecting the appropriate switching times. An extensive analysis of the time\ndependence of the individual polarization components during the magnetic switching sequence\nallows us to determine the parameters for which two time-resolved correlated coherent decay\npulses with different photon polarizations are obtained out of one incident SR pulse.\nAs it has been pointed out in Ref. [23], in conjunction with the fact that the prompt SR pulse\ntypically creates only one (and more often no) resonant excitation in the target [24], the design of\nthis sequence of magnetic switchings provides a coherent control scheme to generate keV singlephoton entanglement in a NFS setup. The excitonic state produced by the SR pulse, consisting of\none delocalized excited nucleus, can decay (apart from losses) in either of the two time-resolved\ncorrelated coherent decay pulses with different photon polarizations. The single photon corresponding to the nuclear decay entangles the two differently polarized field modes. This is singlephoton entanglement, often also called entanglement with vacuum, that does not involve entanglement of two particles, but of two spatially or temporally separated field modes. Since here the field\nmodes, and not the associated photons, play the role of the information and entanglement carriers,\ni.e., qubits (called in this case ebits), there is only one photon involved. This peculiarity in view\nof the traditional entanglement of two particles generated some debate [25\u201328].\nDue to the possible applications, and not least in view of the controversy related to singlephoton entanglement, tests to confirm the generation of keV-photon entanglement from a NFS\n3\n\n\fsetup are of great relevance. Usually, proof of entanglement is provided by the violation of a\nBell-type inequality (which in this case should be however adapted for single-particle entanglement). Alternatively, applications such as successful teleportation experiments can indicate entanglement [29]. Here we propose and discuss an experimental setup using modern x-ray optics\ndevices such as polarization-sensitive mirrors, phase shifters and x-ray beam splitters, that can\ntest the single-particle version of Bell's inequality. An experimental realization and verification\nof keV single-photon entanglement would bring quantum information in a new energy regime,\nand could open new perspectives for the creation and verification of quantum superposition in\nmicro-optomechanical systems [30, 31], or alternatively robust quantum key distribution [32] and\nquantum cryptography [33] using entangled field modes of a single x-ray photon.\n\nII.\n\nMAGNETIC SWITCHING IN NFS\n\nLet us consider SR light scattering on nuclei inside a crystal target in a magnetic field that\nprovides hyperfine splitting of the nuclear levels according to their spin. The energy of the SR\npulse is chosen such that it can resonantly drive a nuclear transition from the nuclear ground state\nto the first excited state. Because both the duration and the transit time of the SR pulse shining on\na crystal target are short compared to the excited state lifetime \u03c4 of the nuclear excited state, the\npulse creates a collective nuclear excited state which is a spatially coherent superposition of the\nvarious excited state hyperfine levels of all the nuclei in the crystal. The SR pulse is considered in\nthe following to be a delta peak.\nIn an excited state, an isolated nucleus will decay via radiative decay or by internal conversion\ndecay (IC), with the total decay width \u0393 = \u0393\u03b3 + \u0393IC . For the 14.4 keV first excited level of\n57\n\nFe, the traditional M\u00f6ssbauer excitation used in most NFS experiments, \u0393IC /\u0393\u03b3 \u2243 8, so that\n\nan isolated excited nucleus is eight times more likely to give up its energy via IC. However, for a\ncollection of nuclei, due to the formation of the exciton, the probability for radiative decay can be\ngreatly enhanced by spatial coherence [12]. The incident wave is scattered in the forward direction\n(we will assume in the following only NFS, and no Bragg scattering), and speeded-up compared\nto the incoherent decay.\nIn the presence of a strong magnetic field, the 57 Fe nuclear ground and excited state (of spins\nIg =1/2 and Ie =3/2, respectively) split into hyperfine levels, as shown schematically in Figure 1.\nDepending on the geometry of the setup (see Figure 1) and the polarization of the incident SR\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: Scattering geometry and hyperfine level scheme of the 57 Fe transition.

The new reference frame is then {x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 }.\n\nradiation, some of the six possible hyperfine transitions will be excited, with \u2206m = me \u2212mg = \u00b11\nor \u2206m = 0, where mg and me are the projection of the nuclear spin of the ground and excited\nstates, respectively, on the quantization axis. The coherent scattering implies that each nucleus\ndecays back to its original hyperfine level mg , such that the initial and the final states of the nuclei\ncoincide.\nThere are several theoretical approaches to treat the coherent nuclear excitations induced by\nSR pulses and calculate the amplitude of the scattered light. Because of the different time scales,\nthe formation of the intermediate excitonic state and its subsequent decay can be treated as two\nindependent quantum mechanical processes, or, alternatively, the whole interaction can be considered as a scattering problem [10, 11]. In the following we briefly present a simple semiclassical\napproach based on finding the solution of the scattering problem directly in time and space [34].\nThis method is chosen because it allows for the implementation of the switching in the calculation\nin a straight-forward way.\n~ t) of the radiation pulse caused by the coherent forward scattering from\nThe amplitude E(y,\n\n5\n\n\fthe 57 Fe nuclei in the sample can be calculated using the wave equation [20, 34]\nX\n~ t)\n\u2202 E(y,\n=\u2212\nKl J~l (t)\n\u2202y\nl\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n~ \u03c4) .\nd\u03c4 J~l\u2020 (\u03c4 ) * E(y,\n\n(1)\n\nHere, l is a summation index running over me and mg and the nuclear site.

As an example, the intensity of the coherently scattered SR\nradiation for the 14.413 keV M\u00f6ssbauer transition in\n\n57\n\nFe for a sample of effective thickness\n\n\u03be = \u03c3R N0 L/4=5 is presented in Figure 2. The effective thickness is determined by the radiative\nnuclear resonance cross-section \u03c3R , the number density of 57 Fe nuclei in the sample N0 and the\nsample thickness L. As expected, in Figure 2 two beat patterns can be observed: the quantum\nbeat due to the interference between the two transitions driven by the SR pulse, given by the sum\nover l in Eq. (1), and the dynamical beat due to multiple scattering terms, given by the sum over\nthe scattering orders n in Eq. (5). Note that the excitation losses via the incoherent radiative and\nIC decay channels are included in the calculation by the natural exponential decay term in the\nexpression of the nuclear currents (2).\nMagnetic switching denotes an abrupt rotation of the hyperfine magnetic field direction that\nchanges the hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian and the nuclear sublevels basis. Subsequently, a\nnew quantization axis z \u2032 and therefore new eigenvectors for the hyperfine Hamiltonian are formed.\nSince only the direction and not the magnitude of the magnetic field is changed, the magnetic\nswitching corresponds to a redistribution of the nuclear state populations between the hyperfine\nlevels. Each monochromatic transition l between the original hyperfine levels is then transformed\ninto a multiplet composed of all allowed transitions l\u2032 projected onto the new quantum axis z \u2032 . The\ntransformation of the nuclear current matrix elements J~l (t) is related to the transformation of the\nbasis of nuclear hyperfine levels |Imi with the rotation of the quantization axis. According to the\nrepresentation of finite rotations [37], the rotation D(0 \u03b2 0) (with the Euler angles \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 and\n\u03b3 = 0) of the quantization axis transforms the spin eigenvectors via the rotation matrix elements\ndImm\u2032 (\u03b2) = hI m|D(0 \u03b2 0)|I m\u2032 i,\n|I m\u2032 i =\n\nX\n\ndImm\u2032 (\u03b2)|I mi .\n\nm\n\n7\n\n(6)\n\n\f2\n\nI (arb. units)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\nt1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nt (ns)\nFIG. 2: Calculated temporal evolution for the coherent nuclear decay: unperturbed (red line) and suppressed\n(dashed green line) by a rotation of the hyperfine magnetic field to a direction perpendicular to the sample\nat time t1 =8 ns. The switching time corresponds to the first minimum of the quantum beat.\n\nHere I is the nuclear spin and m and m\u2032 its projections on the old and new quantization axes z and\nz \u2032 , respectively, and \u03b2 the magnetic field rotation angle. If the magnetic switching has occurred at\nt = t0 , the nuclear current after the switching can be written as [21, 36]:\nJ~l\u2032 (t) = e\u2212i\u03a9l\u2032 t0\n\nX\nl\n\nI\ndIme\u2032e me (\u03b2)dmg\u2032g mg (\u03b2)J~l (t \u2212 t0 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe rotation matrix elements dIme\u2032e me (\u03b2) with me , m\u2032e \u2208 {\u22123/2, \u22121/2, 1/2, 3/2} form a 4 \u00d7 4\nI\n\ndimensional set, while the corresponding set of dmg\u2032g mg (\u03b2) with mg , m\u2032g \u2208 {\u22121/2, 1/2} has dimension 2 \u00d7 2. Thus, each new nuclear current is a linear combination of all six old currents, with\ncoefficients given by the rotation matrix elements for the ground and excited-state hyperfine levels\nI\n\ndIme\u2032e me (\u03b2)dmg\u2032g mg (\u03b2). Consequently, the vectorial orientation of the nuclear currents and thus the\npolarization of the scattered light change under the magnetic field rotation. Furthermore, the new\ncurrents J~l\u2032 (t) corresponding to each original excitation transition can interfere, and depending on\nthe switching time t and the switching angle \u03b2, their interference can be constructive or destructive. Suppression or restoration, i.e., control of the coherent nuclear decay, can thus be achieved\nby optimizing the time and angle of switching.\nExperimentally, prompt magnetic switching is possible in crystals that allow for fast rotations\n8\n\n\fof the strong crystal magnetization via weak external magnetic fields. The switching experiment in\nRef. [21] was facilitated by 57 FeBO3 , a canted antiferromagnet with a plane of easy magnetization\nparallel to the (111) surfaces. Initially, a constant weak magnetic field induces a magnetization\n~ at the nuclei. The\nparallel to the crystal plane surface and aligns the magnetic hyperfine field B\nmagnetic switching is then achieved by a stronger, pulsed magnetic field in a crystal plane perpendicular to the original magnetic field direction, that rotates the magnetization by an angle \u03b2 and\nrealigns the hyperfine magnetic field. Because of the perfection of the crystal, the desired rotation\nof the magnetization occurs abruptly, over less than 5 ns [38].\nA rotation of the magnetic field in the sample plane with an angle \u03b2 ranging up to 72\u25e6 has been\ninvestigated in the experiment described in Ref. [21]. By changing the direction of the hyperfine\nmagnetic field at a minimum of the unperturbed quantum beat pattern, partial suppression of the\ncoherent decay channel was achieved, whereas by switching at a maximum the polarization of\nthe scattered light is changed. In this case, the original \u2206m = 0 frequency components were\ntransformed to \u2206m = \u00b11 components after the switching.\nIn the following, we analyze the dependence of the switching as a function of the switching time\nand angle considering the first order scattering. The first scattering term n = 1 in the expansion\nEq. (5) corresponds to the thin crystal limit and gives the largest contribution to the scattered light\nfor our parameters. The incident radiation pulse excites the monochromatic nuclear transitions l.\nThe scattered electric field obtained from the wave equation (1) can then be written as\n~ 1 (y, t) = \u2212yE\nE\n\nX\nl\n\n~ l (~k) e\u2212i\u03a9l t\u2212\u03930 t/(2~) ,\nA\n\n(8)\n\n~ l (~k) = ~jl (~k)Kl [~j \u2020 (~k)*~e0 ]. Each component l corresponds\nwith the time-independent amplitudes A\nl\nto a certain polarization of the scattered light. After switching at time t1 with a rotation of the\nhyperfine magnetic field in the crystal plane by the angle \u03b2, the amplitudes are build up via the\ninterference of the initially excited transitions l [21],\n~ l\u2032 (~k) = ~jl\u2032 (~k)Kl\u2032\nA\n\nX\nl\n\nI\ndmg\u2032g mg (\u03b2)dIme\u2032e me (\u03b2) [~jl\u2020(~k) * ~e0 ] e\u2212i\u03a9l t1 .\n\n(9)\n\nAs it can be seen in the above equation, the amplitudes (although otherwise time-independent)\nare dependent on the moment when the switching of the quantization axis took place, given by\n~ l (~k)\nt1 . If one can find the specific switching angle \u03b2 and time t1 for which all six amplitudes A\n(corresponding to \u2206m = 0 and \u2206m = \u00b11) are zero, the first order scattering after the switching,\n~ l\u2032 (~k), is completely suppressed. Such a complete\ngiven by the field in Eq. (8) with amplitudes A\n9\n\n\f~ l\u2032 (~k), cannot be achieved by rotating the magsuppression, i.e., simultaneous cancellation of all A\nnetic field in the sample plane, irrespective of the switching time and rotation angle. The reason\n~ l\u2032 (~k) zero. It can howis that one cannot find a single switching time that yields all amplitudes A\never occur when switching the magnetic field direction parallel to the incoming photon ~k [21],\nequivalent to the hyperfine basis transformation described by the rotation matrix\nhIm\u2032 |D(\u2212\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c0/2 0)|Imi = e\u2212im\u03c0/2 dIm\u2032 m (\u2212\u03c0/2) .\n\n(10)\n\nThis switching is advantageous since the new direction of the quantization axis is parallel to the\nlight propagation direction and the \u2206m\u2032 = 0 transitions ( which correspond to light polarization\nparallel to the quantization axis) are therefore not allowed.

This corresponds to\nswitching at the minima of the unperturbed quantum beat pattern, as shown by the dashed green\nline in Figure 2, calculated with a suppressing switching at t1 = \u03c0/(2\u03a90 ) and a sample of effective\nthickness \u03be = 5. Since all the new transition amplitudes are zero, a significant suppression of the\ncoherent decay channel is achieved, so that excitation energy is stored inside the crystal. The\nintensity is not exactly zero due to the small non-zero contributions of the higher scattering order\nterms in Eq. (5). In principle, the same procedure can be applied to find the proper switching time\n~ 2 in Eq. (5)), third order scattering,\nwhich suppresses completely the second order scattering (i.e., E\netc. However, the optimal switching times differ from one scattering order to another, so that only\none scattering order can be suppressed at a time. In the following we restrict our treatment to\nsuppression of the dominant first order scattering.\nThe various frequency components can be recovered by switching back the magnetic field to\nthe initial direction parallel to the original z axis at a proper instant in time t2 . The new amplitudes\nafter this second switching depend on the two switching times t1 and t2 .

Choosing the\nswitching time t2 = 46 ns (when the amplitudes of the \u2206m = 0 components are zero) sets free\nonly the \u2206m = \u00b11 frequency components, whereas the ones with \u2206m = 0 are still suppressed.\n~ l\u2032\u2032 (~k) of the \u2206m = \u00b11 transitions\nAlternatively, for t2 = 94 ns, for which the four amplitudes A\nare zero, only the \u2206m = 0 component is released. Thus, the polarization of the emitted light in\nthe coherent decay can be controlled by choosing the proper switching time.\nThe choice of the switching times is particularly sensitive when a complicated switching sequence with more than one complete suppression of the coherent decay is envisaged. This is\n\n11\n\n\frelated to the fact that the field amplitudes recall all the switching history, since all previous\nswitching times enter their expressions. A direct consequence is that the more switchings already\noccurred, the more limited is the choice of following switching times for which a clear suppression\nof one or all polarization components can be achieved. For instance, originally complete suppression of all polarization components is guaranteed at all switching times t1 = (n \u2212 1/2)\u03c0/\u03a90 .\nHowever, after having switched at t1 = \u03c0/(2\u03a90 ) = 8 ns and t2 = 46 ns, there is only one reasonable time instance t3 in the first 300 ns after the SR pulse, at approx. t3 =99 ns, when by rotating\nthe magnetic field to a direction perpendicular to the sample, complete suppression is achieved.\nA 4-switching scheme that controls the polarization of the scattered light as proposed in\nRef. [23] requires in this respect a unique choice of switching parameters. By starting with the suppressing switching at the earliest time possible (the first minimum of the quantum beat), t1 =8 ns,\na second switching at t2 = 46 ns bringing the magnetic field back to its original direction parallel\nto the crystal sample restores only the coherent decay of the \u2206m = \u00b11 components, as described\nin the example above. Assuming the incident SR pulse to be \u03c3-polarized (in NFS, the \u03c3 and \u03c0\npolarizations are defined only by convention, with the standard notation according to which a \u03c3\npolarized photon has the electric field vector in the horizontal plane), after the second switching\nonly \u03c0-polarized photons are emitted. A third rotation of the magnetic field to the direction of\nthe incident radiation at t3 = 99 ns suppresses again almost completely the coherent decay. The\nswitching time t3 is chosen such that after the switching, all new currents interfere again destructively. The choice of the fourth switching time t4 , after which the stored excitation is released\nby a rotation of the magnetic field back to its original direction along the z axis, determines the\npolarization of the emitted light. There are only two favorable times t4 in the first 300 ns after the\nexcitation that release light with a single polarization component.\nFor t4 = 190 ns, all the \u2206m = 0 amplitudes destructively interfere and a second \u03c0-polarized\npulse is emitted, as shown in Figure 4. For comparison, we also present the unperturbed intensity without any switching. Both spectra are calculated for an effective sample thickness of\n\u03be=5. Alternatively, following the same first three switchings at t1 , t2 and t3 , a fourth switching at\nt4 = 137 ns ensures that all the \u2206m = \u00b11 amplitudes cancel and the emitted light is \u03c3-polarized.\nThis sequence of four rotations of the hyperfine magnetic field is therefore designed to control the\ncoherent decay and generate two correlated coherent decay pulses with different photon polarizations out of one SR nuclear excitation, as first presented in Ref. [23, 39]. Two pulses of similar\nintensities, the first one \u03c0- and the second one \u03c3-polarized, are emitted after t2 and t4 , respectively,\n12\n\n\f60\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\nt3\n\nt4\n\nI (arb. units)\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n10\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nt (ns)\nFIG. 4: Splitting of a single nuclear SR excitation into three temporally separated pulses achieved by the\nmagnetic switching scheme described in the text with t4 = 190 ns.

For comparison, the unperturbed intensity without any switching is shown\nby the green dotted line. The results are calculated for an effective sample thickness of \u03be=5.\n\nas shown in Figure 5. As it was argued in Ref. [23], apart from the unavoidable coherent decay\nbefore the first switching for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 t1 , the two \u03c3 and \u03c0 pulses are two entangled modes of a\nsingle photon originating from the decay of the nuclear exciton.\n\nIII.\n\nKEV SINGLE-PHOTON ENTANGLEMENT TESTS\n\nDue to the very narrow nuclear excited state width and low number of photons per mode provided by the SR source, typically one pulse creates only one or no nuclear resonant excitation in\nthe target. Effectively, the SR thus can be compared to a weak coherent driving field in atomic\nquantum optics. Focussing on the single-excitation part, the nuclear exciton can be envisaged as\nthe entanglement of N nuclei by a single non-localized excitation. This single excitation will decay coherently in the forward direction or incoherently via IC or an isotropically emitted photon.\nIn the case of coherent decay, the described sequence of magnetic switchings provides a splitting\nof the scattering response in three temporally separated peaks in the time intervals 0 \u2264 t \u2264 t1 ,\n13\n\n\f60\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\nt3\n\nt4\n\nI (arb. units)\n\n50\n40\n30\n\n\u03c0\n\n20\n\n\u03c3\n\n10\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nt (ns)\nFIG. 5: Same as Figure 4 but with t4 = 137 ns. Here the coherent scattering before the first switching and\nthe second pulse are \u03c3-polarized (red solid line), while the first pulse after t2 is \u03c0-polarized (black dashed\nline). Since typically the SR pulse creates only a single excitation in the nuclear sample, after a background\nemitted at times t \u2264 t1 , the two pulses of \u03c0 and \u03c3 polarization play the role of two entangled modes of the\nfield in single-photon entanglement. Due to the switchings, the time interval in which the coherent decay is\nexpected is substantially shorter than the nuclear lifetime \u03c4 =141 ns.\n\nt2 \u2264 t \u2264 t3 and t \u2265 t4 , as shown in Figure 5. Taking into consideration only coherent decay of\nthe single excitation at times t \u2265 t1 , the photon is either emitted with \u03c0 polarization around time\nt2 , or with \u03c3 polarization around time t4 , generating a single-photon entangled state\n|\u03a8i = \u03b1|1i\u03c3 |0i\u03c0 + \u03b2|0i\u03c3 |1i\u03c0 .\n\n(12)\n\nSingle-particle entanglement has been discussed in 1991 by Tan et al. [40], who proposed that\nit would be possible to show a contradiction between local realism and quantum mechanics using\nonly a single particle. The argument started a large debate in the community on whether this is entanglement at all [25\u201328], how one could measure particle-like or wave-like properties of the single\nparticle at two different locations, and the need of a reference oscillator to probe single-particle\nentanglement [41]. One reason for this discussion is that entanglement is commonly associated\nwith the presence of two or more particles, whereas in single-photon entanglement the role of\nthe particles is taken over by (potentially empty) field modes. In a certain sense, single-particle\n14\n\n\fentanglement is related to regarding the nuclear exciton as an entangled state, with one excitation\nequally distributed over N nuclei. The difference when comparing to one photon equally distributed over N field modes, however, is that the non-excited nuclei are still real particles, whereas\nthe non-occupied field mode is part of the empty vacuum.\nMeanwhile, single-photon entanglement is recognized as the entanglement of (two) distinguishable field modes via a single photon. The two field modes typically are either spatially\nor temporally separated. The simplest example of single-photon entanglement is a single photon\nimpinging on a beam splitter whose outputs are two spatially separated modes A and B. The\nemerging photon is then described exactly by the state given in Eq. (12), with A and B replacing\n\u03c3 and \u03c0. Using spatially separated entangled field modes, successful high-fidelity teleportation\nexperiments have been performed [42, 43], and homodyne tomography was used to check the\nnonlocality of two optical modes entangled by a single photon [44]. Similarly, temporally separated field modes entangled by the presence or absence of a single photon have been demonstrated\nexperimentally [45], and time-domain balanced homodyne detection was performed on two wellseparated temporal modes sharing a single photon [46].\nIn the case of the described NFS setup, the two field modes are distinguishable due to their\ntime structure and also to their different polarizations. The different polarization of the two pulses\ncan be used to obtain spatial separation of the entangled field modes and also the separation of the\ntwo pulses from the SR background [23]. The proposed setup makes use of state-of-the-art x-ray\npolarizers and piezoelectric fast steering mirrors. The x-ray polarizer to separate the \u03c0-polarized\nphoton from the forward scattering setup can be provided by the Si(8 4 0) Bragg reflection with\n\u0398B = 45.10\u25e6 which corresponds to the x-ray energy of the 57 Fe first excited state. At this angle,\nthe ratio of the integrated \u03c0 reflectivity to the integrated \u03c3 reflectivity for a channel-cut crystal is\n108 [47]. For the separation of the entangled \u03c3 photon from the background (also \u03c3-polarized), a\npiezoelectric fast steering mirror using Bragg reflections designed for specific reflection energies\ncan be used. The temporal separation of the background (emitted at or shortly after t = 0) and\nthe final \u03c3 photon emitted after t4 =137 ns can be exploited. A piezoelectric fast steering device\ncan move or rotate during this time a silicon, sapphire or diamond [48] x-ray mirror for the 14.413\nkeV resonant energy of 57 Fe in and out of the reflecting position. In contrast to typical choppers,\nsuch piezoelectric switching devices, either mechanical or based on the lattice deformation of the\nmirror, have the additional advantage of versatile synchronization with the incident SR.\nA similar splitting of a single photon from the SR pulse via the excitonic state into two polar15\n\n\fization modes could also be achieved otherwise, e.g., via scattering in the Faraday geometry [9],\nfor which both \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 and the \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 scattering channels are open. Such a setup is reminiscent\nof the standard implementation in the optical frequency regime where beam splitters are used in a\nsimilar fashion to generate the single photon entanglement. Alternatively, x-ray beam splitters can\nbe used exactly as in the optical case. The disadvantage of such setups for entanglement generation comes from the fact that the photon is emitted in a rather long wave packet that has a duration\non the order of the nuclear decay time \u03c4 . Furthermore, in the Faraday geometry, the polarization\nrotation gives rise to a complicated temporal structure of the two polarization components. In\ncontrast, the proposed coherent switching scheme emits the photon in a pulse which is not limited\nby the nuclear decay time, but mainly by the switching time for the magnetic field in the crystal.\nThe photon is emitted immediately after the switchings, in time windows which are substantially\nshorter than the nuclear decay time. This is a crucial advantage for possible applications, for which\nit is desirable to have short pulses emitted at known or even controllable instances in time. This\nfacilitates high repetition rates, and easier synchronization of different information carriers. Short\npulses at known times are also important, as applications or even the verification of entanglement\nare typically based on coincidence or correlation measurements which are difficult if the emission\ntime is unknown.\nWe now turn to the question how single-photon entanglement can be verified, and how such a\ntest can be implemented for the proposed NFS setup. An experimental test of nonlocality usually\nconsists in performing correlation measurements on the separated field modes sharing the single\nphoton, followed by a subsequent check if their mutual correlations violate a Bell-type inequality.\nA possibility to verify entanglement is offered by a single-particle version of Bell's inequality applied to an interference pattern produced by single particles [29]. This is a straightforward method\nto verify single-photon mode entanglement that involves the non-local behaviour in interference\nmeasurements with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A possible adaptation to our NFS setup is\nshown in Figure 6. Essentially, the coherently controlled forward scattering together with the\npolarization-sensitive mirror P form a beam splitter which separates a single excitation into two\nentangled modes. A \u03c0-polarized photon emitted at t = t2 will be reflected by the polarizer P, while\na \u03c3-polarized photon emitted shortly after t = t4 will be transmitted. The two modes should be\nrecombined on a second beam splitter BS, forming a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Depending\non the chosen reflections in the setup, the interferometer does not necessarily have to be a rectangular one, as it was pictured in the schematic plot in Figure 6. Following the recombination of\n16\n\n\fFIG. 6: Entanglement detection via the violation of a Bell inequality as proposed in Ref. [29]. After the\ntarget crystal S, a polarization-sensitive mirror P is used to separate the two entangled field modes. The two\nmodes are sent through variable delay lines acting as phase shifters. Finally, the two modes are recombined\non a beam splitter BS. Photon counters D register the signal at both output ports of the beam splitter.\n\nthe two field modes, photon counters D measure the signal from both output ports of the second\nbeam splitter. Since the photon is emitted in one of the two modes at different times (either shortly\nafter t = t2 or shortly after t = t4 ), phase shifters have to be implemented in the two arms of\nthe interferometer. Also, in the presented setup, the initial background pulse for t < t1 is not\nspatially separated from the signal, but rather has to be removed by time gating the detectors as in\nconventional NFS setups.\nIn Figure 6, we chose variable delay lines as the ones under development at DESY [49], that\ncould also be used to control the temporal separation of the two signal photon components for\nother entanglement applications. Alternatively, the delay lines can be replaced by phase shifters,\ne.g., made from silicon. In order to verify a Bell inequality violation, the photon count rates at the\ntwo output ports have to be recorded for different values of the phase shifters, and compared to\ncontradictory theoretical predictions based on quantum mechanical calculations and on \"classical\"\ncalculations [29].\nFrom a technical point of view, it should be noted that different types of interferometers have\nalready been suggested and realized in the relevant photon energy regime, see, e.g. [50]. A MachZehnder-type experiment operating at wavelength 0.663 \u00c5 with crystal blocks forming the interferometer and Si wedges as phase shifters was performed at SPring-8 [51]. Laue and Bragg crystal\nreflections have been used for x-ray Michelson interferometer setups [52\u201354]. Thus, a verification\nof nonlocality in our NFS single-photon entanglement should be possible with present x-ray optics\ndevices and SR sources.\n17\n\n\fFinally, one should mention that also other tests to verify single-photon entanglement have\nbeen performed in optical setups using a variety of Bell inequalities.\n\nIn Ref. [55], it has\n\nbeen shown that the N00N states (maximally path-entangled number states of the form |\u03a8i \u223c\n(|Nia |0ib + ei\u03c6 |0ia |Nib )) with any finite number of photons N, including N = 1, violate a\n\nClauser-Horne Bell inequality. Also, the Banaszek-Bell inequality applies to both two-particle\nand two-mode entangled systems, including spatially and temporally delocalized single photons\n[46] and achieves higher levels of violation compared to all Bell-type inequalities theoretically\nproposed for continuous variables. In Refs. [44, 56], the experimental data on a single photon delocalized over two spatially separated optical modes is shown by means of homodyne tomography\nto violate a Bell inequality with a detection loophole which is however typical for experiments\ninvolving photon counting.\nWhat is characteristic for these experimental proofs of violation of Bell-type inequalities in the\noptical regime is the use of a local oscillator, a reference oscillator which is necessary to perform\nmeasurements of wave-like properties of the single photon. The need of such a local oscillator\nwas one of the arguments originally used against single-particle entanglement, as the notion of\nsingle particle nonlocality was put in doubt [41]. In contrast to the optical frequency region, in the\ncase of the NFS setup the phase of the SR photons is unknown, and the possibility of employing\na local oscillator is therefore questionable due to technical reasons. The proposed Mach-Zender\ninterferometry experiment does not require such a local oscillator and is therefore the appropriate\nchoice for the verification of single-photon entanglement in our NFS setup.\nOnce verified, one potential application of single-photon entanglement in the x-ray energy\nregime is the creation and verification of a quantum superposition in an optomechanical system [30, 31]. In such setups, one of the stationary mirrors of a cavity is replaced by a movable\nmirror, and the radiation pressure of the light circulating in the cavity can lead to entanglement\nbetween light and mechanical motion, or to the creation of a superposition of two macroscopic\nmechanical mirror states. The experimental realization of such a macroscopic quantum superposition is severely technically demanding, and keV photons could be of advantage due to their large\nenergy and momentum compared to optical photons.\nAlso, recently the advantages of single-photon entanglement compared to traditional polarization or phase encoding for quantum key distribution have been discussed [32]. Single-photon\nentanglement requires on average less than one photon for each qubit and allows thus for low\nenergy-expense encoding of quantum information. The practical disadvantage of quantum key\n18\n\n\fdistribution schemes involving single-photon entanglement is that photon losses (which are inevitable) lead not just to reduced key rates but also to errors caused by misidentification of the\nvacuum state due to experimental accuracy. The high energy and especially the high directionality\nof the photons emitted in NFS could be of advantage in this respect.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe coherent decay of the nuclear exciton in NFS can be controlled by switching the direction of the hyperfine magnetic field at the nuclei. The theoretical formalism used to describe the\ncoherent scattering in NFS is transparent and allows the identification of the switching times and\nangles which lead to complete suppression and restoration of the coherent decay of one or even\nall polarization components to the leading order in the scattering expansion. An extended analysis\nof the scattered field amplitudes provides the optimal magnetic field rotation and switching time\nparameters for complicated switching sequences that aim at control of the time evolution of the\nscattered light intensity and polarization properties. As an example, a sequence of four magnetic\nswitchings has been proposed that produces keV single-photon entanglement using nuclear excitation of the the traditional M\u00f6ssbauer 57 Fe 14.413 keV transition. A single-particle version of a\nBell-type inequality can be applied to an interference pattern produced by the NFS single photons.\nViolation of this inequality would establish the nonlocal nature of the single-photon entangled\nstate produced in the NFS setup. A number of applications for quantum cryptography, quantum\nkey distribution or macroscopical quantum devices could profit from single-photon entanglement\nin the x-ray energy regime.\n\nV.
