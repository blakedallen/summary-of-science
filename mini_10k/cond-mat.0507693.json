We propose a scenerio whereby the combination of Kondo and Jahn-Teller\neffects provides a consistent explanation of both transport and optical data.\n\nThe past two decades have seen an enormous effort\nexerted to understand systems with strongly correlated\nelectrons. In these materials, multiple interactions result in a litany of new behavior. Interestingly, some\nof these interactions compete such that they are rarely\nfound together, but when they do coexist, the competition often produces a rich phase diagram. For example\nin the manganites competition between Jahn-Teller and\ndouble exchange interactions leads to the phenomenon\nof colossal magneto-resistance.[1] Kondo lattices are another example of materials where a variety of ground\nstates are exhibited, including Fermi liquids with heavy\nquasi-particles and Kondo-insulators.[2, 3, 4] Yet there\nare few materials where ferromagnetism and a Kondoresonance can be found simultaneously,[5] and none have\nbeen shown to exist in the underscreened limit (namely\nthe local moment is larger than the number of screening\nchannels) or to exhibit Jahn-Teller and Kondo effects.\nFurthermore, despite the large body of work on Kondo\nlattices, very few d-electron systems have been discovered\nthat manifest heavy-fermion behavior.[6]\nIn this letter, we demonstrate that Yb14 MnSb11 is\nthe first underscreened, ferromagnetic, d-electron heavy\nfermion compound as well as the first to display Kondo\nand Jahn-Teller effects. The compound Yb14 MnSb11 belongs to the \"14-1-11\" class of materials, which possess\nthe chemical formula A14 MnPn11 , where A is an alkaline\nor rare earth atom and Pn is a Pnictogen.[7, 8, 9] These\ncompounds exhibit a wide range of behavior, including\nferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism, Jahn-Teller effect,\nand colossal magneto-resistance, and can be found in\nboth metallic and semiconducting phases. Of particular\ninterest in 14-1-11 compounds are the MnPn4 tetrahedra,\nwhich are distorted due to the Jahn-Teller effect.[9] The\nmagnetic behavior of these materials generally reveals the\nMn in a d4 3+ state, consistent with what is expected\nfrom charge-balance. However, recent LDA calculations\nand X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) work\nsuggests the Mn are in a d5 + hole configuration.[10, 11]\nThe XMCD work on Yb14 MnSb11 also showed that in\nthis ferromagnet (TC = 53 K), the Yb has a f14 valence\nand thus the moment results from the MnSb4 tetrahedra.\nThe Yb14 MnSb11 single crystals were grown at ORNL\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) R(\u03c9) of Yb14 MnSb11 at six temperatures. Inset: \u03c9p (T )(f\n\u03c9p (T )) as described in the text.\n\nas described elsewhere.[8] This compound has been well\ncharacterized by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7),[9] electrical resistivity (\u03c1(T )), specific-heat [8]\nand XMCD[10]. The sample was prepared for optical\nmeasurements by mechanical polishing, resulting in a\nmirror like surface. Resistivity, specific heat, magnetic\nsusceptibility, ellipsometry and near-normal incidence reflectivity (R(\u03c9)) experiments on the same single crystal\nwere made at UCSD. The reflectivity was measured over\nbroad frequency (25 to 25,000 cm\u22121 ) and temperature\n(7 K to 292 K) ranges. The complex optical conductivity (\u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c31 (\u03c9) + i\u03c32 (\u03c9)) was determined through a\nKramers-Kronig analysis from the reflectivity measurements and confirmed at room temperature by spectroscopic ellipsometry (5,000 to 25,000 cm\u22121 ). For the low\n\u03c9 region, we employed the Hagen-Rubens formula.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot R(\u03c9) from 292 K to 7 K. We first\nfocus on the gross features seen in the 292 K spectrum,\nbegining with the gradual decrease towards a local minimum at \u03c9 \u2248 3100 cm\u22121 . This response is characteristic\nof intra-band transitions, with the minimum signifying\n\u03c9\nthe screened plasma frequency (f\n\u03c9p = \u221a\u01ebp\u221e ), where \u03c9p\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: Parameters determined through the combination\nof sum rules for the optical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and specific heat as described in the text.

The plasma frequency (\u03c9p2 = ne\nmb ), is\na measure of the kinetic energy of the carriers as n is\nthe carrier density, mb the band mass, and e the electron\ncharge. The resonance at \u03c9 \u2248 9, 000 cm\u22121 results from\ninter-band transitions. As the temperature is reduced the\nkinetic energy of the free carriers is enhanced, signified\nby the increase in R(\u03c9 < \u03c9p ) and the blue shift of \u03c9\nfp .\nFinally, the slope of the reflectance just below \u03c9\nfp grows\ndramatically, while R(\u03c9 < 1000 cm\u22121 ) flattens.\nThese features are manifested in the Kramers-Kronig\ngenerated \u03c31 (\u03c9) shown in Fig. 2. At 292 K, \u03c31 (\u03c9) reveals\ntwo overlapping broad features extending to 4, 000 cm\u22121 .\nAs the temperature is lowered these features develop into\ntwo distinct components. In the far-infrared region, there\nis a narrow Drude-like response signifying the \"coherent\"\nbehavior of the free carriers, while a mid-infrared resonance appears resulting from the \"incoherent\" response.\nThe spectra, and their temperature dependence, bear a\nstriking resemblance to what has been observed in Kondo\nlattice compounds[3, 4]. In particular, at low temperatures (T < T \u2217 ) a Fermi liquid with heavy quasi-particles\nforms resulting in a narrow Drude-like feature at low energies and a gap-like feature in the mid-infrared. As the\ntemperature is raised above the coherence temperature\n(T > T \u2217 ), the carriers are no longer scattered with the\nsame phase at each magnetic ion. Therefore, coherence\nis lost above T \u2217 and the sample reveals broad spectral\nfeatures similar to an ordinary metal. Surprisingly, the\ncoherent state in Yb14 MnSb11 appears to develop at the\nsame temperature as the ferromangetism (i.e.: T \u2217 \u2248 TC ).\nAnother notable feature of \u03c31 (\u03c9 \u2264 4000 cm\u22121 ) in\nYb14 MnSb11 is the temperature dependence of its overall strength. To quantify the change in spectral weight\nwe explore the temperature dependence of the plasma\nfrequency determined through a number of means in the\ninset of Fig. 1. Since the reflectivity minimum and the\nmaximum of the loss function (\u2212Im[ 1\u01eb ], where \u01eb is the dielectric function) only approximate \u03c9\nfp , we have exploited\nthe well-known f-sum\nrule\nto\ndetermine\nthe plasma freR\u221e\nquency: \u03c9p2 = \u03c02 0 \u03c31 (\u03c9)d\u03c9.[16] While similar changes\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) \u03c31 (\u03c9) of Yb14 MnSb11 at all measured temperatures. The clear development of a low temperature \"coherent\" peak can be seen. Inset: (solid/dashed\n\u2217\nfrom the extended Drude analysis and the fit uslines) mm(\u03c9)\ne\ning Fermi's Golden rule and the density of states in Fig. 4b,\n(blue circle) from the specific heat analysis as described in the\ntext.\n\nin spectral weight have been seen in other carrier mediated ferromagnets, they are always observed at temperatures below the onset of ferromagnetism.[14, 15] On the\nother hand, manganites have shown similar shifts in \u03c9p\ndue to the competion between Jahn-Teller and double exchange interactions.[1] However, the increase in \u03c9p seen\nin Fig. 1 is consistent with recent Hall data where the n\nincreases as the temperature is lowered.[17] Interestingly,\nthe changes in \u03c9p subside for T \u2264 TC just as the correlated state develops. As discussed later, this results from\nan interplay between the Kondo and Jahn-Teller effects.\nThe coherent state in Yb14 MnSb11 is also revealed by\nthe quasiparticle lifetime (\u03c4 (\u03c9)) and renormalized mass\n\u2217\n( mm(\u03c9)\n) determined in the extended Drude formalism:\nB\n\u03c9p2\n\u03c32 (\u03c9)\n1\nm\u2217 (\u03c9)\n=\nmb\n4\u03c0 \u03c312 (\u03c9) + \u03c322 (\u03c9) \u03c9\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9p2\n\u03c31 (\u03c9)\n1\n=\n\u03c4 (\u03c9)\n4\u03c0 \u03c312 (\u03c9) + \u03c322 (\u03c9)\n\n(2)\n\n1\nIn Fig. 3, we plot \u03c4 (\u03c9,T\n) demonstrating the development\nof long-lived quasi-particles at low energies, probed in\neither the temperature or frequency domains. This sudden reduction in scattering has also been seen in Kondo\nlattice compounds and is generally attributed to the coherent scattering of the quasi-particles by the magnetic\nimpurities. In particular, this coherent response is believed to be a key signature of the formation of a Kondo\nresonance in the lattice.[2, 3, 4, 12] Further evidence for\na Kondo resonance in Yb14 MnSb11 is provided by m\u2217(\u03c9)\nme\n\n\f3\n\n1\nFIG. 3: (color online) (black) \u03c4 (\u03c9,T\ndata with an interpo)\nlated surface, see eq. 2, (grey) the scattering rate from the d.c.\n1\n.\nresistivity (\u03c1(T ) = \u03c92 (T1)\u03c4 (T ) ), and (blue line) fit to \u03c4 (\u03c9,7K)\np\n\nplotted in the inset of Fig. 2. As T and \u03c9 are low\u2217\nof the quasi-particles is enhanced, suggesting\nered, mm(\u03c9)\ne\na renormalzation of the states at the Fermi energy (EF ).\nTo confirm this mass enhancement, we have determined the linear term in the low temperature specific\nheat (\u03b3 \u221d n1/3 m\u2217 , notR shown) and renormalized plasma\n\u03c9\nfrequency ((\u03c9p\u2217 )2 = \u03c02 0 c \u03c31 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 \u221d mn\u2217 )[18] from which\nwe can calculate the values of n and the effective mass(see\nTable I).[4] The value of m\u2217 (\u03c9 \u2192 0) determined through\nthe combination of \u03b3 and (\u03c9p\u2217 )2 is plotted in the inset\nof Fig. 2 and has an excellent agreement with the result of the extended Drude analysis. The n determined\nthis way is not plagued by the same difficulties as measuring the Hall coefficient and suggests that optics and\nspecific heat measurements are excellent complementary\nmethods to determine the carrier density in magnetic\nmaterials. This analysis also demonstrates the validity of the extended Drude analysis since we find that\n(\u03c9p (300K)/\u03c9p\u2217(7K))2 = \u03c4 (7K)/\u03c4 (300K) = m\u2217 (0)/mB .\n1\nWe return to the low T/\u03c9 suppression of \u03c4 (\u03c9,T\n) and en\u2217\n\n(\u03c9,T )\nto better understand the coherent\nhancement of m m\ne\nstate. One can model the scattering rate in a ferromagnet\nusing Fermi's Golden Rule for spin flip scattering:\n\n1\n\u221d\n\u03c4 (\u03c9)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9/2\n\n\u2212\u03c9/2\n\n[N\u2193 (\u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9/2)N\u2191 (\u03c9 \u2032 + \u03c9/2) +\n\nN\u2193 (\u03c9 \u2032 + \u03c9/2)N\u2191 (\u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9/2)]d\u03c9 \u2032\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N (\u03c9)\u2191,\u2193 is the density of states of the spin up,\ndown channels.[20] The N (\u03c9)\u2191,\u2193 that best fit the data\n1\nplotted\nare plotted in Fig. 4b, with the resulting \u03c4 (\u03c9)\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a)\u03c31 (\u03c9, 7K) with a Drude and hybridization gap fit.[3] (b) N (\u03c9)\u2191,\u2193 that fits the measured\n1\n, as described in the text.

The renormalized mass can then\nbe determined through a Kramers-Kronig transformation\n1\n,[21] the result of which is labeled fit in the inof \u03c4 (\u03c9)\nset of Fig. 2. Each channel of N (\u03c9) contains a broad\nband (bandwidth \u2248 32, 000 cm\u22121 ) and a sharp resonance\n(width \u2248 200 cm\u22121 ). The broad band is consistent with\nthe valence bandwidth predicted by LDA calculations of\nCa14 MnBi11 ,[11] and therefore this band is attributed to\nthe valence band of Yb14 MnSb11 . The key features of\nthe resonance are its narrow width, T dependence of its\n1\namplitude (note the lack of a sudden onset of \u03c4 (\u03c9,T\n) at\nhigh T ), and its connection to the renormalization of the\nquasi-particles mass and scattering rate.\nThe features of the Kondo resonance are also reflected\nin the shape of \u03c31 (\u03c9). As discussed earlier, at (T < T \u2217 )\nthe coherent peak in \u03c31 (\u03c9) results from the renormalized\nheavy quasi-particles. We attribute the mid-infrared feature to the formation of a hybridization gap in the density of states.[2, 3, 4, 12] Specifically, it is believed that\nin Kondo lattices hybridization between the local magnetic moment and the valence(conduction) band results\nin a splitting of that band. If the band is less than half\nfilled, then heavy quasi-particles are formed producing\nthe coherent response, whereas the mid-infrared feature\nresults from transitions across the hybridization gap. To\nconfirm this assertion we have fit \u03c3(\u03c9, 7K) with a classical free carrier form (Drude) plus a calculation of the\ngap response that closely follows the BCS calculation (for\nmore details see ref. [3]). The resulting fit is shown in\nFig. 4a. Interestingly, even at room temperature there\n\n\f4\nis still some evidence of hybridization. We believe this is\ndue to the Kondo temperature (TK = 300 K> T \u2217 ) as determined from the width of the resonance and EF\u2217 . Since\n1\n\u2217\nthe \u03c9 and T dependence of \u03c31 (\u03c9, T ), \u03c4 (\u03c9,T\n) , & m (\u03c9) are\nexplained by the existence of a Kondo resonance, we conclude that Yb14 MnSb11 is a Kondo lattice compound.\nInterestingly, in Yb14 MnSb11 the Kondo physics appears to be connected to the ferromagnetism as T \u2217 \u2248 TC .\nFurther evidence for the destruction of coherence above\nTC is provided by the mean free path (l ) shown in\nFig. 4c and the d.c. scattering rate shown in Fig. 3.\nBoth establish that the sample has reached the IoffeRegel limit (l = Mn-Mn distance) at TC . We note\nthat this reflects the importance of magnetic scattering in this sample. Nonetheless the d.c. resistivity\n(\u03c1(T )) displays a crossover to Fermi liquid behavior\n(\u03c1(T ) = \u03c1o + AT 2 ) below TC . Furthermore the ratio\nof A and \u03b3 satisfy the Kadowaki-Woods relation [16],\nA\n\u22125\n\u03bc\u03a9cmK 2 /(mJ/mol)2 , which is known to hold\n\u03b3 2 \u2248 10\nfor a variety of strongly correlated Fermi liquids.[19]\nWhile the data presented above can be attributed to\nthe formation of a Kondo resonance, this seems at odds\nwith the magnetic susceptibility data where the Mn appears in a d4 configuration.[8, 9] Furthermore, X-ray data\nat room temperature suggest that the MnSb4 tetrahedra\nhave a Jahn-Teller distortion, which seems inconsistent\nwith a d5 + hole configuration.[9] These apparent inconsintencies may, however, be explained by a scenario involving the formation of a Kondo resonance between the\ncarriers (holes) and one electron of the local Mn moment.\nIn the ground-state the system gains charge-transfer energy by taking one of the electrons in the Sb valence\nband and placing it into the Mn d-level. Also, the system can gain energy by distorting the tetrahedra such\nthat the empty t2G level moves above EF (see Fig. 4d).\nAt low T , these competing interactions may be resolved\nby forming a Kondo resonance between the hole in the Sb\np-band and the fifth electron in the Mn d-level. This \"underscreened\" scenerio is possible as the Jahn-Teller effect\nbreaks the degeneracy of the Mn d electrons. Furthermore we believe the Jahn-Teller effect can exist in this\nd5 configuration since the Kondo resonance will likely\nmix states from the Sb p-band with the Mn levels.\nThe scenario described above, which extends the ideas\noriginally proposed in references 8 and 11, has a number\nof interesting consequences. First the number of holes in\nthe Sb valence band will depend on the extent to which\nJahn-Teller effect overtakes the Kondo resonance, because the Kondo resonance essentially reduces the JahnTeller effect in order to transfer the extra electron in the\nMn level. This implies that as the temperature is raised\nabove the coherence temperature some free carrier spectral weight is transfered to the interband transition (See\nFig. 2 and inset of Fig. 1). Additionally the strong\nHund's coupling between the electron in the t2G level\n\nand the local moment may explain why the coherence\ntemperature appears to be the same as the ferromagnetic\ntransition temperature.\nIn conclusion we have demonstrated Yb14 MnSb11 can\nbe classified as a Kondo lattice in the underscreened\nlimit. Furthermore we have suggested a scenario wherein\nintricate balance is struck between carrier mediated ferromagnetism, Kondo and Jahn-Teller effects, which is\nconsistent with the data presented here as well as the\napparent conflict between the Jahn-Teller distortion and\nd5 ground state inferred from the XMCD results.[10] This\nscenario is also quite novel as it provides three \"firsts\", a\nd-electron system with a Kondo-resonance and ferromagnetism, Jahn-Teller and Kondo effects, and Kondo lattice\nin the underscreened limit. However theoritical work is\nclearly needed to clarify this picture as well as experimental studies of the T dependence of the Jahn-Teller\ndistortion and Mn L3 edge to quantitatively determine\nthe evolution of the local Mn configuration.\nThis work was supported by the DOE and NSF.
