In addition to the fundamental pion excitations the theory also has topological soliton solutions, known\nas Skyrmions. These are labelled by a topological charge or generalised winding\nnumber B, which can be interpreted as the baryon number of the configuration.\nOn quantization, Skyrmions are found to describe nuclei, \u2206-resonance [2] and also\nbound states of nuclei, see [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] for the quantization of multi-Skyrmions\nand [9, 10, 11] for recent quantitative predictions of the Skyrme model. It is well\nknown that Skyrmions can be quantized as fermions [12, 13]. Therefore, when the\nSkyrme field is coupled to a fermion field, there are two different ways of describing\nfermions in the same model. The fermion field can then be thought of as light quarks\nin the presence of atomic nuclei, [14]. In the presence of a Skyrme field the energy\nspectrum of the Dirac operator shows a curious behaviour, namely, a mode crosses\nfrom the positive to the negative spectrum as the coupling constant is increased,\n[15]. In a very similar model, Kahana and Ripka calculate the baryon density in the\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: swg3@kent.ac.uk\nE-mail: S.Krusch@kent.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\fone-loop approximation [16] and the energy of the Dirac sea quarks [17]. Recently,\nthese calculations have been extended to multi-Skyrmions, [18, 19].\nStatic field configurations in the original Skyrme model in flat space are given\nby maps R3 \u2192 SU(2). By using the boundary condition for the Skyrme field to\nunify the domain of such a map with infinity we make the domain compact and\nequivalent to the 3-sphere S 3 . If we also consider that S 3 is the group manifold\nof SU(2), we can see that the field configurations are topologically equivalent to\nmaps S 3 \u2192 S 3 and, because of this, the model can be generalized to the base space\nbeing a sphere of radius L, [20, 21]. In the limit L \u2192 \u221e, the original model is\nrecovered. The advantage of working on S 3 is that the Bogomoln'yi equation can\nbe solved for B = 1, and the solution is given by the identity map [20]. This enables\nus to calculate the energy spectrum and the corresponding fermion wave functions\nexplicitly.\nIn [22] a system of light fermions, on S 3 , coupled to a spherically symmetric\nbackground Skyrme field was studied for grand spin G = 0. In this paper we consider\nthe general case where the grand spin also takes positive integer values. The Dirac\nequation on S 3 is derived in section 2 through the use of stereographic coordinates.\nIn section 2.1, the solution of the Dirac equation for G = 0 is reviewed. In section 3,\nthe correct ansatz for the spin-isospin spinor for general G is deduced using parity\narguments. We then present the general solution. Plots of energy against fermionSkyrmion coupling constant are also given. In section 3.2, we discuss the degeneracy\nof energy eigenvalues. In section 4, we address the problem of calculating the energy\nof the Dirac sea using zeta function regularization. We end with a conclusion.\n\n2\n\nThe Dirac equation on S 3\n\nFollowing [22], we now recall the Dirac equation on a 3-sphere of radius L = 1.\nConsider the stereographic projection from the north pole N to the plane through\nthe equator. Let S 3 be embedded in R4 with coordinates (x1 , x2 , x3 , w). As a result\nof projecting from N onto the equatorial R3 plane, points of S 3 can be labelled with\ncoordinates Xi . The chart is defined everywhere apart from the projection point,\nN. The coordinates Xi can be written in terms of R4 coordinates as\nxi\nXi =\n.\n(1)\n1\u2212w\nWe define R2 = X12 + X22 + X32 . Then the metric can be written as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n4\n4\n,\u2212\n,\u2212\n.\ngR\u00d7S 3 = diag 1, \u2212\n(1 + R2 )2 (1 + R2 )2 (1 + R2 )2\n\n(2)\n\nWe now choose the non-coordinate basis\n\u00ea\u03b1 = e\u03b1 \u03bc \u2202X\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nIt is convenient to choose diagonal vierbeins e\u03b1 \u03bc , such that\ne0 0 = 1,\n\nei i = \u2212\n2\n\n1 + R2\n,\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere all other components vanish. With our choice of vierbeins, we can calculate the matrix valued connection 1-form \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 . The 1-form \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 satisfies the metric\ncompatibility condition \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03c9\u03b2\u03b1 , and the torsion-free condition\nd\u03b8\u0302\u03b1 + \u03c9 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b8\u0302\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u0302\u03b1 = e\u03b1 \u03bc dX \u03bc is the dual basis of \u00ea\u03b1 . After a short calculation we find\n\u001a 2\n(X \u03b1 dX \u03b2 \u2212 X \u03b2 dX \u03b1 ) \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3,\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1+R2\n\u03c9 =\n0\notherwise.\n\n(6)\n\nThe spin connection \u03a9\u03bc can now be expressed as\n\u03a9\u03bc dX \u03bc = \u2212 2i \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nwhere \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 = 4i [\u03b3\u03b1 , \u03b3\u03b2 ] and the components\ngamma-matrices, satisfying {\u03b3\u03b1 , \u03b3\u03b2 } = 2\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 .\ntation of gamma-matrices\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0\n12 0\ni\n0\n, \u03b3 =\n\u03b3 =\n\u2212\u03c3i\n0 \u221212\n\n(7)\n\nof the commutator are the standard\nWe work with the following represen\u03c3i\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n5\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 12\n12 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nbecause we will be working with parity eigenfunctions.

We consider a\nbackground B = 1 Skyrme field coupled to the fermions. The full Lagrangian L\nis the sum of the fermion Lagrangian Lf ermion , the Skyrmion Lagrangian LSkyrmion\nand the interaction Lagrangian Lint . We consider fermions in the background of a\nstatic Skyrme field and neglect the backreaction. Therefore, we no longer discuss the\nSkyrmion Lagrangian, and the interested reader is referred to [21]. Lint is derived\nin [23], namely\nLint = \u2212g \u03c8\u0304(\u03c3 + i\u03b35 \u03c4 * \u03c0)\u03c8,\n(12)\nwhere U = \u03c3 + i\u03c4 * \u03c0 is a parametrization of the Skyrme field and g is the coupling\nconstant. \u03c8 is a spin-isospin spinor. It is convenient to split the spinor into two\n2 \u00d7 2 spin-isospin matrices \u03c81 and \u03c82 such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c81\n.\n(13)\n\u03c8=\n\u03c82\n3\n\n\fSince any complex 2\u00d72 matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of the Pauli\nmatrices and the identity, it is convenient to choose these four as a basis of SU(2).\n(i)\n(i)\nThe spin-isospin matrices can then be written as \u03c8i = a0 12 + iak \u03c3k . With this\nnotation spin operators act on \u03c8 by left multiplication, \u03c3k \u03c8i , whereas the isospin\nmatrices act on \u03c8 by right multiplication,\n\u03c4k \u03c8i = \u03c8i \u03c3kT\n= \u2212\u03c8i \u03c32 \u03c3k \u03c32 .\n\n(14)\n\nIn this paper, we only consider spherically symmetric Skyrmions. The B = 1\nSkyrmion on S 3 is spherically symmetric [20], but for B > 1 this is no longer true.\nSpherically symmetric Skyrme fields are best expressed in terms of polar coordinates,\nU = exp(if (\u03bc)e\u03bc * \u03c4 ),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere f (\u03bc) is the \"radial\" shape function and e\u03bc is the unit vector in the \u03bc direction,\nsee equation (19).

L+ , L\u2212 and L3 are the orbital angular momentum operators.

The right hand side of each equation is then computed\nand matrix components are compared.\nSubstituting (37) into (18) and using the identities (38), (39), (42)-(45) and (52)(55) we are led to two equations, one in |GMia and |GMid and one in |GMib and\n|GMic . We equate coefficients of the G-eigenstates to obtain four ODEs in G1 (u),\nG2 (u), G3 (u) and G4 (u).

Due to the symmetry\n(36) states with parity (\u22121)G+1 are obtained by replacing g by \u2212g in the equations\nabove.\n\n3.1\n\nThe energy spectrum\n\nIn this section, we derive the energy spectrum of the time-independent Dirac equation (18) and the corresponding eigenfunctions. We discuss a useful symmetry of\nour system of equations (56)-(59) and also comment on associated second order\nand fourth order equations. In order to derive the spectrum, we use the theory of\nFuchsian differential equations, and in particular, regular singular points and their\nexponents, see [25]. Finally, we present the explicit solution.\nUnder the transformation\n(G1 (u), G2(u), G3 (u), G4(u)) 7\u2192 (\u2212G3 (\u2212u), \u2212G4 (\u2212u), \u2212G1 (\u2212u), \u2212G2 (\u2212u)) (60)\nfollowed by u 7\u2192 \u2212u, (57) is mapped into (59) and (56) into (58), and vice versa.\nHence the system of equations (56)-(59) remains invariant. Eliminating G1 (u) and\nG3 (u) from the system (56)-(59) results in a system of two second order equations,\nwhich again map into each other via the symmetry (60). These second order equations prove to be useful for deriving an ansatz for G2 (u) and G4 (u). Finally, we can\nalso derive two fourth order ODEs, by eliminating G4 (u) and G2 (u), respectively,\nagain related via (60). Hence, if we have solutions for G2 (u) we can find solutions\nfor G4 (u). We can then use our system of first order ODEs to find solutions for\nG1 (u) and G3 (u).\nIn order to solve our equations we first have to derive the energy eigenvalues.\nOur system of equations (56)-(59) has regular singular points at u = \u00b11 and an\nirregular singular point at infinity. For both regular singular points the exponents\nare\n(0, 0, \u2212G \u2212 12 , \u2212G \u2212 23 ).\n(61)\n8\n\n\fWe require our solutions to be regular over the whole 3-sphere and, in particular, at\nthe north and south poles, u = \u00b11. The solutions corresponding to the exponents\n\u2212G \u2212 12 and \u2212G \u2212 32 contain poles, so we can exclude these solutions. The fact\nthat there are two exponents taking values of zero means that corresponding to\neach regular singular point is a solution with logarithmic terms and the solution is\ntherefore singular. As a result, we can also exclude these solutions. The regular\nsolution can therefore be expanded as a power series in 1 + u around the south pole,\nand also a power series in 1 \u2212 u around the north pole. These two expansions only\nagree for certain values of the energy E. It turns out that these energy eigenvalues\ncan be calculated from the exponents at infinity of the fourth order ODE in G2 (u),\nmentioned above, which arises by eliminating G1 (u), G3 (u), and G4 (u) from our\nsystem of equations (56)-(59). This equation is of Fuchsian type and has three\nregular singular points at u = \u00b11 and infinity.\nThe solutions of Fuchsian differential equations can only have singularities at\ntheir singular points. According to our discussion above, we are interested in the\nsolutions of (18) which are non-singular. Therefore, G2 (u) has to be regular at\nu = \u00b11, and hence on the entire complex plane. So, G2 (u) is an analytic function,\nin fact an integral function, on the complex plane. As it is the solution of a Fuchsian\ndifferential equation, it can only have poles at infinity, and it follows that G2 (u) is\na polynomial.\nThe exponents corresponding to u = \u221e can be found by setting u = z1 then\nconsidering z \u2192 0. We obtain the exponents\np\n\u03c1s = 1 + G \u00b1 12 1 + 4E 2 + 4E \u2212 4g 2 ,\n(62)\np\n(63)\n\u03c1a = 1 + G \u00b1 21 1 + 4E 2 \u2212 4E + 8g \u2212 4g 2.\n\nAs argued above G2 (u) is a polynomial. Let its degree be denoted by k. Then\nthe exponents at u = \u221e can be equated with \u2212k. From the exponent \u03c1s we obtain\nthe following energy eigenvalues\np\n\u00b1\nEsym\n= \u2212 12 \u00b1 (k + G + 1)2 + g 2 for G = 1, 2, . . . , k = 0, 1, . . .\n(64)\n\u00b1\nEsym\nis a novel feature which arises for G > 0 only. Note that this energy is invariant\nunder g 7\u2192 \u2212g. From \u03c1a in (63) we obtain another family of energy eigenvalues,\nnamely,\np\n\u00b1\nEasym\n= 12 \u00b1 (k + G + 1)2 \u2212 2g + g 2 for G = 0, 1, . . . , k = 0, 1, . . . ,\n(65)\n\nwhere G and k are not both zero. This energy spectrum has already been obtained\nin [22] for the case G = 0. A slight subtlety occurs for k = 0 and G = 0. In this\ncase, only\nE0 = 23 \u2212 g\n(66)\n\nleads to a regular solution. The energy level (66) is rather special as it crosses from\nthe positive spectrum to the negative spectrum as the coupling constant g is varied,\nalso see [22] for further details.\nNow that we have derived the energy spectrum, we can solve the system (56)(59) by first considering the fourth order ODE in G2 (u). We make the ansatz that\n9\n\n\fG2 (u) is a polynomial in 1 + u and insert this into our ODE to find the polynomial\ncoefficients. The symmetry (60) and the system of second order equations for G2 (u)\nand G4 (u) leads to a related expression for G4 (u). Then the solution corresponding\n\u00b1\nto Easym\nis found to be\nG2 (u) =\n\nk\nX\n\naj (1 + u)\n\nj\n\nand G4 (u) = (\u22121)\n\nk\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\naj (1 \u2212 u)j .\n\nThe general expression for aj is\n\u0012 \u0013\n2j+1\n3\nk\n(2G+k+j+1)!(2G+1)!!

These are both Jacobi equations and have polynomial solutions which\ncan be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions (see [26]). For g = 0, our\nsolutions are the same.\n\n3.2\n\nDegeneracy of the energy spectrum\n\nIn order to discuss the degeneracy of the energy spectrum it is convenient to introduce n = k + G, where the integer n is analogous to the principal quantum number\narising in the quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom. Then the energy spectrum\nfor states of parity (\u22121)G is given by the two families\np\n\u00b1\nEsym\n(n) = \u2212 21 \u00b1 (n + 1)2 + g 2 for n = 1, 2, . . . ,\n(71)\np\n\u00b1\n1\nEasym (n) = 2 \u00b1 (n + 1)2 \u2212 2g + g 2 for n = 1, 2 . . . ,\n(72)\n\nand the special energy level (66),\n\nE0 =\n\n3\n2\n\n10\n\n\u2212 g.\n\n\fFigure 1 shows the energy spectra for different values of n. There are two different\nways of reading figure 1. The obvious interpretation is the energy spectrum of\nstates of parity (\u22121)G as a function of the coupling constant g \u2208 R. For the second\ninterpretation and in the following, we restrict our attention to g \u2265 0. Then, the\nnegative values of g corresponds to states with parity (\u22121)G+1 due to symmetry\n(36), while positive values of g again correspond to states of parity (\u22121)G . The\nlatter interpretation is very useful for discussing the degeneracy of the spectrum.\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u22121\n\ng\n\n\u22122\nE\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\u22125\n\nFigure 1: The energy E as a function of the coupling constant g for E0 (solid red\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ncurve), Easym\n(n) (dotted blue curves) and Esym\n(n) (dashed yellow curves).\nThe energy level (66) only exists for G = 0. It gives rise to a positive parity state\nwith energy 23 \u2212g and a negative parity state with energy 32 +g. Since the degeneracy\nof a state with grand spin G is 2G + 1 these two states are non-degenerate for g > 0,\nand \"parity doubling\" occurs for g = 0, [14].\n\u00b1\nFor Easym\n(n), positive and negative parity states will in general have different\nenergy eigenvalues for a given value of the coupling constant g. Recall that n = k+G,\nhence G can vary from 0 to n. Therefore, the degeneracy is\n\u00b1\nD(Easym\n(n))\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n(2G + 1) = (n + 1)2 .\n\nG=0\n\n11\n\n(73)\n\n\f\u00b1\nFor Esym\n(n), positive and negative parity states have the same energy for a given\nvalue of the coupling constant g. These states only exist for G > 0, hence G varies\nfrom 1 to n. Therefore, the degeneracy is\n\n\u00b1\nD(Esym\n(n))\n\n=2\n\nn\nX\n\n(2G + 1) = 2n(n + 2),\n\n(74)\n\nG=1\n\nand the extra factor of 2 is due to parity.\nWe now consider the case of zero coupling (g = 0) which is equivalent to massless\nfermions on S 3 . In this case there will clearly always be invariance under g \u2192 \u2212g,\nso\nDg=0 (E0 ) = 2,\n\nAt E =\n\n3\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u00b1\n(n) = 2 (n + 1)2 ,\nDg=0 Easym\n\n\u0001\n\u00b1\n(\u00f1) = 2\u00f1 (\u00f1 + 2) .

This\nenergy spectrum is rather special in that we can also calculate all the accidental\ndegeneracies for g > 0. These degeneracies all occur for rational values of g. For\nexample, the negative parity state with energy 23 + g is only degenerate with the\n+\nstates with Esym\n(n) for\ng = 41 (n \u2212 1)(n + 3)\n(80)\n\n\u2212\nand with the (\u22121)G+1 parity states with Easym\n(n) (changing g to \u2212g) for\n\ng = 14 n(n + 2).\n\n(81)\n\nThe positive parity state with energy 23 \u2212 g is always non-degenerate for g > 0.\n\u00b1\nSimilarly, (\u22121)G parity states of energy Easym\n(n) are degenerate with (\u22121)G+1 parity\n\u00b1\nstates of energy Easym (\u00f1) for\ng = 14 n(n + 2) \u2212 14 \u00f1(\u00f1 + 2),\n12\n\n(82)\n\n\f+\nwhich is positive for n > \u00f1. Finally, states with energy Easym\n(n) and states with\n+\nenergy Esym (\u00f1) are degenerate for\n2\n\ng=\n\n4(\u00f1 + 1)2 \u2212 (1 + (\u00f1 + 1)2 \u2212 (n + 1)2 )\n,\n4 (1 + (\u00f1 + 1)2 \u2212 (n + 1)2 )\n\n(83)\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nand a similar equation holds for Easym\n(n) and Esym\n(\u00f1).\n\n4\n\nThe Dirac Sea\n\nIn this section, we briefly comment on the zeta function regularization [28]. In order\nto calculate the energy of the Dirac sea,\nEDirac =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nD(N)E(N),\n\n(84)\n\nN =0\n\nwhere E(N) is the Nth negative energy eigenvalue, see e.g. [29], and D(N) is its\ndegeneracy, we define the zeta function\n\u03b6(s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nD(N)E(N)\u2212s .\n\n(85)\n\nN =0\n\nThe expression (84) is clearly divergent. However, the expression (85) is convergent\nfor large enough s. The Dirac sea energy (84) is then defined by the analytic\ncontinuation of (85) to s = \u22121. For example for g = 0 we have\nEg=0 = \u22124\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(N + 1)(N + 2)(N + 23 )\u2212s\n\nN =0\n\ns=\u22121\n\n.\n\n(86)\n\nHence, the relevant zeta function is\n\u03b6g=0 (s) = \u22124\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n((N + 32 )2 \u2212 14 )(N + 23 )\u2212s ,\n\n(87)\n\nN =0\n\nwhich can be rewritten as\n\u03b6g=0 (s) = \u22124\u03b6H (s \u2212 2, 23 ) + \u03b6H (s, 32 ),\n\n(88)\n\nwhere \u03b6H (s, a) is the Hurwitz zeta function defined as\n\u03b6H (s, a) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n + a)\u2212s .\n\n(89)\n\n17\n.\n240\n\n(90)\n\nn=0\n\nEvaluating \u03b6g=0 (s) at s = \u22121 we obtain\nEg=0 =\n13\n\n\fFor massive fermions on S 3 corresponding to the case f (\u03bc) = 0 in Section 2.1,\nthe energy is given by (22) and the degeneracy is\nD(N) = 4(N + 1)(N + 2).\n\n(91)\n\nHence the Dirac sea energy is given by\nEf (\u03bc)=0 = \u22124\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(N + 1)(N + 2)\n\nN =0\n\n\u0010\n\nN+\n\n\u0001\n3 2\n2\n\n+ g2\n\n\u0011\u2212s\n\ns=\u2212\n\n1.\n2\n\n(92)\n\nZeta functions of generalized Epstein-Hurwitz type are of the form\n\u221e\n\u0001\u2212s\n\u0001 X\n(n + a)2 + b2\nF s; a, b2 =\n.\n\n(93)\n\nn=0\n\nAsymptotic expansions for (93) are discussed in [30, 28].

We follow [28] to derive a formula for\nF (m) (s = \u2212 12 ; a, b2 ). We first perform a binomial expansion which is valid for b < a\nand rewrite (94) as a contour integral\nF (m) s; a, b2\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)k\n\nn=0 k=0\n\n\u0393(s + k) 2k\nb (n + a)\u22122s\u22122k+m ,\n\u0393(k + 1)\u0393(s)\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u0393(s + z)b2z (n + a)\u22122s\u22122z+m \u03c0\n=\ndz.\n2\u03c0i\n\u0393(z + 1)\u0393(s)\nsin(\u03c0z)\nn=0\n\n(95)\n(96)\n\nC\n\nRecall that\n\n(\u22121)k\n\u03c0\n=\n+ O(z \u2212 k) for k \u2208 Z.\nsin(\u03c0z)\nz\u2212k\n\n(97)\n\nThe contour C encloses all the non-negative poles of 1/ sin(\u03c0z) with anti-clockwise\norientation and can be split into a part\n\u2212zZ0 \u2212i\u221e\n\n,\n\n\u2212z0 +i\u221e\n\nwhere 0 < z0 < 21 , and a semi-circle at infinity. The latter does not contribute to the\nintegral.

The integral (98)\nhas poles at z \u2208 Z due to 1/ sin(\u03c0z). Only the non-negative poles contribute, because\nof the contour. The gamma function \u0393(z \u2212 12 ) has poles at z \u2212 21 = 0, \u22121, \u22122, . . .\nOnly the pole at z = 12 lies inside the contour. Finally, there is a contribution from\nthe pole of the Hurwitz zeta function at 2z \u2212 1 \u2212 m = 1. All the poles are simple\nunless the pole of \u03b6H at z = 1 + m2 is a non-negative integer.

The energy of the \"zero mode\"\nE0 = 32 \u2212 g also needs to be taken into account, and we expect a similar picture as\nin [17].\n16\n\n\fUnfortunately, this is a much more complicated situation, and zeta functions of\nthis type have not been discussed in the literature, to our knowledge. As a starting\npoint, we could again perform a binomial expansion. We can then rewrite the energy\nEf (\u03bc)=\u03bc as an infinite sum of zeta functions F (m) (\u2212 21 ; a; b2 ). Unfortunately, the last\nterm in (108) leads to b2 = \u22122g + g 2 which is negative for small g, and our formula\nno longer converges. It would be interesting to derive alternative expressions for\nthese types of zeta function.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we consider the Dirac equation for fermions on S 3 chirally coupled\nto a spherically-symmetric background Skyrmion with topological charge one. The\ntime-independent Dirac equation commutes with the grand spin and parity, and\nthese symmetries allow us to reduce the Dirac equation to a system of four linear\nODEs. Making use of the theory of Fuchsian differential equations, we derive the\ncomplete energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions which are given by\npolynomials. There is a positive parity state with energy\nE0 =\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2212g\n\n3\n2\n\n+ g.\n\nand a negative parity state with energy\nE0 =\n\nBoth states are generally non-degenerate. The energies\np\n\u00b1\nEasym\n(n) = 12 \u00b1 (n + 1)2 \u2212 2g + g 2\nand\n\n\u00b1\nEasym\n(n) =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u00b1\n\np\n(n + 1)2 + 2g + g 2\n\nall have degeneracy (n + 1)2 , and correspond to states with parity (\u22121)G and\n(\u22121)G+1 , respectively. For G = 0, these energies were found in [22]. Finally, the\nenergies\np\n\u00b1\nEsym\n(n) = \u2212 12 \u00b1 (n + 1)2 + g 2\n\nhave degeneracy 2n(n + 2). The factor of 2 arises because the energy of these states\nis independent of parity. Furthermore, these states only occur for G > 0.\nFor zero coupling (g = 0) the energy spectrum is E = \u00b1(N + 23 ) and the degeneracy was found to be\nD = 4(N + 1)(N + 2),\n(109)\n\nin agreement with [27]. We also found explicit formulae for accidental degeneracies\nwhich occur for special values of the coupling constant g.\nThe explicit formulae for the energy spectrum and its degeneracy enabled us\nto write down the zeta function related to the Dirac sea. For massive fermions on\nS 3 , we were able to derive an asymptotic formula for a zeta function of generalized\nEpstein-Hurwitz type. The more interesting case of fermions coupled to Skyrmions\non S 3 leads to an interesting novel type of zeta function. However, we were unable\nto evaluate it using our current approach. This is an interesting topic for further\nstudy.\n17\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank N S Manton for fruitful discussions.
