Exact solution of dynamical equations is obtained in framework\nof the hydrodynamic approximation and it is compared with the direct numerical simulation of the\nfull problem showing excellent agreement at realistic values of physical parameters. We analyze\nthe maximum of the current density and estimate the velocity of expansion. The results of the 1D\nanalysis provides also qualitative understanding of some properties of BEC expansion observed in\nexperiments.\nPACS numbers:\n\nMany current experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) include regime of a free expansion of the gas\nwhich initially was (magnetically or optically) trapped\nby a confining potential [1, 2]. The respective phase of\nthe BEC evolution is of practical interest since much information about coherent matter waves is experimentally\nobtained at this stage (say, by absorption imaging), and\nalso because of importance of a free BEC flow in a context of recently proposed new devices like, for example,\nan atomic laser [3]. At ultra-low temperatures, a trapped\nBEC is well described by the three-dimensional (3D)\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation which in the absence of a\ntrap potential is known as a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS)\nequation. In a number of specific cases it can be reduced\nto a quasi-one-dimensional one. More specifically, this\nhappens when one can neglect (due to some reasons) interaction between transverse modes. In the absence of\na trap the problem thus reduces to an integrable model,\n1D NLS equation, which is very well studied fundamental\nmodel of the nonlinear physics.\nThe problem of theoretical description of evolution of\nBEC confined by harmonic potential with varying parameters has been addressed in several papers [4]. In\nthe experiment [5] the realization of BEC expansion in\nquasi-1D waveguide has been reported and again excellent agreement has been found with theoretical predictions at long enough values of time of evolution. These results have been confirmed by numerical solution of corresponding dynamical equations for quasi-1D case [4, 6]. In\nthe present communication we give complete analytical\ntreatment of this problem. We consider only BECs with\npositive scattering lengths. In terms of the NLS equation,\nthe situation we are dealing with corresponds to the evolution of an initially localized pulse with the initial profile\ncorresponding to the ground state of a BEC confined in\na parabolic potential, i.e. to the defocusing NLS equation with zero boundary conditions at infinity. As it is\nknown, such problem does not have soliton solutions and\nindependently of number of particles the condensate will\nspread out and its density will tend to zero with time.\nThe formal analytical description of the respective solution at t \u2192 \u221e was obtained rather long ago [7]. However,\n\nfor practical purposes of analysis of experimental data it\nis desirable to have a description of the condensate evolution during the initial stages of time, too. It turns out\nthat such evolution also admits rather complete analytical description in a number of cases, and, in particular,\nwhen the initial density distribution is smooth enough,\nor in terms of BEC in the limit of large number of atoms\nwhich leads to the so-called Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. Then the hydrodynamic approach allows one to\ndescribe analytically evolution of the density and velocity\nfields of the condensate. The evolution of BEC at initial\nstages appears to be quite rich. For example, as it has\nbeen recently shown in [8], it may display wave breaking\nfor some specific initial distributions of the BEC density.\nIn the present report we describe the free expansion\nof a BEC initially confined in a harmonic potential. On\nthe base of the hydrodynamic approach we find the time\ndependence of the density and velocity distributions and\ncalculate such characteristics of the gas flow as the value\nand space and time coordinates of the maximum of current, velocity of the \"edge\" points of the condensate,\nas well as asymptotic density and velocity distributions.\nAlso we show that simple analytical estimates of the 1D\nproblem allow one to give qualitative understanding of\nthe phenomena observed in experiments with effectively\n2D BEC.\nLet us start with the 3D GP equation for the order\nparameter \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c8(r, t),\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n~2\n=\u2212\n\u2206\u03c8 + Vtrap (r)\u03c8 + g0 |\u03c8|2 \u03c8 ,\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we use the standard notation: g0 = 4\u03c0~2 as /m, as\nbeing the s-wave scattering length, which is considered\npositive, m being the atomic mass; Vtrap (r) is a trap\npotential. Considering the case of a pancake BEC [9],\n2 2\nwe take Vtrap = m\n2 \u03c9 x where \u03c9 is the harmonic oscillator frequency and in the transverse direction (i.e. in\nthe direction orthogonal to the x-axis) the size of the\ncondensate is supposed large enough to be considered\ninfinite in the first approximation. In longitudinal direction the size of the condensate is of order of magnitude\na = (~/m\u03c9)1/2 . It is convenient to introduce some typ-\n\n\f2\nical reference frequency \u03c90 so that the trap frequency is\nmeasured in units of \u03c90 , \u03c9 = \u03bd\u03c90 , \u03bd being the dimensionless trap frequency. To make the dynamical equation\ndimensionless, we introduce\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\u2212 12\n\u0010 \u221a\n2\n~k\u22a5\n2\nt \u03a8(x, t),\n\u03c8(r, t) = 2 2\u03c0a0 as\nexp ik\u22a5 r\u22a5 \u2212 i\n2m\n(2)\nwhere r\u22a5 = (y, z) and a20 = ~/m\u03c90 = a2 \u03bd, and make\na change of independent variables x = 2\u22121/4 a0 x\u2032 , t =\n21/2 t\u2032 /\u03c90 . This results in the canonical form of the NLS\nequation with a parabolic potential\ni\n\n\u2202\u03a8 \u2202 2 \u03a8\n1\n\u2212 2|\u03a8|2 \u03a8 = \u03bd 2 x2 \u03a8,\n+\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the primes were suppressed. The dimensionless\nBEC wave function \u03a8(x, t) is normalized according to\nZ \u221e\n4\u03c0 N as a0\n,\n(4)\n|\u03a8(x, t)|2 dx = 1/4\nS\n2\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere N is the total number of particles and S is an\neffective area of the transverse cross section of the condensate.\nA stationary solution \u03a8(x, t) = \u03a8(x) exp(\u2212i\u03bct), corresponding to the ground state of BEC, is given by \u03a8(x)\nsatisfying the equation\n2\n\n1\nd \u03a8\n+ \u03bc\u03a8 \u2212 2|\u03a8|2 \u03a8 = \u03bd 2 x2 \u03a8,\n2\ndx\n2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwith normalization\nZ\n\n\u221a\n2\u03bc/\u03bd\n\n\u221a\n\u2212 2\u03bc/\u03bd\n\n|\u03a8T F (x)|2 dx =\n\n(2\u03bc)3/2\n.\n3\u03bd\n\nThen the condition \u03bc \u226b \u03bd yields the following criterion\nN as a/S \u226b 1 of applicability of the TF approximation in\nphysical units. In what follows we deal mainly with two\nparameters \u03bd and \u03bc, which completely define the initial\ndistribution of the condensate density.\nAfter switching off the potential, the condensate\nevolves according to Eq. (3) with \u03bd = 0. If evolution\ndoes not lead to wave breaking of the pulse, then we\nstill can neglect the dispersion effects and use the hydrodynamic approximation for description of this evolution.\nAs we shall see, this is the case of initial distribution (6),\nso that the hydrodynamic approximation is valid even\nat asymptotically large values of time considered in [7].\nTherefore we pass from the NLS equation (3) to its hydrodynamic representation. We represent \u03a8(x, t) in the\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z x\np\n\u03a8(x, t) = \u03c1(x, t) exp i\n(9)\nv(x\u2032 , t)dx\u2032 ,\n\nso that substitution of (9) into (3) with \u03bd = 0 yields\n1\n2 \u03c1t\n\n+ (\u03c1v)x = 0,\n\n1\n2 vt\n\n(7)\n\nTF approximation (6) fails at the tails of the density distribution where the density decays exponentially as\u221a|x| \u2192\n\u221e instead of vanishing at finite distance |x| = 2\u03bc/\u03bd\n(called TF radius) according to Eq. (6). Since only a\nsmall part of the condensate's mass is concentrated in\nthese tails (for example, for \u03bc = 2 and \u03bd = 0.5, it is less\nthen 1.5%). Thus in the limit \u03bc \u226b \u03bd the distribution (6)\nis assumed to be a good approximation of the initial density distribution of BEC before switching off the external\npotential.\n\n+ vvx + \u03c1x = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is subject to the the initial conditions\n\u03c1(x, 0) = \u03c10 (x),\n\nsubject to the zero boundary condition at |x| \u2192 \u221e and\nhaving no other zeros. The eigenvalue \u03bc (chemical potential) is determined by the normalization (4). In dimensionless units the longitudinal size of the condensate\nis of order of magnitude \u03bc1/2 /\u03bd and if \u03bc \u226b \u03bd, the considerable part of the condensate can be described by TF\napproximation in which the term with the second space\nderivative in (5) can be neglected almost everywhere, so\nthat\n\u03c10 (x) \u2261 |\u03a8T F (x)|2 = 21 (\u03bc \u2212 12 \u03bd 2 x2 )\n\nBy equating Eqs. (4) and (7) we determine the value\nof the dimensionless chemical potential \u03bc in terms of experimentally measurable parameters\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\nN as a0\n1/4\n.\n(8)\n\u03bc = 2 3\u03c0\u03bd\nS\n\nv(x, 0) = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c10 (x) is taken to be the initial distribution (6). In\n(10) we have neglected the higher space derivatives of the\ndensity \u03c1(x, t) that correspond to the quantum-pressure\ncontribution.\nA problem similar to (10), (11) was studied in nonlinear optics long ago [10] for the opposite sign of the\n\"pressure\" \u03c1x in (10) which corresponds to evolution of\nan optical beam in a focusing Kerr medium. More complex initial conditions were considered in [11, 12], and\nin the recent paper [8] the same nonlinear geometrical\noptics method has been applied to investigation of wave\nbreaking phenomena in BEC. Here we shall apply the\nmethod of [10] to the problem of BEC expansion.\nWe look for a solution of (10), (11) in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc\n\u03bd 2 x2\n\u03c1(x, t) =\n1\u2212\n, v(x, t) = x\u03c6(t), (12)\n2f (t)\n2\u03bcf (t)2\nwhere according to (11) the functions f (t) and \u03c6(t) must\nsatisfy the initial conditions\nf (0) = 1,\n\n\u03c6(0) = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nSubstitution of (12) into (10) gives the relationship between f (t) and \u03c6(t),\n\u03c6(t) =\n\nf \u2032 (t)\n,\n2f (t)\n\n(14)\n\n\f3\nas well as the differential equation for f (t)\nf 2 f \u2032\u2032 = 2\u03bd 2 .\n\n(15)\n\nThis equation can be readily solved with the initial conditions f (0) = 1, f \u2032 (0) = 2f (0)\u03c6(0) = 0 (see (13) and\n(14)) to give\np\n4\u03bd t = 2 h f (f \u2212 1)\ni\np\n(16)\n+ ln 2f \u2212 1 + 2 f (f \u2212 1) .\n\nThis formula determines implicitly f as a function of t\nand, hence, the distribution of density \u03c1(x, t) according\nto Eq. (12). Then the function \u03c6(t) is determined by\n(14), so that distribution of velocities v(x, t) = x\u03c6(t) is\ngiven by\ns\n1\nx\u03bd\n1\u2212\nv(x, t) =\n.\n(17)\nf (t)\nf (t)\nThus, Eqs. (12), (14), and (16) give the complete analytic\nsolution of the posed problem in the TF approximation.\nOne of the effects which accompanies the expansion\nof the condensate is a non-monotonic behavior of the\ncurrent density\nJ(x, t) = \u03c1(x, t)v(x, t).\n\n(18)\n\nEquating its derivatives with respect to x and t to zero\nyields with the use of Eqs. (10), (12) and (17) its maximum value as well as corresponding values of x and t:\n(2\u03bc)3/2\n,\nJm (xm , tm ) =\n27\nr\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\u03bc\n3 + ln(2 + 3)\nxm =\n, tm =\n,\n2\u03bd 2\n4\u03bd\n\nxm \u2248 11.5\u03bcm (initial TF radius was \u2248 13.3\u03bcm) and at\nthe time tm \u2248 1.1 ms.\nIn asymptotic limit of large t, when f (t) \u226b f (0), we\nhave\nf (t) \u223c\n= 2\u03bd t,\n\n\u03c6(t) \u223c\n=\n\n1\n.\n2t\n\nHence, the solution (12) takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx2\nx\n\u03bc\n1\n\u2212\n, v(x, t) \u223c\n\u03c1(x, t) \u223c\n= .\n=\n4\u03bdt\n8\u03bct2\n2t\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nThese formulas describe a hydrodynamic flow \"by inertia\" when the density becomes so small that the \"pressure\" does not accelerate the gas anymore (factor 1/2 in\nthe second formula (22) corresponds to definition of the\n\"time\" variable in Eqs. (10)).\nFrom (22) we can easily find asymptotic distribution\nof particles on their velocities:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc\nv2\nW (v)dv =\n1\u2212\ndv,\n(23)\n2\u03bd\n2\u03bc\nwhich gives the number of atoms with velocities in the\ninterval (v, v + dv). Also, in the framework of the TF approximation Eq. (12) and with the use of (15) one obtains\nthe velocity of the condensate front\nvf (t) =\n\nr\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u00151/2\n\u03bc 1 df\n1\n.\n= 2\u03bc 1 \u2212\n2 \u03bd dt\nf\n\n(24)\n\n\u221a\nwhich at t \u2192 \u221e asymptotically goes to vf (\u221e) \u223c\n= 2\u03bc.\nThe corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n(19)\n\nwhich with the use of Eq. (8) can be expressed in terms\nof experimentally measurable parameters\nN as a0\nJm (xm , tm ) = 1.17 \u03bd\n,\nS\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\nN as a0\nxm = 2.74 \u03bd \u22122/3\n,\nS\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 + ln(2 + 3)\n\u2248 0.76 \u03bd \u22121 .\ntm =\n4\u03bd\n\n(20)\n\nThe maximum of the density flow is proportional to\nthe number of particles N , although the time coordinate of the current maximum does not depend on the\ndensity but only on the condensate aspect ratio \u03bd. Let\nus consider the typical experiments on the condensate\nwith N = 105 atoms of 87 Rb with scattering length\nas \u2248 5nm [13]. Taking the length scale of the condensate of order of a0 \u2248 1\u03bcm (what corresponds to the frequency \u03c90 \u223c 5 * 103 Hz) and transversal radius \u2248 10\u03bcm\none can obtain for \u03bd = 0.2 the maximum of the current\ndensity Jm \u2248 100 atoms*\u03bcm\u22122 *ms\u22121 in the coordinate\n\nFIG. 1: Time dependence of the front velocity vf (t) for \u03bc = 2\nand for different \u03bd (solid line \u03bd = 0.1, dotted line \u03bd = 0.2,\ndashed line \u03bd = 0.5). In the insert the corresponding initial\ndistributions of the condensate density \u03c10 (x) are depicted.\n\nTo verify above findings, we have carried out numerical simulations of the condensate dynamics governed by\nEq. (3) after switching off the trap potential, i.e. with\n\u03bd = 0. Initial profile of the condensate was taken as a\nnumerical solution of Eq. (5).\n\n\f4\n\nJ\n\nt\nx\n\nFIG. 2: Spatial-temporal behavior of the density flow J(x, t)\nfor \u03bc = 2 and \u03bd = 0.2.\n\nIn agreement with analytical predictions we found\nthat during expansion the current density J(x, t) =\n\u03c1(x, t)v(x, t) has maximum (see Fig. 2). The space and\ntime coordinates of this maximum which were calculated\nwith the use of the TF approximation and by direct numerical calculations practically coincide (see Fig. 3). The\ndiscrepancy between the analytical and numerical calculations increases with increase of the parameter \u03bd (see\nFig. 3) what can be explained by lost of the accuracy of\nthe TF approximation in accordance with the criterion\n\u03bc \u226b \u03bd.\n(b )\n\n(a)\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .3\n\n\u03bd=0.2\n\u03bd=0.2\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .2\n\nJm\n\nJm\n0 .1\n\n\u03bd=0.5\n\n0 .1\n\n\u03bd=0.5\n\nbe done by conparison of the respect kinetic parts of\nthe initial 3D GP equation. This gives us a criterium\nT0 /T\u22a5 \u2248 a2 /a2\u22a5 \u2248 0.01 \u226a 1 where T0 and T\u22a5 are characteristics times of the processes in the axial and radial\ndirection of the condensate correspondingly. Considering time scale t \u226a T\u22a5 one can neglect the kinetics of\nthe condensate in the radial direction and thus consider\nit to be unchanged in this direction. In order to estimate T0 and T\u22a5 we notice that velocity has an order of\n\u221a\na\u22a5\nmagnitude v \u223c \u03bc (see (24)) and thus T0 \u2243 \u221a\n\u03bc , a\u22a5\nbeing the transverse radius. In the case of numerical calculations reported in Figs.1,2 one estimates T0 \u223c 0.4ms\n(1 dimensional unit) and T\u22a5 \u223c 40ms (100 dimmensional\nunits) and thus the asymptotic limit described by (21) is\nindeed achieved.\nTo conclude, it is interesting to make a comparison of\nour simplified 1D model with some experiments where\nthe expansion of the condensate cloud was observed. To\nfollow the real experimental setup we take \u03bc =const what\ncorresponds to constant density \u03c10 at the condensate center (see Eq. (6)) and look for the front velocities vf (t)\nwith different \u03bd what corresponds to different sizes (number of particles N ) of the condensate in the transversal\ndirections as was shown in Fig.1. For larger values \u03bd\n(more narrow profile of the condensate) the front velocity vf is higher than for condensate with smaller \u03bd. This\nresult of the 1D model is in qualitative agreement with\nthe experimental observations where faster expansion of\nthe condensate cloud was observed in the direction with\nsmaller transverse size [1, 2].\n\nLet us estimate time when we can consider an expantion of the condensate cloud only in the axial direction.\nIn the particular case of the pancake geometry this can\n\nV.V.K. is grateful to A.
