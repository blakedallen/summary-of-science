INTRODUCTION\n\nThe survival of cosmological minihalos in the ionizing\nand Lyman-Werner (LW) UV fields of primordial stars\nis key to the rise of stellar populations at high redshifts.\nNumerical models suggest that the first stars are very\nmassive, 25 - 500 M\u2299 , and that they form in isolation in\nsmall dark matter halos of \u223c 105 - 107 M\u2299 at z \u223c 20\n- 30 (Bromm et al. 1999, 2002; Nakamura & Umemura\n2001; Abel et al. 2000, 2002; O'Shea & Norman 2007).\nThese stars create large H II regions 2.5 - 5 kpc in radius that can engulf nearby halos (Whalen et al. 2004;\nKitayama et al. 2004; Alvarez et al. 2006; Abel et al.\n2007; Wise & Abel 2008a). From z \u223c 10 - 20 Population III (Pop III) stars also build up a global LW\nbackground that sterilizes minihalos of H2 , delaying or\npreventing the formation of new stars (Haiman et al.\n1997, 2000; Machacek et al. 2001; Mesinger et al. 2006;\nWise & Abel 2007; Susa 2007; O'Shea & Norman 2008;\nWise & Abel 2007; Johnson et al. 2007; Mesinger et al.\n2009; Ahn et al. 2009). At high redshifts, ionizing radiation is relatively local while LW photons can originate\nfrom many megaparsecs away because their energies lie\nbelow the ionization limit of H.\nThe picture is simpler in the first generation, in\nwhich there is no LW background.\nSimulations\nof halo photoevaporation by nearby very massive\n(& 100 M\u2299 ) primordial stars have been performed,\nboth with (O'Shea et al. 2005; Susa & Umemura 2006;\n1 McWilliams Fellow, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. Email: dwhalen@lanl.gov\n2 Nuclear & Particle Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology\n(T-2), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545\n3 Applied Physics (X-2), Los Alamos National Laboratory\n4 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602\n\nAhn & Shapiro 2007; Whalen et al. 2008a; Wise & Abel\n2008b; Hasegawa et al. 2009; Susa et al. 2009) and without (Shapiro et al. 2004; Iliev et al. 2005) H2 gas chemistry. The two- and three-dimensional studies are in\ngood agreement with each other but not with the onedimensional studies (Ahn & Shapiro 2007), primarily\ndue to the serious hydrodynamical artifacts that arise\nfrom unphysical shock focusing and central bounce that\noccur in one-dimensional spherical coordinate meshes.\nWhen multifrequency photon transport is coupled to primordial chemistry and hydrodynamics, halo photoevaporation proceeds in two stages. First, LW photons from\nthe star reach the halo before the I-front, partly dissociating molecular hydrogen in its core and slowing or\nhalting its collapse. Not all of the H2 is erradicated because molecular hydrogen deep in the halo partly shields\nitself from the photons and small free electron fractions\nrestore H2 by catalysis through the H\u2212 channel. The\nI-front decelerates as it approaches the halo and transforms from R-type to D-type. Molecular hydrogen forms\nin the small ionized fractions and warm temperatures\nin the outer layers of the front (e.g. Ricotti et al. 2001;\nWhalen & Norman 2008a), partly shielding the interior\nof the halo from LW photons from the star and even\nallowing H2 fractions in the core to rise in some cases.\nThe ionization front preferentially advances through the\nlow densities above and below the halo and assumes a\ncometary shape, with the inner regions of the halo casting a shadow.\nSecond, after the death of the star the H II region surrounding the halo begins to recombine out\nof equilibrium, rapidly forming H2 and HD that can\ncool the ionized gas down to the CMB temperature\n(Nakamura & Umemura 2002; Johnson & Bromm 2006;\nYoshida et al. 2007; Greif et al. 2008). At the same time,\n\n\f2\nH2 reconstitutes in the core, rapidly surpassing its original levels and allowing gas to again cool and collapse.\nMeanwhile, the I-front shock remnant continues to converge on the halo core from one side while warm ionized\ngas presses down into the shadow and wraps around the\nhalo from behind. If the UV flux from the star is not too\nhigh, the relic shock compresses the core and enriches it\nwith the H2 originally formed in the I-front, accelerating its cooling and collapse into a new star. If the flux\nfrom the star is large, the ionized gas instead disrupts the\ncore and pre-empts new star formation. The studies performed to date assume stars that do not die in supernova\n(SN) explosions and therefore exclude ram pressure stripping of the halo by the remnant (Cen & Riquelme 2008;\nSakuma & Susa 2009) and its contamination and cooling\nby heavy elements. In the first generation of stars, both\nstages of halo photoevaporation occur on time scales that\nare short in comparison to merger or accretion times.\nIn large scale calculations of cosmological structure formation, halo evaporation is usually modeled with metagalactic ionizing and LW backgrounds that uniformly\npermeate the simulation volume. Such halos evolve very\ndifferently than when photon transport is performed because they are photoevaporated and photodissociated\nfrom the inside out. Rather than being compressed and\nshielded from LW photons, baryons are expelled from all\ndirections. Consequently, radiative feedback is invariably\nnegative in these models. An exception to this are the\nrecent simulations by Mesinger et al. (2009), who find\nthat low mass halos that are easily evaporated at early\ntimes later pool gas and form stars when the uniform\nfields are turned off and the fossil H II regions cool down.\nSelf-shielding of H2 from external UV sources cannot be\nmodeled by imposed backgrounds, so molecular hydrogen is driven to much lower levels in these halos than in\nreal ones. In general, negative feedback in studies that\nrely on metagalactic UV backgrounds should be taken\nas a (possibly extreme) upper limit. Star formation in\nthe UV environments of the early universe is likely to be\nsignificantly more robust.\nIn principle, the parameter space for local radiative\nfeedback between clustered minihalos is vast even if supernova effects are excluded, making the formulation of\ngeneral rules for use in analytical models problematic.\nHalo mass, central baryon density, distance and luminosity of the star, stellar lifetime and spectral profile all\ngovern halo evaporation. Distance and luminosity can be\ncombined in a single parameter over intervals in stellar\nmass for which the shape of the source spectrum does not\nvary much. Whalen et al. (2008a) further reduced this\nparameter space by examining feedback in the smallest\nhalo ever found to form a star in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculation but at four stages of collapse.\nSince more massive halos at the same central baryon density would be less affected by radiation, their findings\nconstitute a conservative upper limit to the influence one\nstar can exert on any neighbor halo capable of forming\na star.\nIn this paper we extend our previous survey by examining the evaporation of minihalos by low-mass primordial stars prior to the buildup of a large LW background.\nPop III stars from 25 - 80 M\u2299 have spectra with larger\nLW/ionizing UV ratios than those of the 120 M\u2299 star in\nour previous study and they illuminate other halos for\n\nlonger times. We sample the same halo and central gas\ndensities as in our earlier study in order to place upper\nlimits on the radiative feedback of such stars on more\nmassive halos. By determining the final state of the halo\ncore several Myr after the death of the star we construct\nrules for local radiative and kinetic feedback as a function\nof stellar mass, initial core density, and distance to the\nstar. In \u00a7 2 we review our numerical methods, in \u00a7 3 we\ndescribe our cosmological halo models, in \u00a7 4 we tabulate\nboth radiative and kinetic feedback in a photoevaporated\nhalo, and in \u00a7 5 we conclude.\n2. NUMERICAL ALGORITHM\n\nWe perform our halo photoevaporation calculations\nwith ZEUS-MP (Hayes et al. 2006), a massively-parallel\nEulerian astrophysical hydrodynamics code that solves\nthe equations of ideal fluid dynamics5 :\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1v)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1vi\n= \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1vi v) \u2212 \u2207p \u2212 \u03c1\u2207\u03a6 \u2212 \u2207* Q\n\u2202t\n\u2202e\n= \u2212\u2207 * (ev) \u2212 p\u2207 * v \u2212 Q : \u2207v.\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere, \u03c1, e, and the vi are the mass density, internal energy density, and velocity at each mesh point\nand p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)e and Q are the gas pressure and\nthe von Neumann-Richtmeyer artificial viscosity tensor\n(Stone & Norman 1992). ZEUS-MP evolves these equations with a second-order accurate monotonic advection\nscheme (van Leer 1977) in one, two, or three dimensions on Cartesian (XYZ), cylindrical (ZRP), or spherical polar (RTP) coordinate meshes. Our augmented version of the publically-available code self-consistently couples primordial gas chemistry (Whalen & Norman 2006,\n2008b) and multifrequency photon-conserving UV radiative transfer (Whalen & Norman 2008a) to fluid dynamics for radiation hydroynamical transport of cosmological\nI-fronts.\n2.1. Primordial H and He Chemistry\n\nWe evolve H, H+ , He, He+ , He2+ , H\u2212 , H+\n2 , H2 , and\ne\u2212 with nine additional continuity equations and the\nnonequilibrium rate equations of Anninos et al. (1997):\nXX\nX\n\u2202\u03c1i\n\u03baj \u03c1j , (4)\n= \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1i v) +\n\u03b2jk (T )\u03c1j \u03c1k \u2212\n\u2202t\nj\nj\nk\n\nwhere \u03b2jk is the rate coefficient of the reaction between\nspecies j and k that creates (+) or destroys (-) species\ni, and the \u03baj are the radiative rate coefficients. We assume that the species share a common velocity distribution. Mass and charge conservation, which are not\nguaranteed by either chemical or advective updates, are\nenforced each time the fluid equations are solved. The\ndivergence terms and reaction network are operator-split\nand evolved on their respective time scales, as we explain\nin greater detail below.\n5\n\nhttp://lca.ucsd.edu/portal/codes/zeusmp2\n\n\f3\nMicrophysical heating and cooling due to photoionization and gas chemistry is coupled to the gas energy density by an isochoric update that is operator-split from\nupdates to the fluid equations:\n\u0117gas = \u0393 \u2212 \u039b,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the cumulative heating rate due to photons\nof all frequencies and \u039b is the sum of the cooling rates\ndue to collisional ionization and excitation of H and He,\nrecombinations of H and He, inverse Compton scattering (IC) off the CMB, bremsstrahlung emission, and H2\ncooling (Galli & Palla 1998).\n2.2. Radiative Transfer\n\nOur photon-conserving UV transport (Abel et al.\n1999; Mellema et al. 2006), which is distinct from the\nflux-limited diffusion native to the public release of\nZEUS-MP, solves the static approximation to the equation of transfer in flux form to compute radiative rate\ncoefficients for the reaction network at every point on\nthe coordinate mesh (Abel et al. 1999). As currently implemented, our code can transport photons from a point\nsource centered in a spherical grid or in plane waves along\nthe x or z-axes of Cartesian or cylindrical meshes. In our\nmodels, the radiation from the star is treated as a plane\nwave that propagates along the positive z-axis. Plane\nwaves are a good approximation to the UV ionizing flux\nat the interhalo separations in our study, but we attenuate their intensity by 1/R2 to account for geometrical\ndilution.\nAs in Whalen et al. (2008a), we discretize the blackbody photon emission rates of the stars in our survey\nwith 40 uniform bins from 0.755 to 13.6 eV and 80 logarithmically spaced bins from 13.6 eV to 90 eV, again\nnormalizing them by the total ionizing photon rates for\nPop III stars by Schaerer (2002). The radiative reactions\nin our models are listed in Table 1 of Whalen & Norman\n(2008a). We do not evaluate H2 photodissociation rates\nwith radiative transfer. Instead, we calculate them along\nrays parallel to the direction of radiation flow using selfshielding functions modified for thermal broadening as\nprescribed by Draine & Bertoldi (1996) to approximate\nthe effects of gas motion. They are shown in equations\n9 and 10 of Whalen & Norman (2008a).\n2.3. Radiation Forces\nSince our prior survey of radiative feedback, we have\nimplemented momentum deposition in the gas due to\nionizations. Radiation pressure in ionizing UV transport\ncomes into play at two locations: at the I-front itself and\nin recombining gas in the H II region. Whalen & Norman\n(2006) examined the acceleration of fluid elements at the\nfront and found that it was large but momentary, and\nthat its inclusion alters the velocity of the front by only\n1 - 2 km s\u22121 . Direct momentum deposition within the H\nII region is only prominent where gas is very dense, like\nthe center of a cosmological minihalo being evaporated\nby a star at its center. There, rapid successive cycles of\nionization and recombination can impart radiation forces\nto the gas that are hundreds of times the strength of\ngravity at early times (lower left panel of Figure 1 in\nKitayama et al. 2004). As these forces propel gas near\nthe center of the halo out into the H II region, its densities\n\nand recombination rates fall, so more ionizing photons\nfrom the star reach the I-front. This higher flux results\nin I-fronts that are faster than when such forces are not\nincluded. Thus, in early UV breakout, radiation forces\nshould speed up the I-front, and in trial runs we find that\nD-type fronts are 10 - 20% faster than when momentum\ntransfer due ionizations is neglected. However, this effect\nis transient: after the internal rearrangement of gas deep\nwithin the H II region dilutes its interior, radiation forces\nthere sharply fall.\nWe expect much weaker forces in this study because\nthe front climbs a density gradient as it approaches the\nhalo rather than descending one, so the gas behind the\nI-front is always relatively diffuse. Since new ionizations\ndue to recombinations are far less frequent, less momentum will be imparted to the gas, so we include these\neffects only for completeness. Updates to the gas velocities are straightforward since momentum deposition due\nto direct photons from the source is always parallel to the\ndirection of radiation flow. We describe the time scales\non which momentum updates are performed below.\n2.4. Adaptive Subcycling\nA hierarchy of highly disparate characteristic time\nscales arises when gas dynamics, radiative transfer, and\nprimordial chemistry are solved in a given application.\nThe three governing times are the Courant time, the\nchemical time\nne + 0.001nH\n,\n(6)\ntchem = 0.1\n\u1e45e\n\nand the photoheating/cooling time\nthc = 0.1\n\negas\n.\n\u0117ht/cool\n\n(7)\n\nTheir relative magnitudes can seamlessly evolve throughout a single application. For example, when an I-front\npropagates through a medium, photoheating times are\noften smaller than Courant times, and chemical time\nscales are usually shorter than either one. On the other\nhand, fossil H II regions can cool faster than they recombine, so cooling times become shorter than chemical times. The key to solving all three processes selfconsistently is to evolve each on its own timescale without restricting the entire algorithm to the shortest of the\ntimes. To successfully deal with both I-fronts and relic\nH II regions, an algorithm must adaptively reshuffle the\ntime scales on which the three processes are solved. Implicit schemes are sometimes applied to stiff sets of differential equations like those in our model because they\nare unconditionally stable over the Courant time. However, accurate I-front transport in stratified media often\nrequires restricting updates to both the gas energy and\nfluid equations to photoheating times in order to capture the correct energy deposition into the gas, and linear systems solves over such short time scales would be\nprohibitive in more than one or two dimensions. Enforcing photon conservation in implicit schemes can also be\nproblematic.\nWe instead subcycle chemical species and gas energy\nupdates over the minimum of the chemical and heating/cooling times until the larger of the two has been\ncrossed, at which point we perform full hydrodynamical\n\n\f4\n104\n\n1.0\n\n103\n\n-1.0\nvelocity (km/s)\n\ndensity (cm-3)\n\n102\n\n023\n039\n059\n073\n\n0\n\n023\n039\n059\n073\n\n101\n\n1\n\n-2.0\n\n-3.0\n10-1\n\n-4.0\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n10-1\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\n102\nradius (pc)\n\n103\n\n104\n\n10-1\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\n102\nradius (pc)\n\n103\n\n104\n\nFig. 1.- Spherically-averaged baryon profiles for the 1.35 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 halo at four stages of evolution.

Our adaptive subcycling scheme is described in greater detail in\n(Whalen & Norman 2008b).\n3. HALO MODELS\n5\n\nThe 1.35 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 halos we study are computed\nfrom cosmological initial conditions in the Enzo adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code as described in detail in Whalen et al. (2008a). The halo baryon density\nand temperature profiles were spherically averaged and\nthen mapped onto a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate (ZR) grid in ZEUS-MP. The assumption of radial\nsymmetry in two dimensions is approximate but valid,\ngiven the spheroidal nature of the halos. A single, symmetrized baryon profile better represents all halos of this\nmass than the three-dimensional profile of just this halo\nbecause small differences in angular distribution of the\nbaryons are averaged out. We center the halo on the\nz\u2212axis so that only its upper hemisphere resides on the\ngrid. The mesh boundaries are -125 pc and 125 pc in\nz and 0.01 pc and 125 pc in r. The grid is 1000 zones\nin z and 500 zones in r with a spatial resolution of 0.25\npc. Outflow conditions are assigned to the upper and\nlower boundaries in z and reflecting and outflow conditions are imposed on the inner and outer boundaries in\nr, respectively.\nDark matter gravity is included by constructing a separate potential that cancels pressure forces everywhere\n\non the mesh, thus imposing hydrostatic equilibrium on\nthe halo, and then holding the potential fixed throughout the simulation. Force updates to gas velocities are\nperformed with the potential every hydrodynamical time\nstep during the simulation. Neglecting dark matter dynamics introduces no serious errors because the gas in\nthe halo evolves on much shorter time scales than either\nthe Hubble time or merger times, which at z \u223c 20 are\napproximately 20 Myr. Updates to the self-gravity of the\ngas are also performed every hydrodynamical time step\nby evolving Poisson's equation with a two-dimensional\nconjugate gradient (CG) solver.\nIn reality, the halo does have infall velocities as shown\nin Fig 1, but they are minor. Their inclusion would only\nslightly enhance core densities during photoevaporation.\nThe composition of the gas in our models was primordial,\n76% H and 24% He by mass. We assume ionized and H2\nfractions of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 , respectively. These\nvalues are consistent with remnant free electron fractions\nfrom the era of recombination at the redshift z = 20\nwe take for our models and with those expected from\ncollisional ionizations in cosmological accretion shocks.\nWe consider the four evolutionary stages of the halo in\nour earlier work, corresponding to central densities nc =\n1.43, 10.5, 108, and 1596 cm\u22123 , respectively. Each halo\nprofile is illuminated at 150, 250, 500, and 1000 pc, which\nare typical of interhalo separations in a cluster. Each\nprofile is illuminated by 25, 40, 60 and 80 M\u2299 stars for\ntheir respective lifetimes, 6.46, 3.86, 3.46 and 3.01 Myr,\nfor a total of 64 models. These stars sample the lower end\nof the Population III mass spectrum. After the death of\nthe star the halo is further evolved to a total of 10 Myr,\nor about half of a merger time, to determine the effect of\nrelic H II region dynamics on the gas in the core.\n\n\f5\n\nEB =\n\n3 GMh mb\n,\n5 Rvir\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Mh , mb , and Rvir are the total halo mass, baryon\nmass, and virial radius of the halo, respectively, then the\nescape speed vesc is\n\u00131\n\u0012\n6 GMh mb 2\nvesc \u223c\n.\n(9)\n5 Rvir\nFor the halo in our models, vesc \u223c 2.6 km s\u22121 .\n4. RESULTS\n\nThe (Whalen et al. 2008a) study found several possible final fates for halos photoevaporated by a 120 M\u2299\nstar. If the halo is very diffuse, with nc < 1 cm\u22123 , it is\ncompletely evaporated anywhere it resides in the cluster,\nwith no star formation. If the halo is more evolved, with\nnc > 1000 cm\u22123 , its core is shielded from both ionizing\nand LW flux and star formation proceeds there without\ndelay. In halos of medium central density the relic ionization front shock either compresses and enriches the core\nwith H2 , potentially hastening its cooling and collapse\ninto a star, or its residual momentum disrupts the core,\ndelaying or suppressing star formation. For comparison\nto our 25 - 80 M\u2299 models, which are evolved to 10 Myr,\nwe ran the 120 M\u2299 models of (Whalen et al. 2008a) out\nto the same time. We list final outcomes for star formation in these simulations according to the criteria set\nforth in section 3.1 in Figure 2.\n4.1. 25 - 80 M\u2299 Stars\n\nIn Figures 3 and 4 we tabulate the effects of local ionizing and LW radiation on star formation in the halo near\n25, 40, 60 and 80 M\u2299 stars. First, we note that in each of\nthese stars new star formation obeys the same trends as\nin a 120 M\u2299 star: it is first suppressed, then delayed, and\nfinally unaffected as its central baryon density and distance to the star grow. These trends are primarily due to\n\n103\n\ndistance (pc)\n\n3.1. Criteria for Star Formation\nUnlike AMR or Lagrangian SPH algorithms, the fixed\nEulerian grid in ZEUS-MP lacks the resolution to follow the collapse of the baryons in the halo into a new\nstar. However, numerical simulations demonstrate that\nprimordial star formation is a very robust process: if a\nhalo is in a state in which its baryons can form a star,\nit will within a few Myr. Since our halo is one in which\nstar formation has already been proven to occur, if the\nfinal density and H2 fraction of its core is greater than\nor equal to its pre-illumination levels, a star will form at\nits center. In some cases the relic I-front shock passes\nthrough the center of the halo and imparts an impulse to\nthe gas there. However, if the final velocity of the perturbed baryons within a parsec of the core is less than the\nescape speed from the halo, they will be trapped by the\ndark matter potential and still form a star. We therefore\nadopt the simple criteria that if central baryon densities\nand H2 fractions in the halo are the same or greater than\nthose just before illumination, and if central gas velocities are lower than the escape speed, a star will form in\nthe halo. If we approximate the binding energy EB of the\nbaryons to the halo by that of a homogeneous sphere,\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n102\nnc (cm )\n-3\n\n103\n\nFig. 2.- Star formation in a 1.35 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 halo in the vicinity of a 120 M\u2299 star, from Whalen et al. (2008a). The central\nbaryon densities nc of the halo at the time of illumination were\n1.43, 10.5, 108, and 1596 cm\u22121 , respectively. The 120 M\u2299 star\nwas at 150, 250, 500 and 1000 pc. Completely evaporated halos\nwith no star formation are labeled by crosses and halos with delayed or undisturbed star formation are represented by triangles\nand circles, respectively.\n\nthe momentum with which the I-front shock reaches the\ncore of the halo. As explained earlier, when star formation is delayed it is due either to disruption of the center\nof the halo by the relic I-front shock, LW photodissociation of the core of the halo, or both. If star formation\nis unaffected it is because the core is completely shielded\nfrom LW flux, which also guarantees that the relic I-front\nshock will not reach the core before it forms a star. From\nthe upper left to lower right in the 60 and 80 M\u2299 panels\nruns a line that marks the boundary between quenched\nstar formation and delayed or undisturbed star formation (corresponding lines for 25 and 40 M\u2299 stars, which\ndie in SN explosions whose kinetic feedback must also be\ntaken into account, are shown in section 4.2). The suppression of new star formation in the models lying just\nbelow this line is usually unambiguous: the shock completely sweeps baryons from the core of the halo. Only\nin models lying just above this line does star formation\nvary with the mass of the illuminating star. The line advances gradually up and to the right with neighbor star\nmass, but the shift is minor from 25 - 80 M\u2299 . In a halo\nat a fixed central baryon density and distance from the\nstar, the formation of a new star is at most delayed if it\nwas once unaffected, or halted if it was once delayed, as\nthe mass of the illuminating star varies from 25 - 80 M\u2299 .\nStar formation remains unchanged above and below this\nnarrow band. We note that the lines are drawn to cut\nthe space between symbols evenly and as such should be\ntaken as order of magnitude estimates.\nWhy is star formation in the satellite halo relatively\n\n\f6\n\ndistance (pc)\n\n103\n\ndistance (pc)\n\n103\n\n102\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nnc (cm-3)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\nnc (cm-3)\n\n103\n\nFig. 3.- Star formation in the halo when illuminated by a 25 M\u2299 star (left) and a 40 M\u2299 star (right) at four central baryon densities\nnc , 1.43, 10.5, 108, and 1596 cm\u22123 , and at four distances from the star, 150, 250, 500 and 1000 pc, which are typical interhalo spacings\nwithin a cluster.

Completely ionized halos with no star formation are labeled by crosses, and halos with delayed\nor undisturbed star formation are indicated by triangles and circles, respectively. The dotted lines mark the threshold for star formation\nin the evaporated halos, above which it proceeds and below which it is quenched.\n\n\f7\nuniform with neighbor star mass? On one hand, the\ndimmer flux of low-mass Pop III stars causes the front\nto transform from R-type to D-type further out from\nthe center of the halo. We plot velocity profiles for the Ifronts at the moment they become D-type in the nc = 108\ncm\u22123 halo 500 pc from 25 - 120 M\u2299 stars in panel (a) of\nFigure 5. In each profile the transition distance from the\ncore is marked by the position of the forward peak, which\nis at 80, 75, 60, 55 and 50 pc for the 25, 40, 60, 80 and 120\nM\u2299 stars, respectively. On the other hand, lower-mass\nstars are also longer lived, so they drive the I-front into\nthe halo for greater times. This collapses the dispersion\nin I-front positions in the halo to 10 pc by the time the\nstar dies, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 5. In this halo,\nthe I-fronts reach the core with nearly the same velocity,\nwhich is well below the escape speed, with each star.\nThis pattern holds for all halos in which the I-front falls\nshort of the core when the star dies, when star formation\nis delayed or uninterrupted. Note that at early times the\nvelocity profile is split into two smaller peaks. This is\ndue to penetration of hard UV photons into the dense\nshocked gas ahead of the front, which drives a backflow\nin the frame of the shock. This is a common feature of\nI-fronts due to hard UV spectra, as discussed in detail\nin section 4.1 and Figure 17 of Iliev et al. (2009). The\nevolution in spectral profile from 25 - 120 M\u2299 , which\ncauses ionized gas temperatures to rise by more than\n50% in the H II region, accounts for the variation in\npeak velocity in Figure 5. Had each of these I-fronts been\ndriven by a monochromatic flux of the same magnitude\nand duration, the spread in the peaks in radius would\nhave been even less than 10 pc.\nIn the Whalen et al. (2008a) survey, the momentum\nimparted by the relic I-front shock to the core of the halo\nis primarily what determines if a new star forms there.\nHere, in a few cases, the compresssion of the shadow of\nthe halo toward the axis also determines if a star forms.\nIn our new models the halo forms a shadow on the same\ntime scale as a 120 M\u2299 star but pressure from the surrounding relic H II region drives it inward toward the axis\nfor up to twice the time before the star dies, squeezing\na flow backward into the center of the halo. This backflow can slightly displace baryons from the core, as we\nshow in Figure 6 for halo 073 150 pc from a 60 M\u2299 star.\nThe clump of gas originally centered in the dark matter\npotential retains its shape and is at well below the escape speed of the halo. However, its slight dislocation\nfrom the center of the dark matter potential at 10 Myr\nprevents it from collapsing into the star that would have\nformed if only the relic I-front shock had been present.\nBackflows are especially collimated in the axial symmetry we assume in our models but we still expect them\nto be present in three dimensional halos because of their\napproximate sphericity.\nIn halos where stars form without interruption during photoevaporation, molecular hydrogen mass fractions\nrapidly rise from the initialized value of 2 \u00d710\u22126 to 10\u22124\nwhen the star is turned on, even with LW flux, because\nthe core self-shields, as we show for the halo at nc =1596\ncm\u22123 500 pc from 25, 40, 60, and 80 M\u2299 stars in the\nright panel of Figure 7. The core collapses even as the\nouter layers of the halo are stripped away by supersonic\noutflows, and a star forms just as quickly as in the absence of radiation. Since we begin with cosmic mean H2\n\nfractions of 2 \u00d710\u22126 instead of more realistic values of\n10\u22124 for simplicity, ours are lower limits to self-shielding\nand cooling.\nOne departure of the 120 M\u2299 models from the others\nis the delayed star formation at 150 and 250 pc in the\nhalo at nc = 108 cm\u22123 , which does not occur near 25 80 M\u2299 stars. This happens because the shock remnant\ntraverses the core of the halo sooner, allowing gas to later\npool in the dark matter potential and reach its original\ndensity at the center by 10 Myr, as shown by the dashed\nline in the left panel of Figure 7 at 150 pc. Such backfill\nallows a new star to form before a total of 20 Myr has\nelapsed, or about a merger time at z \u223c 20. Similar flows\nwould occur in low-mass runs evolved beyond 10 Myr but\nwould probably not result in a new star prior to severe\ndisruption by a merger. The higher densities at earlier\ntimes in the outer regions of the halo (solid lines in Figure\n7) are due to compression by the relic I-front shock as it\nenvelopes the halo.\nWe find that the higher ratio of LW to ionizing photons of low-mass Population III stars has no effect on\nnearby star formation. The lower fluxes of these stars\noffset their higher ratios, and in any event LW photons\nfrom a single star cannot prevent a new star from forming in a nearby halo prior to the appearance of LW backgrounds at lower redshifts. They can only delay it for\nthe life of the proximate star. Without LW photons halo\ncollapse times at nc \u223c 2000 cm\u22123 are 7 - 10 Myr. At\nsuch densities, Whalen et al. (2008a) find that the core\nbegins to strongly self-shield from local LW flux. If the\ncore could collapse before the arrival of the I-front, its nc\nwould be far greater, be fully shielded from LW flux, and\nform a star anyway. Halos that are completely ionized\nare too diffuse to form a star before the I-front reaches\nthe core even in the absence of LW photons. Cores that\nform a star after the death of a nearby star could not\nhave created one sooner without LW flux because their\nstar formation times are even greater than 7 Myr. Finally, halos that are too severely disrupted by the relic\nI-front shock to form a star cannot collapse prior to the\narrival of the shock in the absence of LW radiation for\nthe same reason. Thus, in none of these outcomes would\na star have formed if there had been no LW flux. In the\nlatter two cases, we find that H2 fractions at the center\nof the halo reacquire their original values 100 - 200 kyr\nafter the star dies and that cooling and collapse of the\ncore begins anew, augmented in some cases by molecular hydrogen advected into it by the relic I-front shock.\nAny suppression or delay of star formation is entirely\ndue to bulk flows driven into the core driven by relic Ifront shock and shadow dynamics, not to the destruction\nof H2 , which quickly reconstitutes in the core after the\nstar dies. Thus, local ionizing UV flux governs new star\nformation in clustered halos, not local LW photons.\nAn exception to this is when the baryons are very\nclose to the star, 25 - 150 pc. In such cases, when\na star is irradiating a clump of baryons in the same\nhalo, Hasegawa et al. (2009) find that clouds with freefall times that are shorter than ionization times can be\nprevented from collapsing by 25 M\u2299 stars because they\nhave the highest LW/ionizing photon ratio. This never\noccurs in our models because of the much lower LW fluxes\nat typical halo distances within the cluster, but such scenarios are quite relevant to the formation of Population\n\n\f8\n\n10\n\n10\n25\n40\n60\n80\n120\n\n25\n40\n60\n80\n120\n\n(a)\n\nv (km/s)\n\n5\n\nv (km/s)\n\n5\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n-5\n-125\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n-75\nr (pc)\n\n-50\n\n-25\n\n-5\n-75\n\n-50\n\n-25\n\n0\n\nr (pc)\n\nFig. 5.- I-front gas velocity profiles through the central axis of the halo for 25, 40, 60, 80, and 120 M\u2299 stars 500 pc from halo 059 (nc =\n108 cm\u22123 ).

Persistent\nLW backgrounds at lower redshifts can by themselves\nprevent secondary star formation in the cluster by not allowing partially evaporated cores to cool after the death\nof the star. However, the exclusion of radiation hydrodynamical effects in past studies may have led them to\noverestimate this effect, as we discuss in \u00a7 5.\n4.2. Kinetic Feedback by SNe\n\nUnlike the 100 - 120 M\u2299 stars assumed in most local\nradiative feedback studies, 25 - 50 M\u2299 stars die in SN explosions (Heger & Woosley 2002; Tominaga et al. 2007).\nTheir remnants can ram-pressure strip baryons from\nnearby halos and prevent them from forming a star when\n\none otherwise would have been created. Sakuma & Susa\n(2009) examined kinetic feedback by SNe on star formation in satellite halos with semi-analytical arguments\nthat neglected radiative preprocessing of the halo by the\nprogenitor star. They found that SNe generally preempt\nany star formation that fails to occur prior to the arrival\nof the remnant at the halo. Cen & Riquelme (2008) simulated the interaction of SN remnants with much more\nmassive halos at lower redshifts to assess the degree to\nwhich metals become mixed with gas deep in their interiors. These calculations, which also excluded prior photoevaporation by UV backgrounds, found some mixing\nin the outer layers of the halos due to Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities but that no metals reached their interiors.\nThese models did not address SNe feedback on star formation because the potential wells of the halos were much\ndeeper than those in which the first stars formed, so the\nremnants could not strip gas from their cores. Detailed\nnumerical models of the collision of primordial supernova\nremnants with the relic H II regions enveloping partially\nexposed cores are needed to establish the actual fate of\nstar formation in these circumstances.\nSupernovae are not invariably fatal to local star formation because the time scales on which the shock\nreaches outlying halos may be longer than those on which\nbaryons collapse within them, and in some cases the remnant never reaches them. Greif et al. (2007) found that\nSN remnants typically expand to only half the radius of\nthe relic H II region of the progenitor because they come\ninto pressure equilibrium relatively quickly in the warm\nrecombining gas. Whalen et al. (2008b) computed the\nradius of the remnant as a function of time for core collapse SNe, hypernovae, and pair-instability SNe (PISN)\nin the fossil H II regions of 105 - 107 M\u2299 . In their simulations, ejecta from the explosions of 15 - 40 M\u2299 stars propagate at most 400 - 500 pc in 10 Myr.

(2008b).\n\nof 15 and 40 M\u2299 SN remnants in those models in Figure\n8. As shown in Figure 10 of Whalen et al. (2008b), the\ngrowth of these remnants does not reproduce the idealized broken power-law radii of canonical SNe, chiefly\nbecause they do not exhibit self-similar behavior. Multiple reverse shocks reverberate throughout the remnant\nover its evolution, and it later violently collides with the\ndense H II region shell formed by its progenitor (see also\nBromm et al. 2003; Kitayama & Yoshida 2005).\nIf we adopt the conservative stance that a SN remnant\nhalts star formation in a halo as soon as it reaches it, and\n\nif the collapse time of the halo at the time of the explosion is known, Figure 3 can be modified to include both\nradiative and kinetic feedback by the star. This is done\nsimply by assuming that if a star can form in the evaporated halo in the absence of an explosion, it will still form\nif central baryon collapse takes less time than required for\nthe shock to reach the halo. The contraction of the cloud\nfrom nc \u223c 10 - 103 to 108 cm\u22123 is leisurely, taking place\nover 5 - 10 Myr (e.g. Abel et al. 2002; O'Shea & Norman\n2007). Thereafter, as three-body H2 cooling takes over\nin the core of the halo, the formation of a star proceeds\nvery rapidly, in under a Myr. We therefore take 8 Myr as\nthe average time for a partially evaporated halo to form\na star. Clearly, this estimate is approximate because it\nneglects the initial LW dissociation of the core, but it is\nreasonable given that our studies show that H2 reforms\nthere 100 - 200 kyr after the death of the star.\nArrival times for the shock at the center of the halo\nare complicated by the fact that they are a function of\nboth the energy of the explosion and the mass of its host\nhalo, as shown in Figure 8. We tabulate minimum and\nmaximum arrival times for the remnant at 150, 250 and\n500 pc in Table 1 using the 15 M\u2299 SN and 40 M\u2299 hypernova from (Whalen et al. 2008b) as proxies for the 25\nand 40 M\u2299 SNe in our study. The evolution of the 15\nM\u2299 remnant is a reasonable approximation to that of\nthe 25 M\u2299 remnant, given the uncertainty in explosion\nenergy in primordial stars over this mass range. The hypernova, whose explosive yield is ten times greater than\nthat of a 40 M\u2299 core-collapse SN, gives a lower limit to\nthe arrival times of the remnant to the halo. The dispersion in times with host halo mass is due to the extra\nbaryons the remnant must sweep aside to reach the halo,\nwhich can vary by more than a factor of ten in mass.\nThe host halos we have chosen, 6.9 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 and 2.1 \u00d7\n106 M\u2299 , bracket those in which the remnant actually es-\n\n\f10\nTABLE 1\nSN Remnant Propagation Times\nSN\n15\n15\n40\n40\n\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\n\nTABLE 2\nAnalytical Fits to Radiative and\nKinetic Feedback\n\nhalo (M\u2299 )\n\nt150pc (yr)\n\nt250pc (yr)\n\nt500pc (yr)\n\n6.9E+05\n2.1E+06\n6.9E+05\n2.1E+06\n\n1.3E+06\n3.5E+06\n3.1E+05\n8.5E+05\n\n5.5E+06\n> 1.0E+07\n1.1E+06\n2.4E+06\n\n> 1.0E+07\n> 1.0E+07\n8.0E+06\n> 1.0E+07\n\ncapes the halo since neither progenitor can ionize halos\ngreater than 107 M\u2299 (Whalen et al. 2008b). Since the\nhypernova remnant, which is the fastest, travels at most\n500 pc in 10 Myr, star formation at 500 and 1000 pc in\nFigure 3 is unchanged.\nWe summarize both radiative and kinetic feedback by\n25 and 40 M\u2299 stars in Figure 9. Ram pressure stripping\nat most preempts delayed star formation in the densest\nhalo ionized by the 25 M\u2299 star at 150 and 250 pc; the\nless destructive of the 25 M\u2299 remnants only halts star\nformation at 150 pc. On the other hand, both 40 M\u2299\nremnants shut down delayed star formation at nc = 1596\ncm\u22123 at 150 and 250 pc. We find that kinetic feedback\nonly modifies radiative feedback in halos at 400 pc or less\nfrom low-mass stars. The picture is more complicated\nwith much more energetic PISN, which can reach any\nhalo within a typical cluster (r . 1000 pc) in under 10\nMyr (Figure 10 of Whalen et al. 2008b). Although the\nremnant overruns the halos sooner, radiative feedback\ncan also speed up baryon collapse beforehand. Whether\nor not stars form in such cases remains unclear, and is\nbeyond the scope of this study.\nWe note that our estimates of kinetic feedback are conservative for several reasons. First, as stated earlier, we\napply arrival times for a 40 M\u2299 hypernova to both 25 and\n40 M\u2299 core-collapse SNe, which have lower energies and\nvelocities, and hence a shorter reach within the cluster.\nSecond, we assume that the halos in our study are not\nconnected by filaments of dark matter and gas, which is\nusually not the case. If both the UV and the SN shock\nmust propagate along a cosmological filament, with overdensities of 50 or more above the cosmic mean, to reach\nthe core of a nearby halo they may have considerably less\nimpact on subsequent star formation there. Finally, we\nalso neglect the collision of the remnant with supersonic\nbackflow from the evaporated halo, which will dampen\nits impact with the core of the halo. Also, 40 - 50 M\u2299\nprimordial stars may die in more exotic explosions such\nas hypernovae or collapsars that are either asymmetric\nor beamed (e.g. Tominaga et al. 2007; Tominaga 2009).\nHowever, the asphericity of such events lowers the likelihood that any one halo in a cluster would be struck by\nejecta, so for simplicity we do not consider them here.\n4.3. Analytical Fits to Local Star Formation at High\n\nRedshift\nIn our previous study we made the distinction between\npositive, negative, and neutral feedback within in a cluster of halos. Negative feedback meant that star formation\nis either delayed or suppressed, positive feedback meant\nthat a star forms more quickly in the halo than when\nthere is no radiation, and neutral feedback meant that a\nstar forms as fast as it would without UV. However, what\nis ultimately of importance to early structure formation\n\nM\u22c6\n25\n40\n60\n80\n\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\nM\u2299\n\na1\n\nb1\n\nc1\n\n3.3010\n3.1761\n3.3010\n3.3010\n\n-0.33474\n-0.49480\n-0.33011\n-0.33084\n\n-0.14613\n0.30103\n9.6910E-02\n-0.69897\n\nand the rise of the first stellar populations is whether or\nnot a star forms in the halo, not its exact timing, which\nvaries by less than a few Myr in the scenarios we have\ninvestigated. Since the final result of neutral, positive,\nor no feedback is the formation of a star, the distinction\nbetween these outcomes is not relevant. Hence, the rules\nwe formulate delineate the basic threshold for star formation in a halo exposed to UV flux and SN flows from\nnearby primordial stars.\nIn Figures 4 and 9 we plot lines that denote the threshold radius rth from the star above which the halo can\nform a star if it is at a central gas density nc and below\nwhich it cannot. The threshold has the simple form\nlog10 rth = a1 + b1 (log10 nc + c1 ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere rth is in pc and nc is in cm\u22123 . We tabulate a1 , b1\nand c1 in Table 2 for 25, 40, 60 and 80 M\u2299 stars, including both radiative and kinetic feedback for 25 and\n40 M\u2299 stars. As shown in Figure 2, radiative feedback\nby 120 M\u2299 stars is even simpler: if the satellite halo has\ncentral densities greater than 100 cm\u22123 a new star will\nform anywhere in the cluster. If not, its formation is\nsuppressed.\n4.4. Ionization Front Instabilities\nLonger illumination times and lower fluxes promote the\nonset of dynamical instabilities in the D-type ionization\nfront as it engulfs the satellite halo, as we show for the\n073 halo 150 pc away from a 25 M\u2299 primordial star in the\nleft panel of Figure 10. They arise because the I-front assumes a cometary shape and because the high energy tail\nof the spectrum forms H2 between the front and the dense\nshell that radiatively cools the shell (e.g. Ricotti et al.\n2001; Whalen & Norman 2008a). Using rigorous perturbation analysis, Williams (2002) discovered that D-type\nfronts driven by photons that are oblique to the front\nare always unstable, and that the growth rates of the\nmodes rise with the angle of incidence of the photons.\nThis, together with cooling of the shocked shell by H2 ,\nis the origin of the instabilities in the I-front enveloping\nthe halo in Figure 10.\nAt early times, we find that the modes with the greatest amplitudes are indeed those furthest out along the arc\nof the I-front, where photons are incident to the front at\nthe greatest angles. At intermediate and later times the\nperturbations grow nonlinearly and degenerate into turbulent fluid motion along the outer segments of the arc.\nThe amplitudes of the modes closest to the axis of the\nhalo are small and instabilities never puncture its core.\nMuch more prominent perturbations have been found\nin planar I-fronts approaching spherical molecular cloud\ncores in numerical models with efficient radiative cooling by molecules (Mizuta et al. 2006). These phenomena\n\n\f11\n\ndistance (pc)\n\n103\n\ndistance (pc)\n\n103\n\n102\n\n102\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nnc (cm-3)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\nnc (cm-3)\n\n103\n\nFig. 9.- Radiative and kinetic feedback on star formation near a 25 M\u2299 star (left) and a 40 M\u2299 star (right). Completely evaporated\nhalos with no star formation are labeled by crosses, while halos with delayed or neutral star formation are marked by triangles and circles,\nrespectively. The triangle overlaid on the cross in the 25 M\u2299 panel signifies that the halo can form a delayed star if the SN goes off in\nthe 6.9 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 halo but not if it is in the 2.1 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 halo. The dotted lines again define the boundary for star formation in the\nevaporated halos, above which it proceeds and below which it is quenched.\n\nFig. 10.- Temperatures at 600 kyr (left) and H2 mass fractions at 10 Myr (right) in halo 073 (nc = 1596 cm\u22123 ) 150 pc from a 25 M\u2299\nstar.\n\nhave been proposed for the origin of the \"Pillars of Creation\" in the Orion Nebula, but they are different from\nthose in our simulations. They begin as Vishniac thinshell overstabilities (Vishniac 1983) caused by efficient\nmolecular cooling in plane-parallel I-fronts, not curved\nones, and later erupt into violent instabilities driven by\nionizing radiation. In the Mizuta et al. (2006) models the\nunstable modes do propagate into the molecular cloud\ncore. This never occurs in our simulations because H2\ncooling is too inefficient to incite Vishniac modes.\nWe point out these features because they are promi-\n\nnent in many of our models, but they do not affect star\nformation in the halo because they never approach its\ninner regions. Mostly, they just roil gas along the shock,\nbreaking it up into clumps that can persist for up to 10\nMyr. We find that they appear when the star is 150 or\n250 pc from the halo and are most prominent with 25\nand 40 M\u2299 stars. Fewer instabilities appear as stellar\nmass increases; they arise in only two of the 120 M\u2299\nmodels and have lower amplitudes. There are two reasons for this. First, higher mass stars have greater LW\nfluxes that lower H2 cooling in the dense shell. Second,\n\n\f12\nlarger ionizing UV fluxes result in shorter-lived cometary\nprofiles in which unstable modes can develop. The arc\nis crushed downward into the shadow of the halo more\nquickly and the instabilities have less time to develop.\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe find that 25 - 120 M\u2299 primordial stars are relatively\nuniform in their effect on new star formation within clusters of small halos at high redshifts, before the rise of\nglobal LW backgrounds. The evolution in spectral profile from 25 - 120 M\u2299 has no impact on the formation\nof stars in nearby halos, which allows its removal from\nthe parameter space of local radiative feedback. The\nempirical fits we have devised mark the threshold for\nstar formation in satellite halos as a function of central\nbaryon density, proximity to the star, and neighbor star\nmass. Although the halo in our study is the just the\nleast massive one found to form a star in previous AMR\nsimulations, our results can be used as upper limits to\nfeedback in more massive halos. Our results imply that\nfuture surveys of local feedback with more massive halos can be accomplished with fewer stars, since outcomes\nfor halo photoevaporation above and below the belt in\nnc and radius in which there is variability is relatively\nuniform from 25 - 80 M\u2299 .\nRadiative and kinetic feedback between minihalos is\nkey to many processes in early cosmological structure formation, such as primordial SNe event rates (Wise & Abel\n2005), especially those that account for cluster bias\n(MacIntyre et al. 2006), the rise of the first stellar populations, the assembly of primeval galaxies, and the evolution of metagalactic LW backgrounds. Our analytical\nfits enable feedback estimates for a representative cut of\nPopulation III stars in analytical models of these early\nprocesses. They can also be used in numerical simulations, especially those performed in large cosmological\nboxes capable of resolving minihalo clustering but not of\ncapturing halo photoevaporation.\nLocal radiative feedback at slightly lower redshifts is\ndifferent due to the presence of LW backgrounds from primordial stars, which until recently has been thought to be\nquite destructive to new star formation mediated by H2\ncooling in halos (Haiman et al. 1997, 2000; Yoshida et al.\n2003). However, recent, more detailed simulations reveal that star formation in cosmological halos is postponed rather than prevented in LW backgrounds, even\nlarge ones that are consistent with a fully reionized\nuniverse (Wise & Abel 2007; O'Shea & Norman 2008).\nWise & Abel (2007) found that a halo that formed a star\nat 5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 in the absence of a photodissociative background still formed one by H2 cooling 50 Myr later after\nit grew by mergers and accretion to 5 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 in a\nuniform LW field of 1 J21 (= 10\u221221 erg cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 str\u22121\ns\u22121 ), that of a fully-ionized universe. Other halos in its\nvicinity also grew to larger masses, even though cooling and collapse of baryons were temporarily stalled in\nthem. Thus, at lower redshifts local UV feedback still begins when one star irradiates neighbor halos. In contrast\nto the first generation, LW backgrounds may continue to\nsuppress star formation in photoevaporated halos after\nthe death of the star by slowing the formation of H2 in\nthe relic H II region, the remnant I-front shock, and the\n\nhalo core.\nHowever, this effect may have been overestimated in\nprevious analyses. Consider the morphology and large\ndensities and H2 fractions in the relic H II region at 10\nMyr in the right panel of Figure 10. Similar H2 fractions\nwould likely persist in the recombining H II region even\nin large LW backgrounds because the very high electron\nfractions there restore it so quickly via the H\u2212 channel.\nThis is especially true in the high densities of the I-front\nshock remnant, that can be seen to envelope the core\nin Figure 10. Enough molecular hydrogen could be catalyzed in the envelope to expel the LW background from\nits interior, allowing H2 to reform at the center of the\nhalo, cool it, and form a star. Thus, photoevaporation\nmay actually free satellite halos to form stars that were\npreviously suppressed by the background. This, together\nwith our current study, suggests that star formation in\ncosmological halos at lower redshift was much more robust than is often supposed. Numerical models are now\nbeing developed to investigate the survival of molecular\nhydrogen, and therefore new star formation, in evaporated halos for a range LW backgrounds.\nThe effect of photoevaporation on the final mass of any\nstar that does form in the halo is not yet well understood,\nbut initial estimates by Susa et al. (2009) suggest that it\nwill be smaller than in undisturbed halos. They find that\noutflows and shock disruption in the core lower central\naccretion rates, and by extrapolating these rates from\nearly stages of collapse out to Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction time scales, they conclude that the final star will\nbe 25 - 50 M\u2299 . This mass scale is similar to those on\nwhich Pop III.2 stars form due to HD cooling in relic\nH II regions (Yoshida et al. 2007). HD is important because it can cool primordial H II regions down to the\nCMB temperature and lower the mass scales on which\nthey fragment. However, we do not include it in our\nmodels because it forms primarily in the relic ionized\ngas surrounding the halo core, not in the core itself.\nAlthough our study is a significant extension to our\nearlier survey of local radiative feedback, additional feedback channels remain to be properly investigated. If\nthe death of the star results in a black hole, accretion would expose nearby halos to its soft x-ray flux\n(Machacek et al. 2003; Alvarez et al. 2009), creating significant free electron fractions in them due to secondary\nionizations without strongly heating them. This process\ncould enhance their H2 mass fractions and promote their\ncollapse into new stars. Likewise, the impact of SN ejecta\nwith a halo that has been partially stripped by supersonic\nflows could deposit metals into its interior and accelerate\nits cooling and collapse. These potential avenues of positive feedback on primordial star formation will be the\nfocus of future simulations.\n\nThis work was carried out under the auspices of the\nNational Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy at Los Alamos National Laboratory\nunder Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25396.
