In their analysis of nearby clusters, Dressler (1980) and Whitmore\net al. (1993) agreed that the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases from 80% in the \"field\", to 60%\nin the outskirts to virtually zero in the cores of rich clusters, compensated by an opposite increase\nof elliptical and S0 galaxies. Morphological segregation is perhaps the clearest signature of the\nenvironmental dependence of the processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies.\nUnderstanding the morphology segregation, i.e. the shaping of the Hubble sequence in the various\nenvironments, has challenged astronomers for years: \"Nature or Nurture\"? The issue is still hotly\ndebated, as it involves many controversial fields of modern astrophysics, including observations,\nsimulations and theories.\nWith the advent of 10m class telescopes we hope that galaxy evolution will be shortly disclosed\nobservationally, much as in a rewound movie taken along the \"fossil\" sequence, from today's fully\nevolved nearby galaxies to the early objects forming their first stars far away in space and time.\nSimilarly we can imagine to shoot the movie of the morphology segregation by comparing frames\nof clusters taken at increasingly large z. Snapshots at z = 0 would show the fully formed and\nevolved clusters with their final mix of E/S0/S. Frames taken between z = 0.2 and 0.5 would show\nan unchanged fraction of E, with the action focused on increasingly active spirals (the ButcherOemler effect (Butcher & Oemler 1978, 1984)) and a decreasing fraction of S0 (Dressler et al. 1997;\nDressler 2004). By z = 0.5 \u2212 1 the scene would be on clusters under formation, when large groups\nof galaxies coalesce. Effective \"pre-processing\" is taking place in these low velocity-dispersion\nenvironments, where minor merging and tidal interactions among galaxies are shaping up the S0s\n(Mihos 2004; Fujita 2004). None has yet observed elliptical galaxies under formation at z = 3 and\nbeyond. But there is general consent that they should have formed at these early epochs, very much\nfrom \"nature\" and little from \"nurture\", even before clusters existed (Dressler 2004; Treu 2004;\nNolan 2004; Franx 2004). Maybe in a decade from now, when the JWST will provide these last\nphotograms, the full movie of the shaping of the Hubble sequence will be on view, as many groups\nof researchers are focusing large efforts on it (the Morphs group (Dressler et al. 1999), the CNOC1\ngroup (Yee et al. 1996), the ACSCS team (Postman et al. 1996), the EDisCS group (Halliday et al.\n2004) and the team of van Dokkum and collaborators (van Dokkum et al. 2000)).\nThis is perhaps somewhat optimistic, however. Pretending to understand galaxy evolution really\nmeans shooting a movie whose individual photograms are composed of SEDs, obtained combining\nbest quality data taken over a large stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, each individual band\nproviding information on the evolution of a particular galaxy component. Restframe UV fluxes and\nBalmer emission line strengths are the best current, massive star-formation tracers. Optical bands\nprovide the morphology, NIR bands trace the oldest stars, MIR and FIR the dust (and extinction);\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe radio (continuum) tells about the nuclear activity, the supernova rate and the magnetic fields,\nand the 21 cm line the primordial gas reservoir and its dynamics.\nThe problem is that, as z increases, characteristic features become unobservable or more difficult\nto observe. By z = 1, for example, the H\u03b1 line ends up in the H band, a noisy place to carry\nout observations. The peak of the dust emission falls in the sub-mm bands where the sensitivity\nof telescopes will remain poor until ALMA. The 21 cm line drops to lower sensitivity and angular\nresolution bands where line correlators do not yet exist (we are not aware of a single HI emission\nmeasurement taken beyond z=0.15). Furthermore, the movie's linear resolution decreases with z, so\nthat detailed morphological information quickly fades away. Most dramatic is the lost of sensitivity\nwith increasing z. By z < 0.2 dwarf galaxies run completely out of the scene. Meaningful, highresolution SEDs in the whole luminosity range covered by galaxies are obtainable only at z = 0,\nproviding the boundary conditions to models and simulations of galaxy evolution.\nThe end point of the evolution is within the reach of modern telescopes. Significantly less evolved\ngalaxies can only be observed, with lower resolution, if they are more luminous. Dwarf galaxies, Ims,\nBCDs and dEs, by far the most common types of galaxies in the universe, yet the less understood,\ncan only be observed locally.\nSince the rate of evolution of galaxies is found to correlate primarily with their dynamical mass\n(infrared luminosity) according to a remarkably anti-hierarchical scheme (Gavazzi (1993); Gavazzi\n& Scodeggio (1996); Gavazzi et al. (1996); Boselli et al. (2001); Gavazzi et al. (2002a); Scodeggio\net al. (2002a)) that has been lately named \"downsizing\" , distant surveys might undersample lowluminosity, slowly evolving systems. This is why studying nearby clusters still is a worthwhile\nactivity.\nAnother pro of local clusters is that they are ideal laboratories for studying interaction mechanisms\nat high resolution. Prototypes of all relevant mechanisms can be found in nearby clusters. Abell\n1367, for example, contains perhaps the best known example of currently ongoing ram-pressure\nstripping (CGCG 97-073), a rare example of a merging system in a cluster (UGC 6697) and even\na local prototype of infalling group where pre-processing occurs at the present cosmological epoch\n(see Section 4.10). Infall was much more effective, but unfortunately hard to observe, in the past\n(z \u223c 0.5), when it contributed shaping the S0 galaxies (pre-processing).\nSo far we insisted on the importance of observing nearby clusters. Among them we have focused the\npresent review on three specific ones: Virgo, Abell 1367 and Coma that are among the best studied\nin the universe. The variety of their conditions, e.g. spiral fraction, X-ray luminosity, kinematic\nproperties, makes them suitable \"laboratories\" for comparing clusters in different evolutionary\nstages: near formation (Virgo), still significantly accreting (A1367), near virialization (Coma).\nHonestly speaking, the present review was conceived while we were assembling \"GOLDmine\", the\ngalaxy database that we made available on the WEB (goldmine.mib.infn.it) (Gavazzi et al. 2003a).\nTwo third of the galaxies contained in GOLDmine belong in fact to these three clusters and a\nsignificant fraction of them are among the best sampled SEDs. This does not mean that we haven't\ntried to review the work of other groups. Certainly we haven't done it as extensively as we should,\nand we apologize for that.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nBut why focusing the present review on late-type galaxies, that are less numerous, they evolve slower\nthan the more intriguing S0s and Es? What can we learn from the handful late-type galaxies that\nstill inhabit local clusters? There are several reasons for concentrating on them. One is that, due\nto the fragility of their stellar and gaseous disks, they are sensitive probes of their environment.\nAnother is that, since their rate of evolution (star formation history) is mild and continuous, they\nprovide a linear clock for evolution, as opposed to E whose action occurred suddenly in one brief\nand intense episode that occurred early in their life. Spirals are also interesting because significant\ninfall of galaxies of this type has occurred and is still occurring (at decreasing rate due to the \u039b\ndominated universe) onto clusters of galaxies. Will they sooner or later evolve into lenticulars?\nCan we use them as probes of the cluster environment? To help better focusing the addressed\n\nFig. 1.- The celestial distribution of galaxies brighter than 15.7 from the CGCG catalogue, Zwicky\net al. (1968) in a 4x4 deg2 box around the Coma cluster. The 146 early-type (E+S0+S0a) galaxies\n(empty symbols) clearly mark the cluster density enhancement, whereas the 49 late-type (\u2265Sa)\nobjects (filled symbols, including 10 unclassified spirals) hardly trace the cluster. The circle of 1\ndegree radius is traced about the X-ray center. The X-ray contours from XMM are superposed.\nissues, let's take a look at the Coma cluster whose bright galaxy distribution is shown in Figure\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n1. The early-type galaxies clearly mark the cluster density enhancement, whereas the late-type\nobjects hardly trace the cluster at all, making Abell (1965) to doubt their very membership to\nthe Coma cluster. The latter are very \"healthy\" objects, actively star forming, as witnessed by\ntheir average H\u03b1 E.W. (equivalent width) of 35 \u00c5 (with peaks of 78 \u00c5). This perhaps explains\nwhy Abell questioned their membership to Coma, because the majority of galaxies observed in\nclusters shows no signs of recent star formation activity. He didn't know that some of these objects\nare not as in \"good shape\" as it looks at first glance, something that was realized 20 years later.\nThe pioneering work of Giovanelli & Haynes (1985), continued by many other researchers, among\nthem Gavazzi (1987, 1989), showed in fact that galaxies at projected distances < 1 Mpc from the\ncenter of Coma suffer from significant neutral hydrogen deficiency (see Section 2.1), having lost\nfrom 30 % to 90 % of their original HI content. The first resolved map of their HI distribution\nwas obtained even more recently by Bravo-Alfaro et al. (2000). It shows that in most highly or\nmoderately deficient objects the HI distribution is asymmetric or significantly displaced from the\nparent optical galaxy. This phenomenon occurs in objects projected within the X-ray emitting gas\nin the Coma cluster. For the interpretation of this observation, whether is due to ram-pressure\nstripping or to galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-cluster interactions, the reader is referred to the remaining\nof the discussion. However, generally speaking, a high HI deficiency represents perhaps the clearest\nsignature of the interaction occurring to galaxies in the environment of rich clusters, in other words\nit gives a clear clue to their cluster membership. Abell was wrong! These are bona fide cluster\nmembers. What future is reserved to these galaxies? This is the type of issue addressed by the\npresent review. The reader can find many excellent review papers in the literature that deal with\nthe evolution of galaxies in the cluster environment (Haynes et al. 1984; Dressler 1984; Sarazin\n1986; Dressler et al. 1997; Poggianti et al. 2001a; Driver & De Propris 2003; van Gorkom 2004)\neach focused on a particular aspect or wavelength domain. The most recent achievements in cluster\nresearch are collected in the proceedings of the Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series, Vol. 3:\nClusters of Galaxies: Probes of Cosmological Structure and Galaxy Evolution (2004). With the\npresent review we wish, for the first time, to consider together all aspects. The price we pay is that\nwe must narrow down the reviewed interval of z, in practice to z=0. We start by reviewing the\nobservational scenario (Sections 2, 3), covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, from the gas tracers (radio and optical), the star formation tracers (UV and optical),\nthe old star tracers (Near-IR) and the dust (Far-IR). We continue by providing a review of models\nof galaxy interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies (Section 4). We conclude with a discussion\non what proposed model(s) better interprets various aspects of the observational scenario (Section\n5), once again checking the models predictions on recent data on Virgo, Coma and A1367.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.\n\nThe constituents of late-type galaxies in nearby clusters: comparison with the\n\"field\"\n2.1.\n\nThe atomic hydrogen\n\nThe atomic gas is the principal component of the ISM in late-type galaxies, supplying the\n\"fuel\" that feeds the star formation. In normal, isolated galaxies the HI gas distribution outstands\nthe optical disk: column densities of \u223c 1020 atoms cm\u22122 are observed at \u223c 1.8 the optical diameter, with a relatively flat radial distribution, sometimes showing a central dip (Cayatte et al. 1994;\nSalpeter & Hoffman 1996; Broeils & Rhee 1997). The HI extension in the direction perpendicular\nto the disk is comparable to the optical thickness (Lee & Irwin 1997).\nBecause of its distribution the HI gas is weakly bound by the galaxy's gravitational potential well,\nthus it can be easily removed. It is therefore obvious to expect that the HI content and distribution\nof galaxies in clusters differ from those of isolated galaxies (see the reviews by Haynes et al. (1984);\nvan Gorkom (2004)). The first study of the atomic gas properties of galaxies in the Virgo cluster\ndates back to the sixties (Robinson & Koehler 1965). Since then, several HI surveys of this and\nother nearby clusters were carried out using single dish radiotelescopes (Giovanelli & Haynes 1985)\nand interferometers (Warmels 1988; Cayatte et al. 1990; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000). Owing to the\nsurvey of Hoffman et al. (1996) and to recent Arecibo observations (e.g. Gavazzi et al. (2005b)) HI\ndata are available for the entire late-type galaxy population in the Virgo cluster, including dwarf\nirregulars and BCDs.\nAll works agree on the general conclusion that cluster galaxies have on average a lower atomic gas\ncontent than their isolated counterparts, as first noticed by Davies & Lewis (1973). A quantitative\ndetermination of this difference could however not be assessed before the systematic HI properties of isolated galaxies were known. This fundamental step was achieved by Haynes & Giovanelli\n(1984) who studied at Arecibo a reference sample selected from the Karachentseva (1973) catalogue of isolated galaxies. Haynes & Giovanelli (1984) defined the HI-deficiency parameter as the\nlogarithmic difference between the observed HI mass and the expected value in isolated objects of\nsimilar morphological type and linear size. Galaxies with an HI-deficiency parameter \u2264 0.3 can be\ntreated as unperturbed objects1 .\nBy comparing the statistical HI properties of galaxies in 9 nearby clusters with those of \"field\"\nobjects of similar type and luminosity, Haynes et al. (1984) and Giovanelli & Haynes (1985) showed\nthat clusters contain a large fraction of HI deficient galaxies, with the exception of unrelaxed, loose\nones. This fraction is a strong function of the angular distance from the X-ray center (Gavazzi\n1989; Boselli 1994).\nDressler (1986), by re-analyzing the Haynes & Giovanelli (1984) catalogue showed that the most deficient galaxies are generally early-type spirals in radial orbits, while gas-rich galaxies have isotropic\nor circular orbits (confirmed by Solanes et al. (2001)). Solanes et al. (2001), analyzing the HI prop1\n\nThe isolated sample by Haynes & Giovanelli (1984) is mainly composed of giant galaxies. The HI-deficiency\nparameter of dwarf objects is therefore poorly calibrated\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nerties of \u223c 1900 galaxies in 18 nearby clusters, concluded that 2/3 of the clusters are composed\nof HI deficient galaxies inside the Abell radius RA . The residuals of the deficiency parameter is\nrelated to the galaxy morphology and not to their optical size: early-type spirals and probably\ndwarfs are more deficient than Sbc-Sc at any radii inside 2RA . The deficiency increases toward the\ncluster center, being significant for r < RA . They did not confirm the relationship between the\nfraction of HI-deficient galaxies and the cluster X-ray luminosity claimed by Giovanelli & Haynes\n(1985).\nGavazzi et al. (2005c) have completed the HI observations of late-type CGCG galaxies in the Coma\nsupercluster. One important issue that they were able to address, given the completeness of their\ndata-set, is on what scale the phenomenon of HI ablation holds. The HI deficiency parameter of\nindividual galaxies is given in Fig.2 as a function of the projected linear separation from the X-ray\ncenter of the Coma cluster, out to 15 Mpc, along with average values taken in bins of 0.5\u25e6 (from\n0\u25e6 to 2\u25e6 ) and in bins of 1\u25e6 further out. It is apparent that significant HI deficiency occurs out to\napproximately 3 Mpc radius. Little above one virial radius (i.e. at 2.2 Mpc, Girardi et al. (1998)),\nthe average HI content of the supercluster galaxies becomes indistinguishable from that of the field,\nin agreement with Solanes et al. (2001). We stress that the filaments constituting the \"Homunculus legs\" (de Lapparent et al. 1986), i.e. the groups/filaments in the immediate surrounding of the\nComa cluster, perhaps infalling toward Coma (not shown in Fig.2), are made of galaxies retaining\n100 % of their HI content, identical to unperturbed, isolated galaxies.\nThe HI survey of the Virgo cluster has also been completed by Gavazzi et al. (2005b), allowing to\ndetermine the radial distribution of the HI deficiency parameter of all spirals brighter than 18.0\nmag (only mp < 13.0 mag are plotted in Fig.2 for consistency with Coma). Unfortunately for\nVirgo the survey does not extend out in the low density region of the local supercluster as much\nas in Coma, but only out to 3.2 Mpc. We find that in Virgo there is a significant population of\nnon-deficient galaxies at all radii, mixed with highly deficient (>1) ones. These exist within 2.2\nMpc, just above 1 virial radius (i.e. at 1.7 Mpc, Girardi et al. (1998)). Furthermore it is found that\nindividual groups constituting the Virgo cluster (cloud N and S for example) contain less than 10\n% highly deficient objects, compared to 33% in Cluster A (M87).\nHigh resolution HI mapping of galaxies in the Virgo cluster with the Westerbork (Warmels 1988)\nand VLA (Cayatte et al. 1990) interferometers, and more recently in the Coma cluster (BravoAlfaro et al. 2000) revealed that cluster galaxies not only suffer from significant HI depletion, but\nthat their HI distribution is less extended than isolated objects of similar morphological type and\nluminosity (Warmels 1988; Cayatte et al. 1994; Boselli et al. 2002).\nWhile in normal isolated late-type galaxies the HI diameter (as measured at the 1020 atoms cm\u22122\nisophote) is on average a factor of \u223c 1.8 larger than the optical isophotal B band 25 mag arcsec\u22122\ndiameter (somewhat depending on the morphological type), in cluster objects the HI to optical diameter ratio strongly depends on the HI-deficiency parameter and on the distance from the cluster\ncenter (Warmels 1988; Cayatte et al. 1994). The most HI-deficient objects close to the X-ray center\nof Virgo have HI diameters up to \u223c 5 times smaller than the optical ones (Cayatte et al. 1994).\nAnemic galaxies whose HI disks are slightly smaller than the optical ones, have significantly lower\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The projected distribution about the X-ray center of the HI deficiency of similar luminosity\nlate-type members of the Coma (left) and Virgo clusters (right).

(2005c,b)).\nHI column densities (by a factor of \u223c 10) than normal, isolated objects of similar morphological\ntype (Cayatte et al. 1994). The HI surface density correlates tightly with the HI-deficiency parameter (Boselli et al. 2002). Asymmetries in the HI distribution and displacements of the gas from the\noptical parent galaxies are frequently observed in moderately HI deficient objects (Gavazzi 1989;\nCayatte et al. 1994; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000; Vogt et al. 2004).\nThe HI mass function of the Virgo cluster was found by Gavazzi et al. (2005b) to differ\nsignificantly from the one in the \"field\" due to the combined effect of morphology segregation and\npresence of HI-deficient objects. A similar result was recently obtained by Springob et al. (2005)\nwho found, on average, a decrease of M\u2217 and a flattening of the low-mass end of the HI mass\nfunction in high density environments.\nThe recently initiated Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey aims to map \u223c7000 deg2 of\nthe high Galactic latitude sky visible from Arecibo (Giovanelli et al. 2005b). The survey will detect\non the order of 20,000 extragalactic H I line sources out to z \u223c 0.06 and enable a first wide-area\nblind search for local H I emitters. Environmental studies will greatly benefit from this survey.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n2.2.\n\nThe molecular hydrogen\n\nThe molecular gas phase, even if it represents only \u223c 15 % of the total gas reservoir in normal,\nlate-type galaxies (Boselli et al. 2002), is the component of the ISM that takes direct part to\nthe process of star formation. The HI gas has in fact to condense inside molecular clouds before\ncollapsing to form stars. It is thus expected that any possible external perturbation induced by the\nenvironment on the molecular gas can have important consequences on the star formation activity,\nand thus on the evolution of late-type galaxies.\nEarly systematic works aimed at determining the molecular gas properties of late-type galaxies\nin clusters are the CO surveys of Virgo by Stark et al. (1986), Kenney & Young (1988a) and\nBoselli et al. (1995a) and that of Coma by Casoli et al. (1991). Using a standard conversion factor\nX=n(H2 )/I(CO) between the intensity of the CO line and the column density of the molecular\nhydrogen calibrated on the Milky Way, these authors estimated the molecular hydrogen mass\nM (H2 ) of cluster galaxies. Their immediate conclusion was that cluster galaxies have a normal\nmolecular gas content and the interpretation was that molecular gas, being more centrally peaked,\ndeep inside the potential well of the galaxy, than the atomic gas, cannot be easily removed by any\nstripping mechanism (Kenney & Young 1989; Rengarajan & Iyengar 1992). Molecular gas removal\ncould be effective only in low-mass galaxies with shallow potential wells, explaining the apparent\nCO deficiency of low-luminosity Virgo galaxies (Kenney & Young 1988b).\nThis result suffers however from several biases. It firstly resides on the hypothesis that the relation\nbetween the CO line intensity and the H2 gas column density is universal. Boselli et al. (2002)\nshowed however that X varies by more than a factor of 10 over the sampled range of UV radiation\nfield, metallicity, morphological type and luminosity. The second limitation is the lack of a CO\nreference sample of isolated galaxies selected according to criteria similar to the cluster (Boselli\net al. 1997a). For example the CO survey by Casoli et al. (1991) is mostly FIR selected, thus\nbiased toward strong CO emitters (Boselli et al. 1995b).\nTo overcome these difficulties Boselli et al. (1997a) and Sauty et al. (2003) obtained CO observation\nof an optically selected sample of isolated galaxies. They applied a luminosity-dependent CO to\nH2 conversion factor, calibrated on the nearby galaxies with an independent measure of X:\nlogX = \u22120.38(\u00b10.06)logLH + 24.23(\u00b10.24)\n\n(mol cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 )\n\n(1)\n\nFrom a H band luminosity-H2 mass relation calibrated on the reference sample of isolated galaxies\nselected following similar criteria (Boselli et al. 2002):\nlogM (H2 )e = 3.28(\u00b10.39) + 0.51(\u00b10.05)logLH\n\n(in solar units)\n\n(2)\n\nthey obtained, in full analogy with the HI deficiency (Haynes & Giovanelli 1984) an H2 deficiency\nparameter defined as:\nDefH2 = logM (H2 )e \u2212 logM (H2 )o\n(3)\nwhere M (H2 )e is the expected molecular gas mass of a galaxy of a given H luminosity as determined\nfrom eq. 2 and M (H2 )o is the observed molecular gas mass (Boselli et al. 2002).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe lack of relationship between the HI and the H2 deficiency parameters confirms and extends to\nlower luminosities similar previous claims obtained in Coma (Boselli et al. 1997a; Casoli et al. 1991)\nand in Virgo (Kenney & Young 1989; Boselli 1994). The low luminosity, CO deficient spiral galaxies\nfound in Virgo by Kenney & Young (1988b) are not necessarily deficient in molecular hydrogen\nsince their H2 mass was probably underestimated assuming a constant X conversion factor.\nWe conclude that cluster galaxies are significantly deficient in atomic hydrogen, but their molecular\ncontent is, on average, normal.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe metal content\n\nMetals are produced and injected into the interstellar medium by massive stars through stellar\nwinds and supernova explosions. They play a fundamental role in the process of star formation.\nSince they are produced by stars during their evolution, they can be used to constrain the star\nformation history of galaxies.\nSkillman et al. (1996) analyzed the effects of the environment on the metal content of spiral galaxies\nby comparing the metallicity gradients observed in 9 objects in the Virgo cluster with similar\nmeasurements of isolated objects of equal type. The 9 galaxies were selected to span a large range\nin HI-deficiency and angular distance from the cluster center. HI-deficient galaxies in the center of\nVirgo have, on average, higher metallicity (0.3 to 0.5 dex in O/H) than HI normal galaxies at the\nperiphery of the cluster or isolated objects with similar morphology and luminosity (Skillman et al.\n1996; Pilyugin et al. 2002). Moreover Skillman et al. (1996) showed that HI deficient Virgo galaxies\nhave shallower abundance gradients than normal objects. Gavazzi et al. (2006, in preparation)\nrecently analyzed the HI-deficiency metallicity relation using integrated long slit spectra of a large\nsample of \u223c 300 galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in the Coma/A1367 supercluster. Their analysis\n(Fig.3) shows that the most HI deficient galaxies have on average larger metallicities than similar\nobjects with a normal gas content, confirming the results of Skillman et al. (1996) 2 . A similar trend\nwas also observed for the dwarfs, which, in dense environments, seem to have higher metallicities\nthan isolated objects (Vilchez 1995). The unanimous interpretation of this finding is that metals\nin cluster galaxies are less diluted in the unpolluted gas, due to HI ablation.\n\n2.4.\n\nThe dust\n\nDust grains of different size and composition build up from metals produced by stars and\ninjected into the ISM by stellar winds and supernovae explosions. Dust plays an important role in\n2\n\nRemember however that the trend between metallicity residual and HI-deficiency is exclusively observed when\nmetallicities are determined using the calibration of van Zee et al. (1998) which is based on [NII]/H\u03b1. Due to a\nbias, the other two methods, requiring the detection of [OIII], H\u03b2 and [OII], cannot be applied to highly HI deficient\ngalaxies because these lines are not detected in these objects.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The relationship between the residual from the metallicity (12+Log(O/H)) vs. luminosity\n(LV ) relation and the HI deficiency parameter.

Squares\nrepresent Sa-Sb, triangles Sbc-Scd, pentagons Sd-Im-BCD.\nthe process of star formation since atoms of hydrogen condense on dust grains to form H2 molecules\n(Hollenbach et al. 1971). The interstellar dust is observable in absorption at ultraviolet and optical\nwavelengths and in emission in the mid- and far-IR, as the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS)\ndramatically revealed (Soifer et al. 1987). While most of the flux emitted by dust in normal galaxies\nis in the 60-200 \u03bcm domain (e.g. Boselli et al. (2003a)) (relatively warm, Tdust =30 K big grains),\nthe bulk of the dust mass is colder (Tdust \u2264 15 K), and it radiates in the sub-mm domain at > 100\u03bcm\n(Bianchi et al. 1999). At intermediate wavelengths (15-60 \u03bcm) the emission is dominated by very\nsmall grains, while in the mid-IR (5-15 \u03bcm) it comes mostly from unidentified infrared bands (UIB),\nprobably associated to planar molecules, called PAHs (Desert et al. 1990).\nDust is generally associated with the gaseous component: the dust to gas column density ratio is\nrelatively well correlated to the metallicity of the ISM, and thus it varies with galaxy morphology\nand/or luminosity or, within a galaxy, it follows the metallicity gradient. It is thus expected that\npart of the dust associated with the atomic gas can be removed from cluster spirals and might\ncontribute to the IGM pollution 3 .\nThe mid-IR (5-18 \u03bcm) emission per unit galaxy mass of normal, late-type galaxies in the Virgo\n3\n\nFor a recent review on the infrared properties of clusters of galaxies observed by ISO see Metcalfe et al. (2005)\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The differential far-IR to near-IR (F (100 \u03bcm)/H) distribution in seven nearby clusters\n(dots) and in the reference sample of isolated galaxies (continuum line).\ncluster does not depend on the distance from the cluster center (Boselli et al. 1998), thus it can\nbe tentatively concluded that the carriers of the IR bands, dominating the emission at these wavelengths, are not affected by the cluster environment.\nUsing far-IR IRAS data for a sample of \u223c 200 galaxies in 7 nearby clusters, Bicay & Giovanelli\n(1987) showed that optically selected cluster galaxies have a normal far-IR (60-100 \u03bcm) emission.\nThere is however a lack of bright (LF IR >1011 L\u2299) galaxies in clusters, and there is also a trend\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nbetween the dust temperature and the HI deficiency, with HI deficient objects having colder dust.\nThis result was confirmed in the Virgo cluster by Doyon & Joseph (1989), who also found that\nHI-deficient galaxies have slightly lower 60 and 100 \u03bcm flux densities per unit optical area than HI\nnormal galaxies.\nUsing far-IR flux densities normalized to the photographic magnitude, Gavazzi (1988) showed that\nthe far-IR luminosity function of isolated and cluster galaxies are similar, except for the lack of\nobjects with high far-IR to optical ratio, as claimed by Bicay & Giovanelli (1987).\nUsing the data on 9 nearby clusters and on the Great Wall (reference sample) obtained from\nGOLDmine we re-determined the far-IR luminosity distribution (see Fig. 4), but this time using\nfar-IR (100 \u03bcm) normalized to H band flux densities4 . As for the far-IR to optical luminosity\n\nFig. 5.- The relationship between the total dust mass normalized to the H band luminosity and\na) the angular distance from the cluster center and b) the HI deficiency parameter for Virgo cluster\ngalaxies observed at 170 \u03bcm with ISOPHOT. Filled dots are for HI detected galaxies, arrows for\nundetected objects (upper limits to the HI mass).\ndistribution, we do not observe any systematic difference between cluster and \"field\" galaxies. The\nemission of normal galaxies in the 60-100 \u03bcm range is however primarily dictated by the intensity\nof the UV and visible stellar radiation field, and only marginally by the dust mass. Therefore the\nabove test is not sufficient to exclude dust removal in cluster galaxies.\nThe lack of homogeneously selected photometric data in the range 100 \u03bcm-1 mm for cluster and\n4\n\nNormalizations are necessary to remove the first order dependences on luminosity (\"bigger galaxies have more\nof everything\"). As shown by Gavazzi et al. (1996), the proper normalization is the one obtained using the near-IR\nH band luminosity because this parameter traces the total dynamical mass of galaxies, it suffers from low internal\nextinction and it is not affected by recent events of star formation.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The relationship between the 100 to 170 \u03bcm flux density ratio and the HI deficiency parameter for Virgo cluster galaxies. Filled dots are for HI detected galaxies, arrows for HI undetected\nobjects. The dashed line represents the best fit to the data.\nisolated galaxies prevents us from studying the possible effects of the environment on the cold dust\ncomponent using a similar statistical approach. At present the only systematic observations at this\nwavelength are the ISOPHOT 170 \u03bcm data of 63 late-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster by Tuffs\net al. (2002). Using these data we show in Fig. 5 the relationship between the total dust mass\n(defined as the sum of the cold and warm dust masses given by Tuffs et al. (2002), normalized to the\ntotal galaxy mass, as traced by the H band luminosity) vs. the angular distance from the cluster\ncenter and vs. the HI-deficiency parameter. Both figures show an interesting trend of decreasing\ndust content with decreasing clustercentric distance and with increasing HI-deficiency, that could\nsuggest dust removal in gas stripped galaxies. The reader should however take this result with some\ncaution because it might be biased by a possible dust mass vs. morphology relation, an effect that\nremains to be confirmed when more far-IR data will be available, in particular of early-type spirals.\nA safer test is shown in Fig. 6 where the 100 to 170 \u03bcm flux density ratio (which gives a model\n\u22126\n, for a \u03b2\nindependent dust temperature, thus is a tracer of the dust mass because Mdust \u03b1 Tdust\nemissivity parameter equal to 2, Bianchi et al. (1999)) is plotted against the HI-deficiency parameter. The sample has been limited to the massive spirals earlier than Scd. Figure 6 indicates a trend\nof the dust temperature (and thus an inverse trend of the dust mass) with the HI-deficiency, suggesting that the external cold dust might be swept together with the neutral hydrogen in stripped\ngalaxies 5 .\n5\n\nNotice that this trend is opposite to the one between the 60 to 100 \u03bcm flux density ratio and the HI-deficiency\n(decrease of temperature with the deficiency) found by Bicay & Giovanelli (1987)\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nGiven the poor statistics and the aforementioned lack of a reference sample, dust depletion in cluster galaxies requires confirmation. The 60-170 \u03bcm all-sky survey that will be soon carried out by\nthe Japanese satellite ASTRO-F (spring 2006) will help disclosing this issue.\n\n2.5.\n\nThe cosmic rays\n\nThe 1400 MHz (20 cm) radio continuum emission of normal, late-type galaxies is dominated\nby the synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons on magnetic fields. The contribution of thermal\nemission is negligible (\u2264 10 %) in bright disk galaxies (Gioia et al. 1982; Klein 1990), but it can be\nrelevant (up to 60-70%) in BCD galaxies (Klein et al. 1991). The tight relationship between the\nradio continuum and the H\u03b1 emission observed in normal galaxies demonstrates that cosmic-ray\nelectrons are accelerated by the young stellar population, probably in supernova remnants (Lequeux\n1971; Kennicutt 1983a; Gavazzi et al. 1991a).\nGavazzi & Jaffe (1986) in their first systematic comparison of the radio continuum properties\n\nFig. 7.- The relationship between radio continuum (at 1400 MHz) and the far-IR at 60 (left panel)\nand 100 (right panel) \u03bcm emission (normalized to the H band luminosity) for galaxies in the two\nclusters Coma and A1367 (open symbols) and in the \"field\" (filled symbols).\nof late-type galaxies in different density environments concluded that spiral galaxies in the Coma\nand A1367 clusters have their radio continuum emission enhanced by \u223c 5 times with respect to\nisolated objects. This result was confirmed by Andersen & Owen (1995), Rengarajan et al. (1997)\nand Gavazzi & Boselli (1999). A marginal increase in the radio emissivity is observed in Virgo and\nA262, and none in loose clusters such as Cancer (Gavazzi & Boselli 1999).\nGavazzi et al. (1991a) showed that the far-IR radio correlation, shared by late-type galaxies in a\nhuge luminosity interval, is different for cluster and isolated galaxies. The cluster objects have an\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nincreased radio emissivity, at any given far-IR luminosity, with respect to \"field\" objects. This is\nshown in Fig. 7, where the normalized (to H) radio continuum emission at 20 cm is plotted versus\nthe normalized (to H) far-IR (60 and 100 \u03bcm) emission for galaxies in the Coma and A1367 clusters\n(open symbols) and in the \"field\" (filled symbols). A similar increase has been observed at other\nfrequencies (6.3 and 2.8 cm) in some galaxies close to the Virgo center by Niklas et al. (1995).\nThe synchrotron emissivity \u01eb\u03bd is proportional to the density of relativistic electrons ne and to the\nmagnetic field density B as (Rybicki & Lightman 1979):\n\u01eb\u03bd \u221d ne \u00d7 B (1+\u03b7)/2 \u00d7 \u03bd \u2212\u03b1r\n\n(erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 strd\u22121 Hz\u22121 )\n\n(4)\n\nwith typical spectral slope \u03b1r =0.8 (Klein 1990; Gioia et al. 1982). The density of relativistic\nelectrons ne , which are accelerated in supernova remnants, is proportional to the number of young\nstars, thus to the ongoing star formation rate. Since both the current star formation activity and\nthe far-IR emission of cluster galaxies are comparable to, or lower than those of isolated objects\n(see Sections 2.4, 2.6), the observed increased radio emissivity and radio to far-IR ratio of cluster\nobjects implies a factor of \u223c 2-3 increase of the magnetic field density, possibly due to compression\n(Gavazzi & Boselli 1999) or most likely due to shock induced re-acceleration of relativistic electrons,\nas proposed by V\u00f6lk & Xu (1994).\n\n2.6.\n\nThe star formation activity\n\nThe current star formation activity of galaxies can be studied using both direct and indirect\ntracers6 . Any luminosity tracer of the young stellar population can be translated into a star formation rate (in M\u2299 yrs\u22121 ) using stellar population synthesis models, provided that the star formation\nactivity is constant over a time scale similar to the age of the emitting population. The H\u03b1 emission\nof a galaxy is due to the hydrogen ionized in HII regions by massive (> 8 M\u2299), young (< 4 106 yrs)\nOB stars (Kennicutt 1998). Once corrected for dust extinction (i.e. using the Balmer decrement),\nthe H\u03b1 luminosity is the most direct star formation tracer in normal galaxies. The UV luminosity\nis also a good tracer of young stars: at 2000 \u00c5, for instance, the emission of late-type galaxies is\ndue to relatively young and massive (2-5 M\u2299) A stars (Boselli et al. 2001). The UV luminosity\nis proportional to the star formation rate provided that the star formation is constant over time\nscales of the order of 3 108 yrs, which generally holds true in unperturbed disks. UV fluxes must\nhowever be corrected for dust extinction, using for example the method proposed by Buat et al.\n(2002), Boselli et al. (2003a) or Cortese et al. (2005a) based on the Far-IR to UV flux ratio.\nThe first attempt to study the star formation properties of galaxies in nearby clusters was carried\nout by Kennicutt (1983b). By comparing the H\u03b1 equivalent width of 26 Virgo galaxies with that\n6\n\nIndirect tracers of the star formation rate, such as the far-IR and radio continuum luminosities, should be used\nwith caution for cluster galaxies because, as discussed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, these quantities might not be reliable\nindicators of the star formation activity, due to dust removal or magnetic field compression\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nof isolated objects of similar Hubble type he showed that Virgo cluster galaxies have, on average, a\nlower star formation activity, redder colors and a lower HI gas content than their \"field\" counterparts. This pattern is fully confirmed by Gavazzi et al. (2002b) and more recently by Gavazzi et al.\n(2005a) who extended the H\u03b1 imaging survey of galaxies in Virgo, Coma and A1367 to 545 cluster\nmembers, 95% complete at mpg \u2264 18.0 in Virgo and at mpg \u2264 15.7 in Coma. Their analysis showed\nthat the current, massive star-formation rate per unit mass increases along the Hubble sequence\nfrom Sa to Scd, it decreases to a relative minimum for Im and it reaches the highest value for BCDs\n(see Figure 8). Within each Hubble type class, galaxies with normal HI content (HI \u2212 def < 0.4)\nhave H\u03b1 E.W. 7 systematically higher than their HI deficient (HI \u2212 def > 0.4) counterparts by a\nfactor of two. Moreover the relative minimum found for Im galaxies is not due to a particularly\nhigh HI deficiency among these objects, but is a characteristic of objects in this Hubble class.\nBoth the SFR per unit mass and the birthrate parameter b, defined as the ratio between the present\n7\n\nWhen we refer to H\u03b1 E.W. we mean H\u03b1+[NII] E.W., since measurements are affected by the contamination of\nthe [NII] lines bracketing H\u03b1.\n\nFig. 8.- The distribution of the individual H\u03b1 E.W. measurements in the Virgo cluster along the\nHubble sequence (small dots) and of the median H\u03b1 E.W. in bins of Hubble type.

This\nindicates that the present day star formation activity of cluster galaxies is regulated by the total\n(HI plus H2 ) gas content, despite the fact that most of the total gas is located outside the optical\nstar forming disks. The role of the molecular gas phase is thus probably dominant only on small\nscales (Boselli et al. 2001).\nMixed with the massive, passively evolving galaxies, however, there exist a population of low-mass\ncluster objects (Gavazzi et al. 1991a, 1998) with a surprisingly high fraction of actively star forming\ngalaxies showing vigorous star formation activity, comparable to that of isolated galaxies, or even\nboosted by the dynamical interaction with the IGM (as in the case of CGCG 97073 and 97079\nin A1367; see sect. 4.10.2) or by tidal interactions with nearby companions (as the Blue Infalling\nGroup (BIG) in A1367; see sect. 4.10.3).\nBeside the global star formation activity, the morphology of the star formation regions of galaxies\nin clusters has been studied in some details (Moss & Whittle 2000; Koopmann & Kenney 1998,\n2004a,b; Knapen 2005), leading however to controversial results that derive from the intrinsic difficulty of classifying the (irregular and seeing dependent) H\u03b1 morphology. One aspect is to find\nwhether cluster disks show a truncation of the H\u03b1 emission in their outer profiles, as expected in\nthe ram-pressure scenario, or if significant star formation excess takes place in the circumnuclear\nregions, as expected if nuclear sinking of gas occurs due to tidal processes, including harassment\n(see Section 4) 8 . Using an objective-prism survey of 320 galaxies in 8 nearby clusters, Moss et al.\n(1998) and Moss & Whittle (2000)) found an excess of galaxies with circumnuclear H\u03b1 emission,\nshowing perturbed or peculiar H\u03b1 morphologies. Their frequency increases with the local (and central) galaxy density, suggesting that they are produced by tidal (galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-cluster)\ninteractions. We notice however that, because of the poor spatial resolution of their objective-prism\ndata (4 kpc), what Moss et al. (1998) and Moss & Whittle (2000) attribute to circumnuclear H\u03b1\nemission corresponds in fact to a truncated disk.\nKoopmann & Kenney (1998, 2004a,b); Koopmann et al. (2006), in their H\u03b1 imaging survey of 55\nVirgo cluster galaxies, found that a severe reduction of the star formation activity takes place only\nin the outer disks, producing truncated H\u03b1 profiles, with normal or possibly enhanced activity in\nthe inner disks. To illustrate this point we show in Figure 9 two galaxies: the normal VCC 92\n(NGC 4192) (left) and the HI deficient, anemic, nucleated VCC 1690 (NGC 4569). On top of the\ncontinuum r band frames, contours of the HI column density are sketched (adapted from Cayatte\net al. (1990)). In spite of their different gas deficiency, vigorous star formation takes place up to\nthe HI radius. Among the deficient objects the H\u03b1 morphology is always that of a truncated disk.\nOnce the gas is radially removed (outside-in) by interactions of any kind, a radial truncation of the\n8\n\nWe remind however that ram pressure can induce an increase of the inner disk gas column density up to a factor\nof \u223c 1.5 in galaxies moving edge-on close to the cluster center (\u223c 100 kpc; Vollmer et al. (2001b)), or the formation\nof an inner gas ring (Schulz & Struck 2001). The increase of the gas column density might induce an inner disk star\nformation and feed a nuclear activity (Schulz & Struck 2001)\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- r band continuum images (upper panel) with superposed HI isophotal contours adapted\nfrom Cayatte et al.

(1980), and predicted by the\nchemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution of Boissier & Prantzos (2000).

The continuum line gives the radial profiles predicted by models after a 400\nMyr old gas stripping event. Strong truncation occurs to the gas and to the H\u03b1, mild to the FUV\nand none to the i band. (adapted from Boselli et al. (2005b))\ntruncation of the star formation activity is in fact dictated by the Schmidt law, as the decrease\nof the total gas column density produces an instantaneous decrease of the star formation activity.\nMulti zone chemo-spectrophotometric models show a clean dependence of the disk truncation on\nwavelength, given that, depending on their age, different stellar populations contribute more to different wavelengths. By comparing model predictions with observed multifrequency radial profiles it\nis thus possible to date the stripping process. In the case of the anemic, HI-deficient Virgo cluster\ngalaxy NGC 4569 (see Fig. 10) Boselli et al. (2005b) were able to reproduce the truncation of the\ntotal gas, of the star forming disk and of the various stellar populations assuming a ram-pressure\nstripping event that took place \u223c 400 Myr ago. Gas stripping in cluster galaxies with truncated HI\nand H\u03b1 disks but unperturbed stellar disks at long wavelengths (\u03bb \u2265 6000 \u00c5) is thus a relatively\nrecent event (some 108 yr), indicating that the perturbing interaction took place close to the cluster\ncenter (this time scale is in fact \u223c 5 times smaller than the cluster crossing time).\nStatistical evidence for a definite increasing trend of the ratio of the optical to H\u03b1 radius (\"trun-\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- The ratio of the optical to H\u03b1 radius versus the HI deficiency of late-type galaxies in the\nVirgo cluster.

(2006, in\npreparation) in their recent analysis of the complete H\u03b1 survey of disk galaxies in the Virgo cluster.\nAnother important issue is that the amount and the scale over which the current star formation\nrate is found quenched in nearby clusters of galaxies seems to depend significantly on luminosity.\nFor the Virgo cluster the H\u03b1 data-set analyzed by Gavazzi et al. (2005a) is 95% complete at mpg\n\u2264 18.0 (Mpg \u2264 -13.0) over the area covered by the VCC, i.e. up to approximately 2.5 virial radii\nfrom M87. Similar completeness (95%) at mpg \u2264 15.7 (Mpg \u2264 -19.0) is reached in Coma, but over\na much larger area of the Great Wall, including the bridge between Coma and A1367.\nIn bright spiral galaxies 9 the star formation rate per unit mass decreases from \u223c 20 \u2212 30\u00c5 found\nat approximately 2 virial radii projected distance from Coma and Virgo, inward (see open circles\nin Fig.12) to virtually zero at the cluster center. An even more conspicuous decrease is observed in\nthe redshift range 0.05< z <0.095 by Gomez et al. (2003) using a sample of \u223c 8500 galaxies from\nthe SDSS, and by Lewis et al. (2002) on \u223c 11000 galaxies from the 2dF. These surveys have shown\n9\n\nWe use two slightly different thresholds to discriminate bright from faint in Virgo and Coma. In Virgo we use\nthe optical limit Mpg \u2264 -19.0 and in Coma the Near-Infrared limit LH = 10.5\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- The clustercentric radial distribution of the individual H\u03b1 E.W. measurements in the\nVirgo cluster (right) and in the Coma+A1367 clusters (left).

However,\nthey are limited by the absence of reliable morphology indicators for the bulk of their objects (the\nmorphological classification based only on light concentration and/or spectrophotometric parameters has been proved to be highly inaccurate (Scodeggio et al. 2002b)). They suffer from the\ndifficulty of disentangling the radial dependence of the star formation activity in spiral galaxies\nfrom the morphology segregation effect itself.\nWhat we found most surprising in Virgo and Coma is that galaxies less luminous than some threshold have their star formation rate per unit mass independent on the clustercentric radius (see the\nfilled circles in Fig.12). This pattern could not be found neither in the SDSS nor in the 2dF because\nthese surveys do not include such low luminosity objects. The sample of nearby clusters used by\nGomez et al. (2003), for instance, is limited to Mr \u2264 -20.5, while that of Lewis et al. (2002) to Mb\n\u2264 -19.\nThe analysis of 60 clusters at z < 0.11 in the 2dF by De Propris et al. (2004) showed that the\nfraction of blue galaxies depends on the luminosity, clustercentric distance and galaxy density,\nbut is insensitive to the Bautz-Morgan type, the velocity dispersion (mass), richness, presence of\nsubstructures and cluster concentration. Similarly, the 2dF analysis by Bower & Balogh (2004)\nshows that significant quenching of the SFR occurs above the local galaxy density threshold of \u223c\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\u22122\n1-2 h\u22122\n75 Mpc , but is insensitive to the radial clustercentric distance and to the velocity dispersion. These evidences indicate that significant suppression of the SFR takes place in the group\nenvironment, where tidal mechanisms, as opposed to ram pressure, are likely to take place. Summarizing, the present star formation rate in late-type cluster galaxies is significantly more quiescent\nthan in their \"field\" counterparts and it is found to depend primarily on the residual HI content.\nThe hydrodynamic interaction with the hot IGM is certainly responsible of significant HI ablation\nat the present cosmological epoch, thereby producing radial truncation in the birth of new stars,\nhowever tidal processes might have been dominant at suppressing the star formation during earlier\npreprocessing phases.\n\n3.\n\nOther observational characteristics of cluster galaxies\n3.1.\n\nMorphology segregation\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, morphology segregation is at present the strongest observational signature of a different nature or nurture of cluster galaxies. In his seminal work based on\nphotographic plates of 55 nearby clusters including \u223c 6000 galaxies Dressler (1980) showed that the\nfraction of early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) increases with the galaxy density and/or\nclustercentric radius (Whitmore et al. 1993). This relation appears universal, as it holds over 6\norders of magnitude, from rich clusters to loose groups (Postman & Geller 1984). Whitmore et al.\n(1993) claim that the morphology-radius relation is independent of the number density within the\ncentral 0.5 Mpc, of the X-ray luminosity or of the velocity dispersion of the cluster. The fraction\nof ellipticals in the outer parts of clusters is \u223c constant (10 to 16 %) at a distance > 0.5 Mpc. This\nfraction increases to 60-70% in the cluster center. The fraction of lenticulars rises moderately up\nto the central 0.2 Mpc, then it drops sharply. On the other hand the fraction of spirals decreases\ncontinuously from the outskirts (\u223c 60%) to the cluster center, where it drops to virtually 0%.\nFurthermore, in the Coma cluster, the fraction of barred galaxies increases toward the cluster core\n(Thompson 1981).\nBinggeli et al. (1990), Thuan et al. (1991) and Sabatini et al. (2005) showed that segregation also\naffects dwarf galaxies, i.e. dwarf ellipticals are more frequent in dense environments while dwarf\nirregulars are ubiquitous.\nVogt et al. (2004) showed that the spiral fraction depends inversely on the cluster X-ray temperature. They also found that, while the fraction of ellipticals is almost constant (\u223c 15 % regardless of\nthe X-ray temperature or spiral fraction), there is a strong inverse correlation between the fraction\nof spirals and S0s constituting the remaining 85%, in other words the increase of the spiral fraction\nin the clusters outskirts compensates for the decrease of lenticulars. This effect holds in clusters of\ndifferent richness, and extends beyond the virial radius. Both early- and late-type spirals are found\nin an envelope surrounding the cluster core, at a mean distance of 1.5 h\u22121 Mpc, while ellipticals are\nat \u223c 0.85 h\u22121 Mpc. Note that the morphology-density relation also affects distant (z=0.5), rich,\ncentrally-concentrated clusters, while it seems to avoid irregular ones (Dressler et al. 1997). In\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ndistant clusters the spiral fraction is larger, the elliptical fraction is \u2265 and the lenticular fraction is\na factor of \u223c 2-3 smaller than in nearby clusters (Dressler et al. 1997; Fasano et al. 2000).\nAs mentioned in the introduction, morphology segregation is self-evident in the Coma cluster. Andreon (1996) showed however that, while spirals are homogeneously distributed over the cluster,\nthe early-type component concentrates along the direction marked by the supercluster structure.\nFurthermore he showed evidence for velocity segregation, with ellipticals and lenticulars having\nsignificantly smaller dispersion (\u223c 700 km s\u22121 ) than spirals (\u223c 1300 km s\u22121 ) (see also Section 3.4).\nMore recently Kashikawa et al. (1998), by analyzing CCD images covering more than 5 square\ndegree of the Coma cluster, showed a strong luminosity segregation in the magnitude range -20 \u2264\nMR \u2264 -16. Galaxies with high central light concentration have a clustering strength significantly\ndependent on luminosity, while objects with a low central concentration show almost no luminosity segregation. Once again we remind that interpreting this evidence in terms of morphology is\nnot straightforward since, as mentioned earlier, galaxy light profiles better correlate in shape with\nluminosity than with morphological type: both dE and low-luminosity late-type have exponential\nlight profiles with low concentration indices (Gavazzi et al. 2000b).\nThe study of the galaxy morphology distribution in the Virgo cluster is made complex by projection\neffects due to the elongated 3-D structure of the cluster (see Section 3.4). Schindler et al. (1999)\ncompared the distribution of galaxies cataloged in the VCC with that of the X-ray emitting gas\nfrom the ROSAT All Sky Survey, and found that the two components have a similar distributions.\nThe cluster can be decomposed in three major substructures centered on M87, M49 and M86. They\nfound no luminosity segregation and positive morphology segregation: spirals are more spread than\nearly-types, while nucleated dwarf ellipticals are more concentrated toward the cluster center than\ntheir non-nucleated counterparts (see also Binggeli et al. (1987)).\nThe SDSS and 2dF surveys made it possible to extend the study of morphology segregation to regions of low density contrast with respect to the \"field\". They confirm the increase of the fraction\nof the red, bulge-dominated galaxies with galaxy density and cluster-centric distance (Goto et al.\n2003b; Hogg et al. 2003; Balogh et al. 2004; De Propris et al. 2004) that was known in rich nearby\nclusters.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe luminosity function\n\nThe determination of the luminosity function (LF) in distinct morphological classes (elliptical\nvs. spirals) is a difficult task both for the clusters and for the \"field\" because of the lack of high\nquality imaging material that is necessary for an accurate morphological classification. Let us then\nstart reviewing the most recent determinations of the global (elliptical + spirals) LF, as derived\nfrom the extensive spectroscopic and imaging surveys carried on in the optical in the nearby Uni-\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nverse (POSS, SDSS, 2dF)10 . Paolillo et al. (2001), by combining POSS-II data of 39 nearby Abell\nclusters, determined that the composite cluster luminosity function in the high-luminosity range\n(-22 \u2264 MR \u2264 -18.5) has a Schechter parameter \u03b1 \u223c -1.1 \u00b1 0.2, both at red and blue wavelengths.\nAt fainter magnitudes, however, the slope becomes significantly steeper. Yagi et al. (2002), using\nR band CCD images of 10 nearby (z \u2264 0.076) clusters, determined that the composite luminosity\nfunction in the range -23.5 \u2264 MR \u2264 -16 has a slope \u03b1(R) \u223c -1.31. More recently, using the 2dF\nredshift survey of 60 nearby clusters (z \u2264 0.11), De Propris et al. (2003) constructed a composite\nluminosity function in the bJ band. In the magnitude range -22.5 \u2264 MbJ \u2264 -15 they derive a\nslope \u03b1(bJ ) = -1.28. These works indicate that the slope of the faint end of the optical luminosity\nfunction is steeper in clusters (\u03b1 \u223c -1.3) than in the \"field\" (\u03b1 \u223c -1.2; Blanton et al. (2001)). A\nsteeper slope (\u03b1(R) \u223c -1.6) in the magnitude range -17 \u2264 MR \u2264 -14 was found by Trentham et al.\n(2005), indicating that the steepening of the cluster luminosity function is due to the dwarf galaxy\npopulation.\nDe Propris et al. (2003) also showed that the cluster luminosity function has a characteristic magnitude Mb\u2217J 0.3 mag. brighter than the \"field\" one, that they tentatively attribute to an excess of very\nbright galaxies in the cluster cores. Furthermore the luminosity function is similar in clusters with\nhigh and low velocity dispersions, of different type and richness, with or without substructures. It\nwas however noticed that the cluster luminosity function has a dip at MR \u223c -18.5 mostly due to\nthe early-type component, whose presence generally correlates with the cluster velocity dispersion\n(Yagi et al. 2002).\nIn their effort to disentangle the contribution of early- and late-type galaxies to the LF, by dividing galaxies according to the shape of their radial light profiles, Yagi et al. (2002) showed that\nthe composite cluster luminosity function of exponential disks has a faint end slope \u03b1(R) = -1.49,\nsignificantly steeper than that of galaxies characterized by r 1/4 light profiles (\u03b1(R) = -1.08). The\ninterpretation of this finding in terms of morphology is however uncertain because it is well known\nthat both early- and late-type low-luminosity systems are characterized by exponential disks, and\nboth early- and late-type high luminosity, bulge dominated systems have \u223c r 1/4 light profiles\n(Gavazzi et al. 2000b).\nUsing a spectral classification similar to the one used for the \"field\" by Madgwick et al. (2002), De\nPropris et al. (2003) showed that the luminosity function of cluster galaxies with early-type-like\nspectra is brighter and steeper than in the \"field\", while that of objects with late-type-like spectra\nis similar. This suggests that the observed steepening of the cluster luminosity function is due to\nthe early-type component. Once again, however one should use some caution since Gavazzi et al.\n(2004) showed that many bright cluster, late-type galaxies have spectra similar to ellipticals. These\nare systems devoid of gas with no star formation activity.\n10\n\nFor characterizing the luminosity function we will use in the following the Schechter (1976) formalism:\n\u03c6(L)dL = \u03c6\u2217 (\n\nL \u03b1 \u2212( LL\u2217 ) L\n) e\nd( \u2217 )\nL\u2217\nL\n\n(5)\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nFor galaxies in the Virgo cluster, due to its proximity (17 Mpc), both the cluster membership, based\non surface brightness criteria, and the morphological type separation are very accurate, even for\nthe dwarf component. The B band LF, determined with high precision by Sandage et al. (1985),\ncan be summarized as follows: the global LF has a faint end slope \u03b1(B)=-1.4 up to MB \u2264 -13,\nand even steeper at lower luminosities (\u03b1(B)=-1.6 up to MB \u2264 -11; Trentham & Hodgkin (2002)).\nAlthough Virgo is a spiral rich cluster, the steep rise of the luminosity function is primarily do to\nthe dwarf elliptical component, which appears flatter in the \"field\" (Binggeli et al. 1990).\nThe spirals (Sa-Sm) follow a Gaussian, peaked at MB =-17.7, but when the fainter Im are added,\nwhich follow a Schechter function of slope \u03b1(B)=-0.25, the combined late-type (Spiral + Im) galaxies have a slope \u03b1(B)=-0.80.\nA similarly accurate type separation is not yet achieved in the \"field\" because of the poorer morphological classification. Using a spectroscopic type classification, Madgwick et al. (2002) obtained\nslopes \u03b1(bJ ) = -0.99, -1.24, -1.50 for early-spirals, late-spirals and irregulars respectively. Consistent values are obtained by Heyl et al. (1997) with similar techniques (\u03b1(bJ ) =-0.99, -1.25, -1.37,\n-1.36 for Sab, Sbc, Scd, Sdm/Starburst respectively). Marzke et al. (1998), using a morphological\nclassification based on plate material for 5404 galaxies, determined a type-dependent luminosity\nfunction of slope \u03b1(B) =-1.11 for spirals and \u03b1(B) =-1.81 for peculiars and irregulars. Despite the\nlarge uncertainty affecting these determination, it appears that, at least at optical wavelengths, the\nslope of the late-type galaxies luminosity function of Virgo is significantly flatter than that of the\n\"field\".\nFor nearby clusters such as Coma, A1367 and Virgo it is possible to derive separate determinations\nof the LF, each for every frequency band relevant to the stellar emission, from H\u03b1 and UV to\nnear-IR. The comparison with the \"field\" is however possible only for the global (all types) LFs.\nIn the spiral poor, relatively relaxed Coma cluster the slope \u03b1 (in the visible) listed in the literature\nranges between \u223c -1.7 and \u223c -1.2, depending on the absolute magnitude range and on the cluster\nregion included (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. 2003). The slope \u03b1 and the difference between the slope\nof the luminosity function in the \"field\" and in clusters are wavelength dependent, as shown in\nFig. 13. While at \u03bb > 2000 \u00c5 the slope of the Coma luminosity function is increasingly (with \u03bb)\nsteeper than that in the \"field\", for \u03bb> 1500 \u00c5 the reverse is true. At long wavelengths (near-IR)\nthe luminosity is a tracer of the dynamical mass (Gavazzi et al. 1996), thus the luminosity function\ncan be assumed as a mass function. Even though significantly steeper than in the \"field\" at near-IR,\nthe cluster luminosity function (\u03b1 \u223c -1.5; de Propris et al. (1998); Mobasher & Trentham (1998),\nAndreon & Pell\u00f3 (2000), Balogh et al. (2001)) is still significantly flatter than the one predicted\nby CDM semi-analytical hierarchical models of galaxy formation (Somerville & Primack 1999). In\nany cosmology, CDM models predict slopes \u03b1 \u223c - 2 for the mass function. Assuming a mass to\nlight ratio in agreement with the Tully-Fisher relation, it is at present impossible to obtain from\nthese models the observed slope of the near-IR LF.\nAt wavelengths shorter than \u2264 2500 \u00c5, where the emission of galaxies is dominated by the star\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- The wavelength dependence of the slope of the luminosity function for cluster and\nisolated galaxies (upper panel) and of the difference between \u03b1 in Coma and in the \"field\" (lower\npanel).

(1995)\nin the H\u03b1, Treyer (private communication) in the UV at 2000 \u00c5 and Wyder et al. (2005) in the\nUV GALEX bands. In the K band we averaged Cole et al. (2001) with Huang et al. (2003) and\nKochanek et al. (2001)).\nformation activity\n11\n\n11\n\nthe luminosity function is representative of the late-type galaxy population.\n\nIn elliptical galaxies the (faint) UV emission is not due to star formation, but to extreme Horizontal Branch\nstars and their progeny (O'Connell 1999): their contribution to the faint end slope of the UV luminosity function is\nsignificant because of the large number of E contributing at low luminosity (Cortese et al. 2003, 2005b)\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nIglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. (2002) constructed the first H\u03b1 luminosity function of cluster galaxies using a\ndeep, wide field H\u03b1 imaging survey of Coma and A1367 and compared it to that of Virgo. Despite\ntheir different nature (Coma is relaxed, spiral poor, A1367 relaxed spiral rich and Virgo unrelaxed\nspiral rich), the three clusters have a similar H\u03b1 luminosity function with slope \u03b1(H\u03b1) = -0.70\n\u00b1 0.10. In the bright luminosity range this slope is similar to that of the \"field\" determined by\nGallego et al. (1995). At fainter luminosities it is significantly flatter than the poorly constrained\n(\u03b1(H\u03b1) \u223c -1.3) found by Gallego et al. (1995).\nThe composite cluster UV luminosity function, obtained by combining balloon borne 1650-2000\n\u00c5 data of Coma, A1367 and Virgo, has a slope \u03b1(U V ) =-1.50 \u00b1 0.10 (Cortese et al. 2003), consistent with the \"field\" one (\u03b1(U V ) =-1.51, Sullivan et al. (2000)). More recent results based on\nhigher quality and deeper GALEX UV data of A1367 give a slope of the UV luminosity function\n(\u03b1(U V 2310\u00c5)=-1.64\u00b10.21; \u03b1(U V 1530\u00c5)=-1.56\u00b10.19; Cortese et al. (2005b)) significantly steeper\nthan in the \"field\" (\u03b1(U V 2310\u00c5)=-1.16\u00b10.07; \u03b1(U V 1530\u00c5)=-1.22\u00b10.07; Wyder et al. (2005)). If\nlimited to star forming galaxies, however, the cluster and \"field\" luminosity functions are similar\n(Cortese et al. 2005b).\nWe conclude that the cluster luminosity function is increasingly steeper than that in the \"field\"\nfor \u03bb \u2265 1500 \u00c5, and it is flatter for the ionizing radiation < 912 \u00c5. The steepening of the cluster\nluminosity function with increasing \u03bb is due to the increasing contribution of E-dEs toward longer\nwavelengths. The weight of E-dEs in the luminosity function is already significant in the UV bands\nwhile it vanishes only for \u03bb < 912 \u00c5.\n\n3.3.\n\nGalactic kinematic disturbances\n\nThe presence of kinematic disturbances in late-type galaxies in clusters is controversial. Based\non the analysis of long slit spectra, Rubin et al. (1988) and Whitmore et al. (1988) showed that\nthe rotation curve of cluster galaxies strongly decline at outer radii, in particular in those galaxies\nlocated close to the cluster center, in contrast with the asymptotically flat or rising rotation curve\nof isolated objects. They also showed that most of the declining rotation curves are associated with\nHI-deficient galaxies (Rubin et al. 1988). This evidence was at that time interpreted as the result\nof stripping of the dark matter halo surrounding galaxies during galaxy-galaxy and/or galaxy-IGM\ninteraction, or as the prevention of halo formation in the cluster environment (Whitmore et al.\n1988).\nThis result was however questioned by Amram et al. (1993) who analyzed more accurate 2-D\nvelocity fields of 21 cluster galaxies obtained with a Fabry-Perot spectrograph, finding flat (or\nsmoothly declining) rotation curves.\nMore recently Rubin et al. (1999), in their analysis of long-slit rotation curves of 89 spiral galaxies\nin the Virgo cluster, reiterated that approximately one half of the Virgo galaxies show kinematic\ndisturbances in their rotation curve (asymmetrical rotational velocities on the two sides of the\nmajor axis, falling outer velocities, inner velocity peculiarities, dips in the rotation velocities at\nintermediate radii, velocities near zero for the near nuclear gas). These disturbances are consistent\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nwith recent (\u2264 1 Gyr, the time necessary to re-distribute the mass within the disks in a few rotation\ncycles) tidal encounters or accretion events (see also Barton et al. (1999)). Disturbances are not\ncorrelated with Hubble type, luminosity, local galaxy density or HI deficiency. The authors claim\nthat galaxies with perturbed rotation curves have a Gaussian velocity distribution peaked at the\naverage cluster velocity, but they are often located at the cluster periphery, possibly on radial\norbits.\nUsing a sample of 510 cluster galaxies with long slit spectroscopy, Dale et al. (2001) recently\ncriticized this result. They maintained that the residual of the Tully-Fisher relation does not\ndepend on the location of galaxies within clusters. They only observed that the rotation curve of\ngalaxies in the periphery are more extended than in the galaxies close to the cluster core, consistent\nwith their H\u03b1 morphology. By analyzing the H\u03b1 rotation curves of late-type galaxies in nearby\nclusters Vogt et al. (2004); Chemin et al. (2005) came to the similar conclusion that the distribution\nof HII regions along spiral disks is often truncated or asymmetric or perturbed. Asymmetric spirals\nare not observed beyond 1 h\u22121 Mpc, and are found predominantly in the richest cluster cores. We\nconclude that, if any, mild differences exist between the kinematic properties of cluster and \"field\"\ngalaxies.\n\n3.4.\n\nLarge scale velocity distributions, evidences for infall?\n\nIt is well known that the velocity distribution of cluster galaxies is type-dependent: while that\nof the early-type component is virialized, the one of late-types hardly follows a Gaussian distribution, being skewed toward highly deviating velocities (Biviano et al. 1997), probably because of\ntheir more elongated radial orbits, with higher elongations in late, star forming than in early-spirals\n(Biviano & Katgert 2004). By itself this provides an evidence for infall of late-type galaxies onto\nclusters (see e.g. Colless & Dunn (1996); Rines et al. (2003)).\nUsing the updated redshifts of Virgo (taken from GOLDmine) and new redshift determinations\n(Cortese et al. 2004) of galaxies in the central 1 deg regions of Coma and A1367 surveyed by\nIglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. (2002, 2003) in the H\u03b1 and r \u2032 band down to faint (r \u2032 < 21) magnitudes, we\nplot in Fig. 14 the velocity distributions of galaxies in these three clusters. For Virgo we divide\nearly- from late-type galaxies according to the morphological classification given in the VCC. For\nComa and A1367, where no such a reliable classification exists at this faint level, we use the H\u03b1\nline to discriminate between star forming and non star forming galaxies. It is apparent from the\nfigure that in the three clusters the velocity distribution of the early type objects is Gaussian:\n< V >A1367 = 6347 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VA1367 = 760 km s\u22121 , < V >Coma = 6994 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VComa = 1149 km\ns\u22121 , < V >V irgo = 1202 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VV irgo = 753 km s\u22121 , while that of the late-type component is\nnon-Gaussian, generally broader and with a significantly larger mean redshift. For this component\na realistic estimate of the velocity dispersion is the one derived from the difference between the 25\nand 75 percentiles of the redshift distribution: < V >A1367 = 7080 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VA1367 =1415 km s\u22121 ,\n< V >Coma = 7796 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VComa = 1560 km s\u22121 , < V >V irgo = 1340 km s\u22121 ; \u03b4VV irgo =1150 km\ns\u22121 . A consistent result for Virgo was obtained by Binggeli et al. (1987, 1993) and by Conselice\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- The velocity distribution of galaxies in the A1367, Coma and Virgo clusters, divided in\nearly (left) and late-types (right).\net al. (2001) who also noticed that the velocity distribution of dE galaxies resembles more that of\nlate-type galaxies than of Es. Similarly Colless & Dunn (1996) (see also Andreon (1996)) showed\n\u221a\nthat the velocity dispersion of the late-type galaxies in the Coma cluster is \u223c 2 that of the early\ntype component, suggesting that spirals are free falling into the cluster core.\nA direct proof of infall would require the knowledge of the galaxies trajectories in 3-D. Unfortunately\nthe velocity component perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be measured, but, combining the\nline-of-sight component of the redshift with some independent distance estimate (e.g. from the\nTully-Fisher or fundamental plane relation), the peculiar motions can be reconstructed (Tully &\nShaya 1984)). Using these methods peculiar galaxy motions (up to 2000 km s\u22121 ), induced by the\ncluster potential well, have been detected in several nearby clusters such as Virgo (Tully & Shaya\n1984; Gavazzi et al. 1991b, 1999) and Coma (Gavazzi et al. 1991b).\nThe Coma cluster has been considered for a long time as the prototype of old, relaxed clusters.\nX-ray observations and dynamical studies (White et al. 1993; Colless & Dunn 1996; Briel et al.\n2001), showed however that the structure of the cluster is formed by a massive main body centered\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\non the 2 cD galaxies NGC 4874 and 4889, and a less massive substructure centered on NGC 4839\ninfalling onto the main cluster. It is still unclear whether the NGC 4839 subgroup already crossed\nthe cluster core or it is falling into it for the first time (Colless & Dunn 1996). The interaction\nbetween this substructure and the main cluster is probably the driver of the PSB galaxies observed\nby Caldwell et al. (1993) and Poggianti et al. (2004) (discussed in Section 3.5).\nThe dynamical study of A1367 (Cortese et al. 2004) revealed the presence of a relatively compact\ngroup with low velocity dispersion (\u223c 170 km s\u22121 ) and composed of highly perturbed, star forming\nobjects, falling into the main cluster at \u223c 1700 km s\u22121 (see Sect. 4.10.3). There is also evidence of\nindividual galaxies falling onto nearby clusters, such as CGCG 97-073 and CGCG 97-079 in A1367\n(see sect. 4.10).\nBecause of its smaller distance (17 Mpc) and of its depth along the line of sight, the distance determination of galaxies within the Virgo cluster using the Tully-Fisher and the fundamental plane\nrelation is sufficiently accurate to disentangle the 3-D structure of the cluster (Tully & Shaya 1984);\ndirectly proving the presence of infalling galaxies. Gavazzi et al. (1999) found that the distance of\ncluster A (\u03bco = 30.78 \u00b1 0.07), associated with M87, is consistent with the determination based on\nthe Cepheid's method (\u03bco =31.0). Cluster B, off-set to the south, is found at \u03bco = 31.76 \u00b1 0.09.\nThis subcluster is falling onto A at about 500 km s\u22121 . Clouds W and M are at twice the distance\nof A. Their recessional velocity indicates that these clouds are in Hubble flow, thus little perturbed\nby the presence of Virgo. Galaxies on the North-West and South-East of the main cluster A belong\nto two clouds composed almost exclusively of spiral galaxies with distances consistent with A, but\nwith significantly different velocity distributions, suggesting that they are falling onto cluster A at\napproximately 500 km s\u22121 from the far and near-side respectively. Moreover a significant fraction of\ngas \"healthy\" and currently star forming galaxies is unexpectedly found projected near the center\nof the Virgo cluster. Their average Tully-Fisher distance is found approximately one magnitude\nfurther away (\u03bco =31.77) than that of their gas-deficient counterparts (\u03bco =30.85). It is suggested\nthat these gas healthy objects belong to a cloud that in fact lies a few Mpc behind Virgo, in the\nprocess of falling toward the Virgo cluster (Gavazzi et al. 2002b; Solanes et al. 2002). The velocity\ndispersion of each individual substructure is \u223c 500 km s\u22121 (Binggeli et al. 1993; Gavazzi et al.\n1999), resembling that of a formed cluster rather than a group.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Spiral - S0 connection\n\nWhen Van den Bergh discussed his morphology classification system, he pointed out the existence of \"anemic\" galaxies that might represent the missing link between normal spirals and\nlenticulars. They are characterized by an arm-interarm contrast less pronounced than normal spirals, they are gas-poor, with low star formation activity, redder colors than normal spirals with\nsimilar bulge to disk ratios. Their fraction is significantly larger in clusters such as Virgo than in the\n\"field\" (van den Bergh 1976). The \"passive\" spirals also inhabit several SDSS clusters at redshift\n0.05< z < 0.1, but they are preferentially found outside the cluster's cores (Goto et al. 2003a). The\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nfirst interpretation of their existence was that, once the gas reservoir feeding the star formation is\nremoved from cluster spirals, they become lenticulars (van den Bergh 1976). In a detailed analysis\nof the star forming properties of anemic galaxies, Elmegreen et al. (2002) concluded that their gas\nsurface density is below the threshold for the star formation to take place. Because of the lack\nof supply of young stars with low velocity dispersion, the disk heats up, dumping spiral waves on\ntime scales of a few revolutions (Sellwood & Carlberg 1984; Fuchs & von Linden 1998; Elmegreen\net al. 2002). The anemic sequence would thus represent the intermediate phase between spirals\nand S0 (van den Bergh 1976). Koopmann & Kenney (1998) have quantitatively shown that the\nexcess of early-type spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster is partly due to misleading classifications of\nlow-concentration (disk-dominated) systems with reduced star formation activity rather than to a\nsystematic increase of the bulge to disk ratio with galaxy density. They interpreted this result as\nan evidence that these low-concentration early-type spirals were blue, star forming late-type spirals\nwhose activity was quenched by gas removal induced by their interaction with the ICM.\nThere exist, however, several observational evidences indicating that lenticular galaxies in nearby\nclusters are not gas stripped late-type galaxies. Dressler (1980) showed that the bulge size and the\nbulge-to-disk ratio of lenticulars are systematically larger than those of spirals in all density regimes.\nHe thus concluded that \"since the tightly bound inner bulges should be unaffected by ablation, the\ndissimilarity in the bulge and bulge/disk distributions in all density regimes is inconsistent with\nthe idea that most S0 galaxies result from the removal of disk gas from a spiral by ram-pressure\nstripping or evaporation\" (Dressler 1980; Burstein 1979; Gisler 1980).\nWe checked this conclusion using our near-IR survey of the Virgo cluster. These H-band imaging\ndata, beside a better photometric quality due to the linear response of the NICMOS-3 detectors\ncompared to the photographic plates of Dressler (1980), have the advantage of being free from dust\nobscuration and from relatively recent episodes of star formation which might alter the morphological properties of galaxies. The H band Kormendy relation between the effective surface brightness\n\u03bce and the effective radii Re (radii including half of the total light) for lenticulars and spirals of\ntype Sa-Sb in the Virgo cluster is given in Fig. 15. Sa-Sbs have, on average 0.65 mag arcsec\u22122\nlower surface brightness and almost a factor of 2 larger effective radii than lenticulars. This confirms the results of Dressler (1980) and makes the formation of lenticulars through gas sweeping in\nspirals very unlikely. This conclusion was recently confirmed by Christlein & Zabludoff (2004) who\nfound that the bulge to disk ratio increases in cluster galaxies because of the increase of the bulge\nluminosity (as expected in a tidal interaction scenario) and not because of the fading of the disk\nluminosity (as expected in a ICM-IGM interaction).\nSpectroscopic observations of 125 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster revealed the presence\nof a significant number of objects with signs of recent star formation, such as Balmer absorption and\nemission lines and negative CN/H8 indices (Caldwell et al. 1993). The spectroscopic characteristics\nof these galaxies are similar to those of post-starburst galaxies observed in intermediate-redshift\nclusters, the so called E+A galaxies (Caldwell et al. 1993). Interestingly most E+A galaxies were\nfound in the south west periphery of the Coma cluster, probably associated with the NGC 4839\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- The relationship between the H band effective radius and effective surface brightness\nin the Virgo cluster.

Large\nsymbols represents averages.\ngroup, but with a larger velocity dispersion than the remaining early-type galaxies belonging to\nthe same group (Caldwell et al. 1993).\nHST images of some starburst or post-starburst galaxies in the Coma periphery revealed that they\nhave exponential disks, some with an embedded central spiral, whereas kinematic data showed\nrotation curves typical of late-type galaxies (Caldwell et al. 1996, 1999).\nThe analysis of Poggianti et al. (2001a,b) of \u223c 300 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster confirmed most of the Caldwell et al. results. Using several spectral indices in the visible bands, these\nauthors were able to discriminate between age and metallicity effects, and concluded that more\nthan 40% of the low luminosity (MB > -19) S0s in Coma undergone star formation episodes in the\nlast \u223c 5 Gyr, significantly later than elliptical galaxies.\nPoggianti et al. (2004) found that k+a/a+k galaxies (post starburst/post-star forming galaxies with\nno current star formation activity that were forming stars at a vigorous rate in the last 1.5 Gyrs, as\nindicated by their high Balmer absorption lines (H\u03b4E.W. \u2265 5 \u00c5)) in Coma are all low luminosity\nobjects (MV > -18.5), thus significantly different from the high luminosity ones (MV \u2264 -20) observed in high redshift clusters. They have also shown that these post starburst/post-star forming\ngalaxies spatially correlate with substructures in the hot IGM, as revealed by the XMM-Newton\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\ndata, are located in the central \u223c 1.4 Mpc of the cluster and have radial velocities significantly\nhigher than the cluster mean. These evidences were interpreted as an indication that the activity\nof this population of low-luminosity, post-star forming galaxies was quenched (and boosted) by the\ninteraction with the dense ICM (Poggianti et al. 2004).\nHow does the star formation history of early-type (Sa-Sb) spiral galaxies compares with that of\nnormal (non-PSB) S0? To try constraining their star formation histories by fitting the UV to\nnear-IR SEDs with Bruzual & Charlot (1993) stellar population synthesis models (as outlined in\nSection 2.6) Gavazzi et al. (2002a) concluded that S0-S0a have on average slightly smaller \u03c4 s than\nearly-type spirals of similar luminosity, indicating that the bulk of the star formation activity in\nlenticulars is older than in spirals.\nKinematic studies of nearby cluster and \"field\" S0 argue for a different nature of spirals and lenticulars. The larger scatter and a small zero point offset in the Tully-Fisher relation observed in Virgo\nand Coma cluster S0 galaxies compared to spirals indicate that lenticulars can hardly be formed\nby simple gas removal from healthy spirals. On the contrary it is argued that S0s are formed\nduring minor mergers, slow encounters, harassment, or some combination of these, making S0s an\nheterogeneous class of objects (Dressler & Sandage 1983; Neistein et al. 1999; Hinz et al. 2003).\nOther statistical considerations such as the extremely weak dependence of the morphology segregation effect on galaxy density (the fraction of spiral galaxies changes by a factor of \u223c 2 over a change\nof \u223c 1000 in galaxy space density) are hardly explained by a simple transformation of spirals into\nS0 through ram pressure stripping, as noticed by Dressler (1980) and Dressler (2004), but seem\nto indicate that the morphology of galaxies was settled shortly after their birth, before the dense\ncluster environment was even formed.\nIn conclusion, while lenticular and quiescent early-type spirals have nearly indistinguishable stellar\npopulations, significant differences in their structural and kinematic properties as well as statistical\nconsiderations argue against the origin of high mass S0s in nearby clusters from gas removal of spiral disks. On the contrary, low-luminosity disk-dominated S0 might be the result of ram-pressure\nstripping in late-type galaxies.\n\n4.\n\nThe physical processes acting in clusters\n\nThe analysis presented so far has shown that late-type galaxies in nearby clusters differ systematically from their field counterparts mainly in two respects: they are significantly HI-deficient\nand are characterized by a lower activity of star formation, with truncated HI and star forming\ndisks. Other less clearcut differences are their molecular gas content, metallicity, cold dust content,\nkinematical perturbations and radio-continuum synchrotron emission. While in massive spirals the\nHI-deficiency and suppression of the star formation depend on the distance from the cluster center\n(provided that they are within 1-2 virial radii), in dwarf irregulars they depend primarily on the\ngalaxy luminosity and very little on the clustercentric position.\nWhich are the physical processes that produced such differences? Are the physical conditions in\ntoday's high density environments similar to the ones prevailing in the young universe when the\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nTable 1: The adopted parameters of clusters Coma, A1367 and Virgo.\nCluster\nComa\nA1367\nV irgo\n\n<V >\nkm s\u22121\n\n\u03b4Vcluster\nkm s\u22121\n\nref\n\n\u03c1IGM\natom cm\u22123\n\nref\n\nTIGM\nkeV\n\nref\n\nRc\nkpc\n\nref\n\nRvir\nMpc\n\nref\n\nMcluster\nM\u2299\n\nref\n\n6960\n6420\n951\n\n880 (1560)a\n822 (1415)a\n886 (1150)a\n\n1\n1\n4\n\n3.12 10\u22123\n1.25 10\u22123\n2.00 10\u22123\n\n3\n3\n5\n\n8.2\n3.5\n2.3\n\n3\n3\n8\n\n257\n240\n130\n\n3\n3\n5\n\n2.19\n2.13\n1.68\n\n7\n7\n7\n\n1.2 1015\n6.9 1014\n2.5 1014\n\n2\n7\n6\n\nReferences: 1: Struble & Rood (1991); 2: Briel et al.

In other words, are the processes that transformed late-type\ngalaxies into quiescent lenticulars in the past still able to modify the late-type galaxies that are\ncurrently infalling nearby clusters? Trying to answer these questions we now briefly review the\nphysical processes that are believed to describe the interaction of galaxies in high density environments. The comparison of model predictions with observations is particularly well suited in the\nnearby Universe where the multifrequency observations have high spatial resolution.\nTwo broad classes of models are here considered: first the gravitational ones, including all sorts\nof tidal interactions (galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-cluster, harassment), then the hydrodynamical interactions taking place between the galaxy's ISM and the hot intergalactic medium (ram-pressure,\nviscous stripping, thermal evaporation). We also briefly review two hybrid processes: \"starvation\"\n(remotion of the gas feeding the star formation) and \"pre-processing\" (taking place in groups of\ngalaxies falling into clusters) that combine gravitational with hydrodynamic mechanisms.\n\n4.1.\n\nTidal interactions among galaxies\n\nTidal interactions among galaxy pairs act on gas, dust and stars, as well as on dark matter, with\nan efficiency depending on the gravitational bounding of the various components. This produces\nselective morphological transformations. Since tidal forces act as M/R3 , if the typical galaxy radii\nare not too small compared to the average separation between galaxies, tidal interactions can\nbe quite efficient at removing matter from galactic halos (Spitzer & Baade 1951; Richstone 1976;\nFarouki & Shapiro 1981; Icke 1985; Merritt 1983). As shown by the numerical simulations of Valluri\n& Jog (1990), tidal interactions are more efficient in perturbing the loose peripheral or extra-planar\nHI gas, than the molecular gas, located in the inner potential well. For what concerns the star\nformation, both observations (Keel et al. 1985; Kennicutt et al. 1987; Hummel et al. 1990; Condon\net al. 1982) and simulations (Mihos et al. 1992; Iono et al. 2004) of interacting pairs show a major\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\nincrease of the nuclear activity and a milder (if any) in the disk.\nIt is intuitive that tidal interactions among galaxies are boosted in the dense cores of rich clusters\nof galaxies. However, due to the high relative velocities, tidal interactions among cluster galaxies,\nalthough more frequent, have significantly shorter duration than in the \"field\" (tenc \u223c 108 yr, see\nAppendix), thus the effects of the perturbation are less severe. For instance, the formation of bars,\nthat is expected to take place in slow encounters, should be relatively rare in clusters (Mihos 2004).\nThe simulations of Byrd & Valtonen (1990) (applied to spiral galaxies in clusters) show that tidal\ninteractions produce enough gas inflow from the disk to the circumnuclear regions, provided that\nthe perturbation parameter:\nPgg = (Mcomp /Mgal )/(d/rgal )3\n(6)\nis Pgg \u2265 0.006-0.1 (depending on the halo to disk mass ratio), where Mcomp is the companion\nmass, Mgal and rgal are the mass and the visible disk radius of the spiral galaxy respectively and\nd is the separation between the two galaxies. A typical perturbation parameter Pgg for \u223c 10 kpc\nradii galaxies in clusters can be roughly estimated assuming Mcomp \u2243 Mgal and an average galaxy\nseparation \u2243 200 kpc inside a cluster of 2 Mpc radius including \u223c 1000 objects. The resulting\nPgg \u2243 10\u22124 is significantly smaller than the critical Pgg necessary for producing significant gas\ninfall into the nucleus. This simple estimate is confirmed by Fujita (1998), who claims that the\ntypical perturbation induced by a single high-speed encounter among cluster galaxies is too small\nto significantly affect the star formation rate. His model incorporates a more realistic modeling\nof the star formation process based on clouds collisions, than the simple nuclear infall treated by\nByrd & Valtonen (1990). Furthermore, as discussed by Merritt (1984) and by Byrd & Valtonen\n(1990), the frequency of galaxy-galaxy encounters in rich clusters, as measured by the inverse of\nthe relaxation time trelax \u223c some 1010 years (see Table 2 and section 6), comparable to the age of\nthe Universe, is negligibly small (see however Valluri & Jog (1990)).\nOkamoto & Nagashima (2001) and Diaferio et al. (2001) with their hybrid N -body simulation and\nsemi-analytical models, tried to reproduce the cluster morphology-density or morphology-radius\nrelations observed by Whitmore et al. (1993). They concluded that, while the distribution of\nelliptical galaxies in clusters can be obtained with major merging, this is not the case for the\nlenticular galaxies with intermediate bulge to disk ratios. Bulges can be formed by the merging of\ntwo equal mass galaxies, while the subsequent gas cooling can form disks (Diaferio et al. 2001) by\nunequal mass mergers of disk galaxies, where disk destruction is not complete and some rotation\nis retained, or minor mergers between spirals and their companions (the disk is heated but not\ndestroyed). The morphology segregation is qualitatively well reproduced by the semi-analytical\nsimulation of Springel et al. (2001). Okamoto & Nagashima (2003), however, remarked that this\nresult is very sensitive to the assumed bulge to disk ratio of lenticular galaxies.\nTypical examples of cluster galaxies which recently underwent a gravitational interaction are NGC\n4438 and NGC 4435 in Virgo (see sect. 4.10). Tidally interacting objects in clusters are relatively\ndifficult to identify since tidal tracers are very short-lived: while in the field most of the ejected\nmaterial in tidal tails remains bounded to the main galaxy, in clusters the tidal field strips the\nunbound material, maybe originating the diffuse intergalactic light (Mihos 2004).\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nTidal interaction between galaxies and the cluster potential well\n\nGiven the large mass of clusters, exceeding 1014 M\u2299, tidal interactions between galaxies and\nthe whole cluster potential well can effectively perturb cluster galaxies, inducing gas inflow, bar\nformation, nuclear and perhaps disk star formation (Merritt 1984; Miller 1986; Byrd & Valtonen\n1990). Depending on the impact parameter, the disk structure can be perturbed, forming a spiral\npattern (if the disk is parallel to the orbital plane), or developing a bulge (disk perpendicular or\ninclined with respect to the orbital plane, (Valluri 1993)). In any case the thickness of the disk\nis expected to increase slightly (Valluri 1993). Tidally perturbed disk galaxies in clusters, due to\nthe increased non-circular velocities of stars can produce declining rotation curves at large radii\n(Valluri 1994).\nThe models of Fujita (1998), Valluri (1993) and Henriksen & Byrd (1996) show that tidal forces\nby the cluster potential well can accelerate molecular clouds of disk galaxies falling toward the\ncluster center. The rise of the kinetic pressure in the interstellar medium induces star formation\n(Elmegreen & Efremov 1997).\nThe efficiency of the interaction can be quantified by the perturbation parameter Pgc defined\nas (Byrd & Valtonen 1990) 12 :\nPgc = (Mcluster /Mgal ) \u00d7 (R/rgal )\u22123\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R is the distance of the galaxy from the cluster center. When the perturbation parameter\nbecomes critical (Pgc \u223c0.006-0.1), the gas in the disk is driven toward the center of the galaxy on\ntime scales of 2-3 108 yr, triggering nuclear activity (Byrd & Valtonen 1990).\nFor a perturbation parameter close to the critical value, however, the interaction is unable to remove\nthe outer gas producing the observed HI-deficiency of cluster galaxies (Byrd & Valtonen 1990).\nByrd & Valtonen (1990) and Henriksen & Byrd (1996) speculate that the poorly gravitationally\nbound HI would be ejected from the galactic plane by supernova winds driven by the enhanced star\nformation activity. The effects of the interaction on the inner gaseous component are less clear. The\nmolecular gas, shielded deeper inside the galaxy potential well would not be ejected, but consumed\nby star formation events on longer time scales.\nThe perturbation parameter for Coma, A1367 and Virgo galaxies can be derived using the empirical\nmass vs. diameter relation:\nLog(Mgal ) (M \u2299) = 8.46 + 2.37 \u00d7 Log(rgal )\n\n(kpc)\n\nFor the largest galaxies (rgal =30 kpc) we find on average Pgc =0.28 for Coma, 0.16 for A1367 and\n0.06 for Virgo, at a typical distance of R=500 kpc from the cluster center. Figure 16 shows that\n12\n\nPgc as determined using eq. 7 and rtidal given by eq. 8 must be considered as indicative since both equations are\nbased on the hypothesis that the cluster potential is dominated by a unique dark matter halo and do not account\nfor perturbations by the halos of individual galaxies. A more accurate estimate of both parameters requires N-body\nsimulations to account for these non-linear effects.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\nthe perturbation parameter becomes critical (Pgc \u223c 0.1) first for large galaxies passing within few\nhundred kpc of the cluster center. Notice also that the perturbation parameter, at any given\ndistance from the cluster center increases with the galaxy size (luminosity). Since the local tidal\n\nFig. 16.- The logarithm of the perturbation parameter, defined in eq. 7, is plotted as a function\nof the distance from the cluster center (left panel) for Coma galaxies of linear radius 30 and 5 kpc\nrespectively (top to bottom) and as a function of the H band luminosity (right panel) for Coma\ngalaxies at 200 and 800 kpc (top to bottom) from the cluster center.\nfield varies as the inverse cube of the separation, and since this quantity is much larger than the\ntypical size of spiral galaxies, disturbances are expected to be symmetric, contrary to galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions (Byrd & Valtonen 1990).\nGas removal can take place only outside the tidal radius rtidal (the galactocentric distance up to\nwhich the perturbation is effective in removing material) which can be estimated for galaxies near\nthe core radius Rc 13 of the Coma, A1367 and Virgo clusters using the cluster parameters listed in\nTable 1 and (Merritt 1984):\nrtidal /Rc \u223c 0.5 \u00d7 \u2206Vgal /\u03b4Vcluster\n(8)\nwhere \u2206Vgal and \u03b4Vcluster are the rotational velocity of the galaxy and the cluster velocity dispersion\nrespectively. Using an empirical relationship between the optical radius and the rotational velocity:\n\u2206Vgal = 21.55 \u00d7 rgal (kpc) + 50.00\n\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nwe can estimate the tidal radius rtidal at the core radii of the three clusters as a function of the\ngalaxy optical radii:\nrtidal (Coma)=3.15 rgal + 7.30 kpc, rtidal (A1367)=3.15 rgal + 7.30 kpc and rtidal (V irgo)=1.58 rgal\n+ 3.67 kpc. The truncation radius of galaxies in Coma and A1367 is thus significantly larger than\nthe optical and even of the HI radius (which is \u223c 1.8 times larger than the optical one, Cayatte\net al. (1994)), while it is comparable to the HI radius in Virgo.\nIn conclusion, tidal interactions with the cluster potential can induce an increase of the nuclear\n13\n\nThe lowest values for the tidal radius are expected close to the core radius (Merritt 1984)\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\nactivity of cluster galaxies and, eventually, a decrease of the total gas amount consumed through\nstar formation events. On the other hand, gas can be hardly removed directly by the interaction.\n\n4.3.\n\nGalaxy harassment\n\nMoore et al. (1996, 1998, 1999) proposed that the evolution of cluster galaxies is governed by\nthe combined effect of multiple high speed galaxy-galaxy close (\u223c 50 kpc) encounters with the interaction with the potential of the cluster as a whole, a process that they named \"galaxy harassment\".\nHarassment depends on the collisional frequency, on the strength of the individual collisions, on\nthe cluster's tidal field and on the distribution of the potential within galaxies.\nMoore et al. simulations show that, at a fixed mean orbital radius, galaxies on elongated orbits\nexperience greater harassment than objects on circular orbits. The multiple encounters heat the\nstellar component increasing the velocity dispersion and decreasing the angular momentum, meanwhile they make the gas to sink toward the galaxy center (Moore et al. 1996).\nBecause of their different potential distribution, massive and dwarf galaxies react differently to\ngalaxy harassment. N-body (both pure gravitational and hydro-dynamical) simulations of lowmass (L\u2217 /5 and L\u2217 /20) spirals (represented by rotating exponential disks) in a Coma-like cluster\nshow that, at any given galaxy radius, dark matter is more easily stripped than stars because of\nthe different orbital distribution of the two components. At early stages a large fraction (up to\n50%) of the stars are removed; the subsequent increase of binding energy, caused by the increase\nof the central density, makes further star stripping less efficient. The obtained stellar profiles are\nexponentials, when only stars are included in the initial conditions, and nucleated exponentials\nwhen the gas is added (Moore et al. 1998). All these properties, including the observed increase\nof the velocity dispersion, mimic those of cluster spheroidals. The simulations also show that the\nsmallest spheroidals are destroyed in the inner (half of the virial radius) cluster. Only the densest\nand/or the nucleated objects would survive longer. Another model prediction is that nucleated\nobjects have higher velocity dispersion than normal spheroidals 14 .\nThe evolution of bright disk galaxies (\u223c L\u2217 ) in clusters differs from that of low-mass systems, as it\ndepends primarily on the depth of their potential wells and on the disk scale length. High surface\nbrightness galaxies, those with central steeply rising rotation curves, are found relatively stable\nto galaxy harassment. Beside minor star losses, the effect of the interaction is a small (0.5 mag\narcsec\u22122 ) increase of the central surface brightness, an increase of the disk scale height (by a factor\nof 2-4) and of the central velocity dispersion, with the fading of spiral features (Moore et al. 1999).\nThese structural and kinematic properties resemble those of bright lenticulars.\nLow surface brightness galaxies, because of their low mass concentration (flat rotation curves and\nlarge disk scale lengths), are strongly perturbed by the interaction. They are expected to loose\n14\n\nThe velocity dispersion of normal dwarf ellipticals and spheroidals in Virgo cluster A is slightly (\u223c 10 %) smaller\nthan that of their nucleated counterparts\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\nmost (up to 50-90 %) of their stars (the progenitors of the diffuse cluster light?), to increase their\ncentral velocity dispersion and consequently their central surface brightness by \u223c 2 mag arcsec\u22122\n(Moore et al. 1999). Their resulting kinematic and structural properties resemble those of dE/dS0.\nAn increased star formation activity is expected because of the central accumulation of gas and of\nthe heating of molecular clouds, increasing the probability of cloud-cloud encounters, as shown by\nthe models of Fujita (1998).\nThe recent simulations of Virgo like clusters by Gnedin (2003) adopting various cosmologies (\u03a90 =1,\n0.4 with and without \u039b) show that tidal heating is more effective in low-\u03a90 clusters. The maximum\nof the tidal forces do not always happen close to the cluster center, but during the encounters with\nmassive galaxies or with unvirialized remnants of infalling groups of galaxies. These simulations\nalso show that the collision rate of galaxies increases by 10-50% in the presence of substructures.\nIn conclusion, galaxy harassment can effectively perturb low-luminosity galaxies because of their\nlow-density cores and slowly rising rotation curves, thus contributing to the formation of cluster\ndwarf ellipticals (Moore et al. 1998), to the fueling of low-luminosity AGNs (Lake et al. 1998) and\nto the destruction of low surface brightness galaxies in clusters (Moore et al. 1999). The effects on\nmassive objects should be less pronounced, with a minor increase of the disk star formation activity\n(Mihos 2004) and an increase of the velocity dispersion in the bulge (Moore et al. 1996).\n\n4.4.\n\nRam-pressure\n\nGunn & Gott (1972) first proposed that the ISM could be removed from galaxies moving at\n\u223c 1000 km s\u22121 through the hot (\u223c 107 -108 K) and dense (\u223c 10\u22123 -10\u22124 atoms cm\u22123 ) intergalactic\nmedium by the ram-pressure mechanism. The interpretation of head-tail radio galaxies (Miley et al.\n1972) in the ram-pressure scenario brought to the prediction of a dense IGM in clusters of galaxies\nbefore X-ray observations actually detected it (Gursky et al. 1972).\nRam-pressure can effectively remove the ISM if it overcomes the gravitational pressure anchoring\nthe gas to the disk:\n2\n\u03c1IGM Vgal\n\u2265 2\u03c0G\u03a3star \u03a3gas\n(9)\nwhere \u03c1IGM is the density of the IGM, Vgal the galaxy velocity inside the cluster, \u03a3star is the star\nsurface density and \u03a3gas the gas surface density.\nA plethora of N-body and SPH simulations exists in the literature trying to investigate the role\nof ram-pressure on gas stripping of both cluster early- and late-type galaxies, and on the possible\ntransformation of spiral into lenticular galaxies, or of dwarf irregulars into dSph.\nThe various models (SPH, N-body) differ in the way they account for the cluster gas distribution\n(density profile), the galaxy orbits within the cluster (radial, circular, galaxy inclination with respect to the orbit), the potential distribution within the galaxy (disk vs. bulge, with or without\ndark matter), the star formation (gas consumption and replenishment by recycled gas), the contribution of viscosity and/or thermal evaporation. In spite of these differences, assuming typical IGM\ndensities and velocity dispersions observed in nearby clusters, all variations of the model concur at\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\nestablishing that ram-pressure is sufficient to remove part of the ISM from galaxies on time scales\ncomparable with their cluster crossing time (a few 10 9 yr, see Sect. 6).\nRadial orbits are more efficient because of the higher velocity, closer crossing to the cluster core\n(Abadi et al. 1999; Quilis et al. 2000; Vollmer et al. 2001b). The efficiency of removal depends\non the inclination of the galaxy disk with respect to the trajectory, with face-on interactions more\nefficient than edge-on or inclined encounters (Abadi et al. 1999; Quilis et al. 2000; Vollmer et al.\n2001b). However spiral galaxies on radial orbits should end up stripped because their interaction\nwith the cluster IGM will sooner or later become face-on since the orientation of the galaxy rotation axis is conserved (Quilis et al. 2000). Because of their shallower potential well, gas removal is\nexpected to act more efficiently on dwarf irregular galaxies than on giant spirals (Mori & Burkert\n2000; Marcolini et al. 2003). Models indicate that the ram-pressure efficiency is higher if the galaxy\nISM has a multiphase structure, containing bubbles, shells and holes ranging in size from a few\nparsec to a kiloparsec, and if it is taken into account that HI disks are centrally depleted even in\nisolated galaxies (Quilis et al. 2000).\nBefore leading to a complete gas ablation, ram-pressure produces significant compression ahead of\nthe galaxy, with the possible formation of a bow-shock and of a low density gaseous tail behind,\ngiving to the galaxy a cometary shape (Balsara et al. 1994; Stevens et al. 1999; Murakami & Babul\n1999; Quilis et al. 2000; Mori & Burkert 2000). When the interaction is close to edge-on the central\ngas density can increase by a factor of \u223c 1.5 (Vollmer et al. 2001b), because the outer HI is captured\nby the inner disk. The distribution of the HI gas can be very asymmetric, depending on the impact\nparameters (Vollmer et al. 2001b). Only clouds with a surface density < 4 10\u22123 g cm\u22122 can be\nswept out of the galaxy. Since molecular clouds have surface densities of the order of 10\u22122 g cm\u22122 ,\nthey are mostly unaffected by the interaction (Quilis et al. 2000), although the gas compression\ncan facilitate the collapse of molecular clouds, thereby increasing the star formation rate (Bekki &\nCouch 2003).\nTosa (1994) shows that ram-pressure generates a single-armed spiral structure in the galactic gas,\nwith the spiral pattern having a retrograde rotation, while ring-like features can form in the inner\ndisk (Sofue & Wakamatsu 1993; Schulz & Struck 2001). The models of Schulz & Struck (2001) also\nshow that the displacement of the gas with respect to the disk can trigger gravitational instabilities,\nwith the formation of flocculent spirals. These spiral arms transport angular momentum outward,\ncompressing the inner disk and forming a prominent gas ring. Inclined galaxies experience less gas\nremoval but a larger angular momentum loss then face-on events (Schulz & Struck 2001).\nGas can be accreted from the downstream side into the core (Balsara et al. 1994; Vollmer et al.\n2001b; Schulz & Struck 2001), in particular in retrograde encounters, where the loss of angular\nmomentum can create a galactic disk (Sofue & Wakamatsu 1993). In the case of edge-on stripping\nmore than 50% of the stripped gas can be re-accreted, whereas in face-on encounters the fraction\nof re-accreted gas is significantly smaller (Vollmer et al. 2001b). This re-accreted gas might temporarily increase the disk surface density (Vollmer et al. 2001b).\nThe hydrodynamic interaction between the hot IGM and the cold ISM leads to an increase of the\nexternal pressure, the formation of bow-shocks, thermal instabilities and turbulent motions within\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\nthe disk of the galaxy. All these phenomena increase cloud-cloud collisions, cloud collapse, and\ncan thus be responsible for an enhanced star formation activity of cluster galaxies (Evrard 1991;\nBekki & Couch 2003). By modeling pressure variations of the ISM due to ram-pressure, combined\nwith HI to H2 gas transformation (molecular cloud formation and destruction) and HI sweeping,\nFujita (1998) and Fujita & Nagashima (1999) quantified the variations of the star formation activity following the formalism of Elmegreen & Efremov (1997). Their models show that on short\ntime scales (\u223c 108 yr) in high density, rich clusters the star formation activity can increase up to a\nfactor of 2 at most. On longer timescales, however, the removal of the HI gas reservoir leads to a\ndecrease of the fuel feeding the star formation, and galaxies become quiescent (Fujita 1998; Fujita\n& Nagashima 1999; Okamoto & Nagashima 2001). This mild increase of the star formation activity\nis however not observed in models with low gas density and shallow potential clusters.\nA decrease of the molecular gas content of cluster disk galaxies (up to \u223c 80%) is expected from\nthe gas consumption due to the increase of star formation activity (from 0.1 to 0.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 8 Myr\nafter the cloud collapse; Bekki & Couch (2003)) and not from gas removal during the interaction.\nIt is interesting to note that in clusters with typical gas temperature and velocity dispersion, the\nincrease of star formation is higher during the transit in the cluster outskirts, where the IGM density is lower, than near the cluster center where gas removal by ram-pressure suppresses the star\nformation (Bekki & Couch 2003).\nThe old stellar component is unperturbed during ram-pressure interactions (Quilis et al. 2000).\nFor face-on interactions, however, the gas escaping from the plane can induce tidal forces on the\ngalaxy stellar disk shallowing the potential well on time scales comparable with the time scale for\ngas stripping (\u223c some 108 yr). These forces can increase the velocity dispersion perpendicular to\nthe disk, thickening the stellar disk. The N-body simulations of Farouki & Shapiro (1980) showed\nthat the thickening of the disk is possible only in the outer disk since only there the gas is removed,\nleaving the inner disk unaffected. It is thus unlikely that ram-pressure formed the thick and large\nbulges of S0s (Farouki & Shapiro 1980). Schulz & Struck (2001) speculated however that successive\ncrossing of the cluster can produce cycles of annealing, which might form the prominent bulges\ntypical of S0s.\nIf ram-pressure is responsible for the HI ablation in clusters we would expect from Eq. 9 a\n2 /2\u03c0G\u03a3\ncorrelation between the HI-deficiency parameter and \u03c1IGM Vgal\nstar \u03a3gas . Let's check the calculation for 3 nearby clusters, Coma, A1367 and Virgo (as usual using data from GOLDmine).\nWe\nq\n2\n.\nassume \u03b4Vcluster (for the late-type component) and \u03c1IGM from Table 1 and let Vgal = 3\u03b4Vcluster\n\nThe stellar surface density within the optical diameter (in units of g cm\u22122 ) can be estimated from\nthe H band luminosity, assuming a mass to light ratio of 4.6 (Gavazzi et al. 1996):\n\u03a3star =\n\n4.6LH\n\u03c0(a/2)2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere LH is the H band luminosity and a is the optical major diameter.

(2002), or assuming that H2 is\non average 15% of the total HI gas), and assuming that the HI gas diameter is \u223c 1.8 times larger\nthan the optical one 15 :\nM (HI) + M (H2 )\n(11)\n\u03a3gas =\n\u03c0(1.8a/2)2\nThe derived gas surface density \u03a3gas is a weakly decreasing function of the H band luminosity when\ngalaxies with a normal HI gas content (HI deficiency \u22640.3) are considered: Log\u03a3gas =21.264-0.063\nLogLH (atom cm\u22122 ), as shown in Fig. 17 (filled dots).\nThe reader should not be surprised by the (mild) anti-correlation between Log\u03a3gas and LogLH\nsince it is known that the gaseous mass fraction decreases with increasing mass (Boselli et al.\n2001).\nAt this stage we can estimate an empirical relationship between the gravitational potential 2 \u03c0 G\n15\n\nSince deficient galaxies have the HI gas mostly removed from the outskirts, the gas surface density is underestimated in galaxies with an HI deficiency parameter \u2265 0.3.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 19.- The relationship between the HI-deficiency parameter and the H band luminosity (in\nlogarithmic scale) for Coma (squares), A1367 (triangles) and Virgo (circles) galaxies.

It turns out\nthat in the three clusters ram-pressure can effectively remove the atomic HI from any object with\nvelocity similar or larger than the average cluster velocity dispersion16 . This result is consistent\nwith Vollmer et al. (2001b), who were able to reproduce the observed radial truncation of the HI\ndisks in Virgo cluster galaxies. Given the dependence of the gravitational potential from the total\nH band luminosity, ram-pressure is expected to be more efficient at removing gas from low-mass\nobjects than from massive spirals. This seems not confirmed observationally in Fig. 19 where the\nexpected inverse relationship between the HI-deficiency parameter and the total mass of galaxies\nis not seen. This, however, is due to an observational bias because, at any given HI sensitivity,\ngalaxies with larger HI deficiencies are more difficult to detect at low mass. In order to detect high\nHI deficiencies in dwarf galaxies it would be important to push the Arecibo observations of Virgo\ndwarf galaxies to very low limits17 , beyond those reached by Hoffman et al. (1996) or Gavazzi et al.\n16\n\nThe efficiency of ram-pressure may be overestimated assuming the cluster central gas density \u03c1IGM , as we did.\nHowever this should not represent a severe problem for most galaxies in radial orbits that will soon or later pass near\nthe cluster center.\n17\n\nThis is in fact a high-priority project for the ALFA multi-beam system at Arecibo (Giovanelli et al. 2005a).\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n(2005b) and to better calibrate the HI deficiency parameter for dwarf systems, as attempted by\nLee et al.

Smaller objects experience laminar viscosity 19 .\nAs remarked by Nulsen (1982), if the flow velocity Vgal exceeds the adiabatic sound speed in the hot\np\ngas 5/3 cIGM (1450, 970, 730 km s\u22121 for Coma, A1367 and Virgo respectively) a shock will form\nahead of the ISM. The stripping will occur preferentially on the front side of the galaxy, producing\n\n18\n\nThese values have to be taken as upper limits since \u03bbIGM might significantly decrease in the presence of weak\ntangled magnetic fields\n19\n\nThe condition \u03bbIGM \u2264 rgal is satisfied for rgal \u2265 3.2, 1.4 and 0.4 kpc in Coma, A1367 and Virgo respectively\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\nan asymmetric gas distribution even on galaxies moving edge-on inside the IGM.\nThe time scales for complete gas stripping are relatively short: for both large (20 kpc; 5 109 M\u2299)\nand small (5 kpc; 5 108 M\u2299) galaxies in the Coma cluster, the time needed to completely remove\nthe atomic gas is \u223c 4 107 yr. Longer times are needed in A1367 and Virgo: \u223c 108 yr for large\ngalaxies, from 4 (A1367) to 10 (Virgo) times longer for smaller objects.\nThe signature of viscous stripping on the structural, kinematic properties, molecular gas content\nand star formation activity of galaxies is expected to be similar to that of ram-pressure.\nUGC 6697, proposed by Nulsen (1982) as the prototype of a galaxy ongoing turbulent viscous\nstripping, is in fact a merging galaxy (see sect. 4.10).\n\n4.6.\n\nThermal evaporation\n\nAs shown by Cowie & Songaila (1977) thermal evaporation can efficiently remove gas in cluster\ngalaxies. If the IGM temperature is high compared to the galaxy velocity dispersion, at the interface\nbetween the hot IGM and the cold ISM the temperature of the ISM rises rapidly, the gas evaporates\nand is not retained by the gravitational field.\nThe mass loss rate can be estimated using the relation:\n2\n\u03c1IGM cIGM 4\u03c6s F (\u03c3o )\n\u1e40evaporation = \u03c0rgal\n\n(14)\n\nwith \u03c6s \u22431, \u03c3o =1.84 \u03bbIGM /(rgal \u03c6s ) and F (\u03c3o ) =2\u03c3o for \u03c3o \u22641 (Nulsen 1982) (\u03bbIGM is defined in\nsection 4.5). Given the properties of the three considered clusters, \u03c3o \u22641 holds true for all galaxies,\nthus we can assume F (\u03c3o ) =2\u03c3o , and eq. 14 reduces to:\n\u1e40evaporation \u2243 14.7\u03c0rgal \u03c1IGM cIGM \u03bbIGM\n\n(15)\n\nwhere cIGM is defined in section 4.5.\nThermal evaporation is a sensitive function of the IGM temperature and of the magnetic field, and\nto a lesser extent of the density (Cowie & Songaila 1977); its efficiency can be reduced in presence\nof magnetic fields (Vikhlinin et al. 1997). A typical galaxy of radius 15 kpc and 5 109 M\u2299 of atomic\ngas can be completely stripped (assuming no magnetic fields) in \u223c 4 107 yr in Coma, 3 108 yr in\nA1367 and \u223c 109 yr in Virgo.\nAs for the viscous stripping, the effects of the thermal evaporation on the kinematic and structural\nproperties of cluster galaxies, as well as on the molecular gas content and star formation activity\nare difficult to quantify.\n\n4.7.\n\nStarvation\n\nGalaxy \"starvation\" or \"strangulation\", a process proposed more than 20 years ago by Larson\net al. (1980) to explain the transformation of spirals into lenticulars, has been recently invoked to\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\n\nFig. 20.- The mass loss rate for thermal evaporation (without magnetic fields: dashed line) and\nram-pressure (or turbulent viscous stripping) for galaxies in Coma, A1367 and Virgo with radii >\n10, 4 and 1 kpc respectively (continuum line) and laminar viscous stripping (dotted line) are given\nas a function of the H band luminosity (linear\nq size on the top axis) in the left panel.

Same layout\nas in Fig. 20 (left panel)\n\n\f\u2013 50 \u2013\nexplain the mild gradient in the morphology fraction found outside one virial radius in a cluster\nat z=0.4 (Treu et al. 2003). Emphasis is put on the large scale on which such a mechanism might\nbe effective, contrary to other mechanisms previously described that, except galaxy harassment,\nare supposed to work on smaller scales (Treu et al. 2003; Balogh et al. 2000). Since in normal\ngalaxies the gas that feeds the star formation (on time scales as long as the Hubble time) comes\nfrom infall of an extended gas reservoir, the effect of removing the outer galaxy halo would be that\nof preventing further infall of gas into the disk. On time scales of a few Gyr the star formation\nwould thus exhaust the available gas, quenching further star formation activity.\nThe seminal idea of Larson et al. (1980) has been elaborated by Bekki et al. (2002). Their numerical\nsimulations showed that even if a spiral orbits a cluster with a pericenter distance of \u223c 3 core radii,\n\u223c 80% of its halo is stripped within a few Gyr by the hydrodinamical interaction with the ICM\nplus the global tidal field of the cluster, preventing gas accretion into the disk, and consequently\nsuppressing the star formation. In the end the spiral structure becomes less pronounced, and\ngalaxies progressively becomes anemic, disk-dominated lenticulars. They might coincide with the\nsmall percentage of passive, anemic galaxies found in the SDSS by Goto et al. (2003a) at large\nclustercentric distances. Starvation, with its long time-scale, was invoked by Balogh et al. (2000)\nto explain the smooth transition in the star formation activity observed radially around density\nenhancements in the 2dF.\n\n4.8.\n\nPreprocessing\n\nAccording to the hierarchical scenario for the formation of large scale structures, groups of\ngalaxies infalling onto clusters of galaxies represent the building blocks of today rich clusters of\ngalaxies. Substructures seen in the X-rays and in kinematical studies of clusters of galaxies are\nthe strongest evidence in favor of this cluster formation mechanism (Kodama et al. 2005). Galaxy\ngroups may therefore represent natural sites for a preprocessing stage in the evolution of cluster\ngalaxies (Mihos 2004; Fujita 2004; Dressler 2004) through tidal interactions, otherwise ineffective in\nhigh velocity dispersion environments. Meanwhile ram-pressure, starvation and evaporation might\nbe already effective in these groups at z \u223c 0.5, as shown by the simulations of Fujita (2004). Preprocessing might represent the ideal circumstance for the formation of lenticulars through unequal-mass\nmergers or minor mergers in spirals (Kodama & Smail 2001). These relatively violent events, as\nopposed to starvation, are able to heat up the disks, thus producing high bulge to disk lenticulars,\nas those observed in clusters. Since preprocessing occurs well outside the core of rich clusters, this\nmechanism has been invoked to explain why the atomic gas content and the star formation activity\nare found suppressed at large clustercentric distances (\u223c 1 virial radius) (Kodama et al. 2001).\nAlthough preprocessing might be at the origin of the post-starburst galaxy population in the SW\nextension of the Coma cluster (Caldwell et al. 1993), this mechanism is rare in nearby clusters,\nbecause in \u039b cosmologies the rate of accretion of small groups on clusters has decreased at the\npresent epoch. As remarked by Dressler (2004), the peak of groups in the building of cluster should\nhappen at z \u223c 0.5. In the Virgo cluster, for instance, the substructures that are now collapsing into\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\nthe main cluster have already grown massive enough to prevent preprocessing. There exist however\nan example of ongoing preprocessing taking place in A1367 (see Sect. 4.10.3). It should also be\nemphasized that local clusters contain significant examples of healthy spiral galaxies that made it\nto the inner cluster regions without being \"wounded\" by preprocessing and that are receiving their\nfirst and fatal kick directly from ram-pressure. Two are CGCG 97-073 and 079 in A1367 that are\njust as actively star forming as isolated objects and many other HI and H\u03b1 healthy galaxies that\nlie between the virial and the core cluster radii.\n\n4.9.\n\nComparison between the various processes\n\nWe conclude that the relative importance of the processes considered above in nearby clusters\ndepends on parameters that are difficult to quantify for individual galaxies, primarily depending\non their 3-D position with respect the cluster center. Some general conclusions can however be\nsummarized as follows:\n1) Effects of the perturbation:\na) Gravitational interactions (galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-cluster, harassment) can induce nuclear gas\ninfall that can be at the origin of nuclear activity. They can also contribute to heating up stellar\ndisks and thus increasing the bulge to disk ratio (while retaining some bulge rotation). These\nprocesses are more efficient in low-luminosity and low-surface brightness galaxies, which might be\neasily transformed into dE. Gravitational interactions are thus able to transform spirals into lenticulars.\nTidal interactions with the cluster as a whole can hardly remove the outer HI disks since the truncation radius is larger than the HI disk radius. Thus they cannot be at the origin of the HI-deficient\ngalaxy population in nearby clusters.\nb) Interactions with the hot ICM can efficiently remove the outer disk gas and quench the star\nformation (directly by gas removal or via starvation) but they can hardly increase the bulge to disk\nratio, as requested to explain the morphology segregation.\n2) Time scales and probabilities:\nGiven the high velocity dispersion in clusters, the probability that spiral galaxies are perturbed by\ntidal interactions with nearby companions is extremely low. The time scale for tidal interactions\n(relaxation time) is some 1010 yr. Times scales for ram-pressure gas stripping (\u223c one crossing time,\n109 yr) are shorter than for harassment (several crossing times), where multiple encounters are\nnecessary. In relaxed, gas rich clusters such as Coma, the time scale for gas removal for thermal\nevaporation or viscous stripping are very short (less than 108 yr), while some 108 yr in unrelaxed,\ngas poor clusters such as A1367 or Virgo. Models indicate that the time scale for galaxy starvation\nare of the order of some Gyr.\n\n\f\u2013 52 \u2013\n3) Efficiency as a function of the clustercentric distance:\nThe galaxy - cluster IGM interactions are most efficient close to the cluster center where the density and the temperature of the IGM (as well as the velocity of galaxies) reach their maxima. The\nperturbations induced by the cluster potential are also most efficient in the cluster center since the\ncluster tidal field is maximum at the core radius. Although the duration of the interaction might\nbe shorter (because of the high relative velocity) than in the cluster outskirts, the frequency of\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions reaches the maximum in the densest central regions. These processes\nseems thus confined to the inner part of the cluster, inside the virial radius.\nBecause of the combined action of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster gravitational interactions,\ngalaxy harassment might be effective also at the cluster periphery. For similar reasons starvation\nand pre-processing might be effective well outside the cluster core and even outside the virial radius.\n4) Relative importance of hydrodynamical mechanisms:\nThe relative importance of the three interactions between galaxies and the cluster IGM: viscous\nstripping, thermal evaporation and ram-pressure can be quantified. The mass loss rates \u1e40 \u2243\nF/vgal are comparable for turbulent viscous and ram-pressure stripping, both being proportional\nto \u03c0r 2 \u03c1IGM Vgal . The laminar viscous stripping and the thermal evaporation have the same analytical dependence on the cluster and galaxy parameters, but the thermal evaporation is about three\ntimes more effective than the laminar viscous stripping.\nAt any given impact angle, position and transit velocity through the cluster (which are statistically\nknown quantities), ram-pressure and viscous stripping dominate over thermal evaporation for large\nand fast galaxies. For small (dwarf) galaxies \u1e40evap > \u1e40lam > \u1e40ram while for the giants it depends\non the cluster: in Virgo \u1e40ram dominates over the other processes, in Coma thermal evaporation\ndominates over ram-pressure. Because of its higher IGM density and temperature, mass losses are\non average 10 times larger in the Coma than in the Virgo cluster.\n\n4.10.\n\nPrototypes of environmental disturbances\n\nWe briefly review a few nearby, well studied objects that may be considered as representatives\nof specific perturbation mechanisms.\n\n4.10.1.\n\nTidal interactions\n\nGalaxies showing evident signs of an ongoing tidal interaction are relatively rare in nearby\nclusters. In Virgo for example, where the morphological classification is excellent owing to the\navailable du Pont plates (Binggeli et al. 1985), only NGC 4438 out of 1802 galaxies classified as\ncluster members has clear tidal tails or other signs of ongoing tidal interactions.\n\n\f\u2013 53 \u2013\nThe peculiar Sb galaxy NGC 4438 has recently undergone a high velocity, off-center (\u223c 900 km\ns\u22121 ) encounter with the nearby (22 kpc projected separation) SB0 galaxy NGC 4435. NGC 4438\nshows strong and extended tidal tails in both the optical (Arp 1966), near-IR (Boselli et al. 1997b)\nand UV (Boselli et al. 2005a). Both the atomic and molecular gas are displaced by \u223c 5 kpc, toward\nthe companion (Combes et al. 1988; Cayatte et al. 1990; Kenney et al. 1995), coinciding in position\nwith the peak of the X-ray and radio continuum emission. The galaxy, with a mild nuclear activity,\nshows nuclear star formation and filaments of ionized gas originating from the plane of the disk\n(Kenney et al. 1995; Kenney & Yale 2002), and has a perturbed H\u03b1 rotation curve (Kenney et al.\n1995; Chemin et al. 2005). Whether some cold dust frozen into the ISM was removed during the\ninteraction is hard to tell: no 6.75 nor 15 \u03bcm emission is detected in mid-IR ISOCAM images\nat the level of a few \u03bcJy arcsec\u22122 neither associated with the HI/CO peaks nor along the tidal\ntails (Boselli et al. 2003b). By combining multifrequency spectro-photometric data with population\nsynthesis and galaxy evolution models Boselli et al. (2005a) showed that the galaxy recently (\u223c\n10 Myr) underwent an instantaneous burst of star formation, significantly younger than the tidal\ninteraction with NGC 4435, dated by dynamical models at \u223c 100 Myr ago (Combes et al. 1988;\nVollmer et al. 2005). It is interesting that the fraction of stellar mass produced by this starburst is\n<0.1 % of the total galaxy stellar mass, extremely small even in such a violent interaction.\nAnother example of ongoing, although in a more advanced stage, dynamical interaction in clusters\nis the merging galaxy UGC 6697 in A1367. This galaxy was originally taken as prototype of ongoing\nturbulent viscous stripping by Nulsen (1982) or of ram-pressure by Gavazzi et al. (1984; 1995b)\nbecause of its strong asymmetric HI (Gavazzi 1989; Dickey & Gavazzi 1991) and radio continuum\nmorphology (Gavazzi & Jaffe 1987; Gavazzi et al. 1995), and its strong star formation activity\n(Gavazzi et al. 1995). Recent X-ray observations with Chandra (Sun & Vikhlinin 2005) reinforce\nthe ram-pressure interpretation. An accurate kinematic study using both long slit and Fabry-Perot\n2-D spectra suggests however the presence of two merging galaxies (Gavazzi et al. 2001c).\nThe presence of long filaments and plumes of ionized gas in the center and in the periphery of M87\n(NGC 4486), the dominant Virgo galaxy, indicate a recent swallowing of a nearby gas rich object;\nthe consequent matter infall is the most likely feeder of nuclear activity in this radio galaxy (Sparks\net al. 1993; Gavazzi et al. 2000a).\nM49 (NGC 4472), the other giant elliptical dominating the Virgo subcluster B, is in tidal interaction with the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 7636 (Patterson & Thuan 1992; Henning et al. 1993;\nMcNamara et al. 1994; Irwin & Sarazin 1996). Most of the HI gas of the dwarf irregular galaxy\nis found at a location intermediate between the dwarf irregular and the giant elliptical. Spatially\ncoincident with the HI cloud Lee et al. (2000) detected an HII region whose metallicity is similar\nto that of UGC 7636. It is likely that tides from M49 first loosened the HI gas, then ram-pressure\ncompleted the gas removal from UGC 7636.\nNGC 4698 (Bertola et al. 1999) and NGC 4772 (Haynes et al. 2000), two Sa galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster appear regular in their morphology, but in fact they show signs of a past merging event, as\nrevealed by the geometric and kinematic decoupling of their disk and gas components. It is worth\nstressing that the information on evolved merging systems lacks completeness, as it requires ad-hoc\n\n\f\u2013 54 \u2013\nhigh-resolution kinematic observations.\n\n4.10.2.\n\nRam-pressure\n\nThe prototype of strong ongoing ram-pressure stripping is the galaxy CGCG 97-073 in A1367\n(Fig. 22). This galaxy, located at the N-W periphery of this spiral rich cluster, is characterized by\nan asymmetric radio morphology, with 75 kpc long radio continuum tails in the direction opposite\nto the cluster center, similar to head-tail radio galaxies, and a steep gradient facing the cluster center (Gavazzi & Jaffe 1987; Gavazzi et al. 1995). The galaxy has also an asymmetric morphology in\nH\u03b1 and at short optical wavelengths (both tracing the young stellar population) with a bow-shock\nstructure in the direction of the cluster center and a low surface brightness tail in the opposite\ndirection (coincident with the direction of the radio continuum tail), while it is quite symmetric in\nthe near-IR (old stellar population) (Gavazzi et al. 1995). The HI gas, unresolved by the available\nVLA observations, is displaced toward the low surface brightness tail (Dickey & Gavazzi 1991),\nwhile the molecular gas is symmetrically distributed (Boselli et al. 1994). This galaxy has the radio\nto far-IR ratio higher than normal spiral galaxies, as well as an enhanced star formation activity\nper unit mass (as traced by its H\u03b1 E.W.) compared to galaxies of similar type and luminosity\n(Gavazzi et al. 1995). Deep H\u03b1 observations revealed the presence of long (75 kpc) tails of ionized\ngas associated to the radio continuum tail (Gavazzi et al. 2001a). All observational evidences indicate that this galaxy is undergoing ram-pressure stripping while entering the cluster for the first\ntime. The interaction removes the HI gas while leaving the molecular gas unaffected, enhancing\nthe star formation in the region facing the interaction with the cluster ICM and forming the radio\ncontinuum and H\u03b1 trails (Gavazzi et al. 1995, 2001a; Boselli et al. 1994; Cortese et al. 2004). The\nongoing interaction produced a weak starburst in the galaxy a few 107 years ago, as shown by\nthe excess H\u03b1 to UV ratio (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. 2004), and triggered a shock compressing the\nmagnetic field in the leading side of the galaxy.\nThe edge-on galaxy CGCG 97-079 is physically and morphologically similar to its near companion\nCGCG 97-073 (long radio continuum (Gavazzi et al. 1995) and ionized gas (Gavazzi et al. 2001a)\ntails, asymmetric HI profile (Dickey & Gavazzi 1991), unperturbed CO distribution (Boselli et al.\n1994), enhanced star formation activity and radio to far-IR ratio (Gavazzi et al. 1995)). It is worth\nmentioning that these two objects are at \u223c 0.4 virial radii from the cluster center, indicating that\nram-pressure is effective not only in the highest density central regions.\nAnother candidate for currently ongoing ram-pressure stripping is NGC 4848 in the Coma cluster.\nIts HI and H\u03b1 distributions are highly asymmetric (Gavazzi 1989; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2001; Vollmer\net al. 2001a). Some of the HI gas removed during the interaction might be falling back into the\ngalaxy from the downstream side, as claimed by Vollmer et al. (2001a).\nWell studied ram-pressure candidates in the Virgo cluster are NGC 4654, NGC 4522, NGC 4548,\nNGC 4569, NGC 4388 and NGC 4402. The morphological asymmetries and the kinematical structure of NGC 4654, however, can be explained only by a combined action of ram-pressure stripping\n(able to reproduce the extended gas) and tidal interaction with the nearby NGC 4639 (responsible\n\n\f\u2013 55 \u2013\n\nFig. 22.- Contours of the radio continuum emission at 1400 MHz of CGCG 97-073 superposed\nto the H\u03b1 frame, showing the head-tail morphology of the extended component (adapted from\nGavazzi et al. (1995)).\n\n\f\u2013 56 \u2013\nfor the asymmetric stellar distribution) (Vollmer 2003). NGC 4522 has an H\u03b1, HI, radio continuum and kinematical properties indicating an ongoing ram-pressure event (Kenney & Koopmann\n1999; Vollmer et al. 2000, 2004b; Kenney et al. 2004). The comparison of model predictions with\nmultifrequency observations made Vollmer et al. (2000) to conclude that the galaxy passed through\nthe cluster center \u223c 6.5 108 yrs ago. Its perturbed H\u03b1 morphology indicates that some recent star\nformation has been induced by the extraplanar atomic gas, probably displaced by ram-pressure\nstripping, falling back into the galaxy from the downstream side of its cometary trail (Vollmer\net al. 2000). NGC 4548 is similar to NGC 4522, except that its face-on orientation makes the observation of the extraplanar gas more indirect (Vollmer et al. 1999). The kinematic analysis of the\nanemic galaxy NGC 4569 in the center of Virgo has shown that its strong HI-deficiency is probably\ndue to a ram-pressure stripping event occurred \u223c 300 Myr ago (Vollmer et al. 2004a). This result\nis in agreement with our recent analysis based on the comparison of multifrequency 2-D images\nwith chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution (Boselli et al. 2005b). The complex\nkinematic of the inner kiloparsec brought however Jogee et al. (2005) to conclude that NGC 4569\nis also in an early stage of bar-driven/tidally driven gas inflow able to perturb the central star\nformation activity.\nIn the Seyfert 2 Virgo galaxy NGC 4388, the ram-pressure stripped gas, seen in the form of extended\nHI filaments, is ionized by the UV radiation field of the active galactic nucleus, producing strong\noptical emission lines (Yoshida et al. 2004; Veilleux et al. 1999). An extended (110\u00d725 kpc) HI\ngas cloud of 3.4 108 M\u2299 has been recently discovered at the north-east of NGC 4388 by Oosterloo\n& van Gorkom (2005). The authors claim that this gas has been removed by the ram-pressure\nexerted by the halo of the nearby M86. Another potential candidate for ram-pressure is NGC 4402,\nwhose H\u03b1 and HI morphology is similar to NGC 4522 (Crowl et al. 2005). Claims for ram-pressure\nstripping in early-type galaxies in Virgo, such as M86 (NGC 4406) are in Rangarajan et al. (1995);\nWhite et al. (1991); Nulsen & Carter (1987) (see however Elmegreen et al. (2000)).\nAnother issue that we wish to stress is that several galaxies that can be considered prototypes of\nthe ram-pressure mechanism, either because their morphology indicates it or because they were\nsuccessfully modeled by Vollmer et al. (2000, 2004a,b); Kenney et al. (2004) as being subject to\nram-pressure stripping are found between 0.3 and 0.75 projected virial radii, i.e. at rather large\nclustercentric distances. Even though the mechanism itself operates at least up to 0.4 virial radii,\nits effects can last sufficiently to affect galaxies that have moved up to \u223c 1 virial radius.\n4.10.3.\n\nPre-processing\n\nThe Blue Infalling Group in A1367 independently discovered by Sakai et al. (2002) and by\nGavazzi et al. (2003b) and recently studied in depth by Cortese et al. (2006) is a typical (and to\nour knowledge unique) example of a pre-processing event in the nearby Universe (see Fig. 23). This\ngroup is composed of two \u223c M \u2217 galaxies (CGCG 97-114 and 97-125) and several star forming dwarfs\nand extragalactic HII regions, all forming stars at a prodigious rate. The group has a small velocity\ndispersion (\u223c 170 kms\u22121 ) and dynamical considerations indicate that it is falling at high velocity\n\n\f\u2013 57 \u2013\n\nFig. 23.- r band continuum (top) and H\u03b1 net (bottom) images of the Blue Infalling Group in\nA1367.

All members\nshow perturbed morphologies and enhanced star formation activity that seem produced by ongoing\ntidal interactions. High metallicity is determined in the group dwarfs and extragalactic HII regions,\nsuggesting that they were produced by the violent tidal interaction between the two massive galaxies\n(Sakai et al. 2002), contrary to what it would be expected if they were independently evolved dwarfs.\nMore evidence for gravitational interactions among the group members is offered by the early-type\ngalaxy CGCG 97-125 (see Fig. 23) whose evident stellar shells witness a recent merging event.\nCortese et al. (2006) discovered long (\u223c 150 kpc) H\u03b1 trails associated with this group that are\ninterpreted as due to ram-pressure stripping exerted by the cluster ICM on the ISM of the high\nvelocity infalling galaxies. The thermal energy in the IGM is invoked to keep the gaseous trails\nionized for a time much longer (108 yr) than the recombination time (107 yr).\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nConclusive evidence built up in the last 25 years that, beside the morphological segregation\neffect, late-type galaxies belonging to rich nearby clusters differ significantly from their \"field\"\ncounterparts. Primarily they are found deficient in atomic gas with respect to isolated galaxies\n(see sect. 2.1). Large HI deficiency parameters provide the clearest signature of their cluster\nmembership. Because of the lack of gas, their star formation is significantly quenched (see sect. 2.6),\ndespite the fact that the molecular gas component seems little perturbed (see sect. 2.2). Additional,\nbut less clear-cut differences are: an excess of radio continuum activity, a higher metallicity and\npossibly a lower dust mass content of galaxies in high density environments. Kinematic properties\ninstead (i.e. rotation curves), witnessing the dark matter distribution, seem little affected in clusters\n(see sect. 2 and 3).\nWhich physical processes, among the ones reviewed in sect. 4, are affecting the evolution\nof late-type galaxies falling on today's clusters? The gravitational perturbations seem unlikely.\nTidal interactions among galaxies are uneffective simply because in today's high velocity dispersion\nclusters they are too short-lived to produce severe disturbances (sect. 4 and 6). The gravitational\ninteraction with the cluster potential might induce some nuclear gas infall, but it can hardly remove\nthe outer disk HI and thus originate the cluster HI-deficient galaxy population (sect. 4.2). Gas\nstripping in HI-deficient galaxies seems too a recent event (some 108 yr) for being produced by\ngalaxy harassment, whose time scale is \u223c ten times longer (sect. 4.3).\nIn today's universe the interactions with the IGM are likely to be dominant. Among interactions\nwith the cluster IGM, evaporation is effective in hot Coma-like clusters, especially for small galaxies,\nunless they are shielded by relevant magnetic fields (sect. 4.6). Ram pressure seems however the\nmost relevant process whenever the gas is not too hot (A1367, Virgo) and provided that the cluster\ncrossing velocity is high (see sect. 4.4). This condition seems satisfied since the orbits of spirals in\nnearby clusters are predominantly radial, as indicated by their non-Gaussian velocity distribution\n(see sect. 3.4). Dynamical simulations confirm this picture also for the young, unrelaxed Virgo\n\n\f\u2013 59 \u2013\ncluster, whose IGM density is not particularly high. Gas stripping might be locally more effective\nif the IGM has a non-uniform, clumpy distribution. Considering that the effects of ram-pressure,\nthermal evaporation and viscous stripping are probably additive, on time scales comparable to a\ncrossing time, any late-type galaxy infalling into a rich cluster is expected to loose most of its\natomic gas reservoir, in particular the weakly gravitationally bound one located in the outer disk.\nObservations corroborate the idea that galaxy - IGM interactions are the dominant phenomena\naffecting the evolution of late-type cluster galaxies in nearby clusters. The location of most severely\nHI-deficient late-type galaxies, with the smallest HI disks near the peaks of the IGM gas density\nargues in favor of the hydrodynamic scenario (sect. 2.1). There is also evidence that spirals in the\n\nFig. 24.- The correlation between the HI deficiency parameter and the square of the velocity\ndeviation along the line of sight, divided by the angular distance from the center of cluster A in\nVirgo. Empty dots give averages in regularly spaced bins.\nVirgo main cluster A show a weak correlation (see Fig. 24) between the HI deficiency parameter\n\n\f\u2013 60 \u2013\nand the quantity (1/\u03b8) \u00d7 \u2206V||2 , proportional to the square of the velocity along the line of sight\ndivided by the angular distance from the cluster center (a quantity that is expected to increase\nwith the the ram-pressure \u03c1 V 2 ), arguing in favor of the ram-pressure hypothesis (notice that V 2\nis very poorly determined from the observable component of the velocity parallel to the line of\nsight). Certainly this evidence does not support the tidal interaction scenario where HI \u2212 def\nshould rather decrease with \u2206V|| .\nThe truncation of the star forming disk in cluster HI-deficient spirals (see sect. 2.6) can also be\nexplained in the ram-pressure scenario because the star formation is progressively suppressed once\nthe gas is removed from the outer disk, as in NGC 4569. The interaction with the cluster IGM\nmight sometime increase, on short time scales and in specific configurations, the total star formation\nactivity of galaxies, as observed (i.e. CGCG 97-073 in A1367) and predicted by models (sect. 4.4),\nbut on long timescales the galaxy global activity should however decrease.\nOn the contrary gravitational interactions are expected to trigger star formation, in particular in\nthe nuclei (sect. 4.1), while the observations have unambiguously shown that on average the star\nformation activity of giant late-type galaxies decreases towards the cluster center. There are also\nevidences that cluster galaxies did not undergo strong bursts of star formation, as their constant\nH\u03b1 to UV flux ratio implies, and that not all cluster galaxies with a truncated gas or young stellar\ndisk have enhanced nuclear activity (gravitational interactions are expected first to trigger nuclear\ngas infall and only in the strongest cases to produce disk truncation) (see sect. 2.6).\nSeveral prototypical galaxies provide convincing cases that the interactions with the cluster IGM are\npredominant in the nearby universe. NGC 4569, the typical HI-deficient, anemic galaxy in the Virgo\ncluster has kinematic and spectro-photometric disk properties that mimic a recent (300-400 Myr)\nram-pressure stripping event (see sect. 4.10). We cannot exclude that some nuclear gas infall has\nbeen induced by the gravitational interaction with the potential of the cluster. Broadly speaking,\nthe fact that most of the HI-deficient galaxies have truncated HI and H\u03b1 disks, but not at longer\nwavelengths confirms that in most cases the interaction responsible for the gas depletion is relatively\nrecent (\u2264 5 108 yr), as in NGC 4569. The existence of several marginally HI-deficient cluster spirals\nwith asymmetric HI-profiles provides further evidence that the galaxy-IGM interaction is a recent\nevent. The long, ionized trails behind CGCG 97-073 and CGCG 97-079 impose even stronger time\nconstraints, indicating that in a few cases the interaction is still undergoing (sect. 4.10 and sect.6).\nThe hydrodynamical galaxy - IGM interaction scenario poses some problems that might however only be apparent. It has been claimed that observing the threshold in the star formation\nactivity at \u223c one virial radius, i.e. at clustercentric distances where the IGM gas density is low\n(Treu et al. 2003), argues against the ram-pressure stripping scenario. This argument has been\nused in favor of other processes dominating the evolution of cluster gas-rich galaxies, such as preprocessing and starvation (Balogh et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2002; Bower & Balogh 2004; Dressler\n2004; Nichol 2004). First of all this result is based on wide field surveys, such as SDSS and 2dF,\nwhere HI data are unavailable and the optical galaxy classification is based on light profiles and/or\nspectra, without direct plate inspection. The threshold in the mean star formation activity of\nlate-type cluster galaxies might be contaminated by the morphology segregation effect.\n\n\f\u2013 61 \u2013\nFurthermore we have stressed that the evidence offered by CGCG 97-079 and 97-073 in A1367\nthat ram-pressure is active at least up to \u223c 0.8 Mpc (0.4 virial radius) combined with other examples\nshowing that the effects of stripping might last until \u223c 1 virial radius, reduces the necessity of\ninvoking other processes such as pre-processing or starvation acting in the outskirt of clusters at\nz=0. Compact groups accreting on clusters, such as the Blue Infalling Group in A1367 (sect.\n4.10), where effective pre-processing might take place, are extremely rare at z=0. We have in fact\nevidence that galaxies infall as individuals (CGCG 97-073 and CGCG 97-079), or belonging to\nextended sub structures with velocity dispersion comparable to already formed clusters (\u2265 500 km\ns\u22121 , sect. 3.4).\nA unified picture that combines near and far, present and past can be drawn coherently if one\ntakes into account that the environmental conditions and the physical properties of galaxies have\nevolved significantly during the cosmic time, making the ranking of the mechanism that prevailed\nin shaping the Hubble sequence to change with time. The number of low velocity dispersion\ninfalling groups, where pre-processing is effective, increased with z; the density of the IGM and\nits temperature decreased with z. The gas fraction and the activity of star formation of galaxies,\nindependently of their environmental conditions, increased significantly from z=0 at least up to\nz=1.\nGiven that the interaction with the cluster IGM cannot easily thicken the disk of a spiral galaxy\nand transform it into an S0 (sect. 3.5)20 , the formation of bulges is obtained straightforwardly\nfrom disk heating (perturbing or even stopping the rotation) during gravitational interactions with\nnearby companions and/or with the cluster potential (galaxy harassment) (sect. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3). The\nobserved kinematical, structural and spectrophotometrical properties of bright lenticulars in nearby\nclusters are consistent with this interpretation. For low-luminosity lenticulars, however, as stated\nby Poggianti et al. (2004), there are some evidences that the suppression of the star formation was\ndue to their interaction with the IGM (sect. 3.5). These considerations have induced groups of\nresearchers working on clusters at high z to identify in gravitational pre-processing the most likely\nmechanism at the origin of the morphological segregation (Dressler 2004), although others invoked\nsmoother processes such as starvation (Balogh et al. 2000). We refer the reader to several papers\nthat appeared in the Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series, Vol. 3: Clusters of Galaxies:\nProbes of Cosmological Structure and Galaxy Evolution (2004) elaborating on this idea.\nSeveral problems concerning the evolution of galaxies in clusters remain unsolved in this unified\nscenario. One deals for example with the origin of dwarf galaxies. Although the strong HI-deficiency\nof cluster dwarf irregulars expected in the hydrodynamical interaction scenario cannot be proved\nbecause of the lack of sensitive HI observations (sect. 2.1), there is evidence that their star formation\nactivity does not decrease with clustercentric distances as for massive objects (sect. 2.6), maybe due\n20\n\nIn the ram-pressure scenario bulges can form only under particular conditions, such as through the triggering of\ncycles of annealing after several crossings of the cluster (Schulz & Struck 2001) or edge-on stripping, when up to 50%\nof the gas can be re-accreted by the disk (Vollmer et al. 2001b) (see sect. 4.4)\n\n\f\u2013 62 \u2013\nto continuous replenishment of gas-rich dwarfs from outside, or maybe because dwarf irregulars,\nafter gas removal, quickly fade into dEs, thus they drop out of late-type surveys. A close link\nbetween dIs and dEs, first proposed by Lin & Faber (1983), is strengthened by the existence of\nrotationally supported dEs (van Zee et al. 2004a,b), by the residual/past star formation activity\nof dEs observed in UV (Boselli et al. 2005c) or in optical spectra (i.e. VCC1499, Gavazzi et al.\n(2001b); Conselice et al. (2003a)), by the existence of dEs not totally devoid of gas (Conselice et al.\n2003b), by the shape of the faint end of the cluster luminosity functions (Conselice 2002) and by\nthe velocity distribution as broad as that of dwarf irregulars (Conselice et al. 2001).\nIt seems fair to conclude that gravitational perturbations in infalling groups are at the origin\nof local lenticular galaxies. However the process dominating the evolution of gas-rich, late-type\ngalaxies falling-in at the present epoch is the interaction with the hot and dense IGM. The fate\nof late-type galaxies will be slightly different from what it would have been a Gyr ago: they will\nbecome HI-deficient, anemic, rotationally-supported spirals. On long timescales (several crossing\ntimes), because of the lack of gas supply, they will lose angular momentum, somewhat heating their\nstellar disks. They will probably become disk dominated, quiescent systems (3.5), but they will\nnever make it to become real S0s.\nIf this evolutionary picture is correct, we still have to understand at which epoch and under what\nenvironmental conditions the hydrodynamical and the gravitational processes interchanged their\nprevailing role and, among other things, compare it with the inset of the Buchler-Oemler effect.\nThese observational goals are within the reach of last generation ground based optical telescopes\nand of the HST. However we must wait another decade before neutral hydrogen measurements of\ngalaxies at significant z with SKA will shade the final light on the evolutionary processes that took\nplace in clusters of galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 63 \u2013\n6.\n\nAppendix: Characteristic time scales\n\nThe age and the duration of certain interactions, their probability and their frequency can be\nrelatively well quantified from the observations. In this appendix we summarize some time scales\nrelevant to the processes acting on nearby clusters of galaxies:\n\n6.1.\n\nGalaxy revolution time scale: trev\n\nThe time required by a galaxy to make a complete revolution around the rotation axis, trev ,\nis given by the relation:\ntrev = 2\u03c0rgal /\u2206Vgal\n\n(16)\n\nFor normal late-type galaxies, with typical luminosities in the range 8 < logLH < 12 (LH\u2299 ) trev\nranges between 5 \u00d7107 and 3 \u00d7108 yr.\nSome cluster galaxies have asymmetric HI distributions, with most of the gas located on one side of\nthe galaxy, as observed using both interferometers and single dish radiotelescopes21 . Whenever the\natomic gas is partly removed from the disk of the galaxy, the resulting asymmetric HI distribution\nlasts for a few times trev . On longer time scales differential rotation re-distributes uniformly the gas\nover the disk. Thus observing an HI asymmetry implies that the gas removing mechanism has been\nacting since a very short time, or that gas sweeping is an ongoing process: whatever the interaction\nis, it ended no more than trev years ago. Typical galaxies with an asymmetric HI distribution are\nNGC 4654 (Phookun & Mundy 1995) and NGC 4438 (Cayatte et al. 1990) in Virgo, NGC 4848\n(CGCG 160-055), NGC 4921 (CGCG 160-096) in Coma (Gavazzi 1989; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2001),\nUGC 6697 (CGCG 97-087) and CGCG 97-079 in A1367 (Gavazzi 1989; Dickey & Gavazzi 1991).\nThese are marginally HI-deficient galaxies: the ongoing interaction did not have enough time yet\nto remove the majority of the atomic gas.\n\n6.2.\n\nCluster crossing time: tcross\n\nIt is more difficult to date the stripping epoch of HI-deficient galaxies (HI deficiency \u2265 0.3)\nsince several processes can be responsible for gas removal. Ram-pressure, for instance,has a time\nscale comparable with the cluster crossing time tcross .\n\n21\n\nThe HI profiles of asymmetric galaxies with an inclination larger than \u2265 30 degrees are \"one-horned\" instead of\n\"two-horned\" as observed in isolated unperturbed galaxies (Gavazzi 1989)\n\n\f\u2013 64 \u2013\nThe cluster crossing time tcross at the virialization radius Rvir is given by the relation:\n\u221a\ntcross = 2 \u00d7 Rvir /Vgal \u2243 2 \u00d7 Rvir / 3\u03b4Vcluster\n\n(17)\n\nTypical crossing times for galaxies in the clusters Coma, A1367 and Virgo range between 2 and 3\n\u00d7109 yr (see Table 2).\n\n6.3.\n\nDuration of tidal encounters: tenc\n\nTidal encounters have shorter timescales, of the order of tenc \u223c 108 years, the time during\nwhich two galaxies moving at high speed in the potential well of the cluster remain close enough to\nget tidally perturbed. The time scale defining the effective duration of high velocity encounters tenc\nsuch as galaxy-galaxy tidal interactions can be estimated using the relation (Binney & Tremaine\n1987):\ntenc \u2243 max(r(1)gal , r(2)gal , b)/\u2206V\n(18)\nwhere r(1)gal and r(2)gal are the radii of the two galaxies, b their separation at the closest approach\nand \u2206V the relative speed. For galaxies belonging to the three clusters listed in Table 1, for \u2206V\n\u2243 \u03b4Vcluster , tenc \u223c 108 yr. Another very short time-scale.\n\n6.4.\n\nRelaxation time: trelax\n\nThe frequency of encounters, however, is significantly smaller (\u223c 1/trelax ). The relaxation time\ntrelax , the time necessary for a galaxy to have its orbit perturbed by a tidal interaction, is given by\nthe relation:\ntrelax = 0.1 \u00d7 (Dcluster /\u03b4Vcluster ) \u00d7 (Ngal /ln(Ngal )) = 0.2 \u00d7 (Rvir /\u03b4Vcluster ) \u00d7 (Ngal /ln(Ngal ))\n(19)\nwhere Dcluster is the size and \u03b4Vcluster the velocity dispersion of the cluster, and Ngal the number\nof members (Binney & Tremaine 1987; Byrd & Valtonen 1990). The typical relaxation time for the\nthree clusters analyzed in this work can be estimated using the data listed in Table 1 and using a\nrough estimate of Ngal \u223c 1000. They are \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 yr, comparable to the age of the Universe (see\nTable 2).\n\n6.5.\n\nMerging time: tmer\n\nMakino & Hut (1997) studied the merging rate of galaxies of similar mass in clusters. Merging\nprocesses are relatively rare in rich clusters since the probability of a merger is significantly higher\n\n\f\u2013 65 \u2013\nin low speed encounters. If Ngal is the number of galaxies randomly distributed in a cluster of\nradius Dcluster , rh is the half-mass radius of the galaxy, \u2206Vgal and \u03b4Vcluster the galaxy and cluster\nvelocity dispersions, the merging time tmer is given by the relation (Makino & Hut 1997):\n\ntmer \u223c\n\n2000 Dcluster 3 0.1M pc 2 100kms\u22121 4 \u03b4Vcluster 3\n) (\n) (\n) Gyr\n2 ( 1M pc ) (\nrh\n\u2206Vgal\n300kms\u22121\nNgal\n\n(20)\n\nAs shown in Table 2 the time scales for merging of L\u2217 galaxies inside the cluster virial radius are\nrelatively high in Coma, A1367 and Virgo. Given the short length of time of tenc and the low\nfrequency of encounters (\u223c 1/trelax ), it is not surprising that in the whole Virgo cluster only NGC\n4438 shows clear evidence for ongoing tidal interactions. tmerg must have been much shorter in the\npast because of the strong dependence \u223c (1 + z)3 of the density on z.\n\n6.6.\n\nRecombination time: trec\n\nThe presence of asymmetric radio continuum tails, such as those observed in CGCG 97-073 and\nCGCG 97-079 in A1367 (Gavazzi et al. 1995), indicate that the interaction is still ongoing. These\ngalaxies also present long (\u223c 75 kpc) ionized gas tails Gavazzi et al. (2001a). The recombination\ntime trec is given by the relation (Osterbrock 1989):\ntrec = 1/(ne \u2217 \u03b1A )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere ne is the electron density and \u03b1A =4.2 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 . If the gas density is known, and in\nthe hypothesis that the gas is not ionized in situ, this relation can be used, combined with the tail\nlength and the galaxy speed within the cluster, to estimate a lower limit to the first interaction\nresponsible for the formation of the ionized tails. Gavazzi et al. (2001a) estimate that this time\nscale is a few times 107 yrs.\n\nTable 2: The typical time scales for galaxies in the Coma, A1367 and Virgo clusters.\nCluster\n\ntcross\nyr\n\ntrelax\nyr\n\ntmerging\nyr\n\nComa 1.6 109 2.4 1011 6.9 1011\nA1367 1.7 109 7.2 1010 1.7 1012\nV irgo 1.7 109 3.6 1010 3.4 1011\n\n\f\u2013 66 \u2013\n\nFig. 25.- The time behavior of the H\u03b1 to UV flux ratio after an instantaneous burst of star\nformation that occurred at t = 0 of intensity 100 (thick shaded region) and 10 (thin shaded region)\ntimes higher than the continuum formation activity, adapted from Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. (2004).\n6.7.\n\nDating recent starbursts: tstarburst\n\nBeside fitting the SED's continuum from the UV to the near-IR with population synthesis\nmodels (Gavazzi et al. 2002a), several spectral features, combined with population synthesis models,\nare used to estimate the age of the underlying stellar population (see Worthey (1994); Poggianti\n& Barbaro (1996); Bruzual & Charlot (2003)). The debated issue here is which combination of\nindexes should be used to break the age-metallicity degeneracy.\nMany applications of these methods are found in the literature aimed at estimating the age of\ngalaxies in distant clusters. A local application to Coma PSB galaxies is the one by Poggianti et al.\n(2004). Spectral indices can be used to date the age of starbursts. The most generally used are\nthe Balmer emission and underlying absorption lines. The draw-back of these methods is that the\nresults are strongly dependent on the assumed star formation history: significant age difference\narise from the same index if one or more instantaneous or continuum starbursts are assumed.\nA promising clock for dating recent bursts of star formation comes from the H\u03b1 to UV flux ratio,\nassuming that the IMF is universal. The emission at these wavelengths is associated with young\nstars. However, the stars producing the ionizing photons responsible of the H\u03b1 emission are O-B\nstars, younger (t < 4 106 yr) and more massive (m > 10 M\u2299) than the A stars (m \u223c 2-5 M\u2299; t \u223c\n3 108 yr) emitting in the UV (Boselli et al. 2001). After an instantaneous starburst the H\u03b1 to UV\nratio would thus increase on a time scale comparable to the life time of the O-B stars (0< tstarburst\n\u2243 4 106 yr) and decrease on timescales comparable to the age of the UV emitting stars (107 <\ntstarburst \u2243 3 108 yr), as shown in Fig. 25 (adapted from Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. (2004)). However,\n\n\f\u2013 67 \u2013\nthe variation of the H\u03b1 to UV flux ratio is significant only for intense starbursts, where the star\nformation activity increases by at least a factor of 10 with respect to the standard activity. This\npromising technique needs high quality UV and H\u03b1 photometric data, as well as Balmer decrement\nmeasurements and far-IR data necessary for an accurate dust extinction correction (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo\net al. 2004).\nWe wish to thank J.M.
