Three types of flow instabilities of prolate vesicles are\nfound. For small quasi-spherical vesicles \u2013 compared to the average channel width \u2013 perturbation\ntheory predicts a transition from a state with orientational oscillations of a fixed prolate shape to\na state with shape oscillations of symmetrical ellipsoidal or bullet-like shapes with increasing flow\nvelocity. Experimentally, such orientational oscillations are observed during the slow migration\nof a vesicle towards the centerline of the channel. For larger vesicles, mesoscale hydrodynamics\nsimulations and experiments show similar symmetric shape oscillation at reduced volumes V \u2217 &\n0.9. However, for non-spherical vesicles with V \u2217 . 0.9, shapes are found with two symmetric or a\nsingle asymmetric tail.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Soft deformable objects such as liquid droplets, vesicles, and cells show a complex behavior\nunder flow. For example, in simple shear flow, fluid vesicles exhibit tank-treading, tumbling, and swinging (also\ncalled vacillating-breathing, or trembling) motions, depending on parameters such as shear rate, viscosity contrast, and internal volume [1\u20139]. Understanding the flow\nbehavior of lipid vesicles and red blood cells (RBCs) is\nnot only an interesting problem of the hydrodynamics of\ndeformable, thermally fluctuating membranes, but is also\nimportant for medical applications. In microcirculation,\nthe deformation of RBCs reduces the flow resistance of\nmicrovessels. In diseases such as sickle cell anemia, RBCs\nhave reduced deformability and often block microvascular\nflow [10]. Lipid vesicles are considered as a simple model\nof RBCs and also have applications as drug-delivery systems.\nThe recent development of microfluidic techniques [11]\nallows the investigation and manipulation of individual\n(a) E-mail:noguchi@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n(b) E-mail:g.gompper@fz-juelich.de\n(c) E-mail:lothar.schmid@physik.uni-augsburg.de\n(d) E-mail:thomas.franke@physik.uni-augsburg.de\n\ncells and vesicles, e.g. the measurement of the dynamic\npressure drop for single-cell deformation [12], the separation of RBCs from the suspending plasma [13, 14], and\nthe control of oxygen concentration to investigate sickle\ncells [10]. There are many potential applications such as\nblood diagnosis on chip. Under steady flows in homogeneous glass capillaries and rectangular microchannels,\nvesicles [15] and RBCs [14, 16\u201318] deform into a bullet\n(with a flattened rear end) or parachute (with an inside\nbulge at the rear end) shape. Compared to these steadyflow conditions, the vesicle dynamics in time-dependent\nflow is much less explored. Only very recently, phenomena like the wrinkling of vesicles after inversion of an elongational flow [19, 20] or shape oscillation of RBCs [21, 22]\nand fluid vesicles [23] under oscillatory shear flow have\nbeen discovered.\nIn this paper, we propose a structured microchannel\nsystem to study vesicle dynamics. The width of a microchannel is spatially modulated along the channel, so\nthat a flowing vesicle is exposed to an oscillatory elongational flow. We have fabricated such microchannels and\nobserve the time-dependent vesicle deformation via optical microscopy. In parallel, we use perturbation theory\n\np-1\n\n\fH. Noguchi et al.\nfor quasi-spherical vesicles and mesoscale-hydrodynamics\nsimulations for non-spherical vesicles to predict several\nflow instabilities. In particular, we predict for wider channels (compared to the vesicle size) a transition from shape\noscillations of symmetrical bullet-like shapes to orientational oscillations with decreasing flow velocity; for narrower channels, we observe stable shapes with two symmetric or with a single asymmetric tail. Our results\ndemonstrate that structured channels are well suited to\ninvestigate the dynamical behavior of vesicles.\nExperimental Systems and Methods. \u2013 Lipid\nvesicles,\nconsisting\nof\n1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3Phosphocholine (DOPC, Avanti Polar Lipids) with\n0.1mol% fluorescently labeled T-Red DHPE (Texas Red\n1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine,\ntriethylammonium salt, Invitrogen, USA), were prepared\nin aqueous sucrose solution (200mM) by electroformation,\nas described elsewhere [24]. Using this method, many\ngiant unilamellar vesicles with diameter larger than 10\u03bcm\nwere produced. Prior to the experiments, the vesicles were\nintroduced into an slightly hypertonic aqueous glucose\nor sucrose solution. This procedure enables control of\nthe volume-to-surface ratio by inflation and deflation of\nthe vesicles. The vesicles in sucrose solution are perfectly\ndensity matched. The density difference between sucrose\nand glucose solutions at 200mM is \u2206\u03c1/\u03c1 = 0.012, which\nimplies a small buoyancy force.\n\nFig. 1: (Color online) Side view of the channel setup with\nthe reservoirs. The inset shows a top view of the modulated\nchannel. The length of the modulation is Lx = 100\u03bcm.\n\nTheory for quasi-spherical vesicles in modulated\nchannels. \u2013 We consider vesicles which have the same\nviscosity \u03b7 of the outer and inner fluids. Vesicles have\nconstant volume V and constant surface area S, so that\nthe reduced volume V \u2217 and the excess area \u2206S are defined\n2\nby V \u2217 = (RV /RS )3 = (1 + \u2206S /4\u03c0)\u22123/2 and \u2206S = S/RV\n\u2212\n4\u03c0, where RV = (3V /4\u03c0)1/3 and RS = (S/4\u03c0)1/2 .\nFirst, we derive an analytical description of the flow behavior of small quasi-spherical vesicles with \u2206S \u226a 1, based\non the theory for linear flows [2, 5\u20137, 20]. The microchannel has a constant height Lz and a periodically modulated\nwidth with walls at \u00b1hy (x), where\n\nMicrochannels were fabricated by soft lithography [30].\n\u0010 2\u03c0x \u0011o\nLy n\nThe structure of an AutoCAD designed mask was\n1 + ay cos\n.\n(1)\nhy (x) =\n2\nLx\ntransferred by illumination to a photoresist (SU-8, microresist, Berlin), which serves as a master to cast\nHere, Lx is the periodicity length along the channel (see\npoly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) replicas.

The force sl,m (xG ) is given by\nsl,m (xG ) = (al,m + Bl bl,m )Ly /RV vm [2, 7, 20]. Here, Bl =\n1/(2l2 +2l\u22121), and al,m and bl,m are the spherical harmonics expansion of vr (r) and RV \u2202vr (r)/\u2202r at |r \u2212 rG | = RV ,\nrespectively, where vr (r) is the radial components of the\nflow field v(r) in the absence of the vesicle.

We consider a\nvesicle with a small excess area \u2206S = 0.1 (corresponding\nto V \u2217 = 0.988), where it is sufficient to take into account\nl = 2, 3 modes, and a channel with Ly = Lz = 20RV and\nvarious Lx and ay .\nIn fast flow, where flow forces dominate and the reduced\nbending rigidity is small, \u03ba\u2217 \u226a 1, the analysis of Eq. (4)\nshows that the shape is mirror symmetric with respect\nto both xz and xy planes, and that the vesicle lengths\nlx and ly oscillate (see Fig. 2). The flow elongates the\nvesicle in the y and x direction for \u2212Lx/2 < x < 0 and\n0 < x < Lx /2, respectively. In the regime \u03ba\u2217 \u226a 1, the\nextremal elongations are determined by the balance of the\nflow forces, sl,m (xG ), and the area constraint. The forces\n|s2,2 (xG )| and |s3,3 (xG )| have maxima at xG = \u00b10.38Lx\nand xG = \u00b1Lx/2 for ay = 0.5, respectively. The resulting\npositions of extremal elongations are found to be close to\nxG = 0 and xG = Lx /2 (see Fig. 2(b)).\nIn contrast, in slow flow with \u03ba\u2217 \u226b 1, the vesicle is\npredicted not to change its shape, but to display a periodic\noscillation of its orientation. The tilt angle \u03b8 oscillates\naround \u03c0/4 (or \u2212\u03c0/4 depending on initial positions), see\nsnapshot in Fig. 2(a). Thus, a symmetry breaking occurs\nwith decreasing flow velocity.\nBoth types of vesicle motions are limit cycles. A sharp\nbut continuous transition between these two motions occurs at a critical reduced bending rigidity \u03ba\u2217c , where the\ntilt angle \u03b8 vanishes (see Fig. 2(a)). The critical value\n\u03ba\u2217c increases with increasing corrugation ay of the channel, but is almost independent of Lx for Lx /Ly > 2 (see\nFig. 2(c)).

A dynamically-triangulated surface model\nfor the membrane [32] is combined with a particle-based\nmesoscale simulation technique - multi-particle collision\ndynamics (MPC) [33\u201335] - for the embedding fluid.

In this case, hydrodynamic\ninteractions between the vesicle and wall are not negligible.

[4, 18]. In MPC,\nthe fluid is described by Ns point-like particles of mass\nms . After free streaming of every particle for a time\nstep \u2206t, the fluid particles collide in cubic boxes of lattice constant a = Lx /16, which is also the mean length\nbetween \u221a\nmembrane vertices. We use the fluid viscosity\n\u03b7 = 550 ms kB T /a2 (with number\ndensity n = 100a\u22123\np\nand the time step \u2206t = 0.01a ms /kB T ), corresponding\nto low Reynolds numbers, to simulate experimental conditions. We study vesicles with bending rigidity \u03ba = 20kB T\nwhere kB T is the thermal energy. The flow velocity is\nchosen to be vm \u03c4 /Ly = 170(RV /Ly )3 for a channel with\nLy = Lz = Lx /2, corresponding to a slow vesicle relaxation compared to the passage time through a channel segment. For vesicles with RS /Ly = 0.36 and RS /Ly = 0.46\nat V \u2217 = 0.9, the reduced bending rigidity is \u03ba\u2217 = 0.14\nand \u03ba\u2217 = 0.07, respectively. In this regime, the vesicle\ndynamics is not very sensitive to \u03ba\u2217 .\n\nfor \u2212Lx/2 < x \u2264 0 and 0 < x \u2264 Lx /2, respectively.\nTwo types of channels are used, which are characterized\nby Ly = 50\u03bcm, ay = 0.2 and Ly = 75\u03bcm, ay = 0.33\n(as well as Lz = 50\u03bcm and Lx = 100\u03bcm). The glucose\nand sucrose solutions are used for the experiments with\nthe narrower and wider channels, respectively. Typical\nexperimental flow velocities are in the range vm = 10 \u2013\n100\u03bcm/s.\nFirst, we describe the dynamics in the wider channel\n(Ly = 75\u03bcm). Experimental and simulation results for\nthe shape deformation are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. As expected, the vesicles change their shapes periodically. For\nV \u2217 & 0.9, vesicle shapes vary continuously between an almost ellipsoidal (in the narrow part of the channel) and a\ncone-like (in the wide part of the channel) bullet shape, see\nFig. 3. This is in contrast to the behavior for unbounded\nsteady Poiseuille flow, where perturbation theory predicts\na coexistence between bullet- and parachute-like shapes at\nthe center line [29]. The amplitudes and phases of the deformations in the x- and y-directions (see Fig. 4) agree well\nbetween simulations and experiments, while very little deformation is seen in the z-direction. The small difference\nof amplitudes between the experiment and simulation is\nprobably due to the somewhat different values of the reduced volume and radius of the vesicle, since an accurate\nexperimental estimation is difficult (because the length in\nthe z direction could not be measured). The dynamics\nalso agrees qualitatively with the theoretical predictions\nfor quasi-spherical vesicles, compare Fig. 2, although the\nparameters are outside the range of validity of the theo-\n\np-4\n\n\fDynamics of Fluid Vesicles in Flow through Structured Microchannels\n\ne1\n\n0.3\n\ns1\n\ns2\n\ne2\ne1\n\n\u2206l /<l >\n\n0.2\n\nly\n\ns4\ne4\n\ne3\ns3\n\n0.1\n\ne2\n0\n\n0.8\n\nlx\nV*\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03b8/\u03c0\n\n0.25\n\n0\n0\n\nFig. 5: (Color online) Normalized oscillation amplitudes \u2206l/hli\nin the x (red) and y (blue) directions.

If the\nvesicle size is larger than the smallest channel width Lmin\ny ,\nvesicles can not flow through the channel without a shape\ndeformation. Thus, with decreasing flow velocity, the dynamics changes from shape oscillations to a trapped state\n[36] (instead of the orientational oscillation). The tran\u2217\n\u2217\nsition velocity depends on RS /Lmin\ny , V , and \u03ba . A microchannel with a strong variation of channel width (for\ninstance the channel in Fig. 6(a) of Ref. [14]), is suitable\nfor a study of this trapped-escape transition.\nSummary. \u2013 We have studied the dynamics of vesicles in structured microchannels, both theoretically and\nexperimentally. For large reduced volumes, the vesicles\nperiodically change their shape (large flow rates) or their\norientation (small flow rates), depending also on the channel geometry. For smaller reduced volumes, we find a novel\nshape with a long asymmetric tail. The good agreement\nof theoretical and experimental results shows that flow of\nvesicle suspensions in complex flow geometries can now be\nunderstood quantitatively.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nWe acknowledge support of this work through the DFG\npriority program \"Nano- and Microfluidics\" (SPP 1164)\nand the \"Nanosystems Initiative Munich\" (NIM).\n\n[15] Vitkova V., Mader M. and Podgorski T., Europhys.\nLett., 68 (2004) 398.\n[16] Tsukada K., Sekizuka E., Oshio C. and Minamitani\nH., Microvasc.
