INTRODUCTION\n\nThe phenomenon of triaxiality has remained of central\nimportance to our understanding of galaxy dynamics since\nthe demonstration by Schwarzschild (1979) of the existence of self-consistent triaxial equilibria. Schwarzschild's\nmodels had large, constant-density cores and the majority of the orbits were regular, respecting three integrals of\nthe motion. But the realization that the central densities\nof elliptical galaxies and bulges are very high (Crane et\nal. 1993), and that supermassive black holes are generic\ncomponents of galaxies (Kormendy & Richstone 1995),\nhas modified somewhat our ideas about the persistence\nof triaxiality. A central black hole can destroy triaxiality\non large scales by rendering the center-filling box orbits\nstochastic (Gerhard & Binney 1985). Evolution to globally axisymmetric shapes can occur in just a few crossing times if the black hole contains of order 10\u22122 of the\ngalaxy's mass (Merritt & Quinlan 1998; Sellwood 2001).\nLess is known about the possibility of maintaining triaxial shapes at the very centers of galaxies, where the gravitational force is contributed roughly equally by the stars\nand by the nuclear black hole. Regular orbits, both boxlike and tube-like, exist in this region (Merritt & Valluri\n1999; Sambhus & Sridhar 2000; Poon & Merritt 2001, Paper I) but the box-like orbits (the \"pyramids\") have shapes\nthat are generally contrary to the figure elongation, making them less useful than classical box orbits for maintaining a triaxial shape. Furthermore the pyramid orbits\ndisappear within the \"zone of chaos,\" which begins at a\nradius where the enclosed stellar mass is a few times that\nof the black hole (Paper I), roughly 102 pc in a typical\nbright elliptical galaxy.\nHere we demonstrate that triaxial equilibria do in fact\nexist in the vicinity of the black hole. We first (\u00a72) use\nSchwarzschild's technique to construct self-consistent superpositions of orbits computed in a fixed triaxial potential representing the stars and a central point mass. We\nthen (\u00a73) test the long-term stability of the models by using an N -body code to advance them forward in time; we\n\n2. SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTIONS\n\nWe model the stellar nucleus as a triaxial spheroid with\na power-law dependence of density on radius,\n\u03c1\u22c6 = \u03c1\u25e6 m\u2212\u03b3 ,\n(1a)\nr\n2\n2\n2\ny\nz\nx\n+ 2 + 2,\n(1b)\nm=\n2\na\nb\nc\ninside of some surface m = mout discussed below. We took\n\u03b3 = 1 or 2; these values correspond roughly to the density\nprofiles observed at the centers of bright and faint elliptical galaxies, respectively (Gebhardt et al. 1996).\nThe\ntriaxiality T is defined as\na2 \u2212 b 2\n.\n(2)\na2 \u2212 c2\nWe chose a = 1.0, b = 0.79, c = 0.5 for both models, corresponding to T = 0.5, \"maximal\" triaxiality. The central\nblack hole is represented by a point mass with Mbh = 1.\nExpressions for the gravitational potential and forces corresponding to this mass model are given in Paper I.\nAlthough our mass model for the stars is scale-free, the\npresence of the black hole imposes a scale. We identify\nthree characteristic radii associated with the black hole.\nAt a radius of rg , the enclosed mass in stars (defined as\nthe mass within an equidensity surface which intersects\nthe x-axis at x = rg ) is equal to that of the black hole.\nIn real galaxies, rg is typically a factor of \u223c a few greater\nthan the \"sphere of influence\" rh , where\n\u0013\u22122\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nGMbh\n\u03c3\u2217\nMbh\nrh \u2261\n(3)\n\u2248 10.8 pc\n\u03c3\u22172\n108 M\u2299\n200 km s\u22121\nT \u2261\n\n1\n\ndepends on the stellar velocity dispersion \u03c3\u2217 The third\nfiducial radius is rch , the radius at which the character of\n\n\f2\nthe box-like orbits undergoes a sudden transition to chaos\nin triaxial potentials. Table 1 gives values of rg and rch for\nour two mass models; values of rch are approximate and\nare taken from Paper I. Table 1 also gives values of the\ndynamical times at rg and rch , defined as the period of a\ncircular orbit of the same energy in the equivalent spherical\npotential, defined to have a scale length aave = (abc)1/3 .\nThe enclosed stellar mass within rch is about 3Mbh for\n\u03b3 = 1 and 6Mbh for \u03b3 = 2.\nTable 1\n\nrg\nTD (rg )\nrch\nTD (rch )\nmout\nTD (mout )\n\n\u03b3=1\n0.64\n0.98\n1.1\n1.8\n5.6\n5.1\n\n\u03b3=2\n0.20\n0.17\n1.3\n1.5\n3.8\n4.6\n\nAny numerical realization of a stellar system must have\nan outer boundary. Our goal was to test self-consistency\nout to a radius of at least rch , corresponding to \u223c 2rg\nfor \u03b3 = 1 and \u223c 6rg for \u03b3 = 2. We therefore chose\nthe outer surface of our mass model, m = mout , to be\nlarge enough that almost all of the density at rch in a\nreal galaxy would be contributed by orbits with apocenters below this surface. In order to estimate mout , the\nisotropic distribution functions corresponding to a spherical galaxy with the density law of equation (1), \u03b3 = {1, 2},\nand a central point mass were computed and transformed\nto F (rapo ; r), the distribution of apocentric radii rapo of\norbits passing through r. For \u03b3 = 1, we found that orbits\nwith rapo <\n\u223c 5rch contribute \u223c 70% of the density at rch .\nFor \u03b3 = 2, setting rapo \u2248 3rch is sufficient to give \u223c 75%\nof the density at rch . (rch in the spherical models was\ndefined as the radius containing the same mass as in the\ntriaxial models.) Our corresponding choices for mout are\ngiven in Table 1.\nWe followed standard procedures for constructing the\nSchwarzschild solutions (Schwarzschild 1993; Merritt &\nFridman 1996). The mass model within mout was divided\ninto 64 equidensity shells and each shell was divided into\n48 cells per octant, for a total of 3072 cells. Shells were\nmore closely spaced near the center (Figure 1). Orbits\nwere computed in two initial condition spaces: stationary\nstart space, which yields box-like orbits, and X \u2212 Z start\nspace, which yields mostly tube orbits. Orbital energies\nwere selected from a grid of 42(52) values for \u03b3 = 1(2),\ndefined as the energies of equipotential surfaces that were\nspaced similarly in radius to the equidensity shells. The\noutermost energy shell intersected the x axis at x = mout\nfor both models. Orbits were integrated for 100 dynamical times, as defined above, and their contributions to the\nmasses in the cells were recorded. In order to distinguish\nregular from stochastic trajectories, the largest Liapunov\nexponent was computed for each orbit. For \u03b3 = 1, the\ntotal number of orbits integrated was 18144 of which 9751\nwere found to be regular. For \u03b3 = 2, the numbers were\n22464 and 15048 respectively. Orbital weights that reproduced the masses in the 3072 cells were found via quadratic\nprogramming (e.g. Dejonghe 1989).\n\nFig. 1.- Cumulative mass fractions F contributed by different\nkinds of orbits to different shells of the triaxial models. Box-like\norbits are green, tube orbits (both z- and x-tubes) are orange, and\nchaotic orbits are purple. Higher energies are indicated via darker\nshades; the color bar relates the shade to the radius of the equipotential surface, as explained in the text. Numbers below the color\nbar indicate radii where the equidensity shells intersect the x-axis.\n(a), (c) correspond to solutions with only regular orbits for \u03b3 = 1, 2\nrespectively. (b), (d) correspond to solutions with both regular and\nchaotic orbits.\n\nAs expected, orbital superpositions that exactly reproduced the cell masses in all of the cells, including the outermost ones, could not be found since only a few orbits\nvisit the outer shells. We were able to find \"exact\" solutions (solutions which precisely reproduced the densities in\na subset of cells) by relaxing the constraints in a number of\nways; for instance, by eliminating the angular constraints\non the outermost shells (forcing only the integrated shell\nmass to be fit), or by ignoring the outer cells entirely when\nimposing the constraints. For example, when only regular\norbits were included, \"exact\" solutions could be found for\n\u03b3 = 1 for all cells within shell 51, corresponding to a radius of \u223c 3.2. This radius is substantially greater than rch\n(Table 1).\nWhen these \"exact\" solutions were advanced forward\nin time, as described below, they were found to exhibit\nsignificant evolution at large radii, due to the fact that\nthe model's density was not correctly reproduced in the\noutermost cells. We therefore constructed new solutions\nwhich were not \"exact,\" but which were constrained to reproduce the densities in all cells within mout with as high\nan accuracy as possible. Such solutions exhibited smaller\nfractional errors in the innermost cells (r <\n\u223c rch ) than in\nthe outer ones. Models constructed in this way were found\nto evolve much less than the \"exact\" solutions and provide\nthe basis for the discussion below.\n\n\fTriaxial Nuclei\n\n3\n\nTable 2\n\n\u03b3 = 1 : (regular)\nr < 0.5\nr < 1.0\nr < 1.5\n\u03b3 = 1 : (all)\nr < 0.5\nr < 1.0\nr < 1.5\n\u03b3 = 2 : (regular)\nr < 0.4\nr < 0.8\nr < 1.2\n\u03b3 = 2 : (all)\nr < 0.4\nr < 0.8\nr < 1.2\n\nz-tubes\n\nx-tubes\n\npyramids\n\nchaotic\n\n0.61\n0.56\n0.53\n\n0.10\n0.08\n0.07\n\n0.29\n0.37\n0.40\n\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.09\n0.10\n0.10\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.26\n0.25\n0.25\n\n0.61\n0.62\n0.63\n\n0.75\n0.73\n0.73\n\n0.10\n0.13\n0.13\n\n0.15\n0.14\n0.13\n\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n\n0.45\n0.44\n0.42\n\n0.45\n0.47\n0.49\n\nThe orbital content of the latter solutions is described\nin Figure 1 and Table 2. We constructed two types of solution for each \u03b3: solutions in which only regular orbits were\nused; and solutions in which all orbits (regular and chaotic)\nwere provided to the Schwarzschild algorithm. The dominant family of orbits in the models containing only regular\ntrajectories was found to be the z-tubes, orbits which circulate about the short axis of the figure. Plots of the\nindividual orbits used in the solutions confirm that many\nof the z-tubes have the correct shape for reproducing the\ntriaxial figure, being more elongated in x (the long axis)\nthan in y (the intermediate axis). Most of the remaining contribution to the density of the regular nuclei was\nfound to come from pyramid orbits and high-energy box\norbits in the \u03b3 = 1 model, while for \u03b3 = 2, roughly equal\ncontributions came from pyramid orbits and from the xtubes. (See Paper I, Figure 1 for illustrations of the various orbit families.) The most heavily occupied pyramid\norbits had shapes similar to \"saucer\" orbits, z-tubes associated with a 2 : 1 resonance (Paper I, Figure 1c); both\nmodels contained roughly equal numbers of saucers and\npyramids. High-energy box-like orbits are more important in the \u03b3 = 1 case than in the \u03b3 = 2 case, because: (1)\nhigh-energy tube orbits in the \u03b3 = 1 model are elongated\nopposite to the figure; (2) most of the high-energy regular\nbox orbits in the \u03b3 = 2 model are bananas, which are not\nvery useful for filling the outermost shells.\nIn the models constructed using both regular and\nchaotic trajectories, the number of stars on chaotic orbits\nis surprisingly high: \u223c 60% for \u03b3 = 1 and \u223c 45% for \u03b3 = 2\nat all radii. Plots of the most highly populated chaotic orbits suggest that they have reached a nearly steady state\nin a time-averaged sense, filling the volume defined by the\nequipotential surface corresponding to their energy. Stationary chaotic building blocks like these have been used\nbefore when constructing triaxial models (e.g. Merritt &\nFridman 1996) but no published triaxial models have contained nearly so large fraction of stars on chaotic orbits.\n\nFig. 2.- Evolution of the N -body axis ratios; a \u2261 1. r defines\nthe longest dimension of the ellipsoid within which the axis ratios\nwere determined, using the algorithm described in the text. TD is\nthe dynamical time at this radius. Black (red) curves correspond to\nsolutions where only regular (both regular and chaotic) orbits were\nused.\n\n3. N-BODY MODELS\n\nWe verified that our orbital superpositions correspond to\ntrue equilibria by realizing them as N -body models and integrating them forward in time in the gravitational potential computed from the N bodies themselves and from the\npoint mass representing the black hole. Initial conditions\nwere prepared by re-integrating all orbits with nonzero occupation numbers. The position and velocity of each trajectory were recorded at fixed time intervals; the length of\neach integration was determined by the orbit's occupation\nnumber. The sense of rotation of the tube orbits was chosen randomly such that the mean motion was everywhere\nzero. The number of particles was 2.42 \u00d7 106 for \u03b3 = 1\nand 2.19 \u00d7 105 for \u03b3 = 2; a smaller N was chosen for \u03b3 = 2\nsince the N -body integrations were slower for the more\ncondensed model.\nThe initial conditions were then advanced in time using the N -body code GADGET (Springel, Yoshida & White\n2001), a parallel tree code with variable time steps. The interparticle softening length was chosen to be 0.005 (0.003)\nfor \u03b3 = 1 (2). Figure 2 shows the evolution of the axis\nratios of the models, computed using the iterative proce-\n\n\f4\ndure described by Dubinski & Carlberg (1991). The axis\nratios fluctuate with time, but the models retain their triaxial figures very well over many dynamical times. No\nsignficant evolution was seen in the radial distribution of\nmatter.\n\nFig. 3.- Line-of-sight velocities of the rotating regular models\ndescribed in the text, as seen along the y-axis. Contours of positive\n(negative) velocity are represented by full (dotted) lines.\n\n4. OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES\n\nTwo observational signatures of triaxiality are isophote\ntwists, and kinematic misalignments. Isophote twists require a variation with radius of the intrinsic axis ratios,\nwhich is not a feature of our models. Kinematic misalignments occur whenever the intrinsic angular momentum\nvector does not coincide with the minor axis of the figure,\nand are generic features of triaxial systems when both the\nshort- and long-axis tube orbits are populated (e.g. Franx,\nIllingworth & de Zeeuw 1991).\nWe illustrate the possibility of kinematic misalignments\nin our models in Figure 3. Line-of-sight velocity contours\nare plotted for regular models after a fraction of the xand z-tubes were reversed, giving the models net rotation\nabout both the long and short axes. For \u03b3 = 1, all x-tubes\nin Figure 3 rotate in the same sense while 60% of the ztubes at each energy rotate in one sense and the remaining\n40% in the other. For \u03b3 = 2, all x-tubes rotate in the same\nsense around the x axis and all z-tubes rotate in the same\nsense around the z-axis. Rotation of the projected models\nalong the apparent minor axis of the figure (\"minor-axis\nrotation\") is apparent.\n\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that long-lived triaxial configurations\nare possible for nuclei containing black holes, whether constructed purely from regular orbits, or from a combination\nof regular and chaotic orbits. The latter solutions are remarkable given the large fraction of the mass on chaotic\norbits, of order 50% or more (Table 2). Such solutions\nviolate Jeans's theorem in its standard form (e.g. Binney & Tremaine 1987) but are consistent with a generalized Jeans's theorem (Merritt 1999) if we assume that\nthe chaotic building blocks are \"fully mixed,\" that is, that\nthey approximate a uniform population of the accessible\nphase space. This appears to be the case based on visual\ninspection of the time-averaged chaotic trajectories. While\na sudden onset of chaos can effectively destroy triaxiality\nin models containing a large population of regular box orbits (Merritt & Quinlan 1998; Sellwood 2001), our work\nshows that at least the central parts of galaxies containing\nblack holes can remain triaxial even when dominated by\nchaotic orbits.\nGalaxy nuclei are typically modelled as oblate axisymmetric systems when deriving black hole masses from\nstellar-kinematical data (e.g. van der Marel et al. 1998;\nJoseph et al. 2001). Modelling a triaxial nucleus as axisymmetric will generally lead to biassed estimates of Mbh ;\nfor instance, if an elongated bar is viewed end-on, the velocity field can mimic that produced by a black hole even\nin the absence of a central mass concentration (Gerhard\n1988). The high-resolution data on which such mass estimates are based are usually obtained from single slits,\nmaking it difficult to rule out triaxial shapes using information like that in Figure 3.\nAxisymmetry is typically also assumed when deriving\nrates of interaction of stars with nuclear black holes (e.g.\nSyer & Ulmer 1999; Magorrian & Tremaine 1999). The\ntriaxial models which we constructed from regular orbits\nwere dominated by z-tubes (Table 2), similar to the tube\norbits that populate an oblate spheroid. The rate of capture or destruction of stars by the black hole in these\nmodels would be similar to the rates in an axisymmetric nucleus. However the dominance of chaotic orbits in\nour second set of solutions implies a qualitatively different\nsort of behavior: the \"loss cone\" of stars captured by the\nblack hole would be refilled on a time scale determined by\nthe frequency of near-center passages of the chaotic orbits,\nrather than by two-body scattering.\nThis work was supported by NSF grants AST 9617088 and 00-71099 and by NASA grants NAG5-6037 and\nNAG5-9046 to DM.\n\nREFERENCES\nBinney, J. & Tremaine, S. 1987, Galactic Dynamics (Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press)\nCrane, P. et al. 1993, AJ, 106, 1371\nDejonghe, H. 1989, ApJ, 343, 113\nDubinski, J. & Carlberg, R. 1991, ApJ, 378, 496\nGebhardt, K. et al. 1996, AJ, 112, 105\nGerhard, O.
