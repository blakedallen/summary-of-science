We establish a connection between our resolutions\nand resolutions of singularities of closure of conjugacy classes in classical Lie\nalgebras.\n\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to present canonical resolutions of singularities of\ncertain cone varieties arising naturally in invariant theory. Examples of such cone\nvarieties are provided by the so-called null cones which are the zero locus of the On\n(or Spn ) invariant polynomials on Mn,m , where Mn,m denotes the space of n \u00d7 m\ncomplex matrices (cf. e.g. [H]). Another example is the null cone for general\nlinear groups. Our construction resembles the celebrated Springer resolution of\nthe nilpotent variety in a complex semisimple Lie algebra which plays a vital role\nin representation theory and geometry (cf. [CG]).\nIt turns out that the cone varieties studied here include as special cases the\nvariety Z constructed in [KP1, KP2] associated to two-column partitions. The\nKraft-Procesi variety Z is a complete intersection whose quotient under certain\ngroup coincide with the closure of a nilpotent conjugacy class in classical Lie algebras. It is a very interesting problem to construct a canonical resolution of\nsingularities of Z in general. We establish relations between our resolutions of\nsingularities and those for closure of conjugacy classes associated to two-column\npartitions. In the general linear Lie algebra case, we find more than one canonical\nresolution of singularities of null cones and of closure of conjugacy classes.\n\u2217\n\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 14L35, 22G.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nWeiqiang Wang\n\nWe mention in passing that the present work grows out of an attempt to generalize the geometric construction of (gln , glm )-duality [W] in the spirit of [CG] to\nother Howe duality [H].\nThe paper is divided into two sections. In Sect. 1 we present resolutions of\nsingularities of null cones in the On and Spn cases, and establish connections with\nresolutions of singularities of closure of conjugacy classes. In Sect. 2 we treat the\nanalog of Sect. 1 for the general linear Lie algebras.\n\n1\n\nNull cones associated to On and Spn\n\nDenote by GLn , On , and Sp2n the complex general linear group, orthogonal group,\nand the symplectic group respectively. Denote by Mn,m the set of all complex n\u00d7m\nmatrices.\n\n1.1\n\nThe orthogonal setup\n\nLet V be a vector space of complex dimension n with a non-degenerate symmetric\nbilinear form. We identify V with Cn endowed with the standard symmetric bilinear\nform\nn\n(u, v) =\n\nX\n\nui vi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere u, v denote the n-tuples (u1 , . . . , un ) and (v1 , . . . , vn ).\nFor convenience, we can identify Mn,m with the direct sum (Cn )m of m copies\nof Cn . We may write a typical element of (Cn )m as an m-tuple:\nA = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ),\n\nvj \u2208 Cn .\n\nWe define a set of quadratic polynomials \u03be \u0303ij = \u03be \u0303ji , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m on (Cn )m by\n\u03be \u0303ij (v) = (vi , vj ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nvai vaj .\n\na=1\n\nRemark 1 The First Fundamental Theorem for On (cf. [H]) says that the polynomials \u03be \u0303ij = \u03be \u0303ji , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, generate the algebra of On invariant polynomials\non (Cn )m .\nWe identify the space S 2 (Cm ) of second symmetric tensors as the space of\nsymmetric m \u00d7 m matrices. Define a map\nQ : Mn,m \u2212\u2192 S 2 (Cm )\nT 7\u2192 T t T.\nHere T t denotes the transpose of T . By identifying Mn,m with (Cn )m , we can\nequivalently define Q(T ) as the m \u00d7 m symmetric matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is\nequal to \u03be \u0303ij .\n\n\fResolution of null cones\n\n1.2\n\n3\n\nThe symplectic setup\n\nLet V be a vector space of complex dimension n with a non-degenerate symplectic\n(i.e. anti-symmetric) bilinear form. It is well known that n has to be an even\nnumber, say 2p. We identify V with Cn endowed with the following standard\nsymplectic bilinear form\n(v, v \u2032 ) =\n\nn/2\nX\n\n(xj yj\u2032 \u2212 yj x\u2032j ).\n\nj=1\n\nHere v = (x, y) and v \u2032 = (x\u2032 , y \u2032) are elements of C2p , expressed as 2-tuples of\nelements of Cp .\nWe identify Mn,m with the direct sum (Cn )m of m copies of Cn as before. We\nmay write a typical element of (Cn )m as an m-tuple:\nA = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ),\n\nvj \u2208 Cn .\n\nWe define a set of quadratic polynomials \u03be\u02c7ij = \u2212\u03be\u02c7ji , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m on (Cn )m by\n\u03be \u0303ij (v) = (vi , vj ).\nRemark 2 The First Fundamental Theorem for Spn (cf. [H]) says that the polynomials \u03be\u02c7ij = \u2212\u03be\u02c7ji , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, generate the algebra of Spn invariant polynomials\non (Cn )m .\nWe identify the space \u039b2 (Cm ) of second anti-symmetric tensors in Cm as the\nspace of anti-symmetric m \u00d7 m matrices. Denote by\nJ=\n\n\"\n\n0 Ip\n\u2212Ip 0\n\n#\n\n,\n\nwhere Ip denotes the identity p \u00d7 p matrix. Define a map\nQsp : Mn,m \u2212\u2192 \u039b2 (Cm )\nT 7\u2192 T t JT.\nWe also write Qsp as Q when no ambiguity arises. By identifying Mn,m with (Cn )m ,\nwe can equivalently define Q(T ) as the m\u00d7m anti-symmetric matrix whose (i, j)-th\nentry equal to \u03be\u02c7ij .\n\n1.3\n\nA resolution of singularities of N CQ\n\nLet V be a vector space of complex dimension n with a nondegenerate bilinear\nform, either symmetric or anti-symmetric. Let G(V ) be the isometry group of the\n\n\f4\n\nWeiqiang Wang\n\nform, which is On in symmetric case and Spn in anti-symmetric case. Let g(V ) be\nits Lie algebra.\nGiven A in S 2 (Cm ) (resp. \u039b2 (Cm )), its inverse image Q\u22121 (A) under the map\nQ is referred to as the fiber of Q over A. Of particular interest is the fiber over\n0 (cf. [H]), which we will refer to as the null cone (since it is obviously preserved\nby scalar dilations) and denote by N CQ. Equivalently, the variety N CQ is the set\nof n \u00d7 m matrices on which all G(V ) invariant polynomials on Mn,m take value 0.\nOften we will think of Mn,m as the space Hom(Cm , V ) of all linear maps from Cm\nto V (or Cn ). An element in N CQ is called a null mapping. We easily have\nQ(gT ) = Q(T ), T \u2208 Mn,m , g \u2208 G(V ),\nQ(T h) = ht Q(T )h, h \u2208 GLm .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nRemark 3 It follows from Eqs. (1) and (2) that G(V ) acts on N CQ and this\naction commutes with the action of GLm . The space of regular functions on N CQ,\nunder the induced action of G(V ) \u00d7 GLm , has a beautiful decomposition into\nG(V ) \u00d7 GLm -modules (cf. [H]).\nA subspace of V is called isotropic if any two vectors in the subspace are\northogonal to each other with respect to the corresponding bilinear form. We\nobserve that T \u2208 Mn,m = Hom(Cm , V ) is a null mapping if and only if the image of\nT , denoted by IT , form an isotropic subspace of Cn . Denote by Jr (V ) the set of all\nr-dimensional isotropic subspaces of V . The set Jr (V ) is nonempty if and only if\nr \u2264 n/2. It is well known that G(V ) acts on Jr (V ) transitively (cf. [H], Appendix\n3). The dimension of Jr (V ) (r \u2264 n/2) can be calculated to be r(2n \u2212 3r \u2212 1)/2.\nNote that the null cone N CQ is a singular variety defined in terms of a finite\nset of quadratic equations. The first goal of this paper is to present a canonical\nresolution of singularities of N CQ. Our construction is reminiscent of the Springer\nresolution of singularities of the nilpotent cone in a complex semisimple Lie algebra\n(cf. e.g. [CG]).\nSet r = min(m, [n/2]) from now on, where [n/2] denotes the integer closest to\nand no larger than n/2. We introduce the following variety\n^\nN\nCQ = {(T, U) \u2208 N CQ \u00d7 Jr (V ) | IT \u2282 U}.\n\nWe have the following projection maps:\n^\nN\nCQ\n\n\u03bc0 \u0582\nN CQ\n\n\u0581 \u03c00\nJr (V )\n\n^\nThe diagram is On \u00d7 GLm -equivariant, where GLm acts trivially on N\nCQ and\n^\nJr (V ). \u03bc0 is proper since N CQ \u2282 N CQ \u00d7 Jr (V ) and Jr (V ) is compact. It is easy\nto see that \u03c00 and \u03bc0 are both surjective.\n\n\fResolution of null cones\n\n5\n\nDenote by TJ the tautological bundle over Jr (V ):\nTJ = {(u, U) \u2208 V \u00d7 Jr (V ) | u \u2208 U}.\nDenote by Cr the rank r trivial bundle over Jr (V ). Given U \u2208 Jr (V ), the fiber of\n\u03c00 over U is canonically identified with Hom(Cm , U). Thus we have\n^\ndim N\nCQ = mr + dim Jr (V )\n= mr + r(2n \u2212 3r \u2212 1)/2\n= r(2m + 2n \u2212 3r \u2212 1)/2.\n^\nThis proves the following characterization of N\nCQ.\n^\nProposition 1 The variety N\nCQ is isomorphic to the tensor product T aut\u2297 Cm of\nvector bundles T aut and Cm over the variety Jr (V ) such that the following diagram\ncommutes:\nN\n^\n\u223c\nN\nCQ\nTJ Cm\n=\n\u03c00 \u0581\n\u0582\nJr (V )\n^\nIn particular, N\nCQ is a smooth variety of dimension r(2m + 2n \u2212 3r \u2212 1)/2, where\nr = min(m, [n/2]).\n\n^\nTheorem 1 The map \u03bc0 : N\nCQ \u2212\u2192 N CQ is a resolution of singularities.\n\nProof. It is clear that the set N CQ0 of all null mappings of maximal rank which is\nequal to r = min(m, [n/2]) is a Zariski-open subvariety of N CQ. Given T \u2208 N CQ0\nthere exists a unique U \u2208 Jr (V ) containing IT , namely IT itself. Thus the map\n^\n\u03bc0 : N\nCQ \u2212\u2192 N CQ over an open set \u03bc\u22121\n0 (N CQ0 ) is one-to-one. Together with\n^\nthe smoothness of N\nCQ provided by Proposition 1, we conclude the proof.\n\u2737\nRemark 4 In the case n \u2265 2m and so r = m, we easily see that the map Q maps\nsurjectively to the space Symm of m \u00d7 m symmetric matrices, and it is submersive\nat any point T in N CQ0 . It follows that\ndim N CQ = dim Mn,m \u2212 dim Symm\n^\n= nm \u2212 (m2 + m)/2 = dim N\nCQ.\n\nThis of course was also implied by Theorem 1.\nIt is known that Jr (V ) is disconnected if and only if we are in the orthogonal\ncase and n = 2m (which implies r = m) (cf. [H], Appendix 2). Let us assume\nthat we are in such a case first of all, and so Jr (V ) has two smooth connected\n\n\f6\n\nWeiqiang Wang\n\n^\ncomponents (cf. [H]). It follows by Proposition 1 that N\nCQ also has two smooth\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n^\n^\nconnected components, denoted by N\nCQ and N\nCQ respectively. The null cone\nN CQ also consists of two irreducible components N CQ\u00b1 , which are the image of\n^\nthe two connected components of N\nCQ respectively.\nNow assume we are in the symplectic case, or in the orthogonal case but n 6= 2m.\n^\nThen Jr (V ) is connected smooth and so is N\nCQ. Thus N CQ is irreducible as the\n^\nimage of the surjective map \u03bc0 of the irreducible variety N\nCQ.\n\n1.4\n\nRelations with closure of conjugacy classes\n\nIn this subsection,we always assume that n \u2265 2m, and in addition m is even in the\northogonal case. We need to reformulate the definition of N CQ.\nLet W be a vector space of complex dimension m with a non-degenerate bilinear\nform of type opposite to the one on V . We identify Hom(W, V ) = Mnm . Given\nany T \u2208 Hom(W, V ) the adjoint T \u2217 is defined by\n(T w, v)V = (w, T \u2217 v)W ,\n\nw \u2208 W, v \u2208 V.\n\nHere we use the subscripts to indicate to which vector space a bilinear form belong.\nRemark 5 In the setup of Subsect. 1.1 and 1.2 and W = Cm , we easily check by\ndefinition that if the bilinear form on V is anti-symmetric then T \u2217 = \u2212JT t ; if the\nbilinear form on V is symmetric, then T \u2217 = T t J.\nConsider the diagram\ne\nQ\n\nHom(W, V ) \u2212\u2192 g(W )\n\u2193R\ng(V )\ne is given by T 7\u2192 T \u2217 T and R by T 7\u2192 T T \u2217 . It is easy to check that the\nwhere Q\ne and R lie in g(W ) and g(V ) respectively.
