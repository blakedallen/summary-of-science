A similarly accelerated\nphase is undergoing now [2] and has led to conceive the\nexistence of an equally unspecified dark energy component in the matter content of the Universe [3].\nAn alternative scenario has been recently proposed in\nRefs. [4, 5], based on the idea of entropic gravity introduced in Ref. [6]. In this context, the equations governing the time-evolution of the cosmic scale factor contain\nterms proportional to the Hubble function squared H 2\nand its time derivative \u1e22 originating at the boundary of\nspatial sections of our universe. According to the authors\nof Refs. [4, 5], such terms could explain the acceleration\noccurring both in the early stages and at present. Boundary terms, whose nature is well-known in General Relativity [7], have indeed been analyzed in various contexts,\nfor example in Refs. [8].\nIn this work, we will not analyze how these terms\nemerge from an action principle, nor if a unique Lagrangian can be defined at all. We shall instead assume\ngeneral modifications of the form considered in Refs. [4, 5]\nand then try to constrain their possible effectiveness by\ncomparing the corresponding Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) acoustic scale (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 11]) with\nthe most recent available WMAP data [12]. Note that\na standard Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis (usually\nemployed to extract the cosmological parameters by comparison with available observations) is not feasible if the\nmodel is unknown at the linear order. On the contrary,\nthe CMB acoustic scale can be computed directly from\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: casadio@bo.infn.it\naddress: gruppuso@iasfbo.inaf.it\n\nthe background equations, and this will allow us to obtain a constraint for the free parameters of the model by\ncomparing with the most recent CMB data.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section II we obtain the complete set of Friedman equations for a generalization of the entropic models introduced in Refs. [4, 5].\nThis, in Section III, will allow us to regard the model in\nterms of an effective dark energy contribution depending\non one parameter \u03b3. In particular, bounds on \u03b3 will be\nobtained by comparing the CMB acoustic scale with the\n7yr WMAP data in Section III B, after computing the\ndeceleration parameter in Section III A. Conclusions will\nbe drawn in Section IV.\n\nII.\n\nMODIFIED FRIEDMAN EQUATIONS\n\nIn the flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t) d~x * d~x ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the scale factor a(t) normalized so that a(tnow ) = 1,\nthe model of universe considered in Refs. [4, 5] features\na Friedman equation given by\n4 \u03c0 G\u0303 X\n\u00e4\n(\u03c1\u0303i + 3 p\u0303i ) + CH H 2 + C\u1e22 \u1e22 ,\n=\u2212\na\n3\ni\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a \u2261 a\u22121 da/dt, G\u0303 is the \"bare\" Newton\nconstant, \u03c1\u0303i and p\u0303i are the \"bare\" energy density and\npressure of the i-th fluid filling the universe, while CH\nand C\u1e22 are constants coming from the boundary terms.\nAs already stated in the Introduction, we take such terms\nas given and do not derive them from the Einstein-Hilbert\naction on a manifold with boundaries. Instead, we shall\ndetermine the full set of cosmological (and continuity)\nequations consistent with Eq. (2) without a priori fixing\nCH and C\u1e22 .\n\n\f2\nWe first note that Eq. (2) can be rewritten as\n\u1e22 + \u03b3 H 2 = \u2212\n\n4\u03c0G X\n(\u03c1\u0303i + 3 p\u0303i ) ,\n3\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03b3=\nand we rescaled\n\n1 \u2212 CH\n,\n1 \u2212 C\u1e22\n\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c1dust = \u03c1dust /a3 ,\n\n1\n\nG = G\u0303/(1 \u2212 C\u1e22 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nNoting that d/dt = (a H) d/da and assuming\n(0)\n\n\u03c1\u0303i = \u03c1\u0303i a\u2212ki ,\n\nand the corresponding constant and dimensionless coefficients crad and cdust are not observable separately, since\nonly their products appear in the equations (as we remark in Appendix A).\nEqs. (10) and (11) are precisely the standard Friedman\nequations for a universe filled with dust and radiation\nthat scale in the usual way, namely\n\np\u0303i = wi \u03c1\u0303i ,\n\n(6)\n\n(0)\n\nwith \u03c1\u0303i and wi constant, Eq. (3) can be integrated exactly and yields\n!\nX\n8\n\u03c0\nG\nC\nH2 =\nci \u03c1\u0303i + 2 \u03b3\n,\n(7)\n3\na\ni\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c1rad = \u03c1rad /a4 ,\n\n(12)\n\ncorrected by terms proportional to C. Note also that, in\nthe limit \u03b3 \u2192 1, we recover the standard cosmological\nequations (with no dark energy component!) with the\nC-term playing the role of an effective curvature contribution. However, for \u03b3 6= 1, there is a region where the\ncorrections can be interpreted as an effective dark energy\ncomponent if C > 0. This is the case we consider in the\n(0)\n(0)\nfollowing, with \u03c1dust and \u03c1rad equal to the present dust\n(0)\nand radiation densities. For example, \u03c1rad is the present\nenergy density of the black-body radiation with temperature T = 2.725 K (multiplied by the contribution from\nneutrinos).\n\nwhere the coefficients\nci =\n\n1 + 3 wi\nki \u2212 2 \u03b3\n\nare well-defined only for ki 6= 2 \u03b3 and C is a constant of\nintegration. Further, on deriving Eq. (7) with respect to\ntime and using Eqs. (3) and (8), we obtain the continuity\nequation\nH\n[(2 \u03b3 ci + 1) \u03c1\u0303i + 3 p\u0303i ] = \u03c1\u0303 \u0307 i + H ki \u03c1\u0303i = 0 ,\n\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 i +\nci\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is identically satisfied for the fluids (6). For example, for dust we have wdust = 0 and requiring kdust = 3\nyields cdust = 1/(3 \u2212 2 \u03b3). Likewise, radiation has wrad =\n1/3 and requiring krad = 4 results in crad = 1/(2 \u2212 \u03b3).\nSpecifying these parameters and assuming that the matter content of the universe is a mixture of dust and radiation, the Friedman equations (3) and (7) can be rewritten\nas (see also Appendix A)\n\" (0)\n#\n(0)\n\u03c1rad\n\u00e4\nC\n4 \u03c0 G \u03c1dust\n+ 2 4 \u2212 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b3) 2\u03b3 (10)\n= \u2212\na\n3\na3\na\na\n\"\n#\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03c1\n8 \u03c0 G \u03c1dust\nC\nH2 =\n(11)\n+ rad\n+ 2\u03b3 ,\n3\na3\na4\na\n(0)\n\u03c1dust\n\n(0)\ncdust \u03c1\u0303dust\n\n(0)\n\u03c1rad\n\n(0)\ncrad \u03c1\u0303rad\n\nwhere\n=\nand\n=\nare the\npresent matter and radiation densities involved in observations. Note that the (bare) densities \u03c1\u0303rad and \u03c1\u0303dust\n\n1\n\nIII.\n\n(8)\n\nThis rescaling [17] and Eq. (4) are meaningful only if C\u1e22 6= 1, a\ncondition we assume throughout the paper. If C\u1e22 = 1, Eq. (3)\ndoes not contain \u1e22 and is therefore not an equation of motion\nbut a constraint.\n\nEFFECTIVE DARK ENERGY\n\nThe next step is to find whether there exist values of\n\u03b3 corresponding to an accelerating universe, i.e., such\nthat \u00e4 > 0. This can be understood analyzing Eq. (10).\nThe effective dark energy term proportional to C will\nthen drive the present acceleration of the universe if it\ndominates in the r.h.s. of Eq. (10) at recent times. We\ntherefore require that \u03b3 < 3/2. Moreover, since we also\nassume C > 0, \u00e4 > 0 implies\n\u03b3<1.\n\n(13)\n\nHence, when Eq. (13) is satisfied, the C-term mimics\nthe behavior of a dark energy fluid [see Eq. (11)] with\nconstant parameter of state wX = \u22121 + 2 \u03b3/3.\nA.\n\nDeceleration parameter\n\nThe deceleration parameter is defined as\nq=\u2212\n\n\u00e4\n.\na H2\n\n(14)\n\nPlugging Eqs.

Let us recall that\nlA is not exactly the scale of the first peak. In general, the\nposition of the m-th peak is given by lm = (m \u2212 \u03c6m ) lA\nwhere \u03c6m is a phase that depends on other cosmological\nparameters [9].\nIn order to make explicit the dependence of lA on the\ncosmological parameters, we now consider separately numerator and denominator of Eq.

In Fig. 2, we show\nthe acoustic scale (long and short dashed lines) versus\n\u03b3, along with the 1-\u03c3 levels of the WMAP measurement (solid horizontal lines). We also display the dependence of the acoustic scale on zeq : the long dashed\nline stands for the 7yr WMAP best fit (zeq = 3196)\nwhereas the short dashed lines stand for its 1-\u03c3 values,\nzeq = 3196+134\n\u2212133 .\nAs Fig. 2 shows clearly, the parameter \u03b3 must be very\nclose to 0 in order to have consistency with the WMAP\nobservations. More precisely, from Eq. (21) computed at\nthe best fit values of the 7yr WMAP parameters 4 , we\nobtain\n\u03b3 = \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.04 .\n\n(23)\n\nThis result is consistent with Eq. (13) and implies\n\u22121.040 < wX < -0.986, so that the added contributions\nmust closely mimic a cosmological constant. Further,\nfrom Eq. (4), this implies that\n|1 \u2212 CH | \u226a |1 \u2212 C\u1e22 |\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present paper, we have shown how it is possible to recover standard background scalings for radiation\nand matter and standard effective cosmological equations\n[see Eqs. (10) and (11)] when the Friedman equation for\n\u00e4 is modified by adding terms proportional to H 2 and \u1e22\nlike in Eq. (2). An example that requires such a modification is given by the entropic accelerating universe of\nRefs. [4, 5], although our considerations are more general.\nMoreover we have shown how to obtain the recent cosmological acceleration within the considered model, without\nadding a dark energy fluid. We note that for the range\nof parameters considered here, the model under analysis\ndoes not modify the evolution of the universe when it\nwas matter or radiation dominated. Therefore, none of\nthe standard cosmological constraints coming from such\nearly epochs, as for instance the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), are affected.\nSpecifically, we have shown that the parameter space\nadmits a region (i.e., \u03b3 < 1) where the universe accelerates at recent cosmological times (i.e., z \u223c 0.5). In fact,\nthe additional terms mimic the behavior of a fluid with a\nconstant parameter of state wX = \u22121 + 2 \u03b3/3. This has\nbeen studied by computing the deceleration parameter q\n[see Fig. 1 and Section III A] and stringent constraints\nhave been obtained comparing the CMB acoustic scale\nlA with the WMAP 7yr release data. Note that a standard Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis (usually employed to extract the cosmological parameters by comparison with available observations) is not feasible if the\nmodel is not known at linear order 5 . On the contrary,\nthe CMB acoustic scale can be computed directly from\nthe background equations, and this has allowed us to obtain a constraint for the free parameters of the model by\ncomparing with the most recent CMB data. This comparison has told us that |\u03b3| \u226a 1 (so that wX \u2243 \u22121) and\nthe coefficients of \u1e22 and of H 2 in Eq. (2) must therefore\nsatisfy Eq. (24) for the model to be phenomenologically\nviable. In particular, the entropic accelerating universe\ncorresponds to a specific choice of the constants CH and\nC\u1e22 , that is \u03b3I = 0 and \u03b3II = 0.68 for the two cases explicitly mentioned in Ref. [4]. The latter is at odd with\nthe constraint (23), whereas the former is consistent.\nFuture CMB observations coming from the Planck\nsatellite 6 are expected to improve the error on the acoustic scale by about one order of magnitude [15]. The same\nimprovement is therefore expected for the estimate of the\n\n(24)\n\nin Eq. (2). For example, if 0 < CH , C\u1e22 < 1, then the\nstrong inequality (24) is satisfied for CH \u2248 1.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n6\n\nThis means taking into account only the long dashed line in\nFig. 2.\n\nIn fact, as far as we know, no Lagrangian is known for these\nmodels. However, as we stated in the Introduction, we are not\ndebating the theoretical ground the \"entropic-like\" proposal is\nbased on, but are rather interested in which constraints we can\nprovide for such class of models from what we have at hand,\ni.e. the background equations.\nPlanck (http://www.esa.int/Planck) is a project of the European\nSpace Agency, ESA.\n\n\f5\nparameter \u03b3, which, in principle, should allow us to distinguish these models from the pure \u039bCDM model with\n\u03b3 = 0. We finally mention that our findings are in agreement with those of Ref. [16].\n\n+2 crad \u03c1\u0303rad (\u03b3 \u2212 1) + 2 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\nAppendix A: Derivation of Friedman equations\n\nFrom \u1e22 = \u00e4/a \u2212 H 2 , we can rewrite Eq.
