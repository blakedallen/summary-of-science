For modeling findings of psychological\nexperiments like the reflection effect in decision behaviour under risk or\nuncertainty, we introduce reflection lattices. These are complete linear\nlattices endowed with an order reversing bijection like the reflection at 0\non the real interval [\u22121, 1]. Mathematically we investigate the lattice of\nnon-void intervals in a complete linear lattice, then the class of monotone\ninterval-valued functions and their inner product.\n\n1\n\nMotivation and survey\n\nMeasuring and aggregation or integration techniques have a very long tradition.\nHere numbers play an important role. But how do humans perceive numbers?\nThe numbers, say the set R of reals, support two basic structures, the algebraic\nstructure defined by + and \u00d7, and the ordinal structure given by \u2264. There\nare many situations where only order is relevant, cardinals being used merely\nby tradition and convenience. During the last years the interest in ordinal\naggregation has increased, see e.g. [4, 5, 6, 14, 19, 20].\nWe are interested in the question if aggregation or integration can be done\nin purely ordinal terms and what results can be obtained. Of course many\npartial results are already available. Since often they are formulated in terms\nof numbers, we ask what can be sustained if one ignores the algebraic structure\nor what weaker additional structure has to be imposed on the linear ordinal\nscale in order to formulate some well known important issues. It turns out that\nenough structure is given by an order reversing bijection of the scale leaving\none point fixed. Thus the scale decomposes into two symmetric parts. This\ncan be interpreted as the first step to numbers. Since, repeating the procedure\nwith each resulting part of the scale infinitely often, one ends up with the\n1\n\n\fbinary representation of the numbers in the unit interval [0, 1] \u2282 R or some\nsuperstructure.\nThere are several ordinal concepts for aggregating values with respect to a\nmeasure. The oldest and best known selects a certain quantile, say the median,\nof a sample as the aggregated value. Next Ky Fan's [8] metric on the space\nL0 (\u03bc) of \u03bc-measurable functions is essentially ordinal. More recently and independently Sugeno [23] developed his integral which employs the same idea as\nKy Fan. One aim of the present paper is to develop a common purely ordinal\nmodel for these three examples. This is done with a complete linear lattice M\nas scale, comprising the classical case M = [0, 1] \u2282 R. For the Sugeno integral\nthe scales used for functions and the measure are identical. But in general we\nallow separate scales for the functions and the measure and the two scales are\nrelated by a commensurability application, as we call it.\nThe structure of a linear lattice seems not to be sufficient to model elementary human behaviour in the presence of risk or uncertainty. There is some\nempirical psychological evidence (cf. reflection effect, inverse S-shaped decision\nweights, etc.) that in certain decision situations humans have a point O of reference (often the status quo) on their scale which allows to distinguish good\nand bad or gains and losses, i.e. values above, respectively below, the reference\npoint [17, 18]. Then the attainable gains and the attainable losses are aggregated separately and finally these two aggregated values are compared to reach\nthe final decision. In the cardinal models this behaviour can be modeled with\nthe symmetric Choquet integral. We define the symmetric Sugeno integral in\norder to model the essentials of this behaviour in purely ordinal terms.\nWe also define the analogue of the asymmetric Choquet integral in our context. This can be done in introducing two commensurability functions, one for\nthe positive part of the scale, the other one for the negative part.\nFinally we comment on the new technical tools and the organisation of the\npaper. In Section 2 we model the scale with neutral reference point as a complete linear reflection lattice R corresponding to [\u22121, 1] \u2282 R. On R we use\nthe binary relations from [14] to get operations corresponding to addition and\nmultiplication in R.\nIn Section 3 we develop a theory of increasing interval valued functions and\ntheir inverse. Introducing these tools is motivated as follows. Mathematically,\nthe idea of Fan and Sugeno for the aggregated value of a random variable is very\nsimple, just take the argument at which the decreasing distribution function\nintersects a preselected increasing function, the identity function in their case.\nAs already the quantiles show, the aggregated values are intervals rather than\npoints on the linear scale L. So we look for a suitable ordering on the family\nIL of nonempty intervals in L. The ordering which had been introduced by\nTopkis (see [24]) on the family of nonempty sublattices of an arbitrary lattice\nturns out to be the right one to handle monotonic functions (Proposition 3.1).\nThis ordering, restricted to IL , is only a partial one, but we show that IL is a\ncompletely distributive lattice in our situation. This structure is needed for an\nordinal analogue of the inner product of vectors, which is introduced in Section\n4. This product will, in Section 7, formalise the idea of Fan and Sugeno in our\n2\n\n\fgeneral context. Still in Section 4 the product provides a convenient tool to\nfill the gaps in the domain of the inverse of a monotone function, we call this\nsaturation.\nIn close analogy to probability theory we introduce lattice valued measures\nin Section 5 and, in Section 6, the distribution function and its saturated inverse,\nthe quantile function. In Section 7 we define an aggregated value of a function\nf as the product of a preselected commensurability function with the quantile\nfunction of f . To meet the empirical findings w.r.t. a neutral reference point\nmentioned above, we generalise our model in Section 8 to functions having values\nin a reflection lattice as introduced in Section 1.\nIn Section 9 we define the ordinal analogue of a metric induced by a FanSugeno functional and use this to define the ordinal Ky-Fan 'norm' k * k0 and\nthe ordinal supremum-norm k * k\u221e .\n\n2\n\nThe reflection lattice\n\nThe order structure of the real line allows for the order reversing reflection at\nthe null. This structure will be generalised in this section to be the range of the\nfunctions to be integrated. That is, we apply isomorphic scales for gains and\nfor losses.\nThroughout this section L will denote a complete distributive lattice with\nbottom O and top I. We endow the set L\u2212 := {\u2212a | a \u2208 L} with the reversed\norder from L, i.e. \u2212a \u2264 \u2212b in L\u2212 iff a \u2265 b in L. The bottom of L\u2212 is now \u2212I\nand the top \u2212O. The disjoint union R of L and L\u2212 , with \u2212O identified with\nO,\nO = \u2212O ,\nand setting a \u2264 b for a \u2208 L\u2212 , b \u2208 L+ , is called a reflection lattice and O the\nneutral or reference point. If, in addition, R is totally ordered, we call it a\nlinear reflection lattice. R is again a (totally ordered) complete distributive\nlattice and it has bottom \u2212I and top I. For emphasising the symmetry we often\nwrite L+ for L \u2282 R, hence L+ = {a \u2208 R | a \u2265 O}, L\u2212 = {a \u2208 R | a \u2264 O}. On\nthe reflection lattice R we have the reflection at O\nrefl : R \u2192 R ,\n\nx 7\u2192 \u2212x ,\n\nwhere \u2212(\u2212a) := a for a \u2208 R. The reflection reverses the ordering of R,\na < b iff \u2212 a > \u2212b ,\n(\u2212a) \u2228 (\u2212b) = \u2212(a \u2227 b) ,\n\n(\u2212a) \u2227 (\u2212b) = \u2212(a \u2228 b) .\n\nWe also define the absolute value\nabs : R \u2192 L+ ,\n\nx 7\u2192 |x| :=\n\n3\n\n\u001a\n\nx\n\u2212x\n\nif x \u2265 O\nif x < O\n\n\fand the sign function\nsign : R \u2192 R ,\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 I\nO\nsign x =\n\uf8f3\n\u2212I\n\nfor x > O\nfor x = O .\nfor x < O\n\nExample 2.1 The standard example for a linear reflection lattice is R\u222a{\u2212\u221e, \u221e}\nwith the usual ordering \u2264 and inf, sup as lattice operations \u2227, \u2228. Here \u2212I =\n\u2212\u221e, I = \u221e and O = 0. Any closed, reflection invariant subset R of this\nreflection lattice containing 0 is again a reflection lattice with I = supx\u2208L x . \u2737\nTwo new operations \u25bd and \u25b3 are defined on a reflection lattice R which\nwill play the roles of addition and multiplication for numbers (introduced in [11]\nfor linear reflection lattices). On L+ they coincide with the lattice operations\n\u2228, \u2227.\n\uf8f1\nx \u2228 y if x, y \u2208 L+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 x \u2227 y if x, y \u2208 L\u2212\nx\nif sign x 6= sign y, |x| > |y|\nx \u25bd y :=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ny\nif sign x 6= sign y, |x| < |y|\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nO\nif sign x 6= sign y, |x| = |y| or |x|, |y| are incomparable.\n1\n\nExcept for the last case, x \u25bd y equals the absolutely larger one of the two\nelements x and y.\n\u001a\n|x| \u2227 |y|\nif sign x = sign y\nx \u25b3 y :=\n\u2212(|x| \u2227 |y|)\n\nelse.\n\nThe absolute value of x \u25b3 y equals |x| \u2227 |y| and x \u25b3 y < O iff the two elements\nx and y have opposite signs.\nProposition 2.1 For a,b,c in a reflection lattice R = L+ \u222a L\u2212 we have\n(i) \u25bd and \u25b3 are commutative operations;\n(ii) O is the unique neutral element of \u25bd in R and I the unique neutral\nelement of \u25b3.\n(iii) \u2212(a \u25bd b) = (\u2212a) \u25bd (\u2212b) and \u2212(a \u25b3 b) = (\u2212a) \u25b3 b;\n(iv) \u25bd is associative on L+ and on L\u2212 , \u25b3 is associative on R;\n(v) if a, b, c \u2208 L+ or a, b, c \u2208 L\u2212 then a \u25b3 (b \u25bd c) = (a \u25b3 b) \u25bd (a \u25b3 c) .\n(vi) a \u2264 b implies a \u25bd c \u2264 b \u25bd c and a \u25b3 c \u2264 b \u25b3 c.\n1 Quoting Rubos [22]: . . . the preorder on preferences is partial, and individuals stay with\nthe status quo when unable to make a comparison, we see that the definition of \u25bd for incomparable |x|, |y| matches with experimental evidence as summarised by Rubos.\n\n4\n\n\fThe straightforward proofs are omitted. Only the proof of (vi) is cumbersome because of the many cases to be checked. \u25bd is not associative since\nI \u25bd (I \u25bd (\u2212I)) = I 6= O = (I \u25bd I) \u25bd (\u2212I). This happens already in the smallest\nnon-trivial reflection lattice which is a special case of Example 2.1.\nExample 2.2 In R = {\u22121, 0, 1} \u2282 R the operation \u25b3 coincides with multiplication in R (which is associative) and the operation \u25bd is similar to addition\nwith the exception that sums greater than 1 are pulled down to 1 and sums\nbelow \u22121 are replaced by \u22121.\n\u2737\nNon-associativity of \u25bd will not bother us in the present paper, since we have\nonly to combine two elements with \u25bd . For a detailed study of associativity in\na linear reflection lattice see [11].\n\u25bd playing the role of addition, we call a \u25bd (\u2212b) the (pseudo) difference\nof a and b in R. Then we define the distance of a and b in R by\n\u001a\nO\nif x = y\ndist(x, y) := |x \u25bd (\u2212y)| =\n.\n|x| \u2228 |y| else\nThis distance has the usual properties if + is replaced by \u2228\ndist(x, y)\ndist(x, y)\n\n\u2265 O and dist(x, y) = O iff x = y ,\n= dist(y, x) ,\n\ndist(x, z) \u2264 dist(x, y) \u2228 dist(y, z) .\nAlso dist(x, O) = |x|.\n\n3\n\nMonotone interval-valued functions\n\nA weakly monotone function is not invertible, but pseudo-inverses are often\nused in probability theory. Likewise they are important in our purely ordinal\napproach. As the pseudo inverse of a monotone function can be perceived as an\ninterval-valued function, we use the terminology of set-valued mappings, also\ncalled correspondences. We give two equivalent definitions of isotonicity. For\none of them an ordering for intervals is introduced.\nLet M and L be arbitrary sets. A correspondence \u03c6 from M to L is a\nmapping M \u2192 2L which assigns to x \u2208 M a subset \u03c6(x) \u2282 L. An ordinary\nfunction is a correspondence with \u03c6(x) being a singleton for all x \u2208 M . Since\n\u03c6(x) may be empty for a correspondence \u03c6, the domain of \u03c6 is defined as\ndom (\u03c6) := {x \u2208 M | \u03c6(x) 6= \u2205} .\nThere is a bijection between correspondences \u03c6 from M to L and subsets of\nM \u00d7 L assigning to \u03c6 its graph,\ngraph (\u03c6) := {(x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 L | y \u2208 \u03c6(x)} .\n\n5\n\n\fThe inverse correspondence \u03c6\u22121 : L \u2192 2M of a correspondence \u03c6 : M \u2192 2L\nis defined by\n\u03c6\u22121 (y) := {x \u2208 M | (x, y) \u2208 graph (\u03c6)},\n\ny \u2208 L,\n\ni.e. \u03c6 and \u03c6\u22121 have the same graph (modulo the natural bijection M \u00d7 L \u2192\nL \u00d7 M ). \u03c6 is called surjective if its image im (\u03c6) := dom (\u03c6\u22121 ) equals total\nL.\nFor defining order preserving correspondences we suppose that M and L are\n(partially) ordered sets. A subset I of L will be called a (preference) interval2\niff for any two points a, b \u2208 I the closed interval\n[a, b] := {x \u2208 L | a \u2264 x \u2264 b}\nalso belongs to I. Notice that [a, b] = \u2205 if a > b. The intersection of intervals\nis again an interval and, if L is a linearly ordered lattice, also the union of two\nintersecting intervals is an interval. We denote with IL the set of all nonempty\npreference intervals in L.\nA correspondence \u03c6 from M to L is called isotonic or increasing if for\nall (x1 , y2 ), (x2 , y1 ) \u2208 graph (\u03c6) with x1 \u2264 x2 , y1 \u2264 y2 the whole rectangle\n[x1 , x2 ] \u00d7 [y1 , y2 ] is contained in graph (\u03c6). If all such rectangles in graph (\u03c6)\nare degenerate, i.e. x1 = x2 or y1 = y2 , then \u03c6 is called sharply increasing.\nClearly an increasing correspondence \u03c6 from M to L is interval valued, so it\ncan be perceived as an application\n\u03c6 : D \u2192 IL\n\nwith D := dom (\u03c6) \u2282 M .\n\nOur definition is symmetric in both coordinates of M \u00d7 L, so the inverse correspondence \u03c6\u22121 of an increasing correspondence \u03c6 is increasing, too. Especially\n\u03c6\u22121 is interval valued,\n\u03c6\u22121 : E \u2192 IM\n\nwith E := dom (\u03c6\u22121 ) = im (\u03c6) \u2282 L .\n\n(1)\n\nIf the ordered set L is a lattice our definition can be formulated more naturally in introducing an ordering on IL . Topkis (see [24]) deduces from the\nordering of L the relation \u2291 on 2L \\ {\u2205} in defining\nY1 \u2291 Y2\n\niff y1 \u2227 y2 \u2208 Y1 and y1 \u2228 y2 \u2208 Y2 for all y1 \u2208 Y1 , y2 \u2208 Y2 .\n\nHe shows ([24] Lemma 2.4.1) that the relation \u2291 is transitive and antisymmetric.\nFurthermore it is reflexive, hence an ordering, if it is restricted to the set of\nnonempty sublattices of L ([24] Theorem 2.4.1). We excluded the empty set\nfrom IL in order to get an order relation on this set, provided L is linearly\nordered (recall that an open interval in a non-linear lattice is no sublattice in\ngeneral). IL does not inherit from L the linearity of the ordering. If L has\nat least three elements y1 < y2 < y3 then the intervals [y2 , y2 ] and [y1 , y3 ] are\nincomparable w.r.t. \u2291 in IL .\n2 This notion is due to [9], the usual definition of (closed, open or semiclosed) intervals,\nwhich is common in order theory, is not sufficient in our context.\n\n6\n\n\fProposition 3.1 Let M be an ordered set and L a linearly ordered lattice.\n\u03c6 : M \u2192 IL is increasing iff x1 \u2264 x2 implies \u03c6(x1 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ).\nProof Let us call the last condition \u2291-increasing. First suppose \u03c6 is increasing.\nLet x1 \u2264 x2 and y1 \u2208 \u03c6(x1 ), y2 \u2208 \u03c6(x2 ). We have to show y1 \u2227 y2 \u2208 \u03c6(x1 ) and\ny1 \u2228 y2 \u2208 \u03c6(x2 ). This is obvious if y1 \u2264 y2 , hence we may suppose y1 > y2 since\nL is totally ordered. Since (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ) \u2208 graph (\u03c6) and \u03c6 is increasing we\nget [x1 , x2 ] \u00d7 [y2 , y1 ] \u2282 graph (\u03c6), especially y1 \u2227 y2 = y2 \u2208 \u03c6(x1 ), y1 \u2228 y2 = y1 \u2208\n\u03c6(x2 ).\nNow suppose that \u03c6 is \u2291-increasing. Consider (x1 , y2 ), (x2 , y1 ) \u2208 graph (\u03c6)\nwith x1 \u2264 x2 , y1 \u2264 y2 and take (x, y) in the rectangle [x1 , x2 ] \u00d7 [y1 , y2 ]. We\nhave to show (x, y) \u2208 graph (\u03c6). We know \u03c6(x1 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ) since \u03c6 is\n\u2291-increasing. This entails y1 = y2 \u2227 y1 \u2208 \u03c6(x1 ) and similarly y2 \u2208 \u03c6(x2 ). Hence\ny \u2208 \u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 ) and, with an element y3 \u2208 \u03c6(x), y \u2228 y3 , y3 \u2227 y \u2208 \u03c6(x), so\ny \u2208 \u03c6(x).\n\u2737\nA function, perceived as a correspondence, is increasing iff it is an increasing\nfunction in the usual sense (for singletons \u2291 coincides with the ordering \u2264 on L).\nThe results on increasing correspondences dualise in the obvious manner. So we\ncan use freely decreasing (or antitonic) correspondences with their respective\nproperties. As usual monotone means increasing or decreasing.\nWe investigate the lattice structure of the family IL .\nProposition 3.2 Let (L, \u2264) be a linearly ordered lattice. Then\n(i) (IL , \u2291) is a lattice, containing (L, \u2264) as the sublattice of singletons;\n(ii) {O} is the bottom and {I} the top of (IL , \u2291) if O is the bottom and I the\ntop of (L, \u2264);\n(iii) if (L, \u2264) is complete, so is (IL , \u2291);\n(iv) (IL , \u2291) is distributive. It is completely distributive if (L, \u2264) is complete.\nUnder the assumptions of Proposition 3.2 the lattice operations join and meet\nin (IL , \u2291) will be denoted by \u2294 and \u2293. The proof of (i) shows\nI1 \u2294 I2 = {a1 \u2228 a2 | ai \u2208 Ii , i = 1, 2} ,\n\n(2)\n\nI1 \u2293 I2 = {a1 \u2227 a2 | ai \u2208 Ii , i = 1, 2} ,\nand similarly for any number of \u2294 or \u2293 (see (3)). For closed (and similarly for\nopen) intervals these formulas look more familiar,\n[a1 , b1 ] \u2294 [a2 , b2 ] = [a1 \u2228 a2 , b1 \u2228 b2 ] ,\n\n[a1 , b1 ] \u2293 [a2 , b2 ] = [a1 \u2227 a2 , b1 \u2227 b2 ].\n\nRecall for (iv) that a linearly ordered complete lattice is completely distributive\n([1] V.5). Proposition 3.2 can be generalised to arbitrary (distributive) lattices\nL if IL is replaced by the set of closed nonempty intervals (cf. [21] 2.2).\n\n7\n\n\fProof (i) Given I1 , I2 \u2208 IL , we have to show that a least upper bound (and\nsimilarly a greatest lower bound) of I1 and I2 does exist in IL . Our candidate\nis\nJ := {a1 \u2228 a2 | ai \u2208 Ii , i = 1, 2} .\nFirst J is nonempty since the Ii are nonempty. Also J is a (preference) interval.\nTo see this we show that the closed interval defined by any two points of J, say\na1 \u2228 a2 < b1 \u2228 b2 , is contained in J. Let a1 \u2228 a2 < c < b1 \u2228 b2 , then for some i,\nc < bi and, for this i, also ai < c. Hence c \u2208 Ii . Let j be the complementary\nindex to i, i.e. {j} = {1, 2} \\ {i}, then we get c = c \u2228 aj \u2208 J as desired.\nWe just verified that J \u2208 IL and have to show now that J is the least upper\nbound of I1 and I2 , i.e. K \u2292 I1 , I2 , K \u2208 IL imply K \u2292 J. For a1 \u2228 a2 \u2208 J\nwith ai \u2208 Ii and c \u2208 K we know (a1 \u2228 a2 ) \u2227 c = (a1 \u2227 c) \u2228 (a2 \u2227 c) \u2208 J and\n(a1 \u2228 a2 ) \u2228 c = (a1 \u2228 c) \u2228 (a2 \u2228 c) \u2208 K. These are the conditions for K \u2292 J.\nFinally a 7\u2192 {a} = [a, a] defines an isomorphism of (L, \u2264) to the sublattice\nof singletons in IL .\n(ii) is obvious.\n(iii)W Let {Ii | i \u2208 N } be an arbitrary subset of IL . Since L is complete we\nknow i\u2208N ai \u2208 L for ai \u2208 Ii , i \u2208 N . Now one verifies like for (i) that\n_\n{\nai | ai \u2208 Ii , i \u2208 N }\n(3)\ni\u2208N\n\nis the least upper bound of the Ii , i \u2208 N , in IL . Compared to (i) we now need\ncomplete distributivity of L, but this property holds for a complete linear lattice\nas we remarked above. The proof for the greatestFlower bound runs dually.\n(iv) Denoting the least upper bound (3) with i\u2208N Ii and also applying the\ndual notation, we have to show\nG\nG\nIi,k ) =\n(\n(\nI\u03ba(k),k )\nk\u2208K\n\n\u03ba\u2208K\n\ni\u2208Nk\n\nk\u2208K\n\n(and the dual equation) for Ii \u2208 IL first with a finite family K of finite index\nsets Nk , k \u2208 K, then with an arbitrary\nS family of arbitrary index sets. Here K\ndenotes the set of functions \u03ba : K \u2192 k\u2208K Nk (the union being disjoint) with\n\u03ba(k) \u2208 Nk . Using (2) and (3), this follows from (complete) distributivity of L,\n^ _\n_ ^\n(\nai,k ) =\n(\na\u03ba(k),k ) for ai,k \u2208 Ii,k .\nk\u2208K i\u2208Nk\n\n\u03ba\u2208K k\u2208K\n\n\u2737\nFinally in this section we extend the ordering and lattice operations on IL\nto IL -valued applications. For \u03c6, \u03c8 : M \u2192 IL we define \u03c6 \u2291 \u03c8 iff \u03c6(x) \u2291 \u03c8(x)\nfor all x \u2208 M . Similarly \u03c6 \u2294 \u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2293 \u03c8 are defined pointwise.\nProposition 3.3 Let \u03c6, \u03c8 : M \u2192 IL be decreasing surjective correspondences\nfrom a complete linear lattice M to a complete linear lattice L. Then we have\n\u03c6\u22121 , \u03c8 \u22121 : L \u2192 IM , these correspondences are decreasing and\n\u03c6 \u2291 \u03c8 iff \u03c6\u22121 \u2291 \u03c8 \u22121 .\n8\n\n\fProof Since \u03c6, \u03c8 are surjective we know from (1) that \u03c6\u22121 , \u03c8 \u22121 : L \u2192 IM are\ndecreasing. Now it is sufficient to prove the 'only if' part. Contrary to \u03c6\u22121 \u2291\n\u03c8 \u22121 we assume that there is a point y \u2208 L so that \u03c6\u22121 (y) 6\u2291 \u03c8 \u22121 (y). Then either\nthe intervals \u03c6\u22121 (y), \u03c8 \u22121 (y) are incomparable in (IM , \u2291) or \u03c6\u22121 (y) \u2290 \u03c8 \u22121 (y).\nIn both cases there exists a point x \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (y) with {x} \u2290 \u03c8 \u22121 (y) or a point\nx \u2208 \u03c8 \u22121 (y) with {x} \u228f \u03c6\u22121 (y). Both cases can be treated symmetrically,\nso we take the first one. Since \u03c8 \u22121 is decreasing and {x} \u2290 \u03c8 \u22121 (y) 6= \u2205 we\nknow that graph (\u03c8) cannot intersect the rectangle [x, I] \u00d7 [y, I]. Now, since\n(x, y) \u2208 graph (\u03c6), it is impossible that \u03c6(x) \u2291 \u03c8(x). But this contradicts\n\u03c6 \u2291 \u03c8.\n\u2737\n\n4\n\nInner product of interval-valued functions\n\nFor interval-valued functions we will construct an ordinal analogue to the inner\nproduct of vectors. We investigate its properties mainly for monotone correspondences, since this will serve us to define the aggregation functionals in Section\n7. The product will here be applied to saturate monotone correspondences, i.e.\nto fill the gaps in their domain.\nLet L be a complete lattice and M a set. For \u03c6, \u03c8 : M \u2192 L we define the\n(inner) product as\n_\n\u03c6 \u2217M \u03c8 :=\n\u03c6(x) \u2227 \u03c8(x) \u2208 L .\n(4)\nx\u2208M\n\nWe write \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 if there is no ambiguity about the common domain M of \u03c6\nand \u03c8. The name 'inner product' originates from the following observation. If\nL = R and M is finite, then the functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 become vectors\nin R|M| and\nW\nthe\nP product (4) resembles the inner product of vectors with corresponding to\nand \u2227 to ordinary multiplication of numbers (see Section 2). With this interpretation the product behaves 'linear' in both factors as is shown by properties\n(iv) and (v) below together with (i).\nProposition 4.1 Let L be a complete lattice and M a set. For \u03c6, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c8 :\nM \u2192 L and a \u2208 L\n(i) \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c6 ;\n(ii) the 'orthogonality' condition \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 = O holds iff \u03c6 and \u03c8 have disjoint\nsupport;\n(iii) \u03c61 \u2264 \u03c62 implies \u03c61 \u2217 \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c62 \u2217 \u03c8 ;\n(iv) (\u03c61 \u2228 \u03c62 ) \u2217 \u03c8 = (\u03c61 \u2217 \u03c8) \u2228 (\u03c62 \u2217 \u03c8) if L is distributive;\n(v) (a \u2227 \u03c6) \u2217 \u03c8 = a \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8) if L is completely distributive.\nProof (i) The binary relation \u2217 is commutative since \u2293 is.\n(ii) and (iii) are obvious.\n9\n\n\fW\n(iv) W\nUsing distributivity of L we get (\u03c61 \u2228 \u03c62 ) \u2217 \u03c8 = x\u2208M (\u03c61 (x) \u2228 \u03c62 (x)) \u2227\n\u03c8(x) = x\u2208M (\u03c61 (x)\nW = (\u03c61 \u2217 \u03c8) \u2228 (\u03c62 \u2217 \u03c8) .\nW\u2227 \u03c8(x)) \u2228 (\u03c62 (x) \u2227 \u03c8(x))\n(v) (a\u2227\u03c6)\u2217\u03c8 = x\u2208M (a\u2227\u03c6(x))\u2227\u03c8(x) = x\u2208M a\u2227(\u03c6(x)\u2227\u03c8(x)) = a\u2227(\u03c6\u2217\u03c8) .\nFor the last equality we applied complete distributivity of L.\n\u2737\nNow we confine ourselves to monotone correspondences and suppose that L\nis a complete linear lattice and that M is a linearly ordered set with bottom\nO and top I. Then, by Proposition 3.2, IL has all the properties required in\nProposition 4.1 for L.\nExample 4.1 For a \u2208 M let \u01eba denote the indicator function I[a,I] of the interval [a, I] \u2282 M . Then \u01eba \u2217 \u03c8 = \u03c8(a) for any decreasing correspondence\n\u03c8 : M \u2192 IL from M to L. Thus, for monotone functions and in the analogy with the inner product of vectors, \u01eba plays the role of the unit vector for\n'coordinate' a.\n\u2737\nIn general, the domain D of a decreasing correspondence \u03c8 : M \u2192 2L from M\nto L is a proper subset of M , D ( M .

Since \u03c6(x\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c8(x\u2032 ) = y\nfind for any x\u2032 \u2208 \u03c8d\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwe may take x = x if \u03c6(x ) = \u03c8(x ).

I1 \u2291 I2 holds\niff for each a1 \u2208 I1 there exists a2 \u2208 I2 such that a1 \u2264 a2 and for each b2 \u2208 I2\nthere exists b1 \u2208 I1 such that b1 \u2264 b2 .\n11\n\n\fProof First suppose I1 \u2291 I2 . Given a1 \u2208 I1 take any a \u2208 I2 . Then a1 \u2228 a \u2208 I2\nso that a2 := a1 \u2228 a has the desired properties. The other condition derives\nsimilarly. For sufficiency we have to show y1 \u2227 y2 \u2208 I1 and y1 \u2228 y2 \u2208 I2 for\narbitrary y1 \u2208 I1 , y2 \u2208 I2 . By assumption there exists b1 \u2208 I1 such that\nb1 \u2264 y2 . Then y1 \u2227 b1 \u2264 y1 \u2227 y2 \u2264 y1 and since I1 is an interval containing\ny1 \u2227 b1 , y1 we conclude y1 \u2227 y2 \u2208 I1 . The other condition proves analogously. \u2737\nFor the sake of completeness we mention that a dual product can be defined\nas \u03c6 \u2217\u2032 \u03c8 := x\u2208M \u03c6(x) \u2294 \u03c8(x) and that the two products are related as follows.\nProposition 4.5 Let M be a totally ordered set and L a complete linear lattice.\nIf \u03c6 : M \u2192 IL is increasing and \u03c8 : M \u2192 IL decreasing, then\n\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 \u2291 \u03c6 \u2217\u2032 \u03c8 .\nProof We are done if we show\n\u03c6(x1 ) \u2293 \u03c8(x1 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ) \u2294 \u03c8(x2 )\n\nfor all x1 , x2 \u2208 M.\n\n(5)\n\nFirst suppose x1 \u2264 x2 . Using that \u03c6 is increasing we get \u03c6(x1 ) \u2293 \u03c8(x1 ) \u2291\n\u03c6(x1 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ) \u2294 \u03c8(x2 ) . Similarly for x1 \u2265 x2 we get \u03c6(x1 ) \u2293 \u03c8(x1 ) \u2291\n\u03c8(x1 ) \u2291 \u03c8(x2 ) \u2291 \u03c6(x2 ) \u2294 \u03c8(x2 ) . Since M is totally ordered, the inequality (5)\nis proved for all x1 , x2 \u2208 M .\n\u2737\n\n5\n\nLattice-valued measures\n\nProbability measures are monotone and assume only nonnegative values. We\nmaintain this view in our ordinal context. In the cardinal theory of monotone\nmeasures there is a hierarchy of important subclasses: supermodular measures,\ntotally monotone measures (belief functions), lower chain measures, necessity\nmeasures, (\u03c3-)additive measures and the hierarchy of the respective dualisations.\nIn the purely ordinal context among these only the chain measures and necessity\n(resp. possibility) measures survive. A continuity property will also be defined\nin our ordinal environment.\nLet M denote a complete linear lattice with bottom O and top I. M will\nbe the scale of the measure to be defined. Throughout the paper, \u03a9 denotes a\nnonempty set and S \u2282 2\u03a9 a family of subsets containing \u03a9 and the empty set,\n\u2205, \u03a9 \u2208 S. A M -valued set function,\n\u03bc:S\u2192M\nis called a measure, if \u03bc(\u2205) = O, \u03bc(\u03a9) = I and it is increasing, i.e.\nA\u2282B\n\nimplies\n\n\u03bc(A) \u2264 \u03bc(B) .\n\nExample 5.1 The cardinal case M := [0, 1] \u2282 R has already been studied\nextensively in many different contexts. So \u03bc has many names in this case,\n(Choquet) capacity, non-additive or monotone measure, fuzzy measure, just to\nmention the most important ones.\n\u2737\n12\n\n\fThe inner extension of a measure \u03bc is\n_\n\u03bc(B) = \u03bc \u2217S \u03b6( * , A) ,\n\u03bc\u2217 (A) :=\n\nA \u2208 2\u03a9 .\n\nB\u2208S\nB\u2282A\n\nHere \u03b6 denotes the zeta-function of the ordered set (2\u03a9 , \u2282),\n\u001a\nI\nif A \u2283 B\n\u03b6(B, A) :=\n, A \u2208 2\u03a9 .\nO else\n3\n\nThe outer extension is defined dually, \u03bc\u2217 := \u03bc\u2217\u2032S \u03b6(A, * ) . Since \u03bc is increasing,\nso are \u03bc\u2217 and \u03bc\u2217 . For any increasing extension \u03bd of \u03bc to 2\u03a9\n\u03bc\u2217 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 \u03bc\u2217 .\n\n(6)\n\nA measure \u03bc : S \u2192 M is called a lower chain measure, if there is a chain\nw.r.t. set inclusion K \u2282 S with \u2205, \u03a9 \u2208 K such that\n\u03bc = (\u03bc|K)\u2217 |S .\nWe refer to K as a (defining) chain for \u03bc. For a lower chain measure \u03bc on S,\n\\\n^\n\u03bc(\nA) =\n\u03bc(A)\n(7)\nA\u2208A\n\nA\u2208A\n\nT\nfor all finite set systems A \u2282 S such that A\u2208A A \u2208 S. The straightforward\nproof can be found in [2] or use Proposition 4.1 (iii) together with the fact that\n\u03b6 has property (7) for the second variable.\nIf property (7) holds for arbitrary A \u2282 S and S is closed under arbitrary\nintersection, then \u03bc is called minitive or a necessity measure. Dually, one\ndefines upper chain measures and maxitive or possibility measures.\nExample 5.2 Like in the cardinal theory we call uK := \u03b6(K, * ) the unanimity\ngame for 'coalition' K \u2282 \u03a9. It is a lower chain measure with defining chain\nK := {\u2205, K, \u03a9} and it is minitive. But it is not maxitive, in general. Since\nuK (K c ) = O we get\n\u001a\nI\nif A \u2229 K 6= \u2205\nc\n\u2217\nuK (A) := (uK |{\u2205, K , \u03a9}) (A) =\n, A \u2208 2\u03a9 .\nO if A \u2282 K c\nand this is an upper chain measure. The unanimity game u{\u03c9} for the singleton\nK = {\u03c9}, often called Dirac measure at point \u03c9, simultaneously is a lower and\nupper chain measure.\n\u2737\nProposition 5.1 Any minitive measure is a lower chain measure. Also, any\nmaxitive measure is an upper chain measure.\n3 In analogy with the cardianl theory one could regard \u03bc, extended with value O from S to\n2\u03a9 , as an ordinal M\u00f6bius transform of \u03bc\u2217 . It is not unique since also \u03bc\u2217 is a M\u00f6bius transform\nof \u03bc\u2217 = (\u03bc\u2217 )\u2217 . For details see [11].\n\n13\n\n\fT\nProof Let K be the chain consisting of the sets Kx := {B | B \u2208 S, \u03bc(B) \u2265\nx}, x \u2208 M and \u2205, \u03a9. We have to prove (\u03bc|K)\u2217 |S \u2265 \u03bc since the reversed\ninequality holds by (6). Let A \u2208 S be arbitrary. With x = \u03bc(A) we get\nK\u03bc(A) \u2282 A and by minitivity\n(\u03bc|K)\u2217 (A)\n\n=\n\n_\n\n\u03bc(K)\n\nK\u2208S\nK\u2282A\n\n\u2265 \u03bc(K\u03bc(A) ) =\n\n^\n\n\u03bc(B)\n\nB\u2208S\n\u03bc(B)\u2265\u03bc(A)\n\n= \u03bc(A) .\nThe proof for the maxitive measures runs similarly.\n\n\u2737\n\nThe converse of Proposition 5.1 does not hold since, in contrast to a chain measure, a minitive (maxitive) measure has some continuity property: A minitive\n(maxitive) measure is continuous w.r.t. the lower (upper) topology of the complete lattices 2\u03a9 and M (see [15] III 1.2). But, of course, the class of minitive\n(maxitive) measures coincides with the class of lower (upper) chain measures if\n\u03a9 is finite.\n\n6\n\nThe quantile correspondence of a lattice-valued\nfunction\n\nHere we do the first steps for aggregating lattice valued functions f on \u03a9 w.r.t.\na monotone lattice-valued measure in introducing the distribution function of f\nand the saturation of its inverse, the quantile correspondence. All this is done\nin close analogy to probability theory.\nLet \u03bc : 2\u03a9 \u2192 M be a measure, M and L linear lattices and f : \u03a9 \u2192 L a\nfunction. Like in probability theory the upper level sets {f \u2265 x} := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 |\nf (\u03c9) \u2265 x} and {f > x} := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 | f (\u03c9) > x} of f for level x \u2208 L will play an\nimportant role. Clearly the family of all upper level sets of f forms a chain. We\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\ndenote\nS it with Kf \u2282 2 . A family F \u2282 L of functions is called comonotonic\nif f \u2208F Kf forms again a chain. For other characterisations of comonotonicity\nsee [3].\nThe distribution function G\u03bc,f : L \u2192 M of f is defined as\nG\u03bc,f (x) := \u03bc(f \u2265 x) ,\n\nx \u2208 L.\n\nObviously, G\u03bc,f is a decreasing function. Since, in general, G\u03bc,f is not surjective,\nthe domain of G\u22121\n\u03bc,f can be a proper subset of M . We extend it by means of the\n\u22121\n[\nsharp saturation G\ndefined in Section 4.4 In analogy with probability theory,\n\u03bc,f\n\n4 In many practical applications the scale L is finite. Then one can avoid the saturation\nin replacing G\u03bc,f by the following sharply decreasing interval-valued correspondence, which\n\n14\n\n\fwe define for p \u2208 M the p-quantile of f w.r.t. \u03bc as the interval\n\u22121\n[\nQ\u03bc,f (p) := G\n\u03bc,f (p) \u2208 IL .\n\nThe quantile correspondence Q\u03bc,f is sharply decreasing in the variable p \u2208\nM (Proposition 4.3 (i)). If M has the additional structure of a reflection lattice\nwith fixed point p0 then Q\u03bc,f (p0 ) is called the median of f w.r.t. \u03bc (cf. Example\n7.3 below).\nProposition 6.1 Let \u03bc : 2\u03a9 \u2192 M be a measure, M and L complete linear\nlattices and f , g \u2208 L\u03a9 functions. Then\nG\u03bc,f \u2228g \u2265 G\u03bc,f \u2228 G\u03bc,g ,\n\nG\u03bc,f \u2227g \u2264 G\u03bc,f \u2227 G\u03bc,g\n\nQ\u03bc,f \u2228g \u2292 Q\u03bc,f \u2294 Q\u03bc,g ,\n\nQ\u03bc,f \u2227g \u2291 Q\u03bc,f \u2293 Q\u03bc,g\n\nand equality holds if f , g are comonotonic. If \u03bc is an upper (lower) chain\nmeasure then equality holds, too, in the formula for f \u2228 g (f \u2227 g, respectively).\nProof We first get G\u03bc,f \u2228g (x) \u2265 G\u03bc,f (x) \u2228 G\u03bc,g (x) applying the monotone\nmeasure \u03bc on the sets\n{f \u2228 g \u2265 x} = {f \u2265 x or g \u2265 x} = {f \u2265 x} \u222a {g \u2265 x} \u2283 {f \u2265 x} , {g \u2265 x} .\nIf f , g are comonotonic we have {f \u2265 x} \u2283 {g \u2265 x} or the converse so that we\nget an equality. With an upper chain measure we can apply the dual of (7), so\nthat we get equality, too. The assertion with \u2227 proves similarly.\nThe result for the distribution correspondences translates to the corresponding result for the quantile correspondences by means of Proposition 4.3 (ii):\n\u22121\n\u22121\n[\nG\n\u2265G\nimplies Q\n= G\\\n\u2292G\n=Q\nand similarly with g in\n\u03bc,f \u2228g\n\n\u03bc,f\n\n\u03bc,f \u2228g\n\n\u03bc,f \u2228g\n\n\u03bc,f\n\n\u03bc,f\n\nplace of f on the right hand sides. Both relations together imply the result. \u2737\nThe partial order on the set of distribution functions or on the set of quantile correspondences induces a partial order on L\u03a9 , often called stochastic dominance. In the next section we investigate extensions of this order to total orders.\n\n7\n\nFan-Sugeno functionals\n\nThis is the main part of the article. The former results are applied to define\nthe class of Fan-Sugeno functionals for lattice valued functions w.r.t. a lattice\nvalued monotone measure and to derive the essential properties.\nHere L and M are complete linear lattices. Let \u03bc : 2\u03a9 \u2192 M be an M -valued\nmeasure on a set \u03a9 and l : M \u2192 L an increasing function. l relates the scale\nof the measure \u03bc to the scale of the functions f \u2208 L\u03a9 , hence we call it the\nis already surjective: x 7\u2192]\u03bc(f > x), \u03bc(f \u2265 x)] for x \u2208 L \\ {I} (here read ]a, a] = {a}) and\nI 7\u2192 [O, \u03bc(f \u2265 I)]. Similarly, in the classical context with L = R, M = [0, 1] \u2282 R and\n\u03bc continuous from above and below, one has to close the intervals above in order that the\ndistribution correspondence becomes surjective.\n\n15\n\n\fcommensurability function. The interval-valued Fan-Sugeno functional\nS\u03bc,l : L\u03a9 \u2192 IL is defined by means of the inner product \u2217 of Section 4 as\nS\u03bc,l (f ) := l \u2217 Q\u03bc,f .\nAlways S\u03bc,l (f ) is a nonempty interval. Often a single value is preferred, then\nthe least upper bound is the right one. We define\n_\nx.\nS \u03bc,l (f ) :=\nx\u2208S\u03bc,l (f )\n\nIf L = M and l is the identity mapping idM on M , i.e. l(p) = p, p \u2208 M , then we\nwrite S\u03bc or S \u03bc for short. The name, we attribute to these functionals, deduces\nfrom the following special cases.\nExample 7.1 Let M = [0, 1] \u2282 R, L = [0, \u221e], l(x) = x for x \u2208 M and \u03bc\na probability measure on a \u03c3-algebra. Since we have defined the Fan-Sugeno\nfunctional only for ordinal measures on the total power set 2\u03a9 we first extend\n\u03bc, say to the inner extension \u03bc\u2217 . Now, for two real random variables f , g on\n\u03a9, the number S \u03bc\u2217 ,l (|f \u2212 g|) is the distance kf \u2212 gk0 of f and g in the Ky Fan\nmetric of the space L0 (\u03bc) of measurable functions ([8], see also theorems 9.2.2\nand 9.2.3 in [7]). Convergence in probability is convergence in this metric. \u2737\nExample 7.2 Let L = M = [0, 1], \u03bc a fuzzy measure on 2\u03a9 (Example 5.1) and\nf : \u03a9 \u2192 [0, 1]. Then\n_\nG\nx \u2227 G\u03bc,f (x) .\n{x} \u2293 Q\u03bc,f (x) , S \u03bc (f ) =\nS\u03bc (f ) =\nx\u2208[0,1]\n\nx\u2208[0,1]\n\nThe functional S \u03bc (f ) is the Sugeno integral of f w.r.t. \u03bc ([23]).\n\n\u2737\n\nAnother special case of our general functional is even better and longer known\nthan the examples above.\nExample 7.3 Let p \u2208 M and l := \u01ebp (see Example 4.1), then S\u03bc,\u01ebp (f ) =\n\u01ebp \u2217 Q\u03bc,f = Q\u03bc,f (p), the p-quantile of f . The classical case is M = [0, 1] \u2282 R,\nL = R, where S\u03bc,\u01ebp (f ) is the (1 \u2212 p)-quantile of f in the usual terminology.\nThe difference to our present terminology results from the fact that we are\nemploying the decreasing distribution function whereas classically one employs\nthe increasing one. Of special importance is the case p = 12 , then S\u03bc,\u01ebp (f )\nis the median of f , which, in applications of probability theory, is the second\nimportant location parameter after the expected value.\n\u2737\nProposition 7.1 Let L, M be complete linear lattices. Let \u03bb, \u03bc : 2\u03a9 \u2192 M be\nM -valued measures on a set \u03a9 and k, l : M \u2192 L commensurability functions.\nThe Fan-Sugeno functional has the following properties where f, g \u2208 L\u03a9 , a \u2208 L:\n(i) l(\u03bc(A)) = S \u03bc,l (IA ) for A \u2282 \u03a9, especially \u03bc can be reconstructed from S \u03bc ;\n16\n\n\f(ii) f \u2264 g implies S\u03bc,l (f ) \u2291 S\u03bc,l (g) ;\n(iii) If l(O) = O, then S\u03bc,l (a \u2227 f ) = {a} \u2293 S\u03bc,l (f ) ;\n(iv) S\u03bc,l (f \u2228 g) \u2292 S\u03bc,l (f ) \u2294 S\u03bc,l (g)\nand equality holds if \u03bc is an upper chain measure;\n(v) Comonotonic maxitivity: if f, g are comonotonic, then\nS\u03bc,l (f \u2228 g) = S\u03bc,l (f ) \u2294 S\u03bc,l (g) ;\n(vi) \u03bb \u2264 \u03bc and k \u2264 l imply S\u03bb,k (f ) \u2291 S\u03bc,l (f ) .\nProof (i) Since Q\u03bc,IA (\u03bc(A)) =]O, I] and Q\u03bc,IA (p) = OFfor p > \u03bc(A) and I for\np < \u03bc(A) we see that l(\u03bc(A)) is the top of l \u2217 Q\u03bc,IA = p\u2208M l(p) \u2293 Q\u03bc,IA (p).\n(ii) From f \u2264 g one easily derives G\u03bc,f \u2264 G\u03bc,g . Then by Proposition 4.3 (ii)\nQ\u03bc,f \u2291 Q\u03bc,g and by Proposition 4.1 (iii) the result follows.\n(iii) We know Q\u03bc,a\u2227f = Q\u03bc,a \u2293 Q\u03bc,f from Proposition 6.1 since a and f\nare comonotonic. We have Q\u03bc,a (p) = a, except for p = O and p = I, where\nQ\u03bc,a (O) =]a, I] and Q\u03bc,a (I) = [O, a]. Now observe that l(O) \u2293 Q\u03bc,a (O) = O =\nl(O) \u2293 {a} since l(O) = O, and Q\u03bc,f (I) \u2293 Q\u03bc,a (I) = Q\u03bc,f (I) \u2293 {a} since Q\u03bc,f (I)\nis an interval with bottom O. This proves that (Q\u03bc,a \u2293 Q\u03bc,f ) \u2217 l = (a \u2293 Q\u03bc,f ) \u2217 l.\nWe obtain the desired result by applying Proposition 4.1 (v).\n(iv) We know Q\u03bc,f \u2228g \u2292 Q\u03bc,f \u2294 Q\u03bc,g (Proposition 6.1) and this relation is\nmaintained if we \u2217-multiply with l (Proposition 4.1 (iii)). Finally, the result\nfollows by distributivity of \u2217 with \u2294 (Proposition 4.1 (iv)).\n(v) The proof runs like in (iv).\n(vi) From \u03bb \u2264 \u03bc one easily derives G\u03bb,f \u2264 G\u03bc,f . Then by Proposition 4.3\n(ii) Q\u03bb,f \u2291 Q\u03bc,f and, applying Proposition 4.1 (iii) twice, the result follows. \u2737\nWe mention some further properties. The transformation rule proves like\nfor the Choquet integral (see [3]) and the Fan-Sugeno operators are compatible\nwith increasing transformations of L and M .\nFor better understanding some of these properties we again employ the analogy of \u2228 or \u2294 with the sum of real numbers and of \u2227 or \u2293 with the product.\nProperties (iii) and (iv) tell us that the Fan-Sugeno functional is a 'linear' operator for upper chain measures. So, in the ordinal context, the upper chain\nmeasures play the role of probability measures.\nThe dual of properties (iv) and (v) for f \u2227 g cannot be proved here since \u2217 is\ndistributive with \u2294, but not with \u2293. These properties for f \u2227 g can be obtained\nwith the dual functional, defined with the dual product \u2217\u2032 (see proposition 4.5).\nIn case of the Sugeno integral (Example 7.2) S \u03bc coincides with its dual (see e.g.\n[20]). We illustrate this duality by an example.\nExample 7.4 Let L = M = [0, 1], l the identity mapping and \u03bc, f so that\n\uf8f1\nfor 0 \u2264 x \u2264 .2\n\uf8f2 1\n.5 for .2 < x \u2264 .6\nG\u03bc,f (x) =\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor .6 < x \u2264 1\nThen S\u03bc (f ) =].2, .5], whereas the dual functional had the value [.5, .6].\n17\n\n\u2737\n\n\fFor {0, 1}-valued measures our functional coincides with the Choquet integral. We demonstrate this fact for unanimity games and their conjugate in the\nnext example.\nExample 7.5 Let M = {O, I}, l(O) = O, l(I) = I then S\u03bc,l (f ) = (O \u2293\nQ\u03bc,f (O)) \u2294 (I \u2293W\nQ\u03bc,f (I)) = Q\u03bc,f (I). Especially\nV 5.2) we\nW\nVfor \u03bc = uK (Example\nget S uK ,l (f ) = {x | {f \u2265 x} \u2283 K} = {x | \u03c9\u2208K f (\u03c9) \u2265 x} = \u03c9\u2208K f (\u03c9) .\nW\n\u2737\nSimilarly S uK ,l (f ) = \u03c9\u2208K f (\u03c9) .\n\n8\n\nFan-Sugeno functionals for R-valued functions\n\nNow we consider functions, for which the range is not only a linear lattice but\nhas the structure of a linear reflection lattice as introduced in Section 2. Like\nfor the Choquet integral there are two ways to extend the functional of the last\nsection to functions, taking positive and negative values. One way results in a\nfunctional that is symmetric w.r.t. the reflection at O, the other one will be an\nasymmetric functional. Both functionals can be applied at least to situations\nwhere the respective Choquet integrals can be applied.\nLet R be a linear reflection lattice with positive part L = L+ . For a function\nf : \u03a9 \u2192 R we define the positive part f + and the negative part f \u2212 by\nf + (\u03c9) := f (\u03c9) \u2228 O ,\n\nf \u2212 := (\u2212f )+\n\nand one easily sees that f is the difference of f + and f \u2212 ,\nf = f + \u25bd (\u2212f \u2212 ) .\nBy means of this representation we define the symmetric extension of the FanSugeno functional S\u03bc,l : L\u03a9 \u2192 IL+ with a commensurability function l : M \u2192\nL+ to the symmetric Fan-Sugeno functional SS\u03bc,l : R\u03a9 \u2192 R as the pseudodifference\nSS\u03bc,l (f ) := S\u03bc,l (f + ) \u25bd (\u2212S\u03bc,l (f \u2212 )) .\n\n(8)\n\nHere the pseudo-addition \u25bd operates on intervals, not points of R, which\nremains to be defined. Clearly the disjoint union R of IL\u2212 and IL+ with\n{\u2212O} \u2208 IL\u2212 identified with {O} \u2208 IL+ forms a non-linear reflection lattice so\nthat the pseudo-addition \u25bd as defined in Section 2 applies to R. On IL+ the\noperation \u25bd coincides with \u2294. A noticeable property of SS\u03bc,l (f ) is that its\nvalue is O as soon as S\u03bc,l (f + ) and S\u03bc,l (f \u2212 ) are incomparable intervals in IL+\n(see footnote 1).\nUsing (\u2212f )+ = f \u2212 , (\u2212f )\u2212 = f + and a \u25bd (\u2212b) = \u2212(b \u25bd (\u2212a)) (Proposition\n2.1 (iii)) one easily checks the symmetry property\nSS\u03bc,l (\u2212f ) = \u2212SS\u03bc,l (f ) .\nIt is easy to check that defining SS \u03bc,l by replacing in (8) S\u03bc,l by S \u03bc,l , then\nthe symmetry property still holds. Also properties (i) and (ii) of Proposition\n7.1 still hold for SS \u03bc,l and SS \u03bc,l (see Proposition 2.1 (vi)).\n18\n\n\fHuman behaviour with respect to gains and losses seem not to be symmetric (see e.g. [18]). So it might be useful to apply different commensurability\nfunctions for the positive and negative parts. Let k, l : M \u2192 L+ be increasing\nfunctions. One may generalise (8) to SS\u03bc,k,l (f ) := S\u03bc,l (f + ) \u25bd (\u2212S\u03bc,k (f \u2212 )) .\nNow we need another pair of increasing commensurability functions, l+ :\nM \u2192 L+ and l\u2212 : M \u2192 L\u2212 for defining the asymmetric Fan-Sugeno functional AS\u03bc,l\u2212 ,l+ : R\u03a9 \u2192 R,\nAS\u03bc,l\u2212 ,l+ (f ) := S\u03bc,l\u2212 (f ) \u25bd S\u03bc,l+ (f ) .\nLike before we have to check if the operation on the right hand side is well\ndefined. This is the case since l\u2212 has values in L\u2212 so that S\u03bc,l\u2212 (f ) \u2208 IL\u2212 and\nsimilar for the other term. Comparing with (8), here we have the same function\nin the two expressions on the right hand side but different commensurability\nfunctions. Also \u2212l\u2212 and l+ cannot be compared without an additional structure\nof their common domain L+ (to be a reflection lattice, for example) since \u2212l\u2212\nis decreasing and l+ increasing.\nThe asymmetric Fan-Sugeno functional is asymmetric in the following sense:\n\u2217\n(f ).\nAS\u03bc,l\u2212 ,l+ (\u2212f ) = \u2212AS\u03bc,\u2212l\n+ ,\u2212l\u2212\n\nHere the upper \u2217 denotes the conjugate5 Fan-Sugeno functional, which is\nperformed with the increasing distribution function and the decreasing commensurability correspondences \u2212l+ , \u2212l\u2212 . We leave the details for further research.\nFor the moment we can say that properties (i), (ii) and (vi) of Proposition 7.1\nstill hold for AS\u03bc,l+ ,l\u2212 .\n\n9\n\nOrdinal metrics and norms\n\nIn the spirit of the classical Example 7.1 we define the ordinal (\u03bc, l)-distance\nof R-valued functions f , g. Since dist(f (\u03c9), g(\u03c9)) = |f (\u03c9) \u25bd (\u2212g(\u03c9))| is an\nL-valued function on \u03a9, L being the positive part L+ of R, we can define\ndist\u03bc,l (f, g) := S \u03bc,l (|f \u25bd (\u2212g)|) ,\n\nf, g \u2208 R\u03a9 .\n\nLike at the end of Section 2 the usual properties of a distance hold with a\nrestriction for the triangle inequality,\ndist\u03bc,l (f, g) \u2265\n\nO\n\nand dist\u03bc,l (f, g) = O if f = g ,\n\ndist\u03bc,l (f, g) =\n\ndist\u03bc,l (g, f ) ,\n\ndist\u03bc,l (f, h) \u2264\n\ndist\u03bc,l (f, g) \u2228 dist\u03bc,l (g, h)\n\nif \u03bc is an upper chain measure.\n\n5 If the scale M of \u03bc had the additional structure of an order reversing bijection existing\non M , then the conjugate \u03bc could be defined like for R-valued monotone measures and we\n\u2217\nwould get AS\u03bc,\u2212l\n,\u2212l = AS\u03bc,l+ ,l\u2212 (see [5]).\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n19\n\n\fLet us prove the triangle inequality. Using the triangle inequality of dist, we\nhave for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9:\n|f (\u03c9) \u25bd (\u2212h(\u03c9))| \u2264 |f (\u03c9) \u25bd (\u2212g(\u03c9))| \u2228 |g(\u03c9) \u25bd (\u2212h(\u03c9))|\nwhich entails for x \u2208 L\n{|f \u25bd (\u2212h)| \u2265 x} \u2282 {|f \u25bd (\u2212g)| \u2265 x} \u222a {|g \u25bd (\u2212h)| \u2265 x}.\nBy monotonicity of \u03bc and the dual of (7) we get:\nG\u03bc,|f \u25bd (\u2212h)| \u2264 G\u03bc,|f \u25bd (\u2212g)| \u2228 G\u03bc,|g \u25bd (\u2212h)| .\nThen by Proposition 4.3 (ii) this relation translates to the corresponding quantile correspondences and is maintained if we \u2217-multiply with l (Proposition 4.1\n(iii)). Finally, the result follows by distributivity of \u2217 with \u2294 (Proposition 4.1\n(iv)).\nWe define the ordinal (\u03bc, l)-norm\nkf k\u03bc,l := dist\u03bc,l (f, O) .\nIt has (with \u2227 interpreted as multiplication) the homogeneity property of usual\nnorms,\nka \u2227 f k\u03bc,l = |a| \u2227 kf k\u03bc,l for a \u2208 R ,\nwhich proves with Proposition 7.1 (iii). One also derives the triangle inequality\nkf \u25bd gk\u03bc,l \u2264 kf k\u03bc,l \u2228 kgk\u03bc,l\n\nif \u03bc is an upper chain measure.\n\nImportant special cases with L = M and l = id are the ordinal Ky-Fan\nnorm w.r.t. \u03bc\nkf kO := kf k\u03bc,id\nand the \u03bc-essential supremum (cf. [3] Chapter 9)\nkf k\u221e := kf ksign(\u03bc),id .\nf is called a \u03bc-nullfunction if kf k\u221e = O.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
