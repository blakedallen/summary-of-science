INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the main goals of the experiments with the HADES detector [1] at the heavyion synchrotron SIS18 at GSI/Darmstadt is the search for a direct evidence of in-medium\nmodifications of hadrons via the di-electron (e+ e\u2212 ) channel. This goal is supported by\nvarious theoretical indications concerning an important sensitivity of vector mesons to partial\nrestoration of chiral symmetry in a dense and hot nuclear medium [2]. In particular, as shown\nwithin lattice QCD [3], the chiral quark condensate hq\u0304qi as order parameter of the chiral\nsymmetry breaking decreases with increasing baryon density and temperature. Since hq\u0304qi\nis coupled to the vector meson spectral densities one can expect considerable in-medium\neffects of light vector mesons which manifest themselves, e.g., as resonance mass shifts and\nbroadening of widths [4].\nIn spite of the efforts spent to predictions [5\u201313], there is no commonly accepted and reliably quantitative estimate of the change of the mentioned parameters or spectral functions\nin a nuclear medium. For instance, within the QCD sum rule analysis [5\u20137] the in-medium\nmodification of the vector meson masses in zero-width approximation is dictated by the\ndensity and temperature dependence of the quark condensates. While the two-quark condensate hq\u0304qi can be estimated by a model independent approach with reasonable accuracy,\nthe so far poorly known four-quark condensates like h(q\u0304q)2 i lead to uncertainties for the\n1\n\n\fprediction of the vector meson mass shift [14]. From this point of view, direct measurements\nof the vector meson masses and widths, as being at reach with the high-resolution HADES\ndetector system [1], can also shed light on fundamental problems such as the in-medium\nchange of the four-quark condensate.\nSince the most pronounced vector meson mass shift is expected for large baryon density\nin the nuclear medium, there is the hope to verify the effect in medium-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions at SIS18 energies, where baryon densities up to 3n0 can be reached according to\nmodel calculations [15]. Unfortunately, in the case of heavy-ion collisions such measurements\nface a number of problems related to the expansion dynamics and the spatial inhomogeneity\nof the produced dense matter. Due to the collective expansion, the baryon density n depends\non time so that obviously a time average of the mass shift is to be expected, i.e. the mass\nshift effect is distributed over an interval related to the temporal change of n. Also spatial\nvariations of n will make the situation more complicated.\nTo extract the wanted information on the in-medium meson spectral function in heavyion collisions one has also to take into account that the di-electron spectrum dN/dM 2 as\na function of the di-electron invariant mass M is actually a convolution of the considered\nspectral function and the probability to create the vector meson with given energy and momentum. The latter one usually drops down very fast with the energy making the resulting\ndi-electron spectrum very steep. This can make the identification of the possible mass shift,\nsuperimposed to collision broadening and further in-medium broadening, in particular for\nthe \u03c1 meson, rather difficult. An additional problem arises for the \u03c9 meson because of its\ncomparatively long life time which, however, may change in a dense medium [11]. To measure an in-medium mass shift of the \u03c9 resonance one should obviously separate lepton pairs\nproduced by decays in the dense medium from such ones which originate from decays after\nthe disintegration of the dense system.\nThe aim of the present note is to explore the extension of the usual analysis of the\n2\ninvariant mass spectrum dN/dM\nto the more informative double-differential spectrum\nq\n~ 2 is the transverse mass of the pair with transverse\ndN/dM 2 dM 2 , where M\u22a5 = M 2 + Q\n\u22a5\n\n\u22a5\n\n~ \u22a5 perpendicular to the beam axis. As shown in [16] within a schematic\ntwo-momentum Q\nfireball model, such an extension with suitable kinematical cuts allows to avoid the majority of the above mentioned difficulties in extracting information on the in-medium vector\nmeson spectral function. Here we present results of our calculations of double-differential dielectron spectra in heavy-ion collisions at SIS18 energies obtained within a transport model\nof Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) type.\nII. DI-ELECTRON PRODUCTION AND VECTOR MESON SPECTRAL\nFUNCTION\n\nAs elementary processes for the e+ e\u2212 production we employ pion annihilation \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192\n\u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , direct vector meson decays V \u2192 e+ e\u2212 with V = \u03c1, \u03c9, pion - nucleon and nucleon nucleon bremsstrahlung, and Dalitz decays of mesons, \u2206 and N \u2217 . Pions are produced solely\nin baryonic resonance decays, and these resonances are created either in baryon - baryon\ncollisions via BB \u2192 BB with B = N, \u2206, N \u2217 or in meson - baryon collisions MB \u2192 B\n2\n\n\fwith M = \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c3, while the \"direct vector mesons\" emerge in the elementary reactions\nBB \u2192 V NN or \u03c0B \u2192 V N. Our treatment of these processes is described in some detail\nin [18]. To be specific, let us list our perturbative treatment of the \u03c1 and \u03c9 channels.\nWe use the parameterization [17] of the total cross section \u03c3 vac for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\nin vacuum\nr\nm\u03034\u03c1\n4\u03c0 \u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\n4m2\u03c0\nvac\n\u03c3 (M) =\n1\u2212\n(1)\n3 M\nM 2 (M 2 \u2212 m\u03022\u03c1 )2 + (m\u0303\u03c1 \u0393\u0303\u03c1 )2\nwith m\u0303\u03c1 = 775 MeV, m\u0302\u03c1 = 761 MeV, \u0393\u0303\u03c1 = 118 MeV to generate the in-medium spectrum\nby\n\u03c3(M) = \u03c3 vac (M)\n\nm2\u03c1 (n) A(M; m\u03c1 (n), \u0393\u03c1 (n))\n,\nm2\u03c1 (n = 0) A(M; m\u03c1 (n = 0), \u0393\u03c1 (n = 0))\n\n(2)\n\nm\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1\n1\n.\n2\n\u03c0 (M \u2212 m2\u03c1 )2 + (m\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1 )2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the spectral function is\nA(M; m\u03c1 , \u0393\u03c1 ) =\nwith mass dependent width\n\uf8f63\n\uf8eb p\n2 \u2212 4m2\nM\n\u03c0 \uf8f8\n\uf8edq\n.\n\u0393\u03c1 (n) = \u0393(0)\n\u03c1 (n)\nm2\u03c1 (n) \u2212 4m2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\nBelow we employ certain parameterizations of \u0393\u03c1 (n) and m\u03c1 (n).\nSimilar to the case of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 annihilation, the distribution of in-medium decays of directly\nproduced \u03c1 mesons into e+ e\u2212 follows in local density and pole mass approximation from1\n\u221a\nd\u03c3e+ e\u2212\n= \u03c3\u03c1 ( s) 2M A(M; m\u03c1 (n), \u0393\u03c1 (n)) Br(\u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )\ndM\n\n(5)\n\nwith the branching ratio of Br(\u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) = \u0393(\u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )/\u0393(\u03c1, tot), so that all in-medium\neffects are related to the modification of the vector-meson spectral function. We take the\ndefault value of Br as in vacuum, i.e., assume that the e.m. decay width and the total width\nchange in the same manner. Such a choice of the branching ratio allows us to avoid an\nartificial change of the relative contributions of \u03c1 and\n\u221a \u03c9 mesons (see below for the case of\nthe density dependent \u03c9 mass shift). In Eq. (5), \u03c3\u03c1 ( s) is a parameterization\nof the total\n\u221a\nxy\ncross section. For NN \u2192 NN\u03c1 we use \u03c3\u03c1 = F\u03c1 S (\u03be+x)\n,\nwhere\nx\n=\n(\ns\n\u2212\nm\n(n))/GeV\nand\n\u03c1\nz\nS = 1, F\u03c1 = 1.5 mb, \u03be = 1.4, y = 1, z = 2. In case of N\u2206 (\u2206\u2206) collisions the scaling factor\nS = 0.75 (0.5) is employed. The \u03c0N \u2192 N\u03c1 reaction is similarly parameterized, but F\u03c1 = 1.5\n1 This\n\ncontribution is of sub-leading order (see below), therefore, an estimate of the maximum\nyield at pole position is sufficient here.\n\n3\n\n\fmb, \u03be = 0.018, y = 2.2, z = 3.5.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nAccording to our experience [18], the di-electron spectra roughly scale when changing\nthe mass numbers of the colliding nuclei. We choose, therefore, the scaled cross section\nd\u03c3 scal /dM = \u03c0R2 A\u22122 dN(b = 0)/dM with R = A1/3 1.124 fm. Since we are going to\ndemonstrate the advantage of certain observables for the case of strong medium effects, we\nfocus on central collisions of gold nuclei at a beam energy of 1 AGeV.\n(0)\nFirst we use the parameterization \u0393\u03c1 (n) = a\u0393\u0303\u03c1 , m\u03c1 (n) = m\u0303\u03c1 \u2212 \u2206m\u03c1 with constant\nvalues of a and \u2206m\u03c1 . This is schematic and aimed at verifying the previous finding [16]\nthat a strong in-medium broadening of the vector meson widths smears out the \u03c1 meson\npeak in the invariant mass spectrum, while the double-differential spectrum still allows to\nidentify the \u03c1 peak. This set should also illustrate the separate effects of mass shifts. While\nin [16] a fireball model with thermal and chemical equilibrium was used to calculate the dielectron spectra, here both these conditions are not longer required. Moreover, to contrast\nthe present study with the one in [16] we switch off any rescattering of the \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons\nonce created thus not allowing thermalization and chemical equilibration of these species.\nIn Fig. 1 we exhibit the resulting double-differential cross section d\u03c3 scal /dM dM\u22a5 for the\nparameters a = 3 and \u2206m\u03c1 = 0. Let us first consider the invariant mass spectrum arising by\nthe full M\u22a5 integration (see lower panel in Fig. 1). We are interested in the invariant mass\nregion M > 400 MeV, where obviously the pion annihilation channel \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\ndominates over Dalitz decay and bremsstrahlung contributions. The \u03c9 peak sticks out, but\nthe chosen broadening is so strong that any peak structure, attributable to the \u03c1 meson by\npion annihilation, disappears. Instead, a knee is reminiscent of the \u03c1. This is the general\nexpectation that a spectroscopy of the \u03c1 meson becomes impossible due to broadening [6].\nHowever, selecting an appropriate M\u22a5 window, say 850 MeV < M\u22a5 < 950 MeV, the \u03c1\npeak becomes clearly visible, even for the assumed extreme broadening (see upper panel\nin Fig. 1). Due to phase space weighting, the \u03c1 peak position appears slightly shifted to\nsmaller mass. At the high-M wing the direct \u03c1 contribution and the pion annihilation\nyield compete. The M\u22a5 window around 900 MeV seems most suitable, as it represents a\n\n4\n\n\fcompromise of suppressing unwanted background, not cutting off kinematically the \u03c1 peak,\nand still allowing for sufficient statistics.\nNext let us consider the effect of a mass shift, which is strongest for the \u03c1 meson according\nto many predictions. Fig. 2 demonstrates for a = 3, \u2206m\u03c1 = 150 MeV that the above found\nfeatures are persistent also in case of quite drastic mass shifts. The upper panel in Fig. 2\nillustrates, indeed, that such a strong mass shift of the \u03c1 meson is clearly visible even in\ncase of the strong broadening in the spectrum d\u03c3 scal /dM dM\u22a5 |M\u22a5 =850***950MeV , while for the\nchosen parameters the invariant mass spectrum does not exhibit any \u03c1 peak, due to the\nassumed strong broadening (see lower panel in Fig. 2).\nFigs. 1 and 2 show that for identifying the \u03c9 meson still the invariant mass spectrum\nis enough: For in-medium changes covered by the parameterization of set (i) there is no\nobvious advantage by a particular M\u22a5 selection. The important point here is that the \u03c9\nmeson rides on the pion annihilation background.\nNote that in Figs. 1 and 2 the distributions are according to the spectral function Eq. (3)\nand the phase space; in line with the model assumptions (no density dependence of \u2206mV\nand \u0393V , no rescattering), there is no need of an explicit propagation of the spectral function.\nLet us now turn to temporal and spatial variations of the density which cause an additional distribution of the vector meson decay strength. Also here, the usefulness of the\ndouble-differential cross section with appropriate kinematical cuts still applies. We focus on\nan illustration of the \u03c9 mass shift. Since the \u03c9 in vacuum is a narrow resonance, often it is\nassumed to survive the dense stages during a heavy-ion collision and to decay after freezeout with its vacuum parameters. Therefore, the \u03c9 in-medium spectroscopy is considered as\nmore useful in reactions of elementary projectiles with a nucleus under special kinematical\nconditions in which the \u03c9 is roughly at rest and decays inside the static matter. We would\nlike to analyze here the prospects of the \u03c9 in-medium spectroscopy in heavy-ion collisions.\nIn focusing on the \u03c9 meson, we leave for the moment being the \u03c1 meson parameters\nunattached (i.e., take vacuum parameters) and choose m\u03c9 (n) = m\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b4m\u03c9 n/n0 , \u0393\u03c9 (n) =\n\u0393\u03c9 (n = 0) + \u03b4\u0393\u03c9 n/n0 with \u03b4m\u03c9 = 70 MeV and \u03b4\u0393\u03c9 = 50 MeV entering the spectral function\nof the \u03c9 which is of the form of Eq. (3). Given the still sufficiently narrow width of the\nin-medium \u03c9 we propagate the peak according to local conditions and distribute it at each\ntime instant with the spectral function Eq. (3) and sum up the decay products, cf. Eq. (6).\nThese procedure is acceptable only for sufficiently narrow resonances (see discussion in [19]).\nSince the number of \u03c9 mesons is normalized, an increase of the width means a reduction\nof the peak height. For the selected parameters, the \u03c9 peak for the above in-medium\nparameters has a contribution from in-medium decays and vacuum decays. The first one\nshows clearly the down shift and the smearing due to the density dependence, see lower panel\nin Fig. 3. The vacuum peak sticks not longer so much above the pion annihilation yield.\nThe in-medium and vacuum \u03c9 contributions compete with the \u03c1 contribution from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nannihilation. To increase the relative contribution of in-medium \u03c9 decays, in [20] it has been\nproposed to select low-Q\u22a5 di-electrons which stem from very slow \u03c9 mesons which decay\nin the medium, in contrast to fast \u03c9 mesons which traverse quickly the medium and decay\noutside. This feature is also seen in our simulations for heavy-ion collisions in the upper\npanel in Fig. 3, where we selected di-electrons with Q\u22a5 < 100 MeV: the vacuum contribution\nbecomes significantly less, while the in-medium \u03c9 contribution is clearly seen as a shifted\nbump riding on the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 annihilation background. This is in contrast to the invariant\n5\n\n\fmass spectrum which is integrated over all Q\u22a5 (see lower panel in Fig. 3) where the strong\ncompetition between the wanted \u03c9 meson signal and the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 annihilation background\nmakes a conclusion on a in-medium \u03c9 mass shift difficult. Therefore, the measurement of\nthe double-differential di-electron spectrum at low values of Q\u22a5 offers much better chances\nto verify a \u03c9 meson mass shift. Further cuts, e.g. setting an additional narrow repidity\nwindow around mid-rapidity, suppress too strongly the yield but do not enhance efficiently\nenough the in-medium contribution.\nWith respect to the latest HADES e+ e\u2212 measurement in carbon - carbon collisions, we\nmention that in our simulations of central collisions C + C the Q\u22a5 dependence is similar\nto the case of Au + Au. However, for C + C the \"in-medium \u03c9 shoulder\" appears below\nthe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, since the in-medium \u03c9 contribution is attenuated due to the shorter life\ntime and the smaller volume of compressed nuclear matter. The vacuum decay contribution\ndominates, even for small values of Q\u22a5 .\nFinally, we would like to comment on the above choice of Br = Br vac , which assumes\nthat \u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) and \u0393(\u03c9, tot) scale in the same manner in medium. In contrast, often\nan in-medium change of \u0393(\u03c9, tot) is assumed, and \u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) is kept constant (cf. [15]\nfor a discussion). In the latter case the in-medium contribution is noticeably suppressed, as\nevidenced in Fig. 4. Clearly, this issue, as the treatment of dynamical in-medium effects of\n\u03c1 and \u03c9 on a common footing, needs further investigations.\nIV. SUMMARY\n\nOur results can be summarized as follows: (i) The spectrum d\u03c3/dM dM\u22a5 for 850 MeV\n< M\u22a5 < 950 MeV as a function of M is dominated in the region 400 MeV < M < 800\nMeV by the channel \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 with a pronounced \u03c1 bump. This gives a good\nchance to measure the in-medium \u03c1 meson spectral function by a double-differential dielectron spectrum in heavy-ion collisions at SIS18 energies. (ii) By selecting di-electrons\nwith small enough transverse momentum Q\u22a5 < 100 MeV one can isolate the in-medium\n\u03c9 decay contribution which signals the in-medium mass shift and a broadening of the \u03c9\nmeson. This Q\u22a5 dependence may be useful for future \u03c9 spectroscopy. (iii) Bremsstrahlung\nand Dalitz decays are small in the region M > 400 MeV, for the considered beam energies.\nOur findings, which are not to be understood as quantitative predictions, also show that\nfairly independently of the specific form of the vector meson spectral function the doubledifferential di-electron spectrum with suitable cuts allows a better access to the in-medium\neffects and, therefore, can be an appropriate measurement strategy in HADES experiments.\nAcknowledgments: Useful discussions with H.W.
