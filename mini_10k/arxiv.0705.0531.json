INTRODUCTION\n\nThe hot gas in clusters of galaxies is responsible for inverse Compton scattering cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) photons as they travel through the intracluster\nmedium (ICM). This results in a spectral distortion of\nthe CMB at the location of clusters on the sky, referred to\nas the Sunyaev & Zeldovich (1972) effect (SZE). This distortion is characterized by a low frequency (<218 GHz)\ndecrement, and higher frequency (>218 GHz) increment\nin the CMB intensity (Carlstrom et al. 2002). The X-ray\nemission in clusters consists of thermal bremsstrahlung\nand line emission from the same highly ionized plasma\nthat scatters the CMB.\nHigh resolution X-ray or SZE observations of clusters\ncoupled with assumptions about the gas distribution lead\nto estimates of the gas mass in the cluster dark matter potential well. The electron number density is often\nassumed to fit a \u03b2 model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano\n1978),\n\u0012 \u00132 !\u22123\u03b2/2\nr\nne (r) = ne0 1 +\n.\n(1)\nrc\nIn the above relation, ne0 is the central density normalization and rc indicates the fitted parameter referred to\nas the core radius. Fitting an observed X-ray or SZE profile to these projected \u03b2 model X-ray surface brightness\nand SZE y parameter distributions results in a description of the density distribution, which can be integrated\nto obtain the gas mass. The difference in dependence\non gas density and temperature of X-ray emissivity and\nElectronic address: hallman@casa.colorado.edu\n\nthe SZE y parameter makes the combination of these\ntwo methods of observation potentially very powerful.\nBecause of this difference, the observability of clusters\nvia each method is affected differently by the impact of\nphysics in cluster cores including radiative cooling and\nfeedback mechanisms, as well as the transient boosting\nof surface brightness and spectral temperature generated\nduring merging events (Roettiger et al. 1996; Motl &\nBurns 2005). These two methods not only select a different sample of clusters, but combined SZE/X-ray observations of individual clusters allow one to extract the\ndensity and temperature of the gas without relying on\nX-ray spectral temperatures.\n1.1. Isothermal Beta Models\nUnder the assumption that the gas in clusters is\nisothermal, one can fit an isothermal \u03b2-model to the data\nin order to deduce the density profile. To generate the\nprojected X-ray surface brightness profile, we integrate\nthe \u03b2-model density distribution\nZ\n1\nne (r)nH (r)\u039b(T )dl,\n(2)\nSX =\n4\u03c0(1 + z)4\nwhere in the bremsstrahlung limit, \u039b(T ) \u221d T 1/2 , and in\na fixed X-ray band is more weakly dependent on temperature (Mohr et al. 1999). This integration results in\n\u0012 \u00132 ! 21 \u22123\u03b2\nb\n,\n(3)\nSX (b) = SX0 1 +\nrc\nwhere SX0 is the fitted central X-ray surface brightness of\nthe model, and b indicates the projected radius. Similarly\n\n\f2\nfor the SZE, a \u03b2-model density profile can be integrated\nZ\nkb T\ny = \u03c3T ne (r)\ndl,\n(4)\nme c2\n\nwhich results in a projected radial distribution of the\nCompton y parameter\n\u0012 \u00132 ! 12 \u2212 3\u03b2\n2\nb\n.\n(5)\ny(b) = y0 1 +\nrc\n\nFor very hot clusters (T > 10 keV), relativistic corrections must be included to the SZE integral (Itoh &\nNozawa 2004). While these fits result in a description of\nthe cluster density profile, we must be aware that that\ndescription is only approximate, since it has been shown\nboth in simulations and observations (Loken et al. 2002;\nVikhlinin et al. 2005) that many clusters show a radial\ndependence of temperature. That means that when using\nisothermal models (the above equations) to fit the data,\nwe should expect error to be introduced in the derived\nquantities.\n1.2. SZE/X-ray Derived Quantities\nRecent studies have used the values of the \u03b2-model parameters determined from the X-ray surface brightness\nprofiles combined with SZE cluster observations to determine the value of the Hubble constant (H0 ) (Reese et al.\n2002; Bonamente et al. 2006) and the cluster gas fraction\n(Joy et al. 2001; LaRoque et al. 2006). While joint fits\nof X-ray and SZE interferometric data are used to determine the \u03b2-model parameters in these studies, the X-ray\ndata drives the fit, since the SZE data currently lacks\nthe resolution (and interferometric U-V plane coverage)\nto constrain the parameters well (LaRoque et al. 2006).\nAn additional calculation can be performed using combined SZE/X-ray data from clusters. It is expected both\nfrom analytic arguments and numerical simulations that\nthe integrated SZE signal, as a measure of the total ICM\npressure in clusters, should be an excellent proxy for cluster total mass (da Silva et al. 2000; Motl et al. 2005; Nagai 2006; Kravtsov et al. 2006). This presupposes that\none can determine accurately the value of the integrated\nSZE signal to some mass-scaled cluster radius, as well\nas perform an accurate calibration of this relationship\nobservationally. In Motl et al. (2005), we showed that\nthe value of Y500 , the integrated Compton y parameter inside a radius where \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 = 500 (with respect to\nthe critical density) accurately measures the cluster total mass inside that same radius. In order to accurately\ncalibrate this relationship, one must measure the Y -M\nrelationship to high precision at low redshift, where clusters have combined SZE/X-ray observations to use. Then\nthe measured relation, scaled for redshift, can be used to\ndetermine masses of SZE-selected clusters, which should\nbe indentifiable to high redshifts, in order to constrain\ncosmology.\nSince SZE radial profiles are of relatively poor quality so far, a direct determination of the compatibility of\nthe X-ray \u03b2-model parameters with the SZE profiles in\nclusters can not currently be done observationally. Here\nwe compare the values of \u03b2-model parameters for a large\nnumber of simulated clusters when fitting the X-ray surface brightness profile, the SZE radial Compton y profile,\n\nand jointly fitting both X-ray and SZE profiles to a common \u03b2-model. We show that the use of X-ray parameter\nvalues leads to biased estimates of Y500 , as well as the\nintegrated gas mass M500,gas .\nWe discuss our numerical simulations in Section 2, results of the analysis in Section 3, the consequences of the\nuse of X-ray \u03b2-model parameters for estimating the Y500 M500 relationship for clusters in Section 4, and discussion\nand conclusions in Section 5.\n2. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nOur simulations use the hybrid Eulerian adaptive\nmesh refinement hydro/N-body code Enzo (O'Shea et al.\n(2005); http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/enzo) to evolve both the\ndark matter and baryonic fluid in the clusters, utilizing the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for the hydrodynamics. With up to seven levels of refinement in\nhigh density regions, we attain spatial resolution up to\n\u223c 16 h\u22121 kpc in the clusters. We assume a concordance\n\u039bCDM cosmological model with the following parameters: \u03a9b = 0.026, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7, and\n\u03c38 = 0.9. Refinement of high density regions is performed as described in Motl et al. (2004).\nWe have constructed a catalog of AMR refined clusters\nidentified in the simulation volume as described in Loken\net al. (2002). The catalog of clusters used in this study\nincludes the effects of radiative cooling, models the loss of\nlow entropy gas to stars, adds a moderate amount of supernova feedback due to Type II supernovae in the zones\nwhere stars form, and is identified as the SFF (Star Formation with Feedback) catalog in Hallman et al. (2006).\nThe catalog includes clusters with total mass (baryons +\ndark matter) greater than 1014 M\u2299 out to z=2 in the simulation. This catalog includes roughly 100 such clusters\nat z=0, and has 20 redshift intervals of output, corresponding to a total of roughly 1500 clusters in all redshift\nbins combined.\nFor parts of the analysis, we have cleaned the cluster sample as described in Hallman et al. (2006), removing cool core clusters and obviously disturbed clusters.\nThis is done primarily to more closely mimic observational studies of cluster properties. We examine by eye\nall cluster projections and remove any with obvious double peaks in the X-ray or SZE surface brightness images,\nhave disturbed morphology within R = 1h\u22121 Mpc, exhibit edges consistent with shocked gas, or those that\nhave cool cores. The cool core clusters are identified\nas those with a projected emission-weighted temperature profile which declines at small radius, or those with\nstrongly peaked X-ray emission. The cool core clusters\nare eliminated because as we have shown in Hallman\net al. (2006), they lead to strong biases and increased\nscatter in estimates of cluster physical properties when\nstandard observational methods are used. We show in\nour previous work that eliminating obviously disturbed\nclusters has a minor, but measurable effect on observationally derived quantities. Indeed the simple assumptions that are typically made in the observational derivation (e.g., spherical symmetry, hydrostatic equilibrium)\nclearly do not apply to such clusters. We also use two\northogonal projected images for each cluster. The final cleaned sample contains 493 cluster projected images\nfrom a series of evolutionary epochs from z=0 to z=2.\n\n\f3\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Isothermal \u03b2-model Fits\nWe have generated images of our simulated cluster catalog by projecting the physical quantities on the grid to\nget the value of the SZE Compton y parameter and the\nX-ray surface brightness. For the X-ray, we have used a\nsimple bremsstrahlung emissivity. It is a simpler calculation than using a model X-ray emissivity, and we will\nshow later that the values of the \u03b2-model parameters are\nnearly identical irrespective of which emissivity calculation we use.\nFrom these images, we have created radial profiles in\nannular bins, which we subsequently fit to \u03b2-model profiles. Each cluster, for both the SZE and X-ray profile,\nhas a set of \u03b2-model parameters that describe it, though\nthere is some degeneracy in the parameters in each case.\nThe three \u03b2-model parameters, namely the normalization (SX0 or y0 ), the value of the core radius (rcore ), and\nthe power law index \u03b2 are left as free parameters in the\nfit. We have fit to each of three limiting outer radii in\nboth the SZE and X-ray case, r2500 , r500 , and r200 . In\neach case, the subscript indicates the average overdensity\nwith respect to critical inside that radius. This radius is\ncalculated from the simulation data using the overdensity of the dark matter. We have used the full sample\nfor this part of the analysis, but have excluded the cool\ncore region (typically \u2248100kpc) of the profiles from the\nfitting procedure.\nWe have found that there are significant differences\nin the values of the fitted model parameters depending\non whether the X-ray or SZE profiles are used. Figure 1\nshows the comparison of the values of \u03b2 and rcore plotted\nagainst one another for individual z=0 clusters in our\ncatalog for the three limiting outer radii used. It is clear\nthat there is a large amount of scatter in the relationship\nfor the \u03b2 values, and also at r500 and r200 , a definite\ndiscrepancy. Fitting SZE profiles results in a consistently\nhigher value of \u03b2 than does fitting X-ray profiles. While\nthere is scatter in the compared values of rcore , there\nis general agreement within the errors. However, since\nthere is a degeneracy between rcore and \u03b2 in the fitting,\nsome scatter is expected. Since the values of \u03b2 and rcore\nare used directly in the equation for the density profile,\ninconsistent values for these parameters lead to different\ndeduced density profiles, and discrepant values for the\ncluster gas mass.\nNext, looking at Figure 2, we show the 1\u03c3 scatter in the\nratio of the SZE deduced parameters and the X-ray parameters for each of our three fiducial radii for all clusters\nin our catalog. While there is not a statistically significant bias in rcore , one clearly exists in \u03b2 at the larger\nradii. To answer the question of why the isothermal \u03b2model fit for X-ray and SZE observations give a different\nset of model parameters in each case, consider the simple\nargument in the next section.\n\n3.2.

We have used the redshiftspecific mean value for each cluster in the analysis.\nIf the cluster's true gas temperature declines with radius with the above described dependence\nT (r) \u221d r\u22122\u03b4 ,\n\n(9)\n\nthen the cluster observable profiles have dependence at\nr > rc\nSX (r) \u221d r1\u22126\u03b2\u2212\u03b4\n(10)\nand\n\ny(r) \u221d r1\u22123\u03b2\u22122\u03b4 .\n\n(11)\n\nOur simulations show a typical value of \u03b4 = 0.5 (see Table\n1). If we assume the true cluster density profile is a \u03b2model modified in this way by a UTP for the temperature\nprofile (and \u03b4=0.5), and that the true value for \u03b2 set\nby the cluster density profile is \u03b2=0.8, then the radial\ndependence of X-ray surface brightness and SZE surface\nbrightness are\nSX (r) \u221d r\u22124.3\n(12)\nand\n\ny(r) \u221d r\u22122.4 .\n\n(13)\n\nFinally, if we then fit an isothermal \u03b2-model to cluster\nprofiles with the above dependence, setting powers equal\nfor the X-ray\n1 \u2212 6\u03b2 = \u22124.3\n(14)\nwe would get \u03b2 = 0.88, and for the SZE, the isothermal\nfit would give us\n1 \u2212 3\u03b2 = \u22122.4\n\n(15)\n\nor \u03b2 = 1.13.\nWhile the declining temperature profile has a relatively\nsmall effect on the \u03b2 value extracted from an isothermal\nfit to the X-ray surface brightness (+10%), there is a\nlarger effect on the value of \u03b2 in the SZE case (+41%).\nThis is not surprising given the difference in temperature\n\n\f4\n\nr2500\n\nr2500\n\nr500\n\nr500\n\nr200\n\nr200\n\nFig. 1.- Upper panels: Left panel shows comparison of fitted \u03b2 values for clusters in our numerical sample at z=0 out to r2500 using\nthe X-ray and SZE images.

Table 2 shows\nthe median values of fitted \u03b2 in our cluster sample out to\nr200 , with 1\u03c3 scatter. Indeed the variation between the\nX-ray and SZE fits is consistent with the simple analysis shown above. Also, one line of the table shows the\nresult of fitting the true density profiles extracted from\nthe simulated data. Though the differences between the\ntrue value and the SZE and X-ray fitted values are bigger than expected from a simple analysis, the true value\nis indeed smaller than that fitted from the emission profiles. There are additional sources of bias which may\nbe introduced due to clumpiness in the ICM and deviations from spherical symmetry which may contribute to\n\nthe larger difference in fitted parameters (Sulkanen 1999;\nNagai et al. 2000). There is also the degeneracy in rc and\n\u03b2 in any model fitting to these profiles which can contribute to differences. We also show in the last line of the\ntable the result of fitting the isothermal \u03b2-model to the\nprofile of X-ray surface brightness resulting from a projection of the Raymond-Smith (Brickhouse et al. 1995)\nmodel emissivity. It is clear that the statistical properties of the fitted parameters are nearly indistinguishable\nfrom those fitted to the simple bremsstrahlung model.\nIt is therefore clear that the effect of a declining temperature profile in real clusters is to alter the fitted values\nof \u03b2 in this simple model, such that the SZE isothermal\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- Upper: Ratio of SZE \u03b2 fitted to radial profiles from\nprojections of full SFF simulated sample of clusters to \u03b2 fitted\nto X-ray radial profiles for the same clusters.

Indeed a\nsimilar analysis by Ameglio et al. (2006) has shown results consistent with ours in this regard. We also find\nno significant trend in the SZE/X-ray parameter ratios\nwith redshift.\n3.3. Fitting to a UTP Modified Model\nSince the variation in model parameters between Xray and SZE fitting appears to be due to the failure to\naccount for the radial dependence of temperature in the\n\nintracluster medium, it makes sense to use a model that\nincludes this radial dependence for fitting the surface\nbrightness. Our non-isothermal \u03b2-model for the surface\nbrightness is created by integrating the expression for the\nX-ray surface brightness and Compton y parameter using the standard \u03b2-model for the density, and the UTP\nfor the temperature. We refer to this model as the U-\u03b2.\nIntegrating Equations 2 and 4 with the substitution of\nthe \u03b2-model density profile (Eq. 1) and the UTP (Eq.\n8) results in the fitting relations for the X-ray and SZE\nsurface brightness\n\u0012\n\u00132 !\u2212 2\u03b4\n\u0012 \u00132 !\u22123\u03b2\nb\nb\n1+\nIX (b)\nSX (b) = SX0 1 +\nrc\n\u03b1r500\n(16)\nand\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u00132 !\u2212 3\u03b2\n\u00132 !\u2212\u03b4\n2\nb\nb\n1+\ny(b) = y0 1 +\nISZ (b),\nrc\n\u03b1r500\n(17)\nrespectively, where IX (b) and ISZ (b) are line integrals\ndescribed in the Appendix.\nAs described in Section 3.2, the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b4 are\nfixed in the fitting to the surface brightness distributions,\nand result from fitting of the spherically averaged (from\nthe three-dimensional simulated data) temperature profiles from the simulated clusters. The average values of\nthe parameters in each redshift bin are used for fitting\nthe surface brightness profiles of a cluster in that same\nredshift bin. When fitting the cluster profiles to these\nrelations, we find that there is now consistency in the\nvalues of \u03b2 and rc between X-ray and SZE fitting, shown\nin Figure 3. While there is still some scatter, the offset\nis removed. Table 2 shows the results for all clusters in\nthe sample when fitting to an isothermal \u03b2-model or a\nnon-isothermal (the U-\u03b2) model. The value of \u03b2 is virtually identical in SZE and X-ray fitting when using the\nU-\u03b2. Additionally, they result in similar distributions of\nrc values.\nNote that this model has the same number of free parameters (three) used to fit the surface brightness as a\nstandard \u03b2-model, the others are fixed from simulations.\nWe should note the well-known caveat about \u03b2-model\nfitting, that the values of rcore and \u03b2 are somewhat degenerate in this fitting.\n4. CONSEQUENCES OF THE \u03b2\nINCOMPATIBILITY: EXAMPLE CALCULATION\nOF Y500 VS M\nUsing the isothermal \u03b2-model parameters from a fit\ndominated by the X-ray data to do SZE or combined Xray/SZE analysis introduces an additional error or bias\nto various derived quantities. Here, we characterize the\nnature of these errors on the measured Y500 vs M500,gas\nrelation for clusters. As described in the introduction, it\nhas been shown that the integrated Compton y parameter inside r500 is an excellent proxy for total mass (da\nSilva et al. 2000; Motl et al. 2005; Nagai 2006; Kravtsov\net al. 2006). We examine whether one can accurately determine the true value of Y500 (and M500,gas ) from a cluster observation using standard observational techniques.\nGenerating a value for Y500 using a \u03b2-model fit dom-\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 4.- Upper: Integrated Compton y parameter inside r500\nfrom simulated clusters at z=0 epoch plotted against integrated\nmass inside the same radius.

Currently\nexisting cluster SZE profiles from interferometric instruments do not constrain individual \u03b2-model parameters\nwell. Since we have shown that the isothermal \u03b2-model\nparamters for SZE and X-ray cluster profiles are different, there is an error introduced. Additionally, there are\nerrors introduced in the calculation of the cluster gas\nmass, M500,gas , since in any individual cluster, the \u03b2model for the density deduced from the observations is\nonly approximately correct.\n4.1. Estimation of Y and M\nWe have used the simulated cluster sample described\nabove (SFF) to determine the systematic errors introduced in this procedure. We have analyzed the simulated\nclusters such that our synthetic observations are analogous to unbiased, high signal-to-noise observations of real\nclusters. The simulated observations are idealized, since\nno instrumental effects or foreground/background source\nremoval are simulated. We have performed our calculations on projected SZE and X-ray images generated from\neach simulated cluster, assuming the X-ray profiles could\n\nbe determined to r500 .\nUsing this method, and assuming that the values of \u03b2\nand rc are defined by fitting of the X-ray surface brightness profile, we have characterized errors by taking the\nmodel parameters from the X-ray fitting and calculated\nthe estimated values of Y500 and M500,gas from each cluster. We then compare the value to the true value taken\nfrom the simulation grid.\nWe have used the isothermal model fits and also the\nfits to the U-\u03b2 models. In each case, Y500 is determined\nby extrapolating the model for y(r) using the parameters \u03b2 and rc from the X-ray fitting, and the value of y0\ngenerated by fitting the SZE profile with \u03b2 and rc fixed.\nM500,gas is estimated by integrating the \u03b2 model for density out to an overdensity of 500. This method effectively\nmeasures r500 from the fitted gas density profile in order\nto get the integrated gas mass. For the U-\u03b2 cases, the values of \u03b1 and \u03b4 are fixed at the mean values for the whole\nsample of clusters at each redshift, recognizing that these\nvalues would be provided by simulations, and would not\nbe left as free parameters in the observational analysis.\n4.2. Comparison of Isothermal and U-\u03b2 Methods\nOn first inspection of Figure 4, it is not clear that either\nthe isothermal or U-\u03b2 generates a more accurate result.\nThe plot shows values from all clusters from the z=0\nsimulation epoch. The true values of Y500 and M500,gas\nare plotted as stars, the isothermal model values as diamonds, and the U-\u03b2 model values as triangles.\nThe plot of deviation of these values from the best fit\nto the true values shows some difference between these\ntwo methods. However, it is important to remember that\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 6.- Plot of eight clusters on the Y500 -M500,gas relation\nchosen to span a wide mass range, but otherwise randomly. Stars\nindicate the true values from the simulation, red diamonds the\nisothermal \u03b2-model estimates, and blue triangles the U-\u03b2 model\nestimates. Lines link points associated with the same cluster.\n\nFig. 5.- Upper: Plot of the ratio of estimated Y500 to its\ntrue value (y-axis) versus the ratio of estimated M500,gas to its\ntrue value for 493 simulated cluster projections for isothermal\n\u03b2-model fits. Lower: Ratio of estimated Y500 to its true value\nversus the ratio of estimated M500,gas to its true value for\nU-\u03b2-model fits. Lines indicate location of perfectly accurate\nestimation of each quantity.\n\nthere are deviations from both the true integrated SZE,\nand the true gas mass, so these points deviate in both dimensions of the plot. Since errors in both are correlated,\ndue to the dependence on the determination of r500 from\nthe \u03b2-model, this should reduce the apparent separation\nof points from the best fit, even when the values of both\nparameters are in error.\nThis important point is illustrated in Figure 5, which\nshows the the ratios of estimated to true values of Y500\nand M500,gas for each cluster. In both the isothermal\n(upper plot) and U-\u03b2 (lower plot) methods, there is a\nclear trend in over and underestimation in both values.\nThese figures also illustrate nicely the improvement in\nvalues one gets with the U-\u03b2 method. The U-\u03b2 points are\nclustered more strongly around the correct values than\nare the isothermal estimates. This effect is illustrated in\nFigure 6, where we have plotted the true values of y and\nM , with lines indicating the corresponding estimates of\n\nthose values for the isothermal and U-\u03b2 methods. There\nare typically overestimates in both estimated Y500 and\nM500,gas , and the use of the U-\u03b2 typically brings the\nestimated values back toward the true.\nThe outliers in these plots are also interesting. The\nclusters which give strong overestimates of Y and Mgas\ntypically result from line-of-sight overlap of multiple\nstructures. This enhances the integrated SZE signal in\nprojection, but overestimates the true value for the main\ncluster. The clusters with low estimated values of Y\nand/or Mgas typically have poor quality \u03b2-model fits (as\nmeasured by a \u03c72 statistic), and appear to have systematically low fitted values for the core radius. Some of\nthese clusters appear to have weak cool cores, not meeting the cool core criteria, and thus were not excluded\nfrom the sample. It is interesting that the clusters with\nmass underestimates do not all generate underestimates\nof Y . This effect warrants further study.\nTable 3 also shows the result of this analysis. When\nusing isothermal models, the median estimated value of\nY500 is 23% larger than the true value (the mean is a\n28% overestimate). Additionally, when estimating the\ngas mass, the median estimated value is a 16% overestimate. In previous work (Hallman et al. 2006), we have\nshown that the magnitude of the overestimate via X-ray\n\u03b2-model methods is lower than this, but in that case we\nassumed one could correctly calculate the value of r500\nwith no error. In either case, this overestimate is consistent with our previous work, and with that of others\n(Mohr et al. 1999; Mathiesen et al. 1999). The overestimate in mass results from substructure, merging and\nother physical processes not described by a simple model.\nIn the current analysis, the value of r500 is deduced directly from the \u03b2-model. In contrast, the U-\u03b2 method\ngets closer to the correct value for Y500 , with a median\nvalue 11% higher than the true value. For the mass, the\nU-\u03b2 method gets an estimate close to the true mass, a\nmedian overestimate of only 4%.\n\n\f8\nTABLE 3\nRatio of Estimated to True Values of Simulated Cluster\nProperties to r500\n\nhy500,est /y500,true i\n(y500,est /y500,true ), median\n1\u03c3 upper\n1\u03c3 lower\nhM500,gas,est /M500,gas,true i\n(M500,gas,est /M500,gas,true ), median\n1\u03c3 upper\n1\u03c3 lower\n\nIsothermal\n1.28\n1.23\n1.50\n1.08\n1.17\n1.16\n1.31\n1.06\n\ndependence of the X-ray emission on density minimizes\nthe error introduced by variations in cluster temperature.\nWe show that fitting either the X-ray or SZE profiles to a\nmodified, non-isothermal \u03b2-model corrected by the inclu-\n\nU-\u03b2\n1.13\n1.11\n1.24\n1.03\n1.05\n1.04\n1.18\n0.94\n\nFig. 8.- Histogram of 493 simulated cluster projections of ratio\nof estimated M500,gas to true value for isothermal (black lines) and\nU-\u03b2 (red lines) methods.

In mass, the result is a reduced bias\nin the median values with a slight improvement in the\nscatter as shown in Figure 8.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThere is an inconsistency between X-ray and SZE fitted\nmodel parameters that leads to a bias in deduced values\nof Y500 and M500,gas when using isothermal \u03b2-models.\nUsing our U-\u03b2 model reduces the bias and scatter, resulting in a more precise and accurate determination of\nthe y-M scaling relation for clusters.\nX-ray and SZE radial profiles from the same galaxy\ncluster can not be fit well by identical isothermal \u03b2models. The stronger dependence of the SZE emission\non temperature leads to problems when the cluster temperature declines with radius. In contrast, the strong\n\nsion of a univeral temperature profile for clusters results\nin better consistency with the real values of Y500 and\nM500,gas .\nWe expect this inconsistency should affect measurements of the Hubble constant at some level, indeed it\nappears to result in a bias in H0 , as shown by Ameglio\net al. (2006). There will certainly be an effect on gas fraction determinations, though it will also depend on any\nbias inherent in X-ray hydrostatic total mass estimates.\nWhile current precision in SZE/X-ray derived quantities\nis not high enough to reveal effects at the 10-20% level of\nthe type described here, we expect it will be higher with\nlarger samples and new instruments available in the near\nterm. When contemplating clusters as precision cosmological tools, effects as this level must be considered.\nWhile some have used double \u03b2-models (LaRoque et al.\n2006) to fit cluster radial profiles with some success, a\nmodel like the U-\u03b2 is preferred, since it is physically motivated by the observed ICM properties. This work illustrates a simple modification of the isothermal \u03b2-model\nto more realistically account for cluster physics, and thus\nmore accurately and precisely measure cluster properties.\nThe simulations presented in this work were conducted\nat the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\nat the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign through\ncomputer allocation grant AST010014N.

We have created a calculator for the line integral in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), which\nis available on-line at http://solo.colorado.edu/ hallman/UTP/Ib calc.tar.gz.\nREFERENCES\nAmeglio, S., Borgani, S., Diaferio, A., & Dolag, K. 2006,\nMNRAS, 369, 1459\nBonamente, M., Joy, M.
