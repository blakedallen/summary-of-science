We explain that\nthe emergent incoherence is linked to the unlocking of iron fluctuating moments which are almost\ntemperature independent at short time scales. Finally, we make explicit suggestions for improving\nthe thermoelectric performance of FeSi based systems.\nIron based narrow gap semiconductors such as FeSi,\nFeSb2 , or FeGa3 show a pronounced resemblance to\nheavy fermion Kondo insulators in their charge [1\u20134] and\nspin [4, 5] degrees of freedom. Besides, these systems\ndisplay a large thermopower [1, 3, 6\u20138, 11], heralding\ntheir potential use in solid state devices. There are two\ncomplementary approaches for explaining these unusual\nproperties : On one hand it has been proposed that lattice degrees of freedom play a crucial role [7, 17, 20]. On\nthe other hand, electron-electron correlation effects have\nbeen invoked on the basis of both experimental results [2\u2013\n4, 8], as well as theoretical model studies [12, 13, 15, 18],\nadvocating in particular Hubbard physics [12, 15, 18],\nspin fluctuations [13], spin-state transitions [16, 17], or a\nthermally induced mixed valence [18].\nHere, we go beyond modelistic approaches and investigate the effect of correlations on prototypical FeSi from\nthe ab initio perspective. The key issues that we address are (1) can electronic Coulomb correlations alone\nquantitatively account for the signatures of the temperature induced crossover in various observables, and (2)\nwhat is the underlying microscopic origin of this behavior ? As a realistic many-body approach, we employ the\n\nA(\u03c9)\n\narXiv:1109.6561v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 13 Feb 2012\n\nPACS numbers:\n\n-0.2\n\u03c9 [eV]\n\n\u03c9min x10\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 1: Local spectra and susceptibility.

Transfers of spectral weight over\nscales related to the Coulomb interaction U rather than\nthe gap \u2206 are usually considered a hallmark of correlation effects [25]. Recent ellipsometry measurements [24]\nshowed spectral weight transfers over several eV. In Fig. 2\nwe compare our realistic optical conductivities \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) to\nexperiment [23, 24]. Both, the overall magnitude and the\ncrucial temperature evolution are well captured : Cooling\ndown from 400K depletes spectral weight below 80meV,\nwith only parts of it being transfered to energies just\nslightly above the gap. To analyze this in more detail,\nwe follow Menzel et al.[24] and plot in Fig. 3 the temperature difference \u2206N (\u03c9) = NT1 (\u03c9) \u2212 NTR2 (\u03c9) of the ef\u03c9\neV\nd\u03c9 \u2032 \u03c3(\u03c9 \u2032 , T )\nfective number of carriers NT (\u03c9) = 2m\n\u03c0e2\n0\nas a function of energy. An intersection with the x-axis\ncorresponds to a full recovery of spectral weight as is imposed by the f-sum rule. Our theoretical results quantitatively trace the experimental temperature dependence.\nWe note that there are several isosbectic points in the\noptical conductivity, Fig. 2, which lead to extrema in\n\u2206N (\u03c9) in Fig. 3. The first peak in \u2206N is at 80meV,\nthe scale of the semiconducting gap, above which spectral weight starts to pile up at low temperature in \u03c3(\u03c9).\nThe first minimum in \u2206N (\u03c9) occurs at the second isosbectic point at around 0.18eV, up to where only \u223c 35%\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) [103/\u03a9cm]\n\n4\nTheory\n3\n2\n387K\n193K\n116K\n\n1\n\n290K\n145K\n77K\n\n0\n\u03c3(\u03c9) [103/\u03a9cm]\n\nFig. 1 shows our theoretical local spectral function of\nFeSi at various temperatures [orbital and momentum resolved spectra can be found in the supporting information]. At low temperature, the spectrum is similar to that\nobtained within band-theory [16\u201318], albeit with a gap\nrenormalized by a factor of about 2, in agreement with\nphotoemission spectroscopy (PES) [27, 28]. [42] The electronic excitation spectrum is thus band-like and coherent\nat low temperature. As was noted earlier [16\u201318], the gap\nedges are very sharp in this regime, indicating a potentially large thermopower [29]. At higher temperatures,\nfeatures broaden, and the system becomes a bad metal as\nfound experimentally [27, 28]. We stress that this effect\nis largely beyond a mere temperature broadening of the\nelectron distribution (Fermi) function [2, 27, 28]. Due to\nthe asymmetry of the spectrum, the position of the gap\nmoves with temperature : In agreement with PES [27, 28]\nthe minimum \u03c9min of the spectrum [depicted in Fig. 1]\nstarts out near the middle of the gap (as expected for a\nsemiconductor[11]), then first moves up with increasing\ntemperature. Above 300K, \u03c9min again approaches the\nFermi level, as the asymmetry is reversed.\n\ncompensation of excess carriers is achieved for the theoretical curve. As is clear from Fig. 3, \u2206N (\u03c9) does not\nvanish over the extended energy range plotted, hence a\ntotal compensation is not reached below the scale of the\nCoulomb repulsion of 5 eV.

Experimental\nresults from [24], used temperatures as indicated.\n\nTHERMOPOWER\n\nFeSi boasts a notably large thermopower at low temperatures [1, 6, 7]. Yet, it is compatible in magnitude\nwith a Seebeck coefficient of purely electronic origin : For\na band-like semiconductor in the regime kB T < \u2206, the\nelectron diffusive thermopower cannot exceed \u2206/T [11].\n\n\f3\nFrom this perspective, a larger gap favors the thermopower. While validated in FeSi, the above constraint\nis violated in the related compound FeSb2 [3, 8, 11].\nGiven the dominantly electronic picture, in conjunction\nwith the band-like nature of FeSi at low temperature, the\nSeebeck coefficient in that regime can be accounted for\nby band theory : Indeed, it was shown that a slightly hole\ndoped band-structure yields good agreement below 100K\n[17]. As shown in Fig. 5, we confirm this by supplementing band-theory with an effective mass of 2 and 0.001\nholes/Fe. While a dependence on stoichiometry is seen\nin experiments[6], the tiny amounts of extra holes should\nbe viewed as a means to alter the particle-hole asymmetry [11] rather than an effect of excess charge. As is well\nknown, the particle-hole asymmetry plays a major role\nin determining the thermopower, since electron and hole\ncontributions have opposite signs. The convention is that\na negative Seebeck coefficient is dominated by electron\ntransport, and a positive one by holes. It is interesting\nto note that for an insulator a large thermopower is expected near thermoelectric particle/hole symmetry[11],\nwith a large sensitivity to the exact imbalance of carriers. Scanning through electron and hole doping, FeSi is\nexperimentally indeed placed near such a boundary [30].\nAs expected, introducing an effective mass alone fails\nat higher temperatures. It has been conjectured (but\nnot calculated) that this could be accounted for by thermal disorder via the electron-phonon coupling [17, 20].\nOn the other hand, model studies indicated compatibility\nwith the picture of Coulomb correlations [31]. In Fig. 5\nwe display the Seebeck coefficient obtained from our realistic many-body calculation. The agreement with experiments is very good. Notably, the theory captures\nthe overall suppression of the thermopower above 100K,\nwhich comes from an enhanced conductivity due to the\naccumulation of incoherent weight at the Fermi level. In\nthis sense incoherence is detrimental to semi-conductor\nbased thermopower. Note however that correlation effects can substantially enhance the Seebeck coefficient of\ncorrelated metals [see e.g. [32]].\nThe temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient\nin Fig. 5 is connected to the moving of the chemical potential discussed above : As a function of rising temperature, the chemical potential first moves down, thereby\nincreasing the electron contribution to the thermopower\n[11]. At some temperature thermoelectric particle-hole\nsymmetry is passed, and the Seebeck coefficient is dominated by electrons (S < 0), while at higher temperatures,\nthe trend is reversed, and S becomes positive again.\nWe note that the conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices is measured by the so-called figure of merit\nZT = S 2 \u03c3T /\u03ba. Here, the combination S 2 \u03c3 of the Seebeck coefficient S and the conductivity \u03c3 is called the\npower factor (PF), and \u03ba is the thermal conductivity.\nThe power factor of FeSi, displayed in Fig. 4(b), peaks at\naround 60K, where is reaches more than 40\u03bcW/(K 2 cm),\n\ni.e. it reaches values comparable to state of the art Bi2 Te3\n(at its maximum value at 550K), and is for T \u2265 60K\nlarger than in FeSb2 that holds the overall record PF\n(realized at 12K)[3].\n\nMICROSCOPIC INSIGHTS\n\nThe quantitative agreement of our theoretical results\nwith a large panoply of experimental data validates our\napproach, thus signaling the paramount influence of electronic correlation effects. Drawing from the microscopic\ninsights of our method, we now address the physical picture underlying the intriguing properties of FeSi. This\nwill in particular allow us to propose ways to improve\nthe thermoelectrical properties of FeSi.\n\nCrossover to the Metallic State\n\nWithin our theoretical picture, the crossover to bad\nmetallic behavior is not caused by a narrowing of the excitation gap [see the supporting information for details].\nInstead, it is filled with incoherent weight that emerges\nwith increasing temperature. Information about the coherence of the one-particle excitations are encoded in the\nimaginary parts of the electron self-energy \u03a3. For the\nrelevant orbital components we find I\u03a3(\u03c9 = 0) \u2248 \u2212aT 2\nwith a = 1.9 * 10\u22124 meV/K2 . I\u03a3 thus reaches the value\nof \u2206/2 at around 400K, when only a pseudogap remains\n[see Fig. 1].\nComplementarily, it was proposed that the arguably\nlarge electron-phonon coupling [7, 20, 24] causes the closure of the gap via thermal induced atomic disorder\n[17, 20]. In molecular dynamics simulations [20], the\ngap \u2206DF T was shown to vanish abruptly for temperatures of the order of T \u2248 \u2206DF T /2, in contrast to the\ngradual transition that is observed in experiment and\nreproduced by our theory. We note that also in other\nsystems with large electron-phonon coupling, spectral\nweight transfers are quantitatively accounted for by electronic correlations[33].\n\nStrength of Correlations\n\nA recurring question in condensed matter physics\nis whether a system is well described in either an\nitinerant or a localized picture. Both the low effective mass of FeSi (m\u2217 /m\u22481.5) and the rather high\nkinetic energy Ekin \u2248\u221210.5eV of the iron states signal a large degree of delocalization. Indeed, other\niron compounds show significantly higher masses and\nlower kinetic energies, e.g. the pnictides BaFe2 As2\n(Ekin [eV];(m\u2217 /m)xy )\u2248(\u22127; 3) and CaFe2 As2 (\u22128; 2.5) or\nthe chalcogen FeTe (\u22126.5; 7)[23]. Accordingly, FeSi is\n\n\f4\nan only moderately correlated, itinerant material. Yet,\neffects of correlation induced incoherence are essential\nfor the crossover to the metallic state. This seeming\ncontradiction is resolved by noting that all relevant energy scales are of similar magnitude. Indeed : O(\u2206) \u2248\nO(I\u03a3) \u2248 O(T ) \u2248 O(50meV), which leads low energy\nproperties to be correlation dominated.\n\nThe Spin State\n\nA major signature of the unconventional behavior of\nFeSi is the non-monotonous uniform magnetic susceptibility [5]. The latter is closely mimicked\nby our local\nR\nspin susceptibility \u03c7loc (\u03c9 = 0) \u223c \u03b21 d\u03c4 hSz (\u03c4 )Sz (0)i [see\ninset of Fig. 1], indicating compatibility with the picture of electronic correlations. Interestingly there is a\ndistinction of time scales : While \u03c7loc (\u03c9 = 0) \u2013 the timeaveraged response \u2013 displays a strong temperature dependence, the spin response at very short time scales, as\nprobed by the observable lim\u03c4 \u21920 hS(\u03c4 )S(0)i, is virtually\ntemperature independent. p\nFrom the latter, we obtain\nan effective moment M = S(S + 1)gs \u2248 3 (gs = 2).\nThis is consistent with major contributions from effective iron states with S = 1 [see supporting information\nfor details], and in agreement with M = 2.7 as obtained\nfrom fitting the experimental susceptibility [5] to a Curie0 \u03bcB\nM 2 /(T \u2212 TC ) for T > 400K. We note\nWeiss law \u03c7 = \u03bc3k\nB\nthat the local susceptibility [see inset of Fig. 1] is about\none order of magnitude smaller than the experimental\nuniform susceptibility. Hence, the temperature induced\nfluctuating moment of the underlying spin state is, to a\nlarge extent, not local. This is corroborated by neutron\nexperiments[35] that find a significant magnetic scattering at \"ferromagnetic\" reciprocal lattice vectors.\nSince the effective moment M is constant, FeSi thus\ndoes not undergo a spin-state transition as is found e.g.\nin MnO or LaCoO3 . There it originates from a competition between the Hund's coupling J and the crystal field\nsplittings. In FeSi, the splitting of low energy excitations\nis given by the gap \u2206, which is much smaller than the\nHund's coupling J, thereby favoring the high spin configuration.\nThe preponderance of S=1 states in particular implies\nthat FeSi is not a singlet insulator as previously proposed\n[16, 17]. We further find that FeSi is in a mixed valence\nstate. We obtain an iron valence of Nd \u2248 6.2, with a\nlarge variance \u03b4N = h(N \u2212 hN i)2 i \u2248 0.93 [see supporting information for details]. However, these numbers are\ninsensitive to temperature, thus excluding a thermally\ninduced mixed valence [18].\nInterestingly, we find that our results are one order of\nmagnitude more sensitive to the strength of the Hund's\nrule coupling J than to the Hubbard interaction U [for\ndetails see the supporting information]. This effect is\nreminiscent of the physics of Hund's metals as found in\n\niron pnictides and chalcogenides[22, 23], and is quite different from Hubbard physics in which the Hubbard U\nreduces charge fluctuations and the time-scale associated\nwith them, while the time averaged local spin susceptibility is strongly enhanced. In contrast, only the spin fluctuations but not the charge fluctuations are short-lived\nin FeSi, resulting in only a moderate enhancement of the\n(time averaged) local spin susceptibility, but a strongly\nenhanced short time (energy averaged) fluctuating magnetic moment.\n\nTHE PHYSICAL PICTURE\n\nWe are now in the position to elucidate the fundamental picture of FeSi : (a) What is the physical origin of\nthe crossover in the susceptibility ? (b) How is the latter\nlinked to the emergence of incoherent spectral weight, i.e.\nwhat is the relation between the crossovers for the spin\nand charge degrees of freedom ?\nAt low temperatures, FeSi is a conventional band-like\nsemiconductor, i.e. it is approximately described by an\neffective one-particle Hamiltonian that can be diagonalized in momentum space. Excitations are well-defined\n(coherent). The system is in a high spin state, but spin\nexcitations are gapped, and so the spin susceptibility is\nsmall as fluctuations at finite time scales are quenched. In\nthis sense the spin degrees of freedom are inactive. With\nincreasing temperature, however, a fluctuating moment\ndevelops at the iron sites. The emergence of such a locking to the real-space lattice breaks down the momentumspace description : k is no longer a good quantum number, hence excitations acquire a finite lifetime broadening, and the spectrum becomes incoherent.\nOut theory goes beyond previous theoretical proposals,\nindeed it reconciles (and validates by including explicitly\nthe Si degrees of freedom) two seminal model-based approaches : The model of Fu and Doniach[12] that addressed the evolution of the one particle spectrum, and\nwhich can serve as a simplified cartoon of our realistic\ncalculation, and the spin-fluctuation theory of Takahashi\nand Moriya[13] which is compatible with our results for\nthe spin degrees of freedom. Here, we claim that the\ncrossovers in the spin and charge response are actually\nintimately linked to each other.\nDue to the complicated multi-orbital nature of the\nproblem, there are however important differences from\nprevious model calculations[12, 15, 18] : In the realistic\ncase the relevant control parameter is the Hund's coupling J rather than the Coulomb interaction U [see the\nsupporting information]. Furthermore, we account for\nthe particle/hole asymmetry. Indeed, for a symmetric\nmodel [12], the Seebeck coefficient \u2013 a key feature of this\nsystem \u2013 is zero at all temperatures, and the chemical\npotential is pinned to its value at 0K.\n\n\f5\n100\nTheory\nWolfe et al\nBocelli et al\nPaschen et al\nSales et al\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\nS \u03c3 [\u03bcW/(K cm)]\n\n\u03c1 [m\u03a9cm]\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\nTheory\nWolfe et al\n\n10\n1\n0.1\nSales et al\npolycryst.\nsingle cryst.\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800 1000 1200\n\n10\n\nT [K]\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nT [K]\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 4: Resistivity and Powerfactor.

This material features a competitive\npower factor in the temperature range of 50-100K. Our\ntheory suggests concrete ways to improve that already\nremarkable thermoelectric performance. First, as is becoming standard practice in thermoelectric development\n[38], nano\u2013 or heterostructuring is needed to reduce thermal conductivity to convert the good power factor into\na large figure of merit. More important yet, the power\nfactor can be improved further by increasing the charge\ngap, through a reduction of the ratio of Hund's coupling\nover bandwidth, or an increase in the inter-atomic hybridizations that cause the band-gap. To achieve this\n\ngoal, we propose experimental studies of FeSi under external pressure[39], or by compressing the lattice using\na suitable substrate. A particularly interesting option\nwould be partial iso-electronic substitution of iron with\nruthenium[40]. Not only does the iso-structural RuSi\nhave a larger gap than FeSi, and itself a notable Seebeck coefficient above 100K[41], but also the fluctuating moment physics that drives the metalization and the\nquenching of the thermopower in FeSi could be effectively reduced, as well as the thermal conductivity decreased via the alloying. To our knowledge these avenues\nhave not been pursued vis-\u00e0-vis their impact onto thermoelectricity. More generally, the theory outlined here,\ndescribes the subtle interplay of electron\u2013electron correlations and thermoelectricity, adding a new host of systems amenable to theory assisted thermoelectric material\ndesign.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank P.

The dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)[3] impurity problem is solved using a hybridization expansion continuous time quantum monte\ncarlo (ctqmc) method [4, 5]. We use a projection based\nDFT+DMFT setup with full charge self-consistency, as\nimplemented in Ref.[6]. For the Coulomb interaction and\nHund's coupling, we use the value U = 5.0eV, J = 0.7eV,\nrespectively, which have been found appropriate for iron\nbased compounds[7]. For the dependence of results on J,\nsee the discussion in the extended results section, below.\nMETHOD : THERMOPOWER CALCULATIONS\n\nThe electronic contribution to the thermopower along\nthe \u03b1-direction, i.e. the diagonal element S\u03b1 = S\u03b1\u03b1 of\nthe Seebeck tensor, can be written as (see e.g. Ref.[8\u201312])\nS\u03b1 = \u2212\n\nkB A\u03b1\n1\n|e| A\u03b1\n0\n\nwith the Fermi level \u03bc and the Fermi function f\u03bc .

FeSi crystallizes in the B20 structure\nwith the cubic space group P21 3, and four iron atoms\nper unit cell. The ligand arrangement splits the 3d orbitals into 1/2/2 for which we find the corresponding\nmajor characters z 2 /x2 -y 2 + xy/xz + yz, with the latter\ntwo multiplets separated by an avoided crossing. With\na nominal iron valence of 6, FeSi is an insulator within\nband theory[16\u201318]. Owing to the hybridization nature\nof the gap, and the absence of bandwidth narrowing effects \u2013and contrary to most other semi-conductors\u2013, DFT\ncalculations overestimate the gap by a factor of about 2 :\n\u2206DF T \u2248 0.11eV[16\u201318].\nOrbital and momentum resolved Spectra and Influence of Incoherence. In Fig. 6 (a) we display the\nDFT+DMFT spectral function, resolved into orbital\ncharacters of the Fe 3d manifold (different line types)\nand for two temperatures (red and blue). The gap (or\npseudo gap, depending on the temperature) is formed\nmainly by orbitals of x2 \u2212 y 2 and xy character on the\nvalence, and xz and yz on the conduction side. Besides\nthe moving of the chemical potential [see discussion in\nthe main text], the spectral weight at the Fermi level\n\n\f9\nis increased at larger temperatures by effects of incoherence rather than a closing of the gap though a shifting of\nexcitations. In the following, we shall justify this claim.\nThe impurity Greens function (of atom \u03c4 and orbital\nL = (l, m)) is given by\nG\u03c4LL (\u03c9) = [\u03c9 \u2212 (ELimp + \u2206\u03c4LL (\u03c9) + \u03a3\u03c4LL (\u03c9))]\u22121 (8)\nwhere Eimp are the impurity levels, \u2206(\u03c9) the hybridization function, and \u03a3(\u03c9) the self-energy, and we have assumed all quantities to be diagonal in the local basis (for\ndetails see e.g. [6]). A good idea about the major features in the excitation spectrum can be gained (see e.g.\nRef.[19]) by analyzing the poles of the Greens function\nin the absence of lifetime effects, i.e. by\n\u03c9 = ELimp + R\u2206\u03c4LL (\u03c9) + R\u03a3\u03c4LL (\u03c9)\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is shown in Fig. 6 (b) where the intersections with\nthe black line mark the graphical solutions for the above\nequation. As expected, poles in the occupied part are of\nx2 \u2212 y 2 and xy character, whereas as for \u03c9 > 0 solution\ncan be found for the xz and yz components.\nThe interesting observation here is that those poles\nslightly move further apart when the temperature is\nraised, i.e. the gap in the quasi-particle band-structure\nactually becomes larger. Yet at the same time, as is\nevident from Fig. 6 (c), the imaginary part of the selfenergy increases drastically. The values of I\u03a3 are seemingly small, but they are comparable in magnitude to the\nexperimental charge gap (50 \u2212 55meV). Fig. 6(d) shows\nthat the values at the Fermi level of the relevant orbital\ncomponents of I\u03a3 follow up to 400K a T 2 law with a coefficient a = \u22121.9 * 10\u22124 meV/K2 . Assuming Lorentzian\nline shapes, the combined half-width-at-half-maximum of\nthe conduction and valence bands reaches the size of the\ngap below 400K : 2I\u03a3(\u03c9 = 0, T = 363K) = 50meV.\nYet, we note that the filling of the gap is gradual and already at lower temperatures, there appears finite incoherent weight at the Fermi level. This is different from the\nclosure of the gap in the picture of thermal disorder[20],\nmentioned in the manuscript, where the bridging of the\ngap occurs rather abruptly for T \u2248 \u2206/2. Also, due to\nthe particle/hole asymmetry, the chemical potential falls\ninto the middle of the gap only at T=0 [see also the main\ntext, and Fig.1 there]. This further lowers the temperature at which sizable incoherent weight appears at low\nenergy.\nFor accessing lower temperatures in the Seebeck coefficient than is possible for the Monte Carlo to reach (see\nthe main manuscript, and, there, the unconnected points\nin Fig. 4), we extrapolate the imaginary parts of the selfenergy of the run at the lowest temperature following the\nT 2 behavior described above.\nIn Fig. 7, we further show the total spectral function\nmomentum-resolved along various symmetry lines, and\nfor two temperatures. As was evident already from the\n\nlocal spectra, excitations broaden significantly with temperature. Also seen is the slight moving apart of the peak\nintensities at higher T, i.e. the widening of the gap as\ngiven by the poles of the Greens function discussed above.\nWhile the incoherent spectral weight at the Fermi level is\nnot discernible on the used color scale, it is evident that\nthe crossover to a (bad) metallic state is not caused by\nthe introduction of a \"band\" crossing.\nCharge Carrier Concentration As a reference, we further provide, in Fig. 8, the temperature dependence of\nthe carrier concentration, extracted from our data by two\ndifferent means :\n(1) from the spectral function.\nUsing n =\nR\u221e\nR0\n1\n1\nV 0 d\u03c9f (\u03c9)A(\u03c9) and p = V \u2212\u221e d\u03c9f (\u2212\u03c9)A(\u03c9) with\nthe unit-cell volume V and the local spectral function\nA(\u03c9) we compute the number of electrons and holes, respectively. We find that the net carriers are holes at all\ntemperatures (p \u2212 n > 0). This is to be contrasted with\nthe Seebeck coefficient that from low to high temperatures changes from p-type to n-type and back to p-type,\ndemonstrating that particle-hole symmetry for different\nresponse functions can be distinct.\n(2) from the restricted sum-rule of the optical conductivR\u2206\n\u03c0e2\nity. Using 0 d\u03c9\u03c3(\u03c9) = 2m\n\u2217 nef f with a gap \u2206 = 60meV\nand the orbital averaged effective mass m\u2217 = 1.5m, we\nfind values for the number of effective carriers that are\nin good agreement with those obtained from the oneparticle spectrum.\nWe however note that, in particular at low temperatures, extrinsic effects that are not included in our calculation can potentially have a large effect on the number\nof carriers. Indeed the sign of the Hall coefficient seems\nto be notably sample dependent.\nDependence of Results on the Hund's coupling. In\nFeSi there is no direct competition between the Hund's\ncoupling J and the crystal field splittings, as e.g. manifest\nfrom the energy difference between the poles of the impurity Greens function (see above). The latter is about\n0.3eV, while the Hund's coupling used for our calculations is more than twice as large : J = 0.7eV. Still, there\nis a notable dependence on the value of J (see also the\nrecent Ref. [21]) : In Fig. 9 (a) are displaced the effective\nmasses m\u2217 /m as obtained from the slope of the local selfenergy at the Fermi level, as well as (b) the imaginary\npart of the self-energy at the Fermi level.\nAs was found previously for other iron based\nmaterials[22, 23] as well as 4d systems[24], the effective masses increase significantly with J. The charge\ngap as shown in Fig. 9 (c) shrinks accordingly. The\ngeneral mechanism and systematics behind this are investigated e.g. in Ref.[23, 24, 24\u201327], and can be explained by resorting to a description in terms of a selfconsistent Kondo problem[25]. A large Hund's rule coupling constraints electrons to same spin, different orbital\nstates, thereby \"orbitally blocking\"[23] the Kondo inter-\n\n\f10\naction, which in turn decreases the coherence temperature exponentially[25]. As a consequence, also the imaginary part of the self-energy, as shown in Fig. 9 (b), grows\nsignificantly in magnitude when increasing J. For our\nmain calculations, we use the value J = 0.7eV which is\nfound to be typical for iron based compounds[7].\nSpin state. The figures Fig. 10(a) and (b) contain\nthe histograms of the ctqmc[4] for two different temperatures : Shown is the probability distribution of the manybody wave-function onto the eigenstates of the effective\niron atom representing the 3d orbitals, decomposed into\nthe number of particles N and the spin state S. The main\nconclusions that we can draw from these results are\n\u2022 the decomposition onto N and S is almost independent of temperature, but strong fluctuations at\nshort time-scales are present.\n\u2022 the system is strongly mixed valence, since\nthe charge variance is of order 1 : \u03b4N =\n2\nh(N \u2212 hN i) i \u2248 0.93.\n\u2022 the spin state S=1 has the overall largest probability at all temperatures,\nyielding an effective mop\nment M = S(S + 1)gs \u2248 3 (gs = 2), with variance \u03b4S = h(S \u2212 hSi)2 i \u2248 0.33.\nThus, while the variances of S and N are large, they\ndo not evolve with temperature. This is in strong contrast to systems like MnO, or LaCoO3 in which spin-state\ntransitions occur [28\u201331].\nWe note that without averaging over states with\nthe same S, the single most probable state has\n(N ,S)=(7,1.5), closely followed by (N ,S)=(6,2). This\nis similar to other iron systems like e.g. the pnictide\nBaFe2 As2 [23]. However, in BaFe2 As2 the most prominent states have a probability that is larger by a factor\nof 4 than most other states [23], while the distribution of\nstates of FeSi is remarkably uniform, as indicated by the\ncharacter of the state averaged S.\n\n[1] Blaha P, Schwarz K, Madsen GKH, Kvasnicka D, Luitz J\n(2001) Wien2k, an augmented plane wave plus local orbitals program for calculating crystal properties.
