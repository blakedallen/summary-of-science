It describes the dynamics of a two-level\natom strongly interacting with a single mode of the quantized radiation field in the rotating-wave approximation\n(RWA). This model has been extensively studied in the\npast three decades [2, 3]. Purely quantum effects predicted by the model, such as Rabi oscillations and collapses and revivals of the atomic inversion operator, have\nbeen observed in the experiments both with microcavities [4, 5, 6] and with trapped ion systems [7].\nIn cavity quantum electrodynamics, the JC model describes the strong-coupling regime of micromasers and of\none-atom lasers. A realistic description of these systems,\nhowever, must take into account the photon losses due\nto imperfect reflectivity of the cavity mirrors. Cavity\nlosses have been described in the literature by means of\na phenomenological master equation of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i [HJC , \u03c1] + \u03b3 a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 a\u2020 a\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1a\u2020 a , (1)\n2\n2\nwhere \u03c1 is the density matrix of the atom-cavity system, HJC is the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, and \u03b3\nrepresents the rate of loss of photons from the cavity,\nand where we have put ~ = 1. The second term on the\nr.h.s. of Eq. (1) has been derived microscopically in the\nframework of a different physical problem, i.e., the one\nwherein the system is given by the quantized cavity mode\nonly, losing excitations because of its interaction with the\nsurrounding electromagnetic field in the vacuum state [9].\nIn this paper we will show that, when the system consists not only of the cavity mode, but also of the twolevel atom interacting with the cavity, the fully microscopic derivation gets more complicated, and in general\nthe master equation for the atom-cavity system is not of\nthe form given by Eq. (1). We will show that only under\ncertain conditions the phenomenological master equation\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: matteo.scala@fisica.unipa.it\n\ncoincides with the microscopic one. These conditions are\ntypically met in the cavity QED experiments, and this explains the extensive and successful use of Eq. (1) for the\ndescription of the dynamics of the JC model with losses.\nThe knowledge of the limitations of the phenomenological model, however, allows us on the one hand to point\nout some misuse of the model, e.g., for the study of the\ndamping of highly excited quasi-classical states [8]. On\nthe other hand it paves the way to the correct description\nof photon losses in the case of structured reservoirs, e.g.\nfor photonic bandgap cavities. Moreover, our derivation\nbrings to light the microscopic processes which occur in\nthe open system dynamics, and therefore how decoherence and dissipation come into play.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we give\na short review on the JC model and on the usual phenomenological description of losses in this model. In\nSec. III we present the microscopic derivation of the JC\nmodel with cavity losses, for the general case of a T temperature electromagnetic reservoir. In Sec. IV we describe the dynamics for the case of one initial excitation\nin the atom-cavity system, we solve the master equation\nand we compare it with the solution of the phenomenological model existing in the literature. In Sec. V we\nbriefly discuss some situations in which the use of the\nmicroscopic model could lead to substantial differences\ncompared to the phenomenological model, suggesting experimental situations in which such differences could be\nobserved, and finally we present conclusions.\nII. THE JAYNES-CUMMINGS MODEL AND\nTHE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF\nLOSSES\n\nSince its introduction, in 1963 [1], the JC model has\nbeen one of the most used models for the description\nof radiation-matter interaction in quantum optics [2], in\nparticular in cavity quantum electrodynamics [4], and in\nion traps [7]. In this section we briefly review some of its\nfeatures.\nLet us consider a two-level atom and denote by |gi and\n|ei the ground and excited state, respectively. The energy\nseparation between the two states is given by ~\u03c90 , with\n\n\f2\n\u03c90 the Bohr frequency. The resonant interaction between\nthe atom and a mode of the electromagnetic field, in the\nRWA and in units of ~, is described by the following\nHamiltonian [1]:\nHJC\n\n\u0001\n\u03c90\n\u03c3z + \u03c90 a\u2020 a + \u03a9 a\u03c3+ + a\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 ,\n=\n2\n\n(3)\n\nfor N \u2265 1, while the ground state and the corresponding\nenergy eigenvalue are\n|E0 i = |0, gi ,\n\nE0 = \u2212\n\n\u03c90\n,\n2\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i [HJC , \u03c1]\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1 \u2020\na a\u03c1 + \u03c1a\u2020 a\n+ \u03b3 [n(\u03c90 ) + 1] a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n,\naa \u03c1 + \u03c1aa\n+ \u03b3n(\u03c90 ) a \u03c1a \u2212\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a\u2020 (a) is the creation (annihilation) operator of the\nmode, \u03c3\u2212 = |gi he|, \u03c3+ = |ei hg|, and \u03c3z = |eihe| \u2212 |gihg|.\nIt is straightforward to show that the total number\nof excitations in the atom-cavity system, given by N =\na\u2020 a + \u03c3z + 1/2 , is a constant of motion. This allows to\ndiagonalize easily the Hamiltonian HJC . One finds the\nfollowing eigenstates and eigenvalues [2]:\n1\n|EN,\u00b1 i = \u221a (|N, gi \u00b1 |N \u2212 1, ei) ,\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c90 \u00b1 \u03a9 N,\nEN,\u00b1 = N \u2212\n2\n\nhas the form\n\n(4)\n\nrespectively, where |N, ii = |N i|ii, with i = e, g, indicates the tensor product of the Fock state |N i and the\nelectronic states |ii.\nFrom the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of HJC one\ncan calculate the evolution of the system given any initial\nconditions. Well known examples of system dynamics\nare Rabi oscillations of the atomic state population, and\ncollapses and revivals of the oscillations when the mode\nis initially in a coherent state [2].\nIn cavity quantum electrodynamics the main source\nof dissipation originates from the leakage of cavity photons due to imperfect reflectivity of the cavity mirrors.\nA second source of dissipation and decoherence, namely\nspontaneous emission of photons by the atom, is mostly\nsuppressed by the presence of the cavity, and therefore\nits effect is usually neglected.\nThe dissipative dynamics of the quantized modes of the\nradiation field inside the cavity in absence of the atom,\ni.e., when the atom is not inside the cavity, can be derived microscopically assuming that the cavity modes are\ncoupled with the electromagnetic field outside the cavity,\nwhich represents a reservoir at temperature T [9]. The\ntypical approach to the description of the losses in the JC\nmodel consists in assuming that the presence of the atom\ninside the cavity does not modify strongly the mechanism of cavity losses, which therefore can be modelled\nby the above mentioned master equation. It is worth\nstressing further, however, that this approach is purely\nphenomenological, since it does not take into account, in\nthe microscopic derivation, the presence of the atom inside the cavity. The phenomenological master equation\n\n(5)\n\nwith n(\u03c90 ) the average number of quanta of the reservoir in the mode of frequency \u03c90 , and \u03b3 the rate of loss\nof cavity photons. We note that for a zero-T reservoir\nthe master equation above reduces to the one given by\nEq. (1). Equations (1) and (5) have been assumed to be\nvalid in most of the earlier studies dealing with the JC\nmodel with losses, for example in [3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nThe use of the master equations given by Eqs. (1)\nand (5) has also been motivated by the fact that in many\ncavity QED experiments the atoms fly through the cavity and actually remain inside the cavity only for a short\ntime. This could induce one to think that the effect\nof their presence inside the cavity might be negligible.\nWe believe, however, that a comparison with a microscopic master equation describing the coupling of the entire atom-cavity system with a reservoir of electromagnetic modes at T temperature is highly desirable and it\nmay both provide a justification of the validity of the\nphenomenological model under the typical experimental\nconditions and put into evidence the physical contexts\nwhere the use of such a model may be unjustified. This\nis the main motivation of the results we will describe in\nthe following sections.\nWe begin, in the next section, by presenting the general formalism, reviewed, e.g., in Ref. [15], to derive a\nmaster equation for the open quantum system of interest\nstarting from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the total\nclosed system (system+environment). We will then compare the master equation we obtain with the one given\nby Eq.

The external environment is that part of the\ntotal closed system other than the system of interest. The\nHamiltonian of the total closed system is given by\nH = HS + HE + Hint ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere HS and HE , are the system and environment\nHamiltonians, respectively, and Hint is the systemenvironment interaction Hamiltonian which is taken to\n\n\f3\nbe of the form\nHint = A \u2297 E,\n\n(7)\n\nwith A = A\u2020 and E = E \u2020 Hermitian operators acting\non the system and on the environment Hilbert spaces,\nrespectively.\nWe expand the interaction Hamiltonian Hint by means\nof the relations\nX\nA =\nA(\u03c9),\n\u03c9\n\nA(\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\n\u03a0(\u01eb)A\u03a0(\u01eb\u2032 ),\n\n(8)\n\nThe RWA, instead, is valid as long as the relaxation time\nof the system is much longer than the typical timescale of\nthe free evolution of the quantum system, i.e., when the\nmaximum of the rates \u03b3(\u03c9) is much smaller than the minimum difference between the Bohr frequencies relative to\nHS [15]:\n\u03b3max \u226a \u2206\u03c9min .\n\n(12)\n\nIn the rest of this section we will apply this general formalism to the description of cavity losses in the JaynesCummings model.\n\n\u01eb\u2032 \u2212\u01eb=\u03c9\n\nwhere \u03a0(\u01eb) is the projector onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue \u01eb of the operator HS and the\nsum is taken over all the Bohr frequencies relative to HS .\nFollowing the standard procedure, i.e., writing down\nthe Liouville-von Neumann equation for the total density\noperator in the interaction picture with respect to HS +\nHE , performing the Born-Markov and the rotating wave\napproximations, tracing out the environmental degrees of\nfreedom and then going back to the Schr\u00f6dinger picture,\none obtains the following master equation for the reduced\ndensity operator \u03c1 of the system [15]:\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u2212i[HS , \u03c1(t)]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n1\b \u2020\n\u2020\nA (\u03c9)A(\u03c9), \u03c1(t)\n+\n\u03b3(\u03c9) A(\u03c9)\u03c1(t)A (\u03c9) \u2212\n2\n\u03c9>0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n1\b\nA(\u03c9)A\u2020 (\u03c9), \u03c1(t) ,(9)\n+ \u03b3(\u2212\u03c9) A\u2020 (\u03c9)\u03c1(t)A(\u03c9)\u2212\n2\n\u03c9>0\nwhere the relation A(\u2212\u03c9) = A\u2020 (\u03c9) has been used and\nwhere we have neglected the renormalization term [15].\nThe coefficients \u03b3(\u03c9) are given by the Fourier transform\nof the correlation functions of the environment:\nZ +\u221e\n(10)\n\u03b3(\u03c9) =\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9\u03c4 E \u2020 (\u03c4 )E(0) ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the environment operators are in the interaction\npicture.\nWe stress once more that the formalism presented\nabove is valid as long as we can perform three approximations: weak coupling or Born approximation, Markovian\napproximation and rotating wave approximation. It is\nworth recalling that the Markovian approximation can\nbe seen as a coarse-graining in time, and therefore holds\nas long as the correlation time of the reservoir \u03c4 is much\nsmaller than the characteristic time scale of the system\ndynamics t\nt \u226b \u03c4.\n\n(11)\n\nB.\n\nApplication of the general formalism to the\nJaynes-Cummings model\n\nWe model the environment as a collection of quantum\nharmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium at T temperature and we assume that the interaction Hamiltonian\nis linear in both the electromagnetic field of the cavity\nmode and the position operators of the harmonic oscillators, i.e.,\nHS = HJC , HE =\n\nX\n\n\u03c9k b\u2020 b,\n\nk\n\nHint =\n\na+a\n\n\u0001X\n\u2020\nk\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\ngk bk + b\u2020k ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u03c9k the frequencies of the environment oscillators, b\u2020k\n(bk ) the creation (annihilation) operator of quanta in the\nk-th environmental mode, and gk the coupling constants.\nFor this system, the operators A(\u03c9), defined in Eq.

(18), which differs from\nEq. (19) for the presence of the interaction energy term\nin HJC [See Eq. (2)].\nWe conclude this section noting the limit of validity of\nour microscopic master equation. From Eqs. (3) and (12)\nwe deduce that the RWA we have performed is valid as\nlong as the smallest difference between Bohr frequencies\nrelative to HJC is much larger than the highest decay\nrate of the system, i.e.\n2\u03a9 \u226b \u03b3max ,\n\n(16)\n\n(20)\n\nsince the typical evolution timescale of the system is given\nby the inverse of the Rabi frequency 2\u03a9.\n\nA. The phenomenological master equation in the\ndressed-state approximation and its relation with\nthe experiments\n\nIn the first part of this section we examine an important feature of the phenomenological master equation\ngiven by Eq. (1) which explains its success in describing\naccurately most of the cavity QED experiments.\nIn [11, 12, 13] it has been shown that, in a regime very\nclose to the one in which our microscopic master equation\nis valid, i.e. for \u03b3 \u226a \u03a9, one can approximate the phenomenological master equation by means of the so-called\ndressed-state approximation. In a later paper [8] the validity of this approximation was carefully analyzed and it\nwas discovered that it actually requires the stronger condition \u03b3 \u226a \u03a9/(2N 3/2 ) in order to be valid. The dressedstate approximation amounts at neglecting, in the interaction picture with respect to the Hamiltonian HJC ,\nall the time-dependent terms oscillating at frequencies\nwhich are multiple of \u03a9, under the hypothesis that this\nfrequency is much larger than the decay rate \u03b3.\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, the set of coupled differential equations for the matrix elements, in the dressedstate approximation, hEN,+ | \u03c1\u0307 |EN,+ i, hEN,\u2212 | \u03c1\u0307 |EN,\u2212 i\nand hEN,\u00b1 | \u03c1\u0307 |EN,\u2213 i coincide with the corresponding set\nof equations obtained from our master equation (16) at\nzero temperature, when the spectrum of the environment\nis flat, i.e. in the case of white noise. In other words, our\nmicroscopic approach justifies the validity of the dressedstate approximation in terms of a microscopic systemreservoir interaction model, and explains the success of\nthe phenomenological master equation in fitting the experimental data in the strong coupling regime, i.e., when\nthe relaxation time is much longer than the frequency of\n\n\f5\nthe Rabi oscillations [5]. It is worth stressing, however,\nthat if the spectrum of the environment is not flat the\npredictions of the two master equations differ also in the\nlimit of weak damping since, in this case, the differential\nequations for the relevant matrix elements obtained from\nour microscopic master equation do not coincide with the\ndifferential equations obtained from the phenomenological master equation after performing the dressed-state\napproximation [11, 12].\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nP0,g\n0.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nIn the next subsection we present a comparison between the predictions of the phenomenological and microscopic master equations at zero temperature when\nthe system has one initial excitation. We will concentrate on a finite (three) dimensional subspace using the\nphenomenological model without the dressed-state approximation, because the restriction of Eq. (1) to such a\nsubspace gives rise to an exactly solvable dynamical case.\nSince our microscopic model gives the same predictions\nof the dressed-state approximation for the phenomenological model, the examples we are going to consider in\nthe next subsection will give us also insight in the limits\nof validity of the dressed-state approximation itself.\nAs we will see in the following, the discrepancy between\nthe phenomenological master equation (without dressedstate approximation) and the microscopic master equation is indeed appreciable already at the first order in\n\u03b3/\u03a9. Consequently, for the value of the parameters considered in our examples, the applicability of the dressed\nstate approximation to the phenomenological model appears to be questionable.\n\nB.\n\n1.\n\nDynamics at T = 0 with one initial excitation\n\nDecay of the Rabi oscillations with the atom initially\nexcited\n\nWe assume the initial state of the system is |0, ei. In\nabsence of cavity losses one would observe a continuous exchange of energy between the atom and the cavity\nmode, namely the Rabi oscillations. The interaction between the cavity and the environment causes the loss of\nenergy from the atom-cavity system to the external environment. Since in the system there is only one initial\nexcitation and the environment is at zero temperature,\nthe number of excitations cannot increase in time and\nEq.

(1) (phenomenological master\nequation).\nIn both cases, the ground state population of the atomcavity system increases in time with the same exponential rate, due to the cavity losses. There is, however,\nan important difference in the behavior predicted by the\ntwo equations. Indeed, while our microscopic master\nequation predicts a purely exponential increase, the phenomenological master equation predicts the presence of\noscillations at the Rabi frequency superimposed to the\nexponential increase. As anticipated, the amplitude of\nthese oscillations is of the order of \u03b3/\u03a9. This difference\nin the ground state population dynamics reflects different\nphysical mechanisms in the dissipation process. According to the phenomenological master equation, given by\nEq. (1), only the cavity can directly lose excitations, as\none can see from the form of the dissipator. The rate of\nloss is indeed proportional to the population of the state\n|1, gi only, while the state |0, ei does not directly decay.\nIn this sense the oscillating behavior of the population of\nthe ground state is a signature of the Rabi oscillations\nwhich induce the system decay via the coupling of the\nstate |0, ei to the state |1, gi.\nThe microscopic master equation given by Eq. (16),\nwith \u03b3 (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03a9) = \u03b3 (\u03c90 + \u03a9), predicts instead that both\nthe states |1, gi and |0, ei decay with the same rate, since\nthey are both superpositions of the states |E1,+ i and\n|E1,\u2212 i. For this reason there is no oscillating behavior\nin the time evolution of the population of |0, gi.\nThe difference between the predictions of the phenomenological master equation and those of the microscopic master equation can be revealed by performing\njoint measurements on both the atom and the cavity, in\norder to get the population of the state |0, gi of the composite system.\nWe can observe a difference in the system dynamics\nalso measuring the population of the atomic ground state,\ngiven by Pg (t) = h0, g| \u03c1(t) |0, gi + h1, g| \u03c1(t) |1, gi.

In fact in the case of the Bell state we just\nneed a way to experimentally distinguish between the\natomic excited and ground state, for example by means\nof a static electric field which ionizes the excited state\nonly, as shown in [5].\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIVE\nREMARKS\n\nIn the previous section we have seen that our derivation of the dissipative dynamics of the JC model with\nlosses, taking into account the presence of the atom inside the cavity, allows to give a microscopic description of\nthe interaction between the atom-cavity open quantum\nsystem and the external electromagnetic field.\nIt appears evident from our results that, although the\nsource of the losses is the escape of photons through the\ncavity mirrors, it is the atom-cavity system as a whole,\ni.e. the atom dressed by the cavity mode, which comes\ninto play in the dissipative dynamics. Stated another\nway, while the jump operators appearing in the phenomenological master equations, given by Eq. (1), are\nthe annihilation and creation operators of photons in the\ncavity (a, and a\u2020 ), those appearing in the microscopic\nmaster equation [See, e.g., Eq. (21)] describe transitions\nbetween the dressed states of the atom-cavity system.\nA noteworthy point emerging from our analysis is that\nthe deviations of the exactly solved phenomenological\nmodel from our microscopic model (coinciding with the\none obtained from the phenomenological model with the\ndressed-state approximation) are of the first order in \u03b3/\u03a9.\nFor this reason it should be possible to check experimentally the predictions of the microscopic model with the\nset up currently used in cavity QED experiments.\nIt is worth stressing that in Eq. (1) only one cavity loss\nrate \u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3(\u03c90 ), with \u03b3(\u03c9) given by Eq. (10), appears.\nOn the contrary, in Eq. (21), the loss rates corresponding to jump operators connecting the ground state with\nthe states |E1,+ i and |E1,\u2212 i are different, and more precisely they are given by \u03b3(\u03c90 + \u03a9) and \u03b3(\u03c90 \u2212 \u03a9), respectively. This clearly indicates that, when the spectrum\nof the reservoir is not flat, the phenomenological master equation does not provide a description which can be\njustified in terms of a microscopic system-reservoir interaction model as the one we have considered.\nIn the light of the considerations made above we expect that, already in the weak coupling regime, differences between our approach and the phenomenological\none should become evident in those physical contexts\nwhere the reservoir is structured, e.g. in photonic band\ngap materials and hybrid solid-state cavity QED systems [17, 18, 19].\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nS.M. and J.P. acknowledge financial support from the\nAcademy of Finland (projects 206108, 108699), and the\nMagnus Ehrnrooth Foundation.\nM.S. thanks the Quantum Optics Group of the University of Turku for the kind hospitality during the period\nMay-August 2006.\n\n\f8\nAPPENDIX\n\nIn this appendix we recall the method of the damping\nbasis introduced in Ref. [14] to solve master equations,\nand we apply it to Eq. (21).\nGiven a master equation of the form\n\u03c1\u0307 = L\u03c1,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere L is a time-independent linear superoperator acting on \u03c1, one considers the following eigenvalue problem\nL\u03c1\u03bb = \u03bb\u03c1\u03bb ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u03bb is a right eigenoperator of the superoperator L\nwith eigenvalue \u03bb. When the set of right eigenoperators\n{\u03c1\u03bb } is a basis for the space of linear operators acting on\nthe Hilbert space of the system, as in the case analyzed\nin this paper, any density operator can be expanded with\nrespect to this set.\nIt is easy to show that if the system starts from the\ninitial condition\nX\n\u03c1(0) =\nc\u03bb \u03c1 \u03bb ,\n(30)\n\u03bb\n\nthen the time evolution of the system is then given by\nX\n\u03c1(t) =\nc\u03bb e\u03bbt \u03c1\u03bb\n(31)\n\u03bb\n\nThe coefficients {c\u03bb } of the decomposition in Eq. (30)\nare given by\nc\u03bb = Tr {\u03c1\u030c\u03bb \u03c1(0)} ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u030c\u03bb is the solution of the left eigenvalue problem\n\u03c1\u030c\u03bb L = \u03bb\u03c1\u030c\u03bb ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the set of left eigenvalues {\u03bb} is the same as in the\nright eigenvalue problem [14].\nWhen the dimension of the Hilbert space one considers is finite and equal to n, the superoperator can be\nrepresented by a non-hermitian n2 \u00d7 n2 matrix. The\nright eigenoperators, if they exist, are represented by n2 component column vectors, while the left eigenoperators\nare represented by n2 -component row vectors.\nApplying this method to Eq. (21), we have to look for\nthe nine right eigenoperators of its superoperator. For\nsimplicity we call \u03b3a = \u03b3 (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03a9) and \u03b3b = \u03b3 (\u03c90 + \u03a9).\nSix of the nine right eigenoperators are given by\nthe coherences |E0 i hE1,\u2212 |, |E0 i hE1,+ |, |E1,\u2212 i hE1,+ |\nand their hermitian conjugates, with eigenvalues respectively equal to i (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03a9) \u2212 \u03b3a /2, i (\u03c90 + \u03a9) \u2212\n\u03b3b /2, i(2\u03a9) \u2212 (\u03b3a + \u03b3b ) /4 and their complex conjugates.\nThe other three right eigenoperators\nare given by |E0 i hE0 |, (|E1,\u2212 i hE1,\u2212 | \u2212 |E0 i hE0 |),\n(|E1,+ i hE1,+ | \u2212 |E0 i hE0 |) with eigenvalues respectively\nequal to 0, \u2212\u03b3a /2 and \u2212\u03b3b /2.\n\nBy expanding the initial state with respect to these\nnine eigenoperators, one can then compute the evolution\nof the system under the initial conditions given in part\nB of Sec. IV.\nWhen the initial state is \u03c1(0) = |0, ei h0, e| one obtains\nthe following density operator at time t\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 \u03b3a t 1 \u2212 \u03b3b t\n2\n2\n|E0 i hE0 |\n\u2212 e\n\u03c1(t) = 1 \u2212 e\n2\n2\n1 \u03b3b\n1 \u03b3a\n+ e\u2212 2 t |E1,\u2212 i hE1,\u2212 | + e\u2212 2 t |E1,+ i hE1,+ |\n2\n2\n\u0001\n1 \u03b3a +\u03b3b\n\u2212 e\u2212 4 t e2i\u03a9t |E1,\u2212 i hE1,+ | + h.c. ,\n2\n\n(34)\n\nwhich allows us to express the population of the state\n|0, gi as follows\n1 \u03b3a\n1 \u03b3b\nP0,g (t) = h0, g| \u03c1(t) |0, gi = 1 \u2212 e\u2212 2 t \u2212 e\u2212 2 t .

(36) are to be compared with\nthe corresponding quantities computed using the phenomenological master equation, given by Eq. (1), and\nconsidering the same initial condition.
