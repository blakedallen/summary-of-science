INTRODUCTION\n\nThere has been much interest in the phenomenon of localization of gravity proposed\nby Randall and Sundrum (RS) [1]. They assumed a positive three-brane embedded in the\n5D anti de Sitter (AdS5 ) spacetime. They obtained a localized gravity on the brane by\nfine-tuning a brane tension to a bulk cosmological constant. Recently, several authors have\nstudied cosmological implications of the braneworld scenarios. We wish to mention that the\nbrane cosmology contains some important deviations from the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) cosmology [2,3].\nOn the other hand, it is generally accepted that curvature perturbations produced during\ninflation are considered to be the origin of inhomogeneities necessary for explaining cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropies and large-scale structures. The WMAP [4],\nSDSS [5,6], and other data put forward more constraints on cosmological models. These show\nthat an emerging standard model of cosmology is the \u039bCDM model. Further, these results\ncoincide with theoretical predictions of the slow-roll inflation based on general relativity\nwith a single inflaton. The latest data [6] shows a nearly scale-invariant spectrum with the\nspectral index ns = 0.98+0.02\n\u22120.02 , no evidence of the tensor-to-scalar ratio with R < 0.36, and\nno evidence of the running spectral index with \u03b1s \u2243 0.\nIf the brane inflation occurs, one expects that it provides us quite different results in the\nhigh-energy region [7\u201314]. Since the Gauss-Bonnet term modifies the Friedmann equation\nat high-energy significantly, its application to the brane inflation has been studied widely in\nthe literature [15\u201321].\nIn this work, the patch cosmological models induced from the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld\nare introduced to study the brane inflation for large-field, small-field, and hybrid potentials.\nWe use mainly the leading-order spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio to select which\npatch model with q is suitable for explaining the latest observation data.\nThe organization of this work is as follows. In Section II we briefly review the patch cosmology arisen from the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario, and introduce relevant inflation\nparameters as observables. We introduce various potentials to compute their theoretical\nvalues and compare these with the observation data in Section III. Finally we discuss our\nresults in Section IV.\nII. PATCH COSMOLOGICAL MODELS\n\nWe start with an effective Friedmann equation arisen from the Gauss-Bonnet brane cosmology by adopting a flat FRW metric as the background spacetime on the brane1 [11,15,17]\nH 2 = \u03b2q2 \u03c1q ,\n\n(1)\n\n1 For\n1\n2\u03ba25\n\nreference, hhere we add \u0010the action for the Gauss-Bonnet\nscenario: S =i\n\u0011i R braneworld\n\u221a h\n\u221a\n4\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n5\n+ R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\n+ brane d x \u2212g \u2212 \u03bb + Lmatter\nbulk d x \u2212g5 R \u2212 2\u039b5 + \u03b1 R \u2212 4R\u03bc\u03bd R\n\nR\n\nwith \u039b5 = \u22123\u03bc\u03032 (2 \u2212 \u03b2) for an AdS5 bulk and Lmatter\nfor inflation. Its\nh\ni exact Friedmann equation\n2\n2\n1/2\n2\n2\nis given by a complicated form: 2\u03bc\u0303(1 + H /\u03bc\u0303 )\n3 \u2212 \u03b2 + 3\u03b2H /\u03bc\u0303 = \u03ba25 (\u03c1 + \u03bb).\n\n1\n\n\fTABLE I. Three relevant models and their parameters classifying patch cosmological models.\nmodel\nGB\nRS\nGR\n\n\u03b2q2\n(\u03ba25 /16\u03b1)2/3\n\u03ba24 /6\u03bb\n\u03ba24 /3\n\nq (\u03b8)\n2/3 (\u22121)\n2 (1)\n1 (0)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a, q is a patch parameter labelling different models and \u03b2q2 is a factor with\nenergy dimension [\u03b2q ] = E 1\u22122q . An additional parameter \u03b8 = 2(1 \u2212 1/q) is introduced\nfor convenience. We call the above defined on the q-dependent energy region as \"patch\ncosmology\". We summarize three different models and their parameters in Table I. \u03ba25 =\n8\u03c0/m35 is the 5D gravitational coupling constant and \u03ba24 = 8\u03c0/m2Pl is the 4D gravitational\ncoupling constant. \u03b1 = 1/8gs is the Gauss-Bonnet coupling with the string energy scale gs\nand \u03bb is the brane tension. Relationships between these are given by \u03ba24 /\u03ba25 = \u03bc\u0303/(1 + \u03b2) and\n\u03bb = 2\u03bc\u0303(3 \u2212 \u03b2)/\u03ba25 , where \u03b2 = 4\u03b1\u03bc\u03032 \u226a 1, \u03bc\u0303 = 1/l with AdS5 curvature radius l. The RS\ncase of \u03bc\u0303 = \u03ba24 /\u03ba25 is recovered when \u03b2 = 0. We have to distinguish between GB (\u03b2 \u226a 1,\nbut \u03b2 6= 0 exactly) and RS (\u03b2 = 0) cases.\nBefore we proceed, we note that the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld affects inflation only when\nthe Hubble parameter is larger than the AdS curvature scale (H \u226b \u03bc\u0303). As a result, we have\nthe two patch models of GB case with q = 2/3 and RS case with q = 2 case. For the other\ncase of H \u226a \u03bc\u0303, one recovers the 4D general relativistic (GR) case with q = 1. Furthermore,\nwe assume that all of AdS curvature scale \u03bc\u0303, Gauss-Bonnet coupling \u03b1, and brane tension\n\u03bb are stable, even if the vacuum energy on the brane is so large in the high-energy regions\nthat H \u226b \u03bc\u0303.\nLet us introduce an inflaton \u03c6 whose equation is given by\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212V \u2032 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere dot and prime denote the derivative with respect to time t and \u03c6, respectively. The\nenergy density and pressure are given by \u03c1 = \u03c6\u03072 /2 + V and p = \u03c6\u03072 /2 \u2212 V . From now on, we\nuse the slow-roll formalism for inflation: an accelerating universe (\u00e4 > 0) is being derived\nby an inflaton slowly rolling down its potential toward a local minimum. Then Eqs.(1) and\n(2) take the following form approximately:\nH 2 \u2248 \u03b2q2 V q , \u03c6\u0307 \u2248 \u2212V \u2032 /3H\n\n(3)\n\nwhich are the background equations for patch cosmological models. It implies that the\ncosmological acceleration can be derived by a fluid with a vacuum-like equation of state\np \u2248 \u2212\u03c1. If p = \u2212\u03c1 for \u03c6\u0307 = 0, this corresponds to a de Sitter inflation with a(t) = a0 eHt .\nThis is a model to obtain gravitational waves from the braneworld scenario [22]. In order for\ninflation to terminate and for the universe to transfer to a radiation-dominated universe, we\nneed a slow-roll mechanism. To this end, we introduce Hubble slow-roll parameters (\u01eb1 , \u03b4n )\nand potential slow-roll parameters (\u01ebq1 , \u03b4nq ) as\n\u01eb1 \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u1e22\n1 dn+1 \u03c6\nq (V \u2032 )2\nq\n\u2248\n\u01eb\n,\n\u03b4\n\u2261\n\u2248 \u03b4nq\n\u2261\nn\n1\n2\n2\n1+q\nn+1\nn\nH\n6\u03b2q V\nH \u03c6\u0307 dt\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fwith2\n\u03b41q =\n\n1 h (V \u2032 )2 V \u2032\u2032 i q\n1 h V \u2032\u2032\u2032 V \u2032 (V \u2032\u2032 )2 5q V \u2032\u2032 (V \u2032 )2 q(q + 2) (V \u2032 )4 i\n\u2212\n,\n\u03b4\n+\n\u2212\n+\n.

A slow-roll parameter of \u01ebq1 \u2265 0 governs the equation of states p = \u03c9q \u03c1 with \u03c9q = \u22121 + 2\u01ebq1 /3q, which\nimplies that an accelerating expansion occurs only for \u01ebq1 < 1 (\u03c9q < \u22121 + 2/3q) [23].\n\u01ebq1 = 0 (\u03c9q = \u22121) corresponds to a de Sitter inflation. On the other hand, the end of\ninflation is determined by \u01ebq1 = 1 (\u03c9q = \u22121 + 2/3q). Hence the allowed regions for inflation are different: \u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 < \u22121/3 for GR models, \u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 < 0 for GB model, and\n\u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 < \u22122/3 for RS model. If one chooses the inflation potential V , then potential\nslow-roll parameters (\u01ebq1 , \u03b4nq ) will be determined explicitly.\nWe describe how inflation parameters can be calculated using the slow-roll formalism.\nIntroducing a variable uq = a(\u03b4\u03c6q \u2212 \u03c6\u0307\u03c8 q /H) where \u03b4\u03c6q is a perturbed inflaton and \u03c8 q is\na perturbed metric, its Fourier modes uqk in the perturbation theory satisfy the Mukhanov\nequation [24]:\n1 d2 zq\nd2 uqk\n2\n+\nk\n\u2212\nuqk = 0,\n2\n2\nd\u03c4\nzq d\u03c4\n!\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is a conformal time defined by d\u03c4 = dt/a, and zq = a\u03c6\u0307/H encodes all information\nabout a slow-roll inflation for a patch model with q.

INFLATION WITH POTENTIALS\n\nA generic single-field potential can be characterized by two energy scales: a height of\npotential V0 corresponding to the vacuum energy density during inflation and a width of\nthe potential \u03bc corresponding to the change of an inflaton \u2206\u03c6 during inflation. In general\nits form is given by V = V0 f (\u03c6/\u03bc). Different potentials have different f -forms. The height\nV0 is usually fixed by normalization and thus the free parameter is just the width \u03bc. We\nclassify potentials into three cases: large-field, small-field, hybrid potentials.\nA. Large-field potentials\n\nIt was shown that the quartic potential of V = V0 \u03c64 is under strong observation pressure\n(ruled out observationally) for GR and RS (GB) models, while the quadratic potential of\nV = V0 \u03c62 is inside of the 1\u03c3-bound for GR and GB models with the range of e-folding number\n50 \u2264 N \u2264 60. This is obtained from the likelihood analysis based on the leading-order\ncalculations to nqs and Rq with patch cosmological models [19]. Here we choose the largefield potentials of V LF = V0 \u03c6p with p = 2, 4, 6 for testing these with the patch cosmology.\nIn this case potential slow-roll parameters are determined by\nqp\n1\n,\n2 [(q \u2212 1)p + 2]N + qp\n2\n(2 \u2212 2p + qp)\n1\n.\n\u03b41q =\n2 [(q \u2212 1)p + 2]N + qp\n2\n\u01ebq1 =\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nSubstituting these into Eqs.(11) and (19), one finds two inflation parameters. For a full\ncomputation of inflation parameters, see Ref. [20]. The LF-spectral index is given by\nnLF\n=1\u2212\ns\n\n(3q \u2212 2)p + 2\n[(q \u2212 1)p + 2]N +\n\n(23)\n\nqp\n2\n\nin the leading-order calculation. The LF tensor-to-scalar ratio takes the form\nRqLF =\n\n8qp\n1\n\u03b6q [(q \u2212 1)p + 2]N +\n\nqp\n2\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nFortunately, there is no free parameter for large-field models. The numerical results [20,5]\nfor large-field potentials are shown in Table II.\nB. Small-field potentials\n\nIn this subsection we choose the small-field potentials of V SM = V0 [1 \u2212 (\u03c6/\u03bc)p] with\np = 2, 4, 6. Here \u03bc plays a role of the free parameter.

This\nmeans that the RS model is obtained from the RS braneworld in high-energy region, while\nthe GB model is mainly determined from the Gauss-Bonnet term in the braneworld.

Fortunately,\n|(\u03c6/\u03bc)|2 < 1 is required because if |(\u03c6/\u03bc)|2 > 1 in V HY , it is not much different from the\nlarge-field potentials. From Eq.(45), one finds a restrictive constraint |(\u03c6/\u03bc)|2 < 4q1 which\ncomes from the condition of nHY\n> 1.\ns\nIn order to see a feature of the hybrid models, we need numerical results.

DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe introduce various potentials which are classified into large-field, small-field, and hybrid types for the ordinary inflation in the GR case. Using the patch cosmological models\ntogether with various potentials, we compute the two cosmological observables, spectral\nindex and tensor-to-scalar ratio.\nIn large-field models without free parameter, the spectral index ns and tensor-to-scalar\nratio R depend on the e-folding number N only. Actually this simplicity provides strong\nconstraints on large-field models. Further, combining the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld with\nlarge-field potentials provides more tighten constraints than the 4D general relativistic case.\nThe GB case is regarded as the promising model for testing the large-field potentials because\nit accepts the quadratic potential. On the other hand, it rejects the quartic potential because\ntheoretical points are far outside the 2\u03c3-bound [19]. Actually, the GB cosmological model\nimproves the theoretical values predicted by the GR model, whereas the RS model provides\nindistinctive values more than the GR case. As is shown in Table II, the GB model splits\nlarge-field potentials into three distinct regions clearly: for N = 55, nGB\n= 0.97 \u2192 0.95 (p =\ns\n2 \u2192 p = 4), RGB = 0.14 \u2192 0.56, and a power-law inflation with p = 6: nPs I = 1 \u2212 [(2r \u2212\n1)/2r 4]1/3 , RP I = 16/r [18]. Contrastively, we have nGR\n= 0.96 \u2192 0.95 \u2192 0.93 (p = 2 \u2192\ns\np = 4 \u2192 p = 6), RGR = 0.14 \u2192 0.29 \u2192 0.43, whereas nRS\n= 0.96 \u2192 0.95 \u2192 0.94, RRS =\ns\n0.22 \u2192 0.29 \u2192 0.32. Theoretical points predicted by the RS model lie very close to the\nborder between the regions allowed and disallowed by observation. Consequently, the largefield models depend on critically which model is used for calculation.\nIn small-field potentials, one has a free parameter \u03bc (xqp ) related to the potential shape.\nIt is thus difficult to constrain inflation parameters, in compared to the large-field potentials.\nHowever, combining the graphical analysis with the data [10], we find useful bounds. For\nxqp \u226a 1, there is no constraint on the lower-bound for the spectral index, but all of its upper\nbounds are given by 1. This means that patch cosmological model is not useful for testing\n10\n\n\fsmall-field potentials. For xqp \u226b 1 and p > 2, one finds lower-bounds for the spectral indices.\nFurthermore there is no constraint on the spectral indices for p = 2 case. This implies\nthat although ns is independent of the patch parameter q, the small-field potentials are in\ngood agreement with the observational data [5,6]. Combining the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld\nwith small-field potentials, there exist unobserved differences in the upper-bound of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio R.\nConcerning the hybrid models, we find a blue spectral index with nSF\n> 1. However,\ns\nthere is no actual difference between patch cosmological model because one more free parameter is necessary to determine the end of inflation (\u03c6f ), in addition to \u03bc (xqp ). It implies that\nthe scheme of inflation (q) is less important than mechanism of the hybrid inflation (\u03bc, \u03c6f ).\nAs a result, we do not find any new result when combining the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld\nwith the hybrid potentials.\nIn conclusion, the GB model is still a promising one to discriminate between the quadratic\nand quartic potentials in the large-field type by making use of the observation data. Although\nthe small-field potential are insenstive to patch cosmological models, these are considered\nas the promising potentials in view of the observational data. Finally we do not find any\nnew result when combining the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld with the hybrid potentials. This\nimplies that it is not easy for hybrid type to compare with the data [5,6].\nAcknowledgements\n\nY.S. was supported in part by KOSEF, Project No. R02-2002-000-00028-0.
