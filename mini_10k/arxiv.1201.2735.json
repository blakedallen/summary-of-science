The nuclear transparency, the ratio of the produced \u03c10 's on a nucleus\nrelative to deuterium, which is sensitive to \u03c1A interaction, was studied as function of the coherence length (lc ), a\nlifetime of the hadronic fluctuation of the virtual photon, and the four-momentum transfer squared (Q2 ). While the\ntransparency for both 12 C and 56 Fe showed no lc dependence, a significant Q2 dependence was measured, which is\nconsistent with calculations that included the color transparency effects.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that\nhadrons produced in exclusive reactions with sufficiently high squared four momentum transfers (Q2 ) can\npass through nuclear matter with dramatically reduced\ninteractions [1, 2, 3]. This is the so-called color transparency (CT) phenomenon, a key property of QCD as\na color gauge theory. According to QCD, hard exclusive processes have the power to select special configurations of the hadron wave function where all quarks\nare close together, forming a color neutral small size\nconfiguration (SSC) with transverse size r\u22a5 \u223c 1/Q. In\nthese SSCs, the external color field vanishes as the distance between quarks shrinks and their color fields cancel each other, similar to the reduced electric field of a\nvery small electric dipole. The reduced color field of the\nSSC allows it to propagate through a nucleus with little\nattenuation [4, 5].\nNuclear transparency, defined as the ratio of nuclear\ncross section per nucleon to that on a free nucleon, is\nthe observable used to search for CT. The experimental signature of CT is the increase of the nuclear transparency, as Q2 increases due to decreased interaction of\nthe \u03c10 on its way out. In the absence of CT effects, the\nhadron-nucleon total cross-section, and thus the nuclear\ntransparency, are nearly energy-independent [6].\n\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n\n2\n\nObservation of CT requires that the SSC propagates a\nreasonable distance through the nucleus before expanding into a fully formed hadron. At very high energies,\nthis is easily achieved since the SSC is highly relativistic and its lifetime in the nucleus rest frame will be dilated [3, 7]. CT at high energy was observed by the\nE791 experiment [8] at Fermilab which studied the A\ndependence of coherent diffractive dissociation of 500\nGeV pions into di-jets on carbon and platinum targets.\nAs predicted [9, 10], the A-dependence of the measured\ncross sections was consistent with the nuclear target acting as a filter that removes all but small size configurations of the pion wave function. Due to the small transverse separation of the filtered qq\u0304 pair, the quark and\nanti-quark each form a jet of hadrons in the final state.\nAt low and intermediate energies, where the SSC travels a very short distance before evolving into a hadron,\nthe situation is more challenging. In this kinematical\nregion, the interaction of the hadron with the nucleus\ndepends on the momentum at which it is produced, the\nevolution time of the SSC, its interaction cross section\nas it evolves into a normal state, and the distance it must\ntravel through the nucleus.\nStudying CT at low energies provides valuable information on SSC formation, expansion and, most impor-\n\n\f51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n\ntantly, its interaction as a function of its color field. CT\nis a key property of QCD. It offers a unique probe of\n\"color\", a defining feature of QCD, yet totally invisible in the observed structure of ordinary nuclear matter. Establishing the kinematic conditions for the onset\nof CT is also critical to the future program of proton\nstructure studies based on deep exclusive meson processes where the CT property of QCD is routinely used\nin the proof of QCD factorization theorem [11]. Recently, CT was proposed [12] as the possible cause of\nthe anomalous increase with centrality in the ratio of\nprotons-to-pions produced at large transverse momenta\nin gold-gold collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider in Brookhaven National Lab [13].\nSearches for CT with proton knock-out have all been\nnegative [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] or inconclusive [19, 20, 21],\nwhile results for meson production [22, 23, 24, 25] have\nbeen more promising. The reason could be that the creation of a SSC is more probable for a meson than for\na baryon since only two quarks have to be localized to\nform the SSC. The first hint of CT at moderate energies was obtained in pion photoproduction off 4 He [22]\nwith photon energies up to 4.5 GeV, but the experiment\nneeded greater statistical precision to achieve conclusive findings. Another experiment [23] studied pion\nelectroproduction off 12 C, 27 Al, 64 Cu and 197 Au over a\nrange of Q2 = 1.1 - 4.7 GeV2 . The nuclear transparencies of all targets relative to deuterium showed an increase with increasing Q2 . The most statistically significant result corresponds to the nuclear transparency for\n197\nAu, which when fitted with a linear Q2 dependence\nresulted in a slope of 0.012 \u00b1 0.004 GeV\u22122 . The authors\nconcluded that measurements at still higher momentum\ntransfer would be needed to firmly establish the onset of\nCT.\nExclusive diffractive electroproduction of \u03c10 mesons\nprovides a tool of choice to study color transparency.\nThe advantage of using \u03c10 mesons is that they have the\nsame quantum numbers as photons and so can be produced by a simple diffractive interaction, which selects\nsmall size initial state [26]. In this process, illustrated in\nFig. 1, the incident electron exchanges a virtual photon with the nucleus. The photon can then fluctuate\ninto a virtual qq\u0304 pair [27] of small transverse separation [28] proportional to 1/Q, which can propagate over\na distance lc = 2\u03bd/(Q2 + Mq2q\u0304 ), known as the coherence\nlength, where \u03bd is the energy of the virtual photon and\nMqq\u0304 is the invariant mass of the qq\u0304 pair. The virtual qq\u0304\npair can then scatter diffractively off a bound nucleon\nand becomes an on mass shell SSC. While expanding in\nsize, the SSC travels through the nucleus and ultimately\nevolves to a fully formed \u03c10 , which, in the final state,\n\nlc\n\ne'\n\ne\n\n\u03b3*\n\nq\n\nq\u03bc=(q,\u03bd )\n\nq\n\nN\n\nSSC\n\n\u03c10\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0N'\n\nFigure 1: An illustration of the creation of a SSC and its evolution to\na fully formed \u03c10 (see the text for a full description).\n\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n\n3\n\ndecays into a (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) pair. By increasing Q2 , the size\nof the selected SSC can be reduced and consequently\nthe nuclear transparency for the \u03c10 should increase.\nThe nuclear transparency, T A , is taken to be the ratio of the observed \u03c10 mesons per nucleon produced\non a nucleus (A) relative to those produced from deuterium, where no significant absorption is expected. CT\nshould yield an increase of T A with Q2 , but measurements by the HERMES [29] collaboration show that T A\nalso varies with lc , which can also lead to a Q2 dependence. Thus, to unambiguously identify CT, lc should\nbe held constant or, alternatively, kept small compared\nto the nuclear radius to minimize the interactions of the\nqq\u0304 pair prior to the diffractive production of the SSC.\nFermilab experiment E665 [24] and the HERMES experiment [25] at DESY used exclusive diffractive \u03c10 leptoproduction to search for CT. However, both measurements lacked the necessary statistical precision. HERMES measured the Q2 dependence of the nuclear transparency for several fixed lc values. A simultaneous fit of\nthe Q2 dependence over all lc bins resulted in a slope of\n0.089 \u00b1 0.046 GeV\u22122 . The unique combination of high\nbeam intensities available at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility know as JLab and the wide\nkinematical coverage provided by the Hall B large acceptance spectrometer [30] (CLAS) was key to the success of the measurements reported here.\nThe experiment ran during the winter of 2004. An\nelectron beam with 5.014 GeV energy was incident simultaneously on a 2 cm liquid deuterium target and a 3\nmm diameter solid target (C or Fe). The nuclear targets\nwere chosen to optimize two competing requirements;\nprovide sufficient nuclear path length compared to the\nSSC expansion length while minimizing the probability\nof \u03c10 decay inside the nucleus. A new double-target system [31] was developed to reduce systematic uncertainties and allow high precision measurements of the transparency ratios between heavy targets and deuterium.\nThe cryogenic and solid targets were located 4 cm apart\n\n\f144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n\nto minimize the difference in CLAS acceptance while\nmaintaining the ability to identify the target where the\ninteraction took place event-by-event via vertex reconstruction. The thickness of the solid targets (1.72 mm\nfor carbon and 0.4 mm for iron) were chosen so that all\nof the targets including deuterium had comparable luminosities (\u223c 1034 nucleon cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). The scattered electrons and two oppositely charged pions were detected\nin coincidence using the CLAS spectrometer. The scattered electrons were identified using the \u010cerenkov and\nthe electromagnetic calorimeter while the pions were\nidentified through time-of flight measurements [30].\nThe \u03c10 mesons were identified through the reconstructed invariant mass of the two detected pions with\n0.6 < M\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 < 1 GeV. For each event, several kinematic\nvariables were evaluated including Q2 , lc using the \u03c10\nmass instead of Mqq\u0304 , the photon-nucleon invariant mass\nsquared W 2 , the squared four-momentum transfer to the\ntarget t, and the fraction of the virtual photon energy\ncarried by the \u03c10 meson z\u03c1 = E\u03c1 /\u03bd where E\u03c1 is the energy of the \u03c10 . To identify exclusive diffractive and incoherent \u03c10 events, a set of kinematic conditions had to\nbe satisfied. We required W > 2 GeV to suppress pions from decay of resonances, \u2212t < 0.4 GeV2 to select\ndiffractive events, \u2212t > 0.1 GeV2 to exclude coherent\nproduction off the nucleus and z\u03c1 > 0.9 to select elastically produced \u03c10 mesons. The two pions invariant\nmass distributions are shown in Fig. 2. After applying\nall the cuts, the invariant mass distribution (Fig2.b) exhibits a clean \u03c10 peak positioned around 770 MeV with\nthe expected width of 150 MeV. A good description of\nthe data was obtained using our Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Our generator simulates the \u03c10 electroproduction process and the main channels that may produce\na (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) pair in the final state and contribute to the\nbackground underneath the \u03c10 peak. These channels\nare ep \u2192 e\u2206++ \u03c0\u2212 , ep \u2192 e\u22060 \u03c0+ and a non resonant\nep \u2192 ep\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 . The cross sections of these processes\nwere taken from existing measurements [32]. The standard CLAS GEANT based simulation packages was\nused to simulate the experimental apparatus. The Fermi\nmotion of the nucleons in nuclei was simulated by folding the elementary cross section with the spectral function of the target using a realistic model [33]. Radiative\neffects are also included in the simulation.\nThe nuclear transparency for a given target, with nucleon number A, is defined as\n\u03c1\nint\n(1)\nT A = (NA\u03c1 /Lint\nA )/(ND /LD ),\n\nCounts\n\n142\n143\n\n189\n\n191\n\nwhere D refers to deuterium, and A to carbon or iron,\n\u03c1\nLint\nA,D to the integrated luminosities and NA,D to the\n0\nnumber of incoherent \u03c1 events per nucleon after\n\n60000\n40000\n20000\n0\n\n(b)\n\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n800\n\n(c)\n\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n(d)\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nM\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212(GeV)\nFigure 2: (color online) The (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) invariant mass histogram for\niron.

The magnitudes of each contributing\nprocess were taken as free parameters in the fit of\nthe mass spectra. The acceptance correction to the\ntransparency ratio was found to vary between 5 and\n30%. Radiative corrections were extracted for each\n(lc , Q2 ) bin using our MC generator in conjunction\nwith the DIFFRAD [34] code developed for exclusive\nvector meson production. The radiative correction to\nthe transparency ratio was found to vary between 0.4\nand 4%. An additional correction of around 2.5% was\napplied to account for the contribution of deuterium\ntarget endcaps. The corrected t distributions for exclusive events were fit with an exponential form Ae\u2212bt . The\nslope parameters b for 2 H (3.59 \u00b1 0.5), C (3.67 \u00b1 0.8)\nand Fe (3.72 \u00b1 0.6) were reasonably consistent with\nCLAS [35] hydrogen measurements of 2.63 \u00b1 0.44\ntaken with 5.75 GeV beam energy.\nThe transparencies for C and Fe are shown as a\nfunction of lc in Fig. 3. As expected, they do not exhibit\nany lc dependence because lc is much shorter than the\nC and Fe nuclear radii of 2.7 and 4.6 fm respectively.\nConsequently, the coherence length effect cannot mimic\nthe CT signal in this experiment.\nFig. 4 shows the increase of the transparency with\nQ2 for both C and Fe. The data are consistent with\nexpectations of CT. Note that in the absence of CT\neffects, hadronic Glauber calculations would predict\nno Q2 dependence of T A since any Q2 dependence in\nthe \u03c10 production cross section would cancel in the\nratio. The rise in transparency with Q2 corresponds\n\nFigure 4: (color online) Nuclear transparency as a function of Q2 .\nThe inner error bars are statistic uncertainties and the outer ones are\nstatistic and point-to-point (Q2 dependent) systematic uncertainties\nadded in quadrature.

The fact that we were\nable to observe the increase in nuclear transparency\nrequires that the SSC propagated sufficiently far in the\nnuclear medium and experienced reduced interaction\nwith the nucleons before evolving to a normal hadron.\nThe Q2 dependence of the transparency was fitted by\na linear form T A = a Q2 + b.

While the KNS and GKM\nmodels yield an approximately linear Q2 dependence,\nthe FMS calculation yields a more complicated Q2\ndependence as shown in Fig. 4. The measured slope\nfor carbon corresponds to a drop in the absorption of\nthe \u03c10 from 37% at Q2 = 1 GeV2 to 32% at Q2 = 2.2\nGeV2 , in reasonable agreement with the calculations.\nDespite the differences between these models in the\nassumed production mechanisms and SSC interaction\nin the nuclear medium, they all support the idea that\nthe observed Q2 dependence is clear evidence for the\nonset of CT, demonstrating the creation of small size\nconfigurations, their relatively slow expansion and their\nreduced interaction with the nuclear medium.\nThe onset of CT in \u03c10 electroproduction seems to\noccur at lower Q2 than in the pion measurements. This\nearly onset suggests that diffractive meson production\nis the optimal way to create a SSC [26]. The Q2\ndependence of the transparency ratio is mainly sensitive\nto the reduced interaction of the SSC as it evolves\ninto a full-sized hadron, and thus depends strongly on\nthe expansion length over which the SSC color fields\nexpand to form a \u03c10 meson. The expansion length\nused by the FMS and GKM models is between 1.1 and\n2.4 fm for \u03c10 mesons produced with momenta from 2\nto 4.3 GeV while the KNS model uses an expansion\nlength roughly a factor of two smaller. The agreement\nbetween the observed Q2 dependence and these models\nsuggests that these assumed expansion distances are\nreasonable, yielding rest-frame SSC lifetimes of about\n0.5 \u2212 1 \u00d7 10\u221224 second.\nIn summary, we have experimentally observed the\nformation of small size configurations in diffractive \u03c10\nmeson electroproduction and its reduced interaction as\nit travels through the nucleus. Our data are consistent\nwith expectations of color transparency and, based on\nthe existing models, provide the first estimate of the expansion time (lifetime) for these exotic configurations.\nHaving established these features, detailed studies of\nthe theoretical models will allow the first quantitative\nevaluation of the structure and evolution properties\n\nof the SSCs. Such studies will be further enhanced\nby future measurements [40], which will include\nadditional nuclei and extend to higher Q2 values.\n\n313\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n323\n324\n325\n\n328\n329\n330\n331\n332\n333\n334\n335\n336\n337\n338\n339\n340\n341\n342\n343\n344\n345\n346\n347\n348\n349\n350\n351\n352\n353\n354\n355\n356\n357\n358\n\n6\n\n[1] G.
