Scaling in the fluctuations occurs\nwhen the dispersion of a quantity at each node or edge increases like\nthe its mean to the power \u03bc.

Within our model the absence of any preference leads\nto the absence of scaling, and when scaling occurs it is non-universal;\nfor random diffusion the number of packets passing a node scales with\nan exponent \u03bc which increases continuously with increased acquisition time window from \u03bc = 1/2 at small windows, to \u03bc = 1 at long\ntime windows; In the preferentially navigated diffusive motion, busy\nnodes and edges have exponent \u03bc = 1, in contrast to less busy parts\nof the network, where an exponent \u03bc = 1/2 is found. Broad distributions of the return times at nodes and edges illustrate that the basis\nof the observed scaling is the cooperative behaviour between groups\nof nodes or edges. These conclusions are relevant for a large class of\ndiffusive dynamics on networks, including packet transport with local\nnavigation rules.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn transport processes on networks complex dynamical behaviour may be\ncaused by the structure of underlying network geometry (for a recent review see [1] and references therein). The inhomogeneous degree distributions\nfound in the scale-free networks may be one cause of this behaviour, however, other structural details appear to be essential when dynamics include\nthe local navigation of packets [1, 2, 3]. Queuing effects at nodes, which is\nessential for high density information packet transport [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and\nis usually absent in other transport processes such as charge transport [7], is\nanother cause of collective behaviour in transport dynamics.\nMany dynamically measurable outputs exhibit scaling features, indicating a degree of universality that, in turn, can be used to probe a network's\nstructural and traffic properties [1]. Distributions of transport times, waiting\ntimes and noise fluctuations exhibit power-law behaviour in different network\nmodels. However, it is not an easy task to relate the emergent dynamical\nfeatures to particular structural properties, firstly because of the network's\npower-law inhomogeneity but also because different structural elements, i.e.,\nnodes or edges, or higher (hidden) structures, may play a role in the dynamics. Therefore, a more systematic study of traffic scaling properties, that\nconsiders structure beyond the node's connectivity, is necessary in order to\nreveal the origin of scaling and relate the observed scaling properties to the\nspecific structural and dynamical features on complex networks.\nIn view of the long-range correlations in packet streams on inhomogeneous\nnetworks, analysis of traffic noise, defined by the number of packets processed\nby a node, and traffic flow, the number of packets passing along an edge,\ncan give interesting information about traffic conditions and the underlying\nnetwork structure [1]. In recent studies a multi-channel analysis of traffic\nnoise on networks [8, 9, 10] reveals that the set of fluctuations {\u03c3i } of the\ntraffic time-series {hi (t)} measured at all nodes in the network i = 1, 2, * * * N\nobeys the scaling law\n\u03c3i \u223c< hi >\u03bc .\n(1)\nThe exponent \u03bc is often found to be either \u03bc = 1/2 or \u03bc = 1, suggesting a\nsuper-universal behaviour across different networks [8]. However, recently it\nwas found [9, 10, 1] that the exponent \u03bc may depend on traffic conditions\nand the type of measurements taken. Similar results, in which non-universal\nscaling was found to depend on the acquisition time window, where found\nin the analysis of stock market time series [11]. A unique exponent between\nthese two universal values was also found in the analysis of the genome-wide\ntime series of the gene expression of yeast [12], the dynamics of which is\n2\n\n\fnaturally limited by the cell cycle.\nIn this paper we address the question of scaling in the diffusive dynamics\non networks, by carefully selecting the inhomogeneity of the network and\nthe dynamical rule, in order to determine the origin of the scaling and its\nrobustness. To demonstrate the importance of these dynamic phenomena\nin real-world networks, we employ a non-trivial model for the transport of\ninformation packets [13, 2, 3, 1]. For the purpose of this work we use a\nsimple scale-free network [14, 15] with a clear inhomogeneity in the node\nconnectivity but with low clustering and no edge correlations. We consider\ntwo types of diffusive motion of the packets on the graph: random diffusion\nand local navigation with preferred edges, as described below.\nIn comparison to the models considered in [8, 9], our traffic model is more\nrealistic in that:\n\u2022 Packets are created at a given rate R and travel to specified destinations\non network;\n\u2022 Packets queue dynamically at nodes;\n\u2022 Packets are navigated locally according to a specified algorithm.\nConsequently the travel-times are determined self-consistently rather than\nbeing fixed as an adjustable external parameter of the model and have a\nbroad distribution with a power-law tail, which depends on the network\nstructure navigation algorithms [2, 16]. The waiting times of packets in\nqueues is another property of our model that is determined self-consistently\nby the dynamics. Depending on the type of queuing discipline employed, the\nwaiting time distribution can also have a power-law tail on scale-free networks\n[2]. Throughout this work we use low packet densities in order to keep the\ntime series of traffic noise and flow stationary and avoid the effect of large\nqueuing times (see [1] for a study of dense traffic on structured networks).\nOur main findings suggest that the presence of a preference in either the\ntopology, such as in node connectivity, or in the dynamics, such as by edgepreferred navigation, leads to the scaling of fluctuations. When this scaling\noccurs, careful analysis shows that it is non-universal, depending both on the\nacquisition-time and on the importance of the nodes or edges in the transport\nprocess. These findings of collective dynamical behavior on networks are\nfurther substantiated with a study of the return-times statistics for nodes\nand edges.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we define the network and the traffic model and summarize the main features of the transport\nprocess. In section 3 the results for noise and flow fluctuations are given for\n3\n\n\fvarious parameters and dynamic rules and in section 4 the origins of scaling\nare discussed and compared with transport on much simpler geometries. In\nsection 5 the results for the return-times distributions are obtained for the\nnetwork dynamics studied in section 3, and section 6 gives a short summary\nand discussion of our results.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTraffic of information packets with queuing\nand navigation on network\nNetwork structure\n\nWe consider a simple scale-free network [14, 15] with a power-law inhomogeneity in node connectivity, low clustering and no correlations between\nedges. Such a network can be easily grown with a preferential attachment\nrule in which a node with two links is added to the network at each time\nstep and each link is connected to a node of degree k with a rate proportional to k + \u03b1. In the emergent structure the degree of the ith added node\nki \u223c (i/N)\u22121/(1+\u03b1) , and hence the connectivity distribution has a power-law\ntail, P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03c4 with \u03c4 = 2 + \u03b1, as shown analytically [15]. A detailed\nanalysis of the structure of the networks grown in this way shows that the\nclustering is very low and link correlations are entirely absent, in contrast to\ncorrelated scale-free networks, grown with the algorithms described in [17].\nFor our simulations of packet diffusion we grow a simple uncorrelated scalefree network of N = 1002 nodes and E = 2N edges, which has a connectivity\ndistribution with a power-law exponent \u03c4 \u2248 2.5.\nOnce the network is generated, we consider it's structure as fixed, and\nstart the transport processes on it. During these dynamics, at each time step\neach node can create a new packet with probability R/N. At creation each\npacket is assigned a destination address, another node on the network where\nit should be delivered. Packets move diffusively through the network, either\nperforming a random walk or navigated according to the algorithm described\nbelow. Once at the destination address packets disappear from the network.\nIn this model packets move towards their destination simultaneously, forming\nqueues at the nodes on the way. We assume a finite queue buffer of length\nH = 1000 at each node. The first in - first out (FIFO) queuing discipline is\napplied. The maximum length of the queue is important for transport close\nto the congestion state and has an impact on the scaling of the fluctuations\non nodes [1, 10].\n\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nRandom diffusion and edge-preferred navigation\n\nThe motion of packets through the network can either be random or navigated using some rules, which may affect the role of different nodes and\nedges in the transport process. In the case of random diffusion (RD) a node\nthat is processing a packet selects one of its neighbouring nodes at random\nto send the packet to it. Hence the nodes on the network are visited at a\nrate proportional of their connectivity, and hence nodes with a high connectivity are often visited by moving packets. Implementation of a navigation\nalgorithm [18, 1] will create a bias in the use of nodes and edges on a given\ntopology. Here we consider one such navigation algorithm, referred to as the\nCD algorithm, that introduces a preference for less used edges in the traffic\nhistory [18]. In particular, a node i that is processing a packet at time step\nt selects one of its neighbour nodes, j, that has the minimum value of the\nquantity sij (t) defined as the product\nsij (t) = kj Fij (t) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere kj is the degree of the node j and Fij (t) is the number of packets forwarded from node i \u2192 j up to the time t. This means that the CD algorithm\nis completely deterministic, involves a search of the nearest neighbourhood\nof the processing node, prefers to send packet to nodes away from the hubs\nand hence introduces a dynamical inhomogeneity to the network transport.\nIn this way, from the point of view of nodes, the topological inhomogeneity\nof the network appears to be dynamically reduced. At the same time, an\nunequal use of edges appears, that is measured by the packet flow on them.\nNote that this property of the navigation rules may reduce jamming problems\nat high traffic density, which often occur on scale-free networks in algorithms\nbased on the shortest paths [18]. We consider low packet density by keeping a\nlow posting rate R, which is much below the jamming rate for this network's\nstructure and navigation rules, in order to minimize the potential effects of\nlong queues and to retain the stationarity of the traffic time series.\n\n2.3\n\nTraffic properties\n\nFor the fixed network topology described above and a fixed posting rate of\npackets R, we simulate packet transport both with random diffusion rules and\nwith the CD navigation algorithm. The transport properties are measured\nby a number of global and local statistical quantities [13, 2, 3, 1], which\ndepend on the diffusion rules. Here we summarize several traffic properties\nwhich are relevant for further discussion. In Fig. 1 we show how the two\ndiffusion rules effect the distributions of travel times of packets and flow\n5\n\n\falong the edges on the scale-free network. Both in the random diffusion and\nin the navigated transport the distribution of travel times exhibits a powerlaw tail, however, both slopes and cut-offs are different. The distribution of\ndynamic flow along edges of the network is shown in Fig. 1b. For RD the\ndynamical flow is similar to the topological flow (the centrality measure of\nedges) and is dominated by an average value with a width which depends\non the packet density. In contrast, the CD navigation algorithm induces a\nnon-symmetric flow distribution created by the dynamically preferred edges.\nFurther differences in traffic with the two diffusion rules are shown in\nthe time series of the number of packets processed by individual nodes and\nedges, shown in Fig. 2. A detailed analysis of such time series is given in the\nfollowing section.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: (a) Distribution of travel times of packets and (b) distribution\nof flow along the edges for both random diffusion (RD) and edge-preferred\nnavigation (CD).\n\n3\n\nScaling of Noise and Flow\n\nNoise and flow are two local characteristics of the traffic that are determined\nby the number of packets transported in a given time window tk at a node i\nhi (tk ), and along a link i \u2192 j and j \u2192 i, fij (tk ). The index k = 1, 2 * * * Kmax\nenumerates time windows of length TW IN time steps.\nThe flow fij (tk ) can be written as\nfij (tk ) = Fij (tk ) + Fji (tk ) \u2212 [Fij (tk\u22121 ) + Fji (tk\u22121 )]\n6\n\n(3)\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: Example of time series recorded at (a) a preferred node and (b) at\nan edge with random diffusion rules and time-window TW IN = 1000 steps.\nwhere tk = kTW IN . During the transport process we record a set of fluctuating time-series, one for each of N nodes {hi (tk )}, i = 1, 2, * * * N, and similarly\nanother set of time-series collected for each of the 2N edges {fij (tk )} on the\nnetwork. In the simulations we fix the creation rates of packets at R = 0.01\nfor the RD and R = 0.1 for CD-navigated diffusion, which are well below the\nrespective jamming rates on this network structure.\n\n3.1\n\nNoise fluctuations at nodes with scale-free connectivity\n\nWe determine the dispersion \u03c3i and an average < hi > of long time series\nrecorded at all nodes {hi (tk )}, i = 1, 2, * * * N and k = 1, 2, * * * Kmax . Plots\nof \u03c3i against < hi > are given in Fig. 3a, where each point represents one\nnode of our scale-free network. The two curves correspond to the results for\nRD dynamics and for the transport with the CD navigation algorithm and\na fixed acquisition time window TW IN = 4000 time steps. As the Fig. 3a\nshows, these plots obey the scaling equation (1) with a well defined exponent\n\u03bc, which is different for the two algorithms. For RD the value of \u03bc is clearly\nbetween the two limits 1/2 and 1 mentioned above, whereas in the case of\nthe CD navigation algorithm \u03bc appears to be close to 1.\nBy changing the width of the time window in which the data is collected\nwe find that the scaling law still holds, but with a different exponent \u03bc. This\napplies for both RD and CD, however, the functional dependencies \u03bc(TW IN )\nare different. The results are shown in Fig. 3b. As a rule, if data are acquired\nin a longer time window, the exponent \u03bc tends to be larger. For RD we find\n7\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: (a) Dispersion \u03c3i against average < hi > of time series recorded\nat nodes of the network within a fixed time window TW IN for random (RD)\nand navigated (CD) diffusion. (b) Dependence of the scaling exponent \u03bc on\nthe width of the time window. Slope of the line is \u03b2 = 0.11.\nthe change from weak dependence at short time windows to steeper increase\nwhen large windows are applied. For CD the exponent is constantly large for\nlarge time windows, and changes rapidly when the windows are smaller than\nthe typical TW IN \u2248 500 time steps in these simulations. In fact, for CD we\nfind that the dispersion between the groups of nodes exhibiting the scaling\nwith large \u03bc exponent is gradually reduced with decreasing time window\nand eventually the group becomes so condensed that an exponent cannot be\ndefined. Simultaneously another group emerges with the scaling exponent\nclose to \u03bc = 1/2.\n\n3.2\n\nScaling of flow at preferred edges\n\nWe apply a similar multi-channel analysis to the data on traffic flow fluctuations. The flow along an edge between nodes i and j is the sum of flow from\ni \u2192 j and from j \u2192 i. In Fig. 4 we plot the standard deviations of the flow\ntime series \u03c3ij against the average flow along that edge < fij >. Each point\non the plot represents one edge on the network. As the Fig. 4a shows, in the\ncase of CD navigated diffusion, flow fluctuations obtained at a large number\nof edges follow the same scaling pattern as that described in Eq. (1) for noise\nfluctuations at nodes. However, in the case of edges, the situation becomes\ndifferent when random diffusion is used: the edges form a dense group on the\nplot, representing almost equal fluctuation properties. This implies that the\ndynamical preference in edges, which is built into the CD navigation rules,\n8\n\n\fintroduces both an uneven flow along different links and a different fluctuation pattern of the flow. The exponent that is measured from the data in\nFig. 4a is close to \u03bc = 1. In the same plot we find another group of edges for\nwhich the scaling exponent cannot be defined. When the width of the time\nwindow is reduced the fraction of edges that belongs to the scaling regime\nwith \u03bc \u2248 1 is reduced, and a number of edges appear in a new group, for\nwhich the scaling exponent is close to \u03bc \u2248 0.5. The transition between these\ntwo groups is quite sharp for the deterministic CD navigation (see Fig. 4b).\nWe investigate this question further by considering a simplified, probabilistic\nversion of the edge-preferred navigation, called D algorithm [18], in which a\npacket moves from node i to its neighbour j with probability\npij = 1 \u2212\n\nkj\nN\nX\n\n(4)\n\nCij kj\n\nj=1\n\nwhere Cij is the adjacency matrix and as before kj is the degree of node\nj. Hence packets are more likely to move towards neighbours with a low\nconnectivity. With this navigation rule, we find the flow fluctuations, shown\nin Fig. 5, exhibiting two distinct groups of edges with a smooth transition.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: (a) Dispersion \u03c3ij against average < fij > of time series recorded\nat edges of the network within a fixed time window TW IN = 4000 steps\nfor random diffusion RD and CD navigation rules. (b) Same as (a) but for\ndifferent time windows and CD navigation rule.\nStudy of the flow fluctuations suggests that the dynamical preference of\nedges, as in our navigation rules, introduces the necessary distinction between edges that leads to the scaling behaviour. In contrast to the noise\n9\n\n\fFigure 5: The flow fluctuations \u03c3ij against average flow < fij > for navigated\ndiffusion with probabilistic preference for edges pointing to low-connectivity\nnodes.\n\nfluctuations studied above, in flow fluctuations we did not observe a unique\nscaling exponent with a smooth dependence of the acquisition time window.\nAccording to their flow fluctuations, all edges appear to be in one of the\ntwo groups of well defined scaling exponents, either 1/2 or 1. The relative\npopulation of the groups changes, where the size of the group with the larger\nexponent is increasing with the length of the time window.\n\n4\n\nOrigin of Noise Scaling on Complex Networks\n\nIn the previous section a comparative analysis of the fluctuations of noise and\nflow suggested that in the diffusion processes a preference between network\nelements, that can be achieved in an inhomogeneous network, is necessary for\nthe scaling of the type in Eq. 1 to occur. In order to further clarify this point,\nwe have analysed different geometries including regular and homogeneous\nsubstrates.\nIn Fig. 6a and b we show the fluctuations of packets in random diffusion\nrecorded on nodes and edges of a square lattice and of a random graph.\nClearly, fluctuations of flow at edges on these structures appear to belong\nto one group within a statistical dispersion. However, the record of noise at\ndifferent nodes already shows grouping according to their connectivity: on\nthe square lattice one can distinguish between fluctuations in the number\nof packets processed by the four corner nodes, by nodes at the boundaries\nand by the rest of the nodes, whose the connectivity is four. A larger range\n10\n\n\fof groups of nodes is found on a random graph, with connectivities ranging\nfrom 2 to 8 edges per node, where the larger connectivity nodes are shifted\nto the right part of the plot. In the same spirit, on the scale-free network\nthe span of different groups of nodes, with different connectivities is even\nlarger, also visible in Fig. 3a, and it is related to the connectivity profile.\nTherefore, the direct relationship between the node connectivity and the\nnumber of processed packets by that node (its dynamic centrality) occurs\nin the random diffusion. This represents the basis of the observed scaling\nof noise fluctuations on the scale-free networks. In Fig. 6c we show the\nemergent linear dependence between the average noise at a node < hi > and\nits connectivity ki for our scale-free network, which applies for the case of the\nrandom diffusion algorithm (see also [19]). However, when the diffusion rules\nare changed, as in our navigated diffusion, for example, these relationships\nare altered. We find that in the case of CD navigation the average number\nof packets at nodes of large connectivity plateaus according to the functional\nform < hi >= a \u2212 bcki , with c = 0.6.\nHence, nodes with different connectivity play a different role in the diffusion processes on networks. This idea of dissimilarity can be extended to\nthe edges of the network when diffusion rules, such as our CD navigation,\nare implemented. Again, we observe distinct groups of edges which have different flow fluctuations, with more 'important' groups having proportionally\nlarger flow and large fluctuations.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6: For random diffusion, the dispersion against average of time series\nrecorded at nodes and links on (a) regular square lattice and (b) random\ngraph. In both figures, the most left group of points represents the data\ncollected at (edges links), while the remaining groups are for nodes. (c)\nThe average number of packets processed by a node against node degree for\nrandom (RD) and navigated (CD) diffusion.\nIt is an intrinsic property of the diffusive dynamics that different groups\nof nodes or edges develop a cooperative behavior and fall on a line with a well\n11\n\n\fdefined profile, as given in Eq. (1). Our results for the diffusive dynamics of\ninformation packets suggest that stationarity of the time series is a necessary\ncondition for such cooperativity to occur, whereas the dynamic continuity\nneed not be strictly observed (in our model sources and sinks of packets occur,\nwhich are balanced in the average). Our results show that in topologically\nor dynamically inhomogeneous systems nodes or edges may develop different\nlevels of cooperative behavior that leads to non-universal scaling. The nonuniversality is represented by the fact that the scaling exponent depends\non the dynamics, with either a continuous change between the two limiting\nvalues 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1, or with two exponents defined for different groups of\nedges. A possible origin of these two limiting values of the scaling exponent\nhas been discussed in [8, 9, 11].\n\n5\n\nReturn-Times to Nodes and Edges\n\nAnother type of dynamic measure collected at individual nodes and edges,\nthat depends on the dynamic behaviour of the whole network, is the statistics\nof return-times, or time intervals between the successive events at a given\nnode or an edge. In collective dynamical systems such as earthquakes [20, 21,\n22], critical sandpiles [23, 24], and stock market dynamics [25, 26], a broad\ndistribution of return times (sometimes called waiting times or recurrent\ntimes) is always found, with power-law tails suggesting the occurrence of\nlong-range dynamic correlations between the events. In this work we address\nthe question of return times to nodes and to edges in order to investigate\nfurther the nature of collective dynamic behaviour in our model of diffusion\nof packets on a scale-free network.\nReturn-Time to Nodes. In the case of random diffusion (random walks) on\nnetworks the return time distribution has been studied in other parts of the\ntheoretical physics literature. In particular, the first return time to the origin\nof a random walker on sparse random graphs, with nodes representing states\nof a system, was considered by Bray and Rodgers [27] as a model of nonexponential relaxation in spin glasses and other non-ergodic systems. With\nthe help of some heuristic arguments, they arrived at the conclusion that on\na random graph the long-time behaviour in the diffusion in the phase space is\ndominated by the parts of the network with linear chains (no loops), leading\nto the expression P (\u2206t) \u223c exp(\u2212A(p)(\u2206t)1/3 ), where p is the homogeneous\nconnectivity of the random graph and A(p) is known.\nThese arguments can be generalized to introduce a power-law distribution\nof connectivities. If the distribution of p behaves like \u223c p\u2212\u03c4 , and using the\nresult in [27] that as p \u2192 0, P (\u2206t) \u223c p exp(\u22122\u2206t/p), then integrating over\n12\n\n\fp leads to P (\u2206t) \u223c (\u2206t)\u2212\u03c4\u2206 with\n\u03c4\u2206 = \u03c4 \u2212 2 .\n\n(5)\n\nThus, the inhomogeneous connectivity creates a power-law distribution in\nthe return times distribution for RD. Recently a more rigorous treatment of\nrandom walks on scale-free networks was carried out by Noh and Rieger [19],\nthat yielded identical results. The results of our simulations for different\ndiffusion processes are shown in Fig. 7a. The return-time distributions in\ndifferent cases studied here seem to have a power-law behaviour before a\ncut-off. (The cut-off can be related to the network size in the case of single\nrandom walker. Note also a characteristic splitting at small \u2206T with an\ninherent preference for even return times, caused by the lack of clustering\nand the low density of walkers.) In the case of non-interacting random walks,\ni.e., random diffusion without queuing, the results agree, within error bars,\nwith the above theoretical prediction. We have the exponent \u03c4\u2206 = 0.56 \u00b1\n0.03, whereas the distribution of the network's connectivity has a power-law\nexponent \u03c4 \u2248 2.5 (see Sec. 2).\nIncreasing the traffic density reduces the value of the cut-off, but the\nslope remains practically unchanged. However, when the navigated diffusion\nis considered, both the slope and the cut-off of the distribution are changed.\nIn Fig. 7b we show the results for navigated diffusion with the CD algorithm,\nrandom diffusion with one-depth layer search and RD at low packet density.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: The all-return time distribution to nodes in the scale-free network for non-interacting and interacting walks with (a) the random diffusion\nalgorithm and (b) for interacting walks with different navigation algorithms.\nReturn-Time to Edges. In contrast with the return times to nodes, the\n13\n\n\fsituation is entirely different from the point of view of edges on the same\nnetwork. The results are shown in Fig. 8. We find a pronounced difference\nbetween the random and navigated diffusion in the tails of the distributions. In both cases, however, a unique functional form can be found. For\nlarger \u2206T the distributions of the return times to edges can be fitted with\na q\u2212exponential form, which is often related to non-ergodic behaviour in\ndynamical systems [28] :\n\u0012\n\u00131/(1\u2212q)\n\u2206t\nP (\u2206t) = B 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\n.\n\u2206t0\n\n(6)\n\nIn the case of random diffusion, shown in Fig. 8a, the distribution is very\nclose to the exponential form, which corresponds to the q \u2192 1 limit of Eq.\n(6). In fact, we find q = 1.08 in the case of random diffusion, whereas in the\ncase of edge-preferred CD navigation q = 1.33, compatible with non-ergodic\ndynamic behaviour.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8: The all-return time distribution to edges for (a) the random diffusion and (b) CD-navigated diffusion algorithms. The fit lines are explained\nin the text.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and Discussion\n\nWe have performed an analysis of the diffusive dynamics on a scale free\nnetwork with a power-law connectivity distribution but without any other\nform of structural inhomogeneity. Using the transport of information packets, where the diffusion rules can be modified in various ways by adjusting\n14\n\n\fthe navigation of packets at nodes, we were able to show that several dynamical effects appear to be related to the the microscopic diffusion rules.\nOur approach indicates that these findings will be relevant to more realistic transport problems on networks, which are very different from simple\nrandom-walks.\nIn particular, we pinpointed the importance of not just topological but\nalso dynamic preference to the occurrence of dynamic scaling. We implemented navigation rules that involve preferences between links, which\nis possible on topologically inhomogeneous scale-free networks. The edgepreferential navigation rules appear to dynamically homogenize the network\n(at large connectivity nodes) and yield new dynamical phenomena. We focused on two types of scaling behaviour that can be obtained from the point\nof view of individual structural elements, nodes and edges of the network,\nand are potentially related to each other: Scaling of noise and flow fluctuations, on one hand, and scaling of return-time distributions, on the other.\nWhile the noise fluctuations and/or return times at nodes have been studied\nextensively on different types of networks [8, 9, 10, 1], our work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the fluctuations of flow on edges and return times\nto edges, and a comparison with the quantities obtained at nodes within the\nsame dynamics. Owing to the different roles that nodes and edges play in\nthese diffusion processes on an inhomogeneous network, these comparative\nstudies lead to the conclusion that certain types of preferential behaviour in\neither nodes or edges is necessary for the occurrence of scaling. The scaling\nis characterized by the exponents \u03bc and \u03c4\u2206 and the parameter q.\nIn particular, no scaling behavior was found in the fluctuations of flow and\nin the return times to edges for random diffusion. On the other hand, when\nedge-preferred navigation is turned on, both a non-trivial scaling of the flow\nfluctuations and a power-law tail in the return-times to edges is observed.\nThe differences in node connectivities, studied in regular, random graph, and\nthe scale-free structures, leads to differences in the noise fluctuations both\nin random diffusion and in CD navigated diffusion. Accordingly, we find\nnon-trivial distributions of the return times to nodes, that are power-law (up\nto a finite-size cut-off), in agreement with theoretical predictions [27, 19].\nThe exponents, however, depend on the navigation rules. Only in the case of\nrandom diffusion do the return times scale with a power which is determined\nby the network's connectivity distribution.\nFurthermore, we show that the scaling properties of noise fluctuations\nare non-universal, with both the topological inhomogeneity but also details\nof the dynamics playing a role in the emergent scaling behaviour. In addition\nto a well pronounced dependence on the width of the time window, that was\nalso observed in other studies [9, 10, 1, 11], we found that navigation rules\n15\n\n\feffect the universality of noise fluctuations. Again, we found a qualitative\ndifference between the scaling properties at nodes and at edges. A unique\nscaling exponent \u03bc(TW IN ) is always found in case of noise fluctuations at\nnodes, whereas in our navigated diffusion the flow fluctuations at edges are\nbi-universal.\nFinally, we have demonstrated that by looking beyond the random walk\ndynamics on sparse topologies, one may find a number of new dynamical\nphenomena, that are both interesting from the point of theory, but also\npractically important for many real transport processes on networks.\nAcknowledgments: We acknowledge support from Programme P1-0044\nof the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology of the Republic\nof Slovenia, the British Council Partnerships in Science Project 22/2006 and\nthe EC Marie Curie Early Stage Training Programme NET-ACE (MESTCT-2004-6724).\n\nReferences\n[1] B.
