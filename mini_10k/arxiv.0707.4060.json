The characterization of the gaseous component, which initially\n1\n\nLaboratoire AIM, CEA/DSM - CNRS - Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, DAPNIA/Service d'Astrophysique,\nBat.\n709, CEA/Saclay, 91191 Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France, claire.martin-zaidi@cea.fr, pierreolivier.lagage@cea.fr, epantin@cea.fr\n2\n\nInstitut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, 91405 Orsay, France, emilie.habart@ias.u-psud.fr\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nrepresents 99% of the total disk mass, is a key research question towards an understanding\nof protoplanetary disks and planet formation. However, from previous observations, little is\nknown about the gas compared to the dust. Major questions concerning planet formation\nremain. How massive are the disks? Can giant planets form in every disk? How long does\nthe planet formation process take? Detailed information is required about the gas in disks\nin order to address these questions. In particular, characterizing the warm gas phase in the\ninner disk (R<50 AU), where planet formation is supposed to take place, is an essential step.\nMolecular hydrogen (H2 ) is the main constituent of the molecular cloud from which the\nyoung star is formed and is also expected to be the main component of the CS disk. It\nis expected to be at least 104 times more abundant than other gas tracers such as carbon\nmonoxide (CO) (e.g. Bell et al. 2006), since it self-shields very efficiently against photodissociation by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons and does not freeze effectively onto grain surfaces.\nH2 is the only molecule that can directly constrain the mass reservoir of warm and hot molecular gas in disks. Indeed, the detection of H2 excited by collisions allows us to measure the\ntemperature and density of the warm gas. Unfortunately, direct observation of H2 is difficult.\nElectronic transitions occur in the ultraviolet to which the Earth's atmosphere is opaque,\nand rotational and ro-vibrational transitions at infrared (IR) wavelengths are faint because of\ntheir quadrupolar origin. FUV absorption lines have been observed with the FUSE satellite\nin the spectrum of some Herbig Ae stars (HAes) and show the presence of warm (Tgas > 300\nK) molecular hydrogen gas in the CS environment of these stars (Martin-Za\u0131\u0308di et al. 2007).\nHowever, absorption observations require specific configurations to observe the gas within the\ndisks, i.e. nearly edge-on. Due to the high inclination angles to the lines of sight estimated\nfor the disks observed by Martin-Za\u0131\u0308di et al. (2007), the detected H2 is not in the disk. Those\nauthors concluded that the lines of sight probably pass through a thin layer of warm/hot\ngas above the surface of the disk which is produced by the photoevaporation of the disk.\nSearches for mid-IR H2 rotational emission lines have been performed using different spaceand ground-based instruments. Space-based instruments on ISO and Spitzer have low spectral and spatial resolution, and therefore have not yielded an unambiguous detection of H2\nline emission from protoplanetary disks (Thi et al. 2001; Pascucci et al. 2006). Indeed, when\ndetections of H2 towards a few pre-main sequence stars have been claimed with ISO-SWS\n(Thi et al. 2001), ground-based observations showed that contamination from surrounding\ncloud material was important and that ISO detections were likely not dominated by the\nemission of the disk gas (e.g. Richter et al. 2002; Sako et al. 2005). Recently, Carmona et al.\n(2007) estimated the line-to-continuum ratio that should be observed for H2 transitions in\nthe mid-IR. They used a two-layer model (Chiang & Goldreich 1997; Dullemond et al. 2001)\nof a gas-rich disk (column density of N(H2 )=1023 cm\u22122 ) seen face-on, located at 140 pc from\nthe Sun, with local thermodynamics equilibrium (LTE) for the gas and dust, Tgas =Tdust , and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nassuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio about 100. Those authors concluded that the expected\npeak flux of the S(1) line at 17.035 \u03bcm, observed at a spectral resolution of 20 000, should\nbe less than 0.3% of that of the continuum at temperatures higher than 150 K, and thus\nshould not be observable with the existing instruments. Indeed, they did not detect any H2\nmid-IR emission line in their sample of 6 Herbig Ae stars.\nHowever, H2 rotational lines have been recently detected in the disk around one Herbig\nAe star, namely AB Aur, with the high spectral and spatial resolution TEXES spectrometer\n(Bitner et al. 2007). These detections imply that H2 can be observed in the mid-IR domain\nwhen particular physical conditions exist in disks.\nThe VLT Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed (VISIR; Lagage et al. 2004)\nhas the high spectral (10 000 < R < 30 000) and spatial resolution necessary to pick up such\nnarrow gas lines from the disks. In addition, high spectral resolution is a key element to\ndisentangle the H2 line from the absorption lines due to the Earth's atmosphere. The spectral\nranges covered by VISIR offer access to the most intense pure rotational lines of molecular\nhydrogen (H2 ): S(1) (v = 0 \u2212 0, J = 3 \u2212 1) at 17.0348 \u03bcm, S(2) (v = 0 \u2212 0, J = 4 \u2212 2) at\n12.2786 \u03bcm, S(3) (v = 0 \u2212 0, J = 5 \u2212 3) at 9.6649 \u03bcm, and S(4) (v = 0 \u2212 0, J = 6 \u2212 4) at\n8.0250 \u03bcm. The S(0) (v = 0 \u2212 0, J = 2 \u2212 0) transition near 28 \u03bcm is not observable from\nthe ground due to the Earth's atmospheric absorption.\nA particularly interesting object to study the CS material around a pre-main sequence\nintermediate mass star is HD97048. HD97048 is a nearby, relatively isolated Herbig A0/B9\nstar located in the Chameleon cloud at a distance of 180 pc (van den Ancker et al. 1998).\nIts age has been estimated from evolutionary tracks to be of the order of 3 million years\n(kindly computed by L. Testi and A. Palacios). This star is known to be surrounded by an\nextended CS disk. The VISIR imaging observations of this star conducted in 2005 June 17\nand 19, have revealed an extended emission of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons)\nat the surface of a flared disk inclined to the line of sight by 42.8+0.8\n\u22122.5 degrees (Lagage et al.\n2006). This is the only Herbig star for which the flaring of the disk has been observed by\ndirect imaging. The flaring index has been measured to be 1.26\u00b10.05, in good agreement\nwith hydrostatic flared disk models (Lagage et al. 2006; Doucet et al. 2007). This geometry\nimplies that a large amount of gas should be present to support the flaring structure and\nthat the disk is at an early stage of evolution. This star is thus one of the best candidates\nto study the gas component in the disks of HAe stars.\nIn this paper, we present VISIR observations of the S(1) pure rotational emission line\nof molecular hydrogen at 17.03 \u03bcm arising from the disk of HD97048.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nHD97048 was observed for 1800s with the high spectral resolution long-slit mode of\nVISIR in June 22, 2006. The central wavelength of the observation was set to 17.035 \u03bcm.\nWe used the 0.75\" slit, providing a spectral resolution about 10 000, i.e. \u2206v=30 km s\u22121 .\nThe weather conditions were very good and stable during the observations; the optical seeing was less than 0.66\" and the airmass (<1.8) was close to the minimum airmass\naccessible when observing this object from the Paranal ESO observatory. The standard\n\"chopping and nodding\" technique was used to suppress the large sky and telescope background dominating at mid-infrared wavelengths. Secondary mirror chopping was performed\nin the North-South direction with an amplitude of 8\" at a frequency of 0.025 Hz. Nodding\ntechnique, necessary to compensate for chopping residuals, was applied using a telescope\noffset of 8\" in the South direction, every 3 minutes. The pixel scale is 0.127\"/pixel resulting\nin a total field of view along the slit about 32.5\". The elementary frames were combined\nto obtain chopping/nodding corrected data. VISIR detector is affected by stripes randomly\ntriggered by some abnormal high-gain pixels. A dedicated destriping method has been developped to suppress them (Pantin 2007, in preparation). In order to correct the spectrum from\nthe Earth's atmospheric absorption and obtain the absolute flux calibration, we observed\nthe CERES asteroid and the standard star HD89388 (see www.eso.org/VISIR/catalogue)\njust before and after observing HD97048. HD89388 and CERES were observed at nearly the\nsame airmass and seeing conditions as the object. As shown in Fig. 1b, airmasses are slightly\ndifferent between the observation of CERES and that of HD97048. However, the discrepancy\nbetween the two spectra of the sky cannot be responsible for the emission feature we observe\nin the HD97048 spectrum around 17.035\u03bcm, i.e. the H2 line (Fig. 1a). We thus have divided\nthe spectrum of HD97048 by that of CERES (which has a much better signal-to-noise ratio\nthan that of the standard star HD89388) to correct for the telluric absorption, and used the\nHD89388 observed and modelled spectra (Cohen et al. 1999) to obtain the absolute flux calibration. The wavelength calibration is done by fitting the observed sky background features\nwith a model of the Paranal's atmospheric emission.\nWe note that Valenti et al. (2000) found Av =0.24 mag from the fit of the IUE spectrum of HD97048, thus we have not corrected the spectrum for dust extinction, since it is\nneglectible in our wavelength range for Av < 40 mag (Fluks et al. 1994).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2a, we have detected the H2 pure rotational S(1) line near 17.03\n\u03bcm. In the flux-calibrated spectrum, the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the continuum flux was\ncalculated in regions less influenced by telluric absorption, and close to the feature of interest.\nWe deduced a 6\u03c3 detection in amplitude for the line, corresponding to a signal-to-noise of\nabout 11\u03c3 for the line, when integrating the signal over a resolution element (6 pixels). The\nline is not resolved as we can fit it with a Gaussian with a full width at half maximum\nequal to a spectral resolution element of 30 km s\u22121 (see Fig. 2a). From our fit, assuming the\nemission arises from an isothermal mass of optically thin H2 , we derived an integrated flux\nin the line of 2.4\u00d710\u221217 W m\u22122 or 2.4\u00d710\u221214 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nOnce the spectrum is corrected from the Earth's rotation, and knowing the heliocentric\nradial velocity of HD97048 (+21 km s\u22121 ; Acke et al. 2005), we estimated, from the wavelength\nposition of the Gaussian peak, the radial velocity of H2 to be about 4\u00b12 km s\u22121 in the star's\nrest frame. We thus considered that the radial velocity of the H2 is similar to that of the star,\nimplying that the emitting gas is bound to the star. The H2 line is not resolved spatially.\nGiven the VISIR spatial resolution of about 0.427\" at 17.03 \u03bcm, and the star distance (180\npc from the sun), we can assess that the emitting H2 is located within the inner 35 AU of the\ndisk (Fig. 2b). We estimated the corresponding column densities and masses as a function\nof prescribed temperatures (Table 1). For this purpose, we first assumed that the line is\noptically thin and that the radiation is isotropic. In this context, assuming that the first\nrotational levels (up to J = 3) of H2 are thermalized, and thus that their populations follow\nthe Boltzmann law for a given temperature (LTE), the column densities are derived from\nthe following formula:\n\nIul =\n\nhc\nNu (H2 )Aul\n4\u03c0\u03bb\n\nergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr \u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Iul is the integrated intensity of the line, \u03bb is the wavelength of the transition J = u\u2212l,\nAul is the spontaneous transition probability, Nu (H2 ) is the column density of the upper\nrotational level of the transition. Since the line is not spatially resolved, we calculated a\nlower limit on Iul by dividing the integrated flux value by the solid angle of the point spread\nfunction, and thus obtained lower limits on the total column densities. Under the same\nassumptions as used for the calculations of the column densities and assuming that the\nmedium we observe is homogeneous, the mass of warm H2 is given by (Thi et al. 2001):\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nMgas = f \u00d7 1.76 \u00d7 10\u221220\n\nFul d2\nM\u2299\n(hc/4\u03c0\u03bb)Aul xu (T )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ful is the line flux, d the distance in pc to the star, xu (T ) is the fractional population\nof the level u at the temperature T in LTE (for details on the calculation method, see\nvan Dishoeck 1992), f is the conversion factor required for deriving the total gas mass from\nthe H2 -ortho or H2 -para mass. Since MH2 =MH2 (ortho)+MH2 (para), f =1+1/(ortho/para)\nfor the S(1) line (a H2 -ortho transition). The equilibrium ortho-para ratio at the temperature\nT was computed using Takahashi & Uehara (2001).\nWe also estimated the dust mass producing the flux level of the continuum in the\nspectrum. We used a simple model of optically thin emission of a given mass of dust at the\nsurface of a disk. The grains have sizes between 0.01 and 100 \u03bcm and a size distribution\nfollowing a power-law with an index of -3.5. A fixed composition, mixture of amorphous\nsilicates (50%) and amorphous carbon (50%) is assumed. For different temperatures (150,\n300, 1000 K) assigned to the dust, we computed the corresponding mass of dust and derived\ngas-to-dust mass ratios. Our results are tabulated in Table 1.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur high resolution spectroscopic observation of the S(1) pure rotational line of H2 at\n17.03 \u03bcm of HD97048 has revealed the presence of significant amounts of warm gas in the\ninner 35 AU of the disk. From a gaussian fit of the emission line, we derived very high\ncolumn densities of warm gas, which are more than two orders of magnitude higher than\nthose generally observed in the CS environment of Herbig Ae stars (Martin-Za\u0131\u0308di et al. 2007).\nThis confirms that HD97048 is a young object surrounded by a circumstellar disk at an early\nstage of evolution. Indeed photoevaporation of the gas is expected to clear up the inner part\nof the disk within 3 million years (Takeuchi et al. 2005).\nWe derived masses of the warm gas in the range from 10\u22122 to nearly 1 MJup (1 MJup \u223c\n10\u22123 M\u2299 ) depending on the adopted temperature, and assuming LTE. The masses derived\nhere are lower than those of Lagage et al. (2006) who have estimated a minimum mass of\ngas in the inner disk to be of the order of 3 MJup . But it should be pointed out that mid-IR\nH2 lines are only probing warm gas located in the surface layer of the disk, when a higher\nmass of colder gas is expected to be present in the interior layers of the disk. In any case,\nthe finding of warm molecular hydrogen reinforces the claim that a large amount of cold gas\nis present in the disk to support its flaring geometry (Lagage et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIt is generally accepted that the first rotational levels (J) of H2 are populated by thermal\ncollisions, an excitation mechanism which requires kinetic temperatures higher than 150 K\nto produce the S(1) transition. Assuming equal dust and gas temperatures, we estimated\ndust masses responsible for the continuum emission and derived gas-to-dust mass ratios in\nthe range from 3260 to 14164 (Table 1), much larger than the canonical value of 100. These\ncrude estimates are in agreement with more sophisticated models such as two-layer LTE\ndisk models (Carmona et al. 2007). Indeed, by scaling the gas-to-dust mass ratio found\nhere to the canonical value of 100, we obtained a peak line flux of about 0.46% of that of\nthe continuum at 150 K, decreasing to 0.1% of the continuum at 1000 K, which is close to\nthe line-to-conitnuum ratios calculated in disks models by Carmona et al. (2007). Thus one\npossible interpretation of our observation is that the dust is partially depleted from the disk\nsurface layer, where the H2 emission originates. The spatial decoupling between the gas and\nthe dust may be due to dust settling or dust coagulation into larger particles.\nHowever, other excitation mechanism cannot be excluded. Several competing mechanisms could contribute to the excitation of molecular hydrogen such as UV pumping, shocks,\nX-rays, etc..., (see review papers by Habart et al. 2004; Snow & McCall 2006) and could be\nresponsible for the observed emission. Weak X-ray emission has been detected from HD97048\nby ROSAT (Zinnecker & Preibisch 1994). X-rays and UV photons are likely candidates to\nheat the gas to temperatures significantly higher than those of the dust (Glassgold et al.\n2007) and could partly explain a high line-to-continuum ratio. According to radiative transfer models of disks around T Tauri stars (Nomura & Millar 2005; Nomura et al. 2007), X-ray\nheating could significantly increase the line-to-continuum flux ratio, but, applying the same\nincrease factor to HAes, the S(1) H2 line would still be below the detection limit of VISIR.\nNote that the present VISIR observation does not allow us to discriminate between the\ndifferent possible physical origins of the emission of H2 . New observations of HD97048 will\nbe performed with VISIR in order to observe the other pure rotational lines of H2 . The\ndetection of these lines would help to better constrain the temperature (and thus the mass)\nof the warm gas.\nOur results are very similar to those obtained by Bitner et al. (2007) for AB Aur with\nthe TEXES instrument. Indeed, those authors have shown that the emitting warm gas is\nlocated in the inner 18 AU of the disk around AB Aur. For the two stars, the gas has not\ncompletely dissipated in the inner region of the disk in a lifetime of about 3 Myrs. HD97048\nand AB Aur have nearly identical astrophysical parameters (Teff , age, mass, distance). Their\ndisks are flared (Pantin et al. 2005; Lagage et al. 2006) and seem to be in similar evolutionary\nstates, which could well be a disk old enough such that the dust sedimenation/coagulation\nhas already been at work, but young enough such that the gas has not yet been photoevapo-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nrated. It is not possible to draw definite conclusions with only two examples and it would be\ninteresting to observe other HAe stars similar to AB Aur and HD97048. The high angular\nresolution and high spectral resolution available with ground-based instruments are key advantages over space-based instruments such as ISO-SWS in order to obtain firm detections\nof H2 from disks.\nThis work is based on observations obtained at ESO/VLT (Paranal) with VISIR, program number 077.C-0309(B).
