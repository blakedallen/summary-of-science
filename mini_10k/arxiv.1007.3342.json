We succeeded in detecting the zero-mode\n(n=0) Landau level and its spin splitting in the magnetic field normal to the 2D plane. We demonstrated that the effective Coulomb interaction in the magnetic field intensifies the spin splitting of\nzero-mode Landau carriers. At temperatures below 2K, magnetic fields above several Tesla break\nthe twofold valley degeneracy.\nPACS numbers: 72.90.+y, 73.43.Qt, 78.30.Jw\n\nSince Novoselov et al. [1] and Zhang et al. [2]\nexperimentally demonstrated that graphene is a zerogap system with massless Dirac particles, such systems\nhave fascinated physicists as a source of exotic systems\nand/or new physics. At the same time, the quasitwo-dimensional (Q2D) organic conductor \u03b1-(BEDTTTF)2 I3 (BEDT-TTF=bis(ethylenedithio) tetrathiafulvalene) [3] was found to be a new type of massless Dirac\nfermion (MDF) system under high pressure [4\u20139]. In contrast to graphene, this is the first bulk (multilayered)\nzero-gap material with Dirac cone type energy dispersion. Another important difference is the fact that according to the band calculation [4, 5] or the first principles band calculation [6], the present system has tilted\nDirac cones. Hence, the Fermi velocity, vF , is highly\nanisotropic. Thus, \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2 I3 provides us a new\ntype of MDF system with a layered structure and an\nanisotropic vF .\nOne of the characteristic features of transport in the\nmultilayered MDF system is clearly observed in the interlayer magnetoresistance shown in Fig. 1(a) [9]. The results are interpreted as follows.\nIn the magnetic field, the energy of Landau levelsp(LLs) in zero-gap systems is expressed as EnLL =\n\u00b1 2e~vF2 |n||B|, where n is the Landau index and B is\nthe magnetic field strength [10]. One important difference between zero-gap conductors and conventional conductors is the appearance of a (n=0) LL at zero energy\nwhen magnetic fields are applied normal to the 2D plane.\nThis special LL is called the zero-mode. Since the energy\nof this level is EF irrespective of the field strength, the\nFermi distribution function is always 1/2. It means that\nhalf of the Landau states in the zero mode are occupied.\nNote that in each LL, there are states whose density is\nproportional to B. The magnetic field, thus, creates mobile carriers.\nFor kB T < E1LL , most of the mobile carriers are in the\nzero-mode. Such a situation is called the quantum limit.\nThe carrier density per valley and per spin direction in\nthe quantum limit is given by D(B) = B/2\u03c60 , where\n\u03c60 = h/e is the quantum flux. The factor 1/2 is the Fermi\n\ndistribution function at EF . This effect is detected in the\ninter-layer resistance, Rzz , in the longitudinal magnetic\nfield. In this field configuration, the interaction between\nthe electrical current and the magnetic field is weak because they are parallel to each other. Hence, the effect\nof the magnetic field appears only through the change in\nthe carrier density. In this regard, the large change in\nthe density of zero-mode carriers gives rise to remarkable\nnegative magnetoresistance in the low magnetic field region, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It is written as Rzz \u221d 1/B.\nThis behavior agrees well with the realistic theory of Osada [11].\nAt a high magnetic field, on the other hand, the Zeeman effect plays an important role in zero-mode carriers.\nIn a magnetic field, each LL is split into two levels with\nenergies EnLL \u00b1 \u2206Es /2, where \u2206Es =g \u2217 \u03bcB B is the spinsplitting and g \u2217 is the effective g-factor. This change in\nthe energy structure gives rise to a change in the carrier density in LLs. At a low temperature and/or a high\nmagnetic field, where kB T < \u2206Es , this effect becomes\nimportant because the energy level is shifted from the\nposition of EF . It works to reduce the density. The magnetoresistance changes from negative to positive, and is\ndependent on the magnetic field and the temperature as\nRzz \u221d 1/D(B) * exp(g \u2217 \u03bcB B/2kB T ).\n\n(1)\n\nHence, Rzz *B obeys the exponential law as shown in Fig.\n1(b) at a high magnetic field.\nThe detection of the zero-mode and its spin-split level\nat a low field strongly indicates the high purity of our\nsystem and leads our investigation to a new stage. Each\nzero-mode in this system has twofold degeneracy (valley\ndegeneracy) originating from two Dirac cones in the first\nBrillouin zone [4\u20136]. According to the simple Stornerlike theory of quantum Hall ferromagnetism [12], the\nCoulomb interaction plays an important role in spin and\nvalley symmetries in the magnetic field. In this paper, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that the valley degeneracy\nin this system is broken at magnetic fields above several\nTesla at temperatures below 2 K. In graphene, on the\nother hand, this state was realized in the magnetic field\n\n\f2\n\nIt should exceed\n\u221a 2 and depends on the magnetic field\nbecause I \u221d B.\nThis effect can be seen in Rzz under a longitudinal\nmagnetic field (Fig. 1(a)). At the minimum, we have\ng \u2217 \u03bcB B \u223c \u0393, where \u0393 is the scattering broadening energy or the thermal broadening energy of each LL [11].\nAt a high magnetic field, on the other hand, Rzz obeys\nan exponential law as Eq. (1). Note that Rzz can detect only the charge gap, \u2206E, between levels that are\nnearest to EF , assuming that EF always locates at the\ncontact point. In the valley degenerate state, hence,\n\u2206E = \u2206Es = g \u2217 \u03bcB B. The magnetoresistance in the\nvalley splitting state, however, is characterized by the\ncharge gap between (\u2193, \u2212) and (\u2191, +), \u2206E = \u2206Es \u2212 \u2206v ,\nwhere \u2206v is the valley splitting, and we describe the level\nstructure of the zero mode using spin index (\u2191, \u2193) and valley index (+, \u2212), as shown in Fig. 2.\nIn our previous work, we published data for Rzz at\nmagnetic fields of up to 7 T and succeeded in detecting\nthe zero-mode and its spin-split level [9]. To demonstrate\nthat the magnetic fields break the valley degeneracy in\nthis system at low temperatures, however, a higher magnetic field becomes important. In this work, we examined\nthe magnetoresistance at magnetic fields of up to 14 T in\nthe temperature region below 4.1 K.\nA sample to which four electrical leads were attached\nwas encased in a Teflon capsule filled with pressure\nmedium (Idemitsu DN-oil 7373). The capsule was set\nin a clamp-type pressure cell made of MP35N hard alloy\nand hydrostatic pressure of up to 1.7 GPa was applied.\nResistance measurements were carried out using the conventional DC method with the electrical current applied\nalong the c-crystal axis, which is normal to the 2D plane.\nFigure 1(a) shows the magnetic field dependence of\nRzz below 4.1 K. It reproduces well our previous data\npublished in Ref. [9].

This critical field strength depends on\nthe scattering broadening energy of the zero-mode. The\nbroadening energy of the LLs in our system is much lower\nthan that in graphene. Another important fact is that\naccording to the theory of Kobayashi et al., when the\nDirac cone is tilted, the long-range Coulomb interaction\nhas finite matrix elements between valleys, and it breaks\nthe valley degeneracy in the magnetic field (Fig. 2) [14].\nWe succeeded in obtaining evidence of the valley-split\nlevels in our material, as follows.\nIn the magnetic field, the effective Coulomb interaction\nenhances the spin splitting as,\np\n\u2206Es = g\u03bcB B + \u03c0/2I,\n(2)\n\u221a\nwhere g \u223c 2 is the g-factor, I \u223c e2 /\u01eblH \u223c 50 B/\u01eb meV\nis thep\neffective Coulomb interaction in the magnetic field,\nlH = ~/eB is the magnetic length, and \u01eb is the effective\npolarizability.

In the interpretation of Rzz in Ref. [9],\nhowever, we did not take into consideration the Coulomb\ninteraction. The Coulomb interaction should be taken\ninto consideration because it has a significant influence\non the transport phenomena in the magnetic field.\nThus, the first step is to verify the effective Coulomb\n\u2217\ninteraction in this system from the effective g-factor gmin\n\u2217\nestimated from the relationship gmin\n\u03bcB Bmin \u223c \u0393 at the\nmagnetoresistance minimum. Here, broadening energy \u0393\nshould be proportional to kB T because Bmin decreases\nlinearly with decreasing temperature, as shown in Fig.\n1(d). It can be written approximately as \u0393 = \u03930 + 2kB T\nfrom the investigation of the relationship between \u0393 and\nthe temperature from the simulation calculation of Rzz\nalong Ref. [11]. The scattering broadening energy, \u03930 , is\nroughly estimated to be about 3 K as follows.\nSince each LL is broadened by the scattering of carriers\nand/or thermal energy, the zero-mode is sure to overlap\nwith the other LLs at a low magnetic field.

(2) (blue line) or (3) (red line), with \u01eb \u223c 190.\n\nregion, the relationship of Rzz \u221d 1/B loses its validity.\nWe can recognize this region in Fig. 1(b) where a positive magnetoresistance is observed. This critical field,\nBp , shifts to a lower field with decreasing temperature\ndown to about 2 K, where it almost saturates at about\n0.04 T, as shown in Figs. 1(b) and (d). The overlap between the zero-mode and other LLs, primarily the n=1\nLL will be sufficiently small above Bp and as a result,\nthe negative magnetoresistance is observed there. Then,\nwe have a tentative relationship: E1LL \u223c 2kB Tp at Bp .\nIn fact, E1LL with vF \u223c 4 \u00d7 104 cm/s is reproduced well\nexcept in the temperature region below 2 K. This Fermi\nvelocity vF corresponds to that estimated from the temperature dependence of the carrier density, N , written as\nN \u221d (T /v\u0304F )2 , with v\u0304F \u223c 105 m/s within a factor of 3 [8].\nThe discrepancy of the data from the curve of E1LL below\n2 K, on the other hand, suggests that thermal energy is\nsufficiently lower than the scattering broadening energy\n\u03930 . Thus, \u03930 is roughly estimated to be approximately\np\n3 K from the constant value of Bp as \u03930 = 2e~vF2 |Bp |\n[15]. Note that in the estimation of \u03930 , we did not consider the spin splitting because \u03930 has little impact. This\nscattering broadening energy is much lower than that of\ngraphene. In graphene, \u03930 was estimated to be about 30\nK [16].\n\u2217\n\u2217\nUsing the relationship gmin\n\u03bcB Bmin \u223c \u0393, gmin\nat each\ntemperature is estimated as shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b).\nIt gives us definite evidence that the effective Coulomb\ninteraction intensifies the spin splitting as follows.\n\u2217\nFirst, at each temperature or magnetic field, gmin\nexceeds 2. It increases by about three times from about\n4.5 at 4.1 K to nearly 12 at 0.1 K, as shown in Fig.\n3(a). Note that this strong temperature dependence of\n\u2217\ngmin\nmay arise from the effect of its strong magnetic field\ndependence because Bmin depends strongly on temperature, as shown in Fig. 1(d). In fact, we can find this\n\u2217\neffect in the magnetic field dependence of gmin\nshown in\nFig. 3(b). In the case of a system without the effective\nCoulomb interaction (I=0), g \u2217 should always be 2 in the\n\u2217\nmagnetic field. However, gmin\ndepends strongly on\u221athe\nmagnetic field, as shown in Fig. 3(b). It obeys 1/ B.\nAssuming that \u01eb is independent of temperature and using\nEq.

(b) \u2206E for B= 7 T below 1 K.\n\nThis simple formula reproduces the data well and shows\nevidence that the effective Coulomb interaction plays an\nimportant role in the spin splitting of this system. In\nparticular, at a low magnetic field, this effect is strengthened. Here, we note that \u01eb \u223c 190 is the effective polarizability when the Coulomb interaction engages directly\nin the spin splitting. Thus, this is the upper limit of this\nsystem. Recently, Morinari and Tohyama performed a\nsimulation calculation for in-plane magnetoresistance using this effective polarizability [17], and our anomalous\ndata [7] are quantitatively reproduced.\nTo conclude, we can detect the effect of Coulomb interaction probed by inter-layer magnetoresistance measurements in this system. According to the simple Stornerlike theory of quantum Hall ferromagnetism [12], the\nstrong Coulomb interaction leads us to summarize that\nthe twofold valley degeneracy\np may be broken at a high\nmagnetic field that satisfies \u03c0/2I > \u0393.\nThe last step is to determine the effect of valley splitting in the magnetic field. At 7 T, for example, the effective Coulomb energy exceeds \u0393 below 2 K. Thus, we\nexpect that this effect appears in the effective g-factor,\n\u2217\ngexp\n, estimated from the resistance curve obeying Eq. (1)\nas shown in Fig. 1(b), at temperatures below 2 K and 7\nT.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nAt temperatures above 2 K, gexp\n\u223c gmin\n, as shown in\nFig. 3(a). The slight difference arise from the effective\nCoulomb interaction obeying Eq. (3). At 7 T, for exam\u2217\nple, \u2206E = gexp\n\u03bcB B \u223c \u2206Es \u223c 18 K (Fig. 4).\n\u2217\nThe behavior of gexp\nand \u2206E below 2 K is much more\nimpressive. Both abruptly drop by approximately 1/50\n\u2217\n\u2217\ntimes from gexp\n\u223c 3.8 and \u2206E \u223c 18 K at 2 K to gexp\n\u223c\n0.08 and \u2206E \u223c 0.4 K at 0.07 K. Judging from the detection of a strong effective Coulomb interaction, we ascribe\n\u2217\nthe drop of gexp\nand \u2206E in Figs. 3(a) and 4 to the breaking valley degeneracy in the magnetic field above several\nTesla, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In graphene, it was realized at magnetic fields above 20 T [12] and the realistic\ntheory established that the strong Coulomb interaction\nbroke the valley symmetry at a high magnetic field [13].\nIn our system, on the other hand, \u0393 is much lower than\nthat of graphene and therefore, we could detect the effect\nof valley splitting at a low magnetic field. At 2 K, for ex-\n\n\f4\nample,\nthe critical magnetic field strength that satisfies\np\n\u03c0/2I > \u0393 is about 7 T. At 1 K, it is about 4 T.\nBased on this speculation, valley splitting in our system can be estimated tentatively as \u2206v = \u2206Es \u2212 \u2206E.\nAt 7 T, for example, valley splitting abruptly emerges at\nabout 2 K and increases up to approximately 17 K at\n0.07 K, as shown in Fig. 4(a).\nRecently, Kobayashi et al. predicted the pseudo-spin\npolarized ferromagnetic state with an easy plane where\n\u2206v > \u2206Es as shown in Fig. 2(b) [14]. In this state,\nexcited vortices and anti-vortices can move and the system may undergo the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition to form pairs of vortices and anti-vortices at the\nlowest temperature. Our data, however, suggest the situation \u2206v < \u2206Es , as shown in Fig. 2(a).\nExamining \u2206E data below 1 K in more detail (Fig.\n4(b)), we find that it seems to go across zero and then\nthe pseudo-spin polarized ferromagnetic state in which\nthe levels between (\u2193, \u2212) and (\u2191, +) cross may be realized\nbelow 0.07 K (Fig. 2(b)). We also expect that this state\nwould be realized at a high magnetic field. The data below 0.8 K in Figs. 1(a) and (b) are apparently discrepant\nfrom Eq. (1) at a high magnetic field. The saturation\nof Rzz may indicate a symptom of the crossover to the\npseudo-spin polarized ferromagnetic state at a high magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 2(b).\nLastly, we briefly mention the mobility edge in this system at a low temperature and a high magnetic field. In\nFig. 4(b), we perceive the fact that \u2206E below 0.1 K is\nlower than \u03930 \u223c 3 K and yet, Rzz at 7 T is much higher\nthan that at the minimum. At 0.07 K, for example, \u2206E\nis approximately 0.4 K. It arises from the localization of\nelectrons on the tails of the broadened zero-mode. When\nLL is broadened by scattering, only the electrons at the\nvicinity of center EnLL are mobile. This critical energy\nEnLL \u00b1 Ec is called mobility edge. The smaller the Landau radius is, the stronger the localization is. The effect\nof localization also depends on the temperature.

The effective\nCoulomb interaction plays an important role in intensifying the spin splitting of zero-mode carriers. Hence,\nthe effective g-factor exceeds 2 \u221a\nand depends strongly on\nthe magnetic field as g \u2217 \u221d 1/ B. The twofold valley\ndegeneracy, on the p\nother hand, is broken in the magnetic\nfield that satisfies \u03c0/2I > \u0393. At 7 T, valley splitting\nabruptly emerges at about 2 K and increases up to approximately 17 K at 0.07 K. This system is very pure and\ntherefore, we could detect the effects of Coulomb interaction and its associated valley splitting in the magnetic\nfield, which is much lower than that of graphene.\nRecently, the multilayered MDF system was also realized in one of the parent compounds of the oxypnictide superconductors [18]. This MDF system, however, is not simple because this compound has multiband structure and therefore some Fermi surfaces. In\nthis sense, \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2 I3 provides a suitable testing ground for the transport of the multilayered MDF\nsystem. According to the theory by Shon and Ando,\nthe mono-layered MDF system show a universal conductance, \u03c3xx \u223c 2e2 /\u03c0 2 ~, which is independent of the magnetic field, the temperature and the scattering at Dirac\npoint [19]. In the multilayered MDF system, however, the\ntunneling between layers reflects the broadening of zeromode and it loses the validity of universal conductance in\nthe magnetic field. Realistic theory reproduced well our\nanomalous in-plane magnetoresistance [7, 17]. Further\ninvestigation will lead us to new phenomena characterized by the multilayered MDF system.\nWe thank Dr. A.
