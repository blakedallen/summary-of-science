Awschalom*\nCenter for Spintronics and Quantum Computation, University of California, Santa\nBarbara, California 93106, USA\n*\ne-mail: awsch@physics.ucsb.edu\nThe nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond is a promising atomic-scale system\nfor solid-state quantum information processing. Its spin-dependent\nphotoluminescence has enabled sensitive measurements on single N-V centers, such\nas: electron spin resonance1, Rabi oscillations2, single-shot spin readout3 and twoqubit operations with a nearby 13C nuclear spin4. Furthermore, room temperature\nspin coherence times as long as 58 \u03bcs have been reported for N-V center ensembles5.\nHere, we have developed an angle-resolved magneto-photoluminescence microscopy\napparatus to investigate the anisotropic electron spin interactions of single N-V\ncenters at room temperature. We observe negative peaks in the photoluminescence\nas a function of both magnetic field magnitude and angle that are explained by\ncoherent spin precession and anisotropic relaxation at spin level anti-crossings. In\naddition, precise field alignment unmasks the resonant coupling to neighboring\n\"dark\" nitrogen spins that are not otherwise detected by photoluminescence. The\nlatter results demonstrate a means of investigating small numbers of dark spins via\na single bright spin under ambient conditions.\n\n1\n\n\fThe nitrogen-vacancy defect pair has an anisotropic electron spin Hamiltonian\ndue to its trigonal symmetry6 and spin-orbit coupling7. Consequently, the degree of spin\nlevel mixing and coupling to nearby impurity spins is very sensitive to the orientation of\nan applied magnetic field, which has not been controlled in previous experiments on\nsingle N-V centers. Figure 1a depicts the atomic structure and relevant energy levels of\nthe (negatively charged) N-V center. The triplet (3A) ground state8,9,10 has a zero-field\nsplitting between the mS = 0 and mS = \u00b11 sublevels quantized along the N-V\nsymmetry axis, a 111 crystal axis11. Zero-field spin splittings have also been measured\nin the triplet (3E) excited state but there is no consensus on the arrangement of\nsublevels12,13,14,15. Linearly polarized optical excitation of the 3A \u2192 3E transition\npreferentially pumps the spin system into the 0 ground state sublevel16. In addition, the\naverage photon emission rate is substantially smaller for transitions involving the \u00b1 1\nlevels than for the 0 level3, which enables the spin state to be determined by the\nphotoluminescence (PL) intensity. Both of the latter two effects have been attributed to\nspin-dependent intersystem crossing to the singlet (1A) level17.\nHere, the phonon-broadened transition between the 3E and 3A states is detected\nvia non-resonant PL (see Methods). For example, Fig. 1b is a spatial image of the\nspectrally-integrated PL from a diamond sample with the laser focused roughly 1 \u03bcm\nbelow the surface. Multiple resolution-limited features are observed within the 20\u00d720 \u03bcm\nfield. In order to determine that a given feature is due to a single emitter, a histogram is\nplotted of the time \u03c4 between consecutive photon detection events using a Hanbury\nBrown and Twiss detection geometry18, yielding the experimental intensity correlation\n\n2\n\n\ffunction g(2)(\u03c4). Figure 1c shows data from a color center labeled NV1. The value of\ng(2)(0) is below 0.5, proving that NV1 is a single color center19. In addition, the rise of\ng(2)(\u03c4) above unity with increasing |\u03c4| is indicative of intersystem crossing to the 1A metastable state19,20.\nThese single photon emitters are further characterized by optically detected\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) (see Methods). Figure 1d contains data from NV1 with\nzero applied magnetic field. In this case, the \u00b1 1 ground state levels are degenerate so\nthat only one resonance (mS = 0 \u2192 \u00b11) is observed at 2.87 GHz, the characteristic zerofield splitting of N-V centers11. The data is fit with a Lorentzian of 11 MHz FWHM\n(solid line), which is comparable to previous measurements on similar diamond samples1.\nPrevious strain-dependent optical measurements on ensembles of N-V centers\nindicated that electric dipole transitions are allowed for dipoles in the plane perpendicular\nto the symmetry axis6. Figure 2a depicts an N-V center with transition dipoles X|| [1 1 2]\nand Y|| [1 1 0] in a (111) plane. The excitation is along [001] for all measurements,\ntherefore, IPL depends on the laser polarization angle \u03c6 due to unequal excitation of the\ntwo dipoles. The dependence of IPL on \u03c6 is measured for twenty N-V centers and exhibits\neither vertical or horizontal lobes, as exemplified for three N-V centers in Fig. 2b. The\nmeasured anisotropies, defined as the ratio IPL(\u03c6 = 0\u00b0)/IPL(\u03c6 = 90\u00b0), are roughly 2:1 and\n1:2 on average; a simple anisotropy calculation gives 3:1, 3:1, 1:3, and 1:3 for the N-V\nsymmetry axis along [111], [1 1 1] , [1 1 1] and [1 11] , respectively (see Methods). The\nmeasured data are modified by the presence of polarized background PL (subtracted from\nthe data) and a small dip, most visible for NV2 at \u03c6 = 0\u00b0, which varies in depth from\n\n3\n\n\fcenter to center. Nevertheless, comparison of the measured and calculated anisotropies\nenables the number of possible orientations of a given center to be reduced from four to\ntwo.\nThe double degeneracy of the polarization anisotropy is lifted by application of a\nmagnetic field B. The upper panel of Fig. 2c shows the ground state spin levels as a\nfunction of |B| calculated using the Hamiltonian7 H = g\u03bcBB*S + D(Sz2 \u2013 S(S+1)/3), where\n\n\u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, g = 2.0, S = 1 and D = 2.88 GHz. A level anti-crossing (LAC)\nnear 1000 G is predicted for an N-V center with symmetry axis at a small angle to B (6\u00b0;\nsolid lines), but not for a large angle (55\u00b0; dashed lines). The middle panel is a plot of\n|\u03b1|2, the coefficient of 0 z , calculated for both angles and for each spin level,\nmS = \u03b1 0 z + \u03b2 \u2212 1 z + \u03b3 + 1 z , where the z subscript denotes the [111] basis; the plot\n\nshows how the spin states mix with |B| and will be used to model the data below. The\nlower panel is a plot of IPL as a function of |B|, with a ~1\u00b0 angle between B and [111], for\nthe same three N-V centers as in Fig. 2b. Whereas NV1 and NV2 have similar\npolarization dependences, their field dependences reveal that the symmetry axis of NV1\n(NV2) is (non-)parallel to B. For NV1, the negative peak at ~1000 G coincides with the\ncalculated LAC. Additionally, NV1 exhibits a peak at ~500 G, the origin of which is less\nclear.\nIn order to investigate these peaks further, IPL is measured as a function of |B|\nwith B at a series of angles \u03b8 in the (1 1 0 ) plane; a selection of such data from NV1 is\ndisplayed in Fig. 3a. As B approaches the [111] direction (\u03b8 \u2192 0\u00b0), the LAC peak gets\nnarrower, as expected from previous ensemble measurements21,22. At sufficiently small\nangles, however, the LAC peak amplitude decreases for NV1 (Fig. 3b) or even vanishes\n4\n\n\ffor some centers, such as NV4 (Fig. 3c). This is in contrast to the ensemble\nmeasurements21,22 that showed a maximum in the LAC peak amplitude at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0.\nAccording to the Hamiltonian above, however, spin mixing should vanish at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0. The\npresence of residual spin mixing at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 has been attributed to strain and nuclear\ninteractions23, which vary from center to center.\nThe LAC can be modeled for small values of \u03b8 by considering 0 and \u2212 1 as\npseudo-spin 1/2 states. With preferential population of 0 z , the + 1 level is ignored\nbecause it has a negligible overlap with 0\n\nz\n\n(see Fig. 2c, middle panel). We then have\n\nan effective Hamiltonian H = g\u03bc B (B \u2212 B 0 ) \u22c5 s , where B0 accounts for the zero-field spin\nsplitting and s is the pseudo-spin operator. The Bloch equations for B in the (1 1 0) plane\nare taken to be\nds x\ns\n= \u2212\u03a9 z s y \u2212 x\ndt\nT2\nds y\ndt\n\n= \u03a9 z sx \u2212 \u03a9 x sz \u2212\n\nsy\nT2\n\nds z\ns\n= \u03a9xsy \u2212 z + \u0393\ndt\nT1\nwhere \u0127\u03a9 = g\u03bcB(B-B0), x|| [1 1 2] , y|| [1 1 0] , z||[111]||B0, \u0393 is the rate of optical spin\norientation along z, and T1 and T2 are effective spin relaxation times that depend on \u0393. In\nthis model, the spin relaxation is anisotropic in that T1 and T2 are fixed relative to the\ncrystal axes rather than the magnetic field. The steady-state solution for sz is\nsz =\n\n(\n\n2\n\n2\n\n)\n\nT1\u0393 1 + \u03a9 z T2\n.\n2\n2 2\n1 + \u03a9 x T1T2 + \u03a9 z T2\n\n5\n\n\fWe then take IPL = An0+Bn-1 = A(1/2+sz)+B(1/2-sz), where A and B (n0 and n-1) are the PL\nrates (occupation probabilities) for the 0\n\nz\n\nand \u2212 1\n\nz\n\nlevels, respectively. This simple\n\nmodel describes the experimental data for a wide range of angles and magnetic fields,\nwhere the same fit parameters are used for all angles (Fig. 3b and c lines). The fits yield\nT1 = 64 ns and T2 = 11 ns for NV4 using a laser power of 2.9 mW (Fig. 3c) and T1 = 130\nns and T2 = 23 ns for a power of 890 \u03bcW (not shown). The results indicate that the laser\nintroduces substantial anisotropic spin relaxation via excitation out of the ground state\nmanifold.\nThe 500G peak evolves similarly to the LAC peak but over a broader angular\nrange. It has nearly the same amplitude and width at a given field angle for all N-V\ncenters investigated with suitable orientation. In addition, the peak has been observed in\nall four samples measured. The evolution of the 500G peak with \u03b8 and B can be\nreasonably accounted for in the model by postulating an LAC in the excited state, as is\nexpected to occur at some field due to the presence of zero-field spin splittings12,13,14.\nFigure 3d shows the normalized amplitudes A of the 500G and LAC (1000 G) peaks as a\nfunction of \u03b8. Fits of the model to this data (red lines) and to the field scans (not shown)\nyield T1 = 36 ns and T2 = 1.8 ns for an excited state LAC at ~500 G.\nSimilar data is taken on ensembles of N-V centers in Fig. 4a, where the 500G\npeak is found to reduce in amplitude by ~50% at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0. Additionally, higher resolution\nfield scans around 500 G (Fig. 4a, inset) reveal the characteristic hyperfine quintuplet of\nsubstitutional nitrogen (NS) centers24. These peaks appear when the electron spin\nsplittings of NS and N-V centers are equal, resulting in enhanced cross relaxation via the\nmagnetic dipole interaction25,26,27. Notably, the NS peak amplitudes diminish as |\u03b8|\n\n6\n\n\fincreases, suggesting that the 500G peak is commensurate with a decrease in spin\npolarization, like the LAC peak.\nThe above results indicate the most suitable angular range (|\u03b8| < 1\u00b0) for observing\nthe coupling of a single N-V center to its neighboring NS spins. Figure 4b displays two\nfield scans for NV4 at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 (blue circles) and 1\u00b0 (red circles), showing the increase in\npeak magnitude with decreasing angle, as in the ensemble data. Figure 4c shows similar\ndata for NV1 at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 with powers of 300 \u03bcW (blue circles) and 890 \u03bcW (red circles).\nThe nitrogen lines broaden and decrease in relative amplitude at higher power, which\nmay result from ionization of the NS centers28. The difference in the depth of the NS\npeaks between NV4 and NV1 is suggestive of variation in the local nitrogen\nconcentration.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that the NS centers are \"dark\" in that they are not directly\ndetected by photoluminescence. By measuring a single N-V center, the number of NS\nspins that can be probed is decreased by orders of magnitude relative to ensemble\nmeasurements. Furthermore, this dark-spin spectroscopy technique is in principle\napplicable to a variety of paramagnetic defects in diamond. With higher purity samples29\nand single ion implantation30, these results could make possible the long-range coupling\nof two individually addressable N-V centers connected by a chain of dark spins, enabling\nexperimental tests of spin lattice theories and quantum information processing schemes.\n\n7\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe thank O. Gywat for valuable discussions and G. C. Farlow for high energy electron\nirradiation of several samples. This work was supported by AFOSR, DARPA/MARCO,\nand ARO.\n\nMethods\nSample preparation and characterization\nThe samples are commercially available high-temperature high-pressure diamond\n(Sumitomo) with nominal dimensions of 1.4\u00d71.4\u00d71.0 mm and nitrogen concentrations of\n100-1000 ppm, measured by UV absorption31. N-V centers naturally exist in these\nsamples with estimated densities ranging from 1010 to 1013 cm-3. Two parallel sample\nfaces are polished and have (100) orientation. For ensemble measurements, samples are\nirradiated with 1.7 MeV electrons with a dose of 5\u00d71017 cm-3 and subsequently annealed\nat 900oC for 2 hours to increase the N-V center concentration6.\nExperimental techniques\nThe measurement apparatus is based around a confocal microscope with a\nHanbury Brown and Twiss detection scheme18. A diode-pumped solid state laser emitting\nat 532 nm is linearly polarized and focused onto the sample with a microscope objective\nof numerical aperture 0.73 and working distance 4.7 mm. The linear polarization is set to\nany desired angle by changing the retardance of a variable wave plate (fast axis at 45o to\nthe initially vertical polarization) in front of a quarter-wave plate (fast axis vertical). The\nlaser spot is positioned on the sample in both lateral dimensions with a fast steering\n\n8\n\n\fmirror. The PL from the sample is collected by the same microscope objective, passed\nthrough a dichroic mirror and a 640 nm long-pass filter and sent via a 50/50 beam-splitter\nto two fiber-coupled silicon avalanche photodiode modules. For antibunching\nmeasurements, the outputs of the detectors are connected to a time-correlated single\nphoton counting module. For measurements of N-V center ensembles, PL is detected\nwith a photodiode and lock-in amplifier. In general, the PL is used as a feedback signal to\ncompensate for thermal drift, enabling a single N-V center to be tracked for several days.\nThe samples are at room temperature for all measurements discussed in this Letter.\nThe static magnetic field B is applied to the sample with a permanent magnet\nmounted on a multi-axis stage that allows the distance between the magnet and the\nsample to be adjusted by a stepper motor, thereby setting |B| at the sample. In addition,\nthe polar and azimuthal angles of B are manually adjustable with micrometers while\nkeeping |B| constant at the sample to better than 1%. For ESR measurements, a 25 \u03bcm\ndiameter gold wire is connected to a microwave signal generator (with 16 dBm power\noutput) and placed in close proximity (~50 \u03bcm) to the laser spot.\nPolarization anisotropy calculation\nAccording to Fermi's golden rule in the electric dipole approximation, the\nabsorption rate is proportional to |D*E|2, where D is the dipole matrix element and E is\nthe excitation electric field vector. The absorption anisotropy is estimated as\n|Y*V|2/|X*H|2, where X and Y are the dipoles (see Fig. 2a) and V|| [1 1 0] and H||[110] are\npolarization vectors. A more accurate calculation would account for the dipole radiation\npattern, the large numerical aperture of the microscope objective and refractive effects\n\n9\n\n\fdue to the diamond air boundary. However, the simple equation above is sufficient to\naccount for both the anisotropy orientations and degeneracies that are measured.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n1\n\nGruber, A. et al.
