In single crystal Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 below approximately 25 K, \u03bb(T, H, j) is strongly\nhysteretic. We propose that the irreversibility arises from a shift of the vortex position within its\npinning well as j changes.

The second\nmagnetization peak disappears and the critical current\nincreases sharply. The Larkin pinning length [8] becomes comparable to the interplanar spacing implying\nthat vortex pancakes are pinned individually (0 \u2212 D pinning) rather than as components of an elastic string. In\nthis region the ac susceptibility measured in a zero-field\ncooled (ZFC) sample differs markedly from that obtained\nin a field cooled (FC) sample [5]. ZFC samples represent a nonequilibrium flux profile and the small signal\nresponse of such a system is not fully understood [9, 10].\nIn this paper we report measurements of the penetration\ndepth in both FC and ZFC samples. Our measurements\nshow strong hysteresis and memory effects but are not\nin the limit of strong driving fields where the ac field\nitself can induce new vortex phases [11]. We propose\nthat the hysteretic ZFC response can be understood as\na generalized Campbell penetration depth \u03bbC (B, T, j)\nthat depends upon the slowly relaxing supercurrent j\nas well as the curvature of the pinning potential as parameterized by jc . We compare data in Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8\n(BSCCO, Tc \u223c 92 K) to measurements in electron-doped\nPr1.85 Ce0.15 CuO4 (PCCO, Tc \u223c 24 K), an organic superconductor \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 (ET)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 (\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 -ET, Tc \u223c 5\nK) [12] and N b (Tc \u223c 9.3 K). The penetration depth\nwas measured with an 11 M Hz tunnel-diode driven LC\nresonator [13, 14] mounted in a 3 He refrigerator. An\nexternal dc magnetic field (0 \u2212 7 kOe) was applied parallel to the ac field (\u223c 5 mOe). The oscillator frequency\nshift \u2206f = f (T ) \u2212 f (Tmin ) is proportional to the ac susceptibility and, therefore, to the change in penetration\ndepth, \u2206\u03bb = \u03bb(B, T ) \u2212 \u03bb(B, Tmin ) via \u2206f = \u2212G\u2206\u03bb,\nwhere G is a calibration constant [13, 14]. For an ac\nmagnetic field along the c-axis, only ab-plane rf screening currents are excited. Although this results in a much\nsmaller ac Lorentz force on vortices, it removes complica-\n\nj (10\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0211047v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 3 Nov 2002\n\n1\n\n0\n3\n0\n\n0.0\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 1: Experiment 1: BSCCO crystal ZFC to 1.5 K and\nHdc = 260 Oe applied.

Right axis shows current\ndensity estimated from the irreversible magnetization.\n\ntions from interplane currents. The absence of c-axis currents is demonstrated by the zero field data in BSCCO.\nWe obtain a linear change d\u03bbL /dT \u2248 11 \u00c5/K in good\nagreement with earlier measurements and indicative of\na d\u2212wave superconductor [15, 16, 17]. Any significant\ntilt of the ac field would generate c-axis currents and\ngive a much larger value of d\u03bbL /dT . The total penetration depth in the mixed state is \u03bb2 = \u03bb2L + \u03bb2vortex\nwhere \u03bbL is the London penetration depth and \u03bbvortex\nthe contribution from vortex motion. A comprehensive\nexpression for \u03bbvortex has been derived by several authors [21, 22, 23]. At low temperatures and frequencies well below the pinning frequency (of order GHz in\ncuprates), \u03bbvortex reduces to the Campbell pinning penetration depth \u03bb2C = \u03c60 B/4\u03c0\u03b1 [19]. Here \u03c60 is the flux\nquantum and \u03b1 is the Labusch parameter [20].

This value is well within the\nrange of individual pinning wells (of order a coherence\nlength or more), justifying our assumption of small oscillations. Fig. 1 presents \u03bb(B, T ) for a BSCCO single\ncrystal as the temperature was cycled. After zero field\ncooling (ZFC) to 1.5 K, the dc field was ramped from\n\n0 \u2192 \u22127 kOe \u2192 260 Oe. This procedure ensured that\nthe entire sample was filled with vortices, but nonuniformly. The sample was then warmed (1 \u2192 2) during\nwhich \u03bb first decreased then increased again. (Neglecting the initial ramp to \u22127 kOe yields nearly the same\ncurve but with a weak maximum near 2 K which may\ncome from portions of the sample where no vortices exist\nand thus screen more efficiently). During this phase of\nthe cycle j relaxes as the flux distribution becomes more\nuniform. On the same plot we show the screening current j measured on the same sample, in the same field in\na SQUID magnetometer. j was determined from the irreversible component of magnetization and applying the\nBean model. j measured in this way is considerably different from jc owing to strong flux creep in the cuprates.\nOnce the temperature exceeds Tirr \u223c 25\u221230 K, j relaxes\nmore rapidly and the flux profile becomes uniform. Subsequent cooling and warming traces (2 \u2192 3 \u2192 2) were\nperfectly reversible and represent the penetration depth\nof a uniform flux profile. This reversible curve was identical to that obtained in a field-cooled (FC) experiment\nand we refer to them interchangeably. The hysteresis between points 1 and 3 in Fig. 1 corresponds to a change\nin rf magnetization of \u2264 10\u22127 emu, which is at the detectability limit of commercial magnetometers.\nIn Fig. 2 we show similar measurements in the electrondoped cuprate PCCO (\u03b3 = 30\u221280), an organic superconductor \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 -ET (\u03b3 = 400 \u2212 800) [18], and polycrystalline\nN b (\u03b3 = 1). Together with BSCCO (\u03b3 = 300 \u2212 400),\nthese materials span a wide range in transition temperature and anisotropy \u03b3. All three anisotropic superconductors show nonmonotonic ZFC temperature dependence, represented by the top curve in each panel. By\ncontrast, in Nb and in YBCO (also measured but not\nshown, \u03b3 = 6 \u2212 8) \u03bb(ZF C) always increases monotonically with temperature. Returning to Fig. 1, although\nthe pinning changes dramatically near 25 K, the change\nin the penetration depth is observable only in the ZFC\ncurve. The FC curve is perfectly smooth. Goffman et al.\n[3] reported measurements of the transverse susceptibility (ac field along the ab - plane) at very low frequencies\nthat did show a sharp increase in screening below 22 K.\nThis feature disappeared at kHz frequencies [3], which is\nconsistent with our data at 11 MHz. We now focus on\nthe ZFC behavior. Fig. 3 shows the time dependence of\nvarious quantities. The topmost curve shows \u03bb when the\nsample field was cooled to 2 K in Hdc = 500 Oe. Relaxation is negligible. When the sample was zero-field\ncooled and then 500 Oe applied, \u03bb and j showed logarithmic relaxation. This correspondence suggests that in\na ZFC state, the penetration depth should have a direct\nfunctional relationship to j. This is confirmed in Fig. 4\nwhere we compare \u03bb measured at the same final value\nof field but with two entirely different flux profiles. The\nsolid symbols correspond to the initial application (at\n1.5 K) of a \u22127 kOe magnetizing field, as before, while\n\n\f3\n1.3\n0\n\n1000\n\nT = 2 K\n\nZFC+500 Oe\n(t) = - 31 ln(1+t)\n\n-100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n0\n\ntime (s)\n\nFIG. 3: Time-logarithmic relaxation of the ac penetration\ndepth after application of a 500 Oe magnetic field at 2 K\n(lower curve) and after FC in 500 Oe (upper curve). Right\naxis refers to the relaxation of the current j obtained from\nthe magnetization measurements.\n\nthe open symbols correspond to a +7 kOe magnetizing\nfield. Both fields were then returned to H = +260 Oe before the temperature sweep began. The distribution of B\nthroughout the sample was entirely different for these two\nstarting conditions, as shown schematically. However,\nwithin a critical state picture, the magnitude of dB/dx\nand thus j remains the same for these two distributions.\nThe fact that \u03bb vs. T was unchanged for the two starting conditions is strong evidence that j and not B is the\ndeterminant of the penetration depth in the nonuniform\nstate. Some implicit dependence of the Labusch constant\nupon B could account for minor differences between the\ncurves at higher temperatures. Based on these results,\nwe propose the following model for \u03bbC (B, T, j) in a superconductor with a non-uniform flux profile. The supercurrent j biases vortices away from equilibrium through\nthe Lorentz force, FL = j \u00d7 \u03c60 /c. The Campbell depth\nis then determined by the curvature of the pinning potential well at the biased position. For a pinning potential, V (r), the vortex displacement, r0 , is found from\ndV /dr = FL . The maximum force determines the critical\ncurrent, jc = c\u03b10 rp /\u03c60 , attained at the range of the pinning potential rp . The effective Labusch constant \u03b1 (j) is\nthen determined from \u03b1 (j) = d2 V /dr2 r=r0 . For example, consider the form V (x) = \u03b10 (T )x2 (1 \u2212 x/3) /2, for\nwhich the volume pinning force saturates. Here x = r/rp\nis a dimensionless vortex displacement. This potential\nhas been used to analyze the quantum tunneling of vortices [24]. The supercurrent\np j biases the vortex segment\nto a new position x0p\n= 1\u2212 1 \u2212 j/jc where the local curvature is \u03b1(j) = \u03b10 1 \u2212 j/jc .

Schematics shows the corresponding profiles of vortex density.\n\nThe model predicts that \u03bbC (ZF C) > \u03bbC (F C) since j =\n0 in the FC case. This conclusion remains true for other\n\u0001\npinning potentials such as V (x) = \u03b10 x2 1 \u2212 x2 /6 /2\n[25]. As Fig. 2 shows, \u03bbC (ZF C) > \u03bbC (F C) in all materials studied. The model also predicts that j/jc , and not\nB explicitly, determines the nonequilibrium component\nof the penetration depth, as shown in Fig. 4. Rodriguez\net al. [5] have previously reported a difference in the ac\nsusceptiblity between FC and ZFC samples of BSCCO.\nTheir data look similar to ours, although they observed\nhysteresis only when the ac field was parallel to the conducting planes, inducing both ab-plane and c-axis currents. They also worked at considerably larger ac field\namplitudes. They attributed the nonmonotonic ZFC\ncurve to a c-axis critical current that was non-monotonic\nwith temperature in the critical state. This effect presumably occurs only in highly anisotropic materials like\nBSCCO. We found nonmonotonic ZFC curves only in\nthe highly anisotropic materials studied (BSCCO, PCCO\nand \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 -ET) so two dimensionality clearly is important as\nthose authors emphasize. However, our model involves no\nc-axis currents and shows that the current biasing effect\npredicts \u03bbC (ZF C) > \u03bbC (F C) as observed. The precise\nshape of the ZFC curve depends upon how rapidly j relaxes during the sweep and the thermal history of the\nsample, so it is not a basic property of the superconductor. For example, in Fig. 1, if we ZFC only to 12 K\ninstead of 1.5 K, the maximum in \u03bb occurs at point 4, i.e.,\nthe lowest temperature achieved on the initial cooldown.\nWe then trace the path 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 3. Despite\nbeing in a nonequilibrium state, the system retains perfect memory in its passage from point 4 to 5 and back to\n\n\f4\nDOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences, under contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38.\n\n3.0\n\n~ 1\n\nj\n\njc\n\n2.0\n\n~\n\nj jc\n\nC\n\n(j)/\n\nC\n\n(j=0)\n\n2.5\n\n14\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nj/j\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nC\n\nFIG. 5: Experimentally determined \u03bbC (j/jc ) /\u03bbC (0) for\nBSCCO single crystal\n\n4.\nIn principle the j/jc dependence of \u03bbC (B, T, j) allows one to determine the shape of the pinning potential. With \u03bbL (0) \u2248 2690 \u00c5, determined from our earlier measurements [17] we obtain total penetration depth\n\u03bbC (B, T, j). Fig. 5 shows \u03bbC (j/jc ) for BSCCO taken\nfrom data points at different temperatures and thus different values of j/jc . jc is obtained from force balance,\n4\u03c0jc /c = Brp /\u03bb2C (0) with rp = 30 \u00c5 where \u03bbC (j = 0)\nis obtained from the FC data. Up to j/jc = 0.2 the data\nfits Eq.(1) rather well, but at higher p\nvalues of j/jc the\ndependence is much weaker, closer to j/jc . The larger\nvalues of j/jc correspond to lower temperature points,\ndeep inside the 0D pinning region. There is no explicit\nform for the pinning potential is this glassy phase and in\nfact this experiment may be the first\np attempt to measure\nit. Interestingly, the observed j/jc behavior follows\nfrom a nonanalytic pinning potential V (x) \u221d x3/2 but\nwe have no theoretical justification for this form. In conclusion, we propose a current biasing effect to explain\nthe difference between FC and ZFC measurements of the\nCampbell penetration depth in a variety of superconductors. The supercurrent j biases vortices to a new position in the pinning potential and the Campbell depth\nmeasures the local curvature, which depends upon j/jc .\nThis effect may be used to probe the shape of the vortex\npinning potential.\nAcknowledgements:\nWe thank V.
