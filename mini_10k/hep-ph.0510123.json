Introduction\nThe idea that QGP at RHIC, T = (1 \u2212 2)Tc , seems to be in a strongly coupled regime\n(sQGP) was introduced in 2003 [ 1, 2, 3] and was discussed a lot at the \"discovery\" BNL\nworkshop [ 4] and QM04. Let me start with the simplest physics point possible. Although\nat T > Tc quarks are deconfined, the energy needed for separation of quarks close to Tc\nis huge (see Fig.1a, up to U \u223c 4 GeV . One implication is simple: the charges simply\ncannot get separated until very high T . The second: as the ratio U/T \u223c 10 goes into the\nBoltzmann exponents, any perturbative approach is completely hopeless.\nInstead of going to many other arguments, let me simply list main reasons which demand such a radical change, from traditional weak coupling to strong coupling methods:\n1.Collective phenomena observed at RHIC lead the hydro practitioners to view QGP as\na \"near perfect liquid\" [ 1, 6];\n2.Feshbach-type resonances due to marginal states may lead to large cross sections [ 2].\n3.Classical e/m plasma can be a good liquid too, if sufficiently strongly coupled.\n4. A close relative of QCD, the N =4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory can be\nstudied in a strongly coupled g 2 Nc \u2192 \u221e regime at finite T via the AdS/CFT correspondence: the results are very close to what we observe at RHIC.\nSince I cannot cover all these topics in depth, let me just provide a more detailed list\nof these arguments, with at least some statements and references:\n(1a) The departure of elliptic flow data from the hydro prediction happens only at rather\nhigh pt \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2 GeV , from which the estimated viscosity-to-entropy ratio \u03b7/s = .1 \u2212 .2\n[ 6] is more than order of magnitude lower than in pQCD.\n(1b) Another transport coefficient, the charm diffusion constant Dc deduced from single\nelectron RAA and v2 (much discussed at this meeting), is also an order of magnitude lower\nthan pQCD estimates [ 7].\n\n\f2\n\nE.Shuryak\n5\n\n0\n\n4\n\n\u0015 \u001b \u001c\n\u0014 \u001a\n\u0011 \u0012 \u0013 \u0019\n\u0018\n\u0017 \u0007 \b\n\u0016 \u0006\n\u0005\n\n\u000e \u000f \u0010\n!\n\n\"\n\n# $\n\n3\n\n\u001f\n\nEb Tc\n\nU(T,r->infty) (GeV)\n\n2\n\n\u0004 \u00024\n\u001e\n\n2\n\n%\n&\n'\n(\n\n\u00036\n1\n\n0\n\nmeson bound states\ndiquark bound states\nbaryon bound states\n3)gluon bound states\n\n\u001d\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nT/Tc\n\n1.6\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\n1.75\n\nT \u0001 Tc\n\n2\n\n2.25\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 1. (a) The separation energy U(T, r \u2192 \u221e) \u2212 U(T, r = .2f m) in GeV vs T /Tc ,\ncalculated from the free energy [ 5] by removing the entropy term.(b) Dependence of\nvarious states' binding energy (in units of Tc ) on the temperature.\n\n(1c) New hydrodynamical phenomenon suggested recently [ 8], the conical flow, maybe\nexplains why secondaries from a quenched jet fly preferentially to large angle \u2248 70 degrees\nconsistent with the Mach angle for (time-averaged) speed of sound.\n(2a) Combining lattice data on quasiparticle masses and interparticle potentials, one indeed finds a lot of bound states [ 9] and resonances [ 10] at T > T c\n(2b) The same approach explains why \u03b7c , J/\u03c8 remains bound till near 3Tc , as was directly\nobserved on the lattice [ 11];\n(2c) this approach was experimentally demonstrated to work for ultra-cold trapped\nfermionic atoms Li6 , turning it to near prefect liquid as well when the Feshbach resonance leads to the scattering length a \u2192 \u221e. Experiments on oscillations found a sharp\nminimum in damping near the resonance, reducing it by about 2 orders of magnitude.\nAccording to our study [ 12] two lowest modes are well described by hydro with \"quantum\nviscosity\" \u03b7 \u2248 0.3h\u0304n, in a way nearly as low as that of sQGP.\n(2d) Heavy-light resonances in sQGP can explain the value of the charm diffusion constant [ 13].\n(3a) The interaction parameter \u0393 =< potential energy > /T in sQGP is obviously not\nsmall, O(10). At such \u0393 the classical strongly coupled e/m plasma is a good liquid: we\nfind the same in our classical version of sQGP as well;\n(4a) The EoS for finite T N =4 SUSY YM is similar to what is seen on the lattice in the\nRHIC domain, namely p/pideal = [(3/4) + O((g 2Nc )\u22123/2 )] [ 14];\n(4b)At infinite coupling there is a finite limit of viscosity \u03b7/s => 1/4\u03c0 [ 15], again close\nto the RHIC value. The \"R-charge\" diffusion constant is low as well.\n(4c) One may even think about AdS/CFT \"gravity dual\" to the whole RHIC collisions,\nwith black hole production [ 16] which then fly away from the test brane [ 17].\n\n\fsQGP\n\n3\n\n2. Systematics of collective flows\n2.1. Elliptic flows\nCollective flows observed at SPS and RHIC are quite accurately reproduced by ideal\nhydrodynamics for the QGP/mixed phase, complemented by a hadronic cascade for the\nhadronic phase [ 19]. The radial flow predictions are in quantitative agreement with the\ndata for all secondaries, from \u03c0 to \u03a9\u2212 . Elliptic flow is described by v2 =< cos(2\u03c6) >\ndepending on 6 variables v2 (s, pt, Mi , y, b, A), the energy, transverse momentum, particle\nmass, rapidity, centrality and system size. Hydro works for not-too-large pt < 2GeV\n(above it a different and still poorly understood regime starts.)\n(i) The energy dependence was the issue I discussed already at QM99[ 18], v2 (s) was\npredicted to be smoothly rising from SPS to RHIC by about factor 2, as stiffer EoS of\nthe QGP replaces that of hadronic gas and mixed phase, see more in [ 19]. It was soon\nconfirmed by the first RHIC data1 .\n(ii) the (pseudo)rapidity dependence v2 (\u03b7) has a triangular shape (PHOBOS). Although\nthe first 3-d hydro by Hirano et al were not able to reproduce it, now with a hydro+cascade\napproach [ 20] it works well. The physics is basically the same as for v2 (s): in fact v2 displays good \"limiting fragmentation\", it depends mostly on local density v2 (dN/dy(s, y))\nrather than on s and y by itself.\n(iii) The v2 (pt , Mi ) dependence for different species, known as the \"fine structure\" of\nthe elliptic flow, was discussed here by R.Lacey [ 21] who pointed out a scaling relation\nv2 \u223c Mi yt2 where yt is the transverse rapidity. Suggested by hydro, it is perfectly satisfied\nby the data for all secondaries.\n(iv) Centrality and size dependence: ideal hydro is scale invariant and v2 is basically\ngiven by the spatial deformation, thus v2 (b, A)/\u01eb2 (b, A) \u2248 const(b, A). This relation is in\nexcellent agreement with the data.\nRemaining hydro-skeptics include Bhalerao et al [ 22], who ascribe the rise in v2 (s) (or\nthat in v2 (\u03b7) toward midrapidity) to an \"incomplete equilibration\". It was pointed out\nearlier by H.Heselberg et al [ 23] that hydro scaling (iv) should be violated for sufficiently\nperipheral collisions, by a \"dilute regime\". Unfortunately, due to experimental difficulties\nthat regime was never really clearly observed. Bhalerao et al pointed out possible dependence on the system size, predicting violation of hydro scaling v2 (CuCu)/v2 (AuAu) \u223c 1/3.\nRecent CuCu data do not agree with them while the hydro scaling is still satisfied.\nAn overall blue sky still has two clouds: (i) v4 /v22 seem to be a constant, but not .5\nas ideal hydro predicts, but about 1.2. It may be related to the issue of v2 fluctuations\ndiscussed by Mrowczynski and myself [ 24].). (ii) the HBT radii remain a puzzle. Paradoxically. we can better describe early stages (when the elliptic flow is formed) than very\nlate dilute ones. It may well be that our freezeout conditions via naive cascades are no\ngood: effective potentials, resonances etc may be different than we thought2 .\n1\n\nHydro with fixed freezeout, at Tf , lead to a non-monotonous curve which is not the case.\nOne recent attempt, by Cramer and G.Miller, has generated discussion here. I complained that they do\nnot account for the pions absorbed by their optical potential on the way out. B.Muller, in a summary,\ndefended them because \"the source term in the HBT formalism describes the vertex position of the last\ninelastic interaction\". As the author of that formalism (in 1973) I cannot agree more: thus Cramer and\nMiller better follow their pions to that last interaction.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nE.Shuryak\n\n2.2. Conical flow\nLet me start reminding a general kinematics of the most elementary process 1 => 2,\npossible for a jet in matter. No change in the mass implies 0 = (p\u2212k)2 \u2212p2 = \u22122(pk)+k 2 .\nProvided the last small term (recoil) can be dropped, the angle between ~k and p~ is then\ncos(\u03b8) = (k0 p0 /kp), For very fast particle p0 /p = 1 and thus the condition for the process\nis simply k0 < k.\nNow, the RHIC data on 2-particle correlation with a triggered jet show that most\nradiation goes into a peak at angles 60-70 degrees, so that cos(\u03b8) \u2248 1/3 and thus that\nmust be the k0 /k ratio for what is emitted. This fits very well to sound waves, for which\nthis ratio is the speed of sound cs , and its average value over the duration of the collision\nis indeed about3 1/3. One simple way to test that was suggested by Antinori and myself\n[ 25]: if the jet is a b quark (which can be tagged experimentally) p0 /p = 1/v > 1 which\ncauses the cone to shrink, till it goes to zero at the critical velocity v = cs . Gluon radiation\nbehaves in the opposite way with decreasing v, and never shrinks to zero.\nA number of people suggested a possibility of gluon\nCherenkov\nradiation, see the talk by Ruppert for de(b)\nT=Tc\n(a)\ntails. There is very little support in data or theory\nT<Tc\nfor that: but even the optimists find the angles for\nCherenkov emission of gluons with p \u223c 1 GeV to be\nat least order of magnitude smaller than the observed\n(c)\nTc<T<1.5Tc\npeak at \u223c 70 degrees.\nWhether the mechanism of dE/dx is a gluon radiT > 3Tc\nation or scattering or ionization, a small mean free\npath implies rapid local deposition of energy, with\nsubsequent hydrodynamical process. This issue is\n(d)\ndiscussed in detail in the talk of my collaborator\nCasalderrey-Solana [ 8]: The observed shape of the\nFigure 2: Schematic picture of peak, its magnitude and pt dependence is in rough\nmatter, as the temperature grows agreement with the data. The issue of flow subtraction seem to be resolved (see B.Cole's talk), but 3particle correlations are still too controversial to comment. Let me only remind that our hydro solutions\nare obtained with arbitrary viscosity, and that the observed effects already constrain the\nviscosity more than all data on v2 since the gradients are larger for conical than for elliptic\nflow.\n3. First quantum manybody states above Tc\nThe existence of bound states of quark and gluon quasiparticles at T > Tc , suggested\nin [ 2] was much discussed at this meeting. Let me first report on recent studies [ 26],\ndone in collaboration with grad.student J.F.Liao.\nOne result is about polymeric chains of the type q\u0304gg..gq which appear naturally in a\nstring picture4 . For this problem the most useful coordinates in this case are not the usual\n3\n4\n\nNote, we don't mean here speed of sound squared!\nRecall that a gluon has two color indices and can thus be connected to two strings.\n\n\f5\n\nsQGP\n\nJacobi but \"chain coordinates\", using which we have proven that such polymers have the\nsame binding energy per bond5 as for q\u0304q mesons. We also studied (variationally) two\n3-body problems: the closed (3-)chains of gluons (ggg) and (qqq) baryons. Their binding\nenergy (and range) is shown in Fig.1: one can see that the former one is quite robust\nwhile baryons have quite marginal binding (because of smaller relative charge of quarks).\nBefore we go forward with a general discussion, let us try to summarize the proposed\nscenario as a single picture, see Fig.1(b). From relatively short string-like configuration\nof color fields at low T , fig (a), one moves to longer strings (b) at the critical point [ 28].\nNew is picture (c) which depicts \"polymeric chains\" considered in this work, significant\nat T = (1 \u2212 1.5)Tc . Eventually, at high T , one goes into (d) with independent quark and\ngluon quasiparticles, neutralized by isotropic Debye clouds.\nLet me now briefly touch on criticism of the\n\"bound state QGP\" raised at this meeting. First,\nlet us be clear what is being criticized. The bound\nstates are not ad hoc ideas but the direct mathematiall\nq\ncal consequence of: (i) quasiparticle masses from the\nq1g\nq2q\nlattice [ 29]; (ii) lattice-based effective interaction beb\ntween colored charges [ 5]; and (iii) quantum mechanT 0 T\nics. None of the critics ever suggested that either (i)\nor (ii) or (iii) may be wrong. Where the direct test\nall\nhas been made, for the charmonium states [ 11], one\nq\nq.g\nfinds a good agreement. And it does not take much\nq/q\nb\nto realize that quasiparticles with M \u223c 1 GeV should\nbehave like the charmed quarks.\nV.Koch et al [ 30] and F.Karsch[ 31] argued that\nthey do not see a significant contributions of diT- T\nquarks (and baryons) in the lattice data on dn (T ) =\n\u2202 n (p/T 4)/\u2202(\u03bc/T )n |\u03bc=0 with n=2,4,6 at T > 1.2T c.\nIt is hardly surprising, as there are not so many states\nof those and the expected masses are rather large,\nall\n2Mq and 3Mq , respectively 6 . (In [ 9] we have not\nq\nq+g\nq,q\neven included diquarks and baryons in pressure, to\nb\nwhich they clearly contribute too little.) Karsch [\n31] further argued that the ratio d4 /d2 \u2248< B 2 >\nT * T\ngives directly the mean constituent baryon number\nB, and since this ratio gets close to 1 above Tc , all\nFigure 3: The contribution of dif- bound states with B > 1 are excluded. But the same\nferent states to (a) d2 , (b) d4 and reasoning gives d /d \u2248< B 2 > as well: this ratio is\n6\n4\n(c) d6 in a \"bound state\" model, however not close to 1 but \u223c \u221210. Does it exclude\nthe points are data [ 32]\nany quark gas model as well?\nIn fact the argument is simply too naive and ignores a lot of things. What is worse, Karsch et al\n1.5\n\n1.25\n\nd2\n\n1\n\n0.75\n0.5\n\n0.25\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nc\n\n5\n4\n\nd4\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n-1\n-2\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nc\n\n50\n25\n\nd6\n\n0\n\n-25\n-50\n-75\n\n-100\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nc\n\n5\n\nNot per particle, so long enough chains have twice more binding per particle than mesons.\nIn fact all their arguments can be repeated verbatim for say T \u223c 50M eV or so, with the same conclusion:\nno visible baryons in a hadronic gas. They do exist as states there, of course.\n6\n\n\f6\n\nE.Shuryak\n\nhave not explained the most prominent features of his\ndata, the peak in d4 (T ) and the \"wiggle' in d6 (T ). see Fig.3, or large flavor-nondiagonal\nd4 (T ), d6(T ).\nIt was pointed out in ref.[ 34], that since the quasiparticle masses may depend on \u03bc\ntheir derivatives such as M \u2032\u2032 = (\u2202 2 M/\u2202\u03bc2 )|\u03bc=0 must be included in all formulae. The\nsame is true for masses of the bound states such as baryons. It is shown in our paper\n[ 33] that all above mentioned features of higher susceptibilities are naturally explained\nby the expected change in the baryon (N, \u2206) mass MB (T, \u03bc). At the phase boundary\nit is expected to grow from the \"vacuum mass\" \u223c 1GeV to much larger value in sQGP,\n\u2248 3Mq . As a result MB\u2032\u2032 is large and changes sign at the inflection point near Tc : that is\nwhy there is a peak in d4 (T ) and the \"wiggle' in d6 (T ), see the baryon curve b in Fig.3.\n(The effect of binding of qq and qg states is not included in this plot: in the latter case\nit can increase its contribution by factor 2-3 and make a better agreement with data,\nespecially for d2 .)\n4. Strongly coupled colored classical plasma, studied via Molecular Dynamics\nNice introduction to strongly coupled Abelian e/m plasmas has been provided here by\nM.Thoma, so let me jump directly to the point. The interaction parameter is defined as\n\u0393 = Cc \u03b1s n1/3 Ncorr /T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the color Casimir is Cc = 4/3 and 3 for q and g. The quasiparticle density7 is\n1/3\nproportional to large number of degrees of freedom in QGP n1/3 \u223c Ndof T where Ndof =\n16 + 2 \u2217 2 \u2217 3 \u2217 Nf \u223c 50. The number of \"strongly correlated partners\" Ncorr is just 1\nfor binary states, 2 for polymeric chains we discussed above, but goes up to 12 for a fcc\ncrystal (see below). Combining all, even for \u03b1s \u223c 1 one finds \u0393 > 1, possibly up to O(10).\nFurther, the structure is exponentially sensitive to \u0393 as it goes to Boltzmann factor. And,\nas we show below, \u0393 \u223c 10 is precisely where the plasma liquid is most perfect.\nNew model B.Gelman, I.Zahed and myself are proposing [ 35] is based on the following\nmain assumptions: (i) The particles are heavy enough to move non-relativistically, with\nmasses8 M >> T ; (ii) Their interaction is dominated by colored electric (Coulomb) interactions, with all magnetic effects (spin forces, etc) ignored; (iii) Their color representations\nare large, so that color operators ta can be represented by classical vectors.\nDynamics of color vectors as well as particle coordinates are described by classical\nequations of motion (EoM)9 known as Wong equation10 .\nm\n7\n\ndC a\n= gf abc p\u03bc Ab\u03bc C c\nd\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nQuasiparticles inside various bound states should also be included.\nRecall that close to Tc the M/T ratio for quasiparticles reaches 4-5.\n9\nAnother model, amenable to MD simulations, has been proposed at this meeting by the Budapest group\n[ 36]: but the color part is not classical and is subject to complicated stochastic transitions. Not only\ncolor is not conserved in their model, but (as far as i can tell), the energy cannot be conserved either.\n10\nIt can also be rewritten as a set of canonically conjugated equations, for one x-p pair for SU(2) and 3\npairs for SU(3), see [ 27] for refs. B.Muller in summary expressed doubts whether this model is gauge\ninvariant: no reason to worry: it obviously is, this is how Wong derived it.\n\n8\n\n\f7\n\nsQGP\n\nwhere A\u03bc is a local field induced by other particles. The total color and total energy\nare thus conserved (which is monitored during actual MD calculations). The interaction\npotential is proportional to the dot product of the unit color vectors times the potential.\nThe latter eventually should be deduced from lattice simulations, we so far use just a\nCoulomb. In order to stabilize the system, we have also added a short-range repulsion\nwhich is suppose to mimic the quantum-mechanical localization energy Vshort = h\u03042 /Mr 2 ,\nlike it is sometimes done to describe systems like solid He.\nThe main variable parameter of the model is obviously the temperature T . Eventually,\nin applications to sQGP all 4 parameters mentioned above are in fact some functions of\nT , so such applications of the model in the narrow sense would only be restricted to some\n1-d line in a 4-d parameter space. But in order to understand them better it would be\nnecessary first to describe the properties of the model in a wider sense, in all its parameter\nspace.\nThe closest physical e/m analog of our model is the classical two-component ionic\nplasma, e.g. a molten ionic salts11 such as NaCl. For large \u0393 \u2192 \u221e this system\nfreezes into the fcc cubic lattice with alternating positive and negative charges. For\nsmaller 1 < \u0393 < \u0393c \u223c 80 one deals with a strongly coupled ionic liquid. In the nonAbelian case one also expects that the system gets frozen at very large \u0393, with the same\ncubic crystal plus quasi-Abelian ferromagnetic (alternating) order of the color vectors.\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations can follow\nevolution of classical systems, weak or strong coupling. Our studies of that are at exploratory stage\nas of now, done so far with 43 and 63 particles with\nthe SU(2) color vector (a vector on a 3-sphere). In\nthe QM05 talk I have shown some movies of melting\na crystal by \"heating\" a system with a small random\nforce: a bit of friction can cool it back. Even when\npictures look homogeneous and the color vector looks\nisotropic, there are local correlators of neighboring\nparticles at large \u0393.\nFigure 4:\nOur first MD\nOur interest is not so far in detailed studies of its\ndata for the SU(2) classical microscopic structure per se, but in collective explasma: the particle diffusion co- citations \u2013 the phonons and plasmons, as well as\nefficient D and viscosity \u03b7 ver- their widths reflecting transport properties such as\nsus \u0393\u0303 =< |P ot.energy| > / < the (self) diffusion coefficient D and viscosity \u03b7 by\nKin.energy >.\nKubo formulae12 . With increased potential energy\n(or decreased T ) the particle mobility decreases, together with D. But viscosity has a more interesting\ntrend, with a minimum and subsequent rise toward\na \"glassy\" liquid and solid regimes. This happens because the momentum transfer can\nD (diffusion)\neta (viscosity)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n11\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nIt is a good approximation to think an electron to be completely transfered from N a to Cl and T still\nlow enough not to excite other electrons.\n12\nIn fact MD is well suited for such studies, while in lattice QCD the Euclidean time makes it next to\nimpossible to use Kubo-like formulae and access such transport properties.\n\n\f8\n\nE.Shuryak\n\nbe achieved not only by particle propagation but also by phonons/plasmons, which have\nlarge mean free path in perfect solids. Thus an optimum exists, with \"the most perfect\nliquid\": as Fig.4 shows, it is at \u0393 \u223c 10 as well.\n\n5. New views on jet quenching and charm trapping\nThe relevance of substructure of sQGP should be even more important for transport\nproperties. It was first suggested by Zahed and myself in [ 2] that existence of marginal\nstates must increase rescattering and thus dramatically reduce viscosity (mean free paths),\nleading to a collisional (hydrodynamical) regime of expansion. Since different states get\nmarginal at different T , one may hope this mechanism to work at all T up to about 2Tc ,\nthe highest temperature at RHIC.\nWe will now argue that the situation can be different for jet quenching. Its radiative\ntheory tells that all properties of matter come one combination, q\u0302 = 5 \u2212 15 GeV 2 /f m,\nthe values currently under discussion. In most papers this value is expressed as the gluon\ndensity, with dN/dy = 1000 \u2212 3000, and some people argued this may be too large and\ncontradict to entropy produced, see e.g. [ 40]. However the relation between q\u0302 and dN/dy\nassumed is simply invalid in the sQGP regime. (Think of a NaCl-like local structure, with\nalternating charges: the electric field between the ions is a coherent sum of fields from\npositive and negative charges, which increases local fields and q\u0302 compared to randomly\nplaced charges.)\nAnother way to see why jet quenching (and charm equilibration) should be enhanced\nnear Tc is to think about collective momentum/energy sharing in multibody correlated\nclusters we studied above. In particular, an admixture of polymeric chains is known in\nmaterial science to be very effective mechanism of the momentum distribution over larger\nvolume of matter. A famous example is Kevlar fibers added to epoxy (or other plastic),\nnow applied in wide range of applications, from tires, boats etc. to such exotic ones as\n\"bullet-proof vests\" and even \"anti-mine boots\".\nIf this is so, there are consequences which can immediately be checked in experiment.\nIf indeed only a \"well correlated\" (polymerized?) sQGP provides large dE/dx, it should\nonly happen at T rather close to Tc . Since at RHIC the initial temperature is about 2Tc ,\njets may propagate with smaller losses, till the matter cools down and correlates properly.\nSuch a delay would affect the angular distribution of the jet quenching phenomenon for\nnon-central collisions.\nIn fact the original idea of \"jet tomography\" via jet quenching is in serious trouble for\nquite a while, because the most natural assumption \u2013 the energy loss proportional to the\nmatter density \u2013 is in strong contradiction with the observed strong angular dependence\nof jet quenching [ 37], predicting too weak azimuthal asymmetry for non-central collisions.\nIt was however recently pointed out by Pantuev [ 38] that a better description of data can\nbe achieved if the jet quenching at the highest RHIC energy is switched on after some\n\"latent time\" of about 2.2 fm. This time quite reasonably matches a cooling time from\nT \u2248 2Tc to T \u2248 1.5Tc at RHIC.\n\n\fsQGP\n\n9\n\n6. Status of the theory\nStudies of sQGP are developing very rapidly, with many new ideas and connections to\nother fields emerging daily. Instead of a summary, let me comment instead on the rather\ncomplex status of QGP theory in general.\nBefore RHIC there were many approaches which looked reasonable, but then RHIC data\nput it under severe tests. Most of them have not survived, failing to explain collective\nflows, especially the elliptic v2 13 . It took the courage of Gyulassy and Molnar [ 39] to\ntell us that a parton cascade can only get close to the data if the cross sections are huge,\n\u03c3gg \u223c 30mb. But if so, the number of particles interacting at any moment is large and\nthe very concept of a cascade \u2013 free motion interrupted by scattering events \u2013 looses\nits meaning14 . Lattice studies have found very large potentials between colored charges\nnear and above Tc . Now a challenge to all of us is to learn how such a strongly coupled\nsystem of quasiparticles can be organized. The paradigm shift, from wQGP to sQGP, had\ndefinitely occurred. Of course, all these events created a lot of stress in theory circles.\nIs the lesson learned? Well, a lot of people are in denial. Example: in the theory summary B.Muller, after briefly acknowledging a discovery of \"near perfect liquid\", proceeds\nto \"new ideas\" such as a parton cascade with plasma instabilities. This subject, reviewed\nby Mrowczynski, is indeed interesting, and recently numerical studies have shown how\nsuch instability may develop in a quasi-Abelian regime. But now we are approaching\nits moment of truth: its time to do simulation without boxes, with appropriate initial\ndistribution of partons, testing whether the instabilities can indeed lead to a \"little bang\"\nand v2 . I may be wrong, but there are many reasons to think that a collisionless weakly\ncoupled plasma will fail this test. How large gluon masses and potentials seen on the\nlattice can be put into negatives by feeble magnetic effects? How can those explain heavy\ncharm quark stopping/flow, much discussed at this meeting?\nThe situation is well illustrated by a cartoon shown in the summary by B.Muller15 ,\ndisplaying a chicken afraid to cross the street. Yes, crossing from familiar wQGP to the\nsQGP is scary. My advice: don't be a chicken, learn to fly, be an eagle. High above there\nis no fear, and one can see what people do in other fields. And, last but not least, there\nis basically no alternative: one can sell non-working theories only for so long.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
