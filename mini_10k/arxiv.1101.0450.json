One of the easy ways of theoretical realization\nof an inflationary universe is given by popular theories of f (R) gravity whose\nLagrangian is a function f (R) of the scalar curvature R in four space-time dimensions (see refs. [1, 2] for a recent review). The use of those theories in the\ninflationary cosmology was pioneered by Starobinsky [3, 4].\nAn f (R) theory of gravity is classically equivalent to the certain scalar-tensor\ntheory of gravity [5, 6, 7, 8]. In f (R)-gravity a dynamics of the spin-2 part of\nmetric is not modified, but there is the extra propagating scalar field (called\nscalaron) given by the conformal mode of the metric (over Minkowski or (anti)de\nSitter vacuum). That scalar field plays the role of inflaton in the inflationary\nmodels based on f (R) gravity. The f (R) gravity emerged as the phenomenological approach unrelated to any fundamental theory of gravity and without a\nconnection to High-Energy Physics. We believe that such connection may be\nestablished via embedding and extending f (R)-gravity to supergravity, as the\nfirst step. Supergravity is more fundamental than gravity because supergravity\nis the theory of local supersymmetry, while local supersymmetry implies general\ncovariance.\nIn our recent papers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] we proposed the new supergravity\ntheory that we call F (R)-supergravity. It can be considered as the N = 1 locally supersymmetric extension of f (R) gravity. 2 Supergravity is well-motivated\nin High-Energy Physics theory beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Supergravity is also the low-energy effective action of Superstrings that\nis the theory of Quantum Gravity. 3 Unlike the f (R) theories of gravity, the\nF (R) supergravity is more constrained by local supersymmetry and consistency.\nMoreover, the manifestly supersymmetric construction of F (R) supergravity in\nsuperspace [9, 10, 11] leads to a chiral action in curved N = 1 superspace, which\nmay be naturally stable against quantum corrections that are usually given by full\nsuperspace integrals. Our supersymmetric extension of f (R) gravity is non-trivial\nbecause the F (R) supergravity auxiliary fields do not propagate (this feature is\ncalled the auxiliary freedom [16]). Similarly to f (R)-gravity, the (complex) superconformal mode of the supergravity supervielbein (over Minkowski or anti-de\nSitter vacuum) becomes dynamical in F (R) supergravity. As was demonstrated\nin ref. [9], an F (R) supergravity is classically equivalent to the standard N = 1\nPoincar\u00e9 supergravity coupled to the dynamical chiral superfield, whose (nontrivial) K\u00e4hler potential and superpotential are dictated by a chiral (holomorphic) function. The extra dynamical chiral superfield is just the superconformal\n2\n3\n\nAnother (unimodular) F (R) supergravity theory was proposed in ref. [14].\nSome applications of F (R) supergravity to Loop Quantum Gravity were given in ref. [15].\n\n2\n\n\fmode of the supervielbein, or a complex scalaron. As was argued in ref. [9],\nthe leading complex scalar field component of the chiral superfield (the superscalaron) may be identified with the dilaton-axion field in (non-perturbative)\nSuperstrings/M-Theory.\nThe component structure of F (R) supergravity is very complicated, and some\nof its general features were studied in refs. [11, 12]. In particular, the first explicit\nderivation of a real bosonic function f (R) out of the supergravity (holomorphic)\nfunction F (R) was given in ref. [12]. In ref. [13] the natural embedding of the\n(R + R2 )-inflationary model into F (R) supergravity was found, which gives a\nsimple and viable realization of chaotic inflation [17] in supergravity. In this\npaper we further extend the results of ref. [12] to the case of F -function given by\na generic quadratic polynomial in terms of the scalar supercurvature, and analyze\nall possible solutions to the corresponding bosonic f (R)-gravity functions. We\nalso apply the stability requirements to select those of them which are physical.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In sec. 2 we briefly recall the superspace\nconstruction of F (R) supergravity, and provide the algebraic equations for the\nauxiliary fields. In sec. 3 we define our model of F (R) supergravity, and explicitly\nderive the corresponding bosonic functions f (R). The stability conditions are\napplied in sect. 4. Possible physical applications are discussed in sec. 5. Our\nconclusion and outlook is sec. 6.\n\n2\n\nF (R) supergravity and its auxiliary scalars\n\nA concise and manifestly supersymmetric description of supergravity is given\nby superspace. We refer the interested reader to the textbooks [18, 19, 20] for\n\u22121\ndetails. Here we use the units c = ~ = 1 and \u03ba = MPl\nin terms of the (reduced)\nPlanck mass MPl , with the spacetime signature (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212). Our basic notation\nof General Relativity coincides with that of ref. [21].\nThe most succinct formulation of F (R) supergravity exist in a chiral 4D,\nN = 1 superspace where it is defined by the action [9]\nZ\nS = d4 xd2 \u03b8 EF (R) + H.c.\n(1)\nin terms of a holomorphic function F (R) of the covariantly-chiral scalar curvature\nsuperfield R, and the chiral superspace density E. The chiral N = 1 superfield\nR has the scalar curvature R as the field coefficient at its \u03b82 -term. The chiral\nsuperspace density E (in a WZ gauge) reads\n\u0001\n(2)\nE = e 1 \u2212 2i\u03b8\u03c3a \u03c8\u0304 a + \u03b82 B\n\n\u221a\nwhere e = \u2212g, \u03c8 a is gravitino, and B = S \u2212 iP is the complex scalar auxiliary\nfield (it does not propagate in the theory (1) despite of the apparent presence of\n3\n\n\fthe higher derivatives). The theory (1) is classically equivalent to the standard\nN = 1 Poincar\u00e9 supergravity minimally coupled to the chiral scalar superfield, via\nthe supersymmetric Legendre-Weyl-K\u00e4hler transform [9, 10]. The chiral scalar\nsuperfield, given by the superconformal mode of the supervielbein, becomes dynamical in a generic F (R) supergravity.\nAs regards a large-scale evolution of the FRLW Universe in terms of its scale\nfactor, it is the scalar curvature dependence of any gravitational effective action\nthat plays the most relevant role there. Similarly, as regards any supergravitational effective action, the evolution of the FRLW scale factor is largely determined by a dependence of the gravitational superfield effective action upon the\nscalar supercurvature R.\nA bosonic f (R) gravity action is given by [1, 2]\nZ\n\u221a\n(3)\nSf = d4 x \u2212g f (R)\nin terms of the real function f (R) of the scalar curvature R. The relation between the master chiral superfield function F (R) in eq. (1) and the corresponding\nbosonic function f (R) in eq. (3) can be established by appplying the standard\nformulae of superspace [18, 19, 20] and ignoring the fermionic contributions. As\na result [10, 11, 12], one gets a bosonic Lagrangian in the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(\u2212g)\u22121/2 Lbos \u2261 f (R, R\u0303; X, X\u0304) = F \u2032 (X\u0304) 13 R\u2217 + 4X\u0304X + 3XF (X\u0304) + H.c. (4)\n\nwhere the primes denote differentiation, and we have also introduced the notation\nX=\n\n\u03ba\nB\n3\n\nand\n\nR\u2217 = R \u2212 2i \u03b5abcd Rabcd \u2261 R + iR\u0303 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe R\u0303 does not vanish in F (R) supergravity, and it represents an axion, the\npseudo-scalar superpartner of real scalaron (inflaton) in our construction [9, 10,\n11, 12, 13].\nVarying eq. (4) with respect to the complex auxiliary fields X and X\u0304,\n\u2202Lbos\n\u2202Lbos\n=\n=0 ,\n\u2202X\n\u2202 X\u0304\n\n(6)\n\ngives rise to the algebraic equations on the auxiliary fields,\n3F\u0304 + X(4F\u0304 \u2032 + 7F \u2032 ) + 4X\u0304XF \u2032\u2032 + 31 F \u2032\u2032 R\u2217 = 0\n\n(7)\n\n3F + X\u0304(4F \u2032 + 7F\u0304 \u2032 ) + 4X\u0304X F\u0304 \u2032\u2032 + 31 F\u0304 \u2032\u2032 R\u0304\u2217 = 0\n\n(8)\n\nand its conjugate\n\nwhere F = F (X) and F\u0304 = F\u0304 (X\u0304). The algebraic equations (7) and (8) cannot be\nexplicitly solved for X in a generic F (R) supergravity.\n4\n\n\fThe stability conditions in f (R)-gravity are well known [1, 2], and in our\nnotation they read\nf \u2032 (R) < 0\n(9)\nand\nf \u2032\u2032 (R) > 0\n\n(10)\n\nThe first (classical stability) condition (9) is related to the sign factor in front of\nthe Einstein-Hilbert term (linear in R) in the f (R)-gravity action, and it ensures\nthat graviton is not a ghost. The second (quantum stability) condition (10)\nensures that scalaron is not a tachyon.\nBeing interested in the bosonic f (R)-gravity action that follows from eq. (1),\nwe set both gravitino and axion to zero, which also implies R\u2217 = R and a real X.\nIn F (R) supergravity, eq. (9) is to be replaced by a stronger condition [13],\nF \u2032 (X) < 0\n\n(11)\n\nIt is easy to verify that eq. (9) follows from eq. (11) because of eq. (6). Equation\n(11) also guarantees the classical stability of the bosonic f (R) gravity embedding\ninto the full F (R) supergravity against small fluctuations of the axion field [13].\n\n3\n\nOur toy-model\n\nFirst, we recall that the standard (pure) supergravity [18, 19, 20] is reproduced\nin our approach by simply taking\nF \u2032\u2032 = 0\n\n1\nF (R) = f0 \u2212 f1 R ,\n2\n\nor, equivalently,\n\n(12)\n\nwith some (complex) constants f0 and f1 , where Ref1 > 0. Then eqs. (7) and (8)\nare easily solved by\n3f0\n(13)\nX=\n5(Ref1 )\nSubstituting this solution back into the Lagrangian (4) yields\n(\u2212g)\u22121/2 Lbos = \u2212 31 (Ref1 )R +\n\n1 2\n9 |f0 |2\n\u2261 \u2212 MPl\nR\u2212\u039b\n5(Ref1 )\n2\n\n(14)\n\n\u22129 |f0 |2\n\u22126 |f0 |2\n=\n2\n5(Ref1 )\n5MPl\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we have identified\n3 2\nRef1 = MPl\n2\n\nand\n\n\u039b=\n\nAs is clear from the above equations, the cosmological constant in the standard\npure supergravity is always zero or negative, as is required by local supersymmetry. Since we are not interested in the standard supergravity, we assume that\nF \u2032\u2032 6= 0 in what follows.\n5\n\n\fLet's now investigate the simplest non-trivial Ansatz (F \u2032\u2032 = const. 6= 0) for\nthe F (R) supergravity function in the form\n1\n1\n(16)\nF (R) = f0 \u2212 f1 R + f2 R2\n2\n2\nwith three coupling constants f0 , f1 and f2 . We will take all of them to be real,\nsince we will ignore this potential source of CP -violation in what follows. As\nregards the mass dimensions of the quantities introduced, we have\n[F ] = [f0 ] = 3 ,\n\n[R] = [f1 ] = 2 ,\n\nand [R] = [f2 ] = 1\n\nThe bosonic Lagrangian (4) with the function (16) reads\n\u0001\n(\u2212g)\u22121/2 Lbos = 11f2 X 3 \u2212 7f1 X 2 + 32 f2 R + 6f0 X \u2212 13 f1 R\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nHence, the auxiliary field equation (6) takes the form of a quadratic equation,\n2\n33\n2 f2 X\n\n\u2212 7f1 X + 31 Rf2 + 3f0 = 0\n\n(19)\n\nwhose solution is given by\n\"\n#\nr\n2 * 11\n7\nf1\nX\u00b1 =\n\u00b1\n(Rmax \u2212 R)\n3 * 11 f2\n72\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we have introduced the maximal scalar curvature (cf. refs. [22, 23])\nRmax\n\nf0\n72 f12\n\u2212 32\n=\n2\n2 * 11 f2\nf2\n\n(21)\n\nEquation (20) obviously implies the automatic bound [12]\nR < Rmax\n\n(22)\n\nIt is worth mentioning that eq. (22) is better interpreted as the lower (or AdS)\nbound on the scalar curvature (\u2212R). For example, in our notation, a de-Sitter\nspace has a negative (constant) scalar curvature RdS < 0, whereas an anti-deSitter space has a positive (constant) scalar curvature, RAdS > 0. It is therefore\nnatural to demand Rmax > 0 (or, equivalently, \u2212Rmax < 0), in order to allow a\nflat space (R = 0) too.

Should f1 be positive, all the remaining stability conditions are automatically\n(\u2212)\n(\u2212)\nsatisfied, ie. in the case of both f2 > 0 and f1 > 0.\n(\u2212)\nShould f1 be negative, f1 < 0, we find that the remaining stability conditions\n(32) and (34) are the same, as they should, while they are both given by\nR < Rmax \u2212\n\n192 f12\n3 * 5 f12\nf0\nins\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212 32 \u2261 Rmax\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2 * 11 f2\n2 * 11 f2\nf2\n\n(36)\n\nAs regards the (+)-case, eq.

For example, as was demonstrated in ref. [12] for the special case\nf0 = 0, 5 a cosmological expansion is possible in the regime (i) towards the regime\n(ii), and then, perhaps, to the regime (iii) unless an instability occurs.\nHowever, one should be careful since our toy-model (16) does not pretend to\nbe viable in the low-curvature regime, eg., for the present Universe. Nevertheless,\nif one wants to give it some physical meaning there, by identifying it with General\nRelativity, then one should also fine-tune the cosmological constant \u039bl in eq. (44)\nto be \"small\" and positive. We find that it amounts to\nRmax \u2248\n\n4\n34 * 72 * 11 MPl\n\u2261 R\u039b=0\n25 * 192 f22\n\n(47)\n\nwith the actual value of Rmax to be \"slightly\" above of that bound, Rmax > R\u039b=0 .\nIt is also posssible to have the vanishing cosmological constant, \u039bl = 0, when\nchoosing Rmax = R\u039b=0 . It is worth mentioning that it relates the values of Rmax\nand f2 .\nAs is well known [5, 6, 7, 24, 25], an f (R) gravity theory (3) is classically\nequivalent to a scalar-tensor gravity having the action\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n\u221a\n\u2212R 1 \u03bc\u03bd\n4\n+ g \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n(48)\nS[g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6] = d x \u2212g\n2\u03ba2 2\nin terms of the scalaron field \u03c6(x) with the scalar potential V (\u03c6). The equivalence\nis established via a Legendre-Weyl transform [5, 7, 25]. In our notation we have 6\nr\n2 \u03c6\nf (R) = Z(ey ) \u2212 Rey , R = Z \u2032 (ey ) , \u2212f \u2032 (R) = ey ,\ny=\n(49)\n3 MPl\nso that the scalar potential is given by [25]\n1 2 \u22122y\nV (y) = \u2212 MPl\ne Z(ey )\n2\n\n(50)\n\nIt is worth noticing that the stability condition (9) implies an invertibility of\nthe 3rd equation (49), ie. R = R(y).\nFor instance, the simplest Starobinsky model of chaotic inflation [3, 13] corresponds to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2\nR2\nfS (R) = \u2212 MPl R \u2212\n(51)\n2\n6M 2\n5\n6\n\nSee also ref.

(52) is the vacuum energy that\nwhere V0 = 43 MPl\ndrives inflaton towards the minimum of its scalar potential (so that the inflation\nhas an end).

[12]\nin an attempt to get viable embedding of the Starobinsky model into F (R)supergravity. However, it failed because, as was found in ref. [12], the higherorder curvature terms cannot be ignored in eq. (29), ie. the Rn -terms with n \u2265 3\n11\n\n\fare not small enough against the R2 -term. 7 The most general Ansatz (16), which\nis merely quadratic in the supercurvature, does not help for that purpose either.\nFor example, the full f (R)-gravity function f\u2212 (R) in eq. (29), which we derived from our R2 -supergravity, gives rise to the inflaton scalar potential\n\u00012\nV (y) = V0 (11ey + 3) e\u2212y \u2212 1\n(60)\n4\nwhere V0 = (33 /26 )MPl\n/f22.

A solution to\nthis problem was found in ref. [13] by adding to eq. (16) an extra term that is\ncubic in the supercurvature, with a large dimensionless coefficient.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to introduce the new approach to the cosmological\nmodel building based on F (R) supergravity, develop the techniques of deriving\nf (R)-gravity from F (R) supergravity, and apply them to the simplest example\n(16) with F \u2032\u2032 (R) = const. 6= 0. Our choice (16) of the F -function was not\nphysically motivated but was dictated by technical simplicity only. Already the\nsimplest example (16) reveals several important new features that are superior\nto those of the usual supergravity characterized by F \u2032\u2032 (R) = 0, namely,\n\u2022 not any f (R)-gravity is extendable to F (R) supergravity; a simple (polynomial) choice of the F (R)-function leads to a complicated (non-polynomial)\nbosonic f (R)-function;\n\u2022 it is easy to get a positive cosmological constant, see eg., eq. (31); it may\nhave physical applications to (primordial) dark energy;\n\u2022 the natural appearance of the (AdS) bound on the scalar curvature, resembling the Special Relativity bound on the physical speed, and similar to\nthe Born-Infeld bound on the maximal values of the electro-magnetic field\nstrength;\n7\n\nThe possibility of destabilizing the Starobinsky inflationary scenario by the terms with\nhigher powers of the scalar curvature, in the context of f (R)-gravity, was noticed earlier in\nrefs. [28, 29].\n\n12\n\n\f\u2022 the existence of instabilities;\n\u2022 removing the obstacles for a simple and natural (F-term-type) realization\nof the cosmological inflation in supergravity [13].\nAs regards the last statement, some comments are in order. As is well known\n[24], there is a generic problem of realizing inflation in supergravity, the socalled \u03b7-problem [30]. To avoid the \u03b7-problem, one usually assumes that the\nK\u00e4hler potential of the chiral matter does not depend upon some chiral superfields\n(called flat directions), while the inflaton is supposed to be associated with one\nof the flat directions [31, 32]. Though it is possible to realize inflation that way,\nthe mechanism is apparently non-geometrical and requires extra fields beyond\nsupergravity. On the other side, the f (R)-gravity realization of inflation is easy\nand geometrical [1, 2], there exist its very economical formulation [3], while it\ncan also be extended to F (R) supergravity [13].\nSince F (R) supergravity is classically equivalent to some standard chiral\nmatter-coupled supergravity [9], one may wonder, how F (R) supergravity avoids\nthe \u03b7-problem? The basic explanation is that the K\u00e4hler potential, which follows\nfrom F (R) supergravity, appears to be non-trivial (ie. is given by a non-linear\nsigma-model), whereas its naive (free) form was one of the main assumptions\nused in the \u03b7-problem derivation [30].\nMoreover, it is difficult to analyze the stability conditions and compute the\nspectral indices of inflation in any matter-coupled supergravity model with a\nnon-trivial K\u00e4hler potential of matter. 8 Therefore, the possibility of a relatively\nsimple analysis on the F (R) supergravity side is yet another advantage of our\napproach.\nBoth the Legendre-Weyl transform in f (R) gravity and the Legendre-WeylK\u00e4hler transform in F (R)-supergravity, needed to prove their equivalence to the\nscalar-tensor gravity (quintessence) and the standard matter-coupled supergravity, respectively, apply at the classical level, while they are likely to fail at the\nquantum level, because of the non-renormalizability on the quantum field theories\non both sides. Revealing the (quantum) origin of the higher-order scalar supercurvature terms in the supergravity function F (R) (say, from some fundamental\ntheory of Quantum Gravity, like Superstrings/M-theory) is beyond the scope of\nthis paper and beyond our ability at present.\nWe do not exclude possible applications of F (R) supergravity to the present\nUniverse and the present Dark Energy, by choosing an appropriate function F (R).\nHowever, one needs more physical reasoning for applying supergravity to a lowcurvature cosmology. In its turn, it requires knowing more details about supersymmetry breaking. The example (16) considered in this paper does not have\nthe correct Newton limit, unless the first and last terms in eq. (16) are negligible.\n8\n\nSee, however, a recent limited analysis in ref. [33].\n\n13\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nOne of the authors (SVK) is grateful to H. Abe, L. Amendola, G. Dvali, A. De\nFelice, A.
