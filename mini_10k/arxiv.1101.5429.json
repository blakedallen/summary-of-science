Each of the two\natoms is located within an isolated and dissipative cavity. If the interaction time of atoms and\ncavities is not very long, the amount of quantum discord and entanglement between two atoms\ndecreases as the system evolves. The sudden death of quantum discord and entanglement of two\natoms occurs within a short interaction time. However, after a long interaction time, quantum\ndiscord and entanglement of two atoms could be partially preserved due to the long-lived nature\nof quantum discord and entanglement. Surprisingly, we find the amount of long-lived quantum\ndiscord could be smaller than that of long-lived entanglement. Thus, entanglement may be more\nrobust than quantum discord against decoherence.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Quantum entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum information processing and quantum\ncomputation [1\u20133]. In recent years, many efforts have\nbeen invested in the study of the evolution of joint systems formed by two subsystems (each system locally interacts with its environment) [4\u20139]. In particular, the entanglement of a two-qubit system may disappear for a finite time during the dynamics evolution. The nonsmooth\nfinite-time disappearance of entanglement is called \"entanglement sudden death\" (ESD). Experimentally, the ESD\nphenomenon has been observed in the laboratory by several groups for optical setups [10,11] and atomic ensembles\n[12].\n\nqubit [24]. Quantum discord introduced in [25, 26] is another kind of quantum correlation different from entanglement. Very recently, quantum discord has been investigated widely [27\u201330]. Note that all the previous studies [27\u201330] have shown that, for several quantum systems,\nthere is no quantum discord sudden death (DSD). However, quantum discord is a kind of quantum correlation in\ncomposite quantum systems. Since entanglement of quantum systems can stay zero for a finite time (ESD), a natural question is whether there is DSD in quantum systems\nwith ESD. Here, we present a quantum system where there\nexists DSD as well as ESD. We also explain why there is\nno DSD in [30]. Furthermore, we find that there is also\nOne the other hand, quantum entanglement is not the long-lived quantum discord.

In fact, it was shown both ment in cavity QED [31\u201334] or solid state systems [35].

S. Zhang et al.\nquantum discord and entanglement of a quantum system\nformed by two two-level atoms within two spatially separated and dissipative cavities in the dispersive limit using\nthe results of [36]. The two atoms are initially prepared\nin the Werner states [6] and the cavities are initially prepared in coherent states. We show that both DSD and\nESD can appear in the present system. The amount of\nquantum discord and entanglement of two atoms decreases\nwith time in the short-term. However, the long-term behavior is very different since a long survival of quantum\ndiscord and entanglement are shown in the system. This\nimplies that quantum discord and entanglement of two\natoms could be partially preserved even they are put into\ndissipative cavities. Unlike the results in [27, 30], our results show that the amount of long-lived quantum discord\ncould be smaller than that of long-lived entanglement. In\nother words, quantum entanglement may be more robust\nthan quantum discord in the present model.\n\nwhere \u03c1e is the density matrix of the atom-field\n\u0013\n\u0012 system.\n\u03b6a \u03b6c\nIf the initial state of the two-level atom is\n\u03b6c\u2217 \u03b6b\nand the field P\nis initially prepared in a coherent state\nn\n2\n\u221e\n|\u03b1i = e\u2212|\u03b1| /2 n=0 \u221a\u03b1n! |ni with \u03b1 being a complex number.

In Fig. 1, quantum discord and\nentanglement are plotted as functions of the dimensionless\nscaled time \u03a9t for \u03b1 = 0.5 (upper panel) and \u03b1 = 1 (lower\npanel). Clearly, there is ESD in the present model as one\ncan see from Fig. 1. From the upper panel of Fig. 1, one\nmay conclude that there is no DSD, which is consistent\nwith the results of [27, 30]. However, this is not always\ncorrect. As one can easily observe from the lower panel of\nFig. 1, if we increase the intensity of the coherent fields\nthat is proportional to |\u03b1|2 , there is DSD. We note that in\nthis figure, quantum discord is larger than entanglement,\nwhich is coincidence with the observations of [27,30]. However, this is not a general result since quantum discord and\nentanglement are two different quantities and there is no\nsimple relative ordering between them. For example, for\nthe Werner states defined by \u03c1 = p|\u03c8\u2212 ih\u03c8\u2212 | + 1\u2212p\n4 , where\n\u221a\n|\u03c8\u2212 i = (|egi \u2212 |gei)/ 2, quantum discord may be lager\nor smaller than entanglement [36].\nWe now want to explain why there is no DSD in the case\nof dephasing channel in [30]. At first sight, the elements\nof the density matrix of the dephasing case is very similar\n\np-3\n\n\fJ. S.

Upper panel:\n\u03b1 = 0.5. Lower panel: \u03b1 = 1. There is no DSD in the upper\npanel with \u03b1 = 0.5. However, the lower panel clearly shows\nthe existence of DSD in the case of \u03b1 = 1.\n\nto the matrix elements of Eq. (7). Let us focus on the offdiagonal elements \u03c123 (t) of [30], i.e., \u03c123 (t) = e\u2212\u0393t \u03c123 (0),\nwhere \u0393 is the decay rate. Obviously, the term e\u2212\u0393t becomes zero only in the asymptotic limit t \u2192 \u221e. Quantum\ndiscord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit, which behaves similarly to decoherence of each atom [30]. In the\npresent work, the off-diagonal element \u03c123 (t) is much more\ncomplicated than that of [30] and it is possible for quantum discord to stay zero for a finite time. Physically, the\ninfluence of the interactions between atoms and cavities,\nand the mean photon number and decay rate of dissipative cavities upon quantum discord has not bee considered\nin [30]. Here, all the above influence upon the dynamics\nof quantum discord and entanglement is taken into accounted. In this sense, the results of [30] can only reveal parts of the properties of quantum discord (no DSD),\nwhich is consistent with the upper panel of Fig. 1. However, the lower panel of Fig. 1, which indicates the existence of DSD, can not appear in [30].\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200 \u03a9t\n\nFig. 2: Quantum discord (solid line) and entanglement (dotted\nline) of two atoms are plotted as functions of the dimensionless\nscaled time \u03a9t with \u03b3/\u03a9 = 0.01, and \u03b1 = 0.5. Upper panel:\np = 0.5. Lower panel: p = 0.8. Comparing the upper and lower\npanel, we see that long-lived quantum discord could be larger\n(upper panel) or smaller (lower panel) than long-lived entanglement. In other words, quantum entanglement may be more\nrobust than quantum discord in the presence of decoherence.\nThis result is different from the previous work [27, 30]\n\nwith the increase of the parameter p. The relative ordering\nof quantum discord and entanglement depends heavily on\nthe purity p. For example, in the case of p = 0.5, long-lived\nquantum discord is larger than long-lived entanglement.\nHowever, in the case of p = 0.8, we find that, in contrast\nto the results of [27,30], the amount of long-lived quantum\ndiscord could be smaller than that of long-lived entanglement. In other words, quantum entanglement could be\nmore robust than discord against decoherence. Thus, it\nis difficult for us to make a general statement whether or\nnot quantum discord is more robust against decoherence\nthan entanglement. Intuitively, quantum discord is different from entanglement and it is difficult to make a general\nconclusion about the relative ordering of the amount of\nquantum discord and entanglement in the presence of decoherence. In order to show the influence of decoherence of\ncavities upon the quantum discord of two atoms, we plot\nthe quantum discord of two atoms in Fig.3. Note that it\nhas been proved that white noise of cavity fields can play\na constructive role in the generation of entanglement in\ncavity QED systems [43]. Here, Fig. 3 demonstrates that\nthe dissipation of cavity fields may also play a constructive role in the generation of quantum discord. Note that\nin Figs. (1)-(3), we have assumed the atoms are initially\nprepared in \u03c1\u03c6 . One can also consider the dynamics of\nquantum discord and entanglement if the initial state of\natoms is \u03c1\u03c8 and the results are similar.\n\nLong-lived quantum discord and entanglement. As we\nhave pointed out previously, little attention has been paid\nto long-lived quantum discord even though lots of work\nhas been made on long-lived entanglement [31\u201335]. Here,\nwe consider the question of whether there is long-lived\nquantum discord and entanglement in the present model.\nThe influence of the purity of the initial state of atoms\nupon the long-time behavior of quantum discord and entanglement is also discussed.\nIn Fig. 2, quantum discord and entanglement as functions of the dimensionless scaled time \u03a9t are plotted for\np = 0.5 (upper panel) and p = 0.8 (lower panel). It is\neasy to observe that the long-time behavior of quantum\ndiscord and entanglement depends on the purity of the initial state of atoms. This figure is a direct evidence of the\nConclusions. \u2013 In the present work, we have studpresence of long-lived quantum discord and entanglement\nin the present system. Comparing the upper panel with ied the dynamics of quantum discord and entanglement\nthe lower one of Fig. 2, one can see that the amount of of two two-level atoms without direct interactions. Each\nlong-lived quantum discord and entanglement will increase atom is put into a spatially separated and dissipative cavp-4\n\n\fSudden death and robustness of quantum discord and entanglement\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nD\n0.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4 \u0393\u0090W\n\n0\n2\n4\nWt\n\n6\n0.2\n\n8\n10 0\n\nFig. 3: Quantum discord of two atoms are plotted as functions\nof the dimensionless scaled time \u03a9t and parameter \u03b3/\u03a9 with\n\u03b1 = 1 and p = 0.8.\n\nity in the dispersive limit. We first investigated the shorttime behavior of quantum discord and entanglement in\nthe presence of dissipation. The amount of quantum discord and entanglement of two atoms decreases with time\nif the interaction time is not very long. Particularly, we\nhave shown that both DSD and ESD could appear simultaneously in the present system. This is different from the\nresults of [27, 30]. Then, we discussed the long-time behavior of quantum discord and entanglement of two atoms.\nWe show there is long-lived quantum discord and entanglement in the presence of the dissipation of cavities. Our\nresults show that quantum entanglement may be more robust against decoherence than quantum discord. Finally,\nwe would like to point out that it could be possible to\nstudy quantum discord of any dimensional bipartite states\nfrom a geometrical point of view [44]. It is also interesting\nto compare the results of any dimensional bipartite states\nin the presence of decoherence with our work.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThis project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 11047115\nand 11065007), the Scientific Research Foundation of\nJiangxi Provincial Department of Education (Grant Nos\nGJJ10135 and GJJ09504), and the Foundation of Talent\nof Jinggang of Jiangxi Province (Grant No 2008DQ00400).\nREFERENCES\n[1] Nielsen M.
