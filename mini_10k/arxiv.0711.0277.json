Given a total system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission,\nhow many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to maximize the number\nof simultaneous links in the network?

Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value of N in terms\nof the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold \u2013 which\ndirectly corresponds to the optimal spectral efficiency \u2013 is derived for both the low SNR (power-limited) and high\nSNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the optimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms\nof the path loss exponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nFor purposes of wireless communication, the electromagnetic spectrum is typically first divided into a large\nnumber of bands by regulatory agencies such as the FCC or the European Commission. These bands are typically\nallocated by executive fiat or auction, and for particular purposes. Once allocated, these bands are usually further\ndivided into many smaller bands that individual users have access to. This entire process has a major impact on\nthe efficiency with which spectral resources are used, but historically appears to have been done in a mostly ad\nhoc manner. This paper attempts to develop a theoretical basis for bandwidth partitioning, in particular the second\npartitioning of an allocated band into subbands.\nTo be more specific, consider a spatially distributed wireless network, representing either an ad hoc network or\nan unlicensed (and uncoordinated) spectrum system, e.g., 802.11. In such systems it is common to have a fixed total\nbandwidth, a large number of potential users, and a limit on acceptable packet loss rates. It is also typical to have\na target data rate for each user, either to support a certain application or due to user expectations. This gives rise\nto the following basic question: given bandwidth W and a fixed rate requirement R for each transmitter-receiver\nlink in the network, how many slots N of size W/N should this band be partitioned into in order to maximize the\nnumber of links (i.e., spatial density of transmissions) that can achieve this rate R at a specified outage probability\n(i.e., packet error rate)?\nFor example, given 1 MHz of bandwidth and a desired rate of 1 Mbps, should (a) each transmitter utilize the\nentire spectrum and thus require an SINR of 1 (utilizing R = W log2 (1 + SINR) bits/sec), (b) the band be split\ninto two 0.5 MHz sub-bands where each transmitter utilizes one of the sub-bands with a required SINR of 3, or (c)\nthe band be split into N > 2 orthogonal N1 MHz sub-bands where each transmitter utilizes one of the sub-bands\nwith a required SINR of 2N \u2212 1?\nIncreasing the number of sub-bands N has two competing effects. On the positive side, it allows for parallel,\nnon-interfering communications on different sub-bands. On the negative side, transmitting at the same data rate\nover less bandwidth requires each transmission to be performed at a higher spectral efficiency (R bps over W\nN\nR\nHz corresponds to a spectral efficiency of W/N\nbps/Hz), which translates to a higher SINR requirement and thus\nThe authors are with the ECE Departments of the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas at Austin, and Drexel University,\nrespectively. e-mail: nihar@umn.edu, jandrews@ece.utexas.edu, sweber@ece.drexel.edu.\nThis work is supported under an NSF collaborative research grant awarded to the three authors (NSF grant #0635003 (Weber), #0634979\n(Andrews), and #0634763 (Jindal)), and by the DARPA IT-MANET program, Grant W911NF-07-1-0028 (Andrews, Jindal, Weber).

The objective of this paper is understanding this tradeoff and characterizing the\noptimum value of N in terms of the system parameters.\nA. Technical Approach\nTo allow for analytical tractability, we optimize the number of sub-bands for a network consisting of transmitterreceiver pairs distributed on the two-dimensional plane. More specifically, the network we consider has the following\nkey characteristics:\n\u2022 Transmitter locations are a realization of a homogeneous spatial Poisson process.\n\u2022 Each transmitter communicates with a single receiver that is a distance d meters away.\n\u2022 All transmissions occur at power \u03c1 and rate R bits/sec, the noise spectral density is N0 , and attenuation follows\npath-loss exponent \u03b1.\nW\n\u2022 The system bandwidth of W Hz is divided into N equal sub-bands of N Hz, and each transmission occurs\non a randomly chosen sub-band.\n\u2022 Each receiver treats multi-user interference as noise, and thus a transmission is successful if and only if the\nreceived SINR is larger than a threshold determined by R, W , and N .\nThe second to last assumption should make it clear that we are considering only an off-line optimization of the\nfrequency band structure, and that no on-line (e.g., channel- and queue-based) transmission or sub-band decisions\nare considered.\nBy considering such a network, tools from stochastic geometry can be used to characterize the distribution of\nreceived interference and thus to quantify the success probability of each transmission as a function of the transmitter\ndensity and the SINR threshold. In this context, the question at hand is determining the value of N that maximizes\nsuccess probability for a given spatial density of transmitters. Rather than considering the optimization in terms of\nR\nN , it is convenient to pose the problem in terms of the spectral efficiency of each communication W/N\n. Our main\nresult is an exact characterization of the optimal spectral efficiency in the form of a simple fixed point equation.1\nFurthermore, the optimal spectral efficiency is seen to be a function only of the path-loss exponent and the energy\nEb\n= NP0 R (where P is the received power, N0 is the noise spectral density, and R is the rate\nper information bit N\n0\n[3]), and thus is independent of the transmitter\ndensity. In order for a network to operate optimally, N should be\n\u0001\nincreased until the spectral efficiency NWR is equal to its optimal value.\nEb\n\u2192 \u221e), the network is purely\nWhen thermal noise is negligible relative to the received signal power (i.e., N\n0\ninterference-limited and the optimal spectral efficiency is a function of the path loss exponent (\u03b1) alone. For\nreasonable path loss exponents the optimal spectral efficiency lies between the low-SNR and high-SNR regimes.\nFor example, the optimal is 1.3 bps/Hz (SINR threshold of 1.6 dB) and 2.3 bps/Hz (SINR threshold of 5.9 dB)\nEb\nfor \u03b1 = 3 and \u03b1 = 4, respectively. When thermal\nnoise is not negligible (i.e., N\nis small), the optimal spectral\n0\n\u0001\nefficiency is shown to be the fraction 1 \u2212 \u03b12 of the maximum spectral efficiency achievable in the absence of\ninterference.\nIncreasing N , which corresponds to decreasing the bandwidth and increasing the area consumed by each\ntransmission, is seen to be beneficial as long as area (i.e., the SINR threshold) increases at a reasonable rate\nwith N . For interference-limited networks this is true until the high-SNR regime is reached, at which point a huge\nSINR increase is required for any additional bandwidth reduction. For power-limited networks this is true until\nthe SINR threshold approaches the interference-free SNR, at which point the system becomes overly sensitive to\ninterference.\nB. Related Work\nThe problem studied in this work is essentially the optimization of frequency reuse in uncoordinated decentralized\nnetworks, which is a well studied problem in the context of centrally-planned cellular and other hierarchical\nnetworks; see for example [4], [5], [6] and references therein. In both settings the tradeoff is between the bandwidth\nutilized per cell or transmission \u2013 which is inversely proportional to the frequency reuse factor \u2013 and the achieved\nSINR/spectral efficiency per transmission. A key difference is that regular frequency reuse patterns can be used\nin cellular networks, whereas in an ad hoc or unlicensed network this is impossible. Another crucial difference\n1\n\nBecause SINR is a function of spectral efficiency, this is equivalent to a derivation of the optimal SINR threshold.\n\n\f3\n\nis in terms of analytical tractability. Although there has been a tremendous amount of work on frequency reuse\noptimization for cellular networks, these efforts generally do not lead to clean analytical results. On the contrary, in\nthis work we are able to derive simple analytical results for decentralized networks that cleanly show the dependence\nof the optimal reuse factor on basic system parameters.\nA number of works have considered related problems in the context of decentralized networks, although none\nappear to have investigated the optimization considered here. In [7] the time-bandwidth-area product achieved by\ndifferent codes are evaluated. This metric is essentially equivalent to the inverse of transmission density in our\nnetwork model, but the authors do not pursue optimization of this metric, which is the essence of our work.\nIn [8], the authors jointly optimize rate, transmitter-receiver distance (d), and density in order to maximize the\ntransport capacity (i.e., product of rate and distance) of a random-access network. This setting is very different\nfrom our framework in which we assume a fixed rate and transmitter-receive distance, and as a result conclusions\ndiffer significantly. For example, the optimum SINR threshold in [8] for some networks is found to be orders\nof magnitude smaller than 0 dB, whereas we find optimal values around 0 dB. In [9] a network consisting of a\nlarge number of interfering transmitter-receiver pairs is analyzed, but no spatial model is used and only fading\nis considered. In [10] the issue of frequency reuse is considered in a one-dimensional, evenly spaced, multi-hop\nwireless network. Some similar general insights are derived, but the regular spacing of interferers seems to prevent\nderivation of clean analytical results as is possible for the 2-D network considered here. In a recent contribution\nthe interactions between multiple random-access networks have been considered from a game-theoretic perspective\n[11], and portions of the analysis of a single network in [11] coincide with our initial findings reported earlier in [1].\nThere has also been a good deal of work on multi-channel wireless networks, but this body of work generally deals\nwith scheduled networks as opposed to our treatment of unscheduled networks (see [12] and references therein).\nPerhaps most relevant is [13], in which algorithms for dynamic allocation of bandwidth-area resources are proposed.\nII. P RELIMINARIES\nA. Network Model\nWe consider a set of transmitting nodes at an arbitrary snapshot in time with locations specified by a homogeneous\nPoisson point process (PPP) of intensity \u03bb on the infinite 2-D plane. All nodes are assumed to simultaneously\ntransmit with power \u03c1. By the stationarity of the PPP it is sufficient to analyze the behavior of a single reference\nTX-RX pair (TX 0, RX 0), separated by assumption by a distance d. Note that the receivers are not a part of the\ntransmitter process. From the perspective of RX 0, the interferers follow the distribution of the PPP conditioned on\nthe location of TX 0 (referred to as the Palm distribution). However, by Slivnyak's theorem [14] this distribution is\nthe same as the unconditional distribution and therefore the locations of the interfering nodes form a homogeneous\nPPP of intensity \u03bb. Received power is modeled by path loss with exponent \u03b1 > 2. If Xi denotes the distance of\nthe i-th transmitting node to the reference receiver and the transmit signal of the i-th transmitter is denoted as Ui ,\nthe reference received signal is:\nX\n\u2212\u03b1/2\nY0 = U0 d\u2212\u03b1/2 +\nUi Xi\n+ Zi\ni\u2208\u03a0(\u03bb)\n\nwhere Zi is additive Gaussian noise with power \u03b7 . The resulting SINR therefore is:\nSINR0 =\n\n\u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03b7+\n\nP\n\n\u2212\u03b1 ,\ni\u2208\u03a0(\u03bb) \u03c1Xi\n\nwhere \u03a0(\u03bb) indicates the point process describing the (random) interferer locations. If Gaussian signaling is\nused, the received mutual information (conditioned on interferer locations) is I(U0 ; Y0 |\u03a0(\u03bb)) = log2 (1 + SINR0 )\nbits/symbol. In the fixed rate setting considered here, the probability the received mutual information is smaller\nthan the transmission rate is known to be a good approximation to packet error rate if strong channel coding is\nused [15], and thus is the primary metric in this work.\nA few comments in justification of our model are in order. Although the model contains many simplifications\nto allow for tractability, it contains many of the critical elements of a real decentralized network. First, the spatial\nPoisson distribution means that transmitting nodes are randomly and independently located; this is reasonable in\na network with indiscriminate node placement or substantial mobility assuming that no intelligent transmission\n\n\f4\n\nscheduling is performed Scheduling generally attempts to ensure that simultaneous transmissions are sufficiently\nseparated in space, and thus can significantly change the spatial distribution of simultaneous transmissions. However,\neven simple scheduling protocols can incur considerable overhead and latency and thus unscheduled systems (or\nsystems using ALOHA-like protocols that make transmission decisions independent of interference conditions) as\nconsidered here are of interest. This is particularly true when scheduling overhead begins to overtake the advantage\nof scheduling, as may be the case with high mobility or very bursty traffic. The assumptions of fixed TX-RX\ndistances and no fading are often not reasonable, but as we discuss in Section VI-B our results also apply to\nnetworks with fading and/or variable distances in the interference-limited regime (no thermal noise). Furthermore,\nour results are reasonably accurate in the presence of non-negligible thermal noise when the fading and distance\nvariation is not too large. Finally, we note that fixed- rather than variable-rate communication is appropriate for\nsome, but not necessarily all, settings, e.g., single-hop communication with very stringent delay constraints. In\nother settings (e.g., when delay constraints are less stringent) variable rate communication is more appropriate;\noptimizing bandwidth partitioning in this context is of interest but is outside the scope of this work.\nB. Outage Probability/Maximum Density Characterization\nAn outage occurs whenever the SINR falls below threshold \u03b2 , or equivalently whenever the received mutual\ninformation is smaller than log2 (1 + \u03b2). Therefore, the system-wide outage probability is:\n!\n\u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\nPout (\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b7) , P\n\u2264\u03b2 .\nP\n\u03b7 + i\u2208\u03a0(\u03bb) \u03c1Xi\u2212\u03b1\n\nThis quantity is computed over the distribution of transmitter positions and is an increasing function of the intensity\n\u03bb. The SINR threshold \u03b2 and the noise power \u03b7 are treated as constants here, but are related to R, W , and N in\nthe following section.

Although a closed form expression for FZ (*) is not known\nexcept for the special case of \u03b1 = 4 [16], this characterization of the outage probability allows us to derive an\nexact solution to the bandwidth partition problem.\nIn many scenarios, the network is subject to an outage constraint and the quantity of interest is the maximum\nintensity of attempted transmissions \u03bb\u01eb such that the outage probability (for a fixed \u03b2 ) is no larger than \u01eb. Because\noutage probability increases monotonically with density, an expression for \u03bb\u01eb is reached by inverting (1):\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b1\nFZ\u22121 (\u01eb) 1\n\u03b7\n\u2212\n\u03bb\u01eb =\n(2)\n\u03c0d2\n\u03b2 \u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\n\n\f5\n\nParameter\nR\nW\n\u03c1\nN0\nd\n\u2212\u03b1\nEb\n= \u03c1d\nN0\nN0 R\n\u01eb\nN\n\u03b2\n\nDescription\nTransmission Rate (bits/sec)\nTotal System Bandwidth (Hz)\nTransmission Power\nNoise Spectral Density\nTransmitter-Receiver Distance\nEnergy per Information Bit\nOutage Constraint\nNumber of Sub-Bands\nSINR Threshold\n\nTABLE I\nS UMMARY OF S YSTEM PARAMETERS\n\nwhere FZ\u22121 (*) is the inverse of FZ (*).\nBecause the SINR is upper bounded by only considering the contribution of the nearest interferer, a necessary\n(but not sufficient)2 condition for successful communication is that a circle centered about the receiver of area\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2212\n\u03b1\n\u03c0d2 \u03b21 \u2212 \u03c1d\u03b7\u2212\u03b1\nbe free of interferers [17]. On the other hand, the effective area consumed by each transmission\nwhen an outage level of \u01eb is required is the inverse of the density \u03bb\u01eb :\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212 2\n\u03b1\n1\n1\n\u03b7\n1\n2\n\u03c0d\n= \u22121\n\u2212 \u2212\u03b1\n,\n(3)\n\u03bb\u01eb\n\u03b2\n\u03c1d\nFZ (\u01eb)\nwhich is the interferer-free area from the necessary condition above multiplied by the constant F \u221211 (\u01eb) . This constant\nZ\nfactor, which increases without bound as \u01eb \u2192 0 and which is larger than one for all but the largest values of \u01eb,\naccounts for the fact that transmitters are randomly located and can be intuitively thought of as a back-off parameter\nthat ensures the outage constraint is met. This interpretation turns out to be useful when interpreting bandwidth\npartitioning in terms of bandwidth and area.\nIII. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION\n\nAND\n\nG ENERAL S OLUTION\n\nWe are now able to address the problem of interest, which is determining the number of sub-bands that maximize\nthe density of transmissions such that the outage probability is no larger than \u01eb. As made explicit at the end of this\nsection, finding the value of N that minimizes outage probability for a fixed total density of transmitters is the dual\nof this problem and has precisely the same solution. For the reader's reference, the relevant system parameters are\nsummarized in Table I.\nIf the system bandwidth is not split (N = 1), each node utilizes the entire bandwidth of W Hz. The SINR required\n(\u03b2 ) to achieve a rate of R bps is determined by inverting the AWGN capacity expression R = W log2 (1 + \u03b2),\nR\nwhich gives \u03b2 = 2 W \u2212 1. The maximum intensity of transmissions can be determined by evaluating (2) with this\nvalue of \u03b2 and \u03b7 = N0 W . If the system bandwidth is split into N > 1 orthogonal sub-bands each of width W\nN,\nand each transmitter-receiver pair uses one randomly selected sub-band, the required SINR \u03b2(N ) is determined by\ninverting the rate expression:\nNR\nW\n(4)\nlog2 (1 + \u03b2(N )) \u2192 \u03b2(N ) = 2 W \u2212 1.\nN\nBecause each transmitter randomly chooses a sub-band, the users on each sub-band are still a PPP and are\nindependent across bands. As a result, the maximum intensity of transmissions per sub-band is \u03bb\u01eb as defined\nin (2) with SINR threshold \u03b2(N ) and noise power \u03b7 = N0 W\nN . Since the N sub-bands are statistically identical, the\nmaximum total intensity of transmissions, denoted \u03bbT\u01eb , is the per sub-band intensity \u03bb\u01eb multiplied by N . Therefore,\nfrom (2) we have:\n!\n\u0001 ! \u03b12\nW\n\u22121\nN\n(\u01eb)\nF\n1\n0 N\nZ\n\u03bbT\u01eb (N ) = N\n.\n(5)\n\u2212\n\u03c0d2\n\u03b2(N )\n\u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\n\nR =\n\n\f6\n\nThe optimal number of sub-bands N \u2217 is that which maximizes total transmission density:\nN \u2217 = arg max \u03bbT\u01eb (N ).\n\n(6)\n\nN\n\nIt is useful to interpret this optimization in terms of bandwidth and area.

Total\nZ\ndensity is maximized by minimizing this quantity, i.e., by minimizing the bandwidth-area product of each transmission. It is easily checked that the interferer-free area is a strictly increasing function of N . Thus, as the number\nof sub-bands N is increased the bandwidth consumed by each transmission decreases while the area increases,\nleading to a non-trivial tradeoff.\nRather than solving the maximization in (6) with respect to N , it is more convenient to maximize with respect to\nthe operating spectral efficiency, which is equal to the transmission rate divided by the bandwidth of each sub-band:\nb,\n\nR\nbps/Hz.\nW/N\n\n(8)\n\nIt is important to note that the operating spectral efficiency b is a design parameter even though the per-transmission\nrate R and system bandwidth W are fixed.2\nWith this substitution the transmission density can be written as a function of b:\n!\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u22121\n(\u01eb)\nF\n1\n1 N0 R \u03b1\nW\nT\nZ\n\u03bb\u01eb (b) =\n(9)\n\u2212\nb\n\u03c0d2\nR\n2b \u2212 1 b \u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\nEb\nNoting\nthat \u0011the constant \u03c1d\nN0 R , N0 is the received energy per information bit [3] and defining the constant\n\u0010 \u22121\n\u0001\nF (\u01eb)\nW\n\u03ba , Z\u03c0d2\nR , this can be further simplified as:\n\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03bbT\u01eb (b)\n\n= \u03bab\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 Eb\nb\n2 \u2212 1 bN\n0\n\n!2\n\n\u03b1\n\n.\n\nThe optimal spectral efficiency b\u2217 is therefore the solution to the following optimization:\n!2\n\u03b1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n.\nb\u2217 = arg max b\nEb\nb>0\n2b \u2212 1 b N\n0\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nEb\nNote that the optimal b\u2217 depends only on the path loss exponent \u03b1 and N\n, and thus any dependence on power and\n0\nEb\nrate is completely captured by N\n.\nBy\nposing\nthe\nproblem\nin\nterms\nof\nspectral\nefficiency, any direct dependence\n0\non W is removed.

Note the non-monotonic behavior of \u03bb\u01eb \u03ba(b ) with \u03b1: the minimum occurs\nT\n\u2217\nat \u03b1 = 2.77, where \u03bb\u01eb \u03ba(b ) = b\u2217 = 1.\n\n\f10\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n\u03b1=4\n1\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b1=3\n0.6\n\n\u03b1 = 2.5\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1 = 2.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nSpectral efficiency (bps/Hz)\n\nFig. 4.\n\nDensity Constant\n\n\u03bbT\n\u01eb (b)\n\u03ba\n\nvs. Spectral Efficiency b for Interference-Limited Networks, \u03b1 = 2.1, 2.5, 3 , 4.\n\nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the optimal solution, let us first consider the behavior of \u03bbT\u01eb (b) when b is\nsmall, i.e. b \u226a 1. Because ex \u2212 1 \u2248 x for small x, the SINR threshold increasing approximately linearly with b:\n\u03b2 = 2b \u2212 1 \u2248 b loge 2. Plugging into (15) yields:\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2212 2\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03bbT\u01eb (b) = \u03bab 2b \u2212 1\n\u2248 \u03bab * b\u2212 \u03b1 = \u03bab(1\u2212 \u03b1 ) .\n\n2\nFor any path-loss exponent \u03b1 > 2, the density of transmissions increases as b(1\u2212 \u03b1 ) . Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of sub-bands N , or equivalently increasing the spectral efficiency b, leads to an increased transmission\ncapacity, as long as the linear approximation to \u03b2 remains valid. Recall that the area consumed by each transmission\n2\n2\nis proportional to \u03b2 \u03b1 (equation 7): if \u03b2 \u223c b, then area increases sub-linearly as b \u03b1 and this increase is offset by\nthe linear increase in the number of parallel transmissions. When b becomes larger, \u03b2 begins to grow exponentially\nrather than linearly with b (i.e., SINR must be doubled in dB units rather than in linear units in order to double\nspectral efficiency) and thus the benefit of further increasing the number of sub-bands is far outweighed by the\nSINR/area increase.\n\u0001\u2212 2\nThis behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4, where \u03bbT\u01eb (b) = \u03bab 2b \u2212 1 \u03b1 (with \u03ba = 1) is plotted versus b for different\nvalues of \u03b1. The function increases rapidly when b is small, but then decreases rapidly beyond its peak when the\nSINR cost becomes prohibitive. A larger path loss exponent makes the system less sensitive to interference, and\nthus the peak is attained at a larger value of b. It is interesting to note that all of the curves intersect at b = 1\nbecause \u03bbT\u01eb (1) = \u03ba for any value of \u03b1. Although b = 1 is quite sub-optimal when \u03b1 is near 2, \u03ba is reasonably\n2\n\u2217\nclose to the optimal \u03bab\u2217 (2b \u2212 1)\u2212 \u03b1 for exponents between 2.5 and 5 and thus is a rather robust operating point\nif the path loss exponent is not known exactly.\nA Design Example. Consider wireless LAN parameters that are conceptually similar to those of an 2.4 GHz\n802.11 system, that uses N = 3 bands of about 20 MHz. Assume the usable bandwidth is a total of W = 60 MHz,\nand that the desired rate is R = 10 Mbps and \u03b1 = 3. From Theorem 2 we can determine that\n\nN\u2217 =\n\nb\u2217\n1.26\n=\n= 7.56,\nR/W\nR/W\n\n(18)\n\nso the optimum partition is about N \u2217 = 8, or bands of 7.5 MHz. If however the data rate requirement is higher,\nlike 60 Mbps, then it can quickly be confirmed that N \u2217 = 1. That is, the maximum number of users can be\naccommodated at the higher data rate if each of them uses the entire band, since they can accept a lower received\nSINR with such a large bandwidth.\n\n\f11\n\n1\n\nSpectral Efficiency (bps/Hz)\n\n0.9\n\nAWGN\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nApproximation\n\n0.5\n\nOptimal\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\u03b1=4\n\n0.2\n\nApproximation\n0.1\n0\n\u22121.6\n\n\u03b1=3\n\u22121.4\n\n\u22121.2\n\nOptimal\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\nE /N (dB)\nb\n\nFig. 5.\n\nOptimal Spectral Efficiency b\u2217 vs.\n\nEb\nN0\n\n0\n\nfor Power-Limited Networks, \u03b1 = 3, 4.\n\nV.

Both\n0\n0\napproximations are seen to be very accurate.\nAlthough intuition might suggest that interference\n\u0010 \u0011can be ignored when thermal noise is so large, this is not the\nEb\ncase. If b is chosen only slightly smaller than C N\n, the SINR threshold is almost equal to the interference-free\n0\nSNR and thus each receiver is extremely sensitive to interference. As a result each communication consumes a\nlarge area, and this offsets the bandwidth savings of using a large b. On the other extreme, small b corresponds to\na small area because the SINR threshold is much smaller than the interference-free SNR, but this is offset by a\nlarge bandwidth which causes \u03bbT\u01eb (b) \u2192 0 as b \u2192 0.\nT\nThis behavior is illustrated\u0010in Fig.\n\u0011 7, where \u03bb\u01eb (b) (with \u03ba = 1) is plotted versus b for \u03b1 = 2.2, 3, and 4 at\nEb\nEb\nN0 = \u22120.82 dB (for which C N0 = 0.5 bps/Hz).

Fig. 8 contains plots of both quantities for N\nequal\n0\nto 30, 20, 5, and 0 dB, and the curves match almost exactly with any difference due purely to simulation error.\nb\u2217\nAccording to the chosen parameters we have N \u2217 = R/W\n= 10b\u2217 and \u03ba = 0.0032. Note that the optimizing spectral\nT\n\nEb\n= 30 dB and\nefficiency b\u2217 and the value of \u03bb\u01eb \u03ba(b ) can be read from Fig. 1.

At this point C N\n0\n0\nand the area spectral efficiency is reduced to 0.1.\nEb\nWhile N\nis generally thought to be adjusted by varying transmit power, it can also be\u0010 adjusted by\u0011 fixing the power\n0\n\u0001\u2212 2\n\u2217\nR\ne (1\u2212\u01eb)\nb\u2217 2b \u2212 1 \u03b1 ,\nbps/Hz/m2 is equal to \u2212 log\u03c0d\nand varying the rate R.

As a result, if a network is operating\nand therefore depends only on N\n0\noutside of the interference-limited regime, ASE can be tremendously increased by either increasing power or\ndecreasing rate (while keeping power fixed). However, this is only possible until the interference-limited regime is\nEb\n.\nreached; once there, ASE is unaffected by N\n0\n\nA. Direct Sequence Spread-Spectrum\nDirect-sequence (DS) spread spectrum is a well-established method for spectrum sharing in wireless networks. If\nDS is used with a spreading factor of N , a signal with an information bandwidth (i.e., symbol rate) of W\nN Hz can\nbe spread across the entire system bandwidth of W Hz. This is quite different than the method investigated so far,\nwhich be thought of as either FDMA or slow frequency-hopping. In [17] it is shown that DS is significantly inferior\nto splitting the frequency band (FDMA) for any particular bandwidth partition because it is preferable to avoid\ninterference (FDMA) rather than to suppress it (DS), and this conclusion also holds if the bandwidth is optimally\npartitioned.\nIf direct sequence is used with completely separate despreading and decoding (assuming spreading suppresses\n\n\f14\n\ninterference by a factor of N ), the SINR after despreading is given by:\nSINRDS =\n\nN0 (W/N ) +\n\n\u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\n1 P\nN\n\n\u2212\u03b1 .\ni\u2208\u03a0(\u03bb) \u03c1Xi\n\nWith some simple manipulation the outage probability is given by:\n#\n\"\n\u03c1d\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b2(N )\nP[SINRDS \u2264 \u03b2(N )] = P\n\u2264\nP\nN\nN0 W + i\u2208\u03a0(\u03bb) \u03c1Xi\u2212\u03b1\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b2(N ) is defined in (4). Therefore, the total transmission density for DS with spreading factor N is equal to\n)\n)\n\u03bb\u01eb as defined in (2) with threshold \u03b2(N\nand \u03b7 = N0 W . However, \u03b2(N\nis an increasing function of N and thus\nN\nN\ntotal density monotonically decreases with N if DS is used. Direct-sequence increases SINR by at most a factor\nof N , but this gain is offset by the fact that the SINR threshold increases at least linearly with N . As a result a DS\nsystem performs no better than an FDMA/FH system with N = 1, which corresponds to \u03bbT\u01eb (1) in (5) and which is\ngenerally much smaller than the optimal \u03bbT\u01eb (N \u2217 ). Although DS has strengths unrelated to spectral efficiency, such\nas security and MAC design [18], these benefits come at a significant performance penalty.\nB.

Because of the somewhat involved expression for outage probability, it is more convenient\nto consider bandwidth partitioning in terms of outage minimization rather than density maximization.

The relevant parameters are: W = 5 MHz, N0 = 10\u22126 , R = 1 Mbps,\nEb\n\u22122\n\u03bb = .01\n\u03c0 m , \u03b1 = 4. The jitter in the curves is due to simulation error. For sufficiently large N0 , the optimal\ndoes indeed converge to the optimal value for a purely interference-limited (N0 = 0) network. Furthermore, the\noptimizing N tends towards the Theorem 1 solution for more benign fading (Nakagami) and for smaller distance\nvariation.4 Based on (24), the truly optimal N seems to depend on the particular fading and distance distributions\nand appears somewhat intractable; further investigation is left for future work.\n\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nIn this work we studied the problem of bandwidth partitioning in a decentralized network and derived the optimal\noperating spectral efficiency, assuming multi-user interference is treated as noise and no transmission scheduling is\nperformed. A network can operate at this optimal point by dividing the total bandwidth into sub-bands sized such\nthat each transmission occurs on one of the sub-bands at precisely the optimal spectral efficiency.\nThe essence of this problem is determining the optimum balance between the time-frequency resources and area\nresources consumed by each transmission. Using many time-frequency resources to transmit a finite number of bits\ncorresponds to operating at a low spectral efficiency. This translates to a small required SINR, and thus only a small\narea must be free of interfering transmissions. On the other hand, using few time-frequency resources corresponds\nto a large spectral efficiency and in turn a large SINR and interferer-free area. Our analysis shows that the optimal\n4\nOur recent work has shown that there can be a substantial benefit to reducing variation in received signal power by adjusting transmit\npower to partially compensate for reduced signal power [19]; thus, systems with relatively small signal power variation are particularly\nrelevant.\n\n\f16\n\ndepends only on the path loss exponent and energy per information bit. If thermal noise is negligible the optimal\nspectral efficiency lies between the low- and high-SNR extremes, while in the power-limited regime the optimal\nis a fraction of the maximum possible spectral efficiency in the absence of interference. Furthermore, the optimal\nspectral efficiency is always an increasing function of the path loss exponent and of the energy per information bit.\nA PPENDIX I\nP ROOF OF T HEOREM 1\nIn order to prove the result it is convenient to work with natural logarithms:\n!2\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b1\n1\n1\n\u03ba\n1\n1\n11 \u03b1\nT\n\u03bb\u01eb (b) = \u03bab\n\u2212 Eb\n\u2212\n=\nn n\n= \u03bbT\u01eb (n)\n2b \u2212 1 b N\nloge 2\ne \u2212 1 n \u1ebc\n0\nEb\nN0\n\nIgnoring constant log\u03ba 2 and defining \u03b4 = \u03b12 , the first derivative is:\ne\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u03b4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0003\n1\n\u2212en\n1\n1\n1 \u03b4\u22121\nd \u0002 T\n1\n+ n\u03b4 n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb (n) =\n+\ndn \u01eb\nen \u2212 1 \u1ebcn\ne \u2212 1 \u1ebcn\n(en \u2212 1)2 \u1ebcn2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u03b4\u22121\n1\n1\nh\ni\n\u2212\nen \u22121\n\u1ebcn\nn\n \u0303 2 en \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) (en \u2212 1)2 .\n=\n\u1ebcn\n(e\n\u2212\n1)\n\u2212\nE\u03b4n\n\u1ebcn (en \u2212 1)2\n\nwhere n , b loge 2 and \u1ebc ,\n\n(25)\n\nloge 2 .\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nBecause the first term is positive for any n > 0, the derivative is equal to zero if and only if:\n \u0303 2 en \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) (en \u2212 1)2 = 0.\n\u1ebcn (en \u2212 1) \u2212 E\u03b4n\n\n(28)\n\nEb\nN0\n\nSubstituting n = b loge 2 and \u1ebc = log 2 yields the fixed point equation in (13).
