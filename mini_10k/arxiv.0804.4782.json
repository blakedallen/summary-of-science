This possibility is based\non the fact that the vacuum energy of fermions has a negative sign whereas that of bosons has a positive one. We\nnote that such an idea is realized in a highly constrained\nway in supersymmetric models, although supersymmetry\nbreaking must be present at probed energies in order to\nexplain observed data. Subsequently in a series of papers Zeldovich [3] connected the vacuum energy to the\ncosmological constant, however rather than eliminating\nthe divergences through a boson-fermion cancellation he\nsuggested a Pauli-Villars regularization of all divergences\nintroducing a spectrum of massive regulator fields. Covariant regularization of all contributions then leads to\nfinite values for both the energy density and (negative)\npressure corresponding to a cosmological constant.\nRather than use a regularization approach we shall\nassume that the actual particle content of a theory is\nsuch that U.V. divergences do not appear insofar bosons\nand fermions should compensate each other as Pauli suggested. Indeed we have previously examined [4] the problem of U.V. divergences of the vacuum energy for both\nMinkowski and de Sitter space-times and formulated the\nconditions for the cancellation of all divergences. These\nconditions lead to strong restrictions on the spectra of\npossible elementary particle models. In this note we shall\napply such considerations to the observed particles of the\nSM and also study the finite part of the vacuum energy\nand the possibility of a cancellation for this contribution\nalso, so as to obtain a result compatible with the observed value of the cosmological constant (almost zero\nwith respect to SM particle masses). The cancellation of\nall one-loop contributions to the cosmological and Newton constants was also considered in the context of the\ninduced gravity approach [5]. We shall instead consider\nEinstein gravity and obtain all constraints in Minkowski\n\nspace which is implicit if all contributions (divergent and\nfinite) compensate between fermions and bosons. Let us\nillustrate them in order.\nThe requirement that quartic divergences cancel is just\nthat the numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of\nfreedom be equal (NB = NF ). The conditions for the\ncancellation of quadratic and logarithmic divercences on\na flat Minkowski background are\nX\nX\nX\nm2s + 3\nm2V = 2\nm2F\n(1)\nand\n\nX\n\nm4s + 3\n\nX\n\nm4V = 2\n\nX\n\nm4F ,\n\n(2)\n\nrespectively. Here the subscripts s, V and F denote\nscalar, massive vector and massive spinor Majorana fields\nrespectively (for Dirac fields it is enough to put 4 instead\nof 2 on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (2)). For the\ncase of a de Sitter spacetime, equations giving conditions\nfor the cancellation of quadratic and logarithmic ultraviolet divergences are more involved. Some examples of\nthese conditions for simple particle physics models have\nbeen presented in Ref. [4].\nThe requirement that the finite part of the vacuum\nenergy (and pressure) also be very small compared with\nSM masses suggests that we also need a compensation\nbetween the finite parts of fermion and boson vacuum\nenergies, obtaining\nX\nX\nX\nm4s ln ms + 3\nm4V ln mV \u2212 2\nm4F ln mF = 0.\n(3)\nThis leads to a zero cosmological constant (Minkowski\nspace).\nAs is known the observed number of fermionic degrees\nof freedom in the Standard Model is much higher than\nthe number of bosonic degrees of freedom [6]. Indeed NF\nis equal to 96 (if we consider the neutrinos as massive\nparticles) while the number of bosonic degrees of freedom, carried by the photon, the gluons and the W \u00b1 and\n\n\f2\nZ 0 bosons is equal to 27. Thus we need an additional\n69 boson degrees of freedom, one of which is the Higgs\nboson. Ideally we would like to obtain some minimal extension of the Standard Model, which would not modify\nthe fermionic degrees of freedom while just adding hypothetical bosons.\nOur main result is a proof that, within the given framework, such an extension does not exist. In other words,\nwe show that on introducing new bosonic fields, which\nprovide the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergences in\nthe vacuum energy density, the finite part of the effective cosmological constant is always positive and of order\nof the mass of the top quark to the fourth power. This\nleads to the necessity of introducing new heavy fermions.\nIndeed we shall find explicit realizations with zero finite\nenergy once one introduces at least one fermion with a\nsuitable mass.\nFollowing a general analysis, for the sake of simplicity we shall consider an explicit minimal extension of the\nSM with a few massive bosons and weakly coupled, practically massless, others so as to satisfy the requirement\nNB = NF . Such a possibility is viable in effective action approaches and, for example, has been considered\nrecently in such scenarios as unparticle physics [7]. In this\nminimal framework we shall analyze the boson masses allowed by the cancellation constraints.\nIt is obvious that one may study vacuum energy in\nthe more modern and general setting [8] of effective actions, renormalization group flows, and even attempt to\ninclude the effects of condensates, however we feel that\nit is worthwhile to first examine the full consequences for\nSM physics of Pauli's original suggestion.\nIn next section we study the consequences of our equations for the SM particle spectrum and in the last section\nour results are summerized and discussed.\n\nII.\n\nTHE STANDARD MODEL AND VACUUM\nENERGY BALANCE\n\nLet us begin by observing that the mass of the top\nquark mt \u2248 170GeV is much higher than the masses\nof all other fermions (the bottom quark has the mass\nmb \u2248 4.5GeV while the mass of the heaviest \u03c4 -lepton is\nm\u03c4 \u2248 2GeV). Thus, on considering Eqs. (1), (2) and (3)\nwe can limit ourselves to only taking into account the contributions of the top quark, whose mass is conveniently\nused as the reference unit mass, and of the massive vector\nbosons. Then the mass of W \u00b1 bosons is mW \u2248 0.47mt\nwhile that of the Z 0 boson is mZ \u2248 0.53mt, with mt = 1.\nQuantities describing the contributions of the heavy\nfermion and boson degrees of freedom in the conditions\n(1), (2) and (3) are then:\nR2 \u2261 12m4t \u2212 6m4W \u2212 3m4Z \u2248 11.5,\n\n(4)\n\nh \u2261 12m2t \u2212 6m2W \u2212 3m4Z \u2248 9.83,\n\n(5)\n\nL \u2261 12m4t ln m2t \u22126m4W ln m2W \u22123m4Z ln m2Z \u2248 0.743. (6)\nIf we denote the masses squared of some hypothetic\nmassive boson fields by x1 , x2 , . . . , xn (xi > 0, \u2200i) then\ntheir values should satisfy the conditions\nn\nX\n\nx2i = R2 ,\n\nn\nX\n\nxi = h,\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\nx2i ln xi \u2261 \u03c6 = L . (7)\n\nWe shall now proceed as follows:\n- Firstly we shall find a lower bound to the number\nof massive boson degrees of freedom due to the first two\nconstraints in (7), which define a surface S in the space\nof the xi ;\n- Secondly we shall study on S, for positive xi , the extrema of the function \u03c6 by using the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers;\n- Finally we shall obtain for \u03c6, which is tipically larger\nthan L on S, its minimum (and maximum) value as a\nfunction of the SM particle content plus possible additional fermions in order to investigate the conditions for\nthe satisfaction of the last constraint in (7).\nThe first two conditions in (7) have a simple geometrical sense [4]: they describe a sphere and a plane in the\nn-dimensional space and their intersection S is an (n\u22122)dimensional sphere, eventually to be sliced on the positivity boundary of the xi . The distance\n\u221a of the plane from\nthe origin of the coordinates is h/ n. In order to have\nan intersection between the sphere of radius R and the\nplane it is then necessary to have\nn>\n\nh2\n\u2248 8.4.\nR2\n\n(8)\n\nThus, the number of massive bosonic degrees of freedom\nshould at least be equal to 9. In general it is convenient\nto introduce the integer value n0 for such a threshold\n\u0016 2\n\u0017\nh\nn0 =\n+1 ,\n(9)\nR2\nso that n \u2265 n0 is the requirement to have a non empty S.\nNow, in order to see when the last eq. in (7) is also satisfied, it is convenient\nPn to calculate the minimum value of\nthe function \u03c6 = i=1 x2i ln xi on the constraint surface\nS. Let us consider an auxiliary function\n!\n!\nn\nn\nn\nX\nX\nX\n2\n2\n2\nxi \u2212 h ,\nxi \u2212 R \u2212\u03bc\nxi ln xi \u2212\u03bb\nF ({xi }) =\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n(10)\nwhere \u03bb and \u03bc are the Lagrange multipliers. Searching for the extrema of the function F implies we should\nequate its derivatives with respect to xi , \u03bb and \u03bc to zero.\nThe last two conditions \u2202F/\u2202\u03bb and \u2202F/\u2202\u03bc again give the\nfirst two constraints in (7). Differentiation with respect\nto xi gives the system of equations:\nx2i ln xi \u2212 xi \u2212 2\u03bbxi \u2212 \u03bc = 0, i = 1, * * * , n.\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nWithout loss of generality we can choose x1 6= x2 . Indeed\nit is possible to have x1 = * * * = xn if and only if h2 /n2 =\nR2 , but this is a degenerate case, when the sphere and\nplane touch each other in only one point.\nOn substituting the values of x1 and x2 into the first\ntwo equations of the system (11), one obtains \u03bb\u0304 and \u03bc\u0304 as\nfunctions of x1 and x2 :\nx1 ln x21 \u2212 x2 ln x22\n,\nx1 \u2212 x2\n\nx1 x2 (ln x22 \u2212 ln x21 )\n.\nx1 \u2212 x2\n(12)\nLet us suppose that x\u03041 , * * * , x\u0304n , \u03bb\u0304, \u03bc\u0304 are a solution of\nthe system (11) on S, i.e. with the first two Eqs in (7)\nalready satisfied. On now substituting these values of \u03bb\u0304\nand \u03bc\u0304 into the n \u2212 2 remaining equations of the system\n(11) we can easily see that a solution is given by x1 =\nx3 = x4 = * * * = xk+1 and x2 = xn = xn\u22121 = * * * = xk+2 .\nThis solution is a stationary point of the function F , or\nin other words the conditional stationary point of the\nfunction \u03c6. Such a solution, with k coordinates having\nthe value x\u03041 = x and the remaining n \u2212 k coordinates the\nother value x\u03042 = y, is given, as function of k and n, by\nr\nh\nR2 (n \u2212 k) h2 (n \u2212 k)\nx = x(k, n) = +\n\u2212\n, (13)\nn\nnk\nn2 k\n\u03bb\u0304 = 1 +\n\nh\ny = y(k, n) = \u2212\nn\n\ns\n\n\u03bc\u0304 =\n\nh2 k\nR2 k\n\u2212 2\n,\nn(n \u2212 k) n (n \u2212 k)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nThe values of x given by Eq. (13) are always positive,\nwhile the values of y can be negative. It is easy to show\nthat the condition for the positivity of y is\nk < n0 \u2264 n .\n\n(15)\n\nWe have seen that points of the type described above\nalways satisfy the stationarity conditions (11) on the\nconstraint surface. This does not mean that stationary\npoints of other types cannot exist. Indeed, the analysis of\nthe structure of Eq. (11) shows (see for details [9]) that,\nin principle, stationary points whose coordinates xi have\nthree different values can exist. However, if such points\nexist, at least one of these three values is negative and,\nhence, is of no interest to us. Thus, the minimum of the\nfunction \u03c6 can be reached only for the stationary points\nhaving the coordinates (13), (14) or on the boundary of\nthe positivity region, where at least one of the coordinates xi is equal to zero. For this last case the problem\nis reduced to one with lower dimensionality n.\nIf n = n0 (the smallest possible value for the dimensionality of n) we notice that on the surface S all the\nxi have positive values. Thus, the maximum and minimum values of the function \u03c6 on the constraint surface\nare obtained only for one of the pairs of points with the\ncoordinates x and y (see formulae (13), (14)).\nFurthermore the following more general statement is\ntrue: for n \u2265 n0 the maximum value of the function \u03c6\n\ncorresponds to n = n0 and k = 1 while its minimum value\ncorresponds to the point with n = n0 and k = n0 \u2212 1. To\nprove it one may compute the derivatives of the function\n\u03c61 (k, n) = k x2 ln x + (n \u2212 k) y 2 ln y,\n\n(16)\n\nwith respect to k and n. It can be shown [9] that\nd\u03c61 /dk < 0 and d\u03c61 /dn > 0 for the range of possibile\nphysical values of k and n. In particular this means that\nthe function \u03c61 (k, n) decreases with increasing k and has\nits minimum value at k = n0 \u2212 1 and n = n0 . This\nminimum value is\n\u03c61 min = \u03c6\u03041 (R, h) = (n0 \u2212 1)x2 (n0 \u2212 1, n0 ) ln x(n0 \u2212 1, n0 )\n+y 2 (n0 \u2212 1, n0 ) ln y(n0 \u2212 1, n0 ) (17)\nwhere one has to use Eqs. (9), (13) and (14). The solution of the equation\nn\nX\n\nx2i ln xi = L\n\n(18)\n\ni=1\n\nexists on the constraint surface S only if\n\u03c6\u03041 (R, h) < L.\n\n(19)\n\nA direct calculation shows that for n0 = 9, \u03c61 min \u2248 1.95\nwhich is higher than L \u2248 0.743 in Eq. (6). For n > n0 the\nminimum value of the function \u03c61 is higher, so our first\nresult is that it is not possible to have the cancellations\nin an extension of the SM obtained on only introducing\nnew bosonic fields.\nLet us now consider an extension which includes new\nfermionic fields with masses mf in units of top mass and\nnf degrees of freedom.

In general the lower bound for\nn slightly increases from n0 depending on nf and mf .\nIn the simplest case with only one additional fermion we\nalready find solutions. Let us here give the results for\nthree interesting cases and a non physical (nf \u2192 \u221e)\ncase:\nMajorana : nf = 2, mf > 1.52\nDirac : nf = 4, mf > 1.46\nDirac quark (3 colors) : nf = 12, mf \u2208 [0.3536, 0.3592] \u222a\n[0.4, 0.655] \u222a [0.6892, 0.6914] \u222a [1.4, \u221e[\n1\nnf \u2192 \u221e , mf \u2208 [ \u221a , 0.853] \u222a [1.355, \u221e[\n(21)\nnf\n\n\f4\nMore possibilities are allowed if one introduces more\nfermionic fields with different masses.\nWe finally investigated a simple extension of the SM\nobtained on introducing a Majorana fermion and assuming for the bosonic sector n \u226a NB , so that most of the\nbosons are practically massless and weakly coupled, as\nin the unparticle scenario mentioned near the end of the\nprevious section. We found, as a function of the Majorana fermion mass, sets of solutions for the massive\nbosons (we consider the case n = 10). Of particular interest is the lightest boson mass which could play the\nrole of the Higgs mass. In such a case we find for it\nthe allowed mass intervals (in GeV): [111, 139], [115, 172],\n[112, 178] and [86, 177] for m2f = 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 m2t respectively. These are solutions compatible with the actual Higgs mass limits [6].\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have proved that it is impossible to construct a\nminimal extension of the SM by finding a set of boson\nfields which, besides cancelling the ultraviolet divergencies, can compensate the residual huge contribution of\nthe known fermionic and bosonic fields of the Standard\nModel to the finite part of the vacuum energy density.\nOn the other hand we have found that the addition of\nat least one massive fermionic field is sufficient for the\nexistence of a suitable set of boson fields which would\npermit the cancellations and we have obtained the allowed windows for the masses. This result is by itself\nvery suggestive since in extensions of the SM often new\nextra fermions are considered, independently of any cancellation requirement. An example is the explanation\nby a see-saw mechanism of the smallness of the neutrino\nmasses, which requires the presence of high mass Majorana neutrinos.\n\n[1] W.

If the fermion belongs to a new quark family, new mass windows appear (see (21)) with a range of\nvalues lower than the top quark mass, implying that this\nlow mass family should be weakly coupled. Furthermore\nwe have investigated numerically the simplest extensions\nof the SM which satisfy the constraints and found that\nthe lightest massive boson can have a mass compatible\nwith the bounds on the Higgs boson mass.\nThe problem we have addressed could also be studied\nin the context of renormalized effective actions wherein\nall parameters are running, including the cosmological\nconstant as well as the field masses. Further the cosmological constant may also be affected by the presence\nof condensates which we do not consider in our analysis. Another point we feel is important, but not understood, is a finite vacuum energy contribution due to the\npresence of bound states, originating from interactions,\nwhose conceptual distinction from fundamental particles\nmay not appear obvious when one is trying to give an\neffective formulation at different scales. This is a typical feature of interacting quantum field theories wherein\n\"fundamental\" degrees of freedom appear to be different\nfor different scales, one example being given by strong interaction physics. Again we believe that the most promising approach is given by a RG flow of effective actions.\nIn this sense our results are only a first step in a more\ngeneral scheme, which also takes into account any form\nof interaction.\nNonetheless our results, which are compatible with the\npresent data, are encouraging since they suggest that reasonable non supersymmetric extensions of the SM with\nalmost zero vacuum energy may exist.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to G.E.
