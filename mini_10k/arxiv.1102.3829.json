One of the leading mechanisms for such a SN is the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf when its\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nmass reaches a critical value via accretion from a normal stellar companion in a binary,\nwhich is called the single-degenerate scenario (Whelan & Iben 1973; Wheeler et al. 1975;\nNomoto 1982; Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000). This scenario is supported by the possible\nidentification of the survived stellar companion of the Ia SN observed by Tycho Brahe in\n1572 (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a), although little is yet known about the putative progenitor binary. A specific prediction of the single-degenerate scenario is that up to 0.5 solar\nmass can be stripped by the impact of Ia SN from its companion star (Wheeler et al. 1975;\nFryxell & Arnett 1981; Taam & Fryxell 1984; Chugaj 1986; Marietta et al. 2000; Meng et al.\n2007). So far, however, no direct observational evidence for the stripped envelope has been\nreported; only an upper limit of 0.01 solar mass has been set for two extragalactic Ia SNe\n(Leonard 2007). In comparison, stellar remnants are expected to be completely dispersed\nif a SN is due to the merger of two white dwarfs (the double-degenerate scenario; Iben &\nTutukov 1984; Whelan & Iben 1973).\nWe select the Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) to search for the stripped material\nmotivated by the detection of its candidate companion star (Tycho G, a G0-G2 type subgiant), which shows a large peculiar velocity (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a; Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\n2009). This remnant is one of the two identified Galactic type Ia SNRs, as revealed by the\nlight curve, radio emission, and X-ray spectra (Baade 1945; Baldwin 1957; Hughes 1995;\nRuiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a). It is young (437 years), nearby (3\u00b11 kpc; de Vaucouleurs 1985),\nand of high X-ray brightness (Cassam-Chena\u0131\u0308 et al. 2007). With the available deep observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), this remnant is an ideal laboratory to\nsearch for the stripped mass entrained in the ejecta.\n\n2.\n\nObservation and Data Reduction\n\nTable 1 lists the 12 CXO observations of the Tycho SNR used in this study. These\nobservations were carried out by the ACIS-I, the imagine array of the Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS), with a field of view large enough to cover the whole remnant. The\ndata were calibrated with the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO V4.1)\nsoftware package following the standard procedure to correct for charge-transfer inefficiency\n(CTI) effects and the time-dependence of the gain, to clean bad pixels, and to remove time\nintervals of background flares. The final total effective exposure for these observations is a\nlittle bit longer than 1 Ms.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nFig. 1 shows the intensity images of the remnant in different energy bands. In the 4-6\nkeV band image (Fig. 1 (a)), which is dominated by non-thermal X-ray emission sensitive to\nshocks, which accelerate particles, there appears an intriguing arc (as marked in the figure),\nonly about half way from the SN site (RA (2000) =00:25:23.8; DEC (2000) =64:08:04.7;\nRuiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a) and is as bright, narrow, and sharp as those filaments at the\nouter boundaries of the remnant. This unusual arc was first noticed by Warren et al. (2005).\nThey suggested that it may still be part of the SNR rim seen in projection. In comparison,\nFigs. 1 (b), (c), and (d) show the remnant in 1.6-2.0, 2.2-2.6, and 6.2-6.8 keV energy bands,\nrepresenting the intensity distributions of Si, S, and Fe emission lines. We find that the\nFe K\u03b1 line emission is unusually faint in a cone just outside of the arc (in the direction\naway from the SN site) , in comparison with the other regions beyond the same radius. The\nopening angle of this cone (about 20\u25e6 ) is similar to that of the arc relative to the SN site.\nIn the same cone, especially at the outer rims of the SNR, the 4-6 keV continuum emission\nas well as the Si and S line intensities also appear to be relatively deficient, though not as\nobvious as in the Fe K\u03b1 band. These relative intensity contrasts are shown quantitatively in\nFig. 2 (a). On the other hand, Fig 2(b) shows the same intensity contrasts for region within\nthe arc radius, where local peaks appear at nearly the same angular positions of the dips of\nthe profiles outside the arc. Observing the images we find that the enhancements are very\nclose to the arc. We interpret the intensity deficiency in the cone outside the arc and the\nlocal enhancements inside the arc as the blocking of the SN ejecta by the arc.\nThe spectrum of the arc is shown in Fig 3. The on-source spectrum is extracted from\nthe region defined by the inner polygon in Fig. 1(a), while the background is from the region\nbetween the inner and outer polygons. Fig 3 shows obvious dips at the positions of the Si,\nS and Fe lines in the source spectrum obtained. Since the background thermal emission\ndominates the nonthermal emission at these energies, these dips are probably due to the\nclumpy distribution of the SN ejecta and so highly variable background thermal emission\nsurrounding the arc. Fitting the source spectrum with a power law model gives a photon\nindex of 2.45\u00b10.09 (90% confidence errors), an absorption column density of (8.7\u00b10.9)\u00d71021\ncm\u22122 , an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of 7.8\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and \u03c72 of 291 for 200 degrees\nof freedom. If we ignore the data in 1.6-2.0, 2.2-2.6 and 6.0-7.0 keV, which are probably\neffected by the over-subtraction of the background line emission, the fitted parameters are\n+1.4\n21\nthen photon index 2.47+0.16\ncm\u22122 , and unabsorbed\n\u22120.08 , absorption column density 9.0\u22120.7 \u00d710\n0.5-10 keV flux 8.4\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , as well as a significantly improved \u03c72 of 176 for 171\ndegrees of freedom. Therefore, we conclude that the arc is nonthermal.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n4.\n\nThe nature and origin of the X-ray arc\n\nWe find that the X-ray arc is most probably in the interior of the SNR instead of a\n(morphologically) unusual feature of the outer rim projected well inside the remnant. The\nsharp and bright appearance of the X-ray arc is similar to those of the filaments at the outer\nrim of the SNR (Cassam-Chena\u0131\u0308 et al. 2007), implying that the arc is observed almost edge\non. If it is in the out layer of the SNR and the observed small angular distance from the\ngeometric centre is due to the projection effect, then the arc should be much more diffuse as\nit is observed half face on. In the 4-6 keV map, there exist some relatively bright features\nwithin the blast wave boundary. However, most of them are substantially more diffuse and\ncoincide with bright thermal structures spatially, and none of them is as far away from the\nboundary as the arc is (see also Warren et al. 2005). The arc is convexed toward the SN site,\nwhich is opposite to those of the filaments at the outer boundary. Furthermore, larger and\nfainter filaments tend to run northward from the southeast (Warren et al. 2005) and bent\noutward. The morphology of the arc can be naturally produced by the interaction between\nthe SN ejecta and a cloud. As will be discussed in the following, the arc most probably\nrepresents the materials stripped from the companion star by the SN explosion and is in the\ninterior of the SNR.\nFirst, the arc must be related to the progenitor system of the SN. If it is not related to the\nprogenitor system, it should then represent a dense cold molecular cloud that has survived\nfor long time. Actually, the milli-meter and optical observations suggest that the Tycho\nSNR is possibly interacting with molecular clouds at the northeastern and the southwestern\nrims (Lee et al. 2004; Ghavamian et al. 2000). These regions show strong 4-6 keV emission.\nHowever, neither CO nor optical emission enhancement has been detected to be spatially\ncoincident with the X-ray arc. It is unlikely to be a molecular cloud.\nSecond, the arc cannot arise from the materials ejected by the progenitor binary system\nof the SN. Since the mass donor is suggested to be very similar to the Sun but a slightly\nevolved one (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004), we don't expect that it could contribute to the\ncloud (e.g., via a stellar wind). One might think that a planetary nebula surrounding the\nexploded white dwarf could be a source of the cloud material. However, planetary nebulae\nalways show a spherically or axially symmetric morphology. The singleness of the X-ray arc\nmakes this possibility very unlikely.\nFinally, and most probably, the matter generating the X-ray arc is stripped from the\ncompanion star during the SN explosion. Such a mechanism has been suggested by many\ntheoretical works (Wheeler et al. 1975; Fryxell & Arnett 1981; Taam & Fryxell 1984; Chugai\n1986; Marietta et al. 2000; Meng et al. 2007) although no direct observational evidence is\ncurrently available (Leonard 2004). Arguments for this mechanism are as follows: (1) The\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nstripped materials are confined in a small angular range, which can naturally explain the\nsingleness of the arc; (2) The opening angle (about 20\u25e6 ) of the arc relative to the SN site\n(Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004), the absence of the X-ray line emission in the cone away from\nthe arc, and the local enhancements of X-ray emission immediately within the arc radius\nare all well consistent with the ejecta blocking scenario of the stripped stellar envelope\n(Marietta et al. 2000); (3) The gas in the envelope of the companion star is expected to\nhave a temperature of a few 103 K, it can not cool down to the CO emitting temperature\nin 400 years, especially in a hot environment; (4) The impact of the SN blast wave and\nejecta on the stripped envelope will generate a shock wave, just like those represented by\nthe nonthermal X-ray filaments at the outer rim, but with a smaller velocity because the\nenvelope is denser than the surrounding ISM. The shock wave can accelerate electrons to\nemit the nonthermal X-rays. (5) The angle between the direction of the arc to the explosive\ncentre and the proper motion velocity of Tycho G is well consistent with the theoretical\npredictions and simulations (Marietta et al. 2000; Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004; Meng et al.\n2007), as detailed in the following.\n\n5.\n\nConstraints on the progenitor binary system\n\nThe above interpretation together with the existing measurement of the companion's\npresent velocity gives tight constraints on properties of the progenitor binary of Tycho SN\n(see Fig. 4 for an illustration). Because of the SN impact, the companion star should receive\na kick as well as the envelope stripping in the same direction and in the orbital plane of\nthe progenitor binary. The direction should be perpendicular to the orbiting velocity of\nthe companion as it is expected to be in a circular orbit just before the SN (Marietta et al.\n2000; Meng et al. 2007). For Tycho G, the measured radial velocity is -50\u00b110 km s\u22121 [with\nthe projected Galactic rotation contribution (-30\u00b110 km s\u22121 ) subtracted; Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\n2009], while the tangential one is -94\u00b127 km s\u22121 (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a). Taking the\nuncertainty in the distance (3\u00b11 kpc; de Vaucouleurs 1985) into account, the tangential\nvelocity is -94\u00b141 km s\u22121 . The projected angle between the stripping direction and the\ncurrent velocity of Tycho G relative to the SN site is \u03b1=63\u00b113\u25e6 , where the error accounts\nfor the uncertainties in both the proper motion measurement and the arc/shadow central\nline (about 2\u25e6 ). Because the X-ray arc/shadow is viewed almost edge on (with an assumed\nuncertainty of 10\u25e6 ), the stripped velocity should be nearly perpendicular to the line of sight.\nTherefore, the real angle between the stripping (or the kick) and the velocity of Tycho G is \u03b2\n=67\u00b116\u25e6 .

(2000) shows that the ratio between the\norbital velocity and kick velocity is from 2.3 to 11.2, and so the real angle between the kick\nand the space velocity of the stellar remnant is between 67\u25e6 to 85\u25e6 . Our result is consistent\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwith these predictions.\nWe can then infer that the companion had an orbital velocity (Vo ) of 98\u00b136 km s\u22121 in the\nprogenitor binary, received a kick velocity (vk ) of 42\u00b130 km s\u22121 , and the inclination angle of\nthe orbital plane is 31\u00b113\u25e6 . We can also constrain the separation between the two stars in the\nM12 G\nprogenitor binary with the formula a = (M1 +M\n2 , where M1 is the mass of the SN progenitor\n2 )Vo\nand is assumed to be 1.4 solar mass - the Chandrasekhar mass of a white dwarf, M2 the\nmass of the companion star, and G the gravitational constant. Tycho G is similar to the Sun\nspectroscopically (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a; Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2009) and thus has a mass\nof about one solar or slightly higher (depending on the luminosity type; see below). We then\n1\nestimate a = 2.4+\u03b5\n(2.7 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 107 km, where \u03b5 is the mass stripped from the companion and\nshould be considerably smaller than one, hence negligible. The corresponding orbital period\nis then 4.9+5.3\n\u22123.0 days. These orbital parameters and kick velocity are summarized in Table 2.\nThey are well consistent with the theoretical predictions (Marietta et al. 2000; Meng et al.\n2007). Pakmor et al. (2008) simulated the impact of type Ia SN on main sequence binary\ncompanions. They find that the kick velocity of the companion star after the impact of the\nSN ejecta varies from 17 to 61 km s\u22121 for different models. Our results are also consistent\nwith their simulations.\nWe may also check the evolutionary state of the companion, assuming that it filled the\nRoche lobe when the SN took place. Because the Roche lobe radius is (Paczynski 1971)\n1\n)] \u00d7 [ 2.4+\u03b5\n(2.7 \u00b1 2.0)] \u00d7 107 \u2248 (4.0 \u00b1 2.7) \u00d7 106 km, about 5.7 times\nrr = [0.38 + 0.2 log( 1+\u03b5\n1.4\nthe solar radius, the companion should be a subgiant, fully consistent with the luminosity\nclassification of Tycho G Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004a) and Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2009).\nThe angular size (about 20\u25e6 ) of the X-ray arc relative to the SN site is smaller than\nthat subtended by the Roche lobe (40\u25e6 ), which may be expected from the compression and\nstripping of the envelope in the bow-shocked SN ejecta material (Fig. 4). The angular\nseparation between the SN site and the arc is about half of the outer radius of the remnant, which presumably reflects the difference in their velocities. A type Ia SN explosion\nreleases a typical kinetic energy of (1-1.4)\u00d71051 erg, and the mean ejecta velocity (vej ) for a\nChandrasekhar mass of 1.4 M\u2299 is 8500-10000 km s\u22121 . The momentum conservation for the\nstripped mass (Mstr ), the kicked companion star, and the ejecta in the solid angle subtended\nv\nby the envelope can be expressed as: Mej vej =(Mej +Mstr ) 2ej +Mc vk . Assuming a spherically\nsymmetric SN and using a companion star mass of 1 solar, an ejecta velocity of 9230 km s\u22121 ,\nand vk =42 km s\u22121 ,as well as the 20\u25e6 wide solid angle, we estimate the mass of the envelope\nto be 0.0016 M\u2299. Taking the uncertainty of vk (\u00b130 km s\u22121 ) into account, the upper limit of\nthe stripped mass is 0.0083 M\u2299 . The mass outside the assumed solid angle (e.g., to account\nfor the full Roche lobe) should be negligible because of the expected highly-concentrated ra-\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndial mass profile of a subgiant star (Meng et al. 2007). This estimation of the stripped mass\nis consistent with that observed for two extragalactic Ia SNe (Leonard 2007), significantly\nlower than the theoretical predictions by Marrieta et al. (2000) and Meng et al. (2007), and\nis close to (though still lower than) 1 to several percent that simulated by Pakmor et al.\n(2008).\nAlthough the stripped mass is small, it is enough to produce the X-ray arc. Katsuda\net al. (2010) estimated that the mean ambient density of Tycho's SNR is 0.0015 cm\u22123 , or\n<0.2 cm\u22123 . The mass of the ambient ISM in a cone of 20\u25e6 radius should then be about\n4\u00d710\u22125 M\u2299 , or < 5\u00d710\u22123 M\u2299 , smaller than or at most comparable to the stripped mass.\nSince bright nonthermal filaments have been observed all along the rim of the remnant (e.g.,\nCassam-Chenai et al. 2007), the interaction between SN ejecta (probably denser at the arc\nposition) and the stripped mass should be strong enough to be responsible of the X-ray arc\nemission.\nRecently, Kerzendorf et al. (2009) have reported the new space velocity and mass\nmeasurements of Tycho G, which are different from those by Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004a).\nWe list the new measurements and the corresponding binary parameters in Table 2. The\nnew orbital radius and period are several times as those derived from Ruiz-Lapuente et al.\n(2004a) and Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2009). The angle between the kick and the space velocity\nof the stellar remnant is therefore about 82 degrees, only marginally consistent with the\nnumerical simulations (Marietta et al. 2000). In the scheme of momentum conservation,\nthe amount of the stripped mass is derived as 0.0087\u00b10.0017 M\u2299 . It is higher than that\nfrom Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004a) and Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2009), but still consistent with the\nsimulations by Pakmor et al. (2008) and the observations by Leonard (2007).\nAs pointed out by Kerzendorf et al. (2009), there is a simple relationship between the\n2\ncompanion's rotation velocity (vrot ) and its orbital velocity (vorb,2 ): vrot = M1M+M\nf (q)Vorb,2 ,\n1\nwhere f (q) is the ratio of the companion's Roche-lobe radius to the orbital separation and\nq = M1 /M2 is the mass ratio of the primary to the companion at the time of the explosion. If\nM2 is 0.3-0.5 M\u2299 (Kerzendorf et al. 2009), vrot of the companion's surface should be about\n24 km s\u22121 , much higher than 7.5 km s\u22121 , the upper limit of Tycho G's rotation velocity\n(vrot sini ), where i is the inclination angle of the the orbital velocity. Using the inclination\nangle that we obtained in this paper, the upper limit of vrot for Tycho G is about 10 km\ns\u22121 , still significantly lower than 24 km s\u22121 . Kerzendorf et al. (2009) proposed that a red\ngiant scenario where the envelope's bloating has significantly decreased the rotation could\nbe consistent with their observation of the low rotation velocity. Since the effect of the\ninclination angle is small, Tycho G remains a stripped giant if it is the mass donor, as\nsuggested by Kerzendorf et al. (2009).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIf the companion is about 1 M\u2299 , its surface velocity was about 60 km s\u22121 at the SN\nexplosion, as derived from the binary parameters listed in Table 2 and that it filled the Roche\nlobe, which has a radius of about 5.7 R\u2299 . However, the companion may have a radius of\n1-3 R\u2299 now (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a; Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2009), and so the surface velocity\nof the stellar remnant should be about 10-31 km s\u22121 , marginally consistent with the upper\nlimit of vrot observed by Kerzendorf et al. (2009) and the inclination angle that we obtained.\nWe speculate that the decrease of the radius is possibly due to the destruction of the white\ndwarf. Before the SN explosion, the strong radiation of the accreting white dwarf inflated the\nenvelope of the companion star to fill the Roche-lobe, and the radius of the companion star\nshrinks to 1-3 R\u2299 now because the heating of the white dwarf does not exist. In addition, we\nnote here that the shrink did not accelerate the rotation significantly, because the inflated\nenvelope only contributes a small fraction of the total mass of the companion star and most\nof it was stripped away by the SN.\nUsing the position of the arc and the age of the remnant, we obtained a mean velocity of\nthe arc outward from the SN site as about 0.\u2032\u2032 28 yr\u22121 . As measured by Katsuda et al. (2010),\nthe Tycho's remnant is expanding at a proper motion velocity around 0.\u2032\u2032 3 yr\u22121 , in contrast\nto the mean expansion speed of about 0.\u2032\u2032 55 yr\u22121 from the radius and age of the remnant.\nThis shows that the remnant are in a deceleration phase due to the interaction with the ISM.\nIf the arc is a projected feature that is in the outer layer of the remnant, it should have a\nproper motion velocity of \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 15 yr\u22121 . If the arc is actually about half way from the SN site\nand represents the interaction of the SN explosion and the stripped companion envelope, the\nproper motion should be quite close to the mean velocity \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 28 yr\u22121 , as discussed below.\nOn one hand, the arc is unlikely in an accelerating phase. The binary separation is tiny\ncompared to the distance of the X-ray arc from the SN site. Even the Fe ejecta, which is\nexpected to have the lowest velocity and was measured as \u223c 3000 km s\u22121 currently (Furuzawa\net al. 2009), can pass such a separation within several hours. Most of the impact of the ejecta\non the companion envelope (and thus the acceleration of the stripped mass) should take place\nsoon after the explosion. On the other hand, the arc can not be significantly decelerated.\nSince the distance of the X-ray arc from the SN site is about half of the remnant radius,\nusing the ISM density given by Katsuda et al. (2010), the ISM mass in the cone between\nthe SN site and the X-ray arc is \u223c5\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 , much smaller than the stripped envelope\nmass. Although the ISM decelerates the motion of the stripped envelope material, it is\nquite insignificant given the small mass. Therefore, the stripped envelope went through a\nvery short accelerating phase in the beginning of the SN explosion, and has remained in an\nalmost free expansion state since then.\nWe have attempted to measure the proper motion of the X-ray arc so as to check the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nabove scenario, since the expected proper motion may be detectable at Chandra's resolution.\nUnfortunately, the arc typically fallen more or less at a gap between two ACIS-I chips,\nespecially in three early observations. In addition, the arc is heavily contaminated by strong\nthermal emission in the low energy band. In 4-6 keV, where nonthermal emission dominates,\nthe counting statistics of the arc are typically not sufficient in early observations. As a\nresult, we cannot yet get a reliable multi-epoch measurements of the arc positions to allow\nfor a reliable determination of the proper motion. Future observations with more careful\npositioning of the arc in the detector and with a total exposure time comparable to the\nACIS-I observations in 2009 will make such measurements feasible.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have shown that a self-consistent single-degenerate binary model provides a natural\nand unified interpretation of the observed unique X-ray arc/shadow in the Tycho's SNR.\nTwo sets of parameters of the progenitor binary system have also been presented using\nthe optical observation results of the candidate companion star (Tycho G) obtained by\nRuiz-Lapuente et al. (2004a) and Kerzendorf et al. (2009) respectively. The main points in\nfavor of our interpretation are: (1) Although the nonthermal X-ray arc is half way from the\nremnant center, the high brightness show that it is viewed almost edge on and so unlikely a\nprojected feature in the outer layer of the remnant. Together with its sharp inward convex\nshape, the arc most probably represents the interaction between the ejecta and a bulk of\nmaterials in the interior of the remnant. (2) This bulk of materials can not be due to a preexisting molecular cloud or materials ejected by the progenitor binary system. The impact\ngenerating the X-ray arc is most likely between SN ejecta and the stripped envelop of the\ncompanion star. (3) The X-ray emission of the remnant shows an apparent shadow casted\nby the arc in the opposite direction of the explosion site, and there are local enhancements in\nthe same direction immediately within the X-ray arc, consistent with the blocking of the SN\nejecta by the envelope. (4) We obtained a stripped mass of \u2264 0.0083 M\u2299 , which is consistent\nwith that observed for two extragalactic Ia SNe (Leonard 2007) and close to the recent\nsimulations by Pakmor et al. (2008). (5) The angle between the motion of the companion\ncandidate and the direction of the arc as well as the derived kick velocity of the companion\nstar are well consistent with the theoretical predictions and the numerical simulation results.\nHowever, we note that there are still several points that can not be well interpreted\nby the current scenario, and further work is needed to reveal the physical processes related\nto the nonthermal X-ray arc. (1) The properties of Tycho G and whether it is the stellar\nremnant of Tycho's SN are under debate (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004a; Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2009;\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nKerzendorf et al. 2009). If Tycho G is not the stellar remnant, the binary parameters and\nkick velocity obtained in this paper are unreliable anymore. Also, if Tycho G is the stellar\nremnant but has properties as obtained by Kerzendorf et al. (2009), the obtained angle\nbetween the kick and the space velocity of the stellar remnant is only marginally consistent\nwith the numerical simulations (Marietta et al. 2000). (2) It has not been quantitatively\nestimated whether the interaction between the stripped envelope and the ejecta can produce\nshock wave strong enough to produce the nonthermal X-ray arc. (3) We failed to obtain a\nprecise proper motion of the X-ray arc, which is an important criterion to differentiate the\nX-ray arc as inside the remnant from a projected feature in the outer layer. Further studies\nof the stellar remnant as well as the measurement of the proper motion velocity of the X-ray\narc are therefore urged to check the validity of the scenario proposed in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the referee for many insightful comments and suggestions that helped us\ngreatly in the revision of the paper.
