We apply the method of Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii to prove\nthat for an exponentially generic (in the sense of Ol'shanskii) class of\none-relator groups the isomorphism problem is solvable in at most exponential time.\nThis is obtained as a corollary of the more general result that for any\nfixed integers m > 1, n > 0 there is an exponentially generic class of\nm-generator n-relator groups where every group has only one Nielsen\nequivalence class of m-tuples generating non-free subgroups. We also\nprove that all groups in this class are co-Hopfian.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe idea of genericity in the context of geometric group theory was introduced by Gromov [23] and formalized by Ol'shanskii [47] who rigorously\nproved that \"most\" finitely presented groups are word-hyperbolic (see also\nthe work of Champetier [11] for the two-relator case). The importance of\nprobabilistic considerations for the study of finitely presented groups is now\nbecoming increasingly clear, for example in the work of Gromov on \"random\" groups [24] and uniform embeddability into Hilbert spaces. See also\n[32, 33] for results on generic and average-case complexity of group-theoretic\ndecision problems. Since the book of Gromov [23] appeared, there have been\nquite a number of results about genericity of various group-theoretic properties [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 60, 62]. The basic philosophy is that\ngeneric behavior is often the best and the simplest possible. The results of\nthis paper are very much in this line.\nWe now recall the formal definition of genericity according to Ol'shanskii [6].\nNote that this definition is different from the definition used by Ol'shanskii\nin [47]. Roughly speaking, for fixed m and n, a property of m-generated\nn-related groups is \"generic\" if a \"randomly\" chosen such group satisfies\nthis property.\nConvention 1.1. Throughout this paper, given m, we fix a finite alphabet\nA = {a1 , . . . , am }, which will be the set of generators of the group G under\nconsideration. Let F denote the free group F (A) = F (a1 , . . . , am ) on A.

A reduced\nword w is said to be cyclically reduced if all cyclic permutations of w are\nreduced. The length of a word w, denoted |w|, is the number of letters in w.\nDefinition 1.2. [6] Let m > 1 and n > 0 be fixed integers and fix the\nalphabet A = {a1 , . . . , am }.\nLet P be a property of group presentations on A of the form\nha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i\nwhere the ri are cyclically reduced nontrivial words in F (A).\nFor any integer t \u2265 0 let N (m, n, t) be the number of all possible presentations of the form ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i where the ri are cyclically reduced nontrivial words from F (A) and where |ri | \u2264 t for i = 1, . . . , n. Let\nNP (m, n, t) be the number of presentations with these restrictions which\ndefine a group with property P .\nWe say that P is (m, n)-generic if\nNP (m, n, t)\n= 1.\nt\u2192\u221e N (m, n, t)\nlim\n\nIf, moreover, there is 0 \u2264 c = c(m, n) < 1 such that for all sufficiently large\nt we have\n1\u2212\n\nNP (m, n, t)\n\u2264 ct ,\nN (m, n, t)\n\nwe say that P is exponentially (m, n)-generic.\nFor the case n = 1 (one-relator groups) exponential genericity in the sense\nof Ol'shanskii coincides with Gromov's notion of exponential genericity [23,\n47].\nLet G be a group. Recall that the classical elementary Nielsen moves\non a tuple (g1 , . . . , gm ) \u2208 Gm are: replace some gi by gi\u22121 , or interchange\nsome gi and gj , or replace some gi by gi gj for some i 6= j. Two m-tuples\n\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 Gm are Nielsen-equivalent in G if there is a finite chain of elementary\nNielsen moves taking \u03c4 to \u03c4 \u2032 . Clearly Nielsen-equivalent tuples generate the\nsame subgroup of G. Another important basic fact is that in a free group of\nfinite rank F = F (x1 , . . . , xm ) (where m > 0) every generating m-tuple of\nF is Nielsen-equivalent to (x1 , . . . , xm ). This implies that for an arbitrary\n\u2032 ) are Nielsen-equivalent\ngroup G two m-tuples (g1 , . . . , gm ) and (g1\u2032 , . . . , gm\nin G if and only if there is \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(F (x1 , . . . , xm )), \u03b1(xi ) = Wi (x1 , . . . , xm )\nsuch that for i = 1, . . . , n we have gi\u2032 = Wi (g1 , . . . , gm ).\nThe following theorem states that for a generic class of one-relator groups\nthe isomorphism problem is solvable in at most exponential time. Moreover,\ngiven a one-relator presentation we can decide in exponential time if the\npresentation belongs to this generic class.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n3\n\nTheorem A. Let m > 1 be an integer. There exists an exponentially (m, 1)generic class Pm of one-relator presentations ha1 , . . . , am |ri with the following properties:\n(1) Every group G defined by a presentation from Pm is torsion-free,\none-ended and word-hyperbolic. Moreover, every subgroup of G generated by at most m \u2212 1 elements is free.\n(2) There is an algorithm which, given an arbitrary cyclically reduced\nword r \u2208 F (a1 , . . . , am ), decides in at most exponential time (in the\nlength of r) whether or not a presentation ha1 , . . . , am |ri belongs to\nPm .\n(3) For any presentation ha1 , . . . , am |ri from Pm , for the group G =\nha1 , . . . , am |ri any m-tuple, generating a non-free subgroup of G, is\nNielsen-equivalent in G to the m-tuple (a1 , . . . , am ).\n(4) Suppose G1 = ha1 , . . . , am |r1 i and G2 = ha1 , . . . , am |r2 i are onerelator presentations, at least one of which is in Pm . Then G1 is\nisomorphic to G2 if and only if there is \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(F (a1 , . . . , am ))\nsuch that either \u03b1(r1 ) = r2 or \u03b1(r1 ) = r2\u22121 .\n(5) There is an algorithm taking at most exponential time (in the sum\nof the lengths of the relators) which, given two m-generator onerelator presentations with at least one in Pm , decides if they define\nisomorphic groups.\nTheorem A is obtained as a corollary of the following more general statement:\nTheorem B. Let m > 1 and n > 0 be integers. There exists an exponentially (m, n)-generic class Pm,n of m-generator n-relator presentations\nha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i\nwith the following properties:\n(1) Every group defined by a presentation from Pm,n is torsion-free, oneended and word-hyperbolic. Moreover, every subgroup of G generated\nby at most m \u2212 1 elements is free.\n(2) There is an algorithm which, given an arbitrary m-tuple of cyclically reduced words r1 , . . . , rn \u2208 F (a1 , . . . , am ), decides in at most\nexponential time (in the sum of the length of ri ) whether or not a\npresentation ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i belongs to Pm,n .\n(3) For any presentation ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i from Pm,n , for the group\nG = ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i any m-tuple, generating a non-free subgroup of G, is Nielsen-equivalent in G to the m-tuple (a1 , . . . , am ).\nTheorem B implies that any automorphism of a generic group\nG = ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i\nfrom the class Pm,n is induced by an automorphism of F (a1 , . . . , am ). Moreover, G has only one m-generated non-free subgroup, namely G itself. This\nmeans, for example, that if H is another m-generated group and \u03c6 : H \u2192 G\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n4\n\nis a homomorphism then either \u03c6(H) = G or \u03c6(H) is free. In particular if\nG = H and \u03c6 : G \u2192 G is an injective endomorphism, then \u03c6 must be onto\n(since G is non-free), so that G is co-Hopfian. It is an important result of\nSela [56] that all one-ended torsion-free hyperbolic groups are co-Hopfian.\nAll groups covered by Theorem B are of this sort, but here we establish\nco-Hopficity for a generic class of finitely presented groups without using\nthe JSJ-decomposition theory or the R-tree techniques of Sela.\nTheorem A is a corollary of Theorem B:\nProof of Theorem A. Parts (1),(2),(3) of Theorem A follow directly from\nthe corresponding parts of Theorem B.\nWe say that an m-generator one-relator group has the Nielsen uniqueness\nproperty if this group has only one Nielsen equivalence class of generating\nm-tuples.\nClaim. For an m-generated one-relator group G = ha1 , . . . , am |ri with\nthe Nielsen equivalence property and for any other m-generated one-relator\ngroup H = ha1 , . . . , am |si the groups G and H are isomorphic if and only if\nthere is an automorphism of F (a1 , . . . , am ) taking s to either r or r \u22121 .\nThe last condition is clearly sufficient for G and H to be isomorphic.\nSuppose now that \u03c6 : H \u2192 G is an isomorphism. To avoid confusion, we\nre-label the generators of H and call them bi so that\nH = hb1 , . . . , bm |s(b1 , . . . , bm )i.\nDenote ci = \u03c6(bi ) for i = 1, . . . , m. The group G is identified with H via \u03c6\nand hence on the generators ci the group G has the presentation\n(\u2020)\n\nG = hc1 , . . . , cm |s(c1 , . . . , cm ) = 1i.\n\nSince G has the Nielsen uniqueness property, the m-tuple (c1 , . . . , cm ) is\nNielsen-equivalent to (a1 , . . . , am ) in G. Hence these tuples are related by\nan automorphism of F (a1 , . . . , am ). When we rewrite presentation (\u2020) of G\nin the generators (a1 , . . . , am ) using this automorphism, we conclude that for\nsome \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(F (a1 , . . . , am )) the elements r(a1 , . . . , am ) and \u03b1(s(a1 , . . . , am ))\nhave the same normal closure in F (a1 , . . . , am ). By a classical result of Magnus [40] this implies that \u03b1(s) is conjugate to r or r \u22121 in F (a1 , . . . , am ),\nyielding the Claim. This establishes part (4) of Theorem A.\nTo see that (5) holds recall that by a classical result of Whitehead [41] one\ncan decide in exponential time (in the sum of the lengths of the two words)\nwhether two elements of F (a1 , . . . , am ) are related by an automorphism.\nApplying this algorithm to the pairs (r, s) and (r \u22121 , s) yields the required\nresult.\n\u0003\nThe above algorithm also allows one to test the isomorphism of an arbitrary m-generator one-relator group and a group from a family of mgenerator one-relator groups with the Nielsen equivalence property.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n5\n\nIn terms of the paper [32] by Kapovich, Myasnikov, Schupp and Shpilrain\nTheorem A implies that the isomorphism problem for the class of all mgenerated one-relator group is solvable strongly generically in exponential\ntime. We refer the reader to [32] for the precise explanation of this terminology. We stress, however, that the above statement does not say that the\nisomorphism problem for m-generated one-relator groups is solvable. We\nalso wish to point out that parts (1) of Theorem A and Theorem B are due\nto Arzhantseva and Olshanskii [6, 2] and we only state them for completeness.\nThere are very few general positive results regarding solvability of the\nisomorphism problem in combinatorial group theory. A famous exception is\nthe remarkable theorem of Sela [56] asserting that the isomorphism problem\nis solvable in the class of torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups. One-relator\ngroups are generically hyperbolic and so Sela's theorem applies to generic\none-relator groups. However, besides using much more elementary considerations, the present theorem provides an explicit complexity bound for\nthe algorithm solving the isomorphism problem and provides an exponential algorithm to decide if a given one-relator presentation does or does not\nbelong to the generic class from Theorem A. Over the class of all finite\npresentations, there is no algorithm which decides if the group presented is\nword-hyperbolic since hyperbolicity is a Markov property. There is, however, a partial algorithm which eventually recognizes if a finitely presented\ngroup is hyperbolic [48]. It is still possible that hyperbolicity is decidable\nfor one-relator presentations and this is a very interesting open question (see\n[30]).\nThe isomorphism problem for the general class of one-relator groups is\nstill open. Pride [51] proved that the isomorphism problem is solvable for\ntwo-generator one-relator groups with torsion and Rosenberger [53, 54] established the same result for \"cyclically pinched one-relator groups\", that\nis for one-relator groups of the form F1 \u2217C F2 where F1 , F2 are free and C\nis infinite cyclic (see also [16, 61] for related work). The proofs of both\nRosenberger and Pride essentially established the uniqueness of the Nielsenequivalence class of generating tuples. This question of uniqueness has a\nlong history of its own. It was a conjecture of Magnus [39] that every mgenerator one-relator one-ended group has exactly one Nielsen equivalence\nclass of generating m-tuples. McCool and Pietrowski [43] provided the first\ncounter-example, where the number of Nielsen classes is bigger than one but\nfinite. Brunner [9] constructed a two-generator one-relator group with infinitely many Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs. Pride [49] gave\nan example of a small cancellation (and hence hyperbolic) two-generated\none-relator group where not every automorphism is \"freely induced\" and\nhence there is more than one Nielsen equivalence class of generating pairs.\nMoreover, it is possible to construct a two-generated infinitely related small\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n6\n\ncancellation group with infinitely many Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs [36]. Theorem A shows that, despite these important counterexamples, the conjecture of Magnus holds for an exponentially generic class\nof one-relator groups.\nOther previously known related facts include a theorem of Gromov and\nDelzant [23, 19] that a torsion-free hyperbolic group has only finitely many\n(up-to conjugation) Nielsen-equivalence classes of pairs of elements generating one-ended subgroups. In particular, if G is a two-generated torsion-free\none-ended hyperbolic group then it has only finitely many Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs. We refer the reader to [21, 22, 28] and the\nfurther references therein for other results of a similar nature.\nMoreover, Kapovich and Weidmann [38] proved that if G is a torsion-free\nhyperbolic group where all k-generated subgroups are quasiconvex, then G\nhas only finitely many (up to conjugation) Nielsen-equivalence classes of (k+\n1)-tuples generating one-ended subgroups. Arzhantseva [3] proved, in particular, that in a generic m-generated n-related group all (m \u2212 1)-generated\nsubgroups are quasiconvex (and free by the earlier result of ArzhantsevaOl'shanskii [6]). Hence the theorem of Kapovich-Weidmann already implied\nthat for a generic m-generated n-related group there are only finitely many\nNielsen equivalence classes of generating m-tuples.\nThe main ingredient of our proofs is a powerful graph minimization technique introduced by Ol'shanskii and Arzhantseva [6]. We believe that this\nmethod is applicable in a variety of situations and deserves to be much more\nwidely known and used. Their method is in many ways dual to the \"perimeter reduction\" technique of McCammond-Wise [8, 29, 42, 55]. Both methods\nallow one to study subgroups of non-free groups by means of Stallings subgroup graphs. Perimeter reduction reduces \"what is missing\" by filling in\nrelator cycles. To be able to use this method, McCammond and Wise introduced the idea of a \"distributive\" small cancellation hypothesis which\ninvolves how occurrences of the generators are distributed among the relators. The Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii minimization method reduces \"what is\npresent\" by cutting out \"large\" parts of relator cycles. Arzhantseva and\nOl'shanskii proposed a strong kind of \"genericity\" small cancellation condition adopted for groups with a given number of generators. We shall give a\nprecise definition of this condition later.\nThe minimization technique was introduced by Arzhantseva and\nOl'shanskii [6], where they used it to prove that for a generic m-generated\nn-related group all (m \u2212 1)-generated subgroups are free. It was later deployed by Arzhantseva [2, 3, 4] to study generic properties of finitely presented groups and subgroup properties of word-hyperbolic groups. (Results\nabout groups where all subgroups with a bounded number of generators\nare free, were also obtained by Bumagina [10]). An illustration of the two\ndifferent methods is provided by the work of Schupp [55] (using perimeter reduction) on subgroup separability of Coxeter groups and the paper of\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n7\n\nKapovich and Schupp [34] using minimization with a \"standard\" small cancellation hypothesis to obtain results regarding freeness and quasiconvexity\nof subgroups of Coxeter groups, Artin groups and one-relator groups with\ntorsion.\nWe now briefly describe the original idea of Arzhantseva-Olshanskii from\n[6]. Let G be a small cancellation group with \"good\" genericity properties\nand with a finite generating set A = {a1 , . . . , am }. If \u0393 is a finite graph with\nedges labeled by letters from A\u00b11 and base-vertex v0 , there is a canonical\nmap \u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393, v0 ) \u2192 G sending a loop at v0 to the element of G represented\nby its label. Every (m\u22121)-generated subgroup H of G can be represented as\nH = image(\u03c6) for at least one such graph \u0393 with rank(\u03c01 (\u0393)) \u2264 m \u2212 1 (for\nexample, a wedge of circles labeled by the generators of H). Among all such\n\u0393 representing H with rank(\u03c01 (\u0393)) \u2264 m \u2212 1 choose \u0393 with with minimal\ncomplexity in some appropriate sense. The small cancellation assumption\non G then implies that either \u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393, v0 ) \u2192 G is injective and hence H\nis free (the desired conclusion) or there is a reduced path in \u0393 labeled by a\nlarge portion w of a defining relator. Analysis of how this w is subdivided\nby maximal arcs of \u0393 allows Arzhantseva and Ol'shanskii to then perform a\nsurgery trick on \u0393 preserving the rank of its fundamental group as well as the\nsubgroup H = \u03c6(\u03c01 (\u0393, v0 )) \u2264 G but reducing the complexity of graph. This\nyields a contradiction with the minimal choice of \u0393. We refer the reader\nto the proof of Lemma 5.1 below for a more detailed discussion on the\nArzhantseva-Ol'shanskii method. In the present paper we make use of the\nfact [5] that both homotopy equivalence folding moves and the ArzhantsevaOl'shanskii surgery trick translate into chains of Nielsen moves on the level\nof the generating sets \u03c6(S) of H where S is a free basis of \u03c01 (\u0393, v0 ).\nThe authors are very grateful to Alexander Ol'shanskii and Goulnara\nArzhantseva for useful comments on the preliminary versions of the paper.\n2. Representing subgroups by labeled graphs\nConvention 2.1. From now on, unless specified otherwise, we fix m > 1,\nF = F (A) = F (a1 , . . . , am ) and a group G = F (A)/N , where N is a normal\nsubgroup of F .\nFollowing the approach of Stallings [58], we use labeled graphs to study\nfinitely generated subgroups of quotients of a free group.\nDefinition 2.2. An F -graph \u0393 consists of an underlying oriented graph\nwhere every edge e is labeled by a letter \u03bc(e) \u2208 A \u222a A\u22121 in such a way that\n\u03bc(e\u22121 ) = \u03bc(e)\u22121 for every edge e of \u0393. We allow multiple edges between\nvertices as well as edges which are loops.\nAn F -graph \u0393 is said to be non-folded if there exists a vertex v and two\ndistinct edges e1 , e2 with origin v such that \u03bc(e1 ) = \u03bc(e2 ). Otherwise \u0393 is\nsaid to be folded.\nEvery edge-path p in \u0393 has a label which is a word in A \u222a A\u22121 . We shall\ndenote this label by \u03bc(p). The number of edges in p will be called the length\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n8\n\nof p and denoted |p|. A path p in an F -graph \u0393 is said to be reduced if it\ndoes not contains subpaths of the form e, e\u22121 where e is an edge of \u0393. For a\npath p (e.g. an edge) we will denote the initial vertex of p by o(p) and the\nterminal vertex of p by t(p).\nThe following statement is obvious:\nLemma 2.3. Let \u0393 be an F -graph. Then \u0393 is folded if and only if the label\nof any reduced path in \u0393 is a reduced word.\nRecall the definition of the classical folding move:\nDefinition 2.4 (Fold). Let \u0393 be an F -graph. Suppose e1 6= e2 are distinct\nedges of \u0393 with common initial vertex x = o(e1 ) = o(e2 ) and with the same\nlabel a = \u03bc(e1 ) = \u03bc(e2 ) \u2208 A \u222a A\u22121 . We fold the two edges e1 , e2 into a single\nedge e labeled a. The resulting F -graph \u0393\u2032 is said to be obtained from \u0393 by\na fold.\nThe following statement immediately follows from the definitions, exactly\nas in [58]:\nProposition 2.5. Let \u0393 be a connected graph and suppose that \u0393\u2032 is obtained\nfrom \u0393 by a fold. Then the Euler characteristic of \u0393\u2032 is no less than that of\n\u0393, that is rank(\u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 )) \u2264 rank(\u03c01 (\u0393)).\nIn addition to foldings, we need the following two transformations of labeled graphs introduced by Olshanskii and Arzhantseva [6].\nRecall that we are working with a fixed presentation of a quotient G of\nF.\nDefinition 2.6 (Completing a relator cycle: move M 1). Let p be path in\nan F -graph \u0393 with initial vertex x, terminal vertex y and label \u03bc(p) = v.\nSuppose that v \u2032 is a reduced word such that v = v \u2032 in G. We modify \u0393 by\nattaching a new edge-path going from x to y labeled by the word v \u2032 .\nWe explicitly state the definition of the inverse move of M 1:\nDefinition 2.7 (Removing an arc from a relator cycle: move M 2). Let p\nbe a simple edge-path in a labeled F -graph \u0393 with an initial vertex x, a\nterminal vertex y and label \u03bc(p) = v and suppose that p is contained in\na maximal arc of \u0393 (an arc is a simple path, possibly closed, where every\nintermediate vertex of the path has degree two in \u0393). Suppose there exists\na path p\u2032 in \u0393 from x to y with label \u03bc(p\u2032 ) = v \u2032 such that p\u2032 and p\u00b11 have\nno common edges and such that v =G v \u2032 in G.\nWe modify \u0393 by removing all the edges of p from \u0393 while keeping the\nvertices x and y.\nNote that M 1 decreases the Euler characteristic by one and that M 2\nincreases the Euler characteristic by one.\nDefinition 2.8 (Removing a degree-one vertex: move R). Suppose e is an\nedge of an F -graph \u0393 such that the vertex t(e) has degree one in \u0393. We\nremove the edge e and the vertex t(e) from \u0393.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n9\n\nDefinition 2.9 (Combination Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii move: move AO).\nSuppose \u0393 is a connected F -graph. Let p1 p\u2032 p2 be a reduced path in \u0393 such\nthat p\u2032 is a path contained in a maximal arc of \u0393 and the paths p1 , p2 do\nnot overlap p\u2032 . Let u1 and u2 be respectively the labels of p1 and p2 and\nlet u be the label of p\u2032 . Suppose y is a reduced word such that u1 uu2 y = 1\nin G. Perform a combination of M 1 and M 2 by first attaching to \u0393 a new\nedge-path f labeled y from t(p2 ) to o(p1 ) and then removing the arc p\u2032 . The\nresulting graph \u0393\u2032 is said to be obtained from \u0393 by a move of type AO.\nProposition-Definition 2.10. Let \u0393 be a connected F -graph with a basevertex x0 . Then the labeling of paths gives rise to a homomorphism\n\u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 ) \u2192 G\nsuch that for every path p from x0 to x0 we have \u03c6([p]) =G \u03bc(p) in G (where\n[p] stands for the equivalence class of p in \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 )). In this case we will\nsay that H = \u03c6(\u03c01 (\u0393, x0 )) \u2264 G is the subgroup represented by (\u0393, x0 ).\nMoreover, the following holds:\n(1) If \u0393 is finite then image(\u03c6) is finitely generated. If, in addition, \u0393\nhas Euler characteristic 1 \u2212 k, then the free group \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 ) has rank\nk and hence \u03c6(\u03c01 (\u0393, x0 )) can be generated by k elements.\n(2) If x1 is another vertex of \u0393 then the pairs (\u0393, x0 ) and (\u0393, x1 ) define\nconjugate subgroups of G.\n(3) Every finitely generated subgroup of G can be represented in this\nfashion for some finite connected \u0393. Moreover, if H \u2264 G is kgenerated, then H can be represented by a connected F -graph of\nEuler characteristic \u2265 1 \u2212 k.\nThe following simple fact plays an important role in our approach.\nProposition 2.11. Let \u0393 be an F -graph with a base-vertex x0 . Suppose\n\u0393\u2032 is obtained from \u0393 by a finite sequence of folds and as well as moves\nM 1, M 2, so that x\u20320 is the image of x0 in \u0393\u2032 . Then the pairs (\u0393, x0 ) and\n(\u0393\u2032 , x\u20320 ) define the same subgroup of G.\nMoreover, if \u0393\u2032 is obtained from \u0393 by removing a degree-one vertex move\nR, then for any vertices x of \u0393 and x\u2032 of \u0393\u2032 the pairs (\u0393, x) and (\u0393\u2032 , x\u2032 )\ndefine conjugate subgroups of G.\n3. Nielsen equivalence\nWe wish to examine more closely the effects of the moves AO, M 1, M 2\non Nielsen-equivalence classes of generating tuples for the subgroups defined\nby labeled graphs.\nThe following simple but crucial lemma is due to Arzhantseva (Lemma 2\nof [5]). The proof is a straightforward corollary of the definitions and relies\non the fact that any two free bases of a free group of finite rank are Nielsenequivalent. This applies in particular to the fundamental group of a finite\ngraph.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n10\n\nLemma 3.1. [5] Let \u0393 be a connected F -graph with a base-vertex x0 . Let\n\u0393\u2032 be obtained from \u0393 by a fold preserving the Euler characteristic or by a\nmove AO or by removing a degree-one vertex different from x0 . Denote the\nimage of x0 by x\u20320 . Let \u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 ) \u2192 G and \u03c6\u2032 : \u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 , x\u20320 ) \u2192 G be the\nlabel maps for \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 respectively. Thus image(\u03c6) = image(\u03c6) = H \u2264 G.\nThen for any m-tuples \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 freely generating \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 ) and \u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 , x\u20320 )\nrespectively, the m-tuples \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ) are Nielsen-equivalent in G.\nMoreover, if x0 has degree one in \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 is obtained from \u0393 by an Rmove removing x0 then for any vertex x\u20320 of \u0393\u2032 and any m-tuples \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 as\nabove, the m-tuple \u03c6(\u03c4 ) is conjugate to an m-tuple that is Nielsen-equivalent\nto \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ) in G.\n4. The Genericity condition\nWe fix m > 1 and thus A = {a1 , . . . , am } and F = F (A). We now give\nthe definitions needed for the genericity condition.\nDefinition 4.1. [6] Let 0 < \u03bc \u2264 1 be a real number. A reduced word w in\nF (A) = F (a1 , . . . , am ) of length l > 0 is called \u03bc-readable if there exists a\nconnected F -graph \u0393 where every edge is labeled by a letter of A such that:\n(1) The number of edges in \u0393 is at most \u03bcl.\n(2) The free group \u03c01 (\u0393) has rank at most m \u2212 1.\n(3) There is a reduced path in \u0393 with label w.\nDefinition 4.2. [2] Let 0 < \u03bc \u2264 1 be a real number and let L > 1 be an\ninteger. A reduced word w in F (A) of length l > 0 is called (\u03bc, L)-readable\nif there exists a connected F -graph \u0393 such that:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe number of edges in \u0393 is at most \u03bcl.\nThe free group \u03c01 (\u0393) has rank at most L.\nThere is a path in \u0393 with label w.\nThe graph \u0393 has at least one vertex of degree < 2m.\n\nClearly, for fixed integer L and a rational \u03bc the problem of deciding if\nan arbitrary w \u2208 F (A) is \u03bc-readable or (\u03bc, L)-readable, is decidable in time\nexponential in the length of w. Although the definition may seem technical,\nhow the concept of (\u03bc, L)-readability leads to constructing exponentially\ngeneric families of presentations is actually simple. The only folded subgroup\ngraph of rank m for a set of generators of the free group F of rank m is the\nbouquet of m loops at a single vertex where the loops are labeled by the\ngenerators ai of F . All words of a given length l can be obtained as the label\nof a reduced path in this graph. Compare this case with the other graph\nof rank m = 3 which has a vertex of degree less than 2m, as illustrated\nin Figure 1 for F = F (a, b, c). It is easy to see that the number of words\nwhich are readable as labels of reduced paths of length l in the second graph\ndivided by the number of all possible reduced words of length l is going to\n0 exponentially fast.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\na\n\n1\n0\n\nb\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nc\n\n11\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0b\n1\n\nc\nFigure 1. Illustrating the \"readability\" condition\n\nWe can now define an appropriate small cancellation condition to take\nadvantage of such a situation.\nDefinition 4.3. Let 0 < \u03bc \u2264 1 be a real number, let n > 0 and L \u2265 m be\nintegers and let 0 < \u03bb be a real number such that\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u2264\n< 1/6.\n\u03bb\u2264\n15L + 3\u03bc\n15m + 3\u03bc\nWe will say that a tuple of nontrivial cyclically reduced words (r1 , . . . , rn )\nin F (A) satisfies the (\u03bb, \u03bc, L)-condition if:\n(1) The tuple (r1 , . . . , rn ) satisfies the C \u2032 (\u03bb) small cancellation condition.\n(2) The words ri are not proper powers in F (A).\n(3) If w is a subword of a cyclic permutation of some ri and |w| \u2265 |ri |/2\nthen w is not (\u03bc, L)-readable and not \u03bc-readable.\nWe refer the reader to [41] for the basic definitions and background information regarding small cancellation theory.\nAgain, it is easy to see that if we fix an integer L and rational numbers \u03bb, \u03bc\nas above then for an arbitrary n-tuple (r1 , . . . , rn ) we can decide whether\nor P\nnot the tuple satisfies the (\u03bb, \u03bc, L)-condition in time at most exponential\nin\n|ri |. The following condition is the intersection of the (\u03bb, \u03bc)-condition\nfrom [6] and what was called (\u03bb, \u03bc, L)-condition in [2].\nDefinition 4.4. Let m > 1, n > 0 and F = F (a1 , . . . , am ). Let \u03bb, \u03bc, L\nbe as in Definition 4.3. We define the class P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n) of finite group\npresentations on m generators with n defining relators as the collection of\nall presentations of the form\nha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . rn i\nwhere the n-tuple (r1 , . . . , rn ) satisfies the (\u03bb, \u03bc, L)-condition.\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n12\n\nArzhantseva and Ol'shanskii [6, 2] prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.5. The condition P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n) is exponentially (m, n)-generic.\n5. Proofs of the main results\nThe following lemma plays an important role in our argument. This\nstatement is due to Arzhantseva [2] and is contained (although not stated\nexplicitly) in section 4 of [2]. In fact, this lemma is a crucial step in the\nproof of Theorem 1 of [2].\nLemma 5.1. [2] Let G be a group given by a finite presentation\nG = ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . , rn i\nbelonging to class P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n).\nLet \u0393 be a connected folded F -graph with a base-vertex x0 and with\nrank(\u03c01 (\u0393), x0 )) \u2264 L.\nSuppose that \u0393 has at least one vertex has degree < 2m and no vertices of\ndegree one, except possibly x0 .\nThen either \u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393, x0 ) \u2192 G is injective (and hence H = image(\u03c6) is\nfree) or there exists an AO-move on \u0393 that reduces the number of edges of\n\u0393.\nProof. For completeness, we will give a sketch of the argument, which first\nappeared, in essentially the same form, in the paper of Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii [6].\nIf \u03c6 is not injective then there is a nontrivial reduced loop at x0 in \u0393 whose\nlabel is equal to 1 in G. Since \u0393 is folded, the label of this loop is a reduced\nword. The small cancellation assumption C \u2032 (\u03bb) on the presentation of G\nthen implies that the label of this loop contains a subword v which is also\na subword of a cyclic permutation r of some ri\u00b11 from the presentation of\nG and such that v is missing less than 3\u03bb|r| letters of r. After possibly\nreplacing the loop by its inverse, we may assume that v = ri . Thus v is\nthe label of a reduced path p in \u0393 and |v| > (1 \u2212 3\u03bb)|r|. The assumption\nthat rank(\u03c01 (\u0393), x0 )) \u2264 L implies that \u0393 contains at most 3L \u2212 1 maximal\narcs. These maximal arcs break up p as a concatenation p = p1 p2 . . . pk of\nk subpaths with labels v1 , . . . , vk , where p2 . . . pk\u22121 are maximal arcs. Thus\nv = v 1 . . . vk .\nSuppose first that there is some pi with |pi | \u2265 5\u03bb|r|. In this situation a\ncase-by-case analysis of possible overlaps of pi with the other paths pj will\nshow that some AO-type move reduces the number of edges.\nWe claim that there is a subpath of pi of length at least 3\u03bb|r| that does\nnot overlap the rest of the path p. Indeed, suppose first that 1 < i < k,\nso that pi is a maximal arc of \u0393. Since |pi | \u2265 5\u03bb|r|, the C \u2032 (\u03bb)-condition\nand the assumption that r is not a proper power imply that pi 6= p\u00b11\nfor\nj\nj 6= i, 1 < j < k and hence pi does not overlap any of such pj . Similarly,\nthe overlap of pi with each of p1 , pk has length less than \u03bb|r|. Therefore\nthere is a subpath of pi of length at least 3\u03bb|r| that does not overlap the\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n13\n\nrest of the path p, as claimed. Suppose now that i = 1 (the case i = k is\nsymmetric) and |p1 | \u2265 5\u03bb|r|. Then p1 does not overlap any of pi , 1 < i < k\nsince otherwise we are in the previous case. The overlap between p1 and pk\nhas length less than \u03bb|r| because of the C \u2032 (\u03bb)-condition and the fact that r\nis not a proper power. This yields the claim as before.\nThus indeed there is a subpath p\u2032 of pi such that |p\u2032 | \u2265 3\u03bb|r| and that p\u2032\ndoes not overlap the rest of p. Then we can perform an AO-move on \u0393 as\nfollows: first add an arc from t(pk ) = t(p) to o(p1 ) = o(p) labeled by the\nmissing in v part of the relator r (of length < 3\u03bb|r|) and then remove the\narc p\u2032 . Clearly, this reduces the number of edges in \u0393 and the conclusion of\nLemma 5.1 holds.\nSuppose now that for each i = 1, . . . , k we have |pi | < 5\u03bb|r|. Then the\nword v is readable as a label of a path in some connected subgraph \u03931 of \u0393\nand the rank of the fundamental group of \u03931 is at most L: namely, take \u03931 to\nbe the union of all edges traversed by p, that is the edges contained in \u222aki=1 pi .\nThe graph \u0393 contains at least one vertex of degree < 2n by assumption and\nhence so does \u03931 (Lemma 2 of [2]). Moreover, \u0393 has at most 3L \u2212 1 distinct\nmaximal arcs and each pi is contained in a maximal arc of \u0393. Therefore the\nnumber of edges in \u03931 is \u2264 3L * 5\u03bb|r| \u2264 \u03bc(1 \u2212 3\u03bb)|r| \u2264 \u03bc|v| by the choice of\n\u03bb and v. Since v is a subword of a defining relation r with |v| \u2265 |r|/2, we\nget a contradiction with the assumption that the presentation of G belongs\nto P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n).\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.2. Let L \u2265 m > 1, n > 0 be integers and let F = F (A) =\nF (a1 , . . . , am ). Let 0 < \u03bc \u2264 1 and \u03bb > 0 be real numbers such that\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u2264\n< 1/6.\n\u03bb\u2264\n15L + 3\u03bc\n15m + 3\u03bc\nLet G be a group defined by a presentation G = ha1 , . . . , am |r1 , . . . rn i that\nbelongs to the class P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n).\nThen G is torsion-free one-ended word-hyperbolic and every (m \u2212 1)generated subgroup of G is free. Moreover any m-tuple, generating a non-free\nsubgroup of G, is Nielsen-equivalent to the tuple (a1 , . . . , am ) in G.\nProof. The results of Arzhantseva [2] imply that G is freely indecomposable,\ntorsion-free, non-elementary, and word-hyperbolic. In particular, she proved\nthat any group in class P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n) is not a free group.\nWe now come to the only place where we use the \u03bc-readability assumption.\nNamely, G cannot be generated by fewer than m elements since ArzhantsevaOl'shanskii [6] proved that every (m \u2212 1)-generated subgroup of G is free.\nHence G must have rank exactly m.\nLet (w1 , . . . , wm ) be an m-tuple of nontrivial freely reduced words in A \u222a\nA\u22121 generating a non-free subgroup H of G. We will show that (w1 , . . . , wm )\nis Nielsen-equivalent to P\n(a1 , . . . , am ) in G.\nWe may assume that |wi | > m since otherwise (w1 , . . . , wm ) is a permu\u00b11\ntation of (a\u00b11\n1 , . . . , am ) and there is nothing to prove. We will inductively\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n14\n\ndefine a sequence of finite connected F -graphs \u0393i (for i = 0, 1, . . . ) with the\nfollowing properties:\na) For each i the graph \u0393i represents a conjugate of H, that is for the\nlabel-maps \u03c6i : \u03c01 (\u0393i ) \u2192 G we have image(\u03c6i ) = gi Hgi\u22121 for some gi \u2208 G\n(since \u0393i represents a conjugate of H and is connected, the choice of a basevertex is irrelevant here).\nb) For each i the free group \u03c01 (\u0393i ) has rank m.\nc) For each i the graph \u0393i+1 (if it is defined) has fewer edges than \u0393i .\nd) Each \u0393i+1 is obtained from \u0393i by a combination of foldings, moves of\ntype AO, and removing vertices of degree one.\nNote that H has rank m since otherwise H can be generated by fewer\nthan m elements and hence is free by the properties of G.\nLet \u03930 be a wedge of m loop-edges labeled by w1 , . . . , wm . Note that\nw1 , . . . , wm generate a free group of rank m in F (A) since otherwise the\ngroup H can be generated by fewer than m elements.\nWe will now describe the inductive step for constructing \u0393i+1 from \u0393i .\nLet \u0393\u2032 be obtained from \u0393i by performing a sequence of foldings and\nremoving degree-one vertices until no more such moves are possible. Thus\n\u0393\u2032 is folded, connected and has no degree-one vertices. The folding moves do\nnot increase the rank of the fundamental group of an F -graph. Moreover,\nrank(\u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 )) = rank(\u03c01 (\u0393i )) = m since rank(\u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 )) < m would imply that\nH could be generated by fewer than m elements.\nIf \u0393\u2032 is the wedge of m loop-edges labeled a1 , . . . , am , we put \u0393i+1 = \u0393\u2032\nand terminate the process. Suppose not. Then the map \u03c6 : \u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 ) \u2192 G\n(with image(\u03c6) being a conjugate of H) is not injective since H is not free.\nNote that there is at least one vertex of degree < 2m in \u0393\u2032 . Otherwise\n\u0393\u2032 defines a subgroup of finite index k > 1 in F (a1 , . . . , am ) and hence\nrank(\u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 )) = k(m \u2212 1) + 1 > m by the Schreier index formula, contrary\nto the fact that rank(\u03c01 (\u0393\u2032 )) = m.\nLemma 5.1 then implies that there is a move of type AO which, when\napplied to \u0393\u2032 , produces a graph \u0393\u2032\u2032 with smaller total number of edges. Note\nthat by definition an AO-move does not change the rank of the fundamental\ngroup of a graph. Put \u0393i+1 = \u0393\u2032\u2032 .\nIt is clear that conditions a)-d) above hold for \u0393i+1 . This completes the\ndescription of the inductive step.\nSince the total number of edges decreases in the above process, the sequence \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . must terminate in a finite number of steps with the graph\n\u0393q which is the wedge of m loop-edges labeled a1 , . . . , am .\nBy applying Lemma 3.1 to the above sequence of graphs and looking at\nthe free bases of \u03c01 (\u03930 ) and \u03c01 (\u0393q ) we conclude that (w1 , . . . , wm ) is conjugate to a tuple that is Nielsen-equivalent to (a1 , . . . , am ) in G. Hence\n(w1 , . . . , wm ) generates G. For m-tuples generating G conjugation implies\nNielsen-equivalence and hence (w1 , . . . , wm ) is Nielsen-equivalent to the tuple (a1 , . . . , am ) in G, as required.\n\u0003\n\n\fGENERICITY AND THE ISOMORPHISM PROBLEM\n\n15\n\nProof of Theorem B. The results of Arzhantseva-Ol'shanskii (Lemma 4 of [6])\nand Arzhantseva (Lemma 5 of [2]) imply that under the assumptions of Theorem 5.2 the class P (\u03bb, \u03bc, L, m, n) is exponentially (m, n)-generic (since it\nis the intersection of two exponentially generic classes). Hence Theorem 5.2\nabove, by choosing rational \u03bc and \u03bb, implies Theorem B from the introduction.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] J.Alonso, T.Brady, D.Cooper, V.Ferlini, M.Lustig, M.Mihalik, M.Shapiro and\nH.Short, Notes on hyperbolic groups, In: \" Group theory from a geometrical viewpoint\", Proceedings of the workshop held in Trieste, \u00c9.
