This relation is called\nthe little higgs mechanism. We discuss how accurately the relation can be tested at\nfuture e+ e\u2212 colliders, with especially focusing on the top sector of the scenario using\na method of effective lagrangian. In order to test the mechanism, it is important\nto measure the Yukawa coupling of the top partner. Higgs associated and threshold\nproductions of the top partner are found to be the best processes for this purpose.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe standard model (SM) is well known to have the little hierarchy problem [1], which is\nessentially from quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term. The little higgs\nscenario [2] has been proposed to solve the problem, where the higgs boson is regarded as a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the breaking of a global symmetry at the\nO(10) TeV scale. Explicit breaking terms of the symmetry are specially arranged to cancel\nthe corrections at one-loop level. The mechanism of this cancellation is called the little higgs\nmechanism, which is commonly equipped in all models of the scenario.\nThe little higgs mechanism predicts the existence of new particles called little higgs partners at the O(1) TeV scale. The mechanism also predicts some relations between coupling\nconstants of SM interactions and those of the new particles. Among the partners, the top\npartner is the most important one, because it is responsible for the cancelation of the largest\nquadratically divergent correction. Though the top partner has a color charge and could be\nproduced at the LHC, its discovery does not mean the confirmation of the little higgs scenario. This is because new particles which are similar to the top partner are also predicted\nin various new physics models. In order to test the little higgs scenario, we have to verify\nthe relation between interactions predicted by the little higgs mechanism.\nThis verification requires us to measure the Yukawa coupling of the top partner. Future\nlinear colliders such as the international linear collider (ILC) [3] and the compact linear\ncollider (CLIC) [4] give a good opportunity for coupling measurements. Following four\nprocesses are considered in this report; higgs associated productions, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h, tT\u0304 h +\nT t\u0304h, and threshold productions, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 , T t\u0304 + tT\u0304 , where t, T , and h are top quark,\ntop partner, and higgs boson, respectively. We found that the coupling can be measured\nprecisely using the associate production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h, when the center of mass energy is\nlarge enough. The threshold production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 , also allows us to measure it with\nthe same precision. Interestingly, with smaller center of mass energy, it is even possible to\nmeasure the coupling using the threshold production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 t\u0304T + T t\u0304.\nIn the following, after introducing the effective lagrangian to describe the top sector,\nhiggs associated and threshold productions of the top partner are discussed with focusing\non how these cross sections are sensitive to the Yukawa coupling of the top partner. Since\nthis report is based on Ref. [5], please see the reference for more details.\n1\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f1.0\n\nyt\nyL\n\n0.5\n\nyR\n0.0\nyT\n\u22120.5\nYukawa couplings\n\u22121.0\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\u03bb' (in unit of \u03bb'cr )\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Yukawa couplings, yt , yT , yL , yR , as a function of \u03bb\u2032 (in unit of \u03bb\u2032cr ).\n\n2\n\nTop sector of the little higgs scenario\n\nVector-like quark called the top partner is necessarily introduced in the little higgs scenario,\nand its interactions with higgs and top quark are described by the effective lagrangian,\nLeff\n\n= \u2212mU \u016aL UR \u2212 y3 Q\u03043L H c u3R \u2212 yU Q\u03043L H c UR\n\u2212(\u03bb/mU )\u016aL u3R |H|2 \u2212 (\u03bb\u2032 /mU )\u016aL UR |H|2 + h.c.,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Q3L = (u3L , b3L )T and u3R are third generation left- and right-handed quarks of the\nSM, while UL and UR are left- and right-handed top partners whose quantum numbers are\nthe same as u3R . Higgs boson is denoted by H c with 'c' meaning charge conjugation. Since\nquadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term should be cancelled at 1-loop\nlevel, the following relation between the coupling constants, y3 , yU , and \u03bb\u2032 , is required,\n2\n\u22122\u03bb\u2032 = y32 + yU\n, which is nothing but the little higgs mechanism at the top sector.\nOnce the electroweak symmetry is broken, third generation quarks are mixed with top\npartners. In following discussions, we use the notations; mt (mT ) is the mass of the top\nquark t (top partner T ) and sin \u03b8L (sin \u03b8R ) is the mixing angle between their left-handed\n(right-handed) components. Though the model parameters, mU , y3 , yU , \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , are originally\nused in the effective lagrangian, we use following five parameters, mt , mT , sin \u03b8L , \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , as\nfundamental ones. Other parameters, mU , y3 , yU , tan \u03b8R , are therefore given as functions\nof the fundamental parameters. Yukawa interactions of t and T are given by\nLyukawa = \u2212yt t\u0304th \u2212 yT T\u0304 T h \u2212 (T\u0304 [yL PL + yR PR ]th + h.c.),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h is the higgs field. There are also gauge interactions of t and T (see Ref. [5] for\ntheir concrete expressions). Yukawa couplings are approximately given by yt \u2243 mt /v, yT \u2243\nmT sin2 \u03b8L /v + \u03bb\u2032 v cos \u03b8L /mT , yL \u2243 mT sin \u03b8L /v, and yR \u2243 mt sin \u03b8L /v + \u03bbv/mT .\nThe little higgs mechanism is described by the relation between y3 , yU , and \u03bb\u2032 . First two\nparameters y3 and yU are almost determined by mt , mT , and sin \u03b8L , which can be measured\nprecisely when T is discovered. On the other hand, we have to measure yT to determine the\nlast parameter \u03bb\u2032 . We therefore fix these parameters using the representative point,\nmT = 400GeV,\n\nsin \u03b8L = 0.2,\n\nBr(T \u2192 th)/Br(T \u2192 bW ) = 0.98,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the ratio of branching fractions corresponds to the one obtained by assuming \u03bb = 0\nwith keeping the relation of the little higgs mechanism.

The point satisfies all phenomenological constraints and is also attractive from the\nviewpoint of naturalness on the little hierarchy problem. Since mt has already been measured\nprecisely, there are four free parameters in the effective lagrangian. It is therefore possible to\ntest the little higgs mechanism by measuring one more observable, which should be sensitive\nto \u03bb\u2032 . As can be seen in Fig. 1, in which Yukawa couplings are shown as functions of \u03bb\u2032 in\n2\nunit of \u03bb\u2032cr \u2261 \u2212(y32 + yU\n)/2 with other model parameters being fixed to be those satisfying\nthe conditions of the representative point, yT is the most sensitive against the change of \u03bb\u2032\nas expected. We thus focus on physical quantities involving this Yukawa coupling.\n\n3\n\nAssociate Productions\n\nTop partner productions associated with a higgs boson enable us to determine yT by measuring their cross sections with an appropriate center of mass energy. Two higgs associated\nprocesses exist. One is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 h + T t\u0304h, and another is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h. The sum of the\ncross sections, \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 h) + \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T t\u0304h), are shown in Fig.2 (upper part of the\nleft panel) as a function of center of mass energy with several choices of \u03bb\u2032 . Other model\nparameters are fixed according to the conditions in eq.(3). In order to see the sensitivity of\nthe cross section against the change of \u03bb\u2032 , we also plot the deviation of the cross section from\nthe one predicted by the little higgs mechanism, \u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3 \u2261 [\u03c3(\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03bb\u2032cr )]/\u03c3(\u03bb\u2032cr ) (lower part\nof the left panel). The deviation becomes almost zero when the center of mass energy exceeds 800 GeV, because the production of two on-shell top partners dominates the associate\nproduction, whose production cross section and branching ratio of T \u2192 th are independent\nof \u03bb\u2032 . When the center of mass energy is below 800 GeV, the cross section is as small as 0.1\nfb and the determination of \u03bb\u2032 seems to be difficult in this associate production.\nOn the other hand, another associate production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h, is interesting, whose\ncross section and its deviation from the little higgs prediction are shown in Fig.2 (right\npanel). The cross section depends strongly on the value of \u03bb\u2032 , which enable us to explore\nthe little higgs mechanism accurately using this association process, though the production\ncross section itself is not so large and the center of mass energy must be large enough.\n3\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f12\n\n\u2212\nT T production\nCross section \u03c3 (fb)\n\nCross section \u03c3 (fb)\n\n350\n300\n250\n200\n\u03bb' = 3\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = 2\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = \u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = 0\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = \u2212\u03bb'cr\n\n150\n100\n50\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nt T + T t production\n\n10\n8\n6\n\u03bb' = 3\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = 2\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = \u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = 0\u03bb'cr\n\u03bb' = \u2212\u03bb'cr\n\n4\n2\n\n0.4\n\u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3\n\n\u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n760\n\n780\n\n800\n\n820\n\n840\n\nCenter of mass energy (GeV)\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n550\n\n560\n\n570\n\n580\n\n590\n\nCenter of mass energy (GeV)\n\nFigure 3: Cross sections for threshold productions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 + T t\u0304.\n\n4\n\nThreshold productions\n\nWe next consider top partner productions, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 + T t\u0304, at their\nthreshold energies. Since the cross sections of these processes are significantly affected by\nthe exchange of virtual higgs bosons due to the threshold singularity [6], the Yukawa coupling\nyT is expected to be determined precisely. The production cross section of the top partner\npair at threshold energy is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3 with several choices of \u03bb\u2032 . The\ndeviation of the cross section from the prediction of the little higgs mechanism is also shown\nin this figure as in the case of higgs associated productions. It can be seen that the deviation\nbecomes maximum at the peak of the cross section, which corresponds to the first bound\nstate composed of top partners. Since the cross section is huge at the peak, which is about\n250 fb\u22121 , the Yukawa coupling yT is expected to be determined precisely. It should be\nnoticed that the cross section does not depend on the sign of yT , so that there is two-fold\nambiguity in the determination of yT , as can be seen in the figure. This ambiguity is resolved\nby investigating other production channels such as higgs associated productions.\nProduction cross section of a top quark and a top partner at threshold energy as well\nas its deviation from the little higgs prediction are plotted in the right panel of Fig. 3. The\ndeviation is again maximized at the peak corresponding to the first bound state. Though\nthe cross section is lower than that of the top partner pair production, it is still possible to\ndetermine \u03bb\u2032 precisely if the integrated luminosity is large enough. One advantage is that\nthe determination of \u03bb\u2032 is possible even if the center of mass energy is not so large.\n\n5\n\nTesting the little higgs mechanism\n\nWe now consider the capability of future linear colliders to test the little higgs mechanism.\nTesting the mechanism is equivalent to the determination of \u03bb\u2032 , so that we discuss how accurately \u03bb\u2032 can be determined at collider experiments using the processes discussed in previous\nsections. We focus on the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 , and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 + T t\u0304, because these processes are very sensitive to \u03bb\u2032 .

On the other hand, the integrated luminosity is fixed\nto be Leff = 500 fb\u22121 in each process, where Leff is the effective luminosity defined by\nLeff = E \u00d7 L with E and L being the efficiency factor and the original integrated luminosity.\nThe factor depends on the acceptance of collider detectors and kinematical cuts used to reduce backgrounds from SM processes, which is determined precisely when experiments start.\nMain background against the signal is from the SM process of top quark production. Since\nthe cross section of the SM process is not too large compared to those of signal processes,\nbackground reductions are expected to be performed efficiently by imposing appropriate\nkinematical cuts. The efficiency factor from background reductions can be estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations. In our calculation, however, we take the efficiency factor so\nthat the effective luminosity becomes 500 fb\u22121 with simply assuming efficient background\nreductions. We remain the detailed calculation of the factor as a future problem.\nWith the use of the effective luminosity Leff , the \u03c72 function, which quantifies how\naccurately the determination of \u03bb\u2032 can be performed at collider experiments, is defined by\n2\n\n\u03c72 (\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2261\n\n2\n\n[\u03c3(\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03bb\u2032cr )]\n[N (\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 N (\u03bb\u2032cr )]\n=\nL\n\u00d7\n,\neff\nN (\u03bb\u2032cr )\n\u03c3(\u03bb\u2032cr )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N (\u03bb\u2032 ) = Leff \u03c3(\u03bb\u2032 ) is the number of the signal event with fixed \u03bb\u2032 , which will be\nobtained at collider experiments after imposing kinematical cuts and considering detector\nacceptances. The resultant \u03c72 distributions for the higgs associated production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nT T\u0304 h, and threshold productions, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 and e\u2217 e\u2212 \u2192 tT\u0304 +T t\u0304, are shown in Fig. 4, where\nthe center of mass energy is fixed to be 1000 GeV, 794 GeV and 568.4 GeV, respectively.\nIt can be seen that the coupling constant \u03bb\u2032 can be measured with 8% accuracy using the\nhiggs associated production. If the center of mass energy is possible to be increased to 1350\nGeV, the coupling \u03bb\u2032 can be measured with 4% accuracy using the same process.\nOn the other hand, it can be seen that the coupling constant \u03bb\u2032 can be determined with\n4% accuracy using the threshold production of top partner pair production. In this case,\nthe center of mass energy required for the determination is smaller than that of the higgs\nassociated production. Furthermore, using the threshold production of a top quark and a\ntop partner, the coupling constant \u03bb\u2032 can be measured with 20% accuracy even if the center\nof mass energy is smaller than other processes , which is around 500 GeV.\n5\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f6\n\nSummary\n\nWe have studied the capability of future collider experiments to test the little higgs mechanism. The mechanism predicts a certain relation between coupling constants in the top\nsector of the little higgs scenario. The test of the mechanism is essentially equivalent to\nthe measurement of the Yukawa coupling of the top partner, namely the coupling constant\n\u03bb\u2032 . It is therefore very important to investigate how accurately \u03bb\u2032 can be measured at\nthe experiments. With the use of an appropriate representative point, we found that the\ncoupling constant can be measured with a few percent accuracy using the higgs associated\nproduction, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 h, and the threshold production, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 T T\u0304 , when the center of\nmass energy is O(1) TeV. On the other hand, using the threshold production, T t\u0304 + tT\u0304 , the\nmeasurement of \u03bb\u2032 is still possible with a few ten percent accuracy even if the center of mass\nenergy is around 500 GeV. When the top partner is discovered at the LHC experiment, the\nprocesses emphasized in this report will be important to confirm whether the top partner is\nreally the one predicted by the little higgs scenario or not.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture (MEXT), Japan, (Nos. 22244021 & 23740169) and World\nPremier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative), MEXT, Japan.\n\nReferences\n[1] For recent analysis, see R.
