This mechanism allows fermions and the W and Z bosons\nto acquire their masses by interaction with the Higgs field. To discover the Higgs boson,\ntherefore, is of crucial interest to complete the SM. Electroweak precision measurements\nsuggest the mass of the Higgs boson to be of the order O(100 GeV). Direct searches at\nLEP have set a lower mass limit of 114 GeV. A Higgs boson with a mass above 114 GeV\nwill be accessible in the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, to be\nsure about the nature of the particle found, it is necessary to measure its properties such as\nmass, width, charge, spin, parity, couplings to other particles, and self-couplings to test the\ninternal consistency of the SM, or to find hints for new physics.\nFor the determination of at least some of these quantities, LHC will not be sufficient.\nAt the future International Linear Collider (ILC), we will have the chance to investigate\nthe properties of new particles with high precision in all details. This e+ e\u2212 collider with a\ncenter-of-mass energy up to 1 TeV provides a well known initial state, a very clear signature\nfor events of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH, and due to its high luminosity sufficient statistics for precision\nmeasurements.\nIn the Higgs-strahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH, we can investigate the coupling of the Higgs\nboson to the Z boson and determine the Higgs boson mass with high precision in a relatively\nmodel-independent way using the recoil mass spectrum against the Z,\nm2recoil = s + m2di\u2212lepton \u2212 2 * Edi\u2212lepton *\n\n\u221a\n\ns,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the square of the centre-of-mass energy, and mdi\u2212lepton and Edi\u2212lepton are the\nmass and the energy of the leptons originating from the Z decay.\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fPrevious studies using simplified parametric detector simulations have shown the potential of this technique [3].\nHere, we study the prospects to measure the Higgs boson mass and cross section assuming\nits mass to be 120 GeV. At a centre-of-mass energy of 250 GeV, a full detector simulation of\nthe process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH is performed using the Mokka software package, which simulates\nevents in the LDC detector. The response from the sub-detectors is digitised as in a real\nexperiment and is processed using the MarlinReco [4] reconstruction software. In addition,\nSM background processes are treated in the same way.\nThe Z is reconstructed from its decays into electrons and muons. Algorithms are developed to identify electrons and muons using the tracker and calorimeter information. A\nlikelihood technique is used to separate signal events from the SM background processes\nwith high efficiency.\n\n2\n\nExperimental Conditions\n\nThe study assumes a linear e+ e\u2212 collider operating at a centre-of-mass energy of 250 GeV.\nThis energy is chosen because the Higgs-strahlung cross section for the SM Higgs boson with\na mass of 120 GeV reaches its maximal value.\nThe statistics for signal and background events corresponds to a luminosity of 50 fb\u22121 .\nSignal events were generated using Pyhtia 6.4.11 [5]. Initial and final state bremsstrahlung\nand beamstrahlung are taken into account. To simulate beamstrahlung the GuineaPig 1.4.1\n[6] program is used assuming ILC nominal beam parameters. Background events are produced using in addition the event generators BHwide 1.04 [7] and Sherpa 1.0.10 [8] as\nlisted in Table 1.\nSignal and background events are passed through a full detector simulation (Mokka)\nand are processed in the full reconstruction scheme of Marlin. A sketch of the simulation\nstages is shown in Figure 1.

Beamstrahlung is treated by GuineaPig.\nMokka and Marlin simulate and reconstruct events in the LDC detector. The analysis software\nis based on ROOT.\ntion. The vertex detector (VTX) consists of five layers of silicon pixel detectors. The main\ntracker is a TPC of about 3 m diameter and 4 m length supplemented by cylindrical silicon\nstrip detectors (SIT) and forward strip and pixel detectors (FTD). The TPC is surrounded\nby the electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimeter, which in turn are enclosed by the 4 T magnet and the iron yoke. ECAL is a finely segmented silicon-tungsten\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fsandwich calorimeter. HCAL consists of a steel absorber structure with small scintillator\ntiles read out with silicon photomultipliers. When this analysis was performed no muon\nchamber was implemented in Mokka. Thus the separation of muons and pions in the particle identification is done using the trackers and calorimeters only. The precision of the\nmomentum measurement of the tracker system (TPC+VTX+SIT+FTD) is obtained to be\n\u03c3pt /pt = 7 * 10\u22125 * pt [GeV] using the FullLDCTracking processor in MarlinReco.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n\nProcess\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ \u2192 Xl+ l\u2212\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\ne + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 Xe, X\u03bc, Xe\u03bc\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 f f \u0304\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 f f \u0304\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 e+ e\u2212\ne + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\ne + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\n\u03c3 [fb]\n15.0\n4144.5\n4281.0\n4182.0\n5650.0\n475.7\n359.4\n24.6\n7.2\n177.0\n\nN (50 fb\u22121 )\n751\n207223\n214050\n209100\n282277\n23784\n17970\n1231\n360\n8850\n\nGenerator\nPythia\nBHwide\nPythia\nPythia\nPythia\nSherpa\nSherpa\nSherpa\nSherpa\nSherpa\n\nTable 1: The processes simulated for this study, their cross sections, the expected statistics for an\nintegrated luminosity of 50 fb\u22121 , and the generators used. l represents e, \u03bc and f stands for \u03c4, \u03bd, q.\n\n3\n\nSimulation Details and Analysis\n\nSignal and Background Processes\nThe signal and background processes considered in the analysis, their cross sections and\nexpected statistics at 50 fb\u22121 , and the programs used to generate events are listed in Table 1.\nFor the generation of e+ e\u2212 events using BHwide, the following cuts are applied: the polar\nangle range is restricted to | cos \u03b8lep | < 0.985, the electron energy is required to be Ee >\n10 GeV, the difference of the di-lepton mass and the Z mass is |mee \u2212 mZ | < 40 GeV, and\nthe recoil mass against the Z is in the range 90 GeV \u2264 mrecoil \u2264 190 GeV. For event samples\ngenerated with Sherpa, cuts on the lepton polar angle, | cos \u03b8lep | < 0.985, the di-lepton and\ndi-parton mass, mee,qq > 10 GeV, and the energy of the final state fermions, Efermion > 5 GeV,\nare applied. These cuts avoid divergences in the cross sections, reduce computing time, and\nwould have no influence on the results.\nAnalysis Strategy\nThe signature of events from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH are two leptons of the same kind and opposite\ncharge. The invariant mass of the two leptons must be in the vicinity of the Z mass. The\ndominant background is expected from the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 l+ l\u2212 X, which is simulated\nwithin the four-fermion processes 6 - 10 in Table 1. Discriminating power is expected from\nthe polar angle distribution of the Z. Processes 2 and 3 with two electrons or muons in the\nfinal state may be selected since initial state radiation leads to a radiative return and thus\nto an invariant mass near the Z. To distinguish them from the signal, the acoplanarity angle\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fcan be used. The process 5 is a possible background due to its high cross section. The polar\nangle of the leptons can be used to distinguish the signal from this background.\nIn the fist step of the analysis, we look for isolated electrons and muons in each event\nusing a likelihood method. An electron is identified as an electromagnetic shower in the\nECAL that matches the position predicted from a track as impact point into the ECAL. A\nmuon is identified as a track matching to deposits in the ECAL and HCAL compatible with\nthe expectations from a minimum ionising particle.\nFor the second step, only events with a lepton pair of the same kind and with opposite\ncharge are accepted. If there are several pairings possible, the one with an invariant mass\nclosest to mZ is chosen.\nFor further reduction of the background the following cuts are applied to:\n- the polar angles of the leptons: | cos \u03b8lep | < 0.95,\n\n- the difference between the invariant di-lepton mass and mZ : |mdi\u2212lepton \u2212 mZ | <\n30 GeV,\n\n- the lepton energy: Elep > 15 GeV,\n- the recoil mass: 90 GeV \u2264 mrecoil \u2264 190 GeV,\n\n- the polar angle of the di-electron system: | cos \u03b8di\u2212electron| < 0.90.\nThe remaining events are analysed using likelihood density functions for the signal, the\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f, and the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2f background channels in the variables: acoplanarity angle of\nthe two leptons, acolinearity angle of the two leptons, the di-lepton mass, the polar angle of\nthe di-lepton system, the polar angles of the two leptons and the transverse momentum of\nthe Z.\nFor each event a likelihood is calculated characterising \u221a\nits compatibility with a signal\nevent. A cut on this likelihood is set such that the quantity S+B\nis minimised in the mass\nS\nrange from 119 GeV to 125 GeV. Here, S and B are the numbers of signal and background\nevents, respectively, in the final sample.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\nIn the final sample, the signal selection efficiency is obtained to be 43.1% for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nZh \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X and 57.2% for the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X channel, respectively. The recoil\nmass spectra are shown in Figure 2 for these processes. In both spectra a signal peak is seen\non top of a moderate background. The signal has a smaller width in the di-muon channel,\npresumably because the muon track measurement is more precise due to less bremsstrahlung\nin the material of the detectors. This is confirmed by the resolution function for the transverse momentum, which has a pronounced tail to lower reconstructed momenta for electrons.\n\nCross Section Measurement\nThe recoil mass spectra in Figure 2 are used to determine the cross sections for the processes\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X.

The dark red distribution originates from the signal\nprocess and the light red distribution from the remaining background.\namount of the signal. The signal is described using the following parametrisation,\n(\n2\n2\ne\u2212(x\u2212m0 ) /(2\u03c3gaus )\n: x < m0 ,\ns(x) = NormGausExp\n2\n\u2212(x\u2212m0 )2 /(2\u03c3gaus\n)\n\u2212(x\u2212m0 )/\u03bb\n\u03b2e\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b2)e\n: x > m0 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m0 is the central value of the peak, \u03bb a constant to describe the tail to larger values\nin the signal mass distribution and 1 \u2212 \u03b2 is the fraction of the tail. The tail to larger mass\nvalues in the signal is caused by bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung. The former is well\npredicted from QED and the latter depends on the machine parameters. For known and\nreasonable stable machine parameters the shape and fraction of the tail can be determined,\nand we keep it constant in the fit, varying only m0 and the number of events in the signal,\nNsignal . The cross section of the signal process is obtained from\n\u03c3(process) = Nsignal /(L\u03b5),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L is the integrated luminosity, and \u03b5 is the signal selection efficiency. The results\nobtained are \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH) = 216.0 fb with an uncertainty of 20% using the di-electron\nfinal state and \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH) = 219.7 fb with an uncertainty of 10% using the di-muon final\nstate. Both results agree with the value of the cross section of 226.8 fb obtained from Pythia.\nAn alternative method is to count all events, N , in the signal mass range from 119 GeV\nto 125 GeV and to subtract the background. The latter is obtained from a high statistics\nMonte Carlo simulation or from the integral over a parametrised background distribution in\nthe same mass range, hBi. The cross section is then given by\n\u03c3(process) = (N \u2212 hBi)/(L\u03b5),\n\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nwith an uncertainty of (\u00b1 N /(N \u2212 hBi) [%] . Using this method no assumption on the\nsignal peak parametrisation is needed. The results obtained are compatible with the fit\nresults given above.\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fHiggs boson mass\nTo determine the Higgs boson mass from the spectra shown in Figure 2 a likelihood method\nis used. Several signal samples of high statistics with Higgs boson masses between 119 and\n121 GeV are generated and processed through the full simulation, reconstruction and analysis\nchain. The obtained spectra are parametrised using Formula (2). These parametrisations\nare then used in an unbinned likelihood fit to the simulated event samples shown in Figure\n2 to determine the Higgs boson mass mh . The results are mh = 119.78 \u00b1 0.42 GeV and\nmh = 120.09 \u00b1 0.12 GeV for the Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and Z \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays, respectively.\n\n4\n0.008\n3.5\n\u2206\u03c3/ \u03c3 [%]\n\n\u2206 Mh [GeV]\n\n0.007\n\n0.006\n\n3\n2.5\n2\n\n0.005\n\n1.5\n0.004\n1\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n240\nECMS [GeV]\n\n250\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n240\nECMS [GeV]\n\n250\n\nFigure 3: Uncertainties on the Higgs boson recoil mass measurement (left) and on the Higgs boson\nproduction cross section (right) as a function of the centre-of-mass energy. A Monte Carlo toy\nmodel with parametrised momentum resolution is used.\n\nEstimate of the Optimal Centre-of-Mass Energy for the Measurements\nA Monte Carlo toy model is used to estimate the optimal centre-of-mass energy for the measurement of the Higgs boson mass and cross section. The resolution of the track momentum\nmeasurement is parametrised as \u03c3pt /pt = 10\u22124 * pt [GeV]. A lepton identification and pair\nmatching is performed as described above. For a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV the recoil\nmass spectra are used to determine the Higgs boson mass and cross section for centre-ofmass energies between 210 GeV and 250 GeV. The estimated accuracies for the mass and\ncross section measurements are shown in Figure 3 as a function of the centre-of-mass energy assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 fb\u22121 . The minimal uncertainty on the recoil\nmass occurs for Ecms = 220 GeV, in agreement with the results obtained in Ref.[10]. The\ncross section uncertainty is minimal for Ecms = 240 GeV, becoming worse by about 20% at\nEcms = 220 GeV.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe recoil mass technique is a unique tool to determine the mass and cross section of the\nHiggs boson at the ILC. For the first time the prospects obtained from a full detector\nsimulation and reconstruction are presented. Choosing the center-of-mass energy a few ten\nGeV above the kinematic threshold, here 250 GeV for mh = 120 GeV, the Higgs boson mass\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fand cross section can be determined with an accuracy of 120 MeV and 9%, respectively,\nusing only 50 fb\u22121 . To reach a similar accuracy at a center-of-mass energy of 350 GeV, an\nintegrated luminosity 500 fb\u22121 is needed.\nThe talk held at the LCWS is available under Ref. [11].\n\nReferences\n[1] S.L.
