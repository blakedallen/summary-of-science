Introduction\nManganites like La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (LCMO) exhibit a Jan-Teller effect with a strong electron\nphonon interaction [1] and a metal insulator transition (MIT) at high temperatures (above\n200K). To experimentally investigate the MIT, or more general the dynamic conductivity of\nthin films, surface acoustic waves (SAW) turned out to be an ideal tool [2]. This is because a\nSAW on a piezoelectric substrate is accompanied by piezoelectric fields propagating at the\nspeed of sound, which strongly interact with mobile carriers in the thin film. On piezoelectric\nsubstrates, like LiNbO3 (LNB), SAW are readily excited by means of so-called interdigital\ntransducers (IDT) by injection of a HF signal into\n\nsuch comblike interdigitated metal\n\nelectrodes on top of the surface.\nWithin this work we deposited LCMO thin films with our pulsed laser deposition (PLD)\nsystem on (100) SrTiO3, (100) MgO YZ-cut and 128\u00b0cut LiNbO3 substrates. In the following\nwe will very briefly describe our Laser Ablation System and give details on the film\ndeposition. X-ray diffraction data and SEM images will be discussed as well as the resulting\nDC resistance curves. For comparison, contact less SAW transmission data will be presented\nand discussed, accordingly.\n\n2. Experimental details\nLaser Ablation System\nA typical laser ablation system consists of a vacuum recipient with a heated sample holder,\nand a target of the material to be deposited onto the substrate. This target is irradiated through\na window by an intense laser beam, generating a flash of the target material towards the\nsubstrate. Details of the laser ablation system in general are described elsewhere [2].\nIn our setup, we used 30 ns UV-pulses (\u03bb=248 nm), generated by an excimer laser (KrF /\nLPX 300 / Lambda Physics). A lens in front of the recipient chamber projects an aperture onto\nthe rotating target. The cross section of the beam is thereby reduced about 10 times and\n\n\f3\nhence the energy density on the target is concentrated to 3.5-10 J/cm2. This results in an\nevaporation of the target material and a plasma plume perpendicular to the target surface.\nDuring the ablation process oxygen pressure and laser energy are adjusted to let the plasma\nplume just reach the sample.\n\nFilm deposition\nTable I gives an overview of the structural parameter of the used substrates (SrTiO3, MgO,\nLiNbO3) and of LCMO. As one can see, there is always a strong lattice mismatch between\nthe substrate and the LCMO. In the case of YZ-cut LiNbO3 and 128\u00b0-cut LiNbO3 , the (300)\nor the (104) plane is parallel to the surface, respectively.\nMaterial\n\na [nm]\n\nb [nm]\n\nc [nm]\n\nax\n\n\u03b5=\n\nbx\n\n\u03b5=\n\nbLCMO\n0.51\n\nbx\n\n\u03b5=\n\n(100) SrTiO3\n\n3.91\n\n3.91\n\n3.91\n\na LCMO\n0.72\n\nc LCMO\n0.71\n\nLiNbO3\n\n5.15\n\n5.15\n\n13.86\n\n0.94\n\n0.67\n\n0.94\n\nYZ-LiNbO3\n\n5.15\n\n13.86\n\n-\n\n0.94\n\n1.8\n\n2.53\n\n128\u00b0-LiNbO3\n\n5.15\n\n6.21\n\n-\n\n0.94\n\n0.81\n\n1.14\n\nLa0.67Ca0.33MnO3\n\n5.45\n\n7.70\n\n5.47\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTable I: overview of the structural parameter of the used substrates (SrTiO3, MgO, LiNbO3) and of LCMO.\n\nFor the actual LCMO deposition, an oxygen background pressure of pO=1 mbar, a heater\ntemperature of TH=800\u00b0C and a laser repetition rate of frep=10Hz was used (in general 10.000\nPulses, resulting in a film thickness of about d=400nm). The energy density in this case can\nbe estimated to be about DE=4J/cm2.\nThe film morphology was then determined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM at 15\nkV). The crystallographic structure was determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) (CuK\u03b1) and\nthe film composition by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).\n\n\f4\nAfter structural characterisation, the LCMO films are laterally patterned into a Hall-bar\ngeometry employing a lithographical structured photo resist etch-mask, followed by a wet\netching step in HCl. In a second lithographical step, contact pads for the Hall-bar and the\ninterdigital-transducers (IDT) are defined by optical lithography, metal-deposition and a\nfollowing lift-off step. We used IDTs with a wave length of \u03bbSAW=26.5 \u03bcm and N=42 pairs of\nfingers. The aperture of the IDT and hence the width of the acoustic path was chosen to be\nWSAW= 604 \u03bcm = 23 \u03bbSAW. Perpendicular to the SAW beam of the acoustic delay line, a thin\nLCMO Hall bar (2mm x 15\u03bcm) with additional Ohmic contacts for DC 4-probemeasurements is defined (Fig. 1).\nThe DC Hall bar measurements where performed with a constant current source and a\nvoltmeter. For the SAW- transmission measurements an standard SAW setup consisting of a\nRF-generator and a Spectrum Analyzer was used. All low temperature measurements were\ndone in a time resolved zero span mode, and in Helium atmosphere. For this purpose, the\nsample was placed in a magnet cryostat containing a variable temperature insert (VTI) with a\ntemperature range between T= 4.2 and T= 300 K. The cryostat can provide magnetic fields\nnormal to the sample surface with a maximum magnetic field of Bmax= 9 T.\n\nFig. 1: Chip-design with two IDTs and LCMO hall-bar used for DC and SAW measurements. The thin Hall bar\nlike LCMO stripe in the center of the SAW delay line is the sample under investigation.\n\n\f5\n3. Results and discussion\nStructural and crystallographic characterization\nAfter successful deposition, the topography and structural morphology of the films was\ninvestigated. In Fig. 2, we show typical SEM images of a LCMO film grown on SrTiO3 (a),\n128\u00b0-LiNbO3 (b), YZ-LiNbO3 (c). In the case of SrTiO3 a smoother grain structure, apart\nfrom droplets from the target, can be recognized. In comparison to that LCMO on LiNbO3\nexhibits a very rough surface.\n\nFig. 2: SEM images of a LCMO film deposited on SrTiO3 (a), 128\u00b0cut LiNbO3 (b) and YZ-cut LiNbO3. The\ninfluence of the substrate on the film quality is clearly seen.\n\nIn Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we depict the results of our X-ray investigations for the films of Fig. 2. A\nTheta/2Theta scan of LCMO deposited on SrTiO3 (Fig. 3) indicated the expected epitaxial\ngrowth of LCMO. Besides the substrate peaks, only the (020) and (040) reflection of the\nLCMO was found.\n\n\f6\n\nFig.3: Theta/2Theta scan of LCMO deposited on SrTiO3 indicating the epitaxial growth of LCMO on SrTiO3\n\nIn Fig. 4, the corresponding pole figure for the two films of Fig. 2 (b) and 2(c) are shown.\nWhereas the pole figure of the LCMO film on YZ-cut LiNbO3 (4b) exhibits no pregnant\ntexture, the corresponding pole figure of the film deposited on 128\u00b0rot LiNbO3 clearly shows\nreflections of different LCMO orientations. Thereby the pole figure was taken at a 2Theta\nvalue of 58.6\u00b0 ((042) LCMO), in order to ensure that there is no recording of a substrate peak.\n\nFig. 4: Pole figure of LCMO deposited on 128\u00b0-rot LiNbO3 (a) and YZ-cut LiNbO3 (b). One clearly sees a higher\ndegree of orientation in the case of 128\u00b0-rot LiNbO3\n\nElectrical characterization\nFor the first electrical characterization of the samples fabricated, we measured the four probe\nDC resistivity of the samples, using the Hall bar geometry as described above. The most\nstriking feature in the transport behaviour of our Manganite thin films is the observation of a\n\n\f7\nprominent temperature dependence of the resistivity as a function of temperature. This\nbehaviour is generally interpreted in terms of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) [4]. On the\nSrTiO3 substrate, this metal insulator transition typically took place at around TMIT=230K\n(FWHM 50K). On both types of the piezoelectric LiNbO3 (128\u00b0-rot and YZ-cut) samples, we\nadditionally measured the film resistance versus temperature curves at two different magneticfields (B=0 and B=9 T). As expected we found a strong, magnetic field induced decrease of\nthe resistance and a pronounced shift to higher MIT-temperatures (as a measure of which we\ntook the maximum in the \u03c1(T) data) with increasing magnetic field. The resistance on YZ-cut\nLNB at the MIT is about a factor of 20 higher than on 128\u00b0-rot LNB, the MIT \u2013 temperature\nitself is shifted from about TMIT=150 K on YZ-cut LNB to more then TMIT=200 K on 128\u00b0-rot\nLNB. This shift has to be assigned to the influence of the different substrates. In both cases,\nthe LNB substrates result in a MIT temperature being lower than on the SrTiO3 substrate.\n\nFig. 5: Resistivity v. temperature at B=0 T (squares) and B=9 T (circles). In the inset the magneto resistance MR\n= (\u03c1[0T] \u2013 \u03c1[9T])/\u03c1[0T] vs. temperature is shown. a) on 128\u00b0-rot LNB; b) on YZ-cut LNB.\n\n\f8\nFor comparison, and to gain insight into the integral resistivity distribution of the thin film,\nwe simultaneously measured the temperature and magnetic field dependent SAW attenuation\nacross the LCMO thin film.\n\nFig. 6: Conductivity \u03c3 (0 T (closed circles) and 9 T(closed squares)) and SAW-attenuation \u0393 (0 T (open circles)\nand 9 T (open squares)) vs. temperature a) on 128\u00b0-rot LNB; b) on YZ-cut LNB.\n\nWhereas the DC measurements provide resistivity data which might be influenced by micro\ncracks, film inhomogeneities, or alike, a SAW transmission measurement yields a contactless\nand more integral measurement of the sheet conductivity of the film. A SAW on a\npiezoelectric substrate acts on the film like a constant voltage source of short length (\u03bbSAW)\nand correspondingly large width (WSAW). The piezoelectric interaction between the SAW and\nthe sheet conductivity of a thin film is of relaxation type and turned out to be given by [2]:\n\n\u0393=\n\n\u03c3 \u03c3m\nK2\nk\n2 1 + (\u03c3 \u03c3 m )2\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03c3 is the sheet conductivity of the thin film, K2 represents the electro mechanical\ncoupling coefficient of the piezoelectric substrate, describing the coupling between\nmechanical and electrical part of the SAW. The wave vector k=2\u03c0/\u03bbSAW accounts for the\nfrequency dependent attenuation of the chip and \u03c3m = 3e-7 \u03a9 -1sq denotes the maximum of the\nconductivity dependent attenuation curve, according to eq. 1. If we plot the \u0393(\u03c3) curve as\ndescribed by eq. 1, we end up with Fig. 7, where we show the dependence of the SAW\n\n\f9\nattenuation as a function of the sheet conductivity of a thin conducting film on top of the\nsubstrate.\n\nFig. 7: Attenuation \u0393/k in units of Keff2 versus conductivity \u03c3 in units of the characteristic conductivity \u03c3m.\n\nEmploying this well established relation between conductivity and SAW attenuation (eq. 1),\nwe are able to calculate the expected SAW attenuation from the measured DC resitivity data.\nThe result is shown by the solid lines in Fig. 8. Here, we plot the measured SAW attenuation\n\u0393(T, B) together with the calculated \u0393(T, B) curves as extracted from the DC measurements\nfor both LNB samples. Clearly, an overall correspondence between the experiment and the\ncalculated lines is observable, especially for the sample on 128\u00b0rot LNB (Fig. 8a). Here, the\noccurrence of the typical double peak structure in the zero field traces around T=200K proves\nthe validity and applicability of our model. Such a double peak structure in the \u0393(\u03c3) curve\neach time occurs, if, by undergoing a deep minimum, \u03c3(T, B) crosses \u03c3m twice, once by\nfalling below \u03c3m, and once by increasing again to \u03c3 > \u03c3m.\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 8: Measured (closed symbols) and calculated (solid lines) attenuation \u0393(T,B) for LCMO on LNB at two\ndifferent magnetic fields. In (a), we show the results for 128\u00b0rot LNB substrate, in (b), the results for YZ cut\nLNB are shown. The overall agreement between measurement and calculation is clearly satisfactory.\n\nUsing eq. 1 we calculated the attenuation curves in Fig. 8 from the measured DC\nconductivity. To achieve best agreement, we fitted the traces by adjusting the free parameters\nKeff2 and \u03c3m, respectively. Here, the depth of the attenuation minimum is mainly determined\nby Keff2, whereas the spacing of the double peak minima (see Fig. 8a) is given by the critical\nconductivity \u03c3m For the LCMO-film on 128\u00b0-rot LNB we obtain the fitting parameters K2 =\n3.8 and \u03c3m = 0.00025 1/\u03a9. As an additional correction term we had to introduce a small\nparasitic parallel conductivity \u03c3par= 0.0006 1/\u03a9. For the LCMO-film on YZ-cut LNB the\nfitting parameters resulted in K2 = 0.4 and \u03c3m = 0.0009 1/\u03a9. Both values for K2 are much\nhigher as expected, the obtained values for \u03c3m are in reasonable agreement with the expected\nvalues. The apparently very large Keff2 values are consistent with the measured extremely\nlarge absolute over all attenuation of the LCMO film on our samples. The shortness of the\nLCMO bridge in the direction of the SAW propagation would only result in a maximum\nattenuation of about \u0393max= 0,2 dB. However, we observe a total attenuation of up to 40 dB (cf.\nFig. 8a).\nSuch a large overall attenuation can only be accounted for, if, for instance, an otherwise\nundetectable series conductivity is present on the sample. The average sheet conductivity of\n\n\f11\nthis parasitic series conductivity can add significantly to the measured attenuation, as the\nSAW interaction length in this case would dramatically increase as compared to the\nintentionally processed LCMO bar. In view of the fact, that in the first place the LCMO films\nhave been deposited over the whole sample area between the IDTs, and then are removed by\nan etching process, we cannot exclude that a very thin, low conductivity film left remaining\non the SAW delay line. Further studies will certainly clarify this point.\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the successful deposition of thin Manganite films on\npiezoelectric, lattice mismatched substrates employing a pulsed laser deposition technique.\nTemperature and magnetic field dependent conductivity measurements revealed a bulk like\nmetal insulator transition of the thin film systems. The actual transition temperatures are\ndependent on the substrate chosen, being higher for substrates resulting in a better film\nmorphology. Contact less surface acoustic wave transmission measurements on these films\nare used to yield information about the areal sheet conductivity of the films, and allow for a\ndetailed investigation of the electrical properties of the films.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG under the programme\nSFB 484.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.J.
