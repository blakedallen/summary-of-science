Such responses are manifested\nultimately in the functioning of the nervous and muscular systems,\nincluding organs of crucial biological importance such as the heart\nand brain. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, key discoveries\nwere made and biophysical theories proposed concerning such ionic\n4\n\n\fcurrents, for example by Nernst (1889), Planck (1890) and Bernstein (1902). With new electrophysiological recording techniques,\nmany advances were made in the 1940's and 1950's by, amongst\nothers, in alphabetical order, Eccles, Hodgkin, Huxley and Katz see Huxley (1959) for a summary. In the 1970's and 1980's, much\nadditional insight was obtained when recordings were made of currents through single ion channels, notably by Neher and Sakmann\n(Hamill et al., 1981). In the last 20 or so years there has been an\nenormous number of discoveries concerning the factors which determine ionic current flows in neurons and muscle cells. The present\nreview concerns modeling aspects of the class of calcium currents\ncalled L-type, which, as will be seen below, have many consequences\nbeyond electrophysiology.\nFor graphic but brief historical accounts of calcium current discoveries see Tsien and Barrett (2005) and Dolphin (2006). According to the former review, \"...it is apparent that Ca2+ channels\nhave reached the forefront of the field of ion channel research...due\nto their vital role in cellular signaling, their diversity, and great\nsusceptibility to modulation...\". Records of the first single channel recording of currents identified as being L-type were given in\n(Nowycky et al., 1985). More recent single channel recordings are\nin Cens et al. (2006), where a comparison of results for Ca2+ and\nBa2+ as charge carrier is shown, and Schr\u00f6der et al. (1998), where\nthe much greater magnitude of L-type currents in failing heart are\ncompared with those in normal heart.\nThe principal motivation for the analysis and quantitative modeling of L-type calcium currents is that they occur in most nerve and\nmuscle cells. They often play basic roles in pacemaker activity (see\nSection 5.2) and more generally in regulating spike frequency by inducing afterhyperpolarization, as for example in the hippocampus\nby coupling to SK channels (Tanabe et al.,1998). Wu et al. (2008)\nshowed that L-type Ca2+ current in CA1 pyramidal cells, by coupling to delayed rectifier potassium channels (Kv 7.x), can give rise\nto long-lasting changes in adaptation.\nComprehensive models of nerve cells may include spatial variations or not, but in either case the minimum number of current\ncomponents is at least 10 and amongst these there should or will\nusually be included several Ca2+ currents. If they are included in a\n5\n\n\fmodel, L-type currents require a careful treatment and our aim here\nis to attempt to summarize several details of their basic properties\nand modeling which have been employed for many kinds of nerve\nand muscle cell.\n\n1.2\n\nIon channels and neurons\n\nMany protein molecules are embedded in the cell membranes of\nneurons. Some of these molecules are receptors for the main central\nneurotransmitters glutamate (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory),\nas well as transmitter/modulators such as noradrenaline, dopamine,\nand serotonin all of which are released from vesicles in response to\nsignals arriving at synapses where neighboring cells make close contact. (See for example Cooper et al. (2003) for an introduction to\nbasic neurochemistry and neuropharmacology.) Of particular importance in determining the way in which a neuron behaves in response to electrical and chemical stimuli are other protein molecules\nwhich serve as entrance and exit pathways for electrically charged\nions. Such molecules are called ion channels.\nIf an ion channel is relatively more selective for a certain kind\nof ion, for example, sodium, Na+ , then it is called a sodium channel. The most commonly occurring cation channels in neurons are\nsodium, potassium and calcium. Such ion channels may be open or\nclosed, which means they may or may not permit the passage of ions\nthrough them. One of the chief consequences of the ionic currents\nwhich flow through such channels when they are open is the alteration of the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane.\nIn the resting state, this potential difference is in the approximate\nrange from -80 mV to -50 mV. An inward flux of positive ions such\nas Na+ or Ca2+ leads to a diminution of the potential difference,\ncalled depolarization or excitation, which, if sufficiently strong, may\ngive rise to an action potential or spike. When the membrane is\ndepolarized, ion channels such as those of Ca2+ undergo conformational changes which lead to their opening for certain time intervals.\nHence they are called voltage-gated ion channels.\n\n6\n\n\f1.2.1\n\nActivation and inactivation\n\nThe process of opening the channel is called activation. However,\nchannels may be in several different states because often there is\nalso a process of inactivation which is not simply the cessation of\nactivation. For a channel to be conducting, the inactivation component must be switched off and the activation component switched\non. If we denote the probability of activation being on by m (for\nexample) and the probability of inactivation being off as h, then Table 1 gives the various channel states and their probabilities. It will\nbe seen that the sum of the probabilities in the third column of the\ntable add to unity, as they must. For more details, see, for example,\ntexts such as Levitan and Kaczmarek (1997) or Koch (1999).\n\nTable 1: Channel configurations with activation and inactivation\nActivation process\n\nInactivation process\n\nProbability\n\nConducting state\n\nOff (deactivated)\n\nOn (inactivated)\n\nNon-conducting\n\nOn (activated)\n\nOn (inactivated)\n\nOn (activated)\n\nOff (de-inactivated)\n\nOff (deactivated)\n\nOff (de-inactivated)\n\n(1 \u2212 m)(1 \u2212 h)\nm(1 \u2212 h)\nmh\n(1 \u2212 m)h\n\nNon-conducting\nConducting\nNon-conducting\n\nIn the case of voltage-gated ion channels, the activation and inactivation probabilities usually depend on voltage and time. Hence\nif V denotes membrane potential and t denotes time, then m =\nm(V, t) and h = h(V, t). As in the pioneering work of Hodgkin\nand Huxley (1952) on squid axon, the activation and inactivation\nvariables satisfy approximately differential equations whose solution\nenables one to predict reasonably accurately the ion currents flowing across nerve or other membrane. This is further elaborated on\nin Section 2.3.\n\n1.3\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels\n\nCalcium currents, which are found in all excitable cells, were divided\ninto the two main groups of low-threshold or low-voltage activated\n\n7\n\n\f(LVA) and high-threshold or high-voltage activated (HVA). The former group contains the T-type (T for transient) and the latter group\nconsists of the types L, N, P/Q and R (L for so called long-lasting,\nN, either for neither T nor L, or neuronal, P for Purkinje, and R for\nresistant). For interesting reviews of the history of the discoveries of\nthese various types and the experiments that preceded them, back\nto 1953, see Tsien and Barrett (2005) and Dolphin (2006).\nAlthough L-type currents, the main topic of the present article, were originally designated as belonging to the HVA group,\ntheir properties are diverse (Avery and Johnston, 1996; Lipscombe,\n2002), varying greatly with cell-type and ionic environment - see the\ndata below and in particular the review of Lipscombe et al. (2004).\nThey have been implicated as playing an important role in pacemaker activity in some neurons and cardiac cells (see for example,\nKamp and Hell, 2000; Mangoni et al., 2003; Brown and Piggins,\n2007; Marcantoni et al., 2007; Putzier et al., 2009a, b; Vandael et\nal., 2010) and being involved in the amplification of certain synaptic\ninputs (Bui et al., 2006).\nCalcium channel molecules have up to four subunits, \u03b11 , \u03b12 -\u03b4,\n\u03b2 and \u03b3, which may exist in different forms, and which modulate\nthe conductance and dynamical properties of the channel (Dolphin,\n2006, 2009; Davies et al., 2010). The ten forms of the conducting\npore subunit, \u03b11 , lead to an expansion of the above groups (Catterall\net al., 2005; Dolphin, 2009) to 10 main subtypes. According to\nthe accepted nomenclature, L-type channels consist of the subtypes\nCav 1.1 \u2212 Cav 1.4. The remaining \"high-threshold\" currents, P/Q, N\nand R are respectively Cav 2.1 -Cav 2.3 and the T-current subtypes\nare Cav 3.1 \u2212 Cav 3.3. Of the L-channel subtypes, sub-type Cav 1.1\nis mainly found in skeletal muscle and the subtype Cav 1.4 is found\nmainly in retinal cells (Lipscombe et al., 2004; Baumann et al., 2004;\nCatterall et al. 2005; Lacinov\u00e1, 2005; Dolphin, 2009; Weiergr\u00e4ber\net al., 2010). In cardiac myocytes and most central nervous system\ncells the subtypes are mainly Cav 1.2 or Cav 1.3. See subsection 5.1\nfor further discussion.\nIn Figure 1 is shown a recent schematic representation of the\nmolecular structure of a voltage-gated calcium channel, showing the\nsubunits \u03b11 , \u03b2 and \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b4. Note that until recently the \u03b4 subunit\nhad been thought to straddle the membrane rather than project into\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: Recent schematic of a voltage-gated calcium channel,\ntaken with permission from Davies et al.

The \u03b2 subunit is intracellular and the\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b4 subunit projects into the extracellular compartment. In this\nexample there is no \u03b3 subunit.\nthe extracellular compartment (Bauer et al., 2010; Dolphin, 2010).\nFigure 2 schematically depicts some of the structures involved in the\nimportant phenomenon of calcium-dependent inactivation, which is\nelaborated upon in Section 2.\nSince there are several different types of calcium currrent, and\nin particular high threshold ones, whose current-voltage relations\nare not completely distinguishing, in order to identify them, pharmacological methods are used. Each channel type/subtype, acts as\na receptor for specific molecules, most often toxins, leading to reduced calcium current. In some cells, R-type currents, once thought\nnot to have a specific blocker and which are borderline between\nHVA and LVA, have been more recently found to be blocked by\nthe tarantula toxin SNX-482 (Li et al.,1997; Newcomb et al.,1998).\nTable 2, adapted from Striessnig and Koschak (2008) and Catterall et al.

Note, however, that\ndihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines block all\nL-type channels to some degree.\nIt is noteworthy that one of the most important areas in which\nthe quantitative study of L-type (and other) Ca2+ currents plays\na fundamental role is in the electrophysiology of the heart. In\nmedicine, L-type calcium currents are the prime target of important calcium channel blockers such the benzothiazapine diltiazem,\nthe phenylalkylamine verapamil and the dihydropyridines such as\nnifedipine, which are used to treat, inter alia, hypertension, angina\nand cardiac arrhythmias.\nWithin the above subtypes, various configurations of other subunits lead to channels, with quite different properties (Dolphin,\n2009; Catterall, 2010). Thus, L-type Cav 1.3 variants may have\ndiffering current magnitudes and pharmacology (Andrade et al.,\n2009). One cannot therefore ascribe definite parameters in the dy10\n\n\fTable 2: Summary of pharmacological agents used\nto identify various\n \u0327 types/subtypes\nType Subtype by Agent (Example)\n\u03b11 subunit\nL\nCav 1.1\nDihydropyridines (Nifedipine)\nCav 1.2\nPhenylalkylamines (Verapamil)\nCav 1.3\nBenzothiazepines (Diltiazem)\nCav 1.4\nP/Q\nCav 2.1\n\u03c9-Agatoxin IVA\nN\nCav 2.2\n\u03c9-Conotoxin-GVIA\nR\nCav 2.3\nSNX-482\nT\nCav 3.1\nKurtoxin\nCav 3.2\nCav 3.3\nnamical description of L-type calcium currents based on the subtypes Cav 1.1 \u2212 Cav 1.4.

There are four forms\nof the \u03b2 subunit, \u03b23 and \u03b24 being highly expressed in the brain\n(Dolphin, 2003).\n1.3.1\n\nA brief background and useful references\n\nIt has become apparent that quantitative descriptions of L-type calcium currents are often a fundamental component in computational\nmodeling of neuronal and muscle cell dynamics. The first descriptions of L-type current dynamics in such a context appear to be\nthose of Belluzzi and Sacchi (1991) and McCormick and Huguenard\n(1992), although there had been many models containing calcium\ncurrents, prior to the division into the above types, for example\nfor cardiac cells. In fact Belluzzi and Sacchi's (1991) model for a\nsympathetic neuron in the rat superior cervical ganglion described\na high-threshold current which had an inactivation similar to the\nL-type of Fox et al. (1987) but an activation similar to the N-type\ncurrent.\nFor an introduction to fundamentals about ion channels see,\nfor example, Levitan and Kaczmarek (1997). Additional reviews\n11\n\n\fon voltage-dependent Ca2+ -channels pertaining to their molecular\nstructure, nomenclature and function, including modulation and\nregulation are contained in, for example, in chronological order,\nTsien et al. (1988), Bean (1989), Tsien and Tsien (1990), Anwyl\n(1991), Catterall (1995), De Waard et al. (1996), Jones (1998), Hofmann et al. (1999), Catterall (2000), Ertel et al. (2000), Kamp and\nHell (2000), Lacinov\u00e1 (2005), Zamponi (2005) and Catterall (2010).\nReviews addressing specific related topics include those on synaptic\ntransmission (Meir et al., 1999; Neher and Sakaba, 2008), T-type\ncurrents (Perez-Reyes, 2003; Cueni et al., 2009), calcium-dependent\ninactivation in neurons (Budde et al., 2002), dynamics of calcium\nsignaling in neurons (Augustine et al., 2003), models of calcium\nsparks and waves (Coombes et al, 2004), L-type currents in the\nheart (Bodi et al., 2005), the role of calcium currents in circadian\nrhythms (Brown and Piggins, 2007), calcium release and the roles\nof ryanodine receptors in heart and skeletal muscle diseases (Zalk,\n2007), Ca2+ channels in chromaffin cells (Marcantoni et al., 2008)\nand calcium dynamics in relation to absence epilepsy (Weiergr\u00e4ber\net al. 2010). Calcium ion influx through L-type channels leads via\nvarious signaling pathways to the activation of transcription factors\nsuch as CREB and hence the expression of genes that are essential for synaptic plasticity and other important cellular processes\n(Dolmetsch et al., 2001; Hardingham et al., 2001; Mori et al., 2004;\nPower and Sah, 2005; Satin et al., 2011). The role of calcium ion influx through L-type channels in immune cells has also been recently\nreviewed (Suzuki et al. 2010). It was also recently demonstrated\nthat calcium currents of L-type, together with R-type, are involved\nin the activation of SK channels, which attenuate excitatory synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex\n(Faber, 2010).\nMathematical modeling of the electrophysiology of cardiac cells\nhas a history spanning nearly the last 50 years - see for example DiFrancesco and Noble (1985) - and reviews by Noble (1995),\nWilders (2007), Fink et al. (2011) and Williams et al. (2010).\nBrette et al. (2006) reviews background physiology and biophysics\nof calcium currents in cardiac cells. The modeling has taken into account details of the dynamics of several ionic currents, particularly\ncalcium currents (as for example in Luo and Rudy, 1994). For a\n12\n\n\fdiscussion of the dynamics underlying the large difference between\nthe relatively short action potential duration in neurons and heart\ncells, see Boyett et al. (1997). In ventricular cardiomyocytes L-type\ncalcium currents play a pivotal role (Benitah et al., 2010) although\nT-type currents, important in development and in some pathologies (Ono and Iijima, 2010) are also present (Bean, 1989) and play\na role in pacemaker activity (Bers, 2008). L-type channels, located\nin the sarcolemma, are involved in arrythmias, and are activated by\ndepolarization and inactivated by both voltage-dependent and intracellular Ca2+ mechanisms. The inactivation of L-channels, which\nis elaborated upon below, is complex, not only in cardiac cells, and\nnot completely understood (Imredy and Yue, 1994; Findlay et al.\n2008; Grandi et al., 2010). See also Lacinov\u00e1 and Hofmann (2005)\nand the review of mechanisms of calcium and voltage-dependent inactivation in Cens et al. (2006). The website of David Yue (Calcium\nsignals lab) http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/csl/ contains a wealth of\ninformation about calcium dynamics.\nIn the electrophysiology of neurons and muscle cells, calcium\ncurrents usually have crucial roles. Hence there is the need to represent as accurately as possible, in mathematical or computational\nmodeling, calcium entry into cells along with related processes, such\nas buffering and pumping. The latter two topics are not explored\nin depth here, but see for example Standen and Stanfield (1982),\nBlaustein (1988), Tsien and Tsien (1990), McCormick and Huguenard (1992), Tank et al. (1995), Lindblad et al. (1996), Blaustein\nand Lederer (1999), Stokes and Green (2003), Shiferaw et al. (2003),\nRhodes and Llin\u00e1s (2005), Roussel et al. (2006), Higgins et al.\n(2007), Friel and Chiel (2008) and Brasen et al. (2010).\n\n2\n\nQuantitative description of L-type Ca2+\ncurrents\n\nWe are here concerned with deterministic approaches that have been\nemployed in the quantitative description of L-type Ca2+ currents.\nSuch descriptions are probably adequate in many preparations although it has not been found to be the case for high rates of action\npotentials in cardiac myocytes, where a many-state Markov chain\n13\n\n\fmodel, used in conjunction with the constant field method (Mahajan et al, 2008), was found to be more accurate. See also Jafri et\nal. (1998), Sun et al. (2000), Fink et al. (2011), Grandi et al.\n(2010) and Williams et al. (2010) for more details on the Markov\nchain approach for determining L-type channel-open probabilities.\nDestexhe and Sejnowski (2001) contains a brief introduction to such\nmodels, especially for voltage-dependent sodium channels. As far\nas can be discerned, until now there have been no Markov models\nof L-type calcium channels in non-cardiac cells.\n\n2.1\n\nGeneral description: VDI and CDI\n\nWhereas activation kinetics of L-type channels are voltage-dependent\n(Budde et al., 2002; Lacinov\u00e1, 2005), inactivation has often been\nfound to have dependence on both voltage and the internal \"concentration\" of calcium ions, as discovered by Brehm and Eckert\n(1978) in Paramecium and Tillotson (1979) in molluscan neurons.\nThe two components are called CDI (calcium-dependent inactivation) and VDI (voltage-dependent inactivation). A hallmark of CDI\nis that it has a maximal effect where the relevant calcium currents\nare themselves maximal. Other markers are the reduction in CDI\nif Ba2+ is the charge carrier or if the buffers EGTA or BAPTA are\npresent in the pipette (see Budde et al., 2002, for a discussion).\nThe relative contributions of CDI and VDI vary widely amongst\ncell types and modeling these contributions is not always as straightforward as in the simplified scheme presented below. Sometimes\nCDI may be absent, especially in the case of Cav 1.4 channels (Koschak\net al., 2003; Baumann et al. 2004, Singh et al., 2006; Wahl-Scott\net al., 2006; Liu et al, 2010). Indeed, often CDI is not included\nin modeling and often there is no inactivation at all, neither voltage nor calcium dependent, but it is not clear if this renders some\ncalculations inaccurate.\nIn Tables A1.1-A1.4 of the Appendix, there are given data for\nabout 65 studies, which involved L-type (or undefined high threshold calcium) currents. This survey is not exhaustive but representative of works from 1987 to the present. About half of these are\nexperimental and about half concern mathematical modeling. Some\nsalient aspects of the experimental studies are discussed in Section\n\n14\n\n\f3. Here we note that for the 24 neuronal modeling studies, 16 included no inactivation, 3 included VDI only, 3 included CDI only\nand a further 2 included both VDI and CDI. It is not clear if inactivation was omitted in several cases simply because the models\nemployed data extrapolated from other cell types or the inactivation was considered to be unimportant or extremely slow. For the 7\nmodels for cardiac cell L-type calcium currents, 2 studies included\nVDI only and 5 included both CDI and VDI. It is claimed (De\nWaard et al., 1996) that inactivation of L-type currents is generally\nslow in neurons and secretory cells but more rapid in cardiac cells.\nThe data in Table A3 indicate that this may not always be the case,\nbut the definition of the term rapid is no doubt flexible.\nGenerally, CDI has been cited as being more rapid than VDI\n(Budde et al., 2002; Lacinov\u00e1 and Hoffman, 2005; Grandi et al.,\n2010). The molecular basis of the dynamics of CDI has been an\nactive and fascinating research area in the last two decades (Imredy\nand Yue, 1992,1994; Lee et al., 1999; Peterson et al., 1999; Qin\net al., 1999; Z\u00fchlke et al., 1999; Erickson et al., 2003; Soldatov,\n2003; Bazzazi et al., 2010). It was found that calmodulin, which is\ntethered to the channel, must bind Ca2+ , as depicted in Figure 2,\nwhereupon a configurational change takes place resulting in inactivation. Crump et al. (2011) have reported that calmodulin and\nCa2+ can compete to limit CDI in Cav 1.2. The roles of the \u03b2 and\n\u03b12 \u03b4 subunits in determining the properties of Cav 1.2 channels have\nbeen discussed in Ravindran et al. (2008) and Ravindran et al.\n(2009).\nThere have been developed, since the original discovery of CDI,\ntwo main modeling ideas concerning the spatial distribution of calcium ions which participate in the inactivation process. One, called\nshell theory and posited originally by Standen and Stanfield (1982),\nis that there is a region of some 100 nm depth inside the cell membrane where calcium ions may accumulate, giving a concentration\nCa\u2217i much higher than in the remaining cytoplasm and that it is Ca\u2217i\nwhich should be used to determine the rate of CDI. This approach\nis widely used in neuronal modeling, if indeed CDI is included. The\nsecond approach, called domain theory (Sherman et al., 1990), takes\naccount of the calcium ions just inside the pore where they have entered the cell. In fact, according to Imredy and Yue (1994) and\n15\n\n\fCens et al. (2006), inactivation (CDI) can be induced in a section of membrane which contains a single L-type channel. However,\nin some cells, in a region with many channels, averaging over all\nchannels should make the often used and simpler shell approach a\nreasonable approximation.\nSpecial consideration is made for some cardiac and other muscle cells where calcium entry, principally through L-type channels,\nleads to Ca2+ -induced calcium release (CICR) of stored calcium via\nryanodine receptors and results in rapid CDI. Many articles have\naddressed the modeling of CICR and the geometrical details and the\nformation of localized increases in Cai , called calcium sparks, and\ntheir triggering of a large local increase in Cai (see for example and\nreferences therein, Shiferaw et al., 2003; Soeller and Cannell, 2004;\nKoh et al., 2006; Bers, 2008; and Groff and Smith, 2008). Many of\nthese approaches employ Markov models (Hinch et al., 2004; Shannon et al., 2004; Greenstein et al. 2006; Faber et al., 2007). Scriven\net al. (2010) have provided detailed information on the geometry\nand numbers of Cav 1.2 channels and ryanodine receptor clusters in\nrat VM which are useful in modeling Ca2+ dynamics.\nRyanodine receptors may also be coupled to L-type calcium\nchannels in some neurons so that CICR plays a role. A comprehensive review containing many examples of CICR in neurons, including\nthat involving L-type currents in the hippocampus, was compiled by\nVerkhratsky (2005). Coulon et al. (2009) report the occurrence of\nboth low threshold and high threshold calcium currents in connection with CICR in the thalamus. In bullfrog sympathetic neurons,\nAlbrecht et al. (2001) showed that small elevations of Cai evoked\nby weak depolarization lead to Cai accumulation by the endoplasmic reticulum, and that Cai accumulation became stronger after\ninhibiting CICR with ryanodine. A mathematical model was presented in support of these results. In another interesting related\nstudy, Hoesch et al. (2001) concluded that caffeine is a reliable\nagonist for CICR in rabbit vagal sensory neurons, but that caffeineactivated rises in Cai in nerve cells could not be attributed solely to\nrelease from intracellular stores. See Tsien and Tsien (1990), Friel\nand Tsien (1992), Chavis et al. (1996) and Ouyang et al. (2005)\nfor further examples and discussions of neuronal CICR.\n\n16\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe basic model for L-type Ca2+ current\n\nIn the following, the membrane potential is V , the internal calcium\nconcentration is Cai , the external calcium concentration is Cao and\nt is time. All the deterministic formulations of the L-type calcium\ncurrent employed in modeling to date are included in the general\nform\nICaL = mp1 (V, t)hp2 (V, t)f (Cai , t)F(V, Cai , Cao ),\n(1)\nwhere m(V, t) is the voltage-dependent activation variable, h(V, t)\nis the voltage-dependent inactivation variable and f (Cai , t) is the\n(internal) calcium-dependent inactivation variable. The factor F\ncontains membrane biophysical parameters and, as described below, is of the Ohmic (or linear) form (as in (15)) used in the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, or the constant-field form (as in (17) or\n(19)), often called the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz form. The values of\np1 and p2 are ideally dictated by best fits of current-voltage relations\nto experimental data. The power p1 to which m is raised, is about\nequally frequently p1 = 1 or p1 = 2, with invariably p1 = 1 for cardiac cells. For skeletal muscle, before the L-type was distinguished,\nthe value p1 = 3 was employed (Standen and Stanfield, 1982). Details are given in Tables A1.1- A1.4 in the Appendix. The value of\np2 , if indeed VDI is included, is invariably p2 = 1. (Putting p2 = 0\nimplies no VDI.) The notation fCa is often used for f and f often\nused for h, but the present notation avoids excessive subscripts in\nsubsequent formulas. If other calcium currents were under consideration, the variables for L-type current might be usefully written as\nmL , hL and fL . In some reports, L-type Ca2+ channels are described\nas being also permeable to Na+ and K+ , the relative permeabilities\nbeing given for ventricular myocytes as 2800:3.5:1 (Luo and Rudy,\n1994; Faber et al., 2007) and 3600:18:1 (Shannon et al., 2004). The\ncontributions from Na+ and K+ are evidently sufficient to bring the\nreversal potential for ICaL from its value around the Nernst potential for Ca2+ (about 120-150 mV), which it would be close to if\nit was through a purely Ca2+ -conducting channel, to the observed\nvalues of about 70 mV. However, in what follows there is no focus\non the Na+ and K+ components of the L-type current. In modeling neuronal or other cell-type dynamics, there are of course many\nother components, one of which will be the intracellular calcium\nconcentration Cai (t) whose value will directly influence ICaL , Cao (t)\n17\n\n\fusually being regarded as constant.\nEach of the variables m, h and f takes values between 0 and 1,\ninclusively, and the product mp1 hp2 f is interpretable as the probability that the channel is open or conducting or equivalently gives\nthe expected fraction of such channels in a large sample. As can\nalso be seen from Tables A1.1-A1.4, there have been many forms\nother than what might be called the full description as in Equ. (1)\nin which there there is both time-varying voltage-dependent inactivation and time-varying calcium-dependent inactivation. Thus,\nas mentioned in Section 2.1, in some computations, there is no inactivation whatsoever, or there may be just one or the other of\nvoltage-dependent or calcium-dependent inactivation, either with\nor without time dependence. Sometimes, if a time constant for an\nactivation or inactivation variable is very small, the steady state\nvalue of the variable is assumed to hold instantaneously with no\ntime dependence. With a few exceptions, this has been the case in\nmodeling calcium-dependent inactivation.\n\n2.3\n\nActivation and inactivation variables\n\nMost of the material in this subsection is standard but is repeated\nhere for notational purposes and to make the account self-contained.\nAccording to the above basic model there are three dynamical variables determining the magnitude of the current. These are the activation variable, always assumed to be purely voltage-dependent, the\nvoltage-dependent inactivation variable, and the calcium-dependent\ninactivation variable.\n2.3.1\n\nActivation variable m and voltage-dependent inactivation variable h\n\nThe activation variable m(V, t) is usually assumed to satisfy the\ndifferential equation\ndm\nm\u221e \u2212 m\n,\n(2)\n=\ndt\n\u03c4m\nwhere m\u221e (V ) is the steady state value m(V, \u221e) and \u03c4m is a time\nconstant which may depend on V . Similarly for the voltage-dependent\n\n18\n\n\finactivation variable\n\ndh\nh\u221e \u2212 h\n=\n.\n(3)\ndt\n\u03c4h\nIn the classical approach, the voltage dependence of the steady\nstate activation variable is written in the Boltzmann form\nm\u221e (V ) =\n\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212(V \u2212Vm, 1 )/km\n\n1+e\n\n2\n\nwhere V is the membrane potential. The half-activation potential is\ngiven by m\u221e (Vm, 1 ) = 0.5, and if the derivative of m\u221e is denoted by\n2\n1\n. Similarly, if a voltagem\u2032\u221e then the slope factor is km = 4m\u2032 (V\n1)\n\u221e\n\nm, 2\n\ndependent inactivation is included then its steady state form may\nbe written as\n1\n(5)\nh\u221e (V ) =\n(V \u2212Vh, 1 )/kh\n2\n1+e\n1\n.\nwhere h\u221e (Vh, 1 ) = 0.5 and the slope factor is kh = \u2212 4h\u2032 (V\n1)\n2\n\n\u221e\n\nh, 2\n\nIn many instances the Boltzmann forms are not used but rather\nforward and backward rate coefficients \u03b1(V ) and \u03b2(V ) respectively,\nare introduced, so that\ndm\n= \u03b1m (V )(1 \u2212 m) \u2212 \u03b2m (V )m\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nwith a similar equation for h. It is usually the case that m\u221e (V ) =\n\u03b1m (V )\n1\nand \u03c4m (V ) = \u03b1m (V )+\u03b2\nand similarly for the inacti\u03b1m (V )+\u03b2m (V )\nm (V )\nvation variable, but as will be seen from Table A2, variations have\nbeen employed.\nThe Boltzmann forms for m\u221e and h\u221e have the advantage of\nmaking it immediately transparent at which voltages these functions\nhave their half-maximal values and over what ranges of V they are\nsignificantly different from zero or one. If \u03b1 and \u03b2 are given, and\n(V )\nm\u221e (V ) = \u03b1m (V\u03b1m)+\u03b2\n, then one may determine an approximating\nm (V )\nBoltzmann curve by graphical inspection or calculation to ascertain\nthe V 1 and k-values.\n2\n\n2.3.2\n\nCalcium-dependent inactivation variable f (Cai , t)\n\nIt will be seen in the summary of various models presented below\nthat the inactivation variable f (Cai , t) has entered the modeling in\n19\n\n\fmany different forms. The most general, which contains all those\nemployed, can be written as\ndf\nf\u221e \u2212 f\n=\n,\ndt\n\u03c4f\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f\u221e (Cai ) is the steady state f (Cai , \u221e) and \u03c4f is a time constant which may depend on Cai . Here f\u221e and \u03c4f are defined through\nf\u221e =\n\n\u03c4f =\n\n1\n1+\n\n1\n\u0002\n\u03b1f 1 +\n\n\u0001\nCai n\nKf\n\u0001 \u0003\nCai n\nKf\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b1f , with units time\u22121 , is a constant and Kf in mM is the value\nof Cai at which the steady state inactivation has half-maximal value.\nThe index n has been given the values 1 (Standen and Stanfield,\n1982), 2 (Luo and Rudy, 1994) and 3 (Fox et al., 2002). It can\nbe argued that n, which is often referred to as a Hill coefficient, is\nthe approximate number of calcium ions which bind to a channel\nor associated molecule to give inactivation. However this reasoning\nis open to considerable doubt (Weiss, 1997). H\u00f6fer et al. (1997)\nreported that the Hill coefficient for binding of Ca2+ to the site\nmediating CDI was close to 1 with an \"inhibition constant \" of\n4\u03bcM. In the original derivation of Standen and Stanfield (1982) it\nwas assumed that the underlying reaction was in fact simply\n\u03b2f\n\nCa + R\u21cbCaR,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1f\n\nwith Kf = \u03b1f /\u03b2f . Using standard reaction rate theory (e.g. McConigle and Molinoff, 1989) this scheme gives the ratio of inactivated to activated as\n1\u2212f =\n\nCai\n.\nCai + Kf\n\n(11)\n\n(Recall that f is the interpretable as the probability that a channel\nis not inactivated by a Ca2+ -dependent mechanism.) The alternative formulation of the time-dependent behaviour in the case of n\n20\n\n\fcalcium ions binding to give an inactivated channel is through the\ndifferential equation\ndf\n= \u03b1f (1 \u2212 f ) \u2212 \u03b2f\u2217 Cai n f\n(12)\ndt\nwhere \u03b2f\u2217 = \u03b1f /Kfn which is consistent with (7)-(9). However, refinements of this basic model would be needed to incorporate other\nfindings such as the dependence of CDI on voltage in cardiac myocytes (Faber et al., 2007).\n\n2.4\n\nDetermining the current\n\nAlthough they are well-known, we give here for completeness the\ntwo most generally used methods for calculating membrane ion currents (see e.g., Tuckwell, 1988; Koch, 1999). These are the linear\nand constant field methods, of which the former is simpler. In the 22\nworks on non-cardiac cells summarized in Table A1.1, which state\nthe method of determining the current, 15 use the linear method\nand 7 use the constant field method. All cardiac cell studies in Table A1.4 use the constant field method. Although the constant field\nmethod is considered more appropriate, if the voltage doesn't spend\nmuch time above 0 then the linear method may be sufficiently accurate, especially when there is voltage-dependent inactivation, which\nis supported by the calculations in Section 4.1.\n2.4.1\n\nLinear method\n\nThis method, employed by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) in their fundamental modeling of the action potential in squid giant axon, consists of multiplying the membrane conductance GL by the driving\npotential V \u2212 Vrev,L , where Vrev,L is a reversal potential, to give\nICaL,Lin = GL (V \u2212 Vrev,L ).\n\n(13)\n\nThis method is called linear (or Ohmic), as the term V \u2212 Vrev,L is\nlinear in V , but not of course the conductance. The conductance\nGL is the product of a maximal value GL,max and one to three of\nthe factors m(V, t)p1 , h(V, t)p2 and f (Cai , t), all of which are dimensionless and take values between 0 and 1 inclusively. That is,\nGL = m(V, t)p1 h(V, t)p2 f (Cai , t)GL,max .\n21\n\n(14)\n\n\fAssuming a membrane area A sq cm, a channel density \u03c1L per\nsq cm and a single channel open conductance of g L , the maximal\nconductance is GL,max = A\u03c1L g L . Then in terms of fundamental\nquantities\nICaL,Lin = A\u03c1L g L m(V, t)p1 h(V, t)p2 f (Cai , t)(V \u2212 Vrev,L ).\n\n(15)\n\nAs can be seen from Tables A1.1-1.4, p1 and p2 are usually small\nnon-negative integers between 0 and 2 for L-type currents. If g L is\nin mS and voltages are in mV, then ICaL,Lin given by (15) is in \u03bcA.\nThe reversal potential for an ion type is often taken to be its\nNernst potential which for Ca2+ is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nCao\nRT\n(16)\nln\nVCa =\n2F\nCai\nwhere Cao and Cai are external and internal concentrations, R, T\nand F have their usual meanings, RT /F having units of volts. Although VCa is sometimes taken as the value of Vrev,L , it is usually of\nmagnitude about 120 mV, which is much higher than experimentally\ndetermined values of Vrev,L which are around 60-70 mV. In modeling, using VCa thus gives substantially larger calcium currents than\nexpected.\n2.4.2\n\nConstant field method\n\nFrom the basic expression for the current density under the constant\nfield assumption (see for example Tuckwell, 1988, Chapter 2), the\nL-type calcium current, in \u03bcA, through a membranous area of A\nsquare cm is given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation\n\u0002\n\u2212 2V \u0003\n4F V Cai \u2212 Cao e V0\nICaL,CF = APL m (V, t)h (V, t)f (Cai , t)\n,\n.\n\u2212 2V\nV0\n1 \u2212 e V0\n(17)\nwhere for convenience of expression we have defined the temperaturedependent voltage\nRT\n,\n(18)\nV0 =\nF\nF is Faraday's constant (96500 coulombs/mole), PL is the membrane permeability coefficient in cm/sec, and Cai and Cao are the\np1\n\np2\n\n22\n\n\fintracellular and extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ in mM. Note\nthat the partition coefficient, here assumed the same for the intracellular and extracellular boundaries, is absorbed into the permeability\ncoefficient. However, if the intracellular and extracellular partition\ncoefficients are different, then additional multiplicative factors will\nappear with ion concentrations, as in, for example, Sun et al. (2000)\nand Fink et al. (2011). In terms of single channel properties, the\ncurrent in \u03bcA through an area of A cm2 is\nICaL,CF =\n\n4F V\nA\u03c1L PL\u2217 mp1 (V, t)hp2 (V, t)f (Cai , t)\nV0\n\u22122\n\nwhere \u03c1L is the density of channels in cm\nchannel permeability in cm3 /sec.\n\n3\n\n.\n\n\u0002\n\u2212 2V \u0003\nCai \u2212 Cao e V0\n\nand\n\n\u2212 2V\nV\n\n1\u2212e\n\nPL\u2217\n\n0\n\n(19)\nis the single\n\nData on L-type activation and inactivation\n\nA large number of sources of data for L-type activation and inactivation, including both VDI and CDI, have been considered, back to\nthe first uses of the term \"L-type\" (Nowycky et al., 1985; Fox et al.,\n1987). Data on the half activation potentials Vm, 1 and slopes km are\n2\ngiven in Tables A1.1-A1.4. In these and all subsequent tables the\nauthorship of articles is given only by first author and date to minimize column width. In the first column of Tables A1.1-1.4 are given\ncarrier concentrations. M denotes a purely mathematical modeling\nstudy, the absence of M can denote either a purely experimental\nwork, or experimental work in conjunction with modeling. The\ncharacterization of currents as L-type by various authors has been\nassumed to be correct. Voltage-dependent inactivation parameters\nVh, 1 and kh are also given if available. Table A1.1 contains data for\n2\nneurons and secretory cells, whereas Table A1.2 is restricted to cardiac cells. In some cases, marked with asterisks (\u2217 ), parameters have\nbeen estimated approximately from data presented graphically, but\nthe original articles should be consulted for details. Table A1.3 has\ndata for neurons and secretory cells with both VDI and CDI and\nTable A1.4 presents these data for cardiac cells. In Table A1.1 the\n23\n\n\fentry for Joux et al. (2001) for Vm, 1 has two values as fits were\n2\nto a double Boltzmann function. Note that the concentrations Cao\nmay differ in the various preparations, (and occasionally be Bao ) as\ndescribed in the first column of Tables A1.1-1.4. For example, the\nvalue in the first entry (Fox et al., 1987) is Cao =10mM, which may\nexplain why the value of Vm, 1 seems rather high. In general, much\n2\nof the variability in the data presented is attributable to various\nionic carrier concentrations and differing subunit isoforms. In order\nto keep the Tables relatively simple, many such details are omitted,\nbut these can be obtained from the original sources in most cases.\n\n3.1\n\nSteady state activation m\u221e (V ) and inactivation h\u221e (V )\n\nIn the top part of Figure 3 the steady-state activation m\u221e is plotted\nagainst V for the two lowest and two highest values of the halfactivation potential found in a comprehensive, but not exhaustive,\nsearch of the literature, including all modeling and experimental\nresults in the Tables A1.1-1.4. The two lowest are for midbrain\ndopamine neurons, with half-activation potentials of -50 mV (Amini\net al., 1999; Komendantov et al., 2004).\nThe two highest are +5 mV for ventricular myocytes (Shiferaw\net al., 2003) and +2 mV for chick dorsal root ganglion (Fox et al.\n1987). Also shown in the top part of the figure are examples of the\nm\u221e curves found for the channel subtypes Cav 1.1-Cav 1.4. It can\nbe seen that the curves for the subtypes cover or span those for the\nlowest and highest activation curves for cells except for the one for\nmidbrain dopamine neurons.\nIn the lower part of Figure 3 are shown the corresponding steady\nstate V-dependent inactivation h\u221e curves for the two highest halfactivation potentials. For the other two cases with Vm, 1 =-50, there\n2\nwas only CDI. Also shown in the lower part of Figure 3 are the\nh\u221e curves for each channel subtype. The curve for Cav 1.2 seems\nmore extreme than that for any cell. In some cases Boltzmann\nfunctions for m\u221e (V ) and h\u221e (V ) were not given but rather explicit\nexpressions for the forward and backward rate functions \u03b1m (V ),\n\u03b2m (V ), \u03b1h (V ) and \u03b2h (V ). Such formulas when available are given\nfor all cell types in Table A3. The parameters of fitted Boltzmann\n24\n\n\fFigure 3: Steady state activation m\u221e and inactivation h\u221e versus membrane potential for L-type currents in neurons for extreme\ncases. Top panel. Activation curves m\u221e (V ) are given for L-type\ncurrents in midbrain DA neurons, (blue solid curve, Amini et al.,\n1999; red solid curve, Komendantov et al., 2004) chick DRG (green\nsolid curve, Fox et al., 1987) and rabbit atrial myocytes (black solid\ncurve, Lindblad et al., 1996). These are the cases with the two\nhighest and two lowest half-activation potentials found in the literature. The two lowest (midbrain DA) have Vm, 1 =-50 mV, and\n2\nthe highest two are for rabbit atrial cell, with Vm, 1 =-0.95 mV and\n2\nchick DRG with Vm, 1 =2 mV. Also given are examples of activation\n2\ncurves (dashed) for the four subtypes, Cav 1.1 (green, from Catterall, 2005), Cav 1.2 (blue, average from Lipscombe et al., 2004 and\nCatterall, 2005), Cav 1.3 (red, average from Lipscombe et al., 2004\nand Helton et al., 2005) and Cav 1.4 (black, mean of lowest and\nhighest, from Catterall, 2005). Bottom panel. Steady state inactivation h\u221e (V ) for cases shown in the top panel with the same color\ncoding. For the two cells with the lowest two half-activation potentials, inactivation was given only as Ca2+ -dependent - see Tables\nA1.1-A1.4.\n\n25\n\n\ffunctions for the corresponding m\u221e and h\u221e were given in Tables\nA1.1-A1.4. When explicit expressions were given for the activation\ntime constants \u03c4m (V ), these are given in Table A4.\n3.1.1\n\nDistribution of half-activation potentials\n\nIt can be seen from Tables A1.1-A1.4 that there is great variability\nin the parameters for the activation and inactivation properties of\nL-type currents in various cells. The underlying reasons for variability include, (a) the occurrence of different subtypes of L-channels,\nsome examples of whose properties are listed in Table A6; (b) the\nvarious locations of the channels over the soma-dendritic surface;\n(c) the interaction of L-type channels with other neighboring ionic\nchannels; and (d) the ionic compositions of the intracellular and extracellular compartments of the cell under consideration. One other\nsource of variability is that there are different methods, some more\naccurate than others, for calculating Boltzmann curves.\nThe majority of data in tables A1.1-A1.4 concerns modeling\nstudies and it is useful to separate out the experimental values,\nand to subdivide these into those for neurons and cardiac cells. In\nparticular, the experimental results considered here are only those\nfor calcium concentrations in the physiological range because high\nconcentrations of either barium or calcium ions can shift the halfactivation potential in the depolarizing direction by 10 or more mV\n(Jaffe et al., 1994; Muinuddin et al., 2004). With these restrictions\nthere are 13 half-activation potentials given for neurons and 5 for\ncardiac cells. Histograms for the Vm, 1 values are shown in Figure\n2\n4. For neurons, the data are divided into a high (> \u221230 mV) and\na low group, the topmost panel being for the low group. The mean\nfor the neuron high group is < Vm, 1 >= \u221218.3 mV whereas that\n2\nfor the low group is < Vm, 1 >= \u221236.4 mV. The mean slope factors\n2\nfor these two groups of neurons are < km >= 8.4 mV for the high\ngroup and < km >= 5.8 mV for the low group. These average slope\nfactors are obtained on omitting the outliers 2.45 in the high group\nand 20.0 in the low group. The mean value of Vm, 1 for the exper2\niments with cardiac cells is -13.6 mV with a standard deviation of\n7.8 mV, and the corresponding average km is 6.84 mV with standard\ndeviation 1.61 mV. It is then of interest to note that the average\nvalues of the half activation potentials for Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3, using\n26\n\n\f4\n3\n\nNEURONS LOW\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u221260\n\n\u221250\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n4\nNEURONS HIGH\n2\n\n0\n\u221260\n\n\u221250\n\n4\nCARDIAC\n2\n\n0\n\u221260\n\n\u221250\n\nV (mV)\n\nFigure 4: Histograms of the half-activation membrane potentials\nVm, 1 for L-type Ca2+ currents from the data of Tables A1.1-A1.4.\n2\nThe data, which are based on selected experiments (see text) are\ndivided into 3 groups. Top, low neuron group. Middle, high neuron\ngroup. Bottom, cardiac cells. Note that the mean values for Cav 1.2\nand Cav 1.3, using Table A6 values with physiological calcium ion\nconcentrations, are -18.7 mV and -38.9 mV, respectively.\nTable A6 values with physiological calcium ion concentrations, are\n-18.7 mV and -38.9 mV, respectively. These values correspond well\nwith the mean values of the high and low groups of neurons. The\nvalues for cardiac cells tend to be higher than those in even the\nhigh neuron group, but the sample sizes are too small to draw any\nstatistically significant conclusions.\nFor all the 25 neuronal modeling studies the mean value of Vm, 1\n2\nis -21.0 mV with a standard deviation of 12.21 mV, and for km the\nmean is 7.26 with a standard deviation of 2.33. The mean modeling\nstudy parameters correspond roughly to the experimental values for\nthe high neuron group. For the 7 cardiac cell (all kinds) modeling\nstudies the mean half-activation potential Vm, 1 is -8.8 mV with a\n2\nstandard deviation of 9.1 mV and the corresponding mean for km\n27\n\n\fis 6.4 mV with a standard deviation of 0.52.\nFor the parameters of the Boltzmann function for the steady\nstate inactivation, Vh, 1 and kh , there are, unfortunately little ap2\npropriate experimental data, and none which could be considered\nreliable, though many modeling studies have employed estimates\n(see Tables A1.1-A1.4) and see below. In order to provide crude\nestimates based on experiment, one may use the results of Koschak\net al. (2001) as given in Table A6 for the differences in voltage\nbetween Vm, 1 and Vh, 1 for Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 in high barium con2\n2\ncentration. This procedure yields values which are summarized in\nTable 3 for the activation and inactivation parameters.\n\nTable 3: Parameters for L-type steady state\nactivation and inactivation\n \u0327\nin neurons\nHigh neuron Low neuron All models\ngroup (expt) group (expt)\nVm, 1\n-18.7\n-38.9\n-21.0\n2\nkm\n8.4\n5.8\n7.26\nVh, 1\n-42.0\u2217\n-61.9\u2217\n-38.95\n2\nkh\n13.8\u2217\n6.6\u2217\n6.82\n\u2217\n\nEstimated \u0327 - see text.\n\nFor cardiac cells, based on the few experimental studies available,\nthe mean Vh, 1 is -40.0 mV with standard deviation 12.8, the corre2\nsponding mean value of kh being 6.85 mV with a standard deviation\nof 2.04 mV.\nOf the 25 neuronal modeling studies in the tables, only 6 included VDI and these yielded a mean value of -38.95 mV for Vh, 1\n2\nwith standard deviation 14.29. For the corresponding values of the\nslope factor kh , the mean is 6.82 with a standard deviation of 2.16,\nwhere one value is omitted as an extreme outlier. For the cardiac\nmodeling, the mean value of Vh, 1 is -30.1 mV with a standard devi2\nation of 10.9 mV and the corresponding mean for kh is 6.1 mV with\na standard deviation of 2.00 mV.\n\n28\n\n\f3.2\n\nTime constants \u03c4m (V ) for activation\n\nSome values of \u03c4m (V ) for activation, with corresponding inactivation, if available, are reported in Table A3. This table has been\ndivided into a part with experimental results and a part on values\nof which have been employed in modeling studies. As seen in Table\nA3-Experimental, there are not many explicit experimental results\navailable for the time constants of activation (or inactivation) of Ltype Ca2+ currents. In neurons values of \u03c4m (V ) range from about\n0.5 ms in sympathetic neurons (Belluzzi and Sacchi, 1991) to 2.3\nms in hippocampal pyramidal cells (Avery and Johnston, 1996), a\nmaximum value of 1.541 ms being reported for thalamic relay cells\n(McCormick and Huguenard, 1992). These values seem compatible with those given for the appropriate subtypes in Table 6. For\nskeletal muscle, a value of 19.82 ms (Standen and Stanfield, 1982;\nhere assuming L-type) is also compatible with the relatively high\nvalue for the Cav 1.1 subtype. The experimental values reported for\nsmooth muscle are around 4.0 ms (Muinuddin et al., 2004). Some\navailable data for \u03c4m for subtypes are given in Section 5.\nIn Table A3-Modeling, there are reported 23 values employed\nfor \u03c4m , with a large range of values, many of which are much larger\nthan the values for subtypes reported in Table 6. Many of the values\nemployed for a given neuron type are not based on experiments for\nthat neuron type but adapted from those for other, sometimes quite\ndifferent, neurons. Often quite disparate values appear for what are\npossibly the same kind of cell. Discrepancies may arise because it is\ndifficult to categorize a specific channel type in a neuron without a\ndetailed voltage-clamp and pharmacological analysis. We consider\ncells in the following categories.\nDopaminergic neurons. The value of about 0.134 ms was employed\nby (Li et al., 1996) which contrasts greatly with the value 19.5 ms\nused by both Amini et al. (1999) and Komendantov et al. (2004).\nThe approach of Li et al. (1996) is critically discussed by Amini et\nal. (1999).\nCardiac cells. Concerning the listed values, in the three modeling\nstudies on ventricular myocytes, two (Luo and Rudy, 1994; Shannon et al., 2004) have \u03c4m -values with a maximum around 2.25 ms\nwhereas a third puts the maximum value much higher at about 19.3\n\n29\n\n\fms (Fox et al., 2002) and at a considerably more hyperpolarized\nlevel. In their analysis of the firing properties of rabbit sino-atrial\nnode pacemakers, Zhang et al. (2000) chose a value of about 3.8 ms\nfor the maximum activation time constant. Thus in most of these\nstudies the magnitudes of \u03c4m are comparable with or near the values\nfor Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 channels (see Table 6) which are plentiful in\nthe heart.\nHippocampal cells. The range of activation time constants for hippocampal pyramidal cell models is from 0.83 ms for CA1 (Poirazi\net al., 2003) to 4.56 ms for CA3 (Migliore et al., 1995). For the\nlatter cell-type, Jaffe et al. (1994) used a value with a maximum of\n1.5 ms. According to Table 6 and Figure 12 all of these values are\nwithin the ranges of the ones given for Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 channels,\nboth of which are prevalent in the hippocampus.\nThalamic relay cells. The experimental findings of McCormick and\nHuguenard (1992) for \u03c4m , with a maximum of 1.541 ms at V = \u221215\nmV, were implemented in a model by the same authors. The same\nvalues were later employed by Hutcheon et al. (1994). Rhodes and\nLlinas (2005) put the maximum value of the time constant somewhat larger at 2.1 ms at -19 mV, but in the table of parameter\nvalues the current is referred as a generic ICa rather than specifically as an L-type current. All of these values are compatible with\nthe expected subtype values.\nPituitary corticotrophs. The two modeling studies of these cells\nlisted in the table have fairly large values of \u03c4m . In the first study,\nLeBeau et al. (1997) set the value at 27 ms for all V , whereas\nShorten and Wall (2000) had a maximum for \u03c4m of value 11.32 occurring at V = \u221212 mV. There seems to be a fairly large difference\nbetween these values and the sub-type values, but there are many\nsources of variability as discussed elsewhere in this review.\nCortical pyramidal cells. In the one parameter set available (Rhodes\nand Llinas, 2001), the maximal time constant for L-type activation\nwas set at 2.1 ms, occurring at -19 mV. This value is well within the\nrange of the available data for the appropriate subtypes as given in\nTable 6 and Figure 12.\nSpinal motoneurons. The L-type activation listed in the 3 listed\n30\n\n\fmodeling studies of these neurons (Booth et al, 1997; Carlin et al.\n2000; Bui et al, 2006) is much slower than the values available for\neither of the subtypes Cav 1.2 Cav 1.3 which are candidates for being\npresent in CNS neurons. The first of these studies set \u03c4m = 40\nms, whereas the two subsequent ones put \u03c4m = 20 ms whereas the\nlargest value in Figure 12 is about 4 to 5 ms.\nSmooth muscle. In modeling a rat mesenteric smooth muscle cell,\nKapela et al. (2008) for \u03c4m (V ) used a Gaussian-like function with\na maximum value of 3.65 ms at V = \u221240 mV. Such a value is close\nto the experimentally reported time constant in (Muinuddin et al.,\n2004).\nFigure 5 shows two plots of \u03c4m versus V for two of the few\navailable experimental data sets (but see Section 5 for results for\nL-subtypes).These are both for rat sympathetic neurons (A, Belluzzi and Sacchi, 1991; B, Sala, 1991) and are, in the absence of\nreliable L-type data in physiological or near physiological solutions,\n1\n0.8\nms\n(\u03c4)\n\nm\u221e\n\nA\n\n0.6\n\u03c4m\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\u2212100\n\n\u221280\n\n\u221260\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221220\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n40\n\n60\n\n1\n0.8\nms\n(\u03c4)\n\nm\u221e\n\nB\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\u03c4m\n\n0.2\n0\n\u2212100\n\n\u221280\n\n\u221260\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221220\n\n0\n\n20\n\nV (mV)\n\nFigure 5: Activation time constants for high threshold Ca2+ currents.

These data sets are very different in magnitude and form from those used in many modeling studies, where\nsometimes the time constant for activation is taken to be a large\nvalue, constant and independent of voltage. They are also considerably less than the values reported for Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 in 2mM\nCa2+ in Section 5. Molitor and Manis (1999) report experimental\nvalues of \u03c4m with a maximum of about 1.2 ms at about V=-20 mV\nin guinea pig dorsal cochlear nucleus neurons. In Figure 5 are also\ndrawn the steady state activation functions, also based on experiment, for comparison.\nThe data of Table A3 on maximum values of activation time\nconstants are collected into a histogram in Figure 6, but this includes only values less than 10 ms. The mean for the experimental\nresults on neurons is 1.34 ms. For all the data shown (n=17) the\nmean is 2.38 ms and the standard deviation is 1.51.\nFor time constants \u03c4h for voltage dependent inactivation in neurons there are very few data. The average of the two available ex32\n\n\fperimental maximum values is 65 ms and the average of 5 modeling\nmaximum values is 140.9 ms.\n\n3.3\n\nMagnitudes of ICaL or related quantities\n\nData on the magnitudes of ICaL in various cells is collected in Table\nA5. Such data are presented in several forms, viz, (a) the actual\ncurrent density, usually in pA/pF, which may be for the whole cell\nor a part thereof (b) the permeability (c) the conductance per unit\narea gL (d) the whole cell conductance GL (d) the fraction of total\ncalcium current that is ICaL . It can be seen that the proportion of\nICaL across cell types is extremely variable from nearly all of the\ncalcium current in some muscle and cardiac cells (Kapela et al.,\n2008; Benitah et al., 2010) to just a few percent, for example in\nserotonergic (dissociated) cells of the dorsal raphe nucleus (Penington et al., 1991). The roles of ICaL are presumably very different in\nthese examples. From Table A5, the largest ICaL current density is\n19.3 pA/pF in supraoptic nucleus (Joux et al., 2001), but almost\nas high magnitudes are found in rat CA1 pyramidal cells (Xiang et\nal., 2008) and ventricular cardiomyocytes in rats with renal failure\n(Donohoe et al, 2000). The highest reported conductance density\nis 7 mS per square cm in rat CA1 pyramidal cells (Xiang et al.,\n2008). Note that current densities can differ significantly in different preparations such as those with different ages, or with different\ntimes in culture.\n\n4\n\nExamples of calculations of ICaL\n\nIn this Section we apply the basic model (1) to determine the L-type\ncalcium current in three cases. In the first, only VDI is considered,\nwhereas in the remaining two examples, VDI and CDI are both\noperative.\n\n33\n\n\f4.1\n\nSteady state currents obtained by the linear and constant field methods with voltage\ndependence only\n\nThe activation and inactivation variables, which are dimensionless\nand take values in [0,1], may depend on membrane potential or ion\nconcentrations, or both, but in this section only voltage dependence\nis considered. Here we wish to compare current-voltage relations\nobtained by the two methods outlined in Section 2.4. In order to\ncompare the steady state currents ICaL,Lin and ICaL,CF calculated by\nthe two methods, an average maximal conductance density gL (from\nthe values given in Table A5) of 1.3925 mS/cm2 was assumed for\nthe determination of ICaL,Lin , although this value varies greatly from\ncell to cell. For the steady state activation variable m\u221e used in the\ncalculation of ICaL,Lin , two values of Vm, 1 were employed, being a\n2\nrelatively low value, Vm, 1 = \u221229.6 mV, and an intermediate value\n2\nVm, 1 = \u221214.4 mV. The corresponding values of km were 6.97 mV\n2\n(low) and 7.78 (intermediate). When inactivation was included, the\nvalues for Vh, 1 were Vh, 1 = \u221243.5 mV (low) and Vh, 1 = \u221236.2 mV\n2\n2\n2\n(intermediate), with corresponding values for kh of 9.55 mV (low)\nand 6.18 (intermediate).\nFour sets of values for p1 and p2 were employed, giving the forms\nm, m2 , mh and m2 h. The calculated results are shown in the four\npanels of Figure 7. In each case the current ICaL,Lin (linear method)\nwas calculated first, the temperature being set at 25o C, the internal\ncalcium concentration Cai fixed at 100 nM and the external concentration Cao fixed at 2 mM, giving VCa = 128.4 mV which was used\nas the reversal potential. The constant field current ICaL,CF was\nthen calculated and the permeability adjusted to make the peak\n(inward, negative) current the same as that in the linear case. This\ngave 8 values of the permeability which are listed in Table 4 which\nare close to those reported for L-type calcium currents (Hutcheon\net al., 1994; Luo and Rudy, 1994).\nThe following can be seen from the results in Figure 7. Details\nof the values of V at which minima in ICaL (maximal current amplitude) occur are given in Table 5. Firstly, without inactivation\n(top two panels), as expected, the constant field and linear calculations are similar in magnitude until a value of V just greater than\n34\n\n\fthat at which the minimum of ICaL (maximum amplitude) occurs.\nHowever, the minima in the constant field case occur at voltages\nabout 11-13 mV more negative than for the linear case, both for\nopen probabilities given by m or m2 and whether Vm, 1 is ascribed\n2\nthe low or high value. For larger values of V the two calculations\n\nFigure 7: Calculated asymptotic steady state (t = \u221e) currents\nfor L-type Ca2+ currents with average activation and inactivation\nproperties for a relatively low voltage activation (Vm, 1 = \u221229.7\n2\nmV), blue curves, and an intermediate value (Vm, 1 = \u221214.4 mV),\n2\nred curves. The solid curves are for the constant field current (formula (17)) and dashed lines are for the linear current case (formula\n(15)). The top two panels are for activation only (m and m2 ) and\nthe bottom two panels are for activation with inactivation (mh and\nm2 h). In each of the 8 sets of curves, the maximum amplitudes of\nthe constant field and linear currents are scaled to be equal, for a\nconductance density of 1.3925 mS/cm2 in the linear case.

Furthermore, there is not a\nlarge difference in the magnitude of the current between the low and\nhigh Vm, 1 cases. Secondly, with inactivation (bottom two panels)\n2\n\nTable 5: Membrane potentials in mV at maximal current amplitude\nVm, 1 =-29.7 mV\nVm, 1 =-14.4 mV\n2\n2\nLinear Const Field Linear Const Field\nm\n-9\n-20\n6.5\n-7\n2\nm\n-4\n-15\n12\n-1\nmh -32\n-35\n-32\n-34\nm2 h -25\n-27\n-18\n-21\nthe current/voltage relations are practically symmetric for all combinations of Vm, 1 and the factors mh and m2 h. Thus, the constant\n2\nfield calculations are practically the same as the linear calculations\nfor all values of V . Inactivation, either as mh or m2 h shifts the\nvoltage of maximal current amplitude by very large amounts in the\nhyperpolarizing direction. The smallest shift is -12 mV with m2 h\nand the constant field calculation and the largest is -30 mV with\nm2 h and the linear calculation. The magnitudes of the currents are\n36\n\n\freduced by an order of magnitude by the inactivation and the reductions are much greater for the higher value of Vm, 1 (red curves). The\n2\ndifference for the linear and constant field results for the voltage of\nmaximal current amplitude is only a few mV.\n\n4.2\n\nTime dependent ICaL for high and low group\nneurons with VDI: m or m2 ?\n\nThe question arises as to when the time-dependent results for an mh\nform of current differ significantly from those for an m2 h form. This\nwas investigated using the parameters for steady state activation\nand inactivation for the two sets called high and low summarized\nin Table 3.\nThe time constant of activation was set at the average maximal\nexperimental value of 1.34 ms for neurons and the time constant\nfor inactivation was set at 29.9 ms as found in Belluzzi and Sacchi\n(1991), this being one of the only two experimental values available.\nCurrent flows were computed for voltage steps from an initial value\nV0 = \u221280 mV to final values V1 = \u221230 mV and V1 = 0 mV. The\nfollowing Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) formula may then be applied\nI(t; V0 , V1 ) = g L (V1 \u2212 Vrev,L )[m1 \u2212 (m1 \u2212 m0 )e\u2212t/\u03c4m ]p\n\u00d7 [h1 \u2212 (h1 \u2212 h0 )e\u2212t/\u03c4h ],\nwhere we have employed the abbreviations m0 = m\u221e (V0 ), m1 =\nm\u221e (V1 ) for the activation, h0 = h\u221e (V0 ), h1 = h\u221e (V1 ) for the inactivation, \u03c4m and \u03c4h being the time constants. For these calculations\ng L was set at unity as only relative magnitudes are of interest.\nThe results are shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that in most\nof the examples shown, there are only minor differences in the currents computed by the mh versus m2 h form. The case where the\ndifference is very significant (plot 8A) is for the high neuron group\nwith a voltage step from - 80 mV to -30 mV. However, only a detailed neuron model, which is beyond the scope of this article, could\nascertain whether significant differences arise in the ongoing spiking\nactivity when L-type currents are one of an array of current types.\nNevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the choice of the form\nof the open probability contribution from voltage dependent terms,\nmp1 hp2 , can have significant consequences for the current/voltage\n37\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221240\nA\n\n\u221215\n\u221220\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nC\n\n\u221260\n\u221280\n0\n\n200\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nI(t)\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\u221220\n\n\u221220\n\u221230\n\nB\n\n\u221240\n\nD\n\n\u221240\n\u221250\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n\u221260\n0\n\n200\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nt in ms\n\nFigure 8: In all plots, current in arbitrary units versus time in ms.\nBlue curves are for p = 1 and red curves are for p = 2.

In the ideal situation voltageclamp data for both activation and inactivation would be used to\nfind the best fitting theoretical form for a component current, as\nin the original Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) analysis. Care is required\nin reporting parameters for activation and functions so that it is\nclear whether they are for m or m2 . It is also important that the\nexperimental data have been analyzed correctly.\n\n38\n\n\f4.3\n\nTwo time constants in ICaL inactivation\n\nFor L-type calcium current inactivation, most reports indicate that\nthere are two time constants, one fast and one slow (Luo and Rudy,\n1994; Romanin et al., 2000; Meuth et al., 2001; Budde et al., 2002;\nLacinova and Hoffman, 2005; Faber et al., 2007; Findlay et al.,\n2008). According to Lacinova and Hoffman (2005), such is the case\nfor smooth muscle, ventricular myocytes, several neurons and the\nCav 1.2 channel. Furthermore, in cells, fast time constants range\nfrom 7 to 50 ms and slow ones from 65 to 400 ms whereas for the\nCav 1.2 channel, the ranges are 20 to 100 (fast) and 160 to 2000\n(slow). See Table A3 for several data although no distinction is\nmade between fast and slow inactivation time constants in the cited\nworks. In an earlier study of calcium currents (not specifically stated\nas L-type) in CA1 pyramidal cells, Kay (1991) found, with 5mM\nCa2+ , a fast time constant with a maximum value of about 240 ms\nat V=-10 mV, and a slow time constant with a maximum of about\n2200 ms at V=-11 mV. It was pointed out that typically (in cells\nwithout CDI) the amount of inactivation increases with increasing\nV, and that the rate of inactivation tends to be Gaussian-like as a\nfunction of V, with a maximum around the voltage Vh, 1 at which\n2\nthe steady state inactivation is half-maximal.\nThe relative contributions of CDI and VDI vary. Lacinova and\nHoffman (2005) state that in general for a brief pulse, CDI is responsible for about 80% of inactivation and VDI responsible for the\nremaining 20%. The faster time constant is usually taken to be\nassociated with CDI. However, in some cases there are taken to be\ntwo time constants for VDI of L-type Ca currents, such as in ventricular myocytes (Faber et al., 2007; Findlay et al., 2008) where the\ndichotomy is attributed to the existence of two voltage-dependent\ninactivation states. Two time constants were also demonstrated by\nMorad and Soldatov (2005) for barium currents with no CDI for\nCav 1.2.\nTo illustrate the occurrence of two time constants we show results obtained for ICaL for the basic model of Equation (1) using\nthe constant field expression for the current. These are designed to\nbe comparable to the experimental results on thalamic relay (LGN)\nneurons in Budde et al. (2002), where a step to a test voltage of 10\nmV is made for 800 ms after holding at -60 mV. The parameters\n39\n\n\fFigure 9: Showing two time constants for calculated L-type Ca2+\ncurrents evoked by a test pulse of duration 800 ms at 10 mV after a\nholding potential of -60 mV. The blue curves are for CDI and VDI,\nwhereas the red curves are for no CDI. The figure on right shows\nclearly the change in time constant from early to late (blue curve)\ncompared with the single time constant for VDI only (red curve).\nused were as follows. For activation, Vm, 1 was set at -37.5 mV with\n2\nslope factor 5 mV, and for voltage-dependent inactivation, Vh, 1 was\n2\nset at -59.5 mV with a slope factor of 10 mV. The time constant\nfor activation was given by\n\u2212[(V \u2212Vm, 1 )/15]2\n\n\u03c4m = 1 + 2e\n\n2\n\n(20)\n\nand that for VDI was set at \u03c4h = 300 ms for all V . In addition, a\ncalcium pump term was added of the form\nfpump (Cai ) = Kc\n40\n\nCai\nCai + Kp\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere Kp = 0.0005 mM (Rhodes and Llin\u00e1s, 2005) and Kc =\n0.000002. Initial internal calcium concentration was set at 70 nM\nand extracellular at 2mM. The standard value of the multiplicative\nfactor A\u03c1L PL\u2217 in (19) was chosen to make the maximum amplitude\nof ICaL about 0.2 nA as in Budde et al. Figure 2. For the CDI term\nwe use the standard model (7) and (8) with n = 1, \u03c4f = 10 ms\n(constant) and Kf = 0.0002 mM.\nResults are shown for ICaL in Figure 9, the contribution from\nthe pump being small and not included. During the pulse the internal calcium concentration rose to a maximum of about 300 nM.\nIn the left panel, ICaL is plotted against time in the cases of CDI\n+ VDI (blue curve) and for VDI only (red curve). With CDI the\ninitial decline of current is very rapid and merges into a slower decay after about 100 ms; with VDI only, the decline in current is\nslow and relatively uniform as can be seen in the right hand panel\nwhere ln(\u2212ICa,L ) is plotted against time to reveal changes in time\nconstant. The curve for VDI is a straight line, indicating a single\ntime constant. The early (fast) time constant for CDI + VDI was\napproximately 49 ms and the slow time constant about 264 ms.\nBoth of these values are in the ranges given by Lacinova and Hoffman (2005) quoted above. They are also similar in magnitudes to\nthe values reported in Budde et al. (2002).\n4.3.1\n\nEffects of varying parameters\n\nThe effects of varying several parameters on the inactivation of ICaL\naccording to the above test pulse procedure are shown in Figure\n10. Here both CDI and VDI are present, but the graphical results\nare given only for the first 200 ms. The parameters used here are\nas given by Rhodes and Llin\u00e1s (2005) as in Table A1.3, using the\nsame f\u221e , but with time dependent f (Cai , t). The standard set of\nparameters is taken to be as for Figure 9, with the following variations. In the top left panel, the current is calculated for four values\nof the CDI time constant \u03c4f , being 5, 10, 30 and 100 ms. Note that\nmost modeling of L-type currents effectively takes \u03c4f = 0 (see Table\nA1.3), as the steady state is assumed to be attained immediately.\nWhen \u03c4f is 5 or 10 ms (blue and red curves), the current has almost\nthe same time course as it does when the immediate steady state\nassumption is made. For \u03c4f = 30 ms (green curve), which is the\n41\n\n\fvalue used by Standen and Stanfield (1982), the decay of current\nis much slower for the first 100 ms, very different from that for the\nimmediate steady state assumption. For \u03c4f = 100 ms (black curve),\nthe decline does not reach values comparable with the remaining\nthree cases for at least 200 ms. In the top right panel are shown\nICaL for four values of the time constant \u03c4h for voltage-dependent\ninactivation, no dependence on V being assumed. The value of \u03c4f\nis set at 10 ms. Results are shown for time constants \u03c4h (in ms) of\n100 (blue), 200 (red), 300 (green) and 400 (black), which values encompass approximately the values employed (Table A3). As could\nbe anticipated, increasing \u03c4h from 100 to 400 has a negligible effect\nfor the first 20 ms but quite noticeable effects on the late current.\nIn the bottom left panel are shown results of varying the parameter Kc which determines the rate of calcium pumping as in (21).\nThe values employed are 1,2,3 and 10 times a base rate with blue,\nred, green and black curves respectively. When the pump rate is\nhigher, Ca2+ is less available for CDI so the current has a larger\nmagnitude. However, in the situation modeled here, it can be seen\nthat a significant difference in ICaL occurs when the pump rate is\nincreased tenfold, but that increases of 100% and 200% have only a\nsmall effect. Finally, in the bottom right panel are shown the time\ncourses of ICaL for various channel densities, being 1 (blue), 4 (red),\n8 (green) and 12 (black) times a base rate. The current amplitude is\nassumed proportional to the channel density so the higher channel\ndensities result in more effective CDI. These results indicate that\nthese four quantities have a significant influence on the amounts of\nCDI and VDI and thus the magnitude and time course of ICaL .\n4.3.2\n\nCICR\n\nIf there is a substantial amount of CICR, as occurs in cardiac and\nother muscle cells, then there may be two phases of CDI, consisting of an early rapid component due to release of Ca2+ from the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum and then a slower phase in response to calcium ion entry through L-type channels (or other calcium channels)\n(Budde et al., 2002; Bodi et al., 2005; Cueni et al., 2009; Empson\net al., 2010). This raises the possibility of three time constants\nin the decay of ICaL , two for the two phases of CDI and one for\nVDI, or even four time constants if as mentioned above there are\n42\n\n\fFigure 10: The effects of changing 4 parameters on the time course\nof the L-type calcium current when there are both CDI and VDI.\nTop left: the time constant \u03c4f for CDI is varied. Values in ms are\n5 (blue), 10 (red), 30 (green) and 100 (black). Top right: the time\nconstant \u03c4h of VDI is varied. Values in ms are 100 (blue), 200 (red),\n300 (green) and 400 (black). Bottom left: The effects of various\ncalcium pump strengths Kc on ICaL - see Equation (21). Values of\nKc are 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green) and 10 (black) times a base rate of\n0.000001. Bottom right: How the channel density \u03c1L , through the\nmagnitude of the current, affects ICaL . The multiplicative factor\nA\u03c1L PL\u2217 has values 0.25 (blue), 1 (red), 2 (green) and 3 (black) times\nthe base rate, where the base rate is the standard value described\nfor the previous figure.\ntwo for VDI. The effect of Ca2+ released from sarcoplasmic reticulum is graphically illustrated in Hinch et al. (2004). The basic\nmodel (1) can incorporate the influence of CICR on CDI by taking account of the time-course of the Ca2+ concentration, as stated\n\n43\n\n\fin Section 2.1. This quantity will usually be obtained from either\nordinary (for Cai (t)) or partial differential equations (for Cai (x, t),\nwhere x is from 1 to 3 space variables) which incorporate calcium\nion concentration changes due to pumping and buffering as well as\nfluxes through various channels. See Luo and Rudy (1994) for such\na deterministic example. A detailed stochastic model for CICR in\ncardiac myocytes has been analyzed by Williams et al. (2007).\n\n4.4\n\nCalculations for double-pulse protocols\n\nAccording to Budde et al. (2002), CDI tends to be rapid and results\nin a \"U-shaped\" inactivation curve when investigated using a double\npulse protocol (Tillotson, 1979; Kay, 1991; Meuth et al., 2001).\nWe show corresponding results for the standard model for L-type\ncalcium currents as described in section 2. The voltage is held at a\n\"conditioning\" value, VCON D followed by a pause and then a \"test\"\npulse at VT EST is delivered. Of interest is the relationship between\nthe first and second responses. As in Figure 1 of Budde et al. (2002),\nmathematically we have\n\uf8f1\nV1 ,\n0 \u2264 t < t1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nt1 \u2264 t < t2 ,\n\uf8f2 VCON D ,\nV (t) =\n(22)\nV1\nt2 \u2264 t < t3 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nVT EST\nt3 \u2264 t < t4 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nV1\nt \u2265 t4 .\n\nWe use the constant field method and assume, as the results of\nSection 4.2 indicate a relative insensitivity to the power of m,\nICaL = F(V, Cai , Cao )m2 (V, t)h(V, t)f (Cai , t)\n\n(23)\n\nwhere F contains physical constants and the constant field factor as\ngiven by (17). For the CDI term we use (7) and (8) with n = 1,\n\u03c4f = 30 mS (constant) and Kf = 0.0005 mM.\nFor the voltage-dependent activation and inactivation parameters we use the two sets for thalamic relay cells as given by Pospischil et al. (2008) (see Table A1.1) and Rhodes and Llin\u00e1s (2005)\n(see Table A1.3). The time constant for activation was chosen as\nin Equation (20), and the inactivation time constant was set at\n\u03c4h = 500 ms for all V .\n44\n\n\fFigure 11: Calculated L-type calcium currents in the two-pulse protocol described in the text using the standard model given by (1)\nwith VDI and CDI. Time is in ms, voltages in mV and currents\nin nA. In the left column are results with data for activation and\nVDI of Pospischil et al. (2008), and in the right column of Rhodes\nand Llin\u00e1s (2005). The voltage is held at VCON D from t = 20 to\nt = 220 and at VT EST from t = 225 to t = 445. In the bottom\ngraphs the amplitude (minimum) of ICaL is plotted against the conditioning pulse voltage for the first pulse (blue curves) and for the\nsecond pulse (red curves). VT EST is at the minmum of the blue\ncurves which occur at -20 mV for the left set of results and -5 mV\nfor the right set. In the top graphs, responses are shown for three\nparticular values of VCON D . The red curves are for VCON D at the\nvalue of VT EST , which gives a large reduction in ICaL on the second\npulse due to CDI. The blue curves are for VCON D = 70 where the\ncurrent on the first pulse is very small. The green curves are for\nVCON D = \u221235 (left) and VCON D = \u221225 (right). The results may be\ncompared with those of Figure 1 in Budde et al. (2002).\n\n45\n\n\fThe conditioning pulse is on from 20 to 220 ms and the test\npulse is on from 225 to 445 ms. The voltage at the test pulse is\ntaken as that at which the response to the first pulse has the largest\n(negative) amplitude. Results of these calculations are shown in\nFigure 11. The curves in the bottom part of the figure show the\nmagnitudes of the currents in response to the first (blue) and second\n(red) pulses. The reduction in the amplitude of in the second pulse\nis most prominent when the response to the first pulse is the greatest, because Cai has increased the most, resulting in the greatest\namount of CDI. In the top parts of the Figure are shown responses\nto two-pulse clamps for three particular values of VCON D , as explained in the Figure caption. Although such results indicate that\nthe standard model for ICaL with the usual voltage-dependent activation, coupled with VDI and CDI may be adequate for describing\ncertain experimental paradigms, it is uncertain whether this is the\ncase in applications to single cell models, mainly due to the lack of\nconcrete data. The relative contributions of CDI and VDI depend\non the particular cell type, mainly through the various combinations of subtypes of L-channels as well as modulating factors such\nas sub-unit configurations and various ligands.\n\n4.5\n\nDifficulties in the accurate modeling of ICaL\n\nMathematical modelers of nerve cell physiology are invariably faced\nwith the dilemma of insufficient accurate data concerning the many\nion channels influencing a neuron or muscle cell's activity. It is\nhard to think of a single neuron for which such data is available\nfor all known channel types. As an example, L-type current data,\nfor a current denoted by IL , were not available for thalamic relay\nneurons when they were first comprehensively modeled (McCormick\nand Huguenard, 1992). Instead, the parameters were obtained from\nthe calcium current results of Kay and Wong (1987) for CA1 pyramidal cells, where in fact an L-type current had not been pharmacologically identified. Kay and Wong hypothesized that the channels\nthey had analyzed were from a homogeneous population. The same\nor similar data were employed by Traub et al. (1991) for ICa in\nCA1 pyramids, Hutcheon et al. (1994) for IL in thalamic relay\ncells, Traub et al. (1994) for for ICa in CA3 pyramids, Wallen46\n\n\fstein (1994) for IL in nucleus reticularis thalami neurons and Wang\n(1998) for ICa in cortical pyramidal cells. In none of these models\nwas calcium-dependent inactivation included.\nIt is hoped that in the future, experiments can be performed to\nremedy the paucity of accurate data required for L-type (and other)\ncurrent modeling. There are other limitations apart from the use of\ndata from one cell type for another. The fact that the majority of\nexperiments are performed on dissociated cells means that existing\ndata must be biased towards those for cell somas, so that guesses\nhave to be made for dendrites. To make choice of parameters even\nmore difficult is the use of various different concentrations of either\ncalcium or barium ions which may give results for such quantities as\nactivation potentials which are very different from those for physiological concentrations. Temperature is another key factor which\nmay alter the dynamic properties considerably. Furthermore, results for heterologous ion channels may not be the same as for the\ncorresponding channels in native cells.\nThus, given the many uncertainties in the parameters describing\nthe kinetics of the various ion channels, it is hard to know whether\nmodel-based predictions are truly descriptive of cell electrophysiology even when they agree with experimental observations. The hope\nis then that the modeling results are robust enough with respect to\nrelatively small changes in the parameters. To construct a model\nof a nerve cell is a very large undertaking, and fortunately many\nresearchers have had the courage to proceed with such endeavours\nin the light of uncertainties concerning the underlying channel data.\n\n5\n\nL-channel subtype properties\n\nL-type currents are not only important for neuronal and cardiac\ncell dynamics. Although L-type channels play a limited role in\nthe process of synaptic transmission, they are crucial for activitydependent gene expression and for regulating plasticity at certain\nsynapses (Hardingham et al. 2001; Dolmetsch et al., 2001; Helton\net al. 2005). Thus they have been found to play an essential role in\nlong-term alterations in synaptic efficacy underlying learning and\nmemory in the hippocampus (Kapur et al., 1998; Graef et al., 1999;\nLeitch et al., 2009) where both Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 channel subtypes\n47\n\n\fare predominantly located in postsynaptic dendritic processes and\nsomata. Furthermore, current through Cav 1.3 channels has been\ndemonstrated at the output synapses of mice AII amacrine cells\n(Habermann et al., 2003).\n\n5.1\n\nDistribution\n\nThe Cav 1.1 subtype is mainly found in skeletal muscle and Cav 1.4\nis found in the retina, but also in human T lymphocytes (Kotturi\nand Jefferies, 2005). The remaining subtypes Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3\nconstitute the main L-type channels in neurons, endocrine cells and\nheart cells. The Cav 1.2 subtype is widely expressed in heart, brain,\nsmooth muscle and endocrine systems (Ertel et al., 2000). In the\nbrain it is found in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus,\ncaudate putamen and amygdala (Splawski et al., 2004). In neuroendocrine cells, Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 channels are involved in action potential generation, bursting activity and hormone secretion\n(Lipscombe et al., 2004; Marcantoni et al., 2007). According to\nVignali et al. (2006), 60% of calcium current in both mouse pancreatic A- and B-cells is L-type, with mainly Cav 1.2 in B-cells and\nboth Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 in A-cells. The Cav 1.3 subtype is found\nin sinoatrial node, cochlear hair cells, and dendritic neuronal processes (Dolphin, 2009). Schlick et al. (2010) reported distributions\nof subtypes in many brain regions, including during development,\nand found that patterns tended to be intrinsic rather than dependent on neural activity. Using barium as charge carrier, Navedo\net al. (2007) investigated isoform contributions in mouse arterial\nsmooth muscle. Both Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3 were involved in calcium\nsparklet formation but Cav 1.2 was primarily responsible (see Table\nA6).\nImmunofluorescence studies have determined that both Cav 1.2\nand Cav 1.3 have mainly proximal locations on neurons, particularly on the dendrites, and they may make a substantial contribution to the inward current and the action potential (Holmgaard et\nal., 2008). According to Martinez-Gomez and Lopez-Garcia (2007),\nin mouse and rat spinal neurons Cav 1.2 channels tend to localize\nin soma and proximal dendrites whereas Cav 1.3 channels are also\nfound in distal dendrites. However, Zhang et al. (2006) found that\n\n48\n\n\fin the cat, Cav 1.3 channels were dense in ventral horn motoneurons,\noccurring mainly on somata and proximal dendrites and being responsible for plateau potentials in these cells. Forti and Pietrobon\n(1993) found that functionally different L-type Ca2+ channels coexist in rat cerebellar granule cells. Although Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3\nare often found in the same neuronal processes, particularly dendrites, their subcellular distributions are sometimes distinct (Hell\net al. 1993). An interesting graphical representation of the distribution of various calcium channels over the surface of hippocampal\npyramidal cells was given in Magee and Johnston (1995).\nDifferential effects of corticosterone have been found for Cav 1.2\nand Cav 1.3 in the CA1 region of hippocampus and the basolateral\namygdala (Liebmann et al., 2008). In the former, corticosterone\nincreases the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization whereas\nin the latter no such effect is observed. The different responses are\nthought to reflect the expression of Cav 1.3 in hippocampus and the\nabsence of this subtype in the basolateral amygdala.\n\n5.2\n\nRole in pacemaking\n\nIn the heart, Cav 1.3 is found in atrial tissue where it contributes\nto pacemaking but not in ventricular muscle that expresses Cav 1.2\n(Lipscombe et al. 2004). According to Torrente et al. (2011), SA\nnode pacemaker activity controls heart rate and local Ca2+ release\nis tightly controlled by Cav 1.3 channels. In Cav 1.3 KO mice, the\nfrequency of Ca2+ transients in pacemaker cells was reduced by 45%\nrelative to WT. In another study with KO mice, Zhang et al. (2011)\nfound that Cav 1.3 channels are highly expressed in atrioventricular\nnode cells and played a critical role in their firing. Mesirca et al.\n(2010) pointed out that atrioventricular node cells may contribute\nto pacemaker activity in the case of SA node failure.\nThe properties of Cav 1.3 channels which make them more suitable for pacemaking activity than Cav 1.2 channels were discussed\nin Vandael et al. (2010) with particular attention to dopaminergic neurons, cardiac pacemaker cells and adrenal chromaffin cells.\nCav 1.3 activates with steep voltage dependence at voltages considerably more negative than Cav 1.2 and has faster activation but\nslower and less complete voltage-dependent inactivation. According\n\n49\n\n\fto Striessnig (2007), such activation at low voltages enables Cav 1.3\nCa2+ currents to support pacemaking activity in sinoatrial node and\nsome neurons (for example Putzier et al., 2009a). For adrenal chromaffin cells, Marcantoni et al. (2010) found that although Cav 1.2\nand Cav 1.3 occurred with about equal frequency in WT cells, most\nof which fired at about 1.5 Hz, Cav 1.3-deficient cells had significantly less firing. The essential role of Cav 1.3 and their coupling\nto BK channels in the pacemaker activity of these cells was established. Alternative splicing of the C terminus of the \u03b11 subunit of\nCav 1.3 has been shown to give two forms, of which one (short, 42A)\nis expected to be more supportive of pacemaker activity (Singh et\nal., 2008) with 73.6% inactivation of ICa in 30 ms. See also Table\nA6.\n\n5.3\n\nBiophysical properties: activation and VDI\n\nIn Table A6 are listed some of the available data on voltage-dependent\nactivation and inactivation for examples of the four main subtypes.\nAs pointed out in the Introduction, there are no definitive results\nfor each subtype because of the modulatory effects of other subunits\nand varying experimental conditions such as the use of different\nhosts and different ionic concentrations. That is, one can expect\nconsiderable variability in channel properties for a given subtype\nfrom different preparations. As seen in the examples shown in Figure 3, Cav 1.3 channels can have quite low activation thresholds\ncompared to the Cav 1.2 subtype and which are, in the data given\nhere, similar to that of T-type. The latter have strong VDI whereas\nCav 1.3 currents are reported to have have weak VDI and strong\nCDI (Lipscombe, 2002). Very few modeling studies have distinguished subtypes, an exception being Shapiro and Lee (2007). It is\nalso apparent from the steady state inactivation function for Cav 1.2\nshown in Figure 3, based on Hu and Marban (1998), that virtually\nno Cav 1.2 channels would be available to open around resting membrane potential (about -60 mV).\nIn a pioneering study using tsA201 cells, Koschak et al. (2001)\ndetermined electrophysiological properties for Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3\n(see Table A6) with current densities of 24.5 and 24.3 pA/pF, respectively, in 15 mM Ba2+ . Generally in the cases reported Cav 1.3\n50\n\n\fhas faster kinetics than Cav 1.2 (Helton et al., 2005) which is seen in\nthe data of Table 6 and Figure 12. Inspection of Table A6 reveals\nsurprisingly that Vm, 1 is lower in the example for Cav 1.3 than for\n2\nCav 1.2, but that Vh, 1 is higher for Cav 1.3 than for Cav 1.2 . Unfor2\ntunately the incompleteness of the data for all subtypes prevents a\nquantitative comparison of their relative current amplitudes, either\nsingly or in combinations. Such a program will be useful for future\nwork when more data are available.\nTable 6: Examples of data on activation time constants for Lcurrent subtypes\nReference\n\nCav 1.1\n\nKoschak (2001)\n\nHildebrand (2004)\n++\n2mM Ba\nCatterall (2005)\n\nControl\n\n\u03bcM allethrin\n> 50 ms\n10 mV\n\n10\n\nHelton (2005)\n\nShapiro (2007)\n\nModel, MN\n\nLuin (2008)\n\nyoung\nold\n\nCav 1.2\n2.3 ms\n15mM Ba++\n1.34 ms\n1.23 ms\n1 ms\n10 mV\n2.43e\u22120.02V\nV \u2208 [\u221220, 20]\n30 ms\n\nCav 1.3\n1.2 ms\n15mM Ba++\n\nCav 1.4\n\n< 1 ms\n<1 ms\n10 mV\n1.26e\u2212.02V\nV \u2208 [\u221255, 10]\n24 ms\n\n53.6*\n62.5*\n\nThere are only limited data on activation time constants for Lchannel subtypes, some being given in Table 6.

On the other hand, Cav 1.2 and Cav 1.3\nwere shown to not be directly related to absence epileptogenesis\n(Weiergr\u00e4ber et al., 2010). Mutations of Cav 1.2 have been found to\nresult in Timothy syndrome (Splawski et al., 2004), which is a multiorgan disease manifesting in cardiac arrythmias, metabolic and immune system deficiencies and autism. It has been posited (Barrett\nand Tsien, 2008; Yarotskyy et al., 2009) that strongly decreased\nvoltage-dependent inactivation, but not CDI, associated with the\nmutant channel subtype is a possible underlying cause. Alterations\nin L-channel density and activity have been found in aged rat hippocampal neurons with the possibility of a role in cognitive decline\nand the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (Thibault and Landfield,\n1996; Thibault et al., 2001, 2007; Norris et al., 2010). The expression of amyloid precursor protein was shown to increase L-type Ca2+\ncurrents, thus leading to the inhibition of calcium oscillations (Santos et al., 2009). Further, performance of rats in a maze task was\nfound to be strikingly negatively correlated with L-channel density\n(Thibault and Landfield, 1996).\nAltered properties of L-type calcium channels have also been\nimplicated in muscular dystrophy (Collet et al., 2003) and epilepsy\n(Fuller-Bicer et al., 2009). N'Gouemo et al. (2009) found upregulation of various high threshold calcium currents including ICaL in\nrat models of epilepsy.\nThe role of Cav 1.3 in pacemaking in sino-atrial node and inner hair cells of the cochlea has been demonstrated in KO mice\nwhich exhibit significant sinus bradycardia and hearing loss (see\nLipscombe et al., 2004). Striessnig et al. (2004) reviewed the role\nof L-type calcium channels in human disease caused by genetic channel defects (channelopathies) in \u03b11 subunits. Recently it has been\n53\n\n\fdemonstrated in humans that a mutation in a gene which encodes\nthe \u03b11 -subunit of Cav 1.3 channels is associated with deafness and\nsino-atrial node dysfunction (Baig et al., 2010). The possibility\nand usefulness of subtype-specific therapeutic drugs has been discussed in Striessnig et al. (2006) and more recently in Zuccotti et al.\n(2011). A comprehensive review of L-subtype properties (and other\ncalcium currents) and associated channelopathies was compiled by\nPiedras-Renter\u0131\u0301a et al. (2007).\n\n6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nL-type Ca2+ currents have many fundamental roles, including providing basic depolarization in action potential generation, amplification of synaptic inputs (established in spinal motoneurons) and\ninvolvement in signaling pathways for activating transcription factors such as CREB and hence the expression of genes that are essential for synaptic plasticity and other important cellular processes.\nCav 1.4 L-type channels are also involved in Ca2+ -signaling in immune cells\nQuantitative descriptions of L-type Ca2+ currents thus play an\nimportant role in understanding the dynamics of many processes\nin neurons and other cells, particularly cardiac myocytes. We have\nhere reviewed the basic deterministic methods for a mathematical\ndescription of these currents. Whereas activation is usually taken\nto be voltage dependent, inactivation has varying degrees of CDI\nand VDI and each cell type requires a separate analysis of their\nrelative contributions, which requires experimental investigation in\naddition to fundamental current-voltage relations. Incorporating Ltype Ca2+ currents in a neuronal model is often hampered by lack\nof knowledge as to the location of the corresponding ion channels,\nwhich is important to ascertain their contributions to cell dynamics.\nAn additional complication is that some cells have more than 1\nsubtype of L-type channels with separate properties and locations.\nThe use of Markov chain theory, not described here, for transitions between various channel states has proven useful for cardiac\ncells but as far as can be discerned has not yet been applied to\nL-type channels in neurons. The deterministic, or averaging approach, outlined in this review has the advantage of simplicity and\n54\n\n\fis thus likely to continue to be employed in modeling L-type (and\nother) calcium currents in multi-component nerve cell models. It is\nnevertheless not capable of capturing the fine details of the gating\nschemes for the activation and inactivation processes (Peterson et\nal., 1999; Erickson et al., 2003; Tanskanen et al., 2005; Tadross and\nYue, 2010; Williams et al., 2010) which are made complicated by\nthe roles of subunits and the varying degrees of voltage-dependent\nand calcium-dependent dynamics. See also Section 4.4 for a discussion of some of the general difficulties encountered in constructing\naccurate mathematical models for neurons.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am grateful to Professor Nicholas Penington, Physiology and Pharmacology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, for useful\ncomments on the manuscript and for valuable references, and to\nProfessor Annette Dolphin, Department of Neuroscience, University\nCollege London, for permission to reprint Figure 1.

In\nthe years following the introduction of the term L-type, the term\nwas often taken to imply a high threshold current, although later\nsome L-type currents were found to be activated at quite low membrane potentials. The pharmacological distinction between the various types is desirable but has not always been possible. Except\nin the case of experiments on subtypes which are clearly identified,\nusually in transfected cells, original sources may be consulted to\ndetermine the likelihood that the ion channels under consideration\nbelong to the L-type category. Table A1.1 contains activation and\n55\n\n\finactivation data and modeling studies as opposed to experimental\ndeterminations have been marked M.
