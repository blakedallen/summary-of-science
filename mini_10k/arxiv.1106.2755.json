S. KUTATELADZE\nAbstract. This is an overview of the present-day versions of monadology with\nsome applications to vector lattices and linear inequalities. Two approaches\nto combining nonstandard set-theoretic models are sketched and illustrated by\norder convergence, principal projection, and polyhedrality.\n\nThe notion of monad is central to external set theory. Justifying the simultaneous use of infinitesimals and the technique of descending and ascending in vector\nlattice theory requires adaptation of monadology for the implementation of filters\nin Boolean valued universes. This is still a rather uncharted area of research. The\ntwo approaches are available now. One is to apply monadology to the descents\nof objects. The other consists in applying the standard monadology inside the\nBoolean valued universe V(B) over a complete Boolean algebra B, while ascending\nand descending by the Escher rules (cp. [1] and [2]).\nThese approaches are sketched and illustrated by tests for order convergence\nand rules for fragmenting and projecting positive operators in vector lattices. Also,\nLagrange's principle is shortly addressed in polyhedral environment with inexact\ndata.\nBasics of Monadology\nThe concept of monad stems from Ancient Greece. Monadology as a philosophical doctrine is a creation of Leibniz (cp. [3] and [4]). The general theory of the\nmonads of filters was proposed by Luxemburg (cp. [5]) within Robinson's nonstandard analysis (cp. [6]).\nLet F be a standard filter; \u25e6 F , the standard core of F ; and aF := F \\ \u25e6F , the\nexternal set of remote elements of F . Note that\n\\\n[\n\u25e6\na\n\u03bc(F ) :=\nF =\nF\nis the monad of F . Also, F = \u2217 fil ({\u03bc(F )}); i.e., F is the standardization of the\ncollection fil (\u03bc(F )) of all supersets of \u03bc(F ).\nLet A be a filter on X \u00d7 Y , and let B be a filter on Y \u00d7 Z. Put B \u25e6 A :=\nfil{B \u25e6 A | A \u2208 A , B \u2208 B}, where we may assume all B \u25e6 A nonempty. Then\n\u03bc(B \u25e6 A ) = \u03bc(B) \u25e6 \u03bc(A ).\nGranted Horizon Principle. Let X and Y be standard sets. Assume further\nthat F and G are standard filters on X and Y respectively satisfying \u03bc(F )\u2229\u25e6X 6= \u2205.\nKey words and phrases. Dedekind complete vector lattice, filter, fragments, principal projection, order convergence, up-down, descent, ascent, polyhedral Lagrange principle, Boolean valued\nmodel.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. S. KUTATELADZE\n\nDistinguish a remote set F in aF . Given a standard correspondence f \u2282 X \u00d7 Y\nmeeting F , the following are equivalent:\n(1) f (\u03bc(F ) \u2212 F ) \u2282 \u03bc(G );\n(2) (\u2200 F \u2032 \u2208 aF ) f (F \u2032 \u2212 F ) \u2282 \u03bc(G );\n(3) f (\u03bc(F )) \u2282 \u03bc(G ).\nFilters within V(B)\nLet B be a complete Boolean algebra. Given an ordinal \u03b1, put\n(B)\nV (B) := {x | (\u2203\u03b2 \u2208 \u03b1) x : dom(x) \u2192 B, dom(x) \u2282 V }.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nThe Boolean valued universe V\n\n(B)\n\nis\n\nV\n\n(B)\n\n:=\n\n[\n\nV\u03b1(B) ,\n\n\u03b1\u2208On\n\nwith On the class of all ordinals.\nThe truth value [[\u03c6]] \u2208 B is assigned to each formula \u03c6 of ZFC relativized to V(B) .\nLet Q be the Stone space of a complete Boolean algebra B. Denote by U the\n(separated) Boolean valued universe V(B) . Given q \u2208 Q, put u \u223cq v \u2194 q \u2208 [[u = v]].\nConsider the bundle\n\b\n\u0001\nV Q := q, \u223cq (u) | q \u2208 Q, u \u2208 U\n\u0001\nand denote q, \u223cq (u) by u\nb(q). Hence u\nb : q 7\u2192 u\nb(q) is a section of V Q for every\nu \u2208 U. Note that to each x \u2208 V Q there are u \u2208 U and q \u2208 Q satisfying u\nb(q) = x.\nMoreover, we have u\nb(q) = vb(q) if and only if q \u2208 [[u = v]].\nMake each fiber V q of V Q into an algebraic system of signature {\u2208} by letting\nq\nV |= x \u2208 y \u2194 q \u2208 [[u \u2208 v]], where u, v \u2208 U are such that u\nb(q) = x and vb(q) = y.\nThe class {b\nu(A) | u \u2208 U}, with A a clopen subset of Q, is a base for some\ntopology on V Q . Thus V Q as a continuous bundle called a continuous polyverse.\nBy a continuous section of V Q we mean a section that is a continuous function.\nDenote by C the class of all continuous sections of V Q .\nThe mapping u 7\u2192 u\nb is a bijection between U and C, yielding a convenient functional realization of the Boolean valued universe V(B) . This universal construction\nbelongs to Gutman and Losenkov (cp. [7]).\nThe functional realization visualizes descending and ascending, the Escher rules,\nand the Gordon Theorem (cp. [8]).\nLet G be a filterbase on X, with X \u2208 P(V(B) ). Put\nG \u2032 := {F \u2208 P(X\u2191)\u2193 | (\u2203G \u2208 G ) [[ F \u2283 G\u2191 ]] = 1};\nG \u2032\u2032 := {G\u2191 | G \u2208 G }.\nThen G \u2032\u2191 and G \u2032\u2032\u2191 are bases of the same filter G \u2191 on X\u2191 inside V(B) -the ascent of\nG . If fil(G ) is the set of all mixings of nonempty families of elements of G and G\nconsists of cyclic sets; then fil(G ) is a filterbase on X and G \u2191 = fil(G )\u2191 .\nIf F is a filter on X inside V(B) then put F \u2193 := fil ({F\u2193 | F \u2208 F\u2193}). The filter F \u2193\nis the descent of F . A filterbase G on X\u2193 is extensional provided that fil (G ) = F\nfor some filter F on X.\nThe descent of an ultrafilter on X is a proultrafilter on X\u2193. A filter with a base\nof cyclic sets is cyclic. Proultrafilters are maximal cyclic filters.\nFix a standard complete Boolean algebra B and think of V(B) to be composed of\ninternal sets. If A is external then the cyclic hull fil(A) of A consists of x \u2208 V(B)\n\n\fLEIBNIZIAN, ROBINSONIAN, AND BOOLEAN VALUED MONADS\n\n3\n\nadmitting an internal family (a\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e of elements of A and an internal partition\n(b\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e of unity in B such that x is the mixing of (a\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e by (b\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e ; i.e., b\u03be x = b\u03be a\u03be\nfor \u03be \u2208 \u039e or, equivalently, x = fil\u03be\u2208\u039e (b\u03be a\u03be ).\nGiven a filter F on X\u2193, let\nF\u2191\u2193 := fil ({F\u2191\u2193 | F \u2208 F }).\nThen fil(\u03bc(F )) = \u03bc(F\u2191\u2193) and F\u2191\u2193 is the greatest cyclic filter coarser than F .\nThe monad of F is called cyclic if \u03bc(F ) = fil(\u03bc(F )). Unfortunately, the cyclicity\nof a monad is not completely responsible for extensionality of a filter.\nThe cyclic monad hull \u03bcc (U ) of an external set U is defined as follows:\nx \u2208 \u03bcc (U ) \u2194 (\u2200st V = V \u2191\u2193)V \u2283 U \u2192 x \u2208 \u03bc(V ).\nIf B = 2, then \u03bcc (U ) is the monad of the standardization of the external filter of\nsupersets of U , i.e. the (discrete) monad hull \u03bcd (U ).\nThe cyclic monad hull of a set is the cyclic hull of its monad hull\n\u03bcc (U ) = fil(\u03bcd (U )).\nA special role is played by the essential points of X\u2193 constituting the external\nset e X. By definition, an essential point of e X belongs to the monad of some\nproultrafilter on X\u2193. The collection e X of all essential points of X is usually\nexternal.\nTest for Essentiality. A point x \u2208 e X if and only if x can be separated by\na standard set from every standard cyclic set not containing x.\nIf there is an essential point in the monad of an ultrafilter F then \u03bc(F ) \u2282 e X;\nmoreover, F\u2191\u2193 is a proultrafilter.\nA filter F is extensional if and only if \u03bc(F ) = \u03bcc (e \u03bcF ). A standard set A is\ncyclic if and only if A is the cyclic monad hull of e A.\nTest for the Mixing of Filters. Let (F\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e be a standard family of extensional filters, and let (b\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e be a standard partition of unity. The filter F is the\nmixing of (F\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e by (b\u03be )\u03be\u2208\u039e if and only if\n(\u2200St \u03be \u2208 \u039e)b\u03be \u03bc(F ) = b\u03be \u03bc(F\u03be ).\nProperties of Essential Points. (1) The image of an essential point under\nan extensional mapping is an essential point of the image;\n(2) Let E be a standard set, and let X be a standard element of V(B) . Consider\n\u2227\nthe product X E inside V(B) , where E \u2227 is the standard name of E in V(B) . If x\n\u2227\nis an essential point of X E \u2193 then for every standard e \u2208 E the point x\u2193(e) is\nessential in X\u2193;\n(3) Let F be a cyclic filter in X\u2193, and let e \u03bc(F ) := \u03bc(F ) \u2229 e X be the set of\nessential points of its monad. Then e \u03bc(F ) = e \u03bc(F \u2191\u2193 ).\nLet (X, U ) be a uniform space inside V(B) .The descent (X\u2193, U \u2193 ) is procompact\nor cyclically compact if (X, U ) is compact inside V(B) . A similar sense resides in\nthe notion of pro-total-boundedness and so on.\nEvery essential point of X\u2193 is nearstandard, i.e., infinitesimally close to a standard point, if and only if X\u2193 is procompact.\nExistence of many procompact but not compact spaces provides a lot of examples\nof inessential points.\n\n\f4\n\nS. S. KUTATELADZE\n\nTest for Proprecompactness. A standard space is the descent of a totally\nbounded uniform space if and only if its every essential point is prenearstandard,\ni.e. belongs to the monad of a Cauchy filter.\nLet Y to be a universally complete vector lattice. By Gordon's Theorem, Y = R\u2193\nof the reals R inside V(B) over the base B := B(Y ) of Y .\nDenote by E the filter of order units in Y , i.e. E := {\u03b5 \u2208 Y+ | [[ \u03b5 = 0 ]] = 0}.\nPut x \u2248 y \u2194 (\u2200st \u03b5 \u2208 E ) (|x\u2212y| < \u03b5). Given a, b \u2208 Y , write a < b if [[ a < b ]] = 1;\nin other words, a > b \u2194 a \u2212 b \u2208 E . Thus, there is some deviation from the\nunderstanding of the theory of ordered vector spaces. Clearly, this is done in order\nto adhere to the principles of introducing notations while descending and ascending.\nLet \u2248 Y be the nearstandard part of Y .

The descent standardization \u2217 \u03a6 of an extensional\ncorrespondence \u03a6 is also defined in a natural way.\nConsidering the descent standardizations of the standard names of elements of\nthe von Neumann universe V, use the abbreviations \u2217 x := \u2217 (x\u2227 ) and \u2217 x := (\u2217 x)\u2193\nfor x \u2208 V.

On the other hand, T\u2191\u2193 = T .\nFor every T \u2208 L\u223c (E, F ) the ascent T\u2191 is a regular R\u2227 -functional on E \u2227 inside V(B) ; i.e., [[ T\u2191 \u2208 E \u2227\u223c ]] = 1. The mapping T 7\u2192 T\u2191 is a linear and lattice\nisomorphism between L\u223c (E, F ) and E \u2227\u223c\u2193.\nAn operator S \u2208 L\u223c (E, F ) is a fragment or component of 0 \u2264 T \u2208 L\u223c (E, F )\nif S \u2227 (T \u2212 S) = 0.

The implications (1) \u2192 (2) \u2192 (3) are obvious.\n(3) \u2192 (4): We will work within the standard entourage; i.e., we presume that\nall free variables are standard. Note first that validity of the sought equality for\nall functionals g and f satisfying 0 \u2264 g \u2264 f amounts to existence of p \u2208 P, given\na standard x \u2265 0, such that p\u22a5 g(x) \u2248 0 and p(f \u2212 g)(x) \u2248 0. (As usual, p\u22a5 is the\ncomplementary band projection to p.) Thus, \u25e6 p(g \u2227 (f \u2212 g))(x) \u2264 \u25e6 p(f \u2212 g)(x) = 0\nand \u25e6 p\u22a5 ((f \u2212 g) \u2227 g)(x) \u2264 \u25e6 p\u22a5 g(x) = 0, i.e. g \u2227 (f \u2212 g) = 0.\nProve now that, on assuming (3), the sought equality ensues from the conventional criterion for disjointness:\ninf{g(x1 ) + (f \u2212 g)(x2 ) | x1 \u2265 0, x2 \u2265 0, x1 + x2 = x} = 0.\nGiven a standard x, find internal positive x1 and x2 such that x = x1 + x2 and,\nmoreover, g(x1 ) \u2248 0 and f (x2 ) \u2248 g(x2 ). By (3), it follows from the Kre\u0131\u0306n\u2013Milman\nTheorem that the fragment g belongs to the weak closure of P(f ).
