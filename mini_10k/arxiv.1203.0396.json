Introduction\nStatic one-dimensional (1D) modeling of the solar atmosphere\nassumes hydrostatic equilibrium in plane-parallel-layer geometry to deliver temperature and density stratifications along vertical columns that may serve as reference description to compute spectral continua and lines similar to actual solar radiation. Early versions of such \"standard\" models were compiled by de Jager (1959) and Heintze et al. (1964a, 1964b).\nHolweger's (1967) LTE best-fit to optical iron lines became\nthe first choice in classical abundance determination, in particular as the HOLMUL update by Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974).\nThis model describes only the photosphere and is close to theoretical photosphere models based on the additional assumption of energy conservation in the form of radiative equilibrium plus mixing-length convection in the deepest layers\n(e.g., Kurucz 1974, 1994; Gustafsson et al. 1975, 2008). Semiempirical best-fit modeling of solar continua including ultraviolet wavelengths sampling the chromosphere continued\nwith the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (Gingerich & de\nJager 1968), the Harvard-Smithsonian Reference Atmosphere\n(Gingerich et al. 1971), the VAL model grids of Vernazza et al.\n(1973, 1976, 1981) fitting disk-center Lyman brightness bins,\nthe update by Maltby et al. (1986), the more recent update concentrating on disk-center ultraviolet spectra by Avrett & Loeser\n(2008), and the sequence of similar refinements by Fontenla\net al. (1990, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2009).\nThis paper is triggered by the conclusion of Fontenla et al.\n(2009) that \"in the solar chromosphere, the FUV and EUV obSend offprint requests to: R.J.

(AURA), for the National Science Foundation\n\nserved emissions in continuum and lines produced in the upper\nchromosphere and transition region irradiate the low chromosphere and have significant effects on the ionization.\". In particular, they claim that such backradiation strongly affects the density of minority stages of ionization in and near the temperature\nminimum of their quiet-Sun model. We first show that this claim\nis incompatible with basic observations, and then use illustrative\ncomputations to demonstrate that, instead, photospheric irradiation from below is the dominant agent in ultraviolet continuum\nformation in the quiet-Sun model of Fontenla et al. (2009), as\nwas the case for the older standard models.\nWe continue by demonstrating that significant chromospheric backradiation occurs in H\u03b1 in such static models through\ntwo-level scattering (Sect. 6), but argue that the assumption of\ncolumnar hydrostatic equilibrium is untenable for the chromosphere and transition region (Sect. 7).\n\n2. Observation\nIn this section we briefly review the observational character of\nthe chromosphere, as counterpart to the standard-model definition as the domain between the model's temperature minimum\nand steep temperature rise towards the corona. Figure 1 gives an\noverview of the appearance of the solar atmosphere in an area\ncontaining plage and network. We use it to demonstrate that the\nactual chromosphere may have enough opacity to supply significant backradiation in H\u03b1, but not in the 1700 \u00c5 continuum.\nThe G-band image and the magnetogram in the first column\nof Fig. 1 are photospheric. The first image displays the granulation and the spatial distribution of small kilogauss magnetic\nconcentrations qualitatively and without sign through their proxy\nas intergranular bright points (best seen when zooming in). The\nsecond image quantifies the actual surface distribution of the\nline-of-sight component in such strong-field concentrations, but\nat lower angular resolution. The correspondence is excellent.\n1\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nFig. 1.

The field of view (scales in arcsec, terrestrial North up) is near disk center, South of the largest sunspot of AR11109.\nIt contains a ridge of plage in its upper half, quieter areas in its lower half. The greyscales have been optimized by clipping (all images) and\nlogarithmic scaling (AIA images).

S\u00fctterlin.\nThe other four images allegedly sample the chromosphere\n(1700 \u00c5, Ca ii H, H\u03b1) and the transition region (He II 304 \u00c5).\nHowever, only the H\u03b1 image truly shows the chromosphere. It\nconsists of long slender fibrils that cover and obscure the photosphere everywhere in the form of overlying fibrilar canopies.\nThis is always the case near active regions, plage, and active\nnetwork; only the very quietest internetwork areas are not covered by fibrils in H\u03b1 (e.g., Plate 3.1 of Bray & Loughhead 1974;\nRouppe van der Voort et al. 2007; Rutten et al. 2008). These\nubiquitous H\u03b1 fibril canopies constitute the ring of pink emission just off the limb around the Sun that Lockyer (1868) named\n\"chromosphere\". They are also likely to irradiate the low-opacity\ndomain underneath with H\u03b1 backradiation. Their geometry remains unknown; the fibrilar appearance in images as this one\nmay represent long slender cylindrical fluxtubes (e.g., Heinzel\n& Schmieder 1994), density variations that cause corrugations of\nthe \u03c4 = 1 Eddington-Barbier surface in an extended atmosphere\n(Schoolman 1972), or warps in sheets as proposed by Judge et al.\n(2011).\nThe 1700 \u00c5 continuum shows no fibril canopies covering internetwork areas but the underlying domain of cool gas that is\nevery few minutes ridden through by successive hot shocks producing Ca ii H2V and K2V cell grains (Rutten & Uitenbroek 1991;\nCarlsson & Stein 1997; cf. Rutten 2011). It is called \"clapotisphere\" here following Rutten (1995) and is badly represented\nby the hydrostatic standard models (Carlsson & Stein 1995). The\nbright points marking magnetic concentrations and making up\nthe network and plage are roughly co-spatial with the deeper Gband bright points. Their large brightness contrast represents a\nmixture of scattered hot-wall radiation from below and current\nheating (Carlsson et al. 2010). Numerical simulations suggest\n2\n\nthat, due to the latter heating, magnetic concentrations do contain temperature stratifications resembling the standard models\n(e.g., the FAL-C model of Fontenla et al. 1993), but with the temperature minimum shifted down to height h \u2248 150 km, still within\nthe photosphere, due to fluxtube evacuation (first quartet in Fig. 9\nof Leenaarts et al. 2010). Ubiquitous shocks occur also in and\nnear these concentrations, but also already deeper than in the\nshocked internetwork clapotisphere (Steiner et al. 1998; Rutten\net al. 2011). Slow hydrogen ionization/recombination balancing\nin the cool aftermath of the shocks causes large NLTE overpopulation of the lower level of H\u03b1 (Leenaarts et al. 2007).\nThe Ca ii H image is much like the 1700 \u00c5 image, apart from\ndifference in angular resolution. In the internetwork it shows a\nbright mesh pattern that is dominated by shock interference and\nchanges rapidly. There are no chromospheric fibrils. One should\nrather expect that fibrils that are opaque in H\u03b1 are also opaque\nat the center of Ca ii H, because the thicker parts of H\u03b1 fibrils\nare seen also in Ca II 8542 \u00c5 (Cauzzi et al. 2009), and Ca ii H is\nbound to exceed Ca II 8542 \u00c5 in extinction. Indeed, in the VAL3C model Ca ii K3 forms higher than the core of H\u03b1 (Fig. 1 of\nVernazza et al. 1981). However, filtergrams such as this one are\nmade with wide passbands (1.4 \u00c5 for the DOT) so that the internetwork scene is dominated by shock brightness in the inner\nline wings that swamps the signature of very dark fibrils at line\ncenter (Reardon et al. 2009). Compared to the 1700 \u00c5 image,\nthere is an extra contribution in the form of a diffuse bright haze\naround network and plage that is likely the unresolved appearance of the highly dynamic features seen as Ca ii H straws near\nthe limb (Rutten 2006), Ca ii H spicules-II outside the limb (De\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nPontieu et al. 2007b), and RBEs (rapid blue excursions) on the\ndisk in the blue wing of H\u03b1 (Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2009).\nThe He II 304 \u00c5 image shows fibrilar patterns that are not\nidentical to but also not unlike the H\u03b1 canopies. It also shows\nsimilar bright grains near fibril feet as H\u03b1 does. These are not\ncospatial with the bright grains in the G-band and Ca ii H images. The overall similarity suggests that hot transition-region\ngas shares the field-guided topography of the H\u03b1 chromosphere,\noutlining similar magnetic connectivity patterns. Such patterns\nseem also to be mapped by Ly\u03b1 fibrils in VAULT images\n(Vourlidas et al. 2010). Any fibril that is opaque in H\u03b1 must be\nvery thick in Ly\u03b1 but, comparably to Ca ii H, the cell-covering\nfibrils are very dark in Ly\u03b1 whereas other structures, likely\nDoppler-shifted out of line-center obscuration, contribute larger\nbrightness in the profile-summed VAULT images (Koza et al.\n2009).\nThe conclusion from this section is that significant chromospheric backradiation may be expected in H\u03b1 and in He II 304 \u00c5\nwhich show opaque fibrilar canopies that constitute the actual\nchromosphere. Ca ii H should show them too at line center, but\nthe DOT image and all other H & K filtergrams have too wide a\nbandpass. In the 1700 \u00c5 image the absence of any fibrilar signature, bright or dark or as erasure of the internetwork pattern seen\nin Ca ii H, implies that they are transparent at this wavelength,\neven for such a not-so-quiet area. Since the backradiation by an\noptically thin fibril scales with the fibril opacity, it is unlikely\nthat deeper layers are affected by chromospheric backradiation\nin such ultraviolet continua.\n\n3. Formulation\nFontenla et al. (2009) based their claim of important chromospheric backradiation on their Fig. 4 containing graphs of population departure coefficients b for selected levels of Si i, Si ii,\nMg i, MgII, Fe i, and Fe ii. Population departure coefficients measure the ratio of the actual population density (particles cm\u22123 ) to\nthe population computed assuming LTE. There are two formats\ndiffering in normalization. The first, called \"Menzel\" here, follows the original use by Menzel & Cilli\u00e9 (1937) who normalized\nhydrogen populations to the free proton density. The generalization is to use a partial Saha-Boltzmann evaluation to obtain\nnormalization to the next ion stage (Eq. (6.3) of Jefferies 1968;\nEqs. (13)\u2013(15) of Vernazza et al. 1981). The other format, called\n\"Zwaan\" here, follows Wijbenga & Zwaan (1972) and uses the\nelemental abundance as normalization. The two conventions are\n(Rutten 2003):\n\u2261 ni /nLTE\nbZwaan\ni\ni\n\nand\n\n\u2261\nbMenzel\ni\n\nni /nLTE\ni\nnC /nCLTE\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ni is the population of level i, nC is the total population of\nthe next ion, and the superscript LTE implies a complete solution\nof the Boltzmann-Saha LTE partitioning equations for the given\nlevel and all stages of the element. Sometimes the ion ground\nstate nc is used instead of nC assuming nc \u2248 nC . When the atom\nor ion containing level i is predominantly ionized, so that nC \u2248\nnCLTE because most particles of the species are in the next-ion\nstage, then\n,\n\u2248 bZwaan\n\u2248 ni /nLTE\nbMenzel\ni\ni\ni\n\n(2)\n\nbut when most of the element sits in level i itself then\n\u2248 nCLTE /nC \u2248 1/bCZwaan.\nbMenzel\ni\n\n(3)\n\nFig. 2.

Dotted: radiative-equilibrium model from Kurucz (1979, 1992a,\n1992b), extended to larger height assuming constant temperature.\n\nThe continuum has bCMenzel \u2261 1 and the ratio bi /bC \u2248 bi /bc is the\nsame in both definitions.\nEquations (2) and (3) were given as Eqs. (17) and (18)\nby Vernazza et al. (1981), who used the Menzel definition.\nFontenla et al. (2009) did so too (private communication from\nJ. Fontenla). We show results for both definitions here because\nthe Zwaan version gives a more intuitive display of actual population departures for majority stages. For example, the Menzelcoefficient dips for n = 1 of H i and C i at the temperature minimum in Figs. 30 and 33 of Vernazza et al. (1981) and Figs. 13\nand 14 of Fontenla et al. (2007) do not imply that the populations\nof these levels are out of LTE.\n\n4. Demonstration\nWe select magnesium for plotting departure coefficients as in\nFig. 4 of Fontenla et al. (2009). Magnesium is an important\nelectron donor in the upper photosphere where Mg i has larger\nRydberg populations than any other element (Fig. 15 of Carlsson\net al. 1992). It has important bound-free edges, at 1621.5 \u00c5 (vacuum) from the ground state (3s2 1 Se ) and especially at 2512.4 \u00c5\n(air) from the first excited level (3s3p 3 P). Mg i and Mg ii spectrum formation are characteristic for other abundant metals with\nlow ionization energy (silicon, iron, aluminum). Together, these\n\u2212\nsupply the electrons for the photospheric H opacity in the visible and infrared and they dominate the solar continuous opacity from the near-ultraviolet to Ly\u03b1 (Fig. 36 of Vernazza et al.\n1981).\nFigure 2 displays a selection of standard models. FAL-C of\nFontenla et al. (1993) was an update of VAL3-C of Vernazza\net al. (1981) with a less steep upper photosphere from the inclusion of the ultraviolet line haze and a different transition region\nfrom the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion. A more recent update\nis the AL-C7 model of Avrett & Loeser (2008), constructed in\nparticular to reproduce the ultraviolet spectrum atlases of Brekke\n(1993) and Curdt et al. (2001). These spectra are also reproduced by model FCHHT-B of Fontenla et al. (2009), which has\na higher-located temperature minimum to accommodate dark infrared CO lines.\nThe dotted curve in Fig. 2 is a radiative-equilibrium model\nfrom Kurucz (1979, 1992a, 1992b), that we extended in Cauzzi\net al. (2009) to larger height assuming constant temperature. It is\nvery similar to the FCHHT-B model up to h = 800 km, but has no\n3\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nFig. 3.

RH uses a multi-level accelerated\nlambda iteration method following Rybicki & Hummer (1991,\n1992) \u2013 hence the code's name. We used the 66-level model atom\nfor Mg i of Carlsson et al. (1992) and a 12-level model atom\nfor Mg ii from Uitenbroek (1997). Mg iii is represented by its\nground state only. Other elements of which the more important\ntransitions are explicitly evaluated in NLTE are H, Si, Al, and\nFe. Partial redistribution is accounted for in Mg ii h & k and Ly\u03b1\nand \u03b2. The violet and ultraviolet line haze (e.g., Greve & Zwaan\n1980) causing a quasi-continuum is accounted for by sampling\nthe 236 000 lines between \u03bb = 1000 and 4000 \u00c5 in the extensive\nlist of Kurucz1 every 20 m\u00c5, using a two-level coherent scattering approximation per wavelength in which the collisional transition probability of each sampled line is estimated from the radiative one with the approximation of van Regemorter (1962),\nrather than applying a common scattering recipe for all lines as\ndone by Avrett & Loeser (2008). However, a test with the much\nsimpler line-haze recipe of Bruls et al. (1992) showed only little\ndifferences with the results shown here.\nFigure 3 shows the resulting NLTE and LTE ionization fractions for the Kurucz and FCHHT-B models. In both magnesium\nis virtually once-ionized throughout the atmosphere (below the\ntransition region at h = 1900 km for FCHHT-B). Let us first interpret the simple LTE curves in the upper Kurucz panel, which\nreflect the competing effects in the Saha equation of the outward decreases of the temperature T and electron density Ne\nshown in the lower Kurucz panel. Both decreases are steepest\nin the deepest layers, where Ne drops from 10\u22121 to 10\u22124 of the\nhydrogen density NH because hydrogen becomes neutral. The\nNe /NH \u2248 10\u22124 limit represents the combined abundance of the\n1\n\n4\n\nhttp://kurucz.harvard.edu/linelists.html\n\nFig. 4.

The steep T drop wins from the steep Ne drop so that\nthe Mg i fraction increases and the Mg iii fraction decreases with\nheight. Around h = 500 km the Ne drop wins from the T drop so\nthat the LTE Mg i fraction drops slightly. The outer exponential\ndecay of this fraction follows the decreasing gas density (with\nconstant Ne /NH \u2248 10\u22124 ) at constant temperature. The NLTE Mg i\ncurve also shows near-exponential decay around h = 500 km, implying that the nonthermal contribution, from radiative instead of\ncollisional ionization and recombination, is about constant with\nheight.\nThe Mg i and Mg iii curves in the FCHHT-B panel are closely\nthe same as in the Kurucz panel up to the FCHHT-B temperature\nminimum at h = 800 km, just as the models are. Thus, up to this\nheight magnesium ionization does not depend much on higher\nlayers.\nFigure 4 shows the population departures b of the magnesium ground states for the Kurucz and FCHHT-B models. Both\nb definitions are used (left and right columns). Mg iii cannot be\nshown in the Menzel version because we do not include Mg iv.\nSince most of the population per ionization stage resides in the\nground state, these curves reflect the divergences between the\nLTE and NLTE ionization fractions in Fig. 3.\nThe FCHHT-B/Menzel curves in the last panel resemble the\ncorresponding curves in Fig. 4 of Fontenla et al. (2009), which\nfor Si ii and Fe ii dip yet deeper than for Mg ii. At first sight the\ntwo deep dips in this panel would suggest large depletion of both\nMg i and Mg ii at the temperature minimum. However, for Mg ii\nthis dip is the reverse of the Mg iii peak in the Zwaan panel following Eq. (3). In the Zwaan panels the Mg ii curves remain near\nunity because even large overionization of Mg i and overpopulation of Mg iii do not much affect the Mg ii population, being\ndominant anyhow (Fig. 3).\nNear and above the temperature minimum, the Mg i and\nMg iii curves in the first panel of Fig. 4 mimic the temperature\nstructure of the model atmosphere, for Mg iii reversely.

Each curve is scaled to its maximum value.\n\nplies that the actual degree of ionization does not sense the temperature but is constant with height, so that the departure behavior is set by the LTE Saha-Boltzmann temperature sensitivity.\nA constant degree of ionization suggests dominance of constant\nradiation in an optically thin environment.\n\n5. Explanation\nThe behavior of bZwaan\nfor Mg i in Fig. 4 is well-understood, in\n1\nparticular since the classic PhD analysis of the comparable iron\nspectrum by Lites (1972) (cf. Athay & Lites 1972; review by\nRutten 1988). The deep dip results from the dominance of the\nradiation field J in the source function S of the Mg i ionization\nedges in the violet and ultraviolet, where the bar denotes opacityweighted frequency averaging over the edge and J is the angleaveraged intensity over all directions.\nFigure 5 illustrates this cause by plotting 100 \u00c5-wide averages of S \u03bd , B\u03bd and J\u03bd for the two major Mg i edges against height\nin the Kurucz and FCHHT-B models. The spectral averaging\nsmooths the many superimposed line blends. These quantities\nare plotted as formal temperatures in order to combine them in\nsingle diagrams for the two wavelengths, removing the Planck\nfunction sensitivity to wavelength (which is exponential in the\nWien approximation valid here). Figure 5 shows that across the\nultraviolet S \u03bd tends to follow J\u03bd at the heights where the radiation escapes (shown by the contribution functions at the bottom\nof the graphs), with J\u03bd \u2248 B\u03bd for the 2512 \u00c5 edge.\nSingle-transition scattering with S = (1\u2212\u03b5) J+\u03b5 B is an excellent approximation for these edges which scatter strongly, with\ncomplete redistribution over the edge profile. The steep decrease\nof the collisional destruction probability \u03b5 with height makes S\nuncouple from B already deep in the photosphere, at a thermalization depth much deeper than the radiation escape depth. The\n\nsensitivity of the \u039b operator to the steepness of the S \u03bd (\u03c4) gradient results in J\u03bd > B\u03bd where they uncouple. This excess produces\na superthermal edge source function in the upper photosphere,\nwith S \u2248 (bc /bi ) B in the Wien limit for an edge between level\ni and ionization limit c. Thus, the divergence between S \u03bd and\nB\u03bd for the edge at 1621.5 \u00c5 in Fig. 5 translates into the divergences between bc (Mg ii) and b1 (Mg i) in Fig. 4 that measure\nthe source function departure from LTE for this edge. Similarly\nfor bc /b2 in the edge at 2512.4 \u00c5 (which is a more important\nionization channel and continuum provider).\nIn a plane-parallel atmosphere J\u03bd flattens out to a constant\nouter limit unless there is significant emissivity in higher layers.\nThe 1D models have that in their transition regions where the\nsteeply increasing temperature gives larger \u03b5, causing renewed\ncoupling to B\u03bd . Below the transition region, the flat J\u03bd may cut\nthrough whatever the model specifies as chromospheric temperatures, so that the latter are mapped into the bc /bi ratio when S \u03bd\nfollows J\u03bd . In the FCHHT-B panel of Fig. 5 the 2512.4 \u00c5 edge\nshows such behavior. The 1621.5 \u00c5 edge has some S \u03bd coupling\nto the higher chromospheric temperature and a yet smaller increase in J\u03bd , which rises slightly above the flattened-out limit\nvalue for the Kurucz model.\nAll this is beautifully illustrated across the VAL3-C spectrum\nin Fig. 36 of Vernazza et al. (1981) and is explained at length in\nRutten (2003).\nThere is no significant difference between the two models\nin Fig, 5 at the heights of formation of these bound-free Mg i\ncontinuum contributions. For both edges the formation is purely\nphotospheric. Backradiation from the upper chromosphere plays\nno role.\nThe conclusion from Figs. 2\u20135 is that the FCHHT-B model\ndiffers quantitatively from VAL3-C, but not qualitatively and not\nin its radiation physics. In particular, the continuum formation at\nthese ultraviolet wavelengths is identical between the two models used here since the differences in S \u03bd at larger heights are not\nsampled by the photospheric contribution functions.\nFigure 6 adds FCHHT-B b curves for selected excited levels\nin Mg i and Mg ii to the ground-state display in the upper panels\nof Fig. 4. The Mg i ground state has the largest NLTE deficit in\nthe temperature minimum due to J > B overionization in the\nprincipal Mg i edges. The plateau of b1 (index 0) excess at larger\nheight maps J < B in these scattering edges.\nThe higher levels in Mg i converge to the b \u2248 1 value of the\nMg ii ground state, with multi-level crosstalk (\"interlocking\").\nIn the Mg i Rydberg domain this convergence is maintained by\na collisional population replenishment flow driven by photon\nlosses in intermediate Mg i lines, exemplified by the deep onset\nof the drop in the n = 10 curve. Such photon-loss replenishment\nfrom the next-ion population reservoir was called photon suction\nby Bruls et al. (1992). The Rydberg flow causes the Mg i emission features near \u03bb = 12 \u03bcm that were thought chromospheric\nby Zirin & Popp (1989), but actually are photospheric (Carlsson\net al. 1992).\nThe Mg ii b peaks in the second panel of Fig. 6 reflect the\neffect of J > B pumping in strong ultraviolet lines, similarly as\nin Fe ii (see Rutten 1988). A particular example of the latter is\nthe weak Fe ii 3969.4 \u00c5 line between Ca ii H and H\u01eb, discovered\nas limb emission line by Evershed (1929). Its on-disk emission\nwas initially attributed to chromospheric backradiation by Lites\n(1974), but is actually caused by photospheric pumping in Fe ii\nresonance lines (Cram et al. 1980) which explains its extraordinary spatial intensity variation at the limb (Rutten & Stencel\n5\n\n\fR.J.

Similar upper-photosphere J > B pumping sets the b peak\nof the Mg iii ground state in the first panel of Fig. 4.\nThe lower panels of Figure 6 repeat the b displays for the\nMenzel definition. The lefthand panels are the same, but on the\nright the Menzel panel shows reversals of the Zwaan panel due\nto the normalization by the Mg iii population. It makes the Mg ii\ncurves appear similar to the Mg i curves.\nThe lower panels of Figure 6 are similar to the corresponding Mg i and Mg ii panels in Fig. 4 of Fontenla et al. (2009). The\nlook-alike sequences of dips, deepest for the lowest levels, in\ntheir six Menzel plots made Fontenla et al. (2009) conclude: \"All\nour results display overionization (i.e., ground-level departure\nfrom LTE coefficients smaller than unity) of all species around\nthe temperature minimum. [. . . ] Also, near the temperature minimum the lower levels have smaller departure coefficients than\nthe upper levels, indicating that the overionization of neutrals\nis a result from FUV and/or EUV irradiation which primarily\naffects lower levels. This indicates that overionization is much\nmore affected by the irradiation from the upper chromosphere\nin continuum and emission lines than by the photospheric radiation and absorption lines. Therefore, we stress that the consideration of a realistic upper chromosphere is essential to the\ndetermination of the densities near the temperature minimum of\n(1) neutral low first-ionization-potential (FIP) elements, and (2)\nsingly ionized high FIP elements. Even a very sophisticated calculation of the effects of lower chromospheric absorption lines\non the elemental ionization can produce unrealistic results if it\ndoes not include upper chromosphere irradiation.\". This interpretation is incorrect. Downward irradiation does not affect the\ndegree of ionization of these minority species around the temperature minimum of the FCHHT-B model. We have demonstrated\nthis for Mg here; the same applies to Fe, Si, Al.\nHowever, more positively, we wish to note that the modeling of Fontenla et al. (2009) is not impaired by this misinterpretation of its results, and that that does not detract value from\ntheir effort. In this era of giant computer programs it becomes\n6\n\nnon-trivial to diagnose what the output implies. Chromospheric\nphysics is becoming a key area in solar research but does require\nunderstanding of complex non-equilibrium optically-thick spectrum formation. Our tutorial elucidation of this particular issue\nmay be instructive to newcomers to the field.\n\n6. Backradiation in H\u03b1\nFigure 7 shows formation parameters for H\u03b1 in the Kurucz and\nFCHHT-B models. It is similar to Fig. 8 in Cauzzi et al. (2009),\nbut here, prompted by the referee and in the vein of this paper,\nwe add detailed analysis using the FCHHT-B model for demonstration. We do not regard it a viable explanation of actual solar\nH\u03b1 formation (Sect. 7), but use it rather as a one-dimensional\ndidactic \"FCHHT-B star\".\nThe lefthand panel of Fig. 7 illustrates H\u03b1 line formation\nin such a star without overlying chromosphere. At line center,\nJ\u03bd drops well below B\u03bd . This behavior differs from the J\u03bd > B\u03bd\nexcesses of the ultraviolet continua in Fig. 5 because the Planckfunction sensitivity to temperature is smaller at longer wavelengths, flattening the dB\u03bd/dh gradient, and because the substantial additional line opacity \u03b1l\u03bd flattens the dB\u03bd/d\u03c4\u03bd = dB\u03bd/[(\u03b1c\u03bd +\n\u03b1l\u03bd ) dz] gradient yet more. The\u221a\u039b operator then produces J\u03bd < S \u03bd\ntending towards the S \u03bd (0) = \u03b5\u03bd B\u03bd surface value for a scattering\nisothermal atmosphere with constant \u03b5\u03bd .\nIn the Kurucz model the H\u03b1 core originates from the upper\nphotosphere around h = 400 km as a deep, strongly scattering\nline with S \u03bd \u2248 J \u03bd0 . The corresponding emergent profile is shown\nin the top panel of Fig. 8. It is well reproduced by applying the\nEddington-Barbier approximation I\u03bd \u2248 S \u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd = 1).\nThe righthand panel of Fig. 7 shows the formation of H\u03b1\nin the FCHHT-B model. Its chromospheric high-temperature\nplateau supplies sufficient H\u03b1 opacity that at line center \u03c4\u03bd = 1 is\nreached about a thousand km higher than in the Kurucz model.\nThe line-center formation is again well described by I\u03bd \u2248 S \u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd =\n1) \u2248 J\u03bd0 (\u03c4\u03bd = 1), but the Eddington-Barbier approximation is less\nwell applicable in the line wings which have a formation gap\nbetween photosphere and chromosphere (e.g., Schoolman 1972;\nLeenaarts et al. 2006). This gap is detailed in Fig. 9 which shows\nH\u03b1 opacities and optical depth scales, with the opacities multiplied by the scale height in the upper FCHHT-B photosphere (it\ndoubles in the FCHHT-B chromosphere from a steep increase of\nthe imposed non-gravitational acceleration). The line extinction\nhas a deep dip in the temperature minimum. Correspondingly,\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nFig. 9.

The tick marks\non the latter correspond to \u03c4\u03bd = 3, 1, 0.3. Across the opacity dip due to\nthe temperature minimum the optical depth is \u03c4\u03bd = 3.5, 0.7, 0.04 at the\nthree line wavelengths, respectively.\n\nFig. 8.

Lower panels: mean intensity J\u03bd across H\u03b1 at different heights in the Kurucz and FCHHT-B\natmospheres, respectively. For the Kurucz panel the sampling heights\nare 26, 41, 157, 283, 358 and 995 km. For the FCHHT-B panel they are\n35, 150, 300, 519, 850, 1000, 1340 and 1701 km. The dotted profile in\nthe bottom panel is the outward intensity at height 850 km, impinging\non the FCHHT-B chromosphere. The dotted profile in the middle panel\nis the outward intensity at height 252 km in the Kurucz model where\nthe line-center optical depth equals the optical thickness \u03c4\u03bd = 3.5 of the\nFCHHT-B chromosphere.\n\nthe optical depth buildup (dotted curves) levels out. At line center the FCHHT-B chromosphere has optical thickness \u03c4\u03bd = 3.5.\nAt \u2206\u03bb = \u22120.44 \u00c5 \u03c4\u03bd = 0.3 (outer tick) is reached already in the\nchromosphere but \u03c4\u03bd = 1 only a thousand km deeper in the photosphere. At \u2206\u03bb = \u22120.74 \u00c5 the FCHHT-B chromosphere is virtually transparent.\nAt line center the line extinction much exceeds the continuous extinction even in the dip, so that the total source function\nequals the line source function at all heights. In the wings the\nline extinction drops below the continuum extinction. Where this\nhappens the total source function drops to the Planck function\n(not shown).\nFigure 10 shows the departure coefficients b2 and b3 (Zwaan\ndefinition) governing H\u03b1 in the FCHHT-B model. The curve divergence log(b3 ) \u2212 log(b2 ) corresponds to the curve divergence\nlog(S \u03bd ) \u2212 log(B\u03bd ) in the FCHHT-B panel of Fig. 7. Throughout\n\nFig. 10.

Dashed: upper-level departure coefficient b3 .\n\nthe near-isothermal FCHHT-B chromosphere the H\u03b1 opacity is\nnearly in LTE because the formation of Ly\u03b1 is close to detailed\nbalancing there. However, this is not the case in the deep temperature minimum and steep rise to the chromospheric temperature. Here the \u039b operator smooths the rapid temperature changes\nfor the scattering-dominated Ly\u03b1 source function (not shown)\nwhich has S \u03bd \u2248 J\u03bd \u2248 b2 B\u03bd . This Ly\u03b1 smoothing causes the high\npeak in b2 and considerable corresponding fill-in of the opacity\ndips in Fig. 9, illustrated for line center as difference with the\nmuch deeper dot-dashed LTE curve. In this manner Ly\u03b1 scattering compensates for low-temperature H\u03b1 opacity loss when\ncool features are narrow in spatial extent. The b2 peak in Fig. 10\ndoubles if CRD is adopted for Ly\u03b1, from additional smoothing\nthrough farther wing-photon travel.\nThe corresponding emergent intensity profile in the top panel\nof Fig. 8 is similar to the Kurucz result despite the disparate line\nformation. Both are reasonably good approximations to the observed mean quiet-Sun profile. Both gain fit quality in the wings\nif the computed continuum intensity is rescaled to the observed\nvalue. Increase of the microturbulence in the Kurucz model from\n1.5 to about 10 km s\u22121 produces a good core fit for this model as\nwell.\n7\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nThe J\u03bd curves in Fig. 7 show that the opacity gap in the\nFCHHT-B model contains much more H\u03b1 radiation than at corresponding heights in the Kurucz model. This H\u03b1 radiation fillin causes a yet higher peak for b3 in Fig. 10. It is detailed in\nthe lower panels of Fig. 8. In the lower photosphere the H\u03b1 J\u03bd\nprofiles are the same for the two models, but above h \u2248 250 km\nthe Kurucz model gives absorption cores whereas the FCHHTB model predicts slightly self-reversed cores across the opacity gap. This difference explains that for the Kurucz model J \u03bd0\n(shown by the line-center S \u03bd curve in the lefthand panel of\nFig. 7) ends up higher than J\u03bd at line center, whereas for the\nFCHHT-B model S \u03bd \u2248 J \u03bd0 coincides with line-center J\u03bd across\nthe opacity gap in the righthand panel of Fig. 7. The large\ncore width of the highest-formed FCHHT-B profiles comes from\nlarge thermal broadening (about 10 km s\u22121 ) and yet larger microturbulence (about 15 km s\u22121 ).\nBecause the FCHHT-B chromosphere is near-isothermal the\nH\u03b1 formation is comparable to the classic results for a finite\nisothermal scattering atmosphere of Avrett & Hummer (1965),\nin particular their optically thick but effectively thin case in\nwhich the line source function does not reach thermalization.\nThe main difference is that the FCHHT-B chromosphere is irradiated from below. The impinging intensity profile in the outward direction is shown by the dotted curve in the bottom panel\nof Fig. 8. This line is much shallower than the emergent profile from the Kurucz model, in agreement with the much higher\nJ\u03bd above h \u2248 200 km. A test with a hotter chromosphere, i.e.,\nthicker in H\u03b1, gives more backradiation and a higher impinging profile with a bright self-reversed core. However, the deep\nemergent-intensity core remains about the same.\nThus, the presence of an opaque chromosphere changes the\nillumination profile with respect to the profile that emerges from\nthe same photosphere without overlying chromosphere. A mathematical explanation is given by the principle of invariance (page\n165 of Chandrasekhar 1950) regarding addition or subtraction\nof a layer of arbitrary optical thickness to a semi-infinite planeparallel atmosphere; creating a gap or pushing down the finite\nchromospheric atmosphere over the gap to where it meets similar source conditions does not change the emergent radiation. A\nmore physical explanation is that the radiation field in the gap\nbuilds up due to backradiation from the overlying chromosphere\n(called reflection by Chandrasekhar 1950).\nWe now demonstrate that this backradiation is dominated by\ntwo-level scattering. The line source function for complete redistribution can be written as:\nS \u03bdl 0 = (1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd0 \u2212 \u03b7\u03bd0 ) J \u03bd0 + \u03b5\u03bd0 B\u03bd0 (T ) + \u03b7\u03bd0 B\u03bd0 (T d )\n=\n\nJ \u03bd0 +\n\n\u03b5\u2032\u03bd0 B\u03bd0 (T ) + \u03b7\u2032\u03bd0 B\u03bd0 (T d )\n,\n1 + \u03b5\u2032\u03bd0 + \u03b7\u2032\u03bd0\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere J \u03bd0 is the profile-averaged mean intensity, \u03b5\u03bd0 the thermal\ndestruction probability, i.e., the fraction of line-photon extinctions by direct collisional deexcitation corrected for emissivity\nfrom spontaneous scattering, \u03b7\u03bd0 the fractional probability of all\nindirect detour extinction, with detour meaning any multi-level\npath from the upper to the lower level not including the direct\ntransition, corrected for stimulated detour emissivity, and \u03b5\u2032\u03bd0 and\n\u03b7\u2032\u03bd0 the corresponding ratios of such extinctions to the contribution by two-level scattering. The formal detour excitation temperature T d is given by (gu Dul )/(gl Dlu ) \u2261 exp(h\u03bd0 /kT d ) where\nDul is the summed transition probability (per second per particle in the upper level) of all detour upper-to-lower paths, Dlu for\nall detour lower-to-upper paths, and gl and gu are the statistical\nweights.\n8\n\nFig. 11. H\u03b1 source function comparisons for the FCHHT-B model.\nSolid: Planck function and total source function at line center. The latter has ticks at \u03c4\u03bd0 = 3, 1, 0.3.

Dashed and dot-dashed: two-level approximation (1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd0 ) J \u03bd0 +\n\u03b5\u03bd0 B\u03bd0 (T ) and profile-averaged mean intensity J \u03bd0 . These coincide everywhere.\n\nFractional collisional contribution \u03b5\u03bd0 [B\u03bd0 (T ) \u2212 J \u03bd0 ]/S \u03bdl 0\n(dashed) and detour contribution \u03b7\u03bd0 [B\u03bd0 (T d ) \u2212 J \u03bd0 ]/S \u03bdl 0 (dot-dashed)\nto the H\u03b1 line source function. Their sum (solid) represents (S \u03bdl 0 \u2212\nJ \u03bd0 )/S \u03bdl 0 . The ticks on the x-axis are at \u03c4\u03bd0 = 3, 1, 0.3 in H\u03b1.\n\nFig. 12.\n\nThe classic literature used Eq. 5 (e.g., Gebbie & Steinitz\n1974; Sect. 8.1 of Jefferies 1968; Eq. 12.11 of Mihalas 1970)\nfollowing Thomas (1957) who divided strong lines into \"collision type\" with \u03b5\u03bd0 > \u03b7\u03bd0 and \"photoelectric type\" with \u03b7\u03bd0 > \u03b5\u03bd0 ,\ndesignating H\u03b1 as principal example of the second type. In particular, H\u03b1 would gain most photons from Balmer ionization\nfollowed by a recombination path into n = 3 employing photospheric Balmer photons (e.g., Athay & Thomas 1961; see also\nCram 1985). The corresponding schematic source function diagram in Fig. 3 of Jefferies & Thomas (1959) (reprinted in\nFig. 12-9 of Mihalas 1970 and Fig. 11-11 of Mihalas 1978) is\nqualitatively similar to the FCHHT-B H\u03b1 behavior in Fig. 7, with\nS \u03bdl leveling out in the photosphere to become much higher than\nB\u03bd in the temperature minimum.\nHowever, in the FCHHT-B case this behavior is due to\nthe backscattering from the chromosphere, not from Balmercontinuum detour emission. If the latter were important it would\nraise the H\u03b1 source function also for the Kurucz model. The\nBalmer continuum scatters outward similarly to the 2512 \u00c5 continuum in Fig. 5, the same in both models up to h \u2248 800 km,\nwith about 1400 K radiation temperature excess in the temperature minimum \u2013 but that region is transparent in H\u03b1.\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nThe scattering nature of the H\u03b1 source function is demonstrated in Fig. 11 by comparing it with the mean radiation J \u03bd0\nand the two-level approximation. They are closely the same\neverywhere. The differences are magnified in Fig. 12 showing\nthe fractional collision and detour contributions. The collisional\ncontribution is negligible except in the deep photosphere where\ncollisional excitations create most H\u03b1 photons (with \u03b5\u03bd0 \u2248 1 and\nJ \u03bd0 \u2248 B\u03bd0 ). The latter resonance-scatter outward. Higher up, the\ndetour contribution is much larger, confirming the \u03b7\u03bd0 /\u03b5\u03bd0 evaluation of Al et al. (2004), but it still amounts to only a few percent\nof the line source function and raises the line-center intensity by\nonly one percent of the continuum intensity. In the steep temperature rise of the FCHHT-B transition region the detour contribution grows rapidly to nearly 100%, but at negligible H\u03b1 opacity\nand therefore of no importance to the emerging profile \u2013 and not\ndue to photospheric irradiation.\nThe conclusion from this section is that in the FCHHT-B\nmodel H\u03b1 is first and foremost a scattering line, with chromospheric backscattering boosting the line-center radiation across\nthe opacity gap between photosphere and chromosphere. The\nH\u03b1 core emerges from the FCHHT-B chromosphere but most\nphotons were created in the deep photosphere. For H\u03b1 the\nFCHHT-B chromosphere is primarily a scattering attenuator that\nbuilds up its own irradiation from below. The main source function difference with other strong scattering lines such as the Ca ii\nresonance lines and infrared triplet is the effect of the opacity\ngap, not the amount of detour contribution.\n\n7. Discussion\nStatic 1D modeling of the continua from the solar atmosphere\nhas reached such sophistication that even the modelers themselves may misinterpret their results (Sect. 5). Interpretation of\nchromospheric fine structure using strong lines, in particular H\u03b1,\nhas relied more on cloud modeling (see the excellent review by\nTziotziou 2007) than on static model-atmosphere interpretation\nas in Sect. 6. In the meantime, observations of the actual chromosphere (Sect. 2) have reached such spatial and temporal resolution that the worlds of the modelers and the observers now seem\nfar apart. A third worldview is given by time-dependent numerical MHD simulations of the chromosphere (e.g., Schaffenberger\net al. 2006; Leenaarts et al. 2007, 2010; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sykora et al.\n2011). Obviously, the different views should come together. It\nfalls outside the scope of this paper to effectuate such synthesis,\nbut we make a few salient points.\nEmergent spectrum fitting. The FCHHT-B model and the AL-\n\nC7 model of Avrett & Loeser (2008) fit the ultraviolet atlases\nabout equally well, but differ appreciably in their stratifications\n(Fig. 2) and in their stratification physics. Both assume hydrostatic equilibrium, but the AL-C7 model gains additional chromospheric support from imposed turbulent pressure inspired by\nobserved line broadening, as in its VAL and FAL predecessors.\nThe FCHHT-B model gains chromospheric support instead from\nimposed non-gravitational acceleration inspired by the FarleyBuneman instability (Fontenla et al. 2008). Thus, best-fit model\ndetermination from such data does not represent a unique data\ninversion.\nAn extreme example of non-uniqueness is that the two disparate H\u03b1 formations in Fig. 7, with and without a chromosphere, can both fit the observed average H\u03b1 profile (top panel of\nFig. 8). Figure 1 obviously suggests that chromospheric H\u03b1 formation as in the FCHHT-B model is more realistic than photo-\n\nspheric H\u03b1 formation as in the Kurucz model, but the predicted\nH\u03b1 profile cannot be used as discriminator.\nOne-dimensional continuum modeling. The similarity of the\n\nmagnetogram, 1700 \u00c5 and Ca ii H panels in Fig. 1 suggests that\n1D modeling along vertical columns which differs between internetwork, network, and plage may be a reasonable approximation for ultraviolet continua from these features. The bright\ngrains that constitute network and plage mark strong-field structures that are roughly vertical. However, facular modeling towards the limb must then account for slanted viewing across\nsuch structures by cutting through different 1D models along the\nline of sight, as in the classic Z\u00fcrich fluxtube modeling of e.g.,\nB\u00fcnte et al. (1993).\nCloud modeling. The FCHHT-B chromosphere may be re-\n\ngarded as an horizontally extended isothermal slab but not as a\nconstant-property cloud since it is more like a finite atmosphere,\nwith density stratification, outward S \u03bd decay, and EddingtonBarbier-like H\u03b1 core formation. The source function is dominated by scattering (Fig. 11) and the slab is effectively thin\n(Fig. 9) so that the source function amplitude depends on the slab\nopacity. Due to backscattering, the H\u03b1 profile illuminating the\nslab from below (dotted curve in the bottom panel of Fig. 8) is\nshallower than for locations without an overlying chromospheric\nblanket (Kurucz prediction in the top panel of Fig. 8; cf. Bostanci\n& Al Erdo\u011fan 2010) and brightens for a thicker blanket. If actual\nfibrilar canopies share such properties than these upset classical\ncloud modeling.\nAt the suggestion of the referee, we added in the middle\npanel of Fig. 8 the outward intensity profile at that optical depth\nin the Kurucz model which equals the optical thickness of the\nFCHHT-B chromosphere. It is similar to the outward intensity\nprofile impinging the latter (bottom panel) because the line formation is much more similar for the two models on optical depth\nscales than on geometrical height scales. The near-equality of\nthese profiles suggests a new recipe for 1D H\u03b1 cloud modeling, namely to use the outward intensity profile in a radiativeequilibrium photosphere at optical depth equal to the cloud's\nthickness as impinging background profile.\nDynamics. The actual internetwork atmosphere above the pho-\n\ntosphere (in our view consisting of a cool clapotisphere, chromospheric fibril canopy, and a similar-morphology sheath-like\ntransition region) is continuously shocked. In H\u03b1 ubiquitous\ninternetwork shocks are evident in Doppler timeslices (e.g.,\nRutten et al. 2008; Cauzzi et al. 2009). In magnetic concentrations shocks are ubiquitous already in the photosphere.\nShocks also produce the dynamic fibrils jutting out from network (Hansteen et al. 2006; De Pontieu et al. 2007a). The elusive\nstraws / spicules-II / RBEs near network are even more dynamic.\nThis basic chromospheric dynamism upsets static chromosphere\nmodeling.\nDepartures from LTE. The FCHHT-B NLTE departures dis-\n\ncussed here reach two to three orders of magnitude at the\nFCHHT-B temperature minimum (Figs. 4, 10) while the lower\nlevel of H\u03b1 is nearly in LTE where the line forms (Fig. 10). The\nnon-equilibrium simulation of Leenaarts et al. (2007) predicts\noverpopulations of this level up to twelve orders of magnitude\nfor cool post-shock phases, where the temperature may fall well\n9\n\n\fR.J. Rutten et al.: Chromospheric backradiation\n\nbelow the temperature minima of the standard models (Leenaarts\net al. 2011). Thus, dynamic behavior may dramatically increase\nthe temperature variations and NLTE effects.\nHeight of the transition region. One-dimensional models for\n\ndifferent features typically differ primarily in the height of their\ntransition region. Simulations as the one of Leenaarts et al.\n(2007) suggest that the transition region above internetwork is\nkicked up and mass-loaded by field-guided flows that do not\nobey one-dimensional hydrostatic equilibrium. In this simulation the location of the transition region varies over h = 1000 \u2212\n4000 km, with rapid changes, and is generally lower above magnetic concentrations. Such larger range than in the 1D model\ngrids may better reflect actual variations in fibril-canopy height\nor corrugation.\nH \u03b1 opacity gap. The H\u03b1 opacity gap and backscattering into\nit are properties of the FCHHT-B model. Do they also occur in\nthe real Sun? The images in Fig. 1 roughly agree with FCHHT-B\npredictions: in the 1700 \u00c5 image no fibrils are seen whereas they\nappear opaque in the H\u03b1 image. Also, when one samples the\nreal Sun in H\u03b1 away from line center (e.g., in DOT movies2 ) the\nphotospheric granulation appears when the fibrils become transparent, without an intermediate clapotispheric scene as in the\nCa ii H and 1700 \u00c5 images in Fig. 1. Thus, a similar opacity gap\nseems to exist under the actual fibrilar canopies making up the\ninternetwork chromosphere. The radiation crossing it, boosted\nby backscattering, will suffer substantial spatial smoothing of\nthe photospheric scene. Some of it may leak out through an effectively thin fibril canopy, scatter around dark fibrils in photon\nchanneling as suggested by Al et al. (2004), or be seen from\naside as in the backradiation explanation of bright rims under\nfilaments (e.g., Kostik & Orlova 1975; cf. Panasenco 2010).\nH \u03b1 detour brightening. In the FCHHT-B model H\u03b1 is an almost pure scattering line (Fig. 11). The detour contribution\n\u03b7\u03bd0 (B\u03bd0 (T d ) \u2212 J \u03bd0 ) to the line source function becomes important only in the transparent transition region (Fig. 12). In the\nreal Sun locations with very bright H\u03b1, such as the moss and\nactive-region heart in Fig. 13 of Rutten (2007), may represent\nlow-lying, denser transition regions that radiate H\u03b1 through recombination paths.\n\n8. Conclusion\nThe development of standard models of the solar atmosphere,\nmasterminded by E.H. Avrett, represents a well-established pinnacle of sophistication with respect to the application of NLTE\nspectrum formation theory with the inclusion of numerous spectral features. However, the assumption of hydrostatic and timeindependent equilibria without magnetism remains a far cry\nfrom the actual solar chromosphere, which is pervaded by\nshocks and rapidly changing magnetic fine structure in even the\nquietest regions.\nConversely, state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics simulations do a good job in emulating the small-scale magnetodynamism of the actual solar atmosphere, but they remain weak\nin properly treating non-equilibrium radiation. Implementation\nof the art of the 1D modelers into the 3D time-dependent codes\nof the simulators presents a formidable challenge, but seems the\n2\n\n10\n\nhttp://www.staff.science.uu.nl/ \u0303 rutte101/dot\n\nmost promising venue to understand the enigmatic solar chromosphere (cf. Leenaarts et al. 2012).\nAcknowledgements. We thank E. Romashets, A. Sukhorukov and P. S\u00fctterlin\nand the SDO team for their contributions to Fig. 1, H.
