The physical conditions given here are\napplicable to remove ambiguity in various orbifold models.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe picture that physical quantities depend on the energy scale of interest is intuitive and\nhas provided a clue to understand laws of Nature. A probe with a shorter wavelength in\na system would resolve its substructure in a more microscopic way. If the substructures\nin the system are hierarchical, it can achieve predictability without knowledge of details\nat the other energy scales of the system. In a renormalizable quantum field theory in four\ndimensions, information for short and long distances is described well. Divergence that\nthe theory can have for short distance is subtracted. After renormalization conditions are\nimposed, physical quantities are finite and they are energy-scale dependent.\nThe energy-scale dependence of physical quantities is important not only for renormalizable interactions but also for non-renormalizable interactions. Renormalizable interactions are treated with no new counterterms once all the renormalizable interactions\nare included. In usual four-dimensional models, non-renormalizable interactions are supposed to be suppressed by the ratio of the energy scale of interest to the ultraviolet\nmomentum cutoff of the theory. In a four-dimensional theory where renormalizable and\nnon-renormalizable interactions coexist, physical quantities can be dominated by contributions from lower-dimensional operators being renormalizable terms. In a theory with\ncompactified extra dimensions, fields as four-dimensional modes can have dimension-four\noperators which are similar to renormalizable terms in four dimensions. From a standpoint\nthat non-renormalizable interactions are irrelevant operators and that their contributions\nto physical quantities are negligible, it is interesting to search for rules or orders for\npossible effects in higher-dimensional field theory at each given loop level.\nIn a theory with compactified extra dimensions, several characteristic properties need\nto be taken into account. They are higher-dimensional operators, regularization scheme\ndependence and brane terms. Even if the starting action integral includes all the operators\nup to a certain mass dimension, radiative corrections give rise to divergence for new local\noperators. Because higher-dimensional operators needed in the starting action integral\naffect the values of physical quantities, they must be determined in some ultraviolet\ncompletion or they must be found to be very small. As for scheme dependence, the\npoint is that degrees of divergence in higher dimensions can be higher. For example,\nif a four-dimensional integral produces logarithmic divergence, the corresponding fivedimensional divergence is expected to be linear divergence for a naive cutoff regularization.\nThis linear divergence can be missed in a dimensional regularization. It needs to be\nexamined whether such a regularization dependence occurs for physical effects. Finally\nfor brane terms, it was found that loop effects of bulk fields produce infinite contributions\nto require renormalization by couplings on branes [1]. Brane terms can be mass and\nkinetic energy terms and higher derivative operators can be needed as counterterms for\nloop corrections [3]-[8]. Research on effects of brane terms on mode functions and mass\nspectrum has also been developed in the literature [9]-[15]. In principle, the coefficients of\nbrane terms and higher-dimensional operators can be energy-scale dependent. In addition\nto divergence, the finite part of quantum corrections needs to be extracted for physical\nquantities.\nIn examining quantum loop effects, two-point functions include nontrivial information\nin higher-dimensional field theory. In \u03c64 theory in flat five dimensions on the S 1 /Z2,\nat one-loop level, there is no wave function renormalization. At two-loop level, divergences for wave function renormalization appear not only for p2 but also for (p2 )2 . This\nhigher-derivative term gives important information for consistency of the theory. The pre1\n\n\fdictability of the theory with (p2 )2 term requires the ultraviolet cutoff orders of magnitude\nlarger compared to the compactification scale [16]. One-loop wave function renormalization appears in Yukawa theory. On an orbifold, fermion self-energy has divergence on\nthe branes [1]. The corresponding fermion kinetic term not only in the bulk but also on\nthe branes need to be included in the starting action integral. At first sight, the relative\ncoefficient for the bulk and brane kinetic terms seems arbitrary. It is the case at tree\nlevel of the action integral. However, for the energy-dependence of physical effects, it is\ncrucial to include quantum effects. When one extracts such effects, it must be treated\ncarefully whether the relative coefficient is only apparent ambiguity. An analogy lies in\nfour-dimensional renormalizable field theory where coupling constants in tree-level action\nintegrals are free parameters. After renormalization, they are physical and momentum\ndependent. The difference is that in higher-dimensional field theory full information of\nnon-renormalizable interactions is unknown. To proceed phenomenological study without\nsuch an information, one might be content to assume that the relative coefficient can have\nvarious values. In this sense, the coefficient is akin to a free parameter. One important\npoint is to pay attention to physical consequences. It is nontrivial whether all the nonrenormalizable interactions are necessary for making a physical prediction at low energies.\nThen one needs the relative coefficient that is not a free parameter and its behavior that is\nfound at low energies, whereas the momentum-scale dependence of the relative coefficient\nhas not been examined even in the leading level in the literature.\nIn this paper, we examine the momentum-scale dependence of fermion self-energy associated with wave function renormalization in Yukawa theory in flat five dimensions on\nthe S 1 /Z2 . At one-loop level, wave function renormalization is needed as in four dimensions. One-loop divergence can be subtracted with only two renormalization constants in\nthe bulk and on the branes. We show that the bulk and brane parts of the self-energies\nare uniquely determined with requiring physical conditions. Our physical condition is\nthat fields with their physical masses obey usual Feynman propagators. This is sufficient\nbecause a relative difference between left- and right-handed components for fermions is\nrelated to the difference between the coefficients of the bulk and brane kinetic terms. With\nthis procedure, the momentum-scale dependence of the renormalized self-energies is given\nand the distribution of the bulk and brane parts can be found at low and high energies.\nWhile the loop-momentum integral depends on the regularization scheme, the renormalized self-energy is scheme-independent. We find that the ratio of the bulk contribution\nto the brane contribution depends on the momentum-scale in a very mild way, so that\nthe relative coefficient of bulk and brane kinetic terms can be regarded as approximately\nconstant for the leading quantum effect.\nThe physical condition given here is applicable to remove ambiguity in various orbifold\nmodels. Following the recent discovery of marginal and interacting operators in models\nwith extra dimensions [17], we also give the low-energy behavior of bulk and brane kinetic\nterms by the distance-rescaling for integrating out the shell of high-momentum degrees\nof freedom. It would be important to speculate what arises at higher-loop level. The\nregularization-scheme independence may not be kept beyond the leading level. We discuss\na viewpoint of the regularization-scheme dependence for physical quantities at higher-loop\nlevel.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the model with brane kinetic terms\nis given. The basic idea of our proposal to determine the relative coefficient is described.\nIn Section 3, the one-loop divergence is given and is subtracted with the corresponding\ncounterterms. In Section 4, the physical condition is given for renormalization. The\n2\n\n\fmomentum dependence of fermion self-energy is examined. In Section 5, we give the lowenergy behavior of bulk and brane operators by the distance-rescaling. We conclude in\nSection 6 with some remarks. A five-dimensional Yukawa theory on the orbifold S 1 /Z2 is\ngiven in Appendix A. The method we employ for calculation of quantum loop corrections\nis exemplified in Appendix B. At one-loop level, bulk and brane divergences in the fivedimensional Yukawa theory are found. Details of mode functions and their orthogonality\nand normalization are shown in Appendix C.\n\n2\n\nModel: brane kinetic terms and mode functions\n\nWe consider a theoretical improvement of a five-dimensional Yukawa theory on the orbifold\nS 1 /Z2 . The notation is given in Appendix A. The theory has divergence on the branes.\nThe corresponding counterterms are needed. We focus on the effect of brane terms on\nthe kinetic energy term. Brane kinetic terms need to be included in the beginning,\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndy A\u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/)\u03c8 + B \u03c8\u0304L (i\u2202/)\u03c8L (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) ,\n(2.1)\n\nR L+\u01eb\nR\nwhere the integral 21 lim\u01eb\u21920 \u2212L+\u01eb dy is denoted as dy. The factors A and B are unknown\nconstants. Either of these constants, for example, A can be deleted by redefinition of \u03c8.\nThen the equation (2.1) reduces to\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndy \u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/)\u03c8 + a0 \u03c8\u0304L (i\u2202/)\u03c8L (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) .\n(2.2)\nThe coefficient a0 should become momentum-dependent after a renormalization. The\ndirectly-related radiative effect is fermion self-energy. This is given by the sum of bulk\nand brane contributions,\nZ\nR 4\nD \u03c8\u0304D\u03c8D\u03c6 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304ei d xL ,\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the Lagrangian L consists of bulk and brane terms and it is denoted as the fourdimensional effective Lagrangian with a Kaluza-Klein decomposition. The basic idea to\ndetermine the coefficient a0 is to require that the propagator of the fermion with a physical\nmass M at a renormalization point is given by\ni\ni\ni\n=\nPL +\nPR ,\n/p \u2212 M + i\u01eb\n/p \u2212 M + i\u01eb\n/p \u2212 M + i\u01eb\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere PL and PR denote projection matrices for left- and right-chiralities, respectively. In\nthe equation (2.4), left and right contributions are required to be equal at the renormalization point. As for the Lagrangian, left and right components have different terms as\nin Eq. (2.2) and the resulting radiative corrections are expected to be different between\nleft- and right-chiralities. It is the relative coefficient a0 that removes this difference by\nthe renormalization, while the common part of divergence is removed by the bulk renormalization constant. We will show this occurs in the following sections.\nTo treat the renormalization, we define the wave function renormalization factor and\nthe rescaled field,\n\u03c8 = Z 1/2 \u03c8r .\n3\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fSubstituting the rescaled field into the Lagrangian (2.2) yields\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndy Z \u03c8\u0304r (i\u2202/)\u03c8r + a0 Z \u03c8\u0304rL (i\u2202/)\u03c8rL (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L))\nZ\n\u0002\n=\ndy \u03c8\u0304r (i\u2202/)\u03c8r + a \u03c8\u0304rL (i\u2202/)\u03c8rL (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L))\n\u0003\n+\u03b4Z \u03c8\u0304r (i\u2202/)\u03c8r + \u03b4a \u03c8\u0304rL (i\u2202/)\u03c8rL (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere a is a renormalized brane coupling and the renormalization constants are denoted\nas \u03b4Z \u2261 Z \u2212 1 and \u03b4a \u2261 a0 Z \u2212 a.

The other indications l + m 6= n and n + m 6= l are similar.\n\n3\n\nOne loop divergence and subtraction\n\nFor the model given in the previous section, we calculate fermion self-energy. The method\nis given in Appendix B. We discuss correspondences between the divergences and the\ncounterterms in the Lagrangian (2.14).\n\n3.1\n\nDivergent part\n\nThe first diagram we calculate is the one to have the left-handed fermions with mode n\nin the external lines. The diagrams are shown in Figure 1. The internal lines are taken\n\nFigure 1: Self-energy diagrams for \u03c8L .\nas \u03c8Rm and \u03c6l . The modes m and l are summed. With the equation (2.20), the selfenergy up to the propagators for the external lines is calculated similarly to the one for\nthe diagrams in Figures 5 and 1. The divergence of /p term is found as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010\na\u0011\n\u039bL\ng2\n2 2\n(ip\n/) \u221a \u2212 log(\u039b L ) * PL .\n1\u2212\n(3.1)\n2L(4\u03c0)2\nL\n\u03c0\nIn the limit a \u2192 0, this reduces to the simplest-model result (B.13) for ((a) + (b) + (c)) in\nFigure 1. The liner divergence \u039bL and the logarithmic divergence log(\u039b2 L2 ) correspond\nto bulk and brane terms, respectively. This is similar to Eq. (B.18) in the simplest model.\n6\n\n\fThe divergence (3.1) is subtracted with a linear combination \u03b4Z and \u03b4a for the diagonal\ncomponent in Eq. (2.14). For the case with external right-handed fermions, divergent\npart includes a similarly to Eq. (3.1). For both of left- and right-handed fermions, the\nbulk divergence needs to be subtracted with the identical counterterm.\nThe next diagram is the one with \u03c8Ln and \u03c8Ls in the external lines and with \u03c8Rm and\n\u03c6l in the internal lines where the modes m and l are summed. In this case, the divergent\npart for /p term is\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\ng2\n3a\n4a \u039bL\n1 + (\u22121)n+s\n2 2\n\u221a * PL\n\u2212 1\u2212\nlog(\u039b L ) \u2212\n(3.2)\n(ip\n/)\n2L(4\u03c0)2\n2\n2L\n3L \u03c0\n\nThe linear divergence \u039bL appears as effects of non-zero a because the Yukawa coupling\n(2.20) violates Kaluza-Klein number conservation at tree level. To subtract this divergence, the bulk kinetic terms in the original action integral seems to need non-diagonal\ncomponents with respect to Kaluza-Klein modes. Introduction of the bulk off-diagonal\ncomponents might be accomplished when the five-dimensional action integral is regarded\nas an effective action in even higher dimensional theory. While such a modification is\npossible, it would be important to identify how the bulk and brane kinetic terms in an\neffective theory vary their leading contributions with the change of momentum scale. At\nleast, it is found that the divergences in the limit a \u2192 0 are completely subtracted with\nthe counterterms in Eq. (2.14). We leave a further modification of the original action for\nfuture work.\n\n3.2\n\nFinite part\n\nSo far we have focused on the divergent part in radiative corrections. To obtain momentum\ndependence of wave function renormalizations, the finite part needPto be derived.\n\u221e\nWe consider the sum ((a) + (b) + (c)) in Figure 1. From\ns=\u2212\u221e term, we find\nlinear divergence in the bulk with a cutoff regularization. This is the five-dimensional\ncorrespondent of a four-dimensional logarithmic divergence. On the other hand, the same\nfour-dimensional divergence is expressed as \u0393(2\u2212d/2)|d=4\u2212\u01eb = \u0393(\u01eb) \u2248 1/\u01eb\n\u221a in a dimensional\nregularization. In five dimensions, \u0393(2 \u2212 d/2)|d=5 = \u0393(\u22121/2) = \u22122 \u03c0 is finite. The\nmomentum integral seems regularization-dependent. If physical quantities are sensitive\nto the way of the regularization, the predictability would be lost. In the present case,\nit will be found that regularization-dependent divergent terms are independent of the\nmomentum scale up to the overall /p. Such a momentum-independent shift is unphysical\nfor the renormalization. In Eq. (B.12), the sum part is written as\n!\nZ\n\u221e Z 1\n1\ng2 X\nd4 l\n1\nxp\n/ PL\n\u2212\ndx\n2L s=\u2212\u221e 0\n(2\u03c0)4 [l2 \u2212 \u2206s+ ]2 [l2 \u2212 \u2206s+ |p2 =0 ]2\nZ\n\u221e Z 1\ng2 X\nd4 l\nxp\n/\n+\ndx\nPL .\n(3.3)\n4\n2\n2L s=\u2212\u221e 0\n(2\u03c0) [l \u2212 \u2206s+ |p2 =0 ]2\n\nOnly the last term diverge and it corresponds to a constant shift. As seen in Eq. (B.18),\nall the divergence for this part and the others can be subtracted with only the two factors\n\u03b4Z and \u03b4a . In the contribution ((a)+(b)+(c)), the momentum-dependent part is obtained\nas\n\"\n\u0013#\n\u0012\nZ 1\n\u221e\nX\n\u2206\ng2\ns+\n(ip\n/)\nPL .

The momentum\ninsensitivity of the ratio is due to the analogous form seen in \u03a3\u0302bulk and \u03a3\u0302brane .\nFrom the result for the self-energy, it follows that the ratio of the brane contribution\nto the bulk contribution is almost constant with respect to the momentum-scale.

Therefore the relative coefficient between the bulk and brane kinetic terms has been determined without ambiguity.\n\n5\n\nBulk and brane operators in the distance-rescaling\n\nIn this section, we discuss the issue of relevant, irrelevant and marginal operators for bulk\nand brane terms to identify a general low-energy behavior of quantum corrections in the\nfield-theoretical context.\nIn Ref.

The coupling constant is\ngiven by g \u2032 = b0 g and the corresponding interaction is a marginal operator.\nIf the spacetime is flat with the rescaling x\u2032 = bx and y \u2032 = by, the action integral\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n4\n\u03bc\n2\nd xdy \u03c8\u0304i\u03b3 \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6) \u2212 g \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\u03c6 ,\n(5.4)\n2\nis rescaled into\nZ\n\n4\n\n\u0014\n\nd xdy \u03c8\u0304\n\n\u2032\n\ni\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u03c8 \u2032\n\n\u0015\n1 \u2032 \u2032 2\n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 ) \u2212 g \u03c8\u0304 \u03c8 \u03c6 .\n2\n\n(5.5)\n\nHere the field redefinition is given by \u03c8 \u2032 = b\u22122 \u03c8 and \u03c6\u2032 = b\u22123/2 \u03c6. The coupling constant\nis given by g \u2032 = b1/2 g and the corresponding operator is an irrelevant operator.\nNow we consider the sum of bulk and brane terms. In the flat spacetime, the action\nintegral is given by\nZ\nZ\n4\nd xdy Lbulk (\u03c8, \u03c6) + d4 xdy Lbrane (\u03c8, \u03c6)\u03b4(y \u2212 yi ),\n(5.6)\nwhere yi denote the positions of branes. For the rescaling in the flat spacetime, the action\nintegral is written as\nZ\nZ\n4 \u2032\n\u2032 \u22125\n2 \u2032 3/2 \u2032\nd x dy b Lbulk (b \u03c8 , b \u03c6 ) + d4 x\u2032 dy \u2032b\u22125 Lbrane (b2 \u03c8 \u2032 , b3/2 \u03c6\u2032 )\u03b4(y \u2032 \u2212 yi\u2032 )b.\n(5.7)\nThe brane terms are multiplied by the factor b compared to the bulk terms. This shows\nthat in the flat spacetime brane kinetic terms are small compared to bulk kinetic terms.\nIn the Randall-Sundrum spacetime, the action integral corresponding to Eq. (5.6) is\ngiven by\nZ\nZ\np\np\n4\nd xdz detgM N Lbulk (\u03c8, \u03c6; gM N ) + d4 xdz detgM N Lbrane (\u03c8, \u03c6; gM N )kz\u03b4(z \u2212 zi ).(5.8)\n\nFor the rescaling in the Randall-Sundrum spacetime, the action integral is written as\nZ\np\n\u22128\n3 \u2032 2 \u2032 \u22122 \u2032\n\u2032\nd4 x\u2032 dz \u2032 detgM\nN b Lbulk (b \u03c8 , b \u03c6 ; b gM N )\nZ\np\n\u22128\n3 \u2032 2 \u2032 \u22122 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+ d4 x\u2032 dz \u2032 detgM\n(5.9)\nN b Lbrane (b \u03c8 , b \u03c6 ; b gM N )kz \u03b4(z \u2212 zi ).\n12\n\n\fBecause kz\u03b4(z \u2212 zi ) = kz \u2032 \u03b4(z \u2032 \u2212 zi\u2032 )b0 , the brane kinetic terms are the same order as the\nbulk kinetic terms.\nOur method to determine the momentum-dependence of the bulk and brane contributions has been given in the flat spacetime. In the flat spacetime, the bulk interactions\nand the brane kinetic terms tend to be irrelevant operators. Thus our explicit analysis\nmay be regarded as the proposal of an idea in a simplified model. On the other hand,\nin the Randall-Sundrum spacetime, these operators tend to be marginal operators. In\nthe four-dimensional theory, marginal operators are renormalizable terms and low-energy\nquantum corrections are consistently treated without an additional ultraviolet completion. The idea needs to be examined further in models where the bulk interactions and\nthe brane kinetic terms are marginal operators.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have examined energy-scale dependence of fermion self-energy associated with wave\nfunction renormalization in Yukawa theory in flat five dimensions on the S 1 /Z2 . At\none-loop level, wave function renormalization is needed as in four dimensions. One-loop\ndivergence can be subtracted with only the two renormalization constants \u03b4Z and \u03b4a in the\nbulk and on the branes. We have shown that the bulk and brane parts of the self-energies\nare uniquely determined with requiring physical conditions. The physical condition is that\nfields with their physical mass obey usual Feynman propagators. In the present setup, for\nthe right-handed component the bulk part of the self-energy is immediately fixed. The\nleft-handed component determines the other renormalization factor. With this procedure,\nmomentum-scale dependence of the renormalized self-energies has been given. While the\nloop integral has linear divergence in the cutoff regularization, the renormalized self-energy\ndoes not give rise to regularization-scheme dependence. As an explicit equation, the bulk\npart of the renormalized self-energy is rewritten as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd (1)\n(1)\n(1)\n.\n(6.1)\n\u03a3 (p\n/)\n\u03a3\u0302bulk (p\n/) = \u03a3bulk (p\n/) \u2212 \u03a3bulk (p5 ) \u2212 /p\ndp\n/ bulk\np\n/=p5\n(1)\n\nFrom this equation, it is seen that a constant shift of \u03a3\u0302 bulk is unphysical. The case of\n\u03a3\u0302brane is similar. We have also found that the ratio of the bulk contribution to the brane\ncontribution depends on the momentum scale within less than 0.1%, so that the relative\ncoefficient of bulk and brane kinetic terms can be regarded as approximately constant for\nthe leading quantum effect. The value of the relative coefficient has been estimated as\n0.42 for the parameter set given in Section 4. Because the value is not extremely small,\nit would affect the prediction in phenomenological applications such as collider physics.\nThe quantitative estimation depends on the model.\nAnalysis beyond the leading level is an open question. In the equation (3.2), divergence\nfor the off-diagonal component with respect to Kaluza-Klein modes has been found. To\nsubtract this divergence, the original action integral would need the corresponding counterterms. As mentioned below Eq. (3.2), linear divergence for the off-diagonal component\nmay correspond to five-dimensional terms in higher-dimensional spacetime. The necessity\nof new local operators order by order is nothing but non-renormalizability. A possible\nway to proceed is to show that such local operators are irrelevant. In the present analysis,\nthe relative coefficient of the brane terms to the bulk term is 0.42 which is not negligible.\nThe effects of new operators should be treated carefully. As for regularization-scheme\n13\n\n\fdependence, it needs to be checked whether the scheme independence is kept at higherloop level. Because the loop-integral is scheme dependent even at the leading level, the\nmomentum-dependent part for any physical quantities might be contributed from such a\neffect. A viewpoint of this issue is given in the following. When our interest is low energy\nbehavior of physical quantities, details of the scheme-dependent part may not be required.\nThen we do not need to show that the prediction is exactly scheme independent. Rather,\nit is sufficient that the scheme-dependence is negligible at low energies. In addition, our\nanalysis has focused on wave function renormalization for two-point functions. To define\na physical mass, mass renormalization should be treated appropriately.\nFinally we emphasize that the physical conditions given here are applicable to remove\nambiguity in various orbifold models. We have also shown that both of the bulk and\nbrane kinetic terms are marginal operators in the Randall-Sundrum spacetime. It would\nbe worthwhile to identify the momentum-dependence of bulk and brane contributions in\nsuch models.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by Scientific Grants from the Ministry of Education and Science,\nGrant No. 20244028.\n\n14\n\n\fA\n\nYukawa theory on an orbifold\n\nWe consider a five-dimensional Yukawa theory on the orbifold S 1 /Z2.

The appearance of divergence on the branes in a similar setup is\nshown in Ref. [1]. For the calculation of quantum loop corrections, the steps we perform\ncontain the Kaluza-Klein mode expansion, the summation of diagrams, the replacement\nof fractions with a formula for the Gamma function and the representation with the\nPoisson summation for the summation of the Kaluza-Klein modes. In this appendix, we\ngive explicit equations at each step in the method to calculate self energy for the action\nintegral (A.1). The method will be used further in Section 3.\nThe first diagram is the self-energy for the left-handed fermion zero mode. The external\nlines are the left-handed zero mode \u03c7 and the internal lines are \u03c6n and \u03c8Rn . The internal\nlines are summed with respect to all n. The diagram is shown in Fig. 5.

The\ndivergence of the t integral is evaluated as\nZ \u221e\nh\nit=\u221e\n3\n1\ndt t\u2212 2 (1 + x(1 \u2212 x)p2 t + * * *) = \u22122t\u2212 2 + * * *\n= 2\u039b + finite,\n(B.6)\nt=\u039b\u22122\n\n0\n\nat the cutoff regularization. This momentum integral depends on the regularization\nscheme. The scheme-independence of the renormalized quantity will be shown in Section 4.

(B.7). The np 6= 0 part is\ng2\n5\n\n23 \u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c0 \u22122np L\u221a\u2212x(1\u2212x)p2\ndx x(ip\n/)\ne\nPL ,\n2n\nL\np\nn =1\n\n(B.8)\n\np\n\nwhere the integral for t has been performed with help of expressions for Bessel function\nK\u03bd . If a function F (x) is symmetric under the exchange x \u2194 1 \u2212 x, F (x) = F (1 \u2212 x),\nR1\nR1\nR1\nthen 0 dx xF (x) = 0 dx (1 \u2212 x)F (x) = (1/2) 0 dx F (x).

This is a usual four-dimensional integral. For the cutoff\nregularization, Eq.

For the self-energy withPthe field \u03c7 in the external lines, we have found linear divergence in the summation part \u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e and logarithmic divergence in the non-summation\npart.\nThe self-energy with the field \u03c8L in the external lines is analogous. Here there are\nvarious Kaluza-Klein modes to contribute. The internal lines are composed of \u03c6 and\n\u03c8R . The Kaluza-Klein modes for the external and internal lines are labeled as shown in\nFigure 1. The momentum flow is the same as in Figure 5. With the same procedure as\nin obtaining Eq. (B.2) from Eq. (B.1) for the diagram in Figure 5, the part /p in the sum\nof the diagrams (a), (b) and (c) in Figure 1 is obtained as\nZ\n\u221e Z 1\ng2 X\nd4 l\nxp\n/\n((a) + (b) + (c))|p/ =\ndx\nPL\n4\n2L s=\u2212\u221e 0\n(2\u03c0) [l2 \u2212 \u2206s+ ]2\nZ\nZ\ng2 1\nd4 l\nxp\n/\nPL\n\u2212\ndx\n4\n2\n2L 0\n(2\u03c0) [l \u2212 \u22060+ ]2\nZ\nZ\nd4 l\nxp\n/\ng2 1\ndx\n\u2212\nPL .\n2L 0\n(2\u03c0)4 [l2 \u2212 \u2206n+ ]2\n\n(B.12)\n\nHere \u2206s+ = \u2212x(1 \u2212 x)p2 + (s + (1 \u2212 x)n)2 \u03c0 2 /L2 + x(1 \u2212 x)n2 \u03c0 2 /L2 . The other \u22060+ and\n\u2206n+ are obtained from \u2206s + as \u22060+ = \u2206s+ |s=0 and \u2206n+ = \u2206s+ |s=n . The divergent part\nis given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng2\n\u039bL\n2 2\n(B.13)\n((a) + (b) + (c))|div =\n(ip\n/) \u221a \u2212 log(\u039b L ) * PL .\n2L(4\u03c0)2\n\u03c0\nFor the diagrams (d), (e), (f) and (g) in Figure 1, the external lines have n and n+2s. The\nmodes n and s in the internal lines are fixed for given external lines. These correspond\nto the non-sum part in Eq. (B.2). These diagrams satisfy (g) = (d) and (f) = (e). The\ndivergent part is\ng2\n(ip\n/) log(\u039b2 L2 ) * PL\n4L(4\u03c0)2\n= (f)|div = (e)|div .\n\n(d)|div = (g)|div = \u2212\n\n(B.14)\n\nThe self-energy with the fields \u03c7 and \u03c8L in the external lines is similarly calculated.\nThe other diagrams are the ones that have the right-handed field \u03c8R in the external\nlines. Similarly to diagrams with \u03c8L in an external line, the Kaluza-Klein modes are\nlabeled. For (a), (b), * * *, (g), there are the corresponding diagrams (a\u2032 ), (b\u2032 ), * * *, (g\u2032 ).\nThe amplitudes (a\u2032 ), (b\u2032 ), (c\u2032 ), (d\u2032 ) and (g\u2032 ) are given by (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) with PL\nreplaced by PR . The amplitudes (e\u2032 ) and (f\u2032 ) are given by (e) and (f) with PL replaced\nby PR and with the change of the overall sign. In addition to these diagrams, there is\na diagram with \u03c8R in the external lines and with \u03c7 and \u03c6 in the internal lines. This\ncontributes to the divergent part as\ng2\n(ip\n/) log(\u039b2 L2 ) * PR .\n2L(4\u03c0)2\n\n(B.15)\n\nThe equation (B.15) and the last term in Eq. (B.13) with the replacement PL by PR cancel\neach other. The contributions (d\u2032 ) and (e\u2032 ) cancel each other and (f\u2032 ) and (g\u2032 ) cancel each\n18\n\n\fother. In summary for the right-handed external lines, the remaining divergence is\n\u039bL\ng2\n(ip\n/ ) \u221a * PR .\n2\n2L(4\u03c0)\n\u03c0\n\n(B.16)\n\nThe logarithmic divergence for the external \u03c8R is canceled out.\nThe final step in the loop calculation is to identify Lagrangian terms corresponding to\nthe divergence. For all the divergences (B.13), (B.14) and (B.16), the Lagrangian terms\nare given by\n!\nX\n(\u2212i)g 2 \u039bL\n\u221a\n\u03c7\u0304L (ip\n/)\u03c7L +\n\u03c8\u0304n (ip\n/)\u03c8n\n2L(4\u03c0)2 \u03c0\nn\nn\nX\n(\u2212i)g 2\nlog(\u039bL)\n\u03c7\u0304\n(ip\n/\n)\u03c7\n+\n2\n\u03c8\u0304n,L (ip\n/)\u03c8n,L\n\u2212\nL\nL\n2L(4\u03c0)2\nn\nXX\n\u0001\n+2\n\u03c8\u0304n,L (ip\n/)\u03c8n+2s,L + \u03c8\u0304n+2s,L (ip\n/)\u03c8n,L\nn\n\ns\n\n\u221a X\n\u0001o\n+ 2\n\u03c7\u0304L (ip\n/)\u03c82n,L + \u03c8\u03042n,L (ip\n/)\u03c7L .\n\n(B.17)\n\nn\n\nFrom this equation, the Lagrangian terms with four-derivative are written in terms of the\nfive-dimensional field as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ L+\u01eb\n1\n\u039bL\ng2\n* lim\ndy \u221a \u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/)\u03c8 \u2212 log(\u039bL) \u03c8\u0304L (i\u2202/)\u03c8L (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) , (B.18)\n2L(4\u03c0)2 2 \u01eb\u21920 \u2212L+\u01eb\n\u03c0\nR L+\u01eb\nwhere lim\u01eb\u21920 \u2212L+\u01eb dy G(y) [\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)] = G(0) + G(L). The divergence in the brane\nterms for one-loop wave function occurs in the equal size at y = 0 and at y = L, in\nagreement with Ref. [1]. For the boundary condition (A.3), the right-handed component\n\u03c8R does not have the brane term. In the equation (B.18), the brane divergence includes\nnon-diagonal components with respect to Kaluza-Klein modes and the bulk divergence is\ndiagonal.\n\nC\n\nMode functions\n\nAccording to the approach given in Ref. [9], we derive fn and gn . The fermion mode\nfunctions appearing in the context, fn and gn , are fn III and gn III given in this appendix.\nFrom the equations of motion (2.8) and (2.9) and Eq. (2.10), the mode functions obey\n\u2202y fn = \u2212mn gn ,\n\u2202y gn = mn (1 + a (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L))) fn ,\n\n(C.1)\n(C.2)\n\nfor n 6= 1. From these equations, the second-order differential equation for fn is obtained\nas\n\u0001\n\u2202y2 + m2n + a m2n (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) fn = 0.\n(C.3)\n\nUnless confusion arises, we will omit the subscript for the Kaluza-Klein mode number n\nfor fn . The equation (C.3) includes two delta functions. It is convenient to write the\n19\n\n\fFigure 6: Regions. Allows depict \u03b4 functions\nfunction by defining separate regions in a period 2L. The regions can be classified as\nshown in Figure 6. In each region, the function f where is written as\nfI (y)\nfII (y)\nfIII (y)\nfIV (y)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nAeimy + Be\u2212imy ,\nCeimy + De\u2212imy ,\nEeimy + F e\u2212imy ,\nGeimy + He\u2212imy ,\n\n(C.4)\n(C.5)\n(C.6)\n(C.7)\n\nwhere A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are determined by 8 conditions. They are periodicity between\nthe regions I and III and between the regions II and IV, continuity at y = \u2212L, 0, L,\nmatching of the first derivative at y = \u2212L, 0, L and the normalization. Among the above\n9 conditions, one condition is automatically satisfied if the other conditions are satisfied.\nNow we fix these constants. The periodicity requires\nAeim(y\u22122L) + Be\u2212m(y\u22122L) = Eeimy + F e\u2212imy ,\nCeim(y\u22122L) + De\u2212m(y\u22122L) = Geimy + He\u2212imy .\n\n(C.8)\n(C.9)\n\nAe\u2212imL + BeimL = Ce\u2212imL + DeimL ,\nC + D = E + F,\nEeimL + F e\u2212imL = GeimL + He\u2212imL ,\n\n(C.10)\n(C.11)\n(C.12)\n\nThe continuity requires\n\nat y = \u2212L, 0, L, respectively. The matching of first derivative requires\n2\n[\u2202y fn ]II\nI + a mn fnI |y=\u2212L = 0,\n\n[\u2202y fn ]III\nII\n[\u2202y fn ]IV\nIII\n\n+\n\n+\n\nam2n fnII |y=0 = 0,\nam2n fnIII |y=L = 0,\n\n(C.13)\n(C.14)\n(C.15)\n\nat y = \u2212L, 0, L, respectively. Here fnI in the second term in Eq. (C.13) can be replaced\nby fnII because of the continuity (C.10). The equations (C.14) and (C.15) are understood\nsimilarly. In summary, the conditions up to normalization are\nAeim(y\u22122L) + Be\u2212im(y\u22122L) = Eeimy + F e\u2212imy ,\nCeim(y\u22122L) + De\u2212im(y\u22122L) = Geimy + He\u2212imy ,\nAe\u2212imL + BeimL = Ce\u2212imL + DeimL ,\nC + D = E + F,\n20\n\n(for 0+ \u2264 y \u2264 L\u2212 ), (C.16)\n(for L+ \u2264 y \u2264 2L\u2212 ), (C.17)\n(C.18)\n(C.19)\n\n\fEeimL + F e\u2212imL = GeimL + He\u2212imL ,\nCe\u2212imL \u2212 DeimL \u2212 A(1 + iam)e\u2212imL + B(1 \u2212 iam)eimL = 0,\nE \u2212 F \u2212 C(1 + iam) + D(1 \u2212 iam) = 0,\nGeimL \u2212 He\u2212imL \u2212 E(1 + iam)eimL + F (1 \u2212 iam)e\u2212imL = 0,\n\n(C.20)\n(C.21)\n(C.22)\n(C.23)\n\nwhere 0+ = lim\u01eb\u21920 0 + \u01eb and L\u2213 = lim\u01eb\u21920 L \u2213 \u01eb. Using the first three equations (C.16),\n(C.17) and (C.18), the fifth condition (C.20) is automatically satisfied. Hence, the above 7\nconditions and the normalization fix the 8 constants A, B, * * * , H. Up to the normalization,\nthe solution of the mode function f is given by\nfI (y)\nfII (y)\nfIII (y)\nfIV (y)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nA(eimy + w 3 e\u2212imy ),\nA(weimy + w 2 e\u2212imy ),\nA(w 2eimy + we\u2212imy ),\nA(w 3eimy + e\u2212imy ),\n\n(C.24)\n(C.25)\n(C.26)\n(C.27)\n\nwith the mass quantization condition\n\u2212 tan mL =\n\nam\n1\u2212\n\n\u0001 ,\nam 2\n2\n\n(C.28)\n\nwhich is also written as e\u22122imL = (2+iam)2 /(2\u2212iam)2 . Here wn \u2261 (2+iamn )/(2\u2212iamn ).\nThe orthogonality of the mode function can be found as follows. The mode function\nsatisfies the second-order differential equation (C.3). From this equation, the following\nequation is derived:\nZ L+\u01eb\nn\n\u0001\n1\n0 = lim\ndy fm \u2202y2 + m2n + am2n (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) fn\n2 \u01eb\u21920 \u2212L+\u01eb\n\u0001 o\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212fn \u2202y + mm + amm (\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(y \u2212 L)) fm .\n(C.29)\nIt is found that the mode function satisfies\n\nlim(fm \u2202y fn )IV,L+\u01eb = Am An (wm + 1)\u2212imm L (wn \u2212 1)imn e\u2212imn L\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n= lim(fm \u2202y fn )II,\u2212L+\u01eb ,\n\n(C.30)\n\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nand\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u2212L\n\ndy fIIn (y)fIIm (y) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd(\u2212y) fIIn (\u2212y)fIIm (\u2212y) =\n\nL\n\nZ\n\nL\n\ndy fIIIn (y)fIIIm (y).
