Of these stars, 79 are UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)\nstandards from Hawarden et al., and 42 are Las Campanas Observatory (LCO, or\nNICMOS) standards from Persson et al. The average brightness of the sample in all\nthree bandpasses is 11.5 magnitudes, with a range between 10 and 15. The average\nnumber of nights each star was observed is 4, and the average of the internal error of\nthe final results is 0.m 011. These JHK data agree with those reported by other groups\nto 0.m 02, for stars in common, which is consistent with the uncertainties. The measurements are used to derive colour transformations between the MKO JHK photometric\nsystem and the UKIRT, LCO and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) systems.\nThe 2MASS\u2212MKO data scatter by 0.m 05 for redder stars, which is consistent with\na dependence on stellar luminosity: the 2MASS J bandpass includes H2 O features\nin dwarfs and the MKO K bandpass includes CO features in giants. We stress that\ncolour transformations derived for stars whose spectra contain only weak features cannot give accurate transformations for objects with strong absorption features within\none, but not both, of the filter bandpasses. We find evidence of systematic effects at\nthe 0.m 02 level in the photometry of stars with J < 11 and H,K < 10.5 presented here\nand in Hawarden et al.. This is due to an underestimate of the linearity correction for\nstars observed with the shortest exposure times; very accurate photometry of stars\napproaching the saturation limits of infrared detectors which are operated in doubleread mode is difficult to obtain. There are indications that four stars in the sample,\nGSPC S705-D, FS 116 ( B216-b7), FS 144 (Ser-EC84) and FS 32 (Feige 108), may\nbe variable. There are 84 stars in the sample presented here that have 11 < J < 15\nand 10.5 < H,K < 15, are not suspected to be variable, and have magnitudes with\nan estimated error 6 0.m 027; 79 of these have an error of 6 0.m 020. These represent\nthe first published high-accuracy JHK stellar photometry in the MKO near-infrared\nphotometric system; we recommend these objects be employed as primary standards\nfor that system.\nKey words: infrared:stars \u2013 instrumentation: photometers \u2013 techniques: photometric\n\u2013 methods: observational.\n\n\f2\n1\n\nS. K. Leggett et al.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the 1990's infrared astronomy changed radically when\narray cameras started to replace single-channel photometers. Not only did the field of view and spatial resolution increase markedly, but much fainter limits could be\nreached. One repurcussion was that the existing photometric standards were too bright for the new detectors, and\nmany groups published lists of fainter standards. These included: Bouchet et al. (1991); Casali & Hawarden (1992);\nHunt et al. (1998); Persson et al. (1998); Hawarden et al.\n(2001); Guetter et al. (2003).\nTowards the end of the 1990's and extending into this\ndecade, modern infrared sky surveys have come on line.\nTo maximise the output from the surveys requires a wellunderstood photometric system and a large grid of standard stars. Calibration of the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS) is described in Cohen et al. (2003) and of the Deep\nNear-Infrared Survey (DENIS) in Fouqu\u00e9 et al. (2000). Even\ndeeper surveys have now started at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT, the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky\nSurvey or UKIDSS, see Hewett et al. (2006)), and at the\nCanada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT, their WIRCAM\ninstrument, Puget et al. (2004)).\nAnother area of recent improvement is photometry at\nlonger infrared wavelengths. The UKIRT group presented\n4-5\u03bcm L\u2032 M \u2032 standards in Leggett et al. (2003). Also, Cohen and collaborators have produced a series of papers extending absolute flux calibrations from the near-infrared to\nthe mid-infrared, with particular application to mid-infrared\nsatellites. The first paper and the most recent paper in this\nseries, respectively, are Cohen et al. (1992) and Price et al.\n(2004). Calibration of the recently launched Spitzer infrared\nspace telescope is described by Reach et al. (2005).\nDespite this progress, a fundamental problem remained\nfor infrared astronomers \u2013 there was no single filter set or\nphotometric system. Not only did this mean that it was\ndifficult to compare data, but existing filters tended to be\ntoo broad and include poor regions of the atmosphere, leading to additional noise and thus lower-accuracy data. This\nsituation was resolved when A. Tokunaga formed a consortium to purchase a set of well-defined filters that better matched the atmospheric windows (Simons & Tokunaga\n2002; Tokunaga, Simons & Vacca 2002; Tokunaga & Vacca\n2005). These filters have now been widely adopted; as well\nas UKIRT (and UKIDSS) the following facilities have purchased Mauna Kea Observatory (MKO) near-infrared filter\nsets: Arizona, Boston, Cornell, Florida, Hawaii, Kyoto, Montreal, Ohio State, Tohoku, Tokyo, Virginia and Wyoming\nUniversities; the Anglo-Australian Observatory, CalTech,\nCenter for Astrophysics, CFHT, European Southern Observatory, Gemini, Grenoble Observatory, the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility, the Isaac Newton Group, Keck, Korea\nObservatory, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,\nNational Optical Astronomy Observatory, Nordic Optical\nTelescope, Osservatorio Astrofisico de Arcetri, Rome Observatory, and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo.\nIn this paper we present a set of standard stars observed\nat UKIRT using the UKIRT Fast Track Imager (UFTI) and\nJHK filters in the MKO system. The sample is described in\n\u00a72, the photometric system in \u00a73, the observing and analysis\ntechniques in \u00a74 and the results are given in \u00a75. Comparison\n\nFigure 1. JHK filter transmission profiles, where the dotted\nline includes typical site-dependent atmospheric effects. Central wavelengths and half-power bandwidths are indicated for\nfilter+atmosphere profiles. See Tokunaga & Vacca (2005) for a\ndiscussion of isophotal and effective wavelengths for the MKO\nfilter set.\n\nto published observations of the sample are given in \u00a76. Our\nconclusions are given in \u00a77.\n\n2\n\nTHE SAMPLE\n\nThe sample consists primarily of UKIRT Faint Standards\n(Hawarden et al. 2001) and Las Campanas (LCO, or NICMOS) standards (Persson et al. 1998). Two stars from\nHawarden et al., FS 18 and 118, have been removed from this\nsample due to the presence of a nearby star that makes aperture photometry less accurate. Three additional unreddened\nA0 stars, or stars with zero colours, were taken from Landolt\n(1992). Such stars are useful for extrapolating magnitudes\nto other bandpasses.

(1998: LCO) and the 2MASS filters. Colour transformations between these systems are discussed in \u00a76.2. Profiles\nare shown with and without atmospheric absorption. Atmospheric transmissions appropriate for each site were taken\nfrom the sources given by Stephens & Leggett (2004). The\nJ and K MKO filters are narrower than the other filter sets\n(except for 2MASS Ks ) to avoid the poor regions of the atmospheric windows. The 2MASS and UKIRT J-band filters\nare particularly prone to atmospheric absorption and therefore noise. For further discussion, see Simons & Tokunaga\n(2002) and Tokunaga, Simons & Vacca (2002).\n\n3.2\n\nOptical Elements\n\nAs summarised in Hawarden et al. (2001); Leggett et al.\n(2003); Stephens & Leggett (2004), the commonly used\nnear-infrared optical elements have transmission or absorption wavelength responses that are flat across the JHK filter bandpasses. Hence instrument and telescope optics typically do not significantly affect the photometric system.\nHawarden et al. (2001) found that even changes in UKIRT's\noptical/infrared dichroic coating did not affect the J bandpass. Stephens & Leggett (2004) did find that, for the very\nstructured spectra of late L and T dwarfs, the variations between detector quantum efficiency and anti-reflection coatings can affect measured magnitudes by up to 1%. However\nfor stars with a more typical spectral energy distribution,\nsuch as those in this sample, these effects are negligible.\nHence the results presented here are appropriate for any\ncamera equipped with the JHK MKO filters and a detector\nwith a reasonably flat sensitivity curve (such as UKIRT's\nWide Field Camera WFCAM \u2013 but see further discussion in\n\u00a76.2).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nTECHNIQUES\nObservations\n\nAll observations presented here were made at UKIRT using the UKIRT Fast Track Imager, UFTI (Roche et al.\n2003). UFTI contains a HAWAII-I HgCdTe detector, with\n1024\u00d71024 0.091 arcsecond pixels. For standard star observations a 512\u00d7512 subarray readout was used, allowing minimum exposure times of 1 second. UFTI was outfitted with\nMKO filters from its commissioning in 1998 October.\nThe data presented here were taken over 21 photometric\nnights between 2001 January 23 and 2004 December 29. 10\nto 50 standards were observed on whole or partial nights.\nOne to three would be repeated to measure the extinction\non each night and the stars would be observed between one\nand \u223ctwo airmasses. Exposure times ranged from 1 second\nto 60 seconds, but were usually around 8 seconds at J and\n4 seconds at H and K. On nights of very poor or very good\nseeing the exposure times would be adjusted to keep the\npeak data counts on the star between 500 and 4000 data\n\n5\n\nnumbers, as far as possible. Typically a five-position jitter\npattern was used with 10-arcsecond offsets. Nine-position\njitters were used for stars fainter than 15th magnitude.\n\n4.2\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe data were reduced using the ORAC-DR\npipeline (Cavanagh et al. 2003). Details of the reduction\nrecipes\n(JITTER SELF FLAT APHOT,\nBRIGHT POINT SOURCE APHOT) are presented in\nthe ORAC-DR Imaging Data Reduction User Guide1 ).\nORAC-DR uses various Starlink software packages to\nreduce astronomical data.\nThe raw image counts are first corrected for nonlinearity using the empirical correction determined at the\nobservatory in 2000 October:\ntrue = measured/(1 + (6.1.10\u22126 \u2217 measured))\nNote that the measured counts are larger than the corrected\ncounts. This relationship holds for measured counts fewer\nthan 10000 data numbers (DN) \u2013 above this limit the detector goes into hard saturation where measured counts will be\nmuch smaller than predicted. The non-linearity correction\nis small \u2013 around 2% at the typical value of 4000 counts. We\ndiscarded data where any pixel was higher than 10000 DN.\nThe raw images, and the engineering data used to derive\nthe non-linearity correction, were taken in non-destructive\nread mode, where the detector is reset, read out, exposed\nand read out again, and the counts in the stored image\nare the difference between the two reads. The linearity\ncorrection we have applied to the images is not strictly\ncorrect, as a correction should be applied to each individual read and not the difference (Persson et al. 1998;\nVacca, Cushing & Rayner 2004). However in \u00a76.3 we show\nthat the error is insignificant except for the brightest stars\nin the sample which were observed with exposure times similar to the array readout time; for these stars the effect is\nsmall but significant. Note that UFTI's non-linearity correction goes in the opposite sense to the more typical wellfilling saturation behaviour, where lower, not higher, counts\nwould be expected as signal increases. The somewhat unusual UFTI controller may be the cause of this linearity\nbehaviour. The controller is derived from the CIRSI controller (Beckett et al. 1998) which in turn is based on an\nLSR-Astrocam (later PerkinElmer Life Science) 4100 CCD\ncontroller. During the read of each pixel, a fast video switch\nin the interface switches between the real output of the array\nand a dummy level, to remove drifts.\nAfter correcting for non-linearity, each frame is badpixel masked, dark-subtracted and flat-fielded. Dark frames\nare taken with every star. Any darks that suffered from latent images are rejected. Flat fields are created from medianfiltered and object-masked jittered images of the fainter\nstandards. Object masking detects objects with 12 connected pixels at 1 \u03c3 above the sky level. The locations,\nshapes, orientations and sizes are used to make a mask which\nis applied to the dark-subtracted frames to generate the flat\nfield. Jittered frames of fainter stars are used to generate the\nflat field so that the background level is dominated by sky\n1\n\nhttp://www.starlink.ac.uk/star/docs/sun232.htx/sun232.html\n\n\f6\n\nS. K.

For UFTI, images taken with J exposure times > 20 seconds, and H and K exposure times >\n5 seconds, are background-noise-limited. For brighter standards that were not background-noise-limited, the closestin-time flat field, generated with a faint standard, was used.\nFinally, a mosaic is created from the flat-fielded jitter\nset of five or nine pointings. Aperture photometry is carried\nout on each source using a 7-arcsecond diameter aperture,\nwith sky annuli from 10.5 to 17.5 arcseconds. This is large\nenough to include all the light from the star even on nights\nof mediocre seeing, without compromising signal-to-noise.\nOn one night with poor seeing (20020217) an 8-arcsecond\naperture had to be used.\nORAC-DR reports photometric errors on each individual flat-fielded frame, as well as on the mosaic. For this work\nwe have conservatively adopted the uncertainty to be the\nstandard deviation in the mean of the measurements of a\njitter set. This standard deviation is 1\u20132%, compared to the\nmillimag-level error calculated by ORAC-DR from the sky\nvariance of the mosaic.\nZeropoint magnitudes are calculated for each measurement by subtracting the instrumental magnitude from the\ncatalogue magnitude. These zeropoints are plotted against\nairmass for each filter for each night. A linear extinction\ncurve is fitted to the data using the extinction star(s), and\neach catalogue magnitude adjusted so that the star would\nagree with the average zeropoint at an airmass of one, as defined by that night's sample. In this way we revised the standard stars' catalogue of JHK magnitudes after every observing run, such that the group became more self-consistent\nas time went on. The initial standard star catalogue consisted of UKIRT Faint Standard values transformed to the\nMKO system using the preliminary colour terms given in\nHawarden et al. (2001).\nFor this paper we re-reduced the data from all 21 nights\nusing the most recent version of the catalogue, to ensure that\nthe entire set was handled consistently. Linear extinction\ncurves were fitted for each night in each filter using the entire\nnight's data (i.e. not just the extinction stars). The scatter\naround this curve was 0.m 02 or less. A single J, H or K value\nwas calculated for each star for each night and these values\nthen averaged over all nights. The results are given in the\nnext section.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nRESULTS\nExtinction\n\nTable 2 lists our measured extinction values at JHK, determined by linear regression to the [airmass, zeropoint] values\n(for airmass ranging from 1 to around 2), for the sample of\n\nCalculated\nfor pwv:\n1mm\n4mm\n0.006\n0.005\n0.017\n\n0.014\n0.015\n0.019\n\n21 nights. The uncertainty in the nightly extinction value\nis \u223c 0.01 magnitudes/airmass. Water vapour measurements\nover these nights ranged from a 225 GHz \u03c4 of 0.04 to 0.27\n(average 0.10), corresponding to a precipitable water vapour\n(pwv) of between 1 and 5 mm (average 2 mm). We find no\ncorrelation between \u03c4 and extinction, as expected for these\nfilters which are well matched to the atmospheric windows.\nTokunaga, Simons & Vacca (2002) calculate the extinction\ndue to water vapour for the MKO filters, for 1 to 4 mm of\nwater vapour, and these values are given in Table 2. It can\nbe seen that the measured values are higher, which would be\nexpected as extinction due to scattering is not included in\nthe calculated values. T\u00fcg, White & Lockwood (1977), for\nexample, have shown that aerosol scattering is significant\nin the far red. The difference between the measured and\npredicted extinction values in Table 2 indicate that scattering can contribute between 0 and \u223c0.1 magnitudes/airmass\nto the extinction at JHK, on the summit of Mauna Kea.\nFor accurate photometry of targets with airmass differing\nsignificantly from their calibrators, the extinctions must be\ndetermined on each night.\n\n5.2\n\nJHK magnitudes\n\nTable 3 gives our weighted mean JHK magnitudes, the\nestimated error of that mean, and the number of nights\nthe star was observed in that filter. The estimated error\nis the\nof (1) the standard deviation of the mean, or\np larger\nP\n2\n(2) (1/ (1/\u03c3night\n)). Individual night's magnitudes have\nbeen omitted if they deviated by more than 3 \u03c3 (or typically > 0.m 03) from the mean, as defined by the value of \u03c3\nafter the omission. As the MKO filter set has been widely\nadopted because of its design advantages, and differs significantly from most earlier filter sets, including the UKIRT\nfilters used by Hawarden et al (2001), we recommend that\nthe present results are used instead of those of Hawarden et\nal., despite the latter's superior internal accuracy (0.m 005 cf.\n0.m 011).\nThe average number of nights each star was observed\nduring this programme is 4. One LCO standard star, GSPC\nS705-D, appears to be variable, as 4\u20135 measurements produced standard deviations of 3-6% across J, H and K.\nPersson et al. (1998), however, found a small 1% deviation over their four measurements of this star. The UKIRT\nstandard FS 144 (Ser-EC84) has been reported as possibly variable at the 5% level, and possibly binary (N. Cross,\nM. Connelley, private communications), although our three\nmeasurements agree to 3% at J and 1% at H and K.\nThere are two UKIRT standards for which the magnitudes\npresented here are fainter than the UKIRT-system values\n(Hawarden et al. 2001; Casali & Hawarden 1992) by \u223c0.m 1 :\n\n\fJHK Observations of Standard Stars\nTable 3.

FS 32\nand FS 116 are identified in the UKIRT plots and are excluded\nfrom those fits. The MKO, WFCAM and 2MASS JHK and J\nare fainter than the UKIRT-system values for FS 32 and FS 116,\nrespectively. The possible variables FS 144 and GSPC S705-D\nhave been omitted from all plots.\n\nFigure 3.

The 2MASS and preliminary WFCAM values\nagree with the present results to < 0.m 05, suggesting that a\nchange may have occurred between the epoch of the Casali &\nHawarden and Hawarden et al. observations (1991 and 1994\u2013\n1998, respectively) and that of the more recent 2MASS,\nMKO and WFCAM observations. We have indicated all four\nof these stars, GSPC S705-D, FS 144, FS 116 and FS32, as\npossibly variable in Table 3. An L dwarf companion has been\nfound for the UKIRT standard FS 129 (M dwarf LHS 2397a,\nFreed, Close & Siegler (2003)), but this should not lead to\ndetectable variability in the near-infrared.\nOmitting S705-D, the average uncertainty of the mag-\n\n6\n\nnitudes listed in Table 3 is 0.m 012 at J, and 0.m 011 at H and\nK. These errors do not include systematic effects, and we\nexplore these further below, through comparison with other\npublished work.\n\n6.1\n\nCOMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA\nDatasets\n\nIn this section we compare our measured MKO JHK\nmagnitudes with those measured for stars in common\nby: Hawarden et al. (2001) and the earlier UKIRT-system\nmeasurements by Casali & Hawarden (1992); Hunt et al.\n(1998) using the ARNICA camera with similar filters to\nthe UKIRT-system set; the LCO (NICMOS) system from\nPersson et al. (1998); the 2MASS atlas; and preliminary\nMKO-system data from UKIRT's Wide Field Camera, WFCAM. As we are looking for small effects, for the purpose\nof these comparisons we restrict each dataset to values with\nuncertainty < 0.m 025.\n\n\f10\n\nS. K. Leggett et al.\nTable 4.

To do this, we plotted the differences between the MKO data presented here\nand the six datasets listed above (as \u03b4J, \u03b4H and \u03b4K), as a\nfunction of the MKO colours J \u2212 K and H \u2212 K. In \u00a76.3 we\nshow that there are indications of non-linearity effects for\nstars brighter than 11th magnitude at J and 10.m 5 at H and\nK; hence to derive the colour transformations we used only\nstars fainter than these limits.\nFigure 2 shows \u03b4J and \u03b4K as a function of J \u2212 K,\nand Figure 3 shows \u03b4H and \u03b4K as a function of H \u2212 K.\nThe Hunt et al. (1998) data span a small range in colour\nand are not shown in the figures. The Casali & Hawarden\n(1992) UKIRT dataset did not span a large colour range,\nand the existing data showed close agreement with the later\nHawarden et al. (2001) data, as expected due to their use\nof the same filters. These two UKIRT-system datasets are\nshown together in one row in Figures 2 and 3. We adopt the\nsame colour transformation for the two datasets, derived\nfrom the more accurate Hawarden et al. (2001) results.\nIn the 2MASS rows in Figures 2 and 3 we also show differences derived from synthetic magnitudes by Hewett et al.\n(2006). Hewett et al. determined JHK MKO- and 2MASSsystem magnitudes from the Bruzual-Persson-Gunn-Stryker\nSpectral Atlas2 and additional M dwarf spectra taken from\nthe literature, for a study of the UKIDSS photometric system. The authors find that colour transformations between\n2MASS and MKO are a function of stellar luminosity class,\nand this can also be seen in Figures 2 and 3. Red dwarfs and\ngiants with the same J \u2212K or H \u2212K colour can differ in J or\n\n2\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/bpgs.html\n\ncolour\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 K2MASS\nJ \u2212 K2MASS\nH \u2212 K2MASS\nH \u2212 K2MASS\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 KLCO\nJ \u2212 KLCO\nH \u2212 KLCO\nH \u2212 KLCO\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nH \u2212 KMKO\nJ \u2212 KUKIRT\nJ \u2212 KUKIRT\nH \u2212 KUKIRT\nH \u2212 KUKIRT\n\nK by 0.m 05, between the two systems. Examining the spectra\nof an M2V and an M3III star, both with H \u2212K \u223c 0.3, shows\nthat the wider 2MASS J filter detects the water bands in the\ndwarf spectrum, and the redder MKO K filter is sensitive\nto the strong CO absorption in the red giant (see the filter\nbandpasses in Figure 1). The H filters sample similar spectral features, and the offset seen in \u03b4H in Figure 3 is simply\na difference in zeropoint. However, it must be borne in mind\nthat for astronomical objects with very structured spectral\nenergy distributions, such as T dwarfs, magnitudes can be\nsystem-dependent at the several-tenths of a magnitude level\n(Stephens & Leggett 2004).\nWFCAM on UKIRT contains MKO-system filters and\ntherefore there should be no colour dependency between the\nWFCAM and UFTI magnitudes presented here. Figure 3\nshows that \u03b4H and \u03b4K are consistent with no colour term,\nbut there is a suggestion of a colour dependency at J in Figure 2. The relationship is heavily weighted by the reddest\nstar and the slope is probably spurious. This will be investigated further as more WFCAM data are obtained and the\nWFCAM photometric response better understood.\nTable 4 gives colour tranformations between MKO and\nthe 2MASS, LCO and UKIRT systems, where\n\u03b4mag = A \u00b1 errorA + (B \u00b1 errorB \u2217 colour)\nDifferences in colours can be calculated from the differences\nin magnitudes. The LCO transformation should be treated\ncautiously as it is not well determined (see Figures 2 and\n3). Also, as described above, a single transformation cannot\ndescribe the 2MASS to MKO relationship to better than\n\u223c5% due to the intrinsic dependency on luminosity class.\nAll the photometric systems considered here are Vegabased, where Vega is defined to have zero magnitude in J,\nH and K.

(1982), who adopt Vega to be zero\nin all bands. 2MASS used LCO and UKIRT calibrators to\ncalibrate their fields. Thus, the linear fits shown in Figures 2 and 3 should go through (0,0). Table 4 (columns\n2 and 3) shows that LCO J and H have a small \u223c0.m 02\noffset, significant at the 4\u20137 \u03c3 level (as also seen in the\nUKIRT comparison by Hawarden et al. (2001)); 2MASS H\nand UKIRT JHK have smaller 0.m 010\u20130.m 015 offsets significant at the 3 \u03c3 level. These may reflect small drifts introduced into the systems' zeropoints with each step away\nfrom the initial, bright, Elias et al. (1982) reference standards (for example the MKO dataset presented here is\nlinked to the UKIRT Hawarden et al. (2001) dataset which\nis linked to the Casali & Hawarden (1992) dataset, which\nused Elias et al. (1982) standards).\n\n11\n\nData Comparison and Non-Linearity Effects\n\u03b4mag as a function of brightness\n\nHaving derived the colour transformations between systems,\nwe can now compare our results with other published values. To do this, we have applied the colour transformations\nderived above to each dataset, and calculated the difference\nin magnitudes. Due to the fact that our monotonic transformation does not take luminosity class into account, and\nhence may introduce an error for redder stars, the primary\ncomparison sample consists of stars with J \u2212 K < 0.7, as\nwell as uncertainties in magnitudes < 0.m 025. Red and blue\nstars are differentiated by symbols in Figures 4 and 5, which\nplot \u03b4mag as a function of magMKO for the ARNICA, LCO,\n2MASS, UKIRT and WFCAM samples. The WFCAM comparisons are plotted both with the colour terms suggested\nin Figures 2 and 3 applied, and with no colour term applied.\nThe clearest trends in Figures 4 and 5 are seen in the\nUKIRT \u2212 2MASS and UKIRT \u2212 MKO comparisons. The\n\n\f12\n\nS. K. Leggett et al.\n\nUKIRT \u2212 MKO correlation is such that brighter stars are\nfainter in the UKIRT system or brighter in the MKO system.\nDue to the opposite senses of the non-linearity behaviours\nof the cameras used for the UKIRT and MKO datasets, this\ncould point to a problem with either dataset, or both. In fact,\nthe unusual UFTI response is such that it exaggerates any\nnon-linearity in any of the comparison datasets, if any nonlinearity remains in the UFTI data. The comparisons with\n2MASS for the UKIRT Hawarden et al. data and the MKO\ndata presented here (bottom two rows in Figure 4) suggest\na correlation with the UKIRT data, and a less significant\ncorrelation with the MKO data (linear regression t-statistics\nimply the slopes are significant at the 4, 2 and 5 \u03c3 level at\nJ, H and K respectively for the UKIRT comparison, and 2,\n4 and 0 \u03c3 for the data presened here).\nThese observed trends spurred an investigation of\nnon-linearity effects in the MKO, UKIRT, WFCAM\nand 2MASS datasets. Large scatter or small magnitude\nrange in the samples considered here make the comparison to the Casali & Hawarden (1992); Hunt et al. (1998);\nPersson et al. (1998) data inconclusive.\n\n6.3.2\n\nApplied linearity corrections\n\nThe 2MASS data does not have a linearity correction applied\nas such, but all raw data are inspected and for any data\nwith signal at the level of 1% deviation from linearity, the\nfirst read of the image was used as opposed to the two-read\nimage (R. Cutri private communication). As the \"Read2 Read1\" exposure saturation threshold is around Ks = 8.0,\nthe K > 9 stars studied here should be safely in the linear\nregime for the 2MASS data, given the option of using the\nfirst-read data only.\nThe linearity response of the WFCAM detectors appears to be flat to 1% over a large range in counts (Hodgkin,\nprivate communication). However stars 11th magnitude and\nbrighter will have peak pixels approaching saturation, and\naperture photometry on such stars will be too faint by\nm\n>\n\u223c 0. 02. No trends are seen with brightness for the WFCAM data shown in Figure 5, suggesting that, at least for\nthis fainter subset of our sample, the WFCAM and MKO\ndata are linear.\nWe re-reduced the UKIRT and MKO data, taken with\nthe IRCAM and UFTI cameras respectively, exploring how\nchanges in the linearity correction affect the data. Doubling\nthe correction applied resulted in a 6 0.m 01 change in the\nfinal result. This is due both to the small size of the correction, and also to our way of reducing both the IRCAM\nand UFTI data in a relative sense, deriving an average zeropoint for each night's set of stars. However problems with\nthe linearity correction may still exist.\n\n6.3.3\n\nErrors in the applied linearity corrections\n\nPersson et al. (1998) point out that it is easy to underestimate non-linearity effects for very bright stars, with short\nexposure times, when using double-read mode. Both reads\nof the pair may be further up the non-linear curve than realised.\nWe can estimate the size of this effect for the data presented here and by Hawarden et al. (2001) by assuming that\n\nthe correction to each individual read is the same as that\nderived experimentally for the double-read mode. If the exposure time is equal to the read time, then the first read will\nhave counts \u223chalf those of the second read. In this case, for\nUFTI, if the second read is say 10000 DN, then applying the\nlinearity correction to each read instead of the difference of\nthe reads, leads to a signal difference of 6.1% for this pixel,\nwhere the true value is lower. If the exposure time is twice\nthe read time, so that the first read is \u223cone-third of the second, and the second read is 9000 DN, then the difference is\n3.6% for that pixel. The same calculations for IRCAM also\nproduce a \u223c4% effect, although here the true signal level is\nhigher.\nThe effect on the aperture photometry is smaller than\nthis; on a night with UKIRT's typical 0.\u2032\u2032 7 seeing, around\none-third of the total flux would arise from pixels with\ncounts within a factor of two of the maximum. Hence a 1\u20132%\neffect is likely for stars observed with exposure times 1\u20132\u00d7\nthe read time, or 9th\u201311th magnitude stars for the MKO\n(UFTI) and UKIRT (IRCAM) samples, in average to good\nseeing, at J, H and K. For stars fainter than 11th magnitude, the exposure time is >3\u20135\u00d7 the read time, and the\neffect on the aperture photometry is calculated to be 60.5%.\nThis means that the UKIRT to MKO comparisons in Figures 4 and 5 would show a \u223c0.m 04 effect for bright stars, and\nthe 2MASS comparisons would show a 0.m 02 effect (assuming\nthe 2MASS data are linear), as is in fact seen.\nThe combination of exposure times and filters used for\nthis work, and by Hawarden et al., led to counts on the\nstandard star being larger at J than at H and K, for both\ndatasets. Hence the error in the non-linearity correction is\nsignificant at fainter values of J than of H and K. Linear\nregression to the UKIRT \u2212 MKO plots shown in Figure 5\ngives correlation coefficients and t-statistic values of 0.7 and\n8, 0.7 and 9 and 0.5 and 5, for J, H and K, respectively,\nwhen the entire sample is considered. Excluding stars with\nJ <11 and H, K < 10.5 reduces these to insignificant values\nof 0.4 and 2.5, 0.4 and 3 and 0.2 and 1.5.\nGiven the stronger correlation between the 2MASS and\nUKIRT values than between 2MASS and MKO (Figure 4),\nand the larger pixels in IRCAM than UFTI (0.\u2032\u2032 28 cf. 0.\u2032\u2032 09),\nits likely that more of the non-linearity error lies in the earlier Hawarden et al. (2001) data than in the data presented\nhere. In any case, the systematic effect on the data presented\nhere is small: +0.m 005 \u2013 +0.m 020 for the 25 stars with J <11\nor H, K < 10.5. For the 90 fainter stars in the sample, the\nerror is a factor of two, or more, less than the measurement\nerror, and hence insignificant.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented JHK magnitudes for 115 stars in the\nbrightness range of 10\u201315th magnitude. The photometry is\nin the widely adopted MKO photometric system, which uses\nwell-defined filters matched to the atmospheric windows.\nThe internal accuracy is on average 0.m 011, with the stars\nbeing observed typically over 4 nights. The results presented\nhere should be used in preference to those of Hawarden et al.\n(2001) if observations are being made in the MKO system,\nas the filters, and hence the photometric systems, are significantly different from the UKIRT system.\n\n\fJHK Observations of Standard Stars\nWe present colour transformations between the MKO\nand the 2MASS, LCO and UKIRT photometric systems.\nHowever these transformations can be luminosity-class dependent at the 5% level for redder stars with strong absorption bands. For very accurate transformations between systems, the exact spectral type needs to be known and transformations calculated and applied as a function of type (or\nthe stars should be observed in the required system).\nWe find that the difference between the JHK magnitudes presented here and those presented previously by\nHawarden et al. (2001) shows a dependence on brightness.\nWe explain this in terms of an under-estimate of the linearity correction for stars with J < 11 and H,K < 10.5, such\nthat the photometry presented here and by Hawarden et al.\nm\nis affected by <0.\n\u223c 02. The effect is likely to be more significant in the results of Hawarden et al. than in the present\nresults: this is supported by comparisons with 2MASS data.\nThere are 84 stars in the sample presented here that\nhave 11 < J < 15 and 10.5 < H,K < 15, are not suspected\nto be variable, and have magnitudes with an estimated error\n6 0.m 027; 79 of these have an error of 6 0.m 020. We recommend that these be adopted as primary standards for the\nMKO near-infrared (JHK) photometric system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe United Kingdom Infrared Telescope is operated by\nthe Joint Astronomy Centre on behalf of the U.K. Particle\nPhysics and Astronomy Research Council.
