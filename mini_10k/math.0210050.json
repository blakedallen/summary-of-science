We will see that this translates into an 'action of\nthe center' which has many applications.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is known [1],[2] that the problem of determining the conditions on conjugacy classes \u01001 , . . . , \u0100s in SU(n) so that these lift to elements A1 , . . . , As \u2208\nSU(n) with A1 A2 , . . . As = 1 is controlled by Quantum Schubert calculus of\nGrassmannians. Teleman and Woodward have in a recent preprint generalized this to an arbitrary simple, simply connected compact group K. If G is\nthe complex simple subgroup (whose real points are K), then the role played\nby the Grassmanians is replaced by the homogeneous spaces G/P for P a\nmaximal parabolic subgroup.\nIn the case of SU(n) (and similarly for K) there is a natural 'action'\nof center of K on the representation theory side, namely if c1 , . . . , cs are\n1\n\n\fcentral elements with c1 c2 . . . cs = 1, then these act on the set of conjugacy\nclasses \u01001 , . . . , \u0100s in SU(n) lift-able to elements A1 , . . . , As \u2208 SU(n) with\nA1 A2 . . . As = 1, the action being just multiplying \u0100i by ci . This action is\nwell defined on the level of conjugacy classes because the ci are central.\nThis suggests a natural transformation property of Gromov-Witten numbers of the Grassmannians under the action of the center. This property was\nproved in [1] as a consequence of the known description of Quantum Schubert\ncalculus [3].\nThe aim of this article is twofold. The first aim is to prove the transformation formulas geometrically and in complete generality (for any simple\nsimply connected complex Lie group). The second is to show that these formulas determine quantum Schubert calculus in the case of Grassmannians\n(Bertram's Schubert Calculus). We also give a strengthening in the case of\nGrassmannians of a theorem of Fulton and Woodward on the lowest power\nof q appearing in a (quantum)product of Schubert classes in G/P where P\nis a maximal parabolic subgroup.\nLet us now describe these transformation formulas. See section 1 for the\nnotation. Let G be a simple, semi-simple complex algebraic group. We first\nconstruct a map \u03c6 : C \u2192 W where C is the center of G and W the Weyl\ngroup. Let Z be a homology class of G/P where P is an arbitrary parabolic\nsubgroup (not necessarily maximal). Let c1 , . . . , cs be central elements with\nproduct =1. Let w1 , . . . , ws be elements of (a suitable right quotient of W ),\nthen the transformation formulas take the shape\n< X\u03c6(c1 )w1 , . . . , X\u03c6(cs )ws >Z \u2032 =< Xw1 , . . . , Xws >Z\nwhere Z \u2032 is a homology class determined by Z and the rest of the data.\nIt happens that in some cases, Z \u2032 is a simpler homology class than Z, for\ninstance Z \u2032 could be zero, when Z is not. This allows for reducing the quantum terms to the classical ones. This program works in the Grassmannian\ncase (and Flag manifold case, but we have not included the details here).\nThere exist simple simply connected groups with trivial center. In this\ncase the transformation formulas do not give any information. Maybe there\nis an extension of these transformation formulas to the non miniscule case.\nSuch an extension is not apparent from the representation theory side.\nThe argument for Grassmannians may go through in the miniscule case.\nWe will return to this question in a later paper.\nOne final comment is that even in the classical case of cohomology the\n2\n\n\ftransformation formulas give vanishing statements. For example if Z' turns\nout to be negative and Z = 0, then we get a vanishing statement of certain\nintersection numbers.\nMany of the results in this paper are new proofs of older results using\nmethods which seem both natural and elementary (to the author). It is\nperhaps worth pointing out what is essentially new in this paper - the transformation formulas in the (usual) partial flag manifold case, the exact determination of the lowest order terms in the quantum products of two Schubert\ncycles in (usual) Grassmannians, the natural extension of the transformation\nformulas to all groups. It should be noted that the quantum schubert calculus of G/B or of G/P is not known except (when G = SL(n)), and the\nrelations coming from the center might be the first general explicit formula.\nA. Buch [6] has recently given new proofs of Bertram's Quantum Schubert\nCalculus, using very different methods.\nWe thank Aaron Bertram, Patrick Brosnan, Anders Buch, William Fulton, Misha Kapovich, Madhav Nori and Christopher Woodward for several\nhelpful conversations and encouragement.\n\n2\n\nSome representation theory\n\n2.1\n\nNotation\n\nWe review some basic representation theory in this section. For proofs refer\nto Bourbaki[5].\nLet G be a simple simply connected complex algebraic group. Let g be\nits lie algebra. Let B be a Borel subgroup, T \u2282 B a maximal torus and let\nM\ng=h\ng\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the \u03b1's belong to the subset of roots R in h\u2217 . The set R is partitioned into the set of positive roots R+ and negative roots R\u2212 , and the lie\nalgebra of B is\nM\nb=h\ng\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\n\nwith the \u03b1\u2032 s in R+ . Also define \u2206 to be the set of simple roots.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Weyl group W is defined to be N(T )/T , where N(T ) is the normalizer\nof T which acts on h and h\u2217 . If \u03b1 is a root, we have elements w\u03b1 \u2208 W , H\u03b1 \u2208 h,\nso that w\u03b1 acts on h\u2217 by\nw\u03b1 (\u03b2) = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2(H\u03b1 )\u03b1.\nand this map preserves the roots, is a reflection and takes \u03b1 to \u2212\u03b1.\nThe action of w\u03b1 on g is given by\nw\u03b1 (H) = H \u2212 \u03b1(H)H\u03b1.\nIt is also known that w\u03b1 's generate W .\nThe affine Weyl group Waf f is defined to be the set of automorphisms of\nh generated by W and translations by H\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 R.\n\n2.2\n\nConjugacy classes\n\nLet K be a maximalN(connected) compact subgroup of G. If k is the lie\nalgebra of K, then k R C = g. Let TK = T \u2229 K be the maximal torus in\nK, with lie algebra ih. The following are standard facts:\n1. TK \u2192 K induces a surjection on conjugacy classes.\n2. x1 , x2 \u2208 TK are conjugate in K if and only if there exists w \u2208 W with\nAd(w)x1 = x2 .\n3. let Exp : hK \u2192 TK be the exponential map from the lie algebra of TK\nto TK . The kernel of this map is \u0393(T ) = Z\u2212span {2\u03c0iH\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 R}.\nThis follows from simply connectedness of G.\n4. If t1 , t2 \u2208 hK , then Exp(t1 ) and Exp(t2 ) are conjugate in K if and only\nif there exists w \u2208 W with\nw(t1 ) \u2212 t2 \u2208 \u0393(T ).\nPutting this all together, if we let hR be the R- span of {H\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 R},\nthen the map hR \u2192 TK by t 7\u2192Exp(2\u03c0it) induces an isomorphism\nhR /Waf f \u2192 conjugacy classes in K.\n\n4\n\n\f2.3\n\nFundamental Chamber and Center\n\nLet L\u03b1,k = {x \u2208 hR : \u03b1(x) = k}. The affine Weyl group is then the group\ngenerated by reflections in L\u03b1,k for k \u2208 Z. Finally let \u1fb0 be the highest weight\nfor the adjoint representation.\nTheorem 1. (Fundamental chamber for affine Weyl group) Let C = {x \u2208\nhR : \u03b1(x) > 0 for \u03b1 \u2208 R+ , \u1fb0(x) < 1}.\n1. C is a connected component of hR \u2212 \u222a\u03b1\u2208R,k\u2208Z L\u03b1,k .\n2. If C \u2032 is any other component, there is a unique w \u2208 Waf f with w(C) =\nC \u2032.\n3. Let C\u0304 be the closure of C, then the composite C\u0304 \u2192 hR /Waf f \u2192 conjugacy classes in K is, a homeomorphism.\nWe now give the description of the center.\nP For this, Let S = {x \u2208 C\u0304 :\n\u03b1(x) \u2208 Z, for all \u03b1 \u2208 R}. Finally, write \u1fb0 = \u03b1\u2208\u2206 n\u03b1 \u03b1. where \u2206 is the set\nof simple positive roots.\nTheorem 2.\n\n1. The map C\u0304 \u2192 conjugacy classes in G, takes S to center(K).\n\n2. Define x\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 by the formula \u03b2(x\u03b1 ) = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206. Then,\nS = {0} \u222a {x\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, n\u03b1 = 1}\n\n2.4\n\nA map from Center to the Weyl group\n\nIf c is in center(G) (=center(K)), which corresponds to x\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 then we\ncan consider the set C \u2032 = C \u2212 x\u03b1 . It is easy to see that this is a connected\ncomponent of hR \u2212 \u222a\u03b1\u2208R,k\u2208Z L\u03b1,k . Therefore we have\nC \u2212 x\u03b1 = wc\u22121 (C) + t\u03b1\nwhere wc \u2208 W and t\u03b1 \u2208 Z - span of H\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 R.\nDefine y(x) = wc (x \u2212 x\u03b1 \u2212 t\u03b1 ). Then we have the equation\nx \u2212 x\u03b1 = wc\u22121 (y(x)) + t\u03b1\nand also that x \u2208 C =\u21d2 y(x) \u2208 C. Hence, x \u2208 C\u0304 =\u21d2 y(x) \u2208 C\u0304. Now\nput x = x\u03b1 . Then we get,\n5\n\n\fwc\u22121 (y(x) = \u2212t\u03b1 , this gives y(x) is zero in hR /Waf f and by theorem 1 in\nsection 2.3, we get y(x) = 0 so t\u03b1 = 0.\nWe therefore have:\nTheorem 3. (Map from center to Weyl group) Let c be in center(K), let\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 be so that exp(2\u03c0ix\u03b1 ) = c. Then there exists a wc \u2208 W so that the\nequation C \u2212 x\u03b1 = wc\u22121(C) holds. Furthermore the map Center(G)\u2192 W is\na injective homomorphism of groups.\nProof. The only part not proved is that c 7\u2192 wc is a homomorphism of groups.\nFor this, let c1 , c2 be central elements. Let x\u03b1 , x\u03b2 , x\u03b3 correspond to c1 , c2 and\nc1 c2 respectively. It is clear that x\u03b1 + x\u03b2 = x\u03b3 + t with t \u2208 Z - span of\nH\u03b4 , \u03b4 \u2208 R. hence\nC \u2212 x\u03b3 = C \u2212 x\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b2 + t\n= wc\u22121\n(C \u2212 x\u03b2 ) + (wc\u22121\n(x\u03b2 ) \u2212 x\u03b2 ) + t\n1\n1\n= wc\u22121\nwc\u22121\n(C) + t1 + t\n1\n2\nwhere t1 and t are in Z - span of H\u03b4 , \u03b4 \u2208 R. The proof is therefore\ncomplete.\nWe can describe the element wc more concretely, for this first note\n1. If x \u2208 C then y(x) \u2208 C.\n2. For \u03b2 \u2208 R, \u03b2 \u2208 R+ if and only if \u03b2(x) > 0 for any x \u2208 C.\n3. wc (\u03b2)(y(x)) = \u03b2(wc\u22121(y(x))) = \u03b2(x) \u2212 \u03b2(x\u03b1 ).\nwe therefore have the following description of wc .\nLemma 1. In the situation above\n1. If \u03b2(x\u03b1 ) = 0 then \u03b2 and wc (\u03b2) have the same 'sign' (simultaneously in\nR+ , or in R\u2212 ).\n2. If \u03b2(x\u03b1 ) = 1 then \u03b2 and wc (\u03b2) have opposite 'signs'.\n\n6\n\n\f2.5\n\nParabolics associated to Central Elements\n\nFix c1 , c2 belonging to center(G) with c1 c2 = 1.

Q2 = Ad(wc1 )(Q1 ). Or that \u03b3(x\u03b1 ) = 0 if and only if (wc1 (\u03b3))(x\u03b2 ) =\n0.\nProof. Follows from \u2212x\u03b1 = wc\u22121\n(x\u03b2 ).\n1\nLemma 3.

The first statement follows from\n(wc1 (\u03b3))(x\u03b2 ) = \u2212\u03b3(x\u03b1 ).\nThe transversality statement follows from the same equation (counting dimensions).\nCorollary 1. If g1 , g2 are general elements of G, the set (wc1 P1 g1 ) \u2229 (P2 g2 )\nis non empty.\nProof. If g1 = wc\u22121\n, g2 = 1, then this follows from the lemma above. Then\n1\napply standard intersection theory(local).\n7\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nAlgebraic Geometry preliminaries on G/B\nLine bundles on G/P and G/B\n\nLet P be a parabolic containing B. We then have a natural surjection G/B \u2192\nG/P . It is known this induces injections on the Picard Groups. Our goal\nhere is to recall the standard facts on describing all the line bundles on G/B\nand on which of these descend to G/P .\nLet W L = weight lattice of g. This is the subset of h\u2217 spanned by elements\n\u03c9 so that \u03c9(H\u03b1) \u2208 Z for all \u03b1 \u2208 R . It has a Z basis {\u03c9\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206} where\n\u03c9\u03b1 (H\u03b2 ) = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\nfor all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206.\nThere is a natural isomorphism \u03c8 : W L \u2192Pic(G/B). The map is defined\nas follows: for each \u03c9 \u2208 W L+ there exists a representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 GL(V )\nwith highest weight \u03c9. Let the highest weight vector be v \u2208 V . Then there\nis a map G/B \u2192 Orb(Cv) \u2282 P(V ) where Orb(Cv) is the orbit of the line\nCv. The map then takes \u03c9 to pull back of O(1) by the map above.\nThe subset W LP of weights that descend to line bundles on G/P are just\nthose elements\n\u03c9 which satisfy the property\nL\nif g\u03b1 g\u2212\u03b1 \u2282 p, then \u03c9(H\u03b1 ) = 0.\nThe second Homology group H2 (G/P, Z) can be naturally considered as\nthe dual Hom(W LP , Z) by Poincare duality. Note that the homology class\nof f\u2217 ([C]) where f : P1 \u2192 G/P corresponds to the map W LP \u2192 Z obtained\nby taking 'degree of the pullback bundle'.\nNext we describe the first Chern classes of the tangent bundles of G/B\nand G/P .\nP\n1.

First Chern class of TG/P : this is \u03c8( \u03b1\u2208R,g\u03b1 \u2282p \u03b1).\n\n3.2\n\nCell decomposition and cohomology of G/P\n\nLetL\nP \u2282 B be a parabolic subgroup. Let \u2206P be the set of roots \u03b1 such that\ng\u03b1 g\u2212\u03b1 \u2282 p. Let WP be the subgroup of the Weyl group generated by the\nreflections corresponding to elements of \u2206.\n\n8\n\n\fTheorem 4. (Bruhat decomposition:) G/P is a disjoint union of the sets\n\u039bw for w \u2208 W/WP where \u039bw is defined to be BwP \u2282 G/P . Let Xw be the\nclosure of \u039bw . The codimension of Xw is the cardinality of the set\n{\u03b1 \u2208 R : g\u03b1 6\u2282 p, w(\u03b1) 6\u2208 R+ } .\nProof. Standard, see [4].\nIt is known that the subvarieties Xw generate the cohomology (additively)\nof G/P .Finally recall the definition of 'relative position' [g1 , g2 ] of two elements g1 , g2 \u2208 G. We define w = [g1 , g2 ] to be the unique element of the\nWeyl group so that there exist b1 , b2 \u2208 B so that g1 = g2 b1 wb2 (Bruhat\ndecomposition).\nNote the following three properties:\n1. [g1 , g2 ] = [gg1 , gg2] for g1 , g2 \u2208 G.\n2. [g1 b, g2 ] = [g1 , g2 b] = [g1 , g2 ] for b \u2208 B.\n3. h \u2208 g\u039bw if and only if [h, g] = w.\nAnalogous definition of relative position can be made of [g1 , g2 ] where this\ntakes values in W/WP , g1 \u2208 G/P and g2 \u2208 G.\nWe need one final lemma which relates the codimensions of Xw and Xwc w\nwhere wc is an element of the Weyl group constructed out of a central element\nc as in the previous section\nLemma 4. Let c \u2208 center(G), w \u2208 W with representative x\u03b1 \u2208 C. Then\ncodim(Xwc w ) \u2212 codim(Xw ) is equal to\nX\nw\u03b2(x\u03b1 ).\n\u03b26\u2208\u2206\n\nProof. The quantity we are interested in is\n{\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : w(\u03b1) \u2208 R+ } \u2212 {\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : (wc w)(\u03b1) \u2208 R+ } .\nTo evaluate the second quantity(using lemma 1 of 2.4), divide into two\ncases namely\n{\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : w(\u03b1) \u2208 R+ , w\u03b2(x\u03b1) = 0}\n9\n\n\fand\n{\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : w(\u03b1) \u2208 R\u2212 , w\u03b2(x\u03b1 ) = \u22121} .\nTherefore the quantity we are interested in becomes\n{\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : w(\u03b1) \u2208 R+ , w\u03b2(x\u03b1) = 1} \u2212 {\u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206P : w(\u03b1) \u2208 R\u2212 , w\u03b2(x\u03b1 ) = \u22121} .\nand that is what is displayed in the statement of the lemma. Note that\nour hypotheses imply that if \u03b2 \u2208 R, then \u03b2(x\u03b1 ) is in the set {\u22121, 0, 1}.\n\n3.3\n\nSpace of maps and Gromov-Witten invariants\n\nLet X \u2208 H2 (G/B; Z).\nLet MX = space of maps f : P1 \u2192 G/B so that f\u2217 ([P1 ]) = X. It is known\nthat MX can be given the structure of a smooth quasi-projective variety of\ndimension dX where\ndX = c1 (TG/B ) \u2229 X + dim(G/B).\nOf central interest to us in this paper are Gromov-Witten invariants.\nRecall that we have fixed three points p1 , p2 , p3 on P1 (which we usually take\nto be 0, \u221e, 1).\nDefinition 1. Let Z \u2208 H2 (G/B; Z); w1 , w2, w3 \u2208 W . Then,\n< Xw1 , Xw2 , Xw3 >Z is defined to be the number of maps (0 if infinite)\nf \u2208 MZ so that f (pi ) \u2208 gi Xwi ; i = 1, 2, 3 where gi are 'general' points of G.\nNote that the invariant above is 0 unless\nX\nCodim(Xwi ) = c1 (TG/B ) \u2229 Z + dim(G/B).\n\n4\n\nThe transformation formula\n\nTheorem 5. Let Z \u2208 H2 (G/P ; Z); u1 , u2, u3 \u2208 W ,c1 , c2 \u2208 Center(G).\nThen,\n< Xu1 , Xu2 , Xu3 >Z =< Xwc1 u1 , Xwc2 u2 , Xu3 >Z \u2032 .\nwhere Z \u2032 as an element of Hom(W LP , Z) is given by\n10\n\n\f\u22121\nz \u2032 (\u03b3) = z(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3(u\u22121\n1 x1 \u2212 x1 ) \u2212 \u03b3(u2 x2 \u2212 w2 x2 ).\n\nProof. Let us first check that the codimension condition\nX\ncodim(Xui ) = c1 (TG/P ) \u2229 Z + dim(G/P ).\nfor the left hand side is the same as that for the RHS.\nRecall that if c \u2208 center(G), w \u2208 W with representative x\u03b1 \u2208 C. Then\ncodim(Xwc w ) \u2212 codim(Xw ) is equal to\nX\nw\u03b2(x\u03b1 ).\n\u03b2:g\u03b2 6\u2282p\n\nso we have to verify\nX\n\n(u1 \u03b2(x1 ) + u2 \u03b2(x2 ))\n\n\u03b2:g\u03b2 6\u2282p\n\nequals\n\u03b3(Z \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b3(Z)\nwhere\n\u03b3=\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03b2.\n\n\u03b2:g\u03b2 6\u2282p\n\nwhich has been proved before [3.2, lemma 4].\nTo start working towards the transformation formulas, fix u1 , u2, u3 \u2208 W ,\ng1 , g2 , g3 \u2208 G 'elements in general position'. And c1 , c2 central elements in G\nwith c1 c2 = 1 (as in section 2.5). Recall the notations of section 2.5.\nPick an element k \u2208 (P1 g1\u22121) \u2229 (wc2 P2 g2\u22121). There exists such a k because\nof corollary 1 in section 2.5. Consider the map\n\u03c6 : G/P \u2192 G/P given by left multiplication by k. Let f \u2208 MZ , we claim\nf (pi ) \u2208 gi Xwi ; i = 1, 2, 3 if and only if\nSetting g = \u03c6f, g(pi ) \u2208 kgi Xwi ; i = 1, 2, 3, this claim is obvious but we\nalso have k(g1 ) \u2208 P1 and kg2 \u2208 Ad(wc2 )P2 . So we might as well assume\ng1 \u2208 P1 and g2 \u2208 wc2 P2 .\nNow suppose f : P1 \u2192 G/P then , let s be the map P1 \u2192 G/P given by:\n(to simplify notation: let\n1. w1 and w2 denote wc1 and wc2 respectively.\n11\n\n\f2. x1 and x2 denote x\u03b1 and x\u03b2 respectively.\n3. for t \u2208 T , z \u2208 C, let z t denote exp(ln(z)t) (with the indeterminacies.)\ns(z) = z x1 f (z).\nNote that the indeterminacy of s is always central so as a map to G/P it\nis well defined (on the complement of {0, 1, \u221e}). And we can extend this to\nthe whole of P1 , because all the functions involved are of bounded growth.\nWe have to study the effect on the degrees and also on the 'positions' of\ns(1), s(1), s(\u221e).\nPosition of s(0):\nWe have assumed that g1 is in P1 . And P1 = Q1 B. So let g1 = q1 b. We\nclaim that the element\ng1\u2032 = q1 w1\u22121 is well defined in G/P (independent of choices). we need that\nif q1\u2032 = q1 b, thenq1 w1\u22121 and q1 bw1\u22121 give the same point in G/P . That is,\nw1 bw1\u22121 \u2208 B if b \u2208 Q1 \u2229 B. But this is clear from lemma 1 of section 2.4.\nWe claim: [s(0), g1\u2032 ] = w1 [f (0), g1]. That is [s(0), q1 w1\u22121 ] = w1\u22121 [f (0), q1 ].\nLet f (0) = q1 b1 wb2 and f = n(z)f (0) where n(0) = 1. we therefore need\nto compare\n[limz\u21920 z x1 n(z)f (0), g1\u2032 ] with\n[f (0), g1].\nOr,if we set h = q1\u22121 f (0),\nwe want to relate\n[limz\u21920 (Ad(q1\u22121 )z x1 )(Ad(q1\u22121)n(z))h, w \u22121 ]\nwith [h, 1]\nIt is easy to see that Ad(q1\u22121 )z x1 = z x1 . Setting r(z) = Ad(q1\u22121 )n(z), we\nwant then to relate\n[limz\u21920 z x1 r(z)h, w \u22121 ] with [h, 1] where r(0) = 1. For this we need\nLemma 5. If d(z) is a holomorphic map to G, with d(0) \u2208 B then k =\nlimz\u21920 Ad(z x1 )d(z) exists with w1 kw1\u22121 \u2208 B.\nProof. G is generated by the one parameter groups G\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 R and T.\nThese groups are isomorphic to C, and with an action (Ad) of the torus with\nAd(t)u = \u03b1(t)u.\nIf d(z) \u2208 G\u03b1 = C given by d(z) = z m then\nAd(z x1 )d(z) = z \u03b1(x1 ) d(z). Hence to verify the lemma we need\n12\n\n\f1. If \u03b1 \u2208 R+ then \u03b1(x1 ) = 0 implies w1 (\u03b1) is a positive root, which is\nknown. If \u03b1(x1 ) = 1 then k = 1.\n2. If \u03b1 \u2208 R\u2212 with \u03b1(x1 ) = 0 then clearly k = 1.\n3. If \u03b1 \u2208 R\u2212 with \u03b1(x1 ) = \u22121 then clearly k exists and w1 (\u03b1) is positive.\n\nPosition of s(\u221e), s(1): Note that we have chosen p2 = \u221e in order to\nsimplify the notation.\nNote that g2 \u2208 w2 P2 . Consider the map \u03c8 : G/P \u2192 G/P by left multiplication by w2\u22121 . Write g2 = w2 q2 b for q2 \u2208 Q2 and b \u2208 B. Let g2\u2032 = w2 q2 w2\u22121 b\nas before the G/P class of g2\u2032 is well-defined. It is then easy to see that\nw2 [f (\u221e), g2] = [s(\u221e), g2\u2032 ]. For this is is enough to notice that z x1 = ( 1z )w2 x2 .\nFinally let g3\u2032 = g3 it is clear that [s(1), g3\u2032 ] = [f (1), g3].\nNext we have to compute the homology class s\u2217 ([P1 ]).\nTheorem 6. If z is the element in Hom(W LP , P1 ) corresponding to f then\nthe element z \u2032 corresponding to s is the element\n\u22121\nz \u2032 (\u03b3) = z(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3(u\u22121\n1 x1 \u2212 x1 ) \u2212 \u03b3(u2 x2 \u2212 w2 x2 )\n\n= z(\u03b3) \u2212 u1 \u03b3(x1 ) \u2212 u2\u03b3(x2 ).\nProof. It is enough to prove this in the case \u03b3 positive and integral. Let L\nbe the line bundle on G/P corresponding to \u03b3. We construct the line bundle\ncorresponding to \u03b3 in a different (equivalent) manner first. First extend \u03b3 to\na map \u0393 : P \u2192 C\u2217 . then construct the total space of L as G \u00d7 C/R where R\nis the equivalence relation (g, v) = (gp, \u0393(p)v) for p \u2208 P .\nf, s give two line bundles Lf = f \u2217 (L), Ls = s\u2217 (L). At a point other than\n0,\u221e, construct the map \u03c8 : Lf \u2192 Ls , by (f \u0306(z), 1) to (z x1 f \u0306(z), \u0393(z x1 )) where\nf \u0306(z) is a local lifting of f to a map \u2192 G, and where the same determination\nof z x1 in both z x1 f \u0306(z) and in \u0393(z x1 ).\nIt is immediate to see that \u03c8 is an isomorphism of bundles outside of\n{0, \u221e}. Let us analyze this map first at z = 0. Lift f to a map f \u0306 to G.\nThen (f \u0306, 1) is a local section of f and this is mapped by \u03c8 to (z x1 f \u0306, \u0393(z x1 ))\na meromorphic section of Ls . To complete the analysis we have to display a\ngenerating section of Ls . Let f \u0306(z) = q1 b(z)u1 p where (recall g1 = q1 b1 p \u2208 P )\nb(0) \u2208 B. Now z x1 q1 = q1 z x1 and z x1 b(z)z \u2212x1 is holomorphic at z = 0.\n13\n\n\fWe therefore find that (z x1 q1 b(z)z \u2212x1 u1 p1 , 1) is a holomorphic section of Ls .\nTherefore the contribution at z = 0 to deg(Ls ) \u2212 deg(Lf ) is \u03b3(x1 \u2212 u\u22121\n1 x1 ).\nThe calculation at \u221e is similar and we arrive at the equation in the\nstatement.\nNow consider the map which takes a map f : P1 \u2192 G/P to the map s as\nabove. We have seen that if we choose generic gi to compute the left hand\nside, then the s\u2032 s correspond to the right hand side computed with respect\nto gi\u2032 . The gi\u2032 depend only on the gi and the central elements chosen. So\ncomputed w.r.t gi\u2032 the right handside is a finite number and the codimension\ncomputation therefore gives us an inequality.\n< Xu1 , Xu2 , Xu3 >Z \u2264< Xwc1 u1 , Xwc2 u2 , Xu3 >Z \u2032 .\nNow apply the reasoning again, this time with c2 , c1 , to get the other\ninequality.\nCorollary 2.

Let us do the case s = 3, the general case is similiar. We write\ndown the transformation formulas (as in the theorem) for c1 , c1 \u22121 , and then\ntransform this on the second and third 'variables' by c1 c2 , (c1 c2 )\u22121 , it is clear\nthat (c1 c2 )\u22121 = c3 . We just have to verify that the formula for Z \u2032 is the one\nabove. We leave this to the reader.\n\n5\n\nReformulation\n\nLet P be a standard parabolic, \u03a3 the set {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 : g\u2212\u03b1 6\u2282 p}.

We denote the cohomology class of this subvariety by \u03c3(I).\nThe codimension of this subvariety is the number of pairs (j, i) with j \u2208\n/ I\nand i \u2208 I and j > i.\nThe Gromov-Witten invariants in the Grassmannian case also have an\ninterpretation in terms of vector bundles on P1 . Let V = On be a vector\nbundle on P1 . We have a universal sequence of vector bundles on Gr(r, n)\n0 \u2192 S \u2192 On \u2192 Q \u2192 0\nwhere S is the universal subbundle of rank r and Q the quotient. It is now\neasy to verify that degree d maps \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 Gr(r, n) are in 1-1 correspondence\nwith subbundles of rank r and degree \u2212d of V by pulling back the universal\nsequence via the map \u03c1. Also, the image of point pi under this map is exactly\nthe fiber of this subbundle at pi . It is useful to fix an n-dimensional space T\nand identify all fibers of the bundle V with T . To obtain the other direction\nof this correspondence note that subbundles S correspond to a family of r\ndimensional subspaces of T(over P1 ).\nThe number defined above, therefore counts the number (zero if infinite)\nof subbundles E of V of degree \u2212d and rank r such that the fiber Epi as a\nsubset of T lies in the Schubert variety \u03a9I (Fp\u2022i ).\n\n6.1\n\nThe Transformation property\n\nTheorem 7. Let I1 , . . . , Is be subsets of {1, ..n} of cardinality r each. Let\nn1 , . . . , ns be natural numbers summing to n. Define Ji = Ii \u2212ni mod n. That\nis subtract ni from the numbers in Ii and reduce them mod n and replace all\n0's by n. define di = number of elements in Ii which are less than or equal\nto ni .\nthen\n< \u03c3(I1 ), . . . , \u03c3(Is ) >d =< \u03c3(J1 ), . . . , \u03c3(Js ) >d+r\u2212P di .\nRemark: This property has been noted and proved in [1] as a consequence\nof the Schubert Calculus established in [3]. The proof here is geometric and\nindependent of [3]. It is essentially the same proof as that of the transformation formulas of the previous section.\n16\n\n\fProof. First we verify that the codimension conditions on both sides are the\nsame. That is:\ns\nX\ncodim(\u03c3(Ii )) = nd + r(n \u2212 r).\ni=1\n\nis same as the condition\ns\nX\n\ncodim(\u03c3(Ji )) = n(d + r \u2212\n\nX\n\ndi ) + r(n \u2212 r).\n\ni=1\n\nThis follows easily from the observation:\ncodim(\u03c3(Ji )) = codim(\u03c3(Ii )) + (ni \u2212 di )r \u2212 (n \u2212 r)di .\nNow fix s general flags on V = C n : Fp\u2022i , i = 1, ..s, as well as s points\np1 , . . . , ps on P1 . Then < \u03c3(I1 ), . . . , \u03c3(Is ) >N\nd is the number of subbundles\n(zero if infinite) of subbundles E of V = V C O of degree \u2212d and rank r\nsuch that the fiber Epi as a subset of C n lies in the Schubert variety \u03a9Ii (Fp\u2022i ).\nLet Vi = Fpnii . We have from genericity of the flags, an equality\nM\nVi 7\u2192 C n .\nWe define a new bundle on P1 as follows (q is a new point on P1 ).\nL N\nDefinition 4. V\u2032 = (Vi O(pi \u2212 q)).\nNote that we are given an isomorphism V \u2192 V\u2032 over the open set U =\nP \u2212 {p1 , . . . , ps , q} and also that V\u2032 is isomorphic to On . From the theorem\nbelow we know that we have a one-one correspondence between subbundles\nE of V and subbundles E\u2032 of V\u2032 . We also have induced flags Fp\u2032\u2022i on the fibers\nof V\u2032 at the points pi , so that if fiber Epi is in the Schubert variety \u03a9Ii (Fp\u2022i ),\nthen the fiber E\u2032 pi is in the Schubert variety \u03a9Ji (Fp\u2032\u2022i ). The theorem below\nalso tellsPus that in this correspondence degree of E\u2032 is equal to degree of\nE \u2212 r + di .\nThis finishes the proof but we have to deal with genericity questions.\nA more refined approach can directly show that the induced flags on V\u2032 are\ngeneric too. But we wish to avoid this line of argument here. Instead we note\nthat this argument proves that (with the codimension computation) that\n1\n\n< \u03c3(I1 ), . . . , \u03c3(Is ) >d \u2264< \u03c3(J1 ), . . . , \u03c3(Js ) >d+r\u2212P di .\n17\n\n\fWe could then reverse this construction (or perform in many times) to get\nthe other inequality. This proves that there are no intersections at ' infinity'\nand also transversality without invoking the theory of Quot schemes.\nTheorem 8. (Local theory) Let C be a smooth curve p a point on it, t a\nuniformising parameter at p. Let V be a vector bundle on C, V = fiber Vp .\nAlso suppose that we are given a complete flag on V : V1 \u2282 V2 \u2282 * * * \u2282\nVn = V . Define V\u2032k = { meromorphic sections s of V which are holomorphic\nsections of V outside of p and such that ts extends to give a section of V near\np with fiber at p in Vk }.\n1. V \u2282 V\u2032k with quotient supported at p of dimension k.\n2. There is a one-one correspondence between subbundles E of V and subE\u2032\nbundles E\u2032k of V\u2032k . In this correspondence the quotient Ek is supported\nat p and has dimension dim(Ep \u2229 Vk ).\n3. We have a sequence of inclusions\nt(V\u2032k ) \u2282 t(V\u2032k+1 ) . . . V \u2282 V\u20321 * * * \u2282 V\u2032k .\nwhich gives a complete flag on the fiber (V\u2032k )p .\n4. In the correspondence on the subbundles if fiber Epi is in the Schubert\nvariety \u03a9I (Fp\u2022i ), then the fiber E\u2032 p is in the Schubert variety \u03a9I\u2212k (Fp\u2032\u2022 ).\nProof. All fairly obvious and proofs can be found in the appendix to [2].\n\n6.2\n\nQuantum Schubert calculus\n\nThe objective of this section is to show how Pieri's formula is a easy consequence of the relations of the previous section. Namely for the intersections\nin the Pieri formula, the relations reduce to d = 0 case which are classically\nknown by induction.\nAs in the classical approach of Hodge-Pedoe see [8], one can then prove\nGiambelli formula from Pieri. In [3] Pieri is deduced from Giambelli.\nDefinition 5. Define a map T : QH(Gr(r, n)) 7\u2192 QH(Gr(r, n)) by the rule\nT (\u03c3(I)) = q d1 (\u03c3(I \u2212 1)) where d1 = number of elements in I which are less\nthan or equal to 1. Notice that if k <= n, T k (\u03c3(I)) = q dk \u03c3(I \u2212 k) where\n18\n\n\fdk = number of elements in I which are less than or equal to k. This T is\nessentially T\u0398 of the previous section.\nTheorem 9. (reformulation of transformation property) The transformation\nproperty is equivalent to the property\nT (\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J)) = T (\u03c3(I)) \u22c6 \u03c3(J).\nThe proof of Pieri to follow is pure algebra beyond this point. We first\nnote the following\nLemma 7. Let \u03c3(I) have codimension less than or equal to n \u2212 1, then if\n\u03c3(K) appears in \u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J) with a q coefficient >= 1, then then there exists\nk so that \u03c3(K \u2212 k) appears in \u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J \u2212 k) with q degree = 0.\nProof. Suppose not, choose k so that the q degree is minimized and equals\nd. Let J \u2032 = J \u2212 k, and K \u2032 = K \u2212 k. since we cannot minimize the q\ndegree further, application of the operation T l tells us that if dl = number\nof elements in J \u2032 which are less than or equal to l, and cl = similar number\nfor K \u2032 then dl \u2264 cl . This clearly implies that codim(J \u2032 ) \u2264 codim(K \u2032 ). But\nwe also have\ncodim(I) + codim(J \u2032 ) = nd + codim(K \u2032 )\nthis yields a contradiction immediately if d >= 1.\nPieri formula is usually written in cohomological notation: for this we\nmake the following definitions.\nDefinition 6. If I = {i1 < * * * < ir } is a subset of {1, . . . n} then define\na(I, k) = n \u2212 r + k \u2212 ik for k = 1, . . . , r.\nDefinition 7. (special schubert cells) If a <= n \u2212 r define \u03c3a = \u03c3(Ia ) where\nIa = {n \u2212 r + 1 \u2212 a, n \u2212 r + 2, . . . n \u2212 r}.\nTheorem 10.\n\u03c3a \u22c6 \u03c3(I) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c3(K) + q\n\nK\n\nX\nL\n\nwhere the K sum is over all K satisfying\n\n19\n\n\u03c3(L).\n\n\fn \u2212 r \u2265 a(K, 1) \u2265 a(I, 1) \u2265 a(K, 2) \u2265 * * * \u2265 a(K, r) \u2265 a(I, r)\nand\ncodim(I) + a = codim(K).\nand the L sum is over all L satisfying\na(I, 1) \u2212 1 \u2265 a(L, 1) \u2265 a(I, 2) \u2212 1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 a(I, r) \u2212 1 \u2265 a(L, r) \u2265 0\nand\ncodim(I) + a = codim(L) + n.\nNotice that there are no L terms if a(I, r) = 0.\nProof. The statement about the K terms is classical [8]. Let us first show\nthat there are no terms with q 2 and higher. From the previous lemma there\nis then L\u2032 and and I \u2032 so that I = I \u2032 \u2212 k and L = L\u2032 \u2212 k, so that\n\u2022 \u03c3(L\u2032 ) appears with q degree =0 in \u03c3a \u22c6 \u03c3(I \u2032 )\n\u2022 dk <= ck \u2212 2 where dk = number of elements in I \u2032 \u2264 k, and ck =\nnumber of elements in L\u2032 \u2264 k.\nLet dk = j. Then a(L\u2032 , j + 2) \u2264 a(I \u2032 , j + 1) tells us that if L\u2032 = {l1\u2032 \u2264\n* * * \u2264 lr\u2032 } and I \u2032 = {i\u20321 \u2264 * * * \u2264 i\u2032r } then\n\u2032\nn \u2212 r + (j + 1) \u2212 lj+2\n\u2264 n \u2212 r + j \u2212 i\u2032j+1\n\nor what is the same\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni\u2032j+1 + 1 \u2264 lj+2\nhence lj+2\n\u2265 i\u2032j+1 + 1. But i\u2032j+1 > k , therefore lj+2\n> k+1\nwhich is in direct contradiction to dk <= ck \u2212 2.\nWe now deal with the q 1 terms. We find L\u2032 and I \u2032 as before so that\ndk = ck \u2212 1. Let dk = j. ck = j + 1. Then contemplation of I = I \u2032 \u2212 k and\nJ = J \u2032 \u2212k gives the result. For example let us only verify a(I, r)\u22121 \u2265 a(L, r).\n\u2032\nIt is clear that lr = lj+1\n\u2212 k + n, and ir = i\u2032j \u2212 k + n.\nso we need to verify\nn \u2212 r + r \u2212 lr \u2264 n \u2212 r + r \u2212 ir \u2212 1\n20\n\n\for that\nir + 1 \u2264 lr\nor that\n\u2032\ni\u2032j + 1 \u2264 lj+1\n.\n\nwhich is just\na(I \u2032 , j) \u2265 a(L\u2032 , j + 1)\nwhich is already known classically.\nThe tediousness of the above proof is made up by the simplicity of the\nproof of Giambelli formula. The essential part of which is the the following\nformula. Because of our Homological -cohomological notation problems we\nneed to make one definition.\nDefinition 8. Let \u0103 = a1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 ar be given, then define I(\u0103) by il =\nn \u2212 r + l \u2212 al . If this is not a subset of {1, ..n} define \u03c3(I(\u0103)) to be zero. Also\ndenote \u03c3(I(\u0103)) by \u03c3a1 ,...,ar and ignore 0's in the subscript if they appear.\nTheorem 11.\nd\n\n(\u22121) \u03c3a1 ,...ad =\n\nd\nX\n\n(\u22121)j \u03c3a1 ,...,aj\u22121 ,aj+1 \u22121,...,ad \u22121 \u22c6 \u03c3aj +d\u2212j .\n\nj=1\n\nProof. Note that on the lhs the length of the string \u0103\u2032 = {a1 , . . . , aj\u22121 , aj+1 \u2212\n1, . . . , ad \u2212 1} is less than r. So a\u2032r = 0. Hence no q 1 terms are produced via\nPieri, and the formula in q degree 0 is known classically [8] page 205. Hence\nthere is really nothing (new) to prove. Iteration of this gives the Giambelli\nformula as in [8].\nFulton and Woodward have proved a theorem on the smallest power of\nq in the quantum product of Schubert subvarieties in the case of G/P , P\nmaximal parabolic. We prove the Grassmann case of their theorem in a\nslightly strengthened form.\nTheorem 12. (Fulton-Woodward) The smallest power of q appearing in\n\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J) is the number d = max{di + d\u2032j \u2212 r : i + j = n} where di =\nnumber of elements in I which are less than or equal to i, d\u2032j = number of\nelements in J which are less than or equal to j. Moreover, if the max is\nachieved for i, j : i + j = n, then\n21\n\n\f\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J) = q d (\u03c3(I \u2212 i) \u222a \u03c3(J \u2212 j)) + higher order terms.\nwhere the cup product \u222a on the right hand side is the cup product in usual\ncohomology.\nRemark: The 'strengthened' part refers to identification of the lowest\norder terms which is curiously a product in the ordinary cohomology. This\nmay not be true for all G/P 's. Also the associativity of quantum cohomology\nhas not been used so far!\nProof. We know T n = multiplication by q r , therefore\nq r (\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J)) = T n (\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J)).\n= T i (\u03c3(I) \u22c6 T j (\u03c3(J)\nwhen i + j = n,\n\u2032\n\n= q di +dj \u03c3(I \u2212 i) \u22c6 \u03c3(J \u2212 j).\nTherefore, if i + j = n,\n\u2032\n\n\u03c3(I) \u22c6 \u03c3(J) = q di +dj \u2212r \u03c3(I \u2212 i) \u22c6 \u03c3(J \u2212 j).\nSuppose that we choose i, j(with sum = n) so as to maximize di + d\u2032j \u2212 r\nthen clearly for I \u2032 = I \u2212 i and j \u2032 = J \u2212 i, we have ck + c\u2032n\u2212k \u2264 r, for any k\n(here ck = number of elements in I \u2032 which are less than or equal to k, c\u2032n\u2212k =\nnumber of elements in J \u2032 which are less than or equal to n \u2212 k. ) this tells\nus that the dual of \u03c3(I \u2032 ) is contained in \u03c3(J \u2032 ), for a choice of flags. Hence\nby Kleiman's Bertini theorem, we have \u03c3(I \u2032 ) \u2229 \u03c3(J \u2032 ) 6= 0.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Agnihotri and C.
