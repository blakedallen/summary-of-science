M 87 is the first extragalactic source detected at the TeV that is not a blazar. To account for\nthe recent observations of M 87 made by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope array,\nwe developed a new multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton model.\nIn the framework of this model, we present here the predictions for the very high energy emission of\nthree active galactic nuclei with extended optical or X-ray jets which could be misaligned blazars, namely\nCen A, PKS 0521\u221236 and 3C 273.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe detection of M 87 at very high energies (VHE; > 100GeV) by HEGRA (Aharonian et al. 2003), confirmed\nby H.E.S.S. (Aharonian et al. 2006), made it the first extragalactic object detected at the TeV range that is\nnot a blazar. This discovery is probably the first insight toward further detections of objects already known to\nhave an extended optical/X-ray jet with a moderate beaming towards us, but which are not genuine BL Lac\nobjects.\nPredictions of the VHE emission in the framework of a new synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model\nof the jet for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) whose jet is not aligned with the line of sight, are presented here for\n3 AGNs, Cen A, 3C 273 and PKS 0521\u221236.\nIn Sect. 2, we briefly present our SSC model, in Sect. 3, 4 and 5, we present applications of this model to\n3C 273, Cen A and PKS 0521\u221236 respectively, and conclusions are given in Sect. 6.\n2\n\nThe multi-blob model\n\nWe developed a synchrotron self-Compton emission model for extragalactic object which jet is not aligned with\nthe line of sight. The present work is based on the study of Katarzy\u0144ski et al. (2001, 2003), who describe\nthe radiative transfer of a single spherical relativistic blob of plasma moving along the jet axis. The blob is\nimmersed in a uniform magnetic field. The emission from radio to optical/UV wavelengths is attributed to an\ninhomogeneous conical extended jet.\nIn our model, a cap, located in the large opening angle formation zone at the base of the jet, is filled with\nseveral blobs of plasma that radiate through synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering on the synchrotron\nphotons (synchrotron self-Compton) over all frequencies from radio to VHE. This geometry allows to have some\nblobs that propagate close to the line of sight, even for sources which jet is misaligned, and thus are Doppler\nboosted, as in the case of blazars. For more details on the multi-blob model, see Lenain (2007) and Lenain et\nal. (2007).\n3\n\n3C 273\n\n3C 273 (z = 0.158) is the first quasar that was identified as a high-redshift object. The maximum acceptable\nviewing angle of its jet is about 15\u25e6 (Unwin et al. 1985). In Fig. 1, we show the spectral energy distribution\n1\n\nLUTH, Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot; 5 Place Jules Janssen, 92190 Meudon, France\n(jean-philippe.lenain@obspm.fr)\nc\n\n\f2\n\nSF2A 2007\n\n(SED) with the anticipated VHE flux in blue as computed with the multi-blob SSC model. The upper limit in\nred was obtained at 3\u03c3 by H.E.S.S. in 2005 (Aharonian et al. 2005), all the other data in gray are taken from\nT\u00fcrler et al. (1999). The V-shaped curve at VHE shows the H.E.S.S. sensitivity limit for a detection at 5\u03c3 in\n50 h of observation for a source at a mean zenith angle of 30\u25e6 . The expected sensitivity of the next generation\n\u010cerenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project of \u223c 0.1% Crab flux at 1 TeV in 50 h of observation is shown as a\nblue lower limit. The dashed line represents a simple blackbody model to illustrate the contribution of the big\nblue bump component in the UV. The parameters of the model are shown in Table 1, where \u0393b is the Lorentz\nfactor common to each blob, \u03b8 is the viewing angle with respect to the jet axis, Rcap is the distance between the\ncentral engine and the cap of blobs, rg = GMBH /c2 is the scale length with MBH the mass of the central black\nhole, B is the intensity of the magnetic field, rb is the radius of an individual blob, K1 , n1 , n2 , \u03b3min , \u03b3br and \u03b3c\nare the parameters describing the electron energy distribution which is parametrized as a broken power-law.\n\nFig. 1. Spectral energy distribution of 3C 273 with anticipated VHE flux.\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, a strong detection of 3C 273 by the current \u010cerenkov facilities would be difficult\nto interpret within our nuclear multi-blob scenario. One solution would be to invoke different electron energy\ndistribution among the blobs, which could result in a tail of the inverse Compton bump at VHE that could\naccount for an eventual VHE detection. Another alternative would be the presence of an external inverse\nCompton component, which is then thought to be only weakly variable. Further observations with GLAST\n(10 keV\u2013300 keV) and H.E.S.S. II, which will extend the spectral domain of H.E.S.S. down to \u223c 20 GeV with a\nbetter sensitivity, are crucial to distinguish between the different scenarii.\n4\n\nCen A\n\nCen A is the nearest radiogalaxy (z = 0.0018). Although it is a nearby and well studied object, the value of the\nviewing angle of its jet is still controversial. Tingay et al. (1998) claim \u03b8 \u223c 50\u25e6 \u201380\u25e6 for the parsec-scale jet,\nwhereas Hardcastle et al. (2003) found \u03b8 \u223c 15\u25e6 for the 100 pc scale jet. We choose here to take an intermediate\nvalue of \u03b8 \u223c 25\u25e6 .\nFigure 2 presents the SED of Cen A with anticipated VHE flux, where the data sample shown in black is\nalmost the same as in Chiaberge et al. (2001), while the gray points are taken from the NED. We present in\nFig. 2 two solutions of the multi-blob model. The first one, presented in blue, assumes that the X-rays are\ngenerated by inverse Compton scattering. The second one, in green, assumes that the X-rays are of synchrotron\norigin. If the inverse Compton scattering produces emission in soft \u03b3-rays, the SSC emission of the central\nregion would definitely not provide a flux sufficient to be detected at VHE by current facilities. In that case, a\ndetection at VHE could favor the presence of an external inverse Compton component, such as on the starlight\nphotons of the host galaxy. On the other hand, if the soft \u03b3-rays are of synchrotron origin, then we expect a\ndetection of the core of Cen A at VHE by H.E.S.S. within 50 h of observation.\n\n\fPredictions of VHE \u03b3-ray fluxes for 3 AGNs\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Spectral energy distribution of Cen A with anticipated VHE flux within the multi-blob SSC model.\n\n5\n\nPKS 0521\u221236\n\nPKS 0521\u221236 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ, z = 0.055) with an optical jet. No superluminal motion\nis seen in its jet, the beaming effect is thus much less important than in the case of 3C 273. Indeed, the only\nconstraint on the jet orientation comes from Pian et al. (1996) who find \u03b8 \u2243 30\u25e6 \u00b1 6\u25e6 from SSC models.\nIt should also be noted that this object oscillates between a Seyfert-like and a BL Lac state (Ulrich 1981),\nmaking it difficult to interpret within a purely non-thermal scenario, especially since we are confronted to\nnon-simultaneous data.\n\nFig. 3. Spectral energy distribution of PKS 0521\u221236 with the multi-blob SSC model.\n\nFigure 3 presents the SED of PKS 0521\u221236 with anticipated VHE flux as computed with the multi-blob\nmodel. The black points are X-ray data taken by BeppoSAX in 1998 and by EGRET in 1994, while the\ngray points provided by the NED show the radio and optical data. The green points are more recent X-ray\nmeasurements by Swift/XRT in 2005. The black line in radio represents a model of synchrotron emission of an\nextended conical jet, while the black line in optical is a rough modeling of the host galaxy. The blue and green\nlines are two extreme geometric cases within the multi-blob model in which the line of sight is aligned with the\nvelocity vector of a blob (blue line) or passes exactly through the gap between three blobs, thus leading to a\nweaker beaming effect (green line).\n\n\f4\n\nSF2A 2007\n\nIf the X-rays were due to inverse Compton scattering, it would be on photons from the radio/optical contribution which is not variable, coming from an extended part of the jet. Since the X-rays are highly variable\nin this object, they are likely due to the synchrotron process. In this case, PKS 0521\u221236 should be marginally\ndetectable by current \u010cerenkov such as H.E.S.S. and easily detectable by H.E.S.S. II and CTA.\nTable 1.

This model accounts in a simple way for a differential Doppler boosting by modeling the radiative transfer\nin several blobs of plasma located in the broadened zone at the base of the jet. This scenario provides the\npossibility to extend standard leptonic models of TeV blazars to other types of AGNs which jet is misaligned.\nHowever we can not exclude other leptonic or hadronic models. More observations are needed to constrain the\nemission models and to distinguish between hadronic and leptonic scenarii. This will be hopefully feasible with\nthe next generation of \u03b3-ray facilities, such as GLAST, H.E.S.S. II and CTA.\nThe author would like to thank Dr. C. Boisson and Dr. H.
