It should be noted that in previous work on Raman superradiance [19, 20], atoms are removed from a condensate\naccompanied by a change in hyperfine ground state. Although it may be tempting to refer to this as an outcoupling\nprocess, we feel that this physical mechanism cannot be associated with the term \"outcoupling\" in the context of\natom lasers. Firstly and foremost, the process transfers atoms to an untrapped state, which is unsuitable for atom\nlasers and their applications. Secondly, superradiance typically operates in a short pulse regime, and cannot be\noperated continuously.\n19. D. Schneble, G. K. Campbell, E. W. Streed, M. Boyd, D. E. Pritchard, and W.

These correlation measurements\nhave extended the analogy between optical and atom lasers into the quantum regime, and pave\nthe way to observing quadrature squeezing and entanglement in an atomic beam. Firstly, however, two criteria should be met: (i) The atom laser beam should ideally be composed of a single\nstate, as multi-state beams, such as those produced by radio frequency (RF) or Raman coupling\nbetween Zeeman states, add classical noise and can contribute to false atom counts, and (ii), a\nmethod for producing correlations in the atomic beam that is compatible with (i) must be found.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate an atom-laser system which meets both these criteria, based on\noptical Raman transitions between the hyperfine ground states of 87 Rb.\nThe coherence properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) led to the first demonstration of an \"atom laser\" [2]; a coherent beam of atoms which can be viewed as a macroscopic\nmatter wave, in direct analogy with an optical laser. Atom laser outcouplers for magnetically\ntrapped BECs operate by transferring atoms from trapped to untrapped Zeeman states. This\nis accomplished using either optical two-photon (Raman) transitions [3, 4, 5], or non-optical\n(RF or microwave) single-photon transitions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], both of which have been extensively studied. RF outcoupling between Zeeman levels of a given hyperfine state is by far the\nmost common method used. However, for typical magnetic trap bias fields, only the first order Zeeman shift is substantial and adjacent Zeeman levels are symmetrically split, resulting in\ncoupling to all 2F + 1 sublevels, where F is the total angular momentum of the hyperfine atomic\nstate. This produces a multi-state atom laser beam that is not ideal for applications involving the\nmeasurement of quantum statistics, and unsuitable for coherent atom interferometry and precision measurement. Microwave outcoupling can be used to produce a single-state atom laser\nbeam by coupling two Zeeman levels of different hyperfine states, which ensures that no other\ntransitions are resonant [1, 11]. However, interactions between outcoupled and trapped atoms\nleads to beams with complex spatial modes and a high divergence when compared with the spatial Heisenberg limit [4, 8, 9, 10]. This can be avoided by outcoupling from the bottom of the\ncondensate, which minimises the interaction time [12, 1], but also limits the flux. Outcoupling\nfrom the centre of the condensate maximises the atomic flux, and optical Raman transitions\nhave the advantage of transferring momentum, up to a maximum of two photon recoils, to the\noutcoupled atoms, reducing the interaction time between trapped and outcoupled atoms. High\n\n\fbrightness atom lasers with a gaussian spatial mode can be produced with this technique; such\nbeams approach the Heisenberg limit [4]. Another advantage of optical-based outcoupling over\nboth RF and microwave outcoupling is the potential to produce correlations in an atom laser\nbeam (or between two atom-laser beams) via quantum state transfer of a squeezed optical state,\nbased on the system proposed by Haine et al. [13, 14]. However, to date, Raman outcouplers\nhave only operated by coupling Zeeman levels in a single hyperfine state [18], leading to multistate beams.\nWe demonstrate operation of a Raman coupler based on a novel optical design in which\nboth beams are sourced from a single external cavity diode laser (ECDL). The coupler operates\nresonantly between only two Zeeman levels, one in each of the hyperfine ground state of 87 Rb,\nand is capable of driving \u2206mF = \u00b11, 0 transitions. The \u223c 6.8 GHz splitting of the hyperfine\nlevels results in a two-state system for a large one-photon detuning. Used as an outcoupler,\nthis produces an atom laser in a single quantum state with all the aforementioned advantages\nof a Raman outcoupler, and we present results focussed primarily on atom laser production.\nUsing \u2206mF = 0 transitions, our laser-system can also be operated as a hyperfine state atomic\nbeamsplitter [15]. All these properties make it a versatile tool for coherent atom interferometry,\nprecision measurement, and experiments investigating entanglement of massive particles.\n2.\n\nMethod\n\nTo test and characterise the outcoupler, we prepare BECs of 87 Rb in the |F = 1, mF = \u22121i state\nof typically 2.5 \u00d7 105 atoms with no discernible thermal fraction. Our Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic\ntrap has trapping frequencies of \u03c9y = 12 Hz and \u03c9x , \u03c9z = 128 Hz, a field gradient of 200 G/cm,\nand a stable bias field of 2 G at the trap minimum allowing highly reproducible atom laser\nproduction. A typical (destructive) absorption image is given in Fig. 1(a). 5 ms of weak Raman\noutcoupling is applied using the three-level coupling scheme of Fig. 1(b) with the Raman beam\ngeometry shown in Fig. 1(c). The magnetic trap is then suddenly switched off allowing the\ncloud and atom-laser beam to ballistically expand for 15 ms. The atoms are then illuminated\n\nFig. 1. (a) Typical atom laser absorption image, (b) energy level scheme for outcoupling\n(not to scale), and (c) Raman beam geometry. Only the F \u2032 = 1 manifold of the 52 P3/2\n~0 , is diexcited state of 87 Rb is shown. \u03b4 is the two-photon detuning. The bias field, B\nrected along the long axis of the condensate (y in (c)), and defines the quantization axis.\nWe direct the modulated Raman beam along this direction, with circular polarization to\ndrive absorption of a \u03c3 + photon from the \u03c9+2 sideband. The unmodulated Raman beam\n~0 to drive emission of a \u03c0 photon. The\npropagates upwards and is linearly polarized along B\n\u221a\ntwo-photon transition gives the outcoupled atoms a net momentum kick of 2h\u0304k producing\na beam in the continuous regime.\n\n\fFig. 2.

A phasor diagram of the\nfrequency components in each of the two Raman beams is included after each fiber coupler.\nNote that higher order sidebands are present in the modulated beam, but only first order are\ndisplayed in the diagram. A potential optical squeezer is included on one Raman beam to\nemphasise the possibility of using the setup to transfer squeezed photon statistics to the\natom laser.\n\nby a 100 \u03bc s pulse of resonant light, and imaged onto a CCD camera. The beam is displaced to\nthe side, and away from the BEC for this expansion time, due to the momentum transfer from\nthe Raman transition. It has a low divergence typical of a Raman outcoupler, and only contains\natoms in a single internal state.\nProduction of the two Raman laser beams is schematically represented in Fig. 2. Laser light\nis sourced from an ECDL, red-detuned by \u2206 \u2243 90 GHz from one-photon resonance in order\nto suppress spontaneous emission. In this limit, and for a three level-system (Fig. 1(b)), the\ncoupling strength for a Raman transition is characterized by the (two-photon) Rabi frequency,\n(2)\n\u03a9Rabi = \u03a91 \u03a92 /4\u2206, where \u03a91 \u221d |~\nE0,1 | and \u03a92 \u221d |~E0,2 | are the one-photon Rabi frequencies for\n(2)\neach light field with amplitudes |~\nE0,1 | and |~E0,2 | respectively. Therefore, \u03a9Rabi \u221d |~E0,1 ||~E0,2 |/\u2206.\nThe light is first sent through an acousto-optic modulator in a double pass configuration to allow\nfor intensity control, and fast shuttering on the order of 100 ns, before being split equally at a\npolarizing beamsplitter. One beam is sent through a phase modulator, driven at \u03c9m \u2243 3.4 GHz\nby a Rhode & Schwarz SMR-20 microwave generator. A phase modulated source results in\nn\nin\u03c9m t\n~0 ei\u03c9c t \u2211\u221e\n,\nsidebands according to the relation ~E = ~E0 ei(\u03c9ct+\u03c6 /2 cos(\u03c9mt)) = E\nn=\u2212\u221e i Jn (\u03c6 /2)e\nth\nwhere Jn (\u03c6 /2) is the n order Bessel function of the first kind and represents the amplitude\nof the nth order sideband. Every pair of frequencies seperated by 2\u03c9m \u2243 6.8 GHz can drive the\nRaman transtion and contribute to the coupling strength. However, the different pairs contribute\n(2)\ndestructively for phase modulated light and \u03a9Rabi \u221d \u2211\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e Jn (\u03c6 )Jn\u22122 (\u03c6 /2)/\u2206 goes to zero\n[16]. It is therefore necessary to modulate only one Raman beam resulting in a coupling strength\n\u221d |~\nE0,\u03c9c |J\u00b12 (\u03c6 )/\u2206, due to one of the second order sidebands, \u03c9\u00b12 , at \u03c9c \u00b1 2\u03c9m beating with\nthe carrier. Indeed, we have not observed Raman transitions when using phase modulated light\nfor both Raman beams. We monitor the sidebands in the modulated beam using a commercial\nconfocal cavity with a free spectral range of 10 GHz, and measure 20% of the total power in\neach of the second order sidebands, with the carrier suppressed to less than 5%. The remaining\npower is distributed among the first and higher order sidebands that do not interact with the\n\n\fatoms to drive any one or two photon transitions. We have modulated the EOM at half the\nhyperfine splitting of 87 Rb to ensure that there is sufficient modulation depth to supress the\ncarrier, as it otherwise forms a standing wave with the unmodulated beam that results in Bragg\ndiffraction of the condensate and any outcoupled atoms. Finally, both beams are coupled into\npolarization maintaining fibers to produce a single spatial mode, and are collimated at the output\nto an \u223c 1 mm diameter. This results in approximately 4 and 8 mW of power after the fibers for\nthe modulated and unmodulated beams respectively.\nThe beams are directed and focussed onto the condensate as shown in Fig. 1(c), using a 10 cm\nand 50 cm focal length lens for the horizontal and vertical beam respectively. This geometry\nwas chosen to allow for polarization to be set such that a photon is absorbed from the \u03c9+2\ncomponent in the horizontal beam (\u03c3 +\u221a), and emitted into the unmodulated vertical beam (\u03c0 ),\nresulting in a momentum transfer of 2h\u0304k at 45\u25e6 relative to gravity. If this is not done, the\npresence of a \u03c3 \u2212 component produces a second beam with the opposite momentum kick due to\nthe lower sideband, \u03c9\u22122 . It would be straightforward to remedy this if necessary by frequency\nfiltering the modulated beam using an optical cavity.\nBased on our parameters, we estimate the maximum intensity at the condensate to be on the\n(2)\norder of 10 W/cm2 leading to a maximum calculated Rabi frequency of \u03a9Rabi = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 20 kHz.\nOur setup can be operated in the continuous weak-coupling regime, or in the pulsed strongcoupling regime. Following the work of Haine et al. [13, 14], it would be straightforward to\nincorporate a squeezed optical beam as one of the Raman beams, allowing production of a\nquadrature squeezed atom laser.\n3.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nTo determine the microwave frequency operating points, we measuring resonance curves for\nboth weakly- and strongly-coupled systems. In the weakly-coupled system, we use a Rabi\n(2)\nfrequency of \u03a9Rabi \u2243 2\u03c0 \u00d7 200 Hz, and a long Raman pulse of 100 ms, plotting the number of atoms remaining in the condensate in Fig. 3(a) as a function of the two-photon detuning, \u03b4 . The solid line is a theoretical fit based on an integration of the Thomas-Fermi\ndensity, |\u03c8 (x, y, z)|2 = 1/U(\u03bc \u2212 m/2(\u03c9y2 y2 + \u03c9r2 [x2 + z2 ])) over a resonant slice of energy\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nwidth. h\u0304\u03a9Rabi , and assuming a flux directly proportional to this number times \u03a9Rabi [5].\nU = 4\u03c0 h\u03042 a/m is the effective atomic interaction strength, a the s-wave scattering length,\n\u03bc = (15NU \u03c9y \u03c9r2 /8\u03c0 )2/5(m/2)3/5 the chemical potential, with N the total number of condensate atoms, and m the atomic mass of 87 Rb. If we compare the microwave frequency corresponding to the minimum in this curve to the most recently published value for the ground\nstate hyperfine splitting of 87 Rb [17], we find it to be in agreement to 1 part in 108 , where we\nhave used a frequency counter locked to a GPS reference oscillator to calibrate our microwave\nfrequency. \u03b4 = 0 is therefore equivalent to this point, taking account of the kinetic energy associated with the momentum transfer. In the strongly-coupled regime, a 60 \u03bc s Raman pulse\n(2)\nis used for our maximum measured Rabi frequency of \u03a9Rabi \u2243 2\u03c0 \u00d7 10 kHz, and the relative\nnumber of atoms transferred to the |2, 0i ground state is plotted as a function of \u03b4 in Fig. 3(b).\nThe solid line is a Lorentzian fit to the data, based on the envelope of a two-state rate model,\nused only to extract the operating point from the data. This point occurs at \u03b4 = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 kHz,\nand gives a direct measure of the maximum AC Stark shift in this system, in agreement with\nour previously stated estimate.\nAlthough we have estimated an upper bound on the maximum Rabi frequency of our outcoupler, accurate knowledge of the light intensity at the condensate is difficult to obtain. It is\ntherefore important to definitively calibrate the Rabi frequency for any given setup. This is accomplished by comparing experimental data with a comprehensive 3D mean field theory.

Resonance curves for the (a) weak- and (b) strong-coupling regimes, showing the\nlineshape of the resonance and the effect of the AC Stark shift. In (a), we use a 100 ms\noutcoupling pulse and plot the number of atoms remaining in the condensate as a function\nof two-photon detuning. The solid line is a fit to the experimental data using a ThomasFermi approximation, and integrating over a resonant slice of the wavefunction. In (b), the\nrelative number of atoms transferred to the F = 2 ground state is plotted as a function of\ntwo-photon detuning. A Lorentzian envelope is fitted to the data (solid line) to determine\nthe centre of the resonance. In both data sets, zero detuning corresponds to the centre of the\nRaman resonance for weak coupling, and error bars represent one standard deviation in the\ntotal atom number.\n\nRaman lasers are applied to the condensate for a fixed pulse length of 135 \u03bc s, and the power\nin the beams varied. This outcouples a pulse of atoms in the |2, 0i state, whose relative number\n(2)\ndepends on \u03a9Rabi , and is plotted in Fig. 4(a) as a function of the total power in the two beams.\nThe calibration is then extracted by fitting the experimental data to a 3D simulation of the\nGross-Pitaevski equation (GPE) based on measured parameters of our system. Our maximum\nattainable Rabi frequency is on the order of 2\u03c0 \u00d7 10 kHz.\nIn Fig. 4(b), we demonstrate coherent Rabi oscillations of our two-level system at the maximum Rabi frequency for this setup. The solid line represent a 3D simulation of the GPE for our\nexperimental parameters. For complete Rabi oscillations to occur, it is necessary for the spatial\nwavefunctions of each state to remain well overlapped over the duration of a Rabi cycle. As\nthe |2, 0i state receives an initial momentum kick in addition to experiencing a net acceleration\ndue to gravity, complete transfer was not observed, with a maximum transfer of \u223c 75% in the\nfirst oscillation. Over time, and successive oscillations, the overlap continues to decrease with\nfewer atoms oscillating between the two states. This behaviour is qualitatively captured by our\nnumerics.\nWe have also verified the ability to use our Raman laser system as a hyperfine state beamsplitter, by using a \u2206mF = 0 transition to transfer up to 95% of a pulse atoms of freely falling in\na |1, 0i state to a |2, 0i state; a crucial step towards a coherent Ramsey interferometer, and the\nsubject of a future publication.\n\n\f0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFig. 4. (a) Calibration of the two-photon Rabi frequency. The circles represent the relative\nnumber of atoms in the |2, 0i state as a function of total power in the Raman beams. (b) Rabi\noscillations between the |1, \u22121i and |2, 0i hyperfine ground states of 87 Rb. The relative\nnumber of atoms in the F = 2 ground state is plotted as a function of pulse time, with a\noscillation frequency of \u223c 10 kHz. Incomplete and decaying oscillations are observed due\nto an imperfect and decreasing overlap of the wavefunctions for the two coupled states in\ntime. In both data sets, the error bars represent one standard deviation in total atom number\nand the solid line is a simulation of the GPE for our experimental parameters, which allows\ncalibration of the Rabi frequency in (a).\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur Raman laser system is a versatile and effective tool for coherently manipulating BoseEinstein condensates. Operating via a pure two-state coupling, it produces atom lasers in a\nsingle atomic state and has the potential to transfer correlation statistics from a quadrature\nsqueezed optical beam, making it a promising tool for investigating quadrature squeezing of\natom lasers and entanglement in atomic beams. The same system can be operated as a coherent hyperfine state beamsplitter, a tool which is crucial for experiments in coherent Ramsey\ninterferometry and precision measurement. Although we have demonstrated operation of this\nsystem using 87 Rb, the optical setup is relatively straightforward compared with other phase\ncoherent microwave systems, and can easily be transfered to other typical condensate species\nsuch as sodium, lithium, or cesium.\n\n\f"}
