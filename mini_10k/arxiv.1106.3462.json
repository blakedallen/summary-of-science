Introduction\nHolger Brenner [Bre06] introduced a new closure operation on ideals in finitely\ngenerated C-algebras called continuous closure, and asks whether it is the same\nas an algebraic notion called axes closure that he introduces. He proves this for\nideals in a polynomial ring that are primary to a maximal ideal and generated by\nmonomials. We shall relate this closure to some variant notions of integral closure,\nspecial part of the integral closure over a local ring, introduced in [Eps10], and inner\nintegral closure, a notion explored here that exists without an explicit name in the\nliterature, and also to a notion we introduce called natural closure. We shall prove\nthat if I is an unmixed ideal in any affine C-algebra, then I is continuously closed\nif and only if it is axes closed. See Theorem 7.8, Corollary 7.14, and Corollary 7.15.\nWe also provide further conditions under which continuous closure equals axes\nclosure or natural closure.\nIn consequence we can prove, for example, that if f is a polynomial in C[x1 , . . . , xn ]\nthat vanishes wherever its partial derivatives all vanish, then there are continuous\nfunctions gj from Cn \u2192 C such that\nf=\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\ngj\n\n\u2202f\n.\n\u2202xj\n\nSee Theorem 6.1.\nOn the other hand, we show that continuous closure is sometimes strictly smaller\nthan axes closure. Indeed, in \u00a79, we give an example (followed by a method of\ngenerating such examples) of a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring over C which\nis continuously closed but not axes closed.\nAfter hearing the second named author give a talk on the results of this paper,\nKoll\u00e1r [Kol12] studied continuous closure in the context of coherent sheaves on\nschemes over C and has given an algebraic characterization that permits the notion\nof continuous closure to be defined in a larger context. In a further paper [FK13],\ncontinuous closure is studied over topological fields other than C, particularly for\nthe field of real numbers.\nLet R be a finitely generated C-algebra. Map a polynomial ring C[x1 , . . . , xn ] \u0589\nR onto R as C-algebras. Let A \u2286 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the kernel ideal, and let X\nbe the set of points in Cn where all elements of A vanish. X may be identified\nwith the set of maximal ideals of R. Then X has a Euclidean topology, and the\ntopological space X is independent of the presentation of R. We let C(Y ) denote the\nring of complex-valued continuous functions on any space Y . Polynomial functions\non Cn , when restricted to X, yield a ring C[X] which is isomorphic to Rred , the\noriginal ring modulo the ideal N of nilpotents. (Nothing will be lost in the sequel\nif we restrict attention to reduced rings R (i.e., rings without nonzero nilpotents).)\nThus, we have a C-homomorphism R \u2192 C(X) which is injective when R is reduced.\nThe continuous closure if I \u2286 R, denoted I cont , is the contraction of IC(X) to R.\nThat is, if I = (f1 , . . . , fm )R, then f \u2208 I cont precisely when there are continuous\nfunctions gi : X \u2192 C such that\nf |X = g 1 f 1 | X + * * * + g m f m | X ,\nwhere h|X indicates the image of h \u2208 R in C(X). Henceforth, we focus on the case\nwhere R is reduced, and omit |X from the notation. However, we can state many\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n3\n\nof the results without this hypothesis: one can typically pass at once in the proofs\nto the case where the ring is reduced.\nIn this paper we study this closure and several other closures that are related,\nobtaining satisfying answers to many quesstions that were open even for polynomial\nrings.\nLet L be an algebraically closed field. We are especially concerned with the case\nwhere L = C is the complex numbers. A finitely generated L-algebra R is called\na ring of axes over L if it is one-dimensional reduced and either smooth, with just\none irreducible component, or else is such that the corresponding algebaic set is the\nunion of n smooth irreducible curves, and there is a unique singular point, which\nis the intersection of any two of the components, such that the completion of the\nlocal ring at that point is isomorphic with L[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(xi xj | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n).\nWe now restrict to the case of the complex numbers. In [Bre06] Brenner obtains\na structure theorem for the ideals of such a completed local ring that enables him\nto prove that in a ring of axes over C, for every ideal I, I = I cont . The axes\nclosure I ax of an ideal I of R is defined to be the set of elements r such that\nfor every C-homomorphism R \u2192 S, where S is a ring of axes, one has r \u2208 IS.\nThe results of [Bre06] imply that I cont \u2286 I ax in general, and that they agree for\nideals of polynomial rings that are primary to maximal ideals and are generated by\nmonomials. As mentioned above, we prove here that continuous closure coincides\nwith axes closure for all ideals of affine C-algebras that are primary to a maximal\nideal, and in many other cases. We also show that an unmixed ideal (one that has\nno embedded primes) is axes closed if and only if it is continuously closed, and that\nthere exist continuously closed ideals which are not axes closed, which answers a\nquestion raised by Brenner.\nIn \u00a73 we prove that an element r of an affine C-algebra is in the axes closure\nof I \u2286 R if and only if x \u2208 IS for every homomorphism of R to an excellent\n(respectively, complete) Noetherian one-dimensional seminormal ring S. We use\nthe latter definition to extend the notion of axes closure to all Noetherian rings.\nSee Corollaries 4.2 and 4.4 and Definition 4.3.\nHere is a brief sketch of the contents of the paper:\nIn \u00a72, we discuss some important properties of continuous closure that we will\nneed. Some of this material is reviewed from [Bre06], but in some cases we need\nsharper or more general results. \u00a73 is devoted to seminormal rings and their connections to continuous and axes closures. In \u00a74, we extend the definition of axes closure\nto general Noetherian rings, characterizing it by maps to excellent one-dimensional\nseminormal rings, and we show that this agrees with the original definition in Brenner's setting. In \u00a75 we discuss the concepts of special and inner integral closure, and\nintroduce the notion of natural closure. We also introduce the notion of I-relevant\nideals, which are used to characterize when an ideal is naturally closed, and which\nplay a key role in proving the results of \u00a77. We show that the natural closure is\ncontained in the axes closure and, wherever it is defined, the continuous closure.\nThis \"traps\" continuous closure between two algebraically defined closures. This\nis the main tool used in \u00a7 7 to prove results on when axes closure and continuous\nclosure agree.\nOne of the main results of \u00a76 has already been stated in the second paragraph\nof this Introduction.\n\n\f4\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\n\u00a77 is mostly devoted to a number of important cases where natural closure and\naxes closure agree, and contains several of our main results. When these two agree\nand continuous closure is defined, it agrees as well. This yields the central result\nthan an unmixed ideal in an affine C-algebra is continuously closed if and only if it\nis axes closed. We also give a characterization of seminormal rings in terms of axes\nclosed ideals.\nIn \u00a78 we show that continuous and axes closure agree in the locally factorial twodimensional case. In \u00a79, we develop a \"fiber criterion\" to exclude certain elements\nfrom the continuous closure of an ideal. This allows us to construct examples of\ncontinuously closed ideals that are not axes closed (even a monomial ideal in a\nthree-dimensional polynomial ring). We apply this criterion in \u00a710 to show that\nfor monomial ideals in polynomial rings over C, continuous closure always equals\nmixed natural closure, which is defined in that section. Finally, we introduce in \u00a711 a\nclosure operation AX that is similar to ax , and agrees with it in equal characteristic\n0, but is based on weakly normal rings instead of seminormal ones, and thus is\nsometimes bigger in positive characteristic. The two notions and their relative\nusefulness are discussed.\nWe conclude this introduction by reminding the reader of the definition of a term\nwe have already used several times:\nDefinition 1.1. A closure operation # on (the ideals of) a ring R is an inclusion\npreserving function from ideals to ideals such that if the value on I is denoted I # ,\nthen for all ideals I \u2286 R, I \u2286 I # = (I # )# .\nWe refer the reader to [Eps12] for a detailed treatment of closure operations and\ntheir properties.\n2. Properties of continuous closure\nGiven a homomorphism R \u2192 S of finitely generated C-algebras we get an induced map in the other direction of the corresponding algebraic sets, X \u2190 Y , which\nis continuous in the Euclidean topologies (it is defined coordinatewise by restricted\npolynomial functions), and so there is a commutive diagram\nC(R) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C(S)\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nC[X] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C[Y ]\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nR \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S\nwhere the top and middle horizontal arrows are induced by the map Y \u2192 X.\nHence (cf.

Let I be an ideal of an affine C-algebra R, and F \u2286 R. If I\nis a continuously closed ideal, so is I :R F for every set F \u2286 R, and so is the\ncontraction of IRW to R for every multiplicative system W .\nProof. The second statement follows from the first, because the contraction of IRW\nto R is the union of the ideals I :R w for w \u2208 W , and since this set is directed, one\ncan choose w \u2208 W so that the contraction is the same as I :R w. Moreover, the\nstatement for F reduces to the case of a single element f , since an intersection of\ncontinuously closed ideals is evidently continuously closed.\nNow suppose that r \u2208 R is a linear combination with continuous coefficients\nPh\ng1 , . . . , gh of elements f1 , . . . , fh of I :R f . Then f r = i=1 gh (f fi ) where every\nf fi \u2208 I, and so f r \u2208 I cont = I, and r \u2208 I :R f , as required.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. If R is an affine C-algebra and I is a continuously closed ideal of\nR, then so is every primary component of I for a minimal prime P of I.\nProof. The minimal primary component corresponding to P is the contraction of\nIRW to R, with W = R \u2212 P .\n\u0003\nFor any ring homomorphism R \u2192 S, if I, J \u2286 R the product of the contractions\nof IS and JS is obviously contained in the contraction of (IJ)S = (IS)(JS).\nApplying this to the map C[X] \u2192 C(X), we have:\nProposition 2.4. If R is an affine C-algebra and I, J are ideals of R, then\nI cont J cont \u2286 (IJ)cont\n\u0003\nThe following result is proved in the standard-graded case in [Bre06].\nTheorem 2.5. Let R be a finitely generated N-graded C-algebra with R0 = C\nand let F1 , . . . , Fh \u2208 R be elements of positive degrees d1 , . . . , dh . Suppose F is\nhomgeneous of degree d, where d > di , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 h. Let I = (F1 , . . . , Fd )R. Suppose\nthat every element of positive degree has a power in I. Then F \u2208 I cont .\nProof. We may assume that R is reduced. We map a graded polynomial ring\nC[X1 , . . . , Xn ] \u0589 R,\nso that\nR = K[X1 , . . . , Xn ]/A,\nwhere A is the kernel, and the map preserves degree. Let Xj have degree ej .

The action then stabilizes X = V (A). Let 0 be the\norigin\nin Cn . Then x \u2208 X, and the Fj vanish simultaneously only at x.

We can extend the notion of continuous closure to the local ring\nRm of an affine C-algebra R at a maximal ideal m as follows. Let I be an ideal of\nRm . Let X be the affine algebraic set Max Spec(R) (in the Euclidean topology), let\nx \u2208 X correspond to m, and let S denote the ring of germs of continuous C-valued\nfunctions on X at x. Then define I cont as the contraction of IS to Rm .\nWhen I is an ideal of R, we write I cont,x for (IRm )cont .\nProposition 2.7. Let R be an affine C-algebra and let X be the corresponding\nalgebraic set. Let I be an ideal of R, and f \u2208 R. Then f \u2208 I cont if and only if for\nall x \u2208 X, f /1 \u2208 (IRm )cont , where m is the maximal ideal of R corresponding to x.\nPh\nProof. Let f1 , . . . , fh generate I. It is clear that if f =\ni=1 gi fi with the gi\ncontinuous on X, the equation persists when we take germs at x \u2208 X. For the\nconverse, suppose that f \u2208 R has image in (IRm )cont for all m. Then for every\nx \u2208 X, x has a neighborhood Ux in the Euclidean topology on X such that\nf |Ux =\n\nh\nX\n\ngix fi |Ux\n\ni=1\n\non Ux , where the gix are continuous functions on Ux . By making the neighborhoods\nUx smaller we may also assume that the gix are bounded on Ux . The open cover\n{Ux | x \u2208 X} has a locally finite refinement by open sets V\u03bb such that there are\ncontinuous [0, 1]-valued functions b\u03bb on X with the property that b\u03bb vanishes off\nV\u03bb and such that\nX\n1=\nb\u03bb .\n\u03bb\n\ni.e., the b\u03bb give a partition of unity.

Let R be a finitely generated C-algebra, with X the associated affine\nvariety. Let I \u2286 R be an ideal, and f \u2208 R. Let {Xj }j\u2208\u039b be an affine open cover of\nX, with Rj = R[Xj ]. Then f \u2208 I cont if and only if f \u2208 (IRj )cont for all j \u2208 \u039b.\nDiscussion 2.9 (ideal closures and gradings). At this point, we are only aiming to\nprove Proposition 2.10 below, but we eventually will want to prove similar results\nfor other closure operations where the issue is more difficult. Let R be a Zh -graded\nring, where h > 0 is an integer. Note that this case includes Nh -gradings and,\nof course, N-gradings. If \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1h ) is a k-tuple of units of R0 , where the\nsubscript is the zero element in Zh , there is a degree-preserving automorphism\n\u03b8\u03b1 of R that multiplies forms of degree (k1 , . . . , kh ) by \u03b1k11 * * * \u03b1khh . Suppose that\n#\nis a closure operation on ideals of R such that the closure of an ideal that\nis stable under these automorphisms is again stable under these automorphisms.\nSuppose that R0 contains an infinite field, or, more generally, that for every integer\nN > 0 that R0 contains N units \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N such that the elements \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j for\ni 6= j are also invertible. Then whenever I is homogeneous, its closure I # is also\nhomogeneous. By induction on h one can reduce to the case where\u0001 h = 1. The result\nthe follows from the invertibility of Vandermonde matrices \u03b1j\u22121\n, where the \u03b1i are\ni\ndistinct units whose nonzero differences are units. If f \u2208 I # is an element whose\nnonzero homogeneous components occur in degrees d, . . . , d + N \u2212 1, it suffices\nto have N units whose distinct differences are also units in R0 to conclude that\nthe homoogeneous components of f are in I # . See Discussion (4.1) in [HH94b].\nIf R0 does not have sufficiently many units to carry through the argument, one\ncan seek a family of Zh -graded R-algebras SN containing R such that R \u2286 SN\npreserves degrees and such that for all homogeneous ideals I \u2286 R and all N > 0,\nI # \u2286 (ISN )# while (ISN )# \u2229R = I. Then, if f \u2208 I # , we have that f \u2208 (ISN )# for\nall N , and for N sufficiently large this will imply that all homogeneous components\nof f are in (ISN )# and, hence, in (ISN )# \u2229 R = I # . In particular, this method will\nsucceed if one can choose SN to be the localization of R[t1 , . . . , tN ] at the element\ngN that is the product of all the ti and all the ti \u2212tj for i 6= j, which may be thought\nof as R0 [t1 , . . . , tN ]gN \u2297R0 R, and the grading is taken so that the degree zero part\nis R0 [t1 , . . . , tN ]gN . Note that these SN are smooth and faithfully flat over R. This\ndiscussion applies also to the case when I # is an ideal defined ring-theoretically in\nterms of I, even when # is not a closure operation, such as inner integral closure,\nwhich is treated in \u00a75.\nIf R is a finitely generated Zh -graded C-algebra, and \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1h are nonzero\nelements of C, the automorphisms \u03b8\u03b1 are C-automorphisms. Hence, if I is homogeneous, I cont is stable under these automorphisms by the persistence of continuous\nclosure (Proposition 2.1). Therefore, simply because C is an infinite field in R0 , we\nhave:\nProposition 2.10. Let R be a finitely generated Zh -graded C-algebra, and suppose\nthat C is contained in R0 , where the subscript indicates the zero element in Zh . Let\nI be a homogeneous ideal of R with respect to this grading. Then I cont is also a\nhomogeneous ideal of R with respect to this grading.\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\n3. Seminormal rings\nIn this section we review certain facts about seminormal rings and prove that\na reduced affine C-algebra is seminormal if and only if every ideal generated by a\nnon-zerodivisor is axes closed (equivalently, continuously closed).\nRecall [Swa80] that a ring R is seminormal if it is reduced and whenever f is an\nelement of the total quotient ring of R such that f 2 , f 3 \u2208 R, we have that f \u2208 R.1\nGiven a reduced Noetherian ring R with total ring of fractions T , there is a\nunique smallest seminormal extension Rsn of R within T , called the seminormalization of R.\nFor rings containing a field of characteristic 0 the property of being seminormal\nis equivalent to the property of being weakly normal. See Vitulli's recent survey\narticle [Vit11] for a treatment of both notions. (We will revisit the concept of weak\nnormality in \u00a711.) We collect several facts about seminormality that we will need in\nthe proposition below. A reference for each part is given with the statement, except\nfor (6), which is immediate from the definition of seminormal, and (7), which follows\nat once from (5) and (6) because the (strict) Henselization is a directed union of\nlocalized \u00e9tale extensions.\nProposition 3.1. Suppose R, S are reduced Noetherian rings. Let R\u2032 be the integral closure of R in its total ring of fractions.\n(1) Rsn is the set of all b \u2208 R\u2032 such that for any p \u2208 Spec R, b/1 \u2208 Rp +Jac(Rp\u2032 ),\nwhere Jac denotes the Jacobson radical, and Rp\u2032 is the localization of R\u2032 at\nthe multiplicative set R \\ p. [Tra70]\n(2) If g : R \u2192 S is faithfully flat and S is seminormal, then R is seminormal.\n[GT80, Corollary 1.7]\n(3) If R is seminormal and W is a multiplicative set, then W \u22121 R is seminormal. [GT80, Corollary 2.2]\n(4) Suppose the integral closure of R in its total quotient ring is module-finite\nover R. The following are equivalent: [GT80, Corollary 2.7]\n(a) R is seminormal.\n(b) Rm is seminormal for all m \u2208 Max Spec R.\n(c) Rp is seminormal for all p \u2208 Spec R.\n(d) Rp is seminormal for all p \u2208 Spec R such that depth Rp = 1.\n(5) Suppose g : R \u2192 S is flat with geometrically reduced (e.g. normal) fibers.\nIf R is seminormal, then so is S. [GT80, Proposition 5.1] In particular, if\nS is smooth over R, which includes the case where S is \u00e9tale over R, and\nR is seminormal, then S is seminormal.\n(6) A directed union of seminormal rings is seminormal.\n(7) If R is local and seminormal, then the Henselization of R and the strict\nHenselization of R are seminormal.\n(8) Suppose R is excellent and local. R is seminormal \u21d0\u21d2 R\u0302 is seminormal.\n[GT80, Corollary 5.3]\n(9) Let X be an indeterminate over R. R is seminormal \u21d0\u21d2 R[[X]] is seminormal. [GT80, Proposition 5.5]\n(10) Let R be a reduced affine C-algebra. Let R\u2032 be the integral closure of R in\nits total ring of quotients. Let X and Y be the varieties associated to R, R\u2032\n1The concept was introduced by Traverso [Tra70] for a more restricted class of rings. Swan\nshowed that under Traverso's assumptions, Swan's definition was equivalent to Traverso's.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n9\n\nrespectively. If \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X is the map induced from the inclusion R \u0592\u2192 R\u2032 ,\nthen the seminormalization of R consists of all regular functions f on Y\nsuch that f (y) = f (z) whenever y, z \u2208 Y are such that \u03c0(y) = \u03c0(z). [LV81,\nspecial case of Theorem 2.2]\n(11) Let R be a reduced affine C-algebra, and let S be the seminormalization\nof R. Then the map of affine algebraic sets corresponding to the inclusion\nR \u2286 S is a homeomorphism in both the Zariski and Euclidean topologies.\n[AB69, Theorem 1]\nWe note that passing to the seminormalization of a ring does not affect continuous closure in the following sense:\nProposition 3.2. Let R be a reduced affine C-algebra, and let S be the seminormalization of R. Let I be an ideal of R. Then (IS)cont \u2229 R = I cont .\nProof. By Proposition 3.1 (11), the affine algebraic sets associated with S and R are\nhomeomorphic. Call both of them X. The ideals I and IS have the same generators\nf1 , . . . , fn \u2208 R. The condition that f be a continuous linear combination of these\nelements is independent of whether we think of the problem over R or over S. \u0003\nThe following is a characterization of complete local 1-dimensional seminormal\nrings. It is based on Traverso's \"glueing\" construction.\nTheorem 3.3. Let k be a field, let L1 , . . . , Ln be finite algebraic extension fields\nof k, and let (V\nQi ,nmi ) be discrete valuation rings such that Vi /mi = Li . Let S be\nthe subring of i=1 Vi consisting of all n-tuples (v1 , . . . , vn ) such that there exists\n\u03b1 \u2208 k such that vi \u2261 \u03b1 (mod mi ) for all i. Then S is one-dimensional, local, and\nseminormal.\nConversely, let (R, m, k) be a complete one-dimensional seminormal Noetherian\nlocal ring. Then there exist such extension fields Li and such DVRs Vi (which,\nmoreover, are complete) such that R is isomorphic to the ring S described above.\nQn\nProof. Consider any so-described S, and let W :=\ni=1 Vi . Note that m =\nQ\nn\nm\n\u2286\nS,\nconsists\nof\nall\nnon-units\nof\nS,\nand\nso\nis\nthe\nunique maximal ideal\ni=1 i\nof S. Let u \u2208 m be an element of this product that is nonzero in every coordinate.\nThen u is a nonzerodivisor in S, and uW \u2286 m \u2286 S. It follows that W is the\nnormalization of S. It is then clear that S is\nQnone-dimensional. Since W is spanned\nover S by elements that map to a basis for i=1 Li over k, W is module-finite over\nS, and S is Noetherian by Eakin's theorem: see [Eak68] or [Nag68]. Finally, we\ncheck seminormality. Let 0 6= v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 W be such that v 2 , v 3 \u2208 S. Then\nthere exist \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 k \u2212 {0} such that vi2 \u2261 \u03b1 (mod mi ) and vi3 \u2261 \u03b2 (mod mi ) for all\ni. Consider the element \u03b3 := \u03b2/\u03b1 \u2208 k. It follows easily that vi \u2261 \u03b3 (mod mi ) for all\ni, whence v \u2208 S. Thus, S is seminormal.\nNow let (R, m, k) be a complete one-dimensional seminormal\nNoetherian local\nQn\nring. Let R\u2032 be the normalization of R. Note that R\u2032 = i=1 Vi , where (Vi , mi , Li )\nare discrete valuation rings, complete since R is complete. In particular, if p1 , . . . , pn\nare the minimal primes of R, then Vi = (R/pi )\u2032 . Moreover, since R\u2032 is module-finite\nover R, it follows that each Li is module-finite (i.e., finite algebraic) over k. Let S\nbe as described in the statement of the theorem for these particular k, Li , and Vi .\nClearly R embeds as a subring of S, since for any r \u2208 R, the map R \u2192 R\u2032 sends\nr 7\u2192 (r 1 , . . . , r n ) (where r i is the residue class of r mod pi ), and the residue class\nof each r i modulo mi is clearly the same as the residue class of r mod m, which is,\n\n\f10\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nof course, in k. So all we need to show is that the induced injective map from R to\nS is surjective.\nLet v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 S. Then there is some \u03b1 \u2208 k such that vi \u2261 \u03b1 (mod mi ) for\nall i. Take any r \u2208 R such\nQnthat r \u2261 \u03b1(mod m). Let w := v\u2212r = (v1 \u2212r1 , . . . , vn \u2212r n ).\nBy construction, w \u2208 i=1 mi = Jac(R\u2032 ). But by part (1) of Proposition 3.1, we\nhave m = Jac(R\u2032 ), since R is seminormal. Hence, w \u2208 m, whence v = r + w \u2208\nR + m = R, as was to be shown.\n\u0003\nNote: In Traverso's terminology, S is the glueing of R\u2032 over m. That is, S is the\npullback of the following diagram of ring homomorphisms:\nn\nY\n\nVi\n\ni=1\n\nk \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nn\nY\n\nLi .\n\ni=1\n\nNote: The above Theorem may also be deduced from the machinery developed in\n[Yos82], although it does not appear explicitly.\nLet L be an algebraically closed field. The notion of a ring of axes over L is\ndefined in the introduction. We shall also use the term affine axes ring over L to\nemphasize the distinction from other notions described below. By a complete axes\nring over L, we mean a ring of the form\nL[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(xi xj : 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n),\nwhere the xi are formal power series indeterminates. Such rings are known to be\nseminormal.2 When the xi are indeterminates over an algebraically closed field L,\nwe shall refer to\nL[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xi xj : 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n)\nas a polynomial axes ring (also called an affine ring of axes). Both complete axes\nrings and polynomial axes rings are seminormal. In fact, we have, we have parts (a)\nand (b) of the following proposition from [Bom73], while parts (c) and (d) follow\neasily from parts (a) and (b). (See also [Gib89] and [GW77] for connections with\nthe notion of F -purity.).\nProposition 3.4. Let L be an algebraically closed field.\n(a) A complete axes ring over L is seminormal.\n(b) Every complete local one-dimensional seminormal ring of equal characteristic with algebraically closed residue class field L is isomorphic with a complete ring of axes over L.\n(c) Every affine ring of axes over L is seminormal.\n(d) A one-dimensional affine L-algebra R is seminormal if and only if there\nare finitely many \u00e9tale L-algebra maps \u03b8i : R \u2192 Ai , where the Ai are affine\nrings of axes over L, and every maximal ideal of R lies under a maximal\nideal of some Ai .\n2Indeed, one can see this as a special case of Theorem 3.3.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n11\n\nProof. As already mentioned, parts (a) and (b) are proved in [Bom73]. Part (c)\nis then immediate from parts (4)(b) and (8) of Proposition 3.1, the definition of\naffine ring of axes over L, and the complete case of part (a) above. For part (d),\ne in A = Ai lies over m in R, then Rm \u2192 Am\nwe first prove \"if.\" Note that if m\ne is\nfaithfully flat. Since A is seminormal by part (c), so is Am\ne , and the result follows\nfrom Proposition 3.1 part (2). To prove \"only if\" it suffices to construct a cover\nby sets Spec(Ai ) that may be infinite, since we may use the quasicompactness of\nSpec(R) to pass to a finite subcover. Therefore, it suffices to construct an \u00e9tale\nextension A that is a ring of axes for each maximal ideal m of R so that mA 6= A.\nIf Rm is regular we may simply take A to be Rf for a suitable element f . For the\nfinitely many choices of m such that Rm is singular, we know the completion of Rm\nis a formal ring of axes. This implies that there is an \u00e9tale extension A of R that\nis an affine ring of axes with mA 6= A. To see why this is true, let S = Rm . Let B\ndenote the normalization of S, which is semilocal and regular. The normalization\nC \u2032 of the completion C of Rm is the product of the rings L[[xi ]]. Because S is\nan excellent domain, C \u2032 \u223c\n= C \u2297S B. Let T denote the Henselization of S. Then\nB \u2297S T is module-finite and regular over the Henselian local ring T , and so is a\nfinite product of discrete valuation domains. The completions of these give the\nvarious L[[xi ]]. T is a direct limit of \u00e9tale extensions of R in which there is a unique\ne lying over m. For a sufficiently large such extension A, B \u2297R A\nmaximal ideal m\nwill contain all of the idempotents of B \u2297S T , and will be regular. One may localize\ne so that it is a ring of axes with a unique singularity at\nA at one element not in m\ne.\nm\n\u0003\nDiscussion 3.5. Let R be a finitely generated C-algebra and m a maximal ideal of\nR. Map a polynomial ring T = C[X1 , . . . , Xn ] onto R so that the Xi map to generators of m. Then C[X1 , . . . , Xn ] \u2286 C{{X1 , . . . , Xn }}, the ring of convergent power\nseries in x1 , . . . , xn , and S = C{{X1 , . . . , Xn }} \u2297T Rm is the analytic completion of\nRm . This ring is a local, excellent, Henselian, faithfully flat extension of Rm , and\ncm with the second inclusion faithfully flat as well. We shall\nwe have Rm \u2286 S \u2286 R\nrefer to C{{X1 , . . . , Xn }}/(Xi Xj : i 6= j) as an analytic axes ring.\nProposition 3.6. Let R be a finitely generated C-algebra of dimension one. Then\nR is seminormal if and only if for every maximal ideal m of R such that Rm is not\nregular, the analytic completion of Rm is an analytic axes ring.\ncm is, and this is automatic\nProof. We know that R is seminormal if and only if each R\nif Rm is regular (which includes any isolated points). It is therefore sufficient to show\ncm = A\nb\nthat the analytic completion (A, mA ) of Rm is an analytic ring of axes if R\nis a formal ring of axes. Since A is one-dimensional excellent and Henselian, its\nb via expansion and\nminimal primes P1 , . . . , Pn correspond bijectively to those of A\nT\nb\ncontraction. Let Qi = j6=i Pj . Then Qi A is a principal ideal generated by an\nb from which it\nb = mA A,\nb 2 , Qi Qj = 0 for i 6= j, and P Qi A\nelement not in (mA A)\ni\nfollows that Qi is aP\nprincipal ideal generated by an element not in m2A , that Qi Qj = 0\nfor i 6= j and that i Qi = mA . Let xi generate Qi . Then the xi are a minimal set of\nP\nb\nb=\ngenerators of mA , xi xj = 0 for i 6= j, and since Pi A\nj6=i Qj A, we have that Pi is\ngenerated by {xj : j 6= i} for each i. The map C[X1 , . . . , Xn ] \u2192 A (sending Xi 7\u2192 xi\nfor all i) induces a C-homomorphism \u03b8 of B = C{{X1 , . . . , Xn }}/(Xi Xj : i 6= j)\nto A such that the map of completions is an isomorphism. Thus, this map is\n\n\f12\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\ninjective. If Pi is generated by the Xj for j 6= i, then B/Pi \u2192 A/Pi is a map from\nC{{Xi }} \u2192 A/Pi \u223c\n= C{{xi }} \u2286 A which induces an isomorphism of completions,\nand so must be an isomorphism. Since A is the sum of the subrings C{{xi }}, \u03b8 is\nsurjective.\n\u0003\nBoth in this section and the next we shall need to use Artin approximation to\ndescend a map from an affine K-algebra to a complete ring of axes over an extension\nfield L of K to a map to an \u00e9tale extension of a polynomial ring of axes, which will\nbe seminormal. Specifically:\nTheorem 3.7 (descent via Artin approximation). Let K be an algebraically closed\nfield, let L be an extension field, let R be an affine K-algebra, let I be an ideal\nof R, and let f , g be elements of R. Let R \u2192 S be a K-algebra homomorphism\nto a complete ring of axes S over L such that the image of g is not in IS. Then\nthere is a K-algebra homomorphism R \u2192 S0 , where S0 is an \u00e9tale extension of a\npolynomial ring of axes over K, such that the image of f is not in IS0 . Moreover,\nif the image of f is not a zerodivisor in S, the map R \u2192 S0 may be chosen to\nsatisfy the additional condition that the image of f is not a zerodivisor in S0 .\nProof. S is a complete ring of axes with algebraically closed residue class field L, and\nsuch a ring is the completion T of a polynomial axes ring L[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xi xj : i < j)\nlocalized at the maximal ideal m generated by the xj . Call the localized ring T0 .\nMoreover, we can choose N so large that the image of f is not in IT + mN T .\nThink of R as K[y1 , . . . , ys ]/(g1 , . . . , gh ). Then the images zj of the y1 , . . . , ys in T\ngive solutions of the equations gj = 0 in T , and we may use Artin approximation,\ni.e., the main result of [Art69], to find a solution z \u2032 1 , . . . , z \u2032 s of these equations\nin the Henselization T0h of T0 congruent to the zj modulo mN T . We can map\nR \u2192 T0h as a K-algebra so that the images of the yj map to the zj\u2032 and we still\nhave that f \u2208\n/ (I + mN )T0h . In particular, f \u2208\n/ IT0h . Since T0h is a direct limit of\nfinitely generated \u00e9tale extensions of B = L[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xi xj ), we have a finitely\ngenerated \u00e9tale extension C of B and a K-algebra map R \u2192 C such that f \u2208\n/ IC.\nHence, C = B[W1 , . . . , W\u0001m ]/(G1 , . . . , Gm ) is such that the image of the Jacobian\ndeterminant det \u2202Gj /\u2202Wj is a unit of C.\nNow let A denote a varying but finitely generated K-subalgebra over L sufficiently large to contain all the coefficients of the Gj . Let\nBA = A[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xi xj : i < j)\nand let\nCA = BA [W1 , . . . , Wm ]/(G1 , . . . , Gm ).\nThen C is the direct limit of the rings CA , and so the Jacobian determinant is\ninvertible in CA for all sufficiently large A. We may therefore chose A so large\nthat CA is \u00e9tale over BA and the map R \u2192 C factors R \u2192 CA \u2192 C. If D is any\nA-algebra we write BD and CD for D \u2297A BA and D \u2297A CA , respectively. Let K be\nthe fraction field of A. Then C = CL \u223c\n= L \u2297K CK is faithfully flat over CK . Hence,\nf\u2208\n/ ICK .\nWe have the exact sequences\n0 \u2192 IA \u2192 CA \u2192 CA /IA \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 f CA + ICA \u2192 CA \u2192 CA /(f CA + ICA ) \u2192 0, and\n0 \u2192 ICA \u2192 (f CA + ICA ) \u2192 WA \u2192 0,\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n13\n\nwhere WA is a cyclic CA module spanned by the image of f . By the lemma of\ngeneric freeness (cf. [Mat86, Theorem 24.1], [HR74, Lemma 8.1]), we can localize\nat one nonzero element a \u2208 A so that all of the modules in these sequences become\nAa -free. We change notation and continue to write objects with the subscript A:\nA has been replaced by Aa . The A-free module WA is not 0, since this is true even\nafter we apply K \u2297A . Let \u03bc be any maximal ideal of A. Then A/\u03bc = K, and we\nuse the subscript K to indicate these various algebras and modules after tensoring\nwith K = A/\u03bc over A. We have a map R \u2192 CK . Because WK 6= 0, we have that\nthe image of f is not in ICK \u2286 CK . But CK is a finitely generated \u00e9tale extension\nof BK which is a polynomial ring of axes over K.\nWe now consider the modifications needed to preserve the condition that the\nimage of f be a non-zerodivisor. Hence, the image of f in L[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(xi xj ) is\nnot in any of the ideals Pi generated by all of the xj for j 6= i. Then f \u2208\n/ Pi + mN\nfor sufficiently large N . Thus, we may choose N so large that when we apply Artin\napproximation, the image of f in the Henselization T0h is not in any of the ideals\nPi \u2229 T0h . When we replace the Henselization by a finitely generated \u00e9tale extension\nC of B, multiplication by the image of f may have a kernel, but the kernel will\nbe killed by localization at one element of C not in the contraction of the maximal\nideal of T0h . Thus, we may assume that the image of f is not a zerodivisor on\nC. For the last step in the descent, when we pass from CA to CA/\u03bc , we need to\n\u03c6\n\npreserve the exactness of the sequence 0 \u2192 CA \u2192 CA \u2192 CA /\u03c6CA \u2192 0, where \u03c6 is\nthe image of f , when we apply (A/\u03bc) \u2297A . We can do this by localizing at one\nelement of A \u2212 {0} so that all of the terms of the sequence become A-free.\n\u0003\n4. Axes closure and one-dimensional seminormal rings\nWe want to extend the notion of axes closure to a larger class of rings. We first\nnote:\nTheorem 4.1. Let R be a Noetherian ring and let I be an ideal of R. Then\nstatements (1), (2), and (3) below are equivalent.\nMoreover, if R is a finitely generated algebra over a field K of characteristic 0,\nand L is the algebraic closure of K, then the first six of the statements below are\nequivalent. If we also assume that K = L = C, then all seven of the statements\nbelow are equivalent.\n(1) For every map from R to an excellent one-dimensional seminormal ring S,\nthe image of f is in IS.\n(2) For every map from R to an excellent local one-dimensional seminormal\nring S, the image of f is in IS.\n(3) For every map from R to a complete local one-dimensional seminormal ring\nS, the image of f is in IS.\n(4) For every map from R to a complete local one-dimensional seminormal ring\nS with algebraically closed residue field, f \u2208 IS.\n(5) For every K-algebra map from R to a complete axes ring S with residue\nclass field L, f \u2208 IS.\n(6) For every K-algebra map from R to a finitely generated \u00e9tale extension S\nof a polynomial axes ring over L, f \u2208 IS.\n(7) For every C-algebra map \u03b8 from R to an analytic ring of axes (S, n) over\nC such that \u03b8\u22121 (n) is maximal in R, f \u2208 IS.\n\n\f14\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nProof. (1) =\u21d2 (2) =\u21d2 (3) =\u21d2 (4) =\u21d2 (5) is obvious. If R is only assumed\nNoetherian we can prove (3) =\u21d2 (1) as follows. Suppose that there is a map\nR \u2192 S, where S is one-dimensional and seminormal, such that f \u2208\n/ IS. Then this\ncan be preserved when we localize at some maximal ideal of S and then complete.\nThe completion of Sm is still seminormal. In the rest of the proof we assume the\nadditional hypothesis on R.\nTo see that (5) =\u21d2 (6): If (6) fails, we also have f \u2208\n/ ISm for a local ring Sm of\nS and also for the completion T of Sm . S is seminormal, and hence so is T , which\nwill have algebraically closed residue class field L. T is a complete axes ring; see\nProposition 3.4.\nWe next show that (6) =\u21d2 (1). Assume (6) and suppose that (1) fails for\nS. Then it also fails for some localization of S at a maximal ideal, and for the\ncompletion of that ring. Hence, we may assume that S is complete local. By part\n(7) of Proposition 3.1, we may replace S by its strict Henselization, which will have\nalgebraically closed residue class field since we are in equal characteristic 0, and we\nmay then complete again. We may therefore assume that S is a complete ring of\naxes with algebraically closed residue class field L. Extend K to a coefficient field\nfor S, which we also denote L. Then we have K \u2286 L \u2286 L \u2286 S. We may now\nreplace R by L \u2297K R: we still have a map from this ring to S, using the embedding\nL \u0592\u2192 L. The result now follows from Theorem 3.7.\nFinally, it is clear that (1) =\u21d2 (7), and it will suffice to prove that (7) =\u21d2 (6).\nSuppose that we have a map R \u2192 A where A is \u00e9tale over a polynomial ring of\naxes, such that f \u2208\n/ IA. Then A is a one-dimensional seminormal ring, and we\ncan preserve that f \u2208\n/ IA by localizing at some maximal ideal \u03bc of A. The inverse\nimage will be a maximal ideal of R, since R and A are affine C-algebras. Let (S, n)\nc\u03bc . Then A, A\u03bc , A\nc\u03bc , and S are\nbe the analytic completon of A\u03bc . Note that Sb \u223c\n=A\nseminormal by parts (5), (3), and (8) of Proposition 3.1 and S is an analytic axes\nring by Proposition 3.6. Since S is faithfully flat over A\u03bc and f \u2208\n/ IA\u03bc , it follows\nthat f \u2208\n/ IS, which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.2. If R is an affine C-algebra, the equivalent conditions (1) through\n(6) of Theorem 4.1 hold if and only if f \u2208 I ax .\nProof. If (1) through (6) hold, it is clear that f \u2208 I ax , since rings of axes are onedimensional excellent seminormal rings. Suppose that f \u2208 I ax . It suffices to verify\ncondition (6). Since L = K = C, by 3.1 it suffices to show that for every map\nto a one-dimensional affine seminormal ring S over R, the image of f is in IS. If\nnot, we can choose a maximal ideal m of S such that f \u2208\n/ ISm . By part (d) of\nProposition 3.4 there is an \u00e9tale map S \u2192 A such that A is an affine ring of axes\ne lying over m. Since the image of f is not in ISm\nover C and has a maximal ideal m\nand Sm \u2192 Am\ne is faithfully flat, we have that the image of f is not in IAm\ne and,\nhence, not in IA.\n\u0003\nDefinition 4.3. Theorem 4.1 shows that conditions (1), (2), and (3) are equivalent\nfor any Noetherian ring R. We therefore define f \u2208 R to be in the axes closure\nI ax of I in the general case if these three equivalent conditions hold. Once we have\nmade this definition, we have at once:\nCorollary 4.4. Let R be a finitely generated K-algebra, where K is a field of\ncharacteristic 0, I \u2286 R an ideal, and f \u2208 R. Then f \u2208 I ax if and only if the\nequivalent conditions (1) through (6) of Theorem 4.1 hold.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n15\n\nThe following remark is obvious from the definition, but is, nonetheless, quite\nimportant.\nProposition 4.5. Let R be an excellent one-dimensional seminormal ring. Then\nevery ideal of R is axes closed.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.6. Let R be a Noetherian ring.\n(1) The axes closure of an ideal is contained in its integral closure.\n(2) If R is normal domain, every principal ideal is axes closed.\nProof. One may test integral closure by mapping to Noetherian valuation domains,\nand these may be replaced by their completions, which are excellent. The second\nstatement follows, since principal ideals are integrally closed in a normal domain.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.7. If I, J \u2286 R, then I ax J ax \u2286 (IJ)ax . In particular, if r \u2208 R, r(I ax ) \u2286\n(rI)ax .\nProof. Let \u03b8 : R \u2192 B denote any homomorphism to an excellent one-dimensional\nseminormal ring. The first statement follows since I ax J ax B = (I ax B)(J ax B) =\n(IB)(JB) = (IJ)B, and the second statement follows from the case where J =\nrR.\n\u0003\nIn \u00a77 we prove that an excellent ring is seminormal if and only if every principal\nideal generated by a non-zerodivisor is axes closed: see Theorem 7.17\nExample 4.8. We give an example of a reduced finitely generated C-algebra of pure\ndimension two with precisely two minimal primes which is seminormal, although\none of its quotients by a minimal prime is not seminormal. Its normalization is the\nproduct of two polynomial rings in two variables. It has a principal ideal generated\nby a zerodivisor that is not axes closed. This example is similar to [GT80, Example\n2.11].\nLet S = C[u, v] \u00d7 C[x, y]. Let R be the subring of S generated over C by\nq = (u2 , x), r = (u3 , y), s = (v, 0), and t = (uv, 0). Then w = q 3 \u2212 r2 =\n(0, x3 \u2212 y 2 ) \u2208 R, and z = v + w = (v, x3 \u2212 y 2 ) is a non-zerodivisor in S and, hence,\nin R. Thus, e = (1, 0) \u2208 S is in the total quotient ring of R, since it is integral\nover R and ze = (v, 0) \u2208 R, (u, 0) is integral over R since its square is qe, which\nis integral over R, and it is in the total quotient ring of R, since z(u, 0) \u2208 R. It\nfollows that the integral closure of R is S.\n\u0001\nThen R consists of all pairs of the form P (u2 , u3 ) + vH(u, v), P (x, y) where\nH(u, v) is an arbitrary polynomial in u, v and P is an arbitrary\npolynomial in\n\u0001\nx, y. Alternatively, R consists of all pairs Q(u, v), P (x, y) such that Q(u, v) \u2261\nP (u2 , u3 ) mod vC[u, v]. From the latter description we see that R is seminormal,\nfor if Q(u, v)2 \u2261 P (u2 , u3 )2 mod vC[u, v] and Q(u, v)3 \u2261 P (u2 , u3 )3 mod vC[u, v],\nthen Q(u, v) \u2261 P (u2 , u3 ) mod vC[u, v].\nThe two minimal primes of S contract to incomparable primes P = (C[u, v]\u00d70)\u2229\nR and Q = (0\u00d7C[x, y])\u2229R. Clearly, P \u2229Q = 0. Note that (v, 0), (uv, 0) \u2208 P \u2212Q and\n(0, x3 \u2212 y 2 ) \u2208 Q \u2212 P . Hence, P and Q constitute all the minimal primes of R. We\nhave that R/P \u223c\n= K[u2 , u3 , uv, u], which is not seminormal, while R/Q \u223c\n= K[x, y].\nThe maximal spectrum of R, in the Euclidean topology, is the union of two complex planes, Max Spec(C[u2 , u3 , uv, v]), which may be identified topologically with\nMax Spec(C[u, v]) = C2 , and Max Spec(C[x, y]). These meet along a topological\n\n\f16\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nline which may be identified with V(v) in the first plane and with V(x3 \u2212 y 2 ) in the\nsecond plane.\nThen u represents a continuous function on C2 that may be restricted to the\nintersection and so viewed as a function on the closed set V(x3 \u2212 y 2 ) in the second\nplane. Hence, by the Tietze extension theorem there is a continuous function \u03b8\non the second plane that extends the restriction of u. The pair (u, \u03b8) represents a\ncontinuous C-valued function on Spec(R), and we have that (uv, 0) = (u, \u03b8)(v, 0).\nIt follows that (uv, 0) is in the continuous closure of (v, 0)R in R, and, hence, in\nthe axes closure. But it is not in the ideal.\nIn \u00a77 we prove that in a reduced affine C-algebra, axes closure and continuous\nclosure agree for principal ideals generated by a non-zerodivisor. We do not know\nwhether they agree for principal ideals generated by a zerodivisor.\nThe following result, together with Proposition 2.7 and Corollary 2.8, gives one\nsense in which the issue of whether axes closure and continuous closure agree in\naffine C-algebras is local.\nProposition 4.9. Let R be a Noetherian ring, I and ideal of R, and f \u2208 R.\n(a) If \u03c6 : R \u2192 S is any homomorphism and f \u2208 I ax , then \u03c6(f ) \u2208 (IS)ax . (In\nother words, axes closure is persistent.) Hence, the contraction of an axes\nclosed ideal is axes closed.\n(b) f \u2208 I ax if and only if for each P \u2208 Spec R, one has f \u2208 (IRP )ax .\n(c) f \u2208 I ax if and only if this holds in an affine open neighborhood of each\nprime ideal of R. In particular, I is axes closed if and only if this is true\nfor an affine open neighborhood of each prime of R.\nProof. The first statement in (a) is immediate from the definition, and the second\nstatement follows at once from the first statement.\nFor part (b): Part (a) guarantees that if f \u2208 I ax , this remains true when we\nlocalize. It will suffice to show that if f \u2208 (IRP )ax for all P then f \u2208 I ax . If not,\nwe can map to a one-dimensional local seminormal ring (S, Q) such that f \u2208\n/ IS.\nBut then f is not in (IRP )ax , where P is the contraction of Q.\nPart (c) follows at once.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.10. Let R be a Noetherian ring, and I an ideal. Let f \u2208 R, let\nJ be an ideal of R, and let W be a nonempty\nmultiplicative system in R. If I is\nS\u221e\naxes closed, then so are (I :R f ), (I :R J), n=1 (I :R J N ), and the contraction\nA = {r \u2208 R : for some w \u2208 W, wr \u2208 I} of IW \u22121 R to R.\nProof. Suppose g \u2208\n/ (I :R f ). Then f g \u2208\n/ I, and we can choose a homomorphism\nh : R \u2192 A, where A is a one-dimensional excellent seminormal ring, such that\nh(f g) \u2208\n/ IA. But then h(g) \u2208\n/ (IA :A h(f )) \u2287 (I :R f )A, which shows that\ng\u2208\n/ (I :R f )ax . This\nestablishes\nthe first statement.\nT\nSince I :R J = j\u2208J (I :R j), the second statement follows. The ideals (I :R J N )\nform an ascending chain, and so theSunion is equal to one of them. This proves\nthe third statement. Finally, A = w\u2208W (I :R w). The union is directed, since\n(I :R v) \u222a (I :R w) \u2286 (I :R vw). The family of ideals {(I :R v) | v \u2208 W } therefore\nhas a maximal element, which must be maximum, and the union consequently has\nthe form (I :R w).\n\u0003\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n17\n\nProposition 4.11. In any Noetherian ring R, every axes closed ideal is an intersection of primary axes closed ideals. If R is an affine C-algebra, these may be\ntaken to be primary to maximal ideals.\nProof. Let f \u2208\n/ I, where I is axes closed. Then we can choose a map h : R \u2192 A,\nwhere A is one-dimensional, excellent, and seminormal, and an ideal I of A such\nthat h(f ) \u2208\n/ IA. In any Noetherian ring, every ideal is an intersection of ideals J\nthat are primary to maximal ideals. We can choose such a primary ideal J of A so\nthat h(f ) \u2208\n/ J, and then h\u22121 (J) will be primary and axes closed with f \u2208\n/ h\u22121 (J).\nIf R is an affine C-algebra, we may take A to be an affine ring of axes over C. In\nthis case, the inverse image of the radical of J, which is a maximal ideal of A, is a\nmaximal ideal m of R, and the inverse image of J is primary to m.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.12. Let m be a maximal ideal of a Noetherian ring R, and let I be\ncm\nprimary to m and axes closed. Then the expansions of I to S = Rm and to S = R\nare axes closed. This is also true if S is the Henselization of Rm , or, when R is a\nfinitely generated algebra over C, the analytic completion of Rm .\ncm . Let f \u2208 S be an element of S \u2212 IS. Then,\nProof. Consider the case where S = R\nsince R/I \u2192 S/IS is an isomorphism, we may choose g \u2208 R such that g \u2261 f mod\nIS. By Definition 4.3 and Theorem 4.1, we can choose a map from R \u2192 A where\nA is a complete local seminormal ring of dimension 1 such that g \u2208\n/ IA. Since I\nmaps into the maximal ideal mA of A (or else IA would be the unit ideal), we have\nthat m maps into mA . But then the map extends continuously (in the m-adic and\ncm \u2192 A. Since the image of g is not in IA and\nmA -adic topologies) to a map S = R\nf \u2261 g mod IS, we have that the image of f \u2208\n/ IA. Thus, IS is axes closed. In the\nother cases, if f were in the axes closure of IS, it would be in the axes closure of\ncm as well, and we know this is I R\ncm . But in every instance S \u2192 R\nd\nIR\nm is faithfully\ncm to S is IS.\nflat, so that the contraction of I R\n\u0003\nThe following result is a weak result on the compatibility of axes closure with\nsmooth base change. It suffices to prove that axes closures of homogeneous ideals\nare homogeneous. See also Theorem 7.11, which is a much more difficult result on\ncompatibility of axes closure with smooth base change.\n\nProposition 4.13. Let R be Noetherian and let S be faithfully flat, essentially of\nfinite type, and smooth over R. Then for every ideal I \u2286 R, (IS)ax contracts to\nI ax in R.\nProof. Suppose that f is in the contraction of (IS)ax but not in I ax . Then we can\nchoose a homomorphism R \u2192 A, where (A, mA ) is a complete local one-dimensional\nseminormal ring, such that the image of f is not in IA. Then SA = S \u2297R A\nis faithfully flat, essentially of finite type, and smooth over A. By part (5) of\nProposition 3.1, SA is seminormal, and it is excellent. If we localize at a minimal\nprime Q of mA SA in SA , we obtain a one-dimensional, seminormal, local, faithfully\nflat, excellent extension B of A. Since the image of f is not in IA, we have that\nthe image of f is not in IB. But since R \u2192 B factors R \u2192 S \u2192 SA \u2192 B, this\ncontradicts the assumption that f is in (IS)ax .\n\u0003\nProposition 4.14. Let R be Noetherian, and suppose that R is Zh -graded, where\nh \u2265 1. Let I be a homogeneous ideal of R with respect to this grading. Then I ax is\nalso homogeneous with respect to this grading.\n\n\f18\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nProof. We want to apply Discussion 2.9. The only difficulty is that R may not have\nsufficiently many units. But each of the rings SgN constructed in Discussion 2.9 is\nfinitely presented, faithfully flat, and smooth over R, and so the result follows from\nthat discussion and Proposition 4.13 just above.\n\u0003\n5. Special and inner integral closure, and natural closure\nLet R be a Noetherian ring, I \u2286 R, and r \u2208 R. The following conditions are\nwell known to be equivalent:\n(1) There is a monic polynomial f (x) \u2208 R[x] of some degree d such that the\ncoefficient of xd\u2212j is in I j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d, and such that f (r) = 0.\n(2) For every map R \u2192 V , where V is a DVR, rV \u2286 IV . In other words, r\nhas order at least as large as IV under the valuation associated with V .\nThe elements satisfying these equivalent conditions form an ideal I \u2212 called the\nintegral closure of I.\nThe special part of the integral closure of I [Eps10] is defined when (R, m) is\nlocal and I \u2286 m. It consists of all r which satisfy a monic polynomial as in (1)\nsuch that the coefficient of xd\u2212j is in mI j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d. The special part of the\nintegral closure is an ideal containing mI and contained in I \u2212 but it typically does\nnot contain I.\nMore generally, for any ideal J of a Noetherian ring R we can define the J-special\nintegral closure I \u2212Jsp of I to consist of all elements r in R that satisfy an J-special\npolynomial over I: this means that the polynomial is monic of degree d \u2265 1 and\nthe coefficient of xd\u2212j is in JI j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d. We shall soon see that the condition\ndepends only on Rad(J), and not on J itself. Our main interest is in the cases\nwhere J = I or J = m.\nNote that while the integral closure of a Noetherian domain need not be Noetherian, it is still true that it is a Krull ring: principal ideals have only finitely many\nminimal primes, the localization at such a minimal prime is a DVR, and one has\nprimary decomposition for principal ideals. Cf. [Nag62, pp. 115-117 and Theorem\n(33.10) on p. 118].\nIf I = 0 or J = 0, then I \u2212Jsp is the ideal of nilpotent elements of R, and is (0)\nif R is a domain.\nTheorem 5.1. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian domain, let I and J be nonzero ideals\nof R, and let r \u2208 R. The following conditions are equivalent.\n(1) r is in the J-special integral closure of I.\n(2) There exists an integer n \u2265 1 such that rn \u2208 (JI n )\u2212 . In this case, all\nmultiples tn of n have the same property: in fact, rtn \u2208 (J t I tn )\u2212 .\n(3) There exists an integer n \u2265 1 such that for all maps R \u0592\u2192 V where V is a\nDVR then\nordV (r) \u2265 ordV (J)/n + ordV (I).\n(4) For all maps R \u0592\u2192 V where V is a DVR, ordV (r) \u2265 ordV (I), and the\ninequality is strict if ordV J > 0.\n(5) If R is a domain, I = (f1 , . . . , fh )R and J = (g1 , . . . , gk )R with the elements\nfi , gj all nonzero, it suffices that the condition in (4) hold when V is the\nlocalization of the normalization of R[I/fi ][J/gj ] at one of the minimal\nprimes of the fi , gj for all i, j and choices of the minimal prime. If J = I,\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n19\n\nwe may use instead the minimal primes of the fj in the normalizations of\nthe rings R[I/fi ].\nProof. The second statement in (2) is clear. (2) =\u21d2 (1) since the equation\nshowing integral dependence for rn on JI n may be viewed as an equation that r\nsatisfies, and this provides the J-special polynomial over I. We prove (1) =\u21d2 (3).\nSuppose (1) holds with a J-special polynomial over I of degree n. Then for some\nj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n,\nordV (rn ) \u2265 ordV (JI j ) + ordV (rn\u2212j )\nand so\nj ordV (r) \u2265 ordV (J) + j ordV (I)\nand\nordV (r) \u2265 ordV (J)/j + ordV (I).\nHence, we have\nordV (r) \u2265 ordV (J)/n + ordV (I),\nno matter what j is.\n(3) =\u21d2 (4) is clear, and (4) =\u21d2 (5) is clear.\nTherefore, the proof will be complete if we can show that (5) =\u21d2 (2). Choose a\nvalue of n so large that condition (3) holds with this value of n for all of the finitely\nmany valuation rings described in (5). Now consider any injection R \u0592\u2192 V where V\nis a DVR. Then IV is generated by the image of some fi , and JV is generated by\nsome gj . For these two elements, the map R \u0592\u2192 V factors R \u0592\u2192 R[I/fi ][J/gj ] \u0592\u2192 V\nand, hence, R \u0592\u2192 Sij \u0592\u2192 V , where Sij is the normalization of R[I/fi ][J/gj ]. We\nclaim that in Sij , rn \u2208 JI n Sij = gj fin Sij . Since Sij is a Krull domain, it suffices\nto see this after localizing at each of the minimal primes of gj fin Sij . Since each\nof these is a minimal prime of gj or fi , this produces one of the discrete valuation\nrings W for which we have assumed that\nordW (r) \u2265 ordW (J)/n + ordW (I).\nMultiplying by n gives the result we need. Since rn \u2208 JI n Sij , this continues to\nhold in V . But then rn \u2208 (JI n )\u2212 , as required.\nWhen J = I, both are generated by the image of some fi after expanding to V ,\nand so the map R \u0592\u2192 V factors R \u0592\u2192 R[I/fi ] \u0592\u2192 V , and the rest of the proof is the\nsame.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.2. For any Noetherian ring R with ideals I and J, r \u2208 R is in the\nJ-special integral closure of I if and only if for some n, rn \u2208 (JI n )\u2212 . This may be\ntested modulo every minimal prime P of R.\nThe J-special integral closure of I is an ideal, depends only on Rad(J), and lies\nbetween Rad(J)I and Rad(J) \u2229 I \u2212 .\nProof. Say the minimal primes of R are P1 , . . . , Ph . If rni \u2208 (JI ni )\u2212 mod Pi for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 h, and N is the product of the ni , by Theorem 5.1 (2) we have that\nrN \u2208 (JI N )\u2212 mod Pi for all i, and this implies rN \u2208 (JI N )\u2212 in R. If we have\nJ-special equations over I satisfied for r mod each Pi , the value of the product\nof these on r is nilpotent, and so a power of the product will be 0. Thus, the\nequivalence reduces to the domain case, where we already know it.\nIn the domain case, I \u2212Jsp is an ideal: this is true if either is 0. If not, we can use\n(3) to characterize the J-special integral closure. If r1 and r2 satisfy condition (3)\nwith integers n1 and n2 , their sum satisfies condition (3) with n = max{n1 , n2 },\n\n\f20\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nwhile closure under multiplication is obvious. In the general case, the J-special\nintegral closure is the intersection of the images of what one gets modulo various\nminimal primes.\nThe second statement in (2) shows that J-special integral closure is contained in\nJ t -special integral closure, and the opposite inclusion is obvious. It is clear that the\nspecial part of the integral closure contains JI, and we may replace J by Rad(J).\nIt is also obvious that I \u2212Jsp is contained in both Rad(J) and I \u2212 .\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.3. Let (R, m) be a local domain. An element r \u2208 R is in the special\npart of the integral closure of I iff for all R \u0592\u2192 V with V a DVR centered on m, if\nIV 6= 0 then ordV (r) > ordV (I).\nProof. Since ordV (m) will be positive, the condition is necessary. Because there are\nonly finitely many valuation rings needed in the test in part (5) of Theorem 5.1, we\ncan always choose a value of n that will work for all of these.\n\u0003\nThe inner integral closure of I is defined as the I-special integral closure of\nI. Instead of I \u2212Isp we write I>1 . This construction is developed to some extent\nin [HS06, Section 10.5] (from which we obtain our notation) and in [GV11, Section\n4]; some of our results in this section may overlap with the results in these two\nreferences. We emphasize that this is not a closure operation. It does not usually\ncontain I, but is contained in the integral closure of I. It may be thought of as\nthe \"inner\" part of the integral closure. Note that by part (c) of Proposition 5.5\nbelow, the inner integral closure of I is the same as the inner integral closure of\nI \u2212 , and by part (d) of Proposition 5.5, the ideal I>1 is itself integrally closed. The\nnotation I>1 agrees with the notation given in [HS06, Definition 10.5.3 on p. 206],\nwhere an infinite family of related notions (I>\u03b1 for all positive rational numbers \u03b1)\nis considered, but no name is given for I>1 .\nTheorem 5.4. Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R, and r \u2208 R. The\nfollowing conditions are equivalent, and characterize when r is in the inner integral\nclosure of I.\n(1) The element r satisfies a monic polynomial f (x) \u2208 R[x] of some degree d\nsuch that the coefficient of xd\u2212i is in I j+1 , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d.\n(2) There is an integer n such that rn is integral over I n+1 .\n(3) There is an integer n such that rn \u2208 I n+1 .\n(4) For every prime ideal P containing I, r/1 is in the special part of the\nintegral closure of IRP .\n(5) For every map R \u2192 V , where V is a DVR, such that IV is not 0 and not\nV , ordV (r) > ordV (I).\n(6) The condition in (5) holds for all V such that R \u2192 V kills a minimal prime\np of R.\n(7) If R is a domain, and I = (f1 , . . . , fh ) where the fi are nonzero, the condition in (5) holds for all V arising as the localization at a minimal prime\nof one of the fi in the normalization of one of the rings R[I/fi ].\n(8) If R is an excellent domain and every prime ideal is an intersection of\nmaximal ideals3 (e.g., if R is a finitely generated C-algebra), the condition\nin (5) holds for discrete valuations centered on a maximal ideal m of R.\n3i.e. R is a Hilbert ring.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n21\n\nProof. We already have (1) =\u21d2 (2) =\u21d2 (5) =\u21d2 (6) =\u21d2 (7). We can\nsee that (2) \u21d0\u21d2 (3) as follows. It suffices to show =\u21d2 : the converse is\nobvious. But if rn is integral over I n+1 then there exists h such that for all N ,\n(I n+1 + rn )N +h = (I n+1 )N +1 (I n+1 + rn )h\u22121 , so that rn(N +h) \u2208 I (n+1)(N +1) for all\nN . But if N > nh \u2212 h \u2212 1 we have that (n + 1)(N + 1) > n(N + h), as required.\nBecause the condition in (7) (and in part (5) of the preceding theorem) involves\nonly finitely many DVRs, we can choose n that works for these, and then the\npreceding theorem yields (1) and (2). Condition (4) and the preceding Corollary\nyield condition (5), since IV 6= V in (5) implies that V is centered on a prime\ncontaining I.\nIt remains only to prove (7), which is obviously necessary. When R is excellent,\nthe normalization Si of R[I/fi ] is finitely generated over R. Let V be one of the\nlocalizations of Si at a minimal prime of fj . Let v generate the maximal ideal of V .\nWe can choose a localization T0 of Si at one element such that v generates a prime\nideal in T0 . We can write r and fi as units of V times powers of v, say r = uv \u03bd ,\nfi = u\u2032 v \u03bc , where \u03bd > \u03bc. We may localize T0 further, but at finitely many elements,\nso that it contains u and u\u2032 . Call the resulting ring T . Then v is prime in T , and\nthe domain T /vT is excellent. It follows that there is a maximal ideal m of T /vT\nsuch that (T /vT )M is regular. The pullback M of m to T will be a maximal ideal\nof T containing v such that TM is regular and the image of v is a regular parameter.\nThe contraction of M to R is a maximal ideal because R is a Hilbert ring. The\nvaluation given by order with respect to powers of M will give the same result for\nthe orders of r and I as V .\n\u0003\nProposition 5.5. Let I be an ideal of the Noetherian ring R.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nIf W is a multiplicative system of R, (IW )>1 = (I>1 )W .\nIf S is integral over R, (IS)>1 \u2229 R = I>1 .\nIf I \u2286 J then I>1 \u2286 J>1 . If I \u2286 J \u2286 I \u2212 , then I>1 = J>1 .\nThe ideal I>1 is integrally closed.\n\nProof. For part (a), if rn \u2208 I n+1 RW , then for some w \u2208 W we have wrn \u2208 I n+1 ,\nand then (wr)n \u2208 I n+1 , which shows that wr \u2208 I>1 . The other implication is\ntrivial.\nFor (b), if r \u2208 R is such that rn is in the integral closure of I n+1 S, then rn is in\nthe integral closure of I n+1 . The other containment is obvious.\nThe first statement in (c) is obvious from condition (2) or (3) of Theorem 5.4.\nThe second statement is clear provided that we can show that an element r in the\ninner integral closure of I \u2212 is in the inner integral closure of I. But (I \u2212 )n+1 \u2286\n(I n+1 )\u2212 , and so if rn is in the former it is in the latter.\nPart (d) follows because condition (5) of Theorem 5.4 shows that I>1 is an\nintersection of valuation ideals. This fact also follows from [HS06, Proposition\n10.5.2 part (4)] coupled with the final remark in the paragraph following [HS06,\nDefinition 10.5.3].\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.6. Let R be a finitely generated C-algebra. Then I>1 \u2286 I cont .\nProof. Consider a polynomial for r as in condition (1) of Theorem 5.4, with indeterminate variable x. Suppose that the coefficient of xd\u2212j is a sum of tj terms, each\nthe product of j + 1 elements of I. We replace all tj (j + 1) elements of I involved\n\n\f22\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nby variables. This gives an equation F = xd + P1 xd1 + * * * Pd = 0 where Pj is homogeneous of degree j + 1 in tj (j + 1) variables, and all the variables from distinct\nPi , Pj are mutually disjoint. Consider the ring S defined by adjoining x and all the\nother variables to C and killing the polynomial F . In this ring, let J be the ideal\ngenerated by all variables other than x. The radical of J contains x as well. We\nhave a homomorphism S \u2192 R which takes x to r and such that JR \u2286 I. Thus, it\nsuffices to show that the image of x is in J cont in S. But S has an N-grading: we\ngive the variables occurring in Pj degree (d + 1)!/(j + 1), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d, and we give\nx degree (d + 1)!. Since x has a higher degree than any generator of J, the result\nfollows from Theorem 2.5\n\u0003\nIt follows that I>1 \u2286 I ax in an affine C-algebra. In fact this holds more generally.\nTo see this, first, we give the following useful lemma.\nLemma 5.7. Let (R, m, k) be a 1-dimensional complete Noetherian seminormal\nlocal ring. Then for any ideal J of R, we have m * J \u2212 \u2286 J.\nProof. First, note that it is enough to prove the lemma for a primary ideal. For let\nJ = Q1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Qt be a primary decomposition, and suppose the lemma holds for\n\u2212\nprimary ideals. Then mJ \u2212 \u2286 mQ\u2212\n1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 mQt \u2286 Q1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Qt = J.\nLet Li and Vi be as in the description given in Theorem 3.3. For each i, let ti be\na generator of the maximal ideal of Vi . We have Spec R = {p1 , . . . , pn , m}, where\npi is the kernel of the map R \u2192 Vi .\nIf J is pi -primary for some i, it follows from the minimality of pi and the fact\nthat R is reduced that J = pi . Then mJ \u2212 = mp\u2212\ni = mpi \u2286 pi = J.\nThus, we may assume J is m-primary. Then for each i, there is some integer\n1 \u2264 ei < \u221e such that JVi = tei i Vi . Hence,\nJ\u2212 =\n\nn\nM\n\ntei i Vi .\n\ni=1\n\nPick any i between 1 and n. Then from the structure of R, it follows that there\nP\nf\nis some element of the form c := utei i + j6=i vj tj j \u2208 J, where u is a unit of\nV , the vj \u2208 V , and the fj \u2265 ej . Then for a typical element vtiei +1 \u2208 tiei +1 Vi\n(where v \u2208 Vi ), we have u\u22121 vti \u2208 R, so that vtiei +1 = (u\u22121 vti )ci \u2208 J. Hence,\nLn\nmJ \u2212 = i=1 tiei +1 Vi \u2286 J.\n\u0003\nNext, we have the following theorem, which follows from Theorem 5.6 when R\nis a finitely generated C-algebra, but in fact holds in a more general setting as we\nsee below.\nTheorem 5.8. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring, and I an ideal. Then I>1 \u2286\nI ax .\nProof. Since the persistence property holds for both inner integral closure and axes\nclosure, we may assume that (R, m, k) is a complete local 1-dimensional seminormal\nring, in which case what we want to show is that I>1 \u2286 I. Pick Noetherian valuation\nrings (Vi , (ti ), Li ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,L\nas in Theorem 3.3. If I = R there is nothing to prove,\nn\nso we may assume I \u2286 m = i=1 ti Vi . For each i, either IVi = 0 or IViL\n= tei i Vi for\nn\n\u2212\n\u221e\nsome 1 \u2264 ei < \u221e. If we use the convention ti = 0, then we have I = i=1 tei i Vi ,\nwhere 1 \u2264 ei \u2264 \u221e for each i.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n23\n\nLn ei +1\nBy part (5) of Theorem 5.4, we have I>1 \u2286\nVi = mI \u2212 . But by\ni=1 ti\n\u2212\nLemma 5.7, we have mI \u2286 I, which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe next observe that I>1 = (I \u2212 )>1 , and so the operation that sends I to I + I>1\nis a closure operation in the sense of Definition 1.1.\nDefinition 5.9. For an ideal I, we let I \u266e := I + I>1 , the natural closure of I. If\nI = I \u266e we say that I is naturally closed. Evidently, if I \u2286 I1 \u2286 I \u2212 and I = I \u266e , then\nI1 = I1\u266e .\nBy a valuation of R we simply mean a map R \u2192 V where R is a discrete valuation\nring. It may have a kernel, even if R is a domain. If IV 6= 0 has order k > 0 call\nthe valuation ideal A arising from contraction of nk+1 the I-relevant valuation ideal\nof R \u2192 V . If IV = 0, we call the contraction of 0, i.e., Ker(R \u2192 V ), the I-relevant\nvaluation ideal of R \u2192 V .\nIf R is a domain and I is a nonzero ideal of R, then for every nonzero element\nf \u2208 I we may take the normalization S of the R[I/f ] and consider the discrete\nvaluation rings arising as localizations of S at a minimal prime of f S. There\nare only finitely many such valuation rings, and if R is excellent, they are small.\nFollowing standard terminology, we refer to these rings as the Rees valuation rings\nof I.\nIn the case where R is not a domain, we make the following conventions about the\nRees valuations of I. For every minimal prime P of R not containing I, we include\nthe Rees valuations of I(R/P ) among the Rees valuations for I. If P contains I,\nwe shall think of the fraction field \u03ba(P ) of R/P as a \"degenerate\" valuation ring,\nand we include the maps R \u2192 \u03ba(P ) as Rees valuations. The order of every element\nnot in P is 0, while the elements of P may be viewed as having order +\u221e.\nTheorem 5.10. Let R be Noetherian and I and ideal of R.\n(a) There are finitely many valuations R \u2192 (Vi , ni ) such that I>1 is the intersection of the I-relevant valuation ideals of these valuations. The Vi may\nbe chosen to be the Rees valuations.\n(b) I = I \u266e if and only if there are finitely many valuations R \u2192 (Vi , ni ) with\nI-relevant valuation ideals Ai such that \u2229i Ai \u2286 I. These valuations may be\nchosen to be the Rees valuations of I.\nProof. For part (a), we know that r \u2208 I>1 if and only if that holds modulo each\nminimal prime of I. Thus, it suffices to show that there are valuation ideals as\nspecified for every R/p and IR/p. We may thus reduce to the domain case. If\nI \u2286 p we take the relevant valuation ideal to be 0. We may localize at any height\none prime of the normalization of R/p and do this. Otherwise we use the valuation\nideals coming from the rings R[I/f ].\nThe \"only if\" part of (b) is obvious. For the \"if\" part, suppose that we have\n\u2229i Ai \u2286 I. To show that I = I \u266e , it suffices to show that I>1 \u2286 I. Let u \u2208 I. Then\nu \u2208 Ai for all i, and the result is obvious.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.11. Let I be an ideal of R and W a multiplicative system in R.\nThen (IW )\u266e = (I \u266e )W .\nProof. (IW )\u266e = IW + (IW )>1 = IW + (I>1 )W , by Proposition 5.5(a), but IW +\n(I>1 )W = (I + I>1 )W = (I \u266e )W .\n\u0003\n\n\f24\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nTheorem 5.12. Let R \u2192 S be a flat homomorphism of excellent Noetherian rings\nwhose fibers are geometrically regular. Let I be ideal of R. Then (IS)>1 = I>1 S,\nb or\nand (IS)\u266e = (I \u266e )S. In particular, if (R, m, K) is local, this holds if S is R\nS = R(t), the localization of the polynomial ring R[t] at mR[t].\nProof. The statement for natural closure is immediate from the statement for inner\nintegral closure. Evidently, I>1 S \u2286 (IS)>1 . To see the opposite inclusion, it will\nsuffice to show that for every I-relevant ideal B for a Rees valuation of I(R/p),\nwhere p is a minimal prime of R, BS is an I-relevant ideal for IS of a valuation on\nS. For I>1 is the intersecton of the ideals B, and the intersection of the ideals BS\nwill be (I>1 )S, and will also contain (IS)>1 .\nTo prove this, we may replace R \u2192 S by R/p \u2192 S/pS, which is still flat\nwith geometrically regular fibers. Thus, we may assume that R is a domain. Let\n(V, n) be a Rees valuation of I. Then V is essentially of finite type over R, since\nR is excellent, and so T = S \u2297R V is essentially of finite type over S, and is\nNoetherian and flat over V with geometrically regular fibers. It follows that T /nT\nis reduced. Let Q1 , . . . , Qs be the minimal primes of nT . Then every TQi is a\nvaluation ring, and Qi TQi = nTQi . Let h be the order of IV , so that IV = nh .\nThen (IS)TQi = (IV )TQi = nh TQi = Qhi TQi , for each i = 1, . . . , s. Hence, the\ncontraction Ai of Qh+1\nto S is an IS-relevant ideal for the valuation ring TQi .\ni\nConsequently, (IS)>1 \u2286 Ai .\nT\nTQi , \u2287 is clear.\nWe next show that T i Ai = BS. Since nh+1 maps into Qh+1\ni\nWe need to show that i Ai \u2286 BS. First observe that since (R/B) \u0592\u2192 V /nh+1 is\nto obtain that\ninjective and S is R-flat, we may apply S \u2297R\nh+1\n\u223c\nS/BS \u0592\u2192 (V /n\n) \u2297R S = T /nh+1 T\nis injective. Thus, nh+1 T lies over BS. Since V is a discrete valuation ring and\nV \u2192 T is flat with regular fibers, T is regular. (In fact, we only need that T is\nnormal.) Moreover, n is principal and so nh+1 T is a principal ideal generated by a\nT\n(h+1)\n,\nnon-zerodivisor. It follows that its primary decomposition is simply si=1 Qi\nh+1\nT , is also the\nsince Qi TQi = nTQi . Hence, BS, which is the contraction of n\nTs\n(h+1)\n.

Let R be a ring and let S be a finitely presented R-algebra that\nis smooth over R. Then for every ideal I of R, (IS)>1 = I>1 S and (IS)\u266e = I \u266e S.\nProof. The second conclusion follows from the first, and, for the first, it suffices\nto prove that (IS)>1 \u2286 I>1 S. First note that there is a subring R0 of R finitely\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n25\n\ngenerated over the prime ring \u039b in R and a finitely presented smooth R0 -algebra S0\nsuch that S \u223c\n= R \u2297R0 S0 , and that S is the union of the rings S1 = R1 \u2297R0 S0 as R1\nruns through all subrings of R finitely generated over R0 : these in turn are finitely\ngenerated over \u039b and, therefore, excellent. If f \u2208 (IS)>1 then we can choose such\nan R1 so that f \u2208 (I1 S1 )>1 , where I1 is an ideal of R1 generated by elements in\nI. But then R1 and S1 satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 5.12, and so we can\nconclude that f \u2208 (I1 )>1 S1 \u2286 I>1 S, as required.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.14. Let R be a Zh -graded ring, h > 0, and let I be a homogeneous\nideal with respect to this grading. Then I>1 and I \u266e are also homogeneous with\nrespect to this grading.\nProof. It suffices to prove this for I>1 . Although >1 is not a closure operation,\nDiscussion 2.9 applies: it is defined ring-theoretically, and will be stable under\nthe automorphisms \u03b8\u03b1 . The only issue in the proof is that R may not have sufficiently many units. However, the rings SN introduced in Discussion 2.9 are finitely\npresented, smooth, and faithfully flat over R, and the result now follows from Discussion 2.9, Proposition 5.13, and the fact that since SN is faithfully flat over R,\nI>1 S \u2229 R = I>1 .\n\u0003\n6. The ideal generated by the partial derivatives\nTheorem 6.1. Let S be a localization of R = C[x1 , . . . , xn ] at one element. Let\nf \u2208 R, and let J = (\u2202f /\u2202x1 , . . . , \u2202f /\u2202xn ).\n(a) For any nonconstant f \u2208 R and integer N there exists g \u2208 S such that\n(1 \u2212 gf )f is in the inner integral closure of J and, hence, the continuous\nclosure.\n(b) If f \u2208 Rad(J S) then f is in the inner integral closure of J S and hence in\nthe continuous closure of J S.\nProof. We first prove (b). Consider a valuation S \u2192 V centered on a maximal ideal\nM that contains J . Then we have SM \u2192 V , and f is also in M. We may assume\nthat M corresponds to the origin, and so we have \u03b8 : C[[x1 , . . . , xn ]] \u2192 L[[t]] for\nsome field L with C \u2286 L. Then \u03b8(f ) is in the maximal ideal of L[[t]] and is nonzero.\nBy the chain rule, its derivative is in J L[[t]]. The derivative has order exactly one\nless than that of \u03b8(f ). This shows that the order of f is strictly larger than the\norder of J .\nTo prove (a), let B = Rad(J ) : f . Then no maximal ideal can contain B + f R:\nwhen we localize at such a maximal ideal, the chain rule shows that for all valuations\ncentered on it, the order of f is larger than the order of J , and so f \u2208 J \u2212 \u2286\nRad(J ), which contradicts the fact that the maximal ideal contains Rad(J ) : f .\nThus, we can choose h \u2208 B such that that h + f g = 1, and so 1 \u2212 f g \u2208 B, and\nf (1 \u2212 f g) \u2208 Rad(J ). We can apply part (b) to the ring Rh where h = 1 \u2212 f g.\nHence, h has a power, also of the form 1 \u2212 f g, which multiplies f into the inner\nintegral closure of J .\n\u0003\n7. Naturally closed primary ideals are axes closed\nIn this section we prove that if I is a primary ideal of an excellent Noetherian\nring, then I = I ax iff I = I \u266e . This shows that for ideals primary to maximal ideals,\nnatural closure and axes closure agree. Moreover, in the case of an affine C-algebra,\n\n\f26\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nsince I \u266e \u2286 I cont \u2286 I ax , we have the corresponding result for continuous closure as\nwell. It then follows that for an unmixed ideal I of an affine C-algebras, I = I cont\nif and only if I = I ax .\nWe first extend the I-relevant terminology from Definition 5.9 as follows.\nDefinition 7.1. Let D be a Dedekind domain with a nonzero principal ideal tD\nwhere t is prime. Given a map R \u2192 D we say that A is the I-relevant associated\nwith (D, tD) if either ID = 0 and A = Ker(R \u2192 D) or ID = tk D and A is the\ncontraction of tk+1 D.\nThis is the same as saying that A is the I-relevant ideal of R \u2192 DQ , where\nQ = tD.\nWe need the following result, which is contained in [EH79, Corollary 1, p. 158].\nTheorem 7.2. Let R be a regular Noetherian ring, let P be a prime ideal of R,\nand let M by a family of maximal ideals of R containing P whose intersection is\nP , andTsuch that for all m \u2208 M, Rm /P Rm is regular. Let n be a positive integer.\nThen m\u2208M mn = P (n) , the n th symbolic power of P .\nCorollary 7.3. Let R, P and M be as in Theorem 7.2. Moreover, suppose that\nthe prime ideal P is prinicipal with generator \u03c0. Let n1 , . . . , nk be finitely positive\nintegers. Then the set of maximal ideals m in M such that \u03c0 ni \u2208 mni \u2212 mni+1 also\nhas intersection P . In particular, this set is non-empty.\nProof. By a straightforward induction on k, we reduce to the case where k = 1. We\nwrite n for n1 . Let f \u2208 R\u2212P . It suffices to show that there exists m \u2208 M such that\nf \u2208\n/ m and \u03c0 n \u2208\n/ mn+1 . Let g \u2208 R \u2212 P . Then there is an element of M that does\nnot contain g. It follows that the intersection of the\nT set N of maximal ideals in M\nthat do not contain f is also P . By Theorem 7.2, m\u2208N mn+1 = P (n+1) = \u03c0 n+1 R.\nTherefore, we can choose m \u2208 N such that \u03c0 n \u2208\n/ mn+1 .\n\u0003\nKey Lemma 7.4. Let (R, m, K) be an excellent local domain of dimension d \u2265 2\nwith infinite residue class field and let I be an m-primary ideal. Let f be a nonzero\nelement of I. Let S be the normalization of R[I/f ], and let R \u2192 V = SP be a Rees\nvaluation of I, where P is a minimal prime of f S. Let n denote the maximal ideal of\nV . Let IV have order h \u2212 1 \u2265 1, and let B be the contraction of the proper nonzero\nideal nh of V to R. Let g1 , . . . , gh \u2208 R \u2212 {0}, and let ni = ordV (gi ). Then there\nexists an algebra T finitely generated over S by adjunction of fractions, a prime\nideal Q of T of height d \u2212 1 such that T /Q is a Dedekind domain, and a principal\nheight one prime \u03c0T /Q of T /Q such that IT /Q = \u03c0 h\u22121 T /Q, BT /Q = \u03c0 h (T /Q),\nand the image of gi in T /Q is a unit times \u03c0 n . In particular, by including a given\nnonzero element r of R among the gi , we may choose Q so that r has nonzero image\nin T /Q.\nProof. By the dimension formula, S/P is an affine K-algebra of dimension d \u2212 1.\nSince SP is regular, we can localizate at one fraction of S \u2212 P to produce S1 that\nis regular, and we can localize at one element of S \u2212 P to produce a localization\nS2 such that S2 /P S2 is regular as well. We may also localize so that P = yS2 is\nprincipal. We replace S by S2 and drop the subscript. By Corollary 7.3 we can\nchoose a maximal ideal m of S2 containing P so that the orders of a finite set of\ngenerators of I, and of B, as well as of g are all the same with respect to the\nm-adic valuation on Sm as they are in V . We may extend y to a set of elements\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n27\n\ny1 = y, y2 , . . . , yd in m that generate mSm . We may localize at one element of\nS \u2212 m and then assume that these elements generate m. Consider the leading forms\nof gi and the various generators of I and B in grm S. After a linear change of\ngenerators over K (which is infinite) that fixes y and replaces each yi for i > 1 by\nyi + ci yi , we may assume that all of these leading forms have a term that is a scalar\ntimes a power of y: the exponent on y is the order. The ideal Sm /(y2 , . . . , yd )Sm is\na regular domain in which the image of y generates a prime ideal. This will remain\ntrue after we localize at one element of S \u2212 m. This localization is T , and we may\ntake Q = (y2 , . . . , yd )T .\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.5. Let R be an excellent ring, and let I be an m-primary ideal of\nR, where m is maximal and R/m is infinite. R \u2192 V be a Rees valuation with\nI-relevant ideal A. Let r be a non-zerodivisor in R. Then there exist finitely many\nsurjections R \u2192 Di such that Di is a one-dimensional Dedekind domain that is\nfinitely generated over the residue class field K = R/m and nonzero primes ti Di\nsuch that A is the intersection of the I-relevant ideals Bi of these maps. Moreover,\nthe surjections may be chosen in such a way that the image of r in every Di is\nnonzero.\nProof. If the Rees valuation has kernel p we may work with R/p, IR/p and A/p.\nThe image of r in R/p is not 0. Thus, we may assume that R is a domain, and that\nr is a nonzero element of R. Consider all finite intersections of ideals B containing\nA of the type described (including the condition that the image of r be nonzero in\nevery Di ). Since R/A has DCC, one of these is minimum. If it is not A, choose g\nin it that is not in A. By the Key Lemma, we can construct B so that the image\nof r in the corresponding Dedekind domain is not 0 and so that it contains A but\nnot g, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.6. Let I be an m-primary naturally closed ideal of an excellent ring\nR, where m is maximal and R/m is infinite. Let r \u2208 R be a non-zerodivisor. Then\nthere is a radical ideal J \u2286 I such that R/J has pure dimension one, the image of\nr is not a zerodivisor in R/J, and I(R/J) = I/J is naturally closed. Moreover,\nI/J is primary to m/J in R/J.\nProof. Pick Ai that are I-relevant from Rees valuation rings and whose intersection\nis contained in I. For each Ai pick Bij as in Corollary 7.5 whose intersection is\nwithin Ai , and let qi be the kernel of the map onto a Dedekind domain of dimension\none that is used in construction Bij . This may be done so that r is not in any of\nqi . Take J = \u2229i,j qij . Then R/J has the required property.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.7. Let R be a one-dimensional excellent Noetherian reduced ring, and let\nS be the seminormalization of R. Let I be an ideal of R whose minimal primes are\nall height one maximal ideals and such that I is naturally closed. Then IS \u2229 R = I.\nProof. Suppose that f \u2208 (IS \u2229 R) \u2212 I. By replacing f by a multiple we may assume\nthat I :R Rf is a maximal ideal m of R. If we replace R by Rm and S by Sm we still\nhave that f \u2208\n/ IRm , while natural closure commutes with localization. It follows\nthat we may assume that (R, m, K) is local of dimension one. Consider the local\nextension rings R1 of R with R \u2286 R1 \u2286 S and choose R1 maximal in this family\nsuch that f is not in the natural closure if IR1 , which will still be primary to the\nmaximal ideal of R1 . Thus, we may replace R by R1 , and I by the natural closure\nof IR1 , and we still have a counterexample. If R1 = S we are done. Hence, there\n\n\f28\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nis some element u \u2208 S \u2212 R such that u2 , u3 \u2208 R. Note that R[u] = R + Ru. By\nreplacing u by a multiple we may assume that the annihilator of the image of u in\n(R + Ru)/R is a prime ideal of R. Since u is in the total quotient ring of R, it is\nmultiplied into R by a non-zerodivisor, and it follows that we may assume that the\nannihilator is a height one maximal ideal, which must be m. Since u3 = (u2 )u \u2208 R,\nwe must have u2 \u2208 m, and it follows likewise that u3 \u2208 m.\nHence, R[u] = R+Ru is local with maximal ideal m+Ru. Let J = IR[u] = I+Iu.\nWe shall show that Iu \u2286 I>1 \u2286 I, since I = I \u266e First note that since u2 \u2208 m, some\npower of u is in I, say uk \u2208 I. Then (Iu)k = I k uk \u2286 I k+1 , as required. Since\nevery element of Iu is in R, this shows that Iu \u2286 I>1 . Hence, J = I. Now suppose\nf \u2208 J + J>1 , where the calculation of J>1 is in R[u]. Then f = v + w where\nv \u2208 J = I. Then f \u2212 v \u2208 I>1 R[u] \u2229 R. By (5.5b), f \u2212 v \u2208 I>1 , and so f \u2208 I \u266e , a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.8. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring. Let I be an ideal primary to\na prime ideal P such that I is naturally closed. Then I is axes closed. Moreover,\nif r \u2208 R is not a zerodivisor, and f \u2208\n/ I ax , then there is a map R \u2192 A, where A is\na one-dimensional excellent seminormal ring, which may further be assumed to be\ncomplete local, such that f \u2208\n/ IA and the image of r is a non-zerodivisor in A.\nProof. Let f \u2208 I ax \u2212 I \u266e . Since natural closure commutes with localization by\nProposition 5.11, we may replace R by RP : f is not in IRP since I is primary to\nP . By the persistence of axes closure, f \u2208 (IRP )ax . We have therefore constructed\na new counterexample in which P is maximal. We revert to our original notation\nand call the ring R, but we assume that P = m is a maximal ideal. Second, we\nmay replace R by R(t), by Theorem 5.12. Hence, we may assume without loss of\ngenerality that the residue field K is infinite. The element r is still a non-zerodivisor.\nBy Corollary 7.6, we can preserve the fact that f is in the axes closure but not\nthe natural closure of I while passing to a reduced local ring of pure dimension one\nthat is a homomorphic image of R, and such that the image of r is not a zerodivisor\nin this ring. Thus, we need only consider the issue in dimension one. Let S be the\nseminormalization of R. Then IS \u2229 R = I by Lemma 7.7, and so f \u2208\n/ IS, which\nshows that f \u2208\n/ I ax by Definition 4.3. Note also that r remains a non-zerodivisor\nin S. Finally, we may replace S by a suitable completed localization.\n\u0003\nWe also note:\nTheorem 7.9. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring. Then the following conditions on an ideal I are equivalent:\n(1) I is axes closed.\n(2) I is an intersection of primary naturally closed ideals.\nProof. By Proposition 4.11, we already know that I is axes closed if and only if\nit is an intersection of primary axes closed ideals, and for primary ideals, being\nnaturally closed coincides with being axes closed by Theorem 7.8.\n\u0003\nDiscussion 7.10. Although we have not been able to determine whether axes\nclosure commutes with localization, we can show that it commutes with smooth\nbase change in certain cases. Before stating our results, we recall the notion of\nintersecton flatness from [HH94a], where it is introduced just before the statement\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n29\n\nof (7.18). An R-module S (typically, S will be an R-algebra here) is intersectionflat or \u2229-flat if S is flat and for every finitely generated R-module M and every\ncollection of submodules {M\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of M , the obvious injection\n\\\n\\\nS \u2297R ( M\u03bb ) \u0592\u2192 (S \u2297R M\u03bb ).\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nis an isomorphism. The \u2229-flat modules include R and are closed under arbitrary\ndirect sum and passing to direct summands and therefore include the projective\nR-modules. In [HH94a] it is observed that if R is complete local and R \u2192 S is flat\nlocal then S is \u2229-flat over R, using Chevalley's theorem, and that R[[x]], where R\nis Noetherian and x denotes a finite string of variables, is \u2229-flat over R.\nIf S is an \u2229-flat R-algebra that is faithfully flat, where R is Noetherian, and\nW is a multiplicative system consisting of elements of S that are nonzerodivisors\non S/P S for every prime ideal P of R (which implies that no element of W is in\nmS for m maximal in R), then by Lemma (5.10) of [AHH93], W \u22121 S is \u2229-flat. In\nparticular, the localization of a polynomial ring over R at a multiplicative system\nof polynomials each of which has the property that its coefficients generate the unit\nideal is \u2229-flat over R.\nTheorem 7.11. Let R \u2192 S be a flat homomorphism of excellent Noetherian rings\nwith geometrically regular fibers.\n(a) If I is an unmixed ideal of R that is axes closed, then IS is axes closed.\n(b) If, moreover, S is \u2229-flat, then for every I of R, (IS)ax = I ax S. In particular, this holds when S is a localization of a polynomial ring in finitely many\nvariables over an excellent ring R at a multiplicative system consisting of\npolynomials each which has the property that its coefficients generate the\nunit ideal in R.\nProof. For part (a), note that the primary components of I are axes closed, and\nsince finite intersection commutes with flat base change it will suffice to prove\nthe result when I is primary, say to P . Then IS is naturally closed in S by\nTheorem 5.12. If IS is unmixed, its primary components will also be naturally\nclosed and so axes closed, and it will follow that IS is axes closed. But R/I has a\nfinite filtration by torsion-free R/P -modules. It follows that the associated primes\nof S/IS are the same as those of S/P S. Since R/P is a domain and R/P \u2192 S/P S\nis flat with geometrically regular fibers, S/P S is reduced.\nax\nFor part (b), note that by Theorems 7.9\nT and 7.8, I is an intersection of axes\nax\nclosed primary ideals J\u03bb . Then I S = \u03bb J\u03bb S, and so it suffices to show that\nevery J\u03bb S is axes closed, which follows from part (a).\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.12. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring, let I be an ideal of R,\nand let r \u2208 R be a non-zerodivisor. In testing whether f \u2208 I ax in R, it suffices to\nconsider maps h : R \u2192 A where A is one-dimensional, seminormal, and h(r) is\nnot a zerodivisor in A. Moreover, A may be chosen to be complete local.\nProof. If f \u2208\n/ I ax , by Proposition 4.11, we may choose a primary axes closed ideal\nJ such that I \u2286 J and f \u2208\n/ J. The result then follows from Theorem 7.8.\n\u0003\nWe do not know whether axes closure commutes with localization. This would\nbe true if an axes closed ideal remained axes closed after localization. The following\nresult sheds light on the problem.\n\n\f30\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nTheorem 7.13. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring, and let I be an axes closed\nideal. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) I is a finite intersection of primary naturally closed ideals (and so has an\nirredundant primary decomposition in which the primary components are\nall naturally closed ideals).\n(2) I is a finite intersection of primary axes closed ideals (and so has an irredundant primary decomposition in which the primary components are all\naxes closed ideals).\n(3) For every associated prime ideal P of I, IRP is axes closed in RP .\n(4) For every multiplicative system W in R, IW \u22121 R is axes closed in W \u22121 R.\nProof. Note in (1) and (2) that if one can express I as a finite intersection of\nnaturally closed or axes closed primary ideals, one may obtain an irredundant\nprimary decomposition as usual by intersecting those primary to the same prime\nand omitting terms that are not needed.\nThe first two conditions are equivalent, since a primary ideal is naturally closed\nif and only if it is axes closed in an excellent ring by Theorem 7.8. We have that\n(1) =\u21d2 (4), because primary naturally closed ideals remain primary naturally\nclosed ideals or become the unit ideal when one localizes. Since (4) =\u21d2 (3) is\nevident, it suffices to show that (3) =\u21d2 (2). Assume (3). We use induction on\nthe number of associated primes of I. If there is only one associated prime, I is\nprimary to it, and the result is clear.\nWe next reduce to the local case. Let P be an associated prime of I. Then IRP\nis axes closed in RP , by hypothesis, and if we can prove the result for RP and IRP ,\nwe may write IRP as a finite intersection of axes closed primary ideals in RP . The\ncontractions of these ideals to R will be finitely many axes closed primary ideals. If\nwe intersect all of these as P varies, we obtain I, for if f \u2208\n/ I then f has a multiple\nnot in I such that the annihilator of (I + Rf )/I is an associated prime of I. Thus,\nf /1 \u2208\n/ IRP , and so it fails to be in at least one of the primary components A of\nIRP , and f will not be in the contraction of A to R.\nHence, it suffices to prove the result when R\n= (R, P ) is local and P is an\nS\u221e\nassociated prime of I. Let J denote the ideal t=1 (I : P t ), the saturation of I\nwith respect to P . Then J is axes closed, by Proposition 4.10. If we localize at\nany prime of R other than P , I and J have the same expansion. Thus, I and J\nhave the same associated primes, except that P is an associated prime of I and\nnot J, and so J has fewer associated primes than I. Thus, J remains axes closed\nwhen we localize at any of its associated primes. By the induction hypothesis, J is\na finite intersection of primary axes closed ideals. We know that J/I is killed by\na power of P , and so has finite length. Let S be the set of ideals contained in J\nthat are finite intersections of primary axes closed ideals that contain I. Note that\nwe have shown J \u2208 S. S is a directed family by \u2287, since it is closed under finite\nintersection. Since J/I has finite length, we can choose J0 \u2208 S such that the length\nof J0 /I is minimum. We can complete the proof by showing that J0 = I. But if\nf \u2208 J0 \u2212 I, by Proposition 4.11 we can choose a primary axes closed ideal Q that\ncontains I and not f . Then Q \u2229 J0 \u2208 S, and Q/I is strictly contained in J0 /I and,\ntherefore, of smaller length, a contradiction. Thus, J0 = I, as required.\n\u0003\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n31\n\nCorollary 7.14. For a primary ideal I in an affine C-algebra, I = I ax , I = I cont\nand I = I \u266e are equivalent. Moreover, in an affine C-algebra, an unmixed ideal is\ncontinuously closed if and only if it is axes closed.\nProof. We know that the continuous closure lies between the natural closure and\nthe axes closure. Hence, the first statement follows at once from Theorem 7.8. If I is\nunmixed and continuously closed, each primary component is a primary component\nfor a minimal prime of I, and is continuously closed as well by Corollary 2.3. Hence,\neach primary component is axes closed, and an intersection of axes closed ideals is\naxes closed.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.15. Let I be an ideal of an excellent ring R such that R/I is zerodimensional. Then the natural closure of I is the same as the axes closure of I.\nMoreover, if R is an affine C-algebra, the continuous closure of I is the same as\nwell.\nProof. All ideals containing I satisfy the same condition, and are therefore unmixed.\nSince an ideal containing I is naturally closed if and only if it is axes closed, these\ntwo closures agree. The final statement follows from the fact that in an affine\nC-algebra, I \u266e \u2286 I cont \u2286 I ax .\n\u0003\nProposition 7.16. If R is a finitely generated C-algebra, m is a maximal ideal\nand I is an m-primary ideal, then I cont is the contraction of (IRm )cont to R. This\nmeans that if f \u2208 R, then f \u2208 I cont if and only if f /1 \u2208 (IRm )cont , i.e., if and\nonly if the germ of f at the origin is in the expansion of I to the ring of germs of\ncontinuous C-valued functions at the origin.\nProof. It is clear that J = I cont is contained in the contraction of (IRm )cont to R.\nTo complete the argument, it will suffice to show that J, which is an m-primary\ncontinuously closed ideal, is contracted from the ring T of germs of continuous Cvalued functions at x \u2208 X = Max Spec(R) (with the Euclidean topology), where\nx corresponds to m. Because J = J cont , we know that J = J ax by Corollary 7.15\njust above. Let f \u2208 R \u2212 J. Then by part (7) of Theorem 4.1 we can choose\n\u03b8 : R \u2192 (A, n) such that f \u2208\n/ JA, where \u03b8 is a C-homomorphism, A is an analytic\nring of axes over C, and \u03b8\u22121 (n) = m. By Lemma 3.5 of [Bre06], JA is contracted is\ncontracted from T . Hence, f \u2208\n/ JT . Thus, J is contracted from T , as required. \u0003\nTheorem 7.17. Let R be a reduced excellent ring. R is seminormal if and only if\nevery principal ideal generated by a non-zerodivisor is axes closed.\nProof. We first prove \"if.\" Suppose that g is an element of the total quotient ring of\nR such that g 2 , g 3 \u2208 R. We must show that g \u2208 R. Since g is in the total quotient\nring of R, we can choose f , a non-zerodivisor in R, such that gf \u2208 R. We claim that\ngf is in the axes closure of f . We use the test for being in the axes closure provided\nby Theorem 7.12. Suppose that we have any ring map \u03b8 : R \u2192 S such that S is an\nexcellent seminormal one-dimensional ring and u := \u03b8(f ) is a non-zerodivisor. Let\nw := \u03b8(f g). Consider the element v = w/u of the total quotient ring of S. We have\nu2 v 2 = (uv)2 = w2 = \u03b8(f g)2 = \u03b8(f 2 )\u03b8(g 2 ) = u2 \u03b8(g 2 ).\nSince u2 is a non-zerodivisor in the total quotient ring of S, it follows that \u03b8(g 2 ) =\nv 2 , and in particular that v 2 \u2208 S. Similar computations show that \u03b8(g 3 ) = v 3 , so\n\n\f32\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nthat v 3 \u2208 S as well. Since S is seminormal, it follows that v \u2208 S. So we have\n\u03b8(f g) = w = uv \u2208 uS = \u03b8(f )S.\nThen by choice of \u03b8 and Theorem 7.12, it follows that f g \u2208 (f R)ax = f R. That is,\nthere is some r \u2208 R such that f g = f r. Since f is a non-zerodivisor, it follows that\ng = r \u2208 R, so that R is seminormal.\nNow assume instead that R is excellent seminormal. We may assume that\ndim R \u2265 2, since otherwise every ideal of R is axes closed by Proposition 4.5. Suppose some element g \u2208 R is in the axes closure of f R, where f is a non-zerodivisor.\nLet S be the integral closure of R. Since S is a product of finitely many normal\ndomains (the normalizations of the quotients of R by its various minimal primes),\nevery principal ideal of S is integrally closed, hence axes closed, so g \u2208 f S. That\nis, g = hf for some h \u2208 S. If we can show that h is in the seminormalization\nof R in S, which is R, then we are done. To this end we use the criterion from\nProposition 3.1(1). For the remainder of the proof we may change notations: we\nreplace R by RP (where P is an arbitrary prime ideal of R), and so assume that\n(R, P, K) is local, and we replace S by SP , which is the integral closure of RP .\nThen S is semilocal, and we denote the maximal ideals of S by Q1 , . . . , Qn . We\nwant to show that h is in R + Q1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Qn . Let ci denote the image of h in Li ,\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, where Li = S/Qi . Note that we may identify K with a subfield of Li for\nevery i. Note that Li is a finite algebraic extension of K for every i. We shall show\nthat all of the ci are in K, and that they are all equal. If r \u2208 R represents their\ncommon value, then h \u2212 r is in all of the Qi , which yields the desired conclusion.\nFor each Qi , choose a prime ideal qi of S contained in Qi and maximal with\nrespect to not containing f . Then Qi /qi is a minimal prime of f (S/qi ), and so\nQi /qi has height one. Let pi = Qi \u2229 R. Then R/pi is a local domain and since\nR/pi \u0592\u2192 S/qi is module-finite, we must have that dim(R/pi ) = 1, by the dimension\nformula [Mat86, Theorem 15.6]. The image of f is a non-zerodivisor in both R/pi\nand (S/qi )Qi , and so is a non-zerodivisor in both of their completions. We have\nan induced map of the completions Ci \u2192 Di , which are one-dimensional reduced\ncomplete local rings. Choose a minimal prime of Di . Its contraction to Ci will not\ncontain the image of f , and so is also a minimal prime. We get an induced map\nof quotient domains C i \u0592\u2192 Di . In each, the image of f is nonzero. Let Vi be the\nnormalization of Di ; then Vi is a complete local discrete valuation domain whose\nresidue class field is an extension of Li and contains K.\nLet Wi denote the seminormalization of C i . Since Vi is normal, the normalization\nof C i may be constructed as a subring of Vi , and we may view Wi \u2286 Vi . Then Wi is\na one-dimensional seminormal ring, and we have a map R \u0589 R/pi \u0592\u2192 Ci \u0589 C i \u0592\u2192\nWi \u2286 Vi . Let Wi denote the subring of Vi consisting of all elements with image in\nK modulo the maximal ideal of Vi . Then C i \u2286 Wi , and whenever a \u2208 Vi is such\nthat a2 , a3 \u2208 Wi , one has that a \u2208 Wi as well. Thus, Wi \u2286 Wi .\nWe shall show ci \u2208 K, using that the image of g is in f Wi . We have a commutative diagram\n\u03b2\n\nS \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03b1\n\nVi\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nR \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Wi\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n33\n\nwhere the vertical maps are inclusions. Then \u03b1(g) = \u03b2(g) = \u03b2(f h) = \u03b2(f )\u03b2(h) =\n\u03b1(f )\u03b2(h). Since \u03b1(g) \u2208 \u03b1(f )Wi (which holds because g is in the axes closure of\nf R), and since \u03b1(f ) is a non-zerodivisor on Vi , it follows that \u03b2(h) \u2208 Wi . This\nimplies that \u03b2(h) \u2208 Wi , and so its residue ci is in K.\nFinally, suppose that we have ci and cj in K for i 6= j. We shall show ci = cj .\nLet Vi and Vj be as above. Each is a complete discrete valuation domain whose\nresidue class field is an algebraic extension of Li and, hence, of K. Enlarge Vi to\na complete discrete valuation domain Vi whose residue class field is the algebraic\nclosure \u03a9 of K. Thus, there is a K-isomorphism \u03b8 between the residue class fields\nof Vi and Vj . Let F be the field in question. Let A = Vi \u00d7\u03b8 Vj be the pullback of\nthe surjection Vi \u00d7 Vj \u0589 F \u00d7 F along the diagonal embedding F \u0592\u2192 F \u00d7 F . By\nTheorem 3.3, A is an excellent local one-dimensional seminormal ring. We have\nmaps \u03b7i : S \u2192 Vi \u2286 Vi and (\u03b7i , \u03b7j ) therefore maps S \u2192 Vi \u00d7 Vj . It is clear that the\nimage of R lies in A, since \u03b8 is a K-isomorphism. Hence, we have a commutative\ndiagram:\n\u03b2\n\nS \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Vi \u00d7 Vj\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 .\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03b1\n\nR \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nA\nwhere the vertical maps are inclusions. Once again, \u03b1(g) = \u03b2(g) = \u03b2(f h) =\n\u03b2(f )\u03b2(h) = \u03b1(f )\u03b2(h), and since \u03b1(g) \u2208 \u03b1(f )A and \u03b1(f ) is a non-zerodivisor on\nA (and hence also on Vi \u00d7 Vj , which is the normalization of A), we must have\n\u03b2(h) \u2208 A. This implies that the residues of h correspond under \u03b8, and since these\nare in K and \u03b8 is a K-isomorphism, they must be equal.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.18. Let R be a reduced affine C-algebra, and let f be a non-zerodivisor\nof R. Then (f R)cont = (f R)ax = f S \u2229 R, where S is the seminormalization of R.\nIn particular, if S is seminormal and f is a non-zerodivisor, f S is both continuously\nclosed and axes closed.\nProof. By Theorem 7.17, f S is axes closed and, consequently, continuously closed\nas well. Hence, (f R)ax \u2286 (f S)ax \u2229 R = f S \u2229 R. By Proposition 3.2, (f R)cont =\n(f S)cont \u2229R, and since f S is axes closed, (f S)cont = f S, so that (f R)cont = f S \u2229R.\nThis shows that (f R)ax \u2286 (f R)cont , and since we always have the opposite inclusion,\nit follows that all three of (f R)cont , (f R)ax , and f S \u2229 R are equal.\n\u0003\n8. Multiplying by invertible ideals and rings of dimension 2\nIn this section we prove that continuous closure and axes closure agree in locally\nfactorial affine C-algebras of dimension 2. In particular, this holds for the polynomial ring in two variables over C. In \u00a79 we give an example which shows that they\ndo not agree in the polynomial ring in three variables over C. In order to prove the\nmain result of this section, we need some preliminary results.\nLemma 8.1. Let # be a closure operation (see Definition 1.1) on R. Suppose\nthat for any two ideals I, J or R, I # J # \u2286 (IJ)# . Suppose further that for any\nnon-zerodivisor r \u2208 R and any ideal J such that J = J # , we have rJ = (rJ)# .\nLet I be an ideal of R that is locally free of rank one. Then for every ideal J of R,\nI(J # ) = (IJ)# . In particular, if I is locally free of rank one, then I = I # .\n\n\f34\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nProof. Evidently, I(J # ) \u2286 I # J # \u2286 (IJ)# , and so it suffices to show that (IJ)# \u2286\nI(J # ). Since the latter contains IJ, it suffices to show that the latter is closed.\nWe may replace J by J # , and so assume that J = J # , and we want to prove that\nIJ is closed. Since I is projective of rank one, it is an invertible ideal, and we\nmay choose an ideal I \u2032 such that I \u2032 I = rR, where r is a non-zerodivisor.\nThen\n\u0001\n#\n#\n\u2032\n#\n\u2032\n#\nI \u2032 (IJ)# \u2286 (I \u2032 IJ)# = (rJ)\n=\nr(J\n)\n=\n(I\nI)J\n=\nI\nI(J\n)\n.\nMultiplying\nby I\n\u0001\n\u0001\nthen yields that r (IJ)# = r I(J # ) . Since r is a non-zerodivisor, it follows that\n(IJ)# = I(J # ). The final statement is the case where J = R.\n\u0003\nTheorem 8.2. Let X be a closed affine algebraic set over C, and let R = C[X].\nLet I be an ideal that is locally free of rank one, and let J be any ideal. If R is\nseminormal, then (IJ)cont = I(J cont ).\nProof. By Lemma 8.1, Proposition 2.4, and Corollary 7.18, we may assume that I =\nrR, where r is a non-zerodivisor in R. Also by Proposition 2.4, r(J cont ) \u2286 (rJ)cont .\nNow suppose that u \u2208 (rJ)cont \u2286 (rR)cont . Since R is seminormal, we know from\nCorollary 7.18 that rR is continuously\nclosed, and so we may write u = rf for some\nPn\nf \u2208 R. Then rf = u = i=1 gi rfi (where f1 , . . . , fn is a generating set for the\nidealP\nJ) for some g1 , . . . , gn \u2208 C(X). Since r is not a zerodivisor in C[X], we have\nn\nf = i=1 gi fi as well.\n\u0003\nTheorem 8.3. Let R be a seminormal excellent Noetherian ring. Let I be an ideal\nof R that is locally free of rank one and let J be any ideal of R. Then (IJ)ax =\nI(J ax ).\nProof. By Lemma 8.1, Lemma 4.7, and Theorem 7.17, we reduce at once to the\ncase where I = rR is generated by a non-zerodivisor r. Since r(J ax ) \u2286 (rJ)ax ,\nit suffices to prove the other conclusion, which follows at once if r(J ax ) is axes\nclosed. Therefore, we may replace J by J ax , and it will suffice to show if J is\naxes closed, then rJ is axes closed. Since rR is axes closed by Theorem 7.17, it\nsuffices to show that if rf \u2208 (rJ)ax then f \u2208 J ax . If we have a counterexample, by\nTheorem 7.12, there is a map h : R \u2192 A, where A is a one-dimensional excellent\nseminormal ring, h(r) is a non-zerodivisor in A, and h(f ) is not in h(J)A. Then\nh(rf ) = h(r)h(f ) \u2208\n/ h(r)h(J)A = h(rJ)A, and so rf \u2208\n/ (rJ)ax , a contradiction. \u0003\nDiscussion 8.4. Let R be a locally factorial domain. When R is factorial, every\nnonzero ideal A is uniquely the product of a principal ideal (which may be R) and\nan ideal of height at least two (which may also be R: the height of the unit ideal is\n+\u221e). The principal ideal is generated by the greatest common divisor of any given\nset of generators of A, which is unique up to a unit multiplier, and is the same as\nthe greatest common divisor of all elements of A. When R is only locally factorial,\nwe may say instead that every nonzero ideal A factors uniquely as the product of\nan ideal that is locally free of rank one and an ideal of height at least two. One\ncan perform the factorization uniquely in every local ring of R, since the local rings\nare factorial. But one can actually carry this out on a cover by open affines: it is\nclear that the factorizations on two affines will be the same on the overlaps, since\nthe factorization is unique in every local ring of R. To get the factorization on a\nneighborhood of a prime Q, consider the height one primes P1 , . . . , Pk of R that\ncontain A and are contained in Q. Each Pi becomes principal when expanded to\nRQ . Localize R at one element f \u2208\n/ Q so that each Pi Rf is principal, say \u03c0i Rf ,\nand so that the only height one primes of Rf that contain ARf are the Pi Rf .\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n35\n\nSuppose that ARPi = \u03c0iai RPi . Then ARf factors as rJ where r = \u03c01a1 * * * \u03c0kak ,\nsince comparing primary decompositions shows that A \u2286 rRf . The factor J is not\ncontained in any height one prime of Rf , and so this is the desired factorization.\nIf, moreover, R has dimension at most two, then when we factor A in this way,\nthe second factor J is either the unit ideal or is contained only in maximal ideals\nof height two, and is unmixed in the sense of having no embedded primes.\nTheorem 8.5. Let R be a domain of dimension two that is a locally factorial affine\nC-algebra. Then axes closure and continuous closure agree for R.\nProof. The result is immediate from the preceding discussion, Theorem 8.2, Theorem 8.3, and Corollary 7.15\n\u0003\n9. A negative example and a fiber criterion for exclusion from the\ncontinuous closure\nWe begin with an inclusion lemma for axes closure.\nLemma 9.1. Let R be an excellent Noetherian ring. Let I be an ideal and I \u2212 the\nintegral closure of I. Let P \u2208 Spec R and J := (P * I \u2212 ) \u2229 (I : P ). Then J \u2286 I ax .\nProof. Let f : R \u2192 (A, m) be a ring homomorphism, where A is a complete local\none-dimensional seminormal ring. If f (P ) * m, then JA \u2286 (I : P )A = IA. Thus,\nwe may assume that f (P ) \u2286 m. In that case, the image of J is contained in m(IA)\u2212 .\nBut by Lemma 5.7, m(IA)\u2212 \u2286 IA. Hence, JA \u2286 IA, as required.\n\u0003\nExample 9.2. In the polynomial ring C[u, v, x], the element uvx is in the axes\nclosure of I = (u2 , v 2 , uvx2 ) but not the continuous closure.\nThe first statement follows from Lemma 9.1, applied to the ideal I and the prime\nideal P = (u, v, x), since uv \u2208 I \u2212 .\nNow suppose that uvx is in the continuous closure of I, say\nuvx = f u2 + gv 2 + huvx2 ,\nwhere f, g, h are continuous functions of u, v, x in that order. Let a = h(0, 0, 0).\nChoose a constant c 6= 0 such that ch(0, 0, c) 6= 1: this is possible since xh(0, 0, x) \u2192\n0 * a = 0 as x \u2192 0. Substitute x = c in the displayed equation. Then\ncuv = f0 u2 + g0 v 2 + h0 c2 uv,\nwhere the subscript indicates the function of u, v obtained by substituting x = c in\n2\nf, g, h respectively. The\n\u0001 new equation involves only u, v. The function c \u2212 h0 c has\nvalue c 1 \u2212 ch(0, 0, c) 6= 0 at the origin in the u, v-plane, and so has a continuous\ninverse s on a neighborhood U of the origin. Then\nuv = F u2 + Gv 2 ,\nwhere the coefficients F := sf0 and G := sg0 are continuous functions defined on\nU . But this yields a contradiction. To see this, let A := {(u, v) | u = v} \u2229 U and\nB := {(u, v) | u = \u2212v} \u2229 U . On the set A \\ 0, we have F + G = 1, so that by\ncontinuity, F (0, 0) + G(0, 0) = 1. But on B \\ 0, we have F + G = \u22121, so that\nF (0, 0) + G(0, 0) = \u22121 (again by continuity), whence 1 = \u22121, an absurdity.\n\n\f36\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nGeneralizing the counterexample. If R = C[X] for an affine algebraic set X\nand x \u2208 X, recall from Discussion 2.6 that we write I cont,x for the set of elements of\nthe local ring Rx of C[X] at x that are continuous linear combinations of elements\nof I on some Euclidean neighborhood of x in X. This is the contraction to Rx of\nthe expansion of I to the ring of germs of continuous (in the Euclidean topology)\nfunctions on X at x.\nSuppose that B \u2192 R is a C-homomorphism of finitely generated C-algebras\nsuch that B, R are reduced. Let Y = Max Spec(B) and X = Max Spec(R). Thus,\ny\nwe have a map \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y . If y \u2208 Y , let R denote the coordinate ring of the\nreduced fiber over y, i.e., if my is the maximal ideal of B corresponding to y, then\ny\ny\nR = (R/my R)red . Max Spec(R ) may be identified with the fiber Xy = \u03c0 \u22121 (y),\ny\ny\nand R with the ring of regular functions on \u03c0 \u22121 (y). We have a surjection R \u0589 R\nfor every y, which may be thought of as restriction of regular functions from X to\ny\nXy . If g \u2208 R, we write g y for the image of g in R .\nTheorem 9.3 (fiber criterion for exclusion from continuous closure). Let B, R be\nas in the paragraph above, and let notation be as in that paragraph. Suppose that\nf, g \u2208 R and I, J \u2286 R are ideals. Suppose that:\n(1) f \u2208\n/ J cont in R.\n\u03c0(x) cont,x\n\n(2) {x \u2208 X : g \u03c0(x) \u2208\n/ (IR\ncont\nThen gf \u2208\n/ (I + gJ)\nin R.\n\n)\n\n} is dense in X in the Euclidean topology.\n\nBefore giving the proof, we show how the example from the beginning of this\nsection can be analyzed using this criterion. Let B = C[x] \u2286 C[x, u, v] = R. Let\nf = x, g = uv, I = (u2 , v 2 )R, and J = x2 R. Note that f \u2208\n/ J cont in R. The\nfibers are simply the rings obtained by specializing x to a complex constant, and\nall of them may be identified with C[u, v] \u2286 R. In this case, uv \u2208\n/ (u2 , v 2 )cont,x\n2\n2\nin all fibers C[u, v] for all x. To see this, observe that (u , v ) is primary to the\nmaximal ideal (u, v) of C[u, v]. It is clear that uv \u2208\n/ (u2 , v 2 )\u266e , which is the same as\n2\n2 cont\n2\n2 ax\n(u , v )\n= (u , v ) by Corollary 7.15, and we may apply Proposition 7.16 to\nconclude that uv \u2208\n/ (u2 , v 2 )cont,(0,0) . Hence, xuv \u2208\n/ (u2 , v 2 , x2 uv)cont in R.\nProof of the fiber criterion. Let u1 , . . . , uh generate I and v1 , . . . , vk generate J.\nSuppose that\nk\nh\nX\nX\n\u03b2j gvj ,\n\u03b1i ui +\nfg =\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nPk\nwhere the the \u03b1i and \u03b2j are continuous. Then \u03b3 = f \u2212 j=1 \u03b2j vj is a continuous\nfunction on X that does not vanish identically, since f \u2208\n/ J cont . Then U = \u03b3 \u22121 (C \u2212\n{0}) is a nonempty subset of X that is open in the Euclidean topology. Hence, it\nmust meet {x \u2208 X : g \u03c0(x) \u2208\n/ (IR\n\n\u03c0(x) cont,x\n\n\u03c0(x)\n\n)\n\n}. Thus, we may choose x \u2208 X such that\n\n\u03c0(x) cont,x\n\n\u03b3(x) 6= 0 (since x \u2208 U ) and g\n\u2208\n/ (IR\n)\n. But then there is a Euclidean\nneighborhood of x on which \u03b3 does not vanish, so that 1/\u03b3 is a continuous function\non this neighborhood, and, if y = \u03c0(x), on the intersection of this neighborhood\nwith Xy we have\nh\nX\n\u03b1i (y) y\ngy =\nui ,\n\u03b3(y)\ni=1\ny\n\nwhich shows that g \u2208 (IR )cont,x , a contradiction.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n37\n\n10. Mixed natural closure and continuous closure for monomial\nideals in polynomial rings\nWe know that for an ideal I of a finitely generated reduced C-algebra, I \u266e \u2286\nI cont \u2286 I ax , and that if I is unmixed, the conditions that it be naturally closed,\ncontinuously closed, and axes closed are all equivalent. It turns out that when\nI is mixed, even if it is a monomial ideal, a naturally closed ideal need not be\ncontinuously closed and a continuously closed ideal need not be axes closed.\nMixed natural closure is intended to make up for the following defect of natural\nclosure: when f \u2208 R, it is possible that f g is not in the natural closure of f I even\nthough g is in the natural closure of I. (Note that it is obvious that if g is in the\ncontinuous closure of I, then f g is in the continuous closure of f I.)\nIn fact, in the polynomial ring C[u, v, x] the ideal (u3 x, v 3 x) is naturally closed\nbut not continuously closed, since u2 v 2 x is in the continuous closure. The point\nis that u2 v 2 is in the natural closure of (u3 , v 3 ), and so it is in the continuous\nclosure. It follows that u2 v 2 x is in the continuous closure of (u3 x, v 3 x). To see that\n\u03bc = u2 v 2 x is not in the natural closure, note that for I monomial both I \u266e and I>1\nare monomial. Thus, it suffices to show that \u03bc \u2208\n/ I and \u03bc \u2208\n/ I>1 . The first is clear.\nThe second is true since it is obviously true even after we localize at the prime ideal\n(x).\nWe note also that in C[u, v, x] the ideal (u2 , v 2 , uvx2 ) is continuously closed but\nnot axes closed: see Example 9.2 of the preceding section.\nIn this section, we first define a modified version of natural closure for ideals I in\nmix\nany ring, which we refer to as mixed natural closure. We let I \u266e\ndenote the mixed\nmix\nnatural closure of I. If I = I \u266e , we say that I is MN-closed. It will turn out that\nmix\nI \u266e \u2286 I \u266e , that a primary ideal is MN-closed if and only if it is naturally closed.\nmix\nmix\nThe definition will force it to be true that if f J \u2286 I and u \u2208 J \u266e , then f u \u2208 I \u266e .\nWe shall eventually use the fiber criterion to prove that for monomial ideals in\npolynomial rings over C, continuous closure always equals mixed natural closure.\nDefinition 10.1. We shall say that an ideal I of a ring R is MN-closed if whenever\nf J \u2286 I and u \u2208 J \u266e , then\u0001 f u \u2208 I. An obviously equivalent condition is that\nfor all f \u2208 R, f (I :R f )\u266e \u2286 I. Since f may be taken to be 1, an MN-closed\nideal is naturally closed. An intersection of MN-closed ideals is clearly MN-closed.\nmix\nWe define the mixed natural closure of I, denoted I \u266e , to be the intersection of\nall the MN-closed ideals containing I, which is evidently the smallest MN-closed\nmix\nideal containing I. It is easy to see that u \u2208 I \u266e\nif and only if (\u2020) there are finite\nsequences of ideals I = I0 , I1 , . . . , Ih , J0 , . . . , Jh\u22121 and finite sequences of elements\nu1 , . . . , uh and f1 , . . . , fh in R such that u \u2208 Ih and such that for every i, 0 \u2264 i < h,\nfi+1 Ji \u2286 Ii , ui+1 \u2208 Ji\u266e , and Ii+1 = Ii + fi+1 ui+1 R. We note that we may take\nthe ideals Ji to be finitely generated, and if ui \u2208 Ji\u266e there is a subring R0 of R\nfinitely generated over Z and containing ui , and an ideal J0 of R0 generated by\nmix\nfinitely many elements of Ji such that ui \u2208 J0\u266e . It follows, for example, that I \u266e\nis\nmix\nthe union of the ideals (I \u2229 S)\u266e\n(in S) as S runs through any directed family of\nsubrings of R whose union is R. In particular, we may let S run through subrings\nof R finitely generated over Z.\nP\nmix\nWe give a third description of I \u266e . Let A1 (I) := A(I) := f \u2208R f (I :R f )\u266e .\n\u0001\nRecursively, define An+1 (I) = A An (I) . Note that I \u2286 I \u266e \u2286 A(I) since we may\n\n\f38\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\ntake f = 1. Then it is easy to see I = I \u266e\nS\u221e\nmix\nI \u266e = n=1 An (I).\n\nmix\n\nif and only if I = A(I) and that\n\nThe following two Propositions are immediate from the definition and discussion\nabove.\nProposition 10.2. Let (R\u03bb , I\u03bb ) be a directed family of rings and ideals (so that the\nmap R\u03bb \u2192 R\u03bc takes I\u03bb into I\u03bc ). Let (R, I) be the direct limit, where I \u2286 R is an\nideal.

If I \u2286 J are ideals of R, then I \u266e\n\u2286 J\u266e\nand (I \u266e )\u266e\n=\n\u266emix\nI\n\u2287 I. In other words, mixed natural closure is a closure operation in the sense\nof Definition 1.1.\n\u0003\nWe also have:\nmix\n\nProposition 10.4. If I \u2286 R, I \u266e \u2286 I \u266e . If # is any closure operation on ideals\nof R such that I \u266e \u2286 I # for all ideals I \u2286 R and f * (I # ) \u2286 (f I)# for all f \u2208 R and\nmix\nmix\nmix\nall ideals I \u2286 R, then I \u266e\n\u2208 I # for all I. In particular, I \u266e\n\u2286 I, I \u266e\n\u2286 I ax\nax\n\u266emix\ncont\ncont\nwhenever I is defined, and I\n\u2286I\nwhen I\nis defined. Consequently, if\ncont\n\u266emix\nI =I\n, then I = I\n. Moreover, if f is a non-zerodivisor in a seminormal ring,\nthen f R is MN-closed.\nProof. The statements are immediate except for the last statement. This statement\nreduces to the case where R is finitely generated over the integers and, hence,\nexcellent. The result now follows from Theorem 7.17, since f R is axes closed. \u0003\nmix\n\nProposition 10.5. If R \u2192 S is a homomorphism and I is an ideal of R, then I \u266e\nmix\nmaps into (IS)\u266e\nin S. That is, mixed natural closure is persistent. Hence, if J is\nMN-closed in S, its contraction to R is MN-closed in R. If W is any multiplicative\nmix\nsystem in R, the mixed natural closure of IW \u22121 S in W \u22121 S is I \u266e W \u22121 S.\nProof. The first statement follows at once from the recursive construction of the\nelements in the mixed natural closure and the fact that natural closure is persistent,\nmix\nand the second statement is immediate from the first. The fact that I \u266e W \u22121 S \u2286\nmix\n(IW \u22121 S)\u266e\nis a special case of persistence. For the converse, we use the final\nmix\nconstruction of I \u266e\nin Definition 10.1. It suffices to show that A(IW \u22121 S) \u2286\n\u22121\nW A(IS). This follows at once because for all f \u2208 S and w \u2208 W ,\nIW \u22121 S :W \u22121 S (f /w) = IW \u22121 S :W \u22121 S (f /1) = (IS :S f )W \u22121 S;\nmoreover, localization commutes with natural closure (see Proposition 5.11) and\nsum of ideals.\n\u0003\nmix\n\nCorollary 10.6. Let I \u2286 R and u \u2208 R. Then u \u2208 I \u266e\nif and only if for every\nmix\nprime (respectively, maximal) ideal m of R, u/1 \u2208 (IRm )\u266e .\n\u0003\nProposition 10.7. If I is primary to a prime ideal P of R, then I = I \u266e\nonly if I = I \u266e .\n\nmix\n\nif and\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n39\n\nmix\n\nProof. It suffices to show that if I = I \u266e then I = I \u266e . For this we must show that\nif f J \u2286 I and u \u2208 J \u266e , then f u \u2208 I. The condition that u \u2208 J \u266e can be expressed in\nterms of finitely many elements of J and R with certain equations holding among\nthem. Therefore, we can choose a subring R0 of R that is finitely generated over\nZ that contains u, f , and these elements. Let I0 be the contraction of I to R0 , J0\nthe contraction of J, and let P0 be the contraction of P . Then it is still true that\nI0 is primary to P0 , that I0 is naturally closed, that f J0 \u2286 I0 , and that u is in the\nnatural closure of J0 in R0 . It will suffice to show that f u \u2208 I0 in R0 . Therefore,\nit suffices to consider the case where R is a finitely generated algebra over Z. In\nparticular, we may assume without loss of generality that R is excellent.\nThe result is now immediate from Theorem 7.8 and Proposition 10.4, for we\nhave I = I \u266e for a primary ideal implies I = I ax as well in the excellent case, and\nmix\nI \u266e \u2286 I ax = I.\n\u0003\nProposition 10.8. Let J, I be ideals of the ring R and let f \u2208 R. Suppose that\nmix\nmix\nI = I \u266e . Then f J \u2286 I implies f * (J \u266e ) \u2286 I.\nmix\n\nProof. If u \u2208 J \u266e\nthen there are sequences of ideals and elements as in condition\n(\u2020) of Definition 10.1 such that J is successively enlarged by one additional generator\nat a time until one reaches an ideal containing u. It will suffice to show that each of\nthe successive enlargements Ji of J has the property that f Ji \u2286 I. Since the base\nstep of the induction is simply that f J \u2286 I, it will suffice to show that if f Ji \u2286 I\nand Ji+1 = Ji + Rgv, where there is an ideal A of R and g \u2208 R such that gA \u2286 Ji\nand v \u2208 A\u266e , then f gv \u2208 I. Since f gA \u2286 f Ji \u2286 I, the result follows at once from\nmix\nthe fact that I = I \u266e .\n\u0003\nRemark. If an ideal I is graded or multigraded, the same holds for its closure or\nanother ideal derived from it in many instances. This is true for I cont by Proposition 2.10, I>1 and I \u266e by Proposition 5.14, as well as for I ax by Proposition 4.14. In\nparticular, in each of these cases, if I is a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring over\nmix\na field, so is I cont , I>1 , I \u266e and I ax . This is also true of I \u266e\nif the ring contains an\ninfinite field. We conjecture that this hypothesis is unnecessary.\nProposition 10.9. Let R be a Zh -graded ring, h > 0, and let I be a homogeneous\nideal with respect to this grading. Assume that R contains an infinite field. Then\nmix\nI\u266e\nis graded. If R is a polynomial ring over a ring A, then the MN-closure of\nevery monomial ideal is a monomial ideal. In this later case, if I is an ideal of A\nthat is MN-closed, then IR is MN-closed.\nProof. All of the statements but the last are immediate from the Discussion 2.9.\nFor the final statement, by a direct limit argument, we may assume that the number\nof variables is finite: say R = A[x1 , . . . , xh ]. Let F be a polynomial in the mixed\nnatural closure of IR. It suffices to show that each term a\u03bc of F , where \u03bc is\nmix\nmonomial in the xi , is such that a \u2208 I. Since (IR)\u266e\nis multigraded, we have that\nmix\na\u03bc is in (IR)\u266e . There is a unique A-homomorphism R \u2192 A that maps all the\nvariables to 1. Since mixed natural closure is persistent by Proposition 10.5, the\nimage of a\u03bc, which is a, is in the mixed natural closure of I, which is I.\n\u0003\nRemark. By Discussion 2.9, mixed natural closure preserves Zh -gradings whenever\nthe ring contains arbitrarily large families of units such that the difference of any two\ndistinct elements is also a unit. We conjecture that the results of Proposition 10.9\n\n\f40\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nhold without any hypothesis on R. However, we have not been able to prove in\ngeneral that (\u2217) if I is MN-closed in A, then IA[x] is MN-closed in the polynomial\nring A[x]. (Of course, if one knows this for one variable one gets the result for\narbitrary sets of variables.) If we simply knew this fact, it would imply that mixed\nnatural closure commutes with Zh -gradings in general. To see this, suppose that\nmix\nR is Zh -multigraded and that F \u2208 I \u266e\nfor a graded ideal I. By Discussion 2.9, if\ns is a sufficiently large\npositive\ninteger,\nt\n1 , . . . , ts are new indeterminates of degree\nQ\nQs\n(0, . . . , 0), and g = i=1 ti 1\u2264j<k\u2264s (tj \u2212 tk ), then each component F\u03bb of F is in\nthe mixed natural closure of IS, where S = R[t1 , . . . , ts ][1/g]. Since mixed natural\nclosure commutes with localization by Proposition 10.5, there is an integer N > 0\nsuch that g N F\u03bb is in the mixed natural closure of IR[t1 , . . . , ts ]. Let J be the\nmixed natural closure of I in R. If we know (\u2217), we can conclude that when g N F\u03bb\nis viewed as a polynomial in the ti , every coefficient is in J. Hence, we have the\ndesired result if some coefficient of g N F\u03bb is F\u03bb . It is therefore sufficient to note\nthat for lexicographic order with t1 > * * * > tn , the highest order term in g (and\nQs\nQs\n\u0003\nhence in g N ) has coefficient 1 (this term is ( i=1 ti ) j=1 tjs\u2212j ).\nLemma 10.10. Let R be a polynomial ring over C in variables x1 , . . . , xn . Let\nI1 be a naturally closed ideal primary to the homogeneous maximal ideal m1 in\nR1 = C[x1 , . . . , xk ] and suppose that\n(#) \u03bd is a monomial in I1 :R1 m1 such that I1 + \u03bdR1 is naturally closed in R1 .\nLet J be a continuously closed monomial ideal of R2 = C[xk+1 , . . . , xn ]. Then\nI1 R + \u03bdJR is continuously closed in R.\nProof. The continuous closure will be monomial. Since \u03bd is in the integral closure\nof I1 , I1 + \u03bdR1 is naturally closed and primary in R1 (or, if \u03bd = 1, it is all of R1 ),\nand so its expansion to R is either R or a primary naturally closed ideal. Hence,\nits expansion to R is continuously closed. It follows that the continuous closure of\nI1 + \u03bdJ must have the form I1 + \u03bdJ \u2032 R, where J \u2032 \u2287 J is a monomial ideal of R2\n(when \u03bd is multiplied by any variable in R1 , the product is in I1 R by hypothesis).\nLet f be a monomial in J \u2032 \u2212 J such that f \u03bd \u2208 (I1 + JR)cont . Let B = R2 .\nLet g = \u03bd. We apply the fiber criterion Theorem 9.3 of the preceding section.\nThe fiber over a point of B is simply the result of specializing the xj for j > k\nto complex constants given by the point. Thus, all of the fibers may be identified\nwith R1 , and the image of g = \u03bd is simply \u03bd. In this case, \u03bd \u2208\n/ I1cont,v in all\nfibers R1 for all v in Max Spec(R). To see this, observe that I1 is primary to the\nmaximal ideal (x1 , . . . , xk )R1 of R1 . We have that \u03bd \u2208\n/ I1 = I1\u266e , which is the same\nax\ncont\nas I1\n= I1 by Corollary 7.15, and we may apply Proposition 7.16 to conclude\ncont,(0,...,0)\nthat \u03bd \u2208\n/ I1\n. But then f \u2208\n/ I1 R + \u03bdJR by Theorem 9.3.\n\u0003\nDefinition 10.11. Let K be any field, and let R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a polynomial\nring over K. We shall say that an ideal I of R is MN-basic if there exist, for some\npositive integer k, mutually disjoint nonempty subsets S1 , . . . , Sk of the variables,\nmonomial ideals I1 , . . . , Ik such that for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, Ij is naturally closed and\nprimary to the homogeneous maximal ideal mj of Rj = K[xt : xt \u2208 Sj ], and for\neach j, where 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1, there is a monomial \u03bcj such that (#j ) \u03bcj \u2208 Ij :Rj mj\nand Ij + \u03bcj Rj is naturally closed; moreover,\n(\u2020)\n\nI = (I1 + \u03bc1 I2 + \u03bc1 \u03bc2 I3 + * * * + \u03bc1 \u03bc2 * * * \u03bck\u22121 Ik )R.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n41\n\nNote that if k = 1 this simply means that I is a naturally closed primary monomial\nideal. An alternative recursive definition is the following. We allow among the MNbasic ideals the primary naturally closed monomial ideals and those ideals obtained\nby the following recursive rule. If R1 and R2 are polynomial subrings of R generated\nby mutually disjoint subsets of the variables, I1 is a naturally closed monomial ideal\nprimary to the homogeneous maximal ideal m1 of R1 , \u03bc1 is a monomial of R1 such\nthat (#1 ) \u03bc1 \u2208 I1 :R1 m1 and I1 + \u03bc1 R1 is naturally closed, and J is an MN-basic\nideal in R2 , then (I1 + \u03bc1 J)R is an MN-basic ideal of R.\nWe shall say that an MN-basic ideal as above is maximal MN-basic for the\nmonomial \u03bc if S1 , . . . , Sk is a partition of all of the variables {x1 , . . . , xn } and if\nthere exists \u03bck \u2208 Rk such \u03bc = \u03bc1 * * * \u03bck and and for all i, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, Ij is maximal\namong naturally closed mj -primary ideals in Rj that do not contain \u03bcj .\nRemark. Let K be any field, let R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a polynomial ring, and let\nR1 = K[x1 , . . . , xk ] with homogeneous maximal ideal m1 . Let I1 be m1 -primary\nand naturally closed. Suppose that \u03bd \u2208 I1 \u2212 I1 . Then it is automatic that condition\n(#) from Lemma 10.10 holds, i.e., that \u03bd \u2208 I1 :R1 m1 and that I1\u2032 = I1 + \u03bdR1 is\nnaturally closed. The first part of the condition holds because m1 = Rad(I1 ), so\nthat m1 \u03bd \u2286 Rad(I1 )I1 \u2286 (I1 )>1 \u2286 I1 , and the second because (I1\u2032 )>1 \u2286 (I1 )>1 =\n(I1 )>1 \u2286 I1 \u2286 I1\u2032 . Also note that in the definition \u03bd can be 1, but only if I1 = m1 .\nFinally, note that if k = 1, the condition (#) holds precisely when I1 = xa+1\nfor\n1\na \u2208 N and \u03bc1 = xa1 .\nFrom the recursive version of MN-basic monomial ideals and Lemma 10.10 we\nhave at once:\nTheorem 10.12. If R is the polynomial ring C[x1 , . . . , xn ], every MN-basic monomial ideal is continuously closed.\n\u0003\nCorollary 10.13. Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and let R be the polynomial\nmix\nring K[x1 , . . . , xn ]. Then for every MN-basic monomial ideal I, I \u266e = I.\nProof. R is the directed union of the rings K0 [x1 , . . . , xn ] where K0 runs through\nall subfields of K finitely generated over Q. It therefore suffices to prove the result\nfor a field K that is finitely generated over Q. Any such field K is isomorphic to\na subfield of C, and so there is no loss of generality in assuming that K \u2286 C. The\ngiven MN-basic ideal I, expanded to S = C[x1 , . . . , xn ], is obviously still MN-basic.\nHence, IS is continuously closed by the preceding result, and so IS is MN-closed\nby Proposition 10.4. Hence, IS \u2229 R = I is MN-closed by Proposition 10.5.\n\u0003\nRemark. We conjecture that the result just above and the result just below hold\nfor every field K, not only those of characteristic 0.\nIn Theorem 10.15 below we show that MN-closed monomial ideals maximal with\nrespect to not containing a given monomial are maximal MN-basic monomial ideals.\nIt will be convenient to have the following result:\nLemma 10.14. Let K be a field of characteristic 0, let R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be\nmix\npolynomial ring. Let \u03bc be a monomial. Let I be a monomial ideal with I \u266e\n=I\nsuch that \u03bc \u2208\n/ I. Let S be the set of variables that do not occur in \u03bc, and let\nmix\nJ = I + (xj : xj \u2208 S). Then J \u266e\n= J and \u03bc \u2208\n/ J. Hence, a monomial ideal I\nmix\nwhich is maximal with respect to the conditions that I \u266e\n= I and \u03bc \u2208\n/ I contains\nall variables that do not occur in \u03bc.\n\n\f42\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nProof. After renumbering we may assume that x1 , . . . , xk occur in \u03bc, so that S =\n{xk+1 , . . . , xn }. Consider the K-algebra homomorphism R \u2192 R1 = K[x1 , . . . , xk ]\nthat fixes xj for j \u2264 k and kills xj for j \u2265 k + 1. The image I1 of I in R1 is the\nmonomial ideal spanned over K precisely by those monomials in I that are in R1 .\nmix\n= I1 in R1 , for if \u03bd \u2208\n/ I1 were in the mixed natural closure of\nWe claim that I1\u266e\nmix\nI1 in R1 , then \u03bd would be in I \u266e\n= I, since I1 R \u2286 I (we may expand using the\nmix\ninclusion R1 \u2286 R). This shows that J \u266e = J, for J is the contraction of I1 under\nthe surjection R \u2192 R1 . The final statement is now clear.\n\u0003\nTheorem 10.15. Let R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a polynomial ring over a field K of\ncharacteristic 0. Then a monomial ideal I \u2286 R is MN-closed if and only if it is\nan intersection of MN-basic monomial ideals. Moreover, these may be taken to be\nmaximal MN-basic monomial ideals.\nProof. Let \u03bc be a fixed monomial and let I be an MN-closed monomial ideal that\ndoes not contain \u03bc. Evidently, I can be enlarged to a maximal MN-closed monomial\nideal that does not contain \u03bc. Consequently, it will suffice to show that if I is a\nmaximal MN-closed monomial ideal for \u03bc, then it is maximal MN-basic monomial\nideal for \u03bc. We shall prove this by induction on n. If \u03bc = 1, then the only possible\nchoice of I is the homogeneous maximal ideal, and this is maximal MN-basic for 1.\nHenceforth, we assume that \u03bc 6= 1.\nWe next handle the case where all of the xi occur in \u03bc.\nFor each monomial \u03b1 = xa1 1 * * * xann \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ], let h(\u03b1) = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208\nNn . Consider the convex hull C of points of Nn corresponding to all monomials in I\ntogether with h(\u03bc). h(\u03bc) must be a boundary point of C, or else \u03bc would be in I>1 .\nBy a hyperplane in Rn we mean the translate of a vector subspace of dimension\nn \u2212 1. We may choose a supporting hyperplane of C that contains h(\u03bc). That is,\nthere is a hyperplane through h(\u03bc) such that C lies entirely in one of the closed\nhalf-spaces it determines. There is a nonzero real linear form L over R and c \u2208 R\nsuch that this hyperplane is defined by the equation L = c. Let y1 , . . . , yn be real\nvariables, and renumber the yi so that y1 , . . . , yk are the real variables that have\nnonzero coefficients in L: at least one coefficient is nonzero.\nThus, we may assume that the equation of the hyperplane is m1 y1 +* * * mk yk = c,\nwhere the mi \u2208 R \u2212 {0}.\nBy multiplying by \u22121 if necessary, we may assume that c \u2265 0. We may assume\nthat all the coefficients mi are positive. (To see this, note that all points with\nsufficiently large coordinates represent elements in I and will lie on one side of this\nhyperplane. If mi is positive (respectively, negative), choose a large value N \u2208 N\nfor the yj , j 6= i, and a very large positive integer value B for the value of mi . The\nvalue of L = m1 y1 + * * * + mk yk will be > c (respectively, < c) for B \u226b 0. Thus, if\nthere are coefficients with different signs, not all points with large coordinates are\non the same side of the hyperplane.) Thus, we may assume that all the mi have\nthe same sign. By multiplying by \u22121 we may assume that all of them are positive.\nNote that L evaluated at h(\u03bc) or h(\u03bd1 ) is c (the value of L only depends on the first\nk entries of the vector). Since h(\u03bc) has no nonzero entries, c > 0. Write \u03bc = \u03bc1 \u03b8,\nwhere \u03bc1 involves x1 , . . . , xk and \u03b8 involves the other variables.\nLet I1 \u2286 K[x1 , . . . , xk ] = R1 be generated by all monomials \u03bb except \u03bc1 in\nx1 , . . . , xk such that the value of L at h(\u03bb) is \u2265 c. Note that I1 is primary to\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n43\n\n(x1 , . . . , xk ): since each coefficient of L is positive, the functional will be > c on\nN ei , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, when N \u226b 0.\nMoreover, I1 + \u03bc1 R1 is integrally closed: the set of exponent vectors contains\nall lattice points in its convex hull because it is the intersection of a half-space, the\nfirst orthant, and the set of lattice points. In particular, it is naturally closed. It\nis also the case that I1 contains xi \u03bc1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k: the value of L is evidently \u2265 c\nfor each of these, and each of these is different from \u03bc1 . We also claim that I1 is\nnaturally closed. It suffices to show that \u03bc1 is not in the natural closure, and for\nthis it suffices to see that \u03bc1 \u2208\n/ (I1 )>1 . But if \u03bct1 \u2208 I1t+1 then th(\u03bc1 ) is the \u0001sum of\nt + 1 values of h on points of I1 . When we apply L, we find that tL h(\u03bc1 ) is the\nsum of t + 1 real numbers, each of which is \u2265 c. This implies that tc \u2265 (t + 1)c, a\ncontradiction.\nMoreover, I1 R + \u03bc1 R is the ideal of R generated by all monomials in R on which\nthe value of L is \u2265 c. Clearly, I \u2286 I1 R + \u03bdR: given any monomial in I, the value\nof L on the associated vector is \u2265 c, and this value depends only on that part\nof the monomial involving x1 , . . . , xk : the latter must be in (I1 , \u03bd)K[x1 , . . . , xk ].\nThe monomials in I that are not in I1 R must be monomials of the form \u03b1\u03b2 where\n\u03b1 \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xk ] and \u03b2 \u2208 K[xk+1 , . . . , xn ]. Since they are in I, the value of the\nfunctional on h(\u03b1) must be \u2265 c which means that \u03b1 \u2208 I unless \u03b1 = \u03bd. Thus,\nI \u2286 I1 R + J0 \u03bdR, where J0 \u2286 K[xk+1 , . . . , xn ] contains those monomials whose\nproduct with \u03bd is in I. \u03b8 cannot be in the mixed natural closure of J, or else\n\u03bc = \u03bd\u03b8 will be in the mixed natural closure of \u03bdJR \u2286 I. Thus, we may enlarge\nJ0 to a maximal mixed naturally closed ideal J of K[xk+1 , . . . , xn ] maximal with\nrespect to not containing \u03b8.\nBy the induction hypothesis we have that J is a maximal MN-basic monomial\nideal of K[xk+1 , . . . , xn ] maximal with respect to not containing \u03b8. It follows that\nI1 R + JR is a maximal MN-basic ideal for \u03bc = \u03bc1 \u03b8. Since I is contained in this\nideal, I must be equal to I1 + JR.\nThis completes the treatment of the case where all of the xi occur in \u03bc. In the\ngeneral case, by renumbering, suppose that x1 , . . . , xh are the variables that do not\noccur in \u03bc. Giving a maximal monomial MN-closed ideal I such that \u03bc \u2208\n/ I is\nequivalent to give such an ideal A for \u03bc in K[xh+1 , . . . , xn ] and then enlarging it\nto include x1 , . . . , xh , by Lemma 10.14. The enlarged ideal will still be maximal\nMN-basic: if I1 is the initial primary ideal in the representation (\u2020) of A as in\nDefinition 10.11, one can simply enlarge I1 to contain x1 , . . . , xh .\n\u0003\nWe now come to the motivating result for this section:\nTheorem 10.16. For a monomial ideal I in the polynomial ring C[x1 , . . . , xn ],\nmix\nI cont = I \u266e .\nmix\n\n\u2286 I cont . Thus, it will suffice to show that\nProof. We observed earlier that I \u266e\n\u266emix\nI\nis continuously closed. But by Theorem 10.15, it is an intersection of MNbasic ideals, and by Theorem 10.12 every MN-basic ideal is continuously closed. \u0003\nExample 10.17. Note that it is not true that continuous closure agrees with mixed\nnatural closure in reduced affine algebras over C. In R = C[x2 , x3 , xy, y], a subring\nof the polynomial ring S = C[x, y], we have that the principal ideal I = yR is such\nmix\nmix\nthat I = I \u266e . (We know that I \u266e is monomial and is contained in (y, xy)R, since\nthis is the contraction of yC[x, y]. Hence, it will suffice to show that xy is not in\n\n\f44\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\nf (I : f )\u266e for any choice of f . Since xy is irreducible in R, the only possibilities for\nf are, up to multiplication by nonzero elements of C, 1 and xy. The choice f = 1\ndoes not work since I \u266e = I, and the choice f = xy does not work since I :R f\nis proper monomial, and so its natural closure is contained in the homogeneous\nmaximal ideal m of R, while xy \u2208\n/ gym.) However, xy \u2208 I cont .\n11. A bigger axes closure\nIn deciding on a generalization of Brenner's notion of axes closure to arbitrary\nNoetherian rings, we had a choice between whether we would base it on seminormal\nrings or so-called weakly normal rings.\nDefinition 11.1. [AB69] Let R be a reduced Noetherian ring, and R\u2032 the integral\nclosure of R in its fraction field. Then the weak normalization Rwn of R is the set\nof all elements x \u2208 R\u2032 that satisfy the following property for all p \u2208 Spec R:\nIf R/p has prime characteristic p > 0, let \u03c0(p) := p; otherwise let \u03c0(p) := 1.\nn\nThen there is some positive integer n such that (x/1)\u03c0(p) \u2208 Rp + Jac(Rp\u2032 ).\nwn\nWe say that R is weakly normal if R = R .\nIt is clear that if R is weakly normal, it is also seminormal. Moreover, if R\nhas equal characteristic 0, the weak normalization is of course the same as the\nseminormalization of R, and in particular in the finitely generated C-algebra case,\nthey agree. Therefore, with the following definition, one has that I ax = I AX for\nany ideal I in a C-algebra.\nDefinition 11.2. Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R, and f \u2208 R. We\nwrite f \u2208 I AX if for every map from R to an excellent one-dimensional weakly\nnormal ring S, the image of f is in IS.\nIt is quite straightforward to verify that I 7\u2192 I AX is a closure operation.\nProposition 11.3. For every ideal I \u2286 R, a Noetherian ring, I ax \u2286 I AX \u2286 I \u2212 .\nProof. This is clear, since normal =\u21d2 seminormal =\u21d2 weakly normal.\n\n\u0003\n\nOne has the following parallel to Proposition 3.1. Items (6) and (7) follow in\nthis case for the same reasons their analogues did in the seminormal case:\nProposition 11.4. Suppose R, S are reduced Noetherian rings. Let R\u2032 be the\nintegral closure of R in its total quotient ring.\n(1) Suppose R is seminormal. Then R is weakly normal if and only if for any\nprime integer p and any x \u2208 R\u2032 such that xp , px \u2208 R, we have x \u2208 R.\n[Ito83, Proposition 1]\n(2) If g : R \u2192 S is faithfully flat and S is weakly normal, then R is weakly\nnormal. [Man80, Corollary II.2]\n(3) If R is weakly normal and W is a multiplicative set, then W \u22121 R is weakly\nnormal. [Man80, Corollary IV.2]\n(4) Suppose the integral closure of R in its total quotient ring is module-finite\nover R. The following are equivalent: [Man80, Corollary IV.4]\n(a) R is weakly normal.\n(b) Rm is weakly normal for all m \u2208 Max Spec R.\n(c) Rp is weakly normal for all p \u2208 Spec R.\n(d) Rp is weakly normal for all p \u2208 Spec R such that depth Rp = 1.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n45\n\n(5) Suppose g : R \u2192 S is flat with geometrically reduced (e.g. normal) fibers\nand R\u2032 is module-finite over R. If R is weakly normal, then so is S. [Man80,\nProposition III.3] In particular, if S is smooth over R, which includes the\ncase where S is \u00e9tale over R, and R is weakly normal, then S is weakly\nnormal.\n(6) A directed union of weakly normal rings is weakly normal.\n(7) If R is local and weakly normal, then the Henselization of R and the strict\nHenselization of R are weakly normal.\n(8) Suppose R is excellent and local. R is weakly normal \u21d0\u21d2 R\u0302 is weakly\nnormal. [Man80, Proposition III.5]\n(9) Let X be an indeterminate over R. R is weakly normal \u21d0\u21d2 R[[X]] is\nweakly normal. [Man80, Proposition III.7]\nFor reasons parallel to observations in the ax case, it suffices to consider only\nmaps to where S is local, or even complete local. Many properties which hold for\nI ax have analogies in I AX . To see how this works, we offer the following analogue\nto Theorem 3.3.\nTheorem 11.5. Let k be a field of prime characteristic p > 0, let L1 , . . . , Ln\nbe finite algebraic extension fields of k such that under the diagonal embedding\nk \u2192 L1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ln , the image of k is pth-root closed. LetQ(Vi , mi ) be discrete\nn\nvaluation rings such that Vi /mi \u223c\n= Li . Let S be the subring of i=1 Vi consisting of\nall n-tuples (v1 , . . . , vn ) such that there exists \u03b1 \u2208 k such that vi \u2261 \u03b1 (mod mi ) for\nall i. Then S is weakly normal.\nConversely, let (R, m, k) be a complete one-dimensional weakly normal Noetherian local ring, where k has prime characteristic p > 0. Then there exist such\nextension fields Li and such DVRs Vi (which moreover are complete) such that R\nis isomorphic to the ring S described above.\nProof. If R is weakly normal, then it is seminormal, so it has the form given in\nTheorem 3.3. One must only check that k is p th-root closed in L1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ln . So\nlet p be the characteristic of k, which must therefore agree with Q\nthe characteristics\nn\nof all the Li . We may assumeQp > 0. Let c = (c1 , . . . , cn ) \u2208 i=1 Li such that\ncp \u2208 k. Let v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 Vi such that ci is the residue class of vi mod mi ,\nfor each i. Then pv = pv = 0 \u2208 k, so that pv \u2208 R, and v p = cp \u2208 k, so that v p \u2208 R.\nSince R is weakly normal, it follows that v \u2208 R.\nConversely, suppose R is constructed in the way outlined in the statement of the\ntheorem. Say p is the characteristic\nQn of k. Without loss of generality, p > 0. Let q\nbe a prime integer and let v \u2208 i=1 Vi be such that v q , qv \u2208QR. If q 6= p, then since\nq is a unit in all of the Li , it follows that it is invertible in Li . So qv \u2208 k implies\nthat v \u2208 k, which then implies\nQ that v \u2208 R by the description of R. On the other\nhand, if v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 Vi isQsuch that v p , pv \u2208 R, then, in particular, v p \u2208 k,\nand since k is p th-root closed in Li , it follows that v \u2208 k, so that v \u2208 R.\n\u0003\nIt follows, for example, that a local or complete ring of axes over any field is\nweakly normal, since the diagonal embedding in question is the usual one, k \u2192\nk \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 k, in which it is clear that the image of k is pth-root closed.\nWe also have the following parallel to Proposition 3.4\nProposition 11.6. Let L be an algebraically closed field.\n(a) A complete axes ring over L is weakly normal.\n\n\f46\n\nNEIL EPSTEIN AND MELVIN HOCHSTER\n\n(b) Every complete local one-dimensional weakly normal ring of equal characteristic with algebraically closed residue class field L is isomorphic with a\ncomplete ring of axes over L.\n(c) Every affine ring of axes over L is weakly normal.\n(d) A one-dimensional affine L-algebra R is weakly normal if and only if there\nare finitely many \u00e9tale L-algebra maps \u03b8i : R \u2192 Ai , where the Ai are affine\nrings of axes over L, and every maximal ideal of R lies under a maximal\nideal of some Ai .\nCombining this with Proposition 3.4, it follows that for complete one-dimensional\nrings with algebraically closed residue field, and for finitely generated one-dimensional\nalgebras over an algebraically closed field, there is no difference between weak normality and seminormality.\nProof. For part (a), we use the characterization in Theorem 11.5, noting that one\nobtains no extra pth roots from the diagonal embedding L \u2192 L \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 L. For part\n(b), any complete local one-dimensional weakly normal ring of equal characteristic\nwith residue field L is in particular seminormal, so by Proposition 3.4(b), it is\nisomorphic to a complete ring of axes over L. Part (c) then follows immediately\nfrom part (a) and from parts 4b and 8 of Proposition 11.4.\nThe proof of part (d) follows from the argument in the proof of Proposition 3.4(d),\nusing the corresponding parts of Proposition 11.4 in place of where we had previously used Proposition 3.1.\n\u0003\nHowever,\n\nAX\n\nis really too big for our purposes here. Consider the following:\n\nExample 11.7. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, let t, x be analytic indeterminates, and let R = k(tp )[[x, tx]]. Then we claim that R is seminormal, but\nalso that R\u2032 = Rwn = k(t)[[x]]. The statement about the weak normalization follows from the fact that tp , pt = 0 \u2208 R. The resulting ring is obviously normal,\nso R\u2032 = Rwn = k(t)[[x]]. To see that R is seminormal, take any f \u2208 R\u2032 such\nthat f 2 , f 3 \u2208 R. Then if f0 is the constant term of the power series f , we have\nf02 , f03 \u2208 k(tp ), whence f0 = f03 /f02 \u2208 k(tp ). But R is exactly the set of all f \u2208 R\u2032\nwhose constant term is in k(tp ).\nNow let m = (x, tx)R be the unique maximal ideal of R, and let I = xR. Note\nthat I is m-primary. Then I AX = xRwn \u2229 R = (x, tx)R = m, but I \u266e = I ax = I\nbecause R is a one-dimensional complete seminormal ring. Hence,\nand AX do not always agree, even for m-primary ideals in 1-dimensional\ncomplete local domains, and\n(2) \u266e and AX do not always agree, even for m-primary ideals in 1-dimensional\ncomplete local domains.\n\n(1)\n\nax\n\nProperty (1) is perhaps not surprising, but property (2) means that the closure\nis too big to apply our methods mutatis mutandis: since one lacks the property\nthat I AX = I \u266e for primary ideals, it is not clear how one would prove an analogue\nof Theorem 7.12 or of the crucial Theorem 7.17 in this new context (substituting\nAX\nfor ax and weakly normal for seminormal everywhere). Thus, this bigger axes\nclosure does not appear to be as suitable for our main purpose here as the smaller\none. However, we have provided some of the fundamentals in this section because\nit may be useful in other situations.\n\n\fCONTINUOUS CLOSURE, AXES CLOSURE, AND NATURAL CLOSURE\n\n47\n\nReferences\n[AB69]\n[AHH93]\n\n[Art69]\n[Bom73]\n\n[Bre06]\n[Eak68]\n[EH79]\n[Eps10]\n[Eps12]\n\n[FK13]\n\n[Gib89]\n[GT80]\n[GV11]\n[GW77]\n[HH94a]\n[HH94b]\n[HR74]\n[HS06]\n[Ito83]\n[Kol12]\n[LV81]\n[Man80]\n[Mat86]\n\n[Nag62]\n[Nag68]\n[Swa80]\n\nAldo Andreotti and Enrico Bombieri, Sugli omeomorfismi delle variet\u00e0 algebriche, Ann.\nScuola Norm.
