However, there exist vexed problems regarding the connection between classical and quantum\nmechanics; the question whether quantum mechanics in the macroscopic limit is completely equivalent to classical\nmechanics remains the focal point of diverging view points. This is poignantly reflected in the various controversies\npersisting in the relevant literature [1]-[4]. Several naive interpretations of the classical limit of quantum mechanics\nbased on approaches such as the ~ \u2192 0 limit, the large quantum number (N \u2192 \u221e) limit, or the Ehrenfest theorem,\nare all riddled with well known difficulties [1]-[3]. Einstein [2] and Pauli [3] strongly advocated the tenet that in the\nmacroscopic limit, not only the localised wave functions but all physically admissible solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation must lead to predictions equivalent to those obtainable from classical mechanics. Such comparison between\nthe two mechanics can be meaningful only within the framework of the ensemble interpretation. Thus the classical\nlimit problem boils down to probing whether there is complete equivalence in the macroscopic limit between the\nempirical predictions of classical and quantum mechanics with respect to the properties of the same initial ensemble.\nThis is the spirit which motivates the present investigation.\nFor complete equivalence between classical mechanics and the macroscopic limit of quantum mechanics the following criterion is necessary. In the classical limit all the measurable properties of a quantum mechanical ensemble\ncorresponding to any normalizable wave function \u03a8(x, t) should be equally reproduced by the classical phase space\nformalism using a distribution function D(x, p, t) utterly determined by the classical phase space description where\nthe time-development of D(x, p, t) is in accordance with the classical Liouville's equation, and where the initial phase\nspace distribution function for the ensemble of particles is taken matching with the initial quantum position and\nmomentum distribution. In the current investigation we formulate the classical phase space distribution in a way\nwhich is completely classical unlike the one that is called the quantum phase space distribution function such as the\nWigner distribution function [5]. The latter is essentially a quantum entity obtained by directly using the expression\nof the wave function, and is constructed to reproduce the results of quantum mechanics, but it does not satisfy the\nclassical Liouville's equation. So, the Wigner distribution function, not being a positive definite quantity in general,\ndoes not provide the results of a classical phase space evolution. In contrast we formulate a phase space distribution\nfunction D(x, p, t) that is positive definite and also satisfies the classical Liouville's equation. The motivation for this\nwork is to study the comparison between quantum mechanical results and those obtained from a purely classical phase\nspace description by formulating a proper classical counterpart of the quantum ensemble. Here our focus is on the\narrival time of the free particles but one can also investigate the quantum-classical comparison for other dynamical\nvariables for particles in various types of potentials using the same approach.\nIn recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in understanding the concept of time of arrival for a quantum\nparticle [6]. In general, the issue of providing physically meaningful definitions of experimentally measured times in\nvaried arenas such as tunneling times, decay times, dwell times, delay times, arrival times has gained importance [7].\n\n\f3\nIn this paper we are specifically concerned with the issue of arrival time. In classical mechanics, a particle follows\na definite trajectory; hence the time at which a particle reaches a given location is a well defined concept. On the\nother hand, in standard quantum mechanics, the meaning of arrival time has remained rather obscure. Indeed, there\nexists an extensive literature on the treatment of arrival time distribution in quantum mechanics [8]. A consistent\napproach of formulating a definition for arrival time distribution is through the quantum probability current [9]. The\nquantum probability current if defined in an unambiguous manner contains the spin of a particle, as was pointed\nout by Holland [10]. Recently it has been shown using the explicit example of a Gaussian wave packet that the\nspin-dependence of the probability current leads to the spin-dependence of the mean arrival time for free particles\n[11]. This effect, if experimentally observed, should place the probability current approach to mean arrival time on\na firmer footing. A key issue for any definition of time of arrival in quantum mechanics is to secure an acceptable\nclassical limit of the arrival time formulation. We formulate a classical analogue of the arrival time distribution for\nfree particles obtained via the quantum probability current. Aspects of the quantum-to-classical transition for the\narrival time distribution are then investigated.\n\n2.ARRIVAL TIME DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe begin our analysis with the standard description of the flow of probability in quantum mechanics, which is\ngoverned by the continuity equation derived from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation given by\n\n\u2202\n|\u03a8(x, t)|2 + \u2207.J(x, t) = 0\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\ni~\n(\u03a8\u2207\u03a8\u2217 \u2212 \u03a8\u2217 \u2207\u03a8) defined as the probability current density corresponds to this flow of\nThe quantity J(x, t)= 2m\n\nprobability. We use this current to define the arrival time distribution for free particles. Interpreting the equation of\ncontinuity in terms of the flow of physical probability, the Born interpretation for the squared modulus of the wave\nfunction and its time derivative suggest that the mean arrival time of the particles reaching a detector located at\nx = X may be written as\nR\u221e\n|J(x = X, t)|tdt\n\u03c4\u0304 = R0\u221e\n0 |J(x = X, t)|dt\n\n(2)\n\nHenceforth, for simplicity we shall restrict ourselves to only one spatial dimension. One should keep in mind that\nthe definition of the mean arrival time used in Eq(s).(2) is not a uniquely derivable result within standard quantum\nmechanics. However, the Bohmian interpretation [12] of quantum mechanics in terms of the causal trajectories of\nindividual particles implies the above expression for the mean arrival time in a unique and rigorous way [13]. It\nshould also be noted that in ceratin situations J(X, t) can be negative over some time interval provided the initial flux\nJ(X, t = 0) is negative [14]. In order to account for the back flow effect in such cases, the decomposition of J(X, t)\ninto right and left moving parts could be undertaken. However, our present analysis is carried out using a simple\nexample that is free from such complications.\nThe standard Schr\u00f6dinger probability current defined through the continuity equation in non-relativistic quantum\n\n\f4\nmechanics, however, suffers from an inherent ambiguity since the continuity equation remains satisfied with the\naddition of any divergence free term to the current. This feature was exploited to formulate alternative causal\nmodels [15]. Finkelstein has analysed the consequent ambiguities of arrival time distributions [16]. However, it\nwas shown earlier by Gurtler and Hestenes that the problem of non-unique probability current doesn't exist for\nthe relativistic Pauli theory for the electron if the probability current is inclusive of a spin-dependent term [17].\nHolland [10] demonstrated the uniqueness of the conserved probability current in the non-relativistic limit of the\nDirac equation. This probability current differs from the standard Schr\u00f6dinger probability current by the presence\nof a spin-dependent term which persists even in the non-relativistic limit. It has been further argued that the arrival\ntime for a free particle computed using the unique probability current should exhibit an observable spin dependence\n[11]. However, for the case of massive spin-0 particles it has been shown recently by taking the non-relativistic limit\nof Kemmer equation [18] that the unique probability current is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger current, and hence, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger current gives the unique probability current density or the unique arrival time distribution for spin-0\nparticles [19]. In the present analysis we restrict our attention to massive spin-0 particles only.\n\n3.CLASSICAL-QUANTUM CORRESPONDENCE\n\nLet us now consider a Gaussian wave packet representing a quantum free particle moving in 1-D whose initial wave\nfunction \u03a8(x, 0) and its Fourier transform \u03a6(p, 0) are respectively given by\n\n\u03a8(x, 0) =\n\n1\n\n\u221a\ne\n(2\u03c0\u03c30 2 )1/4 1 + iC\n\n\u03a6(p, 0) =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c30 2\n\u03c0~2\n\n\u00131/4\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n\uf6be\n\nn\nikx\u2212 4\u03c3\n\n\u03c30 2 (p\u2212p\u0304)2\n~2\n\nx2\n2\n0 (1+iC)\n\n(1+iC)\n\no\n\n(3)\n\nff\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the group velocity of the wave packet u = ~k/m = p\u0304/m. For generality we have taken the initial Gaussian\n\u221a\nwave function \u03a8(x, 0) which is not a minimum uncertainty state (\u2206x\u2206p = (~/2) 1 + C 2 > ~/2), but which could\nrepresent a squeezed state [20]. The Schr\u00f6dinger time evolved wave function \u03a8(x, t), the quantum position probability\ndensity \u03c1Q (x, t) and the probability current density JQ (x, t) at a particular location x are then respectively given by\n\n1\n\n\u03a8(x, t) =\n(2\u03c0\u03c30\n\n2 )1/4\n\nq\n1 + i(C +\n\n\u03c1Q (x, t) = |\u03a8(x, t)|2 =\n\n~t\n2m\u03c30 2 )\n\ne\n\nik (x \u2212 12\n\nut)\n\nexp\n\n1\n(2\u03c0\u03c30 2 )1/2\n\nq\n1 + (C +\n\n~t\n2\n2m\u03c30 2 )\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n(x \u2212 ut)2\n\nh\n\u2212\n\uf8f3 4\u03c3 2 1 + i(C +\n0\n\nexp\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n(x \u2212 ut)2\n\nh\n\u2212\n\uf8f3 2\u03c3 2 1 + (C +\n0\n\n\uf8fc\n~t\n\uf8fd\n~(C + 2m\u03c3\n2 )(x \u2212 ut)\n0\nh\ni\nJQ (x, t) = \u03c1Q (x, t) u +\n~t\n\uf8f3\n2 \uf8fe\n2m\u03c30 2 1 + (C + 2m\u03c3\n2)\n0\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\ni\n\n~t\n2m\u03c30 2 )\n\n~t\n2\n2m\u03c30 2 )\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n(5)\n\n\uf8fe\ni\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n(6)\n\n\uf8fe\n(7)\n\n\f5\nIn order to elucidate the classical counterpart of the quantum probability current, we now construct a classical\nformulation of arrival time for an ensemble of free particles. We take the initial phase space distribution function\nfor the ensemble of particles as a product of two Gaussian functions matching with the initial quantum position and\nmomentum distributions from Eq(s).(3) and (4) as\n\nD0 (x0 , p0 , 0) = |\u03a8(x0 , 0)|2 |\u03a6(p0 , 0)|2 =\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\nx20\n2\u03c30 2 (p0 \u2212 p\u0304)2\n1\nexp \u2212\n\u2212\n2\u03c30 2 (1 + C 2 )\n~2\n\u03c0~ 1 + C 2\n\u221a\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the variables x0 and p0 are the initial positions and momenta of the particles. Note that our approach to\ncompare the quantum and classical predictions is not contingent to any particular initial form of the wave function.\nThe key point of this scheme is to choose the initial classical ensemble in such a way that it reproduces the initial\nquantum position and momentum distributions. Classically of course there are other choices for D0 (x0 , p0 , 0). But\nin quantum mechanics, due to the uncertainty principle, given a wave function \u03c8(x, t), the momentum space wave\nfunction \u03c6(p, t) is automatically fixed by the Fourier transform of \u03c8(x, t). In this way the position probability density\n|\u03c8|2 and the momentum probability density |\u03c6|2 are correlated in quantum mechanics. There is no such restriction for\nthe position and momentum densities in classical statistical mechanics. But it is quite reasonable to take the initial\nclassical phase space distribution exactly matching with the initial quantum position and momentum probability\ndensities in order to compare the results obtained from the dynamical evolutions of classical and quantum mechanics.\nThis is precisely the motivation to take the initial phase space distribution D0 (x0 , p0 , 0) in a way given by Eq(s).(8).\nNow to obtain the time evolved density function D(x, p, t) we focus on the classical dynamics of freely moving\nparticles. The Hamiltonian is H = p2 /2m and the Hamilton's equations are x = pt/m + x0 and p = p0 where the\nvariables x0 and p0 are the initial position and momentum of the particle which are respectively given by x0 = x\u2212pt/m\nand p0 = p. Substituting these values of x0 and p0 in the expression of D0 (x0 , p0 , 0) we obtain the time evolved\ndistribution function D(x, p, t). This is because here we are considering the free evolution of an ensemble of particles\nwhose initial positions (x0 ) and momenta (p0 ) are distributed according to the initial density function D0 (x0 , p0 , 0).\nThe time evolved phase space distribution is then given by\n\n(\n)\npt 2\n(x \u2212 m\n)\n2\u03c30 2 (p \u2212 p\u0304)2\n1\n\u221a\nexp \u2212\n\u2212\nD(x, p, t) =\n2\u03c30 2 (1 + C 2 )\n~2\n\u03c0~ 1 + C 2\n\n(9)\n\nAt this stage it is instructive to write down the the Wigner distribution function which is calculated [20] from the\ntime evolved wave function (\u03a8(x, t)), and is given by\n\nDW (x, p, t) =\n\n1\n\u03c0~\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (x + y, t)\u03a8(x \u2212 y, t) exp{2ipy/~}dy\n\n(10)\n\nBy substituting the value of \u03a8(x + y, t) and \u03a8(x \u2212 y, t) using Eq(s).(5) we obtain\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n[x \u2212 pt/m \u2212 2C(p \u2212 p\u0304)\u03c30 2 /~]2\n2(p \u2212 p\u0304)2 \u03c30 2\n1\nexp \u2212\nexp \u2212\nDW (x, p, t) =\n\u03c0~\n~2\n2\u03c30 2\n\n(11)\n\n\f6\n4000\n\n1500\n\n900\n\n600\n\nMass=1 a.m.u.\n-----> \u03c1Q\n\n300\n\n1.

Thus, if we take the initial phase space distribution function for the classical ensemble of particles as a\nproduct of two Gaussian functions matching with the initial quantum position and momentum distributions then the\nclassical arrival time distribution exactly matches with the quantum one provided the minimum uncertainty relation is\nsatisfied. But in general the quantum and classical distribution functions are different when the minimum uncertainty\ncondition is not satisfied (C 6= 0).\nThough JQ (X, t) and JC (X, t) are in general not equal for C 6= 0, the large mass limits of both are the same.\nThis is seen from Figures 1 and 2 where the probability distributions and the currents are plotted respectively for\ndifferent masses. It is apparent that in the large mass limit quantum distributions reduce to the classical distributions.\nThe mass dependendence in the arrival time distributions and also in the position probability densities (for both the\nquantum and classical case) arises from the spreading of the wave packet.\nWe now compute the mean arrival time \u03c4\u0304 by substituting the expressions for the quantum current in Eq(s).(2). [One\nshould note that though the integral in the numerator of Eq(s).(2) formally diverges logarithmically, several techniques\n\n\f8\n0.62\n\n0.58\n\n-\n\nMean arrival time ( \u03c4 ) in sec.\n\n0.6\n\n0.56\n\n0.54\nX=5.3 cm\nX=5.2 cm\n\n0.52\n\nX=5.1 cm\n0.5\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nMass (m) in a.m.u.\n\nFIG. 3: The mean arrival time \u03c4\u0304 is plotted against the mass of the particles (in atomic mass unit) at different detector locations\nX = 5.1 cm, X = 5.2 cm, and X = 5.3 cm. for C=10, \u03c30 = 0.0001 cm, u = 10 cm/sec.\n\nhave been employed in the literature [22] ensuring rapid fall off for the probability distributions asymptotically, so\nthat convergent results are obtained for the integrated arrival time. Here we have employed a simple strategy of\ntaking a cut-off (t = T ) in the upper limit of the time integral with T = (X + 3\u03c3T )/u where \u03c3T is the width of the\nwave packet at time T . In other words, our computations of the arrival time are valid up to the 3\u03c3 level of spread\nin the wave function.] It is instructive to examine the variation of mean arrival time with the different parameters\nof the wave packet. In Figure 3 we have plotted the variation of \u03c4\u0304 with mass at different detector locations, keeping\nthe group velocity u and initial width \u03c30 fixed. One sees that the mean arrival time calulated by using the quantum\ncurCnt JQ (X, t) as the arrival time distribution asymptotically approaches the classical result in the limit of large\nmass.\n4.SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nTo summarize, in this paper we have investigated the quantum-to-classical transition of the mean arrival time\ndefined through the probability current. We have formulated the classical arrival time distribution from the phase\nspace distribution for a classical ensemble of particles. The expression for classical probability current constructed\nby us matches exactly with the quantum probability current in the limit of minimum uncertainty. We note that the\nuncertainty condition is not a stringent requirement for the case of the initial classical distribution. Thus the classical\narrival time distribution JC (X, t) will in general be different from the quantum distribution JQ (X, t) if we do not\nimpose the minimum uncertainty restriction on the initial distribution. This issue needs to be explored further in\norder to have a deeper understanding of the quantum-classical comparison of arrival time. However, in the present\nexample that we have constructed, the quantum results for the probability current and through it the arrival time\ndistribution, approaches the classical result in the large mass limit. A number of schemes [8, 13, 16, 23] have been\nsuggested in the literature for calculating the arrival time distribution such as those based on axiomatic approaches,\ntrajectory models of quantum mechanics, attempts to define and calculate the arrival time distribution using the\n\n\f9\nconsistent histories approach, and attempts of constructing the time of arrival operator, etc. It might be worthwhile\nto investigate the quantum-classical correspondence of the arrival time distribution using these different approaches.\nSuch studies, if undertaken extensively, are not only expected to throw light on the comparitive merits of different\narrival time formulations, but could also be of relevance to the behaviour of mesoscopic systems where a great deal\nof experimental activity is presently underway [24].\nClassically we know that a point particle with uniform motion will reach a particular location at a time which\nis independent of the mass of the particle and depends only on its uniform velocity. In the discussion of classical\nlimit of quantum mechanics it is usually assumed that the peak mean position of the wave packet moves according\nto classical trajectory derived from the Ehrenfest theorem. It could be argued though that one should not expect to\nrecover an individual classical trajectory when one takes the classical limit of quantum mechanics. Rather, one should\nexpect the probability distributions of quantum mechanics to become equivalent to the probability distributions of an\nensemble of classical trajectories. The current investigation is concerned about this particular approach to test the\nquantitative equivalence between the classical mechanical prediction and the prediction obtained in the macroscopic\nlimit of quantum mechanics. Here, what we see is that the mean time of arrival of a freely moving quantum particle\ncomputed through the probability current depends on the mass of the particle even if its group velocity is fixed. So it\nturns out that the characteristic of mean time in this framework is different from that of mean position. The predicted\nmass dependence of mean arrival time is, in principle, amenable for experimental verification, and is a clear signature\nof the probability current approach to time in quantum mechanics [9].\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Late S.
