This link allows us to\nestablish some polynomial time complexity results about solving this optimization problem\nand its inverse counter-part.\n\n1\n\nA class of IP games\ni\n\ni\n\nThere are N players. For i = 1, . . . , N , let Ai \u2208 Zd \u00d7n , bi \u2208 Zd , and ui \u2208 Zn+ . Each player i selects\na solution xi to the linear Diophantine system Ai x = bi , 0 \u2264 x \u2264 ui , x \u2208 Zn , which is referred\nto as a pure strategy of player i. The costs to i for playing his strategy depend on the strategies\nchosen by the other players. A player is called satisfied if his selected strategy is cost-minimal\ngiven the strategies of all other players. A pure Nash-equilibrium is an assignment of strategies to\nplayers such that all players are satisfied simultaneously. Note that in the described situation each\nplayer can choose his strategy independently of the strategies of the other players. In contrast to\nthis,\nimpose a coupling constraint on the possible strategies for all players together, say\nPN onei could\n0\ni\nB\nx\n\u2264\nb\nfor matrices B i \u2208 Zm\u00d7n , i = 1, . . . , N , and for some b0 \u2208 Zm . Again, a player\ni=1\nis called satisfied if his selected strategy is cost-minimal given the strategies of all other players.\nClearly, his strategy has to obey the coupling constraint resulting from fixing the strategies of the\nother players. A generalized Nash-equilibrium is an assignment of strategies to players such that\nall players are satisfied simultaneously in this more general situation. Clearly, we can model the\nunrestricted situtation by simply putting all B i to zero matrices.\nLet us be more specific now. Let there be given functions cj : R+ \u2192 R+ that evaluate the cost of\nPN\nelement j = 1, . . . , n. In our setting, we have costs cj (y) if all the players together use y = i=1 xij\n1\n\n\funits of element j. In formulae, the costs assigned to player k are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n!\nN\nN\nn\nN\nn\nn\nN\nn\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\ncj \uf8ed\nyji \uf8f8 .\nyji \uf8f8 \u2212\ncj \uf8edyjk +\ncj \uf8ed\nyji \uf8f8 =\nyji \u2212\ncj\nj=1\n\ni=1,i6=k\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1,i6=k\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\ni=1,i6=k\n\nFrom now on, we assume that cj is a monotonously increasing function for all j = 1, . . . , n. The\nfollowing result is an extension of a theorem by Rosenthal [6].\nTheorem 1 All games of the above class with at least one choice (x1 , . . . , xN ) of strategies that\nP\n0\ni i\nfulfill the coupling constraint N\ni=1 B x \u2264 b possess at least one generalized Nash-equilibrium.\nProof. Consider the problem\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n!\nN\nN\nn\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2X\nX\nX\nB i xi \u2264 b0 , xi \u2208 Zn+ .\nxij : Ai xi = bi , 0 \u2264 xi \u2264 ui ,\ncj\nmin\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nj=1\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nBy assumption, this problem has at least one solution. Moreover, as for j = 1, . . . , n, the functions\ncj are monotonously increasing, they are all bounded from below, and thus, Problem (1) has\nan optimal solution. We claim that any optimal solution to Problem (1) is a generalized Nashequilibrium.\nLet (y1 , . . . , yN ) be an optimal solution to Problem (1). For the purpose of deriving a contradiction,\nsuppose that (y1 , . . . , yN ) is not a generalized Nash-equilibrium. Then there exists some player i,\nw.l.o.g. i = 1, and a strategy z1 such that z1 has lower costs\n!\n!\nN\nn\nN\nn\nX\nX\nX\nX\ni\ni\n1\nyj\ncj\nyj \u2212\ncj z j +\nthan the costs\n\nj=1\n\ni=2\n\nn\nX\n\nN\nX\n\ncj\n\nyj1 +\n\nyji\n\ni=2\n\nj=1\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\nj=1\n\ni=2\n\nn\nX\n\nN\nX\n\ncj\n\nyji\n\ni=2\n\nj=1\n\n!\n\nof strategy y1 given fixed strategies y2 , . . . , yN .

Notice that the objective function in Problem(1) can be\ninterpreted as the costs of a provider to account for realizing all the strategies. The costs assigned\n2\n\n\fto a player, however, are marginal costs. If all cj , j = 1, . . . , n, are nonlinear convex functions,\nthe sum of costs for all players exceeds the costs for the provider, i.e., it generates a gain for the\nprovider. The more players play the bigger this gain gets. This fact motivates the provider to have\nall his players being satisfied. Interestingly, each player is satisfied when they cooperate to minimize\nthe costs of the provider.\n\n2\n\nComplexity results for convex cost functions\n\nLet us assume in this section that all matrices Ai are equal to A, that all matrices B i are equal\nto B, and that the cj : R+ \u2192 R+ , j = 1, . . . , n, are univariate convex functions. This latter\ncondition is quite natural, since it simply means that the difference functions cj (y + 1) \u2212 cj (y)\nare monotonously increasing, that is, the cost for one extra unit of component j is monotonously\nincreasing the more of component j is used.\nWith the simplifications, Problem (1) has a nice combinatorial structure:\n8\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n<X\nn\n\n0 I\nn\nB B\nB A\nB\nB 0\nmin\ncj (yj ) : B\nB\n>\n>\nB\n>\n.\nj=1\n>\nB\n>\n.\n>\n@\n>\n>\n.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n0\n:\n\nIn\nB\n0\nA\n.\n.\n.\n0\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\nIn\nB\n0\n0\n\n\u2212In\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\nIn\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\nA\n\n.\n.\n.\n0\n\n.\n.\n.\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n***\n\n0\nx1\nB x2\nB\nCB\nC B x3\nCB\nCB\n.\nCB\nCB\n.\nCB\n.\nCB\nA B xN\nB\n@\ny\ns\n\n1\n\n0\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nC= B\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nC\n@\nA\n\n1\n\n0\nb0\nb1\nb2\n.\n.\n.\nbN\n\n1\n\n0\nC\nx1\nC\nC B x2\nC B\nC B\nC,B\n.\nC B\n.\nC B\nC @\n.\nC\nN\nA\nx\n\n1\n\n0\n\nB\nC\nB\nC\nB\nC\nC \u2264 B\nB\nC\nB\nC\n@\nA\n\nu1\nu2\n.\n.\n.\nN\nu\n\n1\n\n9\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n=\n\nC\nC\nC\nC , x1 , . . . , xN , y \u2208 Zn\nC\n+> .\n>\nC\n>\n>\nA\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n;\n\n(2)\n\nThis structure allows us to prove a complexity result about the computation of the generalized\nNash-equilibrium. However, in order to prove this, we need to introduce the notion of the Graver\nbasis of a matrix together with a few important facts about these bases and about N -fold integer\nprograms.\nFor D \u2208 Zd\u00d7n let G(D) denote the Graver basis of D. This Graver basis consists exactly of those\nnonzero elements z in ker(A) \u2229 Zn = {x : Ax = 0} \u2229 Zn that cannot be written as a non-trivial\nsum z = u + v where u, v \u2208 ker(A) \u2229 Zn and where u and v have the same sign-pattern, that is,\nuj vj \u2265 0 for all j = 1, . . . , n. For any matrix D, the Graver basis G(D) is a finite set [2], and it\nhas the nice property that it provides\nnPan optimality certificate for the family of\no separable convex\nn\nn\ninteger minimization problems min\nfor any choice of\nj=1 fj (xj ) : Dx = d, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 u, x \u2208 Z+\nconvex functions fj : R \u2192 R, j = 1, . . . , n, and for any choice of d \u2208 Zd [2, 5]. That is, for any\nchoice of the input data and for any feasible solution x0P\nof the problem, x0 P\nis optimal if and only\nn\nn\n0\nif there is no g \u2208 G(D) such that x + g is feasible and i=j fj (x0j + gj ) < i=j fj (x0j ).\n\nHaving a finite optimality certificate available, one can augment any given feasible solution of the\nproblem to an optimal solution by iteratively walking along directions provided by the optimality\ncertificate. If a simple greedy augmentation is followed, only a polynomial number (in the encoding\nlength of the input data) of Graver basis augmentation steps is needed to construct an initial feasible\nsolution and to augment it to optimality [1, 3]. Thus, if we had a Graver basis G(D) that is of\npolynomial\nsize in hDi, this augmentation approach\nprovides a polynomial time algorithm to solve\no\nnP\nn\nn\nmin\nj=1 fj (xj ) : Dx = d, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 u, x \u2208 Z+ .\n3\n\n\fUsing results of [4, 7], it was shown in [1] that for fixed matrices A and B (of appropriate dimensions) the sizes and the encoding lengths of the Graver bases of the family of matrices\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nB B *** B\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec A\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(N )\nA\n[A, B]\n:= \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nA\n\nincrease only polynomially in N . Thus, if we choose D = [A, B](N ) the corresponding separable\nconvex minimization problem, a so-called N -fold integer program, can be solved in polynomial\ntime for fixed matrices A and B [1, 3]. The following lemma shows that for fixed matrices A and\nB also the Graver bases of Problem (2) increase only polynomially in N .

From Lemma 2, we know that the Graver basis of the problem matrix [A, B]\nhas a\npolynomial-size encoding length in the encoding length of the input data. The result now follows\nfrom Theorem 7 in [3], which bounds the number of augmentations so as to reach an optimal\nsolution of Problem (2).\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nInverse optimization problem\n\nA (generalized) Nash-equilibrium satisfies all players simultaneously. It requires that cost functions\ncj , j = 1, . . . , n, are given. Conversely, one may ask for finding cost functions cj , j = 1, . . . , n, that\nturn a given set {x1 , . . . , xN } of strategies into a Nash-equilibrium. Such inverse optimization\nproblems are fundamental for a variety of applications, such as quality control in production\nsystems, portfolio optimization, or production capacity planning, see [9] for details and references.\nThe problem in this generality is hopeless unless some structure on the cost functions cj , j =\n1, . . . , n, can be assumed. We study the situation that each cj has the form cj (y) = \u03bbj fj (y) for\nsome fixed given convex function fj : R+ \u2192 R+ and some \u03bbj \u2208 R+ that can be adjusted.\nWe can abstract from this setting slightly and define a general inverse integer optimization problem\nas follows.\nLemma 4 Consider the problem (IIOP): Given a polyhedron P = {x : Dx = d, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 u} \u2286 Rn ,\nx\u2217 \u2208 P \u2229 Zn and convex functions fj : R \u2192 R.

By Theorem 3 in [3], x\u2217 minimizes f (x) = j=1 \u03bbj fj (xj ) over all x \u2208 P \u2229 Zn if and if\nonly if f (x\u2217 + g) \u2265 f (x\u2217 ) for all g \u2208 G(D) such that x\u2217 + g \u2208 P . Clearly, this can be checked in\npolynomial time in hG(D)i, showing (b).\nTo show (a), observe that this criterion is equivalent to asking for a solution to the following system\n\n5\n\n\fin variables \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn :\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbj fj (x\u2217j + gj ) \u2265\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbj fj (x\u2217j )\n\nfor all g \u2208 G(D) such that x\u2217 + g \u2208 P,\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn\nn\nX\n\u03bbj\n\n\u2265\n>\n\n0,\n\n0,\n\nj=1\n\nor equivalently, letting H = {g \u2208 G(D) such that x\u2217 + g \u2208 P },\nn\nX\n\u0002\nj=1\n\n\u0003\nfj (x\u2217j + gj ) \u2212 fj (x\u2217j ) \u03bbj\n\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn\nn\nX\n\u03bbj\n\n\u2265 0\n\nfor all g \u2208 H,\n\n\u2265 0,\n> 0.\n\nj=1\n\nIf this system has no solution, then there exists a subsystem\nn\nX\n\u0002\nj=1\n\n\u0003\nfj (x\u2217j + gj ) \u2212 fj (x\u2217j ) \u03bbj\n\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn\nn\nX\n\u03bbj\n\n\u2265 0\n\nfor all g \u2208 H \u2032 ,\n\n\u2265 0,\n> 0,\n\nj=1\n\nfor H \u2032 \u2286 H of at most |H \u2032 | \u2264 n + 1 inequalities having no solution. (This is a consequence of\nCaratheodory's theorem and the Farkas-Lemma, see p. 94 in [8].)\nNow we can apply standard linear programming technology: From the Farkas-Lemma, it follows\n|H \u2032 |\nthat the latter system is not solvable if and only if there exists a vector v = (vg )g\u2208H \u2032 \u2208 Q+ such\nthat\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nvg fj (x\u2217j + gj ) \u2212 fj (x\u2217j ) < 0 for all j = 1, . . . , n.\ng\u2208H \u2032\n\nThis is a polynomially sized certificate for the \"No.\"-answer to (IIOP), showing (a).\n\n\u0003\n\nNotice that Lemma 4 (b) implies that if a Graver basis happens to be of polynomial size in the encoding length of the input data hD, ui of the integer program, then the corresponding optimization\nproblem (IIOP) can be solved in polynomial time in hD, ui.\nReturning to Problem (2), we want to solve its inverse counter-part. Note that again we assume\nthat each cj has the form cj (y) = \u03bbj fj (y) for some fixed given convex function fj : R+ \u2192 R+ and\nsome \u03bbj \u2208 R+ that can be adjusted.\nCorollary 5 Let the matrices A and B be fixed and assume that all fj : R+ \u2192 R+ , j = 1, . . . , n,\nare univariate convex functions given by evaluation oracles.

From Lemma 2, we know that the Graver basis of the problem matrix [A, B]\n(2) is of polynomial size in N . The result thus follows from Theorem 4(b).\n\n4\n\nof Problem\n\u0003\n\nExtension of results\n\nLet us call the pair of matrices (Ai , B i ) the type of player i. While in Problem (1) all players could\nhave a different type, we assumed in Problem (2) that all players were of the same type (A, B).\nLet us assume now that there is a constant number of possible player types (Ai , B i ) represented\nby pairs of matrices (\u0100i , B\u0304 i ), i = 1, . . . , t, as in Problem (1). Despite the more general problem,\nthe complexity results of the last two sections still hold.\nTheorem 6 Assume that there is a constant number t of possible player types represented by pairs\n(\u0100i , B\u0304 i ), i = 1, . . . , t, of fixed matrices \u0100i and B\u0304 i , i = 1, . . . , t. For i = 1, . . . , N , select one of\ni\ni\ni\ni\nthese\n\u0010Ppairs (\u0011\u0100 , B\u0304 ), i = 1, . . . , t, as the type (A , B ) of player i. Finally, let M be a bound for\nN\ni\nfor all j and for all feasible selections of strategies for all players.\ncj\ni=1 xj\n\n(a) Problem (1) can be solved in time polynomial in N , in hM, b0 , b1 , . . . , bN , u1 , . . . , uN i, and\nin the number of calls of evaluation oracles.\n(b) Assume that each cj has the form cj (y) = \u03bbj fj (y) for some fixed convex function fj : R+ \u2192\nR+ given by evaluation oracles and some \u03bbj \u2208 R+ that can be adjusted.
