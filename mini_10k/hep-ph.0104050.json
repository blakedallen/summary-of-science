Such tests will hopefully provide first\nclues for physics beyond the Standard Model.\nOur brief review a will focus on recent work, discussing several central examples which represent a much\nbroader study made during the past decade 6 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nAssuming that a phase in the Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa (CKM) matrix is the dominant source of CP\nviolation, sizable CP asymmetries are predicted in a variety of B decay processes. A major task of present\nexperiments at e+ e\u2212 B factories, following an earlier\nmeasurement by the CDF Collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron 1 , is the search for a time-dependent asymmetry in B 0 (t) \u2192 J/\u03c8KS , which can be cleanly interpreted in terms of the weak phase \u03b2 = \u03c61 2,3 . As a\nconsequence of measurements reported at this conference\nby the BaBar 4 and Belle 5 Collaborations, the present\nworld average value of sin 2\u03b2 gained the respectable status of a nonzero measurement at three standard deviation, sin 2\u03b2 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.16, consistent with the CKM\nprediction. The remarkable success in running the two\nasymmetric B factories at SLAC and KEK-B, to be soon\njoined by experiments at the Tevatron, promises a considerable improvement in this important measurement\nduring the coming year.\nIn addition to time-dependent asymmetries, such as\nin B 0 (t) \u2192 J/\u03c8KS or B 0 (t) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which are related to CKM phases, B decays provide an opportunity\nof measuring CP rate asymmetries in a large number of\ntwo body and mutibody B decay modes. In this talk\nwe choose to discuss two classes of decay processes. In\nthe first class, discussed in Section 2, asymmetries can\nprovide crude but very useful tests of the CKM mechanism. While the signs and magnitudes of such direct\nasymmetries depend in general on unknown strong final state phases, these asymmetries will be shown to be\nrelated to each other pairwise in some approximation.\nThe relative signs of pairs of asymmetries in this large\nclass of processes are predicted quite reliably, implying\nthat crude asymmetry measurements can provide simple tests. Measuring \"wrong\" relative signs would most\nlikely imply new physics.\nIn a second class of processes studied in Section 3\n(which in some cases overlaps with the first class) precise asymmetry measurements are shown to provide tight\nconstraints on CKM phases. In several cases such information may be gained by merely measuring certain ratios of charge-averaged decay rates. Combining all these\n\n2\n\nA theorem about equal CP rate differences\n\nA subgroup of flavor SU(3), discrete U-spin symmetry interchanging d and s quarks, plays a particularly powerful\nand important role in charmless B decays 7 .

(7)\n9\n\nThe corresponding strangeness conserving decay amplitudes involve other CKM factors but have the same\nSU(3) structure.\nThe first pair of U-spin processes involve only quark\namplitudes P A + E in which, in the absence of large\nrescattering effects 15 , the spectator quark in the B or\nBs meson participates in the interaction 14 . These decays\ncan be used to test the smallness of rescattering corrections. Unless amplified by rescattering, these amplitudes\nare expected to be suppressed by fB /mB relative to the\ndominant amplitudes occuring in the other two pairs of\nprocesses. Thus, the branching ratio of B 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 is\nexpected to be of the order of 10\u22127 or smaller, compared\nto 10\u22125 characterizing the branching ratios of the other\nfour processes. In order to test the assumption of small\nrescattering effects, the present experimental upper limit\n16\n, B(B 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) < 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 , should be improved\nby at least one order of magnitude.\nAssuming that such a stringent bound is obtained,\none can then neglect corresponding P A + E terms in\nBs \u2192 K + K \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . This implies in the limit\nof U-spin symmetry\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nIm(Vub\nVus Vcb Vcs\n)\n\nUnitarity of the CKM matrix ,\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2212Im(Vub\nVud Vcb Vcd\n), implies the following relation between CP rate differences 7\n(8)\n\u2206(B \u2192 f ) \u2261 \u0393(B \u2192 f ) \u2212 \u0393(B\u0304 \u2192 f ) \u2248\n\u2212\u2206(U B \u2192 U f ) \u2261 \u2212[\u0393(U B \u2192 U f ) \u2212 \u0393(U B\u0304 \u2192 U f )] .\nNamely, CP rate differences (\u2206) in decays which go\ninto one another under interchanging s and d quarks have\nequal magnitudes and opposite signs. This rather powerful result, following from U-spin within the CKM framework, can be demonstrated in numerous decay processes,\nincluding two body, quasi-two body, multibody hadronic\nand radiative B decays. A few examples are\n\u2206\u0393(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2243 \u2212\u2206\u0393(Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212 ) ,\n\n\u2206\u0393(B 0 \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2243 \u2212\u2206\u0393(Bs \u2192 \u03c1+ K \u2212 ) ,\n\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2243 \u2212\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 \u03c0 + K + K \u2212 ) ,\n\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03b3) \u2243 \u2212\u2206\u0393(B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03b3) .\n\n(9)\n\nU-spin is an approximate symmetry of strong interactions. Naively one would think that the approximation\n(8) holds up to small terms of order ms /mb . Considering B decays to two light pseudoscalars, and assuming\n10,11,12\nthat the dominant terms in amplitudes factorize 13 , U-spin breaking corrections in these processes are\ngiven in terms of ratios of decay constants and form factors involving s and d quarks. This may lead to violations\nof asymmetry relations, however such violations are not\nexpected to be gross. Furthermore, independently of any\nassumption, if such asymmetries are large, corresponding to large final state phases in a particular process,\nit is very unlikely that U-spin breaking can change the\nsign of these phases. Consequently, the prediction that\nlarge CP asymmetries in two U-spin related proceesses\nhave opposite signs is expected to be robust even in the\npresence of U-spin breaking effects.\nCan one correct (8) for U-spin breaking effects?\nSince such effects are model-dependent, it would be very\nuseful if they could be directly measured in rates. There\nexists such a possibility 7 if one assumes that certain\nrescattering effects can be neglected. Consider the three\n\nA(Bs \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) \u2243 A(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) ,\nA(Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212 ) \u2243 A(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) .\n\n(11)\n\nThe rates of these four processes can be used to measure\nU-spin corrections. For instance, assuming factorization\nthese corrections are given by ratios of form factors\nFBs K (m2K )\nA(Bs \u2192 K + K \u2212 )\n=\n,\nA(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\nFB\u03c0 (m2K )\nFBs K (m2\u03c0 )\nA(Bs \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\n=\n.\nA(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\nFB\u03c0 (m2\u03c0 )\n\n(12)\n\nThe two ratios of form factors are expected to be equal\nwithin about 1%, since the variation of the two form\nfactors from q 2 = m2\u03c0 to q 2 = m2K is tiny for a relevant\nscale of order m2B . We conclude that (once the smallness\nof rescattering has been established) the rates of these\nfour processes can be used not only to determine the Uspin breaking factor in the ratio of amplitudes, but also to\ncheck the factorization assumption by finding equal ratios\nof amplitudes in the two cases.\n2\n\n\f3\n\nrelative strong phase. This allows a determination of \u03b3\nwith a precision comparable to that achieved when studying B, Bs \u2192 K\u03c0.\n\nStringent constraints on weak phases\n\nIn the present section we discuss recent developments\nin suggestions for determining the weak phase \u03b3. We\nwill also comment briefly on an old idea for resolving\npenguin uncertainties in the determination of sin 2\u03b1 from\nB 0 (t) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\n3.2\n\nA large number of charmless B and Bs decays to two\nlight pseudoscalars can be related to each other under\napproximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. It was noted a long\ntime ago 20 that hadronic weak amplitudes can be classified in SU(3) in terms of quark diagrams. Starting\nwith the papers 14 this framework has been applied to\nthe \u2206B = 1, \u2206C = 0 low energy effective Hamiltonian\n(1) and its \u2206S = 0 counterpart for the purpose of determining weak phases. A large number of proposals of this\nkind 21 were made in the past seven years.\nHere we will focus on a particular recent application. Although SU(3) is only an approximate symmetry\nit will be applied to subleading terms in decay amplitudes\nso that SU(3) breaking corrections will be second order.\nWe will make use of an SU(3) proportionality relation 22\nbetween electroweak penguin operators (Q9.10 ) and the\ncurrent-current operators (Q1,2 ) in (1) transforming as\ngiven SU(3) representations (3, 6 and 15), in which the\nproportionality constant is given purely in terms of ratios\nof Wilson coefficients and CKM factors. For instance 22\n\n\u03c63 = \u03b3 from B 0 , Bs \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213\n\n3.1\n\nThe processes in (11) play a useful role in determining\n\u03b3. Here we describe a scheme based on K\u03c0 decays of\nB 0 and Bs mesons 17 . We will briefly comment on a\ncomplementary method using the other two processes.\nWriting the amplitudes for B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and\nBs \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + as in Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively, we note that the rates for these processes\nand their charge-conjugates depend on four quantities,\n\u2217\n|Vub\nVus Au |, |Vcb\u2217 Vcs Ac |, \u03b4K\u03c0 \u2261 Arg(Au A\u2217c ) and \u03b3 \u2261\n\u2217\n\u2217\nArg(\u2212Vub\nVud Vcb Vcd\n). Because of the equality of CP\nrate-differences in the two processes, a determination\nof \u03b3 requires another input. This input is provided by\n|A(B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + )| = |Vcb\u2217 Vcs Ac |, where small rescattering\ncorrections are neglected as argued above.\nDefining two charge-averaged ratios of rates\nR\u2261\n\n\u0393(B 0 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 )\n,\n\u0393(B \u00b1 \u2192 K\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n\nRs \u2261\n\n\u03c63 = \u03b3 from B \u00b1 \u2192 K\u03c0\n\n\u0393(Bs \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 )\n, (13)\n\u0393(B \u00b1 \u2192 K\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n\n(s)\n\nHEW P (15) = \u2212\n\nand CP violating pseudo-asymmetries\n\u2206(Bs \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\n\u2206(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n, As \u2261\n,\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u0393(B \u2192 K\u03c0 )\n\u0393(B \u00b1 \u2192 K\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n(14)\none finds\n\n(s)\n\n= \u2212\u03b4EW e\u2212i\u03b3 HCC (15) ,\n\nA0 \u2261\n\nR = 1 + r2 + 2r cos \u03b4K\u03c0 cos \u03b3\n\n,\n\nRs = tan \u03b8c2 + (r/ tan \u03b8c )2 \u2212 2r cos \u03b4K\u03c0 cos \u03b3\nA0 = \u2212As = \u22122r sin \u03b4K\u03c0 sin \u03b3 ,\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\n\u2217\n|Vub\nVus Au |/|Vcb\u2217 Vcs Ac |.\n\nwhere r \u2261\nSU(3) breaking can\nbe checked in (17) and used for improving the precision\nin \u03b3 obtained from these four quantities. It is estimated\n17\nthat a precision of 10\u25e6 in \u03b3 can be achieved in experiments to be performed at the Fermilab Tevatron Run II\nprogram 18 .\nAlternatively, one may compare time-dependence in\nthe U-spin related decays B 0 (t) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and Bs (t) \u2192\nK + K \u2212 19 . Here one is measuring in the two processes\nCP asymmetries of the form\nAsym(t) = Amix sin(\u2206mt) + Adir cos(\u2206mt) .\n\n(19)\n\nwhere (c9 + c10 )/(c1 + c2 ) \u2248 \u22121.12\u03b1, \u03b4EW = 0.65 \u00b1\n0.15. This SU(3) equality, implying a relation between\nhadronic amplitudes, simplifies the study of processes\ngoverned by 15 transitions.\nWhere does only 15 contribute? The answer to this\nquestion is simple 23 : In B \u2192 (K\u03c0)I=3/2 and in B + \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 where the final states are \"exotic\" and belong to\na 27 representation. The amplitude of the first proccess\ncan be written in terms of SU(3) graphical contributions\n\n(15)\n,\n\n3 c9 + c10 Vtb\u2217 Vts (s)\n\u2217 V HCC (15)\n2 c1 + c2 Vub\nus\n\n14\n\n\u221a\n(20)\nA(B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + ) + 2A(B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 ) =\nc\n\u2212(T + C + PEW + PEW\n) = \u2212(T + C)(1 \u2212 \u03b4EW e\u2212i\u03b3 ) .\nNote that the \u2206I = 0 penguin contributions dominating\nthe two amplitudes in the left-hand-side are equal and\ncancel by isospin alone. Hence the resulting SU(3) relation (20) applies to the subdominant current-current and\nelectroweak contributions.\nOne defines a charge-averaged ratio of rates 23\n\n(18)\n\nThe four measurables, Amix and Adir in the two processes, can be expressed in terms of \u03b2, \u03b3, the ratio of\npenguin and tree amplitudes in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and their\n\nR\u2217\u22121 \u2261\n3\n\n2[B(B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 ) + B(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 )]\n.

Expanding in subdominant contributions one derives the following inequality, to leading order\nin small quantities\n| cos \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4EW | \u2265\n\nR\u2217\u22121 |\n\n|1 \u2212\n2\u01eb\n\n,\n\nphase between A and \u0100 is \u03b3, their strong phase-difference\nwill be denoted \u03b4, Arg(A/\u0100) = \u03b4 + \u03b3, and the relative\nphase between aK\u03c0 and \u0101K\u03c0 (including a relative weak\nphase \u03c0) will be denoted \u2206K\u03c0 \u2261 Arg(aK\u03c0 /\u0101K\u03c0 ). Omitting a common phase space factor,\n\u0393(B + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )D K + ) = |Aa|2 + |\u0100\u0101|2\n+ 2|A\u0100a\u0101| cos(\u03b4 + \u2206 + \u03b3) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere a \u2261 aK\u03c0 , \u0101 \u2261 \u0101K\u03c0 , \u2206 \u2261 \u2206K\u03c0 .\nThe rate for the charge-conjugate process, B \u2212 \u2192\n+ \u2212\n(K \u03c0 )D K \u2212 , has a similar expression in which \u03b3 occurs\nwith an opposite sign, while strong phases are invariant under charge-conjugation. The CP asymmetry in\nthis process, involving an interference of Aa and \u0100\u0101, is\nproportional to sin(\u03b4 + \u2206) sin \u03b3, becoming maximal for\n|\u0100\u0101/Aa| = 1, \u03b4 + \u2206 = \u03c0/2.\nLet us summarize the present updated information\non the parameters appearing in Eqs. (26). The DCS\namplitude \u0101 was measured recently by CLEO 27 and by\nFOCUS 28 , resulting in an average value |\u0101K\u03c0 /aK\u03c0 | =\n(1.23 \u00b1 0.10) tan2 \u03b8c = 0.063 \u00b1 0.005. SU(3) symmetry\npredicts a value of tan2 \u03b8c 29 indicating some amount of\nSU(3) breaking in \u0101/a. Model-dependent studies of \u2206\nsuggest 30 that this phase, which vanishes in the SU(3)\nlimit, can be as large as about 20\u25e6 or be even larger.\nRecently a method was suggested 31 for measuring \u2206\nat a charm factory. This phase plays an important\n0\nrole in studies of D0 \u2212 D mixing. Finally, the ratio\nA/\u0100 is estimated, |A/\u0100| \u223c 0.1, using a CKM factor\n\u2217\n|Vub\nVcs |/|Vcb\u2217 Vus | \u2248 0.4 and a color-suppression factor of\nabout 0.25 measured in B \u2192 D\u0304\u03c0 decays 32 . The latter\nmeasurements also indicate a small value for \u03b4.\nWe conclude that the two amplitudes interfering in\nEqs. (26) are anticipated to be comparable in magnitude, |\u0100\u0101/Aa| \u223c 0.6 and to involve a possibly large relative strong phase \u03b4 + \u2206. This is crucial for a feasible\ndetermination of \u03b3 from the rate (26) and its chargeconjugate. To solve for \u03b3 requires observing another doubly Cabibbo-suppressed D0 decay mode. Such a study\nin the K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 channel is reported at this conference 33 .\nThis method requires a large number of B's, at least of\norder 108 \u2212109 since B(B + \u2192 D\u03040 K + )B(D\u03040 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) =\n(4.2 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10\u22128 .\n\nwhere 16\n\u01eb=\n\n\u2217\n|Vub\nVus | |T + C|\n=\n\u2217\n|Vtb Vts | |P + EW |\n\n\u221a Vus fK |A(B + \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + )|\n2\n= 0.20 \u00b1 0.05 .

The\nerror of the present average value 16 , R\u2217\u22121 = 1.45 \u00b1 0.46,\nought to be reduced before drawing firm conclusions\nabout allowed values of \u03b3. Further information about\n\u03b3, applying also to the case R\u2217\u22121 = 1, can be obtained by\nmeasuring separately B + and B \u2212 decay rates 24 . The solution obtained for \u03b3 involves uncertainties due to SU(3)\nbreaking in subdominant amplitudes and an uncertainty\nin |Vub /Vcb |, both of which affect the value of \u03b4EW . Combined with errors in \u01eb \u221d |A(B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 )/A(B + \u2192\nK 0 \u03c0 + )|, and in rescattering effects, one may expect to\nreach a precision in \u03b3 as small as 10 or 20 degrees 24 .\n3.3\n\n\u03c63 = \u03b3 from B \u2192 DK\n\nIn B + \u2192 DK + two amplitudes interfere due to colorfavored b\u0304 \u2192 c\u0304us\u0304 and color-suppressed b\u0304 \u2192 \u016bcs\u0304 transitions. The relative weak phase between the two amplitudes is \u03b3. We will describe two variants based in this\nuseful property which permits a measurement of \u03b3 25 . A\nbrief discussion is included of recent progress made in\nstudying relevant amplitudes and strong phases.\n(a) B decay to K and flavor specific D0 modes 26\nThe three-body decay B + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )D K + involves an\ninterference between two cascade amplitudes,\nAaK\u03c0 \u2261 A(B + \u2192 D0 K + )A(D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) ,\n\n(24)\n\n\u0100\u0101K\u03c0 \u2261 A(B + \u2192 D\u03040 K + )A(D\u03040 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) .\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\n(b) B decay to K and D0 CP-eigenstate modes 34\n\nNeglecting very small CP violation in D0 \u2212 D\u03040 mixing, one can write neutral D meson even/odd CP states\n0\n(decaying, for instance, to K + K \u2212 or KS \u03c0 0 ) as D\u00b1\n=\n\u221a\n0\n0\n(D \u00b1 D\u0304 )/ 2.

A combined\nrate measurement for B 0 and B\u0304 0 , avoiding the need for\nflavor tagging, is considerably easier. Such a measurement was shown 40 to imply useful upper bounds on \u03b8\nif the combined rate is sufficiently small. An interesting\nquestion 41 is whether it can also lead to a lower bound\non \u03b8, thereby constraining this angle tightly to a narrow\nrange (and consequently fixing \u03b1) for some values of the\ncombined \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 rate and the other measurables.\n\ncolor-favored neutral D flavor states\nR\u00b1 \u2261\n\n2[\u0393(B + \u2192 D\u00b1 K + ) + \u0393(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u00b1 K \u2212 )]\n, (28)\n\u0393(B + \u2192 D\u03040 K + ) + \u0393(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 )\n\nand two corresponding pseudo-asymmetries\nA\u00b1 \u2261\n\n\u0393(B + \u2192 D\u00b1 K + ) \u2212 \u0393(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u00b1 K \u2212 )\n.\n\u0393(B + \u2192 D\u03040 K + ) + \u0393(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 )\n\n(29)\n\nThese quantities do not require measuring the colorsuppressed rate \u0393(B + \u2192 D0 K + ) and its chargeconjugate.

However, a value\n|A/\u0100| \u223c 0.1 would be too small to be measured with\ngood precision.

Including measurements\nof the CP asymmetries A\u00b1 could further constrain \u03b3.\n3.4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our brief conclusion we wish to make a few general\nrecommendations for experimentalists. The experimental task becomes harder as we go down the list.\n\u2022 Measure crudely as many as possible CP asymmetries in hadronic and radiative B decays. Relative\nsigns of U-spin related asymmetries, which are relatively easily measured, test the CKM picture.\n\n\u03c62 = \u03b1 from B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\nThe phase \u03b1 = \u03c0\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b3 occurs in the time-dependent rate\nof B 0 (t) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and would dominate its asymmetry if\nonly a \"tree\" amplitude T contributes. A smaller penguin amplitude P , which carries a different weak phase,\nimplies a more general form of the time-dependent asymmetry, which includes in addition to the sin(\u2206mt) term\na cos(\u2206mt) term due to direct CP violation 3\nq\nA(t) = adir cos(\u2206mt) + 1 \u2212 a2dir sin 2(\u03b1 + \u03b8) sin(\u2206mt) .\n(32)\nThis provides two equations for three unknowns, adir , \u03b8\nand \u03b1, which is insufficient for measuring \u03b1. adir and\n\u03b8 can be expressed in terms of |P/T |, Arg(P/T ) and\n\u03b1. Consequently, knowledge of |P/T | or \u03b8 could provide\nvery useful information about \u03b1. Applying flavor SU(3)\nto measured B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and B \u2192 K\u03c0 decay rates 16 one\nfinds 35 |P/T | = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1. QCD based studies of |P/T |\n10,36\nobtain a small value around 0.1, however these calculations involve systematic theoretical uncertainties 37 .\nA clean way of eliminating the penguin effect 38 is by\nmeasuring also the time-integrated rates of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ,\n\n\u2022 Certain asymmetries are predicted by CKM to be\nvery small. Measuring sizable asymmetries in these\nchannels would be signals of new physics.\n\u2022 Measure precisely certain charge-averaged rates,\nwhich imply interesting constraints on \u03c63 = \u03b3.\n\u2022 Measure precisely those CP asymmetries from\nwhich \u03c61 = \u03b2, \u03c62 = \u03b1 and \u03c63 = \u03b3 can be determined in an accurate manner.\nThe final goal of measuring CP asymmetries in different\nprocesses is to test and overconstrain the CKM parameters in a manifold and critical manner, thereby opening\na window into new physics.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the Israel Science\nFoundation founded by the Israel Academy of Sciences\nand Humanities, and by the U.
