The Helfrich-Canham bending energy is identified with a non-linear\nsigma model for a unit vector. The identification, however, is dependent on one\nadditional constraint: that the unit vector be constrained to lie orthogonal to the\nsurface. The presence of this constraint adds a source to the divergence of the\nstress tensor for this vector so that it is not conserved. The stress tensor which is\nconserved is identified and its conservation shown to reproduce the correct shape\nequation.\n\nPACS numbers: 87.16.Dg, 46.70.Hg\n\nConsider an embedded two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional space. The\npositive definite geometrical invariant,\nZ\n1\nF [X] =\ndAKab K ab ,\n(1)\n2\nis a measure of the energy associated with the bending of the surface. The embedding\nis described by three functions X = X i of two variables \u03be a , (i, j, . . . = 1, 2, 3; a, b, . . . =\n1, 2). The extrinsic curvature tensor Kab is then defined by\nKab = eb * \u2207a n = Kba ,\na\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ea = \u2202X/\u2202\u03be = \u2207a X are the two tangent vectors to the surface and n is the\nunit normal. Indices are raised with g ab , the inverse of the induced metric gab = ea *eb .\n\u221a\ndA = gd2 \u03be is the area measure induced on the surface by X, with g =det gab .\nFor a two-dimensional surface F [X] is invariant under ambient space conformal\ntransformations. Since its introduction by Willmore [1], it has cropped up in a number\nof contexts. These range from elasticity theory [2], to cellular biophysics where it\nmodels the bending energy of phospholipid membranes and is known as the HelfrichCanham Hamiltonian [3, 4, 5], to its Lorentzian generalization describing the action\ndefined on the two-dimensional world sheet of a relativistic string propagating in\nspacetime, proposed by Polyakov to model colour flux tubes in QCD [6, 7, 8]. We will\ncouch our discussion in terms of Euclidean surfaces.\nThe vanishing of the first variation of F [X] under an infinitesimal deformation of\nthe embedding functions, X \u2192 X + \u03b4X, produces the shape equation [9, 10]\n1\n(3)\n\u2212 \u22072 K + K(K 2 \u2212 2Kab K ab ) = 0 ,\n2\nwhere \u22072 is the surface Laplacian, and K = g ab Kab is the mean extrinsic curvature.\nWe remark that the shape equation is of fourth order in derivatives of the shape\n\n\fHelfrich-Canham bending energy as a constrained non-linear sigma model\n\n2\n\nfunctions. Let us also note that, a fact that will be used below, the shape equation\ncan be written as a conservation law [11, 12],\n\u2207a f a = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the stress tensor f a is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\na\nab\nab\nf = K K \u2212 Kg\neb \u2212 (\u2207a K) n .\n2\n\n(5)\n\nIn this brief report, we would like to explore the fact that it is possible to rewrite\nthe quadratic appearing in (1) in the form\nKab K ab = (\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n) ,\n\n(6)\n\nan identity which follows immediately from the definition of Kab and use of the\ncompleteness of the basis {ea , n}, g ab eia ejb = \u03b4 ij \u2212 ni nj . This identity associates\nbending energy with non-vanishing gradients of the normal vector; it appears to map\nthe bending energy into a non-linear sigma model living on the curved geometry of\nthe surface (see e.g. Ch. 14 of [13]):\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nF\u03c3 [n] =\ndA (\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n) + \u03bb(n2 \u2212 1) ,\n(7)\n2\nwith \u03bb a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the constraint that n be a unit vector. The\nEuler-Lagrange equations that follow from the vanishing of the first variation of F\u03c3 [n]\nunder n \u2192 n + \u03b4n are\n\u2212 \u22072 n + \u03bbn = 0 ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212 \u22072 n \u2212 (\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n) n = 0 .\n\n(9)\n\n2\n\ntogether with the constraint n = 1. Using this constraint, the Lagrange multiplier is\nidentified as \u03bb = \u2212(\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n), so that the Euler-Lagrange equations take the form\n\nThese equations are integrable [14]; this fact is one motivation for investigating possible\nlinks with the bending energy (1).\nIf n happens to be the unit normal to some surface, then the fact that \u2207a n =\nKab g bc ec , and the Codazzi-Mainardi identities \u2207a K ab = \u2207b K, allow us to rewrite the\nEuler-Lagrange equations in a geometrical form as \u2207a K = 0. Clearly, this is not even\na distant relative of the shape equation (3). It is of second order in derivatives of n,\nand of third order in derivatives of X. Despite this fact, unfortunately, this erronous\nidentification has been made frequently in the literature; not by Polyakov, though,\nwho was well aware of the pitfalls of a hasty identification (see Sect. 10.4 of [7]).\nWhat F\u03c3 [n] fails to do is to capture the fact that n is normal to the surface. If n may\npoint in any direction, then F\u03c3 [n] describes a Heisenberg ferromagnet on the surface.\nOn the other hand, if we wish to describe the bending energy, the unit vector n must\nalso satisfy the constraints\nn * ea = 0 .\n\n(10)\n\nIf the surface is fixed n is also; if n is allowed to vary, the surface must respond\naccordingly. This leads to an interesting reformulation of the bending energy. We\nintroduce the novel functional, with additional constraints,\n\u0014\nZ\n\u03bb\n1\n(\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n) + (n2 \u2212 1)\nF [n, ea , X] =\ndA\n2\n2\n+ \u03bba (n * ea ) + f a * (ea \u2212 \u2207a X)] .\n(11)\n\n\f3\n\nHelfrich-Canham bending energy as a constrained non-linear sigma model\n\nThe normalization n2 = 1 and orthogonality constraints (10) are implemented using\nthe Lagrange multipliers \u03bb and \u03bba , respectively. The latter constraints may be thought\nof as a frustration of the non-linear sigma model. They would be simple enough to\nimplement if the ea were any two fixed vector fields. The fact that the vectors ea\nare the tangent vectors to the surface, however, couples n not only to them, but also\nthrough them to the embedding functions X themselves; this connection is captured\nin the final set of constraints in (11). This model is a special case of a general\nconstruction introduced by one of us in [12], where the issue of implementing the\nnecessary integrability conditions needed for the surface to exist is sidestepped.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations for n, ea and X, that follow from the vanishing\nof the first variation of F [n, ea , X], together are completely equivalent to the shape\nequation (3). Moreover, the Lagrange multipliers f a appearing in (11) coincide with\nthe stress tensor (5) \u2013 this justifies the abuse of notation. How the shape equation\ncomes out is rather interesting. First, the Euler-Lagrange equation for the embedding\nfunctions X provides the conservation law (4), \u2207a f a = 0, since X appears only in\nthe last constraint. The equations for n, and ea determine the form of the Lagrange\nmultipliers f a : for n we have\n\u2212 \u22072 n + \u03bbn + \u03bba ea = 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\nf a = T ab eb \u2212 \u03bba n ,\n\n(13)\n\nand for ea , when the constraints are enforced,\nwhere we identify the stress tensor associated with an unconstrained non-linear sigma\nmodel for n on the background intrinsic geometry of the surface\n1\nT ab = (\u2207a n) * (\u2207b n) \u2212 g ab (\u2207c n) * (\u2207c n) .\n(14)\n2\nIf \u03bba = 0, (12) reproduces the Euler-Lagrange equations for a non-linear sigma model\n(8). The normal projection of (12) gives, as before, \u03bb = \u2212(\u2207a n) * (\u2207a n) , or \u03bb is\n(minus) the energy density; taking into account the constraint (10), its tangental\ncounterparts give\n\u03bba = ea * \u22072 n = \u2207b (ea * \u2207b n) = \u2207b K a b = \u2207a K .\n\n(15)\nab\n\nModulo the constraints (10) and the definition of Kab , we find that T can be\nrewritten as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 ab cd\n1 ab\nab\nab\nac\nb\nT = K Kc \u2212 g K Kcd = K K \u2212 g K .\n(16)\n2\n2\nTo obtain the expression on the right we have used the Gauss-Codazzi equation for a\ntwo-dimensional surface,\n1\nRgab = KKab \u2212 Kac K c b ,\n(17)\n2\nwhich expresses the Ricci scalar induced by X, equal to twice the Gaussian curvature,\nin terms of a quadratic in Kab . Therefore, inserting (15) for \u03bba and (16) for T ab\ninto the Euler-Lagrange equation for ea (13), we reproduce the stress tensor (5). We\nidentify \u03bba as the normal stress and T ab as the tangential stress in the membrane.\nTo arrive at the shape equation, let us return now to the conservation law (4).\nUsing (13), we can re-express the conservation law in terms of tangential and normal\ncomponents:\n\u2207a \u03bba + K ab Tab = 0 ,\n\n\u2207a T\n\nab\n\n\u2212 \u03bba K\n\nab\n\n= 0.\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n\f4\n\nHelfrich-Canham bending energy as a constrained non-linear sigma model\n\nUsing (15) for \u03bba and (16) for T ab , it is immediate to see that the first, normal,\ncomponent coincides with the shape equation (3). The coupling of n to the tangents\nprovides a source to the sigma model stress tensor: it is no longer conserved. The\nsource is the Lagrange multiplier \u03bba implementing the constraint (15). When \u03bba is\nsubstituted into (19), it is identically satisfied, a feature that has its origin in the\nreparametrization invariance of the model. We note that the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb\ndoes not appear in these equations. We also remark on the fact that we do not need\nto know how Kab itself responds to a deformation of the surface in this presentation.\nWhat is the status of the Euler-Lagrange equation for n? Substituting \u03bb and\n\u03bba into (12) we obtain a purely kinematical statement about embedded geometries\nidentifying what the projections of \u22072 n are with respect to the basis vectors, ea and\nn:\n\u22072 n = (\u2207a K)ea \u2212 K ab Kab n .\n\n(20)\nb\n\nTo see this, just take a divergence of the Weingarten equations \u2207a n = Kab e using\nthe Gauss equations \u2207a eb = \u2212Kab n to express \u2207a eb as a normal vector.\nThere is a second independent quadratic invariant in the extrinsic curvature,\ninvolving the square of the mean curvature, K 2 . However, it does not lend itself to\na simple expression of the form (6). On the other hand, the fully contracted GaussCodazzi equation,\nR = K 2 \u2212 Kab K ab ,\n\n(21)\n\nidentifies the difference between the two quadratics with the scalar curvature, defined\nintrinsically i.e. independent of the normal n. For a two-dimensional surface,\nthe corresponding invariant is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. In higher\ndimensions, the difference is still independent of n. As a result, both \u03bb and \u03bba are\nunchanged with respect to the values given above.\nWe note, in this context, that the winding number of n is\nZ\n1\ndA\u01ebab \u01ebijk ni \u2207a nj \u2207b nk ,\n(22)\nQ=\n8\u03c0\nwhere \u01ebab and \u01ebijk are respectively the Levi-Civita tensors on the surface and in space\n[15]. Modulo (21), Q is just the Gauss-Bonnet invariant of the surface. Thus once the\nconstraint is implemented, the winding number is fixed by the topology of the surface.\nTo summarize, it has been shown that the coupling of a sigma model to the\ngeometry constraining the unit vector n to lie normal to the surface converts it into\nthe Helfrich-Canham model - involving only the surface geometry. A lot is known\nabout both models. One expects that this identification might allow results from one\nmodel to be imported into the other. In particular, one would expect this formulation\nof the Helfrich-Canham model to be potentially useful in statistical mechanics. The\nfunctional F [X, n, ea ] defined by (11) is quadratic in n. This suggests that, in the\nevaluation of the partition function, n may be integrated out. This possible virtue of\nthe formulation presented in this paper will be the subject of future work.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Markus Deserno for helpful comments.
