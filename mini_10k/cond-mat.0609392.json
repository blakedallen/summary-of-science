We calculate\nthe potential energy per atom corresponding to absolute zero disorder temperature, and\nthe energy needed to create a shear transformation zone.\n\n1\n\n\fBeing able to correctly model the physics of plastic deformation is critically\nimportant for understanding the mechanical failure modes of materials. Research into the\ndynamics of plasticity in metals has traditionally considered the dynamics of crystalline\ndislocations [1]. However a significant number of complications arise in the analysis of\nheavily dislocated and polycrystalline solids, and the systematic development of a\nstatistical mechanics of deformation based on dislocation plasticity remains a grand\nchallenge. Less attention has been paid to the plastic responses of metallic glasses [2-8].\nYet insight into the statistical mechanics of plastic flow in such amorphous solids may\naid in the construction of theories of plasticity in general.\nIn previous studies of the system simulated here we observed that samples\nprepared at sufficiently slow quench rates undergo an instability resulting in two\ncoexisting regions: a shear band that contributes nearly all the plastic flow, and a jammed\nregion that undergoes negligible plastic deformation[9, 10]. The bifurcation of the\nmechanical response exhibited in simulation appears to be closely related to the\ndevelopment of shear bands in metallic glasses. Being that these shear bands represent\nthe primary failure mode in that material system they have been extensively studied\nexperimentally [11-15]. Here we drive the system at constant strain rate in a \"simple\nshear\" geometry to achieve very large strains. This loading geometry results in a uniform\nstress across the sample, and allows us to average across parallel layers to collect\nadequate statistics for verifying theoretical predictions.\nIt is important to note that during plastic deformation significant amounts of heat\nare generated. However, recent experimental investigations indicate that the origin of\nshear bands in metallic glasses is not a thermo-mechanical softening of the material, as in\n2\n\n\fhigh rate of deformation in steels, but rather it arises due to structural softening [16, 17].\nAfter shear band slip has initiated, however, heating may play a significant role in late\nstages of slip. The purpose of this investigation is to consider the processes that control\nshear band initiation, and in order to minimize the thermal effects we purposely simulate\na system in which cooling is applied at a high rate throughout the sample.\nThere presently exist a number of theoretical predictions for the mechanical\nresponse of metallic glasses [ 2, 5, 7, 18, 19], making it difficult to perform a complete\ncomparative study. Instead we choose to consider one theoretical assumption present in a\nwide variety of theories[ 2, 18, 19], but which, as far as we are aware, has never been\ndirectly validated in experiment or simulation. These theories assume that the structural\nstates of the glass, which have fallen out of equilibrium with the bath, obey Poisson\nstatistics. The earliest instance of this assumption of which we are aware is the theory of\nCohen and Turnbull[20] used by Spaepen to construct his theory of metallic glass\ndeformation[2]. Theories that follow in this vein[ 19, 21] assume that the distribution of\n\"free volume\" controls the flow rate. Recently Langer [18] and Lemaitre [22] have\nquestioned whether a quasi-thermodynamic interpretation is preferable. Simulation\nresults have indeed illustrated that zero temperature systems under shear may behave in a\nway typically associated with thermally equilibrated systems, i.e. they may be well\ndescribed by an \"effective temperature\" [23, 24]. It is of considerable theoretical interest\nto determine which of these assumptions hold.\nIn order to analyze our simulation results we will assume that, since the\nsimulations are performed at very low temperature, the rate of thermal relaxation of the\nstructural state is negligible outside the shear band. Also, we will assume that any internal\n3\n\n\fdegrees of freedom, other than a single scalar parameter that governs the distribution of\nstructural states, equilibrate quickly by comparison. For example in the context of the\nshear transformation zone (STZ) theory an evolving distribution of defects known as\nSTZs naturally result in phenomena such as jamming and hysteresis [5]. Here we assume\nthat the number and orientations of the STZs maintain their steady state values. We will\nalso assume convection is negligible.\nIn this limit the free volume theory that Heggen, Spaepen and Feuerbacher\napplied to model the behavior of Pd41Ni10Cu29P20 [8], the theory of Lemaitre and Carlson\n[21] and the disorder temperature theory of Langer [18] reduce to nearly the same\nfunctional form. These consist of two equations, one that relates the local plastic strain\nrate, \u03b5& pl , to the shear stress, s, and the structural state, \u03c7, through an equation of the form\n\n\u03b5& pl = e \u22121 / \u03c7 f (s ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nand a second equation that provides the evolution of the structural state,\nc0 \u03c7& = 2 s\u03b5& pl (\u03c7 \u221e \u2212 \u03c7 ) \u2212 k ( \u03c7 ,T ) .\n\n(2)\n\nIn the above equations f(s) is a monotonic function of stress; the parameter c0 is a\nquantity with units of energy density; the dimensionless parameter \u03c7 \u221e is the upper\nlimiting value of \u03c7, and the function k is the rate of thermal relaxation, discussed below.\nAlthough these theories lead to similar equations, the interpretation of \u03c7 differs. In the\ndisorder temperature formalism this parameter is defined as \u03c7 \u2261 kBTd E Z , where kB is\nthe Boltzmann factor; Td is the disorder temperature that characterizes energy distribution\nof configurations in the glass, and EZ is a typical energy required to create an STZ. In the\n4\n\n\ffree volume model \u03c7 \u2261 v f \u03b3 v* is known as the reduced free volume, where vf is the free\nvolume, v* is a critical free volume and \u03b3 is a parameter of order unity. This difference is\nnot, in principle, irreconcilable since the free volume could be related in important ways\nto the disorder temperature.\nDespite their similarities the theories cited above are distinct in notable ways. Eq.\n(2) implies that in flowing regions \u03c7 converges to a limiting value \u03c7 \u221e in the absence of\nthermal relaxation. This feature is present only in the analysis by Langer. The second\ndifference arises in the functional form of k, the rate of thermal relaxation, that depends\non both \u03c7 and the temperature. Spaepen and Heggen, et al. assume due to binary\nannihilation k \u221d \u2212e \u22121 \u03c7 (e \u22121 \u03c7 \u2212 e \u2212 E Z\n\nkT\n\n). Langer proposes that k \u221d \u2212e\n\n\u2212\u03b2 \u03c7\n\n(\u03c7 \u2212 ),\nkT\nEZ\n\nwhich is similar to the form employed by Lemaitre, et al. Since we are operating at very\nlow temperature and our interest is confined to relaxations occurring inside the shear\nband, both can be approximated as\nk (\u03c7 ,T ) \u2248 \u03ba exp (\u2212 \u03b2 \u03c7 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba is a kinetic constant, and \u03b2 is a parameter. The third distinguishing feature is the\nform of f(s), which exhibits a dynamical transition from jamming to flow at finite stress\nonly in the STZ theory. However, the form of f(s) has no consequence in this analysis.\nWe have performed molecular dynamics simulation in a two-dimensional model\nof a binary alloy that was originally developed in the context of quasi-crystals [25]. We\nhave simulated this system in numerous other investigations of the plastic deformation of\nglasses, and refer the reader to these sources for the details of the atomic interactions and\n\n5\n\n\fthe composition of the system [5, 9, 10]. All energies are expressed in terms of \u03b5SL, the\nenergy of the bond between an atom of the two species, denoted S for small and L for\nlarge. Lengths are expressed in terms of a reference length scale, \u03c3SL, the distance at\nwhich the SL interaction energy is zero. The mode coupling temperature, a good upper\nbound for the glass transition temperature, has been calculated to be TMCT \u2248 0.325 \u03b5 SL k .\nTemperatures will be expressed in terms of TMCT. All the particles have the same mass,\nm0. The reference time scale will therefore be t0 = \u03c3 SL m0 \u03b5 SL .\nThe systems used here span a square box 286.26 \u03c3SL on a side and consist of\n80,000 atoms with 35,776 L atoms and 44,224 S atoms. The initial conditions were\ncreated starting from supercooled liquids equilibrated at 1.08 TMCT. The temperature of\nthe liquid was then reduced to 9.2% of TMCT isochorically. We begin the mechanical tests\nfrom nine independent glass configurations created by lowering the temperature over one\nof three different quenching times, which we will denote Quench I (100,000 t0), Quench\nII (50,000 t0) or Quench III (10,000 t0). In this way we are able to consider sample-tosample variations. The average potential energies per atom are -2.507, -2.497 and -2.477\n\n\u03b5SL for Quench I, II and III, respectively.\nSimple shear is induced by incrementally deforming the simulation cell. To avoid\nthe artifacts such a transformation causes at very large strain, we integrate the SLLOD\nequations of motion [26] and apply Lees-Edwards boundary conditions [27]. Full\nperiodicity is maintained along all boundaries. In keeping with the simple shear geometry\nall shear stresses and shear strain rates will refer to the magnitude of the shear in the\ndirection of the applied loading, i.e. sxy and \u03b5&xy \u2261 \u2202 2u x (2\u2202y\u2202t ) .\n6\n\n\fDuring shearing, the temperature is maintained at 9.2% TMCT by coupling to a\nNose-Hoover thermostat [28]. This can be interpreted as analogous to cooling a thin film\nsample from the exposed surface. Due to the high rate of cooling temperatures remain\nwell below the glass transition temperature. Three strain rates are employed: 0.00002,\n0.0001 and 0.0005 t0\u22121 . For the lowest shear rates, the temperature in the shear band rises\nto about 11% TMCT, only slightly higher than the surrounding material. Even for the\nfastest shear rates, the temperatures never reach even 1/3 of TMCT. Thus the material in\nthe band remains well below the glass transition temperature. Careful analysis indicates\nthat 98-99% of the mechanical work done on the system is dissipated as heat. This is in\nagreement with the experimental estimate of Heggen, et. al. [8]. The maximum shear\nstrain is 1000%. Fig. 1 shows the stress strain curves for one sample prepared at each of\nQuench I, II and III and tested at a strain rate of 0.00002 t0\u22121 .\nIn order to investigate the effects of strain rate and sample preparation, we\ncalculated the distribution of shear strain at 50% total applied strain using the method\ndetailed in [5] as shown in Fig. 2. High strain rate promotes homogenous deformation via\nmultiple shear bands, consistent with our observations in previous uniaxial tensile tests\n[10]. The deformation in Fig. 2 is quite similar for Quench I, II and III due to a narrower\nrange of quenching rates than our previous parametric study.\nOnce initiated, shear bands typically lead to fracture, but in simple shear the shear\nband can evolve to extremely high strains. In Fig. 3a we have quantified the evolution of\nthe strain rate profile in a shear band by measuring displacements of atoms in 50\nhorizontal slices at strain intervals of 100%. Fig. 3b demonstrates that we can also detect\nthe band by examining the local potential energy per atom.\n7\n\n\fIn the disorder temperature model Td is a temperature in some thermodynamically\nmeaningful sense. Consequently it should be possible to relate \u03c7 to the local potential\nenergy. Here we assume that \u03c7 is a linear function of the potential energy per atom.\nC1 \u03c7 = PE \u2212 PE0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere PE is the potential energy; PE0 is the potential energy per atom for ideally\njammed regions, and C1 is a quantity with units of energy per atom that is equal to\n\nm0 E Z k times a specific heat that relates the internal energy to the disorder temperature.\nWhen the system is loaded in simple shear, the material inside and outside the\nband are held at the same average shear stress by construction due to mechanical\nequilibrium. Therefore if we divide the strain rate at a given y position by the strain rate\nat the center of the shear band, \u03b5&b , where the value of \u03c7 is equal to \u03c7 b , Eq.

By solving Eqs. (1)-(3) for the steady\nstate value of \u03c7, the value of \u03c7 b can be expressed as a function of the strain rate in the\nband. Taking this expression and Eqs. (4) and (5) we find that\n\n\u23a1 \u03b5& ( y )\u23a4\n1\nC1\nln \u23a2 pl\n\u2212\n=\n\u23a5\n\u22121\nPE0 \u2212 PE ( y )\n\u23a3 \u03b5&b \u23a6 \u03c7 \u221e \u2212 r\u03b5&b\n\n(6)\n\nHere we have expanded the value of \u03c7 b around \u03c7 \u221e assuming high strain rates in the\nband; r is the resulting rate constant that depends on \u03ba, \u03c7 \u221e , \u03b2 and the functional form of f.\n8\n\n\fThis scaling relationship should hold irrespective of the stage of the deformation process\nor the location in the material.\nFig. 4 shows the left-hand side of Eq. (6) as determined from the local strain rates\nplotted versus potential energy. Each data point is calculated from the strain rate and\npotential energy of horizontal slices of material 5.72 \u03c3SL thick. Slices are taken from\nsimulations every 100% strain from 200% to 1000%. The data is averaged over 50 data\npoints ordered by potential energy per atom. This includes data extracted from simulation\nresults for all three initial conditions from each of the three quench times. Each pane\nrepresents the data from a different applied strain rate. Here we have estimated \u03c7 \u221e to be\n0.1548 and r to be 3.565 \u00d7 10\u22124 t0\u22121 . Data collapse is evident for data from all 9 simulations\nat all strains over a 3 order of magnitude range of local strain rates. The solid line in each\nfigure represents the functional form shown on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) when we\nestimate PE0 to be -2.58 \u03b5SL and C1 to be 1.15 \u03b5SL. Our ability to fit nearly all the data\nusing Eq. (6) provides strong confirmation of the theoretical framework discussed above.\nThe one systematic exception occurs at the highest shear rates for the highest and lowest\npotential energies. This data comes from the earliest strains. As illustrated in Fig. 2,\nmultiple shear bands are evident in these cases. So this deviation should be expected.\nThrough our analysis of these simulations, a surprisingly consistent picture of\nplastic deformation in glassy materials appears to emerge. The ability of Eq. (1) to\ndescribe the deformation behavior when the state variable \u03c7 is interpreted as being\nlinearly related to the potential energy per atom is consistent with a quasi-thermodynamic\ninterpretation of this quantity. Edwards, Langer and Lemaitre have all argued for the\n\n9\n\n\fexistence of such a quantity, related to the entropy, that characterizes the number of paths\navailable to the system[18, 22, 29]. This conceptual framework could form the basis of a\nthermodynamics of the \"jammed\" state of glasses and granular materials. Such an\ninterpretation would potentially shed light on the value of PE0, the degree of structural\nrelaxation corresponding to \"absolute zero\" disorder temperature. This ideally jammed\nstate could be \"randomly dense packed\" or crystalline. The crystalline ground state for\nthis system has a PE of -2.60 \u03b5SL, very close to our PE0 value of -2.58 \u03b5SL.\nOur analysis has indicated that in the regime of importance for these simulations\nthe potential energy per atom and the free volume are linearly related. From this one\ncould argue that the two formalisms are interchangeable. However, it is only in the\ncontext of the thermodynamic interpretation that the value of the energy per STZ can be\nextracted from \u03c7 \u221e . If we make the assumption that Td must be equal to Tg \u2248 TMCT in the\nshear band in the limit of high strain rate, then we can estimate E Z \u2248 kTMCT \u03c7 \u221e = 2.1\u03b5 SL ,\nabout 2-4 atomic bonds in strength. This energy scale is consistent with the STZ concept\nas originated by Argon [3], and is crucially important for understanding the kinds of\nelementary processes that control deformation.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge support of the NSF under award DMR0135009 and PHY99-07949.
