From a theoretical standpoint, \u03b7-photoproduction\nprovides a useful method to examine the properties of certain nucleon resonances. In particular,\nsince the \u03b7 meson is a spin- and isospin-zero particle, its coupling to nucleons can lead to the formation of only isospin- 21 nucleon resonances. Using nuclear targets, \u03b7-photoproduction can be used\nto investigate the modification of hadron properties in the nuclear medium. These reactions can\nalso be used to study the final-state interactions of \u03b7 mesons with nuclei, another topic of current\ninterest. Reactions on nuclei can complement and further test information obtained from studying\nphotoproduction reactions on free nucleons.\nIn recent years, there have been several theoretical treatments of coherent \u03b7-photoproduction\nreactions on nuclei. Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel [1] used an effective Lagrangian approach (ELA) to examine\nthe free \u03b7-photoproduction process, using only the S11 (1535) and D13 (1520) resonances, as well as\nt-channel vector meson exchange and nucleon pole terms. From these results, they obtained cross\nsections for coherent \u03b7-photoproduction on 4 He and 12 C in the near-threshold region. Peters et al. [2]\nused an ELA with a relativistic, non-local model to study coherent \u03b7-photoproduction on spin-zero\nnuclei. They also compared several optical potentials for the \u03b7 final-state interactions. Piekarewicz\net al. [3, 4] used a relativistic ELA to examine coherent \u03b7-photoproduction on 4 He, 12 C, and 40 Ca.\nBennhold and Tanabe [5] used a coupled channel isobar model, in which the (\u03b3, \u03b7) reaction is related\nto the (\u03b3, \u03c0), (\u03c0, \u03b7), (\u03c0, \u03c0), and (\u03b7, \u03b7) reactions. They used the resulting elementary amplitude\nto study coherent and incoherent photoproduction of \u03b7 mesons on nuclei. The term incoherent\nphotoproduction, as introduced by these authors, refers to reactions leading to excited states of the\nfinal nucleus. We adopt this same definition in the present work.\nThe paper by Bennhold and Tanabe constitutes the only existing theoretical treatment of incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction. The small cross sections they obtained, relative to the dominant quasifree\n\u03b7-photoproduction process, indicate that these processes are out of reach for the current generation\nof experiments. Furthermore, nuclear structure complications have curtailed theoretical interest in\nincoherent reactions. To date, only inclusive measurements have been made for \u03b7-photoproduction\non complex nuclei [6]. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of the process better, these\nmeasurements will need to be complemented by quasifree, coherent, and incoherent measurements.\n1\n\n\fIn this paper we extend a previous relativistic model for quasifree photoproduction of \u03b7 mesons\non complex nuclei [7, 8] to the case of incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction. The main ingredients of the\npresent treatment are as follows. The effective Lagrangian of Benmerrouche et al. [9] is used for the\ninteractions between fields. Contributions from the nucleon Born diagrams, t-channel vector mesons,\nand the S11 and D13 nucleon resonances are included. The nuclear wavefunctions are solutions of\nthe Dirac equation with strong scalar and vector potentials in the spirit of the relativistic mean field\ntheory of Walecka [10, 11]. Calculations are carried out in the plane wave approximation (PWA)\nand also in the distorted wave approximation (DWA) in which the final-state interactions of the \u03b7\nmeson are taken into account.\nIn the following section, we outline the calculations for the amplitude and observables of an incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction reaction. In Sec. 3 we discuss the parameters that are used in the effective\nLagrangian. The results of the calculations are presented and discussed in Sec. 4. Conclusions are\ngiven in Sec. 5.\n\n2\n\nReaction Model\n\nIn an incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction reaction, a photon interacts with a nucleus to produce an \u03b7\nmeson and raise the nucleus from its ground state to an excited state. In the impulse approximation,\nmany-body contributions are neglected so that the production takes place on a single nucleon. In\nthis approximation, the transition amplitude for the incoherent reaction A(\u03b3, \u03b7)A\u2217 is closely related\nto that of the elementary reaction N(\u03b3, \u03b7)N.\nThe starting point in the present approach is a relativistic interaction Lagrangian for a system of\nphotons, mesons, nucleons, and nucleon resonances from which one obtains the transition amplitude\nfor the A(\u03b3, \u03b7)A\u2217 reaction. The amplitude is then used to calculate the observables for the reaction.\nIn the photoproduction of \u03b7 mesons from complex nuclei, the reaction takes place within the\nnuclear medium. The dynamics of the nucleons within the nuclear matter are described by the\nrelativistic mean field Lagrangian of Walecka [10, 11]. The \u03b7 meson is described by solutions of the\nKlein-Gordon equation. The interactions of the fields involved in the reaction are described by the\ninteraction Lagrangian\nLINT = L\u03b7N N + L\u03b3N N + LV \u03b7\u03b3 + LV N N + L\u03b7N R + L\u03b3N R .\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fWe use the effective Lagrangian of Benmerrouche et al. [9], using pseudoscalar coupling for the\n\u03b7NN vertex. The terms in (1) can be written explicitly as:\nL\u03b7N N = \u2212ig\u03b7N N \u03c8\u03b35 \u03c8\u03b7 ,\n\n(2)\n\ne\u03bap\n\u03c8\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c8 ,\n4M\ngt\nLV N N = \u2212gv \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc V \u03bc \u03c8 \u2212\n\u03c8\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd V \u03bc\u03bd \u03c8 ,\n4M\ne\u03bbv\nLV \u03b7\u03b3 =\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 F \u03bc\u03bd V \u03bb\u03c3 \u03b7 .\n4m\u03b7\nL\u03b3N N = \u2212e\u03c8\u03b3\u03bc A\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nAt the V NN vertex, we use a form factor of the type\nF (t) =\n\n\u039b2 \u2212 m2V\n\u039b2 \u2212 t\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u039b2 = 1.2 GeV2 .

Finally, \u0393(j) is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix operator which\ncontains the details of the interaction relevant to a particular reaction channel, labeled by (j). The\nexplicit forms for \u0393proton , \u0393S11 , \u0393D13 , and \u0393V are given in [7].\nWe carry out two types of calculations depending on whether or not the final-state interactions\nof the \u03b7 are taken into account. In the PWA, we neglect final-state interactions so the \u03b7 meson\nwavefunction takes the form\n\u03a6\u03b7 (x) = e\u2212ik\u03b7 *x .\n\n(16)\n\nIn the DWA, the \u03b7 meson wavefunction is distorted through the use of an optical potential in the\nKlein-Gordon equation. In our DWA calculations, we will use two different optical potentials. The\nfirst optical potential, which we will denote DW1, was introduced by Lee et al. [12] using the \u03b7N\nscattering amplitude found by Bennhold and Tanabe [5]. The second optical potential, which we\nwill label DW3, was introduced by Peters et al.

In particular, experimental studies of the elementary \u03b7-photoproduction reaction p(\u03b3, \u03b7)p\nallow us to constrain our parameter set.\nThe parameters relating to the S11 and D13 resonances are the most crucial inputs for our\neffective Lagrangian. By considering the decays of these resonances through the \u03b3p and \u03b7p channels, we can relate the parameters in equations (7) through (11) to more conventional resonance\nparameters [9]. For example, for the S11 resonance,\n|e\u03baS11 | =\n\n|g\u03b7N S11 | =\n\nv\nu\nu 2M(MS11\nt\n\n(MS11\n\n+ M)\nAp1/2 ,\n\u2212 M)\n\n4\u03c0MS11\n\u0393S \u2192\u03b7N\np\u03b7 (EN + M) 11\n\n!1/2\n\n(22)\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere Ap1/2 is a helicity amplitude, and p\u03b7 and EN are the momentum of the \u03b7 and the energy of the\nnucleon, respectively, in the center of momentum frame for the decay S11 \u2192 \u03b7N. Similar expressions\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ncan be written for f\u03b7N D13 \u03baD13 and f\u03b7N D13 \u03baD13 . While these expressions specify the magnitudes of\nthe resonance parameters, they do not provide us with any information about their phases.\nIn the present analysis we shall compare three slightly different sets of coupling parameters for the\neffective Lagrangians involving the resonances. Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel [1] obtained a set of parameters\nthat gave a good description of the elementary cross sections measured at Mainz [14]. We were able\nto reproduce their results using a certain set of phases for the extracted coupling parameters. As\na further test of these parameters, we compared our predictions for the photon asymmetry of the\nelementary process to the results obtained by a recent experiment at the ESRF [15]. Figure 1 shows\nour prediction, along with the experimental results, for the photon asymmetry when E\u03b3 = 740 MeV.\nThe parameters are listed as set 1 in Table 1. Note that this set is given only for protons; the handling\nof neutron cross sections in this particular case is explained in the following section. Peters et al. [2]\nhave also used the Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel parameters to extract the coupling parameters for both\nprotons and neutrons. The proton parameters are only slightly different from those mentioned\nabove and the neutron parameters are based on the 1996 listings of the Particle Data Group (these\nare also the same in the 2000 listings). These coupling parameters are listed as set 2 in Table 1.\nThe proton parameters in Set 3 in Table 1 are based on the recent analysis of Tiator et al. [16] of\nseveral observables for the photoproduction process on proton targets. This analysis produced new\n6\n\n\fparameters for the D13 . In particular these authors find a much smaller branching ratio than that\nused by Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel. The rest of the coupling parameters are the same as for set 2. We shall\ncompare the cross sections calculated using these three sets of parameters.\n\n4\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nIn order to put our final results into proper perspective we need to discuss two relevant issues. The\ncross sections for the incoherent process depend strongly on the isospin of the excited state. For\nisospin-zero targets we calculate these cross sections for both Tf = 0 and Tf = 1 nuclear excited\nstates. We explain here how these calculations are done for the three sets of coupling parameters\ndiscussed above. Set 1 lists only the coupling parameters for protons (see Table 1). The calculations\nof the isospin dependent cross sections in this case make use of the experimental results from Mainz\nfor \u03b7-photopoduction on the proton [14] and the deuteron [17]. An analysis by these authors, based\non the dominance of the S11 resonance, established a neutron to proton cross section ratio. From\nthis ratio the amplitude for the elementary process can be decomposed into isovector and isoscalar\ncomponents. Specifically, based on the analysis by Krusche et al. [17], we take the ratio of the\nneutron to proton amplitudes to be \u22120.80. In our calculations we use the parameters of set 1 to\nobtain the contributions from the target protons to the incoherent amplitudes and use the above\nratio to calculate the neutron contributions. These amplitudes can then be combined to yield the\nT = 0 or T = 1 amplitudes. This procedure is used only with set 1; sets 2 and 3 have separate\ncoupling parameters for protons and neutron and the amplitudes are calculated independently.\nThe other issue that also has some bearing on the calculated cross sections is the choice of the\ninitial and final momenta of the participating nucleon. We shall make a comparison between two\nchoices. One is the \"frozen nucleon\" approximation in which each nucleon moves as part of the\ntarget but without allowance for the Fermi motion. The second, and possibly more appropriate,\nchoice for the nucleon momenta allows for Fermi motion using an approximate model employed by\nother authors [18, 19, 20]. We use this model in the following form: The initial nucleon momentum\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\np\u03b7 \u2212 p\u03b3 . This choice is the same as the effective momentum\nin the lab frame is taken as: pi = A\u22121\n2A\nused in refs [1, 5, 21]. The momentum of the nucleon in the final state is obtained by applying\nmomentum conservation in the elementary production process.\n\n7\n\n\fCalculations were carried out as outlined in Sec. 2 for incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction cross sections on 12 C, 16 O, and 40 Ca. Qualitatively, our calculations show similar results for all three nuclei.\nCalculations on 16 O and 40 Ca do not produce any significant features beyond what we observe on\n12\nC. We therefore limit our discussion to the latter nucleus. We will present the results of the 12 C\ncalculations, in which we have used the 1p-shell spectroscopic factors of Cohen and Kurath [22].\nWe have selected four excited states of 12 C that are well described by a 1p\u22121\n3/2 \u2212 1p1/2 configuration:\n(2+ 0; 4.44), (2+ 1; 16.11), (1+ 0; 12.71), and (1+ 1; 15.11). It is found that transitions to the T = 1\nstates are much stronger than those to T = 0 states. For this reason we will present a number\nof comparisons below involving calculations for only the (2+ 1; 16.11) state. Additional calculations\ninvolving all of the four states will also be presented.\nWe now discuss the results of our calculations for the\n\n12\n\nC(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11) reaction. We\n\nbegin by looking at the dependence of the cross sections on the choice of nucleon momenta and\nthe sensitivity to the three coupling parameter choices discussed above. Using parameter set 1, we\nshow in Figure 2 a comparison between the two choices of nucleon momenta. The calculations,\ncarried out using the PWA, are presented for the differential cross section in the laboratory frame\nat E\u03b3 = 766 MeV. The frozen nucleon approximation leads to larger cross sections in the forward\ndirection than those for which the Fermi motion is taken into account in the approximate manner\ndiscussed above. The shapes of the two angular distributions are very similar. Of particular interest,\nthough, is that the relative contributions of the S11 and D13 resonances are strongly influenced by\nthe choice of nucleon momenta, even though the total cross sections are reasonably stable. Because\nthe allowance for Fermi motion is the more realistic choice, all subsequent calculations in this paper\nare carried out with this choice.\nIn Figure 3 we compare the cross sections for the other two sets of coupling parameters (sets\n2 and 3, Table 1). The separate contributions of the S11 and D13 are also shown. Note that in\nthe present model the background terms do not contribute to isovector transitions, as the coupling\nparameters used for these terms [2] are the same for protons and neutrons. The cross sections (dotted\ncurve) due to the S11 are the same for both sets since the two sets have identical parameters for this\nresonance. The contributions from the D13 are much smaller, with those from set 2 being almost\ndouble those from set 3. This reflects the small branching ratios extracted by the analysis of Tiator\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\net al. [16]. This effect occurs despite the observation that the couplings f\u03b7N D13 \u03baD13 and f\u03b7N D13 \u03baD13\n\n8\n\n\fare larger for the set 3 parameters than for set 2. We have found that these two parameters give rise\nto amplitudes of opposite sign and that the cancellation is stronger for the set 3 parameters. One\nimportant feature evident in Figure 3 is the strong constructive interference between the S11 and\nD13 contributions in this energy region. Even though the D13 cross section is by itself small, the\ncombined cross section is strongly enhanced (see below for a discussion of the energy dependence of\nthis interference effect). The cross section curves in Figure 3 should also be compared with the thick\nsolid curve in Figure 2 which gives the corresponding result for parameter set 1. We see that the\nlatter cross section falls in between those for sets 2 and 3. This gives a measure of the adequacy of\nthe assumption used together with set 1, namely that the isospin dependence of the total incoherent\namplitude is the same as the S11 amplitude.\nFrom this point on all calculations will use parameter set 3 and allow for Fermi motion. Based\non the comparisons presented above, this choice, in addition to being more realistic, should provide\nconservative estimates of the incoherent cross sections.\nIt is now instructive to look at the energy dependence of the interference between the S11 and\nD13 contributions. For the same state as above we show the results in Figure 4, using parameter\nset 3 and again using plane waves for the outgoing eta particles. We see from the figure that the\ninterference is destructive for energies near the threshold region. At photon energies above about\n675 MeV the interference pattern is constructive and the influence of the D13 is somewhat enhanced.\nCalculations with sets 1 and 2 show similar behavior with slight changes in the energy at which\ntransition from destructive to constructive interference takes place. For all parameter sets the total\ncross sections peak near E\u03b3 = 750 MeV.\nThe cross sections in the above comparisons are calculated in the plane wave approximation in\nwhich the final-state interactions of the \u03b7 mesons with the residual nucleus are neglected. In Figure 5\nwe study the effect of these final-state interactions. The calculations show the energy dependence of\nthe total cross section for the same reaction on 12 C. The two types of optical potentials referred to\nearlier are used to calculate the distorted waves of the \u03b7 mesons. The calculations show that the finalstate interactions are substantial, leading to suppression of the cross sections particularly for photon\nenergies near the peak region. For both distorting potentials we observe a slight shift of the cross\nsection peak towards higher energies. At higher energies, the effects of the two optical potentials\nbegin to diverge. The DW1 potential weakens at these energies whereas the DW3 potential retains\n\n9\n\n\fits strength and hence continues to suppress the cross section at these energies. The figure also\nshows the separate contributions from the S11 and D13 resonances for the DW1 calculations. We\nsee that, as was the case for the PW calculations in Figure 4, the interference between these two\ncontributions changes from destructive near threshold to constructive at higher energies.\nIn Figure 6, we compare the results of our calculations for the differential cross sections of\nthe 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 0; 4.44) and 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11) reactions at E\u03b3 = 650 MeV to the corresponding calculations by Bennhold and Tanabe [5]. Our calculations use optical potential DW1 and\nthe coupling parameters of set 3. Based on the treatment of the bound nucleons, we shall refer to\nour calculations as relativistic and Bennhold and Tanabe's as nonrelativistic. There is good qualitative agreement between the two sets of calculations. The relativistic calculations indicate a larger\ncross section for the isovector transition than the nonrelativistic calculations. The reverse holds for\nthe isoscalar transition. Furthermore, the suppression of the cross sections due to final-state interactions is more significant in the relativistic calculations. We note however that the two approaches\ndiffer in many respects, for example, in the elementary input and the form of the transition matrix\nelements.\nFrom an experimental standpoint, it would be exceedingly difficult to resolve a particular nuclear\nexcited state left in the wake of an incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction reaction. It might be possible,\nhowever, to determine indirectly the excitation energy of the nucleus with sufficient precision to\nexclude coherent and quasifree reactions. To this effect, we have calculated the summed total\nincoherent \u03b7-photoproduction cross section on 12 C for Ex in the range of 4 MeV to 17 MeV by\nincluding all four excited states mentioned at the beginning of this section. We have restricted the\ncalculations to excitation energies where we could treat the single-particle states as bound states.\nFigure 7 shows this total cross section as a function of the energy of the incident photon. The curves\nare DWA calculations using the two optical potentials referred to earlier. This total cross section is\non the order of 100 nb or more for 750 MeV photons, which is about an order of magnitude larger\nthan several theoretical estimates of the coherent cross section[1, 2] and only about two orders of\nmagnitude below the measured inclusive cross section for this target nucleus [6].\n\n10\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have developed a relativistic model for the incoherent photoproduction of \u03b7 mesons.\nThe ingredients of the model are that (i) the nucleon wavefunctions are solutions of the Dirac\nequation with appropriate scalar and vector potentials consistent with the relativistic mean field\napproach, (ii) the \u03b7 meson is described by solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with appropriate\noptical potentials, and (iii) the interactions between the fields are introduced through a covariant\neffective Lagrangian. Contributions from the S11 (1535) and D13 (1520) nucleon resonances, t-channel\nvector mesons, and nucleon Born diagrams are included. The contributions by the latter two\ndiagrams to the incoherent cross sections are very small.\nUnlike coherent photoproduction on isoscalar targets, the S11 nucleon resonance provides the\nlargest contribution to the incoherent cross section. One of the interesting results of the present\nwork however, is the role of the D13 resonance. Although its cross section is evidently smaller\nthan that of the S11 , the D13 has a significant effect on the cross section through its interference\nwith the S11 contribution. We have established that this is independent of the set of coupling\nparameters used. The interference pattern is destructive in the threshold region, but becomes\nconstructive at higher photon energies. The incoherent cross section is found to be much larger\nfor isovector transitions than for isoscalar ones. This is consistent with the results of the nonrelativistic calculations of Bennhold and Tanabe. We find however that the cross sections for the\nT = 1 states are somewhat larger in our calculations, while the opposite is true for the T = 0\ntransitions. Furthermore comparisons show that the suppression of the cross section due to finalstate inteactions is somewhat stronger in the relativistic approach.\nAlthough the cross sections for an incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction reaction to T = 0 excited states\nare quite small, those for T = 1 excited states are found to be relatively large. Our calculations show\nthat the summed total incoherent cross sections to a set of states in 12 C, with excitation energies\nin the range 4 \u2212 17 MeV, are in excess of 100 nb. These are sufficiently large to be potentially\nobservable. Such measurements would be valuable in clarifying the seemingly enhanced role played\nby the D13 in incoherent photoproduction.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to M. Hedayati-Poor, J. I.

The present calculations using parameter\nset 1 are represented by the solid line. The data points are from the ESRF experiment [15].\n\nFigure 2: The incoherent differential cross section, as a function of the laboratory angle \u03b8\u03b7 , for\nthe 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11) reaction at E\u03b3 = 766 MeV. The curves are PWA calculations using\nparameter set 1 according to the prescription explained in the text. The solid, dashed, and dashdotted curves show the total, S11 , and D13 cross sections, respectively. The thin curves represent\ncalculations in the frozen approximation for the struck nucleon kinematics and the thick curves\nshow the results when Fermi motion is taken into account in the approximate manner discussed in\nthe text.\n\nFigure 3: Same reaction as Figure 2 except that the calculations are for parameter sets 2 and 3.\nThe thin solid curve (set 2) and thick solid curve (set 3) are full PWA cross sections. The dotted\ncurve shows the S11 cross sections (identical for both sets). The dot-dashed (dashed) curves show\nthe D13 cross sections for set 2 (set 3).\n\nFigure 4: Total incoherent cross section for the 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11) reaction as a function of\nthe photon energy. The long- (short-) dashed curves show the separate cross sections of the S11\n(D13 ) diagrams. The calculations are carried out using the PWA and parameter set 3.\n\nFigure 5: Total incoherent cross section for the 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11) reaction as a function of\nthe photon energy. The solid curve shows the PWA calculations. The long-dashed (short-dashed)\ncurves are distorted wave calculations using optical potential DW1 (DW3). The dotted (dash-dot)\ncurves show the individual contributions of the S11 (D13 ) resonances.\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 6: Differential cross sections for the 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 0; 4.44) and 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11)\nreactions, denoted by T = 0 and T = 1, respectively, with E\u03b3 = 650 MeV. The upper graph,\nlabeled Relativistic, shows the results of the present calculations using parameter set 3. The lower\ngraph, labeled Nonrelativistic, shows the corresponding calculations by Bennhold and Tanabe [5].\nThe dashed curves indicate PWA calculations and the solid curves denote DWA calculations using\nthe DW1 optical potential.\nFigure 7: Total cross sections for the incoherent \u03b7-photoproduction reaction 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 . Contributions from the 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 0; 4.44), 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (2+ 1; 16.11), 12 C(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (1+ 0; 12.71), and\n12\nC(\u03b3, \u03b7)12 C\u2217 (1+ 1; 15.11) reactions are included.
