The first qualitatively correct\ndescription of the excitation spectrum of weakly interacting bosons was given by Bogoliubov1 using a mean-field\napproximation. The Bogoliubov excitation spectrum exhibits the gapless linear Goldstone mode character at\nsmall wave vectors and approaches the quadratic dispersion of free bosons as wave vectors become large and interaction effects become negligible. The crossover scale\nseparating these two regimes is given by kc = 2mc where\nm is the mass of the bosons and c the velocity of the\nGoldstone modes. In dimension D = 3, this picture has\nrecently been confirmed experimentally using the Bragg\nspectroscopy technique on cold atoms.2\nBeliaev3 went beyond the Bogoliubov approximation\nand calculated the self-energies of the quasiparticles to\nsecond order in the effective interaction, allowing both\nto extract corrections to the quasiparticle dispersion as\nwell as to calculate their lifetime. However, as discussed\nin detail in Ref. [4], perturbative approaches suffer from\ninfrared (IR) divergences for all D \u2264 3 which are difficult to control at second order (in most physical quantities the divergences cancel out) and essentially impossible to control at any higher order of perturbation theory.\nThese divergences have their origin in the U (1) symmetry of the model and can be traced to the divergence of\n\nthe longitudinal correlation function.5\u20139 Nepomnyashchy\nand Nepomnyashchy5 showed rigorously that the IR divergences, together with Ward identities originating from\nthe U (1) symmetry of the model, lead to the surprising\nresult that the anomalous self-energy \u03a3A (k, \u03c9) vanishes\nat zero momentum and frequency. This result cannot\nbe reproduced by finite order perturbation theory, and is\nin sharp contrast with both the Bogoliubov and the Beliaev approach where the anomalous self-energy at zero\nmomentum and zero frequency is finite. Furthermore,\nin the perturbative approaches a finite value of \u03a3A (0) is\na key quantity which controls both the crossover to the\nGoldstone regime as well as the velocity of the Goldstone\nmodes. Nepomnyashchy and Nepomnyashchy showed\nfurther that the correct structure of the self-energies\ncontains non-analytic terms which are dominant in the\nasymptotic limit of small frequencies and momenta. This\nnon-perturbative structure arises for modes with momenta smaller than the generalized Ginzburg scale kG ,\nwhich, for weakly interacting bosons, is much smaller\nthan kc = 2mc. A correct analysis of these non-analytic\nterms allows to recover the Goldstone modes within a\nframework where \u03a3A (0) = 0. There are a number of\napproaches which avoid the IR divergences, the earliest\nis due to Popov who separated the low energy modes\nfrom the high energy modes and treated the low energy\nsector within a hydrodynamic theory for the phase degrees of freedom, which is free of IR divergences.10 Another approach is to artificially break the U (1) symmetry by a small symmetry breaking term which can in\nthe end be removed to yield finite results for all physical observables.11 A natural framework to deal with IR\n\n\f2\ndivergences is the renormalization group (RG). A field\ntheoretical RG analysis of the interacting Bose gas at\nasymptotically small frequencies and momenta has been\ndeveloped in Ref. [6], which recovers the asymptotic behavior of the self-energies and the single particle Green's\nfunctions. This required however a very careful analysis\nof Ward identities.\nIn several recent publications the non-perturbative or\nfunctional renormalization group (FRG) has been applied to the interacting Bose gas.12\u201317 The FRG is based\non an exact flow equation of the generating functional of\nirreducible vertex functions (average effective action).18\nSeveral approaches were based on a derivative expansion\nof the effective action which is sufficient to find a relatively simple description of the asymptotic regime.12,13\nOne advantage of the FRG approach is that the Ward\nidentities associated with the U (1) symmetry are automatically obeyed if the truncation does not violate the\ninvariance of the effective action. Another advantage of\nthe FRG is that it can be employed to study the full momentum and frequency dependence of the self-energies.\nSee Refs. [19\u201321] for FRG calculations of the momentum\ndependent self-energy of classical models. In Ref. [14]\nwe showed how the FRG can be used to calculate the\nspectral density of the interacting Bose gas. This was\nbased on a truncation of the exact FRG flow equation\nwhich respects the Nepomnyashchy relation and recovers the non-analytic structure of the low energy sector.\nMoreover, our FRG approach also describes the full dispersion of the Bogoliubov spectrum as well as the Beliaev\ndamping of the quasiparticles. This is the first approach\nwhich succeeds to describe both the non-perturbative aspects which appear at the very small wavevector scale\nk \u226a kG , as well as the perturbative ones, which are controlled by the larger scale kc = 2mc, within a unified\nframework. Recently Dupuis15,16 developed a similar approach and clarified the role of kG in the flow equations,\nbut did not resolve the Beliaev damping of the quasiparticles.\nHere we present in detail our approach of Ref. [14] and\ninvestigate analytically the different scaling regimes of\nthe flow equations. We further derive the flow equations for interacting Bose systems which treat the irreducible density-density interactions exactly and which\nhas not been published previously. This set of equations,\nwhile difficult to solve, would potentially allow to analyze strongly interacting yet dilute Bose systems, which\ncan now be realized in experiments and whose spectrum\nshows clear deviations from the prediction of the Beliaev\napproach.22\nThis work consists of the following parts: In Sec. II we\ndefine the model and briefly review the structure of the\none-particle Green's functions, i.e. discuss the excitations\nand their damping. We further summarize the structure\nof the self-energies in the non-perturbative regime. In\nSec. III we discuss the FRG approach, introduce our approximation and discuss both the general structure of the\nflow equations as well as the results of a derivative ex-\n\npansion in subsection III A for which we present results\nin D = 2. In Sec. IV we finally discuss the results of a\nnon-self-consistent solution of the flow equations which\nyields the full momentum and frequency dependence of\nthe self-energies and allows to extract the single-particle\nspectral function. Numerical results are shown for D = 2.\nIn Appendix A we briefly review the arguments from\nRef. [5] which lead to \u03a3A (0) = 0. An analysis of the\nderivative expansion is presented in Appendix B, where\nthe flow of the effective interaction is analyzed analytically and the standard T -matrix results from diagrammatic approaches are recovered for general dimension D.\nFurthermore, in Appendix C we show how the Ginzburg\nscale kG emerges from the flow equations. In Appendix D\nwe further show analytically, how the exact results for the\nasymptotic form of the normal and anomalous propagators is obtained from the non-self-consistent approach of\nSec. IV. We conclude our work with a summary in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nSELF-ENERGIES OF THE INTERACTING\nBOSE GAS\n\nWe consider a system of bosons at zero temperature\nwith a repulsive interaction potential u\u039b0 (k). The bare\nmicroscopic action is defined in terms of the following\nfunctional of a complex field \u03c8,\nZ\nS[\u03c8\u0304, \u03c8] = \u2212 \u03c8\u0304K (i\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + \u03bc)\u03c8K\nK\n\n+\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nu\u039b0 (k)\u03c1\u2212K \u03c1K ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nK\n\nwhere K = (k, i\u03c9) and k is a D-dimensional momentum\nvariable with the absolute value k and i\u03c9 a bosonic Matsubara frequency.

This cutoff is related to the finite range\nof the interaction; for example, for hard core interactions\n\u039b0 \u223c 2\u03c0/d, where d is the diameter of the particles. The\nU (1) symmetry of the model Eq.

[4], already at second order the diagrams for the self-energy are in fact IR\ndivergent and the divergent terms have to be separated\nfrom the non-divergent terms in order to obtain physical results. These divergences are in fact related to another problem common to all perturbative approaches,\nwhich is that they violate an exact result obtained by\nNepomnyashchy and Nepomnyashchy,5 who showed that\nthe momentum and frequency independent part of the\nanomalous self-energy vanishes for D \u2264 3,\n\u03a3A (K = 0) = 0 .\n\n(2.22)\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the IR divergences\nand a Ward identity relating the three point vertices\nto the two point vertices, see Appendix A. While in\nthe Bogoliubov and Beliaev approach a finite value of\n\u03a3A (K = 0) ensures the Goldstone character of the long\nwavelength modes, in the exact theory the Goldstone\n\n\f4\nmodes are recovered by a non-analytic structure of the\nself-energies which have at small frequencies and momenta the form5\n\u03a3N (K) \u2248 \u03c10 u(K) + \u03bc + i\u03c9 + aN \u01ebk + bN \u03c9 2 ,(2.23a)\n\u03a3A (K) \u2248 \u03c10 u(K) + aA \u01ebk + bA \u03c9 2 ,\n(2.23b)\nwhere u(K) is a non-analytic function of \u03c9 and k and\nthe coefficients aN , bN , aA , bA depend on the interaction\n(note that the coefficient of the i\u03c9 term is exactly equal\nto unity5 ). Thus, while each of the self-energies is nonanalytic for D \u2264 3, their difference is analytic, so that\nthe quantity\n\u03c3(K) = \u03a3N (K) \u2212 \u03a3A (K) \u2212 \u03bc\n\nGreen's functions.\nThe effective action is the\ngenerating functional of irreducible vertex functions,\ni.e. it generates cutoff-dependent irreducible vertices\n(n,m)\n(K1\u2032 , . . . , Kn\u2032 ; Km , . . . , K1 ) which in the condensed\n\u0393\u039b\nphase are defined via the functional Taylor expansion of\nthe corresponding generating functional in powers of the\nfluctuations \u03b4\u03c6K = \u03c6K \u2212 \u03b4K,0 \u03c60\u039b ,34\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n\u0393\u039b [\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6] =\nn!m!\nn,m=0\n\n\u2032 K\nKn\nm\n\nK1\u2032\n\n***\n\nZ\n\nK1\n\n(n,m)\n\n(K1\u2032 , . . . , Kn\u2032 ; Km , . . . , K1 )\n\u00d7 \u0393\u039b\n(3.3)\n\u00d7 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0304K1\u2032 . . . \u03b4 \u03c6\u0304Kn\u2032 \u03b4\u03c6Km . . . \u03b4\u03c6K1 .\n\n(2.24)\n\n(2.25)\n\nWe will use in our FRG approach below a scheme\nwhere this structure of the self-energies appears naturally.

FUNCTIONAL RENORMALIZATION\nGROUP APPROACH TO THE INTERACTING\nBOSE GAS\n\nWe shall now set up the FRG equations for the interacting Bose gas. For recent reviews of the FRG method\nsee Refs. [27\u201333]. The basic idea is simple and consists of\nintroducing an IR cutoff \u039b to regulate the theory which\nis then sent to zero in infinitesimally small steps. The\nFRG follows the evolution of the various vertex functions as the IR cutoff \u039b is lowered and yields the true\nvertex functions for \u039b \u2192 0. This will allow us to extract\nthe excitation spectrum and the damping of quasiparticles from the renormalized self-energies within a theory\nwhich is free of IR divergences.\nThe IR divergences which plague the perturbative\napproaches3,4 are removed if we regulate the theory by\nintroducing a momentum cutoff \u039b in the free propagator,\n(3.1)\n\nHere, R\u039b (k) is a regulator function which removes the\nIR divergences arising from modes with k < \u039b and will\nbe specified later. The FRG approach is based on the\ncutoff-dependent effective action which is defined by\nZ\n\u0393\u039b [\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6] = L\u039b [\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6] \u2212 \u03c6\u0304K G\u22121\n(3.2)\n0,\u039b (K)\u03c6K ,\nK\n\nwhere L\u039b [\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6] is the cutoff-dependent Legendre\ntransform of the generating functional of connected\n\nK\n\n(3.4)\nwhere\n\u03b4\u03c1K =\n\nG\u22121\n0,\u039b (K) = i\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + \u03bc \u2212 R\u039b (k) .\n\n***\n\nZ Z\n\n\u00d7 \u03b4K1\u2032 +...+Kn\u2032 ,Km +...+K1\n\nhas the expansion\n\u03c3(K) \u2248 i\u03c9 + (aN \u2212 aA )\u01ebk + (bN \u2212 bA )\u03c9 2 .\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u0304Q \u03c6Q+K \u2212 \u03b4K,0 \u03c10\u039b\n\n(3.5)\n\nQ\n\nis the Fourier-transform of the condensate density fluctuation \u03c1(X) \u2212 \u03c10\u039b = \u03c6\u0304X \u03c6X \u2212 \u03c10\u039b . Here, in analogy with\nthe definition of K, we use X = (r, \u03c4 ), where r is a Ddimensional real space coordinate and \u03c4 is the imaginary\ntime. At the initial UV cutoff scale \u039b = \u039b0 Eq. (3.4)\nis exact and u\u039b0 (K) is just the bare interaction which\nenters Eq. (2.1) whereas \u03c3\u039b vanishes initially,\n\u03c3\u039b0 (K) = 0 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nWhile the effective action (3.4) describes arbitrarily\nstrong density-density interactions, processes which involve three or more particles are neglected. Thus, the\nansatz is not expected to be accurate for dense systems\nbut it can describe dilute yet strongly interacting ones.\nNote that the effective action is completely parameterized\nin terms of the scalar \u03c10\u039b and the two cutoff-dependent\nscalar functions \u03c3\u039b (K) and u\u039b (K). Eq. (3.4) represents\na non-local potential approximation of the action and is\nexplicitly U (1) invariant for any value of \u039b even if the\ncondensate density \u03c10\u039b is finite. In the usual field expansion, the U (1) symmetry of the model leads to Ward\nidentities which relate higher order irreducible vertices\nto lower ones. In our approach the irreducible vertices\nare derived from an explicitly invariant effective action\n\n\f5\nwhich guarantees that all Ward identities are automatically obeyed.

Moreover, since \u03c3\u039b (0) vanishes, Eqs. (3.9a,3.9b) obey the Hugenholtz-Pines relation (2.12) for all \u039b. Note that Eq.

While similar flow equations were recently solved exactly for a model of classical crystalline\n\n.+\n\nx\n\nwhich, together with Eqs. (3.9a,3.9b), yield the flow\nequations for \u03c3\u039b (K) and u\u039b (K). We stress that up\nto this point the only approximation we have made is\nthat we only kept those irreducible correlations which\nare explicitly stated in the Eq. (3.4) for \u0393\u039b [\u03c6\u0304, \u03c6], i.e.\nwe only consider two-body density-density correlations.\nHowever, these can be arbitrarily strong and the set\nof Eqs. (3.20,3.23a,3.23b) allow to calculate \u03c10\u039b , u\u039b (K),\nand \u03c3\u039b (K), which completely determine all vertices of\nEq. (3.4), without any further approximation. In this\nrespect, our approach goes beyond the set of equations\ngiven in Appendix C of Ref. [16] where additional approximations were made. While of similar complexity,\nthe equations derived by Dupuis16 do not treat the full\nfrequency- and momentum-dependence of the three- and\nfour-point vertices, which appear in the flow of the selfenergies, exactly. In some diagrams the dependence of\nthese vertices on the internal frequency and momentum\nis neglected.\n\n(3.23b)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Diagrammatic representation of the\nexact FRG flow equation for the condensate density. The\ncircles with two external legs on the left-hand side denote\nthe normal and anomalous self-energy. The circles with three\nexternal legs on the right-hand side denote irreducible three\npoint vertices. Crossed circles with a dot denote the derivative of the order parameter with respect to the RG cutoff \u039b,\nand crossed solid arrows represent normal or anomalous single\nscale propagators as defined in Eq.

In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 we\nshow for D = 2 the flows for the coupling parameters and\ny\nz\nfor the dynamical exponent z\u039b = 2 \u2212 \u03b7\u039b\n\u2212 \u03b7\u039b\nwhich illustrates the crossover from the free particle regime with\nz\u039b = 2 to the Goldstone regime, where z\u039b = 1. As\npointed out by Dupuis in Refs. [15,16], the crossover of\nz\u039b is governed by the generalized Ginzburg scale kG ,\nwhich is indicated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 and is extracted\nfrom the flow equations in Appendix C. Also indicated\nis the crossover scale kc = 2mc. Evidently, kG is the relevant scale controlling the flow of the dynamical exponent\nz\u039b .15,16 On the other hand, the scale which determines\nthe crossover from a linear to a quadratic behavior in the\nfull quasiparticle dispersion is not kG but the crossover\nscale kc , as is expected from standard perturbative approaches and as we will show in the next section when\nwe calculate the full frequency and momentum dependence of the self-energies. It is perhaps surprising that\nthe crossover in the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle dispersion happens at a completely different scale\nas the crossover in the \u039b-dependence of the parameters\nentering the derivative expansion. In the weak-coupling\nregime this is however easily understood, since a quasiparticle with momentum k in the range kG \u226a k \u226a kc\nfeels the largely unrenormalized bare value u\u039b0 of the\ninteraction potential which is sufficient to render its dispersion linear, whereas the flow of the parameters entering the derivative expansion are sensitive only to the\n\n0\n\nu\u039b /u\u039b\n\nz\nNote that at T = 0, the scaling dimension \u03b7\u039b\nplays no\nimportant role since it vanishes at \u039b = 0. However, at the\nfinite temperature transition of the Bose gas the critical\nz\nfluctuations lead to a finite \u03b7 z = lim\u039b\u21920 \u03b7\u039b\n. This was\nanalyzed in Ref. [17] where the anomalous dimension \u03b7 z\nwas evaluated at the critical point. The relevant scaling\ny\ndimension at T = 0 is however \u03b7\u039b\nwhich controls also the\ncrossover from the z\u039b = 2 regime to the z\u039b = 1 regime\nwhich is characteristic of the Goldstone modes.12,13\nEquations similar to Eqs. (3.35a, 3.35b, 3.39a-3.39c)\nwere already discussed in Refs. [12\u201317] and we briefly\nsummarize the results for 2 \u2264 D \u2264 3. At T = 0 the condensate density \u03c10\u039b flows to some finite limit \u03c10\u039b\u21920 = \u03c10 >\n0, while the coupling constant u\u039b vanishes for \u039b \u2192 0\nA\nwhich ensures \u03a3N\n\u039b\u21920 (K = 0) = \u03bc and \u03a3\u039b\u21920 (K = 0) = 0,\nin accordance with both the Hugenholtz-Pines relation24\nand the Nepomnyashchy identity.5 Furthermore, Y\u039b vanishes for \u039b \u2192 0, again in accordance with exact results.5\nSince V\u039b and Z\u039b are finite for \u039b \u2192 0, the low energy modes are phonons with a linear dispersion and\nvelocity12\u201316\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0.0\n\n0 ln(\u039b0/kc)\n\n2 ln(\u039b0/kG) 4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0 ln(\u039b0/kc)\n\n2 ln(\u039b0/kG) 4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nln(\u039b0/\u039b)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n(3.45a)\n(3.45b)\n\n\u03c10\u039b /\u03c10\u039b\n\n\u01690 = 2mu\u039b0 \u039b0D\u22122 ,\n\u03bc\u0303 = 2m\u03bc\u039b0 \u039b\u22122\n0 .\n\n1.0\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\nln(\u039b0/\u039b)\n\nFIG. 4: Typical RG flows of the interaction parameter u\u039b\nand the condensate density \u03c10\u039b for D = 2.

As pointed out in Sec. III, a\ncompletely self-consistent solution of the flow equations\n(3.20, 3.23a, 3.23b) is numerically extremely difficult and\nwe therefore use an approximation in which we treat\nonly the coupling parameters of the derivative expan-\n\n\f10\n1.2\n\nV\u039b /V\nZ\u039b\n\nZ\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\nY\u039b\n0 ln(\u039b0/kc)\n2.0\n\n2 ln(\u039b0/kG)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nln(\u039b0/\u039b)\n\nz\u039b=2-\u03b7z\u039b-\u03b7y\u039b\n\nA(k, \u03c9) = \u22122ImGN (k, i\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + i0).\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\ny\n\n\u03b7\u039b\n0.5\nz\n\n\u03b7\u039b\n0 ln(\u039b0/kc)\n\ncause of the structural similarity of both the diagrams\nand the propagators in this approximation to the Beliaev theory, we expect to reproduce qualitatively Beliaev's\nperturbative results for both the spectrum and the damping, bar their divergences. However, since already the\nderivative expansion contains the key information about\nthe non-analytic structure of the self-energies, our approach also captures these, as discussed in more detail in\nAppendix D.\nAll information about the quasiparticle properties is\nencoded in the single-particle spectral density which is\nrelated to the imaginary part of the real-frequency normal Green's function,\n\n2 ln(\u039b0/kG)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nln(\u039b0/\u039b)\n\nFIG. 5: Typical RG flows of the coupling parameters Y\u039b ,\nZ\u039b , V\u039b and the dynamical exponent z\u039b and both anomalous\ny\nz\ndimensions \u03b7\u039b\nand \u03b7\u039b\nin D = 2. The initial values are the\nsame as in Fig. 4.\n\nsion of Sec. III A self-consistently, while all higher powers\nof frequency and momentum are determined in a nonself-consistent manner. A similar truncation has previously been tested for the symmetry-broken phase of a \u03c64\ntheory.21 A non-self-consistent solution can be quite simply achieved, starting from the approximate flow equations given in Eqs. (3.26a, 3.26b). On the right hand\nside of these equations we use the approximate form of\nthe propagators given in Eqs. (3.28a, 3.28b) which are\nbased on the derivative expansion, see Eq. (3.24) and\nEq. (3.27). The same approximation is employed for the\nsingle scale propagators. Note that Eqs. (3.28a, 3.28b)\nhave a sensible large K behavior which for any finite\n\u039b and all k > \u039b are similar to the standard first order result of the Bogoliubov approximation but with a\nrenormalized interaction parameter u\u039b , a renormalized\ncondensate density \u03c10\u039b , a mass renormalization expressed\nby Z\u039b and further a renormalized frequency dependence\nas expressed through Y\u039b and V\u039b .\nUsing again the Litim regulator (3.31), the flows of\nthe coupling parameters u\u039b , \u03c1\u039b , V\u039b , Z\u039b and Y\u039b can be\nsimply obtained from the solutions of Eqs. (3.35a, 3.35b,\n3.39a-3.39c). With these approximations, all parameters\nentering the right hand side of Eqs. (3.26a, 3.26b) are\ncompletely determined. For any K, we can thus simply\nperform the integration over \u039b. With appropriate boundary conditions this yields both \u03a3N (K) and \u03a3A (K). Be-\n\n(4.1)\n\nIts calculation requires an analytical continuation to real\nfrequencies. Here we apply the standard Pad\u00e9 approximant technique38 which has the advantage that it can\nbe easily implemented numerically. Although it has been\noriginally proposed for dealing with systems at finite temperatures, it can also be used for zero-temperature calculation if the input functions are sufficiently well resolved.\nIf it does converge, the technique is furthermore quite\naccurate. Applied to our problem it proved to be very\nrobust and the results for the spectral density quickly\nconverged for momenta which are not too small. For\nthe actual data used to calculate the spectral density we\nused 450 Matsubara frequency data points for each momentum k. Even though the damping is quite small, this\nallowed to accurately extract the width of the resonance\nand the damping.\nThe first task is to calculate the Matsubara normal\nGreen's function with satisfactory resolution. A typical\nresult for the normal Matsubara Green's function calculated within the non-self-consistent FRG scheme just\ndescribed is shown in Fig. 6. The initial conditions for\nthe condensate and interaction were chosen in such a way\nthat the ratio kc /kG remains sufficiently large (see legend below Fig. 9). We further kept the ratio c/c0 close\nto unity to ensure that we are still in the weakly interacting regime. For very small momenta (we analyzed\nmomenta down to k = 0.045kG for kc /kG \u2248 45), the\nreal part of the normal Matsubara Green's function indicates a resonance at \u03c9 = ck; however for such small k\nthe analytic continuation no longer converged. We never\nfound any trace of the Ginzburg scale kG in the properties of the normal Green's function, which, at least in the\nweakly interacting regime, is perhaps expected since in\nthe asymptotic regime the non-analytic terms are known\nto cancel out in the normal Green's functions, see the\ndiscussion in Appendix D.\nIn order to check convergence of the Pad\u00e9 approach\nwe calculated Matsubara Green's functions for up to 450\nnon-equidistant frequencies in the range 0 < \u03c9 < 160ck\nfor each k and investigated the stability of the results on\nincreasing the number of Pad\u00e9 polynomials. For example, for kG \u2248 0.2kc and k > 0.1kc we obtain excellent\nconvergence and a spectral density which obeys the cor-\n\n\f11\n0\n\n300\n\nEk/Ek\n\nc\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nA(k,\u03c9) ck\n\nRe GN(k,i\u03c9) ck\n\n-10\n-20\n-30\n\n0.2\n\n200\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\nkG/kc\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nk/kc\n\n100\n-40\n-50\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c9/ck\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c9/ck\n\n0\n\nc\n\n\u03b3k/Ek\n\nIm GN(k,i\u03c9) ck\n\n0.08\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.6\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n00\n\n4\n\n\u03c9/ck\n\nrect normalization\nd\u03c9\nA(k, \u03c9) = 1\n2\u03c0\n\nkG/kc\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nk/kc\n\nFIG. 6: Real and imaginary parts of the normal Matsubara\nGreen's function as a function of \u03c9, calculated within the nonself-consistent FRG approach.

The convergence properties of the Pad\u00e9\napproximation become continuously worse on lowering k\nand we could not get a satisfactory analytic continuation\nin the non-perturbative regime k \u226a kG . However, this\nmay be simply due to the narrowing of the peak width\nfor small momenta. For all momenta where we do get a\nstable analytical continuation we find a damping which\nagrees qualitatively with the expected Beliaev damping,\neven for larger interaction strengths.\nA typical shape of the spectral density function obtained from the Pad\u00e9 approximation is shown in Fig. 7\nfor positive \u03c9. One clearly observes a finite peak broadening which can be ascribed to Beliaev damping.3 The extracted spectrum of elementary excitations is p\nalways well\nfitted by a Bogoliubov-like expression Ek = \u01eb2k + c2 k 2\nand the damping of quasiparticles always reveals a k 3\nbehavior for k \u2192 0, in accordance with the predictions\nof the perturbative analysis, compare Eq. (2.19). However, the prefactor \u03b10 introduced in Eq. (2.19) should be\n\nreplaced by a function \u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 ) of the relevant dimensionless parameters \u03bc\u03030 and \u01690 of the model (2.1),\n(D=2)\n\n\u03b3k\n\n\u2248 \u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 )k 3 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nFor small values of both dimensionless parameters \u03bc\u03030\nand \u01690 our results for the damping are very close to\nthe perturbative result Eq. (2.18). For instance, for\n\u03bc\u03030 = 0.008 and \u01690 = 0.8 we obtain c/c0 \u2248 1.0054 and\n\u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 )/\u03b10 \u2248 0.967. As both parameters increase (at\nfixed UV-cutoff \u039b0 ), we find a stronger renormalization\nof both the velocity c of the Goldstone mode and of\n\u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 ). For instance, for \u03bc\u03030 = 0.4 and \u01690 = 4 we\nobtain c/c0 \u2248 1.01 and \u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 )/\u03b10 \u2248 0.915, while the\nresults for \u03bc\u03030 = 0.15 and \u01690 = 15 are c/c0 \u2248 0.669 and\n\u03b1(\u03bc\u03030 , \u01690 )/\u03b10 \u2248 0.526. The first examples correspond to\nthe weakly interacting regime, where many-body renormalizations are expected not to play an important role,\nwhile the last choice of the initial conditions corresponds\n\n\f12\nto a more strongly interacting Bose gas where deviations\nfrom standard perturbation theory are already noticeable.\n\nV.\n\nsolution of these flow equations, or an improved approximative solution, is nonetheless expected to give valuable\ninsights to strongly coupled bosons.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown how the FRG formalism\ncan be applied to calculate the single-particle spectral\ndensity of interacting bosons in dimensions D \u2264 3. We\nhere concentrated on the zero-temperature limit, but it is\nstraightforward to extend the analysis also to finite temperatures and even to the critical temperature.17 The\nFRG seems to be the only presently available analytical\ntechnique which is capable of bridging the gap from the\nnon-perturbative regime at very small frequencies and\nmomenta, where the self-energies become non-analytic,\nand the intermediate to large momentum regime which\nis well described by the standard Beliaev theory.3 In addition to satisfying all symmetry constraints, our approach\nrespects the Nepomnyashchy relation for the anomalous\nself-energy5 and yields the correct asymptotic structure\nof the Green's function as first derived by Gavoret and\nNozi\u00e8res.37 Moreover, our approach not only reproduces\nthe non-analytic behavior of the self-energies for scales\nsmaller than the generalized Ginzburg scale kG , but it\nalso yields the standard results for the T -matrix renormalization in D = 2 and D = 3 at momentum scales\nlarger than kc = 2mc, see Appendix B. Our approach\ntherefore provides a single unified framework to describe\nthe crossover from the long-wavelength Goldstone mode\nregime to the quasi-free boson regime where the energy\ndispersion is quadratic. The correct momentum dependence of the Beliaev damping, including its prefactor, can\nbe extracted from the numerical analysis of the our truncated FRG flow equations. While we presented numerical results for the single-particle spectral density only for\nD = 2, it is straightforward to apply the technique also\nin three dimensions.\nThe explicit results for the spectral function presented in this work were obtained within a non-selfconsistent solution of the truncated FRG flow equations\n(3.26a,3.26b) for the self-energies. Although the derivative expansion has served as a guide for the derivation\nof Eqs. (3.26a,3.26b), our truncation scheme transcends\nthe derivative expansion because on the right-hand side\nof our truncated FRG flow equations all powers of momenta and frequencies are retained. See Ref. [21] for a\nsimilar truncation strategy in the symmetry broken phase\nof classical \u03c64 -theory.\nClearly, our truncation strategy will eventually fail at\nstrong coupling. However, in principle the FRG approach, which is a non-perturbative RG technique, is well\npositioned also for the strong coupling regime. In fact,\nour truncated FRG flow equations (3.20,3.23a,3.23b)\ntakes a two-body density-density interaction of arbitrary\nstrength into account, but neglects all higher order (irreducible) correlations involving three or more particles.

Gavoret and Nozi\u00e8res\nfurther assumed that \u03a3A (0) 6= 0, which contradicts the\nNepomnyashchy relation.5 Eq. (A1) was later rederived\nin a formalism which is free of IR divergences and is consistent with \u03a3A (0) = 0, see Ref. [5]. We sketch here\nbriefly the arguments which lead to the result \u03a3A (0) = 0.\nThe anomalous self-energy can be represented as a\nsum of one-particle irreducible skeleton diagrams, some\nof which are regular and some IR divergent,\n\u2212K\n\nQ\n\n\u2212K\n\n1,2\n\nQ\n\n\u03a3 (K) =\nA\nsing\n\n0,3\n\nK\u2212Q\n\n+\nQ\u2212K\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nK\n\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nQ\u2212K\nK\n\nFIG. 8: Diagrams giving rise to the IR-divergent contribution (A2) to the anomalous self-energy.

These diagrams\nare regular for K \u2192 0 and D > 1. The second term in\n\n\u03a3A\nsing (K)\n\nEq. (A2) is IR divergent and arises from the diagrams\nshown in Fig. 8 which have the analytic form\n\no\np Z n\n= 2u\u039b0 \u03c10\n\u0393(1,2) (Q, K, Q \u2212 K)GN (Q)GN (Q \u2212 K) + \u0393(0,3) (Q \u2212 K; Q, \u2212K)GN (Q)GA (K \u2212 Q) ,\nQ\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere \u0393(1,2) and \u0393(0,3) are the exact irreducible vertices\nwith two in- and one outgoing, and p\nwith three ingoing\nlegs, respectively. The first factor u\u039b0 \u03c10 in Eq. (A3) is\n(1,2)\nthe value of the bare vertex \u0393\u039b0 . In the limit K = 0 and\nfor small internal momenta Q we employ the asymptotic\nformulas (A1) and obtain\nh\ni\n\u03a3A (0) = \u0393(1,2) (0, 0, 0) \u2212 \u0393(0,3) (0, 0, 0)\n\u00d7 KD\n\nZ\u039b0\n0\n\ndq q D\u22121\n\nZ\n\np\nd\u03c9 2u\u039b0 \u03c10\n, (A4)\n2\u03c0 (\u03c9 2 + c2 q 2 )2\n\nwhere the upper limit of the integration over momenta q\nis irrelevant since we are only interested in the IR behavior of the integral. The expression in the brackets on the\nright-hand side of equation (A4) can be further simplified\nby using the Ward identity5\n\nof u\u039b for \u039b \u2192 0 in the initial z = 2 regime is logarithmic in \u039b/\u039b0 , which reflects the vanishing of the s-wave\nscattering length.40 In the z = 2 regime, it suffices to\ninvestigate the flow of the interaction, while setting all\nremaining coupling parameters of the derivative expansion to their initial values. Performing the integration\nover frequencies we obtain from Eq. (3.35b)\n\u039bD+1 KD \u01eb3\u039b \u2212 5\u01eb2\u039b \u2206\u039b + \u01eb\u039b \u22062\u039b + 3\u22063\u039b\n,(B1)\n2mD\nE\u039b5\np\nwhere E\u039b = \u01eb\u039b (\u01eb\u039b + 2\u2206\u039b ) and \u2206\u039b = \u03c10\u039b u\u039b . In the\nz = 2 regime, the Bogoliubov spectrum approaches the\nfree particle dispersion, i. e. \u01eb\u039b \u226b \u2206\u039b . In this case we\nmay simplify Eq.

(A4), yields\nan exact self-consistent equation for the anomalous selfenergy. Since the integral on the right-hand side of equation (A4) diverges for D \u2264 3, the only finite solution of\nthis equation is\n\u03a3A (0) = 0.\n\n(A6)\n\nAppendix B: Analytic approach to the z = 2 regime\nof the derivative expansion\n\nHere we want to investigate the flow of the interaction\nconstant u\u039b in the regime where z\u039b = 2, i.e. the initial part of the renormalization group flow. This regime\nyields results which are analogous to the renormalization\nof the T -matrix in both D = 2 and D = 3. The twodimensional situation is especially interesting since the\nscattering length vanishes in D = 2. We work out below\nthe relevant scale which replaces the scattering length\nand recover the results first discussed by Schick39 who\ninvestigated the hard-core Bose gas in two dimensions\nusing diagrammatic techniques.

However, this can be accounted for by re-adjusting the UVcutoff to \u039b0 = 3\u03c0/8a. According to Eq. (B3), the s-wave\nscattering length is finite in all dimensions above two.\nIn D = 2, the solution of Eq.

(3.35a, 3.35b, 3.39a-3.39c), and derive from them\nthe Ginzburg scale kG which is characteristic for this\nregime. This regime differs from the one discussed in Appendix B in that now the dynamical exponent is z\u039b = 1.\nThe non-perturbative character of the Bose gas is manifest in this regime.\nFor \u039b \u2192 0 we may replace all coupling parameters\nwhich remain finite in this limit by their fixed point values, i.e. Z\u039b \u2248 Z, V\u039b \u2248 V , \u03c10\u039b \u2248 \u03c10 . We may further\nz\nz\napproximate \u03b7\u039b\n\u2248 0 since \u03b7\u039b\nplays no important role\nat T = 0.

Here, we introduced the scale \u039bc and\nu\u039bc = uc . The scale \u039bc is the characteristic scale for the\nboundary of the perturbative z = 2 regime and can be\napproximated as \u039bc \u2248 kc . At this scale, u\u039b has already\nbeen renormalized by the RG flow through the perturbative z = 2 regime, loosely defined by \u039bc . \u039b . \u039b0 .\nThis in general can lead to a substantial suppression of\nuc from its bare value u\u039b0 . However, for weak coupling,\nfor an order of magnitude estimate it is sufficient to assume uc \u2248 u\u039b0 . In any event, the flow of the interaction\nfor \u039b \u226a \u039bc in D < 3 neither depends on the chosen\ninitial interaction uc , nor on the starting value for the\ncutoff-parameter \u039bc , but only on the fully renormalized\nquantities entering the momentum kc and the factor A\u2032D .\nFor \u01eb > 0, i. e. for D < 3, the asymptotic expression for\nu\u039b is in this limit given by\nu\u039b\u21920 \u223c\n\n\u01ebA\u2032D \u01eb\n\u039b .\nmkc\n\n(C6)\n\nFor D < 3 the crossover from the z = 2 to the z = 1\nregime is governed by the generalized Ginzburg scale kG ,\n\n\f15\nwhere \u039bc \u2248 kc .

III A, the coupling function u\u039b (K)\nis expected to become non-analytic for \u039b \u2192 0 and this\ncan be understood already partially from the scaling dimensions of \u03b1\u039b and \u03b2\u039b ,\n[\u03b1\u039b ] = 2 \u2212 D \u2212 z\u039b ,\n[\u03b2\u039b ] = 4 \u2212 D \u2212 3z\u039b .\n\n(D2a)\n(D2b)\n\nIn the Goldstone regime we have z\u039b = 1 which for D = 2\nyields [\u03b1\u039b ] = [\u03b2\u039b ] = \u22121, indicating that both \u03b1\u039b and\n\u03b2\u039b diverge as \u039b\u22121 for small \u039b. This suggests that for\nsmall K the leading order behavior of u\u039b\u21920 (K) should\nbe\n\u221a proportional to k or |\u03c9|, which is consistent with a\n\u03c9 2 + c2 k 2 behavior which we find from the full frequency and momentum dependent calculation. In D = 3,\nthe dimensional analysis predicts [\u03b1\u039b ] = [\u03b2\u039b ] = \u22122. This\nis suggestive of a logarithmic dependence on |\u03c9| and k\nwhich is indeed correct.\nThe flow equations for \u03b1\u039b and \u03b2\u039b can be obtained from\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u03b1\n\u2202\nm\nA\n\u2202\u039b \u03b1\u039b = \u2212 0\u039b \u2202\u039b \u03c10\u039b + 0 \u2202\u039b\n, (D3a)\n\u03a3\n(k,\n0)\n\u03c1\u039b\n\u03c1\u039b\n\u2202k 2 \u039b\nk=0\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u03b2\n\u2202\n1\nA\n\u2202\u039b \u03b2\u039b = \u2212 0\u039b \u2202\u039b \u03c10\u039b + 0 \u2202\u039b\n,(D3b)\n\u03a3\n(0,\n\u03c9)\n\u03c1\u039b\n2\u03c1\u039b\n\u2202\u03c9 2 \u039b\n\u03c9=0\n\n\f16\n4\n\nWe are now in the position to recover the low-energy\nbehavior of the Green's functions.

IV. The initial\nconditions of \u03b1\u039b and \u03b2\u039b are \u03b1\u039b0 = 0 and \u03b2\u039b0 = 0.\nThe analytic expression for the flows is rather lengthy\nand can be found in Ref. [42]. The flow of the parameters\n\u03b1\u039b and \u03b2\u039b for D = 2 is shown in Fig. 10. The divergence\nof both parameters can be understood by keeping only\nthe leading order terms of their flow equations in the limit\n\u039b \u2192 0. In this case, both flow equations reduce to\n\u2202\u039b \u03b1\u039b \u221d \u2202\u039b \u03b2\u039b \u221d u2\u039b \u039bD\u22126 .\n\n(D4)\n\nFor D < 3 we have from Eq. (C6) u\u039b \u221d \u039b3\u2212D and thus\nthe solution of Eqs. (D4) has the following small \u039b behavior,\n\u03b1\u039b \u221d \u03b2\u039b \u221d \u039b1\u2212D ,\n\n(D5)\n\nwhich agrees with the dimensional estimate for z\u039b = 1.\nIn D = 3, the small \u039b behavior u\u039b is proportional to\nln(\u039b/\u039b0 ) [see Eq. (C9)], so that for small \u039b Eq. (D4)\nleads to\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03b1\u039b \u221d \u03b2\u039b \u221d d\u039b\u2032 \u2032 3 2\n\u221d 2\n,\n\u2032\n\u039b\nln(\u039b\n(\u039b ) ln (\u039b0 /\u039b )\n0 /\u039b)\n\u039b\n\n(D6)\nwhere we have kept only the leading term. The upper\nintegration boundary\n\u221a is not relevant for this estimate.\nHence, using \u039b \u223c \u03c9 2 + c2 k 2 , we obtain the analytical\nbehavior of the physical anomalous self-energy in the lowenergy limit in 1 < D < 3,\n\u03a3A (K) \u221d (\u03c9 2 + c2 k 2 )\u01eb/2 .\nIn D = 3, the leading behavior of the anomalous selfenergy is logarithmic,\n\u03a3A (K) \u221d\n\nln\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u0013.\nc\u039b0\n\u221a\n\u03c9 2 + c2 k 2\n\nD\u039b (K) = Y\u039b2 \u03c9 2 + (\u01ebk /Z\u039b + R\u039b (k) + V\u039b \u03c9 2 )\n\u00d7 [(Z\u039b\u22121 + 2\u03c10\u039b \u03b1\u039b )\u01ebk + R\u039b (k)\n+(V\u039b + 2\u03c10\u039b \u03b2\u039b )\u03c9 2 ].\n\n(D9)\n\nThe divergence of the parameters \u03b1\u039b and \u03b2\u039b enables\nus to expand Eqs. (D7, D8) in powers of the small quantity \u03b1\u22121\n\u039b under the assumption \u03b2\u039b /\u03b1\u039b \u2192 const. For\nmomenta k . \u039b, we obtain to leading order of the expansion,\n\nGN (K) = \u2212GA (K) =\n\n[\u03c9 2\n\n2V\n1\nm\u03c10 c2\n,\n=\n\u03c1 \u03c9 2 + c2 k 2\n\n1\n+ (2mZV )\u22121 k 2 ]\n(D10)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03c10 /Z, and the velocity of the Goldstone mode\nis\n1\nc= \u221a\n,\n2mV Z\n\n(D11)\n\nsee Eq. (3.46). Eq. (D10) is exactly the Gavoret and\nNozi\u00e8res result37 given in Eq. (A1). We conclude that our\nnon-self-consistent approach from Sec. IV both correctly\ndescribes the non-analytic behavior of the self-energies\nand yields the correct asymptotic behavior of the propagators. Note also that in the asymptotic result (D10)\nthe scale kG and all of the non-analytic behavior of the\nself-energies is completely absent and it remains an open\nproblem whether and how the non-perturbative scale kG\nshows up in the spectrum or damping of quasiparticles.\nThe scale does however emerge quite dramatically in the\nso-called longitudinal Green's function which is defined\nand discussed e.g. in Refs. [6,15,16]. While for usual\nBose systems the longitudinal Green's function is not accessible to experiments, in antiferromagnetic materials,\nsubject to strong magnetic fields close to the saturation\nfield strength, it is possible to directly probe the spectral\nproperties of the longitudinal Green's function,41 which\nis related to the longitudinal spin structure factor of the\nunderlying spin model.\n\n\f17\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n\n18\n19\n\n20\n\nN.
