Growth of the monolayer proceeds via self-assembly of an interconnected network of pentagonal\nPb stars, which are shown to be \u03c4 -inflated compared to similar structural elements of the quasiperiodic substrate. Measurements of the electronic structure of the system using scanning tunnelling\nspectroscopy and ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy reveal that the Pb monolayer displays a\npseudo-gap at the Fermi level which is directly related to its quasiperiodic structure.\n\nQuasicrystals are complex intermetallic alloys with\nlong-range aperiodic order and non-crystallographic rotational symmetry1 . The physical properties arising\nfrom the quasiperiodic arrangement of metal atoms in\nquasicrystals significantly depart from those of periodic\nalloys2 . The most surprising feature is perhaps the fact\nthat although quasicrystals are alloys of metallic elements, they behave as poorly metallic systems. A decrease of the spectral intensity at the Fermi level corresponding to the presence of a pseudo-gap3 in the density\nof states (DOS) is found in bulk electronic measurements\nof quasicrystals. The pseudogap arises because of the\nFermi surface - Brillouin zone interaction and it has been\nshown that the transport properties are dependent on the\ndepth of the gap4 . Consequently, there is considerable interest in clarifying the relative importance of quasiperiodic order and the complex chemistry of quasicrystals in\ndetermining the width and depth of the pseudogap.\nThe issue would be considerably simplified if there were\nsingle element quasicrystals. As such materials do not exist in bulk form, there have been several recent attempts\nto grow single element quasiperiodic systems using quasicrystalline surfaces as templates. A number of elements\nwith differing chemistry have been utilised in an attempt\nto achieve this goal. On both Al-Pd-Mn5 and Al-Ni-\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: e-mail: Ledieu@lsg2m.org\naddress: Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto,\nToronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada\n\u2020 Present\n\nCo6 , Si atoms have been found to occupy unique sites at\nsub-monolayer coverages, leading to ordered adsorption;\nhowever at coverages > 0.33 monolayers (ML), the structures became increasingly disordered due to occupation\nof a range of other adsorption sites. Aluminum atoms\nwere found to order into pentagonal \"starfish\" on the fivefold surface of Al-Cu-Fe at low submonolayer coverages,\nthough this initial ordering did not lead to the formation of ordered monolayers7 . Franke et al. first demonstrated quasiperiodicity in Bi and Sb monolayers on AlPd-Mn and Al-Ni-Co quasicrystal surfaces8 . These measurements were done using diffraction techniques, which\ndo not yield information on how such layers assemble.\nMoreover no quantitative information on either the structure of the monolayers or their electronic properties was\nobtained.\nIn this paper we present new findings on the selfassembly, structure and electronic properties of a\nquasiperiodic monolayer. We have used the five-fold AlPd-Mn surface as a template for Pb adsorption at a range\nof fluxes and substrate temperatures. The initial growth\nand stability of the monolayer was studied by scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM). The structure of the Pb\nfilm is found to be \u03c4 -inflated compared to the quasiperiodic substrate, where \u03c4 , the golden mean, is an irrational\nnumber (=1.618...) associated with pentagonal geometry. The electronic structure of the system was measured by ultra-violet photoemission (UPS) and scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (STS), and it is demonstrated unambiguously that the aperiodic structure influences the\nelectronic density of states such that the Pb monolayer\n\n\f2\nexhibits a pseudogap at the Fermi level.\nThese experiments were performed under ultra high\nvacuum using low energy electron diffraction (LEED),\nAuger electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray and ultra violet photoemission spectroscopy (XPS and UPS respectively), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (VTSTM). The Al70 Pd21 Mn9 sample was cut perpendicular to its five-fold symmetry axis. Lead deposition was\ncarried out using an electron beam cell with a flux of\n2.5 x 10\u22123 ML/s. The Pb source was calibrated by means\nof XPS and STM using an Al(111) crystal.\nWe first outline the adsorption characteristics of the\nadsorption of Pb as monitored by AES and XPS. The\nevolution of the intensity ratio of the PbN OO (96 eV)\nand AlLV V (68 eV) Auger peaks as a function of dosage\ntime is plotted on Fig.1(a). The rate of adsorption of Pb\ndecreases with increasing Pb coverage; the curve initially\nrises exponentially and then reaches saturation at monolayer coverage. No further growth was observed under\nthe range of fluxes (2.5 x 10\u22123 ML/s - 2.5 x 10\u22122 ML/s)\nand substrate temperatures (57 K - 653 K) used in these\nmeasurements. The film was observed to desorb totally\nat a temperature of 670 K which is higher than the bulk\nmelting point of Pb. The Al 2p and Pb 4f core levels\nwere also recorded upon adsorption. The shape of the Al\n2p core level measured is identical to that of the clean\nquasicrystal surface for the monolayer as deposited at\nroom temperature or annealed to 653 K. The Pb 4f core\nlevel recorded from the quasiperiodic Pb monolayer has\nan identical shape and intensity to that measured from\n1ML of Pb grown on Al(111) (see Fig.1(b)). The lack\nof new components and chemical shifts within the core\nlevel peaks is consistent with the immiscibility of Pb and\nAl9,10 .\nWe now describe observations of the self-assembly of\nthe Pb monolayer at the atomic level. Fig.2 shows the\nAl-Pd-Mn surface after the adsorption of 0.2 monolayer\n(ML) of Pb. At this coverage, individual Pb atoms,\nincomplete pentagonal stars, complete pentagonal stars\nand networks of pentagonal stars are all visible on a single terrace. The formation of these networks indicates\nthat the Pb atoms are mobile enough to diffuse on the\nsurface11,12 . We have observed this network formation in\nthe temperature range 57-653 K. With increasing coverage, the density of stars increases with additional atoms\nfilling the interstices within the network. The edge length\nof the pentagon formed by joining the tips of these pentagonal stars is 4.9 \u00b1 0.3\u00c5 and they are mono-atomic\nin height. The smallest pentagonal structural elements\npresent on the clean Al-Pd-Mn surface have an edge\nlength of 3.0\u00c513 , i.e \u03c4 smaller than the smallest pentagon\nwithin the Pb structure. This \u03c4 -scaling of the basic structural elements is reflected in a \u03c4 -scaling of the complete\nmonolayer structure (described below).\nThe pentagonal stars all have the same orientation\non this terrace and on adjoining terraces, indicating\nthat they nucleate at unique sites. Pentagonal islands\n\nFIG. 1: a) Ratio of the intensities of the PbN OO (96 eV) and\nAlLV V (68 eV) Auger peaks as a function of the coverage\nin dosage time. b) XPS spectra of the Pb 4f core levels for\n1ML of Pb adsorbed on the five-fold Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal\nsurface (full curve) at 653 K and on Al(111) (dashed line).\nThe markers at 136.6 eV and 141.5 eV indicate the position\nfor elemental Pb.\n\nof a similar size and orientation were reported by Cai\net al. when dosing Al on the isostructural Al-Cu-Fe\nsurface7 . Both Al and Pb pentagonal islands are obtained regardless of the deposition rate, a fact characteristic of a heterogeneous nucleation process at specific\ntrap sites7,14,15 . However, Al starfish islands do not develop into a quasiperiodic layer upon further deposition,\nwhich is indicative of different kinetics in that system.\nThe structural characteristics of the completed Pb\nmonolayer are now described. The complete monolayer\nexhibits a well-ordered quasiperiodic structure as evidenced by the five-fold LEED pattern (inset in Fig.3)\nand from the analysis of atomically resolved STM images. The monolayer density is 0.09 atom/\u00c52 , deduced\nfrom the intensity of the Pb 4f core-level compared to\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Color online: 180 \u00c5 x 180 \u00c5 STM image for 0.2\nML of Pb adsorbed on the five-fold surface of Al-Pd-Mn.

Inset:\nLEED pattern recorded at 80 eV at the same coverage.\n\nthat measured of a Pb monolayer deposited on an Al(111)\nsurface (see Fig.1(b)). It exists two equivalent ways to\nimprove the overall structural quality of the Pb monolayer; either by depositing at room temperature then annealing at 653 K or by depositing Pb while maintaining\nthe substrate at 653 K . Fig.3 shows an STM image acquired following the latest procedure which is used for\nthe rest of the paper. The roughness of the film Zrms is\n0.2\u00c5, comparable to that of the quasicrystal substrate13 .\nA Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculated on a larger\nSTM image (not shown here) exhibits ten-fold symmetry,\nand is comparable to FFTs calculated from STM images\nobtained from the clean five-fold Al-Pd-Mn substrate except for a \u03c4 \u22121 scaling of distances in reciprocal space. A\npatch of a Penrose (P1) tiling superimposed on the Pb\nmonolayer emphasizes the quasiperiodic nature of the deposited monolayer (Fig.3). The tiling is composed of four\ntiles: the regular pentagon, the rhombus, the crown and\nthe pentagonal star. A similar tiling was derived from\nthe clean five-fold Al-Pd-Mn surface13 , but the tiles used\non Fig.3 are \u03c4 inflated compared to those found for the\nclean surface. This \u03c4 -scaling in the basic structure is also\nevident from a simple inspection of LEED patterns.\nThe electronic structure of the monolayer was probed\nusing UPS and STS. Fig.4(a) presents UPS measurements close to the Fermi level for the clean Al-Pd-Mn\nquasicrystal surface, an annealed Pb monolayer on the\nquasicrystal surface, and 1ML of Ag adsorbed on an annealed Pb monolayer on a quasicrystal surface. Using\na previously established procedure3 , the depth C of the\n\npseudo-gap was measured for the three systems. In this\nprocedure the depth parameter C = 0% is for a metallic sample and C = 100% for an insulator. Although a\nvalue of C = 35% is found for both quasiperiodic structures, the depth is reduced to 16% after deposition of\na disordered Ag monolayer on the Pb thin film. This\ndemonstrates that a single metallic layer is sufficient to\ngreatly enhance the spectral intensity in the vicinity of\nthe Fermi level.\nIn addition to UPS, STS measurements were collected\non the annealed Pb monolayer and the clean Al-Pd-Mn\nsurface (see Fig.4(b,c)). Normalised dI/dV spectra represent an average over 104 I(V) curves before differentiation. These results are tip independent and I(V) curves\nwere collected in a grid-like manner on different local\natomic configurations. The pseudo-gap appears larger\non the Pb structure (Fig.4(c)) than on the clean surface\n(Fig.4(b)). This effect is consistent with the UPS analysis, as the UPS signal includes a contribution from the\nsubstrate to the spectral intensity at EF ; STS measurements probe only the DOS of the top-most surface layer\nhence reducing the Al-Pd-Mn electronic contribution to\nthe signal detected. Furthermore, in a nearly free electron like system, the width of the gap scales with the\nlattice potential |VK | which is the product of the form\nfactor wK and the geometrical structure factor SK of the\ncrystal16,17 . The larger gap measured by STS on the\nPb film compared to the clean Al-Pd-Mn surface is expected, as the form factor wK is directly related to the\natomic number of the element probed. With an identical\n\n\f4\ncrystallographic structure for both the substrate and the\ndeposited monolayer, the heaviest element should open a\nlarger gap. We infer that the quasiperiodic structure is\nresponsible for the formation of this pseudo-gap.\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully used the Al-Pd-Mn\nsurface as a template to grow a monoelement quasiperiodic monolayer. The monolayer self-assembles via a network of pentagonal islands. The structure of the monolayer is \u03c4 -inflated compared to the surface of the substrate. The reduced chemical complexity allow us to correlate the quasiperiodic structure with the formation of a\npseudo-gap in the DOS at EF . The system represents an\ninteresting testing ground for further experimental investigations on the physical properties associated with\naperiodic order.\n\nFIG. 4: Color online: a) UPS measurements at the Fermi level\nfor several systems: clean surface (black, full line), a monolayer of Pb annealed on the quasicrystal (red, large dash),\nand with an additional Ag monolayer deposited (blue, small\ndash). b) and c) STS measurements on the clean and Pb\ndosed five-fold Al-Pd-Mn surface.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nD.
