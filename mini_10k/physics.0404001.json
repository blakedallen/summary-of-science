The lowest terms of these systems\n(1s2s2p3 6 S, 1s2s2p23s 6 P and 1s2s2p33d 6 P) have been\nstudied along B I isoelectronic sequence [2, 3, 4]. The\nstudies of higher excited sextet states (1s2p3 3s 6 S) have\nbeen lately reported [1]. However, energy level diagrams\nof these ions are still far from complete. Experimentally,\nthese levels are difficult to observe by conventional spectroscopic techniques, such as high voltage discharge in\ngas cell method, because these levels lie well above several\nionization limits of five-electron singlet states (see Fig.\n1). Even though they are metastable against autoionization, they usually de-excite and disappear by collisions\nwith other ions without radiative transitions. Fast beamfoil technique allows straight forward observations of radiative transitions produced by these sextet states [5, 6].\nIn 1992 beam-foil spectroscopy [2, 3] was used to provide initial data on low-lying sextet states in doubly excited boronlike nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine. Recent\nwork of Lapierre and Knystautas [3] on possible sextet\ntransitions in Ne VI highlights the significance in this sequence. They measured several excitation energies and\nlifetimes. Fine structures of the 1s2s2p2 3s 6 PJ states\nwere resolved and measured in O IV, F V and Ne VI\nby Lin and Berry et al [1]. There are no further results\nreported for transitions from highly excited sextet states.\nIn some works on beam-foil spectroscopy of sextet\nstates in B I isoelectronic sequence, their identifications\nshow rather weak lines and overwhelming blending prob-\n\nE= 1064 eV O VIII gs 2S1/2\n-------------------E=886 eV O VII gs 1s2s 3S1\n--------------------\n\n686.24 \u00c5\n\n5 electron sextet states O IV\n\naddress:\nblin@nd.edu;\nURL: http://www.nd.edu/~blin/\n\u2020 Electronic\naddress:\nBerry.20@nd.edu;\nURL: http://www.science.nd.edu/physics/Faculty/berry.html\n\nL\nS\nP\nD\n\n1s2s2p23p 6L\nO IV\n\n1\n\n--------------------\n\nE=326 eV O VII\n\ngs 1s2 S0\n\n--------------------\n\nE=188 eV O VI\n\ngs 1s22s S1/2\n\n-------------------_____________\n\nE=77 eV O V\nE=0 eV\nO IV\n\ngs 1s2 2s2 1S0\n2\n2\ngs 1s22s 2p P1/2\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Term diagram of the doubly excited sextet states of O\nIV.

Hence, accurate theoretical studies of sextet states\nin B I isoelectronic sequence are strongly needed to help\nidentifications. However, theoretical analysis of these\nfive-electron systems is difficult because strong electron\ncorrelation, relativistic corrections, and even QED effects\nhave to be included in the calculations [1, 4, 7]. Recent\nline identifications in the sextet systems were made on\nthe basis of MCHF and MCDF [1, 2, 4, 8] or on the basis of Z-expansion along B I isoelectronic sequence [1, 3].\nFrom these works 6 terms were determined.\nThe sextet states 1s2s2p2 3p 6 L, L=S, P, D and 1s2p3 3p\nP in B I isoelectronic sequence are well above several\nionization levels as shown in Fig. 1, and metastable\nagainst electric-dipole radiative decay to singly excited\nfive-electron states and against Coulomb autoionization\ninto the adjacent continuum 1s2 2l'2l\"nl 4 L due to different spin multiplicity.

In the wavelength region of\n665-675 \u00c5 the 1s2s2p23p 6 Do -1s2p33p 6 P transitions in O\nIV were expected. At an O2 + beam energy of 1.5 MeV,\nO2 + ions are mainly excited to terms of O2+ and O3+ .\nThere are no lines emitted from sextet states in O IV\nin Fig. 2(a). At an O+ beam energy of 1.7 MeV, O+\nions are mainly excited to terms of O3+ and O4+ . New\nand unidentified emissions appear in the spectrum in Fig.\n2(b).

Such energies were expected to be an optimum\nfor comparison and production of O3+ ions by ion-foil\ninteraction [19].\nThe beam current goes through a carbon exciter foil.\nThe foils were made from a glow discharge, had surface\ndensities about 10-20 \u03bcg/cm2 and lasted for 1-2 hours\nunder the above radiation.\nVUV radiation emitted by excited oxygen ions was dispersed by a 1m- Seya-Namioka grating-incidence spectrometer at about 90 degrees to the ion beam direction. A low-noise channeltron (below 1 count/min) was\nserved as a detector. Spectra were recorded at energies\nof 1.5 and 1.7 MeV with 100/100 \u03bcm slits (the line width\n(FWHM) was 1.1 \u00c5) and 40/40 \u03bcm slits (the line width\n(FWHM) was 0.7 \u00c5) in the wavelength range of 660-710\n\u00c5.\nWe also reinvestigated unpublished beam-foil spectra\nof 16 O3+ , 19 F4+ and 20 Ne5+ ions recorded previously by\naccelerating 16 O+ , 20 (FH)+ and 20 Ne+ ions to energies of\n2.5 MeV, 2.5 MeV and 4.0 MeV at the University of Lyon\nand Argonne National Lab. The line widths (FWHM)\nwere 0.4 \u00c5, 0.8 \u00c5 and 0.3 \u00c5 in the wavelength range of\n660-710 \u00c5, 560-640 \u00c5 and 490-540 \u00c5 in above spectra,\nrespectively.\n\nIntensity\n\n450\n\nD\n\n150\n100\n\nS\n50\n\nP\n\n0\n660\n\n665\n\n670\n\n675\n\n680\n\n685\n\n690\n\n695\n\n700\n\n705\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 2: Beam-foil spectra of oxygen, recorded at different\nenergies.

The precision of the profile-fitting program was\nchecked through several known transition wavelengths.\nMulti-configuration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method [8]\nwith QED and higher-order relativistic corrections [1,\n12, 13, 14], and Multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)\nGRASP code [9, 10, 11] supported analysis of the above\nexperimental spectra.\nIn MCHF approach, for a sextet state in a five-electron\nw2\nw3\nw4\nw5\nsystem (\u00df, LS=5/2JMJ )=(n1 lw1\n1 n2 l2 n3 l3 n4 l4 n5 l5\n6\nLJ , MJ ), where wi=0,1, ..., or min (2li +1), i=1,2,... 5,\nthe wavefunction is\n\n0\n667\n\nci \u03c6(\u03b2i , LS = 5/2JMJ ),\n\n667.5\n\n668\n\n668.5\n\n669\n\n669.5\n\n670\n\n702\n\n702.5\n\ni=1 MJ =\u2212J\n\n150\n\nExpt O+2.5MeV\nSCHF'\n5/2-7/2\n5/2-5/2\n5/2-3/2\n\n(b)\n120\n\nIntensity\n\n(1)\nwhere ci is a configuration interaction coefficient, N is\ntotal number of configurations with the same LSJMJ\nand parity, and \u03c6(\u00dfi ,LS=5/2JMJ ) is a configuration state\nfunction (CSF).\nFirstly, single-configuration Hartree-Fock (SCHF) calculations where configurations are the desired levels, i.e.,\n1s2s2p23p or 1s2p3 3p, were performed. After updating\nthe MCHF codes, we carried out relativistic calculations\nwith an initial expansion of up to 4000 CSFs and a full\nPauli-Breit Hamiltonian matrix. For a five-electron system a CI expansion generated by a active set leads to\na large number of expansions. To reduce the number of\nconfigurations, we chose configurations n1 l1 n2 l2 n3 l3 n4 l4\nn5 l5 , where ni =1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, li =0, ...min (4, ni -1).\nWe did not include g electrons for n=5 shell. For MCHF\ncalculations of the lower states 1s2s2p23p 6 L, L=S, P,\nD, we chose 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d and 5s\nelectrons to compose configurations. For the 1s2p3 3p\n6\nP state we chose 1s through 4d electrons. Fine structure splitting is strongly involved in the experiments and\nidentifications. After determining radial wavefunctions,\nwe included relativistic operators of mass correction, oneand two-body Darwin terms and spin-spin contact term\nin both SCHF and MCHF calculations; these were not\nincluded by Miecznik et al [4].\nIn addition, we used the screened hydrogenic formula\nfrom [1, 12, 13, 14] to estimate quantum electrodynamic\neffects (QED), and higher-order relativistic contributions\nfor sextet states in five-electron oxygen, fluorine and\nneon.\nIn MCDF [9, 10, 11] approach, firstly, we used singleconfiguration Dirac-Fock approach (SCDF). A basis of\njj-coupled states to all possible total angular momenta J\nfrom two non-relativistic configurations, 1s2s2p23p and\n1s2p3 3p, was considered. For convergence we included\nthe ground state 1s2 2s2 2p of five-electron systems. After\ncalculating all possible levels for all J, eigenvectors were\nregrouped in a basis of LS terms.

Shown in Fig. 3(a) are details of the\n1s2s2p23p 6 Do -1s2p3 3p 6 P transition in O IV recorded\nat an O+ ion energy of 2.5 MeV. The curve SCHF'\nis convoluted theoretical profile of fine structure components with a Gaussian function. The experimental width of 0.4 \u00c5 for the oxygen spectrum was utilized. The transition rates to fine structure j=9/3 to\n3/2 of the lower state were results of single-configuration\nHartree-Fock (SCHF) calculations by this work. The\nwavelengths of fine structure components were calculated\nSCHF results plus a fitted shift for all five components.\nMeasured wavelength of a component is the weighted\ncenter of the fitted profile of experimental data. Experimental transition rate is proportional to area of a\npeak (fitted intensity\u00d7FWHM of the experimental data).\nThe curve \"Sum\" is summation of fitted fine structure\ncomponents of experimental data. Measured ratio of\nJ=9/2-7/2, J=7/2-*, J=5/2-*, J=3/2-* and J=1/2-*\ntransition rates at an ion energy of 2.5 MeV in Fig.\n3(a) is about 121\u00d70.4:76\u00d70.4:66\u00d70.4:55\u00d70.4:27\u00d70.4\n=4.79:2.92:2.58:2.19:1.00. * represents all possible j's of\nthe upper state 1s2p3 3p 6 Pj allowed by electric-dipole\ntransition rule. The ratio is slightly different from the\ntheoretical ratio of GF values of SCHF calculations of\n0.981:0.593:0.530:0.355:0.294 = 4.98:3.99:3.00:2.00:1.00.\nBased on above analysis we assign the set of lines as the\n1s2s2p23p 6 Do -1s2p3 3p 6 P transition in O IV, and determine their wavelengths with good accuracy of \u00b10.08\n\u00c5. The results are listed in Table I. The strongest transition related to fine structure components is the 1s2s2p2 3p\n6 o\nD9/2 -1s2p3 3p 6 P7/2 transition at the wavelength of\n668.95\u00b10.08 \u00c5.\nSpectral details of the 1s2s2p2 3p 6 So5/2 -1s2p3 3p 6 Pj\ntransition are shown in Fig. 3(b). The width of the line\nis wider than the experimental width of a resonance line\nof 0.4 \u00c5, but not wide enough to resolve fine structures\nof the upper state 1s2p3 3p 6 P. In the experimental profile, experimental separation of fine structures of the upper state seems larger than results of SCHF calculations.\nSimilar to above, after studying details of transitions theoretically and experimentally described above, and comparing with multi-configuration Hartree-Fock (MCHF)\nand multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations\nof O IV by this work, we were able to assign these unidentified observed lines as the 1s2s2p23p 6 Lo -1s2p3 3p 6 P,\nL=D, P and S electric-dipole transitions in O IV. Results\nof the identification and measurements of wavelengths of\nthe transitions are listed in Table I. Errors of wavelengths\nof \u00b10.08 \u00c5 are small mainly from calibration and curve\nfitting. The latter includes experimental and statistical\nerrors. In Table I average theoretical transition energy\nAV is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23p 6 Lo -1s2p3 3p\n6\nP transition energies (computed from fine structure lines\ncalculated by this work) with results of theoretical analysis. Experimental transition energy AV is the center of\n\ngravity of the 1s2s2p23p 6 Lo -1s2p33p 6 P transition energies (computed from observed lines) with results of experimental transition rate analysis. AVT is summation of\nabove average transition energy (AV), QED effect (QED)\nand higher-order correction (HO). Errors for calculated\ntransition energies in Table I are the root mean squared\ndifferences of calculated and experimental transition energies as given below in the table. We also list calculated\nnon-relativistic transition energies (N-REL). In Table I\nwe present measured fine structure wavelength values and\ncompared these with different theoretical values for O IV.\nThe experimental results are consistent with calculations\nafter considering experimental and theoretical errors.\n\nUsing similar experimental and theoretical analysis described above, we studied spectra recorded at a (FH)+\nbeam energy of 2.5 MeV. Through the use of optical refocusing we achieved spectroscopic linewidth of 0.7 \u00c5.\nThe wavelength accuracy is \u00b10.10 \u00c5 in the wavelength\nregion of 570-620 \u00c5 in the sprecta [23, 24]. In Table\nII all observed lines in the sextet system of F V are\nreported. Nine lines are new observations. For the\n1s2s2p23p 6 L-1s2p33p 6 P transitions fine structures of\nthe lower state 1s2s2p23p 6 L are resolved in the experiments. The strongest fine structure component is the\n1s2s2p23p 6 Do9/2 -1s2p33p 6 P7/2 transition at the wavelength of 577.50\u00b10.10 \u00c5.\nSimilarly, we studied spectra recorded at a Ne+ beam\nenergy of 4.0 MeV. Through the use of optical refocusing\nspectroscopic linewidth of 0.3 \u00c5 was achieved in the second order spectra. Fine structures of the lower and upper\nstate are resolved. The wavelength accuracy is \u00b10.05 \u00c5\nfor the 1s2s2p2 3p 6 LoJ -1s2p3 3p 6 PJ \u2032 , L=S, P, D transitions in the wavelength region of 490-555 \u00c5 [25, 26]. In\nTable III thirteen new observed lines in the sextet system\nof Ne VI are reported. The strongest fine structure component is the 1s2s2p2 3p 6 Do9/2 -1s2p3 3p 6 P7/2 transition\nat the wavelength of 507.13\u00b10.05 \u00c5.\nIn Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are plots of differences between\ntheoretical and experimental transition energies of the\n1s2s2p23p 6 Lo -1s2p3 3p 6 P, L=D, P, S transitions along\nbornlike isoelectronic sequence. Here, theoretical transition energy is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23p\n6 o\nL -1s2p3 3p 6 P transition energies (computed from fine\nstructure lines calculated by this work) with results of\ntheoretical analysis, and experimental transition energy\nis the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p2 3p 6 Lo -1s2p3 3p 6 P\ntransition energies (computed from observed lines) with\nexperimental results of transition rate analysis.\nIn Fig. 4 calculated SCHF and SCDF transition energy differences from experiments are constant for the\n1s2s2p23p 6 Do -1s2p3 3p 6 P transitions for nuclear charge\nZ = 8, 9 and 10.

We performed MCHF (with\nQED and higher-order corrections) and MCDF calcula-\n\n\f8\n\n300\n\nQEDSCHF\nHOSCHF\nQEDM CHF\nHOM CHF\n\n(a)\n\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n-200\n\ntions for 2s-2p transitions between doubly excited sextet\nstates of five-electron O IV, F V and Ne VI. Using calculated wavelengths and transition rates, we were able to\nidentify observed lines in fast beam-foil spectra of oxygen, fluorine and neon corresponding to the 1s2s2p23p\n6 o\nL -1s2p3 3p 6 P, L=S, P, D electric-dipole transitions in\nO IV, F V and Ne VI, and to measure wavelengths with\ngood accuracy. The measured results are compared with\nvalues of MCHD and MCDF calculations. They are in\nreasonable tendency. To extract QED and higher-order\ncorrections, accurate electron correlation is required.\n\n-300\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n400\n\nQEDSCHF\n\n(b)\n\n300\n\n11\n\nHOSCHF\nQEDM CHF\n\n200\n\nHOM CHF\n\n100\n0\n-100\n-200\n7\n\n400\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\nQEDSCHF\nHOSCHF\n\n(c)\n\n300\n\n11\n\nQEDM CHF\nHOM CHF\n\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n-200\n-300\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nNuclear charge Z\nFIG. 7: Isoelectronic comparison of QED and higherorder corrections of the (a) 1s2s2p2 3p 6 D-1s2p3 3p 6 Po , (b)\n1s2s2p2 3p 6 P-1s2p3 3p 6 Po and (c) 1s2s2p2 3p 6 S-1s2p3 3p 6 Po\ntransitions for B I sequence.
