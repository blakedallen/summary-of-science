These equations are derived from first principles and provide\na method for computing stabilities of arbitrary localized solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation\n(NLDE), a relativistic generalization of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We present a variety\nof such localized solutions: skyrmions, solitons, vortices, and half-quantum vortices, and study\ntheir stabilities via the RLSE. When applied to a uniform background, our calculations reveal an\nexperimentally observable effect in the form of Cherenkov radiation. Remarkably, the Berry phase\nfrom the bipartite structure of the honeycomb lattice induces a boson-fermion transmutation in\nthe quasi-particle operator statistics.\n\nProgress in condensed matter and particle physics has\nbeen periodically marked by significant mutual exchanges\nbetween the two disciplines, many proposals for which\nare realized in model systems of ultracold quantum gases\nin optical lattices [1\u20133]. Recent active areas of research\ninclude holographic dualities such as AdS/CFT [4], theoretical constructions of superstrings in ultracold quantum gases [5], chiral confinement in quasi-relativistic BoseEinstein condensates (BECs) [6], and our own derivation\nof the nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) describing ultracold bosons in a honeycomb optical lattice [7]. Our investigation into relativistic effects in BECs is motivated by\nthis spirit of cross fertilization with the aim of tying in\ntheory to experiment.\n\nthat exchange of two vortices leads to integer or halfinteger exchange statistics. It is not surprising that the\nelementary excitations in our theory exhibit a rich structure: a Dirac-like dispersion which obeys either bosonic\nor fermionic statistics depending on the strength of the\ncontact interaction. Consequently, in order to determine\nthe quasi-particle states and energies we cannot rely on\nthe Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations (BdGE) since these\nare based on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Instead,\nwe derive, from first principles, the RLSE which give the\ncorrect low energy dynamics for an arbitrary background\ncondensate. The RLSE are reducible to the BdGE in certain limits, and so may naturally be considered relativistic\ngeneralizations of the latter. Based on the RLSE we preIn this Letter, we develop the relativistic linear stabil- dict Cherenkov radiation that can be measured in experiity equations (RLSE) for the NLDE. Moreover, we find ments: the combination of lattice and particle interactions\nemergent nonlinear localized solutions [8] to the NLDE, results in a rich spatial distribution that is not seen in the\nincluding solitons, vortices, skyrmions, and half-quantum BdGE for the uniform case [9].\nvortices, the latter so-far unobserved in BECs.

(1)\nand (2) followed by a spatial parity inversion. This is similar to the BdGE where negative energy modes are allowed\nby symmetry but are ignored since the underlying Hamiltonian is positive-definite. It is important to note that for\na moving condensate, the negative-energy modes cannot\nbe removed and are crucial indicators of Cherenkov radiation. However, in our case, the Dirac Hamiltonian is\nnot positive-definite since our theory is defined at zero\nlattice energy, not the lowest energy Bloch state, so we\nmust respect the presence of both energy raising and lowering modes. Another important feature is that the RLSE\nare reducible to the BdGE when the local lattice potential\nenergy is the main contributor to the condensate chemical potential and the condensate is slowly varying (quasiuniform background), i.e., R|\u03bc| >> U , Ej \u2192 |\u03bc| \u2248 |\u03a30 |,\n\u2217\nwhere \u03a30 = \u03a30A(B) \u2261 \u2212 dr wA(B)\nH0 wA(B) is the local self energy for an arbitrary lattice site, with wA(B) =\nw(r \u2212 rA(B) ) the Wannier functions.\nQuasi-particle Operator Statistics. \u2013 Since we\nuse only bosons in our construction, and we have shown\nthat these collectively produce the spinor structure of\nDirac theory, it is natural to ask what are the quantum\nstatistics for collective excitations. When quantum fluctuations are weak, quasi-particle states are superpositions\nof direct products of bosonic operators and spinor singleparticle states: operators retain their bosonic structure.\nIn contrast, when the depletion of the condensate becomes\nsignificant, quasi-particle operators at each lattice site become sums of superpositions of terms each with a different\nphase, i.e., the single-particle bosonic operators b\u0302 and b\u0302\u2020\nbecome entangled with the on-site phase. We can illustrate this more rigorously. Consider a BEC in the thermodynamic limit: 1/N \u2192 0 and N/M = constant, where N\nis the total number of particles and M is the number of\nlattice sites. Also, we focus on the regime where U/th \u226a 1\nat T = 0. The ground state is then described by the superfluid density order parameter and the quasi-particles\nare coherent long wavelength fluctuations in the phase. A\nGutzwiller ansatz in terms of on-site number states provides an adequate formulation of the wavefunction. If we\nconsider increasing the particle interaction U towards the\ncritical value Uc that separates the superfluid from the\nMott-insulating phase, we would expect to see an increase\nin depletion of the condensate. The part of the wavefunction that describes particles outside the condensate has\ncomplete phase decoherence so that the phase fluctuations\nat the ith site, for Ni\u2032 particles outside the condensate, can\nbe described using the eigenstates of the phase operator\nin the number state basis [17]:\n\nPNi\u2032 \u22121\n\u03b8\u0302i \u2261 m=0\n\u03b8m |\u03b8m ii h\u03b8m |i where \u03b8m = \u03b80 + 2\u03c0m\nN \u2032 and \u03b80\nis a reference angle which must be averaged over when\ncomputing observables. In general, the depletion number\nNi\u2032 is a function of the total number of particles Ni and\nthe interaction U . When Ni\u2032 is large, this dependence on\nN and U can be incorporated into a coefficient fi (N, U )\nthat multiplies each term of the sum while maintaining\nthe relative sizes Ni << Ni\u2032 << 1:\nn\n\u221e\nX\n(fi ei\u03b80 b\u0302\u2020i )\n|\u03b8ii =\n|0ii = D\u0302(\u03b1) |0ii .\nn!\nn=0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b1i = fi ei\u03b80 and we have used the symmetric form for\n\u2020\n\u2217\nthe phase coherent state D\u0302(\u03b1) \u2261 e\u03b1i b\u0302i \u2212\u03b1i b\u0302i . The normalized quasi-particle operators can now be defined having\nthe correct Bogoliubov limit:\np\np\n\u00e2\u2020i = b\u0302\u2020i D\u0302\u2020 (\u03b1)/ 1 + |\u03b1|2 , \u00e2i = D\u0302(\u03b1) b\u0302i / 1 + |\u03b1|2 . (10)\nWith this definition, theDaverage\nnumber of bosons formE\ning a quasi-particle is b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 = 1 + |\u03b1|2 , where |\u03b1| encodes the degree to which the bare quasi-particle operators b\u0302 and b\u0302\u2020 are dressed or fused to the background\nphase. When working at the lattice scale it is clear that\nthe reference angle \u03b80 must be single-valued under one\nfull rotation so that the dependence on the polar angle\nis ei(\u03b80 +\u03b8) . However, when translating to the continuum\nlimit, the two triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice become identified with the same spatial point so that\na 2 \u2212 1 mapping of parameters is needed consistent with\nthe double covering map p : SU (2) \u2192 SO(3). The continuum quasi-particle statistics can then be determined by\ncomputing the Berry phase (holonomy) by adiabatically\ntransporting a quasi-particle through a suitable closed\npath and correctly accounting for the SU(2) structure of\nthe single-particle states. The path must remain within a\ndegenerate subspace of the Hamiltonian so that we may\nisolate the geometric phaseH from the dynamical phase.\nd\n|\u03a8\u03b1 (\u03b8)i with\nThe holonomy is \u03b3 \u2261 exp C d\u03b8 h\u03a8\u03b1 (\u03b8)| d\u03b8\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n(\u03b1)\n1+|\u03b1|2\n\nb\u0302 D\u0302\n|\u03a8\u03b1 (\u03b8)i = \u221a\n\n|0i and \u03b1 = f ei(\u03b80 +\u03b8)/2 . A straight\n\nforward calculation yields \u03b3 = exp(i\u03c0|\u03b1|2 ) demonstrating\nfermion exchange statistics when |\u03b1|2 = 1.\nPhysical Parameters and Regimes. \u2013 We list\nfirst the fundamental dimensionful parameters that we\nuse. They are as follows: the average particle density\nn0 , the chemical potential \u03bc, the lattice spacing a, the\ns-wave scattering length as , the mass of the constituent\nbosons M , and the lattice well depth V0 . Several relevant composite quantities may be constructed from\u221athese.\nThese are the effective\np speed of light cl = th a 3/2~,\nthe sound speed cs = U n0 /M , the interaction\nstrength\n\u221a\nU = 4\u03c0~as /M , the healingR length \u03be = th a 3/2~n0 U , and\nNi\u2032 \u22121\nX (ei\u03b8m b\u0302\u2020 )n\nthe\nhopping energy th = d2 r w\u2217 \u01240 w, where th depends\ni\n|\u03b8m i =\n|0ii\n(8) on a and V , respectively, through the overlap of Wannier\n0\nn!\nn=0\nfunctions and the lattice potential inside \u01240 . Two funwhere |0ii is the ground state wavefunction for the ith damentally important constraints regarding these quansite. With this definition, the ith site phase operator is tities should be stated. First, in order to avoid reaching\np-3\n\n\fL. H. Haddad and L. D. Carr\nthe Landau velocity at the band edge and creating unwanted excitations we require cl \u221a\n< cs , where\np cs is the\nsound\nspeed.\nThus\nwe\nrequire\nt\na\n3/2~\n<\nU n0 /M or\nh\n\u221a\n(th a 3/2~)(4\u03c0~2 as n\u0304/M )\u22121/2 < 1. For 87 Rb with th =\n~ \u00d7 103 Hz , a = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 m , as = 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 m , n\u0304 =\n2 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22123 , we get cl /cs . 0.17. Second, in order for\nour long-wavelength approximation to be\n\u221a correct, we require the NLDE healing length \u03be \u2261 th a 3/2~n0U \u226b a;\nusing the same values for the physical parameters, we find\n\u03be \u2248 9.43 a.\nNext, we discuss the physical regimes for our theory.\nFirst, consider the extreme weakly interacting regime, i.e.,\nn0 U/th \u226a 1. Then excitations of the ground state obey\nbosonic statistics. Furthermore, at length scales much\nlarger than the healing length, \u03bek \u226a 1 where k is a characteristic quasi-particle momentum, excitations are comprised of correlated particle-hole pairs that propagate with\na dispersion given by E \u221d k 1/2 . This is a Bose gas of composite particles in the sense that excitations of opposite\nspin are paired up (albeit non-locally) to form bosons. In\ncontrast, for \u03bek \u226b 1, excitations are particle-like which\ncorresponds to the case where spin eigenstates are excited\nindependently. These states reflect the bipartite structure\nof the lattice (multi-component) but are local objects and\nso also reflect the bosonic nature of the fundamental constituent particles. They exhibit a mixture of fermionic and\nbosonic properties having a Dirac-like dispersion \u221d k but\nwith quantum operators that obey bosonic statistics. This\nis a hybrid Dirac-Bose gas. On the other hand for moderate interactions, n0 U/th 6= 0 and close to the critical\npoint on the superfluid side, higher order processes become significant and quasi-particles become highly nonlocal objects. Here quasi-particles are heavily \"dressed\"\nin the presence of the background condensate and so acquire a geometric phase resulting in anticommutation relations for their associated creation and annihilation operators (see previous section). In this regime, the Bogoliubov approximation fails to provide a good model but we\nexpect that the Dirac spinor structure will remain robust\nagainst many-body effects with quasi-particles undergoing\na renormalization due to many-body interactions similar\nto the case of graphene [18]. This describes an interacting\nDirac gas.\nUniformly Moving Condensate. \u2013 Now we return\nto the RLSE and solve them for the simplest case of a uni\u221a\nform background \u03a8(r) \u2261 n0 eiq*r (1, C0 )T , where C0 \u2208 C\ncontains a relative phase, n0 is the average particle density, and q is the condensate momentum measured with\nrespect to the Dirac point. In order to obtain the coherence factors and quasi-particle dispersion, we must then\nsolve a 4 \u00d7 4 eigenvalue problem; the RLSE yield\np\nEk = c\u2032l ~q * k \u00b1 (cl ~k)2 + n0 U cl ~k .\n(11)\nIn keeping with the usual Bogoliubov notation found in\nthe literature, we may write Ek = (c\u2032l /cl ) q * ~\u01ebk0 \u00b1 Ek0\nwhere ~\u01ebk0 \u2261 cl ~k is the single quasi-particle energy for\n\np\nzero interaction and Ek0 = (\u01eb0k )2 + n0 U \u01ebk0 is the quasiparticle energy for a static background. The associated\ncoherence factors can then be written as |uk,A(B) | =\np\n(Ek0 + cl ~k)/ 4Ek0 cl ~k, |vk,A(B) | = |uk,A(B) |(+ \u2192 \u2212).\nThe full interacting\nisPgiven by \u0124RLSE =\nP\u2032 Hamiltonian\n\u2032\n\u2020\n1\n2\n0\nU\nn\nA\n+\nc\n~q\n\u2212\n(2\u01eb\n+\nn\nU\n)\n+\nl\n0\n0\nk\nk\nk Ek \u0109k \u0109k , where A\n4\nis the area of the plane. The first three terms are the\nmean-field and quantum corrections to the condensate\nenergy and the last accounts for the number of quasiparticles present in the system. The constant c\u2032l is defined in terms of the overlap integral between\nWannier\n\u221a\n\u2032\n3a\u03c4\n/2~,\nwhere\nstates at neighboring\nlattice\nsites\nby\nc\n=\nl\nR\n\u2217\n\u03c4A,B \u2261 \u2212 dr wA\n\u2207wB and \u03c4 = |\u03c4A,B | 1 .\nThe low energy behavior of the uniform condensate has\na rich structure. The q = 0 case corresponds to a condensate with zero crystal momentum measured from the\nDirac point but with momentum K relative to the lowest Bloch state of the crystal. The idea of a condensate\nin motion relative to its background has been treated in\nboth free-space as well as the case of a moving background\nlattice [19, 20]. Physically, the lattice potential is moving\nrelative to the stationary condensate (laboratory frame).\nTwo-body collisions reduce the momentum of some particles relative to the lattice (slowing down) and increase the\nmomentum of others (speeding up) corresponding to a finite depletion of the condensate. In the laboratory frame,\na two-particle collision appears as one particle gaining a\ncomponent of momentum to the left and the other a component to the right. This is consistent with the well known\nparticle-hole symmetry of the Dirac Hamiltonian: negative energy states can be interpreted as positive energy\nstates that propagate in the opposite direction. In our theory these are quasi-particles with momentum K \u2212 k (for\nthe K-Dirac point) relative to the lowest Bloch state.\n(\u00b1)\nFor q = 0 then, we get Ek\n\u2261 \u00b1Ek0 =\np\n\u00b1 (\u01eb0k )2 + n0 U \u01eb0k . The two energy regimes evident here\nare separated by the condition cl ~k/n0 U \u2261 \u03bek \u2248 1. At\n(\u00b1)\nshort wavelength, k\u03be \u226b 1 so that Ek \u2248 \u00b1(cl ~k+n0 U/2),\nwhere the dominant first term reflects only the presence\nof the honeycomb lattice, while the second term is a small\nmean-field Hartree shift due to the interaction with\np the\n(\u00b1)\nbackground. When k\u03be \u226a 1, we find Ek\n\u2248 \u00b1 k/\u03be.\nThese are collective excitations induced by the particle\ninteractions just above the condensate energy. The presence of negative energy modes means that the condensate may lower its energy through spontaneous emission\nof radiation. This process can be suppressed by introducing an anisotropy in the lattice by breaking the AB sublattice degeneracy with a deeper optical lattice in\none direction [21]. This results in an additional term\nin the dispersion opening up a mass gap 2meff at the\nDirac point. For the negative\np energy modes we then\n(\u2212)\nhave Ek (meff ) = 2meff \u2212 (\u01eb0k )2 + n0 U \u01eb0k so that ex1 Note that whereas for the effective speed of light we have [c ] =\nl\nm * s\u22121 , in contrast [c\u2032l ] = m2 * s\u22121 since \u03c4A,B is an integral over the\ngradient operator rather than the Laplacian.\n\np-4\n\n\fRelativistic linear stability equations for the nonlinear Dirac equation\n1\n\nNonlinear Localized Modes. \u2013 To obtain solutions\nof the NLDE that are localized in x, y for U > 0, we substitute the plane-polar ansatz \u03a8A (r) = cA exp[ipA (\u03b8)]FA (r),\n\u03a8B (r) = cB exp[ipB (\u03b8)]FB (r) into the NLDE. Then cA =\ni, cB = 1, and there are two possible combinations for\nthe angular functions: (i) pA (\u03b8) = (l \u2212 1)\u03b8, pB (\u03b8) =\nl\u03b8 ; (ii) pA (\u03b8) = (l \u2212 1/2)\u03b8, pB (\u03b8) = (l + 1/2)\u03b8, with\nl \u2208 Z. In particular, l = 0 in (i) corresponds to a\nvortex configuration in \u03a8A filled in at the core with\na nonzero soliton for \u03a8B . Solutions of this type exist\nfor different relative values of \u03bc and U and for several\nasymptotic\nvalues\np\npof the\np components: limr\u2192\u221e (\u03a8A , \u03a8B ) \u2208\n{(\u2212i U\u03bc , 0), (\u2212i U\u03bc , U\u03bc ), (0, 0)}. For l = 1, we obtain\nthe same types of solutions but with \u03a8A and \u03a8B exchanged. For l > 1, centripetal terms are present for both\nFA (r) and FB (r) so that we must have \u03a8A (0) = \u03a8B (0) =\n0 and both components are vortices with zero core den-\n\nB\nA\n\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\nA\n\nB\n\n|\u03c8 | , |\u03c8 |\n\n1\n\n(c)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n(d)\n\n1\n\nA\n\nB\n\n|\u03c8 | , |\u03c8 |\n\nCherenkov Radiation. \u2013 This usually refers to the\nanisotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation from a\nsource whose speed exceeds the local speed of light in some\nmedium [22]. This concept generalizes to any source moving through a medium at a speed that exceeds the phase\nvelocity of the elementary excitations of the medium. For\nexample, a BEC moving in the laboratory frame, or with\nrespect to a background, will \"radiate\" (emit particles)\nwhen its speed exceeds the sound speed. Moreover, the\nradiation will be emitted in a cone subtended by a specific\nangle in the direction opposite the motion of the BEC.\nThe RLSE can be used to demonstrate this effect in the\npresent context of a BEC in a honeycomb optical lattice.\nFor a BEC with momentum q > 0 measured from the\nDirac point, examination of the angular dependence of\nEk reveals an intriguing structure for the emission of\nCherenkov radiation. We observe the following properties\nfor Ek . (1) When v < cl , where v = c\u2032l q is the condensate\nspeed, all excitations have positive energy regardless of the\nangle of emission. (2) When v > cl , quasi-particle energies\nare positive only for emission angles (measured relative to\nq) for which \u03b8 < \u03b8c \u2261 cos\u22121 (\u2212cl /v) while all other modes\nhave negative energy corresponding to the emission of radiation in a backwards cone bounded by \u03b8c . When v = cl ,\n\u03b8c = \u03c0 marks the onset of radiation, in which case radiation is only emitted in the direction opposite q. This\nunique directional property of the radiation suggests an\nobvious detectable signature in the laboratory: a time-offlight analysis of a BEC prepared with precise values of\nthe parameters should show a predictable shift in the momentum distributions between the forward and backward\ndirections.\n\n|\u03c8 | , |\u03c8 |\n\ncitations require\np a minimum momentum determined by\ncl ~kmin =\n4m2eff + n20 U 2 . Alternatively, we can consider the effect of the confining potential: this sets a\n(\u2212)\nlower bound for quasi-particle energy given by |Ek(min) | \u223c\np\n(cl ~ 2\u03c0/R\u22a5 )2 + n0 U cl ~ 2\u03c0/R\u22a5 , where R\u22a5 is the characteristic trap radius in the 2D plane.\n\n0.5\n\n0\n(e) 0\n\nr/\u03be\n\n5\n\n(f) 0\n\nr/\u03be\n\n5\n\nFig. 2: Localized solutions of the NLDE, \u03a8A (red dashed\ncurves) and \u03a8B (blue solid curves), in units of NLDE healing length \u03be: (a) vortex/soliton, (b) ring-vortex/soliton, (c)\nhalf-quantum vortex, (d) planar skyrmion, (e) line skyrmion,\nand (f) line-soliton.\n\nsities. For the l = 1 case, we also obtain a skyrmion\nsolution for which the pseudospin S = \u03a8\u0304(r)\u03c3\u03a8(r) (with\nPauli vector \u03c3) exhibits an integral number of flips near\nthe core and approaches a constant value far from the core.\nThis feature\nis encoded in a topologically conserved charge\nR\n(1/8\u03c0) \u03a9 dr \u01ebij S * \u2202i S \u00d7 \u2202j S which one recognizes as the\n1\n1\nPontryagin index that classifies the mapping Sspin\n\u2192 S\u2202\u03a9\n1\n1\nwhere the two circles Sspin and S\u2202\u03a9 parameterize the rotations between the densities \u03c1A(B) and the polar angle\nrotation on the 2D boundary \u2202\u03a9 at spatial infinity. In\ngeneral, similar types of solutions exist for (ii) above. Analytical and numerical solutions are plotted in Fig. 2 for\nwhich different values of \u03bc/U and l allow us to obtain the\ndifferent asymptotic forms.\nBesides vortices with integer phase winding, we also\nfind solutions with fractional phase winding, called halfquantum vortices (HQVs). Ordinarily, analyticity (singlevaluedness) of the order parameter forbids the rotation\nof the phase of \u03a8 around the core to take on fractional\nvalues. In the NLDE, \u03a8 can acquire a coherent internal\nBerry phase in addition to an external phase whose angles are identified with the polar angle \u03b8 [23, 24]. Such\nstates may have half-integer winding in both the internal and external phase angles while remaining singlevalued overall. We obtain\np HQVs with asymptotic form\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u03a8HQV (r) = 2i n0 /2 e\u2212i\u03b8/2 [cos(\u03b8/2), i sin(\u03b8/2)]T ;\nthe complete solution is shown in Fig. 2 (c).\nWe also obtain one-dimensional kink-soliton, skyrmion,\nand line-soliton solutions. The kink and skyrmion solutions are obtained by a straight-forward substitution of\nthe ansatz \u03a8(x) = \u03b7 [cos(\u03c6) , sin(\u03c6)]T into the NLDE and\nthen considering the distinct cases where \u03c6 = constant\n\np-5\n\n\fL.

The line-soliton solution is obtained when both \u03b7 and \u03c6 are functions of x\nwith the additional condition that, at the origin, \u03b7premains\nbelow a certain value. This ensures that \u03bc2 < U/8 <\n(U + 1)/2U \u21d2 U < 3.365 and \u03bc2 < 0.649, which allows\nthe wavefunction to collapse away from the y-axis while\nthe nonzero wavefunction near and along the y-axis has\na Lorentzian form in the x-direction due to the attractive\neffect from the kinetic terms.\nLocalized Mode Stability. \u2013 To check the stability\nof our localized solutions we substitute the corresponding solution into the RLSE and obtain the low energy\nspectrum. For the case of the vortex/soliton (l = 0),\nwe solve the eigenvalue problem numerically and obtain\nE0 = \u22123.9274+0.0020 i in units of n0 U . Similar to the case\nof a trapped rotating BEC [25], we find that the lowest\nmode in the spectrum is anomalous with negative energy\nand positive norm. The coherence factors shown in Fig. 3,\nnear the core of the vortex, appear as |uk,A(B) |2 \u223c 10\u22122 ,\n|vk,A(B) |2 \u223c 10\u22125 so that uk,A(B) >> vk,A(B) . This mode is\ndynamically unstable due to the presence of a small imaginary component which gives a decay rate relative to characteristic oscillation time of 0.0020/3.9274 = 0.0005. The\nlowest quasi-particle energies for the other localized solutions are: \u22123.9276 + 0.0019 i; 2.634 \u00d7 102 + 9.96 \u00d7 104 i;\n\u22123.9274 + 0.0019 i; 7.8409 \u00d7 10\u22123\u2212 9.9993 \u00d7 102 i; 7.9349 \u00d7\n10\u22123 \u2212 9.9993 \u00d7 102 i; for the ring-vortex/soliton, halfquantum vortex, planar skyrmion, line-skyrmion, and linesoliton respectively, where all quantities are given in units\nof n0 U .\nIn conclusion, we have shown that an effective relativistic fermionic system may be designed using ordinary cold\nbosonic atoms as the underlying degrees of freedom. We\nsolved the resulting NLDE for different classes of nonlinear modes including half-quantum vortices. We derived\nand solved relativistic linear stability equations and gave\nexplicit criteria for experimental observation of Cherenkov\nradiation, as well as predicting an anomalous mode for the\nvortex/soliton solution.
