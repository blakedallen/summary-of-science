We argue\nthat such a behavior is a general feature of diffusion in disordered systems.\nPACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 05.40.Fb, 05.10.Gg\n\nInfiltration of diffusing particles from one material to\nanother is a widely investigated process in many fields\nof physics. In recent years much focus was diverted to\nthe problem when the diffusion in one or in both materials is anomalous, namely x2 \u223c t\u03b1 with \u03b1 6= 1 [1, 2].\nAmong many examples where this behavior is important\nare infiltration of water into porous soil [3], contaminant\ndiffusion [4], moisture ingress in zeolites [5] or in fired\nclay ceramics [6], diffusion of sugar through a membrane\nin a gel solvent [7], and polymer translocation through a\nmembrane pore [8]. Infiltration is also important in biologically motivated experiments. For example proteins\ndiffusion is anomalous in the cell and normal in the exterior, compartments on membranes indicate that diffusion\nof proteins is taking place between different regions with\nvaried diffusion mechanisms [9], morphogens are subdiffusing in extracellular environment where the diffusive\nproperties changes abruptly in space [10].\nConsider unbiased diffusion in one-dimension where\none type of diffusion takes place in x < 0 and another\nin x > 0. The infiltration of particles from one material\nto another may lead to an averaged net drift hxi. We\nshow that for subdiffusion the flow of particles may be\nin the opposite direction of the drift. Even more surprisingly, we find situations when asymptotically all the\nparticles are in one sample but the average drift hxi is\noppositely directed. This is a paradoxical behavior in\nthe following sense: let P (x, t) be the normalized probability density function\nR \u221e(PDF) of finding a particle at\ntime t in (x, x + dx), \u2212\u221e P (x, t)dx = 1. One can argue\nR\u221e\nrather generally that if limt\u2192\u221e 0 P (x, t)dx = 1, i.e. all\nR0\nparticles are in x > 0, then limt\u2192\u221e \u2212\u221e P (x, t)dx = 0\nwhich implies that P (x, t) = 0 for x < 0 (since P (x, t) \u2265\n0) and hence the\npositively directed\nR \u221e drift should beR \u221e\nlimt\u2192\u221e hxi = \u2212\u221e xP (x, t)dx = 0 xP (x, t)dx > 0.\nParadoxically in some cases of subdiffusion we find the\nopposite behavior limt\u2192\u221e hxi < 0 (even though all particles are eventually in x > 0). Similarly, in some cases\nlimt\u2192\u221e hxi = 0, but in the long time limit all particles accumulate\nin one sample, for example in x > 0,\nR\u221e\nlimt\u2192\u221e 0 P (x, t)dx = 1. The solution of these paradoxes is given in this Letter, as well as a derivation of hxi\n\nR\u221e\nand 0 P (x, t)dx.\nModel 1: Fractional diffusion equations [2, 11].-\nConsider the semi-infinite region x < 0 which has subdiffusive dynamics with exponent 0 < \u03b1\u2212 \u2264 1 and diffu\u2212\nsion constant K \u2212 whose units are mt2 /sec\u03b1 .

(1) with \u03b1\u2212 = \u03b1+ =\n\u03b1 and K \u2212 = K + = K yields for particles starting on\nthe origin x2 = 2Kt\u03b1 /\u0393(1 + \u03b1). For \u03b1\u2212 = \u03b1+ =\n1 this equation reduces to standard diffusion equation.\nWithout the boundary conditions (soon to be derived),\nEq. (1) is nearly useless. The underlying random walk\nmodel we consider is the continuous time random walk\n(CTRW) [1, 2, 14] which is now specified.\nModel 2: CTRW.-Consider a jump process on a discrete lattice with the lattice spacing a. For lattice points\nx < 0 a particle has the probability 1/2 to jump to one of\nits nearest neighbors. Waiting times on each lattice point\nare independent identically distributed random variables\nwith a common PDF \u03c8 \u2212 (\u03c4 ). For x > 0 a similar unbiased\nrandom walk takes place with a waiting time PDF \u03c8 + (\u03c4 ).\nOn the lattice point x = 0 (the boundary) a particle has\nthe probability to jump right q + or left q \u2212 = 1 \u2212 q + [15]\nand the waiting times are exponentially distributed with\na rate R0 . Such biased interface is due for example to\na difference of chemical potentials between the two samples [16]. Thus, a particle starting on the origin will jump\nsay to the right (with prob. q + ) after waiting an average\ntime 1/R0 , then on the lattice point x = a, it will wait\nfor time \u03c4 drawn from \u03c8 + (\u03c4 ), and then with probability\n1/2 will jump to the left or right. For subdiffusion the\n\u2212\nwaiting times have power law PDFs \u03c8 \u2212 (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 \u2212(1+\u03b1 )\n\n\f2\n\n102\n\n<x>\n\n101\n<x>\n\nP\n\nPnz (s) =\n\nP\n\n0\n\n10\n\n[18] from x = a to x = 0 and from \u2212a to 0, respectively. These first passage times in the continuum limit\nare one sided L\u00e9vy distributions whose long time (small\n\u221a\n\u2212\n/2\ns) Laplace transforms are [19] \u03c6\u2212 (s) \u223c 1 \u2212 as\u03b1 \u221a\n/ K\u2212\n+\nfor x < 0 and similarly \u03c6+ (s) \u223c 1 \u2212 as\u03b1 /2 / K + for\nx > 0. The Laplace transform of the probability to have\nexactly nz transitions to state \u03be(t) = 0 is easily found\nusing the Laplace transform convolution theorem [20]\n\n1\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(s) nz\n\u03c6\u0304 (s),\ns\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0304(s) = q \u2212 \u03c6\u2212 (s) + q + \u03c6+ (s).

The drift, hxi, and occupation fraction in x < 0, P \u2212 (t), calculated numerically for the CTRW\nmodel (open circles) with \u03b1+ = 0.75, K + = 0.138, \u03b1\u2212 = 0.3,\nK \u2212 = 0.385, q + = 0.7 and for the quenched trap model (filled\ncircles) with \u03b3 + = 0.9, \u03b3 \u2212 = 0.3 and q + = 0.7 (averaged over\n20 realizations of disorder). Dashed lines represent long time\nasymptotic Eqs. (5) and (16). The dashed-dotted line given\nby Eq. (15) describes how P \u2212 approach its limit P \u2212 \u2192 1.\nNotice that all particles flow to the left (P \u2212 \u2192 1), however\nhx(t)i > 0 namely particles drift to the right.\n+\n\nand \u03c8 + (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 \u2212(1+\u03b1 ) , as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. More specifically,\nusing standard Tauberian theorem the Laplace transform \u03c4 \u2192 s of the waiting time PDFs behave like\n\u2212\n+\n\u03c8 \u2212 (s) \u223c 1 \u2212 B \u2212 s\u03b1 , \u03c8 + (s) \u223c 1 \u2212 B + s\u03b1 when s \u2192 0\ncorresponding to \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e [2]. All along this work we denote the Laplace\nR \u221etransform by the variable in the parentheses f (s) = 0 dt e\u2212st f (t). The generalized diffusion\nconstants are given by K \u2212 = lima2 \u21920,B \u2212 \u21920 a2 /2B \u2212 and\nK + = lima2 \u21920,B + \u21920 a2 /2B + [17]. Our results are not\nchanged if on x = 0 the waiting times are power law\ndistributed like \u03c8 \u2212 or \u03c8 + instead of exponential. Large\nnumber of applications of the CTRW model are discussed\nin [1, 2, 14].\nThe drift hxi.-Using the CTRW approach we now\ncalculate the drift. The position of a particle is x =\nPN\ni=0 \u03b4xi , where \u03b4xi is the ith displacement and N is the\nrandom number of steps. Since the motion is unbiased\nin domains x < 0 and x > 0, we have\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nhx(t)i = a(q \u2212 q ) hnz (t)i ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere hnz (t)i is the average number of times a particle visited the origin. We define a three state process\n\u03be(t) = 0 if the particle is on the origin, \u03be(t) = +1 if\nthe particle is in x > 0 and \u03be(t) = \u22121 if the particle\nis in x < 0. In the long time limit the number of visits to the origin is independent of R0 since the average\nwaiting times in state + and \u2212 are infinite. The waiting times in states + and \u2212 are the first passage times\n\n\u03c6\u0304(s)\n\u0001.\ns 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(s)\n\n(4)\n\nUsing the small s expansion of hnz i and Eq. (2) we obtain\nfor \u03b1\u2212 < \u03b1+\n\u221a\n\u2212\n(q + \u2212 q \u2212 )\nK\u2212\nhx(t)i \u223c\nt\u03b1 /2 ,\n(5)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nq\n\u0393(1 + \u03b1 /2)\nwhich agrees well with simulation in Fig. 1. Similar expression is found for \u03b1+ < \u03b1\u2212 . The sign of the drift, i.e.\nits directionality, is determined by the sign of q + \u2212 q \u2212 ,\nand hxi = 0 if q + = q \u2212 . Eq. (5) shows that in the long\ntime limit the drift depends only on one diffusion constant in sample (\u2212) and grows in time with the exponent\nof the slower medium. This is a surprising result: hx(t)i\ncan be very far from the interface, deep in the faster\nsample x > 0, but still is independent of the properties\nof that region \u03b1+ , K + .\nBoundary Conditions and Solution of Model 1).-\nUsing the initial condition given by P (x, 0) = \u03b4(x) the\nsolution of Eq. (1) in Laplace space is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1+ /2\n+\n\u221a\ns\u03b1 /2\u22121 exp \u2212 |x|s\nK+\n\u221a\nP (x, s) = C + (s)\n\u03b8(x) +\n2 K+\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u2212 /2\n\u2212\n\u221a\ns\u03b1 /2\u22121 exp \u2212 |x|s\nK\u2212\n\u221a\n+C \u2212 (s)\n[1 \u2212 \u03b8(x)] , (6)\n2 K\u2212\nwhere \u03b8(x) is the step function. To find C + (s) and C \u2212 (s)\nwe need twoR boundary conditions. The conservation of\nprobability dxP (x, s) = 1/s gives\nC \u2212 (s) + C + (s) = 2.\n\n(7)\n\nFrom Eq.

Note that the\nboundary condition Eq. (12) has a form of convolution\nwhen \u03b1+ 6= \u03b1\u2212 .\nOccupation Fractions.-From Eqs. (6,10) occupation\nfractions, that is probabilities\nto be in x < 0 or in\nR0\nx > 0 are P \u2212 (s) = \u2212\u221e dx P (x, s) = C \u2212 (s)/(2s) and\n\u2212\n\n(15)\n\n2\n\nEq. (15) is in excellent agreement with numerical simulations (see Fig. 1).\nParadox and its explanation.-(i) We observe an averaged net drift from one material to another even if\nall particles eventually flow in the opposite direction. If\n\u03b1\u2212 < \u03b1+ and q \u2212 < q + the drift hxi is positive (see Eq.\n(5) and Fig. 1). However, the particles are accumulating\nin x < 0, that is P \u2212 \u2192 1 (see Eq. (14), Fig. 1). So, we\nhave the drift directed opposite to the flux of the particles\neven if all particles are eventually in the slower sample.\n(ii) If \u03b1\u2212 < \u03b1+ but the boundary is unbiased q \u2212 = q + ,\nin the long time limit the particles will be concentrated\nin the region x < 0. However, since q \u2212 = q + there is no\ndrift, hxi = 0. An explanation of these paradoxes is as\nfollows: Although the region with smaller \u03b1 will accumulate more and more particles in the long time limit there\nwill be always some particles in the opposite region where\n\u03b1 is larger. These particles are moving more freely and\ntravel far away from the interface which will compensate\nthe accumulation of particles in the region\nR \u221e with smaller \u03b1.\nIn other words while P + = 1 \u2212 P \u2212 = 0 P (x, t)dx \u2192 0,\nR\u221e\nx P (x, t)dx does not approach zero. While dynam0\nics in faster domain (x > 0) is clearly important (since\nhxi > 0), note that hxi is independent of the diffusion\nproperties of domain x > 0. Surprisingly, hxi Eq. (5)\ndoes not depend on \u03b1+ and K + as mentioned.\nModel 3: Quenched trap model.-We proceed to show\nthat effects discussed for the CTRW model and fractional diffusion equation are found also for systems with\nquenched disorder. Consider the quenched trap model\nwhere a particle is undergoing a one-dimensional random walk on a quenched random energy landscape on\na lattice [1, 22]. On each lattice point a random energy Ex is assigned, which is minus the energy of the\nparticle on site x, so Ex > 0 is the depth of a trap on\nsite x. The energies of the traps are independent identically distributed random variables with a common PDF\n\u03c1(E) = (1/Tg ) exp(\u2212E/Tg ). Once the energy at some\n\n\f4\nsite x is defined it stays constant in time (quenched disorder), which makes a difference with the corresponding\n\"annealed\" CTRW problem. The lattice is coupled to a\nheat bath with temperature T which leads to particles\nescape from site x and jumps to one of its nearest neighbors. The average time it takes the particle to escape\nfrom site x is given by Arrhenius law \u03c4x = exp(Ex /T ).\nA small change in Ex leads to exponential change in \u03c4x .\nThe PDF of the waiting times can be easily calculated\n\u03c8(\u03c4 ) = \u03b3\u03c4 \u2212(1+\u03b3) with \u03b3 = T /Tg and \u03c4 \u2265 1. For \u03b3 < 1\n(T < Tg ), all the moments of \u03c8(\u03c4 ) diverge which leads to\nanomalous diffusion [1, 2] aging [23], and nontrivial occupation times [24]. After averaging over different realizations of disorder the evolution of the PDF and the mean\nsquared displacement x2 of the model is described by\nthe subdiffusive exponent given by 2\u03b3/(1 + \u03b3) [1].\nWe define our composite quenched trap model such\nthat we have \u03b3 \u2212 in x < 0 and \u03b3 + in x > 0 and an interface\nlocated at x = 0. On the boundary a particle has the\nprobability to jump right q + or left q \u2212 = 1 \u2212 q + and the\nwaiting times are exponentially distributed. Numerical\nsimulations reveal the behavior that was found for CTRW\nmodel and fractional diffusion equations Eq. (1). Namely,\nfor \u03b3 \u2212 < \u03b3 + we find the drift (C is a constant)\n\nattracted previous interest [25]. We note that the\nsolution of fractional equation Eqs. (6,10) must be\nused with care. While this solution gives the correct asymptotic behavior of the occupation fraction\nP \u2212 \u2192 1 (when \u03b1\u2212 < \u03b1+ ) (see Eq. (14)), the correction term within the fractional\nframework\nP \u2212 (t) \u223c\n\u0011 \u03b1is\n\u0010\n\u2212 \u2212\u03b1+\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212\n+\n1 \u2212 q + K \u2212 /(q \u2212 K + ) \u0393\u22121 1 + \u03b1 \u2212\u03b1\nt 2 . This\n2\ncorrection term is different from the exact CTRW result\nEq. (15) (compare the Gamma functions). Thus, fractional equation works in the long time limit and already\nleading corrections to asymptotic solution show deviations from exact result.\n\nwhich is positive for q + > q \u2212 , while almost all particles\nare found in x < 0, P \u2212 \u2192 1 as shown in Fig. 1.\nRemark.-Boundary conditions of fractional diffusion\nequations and CTRW models are non-trivial and have\n\nTo summarize, we investigated infiltration in subdiffusive systems. Using the CTRW model we derived the\nboundary conditions of the problem which allow analytical solution of the fractional diffusion equations. Particles flow to the slower medium while the direction of the\naveraged drift is determined by breaking of symmetry,\nqL 6= qR in our model. This leads to interesting phenomena unique to anomalous diffusion: (i) all particles are\nfound in one sample (P \u2212 \u2192 1), but the drift is oppositely directed (hxi > 0), (ii) drift does not depend on\nproperties of fast medium (hxi is independent of \u03b1+ , K +\neven though hxi might be located deep in that medium).\nWe observe similar behavior for the composite quenched\ntrap model which points out to a broader generality of\nour results.\nThis work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation.
