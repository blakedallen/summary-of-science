In this paper, we want to partially confirm an old\nconjecture by Donaldson [19].\n\u2217 The\n\nauthor is partially supported by NSF grant.\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.1. If there exists a degenerating geodesic ray in the space of K\u00e4hler\npotentials tamed by a bounded ambient geometry, then either there is no constant\nscalar curvature (cscK) metric in this K\u00e4hler class, or there is a holomorphic\nline consisting of cscK metrics only which is parallel to this degenerating geodesic\nray.\nA complete resolution of Donaldson's conjecture is still out of reach at the\npresent stage. For detailed references in this subject, readers are encouraged to\nread [9][8][10]. A geodesic ray in the space of K\u00e4hler potential is called degenerated ray if the K energy functional is non-increase along this ray. Definitions\nof the K-energy functional and degenerating geodesic rays will be given in Section 2. We will also discuss more about various aspects of this theorem.\nGoing back to Calabi's original view when he introduced the extremal K\u00e4hler\nmetric problem in [6], one memorable feature is that the daring idealistic pursuit\nof K\u00e4hler geometry mix with hard challenge in geometric analysis. While he\npainted a beautiful picture for us by promising that every K\u00e4hler class should\nadmit a best metric-extremal K\u00e4hler metric in his sense, the daunting challenge\nof solving it is close to being\"scaring\" since the Euler-Lagrange equation is a\nfully nonlinear 6th order PDE. In [7], E. Calabi showed us that the extremal\nK\u00e4hler metric always minimizes the Calabi energy locally. When he did this\nwork, we believe that he is only 60 years old and in the calculation of the second\nvariation of the Calabi energy, he only use 16 derivatives to arrive at a positive\nsign with easy. Since the day I became his student more than 20 years ago, I\nhave been wondering all the time if there is the word \"fear\" in his mind. 20\nyears after his work, we now know ( [23] in algebraic manifold and [10] in general\nK\u00e4hler manifold) that the extremal K\u00e4hler metric is also a global minimum of\nthe Calabi energy in the underlying K\u00e4hler class. Following [9], [21] [16], we\nknow that the cscK metric is a global minimizer of the K-energy functional as\nwell. A natural question is:\nConjecture/Question 1.2. In any K\u00e4hler manifold (M, [\u03c9]), is inf Ca(\u03c9\u03c6 ) >\n\u03c6\u2208[\u03c9]\n\n0 equivalent to inf E\u03c9 (\u03c9\u03c6 ) = \u2212\u221e?\n\u03c6\u2208[\u03c9]\n\nOne side of this question is already raised in [10]: if inf\n\n\u03c6\u2208[\u03c9]\n\nCa(\u03c9\u03c6 ) =\n\n0, then the K-energy bounds uniformly below in [\u03c9]? According to [10], if\ninf Ca(\u03c9\u03c6 ) = 0, then the U invariant of all smooth degenerating geodesic\n\n\u03c6\u2208[\u03c9]\n\nrays vanishes. It follows that (M, [\u03c9]) is geodesic semi-stable with respect to\nall smooth geodesic rays. Alternatively, in algebraic setting, by Donaldson [23],\nthe underlying polarization must be Semi-K stable in the sense that generalized\nDonaldson-Futaki invariant must be non-positive. In particular, the CalabiFutaki invariant must vanish in (M, [\u03c9]). One intriguing question is if SemiK-Stability or the vanishing of the Calabi-Futaki invariant alone is sufficient\nto imply the existence of a uniform lower bound on the K-energy functional in\n(M, [\u03c9])? At least the answer to the second part of this question is negative,\n2\n\n\fthanks to a beautiful example constructed by S. K. Donaldson [22]. Essentially\nby blowing-up CP 2 at various symmetric positions, Donaldson constructed a\ntoric surface where the Calabi-Futaki invariant vanishes, but the K-energy functional approaches to \u2212\u221e along at least one degeneration. In the same example,\nhe already showed us that, along this degeneration, the Donaldson-Futaki invariant is strictly negative. Consequently, it follows by another theorem of\nDonaldson [23] in algebraic case (or [10] in general), that the infimum of the\nCalabi energy in this K\u00e4hler manifold must be strictly positive. Thus, the question raised in [10] (or at the beginning of this paragraph) survives this subtle\nexample of Donaldson. Nonetheless, this is a highly interesting example and\nthe author believes that more can be learnt from this example. For instance, we\nmay also check that the U invariant of the corresponding geodesic ray (parallel\nto this degeneration) must be strictly negative (c.f. [10]), etc.\nThis conjecture/question, as it states, is rather general, abstract and elusive\nin many aspects. Perhaps we can bring it down to earth by breaking it into\nseveral steps.\nConjecture/Question 1.3. Is any of the following statements implies that the\nunderlying K\u00e4hler class is Semi-K-stable (when applicable) and the K-energy\nfunctional in this class is uniformly bounded from below?\n1. there exists a cscK metric;\n2. there exists a degenerating ray such that the K-energy is bounded from\nbelow and the infimum of the Calabi energy along this ray is 0;\n3. there exists a critical sequence of K\u00e4hler metrics;\n4. the infimum of the Calabi energy over the space of K\u00e4hler potentials is 0.\nOne can of course ask similar questions by replacing geodesic ray with test\nconfiguration. Here we called a sequence of K\u00e4hler metrics {\u03c6i }(i \u2208 N) critical\nwhen a) sup |E\u03c9 |(\u03c6i ) < \u221e; b) inf Ca(\u03c9\u03c6i ) = 0. Here the first statement is\ni\u2208N\n\ni\u2208N\n\nwell-known by now (c.f. [9],[16] and [21] ). The 4th statement is exactly one\nside of Conjecture 1.2. For any convex function in finite dimensional manifold\nwith non-positive curvature, the second statement is correct, while it is not clear\nabout the 3rd statement. There is a counter example to the 4th statement in\nfinite dimensional manifold with non-positive curvature. However, it is not clear\nif one can \"realize\" such an example in the space of K\u00e4hler metrics. Obviously,\nit is intriguing either to find such a counter example or prove the part 4 of\nConjecture 1.3(readers are encouraged to read Section 3 for more discussions on\nthis direction). Note that Conjecture/Question 1.3.2 is a natural extension of\nwell known results (c.f. [9], [21] and [16]). We can prove this conjecture in some\nspecial case\nTheorem 1.4. In toric variety, Conjecture 1.3.2 holds among smooth toric\ninvariant K\u00e4hler metrics.\n3\n\n\fIn fact, this theorem holds whenever the geodesic conjecture of Donaldson [19] holds. In general, we can answer Conjecture 1.3.2 positively once we\nstrengthen the condition slightly.\nTheorem 1.5. If there exists a destabilized geodesic ray tamed by a bounded\nambient geometry such that the K-energy functional is bounded from below along\nthat particular ray; and if the infimum of the Calabi energy is 0 in this ray, then\nthe K energy functional has a uniform lower bound in the underlying K\u00e4hler\nclass. Moreover, this K\u00e4hler class is Semi-K-stable (whenever applicable).\nRemark 1.6. This is a surprising theorem since we only bound the K-energy\nalong one direction, while the space of K\u00e4hler potential is infinite dimensional.\nThe second condition on the ray is really crucial.\nAs an application, we prove the following theorem. In some way, this will\ngive us plenty of examples where the K-energy is bounded from below in a\nK\u00e4hler class which doesn't admit a cscK metric.\nTheorem 1.7. For any destabilized simple test configuration such that the central fibre admits a cscK metric, then the K-energy functional in the K\u00e4hler\nclass defined by nearby fibre is bounded from below uniformly. In particular,\nthis K\u00e4hler class of nearby fibre is Semi-K-stable(whenever applicable).\nNote that a K\u00e4hler class is Semi-K-stable if, for all test configurations, the\ngeneralized Calabi-Futaki invariant at the central fibre has a preferred sign.\nHowever, our theorem asserts that, as long as we have one simple test configuration where the central fibre is \"good \" in some sense (admitting cscK metric),\nit is enough to conclude that the underlying polarization is Semi-K-stable! This\ntheorem might be extended to more general setting. We delay more discussions\non possible generalizations to the last section.\nWe may view this theorem from a different angle now. The existence of a\nuniform lower bound on K-energy had been always associated with the existence\nof cscK metric in the same K\u00e4hler class. There is no explicit example 1 where\na lower bound on the K energy exists but no cscK metric in this K\u00e4hler class.\nIt is then worthwhile to review MuKai-Umermura 3 folds here. Roughly speaking, it is a compactification of P SL(2; C)/\u0393, where \u0393 is the icosahedra group(a\nsubgroup of SO(3) of order 60). This gives a large family of 3-folds where rich\ngeometry lives! According to G. Tian [40], one of these three folds, called it M1\nfor easy of notations, admits no KE metric in its canonical K\u00e4hler class. This\nis a famous example where the classical Calabi conjecture on the existence of\nKE metric fails while the Futaki invariant vanishes. Recently, Donaldson [24]\nshowed that, there is another 3-fold (denote as M0 ) in this family of 3-folds\nwhich lies in the closure of the orbit of M1 . Donaldson explicitly calculate\n1 no\n\nsuch example known to this author, but perhaps some experts knows.\n\n4\n\n\f3\nTian's \u03b1-invariant in M0 and he found it to be 65 > 3+1\n. By a theorem of G.\nTian, he then concludes that there is a KE metric in this 3-fold M0 .\n\nExamining this family of complex 3-folds more closely, we can understand a\nlot more about deformation theory of the underlying complex structures. First\nof all, we notice that M0 destabilizes M1 in the sense of Definition 1.7 of [10].\nOne can even construct a simple test configuration on MuKai-Umermura 3-fold,\nwhere the K\u00e4hler structure at nearby fibre is biholomorphic to M1 while the\ncentral fibre is biholomorphic to M0 . By the preceding theorem, we know that\nthe K energy functional in M1 must have a uniform lower bound in its canonical K\u00e4hler class although it admits no KE metric in its canonical class. In fact,\nmore can be said about geometry of MuKai-Umermura 3-folds. For instance,\nthe author and his student [12] can prove that, both K\u00e4hler Ricci flow and the\nCalabi flow initiated from some metric in canonical class in M1 will converge\nsmoothly to the cscK metric at M0 . This certainly fits in well with the picture\ndescribed by Theorem 1.7.\nA result similar to Theorem 1.7 will hold if a K\u00e4hler manifold (M, [\u03c9], J)\nis destabilized by another K\u00e4hler manifold (M, [\u03c9]\u2032 , J \u2032 ) where the destabilizer\nadmits a cscK metric. Definition of destabilizer is introduced in [10]. For Theorem 1.7 to be hold in this case, we need to modify the definition 1.7 [10] of\ndestabilization slightly (according to Theorem 1.5 above). In a sequeal paper of\nthis one, the author and his student will discuss alternative proof of results in\nalgebraic setting [13].\nOrganization In Section 2, we give a brief account of K\u00e4hler geometry including a proof of subharmonicity of the K energy over smooth solution on geodesic\nequation of disc version. In Section 3, we give a proof of Theorem 1.4 and 1.7.\nIn some sense, Theorem 1.7 is a corollary or application of Theorem 1.5. However, the proof of Theorem 1.7 at this section is independent of Theorem 1.5.\nIn Section 4, we give a proof to Theorem 1.5. In Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.1.\nAcknowledgment While the author obtained main results in this paper much\nearlier, the main writing is done during his visit to Tokyo Institute of Technology\nand University of Science and Technology of China this summer.

In all three papers,\n[30][36] and [19], the authors defined this Weil-Petersson type metric from various points of view and proved formally that this infinite dimensional space has\nnon-positive curvature. Using this definition, we can define a distance function\nin H: For any two K\u00e4hler potentials \u03c60 , \u03c61 \u2208 H, let d(\u03c60 , \u03c61 ) be the infimum\nof the length of all possible curves in H that connect \u03c60 with \u03c61 .\nA straightforward computation shows that a geodesic path \u03c6 : [0, 1] \u2192 H of\nthis L2 metric must satisfy the following equation\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (t) \u2212 g\u03c6 \u03b1\u03b2\u0304\n\n\u22022\u03c6 \u22022\u03c6\n= 0.\n\u2202t\u2202w\u03b1 \u2202t\u2202w\u03b2\u0304\n\nwhere\n\n\u22022\u03c6\n> 0.\n\u2202w\u03b1 \u2202w\u03b2\u0304\nAccording to S.

In fact, one\ncan consider (2.5) over any Riemann surface \u03a3 with boundary condition \u03c6 = \u03c60\nalong \u2202\u03a3, where \u03c60 is a smooth function on \u2202\u03a3 \u00d7 M such that \u03c60 (z, *) \u2208 H for\neach z \u2208 \u2202\u03a3.2 The equation (2.5) can be regarded as the infinite dimensional\nversion of the WZW equation for maps from \u03a3 into H (cf. [19]).3\nNext we introduce a well known functional in H here. The K-energy functional (introduced by T. Mabuchi) is defined as a closed form d E. Namely, for\nany \u03c8 \u2208 T\u03c6 H, we have\nZ\n(2.6)\n(d E, \u03c8)\u03c6 =\n\u03c8 * (R \u2212 R(\u03c6)) \u03c9\u03c6n .\nM\n\nNote that for any holomorphic vector field, we have\nFX ([\u03c9]) = (d E, \u03b8X )\u03c6 .\n2 We\n\noften regard \u03c60 as a smooth map from \u2202\u03a3 into H.\noriginal WZW equation is for maps from a Riemann surface into a Lie group.\n\n3 The\n\n7\n\n\f2.3\n\nGeodesic rays and geodesic stability\n\nIn this subsection, we collect some definitions, theorems from [10] which are\nuseful in this paper.\nDefinition 2.1. [10] A smooth geodesic ray \u03c1(t)(t \u2208 [0, \u221e)) is called special if\nit is one of the following types:\n1. effective if the Calabi energy of \u03c9\u03c1 in M is dominated by \u01eb * t2 for any\n\u01eb > 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\n2. normal if the curvature of \u03c9\u03c1 in M is uniformly bounded for t \u2208 [0, \u221e).\n3. bounded geometry if (M, \u03c9\u03c1(t) )(t \u2208 [0, \u221e)) has uniform bounds on curvature and uniform positive lower bounds on the injective radius.\nDefinition 2.2. Bounded ambient geometry A K\u00e4hler metric h = \u03c02\u2217 \u03c90 +\ni\u2202 \u2202 \u0304\u03c1\u0304 in ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 S 1 ) \u00d7 M is said to have bounded ambient geometry if\n1. it has a uniform bound on its curvature;\n2. ([0, T ] \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 M, h) has a uniform lower bound on injectivity radius and\nthe bound is independent of T \u2192 \u221e;\n\u2202\n3. The vector length | \u2202t\n|h has a uniform upper bound.\n\nLet h be a bounded ambient K\u00e4hler metric in [0, \u221e) \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 M. Suppose that\nits corresponding K\u00e4hler form \u03c9\u0303 is given by4\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u2202 2 \u03c1\u0304\n\u2202 2 \u03c1\u0304\n\u2202 2 \u03c1\u0304\n\u2217\ni\ni\nj\u0304\n\u03c02 \u03c90 +\nd w d w + 2Re\nd w d z\u0304 +\nd z d z\u0304.

Tamed by a bounded ambient geometry A smooth geodesic\nray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H is said to be tamed by a bounded ambient geometry h, if there\nis a uniform bound for the relative potential \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304.\nFor most purposes, \"weakly tamed by a bounded ambient geometry weakly\"\nis sufficient. In fact, any normal geodesic ray is expected to be tamed by some\nbounded ambient geometry, at least when it has bounded geometry. Any effective geodesic ray is expected to be tamed by some bounded ambient geometry.\nSince the space of K\u00e4hler potential is non-positively curved in the sense of\nAlexandrov [8], it is natural to introduce the notion of parallelism between two\ngeodesic rays.\n4 Here\n\n\u03c02 : ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 S 1 ) \u00d7 M \u2192 M be the natural projection map.\n\n8\n\n\fDefinition 2.4. [10] Any two smooth geodesic rays \u03c11 , \u03c12 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H, are\ncalled parallel if there exists a constant C such that\nsup\nt\u2208[0,\u221e)\n\n|\u03c11 (t) \u2212 \u03c12 (t)| \u2264 C.\n\nFor any smooth geodesic ray, there is some geodesic ray (perhaps in the weak\nform) which parallels to it as in Definition 2.5, but not necessary relatively C 1,1\n(with respect to the original rays). In [10], we made some attempt in this\ndirection and we quote our modest result here.\nTheorem 2.5. [10] If there exists a smooth geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H which\nis tamed by a bounded ambient geometry, then for any K\u00e4hler potential \u03c60 \u2208 H,\nthere exists a relative C 1,1 geodesic ray \u03c6(t) initiated from \u03c60 and parallel to \u03c1.\nSince the K energy is well defined for C 1,1 K\u00e4hler potential, so we defined\nan invariant as\nDefinition 2.6. For every relative C 1,1 geodesic ray \u03c6 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H, we can\ndefine an invariant as\nU(\u03c6) = lim inf (E(\u03c6(t) \u2212 E(\u03c6(t \u2212 1))).\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.9)\n\nClearly, in the case of smooth geodesic ray, this limit agrees with the invariant introduced in [10]:\nDefinition 2.7. [10]For every smooth geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H, we can\ndefine an invariant as\nZ\n\u2202\u03c1(t)\nU(\u03c1) = lim\n(R \u2212 R(\u03c1))\u03c9\u03c1n .\n(2.10)\nt\u2192\u221e M\n\u2202t\nNow we introduce notions of geodesic stability which already appear in [10].\nDefinition 2.8. [10] A smooth geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H is called stable\n(resp; semi-stable) if U(\u03c1) > 0 (resp: \u2265 0). It is called a destabilizer for H if\nU(\u03c1) < 0.\nFollowing the approach used in the algebraic case, we define (cf. [19]):\nDefinition 2.9. [10] A K\u00e4hler manifold is called geodesically stable if there is\nno destabilizing smooth geodesic ray. It is called weakly geodesically stable if the\ninvariant U is always non-negative for every smooth geodesic ray.\n\n2.4\n\nSubhamonicity of the K energy over WZW solutions\n\nSuppose that \u03c6 is a C 1,1 solution of (2.5), we denote by \u221a\nR\u03c6 the set of all\n(z, x) \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 M near which \u03c6 is smooth and \u03c9\u03c6(z\u2032 ,*) = \u03c9 + \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03c6(z \u2032 , *) is a\nK\u00e4hler metric. We may regard R\u03c6 as the regular set of \u03c6. It is open, but a\npriori, it may be empty. We have a distribution D\u03c6 \u2282 T (\u03a3 \u00d7 M ) over R\u03c6 :\n\u221a\n\u0001\nD\u03c6 |(z,x) = {v \u2208 Tz \u03a3 \u00d7 Tx M | iv \u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03c6 = 0},\n\u2200 (z, x) \u2208 R\u03c6(2.11)\n.\n9\n\n\fHere iv denotes the interior product. Since the form is closed, D\u03c6 is integrable\nwhen \u03c6 is smooth. We say that R\u03c6 is saturated in V \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 M if every maximal\nintegral sub-manifold of D\u03c6 in R\u03c6 \u2229 V is a closed disk in V. On any product\nmanifold, we may write any vector in D\u03c6 as\n\u2202\n+ X \u2208 D\u03c6 |(z,x) ,\n\u2202z\n\nwhere X \u2208 Tx1,0 M.\n\n(2.12)\n\nDefinition 2.10. A solution \u03c6 of (2.5) is called partially smooth if it is C 1,1 bounded on \u03a3\u00d7M and R\u03c6 is open and saturated in \u03a3\u00d7M , but dense in \u2202\u03a3\u00d7M ,\nn\nsuch that the varying volume form \u03c9\u03c6(z,*)\nextends to a continuous (n, n) form\n0\n0\non \u03a3 \u00d7 M , where \u03a3 = (\u03a3\\\u2202\u03a3).\nClearly, if \u03c6 is a partially smooth solution, then its regular set R\u03c6 consists\nn\nof all points where the vertical volume form \u03c9\u03c6(z,*)\nis positive in \u03a3 \u00d7 M .\nDefinition 2.11. We say that a solution \u03c6 of (2.5) is almost smooth if\n1. it is partially smooth,\n2. The distribution D\u03c6 extends to a continuous distribution in a saturated set\n\u1e7c \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 M , such that the complement S\u0303\u03c6 of \u1e7c is codimension at least 2\nand \u03c6 is C 1 continuous on \u1e7c. The set S\u0303\u03c6 is referred to as the singular set\nof \u03c6.\n3. The leaf vector field X is uniformly bounded in D\u03c6 .\nA smooth solution is certainly an almost smooth solution of (2.5). If the\nboundary values of a sequence of almost smooth solutions converge in some\nC k,\u03b2 topology, then the sequence converges to a partially smooth solution in\nthe C 1,\u03b2 -topology (k > 2, 0 < \u03b2 < 1).\nTheorem 2.12. [16] Suppose that \u03a3 is a unit disc. For any C k,\u03b1 map \u03c60 :\n\u2202\u03a3 \u2192 H (k \u2265 2, 0 < \u03b1 < 1) and for any \u01eb > 0, there exists a \u03c6\u01eb : \u2202\u03a3 \u2192 H in\nthe \u01eb-neighborhood of \u03c60 in C k,\u03b1 (\u03a3 \u00d7 M )-norm, such that (2.5) has an almost\nsmooth solution with boundary value \u03c6\u01eb .\nAn almost smooth solution of eq. 2.5 has uniform C 1,1 bounds and is smooth\nalmost everywhere. The K-energy functional is well defined for this family of\nK\u00e4hler potentials.\nTheorem 2.13. [16] Suppose that \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 H\u03c9 is an almost smooth solution\ndescribed as in Definition 2.11. Then the induced K-energy function E : \u03a3 \u2192 R\n(by E(z) = E(\u03c6(z, *))) is weakly sub-harmonic and C 1 continuous (up to the\nboundary).

Suppose f is a convex function in R2 such that f is non-increasing\nand uniformly bounded from below alone one half line. If in additionally we assume lim inf |\u2207f | alone this half line is 0, then f is bounded from below globally.\nWe remark that this lemma hold in any manifold with non-positive curvature. Following [8], the space of K\u00e4hler potentials is non-positive in the sense\nof Alexanderov. In the case of toric variety, there is a unique smooth geodesic\nsegment between any two invariant K\u00e4hler potentials. The K energy is convex\non smooth geodesic segment while the Calabi energy is precisely the norm of the\n\"gradient\" of the K energy functional in this infinite dimensional space. Thus,\nthe proof of Theorem 1.4 is exactly the same as the proof of this lemma. Now\nwe will give a proof to this lemma only.\nProof. Suppose Pi = (xi , yi ) is a sequence of points in this half line in R2 which\ndiverges to \u221e such that\n|\u2207f (xi , yi )| \u2192 0,\n\nand f (xi , yi ) \u2265 \u2212C\n\nfor some uniform constant C > 0. Let O = (0, 0) be the original point of this\nhalf line. Let Q = (x, y) be any other point in R2 . We want to argue that f (Q)\nis bounded from below by a constant independent of q.\n\n12\n\n\fConsider the sequence of triangle OPi Q(i \u2208 N). Set\n|OQ| = d,\n\n|OPi | = li \u2192 \u221e,\n\nand |Pi Q| = l\u0303i\n\nThen,\nli \u2212 d < l\u0303i < li + d,\n\n\u2200i \u2208 N.\n\nFurther more, when i large enough, we have\n0 < sin \u2220OPi Q \u2264\n\n10d\n.\nli\n\nLet ui , vi be the two unit tangent vectors at TPi R2 pointing to Q, O respectively.\nThen,\n100d2\n(ui \u2212 vi , ui \u2212 vi ) =\nli2\nSince Pi is in the same half line where the functional f is decreasing, then\n(\u2207f, vi ) |Pi \u2265 0.\nRestricting the convex function f in the line segment QPi , we have\nf (Q)\u2212f (Pi )\n|Pi Q|\n\nThus, we have\n\n\u2265 (\u2207f, ui ) |Pi\n= (\u2207f, vi ) |Pi +(\u2207f, ui \u2212 vi ) |Pi\n\u2265 \u2212|\u2207f |Pi * |ui \u2212 vi |Pi = \u2212|\u2207f |Pi *\n\n10d\nli .\n\n \u0303\nf (Q) \u2265 f (Pi ) \u2212 |\u2207f |Pi * 10d\nli * l i\n\u2265 \u2212C \u2212 |\u2207f |Pi * 20d.\n\nNow let li \u2192 \u221e, we have\n\nf (Q) \u2265 \u2212C.\n\nThe lemma is then proved.\nFrom the proof, the second condition is absolutely necessary. In fact, we\nhave the following counter example:\nf (x, y) = ex + y,\n\n(x, y) \u2208 R2 .\n\nWith respect to conjecture 1.3.4, it is false in finite dimensional as the following\nexample suggested.\n\u001a x2\nif x \u2264 0,\n2 \u2212 x,\nf (x) =\n\u2212 ln(x + 1)\nif x \u2265 0.\nThis is a convex function where\ninf |\u2207f |(x) = 0\n\nx\u2208R\n\nand\n13\n\ninf f (x) = \u2212\u221e.\n\nx\u2208R\n\n\fOn the other hand, the answer to conjecture 1.3.4 might still be correct because\nof the geometric structure attached to this problem.\nLet us first recall a theorem from [10].\nTheorem 3.2. [10] Let \u03c60 , \u03c61 be two arbitrary smooth K\u00e4hler potentials in the\nsame K\u00e4hler class. Then, the following inequality holds\np\nE(\u03c61 ) \u2212 d(\u03c60 , \u03c61 ) * Ca(\u03c61 ) \u2264 E(\u03c60 ).\n(3.1)\n\nHere d(\u03c60 , \u03c61 ) is the geodesic distance in the space of K\u00e4hler potentials.\n\nTo prove Theorem 1.7, we only need a weak version of Theorem 1.5 whose\nproof is much simpler.\nTheorem 1.5a. If there exists a destabilized geodesic ray such that the Kenergy functional is bounded from below along this given ray and if the Calabi\nenergy converges to 0 in the speed of o( t12 ) along the ray, then the K-energy\nfunctional has a uniform lower bound in the underlying K\u00e4hler class. (Here t\nrepresents the distance along geodesic ray from the initial potential in the ray.)\nMoreover, this K\u00e4hler class is Semi-K-stable (when applicable).\nWe give a proof to this weak version of Theorem 1.5a.\nProof. Suppose \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H is a destabilized geodesic ray such that the K\nenergy is uniformly bounded from below:\nE(\u03c1) \u2265 \u2212C,\n\n\u2200t \u2208 [0, \u221e)\n\nwhere C is some constant which change from line to line. Our assumption means\nthat\nlim t * Ca(\u03c1(t)) \u2264 C.\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.2)\n\nLet \u03c60 be any K\u00e4hler potential in H. For any t \u2265 1, apply Theorem 3.2 to\nthis case. By inequality (3.1), we have\np\nE(\u03c60 ) \u2265 E(\u03c1(t)) \u2212 d(\u03c6(0), \u03c1(t)) * Ca(\u03c1(t))\np\n\u2265 E(\u03c1(t)) \u2212 (d(\u03c6(0), \u03c1(0)) + t) * Ca(\u03c1(t)) \u2265 \u2212C.\nIt follows that the K-energy has a uniform lower bound in [\u03c9].\n\nBefore we give a proof of Theorem 1.7, we introduce an important proposition.\nProposition 3.3. [12] Given a simple test configuration \u039b \u2192 (M, J, \u03a9) \u2192 D.\nSuppose there exists a smooth\u221aS 1 invariant solution of the homogeneous complex\nMonge-Amp\u00e9r equation (\u03a9+ \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03a6)n+1 = 0, and denote the induced geodesic\nray by \u03c6t (t \u2208 [0, \u221e)). If the central fiber has cscK metric, then\n14\n\n\f1. the first derivatives of the K energy decay exponentially. Consequently,\nthe K-energy has a lower bound along the geodesic ray.\n2. there exists a geodesic ray from nearby fibre (tamed by this simple test\nconfiguration) where the Calabi energy decays exponentially as well.\nWe will delay the proof to the end of this section. We give a proof of Theorem\n1.7 here.\nProof. Suppose \u03c0 : \u03c7 \u2192 D with smooth central fiber. According to ArezzoTian [1], we can prove the existence of geodesic ray parallel to this simple test\nconfiguration, initiating from a nearby fibre (close enough) to the central fibre.\nIn [37], S. Sun gives an alternative proof to this beautiful existence problem.\nAccording to Chen-Tang [14], the U invariant of the induced geodesic ray is\nprecisely the evaluation of the Calabi-Futaki invariant in the central fibre. If\nthe Calabi Futaki invariant in the central fibre vanishes, then the U invariant\nof induced geodesic ray must be 0. In particular, this geodesic ray must be a\ndestabilizing geodesic ray.\nFrom the method of obtaining this geodesic ray, one can specify which limit\nmetric of a geodesic ray constructed from [37] will converges to (of course, up\nto a holomorphic transformation in the central fibre). This is very crucial here:\nWe need the geodesic ray converges to the cscK metric in the central fibre in\nthe limit. Then, we can have a ray whose K energy values bounded uniformly\nfrom below while the Calabi energy converges to 0. In other words, Prop. 3.3\nmay hold for this geodesic ray. Then, following Theorem 1.5a, we know that\nthe K energy in the entire K\u00e4hler class must be bounded from below.\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 3.3.\nProof. Let M be the total space of this simple test configuration M \u2192 \u25b3. Here\n\u25b3 is a unit disc in C. According to Arezzo-Tian [1] (c.f. [37] also), we can solve\na homogenous complex equation starting from nearby fibre:\n\u221a\n(\u03a9 + \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03a6)n+1 = 0.\nHere \u03a9 is the K\u00e4hler form in the total space M which is compatible to the\nassociated C \u2217 action of the test configuration. We might scale in \u03b4 direction if\nnecessary so that we solve this HCMA\u221aequation in M \u2192 \u25b3 with C \u221e regularities. For s \u2208 [0, 1], denote \u03c9s = (\u03a9 + \u22121\u2202\u2202\u03a6)|Ms . The geodesic ray \u03c6t starts\nfrom \u03c9 = \u03c91 , and it translates to the following equation in the space of complex\nstructures compatible with a fixed symplectic form:\ndJ\n= \u2212JDH,\ndt\nwhere H = \u03c6\u03070 is a fixed function, Jt = ft\u2217 J|M1 , and f \u0307t (x) = \u2212 12 \u2207t \u03c6\u0307t . In this\nlanguage, it is easy to see that the K-energy is convex along the ray:\nZ\nZ\nn\nn\nd2 E\n2\u03c9\n \u0307 2\u03c9 .\n|DH|\n|\nJ|\n=\n=\ndt2\nn!\nn!\nM\nM\n15\n\n\fBy definition, the limit of the first derivatives of the K energy is precisely the U\ninvariant of this geodesic ray. According to [14], this U invariant agree with the\nFutaki invariant of the central fibre. By our assumption, the Futaki invariant\nof the central fibre vanishes. Thus,\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\ndE\n= 0.\ndt\n\nTherefore, the K-energy will have a lower bound along the geodesic ray if we\ncould prove the right hand side decays exponentially fast. Now the geodesic\nray corresponds to a foliation by holomorphic discs in M \u2212 \u2212the total space of\nthe underlying simple test configuration. This foliation defines diffeomorphisms\n \u0303 = fs\u2217 (J|Ms ) is a\nfs : M1 \u2192 Ms (s \u2208 [0, 1]), which satisfy fs\u2217 \u03c9s = \u03c91 . Then, J(s)\nsmooth family of complex structures compatible with \u03c91 . Not surprisingly, this\nshould coincide with the previous family Jt up to a scaling of time parameter,\n \u0307 2 \u2264 Ce\u22122t for some constant C > 0,\ni.e. Jt = J \u0303e\u2212t . So J \u0307t = \u2212e\u2212t J \u0303 \u0307e\u2212t , and |J|\nwhich in turn proves the proposition.\nNote that the derivative of Calabi energy alone geodesic ray as\nR\nn\n| ddt Ca(\u03c9\u03c6(t) )| = | M H,\u03b1\u03b2 * R,\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c9\u03c6(t)\n|\nqR\nqR\nn\n2\n2 n\n\u2264\nM |DH| \u03c9\u03c6(t)\nM |DR(\u03c6(t)| \u03c9\u03c6(t)\n\u2264\n\nCe\u2212t\n\nfor some uniform constant C. This suggests that the limit of the Calabi energy\nexists along any smooth geodesic ray associated to the simple test configuration.\nSet\nA = lim Ca(\u03c9\u03c6(t) ).\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nThen, the difference |Ca(\u03c9\u03c6(t) ) \u2212 A| will converges to 0 exponentially fast.\nSmooth geodesic rays are constructed [1] from nearby fibers. From the way\nof construction, it is hard to control where the limit of these geodesic ray is.\nA new observation in [37] is that: S. Sun can specify which limit metric in the\ncentral fibre a priori; then he showed that there always exists a smooth geodesic\nray 5 whose limit is this preferred metric in the central fibre. If the central fibre\nhas cscK metric, it is convenient for us to choose a geodesic ray whose limit is\nthis cscK metric. For such a ray, we know that the limit of the Calabi energy\nmust be 0. It follows that the Calabi energy decays exponentially.\n\n4\n\nProof of Theorem 1.5\n\n4.1\n\nNotations and set up\n\nThis subsection is a technical preparation of next subsection.\n5 He\n\nmight have to chose a fibre much closer to the central fibre than what described in [1].\n\n16\n\n\fFor any two K\u00e4hler potentials \u03c60 , \u03c61 \u2208 H, we want to use the almost smooth\nsolution to approximate the C 1,1 geodesic between \u03c60 and \u03c61 .

For any integer l, let \u03a3(l) be a long \"oval shape\" disc such that \u03a3(l) is\nthe union of [\u2212l, l] \u00d7 [0, 1] with a half circle centered at (\u2212l, 12 ) with radius 12\nat the left, and a half circle centered at (l, 21 ) with radius 21 at the right. Note\nthat we want to smooth out the corner at the four corner points {\u00b1l} \u00d7 {0, 1}\nso that \u03a3(l) is a smooth domain6 . By construction, {\u03a3(l) } is a sequence of long\novals in this infinite strip \u03a3(\u221e) where \u03a3(0) is a disc of radius 21 centered at (0, 21 ).\nLet \u03c8 be a convex family of K\u00e4hler potentials in \u03a3(\u221e) given by\n\u2200(s, t) \u2208 \u03a3(\u221e) .\n\n\u03c8(s, t, *) = \u03c6\u0304(s, t, *)\n\n(4.1)\n\nHere \u03c6\u0304(s, t, *) can be any convex path connecting \u03c60 , \u03c61 . For instance, we may\nset\n\u03c6\u0304(s, t, *) = (1 \u2212 t)\u03c60 + t\u03c61 \u2212 Kt(1 \u2212 t)\nwhere K is a large enough constant. Here K must depend on \u03c60 , \u03c61 to ensure this family of potentials is convex. In this subsection, we assume that our\nboundary map \u03c8 is independent of s variable.\nConsider Dirichlet problem for the HCMA equation 2.5 on the long oval\nshape domain \u03a3(l) with boundary value\n\u03c6 |\u2202\u03a3(l) \u00d7M = \u03c8 |\u2202\u03a3(l) \u00d7M .\nAs in [9], we want to solve this via approximation method. For any \u01eb > 0,\nconsider the Drichelet problem:\n \u0304 n+1 = \u01eb * (\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c8)\n \u0304 n+1 ,\n(\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c6)\n2\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l) \u00d7 M\n\n(4.2)\n\nwith fixed boundary data\n\u03c6 |\u2202\u03a3(l) \u00d7M = \u03c8 |\u2202\u03a3(l) \u00d7M .\n\n(4.3)\n\nDenote the solution to this Dirichlet problem as \u03c6(l,\u01eb) for any l \u2265 1 and \u01eb \u2208\n(0, 1). For each fixed l, one can prove as in [9] that solutions \u03c6(l,\u01eb) to eq.(4.2)\n(4.3) have C 1,1 upper bounds independent of \u01eb.\nTheorem 4.1. [10] For every l fixed, there is a C 1,1 solution \u03c6(l) to the equation\n \u0304 (l,\u01eb) | is\n(4.2)(4.3) with \u01eb = 0. More importantly, this upper bound on |\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nindependent of l > 1 and \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1].\n6 The author wish to stress that we do this \"smoothing\" once for all: Namely, we smooth\n\u03a3(1) first. For any l > 1, we may construct \u03a3(l) (l \u2265 1) by replacing the central line segment\n{0} \u00d7 [0, 1] in \u03a3(1) by a cylinder [\u2212l + 1, l \u2212 1] \u00d7 [0, 1].\n\n17\n\n\fTheorem 4.2. [10] There exists a sequence of almost smooth solutions {\u03c6(l,\u01eb) , l \u2208\n \u0304 (l,\u01eb) | is uniform and independent\nN, \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1)} such that the upper bound of |\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nof l > 1 and \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1]. More importantly, when (l, \u01eb) \u2192 (\u221e, 0), this sequence\nof almost smooth solutions converges to the unique C 1,1 geodesic connecting the\ntwo end \"points\" (\u03c60 , \u03c61 ).\nBoth theorems are crucial in the proof of Theorem 1.5 below. However, we\nwill omit proof here. In Section 6, we will give proof to some more general\ntheorems in Section 5.\n\n4.2\n\nProof of Theorem 1.5\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1.5 largely follows from the proof of Lemma 3.1. However,\nwe have not proved that the space of K\u00e4hler potential is C \u221e connected by\ngeodesic segments yet. Thus, the proof of Theorem 1.5 is more complicated\nsince we need to overcome the lack of sufficient regularity.\nProof. Suppose \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 \u221e is a geodesic ray parametrized by arc length s\nsuch that\n\u2202\u03c1\nlim (d E,\n)\u03c1(s) < 0\ns\u2192\u221e\n\u2202s\nwith\n\u2202\u03c1\nk k\u03c9\u03c1(s) = 1,\n\u2200s \u2208 [0, \u221e).\n\u2202s\nFor any K\u00e4hler potential \u03c60 \u2208 H, consider the unique C 1,1 geodesic segment\nconnecting \u03c60 to \u03c1(l). Suppose the length of this geodesic segment is \u03c4 (l)(\u2200l >\n0). We denote this geodesic segment as \u03a8l : [0, \u03c4 (l)] \u2192 H. For any l large\nenough, we have\n=\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\nl\n(d E, \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202t |t=\u03c4 (l) )\u03c1(l)\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03a8l\n(d E, \u2202s |t=\u03c4 (l) \u2212 \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202s |s=l )\u03c1(l) + (d E, \u2202s |s=l )\u03c1(l)\n\u0011 12\n\u0010\nR\n\u00011 R\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03a8l\n2 n\n2 n 2\n(R(\u03c1(l))\n\u2212\nR)\n|\n\u2212\n|\n)\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n*\n(\n+ (d E, \u2202\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1(l)\n\u2202t t=\u03c4 (l)\n\u2202s |s=l )\u03c1(l)\nM\nM \u2202s s=l\n1\n\nCa(\u03c9\u03c1(l) ) 2 * (2 \u2212 2( \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202s |s=l ,\n\n1\n\u2202\u03a8l\n2\n\u2202t t=\u03c4 (l) )\u03c1(l) )\n\n+ (d E, \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202s |s=l )\u03c1(l) .\n\nWith l large enough, we can essentially treat \u03c4 (l) = l. According to CalabiChen[8], the infinite dimensional space H is a non-positively curved manifold\nin the sense of Alexandrov. Thus, the small angle at \u03c1(l) on this long, thin\ngeodesic hinge approaches 0 as l \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, it is smaller than the small\nangle of the corresponding long, thin hinge in Euclidean plane. Thus, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03a8l\n2\n0\u2264l * 1\u2212(\n)\u03c1(l) \u2264 100 d(\u03c60 , \u03c1(0))2 .\n|s=l ,\n\u2202s\n\u2202t t=\u03c4 (l)\nHere d(\u03c6, \u03c8) denote the geodesic distance between two K\u00e4hler potentials \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208\nH. Thus, we have\np\n10 Ca(\u03c9\u03c1(l) ) * d(\u03c60 , \u03c1(0))\n\u2202\u03a8l\n\u2202\u03c1\n(d E,\n|t=\u03c4 (l) )\u03c1(l) \u2264\n+ (d E,\n|s=l )\u03c1(l) . (4.4)\n\u2202t\nl\n\u2202s\n18\n\n\fNow, we need to compare the K energy at \u03c60 with \u03c1(l). For convenience, let us\nparametrize the geodesic segment between these two potentials in [0, 1]. Then,\nl\nthe length of \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202t is \u03c4 (l).\nFollowing [10], we set \u03ba : (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) \u2192 R be a smooth non-negative function\nsuch that \u03ba \u2261 1 on [\u2212 21 , 12 ] and vanishes outside of [\u2212 43 , 43 ].

The setup is a slight modification of the setup\nin Section 4.1.\nLet \u03a3(\u221e,m) = (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, m] \u2282 R2 denote a sequence of infinitely long\nstrips. Fix m \u2208 N, for any integer l, let \u03a3(l,m) be a long \"oval shape\" disc such\nthat \u03a3(l,m) is the union of [\u2212l, l] \u00d7 [0, m] with a half circle centered at (\u2212l, m\n2)\nm\nm\nat\nthe\nleft,\nand\na\nhalf\ncircle\ncentered\nat\n(l,\n)\nwith\nradius\nwith radius m\n2\n2\n2 at\n20\n\n\fthe right. Note that we want to smooth out the corner at the four corner points\n{\u00b1l} \u00d7 {0, m} so that \u03a3(l,m) is a smooth domain7 . By construction, {\u03a3(l,m) }\nis a sequence of long ovals in this infinite strip \u03a3(\u221e,m) where \u03a3(0,m) is a disc\nm\nof radius m\n2 centered at (0, 2 ).\nGiven \u03c60 and a degenerating geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H.

Let \u03c6\u0304 be any convex path connecting \u03c60 and \u03c1\u0304(0). Putting\nthis segment together with the initial ray \u03c1\u0304([0, \u221e)), adjusting it by first smoothing out the corner and then adding a function of \u03c4 only, we can obtain a\none parameter convex family of K\u00e4hler potentials. We denote this family as\n\u03c6\u0304 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H. Then, \u03c6\u0304 is essentially same as the initial geodesic ray \u03c1\u0304. By\nabusing notations, we may set\n\u03c6\u0304 = \u03c1\u0304.\nNote that the K energy of \u03c9\u03c1\u0304(\u03c4,*) (\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u221e)) is uniformly bounded from above\nand below.

According to Theorem 5.2, we know that for any t \u2208 [0, \u221e), we\nhave\nE(\u03c9\u03c6(t,*) ) = inf E(\u03c9\u03c8 )\n\u03c8\u2208[\u03c9]\n\n22\n\n\fis a K-energy minimizer. Since \u03c6(t, *) is the C 1,1 limit of a sequence of almost\nsmooth solutions, Theorem 5.3 implies that \u03c9\u03c6(t,*) is smooth K\u00e4hler form for any\nt \u2208 [0, \u221e). Thus, \u03c9\u03c6 has constant scalar curvature. It follows that \u03c6 : [0, \u221e) \u2192\nH is a smooth geodesic ray consisting of cscK metrics only. In particular, this\nmeans that the E(\u03c9\u03c6(t,*) ) is a constant function on t. By a direct calculation,\nwe have\nZ\nd2 E(\u03c9\u03c6(t,*) )\nn\n \u0304 (1,0) \u2202\u03c6(t, *) k2\n0=\nk\u2202\u2207\n=\n\u03c9\u03c6(t,*) \u03c9\u03c6(t,*) .\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\nM\nThen,\n \u0304 (1,0) \u2202\u03c6(t, *) = 0.\n\u2202\u2207\n\u2202t\n(1,0) \u2202\u03c6(t,*)\nis a holomorphic vector field. Therefore, \u03c6 : [0, \u221e) \u2192\nIt follows that \u2207\n\u2202t\nH represents a holomorphic line in H. The initial geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H\nis parallel to this holomorphic line by definition of \u03c6. Our theorem is then\nproved.\n\n5.2\n\nProof of Theorem 5.2\n\nWe need to prove a few Lemmas first. We follow notations from previous subsection.\nLemma 5.4. Let \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H be a degenerated geodesic ray tamed by a\nbounded ambient geometry. If the infimum of the Calabi energy along this ray\nis 08 , then E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) ) are uniformly bounded among this sequence of almost\nsmooth solutions in any domain \u03a3(l,m) .\nProof. Since the K-energy functional is sub-harmonic over solution to disc version of geodesic equation, we have\n\u2202 2 E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) )\n\u2265 0.\n\u2202z\u2202 z\u0304\nAt the boundary, we know\nE(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) (s, t, *)) = E(\u03c1\u0304(t, *) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) ) \u2264 C.\n\nBy the maximal principle, we know that E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) ) is uniformly bounded from\nabove. Here the upper bound is independent of l, m, \u01eb.\nIf we assume that there exists a cscK metric, then the K-energy functional in\n[\u03c9] has a uniform lower bound. Alternatively, if we assume that \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H is\na degenerating geodesic ray where the Calabi energy approaches to 0 in this ray,\nTheorem 1.5 also implies that the K-energy is bounded from below in (M, [\u03c9]).\nIn either case, we can apply these a priori estimate to prove that the K-energy\nfunctional E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) ) is uniformly bounded from below in (M, [\u03c9]). Our lemma\nis then proved.\n8 alternatively, we may assume that there exists a cscK metric and a geodesic ray with\nbounded K-energy .\n\n23\n\n\fLemma 5.5. If there exists a cscK metric and a degenerating geodesic ray where\nthe Calabi energy converges to 0 in this ray, then the first derivative of the Kenergy functional along the two \"long side\" is very small. More specifically, we\nhave\n\u2202E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) )\n|t=0 = 0,\n\u2202t\n3l\nand for any s \u2208 (\u2212 3l\n4 , 4 ), we have\n0\u2264\n\nq\n\u2202E(\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) )\nd(\u03c60 , \u03c10 )\n|t=m \u2264 C * ca(\u03c9\u03c1(m) ) *\n\u2202t\nm\n\nfor some fixed positive constant C.\n\nProof.

Note that for any 1 \u2265 \u01eb > 0 and l fixed, we have\n\u0001\n \u0304 (l,m,\u01eb) n+1 = \u01eb * (\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202 \u0304\u03c1\u0304)n+1\n\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\n2\n \u0304 (m,\u01eb) )n+1\n= (\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nwith boundary data\n\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\n=\n\u2264\n\n\u03c1\u0304 |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\u03c6(m,\u01eb) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\nBy the maximum principle for Monge-Ampere type equation, we have\n\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2264 \u03c6(m,\u01eb) ,\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M.\n\nCombining this with inequality (5.6), we have\n\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2264 \u03c6(m) ,\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M.\n29\n\n\fIt is easy to see that for any (l, m, \u01eb) we have\n\u03c1\u0304(s, t, *) \u2264 \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) ,\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M.\n\nNote that h(l,m) is a harmonic function on \u03a3(l,m) which can be viewed as a\npluri-harmonic function in \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M . Thus,\n \u0304 (m,\u01eb) \u2212 h(l,m) ) = \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\n \u0304 (m,\u01eb) ,\n\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202(\u03c6\n2\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M.\n\nThus, we have\n\u0011n+1\n\u0010\n \u0304 (m,\u01eb) \u2212 h(l,m) ))n+1\n \u0304 (l,m,\u01eb)\n= (\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202(\u03c6\n\u03c02\u2217 \u03c9 + \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nwith boundary data\n\n\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\n=\n\u2265\n\n\u03c1\u0304 |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\u03c6(m,\u01eb) \u2212 h(l,m) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\nThe last inequality holds because \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c6(m,\u01eb) when t = 0, m. In \u2202\u03a3(l,m) with\nt 6= 0, m, we have\nh(l,m) = K > \u03c6(m) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304 \u2265 \u03c6(m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304.\nBy the maximum principle for Monge-Ampere equation, we have\n\u03c6(m,\u01eb) \u2212 h(l,m) \u2264 \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) .\nIn particular, we have\n\u03c6(m) + o(\u01eb) \u2212 h(l,m) \u2264 \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2264 \u03c6(m) .\n\n(5.8)\n\nThus, the sequence of K\u00e4hler potentials \u03c6(l,\u01eb) converges to \u03c6(m) in \u03a3(\u03b4l ,m) \u00d7 M\nin the C 0 norm.\nIn fact, more is true.\nLemma 5.12. For any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), the sequence of K\u00e4hler potential \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb)\nconverges to \u03c6 in any sub-domain \u03a3(\u03b4l ,m) \u00d7 M in the C 1,\u03b1 norm.\nThis is just a corollary of Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 5.11. We are now ready\nto prove Theorem 5.2.\nTo obtain uniform C 1,1 bound of {\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) } independent of l, m \u2192 \u221e and\n\u01eb \u2192 0, we need to choose some appropriate background K\u00e4hler metric first. Let\nh be the ambient K\u00e4hler metric which tame the initial geodesic ray \u03c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192\nH. Then, the Dirichlet boundary value problem eq. 2.5 can be re-written as a\nDirichlet problem on \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u2202 2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)\n= \u01eb * det h\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 (n+1)\u00d7(n+1) ,\n(5.9)\ndet h\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 +\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u0304\n\u2202w \u2202w\n(n+1)\u00d7(n+1)\n30\n\n\fwith boundary condition\n\u03c6 |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M = \u03c1\u0304 |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M .\n\n(5.10)\n\nLemma 5.11 implies a uniform C 0 bound on the solution \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c6(m)\nwhere \u03c1\u0304 is a sub-solution of \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) . To obtain a super-solution, we define a\nsequence of (essentially) harmonic functions \u03c8\u0304 (l,m) by solving\n \u0303 (\u03c8\u0304 (l,m) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304) + (n + 1) = 0,\n\u25b3\n\n\u2200 (s, t, *) \u2208 \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M\n\nwith boundary data\n\u03c8\u0304 (l,m) |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M = \u03c1\u0304 |\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M .\n \u0303 is the Laplacian operator of the K\u00e4hler metric h. Since h is a smooth\nHere \u25b3\nmetric with uniform bound on curvature and injectivity radius in \u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M and\n\u03c8 is a smooth function with uniform bounds (independent of l), the standard\nelliptic PDE theory (interior and boundary estimate for harmonic function)\nimplies that there is a uniform bound on \u03c8\u0304 (l,m) (up to two derivatives for\ninstance). Note that\n\u03c1\u0304 \u2264 \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2264 \u03c8\u0304 (l,m)\n\nwith equality holding on \u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M. Consequently, we have the following\n\nLemma 5.13. The first derivatives of \u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304 in \u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7 M are uniformly\nbounded (independent of l).\nWe want to solve equation (5.9) and (5.11) for any large l, m \u226b 1. Following\n[9], we have\nLemma 5.14. There exists a constant C which depend only on the ambient\nmetric h ( but independent of l, m) and initial K\u00e4hler potentials \u03c60 , \u03c1\u0304(0) such\nthat either\n \u0303 (l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)) \u2264 C\ne\u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u0304) (n + 1 + \u25b3(\u03c6\nor\n \u0303 (l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)) \u2264 C *\ne\u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u0304) (n + 1 + \u25b3(\u03c6\n\nmax\n\n\u2202\u03a3(l,m) \u00d7M\n\n \u0303 (l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)).\ne\u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u0304) (n + 1 + \u25b3(\u03c6\n\nHere we assume \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304 is positive since it is uniformly bounded anyway.\nUsing the same boundary estimate as in [9], we can obtain a relative C 1,1\nestimate. Theorem 5.2 is then proved.\nTheorem 5.15. There exists a uniform constant C such that\n(n + 1) + \u25b3h (\u03c6(l,m,\u01eb) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304) \u2264 C.\n\n31\n\n\f6\n\nFuture Problems\n\nTheorem 1.7 is particularly interesting in the fano setting since we already know\nthat the existence of KE metric is equivalent to the properness of the K-energy\nfunctional. This naturally leads to an old conjecture of G. Tian where Tian\nconjectured that the K energy functional is proper if and only if there exists\na cscK metric in [\u03c9]. To better understand K\u00e4hler geometry from the point\nof view of this infinite dimensional space geometry, one may ask the following\nconjecture/question.\nConjecture/Question 6.1. The existence of cscK metrics implies that the\nK-energy functional is proper in the sense that it bounds the geodesic distance.\nNote that this version of properness is different from the one in Tian's original\nconjecture. Tian's conjecture is perhaps more elusive. There is a partial result\nin this direction which is a corollary of Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 6.2. Let \u03c60 be a cscK metric and let \u03c6 be any K\u00e4hler potential such\nthat \u03c9\u03c6 is uniformly elliptic. If the geodesic distance of \u03c6 to any holomorphic\nline passing thorough \u03c60 is greater than a fix constant \u03b4 > 0, then the K energy\nof \u03c6 is bounded from below by a constant C which depends only on \u03b4 and elliptic\nconstant of \u03c9\u03c6 .\nIn proof of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 6.2, we need to prove partially an old\nconjecture of this author.\nConjecture/Question 6.3. A global C 1,1 K-energy minimizer in any K\u00e4hler\nclass must be smooth.\nThis conjecture is proved in the Canonical K\u00e4hler class via weak K\u00e4hler\nRicci flow.\nAnother intriguing corollary of Theorem 1.1 is the following\nCorollary 6.4. cscK metrics implies geodesic stable. If there is a cscK\nmetric in the K\u00e4hler class, then U invariant of every geodesic ray must be strictly\npositive unless it is parallel to a holomorphic line initiated from a cscK metric.\nRecently, J. Stoppa [38] proves a beautiful theorem in algebraic setting which\nfits into this discussion very well. Assuming there is no holomorphic vector\nfields, he proves that the existence of a cscK metric implies that the underlying\npolarization is K-stable. This is very reminiscent to a famous work of G. Tian\n[40] where Tian proved that the existence of KE metric implies its polarization is\nK-stable with respect to special degenerations. We also would like to note that\nT. Mabuchi announced that he can remove this assumption on automorphism\ngroup, again in algebraic case. We will omit proofs to both corollaries since they\nbasically follow directly from the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nConjecture/Question 6.5. For any destabilized test configuration such that\nthe Calabi energy of nearby fibre approaches 0, if the total space is smooth or\n32\n\n\fif the central fibre only admit only mild singularities, and if the K-energy of\nK\u00e4hler metrics of nearby fibres are uniformly bounded from below, then the\ncorresponding polarization of nearby fibres has uniform lower bound on K energy\nand furthermore it is Semi-K-stable (whenever applicable).\nThe first important case to test is to show that Theorem 1.7 holds when:\na) the Riem. curvature of the total space has a uniform lower bound ; b) the\nK-energy over the family of fibre metrics has a uniform lower bound; c) the Calabi energy over the family of fibre metrics approaches to 0. In fact, the author\nstrongly suspects that semi-geodesic stability (perhaps also semi-K stability)\nwill imply the existence of a uniform lower bound of the K-energy functional.\nWhile we are in this topic, the following question is very interesting.\nConjecture/Question 6.6. In any K\u00e4hler manifold, if the K\u00e4hler Ricci flow\n(when applicable) or the Calabi flow initiated from one metric, converges to\na cscK metric (by sequence geometrically), then the K-energy functional must\nhave a lower bound in the original K\u00e4hler class.\nComing back to the variational nature of finding cscK metrics, the following\nquestion is interesting.\nConjecture/Question 6.7. For any critical sequence of K\u00e4hler metrics, can\nwe replace with another critical sequence where the curvature is uniformly\nbounded away from a measure 0 set? is this singular set has codimension 4?\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
