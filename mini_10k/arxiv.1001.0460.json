Thus, rather\nthan to give detailed arguments and to present all relevant results, our aim\nhere is to make the origin of this surprising result more easily visible.\n1\n\n\fQuantum effects in the classical gravitational field are observed, e.g. on\nneutrons [2, 3, 4], which are spin 12 particles. This motivates work on the\ncurved spacetime Dirac equation. The standard version of the latter (see\ne.g. Refs. [5, 6]) is due to Fock and to Weyl, and will be referred to as the\nDirac-Fock-Weyl (DFW) equation. On the other hand, two alternative Dirac\nequations in a curved spacetime were derived recently [7], by applying directly\nthe \"classical-quantum correspondence\", i.e., the correspondence between a\nclassical Hamiltonian and a quantum wave operator. Thus, together with\nthe standard (DFW) version, we have three distinct versions of the Dirac\nequation in a curved spacetime. The basic quantum mechanics was studied\nfor each of those three equations [8] (see Ref. [9] for a summary):\n\u2022 the Dirac probability current was defined for any possible field (\u03b3 \u03bc ) of\nDirac matrices. We derived the condition which has to be satisfied by\n(\u03b3 \u03bc ) in order that the current conservation be true for any solution of\nthe Dirac equation (for DFW, this condition is always satisfied);\n\u2022 the precise form of the relevant scalar product was shown to be imposed\nby the axioms of quantum mechanics (it turns out that, for DFW, this\nis the form used by Leclerc [10]);\n\u2022 the Hamiltonian operator was written and the condition of its hermiticity w.r.t. the relevant scalar product was derived in a general setting\n(for DFW, this condition coincides, in the particular case envisaged by\nLeclerc [10], with that derived by him).\nThat foregoing work showed, in particular, that the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is not stable under all admissible changes of the field of Dirac matrices.\nThis implies that there is a non-uniqueness problem for the curved-spacetime\nDirac equation.\nThe aim of the present work [1], therefore, was to study the (non-)uniqueness\nof the Hamiltonian and energy operators, including the (non-)uniqueness of\nthe energy spectrum. The qualitative conclusions are the same for the three\nversions, i.e., the non-uniqueness applies to the alternative equations of Ref.\n[7], too [1]. Thus, finding this non-uniqueness was disappointing for us as\nwell. In this paper, we will focus on the standard equation (DFW) and the\nnon-uniqueness results for it, because these results could be more directly of\ninterest to many physicists.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThree Dirac equations in a curved spacetime\n\nThe three versions of the gravitational Dirac equation have the same form:\n\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2212im\u03c8,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03bc = \u03b3 \u03bc (X) (\u03bc = 0, ..., 3) is a field of 4\u00d74 complex matrices, depending\non the point X \u2208 V in the curved spacetime (V, g\u03bc\u03bd ), such that\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd + \u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc = 2g \u03bc\u03bd 14 ,\n\n\u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 {0, ..., 3}\n\n(2)\n\n[here (g \u03bc\u03bd )(X) is the inverse of the matrix (g\u03bc\u03bd )(X) and 14 \u2261 diag(1, 1, 1, 1)];\nwhere \u03c8 is a bispinor field for the standard equation (DFW), but is a 4-vector\nfield for the two alternative equations, based on the tensor representation of\nthe Dirac fields (TRD);\nand where D\u03bc is a covariant derivative, associated with a specific connection.\nFor DFW, this is the \"spin connection\", which depends on the (\u03b3 \u03bc ) field\n[5, 6].\n\n3\n\nDefinition of the field of Dirac matrices\n\nFor DFW, one defines\n\u03b3 \u03bc (X) = a\u03bc\u03b1 (X) \u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith u\u03b1 = a\u03bc\u03b1 (X) \u2202\u03bc an orthonormal tetrad field (\u2202\u03bc is the natural basis\nassociated with the coordinates x\u03bc ) and (\u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ) a set of \"flat\" Dirac matrices,\ni.e., a constant solution of the anticommutation relation (2) with (g \u03bc\u03bd ) =\n(\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd ) \u2261 diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). One should be able to use any possible choice\nof (\u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ). One should study the influence of both choices: (\u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ) and (u\u03b1 ).\nFor TRD, a tetrad field can also be used, though other possibilities also\nexist, e.g. parallel transport [7].\nIn order to be able to use any possible field (\u03b3 \u03bc ) of Dirac matrices, we\nmust have recourse to the hermitizing matrix A of Bargmann and Pauli [12].\nThis is a 4 \u00d7 4 complex matrix such that\nA\u2020 = A,\n\n(A\u03b3 \u03bc )\u2020 = A\u03b3 \u03bc\n3\n\n\u03bc = 0, ..., 3,\n\n(4)\n\n\fwith M \u2020 \u2261 M \u2217 T = Hermitian conjugate of matrix M. We proved [11] the\nexistence of A, and also that of B: the latter is a positive-definite hermitizing\nmatrix for the \u03b1\u03bc matrices which are defined by Eq. (10) below. In general,\nA = A(X) is also a field. However, when we use the definition from a tetrad\nfield (3), we may take [8]\nA \u2261 A\u266f ,\n(5)\n\nwhere A\u266f is a (constant) hermitizing matrix for the constant set (\u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ). Moreover, in practice for DFW, one considers only sets (\u03b3 \u266f\u03b1 ) for which \u03b3 \u266f0 is a\nhermitizing matrix. (This includes the usual sets: Dirac's, \"chiral\", Majorana's, and any set deduced therefrom by a unitary transformation [13].)\nThus, in practice,\nA = \u03b3 \u266f0 for DFW.\n(6)\n\n4\n\nLocal similarities\n\nIn a curved spacetime (V, g\u03bc\u03bd ), the Dirac matrices \u03b3 \u03bc and the hermitizing\nmatrix A are fields: they depend on X \u2208 V. If one changes from one field\n(\u03b3 \u03bc ) to another one (\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc ), also satisfying the anticommutation relation (2)\nand with the same metric g\u03bc\u03bd , then the new field obtains by a local similarity\ntransformation [12], which is unique up to a complex factor [11]:\n\u2203S = S(X) \u2208 GL(4, C) :\n\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc (X) = S \u22121 \u03b3 \u03bc (X)S,\n\n\u03bc = 0, ..., 3.\n\n(7)\n\nFor the standard Dirac equation (DFW), the similarities are restricted to the\nspin group Spin(1, 3), i.e., they result from a change of the tetrad field by\na (proper) local Lorentz transform L(X) \u2208 SO(1, 3), depending arbitrarily\non X \u2208 V [5]. The corresponding local similarity transformation S(X) \u2208\nSpin(1, 3) is deduced [8] from L(X) through the spinor representation (defined\nonly up to a sign), L 7\u2192 S = \u00b1S(L).\n\n5\n\nThe general Dirac Hamiltonian\n\nRewriting the Dirac equation (1) in the \"Schr\u00f6dinger\" form:\ni\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n= H\u03c8,\n\u2202t\n\n(t \u2261 x0 ),\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fgives the Hamiltonian operator:\nH \u2261 m\u03b10 \u2212 i\u03b1j Dj \u2212 i(D0 \u2212 \u22020 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwith\n\u03b10 \u2261 \u03b3 0 /g 00 ,\n\n\u03b1j \u2261 \u03b3 0 \u03b3 j /g 00\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(10)\n\nOne should realize that, in a given spacetime (V, g\u03bc\u03bd ) and with a given field\nof Dirac matrices (\u03b3 \u03bc ), this operator still depends on the coordinate system,\nor, more exactly, on the reference frame [8]-the latter being understood\nhere as an equivalence class F of local coordinate systems (charts) on the\nspacetime V, modulo the purely spatial transformations\nx\u20320 = x0 , x\u2032j = f j ((xk )).\n\n(11)\n\nIn the present work, we fix the reference frame F and even the chart (the\nlatter being, however, an arbitrary one), and we study the dependence of the\nHamiltonian and energy operators on the field (\u03b3 \u03bc ).\n\n6\n\nScalar product and equivalent operators\n\nThe Hilbert scalar product is fixed by the following result [8]:\nTheorem. A necessary condition for the scalar product of time-independent\nwave functions to be time independent and for the Hamiltonian H to be a\nHermitian operator, is that the scalar product should be\nZ\n\u221a\n(12)\n(\u03c8 | \u03c6) \u2261 \u03c8 \u2020 A\u03b3 0 \u03c6 \u2212g d3 x.\nFor DFW, we have in practice A = \u03b3 \u266f0 , Eq. (6). Then (12) is the scalar\nproduct used by Leclerc [10].\nWith each of any two possible \"coefficient fields\": (\u03b3 \u03bc , A) and (\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc , \u00c3),\ncorresponds thus a unique scalar product. [For DFW, we have always \u00c3 =\nA = A\u266f , Eq. (5), so the coefficient fields reduce to the field of Dirac matrices \u03b3 \u03bc .] These two scalar products are isometrically equivalent through the\nmapping \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c8\u0303 \u2261 S \u22121 \u03c8: one shows easily [1] that\n(\u03c8\u0303  \u0303| \u03c6\u0303) = (\u03c8 | \u03c6).\n5\n\n(13)\n\n\fMoreover, H is fully determined by the set of the products (H \u03c8 | \u03c6), for\n\u03c8, \u03c6 \u2208 D \u2261 Dom(H). The same is true for the Hamiltonian H\u0303 after the\nsimilarity (7), H\u0303 being obtained by substituting \u03b3\u0303 \u03bc for \u03b3 \u03bc in Eq. (10), and\nby using the covariant derivatives D\u0303\u03bc \u2261 \u2202\u03bc + \u0393\u0303\u03bc in (9), with \u0393\u0303\u03bc the new\nconnection matrices [see Eq. (15) below]. It follows [1] that, in order that H\nand H\u0303 be equivalent operators, it is necessary and sufficient that\nH\u0303 = S \u22121 H S,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere S is the relevant similarity in Eq. (7). This, of course, is no surprise.\nOf course also, the same condition defines the equivalence of the energy\noperators E and \u1ebc, E being defined by Eq. (17) below.\n\n7\n\nInvariance condition of the Hamiltonian under a local similarity (DFW)\n\nWhen does a local similarity S(X), applied to the field of Dirac matrices\n(\u03b3 \u03bc ), leave the Hamiltonian operator H [equation (9)] invariant? I.e., when\ndo we have Eq. (14)?\nThe Hamiltonian (9) involves the connection matrices, \u0393\u03bc \u2261 D\u03bc \u2212\u2202\u03bc . For\nDFW, these matrices change after a similarity according to [6]:\n\u0393\u0303\u03bc = S \u22121 \u0393\u03bc S + S \u22121 (\u2202\u03bc S).\n\n(15)\n\nA straightforward calculation shows then that, for DFW, we have (14) iff\nS(X) is time-independent,\n\u22020 S = 0.\n(16)\nBut, in the general case, we have g\u03bc\u03bd,0 6= 0, hence any possible field (\u03b3 \u03bc )\ndepends on t \u2261 x0 . Thus, there is no way of finding a class of fields (\u03b3 \u03bc )\nexchanging with \u22020 S = 0. I.e.: The Dirac Hamiltonian is not unique [1].\n\n6\n\n\f8\n\nInvariance condition of the energy operator\n(DFW)\n\nWhen the Hamiltonian H is not Hermitian, one should use the Hermitian\npart of H :\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n\u221a\ni\nE=H+ \u221a\n\u2212g B =\nH + H\u2021 , B \u2261 A\u03b3 0 ,\nB \u22121 \u22020\n2 \u2212g\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the Hermitian conjugate operator H\u2021 is w.r.t. the unique scalar product (12). This Hermitian-symmetrized operator E coincides, in the particular\ncase envisaged by Leclerc [10], with what is called the energy operator, which\nis derived from the field Lagrangian. In the general case (thus for TRD and\nfor DFW as well, and with any possible (\u03b3 \u03bc ) field), the Dirac equation (1)\nalso derives from a Lagrangian [1]. We can show generally that the expected\nvalue of the energy operator E equals the classical field energy as derived\nfrom that Lagrangian.\nAgain a straightforward calculation gives the invariance condition of E\n(for DFW):\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2020\n\u0002\n\u0003a\nB(\u22020 S)S \u22121 \u2212 B(\u22020 S)S \u22121 \u2261 2 B(\u22020 S)S \u22121 = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nOnly very particular local similarities S(X) do verify (18). Thus, there is\na serious non-uniqueness problem for DFW (and for the alternative, TRD\nequations as well). Could even the spectrum of E be non-unique? In what\nfollows, we investigate this question.\n\n9\n\nExplicit expression of the energy operator\n(DFW)\n\nThe general expression of the change of E after a local similarity S(X) is\neasily found to be [1]:\n\u0002\n\u0003a\n\u03b4E \u2261 S \u1ebcS \u22121 \u2212 E = \u2212iB \u22121 B(\u22020 S)S \u22121 .\n(19)\n\nIn very general coordinates, the matrix (a\u03bc\u03b1 ) of that tetrad which defines\npthe\nstarting (\u03b3 \u03bc ) field may be chosen to satisfy a0 j = 0 [1].

Thus\np\nB \u2261 A \u03b3 0 = \u03b3 \u266f0 (a0 0 \u03b3 \u266f0 ) = g 00 14 ,\n(20)\nwhence from (19):\n\n\u0002\n\u0003a\n\u03b4E = \u2212i (\u22020 S)S \u22121 .\n\n(21)\n\u22121\n\nFor DFW, S(X) is an arbitrary Spin(1, 3) transformation.

(5.226)}. Any such matrix has two eigenvalues \u03bc \u2208 R and \u2212\u03bc, and has\nan orthonormal basis of eigenvectors: respectively u \u2208 C2 for \u03bc, and v for\n\u2212\u03bc.\n8\n\n\f11\n\nNon-uniqueness of the energy spectrum\n(DFW)\n\nA small perturbation of the starting Dirac matrices \u03b3 \u03bc is defined by a similarity close to the identity:\nS(\u03b5, X) = I + \u03b5 (\u03b4S)(X) + O(\u03b52).\n\n(27)\n\nIt modifies each eigenvalue of the energy operator E according to the wellknown formula\n\u03b4\u03bb = (\u03c8 | \u03b4E(\u03b5)\u03c8) + O(\u03b52),\n(28)\nwhere \u03c8 is the eigenfunction for the unperturbed state. Inserting \u03b4E (26)\nand the expression (12) of the scalar product into Eq. (28), and decomposing\nthe bispinor into two two-components spinors: \u03c8 = (\u03c6, \u03c7), we get:\nZ\nZ\np\n\u2020\n3\n\u03b4\u03bb = \u03c8 \u03b4E \u03c8 \u2212g g 00 d x = (\u03c6\u2020 N\u03c6 + \u03c7\u2020 N\u03c7) dV.\n(29)\nLet us fix \u03bc > 0 and t. For any spatial position x \u2261 (xj ) in our fixed chart,\nlet us select the 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrix with zero trace, N = N(x), in such\na way that \u03c6(x) be the eigenvector of N(x) for the eigenvalue \u03bc. (The 3vector x is the coordinate expression of the position x in the space manifold\nM associated with the arbitrary given reference frame F [8].) That is:\n\u03c6\u2020 N\u03c6 = \u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6.\n\n(30)\n\nSince N has the eigenvalues \u03bc and \u2212\u03bc, we have then necessarily\n\u03c7\u2020 N\u03c7 \u2265 \u2212\u03bc \u03c7\u2020 \u03c7.\n\n(31)\n\nIn Eq. (31), the inequality becomes an equality only if \u03c7(x) is an eigenvector\nof N(x) with eigenvalue \u2212\u03bc. In that case, \u03c6(x) is orthogonal to \u03c7(x) in C2 ,\n\u03c7(x)\u22a5\u03c6(x). Returning to Eq. (29), we see that\nif i) \u03c7(x)\u22a5\u03c6(x)\nR \u03b4\u03bb > 0 unless\nR\nfor almost every spatial position x, and ii) \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 dV = \u03c7\u2020 \u03c7 dV. This could\noccur only in extremely particular situations. In fact, i) alone implies [1] that\nthe probability current is light-like for almost every x, and this is impossible\nif m > 0 [15]. This proves the non-uniqueness of the DFW energy spectrum,\nat least for a massive particle.\n9\n\n\f12\n\nConclusion\n\nThree distinct gravitational Dirac equations were envisaged: the standard\nequation (\"Dirac-Fock-Weyl\" or DFW), plus two alternative equations [7]\nbased on the tensor representation of the Dirac field (TRD). Using the hermitizing matrix A, they were studied together, to a large extent [8, 1]. Nonuniqueness results have been proved for each of the three versions [1]. In this\npaper, we summarized the latter work, but focussed on the results for DFW.\nThe Hamiltonian operator H is not unique: it depends on the admissible\nchoice of the field of Dirac matrices. The same is true for the energy operator\nE. This is true for DFW and for TRD.\nThe spectrum of E is itself non-unique. All of these results apply already\nto a flat spacetime in a non-inertial frame.\n\nA\n\nAppendix: The classical energy and its\nframe dependence\n\nOne might ask if the non-uniqueness of the energy spectrum for a spin 12 particle in a curved spacetime, reported here, might have something to do with\nthe well-known fact that, in general relativity (GR), there is no covariant\nconcept of local energy-already in the classical context (as opposed to the\nquantum context envisaged in this paper). The latter fact may be formulated\nby saying that there is no covariant conservation law for the (total) energymomentum-the energy-momentum of the gravitational field giving rise only\nto a pseudo-tensor. As is well known, the usual \"conservation law\" for the\nenergy-momentum tensor of matter and non-gravitational fields \"does not\nexpress the conservation of anything\" [16]. However, for a classical test particle, in any arbitrary reference frame F, there is a well-defined Hamiltonian\nenergy [7, 17, 18], though it depends on F and, in general, on the time:\n\u2022 Geodesic motion in the Lorentzian manifold (V, g\u03bc\u03bd ) derives from the\n(\"super-\")Hamiltonian over the 8-dimensional phase space associated\nwith V:\n1\nH\u0303[(p\u03bc ), (x\u03bd )] \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd ((x\u03c1 ))p\u03bc p\u03bd\n(c = 1).\n(32)\n2\nThis is because, in a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, geodesic motion is\nidentical to free Hamiltonian motion, i.e., H\u0303 \u2261 T with T [(p\u03bc ), (x\u03bd )] \u2261\n10\n\n\f1 \u03bc\u03bd\ng p\u03bc p\u03bd\n2\n\nthe \"kinetic energy\": Sect. 45 D in Arnold [19]. Note that H\u0303\ndoes not depend on the (proper) time \u03c4 .\n\u2022 It follows from that \"time\"-independence that, in any given coordinate system, we deduce a \"normal\" Hamiltonian H over the usual,\n6-dimensional phase space, by dimensional reduction (Sect. 45 B in\nRef. [19]):\nH[(pj ), (xj ), t \u2261 x0 ] \u2261 p0\n(33)\nis extracted from\ng \u03bc\u03bd p\u03bc p\u03bd \u2212 m2 = 0.\n\n(34)\n\n{With the (\u2212 + ++) signature, we have H \u2261 \u2212p0 instead, and the\nlast equation writes g \u03bc\u03bd p\u03bc p\u03bd + m2 = 0 [18].} One may note that E =\nH \u2261 p0 is invariant under purely spatial coordinate changes (11), thus\nit depends only on the reference frame-which is arbitrary, but fixed in\nthe present study.\nTherefore, in a fixed reference frame, a classical test particle in a given external gravitational field has unique energy, in spite of the absence of a covariant\nconcept of local energy in GR, where gravitational dynamics are also included\nin the model. Similarly, the answer to the question posed at the beginning of\nthis Appendix is no. The non-uniqueness of the energy spectrum for a spinhalf particle in a given external curved spacetime, as found in this study, has\nnothing to do with the absence of a covariant concept of local energy in GR.\n\nReferences\n[1] Arminjon M and Reifler F 2009 A non-uniqueness problem of the Dirac theory\nin a curved spacetime Preprint arXiv:0905.3686 (gr-qc)\n[2] Colella R Overhauser A W and Werner S A 1975 Observation of gravitationally\ninduced quantum interference Phys.
