One of\nthe main challenges in dynamic spectrum access is to determine\nwhen the secondary (unlicensed) users can use the spectrum.\nIn particular, when the secondary user is using the spectrum,\nif the primary user becomes active to use the spectrum, it is\nusually hard for the secondary user to detect the primary user\ninstantaneously, thus causing unexpected interference and delay\nto primary users. The secondary user cannot detect the presence\nof primary users instantaneously because the secondary user\nis unable to detect the spectrum at the same time while it is\ntransmitting.

In particular, we\nemploy the Antennas Cancellation (AC), the RF Interference\nCancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation\n(DIC) techniques for secondary users so that the secondary user\ncan scan for active primary users while it is transmitting. Once\ndetecting the presence of primary users, the secondary user will\nrelease the spectrum instantaneously to avoid the interference\nand delay to primary users.

I NTRODUCTION\nOGNITIVE radio has been an effective method to solve\nthe problem of low spectrum utilization, which is caused\nby the current fixed frequency allocation policies [1]. In the\ncognitive radio networks (CRNs) [2], a challenging problem\nis that the secondary users (SUs) need to scan and identify\nthe spectrum state to verify whether the spectrum is used\nby the primary users (PUs) or not. In particular, when the\nSU is transmitting, it is usually hard for the SUs to identify\n\nC\n\nThis work is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award under Grant ECS-0348694, the 111 Project in Xidian University of China (B08038), National Natural Science Foundation of China\n(No.61072069), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\n(72101855&72105242), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi\nProvince of China (No.2010JM8001).\nThe major contents of this technical report will appear in IEEE Information\nSociety CISS 2011.\n\nthe presence of the PUs immediately, thus causing unexpected\ninterference and delay to PUs. This is because the SUs work\nin the wireless half duplex fashion, and thus cannot transmit\nand receive signals simultaneously.\nUnder the constraint of half duplex, previous works mainly\nfocused on using a periodic sensing scheme for SUs to periodically scan whether the PUs are presence again or not [3]\u2013\n[5]. Obviously, a too long detection time will deteriorate the\nthroughput of the SUs while a too short detection time will\nincrease the missed detection probability of SUs' sensing\nfor the active PUs. Therefore, we believe that the thorough\nsolution for the SUs to timely and efficiently detect the\nPUs is for SUs to transmit while listening to the channel\nsimultaneously, which implies that the SUs need to work in\nthe wireless full duplex fashion.\nThe reason why the full duplex cannot be used in wireless\ncommunications is that there is a large power difference\nbetween the local transmitted signals and the received signals\nfrom the other nodes, which makes it hard to subtract the\nlocal transmitted signals from the received signals. Recently,\nsome research works have shown the possibility of using\nfull duplex in wireless communications [6]\u2013[9]. By combining the Antenna Cancellation (AC), the RF Interference\nCancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation\n(DIC) techniques, the full duplex can be used in wireless\ncommunications [9]. The full duplex transmission mode can\nalso have a wide range of networking applications, such as\nmobile multicast networks [10]\u2013[12].\nIn this paper, we propose and evaluate the wireless full\nduplex scheme for CRNs. We characterize the PUs' packet\nloss rate in wireless full duplex CRNs and wireless half duplex\nCRNs. Considering that a number of factors can lead to the\nimperfectness of full duplex, we also analyze the effect of\nimperfect full duplex wireless communications in CRNs. We\nshow that by using full duplex in CRNs, the packet loss rate\nof PUs can be decreased significantly as compared with that\nin half duplex CRNs.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II\ndescribes the architecture of wireless full duplex nodes and\nthe CRN model. Section III analyzes and compares the PUs'\npacket loss rate in the wireless half duplex CRNs, the perfect\nwireless full duplex CRNs, and the imperfect wireless full\nduplex CRNs. Section IV evaluates our proposed wireless full\n\n\f2\n\nduplex in CRNs. The paper concludes with Section V.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nA. The Wireless Full Duplex Node Architecture\nIn wireless communications, because of the serious fading\nover wireless channels, the signal from a local transmit antenna\nis hundreds of thousands of times stronger than the signal\nreceived from the other nodes. Hence, it has been generally\nassumed that the wireless CRN node cannot decode a received\nsignal at a radio at the same time while it is simultaneously\ntransmitting.\nHowever, in principle it is possible to build the full duplex\nin wireless systems. Since the system knows the transmit\nantenna's signal, it can subtract the transmit signal from\nthe receive antenna's signal and decode the remainder using\nstandard techniques. The main factor preventing the full duplex\nin wireless system from its implementation is the large power\ndifference between the local transmit signal and receive signal\nwhich is sent by the other nodes. Therefore, once we remove\nthe large power difference by some reduction measures, we\ncan realize the full duplex transmission in wireless systems.\nSome works have revealed the possibility of using full duplex\ntransmission in wireless systems [6]\u2013[9]. In this paper, we\npropose the scheme of combining using the Antenna Cancellation, the RF Interference Cancellation, the Digital Interference\nCancellation techniques in CRNs. Fig. 1 shows the block of\ndiagram of a SU incorporating all the three techniques for\nfull duplex operation. In particular, for a wavelength \u03bb, two\ntransmit antennas are placed at d and \u03bb/2 + d away from the\nreceive antenna, respectively. Offsetting the two transmitters\nby half a wavelength causes their signals to add destructively.\nThis creates a null position where the receive antenna hears a\nmuch weaker signal (self-interference) compared with any one\nof the local transmit signals. After the Antenna Cancellation,\nthe self-interference has been attenuated to a low enough\nlevel. Then, we can use the RF Interference Cancellation\nand the Digital Interference Cancellation techniques to further\ndecrease the self-interference.\n\nTx1\n\nAntenna Cancellation\nRx\n\nRF Interference\nCancellation\nDigital Interference\nCancellation\n\nRF to\nBaseband\nADC\n\nDecoder\nFig. 1.\n\nTx2\n\nd\n\n\u03bb/2 + d\n\nThe Wireless Full Duplex Node Architecture.\n\nBaseband\nto RF\nDAC\nEncoder\n\nB. Cognitive Radio Network Model\nIn this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network with\ntwo input flows as illustrated in Fig. 2. Both of the arrived\nrate of PUs' and SUs', denoted by \u03bbp and \u03bbs , respectively,\nare assumed to be independent Poisson processes. The PUs'\nflow has preemptive priority over the SUs' flow. If one packet\narrives into the system and cannot be transmitted immediately,\nit will be stored in the corresponding buffer in a First-In-FirstOut (FIFO) manner where the buffer is assumed to be large\nenough and therefore no packet will be dropped due to the\noverflow.\nPrimary queue\nPrimary receiver\n\nPacket Flows\n\nChannel\nPacket Flows\n\nSecondary receiver\nSecondary queue\n\nFig. 2.\n\nSingle Channel Cognitive Radio Network Model.\n\nIII. A NALYSES OF W IRELESS F ULL\nCRN S\n\nAND\n\nH ALF D UPLEX\n\nMinimizing the interference caused by SUs to PUs is a\nchallenging problem in CRNs. When the PU becomes active\nto use the channel occupied by the SU, to minimize the\nSUs' interference to PUs, the SU must release the channel\nimmediately, which implies that the SU can constantly sense\nthe channel when it is transmitting on the same spectrum.\nHowever, as wireless signals attenuate quickly over distance,\nthe signal from the SU's local transmit antenna is hundreds\nof thousands of times stronger than the signal received from\nthe PU. Therefore, in general SUs cannot decode a received\nsignal while they are transmitting simultaneously.\nSince the node knows the local transmit signal, it can\nsubtract the local transmit signal from the receive antenna's\nsignal. The main problem is how to cancel the local transmit\nsignal (self-interference) signal. We propose to employ the\nAC, the RIC, and the DIC techniques in CRNs [9]. These\ntechniques enable the SUs to work in the wireless full duplex\nfashion.\nAssuming every PU and SU has N packets to transmit, the\npacket length is denoted by Lp , and the channel data rate is\ndenoted by R. We also assume that once the PU wants to\naccess the channel again, it can tolerate a delay for a period\nless than D. If the delay is larger than D, the packets of\nPU will be dropped due to quality of service (QoS) [13]\u2013[18]\nrequirement.\nIn ideal wireless full duplex CRNs, we do not consider the\nmissed detection (SUs fail to detect the activation of PU) and\nthe imperfect of full duplex. This implies that the packet loss\nrate of PUs is zero. We denote NSU as the number of packets\nsuccessfully transmitted by the SUs during the time denoted\nby Tw . Therefore, during the time Tw , the packet loss rate of\nPUs in half duplex CRNs, denoted by LP U , can be written as\n\n\f3\n\nfollows:\nNSU\nLP U =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nq=1\n\nq\n\nt)\nq (\u03bbp\u03b4\ne\u2212\u03bbp\u03b4t\nq!\n\nN \u03bbp Tw\n\n\u0015\n\n=\n\nNSU \u03b4t\n,\nN Tw\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4t is equal to (N Lp /R) \u2212 D. Eq. (1) implies that if\nany PU is active after a SU's transmission starting time, but\nnot later than \u03b4t from the SU's transmission starting time, the\npackets of the PU will be dropped.\nIn practice, it is impossible for the SUs to sense the\npresence of the PUs without any error. Several signal detection\ntechniques can be used for spectrum sensing, such as the\nenergy detection, feature detection, and matched filter, for the\nSUs to detect the presence of the PUs [19]. We focus on the\nenergy detection approach in this paper because the energy\ndetection approach is efficient and simple to be implemented\nin hardware, and more importantly, it does not require the\nknowledge of signal features of the PUs, which typically may\nnot be known to the SUs.\nTaking the imperfect spectrum sensing into consideration,\nthe packet loss rate of PUs in the full duplex CRNs, denoted\nby \u03c1P U , can be written as follows:\n\u03c1P U = pMD ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere pMD is the SUs' missed detection probability. The\npacket loss rate of PUs in half duplex CRNs, denoted by hP U ,\ncan be written as follows:\nhP U\n\n= 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 LP U )(1 \u2212 pMD )\n=\n\nNSU \u03b4t\nN Tw (1\n\n\u2212 pMD ) + pMD .\n\n(3)\n\nWe assume that the data of SUs can tolerate unlimited delay,\nthus NSU can be calculated by N \u03bbsTw . Now, the main\nproblem is how to find the closed-form of pMD . The missed\ndetection probability in imperfect full duplex CRNs can be\nlarger than the missed detection probability in half duplex\nCRNs. We first assume the full duplex is perfect, and then\nconsider the case of imperfect full duplex.\nA. The Perfect Full Duplex CRN\nTo obtain the closed-form expression of pMD , we need to\nanalyze the received signal at the receive antenna. After the\nAC, the received signal, denoted by r(t), can be written as\nfollows:\nr(t) =hs(t) + \u03c9(t) + \u03ba(t),\n(4)\nwhere h is the instantaneous amplitude gain of the channel\nbetween the SU and the PU, which follows Rayleigh distribution, s(t) is the PU's sent signal with transmit power Es ,\n\u03c9(t) represents the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nwith zero mean and variance of \u03c3 2 , and \u03ba(t) denotes the selfinterference.\nThen, by using the RIC and the DIC, we can obtain\nadditional SNR gains about 10dB and 20dB, respectively. In\nthis paper, we mainly focus on the impact of using wireless full\nduplex in CRNs. Hence, we mainly analyze the effect of using\nthe AC in CRNs, while assuming the SNR gains of the RIC\nand the DIC are ideal values as 10dB and 20dB, respectively.\n\nIn the wireless full duplex CRNs, using the AC technique,\nwe can derive the self-interference as follows:\n\u0001\n\u03ba(t) = Aant ej(2\u03c0fc t+\u03c61 ) + Aant + \u01ebA\nant\n*e\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\u01ebd\nj 2\u03c0fc t+\u03c61 +\u03c0+ \u03bbant\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Aant is the amplitude of signal at the receive antenna\nreceived from a single transmit antenna, \u03c61 is the signal phase\nshift from transmit antenna to receive antenna, \u01ebA\nant represents\nthe amplitude difference between the received signals from the\ntwo transmit antennas at the receive antenna, fc denotes the\ncarrier frequency, \u01ebdant is the phase error caused by receive\nantenna placement compared to the ideal case where the\nsignals from the two antennas arrive with \u03c0 out of phase of\neach other, and \u03bb denotes the wavelength related to the carrier\nfrequency.\nSubstituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (4), we get\nr(t)\n\n= hs(t) + \u03c9(t) + Aant ej(2\u03c0fc t+\u03c61 )\n+ Aant +\n\n\u01ebA\nant\n\n\u0001\n\ne\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\u01ebd\nj 2\u03c0fc t+\u03c61 +\u03c0+ \u03bbant\n\n. (6)\n\nThus the objective of spectrum sensing is to decide between\nthe following two hypotheses (H1 , H0 ) as shown in Eq.

Fig. 4 shows that the\nPUs' packet loss rate versus mean SNR in perfect full duplex\nCRNs and imperfect full duplex CRNs, respectively. In the\nimperfect full duplex CRNs, we set \u01ebdant = 1mm, 2mm, \u01ebA\nant =\n0.1Aant , 0.2Aant , and 20MHz, 85MHz bandwidth centered\nat 2.48GHz, respectively. From Fig. 4, we can observe that\nimperfect full duplex due to the three factors will increase\nthe PUs' packet loss rate. The effect of using wide bandwidth\nhas small effect on the PUs' packet loss rate. The receive\nplacement error and the transmit signals' amplitude difference\nincrease the PUs' packet loss rate slightly. Eliminating the\neffects of these factors as much as possible will enable the\nPUs' packet loss rate of the imperfect full duplex CRNs to\napproach that in perfect full duplex CRNs.\n0.9\nFull Duplex\nHalf Duplex \u03bb =\u03bb =2,D=1/2\np\np\np\n\ns\ns\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nAverage SNR (dB)\n\nFig. 3.

Every active PU or SU has N\npackets to send with N = 100 and Lp = 1KByte. Suppose\nthat D is set to be N Lp /(2R) and N Lp /(4R), respectively,\n\u03bbp and \u03bbs are set to be 2s\u22121 and 5s\u22121 , respectively, and m\nis set to be 5. Fig. 3 shows the PUs packet loss rate versus\nmean SNR in half duplex CRNs and the perfect full duplex\nCRNs, respectively. From Fig. 3, we can observe that the PU's\npacket loss rate in full duplex CRNs is lower than that in half\nduplex CRNs. The PUs' packet loss rate in full duplex CRNs\nconverges to zero when the mean SNR increases. We can also\nfind that the PUs' packet loss also increases when the arrived\nrate \u03bbp and \u03bbs increases. The packet loss rates in the cases\nof \u03bbp = \u03bbs = 5, D = 1/2 and \u03bbp = \u03bbs = 5, D = 1/4 are\nhigher than our theoretical analyses. This is because in these\ncases, the channel approaches the full utilization, causing some\npackets of PUs dropped. Besides, Fig. 3 also shows that when\nthe delay bound increases, the PUs' packet loss rate decreases.\nFor imperfect full duplex CRNs, we assume the power of the\nsignal received from the local transmit antenna is -40dBmW,\nthe signal received from the other node is -70dBmW, and the\naverage power of noise floor is -100dBmW. We consider the\neffect of receive antenna placement error, amplitude difference\n\ns\n\nHalf Duplex \u03bb =\u03bb =5,D=1/4\n\n0.7\n\n(24)\n\nIV.

The PUs Packet Loss Rate in perfect full duplex CRNs and imperfect\nfull duplex CRNs.\n\n\f6\n\nFrom Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we can observe that using full\nduplex in CRNs can effectively decrease the PUs' packet loss\nrate. But a number of factors will impose the full duplex\nimperfectness, which causes the PUs' packet loss rate in the\nfull duplex CNRs higher than that in the half duplex CRNs\nwhen the mean SNR is low. When the mean SNR is high,\neven the imperfect full duplex has smaller PUs' packet loss\nrate than that in wireless half duplex CRNs.\nV. C ONCLUSIONS\nWe proposed and analyzed the full duplex wireless communication schemes for CNRs by combining the Antenna\nCancellation, the RF Interference Cancellation, and the Digital\nInterference Cancellation techniques for SUs. Compared with\nusing the half duplex CRNs, the SUs can identify the PUs'\npresence when they are transmitting by using our proposed\nfull duplex CRNs. We used the PUs' packet loss rate to\nshow the advantage of our proposed full duplex over the half\nduplex in CRNs. We also analyzed the imperfect full duplex in\nCRNs. Although a number of factors may cause the full duplex\nimperfect, in high SNR region, the imperfect full duplex has\nlower PUs' packet loss rate than that in the half duplex CNRs.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] FCC,\n\"Et\ndocket\nno.\n03-237,\"\nhttp://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs public/attachmatch/FCC-03-289A1.pdf,\nNov. 2003.\n[2] H.
