Cryogenic deposition (18\nK) of Au decreases the mobility and shifts the Dirac point in a manner that is consistent\nwith scattering from point-like charged impurities.

It is also of a high conceptual\ninterest, since transport properties of chiral massless fermions are essentially different\nfrom those of conventional charge carriers in metals and semiconductors.3, 4 Currently,\ntypical mobilities are far below the mobility of electrons in graphite and it is generally\nassumed that extrinsic effects are the cause of this suppression. Charged impurity\nscattering has received the most attention,5-9 with the majority of studies modeling the\nimpurities as point-like objects (1/r potential). Recently, theoretical studies considered the\nphysical structure of the charged impurities and found that clusterization of charged\nimpurities can be one of the most important factors influencing their scattering\nproperties.10\nIn this study, we utilize in situ transport measurements to investigate the relationship\nbetween the clusterization of charged impurities and the electronic transport in graphene.\nIn ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), we deposit gold impurities onto the surface of graphene\ndevices at cryogenic temperatures, which generates n-type doping and decreases the\nmobility in a manner consistent with scattering from point-like charged impurities. As the\nsample temperature is gradually increased up to room temperature, the increased thermal\nenergy promotes clusterization of the gold impurities, which leads to an increase of the\nmobility and a decrease of the electronic doping of graphene. The increase in mobility\ndue to cluster formation is consistent with theoretical models10 and illustrates a\nmechanism that plays a role in determining the electrical conductivity of graphene.\n\n2\n\n\fSingle layer graphene is obtained through mechanical exfoliation of Kish graphite\nonto a SiO2/Si(001) substrate (SiO2 thickness of 300 nm). A suitable single layer flake is\nidentified using optical microscopy and verified through Raman spectroscopy.11 Standard\nelectron beam lithography techniques are employed to pattern the sample into a fourpoint probe geometry, with contacting electrodes of Au(100 nm)/Ti(10 nm). Following\nthe completion of all fabrication steps, the graphene device is annealed in an Ar/H\natmosphere at 200oC to remove photoresist and other chemical residues.12, 13 The sample\nis then loaded into a UHV system for degassing at 90oC. Gold impurities are deposited on\nthe graphene surface using a thermal molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) source while the\nsample temperature is controlled by a variable temperature flow cryostat. Specially\ndesigned electrical probes for transport measurements allow all metal deposition and\ntransport measurements to be performed in the same UHV chamber without transferring\nor changing the sample position throughout the course of the study.\nBoth graphene and graphite are known to have high surface diffusions, promoting the\nclustering of materials when deposited at room temperature. Theoretical calculations of\nadsorption and diffusion energies suggest the deposition of gold onto a graphene surface\nat cryogenic temperatures will suppress the motion of the gold, minimizing the formation\nof clusters.14-19 In this study, the graphene device is cooled to 18 K in UHV prior to\nmeasuring the gate dependent conductivity of the clean sample. Gold is then deposited at\na rate of 5.0\u00d71011 atoms/(cm2 sec) in 1 sec intervals for a total of 6 sec while the\ntemperature is held constant at 18 K. The rate of gold deposition is measured using a\nquartz crystal deposition monitor, and pressures remain below 7\u00d710-10 torr. The additional\npresence of gold atoms on the surface is expected to result in charge transfer between\n\n3\n\n\fgold and graphene as well as affect the graphene mobility without resulting in wave\nfunction hybridization.20-22 Following each deposition, the gate dependent conductivity is\nmeasured. The effect of gold deposition on the transport properties is displayed in Figure\n1a. Several trends become apparent as the amount of gold increases. The Dirac point\n(VD) shifts toward more negative voltages, indicating the transfer of electrons from gold\nto graphene. With increased gold concentration, the width of the minimum conductivity\nregion increases and the conductivity curves also become more linear. In addition, the\nslope of the linear portion away from the Dirac point decreases, indicating a decrease in\nelectron and hole mobility, since the mobilities (\u03bce,h) are determined using the relation\n\u03bce,h = |\u0394\u03c3/e\u0394n|,5,\n\n7\n\nwhere the carrier concentration, n, is directly related to the gate\n\nvoltage, Vg, by n=-\u03b1(Vg-VD) with \u03b1=7.2x10 10 V-1cm-2. The average mobility values, \u03bc =\n(\u03bce+ \u03bch)/2, are shown for the clean sample and the 6 gold depositions in Figure 1b and\nexhibit a drastic decrease upon the first deposition of gold, followed by a gradual\ndecrease with additional gold.\nTo determine whether the features described are generated by scattering from pointlike charged impurities5,\n\n7\n\nor clusters,6 it is necessary to investigate the relationship\n\nbetween Dirac point shift (\u0394VD = VD \u2013 VD,initial) and impurity concentration.5, 8 Increasing\nthe impurity concentration (in either adatom or cluster form) will result in more scattering\ncenters and a decreased mobility. The presence of point-like charged impurities affects\nthe mobility through the relationship \u03bcnimp=5\u00d71015 V-1s-1.5, 8 Using this relation and the\nmobility value for the clean graphene, \u03bc0=8390 cm2/Vs, we find an impurity\nconcentration of 6.0\u00d71011 cm-2, similar to values found for other high quality clean\nsamples.23 The quantity 1/\u03bc \u2013 1/\u03bc0 is therefore proportional to the impurity concentration\n\n4\n\n\finduced by gold alone. Using the final mobility value of 1270 cm2/Vs after 6 sec of gold\ndeposition, it is calculated that the gold induces 3.3\u00d71012 cm-2 impurities/cm2, consistent\nwith the value of 3.0\u00d71012 atoms/cm2 calculated from the measured deposition rate of\ngold (previous theoretical work5, 8 and calculations here assume a charge transfer of one\nelectron per impurity adatom). The additional impurities will also result in a shift of the\nDirac point through the power law relationship, -\u0394VD ~ (1/\u03bc \u2013 1/\u03bc0)b, with values of\nb=1.2-1.3 for point-like scattering (1/r Coulomb potential),5,\n\n8\n\nwhile scattering from\n\nclusters of material results in b < 1.0.6 Figure 1c shows the data of Dirac point shift vs.\n1/\u03bc \u2013 1/\u03bc0 as well as the best fit line, having a coefficient b=1.3 (solid line). For\ncomparison, the dashed line represents a power law with b=1. The experimentally\nmeasured coefficient, b, along with the similarity between measured and calculated\nimpurity concentration indicate that gold deposited at low temperature behaves as pointlike charged impurities.\nFollowing the deposition of gold at cryogenic temperatures, the transport properties\nare monitored as the temperature is increased by discrete amounts until reaching room\ntemperature. Figure 2a shows an increase in the mobility as the temperature is increased,\nand Figure 2b shows the corresponding change in the Dirac point. At each temperature\nvalue, the temperature is stabilized and the gate dependent conductivity is measured to\ndetermine the mobility and Dirac point voltage. To test for dynamics, the temperature is\nheld fixed for at least 35 minutes while the transport measurement is repeated every ~8\nminutes. In the range between 18 K and 210 K, we observe no time dependence of the\nmobility or Dirac point. Although, at higher temperatures, the mobility and Dirac point\ndo exhibit a slow dynamics. In Figures 2a and 2b, the multiple data points at 240 K, 270\n\n5\n\n\fK, and near RT (292-298 K) represent the time evolution over 42 minutes, 42 minutes,\nand 600 minutes, respectively. Figures 2c and 2d show the explicit time dependence of\nthe mobility and Dirac point that continues for over 10 hours at RT.\nCompared to the initial mobility value of 1270 cm2/Vs at 18 K, the final room\ntemperature value of 3360 cm2/Vs is nearly three times as large. This change in mobility\nis equivalent to the removal of 2.4\u00d71012 impurities/cm2. The moderate temperatures used\nin this study do not provide nearly enough thermal energy to result in evaporation of the\ngold. Hence, a more plausible explanation for the observed mobility increase involves the\nrearranging of impurities to form clusters. Based on theoretical predictions, for a fixed\namount of impurities, the formation of large circular clusters will decrease the scattering\ncross section compared to that of isolated adatoms,10 which would manifest itself\nexperimentally as an increase in mobility. While the mobility shows a continuous change\nover the measured temperature range, the Dirac point exhibits minimal change between\ntemperature of 75 K and 210 K. This behavior in Dirac point has interesting implications\nfor the doping due to small clusters and will be discussed in more detail later. While\nclean graphene is known to have minimal temperature dependence, the effect of\ntemperature on metal doped graphene samples has not yet been investigated. To rule this\nfactor out as the cause of the drastic change in doping and scattering observed, the sample\nis once again cooled. Figure 2e shows the gate dependent conductivity for (1) the initial\nstate at 18 K immediately following the gold deposition (black curve), (2) after heating to\nroom temperature (red curve), and (3) for the second cool-down to 18 K (blue curve).\nThe minimal change observed between room temperature and 18 K during the second\n\n6\n\n\fcool down, along with the substantial difference between the two curves measured at 18\nK, indicates an irreversible change that is due to cluster formation of the gold impurities.\nThe time dependent properties of the transport measurement provide insight into the\nclusterization dynamics. At the lower temperatures (18 K \u2013 210 K), no dynamics are\nobserved within the resolution of the measurement (~8 min.). In this regime, the cluster\nformation is limited primarily by energetics of surface diffusion (i.e. thermal energy vs.\nenergy barrier heights). The clusterization occurs as the temperature is increased and\nreaches a stable state at fixed temperature within 8 minutes. On the other hand, at higher\ntemperatures (\u2265240 K), the observed dynamics over long time scales implies that issues\nof clusterization dynamics (e.g. probability of cluster collisions, density of clusters, etc.)\nbecome more important than energetics.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) is utilized to characterize the structure of the gold\non the graphene surface. As suggested by the drastic changes in transport measurements,\nthe gold has formed clusters of material, clearly identified in Figure 3a. The boundary\nbetween the substrate and SLG is identified in the figure. There is no preferential\nclusterization at this boundary, contrary to what has been observed at elevated\ntemperatures.16 The circular nature of the clusters allows further comparisons between\nexperimental data and the theoretical predications of Katsnelson et. al.10. By modeling\nthe behavior of charge carriers scattered from a circularly symmetric potential, it is\npredicted that the scattering cross section of a large cluster (kFR>1) is comparable to that\nof a single isolated impurity. Through further analysis of two 1.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.5 \u03bcm area\nscans, the cluster diameter is found to vary from approximately 40 to 120 nm, as seen in\nFigure 3b. From this data, we are also able to estimate a cluster density of 2.4\u00d7109 cm-2.\n\n7\n\n\fAssuming a large cluster will have a similar effect on mobility as a point like scatterer, a\nfinal mobility value on the order of 8300 cm2/Vs is expected (limited by the initial\nmobility of the clean device). While the observed recovery is clearly not this drastic, it is\nevident that the clustering has significantly reduced the scattering compared to the initial\nstate of point like charged impurities. A distinct possibility, to account for the only\nmoderate enhancement of mobility, is that not all the material has formed clusters. Single\natoms or small clusters of several atoms are below the resolution of AFM. These isolated\nimpurities would provide additional scattering sites, preventing the mobility from fully\nrecovering, without being detected during the AFM measurement. In any case, the\nmeasured transport data clearly shows that for the same number of gold atoms, the effect\non mobility is significantly reduced when the impurities are in the form of clusters\ncompared to that of isolated adatoms.\nWhile the mobility changes throughout the measured temperature range, the Dirac\npoint shows little variation at low temperatures (< 210 K) followed by a rapid shift\ntoward more positive values as room temperature is approached. We note that the plateau\nin the Dirac point data (Figure 2b) does not imply that the cluster formation has stopped\nbetween 70 K and 210 K; the increase of the mobility in this temperature range clearly\nindicates that structure of the gold clusters is changing. Rather, the plateau structure is\ndue to a more complicated relation between the electronic doping by clusters and the\nmeasurement of the Dirac point. A qualitative understanding of this behavior may be\nreached by considering the effect of large clusters in comparison to adatoms on the\nsurface of graphene. In the case of adatoms, the graphene system is relatively\nhomogeneous, with the carriers transferred between metal and graphene not localized to\n\n8\n\n\fany particular region. These transferred carriers result in a large shift in the Fermi energy,\nas measured by the Dirac point shift. However, for large clusters, their effect on the\ngraphene is more similar to the effect produced by metallic electrodes.24 In this case, the\ngraphene can no longer be considered a homogeneous system, and is instead separated\ninto three areas. The majority of charge transferred between the metal and graphene is\nconfined to the region directly below an electrode, resulting in a Fermi level that is\npinned and unaffected by the gate voltage. Away from the electrode, the carrier\nconcentration is governed solely by the gate voltage. A third region exists at the edges of\nthe electrodes, where charge diffuses away from the large concentration situated below\nthe electrodes. In this transition region, the carrier concentration is affected by both the\nmetal and the gate voltage. It is the presence of this transition region which results in a\nshift in the Dirac point. While the continually changing mobility in the collected data\nindicates cluster formation throughout the temperature range, the behavior of the Dirac\npoint implies a transition between the adatom-like and electrode-like situations described\nabove. At lower temperatures, small clusters and adatoms are unable confine carriers,\nresulting in a Dirac point that has been shifted greatly in comparison to that of the clean\nsample. Above a certain threshold (T~210 K), the clusters behave similarly to electrodes,\nwith some of the doping electrons confined to the region below the cluster and unaffected\nby gate voltage. As larger clusters continue to form, the number of confined carriers\ncontinues to increase. Under the conditions of fixed amount of gold impurities, this leads\nto a decrease in the number of carriers in the transition regions, causing the Dirac point to\nshift back towards zero. We note that the Dirac point behavior is consistent with previous\nstudies of Pt clusters on graphene, where the Dirac point shifts toward zero at higher\n\n9\n\n\fcoverages. 6 Therefore, in addition to the effects discussed above, the role of cluster size\non the interfacial dipole strength and the equilibrium distance between the metal and\ngraphene may have to be considered. 22, 25\nWhile this provides a qualitative explanation, future experiments may be able to\nprovide more insight into this behavior by combining transport measurements with low\ntemperature growth and atomic resolution scanning probe microscopy.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that gold deposited at low temperature behaves as\npoint-like charged impurities. The shift in Dirac point clearly indicates electrons are\ntransferred from gold to graphene at submonolayer coverages. For a fixed amount of gold\nimpurities, it is discovered that the formation of clusters significantly enhances the\nmobility and causes the Dirac point to shift back toward zero. The latter is attributed to\nthe increased inhomogeneity associated with large clusters, while the former is\nqualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction of reduced scattering by clustered\nimpurities.\nWe acknowledge stimulating discussions with S.-W.

(c) \u2212\u0394VD is plotted vs. 1/\u03bc \u20131/\u03bc0. The solid\nline is the power-law fit to the equation, -\u0394VD ~ (1/\u03bc \u20131/\u03bc0)b, where b=1.3. For\ncomparison the dashed line shows a power law with b=1.\n\nFigure 2: (a) The mobility and (b) Dirac point shift are displayed as a function of\ntemperature. Above 210 K, the mobility and Dirac point change over time at fixed\ntemperature, indicated by the multiple data points at set temperature values. The time\ndependence of mobility (c) and Dirac point (d) are displayed for the sample at room\ntemperature over a span of 10 hours. (e) A comparison of the gate dependent conductivity\ncurves measured immediately after gold deposition at 18 K, upon warming to room\ntemperature, and after the second cool down indicate irreversible cluster formation.\n\nFigure 3: (a) The room temperature AFM scan shows clusters of gold on the surface of\ngraphene. (b) A histogram of cluster sizes measured in two 1.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.5 \u03bcm area scans.\n\n12\n\n\fConductivity (mS)\n\n(a)\n1.5\n\n6 sec\n\n4 sec\n\n2 sec 1 sec\n\nNo Au\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n5\u00d71011\natoms/(cm2s)\n\n18 K\n\n0.0\n\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n\n80\n\n(b)\n-\u0394VD (V)\n\n8000\n\n2\n\n\u03bc (cm /Vs)\n\n-80\n-40\nGate Voltage (V)\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n40\n20\n10\n\n0 2 4 6\nAu Amount (sec)\n\nFigure 1\n\nb=1.3\n\n2 3 4 5 67\n2\n1/\u03bc-1/\u03bc0 (Vs/cm )\n\n\f(b)\n\n-40\n-50\n-60\n\n3450\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300\nTemperature (K)\n(c)\n\n3300\n3150\n\nRT\n0 200 400 600\nTime (min)\n\nConductivity (mS)\n\n2\n\n\u03bc (cm /Vs)\n\n-70\n0\n\n2.0 (e)\nRT\n1.5 18 K\n\nDirac Point (V)\n\n2\n\n\u03bc (cm /Vs)\nDirac Point (V)\n\n3500\n(a)\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n\n-33 (d)\n-36\n-39\n\nRT\n\n-42\n\n0 200 400 600\nTime (min)\n18 K\n2nd Cool down\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n-90 -60 -30\nGate Voltage (V)\n\nFigure 2\n\n0\n\n\fSLG\n\nSiO2\n\nNumber of Clusters\n\n(a)\n\n750 nm\n\n3 (b)\n2\n1\n0\n40\n\n60 80 100 120\nCluster Width (nm)\n\nFigure 3\n\n\f"}
