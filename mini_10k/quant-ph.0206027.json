We illustrate this by considering the case\nof a wave packet which is reflected from the perturbed\nbarrier. Similar analysis can be done for the transmitted\nwave packet.\nLet us first briefly recapitulate the essential features of\nquantum superarrivals. Consider a Gaussian wave packet\npeaked at x0 with half width \u03c3. It moves to the right and\nstrikes a potential barrier of width w centred at a point\nxc . A detector placed at a point x\u2032 far left of x0 measures\nthe time-dependent reflection probability by counting the\nreflected particles arriving there up to various instants for\nboth the case of a static barrier, and also when the barrier is perturbed by reducing its height to zero linearly\nin time. At any instant before the asymptotic value of\nthe reflection probability is attained, the time evolving\nreflection probability in the region \u2212\u221e < x \u2264 x\u2032 is given\nby\nZ x\u2032\n2\n2\n|R(t)| =\n|\u03c8 (x, t)| dx\n(1)\n\nA number of interesting investigations have been reported on wave-packet dynamics [1] including, in particular, recent studies on issues such as the observation of\nrevivals of wave packets [2]. Of late, we had pointed out\na hitherto unexplored effect [3] considering the time dependent reflection probability of a Gaussian wave packet\nreflected from a perturbed potential barrier. By reducing the height of the barrier to zero in a short span of\ntime during which there is a significant overlap of it with\nthe wave packet, we observed that the reflection probability is larger compared to the case of reflection from a\nstatic barrier for a small but finite interval of time. This\nphenomenon is what we have called \"Quantum Superarrivals\". The speed with which the effect due to reducing the barrier height propagates across the wavefunction\nwas noticed to be depending on the rate at which the barrier height is reduced. We also found the magnitude of\nsuperarrivals to be proportional to the rate of reduction\nof the potential barrier. We argued that superarrivals occur because of the \"objective reality\" of a wave function\nacting as a \"field\" which mediates across it the propagation of a physical disturbance, viz. perturbation of the\npotential barrier.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe denote the reflected probability for the static and the\nperturbed cases as Rs (t) and Rp (t) respectively. In [3]\nwe computed these probabilities versus time for various\nvalues of \u01eb which is the time span over which the barrier\nheight goes to zero (implying different rates of reduction\nof the potential barrier). We observed that Rp (t) > Rs (t)\nduring the time interval td < t < tc . If tp is the instant\nat which the perturbation starts, tc the instant when the\nstatic and the perturbed curves cross each other, and td\nthe time from which the curve corresponding to the perturbed case starts deviating from that in the unperturbed\ncase, we found that tc > td > tp .\nLet us now consider the case when initially there is\nno barrier, and the wave packet is allowed to propagate freely towards the right. A second detector placed\n\nThe aim of this paper is to further generalize the phenomenon of superarrivals and also to understand how superarrivals occur. We begin by first showing that superarrivals also indeed occur in the transmission probability\nwhen the barrier height is raised from zero to some value\n(this is complementary to the superarrival phenomenon\noccuring for the reflected wave packet). We then compute particle trajectories using the Bohm model. We\nderive a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of superarrivals using the Bohmian trajectories. We show that it\nis possible to obtain a deeper insight into the nature of\nsuperarrivals using such computed trajectories of individ-\n\n\u2217\n\nmani@bose.res.in\narchan@bose.res.in\n\u2021\ndhom@boseinst.ac.in\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fFIG. 1. The transmission probability |T (t)|2 is plotted for\nvarious values of \u01eb. The top curve reaches value 1 asymptotically and corresponds to the zero barrier case. The next two\ncurves with (\u01eb = 10) and (\u01eb = 40) respectively, represent the\ntransmission probabilities for the rising barriers.\n\nfar away at x\u2032\u2032 records the time-dependent transmission\nprobability Ts (t) (counting the transmitted particles up\nto various instants of time). If a barrier is raised in the\npath of the wave packet, a portion of it will be reflected\nback. We denote by Tp (t) the transmitted probability\nin this case. At any instant before the asymptotic value\nof the transmission probability (= 1 since there is no\nabsorption) is attained, the time evolving transmission\nprobability in the region x\u2032\u2032 \u2264 x \u2264 \u221e is given by\n2\n\n|T (t)| =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nx\u2032\u2032\n\nSuperarrivals can be quantitatively defined by a parameter \u03b7 given by\n\u03b7=\n\n2\n\n|\u03c8 (x, t)| dx\n\n(2)\n\n\u2206t\n\nIs =\n\nve =\n\n(5)\n\nD\ntd \u2212 (tp \u2212 2\u01eb )\n\n(6)\n\nmeasuring how fast the influence of barrier perturbation\ntravels across the wave packet. We found that ve is again\nproportional to \u01eb as was the case with \u03b7. These features\nlead one to argue that the wave packet acts as a carrier\n(objective field-like behaviour) through which information about the barrier perturbation propagates with a\nvelocity that is proportional to the \"disturbance\" (measured in terms of the rate of barrier reduction) imparted\nto the packet by the barrier.\nNow, in order to understand how superarrivals originate, we use the concept of particle trajectories in terms\nof the Bohm model (BM). We recall that BM provides an\nontological and a self-consistent interpretation of the formalism of quantum mechanics [6,7]. Predictions of BM\nare in agreement with that of standard quantum mechanics. In BM a wave function \u03c8 is taken to be an incomplete\nspecification of the state of an individual particle. An objectively real \"position\" coordinate (\"position\" existing\n\n0.8\n\n|T(t)|^2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n1000\n\n|Rs (t)|2 dt\n\nReplacing the static and perturbed reflected probabilities\nby Ts (t) and Tp (t) respectively, one can obtain the corresponding expression of \u03b7 for the case of the transmitted\nwave packet.\nIt has been observed [3] that both \u2206t and superarrivals given by \u03b7 depend on the instant tp around which\nthe barrier is perturbed. The magnitude of superarrivals\nis appreciable only in cases where the wave packet has\nsome significant overlap with the barrier while it is being\nperturbed. The magnitude of superarrivals falls off with\nincreasing \u01eb, for the reflected as well as the transmitted\nwave packets. Another interesting observation is about\ninformation transfer from the perturbing barrier to the\ndetector. We defined signal velocity\n\n1\n\n500\n\nZ\n\n\u2206t\n\nThe potential barrier is raised from V = 0 to V = 2E\n(where E is the energy of the incident wave packet) linearly in time \u01eb. In Figure 1 we plot the computed values\nof Ts (t) and Tp (t) for different values of \u01eb. The numbers\ndenoting various instants of time in this as well as the\nsubsequent figures are in units of the time steps used in\nthe numerical algorithm. For example, t = 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 corresponds to 400 time steps. It is seen that superarrivals\nare also exhibited in the transmitted wave packet.\n\n0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the quantities Ip and Is are defined with respect\nto \u2206t = tc \u2212 td during which superarrivals occur. For the\ncase of superarrivals in the reflected probability,\nZ\n|Rp (t)|2 dt\n(4)\nIp =\n\nWe compute the values of Ts (t) and Tp (t) using the same\nmethod of numerically integrating the time dependent\nSchrodinger equation as used in [3], which was first developed in [4]. The following values for the parameters\nare chosen for our computations \u221a\n(in units of h\u0304 = 1 and\nm = 1/2): x0 = \u22120.3, \u03c3 = 0.05/ 2, xc = 0, w = 0.016,\nx\u2032 = \u22120.5, x\u2032\u2032 = 0.5 and tp = 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 . It should be\nemphasized that the observation of the phenomenon of\nsuperarrivals does not hinge upon the choice of these particular values of the parameters. Indeed, the quantitative\ndependence of superarrivals on the parameter values have\nbeen studied in [3] where it was shown that superarrivals\nin reflection persist for a sufficiently wide range of values\nof these parameters. We choose one particular set of values for the computations used in this paper since our aim\nhere is primarily to investigate the origin of superarrivals.\n\n0\n\nIp \u2212 Is\nIs\n\n1500\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\fd\n~ \u0307 = \u2212\u2207(V\n~\n(mX)\n+ Q)|X\ndt\n\nirrespective of any external observation) is ascribed to\na particle apart from the wave function.

The effective potential on the particle is\ncal force \u2212\u2207V\n(Q + V ). We plot the profile of Q versus x at various instants of time near the potential barrier (when its height\nis reduced) in Figure 2. It is then transparent how the\nperturbation of the classical potential V affects Q away\nfrom the vicinity of the boundary of V . This in turn accounts for the sharp turn experienced by those particles\nwhich contribute towards superarrivals (as we shall see\nexplicitly later).\n\n(7)\n\nby writing\n\u03c8 = ReiS/h\u0304\n\n(8)\n\nand using the continuity equation\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c1\n(\u03c1v) +\n=0\n\u2202x\n\u2202t\n\n(15)\n\n(9)\n\nwith the probability distribution \u03c1(x, t) being given by\n0\n\n\u03c1 = |\u03c8|2 .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is important to note that \u03c1 in BM is ascribed an ontological significance by regarding it as representing the\nprobability density of \"particles\" occupying actual positions and the velocity v is interpreted as an ontological\n(premeasurement) velocity. On the other hand, in the\nstandard interpretation, \u03c1 is interpreted as the probability density of finding particles around specific positions\nand there is no concept of an ontological velocity. Integrating Eq.(9) by using Eqs.(7), (8) and (10) and requiring that v should vanish when \u03c1 vanishes leads to the\nBohmian equation of motion where the particle velocity\nv(x, t) is given by\nv\u2261\n\n1 \u2202S\ndx\n=\ndt\nm \u2202x\n\nQ(x,t)\n\n\u22122e+05\n\n\u22124e+05\n\n\u22126e+05\n\u22120.06\n\nFIG. 2. Snapshots of the quantum potential Q(x, t) are\nplotted versus x at various instants of time. The potential\nbarrier is located in the region \u22120.008 < x < 0.008. Barrier\nperturbation is from t = 400 to t = 410. The full, dashed and\ndotted curves represent Q at times t = 420, 425 and 430 respectively. The wells in the quantum potential move towards\nthe left with time and reflect incoming particles away from\nthe vicinity of the classical barrier. This explains why certain\nparticles arrive at the detector earlier than they would have\ndone if reflected from a static barrier.\n\n(11)\n\nWe compute the Bohmian trajectories for a given set\nof initial positions with a Gaussian distribution corresponding to the initial wave packet. This procedure is\ncarried out for both the cases of lowering and raising the\nbarrier. Since our purpose is to obtain conceptual clarity\nof the phenomenon of superarrivals, it suffices to illustrate our scheme through the example of superarrivals\nin the reflection probability when the barrier is reduced.\nAll the qualitative as well as quantitative features of superarrivals are similar in the case where one observes\nthe transmitted probabilty from a rising barrier. Thus,\nhenceforth we consider only the former case in the following discussion.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nand by indentifying\nQ(x, t) = \u2212\n\nh\u03042 \u22072 R\n2m R\n\n\u22120.02\nx\n\nThe particle trajectory is thus deterministic and is obtained by integrating the velocity equation for a given\ninitial position.\nAnother perspective on the notion of particle trajectories in BM is obtained by decomposing the Schrodinger\nequation in terms of two real equations for the modulus\nR and the phase S of the wave function \u03c8 [6]\n~ 2\n\u2202S\n(\u2207S)\nh\u03042 \u22072 R\n+\n\u2212\n+V =0\n\u2202t\n2m\n2m R\n\u0012 ~ \u0013\n\u2202R2 ~ R2 \u2207S\n=0\n+ \u2207.\n\u2202t\nm\n\n\u22120.04\n\n(14)\n\nas the \"quantum potential\" [6]. The equation of motion\nof a particle along its trajectory can now be written in a\nform analogous to Newton's second law\n3\n\n\fThe following approach is used to study superarrivals\nin terms of the Bohmian trajectories. First, a particular\nvalue of the barrier reduction rate, or \u01eb is chosen. We\nthen choose a range of initial positions for which the trajectory arrival times at the detector lie between td and\ntc (i.e., we select only those trajectories which contribute\nto superarrivals). We consider N such trajectories whose\ninitial positions form a Gaussian distribution. Let us denote one such trajectory by Sip having the initial position\nxi and the arrival time tip . Taking the static case, the\ntrajectory Si for that initial position xi is computed. Let\nthe corresponding arrival time be ti . A supearrival parameter \u03b2i for the i-th Bohmian trajectory is then defined\nas\nti \u2212 tip\n\u03b2i =\nti\n\nX(t)\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\nt\n\n(16)\n\nFIG. 3. Bohmian trajectories for particles originating from\nthe same initial positions get reflected differently from the\nstatic and the perturbed barriers. The trajectories undergo\nsharper turns when the barrier is perturbed and arrive the the\ndetector earlier than they would have done for the static barrier case. The barrier is placed at x = \u22120.008 to x = 0.008.\nPerturbation takes place from t = 400 to t = 410.\n\nwhich provides a measure of superarrivals for a particular\nvalue of initial position. Next we define an average value\nP\n\u03b2i\n\u03b2\u0303 = i\n(17)\nN\nwhich provides a quantitative estimate of superarrivals\nobtained through Bohmian trajectories.\nOur results show that the arrival time1 tip for the perturbed case is sensitive to the value of initial position xi .\nWe have checked that for a particular initial position, ti\nexceeds tip for only those trajectories which contribute to\nsuperarrivals. This is a distinct feature associated with\nthe superarrivals that can be identified in terms of the\nBohmian trajectories. We plot a set of Bohmian trajectories in Figure 3. Note that the trajectories of the particles corresponding to the perturbed case take a sharp\nturn and arrive at the detector earlier than they would\nhave for a static barrier. Any abrupt perturbation of\nthe potential barrier has thus a global effect on the wave\nfunction and affects the values of the quantum potential\nQ(x, t) at various points. Then, through the Bohmian\nequation of motion the velocities of the incident particles get correspondingly affected much before reaching\nthe vicinity of the potential barrier. Superarrivals originate from those particles in the perturbed case which\nreach the detector earlier than those corresponding to the\nsame initial positions in the static case. This accounts\nfor why a detector records more counts in the perturbed\ncase during a particular time interval as compared to\nthat in a static situation. The origin of superarrivals can\nthus be understood in this way by using the Bohmian\ntrajectories.\n\nThe effect of altering the barrier perturbation time \u01eb on\nthe magnitude of superarrivals \u03b2\u0303 can be studied by computing \u03b2\u0303 for various values of \u01eb. We display the results of\nthis study in Figure 4. Note that the the magnitude of\nsuperarrivals decreases monotonically with increasing \u01eb,\nor decreasing rate of perturbation. This effect was also\nobserved in [3] where we obtained a similar behaviour\nfor the superarrival parameter \u03b7. The similarity of these\ntwo results obtained through entirely different techniques\nreinforces our contention about the dynamical nature of\nsuperarrivals originating from a \"disturbance\" provided\nby the lowering of potential barrier, which propagates\nacross the wave function with a definite speed.\n\n1\n\nFor conceptual subtleties concerning arrival time in the\nBohm model, and, in general, its definition in quantum theory, see [8].\n\n4\n\n\fD.

The Bohmian superarrival parameter \u03b2\u0303 is plotted\nversus \u01eb.\n\nTo conclude, in this paper we have explored further\nthe nature and origin of quantum superarrivals manifested in terms of enhanced reflection and transmission\nprobabilities of wave packets from a perturbed potential\nbarrier which is respectively lowered or raised. We have\nshown how the concept of particle trajectories obtained\nfrom the Bohm model enables one to have an insight into\nthe phenomenon of quantum superarrivals. This analysis\nsubstantiates our earlier contention [3] that superarrivals\narise from a dynamical disturbance provided by the perturbed barrier which propagates across the wave packet\n(which acts like a \"physically real field\") with a definite\nspeed and affects the \"particles\". Such time dependent\nquantum phenomena could be useful in furnishing examples of the conceptual utility of the Bohm model from\na perspective different from other examples studied recently [9] for this purpose.\n\n5\n\n\f"}
