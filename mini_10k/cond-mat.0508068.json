However, ultracold atoms in optical lattices\noffer much better control over microscopic parameters of\nthe model. Consequently, it is possible to explore parameter regimes which are not available in other analogous\ncondensed matter systems.\nRecently, experiments involving internal states of these\natoms have been carried out4,5 . In particular, in Ref. 4,\nthe two hyperfine states (|F = 2, mF = \u22122i \u2261 |1i and\n|F = 1, mF = \u22121i \u2261 |2i) of 87 Rb atoms have been used\nto create entangled states between atoms in different\nwells of the optical lattice. In these experiments, a \u03c0/2\npulse is applied to bosons originally in one of the two\nhyperfine states\u221a(say |1i), leaving them in eigenstates of\n\u03c3x ([|1i + |2i]/ 2), where the \u03c3 denote Pauli matrices\ncorresponding to the two hyperfine states.\nTo envisage how such experimental systems are relevant for realization of a two species Bose-Hubbard model,\nconsider an optical lattice created using elliptically polarized light with polarization angle \u03b8. Since the spin states\nwith ms = \u00b11/2 see potentials V\u00b1 = V0 sin2 (kx \u00b1 \u03b8), the\nhyperfine states |1i and |2i experience potentials V1(2)\ngiven by (see Refs. 4,6,7 for details)\nV1 = V0 sin2 (kx + \u03b8)\n\u0001\nV0\nsin2 (kx + \u03b8) + 3 sin2 (kx \u2212 \u03b8) .\nV2 =\n4\n\n(1)\n\nConsequently, a change in the polarization angle \u03b8 is\nequivalent to a relative shift of the lattices with respect\n\nto each other. Since the interaction between the bosons\nis short-ranged, such a shift can be used to control the\ninter-species interaction U \u2032 . Note that changing the polarization angle also changes the depth of V2 , and therefore the corresponding hopping amplitude t2 . Hence, systems of atoms where state selective optical potentials can\nbe implemented may provide ideal test beds for studying properties of the two species bosonic Hubbard model\nwith variable hopping amplitudes and interspecies interaction strength.\nSeveral theoretical works have discussed realizations\nof novel phases in the two-species system in an optical\nlattice8,9,10,11 . Because of the inter-species interaction,\nthe Mott phase is divided into regions with different long\nrange orders. These phases can be described in terms of\nisospin, a quantum number which describes the occupation state of a single site by two components8,9,10 . For\na total occupation 2n0 \u2212 1, the states |n0 , n0 \u2212 1i and\n|n0 \u2212 1, n0 i correspond to isospin states with Sz = 1/2\nand Sz = \u22121/2 respectively. However, at the superfluid\ntransition point, which can be approached by decreasing\nthe strength of the optical lattice, the isospin description\nbreaks down because of strong density fluctuations. The\nisospin quantum number Sz , which is given by the difference in quantized occupation numbers of the two boson\nspecies, becomes ill-defined at this point. Nevertheless,\none can still investigate the effect of such isospin order in\nthe Mott state on the superfluid-insulator (SI) transition.\nThis is the key issue that we are going to address in this\nwork. We note that although there have also been earlier\nstudies of the SI transitions from such isospin symmetry\nbroken Mott states8,11 , the phase diagram of the system\nfor the entire parameter range has, to the best of our\nknowledge, not been charted out and large parts remain\nto be explored.\nKeeping the above-mentioned experimental and theoretical scenarios in mind, we shall study a two-species\n\n\f2\nbosonic Hubbard model described by the Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian8,9,10\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u0011\nX X\u0010\nX\n\u2020\n\uf8f0\nni\u03b1 \uf8fb\nH =\n\u2212t\u03b1 bi\u03b1 bj\u03b1 + h.c \u2212 \u03bc\nhiji\n\n3\n\ni\n\n#\n\"\nX\nU X\nni1 ni2 ,\nni\u03b1 (ni\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 2\u03bb\n+\n2 i\u03b1\ni\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, 2 is the species index, t1(2) denote hopping\namplitudes for the two species between nearest neighbor\nsites hiji, the matrix element U denotes on-site intraspecies Hubbard interaction, U \u2032 = \u03bbU is the inter-species\ninteraction and we have taken the chemical potential \u03bc to\nbe the same for both the species. Note that a change in\noptical lattice depth by tuning the laser polarization also\nleads to a relative shift of chemical potential of the two\nspecies. However this shift is usually small and can always be compensated by applying an external magnetic\nfield since the two species have different magnetic moments. For future convenience, we introduce the ratio\n\u03b7 = t2 /t1 and shall take t2 \u2264 t1 (\u03b7 \u2264 1). Our aim is to\nstudy the different phases of the system as a function of\n\u03bc, \u03bb, t1 and \u03b7 for odd total filling factor. Also, we shall\nrefer to the species index \u03b1 as the isospin label for the\nbosons with isospin S = 1/2.\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, we summarize\nthe key results of this work. First, we find that the\nsuperfluid-insulator transition in systems described by\nEq. 2 can take place with a) simultaneous onset of superfludity of species 1 and 2 (SF-SF phase) or b) coexistence of Mott insulating phase of species 2 and superfluid phase of species 1 (MI2 + SF1 phase) or c), in the\ncase of a unit filling Mott state, depopulation of species\n2 (a-SF phase). Second, for a large region of the phase\ndiagram the superfluid-insulator transition occurs with a\ndiscontinuous jump in the number of each species and is\ntherefore first order. Third, there is a second order quantum phase transition between the a-SF and the SF-SF\nsuperfluid phases which can be viewed as a n0 = 0 Mott\ninsulator-superfluid transition for the bosons of species\n2. Finally our analysis explicitly demonstrates the necessity of including effects of O(t2 /U 2 ) quantum fluctuations (beyond the O(t/U ) mean-field theory) for a correct quantitative description of the phase diagram and\nthe nature of the phase transitions in the system.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. To put this\nwork in perspective, we review the results on the Mott\nphases of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) in Sec. II. In section III, we study the SI transition using O(t/U ) meanfield theory and also discuss the shortcomings of such a\ntheory in the present case. This is followed by Sec. IV,\nwhere we implement a canonical transformation method\nwhich takes into account the effect of quantum fluctuation to O(t2 /U 2 ) on the transition and present a detailed\nphase diagram of the model. This is supplemented by\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations in Section V.

This is followed by a summary of\nour results in Section VII.\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF MOTT PHASES\n\nIn this section, we review the Mott phases of the two\nspecies Bose-Hubbard model8,9,10 . Deep inside the Mott\nphase, for t1 = t2 = 0, the Hubbard Hamiltonian (Eq. 2)\nreduces to sum of on-site terms Hi given by\n\"\n#\nX\nU X\nHi = \u2212\u03bc\nni\u03b1 +\nni\u03b1 (ni\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 2\u03bbni1 ni2 .\n2 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n(3)\n\nThe phases of Hi are characterized by the ground state\nof the system having an integer number of bosons\nn1,2 (\u03bc/U, \u03bb) per site. The phase diagram is shown in\nFig. 1. Apart from the usual even filling phases where\nn1 = n2 , phases with odd filling n1 \u2212 n2 = \u00b11, which has\nno counterpart in single species systems, occur. For the\nrest of this paper, we shall concentrate on phases with\nodd total filling, where each site is doubly degenerate\n(n1 \u2212 n2 = \u00b11) leading to 2N degenerate ground states\nfor a system with N sites for t1 = t2 = 0.\nAt finite hopping strengths, this degeneracy is lifted\nby quantum fluctuations which can be studied by second order perturbation theory. More precisely, one\ncan carry out this perturbation theory in the regime\nU, U \u2032 , |U \u2212 U \u2032 | >> t1 , t2 where we are far away from\nboth the SU(2) symmetric limit (\u03bb = 1) and the vanishing inter-species interaction limit (\u03bb \u226a 1). In both these\nlimits perturbation theory breaks down.\n\n\f3\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\nFM\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nXY\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\nAF\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Mean-field phase diagram of the effective low energy Hamiltonian in Eq. 4 obtained using perturbation theory at odd filling for n0 = 1. The phase diagrams\nfor other values of odd n0 are qualitatively similar in the Mott\ninsulating regime.\n\nTo compute the fluctuation correction for a Mott state\nwith an odd number n0 of atoms on each site, we divide\nthe system into A and B sublattices (to allow for the\npossibility of an antiferromagnetic phase) and use a trial\nwave-function\nYY\n|\u03a8i =\n|\u03c8A ii |\u03c8B ij\n\nferromagnetic (FM) phase with \u03b8A = \u03b8B = 0, and c) XY\nphases with \u03b8A = \u03b8B 6= 0. The nature of the transitions\nbetween these effective isospin phases can be understood\nby plotting the values of the angles \u03b8A and \u03b8B across the\ndifferent phase boundaries. These plots are shown in Fig.\n3. Here the angles \u03b8A and \u03b8B have been plotted for three\ndifferent values of \u03b7. In the XY and FM phases \u03b8A = \u03b8B\nand the lines are indistinguishable, whereas in the AF\nphase one phase takes on a value \u03c0 and the other 0. We\nfind that there is always an abrupt jump from the XY\nto the AF phase across the AF phase boundary, suggesting that AF-XY transition is first order. We do not find\nany canted AF phases. The situation here is analogous\nto the first order melting transition of hard-core bosons\nwith next nearest-neighbor interaction at half filling14 .\nThe FM-XY transition, on the other hand, is continuous\nand proceeds via continuous change of \u03b8A and \u03b8B .\nThe phase diagram obtained here agrees qualitatively\nwith that of Ref. 9, although there is a quantitative difference. In our phase diagram, the tricritical point where\nall the phases meet is at \u03bb = 0.25, \u03b7 = 0 instead of \u03bb =\n0.5, \u03b7 = 0, as found in Ref. 9. To understand why this difference arises, we now map the boson Hamiltonian to an\neffective low-energy spin-model. Defining the isospin operators Siz = (n1i \u2212 n2i )/2, Six = (b\u20201i b2i + b\u20202i b1i )/2 and\nSiy = i(b\u20201i b2i \u2212 b\u20202i b2i )/2 one obtains an effective XXZ\nmodel in a magnetic field8,9\ni\nXh\n\u0001\nJ\u22a5 Six Sjx + Siy Sjy + Jz Siz Sjz\nHXXZ = \u2212\nhiji\n\n\u2212B\n\ni\u2208A j\u2208B\n\nwhere\n\u03b8A,B\n\u03b8A,B\n|n0 , n0 \u2212 1i+ei\u03c6A,B sin\n|n0 \u2212 1, n0 i\n|\u03c8A,B i = cos\n2\n2\nwhere |n1 , n2 ii denotes n1 and n2 atoms of species 1 and 2\nat site i.

We shall work in the parameter regime where\nU, U \u2032 , |U \u2212 U \u2032 | \u226b t1 , t2 . For the sake of clarity, although\nwe shall qualitatively comment on the general case, all\ncalculations in this section from here on shall be performed for two spatial dimensions and n0 = 1.\nBefore carrying out the mean-field analysis, we review\nearlier studies of SI transition for the two species BoseHubbard model (Eq. 2). In Ref. 11, the SI transition\nhas been studied for the case t1 = t2 but with different\ninter-species and intra-species interaction strengths and\nchemical potentials. This has been done using a standard\n\nmean-field theory3 corresponding to decoupling the hopping between sites by introducing order parameter fields\n\u2206\u03b1 , i.e. b\u2020i\u03b1 bj\u03b1 \u2248 b\u2020i\u03b1 \u2206\u03b1 + bj\u03b1 \u2206\u2217\u03b1 \u2212 |\u2206\u03b1 |2 where the fields\n\u2206\u03b1 satisfy the self consistency relations \u2206\u03b1 = hb\u03b1 i. Their\nanalysis led to the prediction of three different phases\n(1) Both species superfluid (SF-SF). (2) Species 1 superfluid and species 2 in a Mott state (SF-MI). (3) Species\n2 superfluid and species 1 in a Mott state. (MI-SF). It\nhas been found (erroneously, as we shall see) in Ref. 11\nthat the Mott states are always destabilized by MI-SF or\nSF-MI phases and there is no direct transition from the\nMott to the SF-SF phase. The transitions are concluded\nto be second order as in the standard single species BoseHubbard model3 . The question of the interplay between\nthe exchange effects and the SI transition in the region of\nsmall \u03bb was studied by Demler et al.8 for unit filling factor and fixed chemical potential \u03bc/U = 12 \u03bb. Apart from\nthe phases mentioned above they also found a superfluid\nphase with species one superfluid and depopulation of\nspecies 2.\nIn our proposed setup, \u03bb is not necessarily small and\nthe SI transition in this regime has not previously been\ninvestigated. To analyze the SI transition to O(t/U )\nwithin mean field it suffices to consider an on-site trial\nwavefunction15\n|\u03a8v i =\n\nY\ni\n\nu0 |1, 0ii + r |0, 1ii + p1 |2, 0ii\n\n+p2 |1, 1ii + p3 |0, 2ii + h1 |0, 0ii\n\n!\n\n(7)\n\nwhere u0 is the amplitude of the ferromagnetic Mott state\n|1, 0i in \u03a8v , h and p are amplitudes of removing, adding\nbosons of species 1, 2 to the Mott state and r is the amplitude of isospin-flip. We note here that allowing the\nisospin-flip process in the trial wavefunction (Eq. 7) is\nabsolutely crucial for correctly taking into account the\nmanifold of low energy boson states which are degenerate to O(t/U ). The normalization of the wave-function\nyields the constraint u20 + r2 + p21 + p22 + p23 + h21 = 1. This\nwavefunction, as we shall see, is appropriate for studying\nthe SI transition from the FM and the XY Mott phases.\nWe shall comment about the AFM-SI transition later.\nThe energy of the variational ground state\nEv (u0 , r, p1 , h1 , p2 , h2 ) = h\u03a8v | H |\u03a8v i is given by\n\"\nEv = EMott + (p21 + p23 )\u03b4E1+ + p22 \u03b4E2+ + h21 \u03b4E1\u2212\n#\nX \u22062\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n,\nzt\u03b1\n\u03b1=1,2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere EMott is the energy of the Mott state, z is the\ncoordination number of the lattice, \u03b4E\u03b1\u00b1 denote the energies of adding/removing a boson of species \u03b1 to/from\nthe Mott state given by\n\u03b4E1+ = \u2212\u03bc + U,\n\n\u03b4E2+ = \u2212\u03bc + \u03bbU\n\n\u03b4E1\u2212 = \u03bc, (9)\n\n\f5\nh1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6= 0\n6= 0\n\n0.025\n\n0.020\n\n1.0\n\n0.015\n\n0.5\n\nB\n\nA\n\n2\n\n0.010\n\nc\n\nTABLE I: Parameter values of the variational wavefunction\ncorresponding to the different phases.\n\n1\n\np3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6= 0\n\nn (t )\n\np2\n0\n0\n6= 0\n6= 0\n0\n6= 0\n\nc\n\np1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6= 0\n6= 0\n\n1\n\nr\n0\n6 0\n=\n6= 0\n0\n0\n6= 0\n\nt /U\n\nPhase\nu0\nFM Mott-Insulator 1\nXY Mott-Insulator =\n6 0\nSF1 ,MI2\n0\nMI1 , SF2\n6= 0\nSF1 , 02 (a-SF) 6= 0\nSF1 ,SF2\n6= 0\n\nC\n\n0.005\n\nand the superfluid order parameters \u22061,2 can be calculated from this variational wave-function:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u22061 = zt1 h\u03a8v | b1 |\u03a8v i = zt1 u0 p1 2 + rp2 + u0 h1\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\n\u22062 = zt2 h\u03a8v | b2 |\u03a8v i = zt2 u0 p2 + rh1 + rp3 2 (10)\n\nMathematically, it is possible to show that for all of the\nMott and superfluid phases (except the AFM phase for\nwhich we need to use two sublattices), the variational\nenergy has a stationary point. The parameter values\nat these points and how they translate into the various\nphases is shown in Table I. The transition to superfluidity from the Mott state occurs when it becomes energetically favorable to have non-zero \u2206\u03b1 i.e. non-zero amplitudes of additional particles and holes (p and h) in the\nvariational ground state. For our purposes, it is sufficient\nto take all the coefficients real. This amounts to setting\nthe phase of the superfluid order parameter to zero and\ndoes not affect the variational energy of the state. Note\nthat the wavefunction (Eq. 7) is general enough to incorporate both the FM (u0 = 1) and the XY (u0 = cos(\u03b8/2)\nr = sin(\u03b8/2)) phases of the Mott state. However, since\nthese two states are degenerate to O(t/U ), our simple\nmean-field treatment cannot distinguish between their\nisospin order. In Secs. IV and V we shall carry out\nmore sophisticated treatments of our model which will\ntake into account the effect of O(t2 /U 2 ) fluctuations using canonical transformation and quantum Monte-Carlo.\nIn this section, we shall analyze the O(t/U ) mean-field\ntheory and point out certain qualitative features of the\nphase diagram.\nA.\n\nGeneral features of the phase diagram\n\nAlthough the variational wave function in this section\nexcludes second order exchange effects, the qualitative\nfeatures of the SI transition from the FM and the XY\nphases for n0 = 1 can be understood from Eqs. 8 and\n9. Consider, for example, approaching the SI transition\nfrom FM/XY Mott phase. For \u03bc \u226a U, \u03bbU , since \u03b4E1\u2212 \u226a\n\u03b4E1+ , \u03b4E2+ , at the SI transition point t1 \u2261 tc1 = \u03b4E1\u2212 /z\nand the energy of the variational wavefunction is minimized with r = 0, u0 \u223c 1, p1 = p2 = p3 = 0, h1 6= 0.\nConsequently, from Eq. 10, we have \u22062 = 0, \u22061 6= 0, and\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n/U\n\n0.000\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n/U\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) O(t/U ) mean-field results for the SI\ntransition from the XY phase for \u03bb = 0.4 and \u03b7 = 0.8. The\ninset shows n2 at the transition. Superfluidity sets in a) with\ndepopulation bosons of species 2 in region A (a-SF phase)\nb) simultaneously for both species in region B (SF-SF) and\nc) with Mott phase for 2 and superfluid for 1 in region C\n(MI2 + SF1 ). The vertical dotted lines are guides to the eye\nand represent the positions of \u03bcc1 and \u03bcc2 (see text).\n\nalso\n\u0001\nn1 = h\u03a8v | b\u20201i b1i |\u03a8v i = u20 + 2p21 + p22 \u2261 1\n\u0001\nn2 = h\u03a8v | b\u20202i b2i |\u03a8v i = r2 + 2p23 + p22 = 0 (11)\n\nThus the transition to superfluidity occurs with complete\ndepopulation of species 2. We refer to this phase as a-SF.\nAlternatively one can view this phase as SF1 -MI2 with\na zero filling factor in the Mott phase. Numerically, we\nfind that such a depopulation occurs till a critical value\nof \u03bc = \u03bcc1 .\nIn the other limit, when \u03bc \u2243 \u03bbU \u2265 \u03bcc2 , it is much\nmore favorable to destabilize the Mott state by adding a\nparticle of species 2 since \u03b4E2+ \u226a \u03b4E1\u2212 , \u03b4E1+ . As a result\nthe transition occurs with u0 = 0, r \u2243 1 and p2 6= 0.\nConsequently, the transition takes place with\n\u22062 = 0,\n\nn2 , \u22061 , n1 6= 0\n\n(12)\n\ni.e., we have a transition which is accompanied by a jump\nof population species 2 at the transition. The phase consists of a Mott insulator of species 2 (since \u22062 = 0) and\nsuperfluid of species 1. We call this state MI2 + SF1 .\nFor \u03bcc2 > \u03bc > \u03bcc1 , \u03b4E2+ and \u03b4E1\u2212 are comparable\nand the energy of the ground state at the transition is\nminimized for r, u0 6= 0 and p2 6= 0. In this case, provided\n\u03b7 6= 0, both \u22061 and \u22062 are non-zero at the transition\nimplying simultaneous onset of superfluidity of species 1\nand 2 (referred to as SF-SF). The width of this region\nis expected to be large at large \u03b7, since higher t2 makes\nit energetically more favorable to realize superfluidity of\nspecies 2.\n\n\f6\nThe values of \u03bcc1 and \u03bcc2 are shown for representative\nvalues of \u03b7 = 0.8 and \u03bb = 0.4 in Fig. 4. The phase diagram corroborates the above discussion. From the inset\nof Fig. 4, we find that there are three distinct regions\nwhere the SI transition takes place with a) depopulation\nof species 2 (region A), b) simultaneous setting of superfluidity of the two species (region B), and c) Mott\ninsulating phase of species 2 and superfluidiy of species 1\n(region C). The situation here is in sharp contrast to the\neven filling case which will always have an intermediate\nstate with superfluidity of species 1 and insulating state\nof species 2 for 0 < \u03b7 < 1.\nUpon further increase of t1 from the critical value t1c ,\ntwo scenarios are possible. If superfluidity sets in with\ndepopulation, increasing t1 does not change the situation\nfurther. On the other hand, if the transition occurs to\neither the SF-SF or MI2 + SF1 phase, upon increasing\nt1 , the fraction of B atoms in the superfluid decreases as\nshown in Fig. 5 for a set of representative values of \u03b7, \u03bb\nand \u03bc. Finally, one crosses a critical value t\u22171 at which it\nbecomes energetically favorable for the system to depopulate. This happens at large enough t1 \u2265 t\u22171 \u223c \u03b4E1+ /z,\nat which the variational energy minima shifts to u0 6= 0,\nr = p2 = 0. Beyond this point, we only find superfluidity\nof species 1. Within O(t/U ) mean-field theory, such a\ntransition from\nP SF-SF2to a-SF phase is found to be first\norder since\n\u03b1=1,2 \u2206\u03b1 /zt\u03b1 is discontinuous across the\ntransition.\nAlthough we do not show it explicitly here, a similar\nconsideration remains valid for the SI transition from the\nAFM phase. This can again be seen by dividing the lattice into the usual A and B sublattices and constructing\nan appropriate two sublattice variational wavefunction.\nWe do not find any translational symmetry broken superfluid phases. We also note that the above discussions\nhave to be modified for n0 6= 1, where the Mott state\ncan also be destabilized by adding holes of species 2. For\nexample, when n0 \u226b 1, for \u03bc \u226a \u03bb, \u03b4E1\u2212 \u2248 \u03b4E2\u2212 . Thus\nif \u03b7 6= 0, we expect the ground state energy to be always\nminimized for u0 , r 6= 0 at the transition. Consequently,\nthere will be no depopulation for any finite \u03b7 in this limit.\nIn the rest of this work, we shall restrict all discussion to\nodd fillings with n0 = 1.\n\nB.\n\nNecessity of going beyond the O(t/U ) mean-field\ntheory\n\nWe now discuss the limitations of the mean-field theory to set the stage for incorporating the fluctuation effects. To understand why using the mean-field theory\nis dangerous in the present context, consider plotting\nthe mean-field phase diagram at a fixed \u03bc/U = 0.5 and\nt1 /U = 0.04 as a function of \u03b7 and \u03bb. Such a phase diagram is shown in Fig. 6. Here, we have used the phase\ndiagram (Fig. 2) of the XXZ model [Eq. (5)] to determine the isospin phases since the O(t/U ) mean-field theory can not distinguish between them.

The system enters the MI2 + SF1\nphase at t = tc1 (vertical dotted line between regions A and B)\nfrom a FM Mott phase (region A). Note that the transition\noccurs with a spontaneous jump of n2 and is hence expected\nto be first order. As we increase t1 , both species becomes\nsuperfluid (region B), until t1 reaches t\u22171 (vertical dotted line\nbetween region B and C) where the system depopulates. The\ndepopulation occurs with a jump in \u22061 and is therefore first\norder.\n\nthe phase diagram (Fig. 6) corroborates the expectations\nbased on the qualitative discussion of the Sec. III A. For\nsmall \u03b7 (transition from FM/AFM phases), the system\nfavors a-SF phase while for larger \u03b7 (transition from the\nXY-phase) the SF-SF phase dominates.\nHowever, consider now plotting such a phase diagram\nnear \u03bcc1 or \u03bcc2 . Clearly, we expect that incorporating\nexchange effects will make it harder for the isospins to\nflip, since now it costs an energy O(t2 /U 2 ). This will,\nin general, shift the positions of \u03bcc1 and \u03bcc2 from their\nmean-field values. Therefore, near \u03bcc1 or \u03bcc2 , the phase\ndiagrams in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb plane predicted by the mean-field\ntheory will be qualitatively different from the true phase\ndiagrams. In this sense, the failure of the O(t/U ) meanfield theory in the present case is much more severe compared to the usual SI transition for single species bosons.\nHowever, as long as we are away form the critical \u03bc values, such a mean-field theory gives qualitatively correct\nresults and therefore the scenario described in the previous section remains largely valid.\nAnother problem of the O(t/U ) mean-field theory is\nthat it overestimates the jump of n1 or n2 at the transition since it does not take into account the energy cost of\nan isospin flip. Consequently, it can erroneously predict\nfirst-order MI-SF or a-SF to SF-SF transitions where in\nreality such transitions might be second order.

We shall\nonly consider the case n0 = 1, although generalization to\nother values of n0 is straightforward. To do this, we first\nintroduce the projection operators P\u03c3 acting on the two\nsites associated with each bond \u03c3. P\u03c3 projects the state\nof the system to the manifold of states having one particle\non each site of the bond. Such a projection operator can\nbe decomposed into two parts depending on whether the\nbosons occupying the sites of the bond are of the same\nor different species: P\u03c3 = P\u03c30 + P\u03c31 . For instance for a\nhorizontal bond we can write\nP\u03c3h = P\u03c30h + P\u03c31h\n\nIV.\n\nCANONICAL TRANSFORMATION\n\nThe effect of fluctuation to second order in t/U can\nbe taken into account using a suitable canonical transformation method. We describe the implementation of\nthis method in subsection IV A and present the phase\ndiagrams in subsection IV B.\n\nA.\n\nImplementing the canonical transformation\n\nWe begin by separating the Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltoP\nnian (Eq. 2) into an onsite term H0 = i Hi (Eq. 3) and\nthe hopping terms T . The first step is to write T in terms\nof sum over bonds \u03c3 between the neighboring lattice site.\nTo this end, as shown in Fig. 7, we can decompose the\nhopping into hopping on vertical and horizontal bonds,\nlabeled \u03c3v,h , between adjacent sites. The hopping term\n\nP\u03c30h = (|1, 0i h1, 0|)\u03c3h \u2297 (|1, 0i h1, 0|)\u03c3h\nL\n\nR\n\n+ (|0, 1i h0, 1|)\u03c3h \u2297 (|0, 1i h0, 1|)\u03c3h\nL\n\nP\u03c31h\n\nR\n\n(16)\n\n= (|0, 1i h0, 1|)\u03c3h \u2297 (|1, 0i h1, 0|)\u03c3h\nL\n\nR\n\n+ (|1, 0i h1, 0|)\u03c3h \u2297 (|0, 1i h0, 1|)\u03c3h\nL\n\nR\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the state |1, 0i denotes |n1 = 1, n2 = 0i as before\nand the subscript on the parentheses denotes the bond\nand which of the sites the operators act on (cf. Fig. 7).\nUsing the projection operator (Eqs. 16,17), we now decompose T\u03c3 (Eq. 13) into two parts\nT\u03c3 = P\u03c3\u22a5 T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u22a5 + (T\u03c3 P\u03c3 + P\u03c3 T\u03c3 ) = T\u03c30 + T\u03c31 (18)\nwhere P\u03c3\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 P\u03c3 . The idea is now to use these results\nto seek a unitary transformation\nH \u2217 = eiS He\u2212iS = H + [iS, H] +\n\n1\n[iS, [iS, H]] + ...\n2\n(19)\n\n\f8\nwhich eliminates the terms T\u03c31 to O(t/U ). It turns out\nthat a suitable choice of S is\ni X\ni X \u03bb\nS =\n[\u03bbP\u03c30 + P\u03c31 , T\u03c3 ] =\n[P , T\u03c3 ] (20)\n\u03bbU \u03c3\n\u03bbU \u03c3 \u03c3\nwhere we have introduced the notation P\u03c3\u03bb = \u03bbP\u03c30 + P\u03c31\nfor future convenience. We now expand H (Eq. 19) in\npowers of S. Since S is first order in t/U , this is equivalent to an expansion in t/U and we have to O(t2 /U 2 ),\n#\n\"\nX\nX\n\u2217\nH = H0 +\nT\u03c3 + iS, H0 +\nT\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\n1\n+ [iS, [iS, H0 ]] + O(t3 /U 3 )\n2\n\n(21)\n\nWe now evaluate the different terms in Eq. (21).\nThe algebra is straightforward, but lengthy and we\npresent some details in Appendix A. The final result, to\nO(t2 /U 2 ), is\nX\nH \u2217 = H0 +\nP\u03c3\u22a5 T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u22a5\n\u03c3\n\n\u0003\n1 X\u0002 \u03bb 2\n\u2212\nP\u03c3 T\u03c3 P\u03c3 \u2212 T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u03bb T\u03c3 + h.c.\n2\u03bbU \u03c3\n1 X\u0002 \u03bb\nP T\u03c3 T\u03c3+j \u2212 T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u03bb T\u03c3+j\n\u2212\n\u03bbU \u03c3,j \u03c3\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u22122 P\u03c3\u03bb T\u03c3 T\u03c3+j P\u03c3+j \u2212 T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u03bb P\u03c3+j T\u03c3+j + h.c.\n(22)\n\nwhere the sum over j extends over bonds which are nearest neighbors to \u03c3. We note that the third and the\nfourth terms of Eq. 22 represent the effective XXZ model\n[Eq. (5)] of Section II and the two-particle hopping processes respectively, whereas the terms in the last line involve hopping operators on neighboring bonds and are\nexpected to be important in the superfluid phases.\nB.\n\nPhase Diagram\n\nThe phase diagram of H \u2217 is obtained by dividing the\nlattice into two sublattices A and BQand using\nQ an on-site\nvariational wavefunction |\u03c8v i =\ni\u2208A\nj\u2208B |\u03c8ii |\u03c8ij .\nThe division into two sublattices is essential for taking\ninto account the AFM phase. We note that this is equivalent to generalizing the mean-field treatment of Sec.\nIII to incorporate second order fluctuation corrections.\nAlthough it is cumbersome to evaluate the expectation\nvalue h\u03c8v | H \u2217 |\u03c8v i analytically, it can be calculated numerically by representing the various operators in the\nHamiltonian as matrices in an appropriately chosen basis. The task of minimizing h\u03c8v | H \u2217 |\u03c8v i is then a numerical optimization problem. Truncating the Hilbert\nspace to have at most two particles on each site, we\nperform constrained (to keep the norm to unity) optimization for each point in the phase diagram. We use\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) O(t2 /U 2 ) mean-field phase diagram\nfor the two-species model as a function \u03b7 and \u03bb for \u03bc = \u03bbU/2.\nThe plot for t1 /U = 0.04 should be compared with the phase\ndiagram obtained to O(t/U ) in Fig. 6 (see text). Note the\ngradual evolution of the different phases with increase of t1 .\nThe existence of the multicritical point is due to the special\nsymmetry at \u03bc = \u03bbU/2 where adding a hole or a particle of\nspecies 2 to the FM Mott state cost equal energies. Quantum\nMonte Carlo however reveals that these multicritical points\ncan be split (See Sec. V).\n\na sequential quadratic programming algorithm from the\nMATLAB (TM) optimization toolbox for this task. Due\nto nontrivial energy landscapes and possible existence of\nfirst order transitions, several starting points,including\nrandom starting points, were used as input to the algorithm.\nFirst, we show the phase diagram in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb plane for\n\u03bc/U = 0.5\u03bb in Fig. 8, which shows the gradual evolution\nof the phases of the system as t1 is increased. A comparison of Fig. 8 for t1 /U = 0.04 to its O(t/U ) mean-field\ncounterpart [Fig. (6)], immediately shows us the importance of incorporating the exchange effects. Whereas the\nO(t/U ) mean-field phase diagram shows a large boundary between the FM and the SF-SF phase indicating a\nfirst order transition, Fig 8 shows only second order phase\nboundaries and no direct transition between FM and SFSF phases. This clearly points out that incorporating the\nexchange effects can lead to qualitatively different results.\nThe transition between the FM and the a-SF phases\nis second order, as expected. The transition between the\na-SF and SF-SF phases is also found to be second order,\nin contrast to the prediction of the O(t/U ) mean-field\ntheory. This is a consequence of incorporating the second order fluctuation corrections. We note that the a-SF\n- SF-SF transition can alternatively be viewed as a Mottinsulator (with n0 = 0) - superfluid transition of species\n2 in the presence of species 1 in a superfluid state. The\nsupersolid (SS) phase obtained for small values of \u03bb and\n\u03b7 represents a superfluid phase with broken sublattice\n\n\f9\n\nFM\n\n\u03bb\nSF-S F\n\nSF+MI\n\n\u03b7\nFIG. 9: (Color online) O(t2 /U 2 ) mean-field phase diagram for\nthe two-species model as a function \u03b7 and \u03bb for \u03bc/U = 0.1\u03bb\nand t1 /U = 0.01. The superfluidity is a-SF for a large parameter regime as predicted by the O(t/U ) mean-field theory.\n\nsymmetry. This is precisely the region where zt2 /\u03bbU becomes large and the perturbation theory breaks down.\nWe shall see in the next section using Monte Carlo that\nthe SS phase is indeed an artifact and signifies the breakdown of perturbation theory.\nSimilar phase diagrams for \u03bc/U = 0.1\u03bb and \u03bc/U =\n0.9\u03bb and t1 /U = 0.01 are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 respectively. These plots confirm that the qualitative expectations of the O(t/U ) mean-field theory. For \u03bc/U = 0.1\u03bb,\nwe find a large a-SF region and the transition to a-SF occurs from both FM and XY phases [Fig. (9)], the transitions from XY to a-SF being first order. For \u03bc/U = 0.9\u03bb\n(Fig. 10), the a-SF phase is replaced by MI2 + SF1 . Here\nwe find a direct first order transition between the FM\nand MI2 + SF1 phases. These first order transitions are\nin perfect agreement with the predictions of the O(t/U )\nmean-field theory.\n\nV.\n\nQUANTUM MONTE CARLO\n\nTo verify that the inclusion of O(t2 /U 2 ) corrections\nusing the canonical transformation procedure as carried\nout in section IV really gives an improvement over the\nO(t/U ) mean-field theory in section III, we have performed quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) studies using the\nStochastic Series Expansion method introduced by Sandwik et al .19,20 . Here we have used a particular form of\nthese updates, directed loop-updates. For details see\nRef. 21. The basis states used were from a truncated\nHilbert space in which each site hosts at most two atoms\nper site, in the same way as done in the mean-field and\ncanonical transformation treatments. We expect such a\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) O(t2 /U 2 ) phase diagram for the twospecies model as a function \u03b7 and \u03bb for \u03bc/U = 0.9\u03bb for\nt1 /U = 0.02. We see a large area of MI2 + SF1 phase again\nin accordance with the mean-field theory prediction.\n\ntruncation to be adequate for reproducing the phase diagram since we work with n0 = 1 and are always close\nto the MI-SF transition. We have investigated phase\ndiagrams in the range \u03bc/U = 0.1\u03bb \u2212 0.8\u03bb and found\nMonte-Carlo results agreeing well with the qualitative\npredictions of both Secs. III and IV and we now turn\nto a critical comparison between the results obtained by\ndifferent methods.\nFirst, QMC confirms our suspicion that the appearance\nof the SS phase for small \u03bb is indeed an artifact of the\nbreakdown of the second order perturbation theory at\nsmall \u03bb. Second, comparisons with QMC show that the\ndetails of the phase diagram are much better reproduced\nusing the canonical transformation method.\nA comparison between the different methods can be\nseen in Fig. 11 where the phase diagram has been drawn\nfor \u03bc/U = 0.25\u03bb, t1 /U = 0.02. The dotted, dashed and\ndash-dotted lines are the phase boundaries as obtained\nusing the O(t/U ) mean field theory of section III. As can\nbe seen there is a large discrepancy between the location\nof the phase boundaries as compared to the O(t2 /U 2 )\nmean field theory. The discrete set of points represent\nthe phase boundaries obtained by QMC. Comparing the\nthree methods we thus see that the inclusion of O(t2 /U 2 )\neffects yields the phase boundaries with great accuracy.\nWe also find that the Monte Carlo study predicts the\na-SF/SF-SF transition to be second order. This validates the result obtained using the canonical transformation method and shows that the expectation of a first\norder a-SF-SF-SF transition based on O(t/U ) mean-field\ntheory (Sec. III) was an artifact of omitting O(t2 /U 2 )\ncorrections.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) Comparative phase diagram for the\ntwo-species model as a function \u03b7 and \u03bb for \u03bc/U = 0.25\u03bb\nfor t1 /U = 0.02. The discrete points represent the phase\nboundaries as calculated using quantum Monte-Carlo while\nthe colored regions are obtained from the O(t2 /U 2 ) mean\nfield theory. The shape of the markers represent the different\nphase boundaries; a-SF/SF-SF (stars) ; SF-SF/XY (circles);\na-SF/FM (right triangles); FM/XY (up triangles); a-SF/XY\n(squares). As comparison the phase boundaries obtained using the O(t/U ) mean field theory are also shown as lines; aSF/Mott (dotted); a-SF/SF-SF (dash-dotted); SF-SF/Mott\n(dashed).\n\nAn interesting prediction, and possible failure, of the\nO(t2 /U 2 ) mean-field theory is the existence of continuous\nparameter region having points where four phases meet\n(cf. the diagrams for t1 = 0.04 and t1 = 0.05 in Fig. 8).\nHowever, using QMC for systems of sizes up to 20 \u00d7 20\nsites and inverse temperatures \u03b2 = 1500/U for parameter\nvalues \u03bc = 0.5\u03bbU , t1 = 0.04, suggests that although the\nphase boundaries come very close they do not meet at\na single point but a small region showing a first order\ntransition between the a-SF and the XY phase seems to\nremain.\n\nVI.\n\nDETECTING THE DIFFERENT PHASES\n\nThe traditional way of examining the existence of superfluidity in trapped boson systems is to switch off the\ntrap, let the cloud of atoms expand freely and image\nthe expanding cloud. The momentum distribution of\nthe atoms inside the trap can then be inferred by looking at their position, or equivalently density, distribution\nin the expanded cloud. Since the momentum distribution function of the atoms is characterized by the presence/absence of coherence peaks in the superfluid/Mott\ninsulating states, such a measurement serves as a qual-\n\nitative probe of the state of the atoms inside the trap1 .\nIn our proposed setup, however, such a simple expansion\nalone, which can not distinguish between the two species,\nwill not be able to distinguish between all the different\nphases. Nevertheless, since the two species have different\nmagnetic moments (mF = \u22122 and mF = \u22121), it is possible to separate them during the expansion using a pair\nof Stern-Gerlach magnets24,25 . The expanding cloud will\nthen be separated into two clouds if both species of atoms\nare present in the system. This, together with the momentum distribution measurement, will qualitatively distinguish between all the phases obtained in this work. To\nmake this statement concrete, let us consider the phase\ndiagram shown in Fig. 9. Here the proposed set of measurements will lead to a) single cloud with no coherence\npeak (FM phase) or b) single cloud with coherence peak\n(a-SF phase), or c) two clouds with no coherence peaks\n(XY phase) or d) two clouds with a coherence peak (SFSF phase). Thus this methods allows, for instance, the\ndetection of the mixed phases (MI2 + SF1 , a-SF, and SFSF). It further provides a tool for finding the phase transitions between the Mott phases for n0 = 1. The second\norder transition from the XY-phase to the FM phase, for\nexample, will be associated with gradual depletion of the\natoms in one of the clouds whereas the transition to the\nAFM phase will be characterized by an abrupt change\nfrom a single to a double cloud.\nThe above mentioned detection technique, however,\ndoes not provide any evidence of the isospin order in\nthe Mott states since they can not probe the spatial\ncorrelations between the atoms at a lattice scale. Such\ncorrelations can be probed, for example, by tilting the\noptical lattice with a potential gradient1 . Deep inside\nthe Mott phase, such a potential gradient will excite\nthe system only if E = Edipole , where E is the potential energy shift between adjacent lattice due to the field\ngradient and Edipole is the dipole formation energy1,26 .\nThe dipole formation energy will sharply change across\nthe phase transition lines between AFM-XY and AFMFM phases and consequently the peak in the excitation\nwidth, measured in Ref. 1 as a function of the applied\nfield gradient, shall show an abrupt shift at the transitions across these phases. In contrast, there will be a\ngradual shift of the peak position as one moves from the\nXY to the FM phase. Alternatively, isospin order can\nalso be measured by probing noise correlation of the expanding clouds27,28,29 . For example, a transition from\nthe FM to AFM isospin states will be marked by appearance of additional peaks in the noise spectrum at half\nthe reciprocal lattice vector. The detection of the XY\nphase can also be obtained by the Ramsey spectroscopy\ntechnique as suggested in Ref. 10.\nAnother possible way of detecting the phases is to\nimage the expanding cloud by passing a linearly polarized laser beam through it. As shown in Ref. 30,\nthe angle of rotation of the plane of polarization (\u03b8rot )\nof the outgoing laser beam is proportional to the net\nmz along the direction of propagation (x\u22a5 )of the beam:\n\n\f11\nR\n\u03b8rot \u223c dx\u22a5 mz (x\u22a5 ). \u03b8rot can then be easily measured\nby passing the outgoing beam through a crossed polarizer since the intensity of the beam coming out of the\ncrossed polarizer is I\u2212 \u223c sin2 (\u03b8rot ). We therefore expect I\u2212 to jump discontinuously across any first order\ntransitions such as FM-AFM or XY-ASF phase boundaries and gradually change across second order transitions such as the FM-a-SF or XY-2SF phase boundaries.\nOf course, such measurements have to be supplemented\nwith momentum distribution function measurement to\ndistinguish between the superfluid and Mott phases.\nA brief comment on system preparation and validity\nof use of grand canonical ensemble is in order here. One\nshould note that although use of a grand canonical ensemble in the single species case is a good approximation\ndue to the presence of a confining potential (in this case\nthe confining potential produces spatial inhomogeneities\nin the filling factor and some of the outer regions will act\nlike a particle reservoir for the inner region), this is not\nnecessarily the case in the two species system and other\nmeans may have to be sought.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the MI-SF transition in\na consisting of two species of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice in a previously unexplored parameter region.\nWe have used an O(t/U ) mean-field theory to explain\nthe qualitative features of the transition in most regions\nof the phase diagram. This is followed by incorporating\nthe O(t2 /U 2 ) exchange effects using a canonical transformation method and a quantum Monte Carlo calculation.\nAll of these methods show that the superfluid-insulator\ntransition can occur with either depopulation of species\n2 (a-SF phase) or simultaneous onset of superfluidity of\nboth species (SF-SF phase) or Mott insulator of species 2\ncoexisting with superfluid of species 1 (MI2 + SF1 phase)\nand can be first order in large regions of the phase diagram. We have also shown that, whereas some qualitative features of the SI transition can be obtained from\nO(t/U ) mean-field theory, incorporating the O(t2 /U 2 )\ncorrections is necessary to deduce the details of the phase\ndiagram and order of the transitions between the phases.\nOur quantum Monte Carlo study lends strong support to\nthe above-mentioned results and also shows screening of\nbosons of species 2 in the SF-SF phase. We also discussed\npossible experimental tests of some of our predictions.\n\ncation (STINT). MCC was supported by grant No. R052004-000-11004-0 from Korean Ministry of Science and\nTechnology.

Consequently, expansion of Eq.\n26 leads to terms which can be classified into two categories.The first type of terms involves two hopping operators T\u03c3 on the same bond while the second involves the\nhopping operators on the different bonds:\n\nNote that the first two terms of Eq. 29 represent second order virtual hopping processes and thus give the\nt2 /U terms responsible for the isospin ordering of the\nMott phases, while the third term represents two particlehopping across a bond with an intermediate virtual state\nof one particle on each side of the bond.\n\nH2 = H2a + H2b\n\u0003\n1 X\u0002 \u03bb\n[P\u03c3 , T\u03c3 ], M\u03c3\nH2a = \u2212\n\u03bbU \u03c3\n\u0003\n1 XX\u0002 \u03bb\nH2b =\n[P\u03c3 , T\u03c3 ], M\u03c3+j\n\u03bbU \u03c3 j\n\nNext we come to computation of H2b . We again expand out the operators as before. Here, the crucial iden\u03bb\ntity is that any terms of the form P\u03c3 T\u03c3 P\u03c3+j\nT\u03c3+j or\n\u03bb\nP\u03c3+j T\u03c3+j P\u03c3 T\u03c3 vanish as long as \u03c3 and \u03c3 + j denotes\nnearest-neighbor bonds. Using this, one gets\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nwhere the sum over j extend over the bonds which are\nnearest neighbors to \u03c3.\nWe first consider H2a . We expand the operators M\u03c3\nand P\u03c3\u03bb and use the relation [P\u03c3 , P\u03c3\u03bb ] = 0. Also, we\nnote that all terms of the form P\u03c31 T\u03c3 P\u03c30 T\u03c3 in such an\nexpansion vanish identically. After some straightforward\nalgebra, one obtains\nH2a\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 \u03bb 2\n= \u2212\nP\u03c3 T\u03c3 P\u03c3 + P\u03c3 T\u03c32 P\u03c3\u03bb \u2212 2T\u03c3 P\u03c3\u03bb T\u03c3 (29)\n\u03bbU\n\nM.
