The low-temperature evolution of spin resonance response is a result\nof the specific modification of one-dimensional spinon continuum under the action of the uniform\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DM) within the spin chains. Parameters of the uniform DM\ninteraction are derived from the experiment.\n\nQuantum antiferromagnets on triangular lattice exhibit a variety of unusual phases with intriguing physical\nproperties. In this work we report results of electron\nspin resonance (ESR) study of quasi two-dimensional\n(2D) triangular antiferromagnet Cs2 CuCl4 in the paramagnetic phase. Cs2 CuCl4 realizes distorted triangular\nlattice with strong exchange J along the base of the triangular unit and weaker exchange integral J \u2032 = 0.34J\nalong lateral sides of the triangle. The material orders\nbelow TN = 0.62 K into a long-range 3D spiral state [1].\nThis N\u00e9el point is far below the Curie-Weiss temperature TCW =4 K. In the intermediate temperature range\nTN < T < TCW a spin-liquid phase with strong in-chain\nspin correlations takes place. Magnetic properties of\nCs2 CuCl4 are well described by a quasi-one-dimensional\n(1D) model of weakly coupled spin S = 1/2 chains. In\nparticular, inelastic neutron scattering experiments [1, 2]\nare nicely explained by a parameter-free theory of dispersing continuum of one-dimensional spinons [3]. Moreover, the same description, extended in Ref. [4] to include residual symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\n(DM) interactions between the Cu-spins, is able to consistently explain majority of the phases in the T \u2212 H phase\ndiagram, for three different directions of the magnetic\nfield [5]. In addition, several numerical investigations\n[6, 7] of the spatially anisotropic J \u2212 J \u2032 Heisenberg model\nalso find that in a wide region of the parameter space\n0 \u2264 J \u2032 /J \u2264 0.6 the spin chains are almost decoupled\nand inter-chain spin correlations are exponentially weak.\nThis behavior follows from highly frustrated structure of\nthe inter-chain exchange J \u2032 and provides additional justification to the 1D-based approach [4] to Cs2 CuCl4 .\nElectron spin resonance (ESR) represents a sensitive\nprobe of low-energy magnetic excitations with zero momenta, q \u2248 0. It is well known as a method providing fine details of low-energy spin spectra in both\nordered and paramagnetic [8\u201310] phases. Importantly,\nboth the position and the linewidth of the ESR signal\n\nare crucially sensitive to anisotropies of the spin Hamiltonian. Here we report a dramatic manifestation of the\nuniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction on the\nESR spectrum of Cs2 CuCl4 in the paramagnetic phase.\nWe observe and explain splitting of the ESR mode into\ntwo modes with lowering the temperature, significantly\nextending previous study [11], and also find strong dependence of the ESR absorption on the polarization of\nthe microwave magnetic field h with respect to the DM\nvector D in zero external field.\nThe crystal samples were grown by two methods. First\nset of samples was prepared by the crystallization from\nthe melt of a stoichiometric mixture of CsCuCl3 and CsCl\nin an ampule, which was slowly pulled from the hot (T=\n520\u25e6C) area of the oven. The second method was crystallization from solution [12]. The room temperature\ncrystal lattice parameters for both sets of crystals are\na=9.75 \u00c5, b=7.607 \u00c5, c=12.394\u00c5. The samples obtained\nby last method have natural faces and are lengthened\nalong b-axes. Both sets of crystals demonstrated identical ESR signals. The study in the frequency range 9-90\nGHz was performed with a set of homemade spectrometers equipped with cryomagnets. The crystal samples\nwere placed within microwave resonators at the maximum of the microwave magnetic field. The resonance\nlines were taken at the fixed frequency, as dependences of\nmicrowave power, transmitted through the resonator, on\nthe external magnetic field. Temperatures down to 1.3 K\n(0.4 K), were obtained by pumping vapor of 4 He (3 He),\ncorrespondingly. Cooling down to 0.1 K was achieved\nwith the help of a dilution cryostat Kelvinox-400.\nAt temperatures above T = 10 K crystals of Cs2 CuCl4\nexhibit conventional paramagnetic resonance of Cu2+\nS = 1/2 magnetic ions with a single narrow line corresponding to g-factor values ga = 2.20 \u00b1 0.02, gb =\n2.08\u00b10.02, gc = 2.30\u00b10.02 for the magnetic field applied\nalong a, b and c axes correspondingly. These g-factor\nvalues agree well with those reported earlier at T = 300\n\n\f2\nT=1.3 K is a half of that at T=4 K. The resonant frequencies above 14 GHz may be well fitted by the frequencyfield relation of an ordered antiferromagnet with \"gap\"\n\u2206/(2\u03c0~) = 14 GHz,\np\n(1)\n2\u03c0~\u03bd = (g\u03bcB H)2 + \u22062 .\n\nFIG. 1.

This evolution depends strongly on\nthe microwave frequency \u03bd and orientation of the external magnetic field H. (i) For H k b, we observe a single\nLorentzian line shifting with cooling to lower fields (see\nFig. 1). At \u03bd=14 GHz the resonance field is near zero.\nAt lower frequencies, we observe a strong decrease of the\nintensity with cooling, and no visible shift from the paramagnetic resonance field, in contrast to ESR lines taken\nat \u03bd >17 GHz, which exhibit a shift and do not loose intensity at cooling. At \u03bd=9 GHz the integral intensity at\n\n(ii) For H k a, c, the ESR line strongly broadens on\ncooling, and its shape distorts, as shown in the inserts\nof Fig. 2. The absorption at T =1.3 K may be fitted\nby a sum of two Lorentzians, indicating the splitting of\nthe resonance mode. The \u03bd(H) dependence at H k a\nis presented in Fig. 2. Two modes at T = 1.3 K were\nresolved for measurements in the frequency range 14-50\nGHz. At higher frequencies the splitting is masked by\nnatural linewidth, which prevents the resolution of the\ndoublet, while at lower frequencies the signal becomes\ntoo broad. The angular \u03c6 dependence of the resonance\nfield Hr = H(sin \u03c6, cos \u03c6, 0) within the a \u2212 b plane, taken\nat \u03bd=27 GHz and T =1.3 K, is shown in Fig.3. For H k c\nthe splitting of about 0.35 \u00b10.1 T is resolved for frequencies 27 and 31 GHz.\n(iii) We have also studied polarization dependence of\nthe ESR absorption at H \u2192 0. Fig. 4 shows transmission vs field dependences at T = 1.3 K and T = 6 K for\ndifferent orientations of the microwave and static fields\nwith respect to the crystal axes, but with h \u22a5 H. The\nmeasurements are done at \u03bd = 14 GHz. At T > 6 K\nboth the position and the lineshape of the paramagnetic\nresonance line are the same for all three principal polarizations of the microwave field. However, at T = 1.3 K,\nthe absorption in zero field for h k b is at least three\ntimes more intensive than for h k a, c.\nThe splitting of the ESR line for H k c and the polarization dependence of the signal were also detected\npreviously in Ref. [11].\nWe now turn to explanation of the data and show that\nall unusual features of the ESR signal reported above\nare naturally explained by quasi-1D nature of Cs2 CuCl4 .\nThe relevant Hamiltonian\nX\nH=\nJSx,y,z * Sx+1,y,z \u2212 Dy,z * Sx,y,z \u00d7 Sx+1,y,z +\nx,y,z\n\n\u2212g\u03bcB H * Sx,y,z + ...\n\n(2)\n\ncontains three terms: the first describes intrachain exchange J (x runs along crystal b axis), the second \u2013 uniform DM interaction Dy,z between chain spins, and the\nthird is the usual Zeeman term, allowing for anisotropic\ng-factor. The dots stand for the omitted interchain exchange as well as DM interactions on interchain bonds.\nDetailed symmetry analysis of the allowed DM interactions [4] shows that there are four different orientations\nof the DM vector (see Fig. 6 in [4]) depending on chain's\ninteger coordinates y, z: Dy,z = Da (\u22121)z \u00e2 + Dc (\u22121)y \u0109.\nHere z indices magnetic b \u2212 c layers, while y numerates\nchains within a layer. Crucially, crystal symmetry forbids\nDM vector to have component along the chain b axis.[4]\n\n\f3\n\n1.2\n\nExperiment, T=1.3 K\nTheory\n\n1.1\n\n,\n\nParamagnetic, T=10 K\n\nMagnetic Field (T)\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\nb\n\n0.4\n0\n\na\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\na\n\nb\n120\n\n150\n\n180\n\n210\n\n240\n\n270\n\nb\n300\n\n330\n\n360\n\nAngle (deg.)\n\nFIG. 3.

The polarization effect at \u03bd = 14.44 GHz for H \u2192 0.\nCircles with error bars show the uncertainty resulting from\nnormalizing the signals to zero absorption at H > 1.5 T.\n\nThe essence of the observed ESR line splitting can be\nexplained by considering a single Heisenberg chain with\nuniform DM interaction with vector D along the local\n\u1e91 axis, when the field is lined up along the same axis\n(Dy,z \u2192 D\u1e91, H \u2192 H \u1e91). In this geometry the DM interaction can be gauged away by position-dependent rotation of lattice spins,\n+\n+\nz\nz\nSx,y,z\n= S\u0303x,y,z\nei\u03b1x , Sx,y,z\n= S\u0303x,y,z\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThe rotation angle tan(\u03b1) \u2248 \u03b1 = \u2212D/J is chosen so\n\nas to eliminate the DM coupling from the Hamiltonian.\nThe transformed H\u0303 describes spin chain with quadratic\nin D easy-plane anisotropy. To linear in D/J accuracy\nthe ESR response of this model coincides with that of\nan isotropic Heisenberg chain, detailed study of which is\ndescribed in Ref.[10]. ESR absorption is determined by\nthe transverse structure factor Sxx (\u03c9, q\u0303) = Syy (\u03c9, q\u0303) of\nthe chain, evaluated at q\u0303 = 0. This is produced by characteristic to the spin-1/2 chain spinon continuum and is\ndescribed by a sum of delta-function peaks at frequencies ~\u03c9\u00b1 = |~v q\u0303 \u00b1 g\u03bcB H|, see eq.(3.16) of [10] and Fig.5.\nHere v = \u03c0Ja0 /(2~) is the zero-field spinon velocity and\na0 is the lattice spacing [14]. The response in the original\n(un-rotated) basis is obtained by un-doing the momentum boost (3), which corresponds to setting q\u0303 = D/Ja0\nin the expression for the structure factor Sxx/yy . This\nimmediately implies the splitting of the ESR line into\ntwo lines, at frequencies ~\u03c9\u00b1 = |g\u03bcB H \u00b1 \u03c0D/2|. Note\nthat for small D/H the splitting \u03c0D = \u03c0(Da2 + Dc2 )1/2 is\nlinear in D which justifies our neglect of the easy-plane\nanisotropy.\nWhile the four-sublattice structure of the DM vectors makes it impossible to study the D k H configuration in Cs2 CuCl4 , the above argument allows one to\nimmediately understand polarization-dependent absorption (finding (iii) above) in zero magnetic field, at the frequency 2\u03c0\u03bd = \u03c0D/2~. Since the microwave absorption is\nproportional to the square of the microwave field component perpendicular to the effective field, we conclude that\nconfiguration with h \u22a5 D (that is, h k b) should result in\nmaximal possible absorption. For h along the a (c) axis,\nabsorption is a factor Dc2 /D2 (Da2 /D2 ) smaller. Using\nnumerical estimates of Da,c derived below, the absorption for different polarizations should obey the relations:\nPb /Pa \u2243 1.6 and Pb /Pc \u2243 2.8. This agrees qualitatively\nwith our data presented in Fig. 4 \u2013 the zero field absorption at \u03bd = 14 and 17 GHz is a factor of 3 more intensive\nfor h k b than for h k a, c .\nTo understand our findings (i) and (ii), one needs to\nanalyze the arbitrary orientation of the H and D vectors,\nwhich is the problem solved in [15]. The main physical point of Ref.[15] consists in the observation that a\nuniform DM interaction, much like a spin-orbit Rashba\ninteraction in 2D conductors [16\u201318], acts on spinon excitations of 1D chains as an internal momentum-dependent\nmagnetic field. Technically, this observation follows from\nspin-current formulation [14] of the problem (2), which is\nvalid below the strong-coupling temperature scale T0 \u223c\nJe\u2212\u03c0S (S = 1/2 for the spin chain here)[19]. The\nspin currents MR/L represent spin density fluctuations\nof spinons near the right/left (R/L) Fermi points of a\n1D system. It follows that the right and left-moving\ncurrents experience different, in magnitude and direction, total magnetic fields: BR = H + ~vD/g\u03bcB J and\nBL = H \u2212 ~vD/g\u03bcB J. It is then natural that the ESR\nresponse of such a chain consists of two peaks at frequen-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5. Spinon spectrum of S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain for q \u223c\n0 with (solid lines) and without (dashed lines) DM interaction.\nWhen D k H, momentum is boosted by q = D/Ja0 .\n\ncies 2\u03c0~\u03bdR/L = g\u03bcB BR/L .[15]\nFor the Cs2 CuCl4 -specific configuration of chain DM\ninteractions and H = (Ha , Hb , Hc ) our analysis predicts\n(2\u03c0~\u03bdR )2 = (gb \u03bcB Hb )2 + (ga \u03bcB Ha + (\u22121)z \u03c0Da /2)2 +\n(gc \u03bcB Hc + (\u22121)y \u03c0Dc /2)2 ,\n(4)\n(2\u03c0~\u03bdL )2 = (gb \u03bcB Hb )2 + (ga \u03bcB Ha \u2212 (\u22121)z \u03c0Da /2)2 +\n(gc \u03bcB Hc \u2212 (\u22121)y \u03c0Dc /2)2 ,\n(5)\nObserve that while \u03bdR 6= \u03bdL for fixed chain indices (y, z),\nthese chiral ESR frequencies transform into each other\nunder lattice translations (y, z) \u2192 (y \u00b1 1, z \u00b1 1). These\nequations naturally explain the difference between H k\na, c and H k b situations. For H k b the external and\nthe internal DM field are mutually perpendicular and the\nvector sum H \u00b1 D has the the same absolute value for\nboth signs. One then finds single ESR frequency \u03bdR = \u03bdL\nof the form (1) where p\nthe gap is in fact determined by\nDM interaction, \u2206 = \u03c0 Da2 + Dc2 /2.\nFor H k a, c the DM field has a component along H\nand the frequencies of the two spin excitations are different. In principle, because of the four values of the Dy,z\nvector, four different frequencies may be present when the\nfield H is oriented within the a \u2212 c plane. We attempted\nto check this experimentally but failed to resolve separate lines within the broad band of absorption.[14] For\nH within the a \u2212 b plane (4) and (5) predict two different frequencies. Solving equations (4,5) at the fixed\nfrequency for the magnetic field we were able to fit the\nexperimental angular dependence in Fig. 3. In this way\nwe obtained Da /(4~) = 8 \u00b1 2 and Dc /(4~) = 11 \u00b1 2 GHz,\nwhich corresponds to 0.29 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.39 \u00b1 0.07 T. We\nhave to note here that for H k c the observed splitting of\nthe frequency doublet \u2206\u03bd = 0.35 T is about 50% smaller\nthan the prediction of (4,5) with these Da/c values.This\ndeviation from the predicted value is dicussed in [14].\nA more detailed comparison between the experiment\nand the theory would require extending the latter to finite temperatures since the reported measurements are\nperformed in the intermediate temperature range TN =\n0.62K < T < TCW = 4K. Temperature dependence of\nthe gap \u2206 for H k b in a wider range including TN is\nshown on Fig.1. The variation of the gap in the range\n\n1 K< T <2 K is much slower than right near TN . This\nsupports our main assumption that the reported spectral\nfeatures of Cs2 CuCl4 reflect specific spin chain physics\nwhich dominates the temperature range TN < T < TCW .\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that the uniform DM\ninteraction, which is a distinctive feature of Cs2 CuCl4 , results in a new kind of spin resonance in a S=1/2 chain antiferromagnet. The observed spectrum is a consequence\nof the splitting of the chain's spinon continuum by the\ninternal magnetic field which is produced by the uniform DM interaction. We believe that a similar phenomenon is possible in a higher-dimensional magnetic\nsystems with fractionalized spinon excitations. Our findings differ strongly from the well-known single-frequency\nresonance of S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic spin chain with\nstaggered DM interaction [10]. It also differs from a conventional 3D antiferromagnet which acquires an energy\ngap in the spectrum only below the ordering transition.\nWe would like to thank K.O.

In-chain DM\ninteraction\nDy,z = Da (\u22121)z \u00e2 + Dc (\u22121)y \u0109,\nderived in Ref. 1, describes four possible orientations of\nthe D vector on the chain with integer indices y, z, see\nFigure 1. Here y and z axes are aligned along a and\nc crystallographic axis of an orthorombic Pnma lattice,\nrespectively.\n\nFIG. 1. Parameters of spin interactions in Cs2 CuCl4 . Four\ndifferent orientations of the chain DM vector D are illustrated\nby red arrows.\n\nANGULAR DEPENDENCES OF THE\nRESONANCE FIELDS\n\nIn addition to the angular dependence of the resonance\nfield on the angle \u03c6 within the ab-plane, presented in the\nmain text, we present in Fig.2 the angular dependence of\nthe resonance field on the angle \u03c8 within the the bcplane. In this case the agreement is only qualitative:\nthe splitting at H k c, obtained by a two-Lorentzian\nfit constitutes about 50% of the predicted by the DMtheory. Nonetheless, the predicted splitting of the resonance fields is within the broad band of absorption, observed at H k c, as indicated by blue arrows in the upper\npanel of Fig. 2.\nFig.3 presents the evolution of the absorption band for\nthe field oriented within the ac-plane. According to our\ntheory (see main text) the ESR line should split into\nfour resonances, see Fig.4. We failed to resolve four lines\n\nFIG. 2. Upper panel: \u03bd = 27 GHz resonance lines for the\nmagnetic field H in the bc-plane. The curves are taken at\nthe equidistant angles.

At T = 1.3 K the splitting is\n\n\f7\n\nTEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF ESR LINES\nAT FREQUENCIES ABOVE AND BELOW THE\nGAP \u2206 FOR H k b\n\nIt was mentioned in the main text that at the frequencies below the DM gap, i.e. \u03bd < \u2206 = 14 GHz, the ESR\nline does not exhibit a shift but instead looses the intensity. This observation is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the\ndata for \u03bd = 9.63 GHz ESR signal are presented. One\ncan clearly see that the resonance field does not change\nwith lowering the temperature, while the intensity of the\nline does diminish strongly.\nTo contrast this with quite different evolution of the\nsignal at higher frequencies \u03bd > \u2206, we present in Fig.7 detailed temperature evolution of the ESR line at \u03bd = 26.9\nGHz. Here the shift of the line's center to the lower values of the resonance magnetic field is obvious. The signal\nalso broadens such that the overall intensity is conserved.\nFor other field orientations, in particular for H k a, c,\nthe ESR line completely disappears for low frequencies\n\u03bd < \u2206.\n\nTHEORETICAL DETAILS\n\nWhen H k D, unitary rotation (3) of the paper transforms chain Hamiltonian (2) into\nX p\ny\nz\nx\n] + J S\u0303xz S\u0303x+1\n+ S\u0303xy S\u0303x+1\n{ J 2 + D2 [S\u0303xx S\u0303x+1\nx\n\n\u2212g\u03bcB H S\u0303xz ,\n\no\n\n= 180\n\no\n\n= 163\n\no\n\n= 146\n\no\n\n= 129\n\no\n\n= 111\n\no\n\n= 90\n\nc\n\no\n\n= 77\n\no\n\n= 60\n\no\n\n= 43\n\no\n\n= 26\n\no\n\n= 9\n\n=26.95 GHz\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nMagnetic Field (T)\n\nFIG. 3.

However, at lower temperatures the splitting of the ESR line for H k c becomes more visible. It is\nclearly seen even at the high frequency edge of the range,\n\u03bd = 76 GHz, as is seen in Fig. 6. The splitting observed\nat T = 0.79 K equals 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 T, which corresponds satisfactory to the predicted value of 0.75 T (horizontal shift\nbetween the asymptotic parts of dashed lines in Fig.5).\nFor H k a and at T = 0.8 K, we observe similar splitting\nof 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 T for the frequency \u03bd = 72.9 GHz.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere for brevity we do not write chain's integer coordinates y, z. As claimed in the paper the obtained\nHamiltonian (1) possesses an easy-plane anisotropy of the\nstrength D2 /2J. Neglecting it takes us to the Heisenberg\nlimit discussed in the paper and illustrated in Fig.5 there.\n\nThe obtained Hamiltonian (1) can also be used to derive the low-energy form of the DM coupling.

Also\nnote that spinon velocity v in (2) is function of magnetic\nfield. It monotonically decreases with H and reaches zero\nat the saturation [4].

Here a0 is the lattice constant in units\nof which we measure coordinate x.\nComparing (3) with equation (3) of the paper we immediately observe that at low energies that unitary rotation simply corresponds to the shift of momentum by\n\u03b1 = \u2212D/J (which is exactly the physics discussed in the\nmain paper). Hence bosonic field \u03b8 of the original theory\nand \u03b8\u0303 of the rotated one are simply related as\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u0303 \u2212\n\nD\nx.\n\u03b2J\n\n(8)\n\n180\n\nAngle (deg.)\n\nv=\n\na\n\u03c3ss\n\u2032\n\u03a8R/L;s\u2032 .\n2\n\n(5)\n\nHence the low-energy theory of the original Heisenberg\nchain with uniform DM interaction can be obtained from\n(2) via (5) so that\nZ\nv\nD 2\nH = dx {(\u2202x \u03c6)2 + (\u2202x \u03b8 +\n) }=\n2\n\u03b2J\nZ\nvD\nv\n\u2202x \u03b8 + const.

These terms do not affect our\nmain result - the splitting of the ESR signal into two\ndue to the interplay of the external H and the internal\nDM D fields. They are, most likely, important for understanding the width of the individual ESR line, which is\nthe problem of much greater theoretical complexity and\nis left for future studies.\nWith the help of (7) and (9) we can now write down\nthe low-energy Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg chain subject to both Zeeman and DM interactions acting along\ndifferent directions,\nZ\nHchain = H0 \u2212 dx g\u03bcB H(MRh + MLh ) +\nZ\n\u2212 dx (vD/J)(MRd \u2212 MLd )\n(10)\nwhere Hamiltonian H0 of the ideal Heisenberg chain is\nwritten in Sugawara form [3] as\nZ\n2\u03c0v\nH0 =\ndx {MR * MR + ML * ML }\n(11)\n3\nTo connect with previous expressions, it is worth noting\nthat (11) is in fact equivalent to the abelian bosonization form (2).

Above that temperature a more conventional semiclassical description of the spin-1/2 chain in terms of\nfluctuating N\u00e9el vector order parameter field is valid [7].\nIn fact, one can think of T0 scale as of 'Haldane' temperature below which the difference between integer and\nhalf-integer spin chains becomes pronounced. It is the\ntemperature (or, equivalently, energy) scale below which\nthe true spinon nature of the quantum ground state of\nthe critical spin-1/2 chain is manifest.\nNote that upper indices d and h on currents MR/L\nin (10) denote directions of the vectors D and H.

It seems physically sensible to think that\ntheir ESR response is paramagnetic and not sensitive to\nthe low-energy effects due to the internal DM field. It is\nthis response that is measured at \u03bd < \u03bdb,min in Fig. 7.\nAccording to this argument the intensity of the paramagnetic part of the signal should diminish with lowering\nT, simply following diminishing of the population of thermal spinons, in agreement with our observation in Fig. 7.\nThe higher-frequency response (\u03bd > \u03bdb,min ) is instead the\nintrinsic property of the spin chain.\n\nFIG. 7.

Lower panel: set of 26.92 GHz ESR lines at different temperatures for H k b. The narrow resonance at \u223c 0.9\nT is the DPPH signal.\n\nThis is just equation (1) of the main paper (see also discussion following equations (4,5) there). This equation\nclearly states that there is a minimal ESR frequency,\ngiven by \u03bdb,min = \u2206/(2\u03c0~) = D/(4~), below which\nno resonance is possible in this geometry. Experimentally the resonance is observed both above and below\n\u03bdb,min , but with markedly different temperature dependencies. The low-frequency (\u03bd < \u03bdb,min ) response remains paramagnetic-like and quickly looses intensity on\nlowering T , see Figure 7. On the contrary, the highfrequency response (Figure 7) follows prediction (14)\nrather nicely, as detailed in the main text.\nWe'd like to argue that the observed difference is a\nfinite-T effect. Eq. (14) describes idealized T = 0 situation of completely decoupled spin chains, to which\nCs2 CuCl4 is only an approximation in the intermediate temperature window between T0 discussed above and\nthe ordering temperature TN . In this temperature interval one expects sizable thermal population of spinons at\n\nIt is easy to extend this argument to other field directions. Let, for example, H k a: then according to equation (5) of the paper we can achieve the situation when\nga \u03bcB Ha = \u03c0Da /2 and 2\u03c0~\u03bdR (z = odd) = 2\u03c0~\u03bdL (z =\neven) = \u03c0D\npc /2, while 2\u03c0~\u03bdR (z = even) = 2\u03c0~\u03bdL (z =\nodd) = \u03c0 Dc2 + 4Da2 /2. Thus in this case \u03bda,min =\nDc /(4~) and this condition is realized for 1/2 of chains\nin the system. Similar argument shows that for H k c\nthe minimal resonance frequency is \u03bdc,min = Da /(4~).\nTo reiterate, below the corresponding minimal resonance\nfrequency we expect standard paramagnetic ESR signal\ndue to thermally excited population of spinons, and the\nintensity of such a signal should decrease with lowering\nof the temperature.\nIt is interesting to note that there is one 'magic' orientation of the external field for which \u03bdmin = 0. This\nhappens for ga \u03bcB Ha = \u03c0Da /2, Hb = 0 and gc \u03bcB Hc =\n\u03c0Dc /2, in which case 1/4 of the chains experiences zero\ntotal field. It would be interesting to study this special\norientation in more details in the future.\n\npovarov@kapitza.ras.ru\n[1] O. A. Starykh, H. Katsura, L. Balents, Phys. Rev. B82,\n014421 (2010).\n[2] S.
