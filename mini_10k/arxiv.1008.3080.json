The entanglement would undergo decoherence due to the unavoidable interaction with the environment.\nAs a result, an initially entangled two-qubit system becomes totally disentangled after evolving for a finite time. This phenomena is called entanglement sudden death (ESD)[3] and\nhas been recently demonstrated experimentally[4].\nMany works are devoted to the ESD of the qubits coupled to an environment that results\nin irreversible loss, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the interaction\nof the qubits with the field[3, 5]. The effect of the counter-rotating terms on the ESD has\nbeen less studied, even for the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model[6] where the qubit interacting\nonly with the single-cavity mode. In fact, some investigations have also focused on the\nstoring of entanglement in such a system[7]. So entanglement dynamics for two independent\nJC atoms is also of fundamental interest, and has been well studied only in the RWA[8\u201311].\nOn the other hand, the JC model is also closely related to condensed matter physics\nrecently. It can be realized in some solid-state systems recently, such as one Josephson\ncharge qubit coupling to an electromagnetic resonator [12], the superconducting quantum\ninterference device coupled with a nanomechanical resonator[13, 14], and the most recently\nLC resonator magnetically coupled to a superconducting qubit[15]. In conventional quantum\noptics, the coupling between the two-level \"natural\" atom and the single bosonic mode is\nquite weak, RWA has been usually employed. With the progress of the fabrication, the\nartificial atoms may interact very strongly with on-chip resonant circuits[12\u201315], RWA can\nnot describe well the strong coupling regime[16]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore\nthe entanglement dynamics for two independent JC atoms without RWA.\nHowever, due to the consideration of the counter-rotating terms, the photon number is\nnot conserved, so the photonic Fock space has infinite dimensions, any solution without\nRWA is highly nontrivial. In the recent years, several non-RWA approaches[16\u201321] has been\nproposed in a few contexts. Especially, by using extended bosonic coherent states, three of\nthe present authors and a collaborator have solved the Dicke model without RWA exactly\nin the numerical sense[17].\n2\n\n\fIn this paper, we employ a numerically exact technique to solve JC model without RWA\nby means of extended bosonic coherent states. The correlations among bosons are added\nstep by step until further corrections will not change the results. All eigenfunctions and\neigenvalues can be obtained exactly. Based on the exact solutions to the single JC model,\nwe can study the entanglement evolution of two JC atoms easily. Analytical results without\nRWA based on an unitary transformation are also presented. The paper is organized as\nfollows. In Sec.II, the numerically exact solution to the JC model is proposed in detail\nand analytical results in terms of unitary transformation are also provided. The numerical\nresults and discussions are given in Sec.III. The brief summary is presented finally in the\nlast section.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL HAMILTONIAN\n\nThe JC model can be written in the basis\nspin-up and the second denoting spin-down\nHJC =\n\n\u0010\n\n|\u2191i , |\u2193i\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere the first index denoting\n\n\u2206\n\u03c3z + \u03c9a+ a + \u03bb(a + a+ )\u03c3x\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a+ and a are the bosonic annihilation and creation operators of the cavity, \u2206 and\n\u03c9 are the frequencies of the atom and cavity, g is the atom-cavity coupling constant, and\n\u03c3k (k = x, y, z) is the Pauli matrix of the two-level atoms. Here we set h\u0304 = 1. The detuning\nis defined as \u03b4 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u2206.\nIn this paper, we describe two approaches to solve the single JC model without RWA.\nOne is the numerically exact approach in terms of extended bosonic coherent states, the\nother is an analytical approach based on a unitary transformation.\nNumerically exact approach.\u2013 In order to facilitate the calculation, we use a transformed\nHamiltonian with a rotation around the y\u2212axis by an angle \u03c0/4, so \u03c3z \u2192 \u03c3x , \u03c3x \u2192 \u2212\u03c3z .\nThis rotation can also be described formally by the following transformation,\n\u2032\nHJC\n= V HJC V + = \u2212\n\nwhere\n\n\u2206\n\u03c3x + \u03c9a+ a + \u03bb(a + a+ )\u03c3z ,\n2\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 1\n1\n\uf8f8,\nV =\u221a \uf8ed\n2 \u22121 1\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fBy introducing the new operators\nA = a + g, B = a \u2212 g, g = \u03bb/\u03c9,\n\n(3)\n\nwe can observe that the linear term for the bosonic operator is removed, and only the number\noperators A+ A and B + B are left. Therefore the wavefunction can be expanded in terms of\nthese new operators as\n\uf8ebP\n\nNtr\nn=0 c1n\nPNtr\nn=0 c2n\n\n|\u03c6\u2032 (t)i = \uf8ed\n\nFor A operator, we have\n\n|niA\n|niB\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(4)\n\nAn\n(a + g/\u03c9)n\n\u221a\n|niA = \u221a |0iA =\n|0iA .\nn!\nn!\n\n(5)\n\nThe property of B operator is the same.\nThe Hamiltonian (2) remains unchanged under the transformation level 1 \u2192 level 2 and\n\na+ (or a) \u2192 \u2212a+ (or \u2212a). So we can set c2n = \u00b1(\u22121)n c1n (or c1n = \u00b1(\u22121)n c2n ).

G = 2g. The corresponding right\nfigures are the bird's-eye view.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe first study the evolution of the concurrence for atom-atom entanglement for two JC\natoms without RWA when the states are initiated with the given Bell states (\u03b1 is fixed) (\n(15). Actually, the dynamics of entanglement in bipartite quantum systems is sensitive to\ninitial conditions[3, 23]\nWe consider the two same JC atoms for zero detuning. The concurrence for atom-atom\nentanglement as a function of time can be calculated with the use of Eqs. (13) and (14).\nAs show in Fig. 1(a), for small G = 2g, the concurrence evolve as cos2 (Gt/2), just follow\nthat in RWA [8] for Bell state 1. For G above 0.5, entanglement can drop to zero, which can\nnot happen in the two JC atoms in RWA for Bell state 1. The entanglement can be revival\nirregularly. JC model is just N = 1 Dicke model. We attribute this aperiodic entanglement\nevolution to the quantum chaos in finite Dicke model[24]. Without RWA, the system is\nintegral, the emergency of the quantum chaos is impossible, so regular behavior is always\nobserved[8, 10].\nIt is interesting that the area of the ESD become larger with increasing G. At very large\ncoupling constant, the revival of entanglement will not happen, in sharp contrast with those\nobserved in the RWA. Without RWA, the rule of the transfer of entanglement between the\ntwo-qubit subsystems derived in [9\u201311] may not hold due to presence of the counter-rotating\n8\n\n\fCAB\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nCAB\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\n4\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The concurrence for atom-atom entanglement with the initial atomic Bell\nstate 1 (upper panel) and the Bell state 2 (down panel).

The\ncorresponding right figures are the bird's-eye view.\n\nterms. Without RWA, we argue that there is no entanglement invariant because the photon\nnumber is not conserved.\nFor Bell state 2, the ESD can happen even in the RWA[8]. Without RWA, for small G,\nthe entanglement dynamics show the same behavior. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the area of the\nESD become larger with increasing G, and more wider than that in Bell state 1.\nAs we know, for weak coupling between the atom and the single bosonic mode, the RWA\n\n9\n\n\fis a good approximation, the non-RWA treatment is not necessary. Our results for the entanglement dynamics also provide a evidence for this point. However, for strong coupling\ncase, the entanglement dynamics demonstrate that the non-RWA should be considered essentially. As the new progress in the fabrication, some artificial atoms are just strongly\ncoupled with the bosonic field.\nThe non-RWA JC model can be also treated by the unitary transformation approach.\nIs this approach really good enough in the strong coupling regime? We now present the\nanalytical results based on this approach for zero detunning according to Eqs. (25) and (29),\nwhich are shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding numerically exact ones are also exhibited for\ncomparison. It is obvious that the analytical results essentially deviate from the exact ones at\ng = 0.1. Recent experiments on the LC resonator coupled to a flux qubit demonstrated that\nthe system operates in the ultra-strong coupling regime g = 0.1 [15], which crosses the limit\nof validity for RWA in the JC model. Since the analysis based on a unitary transformation\ncould not essentially change the RWA results, the present numerically exact results are more\nnecessary.\nWe next consider the two JC atoms with different atom-cavity coupling for zero detuning.\nWithout loss of generality, we choose g1 = 2g2 . The concurrence for atom-atom entanglement\nas a function of time can also be calculated with the use of Eqs. (13) and (14). As shown\nin Fig. 3(a), for small G, the concurrence evolve as cos2 (Gt/2), following that in RWA [8]\nfor Bell state 1. As G increases, entanglement can drop to zero and is almost not recovered,\nquite different from that in the two same JC atoms. We argue that two JC atoms with\ndifferent coupling strength suppress the atom-atom entanglement. This point is confirmed\nby the evolution of the initial Bell state 2 as indicated in Fig. 3(b). No matter whether\nRWA is taken into account or not, the area of the ESD in the evolution of the initial Bell\nstate 2 is larger than that in initial Bell state 1.\nFor more detail, we study the effect of the coupling strength on evolution of the concurrence for atom-atom entanglement. Without loss of generality, we only consider the two\nsame JC atoms. As exhibited in Figs. 4 and 5, for weak coupling g1 < 10\u22123 , no ESD is\nobserved. For g1 > 10\u22123 , the ESD appear, and its area is enlarged with g. At the same\ntime, the periodicity of the entanglement evolution is destroyed.\nOne natural question is what the mechanism is for the ESD in two remote JC models.\nThe photons should influence the atomic state considerably. We then calculate the average\n10\n\n\f1\n\n\u2212CAB\n\n\u03b1/\u03c0\n\n0\n0.5\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n\u03b1/\u03c0\n\n\u22120.6\n0.5\n\u22120.8\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\nGt/\u03c0\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Histogram of the concurrence for atom-atom entanglement with the initial\nBell state 1.

To show its role in the entanglement dynamics, we\nplot the average photon number together with entanglement for two limit coupling cases\ng = 0.001 and 1 in Fig. 6 with initial Bell state 1 and Fig. 7 with initial Bell state 2. It is\nvery interesting that the curves for the entanglement and the average photon number always\nshow opposite behavior.

[10] that the atom-atom entanglement in RWA usually increases with ratio between\ndetuning and coupling constant |\u03b4| /g and is irrelevant with the sign of detuning. In other\nwords, the entanglement decreases with g for given detuning. Without RWA, it is not that\ncase. After the unitary transformation, we have the renormalized JC Hamiltonian Eq. (20)\nin a RWA type. So entanglement evolution depends on |\u03b4ef f |, which is related to both the\nmagnitude and the sign of original detuning |\u03b4| shown in Eq. (21). By Eqs. (22) and (23),\nthe effective coupling constant can also be expressed as gef f = 2g/ [1 + 1/ (1 \u2212 \u03b4/\u03c9)] if the\ncounter rotating-wave terms are taken into account after the unitary transformation. It\nfollows that gef f decreases with |\u03b4| for positive detuning and increases with |\u03b4| for negative detuning. So in the strong coupling regime where the counter rotating-wave terms is\nrequired, the effect of detuning is very sensitive to the sign of detuning. The above discussions should be also suited qualitatively to the numerical exact results. We calculate the\nentanglement evolution of the initial Bell states 1 and 2 as a function of detuning. The\nresults for different coupling constants ranging from weak to strong coupling regime are list\nin Fig. 8. The entanglement evolution is symmetric with detuning for the weak coupling\nand becomes asymmetric with the increase of the coupling constant. In the weak coupling\nregime, as shown in the left column, the entanglement increase with the value of detuning,\nand independent of the sign, similar to those in RWA. With the increase of the coupling,\nit is however observed that the entanglement decreases with the magnitude of the positive\ndetuning, and increases with the magnitude of the minus detuning, in contrast to the case of\nRWA. In the strong coupling regime, the positive detuning stabilizes the entanglement and\nfacilitates its revival, whereas the negative detuning suppresses the entanglement, facilitates\nits death, and reduces the period of entanglement revival.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, based on the exact solution for the single JC atoms, we are able to calculate\nexactly the entanglement evolution of the two independent JC atoms without RWA. The\nresults are essentially different from RWA cases in the strong coupling regime. The analytical\nresults based on an unitary transformation are also given. It can modify the RWA results\nand could not provide an essentially different ones.

The present numerically exact calculations for the non-RWA model\nshow that the ESD could not be avoided, and the periodicity of entanglement evolution is\ndestroyed by the presence of additional photons. We also suggest that the photons may\nsuppress the entanglement and is just the origin of the ESD. The effect of the detunning on\nthe entanglement evolution is also investigated. It is observed that the sign of detunning\nplay a essential role in the strong coupling regime. The present theoretical prediction would\nbe tested in a experimental study of ESD where the artificial atoms are made of circuit\nQED[12\u201315] if operating in the ultra-strong coupling regime.\n\n14\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China and National\nBasic Research Program of China (Grant Nos. 2011CB605903 and 2009CB929104).\n\n[1] A.
