For all asteroid observations we analysed in detail the dark current, the calibration reference flashes, the space environment\neffects (glitches), memory effects, tracking influences, and various other sources of uncertainty. We performed a refined reduction\nof all measurements, corrected for the various effects, and re-calibrated the data. We outline the data reduction process and give an\noverview of the available data and the quality of the observations. We apply a thermophysical model to the flux measurements to\nderive far-IR based diameter and albedo values of the asteroids. The measured thermal rotational lightcurve of (4) Vesta is compared\nto model predictions.\nResults. The catalogue of LWS (Long Wavelength Spectrometer) observations of asteroids contains 57 manually reduced datasets,\nincluding seven non-standard observations, which as such did not have final pipeline products available before. In total, the archive\nnow contains 11 spectral scans and 46 fixed grating measurements with a simultaneous observation at 10 key wavelengths distributed\nover the full LWS range. The new data products are now accessible via the ISO data archive as highly processed data products\n(HPDP)\u22c6\u22c6 .\nConclusions. The quality of the data products was checked against state-of-the-art thermophysical model predictions and an excellent\nagreement was found. The absolute photometric accuracy is better than 10 %. The calibrated spectra will serve as source for future\nmineralogical studies of dwarf planets and dwarf planet candidates.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe Infrared Space Observatory (ISO; Kessler et al. 1996)\nobserved between 1995 and 1998 more than 40 asteroids in\ngreat detail, including some complete spectra from 2 to 200 \u03bcm\nand large samples of photometric measurements (M\u00fcller 2003;\nDotto et al. 2002). The main goals of the about 100 hours of\nasteroid observing time were the identification of surface minerals, composition, connection to meteorites and comets, surface alteration processes, and the interpretation of taxonomic\nclasses through the identification of mid-infrared features of\nwell-known minerals and meteorites. M\u00fcller et al. (2005) summarised the main ISO results from the various solar system programmes and from all four ISO instruments.\nThe ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS; Clegg et al.\n1996) performed photometric and spectroscopic measurements\nin the wavelength range 43 to 197 \u03bcm and opened, together with\nISOPHOT, a new window for far-infrared astronomy. The details\non the instrument and the data processing can be found in the\nSend offprint requests to: F.

In total, the ISO\nData Archive (IDA1 ) contains 51 successful LWS observations\nof four different asteroids covering almost 18 hours of satellite\ntime. However, the scientific return of these programmes was so\nfar very little. Most of the scientific questions could not be answered mainly due to the instrumental artefacts which remained\nin the archived data products.\nThe LWS data set of asteroid observations covers a wavelength range which is not accessible from the ground. In the near\nfuture the Herschel mission will be capable of obtaining asteroid spectra between 57 and 210 \u03bcm with PACS (Photodetector\nArray Camera & Spectrometer) and between 200 and 670 \u03bcm\nwith SPIRE (Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver), but\nasteroids are currently not part of the accepted key programmes.\nAlthough the ISO target list is very limited, it includes objects\nof high scientific interest: (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta are the targets\nof the Dawn2 spacecraft mission, (1) Ceres is meanwhile considered as a dwarf-planet, and (2) Pallas, (4) Vesta, and (10) Hygiea\nare dwarf-planet candidates3 .

Hormuth and T. G. M\u00fcller: Catalogue of ISO LWS observations of asteroids\n\nlargest bodies in the main-belt are protoplanets remaining intact\nsince their formation.\nThe LWS observations comprise spectral energy distributions over the full wavelength range between 43 and 197 \u03bcm with\na spectral resolving power of \u223c 200 and can be utilised to search\nfor spectral signatures related to the asteroids' mineralogic composition. An overview of the spectroscopic features from theory\nand lab measurements in the infrared wavelength regime up to\n25 \u03bcm can be found in e.g. Salisbury (1993) and in the context\nof ISO in Dotto et al. (2002). Far infrared laboratory spectra of\nvarious crystalline and amorphous minerals are digitally available e.g. in the Heidelberg \u2013 Jena \u2013 St.Petersburg \u2013 Database of\nOptical Constants (HJPDOC)4 (Henning et al. 1999). Although\nthese measurements are in principle sufficient to allow the analysis of the data presented in this paper, their application to solid\nsurfaces with non-uniform grain sizes and subsurface radiation is\nnot straightforward, rendering a mineralogic interpretation difficult.\nApart from that, the LWS observations can give valuable input to models describing the thermal emission of minor bodies in\nour own or other solar systems, and are key ingredients to establish asteroids as calibration objects in the middle and far infrared\n(e.g. M\u00fcller & Lagerros 1998, 2002).\nAn effort was made to produce a homogeneously reduced set\nof these observations, eventually leading to a catalogue which is\navailable through the IDA. We describe the contents of the catalogue (Section 2), outline the data reduction process, and give an\noverview of the instrumental artefacts (Section 3) encountered\nduring catalogue compilation. Section 4 gives a brief overview\nof the catalogue structure. In Section 5 we discuss the quality\nof the final products, present diameter and albedo values derived\nfrom thermal IR data in the range 43\u2013197\u03bcm for the observed\nasteroids, and analyse the thermal lightcurve of (4) Vesta.\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. Overview\n\nMost of the LWS asteroid observations were carried out in fixed\ngrating mode, using the astronomical observing template (AOT)\nL02. This produced ten photometric measurements \u2013 one in\neach detector \u2013 at 46.2 \u03bcm, 56.2 \u03bcm, 66.1 \u03bcm, 75.7 \u03bcm, 84.8 \u03bcm,\n102.4 \u03bcm, 141.8 \u03bcm, 160.6 \u03bcm, and 178.0 \u03bcm (corresponding to\ndetectors SW1 to SW5 and LW1 to LW5).\nOnly four full grating scans using the template L01 were performed, covering the whole spectral range from 43 to 197 \u03bcm\nwith typical SNRs of 20\u201330 for (10) Hygiea and 150\u2013200 for\n(1) Ceres. The spectrum is composed of ten sub-spectra with the\nsub-spectra being generated by the grating scanning over the ten\nLWS detectors simultaneously. Signal-to-noise was built up by\ntaking more than one scan.\nAdditionally there exist 25 observations carried out in the\nnon-standard engineering mode L99, most of them similar to\nL01 grating scans (SNR \u2248150 for (1) Ceres and \u2248100 for (4)\nVesta). For the catalogue, only L99 on-source grating scans were\nconsidered, and no background measurements are included. The\nnon-standard observations are characterised by experimental settings of the detector parameters (bias voltages and heater currents), an unusually high spectral sampling (13 samples per resolution element instead of four, as it was the standard setting\nlater), and longer integration times per grating position.\nFrom the available L99 observations we selected seven\ndatasets for inclusion in this catalogue. The spectral analysis\n4\n\nhttp://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/HJPDOC/\n\nof this data still remains difficult, since the relative spectral response function (RSRF) of the detectors used in the calibration\nprocess is based on observations performed in the standard L01\nmode. The remaining L99 data sets did not include sufficient calibration data for reliable dark current determination.\nAll standard observations are listed in Tbl. 1, while the nonstandard observations are summarised in Tbl. 2. Contamination\nby 158 \u03bcm CII background emission is indicated where applicable.\nA comprehensive overview of the instrument design, observing modes, and detector properties can be found in the LWS\nhandbook (Gry et al. 2003).\n2.2. Observation elements\n\nEach observation consists not only of flux measurements of the\ntarget itself, but also includes calibration data, typically split in\ntwo blocks at begin and end. By placing the Fabry-Per\u00f3t spectrometer into the beam and intentionally misaligning the etalons,\nlight from the source did not reach the detectors, eventually resulting in a dark current measurement. Long observations, and\nespecially the engineering mode L99 data, contain intermittent\nadditional dark current measurements.\nSince the responsivity of the detectors is not constant, but\nusually drifting upwards over time due to impacts of charged\nparticles, the actual responsivity of each detector had to be determined for each observation separately. This was done by flashing the detectors with internal illuminators while light from the\nsource was again blocked with the Fabry-Per\u00f3t. This allowed to\nquantify responsivity changes during the course of a single observation, and to apply the so-called 'responsivity drift correction'.\nAbsolute responsivity calibration was performed by comparing the responsivities measured at the time of the observation to\nthe ones measured during observations of Uranus, the primary\nLWS calibrator.\nFor the target source flux measurements, the Fabry-Per\u00f3t was\nremoved from the beam. Depending on the observation template\nand requested wavelength coverage, the grating remained either\nat a fixed angle or was moved to scan the desired spectral range.\nThis could be done in unidirectional mode, where the grating angle constantly in- or decreased and was reset to its start position\nbefore each scan repetition. Alternatively, the observation could\nbe performed in bidirectional mode, with the grating angle increasing and then decreasing with the same rate during the measurement. This is referred to as up- and down-scan, where 'up'\nand 'down' does not correspond to an increase or decrease of the\nobserved wavelength, but of the grating position encoder value.\nIn fact, during an upscan the observing wavelength decreased,\nand increased during downscans.\n\n3. Data reduction\n3.1. Instrumental artefacts\n\nThe most prominent artefacts, common to all ISO instruments,\nare 'glitches', sudden increases of the measured flux due to\ncharged particles hitting a detector or parts of the readout electronics. The initial sudden signal increase is sometimes followed\nby a 'glitch tail', a long-lived exponential decay. Though glitches\ncan be recognised and filtered out automatically to some extent,\nglitch remnants are present in all observations throughout the\narchive, regardless of instrument or observing mode. Glitches do\nnot only occur during object flux measurements, but also during\n\n\fF. Hormuth and T. G. M\u00fcller: Catalogue of ISO LWS observations of asteroids\n\n3\n\nthe calibration, i.e. dark current and responsivity measurements,\nand adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of the actual\nobservation. Special attention was therefore put on the manual\nremoval of glitch remnants in each observation contained in the\npresented catalogue.\nOther frequently observed instrumental artefacts are fringes\nin the spectra in the case of extended sources or off-axis observations, spurious spectral features due to uncertainties in the\nspectral response function used in the calibration process, and\nmemory effects, i.e. changes of detector response depending on\nthe illumination history.\nObservations towards the end of the satellite mission were\naffected by so-called 'warm-up effects', visible as broad spectral\nfeatures in some detectors. This was presumably caused by periodic breaks of the liquid helium film in the vicinity of the LWS\nstrap location as the satellite's helium tank came close to exhaustion. From the observations contained in this catalogue, this\naffects one L01 type observation of (1) Ceres taken in December\n1997, several months before ISO's liquid helium depletion in\nApril 1998.\nA thorough description of caveats and unexpected effects\nconcerning LWS data can be found in Chapter 6 of the LWS\nhandbook (Gry et al. 2003). All datasets included in this catalogue were checked for the presence of the artefacts described\nabove and data quality was quantified via a set of well-defined\nflags. The criteria for setting these flags and the results of this\nquality check can be found in the technical documentation accompanying the catalogue (Hormuth & M\u00fcller 2006).\n\nartefacts in the calibration data will affect the accuracy and reliability of the whole observation. The LIA routine SHORT AAL was\nused to create ISAP-compatible output spectra in the LWS AutoAnalysis format, and to convert to W/cm2 /\u03bcm, the flux unit used\nfor all LWS observations. This routine automatically strips all\ncalibration data and leaves only the basic information needed for\nfurther scientific analysis, e.g. wavelength, flux, detector number, and scan direction.\nIn the case of photometric L02 observations, the data was\nnow averaged per detector to create the final FITS product.\nIn the case of grating scans a first round of manual deglitching was performed, probably the most time consuming step\nin the reduction process. Relative responsivity correction was\nachieved by comparing the mean flux in each detector and scan\nto the mean flux level of all scans together. The derived gains\nwere then used to bring all scans to the same flux level \u2013 separately for each detector and scan direction.\nAfter fine-zapping of remaining glitches, the data was averaged per detector with a bin width of typically 0.06 \u03bcm, corresponding to an oversampling of four with respect to the spectral\nresolution. In the case of bidirectional scans the data was now averaged over the scan directions. Especially at longer wavelengths\nsome spectra clearly showed fringing, probably caused by background emission. The affected detectors were defringed within\nISAP, using only the averaged spectrum for fringe detection and\ndefringing to get the best possible signal-to-noise for the fringe\nfitting (in the case of bidirectional data).\n\n3.2. Data reduction steps\n\n4. Data products and access to the catalogue\n\nData reduction was performed with the available standard reduction packages LIA (LWS Interactive Analysis) Version 10.2 and\nISAP (ISO Spectral Analysis Package) Version 2.2. Additional\nown IDL-procedures were used for manual editing of the data at\nthe SPD (Standard Processed Data) level, and the generation of\nthe final FITS and ASCII files. The SPD data is preprocessed in\nthe sense that raw detector readouts have been converted into\nphotocurrents, saturated readouts flagged, and strong glitches\nautomatically identified and removed. Housekeeping data not\nnecessary for further data reduction has been removed, but dark\ncurrent and responsivity measurements have been preserved. In\nthe following we briefly outline the order of reduction steps and\ngive the names of the corresponding LIA procedures where applicable.\nIn a first step, the pointing coordinates of each observation\nwere checked against the ephemeris of the observed asteroid to\ndetect pointing problems. The maximum difference between asteroid position and telescope pointing was found to be 2.\u2032\u2032 5, much\nsmaller than the LWS beam profile (see Lloyd 2003). The reduction process started at SPD level with a visual inspection\nof the data in the time domain. Photometric L02 observations\nwere manually de-glitched at this stage, capturing minor glitches\nnot automatically flagged during generation of the SPD data.\nThe available pipeline data of grating scans was additionally inspected with ISAP to get a quick overview of the available scans\nand scan directions.\nNext, dark current determination and subtraction were performed using the LIA routine IA DARK, followed by the absolute responsivity correction with IA ABSCORR. These interactive\nroutines allow visual inspection and manual editing of the dark\ncurrent measurements and the internal calibration source observations. Deglitching of this data and the removal of measurements obviously affected by memory effects is critical, since any\n\nThe ISO Data Archive (IDA)5 contains spectroscopic, imaging,\nphotometric, and polarimetric measurements of more than 40\ndifferent asteroids at wavelengths between 2 and 240\u03bcm. A versatile Java based web-interface allows to extract observational\ndata in various formats, ranging from unprocessed raw data, over\nstandard pipeline processed measurements up to manually reprocessed high quality data products.\nAll data files associated to this catalogue can be retrieved\nby searching for the specific TDT6 number of a measurement\nas given in Tbl. 1 and 2, by searching for all LWS observations\nof a given asteroid, or by searching for LWS asteroid observations in general. The highly processed data products, including\noverview plots, quality flags, and catalogue documentation can\nbe obtained via the HPDP button left to each entry in the search\nresult window of the archive interface.\nThe catalogue documentation (Hormuth & M\u00fcller 2006), giving\na thorough description of the data reduction steps, is also separately available from the list of all HPDP data sets7 .\nIn Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we show logarithmic example plots for\nall observing modes. Different colours have been chosen to allow distinguishment of overlapping measurements by different\ndetectors. The error bars in Fig. 1 include measurement and\ncalibration errors, incuding a 5% uncertainty attributed to the\nUranus models used for absolute flux calibration. The slight mismatches between measurements from different detectors at same\nwavelengths in Fig. 2 are caused by memory effects of individual\ndetectors.\nThe data sets are available both as FITS tables, compatible with the ISAP software package, and as plain ASCII ta5\n6\n7\n\nAccessible via http://iso.esac.esa.int\n\"Target Dedicated Time\", a unique identifier for ISO observations\nhttp://iso.esac.esa.int/ida/hpdp.php\n\n\f4\n\nF.

The photometry of the LW4 and LW5 detectors is less reliable due to dark\ncurrent problems.\n\n5.1. Quality of the catalogue products\n\nIn order to study the reliability of the photometric L02 data in\nthe catalogue, we compared the measured flux with predictions\ncalculated by means of the thermophysical model (TPM; e.g.\nLagerros 1998, and references therein). For Tbl. 3 we calculated\nmodel fluxes for the specified targets and epochs and analysed\nthe observation-to-model ratios. Measurements affected by detector warm-up artefacts or abnormally high dark current were\nnot included in this quality check.\nThe general agreement between the photometric observations (L02) and models (Tbl. 3) is better than 5 % for Ceres,\nPallas, and Vesta and better than 30 % for Hygiea. The higher\nuncertainties are due to dark current effects at the low flux levels. The discrepancy for Hygiea is not surprising. Due to the\nlack of suitable good quality thermal data the thermophysical\nmodel parameters are also very poor, and Hygiea is considered\nas a low quality far-IR calibrator (M\u00fcller & Lagerros 1998). As\na rule of thumb, the absolute flux error is better than 10% for\ntargets brighter than about 10 Jy.\n\n100\n150\nWavelength / \u03bcm\n\n\u03bb\n[\u03bcm]\n\n(1) Ceres\n11 Obs.\nObs/Mod\n\n(2) Pallas\n4 Obs.\nObs/Mod\n\n(4) Vesta\n14 Obs.\nObs/Mod\n\n(10) Hygiea\n2 Obs.\nObs/Mod\n\n46.4\n56.4\n66.3\n75.9\n85.0\n102.9\n122.7\n142.2\n161.0\n178.4\n\n1.04\u00b10.05\n1.01\u00b10.03\n1.04\u00b10.02\n1.02\u00b10.03\n1.01\u00b10.04\n1.09\u00b10.04\n0.96\u00b10.05\n0.89\u00b10.04\n0.99\u00b10.05\n1.01\u00b10.10\n\n1.00\u00b10.02\n1.06\u00b10.02\n1.10\u00b10.04\n1.02\u00b10.03\n1.02\u00b10.11\n1.13\u00b10.04\n0.95\u00b10.03\n0.84\u00b10.07\n0.99\u00b10.04\n-\n\n1.02\u00b10.04\n1.01\u00b10.04\n1.02\u00b10.04\n1.04\u00b10.04\n1.00\u00b10.07\n1.24\u00b10.06\n1.07\u00b10.05\n1.10\u00b10.11\n-\n-\n\n1.21\u00b10.05\n1.25\u00b10.10\n1.23\u00b10.15\n1.24\u00b10.12\n1.39\u00b10.10\n1.40\u00b10.26\n1.30\u00b10.07\n1.33\u00b10.04\n-\n-\n\nMean\n\n1.01\u00b10.05\n\n1.03\u00b10.08\n\n1.05\u00b10.08\n\n1.27\u00b10.14\n\nThe high quality of the spectral scans can be seen in the\nsmooth and well-connected curves of the archive browse images\n\n\fF. Hormuth and T. G. M\u00fcller: Catalogue of ISO LWS observations of asteroids\n\n(see Fig. 2). For mineralogic studies it might still be useful to\ninvestigate the up- and down-scans separately to confirm that\ncertain low-level, broad-band structures in the scans are reliable\nor not. Low level features extending over two or more detectors\nas well as structures close to pronounced RSRF changes have\nto be analysed carefully: the detectors are not always behaving\nin exactly the same way and LWS should be considered as 10\nindividual spectrometers, one per detector.\n5.2. Diameter and albedo calculations\n\nDirect size measurements, even for the large main-belt asteroids,\nare still difficult. Up to now, only a small sample has been resolved via imaging techniques from space (HST, see Dotto et al.\n(2002) and references therein) and adaptive optics techniques\nfrom large ground-based telescopes (e.g. Marchis et al. 2006).\nOccultation observations performed by well-organised groups\nof amateur astronomers also reveal direct sizes, expressed in\nchord maps which represent the cross section of the asteroid\nat the time of the occultation (e.g. Millis & Dunham 1989)\nor http://www.psi.edu/pds/resource/occ.html for more recent results). But the largest number of asteroid sizes are originating\nfrom thermal infrared observations (e.g. Tedesco et al. 2002a,b)\nvia radiometric methods i.e., an indirect method which relies on\nmodel assumptions.\nWe used a well-established thermophysical model (TPM;\nLagerros 1996, 1997, 1998) to derive absolute effective sizes and\nalbedos for our 4 asteroids from the new L02 data sets.\nThis model allows to use state-of-the-art shape models together with corresponding spin axis solutions derived from\nlightcurve inversion techniques (e.g. Kaasalainen et al. 2002).\nAs part of the energy equation for the asteroids the amount of\nreflected sunlight is described via the H\u2212G magnitude system\n(Bowell et al. 1989). The rest of the solar energy is absorbed and\nre-emitted as thermal emission. Knowing the solar insolation together with the disk-integrated thermal emission allows then to\nsolve the energy equation for the asteroid's effective size and\nalbedo (e.g. Harris & Lagerros 2002). The true illumination and\nobserving geometries are taken into account in the TPM calculations. The surface roughness is described by the r.m.s. values\nof the surface slopes (\u03c1) and the fraction of the surface covered\nby craters (f). For the surface roughness, as well as for the thermal properties to calculate the heat conduction into lower layers of the surface, we used \"default properties\" (\u03c1=0.7, f=0.6,\n\u0393=15 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121 ) as described by M\u00fcller et al. (1999). The\nemissivity models were taken from M\u00fcller & Lagerros (1998):\na standard wavelength-dependent emissivity model for Ceres,\nPallas, ad Hygiea and a special one for Vesta where lower emissivities in the submm/mm range were found.\nThe TPM with the \"default thermal properties\" has been tested\nand validated extensively in the context of ISO for large,\nregolith-covered main-belt-asteroids (M\u00fcller & Lagerros 2002).\nIt is worth to note here that the surface roughness and heat conduction properties are less important for our far-IR analysis since\nthey mainly influence the mid-IR radiation at the Wien-part of\nthe spectral energy distribution (e.g. M\u00fcller 2002, Figs. 2&3).\nAsteroid-specific model input parameters and the corresponding\nreferences are listed in Tbl. 4.\nOur derived diameter and albedo values are shown in Tbl. 5.\nThe diameters are effective diameters of a sphere of equal volume. It can be considered as a \"scaling factor\" for shape models\nwhich lack the absolute size information. These values are the\nweighted mean values, based on the photometrically more reliable short wavelength detectors (46.4 to 85.0 \u03bcm). We also ex-\n\n5\n\ncluded the data which are flagged as being affected by high dark\ncurrents or high glitch rates. In the table we give the full standard deviation of all N radiometric solutions to account for the\nfact that different observations see the asteroid under different\nobserving and illumination geometries.\nTable 5.

Nevertheless, the\nresults agree very well with the so far published values.\nhe most accurate values for the diameter of (1) Ceres come\nfrom HST observations (Thomas et al. 2005) and adaptive optics (AO) observations using the Keck II telescope (Carry et al.\n2008). The HST observations led to an oblate spheroid with\naxes of a=b=487.3 km and c=454.7 km, resulting in an effective\ndiameter of 2 \u00d7 (a \u00d7 b \u00d7 c)1/3 =952.4 km. The AO data confirmed the oblate spheroid, but with slightly different values (a\n= b = 479.7\u00b12.3 km, c = 444.4\u00b12.1 km) and an effective diameter of 935.3 km. Our result is derived from very limited viewing\ngeometries, but it is in excellent agreement with the HST results. In this context it is interesting to note that the diameter\nderived from IRAS observations at 12, 25, 60 and 100 \u03bcm was\n848.40\u00b119.7 km (Tedesco et al. 2002b). Also our albedo value\nagrees very well with the 0.0936 derived via stellar occultation\ntechniques (Shevchenko & Tedesco 2006).\n(2) Pallas: Tedesco et al. (2002b) obtained from IRAS\ndata values of 498.07\u00b118.8 km and a geometric albedo of\n0.1587\u00b10.013. A combination of speckle, occultation and\nlightcurve observations of (2) Pallas lead to an ellipsoidal shape\nwith dimensions of 574 \u00b1 10 \u00d7 526 \u00b1 3 \u00d7 501 \u00b1 2 km and\na mean diameter of 533 \u00b1 6 km (Dunham et al. 1990). A recent high-angular resolution adaptive optics study by Carry et al.\n(2007) resulted in an absolute effective size of 519.5 km (semimajor ellipsoidal axes values of 276\u00d7256\u00d7248 km, \u00b110 km).\nDrummond & Christou (2008) found 494\u00b157 km based on another set of AO observations. The various results show that there\nare still significant uncertainties in the overall shape and size\nvalues, but the derived effective sizes agree within the given errorbars with our radiometric diameter. Therefore, we believe that\nour albedo of 0.142 is the most reliable value so far published for\nPallas.\n(4) Vesta has a very complex surface with large albedo variations on the surface (Binzel et al. 1997). Our diameter value\nis about 4% larger than the effective diameter from HST observations (axes 289, 280, and 229 \u00b1 5 km; De f f = 529.2 km;\nThomas et al. (1997), note added in proof) and about 7% larger\nthan the mean triaxial ellipsoid solution with 563 \u00b1 5 \u00d7 534 \u00b1\n5 \u00d7 442 \u00b1 7 km (2 * (a * b * c)1/3 = 510.3 \u00b1 5.6 km) given by\nDrummond & Christou (2008). This is outside the given rmsscatter from our 70 measurements which might be an indication\nthat the special emissivity model for Vesta (M\u00fcller & Lagerros\n1998) needs a small adjustment for this wavelength range.\nIt looks like the emissivity drop which has been seen by\nRedman et al. (1992, 1998) occurs already at shorter wave-\n\n\f6\n\nF. Hormuth and T. G. M\u00fcller: Catalogue of ISO LWS observations of asteroids\n\nTable 4. Object specific TPM input parameters.

This might also influence the outcome of the TPM\ntechnique which works best when combining data from different wavelengths, phase angles, rotational phases and aspect angles (M\u00fcller & Lagerros 2002). Shevchenko & Tedesco (2006)\nderived an albedo of pH =0.370 from occultation measurements,\nwhile we obtained a radiometric value of pV = 0.32\u00b10.02, again\nthis discrepancy might be explained by emissivity effects or the\nlimited aspect angle range. The albedo value in Tbl. 5 agrees\nvery well with previous studies by M\u00fcller & Lagerros (1998) (pV\n= 0.33) based on a set of thermal observations from mid-IR to\nmm-wavelengths.\nOur result for (10) Hygiea deviates significantly from\nprevious studies: Tedesco et al. (2002b) found values of\n407.12\u00b16.8 km and pV =0.0717\u00b10.002. M\u00fcller & Lagerros\n(1998) gave 429.9 km and 0.066. But Hygiea's shape model\nis not that well defined due to a poor lightcurve coverage\n(in rotational phases) and some very low quality lightcurves\n(Kaasalainen, priv. comm.). There might also be a second pole\nsolution at around \u03bbecl = 300\u25e6 (instead of the 117\u25e6 used here).\nBut neither using the second pole solutions nor using a spherical\nshape model lower the predicted size values (or the standard\ndeviations) significantly. One possibility for the discrepancies\nin the diameters could be emissivity issues. If Hygiea's far-IR\nemissivity is lower then the corresponding diameter would also\nbe smaller (and the albedo a bit larger). But the data quality\nand the very limited aspect angle range (all LWS observations\nwere taken within 20 days) are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions. Especially when looking at the best quality direct size\nmeasurement by Ragazzoni et al. (2000): They gave an effective\ndiameter of 444\u00b135 km (with an axis-ratio of a/b=1.11), based\non speckle techniques. Our radiometric results are still well\nwithin these error bars.\n5.3. Far-IR thermal lightcurve of (4) Vesta in the range\n45\u2212105 \u03bcm\n\nThe visual lightcurve of (4) Vesta is dominated by the influence of the albedo variations (Degewij et al. 1979). Standard\nlightcurve inversion techniques failed to produce a reliable\nshape model (Kaasalainen, priv. comm.), but high resolution\nHST imaging allowed a solution for the shape and spin vector\n(Thomas et al. 1997). Redman et al. (1992) found that the 1 mm\nlight-curve is apparently dominated by the triaxial shape, without any significant contributions from the optical albedo spots.\nM\u00fcller & Barnes (2007) showed that at even longer wavelengths\n(around 3.2 mm) the mm-lightcurve follows for a large fraction\nof the rotational period the shape-introduced variations. They\nalso demonstrated that the rotational phases with clear devia-\n\n5\n\nM. Kaasalainen, priv. comm.\n\ntions are connected to structures (e.g., the Olbers feature) which\nare visible in the HST images of (4) Vesta (Binzel et al. 1997).\nBefore we combined TPM lightcurve predictions with the\nobserved fluxes, we explored the influence of TPM input parameters on the thermal lightcurve amplitude and phase for the given\nwavelength range and aspect angles. It turned out that neither\nthe thermal inertia (the range between 0 and 50 J m\u22122 s\u22120.5 K\u22121\nwas considered) nor the beaming parameter, describing various\nroughness scenarios, influenced the predictions for our case significantly. The predicted lightcurve amplitudes varied between\n5\u22126% (peak-to-peak) and the lightcurve phases only by a few\nminutes between the low and high thermal inertia predictions.\nOur data sets were therefore not sufficient to confine any of these\nparameters.\nThe Vesta L02 observations from revolution 805 (28-Jan1998) were taken over a period of about 6 hours, covering\nslightly more than one full rotation period of 5.34 hours. On the\nbasis of the shape and spin-vector solution given in Tbl. 4 and\nthe diameter and albedo results from Tbl. 5 we predicted the\nthermal lightcurves at the L02 key-wavelengths for the LWS observations (note that the reference time frame is that of the ISO\nsatellite and not the asteroid-intrinsic one).\nFigure 3 shows the observations at 102.3 \u03bcm together with\nthe model prediction on an absolute flux and time scale. Figure 4\nshows the combined data below 105 \u03bcm, first normalised per detector over the full observing period and then averaged for a\ngiven rotational phase angle. The quality of the data from the\nlonger wavelength channels beyond 105 \u03bcm was not sufficient\nfor this kind of analysis.\nBoth figures show that the observations follow the model\npredictions. The errorbars in Fig. 4 correspond to the error of\nthe mean values plus a contribution from the flux uncertainty\nin these detectors. This figure combines in total 78 independent measurements (6 detectors \u00d7 13 measurements at different\nrotational phases). The model predictions match the observed\nlightcurve amplitude as well as the lightcurve phase (in the\nobserver's time frame). We also indicated the rotational phase\nwhere the Olbers-feature (Zellner et al. 1997; Binzel et al. 1997)\non Vesta's surface would be visible. We cannot see any influence of this surface feature with lower albedo. M\u00fcller & Barnes\n(2007) presented a more detailed discussion on how various thermal properties of this surface feature would influence the thermal\nlightcurve variations at different wavelengths. They found strong\nemissivity variations which they attributed to the Olbers structure and a neighbouring region. The deviation from the model\npredictions at rotational phases between 240\u2212280\u25e6 in Fig. 4 are\nalso close to the Olbers region and might therefore be the far-IR\nsignature of the ejecta material which is deposited on one side\nof the Olbers impact structure as discussed in M\u00fcller & Barnes\n(2007).\n\n\fF.

Conclusions\nVia radiometric techniques we derived the first far-IR-based diameter and albedo values for the four large asteroids Ceres,\nPallas, Vesta, and Hygiea. Based on photometry in the wavelength range 46\u201385\u03bcm we calculated effective diameters De f f\nof 960\u00b117 km, 534\u00b115 km, 549\u00b113 km, and 469\u00b127 km for\nthese four objects.
