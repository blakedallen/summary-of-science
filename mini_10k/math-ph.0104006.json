Introduction\nIt is a recurrent theme of recent years that the\nphysics of the not-so-distant future will probably\ninvolve some species of 'quantum space', a fuzzy\nsubstratum free of the singularities inherent in\nthe classical concept of a point. Then, if a long\ntradition continues, the algebraic codification of\nits properties will entail non-commutativity as an\nessential ingredient. The first textbooks on this\nnew physics will probably include an appendix\nwith elements of integration techniques on the\nrelevant non-commutative spaces. We know little\nyet about what these spaces might turn out to be\nbut there are general arguments that the coordinate functions over them generate Hopf algebras.\nWhile contemplating on the rest of the contents\nof the book, we attempt here a first sketch of\na part of its appendix-a short, informal crash\ncourse in some techniques in quantum integration.\n\u2217 Present address:\nInstituto de Ciencias Nucleares, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Mexico,\nApdo. Postal 70-543, 04510 M\u00e9xico, D.F., M\u00e9xico,\nchryss@nuclecu.unam.mx\n\nSec. 2 motivates the algebraic setting chosen. Hopf algebras are close enough to classical\ngroups to guarantee a continuity of language and\nyet accommodate naturally rather exotic geometrics. Assuming a convinced reader, Sec. 3 then\ngoes on with the basics of Hopf algebra integration, while Sec. 4 and 5 extend the discussion\nto the braided case. We rely on simple, detailed\nexamples to illustrate the proposed techniques.\n\n2. Quantum Points + Translations\n= Hopf Algebras\n2.1 Quantum points\nOnce we have decided to abandon classical manifolds we have to make up our mind on what kind\nof spaces we would like to consider. It is common place by now to emphasize that, having admitted non-commutativity in the algebra of functions over the 'space' under consideration, we can\nno longer talk about an underlying manifold consisting of points-what we are left with is the algebra of functions itself. What needs perhaps to\nbe also stressed, to dispel a certain feel of unease\n\n\fChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nCorfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle Physics, 1998\n\nthat comes with a pointless space, is that, as we\nwill see in the case of Hopf algebras, the 'manifold' still consists of well-defined entities, which\none could think of as 'quantum points'. To make\nthis more precise, consider a non-commutative,\nin general, algebra (A, m, 1A ), where A is a vector space and m a multiplication map, which will\nplay in the sequel the role of the algebra of functions over some 'quantum manifold'-we will denote its elements by a, b, etc.; 1A is the unit function. We concetrate on the conceptual aspects of\nthe problem and take A to be finite-dimensional,\navoiding potential divergences of the sums that\nenter in our discussion. Nevertheless, we find the\npicture of a continuous group manifold invaluable\nin developing some intuition and, although the\nlatter involves an infinite-dimensional algebra of\nfunctions, we will keep it in the back of our mind\nas a guide. Dual to A, in a sense to be made\nprecise shortly, is a 'quantum space' H, with elements g, h, x, y etc.-these are the 'quantum\npoints' referred to earlier and among them there\nis an identity 1H . Functions evaluated on points\ngive numbers, even in the quantum case. We formalize this by introducing an inner product, or\npairing, h*, *i between A and H, with values in C,\nvia hh, ai \u2261 a(h) \u2208 C for any function a \u2208 A and\n'point' h \u2208 H.\n\ncoproduct map\n\u2206 : H \u2192 H \u2297 H;\n\n(2.2)\n\nis symmetric under the exchange of its two tensor\nfactors. To put our notation in some use, we\nrewrite (2.1)\nhhcl , abi \u2261 hhcl , m(a \u2297 b)i\n= h\u2206(hcl ), a \u2297 bi\n= hhcl \u2297 hcl , a \u2297 bi\n= hhcl , ai hhcl , bi\n= a(hcl )b(hcl ) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nNotice how, in the second line above, the coproduct map \u2206 in H is dual to the product map\nm in A. We see that, in some sense, classical\npoints are quite primitive, in that the only information they carry is about their own position-\nwhen confronted with products of functions they\ncan only produce multiple copies of themselves.\nQuantum points can do better than this. When\npaired with products of functions they split, via\na coproduct map as above, in two other quantum\npoints, h 7\u2192 \u2206(h) \u2261 h(1) \u2297h(2) , with h(1) \u2297h(2) 6=\nh(2) \u2297 h(1) in general, and feed each of them in\nthe two factors of the product\n\nOne might ask at this stage, how can functions valued in C be non-commutative? The answer lies actually in the dual. To see this, consider a classical point hcl and evaluate on it the\nproduct of functions ab: (ab)(hcl ) = a(hcl )b(hcl )\nwhich is equal to (ba)(hcl ). What happens is that\nwhen a classical point sees a product of functions,\nit 'splits' in two copies of itself, hcl \u2192 hcl \u2297 hcl ,\nand feeds each of them as argument to each of\nthe factors in the product\n\nhh, abi = h(1) , a\n\nh(2) , b\n\n6= h(2) , a\n\nh(1) , b\n\n= hh, bai .\n\n(2.4)\n\nConsequently, ab 6= ba in general. By examining all the values of all the functions in A, one\ncan nevertheless establish commutation relations\nbetween them, e.g. if ba systematically returns\ntwice the value of ab, on all quantum points, one\nimposes the relation ba = 2ab in the algebra. The\nrule for assigning the two points h(1) \u2297 h(2) to h\n(i.e. the coproduct \u2206(h)) cannot of course be arbitrary. If the product in A is to be associative,\n\u2206 has to be coassosiative\n\n(ab)(hcl ) \u2261 (a \u2297 b)(hcl \u2297 hcl )\n= a(hcl )b(hcl ) .\n\nhcl 7\u2192 hcl \u2297 hcl\n\n(2.1)\n\n(\u2206 \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u2206 = (id \u2297\u2206) \u25e6 \u2206 .\n\nIf the underlying manifold consists in its entirety\nof such classical points, the functions ab and ba\nagree when evaluated on all points and can (and\nshould) therefore be considered equal. The conclusion is that the function algebra over a classical space is commutative because the classical\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe identity point is taken to be classical (or\ngrouplike): \u2206(1H ) = 1H \u2297 1H . We introduce\nalso a counit \u01eb in H. \u01eb(h) is defined to be the\nvalue of the unit function on h: \u01eb(h) \u2261 hh, 1A i.\nThis can be different from 1 since h can be an\n\n2\n\n\fCorfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle Physics, 1998\n\narbitrary linear combination of elements in H.\nJust like (A, m, 1A ) defines an algebra, the triple\n(H, \u2206, \u01eb) defines a coalgebra. Notice that we\ndon't have, at this point, any notion of product of quantum points-H is not yet an algebra\n(and, similarly, A is not yet a coalgebra).\nExperimenting a little with the above, one\ndiscovers that \u2206(h) has, in general, to involve\na sum over pairs of points, rather than a single\npair. We continue to denote such a sum by h(1) \u2297\nh(2) i.e.\nX\n(2.6)\nhi(1) \u2297 hi(2) \u2261 h(1) \u2297 h(2) .\n\u2206(h) =\n\nChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nother words we can endow H with an associative\nproduct (turning it into an algebra) and define\nah (g) \u2261 a(hg). From this we can abstract the notion of an 'indefinitely translated' function a(*) (*),\nwhere the argument in the subscript defines the\ntranslation and the second argument evaluates\nthe translated function. Such a function can be\nwritten as a sum over tensor products of singleargument functions\nX\nai(1) (*) \u2297 ai(2) (*)\na(*) (*) \u2261\ni\n\n\u2261 a(1) \u2297 a(2) ,\n\n(2.10)\n\ni\n\nwhich we realize as a coproduct in A. Coassociativity of this coproduct is dual to the associativity of the product in H, which itself guarrantees\nthe general property (2.9) of an action. \u2206 can\nequally well be thought of as describing translations from the right, in this case the element of H\nthat describes the translation is fed in the second\ntensor factor and the resulting right-translated\nfunction accepts arguments in the first. We can\nalso introduce a counit \u01eb in A: \u01eb(a) is the value\nof a at the identity. Since the identity point is\nclassical, \u01eb supplies a one-dimensional representation for A: \u01eb(ab) = \u01eb(a)\u01eb(b). Notice that, again,\nproduct and coproduct are dual\n\nThe coassociativity mentioned above says that\nh(1)(1) \u2297 h(1)(2) \u2297 h(2) = h(1) \u2297 h(2)(1) \u2297 h(2)(2)\n\u2261 h(1) \u2297 h(2) \u2297 h(3) ,\n(2.7)\nwhere in the last line we have renumbered sequentially the subscripts, given that the particular order of applying the successive \u2206's does\nnot matter. There are two points that should be\nkept in mind to avoid confusion with the above\nnotation: first, h(1) \u2297 h(2) in (2.6) and in the second line of (2.7) denotes two different things and\nsecond, there are n \u2212 1 implied summations in\nh(1) \u2297 . . . \u2297 h(n) .\n\nhhg, ai = h \u2297 g, a(1) \u2297 a(2) .\n\n2.2 Translations\n\nIt is rather natural to impose on translations a\ncertain covariance property: they should respect\nthe 'quantum nature' of A i.e. the 'indefinitely'\ntranslated functions should obey the same commutation relations as the original ones. This implies that the coproduct should be an algebra\nhomomorphism\n\nWe continue building up an arena for physics\nby introducing a concept of translations for our\nfunctions-it is in terms of this that the invariance of our integral will be expressed (there are\nof course other uses for it as well). Quite generally, one can describe (left) translated functions\nby introducing a new algebra T that acts on the\npoints in H via a left action\n\u22b2:\n\n\u2206(ab) = \u2206(a)\u2206(b)\n(ab)(1) \u2297 (ab)(2) = a(1) b(1) \u2297 a(2) b(2) .\n\nT \u2297H \u2192 H,\nt \u2297 h 7\u2192 t \u22b2 h ,\n\n(2.12)\n\n(2.8)\n\nBy looking at hhg, abi one finds that the same\nshould hold in H-this turns A and H into bialgebras. What is missing in order to turn both\nof them into full-fledged Hopf algebras is the antipode S. This can be useful if, after translating\nour functions by some h, we change our mind\nand wish to undo the translation. When H is a\n\nwith\n(tu) \u22b2 h = t \u22b2 (u \u22b2 h) ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n(2.9)\n\nt, u \u2208 T and h \u2208 H. Then the translated function a \u2208 A by t, which we write as at , is defined via at (h) \u2261 a(t \u22b2 h). The simplest choice\nfor T is H itself with \u22b2 a left multiplication, in\n\n3\n\n\fChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nCorfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle Physics, 1998\n\nclassical group (discrete or not), S(h) = h\u22121 and\nA inherits an antipode via S(a)(h) \u2261 a(S(h)).\nIn the general case we define S via\nS(h(1) )h(2) = \u01eb(h) = h(1) S(h(2) )\n\nA is generated by the functions {f i }, i =\n0, . . . , n \u2212 1, with ei , f j = \u03b4i j , and is commutative. f i is is a delta-like function peaked\nover ei , hence f i f j = 0 whenever i 6= j while\neach f i squares to itself. Since no new functions\ncan be produced by multiplication, A is linearly\nspanned by the set {f i }. The coproduct in A is\ngiven by the same numerical constants that give\nthe product in H: \u2206(f i ) = Mjk i f j f k . Notice\nthat (ei \u2297 f i )(ej \u2297 f j ) = ei \u2297 ei \u2297 f i , which in\nturn is equal to \u2206(ei ) \u2297 f i . ei \u2297 f i is the canonical element and the above identity is in the spirit\nof ea+b = ea eb .\n\n(2.13)\n\n(similarly for A) and it still holds\nhS(h), ai = hh, S(a)i .\n\n(2.14)\n\nS is an antihomomorphism, S(hg) = S(g)S(h).\nNotice that S 2 is not necessarily the identity map;\nthis can be a nuissance in transcribing classical\nresults that hold for groups in the general Hopf\nalgebra case but it is also the source of unexpected novelties. We will often pick a linear basis {f i }, i = 0, . . . , N in A. This means that any\nfunction in A can be written as a linear combination, with coefficients in C, of the f i -we\nchoose f 0 = 1A , the unit function. Similarly,\n{ei }, i = 0, . . . , N , will be a dual linear basis in\nH with ei , f j = \u03b4i j ; e0 will denote the identity\n1H .\nTo summarize, we started from a primitive\nnotion of 'quantum space' and the functions defined over it and saw that, in general, the former\nforms a coalgebra while the latter an algebra.\nFurther introducing translations and requiring\ntheir compatibility with the algebra of functions\nresults in a symmetric structure, turning both\nthe space and the functions over it into bialgebras. Adding a notion of inverse we end up with\na pair of dual Hopf algebras. We illustrate the\nabove concepts in the following two examples.\n\nThe unit function is 1 on every ei so that\n\u01eb(ei ) = 1. All f i , except f 0 , vanish on the identity hence \u01eb(f 0 ) = 1, \u01eb(f i ) = 0, i 6= 0. For\nthe antipode we have S(ei ) = ei \u22121 \u2261 Si j ej and\n\u2737\nS(f i ) = Sj i f j .\n\nExample 2.2 A discrete 'quantum space'\n\nH is generated by 1, x and y with x2 = 0, y 2 = y\nand yx = \u2212xy + x.

The\nrest of the Hopf structure is \u01eb(x) = \u01eb(y) = 0\nand S(x) = \u2212(1 \u2212 2y)x, S(y) = y (notice that\nS 2 (x) = \u2212x). H is spanned linearly by {ei } =\nk\n{1, x, y, xy}. Writing ei ej = (Mi )j ek and \u2206(ei ) =\nj\n(W k )i ej ek we find\n\nExample 2.1 Discrete classical space\nH in this case is a discrete group algebra. It\ncontains n classical points {ei }, i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1\nand their linear combinations. The coproduct is\n\u2206(ei ) = ei \u2297 ei (no summation over i).

Consequently, we can use it to evaluate the integral of\na group element or a difference operator.

Our\napproach will be based on a 'vacuum expectation\nvalue' treatment of the integral [15].

For x a group-like\nelement, x \u22b2 a is the function a (right) translated\nby x. When x is a difference-like operator, x \u22b2 a\nis the 'derivative' of a along x.

The r.h.s.\nabove is an element of A \u22ca H that realizes the\noperator |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A |. The latter is unique up to\nscale, and hence, for different inputs a in the\nl.h.s., we get numerical multiples of the same operator in the r.h.s. (after using the commutation\nrelations in A \u22ca H to bring the r.h.s. in some\nstandard ordering). After choosing a normalization for |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A |, we may define haiR\nv to be the\nnumerical constant that multiplies |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A | in\nthe l.h.s. above. Notice that when the left and\nright integrals coincide, \u0112aE is a pure function\nand |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A | is realized in A.

Then (3.3) returns the integral of a multiplied by the integral\nof the unit element in the dual and will hence fail\nwhenever the latter vanishes. Our modified trace\nabove avoids this by summing over all integrals\nin the dual and 'tagging' each by the (linearly\nindependent) f n . The appearance of |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A |\nin (3.12) might look a little strange now, but it\nis actually a blessing in disguise. When later we\nlook for an integral in braided Hopf algebras, it\nwill become apparent that a purely numerical integral cannot, in general, transform covariantly\nand the operator |\u03a9A ih\u03a9A | that the braided analog of the above construction produces exactly\ncompensates for the fact that we do not explicitly display the measure used in our integrations.\n\nChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nintegral in A is given by h*iLv = hS(*)iR\nv .

The usual bosonic\nand fermionic rules for transposition can be put\nin this language but, in general, \u03a8 can be much\nmore drastic, as the action of R that precedes\nthat of \u03c4 if often far from trivial.\n\nrespectively (the output braid of the counit is\nsupressed since, being a number, it braids trivially). Covariance is codified in the requirement\nthat one should be able to move crossings past\nall vertices and boxes, e.g. the relations\n\nshould hold. The inner product and the canonical element look like\n\n4.2 Braided Hopf algebras\nOne might think now of developing an algebra,\ninvolving products, coproducts etc., in which all\ntypographical transpositions are effected by \u03a8,\n\u03a8\u22121 , rather than \u03c4 . Braided Hopf algebras are\na transcription of ordinary Hopf algebras in this\nbraided setting [10]. Thus, one has a braided\nantipode, braided coproduct etc., which satisfy\n\nx\n\na\n\nf\n\ni\n\nei\n\nFor the product-coproduct duality we adopt a\nconvention which is slightly different from the\n\n8\n\n\fChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nCorfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle Physics, 1998\n\n(\u03a82 = id) in this case). \u01eb(\u03be) = 0 and S(\u03be) = \u2212\u03be.\nRepresenting the integral with a rhombus, we\nwant it to satisfy\n\none we used before, as shown below\nx a b\n\nx\n\na b\n\nx y a\n\nx y\n\na\n\na\n\nx a\n\nx\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\n(5.1)\n\nAs a result, to get the unbraided expression that\ncorresponds to any of the diagrammatic identities that appear in the following, one should\ntranslate the diagrams, ignoring the braiding information, into the language of Sect. 3 and then\nset \u2206 \u2192 \u2206\u2032 , S \u2192 S \u22121 .

Our starting point is the braided analogue of the vacuum projectors of (3.11). Denoting them by E, \u0112 we find\n\n5. Braided Integrals\n5.1 Problems with braiding\nIn the case of braided Hopf algebras, the integral\npresents an additional complication. Defining it,\nalong the lines of (3.1), as a number, implies that\nit braids trivially, regardless of the transformation properties of the integrand. This can easily\nbe seen to lead to problems when combined with\nthe translational invariance property, as the following toy example shows.\n\nE =\n\n\u0112 =\n\n(5.2)\n\nWe give, in Fig. 1, the proof that Ea = E\u01eb(a), for\nall a in A-the rest of the required relations are\nproved similarly.\nForming \u0112aE and treating\nE as a spectator, we get a glimpse of the inner\nworkings of the rhombus\n\nExample 5.1 The fermionic line\nConsider the algebra A of functions on the classical fermionic line. It is generated by 1 and a\nfermionic variable \u03be, with \u03be 2 = 0, and admits the\nbraided coproduct \u2206(\u03be) = \u03be\u22971+1\u2297\u03be, with \u03a8 the\nstandard fermionic braiding, \u03a8(\u03be \u2297 \u03be) = \u2212\u03be \u2297 \u03be\n\n(5.3)\n\n9\n\n\fChryssomalis Chryssomalakos1\n\nCorfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle Physics, 1998\n\nFigure 1: Proof of E a = E \u01eb(a), a \u2208 A\n\n1\u2212\u03be\u03c3 and the standard Hopf structure and braiding. Then, {ei } = {1, \u03c3} and {f i } = {1, \u03be} which\ngives E = 1 \u2212 \u03be\u03c3 = \u03c3\u03be and E \u0304 = 1 \u2212 \u03c3\u03be = \u03be\u03c3. For\nthe integrals we compute \u0112E = 0 and \u0112\u03beE = \u03be.\nLeft and right integrals coincide in this case so\n|\u03a9A ih\u03a9A | is realized in A by \u03be and we recover\nthe Berezin result. Notice that (5.3) gives the\nBerezin integral as a sum over 'points'. The integral of the unit function receives two equal (unit)\ncontributions from the two 'points' in the space,\nbut the undercrossing in \u0112 flips the sign of one\nof them so that they cancel.\n\u2737\n\nThe output in the above diagram is a multiple\nof the delta function, the coefficient being the\nnumerical integral of the input. Again, one can\nshow that this provides a non-trivial integral for\nall finite dimensional braided Hpf algebras, transcribing either (3.14) or the more elegant proof\nin [13]. Opting for the latter we find\n\n1\n\nExample 5.3 The quantum fermionic plane\n\n(5.4)\nfrom which non-triviality follows.
