By adopting\na semi-analytical technique, we study the non-linear interplay among particle\nacceleration, magnetic field generation and shock dynamics, outlining a selfconsistent scenario for the origin of the spectrum of Galactic cosmic rays as\nproduced in this class of sources. Moreover, the inferred chemical abundances\nsuggest nuclei heavier than Hydrogen to be relevant not only in the shock dynamics but also in the calculation of the \u03b3-ray emission from SNRs due to the\ndecay of neutral pions produced in nuclear interactions.\nKeywords: cosmic rays, acceleration of particles, SNR, \u03b3-rays\n\n1. Cosmic rays and supernova remnants\nFor more than 70 years scientists have been regarding supernova remnants\n(SNRs) as the most plausible sources for Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), but\nonly in recent times the theoretical comprehension of the ongoing processes\nhave made important steps forward (see also P. Blasi's contribution in this\nvolume). Once a model for CR propagation in the Milky Way is assumed, it\nis possible to infer from observations at Earth the spectra of single chemical\nspecies expected at the sources. In this work we investigate a scenario in\nwhich Galactic SNRs are responsible for the acceleration of protons and\nheavier nuclei (hereafter HN), trying to disentangle the solid, physical ingredients and the phenomenological recipes which have to be included in\norder to account for many observational constraints. In particular we show\nthat, according to this SNR paradigm for the origin of GCRs, HN may\nplay a fundamental role in the shock dynamics and also contribute in a\nnon-negligible way to the \u03b3-ray emission from SNRs.\nWe consider here a semi-analytical approach to the problem of non-\n\n\fFebruary 27, 2018\n\n13:13\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nComo10\n\n2\n\nlinear diffusive acceleration of particles at shocks (NLDSA) following the\nbasic implementation put forward in Ref. 1\u20133, also including the effects\nof the magnetic field amplification on the shock dynamics4 and the pressure of the most abundant CR species.5 The evolution of a remnant in a\nhomogeneous circumstellar medium is followed in a quasi-stationary way\nas in Ref. 6 and coupled with the acceleration of particles at the forward\nshock as in Refs. 5,7. For the details of the computational apparatus, the\nreader may refer to the papers above. Here, we only would like to highlight\nhow such a semi-analytical approach to NLDSA is typically much faster\nthan, and as much rigorous as, other fully numerical or Monte Carlo methods for non-relativistic shocks,8 and therefore it is very useful for including\nmulti-specie CRs or, in general, for studying problems with a wide range\nof environmental parameters.\nIn our calculations protons are injected into the acceleration process\nfrom the thermal bath through a \"thermal-leakage\" mechanism,9 which\nis sensitive to the shock dynamics and tends to suppress the number of\ninjected particles when the the acceleration becomes more and more efficient. The amounts of injected HN are tuned by hand relatively to protons to reproduce the abundances measured at Earth. This recipe, while\nincluding a reasonable feedback which self-regulates the efficiency of the\ninjection, has to be regarded as a necessary phenomenological description\nsince, unfortunately, the HN injection at SNR shocks is still poorly understood for two main reasons. First, injection strongly depends on the\ncharge/mass ratio and it is very difficult to follow the degree of ionization\nof heavy atoms during their acceleration; second, refractory elements (Mg,\nSi, Fe,...) are thought to be injected as a result of sputtering of accelerating dust grains.10,11 The latter phenomenon, though very hard to deal\nwith quantitatively, is however expected to produce largely suprathermal\n(but still non-relativistic) ions able to cross the shock from downstream to\nupstream because of their large gyroradii. For the same reason, partially\nionized heavy atoms are expected to be preferentially injected, in agreement with the relative abundances measured in GCRs.10,11 Nevertheless,\nsince our abundances are tuned on the relativistic region of the GCR spectrum, we can bypass the problem above and make safe predictions about\nthe role of HN in the shock dynamics and in the SNR \u03b3-ray emission.\nAt any given time the shock dynamics is regulated by the non-linear interplay between particle acceleration, occurring via first-order Fermi mechanism, and magnetic field amplification, which we model as due to resonant\nstreaming instability excited by all the accelerated particles.12 On one hand,\n\n\fFebruary 27, 2018\n\n13:13\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nComo10\n\n3\n\nthe pressure in CRs diffusing around the shock leads to the formation of a\nprecursor which slows down the incoming fluid and tends to make the shock\nweaker while, on the other hand, the pressure in the shape of self-generated\nmagnetic turbulence may become comparable to, or even larger than, the\ngas pressure upstream, preventing an excessive modification of the velocity\nprofile. This magnetic feedback 13 has proved itself to be a very common\nmechanism able to account, at the same time, for both the level of magnetization and the hydrodynamics inferred by multi-wavelength studies of\nyoung SNRs.4 In addition, when the velocity of the scattering centres, which\nwe assume to be transverse Alfv\u00e9n waves as predicted by the quasi-linear\ntheory of resonant streaming instability, becomes a non-negligible fraction\nof the fluid velocity, the compression ratios actually felt by the fluid and\nby the accelerated particles are no longer the same. A physically motivated\naccount for the relative velocity between the fluid and the waves leads to\nconclude that the more efficient the magnetic field amplification (the larger\nthe Alfv\u00e9n velocity) is, the steeper the spectra of the accelerated particles\nare (see e.g. \u00a77 of Ref. 5).\n2. Particle escape from SNRs\nIn order to explain the observations at Earth, one has to account for when\nand how accelerated particles leave the source and become CRs. There\nare three main mechanisms playing a potential role in the problem: escape\nfrom upstream, escape from downstream and release at the \"death\" of the\nremnant (after having undergone adiabatic losses). In general, the total CR\nflux provided by a single source is given by the convolution over its life of\nthese three contributions. Let us discuss them in some more detail.\nDuring the ejecta-dominated stage the shock velocity Vsh is roughly\nconstant: the magnetic field is expected to increase, in turn leading to more\nand more energetic particles. In such a situation no particle can diffuse away\nfrom upstream. During the Sedov-Taylor stage, instead, both the shock velocity and the magnetization level decrease: the diffusion length increases\nas 1/Vsh \u221d t3/5 and hence the highest-energy particles are no longer able\nto make it back to the shock, since it moves as Rsh \u221d t2/5 .14 Quantitatively\nspeaking, we assume that at any moment the system can confine only particles with diffusion length D(E, \u03b4B)/Vsh \u2264 \u03c7Rsh , where D(E, \u03b4B) is the\nBohm diffusion coefficient in the amplified field \u03b4B, by imposing the distribution function of the accelerated particles to vanish for radii larger than\n(1 + \u03c7)Rsh (see also Ref. 3).\nClearly, most of accelerated particles are advected behind the shock\n\n\fFebruary 27, 2018\n\n13:13\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nComo10\n\n4\n\nand, trapped in the expanding shell, cannot do but losing energy adiabatically. If, for any reason (like, for instance, the presence of strong density or\nmagnetic patterns in the circumstellar medium), the SNR shell were \"broken\", preferential conduits might channel particles from downstream into\nthe Galaxy. Such a contribution is in principle very hard to model, thus we\nassume that, at any given time, a 10% of the downstream accelerated particles is injected into the Galaxy, contributing to the diffuse GCRs.7 Finally,\nthe remainder of the advected particles should be released at the \"death\"\nof the SNRs, which is also quite difficult to define: it might coincide with\nthe beginning of the radiative stage, but actually it should be more closely\nrelated to the damping of the magnetic field and hence to the transition\nfrom a SNR-like to a Galactic-like regime for the particle diffusion.\nWe consider here a \"benchmark\" SN explosion releasing 1.4 solar masses\nwith total kinetic energy 1051 erg in the homogeneous circumstellar environment, taken with temperature 106 K and particle density \u03c10 = 0.01mH cm\u22123 .\nThe remnant evolution is thus followed as in Ref. 6, Tab. 7, and the SNR\nis imposed to die at the end of the Sedov stage. The transport in the\nGalaxy is then calculated within a simple leaky-box model, assuming a\nhalo height of 3.5 kpc, a Galaxy radius of 10 kpc and a residence time\n\u03c4esc (R) = 20(R/10GV)\u22120.55 Myr, where R is the nucleus rigidity. When\nspallation (mainly relevant at low energies and for HN) is also included,15\nthe spectra of the GCRs is recovered in terms of slope, normalization and\ncut-off (see Figs. 3,4 in Ref. 5).\nIt is however worth keeping in mind that the recipe linking magnetic\nfield amplification and the velocity of the scattering centers is rather phenomenological and it has not been thoroughly calculated from first principles, yet. Remarkably, at the moment it represents the only proposed effect\nable to produce source spectra steeper than E \u22122 (see also Ref. 16) and\ntherefore consistent with the inferred value of \u03b4 = 0.3 \u2212 0.6 for the scaling\nof the Galactic residence time \u03c4esc \u221d E \u2212\u03b4 . In fact, in Ref. 17 such an effect\nis not included and \u03b4 = 0.75 is required to recover the GCR spectrum.\n3. The role of heavy nuclei\nThe chemical abundances fitting the GCR data at Earth are selfconsistently put in the computational apparatus in a recursive way until consistency is reached, since the non-linear nature of the acceleration\nprocess does not allow an a priori exact determination of the proton/HN\nratios. Provided that the relative abundances do not depend on time, such\na process allow us to investigate the role of HN at any given time of the\n\n\fFebruary 27, 2018\n\n13:13\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nComo10\n\n5\n\nSNR evolution.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 1 a snapshot of the shock profile at the age\nt = 2000 yr (beginning of the Sedov phase) is shown, in units of x0 =\n\u03c7Rsh \u2243 0.2Rsh , i.e. the distance of the free-escape boundary from the\nshock. U (x) is the local velocity in units of Vsh , Pg (Pw ) is the gas (magnetic\nfield) pressure and the other curves correspond to the contributions to the\npressure by accelerated particles of different species, as in the legend; all\n2\npressures are normalized to \u03c10 Vsh\n.\n\nFig. 1. Left panel: spatial profile of the modified shock. See text for the details of\nthe different curves. Right panel: \u03b3-ray spectrum from \u03c0 0 decay produced in nuclear\ncollisions, in arbitrary units. Both panels correspond to a SNR age of about 2000 yr.\n\nIt is easy to see that more than 10% of the bulk pressure is channelled\ninto accelerated particles, and that HN contribute as much as the protons to\nthe shock dynamics. Most of their contribution comes from He nuclei, but\nheavier elements still account for about 25% of PALL . As outlined above, the\npressure in magnetic turbulence Pw turns out to be larger than the gas pressure Pg < 10\u22124 , and thus the precursor is dynamically dominated by the\ninterplay between CRs and magnetic field.4,13 Moreover, since Pw \u221d PALL ,\nwe can postulate that HN play a non-negligible role also in the amplification\nof the background magnetic field via streaming instability.\nAnother interesting consequence of the acceleration of HN is that they\nmay make an impact on the hadronic \u03b3-ray emission from SNRs, i.e. the\nemission due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nuclear collisions\nbetween relativistic particles and background gas.18 For distributions of\naccelerated particles \u221d E \u22122 , the contribution to the \u03b3-ray flux by different\nchemicals is simply proportional to their relative abundances (see also \u00a75 in\nRef. 5). This means that, for the chemical composition determined above,\nHN contribute in a substantial way to the \u03b3-ray flux from a SNR (more\n\n\fFebruary 27, 2018\n\n13:13\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nComo10\n\n6\n\nthan a factor 2 for the case depicted in Fig. 1). The maximum \u03b3-ray energy\nproduced by all the HN is typically half the one produced by protons, since\nthe acceleration is rigidity-dependent while the energy of the secondaries\nscales with the energy per nucleon. This effect leads to an alteration in the\nshape of the cut-off, a signature probably too hard to be discriminated by\nobservations (ALL vs H curve in the right panel of Fig. 1).\nVery generally, the inclusion of HN implies that the observed \u03b3-ray flux\nfrom a given SNR may be achieved with, say, half the density of the target\ngas with respect to a case accounting for accelerated protons only. As a\nconsequence, the HN contribution is of great importance when the density\nof the circumstellar medium is deduced by the level of \u03b3-rays of hadronic\norigin. A different estimate of the circumstellar density, in principle, leads\nalso to a different modelling of the SNR evolution, affecting the inferred age,\nradius, expansion rate and, eventually, distance of the object. Even more\ninterestingly, a reduced circumstellar density would also imply a strong\nsuppression (\u221d \u03c12 ) of the expected thermal emission of the shocked plasma,\nboth in terms of continuum and lines. Possible HN overabundances, with\nrespect to the \"standard\" values above, might as well account for the lack of\ndetection of thermal emission in single \u03b3-ray-bright SNRs as, for instance,\nRX J1713.7-3946.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n\nE.
