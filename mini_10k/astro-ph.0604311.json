Being\nfirst suggested as explanation [1, 2] for the observation\nof cosmic rays with energy above the so-called GreisenZatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, it has been later developed into the study of a new form of dark matter.\nThe concept of dark matter composed by superheavy\n> 1013 GeV (further on we shall call\nparticles with mX \u223c\nthem X particles) at first glance seems to be exotic,\nmainly because of two questions: How can SHDM particles have a lifetime exceeding the age of the universe,\nand why their abundance should be dominant in the universe today? The answers to both questions have been\nknown for a long time and are based on quite general\ntheoretical concepts. The problem of the stability or the\nquasi-stability of a heavy particle exists also for the lightest supersymmetric particle, e.g. the neutralino. Discrete\ngauge symmetries protecting neutralinos from fast decays\nwork equally well for other particles. A particular example of a particle with lifetime exceeding the age of the\nuniverse was given in Ref. [3]. The large abundance of superheavy relic particles can be provided by gravitational\nproduction [4], which works for superheavy particles very\nsimilar to the production of density fluctuations during\ninflation.\nIn contrast to usual thermal relics, like e.g. neutralinos, SHDM particles are non-thermal relics and have\nbeen never in chemical equilibrium with radiation. They\nmust be produced very early, at the end of inflation.\nThen it is enough to transfer a tiny fraction from the\nenergy of radiation to SHDM particles, less than 10\u221218 ,\nin order to have \u03a9X \u223c 0.3 now: The energy density of\n\nnon-relativistic X particles diminishes with time as 1/a3 ,\nwhere a(t) is the scaling factor of the universe, while the\nenergy density of radiation diminishes as 1/a4 . When\nnormalized at the inflationary epoch, ai = 1, a(t) has\nthe enormous value \u223c 1 \u00d7 1022 now. Not surprisingly,\nthis small energy fraction can be transferred to X particles by many different mechanisms, such as thermal production at reheating [1, 5], the non-perturbative regime\nof a broad parametric resonance at preheating [6], and\nproduction by topological defects [1, 7].\n>\nThermal production of X particles with mX \u223c\n13\n10 GeV requires a very high reheating temperature Trh .\nIn supersymmetric cosmology, Trh is limited by gravitino\n< (109 \u2212 1010 ) GeV. However, the\noverproduction as Trh \u223c\ngravitino density can be diluted efficiently by entropy\nproduction during thermal inflation [8]. Thermal inflation solves the problem of overproduction of particle at\nreheating and allows higher temperatures with efficient\nSHDM production. In Ref. [7], it was shown that the\nmaximal temperature after inflation can be much higher\nthan Trh .\nX particles are efficiently produced at preheating [6].\nThis stage, predecessor of reheating, is caused by oscillations of the inflaton field after inflation near the minimum of its potential. Such an oscillating field can nonperturbatively (in the regime of a broad parametric resonance) produce intermediate bosons \u03c7, which then decay\ninto X particles. The mass of the X particles can be one\nor two orders of magnitude larger than the inflaton mass\nm\u03c6 , which should be about 1013 GeV.\nX particles can be also produced by topological defects, such as strings or textures. Particle production occurs at string intersections or in collapsing texture knots.\nX particles can also be produced by hybrid topological\n\n\f2\ndefects, such as monopoles connected by strings or walls\nbound by strings. The main contribution to the X particle density is given by the earliest epochs, soon after\ntopological defect formation. Topological defects of the\nenergy scale \u03b7 > mX can be formed in phase transitions\nat or slightly before the end of inflation. Efficient production of topological defects is predicted for the preheating\nstage.\nHowever, the most remarkable creation mechanism for\nSHDM is its gravitational production [9]. Particles are\ncreated by time-variable gravitational fields during the\nexpansion of the universe. For this mechanism the interaction of X particles with other particles (e.g. with\nthe inflaton) is not required, even sterile particles are\nproduced. The present abundance \u03a9shdm of the X particles is mainly determined by its mass mX , while the\ndependence of \u03a9shdm on the reheating temperature Trh\nis model-dependent. To provide \u03a9shdm = 0.27, needed\naccording to WMAP observations [10], the mass of the\nX particle must be (a few) \u00d71013 GeV.\nThe stability of X particles can be ensured by discrete\ngauge symmetries. It must be weakly broken, if we want\n> t0 , where t0 is the\nlong-lived particles with lifetime \u03c4X \u223c\nage of the universe. This superweak symmetry breaking\ncan occur due to wormhole [1] or instanton effects [2].\nAlternatively, discrete gauge symmetries could be broken\nby higher-dimensional operators [11]. An example of a\nSHDM particle in a semi-realistic particle physics model\nare cryptons, i.e. bound-states from a strongly interacting\nhidden sector of string/M theory [3, 12, 13].\nWhat are the prospects to observe SHDM, if X particles are absolutely stable?\nThis is a pessimistic case for SHDM, because unitarity\nlimits severely the XX-annihilation cross section: Since\nthe velocity of X particles is very small, v \u226a 1, only the\ns-wave contributes to h\u03c3ann vi = a+bv 2 +O(v 4 ), resulting\n<\nin an unobservable small cross section, h\u03c3ann vi \u2248 a \u223c\n1/m2X . An interesting and rather exceptional case was\nfound in Ref. [14], when X particles are cosmologically\nproduced in the form of close pairs and form bound states\ndue to gauge interactions between them. The lifetime\nof pairs corresponds to the spiral-in time of pairs with\ntheir subsequent annihilation, as in the case of monopoleantimonopole pairs.\nIn the framework of gravitational production of\nSHDM, the mass of the X particle is fixed as (a\nfew) \u00d71013 GeV, and we are left in the SHDM model\nwith only one free parameter, the lifetime of the X particles \u03c4X . If one requires that the \"AGASA excess\" is\nexplained by the SHDM model (see below), then this parameter is fixed by the UHECR flux observed by this\nexperiment.\nAt present, the most interesting manifestation of\nSHDM may be the observations of UHECR beyond the\nGZK cutoff [1, 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. There are three\nbasic signatures of UHECRs from SHDM:\n\u2022 SHDM particles as any other DM particles cluster\n\ngravitationally and accumulate in the halo of our\ngalaxy with an overdensity 2.1 \u00d7 105 . Hence the\nUHECR flux from SHDM has no GZK cutoff in\nenergy spectrum [1].\n\u2022 Since in the decays or annihilations of X particles\npions are more abundant than nucleons, UHE neutrinos and photons are the dominant component of\nthe primary flux [1].\n\u2022 The non-central position of the Sun in the galactic\nhalo results in an anisotropic UHECR flux from\nSHDM [16].\nThe quantitative predictions for the energy spectra and\nthe photon/nucleon (\u03b3/N ) ratio in the decays or annihilations of X particles required the extension of existing\nQCD calculations for parton cascades from the TeV scale\nup-to the scale mX . The first calculations used the analytic limiting spectrum approximation [20] or extended\nthe Monte Carlo simulation HERWIG [15]. More recent\ncalculations using a SUSY-QCD Monte Carlo [21, 22]\nand the DGLAP evolution equations[22, 23, 24] predict quite accurately the secondary spectra from decays/annihilation of SHDM particles and agree well with\neach other. Their most important outcome for UHECR\nobservations is the flat shape of the energy spectrum. At\nthe relevant energies, it can be approximated as dE/E 1.9\nwhile the photon/nucleon ratio is \u03b3/N = r\u03b3/N (x) \u2248 2 \u2212 3\n[22], being only weakly dependent on x = 2E/mX .\nAn anisotropic UHECR flux from SHDM is guaranteed\nby the fact that the distance from the Sun to the outer\nboundary of the DM halo is largest in the direction of\nthe galactic center (GC). Numerical simulations of the\nDM distribution show an increase of the DM density towards the GC as \u221d r\u22121 [25] or \u221d r\u22121.5 [26]. This further\nenhances the expected anisotropy. The relevant calculations for this anisotropy were presented in Ref. [17].\nComparisons of the calculated anisotropy [18, 19] with\nexisting data of the air-shower arrays on the northern\nhemisphere have revealed no contradiction between data\nand model predictions. By contrast, detectors on the\nsouthern hemisphere able to observe the GC are much\nmore sensitive to this anisotropy. The data of the old\nSUGAR detector located in Australia are only marginally\nconsistent with the prediction of the SHDM model [27].\nAt what energy UHECRs from SHDM become the\ndominant component?\nThe answer to this question became unambiguous after\nthe precise calculation of the spectrum of secondary particles produced in the SUSY-QCD cascade, which can\nbe approximated as \u221d E \u22121.9 . This spectrum is very\nflat and fitting it to the AGASA data [28] shows that\nit can become the dominant component of the UHECR\nflux only at energies above 8 \u00d7 1019 eV (see Fig. 1). This\nis an important and reliable conclusion about the status\nof UHECR from SHDM.\nThe photon dominance is another reliable prediction of\nthe SHDM model.

The sum of these two spectra is shown by full curves\nfor two SHDM fluxes with different normalizations. The \u03c72\nvalues are given for the comparison of these curves with the\nexperimental data at E \u2265 4 \u00d7 1019 eV.

Proton and photon induced showers can be distinguished by the muon component observed at ground level. An analysis of events\nwith energies E \u2265 1 \u00d7 1020 eV has been performed for\nthe AGASA data [30, 31] and very recently in Ref. [32]\nfor the combined AGASA [28] and Yakutsk data [33]. We\nshall discuss this analysis in Section 2. Here we only note\nthat no photon induced showers have been found among\nsix AGASA and four Yakutsk events with energies higher\nthan 1 \u00d7 1020 eV. One may conclude therefore that the\nSHDM model is not confirmed by this analysis.\nWe summarize our introduction emphasizing that at\n> 1 \u00d7 1020 eV\npresent only the \"AGASA excess\" at E \u223c\nmotivates the SHDM model as explanation for the existing UHECR data. The data of other detectors, e.g.\nYakutsk or HiRes, are compatible with the GZK cutoff.\nIn this case, the UHECR flux from SHDM can be only\nsubdominant and is reduced compared to the fit to the\nAGASA data shown in Fig. 1. If the Auger experiment\nconfirms the \"AGASA excess\", the status of this model\nwill be changed. Even in this case, the Auger detector\nhas the great potential to confirm or to reject the SHDM\nmodel for UHECRs by testing its clearest signature, the\nanisotropy towards the galactic center.\nOne must clearly emphasize the following.\nThe observations of UHECR cannot exclude SHDM\nas explanation for the dark matter in the universe and in\nour galaxy. Assuming that the SHDM are gravitationally\nproduced, the mass of the X particles is fixed and the\n\nonly free parameter of the SHDM model is the life-time\n\u03c4X . The \"AGASA excess\" fixes this parameter as \u03c4X \u2248\n1020 years.\n\u00bfFrom the HiRes, Fly's Eye and Yakutsk data, that\nare compatible with the GZK cutoff, only a lower bound\non \u03c4X can be derived. Within this lower bound, SHDM\nmay still provide subdominant, but observable effects in\nUHECR observations, and some of the showers observed\nat the highest energies could be induced by secondaries\nfrom X decays. Thus the search for photons coming from\ndirections close to the galactic center remains an interesting task for the Auger detector, even if the \"AGASA\nexcess\" will be not confirmed.\nThe discussion above determines the strategy of this\npaper. In Section II, we obtain more accurately than\nin our previous work [22] the ratio \u03b3/N for the SHDM\n< 1 \u00d7 1020 eV is\nmodel. Note, that the nucleon flux at E \u223c\ngiven mostly by extragalactic protons and thus our prediction is determined by the AGASA excess (see Fig. 1)\nand valid only for the AGASA data. We compare our\nprediction with existing analyses of the \u03b3/p ratio using\nthe AGASA data. The Yakutsk or HiRes data require a\nlarger value for \u03c4X due to their agreement with the GZK\ncutoff and thus the \u03b3/p ratio derived for the AGASA\ndata is in this case an upper limit , not a prediction. In\nSection 3, we calculate the anisotropy of UHECRs from\nSHDM relevant for Auger observations, before we conclude.\nII.\n\nRESTRICTIONS FROM PHOTON-INDUCED\nSHOWERS\n\nIn Ref. [22] we have calculated the ratio r\u03b3/N (x) of\nphotons to nucleons in the QCD cascade initiated by the\ndecay of a X particle as function of x = 2E/mX . Here we\nshall compute \u03b5\u03b3 (E) = (\u03b3/tot)E as the ratio of photoninduced showers to the total number of showers at the\nmeasured energy E using the following set of equations,\n\u03b5\u03b3 (E) =\n\nJpshdm (E)\n\nJ\u03b3shdm (\u03bbE)\n,\n+ Jpextr (E) + J\u03b3shdm (\u03bbE)\n\n(1)\n\nJ\u03b3shdm (\u03bbE) + Jpshdm (E) + Jpextr (E) = JAGASA (E), (2)\nJ\u03b3shdm (E)/Jpshdm (E) = r\u03b3/N (x),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the diffuse fluxes J(E) with indices 'shdm' and\n'extr' refer to SHDM and extragalactic fluxes, respectively. The SHDM fluxes are taken as average over the\ngalactic directions observed by AGASA. As extragalactic\nproton flux we use the universal spectrum from Ref. [29]\nas shown in Fig. 1. The SHDM spectra J\u03b3shdm (E) and\nJpshdm (E) are taken from Ref. [22] (not using the powerlaw approximation). The photon flux J\u03b3 is evaluated at\nthe energy \u03bbE, where E is the energy determined experimentally assuming that the primary is a proton. The coefficient \u03bb takes into account the differences in the shower\n\n\f4\ndevelopment between showers initiated by protons and\nby photons. These differences are caused mainly by the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect.\n> 1\u00d7\nEquation (2) normalizes the total flux at E \u223c\n1020 eV to the observed \"AGASA excess\" (see Fig. 1).\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n[32]\n\n0.6\n\n[33]\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n19\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\n21\n\n10\n\nE (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: Predicted ratio \u03b5\u03b3 as function of the observed energy\nfor mX = 1 \u00d7 1013 GeV and for different values of the \u03bb\nparameter. The solid curve corresponds to \u03bb = 1.2, valid\naccording to Ref. [30, 31] for the AGASA site. The two limits\nin the figure are those obtained in [31] (\u03b5 = 0.67) and in [32]\n(\u03b5 = 0.50) from an analysis of the AGASA data.\n\nThe predicted ratio (1) is shown in Fig. 2 as function\nof the observed energy E for mX = 1 \u00d7 1013 GeV and\nfor various values of \u03bb. This factor depends both on the\nlocal geomagnetic field and the detector type and varies\ntherefore from experiment to experiment. In Refs. [30,\n31], the effective \u03bb was estimated as 1.2 \u2013 1.3 for the\nAGASA site, while Ref. [34] estimated \u03bb = 2 for AUGER.\nThe analysis of AGASA data at E \u2265 1 \u00d7 1020 eV\nresulted in the following upper limits: \u03b5\u03b3 < 0.67 at\nE \u2265 1.25 \u00d7 1020 eV at 95% CL in Ref. [31] and \u03b5\u03b3 < 0.5\nat E \u2265 1.0 \u00d7 1020 eV at 95% CL in Ref. [32].\nThree remarks are in order.\n\u2022 The energy calibration of different experiments by\nthe position of the dip in the energy spectrum [35]\nrequires a shift of the AGASA energies by the factor 0.9 and of the HiRes energies by the factor 1.2.\nThese shifts lead to a very good agreement of the\nAGASA and the HiRes data. Such a shift decreases\nfurther the tension between our prediction of \u03b5\u03b3 and\nthe upper limits from Ref. [31, 32].\n\u2022 From the Yakutsk and HiRes data we cannot obtain a prediction for the \u03b3/p ratio within the SHDM\nmodel, instead we obtain only an upper limit.\nThese data agree with the GZK cutoff and can result only in the lower limit on \u03c4X , and thus in the\nupper limit on the UHE photon flux from SHDM.\nOn the other hand, Jextr is fixed independently, and\nthus our calculations give only an upper limit on\n\n\u03b3/p, which is lower than the curves in Fig. 2 obtained using the AGASA data.\n\u2022 Is it possible to use the combined AGASA and\nYakutsk data for the \u03b3/p ratio as constraint on\nthe SHDM model for UHECRs? Such a combination is possible but requires additional assumptions\nhow this combination is performed. One possibility is to determine the true UHECR flux averaging appropriately the AGASA and Yakutsk data.\nThen the SHDM flux would be lower than the one\nshown in Fig. 1. Consequently, the predicted \u03b3/p\nratio would be also reduced, but could now be compared with the limit \u03b3/p \u2264 0.36 from the combined AGASA-Yakutsk data [32]. Another way to\ninclude the Yakutsk data in our analysis is to assume that the lower flux measured by Yakutsk is\ncaused by a statistical fluctuation. This assumption raises the question of the compatibility of the\nmeasured AGASA and Yakutsk fluxes. The fluxes\nof the two experiments are already incompatible\nat lower energies, 1019 \u2212 1020 eV, where the event\nnumbers are high. Thus their difference cannot be\nexplained simply by statistical fluctuations. Normalization by the dip [35] results in an energy shift\nof the AGASA and Yakutsk energies by a factor\n0.9 and 0.75, respectively. After this procedure the\nfluxes coincide perfectly. This implies that the energies of two Yakutsk events are considerably below\n1 \u00d7 1020 , and hence the upper limit \u03b3/p increases\ncompared to the one given in Ref. [32].\nWe thus conclude that the obtained upper limits on\n\u03b5\u03b3 (see Fig. 2) do not exclude, but disfavor the SHDM\nmodel as explanation for the UHECRs.\nIII.\n\nANISOTROPY\n\nThe anisotropy in the direction to the GC is the most\nreliable prediction of the SHDM model. Here we shall\npresent the detailed calculations of this anisotropy in the\nform convenient for an analysis of the Auger data.\nThe angular dependence of the UHECR flux from\nSHDM is given by\n1\nJshdm (\u03b8) =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nrmax (\u03b8)\n\ndr \u1e45X (R) ,\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nwhere r and R are the distances from the Sun and the\nGC, respectively, and \u1e45X is the rate of X particle decays\ngiven by nX (R)/\u03c4X . As distributions of the DM in the\ngalactic halo we use the NFW [25] and Moore et al. [26]\nprofiles,\nnX (R) =\n\nn0\n,\n(R/Rs )\u03b1 (1 + R/Rs )3\u2212\u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03b1 = 1 and 1.5 for the NFW and Moore et al. profile,\nrespectively.

[18].\n\n\f5\nThe distance to the boundary of halo in the direction \u03b8\nis given by\nq\n2 sin2 \u03b8,\nrmax (\u03b8) = r\u2299 cos \u03b8 + Rh2 \u2212 r\u2299\n(6)\n\nwhere Rh = 100 kpc is the size of the DM halo and\nr\u2299 = 8.5 kpc the distance of the Sun to the GC.\n\nChanging variable r \u2192 R in the integral of Eq.

They are naturally\nproduced in the expanding universe via gravitational\ninteractions, when the Hubble parameter H(t) exceeds\n> mX . The observed density of DM,\ntheir mass, H(t) \u223c\n\u03a9m = 0.27, determines the mass of the particle as\nmX \u223c (a few) \u00d7 1013 GeV.
