We assume that system (1) exhibits a periodic orbit\n\u0393 := {\u03b3(t) | 0 \u2264 t < T } \u2282 U with period T > 0. As usual we will denote by \u03c6(t, p)\nthe flow solution of (1) such that \u03c6(0, p) = p, by xi the ith component of the point\nx, that is, x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )T and analogously X = (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn )T , where T\ndenotes transposition.\nIt is well known that to determine the behavior of the flow near \u0393, a first step\nis to get the characteristic multipliers associated to this orbit. These multipliers\nare usually obtained through the study of the first order variational equations. In\nthis paper we propose an alternative way for obtaining them which works when \u0393\nis given by the transversal intersection of n \u2212 1 codimension one hypersurfaces.\nRecall that the behavior near \u0393 is given by the Poincar\u00e9 map, which is defined in\na section \u03a3 through a point p \u2208 \u0393, where \u03a3 passes through p and is a local smooth\nmanifold of dimension n \u2212 1 transversal to \u0393. Given a section \u03a3, the Poincar\u00e9 map\nis defined as:\n\u03a0 : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 \u03a3\nq 7\u2192 \u03c6(\u03c4 (q), q),\nwhere \u03c4 (q) is the unique real function such that \u03c6(\u03c4 (q), q) \u2208 \u03a3 and lim \u03c4 (q) = T .\nq\u2192p\n\nThe n \u2212 1 eigenvalues of D\u03a0(p) are independent of p and \u03a3 and are called the\ncharacteristic multipliers of \u0393. It is well known that the stable (respectively, unstable) manifold associated to \u0393 has dimension the number of characteristic multipliers\nwith modulus smaller than 1 (respectively, bigger that 1). It is also well known,\nsee [8], that if all the characteristic multipliers have modulus lower than or equal to\n1, then \u0393 is Liapunov stable and if all the characteristic multipliers have modulus\nstrictly lower than 1, then it is asymptotically stable.\nOur result is motivated from a previous result given in [5] for planar differential\nsystems. Recall that in the planar case there is only one characteristic multiplier\nwhich is given by:\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\nT\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a0 (p) = exp\n\ndiv(X)(\u03b3(t)) dt ,\n\n0\n\nwhere div(X) = \u2202X1 /\u2202x1 +\u2202X2 /\u2202x2 is the divergence of the system, see for instance\n[10, p. 214]. In [5], the authors give an alternative expression for the same value\n2\n\n\f\u03a0\u2032 (p). Let us consider an invariant curve f (x1 , x2 ) = 0 for a planar system (1),\nthat is a curve defined by a real C 1 (U)\u2013function f (x1 , x2 ), for which there exists a\nfunction k(x1 , x2 ) : U \u2286 R2 \u2192 R of class C 1 satisfying that:\nDf (x) X(x) = \u2207f (x) * X(x)T = k(x) f (x),\nwhere \u2207f = (\u2202f /\u2202x1 , \u2202f /\u2202x2 ). Under these assumptions, the function k(x1 , x2 ) is\ncalled the cofactor associated to the invariant curve f (x1 , x2 ) = 0.\nProposition 1 [5] Consider system (1) with n = 2 and a periodic orbit \u0393 =\n{\u03b3(t) | 0 \u2264 t < T } contained in a planar invariant curve f (x1 , x2 ) = 0. If \u2207f\ndoes not vanish on \u0393, then\n\u001aZ T\n\u001b\n\u2032\n\u03a0 (p) = exp\nk(\u03b3(t)) dt .\n0\n\nThe above result allows to compute the characteristic multiplier associated to \u0393\nthrough the integration over the cofactor associated to an invariant curve containing the periodic orbit. In Theorem 2, we extend this result to periodic orbits in Rn\ngiven as the transversal intersection of n \u2212 1 codimension one hypersurfaces.\nTheorem 2 Let \u0393 = {\u03b3(t) | 0 \u2264 t < T } be a T \u2212periodic solution of (1). Consider\na smooth function f : U \u2286 Rn \u2192 Rn\u22121 , f = (f1 , f2 , . . . , fn\u22121 )T , such that:\n\\\n- \u0393 is contained in\n{fi (x) = 0},\ni=1,2,...,n\u22121\n\n- the crossings of all the manifolds {fi (x) = 0} for i = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 are\ntransversal over \u0393,\n- there exists a (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix k(x) of real functions satisfying:\nDf(x) X(x) = k(x) f(x).\n\n(2)\n\nLet v(t) be the (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) fundamental matrix solution of\ndv(t)\n= k(\u03b3(t)) v(t),\ndt\n\nv(0) = Id.\n\nThen the characteristic multipliers of \u0393 are the eigenvalues of v(T ).\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fIndeed in the proof of this theorem, we will deduce that the matrices v(T ) and\nD\u03a0(p) are conjugated. On the other hand, recall that the usual way of computing the characteristic multipliers of \u0393 lies in finding the fundamental matrix u(T ),\nsolution of the variational equation:\ndu(t)\n= DX(\u03b3(t)) u(t),\nu(0) = Id,\n(4)\ndt\nwhich is a n \u00d7 n matrix having eigenvalues 1 and the n \u2212 1 characteristic multipliers\nof \u0393.\nNote that the assumptions stated in our theorem are straightforward generalizations of the notion of invariant curve containing the periodic orbit \u0393 for a system\nin dimension n and the integration of the cofactor, which in Rn consists on solving\nthe linear differential system v\u2032 (t) = k(\u03b3(t)) v(t).\nNext section is devoted to prove the above theorem. Finally, in Section 3 we\napply it to study the stability of the periodic orbits of several differential equations.\nExample 1 is devoted to study a 4-dimensional polynomial system, that includes\ntwo systems studied in [4], exhibiting an explicit periodic orbit. Example 2 shows a\n3-dimensional polynomial system for which we prove that the stability of the given\nperiodic orbit is equivalent to the study of the stability of the Mathieu's equation.\nThe last example deals with a more involved case, a 6-dimensional system that\ncontrols the dynamics of a rigid body. In our approach, and by using the existence\nof three independent first integrals, we reduce the study of the stability of the\nSteklov periodic orbit to the study of a second order linear differential equation.\nThis Steklov orbit is introduced in [11]. It is worth to say that in all the above\nexamples we have also tried to use the usual approach, namely the variational\nequations, for studying the stability of the given periodic orbit and we have found\nthat the result of Theorem 2 makes the computations easier.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 2\n\nFix a point p \u2208 \u0393. To prove the result we consider the Poincar\u00e9 section given by\nthe (n \u2212 1)\u2212dimensional orthogonal hyperplane to X(p),\n\u03a3 =< X(p) >\u22a5 =< e1 , . . . en\u22121 > .\nTake a new system of coordinates centered at p with basis e1 , . . . en\u22121 , X(p).\nThese new coordinates write as y = A(x \u2212 p), for some invertible matrix A. By\nusing them the differential equation (1) is converted into\ndy\n= Y(y) := AX(A\u22121 y + p),\ndt\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fand the manifold containing \u0393 is given by g(y) := f(A\u22121 y + p) = 0, which satisfies\nDg(y) Y(y) = k\u0303(y) g(y),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k\u0303(y) := k(A\u22121 y + p), because by using (2), the following equality holds:\nDf(A\u22121 y + p) A\u22121 A X(A\u22121 y + p) = k(A\u22121 y + p) f(A\u22121 y + p).\nRecall that \u03c6(t, p) is the solution of (1) such that when t = 0 passes through\np. Let \u03c8(t, q) be the solution of (5) such that when t = 0 passes through q. Then\n\u03c8(t, q) = A[\u03c6(t, A\u22121 q + p) \u2212 p].\nIn these new coordinates note that \u03a3 = {yn = 0} and if q = (y1, y2 , . . . , yn\u22121, 0)T \u2208\n\u03a3 then the Poincar\u00e9 map \u03a0 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 writes as\n\u03a0(q) = (\u03c81 (\u03c4 (q), q), \u03c82 (\u03c4 (q), q), . . . , \u03c8n\u22121 (\u03c4 (q), q), 0)T ,\nwhere \u03c4 (q) is precisely the time such that \u03c8n ((\u03c4 (q), q)) = 0, which is known to be\na smooth function. Indeed we can identify \u03a0 with a map \u03a0\u0303 from Rn\u22121 into itself\nwith variables y1 , . . . , yn\u22121, defined as\n\u03a0\u0303(y1 , . . . , yn\u22121 ) = (\u03a01 (y1, . . . , yn\u22121 , 0), . . . , \u03a0n\u22121 (y1 , . . . , yn\u22121, 0))T .\nObserve also that the hypotheses on the transversal cutting of \u0393 and the hypersurfaces fi (x) = 0 imply that extended map, f\u0302 = (f1 , f2 , . . . , fn\u22121 , fn ), where\nfn (x) := X1 (p)x1 + X2 (p)x2 + * * * Xn (p)xn is such that det(D f\u0302(p)) 6= 0. This information translated to the function g(y) implies that the matrix Dg(0) has rank n\u22121\nand that a minor with determinant different from zero is the one corresponding to\nthe partial derivatives with respect to y1 , y2 , . . . , yn\u22121 .\nOn the other hand, by using (6) we have that:\n\u2202g (\u03c8(t, q))\n\u2202 (\u03c8(t, q))\n= Dg (\u03c8(t, q))\n= Dg (\u03c8(t, q)) Y (\u03c8(t, q))\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n= k\u0303 (\u03c8(t, q)) g (\u03c8(t, q)) ,\nfor any point q in the domain of definition of (5).\nLet v(t; q) be the fundamental matrix solution of\ndv(t)\n= k\u0303 (\u03c8(t, q)) v(t).\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nThus g (\u03c8(t, q)) = v(t; q) g(q), because the function g (\u03c8(t, q)) is a solution of the\nsame linear differential system and satisfies that g (\u03c8(0, q)) = g (q) .\nConsider a point q \u2208 \u03a3. In these coordinates, we have q = (q1 , q2 , . . . , qn\u22121 , 0)T .\nWe define z = (q1 , q2 , . . . , qn\u22121 )T and h(z) = (z T , 0)T = q like the inclusion of z as\n5\n\n\fa point in the domain of definition of (5). Since \u03a0(q) = \u03c8(\u03c4 (q), q), by the above\nresult we have that g (\u03a0(q)) = v (\u03c4 (q), q) g(z), or equivalently that\n\u0010\n\u0011\ng h(\u03a0\u0303(z)) = v (\u03c4 (h(z)); h(z)) g(h(z)).\nWe differentiate the previous identity with respect to z:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nDg h(\u03a0\u0303(z)) Dh(\u03a0\u0303(z)) D \u03a0\u0303(z) = D [v (\u03c4 (h(z)); h(z))] g(h(z)) +\n+\n\nv (\u03c4 (h(z)); h(z)) Dg(h(z)) Dh(z).\n\nBy evaluating at z = 0, which corresponds exactly to the point p \u2208 \u0393, and using\nthat g(h(0)) = 0, h(0) = (0T , 0)T , \u03c4 (0) = T, \u03a0\u0303(0) = 0 and the expression of h, we\nobtain that:\nDz g(0) D \u03a0\u0303(0) = v (T ; h(0)) Dz g(0),\nwhere Dz g(0) := Dg(h(0)) Dh(0) is precisely the invertible squared matrix formed\nby the derivative of g only with respect to q1 , . . . , qn\u22121 . Hence we have that the\ncharacteristic multipliers associated to \u0393 coincide with the eigenvalues of v(T ; 0)\nbecause the matrices D \u03a0\u0303(0) and v(T ; h(0)) are similar.\nFinally note that k\u0303(\u03c8(t, h(0))) = k(A\u22121 \u03c8(t, h(0)) + p) = k(\u03c6(t, p)). Thus equation (7) is the same that\ndv(t)\n= k(\u03b3(t)) v(t),\ndt\nand v (T ; h(0)) coincides with the matrix v(T ) as defined in (3), as we wanted to\nprove.\n\n3\n\nSome examples and applications.\n\nExample 1. The following example is an extension of two systems extracted\nfrom [4]. The goal of the examples given in [4] is to illustrate that the asymptotic\nstability of a periodic orbit of a system (1) is not determined by the eigenvalues of\nthe matrix defining the first variational equation.\nWe consider the following differential system in R4 :\n\u0001\n\u1e8b = \u2212y \u2212 x x2 + y 2 \u2212 1 ,\n\u0001\n\u1e8f = x \u2212 y x2 + y 2 \u2212 1 ,\n(8)\n\u0001\n\u017c = \u2212w \u2212 s z z 2 + w 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 s k (x \u2212 z) ,\n\u0001\n\u1e87 = z \u2212 s w z 2 + w 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 s k (y \u2212 w) ,\nwith s, k real parameters. This system coincides with the first example given in\n[4] when s = 1 and with the second example when s = \u22121. We note that\n6\n\n\fthis system always exhibits the periodic orbit \u0393 = {\u03b3(t) : 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0} , where\n\u03b3(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), cos(t), sin(t)). We are able to compute all the characteristic\nmultipliers associated to \u0393 for any real value of the parameters s and k. We consider\nthe hypersurfaces fi (x, y, z, w) = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, given by: f1 (x, y, z, w) = x2 + y 2 \u22121,\nf2 (x, y, z, w) = x \u2212 z and f3 (x, y, z, w) = y \u2212 w. We denote by f = (f1 , f2 , f3 ).\nIt is easy to see that \u0393 is contained in the intersection of these three hypersurfaces\nand that the crossings of these hypersurfaces are normal over the periodic orbit \u0393,\nas the computation of the following determinant shows:\n\u2207f1 (\u03b3(t))\n\n\u2207f2 (\u03b3(t))\n\n\u2207f3 (\u03b3(t))\nX(\u03b3(t))\n\n2 cos(t) 2 sin(t)\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2212 sin(t)\n\ncos(t)\n\n=\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n= 4 6= 0.\n\n\u2212 sin(t) cos(t)\n\nStraightforward computations show that Df(x) X(x) = k(x) f(x), with the following matrix of cofactors:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22122 (x2 + y 2 )\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nsz \u2212 x\ns k \u2212 s z (x + z) \u22121 \u2212 s z (y + w) \uf8f8 ,\nk(x, y, z, w) := \uf8ed\nsw \u2212y\n\n1 \u2212 s w (x + z)\n\ns k \u2212 s w (y + w)\n\nwhich evaluated on the periodic orbit \u0393 reads for:\n\uf8eb\n\u22122\n0\n\uf8ec\nk(\u03b3(t)) = \uf8ed (s \u2212 1) cos(t) s (k \u2212 2 cos2 (t))\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\u22121 \u2212 2s cos(t) sin(t) \uf8f8 .\n\u0001\n(s \u2212 1) sin(t) 1 \u2212 2s cos(t) sin(t)\ns k \u2212 2 sin2 (t)\n\nThe fundamental matrix solution of the linear equation v\u2032 (t) = k(\u03b3(t)) v(t) is:\n\u2022 when 2 \u2212 2s + sk 6= 0,\n\uf8eb\n\ne\u22122t\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec\n\u0013\n\u0012 (2\u22122s+ks) t\n\uf8ec\ne\n\u2212\n1\n\u22122t\n\uf8ec (s \u2212 1) e\ncos(t) e(k\u22122)st cos(t) \u2212ekst sin(t)\nv(t) = \uf8ec\n2\n\u2212\n2s\n+\nks\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u0012 (2\u22122s+ks) t\n\u0013\n\uf8ed\ne\n\u22121\n\u22122t\n(s \u2212 1) e\nsin(t) e(k\u22122)st sin(t) ekst cos(t)\n2 \u2212 2s + ks\n\n\u2022 when 2 \u2212 2s + sk = 0, we put k = 2(s \u2212 1)/s:\n\uf8eb\ne\u22122t\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\u22122t\n\u22122t\n2(s\u22121)t\nsin(t)\nv(t) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed (s \u2212 1) e t cos(t) e cos(t) \u2212e\n(s \u2212 1) e\u22122t t sin(t) e\u22122t sin(t) e2(s\u22121)t cos(t)\n7\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\fWe can compute the eigenvalues of the matrix v(2\u03c0), which by Theorem 2, correspond to the characteristic multipliers associated to \u0393. These eigenvalues are:\n\u2022 when 2 \u2212 2s + sk 6= 0: e\u22124\u03c0 , e2s(k\u22122)\u03c0 and e2ks\u03c0 ,\n\u2022 when k = 2(s \u2212 1)/s: e\u22124\u03c0 , e\u22124\u03c0 and e4\u03c0(s\u22121) .\nTherefore, for instance in the first case (2\u22122s+sk 6= 0) when s k > 0 or s (k \u22122) > 0\nwe have that \u0393 is unstable and, in the second case (2 \u2212 2s + sk = 0) when s < 1\nthen \u0393 is Liapunov unstable.\nExample 2. We give an example related to the Mathieu's equation. The\nMathieu's equation is a particular case of the Hill's equation and it has the form:\nv \u2032\u2032 (t) + (a + 2q cos(2t)) v(t) = 0,\nwhere a, q are real parameters. See, for instance, the book [6, pp. 121\u2013131] for\nfurther information about the Hill's equation.\nWe consider the following differential system in R3 :\n\u1e8b = \u2212y + z x/2,\n\u1e8f = x + z y/2,\n\n(9)\n\n\u017c = (\u22122q(x2 \u2212 y 2) \u2212 a) (x2 + y 2 \u2212 1) + z 2 ,\nwhere a, q \u2208 R. This system has the 2\u03c0\u2013periodic orbit \u0393 := {\u03b3(t) | 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0} with\n\u03b3(t) = (cos t, sin t, 0).\nWe consider the surfaces given by fi (x, y, z) = 0, i = 1, 2, with f(x, y, z) =\nT\n2\n(x + y 2 \u2212 1, z) . Their intersection gives the periodic orbit \u0393 and the crossings\nover it are transversal, as the following computation shows:\n\u2207f1 (\u03b3(t))\n\n\u2207f2 (\u03b3(t))\nX(\u03b3(t))\n\n2 cos(t) 2 sin(t) 0\n=\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2212 sin(t)\n\ncos(t)\n\n0\n\n= \u22122 6= 0.\n\nWe have that Df(x) X(x) = k(x) f(x), with the following matrix of cofactors:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\nx2 + y 2\n.\nk(x, y, z) :=\n\u22122q(x2 \u2212 y 2 ) \u2212 a\nz\nTherefore, the cofactor matrix over the periodic orbit reads for:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n1\n,\nk(\u03b3(t)) =\nM(t) 0\n8\n\n\fwhere we denote M(t) := \u22122q cos(2t) \u2212 a.\nBy Theorem 2, the stability of \u0393 is given by the eigenvalues of v(2\u03c0), where v(t)\nis the fundamental matrix solution of\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\nv11 (t) v12\n(t)\n0\n1\nv11 (t) v12 (t)\n=\n.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nv21\n(t) v22\n(t)\nM(t) 0\nv21 (t) v22 (t)\nHence,\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2022 v11\n(t) = M(t) v11 (t) which is the Mathieu's equation with initial conditions\n\u2032\nv11 (0) = 1 and v11\n(0) = 0, and\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2022 v12\n(t) = M(t) v12 (t) which is the Mathieu's equation with initial conditions\n\u2032\nv12 (0) = 0 and v12\n(0) = 1.\n\nWe have that the system v\u2032 (t) = k(\u03b3(t)) v(t) coincides with the characteristic system associated to the Mathieu's equation. Then the stability of the 2\u03c0\u2013periodic\norbit \u0393 := {\u03b3(t) | 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0} with \u03b3(t) = (cos t, sin t, 0) of system (9) coincides\nwith the stability of the Mathieu's equation, which is studied in [3] and [6, pp.\n128\u2013130].\nExample 3. Our third example consists on the study of a periodic solution\nrelated to rigid body dynamics encountered by Steklov [11]. We consider the motion\nof a rigid body around a fixed point in a uniform gravity field. We denote the weight\nof the body by W and the distance between the center of gravity and the fixed point\nby l. As described in the work [9], we can consider two frames of reference both\nwith the origin at the moving body. The first frame OXY Z is fixed and has axis\nOZ vertical and upward directed. The second frame of reference is moving solidary\nwith the body and its axes Ox, Oy and Oz are directed along the major axes of\ninertia for the point O, with corresponding moments of inertia denoted by a, b and\nc. We denote by p, q and r the components of the angular velocity vector of the\nmovement and by \u03b31 , \u03b32 and \u03b33 , the components of the unit vector in the direction\nOZ written in coordinates Oxyz. Steklov considered the case in which the center\nof mass is located on the major axis of inertia, which we assume to be the Ox\u2013axis.\nThe Euler\u2013Poisson equations describe the motion of the rigid body:\n\u1e57 =\n\n(b \u2212 c)\n(c \u2212 a)\nWl\n(a \u2212 b)\nWl\nq r, q\u0307 =\npr +\n\u03b33 , \u1e59 =\npq \u2212\n\u03b32 ,\na\nb\nb\nc\nc\n\u03b3 \u03071 = r \u03b32 \u2212 q \u03b33 ,\n\u03b3 \u03072 = p \u03b33 \u2212 r \u03b31 ,\n\u03b3 \u03073 = q \u03b31 \u2212 p \u03b32 .\n\n(10)\n\nWe are going to assume, without loss of generality and following [9], that:\nb > c,\n\na + b > c,\n\nb + c > a,\n9\n\nc + a > b,\n\nb > a > 2c.\n\n(11)\n\n\fThe general Euler\u2013Poisson equations exhibit three first integrals, whose expressions\nare described in [2]. We are going to rewrite them for the particular case (10). The\nfirst one corresponds to the projection of the angular momentum onto the vertical:\nH1 := a p \u03b31 + b q \u03b32 + c r \u03b33 .\nThe second first integral that we encounter is the geometric property of the vector\n(\u03b31 , \u03b32, \u03b33 ) to be of constant modulus:\nH2 := \u03b312 + \u03b322 + \u03b332 \u2212 1.\nWe also find the full energy (sum of kinetic and potential energies) of the body as\nfirst integral:\nH3 :=\n\n\u0001\n1\n(a2 \u2212 2ab \u2212 2ac + 2bc) W l\na p2 + b q 2 + c r 2 + W l \u03b3 1 +\n.\n2\n2(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 c)\n\nStraightforward computations show that, if we denote by X the vector defined by\nsystem (10), we have \u2207Hi * XT \u2261 0, for i = 1, 2, 3.\nAs described in [9], Steklov in [11] looked for real particular solutions of system\n(10) satisfying the two relations \u03b32 = \u03b22 p q and \u03b33 = \u03b23 rp, with \u03b22 and \u03b23 suitable\nconstants, and he found the following\nparticular periodic solution for system (10).\np\nLet us define the constant \u03bc := W l/a, the dimensionless \"time\" \u03bd := \u03bc (t + t0 ),\nwith t0 an arbitrary constant, and the following constants and variable:\nr\na(a \u2212 2c)\na\na(2b \u2212 a)\nb\u2212a\n1\n2\n\u03b20 :=\n, \u03b21 :=\n, k :=\n, z :=\n\u03bd.\n(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 c)\n(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 c)\nb\u2212c\nk a\u2212c\nThen, the periodic orbit found by Steklov can be written as:\ns\n\u03b20 (2b \u2212 a)\na\np(t) := \u2212\u03bc\ncn(z; k), \u03b31 (t) := 1 \u2212\ncn2 (z; k),\n(a \u2212 c)\na\u2212c\ns\np\n\u03b20 a\nsn(z; k),\n\u03b32 (t) := \u03b21 k sn(z; k) cn(z; k),\nq(t) := \u03bc\n(b \u2212 c)\ns\ns\n\u03b21 a\n\u03b20 (b \u2212 a)\nr(t) := \u03bc\ndn(z; k),\n\u03b33 (t) := \u2212\ncn(z; k) dn(z; k),\n(a \u2212 c)\n(a \u2212 c)\n\n(12)\nwhere cn(z; k), sn(z; k) and dn(z; k) are elliptic Jacobi functions of variable z and\nmodule k.\nWe recall that the module k must always satisfy 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1 and that these elliptic\nJacobi functions are defined as: cn(z; k) = cos(am(z; k)), sn(z; k) = sin(am(z; k))\n10\n\n\fp\nand dn(z; k) =\n1 \u2212 k 2 sin2 (am(z; k)), where am(z; k) is the Jacobi amplitude\ndefined as the inverse function of the elliptic integral of first kind F(w; k), that is,\nam(z; k) = w if and only if F(w; k) = z.\nAs stated in [9], the minimal positive period T of this Steklov solution with\nrespect to the time t is:\nr\na\u2212c\nT = 4 k K(k)\n,\nWl\nwhere K(k) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind. See [1, 12] for further\ninformation about Jacobi elliptic functions and integrals.

Since the system has three functionally independent first integrals,\nit is well known that the 6 \u00d7 6 monodromy matrix computed from the variational\nequations associated to the periodic orbit needs to have at least 4 eigenvalues equal\nto 1. Several works target to the aim of obtaining the remaining two characteristic\nmultipliers following the classical first variational analysis. In [2], a numerical study\nof this particular periodic solution is done and a visualization of it is provided. In\nthe work [9], the problem of orbital stability of the Steklov solution is numerically\nexamined. In [7], it is proved that if a > 1, then this Steklov periodic orbit is\norbitally unstable. In this paper we will see how our method allows to reduce the\ncomputation of these characteristic multipliers to the study of a linear second order\ndifferential equation.\nWe consider the following five hypersurfaces which contain the periodic orbit\ngiven by Steklov:\nf1 :=\nf2 :=\nf3 :=\nf4 :=\nf5 :=\n\n\u0001\n(a2 \u2212 2ab \u2212 2ac + 2bc) W l\n1\na p2 + b q 2 + c r 2 + W l \u03b3 1 +\n= 0,\n2\n2(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 c)\n(a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)\n\u03b32 \u2212\np q = 0,\nW l(a \u2212 2c)\n(a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)\np r = 0,\n\u03b33 \u2212\nW l(a \u2212 2b)\n(b \u2212 c) 2\nW l(a \u2212 2b)\n(a \u2212 b) 2\np +\nr \u2212\n= 0,\n(a \u2212 2c)\na\n(a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)\n(b \u2212 c) 2\nW l(a \u2212 2c)\n(a \u2212 c) 2\np +\nq +\n= 0.\n\u2212\n(a \u2212 2b)\na\n(a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)\n11\n\n\fThe first hypersurface corresponds to one of the described first integrals. The second\nand third hypersurfaces correspond to the ones looked for by Steklov and the last\ntwo hypersurfaces also contain the periodic orbit and are independent from the\nprevious ones. Note that only the first one of the above hypersurfaces is invariant\nby the flow of (10). When we substitute the expressions of the parameterization\n(12), and using (13), we get that each fi values identically zero for any t.\nThe expressions of the other two first integrals in relation with the five polynomials fi are:\nap\nac (a(a \u2212 2c) + 2bc) p\nf1 + b q f2 + c r f3 +\nf4 +\nWl\n2(a \u2212 2b)(b \u2212 c)W l\nab (a(a \u2212 2b) + 2bc) p\nf5 ,\n+\n2(a \u2212 2c)(b \u2212 c)W l\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf1\n2\u03b4p q\n2\u03b4p r\n2\u03b31\n\u2212\nf1 +\n+ f2 f2 +\n+ f3 f3 +\nH2 =\nW l W 2 l2\n(a \u2212 2c)\n(a \u2212 2b)\n\u0012\na\u03b4 (a3 \u2212 a2 b \u2212 2a2 c + abc + 2ac2 \u2212 2bc2 ) p2\n\u2212ac\n+\n+\n+\n(b \u2212 c)W l\n(a \u2212 2b)2 (a \u2212 2c)(b \u2212 c)W l\n\u0013\na2 c2\nac(4ab \u2212 3ac \u2212 2bc + 2c2 )\n+\nf4 +\nf5 f4 +\n4(b \u2212 c)2 W 2 l2\n4(b \u2212 c)2 W 2 l2\n\u0012\na\u03b4 (a3 \u2212 2a2 b + 2ab2 \u2212 a2 c + abc \u2212 2b2 c) p2\n\u2212ab\n+\n+\n+\n(b \u2212 c)W l\n(a \u2212 2b)(a \u2212 2c)2 (b \u2212 c)W l\n\u0013\na2 b2\nac(2ab \u2212 3ac \u2212 2bc + 2c2 )\n+\nf5 \u2212\nf4 f5 ,\n4(b \u2212 c)2 W 2 l2\n4(b \u2212 c)2 W 2 l2\n\nH1 =\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = (a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)/(W l). We note that over the periodic orbit, each one\nof these first integrals does not conform a unique leaf since its coefficients over the\nhypersurfaces fi = 0 are not constants. This assertion means that the intersection\nof any combination of four of the five hypersurfaces fi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the\nset H1 = 0 (equivalently H2 = 0) contains more points than \u0393. This is the reason\nwhy we do not directly use these first integrals in the computations. We have computed the previous expressions because they will lead us to show the existence of\ntwo characteristic multipliers equal to 1.\nThe crossings of the five hypersurfaces fi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are normal over\nthe periodic orbit because the value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the\ngradients of each of the fi in the first five rows and the vector field in the last row,\n\n12\n\n\fall of them evaluated over the periodic orbit (12) is:\n\u0012\n2(b \u2212 c)W 2 l2 2a(a \u2212 2c)(a \u2212 c)\n2a(a \u2212 c)2\ndet =\n+\np(t)2 +\na(a \u2212 c)2\n(b \u2212 a)2\n(2b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 a)\n\n2(2b + 2c \u2212 3a)(a \u2212 c)2 (b \u2212 c)\n2(2b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 c)(b \u2212 c)\nq(t)2 +\nr(t)2 +\na(b \u2212 a)\n(2b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 a)W l\n\u0013\n8(a \u2212 c)(b \u2212 c)W l\n2\n\u03b32 (t) ,\n+\na(2b \u2212 a)\n+\n\nwhich is positive for any t. This assertion is true because the conditions (11) imply\nthat all the coefficients are positive except the term (2b + 2c \u2212 3a), which can be\npositive, negative or zero. If it is positive or zero, we already have that det > 0. If\nit is negative, we are going to show that:\n2a(a \u2212 2c)(a \u2212 c)\n2(3a \u2212 2b \u2212 2c)(a \u2212 c)2 (b \u2212 c)\n\u2212\nr(t)2 > 0\n(b \u2212 a)2\n(2b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 a)W l\nwhich ensures that det > 0 for any value of t.

We note that\nthe first equation of this system is v1\u2032 (t) = 0 which corresponds to the fact that\nf1 is a first integral of the system and gives us that v1 (t) needs to be a constant.\nAnalogously, the other two first integrals give us relations among the values of the\nsolutions of system (15). In particular, from (14), H1 gives us that the function:\na p(t)\nv1 (t) + b q(t) v2 (t) + c r(t) v3(t) +\nWl\nac (a(a \u2212 2c) + 2bc) p(t)\nab (a(a \u2212 2b) + 2bc) p(t)\n+\nv4 (t) +\nv5 (t),\n2(a \u2212 2b)(b \u2212 c)W l\n2(a \u2212 2c)(b \u2212 c)W l\n\nh1 (t) :=\n\nsatisfies h\u20321 (t) \u2261 0 when considered over the solutions of system (15).

We can then derive Hi (\u03b3(t)) with respect to\nt and we deduce the functions hi (t) taking into account that vi (t) is related with\n\u2207fi (\u03b3(t)), i = 1, 2, . . . , 5.\nWe first note that the following constants conform a solution of system (15):\nv1 (t) = 1,\nv4 (t) =\n\na2\n\nv2 (t) = 0,\n\n2(a \u2212 2b)\n,\n\u2212 2ab \u2212 2ac + 2bc\n\nv3 (t) = 0,\n\nv5 (t) =\n\na2\n\n\u22122(a \u2212 2c)\n.\n\u2212 2ab \u2212 2ac + 2bc\n\nThe functions h1 (t) and h2 (t) take the constant values 0 and 4\u03b4/(a2 \u22122ab\u22122ac+2bc),\nwith \u03b4 = (a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 c)/(W l), over this solution, respectively. Since this solution\ntakes a nonzero value on v1 (t), which needs to be constant, we may get the first\ncolumn of the fundamental matrix solution of (15) from the last four columns and\nthis particular constant solution. Hence, we only need to take into account the last\nfour columns of the fundamental matrix solution of (15).\nLet us now consider the fundamental matrix v(t) solution of (15) whose initial\ncondition is the identity matrix. We define vij (t) as the function corresponding\nto row i column j of this fundamental matrix of solutions. Using that the three\nfunctions v1 (t), h1 (t) and h2 (t) are constants, we can obtain certain relations among\nthe rows of this matrix at the value T .\nWe define the constants:\n\u221a\n2 a(b \u2212 c)W l\n2(2b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 c)W l\n\u221a\n,\n, \u03c12 :=\n\u03c11 := \u221a\na(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 2c)3/2\n(b \u2212 a) a \u2212 2c(a2 \u2212 2ab + 2bc)\n\n15\n\n\fand we get that v(T ) equals\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec v21 (T )\nv22 (T )\nv23 (T )\nv24 (T )\nv25 (T )\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nv44 (T ) \u2212 1\nv55 (T ) \u2212 1\n\uf8ec\nv32 (T )\nv33 (T )\n\uf8ec v31 (T )\n\uf8ec\n\u03c11\n\u03c12\n\uf8ec\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8ec\nv55 (T ) \u2212 1\n\uf8ec \u03c1 v (T ) \u03c1 v (T ) \u03c1 (v (T ) \u2212 1)\nv44 (T )\n\u03c11\n1 32\n1\n33\n\uf8ec 1 31\n\u03c12\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8ed\nv44 (T ) \u2212 1\n\u03c12 v31 (T ) \u03c12 v32 (T ) \u03c12 (v33 (T ) \u2212 1) \u03c12\nv55 (T )\n\u03c11\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nThe computation of the characteristic polynomial associated to this matrix gives:\n\u0001\ndet (v(T ) \u2212 \u03bb I) = \u2212(\u03bb \u2212 1)3 \u03bb2 + B \u03bb + C ,\nwhere\n\nB := 2 \u2212 v22 (T ) \u2212 v33 (T ) \u2212 v44 (T ) \u2212 v55 (T ),\nand\nC := v22 (T ) (v33 (T ) + v44 (T ) + v55 (T ) \u2212 2) +\n\u2212 v32 (T ) (v23 (T ) + \u03c11 v24 (T ) + \u03c12 v25 (T )) .\nWe note that each one of the first integrals gives an eigenvalue equal to one. Moreover, using Liouville's formula, we know that the product of all the eigenvalues of\nv(T ) is equal to one because the trace of matrix k(\u03b3(t)) is identically zero and v(t)\nis a fundamental solution of (15). Hence, we get that C = 1. Then, we have that\nthe roots of \u03bb2 + B \u03bb + 1 = 0 are:\n\u2022 if B 2 > 4, then the roots are both real, and one of modulus greater than 1\nand the other with modulus lower than 1: so the Steklov solution is unstable,\n\u2022 if B 2 \u2264 4, then the roots are both of modulus equal to one and the characteristic multipliers do not decide if the Steklov solution is unstable or not.\nLet us go back to the differential linear system (15). We know that v1 (t) is\nconstant, and we denote its value by v10 := v1 (t). Analogously, we denote by\nh10 := h1 (t) and h20 := h2 (t), the values of the other two constants. We can\ndetermine v2 (t) and v3 (t) from the last two equations of (15) and also from the two\nrelations h1 (t) = h10 and h2 (t) = h20 . We equate the two expressions of v2 (t) and\nv3 (t) obtained in these two different ways and we get a linear differential system of\n\n16\n\n\fequations for v4 (t) and v5 (t) which reads for:\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 dn(z; k) \u2032\nab \u2212 2ac + 2bc\nW l(2b \u2212 a)dn(z; k)\n2\nc\u2212\nv4 (t) \u2212\ncn(z; k) v4 (t) +\n\u2202t\na(a \u2212 c)(b \u2212 c)\n2b \u2212 a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(2b \u2212 a)(ab \u2212 ac \u2212 bc)\n2\n+ b\u2212\ncn(z; k) v5 (t) +\n(a \u2212 2c)c\np\n2(b \u2212 c) W l(b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 2c)\n2(b \u2212 c)\n\u221a\nv10 cn(z; k)2 +\n+\ncn(z; k) h10 +\nc\nac 2b \u2212 a\n\u0015\nb\u2212c\n(W l h20 \u2212 2v10 ) = 0,\n+\na\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 sn(z; k) \u2032\nr0 (ab \u2212 ac + bc)\nW l(a \u2212 2c)sn(z; k)\n2\nc\u2212\nv5 (t) +\ncn(z; k) v4 (t) +\n\u2202t\na(b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 c)\n(2b \u2212 a)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(b \u2212 a)(2ab \u2212 ac \u2212 2bc)\n2\n+ b+\ncn(z; k) v5 (t) +\n(a \u2212 2c)(a \u2212 c)\np\n\u22122(b \u2212 c) W l(b \u2212 a)(2b \u2212 a)\n2(b \u2212 a)(b \u2212 c)\n\u221a\ncn(z; k)2 v10 +\n+\ncn(z; k) h10 \u2212\nb(a \u2212 c)\nab a \u2212 2c\n\u0015\nb\u2212c\n+\n(W l h20 \u2212 2v10 ) = 0,\na\n\nwhere r0 = (b \u2212 a)(a \u2212 2c)/(b(a \u2212 c)). Equating v5 (t) from the first equation and\nsubstituting its value in the second one, we get a second order linear differential\nequation for v4 (t) whose fundamental set of solutions would let us to the computation of the characteristic multipliers associated to the Steklov periodic orbit.

The classical approach to this problem is to compute the characteristic multipliers via the first variational equations, thus involving a linear differential\nsystem of order 6. Our method starts with a linear differential system of order 5, see\n(15). In this particular problem, we know three first integrals which let us reduce\nthe order by 3, getting the second\u2013order linear differential equation (16). We note\nthat the use of the first integrals is not trivial, since we need to write them in terms\nof the considered hypersurfaces, see (14), and then relate them to the variables of\nthe linear differential system (15).\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
