In\nits simplest incarnation it is an exact quantum duality type IIb string theory on\nasymptotically AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometries and the maximally supersymmetric Yang\nMills theory on S 3 \u00d7 R. A basic understanding of the symmetries shows that the\nthe isometries of AdS5 \u00d7S 5 given by the global symmetries of the field theory. It\nwas also understood from the very beginning that the radius of curvature of the\ngeometry in string units scales as R4 \u223c gY2 M N , which is the t' Hooft coupling\n[2]. In order to compare the two sides of the duality, one is forced to consider\neither a regime in gravity where R is small and string corrections are large, but\nthe field theory is perturbative, or one has to consider a regime where R is large\nand therefore the field theory is strongly coupled. If moreover one requires that\nthe string coupling constant is small, then N is large.\nAs such, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a strong-weak coupling duality\nfor the 't Hooft coupling. This conjecture generalizes to many other families of\nfour dimensional superconformal field theories. The objective of this paper is\nto explore recent progress on the understanding of the N = 4 SYM at strong\ncoupling and how this understanding also lets us solve to a large extent other\n1\n\n\fconformal field theories in four dimensions at strong coupling. These other\nconformal field theories in gravity result from replacing the five-sphere by some\nSasaki-Einstein manifold [3]. The gist of the argument is that the dominant\ndynamics for all of these cases is a local N = 4 SYM theory in the regions\nof field space that dominate the dynamics [4, 5]. The understanding of these\nspecial regions in field space is done by a self-consistent approximation which\nis essentially non-perturbative. This proposal for strong coupling makes many\ngeometrical aspects of the higher dimensional gravity theory manifest. The\nexpansion also gives a collection of tools that permit one to do various dynamical\ncalculations directly at strong coupling. This permits one to produce a lot of\nevidence justifying the proposed strong coupling expansion.\nThe paper will explore in succession the approximation of strong coupling\nto N = 4 SYM, making emphasis on how degrees of freedom separate into\neigenvalues and off-diagonal degrees of freedom at strong coupling. This division\ncan then be used to show how strings emerge and how one would compute their\nenergies. For other field theories it will then be shown that this same type\nof division of degrees of freedom persists, but where the diagonal degrees of\nfreedom are related to solutions of the moduli space of vacua of the theory. I\nwill also explain briefly how one recovers part of the non-BPS dual supergravity\nspectrum on AdS5 \u00d7 X from this proposal for strong coupling dynamics, as well\nas the future prospects for this approach to understand the AdS/CFT duality.\n\n2\n\nCommuting matrix quantum mechanics and\neigenvalue gases\n\nIn order to understand what happens to N = 4 SYM at strong coupling, it is\nuseful to start with the study of supersymmetric states. These have a chance\nat being protected from weak to strong coupling, not just in how one counts\nthem, but perhaps also to some extent their dynamics will be simple. By using\nthe operator-state correspondence associated to four dimensional field theories\non a sphere times time, one finds that the BPS states that respect one eight\nof the supersymmetries are in one to one correspondence with chiral ring operators in the field theory. At weak coupling one can further use the operator\nstate correspondence to show that these supersymmetric states depend only\non the constant modes of the scalars on the sphere [6, 7] (plus some fermion\npolarizations that we will ignore because fermions do not get classical vacuum\nexpectation values).\nThis suggest that in order to study supersymmetric states it suffices to study\nthe quantum mechanics of the constant modes on the sphere at weak coupling. It\nseems reasonable to assume that this will also hold classically at strong coupling\nand that supersymmetry will make semiclassical arguments exact. The effective\ndynamics of such modes is similar to the dimensional reduction on the sphere.\nThe effective dynamics is given by a truncated action\n\n2\n\n\fS\u223c\n\nZ\n\nTr\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\nX\n1 2\n1\n2\ng\n[X\n,\nX\n]\n(Dt X i )2 \u2212 (X i )2 +\ni\nj\nY\nM\n\uf8fe\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 2\nij\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2X 1\n\uf8f3\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we need to keep the constant mode of the gauge field on the sphere in\norder to impose the gauge constraints on the configurations. The effective mass\nterm arises from the conformal coupling of the scalars to the curvature of S 3 \u00d7R.\nHere we have also have rescaled the field so that the kinetic term is canonical.\nThe factor of 8\u03c0 2 reflects the volume of the S 3 .\nTo analyze this system\u221a\nat strong coupling, we can use a naive large N counting where X is of order N (the typical size of an eigenvalue of a random\nmatrix). We find that the kinetic and quadratic terms are of order N 2 , while\nthe commutator term is of order \u03bbN 2 , where \u03bb is the 't Hooft coupling constant. This suggests that at strong coupling the quartic potential dominates\nthe dynamics, and therefore it should be minimized. The minimization of the\ncommutator potential tells us that the low energy dynamics is dominated by\nconfigurations of commuting matrices. These are quantized with the quadratic\npieces of the action (one can think of this as treating the kinetic term and mass\nterm as a perturbation on the configurations of zero potential).\nThis produces a model of gauged commuting matrix quantum mechanics.\nOne should remember that commuting matrices describe the moduli space of\nvacua of the field theory (they solve the D and F-term constraints). This is\nimportant for generalizations to other quantum field theories.\nThe matrices X are hermitian and they commute, so they can be diagonalized simultaneously by a gauge transformation. The only relevant dynamical\nvariables are the eigenvalues of the matrices themselves. If we make a diagonal ansatz in the classical action, we find that the system appear to be free.\nHowever, when one computes the effective Hamiltonian, one needs to take into\naccount that we have changed variables from general commuting matrices to\ndiagonal matrices, so that the effective Hamiltonian does not have a standard\nLaplacian. Instead it is modified by a measure term, which is the volume of the\ngauge orbit of a configuration [7]. The full answer is given by\nX\n1\n1\n(2)\n\u2212 2 \u2207i \u03bc2 \u2207i + ~x2i\nHef f =\n2\u03bc\n2\ni\nwhere we have a sum over eigenvalues. These are collected into a six vector ~x (we\nhave six matrices), and the eigenvalues are labeled by i (there are N eigenvalues).\nThe measure is given by a generalized Van der Monde determinant\nY\n|~xi \u2212 ~xj |2\n(3)\n\u03bc2 =\ni<j\n\nIt turns out that the Gaussian wave function is an eigenfunction of this Hamiltonian,\n!\nX ~x2\ni\n\u03c80 \u223c exp \u2212\n(4)\n2\ni\n3\n\n\fand that the probability measure on eigenvalue space (given by the square of\nthe wave function times the measure) can be interpreted as a Boltzman gas of\nN particles in six dimensions with a confining quadratic potential and repulsive\nlogarithmic interactions\nX\nX\nlog(|~xi \u2212 ~xj |2 )\n(5)\n~x2i +\np(~x) \u223c exp(\u2212\ni<j\n\ni\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit (large N) one can solve the Boltzmann gas by a\nsaddle point approximation solving for the density of eigenvalues. One finds\nthat the distribution of eigenvalues is singular, concentrated on a sphere [7, 8]\n\u03c1=N\n\n\u03b4(|~x| \u2212 r0 )\nr05 V ol(S 5 )\n\n(6)\n\np\nand r0 = (N/2). One can guess this form by the SO(6) R-symmetry of the\nsystem. This serves as a consistency\ncheck of our analysis, where we said that\n\u221a\nthe matrices where of order N . The size could have been renormalized at\nstrong coupling by a function of \u03bb. This can also be analyzed numerically by\nMonte Carlo methods to see how well the eigenvalue distribution is captured by\nthe saddle point calculation [9].\nThe end result is that the eigenvalues form a five-sphere. This sphere should\nbe identified with the S 5 of the dual gravity theory and suggests an origin for the\nhigher dimensional geometry of the dual theory. Since the geometry is encoded\nnon-trivially in the quantum wave function of the system, this is a setup where\none can talk about emergent geometry in a precise sense.\n\n3\n\nOff-diagonal degrees of freedom and strings\n\nSo far, the discussion has centered on the eigenvalues, and we have ignored all\nother degrees of freedom. The analysis has relied on working in a low energy\nexpansion. Off-diagonal modes should be heavy for this to make sense. One\ncan work with these off-diagonal modes perturbatively. One can check that to\nquadratic order the off-diagonal modes have masses of order m2 \u223c \u03bb which is\ntaken to be large in order to expand at strong coupling.\nBeing more careful, one notices that a typical off-diagonal mode connects two\ndifferent eigenvalues ~xi and ~xj , and one can see that the mass of the off-diagonal\nmodes is given by\nm2ij = 1 + g 2 |~xi \u2212 ~xj |2\n(7)\nwhere g differs from gY M by normalization factors. At strong coupling the one\ncan be dropped, and one finds that the mass is essentially given by the Euclidean\ndistance between the two particles on R6 . Here we interpret eigenvalues as Dparticles in the usual way. One can also imagine drawing an off-diagonal mode\nas a line segment connecting two diagonal degrees of freedom. We see this way\nthat the distance on R6 matters to determine the off-diagonal mode structure,\nand that the metric information in R6 is physical.\n4\n\n\fThe typical diagonal configuration breaks the gauge group to U (1)N , and\nthe off-diagonal modes are charged. Gauge invariance requires that for any\noff-diagonal perturbation entering into a D-particle, there is a corresponding\noff-diagonal perturbation exiting from it. This requires that the off-diagonal\nexcitations form closed polygons, and this suggests that the off-diagonal modes\ngive rise to a structure of excitations that is realized by some form of closed\nstring (at this stage it is a combinatorial approximation to smooth curves on\nS 5 ).\nIndeed, one can use this understanding to show that the energies of strings\nare reproduced exactly[8] in the plane wave limit and also the so-called giant\nmagnon configurations [10] (see also [11]). This shows that the five-sphere has\nthe right size in string units, as one is reproducing the energies of many nontrivial string states. Indeed, the field theory calculation, which is done in a\nsaddle point approximation, suggested that the worldsheet momentum on the\nquantum field theory spin chain model was given by an angle on the sphere. This\nwas verified later in the semiclassical calculation of giant magnons by Hofman\nand Maldacena [12]. One can also study bound states of giant magnons [13] and\nthe strong coupling calculations have a match as well [14], but this is less well\nunderstood since the quantum numbers of the corresponding bound states are\ndifferent.\n\n4\n\nOther N = 1 superconformal field theories\n\nNow that the structure of N = 4 SYM has been understood at strong coupling,\nit is important to see if there is a way to extend the techniques developed in\nthe well known case to other superconformal field theories that are less well\nunderstood. In particular, for many conformal field theories one can check\nexplicitly that there is no weak coupling limit, as the fundamental fields acquire\nlarge anomalous dimensions [16]. This makes any treatment of such theories\ndifficult in general. Some of these issues were overcome in [4]. It was argued\nthat there might be some regimes (regions of field space) in the field theory\nwhere a classical calculation might be valid, even though the field theory is in\ngeneral always strongly coupled. This assumption is in some sense required\nin order to be able to say anything useful for such a field theory. One can\nbegin with a few assumptions regarding this classical regime. These are that\nthe field theory is well described by a classical supersymmetric lagrangian with\na (non-trivial) Kahler potential, a superpotential and super Yang Mills sectors.\nOne can them impose on this classical lagrangian the conditions that lead to a\nsuperconformal classical theory.\nThe assumptions are that each chiral field has an R-charge, and that this is\na holormorphic weight ( which is equal to it's conformal weight). For the kinetic\nterm of the scalar to be invariant under local rescalings of the background metric,\nwe find that the Kahler potential has to be a scaling function of weight (1, 1)\nwith respect to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic degrees of freedom. Also,\none finds a non-minimal coupling of the scalars to the background curvature.\n\n5\n\n\fThis is almost identical to the case of N = 4 SYM.\nOne can also prove that the supersymmetric classical states on a sphere that\nare dual to the chiral ring are simple. They have no gauge field excitations, only\nconstant modes on the sphere are excited and the F and D-terms must vanish.\nThis set of conditions states that up to gauge equivalence they are in one to one\ncorrespondence with the moduli space of vacua of the field theory. This can be\nanalyzed in detail as it depends only on the superpotential of the theory.\nThe upshot of this calculation is that configurations of commuting matrices\nin N = 4 SYM are replaced by configurations on the moduli space of vacua of\nthe theory. These moduli spaces are well understood in some cases, and they\nare for the most part given by a symmetric product\nM = SymN V\n\n(8)\n\nwhere V is a Calabi-Yau cone (these are the situations where the dual gravity\ntheory has Freund-Rubin ansatz [15], and the S 5 has to be replaced by a Sasaki\nEinstein manifold X, so that V is the cone over X). In essence, this is what the\nD-brane moduli space for D-branes near a Calabi-Yau cone singularity should\nlook like. Moreover, it was argued that the metric on V should be Ricci flat.\nIn essence, instead of having a gas of D-particles on R6 , one ends up with a\ngas of D-particles on V . This dynamics follows the axions of D-geometry as described by Douglas, Kato and Ooguri [17]. Basically, away from the singularity\nat the origin, one has an effective dynamics that is locally equivalent (on V ) to\nN = 4 SYM, so that the previous insights can be applied. This is, one finds a\nwindow where one can do effective field theory as one does in N = 4 SYM, but\nwhere the global structure of the moduli space of vacua is modified.\nThe most important effect is that \"off-diagonal\" energies are proportional\nto the distance between D-particles on V , for any pair of particles that is near\neach other, and that this is true for all polarizations. This is how the metric on\nV becomes important.\nTo complete the effective dynamics one also needs an effective Hamiltonian\non the moduli space of vacua. As in the case of N = 4 SYM, the system is\noriginally written in terms of a gauge theory (or collection of general matrices),\nwhereas the notion of D-particles as eigenvalues also requires one to compute\nsome analogue of the volume of the gauge orbit. However, if one tries to understand how this dynamics could be independent of the choice of presentation\nof the field theory under Seiberg dualities [18], one finds that a naive counting\nof the volume of the gauge orbit is not the correct answer. A proposal for this\nmeasure term was provided in joint work with Hartnoll [5]. This proposal is as\nfollows.\nFirst, the measure factorizes, so that\nX\nsij )\n(9)\n\u03bc2 = exp(\u2212\ni<j\n\nand that the functions s satisfy a differential equation on moduli space\n\u2212 \u22076 s(x, x\u2032 ) = 64\u03c0 3 \u03b4 (6) (x, x\u2032 )\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fThis was guessed by noticing that in N = 4 SYM the logarithm in the measure\nsatisfies these properties. Moreover, it was found that in the case of orbifolds,\nthe method of images would give a function that satisfies the same constraints\n[19].\nFrom here, one gets an effective Hamiltonian\n\u0015\nX\u0014 1\n2\n\u2212 2 \u2207i (\u03bc \u2207i ) + Ki\nH=\n(11)\n2\u03bc\ni\nwhere Ki is the Kahler potential of V , and surprisingly, one can also solve the\nground state wave function\nX\nKi )\n(12)\n\u03c80 = exp(\u2212\ni\n\nAgain, one can use the probability density associated to this wave function to\ndetermine the important physical configurations. One has a gas of particles on\nV subject to two body logarithmic repulsions and to an external confining force\n(essentially K acts as a harmonic oscillator potential).\nOne can prove [5] that in\n\u221a the saddle point limit all the D-particles are at\nthe same distance (of order N ) from the tip of the cone, and that they form a\nuniform distribution. This information basically states that in the geometry one\nhas replaced the five sphere with a Sasaki-Einstein metric. It is also possible to\nshow that one reproduces exactly a particular plane wave limit spectrum for all\nX, where the plane wave limit is taken along an R-charge isometry and that this\ndetermination is reliable at a strong effective t'Hooft coupling. This requires\nalso the introduction of short off-diagonal modes.\nThe upshot is a unified dynamics for all of these field theories that singles\nout N = 4 SYM and explains why if N = 4 SYM can be described at strong\ncoupling by type IIB string theory, then this is true also for a host of different\nsuperconformal field theories (exactly those whose moduli space has the requisite\nsymmetric product structure).\n\n5\n\nSupergravity spectrum\n\nIt is instructive to explain how some of the calculations that show the match at\nstrong coupling are done. In particular, a single graviton propagating on AdS5 \u00d7\nX should be considered as a low lying excitation of the system. However, most\ngravitons will also have angular momentum on AdS5 , and they are not captured\nby the truncation to the low lying degrees of freedom we have performed, that\nhas all degrees of freedom constant on the S 3 and therefore they do not carry\nangular momentum. Fortunately, various such gravitons do not carry angular\nmomentum either, and it is possible to compare some of these with particular\nexcitations of the low energy effective system.\nWith the understanding that in the effective field theory we have a finite\nnumber of degrees of freedom, with a Hamiltonian given by equation (11) and\n7\n\n\fthat we have solved the system in terms of wave function of these degrees of\nfreedom (12), to find excitations it would be required to have a wave function\ndescribing these excitations.\nAlso, in the operator language, chiral operators can be described in terms of\ntraces of products of holomorphic fields, where the large N counting suggests\nthat each traces is interpreted as a single graviton. This suggests a form for the\nappropriate wave function of a supergravity mode\n\u03c8 \u223c Tr(f (x))\u03c80\n\n(13)\n\nwhere f is now a function on V . It is also known that in the case of N = 4\nSYM, the f that show up are symmetric traceless combinations of the fields,\nand all of these turn out to be harmonic functions on R6 . The ansatz for a wave\nfunction that we make is that f is a harmonic function on V . Then we can\nreplace this ansatz in the Hamiltonian 11 and verify if it is an eigenfunction or\nnot. We should check this ignoring 1/N corrections.\nThe metric on V is of the form\nds2 = dr2 + r2 dX52\n\n(14)\n\nwhere X 5 is the Sasaki-Einstein metric. This allows for a separation of variables\nin r and X. One finds that harmonic functions on V are related to general\neigenvalues of the laplacian on X. Moreover, one finds that as functions of r,\nthey are scaling functions where h(r) = r\u03bb , and \u03bb is given by\np\n\u03bb = \u22122 + 4 + \u03bd 2\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the eigenvalue of the Laplacian of X. One also finds that the wave\nfunction (13) is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian to a very good approximation, with energy \u03bb over the ground state. This depends on using properties of\nthe saddle point distribution of particles and assuming that the modified wave\nfunction does not alter this distribution too much. This is a good approximation\non the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. Thus the possible values of \u03bb describe the\ndifferent dimensions of operators that are allowed at strong coupling. Notice\nthat we are departing from the traditional idea that operators at strong coupling\nare simply polynomials in the fundamental fields. Instead, the characteristics\nof f determine the spectrum of dimensions of operators in the conformal field\ntheory.\nOne finds a similar formula for the energies of the gravitational fluctuations\nof AdS5 \u00d7 X that mix the five form field strength and the metric and the\nspectrum of the Laplacian on X appears in the same way [20]. Indeed, one can\nmatch exactly half of those modes to the wave functions that we have described\nso far. The harmonic functions that are holomorphic are special, and those\nhappen to be polynomials in the variables describing the algebraic geometry of\nV.\n\n8\n\n\f6\n\nOutlook\n\nSo far, in this review I have described how there is a natural notion of emergent\ngeometry that appears at strong coupling for a large family of superconformal\nfield theories. This notion of geometry provides a simple notion of locality,\nwhich is based on the idea that the energies of off-diagonal degrees of freedom\nconnecting points on the geometry are proportional to the distances in the\ngeometry, so faraway points are decoupled. It was also described that in such\na geometry there is a universal dynamics: it is given by a local N = 4 SYM\non the moduli space of vacua for the relevant configurations. It has also been\nshown that a lot of calculations that were first understood in gravity can now be\nperformed at strong coupling in field theory and that one finds an exact match\nfor a large class of observables.\nHowever, a complete understanding of the AdS/CFT duality is still beyond\nreach. Although one has been able to make good progress on the understanding\nof strongly coupled phenomena (at least as it pertains to the systems studied\nhere), there is still a lot to be done. The radial direction of AdS is understood\nvery poorly, as well as the reason as to why time is warped in the gravitational\ntheory. Although it is possible to get this information from the isometry group\nof AdS, this is a kinematical rather than a dynamical reason. This means\nthat when one breaks conformal invariance one does not have an understanding\nof how this would affect the geometry. There is also a need to understand\nhow heavy objects produce a gravitational interactions. This is something that\nhas not been done so far, although there seems to be no a-priori obstacle to\ndoing these calculations. One should be optimistic about the general prospects\nfor the future understanding of these issues. The techniques that have been\ndeveloped allow for more involved calculations and the fact that there is some\nunderstanding of locality in higher dimensions can help a lot towards developing\nintuition and making setups that have some direct correspondence with the\ngravity theory.\nOne should also be content with the fact that since the developments so far\nhave used very nice looking wave functions, it is not too hard to make simulations of their associated probability densities where direct analytical calculations\nmight be very hard.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank D.
