We calculate\nthe two-point function explicitly and show that it exhibits Poincar\u00e9 recurrences.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nResearch supported in part by the DoE under grant DE-FG05-91ER40627.\nsiopsis@tennessee.edu\n\n1\n\n\fThe information loss paradox following the discovery of Hawking radiation [1] remains\nunresolved despite considerable effort [2\u20134]. In principle, quantum effects in the evolution\nof a black hole should be completely understood within string theory. Since the latter is\na unitary quantum theory containing gravity, one expects that no information loss occurs\nduring the evolution of a black hole. How this emerges in practice, given the existence of a\nhorizon, remains out of reach as calculations become intractable beyond the semi-classical\napproximation.\nCentral to our understanding of the quantum state of a black hole is the BekensteinHawking entropy which seems to be universally given by\nSBH =\n\nAh\n4G\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ah is the area of the horizon and G is Newton's constant. An observer outside\nthe horizon ought to be able to understand this expression in terms of observable matter\nfields. Unfortunately, calculations generally lead to divergent expressions due to the infinite\nblue-shift experienced by an in-falling object near the horizon. To get rid of infinities, 't\nHooft introduced an artificial \"brick wall\" just outside the horizon beyond which a particle\ncannot propagate [5]. It was subsequently understood that infinities may be absorbed by\nthe gravitational constants and the theory was finite when expressed in terms of physical\nparameters as in any renormalizable field theory [6, 7]. The form (1) of the entropy, including\nthese quantum effects, remained unchanged.\nGiven the finiteness of the entropy (once infinities are properly dealt with), one expects\non general grounds that the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem will hold. If we view the matter\nfield outside the horizon as a perturbation, this theorem implies that, once perturbed, the\nsystem will never relax back to its original state. Its evolution will be quasi-periodic with\na large period\ntP \u223c O(eSBH )\n(2)\nFor times t \u226a tP , the system may look like it is decaying back to thermal equilibrium, but\nfor t & tP , it should return to its original state (or close) an infinite number of times.\nThis behavior should be evident in any correlator of matter fields. In the case of an\nasymptotically AdS space-time, the AdS/CFT correspondence [8] offers an additional tool\nin the study of unitarity, because the CFT on the boundary of AdS is a unitary field\ntheory [9\u201315]. It was argued by Solodukhin [15] that quantum effects replace the horizon\nby a wormhole of narrow throat \u223c o(1/tP ). It is then evident from (1) and (2) that these\neffects are non-perturbative [16, 17].\nThere is no similar correspondence principle in asymptotically flat space-times. However, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem should still hold. To lend support to this claim,\nwe shall calculate the two-point function of a massive scalar field in the background of a\ntwo-dimensional dilaton black hole. This is a relatively simple case where explicit expressions can be derived. By concentrating on the dynamics near the horizon, we shall argue\nthat the effective potential is modified by quantum effects. For an explicit calculation, we\nconcentrate on a wormhole modification. However, the results are independent of the detailed shape of the effective potential. We demonstrate that the two-point function exhibits\nPoincar\u00e9 recurrences, as expected.\nThe two-dimensional gravitational action is [18, 19]\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n\u22122\u03c6\n2\n2 \u221a\n(3)\n(R + 4(\u2207\u03c6) + V (\u03c6)) +\nd x \u2212g e\nd2 x \u2212g (R \u2212 2\u039b)\nSgr =\n2\u03c0\n16\u03c0G\n\n2\n\n\fThe first terms provides the dynamics of the dilaton field \u03c6. The second term on the righthand side is the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, in two dimensions it does not contribute\nto the field (Einstein) equations, which is why a dilaton term is needed. For the same\nreason, Newton's constant G is not really a coupling constant. Nevertheless, the entropy of\na two-dimensional black hole receives a contribution of the Bekenstein-Hawking form (1),\nSBH =\n\n1\n4G\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the \"area\" of the horizon is Ah = 1 (single point). An additional contribution is\nprovided by the dilaton field \u03c6, but will not be needed for our purposes.\nA general black hole metric is\nds2 = \u2212f (x)dt2 +\n\ndx2\nf (x)\n\n(5)\n\nThe horizon is located at x = xh , where\nf (xh ) = 0\n\n(6)\n\nThe Hawking temperature is given by\nTH =\n\nf \u2032 (xh )\n4\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nLet us add a minimally coupled massive scalar field \u03c6 of mass m with action\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd2 x \u2212g [(\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 ]\nSmatter =\n2\n\n(8)\n\nAfter integrating over the scalar field in the path integral, we arrive at an effective action\nwhich is divergent. The divergences may be eliminated\nby a Pauli-Villars regularization [7,\n\u221a\n2 + m2 and a pair of scalar fields of\n2M\n20]. If we add\na\nscalar\nfield\nof\n(large)\nmass\nM\n=\n1\n\u221a\nmass M2 = M 2 + m2 each obeying wrong statistics, we obtain the effective action\nZ\n1\nWmatter = d2 x(Aa0 (x) + Ba1 (x) + . . .) ,\na0 (x) = 1 ,\na1 (x) = R\n(9)\n6\nwhere the dots represent finite contributions and\nA=\n\nm2\nM12 M12 m2\nln 2 +\nln 2 ,\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\nM2\nM2\n\nB=\n\n1\nM4\nln 2 2 2\n8\u03c0 m M1\n\n(10)\n\nare coefficients that diverge as M \u2192 \u221e.

We shall calculate the two-point\nfunction of the time derivative of the scalar field, \u03c6\u0307, rather than of the field \u03c6 itself, in order\nto avoid unnecessary complications due to the logarithmic behavior of the two-dimensional\npropagator. The two-point function at temperature TH can be written as\nX\nG(t, z; t\u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2261 h{\u03c6\u0307(t, z) , \u03c6\u0307(t\u2032 , z \u2032 )}iTH =\nG0 (t + in/TH , z; t\u2032 , z \u2032 )\n(35)\nn\n\nin terms of zero-temperature correlators\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\nG0 (t, z; t\u2032 , z \u2032 ) =\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 2 e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t ) \u03a6\u03c9 (z)\u03a6\u2217\u03c9 (z \u2032 )\n\n(36)\n\n0\n\nUsing the approximation (23) near the horizon (which is equivalent to the WKB expression (27) appropriately normalized), we obtain\nG0 (t, z; t\u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2248\n\n1\n1\n+\n2\u03c0(t \u2212 t\u2032 + z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 2\u03c0(t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2212 z + z \u2032 )2\n\n(37)\n\nand after performing the sum in (35),\nG(t, z; t\u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2248\n\n\u03c0TH2\n\u03c0TH2\n+\n2 sinh2 \u03c0TH (t \u2212 t\u2032 + z \u2212 z \u2032 ) 2 sinh2 \u03c0TH (t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2212 z + z \u2032 )\n\n(38)\n\nEvidently, the two-point function decays exponentially as t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e. This cannot be the\ncase if the entropy of the system is finite. To see this explicitly, let us set z = z \u2032 and t\u2032 = 0\nto simplify the notation. The two-point function behaves asymptotically for large t > 0 as\nG(t) \u2261 G(t, z; 0, z) \u2248 4\u03c0TH2 e\u22122\u03c0TH t\nThis expression is a valid approximation for t \u226b t0 , where t0 =\naverage\nZ\n1 T\n|G(t)|2\n2\ndt\nh|G| i \u2261 lim\nT \u2192\u221e T t0\n|G(t0 )|2\n\n6\n\n(39)\n1\n\u03c0TH .\n\nThe normalized time\n(40)\n\n\fvanishes for an exponentially decaying G(t). However, in a system of finite entropy S, one\nobtains\nh|G|2 i \u223c e\u2212S\n(41)\nunder general assumptions [22, 23]. In calculating the two-point function we ignored regularization issues and therefore implicitly worked in the S \u2192 \u221e limit, hence our result\nh|G|2 i = 0 following from eq. (39). Quantum effects include the contributions of the PauliVillars fields and the gravitational field yielding a finite density of states near the horizon.\nThey enter the definition of Green functions and therefore alter the wave equation (17) by\nmodifying the effective potential. The resulting potential must admit bound states. To\ncalculate these quantum effects, we shall adopt a specific form of the potential, however\nthe results to leading order will be independent of the details of the shape of the effective\npotential.\nWe shall assume that the effective potential changes because of a change in the metric\ndue to quantum effects amounting to\nlim gtt = \u2212\u03bb2\n\n(42)\n\nx\u2192xh\n\nthus replacing the horizon with the narrow throat of a wormhole [15].

We argued that quantum effects altered the effective potential\nreplacing the horizon by the narrow throat of a wormhole, following a similar argument\nin three-dimensional asymptotically AdS space by Solodukhin [15]. In the latter case, the\nthroat size could be deduced by going to the boundary of AdS and applying the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence [16, 17]. We were able to find an expression for the throat of the wormhole\nin our case by concentrating on the dynamics near the horizon (throat).\nAlthough we explicitly considered an effective potential arising from a narrow wormhole, our results are independent of the details of the potential. To leading order, the\noscillatory behavior (69) relies solely on the dispersion relation (53) in which the effective\nmass (54) is determined by the minimum of the effective potential. Moreover, the effective length (65) which determines the spatial periodicity of Green functions and enters the\nnormalized average (71) is also generically given to leading order by Leff \u223c ln \u03bb1 , therefore\nthe expression (73) for the Poincar\u00e9 time holds more generally. These observations support\nthe argument that by modifying the effective potential we have correctly accounted for\nquantum effects to leading order.\n\n10\n\n\fIt would be interesting to generalize the discussion to higher-dimensions. We should\nobtain qualitatively similar results because the potential near the horizon retains the same\nform [21]. By concentrating on the dynamics near the horizon, we may thus arrive at\na quantitative understanding of Poincar\u00e9 recurrences in an asymptotically flat black hole\nbackground.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
