Note that the previous conditions imply that \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b7 since if a level un is simultaneously\nnormalized for upcrossings and for exceedances we necessarily have \u03bd \u2264 \u03c4 .\n\nThe conditional cluster size distribution \u03c0\nen defined in (1.3) is also related to the upcrossings index \u03b7\n\nin the following interesting manner, which is a direct consequence of Lemma 2.1 of Ferreira [4].\n\n2\n\n\fProposition 1.1 Suppose X satisfies \u2206(u(\u03bd) ), \u03bd > 0, has upcrossings index \u03b7 > 0 and let \u03c0\nen be defined\n(\u03bd)\n\nas in (1.3) with un = un .

Hence, it is natural to estimate \u03b7 as the reciprocal of the sample average cluster size.\nHowever, such an estimator suffers from the drawback that the identification of clusters (equivalently,\nchoice of kn ) depends on the knowledge of the mixing coefficients \u03b1n,ln . Alternative ways of identifying\nclusters of high level upcrossings is therefore a key issue for the estimation of \u03b7.\nIf a sequence is suitably well-behaved then one might hope that groups of successive upcrossings of\nun are sufficiently far apart that each group can be regarded as a separate cluster.

It roughly states that whenever an upcrossing of a high level occurs, a cluster of upcrossings\nmay follow it, but once the sequence falls below the threshold it is very unlikely to upcross it again in\nthe nearby observations. Thus, it enables the identification of upcrossings clusters since for this class\n3\n\n\fupcrossings may be simply identified asymptotically as runs of consecutive upcrossings and the cluster\nsizes as run lengths. Indeed, Ferreira [5] proved that if the conditional upcrossing run length distribution\nis defined as\ne2j+3,2j+3 = 0 | N\ne1,1 = 0, X3 \u2264 un < X4 ), j \u2265 1,\n\u03c0\nen\u2217 (j) = P (X3 \u2264 un < X4 , . . . , X2j+1 \u2264 un < X2j+2 , N\n\n(1.7)\n\nthen the following result gives the conditional expected length of an upcrossing run.\n\ne (3) (u(\u03bd) ) and P (X3 \u2264 u(\u03bd)\nProposition 1.2 (Ferreira [5]) If, for each \u03bd > 0, X satisfies condition D\nn <\n(\u03bd)\n\nX4 , . . . , X2j\u22121 \u2264 un < X2j ) \u2212\u2192 0, as j \u2192 +\u221e, then the upcrossings index of X exists and is equal to \u03b7\nif and only if,\n\nX\n\n(\u03bd)\n\nje\n\u03c0n\u2217 (j)\n\nj\u22651\n\nfor each \u03bd > 0.\n\nP (X1 \u2264 un < X2 )\n1\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 ,\n(\u03bd)\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\u03b7\ne3,3 = 0)\nP (X1 \u2264 un < X2 , N\n\n(1.8)\n\nFrom this result it seems natural to estimate \u03b7 by the reciprocal of the sample average run length.\nWe shall consider such an estimator in Section 3.\ne (3) (u) the upcrossings index can be related to other dependence measures,\nRemark 4 Under condition D\n\nnamely the lag-1 upcrossings tail dependence coefficient \u03bc1 , since \u03b7 = 1 \u2212 \u03bc1 = 1 \u2212 limx\u2192xF P (X3 \u2264\n(\u03bd)\n\n(\u03bd)\n\nun < X4 | X1 \u2264 un < X2 ), where xF is the upper limit of the common marginal distribution F of X,\nas shown in Ferreira and Ferreira [6].\n\nAlternative expressions for \u03b7 involving only stationarity are given in the following simple lemma.\ne3,3 = 0) \u2212\nLemma 1.1 If nP (X1 \u2264 un < X2 , N\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 \u03be > 0 then the following are equivalent:\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\ne3,3 = 0 | X1 \u2264 un < X2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b7;\ni) P (N\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nii) nP (X1 \u2264 un < X2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u03be ;\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\ne1,1 = 0, N\ne3,3 = 0)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\niii) n(1 \u2212 P (N\n\u2192 \u03be + \u03b7\u03be .\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\ne3,3 = 0) = P (N\ne1,1 =\nRemark 5 From the stationarity of X we obviously have P (X1 \u2264 un < X2 , N\n0, X3 \u2264 un < X4 ) and consequently an upcrossings run can be either identified at its beginning or at its\n\nend.\n\nThe upcrossings index estimation is important not only by itself, as a measure of clustering of upcrossings of high levels, but also because of its relation with other dependence coefficients, namely the\nextremal index and the lag-1 upcrossings tail coefficient (Ferreira and Ferreira [6]). Therefore, we shall\npursuit this issue in the remainder of this paper. Note that under the conditions of Proposition 1.2 it is\nreasonable to estimate \u03b7 by the ratio between the number of upcrossings followed by a non-upcrossing\nand the number of upcrossings of a high level.\nIn Section 2, we formally present such an estimator, suggested in Ferreira [5], which we shall call\nthe runs estimator of the upcrossings. In the subsequent sections we show that such an estimator is\n4\n\n\ftypically weakly consistent and asymptotically normal. In Section 6 we carry out a simulation study of\nfinite sample behaviour of the proposed estimator in a max-autoregressive process and in a first order\nautoregressive process. In Section 7 the performance of the estimator is also assessed through case studies\nin the fields of environment and finance. Conclusions are found in Section 8.\n\n2\n\nThe runs estimator of the upcrossings index\nBefore formally defining the runs estimator of the upcrossings index, we shall start by introducing\n\nsome notation that will be used throughout the paper.\nbn denote the point process of non-upcrossings of un , followed by an upcrossing, by the first n\nLet N\n\nvariables of X, that is\n\nbn (B) =\nN\n\nn\u22123\nX\ni=1\n\n1I{Nei,i =0,\n\nXi+2 \u2264un <Xi+3 }\n\nB \u2282 [0, 1], n \u2265 1.\n\n\u03b4 i (B),\nn\n\n(2.1)\n\nFor a sequence of real levels {un }n\u22651 lets define the random variables Yi \u2261 Yi (un ), i = 1, . . . , n,\n\ncorresponding to the number of consecutive upcrossings of the level un occurring from instant i + 2 on,\nthat is,\n(\nYi =\n\nei+2,i+2 = 0\n0 if N\n\nei+2k+2,i+2k+2 = 0,\nk if Xi+2 \u2264 un < Xi+3 , Xi+4 \u2264 un < Xi+5 , . . . , Xi+2k \u2264 un < Xi+2k+1 , N\n\nwith k \u2265 1.

Thus, the precise choice of vn depends\non the knowledge of the joint distribution of (X1 , X2 ), typically unknown. These deterministic levels will\nhave to be replaced, in practical situations, by random levels suggested by the relation\nn\nP (X1 \u2264 vn < X2 ) \u223c \u03bd.\ncn\n\n11\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fThis relation basically states that the expected number of upcrossings of the level vn is approximately cn \u03bd.\nContrarily to the random levels used in the estimation of the extremal index, these random levels can not\nbe represented by an appropriate order statistic. Nevertheless, for levels vn such that\n\nn\ncn P (X1\n\n> vn ) \u223c \u03c4\n\nthe expected number of upcrossings will be necessarily smaller or equal to cn \u03c4. It then seems natural\nto also replace vn by the appropriate order statistic used in the estimation of the extremal index (for\nexample, Nandagopalan [15]), namely vbn = Xn\u2212[cn \u03c4 ]:n .

Note that this implies that for a sample (X1 , . . . , Xn ) of\n(6.1) with n sufficiently large, the number of upcrossings of a high level is approximately 2/3 of the\nnumber of exceedances of the same level.\nWe shall consider in the following simulations the level u = Xn\u2212k:n , in (2.3) corresponding to the\n(k + 1)th top order statistics associated to the random sample (X1 , . . . , Xn ) of (6.1), commonly used in\nthe estimation of the extremal index (see, for example, Nandagopalan [15] and Gomes, et al.

Hence,\nthe upcrossings index estimator is now a function of k, \u03b7bn (k).\n13\n\n\fFigure 2: Sample path of the upcrossings index estimator as a function of k for a sample of size n = 5000\nfrom the stationary ARMAX process in (6.1), in a linear scale (left) and in a logarithmic scale (right).\n\nIn Figure 2 we present a sample path of the estimator \u03b7bn in (2.3) as a function of k \u2265 1, for a sample\n\nof size n = 5000 in a linear scale and in a logarithmic scale.\n\nAs we can see from Figure 2 the logarithmic scale enhances the performance of \u03b7bn for small values of\n\nk, giving better insight of its stability region around \u03b7 = 0.5.\n\nFor samples of size n = 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10000, from the ARMAX process in (6.1),\nwe have performed a multi-sample Monte Carlo simulation with 5000 runs and 10 replicates. For details\non multi-sample simulation see, for instance, Gomes and Oliveira [8]. We have simulated for the estimator\n\u03b7bn (k) in (2.3), the mean value (E), the mean squared error (M SE) and the optimal sample fraction k0\nwith k0 := arg mink M SE[b\n\u03b7n (k)].\n\nIn Figure 3, we illustrate the values of the estimated mean values and MSE's of \u03b7bn (k) in (2.3), for\n\na sample of size n = 5000 from the ARMAX process in (6.1), with upcrossings index \u03b7 = 0.5.

[2],\n1\nXn = \u2212 Xn\u22121 + \u01ebn ,\nr\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere {\u01ebn }n\u22651 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, such that, for\n\na fixed integer r \u2265 2, \u01ebn \u223c U { 1r , . . . , r\u22121\nr , 1} and X0 \u223c U (0, 1) independent of \u01ebn .\n(3)\ne\nCondition D (u) also holds for this stationary sequence, with u = u(\u03bd) = {un = 1 \u2212 \u03c4 /n}n\u22651 , \u03c4 > 0,\nmoreover limn\u2192+\u221e nP (X1 > un ) = \u03c4 and \u03b7 = \u03b8 = 1 \u2212 1/r 2 (see Sebasti\u00e3o et al. [18]). Condition\n\nD \u2032\u2032 (u) typically doesn't hold for these sequences since they tend to oscillate rapidly near extremes. To\nillustrate this characteristic we present in Figure 4 sample paths of the negatively correlated uniform\nAR(1) processes for r = 2, r = 3 and r = 5 (\u03b7 = \u03b8 = 0.75, \u03b7 = \u03b8 = 0.89 and \u03b7 = \u03b8 = 0.96, respectively).\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0.8\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b7 = 0.96\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b7 = 0.89\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b7 = 0.75\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFigure 4: Sample paths of the stationary AR(1) process in (6.2), with r = 2 (left), r = 3 (center) and\nr = 5 (right)\n\nWe present, in Figures 5-7, the estimated mean values and MSE's of \u03b7bn (k) in (2.3), for a sample of size\n\nn = 5000 from the AR(1) process in (6.2), with upcrossings index \u03b7 = 0.75, 0.89 and 0.96, respectively.\n\nIn Table 2 we present the main distributional properties of the estimator under study with the\nassociated 95% confidence intervals.\n\n6.3\n\nSome overall conclusions\n\n\u2022 The sample paths of the runs estimator of the upcrossings index have very different patterns for\n\nthe ARMAX and the AR(1) process. Whilst for the ARMAX process the estimates increase with\n15\n\n\fr=2\n\nr=3\n\nr=5\n\nFigure 5: Estimated mean values (left) and mean squared errors (right), for samples of size n = 5000 from\nthe AR(1) process in (6.2) with, respectively, r = 2 (\u03b7 = 0.75), r = 3 (\u03b7 = 0.89) and r = 5 (\u03b7 = 0.96)\n\nthe value of k, for the AR(1) process the estimates, as function of k, have almost a symmetric\ndistribution, decreasing with smaller values of k.\n\u2022 For the ARMAX process, smaller values of \u03b7 tend to be associated with a wider \"bathtub\" pattern\nof the mean squared error as a function of k.\n\n\u2022 The runs estimator of the upcrossings index has some mean value stability around the target \u03b7 for\nsmall values of k, exhibiting, for such values, the mean squared error a \"bathtub\" pattern, although\nnot very wide.\n\u2022 For small values of k, or equivalently high levels, we obtain good estimates for \u03b7.

This is clear form Figure 6 where we can see that for the ARMAX\nprocess the behaviour of the mean squared error is almost determined by the bias (overlap of both\ncurves), since the variance is always very small. The same behaviour holds for the AR(1) process.\n\nFigure 6: Estimated mean squared error (solid line), estimated variance (dashed line) and estimated bias\n(dotted line), for samples of size n = 5000 from the ARMAX process in (6.1).\n\n17\n\n\f7\n\nCase-studies\n\n7.1\n\nOzone pollution\n\nWe now consider the performance of the above mentioned estimator in the analysis of n = 120 weekly\nmaxima of hourly averages of ozone concentrations measured in parts per million, in the San Francisco\nbay area, San Jos\u00e9. These data are available in the package Xtremes (Reiss and Thomas [16]) and have\nalready been studied, for instance, in Gomes et al. [7] when estimating the extremal index. In Figure 7\n\n10\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nxt\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nwe picture the data over the above mentioned period.\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nt\n\nFigure 7: Weekly maxima of hourly averages of ozone concentrations measured in parts per million, in\nthe San Francisco bay area, San Jos\u00e9\n\ne (3) is not yet possible to verify we assumed that it holds since as stated\nSince in practice condition D\n\nGomes et al. [7], most of the parametric models that adequately fit this type of meteorological data\ne (3) .\nsatisfy condition D \u2032\u2032 and therefore also satisfy condition D\nIn Figure 8 we picture the sample paths of \u03b7bn (k) as functions of k in a linear scale (left) and logarithmic\n\n(right) scale.\n\nFigure 8: Estimates of the upcrossings index as a function of k for the weekly maxima of hourly averages\nof ozone concentrations measured in parts per million, in the San Francisco bay area, San Jos\u00e9, in a linear\nscale (left) and in a logarithmic scale (right).\n\n18\n\n\fThe stability around one for small values of k agrees with the fact that \u03b7 = 1 since from [7] condition\nD \u2032\u2032\n\nholds. Nevertheless, the small number of observations makes it difficult to rely on such a point\n\nestimate since the number of upcrossings and consequently the number of non-upcrossings followed by\nan upcrossing, of a hight level, will always be very small.\n\n7.2\n\nFinancial log-returns\n\nFinancial time series are very unlikely to satisfy condition D \u2032\u2032 because of their varying volatility.\nTherefore, we shall consider now the time series of log returns of the German stock market index DAX,\nconsisting of the 30 major German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The daily\nclosing prices of the DAX index for the period from 1991 to 1998 that we work with is available as\ndataset EuStockMarkets in the statistics software R, which we also used for all computations. This data\nset of 1786 observations has been considered in Klar at al. [10] where we can find a full statistical\ndescription. In Figure 9 we picture DAX daily closing prices over the mentioned period, xt , and the\nlog-returns, 100 \u00d7 (ln xt \u2212 ln xt\u22121 ), the data to be analyzed.\n\nFigure 9: DAX daily closing prices (left) and daily log-returns (right)\n\nThis time series of log returns is well modeled by a GARCH(1,1), covariance stationary, process\n([10]). Using a goodness-of-fit test Klar at al. [10], at a 5% level, do not reject the hypothesis that the\ninnovations of the process follow a t-distribution with seven degrees of freedom.\n\nFigure 10: Estimates of the upcrossings index as a function of k for the DAX log-returns\n\nThe graph in Figure 10 allows us to conclude that \u03b7 is not equal to one, which agrees with the fact\nthat these processes are very unlikely to verify condition D \u2032\u2032 . The sample path exhibits a stability region\n19\n\n\faround a value close to \u03b7 = 0.8.\nMikosch and St\u0103ric\u0103 [14] derive the extremal index for the squared GARCH(1,1) processes, whereas\nLaurini and Tawn [11] propose an algorithm for the evaluation of the extremal index of GARCH(1,1)\nprocesses with t\u2212distributed innovations. It would be interesting, in future work, to obtain similar results\nfor the upcrossings index of a GARCH(1,1) process.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nThe upcrossings index, as a measure of the clustering of upcrossings of high levels, is an important\ne (3) , that locally restricts\nparameter when studying extreme events. For sequences satisfying condition D\n\nthe dependence of the sequence but still allows clustering of upcrossings, we have proposed a simple\nestimator for this parameter. The study of the properties of the proposed estimator, namely its consistency and asymptotic normality, has been carried out in Sections 3 and 4. With simulations of well\ne (3) we were able to illustrate the performance of\nknown autoregressive processes that verify condition D\nthe estimator. Case studies in the fields of environment and finance were also exploited.\n\nRelation (1.5) allows one also to estimate \u03b7 through the extremal index \u03b8 modified by consistent\n\nestimators of exceedances, \u03c4 , and the mean number of upcrossings, \u03bd, of high levels. Several estimators\nfor the extremal index can be found in the literature (see Ancona-Navarrete and Tawn [1] for a survey).\nOther estimators arise from Proposition 1.1 and from the relation with \u03bc1 , the upcrossings-tail dependence\ncoefficient. In future work we intend to propose new estimators for the upcrossings index and compare\nthe several estimating methods.\n\nReferences\n[1] Ancona-Navarrete, M. A. and Tawn, J. A. (2000).
