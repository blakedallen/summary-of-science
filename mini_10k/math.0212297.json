The vanishing\nof the Kirby-Siebenmann class KS(M ) in H 4 (M ; Z/2) is both necessary and\nsufficient for the existence of a combinatorial triangulation of M n for n \u2265 5\nby [7]. A combinatorial triangulation of a closed manifold M n is a simplicial\ntriangulation for which the link of every i-simplex is a combinatorial sphere of\ndimension n \u2212 i \u2212 1. Galewski and Stern [3, Theorem 5] and Matumoto [8]\nindependently proved that a closed connected topological manifold M n with\nn \u2265 5 is simplicially triangulable if and only if\n(1.1)\n\n\u03b4\u03b1 KS(M ) = 0\n\nin H 5 (M ; ker \u03b1)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b1 denotes the Bockstein operator associated to the exact sequence\n\u03b1\n0 \u2192 ker \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b83 \u2212\u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0 of abelian groups. Moreover, the Triangulation\nConjecture is true if and only if this exact sequence splits by [3] or [11, page\n26]. The Rochlin invariant morphism \u03b1 is defined on the homology bordism\ngroup \u03b83 of oriented homology 3-spheres modulo those which bound acyclic\ncompact P L 4-manifolds. Fintushel and Stern [1] and Furuta [2] proved that\n\u03b83 is infinitely generated.\nWe freely employ the notation and information given in Ranicki's excellent exposition [11]. The relative boundary version of the Galewski-Matumoto-Stern\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\fDuane Randall\n\n1148\n\nobstruction theory in [11] produces the following result. Given any homeomorphism f : |K| \u2192 |L| of the polyhedra of closed m-dimensional P L manifolds K and L with m \u2265 5, f is homotopic to a P L homeomorphism if\nand only if KS(f ) vanishes in H 3 (L; Z/2). More generally, a homeomorphism\nf : |K| \u2192 |L| is homotopic to a P L map F : K \u2192 L with acyclic point inverses\nif and only if\n(1.2)\n\n\u03b4\u03b1 (KS(f )) = 0\n\nin H 4 (L; ker \u03b1) .\n\nConcordance classes of simplicial triangulations on M n for n \u2265 5 correspond\nbijectively to vertical homotopy classes of liftings of the stable topological tangent bundle \u03c4 : M \u2192 BTOP to BH by [3, Theorem 1] and so are enumerated\nby H 4 (M ; ker \u03b1). The classifying space BH for the stable bundle theory associated to combinatorial homology manifolds in [11] is denoted by BTRI in\n[3] and by BHML in [8]. We employ obstruction theory to derive some known\nand new results and generalizations of [4] and [13] on the existence of simplicial\ntriangulations in section 2 and to record some equivalent formulations of T C\nin section 3. Although some of these formulations may be known, they do not\nseem to be documented in the literature.\n\n2\n\nSimplicial Triangulations\n\nLet \u03b4\u2217 denote the integral Bockstein operator associated to the exact sequence\n\u03c1\n\u00d72\n0 \u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0. We proceed to derive some consequences of\nthe vanishing of \u03b4\u2217 on Kirby-Siebenmann classes. The coefficient group for\ncohomology is understood to be Z/2 whenever omitted. Matumoto knew in [8]\nthat the vanishing of \u03b4\u2217 KS(M ) implied the vanishing of \u03b4\u03b1 KS(M ). Let \u03b9m\ndenote the fundamental class of the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z, m). Since\nH m+1 (K(Z, m); G) = 0 for all coefficient groups G, trivially \u03b4\u03b1 (\u03c1\u03b9m ) = 0 in\nH m+1 (K(Z, m); ker \u03b1). Thus \u03b4\u03b1 vanishes on KS(M ) in (1.1) or KS(f ) in (1.2)\nwhenever \u03b4\u2217 does. This observation together with (1.1) and (1.2) justifies the\nfollowing well-known statements. Every closed connected topological manifold\nM n with n \u2265 5 and \u03b4\u2217 KS(M ) = 0 admits a simplicial triangulation. Let\nf : |K| \u2192 |L| be any homeomorphism of the polyhedra of closed m-dimensional\nP L manifolds K and L with m \u2265 5. If \u03b4\u2217 KS(f ) = 0, then f is homotopic to\na P L map F : K \u2192 L with acyclic point inverses.\nProposition 2.1 All k -fold Cartesian products of closed 4-manifolds are simplicially triangulable for k \u2265 2. All products M 4 \u00d7S 1 with non-orientable closed\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fEquivalences to the triangulation conjecture\n\n1149\n\n4-manifolds M 4 are simplicially triangulable. Let N 4 be any simply connected\nclosed 4-manifold with KS(N ) trivial and also b = rank of H2 (N ; Z) \u2265 1. Let\nf : |K| \u2192 |L| be any homeomorphism with KS(f ) nontrivial and |K| = |L| =\nN \u00d7 S 1 . Then f is homotopic to a P L map F : K \u2192 L with acyclic point\ninverses.\nProof of 2.1 Since KS(\u03b3) is a primitive cohomology class for the universal\nbundle \u03b3 on BTOP, we have KS(M1 \u00d7 M2 ) = KS(M1 ) \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 KS(M2 ) in\nH 4 (M1 \u00d7 M2 ). Triviality of \u03b4\u03b1 on H 4 (M 4 ) by dimensionality yields triangulability of all k -fold products of closed 4-manifolds for k \u2265 2, and of M 4 \u00d7 S 1\nby (1.1).\nThe product N 4 \u00d7 S 1 admits 2b distinct combinatorial structures by [7]; moreover, for every non-zero class u in H 3 (N \u00d7 S 1 ), there is a homeomorphism of\npolyhedra with distinct combinatorial structures whose Casson-Sullivan invariant is u by [11, page 15]. The vanishing of \u03b4\u2217 KS(f ) follows from the triviality\nof \u03b4\u2217 on H 3 (N \u00d7 S 1 ) = \u03c1(H 2 (N ; Z) \u2297 H 1 (S 1 ; Z)).\nNo closed 4-manifold M 4 with KS(M ) non-zero can be simplicially triangulated. Yet k -fold products of such manifolds M 4 by (2.1) and their products\nwith spheres or tori produce infinitely many distinct non-combinatorial, yet\nsimplicially triangulable closed manifolds in every dimension \u2265 5. In contrast,\nthere are no known examples of non-smoothable closed 4-manifolds which can\nbe simplicially triangulated, according to Problem 4.72 of [6, page 287].\nTheorem 2.2 Let M n be any closed connected topological manifold with\nn \u2265 5 such that the stable spherical fibration determined by the tangent bundle\n\u03c4 (M ) has odd order in [M, BSG]. Suppose that either H2 (M ; Z) has no 2torsion or else all 2-torsion in H4 (M ; Z) has order 2. Then M is simplicially\ntriangulable.\nProof The Stiefel-Whitney classes of M are trivial by the hypothesis of odd\norder. We first consider the special case that \u03c4 (M ) is stably fiber homotopically\ntrivial. Let g : M \u2192 SG/STOP be any lifting of a classifying map \u03c4 (M ) : M \u2192\nBSTOP in the fibration\n(2.3)\n\nj\n\n\u03c0\n\nSG/STOP \u2212\u2192 BSTOP \u2212\u2192 BSG\n\nThe Postnikov 4-stage of SG/STOP is K(Z/2, 2) \u00d7 K(Z, 4). Now j \u2217 KS(\u03b3e ) =\n\u03b922 + \u03c1(\u03b94 ) by Theorem 15.1 of [7, page 328] where \u03b3e denotes the universal\nbundle over BSTOP. Clearly \u03b4\u2217 (j \u2217 KS(\u03b3e )) = \u03b4\u2217 (\u03b922 ) = 2u where u generates\nH 5 (K(Z/2, 2); Z) \u2248 Z/4. If all nonzero 2-torsion in H4 (M ; Z) has order 2,\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fDuane Randall\n\n1150\n\nthen \u03b4\u2217 KS(M ) = 2g\u2217 u = 0. If H2 (M ; Z) has no 2-torsion, then \u03b4\u2217 (g \u2217 \u03b92 ) = 0\nso again \u03b4\u2217 KS(M ) = 0. Thus \u03b4\u03b1 KS(M ) = 0.\nWe suppose now that the stable spherical fibration of \u03c4 (M ) has order 2a + 1\nin [M, BSG] with a \u2265 1. Let s : M \u2192 S(2a\u03c4 (M )) be a section to the sphere\nbundle projection p : S(2a\u03c4 (M )) \u2192 M associated to 2a\u03c4 (M ). Now S(2a\u03c4 (M ))\nis a stably fiber homotopically trivial manifold, since its stable tangent bundle\nis (2a + 1)p\u2217 \u03c4 (M ). Since KS(M ) = (2a + 1)KS(M ) = s\u2217 (KS(S(2a\u03c4 (M ))))\nwe conclude that\n\u03b4\u2217 KS(M ) = s\u2217 (\u03b4\u2217 KS(S(2a\u03c4 (M )))) = s\u2217 0 = 0 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe consider the following homotopy commutative diagram of principal fibrations.\ni\nK(ker \u03b1, 4) \u2212\u2192 (K(ker \u03b1, 4), \u2217)\n= (K(ker \u03b1, 4), \u2217)\n\n(2.5)\nS4\n\nks\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\ni\n\nBH\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nBT OP\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c0\ny\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyi\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\ni\n\n(BH, BP L)\n\nt\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(K(\u03b83 , 4), \u2217)\n\n(BT OP, BP L) \u2212\u2192\n\nc\nKS\n\n(K(Z/2, 4), \u2217)\n\n(K(ker \u03b1, 5), \u2217)\n\n(K(ker \u03b1, 5), \u2217)\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\u03c0\u0302\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nc\ny\u03b4\u03b1 KS\n\n=\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03b1\ny\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b9\n\nThe fiber map \u03b1 is induced from the path-loop fibration on K(ker \u03b1, 5) via the\nBockstein operator \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b9 on the fundamental class \u03b9 of K(Z/2, 4).

That is, [ks] has order 2 and is dual to KS(\u03b3) under the mod 2\nHurewicz morphism. Now ks admits an extension f : S 4 \u222a2 e5 \u2192 BTOP, since\nthe cofibration exact sequence\n(3.2)\n\n\u00d72\n\n\u03c05 (BTOP) \u2212\u2192 [S4 \u222a2 e5 , BTOP] \u2192 \u03c04 (BTOP) \u2212\u2192 \u03c04 (BTOP)\n\u00d72\n\ncorresponds to 0 \u2212\u2192 Z/2 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2295 Z/2 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2295 Z/2.

Thus T C is true. Conversely, if T C is\n[KS\ntrue, a section s : BTOP \u2192 BH to \u03c0 in (2.5) gives a lifting s \u25e6 f of f .\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fDuane Randall\n\n1152\n\nT C \u21d4 (3) Properties of KS(\u03b3) are enumerated in [9] and [10]. Since\nSq 1 KS(\u03b3) 6= 0, a section s to \u03c0 in (2.5) gives Sq 1 (KS(\u03b3\u0302) 6= 0 so T C implies 3. We now assume that T C is false and claim that the generator Sq 1 \u03b9 for\nH 5 (K(Z/2, 4)) \u2248 Z/2 lies in the image of\nH 5 (K(ker \u03b1, 5)) \u2248 Hom(\u03c05 (K(ker\u03b1 , 5)), Z/2) \u2248 Hom(ker \u03b1, Z/2).\nThe Serre exact sequence then gives \u03b1\u2217 (Sq 1 \u03b9) = 0 in H 5 (K(\u03b83 , 4)) so\nSq 1 KS(\u03b3\u0302) = (t \u25e6 i)\u2217 (\u03b1\u2217 Sq 1 \u03b9) = 0.\nThus we must construct a morphism ker \u03b1 \u2192 Z/2 which does not extend to\n\u03c1\n\u00d72\n\u03b83 . We consider the sequence ker \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 ker \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 ker \u03b1 \u2297 Z/2 and define\nh : ker \u03b1 \u2297 Z/2 \u2192 Z/2 as follows. h(v) = 1 if and only if v = \u03c1(2z) for some\nz \u2208 \u03b83 with \u03b1(z) = 1. Now h is a well-defined and non-trivial morphism, since\n\u03b83 does not have an element u with 2u = 0 and \u03b1(u) = 1 by hypothesis. The\ncomposite morphism h \u25e6 \u03c1 : ker \u03b1 \u2192 Z/2 does not extend to \u03b83 .\nT C \u21d4 (4) Suppose M n with Sq 1 KS(M ) 6= 0 admits a simplicial triangulation. Now Sq 1 KS(M ) = g\u2217 Sq 1 KS(\u03b3\u0302) for any lifting g : M \u2192 BH of\n\u03c4 : M \u2192 BTOP. Since Sq 1 KS(\u03b3\u0302) 6= 0, T C holds by (3).\nd in (2.5) gives \u03b4\u03b1 KS(f ) = 0 via naturality\nT C \u21d4 (5) Clearly triviality of \u03b4\u03b1 KS\nfor every f . Suppose that \u03b4\u03b1 KS(f ) = 0 for any such f in 5. Now KS(f ) =\n\u03c1(v) \u2297 i\u2217 a in \u03c1(H 2 (M ; Z)) \u2297 H 1 (RP 2 ) \u2248 H 3 (L). Here a generates H \u2217 (RP \u221e )\nand i : RP 2 \u2282 RP \u221e . Naturality via the universal example CP \u221e \u00d7 RP \u221e\nfor \u03c1(v) \u2297 i\u2217 a gives \u03b4\u03b1 KS(f ) = v \u2297 \u03b4\u03b1 (i\u2217 a). Since i\u2217 : H 2 (RP \u221e ; ker \u03b1) \u2192\nH 2 (RP 2 ; ker \u03b1) is a monomorphism, \u03b4\u03b1 (i\u2217 a) = 0 if and only if \u03b4\u03b1 (a) = 0. Now\n\u03b4\u03b1 (a) = 0 if and only if T C is true via the fibration\n\u03b1\n\nK(ker \u03b1, 1) \u2212\u2192 K(\u03b83 , 1) \u2212\u2192 RP \u221e .\nT C \u21d4 (6) \u21d4 (7) T C holds if and only if \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b9 = 0 for the fundamental class\n\u03b9 of K(Z/2, 3). Concordance classes of simplicial triangulations of M n arising\nfrom combinatorial triangulations differ by classes in \u03b4\u03b1 H 3 (M ). This subgroup\nof H 4 (M, ker \u03b1) is trivial by naturality if \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b9 = 0. Conversely, \u03b4\u03b1 H 3 (RP 5 ) = 0\nif the two distinct combinatorial triangulations of RP 5 given by Theorem 16.5\nin [7, pages 332 and 337] are simplicially concordant. But \u03b4\u03b1 (a3 ) = 0 if and\nonly if \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b9 = 0 via the skeletal inclusion RP35 \u2282 K(Z/2, 3) and naturality for\nRP 5 \u2192 RP35 .\nT C \u21d4 (8) Similar to Theorem 5.1 of [12], we consider a regular neighborhood\nof the 9-skeleton of SG/STOP embedded in Rm for some m \u2265 19 in order\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fEquivalences to the triangulation conjecture\n\n1153\n\nto obtain a smoothly parallelizable manifold W with boundary and a map\ng : W \u2192 SG/STOP which is a homotopy equivalence through dimension 7.\nThe double DW is smoothly parallelizable and admits an extension gb : DW \u2192\nSG/STOP. Note that (gb)\u2217 is a monomorphism through dimension 7. Let h :\nM \u2192 DW be a degree one normal map. Now M is stably fiber homotopically\ntrivial and h\u2217 is a monomorphism in cohomology. In particular, (gb \u25e6 h)\u2217 is\na monomorphism on H 5 (SG/STOP; ker \u03b1). We conclude that \u03b4\u03b1 KS(M ) =\n(gb \u25e6 h)\u2217 (\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b922 ) = 0 if and only if \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b922 = 0 for the fundamental class \u03b92 of\nK(Z/2, 2).
