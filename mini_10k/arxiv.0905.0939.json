This\nproves a conjecture of Tian for the smooth solutions of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe limiting behavior of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow is deeply related to the existence of canonical\nmetrics and the minimal model program in algebraic geometry. Let X be an n-dimensional\ncompact K\u00e4hler manifold. We consider the following unnormalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\nstarting with a K\u00e4hler metric \u03c90 .\n\uf8f1\n\u2202\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c9 = \u2212Ric(\u03c9)\n\u2202t\n(1.1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c9|t=0 = \u03c90 .\nIf c1 (X) = 0, the unnormalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) converges to the unique Ricciflat metric in [\u03c90 ] [Cao], [Y1]. If c1 (X) < 0, the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\n\u2202\n\u03c9 = \u2212Ric(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c9\n\u2202t\n\n(1.2)\n\nconverges to the unique hyperbolic K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric [Cao], [Y1], [A].\nIf c1 (X) is nonpositive and not strictly negative, there does not exist a smooth K\u00e4hlerEinstein metric on X. However, the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.2) has long time\nexistence. If X is a minimal model of general type, the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.2) converges\nto the unique singular K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric as time tends to infinity [Ts], [TZha]. In\ngeneral, if the canonical bundle KX is semi-ample, the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.2)\ncan possibly collapse but it always converges to the unique generalized K\u00e4hler-Einstein\nmetric on the canonical model of X [SoT1], [SoT2].\nIf c1 (X) > 0, X is called a Fano manifold in algebraic geometry. It is conjectured by\nYau [Y2] that the existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric is equivalent to suitable stability\nin the sense of geometric invariant theory. The condition of K-stability is later proposed\nby Tian [T1] and has been refined by Donaldson [D]. The K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow provides an\napproach to the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture and it has attracted considerable current\n1\n\nResearch supported in part by National Science Foundation grant DMS-06-04805.\n\n1\n\n\finterest. We refer the reader to an incomplete list of literatures [PS1], [PS2], [PSSW1],\n[PSSW2], [Sz], [To] and [CW] for some recent development. If one assumes the existence\nof a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric, then according to the unpublished work of Perelman [P2]\n\u2202\n(see [TZhu]), the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow \u2202t\ng = \u2212Ric(g) + g with the initial K\u00e4hler\nmetric in c1 (X) converges to a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric (this is due to [H], [Ch] in the case\nof one complex dimension).\nLet M be a closed Riemannian manifold and g(t) be a smooth solution of the Ricci\nflow for t \u2208 [0, T ). The Ricci flow becomes extinct at t = T if (M, g(t)) converges to a\npoint in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff, or equivalently, the diameter of g(t) tends to 0 as\nt \u2192 T . It is proved in [IK] that the diameter of g(t) is uniformly bounded below from 0 if\nthere exists an element of infinite order in H1 (M, Z). However, many projective manifolds\ndo not admit elements of infinite order in H1 (M, Z). In particular, Fano manifolds are\nall simply connected. Indeed, it is proved by Perelman [P2] (see [SeT]) that the K\u00e4hlerRicci flow (1.1) on Fano manifolds becomes extinct in finite time if the initial K\u00e4hler\nclass is proportional to the first Chern class of the manifold. Thus it is of our interest\nto completely understand the extinction conditions for the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1). In\ngeneral, the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow can be weakly defined on singular projective varieties with\nmild singularities and surgeries might be performed, as investigated in [SoT3]. Therefore\nthe notion of extinction can be generalized to the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow with surgery. The\nfollowing conjecture is proposed by Tian in [T2].\nConjecture 1.1 The K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) with surgery becomes extinct in finite time\nif and only if the initial projective manifold is birationally equivalent to a Fano manifold.\nIt is shown in [SW] that the conjecture holds in the special case of Hirzebruch surfaces\nwhen the initial K\u00e4hler metric satisfies the Calabi symmetry.\nWe prove Conjecture 1.1 in the case of the usual K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow with smooth solutions.\nTheorem 1.1 Let X be an n-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold. Then the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\n(1.1) with an initial K\u00e4hler metric in the class of H 2 (X, Z) becomes extinct in finite time\nif and only if X is Fano and the initial K\u00e4hler class is proportional to c1 (X).\nMore generally, we have the following general diameter estimates.\nTheorem 1.2 Let X be n-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold. Let \u03c90 be a K\u00e4hler metric on X\nsuch that [\u03c90 ] \u2208 H 2 (X, Z). Then the diameter is uniformly bounded below from 0 along\nthe K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) if one of the following conditions holds.\n1. KX is semi-ample.\n\u22121\n2. KX is not nef and KX\nis not ample.\n\u22121\n\u22121\n3. KX\nis ample and [\u03c90 ] is not proportional to [KX\n].\n\nIn particular, if KX is semi-ample\n\u221a and the Kodaira dimension of X is positive, the\ndiameter tends to infinity of order t as t \u2192 \u221e along the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1).\n2\n\n\fIt is known that the abundance conjecture holds for dimension three and so KX is\nsemi-ample whenever it is nef. The following corollary is then an immediate consequence\nof Theorem 1.2.\nCorollary 1.1 Let X be a K\u00e4hler manifold of dim X \u2264 3. Then the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\n(1.1) on X with an initial K\u00e4hler metric in H 2 (X, Z) becomes extinct if and only if X is\nFano and the initial K\u00e4hler class is proportional to c1 (X).\nThe above statement holds for dim X \u2265 4 if we assume the abundance conjecture.\nWe further propose the following conjecture as a natural attempt to generalize Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.1 by removing the condition for the initial K\u00e4hler class and the\nassumption of the abundance conjecture.\nConjecture 1.2 Let X be an n-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold. Then the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\non X with an initial K\u00e4hler metric becomes extinct if and only if X is Fano and the initial\nK\u00e4hler class is proportional to c1 (X).\nRemark 1.1 Theorem 1.1 also holds if the initial K\u00e4hler metric is in a multiple of a class\nin H 2 (X, Z). This can be easily proved by suitable scaling of the unnormalized flow (1.1).\nIt is pointed out by V. Tosatti to the author that Theorem 1.1 should also be true if the\ninitial K\u00e4hler metric sits in the real N\u00e9ron-Severi group (H 2 (X, Z) \u2229 H 1,1 (X, C)) \u2297 R as\nthe base-point-free theorem holds for R-divisors due to Shokurov.\n\n2\n\nBase point freeness\n\nLet X be an n-dimensional projective manifold and L \u2192 X a holomorphic line bundle\nover X. Let N(L) be the semi-group defined by\nN(L) = {m \u2208 N | H 0 (X, Lm ) 6= 0}.\nGiven any m \u2208 N(L), the linear system |Lm | = PH 0 (X, Lm ) induces a rational map\n\u03a6m : X 99K CPdm\nby any basis {\u03c3m,0 , \u03c3m,1 , ... , \u03c3m,dm } of H 0 (X, Lm ) as\n\u03a6m (z) = [\u03c3m,0 , \u03c3m,1 , ... , \u03c3m,dm ] (z),\nwhere dm + 1 = dim H 0 (X, Lm ). Let Ym = \u03a6m (X) \u2282 CPdm be the closure of the image of\nX by \u03a6m .\nDefinition 2.1 The Iitaka dimension of L is defined to be\n\u03ba(X, L) = max {dim Ym }\nm\u2208N (L)\n\nif N(L) 6= \u03c6, and \u03ba(X, L) = \u2212\u221e if N(L) = \u03c6.\n3\n\n\fDefinition 2.2 Let X be an projective manifold and KX the canonical line bundle over\nX. Then the Kodaira dimension kod(X) of X is defined to be\nkod(X) = \u03ba(X, KX ).\nThe Kodaira dimension is a birational invariant of projective varieties and the Kodaira\ndimension of a singular variety is equal to that of its smooth model.\nDefinition 2.3 Let L \u2192 X be a holomorphic line bundle over a projective manifold X.\nL is called semi-ample if the linear system |Lm | is base point free for some m > 0.\nFor any m \u2208 N such that |Lm | is base point free, the linear system |Lm | induces a\nholomorphic map \u03a6m\n\u03a6m : X \u2192 CPdm\nby any basis of H 0 (X, Lm ). Let Ym = \u03a6m (X) and so\n\n\u03a6m : X \u2192 Ym \u2208 CPdm .\n\nThe following theorem is well-known (see [L], [U]).\n\nTheorem 2.1 Let L \u2192 X be a semi-ample line bundle over an algebraic manifold X.\nThen there is a projective fibration\n\u03c0:X\u2192Y\nsuch that for any sufficiently large integer m with Lm being globally generated,\nYm = Y\n\nand\n\n\u03a6m = \u03c0,\n\nwhere Y is a normal projective variety. Furthermore, there exists an ample line bundle A\non Y such that Lm = \u03c0 \u2217 A.\nIf L is semi-ample, the graded ring R(X, L) = \u2295m\u22650 H 0 (X, Lm ) is finitely generated\nand so R(X, L) = \u2295m\u22650 H 0 (X, Lm ) is the coordinate ring of Y .\nDefinition 2.4 Let L \u2192 X be a semi-ample line bundle over a projective manifold X.\nThen the algebraic fibration \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y as in Theorem 2.1 is called the Iitaka fibration\nassociated to L. It is completely determined by the linear system |Lm | for sufficiently large\nm.\nThe following theorems are known as the rationality theorem and base-point-free theorem in the minimal model program (see [KMM], [KM]).\nTheorem 2.2 Let X be a projective manifold such that KX is not nef.

Let D be a nef divisor such that aD \u2212 KX\nis nef and big for some a > 0. Then D is semi-ample.\nWe now will apply the base-point-free theorem to the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow at the finite\nblow-up time. We consider the unnormalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) with the initial K\u00e4hler\nclass H = [\u03c90 ] \u2208 H 2 (X, Z) \u2229 H 1,1 (X, C). The evolution of the K\u00e4hler class satisfies the\nfollowing ordinary differential equation\n\u2202\n[\u03c9] = [KX ],\n\u2202t\nTherefore, [\u03c9] = [H + tKX ] for t \u2265 0.\n\n[\u03c9]|t=0 = [H].\n\n(2.2)\n\nT = sup{t \u2265 0 | H + tKX is nef }.\n\n(2.3)\n\nLemma 2.1 Let\nThen T \u2208 Q if KX is not nef and T = \u221e if KX is nef.\nProof The lemma is an immediate corollary of the rationality Theorem 2.2.\n\u2737\nThe following theorem is proved in [TZha] for the maximal existence of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci\nflow.\nProposition 2.1 The K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) exists for t \u2208 [0, T ).\nLemma 2.2 Let L = H + T KX . Then L is semi-ample.\nProof Notice that L \u2212 \u01ebKX = H + (T \u2212 \u01eb)KX is ample for sufficiently small \u01eb > 0. The\nlemma follows from the base-point-free theorem 2.3.\n\u2737\n\n3\n\nThe case when KX is not nef and \u03ba(L) = 0\n\nIf KX is not nef, T < \u221e and the unnormalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (1.1) does not have long\ntime existence and it must develop singularities at t = T . In particular, it is shown in\n[Z] that the scalar curvature must blow up at t = T . Let L = H + T KX . Then either\n\u03ba(L) = 0 or \u03ba(L) > 0 as L is semi-ample.\nProposition 3.1 If \u03ba(L) = 0, X is Fano and [H] is proportional to c1 (X).\nProof Since L semi-ample and \u03ba(L) = 0, Lm is trivial for some m and [L] = 0. Hence\nT c1 (X) = \u2212T [KX ] = [H] > 0.\n\u2737\nThe following theorem is proved by Perelman [P2] (see [SeT]).\n5\n\n\fTheorem 3.1 Let X be a Fano manifold of complex dimension n \u2265 2. The unnormalized\nK\u00e4hler-Ricci flow becomes extinct in finite time if the initial K\u00e4hler class is proportional\nto the first Chern class c1 (X).\nMore precisely, Perelman shows that if X is Fano and the initial K\u00e4hler metric lies\nin c1 (X), the diameter of the evolving metrics is uniformly bounded above along the\n\u2202\ng = \u2212Ric(g) + g.

Let E be the set of all the\npoints on X such that f is not isomorphic.
