The\ndata from both runs have been combined coherently to maximise sensitivity. For the first time\npulsars within binary (or multiple) systems have been included in the search by taking into account\nthe signal modulation due to their orbits. Our upper limits are therefore the first measured for\n56 of these pulsars. For the remaining 22, our results improve on previous upper limits by up to\na factor of 10. For example, our tightest upper limit on the gravitational strain is 2.6\u00d710\u221225 for\nPSR J1603\u22127202, and the equatorial ellipticity of PSR J2124\u22123358 is less than 10\u22126 . Furthermore,\nour strain upper limit for the Crab pulsar is only 2.2 times greater than the fiducial spin-down limit.\nPACS numbers: 04.80.Nn, 95.55.Ym, 97.60.Gb, 07.05.Kf\n\nI.\n\nIn general such a precession would modulate the timeof-arrival of the radio pulses. No strong evidence of such\na modulation is seen in any of the pulsars within our\nsearch band, although it might go unnoticed by radio\nastronomers, either because the modulation is small (as\nwould be the case if the precession is occurring about\nan axis close to the pulsar beam axis) or because the\nperiod of the modulation is very long. However, this\nmisalignment and precession will be quickly damped unless sustained by some mechanism (e.g. Ref. [7]), and\neven with such a mechanism calculations give strain amplitudes which would probably be too low compared to\nLIGO sensitivities [7, 8]. For these reasons, and for the\nreason discussed in \u00a7III, we restrict our search to twice\nthe rotation frequency. Of course, it cannot be ruled out\nthat there are in fact other gravitational wave components, perhaps caused either by a stronger than expected\nprecession excitation mechanism or by an event in the\npulsar's recent past that has set it into a precessional\nmotion which has not yet decayed away. A search for\ngravitational waves from the Crab pulsar at frequencies\nother than twice the rotation frequency is currently under\nway and will be presented elsewhere.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis paper details the results of a search for gravitational wave signals from known radio pulsars in data from\nthe third and fourth LIGO and GEO 600 science runs (denoted S3 and S4). These runs were carried out from 31st\nOctober 2003 to 9th January 2004 and 22nd February to\n23rd March, 2005 respectively. We have applied, and extended, the search technique of Dupuis and Woan [1] to\ngenerate upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude from a selection of known radio pulsars, and infer\nupper limits on their equatorial ellipticities. The work is\na natural extension our previous work given in Refs. [2, 3].\nA.\n\nMotivation\n\nTo emit gravitational waves a pulsar must have some\nmass (or mass-current) asymmetry around its rotation\naxis. This can be achieved through several mechanisms\nsuch as elastic deformations of the solid crust or core\nor distortion of the entire star by an extremely strong\nmisaligned magnetic field (see Sec. III of Ref. [4] for a\nrecent review). Such mechanisms generally result in a\ntriaxial neutron star which, in the quadrupole approximation and with rotation and angular momentum axes\naligned, would produce gravitational waves at twice the\nrotation frequency. These waves would have a characteristic strain amplitude at the Earth (assuming optimal\norientation of the rotation axis) of\nh0 =\n\n16\u03c0 2 G \u03b5Izz \u03bd 2\n,\nc4\nr\n\nKnown pulsars provide an enticing target for gravitational wave searches as their positions and frequencies\nare generally well-known through radio or X-ray observations. As a result the signal search covers a much smaller\nparameter space than is necessary when searching for signals from unknown sources, giving a lower significance\nthreshold. In addition, the deterministic nature of the\nwaves allows a building up of the signal-to-noise ratio by\nobserving coherently for a considerable time. The main\ndrawback in a search for gravitational waves from the\nmajority of known pulsars is that the level of emission\nis likely to be lower than can be detected with current\ndetector sensitivities.\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the neutron star's spin frequency, Izz its principal moment of inertia, \u03b5 = (Ixx \u2212Iyy )/Izz its equatorial\nellipticity, and r its distance from Earth [5].\nA rotating neutron star may also emit gravitational\nwaves at frequencies other than 2\u03bd. For instance, if the\nstar is undergoing free precession there will be gravitational wave emission at (or close to) both \u03bd and 2\u03bd [6].\n\nUsing existing radio measurements, and some reasonable assumptions, it is possible to set an upper limit on\nthe gravitational wave amplitude from a pulsar based\npurely on energy conservation arguments. If one assumes\n3\n\n\fwere used in this search: one a frequency domain, frequentist search, and the other a time domain, Bayesian\nsearch which gave a 95% credible amplitude upper limit\nof 1.4\u00d710\u221222, and an ellipticity upper limit of 2.9\u00d710\u22124\nassuming Izz = 1038 kg m2 .\nAnalysis of data from the LIGO S2 science run set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude from 28\nradio pulsars [3]. To do this, new radio timing data were\nobtained to ensure the pulsars' rotational phases could be\npredicted with the necessary accuracy and to check that\nnone of the pulsars had glitched. These data gave strain\nupper limits as low as a few times 10\u221224 , and several ellipticity upper limits less than 10\u22125 . The Crab pulsar\nwas also studied in this run, giving an upper limit a factor of \u223c 30 greater than the spin-down limit considered\nabove. Prior to this article these were the most sensitive\nstudies made. Preliminary results for the same 28 pulsars using S3 data were given in Dupuis (2004) [14], and\nthese are expanded below.\nIn addition to the above, data from the LIGO S2\nrun have been used to perform an all-sky (i.e., nontargeted) search for continuous wave signals from isolated\nsources, and a search for a signal from the neutron star\nwithin the binary system Sco-X1 [4]. An all-sky continuous wave search using the distributed computing project\nEinstein@home2 has also been performed on S3 data [17].\nThese searches use the same search algorithms, are fully\ncoherent and are ongoing using data from more recent\n(and therefore more sensitive) runs. Additional continuous wave searches using incoherent techniques are also\nbeing performed on LIGO data [18, 19].\nUnfortunately the pulsar population is such that most\nhave spin frequencies that fall below the sensitivity band\nof current detectors. In the future, the low-frequency sensitivity of VIRGO [15] and Advanced LIGO [16] should\nallow studies of a significantly larger sample of pulsars.\n\nthat the pulsar is an isolated rigid body and that the\nobserved spin-down of the pulsar is due to the loss of\nrotational kinetic energy as gravitational radiation (i.e.,\ndErot /dt = 4\u03c0 2 Izz \u03bd \u03bd\u0307) then the gravitational wave amplitude at the Earth (assuming optimal orientation of the\nrotation axis) would be\nhsd =\n\n\u0012\n\n5 GIzz |\u03bd\u0307|\n2 c3 r 2 \u03bd\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(1.2)\n\nOf course these assumptions may not hold, but it would\nbe surprising if neutron stars radiated significantly more\ngravitational energy than this. With these uncertainties\nin mind, searches such as the one described in this paper\nplace direct upper limits on gravitational wave emission\nfrom rotating neutron stars, and these limits are already\napproaching the regime of astrophysical interest.\n\nB.\n\nPrevious results\n\nBefore the advent of large-scale interferometric detectors, there was only a limited ability to search for gravitational waves from known pulsars. Resonant mass gravitational wave detectors are only sensitive in a relatively\nnarrow band around their resonant frequency and so cannot be used to target objects radiating outside that band.\nA specific attempt to search for gravitational waves from\nthe Crab pulsar at a frequency of \u223c 60 Hz was, however,\nmade with a specially designed aluminium quadrupole\nantenna [9, 10] giving a 1\u03c3 upper limit of h0 \u2264 2\u00d710\u221222.\nA search for gravitational waves from what was then\nthe fastest millisecond pulsar, PSR J1939+2134, was conducted by Hough et al [11] using a split bar detector,\nproducing an upper limit of h0 < 10\u221220 .\nThe first pulsar search using interferometer data was\ncarried out with the prototype 40 m interferometer at\nCaltech by Hereld [12]. The search was again for gravitational waves from PSR J1939+2134, and produced upper\nlimits of h0 < 3.1\u00d710\u221217 and h0 < 1.5\u00d710\u221217 for the first\nand second harmonics of the pulsar's rotation frequency.\nA much larger sample of pulsars is accessible to broadband interferometers. As of the beginning of 2005 the\nAustralia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) online pulsar catalogue [13] listed1 154 millisecond and young pulsars, all with rotation frequencies > 25 Hz (gravitational\nwave frequency > 50 Hz) that fall within the design\nband of the LIGO and GEO 600 interferometers, and\nthe search for their gravitational waves has developed\nrapidly since the start of data-taking runs in 2002. Data\nfrom the first science run (S1) were used to perform\na search for gravitational waves at twice the rotation\nfrequency from PSR J1939+2134 [2]. Two techniques\n\n1\n\nC.\n\nThe signal\n\nFollowing convention, we model the observed phase\nevolution of a pulsar using a Taylor expansion about a\nfixed epoch time t0 :\nn\n1\n\u03c6(T ) = \u03c60 + 2\u03c0 \u03bd0 (T \u2212 t0 ) + \u03bd\u03070 (T \u2212 t0 )2 +\n2\no\n1\n3\n\u03bd\u03080 (T \u2212 t0 ) + . . . ,\n(1.3)\n6\nwhere \u03c60 is the initial (epoch) spin phase, \u03bd0 and its time\nderivatives are the pulsar spin frequency and spin-down\ncoefficients at t0 , and T is the pulsar proper time.\nThe expected signal in an interferometer from a triaxial\n\nThe catalogue is continually updated and as such now contains\nmore objects.\n\n2\n\n4\n\nhttp://einstein.phys.uwm.edu\n\n\fH2 interferometers also both improved their duty factors\nto 80.5% and 81.4%, with longest lock stretches of almost\na day. The typical strain sensitivities of all the interfer-\n\npulsar is\nh(t) =\n\n1\nF+ (t; \u03c8)h0 (1 + cos2 \u03b9) cos 2\u03c6(t) +\n2\nF\u00d7 (t; \u03c8)h0 cos \u03b9 sin 2\u03c6(t),\n(1.4)\n\n\u221216\n\n10\n\nr * n\u0302\n+ \u2206E\u2299 + \u2206S\u2299 ,\ntb = t + \u03b4t = t +\nc\n\namplitude spectral density h/Hz\n\n1/2\n\nwhere \u03c6(t) is the phase evolution in the detector time\nt, F+ and F\u00d7 are the detector antenna patterns for the\nplus and cross polarisations of gravitational waves, \u03c8 is\nthe wave polarisation angle, and \u03b9 is the angle between\nthe rotation axis of the pulsar and the line-of-sight. A\ngravitational wave impinging on the interferometer will\nbe modulated by Doppler, time delay and relativistic effects caused by the motions of the Earth and other bodies\nin the solar system. Therefore we need to transform the\n'arrival time' of a wave-crest at the detector, t, to its\narrival time at the solar system barycentre (SSB) tb via\n(1.5)\n\nLHO 4k\nLLO 4k\nLHO 2k\nGEO600\n\n\u221217\n\n10\n\n\u221218\n\n10\n\n\u221219\n\n10\n\n\u221220\n\n10\n\n\u221221\n\n10\n\n\u221222\n\n10\n\n\u221223\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\nfrequency (Hz)\n\nwhere r is the position of the detector with respect to the\nSSB, n\u0302 is the unit vector pointing to the pulsar, \u2206E\u2299 is\nthe special relativistic Einstein delay, and \u2206S\u2299 is the\ngeneral relativistic Shapiro delay [20]. Although pulsars\ncan be assumed to have a large velocity with respect to\nthe SSB, it is conventional to ignore this Doppler term\nand set tb = T , as its proper motion is generally negligible (see \u00a7VI A for cases where this assumption is not\nthe case). For pulsars in binary systems, there will be\nadditional time delays due to the binary orbit, discussed\nin \u00a7III B.\nII.\n\nFIG. 1: Median strain amplitude spectral density curves for\nthe LIGO and GEO 600 interferometers during the S4 run.\n\nometers during S4 can be seen in Fig. 1. This shows the\nLIGO detectors reach their best sensitivities at about\n150 Hz, whilst GEO 600 achieves its best sensitivity at\nits tuned frequency of 1 kHz.\n\nINSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCE IN S3/S4\n\nB.\n\nThe S3 and S4 runs used all three LIGO interferometers (H1 and H2 at the Hanford Observatory in Washington, and L1 at the Livingston Observatory in Louisiana)\nin the USA and the GEO 600 interferometer in Hannover,\nGermany. GEO 600 did not run for all of S3, but had two\nmain data taking periods between which improvements\nwere made to its sensitivity. All these detectors had different duty factors and sensitivities.\nA.\n\nGEO 600\n\nDuring S3 GEO 600 was operated as a dual-recycled\nMichelson interferometer tuned to have greater sensitivity to signals around 1 kHz. The first period of\nGEO 600 participation in S3 was between 5th to 11th\nNovember 2003, called S3 I, during which the detector operated with a 95.1% duty factor. Afterwards,\nGEO 600 was taken offline to allow further commissioning work aimed at improving sensitivity and stability.\nThen from 30th December 2003 to 13th January 2004\nGEO 600 rejoined S3, called S3 II, with an improved duty\nfactor of 98.7% and with more than one order of magnitude improvement in peak sensitivity. During S3 there\nwere five locks of longer than 24 hours and one lock longer\nthan 95 hours. For more information about the performance of GEO 600 during S3 see Ref. [21].\n\nLIGO\n\nFor S3 the H1 and H2 interferometers maintained relatively high duty factors of 69.3% and 63.4% respectively. The L1 interferometer was badly affected by anthropogenic seismic noise sources during the day and thus\nhad a duty factor of only 21.8%.\nBetween S3 and S4 the L1 interferometer was upgraded\nwith better seismic isolation. This greatly reduced the\namount of time the interferometer was thrown out of its\noperational state by anthropogenic noise, and allowed it\nto operate successfully during the day, with a duty factor\nof 74.5% and a longest lock stretch of 18.7 h. The H1 and\n\nGEO 600 participated in S4 from 22nd February to 24th\nMarch 2005, with a duty factor of 96.6%. It was operated in essentially the same optical configuration as in S3.\nWith respect to S3, the sensitivity was improved more\nthan an order of magnitude over a wide frequency range,\nand close to two orders or magnitude around 100 Hz. For\nmore information about GEO 600 during S4 see Ref. [22].\n5\n\n\fC.\n\nsample per minute. The motion of the detector within\nthe solar system modulates the signal and this is taken\ninto account within the heterodyne by using a time delay given in Eq. (1.5), which transforms the signal to the\nSSB. Signals from binary pulsar systems have an extra\nmodulation term in the signal, as discussed briefly below,\nand these we targeted for the first time in S3/S4.\nThe search technique used here is currently only able to\ntarget emission at twice the pulsar's rotation frequency.\nEmission near the rotation frequency for a precessing\nstar is likely to be offset from the observed pulsation frequency by some small factor dependent on unknown details of the stellar structure [7]. As our search technique\nrequires precise knowledge of the phase evolution of the\npulsar such an additional parameter cannot currently be\ntaken into account. For the emission at twice the rotation\nfrequency there is no extra parameter dependence on the\nfrequency and this is what our search was designed for.\nWe infer the pulsar signal parameters, denoted a =\n(h0 , \u03c60 , cos \u03b9, \u03c8), from their (Bayesian) posterior probability distribution (pdf) over this parameter space, assuming Gaussian noise. The data are broken up into time\nsegments over which the noise can be assumed stationary\nand we analytically marginalise over the unknown noise\nfloor, giving a Student-t likelihood for the parameters for\neach segment (see Ref. [1] for the method). Combining\nthe segments gives an overall likelihood of\n\nData quality\n\nWhen a detector is locked on resonance and all control loops are in their nominal running states and there\nare no on-site work activities that are known to compromise the data, then the data are said to be science mode.\nAll science mode data are not of sufficient quality to be\nanalysed however, and may be flagged for exclusion. Examples of such data quality flags are ones produced for\nepochs of excess seismic noise, and the flagging of data\ncorrupted by overflows of photodiode ADCs. For this\nanalysis we use all science mode data for which there is\nno corresponding data quality flag. For S3 this gives observation times of 45.5 days for H1; 42.1 days for H2; and\n13.4 days for L1. For S4 this gives observation times of\n19.4 days for H1; 22.5 days for H2; and 17.1 days for L1.\nIII.\n\nTHE SEARCH METHOD\n\nOur search method involves heterodyning the data using the phase model \u03c6(t) to precisely unwind the phase\nevolution of the expected signal, and has been discussed\nin detail in Ref. [1]. After heterodyning, the data are\nlow-pass filtered, using a ninth order Butterworth filter\nwith a knee frequency of 0.5 Hz, and re-binned from the\nraw data sample rate of 16 384 Hz to 1/60 Hz i.e., one\n\np({Bk }|a) \u221d\n\nM\nY\nj\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\u2212mj\n\nPj\n\nXmi\n\ni=1\n\nk=1+\n\nPj\u22121\ni=1\n\nmi\n\n(R{Bk } \u2212 R{yk })2 + (I{Bk } \u2212 I{yk })2 \uf8f8\n\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\ntion holds well for our data. Large outliers can also be\nidentified and vetoed from the data, for example those\nat the beginning of a data segment caused by the impulsive ringing of the low-pass filter applied after the data\nis heterodyned.\nThe prior probabilities for each of the parameters are\ntaken\nas uniform over their respective ranges. Upper lim1\ni\nyk = F+ (tk ; \u03c8)h0 (1+cos2 \u03b9)ei2\u03c60 \u2212 F\u00d7 (tk ; \u03c8)h0 cos \u03b9ei2\u03c60 , its on h are set by marginalising the posterior over the\n0\n4\n2\nnuisance parameters and then calculating the h95%\nvalue\n(3.2)\n0\nthat bounds the cumulative probability for the desired\nis the gravitational wave signal model evaluated at tk ,\ncredible limit of 95%:\nthe time corresponding to the k'th heterodyned sample.\nIn Ref.

In the analysis presented here we have allowed segment lengths to\nA. Combining data\nvary from 5 to 30 min, so we maximise the number of 30minute segments whilst also allowing shorter segments at\nIn the search of Ref. [3] the combined data from the\nthe end of locked stretches to contribute. The likelihood\nthree LIGO interferometers were used to improve the senin Eq. (3.1) assumes that the data is stationary over each\nsitivity of the search. This was done by forming the joint\nof these 30 minute (or smaller) segments. This assumpwhere each Bk is a heterodyned sample with a sample\nrate of one per minute, M is the number of segments\ninto which the whole data set has been cut, mj is the\nnumber of data points in the jth segment, and yk , given\nby\n\n6\n\n\fsystems. To address this, we have included an additional\ntime delay to transform from the binary system barycentre (BSB) to pulsar proper time, which is a stationary\nreference frame with respect to the pulsar. The code for\nthis is based on the widely used radio pulsar timing software TEMPO [23]. The algorithm and its testing are\ndiscussed more thoroughly in Ref. [24].\nThere are five principal parameters describing a Keplerian orbit: the time of periastron, T0 , the longitude of\nperiastron, \u03c90 , the eccentricity, e, the period, Pb , and the\nprojected semi-major axis, x = a sin i. These describe the\nmajority of orbits very well, although to fully describe the\norbit of some pulsars requires additional relativistic parameters. The basic transformation and binary models\nbelow are summarised by Taylor and Weisberg [20] and\nLange et al. [25], and are those used in TEMPO. The\ntransformation from SSB time tb to pulsar proper time\nT follows the form of Eq. (1.5) and is\n\nlikelihood from the three independent data sets:\np(Bk |a)Joint = p(Bk |a)H1 . p(Bk |a)H2 . p(Bk |a)L1 . (3.4)\nThis is valid provided the data acquisition is coherent\nbetween detectors and supporting evidence for this is\npresented in \u00a7V. It is of course a simple matter to extend Eq. (3.4) to include additional likelihood terms from\nother detectors, such as GEO 600.\nIn this analysis we also combine data sets from two\ndifferent science runs. This is appropriate because S3\nand S4 had comparable sensitivities over a large portion\nof the spectrum. Provided the data sets maintain phase\ncoherence between runs, this combination can simply be\nachieved by concatenating the data sets from the two\nruns together for each detector.\nAn example of the posterior pdfs for the four unknown pulsar parameters of PSR J0024\u22127204C (each\nmarginalised over the three other parameters) is shown\nin Fig. 2. The pdfs in Fig. 2 are from the joint analysis\n\ntb = T + \u2206R + \u2206E + \u2206S ,\n\nwhere \u2206R is the Roemer time delay giving the propagation time across the binary orbit, \u2206E is the Einstein delay\nand gives gravitational redshift and time dilation corrections, and \u2206S is the Shapiro delay and gives the general\nrelativistic correction (see Ref. [20] for definitions of these\ndelays).\nThe majority of binary pulsars can be described by\nthree orbital models: the Blandford-Teukolsky (BT)\nmodel, the low eccentricity (ELL1) model, and the\nDamour-Deruelle (DD) model (see Refs. [20, 23, 25] for\nfurther details of these models). These different models\nmake different assumptions about the system and/or are\nspecialised to account for certain system features. For example, the ELL1 model is used in cases where the eccentricity is very small, and therefore periastron is very hard\nto define, in which case the time and longitude of periastron will be highly correlated and have to be reparameterised to the Laplace-Lagrange parameters [25]. When a\nbinary pulsar's parameters are estimated from radio observations using TEMPO the different models are used\naccordingly. These models can be used within our search\nto calculate all the associated time delays and therefore\ncorrect the signal to the pulsar proper time, provided we\nhave accurate model parameters for the pulsar.\n\n23\n\nprob. density\n\n10\n\nx 10\n\n0.6\n\n8\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n6\n95%\n0\n\n4\n\n0.3\n\nh\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n2\n\n4\n\nh\n\n0\n\n6\n\n0.1\n0\n\n2\n\n\u221224\n\n\u03c6\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n1\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0.55\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\u22121\n\n0.45\n\n0\ncos\u03b9\n\n1\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c8\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 2: The marginalised posterior pdfs for the four unknown\npulsar parameters h0 , \u03c60 , cos \u03b9 and \u03c8, for PSR J0024\u22127204C\nusing the joint data from the three LIGO detectors over S3\nand S4.\n\nof the three LIGO detectors using the S3 and S4 data,\nall combined coherently.

The choice of a 50 Hz gravitational wave frequency cut-off (pulsar spin frequency\nof 25 Hz) is somewhat arbitrary, but it also loosely reflects the split between the population of fast (millisecond/recycled and young) pulsars and slow pulsars.\nAll 154 pulsars with spin frequencies > 25 Hz were\ntaken from the ATNF online pulsar catalogue [13] (described in Ref. [26]). The accuracy of these parameters\n\nBinary models\n\nOur previous known pulsar searches [2, 3] have excluded pulsars within binary systems, despite the majority of pulsars within our detector band being in such\n7\n\n\fWe took a 'worst-case scenario' approach by adding\nand subtracting the quoted uncertainties from the bestfit values of all the parameters to determine the combination which gave a maximum phase deviation, when\npropagated over the period of the run (either S3 or S4),\nfrom the best fit phase value calculated over the same\ntime period. For example if we assume \u03c6(tS3 ) given by\nEq. (1.3) (ignoring for simplicity the \u03c60 and \u03bd\u0308 terms)\nis the best fit phase over the time span of S3, tS3 , the\nmaximum phase uncertainty is\nn\nh\n\u2206\u03c6err = max \u03c6(tS3 ) \u00b1 2\u03c0 (\u03bd \u00b1 \u03c3\u03bd )(tS3 \u00b1 \u03c3tS3\noi\n1\n+ (\u03bd\u0307 \u00b1 \u03c3\u03bd\u0307 )(tS3 \u00b1 \u03c3tS3 )2 + . . .\n, (4.1)\n2\n\nvaries for each pulsar and is dependent on the time span,\ndensity of observations and the noise level of the timing\nobservations. Clearly it is important to ensure that parameter uncertainties do not lead to unacceptable phase\nerrors in the heterodyne. Pulsars are not perfect clocks,\nso the epoch of the parameters is also important as more\nrecent measurements will better reflect the current state\nof the pulsar. Importantly, there is near-continuous monitoring of the Crab pulsar at Jodrell Bank Observatory,\nand as such its parameters are continuously updated [27].\nPrecise knowledge of the phase evolution of each target\npulsar is vital for our analysis, and possible effects that\nmay lead to a departure from the simple second-order\nTaylor expansion are discussed below.\n\nA.\n\nwhere the \u03c3s are the uncertainties on the individual parameters. Correlations between the parameters mean\nthat this represents an upper limit to the maximum phase\nuncertainty, sometimes greatly overestimating its true\nvalue.\nThere are 12 pulsars with overall phase uncertainty\n> 30\u25e6 in S3, which we take as the threshold of acceptability. A 30\u25e6 phase drift could possibly give a\nfactor of \u223c 1 \u2212 cos 30\u25e6 = 0.13 in loss of sensitivity for a signal. Nine of these are in binary systems (PSRs J0024\u22127204H, J0407+1607, J0437\u22124715,\nJ1420\u22125625, J1518+0205B, J1709+2313, J1732\u22125049,\nJ1740\u22125340 and J1918\u22120642) and in five of these T0 and\n\u03c90 contribute most to the phase uncertainty. For the\nthree isolated pulsars (PSRs J0030+0451, J0537\u22126910,\nand J1721\u22122457) the phase error is dominated by uncertainties in frequency and/or position.\nApplying the same criterion to the time-span of S4\nwe find that PSR J1730\u22122304 rises above the limit. For\nthis pulsar its parameter uncertainties do not affect it\nfor the S3 analysis as it was timed over this period, however when extrapolating over the time of the S4 run the\nuncertainties become non-negligible.\nIn total there are 13 pulsars rejected over the combined\nrun. This highly conservative parameter check reduces\nour 93 candidate pulsars to 80.\n\nPulsar timing\n\nUsing TEMPO, we obtained the parameters of 75 pulsars from the regular observation programs carried out\nat Jodrell Bank Observatory and the Parkes Telescope\n(see Ref. [28] for details of the techniques used for this).\nFor 37 of these the timings spanned the period of S3.\nThese same model parameters were used to extrapolate\nthe pulsar phases to the period of S4. The effect of parameter uncertainties on this extrapolation is discussed\nin \u00a7IV B, but is only important in its effect on the extrapolated phase. For those pulsars observed during S3 the\ninterpolation is taken to be free from significant error.\nThe parameters for 16 additional pulsars (for which\nnew timings were not available) were taken directly from\nthe ATNF catalogue, selected using criteria described\nin the following section. The parameters of the X-ray\npulsar PSR J0537\u22126910 were taken from Ref. [29] and\nthose for the Crab pulsar from the Jodrell Bank monthly\nephemeris [27]. The remaining 61 pulsars (from the original list of 154) were not timed with sufficient confidence\nand were excluded from the search. This included many\nof the newly discovered pulsars (for example the 21 millisecond pulsars in the Terzan 5 globular cluster [30]) for\nwhich accurate timing solutions have yet to be published.\nWe therefore had a catalogue of 93 timed pulsars for our\ngravitational wave search.\n\nB.\n\nC.\n\nTiming noise\n\nPulsars are generally very stable rotators, but there\nare phenomena which can cause deviations in this stability, generically known as timing noise. The existence of\ntiming noise has been clear since the early days of pulsar astronomy and appears as a random walk in phase,\nfrequency or frequency derivative of the pulsar about the\nregular spin-down model given in Eq. (1.3) [31]. The\nstrength of this effect was quantified in Ref. [31] as an\nactivity parameter A, referenced to that of the Crab pulsar, and in Ref. [32] as a stability parameter \u22068 . A is\nbased on the logarithm of the ratio of the rms residual\nphase of the pulsar, after removal of the timing model, to\nthat of the Crab pulsar over an approximately three-year\n\nError propagation in source parameters\n\nThe impact of parameter uncertainties on the search\nwas assessed for both the S3 and S4 runs. At some level\nthere are positional, frequency and frequency derivative\nuncertainties for all the target pulsars, and for pulsars\nin binary system there are also uncertainties associated\nwith all the binary orbital parameters. Some of these\nuncertainties are correlated, for example the error on frequency could affect the accuracy of the first frequency\nderivative, and the binary time of periastron and longitude of periastron are also highly correlated.\n8\n\n\fthe neutron star are strongly coupled on short timescales,\nthere should be no difference between the electromagnetic phase and gravitational wave phase. If the timing noise were purely a magnetospheric fluctuation then\nphase wandering caused by timing noise would not be\nseen in the gravitational wave emission. The third possibility, whereby the electromagnetic emission source wanders with respect to the mass quadrupole, could result\nfrom a weak exchange of angular momentum between\nthe parts of the star responsible for electromagnetic and\ngravitational wave emission. Jones describes the ratio of\nthe electromagnetic and gravitational timing noise phase\nresiduals (\u2206\u03a6) by a parameter \u03b1 = \u2206\u03a6gw /\u2206\u03a6em , with\nthe three types of timing noise described above corresponding to \u03b1 = 1, 0 and \u2212Iem /Igw respectively, where\nthe Is represent the moments of inertia of the electromagnetic and gravitational wave producing components. In\nprinciple this factor could be included as another search\nparameter. However, given the cost of including an extra\nparameter in this search, and given that it is plausible\nthat that all parts of a neutron star are tightly coupled\non the timescales of interest here, we will assume rigid\ncoupling between the two components, i.e set \u03b1 = 1,\ncorresponding to the gravitational and electromagnetic\nsignals remaining perfectly in phase.\nThe Crab pulsar is regularly monitored [27] on\ntimescales that are sufficiently short to allow its timing\nnoise to be effectively removed using a second heterodyne\nprocedure [37]. Like the Crab pulsar, PSR J0537\u22126910 is\nyoung, has a high glitch rate and also shows high levels of\ntiming noise [29]. Unfortunately, unlike the Crab pulsar,\nwe have no regular ephemeris for it that covers our data\nset, and timing irregularities are likely to be too great for\nhistorical data to be of use. We therefore have excluded\nPSR J0537\u22126910 from the analysis. For less noisy pulsars\nwe still need a method of estimating the effect of timing\nnoise on phase evolution that does not rely on continuous observation. One such estimate is the \u22068 parameter\ngiven by Eq. (4.2), which can provide a measure of the cumulative phase error. For those pulsars with a measured\n\u03bd\u0308 we use this estimate to obtain a corresponding value of\n\u22068 as shown in Fig. 3. This should provide a reasonable\nestimate of the timing noise over the timespan of the pulsar observation. Again we apply our criterion that cumulative phase errors of > 30\u25e6 are unacceptable. In Fig. 3\nthere are four pulsars (those with the four largest \u22068\nvalues), with measured \u03bd\u0308, for which this is the case, and\ntherefore timing noise could be a problem (having already\nnoted the Crab pulsar and PSR J0537\u22126910 as exceptions): PSRs J1748\u22122446A, J1823\u22123021A, J1913+1011,\nand J1952+3252. For pulsars with no measured \u03bd\u0308 we\nuse the approximate linear relation between the period\nderivative \u1e56 and \u22068 given in Eq. (4.3). The low \u1e56 values for these pulsars implies that timing noise will be\nnegligible.\nIn addition to the above, there are some pulsars in\nglobular clusters for which there is no \u03bd\u0308 and for which\n\u1e56 is negative (\u03bd\u0307 is positive), so no value of \u22068 can be\n\nperiod. \u22068 is not based on the stochastic nature of the\nCrab pulsar's timing noise and and is defined for a fixed\ntime (108 s) as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n8 3\n(4.2)\n|\u03bd\u0308| \u00d7 (10 s) .\n\u22068 = log\n6\u03bd\nThis assumes that the measured value of \u03bd\u0308 is dominated\nby the timing noise rather than the pulsar's intrinsic\nsecond spin-down derivative. Although generally true,\nthis assumption is not valid for the Crab pulsar and\nPSR J0537\u22126910, where a non-timing noise dominated\n\u03bd\u0308 can be measured between glitches3 . This quantity relates to the pulsar clock error caused by timing noise.\nThe value of \u03bd\u0308 is so small as to be unmeasurable for\nmost pulsars, although an upper limit can often be defined. Arzoumanian et al. [32] deduce, by eye, a linear\nrelationship between \u22068 and log \u1e56 of\n\u22068 = 6.6 + 0.6 log \u1e56 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u1e56 = \u2212\u03bd\u0307/\u03bd 2 is the period derivative.\nAs defined, \u22068 is a somewhat imprecise indicator of the\ntiming noise, not least because the time span of 108 seconds chosen by Arzoumanian et al. was simply the length\nof their data set. A preferred measure may simply be the\nmagnitude and sign of P\u0308 , but we shall continue to use the\n\u22068 parameter as our timing noise magnitude estimate for\nthe current analysis. A thorough study of timing noise,\ncomparing and contrasting the various measures used,\nwill be given in Ref. [33] (also see Refs. [28, 34]).\nThere is a definite correlation between the \u22068 parameters, spin-down rate and age. Young pulsars, like the\nCrab pulsar, generally show the most timing noise. The\ncategorisation of the type of timing noise (i.e., phase, frequency or frequency derivative) in Ref. [31] allowed them\nto ascribe different processes for each. The majority of\npulsars studied showed frequency-type noise, possibly a\nresult of random fluctuations in the star's moment of inertia. The actual mechanism behind the process is still\nunknown, with Cordes and Greenstein [35] positing and\nthen ruling out several mechanisms inconsistent with observations.\nTiming noise intrinsically linked to motions of the electromagnetic emission source or fluctuations in the magnetosphere, rather than the rotation of the pulsar, is important in the search for gravitational waves as it may\nallow the relative phase of the electromagnetic and gravitational signals to drift. The implications of timing noise\nin this context are discussed by Jones [36]. He gives three\ncategories of timing noise, not necessarily related to the\nthree types of timing noise given by Cordes and Helfand\n[31], having different effects on any search. If all parts of\n\n3\n\nThese two pulsars are among the most prolific glitchers, and in\nany global fit to their parameters the value of \u03bd\u0308 would most likely\nbe swamped by the glitch events.\n\n9\n\n\fV.\n\nHARDWARE INJECTIONS\n\n0\n\u22121\n\nFor analysis validation purposes simulated gravitational wave signals for a variety of sources (bursts, pulsars, inspirals and stochastic) have been mechanically injected into the LIGO interferometers during science runs.\nDuring S2 two pulsar signals were injected [3]. This was\nincreased to 10 injections in the LIGO instruments for\nS3 and 12 for S4 covering a wider range of signal parameters. Extracting and understanding these injections has\nbeen invaluable in validating the analysis.\n\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\u22068\n\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\u22127\n\u22128\n\nThe hardware injection signals are produced using software (under LALApps [38]), which was largely developed\nindependently of the extraction code. However, the codes\ndo share the same solar system barycentring and detector antenna response function routines, both of which\nhave been extensively checked against other sources (e.g.\nchecks against TEMPO in Refs. [1, 24]).\n\n\u22129\n\u221210\n\u221211\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221218\n\u221216\nlog(dP/dt)\n\n\u221214\n\nFIG. 3: The values of \u22068 for our selection of pulsars with\nmeasured \u03bd\u0308.\n\nThe signals were added into each of the three LIGO\ndetectors via the position control signal going to the end\ntest mass in one arm. Control signals in the digital servos\nthat maintain optical cavities on resonance were summed\nwith fake pulsar waveforms, modulating mirror positions\nto mimic the effect of a real spinning compact object\n(i.e. differential length motions with frequency and amplitude modulations appropriate for a given sky position,\nfrequency and spin-down). Furthermore, as the digital\nfake waveforms have to be converted to analog coil currents of suspended optics, the injected waveforms have to\nbe divided by the transfer function of the output chain\n(predominantly the pendulum), in order to produce the\ndesired differential length response of the cavity.\n\nassigned either through Eqs. (4.2) or (4.3). For these\npulsars the value of \u03bd\u0307 (and therefore \u03bd\u0308) must be rather\nsmall to have been affected by motions within the cluster\n(discussed more in \u00a7VI), so timing noise should again be\nnegligible.\nFor pulsars which were re-timed over the period of S3\ntiming noise will be negligible (for the S3 analysis at\nleast) as any timing noise, which usually has variations on\ntime-scales of several months to years, will have been absorbed in the parameter estimation. PSRs J1748\u22122446A\nand J1823\u22123021A were re-timed over S3 meaning that\ntheir S3 results will stand, although the other two will\nnot. However, being conservative we will remove all four\npulsars with large values of \u22068 , and PSR J0537\u22126910, in\nwhich timing noise could be problematic, from the S4 and\njoint analysis. Note that PSR J0537\u22126910 is vetoed by\nboth the parameter error criterion and our timing noise\ncriterion.\nThis reduces our final number of well parameterised\npulsar targets to 78 for the S3 analysis and 76 for the\nS4 and joint analyses. The 76 pulsars include 21 of\nthe 28 from the previous study of Abbott et al. [3],\nand so through our selection criterion we lose the following 7 previously analysed pulsars: PSRs J0030+0451,\nJ1721\u22122457, J1730\u22122304, J1823\u22123021A, J1910\u22125959B,\nJ1913+1011, and J1952+3252. The same selection rules\nwere not applied over S2, especially of note was that no\ntiming noise criterion was considered, which accounts for\nthree of the pulsars we lose between the two analyses.\nAlso our 30\u25e6 rule was strictly applied, which the other\nfour pulsars just exceeded.\nThe analysis was actually performed on all 93 timed\npulsars mentioned above, however the various parameter\nuncertainties preclude us setting upper limits on a total\nof 15 of these.\n\nThe extraction of these injections is described in detail\nin Appendix A. They show the relative phase consistency\nbetween the detectors over the course of a run. This\nmeans that a joint analysis combining the data from all\ndetectors is valid. The injection plots (see Figs. 7 and 8)\nshow what we would expect our posterior plots to look\nlike given a detection i.e. strongly peaked pdfs with very\nsmall probability at h0 = 0, as compared to those in\nFig. 2 where h0 peaks at zero.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nUpper limits\n\nHere we present 95% degree-of-belief upper limits on\nthe amplitude of gravitational waves (h0 ) from the 78\npulsars identified above. The value of h0 is independent\nof any assumptions about the neutron star other than\nit is emitting gravitational waves at twice its rotation\nfrequency. The results will also be presented in terms\nof the pulsars' equatorial ellipticity \u03b5, which under the\n10\n\n\fthe assumption that all rotational energy is lost through\ngravitational wave emission. The spin-down limit is seen\nas a natural crossing point after which gravitationalwave data, including upper limits, have a likely bearing on the nature of the neutron star. The spin-down\nupper limit will obviously depend on \u03bd\u0307. This value however, can be masked by radial and transverse motions\nof the object (see Ref. [40] for discussion of these effects). The Shklovskii effect [41], in which the pulsar\nhas a large transverse velocity v, will cause an apparent\nrate of change in the pulsar's period of\n\nassumption of triaxiality is related to h0 via Eq. (1.1) by\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n\u0013\n1038 kg m2\n.\n\u03b5 = 0.237\nIzz\n(6.1)\nTo obtain an upper limit on \u03b5 from that for h0 we assume\na fiducial moment of inertia value of Izz = 1038 kg m2 .\nWe discuss below in Sec. VI B the effect of relaxing this\nassumption. Pulsar distances are taken from the ATNF\ncatalogue [13] and are generally derived from the radio\ndispersion measures, with errors estimated to be of order 20%, although in some cases even this can be an\nunderestimate. A critical review of pulsar distance measurements can be found in Ref. [39].\nAll upper limit results from the individual S3 and\nS4 runs along with results from the combined run,\nwith and without GEO 600 included, are given in Appendix B in Tables III and IV. The GEO 600 data\nonly provides comparable sensitivities to LIGO at frequencies greater than 1000 Hz, and are therefore only\nused in the search for PSR J1939+2134 (at the time\nthe fastest known millisecond pulsar) in S3, and additionally PSR J1843\u22121113 in S4 and the combined run.\nInclusion of GEO 600 does not significantly change\nthe joint upper limits for these pulsars. For the majority of pulsars the lowest upper limits come from\nthe combined S3/S4 data set, although for 14 pulsars (PSRs J0024\u22127204I, J0024\u22127204S, J0024\u22127204U,\nJ0621+1002, J1045\u22124509, J1757\u22125322 J1802\u22122124,\nJ1804\u22122717, J1857+0943, J1910\u22125959D, J1910\u22125959E,\nJ1911+0101B, J2129\u22125721 and J2317+1439) the S4 results alone provide a lower limit. The combined S3 and\nS4 run results are presented in histogram form in Fig. 4.\nFig. 5 shows the results compared to a joint LIGO S4\nupper limit estimate curve, taken as the best sensitivity\nduring S4.

This provides a\nmeasure of intrinsic (rather than apparent) spin-down5\nand, when available, is used in the spin-down ratio results.\nThe observed value of \u1e56obs will also differ from its intrinsic value, \u1e56int , if the pulsar is accelerating \u2013 a likely\nscenario in the gravitational field of a globular cluster\n[40].

Recently masses greater than 1.6\u20131.7 M\u2299 with\n95% confidence have been measured [30, 45] for some\nsystems, making this reasonable to consider. More recently Lackey [46] found the highest moment of inertia\nto be 3.3\u00d71038 kg m2 for EOS G4 of Lackey, Nayyar, and\nOwen [47]. This is a relativistic mean-field EOS similar to the GNH family considered by Bejger, Bulik, and\nHaensel [44] but contains no exotic phases of matter such\nas hyperons or quarks. Consequently, we consider the\nrange of theoretically predicted moments of inertia to be\napproximately 1\u20133\u00d71038 kg m2 .\nThere have been recent attempts to infer neutron\nstar moments of inertia from observations. Bejger and\nHaensel [48, 49] derived a value for the Crab pulsar's\nmoment of inertia by equating the spin-down power to\nthe observed electromagnetic luminosity and inferred acceleration of the nebula. However, this (extremely high)\nvalue is dominated by the assumptions about the highly\nuncertain mass and mass distribution of the nebula as\nwell as the relativistic wind from the pulsar, and thus\ncannot yet be considered to give a reliable value. The\ndouble pulsar system J0737-3039 shows great promise for\ntighter measurements of the moment of inertia (and constraints on the EOS) in the near future [44, 50, 51, 52].\nHowever, for the moment we are left with the theoretical\nrange quoted above.\nAs suggested in Ref. [53], instead of using Eq. (6.1)\nto set a limit on \u03b5 assuming a value of Izz , one can use\nit to set a limit on the neutron star quadrupole moment\n\u2248 Izz \u03b5 without relying on any assumption about Izz . The\nlimit on the quadrupole moment can then be used to help\ndefine an exclusion region in the I-\u03b5 plane. This exclusion\nregion allows one to read off an upper limit on \u03b5 as a\nfunction of the EOS-dependent moment of inertia. The\nspin-down can also be used to provide exclusion regions\nvia the relation\n\n\u221222\n\n10\n\nJoint sensitivity over S3 and S4\nJoint design sensitivity for 1 year\nspin\u2212down ULs\nJoint ULs\n\u221223\n\n0\n\nh\n\n10\n\n\u221224\n\n10\n\n\u221225\n\n10\n\n\u221226\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\nfrequency (Hz)\n\nFIG. 5: The combined S3 and S4 upper limit results on the\namplitude of gravitational waves for 76 pulsars using LIGO\ndata compared to the joint sensitivity curve.\n\nfiducial number used in the literature. However, modern\ntheoretically computed equations of state (EOS) generally predict somewhat larger moments of inertia for stars\nmore massive than 1 M\u2299 , a group which includes all neutron stars with measured masses (see Ref. [43]). Therefore the dependence on moment of inertia should be considered.\nBejger, Bulik, and Haensel [44] give an overview of\nthe theoretical expectations for the moment of inertia.\nTheir Fig. 2 plots the moment of inertia vs. mass for\nseveral theoretically predicted types of EOS. The maximum moment of inertia they find (after varying the mass\nof the star) is 2.3 times the fiducial value, with stars of\n1.4 M\u2299 having moments of inertia 1.2\u20132.0 except for one\noutlying type of EOS. Typically the maximum moment\nof inertia occurs for a neutron star mass of 1.7 M\u2299 or\n\nIzz =\n12\n\n5 |\u03bd\u0307|c5 1\n.\n512\u03c0 4 G\u03bd 5 \u03b52\n\n(6.5)\n\n\fTheoretical contributions to the exclusion regions come\nfrom predictions of the maximum moment of inertia and\nellipticity. In terms of the exclusion region, our observational upper limits on h0 are far from contributing except\nfor the Crab pulsar, to which we now turn.\n\n42\n\n10\n\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS3/S4\nspin\u2212down\n\n41\n\n10\n\nC.\n\nIzz kgm\n\n2\n\n40\n\nThe Crab pulsar - PSR J0534+2200\n\nOf the known radio pulsars, the Crab pulsar has often been considered one of the most promising sources\nof gravitational waves. This is due to its youth and\nlarge spin-down rate, leading to a relatively large spindown upper limit several orders of magnitude higher than\nfor most other pulsars. The high rate of glitching in\nthe pulsar also provides possible evidence of asymmetry.\nOne glitch model favoured for the Crab pulsar involves\na change in the pulsar ellipticity, and breaking of the\ncrust, as the star settles to its new equilibrium state as it\nspins down [40]. In the 1970s, estimates of gravitational\nwave strains were spurred on by the experimenters producing novel technologies which allowed the possibility\nof probing these low strains, with Zimmermann [54] producing estimates of gravitational wave strains from the\nCrab pulsar ranging from h0 \u2248 2\u00d710\u221225 \u2212 10\u221229 .\nThe first searches for gravitational waves from the\nCrab pulsar were carried out using specially designed\nresonant bar detectors, with frequencies of around 60 Hz\n[9]. The most recent result using such a bar was from\n1993 and gave a 1\u03c3 upper limit of h0 \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u221222 [10].\nThis upper limit was passed in the LIGO S2 run, which\ngave h95%\n= 4.1\u00d710\u221223 [3]. Using Eq. (1.2), and taking\n0\n38\nIzz = 10 kg m2 and r = 2 kpc, gives a spin-down upper limit for the Crab pulsar of h0 < 1.4\u00d710\u221224, about\na factor of 30 below the S2 observational upper limit.\nHowever, the S2 limit on the Crab was at the time the\nclosest approach to the spin-down limit obtained for any\npulsar.\nOur new results for the Crab pulsar (and the other 77\ntargets) are shown in Table III. The results improve by\nup to an order of magnitude over those from the S2 run,\nand the majority of this improvement was between the\nS2 and S3 runs. The results for the Crab pulsar over the\nS2, S3 and S4 runs are plotted on the I\u2013\u03b5 plane in Fig. 6.\nThe diagonal lines in Fig. 6 mark the lower boundaries of\nexclusion regions on this plane using our upper limits obtained for the different runs. The dashed black diagonal\nline marks the lower boundary of the upper limit from\nspin-down as given in Eq. (6.5). The dashed horizontal\nblack lines give lower and upper bounds on the moment\nof inertia of 1\u20133\u00d71038 kg m2 , as given by our arguments\nin \u00a7VI B. It can be seen that our experimental results\ncurrently only beat the spin-down limit for moments of\ninertia at values greater than almost double the maximum of our theoretical range. However, over this range\nthe ratio of the gravitational to spin-down upper limit\nranges from 2.2 at the lowest value to only 1.3 at the\nlargest value.\n\n10\n\n39\n\n10\n\n38\n\n10\n\n37\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\nellipticity \u03b5\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nFIG. 6: The moment of inertia\u2013ellipticity plane for the Crab\npulsar over the S2, S3 and S4 runs. The areas to the right\nof the diagonal lines are the experimentally excluded regions.\nThe horizontal lines represent theoretical upper and lower limits on the moment of inertia as mentioned in \u00a7VI B. Theoretical upper limits on the ellipticity are much more uncertain,\nthe highest being a few times 10\u22124 .\n\nThe spin-down limit in fact over-estimates the\nstrongest possible signal because we know that much of\nthe spin-down energy of the Crab goes into powering the\nnebula through electromagnetic radiation and relativistic\nparticle winds. Thus it is interesting to ask how far we\nwould need to beat the spin-down limit to have a chance\nof detecting a signal allowing for what is known about\nthe non gravitational wave spin-down. Palomba [55] uses\nthe observed braking index 2.51 of the Crab pulsar with\na simple model of spin-down through gravitational radiation (braking index 5) combined with some other mechanism (braking index a free parameter) to place an upper\nlimit of about \u03b5 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 . This is about 2.5 times\nlower than the spin-down limit and 5.5 times lower than\nour result (for Izz = 1038 kg m2 ).\nThe Crab pulsar experienced two glitches between S3\nand S4, a large glitch on 6th September 2004 and a\nsmaller glitch on 22nd November 2004 [27]. The effect\nof glitches on the relative phase between the electromagnetic pulse and any possible gravitational wave signal\nis unknown, so there is uncertainty whether the (phasecoherent) combined S3/S4 result is valid. The combined\nresult stands, but the reader should be aware that it includes the assumption of trans-glitch phase coherence.\n\nVII.\n\nASTROPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION\n\nWe have produced new, tight, upper limits on gravitational wave signal strength from a large selection of\nknown pulsars and for the Crab pulsar we are very near\nthe fiducial limit set by spin-down arguments.\nIt can be seen from Table III and Fig. 4 that, for the\n13\n\n\f10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 ) and are reaching into the range permitted\nby more conventional neutron star EOSs (\u03b5 \u223c a few times\n10\u22127 ) [56].\nCurrently the fifth LSC science run (S5) is underway,\nand this promises to beat the Crab pulsar spin-down limit\nwithin a few months of its start. For many other pulsars\nwe should be able to reach amplitude upper limits of\n< 1\u00d710\u221225 and ellipticities of \u223c 1\u00d710\u22127.\n\nmajority of pulsars, the gravitational wave detector upper limits are at least one hundred times above those\nfrom the spin-down argument, so is there anything that\nwe can take from the results in terms of astrophysics?\nFirst we should note that spin-down limits on gravitational wave luminosity are plausible, but model dependent. They assume a model for the structure of the\nneutron star (for instance, that it is not accreting and\nis rigidly rotating, in addition to assumptions about its\nequation of state) and they take dispersion measure distance as a consistently good measure of true distance.\nThere is some considerable uncertainty associated with\nall of these assumptions. In contrast our observations set\ndirect limits on a source's gravitational wave strain.\nSecondly, for globular cluster pulsars the spin-down\nmeasured from radio timing observations is a combination of the spin-down intrinsic to the pulsar and acceleration along the line-of-sight a|| in the cluster's gravitational potential (see Eq. (6.4)). In general, the magnitude\nand sign of the acceleration is unknown but the intrinsic\n\u1e56int > 0 of millisecond pulsars is usually small and often\nsmaller than the extrinsic contribution. Only if \u1e56obs < 0\none can be sure that a|| < 0. Therefore, the limits derived\nfrom our gravitational wave observations provide the only\ndirect limits on \u1e56int which are independent from biasing\nkinematic effects. These can be combined with the observed spin-down to provide a limit on the acceleration\nlimit\nin the cluster, i.e. a|| \u2265 c(\u1e56obs \u2212 \u1e56gw\n)/P .\nFinally, it is interesting to note that our ellipticity limits are well into the range permitted by some models\nof strange quark stars or hybrid stars (\u03b5 \u223c a few times\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the\nUnited States National Science Foundation for the construction and operation of the LIGO Laboratory and the\nParticle Physics and Astronomy Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom, the Max-Planck-Society and the State\nof Niedersachsen/Germany for support of the construction and operation of the GEO600 detector.

This provides some evidence that\nthere is phase coherence between the detectors and that a\njoint analysis, combining the data from all the detectors,\nis possible.\nTwo main discrepancies have been identified as operational mistakes made during the injection procedure:\nPulsar7 was injected into H2 with a much lower amplitude than intended, and remained undetected, therefore\nno joint analysis was performed, and Pulsar0 was injected into H1 with an amplitude 1.6 times larger than\n\n15\n\n\fTABLE I: The parameter values for the pulsar hardware injections in S3 and S4.\nPulsar \u03b1 (rads) \u03b4 (rads) \u03bdgw (Hz)\n\n\u03bd\u0307gw (Hz/s)\n\nh0 (S3)\n\nh0 (S4)\n\n\u03c60 (rads) \u03b9 (rads) \u03c8 (rads)\n\n0\n\n1.25\n\n-0.98\n\n265.5\n\n\u22124.15\u00d710\u221212 9.38\u00d710\u221225 4.93\u00d710\u221225\n\n2.66\n\n0.65\n\n1\n\n0.65\n\n-0.51\n\n849.1\n\n\u22123.00\u00d710\u221210 8.49\u00d710\u221224 4.24\u00d710\u221224\n\n1.28\n\n1.09\n\n0.36\n\n2\n\n3.76\n\n0.06\n\n575.2\n\n\u22121.37\u00d710\u221213 1.56\u00d710\u221223 8.04\u00d710\u221224\n\n4.03\n\n2.76\n\n-0.22\n\n3\n\n3.11\n\n-0.58\n\n108.9\n\n\u22121.46\u00d710\u221217 6.16\u00d710\u221223 3.26\u00d710\u221223\n\n5.53\n\n1.65\n\n0.44\n\n4\n\n4.89\n\n-0.21\n\n1430.2\n\n\u22122.54\u00d710\u22128 1.01\u00d710\u221221 4.56\u00d710\u221222\n\n4.83\n\n1.29\n\n-0.65\n\n5\n\n5.28\n\n-1.46\n\n52.8\n\n\u22124.03\u00d710\u221218 1.83\u00d710\u221223 9.70\u00d710\u221224\n\n2.23\n\n1.09\n\n-0.36\n\n6\n\n6.26\n\n-1.14\n\n148.7\n\n\u22126.73\u00d710\u22129 5.24\u00d710\u221224 2.77\u00d710\u221224\n\n0.97\n\n1.73\n\n0.47\n\n7\n\n3.90\n\n-0.36\n\n1221.0\n\n\u22121.12\u00d710\u22129 2.81\u00d710\u221223 1.32\u00d710\u221223\n\n5.24\n\n0.71\n\n0.51\n\n8\n\n6.13\n\n-0.58\n\n194.3\n\n\u22128.65\u00d710\u22129 6.02\u00d710\u221223 3.18\u00d710\u221223\n\n5.89\n\n1.50\n\n0.17\n\n9\n\n3.47\n\n1.32\n\n763.8\n\n\u22121.45\u00d710\u221217 1.61\u00d710\u221222 8.13\u00d710\u221224\n\n1.01\n\n2.23\n\n-0.01\n\nGeo\n\n0.78\n\n-0.62\n\n1125.6\n\n\u22122.87\u00d710\u221211 7.5\u00d710\u221222\n\n1.99\n\n0.84\n\n0.37\n\nmodels could have been used.\nThe extracted amplitude and phase pdfs, after corrections described below in \u00a7A 3, are shown in Fig. 8 The\nobserved phase consistency between the detectors, means\nthat joint likelihoods, using all three detectors, can be\ncalculated. In general the values of h0 are well matched\nwith the injection values. It can again be seen that for\nthe strongest signals the narrow pdfs are offset from the\ninjected value in h0 reflecting the calibration uncertainties of 5-10%.\nThe binary pulsar injections show matches to their injected values. This is a good confirmation that the binary\ntiming code can track the phase well and has no significant errors.\n\nintended.\nThe injection of the signal into GEO 600 is described in\nRef. [57], and its analysis is described in Ref. [14]. It was\nfound that the injection performed during S3 was badly\ncontaminated and could not be used. However, a subsequent injection performed shortly after S3 has verified\nthat the signal parameters were correctly injected and\nextracted, validating the injection hardware and analysis\nsoftware.\n2.\n\n*\n\n0.77\n\nS4 injections\n\nThe 10 injections used in S3 were used again for S4\nto create artificial signals in the LIGO interferometers.\nHowever, their amplitudes were adjusted to give approximately the same signal-to-noise ratios as seen in S3, taking into account the better sensitivity during the S4 run.\nFor all except Pulsar9 the h0 values were reduced by\na \u223c half, with Pulsar9 being so strong that its amplitude was reduced by a factor of \u223c 20. These signals\nwere injected for the second half of the run from 8th\nMarch 2005 onwards. The updated h0 values are shown\nin Table I. There were also an additional two signals\n(Pulsar10 and 11), simulated to be from pulsars in binary systems, injected for the last day of the run. The\nbinary pulsar injections allowed the testing of the binary\ntiming code described in \u00a7III B as the injection code and\nextraction code were written independently. The binary\ninjection signal parameters for Pulsar10 and Pulsar11\nwere taken from Pulsar3 and 8 respectively, with the\nfrequencies changed, and amplitudes increased to make\nsure they were visible over the short injection time. The\nfrequency, amplitude and binary system parameters are\nshown in Table II. The binary system parameters were\nchosen to have one in a relatively eccentric orbit and one\nin a circular orbit. We chose fairly short periods, so that\nthey would have completed or nearly completed at least\none full orbit during the injection. The T0 values are\ngiven in the pulsar rest frame. For the recovery of the binary system injections the BT model was used, although\nas no relativistic parameters were included any of the\n\n3.\n\nCalibration Issues\n\nA brief note should be made of the effect of calibrations on the above extracted pulsar hardware injections.\nThe injections were for the most part analysed using exactly the same pipeline as applied to the general known\npulsar analysis. However due to the nature of the hardware injections some additional post-processing of the\nresults has had to be applied. To calculate the amplitude and phase of the injections, when applying forces\nto the interferometer end test masses, a reference calibration must be used. These reference calibrations are\ndifferent for each interferometer. For both S3 and S4\nthese reference calibrations differed by small, but not insignificant amounts, from the final calibration used when\nextracting the signals, meaning that upon extracting the\nsignals the amplitude and phase appear offset from the\ninjected values. As the difference between the reference\nand final calibrations are different for each interferometer\nthere will also be slight offsets between the extracted parameters between detectors. The extracted signals from\neach interferometer therefore have had to be adjusted to\nreflect these differences, determined independently of the\nhardware injections, and correct them so as to give the\nsame input signal. This allows the combined joint upper\nlimits to be produced.\n\n16\n\n\fTABLE II: The parameter values for the S4 binary pulsar hardware injections.\nPulsar \u03bdgw (Hz)\n\nT0 (MJD)\n\nx 10\n\n11\n\n188.0\n\n5.21\u00d710\u221222 52812.92041176 0.31963390 0.180567\n\n2\n1\n0.4\n\nh\n\n0.6\n\nx 10\n\n0.0\n\n1.65284\n\n322.571\n\n2.7564\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPULSAR2\n\n23\n\n2\n\n0.01\n\n\u03c90 (degs) a sin i (secs)\n\n15\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n4\n\n0.8\n1\n\u221223\nx 10\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\nPULSAR1\n\n23\n\n6\n\n0.2\n\ne\n\n1.30\u00d710\u221222 51749.71156482 1.35405939\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n0\n0\n\nPb (days)\n\n250.6\n\nPULSAR0\n\n24\n\n3\n\nh0\n\n10\n\n3\nh\n\n4\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n10\n5\n\n5\n6\n\u221223\nx 10\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nh\n\n3\n\n4\n\u221223\n\n0\n\n0.015\n\n0.06\n\n0.01\n\n0.04\n\n0.005\n\n0.02\n\nx 10\n\n0.005\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\nPULSAR3\n\n23\n\nx 10\n\n4\n2\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nh\n\n5\n\n0\n2.5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\u03c6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n5\n0\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n1\nh\n\nPULSAR5\n\n22\n\n10\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n10\n\n9\n\u221223\nx 10\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n4.5\n\n0\n\nPULSAR4\n\n22\n\n15\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n6\n\n0\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1.1\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n5\n\n1.2\n1.3\n\u221221\nx 10\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n0.15\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nh\n\n3\n\n4\n\u221222\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n\u22123\n\n6\n\nx 10\n\n0.4\n0.1\n\n4\n0.2\n\n0.05\n0\n\n5\n\n5.2\n\n5.6\n\nx 10\n\n6\n\n5\n0.5\n\n1\n\nh\n\n4.6\n\n4.8\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\nx 10\n\n5.4\n\n0\n0\n\n5.6\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c60\n\n4\n\n5\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nh\n\n8\n\u221223\nx 10\n\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n6\n\nPULSAR8\n\nx 10\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nh\n\n7\n\n0\n\n8\n9\n\u221223\nx 10\n\n0.04\n0.1\n\n0.02\n0.02\n\n0.05\n\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n23\n\n8\n\nx 10\n\n0.03\n\n5.2\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\ninjection\n\n\u221223\n\n0\n\n\u03c60\n\nPULSAR7\n\n23\n\n4\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n5.8\n\nPULSAR6\n\n23\n\n15\n\n5.4\n\u03c60\n\n2\n\n0\n4.4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0\n\n4.5\n\u03c6\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n5.8\n\n\u03c6\n\n6\n\n6.2\n\n0\n\nPULSAR9\n\n23\n\nx 10\n\nH1\nH2\nL1\nJoint\ninjection\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n5.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nh\n\n2\n\u221222\n\n0\n\nx 10\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03c6\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n0\n\nFIG. 7: The pdfs of h0 and \u03c60 for 10 isolated pulsar injections into the LIGO detectors during S3.
