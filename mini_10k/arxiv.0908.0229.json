In\ncontrast, for a mesoscopic system performing a random\ntrajectory in phase space and measured during a sufficiently short time, the entropy may either increase or\ndecrease. The 'Fluctuation Theorem' (FT), which relies only on the microreversiblity of the underlying equation of motion, states that the probability distribution\nP\u03c4 (\u2206S) for processes increasing or decreasing the entropy by \u00b1\u2206S during a time interval \u03c4 obeys the relation\nP\u03c4 (\u2206S)/P\u03c4 (\u2212\u2206S) = exp(\u2206S).\n\n(1)\n\nRemarkably, the FT remains valid even far from equilibrium. It has been proven for thermostated Hamiltonian\nsystems [1], Markovian stochastic processes [2, 3], and\nmesoscopic conductors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The FT is fundamentally important for transport theory, one of its consequences being the Jarzynski equality [9, 10], which, in\nturn, leads to the 2nd law of thermodynamics. It also\nleads to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Onsager\nsymmetry relations [11], as well as to their extensions to\nnonlinear transport [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nIn electron transport experiments the entropy production is related to Joule heating, \u2206S = qeVS /T , where\nq is the number of electrons (with charge e) transfered\nthrough the conductor during time \u03c4 , and T is the temperature. Hence the FT can be formulated in terms of\nthe distribution of transfered charge P\u03c4 (q) at sufficiently\nlong times, \u03c4 & e/I, as follows\nP\u03c4 (q)/P\u03c4 (\u2212q) = exp (qeVS /T ) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe FT has been experimentally verified in chemical\nphysics at room temperature [12], while tests of the FT in\n\nmesoscopic transport experiments in milli-Kelvin regime\nhave been lacking so far. On the other hand, recent advances in time-resolved charge detection by a quantum\npoint contact (QPC) [13, 14, 15, 16] made it possible to\nmeasure the distribution P\u03c4 (q) for single-electron tunneling through quantum dots. This opens the possibility of\ntesting the FT in mesoscopic transport.\nIn this article we report on experiments on the\ndirection-resolved full counting statistics (FCS) of singleelectron tunneling in a double quantum dot (DQD) system, which is probed by an asymmetrically coupled\nQPC [14]. We analyze the experimental data in the frame\nof the FT and find that the form (2) appears to be violated. However, it is still satisfied, if we replace the\ntemperature by an enhanced value T \u2217 . We attribute the\napparent overheating to the back action of the QPC detector and provide quantitative estimates of the effect.\nMoreover, we note that the form (1) of the FT, valid\nfor Markovian stochastic processes defined by general\nrates [2, 3], is satisfied, and we relate the entropy change\nto a ratio of the relevant nonequilibrium tunneling rates.\nExperimental test of the FT \u2013 The setup of our experiment [14] is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of the DQD\ncoupled to the QPC detector (Fig. 1a). The left and\nright gate voltages VGL , VGR applied to the quantum dots\nare tuned in such a way that only three charge states of\nthe DQD are allowed: |Li, |Ri, and |Di, denoting states\nwhere the left or right dot is occupied with a single electron, or where both dots are occupied, respectively. Accordingly, the current through the QPC, which is coupled\nasymmetrically to the DQD, switches between three different values (Fig. 1b). This setup allows distinguishing\nelectron tunneling in different directions. For example,\nthe switching |Li \u2192 |Ri corresponds to the transfer of\none electron from the left dot to the right one, while\n|Ri \u2192 |Li signals a transfer in opposite direction. The\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematics of the system. Only one energy\nlevel in each dot, with the energies \u03b5L and \u03b5R respectively,\ncontributes to the transport. (b) The QPC current switches\nbetween three values corresponding to the three charge states.\n(c) Test of FT (2) at several times. Lines with symbols: logarithm of lhs of Eq. (2) at several times; dashed line: q eVS /T \u2217\nwith T \u2217 = 1.37 K; dot-dashed line: q eVS /T . Inset: the distribution P\u03c4 (q) at \u03c4 = 4 ms.\n\ntime trace of the current taken over a sufficiently long\ntime \u03c4 allows one to determine the distribution of transfered charges P\u03c4 (q). An example of such a distribution\nis shown in the inset of Fig. 1c.\nFirst, we perform a direct test of the FT, see Fig. 1c.\nThe combination ln[P\u03c4 (q)/P\u03c4 (\u2212q)] indeed is a linear\nfunction of the transfered charge q. However, the slope\napproaches at long time \u03c4 the value eVS /T \u2217 where VS =\n300 \u03bcV is the value of the applied DQD bias voltage, but\nthe effective temperature T \u2217 = 1.37 K is a fit parameter\n(dashed line), which strongly exceeds the bath temperature of the leads of T = 130 mK (dot-dashed line).\nTo further test the time dependence contained in Eq.\n(2), we check the integrated form of the FT (Fig. 2a),\nP0\nP\u221e\n\u2212qeVS /T\nq=\u2212\u221e P\u03c4 (q)\nq=0 P\u03c4 (q) e\nP\u221e\nP\u221e\n=\n.\n(3)\nq=0 P\u03c4 (q)\nq=0 P\u03c4 (q)\n\nPlotting both sides of Eq. (3) with the value of the electron temperature, T = 130 mK, we observe a clear dis-\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Test of the integrated FT (3) in the time interval 0 < \u03c4 < 8 ms. The time \u03c4 is multiplied by the frequency of electron tunneling I/e \u2248 370 Hz. Squares: lhs of\nEq. (3) (denoted as P\u03c4 (q \u2264 0)/P\u03c4 (q \u2265 0)); dashed line:\nrhs of Eq.

(3) to the effective temperature (solid line),\nwe get a good fit for \u03c4 & e/I. As we will discuss below,\nthe apparent heating is caused by the back-action of the\nQPC electrometer, which operates in highly nonequilibrium conditions.\nThe experimental distribution of the transfered charge\n(inset of Fig. 1c) deviates strongly from a Gaussian\nshape. For illustration the second and the third cumulants of the charge distribution are plotted in Fig. 2b.\nThe normalized third cumulant remains close to 0.1 at\nall times. Since the FT (2) is satisfied for any Gaussian\ndistribution P\u03c4 (q), the existence of higher cumulants is a\nfurther indication of non-trivial behavior.\nViolation and recovery of the FT\u2013 Why does the FT\nappear to be violated? Quite generally, the FT for the\nsystem with four leads, depicted in Fig. 1a, should be\n\n\f3\nformulated in terms of the joint probability distribution\nP\u03c4 (q, q \u2032 ) of two charges eq and eq \u2032 transmitted through\nthe DQD and the QPC, respectively [7],\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u0002\nP\u03c4 (q, q \u2032 ) = exp qeVS + q \u2032 eVQPC /T P\u03c4 (\u2212q, \u2212q \u2032 ), (4)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the leads. Since only\nthe charge eq is measured, Eq. (4) should be integrated\nover eq \u2032 and afterwards, the right hand side reduces to\nexp[eVS /T ] P\u03c4 (\u2212q) only if VQPC = 0, which leads to the\napparent violation of the FT.\nThen why is the FT recovered by introducing the effective temperature T \u2217 ? In the experiment, the DQD is\nin the sequential tunneling regime. Then the probability\ndistribution P\u03c4 (q) can be derived from a master equation approach of the FCS [3, 17, 18]. It begins with the\n'modified' master equation\n\u2202t p(t) = \u0393(\u03bb) p(t),\n\npT = (pL , pR , pD ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ps is the occupation probabilities of the charge\nstates (s = L, R, D). The transition matrix has a modified form \u0393(\u03bb) depending on the counting field \u03bb measuring the electron transfer through the barrier between\nthe two quantum dots\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u2212\u0393RL \u2212 \u0393DL\n\u0393LR e\u2212i\u03bb\n\u0393LD\n\uf8fb .

In the longtime limit, \u03c4 \u226b e/I, the CF acquires an exponential form\nZ\u03c4 (\u03bb) \u2248 e\u03c4 F (\u03bb) , where F (\u03bb) is the eigenvalue of the matrix \u0393(\u03bb) with the largest real part. It satisfies\n0 = det[\u0393(\u03bb) \u2212 F I] = F 3 + KF 2 + K \u2032 F\n\u2212\u0393DR \u0393RL \u0393LD (ei\u03bb \u2212 1) \u2212 \u0393DL \u0393LR \u0393RD (e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 1), (8)\nwhere I is the identity matrix. Since the parameters K\nand K \u2032 are independent of \u03bb, we observe without solving\nEq. (8), that the CF satisfies the identity,\n\u2217\n\nZ(\u03bb) = Z(\u2212\u03bb + ieVS /T ),\nT\n\n\u2217\n\n(9)\n\n= eVS / ln [(\u0393DR \u0393RL \u0393LD )/(\u0393DL \u0393LR \u0393RD )] .(10)\n\nPerforming the inverse Fourier transform of Eq. (9), we\narrive at the FT in the form (2) with T replaced by T \u2217 .\nThe argument of the logarithm in Eq. (10) is the ratio\nof products of the tunneling rates corresponding to forward and backward cycles (i.e., the counterclockwise and\nclockwise cycles shown in Fig. 2c). The logarithm of this\nratio gives the entropy production associated with the\ntransfer of one electron through the system [2, 3]. While\n\nin the present example we find this transparent result we\nnote that in more general systems with many transport\ncycles, it is in general not possible to define a unique\neffective temperature [3].\nIn the experiments the tunneling rates are estimated as\n\u0393DR = 4kHz, \u0393RD = 0.3kHz, \u0393DL = 1kHz, \u0393LD = 1.5kHz,\n\u0393LR = 1.7kHz, and \u0393RL = 1.8kHz. The values lie in\na regime where they do not suffer from the finite band\nwidth of the QPC detector (\u223c 10 kHz). The effective\ntemperature derived from Eq. (10), T \u2217 = 1.14 K, agrees\nwell with the value 1.37 K obtained directly from the FT.\nQPC back-action \u2013 The tunnel rates are influenced by\nenvironmental effects. In particular, the DQD is necessarily coupled to the QPC, as modeled by capacitors CL\nand CR in Fig. 1a. The nonequilibrium current noise of\nthe QPC [19] produces fluctuations of the potentials of\nthe quantum dots e\u03b4VL,R , which in turn influence the\ntunnel rates [15, 20] as known from the so-called P (E)theory [21]. Introducing three such functions Pj (E) with\nj = L, R, dd we find\n\u0393RL = 2\u03c0 |tdd |2 Pdd (EL \u2212 ER ),\n(11)\nZ\n\u0393DL = \u0393R dE f (ED \u2212 EL \u2212 \u03bcR \u2212 E)PR (E), (12)\nZ\n\u0393DR = \u0393L dE f (ED \u2212 ER \u2212 \u03bcL + E)PL (E). (13)\nHere tdd is the matrix element describing tunneling between the two dots, the rates \u0393L and \u0393R characterize\nthe coupling between the dots and the leads. f (E) is\nthe Fermi function, where we fix the chemical potentials\nof the leads as \u03bcL = \u2212\u03bcR = eVS /2. The energies of the\ncharge states EL,R,D include the electrostatic energy of\nthe electric field stored in the capacitors. The rates \u0393LR ,\n\u0393LD and \u0393RD are given by the same expressions where\nthe Fermi function f should be replaced by 1 \u2212 f and\nthe argument of the functions Pj should be taken with\nopposite sign.\nThe spectral functions PL/R/dd are expressed in terms\nRt \u2032\nof the phase operators \u03c6\u0302L/R (t) =\ndt \u03b4 V\u0302L/R (t\u2032 ) and\n\u03c6\u0302dd = \u03c6\u0302R \u2212 \u03c6\u0302L as follows\nPj (E) =\n\"Z\n\n\u00d7 exp\n\ndt iEt\ne\n2\u03c0\n#\nQPC\n2\n\u2212i\u03c9t\n\u2212 1)\nd\u03c9 e [S0,j (\u03c9) + SV,j (\u03c9)](e\n.

The factors \u03baj characterize the coupling between QPC and quantum dots given by certain\nratios of the capacitances.\nWhen the QPC is in equilibrium VQPC = 0, the functions Pj obey the detailed balance Pj (E)/Pj (\u2212E) =\neE/T and thus \u0393RD /\u0393DR = e(ED \u2212ER \u2212\u03bcL )/T , etc. From\nEqs. (10-13) it follows that in this case T \u2217 = T . However,\nin the experiment, the QPC is biased at a rather high\nvoltage eVQPC \u226b T and the tunnel rates through the central barrier are approximately \u0393RL/LR \u2248 \u0393max /[1+(ER \u2212\nEL )2 /\u039320 ], where \u03930 = T (1 \u2212 T )(e2 \u03badd R\u0304)2 eVQPC /2\u03c0\nand \u0393max = 2 |tdd |2 /\u03930 . From the experimental values\n\u0393max \u2248 7 kHz, \u03930 \u2248 30\u03bceV, VQPC = 800 \u03bcV and T = 0.19,\nthe parameters can be roughly estimated as |tdd | \u2248 30\nMHz, \u03badd R\u0304 \u2248 5 k\u03a9. The latter value is in agreement\nwith other experiments, see i.e. [15]. Since the difference\nbetween the tunnel rates in opposite directions is significantly reduced, \u0393LR \u2248 \u0393RL , we observe that the effective\ntemperature T \u2217 is enhanced. From Eq. (10) we roughly\nestimate T \u2217 \u223c eVS / ln[\u03c0eVS /\u03930 ] \u2248 1 K, in good agreement with our previous findings, thus further supporting\nthe QPC back-action model. In order to reduce T \u2217 one\ncan reduce VQPC or the external impedance seen by the\nQPC R\u0304.\nOther environmental effects do not change our findings by much. In GaAs nanostructures acoustic phonons\nmodify the tunneling properties via piezoelectric and deformation coupling. At experimental values of the QPC\ncurrent IQPC \u2248 12nA the phonons stay almost in equilibrium [16]. Therefore, the phonon effect is absorbed in\nthe equilibrium part of the spectral density S0,j , and does\nnot affect the FT. An intrinsic back-action of the QPC\nis often addressed in the context of quantum measurement [22]. However, in the present case we estimate this\neffect to be negligible. Detailed discussions of these environmental effects and derivations of the theory presented\nin this article, based on the real-time diagrammatic technique [19, 23], will be published elsewhere [24].\nSummary \u2013 We have investigated experimentally and\ntheoretically the fluctuation theorem for Markovian\nstochastic processes by studying the direction-resolved\nfull counting statistics in a double quantum dot system\nvia a nearby quantum point contact electrometer. We\nfound an apparent violation of the fluctuation theorem,\nwhich we attribute to the non-equilibrium electromagnetic fluctuations generated by the shot noise of the quantum point-contact electrometer. We also demonstrated\n\nthat the FT is recovered if we adopt an effective value\nfor the temperature ten times higher than the electron\ntemperature. This effective temperature depends on the\nentropy production associated with the transfer of one\nelectron through the double quantum dot, which in turn\ncan be expressed by a ratio of forward to backward tunneling rates.\nWe would like to thank M. Hettler for helpful discussions.
