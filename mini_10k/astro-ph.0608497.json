The density of formation environment affects the dynamical evolution of galaxies; for example, the luminosity and color distributions of galaxies\ndiffer in field versus group environments (Girardi et al. 2003). Furthermore, for groups with\nlarge central members, the properties of the central galaxy correlate with properties of their\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nsatellite galaxies, such as the satellite-type fraction found in the group (Weinmann et al.\n2006), the alignment of satellite galaxies preferentially along the dominant galaxy's major\naxis (Yang et al. 2006; Brainerd 2005; Zentner et al. 2005), and the rotation of satellite\ngalaxies in the same direction as the host halo (Warnick & Knebe 2006).\nThe connections between the centrally dominant galaxy in a group environment and\nits surrounding satellite galaxies raise the question whether there might be a more direct\nkinematic connection between them as well. Kinematic similarities between the group and its\nbrightest group member would be consistent with both cold dark matter models, suggesting\nthe central giant and its satellite group are part of the same large-scale structure, and the\nhierarchical formation scenario, whereby the central giant would build up by accretion of\nsatellites in the group.\nNGC 5128 is an E/S0 giant galaxy in the positional and dynamical center of the Centaurus group of galaxies. Its remarkably close proximity (just 4 Mpc distant) also provides\na genuinely rare opportunity to study and compare the dynamics of the halo of NGC 5128\nwith the dynamics of the surrounding group at a level of detail that is difficult elsewhere.\nThe Centaurus group consists of 25 confirmed galaxy members (Karachentsev et al.\n2006), 13 of which have radial velocity measurements used in this kinematic study; see\nFigure 1. Within a projected distance of \u223c 1 Mpc from NGC 5128 lies NGC 5236 (M83).\nNGC 5236 is a dominant spiral galaxy surrounded by 9 other confirmed members within\nthe M83 group. Surrounding these two systems are 53 smaller galaxies that do not have\nconfirmed membership in either the Centaurus group or the M83 group. Therefore the\nbounds separating these two groups are still quite uncertain, and it has been suggested\nthat these two systems create a dumbbell system, similar to our own Milky Way and M31\n(Karachentsev et al. 2006).\nOnly one other kinematic comparison between the halo of a dominant galaxy and its\nsurrounding satellite galaxies (M87 in the Virgo cluster) has been presented in the literature\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2001). Virgo is a much more dynamically evolved environment than the Centaurus group. The Centaurus group, therefore, provides the chance to carry the comparison\na step further than just alignments of satellites and simple number statistics by looking at\nan environment closer to its initial structure.\n\n2.\n\nKinematics\n\nNGC 5128 has many hundreds of globular clusters (GCs) that can be used to define\nits halo kinematics and dynamics. The most recent studies (M. Beasley et al. 2006, in\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\npreparation; Woodley, Harris, & Harris 2005; Peng, Ford, & Freeman 2004) now raise the\nconfirmed globular cluster (GC) membership to \u223c 340 members with known radial velocities,\nwhich make up the sample used in this paper (this list includes \u223c 100 new clusters to be\npublished in M. Beasley et al. (2006, in preparation), written in tandem to this study). A\nfull catalogue of all GCs in NGC 5128, along with radial velocities and photometry will be\npublished in K. Woodley (2006, in preparation). The Centaurus group and neighbouring\nM83 group, have many smaller galaxies with radial velocity measurements. This combined\nmaterial enables a kinematic and dynamic comparison between the brightest group member\nand its satellite group.\nThe kinematics of both the globular cluster system (GCS) of NGC 5128 and the Centaurus group of galaxies are defined using the normal condition\nvr (\u0398) = vsys + \u03a9Rsin(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398o )\n\n(1)\n\n(e.g. Richtler et al. 2004; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2001) where vr is the observed radial velocity of the\nobject in the system, vsys is the systemic velocity, R is the projected radial distance of each\nobject from the center of the system, and \u0398 is the projected azimuthal angle of the object\nmeasured in degrees East of North. The quantities obtained by applying this equation to the\nsystem, with the known vsys = 541 km s\u22121 for NGC 5128 (Hui et al. 1995) held constant, are\n\u0398o , the rotation axis of the system measured, and the product \u03a9R, the rotation amplitude\nof the objects in the system.\nThe projected velocity dispersion is calculated using the maximum likelihood dispersion\nestimator described by Pryor & Meylan (1993),\nN\nN\nX\nX\n(vi \u2212 vsys )2\n1\n=\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03c3v + \u03c3vri )\n(\u03c3v + \u03c3v2ri )\ni=1\ni=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N is the number of clusters in the sample, vi is the cluster's radial velocity after subtraction of the rotational component, and \u03c3vri is the uncertainty in the velocity measurement.\n\u03c3v is the projected velocity dispersion determined by iterating through values of \u03c3v to find\nthe equality of Equation 2. The systemic velocity is again held constant at 541 km s\u22121 . The\nuncertainties were calculated from the variance of the dispersion using Equations 6, 8, 9, &\n10 from Pryor & Meylan (1993).\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Globular Cluster System of NGC 5128\n\nThe kinematic condition of Equation 1 was applied to the GCS of NGC 5128. A total\nof 343 GCs with radial velocity membership in NGC 5128 have been used in the kinematic\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndetermination. The radial velocities used are the weighted averages from all previous measurements studies of NGC 5128 and are described completely in K. Woodley et al. (2006,\nin preparation). The GCs were assigned weights in the kinematic fitting by considering two\ncomponents to their associated uncertainties: the individual observational uncertainty in\nvr , and the random velocity component of the GCS evident by the large dispersion in the\nconfirmed GC velocities. In almost all cases, this latter term dominates, leaving the clusters\nwith very similar weights.\nThe fitted values of \u03a9R and \u0398o were determined for projected galactocentric radial bins\nwith inner and outer radii listed in column 1 of Table 1. Successive columns give the mean\nradius and the outer radius in kpc assuming a distance of 3.9 Mpc, the number of GCs,\nthe rotation amplitude in km s\u22121 , the rotation axis of the GCs in each circular radial bin\nin degrees East of North, the velocity dispersion in km s\u22121 , the projected mass correction\nfactor, the pressure supported component of mass, the rotationally supported component of\nmass, and the total mass (see Section 3 for the mass discussion).\nThe radial bin 0-5 kpc has a different rotation solution from bins 5-10, 10-15, 15-25,\n25-50, and 0-50 kpc. In bin 0-5 kpc, these GCs nominally rotate around a similar rotation\naxis as the remaining bins, but in an opposing direction. This result may be real for this\ninnermost radial bin since it contains 55 clusters distributed evenly in angle over that portion\nof the sky (see Figure 2). However, the rotation amplitude is scarcely different from zero,\nand the system is clearly dominated by internal random motion there.\nFig. 2 displays the sine curve fits defined by Equation 1. Beyond a galactocentric\ndistance of 15 kpc, the observational bias of the detections (most of the known outer clusters\nlie along the isophotal major axis of the galaxy, which is where previous searches have mainly\nconcentrated) is evident by a clear lack of known GCs near the photometric minor axis of\n\u0398 = 119 and 299 \u00b1 5o (Dufour et al. 1979). This bias leads to higher uncertainties in the\ndetermined kinematic quantities in these outer regions. Nevertheless, it is notable that the\nkinematics of the metal-poor and metal-rich populations of GCs in NGC 5128 do not show\nany extreme differences in the outer-halo region and I treat them as a combined sample in the\nfollowing discussion. Full details of the kinematic solutions of the metallicity sub-populations\nare discussed in K. Woodley et al. (2006, in preparation).\nThe velocity dispersion of the GCS ranges from 105 to 166 km s\u22121 , and the entire system\nas a whole has a mean dispersion of 123\u00b16 km s\u22121 . These results show striking resemblances\nto those of Peng, Ford, & Freeman (2004): from an earlier and smaller sample, they find\nthe velocity dispersion of the GCs in NGC 5128 to range from 100 \u2212 150 km s\u22121 out to a\nprojected radius of 50 kpc, with the largest dispersion at 20 kpc (see their Figure 20).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.2.\n\nThe Satellite Galaxies\n\nThe same kinematic analysis was applied to the Centaurus group of galaxies. NGC\n5128, as the brightest member of the Centaurus group, was considered the center of mass of\nthe system, and the surrounding small galaxies as its satellites.\nThe distances of the surrounding galaxies were taken from Table 2 of Karachentsev\net al. (2006), while the distance to NGC 5128 itself, was assumed to be 3.9 Mpc from\nRejkuba (2004). The positions and radial velocities of the galaxies were taken from Table 1\nof Karachentsev et al. (2004). The rotation amplitude and rotation axis were determined\nfor the confirmed galaxies with known radial velocities that are considered Centaurus group\nmembers; Karachentsev et al. (2006) have confirmed 13 members in the Centaurus group\nand 8 members in the M83 group with published radial velocities in Karachentsev et al.\n(2004)).\nKinematic solutions were also determined for all satellite galaxies around NGC 5128, not\njust those with confirmed membership in Karachentsev et al. (2006), in two different ways.\nThe first method has grouped the surrounding galaxies into two independent bins. Bin 1\ncontains the nearest 27 galaxies in projected radii to NGC 5128, excluding any confirmed\nmembers of the M83 group. Bin 2 contains the 28th to 53rd nearest galaxies to NGC 5128,\nagain excluding any confirmed members of the M83 group. The results for the Centaurus\ngroup, M83 group, and the two independently binned samples are listed in Table 2. In all\nsubsequent plots, the radial values plotted for the GCs, M83 group, Centaurus group, Bin 1,\nand Bin 2 are the mean positions of radii in the sample for the rotation amplitude, rotation\naxis, and velocity dispersion, while the data is plotted at the outermost radii in each bin for\nthe mass plot.\nThe second method determines the same kinematics for the galaxies surrounding NGC\n5128, beginning with the first 14 galaxies in projected radial distance. Successively adding\none galaxy radially outward from NGC 5128 to the first 14 galaxies and recalculating the\nkinematic quantities was performed out to a maximum of 62 galaxies, including M83 group\nmembers, with results as shown in Table 3 (although only every third point is listed in\nTable 3, all points are plotted in subsequent figures)1 . In all subsequent plots, the radial\nvalues plotted for the cumulative galaxy bins are the radial value of the last galaxy in the\nsample. Tables 2 & 3 list, in successive columns, the bin description in Table 2 or the\nnumber of galaxies included in the calculation in Table 3, the mean projected radius and\n1\n\nThe dwarf galaxy, Tucana was not included in the present analysis because of its large projected distance\nfrom NGC 5128.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nouter projected radius in Table 2 and the outer projected radius in Table 3 of the sample in\nkpc, the rotation amplitude in km s\u22121 , the rotation axis in degrees East of North, the velocity\ndispersion in km s\u22121 , the volume density slope, the pressure supported mass, the rotionally\nsupported mass, the total mass, the B-band luminosity in solar luminosity units, and massto-light ratio. There appears to be no significant kinematic difference within measurement\nuncertainty for all the subgroups of galaxies used in this study.\n\n2.3.\n\nKinematic Discussion\n\nFigure 3 shows the rotation amplitude as a function of projected radius from the center\nof NGC 5128 for the GCs in NGC 5128, as well as the Centaurus group, Bin 1, Bin 2, and\nthe cumulative galaxy bins including up to 62 galaxies surrounding NGC 5128. Figure 4\nshows the rotation axis as a function of projected radius from NGC 5128.\nThe kinematic solution of the outer halo of NGC 5128, determined by its GC population, closely matches that of the satellite group. This suggests that the entire Centaurus\ngroup of galaxies could be thought of as an outward extension of its massive central galaxy;\nor conversely, that the halo of NGC 5128 behaves like an inward extension of the entire\ngroup. This result would be consistent with the idea that NGC 5128, starting from an initial\n(perhaps large) \"seed\" galaxy, could have built up from the accretions of many nearby small\nsatellites that would have preferentially come in along the major axis of the group. Alternatively, if NGC 5128 formed from the merger of a small number of large galaxies (perhaps\nonly 2 or 3 galaxies), it would not as easily explain the kinematic similarities since these few\nwould be less likely to come together along this same axis.\nFigure 5 shows the velocity dispersion as a function of projected radius from the center\nof NGC 5128, plotted for the same objects as Figs. 3 & 4. The cumulatively binned galaxies\nexhibit a similar range of velocity dispersion to the GCs in NGC 5128, from 83 \u2212 138 km s\u22121 .\nYet, the independently binned outer galaxies (Bin 2) have a much higher dispersion then the\ninner galaxies in Bin 1. This increase in velocity dispersion in the outer region is hinted at\nby the outer cumulative galaxy bins which exhibits a sharp upturn beginning near 1400 kpc.\nThis sharp change in velocity dispersion, and subsequently, the mass (see Section 3), does\nnot coincide with the addition of galaxies in the M83 group, which begins in the cumulative\ngalaxy bin 18 or with the large spiral, NGC 5236, is added in the cumulative galaxy bin 27\nplotted at the radial value of 907 kpc. The upturn in velocity dispersion is likely to be due\nto the non-virialization of the outer galaxies (refer to the discussion in Section 3.2).\nThe solid line in Fig. 5 represents a standard dark matter halo model fit to the data\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997, hereafter NFW), nicely tracing the dispersion of the halo of\nNGC 5128 and the inner galaxies of the Centaurus group as well, for a scale radius, rs = 14\nkpc. However, the entire Centaurus group over all radii and halo of NGC 5128 cannot be\nfit by a single NFW curve. That is, the group as a whole likely has a density profile that is\nshallower than R\u22123 at large radius.\nThe only other direct kinematic comparison between the GCS of a dominant galaxy\nwith its surrounding satellite galaxies is for M87 in the Virgo cluster by C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2001).\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2001) showed the velocity dispersions of the halo GCs in M87 and the satellite\ngalaxies clearly matched their constructed 2-component mass model for the Virgo cluster.\nBut, unlike our results for NGC 5128 and the Centaurus group, the Virgo galaxies have a\ndispersion that is much higher than the GCs in the M87 halo. These results are not surprising\nbecause M87 and the Virgo cluster contain a large X-ray halo, tracing the large dark matter\ncomponent in the Virgo cluster that dominates the potential well beyond the halo itself. In\nthe Centaurus group, we clearly do not see this same effect of a very massive, extended outer\ncomponent to the same degree.\n\n3.\n\nMass Determination\n\nThe total mass, Mt of NGC 5128 and the Centaurus group can be determined by the\naddition of the mass components supported by rotation, Mr , and random internal motion\n(\"pressure\"), Mp ,\nMt = Mp + Mr .\n(3)\nThe mass supported by pressure was determined here by the Tracer Mass Estimator,\ndeveloped by Evans et al. (2003) as a generalized projected mass estimator that determines\nthe mass enclosed within the outermost object in the sample. The (spherically symmetric)\ntracer population, in the Tracer Mass estimator, does not necessarily follow the same mass\nprofile as the system. Although the Tracer Mass Estimator is not the typically selected mass\nestimator to determine galaxy group mass, it allows a direct comparison with the masses\ndetermined from the globular clusters. The pressure supported mass in the Tracer Mass\nEstimator formulation is\nC X\nMp =\n(vfi \u2212 vsys )2 Ri\n(4)\nGN i\nwhere N is the number of objects in the sample and vfi is the radial velocity of the tracer\nobject with the rotation calculated in Section 2 removed. For an isotropic population of\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntracer objects, assumed in this study, the value of C is\nC=\n\nin (3\u2212\u03b3)\n4(\u03b1 + \u03b3)(4 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3)(1 \u2212 ( rrout\n)\n)\nrin (4\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)\n)\n\u03c0(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(1 \u2212 ( rout )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere rin and rout are the 3-dimensional radii corresponding to the 2-dimensional projected\nradii (Rin and Rout ) of the innermost and outermost tracers in the sample. The value of \u03b3\nis defined as the slope of the volume density distribution,\n1\n(6)\n\u03c1(r) \u221d ( )\u03b3 , rin . r . rout .\nr\n\u03b3 is found by determining the surface density slope of the sample and deprojecting the slope\nto three-dimensions in order to obtain the volume density slope. In Equation 5, \u03b1 describes\nthe potential of the system, and is set to zero in this study representing an isothermal halo\npotential in which the system has a flat rotation curve at large distances. Assuming isotropy\nin an anisotropic system can, however, overestimate or underestimate the mass by 30% for\nplausible ranges in anisotropy (Evans et al. 2003).\nAnother contributor to the uncertainty in the pressure supported mass is from the values\nassumed for rin and rout . Evans et al. (2003) suggest that rin \u2243 Rin and rout \u2243 Rout for\ndistributions taken over a wide angle (i.e. covering the outer halo reasonably well). However,\nthese approximations when taken at intermediate radial ranges within the distribution lead\nto an underestimate of the determined mass since the true rout can be quite a bit larger\nthan Rout . I have estimated the necessary correction factors for the values of rin and rout\nby generating Monte Carlo distributions of both the GCS of NGC 5128, and the group\nenvironment. For the GCS of NGC 5128, 340 globulars were randomly placed in a spherically\nsymmetric system extending out to 50 kpc with a r \u22122 projected density. The distributions\nwere binned in 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-50, and 0-50 kpc. For the satellite group of galaxies,\na similar spherically symmetric distribution of galaxies was generated for each subgroup in\nTable 3. The smallest and largest 3-dimensional and projected radii were determined in\neach radial bin and used to calculate the value of C in Equation 5 for the real positions and\nthe projected positions. I used a total of 500 simulated systems. The correction factors,\nMcorr , are multiplied onto all the pressure supported component masses in this study, and\nare shown in Table 1 for the GCs. The correction factors for the galaxies are quite small, as\nexpected, falling between values of 1 and 1.3.\nA recent study by Yencho et al. (2006) shows the use of mass estimators, such as the\nTracer Mass Estimator, can lead to incorrect mass estimates of up to \u223c 20% by neglecting\nsubstructure within the system in question. For the sample sizes used in this study, any such\nuncertainties are less than the uncertainties claimed for anisotropic orbital motion and the\nstatistical uncertainty in Mp itself.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe mass component supported by rotation was calculated from the rotational component of the Jeans Equation,\n2\nRout vmax\nMr =\n(7)\nG\nwhere Rout is the outermost tracer radius in the sample and vmax is the rotation amplitude,\ncalculated in Section 2. These Mr values are listed in Tables 2 & 3.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe Globular Cluster System of NGC 5128\n\nThe mass of NGC 5128 follows from its tracer population of GCs by determining the\nsurface density of the GCS and deprojecting the slope from 2-dimensions to 3-dimensions.\nThe surface density distribution of the entire GCS was determined by binning the known\nclusters into circular annuli of equally populated bins, giving each bin the same statistical\nweight to minimize biases (Ma\u00edz Apell\u00e1niz & \u00dabeda 2005), although, as noted above, the\ndistribution may still have spatial biases in favor of the major axis at large radii. The profile\nis shown in Figure 6. In the innermost region, within 5 kpc, there is incompleteness due\nto the obscuration of the dust lane and this region is therefore excluded from the mass\ndetermination. The surface density fits well to a power law outside of 5 kpc with a slope of\n\u22122.65 \u00b1 0.17 (reduced \u03c72 = 0.04 from a Marquardt-Levenberg fitting routine from Press et\nal. 1992). A value of \u03b3 = 3.65, was then used in the mass calculations.\nThe rotationally supported mass was calculated from Equation 7, and the determined\nrotation amplitude in each bin shown in Table 1. The determined masses are actually lower\nlimits as the inclination angle of the true rotation axis with the plane of the sky is not\nknown. Peng, Ford, & Freeman (2004) argue, using planetary nebula data, that NGC 5128\nis triaxial in nature and is viewed nearly edge-on. If so, the rotation measured would be a\ngood estimate of the true rotation of the system. In any case, Mr is small compared with\nthe pressure component, Mp .\nThe total mass of the system determined within the outermost cluster in each bin is\nlisted in Table 1.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Centaurus Group Mass\n\nThe mass was determined separately for the 13 confirmed Centaurus group members,\nthe M83 group members, the two independent bins of galaxies (Bin 1 and Bin 2), and for the\nlarger number of probable satellites with each additional satellite galaxy added in increasing\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nradial projection from NGC 5128. The adopted value of \u03b3 was determined independently for\neach list of galaxies in the same manner as was done for the GCS in Section 3.1, with typical\nvalues ranging from \u03b3 = 1.5 to \u03b3 = 3.2. The calculated masses with projection corrections,\nare shown in Tables 2 & 3 and are plotted in Figure 7.\nThe mass calculation for the group cannot be continued out indefinitely far because at\nsome radius, the fundamental assumption of virial equilibrium breaks down. At very large\nradii, the group has not had enough time to undergo full relaxation (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 1997). The\ndynamical and crossing times (Binney & Tremaine 1987), when set equal to a Hubble time,\noccur at radii of 1967 kpc and 1400 kpc, respectively, for the entire 62 galaxies surrounding\nNGC 5128. Similarly, Karachentsev et al. (2006) found a \"surface of zero velocity\" around\nCentaurus of 1440 kpc, coinciding with the upturn in velocity dispersion noted by the cumulative galaxy bins seen in Fig. 5 and discussed in Section 2.3. Thus an appropriate radial\nlimit for the mass calculation is R \u2243 1.5 Mpc. Thus, the large masses determined for the\nouter 15-20 galaxies, (includes Bin 2 and cumulative galaxy bins 42-62) are not valid as they\nare not likely virialized objects in the system. This is carried through to the mass-to-light\nratios determined for these outer objects in Section 3.3.\n\n3.3.\n\nMass-to-Light Ratios\n\nThe mass-to-light ratios were calculated from the total mass, Mt , determined in Section 3\nand a B-band luminosity and galactic extinction for each galaxy from Karachentsev et al.\n(2004).\nAll mass-to-light ratios are listed in Tables 2 & 3. The B-band luminosity for the\ngalaxy calculations include all of the galaxies within the outermost radii of each bin. The\nM83 complex, therefore, contributes to the luminosity of Bin 1 and Bin 2 in Table 2, although\nit is not included as part of the mass tracer population. The B-band luminosity of NGC\n5128 is 3.79 \u00b1 0.01 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 . This single galaxy makes up 66% of the entire light of the\nCentaurus group of galaxies. The mass-to-light ratio of NGC 5128 alone is 52 \u00b1 22 M\u2299 /L\u2299\nout to R = 45 kpc.\nThe mass of the Centaurus group of galaxies is determined from this study to be (9.2 \u00b1\n3.0) \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 out to the dynamical radius, leading to M/LB = 153 \u00b1 50 M\u2299 /L\u2299 . These\nvalues are quite comparable to the most recent study of Karachentsev et al. (2006) who\ndetermined the orbital mass of the Centaurus group to be 7.5 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , the virial mass\n8.9 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , and the mass determined within a zero-velocity surface including dark energy\n6.4 \u00b1 1.8 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 . Karachentsev et al. (2006) also determined a M/LB = 137 M\u2299 /L\u2299 .\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe M/LB ratio for the Centaurus group is larger than many other groups of galaxies in\nthe nearby universe (M/LB = 8 \u2212 88 M\u2299 /L\u2299 (Karachentsev 2005)), but mass-to-light ratios\nare typically larger for groups dominated by giant ellipticals, compared to spiral dominated\ngroups, such as the Milky Way (M/LB = 28 \u2212 29 M\u2299 /L\u2299 ), IC342 (M/LB = 18 \u2212 30 M\u2299 /L\u2299 ),\nor M81 (M/LB = 19 \u2212 32 M\u2299 /L\u2299 ) (Karachentsev 2005).\n\n4.\n\nBounding Argument\n\nIn brief, the satellite galaxies in the Centaurus group strongly indicate a possible connection to the halo system of its central group member. The confirmed members in both the\nCentaurus and M83 groups, with their brightest members separated by a projected radius of\n1 Mpc, have many surrounding galaxies with distances and/or radial velocities that do not\nhave confirmed group membership. It seems a possibility that these two groups resemble\nthe Milky Way and M31 as bound systems. Exploring this idea leads to the application of a\nsimple Newtonian bounding argument, used recently by Brough et al. (2006), Cortese et al.\n(2004), and others. If the two groups, Centaurus and M83, are part of a larger system, then\nthe inequality\nvr2 Rp\n\u2264 GMsin2 (\u03b2)cos(\u03b2)\n(8)\n2\nholds. In Equation 8, M = M83group + Cengroup = (9.65 \u00b1 3.01) \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 is the total mass\nof the confirmed system, vr = 25 km s\u22121 is the relative velocity between the two groups,\nRp = 907 kpc is the projected distance between the centroids of the two groups, and \u03b2 is the\nprojection angle between the plane of the sky and the line that joins the centers of the two\ngroups. The inequality in Equation 8 holds for all projected angles between 5o \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 89o ,\nusing the observed radial velocities of the Centaurus group and M83 centroids to be those\nof NGC 5128, 541 km s\u22121 , and NGC 5236, 516 km s\u22121 , respectively. The probability that\nCentaurus and M83 are bound can then be calculated from\nZ \u03b22\nPbound =\ncos(\u03b2)d\u03b2\n(9)\n\u03b21\n\n(Girardi et al. 2005). I find that the probability that these systems are bound is at the 91%\nlevel.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and Summary\n\nInvestigating the kinematics of the GCs in the giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128, and the\nkinematics of over 60 satellite galaxies in and surrounding the Centaurus group, has shown\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ninteresting new results. The rotation amplitude, rotation axis, and velocity dispersion of\nboth the halo of NGC 5128 and surrounding galaxies both have means of \u03a9R = 67 \u00b1 27\nkm s\u22121 , \u0398o = 162 \u00b1 22o E of N, and \u03c3v = 103 \u00b1 14 km s\u22121 . The masses determined with\nthe Tracer Mass Estimator and the spherical component of the Jeans Equation, lead to\nprojection corrected masses of (1.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 for NGC 5128 and (9.2 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 1012 M\u2299\nfor the entire Centaurus group. Mass-to-light ratios in the B-magnitude were subsequently\ndetermined to be 52 \u00b1 22 M\u2299 /L\u2299 for NGC 5128 and 153 \u00b1 50 M\u2299 /L\u2299 for the Centaurus\ngroup.\nThe similar kinematics between the halo of the brightest group member with its surrounding satellites suggests that the halo of NGC 5128 could therefore be thought of as the\ninnermost component of the entire group that surrounds it.\nThe Centaurus group is likely bound, although its outer regions are unlikely to be\nvirialized beyond R \u2243 1.5 Mpc. The global dynamics of the group that we are seeing,\ncould therefore represent the initial internal shear of the pregalactic filamentary structure\nfrom which it condensed. NGC 5128 could have formed early on as a galaxy that was\nalready centrally dominant, and now continues to build up by a series of minor mergers and\naccretions, leading to an averaging of the kinematics from the surrounding satellite galaxies\nthat we now measure in the GCs in the NGC 5128 halo. A single or small number of\nmajor merger events would not necessarily produce these kinematic similarities. This view\nis consistent with the recent work on the halo stars in NGC 5128 which have a mean age\nof 8+3\n\u22123.5 Gyr (Rejkuba et al. 2005), and the age distribution of the GCs which shows that\na high fraction of both metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are old (M. Beasley et al. 2006, in\npreparation). It would be interesting to extend this type of study to other nearby groups\nwith centrally dominant giants, although large samples of GCs and satellite galaxies with\nmeasured radial velocities are required in each case.\nK.A.W. would like to thank Willam E.
