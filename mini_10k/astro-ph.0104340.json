Mu\u00f1oz-Tu\u00f1on\n\nThe recent history of star formation in VI IZw\n403 is analyzed taking into account the dynamics of the starburst blown superbubble\nand the restrictions that follow from X-ray\nobservations, and from our H\u03b1 data. Our results show that the starburst energizing VIIZw 403 is NOT coeval, but rather the star\nforming phase has lasted for more than 30Myr\nand at such a low pace that most probably\nthe newly processed metals will not be ejected\ninto the intergalactic medium.\nVII Zw403 is a BCD galaxy, in recent years considered in many discussions related to star formation\nhistories and the possible impact of dwarf systems on\nthe surrounding intergalactic medium. It is an isolated system, however considered to be a member\nof M81 group. The X-ray observations (Papaderos\net al. 1994; Fourniol 1997) added more interest to\nthe system, as they revealed an extended kpc-scale\nregion of diffuse X-ray emission.\nSeveral models have been investigated with the\naim of matching the main observed parameters of\nVIIZw 403: The H\u03b1 luminosity (LH\u03b1 = 1.8 \u00d7 1039\nerg s\u22121 ), the X-ray power (LX = 2.3 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 )\nand the size of the diffuse X-ray emitting region (\u223c\n1kpc). In all of them we assumed that the photons\npresently produced by the stellar clusters are all used\nup to reestablish the ionization of the central HII\nregion. This fact is supported by the HI mass present\nin VIIZw 403. The H\u03b1 flux defines then the present\nstar formation rate which we have assumed to be\nconstant in time.\nWe have further assumed that the observed HI\nmass occupies a smooth low density halo but an important fraction of it is in a dense cloud component\n(Mcl ). This has a major impact on the evolution\nas it affects both the time required to reach a given\nsize as well as the X-ray luminosity produced by the\nsuperbubble.\nThe calculations were carried out with our 3D\n1 Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica Optica y Electr\u00f3nica,\nAP 51, 72000 Puebla, M\u00e9xico\n2 Main Astronomical Observatory National Academy of\nSciences of Ukraine, 03680, Kiev-127, Golosiiv, Ukraine\n3 Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, E 38200 La Laguna,\nTenerife, Spain\n\n3\n\nand L. M. Cairos\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. The calculated central star cluster H\u03b1 luminosity\n(a) for starburst of different duration, and bubble X-ray\nemission for different mass fractions in the assumed cloud\ncomponent (b) as functions of time\n\nLagrangian code, which accounts for the enrichment\nof the hot superbubble interior by the metals ejected\nvia supernova explosions (Silich et al. 2001). The results from the calculations imply (see figure 1) that:\n- The starburst energizing VIIZw 403 is NOT an\ninstantaneous or coeval star cluster.\n-The starburst formation time is larger than\n30Myr. This is also the time span required for the\nstarburst blown superbubble to reach the dimension\nand luminosity of the extended X-ray component,\nwhile producing the observed H\u03b1 luminosity.\n- During that time star formation has proceeded\nat an almost constant rate SFR = 4\u00d710\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n- The combination of the various parameters used\nto produce the best model imply that the newly processed metals in VIIZw 403 will not be ejected into\nthe intergalactic medium.\nREFERENCES\nFourniol, N. 1997, Thesis 'X-ray and optical observations\nof the HII galaxies'.\nPapederos, P., Fricke, K.J., Thuan, T.X. & Loose, H.-H.\nA&A, 1994, 116, L13\nSilich, S., Tenorio-Tagle, G.
