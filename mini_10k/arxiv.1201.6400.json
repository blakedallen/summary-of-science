We solve numerically Landau-Lifshitz type equations on a lattice and show that in the phase diagram of magnetization and interaction anisotropy, one can identify several distinct regimes of dynamics. These regions\ncan be distinguished based on the character of one dimensional solitonic excitations, and stability\nof such solitons to transverse modulation. Small amplitude and long wavelength perturbations can\nbe analyzed analytically using mapping of non-linear hydrodynamic equations to KdV type equations. Numerically we find that properties of solitons and dynamics in general remain similar to\nour analytical results even for large amplitude and short distance inhomogeneities, which allows\nus to obtain a universal dynamical phase diagram. As a concrete example we study dynamical\nevolution of the system starting from a state with magnetization step and show that formation of\noscillatory regions and their stability to transverse modulation can be understood from the properties of solitons. In regimes unstable to transverse modulation we observe formation of lump type\nsolutions with modulation in all directions. We discuss implications of our results for experiments\nwith ultracold atoms.\n\nMotivation. Understanding nonequilbrium quantum\ndynamics of many-body systems is an important problem in many areas of physics. The most fundamental\nchallenge facing this field is identifying emergent collective phenomena, which should lead to universality\nand common properties even in systems which do not\nhave identical microscopic Hamiltonians. We know that\nin equilibrium many-body systems typically fall within\ncertain universality classes. Basic examples are states\nwith spontaneously broken symmetries such as BEC of\nbosons and superfluid paired phases of fermions[1, 2],\nFermi liquid states of electrons and interacting ultracold\nfermions[3, 4]. We have numerous examples of emergent universal properties of classical systems driven out\nof equilibrium (see ref. [5] for a review). However very\nfew examples of collective behavior of coherent quantum\nevolution of many-body systems, which can be classified\nas exhibiting emergent universality, are known (several\nrecently studied examples can be found in refs [6\u201312])\nThe main result of this paper is demonstration of the\nuniversality of semiclassical dynamics of lattice spin systems and strongly interacting bosons in two and three\ndimensions, summarized in the phase diagram in Fig. 1.\nIn addition to fundamental conceptual importance,\nour study has strong experimental motivation. Rapid\nprogress of experiments with ultracold atoms in optical\nlattices makes it possible to create well controlled realizations of systems that we discuss [13, 14]. Tunability of\nsuch systems, nearly perfect isolation from the environment, and a rich toolbox of experimental probes, including the possibility of single site resolution [15\u201318], makes\nthem excellent candidates for exploring nonequilibrium\nquantum dynamics (see [10, 19] and references therein).\nSeveral intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena have been\ndemonstrated recently in ensembles of ultracold atoms,\n\nmz\n1\n\nVI +\n\n1/ 7\n\nIII +\n\nI+\n\nII +\n0\n\nIV1\n\n1/7\n\nIV2\n\n1\n\nJz / J\n\nII \u2212\nVI _\n\u22121/ 7\n\nI\u2212\n\nIII \u2212\n\n\u22121\n\nFIG. 1: Dynamical phase diagram of the anisotropic Heisenberg model (1) for initial states with finite magnetization in\nthe XY plane.

In this paper we study non-equilibrium dynamics of lattice spin models and strongly correlated bosons\nin optical lattices. Our starting point is the anisotropic\n\n\f2\nHeisenberg model\nHAH = \u2212J\u22a5\n\nX\nhiji\n\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c3iz \u03c3jz\n\u03c3ix \u03c3jx + \u03c3iy \u03c3jy \u2212 Jz\n\n(1)\n\nhiji\n\nwhere \u03c3 a are Pauli matrices. Anisotropic Heisenberg\nmodels with tunable interactions can be realized with\ntwo component Bose mixtures in spin dependent optical lattices[24\u201327]. Hamiltonian (1) also describes spinless bosons in the regime of infinitely strong on-site\nrepulsion[28]. In this case states | \u2193i and | \u2191i correspond\nto states with zero and one boson per site respectively,\nJ\u22a5 is the tunneling strength, and Jz is the strength of\nthe nearest neighbor repulsion. For atoms with contact\ninteraction and confined to the lowest Bloch band Jz = 0.\nNon-local interactions can be present for atoms in higher\nBloch bands[29] and polar molecules[30].\nSemiclassical equations of motion can be understood\neither as the lattice version of Landau-Lifshitz equations or asQdynamics in the manifold of variational states\n|\u03a8(t)i = i [sin \u03b82i e\u2212i\u03c6i /2 | \u2193ii + cos \u03b82i ei\u03c6i /2 | \u2191ii ], where\nall \u03b8i and \u03c6i are independent functions of time ( see supplementary material and ref. [31]). It is convenient to\nintroduce parametrization\ni 1/2\ni 1/2\nsin \u03b82i = ( 1\u2212z\n, cos \u03b82i = ( 1+z\n, ei\u03c6i =\n2 )\n2 )\nxi +iyi\n, then semiclassical dynamical equations are\n(x2i +yi2 )1/2\ngiven by\n\u1e8bi = 4 J\u22a5 zi (yi+1 + yi\u22121 ) \u2212 4 Jz yi (zi+1 + zi\u22121 )\n\u1e8fi = \u2212 4 J\u22a5 zi (xi+1 + xi\u22121 ) + 4 Jz xi (zi+1 + zi\u22121 )\n\u017ci = 4 J\u22a5 (yi xi+1 \u2212 xi yi+1 + yi xi\u22121 \u2212 xi yi\u22121 )\n(2)\nNote that variables (xi , yi , zi ) reside on a sphere. Specifying x2i + yi2 + zi2 = 1 in the beginning of the evolution\nwill preserve this condition at all times.\nWe consider dynamics in a state with finite magnetization in the XY plane (superfluid phase for hard core\nbosons), where close to equilibrium dynamics is determined by the Bogoliubov (Goldstone) mode. Considerable difference between the nonlinear hydrodynamics of\nhard core bosons on a lattice and the more familiar GP\nmodel was observed in the numerical study of solitary\nwaves in ref. [32](for a discussion of solitons in systems\nof ultracold atoms in the regime where GP equation applies see refs. [33\u201344]). Additional evidence for the special character of solitons in systems of strongly correlated lattice bosons came from the analytical study in\nRef. [31], which extended linear hydrodynamics to include the first non-linear term and the first dispersion\ncorrection to the long wavelength expansion and showed\nthat solitons were of the KdV type. In this paper we\nderive a full phase diagram of semiclassical dynamics of\n(1) for initial states with finite magnetization in the XY\nplane. Our approach relies on combining analytical results describing small density perturbations [31] with numerical studies of equations (2) describing dynamics of\nlarge amplitude modulations.\n\nPhase diagram. Hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic\nregimes. The main results of our analysis are summarized in fig. 1. Firstly there is fundamental difference\nbetween elliptic and hyperbolic regions in the character\nof linearized equations of motion. The hyperbolic regime\n(hyperbolic regions I and II in fig. 1) corresponds to the\neasy plane anisotropy of the Hamiltonian. If we start\nwith initial state that has finite magnetization in the XY\nplane, we find collective modes with linear dispersion,\n\u03c9 \u221d |q|, which describe Bogoliubov (Goldstone) modes.\nIn the elliptic regime we have easy axis anisotropy: lowest\nenergy configuration should have full polarization along\nthe z-axis, m = \u00b11. However our initial state has magnetic order in the XY plane. Thus we find unstable collective modes with imaginary frequency Im \u03c9 \u221d \u00b1|q|. This\ncorresponds to the dynamical instability in which small\ndensity fluctuations grow in time exponentially at short\ntime scales. There are also several special lines on the\nphase diagram 1: the SO(3) symmetric Heisenberg model\nwith Jz = J\u22a5 and fully polarized regimes m = \u00b11 (fully\noccupied or empty regimes for spinless bosons). In all of\nthese cases collective modes have quadratic dispersion,\ni.e. linearized equations of motion are of the parabolic\ntype.\nHyperbolic regime. Solitons. Hyperbolic regions I and\nII are differentiated further according to the character of\nsolitonic excitations. In region I+ we find particle-like\none dimensional solitons, which are unstable to modulation in the transverse directions. In region I\u2212 we find\nhole-like one dimensional solitons unstable to transverse\nmodulations. In regions II\u00b1 we find particle and hole-like\nsolitons stable to transverse modulation. Lines IV1 and\nIV2 correspond to two different regimes of the mKdV\nequation. Both hole and particle-type soliton solutions\ncan be found on the line IV2 . Both types of solitons are\nsuppressed close to the line IV1 .\nIn the limit of small amplitude and long wavelength\ninhomogeneities non-linear hydrodynamic equations (2)\ncan be mapped to KdV type equations and solitons can\nbe studied analytically (see supplementary material and\nref. [31]). This analysis can be used to obtain explicit expressions for boundaries of different regimes in fig. 1. In\nthe general case of large amplitude inhomogeneities one\nneeds to solve lattice equations (2) numerically. Surprisingly we find that in even for large amplitude solitons,\ntheir properties, including stability to transverse fluctuations, are consistent with small amplitude solitons.\nHence the phase diagram in fig. 1 is generic.\nWhile we can not present all of our numerical results,\nwe provide examples, which demonstrate properties of\nlarge amplitude solitons. Fig. 2 shows particle- and holetype solitons in regions I+ and II+ respectively. These\nspecific solutions were chosen arbitrarily from a plethora\nof solitons with different amplitudes and velocities, which\ncan be found in the system for the same values of microscopic parameters. In these specific examples only\none dimensional variation of parameters were considered\nwhen solving lattice equations (2).

These\nfigures contrast stable and unstable regimes. In the stable regime II+ transverse modulation does not lead to\nany dramatic change of the soliton solution. Analogous dynamics takes place in the other stable regime,\nII\u2212 , except for a change from hole solitons to particle\nones. In the unstable regimes I+ (the same behavior\nis observed in I\u2212 ) we observe that transverse modulation leads to the formation of two-dimensional \"lump\"\nsolutions. For small amplitude modulations stability to\ntransverse modulation can be studied analytically using\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili equation [31, 45].

We now discuss the problem of the decay of magnetization step in a system of\ntype (1). Configurations of this type have been recently\nrealized in 3d magnetic systems using tunable magnetic\nfield gradient[46]. They can be created for strongly correlated spinless bosons in 2d optical lattices using local\naddressability [17, 18]. Besides this experimental motivation, relaxation of the magnetization (density) step is an\nimportant methodological problem. Dynamics starting\nfrom this state allows extended unattenuated propagation of the magnetization (density) modulation, which\nshould amplify the role of nonlinearities. This may be\ncontrasted to e.g. dynamics starting with a ring type inhomogeneity, where already at the level of linear hydrodynamics there is a decrease of the magnetization (den-\n\n\f4\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.1\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.6\n-0.1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n-0.2\n0.5\n-0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n0.3\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n0.3\n3000\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n3200\n\n3400\n\n3600\n\n-0.5\n4000\n\n3800\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.65\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n0.65\n47700\n\n47750\n\n47800\n\n47850\n\n47900\n\n47950\n\n48000\n\nFIG. 6: Decay of the density step in Region I+ .

In classical hydrodynamics decay of the density step is one of the canonical problems\nconsidered in Refs. [47\u201349].\nFig. 6 shows the main stages of the magnetization step\ndecay in regions I\u00b1 , II\u00b1 , IV: separation of left- and rightmoving parts, steepening of one of the moving edges and\nformation of the oscillatory front. While there is general\nagreement between small amplitude limit analyzed in ref.\n[31] and results of numerical analysis of lattice equations\npresented in fig. 6, there is one important difference. In\nthe oscillatory region appearing from the decay of a large\namplitude magnetization step we observe pairing of solitons, which can be understood as a result of interaction\nbetween solitons through the background of small amplitude waves. This is manifestation of the absence of exact\nintegrability of lattice equations (2).\nExperimental considerations.\nDirect experimental\ntests of theoretical results presented in this paper can\nbe obtained by analyzing dynamics starting from soliton\nconfigurations of ultracold atoms in optical lattices, such\nas shown in figs 2, 3, 4. These figures show that lattices of the order of tens of sites should be sufficient for\nsuch studies. Experimentally soliton like initial states\ncan be created and their dynamics can be studied using single site resolution and addressability available in\ncurrent experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Density modulation can be achieved by letting the\nsystem reach equilibrium with a specified inhomogeneous\npotential. Phase modulation can be done by applying a\nshort potential pulse. We note that clear signatures of\nsoliton dynamics can be achieved by starting with initial states that have density modulation and no phase\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFIG. 7: Soliton dynamics in the presence of parabolic potential. Soliton propagation is stable when parabolic potential\nis not taking the system across boundaries of different regions(figs a-c). Crossing the phase boundary causes the soliton break-up (fig d). Green line marks the boundary between\nregions I+ and II+ .\n\nimprinting. In this case a pair of solitons appears and\npropagates in the opposite directions. This process takes\nplace on relatively short time scales accessible to experiments. Additional details about this procedure are discussed in the supplementary material. We also note that\nto observe soliton dynamics one does not need to create initial configuration, which match theoretically calculated solitonic solutions exactly. Numerical analysis\nof (2) shows that initial conditions with spatially localized excess or deficit of magnetization (density) separate\nreasonably fast into solitons and the wave background.\nOn the other hand observing all stages of the magnetization (density) step decay requires longer times and larger\nsystem sizes. Another important experimental consideration, which we did not address so far, is the presence of\nthe parabolic confining potential in all of the currently\navailable experimental set-ups. In fig 7 we show that as\nlong as the chemical potential change is not taking the\nsystem across one of the boundaries in fig. 1, it has no\nstrong effect on the soliton propagation. However crossing any of the boundaries leads to the soliton break-up.\nSummary. We analyzed semiclassical dynamics of\nanisotropic Heisenberg models in dimension higher than\none. Combining analytical study of small amplitude,\nlong wavelength excitations with numerical studies of\nlarge amplitude, short wavelength excitations we demonstrated the existence of a universal dynamical phase diagram, in which different regions can be distinguished\nbased on the character of one dimensional solitonic excitations, and stability of such solitons to transverse modulation. Universality of dynamics, which we find from\ndirect solution of lattice equations, is very intriguing.\nOur model is not a special lattice regularization of an\n\n\f5\nintegrable continuum system. We analyze lattice model\ndescribing real physical systems which, in principle, can\ncontain many terms breaking universality.\nWe thank I. Bloch, M. Greiner, M. Lewenstein, D.\nPekker, and L.
