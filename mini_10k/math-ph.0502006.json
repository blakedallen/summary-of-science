Introduction\nThe objective of this work is to present results on the stability of the absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum of Schr\u00f6dinger operators on tree graphs, under the addition\nof weak but extensive disorder in the form of a random potential.\nThe background for this analysis is the generally known phenomenon of Anderson localization: the addition of extensive disorder to a linear operator results\nin the localization of the eigenfunctions corresponding to certain spectral regimes,\nwhere the spectral type changes to pure-point. The localization regime may cover\nthe full spectral range \u2013 as is typically the case in one dimension even at arbitrarily\nsmall, but non-zero strength of the disorder [6,12,9,24,29]. A major challenge for\nanalysts is to shed light on extended states and ac spectrum. We shall not review\nhere the growing body of interesting works on decaying disorder, as our main focus concerns the homogeneous case. In this case the only proof of the persistence\nof de-localization \u2013 in the sense of the existence of extended states, or of absolutely continuous (ac) spectrum in a certain energy range \u2013 was obtained for the\nLaplacian on a regular tree perturbed by a weak random potential which is given\nby a collection of iid random variables [16,18]. In this work we return to the tree\nsetup and present a different set of tools.\n1.1. Statement of the main result\nWe consider random Schr\u00f6dinger operators on the Hilbert space l2 (T) where T is\nthe set of vertices of a regular rooted tree graph in which each vertex has K \u2265 2\nforward neighbors (see Subsection 1.2 for some of the basic terminology). These\noperators are linear and of the form\nH\u03bb (\u03c9) := T + U + \u03bb V (\u03c9)\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere:\n1. The operator T corresponds to the adjacency matrix, i.e., the discrete version\nof the Laplacian without the diagonal terms:\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nT \u03c8 x :=\n\u03c8y\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 l2 T ,\n(1.2)\ny\n\nwhere the sum runs over all nearest neighbor vertices of x \u2208 T.\n2. The term U is a multiplication operator by a real-valued function {Ux }x\u2208T\nwhich is radial and \u03c4 -periodic in |x|, the distance to the root.\n3. The real parameter \u03bb controls the strength of the random perturbation.\n4. The symbol \u03c9 represents the randomness, i.e., V (\u03c9) is a multiplication operator which \u0001is given in terms of an element {\u03c9x }x\u2208T from the probability\nspace RT , P . Averages over that probability space will be denoted below by\nE[ * ].\n\nFor each \u03bb and \u03c9 the operator H\u03bb (\u03c9) is essentially self adjoint on the domain of\nfunctions of compact support. It is important for our discussion that the unperturbed part\nH0 = T + U\n(1.3)\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n3\n\nis a radially periodic Schr\u00f6dinger operator on l2 (T) in the sense described in 1.\nand 2. above. In order to prepare for the statement of our main result, let us note\ntwo facts about the spectra of such operators (see Appendix A).\nProposition 1.1. Let U be radial and periodic and V (\u03c9) be radial, i.e., Vx (\u03c9) =\n\u03c9|x| , with {\u03c9n }n\u2208N0 iid non-constant random variables. Then:\n1. The ac spectrum of H0 = T + U on l2 (T) consists of a finite union of closed\nintervals.\n2. For every \u03bb 6= 0 the ac spectrum of H\u03bb (\u03c9) = H0 + \u03bbV (\u03c9) vanishes for almost\nall \u03c9.\nOur main result is that the effect on the ac spectrum is different when the perturbation is by a random potential whose values over different branches of the tree\nare only weakly correlated. Altogether, in this paper the random potential V (\u03c9) is\nassumed to have the following properties, whose precise definitions can be found\nin Subsection 1.2 below.\nA1:\nA2:\nA3:\n\nThe probability measure P of the random potential is stationary under the\nsymmetries associated with the graph endomorphisms of the rooted tree.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThe values of the potential are log-integrable: E log(1 + |Vx (*)|) < \u221e\nfor each x \u2208 T.\nThe probability measure P of the random potential is weakly correlated.\n\nThese assumptions in particular ensure that the ac spectrum of H\u03bb (\u03c9) coincides\nwith a non-random Borel set \u03a3ac (\u03bb) for almost all \u03c9.\nFollowing is our main result.\nTheorem 1.1. Let U be radial and periodic and V (\u03c9) satisfy A1, A2 and A3.\nThen the random Schr\u00f6dinger operator H\u03bb (\u03c9) = H0 + \u03bbV (\u03c9) has the following\nproperties.\n1. The ac spectrum is continuous at \u03bb = 0 in the sense that for any Borel set\nI \u2286 \u03a3ac (0)\nlim L [I \u2229 \u03a3ac (\u03bb)] = L [I \u2229 \u03a3ac (0)]\n(1.4)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nwhere L denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n2. Over closed Borel sets I \u2286 \u03a3ac (0) which are free of singular spectrum of H0\nthe density of the ac component of the spectral measure associated with \u03b40 is\nL1 -continuous at \u03bb = 0 in the sense that:\nlim\n\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nZ\n\nI\n\nE\n\n\u0002\n\nIm h\u03b40 , (H\u03bb (*) \u2212 E \u2212 i0)\u22121 \u03b40 i\n\u2212 Im h\u03b40 , (H0 \u2212 E \u2212 i0)\u22121 \u03b40 i\n\n\u0003\n\ndE = 0. (1.5)\n\nHere \u03b40 \u2208 l2 (T) is the indicator function supported at the root.\n\n\f4\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\n1.2. The assumptions\nA rooted tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles. In a slight abuse of\nnotation, we shall use the symbol T for both the tree graph and the set of its vertices. The root is a particular vertex which we denote 0 \u2208 T. For each x \u2208 T we\ndenote by |x| the number of edges in the unique path connecting it to the root. In\na regular tree, as those considered here, each vertex other than the root has K + 1\nneighbors, one towards the root and K in what we refer to as the forward direction. The set of the forward neighbors of x is denoted by Nx+ . We say that y \u2208 T\nis in the future of x \u2208 T if the path connecting y and the root runs through x. The\nsubtree consisting of all the vertices in the future of x, with x regarded as its root,\nis denoted by Tx .\nThe symmetries referred to in A1 are associated with endomorphisms of the\nrooted tree. These are mappings s : T \u2192 T preserving the adjacency relation\nand the orientation away from the root, i.e., neighboring vertices are mapped onto\nneighboring vertices, and if x is in the future of y then sx is in the future of sy.\nTo each such endomorphism corresponds a transformation S : CT \u2192 CT defined\nby (S\u03c9)x := \u03c9sx for all x \u2208 T. A probability measure \u03bd on CT is said to be\nstationary if for all such mappings and all bounded measurable F : CT \u2192 C\nZ\nZ\nF (\u03c9) \u03bd(d\u03c9) .\n(1.6)\nF (S\u03c9) \u03bd(d\u03c9) =\nCT\n\nCT\n\nThe weak correlation condition required in A3 is the subject of the following\nDefinition 1.1. A probability measure \u03bd on CT is said to be weakly correlated if\nthere exists some \u03ba \u2208 (0, 1] such that for any pair of vertices x 6= y, which are\ncommon forward neighbors of some vertex, and any pair of bounded measurable\nfunctions F, G : CT \u2192 [0, \u221e), one of which is determined by the values over the\nforward subtree Tx and the other determined by the values of over the forward\nsubtree Ty ,\nZ\nZ\nZ\nG(\u03c9) \u03bd(d\u03c9).\n(1.7)\nF (\u03c9) \u03bd(d\u03c9)\nF (\u03c9) G(\u03c9) \u03bd(d\u03c9) \u2265 \u03ba\nCT\n\nCT\n\nCT\n\nBy standard approximation arguments it suffices to test (1.7) for bounded continuous F , G.\nClearly, the collection of probability measures P on RT satisfying A1 and A3\nincludes the case where {\u03c9x }x\u2208T form iid random variables. Let us also note that\nif P is stationary and weakly correlated then P is ergodic. As a consequence, the\nac spectrum of H\u03bb (\u03c9) coincides with a deterministic set, cf. [9,24,16].\n1.3. Relation with previous results\nThe topic of Anderson (de)localization on tree graphs goes back to Abou-Chacra,\nAnderson and Thouless [1,2]. They noted that a \"self-consistent\" approach, which\nfor general graphs can be viewed as an approximation, is exact for Cayley trees and\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n5\n\nused it to explore the location of the mobility edge for small disorder. The subject\nwas further studied in [23,22]. In particular, Miller and Derrida [22] argued that for\nenergies within the spectrum of the unperturbed operator delocalized eigenfunctions should persist under weak disorder. For a summary of these findings see [16].\nThere have also been rigorous results on this topic. Localization, in the sense\nof existence of pure point spectrum, was proven at extreme energies, and at all\nenergies for large values of the disorder parameter \u03bb, see [3]. It was also shown in\n[4] that for small \u03bb and U = 0 the operator H\u03bb (\u03c9) has only pure point spectrum\nfor energies |E| > K + 1. It should be noted that this range does not include the\nfull resolvent set of the unperturbed operator, since\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c3(T ) = \u03c3ac (T ) = \u2212 2 K, 2 K .\n(1.8)\n\nConcerning delocalization, which is the subject of this note, Klein [16,18] established the stability of the ac spectrum in the case U = 0 and {\u03c9x }x\u2208T iid\nrandom variables.\nUsing supersymmetric representations he showed that for any\n\u221a\n0 < |E| < 2 K there exists \u03bb(E) > 0 such that\ni\nh\n2\n< \u221e.\n(1.9)\nsup\nsup sup E\n\u03b40 , (H\u03bb (*) \u2212 E \u2032 \u2212 i\u03b7)\u22121 \u03b40\n|\u03bb|<\u03bb(E) |E \u2032 |<E \u03b7>0\n\nIn particular, (1.9) implies that for small \u03bb the almost sure spectrum is purely ac\nin an energy range which is contained in \u03c3ac (T ) as shown in [18]. Moreover, the\nstates in this energy range exhibit super-ballistic-transport behavior [17].\n\nThe results presented here address issues similar to those discussed in [18]. We\ndo not pursue the question whether the ac spectrum is pure in the intervals under\nstudy. However, the approach we present is quite different from the technique used\nin the above mentioned works, and the result applies to more general situations.\n2. A criterion for the stability of the ac spectrum\nThe argument which proves our main result, Theorem 1.1, yields a continuity criterion of a somewhat greater generality. To present it, we shall frame the discussion in the context of radially stationary potentials. For this purpose, we let\n(\u039e, p) be a probability space on which there is measure preserving ergodic mapping S : \u039e \u2192 \u039e. Every measurable function u : \u039e \u2192 R generates through\nUx (\u03b8) = u(S |x| \u03b8),\nfor all x \u2208 T, \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e,\n(2.1)\na potential on the tree, which is radial and stationary under radial shifts. We will\nsubsequently refer to potentials U (\u03b8) of the form (2.1) as radially stationary and\nassume tacitly that the function u is log-integrable:\nZ\nlog(1 + |u(\u03b8)|) p(d\u03b8) < \u221e .\n(2.2)\n\u039e\n\nTo include the radially \u03c4 -periodic potentials in the above setup, one may take\n\u039e = {1, . . . , \u03c4\u0001 }, with p the equidistribution among the \u03c4 integers, and S the shift\nS\u03b8 := \u03b8 + 1 mod \u03c4 .\n\n\f6\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\n2.1. The stability criterion\nAny radially stationary potential gives rise to a radially stationary Schr\u00f6dinger\noperator\nH0 (\u03b8) := T + U (\u03b8)\non l2 (T).\n(2.3)\nSome basic facts on the spectral properties of such operators are collected in Appendix A. As a generalization of (1.1) we consider weak perturbations of such\noperators by a random potential, i.e.,\nH\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) := H0 (\u03b8) + \u03bbV (\u03c9)\n\non l2 (T).\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor the statement of our stability criterion it \u0001is important to note that there exists a\nBorel set \u03a3ac (0) \u2286 R such that \u03c3ac H0 (\u03b8) = \u03a3ac (0) for almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e, cf.\nProposition A.2. Moreover, due to ergodicity there exists a Borel set \u03a3ac (\u03bb) \u2286 R\nsuch that\n\u0001\n\u03c3ac H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) = \u03a3ac (\u03bb)\n(2.5)\nfor almost all (\u03b8, \u03c9).\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 1.1 a significant role will be played by considerations\nof functions \u0393 with Im \u0393 \u2265 0 satisfying the following co-cycle condition\n\u0393 (\u03b8) =\n\n1\n.\nU0 (\u03b8) \u2212 E \u2212 K \u0393 (S\u03b8)\n\n(2.6)\n\nIt provides an alternative formulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a covariant\neigenfunction. As will be discussed below, the co-cycle (2.6) has at least one solution with Im \u0393 \u2265 0 in the energy range \u03a3ac (0). Its uniqueness in case of radially\nperiodic U is proven in Proposition A.3 of Appendix A.\nDefinition 2.1. The Schr\u00f6dinger co-cycle (2.6) is said to admit a unique solution\nin an energy range I \u2282 R if for Lebesgue-almost all E \u2208 I there exists a unique\nmeasurable function \u0393 : \u039e \u2192 C satisfying (2.6) and Im \u0393 (\u03b8) \u2265 0 for almost\nevery \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e.\nAs is apparent from the argument, our proof of Theorem 1.1, establishes the\nfollowing somewhat more general statement.\nTheorem 2.1. Let U (\u03b8) be radially stationary for which the spectrum of H0 (\u03b8) has\nan absolutely continuous component, and let V (\u03c9) be a random potential satisfying A1, A2, and A3. Then a sufficient condition for the continuity of the ac spectrum of H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) in the sense expressed in Theorem 1.1, is that the Schr\u00f6dinger\nco-cycle (2.6) admits a unique solution in the energy range \u03a3ac (0).\nIt should be noted that if U (\u03b8) is non-deterministic then \u03a3ac (0) = \u2205 due to\nthe relation of \u03a3ac (0) to the ac spectrum of a one-dimensional operator discussed\nin Appendix A and Kotani theory [19,28]. Examples of deterministic potentials\nare periodic or almost-periodic ones. For a further comment on the latter case, see\nSection 7.\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n7\n\n2.2. Outline of the proof\nThe analysis on trees is often more accessible than on other graphs since various\nquantities computed at the tree root satisfy recursion relations. These relate the\nquantity at the root to the corresponding counterparts on the subtrees to which the\ntree breaks upon the removal of the root site. We make use of such a relation for\nthe diagonal elements of the forward resolvents:\nD\n\u0001\u22121 E\n\u0393x (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, \u03c9) := \u03b4x , H\u03bbTx (\u03b8, \u03c9) \u2212 z\n\u03b4x ,\n(2.7)\n\nwhere H\u03bbTx (\u03b8, \u03c9) is the restriction of the operator H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) to the Hilbert space\nl2 (Tx ) over the forward tree graph Tx \u2282 T. The above is well defined for any\nz \u2208 C+ := {z \u2208 C : Im z > 0}, and through the Herglotz property the limit\n\u0393x (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, \u03c9) := lim \u0393x (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9)\n\u03b7\u21930\n\n(2.8)\n\nexists for Lebesgue-almost every E \u2208 R, cf. Appendix B.\nThe forward resolvents play a diagnostic role for the problem considered here.\nIn particular, the density of the ac component of the spectral measure of H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9)\nassociated with \u03b40 \u2208 l2 (T) is given by \u03c0 \u22121 Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, \u03c9).\nIt is a significant observation that the above quantities also play another role.\nThe products yield the off-diagonal Green function [18, Eq. (2.8)],\n\u03b40 , (H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) \u2212 z)\u22121 \u03b4x =\n\n|x|\nY\n\n\u0393xj (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, \u03c9),\n\n(2.9)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere xj , with j = 0, . . . , |x|, denote the vertices along the unique path joining\nthe root 0 (=: x0 ) and x (=: x|x| ).\nFundamental to our discussion is the recursion relation which the forward resolvents are well know to satisfy [1,22,18,11]. For each \u03bb \u2208 R, z \u2208 C+ , \u03c9 \u2208 RT\nand at each vertex x \u2208 T, one has\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\nX\n\u0393x (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, \u03c9) = Ux (\u03b8) + \u03bbVx (\u03c9) \u2212 z \u2212\n\u0393y (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, \u03c9)\n,\n(2.10)\ny\u2208Nx+\n\nwhere Nx+ is the set of the forward neighbors of x. For \u03bb = 0 and E \u2208 R this\nrelation boils down to (2.6) due to covariance property\n\u0393x (0, z, \u03b8) = \u03930 (0, z, S |x| \u03b8) .\n\n(2.11)\n\nFor almost every E \u2208 \u03a3ac (0) one measurable solution of (2.6) with values in C+\nis thus provided by \u03930 (0, E+i0, \u03b8), the forward resolvent corresponding to H0 (\u03b8).\nThe issue in the additional assumption of Theorem 2.1 is therefore the uniqueness\nof this solution.\n\n\f8\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nThe main part of our analysis is to show that the forward resolvents converge\nin a certain distributional sense to their unperturbed counterparts. To do so, we first\nprove that their distribution is sharp in the sense that\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0393x (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9) = \u03a6x (E, \u03b8) 1 + ox (E, \u03b8, \u03c9; \u03bb, \u03b7)\n(2.12)\nwith some \u03a6x (E, \u03b8) which does not depend on \u03c9 and certain ox (E, \u03b8, \u03c9; \u03bb, \u03b7)\nwhich vanish in the distributional sense for \u03bb, \u03b7 \u2192 0.\n\nA key step in the derivation of (2.12) is the proof of the corresponding statement for just the imaginary part, Im \u0393x , where we suppress the dependence on\n(\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9). The starting point for this is the relation:\n!\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u03b7\n1 X\n2\n+ log\n(2.13)\n+\nIm \u0393y ,\nlog Im \u0393x = log K \u0393x\nK\nK\n+\ny\u2208Nx\n\nwhich follows from (2.10). The mean value of the first term on the right may be\nregarded as a Lyapunov exponent on the tree which vanishes at \u03bb, \u03b7 = 0 for most\nE \u2208 \u03a3ac (0). A relevant observation here is that while this term may exhibit a\nrather erratic dependence on \u03bb and E for \u03b7 = 0, its integrals over E form continuous functions of \u03bb, \u03b7.\nThe second term calls for an application of the Jensen inequality:\n!\n1 X\n1 X\nIm \u0393y \u2265\nlog Im \u0393y ,\n(2.14)\nlog\nK\nK\n+\n+\ny\u2208Nx\n\ny\u2208Nx\n\nwhere the inequality is strict unless Im \u0393y coincide for all y \u2208 Nx+ . Under the\nweak-correlation assumption A3, the above considerations lead to the conclusion\nthat the distributions of Im \u0393x are of vanishing relative width. This is quantified\nbelow through a more thorough discussion of that notion \u2013 on which we expand in\nAppendix D \u2013 and a strengthened version of the Jensen inequality.\nPutting the above arguments together we conclude the analog of (2.12) for\nIm \u0393x and use this to deduce the sharpness of the distribution of \u0393x itself. Finally, upon substituting (2.12) into the recursion relation (2.10), we conclude that\n\u03a6x (E, \u03b8) satisfies the same equation as \u0393x (0, E + i0, \u03b8). Since in its dependence\non x, \u03a6x (E, \u03b8) is radial and covariant, i.e., \u03a6x (E, \u03b8) = \u03a60 (E, S |x| \u03b8), our main\nresult follows from the uniqueness of solutions of (2.6).\n3. A Lyapunov exponent and its continuity\nWe shall refer to the following quantity as the Lyapunov exponent for the Schr\u00f6dinger operator (1.1) on the tree\nZ\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\u221a\np(d\u03b8) .\n(3.1)\n\u03b3\u03bb (z) := \u2212\nE log\nK \u03930 (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, *)\n\u039e\n\nBelow, we list some basic facts:\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n9\n\n1. The Lyapunov exponent \u03b3\u03bb (z) is a harmonic function of z \u2208 C+ as it is the\nnegative real part of the Herglotz function\nZ\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\u221a\nK \u03930 (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, *) p(d\u03b8) .\n(3.2)\nw\u03bb (z) :=\nE log\n\u039e\n\nAssumption A2 and Lemma B.2 ensure that w\u03bb (z) and \u03b3\u03bb (z) are well defined.\nMoreover, by the symmetry assumption A1, w\u03bb (z) remains unchanged if \u03930\nis replaced by \u0393x .\n2. In view of the relation (2.9), \u03b3\u03bb (z) describes the typical decay rate of the\nGreen's function along a ray, normalized so that in the absence of significant\nfluctuations between different branches \u03b3\u03bb (z) > 0 assures that the Green function is square integrable. The reader is cautioned, however, that in contrast to\none dimension, for random potentials on the tree the ac spectrum does not coincide with the essential closure of the set of energies on which this Lyapunov\nexponent vanishes. This issue is further discussed in Appendix C.\nSome of the properties of the Lyapunov exponent which are of immediate relevance for our discussion are summarized in the following statement.\nTheorem 3.1. Let U (\u03b8) be radially stationary, and V (\u03c9) satisfy A1 and A2. Then:\n1. The Lyapunov exponent is positive \u03b3\u03bb (z) > 0 for all z \u2208 C+ , and satisfies\nlim\n\n\u03b7\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7)\n= 0.\n\u03b7\n\n(3.3)\n\n2. For \u03bb = 0 the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the ac spectrum of H0 (\u03b8) =\nT + U (\u03b8):\n\u03b30 (E + i0) = 0\n(3.4)\nfor Lebesgue-almost every E \u2208 \u03a3ac (0).\nR\n3. For any bounded Borel set I \u2282 R the integral I \u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7) dE is continuous\nin (\u03bb, \u03b7) \u2208 R \u00d7 [0, \u221e).\n4. For any bounded Borel set I \u2286 \u03a3ac (0) one has\nZ\nlim\n\u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7) dE = 0.\n(3.5)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\u03b7\u21930\n\nI\n\nProof. 1. The positivity of \u03b3\u03bb on C+ can be seen through (2.13) and (2.14). The\nstatement about the asymptotics derives from (B.10) in Appendix B.\n2. The vanishing of \u03b30 on \u03a3ac (0) forms part of Proposition A.2 in Appendix A.\n3. As a positive harmonic function which satisfies the asymptotics (3.3), \u03b3\u03bb (* + i\u03b7)\nwith (\u03bb, \u03b7) \u2208 R \u00d7 [0, \u221e) can be represented as\nZ\nIm z\n\u03c3\n(dE) ,\n(3.6)\n\u03b3\u03bb (z + i\u03b7) =\n2 (\u03bb,\u03b7)\nR |E \u2212 z|\nR\nwhere the Borel measure \u03c3(\u03bb,\u03b7) is unique and satisfies R (E 2 + 1)\u22121 \u03c3(\u03bb,\u03b7) (dE) <\n\u221e, see [10]. Thanks to the Hergoltz property of w\u03bb , the harmonic conjugate of\n\n\f10\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\n\u03b3\u03bb (* + i\u03b7) = \u2212 Re w\u03bb (* + i\u03b7) has a definite sign and hence locally integrable\nboundary values [10, Thm. 1.1]. This implies that \u03c3(\u03bb,\u03b7) is purely ac [10, Thm. 3.1\n& Corollary 1], and for all (\u03bb, \u03b7) \u2208 R \u00d7 [0, \u221e), one has\nZ\n(3.7)\n\u03c3(\u03bb,\u03b7) (I) = \u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7) dE .\nI\n\nThe asserted continuity thus follows from the vague continuity of the measure\n\u03c3(\u03bb,\u03b7) in (\u03bb, \u03b7) \u2208 R \u00d7 [0, \u221e), see [7]. By Proposition 3.1 below, a sufficient\ncondition for the latter is the (pointwise) continuity of \u03b3\u03bb (z + i\u03b7) for all z \u2208 C+ .\nThis pointwise convergence follows from the (weak) resolvent convergence\nlim \u0393x (\u03bb\u2032 , z + i\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03b8, \u03c9) = \u0393x (\u03bb, z + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9)\n\n\u03bb\u2032 \u2192\u03bb\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192\u03b7\n\n(3.8)\n\nfor all Im z > 0 and all x \u2208 T, \u03bb \u2208 R, \u03b7 \u2208 [0, \u221e), \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e, \u03c9 \u2208 RT , together\nwith the dominated convergence theorem, which is applicable thanks to (B.10) of\nAppendix B.\n4.

Some useful observations about the composition laws for the\nrelative widths of sums and products of random variables are presented in Appendix D.\nWe shall now apply the above tools to show that the vanishing of the Lyapunov\nexponent implies the sharpness of the distributions of both Im \u0393x and |\u0393x |.\nTheorem 4.1.

The first is\n#\n\"\n\u0001\n1 X\n(4.10)\nlog Im \u0393y ,\nS1 := E\nK\n+\ny\u2208Nx\n\nwhich, upon averaging over \u03b8 and using A1, will cancel the first term on the right\nside of (4.9).

Using Lemma D.2 of\nAppendix D, we find\n\u0001\u00032\n\u03ba\u03b12 \u0002\nS2 \u2265\n\u03b4 Im \u0393y , \u03b1\n(4.12)\n4\n\nCombining the terms S1 and S2 , and averaging (4.9) over \u03b8, one arrives at (4.7).\nThe second assertion (4.8) follows from squaring the following inequality,\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4 Im \u0393x (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, *),\n\u0393x (\u03bb, z, \u03b8, *) , \u03b1 p(d\u03b8) \u2264 2\n\n\u03b1 \u0011\np(d\u03b8) ,\nK +1\n\u039e\n\u039e\n(4.13)\napplying the Jensen inequality, and inserting (4.7). For a proof of (4.13), we employ the recursion relation (2.10) and Lemma D.1, which for any p + q = 1 yields\n\u03b4\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u03b4 |\u0393x | , \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4 (Im \u0393x , p\u03b1) + \u03b4\n2\n\nX\n\ny\u2208Nx+\n\n!\n\nIm \u0393y , q\u03b1\n\n\u0010\nq\u03b1 \u0011\n.\n\u2264 \u03b4 (Im \u0393x , p\u03b1) + \u03b4 Im \u0393y ,\nK\n\n(4.14)\n\nIn the last inequality, we have used the fact that \u0393y is identical in distribution to\n\u0393y\u2032 for any y, y \u2032 \u2208 Nx+ . Setting p = (K + 1)\u22121 and averaging over \u03b8 completes\nthe proof of (4.13). \u2293\n\u2294\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n13\n\n5. Distributional convergence of the forward resolvents\nOur goal now is to establish that in a certain distributional sense, on which more\nis said below,\nD\n\n\u0393x (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9) \u2212\u2192 \u0393x (0, E + i0, \u03b8)\n\u03bb,\u03b7\u21920\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the quantity on the right side is a forward resolvent of H0 (\u03b8). The underlying reasoning for (5.1) is the observation that the fluctuation bounds of Theorem 4.1 and the information on the Lyapunov exponent in Theorem 3.1 imply that\nthe prelimit in (5.1) exhibits very weak dependence on \u03c9 for small \u03bb and \u03b7. At the\nsame time, those quantities satisfy a recursion relation which is close to (2.6). By\nassumption this equation has a unique solution taking values in C+ .\nThere are a number of gaps in the above narrative which need to be addressed\nin the proof:\n1. Concerning the Lyapunov exponent \u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7), it is only known that the integral over E tends to zero in the joint limit \u03bb, \u03b7 \u2192 0 \u2013 not that it tends to zero\non some set of energies E.\n2. The fluctuation bounds imply the narrowing of the distribution of |\u0393x | and\nIm \u0393x , however, the limiting value of \u0393x \u2208 C+ could range over two distinct\npoints.\n3. The narrowing in the distribution refers only to the dependence of \u0393x (\u03bb, E +\ni\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9) on \u03c9 at fixed \u03bb, \u03b7. That still leaves room for some rather erratic dependence on the parameters \u03bb, \u03b7.\n4. The uniqueness of the solution holds only for the limiting equation and within\nthe class of perfectly radial and covariant functions of |x|. However, we deal\nwith quantities which may still include additional randomness and for which\nthe symmetry holds only in the distributional sense.\nIn order to bypass the first-mentioned limitation, the convergence (5.1) is derived below in the distributional sense with respect to the joint dependence on\n(E, \u03c9). The latter are distributed by the product measure D := LI \u2297 P on I \u00d7 RT ,\nwhere LI is the Lebesgue measure restricted to I \u2286 \u03a3ac (0). In order to address\nthe joint values of the entire collection of variables, we regard (E, \u0393 ) as taking\nvalues in the product space I \u00d7 CT and consider the family of finite measures\n(\u03b8)\n\u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) induced on this space by the image of LI \u2297 P under the mapping\n\u0010 \b\n(E, \u03c9) 7\u2192 E, \u0393x (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9)\n\nx\u2208T\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e and (\u03bb, \u03b7) are indexing parameters with values in R \u00d7 (0, \u221e) or\n{(0, 0)}. These mappings and the corresponding measures are well-defined even\nalong the boundary \u03b7 = 0.\nIn the above terminology, we will establish the following\n\n\f14\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let U (\u03b8) be radially stationary, assume that the co-cycle (2.6) admits a unique solution on \u03a3ac (0), and let V (\u03c9) satisfy A1, A2 and A3. Moreover,\nlet I \u2286 \u03a3ac (0) be a bounded Borel set. Then the measures on I \u00d7 CT which describe the joint distribution of (E, \u0393 ) induced from LI \u2297 P by the mapping (5.2),\nsatisfy for almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e:\n(\u03b8)\n\n(\u03b8)\n\nlim \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) = \u03bc(0,0)\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u03bb\u21920\n\u03b7\u21930\n\nin the sense of weak convergence.\n(\u03b8)\n\nLet us note a number of elementary properties of the measures \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) and some\nrelated observations:\n(\u03b8)\n\n1. The limiting measure \u03bc(0,0) is concentrated on the graph of the function E 7\u2192\n\u0393 (0, E + i0, \u03b8) \u2208 CT . Accordingly, it has the product form\n(\u03b8)\n\n\u03bc(0,0) (dE d\u0393 ) = dE \u2297 \u03b4\u0393 (0,E+i0,\u03b8) (d\u0393 ).\n\n(5.4)\n\n(E,\u03b8)\n\n2. For almost every E \u2208 I the conditional measure \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) equals the image of\nthe probability measure P under the mapping \u03c9 7\u2192 \u0393 (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9) \u2208 CT .\n(E,\u03b8)\nSince \u03bc(0,0) is supported on \u0393 (0, E + i0, \u03b8), an equivalent way of stating the\nconclusion (5.3) is that the forward resolvents converge in distribution, i.e., for\nall x \u2208 T and almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e\nD\u2212lim \u0393x (\u03bb, * + i\u03b7, \u03b8, *) = \u0393x (0, * + i0, \u03b8)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\u03b7\u21930\n\n(5.5)\n\nwith D := LI \u2297 P, cf. Definition B.1 in Appendix B.\n(\u03b8)\n3. The family of measures \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) is tight [7,8]. This is readily deduced from:\ninf\n\nsup\n\nt>0 (\u03bb,\u03b7)\u2208R\u00d7[0,\u221e)\n\n\u0001\n(\u03b8)\n\u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) |\u0393x | > t = 0 ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nfor all x \u2208 T and \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e, which follows from Lemma B.1 in Appendix B.\n(\u03b8)\n4. The measures \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) are of constant mass, |I| < \u221e. For a family of such\nmeasures, tightness implies that any sequence has (possibly many) weak accumulation points [8,7]. In order to prove the claimed convergence (5.3) it\nsuffices to show that any accumulation point of the given sequence coincides\n(\u03b8)\nwith \u03bc(0,0) .\nWe shall follow the path indicated by the last observation. By focusing on the\n(\u03b8)\naccumulation points \u03bc(\u03b8) of \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) , we may take advantage of the fact that in the\njoint limit \u03bb, \u03b7 \u2192 0 various approximate statements which were outlined above\ntake sharp form. In particular, the recursion relation simplifies. For the latter, we\nshall make use of the following general principle.\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n15\n\nProposition 5.1. Let (\u03bd\u03b2 )\u03b2\u2208J be a family of finite measures on a polish space \u03a5 ,\nindexed by \u03b2 which takes values in a topological space J.

The integral in (5.9) may be rewritten as\nZ\nZ\n\u03c8(\u03b20 , Y ) \u03bd(dY ) \u2264 \u03c8(\u03b2, Y ) \u03bd\u03b2 (dY ) + sup \u03c8(\u03b2, Y ) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b20 , Y ) \u03bd\u03b2 (K)\nY \u2208K\nK\nK\nZ\n\u0001\n+\n\u03c8(\u03b20 , Y ) \u03bd(dY ) \u2212 \u03bd\u03b2 (dY ) .\n(5.10)\nK\n\nNow, under the assumption (5.7) the first term vanishes for every \u03b2, and the conditions i) and ii) imply that the second and third term vanish in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b20 .\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\nWe now have the following characterization of the possible accumulation points\ndiscussed above.\nLemma 5.1.

The first part is a consequence of Proposition 5.1. To apply it, we let \u03b2\ndenote the pair (\u03bb, \u03b7), with J a neighborhood of \u03b20 := (0, 0) in R \u00d7 (0, \u221e) \u222a\n{(0, 0)}. For \u03a5 we choose I \u00d7 CT \u00d7 RT endowed with the product topology. The\nmeasures \u03bd(\u03bb,\u03b7) are defined as the image of LI \u2297 P under the mapping\n\u0001\n\u0001\nE, \u03c9 7\u2192 E, \u0393 (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c9), V (\u03c9) ,\n(5.14)\n(\u03b8)\n\nso that \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) coincides with the projection of \u03bd(\u03bb,\u03b7) onto the first coordinates\n(E, \u0393 ). Finally, we set\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c6 (\u03bb, \u03b7), E, \u0393, V := 1 \u2212 Ux (\u03b8) + \u03bb Vx \u2212 E \u2212 i\u03b7 \u2212\n\u0393y \u0393x , (5.15)\ny\u2208Nx+\n\n\u0001\nso that the recursion relation (2.10) can be expressed as \u03c6 (\u03bb, \u03b7), E, \u0393, V = 0.\n2. We first note that (5.11) implies that there exists a set J \u2286 I of full Lebesgue\nmeasure and a subsequence {(\u03bbk , \u03b7k )}\u221e\nk=0 of the original sequence such that\n(E,\u03b8)\n\nlim \u03bc(\u03bbk ,\u03b7k ) = \u03bc(E,\u03b8)\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(5.16)\n\nfor all E \u2208 J.\n(a) The weak correlation property is inherited by weak limits, since it suffices to\nto verify (1.7) for bounded continuous functions F and G.

Lemma D.4 in Appendix D and (5.16) thus imply that for\nLebesgue-almost all E \u2208 I both Im \u0393x and |\u0393x | are \u03bc(E,\u03b8) -almost surely constant.\nNote that by (5.12), \u0393x 6= 0 \u03bc(E,\u03b8) -almost surely. \u2293\n\u2294\nSince a line and a circle can intersect in at most two points, Eq.

By (5.13) in Lemma 5.1 there exists at most two points \u03a6\u00b1\nx (E, \u03b8) \u2208\n+\n\u2212\nC\\{0} with Im \u03a6\u00b1\n(E,\n\u03b8)\n\u2265\n0\nsuch\nthat\n\u0393\n\u2208\n{\u03a6\n(E,\n\u03b8),\n\u03a6\n(E,\n\u03b8)}\nfor \u03bc(E,\u03b8) x\nx\nx\nx\nalmost all \u0393 . We will now prove by contradiction that these two points coincide at\nevery x \u2208 T.\n\u2212\nAssume that there exists some y \u2208 Nx+ for which \u03a6+\ny (E, \u03b8) 6= \u03a6y (E, \u03b8).\nSince \u03bc(E,\u03b8) is weakly correlated, we have\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\\ \u0010\nY\n(E,\u03b8)\n\u00b1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc(E,\u03b8) \u0393y = \u03a6\u00b1\n\u2265\u03ba\n\u0393y = \u03a6y (E, \u03b8)\ny (E, \u03b8) > 0,\ny\u2208Nx+\n\ny\u2208Nx+\n\n(5.20)\n\u2212\n\u2032\n=\n\u03a6\n(E,\n\u03b8)\nfor\nall\ny\n=\n6\ny\u2032 \u2208\nand similarly \u03bc(E,\u03b8) \u0393y = \u03a6+\n(E,\n\u03b8)\nand\n\u0393\ny\ny\ny\n\u0001\nP\nNx+ > 0, which implies that the image measure of \u0393 7\u2192 Ux \u2212 E \u2212 y\u2208Nx+ \u0393y\ninduced on C by \u03bc(E,\u03b8) contains at least 3 points in its support. This is however not\nconsistent with the limiting recursion relation (5.12) since the measure induced on\nC by \u0393x\u22121 , which is equal to one described above, is supported on only two points.\n(E,\u03b8)\n\n2. This property follows from the invariance of \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7) under exchange of variables\non disjoint forward subtrees and its covariance under radial shifts.\n3. For almost all E \u2208 I the function \u03b8 \u2192 \u03a60 (E, \u03b8) is for almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e a\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger co-cycle (2.6) with Im \u03a60 (E, \u03b8) \u2265 0. It therefore coincides with \u03930 (0, E + i0, \u03b8) by the uniqueness assumption (which is verified in\nAppendix A for the periodic case). \u2293\n\u2294\nWe are now ready to conclude the\nProof (of Theorem 5.1). In order to prove the convergence asserted in (5.3), it\n(\u03b8)\nsuffices to establish uniqueness of the accumulation point for the measures \u03bc(\u03bb,\u03b7)\nwith \u03bb \u2192 0 and \u03b7 \u2193 0. That was done in the argument which culminated in\nLemma 5.2, which shows that for almost every \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e any such point coincides\n(\u03b8)\n\u2294\nwith \u03bc(0,0) . \u2293\n6. Proof of the main result\nThe main results of this paper, Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 2.1, are a consequence\nof the convergence statements derived in the previous section. They culminate in\nthe following\n\n\f18\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nTheorem 6.1. Let U (\u03b8) be radially stationary, assume that the co-cycle (2.6) admits a unique solution on \u03a3ac (0), and let V (\u03c9) satisfy A1, A2 and A3. Moreover,\nlet I \u2286 \u03a3ac (0) be a bounded Borel set. Then for almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u039e:\n1. The boundary values of the forward resolvents of H\u03bb (\u03b8, \u03c9) = T + U (\u03b8) +\n\u03bbV (\u03c9) converge in distribution,\nD\u2212lim \u0393x (\u03bb, * + i0, \u03b8, *) = \u0393x (0, * + i0, \u03b8)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n(6.1)\n\nfor all x \u2208 T, where D = LI \u2297 P.\n2. If additionally I is closed and \u03c3ac (H0 (\u03b8)) \u2229 I = \u03c3(H0 (\u03b8)) \u2229 I, then the density of the ac component of the spectral measure associated with the forward\nresolvents are L1 -continuous at \u03bb = 0 the sense that\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nlim E Im \u0393x (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8) \u2212 Im \u0393x (0, E + i0, \u03b8) dE = 0 (6.2)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nI\n\nfor all x \u2208 T.\n\nProof. 1. For a proof of (6.1) we let \u03b5 > 0 and use Fatou's lemma\n\u0011\n\u0010\nLI \u2297 P \u0393x (\u03bb, * + i0, \u03b8, *) \u2212 \u0393x (0, * + i0, \u03b8) > \u03b5\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2264 lim inf LI \u2297 P \u0393x (\u03bb, * + i\u03b7, \u03b8, *) \u2212 \u0393x (0, * + i0, \u03b8) > \u03b5 < \u221e .\n\u03b7\u21930\n\n(6.3)\n\nWe now take the limit \u03bb \u2192 0. Since (5.5) holds for any joint sequence of (\u03bb, \u03b7) in\nR \u00d7 (0, \u221e), the right side of (6.3) converges to zero in this limit.\n2. Eq. (6.2) follows from (6.1) with the help of Proposition B.2 in Appendix B.\nTo verify its assumptions we note that the resolvent convergence (3.8) implies the\nweak convergence lim\u03bb\u21920 \u03bd\u03bbx (\u03b8, \u03c9) = \u03bd0x (\u03b8) of the spectral measures associated\nwith \u0393x , see (B.2) and [26, Thm. VIII.24]. Moreover, since the spectrum of H0 (\u03b8)\non I is purely ac, the spectral measures \u03bd00 (\u03b8) and hence \u03bd0x (\u03b8) for all x \u2208 T are\nalso purely ac on I, cf. Appendix A. \u2293\n\u2294\nThe main result now follows from the special case x = 0 in the above the theorem.\nProof (of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 2.1). The two statements can be proven simultaneously, as the only difference in the argument is that in the general case\nof Theorem 2.1 the uniqueness of solutions of (2.6) is among the assumptions,\nwhereas for the more specific case of Theorem 1.1 this is established in Proposition A.3 of Appendix A.\n1. By the non-randomness of the spectrum, it suffices to show that for any I \u2286\n\u03a3ac (0) and almost all \u03b8\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\nlim E LI \u03c3ac (H\u03bb (\u03b8, *)) = LI I .\n(6.4)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nWe start the proof of this relation by observing that\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\nLI I \u2265 E LI \u03c3ac (H\u03bb (\u03b8, *))\n\b\n\u2265 LI \u2297 P 0 < Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, \u03c9) < \u221e .\n\n(6.5)\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n19\n\nFor any \u03b5 > 0 the set on the right side includes the collection of (E, \u03c9) for which\n\u03b5 < Im \u03930 (0, E+i0, \u03b8) < \u221e and Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E+i0, \u03b8, \u03c9)\u2212Im \u03930 (0, E+i0, \u03b8) \u2264\n\u03b5. Accordingly, the right side of (6.5) is bounded below by the difference of\n\b\n(6.6)\nLI \u2297 P Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, \u03c9) \u2212 Im \u03930 (0, E + i0, \u03b8) \u2264 \u03b5\nand\n\n\b\nLI Im \u03930 (0, E + i0, \u03b8) \u2208 [0, \u03b5] \u222a {\u221e} .\n\n(6.7)\n\nAs \u03bb \u2192 0 the measure in (6.6) converges to LI (I) for almost all \u03b8 by Theorem 6.1.\nMoreover, as \u03b5 \u2193 0 the measure in (6.7) converges to zero for almost all \u03b8.\n2. This assertion coincides with (6.2) in the special case x = 0. \u2293\n\u2294\n7. Discussion\nIn what follows below, we include some additional comments on possible extensions of the results presented in this work.\n1. The Green function at sites other than the root. Our discussion focused on the\nspectral measures associated with the vector \u03b40 \u2208 l2 (T), the vector at the root.\nTheorem 1.1 may, however, be extended to other sites on the tree graph, i.e., \u03b40\nmay be replaced by \u03b4x in (1.5). For a proof, it is useful to make the following observation. In order to study the Green function at x 6= 0 one may start from the\ncollection of the forward resolvents of the \"siblings\" of x, i.e., {\u0393y }|y|=|x|, which\nare then used as the input for a finite number of iterations of the suitably adjusted\nalgebraic recursion relation (2.10). Similarly, the statement can also be concluded\nfor the fully symmetric tree, for which the root has K + 1, rather than K forward\nneighbors (whose forward trees are then of the kind discussed here).\n2. Trees with non-constant branching. The arguments presented here may easily\nbe extended to trees where the branching numbers {Kx }x\u2208T are non-constant but\nperiodic functions of |x|. For this case, the analysis applies with only the natural\nadjustments.\n3. Almost periodic background operators. The stability criterion expressed in Theorem 2.1 may be applied to radial operators with quasi-periodic potentials, for\nexample with H0 (\u03b8) the almost-Mathieu operator [15]. Such operators may exhibit both pure point and ac spectra in one dimension, and by Proposition A.1\nalso on trees. The application of our analysis to such cases requires to verify the\nuniqueness of covariant solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger co-cycle (2.6). This question\nis addressed in a subsequent publication [5].\n4. Location of the mobility edge. We note that there is a gap between the results which address the possible location of pure point and ac spectrum for operators with weak disorder. For H\u03bb (\u03c9) = T + V (\u03c9) the results of [18] as well\nas this work\n\u221a show that the location of the mobility edge for for \u03bb small is at\n|E| \u2265 2 K. Conversely, it is only known [4] that the mobility edge approaches\n\n\f20\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nenergies |E| \u2264 K + 1. The limiting value of the mobility edge is still unresolved.\nThe current guess is that it is the result of [4] which needs to be improved (we\nthank Y. Last for an illuminating discussion of this point).\n\nAppendix\nA. Schr\u00f6dinger operators on tree graphs with radial potentials\nIn this appendix we provide some further details on the notions used in the paper\nand gather a few facts about the radial background operators considered in the\nmain text.\nA.1. Radial Schr\u00f6dinger operators\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger operator H = T +U on l2 (T) is said to be radial if the potential U\nis multiplication by a real-valued function {Ux }x\u2208T which has the radial symmetry\nof T, i.e.,\nUx = Uy\nfor all x, y \u2208 T with |x| = |y|.\n(A.1)\n\nThe spectra of radial H are related to those of the corresponding half-line\noperators.\nProposition A.1. For any radial U the spectra of the operator H = T + U on\nl2 (T) and\nH + = T + K \u22121/2 U\non l2 (N0 )\n(A.2)\nsatisfy\n\u03c3(H) \u2287\n\n\u221a\nK \u03c3(H + ),\n\n\u03c3ac (H) =\n\n\u221a\n\nK \u03c3ac (H + ).\n\n(A.3)\n\nProof. The action of H on l2 (T) leaves invariant the subspace Hrad of the radially\nsymmetric\nfunctions. Under the partial isometry U : Hrad \u2192 l2 (N0 ), defined by\n\u0001\nU \u03c8 x = K |x|/2 \u03c8|x| , the restriction of H to this subspace is unitarily equivalent\n\u221a\nto H + . Hence \u03c3(H) \u2287 K \u03c3(H + ), and analogously for the ac spectrum.\nUnder the action of H, \u03b40 is a cyclic vector for\n\u221a the symmetric subspace Hrad .\nTherefore, to conclude the equality \u03c3ac (H) = K \u03c3ac (H + ) it suffices to show\nthat the support of the ac component of the spectral measure associated with an\narbitrary site x \u2208 T coincides with that of the root. The former is concentrated on\nthe set of energies E \u2208 R for which\n\u22121\n\n0 < Im \u03b4x , (H \u2212 E \u2212 i0)\n\n\u03b4x < \u221e ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nand the latter on the set of energies where\n0 < Im \u03930 (E + i0) < \u221e\n\n(A.5)\n\nWe claim that (A.4) implies 0 < Im \u0393y (E + i0) < \u221e for all y with |y| =\n|x| + 1. The reasoning involves the radial symmetry, by which \u0393x depends only\non |x|, and the recursion relation. Furthermore, through the recursion relation (A.6)\nbelow this leads to (A.5). \u2293\n\u2294\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n21\n\nAn alternative way to see the above unitary equivalence proceeds as follows.\nSince U is radial, each forward resolvent \u0393x associated with H depends only on\n|x|. With a slight abuse of notation, we will let {\u0393n }n\u2208N0 stand for the values of\nthe forward resolvents along one ray in the tree. Using an analogous convention\nfor U , the recursion relation (2.10) can be rewritten as\n\u0393n =\n\n1\nUn \u2212 z \u2212 K\u0393n+1\n\nfor all n \u2208 N0 .\n\n(A.6)\n\nWith suitable scaling, the recursion relation (A.6) is satisfied by both the forward\nresolvent of H and that of H + . As discussed in [11], this relation has a unique\nsolution for Im z > 0.\nA.2. Radially stationary Schr\u00f6dinger operators\nA special case of radial Schr\u00f6dinger operators are radially stationary ones with\npotential U (\u03b8) defined in (2.1) of Section 2. The following proposition compiles\nsome basic properties of such operators.\nProposition A.2. For any radially stationary U (\u03b8) the ac spectrum of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator H(\u03b8) = T + U (\u03b8) on l2 (T) has the properties:\n1. It is related to the ac spectrum of\n\nfor almost all \u03b8,\n\nb\nH(\u03b8)\n:= T + K \u22121/2 U (\u03b8)\n\non l2 (Z)\n\n\u0001 \u221a\n\u0001\nb\n\u03c3ac H(\u03b8) = K \u03c3ac H(\u03b8)\n.\n\n2. It can be characterized for almost all \u03b8 by\n\u0001\ness\n\u03c3ac H(\u03b8) = {E \u2208 R : \u03b30 (E + i0) = 0}\nwhere (*)\n\ness\n\ndenotes the Lebesgue-essential closure and\nZ\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n\u03b30 (z) =\nlog\nK \u03930 (0, z, \u03b8) p(d\u03b8)\n\n(A.7)\n(A.8)\n\n(A.9)\n\n(A.10)\n\n\u039e\n\nstands for the Lyapunov exponent, cf. (3.1).\nProof. 1. The first assertion is a consequence of Proposition A.1 and Kotani\u0001theory [19,28] which in particular ensures that for almost all \u03b8, \u03c3ac H + (\u03b8) =\n\u0001\nb\nwhere H + (\u03b8) acts on l2 (N0 ).\n\u03c3ac H(\u03b8)\n2. The second assertion follows from (A.8) and again Kotani theory [19,28]. \u2293\n\u2294\nLet us note that the disappearance of the ac spectrum under arbitrarily weak\nrandom perturbations, which was claimed in Proposition 1.1, is implied by Proposition A.2 and well-known results about random Schr\u00f6dinger operators in one dimension [9,24].\n\n\f22\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nA.3. The radial periodic case\nThe radially periodic potentials U fit into the framework of radially sationary\nones: we choose the equidistribution p on \u03c4 integers \u039e = {1, . . . , \u03c4 } on which\nS\u03b8 = (\u03b8 + 1) mod \u03c4 acts as a periodic shift.\nIn this case the covariant form (2.6) of the recursion relation takes the form of\na fixed point equation. More precisely, introducing the family of M\u00f6bius transfor\u0001\u22121\nmations T (E, \u03b8)(\u0393 ) := u(\u03b8) \u2212 E \u2212 K\u0393\nand iterating over a period \u03c4 , we\nobtain\n\u0001\n\u0393 (\u03b8) = T (E, \u03b8) * * * T (E, S \u03c4 \u22121 \u03b8) \u0393 (\u03b8)\n\u0001\na(E, \u03b8) \u0393 (\u03b8) + b(E, \u03b8)\n.\n(A.11)\n=: S(E, \u03b8) \u0393 (\u03b8) =:\nc(E, \u03b8) \u0393 (\u03b8) + d(E, \u03b8)\n\nHere we used the fact that any composition of real M\u00f6bius transformations is a\nM\u00f6bius transformations with some coefficients a(E, \u03b8), b(E, \u03b8), c(E, \u03b8), d(E, \u03b8) \u2208\nR.\nLemma A.1. For all, but a finite set of E \u2208 R, the fixed point equation (A.11) has\neither two non-real, complex-conjugate solutions or two real solutions.\nProof. The lemma is an immediate consequences of the following observations:\ni) the coefficients a(E, \u03b8), b(E, \u03b8), c(E, \u03b8), d(E, \u03b8) are polynomials in E of degree at most \u03c4 .\nii) if c(E, \u03b8) 6= 0 for all \u03b8 \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03c4 }, then (A.11) has one or two solutions in\nC, depending on the value of the discriminant\n\u00012\n\u033a(E) := Tr S(E, \u03b8) \u2212 4 det S(E, \u03b8)\n\u00012\n= a(E, \u03b8) \u2212 d(E, \u03b8) \u2212 4b(E, \u03b8)c(E, \u03b8) ,\n(A.12)\nwhich does not depend on \u03b8 for all E.\n\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nThe following proposition collects some facts about radially periodic Schr\u00f6dinger operators. It includes a proof of the first statement in Proposition 1.1 and\nverifies that the co-cycle (2.6) admits a unique solution on \u03a3ac (0) in the periodic\ncase.\nProposition A.3. Let U be radially periodic. Then the ac spectrum of the operator\nH = T + U on l2 (T) is a union of intervals. In particular,\n\u03c3ac (H) = {E \u2208 R : \u033a(E) < 0},\n\n(A.13)\n\nand therefore, for all but finitely many E \u2208 \u03c3ac (H), the fixed point equation (A.11)\nhas two non-real, complex-conjugate solutions.\nProof. As was noted in Proposition A.1, the ac spectrum of H is concentrated on\nthose energies E for which (A.4), and therefore (A.5), holds. For such energies,\n\u033a(E) < 0. If \u033a(E) < 0, it is clear that E \u2208 \u03c3ac (H). This proves (A.13). As \u033a is\na polynomial in E, one has that the ac spectrum of H is a union of intervals, and\naway from those energies for which \u033a(E) = 0, the fixed point equation (A.11) has\ntwo non-real, complex-conjugate solutions. \u2293\n\u2294\n\n\fStability of the Absolutely Continuous Spectrum\n\n23\n\nB.

More information on this subject can be found in [10,27] or [20,\n\u00a7 7], [9], and [24, App. A].\nProposition B.1. Let F be the Stieltjes transform of a finite Borel measure \u03bd on R.\n1.

The following proposition establishes\nthe equivalence of different notions of convergence of the ac spectral densities of\nsuch measures. We take the opportunity to first recall\n\n\f24\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nDefinition B.1. A sequence of measurable functions (fn )\u221e\nn=1 on I \u00d7 \u03a9 is said to\nconverge to f in LI \u2297 P-measure if\n\u0001\nlim LI \u2297 P |fn (E, \u03c9) \u2212 f (E, \u03c9)| > \u03b5 = 0\n(B.4)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor every \u03b5 > 0. We write: LI \u2297 P \u2212limn\u2192\u221e fn = f .\n\nIt is fairly easy to see that L1 -convergence implies convergence in measure [7]. In\nthe following we give a sufficient condition for the converse in our special setting.\nProposition B.2. Let (Fn (\u03c9))\u221e\nn=1 , F (\u03c9) be Stieltjes transforms of finite random\nBorel measures (\u03bdn (\u03c9))\u221e\nn=1 , \u03bd(\u03c9) on R. Assume that there exists some closed\nBorel set I \u2282 R such that for almost every \u03c9\ni) lim \u03bdn (\u03c9) = \u03bd(\u03c9) in the sense of weak convergence on I, and\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nii) \u03bd(\u03c9) is purely ac on I.\nThen the convergence of the ac densities in LI \u2297 P-measure,\nLI \u2297 P \u2212 lim Im Fn ( * + i0, *) = Im F ( * + i0, *),\n\n(B.5)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nimplies their L1 -convergence\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nlim\nE Im Fn (E + i0, *) \u2212 Im F (E + i0, *) dE = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(B.6)\n\nI\n\nProof. Every subsequence of (Im Fn )\u221e\nn=1 has a subsequence Im Fnk\nwhich\nlim Im Fnk (E + i0, \u03c9) = Im F (E + i0, \u03c9)\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0001\u221e\n\nk=1\n\nfor\n\n(B.7)\n\nfor LI \u2297 P-almost all (E, \u03c9) \u2208 I \u00d7 \u03a9.

Moreover,\nZ\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\nlim sup E [Im Fn (E + i0, *)] dE \u2264 \u03c0 lim sup E \u03bdn I = \u03c0 E \u03bd I\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\nI\nZ\n= E [Im F (E + i0, *)] dE.\n(B.8)\nI\n\nHere the first equality is a consequence of i) and ii), cf.

(B.6) now follows for subsequences fulfilling (B.7)\nfrom Fatou's lemma with remainder [21]. This completes the proof since every\nsubsequence has a subsequence for which (B.6) holds. \u2293\n\u2294\nIn the remainder of this appendix we collect more specialized bounds on the\nforward resolvents (B.2).

Extension of a result by Kotani and Simon\nFor one-dimensional random Schr\u00f6dinger operators, it is known [9,24] that the ac\nspectrum can be characterized by the essential closure of the set of energies for\nwhich the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. This result has two parts. Ishii [14] and\nPastur [25,24] showed that the positivity of the Lyapunov exponent implies the\nvanishing of the ac spectrum. Their result does not extend to trees as is illustrated\nby the following two examples:\nSuppose U = 0 and recall from (1.8) that the spectrum of T on l2 (T) is purely\nac.\n1. If {\u03c9x }x\u2208T are iid Cauchy variables with\nZ\ndv\n1\nwith some \u03c3 > 0 and all Borel A \u2282 R,\nP (\u03c9x \u2208 A) =\n\u03c0 A v2 + \u03c32\nthen Theorem 1.1 shows that for sufficiently small \u03bb > 0 and almost surely the\nspectrum of H\u03bb (\u03c9) = T + \u03bbV (\u03c9) has an ac component within its spectrum.\n\n\f26\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\n2. If V (\u03c9) is radial, i.e., given by Vx (\u03c9) = \u03c9|x|, where {\u03c9n }n\u2208N0 are iid Cauchy\nvariables as in 1, then by Proposition 1.1, for all \u03bb > 0 and almost every \u03c9 the\nspectrum of H\u03bb (\u03c9) = T + \u03bbV (\u03c9) has no ac component.\nIn both cases, the Lyapunov exponents are identical. In fact, a contour-integration\nargument shows that\n\u03b3\u03bb (E) = \u2212 log\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\nK \u03930 (0, E + i\u03bb\u03c3)\n\n\u0011\n\n>0\n\n(C.1)\n\nfor every E \u2208 \u03c3(T ) and all \u03bb > 0. Here the positivity follows from the explicit\nexpression for \u03930 (0, z).\nThe converse of the Ishii-Pastur result is due to Kotani [19], who showed that\nfor one-dimensional, continuum random Schr\u00f6dinger operators, zero Lyapunov\nexponent on some Borel set of positive measure implies the existence of ac spectrum there. Shortly thereafter, Simon demonstrated that an analogous result holds\nin the discrete setting [28]. This result partially extends to trees.\nTheorem C.1. Let U (\u03b8) be radially stationary and V (\u03c9) satisfy A1\u2013A3. Let \u03bb \u2208\nR and suppose I \u2282 R is an open interval for which \u03b3\u03bb (E + i0) = 0 for almost\nevery E \u2208 I. Then, \u03a3ac (\u03bb) \u2229 I 6= \u2205 .\nProof. We use a slight variation of the argument in [28]. Since Re w\u03bb (E + i0) =\n0 for almost all E \u2208 I, the Schwartz-reflection principle [27] (see also [20,\nLemma 7.5]) ensures that the function w\u03bb defined in (3.2) has an analytic continuation through I in the lower half-plane. In particular, this implies that its derivative\nexists through E \u2208 I and one has\nlim\n\u03b7\u21930\n\nd\u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7)\n\u03b3\u03bb (E + i\u03b7)\n= lim\n< \u221e.\n\u03b7\u21930\n\u03b7\nd\u03b7\n\n(C.2)\n\nUsing Fatou and Lemma C.1 below, one sees that\nZ\n\ni\nh\nE (Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, *))\u22121 p(d\u03b8)\n\u039e\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0010\nZ\n\u03b7 \u0011\u22121\n\u2264 lim inf\np(d\u03b8) < \u221e,\nE Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i\u03b7, \u03b8, *) +\n\u03b7\u21930\n2K\n\u039e\n\n(C.3)\n\nand therefore, Im \u03930 (\u03bb, E + i0, \u03b8, \u03c9) > 0 for almost every E \u2208 I and \u03b8, \u03c9. \u2293\n\u2294\nThe proof of the previous theorem relied on the following\nLemma C.1.

On relative errors\nThroughout this appendix let (\u03a9, P) be some probability space and X stand for a\npositive random variable. Our main object of interest is the relative width \u03b4(X, *)\nassociated with the distribution of X, which was introduced in Definition 4.1.\nThe following lemma collects some useful rules of calculus associated with\naddition, multiplication and division of positive random variables.\nLemma D.1.

Assertion 1 follows from the fact that \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03be\u2213 (X, \u03b1) is monotone increasing/decreasing respectively. A proof of assertion 2 is based on the identity\n\u03be\u00b1 (\u03b7 + X, \u03b1) = \u03b7 + \u03be\u00b1 (X, \u03b1) which yields\n\u03b4(\u03b7 + X, \u03b1) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03b7 + \u03be\u2212 (X, \u03b1)\n\u2264 \u03b4(X, \u03b1)\n\u03b7 + \u03be+ (X, \u03b1)\n\n(D.1)\n\n\f28\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nby monotonicity in \u03b7 \u2265 0.

By its definition, \u03be+ (\u03bd, \u03b1) is the smallest real number \u03be \u2208 R such that\n\u03bd[\u03be \u2212 \u03b5, \u221e) > \u03b1 for any \u03b5 > 0, and it suffices to restrict here the attention to\n\u03b5 for which \u03bd{\u03be \u2212 \u03b5} = 0. For such, we may deduce that for large enough n\nalso: \u03bdn [\u03be \u2212 \u03b5, \u221e) > \u03b1, and hence \u03be+ (\u03bdn , \u03b1) \u2265 \u03be \u2212 \u03b5. From this we conclude\nthat \u03be+ (\u03bd, \u03b1) \u2264 lim inf n\u2192\u221e \u03be+ (\u03bdn , \u03b1) and, by analogous reasoning, \u03be\u2212 (\u03bd, \u03b1) \u2265\nlim supn\u2192\u221e \u03be\u2212 (\u03bdn , \u03b1).\nFor a proof of the second assertion we distinguish two cases. If \u03be+ (\u03bd, \u03b1) = 0\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2], then \u03bd{0} = 1, because \u03bd is supported on [0, \u221e). Otherwise, if \u03be+ (\u03bd, \u03b1) > 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2], then \u03b4(\u03bd, \u03b1) = 1 \u2212 \u03be\u2212 (\u03bd, \u03b1)/\u03be+ (\u03bd, \u03b1)\nis well-defined and (D.9) implies\n\u03b4(\u03bd, \u03b1) \u2264 lim inf \u03b4(\u03bdn , \u03b1) .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(D.11)\n\nThe claims now readily follow as, in this case, zero relative width implies zero\nabsolute width. \u2293\n\u2294\nIn the main text, we need the following consequence of the preceding lemma.\n\n\f30\n\nAizenman, Sims, and Warzel\n\nLemma D.4. Let (T, \u03c1) be a finite measure space and {\u03bdnt }\u221e\nn=1 be a measurable\nfamily of sequences of probability measures on (0, \u221e) which are indexed by t \u2208 T .\nAssume that limn\u2192\u221e \u03bdnt = \u03bd t as a weak limit for almost all t \u2208 T . Suppose\nfurther that\nZ\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nT\n\n\u03b4(\u03bdnt , \u03b1) \u03c1(dt) = 0\n\n(D.12)\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2]. Then for almost all t \u2208 T there exists \u03be t \u2208 [0, \u221e) such that\n\u03bd t is supported on \u03be t .\nProof. From (D.12) we conclude that there exists some set S \u2286 T of full \u03c1 measure and some subsequence {\u03bdnt k }\u221e\nk=1 such that\nlim \u03b4(\u03bdnt k , \u03b1) = 0\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(D.13)\n\nfor all t \u2208 S and all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2] \u2229 Q. Since the weak convergence also holds\ndown the subsequence, i.e., limk\u2192\u221e \u03bdnt k = \u03bd t at almost every t, the claim follows\nfrom Lemma D.3. \u2293\n\u2294\nAcknowledgements.
