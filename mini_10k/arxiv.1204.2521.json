In this context the AdS/CFT correspondence has led to crucial insights by providing a novel way to probe the non-perturbative\naspects of these theories. While stacks of D-branes in string theory have turned out to be\nreasonably straightforward to model, the analogous case of stacks of M2 and M5-branes\nin M-theory have turned out to be much more difficult. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence the physics of a stack of M2-branes should be captured, to leading order, by\neleven dimensional supergravity in the near-horizon limit of the stack, i.e. on the space\nAdS4 \u00d7 S 7 . In the dual picture, there should be a CFT describing the multiple M2-brane\nphysics living on the boundary of AdS4 which realises all the bulk symmetries.\nA Chern-Simons (CS) matter theory [1] satisfying these requirements, i.e. having superconformal N = 8 symmetry and SO(8) R-symmetry, was found by Bagger and Lambert\n[2, 3] and Gustavsson [4] (BLG). At the classical level the theory has a unique gauge group,\nSO(4) = SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2), which indicates an interpretation of the theory as describing two\nM2-branes. Subsequently, a lot of progress has been made by considering theories that have\nonly N = 6 superconformal symmetry manifestly realised [5] then providing a description\nfor stacks with any number branes. However, this work and more recent results show that\nthe N = 8 theory can be generalised at the quantum level to describe any number of\nM2-branes, see e.g. [6] and references therein. This also includes a better understanding of\nthe U (1) factor related to the centre of mass.\nAn important ingredient in the AdS/CFT correspondence is the kind of boundary\nconditions that are imposed in the variational problem relating the bulk and boundary\ntheories. The predominant boundary condition used is the Dirichlet one, where the variations on the boundary are required to vanish. This leads to CFTs in a fixed geometry, the\nBLG theory being one example of this. In this paper we will follow the ideas proposed in [7]\nand investigate the boundary theory that may be obtained by instead imposing Neumann\nor, more generally, mixed boundary conditions as discussed in [8].\nIn the Neumann variational problem, a consequence of the metric variations being\nnon-vanishing at the boundary is that the boundary stress-energy tensor has to vanish. In\norder to allow for a non-vanishing stress-tensor we need to use mixed Dirichlet-Neumann\nboundary conditions, for which one has to add a gravitational Chern-Simons boundary\nk\nSCS to the bulk action1 [8]. For k = 0 we recover the Neumann case, with vanishing\nterm 4\u03c0\nstress-energy tensor, while k = \u221e sets the graviton fluctuations to zero at the boundary,\nthereby recovering the Dirichlet case. This and a number of other considerations relevant\nto this problem can be found in [7].\nIn light of this it is natural to couple superconformal N = 8 matter, e.g. in the form\nof BLG theory, to (superconformal N = 8) Chern-Simons gravity in order to investigate\nthe whole range of boundary conditions between Dirichlet and Neumann ones. Such a\ncoupled theory was first considered in [9] where part of the theory was obtained. Using\n1\n\nNote that while the bulk theory is parity even the gravitational Chern-Simons boundary term, which\nenforces the mixed boundary conditions, is parity odd.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fthree different methods, Noether, on-shell susy algebra and superspace, we will in this\npaper complete this computation and derive the most general theory of this type, referred\nto as the topologically gauged N = 8 Chern-Simons matter theory (TGCS) in analogy\nwith the N = 6 case derived in [10] and further studied in [11]. One result of coupling\nsuperconformal N = 8 matter to superconformal N = 8 Chern-Simons gravity is that the\nSO(4) gauge group of the BLG theory is either left intact or reduced to SO(3), but, more\nimportantly, the coupling of conformal supergravity to the f ree N = 8 matter can be\nperformed for any gauge group SO(N ). Thus, in this latter case the BLG gauge sector\nhas been replaced by another one related to SO(N ). Furthermore, in this case there is\nonly one Chern-Simons term as opposed to the two SU (2) terms with opposite signs that\noccur in the BLG quiver model. If the gauged theory also has an interpretation in terms\nof branes these theories would then describe arbitrary stacks of M2-branes, although it is\nnot clear how many that would be for a given N .\nThe complete2 Lagrangian for superconformal N = 8 matter coupled to superconformal N = 8 Chern-Simons gravity is given in the next section, but focusing on the\ndeformation of the BLG theory (i.e. N = 4) we get, dropping terms with explicit gravitino\nfields,\nGRA\n+ LBLG\nL = g1 LSU\ncov \u2212\nconf\n\n2\ne\n16 X R\n\n\u2212 V new\n\nig\n+ 64\ne(\u03a8\u0304a \u03a8a X 2 \u2212 10\u03a8\u0304a \u03a8b XaI XbI + 2\u03a8\u0304a \u0393IJ \u03a8b XaI XbJ ),\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere we see that the scalar potential, apart from the original contribution from the BLG\ntheory, has received a new term given by\n\u0011\n\u0010\neg 2\n(1.2)\nV new = 2*32*32\n(X 2 )3 \u2212 8(X 2 )XbJ XcJ XcK XbK + 16XcI XaI XaJ XbJ XbK XcK ,\n\nwhere g is the (conformal) gravitational coupling constant [11] possibly related to a level\nparameter of the gravitational Chern-Simons theory. The theory therefore depends on two\nparameters, the ordinary level parameter \u03bb = 2\u03c0\nk , extracted as usual from the structure\nconstants, and g. As we will see later these can be combined and interpreted as two\nordinary level parameters related to the two CS terms in the quiver version of the theory.\nNote, however, that this new part of the potential is independent of the structure constants\nf abcd and thus appears even if we start the gauging from the free matter theory. In this\ncase we therefore find an entirely new theory with gauge group SO(N ) that is not related\nto BLG at all and is consistent for any N \u2265 1.\nGRA is the action for superconformal N = 8 ChernIn the above Lagrangian LSU\nconf\nSimons gravity, see (2.1) below, LBLG\ncov is the BLG action (2.10) covariantised in the sense\nthat the covariant derivatives also contain a spin connection and an SO(8) R-symmetry\ngauge field. In addition one should note that the usual BLG relation between \u00c3\u03bc b a (the\n3-algebra connection) and A\u03bc b a (the field with respect to which the Lagrangian is varied)\nis generalised to\ng ab\ncd\nab\n\u00c3ab\n\u03bc := A\u03bc (fcd \u2212 4 \u03b4cd ) .\n2\n\nPossibly modulo terms of cubic order in the Rarita-Schwinger field.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fThe new term in the potential given above is positive definite and can be evaluated\nfor a single or a multiple scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV) v. The resulting value\nof the potential is of some importance when looking for background solutions. As will\nbe discussed in more detail in section 2, this theory has AdS3 solutions corresponding to\ntopologically massive supergravity (TMSG) theories. Interestingly enough, similar to the\nN = 6 case where, as pointed out in [10, 11], the AdS solution is at a chiral point in the\nsense of [12], for the theory with N = 8 derived here the value V (v) of the potential is\ndifferent but does also seem to correspond to critical values. In fact, depending on how\nmany scalars p are given the VEV v one finds both critical AdS and critical warped AdS\nsolutions [13]. This difference between N = 8 and N = 6 has of course consequences for\nhow the spectrum is organised in the different cases and should be studied further. We\nintend to return to this question elsewhere.\nWe also investigate whether the particular coupling to conformal supergravity we find\nin N = 8 has a counterpart for N = 6 and find that it does not. This means that the\nresults found in [10, 11] do not admit any further generalisation.\nThe paper is organised as follows: In section 2 the theory is derived using the Noether\nmethod in the 3-algebra formulation, thereby completing the results of [9]. In this section\nit is also explained how to compare these results to the ones obtained in the algebraic\nand superspace approaches presented in the following two sections. Thus in section 3 the\ntheory is derived by closing the on-shell supersymmetry algebra generalising the method\nof the original references [2, 3]. The derivation in superspace is given in section 4, and we\nend with conclusions and a discussion in section 5. Some technical details can be found in\nthe appendices.\n\n2\n\nThe Noether method\n\nThe theory we construct in this paper is the result of turning the global symmetries of\nN = 8 superconformal matter theories into local symmetries without destroying their\nconformal properties. The first example of this kind of gauging was given in [9] where it\nwas applied to the BLG theory. The requirement of maintaining the conformal symmetries\nimplies that the supergravity sector must itself consist of Chern-Simons (CS) terms, or in\nother words, be topological. The topological aspects will play an important r\u00f4le for what\nkind of degrees of freedom the gauged theories describe. That this kind of gauging does not\nadd any new degrees of freedom (see e.g. [14]) was the main reason for the construction\nin [9]. We emphasise again that the construction also leads to a topologically gauged\nversion of the free N = 8 superconformal matter theory in which case we find a somewhat\nunexpected new result: The allowed gauge group is in this case SO(N ) for any positive\ninteger N . Thus our results apply to stacks of branes as well as to a single brane provided\nthe interpretation in terms of branes is still valid after the gauging. For a discussion of\nthis latter question, see [7]. Since the gauged free matter theories are unrelated to what is\nnormally referred to as \"the BLG theory\" we will refer to all of them as just \"topologically\ngauged N = 8 theories\" and use \"BLG\" only when appropriate, i.e., when the gauge group\nis SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2). Note that there is another SO(4) theory with only one CS term, namely\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fthe theory obtained by gauging the free theory for N = 4. As will be clear later there is\nalso a new theory which is a mixture of the two situations described above and that has\nonly one SO(3) as gauge group.\nIn this section we give a brief but hopefully accessible account of the topologically\ngauged N = 8 theories and how to derive them using the Noether method. The account of\nthe complete theory given here in terms of the Lagrangian, transformation rules and field\nequations is written to facilitate the comparison to the results of the other two approaches.\nWe also hope it will benefit the reader to have the theory given both in the three-algebra\nand the quiver versions including an explanation of how to convert between them. Since\nthe three different methods used in this paper to derive the same theory rely on different\nconventions we will also make an effort to relate them.\nWe also take the opportunity to mention here that in the case of N = 6 supersymmetries we provide in a later section a new derivation in superspace proving that the\ntopological gauging of [10] is unique. This can in fact also be seen in the Noether approach\n[10] since there one can analyse the cancellation options for the relevant terms in \u03b4L where\nthis question arises.\n2.1\n\nThe conformal supergravity sector\n\nWe start by presenting the pure conformal supergravity sector that is independent of the\nconventions used in the CS matter sector and is therefore the same in the three-algebra\nand quiver formulations. The fields in on-shell N = 8 conformal supergravity are the\ndreibein, e\u03bc \u03b1 , the Rarita-Schwinger field, \u03c7\u03bc with a hidden R-symmetry spinor index, and\nthe R-symmetry gauge field, B\u03bci j . The topological CS Lagrangian is [9, 15\u201317]\n2\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\nT r\u03b1 (\u03c9\u0303\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c9\u0303\u03c1 + \u03c9\u0303\u03bc \u03c9\u0303\u03bd \u03c9\u0303\u03c1 ) \u2212 ie\u22121 \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3 (D\u0303\u03bc \u03c7\u0304\u03bd \u03b3\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b1 D\u0303\u03c1 \u03c7\u03c3 )\nLconf\nsugra = 2 \u01eb\n3\n2\n(2.1)\n\u2212\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 T ri (B\u03bc \u2202\u03bd B\u03c1 + B\u03bc B\u03bd B\u03c1 ),\n3\nwhere the traces are over the three- and eight-dimensional vector indices for the spinconnection and SO(8) R-symmetry gauge field, respectively. The tilde on the covariant\nderivatives refers to the spin connection \u03c9\u0303\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 which contains an ordinary second-order term\n\u03c9(e) plus a contorsion term K bilinear in the Rarita-Schwinger field \u03c7\u03bc . The covariant\nderivative is given explicitly in the subsection on the BLG theory below. Thus the three\nChern-Simons terms in this Lagrangian are of third, second and first order in derivatives,\nrespectively.\nThe standard procedure to obtain local supersymmetry for the spin-connection is to\nstart by adding Rarita-Schwinger terms to the dreibein-compatible \u03c9(e). That is, one\ndefines\n\u03c9\u0303\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 + K\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(2.2)\nwith\nand\n\n1\n\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03a9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03a9\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc + \u03a9\u03b2\u03bc\u03b1 ), \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd \u03b1 = \u2202\u03bc e\u03bd \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bd e\u03bc \u03b1 ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\ni\nK\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 (\u03c7\u03bc \u03b3\u03b2 \u03c7\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc \u03b3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c7\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c7\u03b2 ).\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThis combination of spin connection and contorsion is supercovariant, i.e. derivatives on the\nsupersymmetry parameter cancel out if \u03c9\u0303\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 is varied under the ordinary transformations\nof the dreibein and Rarita-Schwinger field:\n\u03b4e\u03bc \u03b1 = i\u01ed\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03c7\u03bc , \u03b4\u03c7\u03bc = D\u0303\u03bc \u01eb.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe above Lagrangian is then supersymmetric if the R-symmetry gauge field varies according to\ni\n\u03b4B\u03bcij = \u2212 \u01edg \u0393ij \u03b3\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc f \u03bd + \u03b4B\u03bcij |new\n(2.6)\n2e\nwhere f \u03bc = 21 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 D\u0303\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1 and \u03b4B\u03bcij |new is a new term that is zero here but needed in the\ncoupling to matter.

These new terms are all without derivatives and will be fed back into the\ncomputation through the second term in \u03b4Lconf\nsugra above which then gives rise to terms that\nare first order in derivatives but quartic in fermions (counting also the susy parameter)\nand at least bilinear in the \u03c7\u03bc .\nThis supergravity theory is also invariant [9] under the following superconformal transformations with parameter \u03b7(x):\n\n\u03b4S e\u03bc \u03b1 = 0, \u03b4S \u03c7\u03bc = \u03b3\u03bc \u03b7, \u03b4S B\u03bcij = 2i \u03b7\u0304\u0393ij \u03c7\u03bc ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nand dilatations with parameter \u03c6(x):\n\u03b4\u2206 e\u03bc \u03b1 = \u2212\u03c6e\u03bc \u03b1 , \u03b4\u2206 \u03c7\u03bc = \u2212 21 \u03c6\u03c7\u03bc , \u03b4\u2206 B\u03bcij = 0.\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe strategy we will adopt in the Noether construction is to not allow \u03b4\u03c7\u03bc = D\u0303\u03bc \u01eb to\nbe extended by a term proportional to a \u03b3 matrix thereby eliminating the possibility\nof the S-supersymmetry to mix with ordinary supersymmetry in the derivation of the\ngauged theory. Allowing for such a mixing would just complicate the calculations without\nadding any extra information apart from proving also the superconformal invariance of the\nwhole theory. However, this invariance is built into the superspace formulation and will be\ndiscussed more fully in that context.\n2.2\n\nThe covariantised matter sector in the 3-algebra formulation\n\nWe now turn to the 3-algebra formulation of the CS-matter sector. It contains the fields\nof the N = 8 BLG theory, i.e., eight real scalars, Xai , in the vector representation (indices\ni, j, k, ..) of the SO(8) R-symmetry group and eight Majorana spinors, \u03c8a , in a chiral spinor\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\frepresentation of SO(8) (here with non-explicit spinor indices) together with a set of ChernSimons gauge fields A\u03bca b in an as yet unspecified gauge group which acts on the 3-algebra\nindex (a, b, c, ...) possessed by both the scalar and spinor fields. Recall that the classical\nungauged BLG theory in flat space-time is consistent only for the gauge group SO(4)\nwhile quantum mechanically the situation is rather different (see, e.g., [6]). The CS-matter\nLagrangian explicitly covariantised under the new local symmetries diffeomorphisms, Rsymmetry and supersymmetry reads [9]\nac cb\n2\nLBLG = \u2212 12 e g \u03bc\u03bd D\u0303\u03bc Xai D\u0303\u03bd Xai + 2i e\u03c8\u0304a \u03b3 \u03bc D\u0303\u03bc \u03c8a + 12 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (A\u03bcab \u2202\u03bd \u00c3ab\n\u03c1 + 3 A\u03bcab \u00c3\u03bd \u00c3\u03c1 )\n\n+ 4i e\u03c8\u0304a \u0393ij \u03c8b Xci Xdj f abcd \u2212\n\nabcd i j k\n1\nXb Xc Xd )(f aef g Xei Xfj Xgk ),\n12 e(f\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere we see that the scalar potential is positive definite and can be written as\nV (X) =\n\n\u03bb2 abcd i j k\nXb Xc Xd )(\u01ebaef g Xei Xfj Xgk ),\n12 (\u01eb\n\n(2.11)\n\nafter using the substitution of the structure constants by \u03bb \u01ebabcd which is possible since the\ngauge group is SO(4) in this case. Here \u03bb is related to the level k by \u03bb = 2\u03c0\nk .\nThe supergravity covariant derivative is\nD\u0303\u03bc \u03c8a = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8a + 41 \u03c9\u0303\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8a + 14 B\u03bcij \u0393ij \u03c8a + \u00c3\u03bcab \u03c8b ,\n\n(2.12)\n\ncd cdab\n\u00c3ab\n.\n\u03bc := A\u03bc f\n\n(2.13)\n\nand\nHere the structure constants are completely antisymmetric and indices are raised and\nlowered with a delta (so we can be cavalier about the position, up or down, of the threealgebra indices) to avoid problems with unitarity in the scalar field sector. As a result of\nchecking supersymmetry the structure constant must satisfy the fundamental identity3\nf [abc g f e]f g d = 0.\n\n(2.14)\n\nIn terms of finite dimensional 3-algebras, this identity is known to have only one solution\ncd cdab being an element of the Lie algebra of SO(4). The fact\ncorresponding to \u00c3ab\n\u03bc := A\u03bc f\nthat SO(4) is the unique gauge group is in general not changed by the gauging which can\nbe seen in all three approaches as long as the structure constants are non-zero. However,\nby tuning the two parameters it is possible to project away one of the two SU (2) factors.\nFurthermore, it is very important to note that after gauging one can set the ordinary BLG\nstructure constants to zero, or just derive the gauged theory from a free N = 8 matter\ntheory. In either case one finds a theory without any restrictions on the range of the 3algebra indices and containing only a single Chern-Simons term with a gauge group SO(N )\nfor any N . This fact is clear in all three approaches.\nThe supersymmetry transformation rules are\n\u03b4Xai = i\u01edm \u0393i \u03c8a ,\n3\n\nThe form of the identity given here was obtained in [18].\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(2.15)\n\n\f\u03b4\u03c8a = \u03b3 \u03bc \u0393i \u01ebm D\u0303\u03bc Xai \u2212 61 \u0393ijk \u01ebm Xbi Xcj Xdk f abcd + \u03b4\u03c8a |new ,\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u03bc i i\ncdab\n\u03b4\u00c3ab\n+ \u03b4\u00c3ab\n\u03bc = i\u01edm \u03b3 \u0393 Xc \u03c8d f\n\u03bc |new ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nand\nwhere we have indicated where the corrections will appear in the topologically gauged\ntheory. Note that elimination of the BLG gauge fields by setting the structure constants\nto zero thus just means that a new set of gauge fields are introduced as already mentioned.\nNote also that the parameter \u01ebm has an index m for matter since we will need to\nnormalise it in a different way compared to the parameter in the supergravity sector which\nwe henceforth will denote as \u01ebg in the Noether construction. This notation will also be\nuseful when comparing the Noether approach to the algebraic and superspace ones.\n2.3\n\nThe new interactions in gauged BLG and the new N = 8 SO(N ) theories\n\nWe now turn to the new interaction terms that arise as a result of the gauging and that are\nnot already included in the covariantised version of the BLG theory discussed above. As\nin the ABJM case in [10] there are new interaction terms both with and without structure\nconstants although some of the terms that appear in the N = 6 case vanish identically in the\nN = 8 situation discussed here. For example, using the antisymmetric structure constants\nabove, it is easy to see that no sixth-order scalar potential term can be constructed with\nonly one structure constant in the N = 8 case.\nThere will appear two parameters, \u03bb and g, in the expressions below of which the\nformer is related to the structure constant as f abcd = \u03bb\u01ebabcd , with \u03bb = 2\u03c0\nk and k is the level.\nThe parameter g, on the other hand, is a dimensionless gravitational coupling constant\n2 in the analogues N = 6 discussion of [11]) that must appear in such a way\n(denoted gM\nthat the gravitational and matter sectors can be decoupled by letting g go to zero. While\nthe way g appears is the same in all three approaches, the way it is introduced into the\ntheory as well as its interpretation vary between the approaches. The two parameters will\naffect also the BLG part of the action and in particular the Chern-Simons term as will be\nexplained in more detail below.\nBefore doing that, however, we would like to emphasise that setting the structure\nconstants, or \u03bb in the formulae below, to zero makes it possible to introduce a new gauge\ngroup, namely SO(N ) for any N . This result is supported by the fact that, in any of three\napproaches, the range of the three-algebra index does not play any role in the calculation.\nInterestingly enough, there is a special new case with non-zero \u03bb but with a gauge group\ncd \u2212 \u03bb\u01ebcdab corresponds\nthat is different from the BLG one, namely when the expression g4 \u03b4ab\nto P\u00b1 = 12 (\u03b4\u03b4 \u00b1 12 \u01eb) which projects onto the self- and anti-selfdual parts. The gauge group\nhas then only one SO(3) factor and hence only one CS term in the gauge sector.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fThe Lagrangian derived here takes the following form, using f abcd = \u03bb\u01ebabcd ,\nBLG\ni \u03bd \u03bc\ni\ni\ni\nL = g1 Lsugra\nconf + Lcov + iAe\u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u0393 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03c8a (D\u0303\u03bd Xa \u2212 2 A\u03c7\u0304\u03bd \u0393 \u03c8a )\n\u03bc ijk\ni j k abcd\n+\n\u2212 ie\u03bb\n6 A\u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u03b3 \u0393 \u03c8a Xb Xc Xd \u01eb\n\n\u03bc\u03bd ijkl\nie\n\u03c7\u03bd Xai Xbj Xck Xdl \u01ebabcd\n48 \u03bb\u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u03b3 \u0393\n\n\u2212 4i \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u0393ij \u03c7\u03bd (Xai D\u0303\u03c1 Xaj ) + iAf \u0304\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc \u0393i \u03c8a Xai + 4i X 2 f \u0304\u03bc \u03c7\u03bc \u2212\n\n2\ne\n16 X R\n\n\u03bc i\ni 2\nj j i\n+ igA\n32 e\u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u03b3 \u0393 \u03c8a (Xa X \u2212 4Xa Xb Xb )\n\nig \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u2212 256\n\u01eb \u03c7\u0304\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1 ((X 2 )2 \u2212 4(Xai Xaj )(Xbi Xbj ))\n\nig\ne(\u03c8\u0304a \u03c8a X 2 \u2212 10\u03c8\u0304a \u03c8b Xai Xbi + 2\u03c8\u0304a \u0393ij \u03c8b Xai Xbj )\n+ 64\n2\n\neg\n\u2212 2*32*32\n((X 2 )3 \u2212 8(X 2 )(Xai Xaj )(Xbi Xbj ) + 16(Xai Xaj )(Xbj Xbk )(Xck Xci )),\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere A2 = 12 , X 2 := Xai Xai and the covariant derivative is as given above.

The first step is to add the coupling term between the two\nsectors, the supergravity and CS-matter sectors, i.e., the supercurrent term which is the\nlast term on the first line in the Lagrangian. It couples the Rarita-Schwinger field \u03c7\u03bc to the\nsupercurrent constructed to be conserved at the linear level in the fields4 . In the standard\nfashion conservation of the supercurrent implies a gauge transformation of the gauge field,\nwhich in this case is just the supersymmetry transformation \u03b4\u03c7\u03bc = D\u0303\u03bc \u01ebg .\n4\n\nThere is another conserved supercurrent which, however, can be seen to be equivalent to the one used\nhere modulo terms involving the Dirac equation.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fThe variation of the Lagrangian is then organised according to the number of covariant\nderivatives (counting field strengths as two derivatives) in each term. Cancelling all terms\nin \u03b4L of second order in derivatives (third-order terms occur only in the supergravity\nsector) requires the addition of new terms in the Lagrangian and in the transformation\nrules. These new terms are the ones in the second and third lines in the Lagrangian (which\nare independent of the parameter g) and all the new terms in the variation of the gauge\nfield \u03b4B\u03bcij |new while only the new g independent term in \u03b4\u00c3ab\n\u03bc |new is derived at this stage\nin the calculation. The term \u03b4\u03c8a |new , on the other hand, is determined entirely at order\none derivative. This result was obtained already in [9] to which we refer the reader for the\ndetails of the calculation.\nTo cancel also the terms at order one derivative in \u03b4L we need to add the terms\ncorresponding to \u03b4\u03c8a |new and the g dependent terms in \u03b4\u00c3ab\n\u03bc |new . The remaining terms in\nthe Lagrangian all arise at this level except the potential term which is multiplied by g2 .\nAt this point the full set of transformation rules is determined. The terms at this order\nthat we need to prove cancel in \u03b4L are with two spinors\n\u01ebD\u03c8X 3 , \u01ebD\u03c7X 4 ,\n\n(2.26)\n\n\u01ebD\u03c7\u03c8 2 , \u01ebD\u03c72 \u03c8X, \u01ebD\u03c73 X 2 ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nand with four spinors\nwhere the last three have not been checked in detail.\nFinally, checking that also the non-derivative terms cancel in \u03b4L will provide the coefficients of the new scalar potential terms proportional to g2 but beyond that we only get\na number of cross-checks. The terms involved here have two up to eight fermionic quantities (fields together with the supersymmetry parameter) and some of the cancellations\nwill lead to extensive fierzing. In the Noether approach, however, we have only done the\ncomputations needed to obtain the final terms in the Lagrangian with one cross-check on\nthe coefficients in the potential. The Lagrangian presented above is, however, the complete\nanswer possibly up to terms cubic in the Rarita-Schwinger fields. However, although we\ndon't know for sure if terms with more than two Rarita-Schwinger fields can occur, we\nknow from the Noether calculation with N = 6 supersymmetries carried out in [10] that\nsome terms of this kind were checked and seen not to appear. Modulo such cubic and\nhigher terms in the Rarita-Schwinger field, the only four-fermi term in the Lagrangian is\nthe term that supercovariantises the the derivative in the supercurrent term.\nThe terms without derivatives that have explicitly been checked to cancel are\n\u01eb\u03c7X 6 , \u01eb\u03c8X 3\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhich fixes the coefficients in the potential and provides one cross-check on the result.\nIn addition we have confirmed that the terms \u01eb\u03c8 3 X cancel which requires some simple\nfierzing. This calculation can be found in the Appendix.\nWe end this subsection with a discussion of the CS terms in the gauge sector since\nthese have changed relative the covariantised BLG theory given above but we have not\nabcd has been\nyet explained exactly what has happened.

We will in fact take advantage of this\nproperty of the CS term below. That this is a correct procedure for dealing with the CS\nterm is supported by the results of all three approaches as will be demonstrated in the last\nsubsection.\nThus we end the discussion here by just quoting the answer:\n\nLCS(A) =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n2\nac cb\n\u01eb (A\u03bcab \u2202\u03bd \u00c3ab\n\u03c1 + A\u03bcab \u00c3\u03bd \u00c3\u03c1 ),\n2\n3\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere, as indicated by the form of \u03b4\u00c3ab\n\u03bc , we have\ncd\ncd\ncdab\n),\n\u00c3ab\n\u2212 g4 \u03b4ab\n\u03bc := A\u03bc (\u03bb\u01eb\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhich is a direct generalisation of the ungauged BLG definition which corresponds to g = 0.\n2.4\n\nThe field equations and AdS3 background solutions\n\nWe start with the field equations in the supergravity sector. The Cotton and Cottino\nequations are easily obtained from the Lagrangian given in the previous subsection but\nsince we will here primarily be interested in the background solution only the bosonic part\nof the Cotton equation is given.\nThe variation with respect to the dreibein, or the metric if the spinors are set to zero,\nleads to the following Cotton equation\n1\ng C\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212\n\neX 2\n16 (R\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212 12 g\u03bc\u03bd R) + 2e g\u03bc\u03bd V (X)\n\n\u2212 2e (D\u03bc Xai D\u03bd Xai \u2212 12 g\u03bc\u03bd D \u03c3 Xai D\u03c3 Xai ) \u2212\n\n2\ne\n16 g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003X\n\n+\n\n2\ne\n16 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd X\n\n= 0.\n\n(2.31)\n\nThe equation of motion for the R-symmetry gauge fields, on the other hand, will be useful\nto have in more detail.

Discarding the\nfermions it becomes \u0003Xai \u2212 18 Xai R \u2212 \u2202Xai V (X) = 0 which can be seen to be consistent\nwith the trace of the Cotton equation. In fact, combining these two scalar equations leads\nto the condition on the potential X\u2202X V (X) = 6V (X) which is obviously correct in a\nthree-dimensional conformally invariant theory.

However, there is an important difference namely that while\nin N = 6 the solution [10, 11] corresponds to a chiral point in the sense of [12] that is not\nquite the case here. Determining the relevant parameters as defined in [12] we find for the\ntheories discussed here that \u03bcl = 13 while the chiral point corresponds \u03bcl = 1. The value\n\u03bcl = 1 is, however, obtained if we give two scalar fields the same VEV. Using the following\nform of the scalar VEV matrix5\n!\nv1p\u00d7p 0\ni\n< Xa >=\n,\n0 0\nwith p = 2 thus gives an AdS solution of the kind found in the N = 6 case. Interestingly\nenough, by giving the same VEV to 3 or 6 scalars, i.e., for p = 3 or p = 6, we also find\nsolutions corresponding to the critical value \u03bcl = 3 in the analysis of warped AdS3 in [13].\nNote that ending up at some critical point is natural for reasons having to do with massive\ngraviton modes whose presence would be hard to explain from the point of view of the\ntopological gauging, see for instance the discussion in [7]. This analysis still needs to be\ndone in detail and will be discussed elsewhere. Finally, four scalars with the same VEV\ngives a vanishing V new . Note that this discussion of solutions is valid for the case with zero\nBLG structure constants, i.e., for the new SO(N ) theories, and may be altered for p \u2265 3\nif the BLG structure constants are kept non-zero.\n2.5\n\nRewriting the results of the Noether 3-algebra approach in quiver form\n\nWe will now convert the theory above from the 3-algebra to the quiver formulation. The\nfield equations written in this formulation will then be easily compared to the ones obtained\nin the superspace approach which is also in quiver form. As will be clear below, in the\nquiver formulation it is natural to introduce the two parameters discussed above as two\n5\n\nThis analysis may be carried out also for the new potential in the topologically gauged N = 6 case [10].\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\flevel parameters tied to the two chiral parts of the gauge field since after the topological\ngauging they are no longer related to each other. However, we find that the gravitational\nChern-Simons terms in the gauged theory do not seem to make room for any additional\nlevel parameters although levels can be defined also in that sector, see e.g. Horne and\nWitten [19]. In fact, the three methods of derivation introduce the free parameters in\ndifferent ways and seemingly for different reasons. Nevertheless, they all point at the same\nresult, namely that the maximum number of free parameters (or levels) is just two.\n2.5.1\n\nConversion rules\n\nStarting from the real fields Xai where i takes 8 values and the 3-algebra index a 4 values\n(as a vector of the gauge group SO(4)) and introducing elements T a of the three-algebra\nsatisfying T r(T a T b ) = \u03b4ab we define X\u0302 i = Xai T a .

In particular we need to show that all quiver expressions in three\nfields can be written with one trace in order to translate them to the 3-algebra language.\nThat this is indeed the case can be shown as follows. The set of five possible expressions\nwith three quiver fields contains two expressions with a trace\nA = (X i )m\u0304 m tr(X j X \u2020j ), B = (X j )m\u0304 m tr(X i X \u2020j ),\n\n(2.47)\n\nand three expressions without a trace\nC = (X i X \u2020j X j )m\u0304 m , D = (X j X \u2020i X j )m\u0304 m , E = (X j X \u2020j X i )m\u0304 m ,\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n(2.48)\n\n\fwhich, however, are linearly dependent. In fact, by cycling the two-dimensional indices it\nfollows that A and B may be used as a basis:\nC = E = 21 A, D = B \u2212 12 A.\n\n(2.49)\n\nNext we use the four-dimensional 3-algebra indices (assuming that the gauge group\nis SO(4)) to split the fields into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. We consider first the\ncovariant derivative\ng\n\u2212\nD\u03bc Xa = \u2202\u03bc Xa + \u00c3\u03bcab Xb = \u2202\u03bc Xa + (2\u03bb \u2212 4g )A+\n\u03bcab Xb \u2212 (2\u03bb + 4 )A\u03bcab Xb\ng\n\u2212\n= \u2202\u03bc Xa + (2\u03bb \u2212 4g )A+\n\u03bcab Xb + (2\u03bb + 4 )Xb A\u03bcba .\n\n(2.50)\n\nTo get these expressions into quiver form we multiply by 3-algebra elements T a and define,\nfollowing [20], the covariant derivative to be\ng\nn\nm\u0304\nn\u0304 R m\u0304\nD\u03bc Xm m\u0304 = \u2202\u03bc Xm m\u0304 \u2212 ( g8 \u2212 \u03bb)AL\n\u03bcm Xn + ( 8 + \u03bb)Xm A\u03bcn\u0304 .\n\n(2.51)\n\nTo reach this form we have used the relations\n1 L/R\nA\u00b1\n= 2i AL/R4i\n\u03c3i ,\n\u03bc = 2 A\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n(2.52)\n\nwhere the gauge fields belong to the gauge group SUL (2) \u00d7 SUR (2), i.e. the index structure\ni\nn\nR4i i\nn\u0304\nis AL4i\n\u03bc (\u03c3 )m and A\u03bc (\u03c3 )m\u0304 . As a final step we absorb the multiplicative factors into\nthe gauge fields to get the covariant derivative in its standard form\nn\nm\u0304\nn\u0304 R m\u0304\nD\u03bc Xm m\u0304 = \u2202\u03bc Xm m\u0304 \u2212 AL\n\u03bcm Xn + Xm A\u03bcn\u0304 .\n\n(2.53)\n\nNow we repeat these steps for the CS term where we should note the factor of i in the\ndefinition of the quiver gauge fields above which therefore are anti-hermitian.

In\nthe latter case one must as usual first rescale away the inverse factor of g in front of the\ngravitational Chern-Simons terms so that the limit is not singular and all gravitational\ncouplings to matter and gravitational self-interactions become proportional to positive\npowers of g. This is done by sending the variation of the dreibein, the Rarita-Schwinger\n\u221a\nand R-symmetry fields to g times themselves. Note the gauge field Aab\n\u03bc appears in a\nslightly different form when using the above definition of the corresponding tilde field.

This is most easily done by verifying that the\nfinal form of the transformation rules are the same which can be done after finding the\nproper relations between fields and parameters in three cases. There is a number of sign\nconventions that we will not try to sort out. Instead we will determine the connection\nbetween the parameters in the various approaches only up to signs but this will be enough\nto see that the most important features, like the form of the new potential terms, are\nexactly the same in all three approaches.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fConsider first the transformation rules obtained in the Noether approach written in\n3-algebra language and the ones derived in the algebraic on-shell supersymmetry approach\nin the next section. The equivalence between these two sets of transformation rules is\nestablished if one extracts \u03bb as usual from the structure constants in the latter case and\nset\n1 2\n\u03b12 = 16\ng .\n(2.72)\nIn this case also signs can be made to match by noting the freedom we have to place the\ngamma matrices in a prescribed order. This will produce signs in the algebraic approach\nsince there the gamma matrices in the space-time directions anti-commute with those in\nthe eight internal directions.\nNext we recall the quiver form of the transformation rules in the Noether approach\nobtained in the previous subsection. To translate the corresponding equations obtained\nin the superspace approach back to the Noether approach we need to identify fields and\nparameters as follows, with A2 = 12 ,\n\u039b = \u03c8, XI = A\u22121 X i , \u01eb = \u01ebg = A\u22121 \u01ebm ,\n\n(2.73)\n\nThis will also establish the equivalence of the supersymmetry algebras in the different\napproaches. Inspecting the transformation rules for the scalar and spinor fields in the\nmatter sector we find that the equivalence between the Noether and superspace approaches\nfollows from the identifications:\nb = 21 (a + a\u2032 ) = 8g , c = 12 (a \u2212 a\u2032 ) = \u2212\u03bb,\n\n(2.74)\n\nand hence\na=\n\n3\n\ng\n8\n\n\u2212 \u03bb, a\u2032 =\n\ng\n8\n\n+ \u03bb.\n\n(2.75)\n\nThe SUSY algebra approach\n\nIn this section we will outline how to derive the field equations of N = 8 superconformal\nmatter-coupled supergravity in three dimensions by requiring that the supersymmetry\nalgebra closes. This method was used by Bagger and Lambert [3] to derive the BLG theory\nand below we will see that extra structure is allowed, in the sense that the SO(4) symmetry\nof the BLG theory can be replaced by SO(N ), by coupling to N = 8 superconformal ChernSimons gravity. The presentation here will focus on the method and results; for more\ntechnical details see appendix C. The computations in this section have been facilitated by\nusing the Mathematica package GAMMA [21].\n3.1\n\nField equations of topologically gauged N = 8 BLG and SO(N ) theories\n\nUsing the same conventions as in [9], we have the following SUSY transformations for\nconformal Chern-Simons supergravity\n\u03b4e\u03bc \u03b1 = i\u01ed\u0393\u03b1 \u03c7\u03bc ,\n\u03b4\u03c7\u03bc = D\u0303\u03bc \u01eb ,\ni\n\u03b4B\u03bcIJ = \u2212 e\u22121 \u01ed\u0393IJ \u0393\u03bd \u0393\u03bc f \u03bd ,\n2\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fwhere \u03c7 is the gravitino and B\u03bcIJ is the SO(8) gauge field.

To simplify\nthe ansatz we have used the freedom of making field redefinitions and the fact that two\nSUSY transformations of the fields are only allowed to contain \u2202\u01eb-terms when acting on\ngauge fields7 .\nThe commutator of two supersymmetry transformations must close up to the symmetries of the theory; in our case general coordinate transformations, supersymmetry transformations, Lorentz transformations, SO(8) and three-algebra gauge transformations and\nsuperconformal transformations. Note that all the global symmetries of BLG have been\npromoted to local ones when we couple to supergravity.\nDue to the simplicity of \u03b4XaI we start by computing the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations on XaI in order to identify the parameters of the symmetry\ntransformations into which the SUSY algebra closes.

In addition to the standard BLG terms [3] there is now a local supersymmetry\ntransformation, a local SO(8) rotation and an additional term in \u039b\u0303b a .\nWe now turn to the computation of [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]\u03a8a .

To start, we note that we must have \u03b11 = \u00b1 2 from the requirement that [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]e\u03bc \u03b1 generates the same transport term as in [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]XaI .\nWe now analyse the different gamma-structures in (3.6). The \u0393(5) term does not\nrepresent symmetries of the theory, as can be seen from (3.5), and therefore this term\nmust vanish. From the \u0393(1) term we can read off the Dirac equation, and finally the \u0393(2)\nconstitutes a consistency condition. Collecting the results10 we find\n\u03b12 = \u03b11 (2\u03b15 + 14 \u03b17 ) ,\n\u03b13 = 2\u03b17 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u03b16 = 21 \u03b17 ,\nand the Dirac equations is\n/\u0303 a + 1 \u0393IJ XcI XdJ f cdb a \u03a8b + (3\u03b15 +\n0 = D\u03a8\n2\n+ (3\u03b14 + 2\u03b17 )XaI XbI \u03a8b + (3\u03b14 +\n\n\u03b17\n2\nI I \u03bc\n1\n4 )X \u03a8a \u2212 \u03b11 Xa \u0393 \u0393 f\u03bc\nI J\n\u03b17\n2 )\u0393IJ Xa Xb \u03a8b ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere we have included \u03c7-terms yielding curvatures upon variation as they will be important in the derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation below.\n8\n\nThis also means that we will not be careful regarding determinants of the vielbein in the expressions\nbelow as they will only give gravitino terms upon supersymmetry variation.

We thus see that in order to access the\nSO(N ) sequence of gauge groups for N > 4 we need to set f abcd , which parametrizes the\nBLG theory, to zero. Note however that when the range of the three-algebra indices is four\nwe do get a deformation of the BLG theory, with the interesting self- and anti-self-dual\ncases discussed in section 2.\nWe now turn to closing the SUSY algebra on the gravitino. To lowest order in the\ngravitino it is only the superconformal transformation that contribute in the right-hand\nside of the algebra\n[\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]\u03c7\u03bc = \u03b4S \u03c7\u03bc + O(\u03c7) .\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe vanishing of terms not of this form implies that\n\u03b13 + 8\u03b14 = 0 ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nand the requirement of matching the superconformal transformation read off from closing\nthe supersymmetry algebra on \u03a8a yields\n\u03b15 = \u2212 18 \u03b17 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nLet us now consider the SO(8) gauge field.

The most notable outcome of coupling\nto gravity is that the allowed gauge group is SO(N ) for N \u2265 1.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f4\n\nSuperspace\n\nIn this part of the paper we discuss these models from the superspace point of view. The\nfields can be thought of as belonging to three multiplets: conformal supergravity, YangMills and scalar. The first of these can be described off-shell for any N , and as this has\nbeen discussed previously in the literature [22\u201326] we have relegated it to appendix D. However, the treatment given there is quite detailed and contains some previously unpublished\nmaterial on the completeness of the solution to the Bianchi identities and N = 6 as well\nas the conventions for this section. The basic feature of the off-shell conformal supergravity field strength multiplet, for N \u2265 4, is that it is given by a constrained dimension-one\nLorentz-scalar superfield, MIJKL , that is totally antisymmetric on its SO(N ) indices. This\nsuperfield contains the Cotton and Cottino tensors amongst its components and can therefore be thought of as the super Cotton tensor. A similar situation holds in the Yang-Mills\nsector where there is another constrained dimension-one superfield WIJ [27, 28]. The\nconstraints are given in (D.9) for gravity and (D.20) for Yang-Mills. For conformal supergravity this leads to the multiplet structure given in Figure 1 in appendix D, while a\nsimilar picture, given by Figure 2, is valid for the Yang-Mills sector. On the other hand\nthe scalar multiplets for N = 6 and N = 8 are on-shell. They both consist of (sets of)\neight scalars and spinors so the basic constraints, which state that the former transform\ninto the latter, necessarily imply the equations of motion by supersymmetry.\nTo construct the complete on-shell theory we therefore need to specify the super Cotton\ntensor MIJKL and the Yang-Mills tensor WIJ in terms of the scalar multiplet fields. Since\nthese both have dimension one it follows that they must be bilinears in the scalar fields,\nand from the basic constraint on the latter it follows that the constraints on M and W are\nsatisfied, and hence that the Bianchi identities for both gravity and Yang-Mills are also\nsatisfied, as discussed in D.2.\nThe problem is therefore to check that these equations are consistent with the Ricci\nidentity for the scalar multiplet.11 For the latter, the anti-commutator of two odd superspace derivatives acting on the scalar, or the spinor, will give rise to terms involving the\ntorsion, the geometrical curvatures and the Yang-Mills field strength, and it turns out to be\nsufficient to check this anti-commutator for the scalars. From this consistency constraint,\ngiven that the Bianchi identities in the gauge and geometry sectors hold, the restrictions\non the possible gauge groups that are allowed can be derived. By applying further odd\nderivatives one can then obtain the equations of motion for the spacetime fields.\nIn the following we shall occasionally refer to (p, q) forms, superspace forms with p even\nand q odd indices. For example, the Bianchi identity for a Yang-Mills field is I := DF = 0,\nand the lowest-dimensional component of this is the one with all odd indices, i.e. I0,3 .\n4.1\n\nMatter multiplets\n\nFor a vector field in D = 3 the conformal Lagrangian is the Chern-Simons term so that in\nthe absence of any matter the equation of motion states that the spacetime field strength\nis zero, and the superspace extension of this is simply that the whole of the superspace\n11\n\nBy Ricci identity we mean the definition of a curvature in terms of a graded commutator of derivatives.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\ffield strength vanishes. When matter is present the spacetime field strength will be given\nby the dual of the matter current and in superspace this implies that all components of the\nfield strength will be given as bilinears in the matter fields. There have been discussions\nof these models in the literature in a superspace context in [29\u201331], from a pure spinor\ninspired point of view, in [32, 33] using superfields and the Nambu bracket formulation of\nBLG, and in [27, 28] in a more conventional approach that is close to ours.\nIn this section we shall briefly recap what happens in flat superspace in a Lie-algebra\nformalism. We shall take the gauge group to be G \u00d7 G\u2032 in N = 6 and recover the result\nthat G = G\u2032 = SU (2) for N = 8.\nWe begin with N = 8.12 The scalar multiplet has eight scalars XI and eight spinors\n\u039b\u03b1A\u2032 , so the constraint on the superfield XI must be\n\u2032\n\nD\u03b1A XI = i(\u03a3I )AA\u2032 \u039bA\n\u03b1 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nHere, the derivative is gauge-covariant with respect to the group G \u00d7 G\u2032 , so the Ricci\nidentity is\n\u2032\n[D\u03b1A , D\u03b2B ]XI = i\u03b4AB (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Da XI \u2212 aF\u03b1A\u03b2B XI + a\u2032 XI F\u03b1A\u03b2B\n,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere a, a\u2032 are real constants. To check the consistency of the Ricci identity we can\nparametrise the variation of \u039b as\n1\n(4.3)\nD\u03b1A \u039b\u03b2B \u2032 = (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03a3I )AB \u2032 Da XI + \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 HAB \u2032 + (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 HaAB \u2032 .\n2\nThe first term is there in the absence of interactions while the fields appearing the second\nand third will be functions of the matter fields as we are on-shell. In order to determine\nthese we need first to say something about the lowest-dimensional components of the\nfields strengths. The scalar X has dimension one-half, \u039b dimension one and F0,2 also has\ndimension one. The latter can therefore only be bilinear in X. We have13\nF\u03b1A\u03b2B = i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03a3IJ )AB XI XJ\u2217\n\nand\n\n\u2032\n= i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03a3IJ )AB XI\u2217 XJ ,\nF\u03b1A\u03b2B\n\n(4.4)\n\nUsing (4.1) we can easily see that these constraints are compatible with the Bianchi identities for F, F \u2032 . The dimension three-halves component of F is given by\nFa\u03b2B = (\u03b3a \u03c7)\u03b2B ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nand similarly for F \u2032 where\n\n\u03c7\u03b1A = i(\u03a3I (XI \u039b\u2217 \u2212 \u039bXI\u2217 ))\u03b1A\n\n\u03c7\u2032\u03b1A = i(\u03a3I (XI\u2217 \u039b \u2212 \u039b\u2217 XI ))\u03b1A .\n\n12\n\n(4.6)\n\nFor N = 8 the R-symmetry group is taken to be Spin(8) rather than SO(8) whence the spinor Rsymmetry index A. See appendix D.\n13\n\u2032\nIn other words these equations give WAB and WAB\nin terms of the scalars.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fAs discussed in appendix D it suffices to show that the (0, 3) component of the Bianchi\nidentity holds, which it clearly does given equations (4.1) and (4.4)\nSubstituting (4.3) into (4.2) we find, in the case of flat superspace, that HaBC \u2032 = 0,\nand that\n\u2032\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2(\u03a3I )[A C HB]C \u2032 = (\u03a3JK )AB (b(XJ XK\nXI \u2212 XI XJ\u2217 XK ) + c(XJ XK\nXI + XI XJ\u2217 XK )) ,\n(4.7)\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere b := 2 (a + a ) and c := 2 (a \u2212 a ). The terms cubic in X contain the representations\n(1000), (0011) and (1100) of SO(8), but only the first two are contained in HAB \u2032 . The\nmixed symmetry representation must therefore be excluded. It appears inevitably in the\nb term, so that b must be set to zero, i.e. a = \u2212a\u2032 . This means that the coefficients\nof the two Chern-Simons terms in the spacetime action must have equal magnitude and\nopposite sign. The c term will also have a mixed symmetry component except for the case\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2), and when XI is real,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nXx x \u2192 X\u0304 x x\u2032 = \u03b5xy Xy y \u03b5y\u2032 x\u2032 \u2200 I ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nAB \u2217 C + AC \u2217 B = Atr(B \u2217 C) ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere x, x\u2032 = 1, 2 are doublet indices for the two SU (2)s. In this case, it is easy to see,\nusing the cyclic formula\n\nvalid for any real fields (as in (4.8)) in the bi-fundamental representation of SU (2)\u00d7SU (2).\nIn this case one finds that only the totally antisymmetric X 3 term survives and that\nc\n3\n,\nHAA\u2032 = (\u03a3IJK )AA\u2032 XIJK\n6\n\n(4.10)\n\n3\nwhere XIJK\n:= X[I XJ\u2217 XK] .\nIn the ABJM case the scalar field ZA is complex, in the four-dimensional spinor representation of SU (4), the spin group of SO(6). As it is complex it can also carry a U (1)\ncharge q with respect to the additional U (1) R-symmetry factor.

(4.16) can be rewritten as\n2b(\u03a3KLM \u03a3IJ )AB \u03beKLM B .\n\n(4.17)\n\nThe spinor \u03be can be expanded in terms of irreducible representations and we find that it\ncontains the thirty-six dimensional (201) representation that does not drop out of (4.15)\nand that cannot be absorbed in HI . So we again have to choose b = 0. On the other hand,\nthe c term is compatible with (4.15) for any choice of gauge group of the form G \u00d7 G\u2032 . One\nfinds\n1\nHI A = c(\u03b6I \u2212 \u03a3I \u03a3J \u03b6J )A ,\n4\n\n(4.18)\n\n1\n\u03b6I A := \u2212 (\u03a3I )BC ZB Z\u0304 A ZC .\n2\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere\n\n4.2\n\nCoupling to supergravity\n\nIn this section we consider the coupling of the matter-gauge systems to conformal supergravity. The idea is that we have to satisfy the Bianchi identities in the gravity and gauge\nsectors and the Ricci identity for the matter fields. For the ABJM case it turns out that\nthe parameter b must still be set equal to zero and that the scalar multiplet can be coupled\nto the off-shell superconformal geometry, while for the BLG case the situation is more\ncomplicated. There one can couple the scalar multiplet to on-shell conformal supergravity,\nbut only if the parameter b is non-zero.\n4.2.1\n\nN =6\n\nThe basic constraint on the scalar multiplet (4.11) is unchanged (although the derivative\nnow includes the geometrical connections), and the dimension-one components of the gauge\nfield strength tensors are also unaltered. However, the Ricci identity (4.12) is amended to\n\n\u2032\n[D\u03b1I , D\u03b2J ]ZA = i\u03b4IJ (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Da ZA \u2212 aF\u03b1I\u03b2J ZA + a\u2032 ZA F\u03b1I\u03b2J\n\u2212 iqG\u03b1I\u03b2J ZA \u2212 R\u03b1I\u03b2J,A B ZB ,\n(4.20)\nwhere q is the U (1) charge of the scalar field Z and the last term involves the SO(6)\ncurvature in the spin representation, RA B = 41 (\u03a3IJ )A B RIJ . The variation of \u039b is still given\nby (4.13), although the field Ha cannot be set to zero. We now want to investigate the Ricci\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fidentity on the scalar fields using the variation of the spinor, as before. The crucial terms\ncome from the M \u00d7 Z terms in the SO(6) and U (1) curvatures acting on Z. The key point\nis that these give rise to a composite object MIJ ZA , (where, for N = 6, MIJ is the SO(6)\ndual of the super Cotton tensor MIJKL ), which decomposes into (201)+ (011)+ (100). The\nmatter multiplet, as we discussed above, does contribute a term in the (201) when b 6= 0, as\ncan be seen from (4.16). However, MIJ can only be proportional to tr(Z\u03a3IJ Z \u2217 ) on-shell,\nwhereas (4.16) cannot be written in this form for any choice of gauge group G \u00d7 G\u2032 , not\neven for G = G\u2032 = SU (2). In the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) case one can use (4.9) to write (4.16) as\na sum of two terms involving traces. One of these has the correct form to be absorbed by\nMIJ ZA , but the other has the form tr(ZZ)Z \u2217 which cannot. We therefore conclude that\nb = 0 in the presence of conformal supergravity as well as in flat space.\nThis result means that the (201) representation in MIJ Z cannot be absorbed by the\nmatter sector and hence the two M Z terms in (4.20) must be arranged so that this term\ncancels between them. This requires the charge q to be \u2212 21 . With this choice the susy\nalgebra on the scalars closes provided that the H-functions in the variation of \u039b are chose\nto be\n1\nHaI A = LaIJ (\u03a3J Z)A \u2212 La JK (\u03a3IJK Z)A\n2\n1\n3i\n1\nHI A = KIJ (\u03a3J Z)A + c(\u03b6I \u2212 \u03a3I \u03a3J \u03b6J )A \u2212 i\u03bcI A + (\u03a3I \u03a3J \u03bcJ )A ,\n2\n4\n8\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere\nMIJ Z := \u03bc\u0302IJ + \u03a3[I \u03bcj] .\n\n(4.22)\n\nHere, \u03bc\u0302IJ denotes the (201), while \u03bcI is the sum of the other two representations, (011) and\n(100). Note that this does not require that the conformal supergravity sector is on-shell,\nalthough of course one will need to impose this to obtain the full equations of motion. This\nis done by taking MIJ to be proportional to tr(Z\u03a3IJ Z \u2217 ). The conclusion is therefore that\nthe N = 6 gauging of [10, 11] does not admit any further generalisation.\n4.2.2\n\nN =8\n\nThe situation is somewhat different in N = 8. We shall start with the closure of supersymmetry on the scalars, for which (4.2) is modified to\n\n\u2032\n[D\u03b1A , D\u03b2B ]XI = i\u03b4AB (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Da XI \u2212 aF\u03b1A\u03b2B XI + a\u2032 XI F\u03b1A\u03b2B\n\u2212 R\u03b1A\u03b2B,I J XJ ,\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhile the variation of the fermion is given in (4.3). We now find that there is a solution for\nthe H-fields in the variation of \u039b for the gauge group SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) with non-vanishing\nconformal supergravity provided that b 6= 0. Explicitly we find\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\f1 I B\n(\u03a3 )A\u2032 KAB XI +\n2\nc 3\n\u2212 XIJK\n6\n1\n= (\u2212(\u03a3I )AA\u2032 LaIJ XJ\n4\n\nHAA\u2032 =\n\nHaAA\u2032\n\nb I\n1\n(\u03a3 )AA\u2032 (tr(XI XJ\u2217 )XJ \u2212 trX 2 XI )\n2\n4\n\n1\n+ (\u03a3IJK )AA\u2032 LaIJ XK ) ,\n2\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhere trX 2 := tr(XI XI\u2217 ). The b term in HAA\u2032 can be absorbed by the geometry provided\nthat we choose\n1\n(4.25)\nCIJ = 8b(tr(XI XJ\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b4IJ trX 2 ) ,\n8\nwhere CIJ is the super Cotton tensor for N = 8. (Its relation to MABCD is described in\nAppendix D.) It might be thought that the terms in (4.24) involving KAB and LaBC could\nbe ignored since their leading components can be gauged away (see Appendix D), but this\nis not correct because the spinorial derivatives of these fields include terms involving the\ngravitino field strength and the field \u03bbABC (the dimension three-halves component of the\nsuper Cotton multiplet). In particular, the latter turns out to be (using (D.18))\n1\n14ib\n(tr(XI \u039b\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03a3IJ tr(XJ \u039b\u2217 )) .\n(4.26)\n3\n7\nThis essentially solves the problem in superspace. It is tedious, but straightforward,\nto verify that the supersymmetry algebra closes on \u039b and to obtain as a bi-product the\nequation of motion for the spinor field. It is\n\u03bbI = \u2212\n\nb\n\u03b3 a Da \u039b = \u2212 (2\u03a3IJ tr(\u039bXI )XJ + 10tr(\u039bXI )XI \u2212 trX 2 \u039b)\n4\n1\n3\n+c\u03a3IJ XI \u039bXJ \u2212 \u03a3I \u03a8XI + LaIJ \u03b3 a \u03a3IJ \u039b\n4\n4\n\n(4.27)\n\nFrom this one finds the pure scalar terms in the scalar equation of motion to be\n1\nD a Da XI = b2 (3tr(XI XJ )tr(XJ XK )XK \u2212 trX 2 tr(XI XJ )XJ \u2212 tr(XJ XK )tr(XJ XK )XI +\n2\n3\n3\n+ (trX 2 )2 XI ) + 2c2 XJ XIJK\nXK .\n(4.28)\n16\nThe last term can be rewritten in terms of traces if desired. This corresponds to a potential\nthat is proportional to\n\n2\n\nV (X) \u221d b\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n1\ntr(XI XJ ) tr(XI XK ) tr(XJ XK ) \u2212 trX 2 tr(XI XJ ) tr(XI XJ ) + (trX 2 )3\n2\n4\n48\n\n3\n3\n\u2212c2 tr(XIJK\nXIJK\n).\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.29)\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fFor the geometrical sector the general analysis given in appendix D shows that we\nhave a complete solution of the Bianchi identities provided that the field MABCD satisfies\n(D.9) (with the indices replaced by A, B etc and with \u03bb5 being the dual of \u03bb3 ). That this\nis so is easily verified from (4.25) and (4.1). For the gauge sector we have already shown\nthat the Bianchi identities are satisfied given (4.4) and (4.1). The dimension three-halves\ncomponents are given by (4.5) and (4.6). The dimension-two components are given by\ni\nFab = \u2212\u03b5ab c (XI Dc XI\u2217 \u2212 Dc XI XI\u2217 + \u039bA\u2032 \u03b3c \u039b\u2217A\u2032 )\n2\ni\n\u2032\nFab\n= \u2212\u03b5ab c (XI\u2217 Dc XI \u2212 Dc XI\u2217 XI + \u039b\u2217A\u2032 \u03b3c \u039bA\u2032 ) .\n2\n\n(4.30)\n\nThe equations derived above are covariant under super-Weyl transformations, although\nthis is not manifest. A discussion of this topic can be found in Appendix D.\n4.3\n\nN = 8 models with SO(N ) gauge groups\n\nIn the N = 8 modification of BLG we have seen that setting b = 0 immediately implies\nthat the background has to be superconformally flat, because CIJ and hence all of the field\nstrengths in the super Cotton tensor must vanish. On the other hand one can set c = 0\nwithout getting a free model. If the gauge group is SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) this means that the two\nChern-Simons terms in the spacetime Lagrangian have equal magnitudes and signs. They\ncan therefore be rewritten as a single SO(4) Chern-Simons term. It turns out, as we shall\nnow show, that this model can be generalised to an SO(N ) gauge group for any N .\nWe now take the scalar field XIr , r = 1, . . . N to transform under the vector representation of SO(N ) as well as SO(8). Then (4.23) becomes\nrs\n[D\u03b1A , D\u03b2B ]XIr = i\u03b4AB (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Da XI \u2212 aF\u03b1A\u03b2B\nXIs \u2212 R\u03b1A\u03b2B,I J XJr ,\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhile in (4.2) both X and \u039b carry an extra SO(n) vector index and (4.4) is replaced by\nrs\n= i(\u03a3IJ )AB XIr XJs .\nF\u03b1A\u03b2B\n\n(4.32)\n\nWe then find that the supersymmetry algebra closes on the scalars if we take\n1\nCIJ = 8a(tr(XI XJ ) \u2212 \u03b4IJ trX 2 )\n8\n\n(4.33)\n\na\n1\n1\nHAA\u2032 = (\u03a3I )A\u2032 B KAB XI + (\u03a3I )AA\u2032 (tr(XI XJ ) \u2212 \u03b4IJ trX 2 )XJ .\n2\n2\n4\n\n(4.34)\n\nand\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main goal of this paper has been to derive the possible topologically gauged M2-brane\ntheories with six and eight supersymmetries. We have done this by combining results from\nthree different methods, partly from expediency and partly because the different approaches\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\filluminate different aspects of the problem with the results appearing in a different orders.\nClearly each of these methods, Noether, algebraic on-shell supersymmetry and superspace,\nwould by itself provide a complete and consistent way to derive any of the topologically\ngauged theories discussed in this paper.\nIn the case of N = 6 supersymmetry we have shown rigorously that there are no further\npossibilities for topological gauging of the ABJM models beyond those that have already\nappeared in the literature [10, 11]. On the other hand, for N = 8, we have seen that\nthe gauged BLG theory can accommodate an extra interaction in the presence of gravity\nprovided that the coefficients of the two SU (2) Chern-Simons terms no longer have the\nsame magnitude. When the standard BLG sextic potential is switched off this results in a\nnew interacting theory with a single SO(4) Chern-Simons term. Furthermore, this model\ncan be extended to arbitrary SO(N ) gauge groups. Note, however, that for special values\nof the parameters in the deformed BLG the SO(4) is reduced to SO(3).\nOne general feature of these topologically gauged theories is the appearance of new\nterms in the scalar potential. If evaluated for a single scalar field vacuum expectation\nvalue v, the new potential picks up a non-zero value V (v) which implies that all these\ntheories have AdS3 vacuum solutions of various kinds. In the N = 6 cases considered in\n[10, 11] the resulting topologically massive supergravity theory ended up at the chiral point\ncorresponding to that discussed by Li, Song and Strominger in [12]. However, the theories\nwith eight supersymmetries obtained in this paper have different solutions depending on\nhow many scalar fields are given the VEV v. As explained in section 2, in this way we\nfind both critical AdS3 backgrounds and critical warped AdS3 ones corresponding to those\ndiscussed in [13].\nThe interpretation of these new models in terms of membranes is not immediately\napparent. We have argued in the introduction that they might correspond to branes in the\ncontext of AdS/CFT with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions as suggested in\n[7]. It would be interesting to study whether this tentative identification can be established\nwith more certainty.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Martin Cederwall and Jelle Hartong for discussions and Nordita\nand the organisers of the programme \"Geometry of strings and fields\" where part of this\nwork was carried out.

Form\n\u03b41 = \u01ed\u03b11 D\u03b1 and the same for the second one, and construct the commutator. We find that\n[\u03b41 , \u03b42 ] = i\u01ed1 \u03b3 a \u01eb2 Da .\n\n(A.4)\n\nNow we compute the same commutator from the transformation rules of the component\nfields in the Noether and algebraic approaches. Using\n\u03b4Xai = i\u01ed\u0393i \u03c8a , \u03b4\u03c8a = \u0393i \u03b3 \u03bc \u01ebD\u03bc Xai ,\n\n(A.5)\n\n(note the order of the gamma matrices in \u03b4\u03c8a which makes it valid in both component\napproaches) we find that\n[\u03b41 , \u03b42 ] = \u22122i\u01ed1 \u03b3 \u03bc \u01eb2 D\u03bc .\n(A.6)\n\nThe difference in the factor of \"2\" is clear since it is taken care of by the factor of 12 in the\n\u221a\nsuperspace approach, A in the Noether approach and the 2 in the algebraic approach.\nThe sign difference on the other hand is correct since the derivative and field realizations\nshould give susy algebras with different signs on the right hand side.\nA.3\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u03b3 \u03bc , \u0393i ) versus \u0393M = (\u0393\u03bc , \u0393I ) versus (\u03b3 a , (\u03a3I )A A )\n\nIn the Noether and superspace approaches the 3d gamma matrices commute with the 8d\nones, while in the algebraic approach they anti-commute. These choices are not significant\nand could have been done differently in each case. In the title of this subsection the matrices\nused in the three approaches are given in the order Noether, algebraic, and superspace.\nThere is also some notational differences for the SO(8) gamma matrices. In the component\napproaches one uses \u0393i , with i an SO(8) vector index, which in superspace is replaced by\n\u03a3I and \u03a3\u0304I , now with I as the vector index. One can check that the Clifford algebra in this\ncase allows for two different kinds of gamma matrices. While the metric in spinor space\nmust be symmetric the \u0393i matrices themselves can be either symmetric or antisymmetric.\nThe Noether approach uses antisymmetric \u0393i matrices but in the superspace approach this\nis not an issue since only the 8 \u00d7 8 blocks \u03a3I and \u03a3\u0304I appear. If needed the relation between\nthe gamma matrices is\n!\nI\n0\n\u03a3\n\u0393i =\n,\n\u03a3\u0304I 0\nwhere \u03a3\u0304I = \u2212\u03a3I while in superspace it is understood that if needed \u03a3\u0304I = \u03a3I is used.\nNote that the chirality of the R-symmetry spinors is explicit in the superspace conventions\n\u2032\nwhere the gamma matrices are often written with spinor indices as (\u03a3I )A A .\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fB\n\nCancellation of \u01eb\u03c8 3 X in the Noether approach\n\nOne interesting term to check here is \u01eb\u03c8 3 X without a structure constant.

For example the \u0393-matrices are 11dimensional, and using the chirality properties of \u01eb, we get\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1 \u01eb\n\n(C.1)\n\nfor dualizing \u0393-matrices with three-dimensional indices (same sign for acting on \u03c7\u03bc , opposite sign when acting on \u03a8a ).

As can be seen from (3.5) this term does not\nrepresent symmetries of the theory and it must therefore vanish. As a consistency check\nwe note that all terms containing the three-algebra structure constants cancel against\neach other, just as in the BLG analysis [3]. There are three different gamma-structures\nrepresented by the ellipses in (3.6). The ones with two and six SO(8) gamma matrices,\nwhich contain just one type of term each, combine via duality to give\n\u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b14 + 4\u03b15 \u2212 2\u03b16 \u2212 \u03b17 \u2212 18 \u03b34 \u2212 12 \u03b35 = 0 .\n\n(C.5)\n\nThe terms coming with four SO(8) gamma matrices contain two independent structures\nwith respect to the three-algebra indices. One of these structures further split into three\nindependent terms which, however, give rise to the same equation. In this way we get\n\u2212 2\u03b16 + \u03b17 = 0 ,\n\n\u03b13 + 2\u03b14 \u2212 4\u03b15 \u2212 2\u03b16 \u2212 \u03b17 \u2212 81 \u03b34 + 21 \u03b35 = 0 .\n\n(C.6)\n\nWe can now combine the equations and summarize the constraints from the \u0393(5) term in\n(3.6) as\n\n\u2212\u03b14 + 2\u03b15 \u2212\n\n\u03b13\n1\n16 \u03b34\n\n\u2212 2\u03b17 = 0 ,\n\n\u2212 41 \u03b35 = 0 ,\n\n(C.7)\n\n\u22122\u03b16 + \u03b17 = 0 .\n\nWe now turn to the \u0393(1) term in (3.6).

The interpretation\nof the dimension-one fields, K, L, M , is as follows. The geometry is determined by the\nbasic constraint (D.1) which is invariant under Weyl rescalings where the parameter is an\nunconstrained scalar superfield. This means that some of the fields that appear in the\ngeometry do not belong to the conformal supergravity multiplet. At dimension one K and\nL are of this type, so that we could set them to zero if we were only interested in the\nsuperconformal multiplet. The field MIJKL , on the other hand, can be considered as the\nfield strength superfield for the conformal supergravity multiplet [22]. Similarly, at dimension three-halves, the fields \u03bbIJK and \u03bbIJKLM are components of the Cotton superfield,\nwhile \u03c3, \u03c1 and \u03c7 are like K and L in that their leading components can be removed by\nsuper-Weyl transformations [22\u201324]. It is easy to see that these fields correspond to the \u03b8 3\ncomponents of a scalar superfield.\nThe fact that M is not expressible in terms of the torsion is due to a lacuna in Dragon's\ntheorem [24, 26] which in higher-dimensional spacetimes states that the curvature is so\ndetermined [35]. We recall that in three-dimensional spacetime there is no Weyl tensor\nbut that its place is taken by the dimension-three Cotton tensor. This turns out to be a\ncomponent of the field MIJKL so that we could refer to the latter as the super Cotton tensor.\nUsing the notation [k, l] to denote fields that have k antisymmetrised SO(N ) indices and\nl symmetrised spinor indices, one can see that the component fields of the superconformal\nmultiplet fall into two sequences starting from MIJKL [25]. The first has fields of the type\n[4 \u2212 p, p], where the top ([4, 0]) component is the supersymmetric Cotton tensor, while the\nsecond has fields of the type (4 + p, p) and therefore includes higher spin fields for N > 8.\nThere is also a second scalar [4, 0] at dimension two. Fields with two or more spinor indices\nobey covariant conservation conditions so that each field in the multiplet has two degrees\nof freedom multiplied by the dimension of the SO(N ) representation, provided that we\ncount the dimension one and two scalars together. It is easy to see that the number of\n\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n\fbosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in this multiplet match. Diagrammatically, we\nhave the following picture:\n\n[4,0]\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[5,1]\n\u2720\n\n[6,2]\n\n[3,1]\n\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[4,0]\n\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n[2,2]\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[7,3]\n\n[1,3]\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[0,4]\nFigure 1\n\nThe dimension of the top field (i.e. MIJKL ) is one and thereafter the dimension\nincreases stepwise by one-half as one goes down the diagram. The spins of the fields are\ngiven by the second entry divided by two. For N < 4 the top field will be the one with\nN internal indices; for example, in N = 3 it will be the dimension three-halves field [3, 1].\nThe right sequence clearly terminates at [0, 4] but the left sequences can continue to higher\nspin for N > 8. The fields [2, 2], [3, 1] and [0, 4] are the SO(N ) gauge field strength, the\nsupersymmetric partner of the Cotton tensor (Cottino), and the Cotton tensor respectively.\nIn the case of N = 6 there is an additional U (1) fields strength [6, 2] that plays a key r\u00f4le in\nthe ABJM model. It is therefore permissible in this case to introduce a new field strength\ntwo-form G that satisfies an abelian Bianchi, dG = 0. At dimension one we can take\nG\u03b1I\u03b2J = i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 MIJ ,\n\n(D.10)\n\nwhere MIJ := 4!1 \u03b5IJKLM N M KLM N is the dual of the four-index scalar appearing in the\ndimension-one SO(6) curvature. The dimension three-halves Bianchi identity for G then\nimplies that\nD\u03b1I MJK = 2i\u03b4I[J \u03bb\u03b1K] + 3i\u03bb\u0303\u03b1IJK ,\n\n(D.11)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0303IJK is the dual of \u03bbIJK and \u03bbI is the dual of \u03bbIJKLM . Indeed, (D.11) is equivalent\nto (D.9) for N = 6. The dimension three-halves component of G is\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\fGa\u03b2J = \u2212i(\u03b3a \u03bbJ )\u03b2 .\n\n(D.12)\n\nIn N = 8 one can impose a duality condition on the dimension-one scalar fields that\nhalves the multiplet; the fields in the left sequence become the duals of those in the right\nsequence. The dimension-two scalar fields also obey a duality constraint but it is opposite\nto that for the dimension-one scalars. A consequence of this is that there is no off-shell\nLagrangian for the N = 8 theory.\nIn addition, in N = 8 we can take the R-symmetry group to be Spin(8) rather than\nSO(8) [26, 34]. It turns out that this is the correct choice in order to describe the theories we\nare interested in, and so we shall switch to this for the remainder of the paper. We denote\nthe spinor indices by A, B, . . . ((0010) representation) and A\u2032 .B \u2032 . . . ((0001) representation),\nwhile we keep I, J, . . . for the vector representation (1000). All three types of index can\ntake 8 values. So for N = 8 we shall take the basis odd one-forms to be E \u03b1A , and in\nthe above formulae for the components of the torsion and curvature tensors replace all the\ninternal vector indices by unprimed spinorial ones.\nThe super Cotton tensor MABCD will be chosen to be self-dual, i.e. in the representation (2000), which is equivalent to a symmetric traceless second-rank tensor denoted by\nCIJ :\nMABCD =\n\n1 IK\n(\u03a3 )[AB (\u03a3J K )CD] CIJ ,\n16\n\n(D.13)\n\nor, inverting,\n1\n(\u03a3IK )AB (\u03a3J K )CD M ABCD .\n(D.14)\n24\nFurthermore, we can relate the algebra indices on the curvature in three eight-dimensional\nrepresentations by means of \u03a3-matrices:\nCIJ =\n\nRAB =\n\n1 IJ\n(\u03a3 )AB RIJ ;\n4\n\n1\nRA\u2032 B \u2032 = (\u03a3IJ )A\u2032 B \u2032 RIJ .\n4\n\n(D.15)\n\nInverting, we have\n1\n1\n\u2032 \u2032\n(D.16)\nRIJ = (\u03a3IJ )AB RAB = (\u03a3IJ )A B RA\u2032 B \u2032 .\n4\n4\nClearly similar formulae apply to any second-rank anti-symmetric tensors, such as LaIJ .\nThe dimension three-halves curvatures and relations are given by equations (D.5) to\n(D.9) but with I, J, K, .. replaced by A, B, C. The five-index \u03bb spinor is the dual of \u03bbABC\nmultiplied by a factor of 1/3. The field \u03bbABC can also be written as a \u03a3-traceless primed\nvector-spinor \u03bbIA\u2032 , with\n1\n\u03bbIA\u2032 = \u2212 (\u03a3J )A\u2032 A (\u03a3IJ )BC \u03bbABC ,\n3\n\n(D.17)\n\nand it is easy to check that\n\u03bb\u03b1IA\u2032 =\n\ni\n(\u03a3J )A\u2032 A D\u03b1A CIJ .\n15\n\n\u2013 40 \u2013\n\n(D.18)\n\n\fFor the Yang-Mills sector there is a similar off-shell multiplet which is relevant to the\nsuperconformal case, i.e. the Chern-Simons Lagrangian. The (0, 2) component of the field\nstrength two-form F is taken to be [27]\nF\u03b1I\u03b2J = i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 WIJ ,\n\n(D.19)\n\nwhere WIJ , which is in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, is antisymmetric\non its SO(N ) indices (and we assume N \u2265 2). The lowest-order Bianchi identity will be\nsatisfied if\n2\n\u03b4 DLW\n,\n(D.20)\nN \u2212 1 I[J \u03b1 K]L\nwhere the derivative is now covariant with respect to the gauge group as well as the\ngeometry. The multiplet described by this constraint is rather similar to the super Cotton\nmultiplet. Its independent components can be represented by a similar diagram with top\nvertex given by a field [2, 0] which is the leading component of WIJ :\nD\u03b1I WJK = D\u03b1[I WJK] \u2212\n\n[2,0]\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[3,1]\n\u2720\n\n[4,2]\n\n[1,1]\n\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n[2,0]\n\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n[0,2]\n\n\u2720\n\nFigure 2\nThe fields on the right diagonal terminate at [0, 2], i.e. Fab , while the fields on the\nleft diagonal generically involve higher-spin components that obey covariant divergence\nconstraints. This multiplet is off-shell but can only be used to construct an off-shell Lagrangian for the cases N = 2, 3, 4 (with self-duality imposed for the latter), but not for\nthe cases we are interested in. (Although there is an off-shell version of Chern-Simons\ngauge theory in N = 6 harmonic superspace [36]; for other discussions of Chern-Simons\ntheories in harmonic superspaces, including ABJM in N = 3 harmonic superspace, see e.g.\n[37, 38].)\nD.2\n\nCompleteness of the solution\n\nIt is easy enough to see at the linearised level that the components in the Cotton superfield\nwith spins \u2265 1, i.e. two or more symmetrised spinor indices, must also obey conservation\nconditions which must become covariant conservation constraints in the full theory because\notherwise the degrees of freedom account would go astray. This has not been verified\ndirectly, however, except for the Cottino and Cotton tensors in the case of N = 8. What\ncan be said, however, is that there are no more constraints coming from higher-dimensional\nBianchi identities, and that we therefore have a complete solution to these equations, even\nfor N > 8.\n\n\u2013 41 \u2013\n\n\fWe can show this making use of the idea which is based on the fact that the Bianchi\nidentities themselves obey identities even when they are not satisfied [39].15 These are\nDI = 0 :\n\nDI A = \u2212E B IB A ;\n\nDIA B = 0 ,\n\n(D.21)\n\nwhere I , I A and IA B are respectively the Bianchi identities for the Yang-Mills field strength,\nthe torsion and the curvature, and where we have made use of the Ricci identity, D 2 \u223c\nF + R. The idea now is to show that when a subset of the Bianchi identities have been\nsatisfied then the other, higher-dimensional ones automatically are by virtue of (D.21). For\nthis we shall need to use a little bit of superspace cohomology. The basic idea is that a\ngiven n-form can be split into (p, n \u2212 p) bi-degrees where the pair (p, q) denotes the number of even (odd) indices on a particular component, with increasing p corresponding to\nincreasing mass dimension. Moreover, the exterior derivative d splits into components with\nbi-degrees (\u22121, 2), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (2, \u22121). The first of these, denoted t0 , has dimension\nzero and is purely algebraic. On a (p, q) form it operates by contracting one of the even\nindices with the vector index on the dimension-zero torsion and then by symmetrising over\nthe q + 2 odd indices thereby giving a form of bi-degree (p \u2212 1, q + 2). It squares to zero and\nis thus associated with its own cohomology Htp.q [40]. It is the only one we shall need in\nthe following. Suppose we have an equation of the form d\u03c9 = 0 where \u03c9 is an n-form, and\nsuppose that the lowest non-vanishing component of \u03c9 is \u03c9p,q . Then the lowest non-trivial\ncomponent of d\u03c9 = 0 is t0 \u03c9p,q = 0, and is thus purely algebraic. We shall always assume\nthat the dimension-zero torsion is as given in (D.1) and so solving this equation is the same\nas in flat superspace. In three dimensions, for N > 2, the key fact is that Htp,q = 0 for\np > 0. This can be seen via dimensional reduction [41, 42] or directly in three dimensions\n[43].\nA simple example is given by the Yang-Mills case. Suppose that we have solved the\nlowest-dimensional component, i.e. I0,3 = 0. Then DI = 0 implies that t0 I1,2 = 0. Since\nHt1,2 = 0, we must have I1,2 = t0 J2,0 , so that solving this Bianchi identity component by\nsetting J2,0 = 0 simply allows one to solve for F2,0 in terms of the lower-dimensional fields.\nThen with I1,2 = 0 similar arguments show that I2,1 = I3,0 = 0, in other words, a complete\nsolution to the identities is guaranteed if I0,3 = 0, i.e. if (D.20) holds.\nFor the geometry, we shall suppose that the torsion Bianchi identities have been solved\nup to dimension three-halves, so that the torsion and dimension-one curvatures have the\nform given above. (The dimensions of the (p, q) components of the identities are given by\n(p + q/2) \u2212 k where k = 1, 1/2, 0 for I a , I \u03b1 , IA B respectively, where \u03b1 denotes a combined\nspinor-internal index.) Furthermore, the dimension three-halves field strengths are determined in terms of derivatives of the dimension-one fields. Using the second of equations\n(D.21) one can show that the dimension three-halves identity I0,3 ab must be identically\nsatisfied, although this is not true for I0,3 IJ . The remaining condition that comes from\nthis identity component is the constraint on the derivative of the super Cotton tensor (D.9).\nWe can now use the third equation in (D.21) to show that the dimension-two components\nof IA B , namely I1,2 ab and I1,2 IJ , are solved by specifying the (2, 0) Lorentz and SO(N )\n15\n\nWe assume here that N > 4 although only minor modifications are needed for the other cases.\n\n\u2013 42 \u2013\n\n\fcurvature components in terms of derivatives and bilinears in the dimension-one fields, as\nin the Yang-Mills case. The second of equations (D.21) can then be used to show that the\ntorsion identities are identically satisfied at dimension-two, and it is a simple matter to\nconfirm that there are no new conditions arising at dimension five-halves, again with the\naid of (D.21).\nThe upshot of this analysis is that all of the non-zero components of the torsion and\ncurvature tensors are determined as functions of the independent dimension-one fields K, L\nand M and their derivatives, and that the super Cotton tensor satisfies the constraint (D.9).\nD.3\n\nSuper-Weyl covariance\n\nThe modified BLG theory given above couples the superconformal geometry to the N =\n8 matter system which is superconformal in the flat space limit. We therefore expect\nthe combined system to be invariant under super-Weyl transformations as well as superdiffeomorphisms, but this is not manifest in the formalism. In this subsection we show that\nthe Dirac equation (4.27) is indeed super-Weyl covariant in that it scales homogeneously\nunder super-Weyl transformations.\nThe latter can be defined as follows. For any variation of the supervielbein and connections we define\nHA B = EA M \u03b4EM B\n\u03a6A = EA M \u03b4\u03a9M ,\n\n(D.22)\n\nwhere \u03a9M is either the Lorentz or SO(8) connection. The variation of the torsion is given\nby\n\u03b4TAB C = 2D[A HB] C \u2212 TAB D HD C \u2212 2H[A D T|D|B]C + 2\u03a6[A,B] C ,\n\n(D.23)\n\nwhere the antisymmetrisation brackets are graded. In order to preserve the constraints on\nthe torsion under a super-Weyl transformation with parameter an unconstrained superfield\nS we must take\nH\u03b1A \u03b2B = \u2212\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b4A B S\n\n;\n\nHa \u03b2B = \u22122i(\u03b3a )\u03b2\u03b3 D\u03b3B S ,\n\nHa b = \u22122\u03b4a b S\n(D.24)\n\nand, for the connections,\n\u03a6\u03b1A,bc = 2(\u03b3bc )\u03b1 \u03b2 D\u03b2A S\n\u03a6\u03b1A,BC = \u22124\u03b4A[B D\u03b1C] S\n\u03a6a,bc = 4\u03b7a[b Dc] S\n2\n\u03a6a,BC = 2iDaBC\nS,\n\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\n(D.25)\n\n\fwhere\ni\n2\n2\nD\u03b1A D\u03b2B S = \u03b4AB (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Da S + \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 DAB\nS + (\u03b3 a )\u03b1\u03b2 DaAB\nS\n(D.26)\n2\ndefines the second-order derivatives which are respectively symmetric and anti-symmetric\non their SO(8) indices.

For the matter fields we have\n\n\u03b4\u03c6I = S\u03c6I\n\u03b4\u039b\u03b1A\u2032 = 2S\u039b\u03b1A\u2032 \u2212 i((\u03a3I )AA\u2032 D\u03b1A S)\u03c6I ,\n\n(D.28)\n\nand we take the one-form gauge potentials to be invariant, so that the components with\nrespect to a preferred basis transform only because of the supervielbein factors. In order\nto compute the super-Weyl variation of the Dirac equation we also need the variation of\nthe gravitino field strength \u03a8 We have\nTab \u03b3C := \u03b5abc \u03a8c\u03b3C\n\n(D.29)\n\n\u03a8a :=: \u03a8\u0302a + \u03b3a \u03a8\n\n(D.30)\n\nand we set\n\nin terms of irreducible Lorentz representations.
