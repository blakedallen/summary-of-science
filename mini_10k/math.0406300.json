INTRODUCTION\nRecall that the irrationality exponent \u03bc (\u03b1 ) of an irrational number \u03b1 is defined\nin terms of the irrationality measure 1 q \u03bc . Using 1 \u03b2 q instead, we introduce a weaker\nmeasure of irrationality, the irrationality base \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) , as follows. If there exists a real\nnumber \u03b2 \u2265 1 with the property that for any \u03b5 > 0 there is a positive integer q(\u03b5 ) such\nthat\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\n1\np\n>\n,\nq ( \u03b2 + \u03b5 )q\n\nfor all integers p, q , with q \u2265 q (\u03b5 ) , then the least such \u03b2 is called the irrationality base\n\u03b2 (\u03b1 ) of \u03b1 .\nThe motivation for using the irrationality measure 1 \u03b2 q , rather than some other\nfunction of q, is the following. In [6] we gave criteria for irrationality of Euler's constant,\n\u03b3 , involving the Beukers-type double integral\n\nIn :\n\n\u222b\u222b\n\n[ 0,1]2\n\nwhere\n\n\u2212\n\n( x (1 \u2212 x ) y (1 \u2212 y)) n\n2n\ndx dy = \uf8eb\uf8ed \uf8f6\uf8f8 \u03b3 + L n \u2212 An ,\nn\n(1 \u2212 x y) log x y\n\nd2 n L n \u2208 Z ln(n + 1) + Z ln(n + 2) + \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 + Z ln(2 n)\n\n\f2\nand d2 n An \u2208 Z , with d n denoting the least common multiple of the numbers 1, 2, . . ., n .\n\nIn particular, we showed that \u03b3 is irrational if the fractional part of d2 n L n exceeds 2 \u2212n\ninfinitely often. In a paper in preparation, we prove that a stronger condition implies a\nmeasure of irrationality for \u03b3 . Namely, if\n(C)\n\nlim\n\nn \u2192\u221e\n\nln || d2 n L n ||\nn\n\n= 0,\n\nwhere || t || denotes the distance from t to the nearest integer, then the estimates as n \u2192 \u221e\nI n = 4 \u2212 2 n (1+ o(1)) ,\n\n\uf8eb 2 n\uf8f6 = 2 2 n(1+ o(1)) ,\n\uf8ed n\uf8f8\n\nd 2 n = e 2 n (1+ o(1))\n\nimply that for any \u03b5 > 0 there exists q(\u03b5 ) > 0 such that\n\n\u03b3 \u2212\n\n1\np\n>\n,\nq (2e + \u03b5 )q\n\nfor all integers p, q , with q \u2265 q (\u03b5 ) ; in other words, the irrationality base of \u03b3 satisfies\nthe inequality \u03b2 (\u03b3 ) \u2264 2e = 5.436 . . . . We also show that a condition similar to (C), but\nbased on an integral for ln(\u03c0 2) [7], implies that ln \u03c0 is irrational and \u03b2 (ln \u03c0 ) \u2264 2 .\nMoreover, we present numerical evidence for both conditions. These results suggest that\nit would be interesting to study the new irrationality measure 1 \u03b2 q by itself.\nIn Section 2 we define irrationality measures, exponents, and bases. In Section 3\nwe prove formulas for \u03bc (\u03b1 ) and \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) in terms of the continued fraction expansion of\n\u03b1 , and compute several examples. The formulas yield bounds on \u03bc (\u03b1 ) and \u03b2 (\u03b1 )\ninvolving the Fibonacci numbers, as well as a growth condition on the partial quotients of\n\u03b1 implying \u03bc (\u03b1 ) = 2 , and a weaker condition implying \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = 1. In Section 4 we\nobserve that the existence of numbers with prescribed irrationality measure follows from\nV. Jarn\u00edk's 1931 construction of continued fractions with certain Diophantine\napproximation properties [3]. In the final section, we use a different method to construct\nexplicitly series with prescribed irrationality base. The two methods yield numbers with\nthe same irrationality base but different approximation properties.\n2. IRRATIONALITY MEASURES, EXPONENTS, AND BASES\nAfter recalling the definitions of irrationality measure and irrationality exponent,\nwe introduce the notion of irrationality base. Throughout this section and the next, \u03b1\ndenotes a fixed but arbitrary irrational number.\nDefinition 1. An irrationality measure is a function f ( x, \u03bb ) , defined for x \u2265 1 and \u03bb > 0 ,\nwhich takes values in the positive reals and is strictly decreasing in both x and \u03bb . If there\nexists \u03bb > 0 with the property that for any \u03b5 > 0 there exists a positive integer q(\u03b5 ) such\nthat\n\n\f3\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\np\n> f (q, \u03bb + \u03b5 ) ,\nq\n\nfor all integers p , q , with q \u2265 q (\u03b5 ) ,\n\nthen we denote by \u03bb (\u03b1 ) the least such \u03bb , and we say that \u03b1 has irrationality measure\nf ( x, \u03bb (\u03b1 )) . Otherwise, if no such \u03bb exists, we write \u03bb (\u03b1 ) = \u221e .\nDefinition 2. Let f ( x, \u03bb ) = x \u2212 \u03bb . If \u03b1 has irrationality measure f ( x, \u03bc ) = x \u2212 \u03bc for some\n\u03bc = \u03bc (\u03b1 ) , then \u03bc (\u03b1 ) \u2208 [ 2, \u221e) is called the irrationality exponent of \u03b1 . If there is no\nsuch \u03bc , then we write \u03bc (\u03b1 ) = \u221e and we call \u03b1 a Liouville number.\nRemark. Our definition of irrationality exponent is equivalent to the one in [2, p. 106],\nbut our definition of irrationality measure differs from that in [2, p. 17].\nDefinition 3. Let f ( x, \u03bb ) = \u03bb\u2212 x . If \u03b1 has irrationality measure f ( x, \u03b2 ) = \u03b2 \u2212 x for some\n\u03b2 = \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) (so that \u03b2 is the smallest number with the property that for any \u03b5 > 0 there\nexists q(\u03b5 ) > 0 such that\n(1)\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\n1\np\n>\n,\nq (\u03b2 + \u03b5 ) q\n\nfor all integers p, q , with q \u2265 q (\u03b5 ) ),\n\nthen we call \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) \u2208 [1, \u221e) the irrationality base of \u03b1 . Otherwise, if no such \u03b2 exists,\nwe write \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = \u221e and we say that \u03b1 is a super Liouville number.\nExample 1. The sum of the following series is a super Liouville number:\n1 1\n1\nS = + 1 + 1 +\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 .\n1 2\n42\n\nProof. If we write S = \u2211 n \u22651 b n\u22121 , where b1 = 1 and b n = (2 n ) n \u22121 , for n > 1, then the nth\npartial sum of the series equals a n b n , for some integer a n , and we have\nb\n\n0<S\u2212\n\nan\nbn\n\n<\n\n2\nb n +1\n\n=\n\n2\n(2\n\nn +1 b n\n\n)\n\n<\n\n1\nn bn\n\n(2 )\n\n<\n\n1\n,\nb n2\n\nn \u2265 2.\n\nBy the last bound, S is irrational. By the next-to-last bound, no number \u03b2 can satisfy the\nrequirements of Definition 3 with \u03b1 = S . So \u03b2 ( S ) = \u221e .\n\u2022\nWriting inequality (1) as\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\np\n> q \u2212 q log( \u03b2 + \u03b5 ) / log q\nq\n\n\f4\n\nin order to compare it with the irrationality measure q \u2212 \u03bc in Definition 2, we see that an\nupper bound on the irrationality base of a number is a much weaker condition than an\nupper bound on its irrationality exponent. In particular, we have the following\nproposition, which justifies the terminology in the last part of Definition 3.\nProposition 1. An irrational number which is not a Liouville number has irrationality\nbase one; equivalently, if \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) > 1, then \u03bc (\u03b1 ) = \u221e . In particular, a super Liouville\nnumber is also a Liouville number.\nProof. If \u03bc = \u03bc (\u03b1 ) is finite, then for any \u03b5 > 0 we have\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\np\n1\n1\n> \u03bc +\u03b5 >\n,\nq q\n(1 + \u03b5 ) q\n\nfor all integers p, q , with q > 0 sufficiently large, and so \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = 1. In particular,\n\u2022\n\u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = \u221e implies \u03bc (\u03b1 ) = \u221e .\nExample 2. The transcendental numbers ln 2 , e, \u03c0 , \u03b6 (2) , and the irrational number\n\u03b6 (3) , all have irrationality base one.\nProof. Upper bounds on their irrationality exponents are known [2, Chapter 2, \u00a7\u00a74, 5]. \u2022\nCorollary 1. An algebraic irrational number has irrationality base one.\nProof. This is a immediate from Liouville's theorem.\n\n\u2022\n\n3. FORMULAS FOR THE IRRATIONALITY EXPONENT AND BASE\nWe prove formulas for the irrationality exponent and base of an irrational number\n\u03b1 in terms of its continued fraction expansion. Then we give two corollaries and several\nexamples. The first corollary gives bounds on \u03bc (\u03b1 ) and \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) involving the Fibonacci\nnumbers. The second gives two growth conditions on the partial quotients of \u03b1 : one\nimplies that \u03bc (\u03b1 ) = 2 , and the other, weaker one that \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = 1.\nIn this section and the next, we will use the following two lemmas.\nLemma 1. (Legendre [5]) For integers p, q , with q > 0 , the inequality\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\np\n1\n< 2\nq\n2q\n\nimplies that p q is a convergent of the continued fraction expansion of \u03b1 .\nProof. See [4, p. 11].\n\n\u2022\n\n\f5\n\nLemma 2. For any real numbers C > 0, \u03bb > 1 there exists a positive integer\nq 0 = q 0 (C, \u03bb ) such that if p, q are integers satisfying the inequalities\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\np\nC\n\u2264 q,\nq\n\u03bb\n\nq \u2265 q0 ,\n\nthen p q is a convergent of \u03b1 .\nq0\n\nProof. By Lemma 1, it suffices to take q 0 so large that C \u03bb\n\n< 1 (2 q 02 ) .\n\n\u2022\n\nDenote a simple continued fraction by\n[b 0 ; b1, b 2 , . . .] = b 0 +\n\n1\n\n.\n\nb1 + 1\nb2 + \u22c5 \u22c5\n\n\u22c5\n\nTheorem 1. The irrationality exponent and irrationality base of an irrational number \u03b1\nwith continued fraction expansion \u03b1 = [b 0 ; b1, b 2 , . . .] and convergents pn qn are given\nby\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bc (\u03b1 ) = 1 + limsup\n\nln q n +1\n\nn \u2192\u221e\n\nln \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) = limsup\n\nln q n\n\n= 2 + limsup\n\nln q n +1\nqn\n\nn \u2192\u221e\n\nln b n +1\nln q n\n\nn \u2192\u221e\n\n= limsup\n\nln b n +1\n\nn \u2192\u221e\n\nqn\n\n,\n\n.\n\nRemark. The formulas in (2) for the irrationality exponent are probably known, but we\nhave not found a reference.\nProof. If we define \u03bb n by the equation\n(4)\n\n\u03b1\u2212\n\npn\n\u2212\u03bb\n= qn n ,\nqn\n\nthen the second of the inequalities [4, p. 8]\n(5)\n\n1\n1\np\n< \u03b1\u2212 n <\n2 q n q n +1\nqn\nq n q n +1\n\nimplies that \u03bb n > 2 .

Then\n(5) and Lemma 2 imply that limsup n\u2192\u221e \u03bb n = \u03b2 (\u03b1 ) , and (3) follows as did (2).\n\u2022\nExample 3. The golden mean \u03c6 = (1 + 5 ) / 2 has irrationality exponent 2 and\nirrationality base 1.\nProof. Here q n = Fn is asymptotic to \u03c6 n , and so \u03bc (\u03c6 ) = 1 + 1 = 2 and ln \u03b2 (\u03c6 ) = 0 .\n\n\u2022\n\nCorollary 2.

The\nsecond statement is immediate (note that 3 2 < \u03c6 ).\n\u2022\n\n4. PRESCRIBING IRRATIONALITY MEASURES\nVIA JARN\u00cdK'S THEOREM\nIn 1931, V. Jarn\u00edk proved a general result on simultaneous Diophantine\napproximation of s \u2265 1 numbers [3, Satz 6] (see also [1, p. 18, Exercise 1.5]). We recall\nthe statement for s = 1 and give his construction by continued fractions (Theorem 2). We\nthen point out that Jarn\u00edk's method produces numbers with prescribed irrationality\nmeasure (Theorem 3 and Corollary 4).\nIn the next section, bypassing Jarn\u00edk's method, we explicitly construct series with\nirrationality base any prescribed real number \u03b2 > 1 . As a preview of the two methods,\nhere are numbers with the same irrationality base but different approximation properties,\none a continued fraction and the other a series.\nExample 5. We have \u03b2 (\u03b8 2 ) = 2 for the continued fraction \u03b8 2 = [0; 3, 1, 2, 17, b5 , b6 , . . .] ,\nwhere b n+1 is related to the n-th convergent p n q n by the formula\n(9)\n\n\uf8ef 2 qn \uf8fa\nb n +1 = 1 + \uf8ef 2 \uf8fa .\n\uf8f0 qn \uf8fb\n\nIn particular, b5 = 1 + \uf8f02191 191 2 \uf8fb > 10 52 .\nProof. Taking \u03c9 ( x ) = 2 \u2212 x in Corollary 4 below, formula (9) satisfies conditions (10).\nExample 6. We have \u03b2 (\u03c4 2 ) = 2 for the series\n\n\u2022\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c42 =\n\n1 1\n1\n+ 2 + 2 +\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 .\n2 2\n22\n\nProof. Take \u03b2 = 2 in (12) below.\n\n\u2022\n\nRemark. Although the numbers in Examples 5 and 6 have the same irrationality base\n\u03b2 (\u03b8 2 ) = \u03b2 (\u03c4 2 ) = 2 , they have opposite approximation properties: for any integers p, q ,\nwith q > 0 sufficiently large, we will see that\n\n\u03b82 \u2212\n\np\n1\n< q,\nq\n2\n\n\u03c42 \u2212\n\np\n1\n> q.\nq\n2\n\nIn order to state Jarn\u00edk's theorem, we need a definition. (We use the terminology\nof [1, Chapter I, \u00a73].)\nDefinition 4. (Jarn\u00edk ) Given a real number \u03b8 and a real-valued function \u03c9 ( x ) , defined\nand positive for x \u2265 1, we say that \u03b8 is approximable to order \u03c9 if for every C > 0 there\nexists a pair of integers p, q , with q > C , such that\n\n\u03b8\u2212\n\np\n< \u03c9 (q) .\nq\n\nTheorem 2. (Jarn\u00edk) Suppose that the function \u03c9 ( x ) is defined for x \u2265 1, positive, and\ndecreasing, and that \u03c9 ( x ) = o( x \u22122 ) as x \u2192 \u221e . Then there exists an irrational number \u03b8\nwhich is approximable to order \u03c9 , but not to order c\u03c9 , for any constant 0 < c < 1.\nProof. (Sketch) Jarn\u00edk constructs a continued fraction by choosing the partial quotients\nb1, b 2 , . . . successively so that b n+1 is related to the nth convergent p n q n by the\nformulas\n(10)\n\nb n +1 \u03c9 (qn ) qn2 > 1 ,\n\nlim b n +1 \u03c9 (qn ) qn2 = 1 .\nn\u2192 \u221e\n\nThen he shows that any number \u03b8 = [0; b1, b 2 , . . .] which satisfies (10) also satisfies the\nconclusions of the theorem.\n\u2022\nThe following is a simple application of Jarn\u00edk's theorem.\nTheorem 3. Suppose that f ( x, \u03bb ) is an irrationality measure with a fixed value of \u03bb > 0\nsuch that f ( x, \u03bb ) = o( x \u22122 ) as x \u2192 \u221e . Suppose further that for any \u03b5 > 0 there exists a\npositive constant c = c(\u03b5 ) < 1 , independent of x, such that f ( x, \u03bb + \u03b5 ) < cf ( x, \u03bb ) , for x\nsufficiently large. Then there exists an irrational number \u03b8 \u03bb which has irrationality\nmeasure f ( x, \u03bb ) and is approximable to order \u03c9 ( x ) = f ( x, \u03bb ) .\n\n\f10\n\nRemark. Although an irrationality measure is strictly decreasing in both variables, the\nsecond hypothesis is not redundant, because c does not depend on x.\nProof. The function \u03c9 ( x ) = f ( x, \u03bb ) satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 2. Let \u03b8 \u03bb be a\nnumber satisfying the conclusions. Since f ( x, \u03bb ) , and thus \u03c9 ( x ) , is a decreasing function\nof x, and \u03b8 \u03bb approximable to order \u03c9 , it follows that \u03bb (\u03b8 \u03bb ) \u2265 \u03bb (in the notation of\nDefinition 1). To show that \u03bb (\u03b8 \u03bb ) \u2264 \u03bb , suppose on the contrary that \u03bb (\u03b8 \u03bb ) > \u03bb . Then\nthere exist \u03b5 > 0 and infinitely many integers p, q , with q > 0 , such that\n\n\u03b8\u03bb \u2212\n\np\n\u2264 f (q, \u03bb + \u03b5 ) < cf (q, \u03bb ) = c\u03c9 (q ) ,\nq\n\nfor some constant 0 < c < 1. But then \u03b8 \u03bb is approximable to order c\u03c9 , which is a\ncontradiction. Hence \u03bb (\u03b8 \u03bb ) = \u03bb and the result follows.\n\u2022\nCorollary 4. Every real number \u03b2 > 1 is the irrationality base of some number \u03b8 \u03b2 , which\n\nis approximable to order \u03b2 \u2212 x ; any continued fraction \u03b8 \u03b2 = [0; b1, b 2 , . . .] satisfying (10)\n\nwith \u03c9 ( x ) = \u03b2 \u2212 x will do. The analogous result for \u03bc > 2 and the irrationality exponent\nholds with \u03c9 ( x ) = x \u2212 \u03bc .\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3 and the proof of Theorem 2.\n\n\u2022\n\n5. PRESCRIBING IRRATIONALITY BASES VIA SERIES\nBy a different method, we prove a related existence result for the irrationality\nbase.\nTheorem 4. Any real number \u03b2 > 1 can be realized as the irrationality base of an\nexplicitly constructed series \u03c4 \u03b2 which is not approximable to order \u03b2 \u2212 x ; in fact,\n(11)\n\n\u03c4\u03b2 \u2212\n\n1\np\n> q,\nq\n\u03b2\n\nfor all integers p, q , with q > 0 sufficiently large.\n\nIf \u03b2 = b a > 1 is a rational number in lowest terms, with b > 0, then\n(12)\n\nb\n\n\u03c4 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u22121 + \u03b2 \u2212 b + \u03b2 \u2212 b + \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 .\n\nTo prove Theorem 4, we first prove a lemma in which we construct a series with\nprescribed irrationality base from a sequence of rational numbers with certain properties.\nWe then prove the theorem by constructing the required sequence. The constructions per\nse do not involve continued fractions, but the proof of the lemma does.\n\n\f11\n\nLemma 3.

Moreover, \u03c4 \u03b2 satisfies (11).\nProof. Conditions (13) and (17) imply that the series converges. Since ( a n , b n ) = 1, for\nn \u2265 1, conditions (15) and (17) imply that the nth partial sum of the series has\ndenominator t n , so that for some integer u n ,\nn\n\n(19)\n\nsn := \u2211\n\ni =1\n\nt\nri i \u22121\n\nt\n\nn\n\na i i \u22121\n\ni =1\n\nti\n\n=\u2211\n\n=\n\nun\ntn\n\n,\n\n(u n , t n ) = 1.\n\nFrom (13), (17), and (18), it follows that there is a constant C > 1 such that\n(20)\n\nt\n\nt\n\nrn +n 1 < \u03c4 \u03b2 \u2212 s n < Crn +n 1 ,\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\nUsing (19), (20), and (14), we deduce that if 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b2 \u2212 1 , then\n\n\f12\n\n(21)\n\n0 < \u03c4\u03b2 \u2212\n\nun\ntn\n\n<\n\n1\n\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5 )\n\ntn\n\n<\n\n1\n,\nt n2\n\nn \u2265 n (\u03b5 ) .\n\nIt follows that \u03c4 \u03b2 is irrational, and that \u03b2 (\u03c4 \u03b2 ) \u2265 \u03b2 . To show that \u03b2 (\u03c4 \u03b2 ) \u2264 \u03b2 , we prove the\nstronger condition (11). By Lemma 2, it suffices to show that the convergents pm qm of\n\u03c4 \u03b2 satisfy (11).\nBy (19), (21), and Lemma 2, all but a finite number of partial sums are\nconvergents,\n\nsn =\n\n(22)\n\npm n\nqm n\n\nn \u2265 n0 ,\n\n,\n\nwhere\nqm n = t n .\n\n(23)\n\nUsing (23), (22), (20), and (13), we have\n\npm n\nt\n1\n1\n=\n< \u03c4\u03b2 \u2212\n< C r1 n ,\n2tn qm n +1 2 qm n qm n +1\nqm n\n\nn \u2265 n0 .\n\nSince 0 < r1 < 1, there exists n1 \u2265 n 0 such that if n \u2265 n1 then\n\u2212t n\n\nqmn +1 >\n\nr1\n\n2Ct n\n\n( ).\n2t n\n\n>\n\nlog 2t n\n\nlog \u03b2\n\nNow consider a convergent pm qm of \u03c4 \u03b2 , with m large. If pm qm is a partial sum\n(22), then (13) and the lower bound in (20) imply that pm qm satisfies inequality (11). If\npm qm is not a partial sum, then from (22) we have m n + 1 \u2264 m < m n +1 , for some\nn = n( m) \u2265 n1 . Using (16) and (23), we obtain\n\n(\n\n2t\n\nlog 2bn +n1\nlog \u03b2\n\n)<q\n\nm n +1\n\nHence for m, and thus n, sufficiently large,\n\n\u2264 qm < qm n +1 = t n +1.\n\n\f13\n\n\u03c4\u03b2 \u2212\n\npm n +1 p\npm n +1\nt\npm\n1\n\u2265\n\u2212 m \u2212 \u03c4\u03b2 \u2212\n>\n\u2212 C r1 n+1\nqm\nqm n + 1 qm\nqm n + 1 q m n + 1 qm\n>\n\n1\nt n2+1\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2t n2+1\n\n=\n\n1\n2t\n2bn +n1\n\n>\n\n1\n\n\u03b2\n\nqm\n\n,\n\nso that pm qm satisfies inequality (11). This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\n\u2022\n\nProof of Theorem 4. Given \u03b2 > 1 , construct a sequence of rational numbers rn , as\nfollows.\nCase 1. If \u03b2 is rational, say \u03b2 = b a , with 0 < a < b and ( a, b) = 1, take the constant\nsequence rn = a b , for n \u2265 1.\nCase 2. If \u03b2 is irrational, express 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u22121 in \"base 2\" as\n1\u2212\n\n\u221e\n1\n1\n=\u2211 k ,\n\u03b2 n =1 2 n\n\nwith 0 < k1 < k 2 < k 3 < \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5. Write the nth partial sum of the series as S n = An Bn , where\nk\n\nAn is odd and Bn = 2 n . Choose a positive integer n1 such that B2 \u2264 Tn1 , where Tn\ndenotes the tower of height n defined by\n\nT0 = 1 ,\n\nT\n\nTn = B1 n \u22121 ,\n\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 n1;\n\nfor 1 \u2264 n \u2264 n1, set rn = 1 \u2212 S1 . Now choose n 2 > n1 such that B3 \u2264 Tn 2 , where\nT\n\nTn = B2 n \u22121 ,\n\nn1 + 1 \u2264 n \u2264 n 2 ;\n\nfor n1 + 1 \u2264 n \u2264 n 2 , set rn = 1 \u2212 S 2 . Continuing in this way, we define rn for all n \u2265 1.\nIn both Cases 1 and 2, the sequence r1, r2 , r3 , . . . satisfies conditions (13) to (17)\n(in Case 2, for (17) we have t n = Tn ). The theorem now follows from Lemma 3.\n\u2022\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
