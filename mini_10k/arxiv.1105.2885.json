Introduction\nAt low energies, many strongly-coupled field theories can be described in terms of\nemergent degrees of freedom-often markedly different from those used to define the theory\nat short distances. The most well-known example where this phenomenon occurs is QCD,\nwhich, in the chiral limit, flows from a theory described purely in terms of fermions and\ngauge fields to a free theory of massless pions.\nGiven this picture, an important question that arises is how to express long-distance\ncorrelation functions, written in terms of the fundamental quarks and color gauge fields, as\ncorrelation functions written in terms of mesons. (Of course, in order for this question to\nbe well-defined, one must only consider gauge-invariant correlation functions in the UV.)\nFor instance, one may consider correlation functions of conserved currents, which in\nQCD are associated with the symmetries SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R \u00d7 U (1)B and attempt to\n\nrewrite the corresponding conserved currents in terms of the pions. This procedure is fairly\nstraightforward for the non-Abelian currents, but some interesting complications arise for\nthe baryonic current (for a general treatment see [1]).\nAnother interesting set of quark bilinears in QCD are the \u03c8 \u03c8e operators. In this\n\ncase, one can use an SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R spurion analysis and find that they map to\nU = ei\u03c0\n\na\n\nTa\n\n. Unfortunately, the coefficient in this mapping is incalculable. One can also\n\nconsider the quark bilinear corresponding to the anomalous axial current, U (1)A . However,\nwe are not aware of any systematic procedure of mapping this operator to the IR.1\nIn this paper we will discuss related questions in the context of supersymmetric\n(SUSY) theories. In SUSY theories it is relatively straightforward to follow the flows of\ntwo broad classes of operators-elements of the chiral ring and the (non-chiral) conserved\ncurrent multiplets. The mapping of the conserved currents follows the same rules as in\nnon-SUSY theories. We use either 't-Hooft anomaly matching or Goldstone's theorem to\nrealize various conserved currents in the IR.2 The mapping of the chiral ring is, of course,\npossible due to the strong constraints imposed by holomorphy.\nGeneralizing the above ideas to non-conserved currents (and objects that vanish in\nthe chiral ring) is more difficult. However, understanding their flow is crucial for many\n1\n\nThe situation might be better in the large N limit of QCD; there one can imagine including\n\nthe light \u03b7 \u2032 particle [2].\n2\n\nComplications, as for baryon number in QCD, can arise too, although they do not arise in\n\nthe simplest examples. See [3] for interesting discussions of closely related matters.\n\n1\n\n\fapplications, such as the mapping of soft non-holomorphic mass terms, which, at weak\ncoupling, can be thought of as the lowest components of (non)-conserved current multiplets.\nStudying these questions is the chief goal of this paper.\nThe main utility of supersymmetry in this context is as follows. Consider a current\nbroken explicitly by an anomaly. It satisfies the Adler-Bardeen equation (it is actually not\nimportant for us to work in a scheme where the anomaly is one-loop exact)\n\u2202 \u03bc j\u03bc \u223c F Fe .\n\n(1.1)\n\nHowever, supersymmetry relates F Fe with F 2 since they together form the complex \u03b8 2\n\ncomponent of W\u03b12 . The final crucial ingredient is that F 2 is related to the stress tensor\nvia the usual trace anomaly\nT\u03bc\u03bc \u223c F 2 .\n\n(1.2)\n\nEven if the theory goes through strong coupling, the conserved energy-momentum tensor\nis known at the end points of the flow (as long as there is a description in terms of weaklycoupled degrees of freedom there). From this discussion, we see that we can follow F Fe\n\nand learn something about the flow of anomalous currents.\n\nThe problem can be simplified even further if there is a conserved R-symmetry. Indeed,\nthe corresponding R-current is related to the energy-momentum tensor by SUSY. Being a\nconserved current, the R-current is easily followed along the flow. Therefore, in a heuristic\nsense, supersymmetry extends the simplicity of the flow of the conserved R-current to the\nflow of the anomalous (non-R) current.\nThe question of following non-holomorphic operators, at least in the guise of softSUSY breaking masses, to the IR is not new. Indeed, there is a significant literature on the\nsubject-see e.g. [4-11] and references therein-as well as a framework for understanding\nmany aspects of this problem [12]: our paper is most closely related to this latter work.\nWhile our paper has many new concrete results, its main purpose is to advocate several\nnew points of view on the subject. These perspectives allow us to solve the problem\nwhile completely avoiding discussions of subtleties associated with RG invariant versus\nRG non-invariant (i.e. scheme-independent versus scheme-dependent) quantities. Most\nimportantly, our tools provide us with general results that are valid uniformly in all theories\nconsidered, including ones that have not been addressed before.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we describe in detail the procedure outlined above. In sections 3, 4, and 5 we discuss three examples in which one can\n2\n\n\fmap some non-chiral operators to a weakly-coupled dual description. These examples\ndemonstrate slightly different aspects and nuances of the general procedure. In section 6\nwe consider theories that flow to an interacting superconformal field theory (SCFT) at\nlong distances. In section 7 we discuss the remaining open questions, most importantly,\nemphasizing possible applications to EWSB, and conclude.\n\n2. The Axial Anomaly and the Energy-Momentum Tensor\nIn this section we review the well-known connection between the axial anomaly, the\nenergy-momentum tensor, and the R-symmetry current (if the latter exists). To that\nend, we first note that the the anti-commutation relations, {Q, Q} \u223c P , imply that the\n\nsupercurrent and the energy-momentum tensor sit in the same multiplet. The question\nthen becomes how to write an irreducible representation of SUSY containing the supercurrent and the energy-momentum tensor. The simplest solution is the Ferrara-Zumino\nmultiplet [13]3\n\u03b1\u0307\n\nD J\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = D\u03b1 X ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere X is chiral and J\u03bc is real. In some cases, which are not relevant to this paper, the\nFZ multiplet does not exist [14,15].\n\nWriting out the solution to (2.1), we find that the \u03b8 2 component of X contains the\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor as well as the divergence of the bottom component\nof J\u03bc . In pure super Yang-Mills theory, X is proportional to W\u03b12 . The trace of the\n\nenergy-momentum tensor is proportional to F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd , while the ABJ equation relates the\ndivergence of the bottom component of J\u03bc to F Fe.4\nIntuitively, it is this connection between the anomaly and the energy-momentum ten-\n\nsor that allows one to say more than usual about the flow of the anomalous current. It\nis relatively easy to identify the energy-momentum tensor in the IR of a complicated flow\n(as long as we know what the, possibly emergent, degrees of freedom are there). This\ndiscussion also suggests that coupling the rigid theory to supergravity, as in [12], might\n3\n\n\u03bc\n1 \u03b1\u0307\u03b1\nWe adopt the following conventions: l\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u22122\u03c3\u03b1\n\u03b1\u0307 l\u03bc , l\u03bc = 4 \u03c3 \u03bc l\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 .\n\n4\n\nIncidentally, this relation leads to the famous \"anomaly puzzle,\" (see [16-19], and many\n\nreferences therein, for a more detailed discussion of this puzzle) since one would expect the anomaly\nto be naturally one-loop exact while the beta function has contributions from all loop orders. This\napparent paradox will not affect our discussion below in any way.\n\n3\n\n\fshed some light on the mapping of anomalous currents. We will not consider supergravity\nin this note.\nWhen the theory under consideration has an exact R-symmetry, there is a more natural representation of the supercurrent which, as we will see below, leads to a simpler\ndescription of the physics. In such a case, the conserved R-current transforms as the\nbottom component of a supercurrent multiplet that is defined by\n\u03b1\u0307\n\nD R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03c7\u03b1 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere \u03c7\u03b1 is chiral and satisfies the usual Bianchi identitiy D\u03c7 = D\u03c7, and R\u03bc is real. In\n\nthe systems of interest to us, both the FZ multiplet (2.1) and the R-multiplet (2.2) exist.\n\nFrom this statement, it follows that the Bianchi identity for \u03c7\u03b1 can be solved in terms of\na well-defined real superfield, U , and so\n\u03b1\u0307\n\n2\n\nD R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = D D\u03b1 U .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe general picture of what happens to U along a flow is simple to understand. In the\nasymptotically free theories we will study below, R and U start out in the UV as bilinears\nin the various weakly-coupled superfields (with appropriate contributions of \u223c\n\n1\ng 2 W\u03b1 W \u03b1\u0307\n\nto R and appropriate factors of eV to render R and U gauge invariant; we neglect these\nterms for simplicity-a more detailed recent discussion of many of the issues discussed\n\nhere can be found in [20,21,15,22,23,24,25,26]). Indeed, solving (2.3), one finds that for\nthe matter superfields, \u03a6i , with R-charges, ri , the expressions for R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 and U take the\n\nform\n\nR\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 =\n\nX\u0010\ni\n\ni\n\n2D\u03b1 \u03a6i D\u03b1\u0307 \u03a6 \u2212 ri [D\u03b1 , D\u03b1\u0307 ]\u03a6i \u03a6\n\nU=\n\nX\u0012\ni\n\n3ri\n1\u2212\n2\n\n\u0013\n\ni\n\n\u03a6 \u03a6i .\n\ni\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nNote that the contributions to U of fields with ri = 2/3 vanish because this is the superconformal R-charge for fields at the Gaussian UV fixed point.\nWe should elaborate on what it means to solve for U . Equation (2.3) does not fix\n2\n\nU uniquely, but only fixes D D\u03b1 U . This leads to the usual supergauge ambiguity, U \u2192\n\nU + \u03a9 + \u03a9, where \u03a9 is chiral. In writing (2.5) we have discarded all such holomorphic\nterms. Indeed, in most cases they can be completely ignored by symmetry arguments.\nHowever, we will see cases where even if such terms are not included in the UV, adding\nsuch terms in the IR is forced on us by consistency.\n4\n\n\fIt is also due to such ambiguities in solving superspace equations that we opt to use\nthe R-multiplet rather than the FZ-multiplet. Indeed, in the latter case one can show\n\nthat ambiguities arise not only from purely holomorphic terms, but also from conserved\ncurrents (which generically exist and render the analysis harder).\nNow, as we flow to the IR, we can use the R-multiplet to follow U . The IR is described\n\nby some SCFT, and U can be described as U \u223c \u039b2\u2212d O, for some real operator, O, of\ndimension d \u2265 2, and some scale, \u039b. We can assume the dimension of the real operator O\n\nis \u2265 2 by unitarity and by the fact that we can remove holomorphic plus anti-holomorphic\n\ncontributions.\n\nIn the case that d > 2, U formally vanishes at the IR fixed point (i.e. deep in the IR).\nThis means that the bottom component of R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 becomes the superconformal R-symmetry.5\n\nIn other words, the R-symmetry we have chosen in the UV becomes the superconformal\none in the infrared. But we know this is not always the case. There could be multiple\nchoices for the R-symmetry in the UV and there can also be accidental symmetries in the\nIR. When the R-current we follow doesn't flow to the IR superconformal one, then U is\nnonzero in the IR and it flows to a certain current of dimension 2\nU\u2192\n\n3\nJ .\n2\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis conserved current, J, may be a conserved current of the full theory, or it may correspond to an accidental symmetry of the IR fixed point.6\nFormally, J has a simple description. It is just the conserved current which parameterizes the difference between the superconformal R-symmetry and the one in the multiplet\nwe are following along the flow. This can be shown by recalling that the IR superconT\nformal theory admits the superconformal multiplet RCF\n(i.e., the multiplet for which\n\u03bc\n5\n\nA special case which is slightly more subtle is when the IR SCFT is approached by a\n\nmarginally irrelevant operator. This can be represented by U = \u03b3J , where J is some dimension 2 operator in the IR SCFT and \u03b3 is an anomalous dimension that goes to zero in the deep\nIR, as required. The general construction of this J and the calculation of \u03b3 is presented in the\nframework of [27]. We thank D. Green and N. Seiberg for helpful conversations on the matter.\n6\n\nThe above discussion relies on the assumption that the fixed points are conformal in addition\n\nto being scale-invariant. Whether this is always true is an open question (see [28,29] for some\naspects of the problem). However, in many cases of interest, like SQCD and various simple\ngeneralizations, conformality is strongly suggested by the discussion in [30] and various related\nworks. This picture has been given further reenforcement recently in [31].\n\n5\n\n\f\u03b1\u0307\n\nT\nD RCF\n= 0 at the IR fixed point). We can write this multiplet in terms of the IR limit\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\n\nof (2.3) and the (perhaps accidentally) conserved current multiplet, J, as follows\n3\nU CF T = U IR \u2212 J = 0 .\n2\n\nT\nRCF\n= RIR\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u2212 [D\u03b1 , D \u03b1\u0307 ]J ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere U IR is the deep IR limit of U , and J is the multiplet for the symmetry that mixes\nwith the R-charge corresponding to R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 to create the superconformal R-symmetry.

In many examples this is fixed by duality. Additionally, we have the powerful tools of [33].\nIn many theories, there are free-magnetic phases, where the IR is a Gaussian fixed\npoint. Then the abstract discussion above takes a very simple form, since the superconformal R-charge is 2/3 for all the chiral fields. U IR is then fixed by the IR analog of (2.5),\nnamely\nU\n\nIR\n\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n3ri\ni\n\u03c6 \u03c6i ,\n1\u2212\n=\n2\ni\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the \u03c6i are the \"emergent\" chiral superfields at low energies and ri are their Rcharges. The simplest example of such a theory is SQCD in the free magnetic phase,\nwhich we will now discuss in much greater detail.\n\n3. The Anomalous Current of SQCD\nIn this section we will consider SU (Nc ) N = 1 SQCD with Nf in the free magnetic\n\nrange, i.e. Nc + 1 < Nf \u2264 3Nc /2.

The low energy\n\ndegrees of freedom consist of a dual IR-free SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) gauge group, Nf dual quark\nsuperfields q, qe in the fundamental anti-fundamental representations of SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ), and\n\na gauge singlet meson Nf \u00d7 Nf matrix, M . We summarize this matter content in the\nfollowing table\n\nSU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) SU (Nf ) \u00d7 SU (Nf )\nq\nqe\n\nM\n\nU (1)R\n\nU (1)B\nNc\nNf \u2212Nc\nc\n\u2212 NfN\u2212N\nc\n\nNf \u2212 Nc\n\nNf \u00d7 1\n\nNc\nNf\nNc\nNf\n\n1\n\nNf \u00d7 Nf\n\nNc\n2 \u2212 2N\nf\n\nNf \u2212 Nc\n\n1 \u00d7 Nf\n\n(3.3)\n\n0\n\nSince the theory is IR-free, the natural normalization of these dual fields is to choose their\nkinetic terms to be canonical.\nGiven this picture, we would like to know how the operators in (3.2) are realized in\nthe dual theory of (3.3). It is difficult to answer this question exactly, since the result\ndepends on incalculable corrections to the K\u00e4hler potential of the IR degrees of freedom.\nHowever, here we are only interested in knowing what the operators in (3.2) flow to in the\ndeep IR, where all such corrections are irrelevant.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, it is extremely easy to follow to the IR operators\nof the form (3.2) that correspond to conserved currents. For example, consider Qi Q\u2020i \u2212\nei Q\ne \u2020 . This operator can be identified with the bottom component of the conserved baryon\nQ\ni\n\nsuperfield\n\nD\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne\u2020 = 0 .\nei Q\nQi Q\u2020i \u2212 Q\ni\n\n(3.4)\n\nWe can immediately conclude that in the deep IR it should be matched to the baryon\nnumber current of the magnetic theory. In other words,\neQ\ne \u2212\u2192\nQQ\u2020 \u2212 Q\n\n\u0001\nNc\n|q|2 \u2212 |e\nq |2 .\nNf \u2212 Nc\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe numerical factor on the RHS of this equation follows from the well-known baryon\ncharge of the magnetic quarks (see table (3.3)).\nIt is just as easy to follow some other special bilinears in the squark superfields.\ne aQ\ne \u2020 (with traceless,\nIndeed, all the bilinears given by linear combinations of QT a Q\u2020 and QT\n\nHermitian, T a ) can be thought of as the bottom components of the non-Abelian currents\n7\n\n\fassociated with SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R and can thus be directly mapped to the IR (this is\n\ndone via the action of these symmetries on the magnetic degrees of freedom (3.3)).\n\nIn the space of all bilinears (3.2) there is, however, one linearly independent combination which is non-trivial to map to the IR. Without loss of generality, this linear\ncombination can be chosen to be\neQ\ne\u2020 .\nJA = QQ\u2020 + Q\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis is not the bottom component of any conserved current. In fact, it is the bottom\ncomponent of the anomalous axial current\n2\n\nD JA \u223c W\u03b12 .\n\n(3.7)\n\nAs we have explained in the previous sections, following anomalous currents is nontrivial. We will now see that supersymmetry helps us bypass this problem in a simple\nmanner.\nWe note that the theory (3.1) has a non-anomalous R-symmetry and so we can associate an R-multiplet to this R-symmetry along the flow. Using the formula (2.5) and\ntable (3.1), we can identify U in the far UV in terms of the electric quarks as\nU\n\nUV\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\n3Nc \u0010\n1\neQ\ne\u2020 ,\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n= \u2212 +\n2 2Nf\n\n(3.8)\n\nand in the IR we can express U in terms of the magnetic degrees of freedom using (2.8)\nand the R-charges in table (3.3)\nU\n\nIR\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n3Nc\n3Nc\n\u2020\n\u2020\nqq + qeqe \u2212 2 \u2212\nM M \u2020.\n= 1\u2212\n2Nf\nNf\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis shows that the operator (3.6) undergoes the following flow\n\n\u0001\neQ\ne \u2020 \u2212\u2192 2Nf \u2212 3Nc qq \u2020 + qeqe\u2020 \u2212 2M M \u2020 .\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n3Nc \u2212 Nf\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis is an exact result. In this formula (3.10) we have chosen the mesons and magnetic\nquarks to be canonically normalized.8\n8\n\nNote that if one interprets (3.10) as the action of the anomalous axial current on the IR\n\ndegrees of freedom, we find that the cubic superpotenial of the magnetic theory, Wmag = qM qe, is\ninvariant.\n\n8\n\n\f2\n\nOne interesting consequence of the above discussion is that, upon acting with D on\nboth sides of the mapping in (3.10), we find the physical relation between the electric and\nmagnetic field strengths\n2\nW\u03b1,el\n\u2212\u2192\n\nThis is again an exact result.9\n\n2Nf \u2212 3Nc 2\nW\n.\n3Nc \u2212 Nf \u03b1,mag\n\n(3.11)\n\n3.1. Soft SUSY-Breaking\nWe can immediately apply the results in (3.10) and (3.11) to study the mapping of\nsoft terms in the electric theory to soft terms in the magnetic theory. To that end, consider\ndeforming the UV Lagrangian by adding the bottom components of the current in (3.6)\nand the electric field-strength bilinear in (3.11) so that we give small squark and gaugino\nsoft masses to the electric fields\n2\n\n\u03b4Lel = \u2212m JA | \u2212\n\n2\nm\u03bb (W\u03b1,el\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n\u2020\ne\ne\n+ hc)| = \u2212m QQ + QQ + m\u03bb (\u03bb2el + c.c.) ,\n2\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere we take m2 and m\u03bb positive with m, m\u03bb \u226a \u039bel,mag , and \u039bel,mag are the dynamical\nscales of the electric and magnetic theories respectively.\n\nSince the soft deformations in (3.12) are small (compared to \u039bel,mag ), we can treat the\nunderlying dynamics of the theory as supersymmetric and work in the \"probe approximation,\" where the subleading O(m/\u039b) and O(m\u03bb /\u039b) corrections to the IR soft masses are\n\nneglected.10 For simplicity, we also neglect possible contributions to scalar masses squared\n9\n\n2\n2\n\u2192 \u2212W\u03b1,mag\nmade in [34] and\nThe reader may wonder how this relates to the claim W\u03b1,el\n\nelsewhere. The main point is that this mapping is derived by using the holomorphic scale matching\n2\n2\n\u2192 \u2212W\u03b1,mag\nis only valid modulo trivial elements of the chiral\nrelation, which means that W\u03b1,el\n\nring.

Note that the exact result also has a\nsign flip in the free magnetic phase, so the interpretation of one coupling growing while the other\ndecreasing, remains.\n10\n\nIn QCD this is what one does to follow quark masses in the chiral Lagrangian. In the chiral\n\nLagrangian, however, there is an incalculable overall coefficient in the mapping. This incalculable\ncoefficient can be expressed in terms of the mass of the physical pion, and the probe approximation\namounts to expanding in\n\nm\u03c0\nf\u03c0\n\n. In our case, since we solved for the mapping exactly, no incalculable\n\ncoefficients arise.\n\n9\n\n\fscaling like m2\u03bb . These may be important for phenomenological applications, but we will\nnot discuss them here.\nIn this approximation, we see from (3.10) and (3.11) that the magnetic deformation\ncorresponding to (3.12) is\n\u03b4Lmag = \u2212m2 *\n\n\u0001\n2Nf \u2212 3Nc 2\n2Nf \u2212 3Nc\nqq \u2020 + qeqe\u2020 \u2212 2M M \u2020 + m\u03bb *\n(\u03bb\n+ c.c.) , (3.13)\n3Nc \u2212 Nf\n3Nc \u2212 Nf mag\n\nThese results agree with [7,8,12]. Our derivation shows that the ability to map soft\n\nterms follows from the simple mapping of the electric and magnetic R-symmetry (the role\nof the R-symmetry was also emphasized, although from a slightly different perspective, in\n[12]).\nNote that if all the masses in the UV are positive, then, in the IR, the magnetic\nsquarks are tachyonic (we are in the free magnetic phase and so 2Nf \u2212 3Nc < 0). It\n\nturns out that even the magnetic D-terms and superpotential do not help to stabilize the\nmagnetic squarks; for example, there is an instability along the direction q \u223c 1I, qe = 0,\nM = 0.11 Our approximation does not allow one to know where the theory settles.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that we can stabilize the dynamics by considering\na simple deformation of SQCD. To see this, consider weakly gauging baryon number with\nsome small gauge coupling, gB . Then, it is easy to prove that there are no instabilities\nwhich take us out of the calculable regime (as long as gB is not too small). Indeed, one\nfinds a vacuum with q \u223c\n\nm\n1I,\ngB\n\nqe = 0, M = 0 and of course a similar vacuum with q\n\ninterchanged with qe. Therefore, all we need for calculability is that gB is much larger\n\nthan m/\u039b but sufficiently smaller than all the other couplings in the theory. This vacuum\n\nbreaks the magnetic gauge symmetry and Higgses baryon number too. The remaining\nnon-Abelian flavor symmetry is SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) \u00d7 SU (Nc ) \u00d7 SU (Nf ). (Note the color-flavor\nlocking phenomenon. Ideas along these lines thus present an opportunity for extending\n\nvarious recent studies such as [35-38] into the non-supersymmetric domain.) If, on the\nother hand, the gauge coupling gB is sufficiently large compared to the gauge and Yukawa\ncouplings of the theory, a different stable vacuum appears, where q \u223c qe \u223c m and M = 0.\n\nBoth of these vacua will be mentioned again briefly in the last section, motivated by some\npossible phenomenological applications.\n11\n\nBy the equation q \u223c 1I, we mean that we choose the upper left (Nf \u2212 Nc ) \u00d7 (Nf \u2212 Nc ) block\n\nto be proportional to the unit matrix, and the rest of the entries to be zero. The same comment\napplies everywhere below.\n\n10\n\n\fFinally, from our discussion above it is clear that we can consider the most general set\nof non-holomorphic soft terms in the UV by adding (3.2) and decomposing it into the soft\nterms associated to the conserved currents and the anomalous current we have discussed\nat length.\n\n4. The Deformed Moduli Space\nWhen some of the symmetries of the short-distance theory are broken spontaneously,\nthere are interesting subtleties in the flow of the U operator (2.5). In particular, the\nholomorphic plus anti-holomorphic pieces of the type discussed in section 2 appear.\nThe deformed moduli space of Nf = Nc SQCD [39] is a simple arena in which to\nstudy these ideas. Indeed, the quantum dynamics of SQCD with Nf = Nc > 2 deforms\nthe moduli space so that it is parameterized by baryons and mesons subject to\ne = \u039b2Nc .\ndetM \u2212 B B\n\n(4.1)\n\nHence, some of the UV symmetries are necessarily spontaneously broken.\nWe will see below that U receives contributions from the corresponding Goldstone\nmultiplets and that requiring invariance of U under the resulting nonlinearly-realized symmetries both necessitates the inclusion of holomorphic plus anti-holomorphic corrections\nto U that are quadratic in the Goldstone multiplets and, simultaneously, fixes their mixing with U exactly. We will also see a vacuum in which this ambiguity is not fixed by\nsymmetries.\nEven though the global symmetries are spontaneously broken, it is still straightforward\nto follow conserved currents to the IR.12\nThe anomalous current, is, of course, harder to follow. To proceed, we consider the\nfollowing highly symmetric vacuum satisfying (4.1)\nM =0,\n\ne = \u039bNc .\nB=B\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis vacuum breaks the symmetry according to SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R \u00d7 U (1)B \u00d7 U (1)R \u0592\u2192\nSU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R \u00d7 U (1)R . The massless fluctuations in this vacuum are the meson\nmatrix \u03b4M and the Goldstone superfield, \u03b4b, associated with U (1)B breaking.\n12\n\nThere could, however, be some complications. In addition to the one already mentioned,\n\nanalogous to the complication in following the baryon current in QCD, there are also exotic cases\nwhen the ordinary linear multiplets are not globally well defined, see [24] and references therein.\n\n11\n\n\feQ\ne\u2020.\nWe are interested in finding the low energy limit of the axial current, JA = QQ\u2020 + Q\n\nNoting that all the chiral fields have vanishing R-charge, we use (2.8), and immediately\nfind that, up to holomorphic plus anti-holomorphic pieces, U = \u03b4M \u03b4M \u2020 + \u03b4b\u03b4b\u2020 . Note,\nhowever, that this operator is not invariant under the non-linear imaginary shift symmetry\nof \u03b4b. Therefore, we must replace \u03b4b\u03b4b\u2020 \u2192 12 (\u03b4b + \u03b4b\u2020 )2 and we conclude that\n\u0001\neQ\ne \u2020 \u2212\u2192 Tr \u03b4M \u03b4M \u2020 + 1 (\u03b4b + \u03b4b\u2020 )2 .\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\nWe see that the addition of a purely holomorphic and anti-holomorphic piece quadratic\nin the Goldstone multiplet is forced on us. The answer (4.3) is exact in the deep IR, in\nparticular, there are no further holomorphic ambiguities.13\nUnlike the discussion\nof the\n\u0010\n\u0011 previous section, just adding a soft deformation in the\n2\n\u2020\n\u2020\neQ\ne , is enough to end up with a stable vacuum in the IR.\nUV, \u03b4L = \u2212m QQ + Q\n\nEquation (4.3) shows that all the meson fluctuations are massive, the real part of the\nbaryon is massive as well, and the imaginary part is the ordinary Goldstone boson for\nU (1)B breaking in this non-SUSY vacuum.\nOne can also consider adding a soft gaugino mass in the UV. Even though there are\nno gauge fields in the IR, this affects the infrared in a nontrivial way at leading order in\n2\n\nthe gaugino mass. We can hit (4.3) from both sides with D . On the left hand side we get\nthe usual fields strength squared operator from the ABJ equation, while on the right hand\nside most terms vanish by the free equations of motion (neglecting irrelevant corrections\nfrom the K\u00e4hler potential). However, when we hit (\u03b4b\u2020 )2 , we get \u223c \u03c8 b \u03c8 b . In other words,\nup to an order one coefficient,\n\n1\nW\u03b12\n8\u03c0 2\n\n\u03b1\u0307\n\n\u2212\u2192 D\u03b1\u0307 b\u2020 D b\u2020 . As a result, a gaugino mass in the\n\nUV manifests itself in the IR via a mass term for the fermionic partner of the Goldstone\nboson.14\nThe deformed moduli space has another vacuum with an enhanced symmetry\ne=0.\nB=B\n\nM = \u039b1I ,\n13\n\n(4.4)\n\ne with an\nThe Z2 interchange symmetry acting on the UV degrees of freedom as Q \u2194 Q,\n\nappropriate action on the vector superfield, rules out the appearance of the linear term \u03b4b + \u03b4b\u2020 .\n\nThe remaining linearly realized symmetries also force holomorphic contributions in \u03b4M to vanish.\n14\n\nNote that this fermionic mass term is enhanced by a loop factor compared to the gaugino\n\nmass. This could have some interesting phenomenological applications, because it is usually hard\nto generate large fermionic masses compared to scalars in the same multiplet. One possible\nconnection to phenomenology could thus be through the problems revolving around the \u03bc-term.\n\n12\n\n\fThe symmetry breaking here is SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R \u00d7 U (1)B \u00d7 U (1)R \u0592\u2192 SU (Nf )V \u00d7\n\nU (1)B \u00d7 U (1)R . In this vacuum, the massless fluctuations are the traceless mesons \u03b4M in\ne in the 0(\u00b1N ,0) representation.\nthe Adj(0,0) representation, and the baryons, \u03b4B and \u03b4 B,\nc\n\nRepeating the mapping of the axial current, we again find that some holomorphic\n\nterms in the mesons are necessarily induced with known coefficients. However, we now\ne whose mixing with U we\nhave an ambiguous chiral singlet operator of the form \u03b4B\u03b4 B,\n\ncannot fix. We therefore add it with an unknown coefficient, c\neQ\ne \u2020 \u2212\u2192\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00012\n1\ne B\ne \u2020 + c \u03b4B\u03b4 B\ne + c.c. .\nT r \u03b4M + \u03b4M \u2020 + \u03b4B\u03b4B \u2020 + \u03b4 B\u03b4\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nThis ambiguity prevents us from making exact statements about the nature of this vacuum\nwhen we softly deform the theory in the UV.\nThe case of Nf = Nc = 2 might be interesting for model building, so we comment\non it too. In the most symmetric vacuum, one finds the symmetry breaking pattern\nSO(6) \u0592\u2192 SO(5). The fluctuations are in two five-dimensional representation of SO(5).\nThis symmetry precludes any linear terms in the fluctuations from appearing in the map\nand so the symmetric point remains an extremum upon softly deforming the theory in the\nUV by the bottom component of the axial current. With identical tools to those we have\nused above, one also finds that all the partners of the Golstone bosons are stabilized and\nhence the most symmetric point is a local minimum. There is no ambiguity in quadratic\nholomorphic terms, and all the masses are calculable, as in all the examples we have studied\nbesides (4.4).\n\n5. Kutasov Duality\nIn the above sections we considered theories with only one non-conserved current in\nthe UV-the current corresponding to the anomalous symmetry. In this section, we will\nanalyze theories with more non-conserved currents in the UV. A simple example is given\nby adjoint SQCD with a superpotential for the adjoint, X. In such a case there are two\nindependent non-conserved currents in the UV-the one corresponding to U , which sits\nin the same multiplet as the (unique) non-anomalous R-symmetry, and a non-anomalous\ncurrent which is explicitly broken by the superpotential.\n13\n\n\fThe theories we will discuss in this section were studied in [40,41,42] and have the\nfollowing particle content and symmetries\n\nQ\ne\nQ\n\nX\n\nSU (Nc )\n\nSU (Nf ) \u00d7 SU (Nf )\n\nNc\n\nNf \u00d7 1\n\nNc\nN2c \u2212 1\n\n1 \u00d7 Nf\n1\u00d71\n\nU (1)R\n2\nk+1\n2\n\u2212 k+1\n2\nk+1\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n\nNc\nNf\nNc\nNf\n\nU (1)B\n1\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u22121\n0\n\nThe superpotential for the adjoint has the form W = s0 Tr(X k+1 ) and breaks the symmetry\nassociated with the non-anomalous current\n\u0011\nNc \u0010\neQ\ne \u2020 \u2212 XX \u2020 ,\nJX =\nQQ\u2020 + Q\nNf\n\n(5.2)\n\n2\n\nwhere D JX \u223c s0 Tr(X k+1 ).

Being able to follow such an operator would amount, via D JX \u223c s0 Tr(X k+1 ), to\n\nfollowing s0 Tr(X k+1 ), but since the latter vanishes in the chiral ring this is not straightforward (any formula obtained from chiral ring relations cannot be trusted since it contains\nthe same information as 0 = 0).15\n\n6. Conformal Theories\nIn section 2 we described the flow of U when the IR is given by some general SCFT,\nbut so far we have focused mostly on theories with a free IR description. In this section\nwe will briefly consider theories with an interacting IR fixed point.\nLet us start from SQCD in the conformal window 3Nc /2 \u2264 Nf < 3Nc . Now, the non-\n\nanomalous R-symmetry of the ultraviolet (3.1) becomes the superconformal one in the IR,\neQ\ne \u2020 flows to zero. But we would like to say a little more. At\nand so in the deep IR QQ\u2020 + Q\n\nthe onset of the conformal window Nf = 3Nc /2, the free fixed point in the IR is approached\neQ\ne \u2020 flows\nlogarithmically, due to a marginally irrelevant operator. This means that QQ\u2020 + Q\n\nto zero in the deep IR logarithmically too. (Indeed, the right hand side of (3.10) vanishes\nupon substituting Nf = 3Nc /2.) However, in the bulk of the conformal window, the fixed\neQ\ne \u2020 flows to some\npoints are approached by strictly irrelevant operators,16 and so QQ\u2020 + Q\noperator of dimension > 2 in the IR SCFT, divided by an appropriate power of the strong\nscale, \u039b.\nLet us see what this implies for soft deformations of the theory. Suppose we softly\n\u0011\n\u0010\neQ\ne \u2020 . Then, in the bulk of\ndeform the theory in the ultraviolet by \u03b4L = \u2212m2 QQ\u2020 + Q\n\nthe conformal window, all the effects of this deformation in the infrared (say at energy\n\nscales of order m) are suppressed by powers of \u039b, which can be thought of as an ultraviolet\ncutoff at low energies. Therefore, unlike the examples we have studied in the free magnetic\n15\n\nBy matching chiral primaries, we can, however, show that the charge of Y under JX is the\n\nsame as that of X.\n16\n\nOne can argue that this is true as follows. The conventional wisdom about the conformal\n\nwindow of SQCD is that in the bulk of it there are no accidental symmetries in the infrared.\nHowever, marginally irrelevant operators must violate some of the symmetries of the SCFT [43,27].\nBut since the RG flow preserves all the symmetries, we conclude that the conformal point is not\napproached via marginally irrelevant operators.\n\n15\n\n\fphase, here the effects of a deformation at the scale m in the UV may become important\nonly at much lower energy scales. For instance, this scale would be m2 /\u039b if the first term\nappearing in U is a real operator in the SCFT of dimension 3 divided by \u039b. This scenario\ncan be thought of as a very close relative of the phenomenon that non-BPS operators\nobtain positive anomalous dimensions in SCFTs, which then lead to suppressed effects of\nnon-SUSY deformations.17\nA more interesting example to consider is adjoint SQCD without a superpotential.\nSome of the fields in the IR decouple, and allow us to write an explicit expression for their\ncontribution to U IR . The matter content and representations of this theory are\nSU (Nc ) SU (Nf ) \u00d7 SU (Nf ) U (1)R U (1)\u2032 U (1)B\nQ\ne\nQ\n\nNc\n\nNf \u00d7 1\n\n1\u2212\n\n2Nc\n3Nf\n2Nc\n3Nf\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(6.1)\n\nNc\n1 \u00d7 Nf\n1\u2212\n1\n\u22121\nX\n\u22121\n1\u00d71\n2/3\n\u22121\n0\nAssociated\n\u0010 with the\n\u0011 \u0010R-symmetry \u0011in (6.1) one finds the axial anomaly operator in the UV,\nN\n1\neQ\ne \u2020 . We would like to find the IR end point of the flow for\nU UV = \u2212 + c\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n2\n\nN2c\n\nNf\n\nthis operator.\n\nThe procedure summarized in (2.6) and (2.7) instructs us to identify the superconformal\nR-symmetry\nin the\n\u0011 IR, and, once this is done, the end point of the flow\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\nNc\n1\neQ\ne \u2020 is determined: up to an overall factor of 3/2, it is simQQ\u2020 + Q\nof \u2212 2 + Nf\nply the global symmetry current operator that makes up for the difference between the\nR-symmetry in (6.1) and the superconformal one (which can be determined from amaximization in this case).\nAs has been discussed in great detail in [45,46], for small enough values of Nf /Nc\nthere are also free fields in the low energy SCFT. For instance (at large Nc ), if Nf /Nc <\n\u221a\ne becomes free. Upon lowering Nf /Nc further, more and more\n(3 + 7)\u22121 , then M0 = QQ\ne become free. Their superconformal R-charge is therefore\nmesons of the form Mi = QX i Q\n\ncorrected to be 2/3 and we can immediately\n\u0010 use (2.6)\n\u0011 \u0010 to determine\u0011 how they appear in\nNc\n1\neQ\ne\u2020\nthe low energy expression of the operator \u2212 2 + Nf\nQQ\u2020 + Q\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nP (Nf /Nc ) \u0012\n\u0011\nX\n3R(Mj )\n1\nNc \u0010\n\u2020\n\u2020\ne\ne\n1\u2212\n\u2212 +\nQQ + QQ \u2212\u2192\nMj Mj\u2020 + * * *\n2 Nf\n2\nj=0\n=\u2212\n\nP (Nf /Nc ) \u0012\n\nX\ni=0\n\n17\n\nj+2\u22122\n\nNc\nNf\n\n\u0013\n\n(6.2)\n\nMj Mj\u2020 + * * * .\n\nSuch a setup may even lead to accidental SUSY and may be of phenomenological interest.\nSee the nice recent discussion in [44] and references therein.\n\n16\n\n\fHere the * * * stand for an operator (which is also a global current according to (2.6)) in the\ninteracting SCFT module. We have only displayed the contributions from the free fields,\nbecause these are the ones that can be represented explicitly in terms of some well-defined\ndegrees of freedom. Also, P (Nf /Nc ) is defined to be the number of free fields for the given\nvalue of Nf /Nc . This function can be deduced from a-maximization.\nNote that (6.2) implies that if we softly deform the UV theory by adding a\neQ\ne \u2020 ), the\nmass squared for the electric scalars of the form, \u03b4L = \u2212m2 (QQ\u2020 + Q\nUV\n\nfree fields in the infrared acquire a leading-order mass squared of the form m2j =\n\u0010\n\u0011\nNf\n2\nFor instance, when M0 becomes free, Nf /Nc \u2264\nNc \u2212Nf /2 (2Nc /Nf \u2212 2 \u2212 j) mUV .\n\u221a \u22121\n(3 + 7) , such a soft deformation in the UV would stabilize it at the origin.\n\n7. Discussion and Open Questions\nIn this note, we have described a simple way to follow anomalous currents along the\nRG flow. In the context of Seiberg duality, this extends the map of operators to anomalous\n(non-chiral) current multiplets. We have also seen that there are some simple results for\ntheories whose low energy description is given in terms of an interacting SCFT. Beyond\nthe general interest in understanding the maps of different operators under complicated\nRG flows, our study could be of phenomenological relevance in supersymmetric models of\ncompositeness, and most obviously in models of composite electroweak symmetry breaking.\nSU (Nc ) SU (2)L\nH\ne\nH\n\n\u03a6i=1...Nc \u22121\ne i=1...N \u22121\n\u03a6\nc\n\nNc\nNc\nNc\nNc\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\nU (1)Y\n1\n2\n\u2212 12\n1\n2\n\u2212 12\n\n(7.1)\n\nIt is worth presenting a simple example that illustrates how these results might be\napplied. Consider the model for a composite Higgs sector shown in Table (7.1), which\nconsists of an SQCD theory with Nf = Nc + 1 and Nc \u2265 3, and U (1)B being identified\nwith hypercharge.\n\nThe confined phase of this theory has Nf = Nc + 1 baryon/antibaryon pairs,\ne \u2261 (h, e\nB, B\nh, \u03c6i=1...Nc \u22121 , \u03c6ei=1...Nc \u22121 ) and also mesons M of zero hypercharge, which can\n17\n\n\fbe identified as follows\n\n\uf8f1\nhi=1...Nc \u22121 =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2e\nhi=1...Nc \u22121 =\nM\u2261\n\uf8f4\nT +\u03b7 =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b7ij =\n\nOne also adds the usual tree-level superpotential\n\ne i)\n(H \u03a6\ne i)\n(H\u03a6\ne\n(H H)\ne\n(\u03a6\u03a6)\n\ne B \u2212 \u039b3\u2212Nf detM ,\nW (conf ) = BM\n\n(7.2)\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere we suppress flavor indices.\n\nThe nice feature of this model is that the hypercharge is identified with U (1)B which is\ntherefore gauged. As we mentioned in Section 3, when gY is of order unity and sufficiently\nlarge with respect to the Yukawa coupling, one obtains a minimum in which the baryons\nand antibaryons get VEVs of order m, but the mesons' VEVs are zero. This can naturally\nbreak SU (2)L \u00d7U (1)Y \u0592\u2192 U (1)QED . Note that the SU (2)L triplet does not obtain a VEV.\nThis is phenomenologically desirable.\n\nAn obvious technical issue that needs to be taken care of is vacuum alignment, namely,\nforcing the theory to break the global symmetries in the required fashion, and avoiding\nother points on the Goldstone manifold. For this it is promising to consider explicit\nbreaking of flavor in the SUSY breaking operators. Then only the baryon/antibaryon pair\nwith the most negative mass-squared in the IR gets a VEV, while the remaining modes are\nall massive. In particular all the erstwhile Goldstone modes associated with the broken\nglobal flavor symmetries are stabilized (except for the R-axion, which can be lifted by\nother means).\nThis kind of set-up seems very advantageous. The scale of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is naturally of order the SUSY breaking parameters. The stable EWSB minimum\nappears automatically, perhaps without some of the complications conventional MSSM\nelectroweak symmetry breaking entails.\nNote that there are many alternative possibilities: for example by taking the minima\ne = M = 0 that appear when gB is smaller than the Yukawa coupling\nwith B 6= 0 and B\n\n(up to some numerical constant), and embedding both h and e\nh in the baryons B (and\n\nof course dropping the Y \u2261 B identification), one can easily construct models without\ntriplets. Development of these and similar ideas will be the subject of future work [47].\n\nOur results may also have applications in the context of gauge mediation and more\ngeneral supersymmetric technicolor model building as well. (See [48], and for some more\n18\n\n\fmodern work on the subject see [49-51] and references therein.) These mappings of operators could also be relevant in attempts to interpret the MSSM as the magnetic, low\nenergy, theory of some completely different degrees of freedom. (This idea is due to [30]\nand a relation to coupling constant unification was pointed out recently in [52].) Perhaps,\nsome of the applications for particle physics would require one to understand the map\nbeyond the \"probe approximation.\" Moving beyond this approximation would also be an\ninteresting theoretical question to investigate.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank O.
