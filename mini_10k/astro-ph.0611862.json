The planned Square Kilometer Array (SKA) may be\nable to map the mass with moderate signal-to-noise down to arcminute scales, depending on the reionization history of the universe and the ability to subtract foreground\nsources.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDark matter appears to be the dominant component of all structures larger than individual galaxies. In the standard paradigm\nits gravitational effects drive the linear growth and the subsequent nonlinear collapse of the fluctuations detected at z \u223c 1000\nin the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our inability to \"see\" the dark matter, and so to image its distribution, has\nprevented a definitive observational verification of this paradigm. Simulations of structure formation predict all galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters to sit within extended dark halos with regular and well-specified structural properties, but it has proved\ndifficult to test these predictions convincingly. As first demonstrated by Kaiser & Squires (1993) the distortion of the images\nof distant objects caused by gravitational lensing can be used to reconstruct an image of the foreground mass distribution.\nAll successful applications so far have used distant galaxies as the sources. The resolution and signal-to-noise of the resulting\nmaps are fundamentally limited by the abundance and intrinsic ellipticity of these sources. Even with deep satellite data the\neffective density of usable galaxies does not exceed about 100 per sq.arcmin. For a map with 1 arcmin pixels this corresponds\nto a signal-to-noise per pixel (ratio of rms expected physical fluctuation to rms noise fluctuation) of about 0.75; for 10 arcmin\npixels this ratio is about 2.5. As a result, only the centers of the most massive galaxy clusters can be detected at high signalto-noise in galaxy-based mass maps. In this paper we show that much higher resolution and effective signal-to-noise can, in\nprinciple, be achieved by using high redshift neutral hydrogen as the source, rather than galaxies.\nThere has been a great deal of interest in the possibility of observing the hyperfine transition of hydrogen (the 21 cm\n\n\f2\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nline) from the intergalactic (or pregalactic) medium at high redshift (see Furlanetto, Oh & Briggs 2006, for an extensive\nreview). There are two essentially disjoint epochs from which 21 cm radiation should be observable. At a redshift of z \u2243 300\nneutral hydrogen (HI) became thermally decoupled from the CMB. The gas kinetic temperature then fell below the CMB\ntemperature Tr due to their different adiabatic cooling laws. For a while the spin temperature Ts remained coupled to the\nkinetic temperature by atomic collisions, but at z \u223c 30 the collision rate became so low that the spin temperature decoupled\nfrom the kinetic temperature and returned to equilibrium with the CMB. During the period 30 < z < 300, Ts was below Tr\nand there was a net absorption of CMB photons through the 21 cm line. The observable quantity is the brightness temperature\nTb = (Ts \u2212Tr )(1\u2212e\u03c4 ) \u2243 (Ts \u2212Tr )\u03c4 which depends on the optical depth, \u03c4 , which is in turn proportional to the density of HI. A\nmap of Tb on the sky and in frequency would thus be a three dimensional map of the HI density, which is directly proportional\nto the mass density at these redshifts. The physics during this epoch of 21 cm absorption is simple, and predictions within\nthe standard cosmogony are straightforward and robust.\nThe second epoch with observable 21 cm effects is considerably less well characterized. It is known that almost all\nintergalactic hydrogen at z < 6.5 is ionized. It is believed that radiation from the first generation of stars and/or quasars\ncaused this reionization between z \u223c 6.5 and z \u223c 30. The latest CMB constraints give 8.5 < zreion < 22 at 68% confidence\n(Spergel et al. 2006). A variety of mechanisms will transfer energy from X-ray and/or Lyman-\u03b1 radiation to the HI gas during\nreionization, thereby raising Ts above the CMB temperature and making the 21 cm line visible in emission. After reionization\nis complete, too little HI is left to be observable. The mean free path for X-rays through the neutral IGM at z < 15 can\nexceed the Hubble length, so the spin temperature for much of the HI could have been raised uniformly before significant\nreionization occurred. Lyman-continuum radiation is expected to produce ionized bubbles that expand until they overlap.\nReionization finally completes as the last interbubble clumps are evaporated. During this period, Ly-\u03b1 radiation passes freely\nthrough ionized regions but is resonantly scattered in neutral regions, thereby raising their spin temperature and producing 21\ncm emission. How rapid and inhomogeneous this process was is highly uncertain and is likely to remain so until it is directly\nmeasured. It is also possible that shock heating of HI gas during the collapse of pregalactic objects could raise Ts enough for\n21 cm emission to be visible before reionization begins (Kuhlen, Madau & Montgomery 2006).\nGravitational lensing distorts our image of the 21 cm emission and absorption by moving the angular positions of points\non the sky while keeping the associated surface brightness (and thus brightness temperature) unchanged. For this reason a\nsmooth background radiation field is unaffected by lensing. The observed map of brightness temperature thus reflects both the\nintrinsic structure of the fluctuations and the lensing distortions. To separate the two, we use the fact that in a given direction\nthe intrinsic structure of maps at sufficiently separated frequencies (hence redshifts) will be statistically uncorrelated, while\nthe foreground lensing distribution will be the same. Below we show how the maps can be combined so as to average out\nthe intrinsic temperature fluctuations while preserving the lensing signal. In essence, the gradients of brightness temperature\nmaps at a set of sufficiently well-spaced frequencies are independently and isotropically distributed in the absence of lensing,\nbut display a coherence which is a direct measure of the lensing-induced shear when the foreground mass distribution is taken\ninto account.\nGravitational lensing of pregalactic 21 cm signals has previously been considered by several authors. In particular, Zahn\n& Zaldarriaga (2006) extended to 3-dimensions (angle on the sky + redshift of source) the techniques developed by Hu (2001)\nfor detecting lensing in the CMB, and they applied them to high-redshift 21 cm emission. In retrospect we find that the\nFourier-space version of the method presented here is related to their method (see Appendices B and C for details) and that\nour method is related to one developed by Seljak & Zaldarriaga (1999) for detecting lensing in the CMB. Cooray (2004) had\nalready discussed applying the original 2-dimensional Hu (2001) method to the 21 cm absorption epoch, but this misses the\nmain advantage offered by the radio technique, namely the large number of available quasi-independent source planes. Finally,\nPen (2004) discussed measuring gravitational lensing effects in the 21 cm emission by looking for anisotropic effects on the\nsecond order statistics of the brightness fluctuations. This does not estimate the gravitational shear directly by comparing\nmaps at different frequencies in the same direction, and so is much less sensitive than the approaches suggested here and by\nZahn & Zaldarriaga (2006).\nThe 21 cm emission/absorption has two major advantages over the CMB as a background source for lensing studies. Since\nlensing conserves surface brightness, it can only redistribute structure that already exists in the source. The CMB has very\n<\n1 arcmin) so that lensing effects are very weak. The second\nlittle structure on the angular scales where lensing is significant ( \u223c\nadvantage is that the CMB provides only one temperature field on the sky while the 21 cm emission/absorption provides\nmany, all of which are lensed by the same foreground mass distribution. Although the CMB comes from higher redshift, this\nis a relatively minor advantage since most of the structure detected by lensing is at much smaller redshift than either source.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section 2 an estimator for the gravitational shear is derived and in section 3 the noise\nin that estimator is discussed and quantified using a particular model for correlations in the 21 cm brightness temperature.\nThe expected lensing signal and the size of objects that could be detected are calculated in \u00a74. The prospects for measuring\ncosmological parameters with 21 cm lensing are discussed in section 5. The observational prospects given currently planned\ntelescope designs are discussed in \u00a76. In the appendices several technical issues are addressed and alternative methods for\nmeasuring the lensing signal are described.\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n2\n\nAN ESTIMATOR FOR THE GRAVITATIONAL SHEAR\n\nThe observed deviation in the brightness temperature of the 21 cm emission at a redshift z (or equivalently frequency \u03bd) and\na point on the sky, \u03b8~ will be denoted T (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd). We seek to construct a statistic from this temperature that, when summed over\nfrequency bands, \u03bd, preserves the lensing signal while smoothing out the fluctuations in T (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd). A statistic will have these\nproperties if it has the same properties when averaged over an ensemble of temperature fields at a fixed \u03bd while keeping the\nlensing contribution fixed. All statistics that are first-order in T (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) vanish with this averaging because of isotropy.\nWe will now show that it is possible to isolate the lensing contribution in the second order statistics of the gradient\n~ (~\nof the temperature field, \u2207T\n\u03b8, \u03bd). The small angle, or \"flat sky\", approximation will be used throughout this paper and is\n~ is the source\nwell justified for the angular scales that are considered. The observed temperature at a point on the sky, \u03b8,\ntemperature at \u03b8~\u2032 = ~\n\u03b8+\u03b1\n~ (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) plus noise, where ~\n\u03b8\u2032 is the position on the source plane (what the position would be in the\nabsence of lensing) and \u03b1\n~ (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) is the position shift caused by lensing (hereafter the deflection).

If the noise is isotropic it will drop out of both\nwhere \u03c3N\n(\u03bd) is the average of |N\n(11) and (12). This can be seen by expressing the noise vector in terms of its magnitude and polar angle and then requiring\nthat the direction be random. However, in general the noise may not be isotropic so we retain these terms. To lowest order\nthe first terms in the averages (11) and (12) are proportional to the gravitational shear and (13) is related to the convergence.\nThe lensing signal from a single redshift slice will be dominated by noise so we wish to add up frequency channels to\nreduce the noise. The convergence and shear are slowly varying functions of \u03bd at the high redshifts we are considering, so for\nnow we will assume \u03b3(~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) to be independent of \u03bd within the frequency band being used.

Except along exceptional lines of sight (through the very centers of galaxies\nand galaxy clusters) \u03ba(~\n\u03b8) is much smaller than one. As we show explicitly below, the variance \u03c3\u03ba2 is thus small, and (14) in\neffect provides an unbiased map of ~\u03b3 (~\n\u03b8) all the way back to the beginning of structure formation. We will sometimes refer to\n\u03b3\u0303i (~\n\u03b8) as the shear estimators even though the 3rd component is an estimator for the convergence, and \u03b3\u03033 (~\n\u03b8) will sometimes\nbe written as \u03ba\u0303(~\n\u03b8).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nNOISE LEVELS\nInstrumental, foreground and irreducible noise\n\nThere will be a number of sources of noise in the estimators (14). In particular, there will be noise from the instrumentation,\nfrom terrestrial interference, and from incomplete subtraction of galactic and extragalactic foreground emission. This noise is\n~ (~\nencapsulated in the N\n\u03b8, \u03bd) vector field. We will refer to these sources of noise collectively as foreground noise. It is expected\nthat foreground emission will be removed to high accuracy by using the fact that it varies slowly with frequency, whereas the\n21 cm emission/absorption signal (and particularly the angular gradient of this signal) decorrelates for even small separations\nalong the line-of-sight (see Zaldarriaga, Furlanetto & Hernquist 2004; Santos, Cooray, & Knox 2005). The removal process\ncould, however, leave noise with correlations in both frequency and position on the sky. For currently planned generations\nof instruments, this residual is expected to be as small as or smaller than the purely instrumental or thermal noise. The\nlensing signal is also coherent in frequency, but foreground subtraction will not effect it because lensing is multiplicative while\nwhile the foregrounds are additive, see equation (1). Lensing does not cause correlations between frequency channels, it causes\nspatial correlations within a frequency channel that are the same as in the other channels.\nIn addition to foreground noise there is noise from the randomness of the \u2207T (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) field itself. Clearly, this cannot be\nreduced by any improvement in technology or foreground subtraction, so we will refer to it as the irreducible noise. It depends\nonly on the intrinsic correlations in the 21 cm signals and on the range of frequency, or redshift, over which the signals are\nmapped. We will find that for any telescope which is able to map the 21 cm signals, the total noise in the shear estimate will\nautomatically be near the irreducible value. For this reason it is both a lower limit and a good benchmark.\nWe must also differentiate between the noise per pixel and the noise in the average \u03b3\u0303(~\n\u03b8) over a patch of sky which is\nlarger than the pixel size. By pixel we mean the smallest resolvable region of the sky as set by the telescope. If the angular\ncorrelations in the noise drop off more rapidly than the correlations in the shear, then the signal-to-noise ratio will be maximal\non an angular scale that is larger than the pixel size. We will refer to a region of sky over which \u03b3\u0303(~\n\u03b8) is averaged as a patch\nin the shear map. A patch could be a square region, a circular aperture, a gaussian smoothing window or any other localized\nwindow.\nThe variances in the magnitude of our shear estimators, (14), are given by\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (\u03b4\u0398)\n\n=\n\nZ Z\n\nd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u2032 W (~\n\u03b8; \u03b4\u0398)W (\u03b8~\u2032 ; \u03b4\u0398)\n\nXX\n\u03bd\n\n\u03bd\u2032\n\n\u03c9\u03bd \u03c9\u03bd \u2032\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\n~ i (\u03bd \u2032 , ~\n\u0393i (\u03bd, \u03b8)\u0393\n\u03b8\u2032 )\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n\u03c3\u03ba\u03032 (\u03b4\u0398)\n\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (\u03b4\u0398)\n\n=\n\nZ 3Z\n\n=\n\n(18)\n\nd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u2032 W (~\n\u03b8; \u03b4\u0398)W (\u03b8~\u2032 ; \u03b4\u0398)\n\nXX\n\u03bd\n\n\u03c9\u03bd \u03c9\u03bd \u2032\n\n\u03bd\u2032\n\n\u0002\n\n~ 3 (\u03bd \u2032 , ~\n\u03933 (\u03bd, \u03b8)\u0393\n\u03b8\u2032 ) \u2212 h\u03933 (\u03bd)i \u03933 (\u03bd \u2032 )\n\n\u0003\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\n\u03b8) and \u03b4\u0398 is its character\u03b8; \u03b4\u0398) is the window function defining the patch (normalized to one when integrated over ~\nwhere W (~\nistic angular scale.

To approach this noise level it is not necessary to eliminate all foreground\nnoise. Thus a telescope designed to map the brightness temperature will naturally achieve a noise level in \u03b3\u0303(~\n\u03b8) that is close\nto the irreducible value.

In\nthe limit of infinitely narrow bandwidths the sums in eq. (30) can be converted into integrals. The function A(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 , ~\n\u03b8) defines\na volume in frequency and angle within which the structure or noise is too strongly correlated to contribute \"independent\"\ninformation to the shear measurement. A very useful approximation to this volume can be found by calculating its characteristic\nlength in frequency at \u03b8 = 0 and its characteristic angular area at \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd.

One would like the data to be collected in frequency channels\nwith a width smaller than \u2206\u03bd\u2207 (\u03bd), otherwise the irreducible noise will be increased. Instrumental design or foreground noise\nactually result in there being an optimal bandwidth that is near \u2206\u03bd\u2207 (\u03bd) as will be shown in section 6.\nUsing the above definitions in (30) a simple approximation for the irreducible noise is found,\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (\u03b4\u0398) \u2243\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u03bd2\n\nd\u03bd\n\u03bd1\n\n1\n\u2206\u03bd\u2207 (\u03bd)N\u2207 (\u03bd, \u03b4\u0398)\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nWhen the patch size is very close to the pixel size the complete integrals in (26) must be carried out to obtain an accurate\nresult, but for the purposes of this section this is not necessary. The limit for small \u03b4\u0398 is the noise per pixel. It is easy to see\nfrom (36) and (35) that the square of the irreducible noise is essentially one over twice the number of correlated volumes in\na patch.\n2\nThe above estimates assume that \u03c3\u2207\n(\u03bd), the variance in the intrinsic temperature within a frequency channel, can be\nmeasured exactly so that the estimators \u03b3\u0303i can be normalized properly. This is normally a good approximation as we now\nshow. The variance in the gradient can be found by averaging over position on the sky in the entire surveyed region.

The frequency correlation length, \u2206\u03bd\u2207 (z), defined in equation (33) as a function of redshift. The power spectrum of 21 cm\nemission is taken to be the same as that of the dark matter, including linear velocity distortions and nonlinear structure formation. The\ndotted-dashed curve is for a gaussian pixel of radius \u03b4\u03b8 = 5 arcmin, the dotted curve is for 1 arcmin, the solid curve is for 0.5 arcmin,\nthe dot-dot-dot-dash curve is for 0.1 arcmin, and the dashed curve is for 0.05 arcmin (3 arcs). In the \u03b4\u03b8 = 0.05 arcmin case the decrease\nin the correlation length at small redshifts is caused by nonlinear structure formation. This effect is present in the other cases but to a\nlesser extent.\n\nFigure 2. The expected irreducible noise in the shear measurement per pixel. This is a plot of expression (36) with \u03b4\u0398 = 0 and assuming\na CDM dark matter power spectrum for the 21 cm brightness temperature.

The upper\nlimit of the redshift range used in the measurement is the abscissa, z2 . For each pixel size the five curves are for different lower redshift\nlimits. They are from left to right (or down to up) z1 = 6.5, 12, 22, 40 and 71.\n\nmuch better than the above. The correlations in the lensing convergence are relatively small (\u03c3\u03ba2 , \u03be\u03ba (\u03b8) \u226a 1) so the terms\ncontaining them on lines (38) and (39) can be safely ignored. The last term in (40) expresses the uncertainty in the mismatch\nbetween the average \u03ba (or \u03b3) over the survey region and the true average.\n2\nBy comparing (38)-(40) with equation (26) one can see that \u03c3K\n\u223c \u03a94 (\u2206\u03a9\u2207 \u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (0) + \u2206\u03a9\u03ba \u03c3\u03ba2 ) where \u2206\u03a9\u03ba is the area of sky\nover which the foreground convergence is correlated. (Note that \u2206\u03a9\u03ba is defined with one power of \u03be\u03ba (\u03b8) instead of two like\n\u2206\u03a9\u2207 ). Both these correlated areas could effectively be as small as the pixel if sparse pointings are used for normalizing \u03b3\u0303(~\n\u03b8).\n<\nIf a survey covers just a few independent regions and is capable of mapping the shear (so that \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 \u223c\n\u03c3\u03ba ), then the noise in the\nnormalization of the shear map will be small, and \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398), as obtained above, can be taken as the noise in the shear estimate.\n\n3.2\n\nCorrelations in the 21 cm emission\n\nThe irreducible noise in the shear map depends critically on the number of statistically independent regions of 21 cm emission/absorption along a single line-of-sight.

These are for a source redshift of z = 18.9, but all except the \u03b4\u03b8 = 0.05 arcmin case are very nearly\nindependent of redshift. The dashed curve is the result for the completely pixel-dominated Poisson process case.\n\nof the universe was dominated by ordinary matter so the comoving length between two redshifts is well approximated by the\nflat universe formula\nlco =\n\n2\n1/2\n\nHo \u03a9m (1 + z1 )1/2\n\n\u0014\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0010 1 + z \u00111/2 \u0015\n1\n\n1 + z2\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nBetween redshift 10 and 100, for example, lco = 2200h\u22121 Mpc for \u03a9m = 0.3, or 96.5h\u22121 Mpc in proper distance. Roughly\nspeaking, the correlation length (33) is \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 Mpc (comoving) for a pixel size of 0.5 arcmin in radius or smaller so we\nexpect of order 1,000 independent samples between these redshifts. A more detailed calculation must take into account the\nprecise form of the correlations in the brightness temperature.\nThe irreducible noise is independent of the normalization of the correlation function \u03be\u2207 (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03b8) and thus will depend only\non the shape of the 3-dimensional correlation function or power spectrum. During the early epoch of 21 cm absorption the\nbrightness temperature will be correlated in the same way as the dark matter (Loeb & Zaldarriaga 2004). During reionization\nthe correlations could be very different. One expectation is that \"bubbles\" of ionized gas will form and expand until they\nmerge. The size of the bubbles depends on the abundance and spatial distribution of sources of ionizing radiation; AGN\nproduce larger bubbles and stars smaller bubbles. These bubbles may or may not be smaller than the pixel \u2013 a 1 arcmin pixel\nhas a comoving width of 1.9 h\u22121 Mpc at z = 10. In what follows we make the assumption that the brightness temperature\nis proportional to the dark matter density even during reionization. We consider this conservative, because modifications to\nthe power spectrum during reionization are more likely to shorten the correlation length (and so to reduce the noise) than to\nincrease it. The contribution of ionized bubbles will increase the correlations on scales larger than the characteristic bubble\nsize and suppress them somewhat on scales smaller. There have been a number of attempts to model the fluctuations in the\nbrightness temperature during reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga & Hernquist 2004; Wyithe & Loeb 2004). We tried the\nsimple model of Santos et al. (2003) and find that it produces very little difference in the irreducible noise for \u03b4\u03b8 = 0.5 arcmin\nbecause the bubbles are significantly smaller than the pixel sizes. However, in the absence of either a complete theory of\nreionization or direct observations, the form of the temperature correlations remains a significant source of uncertainty in\nwhat follows, especially for small pixel sizes.\nThe brightness temperature in direction \u03b8~ and at frequency \u03bd is given by\nT (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) =\n\nZ\n\n2 \u2032\n\nd \u03b8\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8~\u2032 )q\u03bd (r \u2212 r(\u03bd)) .\ndr T21 \u03b81\u2032 D(\u03bd), \u03b82\u2032 D(\u03bd), r W (~\n\n\u0001\n\n(42)\n\nwhere q\u03bd (r) is the response function of the telescope expressed as a function of distance instead of frequency and r(\u03bd) is the\ncomoving distance to the redshift from which the 21 cm line is observed at frequency \u03bd. Since peculiar velocities will change\nthe observed frequencies of the 21 cm line, r(\u03bd) is not actually the radial distance, but rather the redshift expressed as a\ndistance.\nUsing this we can find the correlation function between the gradient of the temperature at different redshifts. This can\nbe done in spherical coordinates, but it comes out much more simply in the small angle approximation. The bandwidth will\ninitially be treated as infinitely narrow, q\u03bd (r) = \u03b4(r(\u03bd) \u2212 r) (see Appendix B and C for a treatment of finite bandwidths). The\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\nresult expressed as an integral over Fourier-space is\n\u03be\u2207 (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03b8)\n\n\u2207T (~\n\u03b8, \u03bd) * \u2207T (~\n\u03b8\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 )\n\n\u2261\n=\n\nZ\n\nr(\u03bd)r(\u03bd \u2032 )\n\n0\n\nwith\nW(k, r(\u03bd), r(\u03bd \u2032 ), \u03b8)\n\nZ\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n\n(43)\n\ndk\nk4 P21 (k, \u03bd) W(k, r(\u03bd), r(\u03bd \u2032 ), \u03b8)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nh\n\ndx (1 + \u03b2x2 )2 (1 \u2212 x2 ) cos k\u2206r(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )x J0 k r(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )\u03b8\n\nh\n\n\u00d7 W\u0303 k r(\u03bd)\n\np\n\ni\n\nh\n\n\u0002\n\n1 \u2212 x2 W\u0303 k r(\u03bd \u2032 )\n\np\n\n\u0003\n\n1 \u2212 x2\n\ni\u2217\n\n,\n\np\n\n1 \u2212 x2\n\ni\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u2206r(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) = r(\u03bd) \u2212 r(\u03bd \u2032 ), r(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) = (r(\u03bd) + r(\u03bd \u2032 )) /2 and P21 (k, \u03bd) is the 3-dimensional power spectrum of the 21 cm\nbrightness temperature. It has been assumed that the power spectrum, P21 (k, \u03bd), does not change significantly over the range\nin \u03bd where there are significant correlations. The linear redshift distortions (Kaiser 1987) are responsible for the \u03b2 term. The\nparameter \u03b2 is given by \u03b2 = \u03a9m (z)0.6 /b(z)2 to a very good approximation, where b(z) is the bias between the matter and the\nT21 fluctuations and \u03a9m (z) is the density of matter in units of the critical density at that time. Here we have assumed that\nP21 (k) = b2 Pmatter (k) and is thus proportional to the matter power spectrum. In the calculations that follow we take b = 1,\nas expected at least during the early epoch of 21 cm absorption.\nWith this result and with an assumed pixel profile the frequency correlation length (33), the angular correlation area (34)\nand the irreducible noise (36) can all be calculated. The nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum is of some significance\nfor the smaller pixel widths considered here. To account for this we use the Peacock & Dodds (1996) method to convert the\nlinear power spectrum to a nonlinear one.\nFigure 1 shows \u2206\u03bd\u2207 (z) as a function of redshift for a circular gaussian pixel with various radii \u03b4\u03b8. The decrease in \u2206\u03bd\u2207 (z)\nwith increasing redshift is largely the result of a fixed comoving distance corresponding to a smaller frequency interval at\nhigher redshift. The correlation length also increases with increasing pixel size, but it is always less then 0.4 MHz, even when\nthe pixel is 5 arcmin in radius.\nThe irreducible noise per pixel, \u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (0), is shown in figure 2 for a few pixel sizes and ranges in redshift. It can be seen that\nsmaller pixel sizes give smaller irreducible noise per pixel. It is not yet clear over what range in z the 21 cm emission/absorption\nwill be detectable. This depends on the history of reionization, on the subtraction of foregrounds and on telescope sensitivity.\nIf the reionization epoch lasts from z \u223c 10 to 20 and this whole redshift range can be observed, then the expected irreducible\nnoise is 2% for a \u03b4\u03b8 = 0.5 arcmin pixel and 0.6% for a 3 arcsec pixel. The early epoch of 21 cm absorption lasts from\nz \u223c 30 \u2212 300. If this whole range could be observed, then we expect \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (0) = 1.7% and 0.6% for the same pixel sizes. It is\npossible that both epochs of emission/absorption will someday be observable, reducing the noise still further.\nThe angular correlation function at fixed frequency is shown in figure 3 for several different pixel sizes. To a good\napproximation, the correlation function scales as\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03be\u2207 (\u03b8, \u03bd)\n2\n\u03c3\u2207\n(\u03bd)\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2243 4f\u01eb f\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b8\n,\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\n\u0011\n\n(45)\n\nR\n\nwhere f\u01eb is a constant. The somewhat awkward normalization is chosen so that 2\u03c0 xf (x)dx = 1 and f\u01eb is unity to within\na few % if the brightness temperature follows the CDM density field. We retain f\u01eb as a fudge factor which could differ\nsignificantly from one if brightness temperature is not distributed like mass. This approximate scaling is a result of the power\nspectrum being almost scale-free on the relevant scales. It is a very useful approximation with important consequences, because\nit means that the smaller the pixel, the lower the irreducible noise for a fixed area on the sky. The scaling can be understood\nby considering the limiting case where the temperature is a Poisson process with correlations only on scales much smaller\nthan the pixel so that the pixelization dominates the observed correlations. In this case\n1\nf (x) =\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nx2\n1\u2212\n4\n\n\u00132\n\ne\u2212x\n\n2\n\n/2\n\n(46)\n\nand f\u01eb = \u03c0/4. This limiting case is also shown in figure 3. The angular correlation is very nearly frequency independent\nbecause comoving angular size distance is a slow function of redshift at these high redshifts, and because the power spectrum\nof temperature fluctuations does not change shape during linear evolution. There is some dependence on \u03bd for the smallest\npixel radius (\u03b4\u03b8 = 0.05 arcmin) reflecting nonlinear structure formation effects on these small scales (\u223c 100 kpc) at the lower\nredshifts. The correlation area is a simple function of \u03b4\u03b8, to a very good approximation \u2206\u03a9\u2207 \u2243 4f\u01eb \u03b4\u03b82 . Note that we use the\nradius of the gaussian to characterize the pixel rather than its full width at half maximum (fwhm).\nBecause of this simple scaling of correlated area with pixel size, a simple expression for the irreducible noise per patch\ncan be found\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (\u03b4\u0398)\n\n\u2243\n\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (0)N\u2207\n\n(47)\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nFigure 4.

The scaling as \u03b4\u0398\u22122 on large scales just reflects the\nfact that correlations in temperature gradient are negligible on scales significantly larger than the pixel. The prefactor might\nbe different if brightness temperature turns out not to be distributed like dark matter density. If the brightness temperature\ncorrelations have strongly non-power-law behavior on the relevant scales, then f\u01eb will show some dependence on the pixel size.\nFor example, if the temperature distribution were smooth on small scales, then making the pixel smaller would provide no\nfurther information and the noise would not continue to decrease with pixel size. As mentioned before, the correlation length\nmight also be smaller during reionization, in which case \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398) might also be smaller. This effect must be minor, however,\nsince the correlation length cannot be smaller than for the completely pixel-dominated Poisson case and, as figure 3 shows,\nthis is only slightly smaller than that of our standard model.\nIn Appendix C we present an alternative derivation of the noise in Fourier or visibility-space that agrees very well with\nthe one given here.\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n\n\u221a\nFigure 6.

Guided\nby figure 2, we have taken them to be 0.05, 0.03, 0.02 and 0.007 respectively.\n\n4\n\nTHE EXPECTED SIGNAL AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATTER\n\n4.1\n\nSignal-to-noise estimates\n\nWe now need to determine whether there will be enough signal on the appropriate angular scales to produce a high fidelity\nmap of the shear. This requires the noise to be significantly lower than \"typical\" values of the shear. We quantify the latter\nby calculating the root mean square value of the shear along random lines of sight.\nThe distortion matrix introduced in section 2 can be written in terms of derivatives of the Newtonian potential, \u03c6(~x),\nalong the light path. To a good approximation the unperturbed light path can be used (the first Born approximation) which\nresults in\n\u03b1ij (~\n\u03b8, z) =\n\n\u22122\n\nwith\ng(r, r \u2032 ) \u2261\n\nR r(z)\n\ndr \u2032 g (r(z), r \u2032 )\n\n0\n\nR\n\nd2 x \u22a5 W\n\n\u0010\n\n~ \u03b4\u0398\n\u2212 \u03b8;\n\nx\u22a5\n~\nD(r \u2032 ,0)\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22022\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\n\u03c6(~x\u22a5 , r \u2032 )\n\n(49)\n\nD(r \u2032 , 0)D(r, r \u2032 )\n,\nD(r, 0)\n\nwhere r is the radial coordinate distance, D(r, r \u2032 ) is the angular size distance between the two coordinate distances and\nW (~\n\u03b8; \u03b4\u0398) is still the angular window on the sky. Sometimes the distances to the source redshift, to the lens redshift and\nbetween them will be abbreviated as Ds , Dl and Dls , respectively. The coordinate vector perpendicular to the line-of-sight is\n~x\u22a5 .

The first equality follows from the shear being a homogeneous potential field to first order.\nThe window will be taken to be a gaussian to conform with our results in section 3.2.\nFigure 4 shows \u03c3\u03ba (z) as a function of source redshift for windows of different widths. The expected fluctuations in \u03ba are\nat the many percent level for redshifts between 10 and 300 (for a 1 arcmin pixel 4% to 6%, for a 3 arcsec pixel 7.5% to 11%).\nReducing the pixel size can increase the signal substantially. By comparing this figure with figure 2 we see that for a pixel\n\np\n\n11\n\n\f12\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nFigure 7. The mass detection limits for NFW halos as a function of redshift. The dotted curves are 1\u03c3 and the solid curves are 2\u03c3\ndetections of the tangential shear in a circle centered on the halo. The lowest set of four curves are for a pixel size of 0.05 arcmin,\n\u03c3\u03b3\u0303 = 0.007 and source redshifts of 10 and 100. The middle set of four curves are for a pixel size of 0.5 arcmin and \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 = 0.02. The convex\nfeatures in the curves at high redshift are a result of the requirement that the circle be larger then the pixel size. The dashed curves are\n2\u03c3 estimates for galaxy lensing surveys with the density of galaxies being, top, 35 arcmin\u22122 (typical of a ambitious ground based survey\nsuch as LSST or the DUNE satellite) and 100 arcmin\u22122 (perhaps achievable over a small region with a satellite such as SNAP).\n\nsize of 1 arcmin or smaller and with a moderate redshift range the irreducible noise per pixel is less than half the expected\nsignal. Figure 5 shows which redshifts contribute most to \u03c3\u03ba2 (z) for source redshifts of 1, 10 and 100. It can be seen that\nstructures above z = 2 contribute significantly in both 21 cm cases, whereas structure around z \u223c 0.5 dominates in the galaxy\nlensing case. If the shear could be measured accurately using signals from both epochs of 21 cm emission/absorption, one\ncould expect to isolate the contribution from structure at z \u223c 10, since this contributes significantly to the signal for source\nredshift 100. In these calculations the nonlinear power spectrum was modeled using the Peacock & Dodds (1996) method\nwith a normalization of \u03c38 = 0.75. Note that for the smaller pixels especially, the distribution of \u03ba is strongly nongaussian,\nand the variance plotted in fig. 4 is substantially larger than a typical fluctuation because of the long tail to high \u03ba values\n(see Hilbert et al. (2007).\nFigure 6 shows \u03c3|\u03b3| (\u03b4\u0398) and \u03c3\u03ba\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398) as functions of angular scale for observations averaged over patches larger than the\npixel. The fluctuations in shear drop off relatively slowly with increasing angular scale while at scales much larger than the\npixel size \u03c3\u03ba\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398) \u221d \u03b4\u0398\u22121 . As a result even if the noise per pixel is comparable to \u03c3\u03ba the shear can still be mapped with high\nsignal-to-noise on scales larger than the pixel. With small noise per pixel, the surface density averaged over large scales can\nbe measured with high precision. Note that the normalizations of \u03c3\u03ba\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398) in this plot depend on the redshift range over which\nthe 21 cm emission and absorption are measured. We have chosen representative values as listed in the caption.\n4.2\n\nDetection of individual objects\n\nWe have shown that 1\u03c3 fluctuations in the convergence could be detected with modest to good signal-to-noise (depending\non pixel size) by a 21 cm experiment. Another interesting question is what kind of objects would be individually visible in\na 21 cm shear map. To answer this question let us consider a circle of radius \u03b8 on the sky centered on a collapsed clump or\nhalo. The average tangential shear on this circle is given by\n\u03b3 t (\u03b8) =\n\n4\u03c0G Dls\nc2 Dl Ds\n\n\u0012\n\nM (\u03b8)\n1 \u2202M (\u03b8)\n\u2212\n\u03c0\u03b82\n\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere M (\u03b8) is the mass within the circle. The average tangential shear within a disk can be found from this. For halos with\nan NFW profile (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997) we find, as a function of virial mass and halo redshift, the radius where\nthe signal-to-noise for the average tangential shear is maximized. The central density and the scale-size are set according to\nthe NFW prescription. If the disk is smaller than the pixel, the tangential component of the shear will not be identifiable.\nThus although these halos might cause a significant feature in the shear map, we will not consider a halo detected unless the\nsignal-to-noise is above a 1 or 2-\u03c3 threshold within a circle with a radius at least as large as the pixel size. The halo mass\ndetection limit is plotted in figure 7. With a 3 arcsec pixel this threshold is below 1012 M\u2299 almost all the way out to the\nredshift of the 21 cm emission/absorption and < 2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 below z = 1. This is smaller than the mass of the Milky Way\nhalo today. Note that these are virial masses, not the mass enclosed within the circle. The latter is the directly detected mass\nand can be significantly smaller.\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n\nFigure 8. The fractional error in the convergence power spectrum for a full-sky survey due to irreducible noise and cosmic variance.\nThe solid and dashed curves are for 21 cm lensing with sources at z = 100 and z = 10 respectively, assuming a 0.5 arcmin pixel radius\nand \u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (0) = 0.03. The two dot-dashed curves are for galaxy lensing surveys with median source redshift z = 1 and with 35 (upper) and\n100 (lower) galaxies per square arcmin. The dotted curve which is just visible in the lower right corner, but otherwise is covered\np by the\nsolid curve is the cosmic variance limit. For a smaller area survey these curves scale with the fraction of sky covered like 1/ fsky for\nmodes that are smaller than the surveyed region.\n\nTaking the average tangential shear over a disk is not the best method for detecting halos. One could do somewhat better\nby assuming a model for their radial profiles and deriving an optimal weighting function (Schneider 1996). Here, however,\nwe restrict ourselves to the question of what objects would be clearly visible in a shear map without any further special\nprocessing.\nFor comparison we calculate a similar mass limit for idealized future galaxy lensing surveys. In this case the noise in\nthe average shear in a patch of radius \u0398 is \u03c3 2 = \u03c3\u01eb2 /(\u03c0\u03982 ng ) (half this for just the tangential component) where ng is the\nangular number density of background galaxies and \u03c3\u01eb is the root-mean-squared intrinsic ellipticity of those galaxies; we use\nthe standard estimate \u03c3\u01eb = 0.3. The shear strength depends on the redshift distribution of background galaxies with usable\n1.5\ndn\nellipticities. Here we model the redshift distribution as dzg \u221d z 2 e\u2212(z/zo ) , where zo is set by the desired median redshift.\nThe shear (52) must then be averaged over the portion of this distribution that is at higher redshift than the lens plane. Halo\ndetection limits calculated in this way are also shown in figure 7.\nA very deep space-based galaxy lensing survey might be competitive with a \u223c 1 arcmin pixel 21 cm lensing survey for\ndetecting halos at z < 1. The proposed satellite SNAP1 is expected to survey \u223c 2% of the sky with an expected galaxy\ndensity of ng \u2243 100 arcmin\u22122 and a median redshift z \u223c 1.23. The DUNE2 satellite proposes surveying \u223c 50% of the sky with\nng \u2243 35 arcmin\u22122 and a median redshift of z \u223c 0.9. Several proposed ground based surveys \u2013 LSST3 , PanSTARRS4, VISTA5\nwould cover comparable areas to DUNE at similar depth. These are the two cases shown in figure 7. Clearly higher redshifts\nwill be accessible with 21 cm lensing. With a small pixel size, 21 cm lensing could detect all Milky Way mass halos in the\nuniverse! Based on the Sheth & Tormen (2002) halo mass function, for the same sky coverage \u223c 600 times more objects could\nbe identified by such a survey than in a space-based galaxy shear map with ng = 100 arcmin\u22122 and \u223c 3, 500 times more than\nin a ground-based galaxy shear survey with ng = 30 arcmin\u22122 . Mass maps of galaxy clusters could be made with arcsecond\nresolution and high signal-to-noise, instead of with arcminute resolution and relatively low S/N as is possible using galaxy\nlensing. Galaxy halo studies, which now require stacking thousands of galaxies to measure a single average shear profile, could\nbe carried out on individual galaxies.\n\n5\n\nESTIMATING COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS FROM THE LENSING POWER SPECTRUM\n\nAs we have shown, high-resolution, high signal-to-noise shear maps could be made using 21 cm lensing. These maps will contain\na wealth of information which can be used not only to learn about structure formation, but also to estimate cosmological\nparameters. We will make a preliminary foray into this latter topic in order to compare the power of 21 cm lensing to that of\ngalaxy lensing. A useful study of the the capability of planned galaxy lensing surveys for cosmological parameter estimation\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nsnap.lbl.gov\nwww.dune-mission.net\nwww.lsst.org\npan-stars.ifa.hawaii.edu\nwww.vista.ac.uk\n\n13\n\n\f14\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nhas recently been published by Amara & Refregier (2006) and we will adopt their survey parameters in the following in order\nto facilitate comparison between the two techniques.\nFigures 4 and 5 show clearly that the strength of gravitational lensing depends on source redshift. This suggests that\nadditional information may be extracted by comparing shear maps derived from sources at different redshifts - either multiple\n21 cm source planes, or multiple galaxy source planes, or a combination of the two. Such weak lensing tomography has already\nbeen proposed for galaxy lensing surveys as a method to measure the evolution of structure and thereby to constrain the\nnature of dark energy (Hu & Tegmark 1999; Hu 2002; Heavens 2003; Castro, Heavens & Kitching 2005). In this context 21 cm\nlensing has the potential advantages of superior signal-to-noise, higher source redshift and better angular resolution. On the\n<\nother hand, most models of dark energy affect structure formation and the cosmic expansion rate primarily at z \u223c\n1 where\ngalaxy lensing tomography is most sensitive. As we show below, a combination of galaxy and 21 cm lensing appears likely to\nconstrain dark energy parameters most effectively.\nFor the purposes of cosmological parameter estimation it is convenient to work in spherical harmonic or Fourier space.\nThe cross-correlation between the harmonic modes of two shear maps, corresponding to source planes at redshifts z1 and z2 ,\ncan be derived from equation (49) and is directly related to the power spectrum of density fluctuations\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nh\u03b31 (l, zi )\u03b31 (l\u2032 , zj )i\ncos2 (2\u03b8l )\n\u2032\n\uf8f8 \u03ba(l, zi )\u03ba(l\u2032 , zj )\nh\u03b32 (l, zi )\u03b32 (l , zj )i = \uf8ed\nsin2 (2\u03b8l )\n\u2032\nh\u03b31 (l, zi )\u03b32 (l , zj )i\ncos(2\u03b8l ) sin(2\u03b8l )\n\n(53)\n\nwith\n\n\u03ba(l, zi )\u03ba(l\u2032 , zj ) = (2\u03c0)2 \u03b4 2 (l \u2212 l\u2032 )P\u03baij (l)\n\n(54)\n\nand\nP\u03baij (l)\n\n=\n\nh3\n\n2\n\nHo2 \u03a9m\n\ni2 Z\n\nmin(r1 ,r2 )\n\ndr \u2032\n\n0\n\ng(r(zi), r \u2032 )g(r(zj ), r \u2032 )\n(1 + z \u2032 )2 P\u03b4\nD(r \u2032 )2\n\n\u0010l\u0011\nD\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere l and l\u2032 are the multipole indices in the two maps. Using (53) the shear (cross-)power spectrum is trivially converted\ninto the convergence (cross-)power spectrum.\nThe observed shear power spectrum of a lensing map contains a contribution from the irreducible noise, but this term is\nabsent in the cross-correlation between maps for different source redshifts, since the noise fields in the two source planes are\nthen independent.

As a result f \u0303(l\u03b4\u03b8)\n<\nis close to unity for any l \u223c\n1/\u03b4\u03b8 and it decreases rapidly for larger l. We will restrict ourselves to modes larger than the\n2 2\npixel (i.e. l\u03b4\u03b8 \u226a 1) in which case both e\u22122\u03b4\u03b8 l and f \u0303(l\u03b4\u03b8) will drop out of C\u03baij (l). Line (61) shows the result for the pixel\ndominated Poisson case discussed in section 3.2.\nThe shear power spectrum from galaxy lensing has the same form except there is no pixel. It is often assumed that the\nnoise in this case is dominated by the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies in which case the noise power spectrum is N\u03ba (l) = \u03c3\u01eb2 /ng\n(Kaiser 1992). In practice errors in the photometric redshifts of the source galaxies are often important, but here we will assume\nan ideal survey where these are not significant.\nSo far no assumption of Gaussian statistics in the shear field has been made in this section. Although our estimator \u03b3\u0303(~\n\u03b8) is\nnot Gaussian, we have shown that the correlation length of the irreducible noise should be close to the pixel size. The multipole\nmoments for scales larger than the pixel size are then sums of many independent variables and, by the central limit theorem,\nare expected to be approximately normally distributed. The shear map itself will also have substantial non-gaussianity caused\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\nby nonlinear structure, even for Gaussian initial density fluctuations. However, on scales larger than individual dark halos\nthe shear map is expected to be close to Gaussian because of contributions from many independent structures along the long\nline-of-sight (Takada & Jain 2004).\nFor a Gaussian shear map the likelihood function factorizes by mode, making the analysis much simpler. The Fisher\nmatrix in this case is\nFab =\n\nlmax\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 X\n(2l + 1)fsky tr C\u22121 C,a C\u22121 C,b ,\n2\n\n(62)\n\nl=lmin\n\n(formula (62) in appendix A) where the indices a and b refer to parameters pa and pb and fsky is the fraction of the sky\ncovered (Hu 1999). The fsky factor can be interpreted as the result of limited resolution in visibility-space because of the finite\nsize of the radio telescope's pixel. It is assumed here that the coverage of the u-v plane is complete between lmin and lmax\ndown to the resolution of the telescope. The smallest scale mode, lmax , is chosen so that the Gaussian assumption remains\napproximately valid. The minimum variance unbiased estimator of pa then has statistical uncertainty \u03c3 2 (pa ) = (F\u22121 )aa , so\nthis quantity can be used to indicate how well the parameter pa can be constrained.\nDirectly from (62) one finds that the power spectrum of the fluctuations in \u03ba can be determined to accuracy\n\u2206P\u03ba (l) =\n\nr\n\n2 2\n2\nP\u03ba (l) + 4\u03b4\u03b82 \u03c3\u03b3\u03032 (0)f\u01eb f \u0303 (l\u03b4\u03b8) e2\u03b4\u03b8 l\n(2l + 1)fsky\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(63)\n\nusing only one epoch of 21 cm lensing. This formula holds on scales between that of the survey area, where windowing effects\ncause the noise to increase sharply, and that of the pixel size. Figure 8 shows the uncertainty in the \u03ba power spectrum given\nby this formula. Not shown in the figure is the l-space resolution which is \u2206l \u223c fsky . The errors in the power spectrum for l\nseparated by less then \u2206l will be correlated (see appendix A for more details). The cosmic variance (or sample variance for\na partial sky survey) is likely to dominate the uncertainty over all linear scales. This illustrates a fundamental limitation of\nmeasuring cosmological parameters from the convergence power spectra and cross-power spectra. Decreasing the instrumental\nand/or irreducible noise does not provide any further information about the ensemble power spectrum of \u03ba although it does\nprovide more information on the particular realization that we live in. Modes with l < 104 will be cosmic variance limited\nif \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (0)\u03b4\u03b8 < 0.017 arcmin for sources at z = 10. For modes with l < 103 the same is true if \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (0)\u03b4\u03b8 < 0.12 arcmin. When\nestimating cosmological parameters there is no reason to decrease the noise below these values, as long as the Gaussian\nassumption holds and one is only interested in these modes. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the cosmic variance limit\non the 3D power spectrum has been reached. More information can be gained by splitting the source redshift range up. This\nincreases the noise for each subrange, but accesses the additional tomographic information that is averaged out when using\nthe full redshift range to make a single shear map.\nTo proceed we must choose a cosmological parameter space for exploration, a fiducial model to perturb around, and\nobservational parameters for a set of representative surveys. For simplicity and for ease of comparison we follow the galaxy\nsurvey parameters chosen by Amara & Refregier (2006). In the current standard paradigm, the apparently accelerating\nexpansion of the present universe is driven by dark energy, a near-uniform and dominant component of the cosmic energy\ndensity with effective equation of state p = w\u03c1 where w < \u22121/3 (Riess et al. 2004; Astier et al. 2006; Spergel et al. 2006).\nDark energy modifies the lensing signal due to cosmic structure in two ways. It affects the angular size distance to a given\nredshift, which is given by the expression\nr(z) =\n\n1\nHo\n\nwhere\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032\n,\nE(z \u2032 )\n\n(64)\n\nE(z) = \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b (1 + z)3(1+w) + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m \u2212 \u03a9\u039b )(1 + z)2\n\n\u0002\n\n\u00031/2\n\n.\n\n(65)\n\nHere \u03a9\u039b denotes the dark energy density today in units of the critical density, and w has been assumed to be constant. The\nsecond effect of dark energy results from its influence on the linear evolution of density fluctuations, which is given by\nd2 \u03b4\n+\nd ln a2\n\n\u0012\n\nd ln E(a)\n2+\nd ln a\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03b4\n3 \u03a9m\n\u2212\n\u03b4 = 0.\nd ln a\n2 a3 E(a)2\n\n(66)\n\nIn addition to \u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b and w, we include in our cosmological parameter set the logarithmic slope or spectral index of the\nprimordial power spectrum, ns , the density of baryons, \u03a9b , and the normalization of the power spectrum on large scales A,\nwhich is proportional to \u03c382 . The baryon oscillations in the power spectrum are not calculated, so \u03a9b only effects the overall\nshape. Note that we do not restrict ourselves to flat cosmologies, but we do fix the Hubble constant to Ho = 70 km/s/Mpc,\nassuming this to be externally determined.\nFigures 9 and 10 show predicted error ellipses for various pairs of our set of six cosmological parameters and for various\ncombinations of idealized 21 cm and galaxy lensing surveys.

The dashed blue ellipses are for a deeper survey with ng = 100 arcmin\u22122 ,\n\u03c3\u01eb = 0.3 and a median redshift of z = 1.23. It would take the SNAP satellite roughly 30 years to complete a full-sky survey to the deeper\ndepth. In all cases the galaxies are divided into three redshift bins as described in the text. The solid green ellipses are for shear maps\nfrom 21 cm alone at redshifts z = 10 and 15. The dashed green ellipses are for the \"optimal\" 21 cm case with shear maps constructed\nfor z = 10, 30 and 100.

For each plot we\nhave marginalized over the remaining four parameters of our model set. In Table 1 we give corresponding 1\u03c3 uncertainties\non individual parameters after marginalizing over the other five dimensions of our parameter space. The galaxy redshift\ndistributions assumed here are the same as described at the end of section 4.2. When the galaxies are binned into several\nredshift intervals, we define these so as to obtain an equal number of galaxies in each bin. We also assume the full sky to be\n\u22120.5\nsurveyed in all cases; for partial sky coverage the sizes of the uncertainties are approximately increased by a factor of fsky\n.\nApart from fixing the Hubble constant, no additional constraints from other observations are included.\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n\nFigure 10. Blow-ups of the plots in figure 9.\n\nIn agreement with Amara & Refregier (2006) we find that a ambitious galaxy lensing survey could determine \u03a9\u039b and ns\nwith an accuracy of about \u223c 0.01, \u03a9b with an accuracy of about 0.004, \u03a9m with an accuracy of about 0.0025 and w, with\nan accuracy of about 0.03. An ideal survey going to a depth corresponding to 100 source galaxies per square arcminute over\nthe whole sky (requiring about 30 years with the specifications of the SNAP satellite) would reduce these uncertainties by\nabout a factor of two. Surveys covering only a fraction fsky of the sky, would have uncertainties increased approximately in\n\u22121/2\nproportion to fsky .\nWhile these numbers are impressive, shear maps derived from 21 cm alone can provide considerably tighter constraints.\nAll-sky maps derived from the signal around z = 10 and z = 15 will be limited by cosmic variance if their resolution and\nnoise properties satisfy \u03c3\u03b3\u0303 (0)\u03b4\u03b8 < 0.017 arcmin, and will then determine \u03a9m to an accuracy of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 , \u03a9\u039b to an accuracy\nof 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and w to an accuracy of 0.004. An ideal survey with source planes around z = 10, 30 and 100 would reduce\nthese even further, with \u2206\u03a9m \u223c 10\u22124 , \u2206\u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.0002, \u2206\u03a9b \u223c 0.0005, and \u2206w \u223c 0.001.\nSome parameter constraints are substantially improved by combining galaxy and 21 cm lensing, although most of the\nstatistical weight comes from the latter. Thus combining the shallower galaxy survey considered above with the 21 cm survey\nat z = 10 and 15, one finds that \u03a9\u039b , A, ns and \u03a9b are constrained about as well as by the 21 cm alone, while w is constrained\nalmost six times better and \u03a9m four times better. Constraints on dark energy parameters are improved by including the\ngalaxy lensing because dark energy primarily affects structure evolution at z < 1. On the other hand, galaxy lensing alone\ngives comparatively poor constraints on these parameters unless a prior constraint on \u03a9m is included. For parameters that\naffect only the matter power spectrum (e.g. ns ) 21 cm lensing has a larger comparative advantage. Of course it is not a\nquestion of one or the other. Clearly it is worth doing both galaxy and 21 cm lensing surveys to maximize the information\ngained and to spread the risk from unanticipated systematics.\nIt should be emphasized that this analysis does not exhaust the potential for constraining cosmological parameters using\n21 cm or galaxy lensing. The dark energy model used here is overly simplified and may be unrealistic; some more physically\nbased models imply appreciable effects at redshifts well beyond unity and so may be particularly well constrained by 21 cm\nsurveys (Caldwell et al. 2003; Doran, Schwindt & Wetterich 2001). Other datasets, notably CMB observations and supernova\nsurveys, constrain cosmological parameters in different ways than gravitational lensing, and will be much improved by the\ntime surveys of the type discussed in this section are completed. Combining results from all these sources will give stringent\ntests for the presence of systematics and will provide tighter and more robust final constraints if overall consistency is found.\nOur knowledge of many cosmological parameters is limited by degeneracies which are drastically reduced when different types\nof observation are combined in this way.\n\n17\n\n\f18\n6\n\nMetcalf & White\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nSo far we have considered idealized observations where the irreducible noise dominates and the bandwidth is smaller than the\nintrinsic correlation length of the brightness temperature. This will be the best any experiment can do and, as we showed,\nwill be reached when the noise in the temperature map is small compared to the temperature fluctuations in each frequency\nchannel. This irreducible noise depends only on the shape of the temperature correlation function. Realistic observations, at\nleast in the near future, will have foreground noise levels that are comparable to or larger than the intrinsic fluctuations in\nthe brightness temperature. In this case the noise in the lensing map will depend more sensitively on the parameters of the\ntelescope and on the level and statistical properties of the brightness temperature fluctuations. We now discuss these factors\nin more detail.\nThe observations will be carried out with radio interferometers and thus in visibility space. As a result, when calculating\nthe performance of telescopes it is easier to work in Fourier-space. For this section we adopt the formalism of appendix C for\nconvenience. Equations (C7) and (C10) give the noise in the \u03ba estimate as a function of the power spectrum of foreground\nnoise, ClN (\u03bd), and the power spectrum of the brightness temperature, C l (\u03bd).\nThe noise in each visibility will have a thermal component and a component from imperfect foreground subtraction. We\nwill model only the thermal component. If the telescopes in the array are uniformly distributed on the ground the average\nintegration time for each baseline will be the same and the power spectrum of the noise will be\nClN\n\n2\u03c0\n=\n\u2206\u03bdto\n\n\u0012\n\nTsys \u03bb\nfcover Dtel\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\n2\n(2\u03c0)3 Tsys\n2\n\u2206\u03bdto fcover lmax (\u03bd)2\n\n(67)\n\n(Zaldarriaga et al. 2004; Morales 2005; McQuinn et al. 2006) where Tsys is the system temperature, \u2206\u03bd is the bandwidth, to\nis the total observation time, Dtel is the diameter of the array and lmax (\u03bb) = 2\u03c0Dtel /\u03bb is the highest multipole that can be\nmeasure by the array as set by the largest baselines. fcover is the total collecting area of the telescopes divided by \u03c0(Dtel /2)2 ,\nthe covering fraction. Other telescope configurations are possible which would make the noise unequally distributed in l, but\nwe will consider only this uniform configuration here. For our calculations we will use Tsys = 200 K.\nThere are several relevant telescopes proposed or under construction. The 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA, formerly known\nas PAST) has fcover \u223c 0.1 and lmax \u223c 103 giving it a resolution of about 10 arcmin. The Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) Low\nFrequency Demonstrator (LFD)6 will operate in the 80-300 MHz range with Dtel \u2243 1.5 km and fcover \u223c 0.1. For LOFAR (Low\nFrequency Array)7 the core array will have fcover \u223c 0.016 and Dtel \u223c 2 km. LOFAR's extended baselines, out to 350 km and\npossibly larger, are not expected to be useful for high redshift 21 cm observations because of the small fcover of the extended\narray, although they will be used in foreground subtraction. It is anticipated that it will be able to detect 21 cm emission\nout to a redshift of z \u2243 11.5, but sensitivity limitations will make mapping very difficult. Plans for SKA (Square Kilometer\nArray)8 have not been finalized, but it is expected to have fcover \u223c 0.02 out to a diameter of \u223c 6 km (lmax \u223c 104 ) and sparse\ncoverage extending out to 1,000-3,000 km. The lowest frequency currently anticipated is \u223c 100 MHz which corresponds to\nz \u223c 13. It is anticipated that the core will be able to map the 21 cm emission with a resolution of \u03b4\u03b8 = \u2206\u03b8/2 \u223c 0.5 arcmin.\nFor reference what we call the pixel-width is given by \u2206\u03b8 = 2\u03b4\u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/lmax or 1.08 \u00d7 104 /lmax arcmin. One arcminute (fwhm)\ncorresponds to baselines of 7.9 km and 73 km at redshifts of 10 and 100 respectively. For our calculation we will concentrate\nonly on an SKA-like array with Dtel = 6 km and a redshift range out to z = 13 since the smaller planned telescopes will not\nbe capable of mapping mass at high fidelity.\nThe fluctuations in the brightness temperature depends on the spin temperature, the ionization and the density of HI\nthrough\n\u03b4Tb \u2243 24(1 + \u03b4b )xH\n\n\u0010\n\nTs \u2212 TCMB\nTs\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n\u03a9b h2\n0.02\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\n0.15 1 + z\n\u03a9m h2 10\n\n\u00111/2\n\nmK\n\n(68)\n\n(Field 1959; Madau, Meiksin & Rees 1997). As is commonly done, we will assume that the spin temperature is much greater\nthan the CMB temperature. This leaves fluctuations in the ionization fraction, xH , and the baryon density \u03b4b = (\u03c1b \u2212 \u03c1b )/\u03c1b\nas the sources of fluctuations. We will make the simplifying assumption that xH = 1 until the universe is very rapidly and\nuniformly reionized. Realistically, the reionization process will be inhomogeneous and may extend over a significant redshift\nrange. This will increase C l (\u03bd) by perhaps a factor of 10 on scales larger the characteristic size of the ionized bubbles\nand thus might be expected to reduce the noise in \u03ba\u0303 significantly. However, we have derived the noise in the lensing map\nby approximating the fourth order statistics of \u03b4Tb as they would be for a Gaussian random field. If this is still a good\napproximation the lensing noise will be reduced. This is uncertain, however, since during reionization the field will clearly not\nbe Gaussian, especially when the neutral fraction is low. A definitive resolution of these uncertainties will not be available\n\n6\n7\n8\n\nttp://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/arrays/mwa/\nwww.lofar.org\nwww.skatelescope.org/\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\n\nFigure 11. The signal-to-noise, \u03c3\u03ba\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398, \u2206\u03bd)/\u03c3\u03ba (\u03b4\u0398), ratio for an SKA-like observation as a function of bandwidth and patch size. In\nall cases the contours are 1, 2, 4 and 8\u03c3 (when visible). The solid contours are for a covering fraction of fcover = 0.025 and the dashed\ncontours are for fcover = 0.018. The dotted contours are the signal-to-noise ratio for brightness temperature with the same telescope\nparameters and fcover = 0.018. The other telescope parameters are Tsys = 200 K, Dtel = 6 km, to = 90 days and the universe is assumed\nto be neutral in the redshift range z = 7 to 13 in all cases.\n\nuntil the observations are done. Here we model fluctuations in the baryons in the same way as in section 3.2 with linear\nstructure formation and redshift distortions.\nFigure 11 shows the signal-to-noise ratio, defined as \u03c3\u03ba\u0303 (\u03b4\u0398, \u2206\u03bd)/\u03c3\u03ba (\u03b4\u0398), for our SKA-like telescope. For the assumptions\ntaken here the telescope should be able to make images (2\u03c3) of the dark matter on 1.3 to 2.5 arcmin scales in 90 days\n(fcover = 0.018 to 0.025). These values are not too far from the optimal values and increasing the telescope's covering fraction\nor resolution would markedly improve upon these.\nUnlike in the irreducible noise only case shown in figure 6, when thermal noise is added the noise in \u03ba\u0303 does not go\nto an asymptotic value at small \u03b4\u0398. This is because the noise increases very rapidly near the maximum resolution of the\n>\ntelescope because of a combination of effects. First the intrinsic temperature power spectrum goes down at l \u223c\n1000. C l (\u03bd)\nis also suppressed by a factor of \u223c 1/\u2206\u03bd when l > D(z)/\u03b4r where \u03b4r is physical width corresponding to the bandwidth. In\naddition, for a fixed baseline the highest resolution is attained for only a limited range of frequency which limits the number\nof redshift bins. With the parameters adopted, the cross-correlation in the temperature between frequency channels never\nbecomes important because the noise generally dominates when \u2206\u03bd is small and it is assumed to have no cross-correlation\nbetween channels.\nAs can be seen from figure 11, there is an optimal bandwidth for measuring lensing. This comes about because at large\nbandwidths the number of independent frequency bins is limited. At small bandwidth the the signal-to-noise goes down\nbecause ClN goes up faster than C l with decreasing \u2206\u03bd for scales l < D(z)/\u03b4r. This optimal bandwidth is \u223c 0.05 MHz for\nour examples. If there is more structure on smaller scales, such as when there are ionized bubbles, the optimal frequency will\ndecrease.\nThe optimal bandwidth for lensing is generally smaller than the optimal bandwidth for measuring the brightness temperature itself as can also be seen in figure 11. At the optimal bandwidth the lensing map can have good fidelity while the\ntemperature map is noise dominated on the same scale. This is a somewhat counter-intuitive situation which reflects the fact\nthat it is better to get more independent redshift slices at low signal-to-noise than to image the temperature in fewer channels.\nWith a wider bandwidth the temperature can be imaged on the same angular scale as the mass distribution. This indicates\nthat it may be advantageous to use several bandwidths simultaneously.\nThere are many additional challenges to observing 21 cm radiation from high redshift. The galactic foreground from\nsynchrotron emission is about four orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal at \u223c 180 MHz and goes up with\ndecreasing frequency as \u03bd \u22122.6 . Both this emission and extragalactic foreground sources can, however, be cleaned from the\ndata because they are much smoother in frequency space (and also in position on the sky for the Galactic foreground) than\nthe 21 cm signal itself. At large frequency separations foreground emission may also decorrelate. Generally, foregrounds pose\nno more of a problem for mass-mapping than for direct mapping of the 21 cm itself. Rapid increases in foreground emission\n\n19\n\n\f20\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nand in the refractive index of the ionosphere with decreasing frequency make observations at higher redshift progressively\n>\nmore difficult. The high-redshift 21 cm absorption (z \u223c\n30) will be very difficult to observe and there are no mature plans to\n>\ndo so at this time. The ionosphere is opaque below \u223c 10 MHz or z \u223c\n150, so in principle all lower redshifts are accessible from\nthe ground. In practice, the high, time-dependent index of refraction will make it difficult to go beyond \u223c 60 MHz without\nmajor advances in telescope technology. The ultimate high redshift 21 cm telescope would be located on the far side of the\nMoon where the absence of terrestrial interference or an ionosphere would allow access to higher redshifts. However, the large\ncollecting area required would make this both technically challenging and expensive.\nMuch will depend on future instrument design and the as yet unknown characteristics of the 21 cm absorption/emission,\nparticularly around the epoch of reionization. Despite this, the planned specifications for SKA may enable it to make highfidelity maps of the matter distribution and if enough area can be surveyed very good statistical information should be\naccessible. Realistic upgrades to the collecting area and array size would greatly improve its ability to make mass maps.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that when low-frequency radio telescopes become sufficiently powerful to map the signal from high-redshift\n21 cm emission/absorption within a bandwidth of \u223c 0.05 MHz, the data will necessarily be good enough to map the gravitational shear due to foreground matter. Increasing the resolution of the telescope reduces the intrinsic noise in the shear\nmap both because of the number of statistically independent redshift slices increases and because the number of independent\npatches on the sky increases. As a result, 21 cm lensing offers the potential of producing high resolution, high signal-to-noise\nimages of the cosmic mass distribution. Such images would be of enormous value for the study of cosmology and galaxy\nformation.\nFor the specific problem of estimating cosmological parameters the requirements on resolution and redshift range are not\nparticularly demanding, but survey area is of great importance. Even for a full-sky survey with a pixel of radius \u03b4\u03b8 = 1 arcmin\n(2 arcmin fwhm) and 10% noise per pixel, the shear power spectrum would be cosmic variance dominated up to l \u223c 103 .\nThe cosmic variance limit is probably achievable up to l \u223c 104 with an array of \u223c 5 km in diameter and a covering factor\nof several percent. Cross-correlating several redshift slices with each other and with galaxy lensing surveys over a significant\nportion of the sky would begin a new era of very high precision cosmology.\nThe study of structure formation would benefit particularly from higher resolution observations, however. If a resolution\nof \u223c 6 arcsec (fwhm) could be achieved, every halo more massive than the Milky Way's would be clearly visible back to z \u223c 10.\n>\nEven with a resolution of \u223c 1 arcmin (fwhm) all the halos \u223c\n2 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 should be individually detected. Connecting these\nmass maps to images of emission at other wavelengths would provide a tremendous wealth of information about the evolution\nof structure and the formation of galaxies.\nRBM would like to thank B.

The flat sky approximation\ngreatly simplifies the mathematics and is well justified for the angular scales of interest here. A radio interferometer measures\nthe visibility, V (u), which in our case is related to the spin temperature by\nV (u)\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nd\u03b8 A(\u03b8)T ((\u03b8)ei2\u03c0u*\u03b8\n\n(A1)\n\nd2 w\u00c3(w)T\u0303 (u \u2212 w)\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere A(\u03b8) is the primary beam of the telescopes which is typically normalized to one at its peak (\u03b8 = 0) which gives its\nFourier transform, \u00c3(u), a normalization of one in u-space. Units of temperature are used here (flux density units have a\nfactor of 2kB /\u03bb2 ). Tildes signify Fourier transforms. The size of the primary beam dictates the area covered on the sky in one\n\"pointing\" of the telescopes. The separation of the antennas and the position on the sky dictate u.\nThe correlation in the visibilities is given by\nV\nCij\n\n\u2261\n=\n\u2243\n\nhV \u2217 (ui )V (uj )i\n\nZ\n\n(A3)\n\nd2 w \u00c3\u2217 (ui \u2212 w)\u00c3(uj \u2212 w)S(w) + \u03b4ij CuN\n\nS(ui )Wij + \u03b4ij CuN\n\n(A4)\n(A5)\n\nwhere S(u) is the intrinsic (cross-)power spectrum of the temperature and CuN is the noise. It has been assumed that the\ntemperature field is isotropic. Equation (A5) defines the window, Wij (w), that makes the visibilities correlated. This in effect\ndefines the resolution in u-space. Correlations will only exist when \u2206u \u2261 |ui \u2212 uj | is less than twice the width of \u00c3(u), i.e. the\nsmaller the telescopes are the narrower \u00c3(u) will be and the higher the resolution. This width will be denoted \u03c3u (u). It has\nbeen assumed in equation (A5) that the intrinsic power spectrum does not change very much on the scale of \u03c3u . The coordinate\nu is conjugate to the angle on the sky \u03b8 so the resolution is linked to the area covered on the sky by fsky \u2243 (2\u03c0\u03c3u )\u22122 .\nThe visibility power spectrum can be related to the spherical harmonic power spectrum through\nu X\n2\nu S(u) =\n(2l + 1)Cl J2l+1 (4\u03c0u)\n(A6)\n2\u03c0\nl\n\n\u2243\n\nl(1 + l)\nCl\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(A7)\nl=2\u03c0u\n\n>\nwhere the second approximation is very good for l \u223c\n60 (White et al. 1999). If there were just one visibility measured the\nFisher matrix would be\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(A8)\nF(u)ab = tr (CuV )\u22121 CuV ,a (CuV )\u22121 CuV ,b\n2\n\n(see Tegmark, Taylor & Heavens 1997, for a review of likelihood methods in astronomy). Visibilities within \u223c \u03c3u of each\n\n21\n\n\fMetcalf & White\n\n22\n\nother will be correlated, but an estimate of the total Fisher matrix can be made by assuming one measurement per correlated\nregion which gives\nFab\n\n=\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nF(u)ab \u2243\n\nu\n\n\u2243\n\u2243\n\nd2 u\nF(u)ab\n\u03c3u2\n\n(A9)\n\nX\n1\nF(l = 2\u03c0|u|)ab\n(2\u03c0\u03c3u )2\n\n(A10)\n\nlm\n\nfsky\n\nX\n\n(2l + 1)F(l = 2\u03c0u)ab .\n\n(A11)\n\nl\n\nThis is the formula (62) in section 5 used to calculate cosmological parameter constraints. It can be seen that the fsky\nfactor comes from the correlations or resolution in visibility space. A more sophisticated treatment would allow for partially\ncorrelated visibilities within \u03c3u of each other which would reduce the noise further. The Fisher matrix is an\n\u0001 estimate of the\nexpected inverse correlation matrix in the model parameters at the maximum likelihood solution. Thus F\u22121 aa is an estimate\nof the error in the parameter a after marginalizing over the other parameters. This formalism as outlined here in terms of the\ntemperature, but it is equally valid for the lensing shear or convergence.\nThe size of individual antennas in future radio telescope arrays are expected to be of order a few wavelengths or smaller\nas in the case of dipole antennas. In this case the primary beam covers almost the whole hemisphere. However, subtracting\ninterference and handling the huge data rate will probably require synthesizing a much smaller beam. In addition, the\nsubtraction of galactic foregrounds will probably not be possible in some regions near the galactic plane. For these reasons\nthe sky fraction, fsky , and the shape of the observed fields will be limited for a single pointing of the telescope beam. The sky\nfraction and thus the l-space resolution can be increased with multiple pointing or mosaicking.\n\nAPPENDIX B: LENSING IN FOURIER SPACE\nThe temperature on the sky is to first order\n~\n~ (\u03b8, \u03bd)\nT (\u03b8, \u03bd) = T (\u03b8, \u03bd) + \u2207\u03a6(\u03b8)\n* \u2207T\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere T (\u03b8, \u03bd) is the temperature before lensing and \u03a6(L) is the lensing potential defined so that the deflection angle is\n~\n\u03b1(\u03b8) = \u2207\u03a6(\u03b8).\nThe Fourier transform of this is\nT (l, \u03bd) = T (l, \u03bd) \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u2032 \u2032\nl * (l \u2212 l\u2032 )\u03a6(l\u2032 )T (l \u2212 l\u2032 , \u03bd)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(B2)\n\nand, as a result, to first order\nT (l, \u03bd)T \u2217 (l \u2212 L, \u03bd \u2032 ) = L * l Cl (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) + L * (L \u2212 l) C|l\u2212L| (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) \u03a6(L)\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere L 6= 0 and the average is over realizations of the temperature field while keeping the lensing potential fixed (Hu &\nOkamoto 2002). Note that if the noise is homogeneous it will drop out of this equation and the Cl 's will be only the power\nspectrum of the fluctuations in brightness temperature.\nThe observed temperature is always binned into frequency channels or bands and smoothed by the telescope's beam.\nThis observed temperature is\nT (l, \u03bd)\n\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndr q\u03bd (r , \u2206\u03bd)\n\n1\nD(\u03bd)2\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u2032 \u00c3(l\u2032 \u2212 l)T (l\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 )\n\nd2 l\u2032 \u00c3(l\u2032 \u2212 l)\n\nZ\n\ndk\nT21\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nl\u2032\n,k\nD(\u03bd)\n\n(B4)\n\n\u0013\n\nq\u0303\u03bd (k, \u03bd)\n\n(B5)\n\nwhere the q\u03bd (r \u2032 , \u2206\u03bd) is the response function for the band centered on \u03bd, T21 is the 3D Fourier transform of the brightness\ntemperature and\nq\u0303\u03bd (k, \u03bd)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2243\n\njo\n\ndr \u2032 q\u03bd (r \u2032 , \u2206\u03bd)eikr\n\n\u0012\n\nk\u03b4r(\u03bd, \u2206\u03bd)\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2032\n\n(B6)\n\neikr(\u03bd)\n\n(B7)\n\nwith\n\u03b4r(\u03bd, \u2206\u03bd) =\n\n2\n\u221a\nHo \u03a9m \u03bdo\n\n\u0010p\n\n\u03bd + \u2206\u03bd/2 \u2212\n\np\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03bd \u2212 \u2206\u03bd/2 .\n\n(B8)\n\n\fHigh-resolution imaging of the cosmic mass distribution from gravitational lensing of pregalactic HI\nIn (B7) the response function is taken to be a boxcar shape with sharp edges at \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd/2 and \u03bd \u2212 \u2206\u03bd/2. In (B8) the fact\nthat the universe is matter dominated at the time of the 21 cm emission/absorption is used to express the radial distances in\nterms of frequency.\nAs a result of beam smearing relation (B3) will become\n\u2217\n\n\u2032\n\nT (l, \u03bd)T (l \u2212 L, \u03bd ) = (2\u03c0)\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u2032\u2032 \u03a6(l\u2032\u2032 )\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u2032 \u00c3(l\u2032 )\u00c3\u2217 (l\u2032 + L)C l+l\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd2 l\u2032 \u00c3(l\u2032 )\u00c3\u2217 (l\u2032 \u2212 l\u2032\u2032 + L)\n\nZ\n\ndk P21\n\n\b\n\nl\u2032\u2032 * (l + l\u2032 )C l+l\u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) \u2212 l\u2032\u2032 * (l + l\u2032 \u2212 l\u2032\u2032 )C l+l\u2032 \u2212l\u2032\u2032 (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )\n\nwhere the correlations between temperature modes before lensing and beam smearing\nC l (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )\n\n1\nD(\u03bd)2\n\n=\n\n\u0012r\n\n\u0013\n\nl2\n+ k2 , z(\u03bd) q\u0303\u03bd (k, \u03bd)q\u0303\u03bd\u2217 (k, \u03bd \u2032 )\nD(\u03bd)2\n\n(B9)\n\n\u0001\n\n(B10)\n\n(B11)\n\nIt is assumed that D(\u03bd) does not change significantly between frequencies that are significantly correlated. A more rigorous\nderivation of (B11) is in spherical harmonic space as has been done by Zaldarriaga et al. (2004), but for the scales of important\nhere the difference is very small and (B11) is considerably easier to evaluate.\nThere are two effects that make (B9) and (B10) different from the Hu & Okamoto (2002) result (B3). The first term (B9)\nrepresents an aliasing effect caused by the finite size of the beam. This will cause a false signal on scales approaching the size\n<\nof the beam or surveyed region, L \u223c\n2\u03c0\u03c3u , that will need to be subtracted. The second term (B10) is a kind of smoothing of\nthe lensing potential over a scale of \u223c 2\u03c0\u03c3u . In the limit of a very narrow beam, a large area in angle, the relation (B3) is\nrecovered except with the frequency binned power spectra. Thus the observations will really measure a lensing potential that\nis smoothed in Fourier-space in a rather complicated fashion.\n\nAPPENDIX C: CONVERGENCE ESTIMATORS\nIn the main text of this paper we used a real-space estimators for the shear and convergence, \u03b3\u0302i (\u03b8). We consider this the most\nintuitive and instructive approach. In the weak lensing limit the shear map can be converted to a convergence map because\nthey are both related to a single lensing potential by differential operators. This is commonly done for galaxy lensing surveys\n(see Bartelmann & Schneider (2001) for a review). The most straightforward method is to Fourier transform the shear map,\nmultiply by l dependent factors and then transform back to a convergence map (Kaiser & Squires 1993). Averaging this with\nthe \u03b3\u03023 map would produce a convergence map with less noise than the \u03b3\u03023 map alone. However, the gain in noise will not be\nas great as in the galaxy lensing case because in the 21 cm lensing case the Fourier modes of \u03b3\u03021 and \u03b3\u03022 are correlated unlike\nin the galaxy case. Probably a more practical approach from a technical point of view is to go directly from visibility space\nto a convergence map in real-space.\nMany convergence estimators in visibility or Fourier space are possible. Our real-space estimators can be Fourier transformed to make a set of estimators for the Fourier modes of shear and convergence, but the Fourier estimator of Hu & Okamoto\n(2002) has the advantage of having the lowest noise level for one frequency bin if the temperature distribution is Gaussian\nand the beam is infinitely large (in angle). Zahn & Zaldarriaga (2006) find an estimator in both angular Fourier-space and\nfrequency Fourier-space which is optimal with the added assumption that the frequency Fourier modes are statistically independent and Gaussian distributed. The statistical independence of the modes will break down because of binning in frequency\nand to a lesser extent because of the finite range in frequency. For this reason it is difficult to determine how bandwidth will\naffect the noise in their estimator. Instead we choose to use the Hu & Okamoto (2002) estimator for each frequency band and\nthen weight each band.\nWe consider a second-order estimator for the shear or convergence of the form\n\u03b3\u0303i (L)\n\n=\n\nXZ\n\u03bd\n\n\u2217\n\nd2 l \u0393i (l, L, \u03bd) T (l, \u03bd)T (l \u2212 L, \u03bd).\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere, as in the main text, \u03b3\u03031,2 are estimators for the two components of shear and \u03b3\u03033 is an estimator for the convergence. In\nthis case the estimators are of the form\n\u0393i (l, L, \u03bd) = Di (L)\u03c9(\u03bd, L)\u03c7(l, L, \u03bd)\n\n(C2)\n\nwhere\nDi (L) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\u0001\n\uf8f2 L21 \u2212 L22\n\uf8f3\n\n2L1 L2\n|L|2\n\n(C3)\n\n23\n\n\f24\n\nMetcalf & White\n\nThe function \u03c7(l, L, \u03bd) is proportional to the Hu & Okamoto (2002) estimator\n\u03c7(l, L, \u03bd) =\n\n\u0002\n\nL * l C l (\u03bd) + L * (L \u2212 l) C |l\u2212L| (\u03bd)\nT\n\nT\n\nC l (\u03bd)C |l\u2212L| (\u03bd)\n\n\u0003\n\n(C4)\n\nT\n\nT\n\nN\n\nwhere C l (\u03bd) is the power spectrum of the actual temperature while C l (\u03bd) = C l (\u03bd) + C l (\u03bd) is the observed power spectrum\nwhich includes noise and \u03c9(\u03bd, L) is a weight that is to be determined.\nIn the limit of an infinitely large beam the correlation between modes is\n\u03b3\u0302i (L) \u03b3\u0302j\u2217\n\n\u2032\n\nL\n\n\u0001\n\n4\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\n2(2\u03c0) \u03b4 L \u2212 L Di (L)Dj (L)\n\n=\n\nXX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c9(\u03bd)\u03c9(\u03bd )\n\n\u03bd\u2032\n\n\u03bd\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nT\n\nd2 l \u03c7 (l, L) \u03c7 (l, L) C l (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )C |l\u2212L| (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )\n\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03b4 L \u2212 L\u2032 Di (L)Dj (L)N\u03b3\u0302ij (L)\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\n(C5)\n(C6)\n\nIt has been assumed here that the temperature is Gaussian distributed so that the fourth moment can be written as products\n<\nof second moments. The finite beam will cause correlations in the noise h\u03b3i (L)\u03b3i (L+\u03b4L)i =\n6 0 when \u03b4L \u223c\n2\u03c0\u03c3u . The expression\nfor these correlations is lengthy, but easily worked out. In general there will be a correlation between the modes for different\ncomponents of shear, unlike in real-space. An image can be constructed by Fourier transforming (C1) to real-space with a\nsmoothing window. The noise at a point on this image will be\n\u03c3i2 (\u03b4\u0398) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 L\n2\nW\u0303 (L, \u03b4\u0398) Di (L)2 N\u03b3\u0302 (L)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(C7)\n\nwhere W\u0303 (L, \u03b4\u0398) is the Fourier transform of the smoothing function. This implies that \u03c3\u03ba2 (\u03b4\u0398) = 2\u03c312 (\u03b4\u0398) = 2\u03c322 (\u03b4\u0398) in\ncontrast to the noise in the real-space estimators.\nAs in the real-space version, the optimal frequency weights, \u03c9(\u03bd), are complicated in general, but they simplify if we\nmake the approximation that each frequency bin is statistically independent.

If the frequency bins\nare uncorrelated N\u03bdeff (L) = N\u03bd and \u2206\u03bdL = \u2206\u03bd, but if there are correlations between bins N\u03bdeff (L) < N\u03bd and \u2206\u03bdL > \u2206\u03bd. The\nT\nirreducible noise limit discussed in section 3 corresponds to the case where C l (\u03bd) = C l (\u03bd) and to infinitely narrow frequency\nbins.\nIn actual data the temperature distribution will not be Gaussian, the foregrounds will not be perfectly subtracted which\nwill produce spurious correlations in frequency, there will be holes in the surveyed area caused by point source subtraction,\nthere will be a finite and irregular beam, and the coverage of u-v plane will not be complete. All these complications making\nit unclear at this time what estimator will be the best choice for real data.\n\n\f"}
