These results support\nthe accepted explanation for the origin of the intracluster stars.\nIn an ongoing, second stage of the simulation, which extends the isolated cluster\nresults to a cosmologically significant region of the Universe, the author similarly assists in the implementation of a particle-particle/particle-mesh simulation and the joint\nanalysis of the results to-date.

Thanks to everyone in my family, to be\nsure, for their patience, but within the university, I thank particularly Laurent Drissen\nfor encouraging me to proceed towards the master's degree when he did - surprising\nwhat a word at the right time can do! Thanks to Serge Pineault for his understanding\nand encouragement along the way, especially when I had recently returned to the study\nof science. Thanks to other graduate students, such as Simon Cantin, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\nRobitaille, and V\u00e9ronique Petit, for answering my many questions, sometimes repeatedly! Thanks to my friend Andrea Clark for copy editing so many mistakes out of this\ntext - at such short notice! Thanks last (certainly not least!) to Paramita Barai and\nmy Director Hugo Martel for their guidance, patience, and understanding throughout\nmy time studying with them. While the above individuals (and many others) have\nhelped a great deal, any error surviving to the printing stage is exclusively my own.\n\n\fTo my mom, Wilma Webster, and my dad, Urbano\nBrito, who always encourage me to continue learning;\nto uncle Jim Webster, and to my siblings Cendy, Moy,\nand Steven who are also ever in my heart and mind.\n\n\fvi\n\nRelease me for a little while\nAnd let me go\nOut in the twilight\nWhere over red fires of sunset\nThe thin moon gleams\nThere let me pass\nLet mortal shadows drop away\nAnd leave the spinning earth\nBehind me\nIn the weightlessness of outer space\nI would adventure\nTowards far galaxies\n--Andromeda Webster\nFlashes from space.\n\nLo!

With the advent of more powerful telescopy\nthe existence of IC stars became clear (Fig. 1.1) and the question became \"Where do\nthese stars originate?\" These stars could be part of cluster-member galaxies; they could\nhave formed in-situ; or they could have been stripped from member galaxies by various\nprocesses. Dwarf galaxies (DGs) are the most numerous galaxies; they are low mass\n(107 \u2013 109 M ) galaxies having an absolute magnitude fainter than MB \u2248 \u221216 to \u221218\nmag (Grebel 2001; Bothun et al. 1991). Contemporary opinion ascribes the origin of IC\nstars to, for example, the tidal destruction of DGs during the evolution of the cluster.\nClusters are large groups containing up to thousands of galaxies. DGs can be destroyed\nin various ways during the evolution of the cluster. Understanding the nature of IC\nlight is important as, for example, reproduction of the observed proportions (and other\nrelated parameters) of IC light can be used to refine cosmological models. The goal of\nthis research project is to compare the various modes of dwarf galaxy destruction and\nascertain if dwarf galaxy destruction by tides is sufficient to explain the observed IC\nlight.\nAs part of a team I have simulated and examined the relationships between six\npossible outcomes of dwarf galaxy destruction during the evolution of isolated clusters.\nSubsequently, with this team, I have analyzed the results to date of an extension of\nthe isolated cluster results to a cosmologically significant region of the Universe. The\nanalysis, and the simulations I carried out as member of the team in this project use\nknown parameters such as the luminosity function (LF), various cluster halo mass\nprofiles, and the cosmological parameters to simulate, test, and corroborate the method\nused and the results obtained.\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.1 Trails of gas in a nearby cluster.

Introduction\n\n3\n\nTypical simulations exploring the evolution of clusters devote much time and processing power to a single simulation. Shifting attention from sheer processing power to\nclever programming, however, can allow for statistical exploration of the relationships,\nin a significant region of the Universe, between different modes of DG destruction in\nclusters. DG destruction has been widely touted as an explanation for the observed IC\nlight, which contributes up to 25% to cluster luminosities. The destruction of DGs (by\ntides) would produce IC stars in the IC medium; it is these stars that are the purported\nsource of the observed IC light.\nHeuristic modeling of the DG interactions allows prediction of the average DG behavior with an economy of time and processing power. Rather than unnecessarily flex\nprocessing power \"muscles\", subgrid physics are implemented in this project and a small\nnumber of particles (\u223c 1 000) is used to represent a typical cluster. Results are consistent with accepted theories of the IC light being largely produced by tidal disruption\nof DGs.\nAlternative theories as to the origin of the IC stars include for example, in situ\nformation, with the notion that the IC stars originate at least partly from DGs that\nhave had the outermost material stripped by a process known as 'galaxy harassment'\n(Richstone 1976; Moore 1998), or another phenomenon termed tidal stirring, where\ntidal shocks strip the DGs (Mayer et al. 2001).\nIn this research project six possible outcomes are identified from interaction between\na dwarf galaxy and the rest of the cluster: (1) The galaxy merges with another; (2) The\ngalaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of a larger galaxy, but the fragments accrete to that\nlarger galaxy; (3) The galaxy is destroyed by tides of a larger galaxy, and the fragments\nare dispersed in the IC medium; (4) The galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of the\nbackground halo; (5) The galaxy survives to the present (i.e. it is not destroyed by any\nprocess); and (6) The galaxy is ejected from the cluster. By analyzing these interactions\nit is shown that the average behavior of DGs is consistent with the destruction of DGs\nas an explanation for the origin of IC stars when one takes into account the various\nresults of interaction. That is, IC stars come from a variety of origins, which for the\nmost part arise from DG interactions in the cluster.\nThe results from this part of the project, obtained from simulations of a single\nidealized cluster are extended in a second, ongoing half of the project that simulates a\ncosmologically significant volume of space, i.e. a volume containing numerous clusters.\nStudy of the IC light is timely, as recent discoveries of IC stars in the Virgo cluster\nmight result in an opportunity to learn about details of cluster origins (Arnaboldi 2004).\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n4\n\nAdditionally, understanding properties of clusters, such as the luminosity function,\nnumber density function, and formation epoch is worthwhile as these are important\ntools in testing cosmological models and parameters.\n\n1.1\n\nDwarf galaxies\n\nGalaxies in general can be thought of as the building blocks of the Universe; DGs can\nbe thought of as the fundamental units of mass. DGs are the galaxies that have the\nlargest dark matter (DM) component (Bothun et al. 1991) and they are the most\nnumerous. Nonetheless, most studies conclude the DG contribution to the total mass\ndensity is smaller than that of giant galaxies, stemming from the untested assumption\nthat the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of galaxies does not increase for smaller and smaller\ngalaxies (Bothun et al. 1991). The simulations presented here include only gravity, with\nno other physical process (gas and DM behave the same way under gravity). When\nnecessary, the IC light is calculated using a M/L.\nDGs, defined in the previous section as low mass (107 \u2013 109 M ) galaxies having an\nabsolute magnitude fainter than MB \u2248 \u221216 or \u221218 mag, have low surface brightness and\nlow metallicity (Grebel 2001). In the simulations presented herein, as in the observed\nUniverse, DGs are the most numerous galaxies occurring. DGs are thought to comprise\napproximately 80% of the Local Volume galaxy population (D \u2264 10 Mpc), and may\nhave a space density \u223c 40 times that of bright galaxies in the Universe (StaveleySmith et al. 1992). There exists, however, a deficiency in the number of observed low\nluminosity DGs (discrepancy more than one order of magnitude) as compared with the\nlarge number of theoretically predicted low mass DM haloes (Trentham & Hodgkin\n2002; Trentham et al. 2006). This is recognized as a problem for cold DM theory; the\nlikely solution involves energy feedback from stellar evolution.\nDGs belong typically to one of three main morphological types: (1) dwarf irregulars\n(dIrr), (2) dwarf spheroidals (dSph), and (3) dwarf ellipticals (dE). These types of\ngalaxies have similar scaling, but some dwarf irregulars have bluer colors and more\ndisturbed morphologies; they are called blue compact dwarfs. There exist other, rare\ngalaxies that do not fit into this classification, such as huge low surface brightness giants\nlike Malin 1 (Trentham 1998).\nThere is evidence that dEs are further subdivided into two classes, compact ones\nand diffuse ones. The only compact dE in the Local Group is M32, which lies very\nclose to the Milky Way's giant companion, M31. Compact dE galaxies that are not\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n5\n\nclose companions of any giant galaxy have been found in nearby galaxy clusters. The\nradial surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are reasonably well fitted by a R1/4\nlaw, corresponding to their elliptical nature; this is called the de Vaucouleurs law,\nas per Binney & Merrifield (1998), hereafter BM98. By contrast, the radial surfacebrightness profiles of the other class of dE galaxies, the diffuse ones, are best fitted by\nan exponential e\u2212R/Rd ,\nBothun et al. (1991) mention that there are at least two other profile types. One is\nthat some dwarfs have very flat cores and then steep fall-offs; in general these objects\nare at the faint end of the distribution in central surface brightness, and consequently\nthey are the most difficult to discover. Another is that some compact dwarfs have\npower-law surface brightness profiles. If sufficiently faint or small, these galaxies are\ndifficult to distinguish from star clusters.\nThe DGs in the simulations of this project are assumed to be spherical (an idealization). When calculating galaxy-pair interactions, however, a galaxy is herein considered\na bound virialized system with an internal kinetic energy and a potential energy. These\nenergies are included in the total energy of the interacting pair of galaxies (Barai et al.\n2009).\n\n1.2\n\nDark matter\n\nThe as-of-yet unobserved dark matter (DM) is a pressureless fluid thought to be responsible for the growth of cosmological perturbations through gravitational instability; it\nis expected to be more abundant in extensive haloes that stretch to 100 \u2013 200 kpc from\nthe center of galaxies (Vergados 2006).\nThe single systems with the largest proportion of DM are believed to be faint DGs.\nDGs in general have a correspondingly high ratio of dark-to-luminous mass, with M/L\nas high as that of galaxy groups and poor clusters. DGs are increasingly DM-dominated\nat fainter magnitudes. Among the faintest dwarfs in the Local Group are DGs such as\nDraco and Ursa Minor with M/L \u2248 100 within their core-fitting radii and total M/L\nthat are probably much larger than this (Trentham 1998)1 .\nIt is thought today that of the total matter in the Universe, an overwhelming 95%\nof the mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters is made of an unknown DM component,\n1\n\nThe high DM content of these faint DGs suggests a link between their mass functions and the\npower spectrum of primordial fluctuations of small scales (Trentham & Tully 2002).\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n6\n\nthe vast majority of which is non-relativistic (cold). Evidence for the existence of\nDM comes from measurements of the rotation curves of galaxies, measurements of\ngravitational lensing and from the existence of hot gas in clusters (Freese 2006) as\nwell as from methods of estimating cluster masses on the basis of the temperature\nof IC gas (Rosati et al. 2002). Evidence also comes from measurements including\ncosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations, redshift surveys, gravitationallensing shear effects, and distribution of absorbing neutral clouds along different lines\nof sight (Pryor 1996). The concordance cosmological model, \u039bCDM (where \u039b is the\ncosmological constant and CDM stands for cold DM), is the simplest model resulting\nin an interpretation consistent with the observed Universe. Figure 1.2 shows the results\nof various simulations of which the \u039bCDM model produces voids and filaments closer\nto observations of the actual Universe.\nThe total density parameter is \u03a90 = 0.27. Baryons account for \u03a9b = 0.04. Hence,\nthe non-baryonic (exotic) part accounts for 0.23/0.27 = 85% of the mass in the Universe,\nand this component is what is normally referred to as DM. Notice, however that some\nof the baryonic matter is unobserved. This component is called baryonic DM. The\nmost likely candidates for dark baryons are known as massive compact halo objects\n(MACHOs), which include faint stars or stellar remnants. The best current limit on\nthe MACHO abundance is 20% of the dark halo mass. Interestingly, the appearance of\nbaryons varies with scale, occurring mostly in stars below a galaxy mass scale of M \u2217 (M \u2217\nis the mass of the Galaxy, the Milky Way) and mostly in hot gas for systems much more\nmassive than M \u2217 (i.e. galaxy groups and clusters), while for DM there is no difference\nin properties between galaxy, group, and cluster scales (Silk 2007). Further progress on\nDM structure will come as progress is made in understanding when and how galaxies\nformed (Silk 2007). Currently, it is thought that a realistic distribution of DM haloes\nmight be produced by models including a process involving feedback augmented by, for\nexample, hyper novae (a very energetic supernova thought to result from an extreme\ncore-collapse scenario), or a top-heavy initial mass function (the mass dependence of\nthe number of stars that form per mass interval per unit volume). Models resulting\nin such realistic distributions can involve for example incorporating star and active\ngalactic-nuclei (AGN) feedback; using massive gas outflows can effectively weaken the\nDM gravity in the central cusp of the dense baryonic core, which forms by gas dissipation\n(Silk 2007).\nThe presented simulations assume an isotropic distribution of the galaxies inside the\ncluster; this is an idealization, but little is yet known of the internal structure of the\nDM as explained in the foregoing. Furthermore, the positions of the galaxies herein are\nchosen using realistic guidelines consistent with the literature.\n\n\fChapter 1.

The standard model (SCDM) does not assume a cosmological constant. The tilted model (\u03c4 CDM)\ntakes into account possible pre-inflationary inhomogeneities.

Introduction\n\n1.3\n\n8\n\nLuminosity functions\n\nThe relative number of galaxies of various Hubble types is usually represented in terms\nof the luminosity function (LF) as shown in Figure 1.3. The galaxy LF is closely\nrelated to the galaxy mass function, one of the most important parameters in galaxy\nformation models (Trentham & Tully 2002). The LF (loosely based on the PressSchechter formalization for the primordial halo distribution) has for nearly 30 years\nbeen a standard tool for quantifying the galaxy population (Driver 2004) and is a useful\ndescription of the galaxy content of any particular environment as it is straightforward\nto measure (Trentham & Tully 2002). Recent studies consistently show that, with some\nexceptions, low surface brightness (LSB) is synonymous with low luminosity (Driver\n2004). Small stellar fraction and very low luminosities make DGs the hardest galaxies\nto detect. It is in fact generally problematic to quantify the low end of the LF as\nillustrated by the lack of points contained under the low luminosity area of the curve\nin Figure 1.4 .\nThe LF can be defined as the number density of galaxies per unit luminosity (Trentham & Tully 2002). A functional form of a general analytic fit to galactic LFs, as\nproposed by Schechter (1976), is:\n\u2217\n\n\u03a6(L) = (\u03a6\u2217 /L\u2217 )(L/L\u2217 )\u03b1 e\u2212L/L ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nor equivalently, in terms of absolute magnitude:\n\u2217 \u2212M)\n\n\u03a6(M) = (0.4ln10)\u03a6\u2217 100.4(\u03b1+1)(M\n\nexp[\u2212100.4(M\n\n\u2217 \u2212M)\n\n],\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and L\u2217 (or M\u2217 ) are free parameters used to obtain best possible fits to available\ndata (Carroll & Ostlie 1996). The normalization at the characteristic luminosity L\u2217 is\n\u03a6\u2217 ; it is used as such a free parameter in some descriptions of the LF. Subdividing\nthe morphological galaxy types finely, shows that different classes of galaxy have very\ndifferent LFs (BM98). The LF consistently provides a good formal fit to the observed\nluminosity distribution. This consistency between the luminosity distribution and the\nLF appears to hold regardless of environment. A value of \u03b1 = \u22121 implies equal numbers\nof galaxies in the magnitude intervals, a more negative (or steep) value implies that\ndwarf systems are more numerous (Driver 2004).\nTo explain the shape of the LF in a cold DM Universe, it is necessary to include\nat least a feedback mechanism (beyond the heating resulting from the photo-ionization\nof the pregalactic gas) to flatten the faint end of the LF and to suppress cooling at\nthe centers of the massive haloes of groups and clusters. Despite various mechanisms\nhaving been attempted, however, it is not a simple matter to replicate the shape; for\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n9\n\nFigure 1.3 The global luminosity function.

Image borrowed from Driver (2004).\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n11\n\nexample, to reproduce a sharp cutoff as observed at the bright end of the LF; Benson\net al. (2003).\nThe question concerning the LF at the faint end is an old problem noted by Zwicky\nin a private communication to Parolin et al. (2003): \"Where does it [the faint end of\nthe LF] end and what kind of objects populate it?\" This problem has become easier to\naddress with the high resolution imaging and spectra in modern times, and yet \"fainter\nthan MR = \u221216, the LF is only known in a handful of environments\" (Trentham &\nTully 2002).\nBarkhouse et al. (2002), analyze a very large sample of cluster galaxies with the\nsame purpose as Parolin et al. (2003) namely to examine the dependency of the faint\nend slope on cluster morphology as well as to examine the gradient, if any, in the\nfaint end as one moves towards the outskirts of a cluster. They do not go very deep\nin magnitude (MR < \u221216), but their results offer positive evidence. There has been\na suggestion that the faint-end slope of the galaxy LF may be steeper than previous\nstudies indicated. This suggestion arises from the existence of very faint DGs not being\nincluded, such as those having very flat cores and then steep fall-offs (therefore being\nvery hard to detect). Including these dwarfs would increase the faint-end slope beyond\n\u22121.5. Measurements of tidal radii and carbon star velocity dispersions in Local Group\ndwarf spheroidals indicate that the largest dynamical M/L belong to the least luminous\ngalaxies, thus the M/L of LSB DGs could be large. The M/L numbers in the local group\nrange from 5 \u2013 10 for Sculptor to 50 \u2013 100 for Ursa minor (Bothun et al. 1991).\nThere appears to be no clear sign of a lower limit to the LF of irregular galaxies.\nThey are, on average, much fainter than the other galaxy types. The numbers of\nirregulars grow as one moves to fainter magnitudes. Their faint nature can be crudely\ndescribed by a Schechter function (parameters MB \u2217 (Irr) = \u221215 + 5 log h and \u03b1(Irr) =\n\u22120.3, where 100 h is the Hubble constant). A fit to the dE galaxies can be given by a\nSchechter function (parameters MB \u2217 (dE) = \u221216 + 5 log h and \u03b1(dE) = \u22121.3). Dwarf\nellipticals show a LF that is open ended, similarly to the irregular galaxies (BM98). Note\nthat in our simulations the Hubble constant is given a value H0 = 73.2km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nconsistent with the results of WMAP3.\nAlthough the field and cluster LFs are broadly consistent (Fig. 1.5), upon comparing\nthe respective LFs for the local field of galaxies near the Milky Way and the Virgo\ncluster, it is clear that there is not a universal LF. Rather, each LF depends on the\nenvironment of the particular sample of galaxies (Fig. 1.6). Similarly observations\nsuggest that the galaxy type depends on the environment (Fig. 1.7). Astronomers may\nin the future have the alternative of using information from bivariate distributions as\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n12\n\nhighlighted by Driver (2004), who emphasizes that the global galaxy LF (red line in\nFig. 1.3) condenses the available information of galaxies (images in the Figure) into three\ncrucial numbers: 1) the characteristic luminosity M\u2217 ; 2) the absolute normalisation \u03a6\u2217 ;\nand 3) the faint-end slope \u03b1. Driver (2004) highlights in addition, that although the\nSchechter parameterization is usually a remarkably good fit, it may be that too much\nimportant information is lost, for instance the sizes and bulge-to-total parameters.\nIn their long term research, Parolin et al. (2003) have measured a set of clusters\nin various colors in order to better understand the shape of the LF in clusters and\nto pinpoint the slope of the faint end. Their analysis and data interpretation use\ndifferent algorithms to reduce or eliminate systematic error, robustly corroborating a\nbimodal nature to the cluster LF. They emphasize, however, that in their view, it is the\nestimate of the total luminosity in different optical color and its correlation with the\nX-ray luminosity that will give the opportunity, compared with the X-ray luminosity,\nto better pinpoint some of the characteristics of the cluster and IC medium evolution.\nWhile there is no universal LF, the luminosity function of cluster galaxies is nearly\nthe same from cluster to cluster (Fig. 1.5), generally following the form proposed by\nSchechter (1976). Observing the high luminosity tip of that distribution allows one to\nnormalize the overall galaxy LF for the cluster, yielding estimates for both the cluster's\ntotal optical luminosity and its mass. The number of galaxies in luminosity range dL,\n\u2217\nabout L, is proportional to L\u03b1 e\u2212L/L , with \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121 (Voit 2005). Carlberg et al. (1997)\nshowed that the radial mass density \u03c1(r) and the radial number density \u03bd(r) of galaxies\nare roughly proportional to each other; a finding that is used in this project to assign\na realistic galaxy distribution for galaxies in the isolated cluster.\nThe Schechter LF is used variously in this research project to guide the results. The\nLF is used, for instance, in combination with a Monte-Carlo rejection function to generate various initial conditions (i.e. the mass of the cluster halo and the mass of the DGs\ninside the halo). The first part of the simulation uses galaxy particles with distributions\nof masses and luminosities chosen to follow a Schechter luminosity distribution and an\naccepted M/L. The initial position of the galaxies (radial coordinate) is then paired to\na given galaxy avoiding overlap. Several series include a central giant cD galaxy. In\nthe second half of the project presented here, when the simulation has proceeded to an\nadvanced redshift, the mass distribution is plotted and the corresponding LF is compared with observed LFs; this comparison is then used to ensure the obtained results\nare realistic (Barai et al. 2009).\n\n\fChapter 1.

Because structure grows hierarchically, the growth and development of clusters directly traces the process of structure\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n16\n\nformation in the Universe. Clusters are dynamical systems not yet in equilibrium. Cluster galaxy velocity dispersion and the virial theorem thus cannot yield an exact mass\nmeasurement. Instead, other data (i.e. spatial distribution of galaxy velocities) must\nbe used to accurately measure the masses of nearby clusters (Voit 2005).\nFor distant clusters the data necessary to supplement the mass measurements are\nmore difficult to obtain. To fill this gap, simulations of cluster formation can be used for\ncalibrating the approximate virial relationship between velocity dispersion and cluster\nmass. Yet another of Zwicky's (1937) important contributions is his idea that cluster\nmasses could be measured through gravitational lensing of background galaxies. This\nis one of the primary contemporary methods for measuring cluster mass. The masses\nof clusters now are measured at roughly 1015 times that of the Sun's. This tremendous\nmass notwithstanding, all of the stars in all of a cluster's galaxies represent only a small\nfraction of a cluster's overall mass. The majority of the mass, in clusters as throughout\nthe Universe, is an unobserved component, DM. (It is the DM's gravity that caused\nthe baryons to gravitate together into the DM's deep potential wells, there to become\ngalaxies.) Clusters contain substantially more mass in the form of hot gas than in\nstars. This hot gas is observable with X-ray and microwave instruments. A cluster's\ntotal mass turns out to be about seven times the combined baryonic mass in stars and\nhot gas (Voit 2005).\nModels for the X-ray surface brightness of clusters are obtained using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation (variations include assumptions, i.e. spherical symmetry,\nand isothermality of the gas). Although clusters are dynamical systems that have not\nyet completely equilibrated, they appear to be in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium.\nThese models are viable because of the relationship between the gas temperature (obtained from the X-ray spectrum) and the depth of the cluster's potential well; the deep\npotential wells compress the gas, causing it to emit in the X-ray band (Voit 2005).\nAs per Voit (2005), under the assumption of spherical symmetry there is, as a\nfunction of the radius from the density center, a relation between the gas density \u03c1g\nand the temperature T:\n\nd ln \u03c1g d ln T\nT\u03c6 (r)\n+\n= \u22122\n.\nd ln r\nd ln r\nT\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe characteristic temperature T\u03c6 of a singular isothermal sphere with the same value\nof M(r)/r is given by:\n\u03bcmp\nkB T\u03c6 (r) = GM(r)\n,\n(1.4)\n2r\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n17\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, \u03bc is the mean molecular weight of the IC gas,\nand mp is the proton mass. The well-known \u03b2 models add the assumption that the gas\nis isothermal (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976; Voit 2005). Assuming an isothermal\nvelocity distribution and a constant velocity dispersion \u03c31D , gives:\nd ln \u03c1g\n\u03bcmp d\u03c6\nd ln \u03c1\n=\u2212\n=\u03b2\n,\ndr\nkT dr\ndr\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere \u03c1g is the gas density, and \u03c1 and T are generalized to the particles responsible for\nthe mass distribution. Further, as detailed in Voit (2005):\n2\n\u03b2 \u2261 \u03bcmp \u03c31D\n/kT.\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe observed surface brightness profiles of clusters is described quite well by the \u03b2\nmodels in a given radial range, but give the best fits for rich clusters and a possible trend\ntoward lower \u03b2 values in poorer clusters. Most of the observed X-rays must come from\na relatively small proportion of the IC medium (as the X-ray luminosity integrated over\nradius converges for \u03b2 > 0.5; Voit 2005). The \u03b2 models can underestimate the central\nsurface brightness within the core radius rc and overestimate the brightness at s \u001d rc\n(Vikhlinin et al. 1999). This is in part because of the assumption of isothermality of\nthe IC medium (an idealization), and in part because real cluster potentials differ from\nthe King model (Voit 2005).\nThere is a generic form for representing density profiles shallower than isothermal at\nsmall radii and steeper than isothermal at large radii, as corresponding to DM haloes;\nthis is:\n(1.7)\n\u03c1M (r) \u221d r\u2212p (r + rs )p\u2212q ,\nwhere p and q describe inner and outer power-law slopes, correspondingly, and the\nradius rs marks the steepening of the profile (Voit 2005). Some models for the X-ray\nsurface brightness include the \u03b2 model, the King model (\u03b2 = 1) (Molinari et al. 1998),\nand the Navarro, Frenk & White model (Navarro et al. 1997), hereafter NFW, as well\nas the Hernquist model (Nipoti et al. 2004).\nThe \u03b2 model is given by:\nh\n\n\u03c1gas (r) = \u03c10 1 + (r/rc )2\n\ni\u22123\u03b2/2\n,\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the central density. The values of \u03c10 , rc and \u03b2 are taken from Piffaretti &\nKaastra (2006a), who give the gas density parameters for 16 nearby clusters. Scaling\nthe gas density with the universal ratio of matter (dark + baryonic) to baryons gives the\nhalo density: \u03c1halo = \u03c1DM + \u03c1gas = \u03c1gas \u03a9M /\u03a9b , where \u03a9M and \u03a9b are the present matter\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n18\n\n(baryons + dark matter) density parameter and baryon density parameter, respectively.\nThe foregoing assumes that the cluster baryon mass fraction follows the cosmic value\nof \u03a9b /\u03a9M ; this is expected to be generally true, although precise estimations of cluster\nbaryon content have shown deviations from the universal value (White et al. 1993;\nEttori 2000; Gonzalez et al. 2007).\nThe much used NFW model is a special case (\u03be = 1) of the functional form as in\nBiviano & Girardi (2003):\n\u03c1 (r) =\n\n\u03c10\n.\n(r/a) (1 + r/a)3\u2212\u03be\n\n(1.9)\n\n\u03be\n\nThe NFW model is obtained when the distribution of gas and DM in the background\nhalo follow analytical models of the DM density having a functional form as:\n\u03c1DM (r) =\n\n\u03c1s\n,\n(r/rs ) (1 + r/rs )2\n\n(1.10)\n\nwhere \u03c1s is a scaling density, and rs is a scale length (Navarro et al. 1997). The NFW\nprofile is often parametrized in terms of a concentration parameter c. The parameters\n\u03c1s and rs are then given by\n25H 2 (z)c3\n200c3 \u03c1crit (z)\n=\n,\n3 [ln (1 + c) \u2212 c/ (1 + c)]\n\u03c0G [ln (1 + c) \u2212 c/ (1 + c)]\nr\n= 200 ,\nc\n\n\u03c1s =\n\n(1.11)\n\nrs\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere \u03c1crit (z) = 3H 2 (z)/8\u03c0G is the critical density at formation redshift z, and r200 ,\nthe virial radius, is the radius of a sphere whose mean density is 200\u03c1crit (200 times\nthe critical density of the Universe at the epoch of formation). After scaling, the halo\ndensity profile is \u03c1halo = \u03c1DM \u03a9M /(\u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9b ).\nThe Hernquist model differs only in the exponent of the numerator, as below:\n\u03c1DM (r) =\n\n\u03c1s\n.\n(r/rs ) (1 + r/rs )3\n\n(1.13)\n\nThe mass density profile can also be approximated by:\n\u03c1 (r) =\n\n1.4\n\n(r/rs )\n\n\u03c10\n,\n(1 + r/rs )1.6\n\n(1.14)\n\nwith \u03c10 \u2248 5900\u03c1c and rs = 370 kpc. While the outer-region slope (\u03b1 \u2248 3) is steeper\nthen as given by Moore et al. (1998), both of these profiles agree as to the inner profiles\n(\u03b1 = 1.4; Lewis et al. 2000). More recent high resolution simulations all show \u223c r\u22121.5\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n19\n\nfor the inner profile, turning over to r\u22123 at large radii (Lewis et al. 2000; Moore 1998).\nThe above equation 1.14 matches the density profile of NFW at large radii but has a\nsteeper central cusp.\nThe simulations of this project use the above profiles (\u03b2 and the NFW profiles) to\nmodel the isolated cluster and subsequently the clusters in the simulated cosmological\nvolume. In the first case (\u03b2 model) it is assumed that the DM in the background halo\nfollows a density distribution similar to observations of the IC gas. The halo density is\nobtained by scaling the gas density with the universal ratio of matter (dark + baryonic)\nto baryons. The density profile is then integrated to obtain the background halo mass.\nIn a second case the halo mass is obtained by integrating over the NFW profile, with\nthe assumption that the distribution of gas and DM in the background halo both follow\nthe NFW profile. In a future project it might be possible to use a more detailed profile,\nperhaps bimodal, as suggested by the results of several researchers as below.\nParolin et al. (2003) find consistency between their results and other works in the\nliterature confirming the bimodal nature LF of cluster galaxies. Driver et al. (1994),\nstudying Abell 963 (z \u2248 0.2), in their analysis on a sample that reaches MR = \u221216.5,\nsimilarly find a LF that could be fit by a composition of two Schechter functions,\nor by a Schechter function plus a power law with slope \u22121 and \u22121.8 respectively\n(in reasonable agreement with other findings). Supportive results are also found by\nMolinari et al. (1998); and by Barkhouse et al. (2002), who analyze a very large sample of cluster galaxies as well as the LF of the first cluster of the sample used by\nParolin et al. (2003); namely their results corroborate a bimodal LF and a faint end\nslope, \u03b1 = \u22121.65 (Parolin et al. 2003).\nIt is possible that the LF condenses too much into three simple numbers, thus losing\nvaluable information. Driver (2004) stresses that the community should use the legacy\ndatasets to supercede the LF with for example two multivariate distributions: (bivariate) the luminosity-surface brightness plane (LSP), and the color-luminosity plane.\nGalaxy bulges and galaxy disks form marginally overlapping but distinct distributions\nin both planes. This indicates two key formation/evolutionary processes: merger and\naccretion.\nThe luminosity-surface brightness relation and the luminosity size distribution denote two LSPs. They are each readily transformed into the other, luminosity, size and\nsurface brightness being related by:\n\u03bceHLR = M + 2.5 log10 [2\u03c0R2HLR ] + 36.57,\n\n(1.15)\n\nwhere \u03bce is the effective surface brightness, M the absolute magnitude, and RHLR the\nsemimajor axis half-light radius in kpc (Driver 2004).\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\n20\n\nThe LSP offer a strong argument for their utility: both planes show that disks\nand bulges form distinct but overlapping distributions thus indicating secular evolution\nof these components (two mechanisms and two timescales). The LF is a useful global\nmeasurement of cluster properties, but this finding presents a strong motivation to begin\nmeasuring distinct components independently. The LSP appears to provide a direct\nmeeting ground to the numerical simulations. This is a most important result as it is\nthe cross-talk between simulations and observations that will ultimately bring about\nthe real insights into the processes of galaxy evolution and formation (Driver 2004).\nDriver (2004) further raises three questions as worthy of attention as the community\nengages, as he suggests, in quantifying the evolution of the LSP distributions across\nthe entire path length of the Universe: \"1) Which wavelength is optimal for structural\nstudies of galaxies? 2) How might we push back the boundaries into the dwarf regime?\nand 3) Can we connect structural measurements to the properties of the DM halo?\"\nTests concerning the internal structure of the DM halo are beyond the scope of\nthis project, but in other simulations aiming at explaining, for example the origin and\nnature of the cusp problem, the bimodality of cluster haloes, and other features of the\nDM structure, a bivariate distribution such as the LSP might be a useful modeling tool\nin a parallel way as the LF is used herein.\n\n\fChapter 2\nThe Isolated Cluster: Method\nWith a simple FORTRAN algorithm we simulated (243 simulations) the evolution of an\nisolated cluster of galaxies in order to examine the relationships between the different\nmethods of DG destruction.\nCareful selection of initial conditions, parameters, and simplifications was essential\nfor the successful implementation of the simulation of the isolated cluster. These simplifications and assumptions were deemed to be acceptable as they do not significantly\naffect the average outcome of the simulations.\nThe assumptions regarding the cluster simulations are as follows:\n\u2022Isolated\n\u2022Completely formed (comprising N galaxies, represented each by 1 particle, orbiting\ninside a background halo of uncollapsed DM and gas)\n\u2022Experiencing neither mergers with other clusters nor accretion of intracluster matter\n\u2022Comprised of a stationary (i.e. non-responsive to forces) spherically symmetric DM\nhalo, the density profile of which does not evolve with time\n\u2022Galaxies will incur one of six possible fates:\n(1) galaxy-galaxy merger\n(2) destruction by larger galaxy tidal field, with fragments accreting to larger galaxy\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n22\n\n(3) destruction by tides of larger galaxy, with dispersion into the IC medium\n(4) destruction by background halo's tidal field\n(5) galaxy survives to present\n(6) ejection from cluster\nThis part of the project simulates isolated, virialized clusters thus the simulations\nare not \"cosmological\". This not withstanding, the particular choice of cosmological\nmodel enters the picture twice: in the determination of the radii of galaxies, and in the\ncalculation of the elapsed time between the initial and final redshifts of the simulation.\nFor the cosmological model the assumptions made are as follows:\n\u2022\u039bCDM model\n\u2022Matter density parameter, \u03a9M = 0.241\n\u2022Baryon density parameter, \u03a9b = 0.0416\n\u2022Cosmological constant, \u03a9\u039b = 0.759\n\u2022Hubble constant, H0 = 73.2 Km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (h = 0.732)\n\u2022Primordial tilt, ns = 0.958, and\n\u2022Cosmic microwave background temperature, TCMB = 2.725K, consistent with the\nresults of WMAP3.\nThe remainder of this chapter details the author's contribution to the development\nof the simulations of the isolated cluster. The following chapter (Chapter 3) details the\nauthor's role in the development of a cosmological simulation that extends the results\nof the isolated cluster to a cosmological volume.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n2.1\n\n23\n\nCode and tests\n\nIn preparation for the simulations it was necessary to ascertain that the research project\nhad not already been carried out elsewhere. I carried out extensive searches in parallel\nwith other team members. These searches were carried out using various search engines such as NASA's Astrophysics Data System (a free tool available on the Internet),\narXiv.org, and annualreviews.org, among others. Articles deemed to be relevant were\nsummarized for subsequent group discussion. This search was continued beyond the\ninitial stages of the project.\nWhile conducting the literature search, the members of the research team examined\nthe particle particle (PP) code to be used. The PP code is written in Fortran 77.\nFortran is used in astrophysics simulations because of its speed with float operations.\nAdditionally, legacy code is often written in this language as translating to something\nmore modern, such as Fortran 90 would involve much unnecessary work. The standard\nPP code evolves a system of N gravitationally interacting particles using a second-order\nRunge-Kutta algorithm. It was to be used for the simulation of the isolated cluster\nafter modifications by the team to include interaction with the background halo, and\nthe additions of modules to deal with the subgrid physics. In the resulting, modified,\nalgorithm the number of particles N can vary, as the particles (galaxies) merge, are\ndestroyed by tides, or escape the cluster (Barai et al. 2009).\nThe system we model in this project is an isolated cluster comprising N galaxies of\nmass mi , radius si , and internal energy Ui (i = 1, . . . , N ), orbiting inside a background\nhalo of uncollapsed DM and gas. For many simulation runs cluster properties similar to\nwell observed clusters (Virgo, Perseus) were used. Galaxies in the code are represented\nusing one particle per galaxy. By comparison with contemporary simulations (i.e. 106\nparticles), this is a very small number. The use of subgrid physics, embodied in various\nsubroutines added subsequently, made it possible to use such a relatively small number\nof particles. In turn this permitted the use of a direct method (such as the PP code)\ninstead of a more complicated mesh algorithm, for example.\nBefore carrying out the actual simulations, it was decided that tests were necessary\nto ensure the simulation would begin on strong footing. These tests were carried out\nfor two particles in orbit and for a collapsing uniform sphere.\nPlugging two particles into the PP code yielded a test simulating the two particles\norbiting each other around a common center of mass.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n24\n\nFigure 2.1 Two particle test encounters precession: X-Y plane. Motion of the\ntwo test particles is shown on the right bottom panel for x-coordinate versus y-coordinate\npositions. Other panels: x-, y-, and z- position versus time. Precession is visible in the\nbox showing the trajectory in the X-Y plane.\n\nThe energies and velocities of the particles were as expected, and the particles orbited smoothly around a common center but the orbits precessed when the minimum\ndistance of approach between the particles was shorter than a given distance, the softening length \u000f (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2). The softening length in this test was necessary to\nprevent an infinite force as these point particles approached each other (in this test\nwe had set \u000f = 0.1). This is important in the subsequent calculation of the force each\nparticle exerts on other particles during the simulation.\nThe results of this test were analyzed jointly. The consensus for this test was that\nthe softening length was too large and that this led to particle overlap and the ensuing\norbital precession visible in the figures. Reducing the softening length (\u000f = 0.0005) also\ncorrected a similar problem in the kinetic energy plotted for the particles.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n25\n\nFigure 2.2 Motion of the two particles in the X-Z plane. Top left panel: zvelocity versus time; top right panel: potential energy versus time; bottom left panel:\nkinetic energy versus time; bottom right panel: total energy versus time. The velocities\nand energies varied in time as expected, with the kinetic energy reaching a peak as the\npotential energy is at a minimum.\n\nIn the second test particles collapsed (in the free-fall time) under gravity, from\nan initial spherical distribution centered at the origin (Figs. 2.3 \u2013 2.4). Although the\nparticles collapsed smoothly, they bounced towards the end of the collapse. At a time\nclose to the free-fall time, there was a reversing in the magnitudes of the potential and\nkinetic energies in the related plots (Fig. 2.4). Tuning \u000f eventually produced an ideal\nvalue of \u000f = 0.001. It was then decided that in the main simulation \u000f would be of order\nof the radius of the smallest galaxies.\n\n\fChapter 2.

The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n2.2\n\n28\n\nParameter searches\n\nSeveral parameters were required to describe the cluster, these are related to: halo and\ngalaxies, softening length, galaxy interactions, and to general simulation components.\nIt was decided that cooling flows, accretion to cluster, and galaxy formation would be\nignored (subsequently a treatment of cluster accretion was implemented). Important\nparameters to find in the literature were:\n\n\u2022 Mass or density cluster profile (from either X-ray luminosity or radial velocities)\n\u2022 Number of galaxies to be used\n\u2022 Galaxy mass spectrum N (m) (post-search, Schechter LF is used)\n\u2022 Relation mass-size for galaxies (observational and theoretical)\n\u2022 Initial positions and velocities of galaxies (caveat: massive galaxies near center)\n\u2022 Cluster formation epoch\n\n2.2.1\n\nDensity profile\n\nThere was an open question as to which density profile would be used in the simulations,\nbut as it was easy to model several by slightly modifying the code, it was decided that\nthe \u03b2 and the NFW models for the density profile of the cluster would be used. I had\nalso found that the \u03b2 model is widely thought to overestimate the mass, especially at\nlarge radii. Modeling various density profiles would allow comparison of the various\nresults.\n\n2.2.2\n\nCluster mass\n\nThe force exerted by the halo is proportional to M (r)/(r2 + \u000f2 )3/2 , where M (r) is the\nmass inside radius s, and \u000f is the softening length of the force. The original plan\nhad been to tabulate this quantity as a function of the radius. It became apparent\nthat each density profile would need a separate interpolation table for each value of\nthe softening length. To reduce the number of interpolation tables it was decided to\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n29\n\ntabulate the quantity M (r) only, with the division by (r2 + \u000f2 )3/2 being performed\nduring the simulation.\nThe code to make the tables maketable.f is presented in Appendix B. This code\nwas written by Dr. Martel and modified by myself. The code facilitates calculation\nof i.e. the \u03b2, NFW, King, and Hernquist mass profiles. In order to make the tables\nit was necessary to integrate over the function determining the desired profile. In\nmaketable.f, Smax represents the distance from the center, out to which it is desired\nto carry out the integration; whereas ds is the incremental step the integration procedure\nwill use for the iterations. The number of entries to the table corresponds to npt; this\nin turn gives the level of definition of the produced table.\nIn maketable.f, I modified sections of the code that included the algorithm for\nintegration. In order to decide on the boundaries (i.e. a distance for Smax, or a limit\nfor npt) I conducted several trial runs until the team had decided on the optimal values.\nIt was an interesting point in the project to find and define a physical correspondence\n(parameters Smax, ds, npt) between the cosmological object and numerical methods\nfor integral calculus. For instance, to correctly produce the interpolation tables, I had\nto define ds = Smax/npt.\n\n2.2.3\n\nInitial conditions\n\nIt was necessary to choose the initial mass m, radius r, position s, and velocity v of\neach galaxy in order to determine the initial conditions for the simulations.\nThe galaxies were assumed to follow a Schechter distribution, such as in equation 1.1.\nFrom this distribution, a Monte Carlo rejection method was used to select the luminosities of the galaxies. The masses were obtained using these luminosities by means\nof an assumed M/L.\nTo obtain the slope of the Schechter function of the galaxies in the simulations\npresented herein, it was necessary to plot the relevant luminosities within each run. I\nran a code that extracted the relevant values and I tabulated the results in a table to\nbe presented to the rest of the team. The relevant values were then extracted so as to\nfit the slope of the Schechter function as further detailed in the related article (Barai\net al. 2009; see Appendix A).\nOnce the initial conditions were decided, see Figure 2.5 for an example; and once\n\n\fChapter 2.

The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n31\n\nthe various modules of the PP code were in order, the last test run became the first\nsuccessful simulation run A.\nThe locations of galaxies inside the cluster were selected with the assumption that\ntheir distribution is statistically isotropic and using observations and conclusions from\nthe literature. To prevent overlap, however, and as a certain structure is expected in\nthe cluster (i.e. the most massive galaxies probably reside near the cluster center), the\nmost massive galaxy was positioned at the center of the cluster. The next seven most\nmassive galaxies were placed between radii R0 and 2R0 (where R0 is 3 times the radius\nof the most massive galaxy). The next nineteen most massive galaxies were placed\nbetween radii 2R0 and 3R0 . The remaining galaxies were placed randomly between\nradii 0 and 3R0 . The radius s of each galaxy is taken to be equal to the virial radius\nr200 . The initial velocity of each galaxy was obtained by taking the velocity a galaxy\nwould have if it were in perfect circular orbit and randomly varying the magnitude\nwithin a given range. To determine the direction of the velocities of the galaxies, a\nrandom angle generation technique was followed, similar to that used in generating the\ngalaxy positions.\n\n2.3\n\nSubgrid physics\n\nThe subgrid physics are effected by modules added to the PP code. These modules deal\nwith the six possible outcomes of the DG interactions in the simulations here presented.\nThese six outcomes are:\n\n\u2022 The galaxy merges with another\n\u2022 The galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of a larger galaxy, but the fragments\naccrete to that larger galaxy\n\u2022 The galaxy is destroyed by tides of a larger galaxy, and the fragments are dispersed\nin the IC medium\n\u2022 The galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of the background halo\n\u2022 The galaxy survives to the present (i.e. it is not destroyed by any process)\n\u2022 The galaxy is ejected from the cluster\n\nFigure 2.6 shows the geometry of the tides due to other galaxies in the simulation.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n32\n\nIn the code, the subgrid physics subroutines are named: tidesByHalo, encounter,\ntidesByGalaxy, collision, OutsideHalo, and GalxPresent. The module name describes the interaction with which it deals. I tested these subroutines, written by Dr.\nBarai, by adding one subroutine at a time, running the code and comparing the ensuing code outputs. Next the finished module was commented out, the next was added\nand the process was re-iterated. When a given subroutine appeared to be operating\ncorrectly the next one was added for subsequent testing. The main steps were adding\nmergers, tides, and harassment.\nThe amount of data generated in the run-up tests (and hence in the 243 subsequent\nruns) would be prohibitive were it not for the tree-structure directories of UNIX and\nvarious editing and plotting programs. I carried out tests for the various modules as\nthey were written, and organized and managed the storage of this data for plotting and\ncomparison. As the various modules progressed I ran the codes to compare the output\nwith previous tests. In subsequent runs B \u2013 I, I varied the active subroutine (with or\nwithout harassment), cluster properties, and DM profile (\u03b2 or NFW).\n\nFigure 2.6 Tides caused by other galaxies.

The Isolated Cluster: Method\n34\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n35\n\nThis series (series A) constituted 16 simulations, using for the background halo a \u03b2profile with \u03b2 = 0.33, a core radius rc = 3 kpc, and a central density \u03c10 = 8.14 \u00d7 10\u221226 g cm\u22123 ,\nwhich is appropriate for a cluster like Virgo (Piffaretti & Kaastra 2006). This series\ndoes not include galaxy harassment, or a cD galaxy. A total of 10 series were run,\ncomprising parameters as summarized in Table 2.1. We analyzed the data over several\ndiscussions; the resulting explanation is presented in the related article (Barai et al.\n2009; see Appendix A). Some details are excerpted here and summarized in the next\nchapter.\nTable 2.1 shows the run number in column 1, and in column 2 the total mass Mtotal in\ngalaxies at the beginning of the run (in units of 1011 M ). Column 3 shows the number\nof galaxies Ntotal . Columns 4 to 8 show the number of galaxies Nmerge destroyed by\ngal\nmergers; the number of galaxies Ntides\ndestroyed by tides caused by a massive galaxy,\nwith the fragments dispersed in the IC medium; the number of galaxies Naccr destroyed\nby tides caused by a massive galaxy, with the fragments being accreted onto that galaxy;\nhalo\ndestroyed by the tidal field of the background halo; and\nthe number of galaxies Ntides\nthe number of galaxies Neject ejected from the cluster, respectively. Column 9 shows\nthe fraction by numbers of galaxies fsurv that survive to the present. Column 10 lists\nthe values of fM , the mass fraction of galaxies contributing to the IC stars. Column\n11 lists the values of the total luminosity of the cluster coming from IC stars, fICS .\nColumn 12 shows the Schechter luminosity function exponent \u03b1start . The exponent\nwas obtained by performing a numerical fit to the distribution of galaxy masses. The\nmasses were determined using a Monte Carlo rejection method therefore the exponent\ncan differ slightly from the intended value \u03b1 = \u22121.28 (equation 1.1). Averaging over all\nruns yields \u03b1start = \u22121.280 \u00b1 0.020. Column 13 lists \u03b1end , the best fit to the Schechter\nfunction for the surviving galaxies in the given simulation.\nThere is no occurrence of a galaxy being destroyed by tides by the background halo,\nand the number of galaxies ejected is either 0 or 1. There are large variations in the\nother numbers from one run to the next, but some trends are apparent. Typically,\n50% \u2013 60% of the galaxies are destroyed. Run A2 is an extreme case, with 78% of the\ngalaxies being destroyed.\nThe destruction of galaxies by mergers dominated the destruction by tides by more\nthan a factor of 2 except for run A7. If the cases of tidal disruption followed by accretion\nare treated as being mergers, then mergers dominated tidal disruption even more. When\ngalaxies were destroyed by tides, the dispersion of fragments into the IC medium always\ndominated over the accretion of fragments to the massive galaxy, but the ratio varied\nwildly, from 114 : 7 in run A7 to 66 : 51 in run A8.\n\n\fChapter 2. The Isolated Cluster: Method\n\n36\n\nColumn 10 of Table 2.1 lists the values of fM , the mass fraction of galaxies contributing to the IC stars,\ngal\nhalo\nMtides\n+ Mtides\nfM =\n,\n(2.1)\nMtotal \u2212 Meject\nwhere M refers to the mass in galaxies, rather than the number of galaxies. The\ngalactic mass contribution to the IC medium consists of galaxies destroyed by the tides\nof another more massive galaxy and by the tides of the background halo (though in this\nseries there are no such cases). The galaxy masses are converted to luminosities using a\nmass-dependent M/L from the cold DM cosmological simulations of (Yang et al. 2003).\nThe fraction fICS of the total luminosity of the cluster that comes from IC stars\n(column 11) is calculated as per:\nfICS =\n\nhalo\nLgal\ntides + Ltides\n.\nLtotal \u2212 Leject\n\n(2.2)\n\nAgain, there were large variations; in particular the fraction was very large for\nrun A2 and very small for run A5. Averaging over all runs we found\nfICS = 0.271 \u00b1 0.095 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nEven though in most cases about half the number of galaxies were destroyed, the\ndestroyed galaxies tended to be low-mass galaxies; this explained why fICS < 1 \u2212 fsurv ,\nfor all the runs.\nThat the galaxies destroyed by mergers and tides or escaping were mostly low-mass\ngalaxies leads to a flattening of the galaxy mass distribution function. We computed:\n\n\u03b1end = \u22121.206 \u00b1 0.040 .\nas the best numerical fit to the Schechter LF.\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fChapter 3\nThe Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n3.1\n\nThe series - analysis\n\nThe results of the isolated cluster simulations are being published (Barai et al. 2009, see\nAppendix A). In this article a detailed account is presented of the simulations. Following\nis a description of my contribution to research related to the article, including execution\nof the numerous simulation runs; also following is a summary of the related results of\nthese simulations.\nTable 2.2, summarizes the various series of simulations. The first column in Table\n2.2 shows the series label. The remainder of each row details the properties of that\nseries. Column 2 gives the number of runs for each series. Column 3 gives the value of\n\u03b1start for each series. Column 4 tells which DM profile was used for each series and which\ncluster that profile resembles. Column 5 gives the value of \u03b2 used, when applicable.\nColumn 6 shows the value of the central density. Column 7 gives, for the NFW profile,\nthe concentration parameter. Column 8 gives the value of the core radius (the scale\nradius for the NFW profiles). Column 9 tells whether or not each run included a cD\ngalaxy. Column 10 shows whether or not each run included harassment. Column 11\nshows, for each run, whether or not there was cluster growth. The series thus represent\nvariations of the isolated cluster simulations. I carried out the simulations for series\nA, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J. I also carried out an unpublished \u03b2 profile series with\n\u03b1start = 1.34 and two Hernquist profile series with no cD galaxy and \u03b1start = 1.28 and\n1.31, respectively. It was jointly decided that the related article would present only the\nNFW and \u03b2 profile related simulations.\nFor each simulation run I obtained data that I then tabulated using LaTeX and\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n38\n\npresented to the rest of the group. Each series thus contains data similar to Table 2.1,\nwhich presents the results of the first meaningful simulation run. The runs in Table\n2.1 simulate a cluster with no massive cD galaxy at its center and with no galaxy\nharassment. This series uses the \u03b2-profile for the halo, with \u03b2 = 0.33, core radius\nrc = 3kpc, and a central density \u03c10 = 8.14 \u00d7 10\u221226 g cm\u22123 . These values are similar to,\nfor instance, the Virgo cluster (Piffaretti & Kaastra 2006).\nThe data obtained after activating the harassment module are given in series B.\nFrom the higher tide related destruction rate it was thought that the algorithms used\ncredibly modeled galactic harassment while maintaining a Schechter distribution of\ngalaxies throughout the simulated evolution of the cluster.\nVariations in the parameters were found to have predictable consequences consistent\nwith theory, such as in the increased number of ejections present in series C ensuing\nwhen the cD galaxy was particularly massive (which in turn increased the radius in\nthe criterion for initial positions of the galaxies). Further, using the results of the\nsimulations to this point and observations from the literature we calculated the slope\nof the obtained luminosity function in order to average and find the best fits.\nIncorporating a cD galaxy in the simulation (series D) resulted in an increase in\naccretions (i.e. by the cD galaxy) and in a lower fraction of IC stars imparted to the\nIC medium, predictably, as there is less mass available and there are a higher number\nof accretions.\nParameters such as those of the Perseus cluster (Piffaretti & Kaastra 2006), using\na \u03b2 profile, resulted in tidal destructions by the background halo (series E); this was\nprobably due to the steepness of the cluster density profile in this simulation. This\nconjecture is supported by the specifics of the destructions. A cD galaxy, when present\n(series F), competes for tidal disruptions with the background halo, although mergers\ncontinue to dominate tides.\nIn series G, H, and I simulated a cluster with NFW profile, while varying the slope\nof the LF and the presence of a cD galaxy. In the simulations of NFW clusters, a\nlarge number of galaxies were destroyed by the tidal field of the cluster halo. The\nnumber of halo-tide destructions is comparable to, or larger than that of the galaxytide destructions. This research team theorizes that this is due to the steepness (within\na given radius) of the NFW halo mass profile, resulting in galaxies near the cluster\ncenter experiencing a larger tidal field.\nFurther in series G, with a lower LF slope and no cD galaxy, it can be seen that the\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n39\n\nincrease in halo-tide destructions leads to mergers exceeding the galaxy-tide destructions; combined, however, the tide destructions by galaxy and cluster-halo compare to,\nor exceed mergers. An associated increase in the mass contributed to the IC stars is\nalso seen.\nSeries H and I (NFW, including harassment, and having a higher slope LF) are in\nkeeping with the above observations, although there are more accretions in run I, where\nthe cD galaxy is present (similar to series D and F). When the cD galaxy is present\ngalaxies approaching the cluster center tend to get destroyed by the tidal field of the\nhalo before the cD galaxy can have any effect. This plays a limiting role in the fraction\nof matter imparted to the IC medium.\nIn series J the background cluster-halo is allowed to accrete over time, 33% from\nz = 1 to z = 0, as per Wechsler et al. (2002). We find that this leads to a higher\nnumber of interactions, which in turn decreases the fraction of surviving galaxies.\n\n3.2\n\nCluster profile parameter dependence\n\nWith 60 simulations we explored the parameter dependence of the cluster profiles\n(\u03b1start = \u22121.36, with harassment, no cD galaxy). We explored the range 0.3 < \u03b2 < 1.0\n(at fixed rc and \u03c10 ), these being typical values as per the literature. The results of these\nsimulations and the joint analysis are summarized here (for details see Section 5 of the\nrelated article of Barai et al. 2009; Appendix A).\n\n3.2.1\n\nThe \u03b2 profile\n\nAn increase in \u03b2 causes a decline of galaxy interactions, hence an increase in the number\nof galaxies surviving to z = 0. With mostly the smaller galaxies merging, the number\nof mergers dominated the galaxy tides, but the merging mass fraction decreased below\nthe tidal destruction mass fraction (at \u03b2 < 0.6). As \u03b2 was increased from 0.3 to 0.6,\nhowever, it appeared that more massive galaxies were merging. At \u03b2 > 0.6 the galaxy\naccretion dominates the mass-fraction.\nThe IC stars luminosity comes dominantly from the DGs destroyed by the tides of\nmore massive galaxies. Exploring variations of the core radius rc between 10 \u2013 500 kpc\n(Table 12 in the related article of Barai et al. 2009; see Appendix A) showed that for\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n40\n\nsmall rc , mergers outnumber galaxy tides, are comparable to tides at rc \u2248 350 kpc, and\nthat tides dominate at large rc . As rc rises, a decreasing number of galaxies survive up\nto z = 0. This leads to an increase in the mass contributed to the IC medium. When\nrc > 50 kpc, the mass fraction is increasingly dominated by galaxy-tide destruction,\nwith the fragments being dispersed into the IC medium. The merged mass fraction,\nhowever, is significantly smaller than that of tidal destructions as the merging galaxies\nare mostly low mass. As rc increases, galaxy tides increase substantially by number\nand mass, while mergers remain almost constant.\n\n3.2.2\n\nThe Navarro, Frenk, and White profile\n\nThe dependence on the parameters governing the NFW model cluster halo density profile was explored with 35 simulations (\u03b1start = \u22121.31, with harassment, no cD galaxy).\nAs per the literature, typical values used for the scale radius are rs = 100 \u2013 500 kpc and\nfor the concentration parameter, c = 3 \u2013 6.\nWe investigated five different values of the scale radius rs within 10 \u2013 300 kpc, keeping\nthe concentration fixed at c = 4.5. With increase of rs , a smaller number of galaxies\nsurvive up to the present, causing greater mass to be transferred to the IC medium. Near\nrs \u2265 100 kpc, the mass fraction is increasingly dominated by halo tidal destructions.\nWhen rs is small, the number of mergers is higher than that of tide destructions; but at\nrs \u2248 300 kpc the numbers of mergers, galaxy-tide, and halo-tide destructions become\ncomparable. The merged mass fraction, however, is comparable to that of galaxy-tide\ndestructions; these are both dominated by halo-tide destruction.\nIt seems that as rs increases, lower-mass galaxies are tidally destroyed by other\ngalaxies; the galaxy-tide destructions decrease in number but increase in mass.\nVarying the concentration parameter to c = 4 and 6 with a fixed value of the scale\nradius rs = 100 kpc, it was found that the mergers continued to outnumber the tides.\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\n41\n\nDiscussion\nMergers and tides\n\nIn the \u03b2 model, destruction by mergers dominates destruction by tides; in the NFW\nmodel they are of comparable importance.\nThe relative importance of mergers over tides is arrived at by calculating the average\n(over all runs of each simulation) of the fractions below as per the related article (Barai\net al. 2009; see Appendix A):\n\nNmerge + Naccr\n,\nNdestroyed\n\n(3.1)\n\ngal\nhalo\n+ Ntides\nNtides\n,\n=\nNdestroyed\n\n(3.2)\n\nmergers\n=\nfdestroyed\ntides\nfdestroyed\n\ngal\nhalo\n.\nwhere Ndestroyed = Nmerge + Ntides\n+ Naccr + Ntides\n\nBy contrast, increasing values of the core radius rc of the \u03b2 model or increasing\nthe scale radius rs of the NFW model leads to a reduced number of mergers and a\ngrowing number of tide destructions, for instance, at rc \u2265 400 kpc or rs \u2265 300 kpc tides\noutnumber mergers.\nAs per the simulations herein, the destruction of DGs alone cannot explain the\nobserved IC light. While most of the galaxies destroyed by tides are dwarfs (i.e. run\nC3), the destruction of a few galaxies of mass M > 1011 M provides more than 60%\nof the IC light. To account for all the IC light, we conclude that some intermediate\nmass or massive galaxies are getting destroyed by the tidal field of the most massive\ngalaxy. This is viable as the mass ratios between the most massive galaxy and the\ndestroyed high-mass galaxies are of order 3 \u2013 5. Other possible explanations are: (1)\nclusters contain many times more DGs than predicted by a Schechter distribution, or\n(2) DGs have a much lower M/L than assumed. These are both unlikely.\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n3.3.2\n\n42\n\nIntracluster stars\n\nThe LF of the observed IC stars in clusters falls well within the predictions of the\nsimulations herein. The obtained results indicate that the tidal destruction of galaxies\n(by other galaxies and by the cluster halo) in clusters is sufficient to explain the observed\nfraction of IC light; this is supported by observational studies, which find a significant\nIC light component arising from DGs in clusters.\nResults from the simulations presented indicate that for the \u03b2 and NFW models,\nfICS increases with the mass of the cluster halo, which is consistent with studies in the\nliterature (Lin & Mohr 2004; Murante et al. 2004).\n\n3.4\n\nConclusion\n\nAreas to Improve\nIncluding the dynamic friction caused by the halo would result in galaxies falling into\nthe cluster center earlier in the simulation. We believe starting the interactions (and\ndestructions) earlier would not have a significant effect on the final results; we believe\nalso that the method used is sound, although generation of the initial conditions involves\nsome tunable parameters.\nThree possible areas of improvement in methodology are in the treatment of galaxy\nharassment, the simplified approach with which galactic encounters are treated (specifically the energy dissipation thereby), and our idealization of an isolated cluster in\nequilibrium (although we believe the cluster can be treated as isolated after the epoch\nof its major mergers).\n\nResults\nThe approach used enabled us to perform a large number of simulations and cover a\nlarge parameter space, while obtaining statistically significant results. In a simulation\nusing a large number of particles to represent each galaxy it would be more difficult to\nestablish the relative importance of mergers versus tidal disruptions.\n\n\fChapter 3. The Isolated Cluster: Results\n\n43\n\nThe results and conclusions are as follows.\n\n\u2022 The destruction of DGs by mergers dominates destruction by tides. The simulations presented in the foregoing show a dependence on the scale/core radius.\n\u2022 The destruction of galaxies by the tidal field of other galaxies and by the cluster\nhalo is sufficient to account for the observed fraction of IC light in galaxy clusters.\nThere is an increase of fICS with the mass of the cluster halo, as also supported\nby the literature. Our estimate of the IC light fraction is fairly robust.\n\u2022 In clusters simulating the NFW model, the large number of cluster-halo tidal\ndestructions dominates the mass fraction. In discussing this point, we noted a\npossible solution to the cusp crisis of DM halos: the central cuspy region of the\ncluster DM halo could have inelastic encounters with the member galaxies; this\ncould have the effect of injecting energy into the halo and erasing the cusp.\n\u2022 In the simulations presented above, the presence of a cD galaxy increases occurrences of accretion, decreases cluster-halo tidal destructions, and reduces the\nIC stars luminosity fraction. This is opposite to the trend found in observations\n(where fICS is higher in cD clusters).\n\u2022 The destruction of high-mass galaxies (M > 1011 M ) is required, as dwarfs alone\ndo not contain enough stars to account for the observed IC light, even if they were\nall destroyed. A few high-mass galaxies thus must also be destroyed, although\nthe vast majority of galaxies destroyed by tides are DGs.\n\n\fChapter 4\nThe Cosmological Volume\n\n4.1\n\nMethod\n\nThe cosmological volume part of the simulation refined the crude assumption of an\nisolated cluster in equilibrium. A standard particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) algorithm (Hockney & Eastwood 1988) was used with comoving coordinates that expand\nalong with the Hubble flow and facilitate calculations (see Appendix C). Particles representing DGs were created in high-density regions. These particles were allowed to\ngravitate together and merge to form more massive galaxies that in turn gravitated\ntogether to form clusters. This required the DG mass to be significantly larger than\nthat of the P3M particles. In this way the dynamical range of the simulation allowed us\nto model a cosmological volume of the Universe while resolving DGs. The simulation of\nthis second half of the project used the same initial conditions as previous P3M runs.\nWhile working on the isolated cluster I carried out one such run to generate experimental initial conditions. As in the first part of the project, one module at a time was\nadded to the P3M code in order to conduct tests.\nAfter a calibrating run the parameters of the simulation runs were modified to meet\ntime and computational constraints (Appendix D). It was desired that the galaxies be\nsignificantly more massive than the DM particles. In the first part of the simulation\nMmin = 1 \u00d7 109 M was used (the upper mass range of DGs as defined in section 1.1).\nWith this value of Mmin , DGs would be only 7 times more massive than DM particles,\nwhich was not considered enough. For this second part of the project then, the value\nused was Mmin = 2 \u00d7 109 M . This value was 14 times that of the mass of the DM\nparticles, which was deemed sufficient. In order to save time, tests were carried out in\na 40 Mpc box, forming 1 or 2 massive clusters with 2563 particles.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n4.2\n\n45\n\nCreating the particles\n\nIn order to create the initial conditions, I set an initial run using a 40 Mpc box and\n2563 particles with a 5123 grid. This involved changing settings for volume, number\nof particles, and grid. This is effected by modifying the 'include' files, the zeldo.inc\nand nadia.inc related to the P3M code. The nadia.inc file is changed as per the\nprescription shown in Table 4.1 according to the desired parameters of each run.\nAfter this I modified the parameters of the run in the par z.dat file (see Table 4.2).\nThis file contains the cosmological parameters governing the simulation as well as the\nrun-identifier consisting of three sequential characters that vary according to the given\nrun. A working knowledge of UNIX was very helpful to manage and handle large data\nfiles such as the initial conditions generated.\nTo test the algorithm for forming galaxies (and later for the subgrid physics) the\ninitial conditions from the 40 Mpc run mentioned above were used, with one timesaving modification. The file was modified so as to stop the run when the density\nreached 200\u03c1mean . This was because no galaxy forms between z \u2248 25 and z \u2248 9. The\ndensity reached 200\u03c1mean at z = 8.79. All parameters produced for the galaxy particles\nand the DM particles at this redshift were saved in a file to be used in subsequent tests.\nThe specific prescription to create DGs (M = Mmin ) was discussed a few times: it\nwas decided to create galaxies in high-density regions and reduce the mass of neighboring DM particles. In this way, the number of particles (DM + DG) would increase, but\nthe total mass would remain constant. When a galaxy is created, the code reduces the\nmass of the neighboring DM particles to conserve mass. The velocity of the created\ngalaxy is also adjusted in order to conserve momentum. A radius si is assigned to each\ngalaxy, similarly to what was done in the first part of the project. A check was implemented to ensure that a galaxy was not created inside the radius of an existing galaxy.\nAs we had not kept to a simple spherical background cluster with a particular density\nprofile, it was necessary to implement a special way to handle tidal destruction by the\nbackground matter. More specifics will be available in an upcoming article, concerning\nthe cosmological volume part of the simulation (Brito et al. 2009).\nBecause in the adopted prescription for the creation of galaxies the DM particles and\ngalaxies enter the gravity calculation in exactly the same way, it was decided, in order\nto keep track of the galaxy particles, to expand the arrays handling the DM particles\nand to add the galaxies at the end of these arrays.\n\n\fChapter 4.

The Cosmological Volume\n\n47\n\nI therefore modified the P3M code as follows:\n1) In order to make the arrays bigger, to accommodate the galaxies, I modified the file\nnadia.inc by adding the line: parameter (ntotmax= 1.2 \u2217 np). Note that np is the\nnumber of DM particles.\n2) I replaced the dimension np of arrays in the code by ntotmax, as necessary.\n3) I then added to the main code the common block: common /galaxies/ ngal.\n4) Next, I searched the code for subroutines that looped over all particles and added\nthe common block at the beginning of each subroutine (tantamount to initializing the\nvariable). I also replaced np by np+ngal in each such subroutine, for instance, in the\nsubroutine pppm. I repeated this process in the main module. One exception to these\nchanges is that in the subroutine assmass, the loop was split into two. One loop handles\nthe DM and the other handles the galaxies (loops 35 and 135 in the main code).\n5) Additionally, to permit breaking the runs into portions, it was necessary to specify\nin the code the initial number of galaxies (ngal). This number was specified by adding\nto the param.dat file the line: 0 number of galaxies. This line could be read by the\ncode after adding, where necessary, the line read(1,*) ngal.\nAs a result of these changes a galaxy in the simulations herein can have three possible\nstates: passive, active, and inexistent. Galaxies are active when they are created. Then\none of two things can happen:\n1) An active galaxy can be destroyed by tides: it becomes passive.\n2) Two active galaxies can merge: one becomes inexistent, the other remains active and\nacquires the total mass and momentum of the two galaxies (a tidal destruction followed\nby accretion is treated as a merger).\nIn loops like do i = 1, np + ngal or do i = np + 1, np + ngal there were two\npossibilities for keeping track of the galaxies after the interaction: in the P3M code,\nthe inexistent galaxies are excluded but the active and passive galaxies are included;\nor, in the subgrid physics, the inexistent and passive galaxies are excluded and only\nthe active galaxies are included. In this way the code keeps track of the fragments of\na galaxy that has been destroyed by tides. At the end of the simulation clusters are\nidentified and the passive particles in each cluster are examined to find what proportion\nof IC stars they contain.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n48\n\nAfter further changes to the code I carried out another test run, changing the final\nredshift in the param.dat file. I plotted relevant results of this run including the\nGAA create file (contains information about the galaxies being created), the fort.91\nfile (contains the total mass at every step), and the GAA cpu file. Soon, the bulk of the\ngalaxy creation module had been tested and the module was completed.\nNext the number of galaxies being produced was adjusted and the modules for\nmerger, accretion, and harassment were tuned.\nGalaxy creation issues\nA galaxy is created when the density of DM particles at a given cell exceeds a\nthreshold value (\u03c1 > 200\u03c1mean ). The cells in the grid with \u03c1 > 200\u03c1mean all have\nan equal probability of a galaxy being created at that point. If a cell has a density\nsignificantly larger then 200\u03c1mean , it is possible that two galaxies are created there (i.e.\nif after a galaxy has been created there, but the density is still significantly greater than\n200\u03c1mean , a second galaxy can be created there at the next timestep). For conservation\nof mass, once a galaxy has been created at a given point, surrounding DM particles\n(around the center of mass) have their mass lowered by the code. The velocity of\nneighboring DM particles is also adjusted in order to conserve momentum.\nWe encountered a problem that the DM particles surrounding cells where galaxies\nwere created had their masses reduced into negative numbers. To understand this\nproblem, we compared the redshift at which particles started to have negative masses\nwith, for example, the time at which mergers occurred, and with the total mass of\ngalaxies created by a given redshift. This problem of negative mass particles persisted\nas successive modules were activated. Various alternatives were explored in successive\nruns, for example, varying bias. The quantity bias was introduced in the P3M code\nto control the probability that a galaxy particle is created at a given cell. Peak cells\nare ascribed a certain probability and a galaxy is created, or not, depending on that\nprobability. The quantity bias has a factor adjustable according to time elapsed in\nthe simulation. Initially bias was set at 6.0 \u00d7 103 , according to the elapsed time in\ncomputational units (1 time unit = 7.7646 \u00d7 104 Myr). This value of bias makes the\ncell probability \u223c 0.5 at z \u2248 9.\nThe above problem was explained by the fact that galaxies were being created\nrepeatedly at, or near the same points. When this occurred, the neighboring particles\nhad their mass decreased successively, causing them to have negative masses at times.\nOn subsequent test runs, in order to determine how to constrain the value of bias,\nthe total mass in the galaxies created was plotted versus the redshift from the file\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n49\n\nGAA gal Num Mass.\nThe problem was finally corrected by changing the probability weighting. In the\ncode this was done by replacing the line weight(nbnb) = exp(-0.5*dr2/w2) by the\nline weight(nbnb) = pmass(m)*exp(-0.5*dr2/w2).\nDuring the efforts to solve the negative mass problem, and in order to select the\nvalue to be used for \u03a9gal , we experimented with various bias factors by running several\ntest runs up to z = 6. I plotted the total mass in galaxies versus redshift in order to\ndetermine the appropriate bias for creating a given number of galaxies. To obtain these\nplots, I used an IDL code that plotted the desired quantities from the GAA gal Num Mass\nfile related to the P3M code.\nFor these various runs we compared the amount of mass being created in the galaxies\nby plotting versus redshift for different values of bias. A run was executed, commenting\nthe bias factor out, to determine the maximum mass that could be produced (Fig. 4.1).\nThe value of bias was then adjusted such that the mass ending up in galaxies would\ntotal \u03a9gal \u2248 0.03. This test was repeated with this value of bias. The target was\nto have about 10% of the final mass in galaxies, and the rest in P3M particles. In\norder to monitor the test runs it was frequently necessary to make plots to compare\ncharacteristics of the tests and the simulations; for example Figure 4.1, with a bias value\nof 0, served to gauge if enough matter was being created, whereas Figure 4.2 served to\nmonitor the distribution of the matter in the halo.\n\n4.3\n\nTest runs for subgrids\n\nTesting the subgrid physics in the cosmological volume part of the simulation followed\na course analogous to that in the isolated cluster. The subroutines were added one\nat the time and tested until it was deemed each was working as desired. We resolved\nseveral problems in the course of testing.\n\n\u2022 The subroutine accrete checks, for each galaxy, if there are DM particles inside\nthe radius of the galaxy. Particles within that radius are accreted. The mass,\ncenter-of-mass position, and center-of-mass velocity are conserved. The old DM\nparticle still exists, but its mass set to zero. When the module accrete was\nincorporated into the code, I carried out runs and made plots for comparison\nwith previous tests.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n50\n\nFigure 4.1 Total mass at a given redshift. This represents part of the experimentation carried out to determine the desired value of bias. In this figure bias = 0.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n51\n\nFigure 4.2 Halo mass versus geometrical factor. This plot was generated to determine if the geometrical factor used could reproduce a reasonable halo mass. The\nlinking-length (0.171 in this plot), is important when determining the particles that\nbelong to the halo.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n52\n\nThe test run including the accrete subroutine was excessively slow, i.e. it took\n327 steps to reach z = 6 (29 hours) compared with previous runs without the\naccrete subroutine (92 steps to reach z = 6, duration < 18 hours). This problem\nwas solved by changing the timestep subroutine to exclude from the calculation\nof the timestep particles whose mass had been set to 0. This increased the length\nof the timesteps and reduced the run duration.\n\u2022 Analogous problems were encountered in the subroutine creategal: it allowed\ngalaxies that had been destroyed to continue having interactions with other galaxies (their mass had been diminished to zero but the particles had been kept to\nkeep track of the IC medium). This problem was fixed by excluding the massless\nparticles from those loops after the merger had been processed.\n\u2022 The same problem as above was encountered in the tidal destruction subroutine.\n\u2022 There appeared to be runaway increase in sizes of galaxies. At times galaxies\nattained almost 1/10th of the total mass inside the box. Subsequent multiple\nharassments at the same timestep caused the galaxy to experience an uncontrolled\nincrease in size, beyond the size of the box. A size cutoff was stipulated for the\ngalaxies in the simulation by incorporating a cutoff size for the galaxies in the\nparameter sizM AXcgs initialized in the subroutine ComovToPhysical.\n\nAs a side effect of excluding the massless particles, there were fewer interactions\nin the test runs. In contrast to the isolated cluster, where galaxies grew by mergers\nonly, in this, the cosmological volume part of the simulation, galaxies could grow by\naccretion. This resulted in a lower number of mergers. A test run was conducted after\nthe exclusion of the massless particles. The test run created 9682 galaxies with a total\nmass of 0.3079 (including those tidally disrupted and those going to IC light).\nA histogram of the mass distribution of galaxies in the run including accretion\nshowed that the total mass in the galaxies followed the prescription used herein but\nthat the mass distribution did not follow the Schechter distribution (therefore was not\ncorrect according to observations). Indeed, in the obtained distribution there were very\nfew DGs. This problem was addressed by fixing a threshold lower than 200\u03c1mean in the\ngalaxy formation criterion.\nThe test runs had begun, initially, in a 40 Mpc box (Mbox \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 1015 M ). While\nthese runs yielded a reasonable cluster mass, it was necessary to redo several test runs,\nbecause of the change in galaxy formation criterion to a threshold lower than 200\u03c1mean\n(as a fix for one of the bugs). It was also considered that in view of time pressures\nfuture test runs would be effected in a 20 Mpc box with 1283 particles.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n53\n\nThe new test runs thus used a 20 Mpc box (total mass Mbox = 2.95 \u00d7 1014 M ). A\nproblem ensued: the simulation produced only a very small mass of IC stars. The vast\nmajority of the tidal disruptions led to accretions, with little material going to the IC\nmedium. It was thought that, as the IC light fraction increased with increasing cluster\nhalo mass, this problem would disappear when simulating a much bigger box. Another\npossible explanation was that, with the current small volume used in the simulation, the\ngalaxies never encountered the gravitational potential of any massive cluster (since the\nclusters forming in a 20 Mpc box are much less massive) and their resulting velocities\nwere thus smaller.\nIt was also thought that some galaxies had simply been created very close to each\nother, their gravitational potential energy thus being higher than their kinetic energy,\nleading to quick accretions. It was considered that if the merger condition were loosened\nby checking for mergers whenever rij = Si +Sj , some of the accretions might be counted\nas mergers, thus solving the problem.\nA test run was effected at this point, with the parameters modified as detailed above\nand including the subgrid physics. The time for this full test run was \u223c two weeks.\nAs the tests progressed the mass distribution plots revealed that the simulation was\nbeginning to produce realistic results. Figure 4.3 was used to monitor the shape of the\ncorresponding luminosity function, and Figure 4.4 was used as another way to monitor\nthe distribution of matter and voids.\n\n4.4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe cosmological part of the simulation presented herein is at a very exciting point at\npresent. The modules for subgrid physics are working in a realistic way. The latest\ntest run produces a Schechter-like distribution (Fig. 4.3). This test run includes the\ngalaxy creation module as well as the mergers module. A slice of the distribution of\nparticles in the 20 Mpc volume is shown in Figure 4.4. This shows a slice of thickness\ncorresponding to 4 Mpc of a test run in a 20 Mpc box. There is an ongoing problem:\nthe remaining module, for tidal disruption by the background halo, does not work as\ndesired in the test runs. As mentioned in the foregoing, there is currently not enough\nmatter being imparted to the IC medium.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n54\n\nFigure 4.3 Schechter function reproduced.

This run used a 20 Mpc box; the\nplot shows the location of the P3M particles in a slice of thickness 4 Mpc.\n\n\fChapter 4. The Cosmological Volume\n\n56\n\nThe reason for this could be the small size of the test box used and the correspondingly\nsmall amount of matter in this box. It is thought that there is a number of accretions\nthat would be counted as mergers, were the galaxies moving in a more massive system\n(the merger criterion was satisfied too easily in the reduced volume). Were the galaxies\nexperiencing interactions, i.e. encounters, or background halo tides, they would have\nlarger kinetic energy (hence larger velocities). Tests while correcting this problem are\nexpected to be time-consuming beyond the time allotted for a master's degree research\nproject, hence I obtained permission to present the results to-date. Further progress will\nbe presented in an article (Brito et al. 2009). The Schechter distribution reproduced\nfrom tests until now, combined with the success of the merging module, and previous\nencouraging results from the isolated cluster (agreement with accepted theory) make us\noptimistic that this problem will shortly be resolved. We will then be able to launch the\nmain 80 Mpc simulation, expected to take \u223c1 month to complete. Ideally, the analysis\nof that simulation will show that the results from the isolated cluster carry over to an\nactual cosmological volume where non-spherical clusters have evolved under gravity.\nThe next step is to 'turn on the tides' (include the module that keeps track of tidal\nforces by the halo) and carry out test runs that will tell us if we are ready to expand\nthe test volume to the full 80 Mpc cosmological volume. These test runs were originally\nto be carried out in a 20 Mpc volume, but will instead be carried out in a volume large\nenough that the total mass in the box will be at least comparable to the mass of a\ncluster. In order for the numbers obtained to be significant statistically, the final run\nmust be carried out in a volume large enough to form several clusters (\u223c100 Mpc).\nThe results for the isolated cluster simulation (part 1 of this project) were in agreement with the fraction of IC stars currently thought to be due to tidal disruption.\nIf this cosmological volume simulation (part 2 of this project) continues to reproduce\nnumbers comparable to the accepted theory, and if the distributions of M/L continue to\nreproduce a Schechter function it will be strong support for the validity and significance\nof the method used.\n\n\fAppendix A\nArticle 1: The Fate of Dwarf\nGalaxies in Clusters and\nthe Origin of Intracluster Stars\nThis article was accepted in March, 2009, for publication in the Journal of Astrophysics\nand Astronomy, Volume 30, Number 1, pp. 1-36.

Although this means that the simulation box is expanding, the galaxies themselves are not expanding. The box expands along with the Universe, so that the mass\ninside the box remains constant. The box gets larger and larger relative to the galaxies.\nIf coordinates are used in which the box had a fixed size of 1, then in those coordinates\nthe galaxies would shrink with time. In physical units the box size and the initial size\nof galaxies scale like 1/(1 + z), so in computational units, they are both constant. The\nbox expands with time, but the galaxies do not. In computational units, the box is\nfixed and the galaxies shrink.\nThe P3M code used utilizes a special form of comoving coordinates, denoted by a\ntilde, called supercomoving variables (Martel & Shapiro 1998). To convert the peculiar\nvelocities to actual velocities it is necessary to convert the coordinates before calculating\nquantities such as the kinetic energy.\nIn supercomoving variables there is a precise normalization for the scale factor. The\nnormalization depends on the particular cosmological model. For the models considered\nhere (where \u03a90 is the density parameter, a is the scale factor, \u03bb0 is the cosmological\nconstant, and the subscript '0' denotes the values at the present time) the solution of\nthe Friedmann equation and the present value of the scale factor are, as per Martel and\nMatzner (1999):\n1. Einstein de Sitter model: (\u03a90 = 1, \u03bb0 = 0):\n\n\fAppendix C. Coordinate conversion\n\n64\n\n\u22122\n\na = t\u0303 , a0 = 1.\n\n(C.1)\n\n2.

Therefore, for all the models included in\nthe database (the database as in Martel & Matzner 1999), there are only three different\nsolutions of the Friedmann equation.\nThe positions s and velocities u in physical units are given by:\n\nr=\n\n\uf8ee\n\nLbox r\u0303\n,\n1+z\n\n1/2\n\n(C.4)\n\n\uf8f9\n\nH(z)r\u0303 \u03a90 H0 (1 + z)\u1e7d \uf8fb\nu = Lbox \uf8f0\n+\n,\n1/2\n1+z\n2a0\n\n(C.5)\n\nwhere H(z) is the Hubble constant as a function of redshift (H0 denoting its value at\nthe present epoch). The size of the box being considered is Lbox and v is the peculiar\nvelocity.\n\n\fAppendix D\nBox Volume and Particle Size\nIn the run used as guide to determine the timeframe for the project, the number of\nparticles used in the cosmological volume (120 Mpc box) was 1283 . The mass per particle\nthis implied1 was \u223c 3 \u00d7 1010 M - approximately 30 times the minimum galaxy mass\nused in the isolated cluster simulations (Mmin = 1 \u00d7 109 M ).\nTo avoid carrying out a simulation that would last several months we could not\nsimply increase the number of particles arbitrarily. At that time a final run had been\nenvisioned using 5123 particles. This would reduce the mass to 4.86 \u00d7 108 M (smaller\nthan Mmin by a factor of 2).\nUsing an 80 Mpc box the particle mass would be further reduced to 1.44 \u00d7 108 M\n(about 1/7 Mmin ), which would allow increasing Mmin to 2 \u00d7 109 M (a factor of 2).\nThis Mmin 14 times larger than the particle mass used in the isolated cluster simulations\nwas deemed to be a good choice. The estimated time for such a run to complete was\n\u223c1 month. With these modifications it was decided to 'tune' the code running tests\nwith a box size of 40 Mpc; the 1 or 2 massive clusters that would be produced were\ndeemed adequate. In tests, 2563 particles would be used to reduce running time. For\nthis volume, the mass scaling yielded 2563 particles. These tests would require only a\nfew days and would be carried out as the code advanced. For example, a test run was to\n1\n\nIn computational units the mass of the box is 1, the dimension of the box is 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1, and thus\nthe mean density is 1. Since the mass is 1, for N P equal-mass particles, the mass per particle is 1/N P\n(as in the zeldo.inc code). In physical units the box is Lbox \u00d7 Lbox \u00d7 Lbox . The volume is thus L3box .\nThe mass inside the box is the volume times the mean density inside the box. (The box represents a\ncosmological volume so its mean density is equal to the mean density of the Universe \u03c1mean .) Thus:\nMbox = \u03c1mean \u00d7 L3box = \u03a90 \u00d7 \u03c1crit \u00d7 L3box = 3 \u00d7 H02 \u00d7 \u03a90 \u00d7 L3box \u00d7 1/8\u03c0G. Note that as usual G is the\ngravitational constant, H0 the Hubble constant, and \u03a90 the density parameter. Dividing the mass of\nthe box by 1283 gives the mass per particle.\n\n\fAppendix D. Box Volume and Particle Size\n\n66\n\nbe carried out once the addition was effected of the code that accounts for tidal force by\nthe background matter (the cluster was no longer restricted to being spherical). These\ntests would serve, for example, to ensure that there were enough galaxies being formed\nin the simulation and to ascertain that the luminosities of galaxies created, actually\nfollowed a Schechter distribution (Fig. 4.3).\n\n\fBibliography\nArnaboldi, M. 2004, P.-A.
