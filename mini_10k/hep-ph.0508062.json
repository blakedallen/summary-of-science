Introduction\nA nice feature of recent results from BABAR, BELLE, CESAR and FERMILAB is the historically unprecedented number of points in the Dalitz\ndiagrams obtained for decays like D0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K\u03040 . It is not only favorable\nfor learning more about CP violation and associated problems in the weak\ninteractions but for learning about properties of resonances in the strong\ninteractions. This involves a resonance dominated description 1 (so-called\nisobar model) as illustrated in Fig. 1. Typically, a Breit-Wigner shape as\nwell as an arbitrary overall complex number is assumed for each resonance.\nWhile it is hard to rigorously justify such a procedure from fundamental\nQCD, it is made plausible by the large NC approximation 2 which actually\nsuggests that such a procedure should hold when the resonances are quark\nanti-quark composites. Of course, this kind of procedure has worked very\nwell in the past for many established resonances like the \u03c1(770).\nRecently, there has been a great deal of interest (See ref3 -ref7 ) in the\npossibility of observing the seemingly elusive light scalar mesons, like the\nsigma (f0 (600)) and its strange analog, kappa, from such Dalitz diagrams.\nEvidence for their existence had been previously obtained by many workers\n1\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n2\n\n\u03a3\n\nD\n\nR\n\n\u03c0\n\nWEAK\n\u03c0\n\n(R)\n\nK\n\n+ Strange resonance contributions\nFigure 1.\n\nIsobar model for the decay D \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 K\u0304\n\nbased on constructing theoretical models and comparing with experimentally obtained phase shifts. This evidence suggests that these resonances\nare \"hidden\"- they do not have obvious Breit Wigner shapes but seem to\ncontain a lot of interference with the background. Furthermore, their structure seems more likely to be two quarks- two antiquarks rather than quarkantiquark; this is deduced from the fact that, when amalgamated in a putative SU(3) nonet, they display an upside-down ordering with the degenerate\niso-singlet, isotriplet states (f0 (980), a0 (980)) appearing as heaviest rather\nthan lightest members. It should be noted that such a \"four quark\" structure is theoretically disfavored for resonances in the leading tree order of the\nlarge Nc approximation. So, on both experimental and theoretical grounds,\none may expect that the parameterization of these possible resonances in\nthe Dalitz analysis might very well be different from the parameterization\nof ordinary quark- antiquark resonances.\nWhat is the crucial ingredient in a suitable parameterization of low\nenergy scalar resonances? We will argue that it is chiral symmetry.\n2. Chiral symmetry\nThe problem of the scalar channel in pion physics goes back about fifty\nyears. Using the Yukawa (pion exchange) model, the value of the pi-nucleon\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n3\n\ncoupling constant, g\u03c0N N was well established from the long distance behavior of the nucleon- nucleon potential. However, when this value of coupling\nconstant was applied to try to calculate the s-wave pion nucleon scattering\nlength using the nucleon exchange diagrams, the answer turned out to be\nmore than ten times larger than experiment. The cure was eventually realized to involve upgrading the iso-spin or SU(2) symmetry to two separate\niso-spin symmetries for the left and right handed components of the nucleon. This chiral SU(2) symmetry would be manifest if the nucleons were\nmassless. However, Nambu had the insight to propose that the symmetry is\nthere anyway and that the nucleon receives a mass because the symmetry is\n\"spontaneously broken\". The simplest realization of this mechanism is embodied in the Gell Mann - Levy linear sigma model 8 . The chiral symmetry\nmeson multiplet in this model contains, in addition to the pions, a scalar\nparticle denoted the sigma. When the mass of the sigma is considerably\nhigher than the pion mass, the effect of sigma exchange cancels out almost\nall of the much too large result for the s-wave pion nucleon scattering and\nleaves the right answer.\nThe same situation prevails for the s-wave pion pion scattering amplitude. The meson part of the chiral invariant linear sigma model Lagrangian\nis given in terms of the pion and sigma fields as:\n1\nL = \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0 * \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u2202\u03bc \u03c3) + a(\u03c3 2 + \u03c0 2 ) \u2212 b(\u03c3 2 + \u03c0 2 )2 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the real parameters a and b are both taken positive to insure spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry. The vacuum value h\u03c3i of the \u03c3 field\nis related to the pion decay constant as\n\u221a\nF\u03c0 = 2 h\u03c3i ,\n(2)\nwhere F\u03c0 = 0.131 GeV. The parameter a is given by\na=\n\n1 2\nm ,\n4 \u03c3B\n\n(3)\n\nwhere m\u03c3B is the tree level (or bare) value of the sigma mass. The only\nunknown parameter at the moment in this simple model is m\u03c3B since one\nhas b = m2\u03c3B /(2F\u03c0 )2 . Then, calculating the conventional pion pion amplitude as the sum of the 4-point pion term plus the sigma exchange term\ngives the result,\nA(s, t, u) =\n\ns \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u22121\n2(m2\u03c3B \u2212 m2\u03c0 )\n[(1\n\u2212\n) \u2212 1].\nF\u03c02\nm2\u03c3B \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n4\n\nHere, s, t, u are the Mandelstam variables and we have included the effect\nof the small pion mass by adding a term linear in the field \u03c3 to Eq. (1).\nThe last entry \"-1\" in this equation represents the 4 point pion term.\nNear threshold (s = 4m2\u03c0 ) and for m2\u03c3B large compared to m2\u03c0 , most of this\nis seen to be canceled away and one is left with Weinberg's formula 9 for\nnear threshold scattering,\n\nA(s, t, u) =\n\n2\n(s \u2212 m2\u03c0 ),\nF\u03c02\n\n(5)\n\nwhich works very well. The inelegant feature of the present derivation is\nthat it arises as the near cancellation between two large quantities. This\ncan be cured by \"integrating out\" the relatively heavy sigma (as was done\nfor a different reason already by Gell Mann and Levy). Then the pion field\nappears non-linearly; this non-linear sigma model treats the interaction\nstrength as properly \"small\" and is convenient to use for further calculations\n(Chiral perturbation theory program). However, we shall use the original\nlinear model here since our purpose is to provide a simple toy model to\nillustrate how to parameterize the effects of the sigma meson. From the\nabove we can already draw the lesson that a simple pole term for the sigma\nwithout the associated 4 pion contact term is likely to be misleading. Both\nare needed for the chiral symmetry to hold.\nIt is amusing that the SU(2) linear sigma model is identical to the Higgs\nsector of the standard electroweak theory when one scales up F\u03c0 by a factor\nof about 2660. The sigma becomes the Higgs particle and the pions become\nthe longitudinal components of the W and Z bosons. Our present understanding of \"precision\" electroweak theory suggests that the quantity m\u03c3B\nscales up by a slightly reduced factor so that the dimensionless quantity b\n(which measures the strength of the Higgs self coupling) is smaller than for\nthe possible low energy QCD application.\n\n3.

In addition,\nat the point s = m2\u03c3B , the amplitude Eq. (6) diverges. The solution to this\nproblem, which is adopted in the conventional isobar rescattering parameterizations, is to include a phenomenological width term in the denominator\nby making the replacement:\n1\n\u2212s\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nm2\u03c3B\n\n1\n.\n\u2212 s \u2212 im\u03c3B \u0393\n\n(9)\n\nHowever this standard approach is not a good idea in the present case.\nAs emphasized by Achasov and Shestakov 10 , the replacement Eq. (9)\ncompletely destroys the good threshold result which is a consequence of\nchiral symmetry. This is readily understandable since the threshold result\nwas seen to arise from a nearly complete cancellation between the first and\nsecond terms of Eq. (6). However, the pole in the linear sigma model can be\nsuccessfully handled by using, instead of Eq. (9), K-matrix regularization,\nwhich instructs us to adopt the exactly unitary form\n\u0002 \u0003\n1 + i T00 tree (s)\n0\n(10)\nS0 (s) =\n1 \u2212 i [T00 ]tree (s)\nUsing Eq.

Elsewhere it provides a unitarization of the theory which is seen to\nhave the general structure of a \"bubble-sum\". We will adopt this amplitude\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n6\n\nas our toy model for (the strongly coupled) QCD in the low energy I=J=0\nchannel.\nThe obvious question is whether this toy model can explain the experimental data. The only parameter available is m\u03c3B . In Fig. 2 the real\npart of the T00 amplitude (sufficient in the elastic regime) is plotted against\nexisting data for several values of m\u03c3B . It is seen that there is at least a\nrough fit to the data up till about 0.8 GeV if m\u03c3B lies in the range 0.8\n- 1.0 GeV. Clearly, the energy region between about 0.8 and 1.2 GeV is\nnot at all fit by the model. However this is due to the neglect of a second\nscalar resonance which is expected to exist in low energy QCD. As shown\nin 11 if the SU(2) Lagrangian is \"upgraded\" to the three-flavor case (so that\nanother scalar field \u03c3 \u2032 identifiable with the f0 (980) is contained) the entire\n\u221a\nregion up to about s = 1.2 GeV can be reasonably fit with the same K\nmatrix unitarization scheme.\nIn assessing the validity of this toy model for low energy QCD one should\nalso consider the role of the vector mesons. These are known to be important in many low energy processes and give the dominant contributions\nto the \"low energy constants\" of the chiral perturbation theory expansion.\nNevertheless it was found 12 that, while rho meson exchange does make a\ncontribution to low energy s-wave pion pion scattering, its inclusion does\nnot qualitatively change the properties of the light \u03c3 resonance which seems\ncrucial to explain the I=J=0 partial wave. More specifically, the effect of\nthe rho meson raises the \u03c3 mass by about 100 MeV and lowers its width\nsomewhat.\nThus, we have seen that the given toy model provides a reasonable description of low energy s-wave pion pion scattering. At the same time we\nhave seen a couple of its drawbacks and how to improve them. Before going\nto the rescattering application, it seems worthwhile to mention an interesting feature of the K-matrix unitarization. The criterion for the model to be\nin the non-perturbative region is that the dimensionless coupling constant\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u03c3B\nis greater than unity. Here b is around 10. Thus one might\nb= m\n2F\u03c0\nexpect the physical parameters like the sigma mass and width to differ\nfrom their \"bare\" or tree-level values. To study this we look at the complex\nsigma pole position in the partial wave amplitude in Eqs. (11) and (7):\n\nT00 (s) =\n\n(m2\u03c3B \u2212 s)\u03b1(s) + \u03b2(s)\n.\n(m2\u03c3B \u2212 s)[1 \u2212 i\u03b1(s)] \u2212 i\u03b2(s)\n\n(12)\n\nThis is regarded as a function of the complex variable z which agrees with\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n7\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nR00\n\n0.2\n\n5.5511e\u221217\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\n0.26\n\n0.46\n\n0.66\n\n0.86\ns\n\n1.06\n\n1.26\n\nFigure 2.

The pole position z0 is then given as the solution\nof:\n(m2\u03c3B \u2212 z0 )[1 \u2212 i\u03b1(z0 )] \u2212 i\u03b2(z0 ) = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nNote that \u03b1(s) remains finite as q 2 = s\u22124m2\u03c0 \u2192 0, so there\np are no poles due\nto the numerator of Eq. (12). In Fig. 3 we show how Re(z0 ), a measure\nof the \"physical\" sigma mass, depends on the choice of m\u03c3B . Note that\nthere is a maximum physical mass and correspondingly two different values\nof m\u03c3B will result in the same physical mass. In fact, the best fit value lies\na bit to the right of the peak; there the physical mass is considerably less\nthan the bare mass. Similarly, the physical width comes out considerably\nsmaller than the bare width.\nIt is amusing to observe that the peak of |T00 (s)| occurs at the bare\nsigma mass, s = m2\u03c3B . This may be seen by noting that, since T00 (s) can be\nexpressed in terms of the phase shift as exp(i\u03b400 (s)) sin \u03b400 (s), the peak will\noccur where |\u03b400 (s)| = \u03c0/2. In other words, the peak will occur where T00 (s)\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n8\n\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.\nm\u03c0 = 0.\n\nPlot of\n\np\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nRe(z0 ) in GeV as a function of m\u03c3B in GeV.

It should also be remarked that the shape of |T00 (s)| differs\nconsiderably from a corresponding Breit-Wigner shape for the parameter\nchoice which fits the s-wave pion pion scattering data.\n4. Rescattering\nWe have argued against using for the rescattering term representing the\nsigma in Fig. 1, the usual choice:\ng\u03c3\u03c0\u03c0\n,\nm2\u03c3B \u2212 s \u2212 im\u03c3B \u0393\n\n(14)\n\nwhere g\u03c3\u03c0\u03c0 is the sigma pi pi coupling constant in the model (which will\nanyway get absorbed in an unspecified \"production\" factor). In the Kmatrix unitarization we do not introduce the width by hand. Rather the\nrescattering is represented by the \"bubble sum\" factor (1 \u2212 i[T00 ]tree )\u22121 as\n\n\fDecember 16, 2018\n\n12:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nrescatteringtalk\n\n9\n\nin Eq. (11). Then, the proper rescattering factor\n\n10\n\nis,\n\ng\u03c3\u03c0\u03c0\n1\ng\u03c3\u03c0\u03c0\n= 2\ncos \u03b400 exp i\u03b400 ,\n2\n0\nm\u03c3B \u2212 s 1 \u2212 i[T0 ]tree\nm\u03c3B \u2212 s\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we used the relation for the phase shift \u03b400 in the K-matrix unitarization scheme: tan \u03b400 = [T00 ]tree , where in turn the unitarized I=J=0 S-matrix\nelement is given by S00 = exp 2i\u03b400 . It is important to examine the quantity\ncos \u03b400 (s). Using Eq. (6) it is straightforward to find\ncos \u03b400 (s) =\n\n[(m2\u03c3B\n\n\u2212\n\ns)2\n\nm2\u03c3B \u2212 s\n.\n+ (\u03b1(s)(m2\u03c3B \u2212 s) + \u03b2(s))2 ]1/2\n\n(16)\n\nThe numerator cancels the pole at s = m2\u03c3B in Eq. (15) so one has a finite\nresult for the rescattering factor expressed in terms of the functions \u03b1(s) and\n\u03b2(s) defined in Eq.(7). In contrast to |T00 |, the magnitude of the rescattering\n0\nfactor | cos \u03b400 ei\u03b40 /(m2\u03c3B \u2212s)| peaks at the much smaller physical value rather\nthan the bare value of the sigma mass 14 . This is understandable since there\nis a trivial numerator and the denominator has the same structure as the\ndenominator used to find the physical pole position.\nTo sum up, we have stressed that it is necessary to take chiral symmetry\ninto account when parameterizing the final state rescattering into two pions\nin the I=J=0 channel. We presented a simple toy model 15 which seems\nable to do the job. In this model the quantity m\u03c3B may be considered a\nparameter. Evidently there is a lot more to do in this area and hopefully the\npossibility of improving our understanding of low energy strong dynamics\nwill emerge.\nAcknowledgments\nThis talk is mainly based on reinterpreting 14 which deals with production\nof longitudinal electroweak gauge bosons by the \"gluon fusion\" mechanism.\nMore complete referencing is included there.

We argued that the sigma meson is likely to be an exotic resonance with\na four quark structure, which does not appear as a pole at leading order in\nthe 1/Nc approximation. However, in the linear sigma model it is the chiral\npartner of the pion and hence presumably a p wave quark antiquark state.\nAs far as the 1/Nc expansion is concerned, it should then appear at leading\norder. We can explain this feature by saying that the bare sigma in the model\nis heavy and as such not apparently relevant for dynamics below 1 GeV. However, the unitarization, which has the effect of emphasizing the two meson (or\nfour quark) component, is a sub leading large Nc feature which is important\nin lowering the bare sigma mass in our world of Nc =3. In addition there\nis another effect which seems to push in the same direction. It has been argued that in the linear sigma model approach it is better to start with two\nchiral fields- one representing bare two quark states and the other bare four\nquark states. The low lying scalars in this picture tend to have relatively large\nfour quark components. See section V of 11 above, M. Napsuciale and S. Rodriguez, arXiv:hep-ph/0407037 and A. H. Fariborz, R.
