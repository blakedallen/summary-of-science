It is obtained by removing\nthe mass parameter from the function of the radial coordinate and introducing\na dimensionless parameter in the function of the angle coordinate in the metric\nfunctions. It turns out that it is in fact the massless limit of the Kerr - NUT\nsolution.\n\nPACS numbers: 04.20.-q,95.30\nThe axially symmetric stationary spacetime hosts the most interesting two parameter\nKerr family of vacuum black hole solution of the Einstein equation. It is well known that\nthe family is unique under the assumptions of asymptotic flatness and of existence of regular smooth horizon. The Kerr solution has turned out to be the most interesting solution\nof the Einstein equation for the astrophysical applications, particularly in the context of\nhigh energy sources like quasars, pulsars, gamma ray bursters and active galactic nuclei.\nThe two parameters in the solution represent mass and specific angular momentum of\nthe hole. When rotation is switched off, the solution reduces to the static Schwarzschild\nblack hole. In the limit of vanishing mass it reduces to flat space. That is, the rotation by\nitself cannot be a source of gravity. This is however quite understandable in the Newtonian\nframework. The question is, should that always be the case in general relativity as well? In\nthis paper, we wish to address this question and would like to present a solution in which\nmass parameter is replaced by a dimensionless parameter appropriately. The solution so\nobtained would in a particular sense be \"dual\" to the Kerr solution.\nThe form of the axially symmetric stationary metric we choose is motivated by the\nphysical considerations of separability of the Hamilton - Jacobi equation for particle motion and the Klein - Gordon equation. That is, we seek the solution of the Einstein\nvacuum equation in the metric form in which these equations characterizing the physical\nfeatures of the solution are solvable. For this, we follow the method employed by one of\n\u2217\n\nPermanent address: Institute of Nuclear Physics,\nE-mail: zafar@suninp.tashkent.su\n\u2020\nE-mail: nkd@iucaa.ernet.in\n\n1\n\nUlugbek,\n\nTashkent\n\n702132,\n\nUzbekistan.\n\n\fus (ZT) [1]. This would determine the form and character of the certain metric functions,\na priori, and the metric is written in the following form [1],\nds2 = \u039b(dt + a\n\n2\n(F \u2212 U 2 )V 2 \u2212 (G \u2212 V 2 )U 2\ndS 2\n2\n\u22121\n2\n2 2 dr\nd\u03c6)\n\u2212\n\u039b\n[(U\n\u2212\na\nV\n)(\n+\n) + U 2 V 2 d\u03c62 ]\nU 2 \u2212 a2 V 2\nU2\nV2\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u039b=\n\nU 2 \u2212 a2 V 2\n,\nF \u2212 a2 G\n\nF = r 2 + a2 , G = 1 \u2212 S 2 .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nFurther we have U = U(r), V = V (S) where S is an angle coordinate and a is a\nconstant having the dimension of length.\nNow the Kerr solution is specified by\nF \u2212 U 2 = 2Mr, G \u2212 V 2 = 0\n\n(4)\n\nwith M and a having the usual meaning of mass and specific angular momentum of the\nrotating black hole. On the other hand, the specification\nF \u2212 U 2 = 0, G \u2212 V 2 = \u22122NS\n\n(5)\n\nalso gives a vacuum solution and where the new parameter N is dimensionless. This\ncharacterization is a kind of \"dual\". In the former the radial part F \u2212 U 2 , which is\ndimensionful, is specified through the dimensionful mass parameter and the angle part\nG\u2212V 2 is vacuous while in the latter the radial part is vacuous and the angle part, which is\ndimensionless, is specified through a dimensionless parameter N. In this sense the above\ntwo characterizing relations are \"dual\" to each-other, and so should be the spacetimes\nthey specify.\nClearly, it is this form of the metric which has suggested us the duality relation leading\nto the dual solution. It is an example of pure gravomagnetic spacetime because the\nprimary source of the field is introduced through the angle function in eqn. (4). Note\nthat what is the radial coordinate to gravoelectric and so is the angle coordinate to\ngravomagnetic spacetime. The axially symmetric vacuum spacetime metric in the proper\n(separability of H-J and K-G equations) form (1) is characterized by the two functions\nU(r) and V (S). The mass parameter enters through the radial function U while the\ndimensionless parameter through the angular function V .\nFurther, the dual character of the parameters M and N will become clearly visible in\nthe expressions for the curvature components. For instance, let us write one particular\ncomponent, say RrS rS for the metric (1) explicitly,\nRrS rS =\n\nMr(r 2 \u2212 3a2 S 2 )\n(r 2 + a2 S 2 )3\n\n(6)\n\nfor the Kerr solution specified by eqn. (3). This component would go over to the one\nfor the specification of the dual solution (4) by the transformation, M \u2192 \u2212aN, r \u2194 aS.\nThis is a true dual transformation which takes the Kerr solution to the dual solution;i.e.\n2\n\n\fRiemann(Kerr) \u2192 Riemann(Dual). Under this transformation, the functions of r and S\ninterchange their roles, (F \u2212 U 2 ) \u2194 a2 (G \u2212 V 2 ). Then eqns (3) and (4) are clearly the\ndual of each-other and so are the spacetimes described by them.\nFor the dual solution, the metric would take the explicit form,\nr 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 a2 N 2 sin2 \u03b8\n2aNS(r 2 + a2 )\n(dt\n+\nd\u03c6)2\nr 2 + a2 S 2\nr 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 a2 N 2 sin2 \u03b8\ndr 2\n(1 + N 2 )(r 2 + a2 )(r 2 + a2 S 2 ) sin2 \u03b8 2\n2\n2 2\nd\u03c6\n\u2212\n(r\n+\na\nS\n)(\n+ d\u03b82 )\n\u2212\nr 2 + a2\nr 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 a2 N 2 sin2 \u03b8\n\nds2 =\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have written S = N + (1 + N 2 )1/2 cos \u03b8.\nIt reduces to flat space when N = 0 or a = 0. The spacetime is asymptotically non\nflat. It turns out that it is in fact the Kerr - NUT solution [2] with M = 0. That is, it is\nthe massless limit of the Kerr - NUT solution. By writing l = aN, a2 = b2 \u2212 l2 (and then\nreplacing b by a) and redefining the coordinates t and \u03c6 appropriately, the above metric\ncan be transformed to the Kerr - NUT form,\nA\nB\n[dt \u2212 (a sin2 \u03b8 \u2212 2l cos \u03b8)d\u03c6]2 \u2212 dr 2\nB\nA\nsin2 \u03b8 2\n[(r + a2 + l2 )d\u03c6 \u2212 adt]2 \u2212 Bd\u03b82\n\u2212\nB\n\nds2 =\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nA = r 2 + a2 \u2212 l2 , B = r 2 + (l + a cos \u03b8)2 .\n\n(9)\n\nThis is the Kerr - NUT solution [2] with M = 0 and l being the NUT parameter.\nThe massless limit of the Kerr - NUT solution and the Kerr solution are thus dual of\neach-other. The NUT solution [3-7] is the prime example of the gravomagnetic field, in\nparticular it can be interpreted as the field of a grvomagnetic monopole charge [4]. In\nour solution, though M = 0, yet the Kerr and NUT parameters do contribute an effective\ngravitational mass (l2 \u2212 a2 )/r. This follows from writing A/r 2 = 1 + 2\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the\nNewtonian potential. The effective mass would be positive or negative depending upon\nl2 \u2277 a2 and consequently the field would be attractive or repulsive. That is, the NUT\nparameter produces attractive field while the Kerr parameter, as is well - known, produces\nrepulsive.\nThe maim aim of this exercise was to expose this interesting duality relation between\nthe two exact vacuum solutions. This duality is however different from the elctrogravity\nduality considered in Refs. [8,9]. The latter referred to duality between active and passive\nelectric parts of the Riemann curvature, which was also the symmetry of the vacuum\nequation. Here we are instead referring to duality in the prescription of the radial and\nangular functions in the metric.\nAcknowledgment: We wish to thank our young colleague Parampreet Singh for helping us in verifying the solution.
