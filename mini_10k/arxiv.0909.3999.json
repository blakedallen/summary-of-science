The introduction of a\nposition dependent bulk mass allows for a well defined Kaluza-Klein expansion for bulk fermions.\nThe realization of flavor and the contribution to electroweak precision observables are shown to be\nvery similar to the hard wall case. The bounds from electroweak precision test are however milder\nwith gauge boson Kaluza-Klein modes as light as \u223c 1.5 TeV compatible with current experimental\nbounds.\n\n1\n\n\fModels with warped extra dimensions offer a new approach to solve the hierarchy problem,\nexplaining the stability of the electroweak scale against the ultraviolet physics simply due\nto the geometry of space-time in these models. They also have a very appealing flavor\nstructure, as they naturally predict hierarchical fermion masses with an extra built-in flavor\nprotection for light fermions. Hard wall models [1], based on a slice of AdS5 , are compatible\nwith current constraints and a natural realization of flavor for masses of the gauge boson\nKaluza-Klein (KK) modes heavier than mKK \u2265 3.5 TeV [2] (see [3] for a recent review). Soft\nwall models, which modify infrared (IR) physics by removing the IR brane and changing the\ngravitational background, have been shown to be compatible with current data for much\nlighter gauge boson KK modes mKK \u2265 0.5 TeV [4] when fermions are constrained to live on\nthe UV brane. In this talk we discuss how to incorporate bulk fermions in the picture and\nthe impact they have on constraint on the model from electroweak precision tests (EWPT)\nand flavor physics. More details can be found in [5] (see also [6] for other approaches to bulk\nfermions in soft wall models).\nThe soft wall is realized on an AdS5 background\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = a2 (z) dx2 \u2212 dz 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the warp factor is a(z) = L0 /z and L0 corresponds to the inverse curvature scale of the\nAdS5 space (and gives the location of the UV brane on the extra dimension L0 \u2264 z \u2264 \u221e).\nThe departure from pure AdS is given by a dilaton with profile \u03a6 = (z/L1 )2 , so that the\n\nmatter action reads\nSmatter =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd5 x ge\u2212\u03a6 Lmatter .\n\n(2)\n\nL1 is the scale at which the background begins to depart from pure AdS. The expected\nvalues of these scales for a natural theory of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) are\n\u22121\nL\u22121\n0 \u223c MPl and L1 \u223c TeV.\n\nLet us now consider bulk fermions in this background. The action of a bulk fermion,\n\u03a8(x, z), reads\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\na\u2032 1 \u2032\n5\n4 \u2212\u03a6\n5\nS = d x a e \u03a8\u0304 i\u2713\n\u2202 + \u22025 + 2 \u2212 \u03a6 \u03b3 \u2212 aM \u03a8 = d5 x \u03c8\u0304 i\u2713\n\u2202 +\u22025 \u03b3 5 \u2212aM \u03c8, (3)\na\n2\nwhere in the second equation we have defined\n\u03c8(x, z) \u2261 a2 (z)e\u2212\u03a6(z)/2 \u03a8(x, z).\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fIn order to obtain a sensible KK expansion of this bulk fermion with the required features,\nwe postulate a z-dependent bulk Dirac mass of the form\nM(z) =\n\nc0\nc1 z 2\n,\n+\nL0 L0 L21\n\n(5)\n\nwhere c0,1 are dimensionless constants expected to be order one.

It is easy to see (details can be found in [5]) the qualitative and quantitative\nequivalence of bc\n[\u00b1, \u00b1]hardwall \u21d4 [\u00b1, sign(c1 )]softwall .\n\n(15)\n\nHere [\u00b1, \u00b1] denote the bc at the UV and IR brane, respectively, where a + (\u2212) means\nthat the RH (LH) chirality has Dirichlet bc (it vanishes) at the corresponding brane. For\ninstance, in the hard wall we have a LH (RH) chiral zero mode for [++] ([\u2212\u2212]) bc. Similaly,\nin the soft wall we find the following zero modes\n0\nL1\u22132c\n0\nf0L,R (c0 , c1 ; z) =\nE\u00b1c0 + 1\n2\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nwhere E\u03bd (z) =\n\nR\u221e\n1\n\n\u0012\n\nL2\n\u00b1c1 20\nL1\n\n\u0013\u0015\u2212 12\n\nz\n\n\u2213c0 \u2213\n\ne\n\nc1 z 2\n2L2\n1\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\ndt e\u2212zt/t\u03bd is the Exponential Integral E function. A LH zero mode exists\n\nif c1 > 0 and the UV bc is [+], whereas a RH zero mode exists if c1 < 0 and the UV bc is\n[\u2212], just as in the hard wall. Once the right boundary conditions for the existence of a chiral\nzero mode are imposed, we see that c1 controls the exponential die-off in the IR whereas c0\ncontrols the localization of the zero mode. The same equivalence also occurs at the level of\nmassive modes.\nThis KK expansion can be now used to study the phenomenology of bulk fermions in soft\nwall models. The most important features from the phenomenological point of view are the\nmasses and couplings of the bulk fermions to the Higgs and gauge bosons. The masses scale\naccording to Regge trajectories, as governed by the soft wall\n\u221a\nn\n.\nmn \u223c\nL1\n\n(17)\n\nThis means that the spectrum of new massive fermions is more packed, with more modes\naccessible at colliders and more modes giving indirect contributions to EWPT at loop level.\nIndeed, a detailed calculation of the two most relevant observables, the T parameter and the\nZbL b\u0304L coupling, using the results in [7] shows that up to \u223c 10 modes can contribute before\nthe results stabilize [5]. Regarding the couplings, both gauge and Yukawa couplings share\nthe main features that make hard wall models so appealing. Gauge couplings to gauge boson\nKK modes are almost universal for UV localized fermions with departures from universality\n4\n\n\fproportional to the fermion masses. This guarantees a flavor protection mechanism similar\nto the one that makes hard wall models compatible with flavor data and a low scale of new\nphysics with minimal tuning or structure. Similarly, Yukawa couplings naturally predict\nhierarchical masses and mixing angles so again the realization of flavor is as natural in soft\nwall models as it is with a hard wall.\nWe have performed a detailed fit to all relevant electroweak precision observables, including the one loop contribution from the top sector to the T parameter and the ZbL b\u0304L\ncoupling. We performed the one loop calculations for these observables treating the EWSB\nperturbatively. We also checked the validity of this approximation, and even by including a\nsmall number of KK modes the perturbative treatment of EWSB is a good approximation\nup to per mille level. The result is that minimal models with a custodial protection of these\ntwo observables [8, 9] are compatible with EWPT provided the gauge boson KK modes are\nheavier than\nmGB\nn & 1.5 \u2212 3 TeV,\n\n(18)\n\ndepending on the details of the Higgs boson [5]. Less minimal models or different backgrounds may allow even lighter KK modes. This milder constraint and the fact that masses\n\u221a\nscale with n makes the LHC prospects of discovering these models very exciting.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been partially supported by SNSF under contract 200021-117873, MICINN\nunder the RyC program and project FPA2006-05294 and Junta de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a projects FQM\n101, FQM 437 and FQM03048.\n\n[1] L.
