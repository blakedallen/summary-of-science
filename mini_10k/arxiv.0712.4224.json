The coevolutionary dynamics in finite populations currently is investigated in a wide range of\ndisciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution, social and economic systems. The dynamics of those\nsystems can be formulated within the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not\na priori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are not infinitely large.\nWhereas the replicator equation approach describes the infinite population size limit by deterministic\ndifferential equations, in finite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new\neffects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for\nfrequency-dependent selection in finite populations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts\nbetween two populations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was demonstrated,\ndepending on the underlying microscopic process of the evolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears\nwidely in biological coevolution, be it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as female and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift is calculated for the\nfrequency-dependent Moran process and for different pairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown\nthat the drift reversal cannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of individuals.\nFurther, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not lead to a drift towards the internal fixed\npoint. Hence the nonlinear comparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with\nits usage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of the mechanism.\nPACS. 87.23.-n Ecology and Evolution \u2013 89.65.-s Social and economic systems\n\nIntroduction\nBiology offers a rich laboratory of various types of oscillatory, chaotic and stochastic dynamics. Recently cyclic\nevolutionary dynamics has been observed in E.coli in vitro\n[1] and in vivo [2], and attracted interest as a possible\nmechanism to stabilize biodiversity. This contributes to a\nlong-standing debate how the emergence of new mutants\nis maintained in biological evolution: Cyclic dynamics has\nbeen one of the first proposals for such mechanisms [3].\nCyclic coevolution is not only observed in asexual reproduction. A prominent observation of cyclic domination is\nobserved in side-blotched lizards [4,5]. Three territorial\nmating behaviour strategies of the male lizards occur, and\ncoincide genetically with orange, blue and yellow blotches.\nWhile the cyclic dynamics of rock-paper-scissors type can\nbe demonstrated without taking males and females into\naccount explicitely, hereby an improved quantitative understanding is possible [6].\nSocial and economic systems are a likewise interesting\nclass of systems in which cyclic dynamics is observed. Social individua deciding in economic situations [7,8,9,10,\n11,12,13] can fall into oscillatory cycles, e.g. when loners,\n\nnot participating in the game, are added as a third strategy to a Prisoner's Dilemma [14,15]. Evolutionary game\ntheory is a unifying approach for such systems [16,17,18].\nIn this paper, a paradigmatic cyclic game is analyzed,\nwhich is of likewise importance, for biological mating behaviour, as well as in human social decision dynamics:\nDawkins' \"Battle of the Sexes\" (BOTS), a 2\u00d72 bimatrix\ngame, is the simplest possible type of a cyclic game played\nby individuals between two homogeneous, mixed populations [19]. In the mating behaviour of females and males, a\ncyclical dominance of 'slow' and 'fast' strategies can lead\nto a \"Battle of the Sexes\", or oscillations, in the infinite\npopulation replicator dynamics [19,20,21]. The inherent\nstochasticity in a finite population [22,23,24] refines this\npicture, depending on population size and underlying process [25,26,27,28,29,30].\nThe aim of the paper is to investigate in detail the\ndrift reversal firstly reported in [25], and to corrobate the\nsimulations with an analytic result, allowing for a refined\ninsight into the drift reversal. The main results are (i)\nthat for a generic class of pairwise comparison processes a\ndrift reversal does not occur, and (ii) that for the Moran\n\n\f2\n\nJens Christian Claussen: Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts\n\nprocess, the combination of both a nonlinear reproductive\nfitness and the comparison with a global function (average\nfitness) are necessary for a drift reversal.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, the\nBOTS payoff matrices are introduced and the infinite population description of evolutionary game theory by the\nreplicator equation is recalled. In Section 2, evolutionary\nbirth-death processes are defined in a unifying framework\nfor comparison. In Section 3 the influence of the stochasticity on the time evolution of the population densities is\nmotivated by computer simulations of the process.\nIn the main Section 4, the average drift (more formally\nintroduced in Sect. 4.1) of the BOTS dynamics is calculated explicitely in finite populations, and the population\nsize corrections are obtained to first and second order analytically for four microscopic interaction processes, for\nneutral evolution as well as for two linear processes, the\nLocal Update and the linearized Moran process. The paper concludes by discussing and summarizing the results.\n\n1 Battle of the Sexes: Replicator dynamics\n\n~\u0013\n\n\u03c0A\n~\n\u03c0B\n\n\u0012\n\n|\n\u03c0A\n|\n\u03c0B\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121 +1\n+1 \u22121\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nx\n1\u2212x\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n+1 \u22121\n\u22121 +1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ny\n1\u2212y\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nfor agents interacting with a population of (x, y, 1\u2212x, 1\u2212y)\n= (i/N, j/N, (N \u2212 i)/N, (N \u2212 j)/N ) agents in the strate~\n~\n|\n|\n, \u03c0B ). As the opponent's payoff matrix is\ngies (\u03c0A\n, \u03c0A , \u03c0B\nnot the simple transpose of the proponent's payoff matrix,\nsuch games are called bimatrix games or asymmetric conflicts. While in the replicator equations [20] picture the\npopulation cannot go extinct due do lack of discreteness,\nfor the stochastic description in this paper the population\nsize will be fixed to N female and N male individuals.\nFor the relative frequencies, or abundance densities,\nevolutionary game theory, with the implicit assumption of\nan infinite population, considers the replicator equation\nA\n\u1e8b = x(\u03c0|\n\u2212 h\u03c0| i)\n\n\u1e8f =\n\nA\ny(\u03c0~\n\n\u2212 h\u03c0~ i)\n\n\u1e8f =\n\nA\nx(\u03c0|\n\u2212 h\u03c0| i)\n1\u2212w\nw + h\u03c0| i\nA\ny(\u03c0~\n\u2212 h\u03c0~ i)\n1\u2212w\nw\n\n+ h\u03c0~ i\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nare different, as h\u03c0| i = \u2212h\u03c0~ i. Thus the denominators\ncannot be absorbed into a dynamical rescale of time (velocity transformation) and both types of replicator equations not necessarily exhibit the same stability properties.\nHow is this behaviour changed, and how far is it preserved in finite populations? This is the central question\naddressed in this paper.\n\nTo study dynamics in finite populations, it is advised to go\ndown to the microscopic interactions, and to derive macroscopic equations of motion herefrom, eventually utilizing\na finite-size expansion to derive fluctuation corrections to\nthe deterministic limit. As the microscopic dynamics may\ndepend on the system at hand, the respective biological\nor behavioral setup may require different interaction and\ncompetition processes. These, however, can be cast into a\nunifying framework. Following previous investigations [7,\n25], we consider two classes of birth-death processes: the\nfrequency-dependent Moran process [22,23,24] describing\ncompetition with the whole population, and local twoparticle interaction processes, with linear [25] or Fermitype [15,31,32] dependence of the reproductive fitness as\na function of the payoff difference between two competing\nagents. For all processes, the payoffs for an individual read\n~\n\n|\n\u03c0A\n= 2y \u2212 1\n\n\u03c0A = 1 \u2212 2x\n\n|\n\u03c0B\n= 1 \u2212 2y\n\n\u03c0B = 2x \u2212 1.\n\n~\n\n(8)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nFor the standard parameter choice (equivalent to \"Matching Pennies\") of the BOTS the replicator equation has a\nconstant of motion\nH = \u2212x(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 y).\n\n\u1e8b =\n\n2 Evolutionary processes\n\nThis is the simplest cyclic game between two populations.\nFollowing Dawkins [19], the elementary payoffs read\n\u0012\n\nwhere members of the two (sub)populations can receive\ndifferent payoffs, both populations may gain different average payoffs, and the denominators in the adjusted replicator equations (being the proper N \u2192 \u221e limit of the\nMoran process, see [27])\n\n(5)\n\nThe replicator equations exhibits neutrally stable oscillations around the x = y = 1/2 fixed point; the adjusted\nreplicator equation (see [20]) has an attractive stable fixed\npoint.

In the\nfrequency-dependent Moran process [23,24], each individual competes with the whole population, or an representative fraction of it, and reproduces proportional to this\n(cumulative) payoff normalized by the average payoff in\n\n\fJens Christian Claussen: Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts\n0.9\n\nthe population.

Therefore, it is\nadvised to consider a local competition among individuals.\nOne process of this type is the Local update process [25],\nwhere one individual b is selected randomly for reproduction, compares with another randomly chosen individual\na, and changes strategy with probability 21 (1+w(\u03c0a \u2212\u03c0b )).\nThe frequency-dependent Moran process (MO), and\nthe other processes below (LU = local update [25], FP =\nFermi process [32], and a linearized Moran process (LM)\nconsidered below) can more conveniently be written by\nmeans of a reproductive function\n1 1 \u2212 w + w\u03c0a\n2 1 \u2212 w + wh\u03c0i\n1\n\u03a6LM (\u03c0a , h\u03c0i, w) = (1 + w(\u03c0a \u2212 h\u03c0i))\n2\n1\n\u03a6LU (\u03c0a , \u03c0b , w) = (1 + w(\u03c0a \u2212 \u03c0b ))\n2\n1\n\u03a6FP (\u03c0a , \u03c0b , w) =\n1 + exp(\u2212w(\u03c0a \u2212 \u03c0b ))\n\n\u03a6MO (\u03c0a , h\u03c0i, w) =\n\nNa Nb\nN N\nNa Nb\nN N\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFig. 1.

Due to the\nlack of helical paper, only one period of oscillation is shown.\nOne can observe that for the large population (N = 10000) the\ntrajectory spirals inwards towards the fixed point at ( 12 , 12 ).\n\nfor the other processes (MO,LM) where an individual's\npayoff is compared to the payoff averaged over the whole\npopulation.\nFor all processes, \u03a6 considers a two-particle (birthdeath) process where an individual with fitness \u03c0a compares (Eqs. 11\u201312) with a representative sample of the\npopulation (i.e. the average fitness h\u03c0i), or (Eqs. 13\u201314)\nwith another individual \u03c0b . The frequency-dependent Moran\nprocess [22,23], the Local Update [25], and the Fermi process [32] are microscopic evolutionary processes discussed\nrecently. The Linearized Moran (LM) process arises as approximation of the Moran (MO) process in the weak selection limit w \u2192 0.\nNote, that elsewhere for the Local update w is replaced\nby w/\u2206\u03c0max , and for the Moran process, w may not exceed 1 \u2212 \u03c0min . In the above notation, in the limit w \u2192 0\nthe Fermi process approaches the Local update process.\n\n3 Stochastic motion around the fixed point\n\n(12)\n\nHaving defined different possible microscopic update processes, one desires to gain an intuitive understanding of\nthe resulting stochastic motion, in comparison of small\n(here, N = 50) and large (here, N = 10000) populations.\nFigure 1 compares the time evolution of the evolutionary\ntrajectory in phase space (x, y) and Figure 2 in the time\nevolution of H. For a large population, the qualitative dynamics of the adjusted replicator equation is recovered,\ni.e., convergence to the internal fixed point and thereby\ndecrease of H which serves as Lyapunov function in the\ndeterministic limit. The motion of the small population is\ncomparatively more stochastic, and after few generations,\nfixation to the border is reached.

Stochastic motion around the fixed point, Moran process (w = 0.5) for different population sizes (same as in Fig. 1).\nHere for the initial trajectory the value of H (Eq. 5) is shown\nas a function of time. Time is measured in generation units,\ni.e. N update steps are performed per unit time so that after\nt = 1 each agent on average is updated once. For N = 50, H\nfluctuates and also increases on average (due to stochastic motion in the plane). For N = 10000, H decays as the trajectory\napproaches the fixed point. For the corresponding deterministic system, H serves as a Lyapunov function of the stable fixed\npoint and admits the value Hfix = \u22121/16 there (straight line).\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.07\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFig. 4. Stochastic motion around the fixed point. Time evolution over five decades for the Moran process (black) and the\nLocal update process (red/gray) for a large population size\nN = 10000 (w = 0.5). For such large populations, the stochastic motion is close to the deterministic equations that follow\nin the limit N \u2192 \u221e [25]. For the Local Update, the replicator\nequation is neutrally stable at the fixed point, and H admits a\nconstant of motion. The stochastic realization shows zero drift\nin H, but fluctuates, and ultimately the process leads to fixation to the border. Also the Moran process will reach the border\nfor t \u2192 \u221e, however, after a long metastable transient. For the\nMoran process, the deterministic equation is the adjusted replicator equation which has an asymptotocally stable fixed point.\nCorrespondingly H decays describing a transient (metastable)\nattractive behaviour towards the fixed point. Note that due to\nthe attracting force, the motion keeps confined to the vicinity\nof the fixed point and fluctuations are damped.\n\ndate process performs a specific type of random walk in H\n(in the sense that the internal fixed point is of neutral stability), the Moran process first confines the motion in the\nvicinity of the attracting internal point, but due to the\ndiscreteness of the process, fixates to the border in the\nlimit t \u2192 \u221e. The initial conditions are the same as in the\nprevious figures, starting from a state different from the\nfixed point, to show that the Moran process indeed leads\nto some type of convergence to the metastable state.\n\nFig. 3. Stochastic motion around the fixed point. Moran process (w = 0.5). For small population sizes, the internal fluctuations are large compared to the size of the phase space, hence\nfixation to the border is reached quickly. Above an intermediate range (in which the process behaves similar to neutral\nstable fixed point), fixation time diverges as the N \u2192 \u221e behaviour of an asymptotically stable fixed point is recovered.\n\n4 Deterministic and stochastic equations of\nmotion at the level of the diffusion\napproximation\n\nobservation of a metastable state. Figure 3 shows a longer\ntime interval and four different population sizes.\nThis paper addresses not only the influence of the population size, but also the influence of the microscopic update process. Figure 4 demonstrates that on longer time\nscales (here, the time scale is shown on a logarithmic scale\nto show the convergence behaviour). While the Local Up-\n\nIn many cases population sizes are such small that deviations from a deterministic population density cannot be\nneglected - especially because a species or genetic trait can\ngo extinct, or likewise, a new mutant can either extinct or\nfixate (i.e., become the common trait in the whole population). If populations are not too small, e.g. N = 102 , one\nhowever can think of a perturbation expansion in orders of\n1/N to derive stochastic corrections to the deterministic\nequations of motion. A classic approach in mathematical\n\n\fJens Christian Claussen: Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts\n\ngenetics in this direction is the so-called diffusion approximation [33,34], which allows to derive fixation probabilities and densities from a Kolmogorov forward, or FokkerPlanck, equation. For a fixed population size and one trait\n(higherdimensional cases are prohibitive), the equivalence\nto a one-dimensional Markov chain allows for a closed exact expression.\nA similar framework applies for deriving the equations\nof motion in zero and first order in 1/N , and neglecting\nhigher orders; i.e., we operate at the level of the diffusion\napproximation. Such approaches have been formulated in\na wide range of fields from genetics to behavioural dynamics [7,13,25,27,30,33,35]. In the simplest setting of\ntwo strategies or traits, from the hopping rates T + , T \u2212\nwe have\n\u03c1\u0307(x, t) = \u2212\u2207(a(x)\u03c1(x, t)) + \u22072 (b2 (x)\u03c1(x, t))\n\n5 Average drift: Battle of the Sexes\nFor the replicator equation, Eq. (5) defines a constant\nof motion. As we are interested in the finite-size corrections, we can use H as an observable for the distance to\nthe interior fixed point. For the processes defined above,\nthe transition probabilities allow to calculate the average\nchange of the constant of motion within the state space\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N \u2212 1) as\nh\u2206Hi =\n\nwhere \u2207 = \u2202/\u2202x, a(x) = T + \u2212 T \u2212 and b2 (x) = (T + +\nT \u2212 )/N have to be derived for each microscopic update\nprocess and payoff matrix.\n\nThe phase space average discussed in the next section can\nbe interpreted as an approximation of the time evolution\nof an observable H, here, written for the case of two strategies only,\nZ\n\u0002\n\u1e22 \u2243 h\u2206Hi\u03c1x := dx \u03c1(x) (H(x + 1/N )\u2212H(x))T +\n\u0003\n+ (H(x \u2212 1/N )\u2212H(x))T \u2212 (18)\n\nand, for an ensemble of arbitrary initial conditions, we approximate \u03c1(x) by a constant. (Formally, one should distinguish between a continuous and a discrete phase space\naverage; within this paper \u2013 apart from constant prefactors \u2013 the functions for H and the rates T are continuous\nand differentiable.)\nIn the remainder we focus on functions H which also\nare Lyapunov functions of an internal fixed point. Then\na decrease of H can be interpreted as a motion towards\nthe fixed point, and an increase of H is interpreted as an\nescape from the fixed point. Thus we can define (omitting\nthe subscript x for the phase space average)\nZ\n\u0002\nh\u2206Hi := dx (H(x + 1/N )\u2212H(x))T +\n\u0003\n(19)\n+(H(x \u2212 1/N )\u2212H(x))T \u2212\n\nand define \"drift reversal\" as the change of sign of h\u2206Hi.\nIf a change of system parameters (N, w, payoffs), leads\nto a changing sign of h\u2206Hi, one observes the fixed point\ngradually lose its stochastic metastability. Due to this\ngradual transition, respective critical population sizes are\napproximative and could be defined in (possibly many)\ndifferent ways. The essential advantage of assessing the\nstability from a sign reversal of this average drift h\u2206Hi is\nthat it can be calculated comparatively easy, and in the\ncase of the Battle of the Sexes, even analytically.\n\nN\n\u22121 N\n\u22121 h\nX\nX\n1\nN 2 (N \u2212 1)2 i=1 j=1\n\ni(N \u2212 i)j(N \u2212 j)(T +\u2022 + T \u2212\u2022 + T \u2022+ + T \u2022\u2212 )\n\u2212(i + 1)(N \u2212 i \u2212 1)j(N \u2212 j)T +\u2022\n\u2212(i \u2212 1)(N \u2212 i + 1)j(N \u2212 j)T \u2212\u2022\n\u2212i(N \u2212 i)(j + 1)(N \u2212 j \u2212 1)T \u2022+\ni\n\u2212i(N \u2212 i)(j \u2212 1)(N \u2212 j + 1)T \u2022\u2212 )\n\n(17)\n\n4.1 Stability and drift reversal\n\n5\n\nN\n\u22121 N\n\u22121 h\nX\nX\n1\nN 2 (N \u2212 1)2 i=1 j=1\n\u0002\n\u0003\nj(N \u2212 j) (2i \u2212 N )(T +\u2022 \u2212 T \u2212\u2022 ) + (T +\u2022 + T \u2212\u2022 )\n\u0002\n\u0003i\n+i(N \u2212 i) (2j \u2212 N )(T \u2022+ \u2212 T \u2022\u2212 ) + (T \u2022+ + T \u2022\u2212 )\n\n=\n\n=\n\nN\n\u22121 N\n\u22121 h\nX\nX\nN2\n(N \u2212 1)2 i=1 j=1\n\n\u0002 2x \u2212 1 +\u2022\n\u0003\n1\ny(1 \u2212 y)\n(T \u2212 T \u2212\u2022 )+ 2 (T +\u2022 + T \u2212\u2022 )\nN\nN\n\u0002 2y \u2212 1 \u2022+\n\u0003i\n1\n\u2022\u2212\n+x(1 \u2212 x)\n(T \u2212 T )+ 2 (T \u2022+ + T \u2022\u2212 ) .\nN\nN\n(20)\nIn the continuum limit the sums are replaced by integrals,\nZ 1 Z 1 h\nh\u2206Hi =\ndx\ndy\n0\n\n0\n\n\u0002 2x \u2212 1 +\u2022\n\u0003\n1\ny(1 \u2212 y)\n(T \u2212 T \u2212\u2022 )+ 2 (T +\u2022 + T \u2212\u2022 )\nN\nN\n\u0002 2y \u2212 1 \u2022+\n\u0003i\n1\n+x(1 \u2212 x)\n(T \u2212 T \u2022\u2212 )+ 2 (T \u2022+ + T \u2022\u2212 )\nN\nN\n\n=\n\n1\nN\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndx\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u0002\ndyx(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 y)\n\n~ \u0003\n~\n|\n(2x \u2212 1)(\u03a6|\nA \u2212 \u03a6B ) + (2y \u2212 1)(\u03a6A \u2212 \u03a6B )\nZ 1\nZ 1\n\u0002\n1\ndx\ndyx(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 y)\n+ 2\nN 0\n0\n~\n~ \u0003\n|\n(\u03a6|\nA + \u03a6B + \u03a6A + \u03a6B )\n(21)\n\n\f6\n\nJens Christian Claussen: Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts\n\nFor given transition probabilities T the drift of the discrete\nprocess can be expressed exactly, and in the case of linear\nprocesses, the resulting integrals are simple polynomial\nintegrals.

But it\nis remarkable that the term in order 1/N does not contribute for the Local Update process. As this term corresponds for N \u2192 \u221e to the ordinary replicator equation,\nthis is fully consistent with H being a constant of motion.\nFor processes that depend on the payoff difference in a\nnonlinear manner, as the Fermi process, H is no longer\na constant of motion.

We also assume that this function is identical for\nthe female and male population \u2013 this is justified as those\ndifferences should be cast into the payoff matrix rather\nthan manipulating the reproductive functions.

Hence follows\n\nTheorem 1 For a pairwise-type comparison process, where\nthe difference between reproductive fitnesses \u03a6A \u2212\u03a6B is an\ninfinitely differentiable function of the payoff difference,\nthe average drift h\u2206Hi in the Battle of the Sexes (with\nthe \u00b11 payoff matrix) is independent of the strength of selection w and equal to the drift of neutral evolution (25).\nAs a corollary, there is no drift reversal for the Local\nupdate as well as for the Fermi process, confirming the\nnumerical results in [25,29].\nThe result is remarkable in one sense. Even though\na nonlinear comparison process can lead to a nonlinear\nreplicator equation \u2013 which e.g. takes the form of a tangens\nhyperbolicus of the payoff difference for the Fermi process\n[32] \u2013 the average drift remains unaffected even for strong\nselection and small populations.\n\n5.2 General nonlinear pairwise comparison processes\n5.3 Linearized Moran process\nBefore approaching the nonlinear reproductive fitness defined by the frequency-dependent Moran process, it is instructive to analyze what happens if one considers a general pairwise comparison like for instance the Fermi process (14).

This approach may be\nadvantageous in high-dimensional cases, where exact simulations of the process become costly; a phase space average of h\u2206Hi is obtained much easier, and in very high dimensional spaces one may approximate by a Monte Carlo\nintegration.\n\n(31)\n\nBoth terms cancel for a w that matches\n\n7 Conclusions\n2\n\nNc = 25/w .\n\n(32)\n\nOne should bear in mind that due to the approximation\nw \u226a 1/2 made above, equations (31) and (32) rely on\nthe weak selection limit, which is the biologically most\nrelevant case.\nAn interesting viewpoint on its own is to consider w\nas a \"bifurcation\" parameter. Conversely to a Hopf bifurcation, where an oscillation amplitude grows with the\nsquare root of a bifurcation parameter, here the effect of\nthe Moran dynamics, to stabilize the finiteness-stochastic\noscillations around the fixed point, grows quadratically\nwith the strength of selection w. Thus, for the frequencydependent Moran process in finite populations, the onset\nof the fixed-point stabilizing mechanism is a quadratic effect of weak, but increasing, selection.\n\n6 Discussion\n\nThe investigation of the different update mechanisms suggests the existence of two universality classes: one, for\nwhich the internal fixed point is neutrally stable (in the\nN \u2192 \u221e limit), and a second, for which the internal fixed\npoint is asymptotically stable (in the N \u2192 \u221e limit).\nThe Local update process as well as other (differentiable and pair-symmetric) pairwise comparison processes,\nas the Fermi process, and also a linearized Moran process,\nbelong to the first class. The Moran process belongs to\nthe second class, and one may assume that more update\nprocesses (combining average fitness and a nonlinearity)\ncould be constructed for this class; the necessary condition\nis that the internal fixed point is attractive in the N \u2192 \u221e\nlimit.\n\nCyclic coevolution in biological or social dynamics is an\ninteresting class of coevolutionary dynamics and allows in\nan examplaric way to study stability, drift and diffusion\nin finite populations. Population sizes in markets, decison\nprocesses, as well as in biological populations from bacteria to ants and to vertebrates can vary by many orders\nof magnitude, thus the influence of the population size by\nthe stochasticity in finite populations is of fundamental\nrelevance in all those disciplines.\nFor the simplest generic model of a cyclic coevolution\nin an asymmetric conflict game between two populations,\nthe \"Battle of the Sexes\", analytical results for the average drift could be obtained that support the consistent\nunderstanding how the different fixed point stability of ordinary and adjusted replicator equations translate to finite\npopulations.\nPartially the results are quite unexpected: Not only\nfor the Fermi process, but also for a quite general class of\npairwise comparison processes \u2013 even when they lead to\ndifferent replicator equations \u2013 the average drift is identical to the neutral case, and equals 1/(18N 2). The second\nsurprise is that, for the average drift, the linearized Moran\nprocess also falls into the equivalence class of the neutral\nevolution.\nBut how does the drift reversal seen numerically (and\nknown in the N \u2192 \u221e limit for the adjusted replicator\nequation) then have to be explained? Here one has to\ncalculate the average drift for the Moran case, using the\nnonlinear dependence on the average payoff to observe the\ndrift reversal. The hereby obtained average drift then can\nbe analyzed for weak selection, resulting in an estimate\nof the critical population size which delimits the stability\nregimes of ordinary and adjusted replicator equations.\nMore generally speaking, one can conclude that, to stabilize the coexistence of strategies in a large \u2013 but finite \u2013\npopulation, not only the global knowledge of the overall\nsuccess of the population \u2013 the average payoff \u2013 must be\ntaken into account, but in addition it has to determine\nthe reproductive fitness in a nonlinear manner. The (on\nprocess level) linearized Moran process, as well as neutral\nevolution or pairwise comparison, leads to quicker extinction of all but one of the four strategy pairs.\n\n\fJens Christian Claussen: Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts\n\nReferences\n1.
