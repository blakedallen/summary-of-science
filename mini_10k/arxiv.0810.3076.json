The goal is to enable easy creation and modification\nof ontologies through the web. Texts in ACE can automatically be translated into first-order logic and other languages,\nfor example OWL.

However, the\ncreation and maintenance of ontologies is difficult because a\nnumber of domain experts - most of which are not familiar\nwith formal languages - have to agree on a conceptualization of the respective domain. For that reason, it is crucial\nfor the future of the Semantic Web to provide tools that\nmake the creation of ontologies easy for everybody.\n\nFigure 1: A screenshot of the predictive editor of\nAceWiki. The fragment \"Every area is\" has already\nbeen entered and now the editor shows all possibilities to continue the sentence.\n\nAceWiki1 tackles this problem by combining semantic wikis\nwith controlled natural language. The goal of AceWiki is to\nenable ordinary people with no background in formal languages to create expressive ontologies in a collaborative and\nintuitive way without the need of installing an application.\n\nACE has been used as a natural language front-end to OWL\nwith a bidirectional mapping of ACE to OWL [2]. AceWiki\nuses this for translating ACE sentences into OWL. The same\nwork also introduces a Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 plugin called \"ACE View\"\nwhich enables to manage ontologies in ACE within the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 environment.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThere are several existing semantic wiki systems, see e.g.\n[3] for a brief survey. Unfortunately, most of those wikis do\nnot support expressive ontology languages in a general way.\nFurthermore, they are often hard to understand for people\nwho are not familiar with the technical terms.\nAttempto Controlled English (ACE)2 is the controlled natural language that is used for AceWiki. Being a subset of\nEnglish, ACE looks completely natural. Restrictions of the\nsyntax and the definition of a small set of interpretation rules\nmake it a formal language that is automatically translatable\ninto first-order logic. ACE covers a large part of natural English: singular and plural noun phrases, active and passive\nvoice, relative phrases, anaphoric references, existential and\nuniversal quantifiers, negation, and much more.\n1\n2\n\nSee [3], [4], and http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/acewiki\nSee [1] and http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch\n\nSYSTEM\n\nIn AceWiki, the ontological entities are represented by natural language words and phrases. Proper names (e.g. \"Zurich\", \"Switzerland\", \"Europe\") are interpreted as individuals, nouns (e.g. \"city\", \"country\") are interpreted as classes,\nand transitive verbs (e.g. \"borders\"), of -constructs (e.g.\n\"part of\"), and transitive adjectives (e.g. \"located-in\") are\ninterpreted as binary relations. Using those words together\nwith the predefined function words of ACE (e.g. \"a\", \"every\",\n\"if\", \"then\", \"and\", \"not\", \"is\", \"that\"), ontological statements\nare expressed as ACE sentences:\n\nAs those examples show, the formal statements are easily\nreadable and understandable by any English speaking person. In order to enable easy creation and modification of\nACE sentences, AceWiki integrates a predictive editor that\nshows step-by-step the words that are syntactically possi-\n\n\fThe reasoner is also used to infer the class memberships of\nindividuals. The results are presented in ACE again:\n\nThe same is done for class hierarchies:\n\nFigure 2: A screenshot of the web interface of\nAceWiki showing the wiki article for the class \"continent\".\n\nThis shows that not only asserted but also inferred knowledge is represented in ACE. Finally, the reasoner is also used\nto answer questions:\n\nble at a given position in the sentence. Figure 1 shows a\nscreenshot of this editor.\n\nIn general, we can say that AceWiki communicates with the\nusers on a very natural level. No knowledge about formal\nlanguages is required to deal with AceWiki.\n\nEach of the ontological entities gets its own wiki article.\nFigure 2 shows an example. Every article consist of ACE\nsentences most of which can be translated into OWL, e.g:\n\n4.\n\nACE is more expressive than OWL, and thus we can write\nstatements that go beyond the semantic expressivity of OWL\n(e.g. rule-like statements). Such statements are marked with\na red triangle (and are currently ignored by the reasoner):\n\n5.\nFurthermore, questions can be used to query the knowledge\nbase, e.g:\n\nAceWiki uses the OWL reasoner Pellet3 to perform reasoning tasks over the sentences of the wiki that are OWLcompliant. In order to ensure the consistency of the ontology, every new sentence is checked - immediately after its\ncreation - whether it would introduce a contradiction. If\nthis is the case then the sentence is not included in the ontology and displayed in red font:\n\n3\n\nhttp://pellet.owldl.com/\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAceWiki shows how ontologies can be created and modified\nin a natural way within a wiki. It demonstrates how semantic wikis using controlled natural language can be expressive\nand easy to use at the same time. Our previous evaluation\nshowed that AceWiki is indeed easy to learn.\n\n6.\nThus, ACE is an ontology language, a rule language, and a\nquery language at the same time.\n\nEVALUATION\n\nIn our previous work [3], we conducted a user experiment\nthat showed that ordinary people with no background in\nlogic and ontologies are able to deal with AceWiki. The participants - without being instructed how to interact with\nthe interface - were asked to add knowledge to AceWiki.\nAbout 80% of the created sentences were correct and sensible. Remarkably, more than 60% of those sentences were\ncomplex in the sense that they contained an implication or\na negation.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Norbert E.
