Fading is assumed to be the dominant factor affecting\nthe strength of the channels between nodes.

By proposing a decentralized on-off power\nallocation strategy, a lower bound on the achievable throughput\nis obtained for a general fading model.

It turns out\nthat for the same number of active links the centralized scheme\nachieves a much larger rate-per-link. Moreover, at large values\nof rate-per-link, it achieves a sum-rate close to log n, i.e., the\nmaximum achieved by the decentralized scheme.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn a wireless network, a number of source nodes transmit\ndata to their designated destination nodes through a shared\nwireless channel. Followed by the pioneering work of Gupta\nand Kumar [1], considerable attention has been paid to investigate how the throughput of wireless networks scales with n,\nthe number of nodes. This has been done assuming different\nnetwork topologies, traffic patterns, protocol schemes, and\nchannel models [1]\u2013[11].\nMost of the works analyzing the throughput of wireless\nnetworks consider a channel model in which the signal power\ndecays according to a distance-based attenuation law [1], [3]\u2013\n[10]. However, in a wireless environment the presence of\nobstacles and scatterers adds some randomness to the received\nsignal. This random behaviour of the channel, known as\nfading, can drastically change the scaling laws of a network\n[2], [11].\nA common characteristic of [1]\u2013[11] is their use of multihop communications, which necessitates the presence of a\ncentral unit with full knowledge of all channel conditions to\ndecide on the routing paths and the schedule of transmissions.\nFurthermore, multihop communications induces delay in the\nnetwork and excess power consumption by the relay nodes.\nIn this paper, we follow the model of [11], where fading\nis assumed to be the dominant factor affecting the strength\nof the channels between nodes. The network is limited to\n\nsingle-hop communications to avoid the complexity and other\ndrawbacks of multihop communications mentioned above. We\npropose a link activation strategy that can be implemented in a\ndecentralized fashion. The only information required at each\ntransmitter is its direct channel coefficient. Analysis of the\nproposed strategy shows that the throughput of the network\nstrongly depends on the fading channel distribution. In particular, in a Rayleigh fading channel, it achieves a throughput\nthat scales like log(n); this is larger (by a constant factor) than\nwhat is achieved in [11] by a complicated centralized scheme.\nIn most of previous works, e.g. [1]\u2013[4], [11], rate-per-links\ndecrease to zero as the number of nodes grows. However,\nit is practically appealing to have rate-per-links that remain\nconstant when n grows. In [9], it is shown that a nondecreasing\nrate per node is achievable when nodes are mobile. In this\nwork, we show that our proposed strategy is capable of\nproviding rate-per-links like \u0398(1) while keeping the order of\nthe maximum sum-rate unchanged up to a constant factor. To\nimprove the proposed scheme, we modify it by adding an\ninterference management phase to it. This new scheme should\nbe implemented in a centralized fashion.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section\nII, the network model and objective are described. We derive\na lower bound on the sum-rate in Section III. The analysis\nof the proposed method for some specific fading models is\npresented in Section IV. Finally, we address the issue of fixed\nrate-per-link in Section V and show how to improve it.\nNotation: log is the natural logarithm function; P(A) denotes the probability of event A; E(x) represents the expected value of the random variable x; \u2248 means approximate\nequality; for any functions f (n) and h(n), h(n) = o(f (n)) is\nequivalent to limn\u2192\u221e |h(n)/f (n)| = 0, h(n) = \u03c9(f (n)) is\nequivalent to limn\u2192\u221e |h(n)/f (n)| = \u221e, h(n) = \u0398(f (n)) is\nequivalent to limn\u2192\u221e |h(n)/f (n)| = c, where 0 < c < \u221e,\nand h(n) \u223c f (n) is equivalent to limn\u2192\u221e h(n)/f (n) = 1;\nan event An holds asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s) if\nP(An ) \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nII. N ETWORK M ODEL\nWe consider a wireless communication network with n pairs\nof transmitters and receivers. Each transmitter aims to send\ndata to its corresponding receiver. The transmit power of link\ni is denoted by pi and is constrained as 0 \u2264 pi \u2264 P , where\nP > 0 is the maximum allowed transmit power.\n\n\fThe channel between transmitter j and receiver i is represented by a coefficient gji . This means the received power\nfrom transmitter j at the receiver i equals gji pj . We refer\nto coefficients gii and gji (j 6= i) as direct channel and cross\nchannel coefficients, respectively. In this paper, we assume the\nchannel coefficients are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a\npdf f (x) with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 2 .\nWe consider an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nwith limited variance \u03b7 at the receiver i. The receivers are\nconventional, linear receivers, i.e., without multiuser detection.\nSince the transmissions occur simultaneously within the same\nenvironment, the signal from each transmitter acts as interference for other links. Assuming Gaussian signal transmission\nfrom all links, the distribution of the interference will be\nGaussian as well. Thus, the maximum supportable rate of link\ni is obtained as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ng\np\nii\ni\n\uf8f8 nats/channel use. (1)\nPn\nri = log \uf8ed1 +\n\u03b7 + j=1 gji pj\nj6=i\n\nThe throughput (or sum-rate) of the network is defined as\nR=\n\nn\nX\n\nri .\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nIn this paper, we use the terms throughput and sum-rate interchangeably. We desire to choose the transmission powers pi\nsuch that R is maximized. However, the problem of throughput\nmaximization is not convex and its optimum solution cannot\nbe obtained easily. Instead, one can utilize suboptimum power\nallocation schemes to obtain lower bounds on the maximum\nachievable throughput.\nMotivated by the low SINR (Signal to Interference-plusNoise Ratio) regime in which the optimum powers are either\nzero or the maximum allowed value [12], we base our discussions in this paper on on-off power allocation strategies.\nDefinition 1: A power allocation is called an on-off strategy\nif the power of link i is selected from the set {0, P }.\nIII. A L OWER B OUND\n\nON\n\nS UM -R ATE\n\nConsider the following on-off power allocation strategy.\nStrategy 1: For a threshold t, choose the transmit power of\nlink i as\n\u001a\nP ; gii > t\npi =\n.\n(3)\n0 ; gii \u2264 t\nIn this strategy, the quality of the direct channel of each\nlink determines whether that link is active or silent. If each\ntransmitter is aware of its direct channel coefficient, it can\nindividually determine its transmit power. Hence, Strategy 1\ncan be implemented in a decentralized fashion. The sum-rate\nachieved by Strategy 1 provides a lower bound to the sum-rate\nof the wireless network under consideration.\nThe performance of Strategy 1 depends on the value of the\nthreshold t; if t is very large, the quality of the selected links\nwill be very good, but the number of such links is small and\nas a result the achieved sum-rate will be small; on the other\n\nhand, if t is very small, many links are chosen, but it causes a\nlarge interference and again the sum-rate will be small. Thus,\nit is crucial to choose a proper value for t.\nLet k denote the number of links activated under Strategy\n1. Without loss of generality, we assume that the active\nlinks are indexed by 1, 2, * * * , k. From (1), (2), and (3), the\ncorresponding sum-rate is equal to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\nX\ngii\nlog 1 +\nR=\n,\n\u03c1 + Ii\ni=1\nPk\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03b7/P and Ii = j=1 gji is the interference seen by\nj6=i\n\nlink i. Considering the fact that gii > t for the selected links\nand by using the Jensen's inequality, we obtain the following\nlower bound on the sum-rate\n!\nt\nR \u2265 k log 1 +\n.\n(4)\nPk\n\u03c1 + k1 i=1 Ii\n\nTo make this lower bound more tractable, we use the Chebyshev inequality to write (4) as (see [12] for details)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\na.a.s.\n(5)\nR \u2265 k log 1 +\n\u03bck + \u03c8k\nfor any \u03c8k \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e.\nAssume the probability of a link being active is q. Due\nto Strategy 1, which selects links independently and with\nprobability q, the number of active links, k, is a binomial\nrandom variable with parameters n and q.\nLemma 1: If k is a binomial random variable with parameters n and q, then for any \u03ben \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e we have\n\u221a\na.a.s.\n|k \u2212 nq| < \u03ben nq\nProof: See [12].\nNow, we are ready to prove the main result of this section,\nwhich is an achievability result on the sum-rate.\nTheorem 1: Consider a wireless network with n links and\ni.i.d. random channel coefficients with pdf f (x), cdf F (x), and\nmean \u03bc. Choose any t > 0 and define q = 1 \u2212 F (t). Then, a\nsum-rate of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\n\u221a\nR(t) = (nq \u2212 \u03ben nq) log 1 +\n(6)\n\u221a\n\u03bc(nq \u2212 \u03ben nq) + \u03c6n\n\u221a\nis a.a.s. achievable for any \u03ben = o( nq) that approaches\n\u221a\ninfinity as n \u2192 \u221e and any \u03c6n = \u03c8(nq \u2212 \u03ben nq), where\n\u03c8(n) makes the function\n\u0013\n\u0012\nc\n(7)\nn log 1 +\n\u03bcn + \u03c8(n)\nincreasing in k for any constant c, and \u03c8(n) \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\nProof: By applying Strategy 1, we obtained a lower\nbound on the achievable sum-rate in (5). According to condition (7), this lower bound is increasing in k. Thus, if we\nreplace the number of active links, k, by its possible lower\nbound, the achievability result remains valid. However, from\nLemma 1 we know that\n\u221a\na.a.s.\n(8)\nk > nq \u2212 \u03ben nq\n\n\f\u221a\nBy the assumption \u03ben = o( nq), the lower bound in (8) is\nnon-negative and can replace k in (5) to give (6) with \u03c6n =\n\u221a\n\u03c8(nq \u2212 \u03ben nq).\nTo facilitate working with the result of Theorem 1, in the\nsequel we will ignore the terms containing \u03ben and \u03c8n . This\nis justified by the fact that these functions can be chosen\narbitrarily small and we are only interested on the order of\nparameters such as R, t, and k. Thus, we have the following\nsimplified corollary.\nCorollary 1: Under the conditions described in Theorem 1,\nthe achieves the sum-rate and the number of active links in\nStrategy 1 are obtained as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\nR(t) = nq log 1 +\na.a.s.\n(9)\n\u03bcnq\nk \u223c nq\na.a.s.\n(10)\nBy defining the rate-per-link as \u03bb = R/k, we have the\nfollowing corollary.\nCorollary 2: The rate-per-link in Strategy 1 scales as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\na.a.s.\n\u03bb \u223c log 1 +\n\u03bcnq\nAs specified in (6), the achievable sum-rate in Theorem 1\nis a function of the parameter t. Thus, t can be chosen such\nthat the achievable sum-rate in Theorem 1 is maximized. Let's\ndefine\nt\u2217\nR\n\n\u2217\n\n= arg max R(t),\nt\n\n= max R(t)\nt\n\nto be the optimum threshold and the maximum achievable\nsum-rate, respectively. In general, the values of t\u2217 and R\u2217 are\nfunctions of n, but how they scale with n strongly depends on\nthe channel distribution function f (x). This will be elaborated\non in the next section through some examples of fading\nchannels.\nIV. C ASE S TUDY\nIn this section, we apply the results of the previous section\nto the Rayleigh and log-normal fading channel models. It turns\nout that the sum-rate achieved by our decentralized scheme is\nlarger than what is obtained in [11] for both cases. The proofs\nof the results can be found in [12].\nA. Rayleigh Fading\nIn a Rayleigh fading channel, the coefficients gji are exponentially distributed with f (x) = e\u2212x and \u03bc = 1. Thus,\nthe relation between q and t is described as q = e\u2212t . By\nsubstituting this value in (9) and (10), we obtain the sum-rate\nand the number of active users as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\na.a.s.\n(11)\nR(t) = ne\u2212t log 1 + \u2212t\nne\nk \u223c ne\u2212t\na.a.s.\n(12)\nIt can be verified that the optimum threshold that maximizes\n(11) is equal to\nt\u2217 = log n \u2212 2 log log n + log 2 + o(1).\n\nCorollary 3: In a wireless network with n links and under\nRayleigh fading channel model, Strategy 1 with optimum\nthreshold t\u2217 yields\nR\u2217\n\n=\n\nk\n\n=\n\n\u03bb \u223c\n\nlog n \u2212 2 log log n + O(1)\n1\nlog2 n(1 + o(1))\n2\n2\nlog n\n\na.a.s.\na.a.s.\na.a.s.\n\nThe achieved sum-rate is at least by a factor of four larger\nthan what is obtained in the centralized scheme of [11].\nB. Log-normal Fading\nConsider a network with channel strengths drawn i.i.d. from\na log-normal distribution with parameters S and M [11]. It\ncan be easily verified that for large values of t, the following\nrelation holds between q and t\n!\n2\n(log t \u2212 M )\nS\nexp \u2212\n.\nq\u2248 \u221a\n2S 2\n2\u03c0(log t \u2212 M )\nBy substituting this value of q in (9), the sum-rate, as a\nfunction of t, is obtained as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nu2\nu 2S\n2\nS n \u2212 u22\nBue\ne\n\uf8f8,\nR(t) = \u221a\ne 2S log \uf8ed1 +\n(13)\nn\n2\u03c0 u\nwhere, for the brevity of notation, we have defined\nu = log t \u2212 M . Also, B is a constant depending on the\ndistribution parameters. It can be verified that the maximizing\nt for (13) is equal to\n2\n\nt\u2217 \u223c eM\u2212S eS\n\n\u221a\n2 log n\n\n.\n\nCorollary 4: In a wireless network with n links and under\nlog-normal fading channel model, Strategy 1 with optimum\nthreshold t\u2217 yields\nR\u2217\n\n\u223c\n\nk\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03bb \u223c\n\n3S 2\n\n\u221a\n\ne\u2212 2 eS 2 log n\n3S 2\n\u221a\ne\u2212 2 p\n\u221a\nlog neS 2 log n\n8S\n\u221a\n8S\n\u221a\nlog n\n\na.a.s.\na.a.s.\na.a.s.\n\n\u221a\n\nThe sum-rate scaling of eS 2 log n is, at least by a factor of\nlog n/ log log n, larger than what is obtained in the centralized\nscheme of [11].\nV. N ON -Z ERO R ATE - PER -L INK\nIn the previous section, it was shown that under Rayleigh\nfading model1 Strategy 1 provides rate-per-links that scale\nas log2 n . This rate, that approaches zero as n \u2192 \u221e, is not\ndesirable in a practical scenario where each link requires a\nconstant rate in the order of \u0398(1). In this section, we show\nthat the on-off strategy is capable of providing such amounts\n1 For brevity, in this section we only study the Rayleigh fading model.\nHowever, the same arguments can be presented for other fading models.\n\n\f5) If k \u223c n1\u2212\u01ebn for some \u01ebn \u2192 0+ , we have\n\nof rate-per-link. First, we need the following lemma that\nexpresses the achievable sum-rate in terms of the number of\nactive links.\nLemma 2: In a wireless network with Rayleigh fading\nchannels, if the k best links (links with largest direct channel coefficients) are permitted transmission, then, the a.a.s.\nachievable sum-rate is related to k according to (14) at the\nbottom of this page.\nProof: The proof relies on (11) and (12) that relate the\nparameters t, k, and R. We rewrite (12) in the following form,\nwhich is more useful in this proof:\n\nwhich results in R = o(log n).\nEach line in (14) describes a range of variations for k that leads\nto the specified order of sum-rate. For example, the third line\ncorresponds to the maximum sum-rate, log n. In this section,\nwe are interested in two other ranges of k that lead to sumrates of order \u0398(log n). These ranges include k \u223c \u03b1 log n and\nk \u223c n\u03b1+\u01ebn and will be addressed in the following subsections\nseparately.\n\nt \u223c log n \u2212 log k.\n\nA. Non-Zero Rate-per-Links by Decentralized On-Off Strategy\n\nIn what follows, the proof is presented in a case by case basis.\nlog n\n, where \u03b6n \u2192 \u221e\n1) If k = o(log n), we can write k =\n\u03b6n\nas n \u2192 \u221e. Hence, we obtain\nt = log n \u2212 log log n + log(\u03b6n ).\nConsequently, from (11) we obtain\n!\nlog n\nlog n\nR\u223c\nlog log n = o(log n).\n\u03b6n\n\u03b6\n2) If k \u223c \u03b1 log n for some constant \u03b1 > 0, we have\nAs a result, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nlog n\n\u223c \u03b1 log n log 1 +\n\u03b1 log n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n= \u03b1 log 1 +\nlog n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n3) If k = \u03c9(log n) and k = o(n ) for all 0 < \u03b1 < 1, we\nshould have t \u223c log n. Hence, we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nlog n\nR \u223c \u03c9(log n) log 1 +\n\u223c log n,\n\u03c9(log n)\nwhere the last equality is based on the approximation\nlog(1 + x) \u2248 x for small values of x.\n4) If k \u223c n\u03b1+\u01ebn for some 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and some \u01ebn \u2192 0,\nwe should have\n\nSubstituting these values of k and t in (11) gives\nR \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b1) log n.\n\uf8f1\no(log n)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b1 log 1 + \u03b11 log n\nlog n\nR\u223c\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) log n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\no(log n)\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\nk\n\n\u223c\n\nR\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03b1 log n,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nlog n,\n\u03b1 log 1 +\n\u03b1\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is a constant. In fact, this increased rate-per-link is the\nresult of allowing less users to be simultaneously active.\nA closer examination of (15) and (16) reveals a tradeoff\nbetween the number of active users and the rate-per-link. To\nformulate this tradeoff let us define\nkn\n,\n(17)\n\u03ba = lim\nn\u2192\u221e log n\n\nt \u223c log n \u2212 log log n \u2212 log \u03b1.\n\nt \u223c log n \u2212 log n\u03b1+\u01ebn \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b1) log n.\n\nAccording to Lemma 2, when k = \u0398(log n), sum-rate is\nof order \u0398(log n) as well. In this case, rate per link scales as\n\u0398(1). More precisely, in this range of operation we have\n\nfor some \u03b1 > 0. These values of k and R yield to the\nrate-per-link\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bb = log 1 +\n,\n(16)\n\u03b1\n\nn\n\nR\n\nt \u223c log n \u2212 log n1\u2212\u01ebn = \u01ebn log n = o(log n),\n\nto be the scaling factor of the number of users. Then, from\nthis definition and from (15) and (16) we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bb = log 1 +\n.\n(18)\n\u03ba\nB. Non-Zero Rate-per-Links by Centralized On-Off Strategy\nAccording to Lemma 2, when k \u223c n\u03b1+\u01ebn for some\n0 < \u03b1 < 1 and some \u01ebn \u2192 0, the sum-rate scales as\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) log n, but the rate-per-link approaches zero as n \u2192 \u221e.\nHowever, if a centralized link activation is allowed, it will be\npossible to choose a subset of the links with small mutual\ninterference such that the rate of each link is in the order of\n\u0398(1). The selection process should be such that the number of\nactive links is large enough to avoid deteriorating the network\nthroughput. As will be seen later, this is guaranteed since the\n\n= o(log n)\n\u223c \u03b1 log n for some \u03b1 > 0\n.\n= \u03c9(log n) and k = o(n\u03b1 ), \u2200 0 < \u03b1 < 1\n\u223c n\u03b1+\u01ebn for some 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and some \u01ebn \u2192 0\n\u223c n1\u2212\u01ebn for some \u01ebn \u2192 0+\n\n(14)\n\n\fConsequently, by using \u03c0 from (19) and with k \u223c n\u03b1+\u01ebn , the\nnumber of links selected by Strategy 2 is obtained as\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03bb\n\nk\u0302 \u223c\n\n0\n\n10\n\nCentralized\nDecentralized\n\u22124\n\n10\n\nFig. 1.\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u03ba\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nTradeoff between rate-per-link and the number of active links.\n\nnumber of primarily selected links, i.e. k, is large. Strategy 2\ndescribes one possible interference management policy.\nStrategy 2: For a threshold \u03b4 > 0, from the set\nof links whose direct channel coefficients are larger than\nt = (1 \u2212 \u03b1) log n, choose the links whose cross channel coefficients are less than \u03b4.\nSince Strategy 2 requires the knowledge of all channel\ncoefficients by a central unit, it can only be implemented\nas a centralized scheme. In the following, we show that one\ncan choose the value of \u03b4 optimally such that the sum-rate\nis maximized; this optimum value yields to rate-per-links of\norder \u0398(1).\nAssume V = {1, * * * , k} is the set of links whose direct\nchannel coefficients are larger than t = (1\u2212\u03b1) log n. Construct\nan undirected graph G(V , E) with vertex set V and the\nadjacency matrix E = [eij ] defined as\n\u001a\n1 ; gij \u2264 \u03b4 and gji \u2264 \u03b4\n.\neij =\n0 ; otherwise\nIt can be easily verified that the probability of having an edge\nbetween vertices i and j for the special case of Rayleigh fading\nchannel equals\n\u00012\n\u03c0 = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4 .\n(19)\n\nThe definition of G implies that G \u2208 G(k, \u03c0), where G(k, \u03c0) is\nthe family of k-vertex random graphs with edge probability \u03c0.\nIn strategy 2, we are interested to choose the maximum\nnumber of links whose interference coefficients are smaller\nthan \u03b4. This is equivalent to choose the largest complete\nsubgraph of G. The size of the largest complete subgraph of\nG is called its clique number. The following lemma provides\nthe scaling law of the clique number of a random graph.\nLemma 3 ( [13]): For a fixed 0 < \u03c0 < 1, the clique number\nXk (G) of G \u2208 G(k, \u03c0) scales as\nXk \u223c\n\n2 log k\nlog 1/\u03c0\n\na.a.s.\n\n\u2212\u03b1\nlog n.\nlog (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4 )\n\n(20)\n\nWith this number of users and by taking the same approach\nas in the derivation of (9), the sum-rate is lower bounded as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03b4\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) log 1 \u2212 e\n\u2212\u03b1\nR\u2265\nlog \uf8ec\n1\u2212\n\u0013 \uf8f7\n\u0012\n\u2212\u03b4\n\uf8f8 log n.\n\u2212\u03b4\n\uf8ed\nlog (1 \u2212 e )\n\u03b4e\n\u03b1 1\u2212\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4\n(21)\n\u03b4e\u2212\u03b4\nNote that (1 \u2212\n) in the denominator is the expected\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4\nvalue of the cross channel coefficients conditioned on being\nless than \u03b4.\nThe lower bound in (21)is logarithmic in n as desired. Since\nthe number of active links in (20) is logarithmic in n as well,\nwe conclude that rate-per-link scales as \u0398(1).\nThe scaling factor of log n in (21), which is independent of\nn, can be numerically maximized with respect to \u03b4. Similar to\n(18) that describes the tradeoff between \u03bb and \u03ba (the scaling\nfactor of the number of active links defined in (17)) for the\ncentralized scheme, here we can find this tradeoff numerically.\nFig. 1 demonstrates the tradeoff between \u03bb and \u03ba for the\ncentralized and decentralized schemes. For the centralized\nscheme the value of \u03b4 that maximizes (21) has been used.\nAs observed, for a ceratin value of \u03bb the centralized scheme\ncan support larger number of users, especially for larger values\nof \u03bb. It should be mentioned that the decentralized scheme not\nonly achieves non-zero rate-per-link, but provides a sum-rate\nclose to log n at large values of \u03bb.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] P. Gupta and P. R.
