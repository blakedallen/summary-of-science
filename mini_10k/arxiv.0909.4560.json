INTRODUCTION\nMasses of pre-main sequence (PMS) objects are quite difficult to determine, and the only direct way to assess them is through the analysis of their\ndynamical parameters. Following Cohen & Kuhi (1979) locating objects in a\ntemperature-luminosity H-R diagram along with evolutionary models yields\nmasses. Since stellar temperature is estimated from colors, and these are\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n\naffected by circumstellar disks, PMS temperatures are best estimated spectroscopically (e.g., Luhman et al. 2005). But PMS objects are usually faint\nand found in dusty environments and obtaining their spectra becomes quite\ndifficult. This has lead many authors to explore the initial mass function\n(IMF) of young stellar clusters in the infrared, via the luminosity function\nin the K-band (e.g., Muench et al. 2002), assuming that it reproduces the\ntrue IMF of a cluster. Color-color (CC) and color-magnitude (CM) nearinfrared diagrams of young stellar clusters show that intrinsic near-infrared\ncolors of young stars are affected both by interstellar extinction and by disk\nexcess emission (Lada & Adams 1992; Hillenbrand et al. 1992; Meyer et al.\n1997; Hillenbrand & Carpenter 2000).\nL\u00f3pez-Chico & Salas (2007), hereon LS07, showed that masses of T Tauri\nstars can be obtained using JHK photometry and both CC and CM diagrams.\nThis is the result of the analysis of two principal vectors, one produced by the\n~ and the other by interstellar extinction, X,\n~ if stellar ages are\ndisk excess, D\nknown and a particular set of evolutionary tracks is assumed.\nIn this paper we continue the development of a new approach in determining masses of pre-main sequence stars from near-infrared photometry. Our\ngoal is to strengthen the results reported previously in LS07. First, we refine\nthe values of disk excess coefficients given in LS07 by showing that the method\ncan be extended to the I and L filters, and that these coefficients scale well\nwith wavelength. This analysis is presented in section 2. Second, we test\nwhether the method can be used to extract the Initial Mass Function (IMF)\nof young stellar clusters from infrared photometric data alone. Sect. 3 shows\nthat if the age of a young cluster is known the distribution of stellar masses\ncan be obtained from their JHK photometry and a set of PMS evolutionary\ntracks. As a proof of this statement we apply the method to the well studied\nTaurus-Auriga region and the Orion Nebula Cluster. It is shown that the\nmedian age of the clusters produces an excellent agreement with previously\nknown IMFs. These results are reported in Sects. 4 and 5, while a summary\nof our results is presented in Sect. 6.\n2. METHOD DESCRIPTION\nL\u00f3pez-Chico & Salas (2007) showed that masses of T Tauri stars can be\nobtained using their JHK photometry and their location in both CC and\nCM diagrams. This is the result of the analysis of two principal vectors, one\n~ and the other by interstellar extinction,\nproduced by the disk contribution, D,\n~ LS07 show that the vector X\nb can be defined as the extinction vector\nX.\ncorresponding to AV =10 with components given in Rieke & Lebofsky (1985).\nb is obtained via J, H, and K magnitudes obtained from\nWhile the vector D\nD'Alessio et al. (2005) models of accretion disks irradiated by a central T\nTauri star. These base vectors were thus given the following components in\nCM ( K vs. (J \u2212 K)) and CC ((J \u2212 H) vs. (H \u2212 K)) diagrams:\nd\nd\nD\ncm = (1.014, \u22121.105) ; Xcm = (1.68, 1.16)\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1\nCOEFFICIENTS X\u03bb AND Y\u03bb FOR\nEXTINCTION AND DISK\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nFilter\n\nx\u03bb a\n\ny\u03bb\n\nI\n\n4.82\n\n0.064\n\n0.08\n\n2.82\n\nc\n\n0.15\n\nc\n\n0.43\n\nJ\n\n0.15\n\ny\u03bb b\n\nH\n\n1.75\n\n0.40\n\nK\n\n1.12\n\n1.19c\n\n1.12\n\nL\n\n0.58\n\n4.86\n\n4.93\n\na From\n\nRieke & Lebofsky (1985)\ny\u03bb \u221d \u03bb3 .\nc From L\u00f3pez-Chico & Salas (2007)\n\nb Using\n\n(1)\nd\nd\nD\ncc = (0.767, 0.221) ; Xcc = (0.61, 1.07)\nThe position of a particular star in these CC and CM diagrams becomes then\na vector sum in each diagram that can be reduced to a closure relation plus\nthe following set of linear equations:\nJ = J0 + \u03b1xJ \u2212 \u03b2yJ\nH = H0 + \u03b1xH \u2212 \u03b2yH\n\n(2)\n\nK = K0 + \u03b1xK \u2212 \u03b2yK\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent the amount of extinction and infrared excess contributions to the individual magnitudes, x\u03bb and y\u03bb are the corresponding\nextinction and disk coefficients for each wavelength \u03bb, and the 0 sub-indices\ndenote the intrinsic photospheric magnitudes. Values for x\u03bb and y\u03bb are obtained directly from the components of base vectors given in eq. (1) and are\npresented in Table 1.\nAn advantage of presenting the equations as a set of linear equations is\nthat it can be easily explored with any set of three photometric filters at a\ntime, that is, we may use filters IJK or JKL instead of JHK, provided the\ncorresponding closure condition is fulfilled and that the excess colors behave\nas vectors. We found that this procedure is also feasible for filters I and L in\naddition to the JHK set, and so the numerical values of the y\u03bb coefficients\nfor I and L are included in Table 1. We show in Figure 1 that the relation\nbetween log y\u03bb and log \u03bb can be well represented by a power-law index equal\nto 3. This close relation gives us confidence to refine the y\u03bb values as given in\nthe last column of Table 1, which are the values that we used in our analysis.\n\n\f4\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n\nFig. 1. Plot of log y\u03bb as a function of log \u03bb shows that for IJHKL the data are well\nrepresented by a power-law of index=3, shown as a solid line.\n\nAs is shown in LS07 stellar masses can be obtained from the solutions of\nthe minimization of the quadratic error Err given by\n\u00012\nn\nX\nm\u03bb \u2212 mobs\n\u03bb\n2\n(3)\nErr =\nn\n\u03bb=1\n\nwhere mobs\nis the observed magnitude at each wavelength \u03bb and m\u03bb is the\n\u03bb\nmagnitude that should be observed according to the model:\nm\u03bb = m0\u03bb (mass, age) + d + \u03b1x\u03bb \u2212 \u03b2y\u03bb .\n\n(4)\n\nIn eq. (4) the stellar magnitude is the sum of the absolute magnitude for a\ncertain mass and age, plus the distance modulus d to the object, plus the extinction correction and the infrared excess contribution from the circumstellar\ndisk. The error is then minimized with respect to its four parameters: mass,\nage, \u03b1 and \u03b2. This minimization procedure is a set of linear equations for \u03b1\nand \u03b2. To deal with mass and age we compute Err for each single mass and\nage taken from pre-main sequence evolutionary models. Then one seeks the\nminimum of Err consistent with the additional constraints \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 >\n0 obtained for each star. This method is called the extinction-disk principal\nvector, XDPV method.\nTo test the XDPV method we will use only the PMS tracks from D'Antona & Mazzitelli\n(1997) and http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html that provide luminosities and temperatures for pre-main sequence stars in a wide lowmass range, from 0.017 to 3 M\u2299 and ages from 104 to 108 yr. The use of other\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n5\n\nevolutionary tracks, (e.g. Palla & Stahler 1999), has been discussed in LS07.\nThese authors argue that these tracks are found to produce similar mass results within 20%. Luminosity and effective temperature of the evolutionary\ntracks are converted into absolute magnitudes using bolometric corrections\nand normal colors given in Kenyon & Hartmann (1995).\n3. MASSES OF YOUNG STELLAR CLUSTER STARS\nIn LS07 we showed that if the masses of young stars are known, e.g. spectroscopically, the proposed XDPV method is a powerful tool to derive their\nages or conversely, if the ages are known the masses can be extracted. However, both cannot be derived simultaneously. This is due, as pointed out in\nLS07, to the fact that the minimal of Err as a function of mass and age is a\nregion that resembles a long and narrow canyon (c.f. their Fig. 7) that spans\na wide range in masses and ages, providing a continuum of possible solutions.\nIt is then necessary to specify an age for the PMS object to determine its\nmass.\nHowever, when dealing with a cluster of stars with similar ages, a representative age of the cluster may be used for all the individual members. Doing\nso requires a compromise age that would compensate the errors in mass by\nassuming a too young age for some objects with those errors derived from assuming an older age. The median age bisects the age histogram in equal parts,\nso that an equivalent number of members is either younger or older. Furthermore, the median is a robust indicator of the central tendency, its value is the\nsame whether one uses the histogram of ages in linear or logarithmic values,\nand in general is a better choice when we only have one number to specify a\ndistribution. For these reasons, we have chosen to use the median age of each\ncluster.\nWe will show that this age selection gives consistent results for the resulting\nmass histograms of the well studied young stellar clusters of Taurus-Auriga\nand Orion, through the comparison of the IMF obtained by other authors\nusing spectroscopic or photometric methods, and the IMF obtained applying\nour algorithm. We note that in the young stellar clusters studied here, the\nmedian age has a lower value than the mean, due to a fraction of younger stars\nin the tail of the distribution. For Taurus-Auriga we obtain log median = 5.8\n(0.63 Myr) and log mean = 5.95 (0.89 Myr), while for Orion log median = 5.6\n(0.4 Myr) and log mean = 5.8 (0.63 Myr), as is described in detail below.\nThese values are significantly younger than what is commonly assumed as the\nage of the clusters. But this has to be that way, because one usually refers to\nthe epoch at which star formation began, which is the upper limit of the age\ndistribution.\nThe method produces very good results as is shown below. Although it\nmay seem a disadvantage to have to specify a cluster age, it is still far less\ninformation that the requirement of spectral types in spectroscopic methods,\nor a parametric description of the age distribution required in some other\nphotometric methods.\n\n\f6\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n4. TAURUS-AURIGA\n\nAs pointed out by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995), hereon KH95, the TaurusAuriga is an ideal laboratory to study low-mass star formation, dominated by\nlow-mass stars with little extinction, and so has been the subject of many investigations. The list of known members of the region has grown through the\nyears (Cohen & Kuhi 1979; Herbig & Bell 1988, 1995; Kenyon & Hartmann\n1995; Brice\u00f1o et al. 2002; Luhman 2004; Luhman et al. 2006; Guieu et al.\n2006; Scelsi et al. 2007), with an increasing emphasis towards completeness.\nAs we discussed above, to estimate masses the XDPV method requires\nage estimates in addition to near-infrared photometry. We will take this age\nfrom the histogram of ages presented by KH95 (their Fig. 16). They have\nderived these ages together with masses from a full set of visible and infrared photometry and spectral types for known Taurus-Auriga members in\n1995. Their age distribution spans from log(age(yr)) \u2261 log T = 4 to 6.5\nand we calculate a mean value of 5.95 and a median value of 5.8 (T =6.3\u00d7105\nyr), which on one hand is smaller than the commonly assumed value of 6.3,\nand also smaller than the mean. We may go on to compare masses derived\nby our method. KH97 present spectral types and effective temperatures for\n139 stars. They use 103 of them to construct a mass histogram from HR diagrams with D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1994) tracks with CMA opacities.\nWe took 189 stars with JHK photometry from their list, and calculated\nmasses as described in Sect. 2 above, using the median age derived (log T =5.8)\nfrom KH95, and the evolutionary models of D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) and\nhttp://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html.\nWe compare mass histograms in Fig. 2. To do so, we have re-binned\nKH95's histogram in logarithmic 0.3 dex bins, by assigning random masses\nto each star within its own bin, and then re-binning in the logarithmic bins.\nWe repeated this process 100 times to produce the mean histogram that is\nshown by dotted lines in Fig. 2, while our mass histogram is shown as solid\nlines. For reference the Miller-Scalo IMF (Miller & Scalo 1979) is shown as a\ndashed line. The general shape from 0.3 to 1 M\u2299 is remarkably similar in both\nhistograms and both peak at the same value where a turnover is observed. The\nexcess number of stars in our analysis (189 of 103) appear in three regions\nof the distribution. Some are in equal proportions in the three bins from\nlog M = 0.1 to -0.5 M\u2299 , some lie in the high-mass end of the distribution\nwhich nevertheless agrees quite well with the IMF of Miller & Scalo (1979),\nand the majority are distributed in low-mass bins log M/M\u2299 < -0.8, that most\nprobably were too faint to provide a reliable spectral type by KH95. However,\nthis low-mass region is not unbiased or complete, as is pointed out in their\npaper.\nBrice\u00f1o et al. (2002); Luhman (2004) and Luhman et al. (2006) have paid\nattention to this fact, and have conducted spectroscopic surveys of several regions in the Taurus-Auriga clouds in order to identify all low-mass stars (many\nof which are brown dwarfs) to get complete unbiased samples of the IMF.\nThis IMF is the result of photometry and spectroscopy to determine lumi-\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n7\n\nFig. 2.

(2006) for one of such complete regions that are consistent with Luhman (2004) IMF. In this new article, Luhman incorporated\nsome 20 newly discovered brown dwarfs into a large region that encompasses\nabout half of the known Taurus population, and thus constitutes a significant sample. With our method we were able to obtain solutions for 125\nobjects out of the presented list of 156, again using the median age derived\nfrom KH95, and the evolutionary models of D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997)\nand http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html.\nAs can be observed in Fig. 3 the resemblance between the IMF obtained\nby Luhman (2004) and the IMF obtained using the XDPV method for the\nTaurus-Auriga region is remarkable, with a probability of over 60% of being\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n9\n\nrandom samples of the same population. For a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of\nthis result and others, see section 6.\nFurthermore, the XDPV solutions for both data sets (Kenyon & Hartmann\n1995; Luhman 2004) presented in Figures 2 and 3, resemble one another better\nthat those presented in the original papers. We conclude that this agreement\nstrengthens our results.\n5. ORION NEBULA CLUSTER\n5.1. About the IMF\nThe Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) centered on the Trapezium OB stars is\nthe richest of any nearby clusters and has been studied extensively. Numerous\nstudies have targeted this cluster to determine its underlying population and\nthe associated IMF (e.g. Hillenbrand 1997; Luhman et al. 2000; Muench et al.\n2002). We will compare our own results to those of two important studies,\none spectroscopic and one based on near-infrared photometry.\nHillenbrand (1997) has obtained spectral types for 934 visible stars. This\ninformation, supplemented by optical photometry, allowed her to populate\nan H-R diagram with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks, and to extract mass and age information. She notes, however, that large uncertainties arise from the choice of a particular set of evolutionary tracks (see also\nHillenbrand & White 2004). Nevertheless, Hillenbrand (1997) chooses D'Antona & Mazzitelli\n(1994) evolutionary models to display the ONC's IMF (her Fig. 17), and it\nhas become a seminal reference for this region. The derived distribution of\nstellar ages of the ONC population conform a distribution that spans a wide\nrange of ages. It starts at log T = 3.5 (3000 yr) and increases gradually until\nlog T = 6.3 (2 Myr), then decreases abruptly and continues at a low constant pace up to log T = 7.8 (63 Myr). This distribution has a mean value of\nlog < T > = 5.84 (0.7 Myr) although some authors quote 0.8 Myr. It has also\nbeen represented by a constant rate from log T = 5 (0.1 Myr) to log T = 6 (1\nMyr). In our treatment of the OMC cluster we will choose the median age,\nlog T = 5.6 (0.4 Myr), which we believe is the best compromise as is discussed\nabove for Taurus-Auriga. This is in agreement with Luhman et al. (2000)\nwork that also quotes a median age of 0.4 Myr.\nMuench et al. (2000) developed a Monte Carlo method to model the IMF\nbased in obtaining the KLF from a series of probability distributions: extinction, infrared excess, age and the IMF modeled as a series of power laws. They\napplied this method to JHK observations of the ONC in Muench et al. (2002).\nThe age distribution was chosen as a uniform distribution from 0.2\u00d7106 to\n1.4\u00d7106 yr. The extinction distribution was derived from (J \u2212H) vs. (H \u2212K)\ndiagram by de-reddening sources down to the classical T Tauri star locus of\nMeyer et al. (1997). After this, the infrared excess distribution was obtained\nfrom the remaining excess in the (H \u2212 K) color after subtracting a histogram\nof (H \u2212 K) colors of field stars, and this excess color was assumed to arise\nexclusively from excess disk emission at K. From an original set of \u223c1000\n\n\f10\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n\nsources, they took an extinction limited sample (AV < 17) of 583 stars, which\nis said to be complete down to 0.017 M\u2299 .\nWe took JHK photometry from the Muench et al. (2002) published list,\nassumed a median age of log T = 5.6 from Hillenbrand (1997) age histogram,\nused D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) and http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html\nevolutionary tracks, and assumed a distance of 400 pc (Muench et al. 2002).\nWith these ingredients we applied our XDPV method to the 699 object where\nno confusion flags are found and photometry is available in all JHK filters.\nWe were able to obtain solutions consistent with both \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 and\nan acceptable Err < 0.3 mag for 612 of these stars. Objects for which no\nsolution was found are, for example, stars more massive than those present in\nD'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) and http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html\nevolutionary tracks, maximum of 3 M\u2299 , which includes all the Trapezium\nstars, BN and \u03982 Ori A. From the 612 PMS objects we then selected 578 with\nAV < 17 to display in Fig. 4. This compares our IMF (solid histogram) with\nthat of Hillenbrand (1997), points with error bars, and Muench et al. (2002)\nshown as a dashed line. The agreement with Muench et al. (2002) is excellent,\nthat is, the initial slope for high-mass stars, the flattening and the position\nof the turnover, followed by the negative slope in the subsolar mass spectrum\nall agree quite well. The only exception is for the low-mass secondary peak in\nthe substellar region (log M/M\u2299 = -1.8). Unfortunately, those objects come\nfrom the low-brightness peaks in the H and K histograms in Muench et al.\n(2002) but are too faint and red, and therefore, absent in J. Consequently,\nthey do not appear in our data.\nThe agreement with the Hillenbrand (1997) IMF is quite good in the -0.9\n< log M/M\u2299 < 0.45 range. Massive stars (M>3 M\u2299 ) are missing in our histogram as mentioned above, due to the limitted mass range in the evolutionary\ntracks. In the log(M/M\u2299 ) < -1 range, the Hillenbrand (1997) survey is most\nlikely incomplete for sources with AV > 2.5 (Hillenbrand & Carpenter 2000).\nThe position of the turnover also agrees, although the exact position may\nbe at slightly lower masses as has been revised in Hillenbrand & Carpenter\n(2000) by using updated evolutionary tracks and transformations.\nWe conclude that the IMF we obtained with the XDPV method is a robust representation of that obtained by other methods. For a more through\ncomparison of these distributions see section 6.\n5.2. Extinction and infrared excess\nIn addition to the mass data, our method also gives information about\nthe extinction \u03b1 and infrared excess \u03b2 of the sources. We display these two\nquantities as histograms in Fig. 5, and compare them with extinctions and\nexcesses used in Muench et al. (2002) and Hillenbrand (1997).\nThe bottom left panel shows the histogram of extinction \u03b1 as a solid\nhistogram. This quantity can be directly understood in terms of the visual\nextinction, \u03b1 = AV /10. It is then easy to compare it with the extinction\nprobability distribution presented in Muench et al. (2002), shown here as a\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n11\n\nFig. 4. ONC's IMF (solid histogram) compared to Hillenbrand (1997) (points with\nerror bars) and Muench et al. (2002) (dashed line).\n\n\f12\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n\nsolid line, which is very close to our result. In order to compare with the spectroscopically derived extinctions in Hillenbrand (1997), we show the dashed\nhistogram for those sources that were analyzed by us and that are also part\nof the Hillenbrand (1997) survey, and compare it to the dashed line obtained\nfrom extinctions derived by her. A discrepancy is notorious for the very low\nextinction (AV < 2) sources, where Hillenbrand (1997) finds most sources\nand our histogram turns over.\nIn the bottom right panel we show the histogram for \u03b2 compared to the\ninfrared excess distribution in Muench et al. (2002). However, there are two\npossibilities for this comparison. If the abscissa in Muench et al. (2002) Fig. 8b\nis the excess in H \u2212 K, then from eq. (2) \u03b2 = EH\u2212K /(yK \u2212 yH ), while if the\nabscissa is taken as the excess in K alone, then \u03b2 = \u2212EK /yK , and given the\nvalues in Table 1, they are not equal. We show both possibilities in Fig. 5d.\nThe infrared excess is best represented by \u03b2 and we find a better agreement\nwhen the infrared excess distribution is represented by \u2212EK , rather than\nEH\u2212K .\nIn the top panels of Fig. 5 we show \u03b1 and \u03b2 as functions of mass log M . As\na general rule, no dependence of these two quantities with mass is found, as \u03b1\nand \u03b2 acquire all their values for any mass in the range from 0.017 to 3.0 M\u2299 .\nThe one exception is observed in the case of \u03b1 (Fig. 5a): there are no lowmass stars at high extinctions. This is more notorious in the case of those stars\nalso observed by Hillenbrand (1997), marked as solid dots, where a diagonal\nline in the upper rightmost part of the diagram can easily be drawn. This\nis expected to be the case, since low-mass stars cannot be observed at high\nextinctions for given observation times, and since this fact was not introduced\na priori in the method, it constitutes another confirming result of the XDPV\napproach. In this diagram it is then possible to extract an extinction limited\nsample, as a rectangular box that lies below the diagonal line corresponding\nto each sample. It can be seen that Hillenbrand (1997) survey is unbiased for\nlog M/M\u2299 > -1.1 and AV < 3, in close agreement with her findings (see also\nHillenbrand & Carpenter 2000). On the other hand, the completeness limit\nin all three JHK filters in the Muench et al. (2002) survey would go up to\nlog M/M\u2299 > -1.8 and AV < 6. Finally. given that the infrared excess \u03b2 is\ndue to the disk contribution we find that 300 stars out of 612 (close to 50%)\npresumably possess associated disks (\u03b2 > 0), independently of their mass.\nThis is consistent with recent Spitzer studies that show that the percentage\nof low-mass PMS stars with disk in ONC is about 50% (Rebull et al. 2006;\nCieza & Baliber 2007)\n\n6. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMFS\nFor two young stellar clusters a general concern is whether the individual\nIMFs are different or not, given that the shapes of the IMFs look similar.\nTo quantify this we performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. First, we\ncompared the mostly accepted mass distributions for Taurus and Orion, to\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n13\n\nFig. 5. Top panels: \u03b1 and \u03b2 as function of mass. In panel a) sources also in the\nsurvey of Hillenbrand (1997) are marked as dots. Bottom panels: histograms of\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 in solid lines, are compared to c) the extinction probability distribution\nof Muench et al. (2002) solid line, and the extinction data in Hillenbrand (1997)\nin dashed line to its corresponding dashed line histogram. d) The infrared excess\nprobability distribution of Muench et al. (2002) if considered as E(H \u2212 K) (dashed\nline) or K-excess (solid line).\n\n\f14\n\nSALAS, & CRUZ-GONZ\u00c1LEZ\n\nshow that they are significantly different. Second, we compared the IMFs\nobtained by the XDPV method to both the Taurus and Orion cases.\nTo perform the K-S test we developed a routine that generates a random\npopulation of stellar masses from any given mass distribution N (log M ) using\nthe well known accept-reject algorithm. For each distribution that we tested,\nwe generated a number of random stellar masses equal to the number of\nstars that were used to obtain the original distribution, in order to keep the\nsame stochastic variability that would be expected in a different realization\nof the distribution. For each comparison between different distributions, we\ntook 100 realizations of each distribution being compared. and computed\nthe two distribution K-S probabilities that the samples are drawn from the\nsame parent distributions (null hypothesis). We report the mean of these 100\ncomparisons (K-S MP).\nWe first tested the IMFs reported by Luhman (2004) for Taurus-Auriga\n(hereon TL) to those of Hillenbrand (1997) and Muench et al. (2002), hereon\nOH and OM respectively, for Orion. The OH distribution has the advantage\nof being derived spectroscopically (as well as the TL one), but is incomplete\nfor masses lower than log(M/M\u2299 ) < \u22120.9 as we already mentioned. For\nthis reason we limited this distribution to the medium mass range in the\ncomparisons. We therefore label it as OHM. Similarly as we already discussed,\nthe OM distribution has a secondary peak at the very low mass end which we\ncannot test because the sources involved are below the J filter detection limit.\nTherefore the OM distribution is limited to log(M/M\u2299 ) > \u22121.6 for all tests\nhere. The comparisons between TL and OHM yield a K-S mean probability\n(K-S MP) of 3\u00d710\u221211 of being drawn from the same parent distribution,\nwhile TL and OM gives K-S MP of 1\u00d710\u22124. These very small values makes\nus confident that our test is consistent with previously known results (e.g.\nLada et al. (2008)) that the distributions are indeed different.\nWe then compared the distribution of XDPV masses obtained for the\nTaurus-Auriga region (hereon TX) to TL, obtaining a K-S MP of 21% therefore confirming the posibility of both distributions being equivalent representations. The comparison of TX to OHM rules out the null hypothesis with\na K-S MP of 6\u00d710\u22125. It should be mentioned however, that TX is not that\ndifferent from OM (K-S MP of 1%) mainly because in the low mass range\n\u22121.6 < log(M/M\u2299 ) < \u22120.9 TL is quite similar to OM (K-S MP = 67%).\nThat is to say, the low mass slope of Taurus and Orion IMFs are similar.\nNevertheless, the agreement between TX and TL is sustained.\nFinally, the distribution of XDPV masses obtained for the Orion region\n(hereon OX) compares with OHM with a K-S MP of 3% in the medium mass\nrange, and a somewhat better agreement is seen to OM with K-S MP = 9% in\nthe whole range of masses log(M/M\u2299 ) > \u22121.6 . On the other hand, OX and\nTL cannot be accepted as a match with a very low K-S MP of 2\u00d710\u22127. This\nproofs that OX is not consitent with the Taurus IMF but has a fair probability\nof being drawn from the same parent population of the Orion Nebula Cluster.\n\n\fYSC MASSES FROM JHKL PHOTOMETRY\n\n15\n\n7. SUMMARY\nWe used the extinction-disk-principal vectors approach, which is called the\nXDPV method, reported previously in L\u00f3pez-Chico & Salas (2007) to show\nthat it is a powerful tool to estimate masses of pre-main sequence stars in\nclusters. The method requires a minimum of information, using as little as\nJHK (or IJK or JKL) near-infrared photometry, supplemented by a set\nof PMS evolutionary tracks (e.g. D'Antona & Mazzitelli 1997) and the median age of the cluster. For each star in the cluster, we are able to estimate\nthe contribution of the extinction vectors X~cc in the color-color diagram and\nX~cm in the color-magnitude diagram, and the disk vectors D~cc in the colorcolor diagram and D~cm in the color-magnitude diagram, using D'Alessio et al.\n(2005) accretion disk models grid of spectral energy distributions. The observed absolute magnitude at each wavelength \u03bb of a PMS object is obtained\nvia m\u03bb = m0\u03bb (mass, age) + d + \u03b1x\u03bb \u2212 \u03b2y\u03bb , where the first term corresponds to the absolute magnitude of the naked object for a certain mass\nand age, followed by the distance modulus d, the extinction correction (\u03b1x\u03bb )\nand the infrared excess contribution (\u2212\u03b2y\u03bb ) from the circumstellar disk. It\nis shown that if a representative age of the cluster, such as the median, is\nknown, the masses of each individual star can be statistically obtained from\nits near-infrared photometry alone. The XDPV method is tested in the well\nstudied regions of Taurus-Auriga and the Orion Nebula Cluster by extracting their Initial Mass Function. These IMF are in excellent agreement (K-S\ntest) to those given by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995) and Luhman (2004) for\nTaurus and Hillenbrand (1997) and Muench et al. (2002) for Orion. Since\nour algorithm also yields the extinction and disk contribution for each star\nthe distributions can be obtained. The overall extinction distribution for the\nOrion cluster is analyzed and compares well with previous work, the comparison to Muench et al. (2002) shows that the parameter \u03b1 for the extinction\nvector is \u2212EK rather than EH\u2212K . The frequency of PMS low-mass stars with\ndisks, represented by the parameter \u03b2, is about 50% in the Orion sample. It\nis also seen that the number of sources observed decreases for high values of\nextinction \u03b1, confirming a well known and expected observational effect, and\nallowing us to draw a complete extinction limited sample a posteriori. We\nconclude that our XDPV algorithm can be applied to study the IMF of young\nstellar clusters, as well as the distributions of extinction and disk infrared\nexcess.\nWe are grateful to an anonymous referee for very valuable comments that\naided in the final version of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\nBaraffe, I., Chabrier, G., Allard, F., & Hauschildt, P.
