In contrast to stabilization against a reference cavity, which is the approach\ncurrently used for the most highly stabilized lasers, stabilization against an atomic transition does\nnot suffer from Brownian thermal noise. Spectroscopy of ultra-narrow optical transitions in a cavity\noperates in a very highly saturated regime in which non-linear effects such as bistability play an\nimportant role. From the universal behavior of the Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation, we\nderive the fundamental limits for laser stabilization using direct spectroscopy of ultra-narrow atomic\nlines. We find that with current lattice clock experiments, laser linewidths of about 1 mHz can be\nachieved in principle, and the ultimate limitations of this technique are at the 1 \u03bc Hz level.\n\nUltra-stable lasers are central components of optical\natomic clocks and precision spectroscopy. Today's most\nstable lasers are made by locking the frequency of a\nprestabilized laser to a resonance of a high finesse reference cavity [1\u20133]. The phase stability of these lasers is\nlimited by thermal noise in the mirrors of the reference\ncavity [4]. They achieve linewidths below 1 Hz [5] corresponding to oscillator quality factors (Q-factors) of order\n1015 . Improving laser stability beyond the current state\nof the art will have a significant impact on precision science and quantum metrology [6], but further advances in\nlaser stability through refinement of reference cavities requires a significant investment in resources given the maturity of the optical designs involved [7]. The purpose of\nthis paper is to propose an alternative laser stabilization\ntechnique, by means of direct cavity-enhanced nonlinear\nspectroscopy, and to elucidate the rich phenomenology\nof this approach in an extreme regime of cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics and optical bistability.\nStrong optical transitions typically used for laser stabilization are not suitable for ultimate laser stability since\nthe atomic transition frequency is very sensitive to stray\nfields, collisions, etc. However, for special ultra-narrow\noptical clock transitions that are now being routinely\nused for optical atomic clocks [8\u201310], these shifts are\nsmall, very well characterized, and can in some cases be\neliminated or controlled [11].\nCompared to the use of strong transitions, the physics\nof this frequency locking scheme is non-trivial because\nthe atomic transition is strongly saturated for very small\nintensities. Additionally, sufficient free-space optical\ndepths are not available in current-generation experiments. One can circumvent this problem by working\nin a cavity-enhanced, highly non-linear, strongly saturated regime in order to achieve a signal that is strong\nenough for laser feedback. This regime has been studied\nextensively in the context of non-linear optics with alkali\natoms [12\u201315], albeit in a much less extreme limit.\nIn this paper we consider a simplified model that con-\n\ntains all the essential components of this many-atom cavity QED system (Fig. 1), but in the extreme bad cavity limit. Here, despite the unavoidable strong saturation effect, we are able to uncover a collective atomic\ninteraction regime where we preserve the superior frequency discrimination capability of a narrow atomic transition. This model serves as a basis upon which to calculate the fundamental limitations of our stabilization\nscheme, although real-world implementations will require\nmore complicated topologies. One such approach could\nbe based on the NICE-OHMS technique [16, 17],where\nthe local oscillator and signal beams are co-propagated\nthrough the cavity to reject common-mode frequency\nnoise. The effects of finite vacuum lifetime and heating could be addressed by operating two systems in a\nmultiplexed fashion, while heating could additionally be\nmitigated at the single-system level by implementing a\nRaman cooling scheme similar to that proposed in [18].\nIn our simplified theoretical analysis, we consider an\nensemble of N two-level atoms with transition frequency\n\u03c9a trapped in an optical lattice potential inside a cavity.\nThe lattice is at the magic wavelength where the difference of the AC Stark shifts of both levels vanish [19]. The\natoms are assumed to be in the vibrational ground state\nalong the lattice direction and in the Lamb-Dicke regime\nsuch that we can neglect Doppler broadening and recoil\neffects. The atomic transition is near resonant with a\ncavity resonance with frequency \u03c9c and field decay rate\n\u03ba. A laser with frequency \u03c9L is coupled into the cavity\nand the transmitted light is detected by means of balanced homodyne detection.\nThis N -atom system is described by the Hamiltonian\n\n\u0124 =\n\nN\n\u0001\n~\u03c9a X (j)\n\u03c3\u0302 + ~\u03c9c \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + ~\u03b7 e\u2212i\u03c9L t \u00e2\u2020 + h.c.\n2 j=1 z\n\n+~g\n\nN \u0010\nX\nj=1\n\n(j)\n\n\u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 + h.c.\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\n1.0e 6\n\n1.0e 2\n1.0e 0\n\n\u00a4a\n\n2\n\n\u0090n0\n\n1.0e 4\n\n1.0e - 2\n1.0e - 4\n1.0e 0\nFIG. 1.

The coupling constant\np\ng = (\u2118/~) ~\u03c9c / (2Veff \u000f0 ) is half the vacuum Rabi frequency with Veff the effective mode volume of the cavity,\n\u2118 the dipole moment of the atomic transition, and \u000f0\nthe vacuum permittivity. The cavity is classically driven\nwith amplitude \u03b7 by the in-coupled laser.\nIn addition to the coherent dynamics described by the\nHamiltonian we also need to account for dissipative processes. These are spontaneous emission from the excited\natomic state (decay rate \u03b3), decay of the atomic dipole\nwith rate T2\u22121 , and decay of the cavity field with rate\n\u03ba. We treat these dissipative processes within the usual\nBorn-Markov master equation [20]. Although we do not\nconsider inhomogeneous atom-cavity coupling, this effect\ndoes not change our results qualitatively and can in principle be taken into account primarily by a rescaling of the\ncooperativity parameter via an effective atom number.\nWe assume that the cavity is locked to the probe laser,\ni.e., \u03c9L = \u03c9c . This could be achieved for example by using a frequency-offset Pound-Drever-Hall locking scheme\n[21] on a different cavity longitudinal mode in conjunction with a piezo-tuneable cavity. Effects due to a slight\ndetuning between laser and cavity are negligible owing to\nthe comparatively large cavity linewidth and we further\nquantify this statement in Appendix B.\nTo study the non-linear dynamics of this system we\nconsider a semi-classical approximation where all expectation values of more than one operator can be factorized,\n(j)\n(j)\ne.g. h\u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 i \u2248 h\u00e2\u2020 ih\u03c3\u0302\u2212 i.

Only the solution with the\nlargest intra-cavity intensity is shown. Near resonance there\nare two additional solutions (see Fig. 4). The white hyperbolas indicate the resonances of the weakly driven system.\n\nother hand, in the strong driving limit, Iin > C 2 /4, the\natomic transition is completely saturated and the cavity\nbehaves as if it were empty. In the intermediate regime,\n4C < Iin < C 2 /4, two stable solutions exist; a low intensity branch on which the atomic transition is unsaturated\nand a high intensity branch on which the atomic transition is saturated.\nTo clarify the connection of the physics considered here\nwith previous studies of optical bistability in cavity QED,\nit is useful to consider the intensity in the cavity as a\nfunction of \u2206 and \u03c9c \u2212 \u03c9L . One of the stable solutions\nfor the intra-cavity intensity is shown in Fig. 3. In the\nweak driving limit, Iin \u2192 0, the resonances of the system\napproach the white hyperbolas while the resonance of the\nstrongly driven system, Iin \u2192 \u221e, lies on the black horizontal line. Remarkably, with the axis rescaled as in that\nfigure, the plots depend only on two free parameters, C\nand Iin . Most experiments on optical bistability in cavity QED to date have been carried out in a regime where\nC/T2 \u001d \u03ba. For such an experiment, scanning \u03c9L with\n\u03c9a = \u03c9c corresponds to the nearly vertical dotted line in\nthis figure [13, 22]. In our proposal \u2206 is scanned while\n\u03c9c = \u03c9L at all times, corresponding to the black horizontal line. While the basic physics behind this non-linear\ncoupled system has been known for a long time [22], it\nhas not been interrogated in the way discussed here.\nThe spectra resulting from scanning \u2206 in this way are\nshown for weak, intermediate (i.e., bistable), and strong\npumping in Fig. 4. These spectra are cuts through\nthe plot in Fig. 3 along the \u2206 = 0 line. In the weak\npumping regime (dotted line) we see a broadened absorption feature with width CT2\u22121 . In the bistable regime\n(dashed line) there are three possible stationary values of\nthe intra-cavity intensity near resonance.

Quantum limited linewidth according to Eq. (A19) for several optical lattice clock systems. The cavity geometry\nis Veff = L \u00d7 (100 \u03bcm)2 and the finesse, F, is tuned to give N C0 ' 100. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is 1 Hz bandwidthnormalized. In all but the last case, T2 values have been set to be \u22641 s. This is a conservative estimate based on currentgeneration lattice clock experiments [23].\n\nThe shot-noise limited photocurrent noise has a white\npower spectrum and in the limit of PLO \u001d Psig , the mage2\nnitude is proportional to h\u03bd\nPLO . As a consequence, the\nfrequency noise power spectral density of the lock error,\nS\u03b4\u03bd , is white. We convert this quantity to conventional\nlaser linewidth (see e.g., [24, 25] and Appendix A) when\nthe system is locked and find that\n!2\nC0\n1\n\u2248\n\u03b2 .

For that system the linewidth\nis given by \u2206\u03bdlaser = C0 \u03b3/\u03c0. The atoms behave more\ncollectively in the case of the laser. At the peak of laser\nemission the collective dipole of the atoms is proportional\nPN\n\u2020\nto N , i.e., hJ\u02c6+ J\u02c6\u2212 i \u221d N 2 , where J\u02c6\u2212 = J\u02c6+\n= j=1 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 . In\ncontrast, for the passive spectroscopy considered here\n2\n\nN T2 \u03b3\nhJ\u02c6+ J\u02c6\u2212 i = 2\nC \u03b2\n\n(13)\n\non resonance, \u2206 = 0, i.e. the effective number of atoms\nthat participate in\n\u221a the collective dynamics is reduced by\na factor of order T2 \u03b3. Finally, we note that in the limit\nwhere there is no inhomogeneous broadening (T2 = 2/\u03b3),\nEqn. (A19) reduces to \u2206\u03bd = \u03b2C0 \u03b3/ (64\u03c0). This is, for \u03b2\nof order unity, the same scaling as in the laser case.\nTable I summarizes the stabilization performance that\ncan be achieved for several atomic species and transitions. In all these examples the parameters are chosen such that C \u2248 100. The mode volume of the\ncavity is Veff = L \u00d7 \u03c0(100\u03bcm)2 , where the length L\ndoes not enter the results. Furthermore, in this locking scheme, the quantum-limited lock bandwidth (beyond which the signal to noise drops below unity) is given\nby BWql = \u03baC 2 n0 \u03b2. In all cases considered, this fundamental limitation is well above the kHz range, indicating that the requisite level of laser pre-stabilization is\nwell within current technological capabilities. In several\nrealistic lattice clock systems, we find that laser stabilization can achieve quantum-limited performance at the\n\nmHz level without suffering from thermal noise. Finally,\nimprovements in the coherence time T2 of the narrowest\ntransitions yields reciprocal gains in the quantum-limited\nlocked-laser linewidth, underscoring the importance of\ninvestigating possible decoherence mechanisms for neutral atom lattice clocks beyond the 1 s time-scale.\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a laser stabilization\ntechnique based on strongly saturated spectroscopy of\nnarrow optical transitions that enables linewidths in the\n1 mHz range with current experimental technology. This\ntechnique is not limited by thermal noise and the fundamental limits of this scheme are below the 1\u03bcHz level.\nIn the future we plan to study alternative realizations of\nthis idea including atomic beams and trapped ions.\nWe thank J. K. Thompson and J. Cooper for valuable\ndiscussions.

As long as the laser is close to resonance, the\nphase is linear to a good approximation. Now we can\nidentify the effect of \u03b4i (t) on our ability to determine\nthe line center of the atomic resonance.\nUnder locked condition, the DC difference current,\nIdiff , is enforced to be zero via control of the laser frequency.
