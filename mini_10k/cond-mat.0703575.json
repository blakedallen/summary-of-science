D.

They also represent a serious challenge to statistical and continuum modeling, due\nto the small number of particles and dissipation. A fundamental understanding of granular systems, comparable\nto our current understanding of fluids and solids, does not\nexist today [1] but would have far reaching implications\nacross many industries.\nThe idealized granular system, a collection of identical\ninelastic hard spheres, is a laboratory scale analog of the\ncanonical system in kinetic theory - the elastic hard\nsphere gas. Using this analogy, an inelastic version of the\nBoltzmann-Enskog equation have be derived [2, 3] as well\nas an inelastic version of continuum equations for mass,\nmomentum, and energy balance [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] nearly\nidentical to the Navier-Stokes equations. These type of\nequations can produce a quantitative description of dilute\ngranular flows with an accuracy of 1% [9]. Boundary\nconditions for velocity and granular temperature have\n\nbeen derived to complete these equation [10, 11, 12, 13],\nwhich assume that the fluid never leaves the boundary.\nNormal fluids remain attached to boundaries due to\ntwo effects - adhesion and pressure (external and internal). External pressure is unimportant and adhesion\nis not present in non-cohesive granular materials leaving\nthe internal pressure alone to hold a granular fluid to a\nboundary. However, if the force on the granular fluid accelerates the fluid to a velocity greater than the average\nroot-mean-squared particle velocity (square root of the\ngranular temperature), then the boundary and the granular fluid will separate. This is the analog of cavitation\nin normal fluids. While cavitation is unusual in normal\nfluids, low granular temperature at boundaries due to inelastic loss combined with the lack of external pressure\nand adhesion makes cavitation common in granular fluids\n(see Fig. 1). Common examples include rotating drums\nand vibrated layers. Many features of pattern formation\nin vibrated layers [14] can be understood in terms of the\ntime that the layer spends off of the plate [15]. It difficult to explain this dependence with models which do\nnot allow the granular fluid to leave the boundary.\n\nII.\n\nNEW BOUNDARY CONDITION\n\nThe standard boundary condition [10, 11, 12, 13] for\nthe velocity normal to the wall is\n(u \u2212 v) * n\u0302 = 0,\n\nFIG. 1: photographs of a 2D granular layer under free fall\nconditions (top row) and vibrated (bottom row). The layer\nis initially in contact with the boundary (first column), but\nthen moves away (second and third column).\n\n\u2217 shattuck@ccny.cuny.edu;\n\nURL: http://gibbs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu\n\n(1)\n\nfor the fluid velocity u on a boundary with inward unit\nnormal n\u0302 and wall velocity v. In order to enforce this condition the boundary must exert a force Fb on the granular fluid. Because there is no attractive force between\nthe grains and the boundary Fb * n\u0302 \u2265 0. When the force\nneeded to maintain zero velocity is negative the boundary condition must be changed. Since the boundary force\nthen must be zero a no stress condition n\u0302 * P * n = 0 is the\nlogical choice. As the normal wall velocity will no longer\nbe zero we must have a another condition to enforce the\nno particle flux condition at the boundary. Analytically\n\n\f2\n\nPlunger Position (mm)\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime (ms)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 2: Plot showing the lower boundary of the vibrated\nsystem as a function of time. 94 cycles at 10Hz are overlaid.\nThe horizontal line shows the diameter of a particle.\n\nmore work needs to be done\nto understand this new conR\ndition on the flux \u03a6 = \u03c1u * dS. Numerically, we treat\nthe density and velocity as centered in the grid and the\nflux is defined on the boundaries of the grid. In that case\nthe density and velocity in the cell nearest the boundary\nare both non-zero, but the flux on the wall is zero (see\n(\u00a7 IV) for details of the flux condition). Altogether we\nhave\n\u001a\n(u \u2212 v) * n\u0302 = 0\nif\nFb * n\u0302 > 0\n(2)\nn\u0302 * P * n = 0, \u03a6 = 0 else Fb * n\u0302 \u2264 0.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe have performed two types of experiments to elucidate the role of boundary conditions in continuum equations of motion for granular materials - free-fall and\nvibrated. We place N (51\u2013117) spherical stainless steel\nball bearings of diameter D = 3.175 mm in a container\n17.5 D wide by 20 D tall by 1 D deep as shown in Fig.\n1. We define the number of rows R = N/17, where 17\nis the number of particles to fill an entire row in a closepacked structure. We control a thin plunger, which slides\nthrough a slot in the bottom of the cell. For the free-fall\nexperiment [Fig. 1(top row)] the plunger pushes all of the\nparticle to the top of the cell to start the experiment. The\nparticles are then vibrated in order to compact them into\na perfect hexagonal packing [Fig. 1(top-left)]. Then the\nplunger is pulled downward with an initial acceleration of\n4g, where g is the acceleration of gravity. The particles\nare then free to fall under gravity. This process is under computer control and can be repeated many times.\nIn the vibrated experiments [Fig. 1(bottom row)] the\nplunger oscillates sinusoidally, but is offset from the bottom of the container to produce a half-sine-wave excitation. The measured position of the plate is shown in Fig.\n2. 94 oscillations are superimposed to show the repeata-\n\nFIG. 3: Color online: Steps in the spatial and temporal averaging process for density field. (top) Modified Voronoi cells,\n(middle) footprint preserving spatial average over 2 particle\ndiameters, (bottom) average over phase (time).\n\nbility of the drive. The excitation is characterized by the\nnon-dimensional maximum acceleration \u0393 = A(2\u03c0f )2 /g,\nwhere A is the maximum amplitude of the plunger and\nf is the frequency. Using high-speed digital photography\nwe measure the positions of the plunger and all of the\nparticles in the cell with a relative accuracy of 0.2% of\nD or approximately 6\u03bcm at a rate of 840 Hz. We track\nthe particles from frame to frame and assign a velocity\nto each one, typically \u223c D/5 per frame.\nTo compare with the continuum theories through our\nsimulations (see Section IV), we must average the particle trajectories to created density, velocity, and temperature fields. We are interested in studying the flow as\nthe grains separate from the boundary so we focus on\nthe density fields. To create average fields we run each\nflow condition 90-100 times. In each frame, we construct\na modified Voronoi cell around each particle and fill it\nwith a uniform number density of 1 particle divided by\nthe area of the cell. We modify the Voronoi cells on the\nborder by including only the area that overlaps with a\nsector created by two lines both tangent to the particles\nedge and tangent to two other neighbors less than two\nparticle diameters away. This is the union of the convex hull formed by all all particle pairs whose centers lie\nwithin 2 particle diameters of each other. The results of\nsuch a construction are shown in Fig. 3(top). Next, we\napply a mask preserving spatial average over 2 particle\ndiameters [Fig. 3(middle)]. The mask is formed by the\nunion of all of the modified voronoi cells. Finally, we bin\nthe frames according the phase of the cycle and average\neach bin [Fig. 3(bottom)]. From these images we have\ndetermined that the flow is uniform in the horizontal x\ndirection for both free-fall and vibrations. Therefore, x\n\n\f3\nto obtain one dimension density field along the vertical\nz direction. Space-time intensity plots of these densities\nare shown in Fig. 4.\nAs a further quantitative comparison, we calculated\nthe discharge rate for the free-fall case [Fig. 5(a)] and\nthe acceleration of the center of mass aCM minus g for\nall cases [Fig. 5(b\u2013d)]. M (aCM \u2212 g) = Fb , where M\nis the total mass of the fluid. In Fig. 5(b\u2013d) we plot\nab = 1/M Fb * \u1e91 = (aCM \u2212 g) * \u1e91 for both the free fall and\nthe vibrating case.\nIV.\n\nSIMULATION\n\nWe numerically integrate the continuum equations for\nthe balance of mass, momentum, and energy have been\nderived for two-dimensional (2D) granular flows [3, 16]:\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1u) = 0\n\u2202t\n\u2202u\n+ u * \u2207u) = \u2212\u2207 * P \u2212 g\n\u03c1(\n\u2202t\n\u2202T\n\u03c1(\n+ u * \u2207T ) = \u2212\u2207 * q \u2212 P : E \u2212 \u03b3,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the mass density, g is the gravity vector, T\nis the granular temperature, q is the heat flux vector,\nEij = 21 (\u2202i uj +\u2202j ui ) are the elements of the symmetrized\nvelocity gradient tensor E, and \u03b3 is the temperature loss\nrate. The constitutive relations for the pressure tensor P\nand heat flux q are\nP = (P \u2212 2\u03bbTrE)I \u2212 2\u03bc(E \u2212 (TrE)I)\n\n(6)\n\nq = \u2212\u03ba\u2207T,\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\nwhere Tr denotes trace and I is the unit tensor. The 2D\nequations close [16] with the equation of state, which is\nthe ideal gas equation of state with a term that includes\ndense gas and inelastic effects,\nP = \u03c1T [1 + (1 + e)G(\u03bd)],\n\n(8)\n2\n\nwhere e is the coefficient of restitution, \u03bd = \u03c1\u03c0\u03c3\n4m is the\nvolume fraction, \u03c3 is the diameter of the particles, m\nis the mass of the particles, and G(\u03bd) = \u03bdg(\u03bd, \u03c3), where\ng(\u03bd, \u03c3) is the value of the radial distribution function at a\ndistance of one particle diameter. We use a temperature\ndependent\n(\np\n1/5\nif T < T0\n(9)\ne(T ) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 e0 ) T /T0\ne0\notherwise.\nThis mimics the experimental evidence that e0 goes to\nzero for small velocities. We use a form for G(\u03bd) developed by Torquato [17], which is an analytical fit to\nmolecular dynamics simulation at high \u03bd and the Carnahan and Starling [18] geometric series approximation to\n\nthe first few viral coefficients at low \u03bd. We have changed\nthe functional form of G(\u03bd) and the details of the flow\nchange, but not the qualitative behavior.

We\nuse off-center-differencing at the boundaries to maintain\nsecond-order accuracy. The code uses an adaptive time\nstep based on a modified Courant condition combined\nwith an empirically determined maximum and minimum\ntime step. We used a 5x161 point x-z grid, with periodic\nboundary conditions in the x direction. We use the temperature and tangential velocity boundary condition for\nsmooth surfaces found in reference [12]. We can alternate\nbetween our new (2) and the standard v * n\u0302 = 0 boundary conditions for the normal velocity. To maintain mass\nconservation we use a special differencing procedure for\nthe mass continuity equation, which is second-order accurate for both the new and old boundary conditions and\nis exactly conserving. In one dimension we label the density and velocity \u03c1i and wi for i = 0 to N . We then define\nN + 2 fluxes \u03a6i = (\u03c1i\u22121 + \u03c1i )(wi\u22121 + wi )/4 for i = 1 to\nN , and \u03a60 = \u03a6N +1 = 0. Then the change in density at\nposition zi = i\u2206z is \u2206\u03c1i = (\u03a6i+1 \u2212 \u03a6i )\u2206t, where \u2206t is\nthe current time step. From these definitions it follows\nP\nPN\nthat N\ni=0 \u2206\u03c1i = 0 and\ni=0 \u03c1i = constant, regardless\nof the value of w and \u03c1 at the boundaries. The only\nboundaries in the system are the actual walls. We let\nthe free surfaces develop on there own simply as very low\ndensity regions. As the density of a gas becomes so dilute\nthat the mean free path is comparable to the size of the\ncontainer the transport equations must be modified. We\ndefine a transport cutoff at a density of\n\u03bd0 =\n\n1\n\u221a = 5.89x10\u22123,\n6l0 2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere l0 = 20 is the dimensionless cutoff mean free path.\nAt lower densities than this the viscosity and thermal\nconductivity are multiplied by the factor\n\u03c7=\n\n\u03bd02\n\n\u03bd2\n.\n+ \u03bd2\n\n(15)\n\n\fPosition (mm)\n\n4\n\n0\n\u221210\n\u221220 a)\n\nPosition (mm)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n\n80\n\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\nTime (ms)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nb)\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n20\n\n40 60 80\nTime (ms)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFIG. 4: Color online: Space-time plots of the volume fraction for a) free-fall and b) vibrated. Experiments are shown in the\nfirst column, simulations with the new boundary conditions in the the second column, and simulations with the old boundary\nconditions in the third column. In a) the upper white line is the top of the cell. The lower line show where the number flux\nis calculated in Fig. 5(a). In b) the line is the position of the bottom plunger. The separation of the fluid from the plate can\nclearly be seen in the experiment and the simulation using the new boundary conditions.\n\nFor \u03bd >> \u03bd0 \u03c7 is close to unity, but as the density decreases the transport coefficients go smoothly to zero.\nThis ad-hoc factor is used only to prevent the code from\ndiverging at extremely low densities. In these simulations, we have varied from 10-100 and the results are\nalmost the same except for slight deviations in the very\nlow-density regions. This low density regime does not effect the main flow as the momentum and energy are also\nnearly zero unless the temperature or velocity diverge,\nwhich is prevented by this approach.\nWe use the following parameter for all of the simulations presented here: e0 = 0.7 and T 0 = 1. Both of these\nparameter effect the energy loss. If the energy loss is not\ngreat enough the separation does not occur. These values\nwere not formally optimized, but several different value\nof e0 between 0.6 and 0.9 were tried, but anything below 0.8 gave approximately the same flight-time for the\nvibrated case. The temperature and tangential velocity\nboundary conditions require two additional parameters,\new = .5 and \u03bcw = 0, the wall coefficients of restitution\nand friction. These parameters only have a small effect\non the flow.\nFor the free-fall case we solve the equation in the lab\nframe. To create an initial condition we set gravity upwards to push the fluid to the top of the container. Then\nwe slowly decrease gravity to zero and then abruptly\n\nchange the value of g to \u2212g. The results of the horizontally averaged density are shown as space-time plots\nin Fig. 4 for both the new and old boundary conditions.\nFor the vibrated case we solve the problem in the reference frame of the bottom plate. We determine the acceleration of the plate from the experimentally determined\nposition of the plate Fig. 2. The second derivative is\nquite noisy so the signal is convolved with a 5 ms tophat function. The signal is then corrected so that the\naverage acceleration is zero. The initial condition is a\nuniform distribution and wait for the density to reach a\nstable periodic state. This typically takes 5-10 oscillations. The final cycle is shown in Fig. 4 for both types\nof boundary conditions.\n\nV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nComparing the first two columns in Fig. 4 (experiment and new boundary conditions) to the third there\nis a striking effect. In the free-fall experiment the zero\nvelocity boundary condition holds the fluid to the top\nsurface long after all of the grains in the experiment and\nthe new boundary condition simulation have left the domain of interest. To see this in a quantitative way we look\nat the rate the particles pass the lower line in the figure.\n\n\f1\n\n6\n\na)\nAcceleration in (g)\n\nNumber Flux (particles/ms)\n\n5\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n\u22123\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nTime in ms\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n0.1\nAcceleration in (g)\n\n0.05\n0\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime in ms\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.2\nc)\n\nAcceleration in (g)\n\nb)\n\n0.1\n0\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\nd)\n\n\u22120.4\n20\n\n40\nTime in ms\n\n60\n\n\u22120.5\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nTime in ms\n\n80\n\nFIG. 5: Comparison of experiment (connected points) and simulation with new boundary conditions (solid) and old boundary\nconditions (dashed) for free-fall (a,c) and vibration (b,d). Plots of a) Number flux of particles passing the lower horizontal line\nin Fig. 4(a) as a function of time and b-d) acceleration of the center of mass of the granular fluid.\n\nThe result is shown in Fig. 5(a). Initially the two simulation follow more closely due to the lack of dispersion in\nthe experiment. The dispersion in the simulation is not\ndue to temperature, but an artifact of the truncation error in the mass conservation equations. Shortly ( 20 ms)\nall three curves meet, but by ( 30 ms) the old boundary\nconditions simulation begins to diverge, and from there\non the behavior is radically different. As the last of the\nmaterial flows from the experiment and new BC simulation there is another small lag, but the old BC simulation\ncontinues to flow for another 30 ms. Figure 5(c) shows\nthat there is a negative acceleration induced by the old\nBCs. Both the experiment and the new BCs show zero\nacceleration throughout the time of the experiment.\n\nIn Fig. 4(b) the layer is stuck to the boundary for the\nold BCs. There is no clear flight time. From the layer\nacceleration ab in Fig. 5(b) we see that there is still some\nkind of a collision for the old BCs but it occurs earlier.\nFurther, there is a clear region of negative acceleration, as\nseen in the expanded axis of Fig. 5(d) of nearly half the\nvalue of gravity. The small negative acceleration in the\nexperiment is likely due to friction with the walls. The\ntake off time and collision time shown by the two vertical\nline are the same for the experiment and the new BCs.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe new boundary conditions provide a significant improvement in simulating these flows. Separation (cavitation) is a very common situation in granular flows,\nand this type of boundary condition is needed to capture the basic features of the flows presented. Without\nthis type of boundary condition many qualitative features\nmay be missed, and there is no hope quantitative agreement. There are still a number of open question including: what should happen in corners, and how can these\nBCs be treated analytically? Previously we have shown\nthat molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [19, 20] are\ncapable of quantitatively reproducing the flow in dense\nvibrated pattern forming system, and MD and continuum\nsimulation can reproduce dilute flows in which granular\nshocks form [9]. However, this work represents a first, big\nstep in getting quantitative agreement using continuum\nsimulations in dense vibrated pattern forming systems.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by The National Science Foundation, Math, Physical Sciences Department of Materials\n\n\f6\nResearch under the Faculty Early Career Development\n\n[1] L.
