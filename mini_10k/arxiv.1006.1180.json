Introduction\nCoordinate transformation optics (hereafter referred to as transformation optics) is a recently\nintroduced concept for tailoring electromagnetic waves to achieve certain desirable\ncharacteristics via the use of specially designed metamaterials [1]. The technique is based on\nthe form-invariance of Maxwell's equations under smooth and differentiable coordinate\ntransformations [2]. The mathematically defined transformations are cast into corresponding\nchanges of constitutive material parameters and consequently, of electromagnetic entities,\nsuch as electromagnetic fields, currents, and charge distributions. The invisibility cloak has\nbeen proposed [1] as an innovative example of this, and many related studied both\nexperimental [3] and theoretical, have been proposed. In addition to cloaking devices,\nincluding the carpet cloak [4], acoustic [5] and matter wave [6] cloaks and an anti-cloak [7],\nother interesting concepts of coordinate transformation optics such as adaptive beam bands\nand beam expanders [8], field concentrators [9], source transformation devices [10], and\nillusion optical devices [11] have been reported as well.\nFrom a topological view point, transformation optics can be categorized into two types. In\nthe first type of transformation, the spatial domain of the transformation is ideally localized\nwithin a finite space: in other words, the interaction of light waves with the transformed\nregion is designed to be seen as if there is a localized object such as free-space (invisibility\ncloak), ground mirror (carpet cloak) or other object (illusion optics). Therefore, the properties\nof outgoing light waves from such transformed media, at least in ideal cases, recover those of\ntheir original states. In contrast, another type of transformation optical device has been\nproposed, i.e. finite-embedded coordinate transformation optical devices [12]. In this type of\ntransformation, the metrics of space are not necessarily recovered into those of the original\nspace. In many cases, the main objective of transformed optical media is to modify the\noutgoing wave fronts. The beam shifter and divider [12], and beam expander [8] are examples\nof this.\nThe concept of finite-embedded coordinate transformation optics has stimulated some\ninterest in the reflection conditions at the interfaces between transformed and untransformed\nmedia. Due to some slight vagueness in the reflectionless condition between these media\nsuggested in the original introductory paper [12], the issue of the necessary and/or sufficient\nconditions for finite-embedded media to be transparent has been discussed [8, 13-17]. The\nnon-reflecting condition derived in Ref. [13] covers three-dimensionally transformed media\nwith non-planar boundaries. The derived condition given in Eq. (11) in Ref. [13] states that if\nthe boundary coordinate in the transformed medium can be expressed as the rotation of the\noriginal space with a constant displacement vector added, then the boundary is non-reflecting.\nHowever, in this report we will show that a non-reflecting coordinate transformed boundary\ncan exist for a skewed-and-expanded transformation (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 4) which cannot\nbe covered by Eq. (11) in Ref. [13]. Another general study on the boundary conditions for\ngeneralized transformed media was also reported [14]. Although our study is restricted to\nmore specific cases of extended two-dimensional problems, we provide more explicit\nconditions and illustrative examples throughout this paper which were not addressed in Ref.\n[14]. Recently, studies on the mapping method that can make the two-dimensional\ntransformation optical slab transparent in a general way have been reported [15-17]. However,\nthe discussions concerning this are limited only to cases of two-dimensionally transformed\nmedia and cannot deal with extended two-dimensional cases which are treated in this paper\n(see Section 4 and Fig. 5).\nIn this work, the non-reflecting boundary conditions of a finite-embedded coordinate\ntransformed metamaterial slab will be explored. For the sake of simplicity, we imposed two\nrestrictions in our study. The first one is that the mapping function of the coordinate\ntransformation is not z-dependent, except for z ' , which can be x- and y-dependent. This is\nmore general than the two-dimensional transformations treated in Refs. [15-17]. As will be\n\n\fseen in this study, this is not a straightforward extension of the two-dimensional case and care\nmust be taken in deriving the non-reflecting condition. We also assumed that the incident field\nis defined in two-dimensional conventions, i.e., we excluded conical incidence. With this\nassumption, the dispersion relation in the transformed media can be given in a very simple\nform. The governing equation which makes transformed media transparent will be presented,\nalong with details of the derivation procedure. Several examples, including known mapping\nfunctions in several literatures as well as some novel ones, will be discussed with numerical\nimplementations. A discussion of the design of some novel transformed optical devices are\nalso presented.\n2. Derivation of the governing equation\nIn this section, we start with the basics of the coordinate transformation in a Cartesian\ncoordinate system and derive an equation which describes the non-reflecting boundaries in\ntwo-dimensional finite-embedded coordinate transformation media (CTM). Let us consider a\ncoordinate transformation in a Cartesian coordinate system, which maps the points in the\noriginal space (or the virtual space) ( x, y, z ) to those in the physical space (or the transformed\nspace) ( x ', y ', z ') as follows:\n( x ', y ', z ') \uf03d ( F ( x, y, z ), G ( x, y, z ), H ( x, y, z )),\n(1)\nwhere F, G, and H are the mapping functions of the coordinate transformation. We further\nassume that the mapping functions in Eq. (1) can have an inverse transformation.\nNow let us consider the case where this CTM is finitely embedded as in Fig. 1. We\nassume that the material parameters in the original space can be different from those of the\nsurrounding media in the physical space. As depicted in Fig. 1, the transformed medium\n(region II) fills a finite-extent of the physical space and the material parameters of both sides\nof the transformed medium (region I and III) can also be different.\ny'\n\ny\nII\n\nI\n\n\uf065 0\uf065 I , \uf06d0 \uf06d I \uf065 0\uf065 II m ', \uf06d0 \uf06d II m ' \uf065 0\uf065 III , \uf06d0 \uf06d III\n\n\uf065 0\uf065 II , \uf06d0 \uf06d II\nd1\n\nIII\n\nd2\n\nx\n\nd1 '\n\nd2 '\n\nx'\n\nFig. 1. Geometrical representation of a finite-embedded coordinate transformation.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we further assume that the mapping functions in Eq. (1) are\ndefined in a sort of extended two-dimensional convention such that\nF ( x, y, z ) \uf03d F ( x, y ), G ( x, y, z ) \uf03d G ( x, y ), H ( x, y, z ) \uf03d h( x, y ) z.\n\n(2)\n\nThis means that the mapping functions are not z-dependent except for z ' which can be x- and\ny-dependent by the scale factor h( x, y ) : this is the reason why we refer to this mapping\nextended two-dimensional.\nFrom the form-invariance of Maxwell's equations, the material tensors in virtual space\nm can be re-expressed in the physical space as m ' with the following relation [1]:\nmi ' j ' \uf03d Aii ' Ajj ' mij / det( Aii ' ),\n(3)\n\n\fwhere m and m ' denote either the permittivity or the permeability tensor and Aii ' is the\nelement of the transformation Jacobian matrix defined as\nAii ' \uf03d \uf0b6xi ' / \uf0b6xi .\n(4)\nThrough this paper, we assume that the material in the virtual space is isotropic and\nhomogeneous so that the material parameters in the original space can be expressed\nas \uf065 \uf03d \uf065 0\uf065 r and \uf06d \uf03d \uf06d0 \uf06dr . Under this condition, the material tensor in transformed space can\nbe defined as \uf065 \uf03d \uf065 0\uf065 r m ' and \uf06d \uf03d \uf06d0 \uf06d r m ' with m ' \uf03d AAt / det( A) where A is the Jacobian\nmatrix and the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose.\nNow suppose that the material tensor m ' can be expressed as\n\uf0e9a b c \uf0f9\n(5)\nm ' \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0ea b d e \uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0eb\uf0ea c e f \uf0fb\uf0fa\nand its matrix inverse \uf028 m '\uf029 is given as\n\uf02d1\n\n\uf028 m '\uf029\n\n\uf02d1\n\n\uf0e9 (df \uf02d e 2 ) \uf02d(bf \uf02d ce) (be \uf02d cd ) \uf0f9\n1\uf0ea\n\uf0fa 1\n\uf03d \uf0ea \uf02d(bf \uf02d ce) (af \uf02d c 2 ) \uf02d(ae \uf02d bc) \uf0fa \uf03d \uf0e9\uf0eb \uf044 ji \uf0f9\uf0fb ,\n\uf044\n\uf044\n\uf0ea (be \uf02d cd ) \uf02d( ae \uf02d bc) (ad \uf02d b 2 ) \uf0fa\n\uf0eb\n\uf0fb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \uf044ij is the matrix cofactor and \uf044 is the determinant of m ' given as\n\uf044 \uf03d adf \uf02d ae 2 \uf02d b 2 f \uf02d c 2 d \uf02b 2bce\n\n(7)\n\nfrom the coordinate transformation results shown in Eq.

(5) into\nMaxwell's equations with time dependency of exp(\uf02d j\uf077 t ) gives the following wave equation\nin a matrix form:\nk02\n(8)\nSE \uf02b k02 n 2 E \uf03d 0,\n\uf0442\nwhere E is a column vector of ( Ex , E y , Ez ) , n is the refractive index of the original material,\n\nnII2 \uf03d \uf065 II \uf06d II , and k0 is the free-space wavenumber. The system matrix S in Eq.

From the\ncondition that Eq. (8) has a non-trivial solution, the determinant of (S / \uf044 2 \uf02b n 2 I) , where I is\nthe identity matrix, should be zero. Therefore, we arrive at the following dispersion relation\nfor this transformed media\n(10)\nnII2 (\uf02d\uf044 n II2 \uf02b a\uf06b x2, II \uf02b d \uf06b y2 \uf02b f \uf06b z2 \uf02b 2b\uf06bx , II \uf06b y \uf02b 2c\uf06b z \uf06b x , II \uf02b 2e\uf06b y\uf06b z ) 2 / \uf044 2 \uf03d 0.\nFor simplicity, we assume that the incident plane wave arising from region I has k z \uf03d 0 .\nUnder this assumption and for a non-zero n, the dispersion relation in Eq. (10) can be\nexpressed with cofactor elements as:\n2\n\uf044 33 (\uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y ) 2 \uf03d \uf044 22 nII2 \uf044 2 \uf02b \uf044 22 (\uf044 23\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04413\uf06b y ) 2 \uf02d \uf044 33 (\uf04411\uf044 22 \uf02d \uf04412\n)\uf06b y2 . (11)\nIn general, the transformed medium in region II is inhomogeneous and anisotropic and thus,\ncannot be approximated efficiently using simple models such as a stair-case approximation.\nTherefore, we restrict our analysis to those cases in which the variations in the material\n\n\fparameters in the transformed space are smooth and differentiable. Furthermore, since our\ninterest is to attempt to determine conditions that make this finite slab of CTM reflectionless,\nmultiple reflections can be ignored. As a consequence, we can consider the reflections at each\ninterface ( x ' \uf03d d1 ' and x ' \uf03d d 2 ' ) separately as if they are single interfaces. In addition, when\nwe obtain the reflectionless condition at the first boundary ( x ' \uf03d d1 ' ), the condition required\nfor reflectance of the second boundary ( x ' \uf03d d 2 ' ) to be zero can be obtained very easily, i.e.,\nwe can adopt the condition obtained at the first boundary with an appropriate change in\nmaterial parameters from I to III.\nFrom an analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this transformed media under the\nassumption of a plane monochromatic wave, it is apparent that the TE- and TM-polarized\nfields are eigen-bases of this transformed material. Therefore, we can decompose the problem\ninto TE- and TM-polarized cases. Now let us consider the reflectance of the TM-polarized\nplane monochromatic wave [ E \uf03d ( Ex , E y , 0) and H \uf03d (0, 0, H z ) ] incident on the first boundary.\nThe magnetic field components in the immediate vicinity of the first boundary are readily\nexpressed as\n(12)\nH z , I \uf03d exp[ j (k x , I x \uf02b k y y )] \uf02b r exp[ j (\uf02d k x , I x \uf02b k y y )],\n(13)\nH z , II \uf03d t exp[ j (k x , II x \uf02b k y y )],\nwhere r and t are complex coefficients of the reflectance and the transmittance, respectively.\nFrom Maxwell's equations, the tangential electric field in region I can be easily obtained as\nk\n(14)\nE y , I \uf03d x , I {exp[ j (k x , I x \uf02b k y y )] \uf02d r exp[ j (\uf02d k x , I x \uf02b k y y )]}.\nk0 \uf065 I\nThe tangential electric field in region II can be obtained similarly with the material parameters\ngiven in Eq. (5) as\n\uf044 22 k x , II \uf02d \uf04412 k y\n(15)\nE y , II \uf03d\nt exp[ j ( k x , II x \uf02b k y y )].\nk0\uf065 II \uf044\nFrom the continuity of the tangential components of the electromagnetic field at the boundary,\nwe have\n\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I \uf02d \uf065 I (\uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y )\n(16)\nr\uf03d\n,\n\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I \uf02b \uf065 I (\uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y )\nt\uf03d\n\n2\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I\n\n\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I \uf02b \uf065 I (\uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y )\nTherefore, to make r zero, we have\n\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I \uf03d \uf065 I ( \uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y ).\n\n.\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nTo make the medium reflectionless for all incidence angles (i.e. for arbitrary values of k y ), Eq.\n(18) should be satisfied for the arbitrary values of k y . Considering Eqs. (11) and (18), we find\nthat such conditions can be fulfilled only if the following condition is satisfied by the\ncoordinate transformation (see the Appendix):\n(19)\n( Axx ' Ayz ' \uf02d Ayx ' Axz ' )( Axx ' Axz ' \uf02b Ayx ' Ayz ' ) \uf03d 0.\nWhen Eq. (19) is satisfied, the condition for which the extended two-dimensional finite\nembedded coordinate medium is non-reflecting can be obtained as (see the Appendix):\n\uf044 222 \uf06d II2 \uf03d \uf044 33 \uf06d I2 ,\n(20)\nwhich can be expressed in Jacobian elements as\n(21)\n( Azz ' ) 2 [( Axx ' ) 2 \uf02b ( Ayx ' ) 2 ]2 \uf06d II2 \uf03d ( Axx ' Ayy ' \uf02d Ayx ' Axy ' )4 \uf06d I2 ,\nand further simplified in an altemate form as\n( Azz ' )[( Axx ' ) 2 \uf02b ( Ayx ' ) 2 ] \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072 ( Axx ' Ayy ' \uf02d Ayx ' Axy ' ) 2 ,\n(22)\n\n\fwhere \uf072 \uf03d \uf06d I / \uf06d II .\nThe condition for the second interface can be readily obtained by changing \uf06d I in Eq. (20)\nwith \uf06d III :\n2\n\uf044 222 \uf06d II2 \uf03d \uf04433 \uf06d III\n.\n\n(23)\n\nLet us consider the case \uf06d I 2 \uf0b9 \uf06d III 2 . Even for this case, we can still generally say that the\nboundaries can be made non-reflecting when the mapping function at each boundary satisfies\nthe conditions in Eq. (20) or (23) separately and the mapping functions in between change\nsmoothly. Under this condition, and from the duality for the TE-polarized case, we have the\nfollowing form for the condition for the non-reflecting boundary:\n( Azz ' )[( Axx ' ) 2 \uf02b ( Ayx ' ) 2 ] \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072i ( Axx ' Ayy ' \uf02d Ayx ' Axy ' ) 2 .\n(24)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere \uf072i \uf03d \uf065 i / \uf065 II for TE- and \uf072i \uf03d \uf06di / \uf06d II for TM-mode light waves and i denotes either I or\nIII and we used the notation\n\ni\n\nto distinguish left and right boundaries.\n\nIn fact, the solution sets that satisfy Eq. (20) are not identical to those satisfying Eq. (18):\nin squaring Eq. (18), another set of solutions is introduced. In fact, this latter set of solutions\nmakes the denominator of Eq. (16) or (17) zero, which physically means that these solutions\nare those for the excitation of the waveguide mode propagating along the y-direction with a\npropagation constant k y satisfying the squared form of Eq. (18). In practical situations, the\nexcited waveguide modes under the condition of Eq. (21) are surface modes (formed only\nwhen the two media (I and II) have opposite signs for permittivity or permeability) which can\nbe excited by the incidence of evanescent waves. Therefore, if we exclude this specific case of\nsurface wave excitation that requires both opposite signs and the incidence of evanescent\nwaves, the conditions in Eq. (24) can be regarded as necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nnon-reflecting boundary. Otherwise, these conditions become necessary ones to make the\nfinite-embedded CTM non-reflecting.\nIn Eq. (24), the \uf0b1 sign means that the signs of the material parameters between the\ntransformed and the background media can be freely selectable. However, as stated above,\nchoosing opposite signs can result in the excitation of the surface waves at the interface, and if\nit is not inevitable, selecting the same sign as the surrounding media (i.e., choosing + in Eq.\n(24)) is recommended.\nEquation (24) can be used as a guideline for the design of a planar finite-embedded CTM\ninterface. Since the differential equation given in Eq. (24) is quite general, providing a general\nsolution is difficult. Instead, we will explore several simple test solutions and show the utility\nand validity of the derived conditions in the next sections.\n3. Two-dimensional examples\n\nThe simplest example satisfying Eq. (19) is the case where the transformation is totally twodimensional:\n(25)\nAxz ' \uf03d Ayz ' \uf03d 0.\nFor this case, we can assume that the mapping functions given in Eq. (1) can be expressed in\nthe following forms:\n(26)\nx '( x, y ) \uf03d A( x) \uf02b B( y ) \uf02b F ( x)G ( y ) \uf02b c1 ,\n(27)\ny '( x, y ) \uf03d C ( x) \uf02b D( y ) \uf02b H ( x) K ( y ) \uf02b c2 ,\n(28)\nz '( x, y ) \uf03d c3 z ,\nwhere ci ( i \uf03d 1, 2,3 ) are constants.\nBy substituting Eqs. (26)-(28) into (24) we have\nc3 [( Ax \uf02b Fx G ) 2 \uf02b ( By \uf02b FGy ) 2 ] \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072i [( Ax \uf02b Fx G )( Dy \uf02b HK y ) \uf02d ( By \uf02b FGy )(Cx \uf02b H x K )]2 , (29)\ni\n\ni\n\n\fwhere\n\ni\n\ndenotes the left and right boundaries and the subscript \uf068 means the partial\n\nderivative for the variable \uf068 , i.e., X \uf068 \uf03d \uf0b6X ( x, y ) / \uf0b6\uf068 for \uf068 \uf03d x or y. In following sub-sections,\nwe consider several examples for the mapping functions given in Eqs. (26)-(28).\n3.1. Beam shifter and beam expander\nThe beam shifter and expander based on coordinate transformation optics are shown\nschematically in Fig. 2.\n\n(a )\n\ny'\n\nd\n\nd\n\n(b )\n\nx'\n\ny'\n\nx'\n\nFig. 2. Geometrical representation of the beam shifter and expander.\n\nThe mapping function of the beam shifter in its simple form can be found in Ref. [12] and is\ngiven as follows:\nx ' \uf03d x, y ' \uf03d y \uf02b tan \uf071 x, z ' \uf03d c3 z ,\n(30)\nwhere the upper and lower limits in the transformed region are ignored, for the simplicity of\nthe discussion.\nBy comparing the conventions given in Eqs. (26)-(28), we can set\nA( x) \uf03d x, F ( x) \uf03d 1, C ( x) \uf03d x tan \uf071 , D( y ) \uf03d y, K ( y ) \uf03d 1,\n(31)\nwith other functions not specified in Eq. (31) so as to all be zero. Substituting these in Eq. (29)\ngives\nc3 \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072i .\n(32)\nFor the case of c3 \uf03d 1 , this result supports the widely-known fact that if the impedance of the\nmedium in the virtual space for the given polarization is matched to those of the background\nmedia in the physical space, the shift transformation causes no reflection at the boundary [12].\nLet us turn our attention to the beam expander. The simplest form of the mapping\nfunction for the beam expander can be given as [8]\nx ' \uf03d x, y ' \uf03d m( x) y, z ' \uf03d c3 z ,\n(33)\nwhere the magnification coefficient m( x) is assumed to have values of 1 and a constant value\nM at the first (x = 0) and second (x = d) boundaries, respectively. In a simple implementation,\nthe x-dependent magnification coefficient can be defined in a linear function of x as follows:\nm( x) \uf03d ( M \uf02d 1)( x \uf02d d ) / d \uf02b M ,\n(34)\nwhere d is the x-directional thickness of the transformed region.\nFrom Eqs. (26)-(28), we can set:\nA( x) \uf03d x, F ( x) \uf03d 1, H ( x) \uf03d m( x), K ( y ) \uf03d y,\n(35)\nwith other functions that are not specified as zero. Substituting these in Eq. (29) gives,\nc3 \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072i [m( xi )]2 .\n(36)\nFrom the definition that c3 is a constant, the above result implies that, if the square of the\nmagnification factor m( x) at the boundaries becomes different from \uf0b1 c3 / \uf072i , the coordinate\nexpansion in the transversal direction (along y-direction) will cause reflections. Therefore, to\n\n\fmake the interfaces non-reflecting, regions I and III should be filled with material that can\nsatisfy Eq. (36).\n\n3.2. Rotated and skewed-and-expanded transformation\nNow let us consider another example in which the mapping functions in Eqs. (26)-(28) have\nthe form of the combined characteristics of the longitudinal and transversal expansions. We\nwill examine a simple mapping function given as\nx ' \uf03d \uf061 x \uf02b \uf062 y, y ' \uf03d \uf063 x \uf02b \uf064 y, z ' \uf03d z,\n(37)\nwhere \uf061 , \uf062 , \uf063 , and \uf064 are all non-zero constants. From the conventions in Eqs. (26)-(28), we\nhave the following:\nA( x) \uf03d \uf061 x, B( y ) \uf03d \uf062 y, C ( x) \uf03d \uf063 x, D( y ) \uf03d \uf064 y,\n(38)\nwith the other functions and constants not specified as zero. From the condition of Eq. (29) we\nhave\n(39)\n(\uf061 2 \uf02b \uf062 2 ) \uf03d (\uf061\uf064 \uf02d \uf062\uf063 ) 2 ,\nwhere we assumed that the impedances between media I, II, and III are matched and \uf0b1 \uf072 is\ndropped for the sake of simplicity.\nInitially, consider the case in which \uf064 \uf03d \uf061 and \uf063 \uf03d \uf02d \uf062 . For this case, Eq. (39) can be\nexpressed as\n\uf028\uf061 \uf032 \uf02b \uf062 \uf032 \uf029 \uf03d \uf028\uf061 \uf032 \uf02b \uf062 \uf032 \uf029\uf032 .\n(40)\nTherefore, from the assumption of non-zero constants, we have \uf028\uf061 \uf032 \uf02b \uf062 \uf032 \uf029 \uf03d 1 . This condition\ncan be generally satisfied by setting \uf061 \uf03d cos \uf071 and \uf062 \uf03d sin \uf071 . Hence the mapping in Eq. (37)\ncan be expressed as\nx ' \uf03d cos \uf071 x \uf02b sin \uf071 y, y ' \uf03d \uf02d sin \uf071 x \uf02b cos \uf071 y, z ' \uf03d z ,\n(41)\nwhich corresponds to the two-dimensional rotation of the coordinates. Actually, the rotation of\nthe coordinates does not change the material parameter in Eq. (5) because m ' for this\ntransformation is a unit diagonal.\nHowever, Eq. (39) can be satisfied in various other ways than \uf064 \uf03d \uf061 and \uf063 \uf03d \uf02d \uf062 . For\nexample, by choosing the values of the constants in Eq. (39) as \uf061 \uf03d 3 , \uf062 \uf03d 4 , \uf063 \uf03d 1 , and\n\uf064 \uf03d 3 , this gives the mapping of\n(42)\nx ' \uf03d 3x \uf02b 4 y, y ' \uf03d x \uf02b 3 y, z ' \uf03d z ,\nand a metric tensor of\n\uf0e95 3 0 \uf0f9\n(43)\nm ' \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0ea3 2 0 \uf0fa\uf0fa ,\n\uf0ea\uf0eb0 0 0.2 \uf0fa\uf0fb\nwhich satisfies Eq. (39).\nThis coordinate transformation given in Eq. (42) maps the geometrical grids of the virtual\nspace in the Cartesian coordinates into a skewed and expanded one as presented in Fig. 3. In\nFig. 3, the dotted and circled lines correspond to lines that are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis\nbefore the transformation, respectively, and the thin grid lines denote the grid lines in the x ' y ' coordinates.\n\n\fy'\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nx'\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 3. Transformed geometrical grid made by the skewed and expanded transformation given\nby Eq. (42).\n\nIn Fig. 4, we present the electric field distributions obtained from a commercial software\nprogram based on the finite element method [18]. In this figure, the field radiating from a\npoint (line) source propagates through a finite coordinate transformed slab which satisfies the\ncondition Eq. (39) by the mapping function in Eq. (42) without reflections. In this calculation,\nthe thickness of the coordinate transformed slab is 4\uf06c , where \uf06c is the free-space wavelength.\n\nFig. 4. Field distributions for the skewed-and-expanded coordinate transformation.\n\n3.2. Further examples\nSome interesting discussions on the reflectionless condition of the finite-embedded CTM has\nbeen reported [17]. In that study, the following mapping function was considered:\nx ' \uf03d au ( x), y ' \uf03d y / u x ( x) \uf02b v( x), z ' \uf03d z,\n(44)\nwhich can be expressed using the conventions in Eqs. (26)-(28) as\nA( x) \uf03d au ( x), C ( x) \uf03d v( x), H ( x) \uf03d 1/ u x ( x), K ( y ) \uf03d y,\n(45)\nin which the other functions and constants are all zero. In this case, using the newly-derived\ncondition in Eq. (29), we can obtain the following condition for a non-reflecting boundary:\n(46)\n( au x ) 2 \uf03d (au x / u x ) 2 ,\nwhich corresponds to\n(47)\nu x \uf03d \uf0b11,\nand this coincides well with the results reported in Ref. [17].\nLet us consider another example similar to Eq. (44): the following form of\ntransformation\n\n\f(48)\nx ' \uf03d au x ( x), y ' \uf03d y / u ( x) \uf02b v( x), z ' \uf03d z,\nwhich can be expressed using the conventions in Eqs. (26)-(28) as\nA( x) \uf03d au x ( x), C ( x) \uf03d v( x), H ( x) \uf03d 1/ u ( x), K ( y ) \uf03d y,\n(49)\nwith other functions and constants as zero. Using the condition in Eq. (29), we have the\ncondition of the non-reflection boundary as\n( au xx ) 2 \uf03d (au xx / u ) 2 ,\n(50)\nwhich corresponds to\nu \uf03d \uf0b11\n(51)\nat the boundaries. From the mapping functions in Eqs. (44) and (48), it can be found that\nmapping functions which enable transparency can have various other forms than that\nintroduced in Ref. [12].\n4. Extended example: an extended two-dimensional case\n\n4.1. Reflectionless beam expander\nNow let us consider more complicated cases which satisfy Eq. (19). What we will examine is\nthe case in which the mapping functions are given as\nx ' \uf03d x , y ' \uf03d m ( x ) y , z ' \uf03d c ( x ) z.\n(52)\nThis satisfies Eq. (19) for Ayz ' \uf03d Ayx ' \uf03d 0 . The mapping functions in Eq. (52) correspond to the\ncase in which the scaling of the axes is applied simultaneously in two tangential directions.\nFor this case, the material tensor m ' is given as\nmx y\ncx z\n\uf0e9 1\n\uf0f9\n1 \uf0ea\n\uf0fa.\n2\n2\n(53)\nm' \uf03d\nm\ny\nm\ny\nm\nm\nyc\nz\n(\n)\n\uf02b\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\uf0fa\ncm \uf0ea\n2\n2\nmx ycx z\n(cx z ) \uf02b c \uf0fb\uf0fa\n\uf0eb\uf0ea cx z\nIf we assume that k z \uf03d 0 , Eq. (22) is applicable to this case, we arrive at the following\ncondition for the non-reflecting boundaries:\nc( x) \uf03d \uf0b1 \uf072i [ m( x)]2 .\n(54)\nThe electric field distributions and the corresponding values of the material parameters are\nshown in Fig. 5.\n\nMaterial parameter vlaue\n\n3\n\n(a )\n\na\nb\nd\nf\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n(b )\n-2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nx/\uf06c\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFig. 5. Numerical results for the example of the two-dimensional beam expander without any\nreflection. The normalized field distribution at z \uf03d 0 plane is depicted in (a). The results in (b)\nshow the material parameters ( m ) along the line\n\ny \uf03d 5\uf06c .\n\nThe results presented in Eq. (54) and in Fig. 5 are contradictory to conventional knowledge on\ncoordinate transformations based a beam expander. Until now, it was generally believed that a\n\n\fnon-reflecting beam expander cannot be produced except for the case where the indices of the\nsurrounding media are selected so as to match the square value of the magnification factor\nm( x) at the boundaries (i.e. see the related discussions in Ref. [8]). However, as evidenced by\nEq. (54), this is not true if we restrict the magnification to be applied in only one of the\ntransversal directions (along the direction of y-axis in this case) and ignore the conical\nincidences ( k z , I \uf03d 0 ).\nIn Fig. 5, we assumed that all the untransformed media are free-space ( \uf072 \uf03d 1 ) and the xdependent magnification factor is a linear function given in Eq. (34) with the thickness of the\nslab d of 2\u03bb and the magnification factor at the second interface M as 1.5. The calculated field\ndistribution shows that the slab for the beam expander expands the beam, with almost no\nreflections, at the interfaces. The small observable ripples in the field distribution at the leftside of the CMT slab are due to numerical errors and the non-optimized nature of the gradient\nalong the x-direction in the scale function m( x) . If the material parameters of the transformed\nregion in the x-direction are carefully designed to implement adiabatic variation over a\nsufficiently long width, the ripples can be decreased. However, the results clearly show that\nthe proposed method can be readily applied to the design of a reflectionless CTM.\n5. Conclusions\n\nA general method for creating a non-reflecting finite-embedded coordinate transformed slab,\nwhen the mapping function is defined in extended two-dimensional conventions under the\ncondition of k z \uf03d 0 and a governing equation that can be used as the determinant equation or\nas a guideline for the design is proposed. To verify our approach and demonstrate the validity\nof the strategy, we explored several examples and discussed the topological meanings of these.\nWe hope that our approach and the discussions contained in this report will be helpful in\ndesigning or understanding finite-embedded coordinate transformed media. We also hope that\nthe approach introduced in this study can serve as a guide or a starting point for investigations\nof more general cases such as conical incidences or full three-dimensional mapping functions.\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of the National Research Foundation and the\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technology of Korea through the Creative Research\nInitiative Program (Active Plasmonics Application Systems).\nAppendix\n\nIn this section, we show that Eq. (19) is a necessary condition for a slab of finite-embedded\ncoordinate transformation to be non-reflecting under the constraint of the extended twodimensional mapping functions given in Eq. (2).\nLet us start from the condition which makes the reflectance r zero in Eq. (18):\n(A1)\n\uf044\uf065 II \uf06b x , I \uf03d \uf065 I (\uf044 22\uf06b x , II \uf02d \uf04412\uf06b y ).\nTo make the interface non-reflecting, Eq. (A1) should be held for arbitrary value of \uf06b y . For\nthis objective, we square both sides of Eq. (A1) and eliminate all \uf06b x , I and \uf06b x , II dependencies\nby using the dispersion relations for media I and II. The dispersion relation for medium I is\nexpressed as\n\uf06b x2, I \uf03d nI2 \uf02d \uf06b y2 ,\n(A2)\nand that for medium II is expressed as in Eq. (11), which can be re-expressed as\n(A3)\n[( \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 )\uf06b x , II \uf02b (\uf044 23 \uf04413 \uf02d \uf04412 \uf04433 )\uf06b y ]2 \uf03d \uf044 2 [(\uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 )nII2 \uf02d \uf04433\uf06b y2 ].\nFor any real-valued coordinate transformation a \uf03d [( Axx ' ) 2 \uf02b ( Ayx ' ) 2 \uf02b ( Azx ' ) 2 ] / det( A) cannot be\nzero. Therefore, we have \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 \uf03d a\uf044 \uf0b9 0 . If we assume that the coordinate\n\n\f2\ntransformation can be complex-valued, and hence admit those cases of \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 23\n\uf03d 0 , Eq.\n(A3) can be expressed as\n[( \uf044 23 \uf04413 \uf02d \uf04412 \uf04433 ) 2 \uf02b \uf044 2 \uf044 33 ]\uf06b y2 \uf03d 0.\n(A4)\n\nLet us examine Eq. (A4) further. When ( \uf044 23 \uf04413 \uf02d \uf04412 \uf044 33 ) 2 \uf02b \uf044 2 \uf04433 \uf03d 0 , \uf06b y cannot be\ndetermined and otherwise, \uf06b y \uf03d 0 . All these cases are contrary to the claim that Eq. (A1)\nholds regardless of \uf06b y . Therefore, we discard the case where \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 is zero. Therefore,\nwe can express \uf06b x , II as a function of \uf06b y :\n\n\uf06b x , II \uf03d\n\n1\n\n\uf07b\uf02d ( \uf044\n\n1/ 2\n\n2\n\uf04413 \uf02d \uf04412 \uf044 33 )\uf06b y \uf0b1 \uf044 \uf0e9\uf0eb(\uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 23\n)nII2 \uf02d \uf044 33\uf06b y2 \uf0f9\uf0fb\n\n\uf07d\n\n(A5)\n.\n\uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044\nWhen we substitute Eqs. (A2) and (A5) into Eq. (A1) and, after performing some arithmetic\nmanipulations, we have\n( \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 ) 2 \uf044 2\uf065 II2 ( nI2 \uf02d \uf06b y2 )\n(A6)\n2\n\uf03d \uf065 I2 \uf07b\uf044 23 ( \uf04412 \uf044 23 \uf02d \uf044 22 \uf04413 )\uf06b y \uf0b1 \uf044\uf044 22 [( \uf044 22 \uf04433 \uf02d \uf044 223 )nII2 \uf02d \uf044 33\uf06b y2 ]1/ 2 \uf07d .\n2\n23\n\n23\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we cast a simplified from of Eq. (A6) by adopting proper\nsubstitutions in the coefficients:\n2\n\nA \uf02d B\uf06b y2 \uf03d \uf0e9\uf0ebC\uf06b y \uf0b1 ( D \uf02b E\uf06b y2 )1/ 2 \uf0f9\uf0fb ,\n\n(A7)\n\nwhich can be expressed as\nA \uf02d D \uf02d ( B \uf02b C 2 \uf02d E )\uf06b y2 \uf03d \uf0b12C\uf06b y ( D \uf02b E\uf06b y2 )1/ 2 .\nWe square both sides of Eq. (A8) to obtain\n( A \uf02d D ) 2 \uf02d 2[( A \uf02d D )( B \uf02b C 2 \uf02b E ) \uf02b 2C 2 D ]\uf06b y2 \uf02b [( B \uf02b C 2 \uf02b E ) 2 \uf02d 4C 2 E ]\uf06b y4 \uf03d 0.\n\n(A8)\n(A9)\n\nThis should be held for arbitrary values of \uf06b y . Therefore, we have the following set of\nequations that should be satisfied simultaneously:\n(A10)\nA \uf02d D \uf03d 0,\n(A11)\nCD \uf03d 0,\n( B \uf02b C 2 \uf02b E ) 2 \uf02d 4C 2 E \uf03d 0.\n(A12)\nBefore solving the above coupled equations, let us first examine Eq. (A11). From this\nequation, we can find that either C or D should be zero. By comparing Eqs. (A6) and (A7), we\ncan find that Eq. (A11) can be re-expressed in a more explicit form as\n\uf044 23 (\uf04412 \uf044 23 \uf02d \uf044 22 \uf04413 ) \uf03d 0 or \uf044 222 (\uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 ) \uf03d 0,\n(A13)\nwhere the two equations correspond to the conditions that C \uf03d 0 or D \uf03d 0 , in the order of\nappearance.\nLet us consider the latter case first. As we examined before, \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 is not zero.\nThen if \uf044 22 \uf03d 0 , all \uf06b x , II dependent terms in the dispersion relation of Eq. (A3) vanish, i.e.,\nthe value of \uf06b x , II is undetermined. Therefore we can also discard this case. Therefore, to\nsatisfy Eq. (A11), we find that C \uf03d 0 . With this result, we further find from Eqs. (A10) and\n(A12) that A \uf03d D and B \uf03d \uf02d E .\nBy comparing Eqs. (A6) and (A7) once again and using the results of A \uf03d D and\nB \uf03d \uf02d E , we have following conditions:\n2\n2\n(\uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 23\n)\uf065 II2 nI2 \uf03d \uf044 22\n\uf065 I2 nII2 ,\n(A14)\n( \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 ) 2 \uf065 II2 \uf03d \uf044 222 \uf044 33\uf065 I2 .\nEquations (A14) and (A15) can be further simplified by combining them as\n\uf044 33 nI2 \uf03d ( \uf044 22 \uf044 33 \uf02d \uf044 223 )nII2 .\n\n(A15)\n(A16)\n\n\fAs a final step, we substitute Eq. (A16) into Eq. (A14) to obtain the form of\n\uf044 33 \uf06d I2 \uf03d \uf044 222 \uf06d II2 .\n(A17)\nNow, let us consider the condition of C \uf03d 0 in more detail. As we examined in Eq. (A13),\nthis corresponds to the case \uf044 23 (\uf04412 \uf044 23 \uf02d \uf044 22 \uf04413 ) \uf03d 0 . This condition can be expressed using\nthe Jacobian elements of the coordinate transformation:\n(A18)\n( Axx ' Ayz ' \uf02d Ayx ' Axz ' )( Axx ' Axz ' \uf02b Ayx ' Ayz ' ) \uf03d 0.\nWith Eq. (A18), we derive Eq. (19). Equation (A18) is a necessary condition for the boundary\nof an extended two-dimensional finite embedded coordinate medium to be non-reflecting. As\na result, Eqs. (A17) and (A18) are necessary and sufficient conditions for an extended twodimensional finite embedded coordinate medium to be non-reflecting.\n\n\f"}
