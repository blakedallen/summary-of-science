We recall an algorithm for reducing the matrices of a unitary representation\nto canonical form, give a certain description of the representations\nof canonical form, and reduce the problem of classifying Euclidean\nrepresentations to the problem of classifying unitary representations.\nWe also describe the set of dimensions of all indecomposable unitary\n(Euclidean) representations of a quiver and establish the number of\nparameters in an indecomposable unitary representation of a given\ndimension.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany problems of linear algebra can be formulated and studied in terms of\nquivers and their representations, which were proposed by Gabriel [1] (see\nalso [2]). A quiver is a directed graph. Its representation A is given by\nassigning to each vertex i a vector space Ai and to each arrow \u03b1 : i \u2192 j a\nlinear mapping A\u03b1 : Ai \u2192 Aj . For example, the canonical form problems\n\u2704\nq \u2663 correspond to the canonical\nfor representations of the quivers \u272f\n\u2702 \u2663 and \u2663 \u2736\nThis is the author's version of a work that was published in Linear Algebra Appl. 278\n(1998) 37\u201362. Partially supported by Grant No. U6E000 from the International Science\nFoundation.\n\n1\n\n\fform problems for linear operators (whose solution is the Jordan normal\nform) and for pairs of linear mappings from one space to another (the matrix\npencil problem, solved by Kronecker).\nIn this chapter we study unitary and Euclidean representations of a quiver\nup to isometry. A unitary (Euclidean) representation A is given by assigning\nto each vertex i a finite dimensional unitary (Euclidean) space Ai and to\neach arrow \u03b1 : i \u2192 j a linear mapping A\u03b1 : Ai \u2192 Aj . We say that two\nunitary (Euclidean) representations A and B are isometric and write A \u2243 B\nif there exists a system of isometries \u03a6i : Ai \u2192 Bi such that \u03a6j A\u03b1 = B\u03b1 \u03a6i\nfor each \u03b1 : i \u2192 j.\nOur main tool is Littlewood's algorithm [3] for reducing matrices to triangular canonical form via unitary similarity. In [4] I rediscovered Littlewood's algorithm and applied it to the canonical form problem for unitary\nrepresentations of a quiver. Various algorithms for reducing matrices to different canonical forms under unitary similarity were also proposed by Brenner, Mitchell, McRae, Radjavi, Benedetti and Gragnolini, and others; see\nShapiro's survey [5].\nIn Section 2 we recall briefly Littlewood's algorithm and study the structure of canonical matrices much as it was made in [4] for the matrices of\nlinear operators in a unitary space.\nWe say that a matrix problem is unitarily wild if it contains the problem\nof classifying linear operators in a unitary space. In Section 2.3 we show that\nthe last problem contains the problem of classifying unitary representations\nof an arbitrary quiver (i.e., it is hopeless in a certain sense) and give examples\nof unitarily wild matrix problems.\nThe vector\ndim A = (dimA1 , dimA2 , . . . , dimAp ) \u2208 Np0\nis called the dimension of a representation A of a quiver Q with vertices\n1, 2, . . . , p (we denote\nN = {1, 2, . . . },\n\nN0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . }).\n\nIn Section 3 we describe the set of dimensions of direct-sum-indecomposable\nunitary representations of a quiver, and establish the number of parameters\nin an indecomposable unitary representation of a given dimension. Analogous, but much more fundamental and complicated, results for non-unitary\n2\n\n\frepresentations of a quiver were obtained by V. G. Kac [6, 7, 8] (see also [2,\nSect 7.4]).\nIn particular, if z \u2208 Np and Q is a connected quiver other than \u2022 and \u2022 \u2192 \u2022,\nthen there exists an indecomposable unitary representation of dimension z if\nand only if zMQ \u2265 z, where MQ = [mij ] is the p \u00d7 p matrix whose entry mij\nis the number of arrows of the form i \u2192 j and i \u2190 j, where\n(t1 , . . . , tp ) \u2265 (z1 , . . . , zp )\nmeans\nt1 \u2265 z1 , . . . , tp \u2265 zp .\n\nIn Section 4 we study Euclidean representations of a quiver. Let AC\ndenote the unitary representation obtained from a Euclidean representation\nA by complexification (A and AC are given by the same set of real matrices).\nIn Section 4.1 we prove intuitively obvious facts that\n(i) AC \u2243 BC implies A \u2243 B, and\n(ii) if A is indecomposable and AC is decomposable, then AC \u2243 U \u2295 \u016a ,\nwhere U is an indecomposable unitary representation.\nThis will imply that unitary and Euclidean representations have the same\nsets of dimensions of indecomposable representations.\nIn Section 4.2 we study, when a given unitary representation of a quiver\ncan be obtained by complexification. In particular, let A be a complex matrix\nthat is not unitarily similar to a direct sum of matrices, and let S \u22121 AS = \u0100\nfor a unitary matrix S (such S exists if A is unitarily similar to a real matrix).\nThen A is unitarily similar to a real matrix if and only if S is symmetric.\n\n2\n\nUnitary matrix problems\n\nWe suppose that the complex numbers are lexicographically ordered:\na + bi \u0016 a\u2032 + b\u2032 i if either a = a\u2032 and b \u2264 b\u2032 , or a < a\u2032 ;\n\n(1)\n\nand that the set of blocks of a block matrix A = [Aij ] are linearly ordered:\nAij \u2264 Ai\u2032 j \u2032 if either i = i\u2032 and j \u2264 j \u2032 , or i > i\u2032 .\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fA block complex matrix with a given (perhaps empty) set of marked\nsquare blocks will be called a marked block matrix ; a square block is marked\nby a line along its principal diagonal. By a unitary matrix problem we mean\nthe classification problem for marked block matrices\nA = [Aij ],\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 l,\n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 r,\n\nup to transformations\nA 7\u2192 B := R\u22121 AS = [Ri\u22121 Aij Sj ],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nR = R1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Rl ,\n\nS = S1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Sr\n\nare unitary matrices, and Ri = Sj whenever the block Aij is marked. The\ntransformation (3) is called an admissible transformation; we say that these\nmarked block matrices A and B (with the same disposition of marked blocks)\nare equivalent and write A \u223c B or\n(R, S) : A \u2740 B.\n\n(4)\n\nNotice that a matrix consisting of a single block is reduced by transformations of unitary similarity if the block is marked, and by transformations of\nunitary equivalence otherwise. Moreover, the matrices of every unitary representation A of a quiver can be placed into a marked block matrix A such\nthat the admissible transformations with A correspond to reselections of the\northogonal bases in the spaces of A, for example,\n2\n\u03bc\n\u271e\n\u2720\n\u03bb \u271d \u273f1 \u271b\n\n2.1\n\n\u03be\n\u03bd\n\n\u2758\n\n3\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS3\n\nS1\u22121\n\nA\u03bb\n\nA\u03bc\n\nA\u03bd\n\nS3\u22121\n\n0\n\n(5)\nA\u03be\n\nAn algorithm\n\nThe algorithm is based on the following two lemmas:\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\fLemma 2.1. (a) Each complex matrix A is unitarily equivalent to the matrix\nD = a1 I \u2295 * * * \u2295 ak\u22121 I \u2295 0,\n\nai \u2208 R,\n\na1 > * * * > ak\u22121 > 0.\n\n(6)\n\n(b) If R\u22121 DS = D \u2032 , where R and S are unitary matrices and D, D \u2032 are\nof the form (6), then D = D \u2032 ,\nS = S1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Sk\u22121 \u2295 S \u2032 ,\nand\nR = S1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Sk\u22121 \u2295 R\u2032 ,\n\nwhere each Si has the same size as ai I.\n\nLemma 2.2. (a) Each square complex matrix A is unitarily similar to the\nblock-triangular matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03bb1 \u0017 * * * \u0017 \u03bbk\n\u03bb1 I F12 * * * F1k\n(see (1)), the columns\n\uf8ef\n\u03bb2 I * * * F2k \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nF =\uf8ef\n(7)\n.. \uf8fa , of Fi,i+1 are linearly\n..\n\uf8f0\n.\n. \uf8fb\nindependent if \u03bbi =\n0\n\u03bbk I\n\u03bb .\ni+1\n\n(b) If S \u22121 F S = F \u2032 , where S is a unitary matrix and F and F \u2032 have the\nform (7), then \u03bbi I = \u03bb\u2032i I and\nS = S1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Sk ,\nwhere each Si has the same size as \u03bbi I.\nProof. These lemmas were proved in many articles, see, for example, [3, 4, 5],\nso we give only an outline of their proofs. Part (a) of Lemma 2.1 is the\nsingular value decomposition; part (b) follows from\nD = D\u2032,\n\nS \u2217 D \u2217 R\u2217\u22121 = D \u2217 ,\nD 2 R = RD 2 ,\n\nS \u22121 DR = D,\n\nD 2 S = SD 2 .\n\nThe matrix (7) is the matrix of an arbitrary linear operator A : Cn \u2192 Cn in\nan orthogonal basis f1 , . . . , fn such that f1 , . . . , ftr is a basis of\nKer(A \u2212 \u03bb1 I) * * * (A \u2212 \u03bbr I),\n\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 k,\n\nwhere\n(x \u2212 \u03bb1 ) * * * (x \u2212 \u03bbk ),\n\n\u03bb1 \u0017 * * * \u0017 \u03bbk ,\n\nis the minimal polynomial of A; it proves part (a) of Lemma 2.2. Successively\nequating the blocks of F S = SF \u2032 ordered with (2), we prove part (b).\n5\n\n\fBy the canonical part of the matrix (6) or (7), we mean the matrix (6)\nor, respectively, the collection of blocks Fij , i \u2265 j. According to Lemmas 2.1\nand 2.2, the canonical part is uniquely determined by the initial matrix A\nand does not change if A is replaced by a unitarily equivalent or, respectively,\nsimilar matrix.\nThe algorithm for reducing a marked block matrix A = [Aij ] to canonical\nform:\nLet Apq be the first (in the ordering (2)) block of A that changes under admissible transformations (3). Depending on the arrangement of the\nmarked blocks, it is reduced by the transformations of unitary equivalence\nor similarity. Respectively, we reduce A = [Aij ] to the matrix \u00c3 = [\u00c3ij ] with\n\u00c3pq of the form (6) or (7), and then restrict ourselves to those admissible\ntransformations with \u00c3 that preserve the canonical part of \u00c3pq . As follows\nfrom Lemmas 2.1(b) and 2.2(b), they are exactly the admissible transformations with the marked block matrix A\u2032 that is obtained in the following\nway: The block \u00c3pq of the form (6) or (7) consists of k horizontal and k\nvertical strips; we extend this partition to the whole p-th horizontal and the\nwhole q-th vertical strips of \u00c3. If new k divisions pass through the marked\nblock \u00c3ij , we carry out k perpendicular divisions such that \u00c3ij is partitioned\ninto k \u00d7 k subblocks with square diagonal blocks (they are crossed by the\nmarking line) and repeat this for all new divisions. We additionally mark the\nsubblocks a1 I, . . . , ak\u22121 I of \u00c3pq if it has the form (6). The obtained marked\nblock matrix A\u2032 will be called the derived matrix of A. Clearly, A \u223c B implies\nA\u2032 \u223c B \u2032 .\nLet us consider the sequence of derived matrices\nA(0) := A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 , . . . , A(s) .\n\n(8)\n\nThis sequence ends with a certain matrix A(s) , s \u2265 0, for which the admissible\ntransformations do not change any of its blocks, i.e, A(s) is equivalent only\nto itself. Then A \u223c B implies A(s) \u223c B (s) , i.e., A(s) = B (s) . Remove from\nA(s) all additional divisions into subblocks and additional marking lines that\nhave appeared during the reduction of A to A(s) . The obtained marked block\nmatrix will be called a canonical matrix or the canonical form of A and will\nbe denoted by A\u221e . We have the following\nTheorem 2.1. Each marked block matrix A is equivalent to the uniquely\ndetermined canonical matrix A\u221e ; moreover, A \u223c B if and only if A\u221e = B \u221e .\n\u2737\n6\n\n\fWe will take under consideration the null matrices 00n , 0m0 , and 000 of\nsize 0 \u00d7 n, m \u00d7 0, and 0 \u00d7 0, putting for a p \u00d7 q matrix M\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0002\n\u0003\nM\n,\nM \u2295 00n = M 0pn , M \u2295 0m0 =\n0mq\n0m0 \u2295 00n = 0mn . Respectively, we will consider block matrices with \"empty\"\nhorizontal and/or vertical strips.\nLet A = [Aij ] and B = [Bij ] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r) be marked block\nmatrices with the same set of indices (i, j) of the marked blocks. By the block\ndirect sum of A and B we mean the marked block matrix\nA \u228e B := [Aij \u2295 Bij ]\nwith the same disposition of marked blocks. If\nT1 = (R1 , S1 ) : A \u2740 C\nand\nT2 = (R2 , S2 ) : B \u2740 D\n(see (4)), then R1 , R2 and, respectively, S1 , S2 are block diagonal matrices\nwith l and, respectively, r diagonal square blocks, and\nT1 \u228e T2 := (R1 \u228e R2 , S1 \u228e S2 ) : A \u228e B \u2740 C \u228e D.\nA marked block matrix A is said to be indecomposable if\n(i) its size other than 0 \u00d7 0, and\n(ii) A \u223c B \u228e C implies that B or C has size 0 \u00d7 0.\nFor every matrices M1 , . . . , Mn , N, we define\n(M1 , . . . , Mn ) \u2297 N := (M1 \u2297 N, . . . , Mn \u2297 N),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Mi \u2297 N is obtained from Mi by replacing its entries a with aN.\nTheorem 2.2. (a) Each marked block matrix A is equivalent to a matrix of\nthe form\nB = (P1 \u2297 Im1 ) \u228e * * * \u228e (Pt \u2297 Imt )\n\u223c P1 \u228e * * * \u228e P1 \u228e * * * \u228e Pt \u228e * * * \u228e Pt ,\n|\n|\n{z\n}\n{z\n}\nm1 copies\nmt copies\n7\n\n\fwhere P1 , . . . , Pt are nonequivalent indecomposable marked block matrices,\nuniquely determined up to equivalence (we may take P1 = P1\u221e , . . . , Pt = Pt\u221e ),\nand m1 , . . . , mt are uniquely determined natural numbers. Every admissible\ntransformation T : B \u2740 B that preserves B has the form\nT = (1P1 \u2297 U1 ) \u228e * * * \u228e (1Pt \u2297 Ut ),\nwhere 1Pi = (I, I) : Pi \u2740 Pi is the identity transformation of Pi , and Ui is a\nunitary mi \u00d7 mi matrix (1 \u2264 i \u2264 t).\n(b) A marked block matrix A of size 6= 0 \u00d7 0 is indecomposable if and\nonly if every preserving it admissible transformation T : A \u2740 A has the form\nT = a1A , a \u2208 C, |a| = 1.\n(c) A canonical matrix can be reduced to an equivalent block direct sum\nof indecomposable canonical matrices using only admissible permutations of\nrows and columns.\nProof. (a) We may take A = A\u221e . Since admissible transformations with\nA(i) , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s, (see (8)) are exactly the admissible transformations with A\nthat preserve the already reduced part of A(i) (preserve A(s) if i = s), the set\nof admissible transformations with A(s) consists of all (R, S) : A \u2740 A. By\n(3),\nR = R1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Rl ,\nS = S1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Sr ,\nwhere l \u00d7 r is the number of blocks of A. Since (R, S) : A(s) \u2740 A(s) , we have\nRi = Uf (i,1) \u2295 * * * \u2295 Uf (i,li ) ,\n\nSj = Ug(j,1) \u2295 * * * \u2295 Ug(j,rj ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nf (i, \u03b1), g(j, \u03b2) \u2208 {1, . . . , t}\n\nand U1 , . . . , Ut are arbitrary unitary matrices of fixed sizes. A(s) differs from\nA only by additional divisions of its strips into substrips (and by additional\nmarking lines). We transpose substrips within each strip of A to obtain a\nmatrix B \u223c A such that, for all (R, S) : B \u2740 B, we have (10) with\nf (i, 1) \u2264 * * * \u2264 f (i, li ),\n\ng(j, 1) \u2264 * * * \u2264 g(j, rj ).\n\nClearly, B satisfies (a).\n(b)&(c) These statemants are obvious.\n\n8\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe structure of canonical matrices\n\nIn this section we divide the set of canonical m \u00d7 n matrices into disjoint\nsubsets of canonical matrices with the same \"scheme\" (the number of such\nschemes is finite for each size m \u00d7 n), and show how to construct all the\ncanonical matrices with a given scheme (for matrices under unitary similarity\nthis was made briefly in [4]).\nWe partition a canonical matrix into zones, which illustrate the reduction\nprocess.\nLet A = A\u221e be a canonical matrix. Then all its derived matrices (8) differ\nfrom A only by additional divisions and marking lines. Denote by Pl (0 \u2264\nl < s) the first block of A(l) that changes under admissible transformations\n(it is reduced when we construct A(l+1) ).\n(l)\n(l)\nLet Aij be a block of A(l) such that either Aij \u2264 Pl or l = s. The admissible transformations with A(l) induce the unitary equivalence or similarity\n(l)\n(l)\ntransformations with Aij . Respectively, Aij has the form (6) or (7); we de(l)\nnote by Z(Aij ) its canonical part (see page 6). Defining by induction in l,\n(l)\n(l)\nwe call Z(Aij ) by a zone and l by its depth if either l = 0 or Z(Aij ) is not\ncontained in a zone of depth < l.\n(l)\n(l)\nFor each zone Z = Z(Aij ), we put Bl(Z) := Aij and call Z by an\nequivalence (similarity) zone if Bl(Z) is transformed by unitary equivalence\n(similarity) transformations.\nClearly, every canonical matrix A is partitioned into equivalence and similarity zones; for example (for a marked block matrix of the form \u2745\u2745\n),\n\n9\n\n\fA=\n\ni 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3\n\u2745\n0 \u2745i 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0\u2745i 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0\u2745i\u27450 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\u2745 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 0\u2745\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\u2745\n0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u2745\n0 0\n\u2745\n\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\ni\n0\n0\n0\n5\n0\n\ni\n0\n4\n4\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\n7 8\n8\n5\n6\n4 4\n\n3\n=\n1\n\n(11)\n\n2\n\nis partitioned into 10 zones, their depths are indicated on the right of (11).\nLet A be a canonical matrix partitioned into zones. For each similarity\nzone, we replace all its diagonal elements by stars. For each equivalence zone,\nwe replace all its nonzero elements by circles, and join with a line its circles\ncorresponding to equal elements (this line does not coincide with a marking\nline because the marking lines connect stars). The other elements of A are\nzeros, we replace theirs by points. The obtained picture will be called the\nscheme S(A) of A.\nFor example, the canonical matrix (11) has the scheme\n\nS(A) =\n\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\u2022\n*\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\u2022\n*\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\u2022\n*\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\u22c6\n\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n\u2022\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n\u2022\n*\n*\n\n\u2022\n*\n\u22c6\n*\n*\n*\n\u2022\n*\n\n\u22c6\n*\n\u2022\n\u2022\n*\n*\n*\n\u2022\n\nTheorem 2.3. Each canonical matrix A = [aij ] with a given scheme S = [sij ]\ncan be constructed by successive filling of its zones by numbers starting with\n10\n\n\fthe zones of greatest depth as follows: Let Z be a zone of depth d(Z) and\nlet all entries in zones of depth > d(Z) be replaced by numbers. Then we\nreplace all points, circles, and stars of Z, respectively, by zeros, positive real\nnumbers, and complex numbers such that the following conditions hold:\n1) Let sij and si+1,j+1 be circles in Z. Then aij = ai+1,j+1 if sij and\nsi+1,j+1 are linked by a line, and aij > ai+1,j+1 otherwise.\n2) Let s\u03b1,\u03b2 , . . . , s\u03b1+k,\u03b2+k be all stars of Z that lie under a certain stair of\nZ. Then\na\u03b1,\u03b2 = * * * = a\u03b1+k,\u03b2+k .\nIf\n\ns\u03b1+k+1,\u03b2+k+1, . . . , s\u03b1+t,\u03b2+t\nare all stars of Z that lie under the next stair of Z, then a\u03b1,\u03b2 \u0017 a\u03b1+t,\u03b2+t ;\nmoreover, a\u03b1,\u03b2 \u227b a\u03b1+t,\u03b2+t whenever the columns of the block\n[ aij | \u03b1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b1 + k, \u03b2 + k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03b2 + t]\nare linearly dependent (this block has been filled by numbers because all its\nentries are located in zones of depth > d(Z)).\n\u2737\nThis theorem gives a convenient way to present solutions of unitary matrix\nproblems in small sizes by their sets of schemes. Thus, the list of schemes of\ncanonical 5 \u00d7 5 matrices under unitary similarity was obtained by Klimenko\n[11].\n\n2.3\n\nUnitarily wild matrix problems\n\nThe canonical form problem for pairs of n \u00d7 n matrices under simultaneous\n\u2704\nsimilarity (i.e., for representations of the quiver \u272f\n\u2702 \u2663 \u2768\u2701 ) plays a special role\nin the theory of (non-unitary) matrix problems. It may be proved that its\nsolution implies the clasification of representations of every quiver (and even\nrepresentations of every finite dimensional algebra). For this reason, the\nclassification problem for pairs of matrices under simultaneous similarity is\nused as a yardstick of the complexity; Donovan and Freislich [12] (see also [2])\nsuggested to name a classification problem wild if it contains the problem of\nsimultaneous similarity, and otherwise to name it tame (in accordance with\nthe partition of animals into wild and tame ones).\nThe canonical form problem for an n \u00d7 n matrix under unitary similarity\n\u2704\n(i.e., for unitary representations of the quiver \u272f\n\u2702 \u2663 ) plays the same role in the\n11\n\n\ftheory of unitary matrix problems: it contains the problem of classifying unitary representations of every quiver. For example, the problem of classifying\nunitary representations of the quiver (5) can be regarded (by Lemma 2.2) as\nthe problem of classifying, up to unitary similarity, matrices of the form:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n5I I A\u03bb A\u03bd A\u03bc\n\uf8ef 0 4I I\n0\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8fa.\n0\n3I\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 0\n0\n0 2I A\u03be \uf8fb\n0\n0\n0\n0\nI\nA matrix problem is called unitarily wild (or *-wild, see [13]) if it contains\nthe problem of classifying matrices via unitary similarity, and unitarily tame\notherwise.\nFor each unitary problem, one has an alternative: to solve it or to prove\nthat it is unitarily wild (and hence is hopeless in a certain sense). In this\nsection we give some examples of such alternatives.\n(i) Let us consider the problems of classifying nilpotent linear operators\n\u03c6, \u03c6n = 0, in a unitary space.\nFor n = 2 this problem is unitarily tame; the canonical matrix of \u03c6 (see\npage 6) is\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0 D\n,\n0 0\nwhere D is of the form (6) without zero columns. Indeed, a matrix F = [Fij ]\nof the form (7) satisfies F 2 = 0 only if k = 2, F11 = 0, and F22 = 0; we can\nreduce F12 to the form (6).\nFor n > 2 this problem is unitarily wild since the matrices\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0 I X\n0 I Y\n\uf8f0 0 0 I \uf8fb and \uf8f0 0 0 I \uf8fb\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nare unitarily similar if and only if X and Y are unitarily similar (see also\n[14]).\n(ii) Let us consider the problem of classifying m-tuples (p1 , . . . , pm ) of\nprojectors p2i = pi in a unitary space.\n\n12\n\n\fFor m = 1 this problem is unitarily time; the canonical matrix of a\nprojector p = p2 was obtained in [15] and [16]. Of course, it is\n\u0015\n\u0014\nI D\n,\n0 0\nwhere D is of the form (6), since a matrix F = [Fij ] of the form (7) satisfies\nF 2 = F only if k = 2, F11 = I, and F22 = 0.\nAs was proved in [16], for m \u2265 2 this problem is unitarily wild even if\np1 is an orthoprojector, i.e. p1 = p21 = p\u22171 , (since the pairs of idempotent\nmatrices\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013\nI 0\nX I \u2212X\n,\n0 0\nX I \u2212X\nand\n\n\u0012\u0014\n\nI 0\n0 0\n\n\u0015 \u0014\nY\n,\nY\n\nI \u2212Y\nI \u2212Y\n\n\u0015\u0013\n\nare unitarily similar if and only if X and Y are unitarily similar), or if\np1 p2 = p2 p1 = 0.\n(iii) The problems of classifying the following operators and systems of\noperators in unitary spaces are unitarily wild:\n\u2022 Pairs of linear operators (\u03c6, \u03c8) such that\n\u03c62 = \u03c8 2 = \u03c6\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03c6 = 0\nsince\n\u0012\u0014\n\n0 I\n0 0\n\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013\n0 X\n,\n0 0\n\nand\n\n\u0012\u0014\n\n0 I\n0 0\n\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013\n0 Y\n,\n0 0\n\nare unitarily similar if and only if X and Y are unitarily similar.\n\u2022 Pairs of selfadjoint operators (\u03c6, \u03c8) because \u03c6 + i\u03c8 is an arbitrary\noperator.

Analogously (5), the matrices of every unitary representation A of Q\ncan be accommodated in a block diagonal matrix\nA = diag(A\u03b1q , A\u03b1q\u22121 , . . . , A\u03b11 , 0, . . . , 0)\nwith a certain set of marked blocks such that the admissible transformations with A correspond to the admissible transformations with M(A). Then\nM(A\u221e ) = M(A)\u221e and we can apply Theorem 2.2.\n\n3.2\n\nThe set of dimensions of indecomposable unitary\nrepresentations\n\nWe will use the following notation:\n\u2022 MQ = [mij ] is the p \u00d7 p matrix, in which mij is the number of arrows\ni \u2192 j and i \u2190 j of the quiver Q;\n\u2022 supp(z) is the full subquiver of Q with the vertex set {i | zi 6= 0} for\neach z \u2208 Np0 ;\n\u2022 ei = (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) \u2208 Np0 with 1 in the ith position.\n17\n\n\fDenote by D(Q) the subset of Np0 consists of e1 , . . . , ep , all ei + ej with\nmij = 1, and all nonzero z with connected supp(z) \u2208\n/ {\u2022, \u2022 \u2192 \u2022} such that\nzMQ \u2265 z.\nIn this section we prove:\nTheorem 3.2. D(Q) is the set of dimensions of indecomposable unitary\nrepresentations of a quiver Q.\nPut\n\u2206i (z) :=\n\nX\n\nz \u2208 Np0 ,\n\nmij zj ,\n\nj\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 p.\n\nThen\nzMQ = (\u22061 (z), . . . , \u2206p (z)).\n\nLemma 3.1. D(Q) satisfies the following conditions:\n(i) If z \u2208 D(Q) and supp(z) \u2208\n/ {\u2022, \u2022 \u2192 \u2022, \u2022 \u2768\u2701}, then zMQ > z.\n(ii) If z, u \u2208 D(Q) and z < u, then there exists i such that z + ei \u2264 u and\nz + ei \u2208 D(Q).\nProof. (i) Let\nz \u2208 D(Q),\n\nsupp(z) \u2208\n/ {\u2022, \u2022 \u2192 \u2022, \u2022 \u2768\u2701},\n\nzMQ = z.\n\nFix i such that zi = max{z1 , . . . , zp }. Then mij 6= 0 for a certain j 6= i. Since\nzj = \u2206j (z) \u2265 mij zi \u2265 zi ,\nwe have\nzi = zj ,\n\nmij = 1,\n\nmkj zk = 0\n\nfor all k 6= i. Taking zj and zi instead of zi and zj , we obtain mki zk = 0 for\nall k 6= j. Hence supp(z) = \u2022 \u2192 \u2022, a contradiction.\n(ii) Let z, u \u2208 D(Q) and z < u. If supp(z) 6= supp(u), then there exists\na nonzero mij with\ni \u2208 supp(u) \\ supp(z),\n\nj \u2208 supp(u) \u2229 supp(z).\n\nThe z + ei satisfies the requirements.\n18\n\n\fWe may assume that\nsupp(z) = supp(u) = Q.\nThen Q 6\u2208 {\u2022, \u2022 \u2192 \u2022}. Fix a vertex l such that zl < ul . We will suppose that\n\u2206l (z) = zl and mll = 0 (otherwise z + el satisfies the requirements).\nAssume first that zl \u2264 zj for some mlj 6= 0. The condition \u2206l (z) = zl\nimplies zl = zj , mlj = 1, and mlk = 0 for all k 6= j. Hence\nzj = zl < ul \u2264 \u2206l (u) = uj .\nSince Q 6= \u2022 \u2192 \u2022, mjk 6= 0 for some k 6= l, and we can take z + ej .\nNext, let zl > zj (and hence z + ej \u2208 D(Q)) for all nonzero mlj . If zj = uj\nfor all mlj 6= 0, then\nul \u2264 \u2206l (u) = \u2206l (z) = zl ,\na contradiction. Hence zj < uj for a certain mlj 6= 0, and we can take\nz + ej .\nLemma 3.2. If A is a unitary d representation of Q and d \u2208\n/ D(Q), then A\nis decomposable.\nProof. Assume to the contrary, that A is indecomposable. Then supp(d) is\nconnected; Lemma 2.1 and d \u2208\n/ D(Q) imply\nsupp (d) \u2208\n/ {\u2022, \u2022 \u2192 \u2022},\n\ndMQ \u0003 d,\n\nthat is, there exists l such that \u2206l (d) < dl . Then mll = 0 and we can assume\nthat there are no arrows starting from l (otherwise we replace each arrow\n\u03b1 : l \u2192 i by \u03b1\u2217 : i \u2192 l, simultaneously replacing A\u03b1 by the adjoint matrix).\nLet \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . , \u03b3 be all arrows stopping at l; combine the corresponding\nthem matrices of A into a single dl \u00d7 \u2206l (d) matrix\n[A\u03b1 |A\u03b2 | * * * |A\u03b3 ].\nThe number of its rows is greater than the number of its columns; making a\nzero row by unitary transformations of rows, we obtain A \u2243 B \u2295 P , where\nP is the zero representation of dimension el , a contradiction.\n\n19\n\n\fLemma 3.3. If there exists an indecomposable unitary z representation and\nzi < \u2206i (z) for a certain vertex i, then there exists an indecomposable unitary\nz + ei representation.\nProof. Let A be an indecomposable unitary z representation and z1 < \u22061 (z).\nWe can assume that each starting from the vertex 1 arrow is a loop (replacing\neach \u03bb : 1 \u2192 j, j 6= 1, by \u03bb\u2217 : j \u2192 1 and, respectively, A\u03bb by A\u2217\u03bb\u2217 ).\n1) Assume first that there is a loop \u03b1 : 1 \u2192 1 and define a unitary z + e1\nrepresentation H in which\n\u2022 H\u03b1 is the nilpotent Jordan block of size (z1 + 1) \u00d7 (z1 + 1),\n\u2022 H\u03b2 := A\u03b2 \u2295 011 for each \u03b2 : 1 \u2192 1, \u03b2 6= \u03b1;\n\u2022 H\u03b3 := A\u03b3 \u2295 010 for each \u03b3 : j \u2192 1, j 6= 1; and\n\u2022 H\u03b4 := A\u03b4 for each \u03b4 : j \u2192 k, k 6= 1.\nThe representation H is indecomposable.\nIndeed, let A\u2212 and H \u2212 denote the restrictions of A and H on the subquiver Q\u2212 := Q \\ \u03b1. By Theorem 3.1(a), we may assume that\nA\u2212 = (P1 \u2297 Im1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (Pt \u2297 Imt ),\nwhere P1 , . . . , Pt are nonisometric indecomposable representations of Q\u2212 , P1\nis the zero representation of dimension e1 , and\nm1 \u2265 0, m2 > 0, . . . , mt > 0.\nClearly,\nH \u2212 = (P1 \u2297 Im1 +1 ) \u2295 (P2 \u2297 Im2 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (Pt \u2297 Imt ).\nLet\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nS = (S1 , S2 , . . . ) : H \u2192 H.\n\nSince S : H \u2212 \u2192 H \u2212 , by Theorem 3.1(a)\n\nS = (1P1 \u2297 U1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (1Pt \u2297 Ut ),\n(d11 )\n\nS1 = U1\n\n(d1t )\n\n\u2295 * * * \u2295 Ut\n20\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere\n(d1j , . . . , dpj ) = dim(Pj )\nand Uj is a unitary matrix (1 \u2264 j \u2264 t). Since\nS1 H \u03b1 = H \u03b1 S1 ,\nH\u03b1 is a Jordan block and S1 is a unitary matrix, we have S1 = aI, a \u2208 C. The\nrepresentation A is indecomposable, so that d1j 6= 0 and by (12) Uj = aI for\nall 1 \u2264 j \u2264 t. Hence S = a1H and H is indecomposable by Theorem 3.1(b).\n2) There remains the case m11 = 0. Let\n\u03b11 : j1 \u2192 1, . . . , \u03b1l : jl \u2192 1\nbe all the arrows stopping at 1. We denote by A\u2212 the restriction of A on the\nsubquiver\nQ\u2212 := Q \\ {1; \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1l }.\nBy Theorem 3.1(a), we may assume that\nA\u2212 = (P1 \u2297 Im1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (Pt \u2297 Imt ),\nwhere P1 , . . . , Pt are nonisometric indecomposable unitary representations of\nQ\u2212 .\n\u223c\nLet (S2 , . . . , Sp ) : A\u2212 \u2192 A\u2212 .

Taking into account that\n\u00c3\u03b1\u03c4 = S1\u22121 A\u03b1\u03c4 Sj\u03c4\nand partitioning the sets of columns of every A\u03b1\u03c4 and \u00c3\u03b1\u03c4 in the same manner\nas Sj\u03c4 , we obtain\nB := [A\u03b11 | * * * |A\u03b1l ] = [B1 | * * * |Bm ]\n21\n\n\fand\nB\u0303 := [\u00c3\u03b11 | * * * |\u00c3\u03b1l ] = [B\u03031 | * * * |B\u0303m ],\nwhere\nm=\n\nl\nX\n\u03c4 =1\n\n(dj\u03c4 1 + * * * + dj\u03c4 t )\n\nand\nB\u0303i = S1\u22121 Bi Uf (i)\nfor a certain f (i) \u2208 {1, . . . , t}.\nLet z1 \u00d7 ui be the size of Bi and put\nri = rank[B1 | * * * |Bi\u22121 |Bi+1 | * * * |Bm ].\nB is a z1 \u00d7 \u22061 (z) matrix and z1 < \u22061 (z), so z1 \u2212 ri < ui for a certain i. Since\nS1 and Uf (i) are arbitrary unitary matrices, by Lemma 2.1(a) there exists S\nsuch that\n\u0014\n\u0015\nC1 * * * Ci\u22121 Ci Ci+1 * * * Cm\nB\u0303 =\n,\n0 ***\n0\nD\n0\n***\n0\nwhere the rows of\n\n[C1 | * * * |Ci\u22121 |Ci+1 | * * * |Cm ]\nare linearly independent and D is a (z1 \u2212 ri ) \u00d7 ui matrix of the form\ndiag(a1 , . . . , an ) \u2295 0kh\nwith real a1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 an > 0.

Recall that\nto circles correspond positive real numbers in A\u221e , and to stars correspond\ncomplex numbers; the other entries in A\u221e are zeros.\nKac [7, Theorem C] proved that the maximal number of paremeters in\nan indecomposable (non-unitary) representation of dimension d over an algebraically closed field is 1 \u2212 \u03c6Q (d), where\n\u03c6Q (x) = x21 + * * * + x2p \u2212\n\np\nX\n\nmij xi xj\n\ni,j=1\n\nis a Z-bilinear form called the Tits form of the quiver Q, and mij is the\nnumber of arrows i \u2192 j and i \u2190 j.\nWe say that a zone (see page 9) is in general position if all its diagonal\nentries are distinct and, if it is an equivalence zone, nonzero. A unitary\nrepresentation A is said to be in general position if all zones in A\u221e are in\ngeneral position.\nTheorem 3.3. (a) For every d \u2208 D(Q) (see page 18) there exists an indecomposable canonical unitary d representation of general position, its scheme\nis uniquely determined by d.\nP\n(b) An indecomposable unitary d representation A has\ndi \u2212 1 real parameters and at most\n1X\n1 \u2212 \u03c6Q (d) +\ndi (di \u2212 1)\n2\ncomplex parameters; this number is reached if and only if A is in general\nposition.\nProof. We consider the set of zones of a canonical unitary representation\n\u221e\nA\u221e = (A\u221e\n\u03b11 , . . . , A\u03b1q ) as linearly ordered:\nZ1 < Z2 if i1 < i2 ; or i1 = i2 and l1 < l2 ;\nor i1 = i2 , l1 = l2 and Bl(Z1 ) < Bl(Z2 )\n\n(13)\n\n(see (2) and Section 2.2); where Zk (k = 1, 2) is a zone of depth lk in A\u221e\n\u03b1i .\nk\n\n24\n\n\f(a) Let d \u2208 D(Q). By Theorem 3.2, there exists an indecomposable unitary d representation A. Let A be not in general position, and let Z be\nthe first (in the sense of (13)) zone of A\u221e that is not in general position.\nChanging diagonal entries of Z, we transform it into a zone Z\u0303 of general\nposition and A\u221e into a new representation \u00c3. This exchange narrows down\nthe set of admissible transformations that preserve all zones \u2264 Z, and, by\nTheorem 3.1(b), A\u221e has only scalar autometries (as an indecomposable representation), therefore, \u00c3 has only scalar autometries and is indecomposable\ntoo.\nIf \u00c3 is not in general position, we repeat this process for it, and so on,\nuntil we obtain an indecomposable d representation B of general position.\nIts scheme is uniquely determined since, for each zone Z of B, the set of\nadmissible transformations that preserve all zones \u2264 Z (and hence the matrix\nproblem for the remaining part of B) does not depend on diagonal entries of\nZ such that it is in general position.\n(b) Let A be an indecomposable canonical d representation, and Z be its\nzone or the symbol \u221e.
