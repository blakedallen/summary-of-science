INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum cosmology is most elusive as the role of time [3] is not unique and one is being unable to define the\nHilbert space. This is due to the fact that 'time' is not an external parameter in general theory of relativity, rather\nit is intrinsically contained in the theory, unlike its role in quantum mechanics or quantum field theory in flat\nspace time. In curved space time, different slices correspond to different choices of time leading to inequivalent\nquantum theories. Likewise, the canonical quantization of gravity is devoid of an unique time variable and hence\nthe definition of probability of emergence of a particular Universe out of an ensemble is ambiguous. The canonical\nquantization of Einstein-Hilbert action together with some matter fields yields the Wheeler-deWitt equation which\ndoes not contain time a priori, although it emerges intrinsically through the scale factor of the Universe. However, if\nthe canonical variable is so chosen that one of the true degrees of freedom is disentangled from the kinetic part of the\ncanonical variables, then this kinetic part in the corresponding quantum theory yields a quantum mechanical flavour\nof time. This is possible only if the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by curvature squared action or modified by the\nintroduction of curvature squared term, in the Robertson-Walker minisuperspace model. In a recent publication [2]\nwe have presented such a choice of the canonical variable in a curvature squared action whose quantization yields a\nSchr\u00f6dinger like equation. Further, as a consequence, we could identify the nature of the space and time like variables\nin the Robertson-Walker minisuperspace model from the equation of continuity and hence could establish the idea of\nthe probability and the current densities in the context of quantum cosmology.\nThe relevance of the fourth order gravity theory in cosmology was first revealed by Starobinsky [4], though it\nappeared earlier in the context of quantum field theory in curved space time. Starobinsky [4] presented a solution of\nthe inflationary scenerio without invoking phase transition in the very early Universe, from a field equation containing\nonly the geometric terms. However, the field equations could not be obtained from the action principle, as the terms\nin the field equations are generated from the perturbative quantum field theory. Later, Starobinsky and Schmidt\n[5] have shown that the inflationary phase is an attractor in the neighbourhood of the fourth order gravity theory.\nSuch wonderful relevance of higher order gravity theory in the context of cosmology inspired some authors to give\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail:aks@juphys.ernet.in\ne-mail:bmodak@klyuniv.ernet.in\n\n1\n\n\finterpretation of the quantum cosmological wavefunction with R2 [6] and even R3 [7] terms in the Einstein-Hilbert\naction.\nFurther the functional integral for the wavefunction of the Universe proposed by Hartle-Hawking [8] runs into\nserious problem, since the wavefunction diverges badly. There are some prescriptions [9] to avoid such divergences,\nthough a completely satisfactory result has not yet been obtained. However, to get a convergent functional integral,\nHorowitz [10] proposed an action in the form\nZ\n\u221a\n2\nS = d4 X g[ACijkl\n+ B(R \u2212 4\u03bb)2 ]\n(1)\nwhere Cijkl is the Weyl tensor, R is the Ricci scalar, \u03bb is the cosmological constant and A, B are the coupling constants.\nThe action (1) reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action at the weak energy limit [10]. To obtain a workable and simplified\nform of the field equations, one may consider a spatially homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspace background, for\nwhich the Weyl tensor trivially vanishes. In a previous paper [2], we considered the action (1) retaining only the\ncurvature squared term. The field equations for such an action can be obtained by the standard variational principle.\nIn the variational principle, the total derivative terms in the action are extracted and one gets a surface integral which\nis assumed to vanish at the boundary or the action is chosen in such a way that those surface integral terms have\nno contribution. However, for canonical quantization this principle is not of much help and one has to express the\naction in the canonical form, which is achieved only through the introduction of the auxiliary variable. Auxiliary\nvariable can be chosen in an adhoc manner, and different choice of such variable would lead to different description of\nquantum dynamics, keeping the classical field equations unchanged. In view of this Ostrogradski [11] in one hand and\nBoulware etal [1] on the other, have made definite prescriptions to choose such variables. Ostrogradski's prescription\n[11] was followed by Schmidt [12]. We shall consider Boulware etal's [1] prescription in which it was proposed that the\nauxiliary variable should be chosen by taking the first derivative of the action with respect to the highest derivative\nof the field variable present in the action.\nHawking and Luttrell [13] utilized Boulware etal's [1] technique to identify the new variable and showed that the\nEinstein-Hilbert action along with a curvature squared term reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a massive\nscalar field, assuming the conformal factor. Horowitz [10] on the other hand, showed that the canonical quantization\nof the curvature squared action yields an equation which is similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Pollock [14] also\nused the same technique to the induced theory of gravity and obtained the same type of result as that obtained by\nHorowitz [10], in the sense that the corresponding Wheeler-deWitt equation looks similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThe striking feature of Boulware etal's [1] prescription is that it can even be applied in situations where introduction\nof the auxiliary variable is not at all required, eg. in the induced theory of gravity, vacuum Einstein-Hilbert action etc.\nIt is not difficult to see that the classical field equations remain unchanged with or without the introduction of the\nauxiliary variables. Now the question is whether quantum dynamics remain unaffected? Putting other way round, the\nquestion turns out to be whether the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger like equation obtained by Pollock [14] in the induced\ntheory of gravity by introducing auxiliary variable will satisfy the Wheeler-deWitt equation corresponding to the same\naction that can be obtained without introducing such variable? The answer is simply no. We have shown [2] that\nthe introduction of an auxiliary variable does not change the classical field equations in situation mentioned above,\nhowever, the quantum dynamics are different. The vacuum Einstein-Hilbert action in the background of RobertsonWalker metric has been chosen for this purpose. We have shown in such a toy model [2], 'toy', since it is not required\nto follow Boulware etal's [1] prescription in the vacuum Einstein-Hilbert action, that the introduction of an auxiliary\nvariable leads to wrong Wheeler-deWitt equation. So what went wrong with Boulware etal's [1] prescription? This\nis what we have concluded in [2], that before taking up the said prescription, one has to eliminate all possible total\nderivative terms from the action. Once this is done, it would not at all be possible to introduce auxiliary variables in\nsituations mentioned above, where such introduction is unnecessary, and hence only a unique and correct quantum\ndynamics would emerge. In this sense, the auxiliary variable identified by Hawking and Luttrell [13] and Schr\u00f6dinger\nlike equation obtained by Horowitz [10] and Pollock [14] are wrong. We [2] have obtained the correct quantum\ndynamics for curvature squared action and showed that the continuity equation identifies the nature of space and\ntime like variables in the minisuperspace, establishing, perhaps for the first time the quantum mechanical idea of the\nprobability and the current densities in quantum cosmology. It has also been shown that the correct description of the\ncurvature squared action leads to an effective potential, whose extremum yields vacuum Einstein's equation, which is\na desirable feature of higher derivative gravity theory, in the weak energy limit. The emergence of the Schr\u00f6dinger like\nequation, the quantum mechanical concept of the probability density and the effective potential lead us to conclude\nthat the quantum description of cosmology is incomplete without atleast a curvature squared term in the action. This\nis the reason why in this paper we have taken up the task of generalizing our previous work [2] by modifying the\nEinstein-Hilbert action with a curvature squared term along with a matter field.\nAs already mentioned, in order to obtain the correct and unique quantum cosmological description of a system whose\naction contains curvature squared term, one has to first remove all possible total derivative terms from the action and\n2\n\n\fthen follow Boulware etal's [1] prescription. The whole formulation requires four steps, viz. 1) remove all possible\ntotal derivative terms from the action, 2) introduce auxiliary variable, which is the first derivative of the action with\nrespect to the highest derivative of the field variable present in the action, 3) cast the action in the canonical form\nand obtain classical field equations, 4) introduce basic variables to canonically quantize the Hamiltonian constraint\nequation. At this stage we would like to mention that the Hamiltonian in our formalism before introducing basic\nvariables [2] turned out to be the same as that obtained by Schmidt [12] following Ostrogradski's [11] prescription.\nThis is due to the fact that, in that prescription [11] total derivative terms do not appear. However, the importance\nof removal of the total derivative terms has not been stressed, the method of introducing auxiliary variables and\nprocess of casting the action in the canonical form is not so vivid and elegant as in Boulware etal's [1] formalism and\nquantization procedure by introducing basic variables has not been mentioned in that approach [11]. Therefore we\nhave selected the other method.\nThis paper has been organized in the following manner. In section 2. we present the field equation for an action\ncontaining curvature and curvature squared term along with a minimally coupled matter field, following the proposal\nmentioned above. Further we cast the action in canonical form with respect to the basic variables, which shows the\nappearence of a Hamiltonian \u2212P\u03b1 of a system described by the basic variables and their conjugate momenta, though\nthe actual Hamiltonian H ie. the super Hamiltonian constraint to vanish. The form of the above action also identifies\nthe time variable, which is the intrinsic time, whose canonical momentum is P\u03b1 , or the Hamiltonian \u2212P\u03b1 can be\nthought of as the generator of the translation along the above time variable. The action written in this form indicates\nthe true dynamical degree of freedom, disentangled from the kinetic variable ie. the time variable. We claim that the\nHamiltonian (\u2212P\u03b1 ) is the correct Hamiltonian in the sense that it contains the basic variables and their conjugate\nmomenta and its canonical quantization yields the Wheeler-deWitt equation which mimics the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nalong with an effective potential.\nIn section 3. we present the conventional continuity equation of quantum mechanics from the Schr\u00f6dinger like\nWheeler-deWitt equation. The continuity equation in quantum cosmology was first presented by Sanyal and Modak\n[2] only in a recent publication and it is interesting to note that, as the probability and current densities are finite, so\nalso the wavefunction and its derivatives are finite throughout the evolution of the Universe if and only if there are\nno singularities in the domain of quantum cosmology.\nSection 4. has been devoted to extract physical implication of the effective potential Ve . There are singularities\nin the effective potential. It is the function of the scalar field and the expansion parameter, which is the Hubble\nparameter of the classical field equations and it is diverging both at the zero's and at the very large values of the\nexpansion parameter. The effective potential is asymetric with respect to the expansion and collapse of the Universe\nand its extremum yields classical equations.\nSection 5. is devoted in making some concluding remarks.\nII. CLASSICAL FIELD EQUATIONS AND QUANTIZATION\n\nWe consider the following action\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g[\u2212\n\n1\n\u03b2\n1 1\n(R \u2212 R2 ) + 2 ( \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bc \u2212 V (\u03c6))].\n16\u03c0G\n6\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(2)\n\nUnder the following form of the closed Robertson-Walker metric\nds2 = e2\u03b1(\u03b7) [d\u03b7 2 \u2212 d\u03c72 \u2212 sin2 \u03c7(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )]\nthe action (2) can be expressed as\nZ\n3\u03c0\n1\nS = d\u03b7[\n{(1 + \u03b1\u03072 + \u03b1\u0308)e2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2(1 + \u03b1\u03072 + \u03b1\u0308)2 } + \u03c6\u03072 e2\u03b1 \u2212 V (\u03c6)e4\u03b1 ],\n4G\n2\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, \u03b1\u0307 = d\u03b1\nd\u03b7 . According to our proposal, we remove all removable total derivative terms from the action, so that\nonly lowest order terms appear in the action (4). Thus,\nZ\n1\n(5)\nS = d\u03b7[M {(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03072 )e2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2(1 + \u03b1\u03072 )2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b1\u03082 } + \u03c6\u03072 e2\u03b1 \u2212 V (\u03c6)e4\u03b1 ] + Sm ,\n2\n3\n\n3\u03c0\nwhere, M = 4G\nand sm = M [\u03b1\u0307e2\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2(\u03b1\u0307 + \u03b1\u03073 )].\nAt this stage, we define the auxiliary variable, which is\n\n3\n\n\fM \u03b2Q = \u2212\n\n\u2202S\n= 2M \u03b2 \u03b1\u0308, ie.Q = 2\u03b1\u0308.\n\u2202 \u03b1\u0308\n\n(6)\n\nIntroducing the auxiliary variable Q in action (5) and expressing the action in the canonical form, after removing the\nremaining total derivative terms, we obtain,\nZ\n1\n\u03b2\n(7)\nS = d\u03b7[M {\u03b2 Q\u0307\u03b1\u0307 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03072 )e2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2(1 + \u03b1\u03072 )2 + Q2 } + \u03c6\u03072 e2\u03b1 \u2212 V (\u03c6)e4\u03b1 ] + Sm1 ,\n4\n2\nwhere, Sm1 is the surface integral, given by Sm1 = Sm \u2212 \u03b2Q\u03b1\u0307. Assuming Sm1 vanishes at the boundary, the classical\nfield equations are found as,\n\u03b2(Q\u0308 \u2212 12\u03b1\u0308\u03b1\u03072 \u2212 4\u03b1\u0308) \u2212 2e2\u03b1 (1 + \u03b1\u03072 + \u03b1\u0308) \u2212\n\ne2\u03b1 2\n(\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 4V (\u03c6)e2\u03b1 ) = 0,\nM\n\nQ = 2\u03b1\u0308,\n\u03c6\u0308 + 2\u03b1\u0307\u03c6\u0307 + e2\u03b1\n\n\u03b2(3\u03b1\u03074 + 2\u03b1\u03072 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307Q\u0307 +\n\ndV\n= 0,\nd\u03c6\n\ne2\u03b1 1 2\nQ2\n\u2212 1) + (\u03b1\u03072 + 1)e2\u03b1 =\n( \u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6)e2\u03b1 ),\n4\nM 2\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nthe last one being the Hamiltonian constraint equation. The definition of Q given in the equation (6) is thus recovered\nin equation (9). While equation (10) is the well known continuity equation of the scalar field \u03c6, equations (8) and\n(11) are the correct classical field equations as it is evident by replacing Q by 2\u03b1\u0308. Now the Hamiltonian constraint\nequation in the phase space variables can be expressed as,\nH=\n\nP\u03c62 e\u22122\u03b1\nPQ2\nPQ4\nP\u03b1 PQ\nM\n(2\u03b2 + e2\u03b1 ) +\n+ 3 3+\n+ M \u03b2 \u2212 M e2\u03b1 \u2212\n\u03b2Q2 + V (\u03c6)e4\u03b1 = 0,\n2\nM\u03b2\nM \u03b2\nM\u03b2\n2\n4\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, P\u03b1 , PQ and P\u03c6 are the canonical momenta corresponding to \u03b1, Q and \u03c6 respectively, and \u03b1\u0307, Q\u0307 and \u03c6\u0307 are given\nby\n\u03b1\u0307 =\n\n4PQ3\nP\u03b1\n2(2\u03b2 + e2\u03b1 )\nPQ\nPQ + 3 3 .\n, \u03c6\u0307 = e\u22122\u03b1 P\u03c6 , Q\u0307 =\n+\n2\nM\u03b2\nM\u03b2\nM\u03b2\nM \u03b2\n\n(13)\n\nThe Wheeler-deWitt equation is obtained through the quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint equation (12). Now\nas already mentioned, canonical quantization should be performed with the basic variables, viz. \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0307. Let us\nchoose \u03b1\u0307 = x, and hence replace PQ by M \u03b2x, in view of the first equation given in (13). Further, from equation (6),\nwe get\nM \u03b2Q = \u2212\n\n\u2202S\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n=\u2212\n=\u2212\n= \u2212Px ,\n\u2202 \u03b1\u0308\n\u2202 \u03b1\u0308\n\u2202 \u1e8b\n\n(14)\n\nPx\n. From equation (14) it is evident that Px is the canonical momentum\nwhich means that Q should be replaced by \u2212 M\u03b2\ncorresponding to x. Hence equation (12) turns out to be\n\nH = xP\u03b1 \u2212\n\nPx2\n1\n+ P\u03c62 e\u22122\u03b1 + M \u03b2(1 + x2 )2 + M (x2 \u2212 1)e2\u03b1 + V (\u03c6)e4\u03b1 .\n4M \u03b2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nAs the Hamiltonian H is constraint to vanish, we get\n\u2212 P\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n1 \u22122\u03b1 2 M \u03b2\nM 2\nV (\u03c6)e4\u03b1\nPx2\n+\ne\nP\u03c6 +\n(1 + x2 )2 +\n(x \u2212 1)e2\u03b1 +\n.\n4M \u03b2x 2x\nx\nx\nx\n\n(16)\n\nWe have already mentioned that P\u03b1 , P\u03c6 and Px are the canonical momenta corresponding to \u03b1, \u03c6 and x, respectively,\nhowever to understand the physical meaning of P\u03b1 , we write the action (7) in terms of the canonical coordinates,\napart from a surface term, remembering H = 0, as\n4\n\n\fS=\n\nZ\n\nLd\u03b7 =\n\nZ\n\n[P\u03b1 \u03b1\u0307 + PQ Q\u0307 + P\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307]d\u03b7\n\n(17)\n\nFurther, from equation (14) we find\nQ\u0307 = \u2212\n\n\u03b1\u0307 dPx\n1 dPx\n=\u2212\n.\nM \u03b2 d\u03b7\nM \u03b2 d\u03b1\n\n(18)\n\nd\u03c6\n\u03b1\u0307\nNow using the expressions for PQ and Q\u0307 given by equations (13) and (18) respectively, the relations d\u03b1 = \u03b1\u0307d\u03b7, \u03c6\u0307 = d\u03b1\nin action (17) and finally rearranging terms, we obtain\nZ\nZ\ndx\nd\nd\u03c6\nS = [Px\n+ P\u03c6\n+ P\u03b1 ]d\u03b1 \u2212\n(xP\u03b1 )d\u03b1.\n(19)\nd\u03b1\nd\u03b1\nd\u03b1\n\nApart from the surface term the action (19) looks similar to the conventional form of the action of a mechanical\nsystem described by the configuration space variables x, \u03c6 and their canonical conjugate momenta Px , P\u03c6 , with a\nHamiltonian (\u2212P\u03b1 ), which is also the canonical momentum of \u03b1 parametrized by the variable \u03b1, though the true\nHamiltonian H of the gravitational system constraint to vanish. We know that the Hamiltonian of a system is the\ngenerator of the time translation. Since, \u2212P\u03b1 in our system plays the role of the Hamiltonian, hence it acts as the\ngenerator of translation along \u03b1, and the variable \u03b1 acts as the time variable. This feature is also consistent with\nthe intrinsic concept of general theory of relativity, as time has no independent existence from geometry in describing\ngravitation, rather it is inbuilt in the theory, unlike situations encountered in the conventional classical and quantum\nmechanics, where time is an external parameter. The functional form of the Hamiltonian (\u2212P\u03b1 ) is given by (16) and\nit is a function of x, \u03c6, Px , P\u03c6 and the intrinsic time parameter \u03b1. The canonical quanization of (16) yields\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03c8\nn \u2202\u03c8\nh\u03042\n\u22022\u03c8\nh\u03042 \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u22122\u03b1\ne\n+ Ve \u03c8,\n= \u2212P\u0302\u03b1 \u03c8 =\n( 2 +\n)\u2212\n\u2202\u03b1\n4M \u03b2x \u2202x\nx \u2202x\n2x \u2202\u03c62\n\n(20)\n\nwhere n is the operator ordering index and\nVe = Ve (x, \u03c6, \u03b1) =\n\nM\u03b2 2\nM 2\nV (\u03c6) 4\u03b1\n(x + 1)2 +\n(x \u2212 1)e2\u03b1 +\ne .\nx\nx\nx\n\n(21)\n\nEquation (20) is the correct Wheeler-deWitt equation corresponding to an action, containinng curvature and curvature\nsquared terms along with a minimally coupled scalar field. It looks similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, though it\ndiffers from that obtained by Pollock [14].\nIII. PROBABILITY AND CURRENT DENSITY\n\nOne of the most important feature observed in quantum mechanics is that, the state of a system is described by a\nwavevector belonging to an abstract Hilbert space and the norm of the wavevector must be positive definite or zero.\nThis idea emerged from the interpretation of the probability density to describe a given state from the continuity\nequation which is obtained by using the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Probability interpretation follows from the simple\nmathematical appearence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. No such interpretation of the probability density in general\nexists in quantum cosmology, when the action contains terms linear in the Ricci scalar coupled with some matter\nfield. This is due to the fact that there is no time a priori in the Wheeler-deWitt equation in a gravitational theory\ndescribed by the action (2) with \u03b2 = 0. It is to be noted that the continuity equation along with the conventional\nnotion of the probability density can only be introduced with the proper choice of the canonical variables in such a\nway that the Hamiltonian constraint is quadratic in the canonical momenta along with a term linear in momentum\nwhose canonical coordinate acts as an intrinsic time variable. This type of canonical quantization is possible only\nwhen the action contains atleast a quadratic curvature term.\nEquation (20) can be writtn as\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u01240 \u03c8,\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\u01240 =\n\nn \u2202\n\u22022\nh\u03042 \u22122\u03b1 \u2202 2\nh\u03042\n+ V\u0302e (x, \u03c6, \u03b1).\n( 2+\n)\u2212\ne\n4M \u03b2x \u2202x\nx \u2202x\n2x\n\u2202\u03c62\n5\n\n(23)\n\n\fIt is to be noted that \u01240 operator is hermitian and as a consequence we obtain the continuity equation, viz.\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * J = 0,\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and J are the probability and the current densities respectively for the choice of the operator ordering index\nn = \u22121. \u03c1 and J are given by \u03c1 = \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8 and J = (Jx , J\u03c6 , 0), where\nJx =\n\nih\u0304\n(\u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8x \u2212 \u03c8\u03c8x\u2217 ),\n4M \u03b2x\n\n(25)\n\nih\u0304e\u22122\u03b1 \u2217\n(\u03c8 \u03c8\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8\u03c8\u03c6\u2217 ),\n2x\n\n(26)\n\nJ\u03c6 = \u2212\nand\n\n\u2207=(\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n,\n, 0).\n\u2202x \u2202\u03c6\n\n(27)\n\nOne can also find the continuity equation for other values of the operator ordering index but with respect to a\nnew variable y which is functionally related to x only. It should be mentioned here that the continuity equation in\nquantum cosmology was presented by Sanyal and Modak [2] for the first time in a recent publication. In the present\nwork we have obtained the continuity equation once again. Since the above probability and the current densities are\ndynamical quantities, therefore the wavefunction and its derivatives should remain finite at all epoch of the evolution\nof the Universe, if and only if there are no singularities in the domain of quantum cosmology.\nFurther in analogy with the quantum mechanics it is noted that the variable \u03b1 in equation (20) can be identified\nas the time parameter in quantum cosmology. The variables x(= \u03b1\u0307) and \u03c6 act as spatial coordinate variables in\nthe context of quantum cosmology. The coordinate variable x(= \u03b1\u0307), which is just the expansion parameter and the\nHamiltonian operator \u01240 diverges at the bounce of the Univese, ie. at \u03b1\u0307 = 0.\nIV. EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL AND ITS EXTREMIZATION\n\nThe effective potential given by equation (21) is found to be assymetric with respect to the expansion parameter\n(x), ie. Ve (\u2212x) = \u2212Ve (+x) and it is also unstable both at the short range and the long range values of x.The\nsignificance of the effective potential becomes clear when it is extremized, yielding interesting results. In the weak\nenergy limit, ie. when the deBroglie wavelength is much larger in comparison with the average separation (ie. far\nbelow the Planck scale) the contribution of the kinetic energy is sufficiently small with respect to the potential energy\nin the Hamiltonian . At this regime the Hamiltonian is almost dominated by the potential energy. Now the extremum\nof the effective potential Ve given by equation (21), with respect to x yields, keeping \u03c6 and the time parameter \u03b1\nfixed,\n\u03b2(3x4 + 2x2 \u2212 1) + (x2 + 1)e2\u03b1 \u2212\n\ne4\u03b1\nV (\u03c6) = 0.\nM\n\n(28)\n\nIf V (\u03c6) has got no extremum then in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 0, ie. in the absence of the curvature squared term, equation (28)\ntakes the following form\nx2 + 1 = \u03b1\u03072 + 1 =\n\ne2\u03b1\nV (\u03c6),\nM\n\n(29)\n\nwhich is exactly the classical constraint equation in the Einstein's gravity, along with a scalar field, apart from a\nkinetic energy part corresponding to the scalar field, that we have already assumed to be small. Further, for the\naction dominated by the curvature squared term, ie. at \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, we have\nx2 + 1 = 0,\n\n(30)\n\n1\n= 0.\n3\n\n(31)\n\nor,\nx2 \u2212\n\n6\n\n\fThese pair of equations have already been obtained in [2]. Here, we have just been able to recover them in the limit\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, ie. at the epoch of the evolution of the Universe dominated by the curvature squared term. These equations\nimply that the extremum of the effective potential Ve is at a coordinate position x = \u03b1\u0307, satisfying either equation\n(30), which is the vacuum Einstein's equation that admits Euclidean wormhole solution, or equation (31), which is\n)\n\u221a 0 , 'a' being the scale factor in proper time 't'.\nthe epoch at which the Universe admits a solution, given by a = (t\u2212t\n3\nFor this solution the horizon radious rH is proportionaql to ln(t), and so as t \u2192 0, rH \u2192 \u221e, and thus the horizon\nproblem is solved. The effective potential Ve diverges in both the directions of x \u2192 0 and x \u2192 \u221e, even for \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n2\nFurther, it can be shown that \u2202\u2202xV2e > 0, for condition (31), ie. Ve has got a minimum. These altogether imply that the\nUniverse, while sitting at the minimum of the effective potential, will expand at the rate a proportional to t, solving\nthe horizon problem.\nNow, had there been an extremum of the scalar field potential V (\u03c6), then extremizing the effective potential Ve ,\ngiven in equation (21), with respect to \u03c6, keeping x, \u03b1 fixed, we get\ne4\u03b1 dV\n= 0.\nM x d\u03c6\n\n(32)\n\nThe condition that a function (Ve ) of two variables x, and \u03c6 (not considering the time parameter \u03b1) has got a\nminimum, is\n\u2202 2 Ve \u2202 2 Ve\n\u2202 2 Ve\n\u2212\n> 0.\n2\n2\n\u2202x \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x\u2202\u03c6\n\n(33)\n\nThe left hand side in the present context turns out to be\nd2 V (\u03c6)\n2e4\u03b1 2\u03b1\n[e + 2\u03b2(3x20 + 1)]\n|at\u03c6=\u03c60\n2\nM x0\nd\u03c62\n\n(34)\n\n2\n\nV (\u03c6)\nwhich is positive definite for d d\u03c6\n|at\u03c6=\u03c60 > 0, ie. for a minimum of the scalar field potential. Therefore the effective\n2\npotential has got an extremum located at the configuration space variables \u03c6 = \u03c60 and x = x0 , determined by equation\n(28).\n2\nIt can further be shown that \u2202\u2202xV2e |\u03c6,\u03b1=constant > 0, which means that the effective potential is truely a minimum at\nthe location of the configuration space variables \u03c6 = \u03c60 , x = x0 , determined by equation (28), where V (\u03c6) = V (\u03c60 ).\nFurther, if we choose the minimum of the scalar field potential V (\u03c60 ) = 0, then equation (28) reduces to either\n\nx2 + 1 = 0\n\n(35)\n\n\u03b2(3x2 \u2212 1) + e2\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(36)\n\nor,\n\nthese pair of equations again imply that the Universe is sitting at the minimum of the effective potential Ve , at the\nlocations of the configuration space variables \u03c60 and x = x0 , satisfying either equation (35), which is the vacuum\nEinstein's equation admitting Euclidean wormhole solution, or equation (36), that admits an oscillatory solution, in\nthe form\nt \u2212 t0\na2 = \u03b2sin2 ( \u221a ),\n3\u03b2\n\n(37)\n\nwhere, as already mentioned, 'a' is the scale factor in proper time 't'.\nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn summary, we have observed that, different choice of the auxiliary variable, leads to different inequivalent quantum\ndynamics, keeping the classical field equations unchanged. Hence, we have suggested a principle of choosing the\ncorrect auxiliary variable and the true degree of freedom, which would lead to the correct and unique quantum\ndescription. For this we have modified Boulware etal's principle [1] by adding only one statement at the begining\nthat, before choosing such variables one has to remove all removable total derivative terms from the action. That\nthis would lead to the correct quantum description, has been proved in a toy model, in a recent publication by\n7\n\n\fSanyal and Modak [2]. In addition, it has been shown that the quantum dynamics obtained by this principle leads to\ncertain desirable features viz. quantum mechanical probability and current density interpretation from the continuity\nequation of quantum cosmology and an effective potential whose extremum yields classical field equations. It seems\nthat a quantum mechanical probability interpretation is possible, only if the Einstein-Hilbert action in the RobertsonWalker minisuperspace model is modified by atleast curvature squared term, which appears in the one loop correction\nof perturbative quantum field theory in curved space time, and is the most dominant term in the quantum domain.\nThus we may conclude that, quantum mechanical probability interpretation of quantum cosmology is a generic feature\nof curvature squared gravity, at least in the Robertson-Walker minisuperspace model.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nD.Boulware, A.Strominger and E.T.Tomboulis, Quantum theory of gravity, ed.
