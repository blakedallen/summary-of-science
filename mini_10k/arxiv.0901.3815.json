It is known that DM must be nonbaryonic, nonrelativistic (cold) and nonluminous matter [1]. So it is not one of elementary particles contained\nin the standard moldel (SM). The leading candidate from particle theory is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), since the annihilation cross section can lead to the correct\nthermal residual abundance with the right magnitude. The new stable massive particles\ncould be generated in many extensions of the SM [2][3][4][5][6].\nIn this letter we consider a Dirac fermionic dark matter candidate with mass near electroweak scale (10\u223c1000 GeV), which is supplied as a singlet within the standard model\ncontext. The Dirac particles have four different types of electromagnetic couplings (four\nform factors) in general. Among the four couplings, we expect that magnetic dipole moment (MDM) is sizable for the neutral fermion. The electric charges must be prohibited\nby the unbroken U(1)Q gauge symmetry [7] and the other couplings except for magnetic\ndipole accompany violations of the discrete symmetries. The violations of the discrete symmetries might be sizable for the DM, but the violations have been estimated to be small for\nthe known Dirac particles. We assume that the candidate has the small violations of the\ndiscrete symmetries.\nThe singlet Dirac fermion \u03c8 should couple to the shifted photon (hypercharge gauge\nboson B) near electroweak scale (10\u223c1000 GeV), instead of photon. The Lagrangian with\nthe magnetic dipole moment of B, \u03bcB , is\n1\nLef f = \u03bcB \u03c8\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8B \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(1)\n\nIn the standard model context, the Lagrangian may be expressed about photon and Z\nboson.\n1\nLef f = \u03bc\u03c8\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8(F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 tan \u03b8W Z \u03bc\u03bd )\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F \u03bc\u03bd is the field strength for photon, Z \u03bc\u03bd for Z boson and \u03bc is the magnetic dipole\nmoment1 .\n1\n\nTo be strict, this is a magnetic dipole form factor, F2 (q 2 ). The magnetic dipole moment is defined at\n\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: Feynman diagrams for WIMP pair annihilation into f f , W W, ZH. The hatched circle\nindicates the vertex for the dipole coupling.\n\nII.\n\nANNIHILATION PROCESS\n\nIn the leading order of the magnetic dipole moment, WIMP annihilates into SM particles\n(f f , W W, ZH) via the s-channel \u03b3, Z exchanges, where the Feynman diagrams are given\nin Fig.1. The MDM operator is split into energy and momentum dependent parts by the\nfamiliar Gordon identity.\nv(p\u2032 )\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd u(p) = iv(p\u2032 )(2M\u03b3 \u03bc + (p\u2032 \u2212 p)\u03bc )u(p)\n\n(3)\n\nThe MDM operator has energy dependence. This implies that there is no threshold or\nhelicity suppression due to violations of discrete symmetries. There is also no lepton number\nviolation for this annihilation process, since the candidate is a Dirac particle.

We show the explicit mass dependence of\nfermions.\nFig.2 shows the annihilation fraction as a function of WIMP mass for the final states.\nThe fermionic annihilation products dominate, particularly hadronic annihilation for entire\nparameter space. ZH channel has the small contribution since it interacts with WIMP via\nonly Z-boson. The \u03b3 \u2212 Z interference plays very important role for the W -boson channel2 ,\n2\n\nIf we only consider the interaction with photon, the contribution by W -boson becomes extremely large in\nhigh energies. The interaction with Z -boson avoids this danger.\n\n4\n\n\fsince the W -boson channel contribution results in a significant decrease in high energy due\nto the interference.\n\nIII.\n\nCONSTRAINT FROM RELIC ABUNDANCE\n\nIn the very early universe, these particles would be present in large numbers in thermal\nequilibrium. They could reduce their density only through pair annihilation as universe is\ncool. This pair annihilation would be efficient enough to reduce the present day number\ndensity of WIMP. The time evolution of the relic density is described by the Boltzmann\nequation and we can solve the equation in the approxmate way [8]. After the freeze out, the\nactual number of the dark matter per comoving volume becomes constant and the present\nrelic density is determined. The relic density is roughly\n\u03a9CDM h2 \u2243 \u221a\n\n(1.07 \u00d7 109 )xF\ng\u2217 mP l (GeV)h\u03c3vrel i\n\n(6)\n\nwhere g\u2217 is the effective degrees of freedom in equilibrium, mP l is Planck mass, xF is the\ninverse freeze out temperature and h\u03c3vrel i is the thermal average of annihilation rate.\nThe inverse freeze out temperature has almost no dependence on WIMP mass, xF \u2243 20\nnear electroweak scale. The present relic density of CDM measured from WMAP (Wilkinson\nmicrowave anisotropy probe) data [9] is \u03a9CDM h2 = 0.111\u00b10.012 at the level of 10% accuracy.\nSo the thermal average of annihilation rate is h\u03c3vrel i \u2243 0.62 pb.\nWe take the thermal average for the annihilation obtained with Maxwell-Botzmann statistics, which is described in Ref. [10].\nx\nh\u03c3vrel i =\n5\n8M K22 (x)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n4M 2\n\nds\u03c3(s) s \u2212 4M\n\nwhere Ki is a modified Bessel function of order i.\n\n2\n\n\u0001\u221a\n\nsK1\n\n\u0013\ns\nx\nM\n\n\u0012\u221a\n\n(7)\n\nCombination of Eq. (5) and (7) gives the allowed parameter sets for the magnetic dipole\nmoment of WIMP. Fig.3 shows the allowed parameter sets which satisfy the WMAP measurements for relic density, in the case that the Dirac fermions account for all the observed\ndark matter. So those become the upper limits of WIMP magnetic dipole moment. All the\nannihilation rates of Eq.(5) are included and the known inputs are used as well as Higgs\nmass of 120 GeV.

In this region, the dipoles are relatively small in order to compensate the enhancement of annihilation rate by Z boson resonace effect.

If the dipole comes from new physics\neffect, we predict the new physics with O(\u039b) \u223c 10 TeV.\nIV.\n\nDIRECT DETECTION\n\nThe sensitivity of dark matter is controlled by their elastic scattering with a nucleus\nin a detector. The Feynman diagram which give rise to the WIMP-nucleon interaction is\nshown in Fig.4, which the t-channel exchanges of \u03b3, Z are only possible. For the cold dark\nmatter, the momentum transfer is quite low, |q| \u223c O(MeV)(ER \u223c O(KeV)). The interaction\n\nvia Z boson is 1/m2Z \u223c GF where GF is the Fermi constant, and 1/q 2 for the photon. The\ninteraction via Z boson may be neglected. We thus only consider the interaction via photon.\n\nA.\n\nElastic-scattering cross section\n\nThe effective Lagrangian may be described by four fermion interaction,\nLq = i\n\n\u0001\n\u03bceeq\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c8\u03c3\nq\n\u03c8\n(q\u03b3\u03bc q)\n\u03bd\nq2\n\nwhere e is the electric coupling and eq is an electric charge for the quark q.\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\fN(p' )\n\nN(p )\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03b3,Z(q)\n\u03c8(p'1)\n\n\u03c8(p )\n1\n\nFIG. 4: Feynman diagram relevant to WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering.

The functions Sij encompass the magnitude of the spin\nassociated with the nucleon populations, as well as the effects of the spatial distribution of\nthat spin at nonzero momentum transfers.\nThe WIMP-nucleus differential cross section results in\n\u03bc2 \u03bc2A J + 1 2\nd\u03c3el\n=\nF (|q|)\ndq 2\n6\u03c0v 2 J\nwhere \u03bc2A \u2261\n\n\u00012\ne\nJ\n2m\n\n(13)\n\nS(0) is the magnetic dipole moment of the atomic nucleus and F 2 (|q|) \u2261\n\nS(|q 2 |)/S(0) is the normalized form factor, F 2 (0) = 1.

This causes an yearly modulation\nin the event rate which peaks around June 2nd each year [13]. We take the average velocity,\nvE = 232 km/s.\nWith the relation q 2 = 2mER , Eq.

Among\nthem, we consider the isotope targets, 73 Ge and 131 Xe, which have been used at the most sensitive detectors, CDMS II and XENON10.

The recoil energy ranges are listed\nat Table II for the corresponding detectors.\nFig.5 shows the WIMP-nucleon cross sections from Eq.(15) with the experimental limits\nin the WIMP mass range 10 \u223c 1000 GeV. The predicted curves and the experimental limit\ncontours are for pure proton coupling (an = 0) and pure neutron coupling (ap = 0). The\npredicted curves show a little different from both isotope targets because of the nuclear spin\neffect. The form factors related to the spin structure functions are followed by Dimitrov et\nal.[17] for 73 Ge nucleus and Ressell et al.[18] for 131 Xe nucleus, which are consistent with the\nexperimental measurements for MDM in the reasonable precision. The 73 Ge and 131 Xe nuclei\nboth contain an unpaired neutron, so the sensitivity to pure-neutron coupling is stronger.\nThe predictions are under the current discovery limits for the entire mass range and are\nrelatively close to the experimental limits. We should not discard the WIMP discovery\nthrough the magnetic dipole moment in near future.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nA Dirac fermion which was supplied as a singlet within the standard model context may\nmainly interact with the ordinary matters through magnetic dipole moment (MDM). It must\nbe more general that the candidate couples to the shifted photon (hypercharge gauge boson)\nthan coupling to photon directly near electroweak scale 10 \u223c 1000 GeV. Assuming that the\nDirac fermions account for all the observed dark matter, the MDM constrained by the relic\ndensity may be as large as 10\u221218 \u223c 10\u221217 e cm. The WIMP with nonzero MDM interacts\nwith targets through MDM of the target nuclei and the cross sections are under the current\nexperimental limits.

The\nlight dotted lines are the exclusion limits from the XENON10 experiment and the solid lines from\nCDMS II experiment. Also shown by dash-dotted lines are the experimental sensitivities of the\nplanned detector SuperCDMS, respectively.\n\ndetection of the WIMP through MDM should be considered be in near future.\nBesides the direct search of WIMP, there are several experiments to search for dark\nmatter indirectly, such like neutrino telescopes, \u03b3-ray telescopes and antimatter telescopes.\nThey might give the more serious constraints [19], but the indirect searches for dark matter\naccompany uncertain informations in astrophysics. This scenario, which the dark matter has\nDirac fermionic nature and mainly interacts with the ordinary matters through the magnetic\ndipole moment, might not be ruled out.\nWe have also studied the possibility of WIMP detection with the method of a photon or\njet tagging in ILC and LHC. Several tens or hundreds of WIMP events are expected, but\nthese signals suffer the huge irreducible background come from the neutrino channel. So the\n\n11\n\n\fexpected signals are swamped by the irreducible background.\n\n[1] A. Lange et al., Phys. Rev. D 63, 042001 (2001) [arXiv:astro-ph/0005004 ] ; N.W. Halverson\net al., Astrophys. J.
