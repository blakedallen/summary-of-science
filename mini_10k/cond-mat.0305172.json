Although cryptosystems in general have an extensive history, until fairly\nrecently they have been based on simple variations of the same theme: information security among authorized parties\nrelies on sharing a secret key which is to be used for encryption and decryption of transmitted messages. While in this\nway confidentiality of the sent message may be secured, such systems suffer from the (obvious) drawback of non-secure\nkey distribution.\nIn 1978 Rivest, Shamir and Adleman first devised a way to resolve this problem which led to the celebrated RSA\npublic-key cryptosystem [1] (for historical accuracy, a similar system has been suggested years earlier in the British\nGCHQ but was kept secret). The idea behind public key cryptosystems is to differentiate between the encryption- and\ndecryption-keys; private key(s) are assigned to authorized users, for decryption purposes, while transmitting parties\nonly need to know the matching encryption (public) key [2]. The two keys are related by a function which generates the\nencryption mechanism from the decryption key with low computational costs, while the opposite operation (evaluating\nthe decryption key from the encryption mechanism) is computationally infeasible. Such functions are called 'one-way'\nor trap-door functions; the RSA algorithm for instance, is based on the intractability of factorizing large integers\ngenerated by taking the product of two large prime numbers.\nThe proliferation of digital communication in the last few decades has brought in a demand for secure communication leading to the invention of several other public-key cryptosystems, most notable of which are the El-Gammal\ncryptosystem (based on the Discrete Logarithm problem), systems based on elliptic curves and the McEliece cryptosystem (based on linear error-correcting codes) [3]. A common denominator of all public-key algorithms is the high\ncomputational complexity of the task facing the unauthorized user; this is typically related to hard computational\nproblems that cannot be solved in practical time scales.\nA new public-key cryptosystem based on a diluted Ising spin-glass system has been recently proposed in [4]. The\nsuggested cryptosystem is similar in spirit to that of McEliece and relies on exploiting physical properties of the\nMacKay-Neal (MN) low-density parity-check (LDPC) error-correcting codes. In particular, in the context of MN\ncodes it has been shown [4, 5, 6] that for certain parameter values successful decoding is highly likely, while for\nothers (particularly when the number of parity-checks per bit and the number of bits per check tend to infinity) the\n'perfect' solution, describing full retrieval of the sent message, admits only a very narrow basin of attraction; iterative\nalgorithmic solutions lead in this case, almost certainly, to a decryption failure. One can use these properties to\ndevise an LDPC based cryptosystem [4]. The narrow basin of attraction ensures that a random initialization of the\ndecryption equations will fail to converge to the plaintext solution while the naive approach of trying all possible\ninitializations is clearly doomed for a sufficiently large plaintext size. The 'one-way' function relies on the hard\ncomputational task of decomposing a dense matrix (the public key) into a combination of sparse and dense matrices\n(private keys) [7].\nIn this paper we examine the suggested cryptosystem from an adversary's viewpoint. We consider an unauthorized\nparty that has acquired partial or full knowledge of one or more of the private keys, and/or of the message, and we\nevaluate the critical knowledge levels required for unauthorized decryption. In addition, we examine the decryption\nreliability by authorized users due to the probabilistic nature of the cryptosystem.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In the following section we give an outline of the suggested cryptosystem. In\nsection III we formulate unauthorized-decryption scenarios with partial knowledge based on a statistical mechanical\n\n\f2\nframework. In section IV we derive the observable quantity that measures decryption success of the unauthorized user\nas a function of the attack parameters and in section V we examine various cases and present numerical results as well\nas the related phase diagrams. In sections VI and VII we briefly study the basin of attraction of the ferromagnetic\nsolution, and the reliability of the decryption mechanism (for authorized users), respectively. The implication of the\nanalysis are discussed in section VIII.\nII.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CRYPTOSYSTEM\n\nThe cryptosystem suggested in [4] is based on the framework of MN error-correcting codes [5]. An outline of the\nencryption/decryption process is as follows.\nA plaintext represented by \u03be \u2208 {0, 1}N is encrypted to the ciphertext r \u2208 {0, 1}M (with M > N ) using a predetermined generator matrix G \u2208 {0, 1} and a corrupting vector \u03b6 \u2208 {0, 1}M with P (\u03b6i ) = p \u03b4\u03b6i ,1 + (1 \u2212 p) \u03b4\u03b6i ,0 for each\ncomponent 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M ; the Kronecker tensor \u03b4ab returns 1 when the arguments are equal (a = b) and zero otherwise.\nThe generated ciphertext is of the form:\nr = G\u03be + \u03b6\n\n(mod 2)\n\n(1)\n\nThe (M \u00d7 N ) matrix G together with the corruption rate p \u2208 [0, 1] constitute the public key.\nThe encryption matrix G is constructed by choosing a dense matrix D (of dimensionality M \u00d7M ) and two randomlyselected sparse matrices A (of dimensionality M \u00d7 N ) and B (of dimensionality M \u00d7 M ) through G = B \u22121 AD (mod\n2). The matrices A and B are characterized by K and L non-zero elements per row and C and L non-zero elements\nper column respectively. The resulting dense matrix G is modeled as being characterized by K \u2032 and C \u2032 non-zero\nelements per row and per column respectively with K \u2032 , C \u2032 \u2192 \u221e (while K \u2032 /C \u2032 = N/M is finite). In fact, the dense\nmatrix G is of an irregular form due to the inverse of the sparse matrix B as well as the product taken with the dense\nmatrix D; we will model the matrix G by a regular dense matrix to simplify the analysis. The parameters K, C and\nL define a particular cryptosystem while the matrices A, B and D constitute the private key.\nThe authorized user may obtain the plaintext from the received ciphertext r by taking the (mod 2) product\nBr = A\u03be + B\u03b6. Finding a set of solutions \u03c3 and \u03c4 such that the equation\nA\u03c3 + B\u03c4 = A\u03be + B\u03b6\n\n(mod 2)\n\n(2)\n\nis true will lead to candidate solutions of the decryption problem (of which the most probable one will be detected\naccording to a further selection criterion). For particular choices of K and L, solving the above equation can be\nachieved via iterative methods which have common roots in both graphical models and physics of disordered systems\nsuch as Belief Propagation [5] Belief Revision [8] and more recently Survey Propagation [9]; where state probabilities\nfor the decrypted message bits P (\u03c3, \u03c4 |r) are calculated by solving iteratively a set of coupled equations, describing\nconditional probabilities of the ciphertext bits given the plaintext and vice versa. This problem is identical to the\ndecoding problem of a regular MN error-correcting code; for the explicit iterative decoding equations see equations (5556) as well as [5, 10].\nThe unauthorized user, on the other hand, faces the task of finding the most probable solutions to the equation\nG\u03be + \u03b6 = G\u03c3 + \u03c4\n\n(mod 2) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe above decryption equation is effectively identical to the decoding problem of Sourlas error-correcting codes [11],\nwith the public matrix G being dense. Most notably, in the context of Sourlas codes, finding solutions to (3) is strongly\ndependent on initial conditions: for all initial conditions other than the plaintext itself, the iterative equations of Belief\nPropagation will fail to converge to the plaintext solution [4, 5, 6, 12] such that obtaining the correct solution for (3)\nwithout knowledge of the private key will become infeasible. Obtaining the private keys by decomposing G into A, B\nand D is known to be a hard computational problem even if the values of K, C and L are known [7].\nWe would like to point to the fact that there may exist more than one triplet of matrices {A, B, D} such that\nG = B \u22121 AD. with D being a dense matrix, finding a set of matrices A\u2032 , B \u2032 and D\u2032 such that their combination\nproduces G = (B \u2032 )\u22121 A\u2032 D\u2032 requires an exponentially diverging number of operations, with respect to the system size,\nmaking the decomposition computationally infeasible. For D = 1 (as was the original formulation in [4]) finding a\npair of sparse matrices A\u2032 and B \u2032 such that G = (B \u2032 )\u22121 A\u2032 requires only a number of operations that is polynomial in\nN , and the cryptosystem is therefore not secure.\nOther advantages and drawbacks of the new cryptosystem appear in [4].\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nFORMULATION OF THE ATTACK\n\nAn essential ingredient of any cryptosystem is a certain level of robustness against attacks. The robustness of the\ncurrent cryptosystem against attacks with no additional secret information has already been reported in [4]. In this\nsection we study the vulnerability of the new cryptosystem to various attacks, characterized by partial knowledge of\nthe secret keys and/or the plaintext itself; the additional information manifests itself in a set of decryption equations\nsimilar to (2) in which partial information of the secret keys (and plaintext) is used in conjunction with the publicly\navailable information of (3).\n\nThe cumulative information provided by the different sets of equations will potentially allow for a successful decryption.\nTo this extent, knowledge of the matrix B is of utmost importance since obtaining partial knowledge of the syndrome\nvector and equation (2) is only accessible through decryption using the matrix B. Let us consider that an unauthorized\nuser has acquired knowledge of a number of rows \u03b3A M , \u03b3B M and \u03b3D M of the secret matrices A, B and D (with\n\u03b3\u22c6 \u2208 [0, 1]). Relation (2) then provides \u03b3M \u2261 min{\u03b3A , \u03b3B , \u03b3D }M decryption equations (4) based on sparse matrices.\nTo analyze the attack we will thus from now on assume that a block (\u03b3M \u00d7 M ) of all matrices is known to the\nP\nunauthorized user with \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1]. In this case, the products M\nj=1 Bij rj for i = 1, . . . , \u03b3M can be taken and the\nunauthorized user will arrive at the following decryption problem:\nprivate : (\u00c2\u03c3)i + (B\u0302\u03c4 )i = (\u00c2\u03be)i + (B\u0302\u03b6)i for rows i = 1, . . . , \u03b3M\npublic : (G\u03c3)i + (I\u03c4 )i = (G\u03be)i + (I\u03b6)i for rows i = 1, . . . , M\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere we absorbed the matrix D using \u03c3 \u2192 D\u03c3 and \u03be \u2192 D\u03be; in practice, after decryption, one will have to use of\nthe inverted matrix D\u22121 to obtain the original plaintext. All solutions \u03c3 and \u03c4 will have to simultaneously satisfy\n(4) and (5). The matrices \u00c2 and B\u0302 will be described by K and L non-zero elements per row. The average number of\nknown non-zero elements per column in \u00c2 and B\u0302 will be denoted C and L, respectively.

This will allow us to disentangle the variables\n{\u03be, \u03b6} from expressions involving the tensors A and G in (16,17). Replacing the \u03b4 functions in (23,24) by their integral\nrepresentations allows us to perform the tensor summations, leading to:\nh \u2206A (\u03c3, \u03c4 ), \u2206G (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) i =\nI QN\nI QM\n1\nj=1 dYj dVj\ni=1 dZi dXi\n=\nNN\u2032\n(2\u03c0)2N\n(2\u03c0)2M\nN D\nM D\nE\nE\nY\nY\n\u2212(L\u0303 +1)\n\u2212(C\u0303 +1) \u2212(C \u2032 +1)\n\u00d7\nZ i i Xi\nYj j Vj\u22122\nP (C\u0303i )\n\ni=1\n\n1 n\n\n\u00d7 e( 2 )\n\n1 n\n\n\u00d7 e( 2 )\n\nPn\n\nm=0\n\nPn\n\nm=0\n\nP\nP\n\n1\nh\u03b11 ***\u03b1m i K!\n\n(\n\n1\nh\u03b11 ***\u03b1m i K \u2032 !\n\nPN\n\n(\n\ni=1\n\nPN\n\nj=1\n\u03b1\n\nK 1\nL!\n\nZi \u03c3i 1 ***\u03c3i\u03b1m )\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b1\n\nK\u2032\n\nXi \u03c3i 1 ***\u03c3i\u03b1m )\n\n(\n\n(\n\nPM\n\nj=1\n\nPM\n\nj=1\n\nP (L\u0303j )\n\u03b1\n\nL\n\nYj \u03c4j 1 ***\u03c4j\u03b1m )\n\u03b1\n\nVj \u03c4j 1 ***\u03c4j\u03b1m )\n\n(25)\n\n\f6\nIn the above expression we can now identify the following order parameters\nq\u03b11 ***\u03b1m =\n\nN\nX\n\nZi \u03c3i\u03b11\n\n* * * \u03c3i\u03b1m\n\nr\u03b11 ***\u03b1m =\n\nXi \u03c3i\u03b11 * * * \u03c3i\u03b1m\n\n(26)\n\nVj \u03c4j\u03b11 * * * \u03c4j\u03b1m\n\n(27)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nt\u03b11 ***\u03b1m =\n\nN\nX\n\nM\nX\n\nYj \u03c4j\u03b11 * * * \u03c4j\u03b1m\n\nu\u03b11 ***\u03b1m =\n\nM\nX\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhich we insert in (25) via suitably defined \u03b4 functions (giving rise to the Lagrange multipliers q\u0302\u03b11 ***\u03b1m , r\u0302\u03b11 ***\u03b1m ,\nt\u0302\u03b11 ***\u03b1m and \u00fb\u03b11 ***\u03b1m ). To proceed with the calculation one needs to assume a certain order parameter symmetry for\nthe above quantities and their conjugates for all m > 1. The simplest such assumption renders all replica m-tuples\nequivalent and all order parameters within this replica symmetric scheme need only depend on the number m.

The Nishimori condition (\u03b2 = 1), which corresponds to MPM\ndecoding [14], also ensures that this simplest replica-symmetric scheme is sufficient to describe the thermodynamically\ndominant state [13, 15]. Furthermore, it is worthwhile mentioning that extending the replica symmetric calculation\nto include the one-step replica symmetry breaking ansatz is unlikely to modify the location of the transition points\nidentified under the replica-symmetric ansatz, as has been recently shown in a similar system [16]. Using the above\nansatz we perform the contour integrals in (25), and trace over the spin variables; then, in the limit n \u2192 0 we obtain:\n\u001a\nCL\nC\u2032\n\u2212 \u03b2f = Extr \u2212CJ1a [\u03c0, \u03c0\u0302] \u2212\n(32)\nJ1b [\u03c1, \u03c1\u0302] \u2212 C \u2032 J1c [\u03c6, \u03c6\u0302] \u2212 \u2032 J1d [\u03c8, \u03c8\u0302]\nK\nK\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0012\nC\u2032\nC\u2032\nC\nCL\nC\n+ \u2032 log 2\nJ3b [\u03c1\u0302, \u03c8\u0302] \u2212\n+ J2a [\u03c0, \u03c1] + \u2032 J2b [\u03c6, \u03c8] + J3a [\u03c0\u0302, \u03c6\u0302] +\nK\nK\nKL\nK\nK\nwhere the extremization is taken over the distributions defined in (28-31) and the various integrals J\u22c6\u22c6 are given by\nZ\nZ\nJ1a [\u03c0, \u03c0\u0302] = dxdx\u0302 \u03c0(x)\u03c0\u0302(x\u0302) log(1 + xx\u0302)\nJ1b [\u03c1, \u03c1\u0302] = dyd\u0177 \u03c1(y)\u03c1\u0302(\u0177) log(1 + y \u0177)\n(33)\nJ1c [\u03c6, \u03c6\u0302] =\n\nZ\n\ndxdx\u0302 \u03c6(x)\u03c6\u0302(x\u0302) log(1 + xx\u0302)\n\nJ1d [\u03c8, \u03c8\u0302] =\n\nZ\n\ndyd\u0177 \u03c8(y)\u03c8\u0302(\u0177) log(1 + y \u0177)\n\nZ Y\nK\nL\nY\nY Y\nJ2a [\u03c0, \u03c1] = [\ndxk \u03c0(xk )\ndyl \u03c1(yl )] log(1 +\nxk\nyl )\nk=1\n\nl=1\n\nk\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nl\n\n\u2032\n\nJ2b [\u03c6, \u03c8] =\n\nZ\n\ndy \u03c8(y) [\n\nK\nY\n\nk=1\n\ndxk \u03c6(xk )] log(1 + y\n\nY\nk\n\nxk )\n\n(36)\n\n\f7\n\nJ3a [\u03c0\u0302, \u03c6\u0302] =\n\nZ Y\nC\u2032\n\nd\u03c6\u0302(yc\u2032 )\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)C\n\n\uf8f3\n\nc\u2032 =1\n\n*\n\nlog\n\nX\n\n\u03bb=\u00b1\n\n+\nY\n[(1 \u2212 c) + c\u03b4\u03bb,1 ]e\u03b2F\u03c3 \u03be\u03bb (1 + yc\u2032 \u03bb)\nc\u2032\n\n*Z C\u0303\n*\n+\nY\nX\nY\nY\n+\n[\nd\u03c0\u0302(xc )] log\n[(1 \u2212 c) + c\u03b4\u03bb,1 ]e\u03b2F\u03c3 \u03be\u03c3\n(1 + xc \u03bb) (1 + yc\u2032 \u03bb)\nc=1\n\nJ3b [\u03c1\u0302, \u03c8\u0302] =\n\nZ\n\ndy \u03c8\u0302(y)\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nc\u2032\n\nc\n\n\u03bb=\u00b1\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)L\n\n\uf8f3\n\n*\n\nlog\n\nX\n\n+\n\n\u03bb=\u00b1\n\nl\n\n\u03bb=\u00b1\n\nd,\u03b6\n\nd,\u03b6\n\n+ \uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\nwhere\nC=\n\nC\nX\n\nP (C\u0303; C) C\u0303\n\nC\u0303\n\n(37)\n\n\uf8fe\n\n[(1 \u2212 d) + d\u03b4\u03bb,1 ]e\u03b2F\u03c4 \u03b6\u03bb (1 + y\u03bb)\n\n+\n*\n*Z L\u0303\nY\nX\nY\n[(1 \u2212 d) + d\u03b4\u03bb,1 ]e\u03b2F\u03c4 \u03b6\u03bb (1 + xl \u03bb)(1 + y\u03bb)\nd\u03c1\u0302(xl )] log\n+\n[\nl=1\n\nc,\u03be\n\nc,\u03be\n\n+ \uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\nL=\n\nC\u0303=0\n\nL\nX\n\nL\u0303\n\n(38)\n\n\uf8fe\n\nP (L\u0303; L) L\u0303\n\n(39)\n\nL\u0303=0\n\nAverages denoted h* * *iC\u0303 and h* * *iL\u0303 are over the densities (6) and (7) with C\u0303 = 1, . . . , C and L\u0303 = 1, . . . , L.

This also implies that all densities involved in (32) \u03bb(x) =\n{\u03c0(x), . . . , \u03c8\u0302(x)} acquire the form \u03bb(x) = \u03b4[x \u2212 1] giving a free energy of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\nC\nC\nC\nlog 2 \u2212 \u03b2F\u03c4 h\u03b6i\u03b6\n\u2212\n(50)\nfF M =\nK\u2032\nK\nK\n\nThe physical meaning of the terms w\u22c6 \u03b4[x\u22121] in (44-47) is that the acquired microscopic knowledge gives a probabilistic\nweight at the ferromagnetic state. The state m = 0 is obtained if w\u03c3 = F\u03c3 = 0 and \u03c0\u0302(x) = \u03c6\u0302(x) = \u03b4[x] (paramagnetic\nsolution).\nV.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAMS\n\nIn this section we obtain numerical solutions for various attack scenarios. In all cases studied we assume an\nunbiased plaintext (p\u03c3 = 1/2, F\u03c3 = 0); for brevity we refer to the remaining bias parameter, the corruption level\ndenoted p\u03c4 in previous sections, simply as p. All experiments have been carried out using a regular cryptosystem with\nK = L = 2, being the original cryptosystem suggested in [4]. In principle, one can use any set of regular or irregular\nmatrices, provided one identifies the corresponding dynamical transition point. However, having been thoroughly\nstudied previously, the current construction serves as a particularly suited benchmark.\nSolving the coupled equations (40-47) we typically observe that for sufficiently small values of p the ferromagnetic\nstate m = 1 is the only stable solution whereas at a corruption value that marks the dynamical (spinodal) transition\nps , an exponential number of solutions with m 6= 1 are created (either suboptimal ferromagnetic or paramagnetic,\ndepending on the values of (K, C, L)). For all p > ps perfect decryption will be difficult to obtain. This transition\nalso defines the corruption level below which an unauthorized attacker, that have acquired partial information of the\nsecret keys, will be successful.\nWe will concentrate on two main attacks: (i) The attacker has partial knowledge of the keys (primarily the matrix\nB). (ii) The attacker has partial microscopic knowledge of the plaintext and/or corruption vector.\nIn figure 2 we present a phase diagram describing regions with perfect (m = 1) or partial/null (|m| < 1) decryption\nsuccess as evaluated from solving equations (32) and (48). We plot the dynamical transition corruption level ps as\na function of the private key fractional knowledge \u03b3 for different values of w\u03c3 and w\u03c4 (we have set p\u03c3 = 1/2 which\ncorresponds to an 'unbiased' plaintext). In the limit \u03b3 = 0 (i.e., no knowledge of the matrices), while m = 1 may be a\nstable solution, the decryption dynamics is fully dominated by |m| < 1 states. For \u03b3 = 1 the cryptosystem describes\na specific MN code and perfect decryption can occur below ps .\n\n\f9\n0.25\n0.2\n\nps\n\n|m| < 1\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\nm=1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03b3\nFIG. 2: Phase diagram of the spinodal corruption-rate against the fractional knowledge of the private key \u03b3 for a (K, C, L) =\n(2, 6, 2) cryptosystem for (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = (0, 0) (solid line) and (0.2, 0.2) (dashed line). Microscopic knowledge of the plaintext and\nthe corrupting vector enlarges the perfect decryption area, as expected.\n\nThe interaction between the sparsely (4) and densely (5) connected decryption components is non-linear and nontrivial; however, as a first approximation one can view the fractional matrix knowledge \u03b3 as changing the effective\nsparse component, which is the main contributor in the decryption process. To that end \u03b3 will have a direct impact\non the effective code rate N/(M \u03b3), the average connectivity \u03b3C and the connectivity distribution. It is clear that\nat an effective code rate 1 (\u03b3 = N/M = 1/3 in the case of the parameters used in figure 2) decryption is even not\ntheoretically feasible. The reason figure 2 points to a possibility of decryption below this value is due to additional\ninformation brought in by the dense components we ignored in this simplistic description.\nWe also examined the effect of prior microscopic knowledge of the plaintext/corrupting vector (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 > 0) on the\narea of perfect decryption; which clearly increases with the knowledge provided, as expected. Also this can be viewed\nas a change to the effective code rate. This time, the partial microscopic knowledge of either plaintext or corrupting\nvector (or both) serves to reduce the effective number of variables and hence the code rate itself; lower code rate will\ntypically allow for perfect decryption in worse corruption conditions as can be seen in figure 2\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n|m| < 1\n\n0.15\n\n|m| < 1\n\n0.15\n\nps\n\nps\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0.05\n\nm=1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\nm=1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03b3\n\nFIG. 3: Phase diagrams of the spinodal corruption-rates against the fractional knowledge of the private key \u03b3 for a (K, C, L) =\n(2, 6, 2) cryptosystem.

Smaller C-values correspond to higher rate codes and lead to smaller regions in parameter space where perfect\ndecryption is possible. Right: Overlap m as function of the corrupting-rate p obtained from equation (48) for a (K, C, L) =\n(2, 6, 2) cryptosystem and along the line \u03b3 = 0.8 for (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = (0.2, 0) (solid line) and (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = (0, 0) (dashed line).\n\nTo understand the implication of these results let us assume using the cryptosystem described in figure 2 at a\ncorruption level chosen of p = 0.1 (which is chosen much smaller that ps to increase the decryption reliability). In\nthis case knowing about 70% of the matrices (secret keys) will be sufficient for decrypting the ciphertext. True, there\nis still a need to know the dense matrix D\u22121 for extracting the plaintext itself and the exposed fraction of the secret\nkey is significant; but still there is a weakness that may be exploited by a skillful attacker.\nTo compare the importance of prior microscopic knowledge of plaintext versus that of the corrupting vector we\nplotted in figure 3 the phase diagram for (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = {(0.1, 0), (0.2, 0)} and (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = {(0, 0.1), (0, 0.2)} which describe\ntwo complementary scenarios (left and right figures respectively). The effect is quite similar, taking into account the\ninformation provided by the two vectors (the plaintext is unbiased but of length N while the corruption vector is\nbiased but of length M ). For high \u03b3-values microscopic knowledge of the corrupting vector becomes more informative\nthan that of the plaintext, an effect which becomes more emphasized as the fraction of known bits increases.\nIn figure 4 we compare two cryptosystems with (K, C, L) = (2, 4, 2) and (K, C, L) = (2, 3, 2) for (w\u03c3 , w\u03c4 ) = (0, 0).\nWe see that smaller C values (i.e., higher code rates) will reduce the area of perfect decryption. On the one hand,\nthis will increase the secret information required for perfect decryption at each corruption level; on the other hand it\nwill reduce the corruption level that can be used and will expose the cryptosystem to attacks based on an exhaustive\nsearch of corruption vectors.\nThe security of a cryptosystem may be compromised without a full recovery of the plaintext; also partial recovery of\nthe plaintext may pose a significant threat. To study the effect of partial knowledge of the matrices and plaintext on\nthe ability to obtain high overlap between the decrypted ciphertext and plaintext, we conducted several experiments,\nan example of which appears in figure 4. Here we show the overlap obtained m as function of the corruption-rate p\nfor a specific cryptosystem (K, C, L) = (2, 6, 2) along the line \u03b3 = 0.8 and for two different choices of w\u03c3 . Prior to\nthe dynamical transition points both ciphertexts are decrypted perfectly; this corresponds to corruption and partial\nknowledge levels below the solid and dashed lines of figure 2.\nAbove the dynamical transition point, new suboptimal solutions are created and the overlap value obtained deteriorates with the corruption level. However, the two different choices of w\u03c3 -values lead to two different deterioration\npatterns: while overlap in the system with no microscopic knowledge of the plaintext deteriorates very rapidly, the\nsystem with w\u03c3 = 0.2 provides solutions with high overlap values even if the corruption is high. As a consequence, we\nsee that the effect of microscopic knowledge goes beyond a shift in the dynamical transition point; it also influences\ndecryption beyond that point (in fact, it goes even beyond Shannon's limit).\nVI.\n\nBASIN OF ATTRACTION\n\nThe increasingly narrowing basin of attraction for the ferromagnetic solution, as the connectivity values K, C and\nL \u2192 \u221e, is central to the security level offered by the cryptosystem. The effect has been reported in a number of\npapers in the statistical physics [4, 12] and information-theory [5] literature; in this section we will show that the\n\n\f11\nbasin of attraction shrinks as the connectivity increases, to a value of O(1/K) as K, C \u2192 \u221e.\nTo provide a rough evaluation of the basin of attraction (BOA) for obtaining the ferromagnetic solution we focus on\nEq. (2) in the limit K, C \u2192 \u221e. BOA clearly depends on the algorithm used; here we focus on the Belief Propagation\n(BP) algorithm, which is empirically known to be the best practical algorithm for solving problems of the current\ntype. As far as we explored, no other schemes such as the naive mean field and the Belief Revision algorithms exhibit\nbetter performance than BP, which implies that our consideration on BP is at least of a certain practical significance\n(Survey Propagation [9] has not yet been tested for these systems).\nLet us represent prior knowledge on plain text \u03be and noise \u03b6 (in Ising spin representation) as the prior probabilities\nexp(F\u03c3i \u03c3i )\n,\n2 cosh(F\u03c3i )\nexp(F\u03c4 j \u03c4j )\n,\nPjo (\u03c4j ) =\n2 cosh(F\u03c4 j )\n\nPio (\u03c3i ) =\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nrespectively. Here, the parameters F\u03c3i and F\u03c4 j express confidence of the prior knowledge per variable, which is a\ngeneralization of the global prior terms F\u03c3 , F\u03c4 used earlier. Notice that this representation includes the case that\ncertain bits are completely determined by setting |F\u03c3i |(or |F\u03c4 j |) \u2192 \u221e, enabling us to cover various scenarios. In\nthe following, we assume that the fraction of completely determined bits is less than 1 when N, M \u2192 \u221e. Given\nprior probabilities (51) and (52), and the indicator function \u2206(\u03c3, \u03c4 ; \u03be, \u03b6, A) which is the alternative to parity check\nequation (2), the Bayesian framework provides the posterior probability\nQ\nQM\no\no\n\u2206(\u03c3, \u03c4 ; \u03be, \u03b6, A) N\ni=1 Pi (\u03c3i )\nj=1 Pj (\u03c4i )\npost\n,\n(53)\nP\n(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) =\nZ\nwhere Z is the normalization constant. Using Eq. (53), one can determine the best possible action for minimizing\nthe expected value of a given cost function [14]. As a cost function, we select here the Hamming distance between\nPN\nthe correct plain text \u03be and its estimates \u03be\u0302, L(\u03be\u0302, \u03be) = N \u2212 i=1 \u03be\u02c6i \u03bei ; this selection naturally offers the maximizer of\nposterior marginal (MPM) decoding \u03be\u02c6i = sign(m\u03c3i ) as the optimal estimation strategy, where\nX\nm\u03c3i =\n\u03c3i P post (\u03c3, \u03c4 ),\n(54)\n\u03c3 ,\u03c4\nis the average of spin \u03c3i over the posterior probability and sign(x) = 1 for x > 0 and \u22121, otherwise.\nComputational cost for an exact evaluation of the spin average (54) increases as O(2N +M ), which implies that\nMPM decoding is practically difficult. An alternative approach is to resort to an approximation such as BP.

Using m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci , the posterior average m\u03c3i is obtained as\nX\nath(m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci )).\n(57)\nm\u03c3i = tanh(F\u03c3i +\n\u03bc\u2208M\u03c3 (i)\n\nLet us investigate the condition necessary for finding the correct solution by iterating Eqs.(55) and (56) in the limit\nK, C \u2192 \u221e. For this purpose, we first employ the gauge transformation \u03bei m\u03c3\u03bci \u2192 m\u03c3\u03bci , \u03bei m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci \u2192 m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci , \u03b6j m\u03c4\u03bcj \u2192 m\u03c4\u03bcj ,\n\u0011\n\u0010Q\nQ\n\u03b6j m\u0302\u03c4\u03bcj \u2192 m\u0302\u03c4\u03bcj and J\u03bc\n\u2192 1.

Notice that any state which is\ncharacterized by decreasing absolute values |m\u03c3\u03bci | < 1 \u2212 \u03b5 and |m\u03c4\u03bci | < 1 \u2212 \u03b5 for an arbitrary fixed positive number\n\u03b5 > 0 is attracted to a locally stable solution m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci \u223c 0, m\u0302\u03c4\u03bcj \u223c 0, m\u03c3\u03bci = tanh(Fi\u03c3 \u03bei ) and m\u03c4\u03bcj = tanh(Fj\u03c4 \u03b6j ) for K \u2192 \u221e\nin a single update since products on the right hand sides of Eq. (58) vanish. To provide a rough evaluation of the\nBOA for the correct (ferromagnetic) solution m\u03c3\u03bci = 1 and m\u03c4\u03bcj = 1, let us assume that m\u03c3\u03bci and m\u03c4\u03bcj are randomly\ndistributed at 1 \u2212 \u03b5(K) and \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b5(K)) with probabilities 1 \u2212 p(K) and p(K), respectively, where \u03b5(K) and p(K)\nare small parameters to characterize the BOA for a large K. Under this assumption, m\u0302\u03c3\u03bci and m\u0302\u03c3\u03bcj are distributed at\n\u00b1(1 \u2212 \u03b5(K))K+L \u223c \u00b1(1 \u2212 \u03b5(K))K with probability (1 \u00b1 (1 \u2212 2p(K))K+L )/2 \u223c (1 \u00b1 (1 \u2212 2p(K))K )/2, respectively. If\neither (1 \u2212 \u03b5(K))K or (1 \u2212 2p(K))K is negligible, the absolute values of m\u03c3\u03bci and m\u03c4\u03bcj become sufficiently smaller than\n1, and therefore, the state is trapped in a locally stable solution in the second iteration [19]. This implies that the\ncritical condition is given by \u03b5(K) \u223c O(1/K) and p(K) \u223c O(1/K) for large K. In terms of the macroscopic overlap,\nthis means m0cr \u2248 1 \u2212 O(1/K).\nVII.\n\nRELIABILITY\n\nUnlike most of the commonly used cryptosystems which are based on a deterministic decryption procedure, the current cryptosystem relies on a probabilistic decryption process. The evaluation of decryption success for an authorized\nuser is therefore as important as assessing the level of robustness against attacks.\nIn practical scenarios, decryption success generally depends on the plaintext size. Analysis of finite size effects in\nthe belief propagation based decryption procedure is difficult. A principled alternative that we pursue here is based\non evaluating the average error exponent of the current cryptosystem; this provides the expected error-level at any\ngiven corruption level when maximum likelihood decoding is employed, and therefore represents a lower bound to the\nexpected error-rate. Moreover, the corruption levels employed are far below the critical (thermodynamic) transition\npoint, we therefore assume that belief propagation decryption will provide similar performance to maximum likelihood\ndecoding; clearly, the lower bound will become looser as we get close to the dynamical transition point.\nThe average block error rate PB (p) (i.e., erroneous decrypted plaintexts) takes the form\nPB (p) = e\u2212ME(p) ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere E(p) is the average error exponent per noise level p and M the length of the ciphertext (in the particular case\nof LDPC codes we assume that short loops, which contribute polynomially to the block error probability [17], have\nbeen removed). The quantity PB (p) represents the probability by which candidate solutions {\u03c3, \u03c4 } are drawn from\nthe set of those satisfying equation (4) (with \u03b3 = 1; authorized decryption) other than the ones corresponding to the\ntrue plaintext and corrupting vector, \u03c3 = \u03be and \u03c4 = \u03b6, respectively. To evaluate this probability we introduce the\nindicator function\nh\ni\nZ1\u03bb1 (\u0393; \u03b21 ) Z2\u03bb2 (\u0393; \u03b22 )\n\u03a8(\u0393) = lim lim\n(61)\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u03bb1,2 \u2192\u00b1\u03bb\n\n\u03b21 =\u03b22 =\u03b2\n\nwhere \u0393 = {\u03be, \u03b6, A} collectively denotes the set of quenched variables. The power \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] is used in conjunction\nwith the partition functions\nX X\nXX\nZ1 (\u0393; \u03b21 ) =\ne\u2212\u03b21 H(\u03c3 ,\u03c4 )\nZ2 (\u0393; \u03b22 ) =\ne\u2212\u03b22 H(\u03c3 ,\u03c4 )\n(62)\n\u03c3 \u03c4\n\u03c3 6=\u03be \u03c4 6=\u03b6\n\nto provide an indicator function as explained below. The Hamiltonian H(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) is given by (13) and the trace over spin\nvariables is restricted to those configurations satisfying equation (4). The above partition functions Z1 and Z2 differ\nonly in the exclusion of the true plaintext and corrupting vector in the trace over variables; this enables us to identify\ninstances where the maximum likelihood decoder chooses solutions that do not match\nPthe true (quenched variable)\n1 P\nvectors. The Hamiltonian (13) is proportional to the magnetizations m\u03c3 (\u03c3) = N1 i \u03c3i and m\u03c4 (\u03c4 ) = M\ni \u03c4i .\nTherefore, if the true plaintext and corrupting vectors have the highest magnetizations (decryption success), the\nBoltzmann factor exp[\u2212\u03b2H(\u03c3, \u03c4 )] will dominate the sum over states in Z2 in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e and \u03a8(\u0393) = 0.\nAlternatively, if some other vectors \u03c3 6= \u03be and \u03c4 6= \u03b6 have the highest magnetizations of all candidates (decoding\nfailure), its Boltzmann factor will dominate both Z1 and Z2 so that \u03a8(\u0393) = 1. Separate temperatures \u03b21,2 and powers\n\u03bb1,2 have been introduced to determine whether obtained solutions are physical or not (values of these parameters\nwill be obtained via the zero-entropy condition).\n\n\f13\n\n0.03\n\nE(p)\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\np\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nFIG. 5: Reliability exponent (63) as a function of the corruption level p for the case K = L = 2 and rates R = 1/2 (dashed\nline) and R = 1/4 (solid line).\n\nTo derive the average error exponent E(p) we take the logarithm of the above indicator function averaged with\nrespect to the disorder variables \u0393 = {\u03be, \u03b6, A}\n1\nlog h\u03a8(\u0393)i\u0393\nM\u2192\u221e M\n\nE(p) = lim\n\n(63)\n\nThe evaluation of (63) is similar in spirit to the analysis of section IV. For details of this calculation we refer the\nreader to [18] where we also study and compare the reliability and average error exponents of various low-density\nparity-check codes.\nResults describing E(p) for authorised decryption of the cryptosystem [4] are presented in figure 5 where we plot\nE(p) as function of the corruption level p for (K, C, L) = (2, 8, 2) (code-rate 1/4) and (K, C, L) = (2, 4, 2) (code-rate\n1/2) cryptosystems. It is clear that decryption errors decay very fast with the system size as we go away from the\ncritical corruption level. For instance, in the case of R = 1/4, using a corruption level of p = 0.13 (Shannon's limit is\nat p = 0.20) and a modest ciphertext size of M = 1000 will result in a negligible block error probability PB = 10\u221211 .\n\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have analyzed several security issues related to the recently suggested public-key cryptosystem of [4].\nThe suggested cryptosystem is based on the computational difficulty of decomposing a dense matrix into a combination\nof dense and sparse matrices (obeying certain statistics) which is a known hard computational problem. We have\nconsidered several attack scenarios in which unauthorized parties have acquired partial knowledge of one or more of\nthe private keys and/or microscopic knowledge of the plaintext and/or the 'corrupting vector'. The analysis follows\nstandard statistical mechanical methods of dealing with diluted spin systems within replica symmetric considerations.\nOf central importance to the unauthorized decryption is the dynamical transition which defines decryption success in\npractical situations. Our phase diagrams show the dynamical threshold as a function of the partial acquired knowledge\nof the private key; they describe regions with perfect- (m = 1) or partial/null decryption success (|m| < 1).\nPublic-key cryptosystems play an important role in modern communications. The increasing demand for secure\ntransmission of information has lead to the invention of novel cryptosystems in recent years. To this extent and\nbased on the insight gained by statistical physics analyses of error-correcting codes a new family of cryptosystems\nwas suggested in [4]. This paper constitutes a first step in studying this class of cryptosystems by considering the\npotential success of possible attacks.\nSeveral future research directions aimed at improving the security and reliability of this cryptosystem may include studying the efficacy of irregular code constructions and the use of novel decryption methods such as survey\npropagation [9] for pushing the dynamical transition point closer to the information theoretic limits.\n\n\f14\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Jort van Mourik for helpful discussions.
