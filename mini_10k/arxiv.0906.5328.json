So, one naturally has to revert to the\nseminal paper [19]. The fundamental idea of the works [13, 12, 16, 22], which can be considered as\nthe universal approach to (generalised) (S)LE, is based on the insight that SLE embeds naturally into\nthe picture of Virasoro uniformisation [3, 19, 21, 6].\nIn the various parts of this text we give the necessary background from the general theory, as indicated\nin the Bibliography section, and apply it to derive plenty of new connections with the Loewner equation.\nIn particular, we show that seemingly different classical approaches can be treated in a uniform manner\nat the analytical level by the theory of univalent functions.\nA comment concerning the style of writing. We have tried to give a readable account, first by seamlessly\ninterweaving proper results, mainly in the introductory sections, into the pre-existing mathematical\nfabric and then utilising it in the later parts to work out the new theory.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nUnivalent functions, the Grunsky matrix and Faber polynomials\nUnivalent functions and the Lie Group Aut(O)\n\nAn injective function f in a domain of the complex plane is called univalent (or schlicht). Further,\nan analytic and injective function is called a conformal mapping. The most important class of\nsuch functions is the set S of functions f which are analytic and injective in the unit disc D := {z \u2208\nC | |z| < 1}, normalised by the conditions f (0) = 0 and f 0 (0) = 1. Therefore every f \u2208 S has a power\n\n2\n\n\fseries expansion around the origin of the form:\nf (z) = z + a2 z 2 + a3 z 3 + * * * ,\n\n|z| < 1.\n\nThe most prominent example of a function of class S is the Koebe function\nk(z) = z(1 \u2212 z)\u22122 = z + 2z 2 + 3z 3 + * * * ,\nwhich maps the unit disc onto C \\ (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 14 ].\nA class related to S is the set of functions \u03a3, which are analytic and univalent in the domain D\u221e :=\n{z \u2208 C | |z| > 1} exterior to D and which have a simple pole at infinity with residue 1. Therefore for\nan element g \u2208 \u03a3, we have around \u221e the following series development\ng(z) = z + b0 + b1 z \u22121 + b2 z \u22122 + * * * .\nEvery such g maps D\u221e onto the complement of a compact connected set. If one properly adjusts the\nconstant term b0 then the range will not contain the origin 0. For each f \u2208 S, the map\nf 7\u2192 g(z) :=\n\n1\nf\n\n1\nz\n\n\u0001 = z \u2212 a2 + (a22 \u2212 a3 )z \u22121 + * * * ,\n\ncalled an inversion, establishes a bijection with the set \u03a30 of functions g, not mapping onto 0.\nMore generally, if we denote by O the complete topological C\u2013algebra C[[z]] of formal power series,\nand by Aut(O) the group of continuous automorphisms of O, then such a continuous automorphism\n\u03c1 is determined by its action on the generator z of C[[z]]. It may be represented by a formal power\nseries of theP\nform a1 z + a2 z 2 + * * * , with a1 6= 0. The unique maximal ideal m of O is then given by the\nn\nset zO = { \u221e\nn=1 an z }. Before we describe the structure of Aut(O) in more detail, let us introduce\nthe following spaces of formal power series.\n(\n)\n\u221e\nX\nf (z) =\nan z n ; a1 6= 0 ,\nAut(O) :=\nn=1\n\n(\nAut+ (O) :=\n\nf (z) = z +\n(\n\nAut0 (O) :=\n\nf (z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=2\n\u221e\nX\n\n)\nan z n\n\n,\n)\n\nan z\n\nn\n\n,\n\nn=3\n\nand their counterparts at infinity, i.e.\n(\nAut(O\u221e ) :=\n\ng(z) = bz +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n)\nbn z\n\n\u2212n\n\n; b 6= 0\n\n,\n\nn=0\n\n(\nAut+ (O\u221e ) :=\n\ng(z) = z +\n(\n\nAut0 (O\u221e ) :=\n\ng(z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\n)\nbn z \u2212n\n\n,\n)\n\nbn z \u2212n\n\n.\n\nn=1\n\nThese power series should be understood as the completions of the spaces of analytic functions which\nare locally univalent around either the origin or infinity. The completion is with respect to the natural\n3\n\n\ffiltration induced by the unique maximal ideal. So, these spaces are naturally seen to be Lie groups\nand we have the following Lie groups and Lie algebras:\nDer+ (O) = z 2 C[[z]]\u2202z\n\nAut+ (O)\n\u2229\n\n\u2229\n\nAut(O)\n\nDer0 (O) = zC[[z]]\u2202z\n\u2229\nDer(O) = C[[z]]\u2202z\n\nwhose properties are summarised in\nProposition 2.1 ([19]).\nC\u2217 and Aut+ (O).\n\n1. Aut(O) acts on itself by composition, and it is a semi-direct product of\n\n2. Aut(O)+ is a pro-algebraic group, i.e. Aut(O)+ = lim Aut+ (O/mn ).\n\u2190\u2212\n3. Lie(Aut(O)) = Der0 (O), Lie(Aut+ (O)) = Der+ (O), and the exponential map exp : Der+ (O) \u2192\nAut+ (O), is an isomorphism.\nWe have a natural embedding\nAut(O) ,\u2192 CN ,\n\n\u03c1 7\u2192 (a1 , a2 , . . . )\n\nand equivalently for the other Lie groups from above.\nIn particular, we see that Aut+ (O) has the structure of an affine space f0 + z 2 C[[z]] where f0 (z) \u2261 z.\nThe set {c1 , c2 , . . . }, where cn := an+1 , yields affine co-ordinates.\nNow, it follows from the Bieberbach-de Branges Theorem, that its affine coefficients cn , satisfy\n|cn | \u2264 n + 1\n\n\u2200n \u2265 1 ,\n\nso the set of schlicht functions S, can be identified with a subset of\nY\nBallC (0, n + 1) ,\nn\u22651\n\nand therefore is a (contractible) manifold. Let us note that the above condition is necessary but not\nsufficient for a function f to be in the class S.\nAnother suitable but more restrictive topology would be the usual Fr\u00e9chet topology on the vector\nspace of holomorphic functions.\nFinally, let us denote by M0 \u2282 Aut(O), the subset of analytic elements, i.e., whose power series\nconverges at least in a neighbourhood of 0; and correspondingly M\u221e \u2282 Aut(O\u221e ), and M stands for\nany of the two, which should follow from the context.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Grunsky matrix and Faber polynomials\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for a function defined on the unit disc to be univalent was given\nby Grunsky, via a system of inequalities, which are called the Grunsky inequalities.\n4\n\n\fWe shall now briefly recall the definitions of Faber polynomials and Grunsky coefficients [32, 10].\nLet us consider a complementary pair (f, g) of univalent functions which map onto non-overlapping\nregions of the Riemann sphere. This means that f (z) = a1 z + a2 z 2 + * * * , with r = |a1 | (and after a\nrotation we may assume a1 > 0), is analytic and univalent in |z| < 1, and\ng(w) = Rw + b0 + b1 w\u22121 + b2 w\u22122 + * * * ,\n\nR > 0,\n\nis analytic and univalent in |w| > 1. Further, suppose that f and g have disjoint ranges, i.e., f (z) 6=\ng(w) for |z| < 1 and |w| > 1.\nThen the following three matrices [cnm ], [dnm ] and [enm ] can be formed by the expansions\nf (z) \u2212 f (w)\nz\u2212w\n\n= \u2212\n\ng(z) \u2212 g(w)\nz\u2212w\n\n= \u2212\n\nf (z) \u2212 g(w)\nlog\nz\u2212w\n\n= \u2212\n\nlog\nlog\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\nm=0 n=0\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\nm=0 n=0\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\ncmn z m wn ,\n\n|z| < 1, |w| < 1;\n\ndmn z \u2212m w\u2212n ,\nemn z m w\u2212n ,\n\n(1)\n\n|z| > 1, |w| > 1;\n|z| < 1, |w| > 1.\n\nm=0 n=0\n\nOne observes that the matrices [cmn ] and [dmn ] are symmetric, i.e., cmn = cnm respectively dmn = dnm ,\nand that c00 = \u2212 log r, d00 = \u2212 log R and e00 = \u2212 log R, holds.\nDefinition 2.1. The matrices [cmn ], [dmn ] and [emn ], are called the Grunsky matrices and the\ncoefficients cmn , dmn and emn , the Grunsky coefficients.\nLet us unify the notation of the coefficients under the assumption that R = 1. Set b\u2212m,\u2212n := cmn for\nm, n \u2265 0 and bmn = dmn for m, n \u2265 1.\nThen for n \u2265 1 the Faber polynomials Gn (w) for general g, respectively Fn (w) for f with are defined\nby\ng(z) \u2212 w\nlog\nRz\n\n\u221e\nX\nGn (w) \u2212n\n= \u2212\nz ,\nn\n\nw \u2212 f (z)\nlog\nw\n\nf (z) X Fn (w) n\n= log\n\u2212\nz ,\nrz\nn\n\n(2)\n\nn=1\n\n\u221e\n\nn=1\n\nwhere Gn (w) is a polynomial of degree n in w and Fn (w) is a polynomial in 1/w of degree n. The Faber\npolynomials and the Grunsky coefficients can be related by the following identities (for R = r = 1):\nn\n\nGn (g(w)) = w + n\nFn (g(w)) = \u2212nb\u2212n,0 + n\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbnm w\n\n\u2212m\n\n,\n\nGn (f (w)) = nbn,0 + n\n\nm=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nbm,\u2212n w\u2212m ,\n\nFn (f (w)) = w\u2212n + n\n\nm=1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nb\u2212n,\u2212m wm .\n\nm=1\n\n5\n\nbn,\u2212m w\u2212m ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\f2.3\n\nDiff(S 1 )/S 1 and Kirillov's K\u00e4hler manifold of univalent functions\n\nThe dense subclass SK \u2282 S, consisting of univalent functions f which extend to a smooth injective\nfunction on the boundary \u2202D, and satisfy the additional condition f 0 (eit ) 6= 0, was first considered by\nA.A. Kirillov. The importance of SK comes from the following facts.\nLet us denote by Diff + (S 1 ), the infinite dimensional Lie group of C \u221e , orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle S 1 and, by abuse of notation, the subgroup of rotations Rot+ (S 1 ) also by S 1 .\nThis space has been extensively studied in the litterature, both in mathematics and physics [8, 20, 27,\n28, 29, 33] (and references therein). Then, as can be shown by conformal welding and a theorem of\nJ. Moser, there exists a canonical bijection [20]\nK : SK \u2192 Diff + (S 1 )/S 1 .\n\n(5)\n\nThis implies that SK is a homogenous space under the left action of Diff + (S 1 ), and that the identity\nfunction f0 (z) \u2261 z, is the stabiliser of the left action of S 1 .\nThe corresponding Lie algebra diff(S 1 ) can be identified with the C \u221e , real-valued left-invariant vector\nfields v(t)d/dt, with the Lie bracket given by\n[\u03c6, \u03c8] = \u03c6\u03c8\u0307 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307\u03c8,\n\n\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 diff(S 1 ) .\n\nThe Lie algebra diff(S 1 ), has a natural basis, with respect to the Fr\u00e9chet topology, consisting of\ntrigonometric polynomials\n\u03c6m (t) := cos(mt),\n\n\u03c8n (t) := sin(nt),\n\nm = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(6)\n\nLet us fix two parameters c, h \u2208 R. Then one can define a bilinear antisymmetric form on diff(S 1 ):\nZ 2\u03c0 \u0010\n\u0011\n1\nc\nc\n\u03c9c,h (v1 , v2 ) :=\n(2h \u2212 )v10 (t) \u2212 v1000 (t) v2 (t) dt .\n(7)\n2\u03c0 0\n12\n12\nLet us remark that the classical Gelfand-Fuks cocycle corresponds to \u03c91,0 . To have convergence\nin (7), the vector fields should be of Sobolev class 3/2, (cf. [1, 28, 35]).\nLet us now consider the complexification of the Lie algebra diff(S 1 ), namely\ndiff C (S 1 ) := diff(S 1 ) \u2297R C .\nIt has a topological basis {ek }k\u2208Z , given by\nek := \u2212ieikt\n\nd\n,\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nwhich satisfies the commutation relations of the Witt algebra, i.e.,\n[em , en ] = (n \u2212 m) em+n .\nNow, the complex Virasoro algebra VirC is spanned by the polynomial vector fields ek , and an additional element c. They satisfy the following commutation relations:\n[c, en ] = 0 ,\n[em , en ] = [em , en ] + \u03c9c,h (em , en ) * c ,\n6\n\n\fwhere \u03c9c,h , is the cocycle given by (7). In Physics the numbers c and h are usually called the central\ncharge resp. the highest weight.\nThen, on the set of vector fields with zero mean, i.e.\ndiff 0 (S 1 ) := {v \u2208 diff(S 1 ) |\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nv(t)dt = 0}\n0\n\none can introduce a complex structure. Namely, the Schwarz kernel defines a familiar integral operator\nI, called the Hilbert transform, on L2 (S 1 ) by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nt\u2212\u03c6\n(If )(t) := pv.\ncot\nf (\u03c6) d\u03c6 .\n(9)\n\u03c0\n2\n0\nAs the integral diverges, it has to be regularised by taking its principal value\n\u0012Z t\u2212\u000f Z 2\u03c0 \u0013\n1\nIf (t) := lim\n.\n+\n\u03c0 \u000f\u21920 0\nt+\u000f\nA calculation shows that\n\n\uf8f1\nint\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ie\nI(eint ) = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2212ieint\n\nn > 0,\nn = 0,\nn < 0,\n\nwhich yields I 2 = \u2212 id. Further, the operator I can be extended by continuity to a bounded operator\non the entire space. Therefore, the Hilbert transform defines a canonical almost-complex structure J,\non diff 0 (S 1 ), which can be equivalently written as:\nJ(v(t)) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212ak sin(kt) + bk cos(kt)) .\n\n(10)\n\nk=1\n\nLet us note, that the extended complex structure on the complexified tangent space allows us to go\nfrom tangent vector fields to normal vector fields on the circle.\nIf we denote by T Aut+ (O) the real tangent space, i.e. the vector space of real first order differential\noperators on Aut+ (O), then the above complex structure J on Aut+ (O) induces the splitting\nT Aut+ (O) \u2297R C = T (1,0) Aut+ (O) \u2295 T (0,1) Aut+ (O) .\nNow, by the Kirillov identification one can define a two-parameter family of K\u00e4hler metrics on S0 , by\nputting wc,h := \u03c9c,h (*, J(*)). At the origin f0 \u2261 z, in the affine co-ordinates {ck }, it has the form [20]\nwc,h :=\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\n2hk +\n\nk=1\n\n\u0011\nc 3\n(k \u2212 k) dck \u2227 dc\u0304k .\n12\n\n(11)\n\nThis metrics also generate the Weil-Petersson metric.\nLet us conclude this section by summarising the various analytic subspaces of the space of formal\npower series and their additional structures:\nKirillov\n\ndense\n\nDiff + (S 1 )/S 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Aut+ (O) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Aut(O) .\nbijection\n\n7\n\n\f3\n\nSubordination chains and the Neretin-Segal semi-group\n\nLet us start with the following important (cf. Fig 1),\nDefinition 3.1. A family of conformal maps ft : D \u2192 C is called a subordination chain if the\nfollowing conditions hold:\n\u2022 \u2200s, t \u2208 R+ and s \u2264 t : fs (D) \u2282 ft (D)\n\u2022 \u2200t : ft (0) = 0 and ft0 (0) = et\n\u2022 f0 \u2261 f\nWe have to remark, that one could use instead of 0 another base point for the family of domains and\nsecond, instead of increasing domains one could have a family of strictly decreasing domains with the\nderivative at the origin being ft0 (0) = e\u2212t . In particular this is the standard parametrisation for the\nradial Loewner equation in the unit disc.\nGiven a subordination chain of domains defined for t \u2208 [0, T ), with T \u2208 R+ \u222a {\u221e}, by a theorem of\nCh. Pommerenke [32], there exists a regular analytic function on D,\np(z, t) = 1 + p1 (t)z + p2 (t)z 2 + * * * ,\n\n(12)\n\nsuch that <(p(z, t)) > 0, i.e. maps the unit disc onto the right half-plane, and satisfies the partial\ndifferential equation, called the Loewner-Kufarev equation\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n(z, t) = z *\n(z, t) * p(z, t) ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\n(13)\n\nfor z \u2208 D and for almost all t \u2208 [0, T ).\nThe function wt : D \u2192 D, wt := ft\u22121 \u25e6 f0 is called the transition function of the subordination chain,\nand satisfies\nlim et wt = f0 , and w0 \u2261 idD .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nIf we assume that the maps ft are smooth and injective up to the boundary, wt (S 1 ) gives a family of\nJordan curves surrounding the origin. Hence, the transition functions can be seen as elements of the\nz = f (\u03be, t) = et * \u03be + . . .\nS1\n\nD(t)\nD\n0\n\n1\n\nD(s)\n\n0\n\nD(s) \u2282 D(t) for s < t\n\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of a subordination chain.\nNeretin-Segal semigroup [29, 33] which has different but equivalent realisations. In our context\nthe following will do. The Neretin semi-group is the set of analytic maps \u03c1 : S 1 \u2192 D such that\n8\n\n\f1. \u03c10 (ei\u03b8 ) 6= 0,\n2. \u03c1(S 1 ) is a smooth Jordan curve, parametrised counter-clockwise.\nThe tangent cone ner to the Neretin semigroup at the identity is the collection of inward-pointing\nvector fields on the unit circle. ner is an open convex Diff + (S 1 )-invariant cone in the Lie algebra\nVectC (S 1 ). Therefore, the Neretin semi-group can be considered as a \"substitute\" for the non-existing\ncomplex Virasoro group (cf. [29, 33]).\n\n4\n\nBoundary Variations and the Witt algebra\n\nIn this section we shall first recall a derivation of the Loewner equation as done in [12], based on the\nvariational method of M.A. Lawrentjew und B.W. Schabat [26].\nLet us be given a Jordan curve C that bounds a domain D = D(C). Further we assume that the\nmap fC which maps D(C) onto the unit disc D, such that for an interior point z0 \u2208 D(C), it satisfies\nfC (z0 ) = 0 and fC0 (z0 ) > 0, is known.\ne is a \"nearby\" Jordan curve that also encircles the point z0 , we seek to know the function\nSo, if C\ne bounded by C,\ne again onto D and satisfies f e (z0 ) = 0, f 0 (z0 ) > 0.\nfCe that maps the domain D(C)\ne\nC\nC\nThis problem can be solved in the following way. Let z1 \u2208 C be the point that is mapped by fC onto\n.\n\n\u03b4(s)\nJordan curve\nC\n\nz1\nf(z,C)\n\nz0\n\n0\n\n~\n\nf(z,C)\n\n~\nC\n\nUnit disc\n\n.\n\nFigure 2: Schematic representation of a boundary variation of a Jordan domain with the corresponding\nvariation of the mapping function.\n1 \u2208 S 1 \u2261 \u2202D, and let s denote the arc length parmeter of C, measured from z1 in the positive sense.\nThen s ranges over the interval [0, l], where l denotes the length of C, as the point \u03b6 traces over C in\nthe positive sense. Since we know fC , we also know the dependence of the points w = ei\u03b8 on the arc\nlength s:\nZ s\nd\u03b8\n|fC0 (\u03b6(s))|ds.\n(14)\n= |fC0 (\u03b6(s))|,\n\u03b8(s) =\nds\n0\ne shall differ only slightly from C which means that if \u03b4(s) denotes the length of the segment\nThe curve C\ne (cf. Fig. 2) then (we assume that C is sufficiently\nof the normal of C at the point s between C and C\nsmooth)\n|\u03b4(s)| < \u03b5, |\u03b4 0 (s)| < \u03b5, |\u03b4 00 (s)| < \u03b5,\n9\n\n\fwhere \u03b5 is a fixed and sufficiently small real number. Further we shall adopt the convention that\n\u03b4(s) > 0 if the segment is contained in D(C), and \u03b4(s) < 0 if it is outside of D(C). Under fC the\ne is mapped onto a curve C\ne \u2217 that differs only by little from S 1 and this new curve satisfies in\ncurve C\ni\u03b8\npolar coordinates \u03c1e , up to an error term of higher order, the following approximate relation\nd\u03b8\n\u03b4(s) =: 1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2217 (s)\nds\n\n\u03c1 \u2248 1 \u2212 |fC0 (\u03b6(s))| * \u03b4(s) = 1 \u2212\n\nwhere s = s(\u03b8) is now a function of \u03b8, as it can be obtained from Eq. (14).\ne onto the unit disc is given by\nThen, as explained in [26], the uniformising map of the domain D(C)\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ 2\u03c0 i\u03b8\n1\ne + fC (z) \u2217\nfCe (z) = fC (z) 1 +\n\u03b4 (\u03b8) d\u03b8 + O(\u03b52 ) .\n(15)\n2\u03c0 0 ei\u03b8 \u2212 fC (z)\nNow, if choose an arbitrary continuous family of Jordan curves which interpolates between the initial\ncurve C = C0 and a final curve Ctf , such that the sequence of corresponding domains D(Ct ) forms a\ndecreasing subordination chain, then we can derive a differential equation for the family of uniformising\nmaps fCt .\nLet us denote the difference in the normal direction of two nearby curves Ct1 and Ct2 with t1 \u2264 t2 as\n\u03b4(t1 , t2 , st1 ), where st1 is the arc length parameter on Ct1 . Then the corresponding quantity \u03b4 \u2217 (t1 , t2 , \u03b8)\nis always positive, since the normal directions are always inward pointing, which follows from our\nassumption on how the contours grow.\nIt follows from Eq. (15), that to calculate the difference quotient\nfCt2 \u2212 fCt1\nt2 \u2212 t1\nand then the differential, we have to consider the following expression\nlim\n\nt2 \u2192t1\n\n\u03b4 \u2217 (t1 , t2 , \u03b8)\n=: \u03bdt1 (\u03b8)\nt2 \u2212 t1\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we assume, that this limit exists. Basically, (16) is telling us, that we can differentiate under\nthe integral in (15), and \u03bdt (\u03b8) is the derivative of \u03c1(t1 , \u03b8), i.e. of the radial change. The quantity\n\u03bdt1 (\u03b8)d\u03b8\nis therefore a Borel measure on the unit circle and the differential equation for a continuous deformation\nwith \"densities\" \u03bdt (\u03b8) is hence\n1\n\u2202fCt (z)\n= fCt (z) *\n\u2202t\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nei\u03b8 + fCt (z)\n\u03bdt (\u03b8) d\u03b8 .\nei\u03b8 \u2212 fCt (z)\n\n(17)\n\nLet us also give the version for the inverse function ft := fC\u22121\n, which describes the evolution of the\nt\nfamily of maps from D onto D(Ct ). Then equation (17) becomes,\n\u2202ft\n1\n(z) = \u2212zf 0 (z) *\n\u2202t\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nei\u03b8 + z\n* \u03bdt (\u03b8) d\u03b8 .\nei\u03b8 \u2212 z\n\n(18)\n\n\fLet us first note that the integral in equation (18) is exactly the Herglotz representation of the\nLoewner-Kufarev transition function p(t, z) (cf. eq. (12)). Second, if one takes for \u03bdt (\u03b8) a timedepended Dirac measure on the unit circle, i.e., \u03b4x(t) with |x(t)| = 1, then for eiu(t) \u2261 x(t), one\nobtains\n\u2202ft\neiu(t) + z\n(z) = \u2212zf 0 (z) * iu(t)\n,\n(19)\n\u2202t\ne\n\u2212z\nwhich is usually called the radial Loewner equation.\n\n4.1\n\nLie vector fields and Witt generators\n\nHere we shall derive the infinitesimal action of a boundary variation on the space Aut(O), (cf. [12]).\nFurther we shall give an explicit representation of the positive part of the Witt algebra in terms of\nthe Lie vector fields, written in the affine co-ordinates on SK . The expressions we shall obtain are\nidentical to those obtained by A.A. Kirillov and D. Yur'ev [20], using another variational formula,\nnamely the one by G.M. Goluzin and M. Schiffer. Besides boundary variations there are also the\ninterior variations, which come from meromorphic functions. However, one can relate the two for\nsmooth enough boundaries.\nLet v be a real 2\u03c0-periodic function which can be written as a Fourier series:\nv(t) = a0 + a1 cos(t) + b1 sin(t) + a2 cos(2t) + b2 sin(2t) + * * * .\nWe shall use the following relations for n \u2265 1:\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\neit + z\ncos(nt) it\ndt = z n and\n2\u03c0 0\ne \u2212z\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nsin(nt)\n0\n\neit + z\ndt = \u2212iz n .\neit \u2212 z\n\nTherefore, we have according to expression (18) the following natural action of a boundary variation:\nto the normal vector field v(eit )n on S 1 corresponds the Lie field, (which at the identity is an element\nof Der0 (O)):\nZ 2\u03c0 it\n1\ne +z\n0\n(Lv (f ))(z) = \u2212zf (z)\nv(t) dt .\n(20)\n2\u03c0 0 eit \u2212 z\nLet vk (t) := \u2212ieikt . Then we have\nProposition 4.1. The nonnegative part of the Witt basis acts in terms of Lie vector fields as\nLk := Lk f (z) = z 1+k f 0 (z).\nIf f \u2208 S \u2282 Aut+ (O), then in the infinite affine co-ordinate system {cn }, the following representation\nholds\n\u221e\nX\nLk = \u2202k +\n(n + 1)cn \u2202n+k ,\nk\u22651.\n(21)\nn=1\n\nLet us remark that the constant vector field v0 \u2261 \u2212i * 1, which induces dilatations, leads out of the\nclass S. Also, a similar co-ordinate representation exists for the group Aut(O).\nFrom equation (20), and the Loewner-Kufarev equation (13), we see that the time derivatives of the\nuniformisation maps of a subordination chain are given by the Lie fields induced by the normal vector\nfields governing the infinitesimal deformation of the boundaries of the domains.\n11\n\n\fLet us give a different representation of eq. (19). Namely, by expanding the Schwarz kernel into its\nTaylor series,\n\u221e\nX\neit + z\n=\n1\n+\n2\ne\u2212int z n ,\neit \u2212 z\nn=1\n\nwe obtain:\nProposition 4.2. The radial Loewner equation can be written in terms of the Lie vector fields as\n\u221e\n\nX\n\u2202ft\n(z) = L0 f (z) + 2\ne\u2212inu(t) Ln f (z) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(22)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere exp(iu(t)), is the pre-image of the tip of the slit, at time t.\nSo what is the role of meromorphic vector fields? They correspond to interior variations and can be\ntranslated into boundary variations, where the normal shift is given by projecting the difference vector\nonto the normal direction, i.e.,\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\u03c12\n1\n.\n\u03b4n(s) = <\nit0 (s) t(s) \u2212 z0\nWe see, that from the point of view of boundary variations only the positive Fourier modes play a\nrole.\n\n5\n\nSchramm-Loewner Evolutions\n\nThe inverse problem related to a sub-ordination chain is called the Loewner-Kufarev problem.\nNamely, given an initial domain and a driving function p(z, t), when does the solution represent a\nsubordination chain of simply connected domains. O. Schramm [36] posed the problem with Brownian motion as the driving function, and with the claim that the complement of the so-evolving domains\nwith respect to the unit disc should describe in principle the conformaly invariant scaling limit of various two-dimensional lattice models. The analytic part of this inverse problem was solved by him\ntogether with S. Rohde [34].\nThe idea of O. Schramm was to describe the (probability) measure on the path space by looking at\nan observable, which is defined as the position of the tip of the appropriately parametrised random\ncurve, after uniformisation of the complement of the arc with respect to the disc. His claim was, that\nthe statistics describing the position of such points should be Gaussian, centred at the starting point\non the boundary of the co-domain, with the variance as the only free parameter. This was based on\nthe following assumptions:\n\u2022 the random driving function Ut should be a continuous process,\n\u2022 the distribution of Ut \u2212 Us , is a function only of t \u2212 s, i.e., the increments are identically\ndistributed,\n\u2022 Ut \u2212 Us , is independent of Ur , 0 \u2264 r \u2264 s, i.e. it has a Markovian property.\n\n12\n\n\f\u221a\nThis would imply, that Ut = \u03bct + \u03baBt , for a standard Brownian motion Bt . In case that the\ndistribution of the image of the tip after uniformisation is symmetric about the starting point, then\nthis yields \u03bc = 0, i.e. the process is driftless.\nThe chordal SLE\u03ba curve \u03b3 in the upper half-plane H describes the growth of simple random curves\nemerging from the origin and aiming at infinity, as follows:\nDefinition 5.1 (Schramm-Loewner Equation). For z \u2208 H, t \u2265 0 define gt (z) by g0 (z) = z and\n\u2202gt (z)\n2\n.\n=\n\u2202t\ngt (z) \u2212 Wt\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\nThe maps gt are normalised such that gt (z) = z + o(1) when z \u2192 \u221e and Wt := \u03ba Bt where Bt (\u03c9)\nis the standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, starting at 0 and with variance \u03ba > 0. Given the\ninitial point g0 (z) = z, the ordinary differential equation (23) is well defined until a random time \u03c4z\nwhen the right-hand side in (23) has a pole. There are two sets of points that are of interest, namely\nthe preimage of infinity \u03c4 \u22121 (\u221e) and its complement. For those in the complement we define:\nKt := {z \u2208 H : \u03c4 (z) < t}\n\n(24)\n\nThe family (Kt )t\u22650 , called hulls, is an increasing family of compact sets in H where gt is the uniformising\nmap from H \\ Kt onto H. Further there exists a continuous process (\u03b3t )t\u22650 with values in H such that\nH \\ Kt is the unbounded connected component of H \\ \u03b3[0, t] with probability one. This process is the\ntrace of the SLE\u03ba and it can be recovered from gt , and therefore from Wt , by\n\u03b3t =\n\nlim\n\nz\u2192Wt ,z\u2208H\n\ngt\u22121 (z) .\n\n(25)\n\nThe constant \u03ba characterises the nature of the resulting curves. For 0 < \u03ba \u2264 4, SLE\u03ba traces over\nsimple curves, for 4 < \u03ba < 8 self-touching curves (curves with double points, but without crossing its\npast) and, finally, if 8 \u2264 \u03ba the trace becomes space filling.\nNow, for another simply connected domain D with two boundary points A, B \u2208 \u2202D the chordal SLE\u03ba\nin D from A to B is defined as\nKt (DA,B ) := h\u22121 (Kt (H, 0, \u221e))\nwhere Kt (H, 0, \u221e) is the hull as in (24) and h is the conformal map from D onto H with h(A) = 0\nand h(B) = \u221e. It is very important to note that this definition is justified because of the assumed\nconformal invariance of the measures.\nLet us rewrite (23) in It\u00f4 form, by setting ft (z) := gt (z) \u2212 Wt , which now satisfies the stochastic\ndifferential equation\n2\ndft (z) =\ndt \u2212 dWt .\n(26)\nft (z)\nFor a non-singular boundary point x \u2208 R, we can read off the generator \u00c2 for the It\u00f4-diffusion\nXt := ft (x) as\n1 d\n\u03ba d2\n\u00c2 = 2\n+\n.\nx dx 2 dx2\nDefining the first order differential operators\n`n := \u2212xn+1\n\nd\ndx\n13\n\nn\u2208Z,\n\n(27)\n\n\fwe obtain\n\n\u03ba 2\n` \u2212 2`\u22122 .\n2 \u22121\nLet us note, that the differential operators (27) form a representation of the Witt algebra.\n\u00c2 =\n\n6\n\nThe Universal Grassmannian and Determinant Line Bundles\n\nWe are going to recall briefly the definition of the Segal-Wilson Grassmannian of a Hilbert space [33].\nThis is a functional analytic realisation of M. Sato's \"Universal Grassmannian Manifold\" (UGM) (cf.\ne.g. [19]).\nLet H be an infinite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space and let\nH = H+ \u2295 H\u2212\nbe an orthogonal decomposition into closed infinite dimensional subspaces H+ and H\u2212 . Then GrSW (H) \u2261\nGr(H), is the set of closed subspaces W \u2282 H satisfying\n1. the orthogonal projection pr+ : W \u2192 H+ is a Fredholm operator,\n2. the orthogonal projection pr\u2212 : W \u2192 H\u2212 is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.\nGrSW (H) is a Hilbert manifold, modelled on the Hilbert space J2 (H+ , H\u2212 ), of all Hilbert-Schmidt\noperators from H+ to H\u2212 . A general element of the group of restricted automorphisms GL\u221e (H), has\nthe block matrix form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA B\nA : H+ \u2192 H+ , B : H\u2212 \u2192 H+ ,\nwhere\nC D\nC : H+ \u2192 H\u2212 , D : H\u2212 \u2192 H\u2212 ,\nwith B, C being Hilbert-Schmidt and A, D Fredholm operators.\nIn our case the Hilbert\nis given by H := L2 (S 1 , C). Let H+ be the subspace\nconsisting of\nP\nP space ikt\nfunctions of the form k\u22640 dk e , and H\u2212 the subspace of functions of the form k>0 ck eikt . In fact\nH\u2212 \u222a {1}, can be identified with the Hardy space H 2 (D). More generally, we could take as the Hilbert\nspace, all formal Laurent series around the origin, and split them into their regular and principal\n(singular) parts.\nA related possibility would be to consider only those functions on S 1 which have zero mean, or\nequivalently all exact 1-forms. In the language of Laurent series this gives a splitting into the principal\npart and the regular part without the constant term. This approach leads to the infinite, generalised\nSiegel disc, and permits to give a generalisation of the classical period mapping [20, 28, 29].\n\n6.1\n\nYur'ev-Krichever embedding into the infinite Siegel disc and the UGM\n\nIt was shown by D. Yur'ev [20], that the Grunsky matrix provides an embedding (period mapping) of\nM \u2282 Aut(O), into the universal Grassmannian.\nLet us take the complexified Sobolev space H := HC := H \u22121/2 (S 1 , C)/C, consisting of (generalised)\nfunctions with zero mean, and let us define a symplectic form on HC :\nI\n1\n\u03c9(f, g) :=\nf dg .\n2\u03c0 S 1\n14\n\n\fWith respect to the above bilinear, alternating form, the Hilbert space HC has a canonical decomposition into two closed isotropic subspaces, as already previously introduced.\nThe infinite Siegel disc D\u221e consists of operators Z \u2208 M (H\u2212 , H+ ), which are symmetric and HilbertSchmidt, i.e., they satisfy\n>\nZ > = Z,\nand 1 \u2212 Z Z > 0 .\n(28)\nThe K\u00e4hler potential on D\u221e can therefore be defined as: \u2212 tr log(1 \u2212 Z \u2217 Z).\nLet f \u2208 M \u2282 Aut(O). Then one can holomorphically associate to f the subspace Wf \u2208 Gr(H),\nexpressed in terms of the Faber polynomials Fn , or equivalently, with the Grunsky matrix (b\u2212n,\u2212m ),\nas the space spanned by 1, and all vectors of the form:\nwn (z) := Fn (f (z)) = z\n\n\u2212n\n\n+n\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nb(f )\u2212n,\u2212m z m\n\nn\u22651.\n\n(29)\n\nm=1\n\nIn the literature [3], a seemingly different mapping was used, but which in fact reduces in the analytic\ncase to the embedding via the Grunsky matrix. Let H, H+ and H\u2212 , be as already introduced.\nThen one can associate to a given function f (z, w), which is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of (0, 0),\nthe linear operator Tf , defined by\nTf : H+ \u2192 H\u2212 ,\nh(z\n\n\u22121\n\n(30)\n\n) 7\u2192 Resw=0 f (z, w)h(w\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0001\n\n) .\n\nAnalogously, given a function g(z \u22121 , w\u22121 ), holomorphic on (\u0108\\{0}\u00d7 \u0108\\{0}) and vanishing at (\u221e, \u221e),\none can associate the operator\nTg : H\u2212 \u2192 H+ ,\n\n(31)\n\nh(z) 7\u2192 Resw=0 g(z\n\n\u22121\n\n,w\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0001\n)h(w) .\n\nSimilar constructions apply for the diagonal entries of the 2 \u00d7 2 block matrix (as just previously\nintroduced). Then these operators are continuous and the space M (H+ , H\u2212 ), consists of operators of\nthe form Tf , with the analogous statement for M (H\u2212 , H1 ) and Tg , (cf. [3] and the reference in there).\nBut, this gives an equivalent description to (29), as one can see by applying the definition of the\noperator to meromorphic functions of the form z n , n \u2208 Z.\n\n6.2\n\nRegularised Determinants and Determinant Lines\n\nIn String Theory but also in Conformal Field Theory, the partition function is considered to be\na section of a determinant line bundle. Here we shall briefly recall how one can define them in\ndifferent ways. The necessity to use the partition function comes from the fact, that it is the canonical\nobservable for a domain on which one intends to derive a conformally invariant family of measures\non simple paths. Physically, this may involve an underlying lattice model with appropriate boundary\nconditions. Mathematically, it translates into a tensor product of the bulk contribution(s) with the\nboundary contribution(s), which are forms of a specific weight. This is the basic idea behind the\napproach to SLE and its generalisations, as originally introduced in [5, 16, 13, 22, 23].\nLet us start by explaining, how one can associate to a univalent map on the unit disc a determinant\nrespectively a determinant line. There are at least five relevant ways of doing so. More details\nconcerning this section can be found in [14, 30, 33, 3, 37].\n15\n\n\fTo every Jordan domain D, we can associate the determinant of the Laplacian \u2206 (with respect to a\nfixed reference metric, e.g., the Euclidean metric, and with Dirichlet boundary conditions), i.e.,\nY\n0\n\u03bbn := e\u2212\u03b6 (0) .\ndet(\u2206D ) := det(\u2206gEucl. ) :=\neigenvalues\n\nSo we get a trivial line bundle over M \u2282 Aut(O), by associating to a point f , the value of the\ndeterminant det(\u2206f ), in the corresponding domain Df := f (D), i.e.,\ndet(\u2206f )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c0y\nM \u2282 Aut(O)\nThe uniformising map provides us also with a natural connection which allows us to compare the\nregularised determinants at different points. It has its origin in Polyakov's string theory [31]. Let us\nconsider the space F, of all flat metrics on D which are conformal to the Euclidean metric, obtained\nby pull-back. Namely, for a Jordan domain D, let f : D \u2192 D be a conformal equivalence, and define\n\u03c6 := log |f 0 | .\nThis gives a correspondence of harmonic functions on the unit disc with the category of simply connected domains, and by Weyl rescaling, with F itself, via\nds = |f 0 ||dz| = e\u03c6 |dz| .\nTo fix the SU(1, 1)-freedom, which gives classes of isometric metrics, we have to work with equivalence\nclasses. So, e.g. 0 corresponds to the orbit of the Euclidean metric under SU(1, 1).\nThe connection is given by the Polyakov-Alvarez formula (cf. e.g. [30]):\n1\n\ndet(\u2206f ) = e\u2212 6\u03c0\n\nH\n\n1\nS 1 ( 2 \u03c6\u2217d\u03c6+\u03c6|dz|)\n\n* det(\u2206D ) .\n\n(32)\n\nThen the partition functions of the corresponding domains (for a two-dimensional target space and\nwithout the boundary contributions) are related by:\n1\n\nZf = e 6\u03c0\n\nH\n\n1\nS 1 ( 2 \u03c6\u2217d\u03c6+\u03c6|dz|)\n\n* ZD .\n\n(33)\n\nIt is a classical fact (cf. e.g. [7, 19, 37] and references therein), that the infinitesimal variation, induced\nby a vector field v, on a Riemann surface, of a determinant, det, coming from the Green's function, is\nrelated to the Schwarzian derivative:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf 000 (z) 3 f 00 (z) 2\n\u2212\n.\n(34)\nS(f, z) := {f ; z} := 0\nf (z)\n2 f 0 (z)\nIn Physics, the variation of log(det), is then said to be given by the \"expectation value of the energymomentum tensor\", i.e.,\n1\n\u03b4 log(det) =\nhT (v)i ,\n(35)\n2\u03c0i\nwhich, as is well known, has the transformation properties of a projective connection. Let us note,\nthat this transformation property is at the origin of the so-called \"restriction martingale\" from SLE,\nwhich was found in [25], and then explained in [16].\n16\n\n\fThe determinant line bundle over the infinite Grassmannian is a holomorphic line bundle Det. The\nfibre Det(W ) at W \u2208 Gr(H), can be seen to be the \"top exterior power\" of W , and which can be\nconstructed as follows [33, 22]: for a so-called admissible basis w = {wk } of W and \u03bb \u2208 C it is the\nformal semi-infinite wedge product\n\u03bbw\u2212d \u2227 w\u2212d+1 \u2227\u2212d+2 \u2227 * * * .\nIf we change the basis w 7\u2192 w0 with w = tw0 , then \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bb det(t). The union of all such one-dimensional\ncomplex vector spaces Det(W ) for W \u2208 Gr(H), is the line bundle DetGr . Differently, for W let\nDet(W ) :=\n\nmax\n^\n\nker(pr+ |W )\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n\u2297\n\nmax\n^\n\ncoker(pr+ |W ) .\n\n(36)\n\nThe sections of Det\u2217 , the dual of the determinant line bundle, constitute the free Fermionic Fock\nspace, \u0393(Det\u2217 ).\nLet us summarise the various relations between the spaces of univalent functions and the infinite\nGrassmannian in the following diagram:\ndet(\u2206f )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nup to a\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nfactor\n\nDet\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\ndense\nYur'ev\nDiff + (S 1 )/S 1 \u223c\n= S0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S \u2282 Aut+ (O) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Gr(H)\nKrichever\n\n7\n\nVirasoro modules\n\nWe are going to recall two representations of the Virasoro algebra. The first one could be called\n\"universal\" in our context, and the second one, is a particular realisation of it. Namely, it gives the\n\"universal deformation of the complex disc\".\n\n7.1\n\nVirasoro action on the Universal Grassmannian\n\nThe complex vector fields (8), {en }n\u2208Z , on the circle, which satisfy the commutation relations of the\nWitt algebra, have a representation (20) in terms of the Lie fields Len , and as we know act transitively\non Aut(O), i.e., the Lie algebra homomorphism\n{en } \u2192 {Len } = Vect (Aut(O))\nhas the property that for every f \u2208 Aut(O) the evaluation map\n\u03c1f : {en }n\u2208Z \u2192 Tf Aut(O) ' Der0 (O),\nis surjective.\nAnalogously, there exists a representation of the {en } in terms of infinite matrices for the Grassmannian [21, 33].\nNamely, the Lie algebra of the Lie group GL\u221e , is gl\u221e . It is contained in the bigger Lie algebra a\u221e ,\nwhich can be described as the infinite matrices, with a finite number of nonzero diagonals. This algebra\nhas a projective representation, and its central extension \u00e2\u221e := a\u221e \u2295 Cc, has a linear representation.\n17\n\n\fThe two-cocycle on a\u221e , is given for two elements a1 , a2 , by tr(c1 * b2 \u2212 c2 * b1 ), where the bi , cj are the\ncorresponding block matrices in the decomposition of the ak .\nc \u221e , is the central extension of GL\u221e . It acts on the determinant line bundle Det, and it\nThe group GL\ncovers the transitive action of GL\u221e .\nFinally, the orbit of the Bosonic vacuum, 1, under the action of GL\u221e , is an infinite-dimensional\nmanifold. Its description is given by Hirota's bilinear equation. This space contains, as we shall see,\nthe traces of SLE. So, the connection with the \u03c4 -function and Integrable Systems, is immediate.\nLet us summarise all this:\nc\u221e\nVirC \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u00e2\u221e \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 GL\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ncentral\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\na\u221e\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nDet\n\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nexp\n\ntransitive\n\nWitt \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 gl\u221e \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 GL\u221e \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Gr(H)\n\n7.2\n\nThe Kirillov-Yur'ev-Neretin representation of the Virasoro algebra\n\nKirillov-Yur'ev and Neretin gave an explicit description of the action [20, 29] in terms of the infiniteaffine co-ordinates (cf. also [14, 13])\nOn the infinite complex manifold Aut+ (O) there exists an analytic line bundle Ec,h which carries\na transitive action of the Virasoro algebra. The line bundle Ec,h is in fact trivial, with total space\nEc,h = Aut+ (O) \u00d7 C. We can parametrise it by pairs (f, \u03bb), where f is a univalent function and \u03bb \u2208 C.\nIt carries the following action defined by Y. Neretin [29],\nLv+\u03c4 c (f, \u03bb) = (Lv f, \u03bb * \u03a8(f, v + \u03c4 c)) ,\nwhere\nI \u0014\n\u03a8c,h (f, v + \u03c4 c) := h\n\nwf 0 (w)\nf (w)\n\n\u00152\n\ndw\nc\nv(w)\n+\nw\n12\n\nI\n\nw2 S(f, w)\n\n(37)\ndw\n+ i\u03c4 c ,\nw\n\n(38)\n\nand with S(f, w) denoting the Schwarzian derivative (34), of f . The central element c acts fibrewise linearly by multiplication with ic. The appearance of the Schwarzian is not so surprising if one\nremembers the infinitesimal variation of the regularised determinant. However, in [20], this term was\nnot present.\nOne can endow the space of holomorphic sections |si \u2208 O(Ec,h ) \u2261 \u0393(Aut+ (O), Ec,h ) of the line bundle\nEc,h with a VirC -module structure.\nNamely, let P be the set of (co-ordinate dependent) polynomials on M, defined by\nP (c1 , . . . , cN ) : Aut(O)/mN +1 \u2192 C ,\nwith m the unique maximal ideal. In the classical literature on complex variables the above quotient\nspace is called the coefficient body. P corresponds to the sections O(M) of the structure sheaf\nOM of M, and it carries an action of the representation of the Witt algebra in terms of the Lie fields\nLn \u2261 Len .\n18\n\n\fNow, O(Ec,h ) can be identified with the polynomial sections of the structure sheaf, i.e. with O(M),\nby choice of a free generator, and the previous trivialisation.\nThe action of VirC on sections of Ec,h can then be written in co-ordinates, with the notation \u2202n \u2261\naccording to formulae (37, 38) as (cf.

The singular vector for the\ncorresponding (irreducible) Verma module Vc,h with respect to {L\u2212n }, n \u2265 1, is again the constant\npolynomial 1.\nWe have summarised the geometry and the various actions in the following commutative diagram of\nshort exact sequences\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 VirC \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Witt \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\ny\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u0398Ec,h \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u0398M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\ny\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Ec,h \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0\nwhere \u0398X denotes the respective tangent sheaf.\n19\n\n\f8\n\nThe SLE path space\n\nLet us relate now the general theory, as developed in the previous sections, to SLE.\n\n8.1\n\nThe SLE path space on the Grassmannian\n\nLet us consider the set W0,S 1 (D), of all Jordan arcs on the closed unit disc D, such that one endpoint\nis the origin 0, the other endpoint is on the boundary S 1 , and all other points are in the interior, D.\nIf we fix a parametrisation \u03b3(t), of such an arc, starting at the boundary, i.e., \u03b3(0) \u2208 S 1 , then we can\nobtain a family of \"standard\" normalised univalent maps gt , such that the arc up to time t, \u03b3[0, t],\nsatisfies \u03b3[0, t] = D \\ gt (D).

Then\nwe have\nProposition 8.1. Up to reparametrisation, the set W0,S 1 (D), maps injectively (and continuously)\ninto the space of simple paths in M \u2282 Aut(O), starting at the identity z. Equally, it can be mapped\none-to-one into the space of simple paths in the Grassmannian Gr(H), starting at H+ .\nInjectivity follows from the fact that the traces are compact subsets of the domain, which is a Hausdorff\nspace. If two traces, with the exception of the endpoints are different, there are at least two interior\npoints of the curves which are different. Hence, we can choose open disjoint neighbourhoods, around\nthese two points. The family of mappings for one of the curves at some instance maps the point onto\nthe boundary, for the other never. Then, it follows from the Open Mapping theorem and the Identity\ntheorem for analytic functions that the corresponding traces in M, must have points which are not\nthe same, which in turns shows injectivity.\n\n8.2\n\nHypo-Ellipticity and sub-Riemannian Geometry\n\nThe SLE equation (26) can be expanded into a Laurent series around infinity.

Therefore, the resulting flow is hypo-elliptic [22, 13], and the corresponding geometry subRiemannian.\nLet us note, that the above discussion clearly links SLE with \"Rough Path Theory\" (cf. [15]).\n\n9\n\nStatistical Mechanics and Virasoro action on measures\n\nIn the previous sections we have seen that the conformally invariant measures on simple paths are\ncharacterised by the diffusion constant \u03ba.\nGiven a simply connected planar domain D, conformally equivalent to the unit disc, and two distinct\nboundary points A and B, then one can consider W = W(DA,B ), the set of Jordan arcs in D,\nconnecting A with B. A particular trace \u03b3 \u2208 W, corresponds then to an elementary event. However,\nthe \u03c3-algebra FDA,B , we are going to use, contains also all Jordan arcs, starting either at A or B,\nwithout connecting the other marked boundary point. However, the set of all these events will have\nmeasure zero, i.e. the measure is supported on W.\nThe set {\u03bcDA,B } of all measures on the traces, forms a convex cone. The subset of all probability\nmeasures PDA,B , called the state space, is a convex set, i.e. with \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 also any convex combination\n21\n\n\f\u03bc = \u03b11 \u03bc1 + \u03b12 \u03bc2 , \u03b11,2 \u2265 0 and \u03b11 + \u03b12 = 1 is a (mixed) state. The points in the closure of the state\nspace are the Dirac measures \u03b4\u03b3 .\nIf we assume that on our domain a lattice model from statistical mechanics is defined, then the\nthermodynamical equilibrium at the absolute temperature T > 0 is described by the Gibbs state\nd\u03bcG (\u03c3) :=\n\n1 \u2212\u03b2E[\u03c3]\ne\n,\nZ\n\n\u03b2 :=\n\n1\nT\n\n(inverse temperature)\n\nwhere the numerical pre-factor Z > 0, gives the normalisation, such that the sum of all elementary\nevents ads up to 1. It is defined as\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2E[\u03c3] ,\nZ :=\n{\u03c3}\n\nwhere E[\u03c3] is the energy of the configuration \u03c3. Z is the (discrete) partition function. By choice of\nappropriate boundary conditions (bc), every configuration compatible with the bc, creates an element\nin W. The Gibbs measure corresponds then, at the discrete level, to the canonical state, and in the\ncontinuum, it is given by the exponential of a Lagrangian density.\ncone of measures\n\n\u03bc1\nsection of conformally\ninvariant measures\n\n\u03bc2\nf\u2217\n\n\u03c0\n\nf\nD1\n\nmanifold of domains\n\nD2\n\nFigure 3: The fibre bundle of measures over the manifold of (slit) Jordan domains.\n\nIf we focus on the measures which can be obtained as the continuum limit of lattice curves, then the\nfollowing two properties are found to be natural to hold for these measures:\nMarkovian property If \u03b3 is a random Jordan arc, and \u03b3 0 \u2282 \u03b3 a sub-arc, with A as common starting\npoint, and with A0 as endpoint, then the conditional distribution of \u03b3 given \u03b3 0 is\n\u03bcDA,B |\u03b3 0 = \u03bc(D\\\u03b3 0 )A0 ,B .\n\n(42)\n\nNote, that this property is expected to be true for the scaling limit of several models, even off the\ncritical point.\nThe second property is the so-called \"conformal invariance\", which, however, should be valid only at\nthe critical point. It was conjectured and investigated by M. Aizenman, R. Langlands, P. Pouilot,\nY. Saint-Aubin [2, 24], and then established by O. Schramm [36], for the loop-erased random walk\nand the uniform spanning tree.\n\n22\n\n\fConformal invariance (ALPS-functor) Let f : D \u2192 D0 , be a conformal equivalence, so that\nthe boundary points (A, B) of D are mapped onto the points (A0 , B 0 ) on the boundary of D0 ,\npreserving the order. Then the image measure f\u2217 \u03bcDA,B is the same as \u03bcD0 0 0 , the measure\nA ,B\n\nwhich is indigenously obtained as the continuum limit of lattice curves from A0 to B 0 in D0 .\nThe above categorical statement can be represented by the following commutative diagram\nf\n\n0\nDA,B \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 DA\n0\n0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6,B\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nFALPS y\nFALPS y\nf\u2217\n\n\u03bcDA,B \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03bcD0 0\n\nA ,B 0\n\nThe category JDom\u2022,\u2022 of (generalised) Jordan domains with two marked and ordered boundary points,\ncan be parametrised by an infinite manifold. Namely, if we consider first the set J\u221e of smooth Jordan\ncurves, then one has the double quotient [1]\nSU(1, 1)\\ Diff + (S 1 )/SU(1, 1)\nas the base space, and as fibre model of the total space, the torus (minus the diagonal), i.e., S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \\\n{diagonal}. The sections correspond then to domains with two distinct, marked boundary points.\nAs conformally invariant measures are translational invariant, it is enough to look at J\u221e\n0 , i.e., all\nsmooth Jordan curves surrounding the origin. But we already know, that this set is a submanifold of\nAut(O), which also contains slit Jordan domains. Therefore we have\n\u03c0\n\n{measures on Jordan arcs} \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 (S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \\ {diagonal}) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M ,\u2192 Aut(O) .\nThen the trivial bundle, with fibre (almost) a torus, parametrises, up to one real positive constant\n\u03ba, conformally invariant probability measures on simple paths, which connect two distinct boundary\npoints.\nInstead of the above bundle of measures on Jordan arcs, we have also to regard line bundles Zc,h ,\nwhich represent the partition function of a model from statistical mechanics, defined on domains with\ngiven boundary conditions. The situation is similar to the already introduced bundles Ec,h .\n\n9.1\n\nDeformations of conformal measures and the partition function valued martingale\n\nWe have introduced the bundle of measures, with convex sets as fibres. A subset of this space, namely\nthe conformally invariant measures on bordered domains, obtained from lattice models in the scaling\nlimit at criticality, depend on two parameters (c, h) \u2208 R2 , (cf. [14]).\nNow, to make the link between the SLE description and the Conformal Field Theory descritpion, we\nshall deform the state by conditioning it on an appropriately growing sub-arc, (cf. Fig. 4). By the\nMarkovian type property this is the same as considering a family of randomly evolving slit domains.\nLet us fix our reference domain DA,B , and a conformally invariant measure \u03bcD \u2261 \u03bcDA,B . This measure\ndefines a state |hi \u2208 PDA,B . Consider a random Jordan arc \u03b3([0, t]), which by abuse of notation we\nshall denote \u03b3t , connecting the boundary point A = \u03b3(0) with the interior point A0 = \u03b3(t) \u2208 D.\n23\n\n\fdeformed states R(ft )|h!\n\npath of conditioned\nmeasures \u03bcD |\u03b3t\n\nconformally invariant\nmeasure \u03bcDA,B = |h!\n\nGibbs measure\n\n|0!\n\nset of probability measures (state space)\n\nFigure 4: The convex set of probability measures PDA,B , on a fixed domain DA,B . The Gibbs state\n|0i, the conformally invariant state \u03bcDA,B =: |hi, and a Virasoro deformed state R(ft )|hi, which is\nequal to the conditional measure \u03bcD |\u03b3t .\n\nFurther, let {\u03b3t }, be the measurable set of traces \u03b3 0 , which contain \u03b3t as a sub-arc, i.e. \u03b3t \u2282 \u03b3 0 . Then,\nthe conditional probability\n\u03bcD (\u2022 \u2229 {\u03b3t })\n\u03bcD |\u03b3t (\u2022) :=\n,\n\u03bcD ({\u03b3t })\ngives a new measure on the same underlying measurable space. But, at is was shown in [16], the ratio\nof the partition function Z\u03b3t := ZD\\\u03b3t , of the slit domain and of the original domain ZD , \"corresponds\nto the volume of paths containing the arc \u03b3t \". Therefore,\n\u03bcD ({\u03b3t }) =\nand hence\n\u03bcD |\u03b3t (\u2022) =\n\nZ\u03b3t\n\u2264 1,\nZD\n\nZD\n*\u03bcD (\u2022 \u2229 {\u03b3t }).\nZ\u03b3t\n|{z}\n\n=:M\u03b3t\n\nLet f\u03b3t : D \\ \u03b3t \u2192 D, be a conformal equivalence. Then by the Markovian property and the conformal\ninvariance of the measure, we have\n\u03bcD |\u03b3t = \u03bcD\\\u03b3t = f\u03b3\u2217t \u03bcD .\nNote that f\u03b3\u2217t \u03bcD = (f\u03b3\u22121\n)\u2217 \u03bcD , i.e., the pull-back measure is given by the inverse function f\u03b3\u22121\n:D\u2192\nt\nt\nD \\ \u03b3t \u2282 D.\nLet us recall that the elementary events are the random arcs \u03b3. So, for the Radon-Nikodym derivative\nwe obtain,\nd\u03bcD |\u03b3t\nZD\n= M\u03b3t =\n.\n(43)\nd\u03bcD\nZ\u03b3t\nAnalogously to the reasoning which led to the derivation of the nature of the driving function of SLE,\nwe can conclude that M\u03b3t \u2261 M (\u03b3, t) = Mt (\u03b3), has to be a (local) martingale on the path space, if it\ncomes from a conformally invariant measure on paths.\nSo, what we have gained is, that equation (43) and the martingale property give the explicit relation\nbetween SLE and CFT, as we will show.\n24\n\n\fLet us summarise the content of the fundamental equation (43):\nTheorem 9.1. The operation of conditioning on a sub-arc, gives a deformation of a conformally\ninvariant measure, on a fixed measurable space, supported by Jordan arcs, as obtained from Statistical\nMechanics models. The deformation space is a subset of the absolutely continuous measures, with\nrespect to the undisturbed measure, where the Radon-Nikodym derivative is given by the inverse ratio\nof the partition functions of the underlying domains.\nAs next we are going to describe in detail the structure of the martingales M\u03b3t , and to show that the\ndeformations are generated by the Virasoro algebra.\nThe physical partition function Z, is mathematically, a tensor product of forms of weight c and h, i.e.,\nZ = Zc,h = Zc \u2297 Zh , defined as sections of a line bundle. Namely, we have\nTheorem 9.2 (FKK 2003; [16, 22, 13, 23]). Let a configuration DA,B , consisting of a simply connected\ndomain D, with metric g smooth up to the boundary and two marked boundary points A, B, with\nanalytic local co-ordinates, be given. For (c, h) \u2208 R2 , the partition function Zc,h (D) of chordal SLE\u03ba\nis:\nZc,h (D) = |detD |\u2297c \u2297 |TA\u2217 \u2202D|\u2297h \u2297 |TB\u2217 \u2202D|\u2297h = det(\u2206D )\u2212c * Zh (\u2202D) ,\nwhere Zh (\u2202D) is the boundary contribution, c the central charge, and h the highest-weight. (The\nconnection between c, h, \u03ba shall be revealed later!)\nSo, the structure of the above tensor product is composed of the contribution from the bulk, which\nis expressed by the regularised determinant of weight c, and a contribution from a form of weight\nh, restricted to the boundary of the domain. The latter is motivated by the notion of \"boundary\ncondition changing operators\". In our framework, these operators can be seen as deforming the Gibbs\nstate into a new measure, that has a specific transformation property under conformal maps. These\noperators act like a multiplication of the integrand with a characteristic function, when calculating\nthe Gibbs sum, respectively the Functional Integral. The particularity is, that these operators can be\nparametrised by geometrical data, namely the \"location of the insertion on the boundary\".\nTherefore, the density M\u03b3t depends on the above two parameters c and h, i.e., M\u03b3t = Mc,h (\u03b3, t).\nFor a moment let us focus on M\u0303\u03b3t , coming from the regularised determinant part of M\u03b3t . By eq. (33)\nand the semi-group property for regularised determinants (cf. [14]), we have for the part without the\nboundary contribution,\nH\nc\n1\nZc (t) = Z\u0303\u03b3t = e 6\u03c0 S1 ( 2 \u03c6\u03b3t \u2217d\u03c6\u03b3t +\u03c6\u03b3t |dz|) Z\u0303D\n(44)\n\u2202 \u22121\nwhere, gt := f\u03b3\u22121\n: D \u2192 D \\ \u03b3t , is a biholomorphic map, and \u03c6\u03b3t := log | \u2202z\nf\u03b3t |. Now, because of the\nt\nsemi-group property, the determinant can be written as an exponential of infinitesimal conformal maps.\nWe have already seen in (35), that the infinitesimal variation of a regularised determinant is given\nby the Schwarzian derivative. This has been axiomatised in CFT, as the canonical transformation\nproperty of the energy-momentum tensor.\n\nAt this point, let us briefly recall the following facts from the general theory of vertex operator\nalgebras (cf. [11]).\nA (local) conformal transformation \u03c1, induces an endomorphism R(\u03c1), of the CFT Hilbert space. This\ncorresponds to a representation of the Lie group Aut(O), on the Hilbert space, by exponentiating\nthe non-negative part of the Virasoro algebra Vir\u22650 . The operator insertions of primary fields O,\n\n25\n\n\ftransform homogeneously, whereas the stress-energy operator T , changes in-homogeneously, i.e.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011hi\nY\u0010\n,\n(45)\nO(yi ) = R(\u03c1)O \u03c1(yi ) R(\u03c1)\u22121\n\u03c10 (yi )\ni\n\n\u0011\nc\nT (z) = R(\u03c1)T \u03c1(z) R(\u03c1)\u22121 + S\u03c1(z) 1 ,\n12\n\u0010\n\n(46)\n\nwhere S\u03c1 is the Schwarzian derivative of \u03c1 (cf. eq. (34)), and the prime 0 denotes differentiation with\nrespect to the variable z.\nNow for DA,B , let g\u03b3t : D \u2192 D\\\u03b3t , be a conformal equivalence such that g\u03b3t (A) = \u03b3(t) and g\u03b3t (B) = B.\nThen following [16], we find for (43):\nM\u03b3t \u2261 Mc,h (\u03b3, t) =\n\n|g\u03b30 t (A)|h |g\u03b30 t (B)|h\n\n\u0012\n\nc\n* R exp \u2212\n6\n\nZ\n0\n\nt\n\n\u0013\nSg \u03b3s (A) ds ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere R denotes that the exponential expression has to be suitably regularised. In particular, if\nin Thm. 6.5. in [25], the hull A, is defined as A := {\u03b3t \u2212 \u000f} \u222a {\u03b3t + \u000f}, and the limit \u000f \u2192 0, is properly\ntaken, then one recognises (47) for t \u2192 \u221e, as the Radon-Nikodym derivative, of that situation.\nBut we already know, as we work with conformally invariant measures on paths, that the projection of the process in the total space onto the base, has to correspond to some SLE\u03ba in the path\nspace (cf. Fig. 5). This implies, that the family of uniformising maps g\u03b3t , is a solution of the related\n\u221a\ninverse Loewner chain, and the driving function Ut has to be \u03baBt for some \u03ba.\nA direct calculation, applying It\u00f4's formula, as for the \"restriction martingale\" in [25], gives the\nnecessary condition for the expression (47) to be a martingale:\nTheorem 9.3. Given a pair (c, h) \u2208 R2 , and \u03ba > 0, then the density Mc,h (\u03b3, t) is a martingale, iff\nthe following relations hold:\nc=\n\n(6 \u2212 \u03ba)(3\u03ba \u2212 8)\n2\u03ba\n\nand\n\nh=\n\n6\u2212\u03ba\n.\n2\u03ba\n\n(48)\n\nInstead of projecting the partition function valued martingale Mt down, we could equally well lift\nthe SLE process ft (\u03b3) up to Zc,h . But then, as we know, the sections s : M \u2192 Zc,h , of the twisted\ndeterminant line bundle, have to be such that the resulting process\nZc,h (t, \u03b3) := s \u25e6 ft (\u03b3) ,\n\n(49)\n\nis a martingale.\nAs we previously discussed, and because the bundle Zc,h is trivial, the space of sections \u0393(M, Zc,h ) \u2261\nO(M), is given by polynomial functions, once a trivialisation has been chosen, and which are dense\nin the space of all (real)-analytic sections. Therefore, if the (an ) are the co-ordinates in M, the\nexpression (49) can be written as (a polynomial approximation)\nZc,h (t, \u03b3) = spolyn. (a1 (t, \u03b3), a2 (t, \u03b3), . . . , aN (t, \u03b3), . . . ) ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere the notation an (t, \u03b3) expresses the fact that the coefficients are random variables, i.e. they\ndepend on the curve \u03b3 and time t, and with spolyn. a polynomial section (function).\nThe density M\u03b3t can be written as the ratio of the constant section sD \u2261 ZD and a section s\u03b3 , such\nthat Z\u03b3t \u2208 im(s\u03b3 ), for all t \u2265 0.\n26\n\n\fNow, let us consider what conditions the sections have to satisfy in order that the lifted process is a\nmartingale.\nTherefore, let us apply It\u00f4's formula, in our chosen trivialisation, to (49). Then, we find:\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u03ba\ndZc,h (t) = \u2212dWt (L\u03021 s)(ft ) + dt ( L\u030221 + 2L\u03022 )s (ft )\n2\nwhere\nL\u03021 :=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202b0\n\nand\n\nL\u03022 :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\npk (b)\n\nk=1\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202bk\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nIt is important to note, that although the above differential operators L\u03021 and L\u03022 , look the same\nas in (41), they are part of the Virasoro algebra with non-trivial central charge, and of the dual\nrepresentation. Their explicit form is analogous to (39), but the representation is taken around infinity.\nProposition 9.4 (FKK [16, 22], BB [4]; 2003). The lift of an SLE-process, s \u25e6 ft , is a martingale, if\nthe section s, is in the kernel of the second-order differential operator \u00c2\u221e := \u03ba2 L\u030221 + 2L\u03022 , corresponding\nto an element from the universal enveloping algebra, in the dual representation.\nAs we know from Section 7.2, (cf. [20]), the Virasoro algebra acts in form of differential operators on\nthe space of sections. It can be endowed with a (graded) Virasoro module structure. Similar to the\nBosonic Fock space representation of the Virasoro algebra, acting on the constant section 1, generates\na highest-weight module Wc,h of weight (c, h). The dual module, is the irreducible Verma module Vc,h .\nIt has been shown [4], that\nker \u00c2\u221e = Wc,h .\nAs next we would like to define an operator, acting on our probability space. Fix a domain DA,B ,\nand let f : D0 \u2192 D be a (FD0 0 0 , FDA,B )-measurable map. Define the action of the operator R(f ) by\nA ,B\npush-forward, i.e.\nR(f )\u03bcDA,B := f\u2217 \u03bcD0 0 0 .\nA ,B\n\nNow, let D0 \u2282 D, such that D \\ D0 is simply connected and D \u2229 {D0 is compact. Then, any homeomorphism fD0 : D0 \u2192 D can be considered as a partially defined function on D itself. Nevertheless,\nwe can consider\nf 0 \u2217 \u03bcD\nD\n\nOur definition of the sigma algebra is such that this partially defined function is still measurable.\nIf \u03bcD =: |hi, then the measure \u03bcD |\u03b3t is given by R\u03b3t |hi, where R\u03b3t := R(f\u03b3 )t . The Radon-Nikodym\nderivative can be written as:\n\u03bcD |\u03b3t\nhh|R\u03b3t hi :=\n= Mt (\u03b3)\n\u03bcD\nUnder a conformal automorphism \u03c1 \u2208 Aut+ (O), which fixes two boundary points, and is without\ndilatation, we have for a conformally invariant probability measure |hi:\nhh|R(\u03c1)hi \u2261 1\nFor a differentiable one-parameter family of biholomorphic maps ft , t \u2265 0, such that\nft : D \u2192 ft (D) =: Dt ,\n27\n\n\fand f0 \u2261 idD , we have\n\nd\ndt\n\nt=0\n\nhh|R(ft\u22121 )hi \u2261 0 .\n\nTherefore the constant density 1 can be seen as the ground state, which is annihilated by all Ln , n \u2265 1.\nThis expresses the fact of conformal invariance of the measure.\nSo we have\nProposition 9.5 (Virasoro action on measures). The deformation space of conformally invariant\nmeasures on simple paths, arising from conditioning on a subarc, is given by a highest-weight representation of the Virasoro algebra in terms of differential operators, acting on polynomial densities.\nLet us summarise what we have just gained. The SLE observable is the location of the tip on the\nboundary, after uniformisation. The physical observable is the partition function Zt . The latter\nobservable is defined as the value of the partition function of the slit domain, i.e., the boundary is\nenlarged by the segment \u03b3t . Both observables are random variables, as they depend on the particular\nrealisation. SLE depends on \u03ba, the physical observable Zt is characterised (in the simplest case) by\n\nB\n\nA\n\nFigure 5: Canonical commutative diagram: \"SLE = commutativity\".\ntwo real variables c and h. Therefore, the relation between conformally invariant measures on simple\npaths, derived from Statistical Mechanics, and SLE is given by the commutativity of the Diagram 5.\nFinally, the construction as a whole, can be seen, in principle, as a version of Geometric Quantisation.\nOn the base we have a transitive action of the Witt algebra, and on the total space, i.e., the twisted\ndeterminant line bundle, of the Virasoro algebra. In the representation as differential operators,\nfactorisation requires the sections to be harmonic with respect to the lifted generator. This means\nthat the partition function martingale is the Doob transform of the SLE process, or in the language\nof representation theory, is given by a degenerate highest-weight representation at level two.\n\n10\n\nOutlook\n\nWe have seen the general framework which is underlying SLE. Further, we have given a rigourous link\nbetween conformally invariant measures, derived from CFT, with SLE.\nThe canonical commutative diagram 5, which permits to couple the physical observable with the\nmathematical observable, is the key to generalisations, e.g. massive perturbations.\n\n28\n\n\fOur demonstration for the special case, the disc, extends to the general situation, namely to arbitrary\nbordered Riemann surfaces. The necessary parts of that construction are gathered in the following\ndiagram (for one marked point, and without denoting boundary components) (cf. [13, 16, 22, 23])\ntrans.\n\nVirC \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 det\u2297c,h\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ntrans.\n\nWitt \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nM\u0302g,1\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nDet\u2297c,h\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nKrichever\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Gr(H)\n\nMg,1\nwhere Mg,1 is the moduli stack of smooth pointed curves of genus g > 1, and M\u0302g,1 is the moduli\nstack of triples (X, p, z), where (X, p) \u2208 Mg,1 , and z is a formal co-ordinate at p. Then, M\u0302g,1 is\nan Aut(O)\u2013bundle over Mg,1 . The determinant line bundle \u03c0 \u2217 det\u2297c,h is the pull-back of a tensor\npower of the corresponding determinant line bundle. Notably, the above can be applied, with some\nmodifications, to Kac-Moody algebras (cf. [11]).\nAlso, the right object to obtain conformally invariant measures on loops on arbitrary Riemann surfaces,\nis again the Grassmannian of Sato-Segal-Wilson, combined with the line bundle on the loop space,\ncoming from a sheaf of groupoids over the surface with connective structure.\nFinally, the connection with Integrable Systems should be now quite clear (cf. [15]).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author gratefully thanks the organisers of the MSJ-Seasonal Institute, held 2008 in Kyoto, for\ntheir hospitality and support.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Airault, P.
