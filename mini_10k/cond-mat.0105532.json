The\nphenomenon is characterized by a 1/f \u03b1 decay with a nontrivial \u03b1 \u2248 1 found in the power spectrum S(f ) of a given\ntime signal at low frequencies f . It has been observed in\na huge number of diverse systems, many of which are far\nfrom equilibrium and show an avalanche-like dynamics.\nExamples include earthquakes [1,2], combustion fronts\n[3], chemical reactions [4], flux motion in superconductors [5], and Barkhausen noise [6], to name only a few.\nIn the search for a general dynamical mechanism for\n1/f \u03b1 noise in far from equilibrium systems, Bak, Tang\nand Wiesenfeld (BTW) proposed the concept of selforganized criticality (SOC) [7,8]. This refers to the tendency of spatially extended, slowly driven systems to\norganize into a state with fractal spatial and temporal\nproperties that is also characterized by self-similar distributions of event (avalanche) sizes. Although the original \"sandpile\" model, which was introduced to exemplify the SOC concept, exhibits a scale-free distribution\nof avalanches, its noise spectrum is of the form 1/f 2 [9].\nVariants of the original sandpile model do indeed exhibit nontrivial 1/f \u03b1 noise, but in these cases [10] the\navalanche event distributions are not critical, implying,\npossibly, mutual exclusivity between a SOC mechanism\nand mechanisms giving long range temporal correlations\nsuch as 1/f \u03b1 noise.\nIn fact, it has recently been argued in the context of\nsolar flares, transport dynamics in magnetic confinement\ndevices, and other areas, that the presence of temporal correlations between events excludes SOC as an underlying mechanism. For instance, in Ref. [11] it was\nstated that for SOC \"one expects no correlation between\n... bursts\". See Ref. [12] for a discussion and references.\nThe argument entails a narrowing of SOC to the phenomenology of certain, specific \"sandpile\" models, which\nis in sharp contrast to the original idea [7,8], and is erroneous as we show here.\nIn order to demonstrate explicitly that SOC can provide a dynamical mechanism which gives correlations between bursts leading to 1/f \u03b1 noise, we study a slowly\n\ndriven, deterministic \"sandpile\" model. It exhibits a\npower-law distribution of avalanches, as well as 1/f \u03b1\nfluctuations in the pattern of dissipation over the slow\ntemporal domain of the external drive. Despite the fact\nthat the time scales of the driving and of the avalanche\nevents are completely separated, the critical behavior of\nthe power spectrum is solely determined by the critical\nproperties of the avalanche size distribution. In addition,\nthe results we find are robust with respect to changes in\nthe definition of the time scale associated with the driving. These observations constitute a proof that a SOC\nmechanism can give low frequency 1/f \u03b1 noise due to\ncorrelations between power-law distributed avalanches,\nwithout imposing temporal correlations in the external\ndrive.\nActually several different models of SOC, describing\ne.g. traffic [13] and evolution [8,14] do exhibit nontrivial 1/f \u03b1 noise over the temporal domain of individual\navalanches. In this context, it is important to distinguish\nbetween temporal correlations within the time span of\nindividual avalanche events, and low frequency noise observed over a much longer temporal regime of an arbitrarily slow external drive. Measured in this external time\nscale, the individual avalanches can occur almost instantaneously. This is a situation often encountered in Nature. In this case 1/f \u03b1 noise must arise from correlations\nbetween avalanches. These correlations can either be induced by long range temporal correlations in the external\ndrive, or be an intrinsic part of the self-organization process itself. Sanchez et al have found long range temporal\ncorrelations in SOC when the \"sandpile\" is driven by an\nexternal source of low frequency noise [12].\nHowever, it is important to clarify if SOC itself can spontaneously generate both critical avalanche\nstatistics and long-range temporal correlations between\navalanches, in the presence of a temporally uniform, slow\nexternal drive. Surprisingly, this question has not yet\nbeen decided, despite the fact that, as in the case of\nearthquakes, a scale-free avalanche event dynamics (e.g.\nthe Gutenberg-Richter law) can be observed in many far\nfrom equilibrium phenomena which exhibit 1/f \u03b1 noise\n(and non-Poissonian inter-event statistics [1,15]) at vastly\n\n1\n\n\fAn appropriate choice of a time signal to detect 1/f \u03b1\nnoise, which takes the time scale separation between\nthe slow external driving and the individual avalanches\ninto account, is the total force in the system after each\navalanche:\n\nlonger time scales (e.g. days to years) compared to the\nindividual events (e.g. seconds). Perhaps the lack of a\nsufficiently convincing \"sandpile\" model has contributed\nto the ongoing debate about the relevance of SOC to solar flares, earthquakes, transport in tokamaks, and many\nother burst-like phenomena.\nThe \"sandpile\" model we discuss was introduced by\nde Sousa Vieira to describe avalanches in stick-slip phenomena [16]. It is close to the original array of connected\npendula first discussed by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld. In\ndetail, the model is defined as follows: Consider a onedimensional system of size L where a continuous variable fn \u2265 0 is associated with each site n (representing\nthe force on that site). Initially, all fn have the same\nvalue which is below a threshold fth . The basic time\nstep of the driving force consists in changing the value of\nthe force on the first site according to f1 = fth + \u03b4f\nwith a fixed \u03b4f . This can be considered as a slow\nexternal driving and leads to a fast relaxation process\n(avalanche) within the system. This relaxation consists\nof a conservative redistribution of the force at sites with\nfn \u2265 fth (toppling sites) according to fn = \u03a6(fn \u2212 fth )\nand fn\u00b11 = fn\u00b11 + \u2206fn /2. Here, \u2206fn is the change of\nforce at the overcritical site and \u03a6 a periodic, nonlinear\nfunction. The relaxation continues until all sites are stable again, i.e., fn < fth for all n. Then, the driving at the\nfirst site sets in again. This definition is complemented\nby open boundary conditions, i.e., force is lost at both\nboundaries. Without loss of generality, we use a sequential update and set fth = 1, \u03b4f = 0.1, \u03a6(x) = 1 \u2212 a[x]\nwhere [x] denotes x modulo 1/a, i.e., a sawtooth function,\nand a = 4. It was shown that the model evolves into a\nstate of SOC where the avalanche distributions are scale\nfree, limited only by the overall system size [16]. Note\nthat like other sandpile models, the toppling rules are\nconservative, and the total amount of force in the system\ncan only be changed at the boundaries.\n\nL\nX\n\nX(i) =\n\nfn (i),\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere i is the avalanche number. This signal is shown in\nFig. 1 and directly reveals the stick-slip character of the\ndynamics.\nAnalyzing the power spectrum of X(i), we find a clear\n1/f \u03b1 decay with a cut off at low frequencies that shifts\nto even lower frequencies with increasing system size (see\nFig. 2). In particular, a data collapse, shown in the inset,\nreveals the following scaling behavior:\nS(f ) \u223c\n\n1\n1\ng(\n),\nf \u03b1 f L\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03b1 = 1.38 and \u03b2 = 1.2. Here, g is a scaling function that is constant for small arguments and decays as\nx\u2212\u03b1 for large arguments. These results are somewhat\ndependent on the details of the definition of the model\n[17], a fact which does not change our main conclusion\nregarding SOC as a mechanism leading to 1/f \u03b1 noise.\n10\n\n10\n\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n903\n\n.\n\n-7\n-8\n\n\u03b1\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n902\n\n-5\n\nLog10 (f\n\n10\n\nS(f))\n\nS(f)\n\n10\n\n.\n\n-2\n\n-9\n-10\n-11\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\n2\n\n4\n\nLog10 (L f)\n\n-7\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\nf\ntotal force\n\n901\n\nFIG. 2.

It turns out that the local power spectra are simple Lorentzians with a characteristic frequency that decreases with increasing distance from the driving site.\nThus, different time signals of the same system, such as\nthe local and the total force signal, behave in a totally different manner, confirming earlier results [18].

[20] for more explanation). Since in that case,\nthe height of the interface H has the dimension of LD\u22121 ,\nthen \u03c3 2 \u223c L2(D\u22122) . Using the previous relation for \u03b2, we\nget \u03b1 = (3D \u2212 5)/(D \u2212 1) = (5\u03c4 \u2212 7)/(\u03c4 \u2212 1). This again\nagrees very well with our numerical simulation results\nand is consistent with the results in [21]. The existence\nof these scaling relations makes it clear without ambiguity that, in this model, the critical avalanche dynamics\nand the long range temporal correlations belong inseparably together.\nInstead of using the avalanche number, we can choose\ndifferent definitions for the slow time scale of the model.\nSince the force on the first site is set to fth + \u03b4f to induce\na new avalanche, one can choose to identify the amount\nof force added to the first site with the temporal interval between avalanches. This corresponds to a uniform\ndriving. Such a choice leads to non-uniform time intervals between successive relaxation events which could in\nprinciple alter the behavior. The time signal defined in\nEq. (1) is modified and becomes a sawtooth function\n\nthe observation of Lorentzians suggests that the 1/f \u03b1\nnoise could occur due to a superposition of independent\nand purely random processes each described by a characteristic time scale tc (see, e.g., Ref. [18]). However, the\nfluctuations of the force at different sites are correlated.\nThis can already be deduced from the fact that the force\nat a given site can only change if all sites closer to the\nfirst site have discharged as well. A more careful analysis\nshows that the assumption of uncorrelated (local) signals\nwould give a value of \u03b1 far away from the observed value\n[19]. Consequently, the long range temporal correlations,\nimplied by the occurrence of 1/f \u03b1 noise, are stored in the\nspatial correlations embedded in the whole system.\nThis is further confirmed by the fact that scaling relations connect \u03b1 and \u03b2 to the critical exponent characterizing the avalanche distributions. The quantity L\u03b2 in\nEq. (2) describes the scaling of the temporal cutoff and,\nhence, the scaling of the number of avalanches before\nevents become uncorrelated. Thus, it can be related to\nthe avalanche distribution. The distribution of avalanche\nsizes (the number of toppling events in the avalanche) is\ndistributed as P (s) \u223c s\u2212\u03c4 G(s/LD ), where \u03c4 \u2243 1.54 is the\nso-called histogram exponent, and the avalanche dimension D \u2243 2.20 gives the cutoff for the largest avalanche\nin a system of size L [16]. Avalanches in the power-law\nregime do not extend through the entire system; therefore\nsome sites do not topple and the system retains memory\nof its previous force. However, avalanches larger than the\ncutoff, which are the ones that entirely span the chain,\ndecorrelate the system because all sites topple and get\na new force. The frequency of the large system wide\nevents that decorrelate the force in the system scales as\nL\u2212D(\u03c4 \u22121) . Thus, \u03b2 = D(\u03c4 \u2212 1). Also, a scaling relation\nhsi \u223c L was found numerically in [16], and is a general\nresult for many boundary driven SOC systems [20], giving the result that D(2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) = 1. Combining the two\nequations, \u03b2 = D \u2212 1 = (\u03c4 \u2212 1)/(2 \u2212 \u03c4 ), which agrees\nvery well with numerical results.\nUsing scaling relations together with some previously\nobtained results concerning universality classes, we can\nrelate the exponent \u03b1 to the exponent \u03c4 or D via the\nvariance in the total force in the system:\n* L\n* L\n+!2 +\nZ\nX\nX\n2\nS(f )df = \u03c3 =\nfn (i) \u2212\nfn (i)\n, (3)\nn=1\n\nX(t) =\n\nL\nX\n\nfn (t) = t \u2212 ti +\n\nn=1\n\nL\nX\n\nfn (ti ),\n\n(4)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere ti \u2264 t denotes the time of occurrence of the last\navalanche. The power spectrum of this time signal shows\nexactly the same 1/f \u03b1 decay as the signal defined in Eq.\n(1) as can be deduced from Fig. 3. There, we show\nthe power spectrum of the differentiated signal X \u2032 (t) -\ncalled a dissipation signal for obvious reasons - which\nfollows a power law with S(f ) \u221d f 2\u2212\u03b1 . In particular,\nthe cut off to white noise behavior (\u03b1 = 0) for very low\nfrequencies occurs almost at the same frequency as before\nand the scaling with L is also unchanged. Note that\nwhite noise, (S(f ) \u223c f 0 ) in X(t) in Fig. 2, corresponds\nto S(f ) \u221d f 2 in X \u2032 (t) in Fig. 3.\nThe dissipation signal resembles the form of a pulse\ntrain, i.e.,\nX\nhi \u03b4(t \u2212 ti ),\n(5)\nX \u2032 (t) =\ni\n\nwhere hi is the dissipation in the total force due to the\nith avalanche. This form of the signal is especially wellsuited to clarify the source of the long time correlations.\nFor instance, substituting hi by a constant should reveal the correlations induced solely by the fluctuations in\nthe time intervals between dissipation events. As shown\nin [1,22], correlations between subsequent time intervals\ncan, indeed, lead to 1/f \u03b1 noise. However, here we find\nthat this \"return signal\" is uncorrelated (see Fig. 3). The\nabsence of correlations in the time intervals together with\nthe existence of a finite second moment of their distribution due to the boundedness of the intervals by fth + \u03b4f\nimplies that the power spectrum is the same as before\n\nn=1\n\nwhere the integral is over all frequencies. Since the exponent \u03b1 > 1, the power in the signal diverges as L \u2192 \u221e\nas L\u03b2(\u03b1\u22121) . As argued and supported numerically in Ref.\n[16], the \"sandpile\" model is in the same universality class\nas the original Burridge-Knopoff train model. This latter model has been conjectured to be in the universality\nclass of interface depinning with the interface pulled at\none end [20] \u2013 a result which is also supported by numerical simulations. Thus, the fluctuations in the force in\nthe system have the dimension of fluctuations of force in\n3\n\n\ffor frequencies below a certain, fixed fh . Hence, the long\ntime scales are not affected by the fluctuations in the time\nintervals. In particular, this is true for any distribution\nof time intervals with finite second moment if the time\nintervals are independent of one another (central limit\ntheorem). Thus, the 1/f \u03b1 noise is due solely to the fluctuations in hi . We conclude that the long range temporal\ncorrelations in the model are exclusively encoded in the\nstate of the whole system and are not destroyed by the\nfluctuations due to changes in the definition of the time\nscale of the external driving.\n10\n\n.\n\n-6\n\nEmail address: davidsen@theo-physik.uni-kiel.de\n[1] J.

Power spectrum of the different, differentiated,\ntime signals for L = 256 (see text). Note that in the avalanche\nand dissipation signal, an increase with f 2 as observed for the\nlowest frequencies corresponds to white noise in the integrated\nsignal. The avalanche signal is shifted down by 8 decades.\n\nThe fact that the occurrence of 1/f \u03b1 noise in the\nmodel cannot be attributed to a low-dimensional dynamics shows that the SOC mechanism is totally different\nand can be well-distinguished from other deterministic\nmechanisms which attempt to explain flicker noise as a\nchaotic phenomenon (see, e.g., Refs. [23]). Unlike those\nmechanisms, the dynamics discussed here cannot be reduced to a renewal process with a power-law distribution\nof waiting times or step sizes.\nFinally, the temporal variations in the sizes of the\navalanches show only trivial long time correlations. Fig.\n3 shows the power spectrum of the avalanche signal, defined in (5) where hi is now the number of topplings in the\nith avalanche. Clearly, a flat spectrum can be observed\nwith a change to f 2 behavior at low frequencies due to the\nfinite system size. In terms of the integrated signal X(t),\nthis corresponds to a trivial 1/f 2 decay crossing over to\nwhite noise (f 0 ) behavior at low frequencies. Hence, the\nunderlying process can be considered as a random walk\nconfined by the system size.\nTo summarize, the interplay between building up of\nforce from the external driving when the avalanches are\nsmall, balanced by dissipation of force at the boundaries when the avalanches are larger is responsible for\nthe flicker noise in this SOC model.
