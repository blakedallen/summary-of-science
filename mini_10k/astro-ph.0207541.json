Outflowing\nmaterial ejected during the star's giant eruption in 1843 surrounds it as a nebula which consists of an inner bipolar region (the Homunculus) and the Outer\nEjecta. The outer ejecta is very filamentary and shaped irregularly. Kinematic\nanalysis, however, shows a regular bi-directional expansion despite of the complex morphology. Radial velocities in the outer ejecta reach up to 2000 kms\u22121\nand give rise to X-ray emission first detected by ROSAT. We will present a detailed study of the outer ejecta based on HST images, high-resolution echelle\nspectra for kinematic studies, images from CHANDRA/ACIS and HST-STIS\nspectra.\n\n1.\n\nMorphology, kinematics and the soft X-ray emission\n\nThe outer part of the nebula around \u03b7 Carinae contains a countless number\nof knots, bullets and filaments and manifests the so-called outer ejecta (diameter 60\u2032\u2032 or 0.67 pc). A kinematic analysis using high-resolution echelle spectra\nshowed that the outer ejecta expand with velocities between \u2212600 km s\u22121 and\n+600 km s\u22121 on average (e.g. Meaburn et al. 1996, Weis 2001a,b). Various filaments nevertheless show much higher radial velocities-e.g. \u223c 2000 km s\u22121 (Weis\n2001a,b). It is still unclear what triggered the outburst in 1843 and which mechanism not only formed \u03b7 Carinae's nebula but also the amazingly high expansion\nvelocities. With velocities that high, X-ray emission from \u03b7 Carinae is expected\nand was indeed detected (e.g. Cheblowski et al. 1984, Corcoran et al. 1997).\nWith ROSAT and CHANDRA we are now able to separate between a harder,\n1\n\nFeodor-Lynen-fellow, Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKerstin Weis\nFigure\n1. In\ngrayscale the optical (F658N) HST\nimage (WF chip)\nis shown and in\ncontours the emission in the 0.61.2 keV band as\ndetected with the\nCHANDRA ACIS\nS3. Numbers indicate the expansion velocities of\ncertain areas, underlined numbers\nare negative velocities, for better illustration the font\nsize increases for\nhigher velocities.\n\nnearly point like emission from the central source and an extended softer emission from \u03b7 Carinae's outer ejecta which is roughly hook shaped (e.g. Weis et\nal. 2001). Interestingly, an overlay of the optical image and the X-ray emission\nshows only a few correlations between the optically emitting gas and the hot\nX-ray gas, see Fig. 1. A much stronger conformance was found in comparison\nwith the radial expansion velocities. The expansion velocities are derived from\nour optical echelle spectra (FWHM \u223c 14 km s\u22121 ) and overplotted in Fig. 1 with\nnegative velocities underlined. Areas with higher X-ray emission show in general\nhigher expansion velocities. The faster the gas is expanding the more intense\nis the X-ray emission. The extended soft X-ray emission from \u03b7 Carinae and\nespecially the morphology of the X-ray nebula can therefore be explained by\nfaster moving filaments which form X-ray emitting shocks. The temperature of\nthe gas (using thermal equilibrium models) is \u223c 0.65 keV (Weis et al. 2002,\nin prep.) indicating post-shock velocities of around 750 km s\u22121 in very good\nagreement with the detected expansion velocities of the bulk of the gas.\nReferences\nChlebowski, T., Seward, F.
