When a double-dot structure is made such that the dots are the\nmirror-image of each other, constructive interference can make a tunnel barrier located on the symmetry axis effectively transparent. We show (via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation) that\nthis effect can be orders of magnitude larger than the well-known universal conductance fluctuations\nand weak-localization (both less than a conductance quantum). A small magnetic field destroys the\neffect, massively reducing the double-dot conductance; thus a magnetic field detector is obtained,\nwith a similar sensitivity to a SQUID, but requiring no superconductors.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b, 05.45.Mt,73.23.Ad,74.40.+k\n\nIn the 1990s, interference effects (universal conductance fluctuations and weak-localization) were observed\nfor electrons flowing through clean quantum dots [1, 2].\nThe chaotic shape of such dots makes these effects analogous to speckle-patterns in optics rather than to the regular interference patterns observed with Young's slits or\nFabry-Perot etalons. While such interference phenomena are beautiful, they have only a small effect on the\nproperties of quantum dots coupled to multi-mode leads.\nHere we provide a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations showing that a much larger interference effect\noccurs in systems which are mirror-symmetric but otherwise chaotic [3, 4, 5, 6], see Fig. 1. We show that the\nmirror symmetry induces interference that greatly enhances tunneling through a barrier located on the symmetry axis; it can make the barrier become effectively\ntransparent. Thus an open double-dot system with an\nalmost opaque tunnel barrier between the two dots will\nexhibit a huge peak in conductance when the two dots\nare the mirror image of each other, see Fig. 2. This effect\ncould be used to detect anything which breaks the mirror\nsymmetry. For example, current 2D electron gas (2DEG)\ntechnology [7] could be used to construct a device whose\nresistance changes by a factor of ten, when an applied\nmagnetic flux changes from zero to a fraction of a flux\nquantum in the double dot. This is a sensitivity similar\nto that of a SQUID, but it is achieved without superconductivity, making it easy to integrate with other 2DEG\ncircuitry.\nOrigin of the conductance peak. The origin of the\neffect can be intuitively understood by looking at Fig. 1.\nAssume that electrons only follow the two paths shown\n(instead of an infinite number of different paths). Path 1\ndoes not tunnel the first time it hits the barrier, but does\ntunnel the second time it hits it. Path 2 tunnels the first\ntime it hits the barrier, but not the second time. Quantum mechanics gives the probability to go from the left\nlead to the right lead as |r(\u03b8)t(\u03b8\u2032 )eiS1 /~ +t(\u03b8)r(\u03b8\u2032 )eiS2 /~ |2 ,\nwhere the scattering matrix of the tunnel barrier has am-\n\npa\n\n1\n\nth\n\nth\n\npa\n\n2\n\nWtb\n\u03b8'\n\nW\nLeft\nlead\n\n\u03b8\n\nLeft dot\n\nRight dot\n\nRight\nlead\n\nFIG. 1: A mirror-symmetric double dot, where the classical\ndynamics is highly chaotic. We call it a \"butterfly double\ndot\" to emphasize the left-right symmetry. Every classical\npath from the left lead to the right lead (solid line) which hits\nthe barrier more than once, is part of a family of paths which\nare related to it by the mirror symmetry (dashed line).\n\nplitudes r(\u03b8) and t(\u03b8) for reflection and transmission at\nangle \u03b8. If there is no correlation between the classical\nactions of the two paths (S1 and S2 ), then the cross-term\ncancels upon averaging over energy, leaving the probability as |r(\u03b8)t(\u03b8\u2032 )|2 + |t(\u03b8)r(\u03b8\u2032 )|2 . In contrast, if there is a\nperfect mirror symmetry, then S2 = S1 , and the probability is |r(\u03b8)t(\u03b8\u2032 ) + t(\u03b8)r(\u03b8\u2032 )|2 , which is significantly greater\nthan |r(\u03b8)t(\u03b8\u2032 )|2 + |t(\u03b8)r(\u03b8\u2032 )|2 . Indeed, if we could drop\nthe \u03b8-dependence of r and t, the probability would be\ndoubled by the constructive interference induced by the\nmirror symmetry. A path that hits the barrier (n + 1)\ntimes has 2n partners with the same classical action (each\npath segment that begins and ends on the barrier can\nbe reflected with respect to the barrier axis). However\nthe conductance is not thereby enhanced by 2n , because\n(due to the nature of the barrier scattering matrix) there\nis also destructive interference when one path tunnels\n(4j \u2212 2) times more than another (for integer j).\nThe effect looks superficially like resonant tunneling.\nHowever, that only occurs when dots are weakly coupled\nto the leads, so that each dot has a peak for each level of\nthe closed dot and the current flow is enhanced when two\n\n\fNormalized conductance (G/G 0 )\n\n2\n0.00\n\n3.5\nL /2\n\n3\n\nL /2\n\nL /2\n\n0.01\n\nL /2\n\n(a)\n\nTtb\n\n0.02\n\n2.5\n\n10\nW tb\n\nW\n\n2\n\n8\n\nB\n\nB\n\nGsym\n\n4\n\nGasym\n\n1.5\nW tb = L = 4 \u03bc m; W = 310 nm\n\n1\n\n2\n0.4\n\n0.5\n0\n\nG tb\n\n0\n\n0\n0.6\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nP\n\n350\n\n0.8\n1.0\n\nApplied magnetic field ( \u03bcT)\nNormalized conductance (G/G 0 )\n\n6\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the ratio hGsym i/hGasym i, given by Eqs.

The latter\nmimics the effect of gates that reduce the size of one dot\nrelative to the other. The data points come from simulations\nperformed for the structures shown in the insets. The curve\ncomes from the semiclassical theory; in (b) there is no fitting\nparameter, while in (a) an unknown parameter (or order one)\nis adjusted to fit the data. The conductance of the tunnel\nbarrier alone is Gtb .\n\npeaks are aligned. Instead in our case each dot is well\ncoupled to a lead (with N \u226b 1 modes), so the density of\nstates in each dot is featureless (the broadenning of each\nlevel is about N times the level-spacing). Furthermore,\nresonant tunneling occurs at discrete energies, while our\neffect is largely energy independent. Another similar effect, called \"reflectionless tunneling\", occurs when electrons are retro-reflected as holes, due to Andreev reflection from a superconductor [8, 9]. However, this retroreflection transforms the classical dynamics in the dot\nfrom chaotic to integrable [10], and large interference effects in integrable systems are not uncommon (consider a\nFabry-Perot etalon). Here, the mirror symmetry induces\na large interference effect without any retro-reflection and\nwithout a change in the nature of the classical dynamics\n(chaotic motion remains chaotic).\nSemiclassical theory. Our analysis uses the semi-\n\nwhere G0 = 2e2 /h is the quantum of conductance, and\nS\u03b3 is the classical action of path \u03b3.

This path reflects off the barrier mR (\u03b3)\ntimes (with the kth reflection at angle \u03b8Rk ) and transmits mT (\u03b3) times (at angles \u03b8Tk ) before hitting the right\nlead at y. The factor (dpy0 /dy)\u03b3 is the stability of the\npath that would exist if the barrier were absent for each\ntransmission and impenetrable for each reflection. For\nmost pairs with \u03b3 6= \u03b3 \u2032 , the exponent in Eq. (1) varies\nfast with energy, so that averaging over energy removes\nsuch pairs from the double sum. We keep only the main\ncontributions surviving such averaging: those where \u03b3 \u2032\n\n\f3\ncan be constructed from \u03b3 by means of the reflection with\nrespect to the barrier axis (symmetry axis) of any path\nsegment that begins and ends on the barrier, for which\nS\u03b3 \u2032 = S\u03b3 at all energies (the paths thereby have the same\nstability (dpy0 /dy)\u03b3 ).

The four-by-four\n\u2020\ngives the scattering of the two\nmatrix S = Stb \u2297 Stb\npaths at the barrier. Thus Sij gives the weight to go\nfrom state j to state i, where we define state 1 as both\npaths in the left dot; state 2 as path \u03b3 in the left dot and\npath \u03b3 \u2032 in the right dot; state 3 as path \u03b3 in the right dot\nand path \u03b3 \u2032 in the left dot; and state 4 as both paths in\nthe right dot. The matrices C\u03b3,m are diagonal with the\nfollowing non-zero elements: [C\u03b3,m ]11 = [C\u03b3,m ]44 = 1\nand [C\u03b3,m ]22 = [C\u03b3,m ]\u221733 = exp[i\u03b4S\u03b3,m /~]. The action\ndifference \u03b4S\u03b3,m is that between path \u03b3 in the left dot and\nits mirror image in the right dot between the (m \u2212 1)th\nand mth collision with the barrier. For perfect symmetry\nCm = I and then the product equals [Sn ]41 .\nWe assume that the classical dynamics is sufficiently\nmixing that paths uniformly explore the dot between\nsubsequent collisions with the barrier (or leads). Defining \u03b4S0 /~ as the phase difference acquired in one time of\nflight across the dot, we have C\u03b3,m \u2243 exp[\u2212\u0393t\u03b3,m ] where\n\u0393 is a complex number, with Im[\u0393] \u2243 h\u03b4S0 i/(\u03c40 ~) and\nRe[\u0393] \u2243 var[\u03b4S0 ]/(\u03c40 ~2 ). The probability that a path\nsurvives in the dot for a time t without hitting either the\n\u2032\nbarrier or the lead is e\u2212t/\u03c4D . Using this, we replace C\u03b3,m\nby its time-average C = hC\u03b3,m i; its only non-zero elements are C11 = C44 = 1 and C22 = C\u221733 = [1 + \u0393\u03c4D\u2032 ]\u22121 .\nThus the product in Eq.

Then, defining\nP = Wtb /(Wtb + W ) as the probability for a path to hit\nthe Wtb -wide barrier before escaping into\n\u0002 -wide\n\u0003\nP the nW\nlead, we find that hGi = G0 N (1 \u2212 P ) \u221e\nP\nS\u0303n 41 ,\nn=1\nwhere N = pF W/(\u03c0~) is the number of modes in a lead.\nUpon finding the matrix, U, which diagonalizes S\u0303, one\ncan easily evaluate the geometric series in n.\nThis analysis gives the following average conductance\nof the symmetric double dot (\u0393 = 0),\nhGsym i = G0 N P (1 + P )Ttb /[(1 \u2212 P )2 + 4P Ttb], (5)\nwhere Ttb is the tunneling probability, |t(\u03b8)|2 , averaged\nover all \u03b8. For Ttb < (1 \u2212 P )/2 (i.e. for Gtb , the conductance of a barrier with transmission Ttb in a waveguide\nof width Wtb , less than P times the conductance of the\nseries of the two constrictions), one finds that hGsym i is\n\ngreater (often much greater) than the tunnel barrier conductance, Gtb . Thus symmetrically placing constrictions\non either side of the barrier can strongly enhance its conductance (this is a stark example of the fact that quantum conductances in series are not additive). In contrast,\nfor the asymmetric double dot (large \u0393) we have\nhGasym i = G0 N P Ttb /[1 \u2212 P + 2P Ttb],\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is always less than Gtb . The ratio hGsym i/hGasym i\nis plotted in Fig. 3. For any finite Ttb , the ratio is max1/2\nimal at P = (1 \u2212 2Ttb )/(1 \u2212 4Ttb ). This choice of P\ngives hGsym i = G0 N/4 and (for small Ttb ) hGasym i \u2243\n1/2\nTtb G0 N/2. Thus the conductance ratio can be arbitrarily large for a highly opaque tunnel barrier.\nPeak shape with symmetry-breaking. The effect\nof the mirror symmetry is suppressed by a perpendicular\nmagnetic field, B, or by moving the boundary of one\ndot by a distance \u03b4L. It is also suppressed by disorder\n(defined by a mean free flight time between subsequent\nscatters from disorder, \u03c4mf ) or decoherence (defined by a\ndecoherence time, \u03c4\u03c6 ). The suppression can be quantified\nin terms of the following parameters:\n\u0393B = \u03b7(eBA/h)2 /\u03c40 ,\n\u0001\n\u0393boundary = \u03c40\u22121 var[\u03b4L]/\u03bb2F + ih\u03b4Li/\u03bbF ,\n\u22121\n\u0393mf = \u03c4mf\n,\n\n\u0393\u03c6 = \u03c4\u03c6\u22121 ,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhere e is the electronic charge, A is the area of one dot,\nand \u03c40 is the time to cross the dot. In \u0393B , the constant \u03b7\nis of order one, but is hard to estimate [15]. For \u0393boundary ,\nwe have h\u03b4Li \u223c x\u03be and var[\u03b4L] \u223c x2 (\u03be \u2212 \u03be 2 ), if a fraction\n\u03be of the left dot is deformed outwards by a distance x.\nFor multiple asymmetries, the total \u0393 is the sum of the\nindividual \u0393s given above. For real \u0393,\nhG(\u0393)i = hGasym i +\n\nhGsym i \u2212 hGasym i\n,\n1 + F (P, Ttb ) \u00d7 \u0393\u03c4D\u2032\n\n(10)\n\nwhere F (P, Ttb ) = hGsym i/[hGasym i(1 + P )], and \u03c4D\u2032 \u223c\n\u03c0L\u03c40 /(W + Wtb ) is the typical time a path spends in\none dot before hitting a lead or the barrier. For the\nlarge conductance ratio (see below Eq. (6)), F (P, Ttb )\u03c4D\u2032\nis about half the dwell time in the double-dot, \u03c4D \u223c (1 \u2212\nP )\u22121 \u03c4D\u2032 . Thus the conductance is a Lorentzian function\nof the B-field, with similar width to the weak-localization\ndip in the same system with no barrier [14]. This makes\nthe system an extremely sensitive detector of magnetic\nfields and deformations of the confining potential (for\nexample due to the movement of charge near the double\ndot). Intriguingly, the peak remains when the leads are at\ndifferent positions on the two dots; it is simply suppressed\nwith an asymmetry parameter \u0393lead = (1 \u2212 P )/\u03c4D\u2032 .\nFor complex \u0393, as in Fig. 2(b), we have no analytic\nresult for hG(\u0393)i, but we can get it by numerically diagonalizing the 4-by-4 matrix, S\u0303. In Fig. 2(b), the data\nand the theory curve drop below hGasym i = 0.23G0 . We\n\n\f4\nwill show elsewhere that this is due to destructive interference. The conductance rises back up to hGasym i when\nthe barrier is moved a distance of order a wavelength.\nProposal for experimental observation. Consider making such a double-dot in an ultra-clean twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the lowest achievable temperatures [7]. A finger gate could define the\nbarrier [16], with split gates controlling the lead widths.\nTo maximize the effect for a 2DEG with a mean free\npath [7] of order 500 \u03bcm, each dot (see Fig. 2) can have\nsize L = 4 \u03bcm (circumference \u223c 3.6L \u223c 15 \u03bcm) with\n12 mode leads (W = 310 nm \u223c 6\u03bbF ). A barrier with\nTtb = 1.48\u00d710\u22123 and width Wtb = L gives P = 0.93 and\n\u03c4D\u2032 \u223c 3.5\u03c40 . In this case, hGsym i \u2243 14hGasym i \u2243 3.2G0\n(resistance Rsym \u223c 5 k\u03a9). The crossover from hGsym i\nto hGasym i happens for \u0393 \u2243 0.14/\u03c4D\u2032 \u223c 0.04/\u03c40 . At low\ntemperatures (\u03c4\u03c6 > \u03c4mf ), disorder will suppress the peak\nto about 83% of hGsym i, since F (P, Ttb )\u0393mf \u03c4D\u2032 \u223c 0.2.\nThus the double-dot conductance will drop by an order\nof magnitude if 10% of the boundary of one dot is moved\nby \u03bbF /2, or if a B-field is applied such that a fifth of a\nflux-quantum threads each dot. The latter is a B-field\nsensitivity similar to that of a SQUID.\nThe main experimental challenge will be to define dots\nthat are mirror-symmetric on a scale significantly less\nthan \u03bbF \u223c 50 nm. We suggest that each dot should be\ndefined by means of multiple gates (made as symmetric\nas possible); their voltages can then be tuned to maximise the symmetry. We propose the following protocol\nfor this maximization. Starting with very wide leads,\nin such a way that P is far from unity and the conductance peak is very broad, one scans the dot-defining gate\nvoltages over a broad range to reveal the approximate\nsymmetry point (maximal conductance). One then narrows the leads (increasing P ), making the conductance\npeak higher and narrower, and adjusts the dot-defining\ngate voltages to again maximize the conductance. Repeatedly doing this should give the symmetry point with\nincreasing accuracy, until one reaches the limit imposed\nby inherent asymmetries (disorder, etc).\nNumerical simulations. For the above maximisation we took Wtb = L and only 12 lead modes. This\ncalls into question two assumptions in the theory. Firstly,\nwe can no longer assume that paths in the dot will be\nwell randomized between collisions with the barrier, since\n\u03c4D\u2032 \u223c 3.6\u03c40 . Secondly, we may not be able to neglect\nother interference effects (weak-localization, etc), since\nhGi is at most a few G0 . Thus to verify that the effect\nis as expected in such a parameter regime, we numerically simulated a stadium billiard containing a barrier\nwith Ttb = 1.48 \u00d7 10\u22123 , see Fig. 2. We use the recursive\nGreen's function technique [17] working in real space for\nthe direction of current propagation (cut into multiple\nslices) and in mode space for the transverse direction.\nMagnetic fields are in a Landau gauge where the vector\npotential is oriented in the transverse direction [18]. The\n\nnumber of longitudinal slices and transverse modes were\nincreased until the results converged. The data shown\nhere are for 836 longitudinal slices (200 of which are in\nthe outer leads) and 200 transverse modes. We mimic\nthermal smearing, at a temperature of 23 mK, by averaging over 44 energies uniformly distributed over an interval of 0.02 meV around the Fermi energy of 9.02 meV.\nWe use the effective mass in GaAs of 0.067 m0 . The simulation (data points in Fig. 2) clearly shows that the effect\nexists in this regime. Indeed, despite the assumptions in\nits derivation, the theory (solid curve) agrees surprisingly\nwell with the numerical data.\nConcluding comment. The conductance peak is not\ndestroyed by bias voltages or temperatures greater than\n~/\u03c4D , because the mirror symmetry is present at all energies and not just at the chemical potential (unlike the\nelectron-hole symmetry for reflectionless tunneling into\na superconductor). Large biases or temperatures should\nstill be avoided, as they increase the decoherence. We\nthank M. Houzet and P. Brouwer for discussions.\n\n[1] Y. Alhassid, Rev. Mod.

(5,6). At the\nsymmetry point we observe that the more times a path\nreturns to the barrier, the more transparent the interference makes the barrier. Thus if the path takes an\ninfinite time to escape the double dot (P = 1), then the\nbarrier becomes completely transparent. However this\ndoes not generate a large conductance peak, since for\nP \u2192 1 the probability to go from the left lead to the\nright lead is a half for any finite barrier transparency,\nthus hGsym i/hGasym i \u2192 1. This is the reason for the\nmaximum conductance peak occurring when P is slightly\nless than one (as visible in Fig. 3). The opposite limit\nis P \u2192 0, then both hGsym i and hGasym i reduce to the\nconductance of the barrier alone. Since no path hits the\nbarrier more than once, there can be no interference induced enhancement of tunneling.\nComment on fitting B-field dependence. To\nmake the theory quantitative (for comparison with the\nnumerical simulations) we assumed that the area enclosed by each straight path segment from one point\non the boundary of the left dot to another is uncorrelated with the next. We define this directed area, a, as\nthat of the triangle made by the two ends of the path\nsegment and the mid-point of the barrier. Assuming\n(eBa/~) \u226a 1 we have \u0393B = 2\u03ba(eBA/h)2 /\u03c40 , where the\nsystem-specific parameter \u03ba = var(a/A). If a were uniformly distributed over the range from \u2212A/2 to A/2, we\nwould get \u03ba = 1/12. In contrast, if the distribution were\nstrongly peaked at \u2212A/2 and A/2, we would get \u03ba as big\nas 1/2. We believe only a ray-tracing simulation of the\ncavity would yield an accurate value for \u03ba, thus for the\ntheory curve in Fig. 2a we treat \u03ba as a fitting parameter.\nThe Lorentzian width of 40 \u03bcT corresponds to \u03ba = 0.17;\nwhich is within the range estimated above.\nComment on fitting barrier-position dependence. In the case shown in Fig. 2b, the mirror symmetry is only broken at the point where a path segment\nbegins or end at the tunnel barrier. Thus a path segment\nonly acquires a phase-difference from its mirror image at\nthe places where it touches the barrier. Paths acquire\nmore phase in the left dot than the right dot (since the\nbarrier is moved to the right). This phase difference has a\nvery different form from that induced by a B-field (where\nthe phase difference grows with the time a path spends\nin one of the dots). Taking this into account, we get the\nsolid curve in Fig. 2(b) without any fitting parameters.\n\n\f"}
