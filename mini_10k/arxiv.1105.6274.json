Introduction\nMany astrophysical and cosmological observations, such as Type Ia Supernovae (SNe\nIa),1\u20134 cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP),5\u20138 and the large scale structure from Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS)9, 10 have indicated that the universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion,\nwhich consequently leads to the assumption of the existence of dark energy (DE),\nan exotic energy with negative pressure and causes an accelerating expansion of our\nuniverse at late times. The most simple candidate for these uniformly distributed\ndark energy is considered to be in the form of a cosmological constant (\u039b) with a\nequation of state w = \u03c1\u039b /p\u039b \u2261 \u22121. However, the corresponding \u039bCDM model is\nalways entangled with the coincidence problem: The matter density \u03c1m decreases\n1\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nmain\n\nShuo Cao and Nan Liang\n\nwith the expansion of our universe with a\u22123 and the density of cosmological constant\n\u03c1\u039b does not change with the expansion of the universe, whereas the dark energy\ndensity is comparable with the dark matter (DM) density today, why? Although\nmany alternative models include the scalar field models with dynamical EoS (e.g.,\nthe quintessence,11\u201313 phantom,14, 15 k-essence,16, 17 as well as quintom model18\u201320 ),\nhave been proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem, the nature of dark energy\nis still a mystery and the coincidence problem is still a puzzle.\nIt is natural to take into account a possible interaction between the dark matter\nand dark energy through an interaction term. The interacting dark energy model\n(IDE) was first introduced to test the coincidence problem, in which \u03c1m could decrease with the expansion of our universe slower than a\u22123 . It should be stressed\nthat interacting dark energy scenarios have been studied by many authors. Amendola et al.(2000) investigated a coupled quintessence (CQ) model by assuming an\nexponential potential and a linear coupling,21 besides many other background and\nperturbation constraints.22\u201324 On the other hand, it is always assumed that dark\nenergy and dust matter exchange energy through an interaction term Q\n\u03c1\u0307X + 3H (\u03c1X + pX ) = \u2212Q,\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = Q,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich preserves the total energy conservation equation \u03c1\u0307tot + 3H (\u03c1tot + ptot ) = 0.\nThe interaction term Q is extensively considered in the literature .25\u201332 In these\nIDE models with linear and nonlinear interactions in the dark sector, the \u039bCDM\nmodel without interaction between dark energy and dark matter is characterized\nby Q = 0, while Q 6= 0 and denote non-standard cosmology.\nIn the previous works, various interacting DE models have been discussed with\ndifferent astronomical observations, such as SNe Ia and limited number of Hubble\nparameters. Recently, the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) have become an effective probe both in cosmology and astrophysics compared with SNe Ia,\nCMB and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and it is more rewarding to\napply OHD to investigate the the properties of the dark energy directly. The reason\nis quite simple, it is obvious that these probes all use the distance scale (e.g., the\nluminosity distance dL , the shift parameter R, or the distance parameter A) measurement to determine cosmological parameters, which needs the integrate of the\nHubble parameter and therefore lose the fine structure and some more important\ninformation of H(z).33 However, the Hubble parameter depends on the differential\n1 dz\nage as a function of redshift z in the form H(z) = \u2212 1+z\ndt , which provides a direct measurement for H(z) through a determination of dz/dt. Jimenez et al.(2003)\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the method by applying it to a z \u223c 0 sample.34 By\nusing the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the Gemini\nDeep Deep Survey (GDDS)35 and archival data,36\u201339 Simon et al.(2005) determined\n9 H(z) data in the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.8.40 These OHD data were also used to constrain\nthe parameters of cosmological models41, 42 and some other relevant works.43\u201347 For\nexample, Wei & Zhang(2007a) compared the 9 observational H(z) data with some\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nmain\n\nInteraction between dark energy and dark matter\n\n3\n\ncosmological models with/without interaction between dark energy and dust matter and found that the OHD data with fairly large errors cannot severely constrain\nmodel parameters alone.43\nIn this paper, following a phenomenological approach, we will explore the properties hidden in two particular kinds of interaction in the dark sector,43, 44, 48 and then\nconfront the theoretical models with the newly available observational data. We extend the previous analysis by focusing on the newly compiled observational Hubble\nparameter data (OHD), together with the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ndetected by the 9-year WMAP data,8 the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak\ndetected by large-scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7 (DR7),49 SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS),50 WiggleZ survey,51 6dFGS survey,52 and the newly\nrevised Union2 SNe Ia data set.53 This paper is organized as follows: In section 2,\nwe introduce the observational data considered to test our theoretical models in\nthis work, with the latter described in Section 3. In section 4, we derive two Hubble\nparameters in a flat universe and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis\nspanning the full parameter space using different data sets. In Section 5, we apply\na quantitative criteria to judge the severity of the coincidence problem in the two\nmodels. Finally, we summarize the main conclusions in Section 6.\n2. Observational data\nIn order to probe the above models against observations, we consider four background tests which are directly related to the behavior of the function H(z), i.e. the\nHubble parameter as a function of the redshift, and present the results for different\ncombined analyses of these four tests.\nBesides the 9 observational OHD data introduced in the introduction, more recently, Stern et al.(2010) obtained the OHD data at 11 different redshifts detected\nfrom the differential ages of red-envelope galaxies.55 In fact, the value of the function\nH(z) can be directly obtained from other astrophysical observations. For instance,57\nfound it possible to determine a high precision measurement of the Hubble parameter at z = 2.3 from observations of the BAO peak in the Ly \u03b1 forest. Based on\nthe above two techniques, a list of 28 independent H(z) measurements have been\ncompiled by Farooq & Ratra(2013) to constrain cosmological parameters in three\ncosmological models,54 which will also be include into our analysis. The original\ndata can be obtained in Refs. 51 and 40-59. The statistical analysis is based on the\n\u03c72 function constructed as\n\u03c72H =\n\n28\nX\n[H(zi ) \u2212 Hobs (zi )]2\ni=1\n\n2\n\u03c3hi\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Hobs (zi ) is the observational OHD data at the redshift zi , \u03c3hi is the 1\u03c3\nuncertainty.\nAs is well known, the baryonic oscillations at recombination are expected to\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nmain\n\nShuo Cao and Nan Liang\n\nleave baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the power spectrum of galaxies.

The interacting dark energy model\nIn a flat FRW metric we consider the universe composed by pressureless matter, \u03c1m ,\nand a dark energy component \u03c1X . The Friedmann equation in this case becomes\nH 2 \u2261 \u03c0G(\u03c1m + \u03c1X )/3\n\n(12)\n\nAllowing the components to interact through an interaction term Q, which can be\nan arbitrary function of the Hubble parameter H and the energy densities of dust\nmatter \u03c1m and dark energy \u03c1X , we can study the energy transfer between DM and\nDE.\nNext we need to identify the specific form of Q. In this paper, we will focus a\nsimple assumption\nQ = 3\u03b3H\u03c1,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a constant parameter quantifying the extent of interaction between dust\nmatter and dark energy. We assume that the EoS of dark energy wX \u2261 pX /\u03c1X\nis a constant in spatially flat FRW metric. When working out the value of \u03b3, we\ncan see the extent of interaction and transfer direction between dark energy and\ndark matter. For \u03b3 < 0, the energy is transferred from dark matter to dark energy;\nwhile for \u03b3 > 0, the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter, and the\ncoincidence problem can be alleviated. In the literature, two choices of Q have been\nconsidered: Q = 3\u03b3m H\u03c1m and Q = 3\u03b3d H\u03c1X . Both of two cases will be analyzed\nin the subsequent section and the model parameters are determined by applying\nthe maximum likelihood method of \u03c72 fit by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) method.62\n4. The constraint results\nIn this section we will place some constraints on the two IDE models, using the\nobservational Hubble H(z) data (OHD) and the Union2 compilation of SNe Ia.\nFollowing the method of Ref. 54, we firstly use the 28 independent OHD data\npoints to constrain cosmological model parameters and then present the results for\na combined analysis of other observational tests. Basically, the model parameters\nare determined by minimizing\n\u03c72 = \u03c72H (+\u03c72SN + \u03c72BAO + \u03c72CMB ).\n\n(14)\n\nThus, we obtain the best-fit values for six cases and calculate the corresponding\nmarginal 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 error bars as it can be seen in Table 1.\n\n4.1. The \u03b3m IDE Model\nWe firstly consider the interaction term expresses as Q = 3\u03b3m H\u03c1m . The analytical\nderivation of this model was presented in Ref. 43 and here we only display the result.\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nmain\n\n7\n\nInteraction between dark energy and dark matter\n\nIn spatially flat FRW metric, for the \u03b3m IDE model with a constant EoS of dark\nenergy wX , the Friedmann equation is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nwX \u03a9m\nwX \u03a9m\n2\n3(1\u2212\u03b3m )\nE (z) =\n(1 + z)3(1+wX ) .

Moreover, the global statistical analysis with the Union2 data set may\nalso significantly reduce the statistical errors of the four parameters, especially the\ninteraction term \u03b3m . From the results, the parameter \u03b3m , which stands for the interaction between DE and DM, seems to be vanishing or slightly larger than 0,\nwhich means it is possible to have positive coupling between DE and DM. In addition, the constraining results in this work with the joint observational data are\nmore stringent than previous results for constraining IDE model parameters with\nother combined observations, for example, the 182 Gold SNe Ia samples, the shift\nparameter of CMB given by the WMAP3 observations, the BAO measurement from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the age estimates of 35 galaxies.64\n\n4.2. The \u03b3d IDE Model\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we are interested to seek a cosmological model\nwith the interaction term related to different forms of matter density (dust matter\nor dark energy), e.g., the interaction term is proportional to the matter density of\ndark energy\nQ = 3\u03b3d H\u03c1X ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b3d corresponds to the constant quantifying the extent of interaction.

Notice that the matter density \u03a9m is weakly constrained with the observational H(z) data only.\nHowever, CMB and BAO data, which are taken as priors in our treatment and\ncombined with other data, can help test the constraining power of OHD.65 The\ncombined analysis with OHD+BAO+CMB provides the best-fit parameters as\n+0.0145\n+0.0355\nwX = \u22121.3890+0.2731\n\u22120.3145 , \u03b3d = \u22120.0195\u22120.0177 , and \u03a9m = 0.2390\u22120.0340 .

We find the same tendencies for\nboth phenomenological forms of interaction with two parameterizations of Q, i.e.,\nthe parameter \u03b3 to be a small number, |\u03b3| \u2248 10\u22122 . The small coupling result is consistent with that independently obtained by galaxy cluster analysis68 and combined\nanalysis including the look back time data.64 However, the difference between the\nconstraint results made with the two IDE models is also most sharpest concerning\nthe sign of the interaction parameter. We observe that \u03b3 > 0 when the interaction\nbetween dark sectors is proportional to the energy density of dust matter, whereas\nthe negative coupling (\u03b3 < 0) is preferred by the latest observations when the interaction term is proportional to the DE energy density. In fact, the positive coupling\nis required to alleviate the coincidence problem, which is also the requirement of\nthe second law of thermodynamics.69\nThe first possible solution to this incompatibility is the proportional relation\nbetween the values of the EoS parameter and the interaction term \u03b3d (\u03b3m ), which\ncan be seen from Fig. 1-3. Besides, the actual values of the equations of state of\ndark energy are quite different for the two phenomenological forms of interaction.\nFor the \u03b3d IDE model, the best-fit value we obtain for the EoS parameter is wX =\n\u22121.1502+0.1521\n\u22120.1641. Under this criteria, this model seems to behave in the same way as\na quintom dark energy model. However, the \u03b3m IDE model exhibits a quintessence\nbehavior and it has more possibility for the EoS parameter to cross quintessence\ndivide line wX = \u22121 at 1\u03c3 C.L. The other possible explanation to this discrepancy\nis the value of \u03a9m , compared with the \u03b3m IDE model, the \u03b3d IDE model presents a\nrelatively lower value of dust matter fraction in the universe (\u03a9m = 0.2690+0.0242\n\u22120.0232 ).\nThis result is in tension with recent constraint results on \u03a9m based on Planck\nmeasurements of CMB: the best-fit value is \u03a9\u039b = 0.315 \u00b1 0.017 in the flat case.70\n5. A quantitative criteria for coincidence problem\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the interacting dark energy models are often\ninvoked to explain and test the coincidence problem. Now we introduce the ratio r\nbetween \u03c1m and \u03c1X so that r = \u03c1m /\u03c1X . If the ratio r = \u03c1m /\u03c1X does not change\nmuch during the whole history of the universe, then the coincidence problem can\nbe solved. By combining Eq. (23), we obtain the parameter r evolving as\n\u1e59 = 3Hr(1 + r)[\n\nQ\nwX\n]\n+\n1 + r 3H\u03c1m\n\n(21)\n\nMoreover, the attractor solution in the interacting model is a necessary ingredient to\nalleviate the coincidence problem. From Eq. (21), we find the attractor solutions for\nboth IDE models depend on the values of interaction term and the EoS parameter\nof dark energy. However, compared with the \u03b3m IDE model, the negative interaction\nterm in the \u03b3d IDE model leads to negative rs , which is not physical.\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n12\n\nmain\n\nShuo Cao and Nan Liang\n\nFig. 5 illustrates other constraint results from the joint analysis of OHD, SNe\nIa, BAO and CMB. The left and right panel display the evolutions of the ratio\nr and Hubble parameter H(z) as a function of the redshift, respectively. On the\none hand, it indicates that the densities of dark energy and dark matter are the\nsame order of magnitude in the redshift range 0.0 \u2264 z \u2264 2.0. On the other hand,\nthe positive coupling obtained from the \u03b3m IDE model seems to lead to a slower\nchange of r as compared to the noninteracting case in the \u039bCDM model and the\nnegative coupling in the \u03b3d IDE model. Therefore, the coincidence problem is less\nacute concerning this interacting dark energy model.\n\n400\n\n50\nLCDM\n\u03b3 IDE\n\n350\n\nm\n\n40\n\n\u03b3 IDE\nd\n\n300\n\nr(z)\n\nH(z)\n\n30\n20\n\n250\n200\n150\n\n10\n\nLCDM\n\u03b3 IDE\n\n100\n\nm\n\n\u03b3 IDE\nd\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n50\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n\nz\n\nz\n\nFig. 5.

The model parameters are taken as\nthe best-fit values from OHD+SNe+BAO+CMB.\n\nBased on these considerations, we choose to apply a quantitative criteria to\njudge the severity of the coincidence problem.71 Under this criteria, two indices\nconcerning early coincidence (Ce ) and late coincidence (Cf ) are defined\nre\nCe = ,\nr0\nrf\n(22)\nCf = ,\nr0\nwhere re , r0 , and rf represent the energy ratio at early time, at present, and at the\nattractor value (if it exists). In order to determine the value of Ce , we take z = 100\nas a standard epoch in the early universe.71 Based on the calculation results of the\ntwo indices, we also include the third index of coincidence C in the whole history\nof the universe\nC = F (Ce )F (Cf ),\n\n(23)\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nmain\n\nInteraction between dark energy and dark matter\n\n13\n\nwhere F (x) is a function defined to avoid the problem that Ce and Cf might be\nvary in the opposite direction.71\nWe apply this criteria to the two interacting models and the results are shown\nin Table 2. For comparison, the indices for other two IDE models, the interacting\nquintessence and phantom models obtained by71 are also listed. Let us briefly comment the results in the presence of different forms of coupling. As can be seen in\nTable 2, the coincidence index C for the \u03b3m IDE model is smaller than that for the\n\u03b3d IDE model, the interacting quintessence and phantom models by four orders of\nmagnitude, which provides a piece of positive evidence that the \u03b3m IDE model may\nalleviates the coincidence problem.\nTable 2.

Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have examined, with the newly revised OHD versus redshift data,\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) detected by the 9-year WMAP data, the\nbaryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak detected by large-scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7\n(DR7), SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), WiggleZ survey,\nand 6dFGS survey, as well as the newly revised Union2 SNe Ia data set, to constrain\ntwo phenomenological interaction models for dark energy and dark matter, which\nare proposed as candidates to ease the coincidence problem of the concordance\n\u039bCDM model. We find that, for the \u03b3m IDE and \u03b3d IDE models where \u03b3m and \u03b3d\nquantify the extent of interaction, although the OHD data can not tightly constrain\nthe model parameters, stringent constraints can be obtained in combination with\nthe CMB, BAO, and Union2 SNe Ia observations.\nFor\nthe\n\u03b3m IDE model, we obtain the best-fit values for the parameters: (wX , \u03b3m , \u03a9m ) =\n+0.0048\n+0.0287\n(\u22120.9378+0.1726\n\u22120.1619 , 0.0073\u22120.0034, 0.2940\u22120.0268 ). For the \u03b3d IDE model, the best-fit\n+0.0147\n+0.0242\nvalues are (wX , \u03b3d , \u03a9m ) = (\u22121.1502+0.1521\n\u22120.1641 , \u22120.0137\u22120.0153, 0.2690\u22120.0232 ). These\nresults are consistent with and more stringent than the previous constraint analysis.31, 32, 64 More precisely, we find the same tendencies for both phenomenological\nforms of interaction term Q, i.e., the parameter \u03b3 to be a small number, |\u03b3| \u2248 10\u22122 .\nThe small coupling result is consistent with that obtained independently by galaxy\ncluster analysis68 and combined analysis including the look back time data.64 However, the difference between the constraint results made with the two interacting\n\n\fNovember 2, 2018 1:59 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n14\n\nmain\n\nShuo Cao and Nan Liang\n\ndark energy models is also most sharpest concerning the sign of the interaction\nparameter \u03b3. We observe that \u03b3 > 0 when the interaction between dark sectors\nproportional to the energy density of dust matter, whereas the negative coupling\n(\u03b3 < 0) is preferred by the latest observations when the interaction term is proportional to the DE energy density. The positive coupling is required to alleviate the\ncoincidence problem, which is also the requirement of the second law of thermodynamics.\nWe also find two possible explanations to this incompatibility. One is the proportional relation between the values of the EoS parameter and the interaction term\n\u03b3d (\u03b3m ), which can be seen from Fig. 1-3. Besides, the actual values of the equations of state of dark energy are quite different for the two phenomenological forms\nof interaction. The \u03b3d IDE model seems to behave in the same way as a quintom\ndark energy model. However, the \u03b3m IDE model exhibits a quintessence behavior\nand it has more possibility for the EoS parameter to cross quintessence divide line\nwX = \u22121 at 1\u03c3 C.L. The other possible explanation of this discrepancy is the value\nof \u03a9m , compared with the \u03b3m IDE model, the \u03b3d IDE model presents a relatively\nlower value of dust matter fraction in the universe, which is in tension with recent\nconstraint results on \u03a9m based on Planck measurements.\nFinally, in order to study the coincidence problem through a detailed analysis,\nwe also apply a quantitative criteria for the determination of the severity of the coincidence problem. Applying this criteria to the \u03b3m IDE and \u03b3d IDE models, we find\nthat the \u03b3m IDE model may alleviate the coincidence problem, because its coincidence index C is smaller than that for the \u03b3d IDE model, the interacting quintessence\nand phantom models by four orders of magnitude. We are looking forwards to see\nwhether these results may be changed with future observational data including high\nredshift SNe Ia data from SNAP,35 more precise Gamma Ray Bursts data,72, 73 and\ngravitational lensing data.74\u201377\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\nunder the Distinguished Young Scholar program (Grant Nos. 10825313 and\n11073005), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 program, Grant\nNo. 2012CB821804), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Scientific Research Foundation of Beijing Normal University.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nA.
