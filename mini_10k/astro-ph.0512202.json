The spectra\ncover the nucleus and the central 6.0\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.4\u2032\u2032 of the ionization cones at a spatial resolution of approximately 0.4\u2032\u2032 (\u224830 parsecs). The spectra extracted in\n0.4\u2032\u2032 steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum slope, silicate\nfeature profile and depth, and fine structure line fluxes on subarcsecond scales,\nillustrating in unprecedented detail the complexity of the circumnuclear regions\nof this galaxy at mid-IR wavelengths. A comparison of photometry in various\napertures reveals two distinct components: a compact (radius < 15 pc), bright\nsource within the central 0.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.4\u2032\u2032 and extended, lower brightness emission.\nWe identify the compact source with the AGN obscuring torus, and the diffuse\ncomponent with the AGN-heated dust in the ionization cones. While the torus\nemission dominates the flux observed in the near-IR, the mid-IR flux measured\nwith apertures larger than about 1\u2032\u2032 is dominated instead by the dust emission\nfrom the ionization cones; in spite of its higher brightness, the torus contributes\nless than 30% of the 11.6 \u03bcm flux contained in the central 1.2\u2032\u2032 region. Many\nprevious attempts to determine the torus spectral energy distribution are thus\nlikely to be significantly affected by contamination from the extended emission.\nThe observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy torus\nmodels, the first detailed comparison of such models with observational data.\nThe models require most of the mid-IR emitting clouds to be located within a\nfew parsecs of the central engine, in good agreement with recent mid-IR interferometric observations. We also present a UKIRT/CGS4 5 \u03bcm spectrum covering\nthe R(0) \u2013 R(4) lines of the fundamental vibration-rotation band of 12 CO. None\nof these lines was detected, and we discuss these non-detections in terms of the\nfilling factor and composition of the nuclear clouds.\nSubject headings: dust, extinction - galaxies: active - galaxies: nuclei -\ninfrared: galaxies - galaxies: individual(NGC 1068)\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe advent of the unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN; e.g. Antonucci 1993),\nwith its torus of dusty material, helped make sense of many of the observed properties of\nthe numerous classes of active galaxy, but has brought with it its own set of challenges. An\nintense modeling effort has been under way with the aim of understanding and predicting\nthe emission from dusty tori and explaining the observational data (Pier & Krolik 1992,\n1993; Granato & Danese 1994; Efstathiou et al. 1995; Manske et al. 1998; Nenkova et al.\n2002; van Bemmel & Dullemond 2003; Schartmann et al. 2005), and with some success\nin matching the gross infrared properties of AGN, but several observations have proven\nparticularly difficult to reproduce. Especially problematic have been the width of the IR\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs), the similarity of the observed SEDs given the wide\nrange of variation in X-ray column densities, and, most notoriously, the behavior of the 9.7\n\u03bcm silicate feature. While the feature is commonly seen in absorption in type 2 objects\n(Roche et al. 1991; Siebenmorgen et al. 2004), the corresponding emission feature expected\nfor type 1 objects has to date only been detected in a handful of objects, mostly QSOs (Hao\net al. 2005; Siebenmorgen et al. 2005; Sturm et al. 2005). Torus models must therefore be\ncapable of producing a silicate feature in type 2 AGN while suppressing it in most type 1\nobjects.\nRecently, progress has been made towards overcoming some of these problems. For\ninstance, using a model in which the dust is contained in discrete clouds, thought to be\nnecessary to ensure dust survival in the harsh AGN environment, Nenkova et al. (2002) were\nable to construct SEDs broad enough to match typical observed SEDs. In these models,\nthe silicate absorption feature was visible in an edge-on view of the torus but the emission\ncould be greatly weakened in a face-on view. By biasing the grain size distribution to\nlarge sizes, van Bemmel & Dullemond (2003) were able to suppress the silicate emission\nfeature, although their models tend to predict larger torus inner radii (\u226510 pc) than recent\nobservational limits (see below). Schartmann et al. (2005) were also able to suppress the\nsilicate emission and fit the mean type 1 SED by introducing different sublimation radii\nfor large and small grains. Given advances such as these, torus models will benefit from\nhigh-quality observations against which they can be thoroughly tested.\nRecent high spatial resolution observations of several active galaxies at 10 and 20 \u03bcm,\nwhere a torus re-emits a substantial fraction of the radiation incident upon it, indicate that\nthe tori may be very small. For example, the outer diameter of the mid-IR emitting dust\nassociated with the torus has been shown to be no greater than a few parsecs in NGC 1068\nand the Circinus galaxy (Jaffe et al. 2004; Packham et al. 2005), and \u226435 pc in NGC 4151\n(Radomski et al. 2003), although cooler dust at larger distances is not ruled out. At the same\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntime, some AGN are also associated with extended mid-IR emission from dust on scales of a\nfew hundred parsecs or larger (Maiolino et al. 1995; Krabbe et al. 2001; Radomski et al. 2002;\nGorjian et al. 2004; Siebenmorgen et al. 2004). On moving from large to small apertures, the\nIR spectrum of an active galaxy will often change from being dominated by PAH emission\nbands to showing a featureless continuum or silicate absorption feature (Le Floc'h et al. 2001;\nSoifer et al. 2002; Siebenmorgen et al. 2004). Where the AGN component can be spectrally\nisolated from large-aperture data, the expected clear dichotomy in hard X-ray/mid-IR flux\nratios between types 1 and 2 AGN is not observed, perhaps because dust heated by the\nnuclear source but not associated with the torus itself is contributing to the mid-IR flux\n(Lutz et al. 2004a). It is therefore clear that observations at the highest possible spatial\nresolution will be necessary to disentangle the torus and extended emission and provide a\nfair test for models of the dusty torus.\nAs one of the nearest, brightest and best-studied AGN, the archetypal Seyfert 2 galaxy,\nNGC 1068 (14.4 Mpc distant for H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ; 1\u2032\u2032 = 72 pc), is an excellent\ncandidate for mid-IR observations at high spatial resolution. The existence of a hidden broad\nline region in NGC 1068, as revealed by the broad emission lines detected in polarized light\n(Antonucci & Miller 1985), along with evidence for high extinction along our line of sight,\nstrongly suggests the presence of obscuring dust in a toroidal geometry. Further evidence\nfor a torus comes from the strong nuclear mid-IR source coupled with emission from ionized\ngas extended in a roughly conical structure oriented approximately northeast - southwest\n(e.g. Macchetto et al. 1994). Modeling of 10 \u03bcm interferometric observations of the nucleus\nsuggests a hot, compact (\u22641 pc) structure, surrounded by a more extended (approx. 2\u00d73\npc) warm component, interpreted as dust in the hot inner wall of the torus (Jaffe et al.\n2004). Larger-scale 10 and 20 \u03bcm emission from NGC 1068 is observed to extend out from\nthe central source to the northeast and southwest (Braatz et al. 1993; Cameron et al. 1993;\nAlloin et al. 2000; Galliano et al. 2005); further out, low surface brightness mid-IR emission\nis detected from a ring of star formation located at kiloparsec distances from the nucleus\n(Telesco & Decher 1988).\nThe 9.7 \u03bcm silicate feature is seen in absorption in NGC 1068 (Roche et al. 1984;\nJaffe et al. 2004; Siebenmorgen et al. 2004; Rhee & Larkin 2005). Previous narrow-band\nimaging suggests that the depth of the absorption varies over the nuclear region (Bock et al.\n2000; Galliano et al. 2003), but the spatial coverage and spectral resolution of those studies\nhas been insufficient to allow detailed conclusions about the distribution and profile of the\nfeature to be drawn. We have therefore performed spatially resolved N band spectroscopy\nof the nucleus and ionization cones of NGC 1068 with Michelle, the mid-IR imager and\nspectrometer on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The spatial resolution of the spectra,\napproximately 0.4\u2032\u2032 , allows us to separate the nuclear and extended emission regions and\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nreveals the distribution of the silicate feature across the nuclear region. Having largely\nisolated the spectrum of the torus in the spectrum of the central 0.4\u00d70.4\u2032\u2032 (\u2248 30\u00d730 pc) of\nNGC 1068, we compare it with the clumpy torus model of Nenkova et al. (2002). The data\nset also allows us to examine the detailed spatial distribution of fine structure emission lines\nin the 10 \u03bcm region, which have been reported previously only in very large aperture ISO\nmeasurements (Lutz et al. 2000) or in few-arcsecond aperture ground-based spectroscopy\n(Siebenmorgen et al. 2004).\nIn \u00a72 we describe the observations and reduction of the data, while \u00a73 presents the\nresults obtained for the acquisition images, nuclear spectra and model comparison, extended\nsilicate feature and emission lines. We also report the results of a sensitive search at 5 \u03bcm\nfor CO lines towards the nucleus of NGC 1068, which serves as a probe of the nature and\ndistribution of molecular gas near the center of this galaxy. The implications of this work\nare discussed in \u00a74 and summarized in \u00a75.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n2.1.\n\nN-band spectroscopy\n\nN-band acquisition images and spectra of the nucleus of NGC 1068 were obtained during commissioning of Michelle (Glasse et al. 1997) on Gemini North. Observations were\nperformed on UT 2004 August 10 (epoch 1) and repeated on 2005 January 31 (epoch 2).\nIn each case the 2-pixel (0.4\u2032\u2032 ) wide slit, oriented at 20 \u25e6 east of north, was used together\nwith the lowN grating, resulting in a dispersion of 0.024 \u03bcm/pixel and R\u223c200. Observations\nwere made using a standard chop-nod technique to remove time-variable sky background,\ntelescope thermal emission and to reduce the effect of 1/f noise from the array/electronics.\nThe chop throw was 15\u2032\u2032 , fixed at 20\u25e6 east of north, and the target was nodded the same\namount along the slit. Extended emission has been detected at \u223c15\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus,\nbut its surface brightness (usually <<10 mJy/arcsec2 ; Telesco & Decher 1988) is negligible\ncompared to that of the region from which spectra were extracted. As fast tip/tilt guiding\nis possible in only the on-source beam, the data used were on-source only and the quoted\nexposure times are for the on-source data.\nIn both epochs we obtained acquisition images with on-source integration times of 4\nseconds through the Si-5 11.6\u03bcm filter (\u2206\u03bb = 1.1\u03bcm, 50% cut-on/off). In spectroscopic\nmode, on-source integration times were 1043 s for the first epoch and 680 s for the second.\nThe plate scale of Michelle is 0.099\u2032\u2032/pixel in imaging mode and 0.198\u2032\u2032 /pixel in spectroscopic\nmode. The weather was good for both epochs and the FWHM of the standard star was\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmeasured to be 0.35\u2032\u2032 on the first and 0.43\u2032\u2032 on the second. The diffraction limit (1.22\u03bb/D)\nof the telescope at the cut-on of the Si-5 filter is 0.34\u2032\u2032 .\nThe orientation of the slit on the galaxy, and the area from which spectra were extracted,\nare shown in Fig. 1. The figure illustrates that the slit was aligned to the peak brightness\nof NGC 1068 to better than 0.1\u2032\u2032 on the second epoch and to around 0.2\u2032\u2032 on the first,\nwith the difference attributable to slight pointing errors during instrument commissioning.\nTo investigate the possibility that the object drifted out of the spectroscopic slit during the\nobservation, due to effects such as guiding errors or differential refraction between the optical\nguide camera and the mid-IR science beam, we split the observation into several sections\nand measured the peak emission in each. The counts changed by \u22646% and \u226410% on the\nfirst and second nights respectively, typical of MIR photometric variations (e.g. Radomski\net al. 2002; Packham et al. 2005), implying that any drifts in guiding were less than 0.1\u2032\u2032 .\nMichelle data files contain planes consisting of the difference for each chopped pair\nfor each nod-set. Using the Gemini IRAF package, these difference images were combined\nuntil a single frame was created. During this process the chopped pairs were examined to\nidentify any obviously compromised by anomalously high background, electronic noise, or\nother problems; it was not judged necessary to exclude any frames from the final images.\nFinally, the resultant image was divided by a spectroscopic flat field. The spectra were\nextracted in 0.4\u2032\u2032 sections (2 pixels along the slit in spectroscopic mode, corresponding well\nto the average seeing disc over the two epochs), covering the central few arcseconds of\nNGC 1068, stepping outwards from an aperture centered on the flux peak. Michelle spectra\nshow a slight (< 1 pixel) curvature across the array, which was measured using the standard\nstar data and the resulting apertures used in extracting the NGC 1068 spectra. The spectra\nwere wavelength calibrated to an accuracy of 0.02 \u03bcm using the telluric absorption lines\npresent in the peak NGC 1068 spectrum, and then divided by the standard star (BS 1101,\nF9V) and multiplied by a 6000 K blackbody curve.\nCancellation of the deep telluric O3 band in the spectra extracted at distances \u22654 pixels\n(0.8 ) from the nucleus was poor, so a spectrum of the O3 feature (derived from the standard\nstar spectra set to zero outside the band) was added back into the star spectra in varying\namounts and these \"composite\" star spectra used to divide out the telluric band in those\nNGC 1068 spectra. The scaling of the O3 band in the star spectra was determined by\ncomparing the depth of the resulting, ratioed NGC 1068 spectra at 9.7 \u03bcm with that of a\nspline fit to the ratioed NGC 1068 spectra, with the 9.3-10.0 \u03bcm region excluded from the\nfit.\n\u2032\u2032\n\nFlux calibration was achieved through comparison with BS 1101, whose N band magni-\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ntude was taken to be 2.91 . The resulting spectral flux densities are expected to be accurate to\nabout \u00b120%. The calibration agreed to within 40% between the two epochs, with the second\nepoch's data being higher in flux and thus closer to other small-aperture measurements in\nthe literature (Tomono et al. 2001; Jaffe et al. 2004). The difference in flux between the two\nepochs is probably mainly due to the small difference in the positioning of the slit.\nFine structure line emission by the [Ar III]+[M VII] blend at 8.99 \u03bcm, [S IV] at 10.51 \u03bcm,\nand [Ne II] at 12.81 \u03bcm (rest wavelengths) was readily apparent out to several arcseconds\nfrom the nucleus. Line fluxes were computed from the averages of 4-6 data points centered\non each of the line wavelengths and five continuum points on either side of each line. The\nuncertainty in the derived line fluxes is expected to be small except very near the center,\nwhere line-to-continuum ratios are very low and systematic errors dominate (particularly in\nderiving the [Ne II] flux at the edge of the N band window). Apart from these lines, no other\nnarrow spectral features are apparent in the reduced spectra.\nSlit losses were estimated from the profile of the star along the slit (which was assumed\nto be circularly symmetric) to be \u223c50% on both nights. The spatial distributions of all three\nfine structure lines appear to be fairly smooth, with no major contributions from pointlike\nsources, so to correct for systematic overestimates in fluxes resulting from slit losses in the\nstandard star spectrum used for flux calibration, measured line fluxes at all slit positions\nwere multiplied by a factor of 0.5. At positions &6 pixels from the peak, the continuum flux\nalso approaches a smooth spatial distribution, whereas at the nucleus it appears dominated\nby a pointlike source (although somewhat smoothed by small tracking errors, differential\nrefraction etc. during the long integration). No correction for slit losses has been applied to\nthe continuum flux density, but the effect of any correction would be to increase the degree\nto which it is concentrated on the nucleus.\n\n2.2.\n\nM-band spectroscopy\n\nA high resolution M-band spectrum of NGC 1068 was obtained at UKIRT on UT 1998\nDecember 29. The spectrum was acquired with the facility instrument, CGS4 (Mountain\net al. 1990), using its 31 l/mm echelle. The slit width was 0.9\u2032\u2032 and the velocity resolution\nwas 20 km/s (R=15,000). The total exposure time was 18.7 minutes. The spectrum of\nNGC 1068 was ratioed by the spectrum of HR 804 (A3V), which was observed both before\nand after NGC 1068 in order to provide a precise airmass match. The pressure-broadened\nPf beta line in HR 804 produces a broad emission bump in the ratioed spectrum, centered\n1\n\nwww.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/michelle/MichSpecStd.html\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nat 4.654 \u03bcm; this was removed by dividing by a heavily smoothed (Gaussian FWHM = 300\nkm/s) version of the ratioed spectrum.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nThe acquisition images\n\nThe 11.6 \u03bcm acquisition images (Fig. 1), taken to assist in positioning the nucleus in\nthe slit, reveal features similar to those detected in previous high spatial resolution mid-IR\nimaging of NGC 1068. As shown by Tomono et al. (2001), NGC 1068 is initially extended\nin a roughly north-south direction centered on the nucleus. The northerly extension is at a\nposition angle (PA) of \u223c 14 \u25e6 within \u223c 0.5\u2032\u2032 , turning easterly to a PA of \u223c20 \u25e6 around 1\u2032\u2032 from\nthe nucleus. The southern extension is at a PA of 190 \u25e6 at 0.5\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, bending\nwesterly further from the nucleus. The features described above agree well with those in\nthe literature, especially those described by Bock et al. (2000), Tomono et al. (2001) and\nGalliano et al. (2005).\nNortheast of the nucleus, at around PA=35 \u25e6 and 1.8\u2032\u2032 and 3.7\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, extended knots of emission previously detected by Alloin et al. (2000) are observed. However, in\nour higher spatial resolution data, we also resolve a low surface brightness south-southwestern\nknot of emission just under 4\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus at PA=205\u25e6 , also recently detected by Galliano et al. (2005). The approximate centers of the northeastern and south-southwestern\nknots are located close to a line running radially through the nucleus. The mid-IR extensions are enclosed within the near-IR polarization structures observed both north and\nsouth of the nucleus by Packham et al. (1997), who interpreted the structure as scattering\nfrom electrons within the ionization cones. Clearly the 20 \u25e6 position angle of the slit closely\nmatches the orientation of the regions of extended emission &1\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus described\nabove.\nIn the Gemini images the central core is resolved in the direction along the ionization\ncones (PA\u223c20\u25e6 ), with FWHM\u22480.5\u2032\u2032 , but is unresolved perpendicular to the cones. This implies a deconvolved extent of \u223c0.3\u2032\u2032 along the cones and \u22640.2\u2032\u2032 perpendicular. That is similar\nto the size derived by Tomono et al. (2001) from deconvolution of Subaru images. Table 1\nlists the flux density F measured in various apertures A together with the corresponding\nbeam-averaged surface brightness F/A2 . At the 14.4 Mpc distance to NGC 1068, the observations cover dust emission within radial distances from \u223c 15 pc to & 300 pc around the\nnucleus. The results are in good agreement with the findings of Jaffe et al. (2004), whose\nreported flux density for a 0.4\u2032\u2032 aperture is 12 Jy, with a scatter between 11 Jy and 13.5 Jy.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nN\nE\n\n1\"\n\nGAIA::Skycat\n\nadd107_108_rot110_flux_smooth2.sdf\n29.5 \u221265.5\n\npackham\n\nJun 16, 2005 at 13:27:56\n\nFig. 1.- Central portion of the 11.6 \u03bcm acquisition image of NGC 1068 (epoch 1) with the\nposition of the spectroscopic slits for each epoch overlaid (thick line - epoch 2; thin line\n- epoch 1). Contours are linearly spaced at intervals of 50\u03c3 (starting at 3\u03c3, or 0.05 Jy/sq.\narcsec.).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nTogether, the observations reveal the presence of two distinct emission components:\nlow-brightness emission from dust in the ionization cones extending to hundreds of pc, and\nbright emission from a central compact source, identified as the AGN obscuring torus by Jaffe\net al. (2004). The torus is resolved by the interferometric observations, which show that its\nmid-IR size is \u223c 3pc (0.04\u2032\u2032 ), much smaller than our angular resolution. Therefore in our\nobservations the torus is effectively a point source within the central 0.4\u2032\u2032 diameter region.\nHowever, because the brightness of this region is much higher than that of the surrounding\narea, its spectrum is dominated by the torus flux. Indeed, the mean color temperature\nestimated from our flux densities at 8 \u03bcm and 13 \u03bcm in the central spectrum (\u00a73.2) is\n\u223c330 K, in good agreement with Jaffe et al. (2004). On the other hand, the flux collected\nby the larger apertures is dominated by the ionization cones' lower surface brightness diffuse\nemission. For example, in 1.2\u2032\u2032 and 4\u2032\u2032 diameter apertures centered on the nucleus, the\ncore contributes less than 30% and 20%, respectively, of the total flux. The extended dust\nemission from the ionization cones was previously noted by Alloin et al. (2000) and Bock\net al. (2000), and our observations clarify the relative importance of the flux from the torus\nand the cones. Like previous high spatial resolution mid-IR imaging studies, our images\nshow no evidence for mid-IR emission extending several tenths of an arcsecond east and\nwest of the nucleus, as reported by Marco & Alloin (2000) at L and M.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe mid-IR spectra\n\nSpectra of the nucleus and ionization cones of NGC 1068, extracted in 0.4\u2032\u2032 steps (as\ndescribed in \u00a72), are shown in Fig. 2 for both epochs. All of the spectra consist of a strong\ndust continuum upon which a broad silicate absorption feature and narrow fine structure\nlines are present. At each slit position the shapes of the two spectra are similar, showing\nbroadly similar changes in spectral slope and silicate depth with distance from the nucleus.\nThe relative weakness of the epoch 1 spectrum on the nucleus results from the slit on that\ndate being slightly offset from the peak of the emission which, unlike the emission from\nthe ionization cones, is unresolved in the east-west direction. Fig. 3 highlights the good\nagreement of the profiles of the two central spectra.\nThe depth of the silicate absorption feature is an important parameter in modeling of\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN and hence has been studied in detail for\nNGC 1068 and several other AGN (Roche et al. 1991; Siebenmorgen et al. 2004). However,\nmost previous MIR observations of AGN have lacked the spatial and/or spectral resolution\nto probe the nucleus with minimal contamination from the surrounding MIR-emitting regions. The observations presented here accomplish this and also provide the opportunity to\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Spectra extracted in 0.4\u2032\u2032 steps over the central 0.4\u00d76\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1068 along position\nangle 20 \u25e6 (black - epoch 2; grey - epoch 1). Position designations are north-northeast\n(NNE) and south-southwest (SSW) of the nucleus with offsets in arcsec of the center of the\n0.4\u2032\u2032 -wide extraction aperture relative to the mid-IR flux peak. No correction has been made\nfor slit loss effects, which are different for the lines and continuum (see \u00a72). The dashed lines\nindicate the positions of the [Ar III/Mg VII] blend at 8.99 \u03bcm and the [S IV] 10.51 \u03bcm and\n[Ne II] 12.8 \u03bcm fine structure lines, while the hatching shows the approximate extent of the\ntelluric O3 band. A bad column partly overlapping the 8.99 \u03bcm emission feature has been\ninterpolated over in the epoch 2 data.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nspectroscopically study the extended silicate feature along the ionization cones of NGC 1068,\nas well as the emission lines within the cones.\nWe quantify the depth of the observed silicate feature using \u03c49.7 . This quantity would\nbe the 9.7 \u03bcm optical depth of an absorbing screen in front of a background source when\nthe screen emission is negligible. In realistic configurations the relation of \u03c49.7 to actual\noptical thickness is more complex, but it is still a meaningful phenomenological indicator. To\nestimate the 9.7 \u03bcm continuum we interpolated between the median of the spectrum near 8.2\nand 12.4 \u03bcm, wavelengths chosen to be outside the silicate feature as far as possible without\nincluding regions of poor telluric cancellation or the 12.8 \u03bcm [Ne II] emission line. The\nprocedure is equivalent to fitting a linear continuum to the spectra; the limited wavelength\nextent of the N-band atmospheric window, only slightly wider than the silicate feature itself,\nmakes determination of the true underlying continuum shape difficult, but we believe that\nthis simple approach is at least indicative. 1\u03c3 uncertainties were estimated from the scatter\nof the data points around 8.2, 9.7 and 12.4 \u03bcm used in the calculation of \u03c49.7 .\nIt has been pointed out by many authors that PAH emission features on the short\nand long wavelength sides of the silicate absorption feature (8.6 and 11.3 \u03bcm) can serve\nto exaggerate the depth of the feature, particularly when the spectral resolution is very low\nand/or spatial resolution is limited. The larger-aperture spectra of Le Floc'h et al. (2001) and\nSiebenmorgen et al. (2004) show no evidence of the PAH features, but by themselves cannot\nrule out contributions by PAHs in regions as small as the Gemini/Michelle slit segments.\nIn the high spatial resolution R\u223c200 Michelle spectra presented here, however, there is no\nindication, in any of the spectra, of the PAH features, in particular of the 11.3 \u03bcm band,\nwhich would be easily recognized at this resolving power. The absence of PAH emission\nsimplifies estimates of \u03c49.7 . However, the peak of the silicate band unfortunately coincides\nwith the broad atmospheric O3 absorption band centered at 9.6 \u03bcm, which limits the accuracy\nof \u03c49.7 , particularly in spectra far from the nucleus.\nIn the following sections, we discuss in detail the continuum slope, the silicate absorption\nat the nucleus, the more extended silicate feature, and the emission lines. We assume\nthroughout that the brightest mid-IR continuum point marks the buried central engine of\nNGC 1068.\n\n3.2.1. Continuum slope\nThe slope of the continuum is markedly different within about 0.4\u2032\u2032 of the nucleus than\nat larger distances. Although there is some variation outside this region, at all of the outer\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Spectra extracted from a 0.4\u00d70.4\u2032\u2032 region centered on the flux peak (black - epoch\n2; grey - epoch 1 \u00d7 1.4). Also shown are the Rhee & Larkin (2005) spectrum of the central\n0.25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.25\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1068 (dashed; scaled to match the Michelle spectrum around 12 \u03bcm)\nand the single-dish MIDI spectrum of Jaffe et al. (2004, dash-dotted).\nslit positions the continuum increases strongly to longer wavelengths. In the central three\nspectra, however, the spectral slope in F\u03bd is significantly less steep, with the bluest continuum\nseen at the nucleus. The color temperature of the mid-IR emitting dust, as estimated from\nthe difference in flux densities at 8 \u03bcm and 13 \u03bcm in the central spectrum, is \u223c330 K in\nthe core (as noted above), whereas the dust temperature is typically 275 K for distances of\n0.8\u2032\u2032 and greater. Note that although the radio emission to the northeast of the nucleus is\nattributed to synchrotron emission with (in places) a fairly flat spectrum (Gallimore et al.\n1996b), the integrated 5 GHz flux density in a 1\u2032\u2032 .5 x 1\u2032\u2032 .9 beam, about 600 mJy (Gallimore\net al. 1996a), can only account for a small fraction of the observed mid-IR emission (see also\nVillar-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. 2001).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n14\n\nFlux Density (Jy)\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\nWavelength (\u03bcm)\n\n12\n\n13\n\nFig. 4.- Fits of the clumpy torus model to the 10 \u03bcm spectrum of NGC 1068 (heavy\nsolid line).

The nuclear silicate absorption feature\nIn the Michelle spectra of the central 0.4\u2032\u2032 core (Fig. 3), \u03c49.7 = 0.39 \u00b1 0.02 for epoch\n1 and \u03c49.7 = 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 for epoch 2. The N-band spectrum of NGC 1068 has also been\nmeasured by Jaffe et al. (2004) in a 0.4\u2032\u2032 slit and by Rhee & Larkin (2005) in a 0.25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.25\u2032\u2032\naperture (Fig. 3). We estimate \u03c49.7 \u2248 0.30 for the total flux spectrum of Jaffe et al. (2004),\nin rough agreement with the results presented here, although their spectrum has a somewhat\nshallower decline towards shorter wavelengths than ours. The Rhee & Larkin (2005) data\nbear a close resemblance to the Michelle spectra.\nTo gain insight into the dust distribution in the central 0.4\u2032\u2032 (\u2248 30pc) of NGC 1068, we\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ncompare the nuclear spectrum with the models of Nenkova et al. (2002), who consider radiative transfer in clumpy distributions of material. In these models the angular distribution\nof the clouds is a Gaussian centered on the equatorial plane. The clouds follow a power law\ndistribution in radius, r, with number declining as r \u2212q . The emergent emission, calculated\nfor all viewing angles, is a function of Nc , the average number of clouds along an equatorial\nradius, and \u03c4V , the optical depth per cloud in the V band. In fitting the models to the data,\nwe characterize the continuum spectra in terms of three quantities: m1 , the dimensionless\nslope from 8.0-9.0 \u03bcm, m2 , the dimensionless slope from 11.0-12.5 \u03bcm, and f8\u221212 , the ratio of flux densities at 8 and 12 \u03bcm. We considered a coarse grid of 20 \u2264 \u03c4V \u2264 200 and\n5 \u2264 Nc \u2264 20. All the model slopes tend to be steeper for smaller values of q. For a given\nvalue of q, the slopes exhibit small (10%) variations with viewing angle. The variation in\nslope is more strongly correlated with Nc , changing by 50% when Nc changes by 5. Scaling\na model to the observed flux determines the intrinsic AGN luminosity, LAGN .\nIn fitting the nuclear spectrum, we require inclination angle i = 80 or 90\u25e6 , as indicated\nby water masers (Greenhill & Gwinn 1997). With this constraint, we find \u03c4V \u2264 60 (Fig.\n4). In nearly all of the preferred models, q = 2 or 3, and Nc \u2265 5. The best-fitting model\nparameters are \u03c4V = 40, q = 2, and Nc = 8. For q = 2, a range of Nc from 5 to 10 fits well,\ngenerally with \u03c4V = 40. The best q = 3 models have \u03c4V = 20, with 5 \u2264 Nc \u2264 20. The cloud\ndistribution is compact in these larger q models. Such a small region is consistent with highresolution mid-IR images (Bock et al. 2000; Tomono et al. 2001; Galliano et al. 2005) and\ninterferometry (Jaffe et al. 2004) that show almost no extended emission in the presumed\ntorus mid-plane. For the intrinsic AGN luminosity we find LAGN \u2248 2 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 .\nWe specifically avoided fitting the silicate feature itself, and the resulting models do\nnot reproduce its shape well. The resulting discrepancy is likely due at least in part to\nlimitations of the current models. Also, the theoretical spectra account only for the torus's\nemission, but foreground absorption and contamination from extended sources within the\naperture may alter the observed spectrum.\nFig. 5 shows the models from Fig. 4 along with the broader SED of NGC 1068 compiled\nfrom published results. The models are plotted with the same scaling as in Figure 4 . Most\nof the measurements do not isolate the AGN and instead include a significant contribution\nfrom the larger galaxy. Systematically lower fluxes, which are more similar to the models,\nare observed only at the highest spatial resolution. As already shown in Table 1, much of\nthe observed mid-infrared flux of NGC 1068 is not due to the active nucleus alone, even on\nsub-arcsecond scales.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n1000\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nFlux Density (Jy)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n1\n\n10\n\u03bb (\u03bcm)\n\n100\n\nFig. 5.- Original data and models (as in Fig. 4) compared with data from the literature.\nThe active nucleus alone contributes only a fraction of the total luminosity of NGC 1068\nthat is measured on larger spatial scales.

The silicate feature in the ionization cones\nThe complexity of the MIR emission from the ionization cones is immediately apparent\nfrom Figures 2 and 6, in which neighboring spectra often exhibit significant variations in\nspectral slope and silicate feature profile and depth, at positions both adjacent to and more\ndistant from the center. Smaller differences between the spectra taken at the two epochs\ncan also be seen. We attribute these to the slight differences in seeing and slit positioning\nbetween the two data sets, which therefore do not sample identical regions of the complex\nand structured extended MIR emission.\nProbably the most striking finding is the strong asymmetry in the spatial distribution\nof the silicate \"optical depth\" close to the nucleus (Fig. 6). The largest values of \u03c49.7 occur\n0\u20131\u2032\u2032 south-southwest (SSW) of the central compact source. This finding is consistent with\nobservations of optical and near-IR line and continuum emission (e.g. Macchetto et al. 1994;\nBruhweiler et al. 2001; Thompson et al. 2001), both of which are much fainter to the south\nof the nucleus, suggesting increased extinction to this region. Further support for this interpretation comes from the increase in near-IR polarized flux to the SSW, interpreted as\nadditional scattering in that area (Young et al. 1996; Packham et al. 1997; Simpson et al.\n2002). On the whole, this picture is consistent with the dusty disk of the host galaxy, which\nis inclined at \u223c29\u25e6 (Garc\u0131\u0301a-G\u00f3mez et al. 2002), screening the southern but not the northern\nionization cone, as suggested by a number of authors (e.g. Packham et al. 1997; Bock et al.\n1998; Kraemer & Crenshaw 2000; Young et al. 2001).\nWe emphasize, however, that this conclusion could not have been drawn from \u03c49.7 alone.\nThe complexity revealed by the observations, and the likely clumpiness of the dust (\u00a74.1),\nmake it difficult to extract physical parameters in a meaningful way. The common interpretation in terms of an absorbing screen in front of a background source ignores the screen\nemission, becoming meaningless when optical depths are large. The temperature of an externally heated optically thick dust cloud varies considerably over its surface, and the depth of\nthe absorption feature emerging from its dark side is not a reliable indicator of optical depth\n(Nenkova, Sirocky, Ivezi\u0107 & Elitzur 2005, in preparation). The spectra shown in figures 4\nand 5 were calculated with models in which the clouds' overall optical depth varied from\n160 to 300 at V, yet they produce a feature with \u03c49.7 of only \u223c 0.3. The patchy structure\nfound in both the shape and depth of the silicate feature can be produced by many different\ncombinations of clouds and background continuum. The current observations do not provide\nthe means for a unique interpretation.\nThe profile of the silicate feature off the nucleus, especially to the north, deserves some\ncomment. The spectra display clear signs of absorption but the shape of the feature is quite\ndistinct from that of the typical diffuse ISM absorption band, which commences close to 8 \u03bcm\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- \u03c49.7 as a function of distance from the nucleus in 0.4\u2032\u2032 bins. Positive distances\nare NNE; negative, SSW. The star indicates the value obtained from the total spectrum\nextracted over \u00b13\u2032\u2032 along the 0.4\u2032\u2032 -wide slit.\nand extends to \u223c12.5 \u03bcm (e.g. Kemper et al. 2004; Chiar & Tielens 2005). In Fig. 2, the\nfeature has almost reached the continuum level by \u223c11 \u03bcm in many of the spectra. Spectral\nprofiles similar to those observed from 1.2 - 2.0\u2032\u2032 NNE have also been found in spectra of\nembedded YSOs, and interpreted as a combination of absorption and emission in the line of\nsight (Kessler-Silacci et al. 2005, see for instance IRAS 04295+2251 in their Fig. 1). This\nmay suggest that the spectral shapes observed in the ionization cones of NGC 1068 indicate\ncomponents of both absorption and emission from those regions.\nIn the Gemini data, the overall value of \u03c49.7 (i.e., obtained from the sum of all spectra\nwithin 3\u2032\u2032 ) is 0.35\u00b10.03. This is slightly lower than the values in the nuclear spectra. The\noverall value is also somewhat less than that in the spectrum of Siebenmorgen et al. (2004)\nusing a 3\u2032\u2032 slit of unspecified orientation; employing the same methodology as that used\nfor our silicate absorption depth estimates, we measure \u03c49.7 \u2248 0.45 from their Fig. 14.\nAitken et al. (1984) and Roche et al. (1984) observed NGC 1068 with beam sizes of 4 - 6\u2032\u2032\nand estimated \u03c49.7 \u2248 0.5. Thus there may be a moderate difference in \u03c49.7 between these\nmeasurements and our summed spectrum. This could perhaps be accounted for if stronger\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nsilicate absorption is found in regions outside of the 0.4\u2032\u2032 slit; if, for example, silicate emission\nfrom the ionization cones fills in the absorption feature in the narrow slit.\nThe spatially-resolved mid-IR SED within 1\u2032\u2032 of the mid-IR flux peak was previously\nexamined by Bock et al. (2000) and Galliano et al. (2003) using imaging in four and seven\nnarrow-band filters respectively. While Bock et al. (2000) detected prominent silicate absorption in the core and at a position 0.4\u2032\u2032 south, and little absorption to the north, Galliano\net al. (2003) found silicate absorption increasing with distance from the nucleus to the northeast, with the feature in emission to the southwest. Thus, the behavior of the silicate feature\nhas until now been unclear. The findings of Bock et al. (2000) are in fair agreement with\nFigures 2 and 6. Contrary to Galliano et al. (2003), neither we nor Bock et al. (2000) observe\nsilicate emission at positions south of the nucleus, finding instead that the region within 1\u2032\u2032\nof the nucleus has stronger absorption at the flux peak and to the south than to the north.\nSimilar results have recently been reported by Rhee & Larkin (2005). While the maximum\n\u03c49.7 = 0.42 \u00b10.02 in our epoch 2 data is reached on the nucleus itself, a feature of comparable\ndepth is observed at 0.4 and 0.8\u2032\u2032 SSW of the center in the epoch 1 spectra. The silicate\nfeature strength is fairly uniform at \u03c49.7 \u2248 0.2 \u2212 0.3 in the northern ionization cone, and at\n1.2-2.0\u2032\u2032 SSW of the flux peak, \u03c49.7 in both sets of data falls to similar values to that observed\nto the NNE.\n\n3.2.4. The emission lines.\nThe [Ar III]+[Mg VII], [S IV], and [Ne II] line fluxes measured along the slit are listed\nin Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 7. As can be seen in the figure, although there are some\ndifferences between them, all three are of fairly similar brightness at their peak (to within a\nfactor of two) and fall off rapidly to either side. The figure also shows that the mid-infrared\ncontinuum is considerably more sharply concentrated toward the nucleus than is the line\nemission. None of the fine structure line fluxes peaks at the nucleus.\nRelative to the continuum peak there is a clear offset of 0.2\u2032\u2032 in the centroids of the\nfluxes of all of the fine structure lines relative to the centroid of the continuum. This offset is\nto the north-northeast, and is the direction expected based on the trends in extinction as a\nfunction of position (see \u00a73.2.3). In addition, all three line fluxes peak 0.4\u2032\u2032 NNE of the center.\nCorrecting the measured line fluxes for extinction at each position along the slit based on \u03c49.7\nwould result in more symmetric distributions about the nucleus for all three lines. However,\nvariations in extinction cannot entirely explain the spatial distributions of the relative fluxes\nof the three lines. For example, close to the center the large asymmetry in the [Ne II]\nline flux at 0.4\u2032\u2032 NNE compared to 0.4\u2032\u2032 SSW will be much less extinction-corrected than\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Fluxes in a 0.4\u2032\u2032 x 0.4\u2032\u2032 aperture of three fine structure lines (mean of the two\nepochs) and the 11\u03bcm continuum flux density as a function of offset from the nucleus. A\nrepresentative random error bar (\u00b11\u03c3) is shown for the line fluxes; the uncertainty in the\ncontinuum is negligible.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nthe asymmetries of the other lines, whose wavelengths are closer to the peak of the silicate\nabsorption. Thus other effects such as variable excitation or an asymmetric distribution of\nmaterial must also contribute to the offset between the continuum and emission line peaks.\nThese may be related to narrow line clouds B and/or C (Evans et al. 1991), located about\n0.1-0.4\u2032\u2032 north of the nucleus and suggested to be responsible for the observed bend in the\nradio jet close to that position (Gallimore et al. 1996b; Galliano et al. 2003).\nEvidence for variable excitation is also present further from the nucleus. The [Ne II]\nand [S IV] lines have roughly equal fluxes at their peak, but at distances of 0.4-2\u2032\u2032 SSW\nof the nucleus the [S IV] line is typically 1.5-3 times the strength of each of the other two\nemission features, which have similar spatial distributions. These differences are too large\nto be attributed to the changes in extinction.\nThe extinction explanation is also untenable if the [Ar III] line dominates the flux of the\n9.0 \u03bcm blend because the silicate extinctions at 9.0 \u03bcm and 10.5 \u03bcm are similar. However, the\n[Mg VII] line is expected to contribute significantly to the strength of the 9.0 \u03bcm feature near\nthe nucleus, as lines of many highly excited species are seen toward the nucleus, including a\nstrong 5.50 \u03bcm line of [Mg VII] (Lutz et al. 2000). The change in the ratio of the 9.0 \u03bcm and\n10.5 \u03bcm features can be understood as a consequence of the rapid fall-off of the coronal line\nflux with distance from the nuclear ionizing source and the increased importance of other\nionizing sources such as hot stars. The wavelength of the [Ar III] line (8.991 \u03bcm)is accurately\nknown and the best estimate for the [Mg VII] line wavelength places it within 0.004 \u03bcm of\nthe [Ar III] line (Hayward et al. 1996). Thus it will be difficult for higher spectral resolution\nto separate the contributions of the two lines and indeed the R\u223c1500 spectrum of Lutz et al.\n(2000) does not.\nThe strength of the 9.0 \u03bcm blend near the nucleus, roughly half that of the other two\nlines, also suggests that [Mg VII] (with an ionization potential of 186.5 eV) is a significant\nand probably dominant contributor to this feature. This inference is based on the observation\nthat in starburst galaxies the [Ar III] line is always at least a factor of four weaker than at\nleast one of the other two lines (Verma et al. 2003). That is understandable because (1)\nargon is 30 times less abundant than neon and almost an order of magnitude less abundant\nthan sulfur, (2) the fine structure collision strengths for excitation of the [S IV] and [Ar III]\ntransitions' upper levels are comparable and only several times larger than that for the [Ne II]\nupper level, and (3) the ionization potential of [Ar III] (27.6 eV), is intermediate between\nthose of [Ne II] (21.6 eV) and [S IV] (34.8 eV).\nComparison of the integrated fluxes of the [Ar III]+[Mg VII], [S IV], and [Ne II] lines\nalong the central 6\u2032\u2032 of the 0.4\u2032\u2032 Michelle slit with the fluxes measured in the 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 slit of\nthe ISO SWS (Lutz et al. 2000) demonstrates that the bulk of the emission line flux detected\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nby ISO SWS comes from the central 1-2 arcseconds. The fluxes detected by Michelle are\napproximately 28%, 27%, and 18%, respectively, of those detected by ISO SWS. In their 3\u2032\u2032\nslit, Siebenmorgen et al. (2004) observed 52% of the ISO SWS [S IV] flux. Compared with the\n28% that we detect, this suggests that the [S IV] flux is quite diffuse within the ionization\ncones, as is indeed illustrated by Fig. 7. Both our narrow-slit data and the wider-slit\nmeasurements of Siebenmorgen et al. (2004) recover only .20% of the large-aperture [Ne II]\nflux, consistent with the more centrally-concentrated nature of the nuclear [Ne II] emission\nshown in Fig. 7 and suggesting that the bulk of the [Ne II] flux detected by ISO arises in\nmore distant regions, such as the kpc-scale starburst ring, not covered by these slits.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe M-band spectrum\n\nThe UKIRT/CGS4 R=15000 M-band spectrum of NGC 1068 is shown in Fig. 8. The\nspectrum covers a narrow portion of the M window that contains the redshifted R(0) R(4) lines of the fundamental vibration-rotation band of 12 CO. In absorption the R(0) line\narises from the lowest lying rotational level, the lower state energies of the other transitions\ncorrespond to temperatures of 6 K, 17 K, 33 K, and 55 K above the ground state. In\nLTE at least some of these lines would be among the strongest CO absorption lines for gas\ntemperatures up to several hundred Kelvins. In dense (n>105 cm\u22123 ) clouds CO should be\nin near-LTE at these temperatures. In lower density clouds, because spontaneous emission\nis more rapid than collisional excitation, LTE will not be achieved and most of the CO will\nbe in the lowest one or two rotational levels despite a high gas kinetic temperature (see e.g.\nGeballe et al. 1999; McCall et al. 2002).\nNo CO lines are apparent in Fig. 8. The limit per 20 km/s resolution element is\ntypically 3% of the continuum. Lutz et al. (2004b) have published an upper limit of 7%\nof the continuum for individual lines, based on an R=2500 spectrum obtained using ISOSWS. The much higher resolution spectrum presented here thus provides a considerably\nmore stringent limit, unless the CO lines are several hundred km/s wide.\nAs discussed in \u00a74.2, there are several ways of interpreting this upper limit. Here we\nanalyze it in terms of constraining the properties of a foreground screen, although this is\nsurely a naive interpretation. For such an absorber the limit on the CO column density\nwould depend on the CO excitation temperature and the linewidth. For 50 K and 50 km/s,\nfor example, the UKIRT spectrum implies that the total CO column density is less than\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . Higher temperatures and greater linewidths both increase that upper limit\n(but only by a factor of about two for 100 K and 100 km/s).\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Spectrum of NGC 1068 near 4.66 \u03bcm. The velocity resolution of 20 km/s is\nindicated. The positions of CO lines are shown for the redshift of NGC 1068, z=0.00379.\nIf the CO-containing gas (as well as the associated obscuring dust) is in dense clouds (i.e.,\nclouds into which near-UV radiation cannot penetrate), then almost all of the interstellar\ncarbon is in CO. Assuming that the carbon abundance is roughly solar, one concludes that\nN(H2 ) < 1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . For a standard gas-to dust ratio, the corresponding foreground\nextinction is \u223c0.1 mag. If the obscuring material is entirely in diffuse clouds, then at most\nonly a few percent of the carbon is neutral and the H2 column density and dust extinction\ncan be roughly two orders of magnitude higher.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nClumpiness and complex spectral structure in the ionization cones\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of these data is the variation in the spectra over small\ndistances (Fig. 2). There is significant structure in the dust and gas in the circumnuclear\nregions even on subarcsecond scales: the ionization cones of NGC 1068 are as complex in\nthe mid-IR as at shorter wavelengths. This complexity was hinted at in the narrow-band\nimaging study of Bock et al. (2000) and is evident in the deconvolved 12.8 \u03bcm image of\nGalliano et al. (2005), and is made clearer in the present data.\nAs noted in \u00a73.2.3, the bulk of the mid-IR emission coincident with the ionization cones\nin NGC 1068 is likely to be thermal emission from warm dust. Any arrangement of the\ndust proposed to explain the mid-IR emission and silicate feature, however, must also be\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nconsistent with certain tight observational constraints. First, the reddening of the northern\nionization cone is lower than suggested by the depth of the silicate feature in our spectra. If a\nforeground screen distribution and standard Galactic dust properties (AV /\u03c49.7 \u2248 9 \u2212 19 and\nRV \u2248 3; Roche & Aitken 1984, 1985; Whittet 1992) were assumed, \u03c49.7 = 0.2 would imply\nEB\u2212V \u223c 0.6 \u2212 1.3, already somewhat higher than the mean reddening of the northern cone,\nEB\u2212V \u2248 0.35 (for the more obscured blueshifted line components; Kraemer & Crenshaw\n2000). Moreover, as the spectral profile of the silicate feature in the cones may reflect a\ncombination of both emission and absorption, any determination of EB\u2212V from \u03c49.7 in this\nsimple screen model could easily be an underestimate. Second, the UV/optical polarisation\nmechanism in the central .1\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1068 is thought to be electron scattering (Antonucci\n& Miller 1985; Miller et al. 1991; Antonucci et al. 1994; Young et al. 1995), mainly on the\nbasis of the wavelength-independent polarization spectrum, but the high efficiency for dust\nrelative to electron scattering (e.g. Kishimoto et al. 2001) suggests that light scattered off\nelectrons in the cones should undergo further, wavelength-dependent scattering off any dust\ngrains in or around the cones.\nArranging the dust in optically thick clumps associated with the NLR clouds, in accordance with the good spatial coincidence of the structures emitting in [O III] and at 12.8 \u03bcm\n(Galliano et al. 2005), may circumvent these problems. Gray scattering from such clumps\nmay be able to mimic the wavelength-independent polarization caused by electron scattering\n(Code & Whitney 1995; Kishimoto et al. 2001), and the dust would be likely to survive for\nmuch longer in this kind of configuration (Laor & Draine 1993; Villar-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. 2001). Arranging the dust in clumps could also explain the low reddening of the ionization cones while\npermitting appreciable silicate absorption, as much of the ionized gas would be expected to\nlie outside the clumps, which would only have a small covering factor. In this scenario, any\nemission component in the silicate feature in the cones would result from a view of the hot\nsides and faces of clumps towards the far edge of the cone. The absorption would then arise\nin the cooler surfaces of clumps closer to the near edge of the cone, inclined away from the\ncentral engine, and in a small amount of foreground dust. The presence of dust clumps was\nsuggested by Galliano et al. (2003) to explain SEDs showing silicate emission in the southern\nionization cone (stated to be tilted away from the line of sight and therefore exposing hot\nclump surfaces to our view), at odds with the present data and Bock et al. (2000). However,\nthe southern cone is also thought to be located behind the disk of the galaxy and subject to\nincreased extinction that may well suppress a silicate emission feature from hot clump faces.\nFurther from the nucleus, on the other hand - around and including the \"northeast knot\"\nfirst identified by Miller et al. (1991) - both dust and electron scattering are thought to\ncontribute to the polarization (Miller et al. 1991; Packham et al. 1997; Simpson et al. 2002),\nsuggesting the presence of dust other than in clumps.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nThe nature and distribution of material close to the nucleus\n\nIn fitting both the nuclear 10 \u03bcm spectrum and the broader IR SED, the clumpy torus\nmodels require most of the mid-IR-emitting dust in the torus to exist rather close to the\nnucleus. In the models with q = 3, for example, 90% of the clouds lie within 3 pc of the\nAGN. This is comparable to the dimensions of the warm dust structure detected by Jaffe\net al. (2004) in NGC 1068, and also in agreement with recent imaging data constraining\nthe central IR source to a diameter of a few parsecs or less in several other Seyfert galaxies\n(Swain et al. 2003; Prieto & Meisenheimer 2004; Prieto et al. 2005; Packham et al. 2005).\nOn the other hand, both mid-IR imaging and the torus model predictions imply that\nsubstantial additional mid-IR emission arises outside the central source. This is also apparent\nin the comparison of observational data in different apertures shown in Fig. 5: there is a\nclear trend for subarcsecond-aperture measurements at wavelengths as short as 3 \u03bcm to be\nappreciably lower than larger-aperture ones, even when stellar dilution is taken into account\nin the 3-5 \u03bcm data, as in Alonso-Herrero et al. (2001). It is important to note the wavelength\ndependence of trends among different apertures. In the near-IR, the 1.5\u2032\u2032 measurements of\nAlonso-Herrero et al. (2001) are in good agreement with the high-resolution results of Weigelt\net al. (2004) at both H and K bands. The compact emission is known to dominate at these\nwavelengths, contributing about 80% of the flux in a 2.5 \u00d7 2.5\u2032\u2032 aperture at K (Weigelt\net al. 2004). In the L and M bands, however, the Alonso-Herrero et al. (2001) flux density\nmeasurements exceed the compact source by a large factor, and this difference persists in\nthe Bock et al. (2000) 2\u2032\u2032 -aperture N band measurements. While estimates of the torus\nemission are known to be unreliable in the far-IR because of the large beams involved, even\nground-based mid-IR observations do not usually isolate the AGN contribution.\nThis is also relevant to the interpretation of the non-detection of CO lines in the M\nband spectrum: the M-band imaging of Rouan et al. (2004), for example, implies that the\naperture used for the CO observations contains emission from much material not directly\nassociated with the torus. We therefore first examine the limiting case in which all of the\ngas exists in optically thick clouds much smaller than the beam size - such as the torus\nclouds modeled in \u00a73.2.2 and the NLR clouds proposed in \u00a74.1 - and then go on to consider\nthe constraints the CO non-detection places on the nature and distribution of material both\noutside and inside those clumps.\nIf the only molecular material is in optically thick molecular clouds, the upper limit on\nthe CO lines can be interpreted as constraining the filling factor, \u03c6, of these clouds. The dark\nsides of individual clouds will be strong CO absorbers, so we assume that the absorption\nfrom such clouds removes all the light from the beam at that position. The limit on CO line\nabsorption then implies that the beam filling factor of molecular clouds must be less than\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n0.03, comparable to the \u03c6 \u223c0.1 quoted by Nenkova et al. (2002) as a reasonable realization of\nthe clumpy torus model. On the other hand, if the entire 5 \u03bcm continuum source including\nthe torus clouds is obscured in part by cool foreground material, the implications of the\nnon-detection of CO will depend on the nature of that material. As discussed earlier, in\ndense molecular clouds essentially all of the C is in CO, and the limit on the CO column\ndensity in implies much less than a magnitude of visual foreground extinction. In diffuse\nclouds typically only 1% of the C is in CO, so that the limit can tolerate as much as 5-10\nmags of visual foreground extinction.\nAs noted in \u00a73.2.3, in realistic clumpy dust configurations, however, the relation between\n\u03c49.7 and optical depth is not straightforward. Therefore Fig. 6 may not be appropriate for\nestimating the extinction to the 5 \u03bcm continuum emitting regions. The EB\u2212V of the region\ncovered by the 0.9\u2032\u2032 M band slit has been derived from He II line ratios by Kraemer &\nCrenshaw (2000), who find a mean value of 0.22 to the NNE and values typically >0.3 to\nthe SSW. Using the standard value of RV , this translates to AV \u223c0.7-0.9 or more. This\nis several times greater than the extinction implied by the CO non-detection assuming the\nforeground material to be molecular in nature, but consistent with the presence of diffuse\nclouds.\nThere is further evidence that supports diffuse clouds as the dominant location of the\ndust: the presence of the 3.4 \u03bcm absorption feature in the spectrum of the nucleus of\nNGC 1068 (Wright et al. 1996; Imanishi et al. 1997; Marco & Brooks 2003; Mason et al. 2004).\nThe 3.4 \u03bcm absorption feature is believed to be produced by hydrocarbons in refractory dust\ngrains and has not been detected in dense clouds in the Galaxy, but has been seen in numerous\ndiffuse Galactic clouds. The absence of the feature in dense clouds is thought to be at least\npartly due to the lack of atomic hydrogen available to re-form C\u2013H bonds destroyed by UV\nphotons and cosmic rays (Mu\u00f1oz Caro et al. 2001; Mennella et al. 2003).\nIn the Galaxy the ratio of the total extinction to the optical depth of the 3.4 \u03bcm\nfeature has been measured in a large number of sources (Pendleton et al. 1994; Rawlings\net al. 2003). The value of AV /\u03c43.4 is &250 in diffuse clouds outside of the Galactic center\nand \u223c150 toward the Galactic center (where it is believed that roughly one-third of the\nextinction arises in dense cloud material, making the ratio \u223c100 for diffuse clouds along that\nsightline). In NGC 1068, the optical depth of the 3.4 \u03bcm feature is measured to be about\n0.1-0.15 (Wright et al. 1996; Imanishi et al. 1997; Marco & Brooks 2003; Mason et al. 2004).\nIf the visual extinction derived from the He II lines is applicable to the regions producing the\n5 \u03bcm continuum the ratio is <10, and even if one derives an extinction from \u03c49.7 the ratio\nis \u223c50. Thus, the 3.4 \u03bcm feature is far stronger relative to the foreground visual extinction\nin NGC 1068 than in the Galaxy. These low values suggest that not only the foreground\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nextinction but much of the cloud material, regardless of its location, giving rise to the silicate\nfeature in the central 1\u2032\u2032 is diffuse in terms of its chemistry and abundances.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nN-band near-diffraction-limited observations of the nuclear region of NGC 1068 at the\nGemini North telescope show that the complexity of the nuclear region, previously seen in\nmid-IR imaging and observations at shorter wavelengths, persists in mid-IR spectra. The\nspectra vary widely on spatial scales of less than 1\u2032\u2032 , in the slope of the continuum, the\nstrength of the silicate absorption feature, and the fine structure line fluxes. The optical\ndepth of the silicate feature is observed to vary between about 0.2 and 0.45, and the silicate\nabsorption and all three of the [Ar III]+[Mg VII], [S IV] and [Ne II] fine structure features\nare asymmetrically distributed within 1\u2032\u2032 of the center. The relative strengths of the above\nthree emission features imply a strong contribution by the high excitation [Mg VII] line to\nthe blend of that line and [Ar III].\nA high spectral resolution UKIRT/CGS4 spectrum of the central 1\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1068 shows\nno evidence for absorption by CO. This upper limit implies either a small filling factor for\ndense molecular clouds obscuring the nuclear continuum source(s), a predominance of obscuring diffuse cloud material lacking in CO (whose existence also is implied by the interstellar\n3.4 \u03bcm absorption feature seen towards the nucleus), or a combination of the two.\nThe mid-IR emission from NGC 1068 originates in two distinct components. Emission\nfrom the central region with diameter 0.4\u2032\u2032 is dominated by the IR - bright obscuring torus.\nOur observations place an upper limit of 15 pc on the torus radius, in agreement with the\ncompact (\u223c3 pc) size determined by mid-IR interferometry. We have been able to obtain\ngood fits with the clumpy torus models of Nenkova et al. (2002) to this nuclear region. MidIR emission in apertures larger than \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 is dominated by a second component, the lower\nbrightness, diffuse emission from the AGN-heated dust in the ionization cones. If NGC 1068\nis representative of other sources, the implication is that AGN SEDs are highly uncertain\nsince the torus does not dominate large-aperture photometry at wavelengths longer than the\nnear IR. While this has long been known to be the case for facilities such as ISO and IRAS,\nour results underline the need for future thermal-IR observations of AGN to be obtained at\nthe highest possible spatial resolution even at mid-IR wavelengths.\nWe wish to thank W.
