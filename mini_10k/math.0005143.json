This paper consists of two sections discussing various aspects of commutative and non\u2013commutative geometry of tori and abelian\nvarieties.\nIn the first section, we present a new definition of mirror symmetry for abelian\nvarieties and, more generally, complex and p\u2013adic tori, that is, spaces of the form\nT /B where T is an algebraic group isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups,\nK is a complete normed field, and B \u2282 T (K) is a discrete subgroup of maximal\nrank in it. We also check its compatibility with other definitions discussed in the\nliterature.\nIn the second section, we develop an approach to the quantization of abelian varieties first introduced in [Ma1], namely, via theta functions on non\u2013commutative,\nor quantum, tori endowed with a discrete period lattice. These theta functions\nsatisfy a functional equation which is a generalization of the classical one, in particular, involve a multiplier. Since multipliers cease to be central in the quantum\ncase, one must decide where to put them. In [Ma1] only one\u2013sided multipliers were\nconsidered. As a result, the product of two theta functions in general was not a\ntheta function. Here we suggest a partial remedy to this problem by introducing two\u2013sided multipliers. The resulting space of theta functions possesses partial\nmultiplication and has sufficiently rich functorial properties so that rudiments of\nMumford's theory ([Mu]) can be developed. Main results of [Ma1] are reproduced\nhere in a generalized form, so that this paper can be read independently.\nWe will now briefly describe a broader picture into which this work fits.\n1. On mirror symmetry. In this paper mirror symmetry is understood\nas a binary relation between (weak) Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds endowed with some\nadditional data. A projective (or compact complex) manifold V is a weak Calabi\u2013\nYau, if it admits nowhere vanishing global volume form. Additional data which are\ncommonly considered are of two types.\nA) A symplectic or complexified symplectic structure \u03c9V on V , which is \"sufficiently large\" in the case of complex base field.\nB) A cusp cV in the moduli space (or rather stack) of deformations of V , that\nis, a neighborhood of a point of \"maximal degeneration\" to which V belongs.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe mirror partnership relation between (V, cV , \u03c9V ) and (W, cW , \u03c9W ) consists in\na host of identifications (partly conjectural) of various structures that can be produced starting with such triples. In the case of strict Calabi\u2013Yau's, this includes an\nidentification of two Frobenius manifolds: quantum cohomology of (V, \u03c9V ) and a\ngerm of the extended moduli space of W with its flat structure determined by cW ,\nand similarly with roles of V and W reversed. Generally, one expects also a representation of V and W as dual real Lagrangian torus fibrations over a common base,\nwith a rich structure of Fourier\u2013Mukai transform connecting Lagrangian/complex\nanalytic objects on both sides. For more details on this, see original works [MirS1],\n[MirS2], [StYZ], [Ko], [Giv], [Bar], [LYZ], and a report [Ma3].\nMost important testing ground for all levels of mirror correspondence is furnished\nby toric mirrors introduced and studied by V. Batyrev. In the simplest version,\nthis construction looks as follows (see [Bat]).\nLet T be an n\u2013dimensional algebraic torus, that is an algebraic group which\nis isomorphic to a product of n multiplicative groups Gm . It determines (and\nis functorially determined by any of) the two free abelian groups of rank n: its\ncharacter group MT := Hom (T, Gm ) and its group of one\u2013parametric subgroups\nNT := Hom (Gm , T ). These groups are naturally dual to each other. Denote by T t\nthe dual torus, whose character group is MT t = NT and respectively NT t = MT .\nIn the main text of paper, one of these groups is denoted H and another H t .\nAmong various toric compactifications of T we are interested in those for which\ntheir anticanonical system is ample. Anticanonical divisors on them are n\u2013dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.\nSuch toric compactifications T \u2206 are naturally indexed by reflexive polyhedra \u2206\nin NT \u2297 R. Via standard convex duality, each such polyhedron determines the dual\npolyhedron \u2206t in NT t \u2297 R which is also reflexive. According to Batyrev, families of\nanticanonical hypersurfaces in the respective toric compactifications are expected\nto be mirror partners:\nT \u2206 \u2283 \u2212KT \u2206\n\nt\n\n\u21d0\u21d2 \u2212KT t t \u2282 T \u2206t .\n\u2206\n\n(0.1)\n\nThe relevant maximally degenerate CY's are simply divisors at infinity in these\ntoric compactifications.\nSupplementing (T, \u2206) with additional combinatorial structure, one can generalize this picture to some Calabi\u2013Yau complete intersections.\nThe main goal of the first section of this paper is to provide a new definition\nof mirror symmetry for abelian varieties (and more generally, complex and p\u2013adic\ntori) similar to (0.1). We use a \"multiplicative uniformization\" which goes back to\nJacobi and which represents A as a quotient of n\u2013dimensional algebraic torus T by\n\n\f3\n\na multiplicative discrete lattice B \u2282 T (K). Consider now two dual algebraic tori\nendowed with period lattices which are explicitly identified, that is a diagram of\nthe form:\n(i, it ) : T \u2190 B \u2192 T t .\n(0.2)\nWe will say that pairs (A := T (K)/i(B), it) and (B := T t (K)/it (B), i) are mirror\ndual to each other. Over complex field, we will relate it (resp. i) to a structure\nsimilar to \u03c9V (resp. \u03c9W ) above and compare our mirror relation with that of [Gr1],\n[Gr2], [AP] and [GolLO]. In particular, we will see how this diagram gives rise to\ntwo dual fibrations of the relevant abelian varieties (or complex tori) by mutually\ndual Lagrangian real tori over the same base.\nThe choice of multiplicative uniformization is not unique, and it provides the\nenvironment for a partial compactification of the relevant moduli space and choice\nof a maximally degenerate point at the boundary of moduli space to which A is\nclose, that is, of the relevant cusp of the moduli space. Roughly speaking, at the\nboundary some generators of the period lattice are forced to vanish so that the rank\nof the image of B drops. To make it more precise, we can choose a fan \u03a6 in NT \u2297R,\nconstruct the dual fan \u03a6t and study the moduli space of the refined diagrams\nt\n\n(i, it ) : T \u03a6 (K) \u2190 B \u2192 T \u03a6t (K) .\n\n(0.3)\n\nIn this context, it turns out that the fibers of the dual mirror fibrations lie in\nthe monodromy invariant homology class \u03c4 of middle dimension, as in the strict\nCalabi\u2013Yau case.\n0.3. Commutative and non\u2013commutative tori and theta functions. In\nthe second section of this paper we address the problem of constructing \"quantum\nabelian varieties\". As we already mentioned, what we actually construct is a linear\nspace of quantized theta functions (on a noncommutative torus with a period lattice) endowed with partial multiplication. We regard this semiring as a quantum\ndeformation of the universal multigraded ring \u2295\u0393(L), L \u2208 Pic A, [\u22121]\u2217 (L) \u223c\n= L,\nwhich makes sense for any abelian variety A (or indeed for any projective variety).\nSince the whole construction is algebraic, it can be performed over any complete\nnormed field, for example, p\u2013adic field, and applied to the classical abelian varieties\nas well. Only those p\u2013adic abelian varieties admit a multiplicative uniformization\nwhich have maximally degenerate stable reduction modulo p. This is the definition\nof the p\u2013adic cusp. Diagrams of the type (0.2) make full sense in this context as\nwell, but it admits no straightforward interpretation as anything like symplectic\nform. It would be interesting to investigate the meaning of p\u2013adic B\u2013fields for\nstrict Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.\n\n\f4\n\nWe will now briefly discuss issues of non\u2013commutative geometry involved in our\nconstruction of quantized theta functions. The standard approach is via deformation of classical function rings, and this intuition guided our initial construction in\n[Ma1] and to a certain degree its extension presented in this paper.\nA complementary paradigm, made explicit on many occasions in Connes' papers\nand the book [Co] is the natural appearance of non\u2013commutative rings as objects\nencoding commutative spaces \"with bad geometric properties\", typically quotients\nof commutative spaces by non\u2013separated equivalence relations.\nFor example, in the context of multiplicative uniformization of abelian varieties\nA (C) = T (C)/B, the multiplicative period lattice B can degenerate also by ceasing\nto be discrete, although keeping its rank constant, and in this case it becomes\nnatural to interpret T (C)/i(B) in the realm of non\u2013commutative geometry.\nTo be concrete, consider the case of one\u2013dimensional commutative torus T. Its\nmaximal toric compactification is P1 = Gm \u222a {0} \u222a {\u221e}. Choose B = Z so that\nA = C\u2217 /(q Z ). On the level of diagram (0.3) we can choose here any q \u2208 P1 (C).\nWhen |q| =\n6 0, 1, \u221e, we get an elliptic curve A = Eq fibered by images of real\ntori |z| = const (where z is the coordinate on C\u2217 ) over the circle R/Z log |q|.\nDualizing this fibration, we will get the mirror dual elliptic curve. The points 0, \u221e\nbecome divisors on a modular curve and provide the familiar degeneration picture\nin algebraic geometry. Points where q is a root of unity also become visible in\nalgebraic geometry as cusp points of modular curves of higher levels. However, q\nof infinite order with |q| = 1 are not considered in algebraic geometry at all. One\nway to interprete the space Gm /(q Z ) in this case is to identify it with (one of the\nversions of) the two\u2013dimensional non\u2013commutative torus Tq , whose function ring is\ngenerated by x\u00b11 , y \u00b11 satisfying the commutation relation xy = qyx. See Appendix\nfor an informal explanation of this in the context of noncommutative geometry \u00e0\nla Alain Connes.\nOne remarkable trace of this origin of Tq for q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 , \u03c4 \u2208 R, as a limiting\nelliptic curve is the re\u2013appearance of the modular group SL(2, Z) as a symmetry\ngroup in the non\u2013commutative situation: acting on \u03c4 , it produces Morita equivalent\nfunction rings of Tq 's. See [RiS] for a thorough discussion of this in arbitrary\ndimension.\nWhat I want to stress here, is a somewhat neglected complementary aspect of\nthis picture: namely, that even if the group q Z is discrete, Tq still can be viewed as\na legitimate incarnation of the elliptic curve Eq in the non\u2013commutative world. A\nsystematic treatment of the correspondence between, say, coherent sheaves on Eq\nand modules over Tq remains a problem for future, but see the recent preprint [BEG]\nfor some precise facts about this correspondence, and many interesting suggestions\nare contained in [So].\nThis remark throws some light on the problems left open with our approach to\n\n\f5\n\nquantized theta\u2013functions, for example, that of functional equations corresponding\nto a change of cusp. Some of our non\u2013commutative abelian varieties T (H, \u03b1)/B\nwhere T (H, \u03b1) is a non\u2013commutative torus with quantization parameter \u03b1 (see 2.1)\ncan be understood as a result of taking a quotient of a commutative torus T (H \u2032 , 1)\nof halved rank, by a non\u2013discrete period subgroup with too many generators. This\nmight provide a bridge between our construction and that of Weinstein ([We])\nremaining entirely in the realm of commutative geometry.\nAcknowledgement. I am grateful to D. Orlov for illuminating correspondence on\nAbelian mirrors and comments on the paper [GolLO]. I learned from Y. Soibelman\nthe philosophy of treating boundaries of various moduli spaces as bridges to the\nnon\u2013commutative realm. A. Polishchuk has drawn my attention to the paper [Fu]\nand sent me a copy of it.\n1. Mirror symmetry for complex tori and abelian varieties\n1.1. Toric formalism. Since we will have to work with several different types\nof tori which must be carefully distinguished, we start with some terminological\nconventions.\nLet K be a ground field, H a free abelian group of rank n which we will always\nwrite additively. Algebraic torus T with character group H is the affine spectrum\nof the group ring of H, and H = Hom (T, Gm ). Put H t := Hom (Gm , T ). Groups\nH, H t are connected by the canonical duality map H \u00d7 H t \u2192 Aut Gm = Z.\nAn element h \u2208 H considered as a character of T will be denoted e(h) (e for\nexponential). We have e(h + h\u2032 ) = e(h)e(h\u2032 ).\nIn the next section, we will consider noncommutative algebraic tori as well, for\nwhich the multiplication rule for e(h) is twisted: see (2.3) below.\n1.1.1. Duality of algebraic tori. If T is an algebraic torus with character\ngroup HT , the dual algebraic torus T t has the character group HT t := HTt =\nHom (HT , Z).\n1.1.2. Periods and abstract tori. Let H be the character group of T .\nDenote by B another free abelian group of the same rank n, and by i : B \u2192 T (K)\na homomorphism which we will call \"period map\". Since T (K) = Hom (H, K \u2217 ), to\ngive i is the same as to give a pairing H \u00d7 B \u2192 K \u2217 such that (h, b) is the value of\ne(h) at the point i(b).\nWe will refer to the quotient space T /i(B) as an abstract torus, and to T as its\ncovering algebraic torus. One may imagine T /i(B) simply as a functor of points\non K\u2013algebras R 7\u2192 T (R)/i(B). In the case when K = C and i is an injection\nwith discrete image, T (C)/i(B) is a complex torus, which may admit a structure\nof abelian variety (it is then unique). However, a large part of our elementary\n\n\f6\n\nformalism will not depend on additional assumptions. Thus, as explained in the Introduction, we will be able to include into our mirror picture p\u2013adic tori and abelian\nvarieties, and eventually non\u2013commutative tori viewed as models of T (C)/i(B) in\nnon\u2013commutative geometry.\nIn order not preclude the eventual interpretation of the space A = T /i(B) we\nwill consistently identify A with the triple\n(HA , BA , ( , )A : HA \u00d7 BA \u2192 K \u2217 )\n\n(1.1)\n\nas above.\n1.1.3. Poincar\u00e9 dual abstract tori. By definition, Poincar\u00e9 duality interchanges characters and periods. More precisely, A and Ab are Poincar\u00e9 dual if\nHAb = BA , BAb = HA , (b, h)Ab = (h, b)\u22121\nA for h \u2208 HA , b \u2208 BA .\n\n(1.2)\n\nFor abelian varieties this agrees with the classical definition. Notice however, that\na choice of the covering algebraic torus is an additional structure, and we explicitly\nextend Poincar\u00e9 duality to this context.\n1.1.4. Framed tori. A framing of the abstract torus (1.1) is a map it : BA \u2192\nt\nTA\n(K). A framed abstract torus is a pair (A, it ).\nA framing of the complex torus or abelian variety consists of its representation\nas an abstract torus and framing of that abstract torus.\n1.1.5. Mirror dual framed abstract tori. Two framed abstract tori (A, it )\nand (B, i) are called mirror dual, or mirror partners, if their covering algebraic tori\nare dual, and their periods are explicitly identified. More precisely, the relation of\nmirror partnership is provided by diagrams of the form (0.2). If one thinks about\ni, it in terms of the respective character/period pairings (1.1), the mirror duality is\nprovided by pairings\nt\nHA \u00d7 B A \u2192 K \u2217 , HA\n\u00d7 BA \u2192 K \u2217 .\n\n(1.3)\n\nA framing is called non\u2013degenerate if both kernels of the respective pairing are\ntrivial.\nThis notion of mirror duality is the main definition of this section. We start with\nstudying it for K = C.\n1.2. Complex tori. Assume that i(B) is discrete in T (C). Put\n\u0393 = \u0393Z = \u03c01 (T (C)/i(B), 0) = H1 (A, Z),\n\n\f7\n\n\u0393R = \u0393Z \u2297 R and similarly for \u0393C . If T (C)/i(B) is denoted A, we may write \u0393A ,\n\u0393A,R , etc.\nThe real space \u0393R can be identified with the Lie algebra of A, and the exponential\nmap exp : \u0393R \u2192 A with kernel \u0393Z is the universal covering of A.\n1 d e(h)\nLet H = HA be the character group of T . The map h 7\u2192\ninduces\n2\u03c0i e(h)\ncanonical identification H = H 1 (T (C), Z). Hence we have an exact sequence\nt\n0 \u2192 HA\n\u2192 H1 (A, Z) \u2192 BA \u2192 0\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere the third arrow is induced by i. Similarly, we have for a mirror dual framed\ntorus (B = T t (C)/it (B), i)\n0 \u2192 HA \u2192 H1 (B, Z) \u2192 BA \u2192 0\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere the third arrow is now induced by it .\n1.2.1. Mirror partners as dual real torus fibrations. In this subsection\nwe will show that our definition of mirror partners (A, B) over C naturally fits into\nthe general context of Lagrangian/complex duality: see [AP], [StYZ], [Gr2].\nWe start with a brief description of this context.\nLet (X, \u03c9) be a C \u221e symplectic manifold, endowed with a submersion pX : X \u2192\nU whose fibers are Lagrangian tori. We will fix also a Lagrangian section 0X : U \u2192\nX.\nUsing \u03c9, we can identify the bundle of Lie algebras of the tori p\u22121\nX (u), u \u2208 U,\n\u2217\nwith the cotangent bundle TU . Hence we have a canonical isomorphism X = TU\u2217 /H\nwhere H is a Lagrangian sublattice in TU\u2217 with respect to the lift of \u03c9 which is the\nstandard symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. There exists also a canonical\nflat symmetric connection on TU\u2217 for which H is horizontal.\nThe local system H t = Hom (H, Z) is embedded as a sublattice into TU , and\nwe can define the mirror partner of (pX : X \u2192 U, \u03c9, 0X ) as the toric fibration\nY := TU /H t endowed with the projection to the same base pY : Y \u2192 U and the\nzero section 0Y .\nPassing from X to Y we have lost the symplectic form. To compensate for this\nloss, we have acquired a complex structure J : TY \u2192 TY which can be produced\nfrom (p : X \u2192 U, \u03c9, 0X ) in the following way. The flat connection on TU obtained\nby the dualization from TU\u2217 produces a natural splitting TY = p\u2217Y (TU ) \u2295 p\u2217Y (TU ).\nWith respect to this splitting, J acts as (t1 , t2 ) 7\u2192 (\u2212t2 , t1 ).\nConversely, suppose that we have a complex manifold Y endowed with a fibration\nby real tori Y \u2192 U with zero section, such that the operator of complex structure\n\n\f8\n\nalong the zero section identifies TU with the bundle of Lie algebras of fibers. Then\nwe can consecutively construct the lattice H t \u2282 TU , the dual fibration X := TU\u2217 /H\nand the symplectic form on X coming from the cotangent bundle.\nNow we can return to complex tori.\nPut S 1 = {|z| = 1 | z \u2208 C}. We have the Lie group isomorphism C\u2217 \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 R :\nz 7\u2192 (z/|z|, log |z|). This induces an isomorphism\n(\u03b1, \u03bb) : T (C) \u2192 Hom (H, S 1 ) \u00d7 Hom (H, R).\n\n(1.6)\n\nIf i(B) is discrete of maximal rank which I will assume, then \u03bb \u25e6 i(B) is an additive\nlattice in the real space Hom (H, R). Thus (1.6) produces a real torus fibration of\nT (C) over the base which is as well a real torus of the same dimension:\n0 \u2192 Hom (H, S 1 ) \u2192 T (C)/i(B) \u2192 Hom (H, R)/\u03bb \u25e6 i(B) \u2192 0 .\n\n(1.7)\n\nSimilarly, we have\n0 \u2192 Hom (H t , S 1 ) \u2192 T t (C)/it (B) \u2192 Hom (H t , R)/\u03bbt \u25e6 it (B) \u2192 0\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere \u03bbt is defined for T t in the same way as \u03bb for T . Let us identify linear real\nt\nspaces HR with HR\nin such a way that lattice points \u03bb \u25e6 i(b) and \u03bbt \u25e6 it (b) are\nidentified for all b \u2208 B. Then (1.7) and (1.8) become dual real torus fibrations over\nthe common base.\nThe relevant complex structures in our context come from covering tori. We\nhave to introduce symplectic forms. Let us construct, say, \u03c9A . From (1.8) one sees\nthat A = T (C)/i(B) can be obtained as quotient space of the tangent bundle of the\nbase by a lattice. The tangent bundle (and the lattice) is canonically trivialized,\nt\n, that\nand its fiber is HR . Using the two framings, we have identified HR with HR\nis, tangent bundle with cotangent bundle. The canonical symplectic form on the\ncotangent bundle becomes our \u03c9A . Clearly, fibers of (1.7) are Lagrangian tori. It\nremains to check that \u03c9A determines IB as above, but this is quite straightforward.\n1.2.2. Maximal degeneration point and monodromy. Let us consider now\nthe situation, described by (one half of) the diagram (0.3). More precisely, consider\nthe space of maps of B to a neighbourhood of a point of maximal degeneration in\nsome toric compactification T \u03a6 . Such a point is a zero\u2013dimensional orbit of T , thus\nit corresponds to a maximal cone in \u03a6. Assume for simplicity that it is the simplicial\ncone generated by a basis of H t . This means that we identify H t with Zn , T (C)\nwith (C\u2217 )n , and choose as partial compactification the imbedding (C\u2217 )n \u2282 Cn .\nLet Dr be the r\u2013th coordinate hyperplane in Cn .\nChoosing a basis of B as well, that is, identifying it with Zn , we see that the\nregion of the partially compactified moduli space of multiplicatively uniformized\n\n\f9\n\ncomplex tori that we are interested in can be identified with an open subspace of\nthe matrix space Cn\u00d7n whose columns generate a multiplicative sublattice. The\ndiscriminant locus in this region consists of its intersection with \u222aDrs where Drs\nis the r\u2013th coordinate hyperplane in the s\u2013th copy of Cn times other copies. The\norigin (intersection of all Drs ) is the maximum degeneration point.\nLet q = (qrs ) be a point of the moduli space, Aq the respective torus. Denote by\n\u03b3r \u2208 H1 (Aq , Z) the image of the r\u2013th S 1 in (1.7) with counterclockwise orientation.\nLet Mrs be the monodromy action of a small counterclockwise loop around Drs in\nthe moduli space. All cycles \u03b3r are monodromy invariant. Let \u03b2s be any lift to\nH1 (Aq , Z) of the s\u2013th 1\u2013cycle in the base torus in (1.7). Then Mrs transforms \u03b2s\ninto \u03b2s + \u03b3r and leaves other 1\u2013cycles invariant.\nThus, the homology class \u03c4 of any fiber of (1.7) generates the cyclic group of\ninvariant cycles of middle dimension.\nThis statement holds independently of the choice of the simplicial fan and a\nmaximal degenerating cone in it. In this sense, the choice of a covering torus alone\nencodes essential information about large complex structure.\n1.3. Framings and well\u2013becoming pairs. In this subsection we will compare\nour construction of mirror partners with that of [GolLO]. In that paper, the additional structure on A is a complex\u2013valued 2\u2013form \u03c9 rather than symplectic form\nas above. I will show that this as well can be related to an appropriate framing.\nConsider first a pair of framed complex tori (A, it ) and (B, i) which are mirror\npartners as above. In [GolLO], sec. 10, the authors use decompositions\n\u0393A = \u03931,A \u2295 \u03932,A , \u0393B = \u03931,B \u2295 \u03932,B .\nWe will call such decompositions compatible with our choice of covering tori, if\nt\n\u03931,A = HA\n, \u03931,B = HA as in (1.4), (1.5). Thus compatible decompositions are\nsimply splittings of (1.4) and (1.5). The spaces \u0393A,R , \u0393B,R are endowed respectively\nwith complex structures IA , IB coming from covering tori. Clearly,\nt\nt\n\u0393A,R = HA,R\n\u2295 IA HA,R\n\nso that compatible splittings satisfy the condition 10.3.1 (2) of [GolLO].\nConsider now only A, but equipped with a class \u03c9 \u2208 H 2 (A, C) interpreted as\nan antisymmetric complex\u2013valued form on \u0393A . Assume that the extension of \u03c9\nto \u0393A,R is IA \u2013invariant (see [GolLO], last lines of 1.4 for an explanation of this\ncondition). Assume moreover that there exists a compatible decomposition of \u0393A\nsuch that \u03931,A and \u03932,A are \u03c9\u2013isotropic. This means that (A, \u03c9) is a well\u2013becoming\npair in the sense of [GolLO], 10.3.1. Looking at (1.4), we see that \u03c9 can be uniquely\nreconstructed from its restriction which we also denote \u03c9\nt\n\u03c9 : HA\n\u00d7 BA \u2192 C.\n\n(1.9)\n\n\f10\n\nExponentiating (1.9) we produce a framing it : B \u2192 T t (C) in the form (1.3), that\nis\nt\nt\ne(h)(it (b)) = e2\u03c0i \u03c9(h,b+HA ) , h \u2208 HA\n, b \u2208 B.\n(1.10)\nClearly, it remains the same, if we choose another compatible isotropic splitting.\nMoreover, it does not change if we add to \u03c9 another pairing taking values in 2\u03c0iZ.\nIn this way we get a map from the set of all well\u2013becoming pairs (A, \u03c9) admitting\ncompatible isotropic splittings in the sense of [GolLO] to the set of framed abstract\ntori (A, it ) with non\u2013degenerate framings in our sense.\nWe can now complete the comparison of our definition of mirror duality with\nthat of [GolLO].\n1.3.1. Theorem. Let (A, it ), (B, i) be a mirror dual pair of framed complex\nabstract tori, admitting lifts (A, \u03c9A ), (B, \u03c9B ) to well\u2013becoming pairs. Then (A, \u03c9A ),\n(B, \u03c9B ) are mirror dual in the sense of [GolLO].\nProof. We will compare our setting with that of [GolLO], 10.4 and 10.4.1.\nt\nGroups \u03931 , \u03932 in [GolLO] are our HA\n, B, fundamental group of the mirror dual\nt\ntorus is \u03931 \u2295 \u03932 . This means that the real covering torus of their B is the same as\nours, that is T t . It remains to compare the complex structures. In our case it is\nsimply induced from T t (C). In [GolLO] it is described with the help of the complex\nstructure operator I acting upon (\u0393t1 \u2295 \u03932 ) \u2297 R produced from \u03c9 in two steps: via\nformula (14) and subsequent projection described in 10.4.\nIn order to check that they coincide, we will reproduce a part of the argument in\n[GolLO] in the form which hopefully clarifies the meaning of their crucial formula\n(14).\nSince the following construction must be considered in two different situations,\ndescribed in [GolLO] 9.2 and 10.4 respectively, we slightly change the scope of our\nnotation. From now on, \u03931 , \u03932 will denote two abstract free abelian groups of the\nsame finite rank, \u0393 = \u03931 \u2295 \u03932 , \u0393\u2032 = \u0393t1 \u2295 \u03932 . Introduce two real tori\nC = (\u03931 \u2295 \u03932 )R /\u03931 \u2295 \u03932 , C \u2032 = (\u0393t1 \u2295 \u03932 )R /\u0393t1 \u2295 \u03932 .\n\n(1.11)\n\nConsider the data of two types.\n(i) Complex structures on C \u2032 described by the operators I on (\u0393t1 \u2295 \u03932 )R such\nthat their crossover components\nI12 : \u03932,R \u2192 \u0393t1,R , I21 : \u0393t1,R \u2192 \u03932,R\nare bijective.\n(ii) Forms \u03c9 \u2208 \u22272 \u0393tC for which \u03931,C and \u03932,C are maximal isotropic.\n\n\f11\n\nWe will establish a bijection between them in the following way.\nLet us start with a complex structure I in C \u2032 . It determines (and is determined\nby) the space of invariant holomorphic 1\u2013forms on C \u2032 . Integrating them over \u0393t1 \u2282\nH1 (C \u2032 , Z), we will get all additive maps \u0393t1 \u2192 C, in particular, all elements of \u03931 . So\nwe have an embedding \u03931 \u2192 H 0 (C \u2032 , \u03a91 ) : \u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3 such that for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393t1 , \u03b3 \u2208 \u03931 ,\n(\u03b2, \u03b3) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd\u03b3 .\n\n(1.12)\n\n\u03b2\n\nThis allows one to define a non\u2013degenerate scalar product h , i : \u03932 \u2297 \u03931 \u2192 C:\nZ\nh\u03b32 , \u03b31 i =\n\u03bd\u03b31 .\n(1.13)\n\u03b32\n\nFinally, we can extend it to a complex skew\u2013symmetric form \u03c9 on \u0393 declaring \u03931\nand \u03932 to be isotropic:\n\u03c9((\u03b31 , \u03b32 ), (\u03b31\u2032 , \u03b32\u2032 )) = h\u03b32 , \u03b31\u2032 i \u2212 h\u03b32\u2032 , \u03b31 i.\n\n(1.14)\n\nIf we choose a basis of \u0393t1 , \u03932 and a basis of holomorphic 1\u2013forms whose period\nmatrix over \u0393t1 is the identity E, then the Gram matrix of the pairing h , i will be\njust the second half of the total period matrix. Let us denote it \u03c4 . Then e2\u03c0i \u03c4\nis the matrix generating the multiplicative period lattice in the covering complex\ntorus \u0393\u2032C /\u0393t1 which in view of (1.14) agrees with (1.10).\nArguing now in reverse direction, we will show that knowing \u03c4 we can reconstruct\nthe operator I in the same basis and get essentially the [GolLO] formula. In fact, I\n\u2032\nis uniquelyRdetermined\nR by the requirement that for all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and all holomorphic\n\u03bd we have I\u03b3 \u03bd = i \u03b3 \u03bd. Hence to find I we must solve the matrix system\n(Re \u03c4 + i Im \u03c4, E)\nwhich gives\n\u0012\nX\nI=\nU\n\nY\nV\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nX\nU\n\nY\nV\n\n\u0013\n\n= (\u2212Im \u03c4 + iRe \u03c4, iE)\n\n(Im \u03c4 )\u22121 Re \u03c4\n\u2212Im \u03c4 \u2212 Re \u03c4 (Im \u03c4 )\u22121 Re \u03c4\n\n(Im \u03c4 )\u22121\n\u2212Re \u03c4 (Im \u03c4 )\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n(1.15)\n\nFor the first application of (1.15), let us choose a real torus A with period lattice\n\u0393A and put C = A \u2295 Ab where Ab is the Poincar\u00e9 dual real torus, that is \u0393Ab = \u0393tA\n(this does not contradict our multiplicative description (1.2) although it may not\nbe immediately obvious). Put \u03931 = \u0393A , \u03932 = \u0393tA . Comparing our formula (1.15)\n\n\f12\n\nwith [GolLO] (14) in this situation, we see that our I coincides with their I\u03c9 . In\n[GolLO], 8.4, A additionally possesses a complex structure, which produces the\nb C and C \u2032 , say, J. Moreover, \u03c9 is restricted to\ncanonical complex structures on A,\nlie in the complexified N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group, and as a result I commutes with the\ninherited complex structure J on C \u2032 .\nThe setup which we are discussing in the Theorem 1.3.1 is that of [GolLO] 10.4\nand 10.5. The relevant torus C is now A, and its homology lattice is now split by\nthe choice of a compatible decomposition like in 1.3. Extension of this splitting to\nA \u2295 Ab produces the period matrix \u03c4 which is block diagonal and consists of two\nblocks. Formula (1.15) is still valid for the mirror complex structure, when one\nreplaces \u03c4 in it by the respective block. Putting everything together we see that\nour complex structure determined essentially by (1.10) indeed agrees with that of\n[GolLO].\n1.3.2. Remark. [GolLO] contains several tentative descriptions of mirror dual\npairs differing mostly by the exact choice of the additional structure that should\nbe added to A. Our Theorem 1.3.1 together with the Theorem 10.5 in [GolLO]\nindicates that the notion of a well\u2013becoming pair endowed with a choice of one half\nof an isotropic decomposition captures just right amount of information. Replacing\nthis structure by that of framing, we make explicit the important aspect of \"large\ncomplex structure\" in the case K = C and simultaneously extend the definition to\nabstract tori over arbitrary fields.\n2. Quantized theta\u2013functions and abelian varieties.\n2.1. Category of non\u2013commutative tori. Let H be a free abelian group of\nfinite rank and \u03b1 : H \u00d7 H \u2192 K \u2217 an alternating pairing: for all h, g \u2208 H\n\u03b1(h, g) = \u03b1(g, h)\u22121 ,\n\n\u03b1(h1 + h2 , g) = \u03b1(h1 , g)\u03b1(h2 , g).\n\n(2.1)\n\nA morphism f : (H1 , \u03b11 ) \u2192 (H2 , \u03b12 ) is a group homomorphism f : H1 \u2192 H2 such\nthat for all h, g \u2208 H1 we have\n\u03b122 (f (h), f (g)) = \u03b121 (h, g).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe bilinear form\n\u03b5f (h, g) := \u03b11 (h, g)\u03b1\u22121\n2 (f (h), f (g))\nwith values in {\u00b11} is called the characteristic of f (and of F ).\nAny such pair (H, \u03b1) will be called the character group of the non\u2013commutative\ntorus T (H, \u03b1) whose ring of algebraic functions Al(H, \u03b1) is the linear space spanned\nover K by the symbols e(h), h \u2208 H, with multiplication rule\ne(h)e(h\u2032 ) = \u03b1(h, h\u2032 ) e(h + h\u2032 ).\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f13\n\nWe may write eH,\u03b1 (h) for e(h) if need be.\nNotice that \u03b5(h) := \u03b1(h, h) is a character of H taking values \u00b11, and that from\n(2.3) we get the following formulas:\ne(h1 )e(h2 )e(h3 ) = \u03b1(h1 , h2 ) \u03b1(h1 , h3 ) \u03b1(h2 , h3 ) e(h1 + h2 + h3 ),\n\n(2.4)\n\ne(h)\u22121 = \u03b5(h) e(\u2212h).\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe can also consider the two-sided Al (H, \u03b1)\u2013module\nof formal functions Af (H, \u03b1)\nP\nconsisting of infinite linear combinations\nh ah e(h), ah \u2208 K, and, in the case\nof a complete normed field K and an unitary quantization parameter \u03b1 (that is,\n|\u03b1| = 1) the ring of analytic functions An (H, \u03b1) consisting of those formal functions\nfor which |ah | khkN \u2192 0 for any N as khk \u2192 \u221e, khk being any Euclidean norm on\nH.\nThe form \u03b1 can be called the quantization parameter. When \u03b1 \u2261 1, we get the\nusual notions of commutative geometry, so that T (H, 1) is the algebraic torus with\ncharacter group H.\nA morphism F : T (H, \u03b1) \u2192 T (H \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ), by definition, is given by the contravariant K\u2013algebra homomorphism F \u2217 : Al (H \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) \u2192 Al (H, \u03b1).\n2.1.1. Proposition. a) The set of invertible elements of Al (H, \u03b1) is {a e(h) | a \u2208\nK , h \u2208 H}. If F : T (H2 , \u03b12 ) \u2192 T (H1 , \u03b11 ) is a morphism of non\u2013commutative\ntori, then the induced map f = [F ] : H1 \u2192 H2 determined by F \u2217 (e(h)) =\nah e(f (h)), ah \u2208 K \u2217 , is additive and satisfies (2.2) and thus is a morphism of character groups.\nb) The set of all morphisms F with fixed f = [F ] is either empty, or has a\nnatural structure of the principal homogeneous space over the group T (H1 , 1)(K) =\nHom (H1 , K \u2217 ). In particular, if the characteristic of f is 1, then F \u2217 : e(h) 7\u2192\ne(f (h)) extends to a uniquely defined morphism of rings of algebraic functions.\nP\nP\nc) Any morphism F \u2217 extends to Af by F \u2217 ( ah e(h)) =\nah F \u2217 (e(h)). If K is\nnormed and \u03b1 unitary, then this extension maps analytic functions to analytic.\n\u2217\n\nProof. The first statement follows from the fact that H can be endowed with\nthe structure of a well\u2013ordered group. For any such structure, the highest (resp.\nlowest) terms of a product are products of the highest (resp. lowest) terms, so that\nan invertible element coincides with its highest and lowest term.\nTo prove the second statement, rewrite the equality\nF \u2217 (e(h) e(g)) = F \u2217 (e(h)) F \u2217 (e(g))\nusing (2.3). Comparing the e\u2013terms, we see that f (h+g) = f (h)+f (g). Comparing\nthe coefficients, we get\n\u22121\nah ag a\u22121\nh+g = \u03b11 (h, g)\u03b12 (f (h), f (g)).\n\n(2.6)\n\n\f14\n\nThe left hand side is a symmetric form in h, g, whereas the right hand side is\nalternate. Therefore this form takes values {\u00b11}. Hence (2.2) holds, and (2.6) is\nthe characteristic \u03b5f (h, g) of f .\nFinally, let f be a morphism of character groups with characteristic \u03b5. Then ring\nmorphisms F \u2217 with [F ] = f bijectively correspond to the solutions {ah | h \u2208 H1 } of\nthe equations ah ag a\u22121\nh+g = \u03b5f (h, g). If one such solution exists, then all others are\nof the form ah c(h) where c : H1 \u2192 K \u2217 is an arbitrary homomorphism.\nThe remaining statements are straightforward.\n2.1.2. Direct product. By definition, the ring of algebraic functions of\nT (H1 , \u03b11 ) \u00d7 T (H2 , \u03b12 ) is the tensor product of the respective rings. We can write\nT (H1 , \u03b11 ) \u00d7 T (H2 , \u03b12 ) = T (H1 \u2295 H2 , \u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12 )\nby identifying\neH1 ,\u03b11 (h1 ) \u2297 eH2 ,\u03b12 (h2 ) = eH1 \u2295H2 ,\u03b11 \u2295\u03b12 ((h1 , h2 )).\n2.1.3. Some standard morphisms. (i) Shifts. Any point b \u2208 T (H, 1)(K) =\nHom (H, K \u2217 ) determines an automorphism b\u2217 of T (H, \u03b1):\nb\u2217 (e(h)) := h(b)e(h),\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere from now on we denote by h(b) the value of eH,1 (h) at the point b.\n(ii) Multiplication by n. This is the morphism\n2\n\n[n] : T (H, \u03b1) \u2192 T (H, \u03b1n )\ndefined by\n[n]\u2217 (eH,\u03b1n2 (h)) = eH,\u03b1 (nh).\n\n(2.8)\n\nFor n = \u22121 it is an endomorphism of T (H, \u03b1). It is also an endomorphism, if \u03b1\ntakes values in roots of unity of degree d and n2 \u2261 1 mod d.\nThe commutation rule with shifts is\nb\u2217 \u25e6 [n]\u2217 = [n]\u2217 \u25e6 (nb)\u2217 .\n(iii) External multiplication. It is the morphism\nm\u03b1,\u03b2 : T (H, \u03b1) \u00d7 T (H, \u03b2) \u2192 T (H, \u03b1\u03b2)\n\n(2.9)\n\n\f15\n\ndefined by\nm\u2217\u03b1,\u03b2 (eH,\u03b1\u03b2 (h)) = eH,\u03b1 (h) \u2297 eH,\u03b2 (h).\n\n(2.10)\n\n(iv) Mumford's morphism. This is the morphism\nM : T (H \u2295 H, \u03b1 \u2295 \u03b1) \u2192 T (H \u2295 H, \u03b12 \u2295 \u03b12 ),\nM \u2217 (e(h, g)) = e(h + g, h \u2212 g).\n\n(2.11)\n\nIt is well defined, because\n(\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b1)[(h + g, h \u2212 g), (h\u2032 + g \u2032 , h\u2032 \u2212 g \u2032 )]\n= \u03b1(h + g, h\u2032 + g \u2032 )\u03b1(h \u2212 g, h\u2032 \u2212 g \u2032 ) = \u03b12 (h, h\u2032 )\u03b12 (g, g \u2032).\n2.2. Periods. We choose and fix an abelian group of periods B \u2282 T (H, 1)(K).\nThe period group is written additively; it acts upon T (H, \u03b1) by shifts.\nTrying to make sense of the quotient T (H, \u03b1)/B we will study formal or analytic\nfunctions on T (H, \u03b1) with automorphic properties with respect to the the group\n{b\u2217 | b \u2208 B}.\n2.3. Definition. A (two\u2013sided) theta multiplier L for the non\u2013commutative\ntorus T (H, \u03b1) and period group B consists of the data L = (hl , hr , \u03c8, ( , )) where\n(i) hl , hr : B \u2192 H are two group homomorphisms.\nWe also put h\u00b1 := hl \u00b1 hr and denote the image of b \u2208 B with respect to hl\n(resp. hr , h\u00b1 ) as hb,l (resp. hb,r , h\u00b1\nb ).\n(ii) \u03c8 : B \u2192 K \u2217 is also a group homomorphism.\n(iii) ( , ) : B \u00d7 B \u2192 K \u2217 is a symmetric pairing.\nThese data must satisfy the following condition: for all b1 , b2 \u2208 B\n2\n\u22121\nh\u2212\n.\nb2 (b1 ) = (b1 , b2 ) \u03b1(hb1 ,l , hb2 ,l ) \u03b1(hb1 ,r , hb2 ,r )\n\n(2.12)\n\n2.3.1. Remark. Moduli space of quotients T (H, \u03b1)/B locally splits into a\nproduct of the classical moduli space of commutative tori T (H, 1)/B and the space\nof quantization parameters \u03b1 (which in a sense also are \"hidden periods\": cf. our\ndiscussion of Connes' treatment of bad equivalence relations).\nWhen K = C, existence of sufficiently many theta functions is equivalent to the\nalgebraicity of T (H, 1)/B which becomes an abelian manifold. Multipliers of such\ntheta functions satisfy Riemann symmetry and positivity conditions.\n\n\f16\n\nRelations (2.12) represent an extension of the symmetry conditions to our enlarged moduli space. For a quantum version of positivity conditions, see Theorem\n2.6.1 b) below.\n2.4. Automorphy factors. For any theta multiplier L and period b \u2208 B, the\nautomorphy factor jL (b) is, by definition, the following linear endomorphism of any\nof the function spaces Al, Af, An of T (H, \u03b1):\njL (b) : \u03a6 7\u2192 \u03c8(b) (b, b) e(hb,l) \u03a6 e(hb,r )\u22121 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nClearly, it is invertible.\n2.5. Proposition. For L fixed, the map b 7\u2192 jL (b)\u22121 \u25e6 b\u2217 is a group homomorphism.\nIt is injective if Ker h\u2212 = 0.\nProof. We must check that\njL (b1 + b2 )\u22121 \u25e6 (b1 + b2 )\u2217 = jL (b1 )\u22121 \u25e6 b\u22171 \u25e6 jL (b2 )\u22121 \u25e6 b\u22172 .\n\n(2.14)\n\nWe have in view of (2.13), (2.4), (2.5):\n\u2212\njL (b)\u22121 (e(h)) = \u03c8(b)\u22121 (b, b)\u22121 \u03b5(hb,l )\u03b1(h, h+\nb )\u03b1(hb,r , hb,l ) e(h \u2212 hb ).\n\n(2.15)\n\nNow apply both sides of (2.14) to the arbitrary e(h) and then compare them using\n(2.12). A somewhat lengthy but straightforward calculation gives (2.14).\n\u22121\n\u25e6 b\u2217 (e(h)) 6= e(h).\nWhen h\u2212 is injective, h\u2212\nb 6= 0 for non\u2013zero b, so that jL (b)\n\n2.6. Theta functions and theta types. A (quantized) theta function with\nmultiplier L is a formal series \u03b8 \u2208 Af (T (H, \u03b1)) invariant with respect to the transformation group\n{jL (b)\u22121 \u25e6 b\u2217 | b \u2208 B}.\nIn other words, \u03b8 must satisfy the functional equations\nb\u2217 (\u03b8) = \u03c8(b) (b, b) e(hb,l) \u03b8 e(hb,r )\u22121\n\n(2.16)\n\nfor all b \u2208 B. Clearly, theta functions with multiplier L form a linear space which\nwe denote \u0393(L). This notation is supposed to remind the case of usual abelian\nvarieties where we deal with invertible sheaves and their sections.\nActually, different multipliers may produce the same space of theta functions\nor even homomorphisms b 7\u2192 jL (b)\u22121 \u25e6 b\u2217 . Consider, for example, the case of\na commutative torus, where \u03b1 \u2261 1. Then \u0393(L) depends on hl , hr only via their\n\n\f17\n\ndifference h\u2212 = hl \u2212 hr . Moreover, if ( , )\u2032 is another symmetric pairing such that\n\u03c6(b1 , b2 ) := (b1 , b2 )\u2032 (b1 , b2 )\u22121 takes values in {\u00b11}, then \u03c6(b, b) is multiplicative in\nb, and we may replace (\u03c8, ( , )) by (\u03c8 \u2032 , ( , )\u2032 ) where \u03c8 \u2032 (b) = \u03c6(b, b)\u03c8(b).\nGenerally, from (2.15) one sees that if jL\u2032 (b)\u22121 \u25e6 b\u2217 = jL (b)\u22121 \u25e6 b\u2217 for all b, then\n\u2212\nh = h\u2032\u2212 and moreover,\n(b, b)\u22121 \u03b1(hb,r , hb,l ) = \u00b1(b, b)\u2032\u22121 \u03b1(h\u2032b,r , h\u2032b,l ),\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u03c8(b)\u22121 \u03b1(h, h+\n\u03b1(h, h\u2032+\nb ) = \u00b1\u03c8 (b)\nb ).\n\nWe will call two multipliers equivalent, if they have the same space of theta\u2013\nfunctions. (This definition is reasonable only for ample multipliers, see below).\nAn equivalence class of multipliers L will be called a theta type. The space \u0393(L)\ndepends only on this class and can be denoted also \u0393(L).\n2.6.1. Theorem. a) We have\ndim \u0393(L) = [H : h\u2212 (B)].\n\n(2.17)\n\nb) Assume that K is a normed field. Then all theta functions of type L are analytic\nif [H : h\u2212 (B)] < \u221e and\nlog |(b, b) \u03b1(hb,l, \u2212hb,r )|\n(2.18)\nis a positively defined quadratic form on B.\nIn particular, assume that B is free and the quantization parameter \u03b1 is unitary, |\u03b1(h, h\u2032 )| \u2261 1. Then this condition means that rk B = rk H, B is discrete in\nT (H, 1)(K) and log |(b, b)| is positively defined.\nP\nProof. Let \u03b8 = h\u2208H ah e(h), ah \u2208 K, b \u2208 B. We have\nb\u2217 (\u03b8) =\n\nX\n\nah h(b)e(h) =\n\nh\u2208H\n\nX\n\n\u2212\nah+h\u2212 (h + h\u2212\nb )(b) e(h + hb ),\nb\n\n(2.19)\n\nh\u2208H\n\nwhereas the right hand side of (2.16) is:\n\u03c8(b)(b, b)\n\nX\n\n\u2212\nah \u03b5(hb,r ) \u03b1(hb,r , hb,i ) \u03b1(h+\nb , h) e(h + hb ).\n\n(2.20)\n\nh\u2208H\n2\nIn (2.19) we replace h\u2212\nb (b) by (b, b) \u03b5(hb,l )\u03b5(hb,r ) (see (2.12)). Comparing coefficients of (2.19) and (2.20), we see that (2.16) is equivalent to\n\nah+h\u2212 = ah \u03c8(b) h(b)\u22121 (b, b)\u22121 \u03b5(hb,l ) \u03b1(hb,r , hb,l ) \u03b1(h+\nb , h)\nb\n\n(2.21)\n\n\f18\n\nfor all h \u2208 H and b \u2208 B. Thus one can arbitrarily choose values ah for all h in\na system of representatives of H/h\u2212 (B) and then uniquely reconstruct \u03b8. This\nproves the first statement of the theorem. It also shows that if \u0393(L) is not finite\ndimensional, it necessarily contains non\u2013analytic functions.\nAssume now that \u0393(L) is finite dimensional. Then on each coset h + h\u2212 (B) we\nhave\nlog |ah+h\u2212 | = log |ah | \u2212 log |(b, b) \u03b1(hb,r , hb,l )| + log |\u03c8(b) h(b)\u22121 \u03b1(h+\nb , h)|.\nb\n\nThe second summand in the right hand side is quadratic in b whereas the third is\nlinear. Hence analyticity follows from the positive definiteness of (2.18).\n2.6.2. Multiplication of theta functions. Generally, we can multiply analytic functions, but not formal ones. We will call a theta multiplier L analytic, if\n\u0393(L) consists of analytic functions, and ample, if L satisfies conditions of Theorem\n2.6.1 b).\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nWe will call two analytic theta multipliers Li = (hl , hr , \u03c8i , ( , )i), i = 1, 2,\n(1)\n(2)\ncomposable (in this order) if hl = hr . Define their product as\n(1)\n\nL1 \u2297 L2 = L := (hl , h(2)\nr , \u03c81 \u03c82 , ( , )1 ( , )2 ).\nA straightforward calculation shows that if Li are ample, L is ample as well, and\nthe product of theta functions produces a well defined map\n\u0393(L1 ) \u2297 \u0393(L2 ) \u2192 \u0393(L) : \u03b81 \u2297 \u03b82 7\u2192 \u03b81 \u03b82 .\n\n(2.22)\n\nOne can call two ample theta types L1 composable, if they contain pairs of\ncomposable multipliers. The multiplication in (2.22) does not depend on the choice\nof such a pair, but I did not check that the product type L cannot change.\n2.6.3. Quantized abelian varieties. Assume that (T (H, \u03b1), B) admits ample\ntheta multipliers. Then we consider \u2295L \u0393(L) where L runs over all theta types with\n\u03c8(b) \u2208 {\u00b11}, together with partial multiplication defined above, as a quantized\nversion of the graded coordinate ring of an abelian variety. In the classical case,\nit is graded by the symmetric elements of Pic lying in the effective cone (see 2.7.2\nbelow).\n2.7. Functorial properties of theta functions. Consider a morphism of\nnon\u2013commutative tori F : T (H2 , \u03b12 ) \u2192 T (H1 , \u03b11 ). As in Proposition 2.1.1 , let\nF \u2217 (e(h)) = ah e(f (h)), ah \u2208 K \u2217 , f : H1 \u2192 H2 . The map f induces a morphism\nof commutative tori which we also denote F : T (H2 , 1) \u2192 T (H1 , 1). Let Bi \u2282\nT (Hi , 1)(K) be two period lattices such that F (B2 ) \u2282 B1 .\n\n\f19\n\nChoose a theta multiplier L1 = (hl , hr , \u03c8, ( , )) for T (H1 , \u03b11 ) and B1 . We will\nshow, how to produce from it a new theta multiplier\nL2 = F \u2217 (L1 ) = (h\u2032l , h\u2032r , \u03c8 \u2032 , ( , )\u2032 )\nfor T (H2 , \u03b12 ), B2 , if the following condition holds:\nthe characteristic of F is 1, that is, ah+g = ah ag (cf. end of the proof of Proposition 2.2.1), and f is compatible with \u03b11 and \u03b12 , and not just their squares.\nThe map f : H1 \u2192 H2 induces a map F : Hom (H2 , K \u2217 ) \u2192 Hom (H1 , K \u2217 ) whose\nrestriction on B2 sends it to B1 . Put for b, b1 , b2 \u2208 B2 :\nh\u2032l,r = f \u25e6 hl,r \u25e6 F : B2 \u2192 H2 ,\n\n(2.23)\n\nso that h\u2032b,l = f (hF (b),l ) and similarly for h\u2032r , h\u2032\u00b1 ,\n\u03c8 \u2032 (b) = \u03c8(F (b)) ah\u2212 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\n(b1 , b2 )\u2032 = (F (b1 ), F (b2 )).\n\n(2.25)\n\nF(b)\n\n2.7.1. Theorem. The data (2.23)\u2013(2.25) constitute a theta multiplier for T (H2 , \u03b12 ),\nB2 such that F \u2217 (\u0393(L)) \u2282 \u0393(F \u2217 (L)).\nProof. We have first to check that (2.12) holds for F \u2217 (L). For b1 , b2 \u2208 B2 , the\nleft hand side becomes\n\u2212\n\u2212\nh\u2032\u2212\nb2 (b1 ) = f (hF (b2 ) )(b1 ) = hF (b2 ) (F (b1 )).\n\nFurthermore, if the characteristic of F is 1, the right hand side can be rewritten as\n(b1 , b2 )\u20322 \u03b12 (f (hF (b1 ),l ), f (hF (b2 ),l ))\u03b12 (f (hF (b1 ),r ), f (hF (b2 ),r ))\u22121\n= (F (b1 ), F (b2 ))2 \u03b11 (hF (b1 ),l , hF (b2 ),l )\u03b11 (hF (b1 ),r , hF (b2 ),r )\u22121 .\nApplying (2.12) to F (b1 ), F (b2 ) in lieu of b1 , b2 , we see that both expressions coincide.\nLet us now check that F \u2217 (\u0393(L)) \u2282 \u0393(F \u2217 (L)).\nChoose a formal function\n\u03b8=\n\nX\n\nh\u2208H1\n\nch e(h), e = eH1 ,\u03b11 .\n\n\f20\n\nAccording to (2.21), it belongs to \u0393(L) iff the following conditions are satisfied for\nall h \u2208 H1 , b \u2208 B1 :\nch+h\u2212 = ch \u03c8(b) h(b)\u22121(b, b)\u22121 \u03b51 (hb,l ) \u03b11 (hb,r , hb,l ) \u03b11 (h+\nb , h).\nb\n\n(2.26)\n\nNotice that our notation slightly differs from (2.21): ah is now reserved for F \u2217 (e(h)) =\nah e(f (h)) as in the first lines of 2.7.\nPut now\nX\nF \u2217 (\u03b8) =\nCg e(g), e = eH2 ,\u03b12 .\ng\u2208H2\n\nWe have Cg = 0, if g \u2208\n/ f (H1 ); otherwise\nX\nCg =\n\nch ah .\n\n(2.27)\n\nh\u2208f \u22121 (g)\n\nTo prove that F \u2217 (\u03b8) \u2208 \u0393(F \u2217 (L)), we will check that Cg satisfy analogs of relations\n(2.26) written for all g \u2208 H2 and all b \u2208 B2 .\nConsider first the case g \u2208\n/ f (H1 ). Then the relevant analog of (2.26) says that\nCg+h\u2032\u2212 must be proportional to Cg that is, zero. This is indeed true, because in\nb\n\n\u2032\u2212\n\u2212\n/ f (H1 ).\nview of (2.23), h\u2032\u2212\nb = f (hF (b) ) and thus g + hb \u2208\n\nNow assume that g \u2208 f (H1 ), fix also b \u2208 B2 , and write down separately both\nsides of the relevant case of (2.26). Since characteristic of F is 1, the left hand side\ncan be written as\nX\nch+h\u2212 ah ah\u2212\nCg+h\u2032\u2212 =\nb\n\nF (b)\n\nh\u2208f \u22121 (g)\n\n=\n\nX\n\nch ah \u03c8(F (b))ah\u2212\n\nF (b)\n\nh\u2208f \u22121 (g)\n\nF (b)\n\nh(F (b))\u22121 (F (b), F (b))\u22121\n\n\u00d7\u03b51 (hF (b),l ) \u03b11 (hF (b),r , hF (b),l ) \u03b11 (h+\nF (b) , h).\nHere we have rewritten ch+h\u2212\n\nF (b)\n\n(2.28)\n\nusing (2.26).\n\nThe right hand side is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n\u2032\u2212\n\u2032\u2212\n\u2032+\n\uf8ed\nch ah \uf8f8 \u03c8 \u2032 (b) g(b)\u22121(F (b), F (b))\u22121 \u03b52 (h\u2032\u2212\nb,l ) \u03b12 (hb,r , hb,l ) \u03b12 (hb , g).\nh\u2208f \u22121 (g)\n\n(2.29)\nWe can now compare (2.28) and (2.29) term by term using (2.23)\u2013(2.25), and\nconvince ourselves that they coincide. In particular, we use the identities g(b) =\nh(F (b)) and g = f (h) for any h \u2208 f \u22121 (g).\n\n\f21\n\n2.7.2. Examples. All morphisms of tori described in 2.1.3 have characteristic\n1. Therefore, complementing these tori by compatible period lattices, we obtain\nquantized versions of many standard morphisms of abelian varieties.\nIn particular, [\u22121]\u2217 acts on theta multipliers for T (H, \u03b1), B by simply inverting\n\u03c8. Hence symmetric theta multipliers correspond to \u03c8 : B \u2192 {\u00b11}.\nMumford's morphism for abelian varieties, induced by the toric morphism (2.11),\nis the starting point for his study of homogeneous coordinate rings of abelian varieties. Our preparatory work allows us to hope that at least part of this study can\nbe extended to the quantum case.\n\nAppendix. Commutative Geometry as Noncommutative Geometry\nThe main goal of this Appendix is to illustrate Connes approach to noncommutative geometry in an algebraic geometric context and to make convincing our\nclaim that an elliptic curve \"is\" a two\u2013dimensional noncommutative torus.\nWe take as our starting point Connes explanations about how to treat as a non\u2013\ncommutative space quotient of a \"commutative space\" by an equivalence relation\nor equivalence groupoid: see [Co], II.2\u2013II.5. This viewpoint is complementary to\nthe more popular in algebraic geometry deformation paradigm.\nFirst, a reminder about groupoids.\nLet U be a set. Classically, an equivalence relation \u223c on U is given by its graph\nR \u2282 U \u00d7 U, R := {(a, b) | a \u223c b} which satisfies the three conditions:\nReflexivity:\na \u223c a \u21d0\u21d2 \u2206U \u2282 R;\nSymmetry:\n(a \u223c b \u21d4 b \u223c a) \u21d0\u21d2 s12 (R) = R;\nTransitivity:\n((a \u223c b)&(b \u223c c) \u21d2 a \u223c c) \u21d0\u21d2 pr13 [(R \u00d7 U ) \u2229 (U \u00d7 R)] \u2282 R.\nAll of this can be rephrased as follows: there exists a category with the set of\nobjects U, set of morphisms R, such that R \u2192 U \u00d7 U is the map f 7\u2192 (source\nof f , target of f ), and in addition, every morphism is an isomorphism, and all\nautomorphism groups are trivial.\nConsider now a diagram R \u2192 U \u00d7 U satisfying this description with the last\ncondition deleted so that the automorphism groups can now be arbitrary. We\nwill call such a diagram an equivalence groupoid (on the set U ). Of course, an\n\n\f22\n\nequivalence groupoid R \u2192 U \u00d7 U comes together with the identity map U \u2192 R :\na 7\u2192 ida and the associative multiplication map R \u00d7U R \u2192 R satisfying the usual\ncategorical axioms which reduce to the reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity for\nthe usual equivalence relations. Notice that the image of R is in fact an equivalence\nrelation, and the respective quotient is the set of isomorphism classes of objects.\nThus the basic difference between equivalence groupoids and equivalence relations on sets can be demonstrated on one\u2013point sets U = {\u2217}: in this case R is\nsimply a group. In the framework of homotopy theory, the respective quotient object {\u2217}/R is represented by the classifying space BR. Stacks provide a categorical\ncontext for constructing such quotients in algebraic geometry.\nIn fact, the notion of equivalence groupoid was formulated in such a way that\nit readily generalizes to the case when R \u2192 U \u00d7 U is a diagram in an arbitrary\ncategory with products, e.g. schemes. One should imagine U as an atlas and R as\ngluing rules, so that the geometric object we are interested in is symbolically U/R.\nConnes prescription, roughly speaking, consists in reducing geometric study of\nX = U/R to the representation theory of a non\u2013commutative ring RX . The heuristic rule for constructing RX can be stated as follows. Let us write elements (points)\nof R as morphisms j : u \u2192 u\u2032 so that R \u2192 U \u00d7U maps such a point to (u, u\u2032 ). Then\nRX consists of certain functions f on R endowed with convolution multiplication:\nX\n(f \u2217 g)(k : u \u2192 u\u2032\u2032 ) =\nf (j : u \u2192 u\u2032 ) g(i : u\u2032 \u2192 u\u2032\u2032 ) .\n(A.1)\n(i,j): ij=k\n\nOf course, correct choice of the class of functions and making sense of the convolution multiplication may present a problem, but in algebraic geometry it is clear\nwhat to start with at least when U is affine.\nLet us illustrate such a setup by several examples.\nExample 1. If X is the quotient {\u2217}/G where G is a finite group, then RX is\nthe group ring of G. Representation theory of RX is essentially K\u2013theory of the\nclassifying stack of G, in accordance with the common wisdom.\nExample 2. If X is the quotient of an affine scheme U = Spec A by the action of\na group G, then RX should contain at least the twisted product of A with a version\nof the group ring of G.\nWhen U = Gm with coordinate y and G = Z with generator x acting on y as\nmultiplication by q, then in this twisted product we have xyx\u22121 = qx that is, the\nbasic relation of the noncommutative torus. On the other hand, U/G makes sense\nas an elliptic curve in analytic geometry, if |q| =\n6 1.\nExample 3. A projective scheme Proj A is the quotient of its cone Spec A (with\nvertex deleted) by the action of Gm determining the grading. Studying representations of the twisted product of A with the group ring of Gm is equivalent to studying\n\n\f23\n\ngraded A\u2013modules. Deleting the vertex boils down to taking the quotient of the\ncategory of graded modules by the subcategory of modules with finite number of\nnonvanishing components. This is the familiar Serre's picture which is archetypal\nin the following sense: after finding an appropriate ring RX , one proceeds to establish an equivalence of categories RX \u2013Mod \u2192 CohX , or its localized and/or derived\nversion.\nReferences\n[AP] D.
