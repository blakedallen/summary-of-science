Introduction\nA broad range of materials with various types of molecular forces form close-packed atomic structures\n[1, 2, 3]. Of the elements, the noble gases and many metals from close-packed crystal structures, i.e.\na significant fraction of the periodic system. For simple atomic lattices, close-packing is defined by the\ngeometry of hard spheres which minimize the volume occupied by the spheres. Likewise, helical structures\nformed of flexible tubes with hard walls have a most favorable packing in the sense of the best use of space.\nRecently, we have shown that the helical motifs of DNA and alpha-helices are in rather fair agreement\nwith the close-packed double and single helices [4]. This opens the question of the agreement not being\ncoincidental, and suggests that the optimization of the volume fraction may be at play as a contributing\nfactor in the formation of the molecular structures.\nSome structural motifs of biological chain molecules have previously been discussed as various conformations of tubes [5]. When emphasizing one kind of optimum shape of helices, knots and other structures,\nthe global curvature of a space curve has been introduced, see Gonzalez and Maddocks [6] and Maritan\net al. [7]. As an example of such an optimum structure, Maritan et al. [7] depict the helical structure\nwith a pitch angle of vT P = 21.8\u25e6 . This helical structure is at the transition between two regimes [7];\nin ref. [4] we have denoted this particular structure as being tightly packed. In the case of the single\nhelix, the pitch angle of the tightly packed helix differs only by a relatively small amount from that of\nthe close-packed helix. However, for double helices the difference in the pitch angle for the two structures\nis 12.5\u25e6 . Moreover, one of the interesting features of the close-packed double helical structure is that it\nhas a central channel (the tightly packed double helix has no central channel).\nIn this paper, we will investigate the packing of the triple helix and thereby revisit the question of the\nstructure of collagen. The phrase triple helix is ambiguous; some of us will instinctively think of three\ninterwoven helices that share the same axis around which they are twisted; others will think of three\n(single) helices which are twisted individually around their own axis and which may be super-coiled (SC)\n\n2\n\n\faround each other. The first category is akin to the double-helix of DNA, while the second type is akin\nto the super-coiling of two \u03b1-helices.\nRamachandran & Kartha [8, 9] had the insight to suggest a triple helix for the structure of collagen in\n1954. This insight became supported by Rich and Crick [10, 11] who suggested a variant - known as the\nsuper-coiled 10/3 structure. The triple-strand nature of the structure was corroborated by sequencing.\nLater, Okuyama et al. suggested the super-coiled 7/2 structure [12]. Presumably, the long collagen\ntriple helix can be incommensurate, a view accredited to have been shared by Ramachandran [13], see\nalso Cameron et al. [14]. The supermolecular structure of fibrous collagen has been examined in a\nsynchrotron x-ray study by Orgel et al. [15]. Collagen-like peptides have been theoretically investigated\nby DFT [16] and molecular dynamics [17]. For a review of the structure and stability of the long collagen\nmolecules and the fibrils, see Kadler et al. [18] and Shoulders and Raines [19]. For a discussion of\nmechanical properties on different length scales see Buehler [20].\nInterestingly, it is still debated whether the 10/3 structure (3.3 residues/turn) suggested by Rich\nand Crick [10] or the 7/2 structure (3.5 residues/turn) suggested by Okuyama et al. [21, 12] is the\nbetter descriptor of collagen? Some collagen-like peptides have been assigned the 10/3 structure in\ncrystallographic structures, see Bella et al. [22], for a summary see Beck and Brodsky [23]. Other\npeptides have been assigned the 7/2 structure [24]. Descriptions with variable twist angles are now\ncommon [25, 26, 27, 28]. In all cases, the R-factors have remained relatively large. To us it leaves open\nthe possibility that a third structure would be in better agreement with the data than either of the ones\nthat were considered in the past.\n\n2. The triple helix\n\na)\n\na)\na)\na)\n\nb)\nb)\nb)\n\nb)\nc)c)\n\nc)\n\nc)\n\nFigure 1: Different topological structures of triple helices made out of three identical tubes of tube diameter\nD. a) Supercoiled 10/3 structure. b) Supercoiled 7/2 structure. c) The close-packed (CP) triple helix\n(left-handed variant), which is not supercoiled\n\nWe suggest the close-packed tube geometry as a possible packing principle of the triple helical structure\n3\n\nd)\n\n\fof collagen based on the knowledge of its higher volume fraction. Here we develop the motif in some\ndetail. Figure 1 a) and b) shows the triple helices as three single helices that are super-coiled around\neach other. Figure 1 c) shows the close-packed motif that consists of three interwoven helices that share\nthe same axis. For the triple-helix with a single twist axis the parametric equations are\n\n~r1\n\n=\n\n~r2\n\n=\n\n~r3\n\n=\n\n(a cos t1 , a sin t1 , ht1 )\n2\u03c0h\n)\n3\n4\u03c0h\n(a cos t3 , a sin t3 , ht3 +\n)\n3\n(a cos t2 , a sin t2 , ht2 +\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\nwhere h = H/2\u03c0 is the reduced pitch height and a is the radius of the cylinder surface hosting the helical\ncurves. The direction of the tangent is found through differentiation, d~ri /dti = (\u2212a sin ti , a cos ti , h). The\ntangent to each of these curves is at the helix angle, v, with the vertical axis. Hence, the pitch angle,\nv\u22a5 = 90\u25e6 \u2212 v is determined by\nh\n(2.4)\ntan v\u22a5 = .\na\nThe triple helical lines presented above and the analyses in the following follow a right-handed helical\nstructure. The optimum for a left-handed system is simply found by mirror symmetry and therefore\nimposes the same scale parameters on the triple-helix. In Figure 1c) is depicted the left-handed solution\nwhich is also the one chosen for the atomistic considerations below as it appears to have a more realistic\nRamachandran plot.\nFor two points on the surface of the helical tubes to be in contact, it is a requirement that the distance\nbetween the central helical lines of the tubes is a minimum. Consider two points on two of the helical\nlines of the symmetric triple-helix: ~r1 = (a, 0, 0) and ~r2 = (a cos t, a sin t, ht + 2\u03c0h/3). The square of their\ndistance, D3 , is\n2\u03c0h\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u21922\n+ ht)2 ;\n(2.5)\nD32 = |\u2212\nr\u2212\n1 r2 | = a (cos t \u2212 1) + a sin t + (\n3\nthe derivative determines the possible minima. We find the condition that D3 is an extremum as:\nsin t +\n\nh2 2\u03c0 h2\n+ 2t = 0 .\na2 3\na\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe triple-helix is packed when D3 = D, where D is the diameter of the tubes. For discussions of contacts\nin tube models see also Przybyl and Piera\u0144ski [29], and Neukirch and van der Heijden [30].\n2.1. The close-packed triple helix\nThe close-packed triple helix is found by considering an enclosing cylinder of volume VE = 2\u03c0 2 h(a +\nD/2)2 , and comparing it to the volume occupied by the three helical tubes, VH = 3\u03c0HD2 /(4 sin v\u22a5 ).\nThe volume fraction is the ratio VH /VE :\na\n2a\nfV = 3(1 + ( )2 )1/2 * ( + 1)\u22122 .\nh\nD\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn Figure 2 is shown fV for the packed helices. Numerically, the maximum is found to be at a pitch\nangle of vCP = 43.3\u25e6 , and the corresponding fraction of volume occupied to be fCP = 0.744. The unique\npacked structure with this value of v\u22a5 is henceforth called the close-packed (CP) triple helix.\nFor the volume of the tube models in Figure 1 to be compared, the scale of the parameters needs to\nbe determined. As the diameter of the three backbone tubes we use Dp = 5.0 \u00c5 estimated from the\n4\n\n\f1.0\n0.8\n0.6\nfV\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\u03a5!\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFigure 2: Volume fraction fV for the packed triple helix. The maximum packing fraction is fCP = 0.744\nand is obtained for a pitch angle vCP = 43.3\u25e6 . The dashed vertical line represents the corresponding\nclose-packed (CP) structure\n\ntube model of the \u03b1-helices (a = 2.3 \u00c5 and 2a/Dp = 0.91) [4]. For the raise per residue, HR , and per\ntriplet of residues, HT = 3HR , we will use 2.86 \u00c5 and 8.57 \u00c5, numbers well-known from x-ray diffraction\n[23, 24]. These numbers are the same for the 10/3 and the 7/2 models also discussed. For the super coiled\nstructure, the corresponding volume fraction determined by an enclosing cylinder is found to be about\n0.6. This number depends on how the single helices are rotated relative to the super coiled structure. It\nis \u223c 20% smaller than the volume fraction (0.74) of the close-packed structure.\n\n2.2. The central channel\nIt is a feature of the packed triple helices that they all have central channels. This is not the case for\npacked double helices where no central channel exists for v\u22a5 \u2265 45\u25e6 [4]. The radius, Ri = a \u2212 D/2, of the\ncentral channel increases with decreasing pitch angle, v\u22a5 , see Figure 3. The numbers which characterize\nthe close-packed structure are given in Table 1.\nTable 1: The close-packed (CP) triple helix: a is the radius of the hosting cylinder, v\u22a5 is the pitch angle,\nD is the diameter of the three tubes, Ri the radius of the central channel, and Ro the radius of a cylinder\ncircumscribing the triple helix; fV is the packing fraction.

The\nminimum values of Ri are here plotted as a function of pitch angle, v\u22a5 , for the triple helix with tube\ndiameter D = 5 \u00c5. The close-packed triple helix, dashed vertical line at v\u22a5 = 43.3\u25e6 , has an inner radius\nof Ri = 1.06 \u00c5\n\nis affected by how the helix is twisted. If a helix is being strained, some of the stress can be released by\na small change in the pitch angle. For a long molecule the consequence is that one end may rotate by a\nsignificant amount relative to the other end. Here, we investigate this in more details. The total twist,\n\u03b8M , of one of the helical tubes, as one advances the length LM along the tube is\n\u03b8M =\n\nLM cos v\u22a5\n.\na\n\n(2.8)\n\nFor the triple helix, \u03b8M /LM has its maximum at v\u22a5 = 42.8\u25e6 , see Figure 4. At this particular angle\nthere is no differential change in \u03b8M with v\u22a5 and therefore no geometrical coupling of strain to twist.\nWe denote the corresponding structure as the zero-twist structure. The zero-twist angle, vZT = 42.8\u25e6 ,\nis essentially equal to the pitch angle for close-packing, vCP = 43.3\u25e6 . This is a unique feature of the\ntriple helix which does not hold for the double helix, nor for the quadruple helix, see Table 2. The CP\ntriple helix motif is therefore particularly well-suited to form very long structures in situations where a\nzero-twist structure is desirable. E.g. in tendon and bone.\n\nTable 2: The pitch angles of the zero-twist structures, vZT , and of the close-packed helices, vCP , for the\ndouble, triple, and quadruple helices.\nNo. of strands 2\n3\n4\nvZT\nvCP\n\n39.4\u25e6\n32.5\u25e6\n\n42.8\u25e6\n43.3\u25e6\n\n43.8\u25e6\n53.7\u25e6\n\n6\n\n\f0.8\n\nD \u0398M !2 LM\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nv!\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFigure 4: The dimensionless normalization, D\u03b8M /2LM , of the twist, \u03b8M , of one of the three tubes (length\nLM ) plotted as a function of the pitch angle.

At this pitch angle there\nis no geometrical coupling between strain and twist\n\n3. Discussion\nHere we review some of the implications if collagen were packed in accordance with the CP triple\nhelix motif.\n3.1. Equatorial scattering and the Haisa data\nIn order to investigate if scattering of x-rays in the equatorial plane could distinguish between the CP\nand the SC structures the squared structure factors are calculated as\n|S(~q)|2 \u221d |\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1(~r) exp(\u2212i~q * ~r)dA|2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere ~q is the scattering vector and \u03c1 the electron density. The projection of \u03c1 on the equatorial plane\ndepends only on r. If we assume there is water with \u03c1 = 1 surrounding the structure, we can calculate\n|S(q)|2 more easily by subtracting a constant of 1 from \u03c1. The absolute square of the structure factor\nbecomes\n2\n\nZ\n\nRo\n\nZ\n\n|S(q)| \u221d |\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c1e (r) exp(\u2212iqr cos \u03c6)rd\u03c6dr|2 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c1e (r) = \u03c1(r) \u2212 1. Figure 5 shows the calculated density profiles, \u03c1e (r), and intensity profiles |S(q)|2\nfor four different cases a) the CP structure with channel width 1.6 \u00c5 , b) box density profile with central\nchannel, c) Tube structure without channel akin to the two SC structures, and d) box density profile.\nOnly the structures with a channel show appreciable intensity at wave vectors from about 1 to 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 .\nThe CP helical structure has not previously been discussed in the literature. It is therefore necessary\nto carefully reassess if existing x-ray data give support for the CP structure. We find the early paper of\nHaisa [31] to be useful as it presents absolute intensity as a function of the scattering angle in the range\n\n7\n\n\f0.4\n0.2\n0.\n!0.2\n!0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.\n!0.2\n!0.4\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.\n\n1.\n\n2.\nq\n\n3.\n\n!S\"q#$2\n\n!S\"q#$2\n\n1.\n\n!S\"q#$2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.\n!0.2\n!0.4\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.\n\n!S\"q#$2\n\n\u03a1!1\n\u03a1!1\n\u03a1!1\n\u03a1!1\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.\n!0.2\n!0.4\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nr\n\nFigure 5: Calculated density profiles, \u03c1e (r) (left column), and intensity profiles, |S(q)|2 (right column)\nfor four different cases: a) the tube structure with a channel of diameter 1.6 \u00c5 , b) box density profile\nwith central channel of the same diameter, c) tube structure without channel akin to the two super-coiled\nstructures, and d) box density profile with no central channel. Here r is measured in \u00c5, q in \u00c5\u22121 , and\n|S(q)|2 in arbitrary units\n\nof interest. The paper report on changes in the diffraction pattern upon various chemical treatments of\ncollagen. In Figure 6 we have redrawn the data for native moist collagen as a function of the scattering\nvector. As one can see, there is a strong resemblance of the diffraction pattern from about 1 \u00c5\u22121 and\nhigher to the Figures 5 a) and b). The peak in the diffraction data at about 0.38 \u00c5\u22121 stems from\ninterference\nfrom one triple helix to a nearby one. Its distance can be estimated to be approximately\n\u221a\n4\u03c0/q 3 = 19 \u00c5. We take the Haisa data as a hitherto overlooked experimental indication for the existence\nof a central channel in collagen. The published 2d-diffraction film images of Ramachandran [8], and\nOkuyama et al. [21] display equatorial streaks of intensity characteristic of a sharp density variation with\ncontinuous symmetry in the longitudinal direction.\n3.2. Crystallographic data\nSignificant interest in studying collagen with crystallographic methods has been executed [32]. For\nsuch studies, collagen-like peptides typically 30 residues long has been used.\nThe structure of collagen-like peptides have been modeled by supercoiled helices (described above),\nin particular by the 7/2 and 10/3 structures . Here, the 7/2 structure mean that the period of the\nsupercoiling is seven triple residues long and for the 10/3 structures the supercoiling is ten triple residues\n8\n\n\fCounts per second\n\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nq\n\nFigure 6: Intensity as a function of the scattering vector, q, in X-ray scattering from native, moist collagen. The original data from Haisa [31] were plotted as a function of scattering angle. Here, after digitizing\nwe have replotted the data as a function of scattering vector. As one can see there is a resemblance of the\ndiffraction pattern from about 0.5 \u00c5\u22121 and higher to the Figures 5 a) and b). The peak in the diffraction\ndata at about 0.38 \u00c5\u22121 stems from interference from one triple helix to a nearby one\n\nlong, i.e. 30 residues. The obtained R-factors are high, typically above 20 %.\nThe backbone line of a super-coiled (SC) structure can be described by the following center curve,\n~r(t):\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n), as sin( ) + ap sin( +\n), t)\n(3.3)\n(as cos( ) + ap cos( +\nhs\nhs\nhd\nhs\nhs\nhd\nwhere\nhd =\n\nhs hp\n.\nhs \u2212 hp\n\n(3.4)\n\nIf as , or ap , are zero we have the simple helix such as in CP structures, otherwise we have a supercoiled\nstructure. For some CP-like structures one might expect a small value for as rather than zero as this\nis the simplest kind of symmetry break the structure can make. However, the two structures will not\nconvert from the one to the other with the use of a typical refinement algorithm. As can be noticed, if\ntransformations are made between a SC structure (e.g. 7/2 structure) and a CP, or near CP, structure\nthere will be intermediate structures where the density of atoms in the center of the molecule will exceed\nunity by a multiple factor (the three backbones need to cross through each other). This will constitute\na barrier for refinement and it is therefore highly unlikely that structure refinements which started with\na SC structure could be able to relax to a CP structure.\n3.3. Relationships between atomistic SC and CP structures\nHere we investigate the relationship between the CP and SC structures depicted in Figure 1 and\nreflect on their plausibility.\n[Pro-Pro-Gly]10 : As a first attempt to create an atomistic CP model, we build on the relationship\nbetween the CP structure and the SC 7/2 and 10/3 structures. We start by the simple and classical\nPro-Pro-Gly collagen-like peptide [25]. Its PDB entry 1k6f is in the SC motif, depicted in Fig. 7 a).\nThis structure has no side-chains and is therefore particularly symmetric. For the purpose of bringing\nthe three peptide chains in their right positions, we first deconstruct the supercoiled structure and then\nconstruct the CP structure in the following way: we unwind the supercoil, and thereafter unwind each\nof the three peptide helices. Thereafter, the rotational phases of each of the three chains and the radial\nposition of the chains are adjusted, and finally the three strands are coiled to the CP structure. In Figure\n9\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nFigure 7: Approximate atomistic models and PDB entries: a) of the PDB 1k6f structure, and b) of the\nalternative CP structure derived in this paper, c) of the PDB 2drx structure, and d) of the alternative\nCP structure. Notice the helical lines of the Hydroxyproline OH groups in d)\n\n7 b) we have depicted the resulting atomic structure. This method does not maintain all bond lengths.\nIn particular, the individual nature of the refined atomic positions in the PDB entry for the SC structure\ntransform into a kind of random noise for the reconstructed CP structure. Nevertheless, one can get an\nimpression of the main features of the derived structure and of the relationship between the structures.\nThe CP structures are not refined by force fields or by other means. In the presented structure there is\nsome freedom for each of the strands to rotate around their own axis, see the discussion of charges below.\n[Pro-Hyp-Gly]4 [Leu-Hyp-Gly][Pro-Hyp-Gly]5 : We also consider a collagen-like peptide relevant for\nbiomineralization [33], PDB entry 2drx, see Figure 7 c). Structures with hydroxyproline form a scaffold\nfor mineralization, and the positions of the OH group of hydroxyproline become particularly important.\nIn Figure 7 d) we show the CP structure, generated by the method described above. One observes\nthat the OH groups of hydroxyproline sit in distinctively different patterns in the two structures. On\nthe CP structure, the oxygens of hydroxyproline sit in two beautiful helical lines on the surface of\nthe tropocollagen with about a 5 \u00c5 repetition. The oxygen of the peptide units are internal in the\ntropocollagen and close to the channel. For the SC structure, the OH group of hydroxyproline sits in\nseveral non-equivalent sites on the surface intermixed with oxygens of the peptide units. For the CP\nstructure, the pitch angle of the helical line formed by the hydroxyproline OH groups depends on the\ndetailed values of the parameters of the structure and the depicted structure is as such a first estimate.\nThe oxygens of the peptides units point towards the channel effectively charging the inner surface of the\nchannel. Presumably this negative charge is balanced by the presence of protons, see the discussion on\n\n10\n\n\fNMR and the magic angle below. The inner surface is less charged if each of the three polypeptide strands\nare rotated around their own axes. Rotations are restricted as they must maintain the hydroxyproline\nOH groups accessible on the outer surface of the tropocollagen.\n3.4. Biomineralization\nBiomineralization is an important process which takes place in various kinds of life [34]. For tropocollagen, perhaps the most significant difference between the suggested close-packed and the supercoiled\nstructure is the existence of a central channel in the CP structure not present in the SC-triple-helix.\nThe diameter of the channel was estimated above to be \u223c 2 \u00c5, too small for water to be transported.\nHowever, it would be quite suitable for protons (ionic radius <0.01 \u00c5), for ionic phosphorus (ionic radius\n0.3 \u00c5) and perhaps for Ca++ (ionic radius 1 \u00c5). We suggest that this is an essential feature enabling\nbiomineralization by allowing for a separation of the positive and negative ions needed for the mineralization. In biomineralization phosphorus and calcium rich minerals are formed, e.g. hydroxyapatite,\ncalcium carbonate and octacalcium phosphate. In bone formation, the hydroxyapatite mineral is formed\nin the space between the tropocollagen.\nIt seems reasonable to assume that the nucleation of minerals takes place on the OH group of hydroxyproline and involves the about two layers thick hydration layer of water. Without a central channel to\nprovide feeding of calcium and phosphorus ions these ions would have to diffuse through the hydration\nlayer. The hydration layer is so thin (about two layers of H2 O) that it is barely thicker than the screening\nlength of the ionic charges and the ionic groups. It is therefore quite possible that the various charges\nwould grid-lock each other and thereby prevent ionic transportation and thus mineralization in taking\nplace. Even if grid-lock would not persist, it seems peculiar that the collagen would mineralize in a\nuniform manner. As with nucleation in general, places where nucleation takes place first are likely to\ngrow the largest grains of mineralized material. This would presumably destroy the ordered structure\nof the mesh formed by the collagen triple helices as well as of the fibrils. Instead, we suggest that the\nphosphorus and calcium ions are transported down the collagen triple helix through the central channel\nto the place where the mineralization takes place. Here mineralization continues radially outwardly until\nthe ions cannot diffuse to the nucleation front. This may explains why mineralization takes place starting\nat one end of the triple collagen helix and working its way along the molecule; it also explains why the\nmineralization is only a few atomic layers thick filling the space between the collagen helices.\n3.5. NMR and the magic angle effect\nIn NMR studies of ordered collagen fibers, e.g. tendon, a striking effect (sometimes named the\nmagic angle effect) has been observed [35, 36]. The effect is important for MR imaging of tendon [37].\nThe magic angle effect is the observation in NMR studies of two split proton-proton dipole interaction\npeaks which vanish at an angle of about \u000f = 55\u25e6 . At this angle, the second-order Legendre polynomial\nP2 (cos(\u000f)) = 3 cos2 \u000f \u2212 1 vanishes. The results show that the dominant contribution stems from pairs of\nprotons which are aligned parallel to the long axis of the tropocollagen. The data is consistent with a\nGaussian distribution aligned with the axis, and with a width of the angular distribution of about 13\u25e6\n(the distribution of alignment of the tropocollagen molecules were not characterized and could contribute\nto the 13\u25e6 spread) [35]. It seems plausible to us that the magic-angle effect can be due to protons being\nhosted by a central channel of the packed triple helix effectively forming a one-dimensional proton lattice.\nPreviously, the signal has been suggested to originate from ordered chains of water molecules aligned to\nthe collagen molecule such that the proton-proton vector is parallel with the direction of the tropocollagen\n[35, 36]. Curiously, this NMR phenomenon has not been observed for other fibrous molecules; in studies\nof silk fibroin, DNA, and keratin it was found that none of these fibrous molecules exhibit the magic\nangle effect [38].\n\n11\n\n\f3.6. Circular dichroism\nCollagen has been extensively studied by measurements of circular dichroism (CD) spectra [39]; nevertheless, the experimental data has not been fully described by model calculations. Bhatnagar and\nGough writes \"It is clear ... that the present theoretical methods do not adequately explain the CD of\npolyproline II and collagen\" [40]. In short, both quantum mechanical exciton based calculation, and classical dipole based calculation fails to adequately describe the experimental data. For a related discussion\nwith comparative results for different theoretical approaches, see Carlson et al. [41]. Perhaps, the most\nstraightforward explanation for this is that the current structural understanding of the collagen molecule\nis inadequate.\n\n4. Conclusion\nWe have derived the condition for triple helices to be packed and calculated the volume fraction\nfor the close-packed helix. The volume fraction comes about by defining an enclosing cylinder, and by\nconsidering its measure of volume as an indicator of how closely packed the three helices are. It is found\nthat the condition for being close-packed is to have a pitch angle of vCP = 43.3\u25e6 . Table 1 summarizes\nthese geometrical findings which holds for any triple helix of three tubes. Further, we have shown that\nthere exists a zero-twist (ZT) structure with zero strain-twist coupling, which is a desirable molecular\nproperty for constituents of tendon and bone. For triple helices, the pitch angle of the two structures (CP\nand ZT) are found to be practically identical. Based on these findings we have suggested a new structure\nfor collagen, which differs from the 10/3 and 7/2 conformations. Its three most fundamental features\nare those of being close-packed, of having zero strain-twist coupling, and of having a central channel. It\nseems peculiar if Nature would not have taken advantage of this structure.\nWe find support for the existence of a central channel in early x-ray diffraction data of collagen.\nThe possibility for ion transport in the central channel suggests the need for a reexamination of various\nbiological and physical phenomena, including biomineralization. The new conformation of collagen could\nalso be relevant for understanding some of the collagen related diseases such as osteoporosis, Bethlem\nmyopathy, arterial aneurysm and many more [42].\nSome of the difficulties for the current understanding of the structure of collagen have been reviewed:\nthe ambiguity in assigning crystal structures to crystallographic data for collagen-like peptides, and the\nfailure to satisfactorily calculate circular dichroism data from model structures. Perhaps the angular\ndependence of the piezoelectric effect in bone (Fukada and Yasuda [43]) with its maximum at \u223c 45\u25e6\nis related to the pitch angle of the geometry of the hard wall tube model. For a description of the\npiezoelectric effect in helices, see Kasai [44]. Further, it is interesting to notice that Tiaho et al. have\nreported the determination of a pitch angle of about 41\u25e6 in a second harmonic generation imaging\nmicroscopy study [45]; a value which is close to the CP value.\nOne of the distinctions between the different structures suggested for the tropocollagen molecule are\nthe positions of the OH groups of hydroxyproline on the surface of the molecular structure. Experimental\nstudies with atomic resolution of the mineralization of collagen are likely to be performed within the\nnext 5-10 years, thereby helping to cast light on which of the features of the various suggested collagen\nstructures (CP, 7/2, 10/3) are correct.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Burns G (1985) Solid State Physics (Academic Press, Orlando) ISBN 0-12-146070-3.\n[2] Finnis F (2004) Interatomic forces in materials.
