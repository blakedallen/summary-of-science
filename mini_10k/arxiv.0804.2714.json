Introduction\nThe Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem [1] was a cornerstone of 20th century mathematics,\nsetting off an interplay of ideas between mathematics and physics that has continued\ntill this day. Among the many subsequent re-derivations of this theorem was a formal\ndemonstration by Atiyah [2], following an idea of Witten [3], of the equivalent result\nthat the \u00c2-genus of a spin manifold M can be recovered as a regularized S 1 -equivariant\nEuler characteristic of the normal bundle of M in its free loop space LM.\nIn this note, we extend the regularization of Atiyah and Witten to the case of an\narbitrary complex vector bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192 M of rank m \u2265 2 with spin structure (here,\nM need not be spin). We find that we derive a new multiplicative genus, in the sense\nof Hirzebruch [6], and we introduce this as the \u0393\u0302-genus (see Proposition 3.5).\nThe \u0393\u0302-genus has several interesting properties: for example, it vanishes on all\nRiemann surfaces (see Proposition 5.3). It is the second multiplicative genus that\nincorporates the \u0393 function into its generating function: the first one, to the best of\nour knowledge, was the \u0393-genus coming from mirror symmetry [7, 8]. Furthermore,\nthe \u0393\u0302-function turns out to play an important role in the study of multiple zeta values\n[9, 10], so the results here may be of independent interest.\nThe plan of this note is as follows. In section 2, we recall Hirzebruch's theory\nof multiplicative genera and the theory of equivariant de Rham cohomology. We\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n2\n\ndevelop our proposal for extending the Atiyah\u2013Witten regularization in section 3, and\nre-interpret this algebraically in section 4, using a formalism of Hoffman [11, 12]. In\nsection 5, we compute the \u0393\u0302-genus for some manifolds and describe some of its properties.\nWe conclude with a discussion in section 6.\nThroughout this note, we shall assume that M is a compact, connected, simply\nconnected, oriented, smooth and finite-dimensional manifold, unless otherwise stated.\nIn particular, this means LM is assumed to be connected. We also assume that LM is\nendowed with a topology that makes it an infinite-dimensional smooth Fr\u00e9chet manifold.\n2. Preliminaries\nWe devote this section to a rapid review of Hirzebruch's theory of multiplicative genera\n[6] and equivariant de Rham cohomology. The reader who is interested in more details\nabout the latter theory may refer to the work of Guillemin and Sternberg [13].\n2.1. Multiplicative Genera\nIn Hirzebruch's theory, a multiplicative genus is generated by a multiplicative sequence of\npolynomials {Kn (c1 , . . . , cn )}, where the ci 's are the Chern classes of an almost complex\nmanifold M 2n . This sequence is given by the polynomial coefficients in the series\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\nn\n=\nKn (c1 , . . . , cn )tn ,\nK\ncn t\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nwhere c0 = K0 = 1 by convention. The multiplicative operator K on the left-hand side\nis defined by a generating function\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c6(t) = 1 +\nan tn .\nn=1\n\nIn particular, we set Kn (1, 0, . . . , 0) = an , so that K(1 + t) = \u03c6(t).\nRemark 2.1. We shall preserve the traditional abuse of notation by writing\n{\u03c6n (c1 , . . . , cn )} for the polynomial {Kn (c1 , . . . , cn )}. This is justified by the observation\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between formal power series having constant\nterm 1 and multiplicative sequences [6, Lemmata 1.1 and 1.2].\nWe can then associate to a multiplicative sequence {\u03c6n } a (multiplicative) genus,\nwhich we shall call the \u03c6-genus. This is defined for an almost complex 2n-manifold M 2n\nby\n\u03c6(M 2n ) := h\u03c6n (c1 , . . . , cn ), [M 2n ]i,\n\nwhere the ci 's are the Chern classes of M 2n and [M 2n ] is the fundamental class of M 2n .\nThe \u03c6-genus is multiplicative in the following sense (cf. [6, Lemma 10.2.1]):\nLemma 2.2. Let M and N be two almost complex manifolds, and M \u00d7N be the product\nmanifold endowed with the product almost complex structure. Then every multiplicative\nsequence {\u03c6n } defines a multiplicative \u03c6-genus, in the sense that\n\u03c6(M \u00d7 N) = \u03c6(M)\u03c6(N).\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n3\n\nExample 2.3. The \u00c2-genus of a 4n-manifold M, which gives the index of the Dirac\noperator defined on M if M is spin, is generated by the \u00c2-function\nz/2\n.\n\u00c2(z) =\nsinh(z/2)\nExample 2.4. Let \u0393\u0302(z) := e\u03b3z \u0393(1 + z) be the \u0393\u0302-function. Recall that 1/\u0393(1 + z) and\n1/\u0393\u0302(z) are both entire functions having power series representations with 1 as the\nconstant term, so by Hirzebruch's theory, they also generate multiplicative genera. We\nshall refer to the multiplicative genus generated by 1/\u0393\u0302(z) (resp. 1/\u0393(1 + z)) as the\n\u0393\u0302-genus (respectively, the \u0393-genus, following Libgober [7]).\nRemark 2.5. Under our standing assumptions for manifolds, we observe, following\nHirzebruch [6, p. 76], that \u03c6(M 2n ) is determined by \u03c6n (c1 , . . . , cn ). Thus, in section 5,\nwe shall give the value of \u0393\u0302n , which should now be regarded as a polynomial in Chern\nnumbers, where the \u0393\u0302-genus of M 2n is intended.\n2.2. Equivariant Cohomology and Localization\nEquivariant cohomology is usually defined with respect to the action of a group (the\ncircle S 1 throughout this note). However, as we are working with differential forms, we\nshall use an infinitesimal model that Atiyah and Bott developed in [14] (though it was\nalready implicit in the work of H. Cartan [15, 16]). Following Atiyah and Bott, we shall\nwork with the complex numbers as our base field.\nLet M be a manifold with an S 1 -action generated by the fundamental vector field\nX. The ordinary S 1 -equivariant (de Rham) cohomology of V is then defined to be\nHS\u2022 1 (M) := H \u2022 (\u03a9S 1 (M)[u], dS 1 ).\nThe complex is the graded ring of polynomials in an indeterminate u of degree 2 with\ncoefficients in the S 1 -invariant differential forms of M, while dS 1 := d + u\u03b9X is the\nequivariant differential and \u03b9X is contraction with X.\nOne feature of equivariant cohomology is that it satisfies a localization theorem.\nThis is stated in terms of the localized S 1 -equivariant cohomology of a manifold M,\nwhich is given by\nu\u22121 HS\u2022 1 (M) := H \u2022 (\u03a9S 1 (M)[u, u\u22121 ], dS 1 ).\nTheorem 2.6. (cf. [14]) The inclusion i: F \u0592\u2192 M in M of the fixed point set F of\nthe S 1 -action induces an isomorphism i\u2217 : u\u22121HS\u2022 1 (V ) \u2192 u\u22121HS\u2022 1 (M) on localized S 1 equivariant cohomology. Since the S 1 -action on F is trivial\nu\u22121 H \u2022 1 (F ) \u223c\n= H \u2022 (F ) \u2297 C[u, u\u22121 ],\nS\n\nwhere H \u2022 (F ) is the ordinary cohomology of F .\n\nA consequence of this is the integration formula of Duistermaat and Heckman [4, 5].\nThis was independently derived by Berline and Vergne [17], who also realized that the\nequivariant Euler class appears in the formula. The following theorem summarizes the\nresults about the integration formula that we shall need in this note (cf. also [18]).\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n4\n\nTheorem 2.7. Let M be a manifold with an action of the circle S 1 . Let X be the\nfundamental vector field generating the S 1 -action on M, F be the fixed point set of the\nS 1 -action with inclusion i: F \u0592\u2192 M, and \u03bdF be the normal bundle of F in M such that\n\u03bdF and F have compatible orientations. Let L\u03bdF be the skew-adjoint endomorphism on\n\u03bdF induced by the S 1 -action generated by X and R\u03bdF be the curvature of the S 1 -invariant\nmetric connection on \u03bdF induced from the Riemannian connection on M. Then, for a\nform \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9S 1 (M) that is closed under dS 1 ,\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\n\u0014\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\nL\u03bdF + R\u03bdF\n\u2217\n,\n(1)\n\u03b1=\ni (\u03b1) det\n2\u03c0i\nM\nF\n\nwhere L\u03bdF and R\u03bdF are considered to be complex endomorphisms when taking\ndeterminants. Furthermore, the denominator is the equivariant Euler class e(\u03bdF ) of\nthe normal bundle \u03bdF .\nFinally, we give a construction of an equivariant differential form that represents\nthe class e(\u03bdF ). This is due to Jones and Petrack [19].\n\nProposition 2.8. With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 2.7, let \u03b1 be the differential\nform dual to X. Let \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a9S 1 (M)[u, u\u22121 ] be the S 1 -equivariant form given by\n\u03c4 := e\u2212dS 1 \u03b1 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c0: M \u2192 F be the projection from M to its fixed point set F , and \u03c0\u2217 : \u03a9S 1 (M)[u, u\u22121 ] \u2192\n\u03a9(F )[u, u\u22121] be integration along the fibers of \u03c0. Then,\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\n\u0014\n\u0012\nuL\u03bdF + R\u03bdF\n.\n(3)\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03c4 ) = det\n2\u03c0i\nRemark 2.9. It is interesting to observe that \u03c4 is a factor in the Mathai\u2013Quillen universal\nThom form. The reader is invited to compare (2) with formula (6.9) of [20].\n\nProof. By construction, \u03c4 is a form closed under dS 1 . We note that, since \u03b1 vanishes\non F , \u03c4 satisfies the identity i\u2217 (\u03c4 ) = 1, where i\u2217 (\u03c4 ) is the pullback of \u03c4 by the inclusion\nof the fixed point set F in M. To see that (3) holds, recall that the equivariant Thom\nisomorphism states that, for an equivariant form \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a9S 1 (M)[u, u\u22121 ],\ne(\u03bdF )\u03c0\u2217 (\u03b2) = i\u2217 (\u03b2),\n\nwhere e(\u03bdF ) is the equivariant Euler class of the normal bundle \u03bdF of F in M. Since\ni\u2217 (\u03c4 ) = 1, it follows that\n1\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03c4 ) =\n.\ne(\u03bdF )\nFormula (3) is then an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.7.\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n5\n\n3. Derivation of the \u0393\u0302-genus\nIn this section, we derive the \u0393\u0302-genus. This results from an application of our proposed\nregularization procedure to a complex vector bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192 M with spin structure. We\nalso show that our regularization procedure reduces to the Atiyah\u2013Witten regularization\nwhen E = T M \u2297 C (see Proposition 3.7). Our point of departure is the paper by Jones\nand Petrack [19], but we take a slightly different approach and work in a broader setting.\nWe start with a rank m complex vector bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192 M, for m \u2265 2. Note\nthat we do not require M to be a spin manifold. We endow the vector bundle with\na spin structure, a smooth S 1 -action and a S 1 -invariant metric. Taking loops gives a\nrank m loop bundle (in the sense of Cohen\u2013Stacey [21]) \u03c0l : LE \u2192 LM over LM, with\ninclusions j: E \u0592\u2192 LE and i: M \u0592\u2192 LM, and LU(m) as its structural group. We can\nthen construct, by analogy with the normal bundle construction for T M, the E-normal\nbundle \u03bd(E) \u2192 M. This is defined to be \u03bd(E) := i\u2217 (LE)/E.\nWe now analyze the structure of \u03bd(E) in more detail. Note that \u03bd(E) inherits a\ncomplex vector bundle structure and has a Fourier decomposition\n\u221e\nM\n\u03bd(E) =\nEn ,\nn=1\n\nwhere each of the En is a copy of E with an S 1 -action of weight n.

From physical grounds, Witten [3] has\nargued that LM is orientable if and only if M is spin. Atiyah [2] and Segal [22] have\nshown that, provided \u03c01 (M) = 0, Witten's statement is true, since the obstruction to\nM being spin transgresses to the obstruction to LM being orientable. For real vector\nbundles, McLaughlin [23] has proved the following:\nTheorem 3.2. Let \u03c01 (M) = 0 and E \u2192 M be a real vector bundle with structural group\nSO(n), where n \u2265 4. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) E \u2192 M is a vector bundle with a spin structure.\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n6\n\n(2) The structural group of the real loop bundle LE \u2192 LM can be reduced to L0 SO(n),\nthe connected component of the identity of LSO(n). (This is the condition for the\norientability of a loop space [22].)\n(3) The structural group of LE \u2192 LM has a lifting to L Spin(n).\nBy considering the underlying real bundle of \u03c0 : E \u2192 M, we note that the\nstructural group condition is equivalent to requiring that E \u2192 M has structural group\nU(m) \u2282 SO(2m) for m \u2265 2, i.e. E \u2192 M has to be of rank m \u2265 2. It then follows that\ni\u2217 (LE) \u2192 M, and therefore \u03bd(E) \u2192 M, is orientable if and only if E \u2192 M is spin.\nIt makes sense now to consider the S 1 -equivariant Euler class of the E-normal\nbundle \u03bd(E), which we define as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk\nY\nnuLE + RE\n1\n.\n(5)\n= lim\ndet\ne(\u03bd(E)) := lim\nk\u2192\u221e\nk\u2192\u221e (\u03c0k )\u2217 (\u03c4k )\n2\u03c0i\nn=1\n\nWe show how this class can be written in terms of characteristic classes.\n\nLemma 3.3.

Applying this factorization then yields equation (6) and completes the proof\nof the lemma.\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n7\n\nNote that both infinite products in formula (6) are divergent. We now propose a\nregularization procedure for e(\u03bd(E)). The first infinite product in (6) is handled using\nzeta function regularization (cf.

The sequence is said to be zeta-regularizable if Z\u03bc (s) has a\nmeromorphic continuation to a half plane containing the origin, and this meromorphic\ncontinuation is analytic at the origin and has only simple poles. If {\u03bcn } is a zetaregularizable sequence, its zeta regularized product is defined to be\n\u221e\nY\n\u03bcn := exp(\u2212Z\u03bc\u2032 (0)).\nz\nn=1\n\nIt follows from the definition that if c is any nonzero number, then (cf.

We remark that in the language of Weierstrass's theory of infinite products,\nwhat \u03c8reg achieves is to append a convergence factor to each factor of the form (1 + A).\nIn particular, when the number of factors tends to infinity, the resultant infinite product\nis well-known to be uniformly convergent in every bounded set.\nWe then define the regularized S 1 -equivariant Euler class of \u03bd(E) to be\n\" k m \u0012\n\u0013#\n\u221e \u0010\nYY\nY\n2\u03c0xj\nnu \u0011m\n.\n1+\n* lim \u03c8reg\nereg (\u03bd(E)) :=\nz 2\u03c0\nk\u2192\u221e\nnu\nn=1 j=1\nn=1\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n8\n\nProposition 3.5.

Multiple Zeta Values and an Algebraic Formalism\nIn this section, we describe an algebraic formalism, developed by Hoffman [11] in his\nstudy of multiple zeta values (MZVs), that allows us to give an alternative interpretation\nof the map \u03c8reg in our proposed regularization of the inverse equivariant Euler class.\nTo set up Hoffman's formalism, we first recall some basic theory of symmetric\nfunctions [27]. Recall that the elementary symmetric polynomials {ei } are generated by\nthe function\n\u221e\n\u221e\nY\nX\nE(t) =\n(1 + xn t) =\nei ti ,\nn=1\n\ni=0\n\nwhile the power sum symmetric polynomials {pi } are generated by the function\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\nd\n\u22121\nP (t) =\nlog(1 \u2212 xn t) =\npi ti\u22121 .\ndt\nn=1\ni=1\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n10\n\nIt is clear that these two functions satisfy the following relation\nd\nlog E(\u2212t)\u22121 .\n(14)\nP (t) =\ndt\nWe shall also need the monomial symmetric polynomials {m\u03bb }, where \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . .)\nis a partition of an integer n > 0, i.e. a sequence of numbers \u03bb1 > \u03bb2 > * * * with finitely\nP\nmany nonzero entries such that \u221e\ni=1 \u03bbi = n. Note that each of these collections of\nsymmetric polynomials form a basis for Sym, the algebra of symmetric functions in\ninfinitely many variables.\nIn his study of MZVs, Hoffman [11] has defined a homomorphism Z: Sym \u2192 R,\nsuch that on the power sum symmetric polynomials pi ,\nZ(p1 ) = \u03b3,\n\nZ(pi ) = \u03b6(i) for i \u2265 2.\n\nIn particular, Z acts on the generating function P (t) to give\n\u221e\nX\nZ(P (t)) = \u03b3 +\n\u03b6(i)ti\u22121 = \u2212\u03c8(1 \u2212 t),\ni=2\n\nwhere \u03c8(z) is the logarithmic derivative of \u0393(z). It follows from (14) that\n1\nZ(E(t)) =\n\u0393(1 + t)\n\nWe now observe that a similar map \u1e90: Sym \u2192 R can be defined to yield the \u0393\u0302function. Essentially, \u1e90 is a truncated version of Z and acts on the power sum symmetric\npolynomials in the following way:\n\u1e90(p1 ) = 0,\n\n\u1e90(pi ) = \u03b6(i) for i \u2265 2.\n\nIt follows that\n1\n\n.\n\u0393\u0302(t)\nWe use this formalism to deduce the following\n\u1e90(E(t)) =\n\n(15)\n\nProposition 4.1.

It follows from (15) that the right-hand side also yields the same\nexpression.\nWe now state a straightforward variation of a result of Hoffman, which gives a\nrather elegant description of the coefficients of the multiplicative \u0393\u0302-sequence.

Some Properties of the \u0393\u0302-genus\nIn this section, we compute the \u0393\u0302-genus for some manifolds and give some properties of\nthe \u0393\u0302-genus. We note that we only need M to be an almost complex manifold for \u0393\u0302(M)\nto be well-defined, so we will not require M to be spin in this section.\nWe begin by listing, in Table 1, the first few polynomials of the multiplicative\nsequence {\u0393\u0302n }. These are computed using the algorithm described by Libgober and\nWood [28], who refined it from a brief description given by Hirzebruch [6].\nExample 5.1. Table 2 gives the values of the \u0393\u0302-genus of CPn for small values of n. These\nare computed using the formula for the total Chern class of CPn\nc(CPn ) = (1 + hn )n+1 ,\nwhere hn \u2208 H 2 (CPn , Z) is a generator for the second cohomology group of CPn .\n\nExample 5.2. Consider the product of a K3 surface with the 2-sphere M = K3 \u00d7 S 2 .\nUsing twistor theory, LeBrun [29] has shown that on M, there is a family of complex\nstructures Jn parametrized by an integer n > 0. Thus, for each n, we have the following\nChern numbers for M (cf. also [30]):\nc31 (M, Jn ) = 0,\n\nc2 c1 (M, Jn ) = 48n,\n\nc3 (M, Jn ) = 48.\n\n(16)\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n12\n\nFor n = 1, M has the product complex structure, so that since \u0393\u0302(S 2 ) = 0, it follows\nfrom Lemma 2.2 that \u0393\u0302(M, J1 ) = 0. The vanishing of the \u0393\u0302-genus for (M, J1 ) can also\nbe verified by comparing (16) with Table 1. However, for all other values of n, \u0393\u0302(M, Jn )\ndoes not vanish, so we see that the \u0393\u0302-genus of a 6-manifold depends on the choice of its\ncomplex structure. This also shows that all the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2 are needed\nfor the lemma to be true.\nWe give some properties of the \u0393\u0302-genus for certain almost complex manifolds.\nProposition 5.3. Let M be a smooth almost complex manifold. The \u0393\u0302-genus has the\nfollowing properties:\n(1) The \u0393\u0302-genus vanishes for any Riemann surface \u03a3. Furthermore, if M \u00d7 \u03a3 is a\nproduct of a Riemann surface with M, and has the almost complex structure induced\nfrom those of M and \u03a3, then its \u0393\u0302-genus also vanishes.\n(2) The \u0393\u0302-genus is a smooth invariant for M if M is a 4- or 8-manifold. However,\nit depends on the choice of a complex structure on M if M is a 6-manifold and,\ntherefore, cannot be a smooth invariant of any almost complex 12-manifold that is\na product of two smooth almost complex 6-manifolds.\nProof. For (1), this follows from the vanishing of \u0393\u03021 (c1 ) and Lemma 2.2.\nFor (2), we first consider the case where M is a 4-manifold. In this case, we note\nthat c21 \u2212 2c2 is just the first Pontrjagin class, so that the \u0393\u0302-genus is a multiple of the\nfirst Pontrjagin number, which is a topological invariant of a smooth 4-manifold.\nNext, if M is an 8-manifold, we observe that \u0393\u03024 (c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 ) simplifies to\n1\n1\n1\n\u0393\u03024 (c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 ) = ( (\u03b6(2))2 \u2212 \u03b6(4))p21 + \u03b6(4)p2.\n8\n4\n2\nThus, the \u0393\u0302-genus is again a linear combination of Pontrjagin numbers, and therefore a\nsmooth invariant, for an 8-manifold.\nIf M is a smooth 6-manifold, however, Example 5.2 shows that none of the Chern\nnumbers, except for c3 , can be a smooth invariant of M. Hence, \u0393\u03023 (c1 , c2 , c3 ) cannot be\na smooth invariant, since it is a polynomial in terms of all three Chern numbers. Since\nthe \u0393\u0302-genus is multiplicative, it cannot therefore be a smooth invariant for a 12-manifold\nthat is a product of two 6-manifolds.\n6. Discussion\nIn this note, we saw that we can extend the Atiyah\u2013Witten regularization of the S 1 equivariant Euler characteristic to the case of complex bundles other than T M \u2297 C. As\na result, the \u0393\u0302-genus, which appears to be a new multiplicative genus, was derived.\nSurprisingly, the \u0393\u0302-genus and the \u0393\u0302-function turn out to have many connections\nto other fields of mathematics and physics. One such connection comes via a related\ngenus, the \u0393-genus of Libgober [7], whose work generalized that of Hosono et al. [8]\nin the study of the mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In comparing the\n\n\fThe \u0393\u0302-genus\n\n13\n\ngenerating functions of these two genera under Hoffman's formalism, we have seen that\nthe \u0393\u0302-genus is simply the \u0393-genus with the Euler constant term removed. After this note\nwas submitted, Katzarkov, Kontsevich and Pantev [33] have introduced the \u0393\u0302-class in\ntheir new work on nc-Hodge theory in mirror symmetry. We note that this is different\nfrom the \u0393\u0302-genus introduced here and is, in fact, essentially Libgober's \u0393-genus.\nThere is a further connection to the study of MZVs besides Hoffman's formalism,\nhowever. It turns out, surprisingly, that the \u0393\u0302-function appears in the context of a\nregularization formula that is used to recover \"missing\" relations between MZVs (see\nthe works of Cartier [9] and Ihara, Kaneko and Zagier [10].) This parallels its appearance\nhere - as a result of our proposed regularization procedure - in the guise of the \u0393\u0302genus.\nAll of these may perhaps shed a little light on some speculative remarks of\nKontsevich [31, \u00a74.6] and Morava [32]. Kontsevich has argued that the functions \u00c2(z)\nand \u0393\u0302(z) lie in the same orbit of the action of the Grothendieck\u2013Teichm\u00fcller group on\ndeformation quantizations, while Morava has proposed a context in algebraic topology\nfor the appearance of the \u0393-genus. The results in this note may point towards more\nevidence for these conjectural remarks.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure for the author to thank his supervisors: Prof. V.
