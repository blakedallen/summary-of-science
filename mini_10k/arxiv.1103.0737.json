Marvin Herndon\nTransdyne Corporation\nSan Diego, CA 92131 USA\nmherndon@san.rr.com\n\nKey Words: paleolatitude, paleoclimate, paleomagnetism\n\nAbstract: The discovery of close-to-star gas-giant exo-planets lends support to the idea of\nEarth's origin as a Jupiter-like gas giant and to the consequences of its compression, including\nwhole-Earth decompression dynamics that gives rise, without requiring mantle convection, to the\nmyriad measurements and observations whose descriptions are attributed to plate tectonics. I\nshow here that paleolatitude determinations, used extensively in Pangaea-like reconstructions\nand in paleoclimate considerations, may be subject to potentially significant errors if rockmagnetization was acquired at Earth-radii less than present.\n\nDeciphering the record of Earth's ancient magnetic field, imprinted in the minerals of\nrocks during cooling and/or chemical alteration and/or deposition, has wide-ranging applicability\nand importance. For decades, estimates of rock-sample latitude at the time of acquired\nmagnetization, called paleolatitude, have been deduced from measurements the extant magnetic\ninclination. Paleolatitude determinations provide the principal basis for Pangaea-like\nsupercontinent reconstructions and are used extensively in paleoclimate considerations.\nConsequently, great efforts are made to ascertain and eliminate paleolatitude bias-causing factors\n[1, 2]. Here I show in a general framework a potentially significant bias in paleolatitude\nestimates that might arise from determinations made on rock-samples that became magnetized at\nEarth-radii less than the present value, circumstances that new investigations reveal to be quite\npossible [3].\nThe idea that Earth's radius may have been smaller in the past is not new. In 1933,\nHilgenberg [4] envisioned one continent without ocean basins on a globe smaller than Earth's\npresent diameter that subsequently expanded in a process that fragmented and separated\ncontinental masses and formed interstitial ocean basins. Hilgenberg's concept provided the basis\nfor \"Earth expansion theory\" [5]. But Earth expansion theory as formulated is unable to explain\n1\n\n\fthe reason for Earth's initially smaller size or to provide a source for the vast energy required for\nexpansion. Furthermore, the idea that Earth expansion had occurred solely within the past 170\nmillion years, the age of the oldest seafloor, is at odds with geological evidence. Moreover, Earth\nexpansion theory is unable to provide explanations for seafloor topography that are welldescribed by plate tectonics theory. But, for all of its attractive features, plate tectonics theory\nhas underlying problems too, especially being crucially dependent upon the problematic concept\nof mantle convection.\nI have united \"plate tectonics\" and \"Earth expansion\" into a new geodynamic theory,\ncalled whole-Earth decompression dynamics, that describes the consequences of our planet's\nearly formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant [3, 6, 7] and gives rise, without requiring mantle\nconvection, to the myriad measurements and observations whose descriptions are attributed to\nplate tectonics.\nEnvision pre-Hadean Earth, compressed to about 64% of present radius by about 300\nEarth masses of primordial gases and ices. At some point, after being stripped of its massive\nvolatile envelope, presumably by the Sun's super-intense T-Tauri solar winds, internal pressures\nwould build eventually cracking the rigid crust. Powered by the stored energy of protoplanetary\ncompression, Earth's progressive decompression is manifest at the surface by the formation of\ncracks: primary decompression cracks with underlying heat sources capable of extruding basalt,\nand secondary decompression cracks without heat sources that serve as ultimate repositories for\nbasalt extruded from primary decompression cracks. Mid-ocean ridges and submarine trenches,\nrespectively, are examples of these. Secondary decompression cracks serve to increase surface\narea in response to decompression-driven volume expansion. Basalt extruded at mid-ocean\nridges becomes seafloor, spreading and eventually subducting, i.e., falling into secondary\ndecompression cracks, seismically imaged as \"down-plunging slabs\", but without engaging in\nthe process of mantle convection.\nThe supposition that Earth's spin leads to magnetic poles being near geographic poles\nirrespective of Earth's past smaller radius, except during periods of reversals, is reasonable, but\nmay lead the (false) conclusion that rock-magnetization acquired at one radius value would have\nthe same direction at a later increased radius, if no \"continental drift\" occurred.\nFigure 1 shows a hypothetical 4000km \"ancient\" continent cross-section (arc ACE) at a\nradius of 64% of Earth's present radius, OC, and the same \"present\" continent cross-section (arc\nGHI) at present Earth radius, OH. Consider the line OR as a fixed reference, not necessarily a\npole, but relatable to a pole. In Figure 1, clearly no \"continental drift\" has occurred, as the\nreference line OR bisects both the ancient and present continent. Significantly, the ancient\ncontinent subtends an angle, <AOE, that is considerable greater than the angle the present\ncontinent subtends, <GOI: 56.3degrees versus 36.0 degrees.\n2\n\n\fFigure 1. Cross-section of a hypothetical continent, 4000km long, at a time when Earth's radius\nwas 64% of the present radius and at present. Details are described in the text.\nConsider a magnetization direction imprinted in the magnetic minerals of a rock at an arbitrary\npoint along the ancient continent cross-section, (arc ACE). For clarity, here assume that the\nmagnetized rock-unit is located at the continent's edge, point A, and has magnetization direction\nindicated by M. Because of the decompression-driven increase in planetary radius and\nconcomitant increase in ocean-floor surface area, the direction of the ancient magnetization, M,\nwhen observed later at point G, will appear to have been acquired at a different paleolatitude. To\nillustrate, imagine moving the rock-unit with its acquired magnetization to point G in a two-step\nprocess. Imagine first moving the rock-unit the distance OG along the radial extension OF; note\nthat its magnetization, M*, at point F is parallel to M. Clearly, the second movement of the rockunit to bring it to point G will involve closing <FOG, thus rotating the apparent direction of M\nby <FOG; in this example by 10.1 degrees.\nAs shown in the above hypothetical example, significant potential bias in paleolatitude\ndeterminations my arise as a consequence of magnetization having been acquired at Earth radii\nless than present value. In the case of no \"continental drift\", as inferred from Figure 1, the\nmagnitude of the bias, though, should diminish as sampling approaches mid-continent. A second\npotential source of bias, one more difficult to quantify, may arise from internal adjustments\n3\n\n\frelated to changes in curvature. In the example, the present cord length, GI, is 93km longer than\nthe ancient cord length, BD; concomitantly, the maximum rise above the cord at mid-continent is\n170km less in the present than in the ancient.\nIt is not the purpose here to debate the question of whether Earth had a shorter radius in\nthe past, but rather to point to a potential source of error in paleolatitude determinations that,\nonce recognized, may lead to important discoveries. Good science demands considering all\npotential sources of bias.\nAcknowledgement\nI thank Professor Lynn Margulis for encouragement and advice and I thank author-photographer\nReg Morrison for inspiring the present work.\nReferences\n1.\n\nKrijgsman, W. and L.
