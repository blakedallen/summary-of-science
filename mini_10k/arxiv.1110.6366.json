Introduction\nAlmost simultaneously Ritter and Weiss [21] on the one hand and Kakde [8] on\nthe other hand gave a proof of the non-commutative Iwasawa main conjecture over\ntotally real fields for the Tate motive under the assumption that a certain \u03bc-invariant\nvanishes as has been conjectured also by Iwasawa. Actually the article of Ritter\nand Weiss appeared slightly earlier on the arXive and deals with the case of onedimensional p-adic Lie-extensions, which can be combined with Burns' well-known\ninsight in [2, thm. 2.1] (this crucial idea has been presented by Burns already during a\nseminar at the University of Kyoto in early 2006) based on Fukaya and Kato's result\n[4, prop. 1.5.1] to obtain the conjecture for general p-adic (admissible) Lie-extensions.\nKakde's paper, which got its final version practically during this workshop, contains\n- using the same result of Fukaya and Kato - directly a full proof in the general\nsituation. Various special cases have been known by the work of (in alphabetical\norder) Hara [5], Kakde [6], Kato [9] as well as Ritter and Weiss [18].\nSince in both approaches the reduction steps from the general case of one-dimensional\nextensions to the l-elementary extensions (in the language of Ritter and Weiss) or\nto essential pro-p-extensions (in the language of Kakde) are based on the same principles (even though at different places: for Ritter and Weiss with respect to the\nHom-description while in Kakde's case for the K-theory) and since again the generalisation from the pure pro-p case to this slightly more general case follows certain\nstandard techniques, see [24], we restrict in this survey from the very beginning to\nthe one-dimensional pro-p-case. In these notes we shall use the same notation as in\n[22], but for the convenience of the reader we have collected the crucial notation from\n[21] in a glossary below comparing it with Kakde's and our notation, respectively.\nSince during the workshop and hence in this volume Kakde's approach has been\ndiscussed in great detail and we may hence assume greater familiarity with his\ntechniques, many comments in this comparison will be made from the perspective\nof Kade's point of view. So, we want to stress that this certainly does not reflect\nthe historical development as Kakde has probably been influenced by a couple of\nideas from Ritter and Weiss. E.g. the analytic techniques for the actual proof that\nthe abelian p-adic L-functions satisfy the required conditions in order to induce the\n\"non-commutative\" p-adic L-function has been applied first by Ritter and Weiss\nas well as by Kato (in an unpublished preprint about Heisenberg type p-adic Lie\ngroup extensions). For that reason we won't discuss this analytic part at all in this\n1\n\n\fcomparison because again the methods are essentially the same, see [21, \u00a73] and [8,\n\u00a76], respectively.\nOne evident difference between the two works consists of the way of presentation:\nWhile Kakde, who also had partial results in previous publications, delivers an\nalmost self-contained account of a full proof of the main conjecture (even dealing with\narbitrary admissible p-adic Lie extensions) in one ingenious paper, the impressive\nwork of Ritter and Weiss is spread over at least 10 articles [12, 13, 14, 16, 15, 19,\n20, 17, 18, 21], viz naturally in the way as their theory has been developed over\nthe recent decade. The last article, which contains the general result, is rather an\ninstruction how to modify and extend the proofs of earlier results (in less general\ncases) in previous publications combined with an extensive discussion of the new\nM\u00f6bius-Wall-congruence in order to complete the proof in the general case than a\nself-contained proof. A general outline of the overall strategy of the proof is missing\nand the reader is forced even to collect the notation from all the other articles. This\nis somewhat unfortunate as otherwise the strategy of their nice proof could have\nbeen much more easily accessible for the reader.1\nAnother obvious difference is the fact that while Kakde describes K1 (\u039b(G)) modulo\nSK1 (\u039b(G)) in terms of certain relations (some call them congruences) among elements in the units of Iwasawa algebras for certain abelian subquotients of G Ritter\nand Weiss are only interested whether the particular system of abelian pseudomeassures is in the image of K1 . But in the last section of this survey we try to clarify\nwhat can be proved by the methods of Ritter and Weiss towards describing the image of K1 in the product of the K1 's of appropriate subquotients of G in the manner\nof Kakde.\nI am very grateful to Cornelius Greither and Mahesh Kakde for reading an earlier\nversion and suggesting a couple of improvements.\n\n2. Glossary\n\nIn the following the notation in the different columns usually denote the same object,\nbut sometimes it only indicates that they are just closely related.\n\n1In\n\norder to remedy this Ritter and Weiss are apparently thinking about writing a lecture note\nvolume about their approach.\n2\n\n\fKakde\n\nRitter/Weiss\n\np 6= 2\n\nl 6= 2\n\nF\u221e /F\n\nK/k\n\nG = G(F\u221e /F )\n\nG = G(K/k)\n\nF cyc\n\nk\u221e\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393k\n\nH = G(F\u221e /F cyc )\n\nH\n\nA := A(G) := \u039b(G)S = \u039b(G)(p)\n\n\u039b\u2022 (G)\n\n\\\nB := B(G) = \u039b(G)\nS\n\n\u039b\u2227 (G)\n\n\u039b(G)S \u2217 = A(G)[ p1 ]\n\nQG\n\nO/Zp unramified, (\u039b = \u039bO )\n\nO\n\n\u03a3 \u2287 \u03a3ram (F\u221e /F )\n\nfinite set of\nprimes of F\n\nS \u2287 Sram (K/k) \u222a S\u221e\n\nfinite set of\nprimes of k\n\nK0 (\u039b(G), \u039b(G)S ) = K0 (HS ) = K0 (CS )\n\nK0 T \u039b(G)\n\n[R\u0393(G(F\u03a3 /F\u221e ), Qp /Zp )\u2228 ]\n\n\u2735 = \u2735S (\"mhO\" or \"agemO\")\n\n\u03b6F\u221e /F\n\n\u0398, \u03bbF\u221e /F (pseudomeasure)\nif F\u221e /F is abelian\n\nO[[Cong (G)]] = \u039bO (G)ab\n\nT \u039bO (G)\n\n\u03bc = 0 \u21d4 There exists an open pro-p subgroup H \u2032 \u2282 H such that XF = G(F\u03a3 /F)ab (p)\nH\u2032\nis finitely generated over Zp for F = F\u221e\nand\nF\u03a3 the maximal outside \u03a3 unramified extension of F.\n3\n\n\u03bc\u0393\u2032 (XF\u221e ) = 0\nfor some open subgroup \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393\n\n\fKakde - Schneider/Venjakob or this article\n\nRitter/Weiss\n\n\u03c0VU , prVU\n\nU \u0589V\n\ndeflVU\n\nNVU\n\nV \u2286U\n\nresVU\n\nU\n\nT\u0303rV\n\nResVU\n\nL, LB\n\nL\n\nL\n\nL,\n\nQ\n\nU\n\nLU\n\n3. 2-extensions versus perfect complexes\nThe statement of the Main Conjecture (MC) affirms in both approaches the existence\nof an element \u0398, respectively \u03b6 \u2208 K1 (\u039b(G)S ) satisfying firstly a certain interpolation property we shall discuss later and secondly is mapped under the connecting\nhomomorphism of the localisation sequence of K-theory\n\nK1 (\u039b(G)S ) \u2192 K0 (HS ) \u223c\n= K0 (CS )\n\nto the class \u2735S , respectively [R\u0393(G(F\u03a3 /F\u221e ), Qp /Zp )\u2228 ]. To be more precise, one\nuses in general the localisation with respect to the Ore set S \u2217 for the statement of\nthe MC, but assuming the vanishing of \u03bc, it is easily reduced in both approaches to\nthe above statement. Thus the first question which naturally arises is:\nWhy do the classes of R\u0393(G(F\u03a3 /F\u221e ), Qp /Zp )\u2228 and \u2735 = \u2735\u03a3 in the relative K0\nagree?\n\u0393\nLet \u03a9 denote the maximal outside \u03a3 unramified p-extension of F\u221e\n; here we fixed a\nsplitting \u0393 \u2286 G of the projection G \u0589 \u0393. We denote the Galois group G(\u03a9/F ) by\nG\u2032\u03a3 and note that this group is well-known to be (topologically) finitely generated.\nHence, choosing d generators we obtain the following commutative diagram\n\n4\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nN\n/\n\n1\n/\n\n1\n\nN\n\n\u000f\n\n/\n\nR\n\u000f\n\nH\u03a3\u2032\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nFd\n\u000f\n\nG\u2032\u03a3\n\n\u000f\n\n/\n\nG\n\n/\n\nG\n\n1\n/\n\n/\n\n1,\n\n\u000f\n\n1\n1\nin which Fd denotes the free pro-finite group on d elements and all the other groups\nare defined by exactness of the diagram.

Then, by definition\n\u2735 = [M] \u2212 [N] = [M \u2192 N] \u2208 K0 (HS ) \u223c\n= K0 (Chb (HS )),\nwhere HS denotes the exact category of S-torsion \u039b(G)-modules with finite projective dimension while Chb (HS ) denotes the category of bounded complexes in HS\nand the above identification is shown in [25, II. thm. 9.2.2]. We also shall write\nCS := Chperf,S (\u039b(G)) for the category of perfect complexes of \u039b(G)-modules which\nbecome acyclic after tensoring with \u039b(G)S . Under the identification K0 (Chb (HS )) =\nK0 (Chperf,S (\u039b(G))) (cp. [25, II exerc. 9.2, V exerc. 3.14]) we then have\n[M \u2192 N] = [Y \u2192 Zp [[G]] ] \u2212 [Zp [[G]] \u2192 Zp [[G]] ]\n= [Y \u2192 Zp [[G]] ]\n= [R\u0393(G(F\u03a3 /F\u221e ), Qp /Zp )\u2228 ]\nbecause the complex Zp [[G]] \u2192 Zp [[G]] is acyclic and quasi-isomorphisms induce\nidentities in K0 . Thus we have shown the following\nProposition 3.1.\n\u2735 = [R\u0393(G(F\u03a3 /F\u221e ), Qp /Zp )\u2228 ]\n\nin\n\nK0 (HS ) \u223c\n= K0 (Chperf,S (\u039b(G))).\n\n4. Hom-description\nWe shall write Irr(G) for the set of Qp -valued irreducible representations of G with\nfinite image. Considering elements of K1 (\u039b(G)) as maps on (irreducible) representations we obtain a natural homomorphism\n\u00d7\n\nDet : K1 (\u039b(G)) \u2192 Maps(Irr(G), Zp )\ninto maps from Irr(G) to the units of the ring of integers Zp of Qp , which allows for\nexample requiring interpolation properties for elements of the K-group. Of course,\nthe target is \"much bigger\" than the image and one crucial question for the proof\nof the main conjecture consists of finding the most appropriate intermediate target\nin which to work.

The map BrInd is well-defined and BrInd((xU )U ) is GQp - and R(\u0393)invariant, where these action are recalled at the end of this section.\n7\n\n\fProof. Assume firstQthat \u03c1 arises by inflation from \u03c1\u0303 \u2208 Irr(G/Z). First we check that\nthe defining term U DetU ab (xU )(\u03c7U )nU of BrInd((xU )U )(\u03c1) is independent of the\nchoice of representatives (nU \u03c7U )U \u2208S(G,Z) for aG (\u03c1) = aG (\u03c1\u0303) (using our lax notational\nconvention): For any conjugate g(nU \u03c7U )U \u2208S(G,Z) = (ngU g\u22121 \u03c7gU g\u22121 (g * g \u22121))U \u2208S(G,Z)\nwe have by the G-invariance of (xU )U\nY\nDetU ab (xU )(\u03c7gU g\u22121 (g * g \u22121 ))ngU g\u22121\nU\n\n=\n\nY\n\nDetU ab (g \u22121 xgU g\u22121 g)(\u03c7gU g\u22121 (g * g \u22121 ))ngU g\u22121\n\nU\n\n=\n\nY\n\n\u03c7gU g\u22121 (g(g \u22121xgU g\u22121 g)g \u22121)ngU g\u22121\n\nU\n\n=\n\nY\n\n\u03c7gU g\u22121 (xgU g\u22121 )ngU g\u22121\n\ngU g \u22121\n\n=\n\nY\n\nDetU ab (xU )(\u03c7U )nU .\n\nU\n\nNext we show that our (partial) definition sofar is invariant under characters of the\n\u00d7\nkind \u03c7 : G \u0589 \u0393/Z \u2192 Zp . Indeed,\nY\nY\nnU\n\u03c7*\nDetU ab (xU )(\u03c7U )nU =\nResG\nU (\u03c7) * DetU ab (xU )(\u03c7U )\nU\n\nU\n\n=\n\nY\n\nnU\nDetU ab (xU )(ResG\nU (\u03c7)\u03c7U )\n\nU\n\nby the R(\u0393U )-invariance of DetU ab (xU ). But by Lemma 4.2 below (nU ResG\nU (\u03c7)\u03c7U )\nrepresents aG (\u03c7\u03c1), whence we have shown that\n\u03c7 * BrInd((xU )U )(\u03c1) = BrInd((xU )U )(\u03c7\u03c1)\nas claimed.\nIf \u03c1 \u2208 Irr(G) is arbitrary, using (1) we choose some \u03c7\u2032 : G \u0589 \u0393 \u2192 Zp\n\u03c7\u2032 \u2297 \u03c1 is inflated from G/Z. We then define\n\n\u00d7\n\nsuch that\n\nBrInd((xU )U )(\u03c1) := (\u03c7\u2032 )\u22121 * BrInd((xU )U )(\u03c7\u2032 \u2297 \u03c1).\nIf \u03c7\u2032\u2032 is a second such character, we conclude that \u03c7 := (\u03c7\u2032 )\u22121 \u03c7\u2032\u2032 comes from a\ncharacter of G/Z. Using the invariance of BrInd((xU )U ) with respect to such characters as shown above we conclude that BrInd((xU )U ) is well-defined on arbitrary\nirreducible representations of G and hence extends to a homomorphism on R(G)\nbeing R(\u0393)-invariant by construction. Finally the GQp -invariance follows from the\n\u0003\nGQp -invariance of all the DetU ab (xU ) and clearly BrInd is a homomorphism.\nFor a finite group G let R+ (G) denote the free abelian group on the G-conjugacy\n\u00d7\nclasses of characters \u03c6 : U \u2192 Zp , where U is any subgroup of G. We shall write\n8\n\n\f(U, \u03c6)G for the G-conjugacy class of (U, \u03c6). We clearly have a natural isomorphism\nR+ (G) \u223c\n= (\u2295U R(U ab ))G ,\nwhere U runs through all subgroups of G and usually explicit Brauer induction is\ndefined in terms of a section aG of\nR+ (G) \u0589 R(G),\ni.e.,\naG (\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1(U,\u03c6)G (\u03c1)(U, \u03c6)G\n\n(U,\u03c6)G\n\nfor some integers \u03b1(U,\u03c6)G (\u03c1). Note that there is a natural action of any character\n\u00d7\nG\n\u03c7 : G \u2192 Zp on R+ (G), sending (U, \u03c6)G to \u03c7 * (U, \u03c6)G := (U, ResG\nU (\u03c7)\u03c6) .\nLemma 4.2. For every \u03c1 \u2208 R(G) we have \u03b1(U,ResGU (\u03c7)\u03c6)G (\u03c7\u03c1) = \u03b1(U,\u03c6)G (\u03c1), i.e.\naG (\u03c7\u03c1) = \u03c7 * aG (\u03c1).\nProof. According to [23, thm. 2.3.15] the explicit formula for aG is given by\n\u03b1(U,\u03c6)G (\u03c1) =\n\n|U|\n|G|\n\nX\n\n\u03bc(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 ),(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) < \u03c6\u2032\u2032 , ResG\nU \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1) >,\n\n(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 )\u2208(U,\u03c6)G ,\n(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 )\u2286(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 )\n\nwhere \u03bc denotes the M\u00f6bius function on the partially ordered set MG consisting\nof the characters on subgroups (U, \u03c6) of G with the (U, \u03c6) \u2286 (U \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032) if and only\n\u2032\nif U \u2286 U \u2032 and ResUU (\u03c6\u2032 ) = \u03c6 while < , > denotes the usual Schur inner product\n(loc. cit., def. 1.2.7). Since sending (U, \u03c6) to (U, ResG\nU (\u03c7)\u03c6) induces an G-equivariant\nisomorphism \u03c7 : MG \u2192 MG , of partially ordered sets, we obtain that\n\u03bc\u03c7(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 ),\u03c7(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03bc(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 ),(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) .\nG\nG\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nTaking into account that < ResG\nU (\u03c7)\u03c6 , ResU \u2032\u2032 (\u03c7\u03c1) >=< \u03c6 , ResU \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1) > it follows\nthat\nX\n|U|\nG\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03bc\u03c7(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 ),\u03c7(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) < ResG\n\u03b1(U,ResGU (\u03c7)\u03c6)G (\u03c1) =\nU (\u03c7)\u03c6 , ResU \u2032\u2032 (\u03c7\u03c1) >,\n|G| \u2032 \u2032\nG\n(U ,\u03c6 )\u2208(U,\u03c6) ,\n(U \u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 )\u2286(U \u2032\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032\u2032 )\n\nequals \u03b1(U,\u03c6)G (\u03c1).\n\n\u0003\n\nBy construction, the definition of \u03b8 and the functorial behaviour of Det with respect\nto norm maps and induction ([14, Lem. 9]):\nDetG (\u03bb)(IndGU \u03c7) = DetU (NUG (\u03bb))(\u03c7) = DetU ab (\u03b8U (\u03bb))(\u03c7)\n9\n\n\fwe have thus a commutative diagram\nDetG\n\nK1 (\u039b(G)\n\u03b8\n\n\u0010Q\n\n/\n\nHomGQp , R(\u0393) (R(G), \u039bZp (\u0393)\u00d7 )\n3\nggggg\n\nggg\nBrInd\nggggg\n\nggg\n\n\u000f\n\nab \u00d7\nU \u2208S(G,Z) \u039b(U )\n\nggggg\n\u0011G g\n\u0010Q\nQ\n\n/\n\nDetU ab\n\nO\n\nbrInd\n\n\u00d7\nab\nU \u2208S(G,Z) HomGQp , R(\u0393U ) (R(U ), \u039bZp (\u0393U ) )\n\nwhere brInd is defined in an analogous way as BrInd.\n\n\u0011G\n\n,\n\nQ\nWhile all of Kakde's congruences are among the tuples (xU )U \u2208 U \u2208S(G,Z) \u039b(U ab )\u00d7\nin the work of Ritter and Weiss some are in a similar product (as speculated below,\nbut Ritter and Weiss do not formalise this) and others are expressed within their\nHom-description (over all with the aim to construct an integral logarithm).\nNow we are going to describe the setting of Ritter and Weiss' approach in more\ndetail. First we set QQp (\u0393) := Quot(\u039bZp [[\u0393]]) and note that the homomorphism\nDet( )(\u03c7) : K1 (\u039b(G)S \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 QL (\u0393)\u00d7 \u2286 QQp (\u0393)\nnr\n\nin [RW2, \u00a73] defined using the reduced norm K1 (\u039b(G)S \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 Z(\u039b(G)S \u2217 )\u00d7\ncoincides with \u03a6\u03c7 of [3] by [2, lem. 3.1] and defines a homomorphism\nDet\n\nK1 (\u039b(G)S \u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 HomGQp ,R(\u0393) (R(G), QQp (\u0393)\u00d7 )\ninto the group of GQp - and R(\u0393)-invariant homomorphism, where:\na) \u03c3 \u2208 GQp acts coefficientwise on QQp (\u0393) and R(G),\nb) \u03c6 \u2208 R(\u0393) acts on R(G) via the tensor product \u03c7 7\u2212\u2192 inflG\u0393 (\u03c6)\u03c7 and on QQp (\u0393)\nvia the homomorphism induced by twisting\nT w\u03c6 : \u039bZp (\u0393) \u2212\u2192 \u039bZp (\u0393)\n\u03b3 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(\u03b3)\u03b3.\nIn particular, from RW's construction (see Rem. E in [RW2, \u00a74]):\nkerDet = ker(nr\u039b(G)S \u2217 ) = SK1 (\u039b(G)S \u2217 ).\nBy [14, Lem. 9] Det behaves functorially with respect to open subgroups U \u2286 G and\nthe map included by Induction (IndUG )\u2217 , as well as to factor groups G \u0589 G and the\nmap induced by inflation (infl GG )\u2217 on the Hom-description.\n\n5. The interpolation property versus LF\u221e /F\nBy\nLF\u221e /F (\u03c7) := L\u03c7,\u03a3 =\n\nG\u03c7,\u03a3 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\u2208 QQp (\u0393)\u00d7\nH\u03c7 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n10\n\n\fwe denote the (\u03a3-truncated) p-adic Artin L-function for F cyc /F attached to \u03c7 \u2208\nR(G), for \u03b3 a fixed topological generator of \u0393 [RW2, \u00a74]. Then LF\u221e /F belongs to\nHomGQp ,R(\u0393) (R(G), QQp (\u0393)\u00d7 ) and is independent of choice of \u03b3 (loc. cit. prop. 11).\nApplying the extended localised augmentation map \u03c6\u2032 : QQp (\u0393)\u00d7 \u2212\u2192 Qp \u222a {\u221e},\nwhich is induced by sending any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 to 1, (see before [24, thm. 2.4]) one sees that\ngiving LF\u221e /F is morally the same as requiring the usual interpolation property:\nDet(\u03b6) = LF\u221e /F\nfor some \u03b6 \u2208 K1 (\u039b(G)S \u2217 ) corresponds to\n\u03b6(\u03c7) = \u03c6\u2032 (Det(\u03b6)(\u03c7)) = \u03c6\u2032 (LF\u221e /F (\u03c7)) = L\u03a3 (\u03c7, 1)\nExtending this interpolation property also to the cyclotomic character \u03ba, it even\ndetermines LF\u221e /F uniquely. In fact, Ritter and Weiss show that\n(1)\n\nLF\u221e /F \u2208 HomGO\n\np ,R(\u0393)\n\nwhere\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(R(G), BZp (\u0393)\u00d7 ),\n\nindicates that f satisfies the congruence\nf (\u03c7)p\n\u2261 1 mod p\n\u03a8f (\u03c8p \u03c7)\n\nwith the ring endomorphism \u03a8 : BZp (\u0393) \u2192 BZp (\u0393) being induced by sending \u03b3 to\n\u03b3 p , while \u03c8p : R(G) \u2192 R(G) denotes the pth Adams operator, i.e.,\n(\u03c8p \u03c7)(g) = \u03c7(g p )\nfor any character \u03c7. This result uses twice explicit Brauer induction: Firstly to\ngeneralise a theorem of Snaith [23, thm. 4.1.6] saying that the image of Det lies in\n(1)\nHomGO ,R(\u0393) (R(G), BZp (\u0393)\u00d7 ). Due to the existence of Serre's pseudomeasures which\np\ncan be interpreted as elements in K1 (\u039b(G)S ) for G abelian, it follows that LF\u221e /F\nsatisfies the generalised Snaith congruences. But secondly by explicit Brauer induction the values of LF\u221e /F in the general case can be expressed by the values of\nsuitable abelian L's, hence implying the congruences. In both cases it is crucial that\nthe Brauer induction can be arranged in a compatible way with respect to the pth\nAdams operator, which in general does not behave well under induction.\nTheorem 5.1 ([RW3] Thm. B\u2227 in \u00a76). For G pro-p we have\nDet K1 (B(G)) \u2229 HomGQp , R(\u0393) (R(G), \u039bZp (\u0393)\u00d7 ) \u2282 DetK1 (\u039b(G)).\nin HomGQp , R(\u0393) (R(G)), BZp (\u0393)\u00d7 ).\nThis should be compared to\n\u03a6B \u2229\n\nY\n\n\u039b(U ab )\u00d7 = \u03a6\n\nU \u2208S(G,Z)\n\nin Kakde's work and to Burns' result [2, thm. 6.1, rem. 6.2] - the latter approach\navoids the analysis of integral logarithms.

The proof generalises Wall's proof of (RW3a) by analysing the Leibniz-formula\n\u03a6\nfor determinants; for combinatorial reasons the M\u00f6bius function shows up. Is it by\nchance that this or a similar M\u00f6bius function also shows up in the explicit formula of\nBrauer induction?

Indeed, for every one-dimensional\ncharacter \u03c1 of U (which is trivial on some central subgroup ZU of U) aU (\u03c1) is\nrepresented by \u03c1 itsself under explicit Brauer induction by [1].

Is there a way of proving\nthe next Lemma 6.1 without requiring (RW4)?\nAll what one needs to extend Ritter and Weiss proof of property (9) to Theorem\n6.3 below are the following functoriality properties.\nLemma 6.1. prUV (\u039eU ) = \u039eV and NVU (\u039eU ) = \u039eV as well as similarly prUV (tU ) =\nU\nU\ntV and T\u0303rV (tU ) = tV for all possible U, V \u2208 SG , where the modified trace T\u0303rV is\nintroduced in (10) below.\nProof. While it is well-known that explicit Brauer induction (given by aG as above)\nbehaves well under inflation, it does not behave well under induction. Therefore\nwe need at present condition (RW4) here to prove the correct behaviour under the\nnorm: For V \u2286 U, let\nX\n\u03c1=\nnW IndW\nV \u03c7W\nW \u2286V\n\nin R(V ).

Among those U we may assume\nthat the order of [U : Z(U)] is minimal, where Z(U) denotes the centre of U. Without\nloss of generality we may and do assume that these minimality conditions already\nhold for G itself. Then we choose a central element c \u2208 [G, G] of order p and set\nC :=< c > .

Upon modifying t accordingly, we may and do\nthus assume that\nG\nT\u0303rA (t) = tA .\nas claimed above.\nIn fact, it follows easily that then t is also mapped to tU ab under \u03b2\u0303U for all U such\nthat c is contained in [U, U]. Otherwise we have C \u2229 [U, U] = 1, i.e., the order of\n[U, U] is strictly smaller than that of [G, G], whence\ntU \u2208 T B(U)\nby assumption. We set\nG\n\nxU := xU (t) := T\u0303rU (t) \u2212 tU \u2208 T B(U).\nBy our contraposition the support, i.e., the set\nsupp(t) := {U \u2208 S(G, A)|C \u2229 [U, U] = 1, xU (t) 6= 0},\n20\n\n\fis non-empty for all choices of t satisfying (11). Let t be such a choice with the order\nof supp(t) being minimal and let U \u2208 supp(t) have minimal [U : A]. Explicit calculations with T\u0303r using [21, lem. 5.1], the minimality of [G : Z(G)] and the uniqueness\nof expressing elements in T B(U) as linear combinations over B(Z) similarly as for\nthe proof of \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a8cyc being injective in [22, lem. 3.5] show firstly that U/A must be\ncyclic and secondly that in this cyclic case one can modify t to an element t\u2032 (using\n[21, \u00a76, claim 6.A]) with strictly smaller support than t, a contradiction.\n\u2737\nAt the end we want to investigate whether for \u039b(G) itself instead of B(G) the\ne in terms of \u039b(\u2212) satisfying again (RW1-4) describes, i.e., equals\nanalogous group \u03a6\nthe image of K1 (\u039b(G)). From Kakde's result we know that his condition (M4)\n(together with (M1-M3) at least) imply the M\u00f6bius-Wall congruence (RW3), even\nthough there does not seem to be a direct link between them. For example (M4)\ninvolves only cyclic subgroups while (RW3) ranges over all subgroups among A and\nG. In fact we will now prove the converse, viz that (RW1-4) also implies (M1-4).\nTheorem 6.5.\nK1\u2032 (\u039b(G)) := K1 (\u039b(G))/SK1 (\u039b(G)) \u223c\n= \u03a6\u0303.\nProof.

The map \u03b9 is an isomorphism by (RW3a) (cp. [22, lem. 4.9]) while\n\u03b2\u0303 is an isomorphism by Theorem 6.3 combined with (5) and Lemma 6.4 above. \u0003\nNote that in contrast to Kakde's approach an explicit description of the image of \u03b2\u0303 is\navoided in the above proof. As Kakde pointed out to me such description would be\nvery messy, because the description of the image of \u03b8\u0303 is - among others - in terms of\nthe additive congruences (RW3) which would translate into terms of the logarithm\napplied to them for the image of \u03b2\u0303.\nRecently, also the kernel of LB(G) has been determined by Kakde [7] using the result\nfor abelian G by Ritter and Weiss in [20]:\nker(LB(G) ) = SK1 (B(G)) \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 G ab ,\nwhere\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nSK1 (B(G)) := ker K1 (B(G)) \u2192 K1 (B(G)[ ]) .\np\nHence the same proof as above also shows the following\nTheorem 6.6.\nK1\u2032 (B(G)) := K1 (B(G))/SK1 (B(G)) \u223c\n= \u03a6\u0303B .\n21\n\n\fQuestion: Does an analogous statement hold for A(G)?\nFinally we want to remark that - fixing a central subgroup Z \u223c\n= Zp of G contained\nin \u0393 - we may replace the infinite index sets SG , SGab by the finite subsets\nSG,Z := {U|Z \u2286 U \u2286 G/C for some C E G with C \u2286 H}\n(note that Z can be considered canonically as subgroup of G/C, because Z \u2229 C = 1)\nand\nab\nSG,Z\n:= {U \u2208 SG,Z |U abelian}.\ne we obtain the same statements as in Theorems 6.5 and 6.6.\nFor the corresponding \u03a6\nReferences\n\n[1] R.
