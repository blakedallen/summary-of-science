BONIFACIO, P. MOLARO\nOsservatorio Astronomico di Trieste, Via G.B. Tiepolo 11,\n34131 - Trieste, Italy\nE-mail: bonifaci@ts.astro.it, molaro@ts.astro.it\nThe 8m class telescopes allow for the first time to study stars of external galaxies\nwith the same resolution and S/N ratio which has been so far used for Galactic\nstars. It is quite likely that this study will shake some of our current beliefs.\nIn this poster we highlight some of the results which have been obtained for two\ngiants in the Sgr dSph thanks to the UVES spectrograph on the ESO 8.2m Kueyen\ntelescope. Further details on the observations and data analysis may be found in\nBonifacio et al 1 .\n\n1\n\nResults\n\nThe two stars turned out to be rather metal-rich with [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.3. This was\nsomewhat a surprise since the stars have roughly the same V \u2212I colour but differ in V by 0.18 mag and were thought to be representative of the spread in Sgr\nRGB which common\u2013wisdom has attributed to a spread in metallicity2,3,4,5,6,7 .\nGiven the steepness of the RGB in this colour range it may well be that the two\nstars lie in fact on the same isochrone and their V \u2212 I colours are different but\nphotometric errors of \u2248 0.04 mag make them equal. However there is another\npossible explanation whose consequences are rather intriguing and cannot be\neasily discarded: the two stars have a different distance. A difference of about\n2 kpc would be enough to explain the difference in V mag. This value is not\nunreasonable since Ibata et al 5 estimate a line\u2013of\u2013sight depth of about 1.2 kpc.\nFrom our spectra we may find evidence which further supports this possibility:\nthe Na I D lines of the brighter star, # 143, appear perfectly symmetric with\nno hint of the presence of interstellar components at the radial velocity of Sgr,\nwhile the fainter star, # 139, shows a weak but definite asymmetry in both Na\nI D lines, which may be interpreted as due to interstellar material associated\nwith Sgr.\nThe high metallicity found for both stars implies that Sgr has undergone a\nhigh level of chemical processing; it also suggests that a sizeable population of\nSgr is this metal\u2013rich. The abundance pattern is interesting, although most of\nthe elements with A \u2264 39 are consistent within error with the solar ratio, taken\nat face value they are all slightly sub-solar. On the other hand Ba and more\nmassive elements show over-solar ratios. The pattern may be summarized as\n1\n\n\ffollows: Na and Sc are over-deficient with respect to iron by about 0.4 dex;\nheavy neutron\u2013capture elements Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Eu are over\u2013abundant with\nrespect to iron by 0.3 to 0.5 dex; Y is over-deficient with respect to iron by\nabout 0.4 dex.\nIt is interesting to compare the abundances of these two Sgr giants with\nthose obtained by Shetrone et al 8 for three other Local Group Galaxies (Draco,\nUrsa Minor and Sextans). One should also keep in mind that Sagittarius is\nconsiderably more massive than the other three galaxies and this is, perhaps,\nthe key to understand its high\u2013metallicity population. The [Mg/Fe] ratio seems\nto drop, with increasing [Fe/H], faster in Local Group Galaxies than it does\nin the Galactic Halo or disk and this could be the signature of a very low\nor episodic star formation. It shall be very interesting to see what is the\n[Mg/Fe] ratio of the metal\u2013poor population of Sagittarius, when its existence\nis confirmed. Damped Lyman \u03b1 systems, observed in absorption in the line\u2013of\u2013\nsight of QSO's have metallicities in the range -2,-1 and show [\u03b1/Fe] ratios which\nare solar 9,10 . Could Damped Lyman \u03b1 systems be linked to dwarf galaxies ?\nThis possibility is appealing, although these galaxies are now devoid of gas,\nthey must have been relatively rich in gas when the stars we observe now were\nformed.\nThe over-deficiency of Na seems a common occurrence in Local Group\ngalaxies, although there is no definite trend and a large scatter. On the\nother hand Y is always over-deficient with very few exceptions and this overdeficiency is mirrored by an overabundance of heavy elements.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nBonifacio P., et al A&A 359, 66 (2000)\nIbata R.A., Gilmore G., Irwin M.J.
