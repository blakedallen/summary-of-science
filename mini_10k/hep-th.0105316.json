INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently one has proposed a new method of construction of exact solutions of the Einstein equations on (pseudo)\nRiemannian spaces of three, four and extra dimensions (in brief, 3D, 4D,...), by applying the formalism of anholonomic moving frames [1]. There were constructed static solutions for black holes / tori, soliton\u2013dilaton systems and\nwormhole / flux tube configurations and for anisotropic generalizations of the Taub NUT metric [2]; all such solutions\nbeing, in general, with generic local anisotropy. The method was elaborated following the geometry of anholonomic\nframe (super) bundles and associated nonlinear connections (in brief, N\u2013connection) [3,4] which has a number of\napplications in generalized Finsler and Lagrange geometry, anholonomic spinor geometry, (super) gravity and strings\nwith anisotropic (anholonomic) frame structures.\nIn this paper we restrict our considerations for the 5D Einstein gravity. In this case the N\u2013connection coefficients\nare defined by some particular parametrizations of funfbein, or pentadic, coefficients defining a frame structure on\n(pseudo) Riemannian spacetime and describing a gravitational and matter field dynamics with mixed holonomic\n(unconstrained) and anholonomic (constrained) variables. We emphasize that the Einstein gravity theory in arbitrary\ndimensions can be equivalently formulated with respect to both holonomic (coordinate) and anholonomic frames. In\nthe anholonomic cases the rules of partial and covariant derivation are modified by some pentad transforms. The\npoint is to find such values of the anholonomic frame (and associated N\u2013connection) coefficients when the metric is\ndiagonalized and the Einstein equations are written in a simplified form admitting exact solutions.\nThe class of new exact solutions of vacuum Einstein equations describing anisotropic Taub NUT like spacetimes\n[2] is defined by off\u2013diagonal metrics if they are given with respect to usual coordinate bases. Such metrics can be\nanholonomically transformed into diagonal ones with coefficients being very similar to the coefficients of the isotropic\nTaub NUT solution but having additional dependencies on the 5th coordinate and angular parameters.\nWe shall use the term locally anisotropic (spacetime) space (in brief, anisotropic space) for a (pseudo) Riemannian\nspace provided with an anholonomic frame structure induced by a procedure of anholonomic diagonalization of a\noff\u2013diagonal metric.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Hawking's [5] suggestion that the Euclidean Taub-NUT metric might give rise to the gravitational analogue\nof the Yang\u2013Mills instanton holds true on anisotropic spaces but in this case both the metric and instanton have\nsome anisotropically renormalized parameters being of higher dimension gravitational vacuum polarization origin.\nThe anisotropic Euclidean Taub-NUT metric also satisfies the vacuum Einstein's equations with zero cosmological\nconstant when the spherical symmetry is deformed, for instance, into ellipsoidal or even toroidal configuration. Such\nanisotropic Taub-NUT metrics can be used for generation of deformations of the space part of the line element defining\nan anisotropic modification of the Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions proposed by Gross and Perry [6] and Sorkin [7].\nIn the long-distance limit, neglecting radiation, the relative motion of two such anisotropic monopoles can be also\ndescribed by geodesic motions, like in Ref. [8], but these motions are some anholonomic ones with associated nonlinear\nconnection structure and effective torsion induced by the anholonomy of the systems of reference used for modelling\nanisotropies. The torsion and N\u2013connection corrections vanish if the geometrical objects are transferred with respect\nto holonomic (coordinate) frames.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the new anholonomic geometry of anisotropic Taub-NUT spaces is also\nvery interesting. In the locally isotropic Taub-NUT geometry there are four Killing-Yano tensors [9]. Three of\nthem form a complex structure realizing the quaternionic algebra and the Taub-NUT manifold is hyper-K\u00e4hler. In\naddition to such three vector-like Killing-Yano tensors, there is a scalar one which exists by virtue of the metric\nbeing of class D, according to Petrov's classification. Anisotropic deformations of metrics to off\u2013diagonal components\nintroduce substantial changes in the geometrical picture. Nevertheless, working with respect to anholonomic frames\nwith associated nonlinear connection structure the basic properties and relations, even being anisotropically modified,\nare preserved and transformed to similar ones for deformed symmetries [2].\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger quantum modes in the Euclidean Taub-NUT geometry were analyzed using algebraic and analytical\nmethods [9,10]. The Dirac equation was studied in such locally isotropic curved backgrounds [11]. One of the aims\nof this paper is to prove that this approach can be developed as to include into consideration anisotropic Taub-NUT\nbackgrounds in the context of the standard relativistic gauge-invariant theory [15,16] of the Dirac field.\nThe purpose of the present work is to develop a general SO(4, 1) gauge-invariant theory of the Dirac fermions [12]\nwhich can be considered for locally anisotropic spaces, for instance, in the external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole\n[11] which is anisotropically deformed.\nOur goal is also to point out new features of the Einstein theory in higher dimension spacetime when the locally\nanisotropic properties, induced by anholonomic constraints and extra dimension gravity, are emphasized. We shall\nanalyze such effects by constructing new classes of exact solutions of the Einstein\u2013Dirac equations defining 3D soliton\u2013\nspinor configurations propagating self\u2013consistently in an anisotropic 5D Taub NUT spacetime.\nWe note that in this paper the 5D spacetime is modeled as a direct time extension of a 4D Riemannian space\nprovided with a corresponding spinor structure, i. e. our spinor constructions are not defined by some Clifford algebra\nassociated to a 5D bilinear form but, for simplicity, they are considered to be extended from a spinor geometry defined\nfor a 4D Riemannian space.\nWe start in Section II with an introduction in the Einstein\u2013Dirac theory formulated with respect to anholonomic\nframes with associated nonlinear connection structure. We write down the Einstein and Dirac equations for some\nclasses of metric ansatz which can be diagonalized via anholonomic transforms to a locally anisotropic basis. In\nSection III we construct exact solutions for 3D Dirac wave packets propagating in anisotropic backgrounds. In\nSection IV we outline two classes of 5D locally anisotropic solutions of vacuum Einstein equations generalizing the\nwell known Taub NUT metric for the cases of anisotropic (angular and/or extra dimension) polarizations of constants\nand metric coefficients. Section V is devoted to such solutions of the 5D Einstein \u2013 Dirac equations which are\nconstructed as generalizations of Taub NUT anisotropic vacuum metrics to configurations with Dirac spinor energy\u2013\nmomentum source. In Section VI we prove that the Dirac spinor field in such anisotropic spacetimes can also induce\n3D dimensional solitons which can treated as an anisotropic, in general, non\u2013trivially typological, soliton\u2013Dirac wave\npacket configuration propagating self\u2013consistently in anisotropically deformed Taub NUT spacetime. Finally, in\nSection VII we conclude the work.\nII. EINSTEIN\u2013DIRAC EQUATIONS WITH ANHOLONOMIC VARIABLES\n\nIn this Section we introduce an ansatz for pseudo Riemannian off\u2013diagonal metrics and consider the anholonomic\ntransforms diagonalizing such metrics. The system of field Einstein equations with the spinor matter energy\u2013\nmomentum tensor and of Dirac equations are formulated on 5D pseudo\u2013Riemannian spacetimes constructed as a\ntrivial extension by the time variable of a 4D Riemannian space (an anisotropic deformation of the Taub NUT\ninstanton [2]).\n\n2\n\n\fA.

TAUB NUT SOLUTIONS WITH GENERIC LOCAL ANISOTROPY\n\nThe Kaluza-Klein monopole [6,7] was obtained by embedding the Taub-NUT gravitational instanton into fivedimensional theory, adding the time coordinate in a trivial way. There are anisotropic variants of such solutions [2]\nwhen anisotropies are modelled by effective polarizations of the induced magnetic field. The aim of this Section is to\nanalyze such Taub\u2013NUT solutions for both cases of locally isotropic and locally anisotropic configurations.\nA. A conformal transform of the Taub NUT metric\n\nWe consider the Taub NUT solutions and introduce a conformal transformation and a such redefinition of variables\nwhich will be useful for further generalizations to anisotropic vacuum solutions.\n8\n\n\f1.

The spacetime defined by (42) has the global\nsymmetry of the group Gs = SO(3) \u2297 U4 (1) \u2297 Tt (1) since the line element is invariant under the global rotations of\nthe Cartesian space coordinates and y 4 and t translations of the Abelian groups U4 (1) and Tt (1) respectively. We\nnote that the U4 (1) symmetry eliminates the so called NUT singularity if y 4 has the period 4\u03c0m0 .\n2. Conformally transformed Taub NUT metrics\n\nWith the aim to construct anisotropic generalizations it is more convenient to introduce a new 5th coordinate,\nZ\ny 4 \u2192 \u03c2 = y 4 \u2212 \u03bc\u22121 (\u03b8, \u03c6)d\u03be(\u03b8, \u03c6),\n(44)\nwith the property that\nd\u03c2 + 4m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)d\u03b8 = dy 4 + 4m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)d\u03c6,\nwhich holds for\nd\u03be = \u03bc(\u03b8, \u03c6)d(\u03c2 \u2212 y 4 ) =\n\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03be\nd\u03b8 +\nd\u03c6,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\nwhen\n\u2202\u03be\n= 4m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\u03bc,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03be\n= \u22124m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\u03bc,\n\u2202\u03c6\nand, for instance,\n\u03bc = (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\n\n\u22122\n\nexp[\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6].\n\nThe changing of coordinate (44) describe a reorientation of the 5th coordinate in a such way as we could have only\none nonvanishing component of the electromagnetic potential\nA\u03b8 = 4m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) .\nThe next step is to perform a conformal transform,\n9\n\n\fs2(4D) = V ds2(4D)\nds2(4D) \u2192 db\nand to consider the 5D metric\ns2(4D) ;\nds2(5D) = dt2 + db\ndb\ns2(4D)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(45)\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= \u2212(dr + r d\u03b8 ) \u2212 r sin \u03b8d\u03c6\n\u2212V 2 (d\u03b6 + A\u03b8 d\u03b8)2 ,\n\n(not being an exact solution of the Einstein equations) which will transform into some exact solutions after corresponding anholonomic transforms.\nHere, we emphasize that we chose the variant of transformation of a locally isotropic non\u2013Einsteinian metrics into an\nanisotropic one solving the vacuum Einstein equations in order to illustrate a more simple procedure of construction\nof 5D vacuum metrics with generic local anisotropy. As a metter of principle we could remove vacuum isotropic\nsolutions into vacuum anisotropic ones, but the formula in this case would became very combersome.. The fact of\nselection as an isotropic 4D Riemannian background just the metric from the linear interval db\ns2(4D) can be treated as\na conformal transformation of an instanton solution which is anisotropically deformed and put trivially (by extension\nto the time like coordinate) into a 5D metric as to generate a locally isotropic vacuum gravitational field.\nB. Anisotropic Taub NUT solutions with magnetic polarization\n\nWe outline two classes of exact solutions of 5D vacuum Einstein equations with generic anisotropies (see details in\nRef. [2]) which will be extended to configurations with spinor matter field source.\n1.

We can verify that the data\nx0 = t, x1 = r, x2 = \u03b8, y 3 = s = \u03c6, y 4 = \u03c2,\ng0 = 1, g1 = \u22121, g2 = \u2212r2 , h3 = \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8,\n2\n2\nh4 = V 2 (r) \u03b7(\u03c6)\n, \u03b7(\u03c6)\n= [1 + \u031f(r, \u03b8)\u03c6]2 , wi = 0;\n\n(46)\n\nn0,1 = 0; n2 = n2[0] (r, \u03b8) + n2[1] (r, \u03b8) /[1 + \u031f(r, \u03b8)\u03c6]2 .\ngive an exact solution. If we impose the condition to obtain in the locally isotropic limit just the metric (45), we have\nto choose the arbitrary functions from the general solution of (21) as to have\n2\n= [1 + \u031f(r, \u03b8)\u03c6]2 \u2192 1 for \u031f(r, \u03b8)\u03c6 \u2192 0.\n\u03b7(\u03c6)\n\nFor simplicity, we can analyze only angular anisotropies with \u031f = \u031f(\u03b8), when\n2\n2\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = [1 + \u031f(\u03b8)\u03c6]2 .\n= \u03b7(\u03c6)\n\u03b7(\u03c6)\n\nIn the locally isotropic limit of the solution for n2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), when \u031f\u03c6 \u2192 0, we could obtain the particular magnetic\nconfiguration contained in the metric (45) if we impose the condition that\nn2[0] (r, \u03b8) + n2[1] (r, \u03b8) = A\u03b8 = 4m0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) ,\n10\n\n\fwhich defines only one function from two unknown values n2[0] (r, \u03b8) and n2[1] (r, \u03b8) . This could have a corresponding\nphysical motivation. From the usual Kaluza\u2013Klein procedure we induce the 4D gravitational field (metric) and 4D\nelectromagnetic field (potentials Ai ), which satisfy the Maxwell equations in 4D pseudo\u2013Riemannian spacetime. For\nthe case of spherical, locally isotropic, symmetries the Maxwell equations can be written for vacuum magnetic fields\nwithout any polarizations. When we introduce into consideration anholonomic constraints and locally anisotropic\ngravitational configurations the effective magnetic field could be effectively renormalized by higher dimension gravitational field. This effect, for some classes of anisotropies, can be modeled by considering that the constant m0 is\npolarized,\nm0 \u2192 m (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = m0 \u03b7m (r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nfor the electromagnetic potential and resulting magnetic field. For \"pure\" angular anisotropies we write that\nn2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) = n2[0] (\u03b8) + n2[1] (\u03b8) /[1 + \u031f(\u03b8)\u03c6]2\n= 4m0 \u03b7m (\u03b8, \u03c6) (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) ,\nfor\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03b8) /[1 + \u031f(\u03b8)\u03c6]2 .\n(\u03b8) + \u03b7(\u03c6)[1]\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03b7(\u03c6)[0]\n\u03b7(\u03c6)\n\nThis could result in a constant angular renormalization even \u031f(\u03b8)\u03c6 \u2192 0.\n2. Solutions with extra\u2013dimension induced polarization\n\nAnother class of solutions is constructed if we consider a d\u2013metric of the type (6), when s = \u03c2, with anisotropic\ndependence on the 5th coordinate \u03c2,\n\u03b4s2 = dt2 \u2212 \u03b4s2(4D) ,\n\u03b4s2(4D) = \u2212(dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 ) \u2212 r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n2\n\u2212V 2 (r)\u03b7(\u03c2)\n(\u03b8, \u03c2)\u03b4\u03c2 2 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c2 = d\u03c2 + w3 (\u03b8, \u03c2)d\u03b8,\nwhere, for simplicity, we omit possible anisotropies on variable r, i. e. we state that \u03b7(\u03c2) and w2 are not functions of\nr.\nThe data for a such solution are\nx0 = t, x1 = r, x2 = \u03b8, y 3 = s = \u03c2, y 4 = \u03c6,\ng0 = 1, g1 = \u22121, g2 = \u2212r2 , h4 = \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8,\n2\n2\n2\nh3 = V 2 (r) \u03b7(\u03c2)\n, \u03b7(\u03c2)\n= \u03b7(\u03c2)\n(r, \u03b8, \u03c2), n0,1 = 0;\n\n(47)\n\nw0,1 = 0, w2 = 4m0 \u03b7m (\u03b8, \u03c2) (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) , n0 = 0,\nZ\n\u22123\nn1,2 = n1,2[0] (r, \u03b8) + n1,2[1] (r, \u03b8) \u03b7(\u03c2)\n(r, \u03b8, \u03c2)d\u03c2,\nwhere the function \u03b7(\u03c2) = \u03b7(\u03c2) (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) is an arbitrary one as follow for the case h\u22174 = 0, for angular polarizations we\nstate, for simplicity, that \u03b7(\u03c2) does not depend on r, i. e. \u03b7(\u03c2) = \u03b7(\u03c2) (\u03b8, \u03c2).

The first solution (49), for negative\ndensities of energy should be excluded as unphysical, the second solution (50) is just that from (46) for the vacuum\ncase. A new interesting physical situation is described by the solution (51) when we obtain a Taub NUT anisotropic\nmetric with periodic anisotropic dependencies on the angle \u03c6 where the periodicity could variate on coordinates (r, \u03b8)\nas it is defined by the energy density \u03a5 (r, \u03b8) . For simplicity, we can consider a package of spinor waves with constant\nvalue of \u03a5 = \u03a50 and fix some boundary and coordinate conditions when C1,2 = C1,2[0] are constant. This type of\nanisotropic Taub NUT solutions are described by a d\u2013metric coefficient\np\n2\ncos2 [\u03c6r sin \u03b8 \u03a50 + C2[0] ].\nh4 = V 2 (r)C1[0]\n(52)\nPutting this value into the formulas (24), (25) and (26) for coefficients in equations (22) we can express \u03b11,2 =\n\u03b11,2 [h3 , h4 , \u03a50 ] and \u03b2 = \u03b2[h3 , h4 , \u03a50 ] (we omit these rather simple but cumbersome formulas) and in consequence we\ncan define the values w1,2 by solving linear algebraic equations:\nw1,2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03b11,2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) /\u03b2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) .\nHaving defined the values (52) it is a simple task of two integrations on \u03c6 in order to define\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n1 + cos \u03ba\u0303\n+\n+\nn2 = n2[0] (r, \u03b8) ln\n1 \u2212 cos \u03ba\u0303 1 \u2212 cos \u03ba\u0303 1 \u2212 sin \u03ba\u0303\n+n2[1] (r, \u03b8) ,\n\n(53)\n\nwere\n\u03ba\u0303 = \u03c6r sin \u03b8\n\np\n\u03a50 + C2[0] ,\n\nn2[0,1] (r, \u03b8) are some arbitrary functions to be defined by boundary conditions. We put n0,1 = 0 to obtain in the\nvacuum limit the solution (46).\n12\n\n\fFinally, we can summarize the data defining an exact solution for an anisotropic (on angle \u03c6) Dirac wave packet \u2013\nTaub NUT configuration:\nx0 = t, x1 = r, x2 = \u03b8, y 3 = s = \u03c6, y 4 = \u03c2,\ng0 = 1, g1 = \u22121, g2 = \u2212r2 , h3 = \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8,\n2\nh4 = V 2 (r) \u03b7(\u03c6)\n, \u03b7(\u03c6) = C1 (r, \u03b8) cos \u03ba\u0303(r, \u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(54)\n\nwi = 0, n0,1 = 0, n2 = n2 (r, \u03b8, \u03ba\u0303(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)) see (53),\n\u0001\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(+) \u03b6 1,2 (x1 , x2 ) see (39),\n\u0001\n\u03a5 = \u03a5 \u03b6 1,2 (x1 , x2 ) see (40).\n\nThis solution will be extended to additional soliton anisotropic configurations in the next Section.\nB. Dirac fields and extra dimension polarizations\n\nNow we consider a generalization of the data (47) for generation of a new solution, with generic local anisotropy on\nextra dimension 5th coordinate, of the Einstein \u2013 Dirac equations. Following the equation (22) we conclude that there\nare not nonvacuum solutions of the Einstein equations (with \u03a5 6= 0) if h\u22174 = 0 which impose the condition \u03a5 = 0 for\nh3 , h4 6= 0. So, we have to consider that the d\u2013metric component h4 = \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8 from the data (47) is generalized to\na function h4 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) satisfying a second order nonlinear differential equation on variable \u03c2 with coefficients depending\nparametrically on coordinates (r, \u03b8) . The equation (i. e. (22)) can be linearized (see Ref. [17]) if we introduce a new\nvariable h4 = h2 ,\nh\u2217\u2217 \u2212\n\nh\u22173 \u2217\nh + h3 \u03a5h = 0,\n2h3\n\nwhich, in its turn, can be transformed :\na) to a Riccati form if we introduce a new variable v, for which h = v \u2217 /v,\nv\u2217 + v2 \u2212\n\nh\u22173\nv + h3 \u03a5 = 0;\n2h3\n\n(55)\n\nb) to the so\u2013called normal form [17],\n\u03bb\u2217\u2217 + I\u03bb = 0,\n\n(56)\n\nobtained by a redefinition of variables like\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u03bb = h exp \u2212\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\nh\u22173\n\u22121/4\nd\u03c2 = h h3\nh3\n\nwhere\nI = h3 \u03a5 \u2212\n\n1 h\u22173\n1\n+\n16 h3\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u22173\nh3\n\n\u0013\u2217\n\n.\n\nWe can construct explicit series and/or numeric solutions (for instance, by using Mathematica or Maple programs)\nof both type of equations (55) and normal (56) for some stated boundary conditions and type of polarization of the\n2\ncoefficient h3 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) = V 2 (r) \u03b7(\u03c2)\n(r, \u03b8, \u03c2) and, in consequence, to construct different classes of solutions for h4 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) .\nIn order to have compatibility with the data (47) we must take h4 in the form\nh4 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) = \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8 + h4(\u03c2) (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) ,\nwhere h4(\u03c2) (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) vanishes for \u03a5 \u2192 0.\nHaving defined a value of h4 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) we can compute the coefficients (24), (25) and (26) and find from the equations\n(22)\nw1,2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) = \u03b11,2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) /\u03b2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) .\n13\n\n\fFrom the equations (23), after two integrations on variable \u03c2 one obtains the values of n1,2 (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) . Two integrations\nof equations (23) define\nZ \u03c2 Z z\ndsP (r, \u03b8, s) + ni[1] (r, \u03b8),\ndz\nni (r, \u03b8, \u03c2) = ni[0] (r, \u03b8)\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere\nP \u2261\n\nh\u2217\n1 h\u22173\n\u2212 3 4)\n(\n2 h3\nh4\n\nand the functions ni[0] (r, \u03b8) and ni[1] (r, \u03b8) on (r, \u03b8) have to be defined by solving the Cauchy problem. The boundary\nconditions of both type of coefficients w1,2 and n1,2 should be expressed in some forms transforming into corresponding\nvalues for the data (47) if the source \u03a5 \u2192 0. We omit explicit formulas for exact Einstein\u2013Dirac solutions with \u03c2\u2013\npolarizations because their forms depend very strongly on the type of polarizations and vacuum solutions.\nVI. ANHOLONOMIC SOLITON\u2013TAUB NUT\u2013DIRAC FIELDS\n\nIn the next subsections we analyze two explicit examples when the spinor field induces two dimensional, depending\non three variables, solitonic anisotropies.\nA. Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili type solitons\n\nBy straightforward verification we conclude that the d\u2013metric component h4 (r, \u03b8, s) could be a solution of\nKadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili (KdP) equation [18] (the first methods of integration of 2+1 dimensional soliton equations\nwhere developed by Dryuma [19] and Zakharov and Shabat [20])\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nh\u2217\u2217\n= 0, \u01eb = \u00b11,\n(57)\n4 + \u01eb \u1e234 + 6h4 h4 + h4\nif the component h3 (r, \u03b8, s) satisfies the Bernoulli equations [17]\nh\u22173 + Y (r, \u03b8, s) (h3 )2 + F\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s) h3 = 0,\nwhere, for\n\nh\u22174\n\n(58)\n\n6= 0,\nY (r, \u03b8, s) = \u03ba\u03a5\n\nand\nF\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s) =\n\nh4\n,\nh\u22174\n\n(59)\n\n\u0011\u2032\n2\u01eb \u0010\nh\u22174\n+ \u2217 \u1e234 + 6h4 h\u20324 + h\u2032\u2032\u2032\n.\n4\nh4\nh4\n\nThe three dimensional integral variety of (58) is defined by formulas\n\u0001\n\u22121\ni\nh\u22121\n3 (r, \u03b8, s) = h3(x) (r, \u03b8) E\u01eb x , s \u00d7\nwhere\nE\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s) = exp\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nY (r, \u03b8, s)\nds,\nE\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s)\n\nF\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s) ds\n\nand h3(x) (r, \u03b8) is a nonvanishing function.\nIn the vacuum case Y (r, \u03b8, s) = 0 and we can write the integral variety of (58)\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n(vac)\n(vac)\nh3\n(r, \u03b8, s) = h3(x) (r, \u03b8) exp \u2212 F\u01eb (r, \u03b8, s) ds .\nWe conclude that a solution of KdP equation (58) could be generated by a non\u2013perturbative component h4 (r, \u03b8, s)\nof a diagonal h\u2013metric if the second component h3 (r, \u03b8, s) is a solution of Bernoulli equations (58) with coefficients\ndetermined both by h4 and its partial derivatives and by the \u03a511 component of the energy\u2013momentum d\u2013tensor (see\n(41)). The parameters (coefficients) of (2+1) dimensional KdP solitons are induced by gravity and spinor constants\nand spinor waves coefficients defining locally anisotropic interactions of packets of Dirac's spinor waves.\n14\n\n\fB. (2+1) sine\u2013Gordon type solitons\n\nIn a similar manner we can prove that solutions h4 (r, \u03b8, s) of (2+1) sine\u2013Gordon equation (see, for instance, [21\u201323])\n\u2032\u2032\n\nh\u2217\u2217\n4 + h4 \u2212 \u1e274 = sin(h4 )\nalso induce solutions for h3 (r, \u03b8, s) following from the Bernoulli equation\nh\u22173 + \u03baE(r, \u03b8)\n\nh4\n(h3 )2 + F (r, \u03b8, s) h3 = 0, h\u22174 6= 0,\nh\u22174\n\nwhere\nF (r, \u03b8, s) =\n\ni\n2 h \u2032\u2032\nh\u22174\n+ \u2217 h4 \u2212 \u1e274 \u2212 sin(h4 ) .\nh4\nh4\n\nThe general solutions (with energy\u2013momentum sources and in vacuum cases) are constructed by a corresponding\nredefinition of coefficients in the formulas from the previous subsection. We note that we can consider both type of\nanisotropic solitonic polarizations, depending on angular variable \u03c6 or on extra dimension coordinate \u03c2. Such classes\nof solutions of the Einstein\u2013Dirac equations describe three dimensional spinor wave packets induced and moving self\u2013\nconsistently on solitonic gravitational locally anisotropic configurations. In a similar manner, we can consider Dirac\nwave packets generating and propagating on locally anisotropic black hole (with rotation ellipsoid horizons), black\ntori, anisotropic disk and two or three dimensional black hole anisotropic gravitational structures [1]. Finally, we note\nthat such gravitational solitons are induced by Dirac field matter sources and are different from those soliton solutions\nof vacuum Einstein equations originally considered by Belinski and Zakharov [24].\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have argued that the anholonomic frame method can be applied for construction on new classes of Einstein\u2013Dirac\nequations in five dimensional (5D) spacetimes. Subject to a form of metric ansatz with dependencies of coefficients on\ntwo holonomic and one anholonomic variables we obtained a very simplified form of field equations which admit exact\nsolutions. We have identified two classes of solutions describing Taub NUT like metrics with anisotropic dependencies\non angular parameter or on the fifth coordinate. We have shown that both classes of anisotropic vacuum solutions\ncan be generalized to matter sources with the energy\u2013momentum tensor defined by some wave packets of Dirac fields.\nAlthough the Dirac equation is a quantum one, in the quasi\u2013classical approximation we can consider such spinor fields\nas some spinor waves propagating in a three dimensional Minkowski plane which is imbedded in a self\u2013consistent\nmanner in a Taub\u2013NUT anisotropic spacetime. At the classical level it should be emphasized that the results of this\npaper are very general in nature, depending in a crucial way only on the locally Lorentzian nature of 5D spacetime and\non the supposition that this spacetime is constructed as a trivial time extension of 4D spacetimes. We have proved that\nthe new classes of solutions admit generalizations to nontrivial topological configurations of 3D dimensional solitons\n(induced by anisotropic spinor matter) defined as solutions Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili or sine\u2013Gordon equations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank M.
