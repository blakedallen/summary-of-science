Associations span tens of parsecs and are defined by the molecular cloud complexes\nfrom which their constituent stars form; some examples are the T association in\nthe Taurus molecular cloud, and the extensive association of OB stars interacting\nwith the Orion molecular clouds. Within these molecular clouds, star formation\nis typically not widespread, but concentrated into distinct, parsec\u2013sized groups\nand clusters with memberships ranging from ten stars to a thousand stars1 . The\nstars in associations and clusters are not formed simultaneously in a single star\nforming event, but over a span of 1 Myr in clusters (Palla & Stahler 2000), and\na span of several to 10 Myr in associations (Brice\u00f1o et al. 2001). The immediate\n1\n\nSince systems of more than 100 young stars may persist as gravitationally bound open clusters,\nAdam & Myers (2001) define clusters as systems of more than 100 stars, and groups as systems\ncontaining less than 100 stars.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMegeath et al.\n\nimplication of both the non-isolated and non-coeval nature of star formation is\nthat the formation of stars can be affected by winds, radiation, and outflows\nfrom previous generations of stars.\nOB stars have the most dramatic influence on star formation. These stars\nboth ionize and photodissociate molecular clouds with their intense UV radiation\nand sweep up atomic and molecular gas with winds, ionization fronts, and \u2013 at\nthe end of their lives \u2013 supernovae. In particular, stars with spectral types of\nB2 or earlier produce enough UV radiation to effectively ionize cluster\u2013forming\nmolecular cores. Since OB stars are relatively rare, it is important to assess\ntheir importance by examining unbiased near\u2013IR surveys of molecular clouds.\nIn an analysis of the 2MASS 2nd incremental release data covering the Perseus,\nMonR2, Orion A and Orion B clouds, Carpenter (2000) found a total of 1200\nisolated stars, 200 stars in eight groups, and 2900 stars in six clusters. Hence,\nthe majority of the stars in these clouds formed in clusters containing 100 or\nmore stars. In the sample, four of the clusters, GGD12-15, Mon R2, NGC 2024\n& the Orion Nebula Cluster, contain at least one star with a spectral type of B2\nor earlier. One of the groups, NGC 20682 , contains a B1.5 star. In total, 57% of\nthe stars detected in the studied regions are in close proximity to ionizing OB\nstars. This number is a lower limit since it only counts OB stars which form\nwithin clusters. As we will demonstrate, external OB stars may also influence\nthe formation of clusters.\nIn this paper, we discuss how massive stars influence the process of cluster\nformation on sizescales ranging from 0.1 pc to 300 pc, with a particular emphasis\non our own study of the NGC 281 region. We start by examining the disruption\nof cluster\u2013forming molecular cores by nascent OB stars within the cluster. As we\ndemonstrated above, the majority of observed young clusters appear to contain\nOB stars. We then study the disruption of cluster forming cores by neighboring\nOB stars, which are situated a few parsecs away from the star forming region.\nThis case occurs during the formation of an OB association, when OB stars which\nhave dispersed their own parental cores begin to ionize neighboring star forming\ncores. Finally, we discuss a possible case of supernova driven star formation,\nwhere the influence of OB stars extends beyond the boundaries of molecular\ncloud complexes to distances of a few hundred parsecs.\n2.\n\nCore Destruction by Internal OB Stars (< 1 pc)\n\nThe birth sites of massive stars are 1000 M\u2299 dense molecular cores with densities\nof 105 cm\u22123 and sizes of 1 pc (Plume et al. 1997). Within these cores, entire\nclusters of lower\u2013mass stars form. OB stars still embedded within their parental\ncores are thought to form ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIs), HII regions with\nsizes of < 0.1 pc and electron densities > 104 cm\u22123 . This picture is supported by\nthe growing number of observations showing UCHIIs surrounded by embedded\nclusters of lower\u2013mass stars (Megeath et al. 1996; Tapia, Persi & Roth 1996;\n2\n\nOur classification of NGC 2068 as a group is due to the partial coverage of this region in the 2nd\nincremental release of the 2MASS data. While Carpenter finds only 45 stars in the incomplete\n2MASS data, Lada (1989) reports 192 stars in the region, indicating that NGC 2068 should be\nclassified as a cluster.\n\n\fImpact of Massive Stars\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\n2nd Generation Digital Sky Survey, red band image of the\nNGC 281 Nebula and IC 1590 Cluster. The primary ionizing star is\nHD 5005, an O5.5 star. The eastern side of the nebula shows numerous\nbright rimmed globules, but the most active region of ongoing star\nformation is the obscured IR cluster towards the southwestern quadrant\nof the nebula.\nPratap, Megeath & Bergin 1999). After OB stars dissipate their parental dense\ncores, the HII regions expand and are no longer classified as UCHIIs (Tieftrunk\net al. 1997). Hence, the lifetime of UCHIIs is the time required for young OB\nstars, once they have formed, to destroy their parental cores and terminate the\nprocess of cluster formation.\nThe best current estimates of the lifetimes of UCHIIs are based on empirical arguments. Wood & Churchwell (1989) found that UCHIIs can be identified\non the basis of their IRAS colors. By comparing the number of IRAS identified UCHIIs in the Galaxy with the observed number of OB stars in the solar\nneighborhood, they estimated a lifetime of 0.5 Myr. By eliminating lower\u2013mass\nstars contaminating the IRAS sample, as well as taking into account variations\nin the density of UCHIIs with galactic radius, this lifetime has been revised by\nComeron & Torra (1996) and Casassus et al. (2000) to 0.05 \u2212 0.1 Myr.\nThe estimated UCHII lifetimes indicate that once an OB star is formed in a\ncluster forming core, the core destruction occurs on a timescale of 0.1 Myr. Since\nthe timescale for cluster formation is ten times longer, 1 Myr (Palla & Stahler\n2000), only 1/10 of the forming clusters should contain ultracompact HII regions.\nInterestingly, in the combined surveys of W3 (Tieftrunk et al. 1998), Perseus,\nOrion A, Mon R2 (Carpenter 2000) & Orion B (Lada 1992), 4/10 of the clusters\ncontain UCHIIs: Mon R2, W3 OH, W3 Main, and GGD12-15. Although the\n\n\f4\n\nMegeath et al.\n\nFigure 2.\nGreyscale: 2 \u03bcm image of the NGC 281 West cluster.\nDotted contours: 20 cm VLA data tracing the ionized gas.

Note that the cluster is divided into northern and southern\nsub-cluster.\nratio is four times that expected, the current sample of molecular clouds is small.\nA larger sample is needed to firmly establish the fraction of star\u2013forming clusters\nwith UCHIIs.\n\n3.\n\nCore Destruction by External OB Stars (1-10 pc)\n\nOptical images of HII regions commonly show bright rimmed and cometary globules: dense molecular gas that survives in the HII region once the surrounding,\nlower density gas is swept away. These globules are directly exposed to the UV\nradiation from OB stars within the HII region. In a process called photoevaporation, the UV radiation produces a flow of ionized gas off the surfaces of the\nclump; the optical line emission producing the bright rims arises in this ionized\nflow. Despite the continual erosion of the molecular gas, a theoretical analysis\nby Bertoldi & McKee (1990) has demonstrated that these globules can survive\nfor millions of years in the HII region, depending on their mass and distance\nfrom the OB stars. This relatively long timescale for the core destruction allows\nfor the formation of groups and clusters in the exposed cores. Several examples\n\n\fImpact of Massive Stars\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.\nLeft: J-band image of the NGC 281 HII/H2 interface with\ncontours of the C18 O (2 \u2192 1) emission overlaid. Right: K-band image\nwith C18 O contours. The images are centered on the northern subcluster, which is associated with the two northernmost molecular cores.\nThe stars apparent in the bottom right corner of the images are in the\nsouthern sub-cluster associated with the southernmost molecular core\n(see Fig. 2).\n\nof young stellar groups forming in bright rimmed globules have been reported\nby Sugitani, Tamura & Ogura (1995).\nThe formation of groups and clusters in externally ionized cores may not\nresult solely from the long destruction timescales, but also from the triggering\nof star formation by the ionization. A likely example of triggered cluster formation is the NGC 281 infrared cluster, the richest cluster yet observed towards a\nbright rimmed globule. It is the most active region of ongoing star formation\nin NGC 281, containing at least one massive star, as evidenced by a 104 L\u2299\nIRAS source (Henning 1994), and a cluster of 240 lower\u2013mass stars, as detected\nin near\u2013IR images (Megeath & Wilson 1997). The infrared cluster, located in\nthe southwestern quadrant of the NGC 281 nebula, is not associated with the\noptical bright rimmed globules apparent in the nebula (Fig. 1).\nThe evidence for triggered star formation comes from combined centimeter, millimeter, and near\u2013IR data. Since optical observations of this region are\ncomplicated by a spatially varying extinction, we obtained C18 O maps, tracing\nthe dense cores, and a VLA 20 cm map, tracing the ionized gas, to disentangle\nthe structure of the H2 /HII interface with angular resolutions < 20\u2032\u2032 . The maps\nshow that the molecular gas is concentrated into three main cores and several\nsmaller clumps (Fig. 2). To the northern edges of each core, 20 cm emission tracing the ionized gas is detected, with particularly strong 20 cm emission adjacent\nto the two northernmost cores. These cores are radio bright rimmed globules.\nIn support of the radio data, recent Hubble space telescopes images taken with\nthe WFPC2 camera show the optical emission from H\u03b1 and [SII] lines extending\n\n\f6\n\nMegeath et al.\n\nFigure 4.\nThe velocity\u2013integrated CO (1 \u2192 0) line emission and HI\n21 cm line emission from the CfA CO survey and the Leiden\u2013Dwingeloo\nHI survey (Dame, Hartmann & Thaddeus 2001; Hartmann & Burton\n1997). Top: the local and Perseus arm velocity gas. Middle: The\nPerseus arm velocity gas. Bottom: 21 cm map of the HI emission integrated over the Perseus arm velocities. The NGC 281 cloud complex\nis delimited by the rectangle.\n\nto the cores. These data demonstrate that the cores are exposed to the UV radiation from the ionizing O star, and are photoevaporating. Megeath & Wilson\n(1997) estimate that at the current rate of photoevaporation, the observed cores\nwill be fully evaporated in 2.5 Myr.\nA comparison of the pressure from the ionized, photoevaporating gas at the\nclump surfaces to the turbulent pressure of the molecular gas in the clumps,\nindicates that the pressure of the ionized gas is sufficient to drive shock waves\ninto the molecular cores. The shocks would have a velocity of 1.5 km s\u22121 and a\ncrossing time of 0.7 Myr. The C18 O data show a ridge of blueshifted gas along\nthe northern edge of the cores: this may be the detection of gas swept up by the\nshock (see Megeath & Wilson 1997).\nNear\u2013IR images of the two northermost cores show a steep gradient in the\nsurface density of stars with most of the embedded stars concentrated near the\nphotoevaporating surfaces of the cores (Fig. 3). The lack of a corresponding gradient in the extinction through the cores, as demonstrated by the C18 O maps,\nimplies that the observed gradient in stellar density is due to an asymmetric\n\n\fImpact of Massive Stars\n\n7\n\ndistribution of stars. Megeath & Wilson (1997) have proposed that the asymmetry is the result of triggered star formation. In this picture, the shock fronts\nhave traversed roughly halfway through the cores. As the shocks compress the\ngas, they precipitate the formation of stars which then fill the post-shock gas.\nNear\u2013IR imaging of groups in optical bright rimmed globules have detected similar asymmetries in the distribution of stars (Sugitani, Tamura & Ogura 1995).\nThese data suggest that shock\u2013triggered formation may be a common process\nin cores exposed to the UV radiation from neighboring OB stars.\n4.\n\nSupernovae Driven Formation of Clusters (> 100 pc)\n\nThe NGC 281 nebula is part of a complex of molecular clouds in the Perseus arm\nof the galaxy (Fig. 4). The measured distance to the nebula (2.9 kpc; Guetter &\nTurner 1997) implies that the complex is located 300 pc below the galactic plane;\nin contrast, the rest of the Perseus arm clouds are found within 150 pc of the\nplane. Another unusual property of the NGC 281 complex is the high dispersion\nin cloud velocities: the longitude-velocity diagram in Fig. 5 shows a dispersion\nof 45 km s\u22121 . The high velocity dispersion suggests that the complex may only\nbe a chance alignment of clouds in the sky. However, the lack of other Perseus\narm clouds at these galactic latitudes, the linking of the CO clouds by the HI\nemission (Fig. 4 and 5), and the elliptical distribution of CO and HI emission in\nthe longitude-velocity diagram, all support the notion that these clouds form a\nbona fide complex of molecular and atomic clouds.\nThe elliptical pattern evident in the longitude-velocity diagram is indicative\nof an expanding ring. The diameter of the ring is 270 pc, the expansion velocity\nin the line of sight is 22 km s\u22121 , and the resulting dynamical time is 6 Myr. The\nmass in molecular gas, using a standard conversion from the velocity\u2013integrated\nCO temperatures to H2 column density, is 105 M\u2299 . The HI mass integrated over\nlatitudes of -6o to -11o and velocities of -15 km s\u22121 to -60 km s\u22121 is 3.5\u00d7105 M\u2299 .\nThe resulting kinetic energy is 4.5 \u00d7 1051 ergs, comparable to the energy of a\nsupernova.\nWe are currently exploring the possibility that the ring has formed in gas\nlifted out of the plane by the expansion of a superbubble. The HI emission in\nthe NGC 281 complex forms part of a loop of HI extending out of the plane; this\nloop may trace the shell of a superbubble driven by supernovae and winds from\nOB associations near the plane of the Galaxy (Fig. 4). Models of superbubbles expanding into a stratified galactic \"atmosphere\" predict that at a distance\nof a few hundred parsecs above the plane, the upward expansion of the bubble accelerates resulting in a blowout (MacLow & McCray 1988). Numerical\nsimulations of blowouts predict that the fragmenting shell can have velocities\nas large as 50 km s\u22121 tangential to the galactic plane (MacLow, McCray &\nNorman 1989). It is then plausible that the observed expanding ring has been\nformed in a blowout, with the clouds located at the distance from the plane\nwhere the blowout started. This interpretation suggests that the formation of\nthe entire NGC 281 complex has been triggered by previous generations of OB\nstars. This mode would operate on a totally different timescale (6 Myr vs 1\nMyr) and sizescale (300 pc vs 4 pc) than the triggered star formation discussed\nin the previous section.\n\n\f8\n\nMegeath et al.\n\nFigure 5.\nLongitude-velocity diagram of the CO (1 \u2192 0) (contours)\nand HI 21 cm emission (greyscale) integrated over b = \u22128o to \u22125o .\nThe contours levels are 0.1, 0.2 to 1.4 by 0.2 K deg.\nReferences\nBertoldi, F. & McKee, C.
