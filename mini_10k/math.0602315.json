Quadratic algebras associated to graphs have been introduced by\nI. Gelfand, S. Gelfand, and Retakh in connection with decompositions of noncommutative polynomials. Here we show that, for each graph with rare triangular subgraphs, the corresponding quadratic algebra is a Koszul domain with\nglobal dimension equal to the number of vertices of the graph.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe origin of the algebras considered here are the works of I. Gelfand, S. Gelfand,\nRetakh, Wilson, and others on decompositions of noncommutative polynomials and\nnoncommutative symmetric functions, see [GGRW] and references therein. Here we\nsketch some their definitions and results.\nLet C be a division algebra over a field k, and let P (x) \u2208 C[x] be a polynomial\nof degree n, where x ia a central variable. An element t \u2208 C is called pseudo-root\nof the polynomial P (x) if there is a decomposition\nP (x) = L(x)(x \u2212 t)R(x),\nwhere L(x), R(x) \u2208 C[x] are polynomials. For a generic monic polynomial P (x),\nthere are at least n2n\u22121 different pseudo-roots, but these pseudo-roots are connected\nby some linear and quadratic relations. So, it is natural to consider an universal\nquadratic algebra of pseudo-roots Qn , which is generated by these generic pseudoroots satisfiing these relations.\nThe algebra Qn has been studied in several papers [GRW, GGRSW, SW, Pi1].\nIt is a homogeneous quadratic Koszul algebra with 2n \u2212 1 generators and is very\nfar from being commutative. These generators uS may be naturally indexed by the\nnonempty subsets of the n-element set S \u2282 {1, . . . , n}. If we consider these subsets\nS as faces of the n \u2212 1-dimensional simplex \u2206, it is natural consider the ideals of\nI\u0393 in Qn generated by all simplicial subcomplexes \u0393 (that is, by the variables uS\nwith S \u2208 \u0393) of the simplex \u2206. The quotient algebras Q(\u0393) = Qn /I\u0393 would lead\nto \"noncommutative combinatorial topology\" [GGRW]. We need to \"glue\" such\nalgebras corresponding to different simplicial complexes in order to approximate\nthe noncommutative structure of the algebra Qn . To do this, we need to know, at\nfirst, the Hilbert series of the algebras Q(\u0393). Next, the algebra Qn is Koszul and\nhas global dimension n [SW, Pi1]. Therefore, to approximate it by some algebras\nQ(\u0393), it is important to answer a question stated by Vladimir Retakh: For which\nsimplicial complexes \u0393 the algebra Q(\u0393) is Koszul? We hope that all such algebras\nare Koszul of global dimension n.\nDate: July 23, 2018.\nKey words and phrases. graph, Koszul algebra, noncommutative polynomial, simplicial\ncomplex.\nPartially supported by the grant 02-01-00468 of the Russian Basic Research Foundation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDMITRI PIONTKOVSKI\n\nThe generators and relations of the algebras Q(\u0393) has been described in [GGR],\nwhere these algebras have been introduced. In the trivial case on 0-dimensional simplicial complex \u0393 (a set of n points), the algebra Q(\u0393) is an algebra of commutative\npolynomials in n variables. Special attention was given to the first non-trivial case\nof one-dimensional simplicial complex \u0393 (i. e., the case of a graph): correspondent\nalgebras seems to be the \"most commutative\" among all algebras Q(\u0393). In particular, in the case of one-dimensional \u0393 a simple set of relations has been described\nin [GGR].\nThe second step has been made by Nacin [N1, N2, N3]. He proved that the\nalgebra Q(\u0393) is Koszul for graphs of the following types: \"line\" (i. e., a graph\nwith n vertices 1, . . . , n and the edges (12), (23), . . . , (n \u2212 1, n)), \"star\" (vertices\nare (12), (13), . . . , (1n)), \"triangle\" (a complete graph with vertices). It is shown\nthat, in these 3 cases, the global dimension of the algebra Q(\u0393) is equal to the\nnumber of vertices, and Hilbert series of the algebra and its quadratic dual algebra\nare calculated. In particular, the following interesting fact is found in the cases\nof lines and stars: If Q(\u0393)! (z) = p0 + p1 z + * * * + pn z n is the Hilbert series of\nthe quadratic dual algebra Q(\u0393)! (i. e., pi = dim Q(\u0393)!i ), then the \"paliandromic\"\nequalities pi = pn\u2212i hold for all i \u2264 n. However, in the case of triangle this\npaliandromic property fails.\nIn this paper, we try to make a next step in this direction. We consider a\nmore general class of graphs, that is, the class of graphs with no overlapping\ntriangles, i. e., our graphs do not contain subgraphs isomorphic to the \"simple butterfly\" {(12), (13), (23), (14), (15), (45)} and the \"square with a diagonal\"\n{(12), (23), (34), (14), (13)}. In particular, this class includes all trees and all cyclic\ngraphs.\nOur main result is the following.\nTheorem 1.1 (Theorem 4.1). Suppose that a graph \u0393 with n vertices does not\ncontain a pair of overlapping triangles. Then the algebra Q(\u0393) is a Koszul domain\nof global dimension n.\nAlso, we give explicit formulae for Hilbert series of algebras Q(\u0393) and their dual\nalgebras Q(\u0393)! , see Corollary 4.3 and Proposition 4.4 below. In particular, we\nexplain the phenomenon of \"paliandroms\" found in [N2, N3] for some graphs.\nCorollary 1.2 (Corollary 4.5). Let pt = dim Q(\u0393)!t denotes the Hilbert function of\nthe quadratic algebra Q(\u0393)! dual to Q(\u0393). If \u0393 does not contain two overlapping\ntriangles, then pt = 0 for t > n and pt \u2265 pn\u2212t for all t \u2264 n/2. The equalities\npt = pn\u2212t hold for all t \u2264 n/2 if and only if the graph \u0393 is triangle free.\nLet us say a few words about other probable properties of algebras Q(\u0393). If the\ngraph \u0393 has at least one edge, then the algebra Q(\u0393) has exponential growth (since\nits quotient algebra Q2 has exponential growth), hence Q(\u0393) is not Noetherian [SZ].\nHowever, we conjecture that the algebras Qn and Q(\u0393) are (graded) coherent, that\nis, the kernel of every (homogeneous) map M \u2192 N of free finitely generated Q(\u0393)\u2013\nmodules is finitely generated. At least, the algebra Q2 is coherent by [Pi2]. If it\nis the case, the Koszul duality gives equivalences of several categories of finitely\npresented Q(\u0393)\u2013modules and their derived categories with the respective categories\nof modules over the finitely-dimensional algebra Q(\u0393)!

Let \u0393 = (W, E) be a graph\nwith n vertices 1, . . . , n, that is, 1\u2013dimensional simplicial complex. A construction\nin [GGR] assigns to \u0393 a quadratic associative algebra Q(\u0393) with generators {ui |i =\n1 . . . n} \u222a {uij |1 \u2264 ji \u2264 n, (ij) \u2208 E} (where a sub-index \"ij\" denotes an unordered\npair) and relations for all pairwise different indexes i, j, k, l\nR(ij) := [ui , uj ] \u2212 uij (ui \u2212 uj ), where i 6= j,\nR(ijk) := [ui , ujk ] + [uik , uj ] + [uik , ujk ] \u2212 uij (uik \u2212 ujk ),\nR(ijkl) := [uij , ukl ]\n(where upq = 0 for (pq) \u2208\n/ E).\n2.2. Koszulity. Recall that a graded connected degree-one generated algebra A\nover a field k (i. e. A = k \u2295 A1 \u2295 A2 \u2295 . . . is generated by the graded component A1 )\nis called Koszul if the trivial right A-module kA has a linear free resolution, that is,\nTor A\ni (k, k)j = 0 for all i, j but i = j (graded the homologies of A are concentrated\nin the diagonal). We will use the following criterion for Koszul algebras [PP].\nLet A be a quadratic algebra. Assume that A is filtered by a N\u2013graded ordered\nsemigroup S such that the filtration on the graded component An is induced by\nthe filtration on the space of generators V = A1 . Then A has also an N\u2013filtration\ninduced by the grading of S. The associated graded algebra gr A may in general\nbe non-quadratic; let R \u2282 A1 \u2297 A1 be a set of quadratic relations of the algebra\ngr A (that is, the degree two graded component of the ideal of relations) and let\nB = T (A1 )/id (R) be its quadratic part.\nTheorem 2.1 ([PP], Theorem 7.1 in Ch. 4). Assume that, in the notation above,\n(i) the algebra gr A has no nontrivial relations in degree 3\nand\n(ii) the algebra B is Koszul.\nThen gr A = B and A is Koszul.\nThe condition (i) here is equivalent to the equality dim A3 = dim B3 , because\ndim A3 = dim gr A3 .\nA classical particular case of this theorem is that every algebra with quadratic\nGroebner basis is Koszul [Pr] (since every monomial quadratic algebra B is Koszul).\nAnother standard consequence is that every quotient of a polynomial ring or an\nexternal algebra by an ideal with quadratic Groebner basis is Koszul (because the\nKoszulness of a quotient of an external algebra by a set of quadratic monomials\nfollows from the results of [F]). We will use this corollary in the case of external\nalgebras.\nFor the background on Groebner basis in the free associative algebra, we refer\nthe reader to [U].\n\n\f4\n\nDMITRI PIONTKOVSKI\n\n3. Associated quadratic algebra to Q(\u0393)\nLet us introduce a filtration on the algebra A = Q(\u0393) by setting new degrees\nof generators as |ui | = 1 and |uij | = 0. Then the associated quadratic algebra\nB = B(\u0393) has the same generators as A and the relations\nS(ij) := [ui , uj ],\nS(ijk) := [ui , ujk ] + [uik , uj ],\nS(ijkl) := R(ijkl) = [uij , ukl ]\n(where again upq = 0 for (pq) \u2208\n/ E, and the indexes i, j, k, l are pairwise different).\nBecause these relations are linear combinations of commutators of generators, the\nalgebra B is a universal enveloping algebra of the quadratic Lie algebra g = g(\u0393)\ngiven presented by the same generators and relations.\nTo use Theorem 2.1, we need\nProposition 3.1. For every graph \u0393, we have dim Q(\u0393)3 = dim B(\u0393)3 .\nProof. Let u be the minimal set of degree-one homogeneous generators of A (and\nB) listed above. Let G = {0, 1} be the two\u2013elements multiplicative semigroup. Let\nus introduce a Gn -grading on the free algebra T (u) by assigning deg \u2032 ui = 1i :=\n(0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) (the unit in the i-th place) and deg \u2032 uij := 1i + 1j . Then the\nrelations of both algebras A and B becomes homogeneous w. r. t. this new grading,\nso, the new Gn -rading is correct, and the algebras become Z \u00d7 Gn -graded.\nIn order to check the equality dim Q(\u0393)3 = dim B(\u0393)3 , we have to check the\nequalities for dimensions of graded components dim Q(\u0393)3,g = dim B(\u0393)3,g for every\ng \u2208 Gn . For g = (g1 , . . . , gn ) \u2208 Gn , let |g| denotes the number of units among gi .\nBecause for every generator u\u2217 we have |deg \u2032 u\u2217 | \u2264 2, hence Q(\u0393)1,g = B(\u0393)1,g = 0\nif |g| > 2, therefore, Q(\u0393)3,g = B(\u0393)3,g = 0 for |g| > 6. So, it remains to check the\nequalities dim Q(\u0393)3,g = dim B(\u0393)3,g for all g with |g| \u2264 6. This means that there\nare some subindexes i1 , . . . , is , where s \u2264 6, such that all elements in Q(\u0393)3,g and\nB(\u0393)3,g lies in the span of monomials on some generators u\u2217 depending on these\nsubindexes only. Hence we may ignore all the relations of algebras A and B which\ndepend on other subindexes, that is, we work in the subgraph of \u0393 with vertices\ni1 , . . . , i6 . This means that it is sufficient to prove proposition 3.1 for n \u2264 6.\nMoreover, if |g| = 6, then all the monomials in the decomposition of every element f \u2208 Q(\u0393)3,g (or f \u2208 B(\u0393)3,g ) must have the form \u03bc = uij ukl umn , where all\nindexes i, . . . , n are pairwise different. Let \u039e be the span of monomials of that type\nin the free algebra T (A1 ) generated by u. The intersections of \u039e with the ideal of\nrelations of the algebras Q(\u0393) and B(\u0393) are the same as its intersection with the\nideal I\u039e generated by the relations of the type R(ijkl), because R(ijkl) \u2208 \u039e, while\nfor every other relation R\u2217 or S\u2217 listed above, any monomial in the decomposition\nof this noncommutative polynomial is not a submonomial of a monomial of the\nform \u03bc. Therefore, the vector spaces Q(\u0393)3,g are B(\u0393)3,g are isomorphic to the correspondent graded component of the algebra T (A1 )/I\u039e , hence they are isomorphic\nto each other.\nNow, it remains to consider the case |g| \u2264 5. By the same arguments as above,\nit sufficient to show the following\nLemma 3.2. If n \u2264 5, then the statement of Proposition 3.1 is true.\n\n\fKOSZUL ALGEBRAS ASSOCIATED TO GRAPHS\n\n5\n\nProof of Lemma 3.2. Being a statement about dimensions of some subspaces in\nfinite\u2013dimensional vector spaces, this Lemma is proved by a direct computer calculation. There are 33 pairwise non-isomorphical graphs with \u2264 5 vertices. For\nall these cases, suitable dimensions of the third components of algebras Q(\u0393) and\nB(\u0393) have been calculated via computations of Hilbert series up to the 3-rd power.\nFor this purpose, I used a software GRAAL (developed by Alexei Kondratiev). In\neach of these 33 cases, the calculation shows that the Hilbert series of the algebras Q(\u0393) and B(\u0393) are equal to each other at least up to o(z 4 ); in particular,\ndim Q(\u0393)3 = dim B(\u0393)3 .\n\u0003\nSo, Proposition 3.1 is proved completely.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the view of Theorem 2.1, we have\nCorollary 3.3. If, for some \u0393, the algebra B(\u0393) is Koszul, then the algebra Q(\u0393)\nis Koszul too, and both algebras are domains.\nProof. The Koszulity is a part of Theorem 2.1. It remains to show that the algebras Q = Q(\u0393) and B = B(\u0393) have no zerodivisors. Indeed, B is an universal\nenaveloping algebra of some graded Lie superalgebra (because the relations of the\nalgebra B are linear combinations of commutators of some variables), hence it is a\ndomain. By Theorem 2.1, B = gr A, so, A is a domain too.\n\u0003\n4. Graphs without overlapping triangles\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose that there do not exist two triangles with common vertex\nin \u0393. Then both algebras A = Q(\u0393) and B = B(\u0393) are Koszul domains and have\nglobal dimension n.\nProof. The dual quadratic algebra B ! is a quotient of an external algebra \u039bV (where\nV is a span of indeterminates {ei |i = 1 . . . n} \u222a {eij |1 \u2264 ji \u2264 n, (ij) \u2208 E}) by an\nideal generated by the following relations:\n(4.1)\n\nT (ijk) := ei ejk + ej eki + ek eij , where (ij), (jk), (ij) \u2208 E,\nU (ik) := ei eik ,\nW (ijk) := eik ejk .\n\nWe claim that these relations (with i < j) form a Groebner basis of the ideal\nI in \u039bV generated by them w. r. t. any degree\u2013lexicographical order with en >\n. . . e1 > eij .\nWe use standard Buchberger criterion.\nA nontrivial s\u2013polynomials may occur only involving some non\u2013monomial relation T (ijk), where (jk), (ik), (ij) \u2208 E with i > j, i > k. Its leading term is\nT^\n(ijk) = ei ejk . The following s\u2013polynomials are obviously reduced to zero by\nU (ik) and W (ijk) (in these presentations, we omit the monomials ovbiously reduced to zero): ei T (ijk) = ei ej eik + ei ek eij , T (ijk)ejk = ej eik ejk + ek eij ejk ,\nT (ijk)eim + U (im)ejk = ej eik ejm + ek eij ejm , T (ijk)ek + ei U (kj) = eik ej ek , and\nT (ijk)esk + ei W (sjk) = ej eik esk + ek eij esk .\nIt remains to consider the intersections between leading monomials of T (ijk)\nand some other T (pqr). If T (pqr) exists, then the triangle (pqr) = {(pq), (qr), (pr)}\nexists in E. If there is an overlap between the leading terms of T (ijk) and T (pqr),\nthe triangles (ijk) and (pqr) must have at least one common vertex. But it is\nimpossible, so that there is no other s-polynomials.\n\n\f6\n\nDMITRI PIONTKOVSKI\n\nSo, the algebra B ! has quadratic Groebner basis as a quotient of \u039bV . Hence it\nis Koszul, so that B is Koszul too. By Corollary 3.3, both algebras A and B are\nKoszul domains. Because gl. dim A = max{d|A!d 6= 0} and A! (z) = A(\u2212z)\u22121 =\nB(\u2212z)\u22121 = B ! (z), we have gl. dim A = gl. dim B = max{d|Bd! 6= 0}. To calculate\nthis global dimension, we give a description of linear basis of the algebra B ! .\nBy the definition of the Groebner basis, there is a linear basis of B ! consisting of\nall monomials in \u039bV which are not divisible by the leading terms of the Groebner\nbasis. These leading terms are the following:\n(4.2)\n\nej ejk ;\nei ejk , where i > j > k and (ij), (ik), (ij) \u2208 E;\neij ejk , where i > k.\n\nIn particular, the only element of degree n in the basis of B ! is e1 . . . en , and there\nare no elements of higher degree.\n\u0003\nNotice that we have obtain a linear basis of the algebra B(\u0393)! . Since the algebra\nQ(\u0393)! is an associated graded algebra to a filtration on it [PP, Ch. 4, Corollary 7.3].\nSo, we get\nCorollary 4.2. The monomials of the form\nei1 i2 , . . . , ei2p\u22121 i2p ej1 . . . ejq ,\nwhere where i1 > i3 > * * * > i2p\u22121 , j1 > * * * > jq , i1 > i2 , . . . , i2p\u22121 > i2p , all\nindexes i1 , . . . , i2p , j1 , . . . , jq are pairwise different, and for every s \u2264 p, t \u2264 q either\njt < i2s\u22121 or (jt , i2s\u22121 ) \u2208\n/ E or (jt , i2s ) \u2208\n/ E, form a linear basis of the algebra\nQ(\u0393)! .\nCorollary 4.3. Suppose that there do not exist two triangles with common vertex\nin \u0393. Then the Hilbert series of the algebra Q(\u0393) is\nQ(\u0393)(z) = p\u0393 (\u2212z)\u22121 ,\nwhere p\u0393 (z) = Q(\u0393)! (z) = B(\u0393)! (z) is a polynomial of degree n with positive integer\ncoefficients.\nTo give an implicit formula for this polynomial p\u0393 (z) = p0 + p1 z + * * * + pn z n ,\nlet us introduce some notations. Let Lp be the set of all p-elements subsets W =\n{ei1 i2 , . . . , ei2p\u22121 i2p } (where i2j\u22121 > i2j for all j) such that is 6= it for all s, t =\n1 . . . 2p. Given such a subset W , let RW denote the set of indexes m \u2208 [1..n]\nsuch that m 6= is and for every j = 1 . . . p either m < i2j\u22121 or (m, i2j\u22121 ) \u2208\n/ E\nor (m, i2j ) \u2208\n/ E (by the other words, we avoid all triangles {m, i2j\u22121 , i2j } with\nm > i2j\u22121 > i2j ). Let lp and rW denote the cardinalities of the sets Lp and RW .\nProposition 4.4. Suppose that there do not exist two triangles with common vertex\nin \u0393. Then the Hilbert series p(z) = Q(\u0393)! (z) = B(\u0393)! (z) is calculated by the\nformula\n[n/2]\nX\nX\np(z) =\nzp\n(1 + z)rW .\np=0\n\nW \u2208Lp\n\nIn particular, if there is no triangle in \u0393, then\n[n/2]\n\np(z) =\n\nX\np=0\n\nlp z p (1 + z)n\u22122p .\n\n\fKOSZUL ALGEBRAS ASSOCIATED TO GRAPHS\n\n7\n\nProof. The coefficient pt is equal to the number of elements in the t-th graded\ncomponent of the linear basis of the algebra B ! described above. It follows\nfrom the description (4.2) that this graded component consists of the square\nfree commutative monomials of the form ei1 i2 , . . . , ei2p\u22121 i2p ej1 . . . ejt\u2212p , where\n/ RW for all s = 1 . . . t \u2212 p. Given such\nW := {ei1 i2 , . . . , ei2p\u22121 i2p } \u2208 Lp and j\u0001s \u2208\nrW\nW and t > p, we obtain exactly t\u2212p\nmonomials of this type. Now, the desired\nequalities immediately follow from the binomial decompositions.\n\u0003\nIn particular, we have\nCorollary 4.5. If \u0393 does not contain two overlapping triangles, we have pt \u2265 pn\u2212t\nfor all t < n/2. The equalities pt = pn\u2212t hold for all t < n/2 if and only if there is\nno triangle in \u0393.\nProof. The first inequality holds (for every t) for the coefficients of z t and z n\u2212t in\nevery summand of the first sum in Proposition 4.4 (because rW \u2264 n \u2212 2p), hence\nit holds also for the whole sum. The equality means that rW = n \u2212 2p for every\nW \u2208 Lp , that is, there is no triangle in \u0393.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.6. In the view of 'paliandromic' equalities pt = pn\u2212t for the dimensions\nof graded components of algebras Q(\u0393)! and B ! for triangle free ghaphs, one could\nconjecture that these algebras are Frobenius; in this case, the algebras Q(\u0393) and\nB(\u0393) are Gorenstein of finite global dimension, that is, generalized Artin\u2013Shelter\nregular. However, for any such graph \u0393 with at least one edge (ij) the both these\nalgebras are not Frobenius.\nIndeed, by definition, an algebra A = A0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 An is Frobenius if dim An =\ndim A0 = 1 and the multiplication induces a non-degenerate pairing\nAt \u2297 An\u2212t \u2192\nL\n!\n!\n. . . ein\u22121 eij +\nA\nfor\nall\nt.\nHowever,\nin\nthe\nalgebra\nB\nwe\nhave\nB\ne\n=\nke\nn\nij\ni\n1\nn\u22121\nL\nkei0 i1 ei2 . . . ein\u22121 eij = 0, since in every summand at least one index appears\n!\n\u2297 B1! \u2192 Bn! is degenerate. Moreover, all quadratic\ntwice, hence the pairing Bn\u22121\nmonomials on variables ei , eij which do not appear in the relations of the algebra\nQ(\u0393) listed in the subsection 2.1 are monomial relations of the algebra Q(\u0393)! (with\nletters 'u' replaced by 'e'). In particular, we have the equalities ei eij = ej eij = 0 and\ne2ij = 0 in the algebra Q(\u0393)! . Because B ! = gr Q(\u0393)! , every monomial basis of the\n!\nis also a monomial basis in the vector space Q(\u0393)!n\u22121 . Therefore,\nvector space Bn\u22121\ngiven two indexes i, j, there is a basis of the vector space Q(\u0393)!n\u22121 consisting of\nthe monomials of the form ei1 . . . ein\u22121 , ei0 i1 ei2 . . . ein\u22121 , and ei1 . . . ein\u22122 eij , where\neither in\u22121 = i or in\u22121 = j. Thus, Q(\u0393)!n\u22121 eij = 0 for every edge (ij) \u2208 E, so, the\nalgebra Q(\u0393)! is not Frobenius.\nReferences\n[BGS]\n\nA. Beilinson, V. Ginzburg, W.
