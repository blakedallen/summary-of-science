Entangled photons\nare sent via an optical fiber network to two villages near Geneva, separated by more than 10 km where they are analyzed by interferometers.\nThe photon pair source is set as precisely as possible in the center so\nthat the two photons arrive at the detectors within a time interval of\nless than 5 ps (corresponding to a path length difference of less than\n1 mm ). One detector is set in motion so that both detectors, each in\nits own inertial reference frame, are first to do the measurement! The\ndata always reproduces the quantum correlations, making it thus more\ndifficult to consider the projection postulate as a compact description\nof real collapses of the wave-function.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the famous article by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 [1]\n\"quantum non-locality\", received quite a lot of attention. They described a\nsituation where two entangled quantum systems are measured at a distance.\nThe correlation between the data can't be explained by local variables, as\ndemonstrated by Bell in 1964 [2], although they can't be used to communicate information faster than light. Indeed, the data on both sides, although\nhighly correlated, is random. There is thus no obvious conflict with special relativity. In a realist's view the correlation could be \"explained\" by\nan action of the first measurement on the second one. This explanation is\nintuitive, but, if the distance between the two detection events is space-like,\nincompatible with relativity.\n1\n\n\fThis tension between quantum mechanics and relativity has long been\nstudied by theorists, see among many others [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. But it clearly\ndeserves to be analyzed experimentally and the first realization of a new\nkind of test is the main result of this article. Let us recall that the tension is\nbetween the collapse of the quantum state (also called \"objectification\" [8],\nor \"actualization of potential properties\" [9, 10, 11]) and Lorentz invariance:\nsince the collapse instantaneously affects the state of systems composed of\ndistance parts, it can't be described in a covariant way. From this observation one may conclude either that there is no collapse or that this tension\nindicates a place to look for new physics. The assumption that there is no\nreal collapse sounds strange to us, though, admittedly, it deserves to be developed [12]. Anyway, in this article we follow the intuition that the tension\nbetween quantum mechanics and relativity is a guide for new physics. In\norder to test this tension, we design an experiment in which both quantum\nnonlocality and relativity play a crucial role. By quantum nonlocality we\nmean here measurements on two systems that are spatially separated, but\nstill described as one global quantum object characterized by one state vector\n(i.e. the two systems are entangled). For relativity we like a role more prominent than mere spatial separation, as in tests of Bell inequalities. Central to\nrelativity (at least to special relativity) is the relativity of time, which may\ndiffer between inertial frames with relative velocities. Hence, we like to have\nthe observers of the two quantum systems not only space-like separated, but\nmoreover in relative motion such that the chronology of the measurement\nevents is relative to the observer: each observer in his own inertial frame\nperforms his measurement before the other observer. In such a situation\nthe concept of \"collapse\" is even weirder: both observers equivalently claim\nto trigger the collapse first! Actually one can then argue, following Suarez\nand Scarani [13], that in such a situation each measurement is independent\nfrom the other and that the outcomes are uncorrelated (more precisely, that\nonly classical correlation remain, the quantum correlation carried by the\nwave-function being broken, see appendix A).\nLet us elaborate on the intuition that motivates our experiment. Each\nreference frame determines a time ordering. Hence, in each reference frame\none measurement takes place before the other and can be considered as the\ntrigger (the cause) of the collapse. The picture is then the following: the first\nmeasurement produces a random outcome with probabilities determined by\nthe local quantum state (the entire state is not needed to compute the probabilities, the local state obtained by tracing over the distant system suffices).\nWhen the outcome is produced, the global quantum state is reduced. This\n2\n\n\fis the controversial part of the process since this reduction happens instantaneously in theory and faster than light according to experimental tests\nof Bell inequality. The second measurement can then be described like the\nfirst one: it produces a random outcome with probabilities determined by\nthe local state. The only difference with respect to the first measurement\nis that the local state of the second measurement contains \"information\"\nabout the outcome of the first measurement. Since this \"information\" can\nnot be used to transmit a classical message, there is no direct conflict with\nrelativity and we term this \"information\" as quantum information. Since\nin our experiment the time intervall between the two meaurements is minimized, it will supply a lower limit of the speed of this quantum information.\nSo far the described picture of the collapse is compatible with relativity,\nand with all experiments performed so far. But let us now assume that the\ntwo observers are in relative motion such that they disagree on the time\nordering of the measurements. Then, it is plausible that each measurement\nproduces random outcomes with probabilities determined by the local sates\n(see appendix A):\nP rob(+ + |bef ore \u2212 bef ore) = < P\u03b1 \u2297 11 >\u03c8 < 11 \u2297 P\u03b2 >\u03c8\n= T r(P\u03b1 \u03c11 )T r(P\u03b2 \u03c12 )\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c11 = T r2 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2020 ) and \u03c12 = T r1 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2020 ) are the local states obtained by\ntracing over the other sub-system and P\u03b1 and P\u03b2 the projectors corresponding to the two measurements. For singlet states, for example, the probability\nof (++) outcomes would be 14 , independently of the orientations of the analyzers. The above prediction, based on plausible intuition inspired by the\nwork of Suarez and Scarani [13], differs from the quantum predictions. However, it does not contradict any experimental result and deserves thus to be\ntested experimentally.\nAt first sight the experiment may seem exceedingly difficult. First, because it requires relativistic speeds in order to have different time ordering.\nNext, because it requires the precise characterization of the vague concepts\nof \"observer\" and \"measurement\". In the next section, we argue that the\nfirst difficulty can be mastered and that the second one offers the possibility\nto elaborate on these delicate concepts in an experimentally defined context\n(much more promising than mere theoretical elecubrations). Then, sections\n3 and 4 describe the technical aspects of the experiment, while section 5\ncontains the measurement results.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nA Bell experiment with a moving observer\n\nConsider the following situation depicted in Fig. 1: A source S emits two\nphotons that travel to the analyzers at Alice and Bob respectively. Bob is\nmoving away from Alice with the speed v. Let the event A, the detection of\nthe first photon by Alice, be at the origin of reference frames of Alice and\nBob (Aa = (x = 0, t = 0), Ab = (x' = 0, t' = 0) ). For the event B, the\ndetection of the second photon by Bob, we note Ba = (x = L, t = \u03b4t), where\nL is the distance between Alice and Bob at time t=0 and \u03b4t is the (small)\ntime difference between B and A in the reference frame of Alice. The time\ndifference between B and A in the reference frame of Bob, is\n\u03b4t \u2212 vL\nvL\nc2 \u223c\n\u03b4t\u2032 = q\n= \u03b4t \u2212 2\nc\nv2\n1 \u2212 c2\n\n(3)\n\nHence, if\nvL\n\u2265 \u03b4t \u2265 0\n(4)\nc2\nthen the time ordering of A and B is not the same in the reference frames of\nAlice and of Bob. As a consequence both observers have the impression to\nperform the measurement first, hence to provoke the collapse of the wavefunction first. And one can argue, as we have done in the introduction, that\nin such a situation the non-local correlation should disappear.\nReasonably achievable speeds v are in the order of 100m/s. This means\nthat if you intend to perform the experiment in the lab with separations L\nsay 20m, \u03b4t must be smaller than 20 fs, corresponding to a distance in air of\n6 \u03bcm. Such a short distance or time difference is only useful if the photon is\nlocalized as well as that. A coherence length of 6\u03bcm demands a bandwidth\nof 150 nm, which is hardly achievable for photon pairs. In conclusion, one\nshould go to larger distances L which requires optical fibers. For L=10km,\n\u03b4t must be shorter than 10 ps or 2mm of optical fibre. So you need two\noptical fibre links of at least 5 km (installed fiber are not straight lines!)\nthat are equal to about 1 mm in length. At the same time you have to make\nsure that the photons are not delocalized due to the chromatic dispersion.\nThe next section describes how we can achieve that.\nBefore, we have to discuss the question \"what is an observer?\", and\n\"where does a collapse of the wavefunction take place?\". Is it in the physicist's mind, in the photon counter, or already at the beamsplitter or polarizer? The answer to such questions is usually not of practical relevance;\n4\n\n\fhowever, for our kind of experiment the answer is crucial. It determines\nwhich part of the experiment should be moving and to which point the optical paths must have the same length. In this article, we assume that the\neffect occurs at the detector, when the irreversible transition from \"quantum\" to \"classical\" occurs. So we will have a situation like in Fig. 2a. Alice\nand Bob each have two detectors ( A+ , A\u2212 , B+ , B\u2212 ), two of which (A+, B+ )\nare at precisely the same distance from the source. There are four possible\noutcomes with the corresponding probabilities. Normalization (conservation\nof particle number) imposes:\nPA+ ,B+ + PA+ ,B\u2212 + PA\u2212 ,B+ + PA\u2212 ,B\u2212\n\n= 1\n\n(5)\n\nPA+ + PA\u2212\n\n= 1\n\n(6)\n\nPB+ + PB\u2212\n\n= 1\n\n(7)\n\nThe last two eqs. imply that if the photon is not detected by A+ , then it\nis necessarily detected by A\u2212 (assuming perfectly efficient detectors), and\nsimilarly for Bob's detectors. Moreover, for maximally entangled states, as\nin our experiment, all 4 detectors have a probability 12 of detecting a photon,\nindependently of the interferometers settings:\nPA+ = PA\u2212 = PB+ = PB\u2212 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(8)\n\nWith all detectors at rest, we can expect correlation of the events as a\nfunction of phase in the interferometers (or angles of the polarizers), as\ndemonstrated in our previous experiment [14, 15]:\n1 \u2212 cos(\u03b4a + \u03b4b )\n1 + cos(\u03b4a + \u03b4b )\nand PAQM\n= PAQM\n=\n+ ,B\u2212\n\u2212 ,B+\n2\n2\n(9)\nwhere the suffix QM stands for Quantum Mechanics. If now, the detector\nB+ is moving with respect to A+ one might argue that correlations disappear\n(see the introduction and appendix A), i.e. that\nPAQM\n= PAQM\n=\n+ ,B+\n\u2212 ,B\u2212\n\nPAbb+ ,B+ = const. =\n\n1\n4\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the suffix bb stands for before-before. Using (8) one has PA+ ,B\u2212 =\nconst. = 14 and, with help of (5) one deduces PA\u2212 ,B\u2212 = const. = 41 . Consequently, one can test the prediction (10) by only looking at the coincidences\nbetween A\u2212 and B\u2212 , the two detectors at rest! These detectors just have to\n5\n\n\fbe further away from the source than A+ and B+ to assure that the collapse\noccurs at A+ or B+ .\nThe next question reads What is a detector?. One definition could be:\nit is any physical system in which the photon is irreversibly absorbed and\ntransformed into a classical signal. The essential part is the irreversible\nprocess, the absorption of the photon in a solid and the transformation of\nits energy into heat. Since, as we have seen above, we don't need to read the\nsignal of the moving detector, the detector can be turned off or only consist\nof a non-fluorescent, black paint absorber (one can imagine that we could\nmeasure the temperature increase due to the absorption of the photon).\nAccordingly, detectors A+ and B+ can be just absorbing black surfaces The\nblack surfaces provoke the collapse, even in the case that the photons go to\nthe detectors! This considerably facilitates the experiment: First, we don't\nneed to identify precisely the absorbing layer of the photodiode. Second, the\nmoving detector will be a spinning wheel. The rim of the wheel is painted\nblack and the end of the optical fiber is pointed from outside on it (see Fig.\n2b). Note that during the 50 \u03bcs time of flight of the photon from the source,\nthe wheel's edge moves by about 5 mm, thus our \"detector\", the molecules of\nthe black paint, make in a good approximation a linear movement, defining\nthe inertial reference frame. We don't need electrical or optical contact,\nneither cooling of our spinning wheel as if a real detector was mounted.\nWe admit that the above argument is questionable and that it would\nbe nicer to have real, moving photon counters that make \"click\". However,\nthe argument is fair and it clearly turns a nightmare experiment into a feasible one. Let us also note that in their original work, Suarez and Scarani\nproposed, inspired by Bohm's model, that the relevant device is the beamsplitter and not the detector. Thus, our experiment is not a test of their\nmodel.\n\n3\n\nEqualizing two fiber optical links\n\nIn order to perform the experiment, the source has to be set precisely at\nthe center so that in the Geneva reference frames both photons are analyzed\nwithin a few ps, corresponding to about a millimeter over a fiber length\nof more then 18 km. In this section we describe how we achieved such a\nprecision. Clearly, the chromatic dispersion which spread the photon wavepacket is also a serious concern.\n\n6\n\n\fWe used installed telecom fibres and work with photons at wavelengths\naround 1300 nm. The relative group delay \u03c4 (\u03bb) of a pulse, expressed in\n[ps/km], can be well fitted by the Sellmeier equation:\n\u03c4 (\u03bb) = a\u03bb2 + b\u03bb\u22122 + c\n\n(11)\n\nd\u03c4\nThe dispersion coefficient D is defined as D = d\u03bb\nhas the units ps/nm *\nkm and goes to zero at the zero dispersion wavelength \u03bb0 . The parameter\nS0 is the slope of the dispersion at \u03bb0 . For standard telecom fibers \u03bb0 is\nsituated around 1310 nm and S0 is close to 0.08pps/km nm2 . Equation (11)\ncan be rewritten in terms of S0 = 8a and \u03bb0 = 4 b/a:\n\n\u03c4 (\u03bb) = \u03c40 +\n\nS0\n\u03bb2\nS0\n(\u03bb \u2212 0 )2 \u2248 \u03c40 + (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )2\n8\n\u03bb\n2\n\n(12)\n\nThe first term (the group velocity delay) can be adjusted with a precison\naround 100 \u03bcm (see below):\nA\nB B\n\u03c4 (\u03bbA\n0 )l \u2248 \u03c4 (\u03bb0 )l\n\n(13)\n\nB\nwhere lA , lB , \u03bbA\n0 and \u03bb0 denote the lengths and the zero dispersion wavelengths of the fibres going to Alice and Bob, respectively. However, a simple\nestimate of the second term (chromatic dispersion) shows that a photon\ncentered at \u03bb0 with a bandwidth of say 50 nm would suffer a spread of 245\nps per 10 km, which is much more than the maximum 10 ps target. Fortunately, working with photon pairs the major part of dispersion can be\ncancelled due to the energy correlation of the photons. Since \u03c9p = \u03c9s + \u03c9i\nthe delays undergone by the signal and idler photons can be equalized:\n2\nB B\nB 2\nS0A (\u03bbA \u2212 \u03bbA\n0 ) \u2248 S0 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\n\n(14)\n\nB\nA\nB\nFor this we chose fibers such that \u03bbA\n0 \u2248 \u03bb0 , S0 \u2248 S0 , and tuned the\n\u03bbA +\u03bbB\n\npumpwavelength to obtain 2\u03bbp = 0 2 0 (note, that eq. (12) is in function\nof \u03bb whereas the signal and idler photons are symmetric in \u03c9, but makes\nonly a second order difference ). The difference in the group delay is then:\n\n\u03b4t = lA (\u03c40A +\n\nS0B B\nS0A A\n2\nB B\n2\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbA\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbB\n0 ) ) \u2212 l (\u03c40 +\n0) )\u22480\n2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nAccordingly, in theory the quadratic term of (12) cancels and higher\norder terms are limiting. In practice, however, the precision with which one\n7\n\n\fcan measure and equalize the \u03bb0 's of the fibers determine \u03b4t. For a given\nspectral distribution of the photon pairs, determined by the transmission\ncurve of an interference filter a corresponding distribution of the \u03b4t in the\ngroup delay (see Fig. 3 ) is obtained. Table 1 gives two figures of merit for the\ntemporal spread in ps per km for different deviations of center wavelength of\n\u03bbA +\u03bbB\nthe photon pairs from the mean zero dispersion wavelength (2\u03bbp \u2212 0 2 0 )\nand bandwidths \u2206\u03bb (FWHM) of the filter. These are the \u2206\u03c4max , the\nmaximum difference of\n\u03b4t for 95% of the photons that are within the 2\u03bbp \u00b12\u03c3\nq\nR\n\n(\u03b4t(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b4t)2 p(\u03bb), the mean square deviation.

Unfortunately, this apparatus revealed variations of the zero-dispersion wavelength of up to 2 nm.\nNext, we built up our own apparatus using a Delay generator (Standford\n530), a pulsed LED, a tunable filter(JDS), an actively gated InGaAs APD\nand a time to amplitude converter (TAC, Tenelec TC836) [16]. We obtained\na reproducibility of 0.1 nm and estimated the absolute error as 0.2 nm [17].\nThe length measurement was done in a first step with a home-made OTDR\nsetup similar to that used for the dispersion measurement. It achieved a\nprecision of 1-2 mm. In a second step we used a low coherence reflectometer\n(an interferometer with a scanning mirror) to determine the path difference\nto a precision of about 0.1 mm (Figure 4 shows a typical scan) 1 . The\n\u03bbA\n0\n\n1\nSince the absorbers don't reflect the light, the measurement has to be performed in\ntwo steps: For both interferometers, we measured the path lengths from the input of\nthe circulator to the absorbing surfaces with a precision of about 50 \u03bcm. In addition we\ndetermined the length of two pigtails with mirrored fiber ends with the same precision.\nThis allowed us then to measure the path length difference between link A and B by\n\n8\n\n\fstandard resolution of about 20 \u03bcm could not be obtained, since we had to\nreduce the spectral width of the LED with a tunable filter of 2 nm width\n(FWHM) in order to see interference. If the dispersion properties of two\nfibers were perfectly identical, the wavelength of the LED wouldn't matter.\nWe limited a possible shift of group delay by centering the filter at 2\u03bbp . We\nestimated the error of 2\u03bbp as 0.2 nm and we conservatively assumed that\n\u03bbA +\u03bbB\n\nB\n2\u03bbp \u2212 0 2 0 \u2248 0.5 nm. For relative high differences \u03bbA\n0 \u2212\u03bb0 \u2264 1 nm we then\nobtained a maximal shift of 0.1 ps/km what is negligable. Concerning the\ntemporal spread of the photons we obtained according to Table 1 a spread\n\u2206\u03c4 of about 5 ps (for 10 km of fiber) if the bandwith of the downconverted\nphotons is limited to 10 nm.\nWe performed our experiments between three Swisscom stations in Geneva\nand Bernex and Bellevue separated by 10.6 km bee-line. We obtained\n9.53 km for link A (Geneva-Bernex) and 8.23 km for the link B (GenevaBellevue). We added 500 m dispersion shifted fiber to link A and 1.80 km\nof standard fiber to link B equalize roughly the length and as precisely as\nB\npossible \u03bb0 and ended up with \u03bbA\n0 = 1313.0 nm and \u03bb0 = 1313.3 nm. Two\nmeters of fiber were mounted on a rail in order to adjust the length of link\nA by pulling or releasing the fiber. In Bellevue, the distance between the\nend of the fiber and the black wheel could also be adjusted within a range\nof a few mm.\n\n4\n\nExperimental setup\n\nThe experimental setup was similar to our Franson-type Bell-experiment\npresented earlier in more detail [14], [15], see Fig. 5. The parametric downconversion source consisted essentially of a 655 nm diode laser (30mW Mitsubishi) with external grating and a KNbO3 crystal (length 10 mm, cut at\n\u03b8 = 33o ). The analyzers were two Michelson interferometers with Faraday\nmirrors. We used optical circulators at the input ports in order to access\nto both outputs of the interferometers. At the circulator output ports we\nhad our absorbers, a black scotch tape at A, the black wheel at B. These\ntwo surfaces were at exactly the same distance from the source. At the\nother output ports we connected our photon counters (passively quenched\nNEC Ge APD's), making sure that they were further away from the source\nthan the absorbers. Any detection triggered a laser pulse that was sent\nreplacing the interferometer by the two calibrated pigtails with mirrors.\n\n9\n\n\fback to the source through another optical fibre. A TAC (Tenelec TC863)\nwith Single Channel Analyzer selected the events with the right time interval, corresponding to two interfering possibilities when the photons take\neither both the short or both the long arm of the interferometers. We obtained typically 20 kcts/s single count rate plus 45 kcts/s dark count rates.\nThis lead to a mean value of 10 coincidences per second. With the 10 nm\nFWHM interference filter inserted, we obtained 2 kcts singles and about 3\ncoincidences per second. The interferometers were temperature controlled.\nInterferometer A was kept at a constant temperature of 30o C. The temperature of interferometer B scanned between 30.5 and 37.5 0 C. This produced\na variation of the phase of about 10*2\u03c0 and therefore allowed us to record\nthe coincidences as a function of the phase. The path length difference was\nmeasured to be equal when the temperature was 34o C. The wheel was a 20\ncm diameter aluminium disk of 1 cm thickness directly driven by a brushless\n250W DC motor (Maxon EC). It turned vertically at 10000 rpm leading to\na tangent speed of 105m/s. The fiber pointed from the top on the blackened\nouter rim of the wheel. The wheel placed at Bellevue was oriented with a\ncompass to make it run away or towards the other observer at Bernex.\n\n5\n\nMeasurements and Results\n\nWe measured the path length difference between link A and B with the\nlow coherence reflectometer. We found that the measurements were quite\nreproducible on short term, however, the length difference could vary by up\nto a few mm per hour. Actually we found that Bernex was drifting further\naway during the daytime, probably due to the fact that link A was more\nexposed to the daily temperature rise.\nOne possibility to test for the breakdown of the quantum correlation\nwould be to measure the 2-photon interference visibility, move one absorber\nslightly closer, repeat the measurement and so on. As discussed above (\nsee Table 1), to limit dispersion effects and to obtain a good timing, we\nintroduced a 10 nm (FWHM) interference bandpass filter after the source,\nreducing the coincidence count rate to some 3 cts/s. Hence to get a reasonable measurement statistics we needed some 100 sec integration time per\nmeasurement point, and some 10 points to see one interference fringe to\ndetermine the visibility, hence the measurement time was about 20 minutes.\nSince we couldn't simultaneously measure the path difference and since the\nuncertainty in distance after 20 min was more than 1 mm, it was difficult to\n\n10\n\n\fmake a scan in distance with a spatial resolution better than 1mm. So we\ndecided to renounce to a manual distance scan and to take profit of the natural temperature induced drift. This drift proved to be monotonous in one\nsense during the day and in the other sense during the night. So we almost\naligned the paths knowing that due to daily the drift will perfectly aligned\nin certain moment later in time. We started then to record the interference\nfringes of the coincidences by homogeneously varying the phase. Finally we\nconfirmed with a second position measurement after a few hours that the\npath lengths really passed through the presumed equilibrium. Then, we analyzed the interference fringes and looked for periods of reduced visibilities\nduring the measurement.\nFigure 6 shows typical data taken over 6 hours while the optical link\nto Bernex lengthened by 2 mm with respect to the one to Bellevue. The\ndifference of the optical path lenghts, expressed in \u03b4t, was varying from + 8\nto -1.3 ps. Positive values mean that the detections occured first in Bernex.\nIn the moving Bellevue reference frame the detections happened first in\nBellevue over the entire scan range, as indicated by the negative values of\n\u03b4t\u2032 on the upper time scale. Despite this different time ordering no reduced\nvisibility is observed. Inevitably, the curves show high statistical fluctuations\ndue to the low count rate. In spite of this, one can state that the visibilitiy\nof the two photon interferogram remains constant. Especially, a reduced\nvisibility over a scan span of 1 mm (corresponding to 5 ps) should easily be\nnoticed. After substraction of the 237\u00b15 cts/100s accidental coincidences,\nthe fit of Fig 2 shows a constant fringe visibility of 83%, large enough for\na violation of Bell's inequality. Note however, that hidden variables are no\nissue in this work.\nFigure 7 shows a scan over a longer period (14 hours overnight) and larger\nscan range. This time the wheel was turning in the other direction (towards\nBernex) and the optical link to Bernex shortened by 20mm. Comparing\nthe two time scales we find a period in the left part of the scan where\nwe have negative values below and positive ones above. Hence, we have\nagain a different time ordering, now both observers suppose to make the\nmeasurement after the other. Again, there is no evident drop of the visibility\nover a period of 10 ps, i.e. over roughly two fringes, assuming a rather\nhomogenous scan rate. This scan over such a long period shows the problems\nof the experiment. The period of the fringes can vary due to small drifts of\nthe pump laser frequency. The photon counters may have varying efficiency\nand dark count level. The slowly mounting line of accidentals is due to the\nfact that we measured higher darkcount rates at the end of the experiment,\n11\n\n\fpossibly due to increased temperature of one of the detector, since there\nwas little liquid nitrogen left. Finally, the visibility may slightly decrease\ndue a drift of the coincidence window discriminating the three temporal\npeaks of the Franson interferogram. Moreover, during a long scan some\nartefact are probable, as the the considerably higher peak after one third of\nthe scan (sombody switching the lights on in the Swissom station?). The\narrow indicates the moment when the scan of the phase by scanning the\ntemperature of the Bernex interferometer changed the direction. Altogether\nwe recorded over 20 tracks similar to those presented in Fig. 6 and 7 and\nno reproducable effect on the visibility could be determined.\nThe Figures 6 and 7 can also be used to estimate the lower bound for\nthe speed of quantum information. At a certain time the two paths are\nperfectely equal and the lower bound could be arbitrarly high. In practice\ntwo factors limit this lower bound. First, we assume that at least one fringe\nshould vanish to be able to state a reduced visibility. In Fig. 6, for instance,\nwe observe 7 fringes for 10 ps delay. So the minimum time difference is\nsay 1.5 ps. The second factor, the temporal spread of the photons, is the\ndetermining one in our case. We estimate it to be smaller than 5 ps. The\nlower speed limit becomes then:\nm\n2\n10.6 km\n\u2248 2 * 1015 = 107 c\n5 ps\ns\n3\n\n(16)\n\nWe also performed measurements with two Ge APD's precisely aligned instead of the absorbing surfaces showing the same evidence. Further we\nremoved the interference filter limiting the bandwith. The curve (Fig. 8)\nshows a high visibility over the whole scan range. However, in this case the\nphotons have approximately 70 nm FWHM and we have to assume some 100\nps spread. You may feel more confident with this measurement, since only\nreal detectors and no black surfaces are involved. However, the moment of\nthe collapse of the wavefunction is better defined in a black surface. We can\nassume that the lifetime of excited levels of molecules of the paint is very\nshort, i.e. that the absorbed photon energy is transformed to heat within\nless than 1 ps. In contrary, APD photon counters have a time jitter in the\norder of 300 ps, to some extent due to the fact that created electron-hole\npair in the absorbing takes more or less time to diffuse to the multiplying\nregion. But it's only there, where the irreversible proces from a quantum\nstate to a macroscopic state occurs, which is our definition of the collapse.\nSo, in fact we have an additional uncertainty in the timing of the collapse in\nthe order of 100 ps, the same order of magnitude as the dispersion induced\n12\n\n\fspread. The lower speed limit becomes then 13 106 c.\nOne can assume that the collapse happens in some preferred frame,\nwhich is not the frame of Geneva-Bellevue-Bernex. A reasonable candidate\nis the frame of the cosmic background radiation. An analysis of our data\nshows that for this frame a lower speed limit for the quantum information\nof 1.5x104 c can be given [25, 24].\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nEntanglement is the main resource of Quantum Information Processing and\nis at the core of the uneasiness many people face with the quantum world.\nIt thus deserves to be widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally.\nIn this work we have presented results from a first experiment in which both\nthe relativity of timing and entanglement of spatially separated systems are\ncentral. Indeed, in the tested configuration the time ordering of the two\nmeasurements of the quantum systems depend on the reference frame defined by the two \"measurement apparatuses\". Each apparatus consists of\nan interferometer with two outputs. One output is connected to a standard\nphoton counting detector, while the other output is connected to a \"passive\ndetector\", i.e. a detector which irreversibly absorbs the photon, but spread\nthe information in the environment without registering a signal in a form\nreadable for humans. We have argued that such \"passive detectors\" have\nthe same physical effect on the photon and that the result of this effect can\nbe read of the active detector at the other output (if the photon does not\nshow up at one output, it is at the other output). Furthermore we have\nargued that the crucial part of each measurement apparatus is the detector\nwhich encounters the photon's wave-packet first. Hence, we arranged the\nexperiment such that the crucial parts of each measurement are the \"passive\ndetectors\" and that these are in relative motion such that the time ordering of the impacts of the two entangled photons on them depends on the\nreference frame defined by these moving \"passive detectors\".\nThe results are always in accordance with QM, re-enforcing our confidence in the possibility to base future understanding of our world and\nfuture technology on quantum principles. To achieve our experiment we\nhad to set the 2-photon source very precisely at the center between the two\nmeasurements, i.e. the two impacts on the detectors were simultaneous in\nthe Geneva reference frame to within 5 ps. This sets a lower bound on the\nspeed on quantum information to 107 c, i.e. seven orders of magnitude larger\n\n13\n\n\fthan the speed of light.\nThe description of \"quantum measurements\" is notoriously difficult and\ncontroversial. The results we have presented make it even more delicate to\ngive a realistic description with \"real collapses\". On the other side, the reasoning we have followed opens new ways to test quantum mechanics and its\nweird description of \"measurements\". The assumptions we made to achieve\nthis first experiment can and should be criticized. For instance, the assumption that the detector is the crucial step in a measurement is at odds with\nthe idea that the collapse takes place in the reference frame determines by\nthis detector, as discussed in appendix B. But at least these assumptions\nlead to a feasible experiment and will hopefully trigger new proposals.\nIt is a great time for quantum physics. Both its foundations and its potential applications are deeply explored by a growing community of physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers. We explored\nexperimentally some of the most counter intuitive predictions of quantum\ntheory, stressing the tension with relativity. Our results contribute to the renewed interest for experimental challenges to the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics and is relevant for the realist-positivist debate. \"Experimental\nmetaphysics\" questions [18] like \"what about the concept of states?\", \"the\nconcept of causalities?\" will have to be (re)considered taking into account\nthe results presented in this article. For example, our results make it more\ndifficult to view the \"projection postulate\" as a compact description of a\nreal physical phenomenon [19, 20].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work would not have been possible without the financial support of\nthe \"Fondation Odier de psycho-physique\". It also profited from support\nby Swisscom and the Swiss National Science Foundation. We would like\nto thank A. Suarez and V. Scarani for very stimulating discussions and H.\nInamori for preparing work during his stay in our lab.\n\n14\n\n\fAppendices\nA\n\nProbabilities for moving observers\n\nLet P and Q denote two projector acting on spatially separated Alice and\nBob systems, respectively. We shall use the identification P \u2248 P \u2297 11 and\n11\u2297Q \u2248 Q. If the measurements corresponding to P and Q are either beforeafter or after-before, then the test-theory predicts the same probability as\nstandard QM, with \u03c8 \u2208 H1 \u2297 H2 the usual quantum state:\nP rob(+ + |b \u2212 a) =< Q >P \u03c8 < P >\u03c8\n\n(17)\n\n= P rob(+ + |a \u2212 b) =< P >Q\u03c8 < Q >\u03c8\n\n(18)\n\n= P rob(+ + |QM ) =< P \u2297 Q >\u03c8\n\n(19)\n\nIf, however, both measurements are before we postulate (inspired by Suarez\n& Scarani):\nP rob(+ + |b \u2212 b) =< P >\u03c8 < Q >\u03c8 6= P rob(+ + |QM )\n\n(20)\n\nThe case after-after is the most delicate to guess. Inspired by Suarez' intuition that in such a case each particle tries to guess what the other would\nhave done if it were before (as if the information from the other particle\nwould have got lost), we try the following postulate:\nP rob(+ + |a \u2212 a)\n\n=\n\n< P \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u03c8 < Q >P \u03c8\n\n+ < P \u2297 Q\u22a5 > \u03c8 < P > Q \u22a5 \u03c8 < Q > P \u03c8\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u03c8 < Q >P \u22a5 \u03c8\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q\u22a5 > \u03c8 < P > Q \u22a5 \u03c8 < Q > P \u22a5 \u03c8\n6=\nwhere < P >Q\u03c8 \u2261\n\n<Q\u03c8|P |Q\u03c8>\n<Q\u03c8|Q\u03c8>\n\n(21)\n\nP rob(+ + |QM )\n=\n\n<P \u2297Q>\u03c8\n<Q>\u03c8 .\n\nThe idea is that Alice system\n\nevaluate the projector P in either the state Q\u03c8 or Q\u22a5 \u03c8 depending on its\nguess of Bob' system outcome. The situation is clearly symmetric. Hence\nthe 4 alternatives are weighted according to the standard outcome probabilities (it does not matter whether it is Alice who guesses that Bob was first,\nor whether it is Bob who assumes that Alice was first). In (21 each line corresponds to one possible guess, the first term giving the corresponding guess\nprobability (e.g. < P \u2297 Q >\u03c8 for both guessing that theother had a positive\n15\n\n\foutcom) and the two last terms the corresponding outcomes probabilities\n(e.g. < P >Q\u03c8 < Q >P \u03c8 ).\nThe other probabilities for the after-after configuration follow: e.g. P rob(+\u2212\n|a \u2212 a obtains from (21) by replacing Q with Q\u22a5 .\nA first consistency check is for product states: if \u03c8 = \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2, then from\n(21) follows P rob(+ + |a \u2212 a) =< P >\u03b1 < Q >\u03b2 .\nAs second consistency check let us compute:\nP rob(+ + |a \u2212 a) + P rob(+ \u2212 |a \u2212 a) =\n= < P \u2297 Q >\u03c8 (< P >Q\u03c8 < Q >P \u03c8 + < P >Q\u03c8 < Q\u22a5 >P \u03c8 )\n+ < P \u2297 Q\u22a5 >\u03c8 (< P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8 < Q >P \u03c8 + < P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8 < Q\u22a5 >P \u03c8 )\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q >\u03c8 (< P >Q\u03c8 < Q >P \u22a5 \u03c8 + < P >Q\u03c8 < Q\u22a5 >P \u22a5 \u03c8 )\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q\u22a5 >\u03c8 (< P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8 < Q >P \u22a5 \u03c8 + < P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8 < Q\u22a5 >P(22)\n\u22a5\u03c8 )\n= < P \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u03c8 + < P \u2297 Q\u22a5 >\u03c8 < P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u03c8 + < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q\u22a5 >\u03c8 < P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8\n\u22a5\n\n= < Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u03c8 + < Q >\u03c8 < P >Q\u22a5 \u03c8\n\n(24)\n\n= < P >\u03c8\n\n(25)\n\nAccordingly, the local probabilities follow the standard laws, as they should!\nWe compute now the correlation function\nE(P, Q)\n\n(23)\n\n=\n\nP rob(++) + P rob(\u2212\u2212) \u2212 P rob(+\u2212) \u2212 P rob(\u2212+) (26)\n\n=\n\n< P \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < \u03c3P >Q\u03c8 < \u03c3Q >P \u03c8\n\n+ < P \u2297 Q \u22a5 > \u03c8 < \u03c3P > Q \u22a5 \u03c8 < \u03c3Q > P \u03c8\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q >\u03c8 < \u03c3P >Q\u03c8 < \u03c3Q >P \u22a5 \u03c8\n+ < P \u22a5 \u2297 Q \u22a5 > \u03c8 < \u03c3P > Q \u22a5 \u03c8 < \u03c3Q > P \u22a5 \u03c8\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c3P \u2261 P \u2212 P \u22a5 and \u03c3Q \u2261 Q \u2212 Q\u22a5 . Let us illustrate this conjecture for\nthe singlet state with \u03c3P = ~a~\u03c3 and \u03c3Q = ~b~\u03c3 :\n\u0011\n1 \u2212 ~a~b \u0010 ~ 2\n(~ab) + (\u2212~a~b)2\n4\n\u0011\n1 + ~a~b \u0010 ~\n+\n(~ab)(\u2212~a~b) + (\u2212~a~b)(~a~b)\n4\n= \u2212(~a~b)3\n\nE(~a, ~b) =\n\n16\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\n\fThis may be more difficult to distinguish experimentally from the beforebefore conjecture. Note that if ~a and ~b are parallel (or anti-parallel), then the\nmaximal anti-correlation (correlation) are predicted. This is in accordance\nwith the idea that each particle guesses the other's output.\n\nB\n\nDetectors as choice device and super-luminal\ncommunication\n\nIn this appendix we elaborate on the assumption that the collapse (i.e.\nthe outcome of the measurement) is determined by the detector. We show\nthat using this assumption one can device a situation in which quantum\nnonlocality could be activated, that is use to signal at arbitrary high speeds.\nLet us return to figures 1. Why not leave the interferometers close to\nthe source and just put the absorbing surfaces at a distance. The detectors\ncan then also stay by the source, provided a long fiber spool is inserted to\nensure that the detections occur after the collapse (see Fig. 1c). So we\nare looking at coincidences between two detectors side by side. When the\nwheel is turning at Bob's the correlation should disappear. Since Bob can\nbe very far away from the source and the detection of photons must occur\njust shortly after the potential arrival of the photons at Alice and Bob. Bob\ncould, by switching on and off the wheel, send signals back to the source at\nsuperluminal speed.\nThe peaceful coexistence between quantum mechanics and relativity [3]\nis one of the most remarkable facts of physics! It is notoriously difficult to\nmodify quantum mechanics without activating quantum non-locality, hence\nwithout breaking this peaceful co-existence [21, 22]. Weinberg has argued\non this base that quantum mechanics is part of the final theory [23]! In this\nappendix we see once again that a proposed modification to basic quantum\nmechanics requires also a radical modification of relativity. However, it is\npossible that it is not the detector that triggers the collapse. The photons\ncould take the decision already at the beamsplitter and go out through one\noutput port, like in the Bohm-de-Bloglie pilot wave picture [26] (which much\ninspired Suarez). With the beam-splitter as choice-device superluminal signaling is not possible (to our knowledge). A corresponding experimental\ntest would be more demanding, a beam-splitter would have to be in motion.\nA clever way-out could be the use of an acousto-optical modulator representing a beam-splitter moving with the speed of the acoustic wave. We are\nworking on such an experiment.\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A. Einstein, B. Podolsky & N. Rosen, Can quantum-mechanical description\nof physical reality be considered complete?, Phys.
