Formation of local\nmoments as well as a rapid suppression of the spin gap\nwas obtained theoretically in a Heisenberg ladder using\nthe vacant-site impurity model [14]. Further numerical\nsimulations [15] have led to an effective model of local\nmoments interacting via an exchange interaction which\nrapidly decays with the impurity distance.\n\nImpurity doping of the high-Tc cuprate superconductors is an effective tool for exploring the low temperature\nphysics of these strongly correlated electronic systems.\nThe similarities or differences observed upon doping nonmagnetic zinc (Zn) and lithium (Li) ions must find their\nexplanations both in the strongly correlated nature of\ntheir host and in the peculiarities of each dopant. For\nexample, when doped into the antiferromagnetic (AF)\nphase of La2 CuO4 , Li [1] is far more effective at suppressing the N\u00e9el temperature than Zn [2], although both\nenter the same planar Cu(2) site. However, Li, by releasing an extra hole (due to the difference of formal valence\nof Cu2+ and Li+ ) can theoretically lead to an essential\nperturbation [3] while Zn was shown to only slightly enhance the AF correlations in its vicinity [4].\nStrikingly, despite different behavior in AF systems,\nnon-magnetic Zn and Li ions behave quite similarly in\nconducting YBa2 Cu3 O6+x (YBCO) by inducing local\nmagnetic moments [5]. This suggests that, in the case of\nLi, the extra hole is not bound, unlike La2 Cu1\u2212x Lix O4 .\nThe induced moment sits predominantly on the four\nnearest neighbor (NN) Cu of the dopant and exhibits\nstatic [6] and dynamic [7] susceptibilities reminiscent of\na Kondo-like behavior with a large range of Kondo temperatures. In fact, screening of the induced moment by\na conduction hole resulting in an impurity-hole bound\nstate was predicted theoretically [9] using a description\nin terms of a vacant site embedded in a correlated t-J\nhost. In superconducting Li-doped YBCO the moment\nwas found to be weakly modified below Tc [8]. Possible\nreduction of screening due to pairing was also investigated theoretically [10].\nSpin ladders [11] offer a perfect system to investigate impurity doping in a spin liquid or Resonating Valence Bond [12] (RVB) state, i.e. a state with short AF\ncorrelations and a spin gap. Clearly, a reliable microscopic description of dopants in ladders would greatly\ncontribute to the understanding of their two dimensional\n(2D) analogs as well. In fact, Zn doping into the spin1/2 Heisenberg two-leg ladder SrCu2 O3 leads to local\n\n4\n5\n\n2\n3\n\n1 2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic representations of a Li-doped spin ladder.

(b) Lowest triplet excitation:\ndopant-magnon bound state.\n\nDoping Li into a two-leg spin ladder is still an open\nand fascinating problem both experimentally and theoretically. Novel physics can be expected due to the additional (w.r.t the case of Zn) intrinsic doping associated\nwith the substitution of a divalent (Cu2+ ) by a monovalent (Li+ ) ion. In this Letter, we address this issue\nusing a specific vacant-site model for Li+ embedded into\na correlated host. We show that Li doping does not introduce low-energy spin excitations as in the case of Zn\nbut instead leads to the formation of a magnon-impurity\n1\n\n\fbound state (BS) just below the spin gap of the undoped\nladder. This suggests that, unlike Zn-doped ladders, Lidoped ladders would keep a robust spin liquid character\nat low temperature.\nFor dilute concentrations, a single dopant in the geometry of Figs. 1 suffices. We model the substitution of a\nCu2+ ion by a Li+ atom by a vacant inert site which is\na hard-core potential for holes. Because of the different\nvalences of Cu2+ and Li+ a hole is injected into the spin\nladder and it feels a static attractive Coulomb potential\ncentered on the Li+ site. A realistic Hamiltonian reads:\nH=J\n\u2032\nX\n\n\u2212t\n\n\u2032\nX\n\n1\n(Si * Sj \u2212 ni nj )\n4\n<i,j>\n\n(c\u2020i,\u03c3 cj,\u03c3 + h.c.) \u2212 V\n\nX\n\n<i,j>,\u03c3\n\nFirst, we investigate the localization of the injected\nhole vs the strength of the Coulomb potential. Following\nRef. [9], we calculate the so-called hole-dopant binding\nenergy defined as,\n\u2206S=0\n= E0 (1h, 1i) + E0 (0h, 0i)\n1 imp, 1 h\n\u2212(E0 (1h, 0i) + E0 (0h, 1i)) ,\n\nwhere E0 (n h, m i) is the GS energy of a ladder with n = 0\nor 1 (m = 0 or 1) holes (dopants). This quantity is negative when the hole and Li ion form a stable bound state.\nSince Li-doping results in the simultaneous removal of\ntwo spins we expect a magnetically inert state i.e. a singlet (S = 0). As seen on Fig. 2(a) a stable BS is found for\nalmost all couplings, even in the case V = 0. It should\nbe noticed that the magnitude of the binding energy is\nslightly larger than in the case of a 2D planar geometry [9]. Fig. 1(a) offers a pictorial representation of such\na state where the absence of any local moment can be\nclearly understood from the RVB nature of the host (all\nremaining spins are paired up in singlets). Although,\nour calculation shows that a single Li-dopant binds the\ninjected hole in its vicinity, caution is required at a finite\nconcentration. In this case the possibility of other \"decay channels\" has to be considered, e.g. 2 holes from 2\ndopants recombining into an itinerant hole pair [16]. This\npossibility is ruled out by the fact that the dopant-hole\nbinding energy is always smaller than half of the hole-pair\nbinding energy \u22062 holes calculated on an undoped ladder\nas seen on Fig. 2(a), even when V = 0. At low concentrations we then expect decoupled quenched dopants\neach binding one hole. Since the spatial extensions of the\nisolated BS's are quite small (typically \u03be = 2 to 4 rungs\neven when V = 0), the system is expected to remain\ninsulating up to large doping.\nWe now turn to the magnetic properties of the Lidoped spin ladder in order to compare with Zn doping.\nFor this purpose, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor S(q, \u03c9) as measured in Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) experiments for an undoped ladder (shown\non Fig. 3(a)), a Zn-doped ladder (modeling Zn as a neutral vacant site and shown on Fig. 3(b)) and a Li-doped\nladder described by Eq. (1) (shown on Fig. 3(c)). Note\nthat S(q, \u03c9) quantifies the spectral weight given by the\nmatrix element | n|SqZ |0 |2 between the singlet GS |0\nand the magnetic excitation |n at energy \u03c9. The RVB\npicture, in which spins are paired up into short range\nsinglets (for example on the rungs as in Figs. 1), turns\nout to give a nice qualitative understanding of the magnetic properties. In the undoped ladder, a triplet excitation (magnon) is well described by exciting a rung singlet\ninto a triplet. Fig. 3(a) clearly shows the single magnon\ndispersion with a minimum at q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) which defines\nthe spin gap \u22060S [17] of the undoped ladder. Introducing a Zn atom on a rung releases a free spin-1/2 which\nleads to zero-energy spin fluctuations predominantly at\nq = (\u03c0, \u03c0) as seen in Fig. 3(b) while the undoped ladder\nmagnon mode still survives. When two Zn dopants are\n\n(1)\n\n(1 \u2212 nlI ) ,\n\nlI\n\nwhere the notations are standard and the prime means\nthat the sum over NN links < ij > is restricted to the\nbonds not connected to the dopant site. We have modeled the attractive hole potential by a static NN potential\n\u2212V as depicted on Figs. 1. The summation over lI only\nruns over the NN sites of the impurity. Note that, for\nsimplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of a magnetically isotropic ladder i.e. with equal rung and leg couplings, J.

Spin structure factors S(q, \u03c9) calculated on 2\u00d710\nladders. Data for q\u22a5 = \u03c0 only are shown. From bottom\nto top, the different curves correspond to decreasing qk momenta, from q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) (bottom) to q = (0, \u03c0) (top). For\nclarity, reducing scaling factors (as indicated) are applied on\nsome curves. (a) Undoped periodic ladder; (b) Spin ladder\ndoped with a single Zn impurity (full line) or two Zn impurities separated by the maximum distance on the same leg\n(dashed line); (c) Ladder doped with a single Li impurity with\nt = 2J and V /t = 0.5.\n\nour other finding that the energy costs (i.e. the absolute\nvalue of the related binding energies [18]) of the two virtual decay processes leading either to a free hole and a\nneutral dopant-magnon complex or to a free magnon and\na dopant-hole complex are quite different in magnitude\nas seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c). In fact, the attraction\n\u2212V has the opposite effect on the two quantities; while\nincreasing V binds the hole more strongly, it also limits the ability of the hole to reduce its kinetic energy by\nmoving in the spin polarized background of the magnon,\nand so the binding energy of the magnon to the dopanthole complex is reduced [19]. From the analysis of the\nbehavior of the magnetic size of the BS (deduced from\nFig. 4(b)) or alternatively directly from its binding energy plotted on Fig. 2(c), we conclude that above a critical value of V (typically one gets VC /t \u2243 2 for J/t = 0.5)\nthe magnon escapes from the dopant.\nFor completeness, we calculate also the local density of\nstate (DOS) in the vicinity of the dopant. Since this DOS\nmight be accessible experimentally by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy it can test the validity of the model.\nResults are shown in Fig. 5 corresponding to spatially\nresolved DOS spectra in the vicinity of the dopant. The\n\u03c9 > 0 (\u03c9 < 0) spectra give the weights of the neutral\n(charged) target S = 1/2 states which are accessible by\nremoving the hole (adding an extra hole) in the singlet\nGS. The large peak seen at vanishing positive energy on\nsite number 1 i.e. on the same rung as the dopant corresponds to a resonant magnetic spinon-dopant BS. Other\nspinon-dopant resonances of higher energies are also seen\nwith larger spatial ranges i.e. spread over two or three\nsites of the leg opposite to the dopant. Similarly, \u03c9 < 0\nresonances are seen when adding an extra hole on the\nsame leg as the dopant e.g on sites number 3 and 5. The\nlowest resonance energy (in absolute value) is obtained\n\nintroduced, our data, in agreement with Ref. [14], show\nthat the two local S=1/2 moments experience a weak effective exchange interaction, Jeff , which decays rapidly\nwith separation. In that case, a small spectral weight at\nq = (\u03c0, \u03c0) and low energy \u03c9 \u223c Jeff below the undoped\nspin gap is seen. The case of Li-doping shown on Fig. 3(c)\nis drastically different with no weight at small energy.\nIndeed, since a Li+ dopant introduces simultaneously a\nbound hole, it does not release a free spin as for Zn but\nrather produces a new type of excitation located just below the unperturbed spin gap, namely a collective bound\nstate of a (let us say rung) magnon with the hole and the\nLi ion as naively depicted on Fig. 1(b). Its binding energy\ndefined as the energy separation w.r.t. the free magnon\nenergy \u22060S remains in general quite small (in absolute\nvalue) as seen directly in Fig. 3(b) (and qualitatively in\nFig. 2(c)). Therefore a drastic reduction of the spin gap\ndoes not occur in this case.\nThe physical origin of this BS is of particular interest. Simple qualitative arguments as well as extensive\nnumerical data show that the origin of binding in this\nchannel can be attributed to the hole kinetic energy gain\nassociated with the spin polarization. DMRG calculations show that the spatial extents of the charge and\nspin perturbations associated with the BS are quite different. While the hole is localized on a scale of a few\nrungs from the dopant as seen in Fig. 4(a), the distribution of the rung magnetization can extend to large\ndistances as seen in Fig. 4(b). This is in agreement with\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis predicts a clear distinction\nbetween the magnetic properties of the two non-magnetic\nions, Zn2+ and Li+ when doped into spin liquids due to\nthe binding of a hole in the latter case. Experiments to\ntest these predictions are proposed.\nWe thank Matthias Troyer for valuable discussions.\nSRW thanks the NSF for support under grant DMR9870930.

White, Phys. Rev. B 53, 52 (1996).\n[18] The binding energies related to these two decay processes\nand plotted in Figs. 2(b),(c) can be defined as \u2206S=1\n1 imp, 1 h =\nE1 (1h, 1i) + E0 (0h, 0i) \u2212 (E0 (1h, 0i) + E0 (0h, 1i)) and\nas \u2206S \u2212 \u22060S = E1 (1h, 1i) + E0 (0h, 0i) \u2212 (E0 (1h, 1i) +\nE1 (0h, 0i)) where E1 is the energy in the triplet sector.\n[19] There is in fact a close similarity to the case of an itinerant magnon-hole-pair BS where a negative next NN\nhopping has a role comparable (but inverse) to \u2212V ; see\nD. Poilblanc et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, R14633 (2000).\n\n\u22126\nFIG. 5. Local DOS around a Li dopant obtained by ED\nof a 2 \u00d7 9 ladder with J/t = 0.5 and V /t = 0.5. Each panel\ncorresponds to a site in the vicinity of the dopant (site labels\ncorrespond to those of Fig. 1(a)). Occupied (empty) electronic states are shaded (left blank). Note that, for a dopant\nconcentration x, the total \u03c9 > 0 (resp. \u03c9 < 0) integrated\nweight scales as x (resp. 21 \u2212 x2 ).\n\nwhen the second hole is added on sites number 3 next to\nthe dopant. Note also that the local \u03c9 > 0 (\u03c9 < 0) integrated weight provides directly the local hole (electron)\ndensity in the GS. Hence our data show that the bound\nhole is located mainly on the opposite leg to the dopant\nand extends roughly over three sites.\nOur theory can be directly tested, if Li can be substituted for Cu in the ladder compound, SrCu2 O3 . The\nextra bound hole around a Li dopant should ensure that a\nfree local S=1/2 moment is not created in contrast to the\ncase of Zn doping. Hence we predict that SrCu2\u2212x Lix O3\nshould not order antiferromagnetically at low temperature unlike SrCu2\u2212x Znx O3 (Ref. [13]). Further the nature of the magnon-dopant BS, the charge distribution\nand local DOS could also be examined experimentally\nin these systems. However, our analysis raises interesting questions regarding the close similarity between Li\nand Zn substitution reported in superconducting YBCO\nsamples. In particular if we interpret the spin gap phase\nin underdoped YBa2 Cu3 O6.6 as a doped d-RVB phase,\nthen there should be a close similarity to the behavior\nof the doped ladder. However Bobroff et al. [6,5] report a free S=1/2 appears for both Zn and Li doping of\nthese samples. A possible way to reconcile this apparent\ncontradiction is to postulate that Li+ does not bind a\nhole in YBa2 Cu3\u2212x Lix O6.6 , but does in La2 Cu1\u2212x Lix O4 .\nThis could occur if the mobile O2\u2212 -ions in the chains\nwere repelled from the Li+ -ions on the planes. A test\nof this hypothesis can be made by doping Li+ and Zn2+\nin YBa2 Cu4 O8 which as a stoichiometric compound has\nno mobile O-ions. Our analysis then predicts free S=1/2\nmoments only for Zn-doping and not for Li-doping in this\ncase.\n4\n\n\f"}
