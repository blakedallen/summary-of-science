We briefly discuss\nhow an INS's spin period evolves under influence of interaction with turbulized\ninterstellar medium.\nTo investigate statistical properties of the INS population we calculate a census\nof INSs in our Galaxy. We infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity of NSs,\n< V >\u223c(200-300) km s\u22121 . The same conclusion is reached for both a constant\nmagnetic field (B \u223c 1012 G) and for a magnetic field decaying exponentially with a\ntimescale \u223c 109 yr. These results, moreover, constrain the fraction of low velocity\nNSs, which could have escaped pulsar statistics, to \u223cfew percents.\nThen we show that for exponential field decay the range of minimum value of\nmagnetic moment, \u03bcb : \u223c 1029.5 \u2265 \u03bcb \u2265 1028 G cm3 , and the characteristic decay\ntime, td : \u223c 108 \u2265 td \u2265 107 yrs, can be excluded assuming the standard initial\nmagnetic momentum, \u03bc0 = 1030 G cm3 , if accreting INSs are observed. For these\nparameters an INS would never reach the stage of accretion from the interstellar\nmedium even for a low space velocity of the star and high density of the ambient\nplasma. The range of excluded parameters increases for lower values of \u03bc0 .\nIt is shown that old accreting INSs become more abundant than young cooling\nINSs at X-ray fluxes below \u223c 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . We can predict that about one\naccreting INS per square degree should be observed at the Chandra and Newton flux\nlimits of \u223c 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The weak ROSAT sources, associated with INSs,\ncan be young cooling objects, if the NSs birth rate in the solar vicinity during the\nlast \u223c 106 yr was much higher than inferred from radiopulsar observations.\nKeywords: neutron stars, magnetic field, accretion\n\n1. Introduction\nDespite intensive observational campaigns, no irrefutable identification\nof an isolated accreting neutron star (NS) has been presented so far. Six\nsoft sources have been found in ROSAT fields which are most probably\nassociated to isolated radioquiet NSs. Their present X-ray and optical\ndata however do not allow an unambiguous identification of the physical\nmechanism responsible for their emission. These sources can be powered\neither by accretion of the interstellar gas onto old (\u2248 1010 yr) NSs or by\nthe release of internal energy in relatively young (\u2248 106 yr) cooling NSs\n(see (Treves et al., 2000) for a recent review). The ROSAT candidates,\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Their X-ray spectrum is soft and thermal, again as\npredicted for both accretors and coolers (Treves et al., 2000). Up to\nnow only two optical counterparts have been identified (RXJ 1856,\n(Walter and Matthews, 1997); RXJ 0720, (Kulkarni and van Kerkwijk,\n1998)) and in both cases an optical excess over the low-frequency tail\nof the black body X-ray spectrum has been reported. While detailed\nmultiwavelength observations with next-generation instruments may\nindeed be the key for assessing the true nature of these sources, other,\nindirect, approaches may be used to discriminate in favor of one of the\ntwo scenarios proposed so far.\nSince early 90s , when in (Treves and Colpi, 1991) it was suggested to\nsearch for IANSs with ROSAT satellite, several investigations on INSs\nhave been done (see for example (Madau and Blaes, 1994), (Manning\net al., 1996), and (Treves et al., 2000) for a review). Here we present\nour recent results in that field.\n\nStochastic evolution of isolated neutron stars\nOne can distinguish four main stages of INS evolution: Ejector, Propeller, Accretor and Georotator (see (Lipunov, 1992) for more detailes).\nDestiny of an INS depends on its spin period, magnetic field, spatial\nvelocity and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Schematically typical evolutionary paths can be shown on p-y diagram, where\ny = \u1e40 /\u03bc2 \u2013 gravimagnetic parameter (Fig. 1).\nAn INS normally is born as Ejector. Then it spins down, and appear\nas Propeller. At last it can reach the stage of accretion, if its spatial\nvelocity is low enough, or if the magnetic field is high.\nAs an INS evolves at the Accretor stage it more and more feels\nthe influence of the turbulized nature of the ISM (Fig. 2). Initially\nisolated accreting NS spins down due to magnetic breaking, and the\ninfluence of accreted angular momentum is small. At last, at the stage\nof accretion, when the INS spun down enough, its rotational evolution is\nmainly governed by the turbulence, and the accreting angular moment\nfluctuates.\nObservations of p and \u1e57 of isolated accreting NSs can provide us\nnot only with the information about INSs properties, but also about\ndifferent properties of the ISM itself.\n\nnew_erice.tex; 13/11/2018; 17:35; p.2\n\n\f3\n\nEvolution of Isolated Neutron Stars\n\nSpin Period\n\nG\n\nA\n\nP\n\nE\n\n1 2\n\n3\n\nGravimagnetic\nparameter\nFigure 1.

The NS spins down passing through different\nstages (Ejector, Propeller, Accretor); 2 \u2013 passing through a giant molecular cloud.\nThe accretion rate is increased for some time, and the NS makes a loop on the\ndiagram; 3 \u2013 evolution with field decay. The NS appears as Accretor due to fast\nfield decay.\n\nNeutron Star Census\nWe have investigated, (Popov et al., 2000a), how the present distribution of NSs in the different stages (Ejector, Propeller, Accretor and\nGeorotator, see (Lipunov, 1992)) depends on the star mean velocity at\nbirth (see Fig. 3). The fraction of Accretors was used to estimate the\nnumber of sources within 140 pc from the Sun which should have been\n\nnew_erice.tex; 13/11/2018; 17:35; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nSergei Popov\n\nte\n\nt cr\n\nlg t\n\np0\npe\npA\n\npcr\npeq\n\nPropeller\n\ndt= RG v\n\n/\n\nlg p\nFigure 2. Evolution of an isolated NS in turbulized interstellar medium. After\nspin-down at the Ejector stage (spin-down up to p = pE ) and short Propeller stage\n(shown with a circle) the NS appears as accretor (p > pA ). Initialy magnetic breaking\nis more important than accretion of the angular momentum from the interstellar\nmedium, and the NS constantly spins down. Then at t = tcr magnetic breaking and\nturbulent spin-up/spin-down become comparable, and spin period starts to fluctuate\ncoming to some average (\"equilibrium\") value, peq . Typical timescale for fluctuations\nis dt = RG /v, RG \u2013 radius of gravitational capture, v \u2013 spatial velocity.\n\ndetected by ROSAT. Most recent analysis of ROSAT data indicate that\nno more than \u223c 10 non\u2013optically identified sources can be accreting old\nINSs. This implies that the average velocity of the INSs population at\nbirth has to exceed \u223c 200 km s\u22121 , a figure which is consistent with\nthose derived from radio pulsars statistics. We have found that this\nlower limit on the mean kick velocity is substantially the same either\nfor a constant or a decaying B\u2013field, unless the decay timescale is\nshorter than \u223c 109 yr. Since observable accretion\u2013powered INSs are\nslow objects, our results exclude also the possibility that the present\nvelocity distribution of NSs is richer in low\u2013velocity objects with respect\nto a Maxwellian. The paucity of accreting INSs seem to lend further\nsupport in favor of NSs as fast objects.\n\nnew_erice.tex; 13/11/2018; 17:35; p.4\n\n\f5\n\nEvolution of Isolated Neutron Stars\n\nPropellers\n\nEjectors\n100.0\n0.25\n80.0\n\n0.20\n\n60.0\n\n0.15\n\n40.0\n\n0.10\n\n20.0\n\n0.05\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n200.0\n\n400.0\n\n600.0\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\nAccretors\n0.60\n\n10\n\n0.40\n\n1\n\n0.20\n\n200.0\n400.0\nVelocity, km/s\n\n400.0\n\n600.0\n\nGeorotators\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n200.0\n\n600.0\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n200.0\n400.0\nVelocity, km/s\n\n600.0\n\nFigure 3.

The dotted line shows\nthe border of the \"forbidden\" region for \u03bc0 = 5 * 1029 G cm3 .\n\ntcr = td * ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc0\n\u03bcb\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nand does not change after that.\nThe intermediate values of td (\u223c 107 \u2212 108 yrs) in combination\nwith the intermediate values of \u03bcb (\u223c 1028 \u2212 1029.5 G cm3 ) for \u03bc0 =\n1030 G cm3 can be excluded for progenitors of isolated accreting NSs\nbecause NSs with such parameters would always remain on the Ejector\nstage and never pass to the accretion stage (see Fig. 4). Even if all modern candidates are not accreting objects, the possibility of limitations\nof magnetic field decay models based on future observations of isolated\naccreting NSs should be addressed.\n\nnew_erice.tex; 13/11/2018; 17:35; p.6\n\n\fEvolution of Isolated Neutron Stars\n\n7\n\nFor higher \u03bc0 NSs should reach the stage of Propeller (i.e. p = pE ,\nwhere pE \u2013 is the Ejector period) even for td < 108 yrs, for weaker fields\nthe \"forbidden\" region becomes wider. Critical period, pE , corresponds\nto transition from the Propeller stage to the stage of Ejector, and is\nabout 10-25 seconds for typical parameters. The results are dependent\non the initial magnetic field, \u03bc0 , the ISM density, n, and NSs velocity,\nV . So here different ideas can be investigated.\nIn fact the limits obtained above are even stronger than they could\nbe in nature, i.e. \"forbidden\" regions can be wider, because we did not\ntake into account that NSs can spend some significant time (in the case\nwith field decay) at the propeller stage (the spin-down rate at this stage\nis very uncertain, see the list of formulae, for example, in (Lipunov and\nPopov, 1995) or (Lipunov, 1992)). The calculations of this effect for\ndifferent models of non-exponential field decay were made separately\n(Popov and Prokhorov, 2001).\nNote that there is another reason due to which a very fast decay\ndown to small values of \u03bcb can also be excluded, because this would\nlead to a huge amount of accreting isolated NSs in drastic contrast\nwith observations. This situation is similar to the \"turn-off\" of the\nmagnetic field of an INS (i.e., quenching any magnetospheric effect on\nthe accreting matter). So for any velocity and density distributions we\nshould expect significantly more accreting isolated NSs than we know\nfrom ROSAT observations (of course, for high velocities X-ray sources\nwill be very dim, but close NSs can be observed even for velocities\n\u223c 100 km s\u22121 ).\n\nLog N \u2013 Log S distribution\nIn this section we briefly present our new results on INSs, (Popov et\nal., 2000b).\nWe compute and compare the log N \u2013 log S distribution of both accreting and cooling NSs, to establish the relative contribution of the two\npopulations to the observed number counts. Previous studies derived\nthe log N \u2013 log S distribution of accretors ((Treves and Colpi, 1991);\n(Madau and Blaes, 1994); (Manning et al., 1996)) assuming a NSs\nvelocity distribution rich in slow stars (v < 100 km s\u22121 ). More recent\nmeasurements of pulsar velocities (e.g. (Lyne and Lorimer, 1994)) and\nupper limits on the observed number of accretors in ROSAT surveys\npoint, however, to a larger NS mean velocity (see (Treves et al., 2000)\nfor a critical discussion). Recently in (Ne\u00fchauser and Tr\u00fcmper, 1999)\nthe authors compared the number count distribution of the ROSAT\nisolated NS candidates with those of accretors and coolers.

In many cases INSs can show different\neffects in the most \"pure\" form: without influence of huge accretion\nrate, for example.\nWe tried to show how these objects are related with models of\nmagnetic field decay, and with recent and future X-ray observations.\nObserved candidates propose \"non-standard\" properties of NSs. Future observations with XMM (Newton) and Chandra satellites can give\nmore important facts.\n\nnew_erice.tex; 13/11/2018; 17:35; p.9\n\n\f10\n\nSergei Popov\n\nINSs without usual radio pulsar activity (SGRs, AXPs, compact Xray sources in SNRs, dim ROSAT candidates, Geminga, dim sources\nin globular clusters) together show \"non-standard\" or better say more\ncomplete picture of NS nature. Future investigations are strongly wanted.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank my co-authors Monica Colpi, Vladimir Lipunov, Mikhail\nProkhorov, Aldo Treves and Roberto Turolla.
