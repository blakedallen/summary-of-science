Fields interacting nonlinearly provide the binding without invoking any phenomenological elements. Einstein and\nRosen[1] pointed out many years ago that particles should be contained within a field theory\nand not exist as independent entities. Rosen[2] made considerable progress in implementing\nsuch a program in a gauge-invariant manner by minimally coupling a scalar field to the\nMaxwell field. However, the soliton solutions yielded negative masses. Later[3], neutral\nquantized particle states of positive mass were found and a more complicated model invoking\nup to three scalar fields coupled to the Maxwell field was shown to be capable of modeling\nthe known massive leptons[4]. However, the particles were spinless and the view then was\nthat a subsequent quantization of the theory would induce spin.\nIn 1991, one of the present authors[5] suggested an alternative route to elementary particle\nmodelling, namely as solitons of Dirac\u2013Maxwell theory. Since Dirac\u2013Maxwell theory had\nbeen so successful in describing electron spin and magnetic moment, predicting the existence\nof the positron and refining the energy levels in interacting systems such as hydrogen, it\n\n\fseemed reasonable that this might successfully extend to a self-interacting soliton structure\nto model the elementary particles themselves. Spin would already exist in such a model via\nthe spinor structure of the wave function. Shortly thereafter, such solitons were found and\ntheir properties studied[6]. A few years later, Lisi[7] independently discovered some of the\nresults in[6]. Recently, there has been a revival of interest in this field and in particular, the\nissue of gravitational coupling in the Dirac\u2013Maxwell system has been considered[8]. However,\nthere was the misconception that gravitation was a necessary ingredient for the creation of\nthe soliton.\nIn this paper, we develop the essential results in[5] and[6] and discuss the role of gravitation\nin soliton structure. The experimental inputs are the respective masses of the electron, muon\nand tau, their charge and as a constraint, the upper limit to their size which is \u2243 10\u221216 cm.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: in sec. 2, we set out the essential coupled Dirac\u2013Maxwell\nequations to be solved. The structure of the Dirac wave function in spherical coordinates is\ngiven and particularized to the case of electric field dominance. The equation is separated\nin sec. 3 and we contrast the standard treatment in which a potential function is imposed\nsuch as in the case of hydrogen and the present case of the soliton where the derivation of\nthe potential is part of the problem. The formal structure of the potential in terms of the\nGreen's function is given. It is shown that there do exist spherically symmetric potentials for\nappropriate choices of quantum numbers.\nIn sec. 4, the spherically symmetric energy-momentum tensor is derived. The relationship\nbetween the parameters in the Dirac equation and the physically measured quantities is\ndiscussed and the expression for the spatial spread of the soliton is given. The various\nconstraints including singularity avoidance lead to the required boundary conditions for the\nproblem.\nIn sec. 5, the results are presented. New variables of convenience for numerical integration\nare introduced. The parameters leading to twenty ground state solitons are listed. It is found\nthat there is a critical range which leads to solitons within the experimentally observed upper\nlimit to the size of the electron. Excited states are presented and the mass ratios are found.\nIn the final section 6, the essential achievements as well as the limitations of the results\nare discussed.

That is, simply\n\nZe2\n,\nr\nwhich is the fundamental solution of Laplace's equation[11]\nV (r) = \u2212\n\n\u22072 V = 4\u03c0Ze2 \u03b43 (r)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b43 (r) is a three dimensional Dirac delta function centered at the origin. This is\nconsistent with the far range1 behaviour that we expect to find for the self-field of the fermion\nsince, when we compare (20) with (12) we see that the fermion is treated as an object without\nstructure through the equality,\n\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 = \u2212\u03b43 (r).\nThere is one additional problem that must be explored, namely how to couple relation\n(5) to (17)-(18). This will be achieved in three parts. First, we find the Green's function for\nthe equation (5). Second, we find an analytic form for the probability density \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 using (7).\nOnce this equation is known, we can proceed to the third step which is to find V (r) by\nforming the convolution of the Green's function of step one, with the probability density of\nstep two.\nThe potential V (r) satisfies the Poisson equation (12) and by assuming that the solution\nis sufficiently regular, this can be converted to an integral equation[12]\n2\n\nV (r) = \u22124\u03c0e\n\nZ\n\nG(r, r \u2032 )\u03c8 \u2020 (r \u2032 )\u03c8(r \u2032 ) dr \u2032\n\n(21)\n\nwhere G(r, r \u2032 ) is the Green's function of the Laplacian operator in three dimensions\nG(r, r \u2032 ) = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nl\nl\nX\nX\n1\n1\nr<\n1\n=\n\u2212\nYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6)Ylm\u2217 (\u03b8 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ).\nl+1\n4\u03c0 |r \u2212 r \u2032 |\n2l\n+\n1\nr> m=\u2212l\nl=0\n\n(22)\n\nWith the Green's function determined, we can turn our attention to the probability density.

Table 1 lists the potential (27)\nfor l\u2032 = 0, 1 and illustrates the fact that there exists spherically symmetric states with l\u2032 6= 0.\nA localized solution of this model must satisfy the field equations (17) and (18) for f and\ng and a given energy E where the potential is given by the expression (27).

We\nhave shown that there do exist certain choices of l and m where the probability density is\nspherically symmetric and it is these cases in which our primary interest lies.\nWe can conclude that with the spinor representation given by (7), there are essentially\nthree differential equations to be solved simultaneously. Equations (17)-(18) specify the\nspatial evolution of the wave function and equation (27) reflects the spatial extent of the\nself-field of the particle. A strategy for solving these intrinsically non-linear equations, as\nwell as a few of their interesting properties, will be explored in the following sections.\n\n4\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\nFrom the previous section we have found that the equations to be satisfied for a self-interacting\nfermion are equations (17)-(18) and\n2 2(l\n\n\u0011\n2\n\u2212 j) \u0010 2\n\u2207 V = \u22124\u03c0e\nf + g2 (\u03ba + m + 1) Ylm+1 (\u03b8, \u03c6) + (\u03ba \u2212 m) |Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)|2\n2l + 1\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(28)\n\nwhere we have combined the j = l \u00b1 1/2 cases by using the definition of \u03ba. Since we have\nassumed that the potential V in equations (17)-(18) is spherically symmetric, this necessarily\nrestricts the choice of l and m. Assume from this point on that l and m are chosen to satisfy\nthis criterion. Consequently, equation (28) becomes\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22072 V = \u2212e2 f 2 + g 2 .\n\n(29)\n\nSince the soliton asires as a coupling between Dirac and Maxwell fields, the energy E that\nappears in the Dirac equation is not the total energy of the particle. The total energy can be\nobtained by calculating the T00 component of the energy-momentum tensor. For our field, the\nLagrangian is given by equation (1) where A\u03bc is the vector potential of the electromagnetic\nfield.

This total energy should be associated with\nthe observed mass of the particle as Etot = mc2 . There is still sufficient freedom remaining\nto set limr\u2192\u221e V (r) = 0 because the spinor is invariant under the transformation\nV \u2192 V + \u03b2;\n\nE \u2192E+\u03b2\n\nfor any real-valued \u03b2.\nThe mass m and the charge e that appear in the Dirac equation are not necessarily the\nexperimentally measured quantities just as the charge that appears at a vertex of a Feynman\ngraph is not the experimentally measured charge of the particle. Because of this, we will\nreplace the m in (17)-(18) by the symbol \u03bc. In addition, the e in (29) will be replaced by\nan \u01eb. The symbols m and e will be reserved for the physically observed quantities. With\nthese substitutions, we convert to a set of variables whereby equations (17), (18) and (31)\nare independent of any physical constants. The particular transformation chosen is\nf = \u03b7F, g = \u03b7G, r =\n\nh\u0304x\n, E = \u03bb\u03bcc2 , V = \u03bcc2 U\n\u03bcc\n\nwhere \u03b7 2 = \u03bc3 c4 /\u01eb2 h\u03042 . These redefined variables have the following dimensions in terms of\nlength (L):\n[x] = L0 ; [\u03bb] = L0 ; [F ] = L\u22123/2 ; [G] = L\u22123/2 ; [U ] = L0 .\nThis yields the transformed equations:\ndG 1 + \u03ba\n[\u03bb \u2212 U (x) + 1] F (x) \u2212\n+\nG(x) = 0\ndx\nx\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndF\n1\u2212\u03ba\n[\u03bb \u2212 U (x) \u2212 1] G(x) +\n+\nF (x) = 0\ndx\nx\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0010\n\n\u22072 U + F 2 + G2\n\n\u0011\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\n= 0\n\n(34)\n\nwhere \u22072 is now the Laplacian with respect to the x coordinate.

By substituting \u01eb = e and choosing a value for m, the\nvalue of \u03bc can be determined numerically once the spatial extent of the soliton is known. In\nthis case, the expectation value of the radius of the particle becomes\nZ\n\n\u22072 U x3 dx\n\nZ\n\n\u22072 U x3 dx\nh\u0304c\nh\u0304c\nhri = 2 hxi = 2 2 Z\n= 2 \u0014Z\n\u00152 .\n\u03bcc\n\u03bcc e\n\u03bcc\n2\n2\n\u22072 U x2 dx\n\u2207 U x dx\ne2\n\ne2\n\nTo stay within the current experimental bounds of the mean charge radius, this value must\nbe less than rexp which is \u2264 10\u221218 m in the case of an electron.

Therefore,\n\nU (r) =\n\n\"\n#\n\uf8f1\n2\nN\nr\n1\n3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2212\n2\n\nR0 2\n\uf8f4\nN\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nr\n\n2 R0\n\nfor\nfor\n\nr < R0\n\n(37)\n\nr \u2265 R0 .\n\nWith this representation, one finds that\n\nhri =\n\n9 re me R0\n4 \u03bcN\n\nwhich means that since 0 < hri < rexp , we can conclude that\n0<\n\n4 rexp\nR0\n<\n\u2243 3.088 \u00d7 10\u22124 c2 /MeV\n\u03bcN\n9 re m e\n\nin the case of the electron.\nLet R0 be defined as the effective range of the non-Coulombic behaviour of the potential\nenergy so that for x > R0 , U (x) \u223c N/x. Since U is a solution to a Poisson equation with\n10\n\n\fa negative definite charge density, U (0) must be larger than U (R0 ). This can be quickly\nverified by considering the opposite. If U (0) < U (R0 ) then there exists some r \u2208 (0, R0 ) such\nthat U \u2032 (r) = 0. Therefore integrating (34) from 0 to r, one obtains\nr 2 U \u2032 (r) = 0 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nF 2 + G2 x2 dx\n\nwhich is clearly a contradiction.\nTo determine the initial values of F and G, one simply eliminates either F or G from (3233), say F , which leads to a second order equation for the other, namely,\nG\u2032\u2032 + P G\u2032 + QG = 0\nwhere both P and Q are functions of U , U \u2032 , \u03ba, \u03bb and x. To avoid a singularity in the\npotential U (x), it must be both bounded and have zero slope in a neighbourhood of the\norigin. Moreover, both F and G are bounded in this same neighbourhood. From this, it is\neasy to verify that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u03ba = \u22121\n\uf8f2 0\nF (0) =\narbitrary\n\u03ba = +1\n(38)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0\n\u2200 other \u03ba,\nG(0) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 arbitrary\n\n0\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0\n\n\u03ba = \u22121\n\u03ba = +1\n\u2200 other \u03ba.\n\n(39)\n\nFurthermore, by examining the indicial equation, it can be shown that no fractional powers\nexist in a power series solution of either F or G about the origin x = 0.\nSummarizing the boundary conditions:\nU (x) < U (0) < \u221e,\n\nU \u2032 (0) = 0,\n\nx \u2208 [0, \u221e),\n\ntogether with the conditions (38), (39). For the case \u03ba = \u22121, the initial values of U , G and\nthe energy \u03bb are determined by the requirement that the wave function \u03c8, and hence both\nF and G, vanish exponentially as x \u2192 \u221e.\n\n5\n\nResults\n\nIn the search for numerical solutions\ndifferential equations\ndG\ndx\ndF\ndx\n\u22072 U\n\nit was specified that \u03ba = \u22121 and \u03bb = 1 giving the set of\n= [2 \u2212 U (x)] F (x)\n2\n= \u2212 F (x) + U (x)G(x)\nx\n= \u2212F 2 \u2212 G2 .\n11\n\n\fTo find a soliton, the values of F (0), G(0) are specified and a search is made for the value\nof U (0) whereby limx\u2192\u221e xF (x) = 0 and limx\u2192\u221e xG(x) = 0. Only values of G(0) > 0\nare considered because the equations are symmetric under the transformation G \u2192 \u2212G,\nF \u2192 \u2212F , U \u2192 U . In a neighbourhood of a ground state soliton, the radial probability\ndensity is numerically seen to have a single well-defined minimum value for x > 0. The\nchoice of \u03ba = \u22121 gives the initial condition F (0) = 0.\nThe choice of \u03bb = 1 is simply a numerical convenience. Outside the neighbourhood of\na soliton it is expected that the potential will behave as U (x) \u223c A + B/x for large x. The\nvalue of \u03bb should have been chosen so that the asymptotic behaviour of the potential U (x)\nis purely Coulombic in nature. By defining a shifted potential \u0168 (x) = U (x) \u2212 limx\u2192\u221e U (x),\nthis value of \u03bb must satisfy 1 \u2212 U (x) = \u03bb \u2212 \u0168 (x). Therefore after a soliton is found the value\nof \u03bb is given as \u03bb = 1 \u2212 limx\u2192\u221e U (x). In addition, the starting value of \u0168 (x) is given by\n\u0168 (0) = U (0) + \u03bb \u2212 1.\nUsing the redefined value of \u03bb the observed charge and mass of the particle are compared\nto the values used in the Lagrangian by using the expressions (36) and (35) respectively.

However, depending upon the value of \u03bb, E\ncould be positive, negative or even zero if the electromagnetic and \"bare mass\" terms in the\nenergy exactly cancel. A negative value for E will give an unphysical negative value for the\nobserved\nradius hri. Because of this ambiguity, both the value of hri and the particle width\np\n\u2206r = hr 2 i \u2212 hri2 are presented. Tables 2 and 3 respectively list the numerical parameters\nand the observed properties of a number of ground state particles found where m was taken\nto be the observed mass of the electron me .\nFigure 1 illustrates the radial behaviour of F and G for the case \u01eb = e (i = 1). It is to\nbe noted that for x > 0, F is much larger than G and as a consequence, F G \u226a F 2 + G2 .\nIn fact, G is so small that it resembles a straight line along the x axis. This supports the\nargument that the four-vector potential can be reasonably approximated with only a radial\nA0 component.\n12\n\n\fThe characteristics of a typical soliton with \u01eb 6= e is illustrated with the choice \u01eb/e =\n454.8 (i = 19). In this case the potential plays a much more dominant role in holding the\nparticle together than in the case \u01eb = e. However, since in this case the approximation of\nF G \u226a F 2 + G2 is violated, one would have to solve the full model (equations (9)-(10)) to\nproperly analyse this situation. This would be a far more complicated problem. Figure 2\nillustrates the radial components of this spinor and it shows that the magnitude of G is\nnow comparable to the magnitude of F . Table 3 also shows that the choice of \u01eb = 389.0e,\n\u03bc = 2.360 \u00d7 1012 me (i = 15) yields a soliton with an expectation value for the radius of\n5.05 \u00d7 10\u221223 m. This size is well within the present experimentally determined upper limit\nfor the electron radius of \u2243 10\u221218 m.\nThese equations also exhibit excited states. The nth excited state of our field is characterized through the functions Fn (x), Gn (x) and Un (x) for which the Gn component crosses\nthe abscissa n + 1 times while the Fn component crosses it n times. Once the ground state\nsolution is found, the value of \u03bc can be determined through equation (36). The corresponding\nnth excited state is that excited state with the same observed charge ratio, \u01eb/e, as the ground\nstate. Therefore, in this interpretation of the theory, the ratio of the mass of the nth excited\nstate to the ground state is given by the expression\n1 \u221e dUn 2 2\nx dx\nmn\n\u03bc/m0\n2 0\ndx\n0\n=\n=\n.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\u0010\nZ\n\u0011\nm0\n\u03bc/mn\n1 \u221e dU 2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bb\nF + G x dx +\nx dx\n2 0\ndx\n0\n\u03bbn\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nFn2 + G2n x2 dx +\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nFigure 3 shows radial probability density of the first three states for the case G(0) = 1. Each\nof these solitons has a different value of \u01eb/e.\nFigure 4 illustrates the behaviour of the mass ratio, \u03bc/m, as a function of the charge ratio\n\u01eb/e for the ground state and the first two excited states. For each class of particles there is\na charge ratio where the electromagnetic and bare mass components of the energy balance\nmaking E = 0. At this value of \u01eb/e, the mass ratio \u03bc/m \u2192 \u221e. At charge ratios less than\nthis critical value the mass ratio is negative whereas charge ratios above this critical value\nresult in a positive value of \u03bc/m. There is numerical evidence that each class of particles\nhas an upper bound for the charge ratio. Above this maximum charge ratio we were unable\nto find any solutions such that limx\u2192\u221e xF (x) \u2192 0 or limx\u2192\u221e xG(x) \u2192 0. This necessarily\nrestricts the definition of the mass ratio defined above. Figure 4 also illustrates the fact that\nat moderate charge ratios, the electromagnetic field does not contain an appreciable amount\nof the particle energy resulting in the behaviour |\u03bc/m| \u2243 \u01eb/e.\nThe mass ratios of the first and second excited states with respect to the ground state\nsolutions are shown in figure 5. This ratio is only defined up to a maximum value of \u01eb/e since\nbeyond \u01eb/e \u2243 550, a ground state fails to exist. For excited states, this maximum admissible\ncharge ratio increases. This implies that for a fixed value of \u01eb/e there may not exist a ground\nstate solution, but there will be arbitrarily many excited states. As is readily apparent from\n13\n\n\ffigure 5, the only appreciable mass splitting occurs for large charge ratios. However, it is\nprecisely for large charge ratios where our approximation that F G \u226a F 2 + G2 breaks down.\n\n6\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have seen that spherically symmetric Dirac-Maxwell solitons can be constructed and with\na charge and mass to model the electron successfully. However, it should be noted that the\nhigher energy excited states of this form did not yield the large mass separations of the muon\nand tau relative to the electron in this model. The search thus far has been restricted to\nspherical solitons. It is conceivable that a relaxation of this restriction or some other change\nin conditions would increase the mass splitting. In any event, we have shown that DiracMaxwell solitons exist and are capable of modelling an electron where the charge-to-mass\nratio is the observed \u2243 1021 in units in which G = c = 1. Furthermore, we have found a\ncharge-to-mass ratio that simultaneously yields the observed charge and mass of the electron\nas well as exhibiting a degreee of compactification that is well within the current experimental\nupper limit. Finster et al.[8] have considered Einstein\u2013Dirac\u2013Maxwell (EDM) solitons and\nconcluded that it is the interaction with gravitation which is responsible for the existence\nof bound states. However, we see here that bound states exist with negligible gravitational\ninteraction. While the e/m ratio at which significant gravitational coupling sets in is yet to\nbe determined for EDM solitons, it is our conjecture that this will be so at the same level that\nwas found earlier in the case of minimally coupled scalar interaction[4], namely for e/m \u2243 1.\nThe known fundamental charged particles of nature, on the other hand have enormous e/m\nratios.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Einstein, A. & Rosen, N.

For moderate charge ratios, the value of mn /m0 \u2243 1\nwith the mass ratio of the excited state n = 2 slightly larger than for the n = 1 state. Beyond the point\nwhere the ground state mass ratio becomes unbounded, the mass ratios begin to split. In this region,\nthe |m1 /m0 | ratio exceeds the |m2 /m0 | ratio. In this region the approximation F G \u226a F 2 + G2 is no\nlonger valid.\n\n25\n\n\f"}
