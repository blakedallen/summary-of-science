We shall discuss two\ndistinct modifications of the vacuum: restoration of chiral symmetry due to\nquantum fluctuations of the chiral field, as heralded by Kleinert and Van\nden Boosche [1], and a vacuum instability not related to chiral symmetry\nrestoration [2].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nChiral symmetry restoration due to quantum fluctuations of the chiral field.\nThe linear sigma model argument.\n\nThe physical vacuum with a spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is often\ndescribed by the linear sigma model, which, in the chiral limit (m\u03c0 = 0), has\na euclidean action of the form:\n!\nZ\n\u00112\n1\n\u03ba2 \u0010 2\n1\n2\n2\n\u03c3 + \u03c0i2 \u2212 f\u03c02\n(1)\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c3) + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0i ) +\nI = d4 x\n2\n2\n8\nClassically, we have (for translationally invariant fields):\n\u03c3 2 + \u03c0i2 = f\u03c02\n\n(2)\n\nand the vacuum stationary point is:\n\u03c3 = f\u03c0\n\n\u03c0i = 0\n\n(3)\n\nWe assume that \u03ba2 is large enough (and the \u03c3-meson is heavy enough)\nnot to have to worry about the quantum fluctuations of the \u03c3 field. So we\nquantize the pion field while the \u03c3 field remains classical. We may then say\nthat: \u03c3 2 = f\u03c02 \u2212 h\u03c0i2 i. Classically, h\u03c0i2 i = 0 but the quantum fluctuations of\nthe pion field make h\u03c0i2 i > 0 and therefore \u03c3 2 < f\u03c02 .\nLet us estimate the fluctuation h\u03c0i2 i of the pion field. A system of free\npions of mass m\u03c0 is described by the partition function:\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n\u2212 12\n\nD (\u03c0) e\n\nR\n\n2 +m2 \u03c0\nd4 x\u03c0i (\u2212\u2202\u03bc\n\u03c0) i\n\n= e\u2212 2 tr ln(\u2212\u2202\u03bc +m\u03c0 )\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nIt follows that:\nZ\nD\nE\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011X\n\u2202 ln Z\n\u2202 1\n1 \u0010 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\nd4 x \u03c0i2 (x) = \u2212\n=\ntr\nln\n\u2212\u2202\n+\nm\n=\n\u03a9\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03c0\nf\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2202m\u03c0\n\u2202m\u03c0 2\n2\nk + m2\u03c0\nk<\u039b\n(5)\n2\n\n\fwhere\nthe sum is regularized using a 4-momentum cut-off and where \u03a9 =\nR\nd4 x.is the euclidean space-time volume. In the chiral limit m\u03c0 = 0, we\nhave:\nD\nE\n\u0011X 1\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u039b2\n1 \u0010 2\n2\n\u03c0i2 (x) =\nNf \u2212 1\n=\nN\n\u2212\n1\n(6)\nf\n2\n2\u03a9\n16\u03c0 2\nk<\u039b k\nso that:\n\n\u039b2\n(7)\n16\u03c0 2\nIf we had evaluated\nwith a 3-momentum cut-off, we would have\n\u0010 this quantity\n\u0011 2\n\u039b\nobtained h\u03c0i2 i = Nf2 \u2212 1 8\u03c0\n.\nLet\nus pursue with a 4-momentum cut-off.\n2\nWe have:\n\u0011 \u039b2\nh\u03c0i2 i \u0010 2\n=\nN\n\u2212\n1\n(8)\nf\nf\u03c02\n16\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\n\u0010\n\n\u03c3 2 = f\u03c02 \u2212 Nf2 \u2212 1\n\n\u0011\n\nWe deduce that chiral symmetry restoration will occur when \u03c3 = 0, that is,\nh\u03c0 2 i\nwhen f i2 > 1:\n\u03c0\n\u0011 \u039b2\nh\u03c0i2 i \u0010 2\n=\nN\n\u2212\n1\n>1\n(9)\nf\nf\u03c02\n16\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\nWith f\u03c0 = 93 MeV and with Nf2 \u2212 1 = 3 pions, the condition reads:\n\u039b2 >\n\n1\n2.20 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n\u039b > 674 MeV\n\n(10)\n\nIn most calculations which use the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, this condition is fulfilled. We conclude that the quantum fluctuations of the pion do\nindeed restore chiral symmetry. If we had used a 3-momentum cut-off, chiral\nsymmetry would be restored when \u039b > 477 MeV .\n\n2.2\n\nThe non-linear sigma model argument.\n\nWe now argue that this is precisely what is claimed by Kleinert and Van den\nBoosche [1], although it is said in a considerably different language. They\nargue as follows. If \u03ba2 (and therefore the \u03c3 mass) is large enough, the action\ncan be thought of as the action of the non-linear sigma model, which in turn\ncan be viewed as an action with Nf2 fields, namely (\u03c3, \u03c0i ), subject to the\nconstraint:\n\u03c3 2 + \u03c0i2 = f\u03c02\n(11)\n\n3\n\n\fThe way to treat the non-linear sigma model is in the textbooks [3]. We\nwork with the action:\nI\u03bb (\u03c3, \u03c0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\nd4 x\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c3)2 + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0i )2 + \u03bb \u03c3 2 + \u03c0i2 \u2212 f\u03c02\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(12)\n\nin which we add a constraining parameter \u03bb. The action is made stationary\nwith respect to variations of \u03bb. We integrate out the \u03c0 field, to get the\neffective action:\nI\u03bb (\u03c3) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c3)2 + \u03bb \u03c3 2 \u2212 f\u03c02 + tr ln \u2212\u2202\u03bc2 + \u03bb\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\n(13)\n\nThe action is stationary with respect to variations of \u03bb and \u03c3 if:\n\u03bb\u03c3 = 0\n\n\u03c3 2 = f\u03c02 \u2212\n\n\u0011X\n1\n1\u0010 2\nNf \u2212 1\n2\n2\nk k +\u03bb\n\n(14)\n\nSo either \u03bb = 0 and \u03c3 6= 0, in which case we have:\n\u03c3 2 = f\u03c02 \u2212\n\n\u0011X 1\n1\u0010 2\nNf \u2212 1\n2\n2\nk k\n\n(15)\n\nor \u03bb 6= 0 and \u03c3 = 0.\nThe condition (15) is exactly the same as the condition (7). Thus, the\nh\u03c02 i\n\"stifness factor\", discussed in Ref.[1], is nothing but a measure of f i2 .\n\u03c0\n\n3\n\nQuantum fluctuations of the quark condensate calculated in the Nambu Jona-Lasinio\nmodel.\n\nWe now show that the quantum fluctuations of the chiral field are indeed\nlarge in the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, but that chiral symmetry is far\nfrom being restored. The regularized Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is defined\nin section 4. We begin by giving some results.\nIn the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, the chiral field is composed of a scalar\nfield S and Nf2 \u2212 1 pseudoscalar fields Pi . They are related to the quark\nbilinears:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nS = V \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\nPi = V \u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4i \u03c8\n(16)\n4\n\n\f2\n\nwhere V = \u2212 Ng c is the 4-quark interaction strength. The quark propagator\nin the vacuum is:\n1\n(17)\nk\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc + M0 rk2\nand the model is regularized using either a sharp 4-momentum cut-off or a\nsoft gaussian cut-off function:\nrk = 1 if k 2 < \u039b2 rk = 0 if k > \u039b (sharp cut \u2212 of f )\n2\n\u2212 k2\n2\u039b\n\nrk = e\n\n(gaussian regulator)\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n.

The quark condensate is\nexpressed in units of \u039b3 .\n\n3.2\n\nThe effect and meaning of the exchange terms.\n\nThe tables 1 and 2 show that, among the 1/Nc corrections, the exchange\nterms dominate. The exchange and ring graphs are illustrated on figures 1\nand 2. The way in which they arise is explained in section 4.1. The exchange\ngraphs contribute 2-3 times more than the remaining ring graphs. Furthermore, the pion contributes about three times more to the condensate than\nthe sigma, so that the sigma field contributes about as much to the exchange\nterm as any one of the pions. However, the exchange term in the pion channel enhances the quark condensate instead of reducing it. As a result of this\nthere is a very strong cancellation between the exchange terms and the ring\ngraphs. This is why the sigma and pion loops contribute so little to the quark\ncondensate. They increase the condensate by 4% when a sharp cut-off is used,\nand by 1% when a gaussian regulator is used. This is about ten times less\nthan 1/Nc .\nThe ring graphs reduce the condensate (in absolute value) in both the\nsigma and pion channels. This can be expected. Indeed, the ring graphs\n7\n\n\fpromote quarks from the Dirac sea negative energy orbits (which contribute\nnegative values to the condensate) to the positive energy orbits (which contribute positive values to the condensate). The net result is a positive contribution to the condensate which reduces the negative classical value.\nWhat then is the meaning of the exchange terms? The exchange terms\nhave the special feature of belonging to first order perturbation theory (see\nfigures 1 and 2). Their contribution to the energy is not due to a modification\nof the Dirac sea. It is simply the exchange term arising in the expectation\nvalue of the quark-quark interaction in the Dirac sea.\nHowever, the contribution of the exchange term to the quark condensate\ndoes involve q q\u0304 excitations. These excitations are due to a modification of\nthe constituent quark mass which is expressed in terms of quark-antiquark\nexcitations of the Dirac sea. The exchange term is modifying (increasing in\nfact) the constituent quark mass and therefore the value of f\u03c0 .\nThese results suggest that, in order to reduce the Nambu Jona-Lasinio\nmodel to an equivalent sigma model, it might be better to include the exchange term in the constituent quark mass, which is another way of saying\nthat, in spite of the 1/Nc counting rule, it may be better to do Hartree-Fock\ntheory than Hartree theory. The exchange (Fock) term should be included\nin the gap equation. The direct (Hartree) term is, of course, included in the\nclassical bosonized action.\nIn the equivalent sigma model, f\u03c0 is proportional to the constituent quark\nmass. Failure to notice that that the constituent quark mass is altered by\nthe exchange term is what lead Kleinert and Van den Boosche to conclude\nerronously in Ref.[1] that chiral symmetry would be restored in the Nambu\nJona-Lasinio model. They were right however in expecting large quantum\nfluctuations of the quark condensate.\n\n4\n\nThe regularized Nambu Jona-Lasinio model.\n\nThe condensates quoted in section 3.1 were calculated with a regularized\nNambu Jona-Lasinio model which is defined by the euclidean action:\n\nIm (q, q\u0304) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\ng2\nd4 x q\u0304 (\u2212i\u2202\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc ) q + m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 \u2212\n+ j \u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n2Nc\n\"\n\n!\n\n8\n\n#\n\n(29)\n\n\fThe euclidean Dirac matrices are \u03b3\u03bc = \u03b3 \u03bc = (i\u03b2, ~\u03b3 ). The matrices \u0393a =\n(1, i\u03b35~\u03c4 ) are defined in terms of the Nf2 \u2212 1 generators ~\u03c4 of flavor rotations.\n2\nResults are given for Nf = 2 flavors. The coupling constant Ng c is taken to\nbe inversely proportional to Nc in order to reproduce the Nc counting rules.\nThe current quark mass m is introduced\nD\nE as a source term used to calculate\nthe regularized quark condensate \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 . We have also introduced a source\n\u0010\n\nterm 12 j \u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\u001c\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\n\u00112 \u001d\n\n.\n\n\u00112\n\nwhich is used to calculate the squared quark condensate\n\nThe quark field is q (x) and the \u03c8 (x) fields are delocalized quark fields,\nwhich are defined in terms of a regulator r as follows:\n\u03c8 (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x hx |r| yi q (y)\n\n(30)\n\nThe regulator r is diagonal in k-space: hk |r| k \u2032 i = \u03b4kk\u2032 r (k) and its explicit\nform in given in Eq.(18). The use of a sharp cut-off function is tantamount\nto the calculation of Feynman graphs in which the quark propagators are\ncut off at a 4-momentum \u039b - a most usual practise. The regulator r, introduced by the delocalized fields, makes all the Feynman graphs converge. A\nregularization of this type results when quarks propagate in a vacuum described by in the instanton liquid model of the QCD (see Ref.[4] and further\nreferences therein). A Nambu Jona-Lasinio model regulated in this manner\nwith a gaussian regulator was first used in Ref.[5], and further elaborated\nand applied in both the meson and the soliton sectors [5],[6],[7],[8], [9],[2]. Its\nproperties are also discussed in [10].\nWith one exception. In this work, as in Ref.[2], the regulator multiplies the\ncurrent quark mass. The introduction of the regulator in the current quark\nmass term m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = mq\u0304r 2 q requires some explanation. The current quark\nD\nE\nmass m is used as a source term to calculate the quark condensate \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\nwhich, admittedly, would be finite (by reason of symmetry) even in the absence of a regulator - and, indeed, values of quark condensates are usually\ncalculated with an unregularized source term in the Nambu\nJona-Lasinio\nac\u001c\n\u001d\ntion. However, when we calculate the fluctuation\nthe quark condensate, the expectation value\n\n\u001c\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\n\u00112 \u001d\n\nbe inconsistent and difficult to interpret the fluctuation\n9\n\n\u00112\n\nD\n\n\u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n\nE2\n\nof\n\ndiverges. It would\n\n\u001c\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\n\u00112 \u001d\n\nD\n\n\u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n\nE2\n\n\fD\n\nE\n\nif \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 were evaluated using a bare source term and\n\n\u001c\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u0393a \u03c8\n\n\u00112 \u001d\n\nusing a\n\nregulator. When a regularized source term m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = mq\u0304r 2 q is used, the current quark mass m can no longer be identified with the current quark mass\nterm appearing in the QCD lagrangian. Of course, when a sharp cut-off\nis used, it makes no difference if the current quark mass term is multiplied\nby the regulator or not. We have seen in section 3.1 that the leading order\nD\n\nE1/3\n\ncontribution to the quark condensate \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\ndiminishes by only 20% when\nthe sharp cut-off is replaced by a gaussian regulator. (This statement may\nbe misleading because when the sharp cut-off is replaced by a gaussian regulator, the interaction strength V is also modified so as to fit f\u03c0 . If we use a\ngaussian regulator,\nD\nE the quark condensate calculated with a regulated source\n2\nterm mr is \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = \u22120.0218 \u039b3 whereas the quark condensate calculated\nD\n\nE\n\nwith a bare source term m is \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = \u22120.0505 \u039b3 .)\nThe way in which the current quark mass of the QCD lagrangian appears\nin the low energy effective theory is model dependent and it has been studied\nin some detail in Ref.[11] within the instanton liquid model of the QCD\nvacuum [12],[13],[4].\nAn equivalent bosonized form of the Nambu Jona-Lasinio action (29) is:\n\n1\n(\u03c6 \u2212 m) (V \u2212 j)\u22121 (\u03c6 \u2212 m) (31)\n2\nThe first term is the quark loop expressed in terms of the chiral field \u03c6, which\nis a chiral 4-vector \u03c6a = (S, Pi ) so that \u03c6a \u0393a = S + i\u03b35 \u03c4i Pi .

The contributions are expressed in units of\n\u039b4 .\nwell. The vacuum constituent quark mass is the mass M0 obtained with\nj = 0. The contribution of each Feynman graph to the effective potential is\nstationary at the point M = M0 and this is why plots of the the effective\npotential against M are nicer to look at than plots against j. The vacuum\nconstituent quark mass M0 is a measure of the interaction strength V , to\nwhich it is related by the gap equation. For a given shape of the regulator, the\noccurrence of an instability depends on only one parameter, namely M0 /\u039b.\nFigure 3 shows the effective potential calculated with a gaussian cut-off\nfor various values of M0 /\u039b. The ground state appears to be stable within the\nrange of reasonable values of M0 /\u039b.\nFigure 4 shows the effective potential plotted against M when a sharp\ncut-off is used.

It is expressed in units of \u039b4 .\nwith respect to increasing values of M. This instability is not related to the\nrestoration of chiral symmetry and, indeed, the pion remains a Goldstone\nboson for all values of M. As shown on Fig.5, the instability is due to the\nclassical action and the meson loop contributions do not modify it.\nFigure 6 shows the effective potential calculated with a sharp 3-momentum\ncut-off. No instability appears. This provides a clue as to the cause of the\ninstability which arises when a sharp 4-momentum cut-off is used. Indeed,\nwhen a 3-momentum cut-off is used, the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model defines a\ntime-independent hamiltonian and the 3-momentum cut-off simply restricts\nthe Hilbert space available to the quarks. This allows a quantum mechanical\ninterpretation of the results. If H is the Nambu Jona-Lasinio hamiltonian,\n17\n\n\finverse propagators KP\u22121 (q = 0) Z\u03c0 =\nregulated action\nregulated f (q)\nf (q) = f (0)\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u22121\ndKP\ndq 2\n\nq=0\n\n0.0995\n0.0850\n0.0850\n\nKS\u22121 (q = 0)\n0.0546\n0.0544\n0.0544\n\ndKS\u22121\ndq 2\n\nq=0\n\n0.0592\n0.0448\n0.0850\n\nTable 3: Three approximations to the inverse S and P propagators, calculated with a sharp 4-momentum cut-off and with M0 /\u039b = 0.4. The first row\ngives the values obtained from an regularized action (31). The second row\ngives the values obtained from a unregularized action and by subsequently\nregularizing the loop integrals. The last row gives the results obtained by\nneglecting the q dependence of the loop integral f (q).

The effective potential \u0393 is then\nequal to the energy E (j) = hj |H| ji of the system and it displays a stationary\npoint when j = 0 or, equivalently, when M = M0 . The Nambu Jona-Lasinio\nmodel, regularized with a 3-momentum cut-off, has been used in Refs.[14]\nand [15] for example.\nThe use of a 3-momentum cut-off has another important feature. The\nmeson propagators have only poles on the imaginary axis where they should.\nWhen a 4-momentum cut-off is used, unphysical poles appear in the complex\nenergy plane, as they do when proper-time regularization is used for the quark\nloop [16].\nThe fact that the instability occurs when the model is regularized with a\n4-momentum cut-off and not when a 3-momentum cut-off is used, strongly\nsuggests that the instability is due to the unphysical poles introduced by the\nregulator. This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that the instability also occurs when a gaussian cut-off is used, but at the much higher\nvalues M0 /\u039b \u2265 2.93 where the cut-off is too small to be physically meaningful. With a gaussian regulator and in the relevant range of parameters\n0.4 < M0 /\u039b < 0.8, one needs to probe the system with values as high as\nM/\u039b > 4 before it becomes apparent that the energy is not bounded from\nbelow. The instability is an unpleasant feature of effective theories which use\n18\n\n\frelatively low cut-offs. However, the low value of the cut-off is dictated by\nthe vacuum properties and we need to learn to work with it. Further details\nare found in Ref.[2].\nWe conclude from this analysis that it is much safer to use a soft regulator,\nsuch as a gaussian, than a sharp cut-off.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Kleinert and B.
