They play today a major role in the understanding of several properties\nof High Energy Physics, ranging from phenomenological aspects of the Standard Model\nof Electroweak Interactions to mathematical consistency of Superstring theories [1].\nFrom a mathematical point of view, supersymmetry is related to a grading of the\ngroup of space-time symmetries of the theory and as such, the concept of supersymmetry\ncan be extended to other groups beyond Poincar\u00e9.\nThe case where the space-time group is the Galilean Group is particularly relevant\nas many condensed matter systems display explicitly this symmetry. The 3 + 1 dimensional case was first considered in Ref.[2]. In Ref.[3], the supersymmetric extension of the\nGalilean group in 2 + 1 dimension was discussed and a field theoretical model possessing\nthis symmetry was explicitly built. The model is interesting as it incorporates gauge\nfields. The dynamics of these gauge fields is dictated by a Chern-Simons, which due to\nits topological character has a larger symmetry than the usual Maxwell action governing\nelectromganetism. It is also possible to write for the bosonic sector of the model self-dual\nor Bogolnyi-Prassad-Sommerfeld (BPS) equations [4], indicating that the relation between\nBPS equations and supersymmetry, characteristic of relativistic theories [5], also extends\nto the nonrelativistic domain. Galilean supersymmetry in 2 + 1 was further studied in [6].\nNotice that in the models considered in Refs.[3], [6], [7], the invariance group is indeed\nenlarged by the presence of dilatation and conformal symmetries leading to the study of\nSchroedinger super-algebras.\nAnother area where Galilean symmetry can be relevant is that concerned with the\nstudy of perfect fluids. Also in this case fermionic degrees of freedom cam be incorporated\nin the theory and supersymetric models in 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 dimensions can be built [8],\n[9], [10].\nVery recently, a Galilean model in 1 + 1 dimension was considered in Refs.[11], [12]\nin the context of ultracold boson-fermion mixture in one dimensional optical lattices.\nThis is indeed a very interesting proposal since according to these authors it is possible\nto tune experimentally the parameters of the model in such a way that the effective\nHamiltonian describing the dynamics of the vortex is indeed a 1 + 1 dimensional Galilean\nsupersymmetric theory.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this note we will study in more detail the structure of the supersymmetry behind\nthe model presented in [11], [12]. In particular, we will find the supersymmetry transformations that leave the action invariant. A basic feature of supersymmetric theories is that\nthe full Hamiltonian can be written as an anticommutator of supersymmetry generators.\nWe will show that the charges generating these transformations in this nonrelativistic\nmodel also satisty this basic property (in [12] it was shown that the anticommutator of\nthe charges equals only the free Hamiltonian).\nIn order to study the supersymmetric structure of the theory, we will make use of\na relation of the 1 + 1 model presented in [11],[12] with the 2 + 1 model studied in [3].\nThis connection, which was already known for the bosonic sector of the theory [13], is\nnot necessary for establishing the main result of this note (the correct supersymmetry\nalgebra), but in our opinion, the existence of such a connection makes the model even\nmore interesting. On the other hand, it will lead us in a natural way to the discussion of\nthe relation between supersymmetry and self-dual equations.\nLet us then start by considering the 2 + 1 dimensional Chern-Simons model coupled to\nnonrelativistic bosonic(\u03c6) and fermionic (down-spinor \u03c8) matter governed by the action,\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n3\n(Di \u03c6)\u2020 Di \u03c6 \u2212\n(Di \u03c8)\u2020 Di \u03c8\nS = Scs + d x i\u03c6\u2020 Dt \u03c6 + i\u03c8 \u2020 Dt \u03c8 \u2212\n2m\n2m\n\u0011\ne \u2020\n\u03c8 F12 \u03c8 + \u03bb1 (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) + \u03bb2 (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8)\n\u2212\n2m\n(1)\nwhere the Chern-Simons action is given by,\nZ\nZ\n\u03ba\n3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\nScs =\nd x\u01eb A\u03bc F\u03bd\u03bb = \u03ba d3 x (A0 F12 + A2 \u2202t A1 )\n4\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ,\n\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe metric tensor is g\u03bc\u03bd = (1, \u22121, \u22121) and \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb is the totally antisymmetric tensor such\n\nthat \u01eb012 = 1. We are choosing units such that ~ = 1. We are including a Pauli term for\nthe fermion corresponding to a down-spinor.\nThe bosonic sector of the model (\u03c8 = 0) model was first considered in Refs. [14], [4].\n\nIt is an explicit example of a gauge theory possessing Galilean invariance and it provides\n\n3\n\n\fa field theoretical formulation of the Aharonov Bohm problem. Notice that there is no\nmassless particle associated to the vector field. For the particular relation of coupling\nconstants\n\u03bb1 =\n\ne2\n2m\u03ba\n\n(4)\n\nthe model has self-dual equations and many of the properties of its soliton solutions can\nbe established in detail [4]. The fermionic generalization of this model has been analyzed\nin [3] where it was shown that for a particular choice of coupling constants\n\u03bb1 =\n\ne2\n,\n2m\u03ba\n\n\u03bb2 = 3\u03bb1\n\n(5)\n\nit exhibits an extended Galilean symmetry. Thus, the usual connection between the existence of BPS equations and extended supersymmetry [5] also holds in this nonrelativistic\nexample.\nIn Ref.[13] a reduction of the purely bosonic model to 1 + 1 dimensions was considered\nby assuming that the fields do not depend on one of the spatial coordinates, say x2 . One\nof the main purposes in that work was to explore if the peculiar static properties of the\nparent 2 + 1 dimensional model were inherited by the 1 + 1 reduction.

If we consider the Yang-Lai model as a gauge \"BF\" theory, then\nthe SUSY transformations are local in space-time. If we instead eliminate the gauge fields\nA0 and A1 together with the scalar field B, then the Hamiltonian of the theory becomes\nsimpler, but the supersymmetry charges become more complicated nonlocal functions of\nthe physical fields.\nThe introduction of chemical potentials can be achieved by considering an effective\npotential\n\u03a9 = H \u2212 \u03bcb Nb \u2212 \u03bcf Nf .\n\n(39)\n\nThen, as far as \u03bcb = \u03bcf , the transformations generated by Q1 and Q2 are still formally a\nsymmetry {Qi , \u03a9} = 0\nAs discussed by [16] the B field plays also an important role in the derivation of the\nself-dual equations.

Solitons solutions\nto this equations can be found when \u03bb1 \u2265 0, i.e, attractive self-interactions, and they have\nbeen considered in detail in [13], [16]\nWe have thus discussed how a simple nonrelativistic supersymmetric model in 1 + 1\ndimensions is related to a model of matter interacting with gauge fields whose dynamics\nis governed by a \"BF\" term. Although the gauge fields can be eliminated in terms of the\nmatter fields, their presence helps in identifying the correct supersymmetry transformations which in this case became a nonlocal functional of the matter fields.\nDue to the low dimensionality, the model here discussed might provide the simplest theoretical realization of Galilean Supersymmetry, and according to the authors\nof Ref.[11],[12], the model could be accessible experimentally. From the theoretical point\nof view, it can also provide an interesting playground where to explore further the relation\nbetween BPS states, supersymmetry and integrability.\n\nG.S.Lozano thanks D.Jezek for interesting discussion on Bose condensates and R.Jackiw\nfor pointing out the existence of Galilean supersymmetry in fluids.
