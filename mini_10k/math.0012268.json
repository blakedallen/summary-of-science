Litvinov, V. P. Maslov and G. B. Shpiz\nIn this paper, we present an algebraic approach to idempotent functional\nanalysis, which is an abstract version of idempotent analysis in the sense\nof [1\u20133]. Elements of such an approach were used, for example, in [1, 4].\nThe basic concepts and results are expressed in purely algebraic terms. We\nconsider idempotent versions of certain basic results of linear functional analysis, including the theorem on the general form of a linear functional and the\nHahn\u2013Banach and Riesz\u2013Fischer theorems.\n1. Recall that an additive semigroup S with commutative addition \u2295\nis called an idempotent semigroup (IS) if the relation x \u2295 x = x is fulfilled\nfor all elements x \u2208 S. If S contains a neutral element, this element is\ndenoted by the symbol 0. Any IS is a partially ordered set with respect\nto the following standard order: x \u0016 y if and only if x \u2295 y = y. It is\nobvious that this order is well defined and x \u2295 y = sup{x, y}. Thus, any IS\nis an upper semilattice; moreover, the concepts of IS and upper semilattice\ncoincide [5]. An idempotent semigroup S is called a-complete (or algebraically\ncomplete) if it is complete as an ordered set, i.e., if any subset X in S has\nthe least upper bound sup(X) denoted by \u2295X and the greatest lower bound\ninf(X) denoted by \u2227X. This semigroup is called b-complete (or boundedly\ncomplete), if any bounded above subset X of this semigroup (including the\nempty subset) has the least upper bound \u2295X (in this case, any nonempty\nsubset Y in S has the greatest lower bound \u2227Y and S in a lattice). Note\nthat any a-complete or b-complete IS has the zero element 0 that coincides\nwith \u2295\u00d8, where \u00d8 is the empty set. Certainly, a-completeness implies the bcompleteness. Completion by means of cuts [5] yields an embedding S \u2192 Sb of\nan arbitrary IS S into an a-complete IS Sb (which is called a normal completion\n1\n\nInternational Sophus Lie Centre, Moscow, Russia, e-mail:islc@islc.msk.su\n\n1\n\n\fb\n\nof S); in addition, Sb = S. The b-completion procedure S \u2192 Sbb is defined\nsimilarly: if S \u220b \u221e = sup S, then Sbb = S; otherwise, Sb = Sbb \u222a {\u221e}.\nAn arbitrary b-complete IS S also may differ from Sb only by the element\n\u221e = sup S.\nLet S and T be b-complete IS. Then, a homomorphism f : S \u2192 T is\nsaid to be a b-homomorphism if f (\u2295X) = \u2295f (X) for any bounded subset X\nin S. If the b-homomorphism f is extended to a homomorphism Sb \u2192 Tb of\nthe correesponding normal completions and f (\u2295X) = \u2295f (X) for all X \u2282 S,\nthen f is said to be an a-homomrphism. An IS S equipped with a topology\nsuch that the set {s \u2208 S|s \u0016 b} is closed in this topology for any b \u2208 S is\ncalled a topological idempotent semigroup S.\nProposition 1. Let S be an a-complete topological IS and T be a bcomplete topological IS such that, for any nonempty subsemigroup X in T ,\nthe element \u2295X is contained in the topological closure of X in T . Then, a\nhomomorphism f : T \u2192 S that maps zero into zero is an a-homomorphism\nif and only if the mapping f is lower semicontinuous in the sense that the\nset {t \u2208 T |f (t) \u0016 s} is closed in T for any s \u2208 S.\n2. An idempotent semigroup K on which an associative multiplication \u2299\nwith identity 1 is defined together with the idempotent addition \u2295 and both\ndistributive relations are fulfilled is called an idempotent semiring (ISR). The\nelement 0 \u2208 K, 0 6= 1 is called a zero of the semiring K if x \u2295 0 = x and\nx \u2299 0 = 0 \u2299 x = 0 for any x \u2208 K. A commutative ISR in which every\nnonzero element is invertible with respect to the multiplication is called an\nidempotent semifield (or briefly, semifield). An idempotent semiring K is\ncalled a-complete (respectively b-complete) if K is an a-complete (respectively\nb-complete) IS and, for any subset (respectively, for any bounded subset) X\nin K and any k \u2208 K, the generalized distributive laws k \u2299 (\u2295X) = \u2295(k \u2299 X)\nand (\u2295X) \u2299 k = \u2295(X \u2299 k) are fulfilled. Generalized distributivity implies\nthat any a-complete or b-complete ISR has a zero element that coincides with\n\u2295\u00d8, where \u00d8 is the empty set. The concept of a-complete ISR coincides with\nthe concept of complete dioid in the sense of [4].\nThe set R(max, +) of real numbers equipped with the idempotent addition \u2295 = max and multiplication \u2299 = + is an example of an ISR; in this\ncase, 1 = 0. Adding the element 0 = \u2212\u221e to this ISR, we obtain a b-complete\nsemiring Rmax = R \u222a {\u2212\u221e} with the same operations and the same zero.\nAdding the element = \u221e to Rmax and asumming that 0 \u2299 (+\u221e) = 0 and\n\n2\n\n\fx \u2299 (+\u221e) = +\u221e for x 6= 0 and x \u2295 (+\u221e) = +\u221e for any x, we obtain the\na-complete ISR c\nRmax = Rmax \u222a {+\u221e}. The standard order on R(max, +),\nc\nRmax and Rmax coincides with the ordinary order. The ISRs R(max, +) and\nRmax are semifields. On the contrary, an a-complete ISR that does not coincide with {0, 1} cannot be a semifield. An important class of examples is\nrelated to (topological) vector lattices (see, for example, [5]; [6, Chapter 5]).\nDefining the sum x \u2295 y as sup{x, y} and the multiplication \u2299 as the addition of vectors, we can interpret the vector lattices as idempotent semifields.\nAdding the element 0 to a complete vector lattice (in the sense of [5,6]), we\nobtain a b-complete semifield. If, in addition, we add the infinite element,\nwe obtain an a-complete ISR (which, as an ordered set, coincides with the\nnormal completion of the original lattice).\n3. Let V be an idempotent semigroup and K be an idempotent semiring.\nSuppose that a multiplication k, x 7\u2192 k \u2299 x of all elements from K by the\nelements from V is defined; moreover, this multiplication is associative and\ndistributive with respect to the addition in V and 1 \u2299 x = x, 0 \u2299 x = 0 for\nall x \u2208 V . In this case, the semigroup V is called an idempotent semimodule\n(or simply, a semimodule) over K. The element 0V \u2208 V is called the zero\nof the semimodule V if k \u2299 0V = 0V and 0V \u2295 x = x for any k \u2208 K and\nx \u2208 V . Let V be a semimodule over a b-complete idempotent semiring K.\nThis semimodule is called b-complete if it is b-complete as an IS and, for\nany bounded subsets Q in K and X in V , the generalized distributive laws\n(\u2295Q) \u2299 x = \u2295(Q \u2299 x) and k \u2299 (\u2295X) = \u2295(k \u2299 X) are fulfilled for all k \u2208 K\nand x \u2208 X. This semimodule is called a-complete if it is b-complete and\ncontains the element \u221e = sup V .\nA semimodule V over a b-complete semifield K is said to be an a-idempotent\na-space (b-space) if this semimodule is a-complete (respectively, b-complete)\nand the equality (\u2227Q) \u2299 x = \u2227(Q \u2299 x) holds for any nonempty subset Q in\nK and any x \u2208 V , x 6= \u221e = sup V . The normal completion Vb of a b-space\n(as an IS) has the structure of an idempotent a-space (and may differ from\nV only by the element \u221e = sup V ).\nLet V and W be idempotent semimodules over an idempotent semiring\nK. A mapping p : V \u2192 W is said to be linear (over K) if\np(x \u2295 y) = p(x) \u2295 p(y) and p(k \u2299 x) = k \u2299 p(x)\nfor any x, y \u2208 V and k \u2208 K. Let the semimodules V and W be b-complete.\nA linear mapping p : V \u2192 W is said to be b-linear if it is a b-homomorphism\n3\n\n\fof the IS; this mapping is said to be a-linear if it can be extended to an\nc . Proposition 1 (see\na-homomorphism of the normal completions Vb and W\nabove) shows that a-linearity simulates (semi)continuity for linear mappings.\nc of the semifield K is a semimodule over K. If\nThe normal completion K\nc then the linear mapping p is called a linear functional.\nW = K,\nExamples of idempotent semimodules and spaces that are the most important for analysis are either subsemimodules of topological vector lattices\n[6] (or coincide with them) or are dual to them, i.e., consist of linear functionals subject to some regularity condition, for example, consist of a-linear\nfunctionals.\n4. Let V be an idempotent b-space over a b-complete semifield K, x \u2208 Vb .\nc defined by the formula x\u2217 (y) = \u2227{k \u2208\nDenote by x\u2217 the functional V \u2192 K\nK|y \u0016 k \u2299 x}, where y is an arbitrary fixed element from V .\nTheorem 1. For any x \u2208 Vb the functional x\u2217 is a-linear. Any nonzero\na-linear functional f on V is given by f = x\u2217 for a unique suitable element\nx \u2208 V . If K 6= {0, 1}, then x = \u2295{y \u2208 V |f (y) \u0016 1}.\nNote that results of this type obtained earlier concerning the structure of\nlinear functionals cannot be carried over to subspaces and subsemimodules.\nA subsemigroup W in V closed with respect to the multiplication by an\narbitrary element from K is called a b-subspace in V if the imbedding W \u2192 V\ncan be extended to a b-linear mapping. The following result is obtained from\nTheorem 1 and is the idempotent analog of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\nTheorem 2. Any a-linear functional defined on a b-subspace W in V\ncan be extended to an a-linear functional on V . If x, y \u2208 V and x 6= y, then\nthere exists an a-linear functional f on V that separates the elements x and\ny, i.e., f (x) 6= f (y).\nThe following statements are easily derived from the definitions and can\nbe regarded as the analogs of the well-known results of ordinary functional\nanalysis (the Banach\u2013Steinhaus and the closed-graph theorems).\nProposition 2. Suppose that P is a family of a-linear mappings of an\na-space V into an a-space W and the mapping p : V \u2192 W is the pointwise\nsum of the mappings of this family, i.e., p(x) = sup{p\u03b1 (x)|p\u03b1 \u2208 P }. Then\nthe mapping p is a-linear.\nProposition 3. Let V and W be a-spaces. A linear mapping p : V \u2192 W\nis a-linear if and only if its graph \u0393 in V \u00d7W is closed with respect to passing\nto sums (i.e., to least upper bounds) of its arbitrary subsets.\n5. Let K be a b-complete semifield and A be an idempotent b-space over\n4\n\n\fK equipped with the structure of a semiring compatible with the multiplication K \u00d7 A \u2192 A so that the associativity of the multiplication is preserved.\nIn this case, A is called an idempotent b-semialgebra over K.\nProposition 4. For any invertible element x \u2208 A from the b-semialgebra\nA and any element y \u2208 A, the equality x\u2217 (y) = 1\u2217 (y \u2299 x\u22121 ) holds, where\n1 \u2208 A.\nc defined by the formula (x, y) 7\u2192 hx, yi =\nThe mapping A \u00d7 A \u2192 K\n1\u2217 (x \u2299 y) is called the canonical scalar product (or simply scalar product).\nThe basic properties of the scalar product are easily derived from Proposition\n4 (in particular, the scalar product is commutative if the b-semialgebra A is\ncommutative). The following theorem is the idempotent analog of the Riesz\u2013\nFisher theorem.\nTheorem 3. Let a b-semialgebra A be a semifield. Then any nonzero\na-linear functional f on A can be represented as f (y) = hy, xi, where x \u2208 A,\nx 6= 0 and h*, *i is the canonical scalar product on A.\nRemark. Using the completion precedures, one can extend all the results\nobtained to the case of incomplete semirings, spaces, and semimodules.\n6. Example. Let B(X) be a set of all bounded functions with values\nb\nbelonging to R(max, +) on an arbitrary set X and let B(X)\n= B(X) \u222a {0}.\nThe pointwise idempotent addition of functions (\u03c61 \u2295\u03c62 )(x) = \u03c61 (x) \u2295\u03c62 (x)\nb\nand the multiplication (\u03c61 \u2299 \u03c62 )(x) = (\u03c61 (x)) \u2299 (\u03c62 (x)) define on B(X)\nthe\nstructure of a b-semialgebra over the b-complete semifield Rmax . In this\ncase, 1\u2217 (\u03c6) = supx\u2208X \u03c6(x) and the scalar product is expressed in terms\nof idempotent integration (see [1\u20133]): h\u03c61 , \u03c62 i = supx\u2208X (\u03c61 (x) \u2299 \u03c62 (x)) =\nR\u2295\n\nsupx\u2208X (\u03c61 (x) + \u03c62 (x)) = (\u03c61 (x) \u2299 \u03c62 (x)) dx. Scalar products of this type\nX\n\nwere systematically used in idempotent snslysis. Using Theorems 1 and 3,\none can easily describe a-linear functionals on idempotent spaces in terms of\nidempotent measures and integrals.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the INTAS and Russian Foundation for Basic\nResearch, joint grant no. 95\u201391.\nREFERENCES\n5\n\n\f1.
