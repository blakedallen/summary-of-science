In the case of a negative\ncosmological constant, the interest of these solutions is related to the correspondance between\ngravitating fields in an AdS space-time and the conformal field theory on the boundary of\nthe AdS space-time [1, 2].\nBlack-string solutions denote a string like generalisation of 4-D black hole solution of\nd-dimensional Einstein gravity characterized with an event horizon of topology Sd\u22123 \u00d7 S1\n[3]. Black string for d = 5 and \u039b < 0 they were first considered in [4] and then generalized\nto d dimensions in [5]. The charged counterparts of these solutions for the minimal EinsteinMaxwell (EM) gravity have been obtained recently [6]. For space-times of even dimensions\nd \u2265 6, the Sd\u22123 part of the metric can be deformed by using the ideas of [7] in such a way\nthat some rotating black string solutions can be constructed while using normal differential\nequations only. Rotating counterparts of the black strings of [5], constructed along these\nlines, are also obtained in [6]. Another direction of investigation of these objects is nonuniform black strings, where a non trivial dependence on the extra-dimension is required\n[8]. Recently, \u039b = 0 rotating nonuniform solutions have been considered as well [9].\nGeneralizing the solutions of Tangerlini [10] and of Myers-Perry [11], higher dimensional\ncharged, rotating black holes were constructed in [12] with asymptotically flat space-time\nusing the symmetries of [7]. Very recently, rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell (EM)\ntheory were constructed in [13] for odd space-time dimensions d \u2265 5 and \u039b < 0.\nThe litterature investigating higher dimensional black holes and black strings with a\npositive cosmological constant is by far less abundant, although the problem desserves to be\ninvestigated for several reasons. Namely :\ni) the recent experiments are rather consistent with a cosmological constant of the positive\nsign,\nii) as observed e.g. in [14], a positive cosmological constant can have important consequences on the physical properties of some classical solutions, these could play a role\nin inflation\niii) it is mathematically interesting to see whether the solutions available for \u039b < 0 can be\nanalytically continued for \u039b > 0,\niv) it is numerically challenging since we expect a cosmological horizon to occur at an\nintermediate value of the radial variable of space-time,\nv) connections between quantum gravity in DeSitter space-time and conformal field theory\non the boundary exist, see e.g. [15],\nvi) finally, such solutions would extend the pattern of already known solutions of Einstein\nequations in higher dimensional space-times.\nUp to now, several charged and/or rotating black holes solutions of the Einstein equations\ncoupled to an electromagnetic fields in space-times with d \u2265 4 (and \u039b > 0) are known\n[16], [17]; they are constructed with a Chern-Simons term which appears naturally in the\nbosonic sector of minimal five-dimensional supergravity. Vacuum solutions of the vacuum\n5-dimensional Einstein gravity with \u039b > 0 were obtained in [18], but a systematic study\n2\n\n\fof (rotating) solutions of the minimal Einstein-Maxwell theory (with \u039b > 0) has, to our\nknowledge, not yet been adressed. Let us mention that static black rings solutions have\nalso been constructed for 5-d DeSitter supergravity theory [19]. Solutions of the EinsteinMaxwell-dilaton system were are considered in [20] with both signs of the cosmological\nconstant.\nConsidering the minimal theories of Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell gravity with the same\nkinds of symmetries of the fields as in [13] and [6] but with a positive cosmological constant\ncan lead to solutions presenting drastic differences with respect to the case of negative\ncosmological constant, although the equations to solve are basically similar. In this paper,\nwe will reconsider the equations of [6, 13] for positive values of the cosmological constant\nand construct several families of solutions of these equations. The paper is organized as\nfollow : Sect. 2 is devoted to rotating, charged black holes in odd dimensions. The ansatz,\nthe equations, the boundary conditions and the numerical results are presented successively.\nNon-rotating and rotating black strings (in even dimensions) are described in Sect. 3,\nfollowing a similar pattern. The results are summarized in Sect. 4.\nII.\n\nBLACK HOLES\n\nWe consider the Einstein-Maxwell action with a positive cosmological constant \u039b\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nI=\nd x \u2212g(R \u2212 2\u039b \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F ) \u2212\ndd\u22121 x \u2212hK,\n16\u03c0G M\n8\u03c0G \u2202M\n\n(1)\n\nin a d\u2212dimensional spacetime.

The factor K\nrepresents the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary \u2202M and h is the induced\nmetric of the boundary.

The solutions\ncan be expanded in the neighbourhood of the horizon in the same was as in the case of a\n5\n\n\fnegative cosmological constant [13], i.e.\nb(r) = b1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2 , f (r) = f1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2 ,\nh(r) = h0 + h1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2 , w(r) = wh + w1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2 ,\na\u03c6 (r) = a0 + a1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2 , V (r) = V0 + V1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O(r \u2212 rh )2\nAlthough it is not clear if the thermodynamical properties are well defined with the\npresence of the cosmlogical horizon, one may still define them in the standard way. The\nHawking temperature and the event horizon area of these solutions can be obtained in a\nstandard way, leading to\n\u221a\nf1 b1\nTH =\n, AH = Vd\u22122 rhd\u22122 .\n(14)\n4\u03c0\nAlong with [13], we also write the mass and the angular velocity at the horizon defined by\nmeans of the appropriate Komar integrals :\nr\nr\nVd\u22122 f hg 2 \u2032\nf g 2h3 \u2032\nVd\u22122\n\u2032\nMH =\n(b \u2212 hww )|r=rh , JH =\n2\nw |r=rh\n(15)\n8\u03c0Gd\nb\n8\u03c0Gd\nb\nwhere Vd\u22122 denotes the area of the d \u2212 2 dimensional sphere.

This uses a formalism developped namely in [22, 23] and also used\nin [14, 24] The metric functions have the following asymptotic behaviour in terms of three\narbitrary constants \u03b1, \u03b2 and J\u02c6\nb(r) = \u2212\n\nr2\n\u03b1\nr2\n\u03b2\n2d\u22126\n+\n1\n+\n+\nO(1/r\n),\nf\n(r)\n=\n\u2212\n+ 1 + d\u22123 + O(1/r d\u22121),\n2\nd\u22123\n2\nl\nr\nl\nr\nJ\u02c6\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\nh(r) = r 2 (1 + d\u22121 + O(1/r 2d\u22124 )), w(r) = d\u22121 + O(1/r 2d\u22124 ),\nr\nr\n6\n\n(19)\n\n\fThe asymptotic expression of the gauge potential is similar to the asymptotically flat case\nV (r) = \u2212\n\nq\nr d\u22123\n\n+ O(1/r 2d\u22124), a\u03c6 (r) =\n\n\u03bc\u0302\nr d\u22123\n\n+ O(1/r 2d\u22124).\n\n(20)\n\nThe mass-energy of the solutions and angular momentum associated with an angular direction is\nE=\n\nVd\u22122\nVd\u22122 \u02c6\nJ .\n(\u03b2 \u2212 (d \u2212 1)\u03b1), J =\n16\u03c0Gd\n8\u03c0Gd\n\n(21)\n\nThe above relations can be proven by using a background subtraction approach or the\ncounterterm formalism [22, 23, 24].\nThe electric charge and the magnetic moment of the solutions are given by\nQ=\n\n(d \u2212 3)Vd\u22122\nq,\n4\u03c0Gd\n\n\u03bc=\n\n(d \u2212 3)Vd\u22122\n\u03bc\u0302 .\n4\u03c0Gd\n\n(22)\n\nThe ansatz in f, b, h has to advantage to present a direct connection with the closed\nform vacuum rotating solution.\nE.\n\nNumerical results\n\nThe system of equations above does not admit, to our knowledge, explicit solutions\nfor generic values of wh and Vh . We therefore relied on a numerical method to construct\nsolutions. We solved the equations in the case d = 5 and we hope that this case catches the\nqualitative properties of the pattern of the solutions; the numerical solver Colsys [25] was\nused throughout this paper.\nThe positive cosmological constant leads to the occurence of a cosmological horizon at\nr = rc (with rh < rc < \u221e) where f (rc ) = b(rc ) = 0. This creates a difficulty since rc\nconstitutes an apparent singular point of the equations. In order to overcome this difficulty,\nwe have solved the equations in two steps. In the first step, we supplemented the system by\nthe trivial equation dl2 /dx = 0 and impose the conditions of two regular horizon at r = rh\nand r = rc , fixing rc , rh by hand and solve the equations for r \u2208 [rh , rc ]. The appropriate set\nof twelfe boundary conditions at the two horizons then read\nf = 0 , b = 0 , b\u2032 = 1 , w = wh , V = 0 , a\u2032 = a\u2032h , \u03931 = 0 , \u03932 = 0 for r = rh\nf = 0 , b = 0 , \u03931 = 0 , \u03932 = 0 for r = rc\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThe functions \u03931,2 are defined above; here we take advantage of the arbitrary scale of the\nfield b(r) to impose b\u2032 (rh ) = 1 and of the arbitrary additive constant of the electric potential\nto assume V (rh ) = 0. The function b(r) will be renormalized appropiately after the second\nstep in order to set (19). The values wh and a\u2032h are, a priori, arbitrary and control the total\nangular momentum and the (electric and magnetic) charges of the black hole.\nThe numerical value of l2 is determined by the first step, together with the values of\nall the fields at r = rc . Use of these fields and of the value of l2 can then be used as a\nsuitable set of Cauchy data to solve the equations for r \u2208 [rc , \u221e]. The disatvantage of the\nmethod is that we cannot perform a systematic analysis of the solution for a fixed value of\n7\n\n\fthe cosmological constant. Fortunately, the numerical value of l2 depends only a little on\nw(rh ) and a(rh ) once rh , rc are fixed.\nIn the following, we present the results corresponding to rh = 1, rc = 3, this case corresponds to a large value of the coupling constant but allows one to analyze the effect of \u039b on\nthe solution. We hope that the results for this case capture the main features of the solutions\nfor generic values of \u039b The profiles of the solution corresponding to wh = 0.6, a\u2032h = 0.5 are\npresented in Fig. 1. It corresponds to 1/l2 = 0.0945 and q = \u22120.08538. The smoothness of\nthe profile at r = rc can be appreciated on the plot. It is also worth to point out that the\nnumerical solutions approach the asymptotic behaviour (19) although all boundary conditions are imposed at r = rc for the second step of our construction. We supplemented Fig.\n1 with the plot of the tt component of the metric gtt = b \u2212 hw 2 , showind that there is a\nsmall region around the event horizon where gtt is negative, defining an ergoradius re where\ngtt (re ) = 0 (on the figure, re \u2248 1.17).\n\nFIG. 1: The profiles of a generic solution correponding to rh = 1, rc = 3 , wh = 0.6, a\u2032h = 0.5\n\nWe manage to construct several branches of solutions for different values of a\u2032h and increasing the parameter wh . For fixed a\u2032h , the solutions exist only for sufficiently large values\nof wh , this is illustrated on Fig.2 where we plot the asymptotic charges M, J, Q, \u03bc as functions of wh for two values of a\u2032h ; for a\u2032h = 0.1 (resp. a\u2032h = 0.5) the branch exist for wh > 0.1\n(resp. wh > 0.465). We strongly suspect that another branch of solutions, with a larger\nmass exist, terminating at the same value of wh but we cannot construct it at this moment.\nThe numerical integration between the two horizons and the related constraints make the\nconstruction of an eventual second branch very tricky. We nevertheless observe that the\nasymptotic mass is positive for all values of the parameters that we have explored. The\nfigure further suggests that, if a second branch exists, its asymptotic mass will be larger\nthan the one of the first branch that we constructed. The magnetic moment is rather in8\n\n\fdependant on the parameter wh . Also, when we solved the equation for larger values of rc ,\ncorresponding to smaller values of \u039b, we observe that the asymptotic quantities plotted on\nFig. 2 depend weakly on rc .\nThe numerical values of the different fields at the horizon rh are presented on Figs. 3 and\n\nFIG. 2: The asymptotic charges M, J, Q, \u03bc are presented as functions of wh for a\u2032h = 0.1 and\na\u2032h = 0.5\n\n4 for the case a\u2032h = 0.1 and a\u2032h = 0.5 respectively. The value ah is negative and depends\nweakly on wh , e.g. we find ah \u223c \u22120.049 (resp. ah \u223c \u22120.215) for a\u2032h = 0.1 (resp. a\u2032h = 0.5);\ncorrespondingly we find l2 \u223c 10.3 and l2 \u223c 10.6 (l2 is indicated on Fig. 4 only).\nThe physical parameters characterizing the solutions at the horizon can then be computed\nfrom the numerical data. In particular, the natural normalisation of the function b (i.e.\nsuch that b(r) \u2192 \u2212r 2 /l2 for r \u2192 \u221e) which renders the space-time asymptoticall DeSitter\nis determined from the solution in the asymptotic region. On Fig. 5, we have superposed\nthe Hawking Temperature TH , the mass and angular momentum at the horizon as functions\nof the parameter wh for the solutions obtained with a\u2032 (xh ) = 0.1 (corresponding to 1/l2 =\n0.097) and existing for wh > 0.1 and a\u2032 (xh ) = 0.5 (corresponding to 1/l2 = 0.094) and\nexisting for hh > 0.462). We see in particular that the Komar mass is positive at the even\nhorizon. For the sake of completeness, the same quantities relative to the cosmological\nhorizon rc are presented on Fig. 6. These physical parameters depend only weakly of a\u2032 (rh )\nwhen the parameter wh becomes sufficiently large. We note that the mass Mc is negative due\nto the fact that b\u2032 (rc ) is negative and the rotation energy, although positive, is not enough\nto make the combination in 15 positive at r = rc .\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 3: Some numerical parameters characterizing the solution at the horizon as functions of wh\nfor a\u2032h = 0.1\nIII.\n\nBLACK STRINGS\n\nBlack strings solutions can also be constructed in the framework of the model (1) but we\nwill limit our investigations to pure gravity in this case. One of the spacelike dimensions of\nspace-time, say z \u2261 xd\u22121 plays a special role in a sense that the metric is the warped product\nof a d\u22121-dimensional black hole metric with the extra dimension. The corresponding horizon\nhas the topology of Sd\u22123 \u00d7 S1 [3]. In the case of non-rotating, uniform black strings, the\nfields do not depend on the coordinate z and the metric takes the form\nds2 = a(r)dz 2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03a92d\u22123 \u2212 b(r)dt2\nf (r)\n\n(25)\n\nwhere d\u03a92d\u22123 denotes the metric on sphere S d\u22123 . Solutions of the corresponding Einstein\nequations are constructed in [5] for \u039b < 0 and in [18] for \u039b > 0. For d even, the part of the\nmetric related to the d \u2212 3-dimensional sphere can be deformed according to the lines of Eq.\n(2) and rotating black strings can be constructed.

The first condition above is necessary to produce\na \"'black\"' object, the second one is necessary for regularity of the equation for b. The\nthird and fourth conditions fix the arbitrary scales of the functions a and b. Finally the last\ncondition involves an arbitrary parameter wh which control the angular velocity of the black\nstring at the horizon. The Horizon mass and angular velocity of the solution can, again, be\ndetermined with suitable Komar integrals, leading to\ns\nr\nf\naf g 2 h3 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nMh =\n(b\n\u2212\nhww\n)\n,\nJ\n=\n2\nw |r=rh\n(31)\nbhg 2\nb\n13\n\n\fThe complete specification of the boundary values needs three extra conditions which have\nto be looked for in the asymptotic region. Examining the asymptotic behaviour compatible\nwith the classical equations reveals at least two possibilities.

Correspondingly, the Kretschmann invariant approached a constant asymptotically.\nHowever (32) is not the only possibility, there exist a second one where the fields decay\npower likely according to\na(r) = A(\n\n2\nr 2 \u03b1/2\nr 2 \u03b2/2\nr 2 \u03c6/2\n2\n4 l \u03c9/2\n)\n,\nb(r)\n=\nB(\n)\n,\nf\n(r)\n=\nF\n(\n)\n,\ng(r)\n=\nr\n,\nw(r)\n=\n\u03a9\nl\n(\n)\nl2\nl2\nl2\nr2\n(33)\n\nwith\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u22122(d\u22123)\u2212\n\np\n\n2(d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3) , \u03c6 = 2(d\u22122)+2\n\np\n\n2(d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3) , \u03c9 = 2+\n\n\u03c6\n(34)\n4\n\nThis leads to a singularity of the Kretschmann invariant in the limit r \u2192 \u221e for d > 3. More\ndetails about the asymptotic expansion of (33) are presented in the next section.\nB.\n\nNon rotating solution\n\nIn the case w = 0, the equation for w is trivial and the equation for g is satisfied by\ng = r 2 . We will show that the remaining equations can be written in a decoupled form. We\nconsider both \u039b > 0 and \u039b < 0 ; to this use, we define \u01eb = \u2212\u039b/|\u039b|.\nFirst, let us define\n\nra\u2032\nrb\u2032\nB(r) =\na\nb\nin terms of which the equations for f, a, b rewrite :\nA(r) =\n\nrf \u2032 = 2(d \u2212 4) (k \u2212 f ) \u2212 2(d \u2212 1)\nrB \u2032 f = (d \u2212 1)(2 \u2212 B)\n\nr2\n\u2212 f (r) (A + B)\n\u01ebl2\n\nr2\n\u2212 (d \u2212 4)kB = 0\n\u01ebl2\n\n(AB + 2(d \u2212 3)(A + B) \u2212 2(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4)) f = 2k(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4) \u2212 2(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2)\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\nr2\n(38)\n\u01ebl2\n\nSolving the third equation for A = A(B, f ), substituting A(B, f ) in the first equation and solving for B = B(f, f \u2032 ) and finaly evaluating the second equation with A =\nA(B(f, f \u2032 ), f ), B = B(f, f \u2032 ) leads to the following decoupled equations :\n14\n\n\f2\n\nr ff\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\nr2\n= \u2212rf f + (rf ) + 2 (d \u2212 1) \u2212 (d \u2212 4) 2\n\u01ebl\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nr2\nr\n\u2212 2(d \u2212 4) (d \u2212 1) \u2212 (d \u2212 4) 2 f \u2212 3 k(d \u2212 1) \u2212 (d \u2212 4) 2 rf \u2032\n\u01ebl\n\u01ebl\n\u2032 2\n\n\u2032\n\n(39)\n\nB\u00b1 = \u2212B\u0303(r, d, l)\ns\n\u00b1\n\n(40)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nrf \u2032\nr2 1\n1\n\u2212 2(d \u2212 3)\n\u2212 2(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 4) 2\nB\u0303(r, d, l)2 \u2212 2(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4) 1 \u2212\nf\nf\n\u01ebl f\n\n\u0010\nwhere B\u0303(r, d, l) \u2261 (d \u2212 4) +\n\n1 rf \u2032\n2 f\n\n+ (d \u2212\n\n4) f1\n\n\u2212 (d \u2212\n\n2\n\n2\n1) f1 \u01eblr 2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22122(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) \u01eblr 2 + 2(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4)f + 2(d \u2212 3)f B\nA=\n2(d \u2212 3)f + f B\n\n(41)\n\nNote that the decoupling is still valid in the more general case considered in [5] where\ntopological black holes are investigated as well (i.e. space-times where the spherical part\n2\nd\u03c9d\u22123\nin (25) is replaced by the metric of an hyperbolic or flat manifold with the same\ndimensions)\nC.\n\nAsymptotics\n\nWe have not been able to solve (40) explicitely, but we can study the asymptotic behavour\nof f with this equation. In fact, at first order, it appears that\nf (r) \u2248 F0 r \u03c6\n\n(42)\n\nfor a constant F0 and for any \u03c6 \u2208 {2}\u222a]4, \u2192, so we cannot conclude on the asymptotic\nbehavour of f at this point. In fact, it is not possible to fix analytically \u03c6, but it is possible\nto give a description of the asymptotic behavour of the metric functions in terms of only\none parameter.\nWe have to consider two cases : \u03c6 = 2 and \u03c6 > 4. In the case \u01eb = +1, where the\ncosmological constant is negative, asymptotics obey \u03c6 = 2 [5]. In the case \u01eb = \u22121, there are\nstrong evidence that \u03c6 = 2 leads to singular solutions [18]. Since this paper focus on the\ncase \u01eb = \u22121, we will assume \u03c6 > 4, which is equivalent to assume that the argument in five\ndimensions generalises to d dimensions.\nIt turns out that the asymptotic behavour of the metric functions is given by a one\nparameter family of functions:\n\u03b2 2 + 2(d \u2212 4)\u03b2 + 2(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4)\nf \u2192 F0 r , \u03c6 = \u2212\n\u03b2 + 2(d \u2212 3)\n\u03c6\n\n15\n\n(43)\n\n\fA(r) \u2192 \u03b1(\u03b2) = \u2212\n\n2(d \u2212 3)(d \u2212 4) + 2(d \u2212 3)\u03b2\n\u03b2 + 2(d \u2212 3)\n\n(44)\n\nB(r) \u2192 \u03b2\n\n(45)\n\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03c6 + 2(d \u2212 4) = 0\n\n(46)\n\nSince these behavour are compatible with the equations of motion for each value of \u03b2\nsuch that \u03c6 > 4, it is not possible to fix \u03b2 without more asomptions, but there are strong\nnumerical evidences for a(r) = b(r) at first order in the asymptotic region. This means that\nthe value of \u03b2 chosen by the system is a fixed point of \u03b1(\u03b2) are exactly the values (34). Note\nthe particular relation between the exponents :\n\nWe have constructed the higher order corrections for the function f (r) and obtained\nf (r) = F0 r \u03c6 \u2212\n\nd \u2212 1 r2\nd\u22124\n+\n2\nd\u22123+\u03b2 l\nd\u22124+\u03b2\n\n(47)\n\nwith \u03c6 discussed previously. The reparametrisation of F0 used in (33) figure out the peculiar\ndependance of the solution under rescaling of l and r\n\nD.\n\nEnergy of the solution\n\nThe energy of the solution is given by the following quantity [21]\nZ\nd\u22122\nN (Kd\u22122 \u2212 K0,d\u22122 )\nE = \u22122MP\n\n(48)\n\nSt\u221e\n\nwhere MP is the Planck Mass, N being the full spacetime lapse function.\nThe trace extrinsic curvature of the border at fixed time, K(d\u22122) is well defined, although\nspace-time is asymptotically singular :\n!\np\n(d \u2212 3) + \u03b22\nK(d\u22122) = f\n(49)\nr\nThis quantity, once integrated according to (48), is not divergent. That's the reason why\nwe won't consider a reference background. Moreover, it is not clear wich background to use\nwith such an asymptotic.\nWe can now compute the energy of the solutions which exhibits an asymptotic behavour\nas described in the previous section. By (46), the energy is simply given by\np\nE = MPd\u22122 Ad\u22123 L 2F0 (d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3)\n(50)\n\nwhere L is the length of the extradimension in the y direction and Ad\u22123 is the area of the\nunit d \u2212 3 sphere. This energy is finite and depend only on F0 wich depends essentially on\nthe dimension of space-time and of the cosmological constant, further results will be given\nin Sect. 3.7.\n16\n\n\fE.\n\nGeodesic Equations and Curvature Invariant\n\nWe computed the Kreshman curvature invariant (29): and it turns out that the spacetime\nis asymptotically singular, with the asymptotic behavour of previous section.\nMoreover, the geodesic equation at fixed \u03b8i (the angular sector of the metric),\n\u1e59 2 =\n\nE2 Z2\n\u2212\n\u2212 m2\nb\na\n\n(51)\n\nwhere E, Z are conserved quantities along the geodesic, implies that this singularity can be\nreached in a finite proper time for an observer of mass m from outside the horizon. A similar\nresult holds for null motion.\nF.\n\nNumerical Results\n\nWe solved numerically equations (35), (36) and (37) with the boundary conditions for\nmany values of the horizon rh . It turns out that in the regular case, the asumption a = b\nholds everywhere, independently of the number of dimensions. This can be understood since\na and b both play a \"spectator role\" in the metric. Nothing explicitely depends on z, neither\non t in the metric, so in a sense, a and b play the same role, at least in the regular case, since\nthe initial values for a and b are the same On fig.6, we present the evolution of the ratio\nrf \u2032 /f for non rotating black string solutions and for several values of d and rh = 0.5 . The\nfigure clearly demonstrates that the power law configuration (33) is approached. The exact\nvalues of the exponents coincide with our numerical values within the numerical accuracy\nrequired for the numerics, i.e. typically 10\u22128 .\nHowever, nothing garanties that this asumption will still hold true in the black string\ncase, because the boundary conditions break this \"symetry\". We checked numerically the\nvalidity of the asumption a = b in the asymptotic region and it turned out that it is still\nverified. Moreover, we noticed that the ratio a/b behaves like 1/rh for the normalisation of\nb we used. This factor can be absorbed in a rescalling of t. It is reasonable to think that\na natural rescaling of t is such that a/b \u2192 C, with C independant of rh . This implies that\nb\u2032 (rh ) = f \u2032 (rh ) wich reminds the 4-dimensionnal Schwarzchild (with or without cosmological\nconstant).\nWe also investigated the solution in the interior region, i.e. for r \u2264 rh , to check whether\nthere exist a second horizon which would \"'hide the asymptotic singularity\"', but it turns\nout that this is not the case. We have a naked singularities both, at r = 0 and at r = \u221e. We\nare tempted to interpret this solution as an hypercylindre with an horizon at some equator\nby matching the origin with the point at infinity by means of an appropriate system of\ncoordinates, still to be found, but that we expect to exist.\nG.\n\nRotating black strings\n\nIn absence of explicit solutions, we have integrated numerically the equations for rotating\nblack strings for r \u2208 [rh , \u221e] for several values of rh and wh by trying to interpolate between\nthe local behaviour (30) and one of the possible asymptotic behaviours (32) or (33). Here we\nsolved the equations for d = 6 but the results obtained for non rotating black string for d > 6\n17\n\n\fFIG. 7: The ratio xf \u2032 /f is given for several values of d\n\nstrongly suggest that rotating solutions exist also for higher dimensions. As can be expected\nfrom the non rotating case, our numerical results strongly suggest that the rotating solutions\nbehaving regularly at the event horizon naturally evolve into the asymptotics determined\nby (33). The profiles of a rotating black string corresponding to rh = 0.5, wh = 0.5 is\npresented of Fig. 8. The metric functions profile are shown on this figure. We supplemented\ngtt = b \u2212 r 2 \u03c9 2 , showing that there is a small ergoregion about the horizon where gtt < 0 for\nrh \u2264 r \u2264 re where re denotes the ergo-horizon (on the figure re \u2248 0.537). For this solution\nwe further found F \u2248 1.125, A \u2248 0.0741, B \u2248 0.0186 and \u03a9 \u2248 0.0073 for the parameters\ndefined in (33).\nWe also studied the dependance of different parameters characterizing the solution as\nfunctions of rh and wh . One main feature is that the values of F, A, B depend weakly of\nthese parameters (e.g. for wh = 0.5, rh = 0.8 we find F \u2248 1.125, A \u2248 0.0738, B \u2248 0.0260).\nThe dependance of \u03a9 on wh is more sensible. On fig. 9 we have superposed \u03a9, f1 , wh\u2032\nand the ergo-horizon re as functions of wh for rh = 0.5. The qualititive behaviour of these\nparameters remains similar for different values of rh . We noticed that, while increasing wh ,\nthe function w(r) becomes very peaked at the horizon, with a large derivative w \u2032 (xh ). This\nrenders the numerical integration tricky in this region but we have not detected a signal of\na second branch of rotating black string.\nBefore finishing this section, we would like to mention that an analytic solution of the\nLagrangian under consideration is available in the case d = 4 [26], see also [27] where\nthis solution is interpreted in the context of gravitating cosmic strings. This solution was\nobtained with a different parametrisation of the metric, the correspondic space-time becomes\nperiodic in the radial variable; the Kretschmann scalar possesses singularities, so this solution\nis clearly not of the DeSitter type asymptotically.\n18\n\n\fFIG. 8: The profiles of a rotating black string for rh = wh = 0.5\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the Einstein-Maxwell equations in space-times of arbitrary\ndimensions d and with a positive cosmological constant. By using appropriate ansatzes for\nthe metric and the U(1)-fields, the equations can be transformed into a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations for odd values of d in the case of black holes and even d for black\nstrings. Imposing a consistent set of boundary conditions, we solved these equation numerically, constructed several families of rotating black holes and black string solutions. For\nboth cases, the conditions of an event horizon are imposed ar r = rh . The main difference\nbetween black holes and black strings resides in the way space-times reaches its asymptotic\nform. In the case of black holes, space-time becomes asymptotically DeSitter, after crossing\na regular cosmological horizon. In the case of black strings, our numerical results strongly\nsuggest that the metric fields evolve asymptotically according to some power of the radial\nvariable r with well specified non integer exponants depending on d. The evaluation of the\nKretschmann invariant reveals that space-time become singular in the limit r \u2192 \u221e for\nd \u2265 5. In order to confirm these numerical results by an analytic argument, we manage\nto put the equations of [4, 5] in a decoupled form which makes slighly easier to construct\nthe next to leading order of the asymptotic evolution of the fields. Althought we were not\nable to give an exact solutions to this decoupled form, we found interesting informations on\nthe behavour of the solutions. We also showed that the energy of this kind of solution is finite.\n\n19\n\n\fFIG. 9: The values of g, f \u2032 , w\u2032 at the horizon, of the ergo radius and the parameter \u03a9 are presented\nas functions of wh for rh = 0.5\n\nAcknowledgments Y.B. acknowledges B.
