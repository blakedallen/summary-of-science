For realistic (small) values of \u03c3, the two strands\ndo not recombine, even for small mutation fractions. Thus, molecular recognition is extremely\nselective.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Natural DNA exists as a double-helix strand. Upon heating, the two\nstrands may separate. This unbinding transition is called DNA denaturation. The reverse\nprocess of binding is called renaturation, recombination, or, in a more biological wording,\nrecognition.\nThe Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation [1, 2, 3] has been recently revisited from\nrather different points of view [4,5,6,7,8]. The physics approach [5,6,7,8] considers the phase\ntransition of the homopolymeric model (a single pairing or stacking energy). The transition is\na first order transition, if the excluded volume interaction between the two strands is properly\nsl\ntaken into account. In a nutshell, one models the weight of a loop of l bases as \u03c3 elc , where\ns is the entropy per base pair in a loop, c is an exponent describing intra- and inter-strand\nexcluded volume, and the cooperativity parameter \u03c3 is generally taken as unity. For c > 2,\na first order (denaturation) transition occurs. Previous models relied on a value of c \u223c 1.8,\ncorresponding to a second order transition.\nOn the other hand, Yeramian [4] used the original Poland-Scheraga model (with c < 2) to\nstudy the denaturation transition of real DNA sequences (that is with 10 different stacking\nenergies). Apart from minor differences (stacking vs. pairing energies, inclusion of the entropy\ns in the Boltzmann weight), this realistic approach relies on the use of a factor \u03c3 \u2243 10\u22125 \u221210\u22126 ,\nin marked contrast to the value \u03c3 = O(1) used by physicists. The physical origin of \u03c3 is the\noverlap of the \u03c0 orbitals of the (deoxy)ribose rings of stacked bases. A small \u03c3 value means\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nthat opening a loop is very costly, and leads to a very sharp (cooperative) first order like\ndenaturation transition. This sharpness allows Yeramian to identify coding regions in real\nDNA sequences as having a higher melting temperature than the non-coding ones. The\ninterplay between the values of c > 2 and \u03c3 was recently studied [9] for some DNA sequences,\nin particular with respect to the Meltsim program [10], where c = 1.75 and \u03c3 \u223c 10\u22125 .\nAn important puzzle for physicists is how the extreme selectivity required by the biological\nmachinery can be achieved in spite of the very high entropy of non selective binding. For\ninstance, in a DNA micro-array, single strands of DNA are grafted on a surface. When\nthis array is immersed in a solution containing complementary and mutated strands, the\nrecognition process occurs with a high accuracy, with a very low rate of errors.\nIn this letter, we address these issues, allowing for mismatches in the renaturation process.\nOur line of thought is as follows: if loops are not costly energy-wise, one may a priory consider\nthat mismatches between the two strands (i.e. base \u03b1 of the first strand being paired or stacked\nwith base \u03b2 of the second) play an important role. In the homopolymeric case, it is easy to\nsee that the sole effect of mismatches is to replace the exponent c by c \u2212 1.\nWhat we want to do in this letter is to adopt a pragmatic point of view, leaving theoretical\nideas for a longer paper [11]. We will mostly work at c = 1.8, using different values of the\ncooperativity parameter \u03c3. We have checked that our results do not change significantly when\nusing c = 2.15 as suggested in ref.( [6]).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: we first recall a few facts on the algorithmic aspects\nof the problems with- and without- mismatches, and how to speed up calculations. The\ncomparison between the two cases will be first studied for complementary sequences. For \u03c3\nsmall, mismatches can be ignored, while they are essential for \u03c3 \u223c O(1). Finally, we consider\nthe case of non complementary sequences, and argue that small values of \u03c3 are not very\ntolerant to mutations, in marked contrast to the case \u03c3 \u223c O(1).\nSummary of Poland-Scheraga theory. \u2013 We first consider two complementary strands of\nlength N , and we denote by Z(\u03b1) the partition function of the two strands originating at\nbase 1 and paired at base \u03b1. Using Z(1) = 1, Z(2) = e\u2212\u03b2\u03b51,2;1,2 as boundary conditions, the\noriginal Poland-Scheraga (PS) calculation can be recast in the recursion relation\nZ(\u03b1) = Z(\u03b1 \u2212 1) e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1 + \u03c3\n\n\u03b1\u22122\nX\n\nZ(\u03b1\u2032 )N (2(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 ))\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1\u2032 =1\n\nwhere \u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1 is the stacking energy between bases \u03b1 \u2212 1 and \u03b1, \u03c3 is the cooperativity\nparameter (that is the loop fugacity), and N (2(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 )) is the number of closed loops of length\n2(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 ). Equation (1) expresses the fact that pairing of base pair \u03b1 may result either from\nstacking base pairs \u03b1 \u2212 1 and \u03b1 or closing a loop at \u03b1\u2032 . The scaling form of the number of\nclosed loops of length l is given by [12]\nN (l) = esl /lc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere s is the entropy per base in a loop, and c is a critical exponent, depending on the model\nused for the polymeric model. For a Brownian chain, one has c = 3/2, whereas c \u2243 1.8 for\na self-avoiding chain. For interacting self-avoiding loops, it has been argued that one should\nuse c \u2243 2.15 [6].\nNote that eq.(1) can be backtracked (at least at low temperature) in order to determine\nwhich fragments of the chain are bound, and which ones are unbound. For that purpose, one\niterates the recursion (1) till \u03b1 = N , keeping track of all the Z(\u03b1). Going from N to N \u2212 1,\none keeps in (1) the one term of the r.h.s. which is dominant. If it is the first term, it implies\n\n\fT. Garel and H. Orland: On the role of mismatches in DNA denaturation\n\n3\n\nthat the last pair is stacked, whereas if it is one of the other terms of the sum, say \u03b1\u2032 , there is\na loop which ends at \u03b1\u2032 . By iterating this procedure, one ends up with the full conformational\nstructure of the chain.\nWe recall that the stacking energies have been shown to describe nucleotides interactions\nin a much more accurate fashion than simple base pairing. The idea is that in addition to the\nusual Crick-Watson pairing, there is a big component of the binding energy originating from\nthe stacking of the ribose rings. In practice, this is modeled by assuming that the interactions\ndepend on pairs of adjacent bases on the two strands, namely are of the form \u03b5i,i+1;j,j+1\ninstead of \u03b5i;j . Since there are four different bases, there are in principle 44 = 256 possible\nstacking energies, out of which only 10 turn out to be non zero.\nIn the homogeneous case \u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1 = \u03b5, a Laplace transform with respect to \u03b1 allows\nto solve exactly equation (1), yielding a continuous (if 1 < c < 2) or discontinuous (if c >\n2) transition. For (c < 1), the strands are bound at all temperatures. Note that in the\nhomogeneous case, the transition temperature is given by\nTc =\n\n\u03b5\nP\nc\ns \u2212 log(1 + \u03c3 \u221e\nl=1 1/l )\n\n(3)\n\nThis equation shows the very weak dependence of the critical temperature on the loop exponent c for physical values of \u03c3 (\u2243 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22126 ).\nFrom a more practical perspective, solving numerically equation (1) requires a CPU time\nof order N 2 . The Fixman-Freire method [13, 14] reduces this CPU time to order N by approximating the loop factor by\nI\nX\n1\nai e\u2212bi l\n(4)\n\u2243\nlc\ni=1\nIn equation (4) the number I of couples (ai , bi ) depends on the desired accuracy. For a\nsequence of length 1000, the value I = 9 gives an accuracy better than 0.5%. Larger values\n(I = 14) are used in [4] for lengths of 150000 base pairs or in the program Meltsim [10].\nTo be complete, a special treatment is required for the extremities. Indeed, the number of\nconformations of a segment of length l at the extremities of the chain is\nN (l) \u2243 esl l\u03b3\u22121\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the exponent \u03b3 \u2243 1.15. Thus, one should slightly modify the above recursion at the\norigin to account for this fact.\nMismatch. \u2013 We again consider two strands of length N and N \u2032 , and denote by \u03b1 (resp.\n\u03b2) the base index of the first (resp. the second) strand. Let Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) be the partition function\nwith bases \u03b1 and \u03b2 paired (in these notations, the PS model corresponds to \u03b1 = \u03b2). Using the\nsame kind of boundary conditions as in the previous Section, Z(1, 1) = 1, Z(\u03b1, 1) = Z(1, \u03b1) =\n0, for any \u03b1 = 2, ..., N (N \u2032 ) and Z(2, 2) = e\u2212\u03b2\u03b51,2;1,2 , we may write\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) = Z(\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2 \u2212 1) e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b2\u22121,\u03b2\n+\u03c3\n\n\u03b1\u22121\nX \u03b2\u22121\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b1\u2032 ,\u03b1\u22121) \u03b4(\u03b2 \u2032 ,\u03b2\u22121) )Z(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )N (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 )\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b1\u2032 =1 \u03b2 \u2032 =1\n\nThe interpretation of equation (6) is the same as in equation (1). In the homogeneous case\n(\u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b2\u22121,\u03b2 = \u03b5), one may again solve the problem: the results are the same as the (PS)\nmodel, except that c is replaced by c \u2212 1, e.g. a discontinuous transition occurs for c \u2212 1 > 2.\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nThis equation can be backtracked exactly as was explained in the previous section to obtain\nthe conformations of the chains at low temperature.\nIn the following, we shall be interested in strands of equal lengths N . From an algorithmic\npoint of view, equation (6) shows that the calculation of the partition function, with our\nboundary conditions, is of order N 4 (in the conclusion, we briefly discuss the influence of\nthe boundary conditions on this result). In what follows, we have used a Fixman-Freire\napproximation to reduce this N 4 power to a factor N 2 \u00d7I 2 . Similar reductions were previously\nobtained in studies of the denaturation of circular DNA [15].\nDefining\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 X\nX\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212bj (\u03b1+\u03b2)\nSj (\u03b1, \u03b2) = e\nebj (\u03b1 +\u03b2 ) Z(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )\n(7)\n\u03b1\u2032 =1 \u03b2 \u2032 =1\n\nfor j = 1, ..., I, it can easily be seen that these functions satisfy the recurrence\nSj (\u03b1, \u03b2) = e\u2212bj (Sj (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2212 1) + Sj (\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2)) \u2212 e\u22122bj Sj (\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2 \u2212 1) + W\u03b1\u03b2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22122bj\n\u2212bj\nSj (\u03b1 \u2212 2, \u03b2 \u2212 2)\n+ V\u03b1\u03b2 Sj (\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2 \u2212 1) \u2212 e (Sj (\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2 \u2212 2) + Sj (\u03b1 \u2212 2, \u03b2 \u2212 1)) + e\n(8)\nwhere W\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c3\nconditions are\n\nPI\n\nl=1\n\nal e\u2212bl Sl (\u03b1 \u2212 1, \u03b2 \u2212 1) and V\u03b1\u03b2 = e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u03b1\u22121,\u03b1;\u03b2\u22121,\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c3.

With a number of components I \u2243 10, this allows to\nstudy sequences of size up to 1000 in a reasonable computer time.\nOur numerical calculations have been done on the first 1000 bases of a fugu gene [16]. We\nhave worked with I = 9 (ai , bi ) pairs. Since we are interested in finite sequences, we took\nthe Flory value c = 1.8 for the loop exponent (for \u03c3 small, the melting curves for real DNA\nsequences are very insensitive to the value of c, as can be inferred from eq.(3)). Finally the\nstacking energies are the ones used in the program Meltsim [10].\nThe order parameter in DNA denaturation is usually taken as the fraction of bound base\npairs, denoted as \u03b8. This quantity can be measured by UV absorption at 268 nm [17]. The\nderivative \u2212d\u03b8/dT with respect to temperature displays sharp peaks at the temperatures\nwhere various fragments of the sequence open. In the following, for practical reasons, we shall\nstudy the specific heat rather than the order parameter. Indeed, for a homopolymer, the\nfraction \u03b8 is proportional to the internal energy of the chain, and thus \u2212d\u03b8/dT is proportional\nto the specific heat. In the case where there is a non homogeneous sequence, it can be\neasily checked that the peaks of the specific heat coincide with those of the order parameter\nderivative.\nComplementary strands: the role of \u03c3. \u2013 Using equations (1) and (6), we have compared\nthe specific heat of the PS model with the specific heat of the model with mismatches.\n\n\fT.

We have solved the recursion for a homopolymer of size 1000. For \u03c3 = 1,\nthe specific heats of the two models are wildly different, whereas for \u03c3 = 10\u22125 there is a sharp\npeak in both specific heats. These peaks are located exactly at the same place, the difference\nbetween the two cases being that the height of the peak in the mismatch case is finite, whereas\nit scales with the size of the chain for the PS case.\nWe now consider the reference sequence defined above, for different values of \u03c3. For\n\u03c3 = 10\u22125 (Fig. 1), the curves can be superimposed, whereas the two models differ considerably\nfor \u03c3 = 1 (Fig. 2). This means that for physical (small) values of \u03c3, mismatches between\ntwo complementary strands are negligible at any temperatures. The physical reason is that\nalthough mismatches are entropically favorable, they are suppressed by the high energetical\ncost of initiating a loop. This cost vanishes for \u03c3 \u2243 1.\nRandom mutations: the role of \u03c3. \u2013 We have generated random mutations on one strand,\nstarting from the complementary sequence. Our procedure is as follows: we mutate each base\non this strand independently with probability p; if the mutation is accepted, the mutated base\nis different from the old one. Equation (6) is then implemented numerically.\nFor small values of \u03c3, the melting temperatures decrease with increasing values of p, as\ndoes the sharpness of the peaks as shown in (Fig. 3 and 5) for typical samples. Mutations\nthat are far along the sequence are disfavored and the strands \"unbind\" more easily. For a\nmutation rate p of order 0.5% (corresponding to a typical number of mutated bases between 4\nand 6 in the reference sequence), recognition between the strands is already poor. For larger\nvalues of \u03c3 (Fig. 4), the presence of mismatches considerably lessens the role of mutations.\nConclusion. \u2013 In this letter we have studied why mismatches can be neglected in DNA\ndenaturation and recognition. We have argued that this is related mostly to the small value\nof the cooperativity parameter \u03c3. We have seen that it is this very small value of \u03c3 which\nforces the very strong specificity in the DNA renaturation process. In other words, \u03c3 defines\na length scale lL \u223c 1/\u03c3 which characterizes the typical distance between loops. For a realistic\nvalue of \u03c3 \u2243 10\u22125 , this amounts to lengths of order 100000 base pairs. One expects significant\neffects of mismatches only beyond that length scale.\nWe have checked that all our results are very insensitive to the loop exponent c, as long as\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n6000.0\n\n150.0\n\n4000.0\n\n100.0\n\nC\n\nC\n\n2000.0\n\n0.0\n70.0\n\n50.0\n\n80.0\n\n90.0\n\n0.0\n70.0\n\n100.0\n\n80.0\n\nT\n\n90.0\n\n100.0\n\nT\n\nFig. 3\n\nFig. 4\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Effect of mutations: Specific heat for p = 0.005 (continuous curve) and p = 0 (long dashed\ncurve) for \u03c3 = 10\u22125 .\nFig. 4 \u2013 Effect of mutations: Specific heat for p = 0.005 (continuous curve) and p = 0 (long dashed\ncurve) for \u03c3 = 1\n\nthe loop fugacity \u03c3 is small enough. Finally, the backtracking procedure can provide physical\ninformations about the boundaries of helical regions.\nWith our fixed boundary conditions (where the two extremities of each strands are fixed\nand paired) we have reduced the CPU time from N 4 to N 2 \u00d7 I 2 through the use of a FixmanFreire approximation. For general boundary conditions, we would get another N 4 factor from\nrelaxing the constraints on the extremities. This last factor can also be scaled down. Indeed,\nconsider adding phantom paired links to the two extremities of each strands, namely 0\u03b1 ,0\u03b2\nand, (N + 1)\u03b1 ,(N + 1)\u03b2 . The stacking energy of these phantom bases is taken to be 0. By\nthis addition of phantom bases at the origin and at the extremity of the two strands, we allow\neffectively for open or closed boundary conditions on the two strands. The error in doing so is\nto replace the true l\u03b3\u22121 by l\u2212c at the extremities of the chain. This simplification which affects\nonly the extremal segments of the two strands does not change the algorithmic complexity of\nthe recursion and the CPU time remains of order N 2 \u00d7 I 2 .\nAcknowledgements. \u2013 We thank E.
