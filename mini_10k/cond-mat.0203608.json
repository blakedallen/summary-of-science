[10] and,\nexplicitly, we assume a wire of circular symmetry about\nthe z-axis with constant potential, V (r, z) = 0 within a\nboundary r0 (z) from the symmetry axis and confining\npotential V0 > 0 elsewhere. This geometry is close to\nthat of narrow 'v'-groove quantum wires, which also exhibit anomalies near the conductance threshold [15]. To\nbe definite, we choose parameters appropriate to GaAs\nfor the wire and Alx Ga1\u2212x As for the barrier with x\nsuch that V0 = 0.4eV, which is close to the crossover\nto indirect gap. The wire width is taken as r0 (z) =\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2 a0 (1 + \u03be cos \u03c0z/a1 ) for |z| \u2264 2 a1 and r0 (z) \u2261 2 a0\notherwise, i.e., a wire of width a0 with a single bulge\nof length a1 and width (1 + \u03be)a0 , as shown in insets of\nFig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(c).\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the main properties of small confined electron\nsystems, intensively studied experimentally and theoretically in the last decade, is the electrical conductance.\nHowever, other transport coefficients also serve as a sensitive probe of new phenomena in such systems, such as the\nthermopower of chaotic quantum dots [1] or of atomic size\nmetallic contacts [2] and most recently, anomalies in onedimensional wires [3]. Theoretical investigations predict\nin these systems a range of new properties of transport\ncoefficients, such as anomalously enhanced thermopower\nin quantum dots due to the Kondo effect [4] and, at\nlow temperatures, changes in sign together with linear\nthermal conductance violating Wiedemann-Franz law [5].\nAnomalies in thermoelectric coefficients are also found\nin standard strongly correlated systems: the Anderson\nmodel [6], the Hubbard model [7] and the t-J model [8].\nIn this paper, we extend our recent theoretical study of\nconductance anomalies to include thermoelectric effects\ndue to a temperature gradient. Anomalies are related to\nweakly bound electron states within the quantum wire.\nIn particular, we consider a small fluctuation in thickness\nof the wire in some region giving rise to a weak bulge.\nIf this bulge is very weak then only a single electron will\nbe bound. We may thus regard this system as an 'open'\nquantum dot in which the bound electron inhibits the\ntransport of conduction electrons. Near the conduction\nthreshold, there is a 'Coulomb blockade' and we have\nshown that this gives rise to spin-dependent resonances,\nalso in an axial magnetic field, for wires of both rectangular [9] and cylindrical [10] cross-section.\nExperimentally, the staircase structure of the conductance of quantum wires was reported more than a\n\nII. CONDUCTANCE\n\nWe consider the interacting electron problem with the\nabove wire thickness variation in a range which ensures\nthat only one electron occupies a bound state and that\nrestriction to a single channel near the conduction edge\nis an excellent approximation. This is always the case for\na very weak smooth variation, i.e. a near perfect wire.\nFrom numerically exact solutions of the two-electron\nscattering problem, the conductance is calculated from\nour generalisation of the usual Landauer-B\u00fcttiker (LB)\nformula [16], to include spin-dependent scattering [17] of\nconduction electrons from the single electron bound in\nthe potential well. This gives G(\u03bc) = G0 T (\u03bc), where\n\n1\n\n\fG0 = 2e2 /h, \u03bc is the Fermi energy and the transmitivity\nis a weighted average over singlet and triplet channels\n[9,10,18],\nT (\u03bc) =\n\n3\n1\nTs (\u03bc) + Tt (\u03bc).\n4\n4\n\nwhere\nKn (\u03bc) = \u2212\n\n(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc)n\n\n1.50\n\nG/G0\n\nT=4.0 K\n\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n\nT=0.2 K\n\n(3e0/\u03c02k2BT)S (meV-1)\n\n0.00\n\n(b)\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(3h/2\u03c02k2BT)\u03ba\n\n1.50\n\n(c)\n\n1.25\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03bc (meV)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFIG. 1.

The traces for different T\nare offset vertically for clarity.\n\nIII. THERMOELECTRIC EFFECTS\n\nThe LB approach can be extended to include electrical and heat currents through a region between two\nleads with different temperatures and chemical potentials [19,20]. With T + \u2206T , \u03bc + eU for the left lead and\nT , \u03bc for the right lead, we get\nZ\n2e\n\u2206f (\u01eb)T (\u01eb)d\u01eb,\n(3)\nj=\nh\nZ\n2\njQ =\n(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc)\u2206f (\u01eb)T (\u01eb)d\u01eb,\n(4)\nh\n\nA. Thermopower\n\nThe Seebeck thermopower coefficient S measures the\nvoltage difference needed to neutralize the current due\nto the temperature difference between the leads. In the\nlinear response regime the thermopower is given by,\n\nand\n(5)\n\nS(\u03bc) =\nIn the linear response regime of vanishing \u2206T and U the\ncurrents simplify to\n\nU\n1 K1 (\u03bc)\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2206T\neT K0 (\u03bc)\n\n(9)\n\nas is for various systems discussed in Refs. [20,3]. Eq. 9 is\nformally the same as the Mott-Jones formula for simple\nmetals [21] and generalized for a system with stronger\nelectron-phonon interactions in Refs. [22].\n\n2\n\n2e\n\u2206T\n2e\nK0 (\u03bc)U + K1 (\u03bc)\n,\nh\nh\nT\n2\n\u2206T\n2e\n,\njQ = K1 (\u03bc)U + K2 (\u03bc)\nh\nh\nT\n\n(8)\n\n(a)\n\n1.25\n\nwhere f (\u01eb, \u03bc, T ) = (1 + exp[(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc)/kB T ])\u22121 is the usual\nFermi function which describes the thermal distribution\nof electrons in the leads. G(\u03bc) is shown in Fig. 1(a)\nand Fig. 2(a) for a wire with relatively small and a larger\nbulge, respectively. Here the energy is measured from the\nthreshold of the conductance. As discussed in Ref. [10],\nthe weak bulge in the wire is equivalent to a shallow potential well in a perfectly straight wire and if the length of\nthe bulge region is small, this effective potential well can\nonly accommodate one bound state with the consequence\nthat only a singlet resonance in G exists, as observed, for\nexample, in Ref. [15]. Conversely, if the bulge region\nis longer, both, singlet and triplet resonances contribute.\nFor even longer bulge regions with a very shallow effective\npotential well (near perfect wire), the singlet resonance is\npushed to lower energy and therefore becomes extremely\nnarrow. In this regime, only the broader triplet can be\nresolved at finite temperature [9,10], as observed experimentally in clean gated structures [12\u201314].\n\nj=\n\n\u2202f (\u01eb, \u03bc, T )\nT (\u01eb)d\u01eb.\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n(1)\n\nAt elevated temperatures we use the LB finite temperature extension\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n\u2202f (\u01eb, \u03bc, T )\n\u2212\nG(\u03bc) = G0\nT (\u01eb)d\u01eb,\n(2)\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n\u2206f (\u01eb) = f (\u01eb, \u03bc + eU, T + \u2206T ) \u2212 f (\u01eb, \u03bc, T ).\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n2\n\n\f1.50\n\nG/G0\n\nand up to temperatures where the structure is thermally\nsmeared out. This is shown in Fig. 3(a) where we present\na comparison of S(\u03bc) for the exact result with the approximations to first and second order. We see that at\nenergies below the resonance, both the linear and cubic approximations deviate significantly from the exact\nresult, Eq. 9. In this regime the conductance is itself\nvery small and hence G(\u03bc)\u22121 \u2202 n G(\u03bc)/\u2202\u03bcn is prone to error making calculations and experimental data analysis\nbased on this expansion unreliable.\nThe thermopower of one-dimensional wires has been\nmeasured [23,24] and more recently, further anomalies\nrelated to '0.7 anomaly' in conductance were reported\n[3]. The authors of Ref. [3] observe a dip in S(\u03bc) at energies corresponding to the anomaly in G(\u03bc). However,\nthe logarithmic derivative with respect to the gate voltage of the measured G exhibits a much deeper minimum\nthan the dip in the measured S(\u03bc), which remains well\nabove zero even at the lowest temperatures . This clearly\nshows that a simple non-interacting formula is not valid\nin this low temperature regime. Apart from the small\ncorrections to the logarithmic approximation to S, our\nmodel and its solution within the LB framework are\n\n(a)\n\n1.25\n\nT=4.0 K\n\n1.00\n0.75\n\nT=0.2 K\n\n0.50\n0.25\n\n(b)\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n(3h/2\u03c02k2BT)\u03ba\n\n1.50\n\n(c)\n\n1.25\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03bc (meV)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n(3e0/\u03c02k2BT)S (meV-1)\n\n(3e0/\u03c02k2BT)S (meV-1)\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\nFIG. 2. As Fig.1, but for longer bulge with parameters\na0 = 10 nm, a1 = 60 nm and \u03be = 0.1.\n\nIn Fig. 1(b) the thermopower of a narrow wire with\na small bulge is presented for the same range of temperatures as G(\u03bc). Such a result is expected, e.g., for\nthe system studied in Ref. [15]. The structure reflects\nthe singlet resonance observed in the conductance and is\nsmeared out at temperatures comparable with the width\nof the resonance. In a wire with small thickness variation,\nbut with a longer bulge, triplet resonance scattering also\nexists, as shown in Fig. 2. In the thermopower curve of\nFig. 2(b), the dominant structure at lower temperatures\ncomes from the singlet resonance, though the triplet resonance is still clearly discernible. At higher temperatures\nthe triplet structure is washed out first, in contrast to the\nconductance result, Fig. 2(a). At low temperatures only\nthe transmitivity at energies close to the chemical potential contributes to the above integrals and the general\nresult Eq. 9 can be related to the temperature dependent\nG(\u03bc) by the following expansion\n\u03c0 2 kB 2 T\nS(\u03bc) = \u2212\n3e\n\n\u0012\n\n8\n\n(a)\n\nT=2.0 K\n\n6\n\nexact\n3\nO(T )\nO(T)\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n(3h/2\u03c02k2BT)\u03ba\n\n1.00\n\n(b)\n\nT=2.0 K\n\n0.75\n\nexact\n3\nO(T )\nO(T)\n\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03bc (meV)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFIG. 3.

[3]. That is, the\ncalculated thermopower is in good agreement with experiment except at low temperatures where we also predict\na deep minimum. This discrepancy at low-temperatures\nmay well be a many-body Kondo-like effect contained\nwithin our model but not within the two-electron ap-\n\n(10)\nOur results were calculated using the exact relation Eq. 9.\nHowever, the leading term in Eq. 10, is a reasonable\napproximation for energies above the singlet resonance\n3\n\n\fand G \u223c 43 G0 is a spin effect, being a direct consequence\nof the singlet and triplet nature of the resonances. The\nprobability ratio 1:3 for singlet and triplet scattering follows directly from this and as such is a universal effect,\nnot only for conductance but all thermoelectric transport\ncoefficients. A comprehensive numerical investigation of\nopen quantum dots using a wide range of parameters\nshows that singlet resonances are always at lower energies than the triplets, in accordance with the Lieb-Mattis\ntheorem for bound states [27].\nThermopower plots show anomalies, related ultimately\nto the Coulomb interaction between a localised electron\nand the remaining conduction electrons. We have shown\nthat the lower-energy singlet anomalies in thermopower\nare more pronounced. These should be clearly observable in wires which show the corresponding conductance\nanomalies, such as the narrow 'hard confined' wires reported in Ref. [15], or in gated quantum wires under high\nsource-drain bias where the singlet anomaly is clearly observed [28].\nFinally we conclude by emphasising that although our\nmodel of a quantum wire with a weak bulge may appear\nrather specialised, it is actually quite general since the\nweak bulge is mathematically equivalent to a weak potential well in an otherwise perfect wire. As with our\nprevious work, we have not investigated in detail the actual causes of such weak effective (or real) potential wells\nbut point out that they may well be due to quite different\nsources in different experiments, e.g. thickness fluctuations, remote impurities or gates, electronic polarisation,\nor some other more subtle electron interaction effect. The\nmain point is that because the effective potential well is\nshallow, it will bind one and only one electron. The universal anomalies in conductance and thermopower are a\ndirect consequence of this and occur for a wide range of\ncircumstances in almost perfect quantum wires.\n\nproximation we have used here and in our earlier papers. We expect the two-electron approximation to break\ndown at low temperatures for which the underlying extended Hubbard model, which is the starting point of\nour approach, can be mapped onto a generalised Anderson model with coupling terms that are strongly energy\ndependent [25]. The standard results for the single impurity problem [6] cannot be applied directly to this effective model, which is the subject of current research [26].\nAt very low temperatures, a Kondo-like resonance is expected [5], for which many-body effects would dominate\nwith a breakdown of formula Eq. 9.\nB. Thermal conductance\n\nThe linear thermal conductance is the heat current divided by the temperature difference between the leads\nwhen the chemical potentials are adjusted to give no electrical current. From Eqs. 6-8 we see that this is related\nto T (\u01eb) by,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nK 2 (\u03bc)\n2\nK2 (\u03bc) \u2212 1\n.\n(11)\n\u03ba(\u03bc) =\nhT\nK0 (\u03bc)\nFor low temperatures this simplifies to Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw, first term in\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c0 2 kB\nT\nG(\u03bc)\n1+\n(12)\n\u03ba(\u03bc) =\n3e2\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0013\n2 2\n\u03c0 2 kB\nT\n8 \u2202 2 G(\u03bc)\n\u2202 ln G(\u03bc) \u00012\n+\n+ ...\n\u2212\n5\n15\nG(\u03bc) \u2202\u03bc2\n\u2202\u03bc\nIn Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(c) \u03ba(\u03bc) is shown for T from\n0.2K to 4K, calculated from Eq. 11. Comparison of\nFigs. 1(a),2(a) with Figs. 1(c),2(c) shows good agreement\nwith the Wiedemann-Franz law at lower temperatures\nbut there is increasing deviation at higher temperatures\nin the resonance region. For comparison, the dashed lines\nin Fig. 1(c), Fig. 2(c) show the corresponding linear approximation result, Eq. 12. This is also seen in the plot\nof \u03ba for T = 2K shown in Fig. 3(b). One of the most\nstriking features of these plots is that \u03ba(\u03bc), calculated\nfrom Eq. 11, exhibits an anomaly at higher energies than\nthe corresponding anomaly in conductance, a prediction\nwhich is open to experimental verification.\n\nV.
