It has something to do with very fundamental questions about quantum decoherence, nonequilibrium open\nsystems, etc. Recently, modern experiments using mesoscopic systems have opened the possibility of directly\nmeasuring and investigating these fundamental issues.\nAlso, it will provide key information for nanophysics and\nnanotechnology in the near future. It is difficult to consider the whole influence of the environment, and here\nwe concentrate on the dissipative behaviors, since they\nare typical characteristics of open systems.\nA method to derive the dissipative behavior from microscopic nondissipative theory was proposed by Caldeira\nand Leggett [1, 2]. Their model consists of two sorts of\ndegrees of freedom, the target system and the environment. The action is expressed as follows:\n\u001a\nZ\n1\nS[ q, {x\u03b1 }] =\ndt\nM q\u0307 2 \u2212 V0 (q)\n2\n\u0015\u001b\nX \u0014 1\n1\n+\nm\u03b1 \u1e8b2\u03b1 \u2212 m\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b12 x2\u03b1 \u2212 qC\u03b1 x\u03b1 , (1)\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\nwhere q(t) is the variable of the target system in a potential V0 (q), and x\u03b1 (t) are the harmonic oscillators representing the environmental degrees of freedom. The target\nsystem variable is coupled linearly to each oscillator with\nstrength C\u03b1 . If we set the parameters m\u03b1 , \u03c9\u03b1 (> 0), and\nC\u03b1 in an appropriate way, and eliminate the environmental variables with the proper boundary condition, a\ndissipative term (for example, the Ohmic dissipation q\u0307)\narises in the classical effective equation of motion of q(t).\nIn this article, we study the quantum mechanics of\nthis system by the Euclidean path integral over q(\u03c4 ) and\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: aoki@hep.s.kanazawa-u.ac.jp\naddress: horikosi@hep.s.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; Present address: Japan Science and Technology Corporation, and Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Nara Women's University,\nNara 630-8506, Japan; e-mail: horikosi@cc.nara-wu.ac.jp\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nx\u03b1 (\u03c4 ),\nZ =\n\nZ\n\nDq\n\nYZ\n\nDx\u03b1 e\u2212SE ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u001a\n\n1\nSE [ q, {x\u03b1 }] =\nd\u03c4\nM q\u0307 2 + V0 (q)\n2\n\u0015\u001b\nX \u0014 1\n1\n2\n2 2\n+\n.

However, the theoretical works so far (instanton, perturbation, etc.) depend on some expansions with respect to\nsmall parameters, which are not always valid.\nWe adopt the nonperturbative renormalization-group\n(NPRG) method [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] to\nanalyze the model. The formulation of the NPRG does\nnot require any series expansion. The NPRG method\nalso helps us to interpret the effects of \u2206S as effective infrared or ultraviolet cutoffs for the quantum fluctuation\nof the target system variable, and we readily understand\nthe dissipation effects as suppression or enhancement of\nthe quantum features of the effective target system. Furthermore, the NPRG method is in general very powerful\nfor studying the phase structure and critical phenomena. In dissipative quantum mechanics, a localization\n\n\f2\n(quantum-classical) transition has been suggested to occur, and it is investigated by the NPRG method in a\nstraightforward way to estimate the divergence of the localization susceptibility. We reported a NPRG analysis\nfor Ohmic dissipation in a brief form [19]. In this article\nwe describe the method in detail and treat general types\nof dissipation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we illustrate classical and quantum features of the CaldeiraLeggett model. In Sec. III we present our strategy to\napply the NPRG to quantum dissipative systems. The\nNPRG equation for dissipative quantum mechanics is derived and the effect of \u2206S is analyzed. In Sec. IV we solve\nthe NPRG equation in a double well potential system and\ncalculate the localization susceptibility to evaluate the\ncritical dissipation for the quantum-classical transition.\nSec. V contains a summary and discussion.\nII.\n\nTHE CALDEIRA-LEGGETT MODEL\nA.\n\nabsorbed by a local counterterm and hereafter we are\ninterested only in the dissipation effect.\nWe study general types of dissipation obtained by\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03b7 \u03c9 s (s = 1, 3, 5, ...), where cases of s > 1 are\ncalled super-Ohmic. Then the effective equation of motion is\nM q\u0308 = \u2212\n\n\u2202\nds q\nV0 \u2212 (\u22121)(s\u22121)/2 \u03b7 s ,\n\u2202q\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nwhere only the highest derivative term breaking the time\nreversal symmetry has been included. The origin of the\ntime reversal symmetry breaking is the boundary condition x\u03b1 (t = \u2212\u221e) = 0 for eliminating the variable x\u03b1 .\nNote that, in order to get a function J(\u03c9) that is exactly a simple polynomial in \u03c9, an infinite number of\ngapless oscillators x\u03b1 are required. This infinite number\nof oscillators is actually supplied by some field degrees\nof freedom (the electromagnetic field, the phonon field,\netc.).\n\nClassical equation of motion\nB.\n\nWe start with the classical features of the model and\nshow that the dissipative classical equation of motion\nis derived from the action (1). By eliminating the environmental variable x\u03b1 with the boundary condition\nx\u03b1 (t = \u2212\u221e) = 0, the equation of motion of q takes\nthe following form:\nZ \u221e\n\u2202V0\nd\u03c9 \u2212i\u03c9t\nM q\u0308 = \u2212\n\u2212\ne\nq\u0303(\u03c9)\n\u2202q\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\nX C2\n1\n\u03b1\n,\n\u00d7\nm\u03b1 (\u03c9 + i\u01eb)2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b12\n\u03b1\nZ \u221e\n\u2202V0\nd\u03c9 \u2212i\u03c9t\n=\u2212\n\u2212\ne\nq\u0303(\u03c9)\n\u2202q\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c9 \u2032\n4\u03c9 \u2032\n\u00d7\n, (6)\nJ(\u03c9 \u2032 )\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c9 + i\u01eb)2 \u2212 \u03c9 \u20322\n0\nwhere \u01eb is an infinitesimal positive regulator to assure\nthe boundary condition. We have introduced the spectral density function J(\u03c9) which characterizes the environment,\nJ(\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nC\u03b12\n(2\u03c0) \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1 ).\n4m\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nA suitable choice of J(\u03c9) generates dissipation. For example, if we set J(\u03c9) = \u03b7 \u03c9, then Eq. (6) reads\nM q\u0308 = \u2212\n\n\u2202 \u0010\n\u03b7\u03c9c 2 \u0011\nV0 \u2212\nq \u2212 \u03b7 q\u0307,\n\u2202q\n\u03c0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c9c is an ultraviolet cutoff of the environmental oscillator frequencies. The effects of the environment x\u03b1\nappear as the Ohmic dissipation term \u2212\u03b7 q\u0307 and the correction to the potential \u2212(\u03b7\u03c9c /\u03c0)q 2 . The latter can be\n\nDissipation term in the effective action\n\nIn the Euclidean path integral formulation of quantum\nmechanics, the correction term \u2206S due to the environment is defined in Eq. (5),\nZ\nZ\n\u2206S[q] = \u2212\nd\u03c4 ds q(\u03c4 ) \u03b1(\u03c4 \u2212 s) q(s), (10)\nwhere the nonlocal coupling coefficient is given by\n\u03b1(\u03c4 \u2212 s) =\n\nZ\n\ndE X C\u03b12\n1\neiE(\u03c4 \u2212s)\n2\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 2m\u03b1 E + \u03c9\u03b12\n\nX C2 1\n\u03b1\ne\u2212\u03c9\u03b1 |\u03c4 \u2212s|\n2m\n2\u03c9\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c9\nJ(\u03c9) e\u2212\u03c9|\u03c4 \u2212s| .\n=\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n=\n\n(11)\n\nGenerally \u2206S consists of the local component \u2206SL and\nthe genuine nonlocal component \u2206SNL . We identify\n\u2206SNL component as the dissipation term, since it corresponds to the odd power term in the Fourier transform,\nand thus it is related to time reversal symmetry breaking. On the other hand, we do not consider the \u2206SL\ncomponent supposing that they are renormalized to vanish with suitable counterterms. In fact they are all even\npower terms in the Fourier transform and are irrelevant\nto dissipation.\nFor example, in the case of Ohmic dissipation J(\u03c9) =\n\u03b7 \u03c9, we identify the dissipative part as follows:\nZ\n\u2206SL [q] = \u2212 \u03b1\u0303(E = 0) d\u03c4 q 2 (\u03c4 ),\n(12)\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n\u2206SNL [q] =\nd\u03c4 ds [q(\u03c4 ) \u2212 q(s)] \u03b1(\u03c4 \u2212 s), (13)\n2\n\n\f3\nwhere\n\nIII.\n\nX C2 1\n\u03b1\n2\n2m\n\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b1\n\u03b1\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u03b7\nd\u03c9\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03c9c ,\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\u03c0\nZ0 \u221e\nd\u03c9\n\u03b1(\u03c4 \u2212 s) =\n\u03b7 \u03c9 e\u2212\u03c9|\u03c4 \u2212s|\n2\u03c0\n0\n1\n\u03b7\n.\n=\n2\u03c0 |\u03c4 \u2212 s|2\n\nNPRG APPROACH FOR QUANTUM\nDISSIPATIVE SYSTEMS\n\n\u03b1\u0303(E = 0) =\n\nA.\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nIf we take the ultraviolet cutoff to be infinite, the local\ncomponent \u2206SL diverges.\nWe prepare the counterterm\nR\n\u2206SCT = \u2212\u2206SL = d\u03c4 (\u03b7\u03c9c /\u03c0)q 2 to remove it.

We study the influence of\n\u2206SNL on the quantum behaviors of q. Note that \u2206SNL\nis symmetric under time reversal, and we will not see any\nreal dissipating phenomena. As shown below, the effect\nof \u2206SNL modifies the propagator of q, and is interpreted\nas various cutoff effects in the NPRG point of view. Using the NPRG method we evaluate the effective potential (free energy) of the expectation value of the target\nsystem variable q, and calculate the localization susceptibility. We will evaluate the critical dissipation for the\nlocalization phase transition using the critical scaling behavior.\n\n2\n\nds\n\n[ q(\u03c4 ) \u2212 q(s) ]\n,\n|\u03c4 \u2212 s|2\n\n(16)\n\nwhich is considerably nonlocal. However, note that this\nterm never breaks time reversal symmetry. When evaluating the Euclidean path integral we do not use any\nspecific boundary condition for the integrated variables\nx\u03b1 . Therefore we should be careful when we call \u2206SNL\nthe \"dissipation term.\" It means that its classical effect\nis dissipative when the retarded boundary condition is\nemployed.\nThe Fourier transform of the Ohmic dissipation term\n\u2206SNL reads\nZ\ndE\n\u2206SNL [q] = \u2212\nq\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E)\n2\u03c0\n\u0013\nX C2 \u0012\n1\n1\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n\u00d7\n2m\u03b1 E 2 + \u03c9\u03b12\n\u03c9\u03b12\n\u03b1\nZ\ndE\n= \u2212\nq\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E)\n2\u03c0\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n1\nd\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\u00d7\nJ(\u03c9) 2\n2\u03c0\nE 2 + \u03c92\n\u03c9\n0\nZ\ndE\n=\nq\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E)\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03b7\nd\u03c9 2\n\u00d7 E2\n\u03c0\n\u03c9 + E2\n0\nZ\n1\ndE\n=\n\u03b7 |E| q\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E).\n(17)\n2\n2\u03c0\nAs a typical form of the \"dissipation term,\" the absolute value of E, |E|, appears.

The formulation of the NPRG\nmethod for standard (\u03b7 = 0) quantum mechanics is summarized as follows.\nIn the NPRG method, the theory is defined by the\nWilsonian effective action S\u039b [q]. This is an effective theory with an ultraviolet energy cutoff \u039b. Then we carry\nout a path integration over the highest energy degrees of\nfreedom of q\u0303(E), \u039b \u2212 \u2206\u039b < |E| \u2264 \u039b, called the \"shell\nmode.\" After the shell mode integration, we get a new effective theory denoted by S\u039b\u2212\u2206\u039b [q], which is a functional\nof lower energy modes only. This procedure is called the\nrenormalization transformation and it defines an iterative sequence of points in the theory space spanned by\nall possible functionals S[q]. By taking the continuous\ntransformation limit \u2206\u039b \u2192 0, we reach a (functional)\ndifferential equation called the NPRG equation,\n\u039b\n\n\u2202S\u039b [q]\n= \u03b2 [S\u039b [q]] ,\n\u2202\u039b\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the \u03b2 functional is explicitly given in the literature\n[14, 15]. This equation is equivalent to a set of infinitedimensional coupled ordinary differential equations, and\ndefines a flow line in the theory space. When we integrate\nthe equation to the infrared limit (\u039b = 0), we arrive at\nS\u039b=0 [q] which has the full quantum information of the\ntheory.\nAlthough the \u03b2 functional is obtained without any approximations, we have to make some approximations to\nsolve the NPRG equation. We define a sub theory space\nin the full theory space and project the full equation (19)\nonto the subspace, which defines a reduced equation on\n\n\f4\nthe subspace. As a subspace, we take the local potential\nspace spanned by actions of the following form:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 2\nq\u0307 + V\u039b (q) .\n(20)\nS\u039b [q] =\nd\u03c4\n2\n\nIn this subspace, the potential function V\u039b (q) defines a\ntheory, and our subspace is still an infinite-dimensional\nfunction space. Then the reduced renormalization transformation is given by\n\nV\u039b\u2212\u2206\u039b (q) = V\u039b (q)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n\u2202 2 V\u039b\ndE\n2\n, (21)\n+\nln E +\n2 shell 2\u03c0\n\u2202q 2\n\nwhere we path integrate the shell mode up to one-loop\norder. Taking the continuous limit \u2206\u039b \u2192 0, the oneloop evaluation becomes exact, and we obtain the reduced NPRG equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202V\u039b\n1\n1 \u2202 2 V\u039b\n\u039b\n.\n(22)\n= \u2212\n\u039b ln 1 + 2\n\u2202\u039b\n2\u03c0\n\u039b \u2202q 2\n\nWe will work with this equation, which is called the local\npotential approximated Wegner-Houghton (LPA W-H)\nequation [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Note that no perturbative expansion has been adopted to obtain Eq. (22). We\nmay improve the approximation by enlarging the sub theory space, and it is completely free of any sort of series\nexpansion and nonconvergence problems. Due to these\nfeatures, we expect that the NPRG method will work\nexcellently for the nonperturbative analysis of quantum\nsystems.\nThe target equation (22) is a partial differential equation of V\u039b with respect to q and \u039b. We solve it by lowering \u039b from the initial cutoff \u039b0 where the initial potential\nV\u039b0 is given by the potential term in the original quantum\naction, that is, V\u039b0 (q) = V0 (q). At the infrared limit, we\nget the effective potential Veff (q) = lim\u039b\u21920 V\u039b (q), from\nwhich physical quantities are evaluated. First, the expectation value of q in the ground state hqi is determined by\nthe stationary condition,\ndVeff\ndq\n\n= 0,\n\n(23)\n\nq=hqi\n\nand then the ground state energy is given by\nE0 = Veff (q = hqi).\n\n(24)\n\nAlso we obtain the energy gap of the system,\ns\nd2 Veff\n\u2206E \u2261 E1 \u2212 E0 = meff \u2261\ndq 2\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nq=hqi\n\nwhere m2eff is nothing but the curvature of the potential\nat the minimum [21].\nAs the initial potential V\u039b0 , we choose the double well\ntype, V\u039b0 = \u2212 21 m20 q 2 + \u03bb0 q 4 , throughout this article.\nWe work with the units ~ = M = 1 and measure all\ndimensionful quantities by m0 , that is, \u039b[m0 ], V\u039b [m0 ],\n\u22121/2\nq[m0 ], \u03bb0 [m30 ], etc. Hereafter we will omit the units\nfrom the numerical values.\n\nC.\n\nNPRG equation with dissipation\n\nWe derive the NPRG equation for quantum mechanics\nwith a dissipation term. We employ the local potential\napproximation as above. Then only the potential part\nof the action is changed by the renormalization transformation. We integrate out the shell mode up to one-loop\norder,\nZ\n1\ndE\nV\u039b\u2212\u2206\u039b (q) = V\u039b (q) +\n2 shell 2\u03c0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 2 V\u039b\n2\n(s\u22121)/2\ns\n\u00d7 ln E + (\u22121)\n\u03b7|E| +\n,(26)\n\u2202q 2\nwhere we have used the modified propagator due to the\n\u03b7 term.

Before proceeding to the numerical calculation, let\nus pay attention to the form of the propagator modified\nby the dissipation term and discuss the dissipation effect\nqualitatively. The inverse propagator \u2206\u22121 (E) consists of\nthree parts, the original part of the kinetic term Skin and\nthe mass term Smass , and the dissipation part \u2206SNL ,\nSkin [q] + Smass [q] + \u2206SNL [q]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 dE\n\u2202 2 V\u039b\n(s\u22121)/2\ns\n=\n+(\u22121)\n\u03b7\n|E|\nq\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E)\nE2 +\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u2202q 2\nZ\ndE \u22121\n1\n\u2206 (E) q\u0303 (E) q\u0303 (\u2212E).\n(28)\n=\n2\n2\u03c0\nFor the high energy region, the mass term can be neglected. For the low energy region, the mass term dominates and the NPRG equation effectively reduces to a\nfree form without interactions. Therefore when we qualitatively discuss the dissipation effects we can ignore the\nmass term.\nWe compare the propagator with the standard form\nwithout dissipation,\nf (E) \u2261 E 2 \u2206(E)\n=\n\nE2\n.\nE 2 + (\u22121)(s\u22121)/2 \u03b7 |E|s\n\n(29)\n\n\f5\n\n\u03b7=0\ns=1\ns=5\ns=9\n\nf(E)\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nE\n\n2.0\n\n[ m0 ]\n\n].\nFIG. 1: Cutoff factor f (E) for s = 1 + 4n with \u03b7 = 1[m2\u2212s\n0\n\n\u03b7=0\ns=3\ns=7\ns=11\n\nf(E)\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\nultraviolet cutoff. These cutoffs have their own typical\nenergy scales Ec = \u03b7 \u22121/(s\u22122) where f (E) = 12 .\nNext, we consider the cases of s = 3 + 4n super-Ohmic\ndissipation shown in Fig. 2. In these cases f (E) shows\nsingular behavior in that it diverges at the energy scale\nEc = \u03b7 \u22121/(s\u22122) . This means that the theory is normal\nonly below the ultraviolet cutoff energy Ec . In the normal region f (E) is larger than 1 and the propagation is\nenhanced.\nAs discussed above, \u2206SNL acts as various types of effective cutoffs, which suppress or enhance the quantum\nfluctuation in energy dependent ways.\nThe NPRG method we employ now is a method to\ndivide the variables q(\u03c4 ) into energy shell modes, and\nto evaluate the quantum fluctuation of each shell mode\nsystematically from the higher energy modes. It is suitable for studying the energy dependent cutoff effect appearing in dissipative quantum mechanics. Through the\nNPRG analysis of ordinary (\u03b7 = 0) quantum mechanics, we know that the effective energy region where the\nquantum fluctuations are significant depends on the mass\nscale of the theory [16]. This fact implies that, if the cutoff effect originating from the dissipative term \u2206SNL is\nlarge in this effective energy region, it may modify the\nphase structure of the system. In this way, the NPRG\nmethod allows us to understand intuitively the effect of\n\u2206SNL as an effective energy dependent cutoff and discuss\nits strength by comparing it with the effective energy region of the original system. Such a viewpoint is a unique\nadvantage of the NPRG approach.\n\nIV.\n\nANALYSIS OF DISSIPATIVE QUANTUM\nTUNNELING\nA.\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nE\n\n2.0\n\n[ m0 ]\n\n].\nFIG. 2: Cutoff factor f (E) for s = 3 + 4n with \u03b7 = 1[m2\u2212s\n0\n\nSome typical forms of f (E) are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.\n2 with \u03b7 = 1. The effects of the dissipation term \u2206SNL\ncan be interpreted as cutoff effects and are classified into\nthree groups.\nFor s = 1 Ohmic dissipation, since f (E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 0\nand f (E) \u2192 1 as E \u2192 \u221e, the dissipation term \u2206SNL\nsuppresses the propagation in the E \u2192 0 region, that\nis, it is equivalent to an effective infrared cutoff. On the\nother hand, for s = 1 + 4n super-Ohmic dissipation, the\npropagation is suppressed in the E \u2192 \u221e region, and\nthe dissipation term \u2206SNL is equivalent to an effective\n\nMacroscopic quantum coherence\n\nThe Caldeira-Leggett model consists of two classes of\nvariables, the target system q and the environmental degrees of freedom {x\u03b1 }. We regard the system variable q\nas a macroscopic collective coordinate and discuss how\nthe quantum mechanical behavior of the macroscopic\ncoordinate q is affected by the environmental effects.\nAs a typical phenomenon, the quantum tunneling of q\nhas been analyzed by many authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nWe set the bare potential of q as the double well type,\nV0 (q) = \u2212 21 q 2 + \u03bb0 q 4 . In this system with vanishing \u03b7\nthe q mode tunnels through the potential barrier and\noscillates between the two wells. The main question is\nwhether or not it also oscillates even in the \u03b7 6= 0 dissipative system. Such an oscillatory behavior is called\nmacroscopic quantum coherence and the inclination to\ncease the oscillation corresponds to decoherence [8].\nNow we briefly summarize the previous results obtained for macroscopic quantum coherence in double\nwell potential systems with various types of dissipation\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03b7 \u03c9 s . Usually the first energy gap \u2206E = E1 \u2212 E0\nis calculated as the physical quantity because it corre-\n\n\fB.\n\nV\u039b(q)\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nq\n\n2.0\n\n[ m0\n\n-1/2\n\n]\n\n2\n\n[ m0 ]\n\nFIG. 3: Flow of the potential for \u03bb0 = 0.1[m30 ].\n\n\u03b7=0\n\u03b7=10\n\u03b7=20\n\u03b7=40\n\n2.0\n\n2\n\n1.0\n\nm\u039b\n\nsponds to the tunneling amplitude between the two wells.\nFor s = 1 Ohmic dissipation, Caldeira and Leggett evaluated it by using the semi-classical (instanton) approximation, which is valid for \u03bb0 \u2192 0 and perturbation with\nrespect to \u03b7, and they found that the dissipation \u2206S\nsuppresses the tunneling [1, 2]. Renormalization-group\nanalyses have been done for the instanton gas system\nwithin the dilute gas approximation, which is also valid\nfor \u03bb0 \u2192 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 0 [5, 6]. They predict the remarkable phenomenon that \u2206E vanishes at a critical value\n\u03b7c = 2\u03c0\u03bb0 , where decoherence occurs. This is often called\nthe quantum-classical transition because the system looks\nclassical in the limited sense that quantum tunneling does\nnot occur. This is nothing but the spontaneous Z2 symmetry breaking. The energy gap \u2206E plays an important\nrole as the order parameter of the transition.\nOn the other hand, for s = 3 super-Ohmic dissipation,\nthe possible enhancement of \u2206E is shown by perturbative\ncalculus with respect to \u03b7 in the canonical formulation\n[3, 4]. This result is interpreted as the effect of the higher\nexcited states (En , n \u2265 2), and it cannot be reproduced\nby the standard instanton calculus. For the cases of s =\n5, 7, 9, ... super-Ohmic dissipation, no detailed analyses\nhave been carried out. The dissipation effects in these\ncases are expected to be weak by simple power counting,\nsince they are irrelevant in the infrared region.\nThese results we listed above are obtained by using\nthe semiclassical approximation and/or perturbation theory with respect to \u03b7. Their reliability depend on the\nsmallness of the couplings \u03bb0 and \u03b7. Therefore, to get\nmore general and reliable results free of this limitation,\nwe must employ an analyzing tool which does not need\na series expansion with respect to any couplings. We\nexpect our method of using the NPRG will work best,\nparticularly for the large coupling region.\n\n[ m0 ]\n\n6\n\n0.0\n\nNPRG analysis\n-1.0\n\nWe analyze dissipative quantum tunneling by solving\nthe NPRG equation (27) numerically. This equation is\na two-dimensional partial differential equation for the\nWilsonian effective potential V\u039b (q) with respect to \u039b and\nq. The initial condition of the potential is the bare potential V\u039b0 (q) = \u2212 21 q 2 + \u03bb0 q 4 at the initial cutoff \u039b0 .\nWe solve the differential equation in the infrared limit\n\u039b \u2192 0 and obtain the physical effective potential Veff (q).\nThe typical change of the potential toward the infrared\nis shown in Fig. 3. We see two basic features of the flow.\nThe potential at the origin moves up, which finally gives\nthe ground state energy of the zero point oscillation. The\nsecond derivative of the potential at the origin also increases from negative to positive, changing the potential\nform from a double well to a single well.\nWe note here the actual treatment of the infrared and\nthe ultraviolet limit in the numerical calculation.

Therefore before lowering the\nscale \u039b to vanishing, we get the infrared limit results. As\nfor the initial cutoff, it should be infinite since the target system is quantum mechanics without an ultraviolet\nenergy cutoff. We start with a large value of the initial\ncutoff to solve the equation, and check that the physical\nresults given by the infrared potential change little when\nwe move the initial cutoff up further.

In\nthis sense semiclassical arguments depending on the long\nrange transition amplitude seem doubtful for the purpose\nof investigating the localization transition.\nHere, instead of analyzing the long range correlator, we\nadopt another physical quantity to describe the possible\nquantum-classical transition, the localization susceptibility. We suppose that a source term J that couples to the\nzero mode of q\u0303(E),\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206E=meff\n\nWe can exploit the physical information of the quantum system from Veff (q). First of all, the mass squared\nstarting with a negative value (\u22121) finally reaches a positive value (for small \u03b7), m2eff > 0, that is, the effective\npotential Veff (q) becomes a single well form. The running\nof the mass squared is plotted in Fig. 4 for \u03bb0 = 1.0.\nThis means that, due to the quantum tunneling, the Z2\nsymmetry (parity) does not break spontaneously, and the\nexpectation value of q vanishes. The tunneling effects are\nautomatically incorporated when we integrate (solve) the\nNPRG equation toward the infrared.\nWhen the dissipation effects are included, the quantum\npropagator may be suppressed, and then such running of\nm2\u039b as shown in Fig. 4 is also suppressed. If the running is\nnot enough, the mass squared may not become positive\neven at the infrared limit. This indicates spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, and localization should be observed.\nFor nonvanishing \u03b7, the correspondence between the\nenergy gap \u2206E and the effective mass meff Eq. (25)\ndoes not hold. The long range (\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e) behavior of the\ntwo point function\nZ\ndE iE\u03c4\n1\nlim\ne\n(30)\n2\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0\nE + \u03b7|E| + m2eff\n\n[ m0 ]\n\n7\n\n=\n\n1\n.\nm2eff\n\n(33)\n\nThese definitions are valid also for nonvanishing \u03b7. If we\nfind a divergent and scaled behavior of \u03c7 toward \u03b7 = \u03b7c ,\n\nwe may conclude that the localization transition occurs\nat \u03b7c and it is a second order phase transition.\nThe results for s = 1 Ohmic dissipation are shown in\nFig. 5 for several \u03bb0 . In previous works [16, 17, 18] for\nthe \u03b7 = 0 system, the NPRG analyses have been found\nto work excellently in these \u03bb0 regions while the dilute\ngas instanton approximation does not work at all there.\nIn Fig. 6 we recapitulate the results for the energy gap\nwith \u03b7 = 0 where those by the dilute gas instanton are\nalso plotted for comparison and the exact values are calculated by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We see that\n\n\f8\nthe effective infrared cutoff Ec = \u03b7. Therefore a larger\n\u03b7 causes a stronger cutoff effect and results in a smaller\nmeff . For larger \u03bb0 , the system mass scale is larger, and\ntherefore a larger \u03b7 is required to effectively cut off the\nquantum fluctuation. These behaviors are qualitatively\nconsistent with those of \u2206E obtained by the instanton\napproximation.\nThen, what happens for larger \u03b7? The expected phenomenon is the quantum-classical transition characterized by complete disappearance of the tunneling. The\nNPRG method may not work precisely in the meff \u2192 0\nregion because Eq. (27) becomes singular there and the\nnumerical error increases. Therefore according to the\nstandard technique of analyzing critical phenomena, we\nevaluate the critical dissipation \u03b7c from the diverging behavior of the localization susceptibility. We fit \u03c7(\u03b7) with\nthe critical exponent form\n\n15.0\n\n-2\n\nln (\u03c7/m0 )\n\n10.0\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n\n-5.0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nln [(\u03b7c-\u03b7)/m0]\n\n\u03c7 = C|\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c |\u2212\u03b3 .\n\n[ m0 ]\n\nFIG. 7: Critical scaling fit of localization susceptibility \u03c7 for\n\u03bb0 = 1.0[m30 ].\n\n120\n\n8.0\n\u03b7c instanton\n\u03b7c NPRG\n\u03b3 NPRG\n\n100\n\n6.0\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b7c\n\n80\n60\n40\n\n4.0\n\n20\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n\u03bb0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n3\n\n[ m0 ]\n\nFIG. 8: \u03bb0 dependence of critical dissipation \u03b7c and critical\nexponent \u03b3.\n\nfor the large \u03bb0 region (\u03bb0 >\n\u223c 0.1) the NPRG results looks\nexcellent while the instanton method is out of its effective\nrange just as is expected. Therefore we expect that the\nNPRG analysis also works well for these \u03bb0 values even\nin \u03b7 6= 0 systems.\nWe find that for every value of \u03bb0 meff decreases as \u03b7\nbecomes large (Fig. 5). This \u03b7 and \u03bb0 dependence of meff\nis readily understandable by using the property of the\ncutoff interpretation of the Ohmic dissipation. Remember that the quantum fluctuation of q is suppressed below\n\n(34)\n\nWe show an example of fit for \u03bb0 = 1.0 in Fig. 7. We\nconclude that the localization susceptibility shows divergent behavior with a power scaling, which indicates a\nsecond order phase transition of localization, often called\nthe quantum-classical transition.\nWe obtain the critical dissipation \u03b7c and the critical exponent \u03b3 for these \u03bb0 , which are plotted in Fig. 8. The\nprevious analysis using the dilute gas instanton gives a\nsimple relation \u03b7c = 2\u03c0\u03bb0 which is also shown in Fig. 8\nfor comparison. The NPRG results for \u03b7c are systematically large compared to those of the instanton. As for the\ncritical exponent \u03b3, we observe the universality property\nexcept for the smallest \u03bb0 = 0.1, where NPRG results\nmay not be reliable.\nNext we see the difference among various dissipation\neffects at s = 1, 3, 5. The results for \u03bb0 = 0.4 are shown\nin Fig. 9 (for small \u03b7) and Fig. 10 (for large \u03b7). For\nsmall \u03b7, suppression (s = 1, 5) and enhancement (s=3)\nof quantum fluctuations are seen as we expect. Note that\nfor the s = 3 case, since the hard ultraviolet cutoff Ec =\n1/\u03b7 exists, the theory is an effective theory defined only\nbelow the energy scale Ec = 1/\u03b7. Here we use the bare\ncutoff \u039b0 = 100, and the s = 3 result can be obtained\nonly in the region 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 0.01. If the system is analyzed\nperturbatively (\u03b7 \u2192 0), such a hard cutoff problem is not\nrecognized [3, 4].\nLet us compare the super-Ohmic (s = 5) case with the\nOhmic case. Both cases suppress the quantum fluctuation and the relative strength of the effects depends on\n\u03b7, which turns over at \u03b7 \u223c 3.0 as seen in Fig. 10. This\nturnover is explained by comparing the effective cutoff\nscale due to dissipation Ec = \u03b7 \u22121/(s\u22122) with the original\nmass scale of the system determined by m0 and \u03bb0 .\nHow about the possibility of the quantum-classical\ntransition with super-Ohmic dissipation (s = 5, 9, ...)?\nContrary to the Ohmic case, the dissipation effect corresponds to the effective ultraviolet cutoff with scale\nEc = \u03b7 \u22121/(s\u22122) . Taking account of the basic notion that\nthe infrared energy region is most significant for the local-\n\n\f[ m0 ]\n\n9\nization transition, we may conclude that it is impossible\nfor super-Ohmic dissipation to suppress quantum tunneling completely. This was expected from naive power\ncounting, that is, the super-Ohmic dissipation is irrelevant in the infrared region.\n\n1.00\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\n0.95\n\nmeff\n\ns=1 : Ohmic\ns=3 : Super Ohmic\ns=5 : Super Ohmic\n\nWe analyzed the Caldeira-Leggett model by the nonperturbative renormalization-group method. We derived\nthe NPRG equation with a dissipation term characterized\nby J(\u03c9) = \u03b7\u03c9 s within the local potential approximation.\nThis method enables us to regard dissipation effects as\nvarious cutoff effects that enhance or suppress the quantum fluctuations of the system.\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n0.000\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n\u03b7/m0\n\n0.006\n\n2-s\n\n0.008\n\n0.010\n\n[ m0 ]\n\nFIG. 9: Dissipation dependence of meff for \u03bb0 = 0.4[m30 ] with\ninitial cutoff \u039b0 = 100[m0 ] in the small \u03b7 region. We divide\n\u03b7 by m2\u2212s\nin order to make it dimensionless.\n0\n\nIn this article we did not consider the origin of the\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. It is very interesting\nto regard some higher dimensional fields as an environment coupled to quantum mechanical particles and to\nstudy how to treat such a complex system by the NPRG\nmethod. Furthermore, it not clear how to discriminate\nor construct the target macroscopic collective coordinate\namong the microscopic degrees of freedom. The NPRG\nmethod best fits the purpose of identifying the macroscopic effective theory for slow motion by averaging the\nquantum fluctuations.\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nmeff\n\nWe applied the NPRG equation to analysis of macroscopic quantum coherence and investigated the quantumclassical transition due to dissipation. For Ohmic dissipation, we observed that the localization susceptibility \u03c7\ndiverges toward \u03b7 = \u03b7c (\u03bb0 ) with critical scaling, and we\nconcluded that \u03b7c (\u03bb0 ) is the critical dissipation for the\nquantum-classical transition. There must remain, however, many fundamental and subtle problems to be studied about the notion of the quantum-classical transition\nand critical dissipation.\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\ns=1 : Ohmic\ns=5 : Super Ohmic\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nAcknowledgments\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\u03b7/m0\n\n2-s\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\nFIG. 10: Dissipation dependence of meff for \u03bb0 = 0.4[m30 ]\nwith initial cutoff \u039b0 = 100[m0 ] in the large \u03b7 region.\n\nWe would like to thank I.
