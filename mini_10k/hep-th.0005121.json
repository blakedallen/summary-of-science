This Universe consists of a five\u2013dimensional\nbulk space which is bounded by two four\u2013dimensional BPS three\u2013branes, one at one end of\nthe fifth dimension and one at the other. One of these branes contains observed matter, such\nas quarks and leptons, as well as their gauge interactions, either as a grand unified theory\nor as the standard model. This is called the \"observable sector\". The other brane can be\nchosen to contain pure gauge fields and their associated gauginos. Gaugino condensates on\nthis brane may provide a source of supersymmetry breaking in the theory. This brane is\ncalled the \"hidden sector\".\nAs discussed in [3, 5, 6], the E8 gauge group of Hor\u01ceva\u2013Witten theory can be spontaneously broken to a GUT group or the standard model gauge group on the observable brane\nby the appearance of a semi\u2013stable holomorphic vector bundle with structure group G on\nthe associated Calabi\u2013Yau threefold. This bundle acts as a non\u2013zero vacuum expectation\nvalue, breaking the E8 gauge group to the commutant H of G. Commutant H acts as the\ngauge group on the observable brane. The physical requirements that H be a realistic GUT\nor standard model gauge group, that the theory be anomaly free and that there be three\nfamilies of quarks and leptons, puts strong constraints on the allowed vector bundle. In general, there will be a solution if and only if one further requires the appearance of five\u2013branes,\nwrapped on holomorphic curves in the associated Calabi\u2013Yau threefold, located in the bulk\nspace.\nAs shown in [3, 5, 6], the exact structure of the holomorphic curve on which these bulk\nfive\u2013branes are wrapped can be computed from the anomaly cancellation condition. In this\npaper, we will take the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold, X, to be an elliptic fibration over a base\nsurface, B. In this case, it was shown in [3, 5, 6] that the holomorphic curve on which\nthe bulk five\u2013branes wrap generically has both a base and a fiber component. However, as\ndiscussed in [5, 7], there are always regions of the associated moduli space where such a curve\ndecomposes into independent curves, at least one of which is a pure fiber. We denote this\npure fiber by C2 . When wrapped on this component, the manifold of a five\u2013brane is of the\nform C2 \u00d7 M4 . As is well known, as long as the elliptic fiber is smooth, the M4 worldvolume\nspectrum consists of an N = 4 Abelian vector supermultiplet, which is broken to an N = 1\nAbelian vector supermultiplet plus uncharged chiral supermultiplets by higher dimensional\n1\n\n\foperators in the effective theory.\nHowever, not all fibers of an elliptic fibration are smooth. There are a number of ways,\nclassified by Kodaira [10], in which the associated torii can degenerate. The locus of all points\nin the base B over which the fiber is degenerate forms a divisor, called the discriminant curve.\nThe structure of this discriminant curve depends on the precise theory one is considering\nand, in general, can be quite intricate. This curve generically has smooth sections, cusps,\nand both normal and more complicated intersections. The Kodaira type of degeneration of\nthe fiber can change substantially from place to place over the discriminant curve. If we\nchoose some point on the discriminant locus, and wrap the five\u2013brane over the associated\ndegenerate elliptic fiber, then new physics emerges. If the point chosen is in a smooth part of\nthe curve, then the worldvolume theory on M4 has N = 2 supersymmetry at low energy. If\none chooses the point at a singular locus of the discriminant curve, then the supersymmetry\nat low energies may be further reduced to N = 1. In either case, new, massless states emerge,\nin addition to the \"standard\" worldvolume multiplets mentioned above. These new states\narise from the fluctuations of M membranes stretching between the vanishing cycles of the\ntorus. As the cycles go to zero, massless states emerge.\nThe purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we present, for specificity, a quasi\u2013realistic,\nthree\u2013family SU(5) grand unified theory within the context of Heterotic M-Theory. This\ntheory corresponds to an explicit semi\u2013stable holomorphic vector bundle with structure group\nG = SU(5) over an elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with base B = F\u03023 . We discuss\nthe bulk five\u2013branes and compute the class of the holomorphic curve over which they are\nwrapped. The moduli space of this class is then presented and it is shown that a region of\nthis space corresponds to a single five\u2013brane wrapped on a pure elliptic fiber C2 . This work is\npresented in Section 2. In Section 3, we give the general theory for explicitly computing the\ndiscriminant curves of elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. We apply these methods\nto determine the discriminant curves associated with the specific Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with\nbase B = F\u03023 presented in Section 2. We show that there are several possible curves, each\nwith smooth sections, cusps, and normal and tangential self\u2013intersections. We compute the\nKodaira type fiber degeneracy over all points of the discriminant curve. In the following\nsection, Section 4, we explicitly compute the M4 worldvolume BPS states that arise when\na five\u2013brane is wrapped on the degenerate fibers over the smooth parts of the discriminant\ncurves. This reduces the problem from one of two complex moduli to one modulus, and allows\nthe application of standard Kodaira theory. Using the theory of string junctions developed\nin [26, 27], we present the spectrum of BPS states, and the associated N = 2 hyper- and\n2\n\n\fvector multiplets, for fibers of each Kodaira type occuring in the explicit theory of Section 2.\nThe computation of light states over cusps and points of self\u2013intersection, being inherently\nmore intricate, will be presented in future publications [11] . Finally, in the Appendix, we\noutline those aspects of string junction theory necessary for the calculations in this paper.\nOne can only speculate at this point about the possible physical role of the BPS multiplets\nthat arise in this manner. They will appear in the brane world scenario as \"exotic\" charged\nmatter living on the worldvolumes of hidden sector three\u2013branes. These new multiplets\ncould be involved in new mechanisms of supersymmetry breakdown [4], might be relevant to\ncosmology [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], such as the dark matter in the Universe and so on. We will\nreturn to these issues elsewhere.\n\n2\n\nA Three Generation GUT Theory:\n\nIn this section, we will construct a quasi\u2013realistic particle physics theory with three generations of quarks and leptons and a grand unified gauge group SU(5). This is carried out\nwithin the framework of Heterotic M\u2013Theory compactified on an elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013\nYau threefold X. The requirement that X be a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold means that c1 (T X) = 0,\nwhich, in turn, implies that the base B of the elliptic fibration is restricted to be a del Pezzo\nsurface dPi , a Hirzebruch surface Fr , an Enriques surface E or certain \"blown\u2013up\" Fr surfaces.\nFor specificity, in this paper we will consider Calabi\u2013Yau spaces with the base restricted to\nbe of the latter type, that is, a blown\u2013up Hirzebruch surface. As will become clear in the\nnext section, we make this choice because elliptic fibrations over such a base have non\u2013trivial\ndiscriminant curves involving not only different Kodaira type fibers, but also both normal\nand tangential crossing points. Again, for concreteness we will construct a model over a\nspecific blown\u2013up Hirzebruch surface, although our results apply generally.\nConsider the Hirzebruch surface F3 . This is a ruled surface which is a natural fibration\nof F3 \u2212\u2192 CP1 . We denote the fiber class of this fibration by E. This class has vanishing\nself\u2013intersection. In addition, there is a unique curve of self\u2013intersection \u22123 which we denote\nby S. These two classes have a single point of intersection since E * S = 1. We now modify\nthis surface by blowing up a point on the curve E which is not the point of intersection. The\nblow\u2013up at that point introduces a new exceptional class, which we denote as G. This is the\nsurface that we will use as the base of our elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold and we\n3\n\n\fdenote it by\nB = F\u03023\n\n(2.1)\n\nIt is convenient to introduce F , where F + G = E. The three classes S, F and G are each\neffective classes and together they form a basis of H2 (F\u03023 , Z). Furthermore, they generate the\nMori cone of effective classes. The intersection numbers of these three classes are given by\nS * S = \u22123,\n\nF * F = \u22121,\n\nG * G = \u22121\n\n(2.2)\n\nand\nS * F = 1,\n\nS * G = 0,\n\nG*F =1\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe first and second Chern classes of F\u03023 can be written as\nc1 (F\u03023 ) = 2S + 5F + 4G,\n\nc2 (F\u03023 ) = 5\n\n(2.4)\n\nrespectively. Having specified the Chern classes of the base, we note that the Chern classes\nof the tangent bundle, T X of X can now be computed. Since X is a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold,\nc1 (T X) = 0. However, c2 (T X) and c3 (T X) are found to be non-vanishing functions of c1 (F\u03023 )\nand c2 (F\u03023 ). The exact expression for c2 (T X) is given in [3, 17, 18, 19].\nWe now want to specify a stable, holomorphic SU(n) vector bundle over the elliptically\nfibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold X with B = F\u03023 . For specificity, we will demand that the grand\nunification group be given by\nH = SU(5)\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhich then requires that we choose the structure group of the vector bundle to be\nG = SU(5)\n\n(2.6)\n\nHence, n = 5. Having chosen n, the class of the spectral cover C of the vector bundle is given\nby specifying a curve \u03b7 in the base B = F\u03023 . This curve must be effective to ensure that the\nspectral cover is effective, as it must be. In addition, \u03b7 must be an irreducible curve so that\nthe associated vector bundle will be stable. Since S, F and G are a basis of H2 (F\u03023 , Z), we\ncan always write\n\u03b7 = aS + bF + cG\n4\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fwhere a, b and c are integers. Recalling that the classes S, F and G generate the Mori cone,\nit follows that the condition for \u03b7 to be an effective class is simply that\na \u2265 0,\n\nb \u2265 0,\n\nc\u22650\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe conditions for the irreducibility of \u03b7 are a little more intricate to derive. Here we simply\nstate the result, which is that either\na 6= 0,\n\nb 6= 0,\n\nb=c=0\n\na=c=0\n\nc 6= 0,\n\na=b=0\n\n(2.9)\n\nor\nb \u2265 a,\n\nb \u2265 c,\n\na\u2265b\u2212c\n\n(2.10)\n\nHaving chosen the spectral cover C by giving n and \u03b7, it is now necessary to specify the\nspectral line bundle N over C. Generically, the allowed line bundles are indexed by a rational\nnumber \u03bb. For n odd, which is the case in our theory, this parameter must satisfy \u03bb \u2208 Z + 12 .\nFor specificity, we will choose\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n2\n\n(2.11)\n\nHaving specified C and N subject to the above conditions, a stable, holomorphic SU(5)\nvector bundle V can be constructed using the Fourier\u2013Mukai transformation\n(C, N ) \u2212\u2192 V\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe need not discuss V here, other than to say that its properties can be calculated from the\nabove data. In particular, in addition to its vanishing first Chern class, c1 (V ) = 0, the second\nand third Chern classes, c2 (V ) and c3 (V ) respectively, can be computed and are found to be\nfunctions of n, \u03b7 and \u03bb. The exact expressions are given in [3, 17, 18, 19].\nAs discussed in [3], the physical requirement that the theory be anomaly free leads to\nthe topological expression\nW = c2 (T X) \u2212 c2 (V )\n\n(2.13)\n\nW is a class that is interpreted as being a holomorphic curve in the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold\nX on which five\u2013branes, located in the five\u2013dimensional bulk space, are wrapped. Using the\nexact expressions for c2 (T X) and c2 (V ), we can compute this five\u2013brane class explicitly. We\nfind that\nW = WB \u03c3 + af F\n5\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fwhere \u03c3 is the class of the zero section of the elliptic fibration X and F is the generic class\nof its fiber. Furthermore,\nWB = 12c1 (B) \u2212 \u03b7\n\n(2.15)\n\nand\naf = c2 (B) + (11 +\n\nn3 \u2212 n\n3n 2 1\n)c1 (B)2 \u2212\n(\u03bb \u2212 )\n24\n2\u03bb\n4\n\n(2.16)\n\nFor the above specific theory, both WB and af can be computed and are given by\nWB = (24 \u2212 a)S + (60 \u2212 b)F + (48 \u2212 c)G\n\n(2.17)\n\naf = 117\n\n(2.18)\n\nand\n\nrespectively, where we have used equations (2.4), (2.7) and (2.11), as well as n = 5, \u03bb =\n\n1\n2\n\nand equations (2.2), (2.3). As discussed in [3], the class W is further constrained by the\nrequirement that it be an effective class in H2 (X, Z). It was shown that this will be the\ncase if and only if WB is an effective class in H2 (F\u03023 , Z) and af is a non\u2013negative integer. It\nfollows from (2.18) that the last condition is satisfied. We see from equation (2.17) that WB\nand, therefore, W will be an effective curve if and only if\n24 \u2265 a,\n\n60 \u2265 b,\n\n48 \u2265 c\n\n(2.19)\n\nIn addition to the anomaly cancellation condition (2.13), there is another property required\nof any realistic theory of particle physics, that is, that the number of quark and lepton\ngenerations be 3. As discussed in [3, 18], the number of quark and lepton generations is\ngiven by Ngen =\n\nc3 (V )\n.\n2\n\nUsing the expression for c3 (V ), it was shown that the three family\n\ncondition imposes the further constraint that\n\u03bb(WB2 \u2212 (24 \u2212 n)WB * c1 (B) + 12(12 \u2212 n)c1 (B)2 ) = 3\n\n(2.20)\n\nFor the above specific theory, using equations (2.4) and (2.17), as well as n = 5 and the\nintersections in (2.2), (2.3), this condition becomes\n\u22123a2 + 2ab \u2212 b2 + 2bc \u2212 c2 + 5(a \u2212 b \u2212 c) = 6\n\n(2.21)\n\nTherefore, to get a realistic SU(5) grand unified theory with three families of quarks and\nleptons for elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds with base B = F\u03023 , we must find a\n6\n\n\fcurve \u03b7 of form (2.7) that satisfies the conditions (2.8),(2.9) or (2.10), (2.19) and (2.21)\nsimultaneously.\nThe solution of these constraints is not entirely trivial. For the purposes of this paper,\nwe will only give the simplest solution. We find that it is impossible to find any solutions\nfor curves \u03b7 satisfying the conditions in equation (2.9). We must, therefore, impose equation\n(2.10). As an ansatz, we try for solutions with a 6= 0 and b = c 6= 0. Under these conditions,\nwe find a solution with\na = 6,\n\nb = c = 42\n\n(2.22)\n\n\u03b7 = 6S + 42F + 42G\n\n(2.23)\n\ncorresponding to the curve\n\nand the five\u2013brane class W = WB \u03c3 + 117F , where\nWB = 18S + 18F + 6G\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe bulk space five\u2013branes of this specific theory, described by the class W = WB \u03c3 + 117F\nwith WB given in (2.24), are the objects of interest in this paper.\nTo analyze the physical structure of these five\u2013branes, it is useful to first construct their\nmoduli space. The moduli spaces of M-theory five\u2013branes wrapped on holomorphic curves\nin elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds were constructed in [5]. Here, we will simply\napply the results of [5] to the specific theory discussed above. We find that the moduli space\nof these five\u2013branes is given by\nM(WB \u03c3 + 117F ) =\n\n117\n[\n\nM0 (WB \u03c3 + nF ) \u00d7 M((117 \u2212 n)F )\n\n(2.25)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere WB is given in (2.24) and\nM((117 \u2212 n)F ) = (F\u03023 \u00d7 CP1a )117\u2212n /Z117\u2212n\n\n(2.26)\n\nCP1a is the moduli space of the translation/axion multiplet associated with the fifth direction\nof the bulk space. The components M0 (WB \u03c3+nF ) of the moduli space can also be explicitly\ncomputed. This construction was presented in [5], where specific examples were given. It\nwas shown that these components, which can be rather complicated, depend sensitively on\nthe choice of the base surface of the elliptic fibration and on the explicit form of the curve WB\n7\n\n\f. However, in this paper, it is not necessary to know the explicit form of these components\nof moduli space, and we will not discuss them further.\nWe are particularly interested in the component of moduli space where all the fibers are\nassociated with the base curve WB except for one, that is, when\nn = 116\n\n(2.27)\n\nThe relevant component of moduli space is then\nM0 (WB \u03c3 + (116)F ) \u00d7 M(F )\n\n(2.28)\n\nM(F ) = F\u03023 \u00d7 CP1a\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere\n\nPhysically, this region of moduli space describes a situation where all the five\u2013branes are\nwrapped on the complicated curve WB \u03c3 + 116F except for one, which is wrapped on a\nvertical curve described by the pure fiber class F . The moduli of this single five\u2013brane,\nspecified by the space (2.29), are independent of the all other moduli. Therefore, this single\nfive\u2013brane can be discussed entirely by itself, without reference to the rest of the five\u2013brane\nclass. In the remainder of this paper, we will consider only this single five\u2013brane wrapped\non a curve described by the fiber class F . If, furthermore, we hold this five\u2013brane fixed at a\npoint y0 in the fifth direction of the bulk space, the moduli space is reduced to\nM(F ) = F\u03023\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe physical properties of this single five\u2013brane are then completely determined by the\nbehavior of the elliptic fiber F on which the five\u2013brane is wrapped as one moves around the\nbase space B = F\u03023 .\nThe fiber over a generic point in B = F\u03023 is a smooth torus. Therefore, the worldvolume\nfields of a five\u2013brane wrapped on a generic fiber consist of the standard ones associated with\nthe self\u2013dual anti\u2013symmetric tensor multiplet. However, as is well known, the torus fibers can\nbecome singular at specific points in the base surface. The locus of points where the fibers\ndegenerate is a divisor of the base called the discriminant locus. That is, the discriminant\nlocus is a smooth curve in B = F\u03023 . Let us choose a point on the discriminant curve and\nwrap a five\u2013brane around the degenerate torus fibered over that point. Then, as is well\nknown, in addition to the usual fields associated with the self\u2013dual anti\u2013symmetric tensor\nmultiplet, there are also massless BPS multiplets that appear on the five\u2013brane worldvolume.\n8\n\n\fThe properties of these new states are directly related to the \"singularity structure\" of the\nelliptic fiber at that point, which has been classified by Kodaira [10] and will be discussed\nbelow. The ensemble of these new states form a conformal field theory whose construction\nwill be one of the goals of this paper.\nFurthermore, the structure of the torus degeneration, that is, the Kodaira type of the\nelliptic fiber, can change as one considers different points on the discriminant curve. Therefore, the conformal field theory that appears when a five\u2013brane is wrapped on a degenerate\ntorus over one point of the discriminant curve, can be very different from that which occurs\nwhen it is wrapped on a degenerate fiber over a different point on the curve. In this paper,\nwe will present the general theory for determining the exotic multiplets and the associated\nconformal field theories on the five\u2013brane worldvolume. It is clear that the starting point of\nour analysis must be the construction of the allowed discriminant curves in the base B = F\u03023 ,\nand the computation of the exact Kodaira structure of the fiber degeneration. This will be\ncarried out in the next section.\n\n3\n\nConstructing The Discriminant Curves:\n\nA simple representation of an elliptic curve is given in the projective space CP2 by the\nWeierstrass equation\nzy 2 = 4x3 \u2212 g2 xz 2 \u2212 g3 z 3\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere (x, y, z) are the homogeneous coordinates of CP2 and g2 , g3 are constants. The origin\nof the elliptic curve is located at (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0). The torus described by (3.1) can become\ndegenerate if one of its cycles shrinks to zero. Such singular behavior is characterized by the\nvanishing of the discriminant\n\u2206 = g23 \u2212 27g32\n\n(3.2)\n\nEquation (3.1) can also represent an elliptically fibered threefold, W , if the coefficients\ng2 and g3 in the Weierstrass equation are functions over a base surface, B. Clearly W\nconstructed in this way has a zero section \u03c3 and we denote by L the co\u2013normal bundle over\n\u03c3. The correct way to express this fibration globally is to replace the projective plane CP2\nby a fourfold CP2 -bundle P \u2192 B where P = P(OB \u2295 L2 \u2295 L3 ). The notation P(M) stands\nfor the projectivization of a vector bundle M. There is a hyperplane line bundle OP (1) on\nP which corresponds to the divisor P(L2 \u2295 L3 ) \u2282 P and the coordinates x, y, z are sections\n9\n\n\fof OP (1) \u2297 L2 , OP (1) \u2297 L3 and OP (1) respectively. Equation (3.1) can now be interpreted as\nthe affine form of a global equation on P involving the sections x, y, z, as long as we require\ng2 and g3 to be sections of appropriate line bundles over the base B. It follows from (3.1)\nthat\ng2 \u223c L4 ,\n\ng3 \u223c L6\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe symbol \"\u223c\" simply means \"section of\". The zero locus of equation (3.1) defines an\nelliptically fibered threefold hypersurface of P , which is called a Weierstrass fibration over\nthe base B and which we will denote by W . In addition, note that the discriminant defined\nin equation (3.2) is a section of the line bundle\n\u2206 \u223c L12\n\n(3.4)\n\nover the base B. The zero locus of the discriminant section specifies a divisor of B, the\ndiscriminant curve. An elliptic fiber in W is degenerate if and only if it lies over a point in\nthe discriminant curve.\nLet us now demand that W be a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold. It follows that we must require\nc1 (T W ) = 0. It can be shown that this, in turn, implies\nL = KB\u22121\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere KB is the canonical bundle on the base, B. Condition (3.5) is rather strong and, as\nstated earlier, restricts the allowed base spaces of an elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold\nto be rational (del Pezzo, Hirzebruch, as well as certain blow\u2013ups of Hirzebruch surfaces) and\nEnriques surfaces (see for example [20, 21]). Henceforth, we will only discuss Weierstrass fibrations that are, in addition, Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. Using the fact that KB\u22121 = OB (c1 (B)),\nit follows from g2 and g3 are sections of the line bundles\ng2 \u223c OB (4c1 (B)),\n\ng3 \u223c OB (6c1 (B))\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis places constraints on the sections g2 and g3 that we will return to below. In addition,\nnote from (3.4) and (3.5) that the discriminant is a section of the line bundle\n\u2206 \u223c OB (12c1 (B))\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis condition implies that the discriminant curve in B must lie in the class 12c1 (B), a\nstrong restriction on allowed discriminant curves.\n10\n\n\fGenerally, Weierstrass fibrations can be singular. These singularities, however, can be\nremoved by \"blowing\u2013up\" the singular points, producing a smooth elliptically fibered threefold that we will denote by X. Despite the fact that c1 (T W ) = 0, the first Chern class of the\nblown\u2013up fibration X need not vanish and, hence, X need not be a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold.\nIt is possible to enforce the condition c1 (T X) = 0, but only at the cost of putting additional\nconstraints on the sections g2 and g3 . In this paper, we will always demand that X is a\nCalabi\u2013Yau threefold and, hence, that g2 and g3 are suitably constrained. In this paper, for\nsimplicity, we will restrict the discussion to blow\u2013ups such that each fiber of the induced\nfibration X \u2192 B will still be a complex curve. This then places further constraints on the\nallowed sections g2 and g3 . Finally, and conversely, it can be shown that any smooth elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold X with a zero section can be obtained as a resolution of\nthe singularities of a Weierstrass fibration.\nTo make these statements concrete, we now explicitly compute the discriminant curve\nfor an elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with base B = F3 .\n\nExample 1: B = F3\nConsider a smooth elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefold X with zero section \u03c3 and base\nB = F3 . As discussed previously, there are two effective classes E and S that together form\na basis of H2 (F3 , Z) with intersection numbers\nE * E = 0,\n\nS * S = \u22123,\n\nE *S =1\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe first and second Chern classes of B = F3 are given by\nc1 (F3 ) = 2S + 5E,\n\nc2 (F3 ) = 4\n\n(3.9)\n\nX is the resolution of a Weierstrass fibration over the base B = F3 with sections g2 , g3\nsatisfying (3.6) and discriminant \u2206 defined by (3.2) and satisfying (3.7). Let us first consider\nthe consequences of (3.6). To do this, we must discuss several important assertions. The\nfirst of these, Claim I, is the following.\n\u2022 The zero locus of any section g2 \u223c OB (4c1 (F3 )) and g3 \u223c OB (6c1 (F3 )) must necessarily\nvanish along S with order at least 2.\nThe proof of this assertion is outlined as follows. First consider g2 \u223c OB (4c1 (F3 )). Note\nthat one can always write\nOB (4c1 (F3 )) = OB (2S) \u2297 OB (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S)\n11\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fTo prove Claim I, we need to show that any section g2 \u223c OB (4c1 (F3 )) can be written in the\nform\ng2 = s2S \u2297 G2\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere\ns2S \u223c OB (2S),\n\nG2 \u223c OB (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S)\n\n(3.12)\n\nDenote the vector space of all sections of OB (4c1 (F3 )) and OB (4c1 (F3 )\u22122S) by H 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ))\nand H 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) respectively. The decomposition (3.11) will be satisfied if the dimensions of these two vector spaces are identical, which we now proceed to show. To do\nthis, consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 H 0 (F3 , 4c1(F3 ) \u2212 S) \u2192 H 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 )) \u2192 H 0 (S, 4c1 (F3 )|S )\n\n(3.13)\n\nNote, however, that\nH 0 (S, (4c1 (F3 ))|S ) = H 0(CP1 , 4c1 (F3 ) * S) = H 0 (CP1 , \u22124) = 0\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere we have used (3.8) and (3.9). Hence, dimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 S) = dimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 )).\nSimilarly, consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 H 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) \u2192 H 0 (F3 , 4c1(F3 ) \u2212 S) \u2192 H 0 (S, (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 S)|S )\n\n(3.15)\n\nand the relation\nH 0 (S, (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 S)|S ) = H 0 (CP1 , (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 S) * S) = H 0(CP1 , \u22121) = 0\n\n(3.16)\n\nTherefore, dimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) = dimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 S). Combining with the above\nrelation implies\ndimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) = dimH 0 (F3 , 4c1 (F3 ))\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis establishes the claim for the section g2 \u223c OB (4c1 (F3 )). The proof is similar for the\nsection g3 \u223c OB (6c1 (F3 )) and establishes that\ng3 = s2S \u2297 G3\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere\ns2S \u223c OB (2S),\n\nG3 \u223c OB (6c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S)\n12\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fSimply put, Claim I says that if in local coordinates u,v on B = F3 the curve S is given\nby u = 0, then, near S, g2 and g3 must be of the form\ng 2 = u 2 G2 ,\n\ng 3 = u 2 G3\n\n(3.20)\n\nHowever, it does not specify the form of G2 and G3 , which may or may not vanish on S.\nThe properties of G2 and G3 are further refined in a second claim, Claim II, which we state\nwithout proof.\n\u2022 The divisors 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S and 6c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S are \"very ample\".\nFor a divisor D in a space B to be very ample means that a) for any point p \u2208 B there must\nbe a curve in the class of D that passes through p and b) for any two disjoint points p, q \u2208 B\nthere must be a curve in the class of D that passes through p but not q, and a curve that\npasses through q but not p. Claim II tells us that there must exist sections g2 and g3 that\nvanish at exactly order 2 along S, that is, for which G2 (0, v) and G3 (0, v) are non-vanishing.\nUsing these results, we now turn to the discriminant curve \u2206 defined in (3.2) and the\nconsequences of (3.7). The third assertion, Claim III, is the following.\n\u2022 The zero locus of the discriminant \u2206 = g23 \u2212 27g32 \u223c OB (12c1 (F3 )) must necessarily\nvanish along S with order exactly 4. Furthermore, the zero locus of \u2206 also vanishes\nalong the curve described by \u03a3 = 20S + 60E. The curves S and \u03a3 do not intersect,\nthat is, S * \u03a3 = 0.\nThe proof of Claim III is as follows. First note from the definition of the discriminant\nsection \u2206 = g23 \u2212 27g32 and (3.11), (3.18) that\n\u2206 = s22S \u2297 \u220612c1 (B)\u22124S\n\n(3.21)\n\n\u220612c1 (B)\u22124S = s2S \u2297 G32 \u2212 27G23\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere\n\n\u00bfFrom Claim I we know that the zero locus of \u2206 vanishes along S with order at least 4.\nA in Claim I, we can show that the zero locus of \u2206 vanishes along S with order exactly 4.\nSimply put, this implies, in terms of the local coordinates u,v on B = F3 , that near S the\ndiscriminant \u2206 must be of the form\n\u2206 = u4 (\u221227G3 (0, v)3 )\n13\n\n(3.23)\n\n\fwhere the factor \u221227G3 (0, v)3 is non-vanishing. Now, note from (3.9) that\n12c1 (F3 ) \u2212 4S = 20S + 60E\n\n(3.24)\n\nWe conclude that \u2206 must also vanish along a curve of the form \u03a3 = 20S + 60E. Finally,\nusing equation (3.8) it is easy to see that S * \u03a3 = 0. This establishes Claim III. Finally, we\nprove a fourth assertion, Claim IV.\n\u2022 S is a smooth rational curve in B = F3 . A torus over any point on the curve S\ndegenerates as Kodaira type IV . The curve \u03a3 in B = F3 is smooth except at 200\ncusps. The fibers degenerate as Kodaira type I1 over the smooth parts of the curve\nand as Kodaira type II over each of the cusps.\nTo prove Claim IV, first consider the curve S. It follows from (3.20), Claim II and (3.23)\nthat, in local coordinates near S, sections g2 , g3 and \u2206 have the form\ng 2 = u 2 G2 ,\n\ng 3 = u 2 G3 ,\n\n\u2206 = u4 (\u221227G3 (0, v)3)\n\n(3.25)\n\nUsing Table 1, we find that any torus over a point on the curve S degenerates as a Kodaira\nfiber of Type IV . Now consider the curve specified by \u03a3. There are two ways in which\nthe section \u220612c1 (B)\u22124S = s2S \u2297 G32 \u2212 27G23 can vanish on \u03a3. First, G2 and G3 can vanish\nsimultaneously. We see from (3.12) and (3.19) that this will occur precisely at the points of\nintersection of the divisors 4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S and 6c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S. Since these divisors, by Claim II,\nare very ample, then, G2 and G3 can be chosen so that, near each such intersection point,\nthey are local coordinates of the base. Denoting G2 = s and G3 = t, then the discriminant\ncurve is described by the equation\nf (s, t)s3 \u2212 27t2 = 0\n\n(3.26)\n\nwhere the function f (s, t), which represents u2 evaluated in s, t coordinates, is non-vanishing\nin the neighborhood of the curve. One can check that this curve has a cusp at the point\n(s, t) = (0, 0). That is, each intersection point corresponds to a cusp of the curve \u03a3. It\nfollows that in the neighborhood of a cusp, the Weierstrass equation (3.1) for the elliptic\nfiber can be written as\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 f (s, t)sx \u2212 f (s, t)t\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhere we have used the affine coordinate z = 1. This defines a smooth threefold. Exactly\nat the cusp, this equation becomes\ny 2 = 4x3\n14\n\n(3.28)\n\n\fwhich is well known to describe a fiber of Kodaira type II. Clearly, the total number of such\ncusps, Ncusps , of the curve \u03a3 is given by\nNcusps = (4c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) * (6c1 (F3 ) \u2212 2S) = 200\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere we have used expressions (3.8) and (3.9). Away from these 200 cusps, the curve \u03a3\nis smooth. Along the smooth part of the curve, we can introduce new local coordinates\nS = f (s, t)s3 \u2212 27t2 and an independent variable T such that \u03a3 is defined by S = 0. We see\nthen that the sections g2 , g3 and \u2206, in a neighborhood of the smooth part of the curve \u03a3,\nhave the form\ng2 = S 0 G2 ,\n\ng3 = S 0 G3 ,\n\n\u2206 = S 1f 2\n\n(3.30)\n\nwhere G2 , G2 and f are functions of S and T which do not vanish on \u03a3. It follows from Table\n1 that the torus over any point on the smooth part of the curve \u03a3 degenerates as Kodaira\ntype I1 .

Using this data,\none can, as outlined above, compute the discriminant curves. We will simply state the\nresults.\n\nCase 1:\nThe discriminant curve is composed of three components\n\u2206= S \u222a\u03c3\u222a\u03a3\n17\n\n(3.38)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03a3 = 16S + 54F + 44G\n\n(3.39)\n\nIt follows from (3.34) and (3.35) that\nS * \u03c3 = 0,\n\n\u03c3 * \u03a3 = 44,\n\nS *\u03a3=6\n\n(3.40)\n\nThe intersection number \u03c3 * \u03a3 = 44 corresponds to 36 intersection points of \u03c3 with \u03a3, 28 of\nwhich are simple normal crossing, whereas 8 have tangential intersections of multiplicity 2.\nThe 6 intersection points of S with \u03a3 are all simple normal crossings.

There are non-Kodaira fibers (NK) over\nthe points where the S component intersects the \u03a3 components normally. There are I3 fibers where\nthe \u03c3 component meets the \u03a3 component normally, and fibers of type III where the \u03c3 component\nintersects the \u03a3 component tangentially.\n\n19\n\n\fwhere\nS * \u03c3 = 0,\n\n\u03c3 * \u03a3 = 44\n\n(3.43)\n\nThe intersection number \u03c3 * \u03a3 = 44 corresponds to 36 intersection points of \u03c3 with \u03a3, 28\nof which correspond to simple normal crossing whereas 8 have tangential intersections of\nmultiplicity 2. The component curve \u03a3 always has a finite number of cusps. Away from the\nintersection points and the cusps, the discriminant curve is smooth.

This formalism was applied to a specific\nCalabi\u2013Yau threefold with a blown\u2013up Hirzebruch base B = F\u03023 . Each of the discriminant\ncurves was shown to be composed of smooth sections, as well as cusps, simple normal crossing points and tangential crossings. In this paper, we will be concerned with five\u2013branes\nwrapped on elliptic fibers near the smooth parts of the discriminant curves only. We leave\nthe discussion of five\u2013branes near the cusps, simple normal crossings and tangential crossing\npoints to another publication.\n\n4\n\nMonodromy, Massless States and Brane Junctions:\n\nIn this section, we will compute the massless spectrum on the worldvolume of five\u2013branes\nwrapped on elliptic fibers near the smooth parts of discriminant curves. This is accomplished\nby demonstrating the equivalence, in this context, of degenerating M membranes to string\njunctions, and using the junction lattice techniques developed in [26, 27]. For concreteness,\nwe present our results within the context of the three\u2013family, SU(5) model compactified\non a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with blown\u2013up Hirzebruch base B = F\u03023 presented above. This\nformalism, however, is applicable to any theory compactified on elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013\nYau threefolds.\nWe begin by briefly reviewing the worldvolume theory of an M\u2013theory five\u2013brane wrapped\non a smooth elliptic fiber C2 located far from the discriminant locus. First, consider a five\u2013\nbrane in flat space\u2013time. The massless worldvolume degrees of freedom then form a six\u2013\ndimensional (2, 0) supersymmetric tensor multiplet. The bosonic content of this multiplet\nconsists of five scalar fields, X i , i = 1, .., 5 describing translations in the transverse directions\ntogether with a two\u2013form B whose field strength H = dB is self\u2013dual, H = \u2217H. When the\nfive\u2013brane is wrapped on a smooth elliptic fiber of a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold, four of the scalars\nbecome moduli for the location of the fiber, that is, they are coordinates of the base surface\nB. We denote these four fields by u1 , u2 , v1 , and v2 . The fifth scalar, which we denote by y,\ncontinues to parameterize translations in the remaining transverse direction. The behavior\nof the self\u2013dual field strength is a little more complicated. The cohomology classes of a\nsmooth elliptic fiber are those of a real two\u2013torus, that is, H 0 , H 1 and H 2 with dimensions\none, two and one respectively. We denote a basis of H 0 by 1, of H 1 by the two harmonic\none\u2013forms \u03bbc , c = 1, 2 and of H 2 by the harmonic volume form \u03a9. If we decompose the\n22\n\n\ffive\u2013brane worldvolume as C2 \u00d7 M4 , then the field strength H can be expanded as\nH = da \u2227 \u03a9 + F c \u2227 \u03bbc + h\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the four\u2013dimensional fields are a scalar \"axion\" a, two U(1) vector fields F c = dAc and\na three\u2013form field strength h = db. However, not all of these fields are independent because\nof the self\u2013duality condition H = \u2217H. Applying this condition leads to the constraints\nF 2 = \u2217F 1 ,\n\nh = \u2217da\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe conclude that the two\u2013form B decomposes into an axionic scalar field a and a single U(1)\ngauge connection A\u03bc . Putting everything together, we find that for a five\u2013brane compactified\non a smooth elliptic fiber C2 , the bosonic worldvolume fields on M4 are A\u03bc , a, y, u1, u2, v1 , v2 .\nThese fields, along with their fermionic superpartners, form an N = 4 vector supermultiplet.\nThe low energy worldvolume field theory on M4 exhibits N = 4 supersymmetry, but this is\nbroken to N = 1 supersymmetry by higher dimension operators. The N = 4 vector supermultiplet decomposes under N = 1 supersymmetry into an Abelian Yang\u2013Mills multiplet\nwith bosonic field A\u03bc , and three chiral multiplets with bosonic fields Y = y + ia, u = u1 + iu2\nand v = v1 + iv2 respectively. Note that none of these chiral supermultiplets is charged. Before continuing, we record the fact that the first homology group of a smooth elliptic fiber,\nH1 (C2 , Z), has dimension two and a basis of one\u2013cycles \u03c9c , c = 1, 2. It follows that, in this\nbasis, any cycle in H1 (C2 , Z) is specified by (p, q), where p, q \u2208 Z.\nWe see from the examples given in the previous section that elliptic fibers above different\npoints on the smooth parts of discriminant curves can have very different degeneration\ncharacteristics. The simplest, which, for example, occurs at the smooth parts of the \u03a3\ncomponent curve, is associated with Kodaira type I1 . We will discuss this case first.\n\nKodaira Type I1 :\nIn the neighborhood of a smooth point on the discriminant curve, one can always define\ntwo special complex coordinates, a coordinate u transverse to the curve and a coordinate v\nalong the curve. Note that previously these coordinates were designated by various symbols,\nsuch as S and T , but, henceforth, we will call the complex coordinates near any component\nof the discriminant curve u and v. Now pick an arbitrary point on the smooth part of\nthe discriminant curve with a fiber of Kodaira type I1 , and choose the origin of the u, v\ncoordinates to be at that point. Recall from (3.30) that, in the neighborhood of this point,\n23\n\n\fthe associated sections have the form\ng2 = u0 G2 ,\n\ng3 = u0 G3 ,\n\n\u2206 = u1 f 2\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere G2 , G3 and f , to leading order in u, are non\u2013zero functions of v only. We see from (3.2)\nthat the first two functions must satisfy\nG23 \u2212 27G32 = 0\n\n(4.4)\n\nIt follows from (3.1) and (4.3) that, at the origin, the Weierstrass form of the elliptic fiber\nbecomes\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 G2 x \u2212 G3\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere we have used affine coordinates with z = 1. This is the standard Weierstrass representation of an elliptic fiber of Kodaira type I1 .\nIn the neighborhood of a point on the smooth part of the discriminant curve, the symmetry between the complex moduli u and v, that exists far from the discriminant locus, is\nbroken. Hence, near such a point, the N = 4 supersymmetry of the low energy M4 worldvolume theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane is reduced to N = 2 supersymmetry. The N = 4\nvector supermultiplet discussed above then decomposes into two N = 2 supermultiplets, an\nAbelian Yang-Mills multiplet with bosonic field content A\u03bc , u and a hypermultiplet with the\nbosonic fields Y , v. As is the case far from the discriminant curve, the supersymmetry is\nbroken to N = 1 supersymmetry by higher dimension operators.\nTo discuss the monodromy, we must restrict to the fibration over a curve that intersects\nthe discriminant locus at the origin. The \"generic\" curves are transverse to the discriminant\nlocus, that is, their intersection multiplicity with the discriminant locus is 1. Surfaces over\ncurves with multiplicity greater than 1 are singular at the discriminant point, while those\nover generic curves are smooth. Therefore, we will choose the intersection surface to be the\nfibration over a generic curve. Note that the path P defined by v = 0, which has coordinate\nu, is tranverse to the discriminant curve and, hence, is generic. For specificity, we will take\nthe intersecting surface to be the elliptic fibration over P, which we denote by T . Restricted\nto this surface, the discriminant curve appears as a point in the one\u2013dimensional complex\nbase P. Furthermore, the forms of g2 , g3 , and \u2206, as well as the Weierstrass form of the\nelliptic fiber, restricted to this twofold remain those given in (4.3) and (4.5) with G2 , G3 ,\nand f evaluated at v = 0. It follows from Table 1 that, within T , the degeneration of the\nfiber near the discriminant point remains Kodaira type I1 . Since the problem has now been\n24\n\n\freduced to an elliptic twofold over a one\u2013dimensional base, we can apply standard Kodaira\ntheory to analyze the monodromy.\nBefore proceeding, it is important to discuss the structure of the elliptic fibration T over\nthe generic base curve P. T will be a K3 twofold if and only if P * P = 0, which guarantees\nc1 (T ) = 0 and P is rational, which implies that H1 (T , Z) = 0. For the specific threefold\nbase B = F\u03023 and the smooth parts of the discriminant curves discussed in this paper, both\nof these properties are satisfied. However, they need not be true for general threefold bases\nand discriminant curves, and have to be checked on a case by case basis. In general, T need\nnot be a K3 surface.\nThe SL(2, Z) monodromy transformation for a type I1 fiber can be found from Table 1,\nand is given by\nA=\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis transformation acts on the elements of H1 (C2 , Z) and has, up to multiplication by\nnon\u2013zero integers, a single eigenvector\n~ = (1, 0)\nV\n\n(4.7)\n\nwith eigenvalue +1. The meaning of this result is the following. Consider an elliptic fiber C2\n~ = (1, 0), is\nover a point, z, near, but not at, the discriminant locus. Then the one\u2013cycle, V\nthe unique cycle (up to multiplication) in H1 (C2 , Z) that contracts to zero as the base point\n~ = (1, 0) is the unique \"vanishing cycle\"\nof the fiber is moved to the discriminant. That is, V\n(see for example [24]).\nThe physical implications of this arise as follows. Fix a curve in the base from point z\n~ = (1, 0) in the\nto the discriminant locus. Now consider a membrane in T bounded by V\nelliptic fiber over z, whose intersection with the fiber over each point on this curve is the\nvanishing cycle. Note that this membrane \"ends\" on the degenerate cycle of the I1 fiber over\nthe discriminant locus. A T \u2013membrane of this type is shown in Figure 3. One can show\nthat membranes constructed in this manner have representatives which are holomorphic\ntwo-cycles in T , albeit with respect to a different complex structure than the usual one\ncompatible with the elliptic fibration. The class of such membranes lies in the relative\nhomology H2 (T /F, Z) and will be denoted by ~v . If T = K3, then [25] the self\u2013intersection\nnumber of any class ~v containing a holomorphic two\u2013cycle is given by\n~v * ~v = 2g \u2212 2 + b\n25\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhere g is the genus and b is the number of boundaries. In our case, g = 0, b = 1 and, hence\n~v * ~v = \u22121\n\n(4.9)\n\nWhen T is not a K3 surface, the situation requires further analysis. However, we are able\nto show that for a general surface T self\u2013intersection (4.9) continues to hold. This is done\nas follows. Consider a second membrane ~v \u2032 homologous to ~v . These membranes intersect\nonly at the collapsed cycle in the Kodaira fiber over the discriminant point and at the (1, 0)\ncycle in the fiber C2 over z. Using the fact that the self\u2013intersection of the (1, 0) cycle is\nzero, it follows that the intersection number of ~v \u2032 with ~v and, hence, the self\u2013intersection of\n~v is \u00b11. Since this result is topological, we see from (4.9) that for any surface T , not just\nK3, ~v * ~v = \u22121.\nAs long as the five\u2013brane is wrapped on an elliptic fiber reasonably far from the discriminant, the fluctuations of this membrane are massive and can be ignored in the low energy\neffective theory. However, as the elliptic fiber approaches the discriminant point, these fluctuations become less and less heavy, finally becoming exactly massless when the five\u2013brane is\nwrapped on the degenerate I1 Kodaira fiber. Therefore, at the discriminant locus we expect\nlight BPS states to enter the M4 low energy theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane.\nTo compute these states, first note that any cycle of the form (p, 0), where p \u2208 Z, is an\neigenvector of the monodromy A, not just (1, 0). The class of the associated membrane is\ndenoted by\nJ~ = n~v\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere n \u2208 Z. The vanishing cycle associated with this class is given by\n(p, q) = n(1, 0)\n\n(4.11)\n\nand, hence, p = n and q = 0. It follows from (4.9) that the self\u2013intersection number is\nJ~ * J~ = \u2212n2\n\n(4.12)\n\nAt this point, it is very useful to note from Figure 3 that the projection of such a membrane\ninto the base produces a string indexed by ~v , integer n and (p, q). These are the fundamental objects that compose string junction lattices [26, 27], which we review briefly in the\nAppendix. Furthermore, the self\u2013intersection number of class ~v given in (4.9) coincides with\nthe norm of the string ~v defined in [26]. Therefore, computations from the points of view\nof the T \u2013membrane and the string junction lattice coincide. We will, therefore, use either\n26\n\n\fmethod interchangeably. Note that, in general, membranes with boundary on the (p, q) cycle\nwithin a wrapped five\u2013brane give rise to states with electric and magnetic charges p and q.\nAs discussed in the Appendix, the condition for the associated state to be BPS saturated is\nthat [27, 28]\nJ~ * J~ \u2265 \u22122 + gcd(p, q)\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere \"gcd\" stands for the greatest common positive divisor of p and q. In the case under\nconsideration, since q = 0, this condition becomes\nJ~ * J~ \u2265 |n| \u2212 2\n\n(4.14)\n\nComparing this with (4.12), it is clear that the state will be BPS saturated if and only if\nn = \u00b11. This CPT conjugate pair of allowed BPS states, ([1], [\u22121]), combine to form a\nsingle, stable N = 2 hypermultiplet \u03a6(1,0) , of electric charge Qe = 1 and vanishing magnetic\ncharge, in the M4 worldvolume theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane. The non\u2013BPS states are\neither unstable or massive.\n\n= (p,q)\n\nn\n\n(p,q)\n\nn\n\n\u2206= 0\n\nFigure 3: A membrane with boundary cycle in an elliptic fiber near a Kodaira type I1 degeneracy.\n~ = (p, q) = (n, 0) associated with the I1\nIn this example, the boundary cycle is the vanishing cycle V\nfiber, and n~v is the homology class J~ of the membrane. The discriminant locus is the point in the\nbase at which \u2206 = 0. When projected to the base, the membrane becomes the string illustrated\nabove.\n\n27\n\n\fWe conclude that, near a point on a smooth part of the discriminant curve with elliptic\nfiber of Kodaira type I1 , the M4 worldvolume theory of a wrapped five\u2013brane has N = 2\nsupersymmetry at low energy. In addition to the \"standard\" Abelian Yang\u2013Mills supermultiplet with gauge connection A\u03bc and an uncharged hypermultiplet, the I1 degeneracy of the\nelliptic fiber produces a light BPS hypermultiplet\n\u2022 \u03a6(1,0)\n\nQe = 1, Qm = 0\n\nThis electric charge couples to the gauge connection A\u03bc .\nThe next simplest possibility, which, for example, occurs at the smooth parts of the \u03c3\ncomponent curve, is associated with Kodaira type I2 . We will discuss this case in the next\nsubsection.\n\nKodaira Type I2 :\nPick any point on the smooth part of the discriminant curve with a fiber of Kodaira type\nI2 , and choose the origin of the u, v coordinates to be at that point. In the neighborhood of\nthis point, the associated sections have the form\ng2 = u0 G2 ,\n\ng3 = u0 G3 ,\n\n\u2206 = u2 f 2\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere G2 , G3 , and f , to leading order in u, are non\u2013zero functions of v only (see (3.30)). We\nsee from (3.2) that the first two functions must satisfy (4.4). It follows from (3.1) and (4.15)\nthat, at the origin, the Weierstrass form for the elliptic fiber is again given by (4.5). This is\nthe standard Weierstrass representation of an elliptic fiber of Kodaira type I2 . As discussed\nabove, near such a point, the N = 4 supersymmetry of the low energy M4 worldvolume\ntheory of the wrapped five\u2013brane is reduced to N = 2 supersymmetry. This is broken to\nN = 1 supersymmetry by higher dimension operators.\nAs above, we can restrict the discussion to the elliptic fibration T over the path P with\ncoordinate u that is transverse to the discriminant curve . The discriminant curve now\nappears as a point in the one\u2013dimensional complex base P. Furthermore, the forms of g2 , g3\nand \u2206, as well as the Weierstrass form of the elliptic fiber, restricted to this twofold remains\nthose given in (4.15) and (4.5) with G2 , G3 and f evaluated at v = 0. Then it follows from\nTable 1 that, within T , the degeneracy of the fiber near the discriminant point remains\nKodaira type I2 .\n28\n\n\fThe SL(2, Z) monodromy transformation for a type I2 fiber can be found from Table 1,\nand is given by\n1 2\n\nMI2 =\n\n0 1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.16)\n\nThis transformation acts on the elements of H1 (C2 , Z) and has, up to multiplication by a\nnon\u2013zero integer, the single eigenvector (4.7) with eigenvalue +1. At this point, however,\nthe situation diverges substantially from that of the Kodaira type I1 case above. This is\nsignaled by the appearance of the 2 in the monodromy matrix, which implies that it can be\ndecomposed as\nMI2 =\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n*\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n=A*A\n\n(4.17)\n\n~ = (1, 0) that are relevant to\nIt follows that there are now two copies of the eigenvector V\nthe problem. One way to explore this issue is to locally deform the Weierstrass equation\nand, hence. the discriminant in such a way that its locus, the single point at the origin with\nKodaira type I2 , is split into two nearby discriminant loci, which we label 1 and 2, each with\nKodaira type I1 . Then, the monodromy at each of these points is simply given by (4.6), with\na single eigenvector (4.7). A deformation of the Weierstrass equation that will accomplish\nthis is given by\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 G2 x \u2212 G3 + u(u + \u01eb)b\n\n(4.18)\n\nHere, b is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the u expansion of g3 and \u01eb is a complex\ndeformation parameter. Note, in passing, that under such a deformation a K3 twofold\nremains K3. The meaning of this result is the following. Consider an elliptic fiber C2 over\n~ = (1, 0)\na point, z, near, but not at, the two discriminant loci. Then the one\u2013cycle V\nis the unique cycle in H1 (C2 , Z) that contracts to zero as the fiber is moved to either of\n~ is the unique vanishing cycle associated with both\nthe two discriminant points. That is, V\ndiscriminant loci.\nThe physical implications arise from considering a T \u2013membrane whose boundary in the\n~ = (1, 0) and which \"ends\" on the I1 fiber over either point 1 or\nelliptic fiber over z is V\n2 in the discriminant locus. Membranes of this type have a very specific structure. Recall\nthat in the I1 case above there was only one type of membrane, which ended on the unique\ndiscriminant point. In contrast, in the I2 case there are two types of membranes, one type\n29\n\n\fending on the I1 fiber over discriminant point 1 and the other type ending on the I1 fiber\nover discriminant point 2. We will denote the classes associated with discriminant points 1\nand 2 by v~1 and v~2 respectively. Independently of whether or not T is a K3 surface, we can\nshow that the intersections of these membrane classes are given by\nv~1 * v~1 = v~2 * v~2 = \u22121,\n\nv~1 * v~2 = 0\n\n(4.19)\n\nThe proof for the self\u2013intersections was presented in the section on I1 and does not change\nhere. Using the fact that ~v1 and ~v2 intersect only on the (1, 0) cycle in the fiber C2 over z,\nand that the self\u2013intersection of this cycle vanishes, it follows that ~v1 * ~v2 = 0. A generic\nmembrane of this type, projected into the base, is the string junction shown in Figure 4. We\nnote that the membrane intersection numbers in (4.19) are identical to the string junction\nlattice intersection form presented in (6.3) and (6.4) in the Appendix. Therefore, once\nagain, we can use the membrane and string junction lattice formalism interchangeably. As\nthe elliptic fiber approaches either of the discriminant points, the membrane fluctuations\nbecome less and less heavy, becoming exactly massless when the five\u2013brane is wrapped on\nthe degenerate I1 Kodaira fiber over point 1 or 2. Therefore, at either of the two discriminant\nloci, we expect light BPS states to enter the M4 low energy theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane.\nTo compute these states, we first note that any cycle of the form (p, 0), where p \u2208 Z, is\nan eigenvector of the monodromy MI2 , not just (1, 0). The class of the associated membrane\nis denoted by\nJ~ = n1 v~1 + n2 v~2\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere n1 , n2 \u2208 Z. The boundary cycle associated with this class is given by\n(p, q) = n1 (1, 0) + n2 (1, 0)\n\n(4.21)\n\nand, hence, p = n1 + n2 and q = 0. It follows from (4.19) that the self\u2013intersection number\nis\nJ~ * J~ = \u2212n21 \u2212 n22\n\n(4.22)\n\nHowever, recall that (4.13) is the condition for the associated state to be BPS saturated. In\nthe case under consideration, since q = 0, this condition becomes\nJ~ * J~ \u2265 |n1 + n2 | \u2212 2\n30\n\n(4.23)\n\n\fComparing this with (4.22), it is clear that a state will be BPS saturated if and only if the\npair n1 , n2 takes the values \u00b11, 0 or 0, \u00b11. The two BPS states described by ([1, 0], [\u22121, 0]),\ncombine to form a single, stable N = 2 hypermultiplet, \u03a61(1,0) , of electric charge Qe = 1 and\nvanishing magnetic charge, in the M4 worldvolume theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane. Similarly, the states associated with ([0, 1], [0, \u22121]) form a second, stable N = 2 hypermultiplet,\n\u03a62(1,0) , also with Qe = 1 and Qm = 0. The non-BPS states are either unstable or massive.\n\n(p,q)\n\nn1\n\nn2\n2\n\n1\n\nFigure 4: A string junction arising for a split I2 fiber. The sum n1~v1 + n2~v2 is the homology class\nJ~ of the membrane. The boundary cycle is (p, q), where p = n1 + n2 and q = 0. The vanishing\ncycle associated with both ~v1 and ~v2 is (1, 0).\n\nFurther important information can be extracted by rewriting the membrane class J~\nin (4.20) as follows. Define classes\n1\nw\n~ p = (v1 + v2 ),\n2\n\n1\nw\n~ = (v1 \u2212 v2 )\n2\n\n(4.24)\n\nThen, in terms of these classes, J~ can be written as\nJ~ = pw\n~ p + aw\n~\n\n(4.25)\n\nwhere p = n1 + n2 and a = n1 \u2212 n2 . It is useful to proceed one step further and write this\nequation as\nJ~ = pw\n~ p + aC \u22121 \u03b1\n~\nwhere C \u22121 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(4.26)\n\nand \u03b1\n~ = 2w.\n~ Note that\n\u03b1\n~ = v1 \u2212 v2\n31\n\n(4.27)\n\n\fwhich is associated with the cycle (p, q) = (0, 0) and, hence, corresponds to no boundary\ncycle at all. Such classes are described by curves from discriminant point 1 to discriminant\npoint 2, as shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, it follows from (4.19) that\n\u03b1\n~ *\u03b1\n~ = \u22122\n\n(4.28)\n\nWe see, by comparing equations (4.26) and (4.27) with (6.6) and (6.7) in the Appendix, that\nclass \u03b1\n~ corresponds to the simple root of the Lie algebra of SU(2).\n\n\u03b1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nFigure 5: The junction corresponding to the simple root of SU (2).\nNote that, written as a pair [n1 , n2 ], class \u03b1\n~ = [1, \u22121]. It follows that the BPS states\nthat make up the hypermultiplet \u03a61(1,0) , specified by [1, 0] and [\u22121, 0], are related to the\nBPS states, [0, 1] and [0, \u22121], that make up the hypermultiplet \u03a62(1,0) through addition and\nsubtraction of the root vector \u03b1\n~ . That is\n[1, 0] \u2212 \u03b1\n~ = [0, 1],\n\n[\u22121, 0] + \u03b1\n~ = [0, \u22121]\n\n(4.29)\n\nFurther addition and subtraction of the root \u03b1\n~ leads to unstable or massive non\u2013BPS states.\nIt follows that hypermultiplets \u03a61(1,0) and \u03a62(1,0) form a doublet representation of SU(2). The\nappearance of an SU(2) global group can be read off directly from the A-D-E column of\nTable 1. For Kodaira type I2 , the A-D-E classification is A1 , which corresponds to the group\nSU(2).\nWe conclude that, near a point on a smooth part of the discriminant curve with elliptic\nfiber of Kodaira type I2 , the M4 worldvolume theory of a wrapped five\u2013brane has N = 2\nsupersymmetry at low energy. In addition to the \"standard\" Abelian Yang\u2013Mills supermultiplet with gauge connection A\u03bc and an uncharged hypermultiplet, the I2 degeneracy of the\nelliptic fiber produces an SU(2) doublet 2 of light BPS hypermultiplets\n\u2022 \u03a6i(1,0)\n\nQe = 1, Qm = 0\n32\n\n\fwhere i = 1, 2. The electric charge couples to the gauge connection A\u03bc .\nWe now turn our attention to more a more complicated situation, specifically that of a\nKodaira type IV fiber occuring at the smooth part of the discriminant curve. Such fibers\nare found, for example, over the smooth part of the component curve S in Case 3 above.\nThe analysis of this example contains most of the elements necessary to compute the light\nBPS states for a fiber of any Kodaira type over a smooth part of the discriminant curve.\n\nKodaira Type IV:\nPick any point on the smooth part of the discriminant curve with a fiber of Kodaira type\nIV , and choose the origin of the u, v coordinates to be at that point. In the neighborhood\nof this point, the associated sections have the form\ng2 = uL G2 ,\n\ng3 = u2 G3 ,\n\n\u2206 = u4 f 2\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere L > 1 and G2 , G3 and f , to leading order in u, are non\u2013vanishing functions of v only.\nFurther analysis of the explicit curve S in Case 3 above fixes the value of coefficient L to be\nL = 2. We see from (3.2) that, near the discriminant locus,\n\u2206 = g23 \u2212 27g32 = u4 (\u221227G32 )\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhich vanishes at the locus without any further restrictions on G2 and G3 . It follows from (3.1)\nand (4.30) that, at the origin, the Weierstrass form of the elliptic fiber becomes\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 u2 G2 x \u2212 u2 G3\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhere we have used affine coordinates with z = 1. This is the Weierstrass representation\nof an elliptic fiber of Kodaira type IV . Near such a point, the N = 4 supersymmetry of\nthe low energy M4 worldvolume theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane is reduced to N = 2\nsupersymmetry. This is broken to N = 1 supersymmetry by higher dimensional operators.\nAs above, we can restrict the discussion to the elliptic fibration over the path P with\ncoordinate u that is transverse to the discriminant curve . The discriminant curve now\nappears as a point in the one\u2013dimensional complex base P. The forms of g2 , g3 and \u2206, as\nwell as the Weierstrass form of the elliptic fiber, restricted to this twofold remain those given\nin (4.30) and (4.32) with G2 , G3 and f evaluated at v = 0. It follows from Table 1 that,\nwithin T , the degeneracy of the fiber near the discriminant point remains that of Kodaira\ntype IV .\n33\n\n\fThe SL(2, Z) monodromy transformation for a type IV fiber can be found from Table\n1. Here, for technical reasons, it is convenient to use a monodromy matrix conjugate to the\none listed in Table 1 given by\nMIV =\n\n\u22121 1\n\u22121 0\n\n!\n\n(4.33)\n\nThis transformation acts on the elements of H1 (C2 , Z). However, unlike the previous cases\nof Kodaira type I1 and I2 , MIV has no real eigenvector and, therefore, there is no obvious\nassociated vanishing cycle. An indication as how to proceed is given by the fact that MIV\ncan be decomposed as\nMIV =\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n*\n\n!\n1 1\n0 1\n\n*\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n*\n\n2\n\n!\n1\n\n\u22121 0\n\n=A*A*A*B\n\n(4.34)\n\nFollowing the technique employed in the I2 case, we proceed by deforming the discriminant\ncurve in such a way that its locus, the single point at the origin with Kodaira type IV , is\nsplit into four nearby discriminant points, which we label 1,2,3 and 4. This corresponds to\na relevant deformation of the Weierstrass representation given by\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 u2 G2 x \u2212 u2 G3 + \u01eb\n\n(4.35)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a constant deformation parameter. The first three points each have a Kodaira\nfiber of type I1 with the monodromy given in (4.6) and, up to multiplication by a non\u2013zero\ninteger, the single eigenvector (4.7). The fourth point, however, has monodromy\n!\n2 1\nB=\n\u22121 0\n\n(4.36)\n\nwith, up to multiplication by a non\u2013zero integer, the eigenvector\n~ = (1, \u22121)\n\u1e7c\n\n(4.37)\n\nAt first glance, it is not obvious what Kodaira type one is finding in this last case. However,\nit is easy to show that A is, in fact, conjugate to B and, hence, the fiber at point 4 is also of\nKodaira type I1 . The meaning of these results is the following. Consider an elliptic fiber C2\n~ = (1, 0)\nover a point, z, near, but not at, the four discriminant loci. Then the one\u2013cycle V\nis the unique cycle in H1 (C2 , Z) that contracts to zero as the fiber is moved to each of the\n~ is the unique vanishing cycle\ndiscriminant points 1, 2, and 3 without encircling 4. That is, V\n34\n\n\f~ = (1, \u22121) is the\nassociated with the first three discriminant loci. Similarly, the one\u2013cycle \u1e7c\nunique cycle in H1 (C2 , Z) that contracts to zero as the fiber is moved to the discriminant\n~ is the unique vanishing cycle associated with\npoint 4 without encircling 1, 2 or 3. That is, \u1e7c\nthe fourth discriminant locus.\nThe physical implications of this arise as follows. T \u2013 membranes that are bounded by\n~ = (1, 0) in the elliptic fiber over z are of a very specific structure.\nthe vanishing cycle V\nThere are three membranes of this type, each \"ending\" on the I1 fiber over discriminant\npoints 1,2 or 3 respectively. Similarly, membranes that are bounded by the vanishing cycle\n~ = (1, \u22121) have a very specific structure. These membranes \"end\" on the I fiber over the\n\u1e7c\n1\n\ndiscriminant point 4. We will denote the T \u2013membrane classes associated with discriminant\npoints 1, 2,3 and 4 by v~1 ,v~2 , v~3 and v~4 respectively. A generic membrane class of this type,\nprojected into the base, is the string junction shown in Figure 6. Note from the Appendix\nthat the intersections of these membrane classes are given by\nv~1 * v~1 = v~2 * v~2 = v~3 * v~3 = v~4 * v~4 = \u22121\n\n(4.38)\n\nv~1 * v~2 = v~1 * v~3 = v~2 * v~3 = 0\n\n(4.39)\n\nv~1 * v~4 = v~2 * v~4 = v~3 * v~4 = \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n(4.40)\n\nAs the elliptic fiber approaches any one of the discriminant points, the membrane fluctuations\nbecome less and less heavy, becoming exactly massless when the five\u2013brane is wrapped on the\ndegenerate I1 Kodaira fiber over point 1,2,3 or 4. Therefore, at any of the four discriminant\nloci, we expect light BPS states to enter the M4 low energy theory of the wrapped five\u2013brane.\nTo compute these states, we first note, by analogy with the above discussion, that the\nclasses of the associated membranes are given by\nJ~ = \u03a34i=1 ni v~i\n\n(4.41)\n\nwhere ni , i = 1, .., 4 are arbitrary integers. Using (4.7) and (4.37), it follows that the\nassociated boundary cycles in H1 (C2 , Z) are given by\n(p, q) = \u03a33i=1 ni (1, 0) + n4 (1, \u22121)\n\n(4.42)\n\nand, hence, p = \u03a34i=1 ni and q = \u2212n4 . From (4.39), we find that the self\u2013intersection number\nof class J~ is\nJ~ * J~ = \u2212\u03a34i=1 n2i \u2212 (n1 + n2 + n3 )n4\n35\n\n(4.43)\n\n\fHowever, recall that (4.13) is the condition for the associated state to be BPS saturated.\nComparing this to (4.43), it was shown in [26, 27] that a state will be BPS saturated if and\nonly if n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 take the values\n\n(n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 )\n\n(p, q)\n\n(1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0)\n\n(1, 0)\n\n(\u22121, 0, 0, 0), (0, \u22121, 0, 0), (0, 0, \u22121, 0)\n\n(\u22121, 0)\n\n(1, 0, 0, \u22121), (0, 1, 0, \u22121), (0, 0, 1, \u22121)\n\n(0, 1)\n\n(\u22121, 0, 0, 1), (0, \u22121, 0, 1), (0, 0, \u22121, 1)\n\n(0, \u22121)\n\n(0, \u22121, \u22121, 1), (\u22121, 0, \u22121, 1), (\u22121, \u22121, 0, 1) (\u22121, \u22121)\n(0, 1, 1, \u22121), (1, 0, 1, \u22121), (1, 1, 0, \u22121)\n\n(1, 1)\n\n(1, 1, 1, \u22122)\n\n(1, 2)\n\n(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 2)\n\n(\u22121, \u22122)\n\n(0, 0, 0, 1)\n\n(1, \u22121)\n\n(0, 0, 0, \u22121)\n\n(\u22121, 1)\n\n(1, 1, 1, \u22121)\n\n(2, 1)\n\n(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 1)\n\n(\u22122, \u22121)\n\nTable 2: The BPS states associated with a fiber of Kodaira type IV .\n\nThe six BPS states in the first row combine to form a triplet of N = 2 hypermultiplets,\neach of electric charge Qe = 1 and vanishing magnetic charge, in the M4 worldvolume theory\nof the wrapped five\u2013brane. We denote these hypermultiplets by \u03a6i(1,0) , where i = 1, 2, 3.\nSimilarly, the second and third rows each correspond to a triplet of N = 2 hypermultiplets,\nwhich we denote by \u03a6i(0,1) and \u03a6i(\u22121,\u22121) with i = 1, 2, 3 respectively. As indicated by the\nnotation, the multiplet \u03a6i(0,1) has vanishing electric charge and magnetic charge Qm = 1,\nwhereas \u03a6i(\u22121,\u22121) carries both electric charge Qe = \u22121 and magnetic charge Qm = \u22121. The\ntwo BPS states in the fourth row combine to form a single, N = 2 hypermultiplet, \u03a8(1,2)\nwith Qe = 1 and Qm = 2. Finally, the last two rows each correspond to a single N = 2\nhypermultiplet, denoted by \u03a8(1,\u22121) and \u03a8(2,1) , with Qe = 1, Qm = \u22121 and Qe = 2, Qm = 1\nrespectively. The non\u2013BPS states are either unstable or massive. When the deformation\nthat split the IV fiber is undone, all these BPS multiplets become simultaneously massless\n36\n\n\fas the fivebrane is moved towards the IV fiber. These states have mutually non-local (p, q)\ncharges, meaning that they can not be made simultaneously purely electric by an SL(2, Z)\ntransformation. This leads to a very exotic low energy theory without a local Lagrangian\ndescription. Such theories were obtained originally, in a different context, in [31, 32, 33].\nWhen the fivebrane wraps the type IV Kodaira fiber, the low energy theory flows to an\ninteracting fixed point in the infrared.\n\n(p,q)\n\nn2\n\nn1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nn4\n\nn3\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 6: A string junction for a split type IV Kodaira fiber.

Define classes\n1\nw\n~ p = (v1 + v2 + v3 ),\n3\n\n1\nw\n~ q = (v1 + v2 + v3 ) \u2212 v4\n3\n\n(4.44)\n\nand\n1\n1\nw\n~ 1 = (2v1 \u2212 v2 \u2212 v3 ),\nw\n~ 2 = (v1 + v2 \u2212 2v3 )\n3\n3\nThen, in terms of these classes, J~ can be written as\nJ~ = pw\n~ p + qw\n~ q + ai w\n~i\n\n(4.45)\n\n(4.46)\n\nwhere p and q are given in (4.42) and\na1 = n1 \u2212 n2 ,\n\na2 = n2 \u2212 n3\n37\n\n(4.47)\n\n\fIt is useful to proceed one step further and write equation (4.46) as\nJ~ = pw\n~ p + qw\n~ q + ai C \u22121ij \u03b1\n~i\n\n(4.48)\n\nwhere \u03b1\n~ 1 = 2w 1 \u2212 w 2 , \u03b1\n~ 2 = \u2212w 1 + 2w 2 and Cij = \u2212~\n\u03b1i * \u03b1\n~ j . Note that\n\u03b1\n~ 1 = v1 \u2212 v2 ,\n\n\u03b1\n~ 2 = v2 \u2212 v3\n\n(4.49)\n\nwhich are both associated with the cycle (p, q) = (0, 0) and, hence, each corresponds to no\nboundary cycle at all. Therefore, \u03b1\n~ 1 is described by curves from discriminant point 1 to\ndiscriminant point 2 and \u03b1\n~ 2 is described by curves from discriminant point 2 to discriminant\npoint 3, as shown in Figure 6. Furthermore, it follows from (4.39) that\n!\n2 \u22121\nCij =\n\u22121 2\n\n(4.50)\n\nwhich is the Cartan matrix of the Lie algebra of SU(3). Hence, the classes \u03b1\n~ 1 and \u03b1\n~ 2 correspond to the simple roots of the SU(3). Note that, written as a four\u2013tuplet [n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 ],\nclass \u03b1\n~ 1 = [1, \u22121, 0, 0] and class \u03b1\n~ 2 = [0, 1, \u22121, 0].\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b11\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 7: The two simple roots of SU (3), realized as string junctions for the split Kodaira type\nIV fiber. Note that there are no root junctions with an endpoint on the fourth I1 fiber.\n\nConsider, for example, the six BPS states in the first row of Table 2, and note that\n[1, 0, 0, 0] \u2212 \u03b1\n~ 1 = [0, 1, 0, 0],\n[\u22121, 0, 0, 0] + \u03b1\n~ 1 = [0, \u22121, 0, 0],\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0] \u2212 \u03b1\n~ 2 = [0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n(4.51)\n\n[0, \u22121, 0, 0] + \u03b1\n~ 2 = [0, 0, \u22121, 0]\n\n(4.52)\n\nFurther addition or subtraction of the roots leads to non\u2013BPS states that are either unstable\nor massive. Hence, the pairs of BPS states ([1, 0, 0, 0], [\u22121, 0, 0, 0]), ([0, 1, 0, 0], [0, \u22121, 0, 0])\nand ([0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, \u22121, 0]) combine to form the hypermultiplets \u03a61(1,0) , \u03a62(1,0) and \u03a63(1,0) respectively. Furthermore, these hypermultiplets form a triplet 3 representation of SU(3). The\n38\n\n\fsame is true for the hypermultiplets \u03a6i(0,1) and \u03a6i(\u22121,\u22121) for i = 1, 2, 3, each of which transforms as an SU(3) 3 representation. Now consider the two BPS states in the fourth row of\nTable 2. Addition or subtraction of any root leads immediately to non\u2013BPS states which\nare either unstable of massive. Hence, the pair of BPS states ([1, 1, 1, \u22122], [\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 2])\ncombine to form a hypermultiplet \u03a8(1,2) , which is a singlet under SU(3). The same is true\nfor \u03a8(1,\u22121) and \u03a8(2,1) which are both SU(3) singlets. The appearance of the global group\nSU(3) can be read off directly from the A-D-E column of Table 1. For Kodaira type IV ,\nthe A-D-E classification is A2 , which corresponds to the group SU(3).\nWe conclude that, near a point on a smooth part of the discriminant curve with elliptic\nfiber of Kodaira type IV , the M4 worldvolume theory of a wrapped five\u2013brane has N = 2\nsupersymmetry at low energy. In addition to the \"standard\" Abelian Yang\u2013Mills supermultiplet with gauge connection A\u03bc and an uncharged hypermultiplet, the IV degeneracy of the\nelliptic fiber produces light BPS hypermultiplets.

The associated global symmetry group is SO(8). The low\n39\n\n\fenergy theory that arises in the neighborhood of an I0\u2217 fiber is the same as that of an N = 2,\nSU(2) Yang\u2013Mills theory with four quark flavors. The BPS multiplets in the I0\u2217 case can be\neasily found by comparing to Yang-Mills theory results [29, 30], or by using string junctions\nas in [27]. The results are summarized in the table below.\n\n(p, q) charges\n\nSO(8) representation\n\n(2n, 2m)\n\n1\n\n(2n + 1, 2m)\n\n8v\n\n(2n, 2m + 1)\n\n8s\n\n(2n + 1, 2m + 1)\n\n8c\n\nTable 3: The BPS multiplets associated with a fiber of Kodaira type I0\u2217 .\n\nTable 3 is to be read as follows. For each n and m, there is an N = 2 multiplet with the (p, q)\ncharges listed in the first column, which transforms in the representation of SO(8) listed in\nthe last column. In the first row, n and m are constrained to be relatively prime, whereas in\nthe remaining rows, p and q must be relatively prime. There are no further constraints. Note\nthat, in analogy to the Kodaira type IV case, there are a finite number of representations\nof SO(8) which appear, specifically singlets and octets only. However, unlike the type IV\ncase, each of these representations occurs with infinite multiplicity. Of course not all of these\nmultiplets are simultaneously stable, depending on the location of the five\u2013brane in moduli\nspace.\nLet us summarize these results in terms of N = 2 supermultiplets. In addition to the\n\"standard\" Abelian vector supermultiplet with gauge connection A\u03bc and an uncharged hypermultiplet, the I0\u2217 degeneracy of the elliptic fiber produces light BPS hyper- and vector\nmultiplets. The extra vector multiplets are SO(8) singlets with p = \u00b12 and q = 0\n\u2022 V\u00b1\nAs the five\u2013brane approaches the discriminant curve, these combine with the usual uncharged\nAbelian vector multiplet to form massless N = 2 vector multiplets Va which transform as\nthe adjoint representation of an enhanced SU(2) gauge group. The remaining states belong\nto hypermultiplets\n\u2022 \u03a6i(p,q)\n\nQe = p, Qm = q\n40\n\n\fwhere the charges (p, q) and the SO(8) representation multiplets i are given in Table 3. As\nthe five\u2013brane approaches the discriminant curve, the hypermultiplets transforming as 8v\nunder SO(8) with q = 0 combine to form an SU(2) doublet 2, QiA , where i is the index\nof the 8v representation and A = 1, 2. These correspond to hypermultiplets of four SU(2)\ndoublet quark flavors.\nThe A-D-E symmetry algebras associated with fibers of Kodaira type III \u2217 and IV \u2217 can\nbe read off from Table 1. The associated global symmetry groups are the exceptional groups\nE7 and E6 respectively. The complete spectrum of BPS multiplets for these two Kodaira\ntypes are much harder to determine, for reasons discussed below, and we will present only\npartial results [27]. First, note from Table 4 in the Appendix that the monodromy associated\nwith a Kodaira fiber of type I0\u2217 decomposes into type I1 monodromies as AAAABC. Similarly, one sees that Kodaira fibers of type III \u2217 and IV \u2217 decompose as AAAAAABCC and\nAAAAABCC respectively. It follows that the I0\u2217 string junction lattice is a sublattice of the\nIII \u2217 and IV \u2217 junction lattices. This reflects the fact that a fiber of type I0\u2217 may be obtained\nfrom type III \u2217 or type IV \u2217 fibers by deformations of the discriminant curve; one simply\nmoves some of the I1 fibers in the decomposition of the III \u2217 or IV \u2217 to infinity, leaving only\nthe I1 fibers which make up the I0\u2217 . For instance, the IV \u2217 fiber decomposes into I1 fibers\nof monodromy type AAAAABCC. By moving one I1 of type A and another of type C to\ninfinity, one is left with I1 fibers of monodromy type AAAABC, which is the decomposition\nof an I0\u2217 fiber. It follows from this that each of the I0\u2217 BPS multiplets listed in Table 3 is also a\nBPS multiplet of both the Kodaira type III \u2217 and type IV \u2217 fibers. However, it turns out that\nI0\u2217 multiplets with different (p, q) charges transforming in the same representation of SO(8),\ntransform as different representations of the exceptional groups of the Kodaira fibers III \u2217\nand IV \u2217 . For example [27], the 8v appearing for the I0\u2217 fiber with charges (p, q) = (1, 0) is\nembedded in a 56 of E7 , or a 27 of E6 , while the 8v with charges (p, q) = (1, 2) is embedded\nin a 27664 of E7 , or a 351 of E6 . Consequently, although the type I0\u2217 BPS multiplets with\n(p, q) charges listed in Table 3 are also BPS multiplets of type III \u2217 and type IV \u2217 fibers, they\nare classified by an infinite number of different E7 and E6 representations. Although these\ncan be computed on a case by case basis, a simple listing of such multiplets is impossible. In\naddition, there are BPS multiplets associated with both type III \u2217 and type IV \u2217 fibers that\nare unrelated to those of the I0\u2217 . These multiplets arise from string junctions involving the\ntype A and type C I1 fibers not contained in the decomposition of I0\u2217 . We will not discuss\nthese states here, referring the interested reader to [27]. Again, one expects BPS states with\nmutually non-local charges to become simultaneously massless as the five-brane approaches\n41\n\n\fthe singular fiber. The low energy theory on the five-brane wrapping the singular fiber flows\nto an exotic interacting fixed point theory. The fixed point theories with exceptional global\nsymmetries were first discussed, in a different context, in [33].\n\n5\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this paper, we have presented detailed techniques for computing the discriminant curves\nof elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. These were applied to a specific three\u2013family,\nSU(5) GUT model of particle physics within the context of Heterotic M\u2013Theory. In this theory, and in general, the discriminant curves have an intricate structure, consisting of smooth\nsections, cusps and tangential and normal self\u2013intersections. The type of degeneration of the\nelliptic fiber, classified by Kodaira, changes in the different regions of the discriminant curve.\nIn this paper, we discussed how to find the Kodaira type of the fiber singularities and explicitly computed them for the discriminant curves associated with the SU(5) GUT model. In\nHeterotic M\u2013Theory, anomaly cancellation generically requires the existence of five\u2013branes,\nlocated in the bulk space, wrapped on a holomorphic curve in the associated Calabi\u2013Yau\nthreefold. We showed that there is always a region of the moduli space of this holomorphic\ncurve that corresponds a single five\u2013brane wrapped on a pure fiber elliptic curve. Since this\nfiber degenerates as it approaches the discriminant curve, one expects light BPS states to\nappear in the worldvolume theory of this five\u2013brane. For points on the smooth parts of the\ndiscriminant curve, we demonstrated in detail how the M\u2013theory membranes associated with\nthese states are, when projected into the base space, related to string junction lattices. Using\nstring junction techniques, we computed the massless BPS hyper- and vector multiplets for\nall the Kodaira type degeneracies that occur in our specific SU(5) GUT model. The Kodaira\ntheory, as well as the computation of light states, is considerably more intricate at the cusp\nand self\u2013intersection points of the discriminant curve. These topics will be discussed in a\nforthcoming publication.\nIt is important to note that the solutions of the BPS constraint on string junctions\nonly gives a list of the possible BPS states in the spectrum. Determining their stability at\ndifferent points in moduli space is a dynamical question, and the answer is not completely\nknown for the exceptional Kodaira types. The answer is known for the non\u2013exceptional\nKodaira degeneracies, including the types I1 , I2 , IV and I0\u2217 discussed in this paper [29, 30].\nIn the I0\u2217 case, the states listed in Table 3 all appear in the stable spectrum at different\npoints in moduli space. It follows that the multiplets of the exceptional groups E7 and E6\n42\n\n\finto which these states are embedded also exist in the spectrum. However, nothing is known\nabout the stability of the multiplets which decouple upon deforming the exceptional fibers\ninto I0\u2217 .\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank P. Candelas, D.

There, string junctions were discussed in the context of type IIB string theory\non CP1 . As described in this paper, membrane junctions in an elliptically fibered surface in\nM\u2013theory become string junctions when projected into the base.\nThe equivalence classes of string junctions form a lattice with a quadratic form. To\ndefine the junction lattice, one initially splits all Kodaira fibers into a number of type I1\nfibers by a suitable deformation of the Weierstrass model (a \"relevant deformation\"). The\nstring junctions lie in the base space. The I1 loci are points in the base and the string\njunctions start from a fixed point P away from these loci and may end only at the I1 points.\nEach segment of the junction is an oriented string with charges (p, q), which are conserved\nat branching points. The charges (p, q) correspond to a one\u2013cycle in the associated elliptic\nfiber F over the point P . The segment of a string junction ending at an I1 locus has charges\nwhich are proportional to the vanishing cycle (pi , qi ) for the i-th I1 fiber. The vanishing cycle\nis the eigenvector of the monodromy matrix\n\nMi =\n\n1 \u2212 pi qi\n\np2i\n\n\u2212qi2\n\n1 + pi qi\n\n!\n\n(6.1)\n\nIn a convenient decomposition [26], any Kodaira fiber may be split into I1 fibers on the real\naxis each with vanishing cycles (1, 0), (1, \u22121), or (1, 1). The associated monodromy matrices\n43\n\n\fare, using (6.1), given by\nA=\n\n1 1\n0 1\n\n!\n\n,\n\nB=\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u22121 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\nC=\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22121 2\n\n!\n\n(6.2)\n\nrespectively. The decompositions of the general Kodaira type fibers into I1 fibers, from left\nto right on the real axis, are listed below.\n\nKodaira type\n\ndecomposition\n\nIn\n\nAn\n\nII\n\nAB\n\nIII\n\nAAB\n\nIV\n\nAAAB\n\nIn\u2217\n\nA4+n BC\n\nIV \u2217\n\nAAAAABCC\n\nIII \u2217\n\nAAAAAABCC\n\nII \u2217\n\nAAAAAAABCC\n\nTable 4: The decomposition of Kodaira fibers into type I1 fibers and the associated\nmonodromy.\n\nThe basis cycles on the elliptic fiber are not globally defined, and there are branch cuts\nwhich may be taken to extend vertically downward from each I1 loci. As a segment of the\nstring junction crosses the branch cut of the i-th I1 locus, the (pi , qi ) charges labeling the\ncycle over this segment are acted on by the monodromy Mi . Such a segment can be pulled\nacross the I1 locus so that it no longer crosses the branch cut. However, because of a HananyWitten effect, an additional segment appears stretching between the original segment and the\nI1 locus, as illustrated in Figure 8. The charges of the new segment are determined by charge\nconservation to be (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) = Mi (p, q) \u2212 (p, q), which is proportional to the vanishing cycle\n(pi , qi ). The two junctions related by pulling this segment across the I1 locus are equivalent.\nThus, the equivalence classes of junctions can be determined by considering only junctions\nwhich have no components below the real axis, as in Figure 8(b).1 The equivalence classes\nP\nare then labeled by vectors J~ = i ni~vi , where the integers ni indicate that the charges of\n1\n\nAlternatively: One would like to write the vanishing cycle (p, q) for any path \u0393, which starts from P and\n\n44\n\n\fthe segment ending on the i-th I1 locus are ni (pi , qi ). The dimension of the string junction\nlattice is equal to the number of I1 fibers. The reader is referred to [26] for details on the\nconstruction of the quadratic intersection form on the junction lattice. Here, we simply state\nthe results. The intersection form is given by\n~vi * ~vi = \u22121\n1\n~vi * ~vj = (pi qj \u2212 qi pj ),\n2\n\n(6.3)\n\ni 6= j\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe basis in which an equivalence class J~ is labeled by the integers ni is not the most\nuseful one. There is another basis in which the gauge and global symmetry charges appear\nexplicitly. Viewed as quantum numbers of a BPS state, the electric and magnetic charges\nP\nof a string junction are (p, q) = i ni (pi , qi ). The remaining directions in the lattice are\nrelated to global symmetry charges. Using the intersection form on the lattice, one can show\nthat the junction lattice contains the weight lattice of a (simply laced) Lie algebra [26]. The\nsimple roots of the Lie algebra correspond to a basis set of string junctions with vanishing\ncharges (p, q) = (0, 0), and have self\u2013intersection \u22122. The intersection matrix of the simple\nroot junctions \u03b1\n~ i is minus the Cartan matrix of the Lie algebra\n\u03b1\n~i * \u03b1\n~ j = \u2212Cij .\n\n(6.5)\n\nWhen I1 fibers coalesce to form another Kodaira fiber, some root junctions have vanishing\nlength. The Lie algebra associated with these simple roots generates a global symmetry\nof the theory which matches the A-D-E type of the Kodaira fiber. Fundamental weight\njunctions w\n~ i with vanishing (p, q) charges are defined by w\n~i * \u03b1\n~ j = \u2212\u03b4ji , and are related to\nthe simple root junctions by\nw\n~ i = C \u22121ij \u03b1\n~ j.\n\n(6.6)\n\nThe fundamental weight junctions are \"improper\" in the sense that the ni associated with\nthem are not integers. To get a complete basis, one defines another pair of string junctions\nends at one I1 point Q, as a suitable sum of our basic vanishing cycles. This sum should uniquely identify\na class of string junctions in the base. In fact, \u0393 can be decomposed into a product of simple loops around\neach I1 point and a simple path to Q (that is a path which is homotopically trivial in the complement of the\nI1 points in the base). The composition of the corresponding monodromy matrices applied to the cycle (p, q)\nis a multiple of the vanishing cycle for the point Q. Now because Mi (r, s) \u2212 (r, s) is always proportional to\nthe vanishing cycle (pi , qi ), for all i and (r, s), we can show that the vanishing cycle for the path \u0393 has the\nexpected form.\n\n45\n\n\fw\n~ p and w\n~ q . These are orthogonal to the fundamental weight junctions w\n~ i and carry total\ncharges (p, q) = (1, 0) and (0, 1) respectively. The junctions w\n~ p and w\n~ q are also improper.\nAny proper junction J~ can be written as\nJ~ = pw\n~ p + qw\n~ q + ai w\n~ i.\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere the integers ai are the Dynkin labels. The weights in a BPS representation consist of\njunctions J~ related by the addition of simple roots, and satisfying the BPS condition [27, 28]\nJ~ * J~ \u2265 \u22122 + gcd(p, q),\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere gcd denotes the greatest common positive divisor of p and q.\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 8: Two equivalent string junction lattices.
