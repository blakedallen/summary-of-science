The energy gap of optimally doped Bi2(Sr,R)2CuOy (R=La and Eu) was\nprobed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) using a vacuum\nultraviolet laser (photon energy 6.994 eV) or He I\u03b1 resonance line (21.218 eV) as\nphoton source.

However, an\nabrupt deviation from the d-wave gap function and an opposite R dependence for the\ngap size were observed around the antinode, which represent a clear disentanglement\nbetween the antinodal pseudogap and the nodal superconducting gap.\n1. Introduction\nOne of the fundamental issues in cuprate superconductors is clarifying the nature and origin of the\npseudogap [1,2]. In Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy, the superconducting transition temperature Tc at optimal doping\ndecreases with the decrease in the ionic radius of R and the carrier range where superconductivity\ntakes place becomes narrower [3-6]. This system, hence, provides us with different routes to unveil the\nrelation between pseudogap and superconductivity since Tc can be varied not only by changing doping\nbut also at fixed doping [7,8].\nOur previous work of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy\n(R=La and Eu) using 21.218 eV photon from He I\u03b1 resonance line has shown that the antinodal\npseudogaps of Eu-doped samples (lower Tc) persist up to higher temperatures than La-doped samples\n(higher Tc) when compared at same doping [7]. Further, the momentum range where a clear peak was\nobserved in the spectrum of optimally doped R=La and Eu samples in the superconducting state were\nrestricted to around the node forming arc-like areas, and the length of the arc was shorter for the\nEu-doped sample [8]. All these findings can be naturally understood by a competition between high\ntemperature superconductivity and the pseudogap that is formed around the antinode [7,8].\nIn recent years, it has been a focus of interest if the superconducting state can be characterized by a\nsingle gap function or by two gaps that are co-existing in momentum space [1,2,9-15]. To resolve the\n\n\fcontroversy provoked by earlier studies and to increase our understanding on the nature of the gap\nfunction in the superconducting state, we studied here how the gap function of Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy depends\non R at fixed doping. If the antinodal pseudogap subsists in the superconducting state and the gap\nfunction is composed by two energy gaps, we expect that the magnitudes of these two gaps have a\ndifferent R dependence because of the competition between pseudogap and high-Tc superconductivity,\nand we may disentangle the two gaps.\n2. Experimental details\nWe used optimally doped single crystals of Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy (R=La and Eu) grown from\npolycrystalline rods that had a nominal composition of Bi2Sr1.65R0.35CuOy with the same growth\ncondition reported previously [6]. The crystals of this study were obtained by cleaving from the same\ndomain as the samples used in the previous work using 21.218 eV photon from He I\u03b1 resonance line\n[8]. As shown in fig. 1(a), Tc of the samples were 33 K and 18 K for R=La and Eu, respectively, which\ncorrespond to their optimal Tc values [6,8].\nThe momentum dependence of the energy gap near the antinode was determined from the\npreviously acquired data using 21.218 eV photons [8]. However, for the gap around the node, which is\nexpected to be very small due to the low Tc of the present material, the energy resolution was not\nsufficient. Therefore, high resolution ARPES spectra were accumulated at the Institute of Solid State\nPhysics (ISSP) using a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer combined with an ultraviolet laser (h\u03bd=6.994\neV) as the incident light [16]. All measurements were performed at pressures below 5 \u00d7 10-11 Torr and\nat 5 K, low enough compared to Tc of the samples. The energy resolution for the laser ARPES\nmeasurement was about 2 meV.\n\nFigure 1. (a) Temperature dependence of magnetization (field cooling).

(f), (g) Energy distribution curves (EDCs) (left) and the EDCs symmetrized at\nthe Fermi energy (right) of the R=La and Eu samples, respectively. The kF points where the EDCs\nwere measured are shown in (b) and (c).\n\n\f3. Results and discussion\nFig. 1(b) and (c) show the intensity maps of the ARPES spectra integrated within \u00b11 meV from the\nFermi energy EF for the R=La and Eu samples, respectively. Fig. 1(d) and (e) show the ARPES spectra\nalong the momentum cuts indicated in fig. 1(b) and (c). The ARPES spectra around the node of both\nsamples are sharp while it becomes more blurred at momentum away from the node. This is a common\nfeature of the ARPES spectra of cuprate superconductors. Fig. 1(f) and (g) show the energy\ndistribution curves (EDCs) and those symmetrized at EF at various Fermi momentum kF. The kF values\nwhere these EDCs were measured are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). One can see that a gap is opened\nexcept at the node and the size increases as moving toward the antinode. This momentum dependence\nis characteristic to a d-wave gap function with a point node. Interestingly, the spectral weight of the\nsymmetrized curve tends to be more filled in for the Eu-doped sample compared with the La-doped\none at the same momentum.\nFig. 2(a) shows the momentum dependence of the energy gap. The gap size here was defined as half\nof the peak-to-peak separation of the symmetrized EDCs. We have included in fig. 2(a) the data\ndetermined from the previously acquired ARPES spectra using 21.218 eV photon source at 8 K [8]\nwhile the symmetrized EDCs of those spectra are shown in fig. 2(b) and (c). One can see from the\ninset of fig. 2(a) that the gap sizes around the node of both samples change linearly as a function of\ncos2\u03b8, where \u03b8 represents the Fermi angle defined in fig. 2(b). This means that the gap around the\nnode can be well described with a monotonic d-wave function at least at 5 K. The gap around the node\nwas larger for the La-doped sample that has a higher Tc. All these results indicate that the nodal gap is\nconnected to superconductivity.\nOn the contrary to the node, the gap size near the antinode of the Eu-doped sample was larger than\nthat of the La-doped sample as shown in fig. 2(a), which means that the gap function has an opposite R\ndependence around the node and near the antinode. It is hence obvious that the gap function in the\nsuperconducting state consists of two components that change in a different way when Tc is altered at\nfixed doping. In our previous study, the antinodal gap in the normal state was found to persist up to\n\nFigure 2. (a) Momentum dependence of the gap size in the superconducting states of the R=La and\nEu samples. The data determined from the previously acquired spectra using 21.218 eV photon\nsource [8] are also included. The inset shows the data in an expanded view.

The kF\npositions where these spectra were taken are shown in the upper figures.\n\n\fhigher temperatures for Eu-doped samples when compared with La-doped samples at same doping,\nwhich is opposite to the R dependence of Tc and implies that pseudogap is competing with high-Tc\nsuperconductivity [7]. Here we observed that the gap size around the node changes in accordance with\nthe change of Tc, while it has an opposite R dependence near the antinode. Therefore, it is natural to\nconsider that the pseudogap observed in the normal state is robust and persists also in the\nsuperconducting state.\nFinally we would like to mention that although the magnitude of the nodal gap changes in\naccordance with the change of Tc, the change is much smaller compared to the Tc difference. This\nmeans that Tc is not solely determined by the gap size around the node. Rather, the gap around the\nantinode shows a much larger change. A quantitative study to unveil the parameter that determines Tc\nin this system would be necessary in the future.\n4. Conclusions\nWe observed that the energy gap around the node and antinode depend on Tc in an opposite way in\nthe superconducting state of optimally doped Bi2Sr2-xRxCuOy with R=La and Eu by measuring the\nmomentum dependence of the energy gap. This result can be understood by considering two different\ngaps. One is related to superconductivity and is prominent in the ARPES spectra taken around the\nnode, and the other one around the antinode is the pseudogap that competes with superconductivity.\nPrior to the submission of this paper, we came aware that Hashimoto et al. submitted very recently a\nsimilar result about the R dependence of the gap function in the superconducting state [17].\nReferences\n[1] M.
