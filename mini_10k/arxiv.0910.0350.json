Introduction\nWhy study inhomogeneous models? The real universe is very lumpy. To properly understand\nwhat we see, we should apply all possible methods: perturbation theory, N -body newtonian simulations, and exact inhomogeneous metrics - each has its domain of validity. Inhomogeneous\nmetrics have the advantage that they are fully non-linear and relativistic solutions of the Einstein\nfield equations (EFEs).\nThe assumption of homogeneity has become so well established, that it has become allpervasive. But now, with so much data coming in, it's time to test homogeneity. Cosmological\ndata reduction relies heavily on the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric - we need to beware of a circular argument. It will be a significant challenge to check which of our well-known results actually\ndepend on the assumption of homogeneity, and to re-derive them all without that assumption.\nHere I will present a selection of results in inhomogeneous cosmology, especially work done\nwith Lu, McClure, Krasi\u0144ski, Bolejko, C\u00e9l\u00e9rier, Alfedeel, Mustapha, Ellis and others, but I won't\ntry to be comprehensive. I'll attempt to provide the basics, and thereby promote the use of inhomogeneous metrics for the study of cosmological problems.\nInhomogeneous metrics will become more important as the amount and accuracy of cosmological data increases, and more precise analysis is needed, so there are plenty of opportunities for\ngood research.\n\n2. The Lema\u00eetre-Tolman Metric\nThe Lema\u00eetre-Tolman (LT) metric was the first inhomogeneous non-vacuum metric to be discovered, and has probably been the most popular choice for modelling cosmic inhomogeneity ever\nsince, certainly in recent decades. It is a spherically-symmetric, inhomogeneous dust model, discovered by Lema\u00eetre, rediscovered by Tolman, and studied by Bondi [84, 115, 23]. The metric\nis\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\n\n(R\u2032 )2 2\ndr + R2 d\u03a92 ,\n1+f\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 = d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 , R(t, r) is the areal radius, and R\u2032 = \u2202R/\u2202r. The free function f (r)\ndetermines the local geometry; it gives the \"embedding angle\" of constant t, \u03b8 surfaces in 3-d flat\nspace [51]. Also the Ricci scalar of the spatial 3-surfaces,\n3\n\nR=\n\n\u22122(Rf \u2032 + f R\u2032)\n,\nR2 R\u2032\n\n(2.2)\n\nis only zero (for all r) if both f and f \u2032 are zero. The matter is a pressure-free perfect fluid,\nT ab = \u03c1ua ub ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nua = \u03b4ta .\n\n(2.4)\n\nthat is comoving\n\n2\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nFrom the EFEs we get\n\u1e582 =\n\n2M\n\u039bR2\n+f +\n,\nR\n3\n\n(2.5)\n\n2M \u2032\n,\nR2 R\u2032\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u1e58 = \u2202R/\u2202t, and\n\u03ba\u03c1 =\n\nwhere M (r) is a second free function that gives the gravitational mass within a comoving shell of\nradius r. Here f (r) also plays the role of twice the local energy per unit mass of the dust particles,\nso it's often written f (r) = 2E(r).

(Near the origin, where f \u2192 0, the\ntype of evolution is determined by the sign of Rf /M or f /M 2/3 .) When \u039b 6= 0 there is a very complicated solution in terms of elliptic integrals. These solutions contain a third free function a(r),\nwhich is the local time of the big bang, the time when R = 0 on each worldline. In other words,\nthe constant r worldlines all emerge from the bang at different times, usually the outer spheres first\nand the origin last, as illustrated in the sketches below.\nt\n\nt crunch\n\ncrunch\n\nEvolving worldlines\n\nComoving worldlines\n\nR\n\nr\n\nInner worldlines emerge later\nbang\n\nbang\n\nThe above evolutions equation and solutions may also be written\n\u03b2\u0307 =\n\n2\n\u039b\u03b12\n+x+\n,\n\u03b1\n3\n3\n\n(2.12)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n\u039b = 0, f > 0 :\n\u039b = 0, f = 0 :\n\u039b = 0, f < 0, 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c0 :\n\u039b = 0, f < 0, \u03c0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 2\u03c0 :\n\nnp\no\nt = a + x\u22123/2\n(1 + x\u03b1)2 \u2212 1 \u2212 arcosh(1 + x\u03b1) , (2.13)\n\u221a\n2\u03b13\n,\n(2.14)\nt = a+\n3 n\no\np\nt = a + x\u22123/2 arccos(1 + x\u03b1) \u2212 1 \u2212 (1 + x\u03b1)2 , (2.15)\nn\no\np\nt = a + x\u22123/2 2\u03c0 \u2212 arccos(1 + x\u03b1) + 1 \u2212 (1 + x\u03b1)2 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b1=\n\nR\n,\nM 1/3\n\nx=\n\n|f |\n,\nM 2/3\n\n\u03b2=\n\n\u1e58\n.\nM 1/3\n\n(2.17)\n\nNaturally, the time reverses of these models, obtained by changing (t \u2212 a) to (a \u2212 t) and a\u2032 to\n\u2212a\u2032 , are also solutions. It is quite possible to have adjacent elliptic and hyperbolic regions in\none model - for example, a re-collapsing dust cloud could be surrounded by an ever-expanding\nuniverse. The two regions would have a parabolic shell at the boundary between them, but extended\nparabolic regions are also possible. In practice, (2.9), (2.11), (2.13), (2.15), (2.16) are not good for\ncalculating the evolution of worldlines that are close to parabolic, so a series expansion is used\ninstead. Similarly, near the bang or crunch, where the evolution is close to parabolic, one obtains\nbetter accuracy by using the same series expansion.\nIt is sometimes useful to have an expression for R\u2032 .

Between them they provide a radial co-ordinate freedom and two physical relationships, e.g. M = M (r), f = f (M ) and a = a(M ), though it is normal to give all of them in terms\nof r. It is not possible to give any kind of standard form for one of these functions that will cover\nall possibilities. For example, the choice M \u221d r 3 is common, but does not allow regions of vacuum\n4\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nwhere M \u2032 = 0; a standard choice for f (r) cannot include both models in which f changes sign,\nand those in which it doesn't; and similarly no choice of a(r) can cover cases where a is constant\nin some places and cases where it never is.\nSee [74] for a survey of work done on inhomogeneous models up to 1997, [101] for an introduction to some inhomogeneous models, and [20] for a summary of some recent developments. A\ndynamical systems analysis is given in [109].\n2.1 Singularities\nSingularities occur where the density (2.6) or the curvature diverge. The Kretschmann scalar\nis\nK = Rabcd Rabcd =\n\n48M 2 32M M \u2032 12(M \u2032 )2\n+\n+ 4 \u2032 2 .\nR6\nR5 R\u2032\nR (R )\n\n(2.24)\n\nBig Bang At the big bang or the big crunch, we have R = 0, which occurs where t = a or where\nt = a + 2\u03c0 T\u0303 . Here R\u2032 diverges unless a\u2032 = 0. The bang and crunch surfaces are spacelike [50, 65],\nexcept possibly at the origin.\nShell Crossings Shell crossings are timelike surfaces that occur where an inner spherical\nshell of matter collides with an adjacent outer shell, so that R\u2032 = 0. These surfaces are timelike\n[50, 64], and have a different redshift structure from the bang [63]. Since the r coordinate is\ncomoving, it becomes degenerate at such loci. Physically one might argue that non-zero pressure\nwould develop before a shell crossing occurs, but for a \"fluid\" of many stars or galaxies that doesn't\napply. Clearly shell crossings represent a breakdown of the LT assumptions and for many purposes\nthey are undesireable. Shell crossings can be eliminated from an entire model, in the \u039b = 0 case,\nby applying the conditions found in [50, 64] to the 3 arbitrary functions. These conditions were\nderived by writing R\u2032 in terms of the parameter \u03b7 and looking at the early and late time behaviours.\nThey are important if you want your model to be everywhere well behaved.1\nt\n\nt\nR\nInner worldlines emerge from bang earlier\n\nR\nEnergy not always increasing outwards\n\nHowever, both R = 0 and R\u2032 = 0 can occur at non-singular locations as explained below.\n'Shell Focussing' There are also \"shell focussing\" singularities, e.g. [37, 32, 96, 98, 102, 65,\n116, 83, 49, 85, 81, 72]. For certain LT models, the first event of the big crunch to form, where the\ncentral worldline reaches the crunch surface, can emit many light rays, some of which may even\nreach infinity. (So they might be better called \"light focussing\" singularities.) The nature of the\nsingularity is difficult to understand, and seems to depend on the path of approach to the singular\npoint.\n1\n\nShell crossings have been extensively investigated, e.g. [99, 121, 97, 21]\n\n5\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n2.2 Regularity Conditions\nRegular signature For the metric (2.1) to retain a Lorentzian signature,\nf \u2265 \u22121\n\n(2.25)\n\nis required, the equality only occuring where R\u2032 = 0 - see below.\nRegular Origins An origin of spherical coordinates is a locus ro where\nR(t, ro ) = 0\n\n\u2200 t,\n\n(2.26)\n\nso that \u1e58(t, ro ) = 0, R\u0308(t, ro ) = 0, etc. Obviously one usually wants an origin to be a normal\ntimelike worldline. The conditions for a regular origin are obtained by requiring that, in the limit as\nthe origin is approached, the density and the curvature should not diverge, and the time evolution\nat the origin should be a smooth continuation of it's immediate neighbourhood. See for example\n[68, 94]. It is found that, away from the bang or crunch, on a constant t slice,\nM \u223c R3 ,\n\nf \u223c R2 .\n\n(2.27)\n\nThis may be realised by setting f \u221d M 2/3 , e.g. M \u223c r 3 , f \u223c r 2 , at the origin. Variables \u03b1, x & \u03b2 of\n(2.17) have the advantage that they are non-zero at the origin. If in addition one wants the density\nto be smooth through the origin, i.e. to have zero gradient there, then there are further conditions\n[94], most notably\na\u2032 \u2192 0 .\n\n(2.28)\n\nHowever, there is no singularity if this last one does not hold. Thus, the locus R = 0 includes both\nthe spacelike bang and crunch surfaces, and the timelike origins.\n\nRegular Spatial Extrema Similarly, R\u2032 = 0 includes regular loci as well as singular shell\ncrossings. As pointed out in [122], any spherically symmetric model with closed sptial (t = const.)\nsections, such as the k = +1 Freidmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model, has an origin, a maximum radius, and a second origin - a north pole, an equator and a south pole. At a\n6\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nspatial maximum we obviously have R\u2032 = 0, but we expect the density and curvature to be regular\nat such a locus. This is only possible on a comoving shell, i.e.\nR\u2032 (t, rm ) = 0\n\n\u2200 t.\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe conditions for a regular maximum [64, 26] are that there is no shell crossing and no surface\nlayer, i.e.\nM \u2032 (rm ) = 0 = f \u2032 (rm ) = a\u2032 (rm ) , f (rm ) = \u22121 .\n\n(2.30)\n\nTherefore the LT model may have a number of interesting spatial topologies [64, 51, 78], such as\na black hole in a cosmological background, or a sequence of maxima and minima - \"bellies\" and\n\"necks\". It is also possible to have an elliptic (recollapsing) model that is open.\n2.3 Special Cases\nDust Robertson-Walker The LT metric contains the dust RW metric as the special case\nf \u221d M 2/3 ,\n\na\u2032 = 0 .\n\n(2.31)\n\nPutting this in (2.5) and (2.6) makes \u1e58/M 1/3 and \u03c1 independent of r. In standard RW coordinates,\nM = (\u03ba\u03c10 S03 /6)r 3 , f = \u2212kr 2 , a = 0, R = rS(t), so it is evident that S(t) is the scale factor, and\nf2 = \u2212k ,\n\nM3 =\n\n\u03ba\u03c10 S03\n.\n6\n\n(2.32)\n\nConsequently one may write the LT arbitrary functions in a form that looks like RW plus perturbation, but is exact,\nM = M3 r 3 (1 + M\u0303 (r))\nf = f2 r 2 (1 + f \u0303(r))\n\n(2.33)\n\na = a0 (1 + \u00e3(r)) ,\n\n(2.35)\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere M\u0303 , f \u0303 and \u00e3 may be set to zero at the origin, say. In terms of the RW parameters of the\n'unperturbed' RW model that applies at the origin, we can write\nS=\n\nR\n,\nr\n\nso that\n\nH=\n\n\u1e60\n,\nS\n\nf2 = \u2212k\n\nand of course\n\nS0 =\n\n\u03a9m =\n\u2192\n\n2M3\n,\nS 3H 2\n\nM3 =\n\n\u03a9k =\n\nf2\n,\nS2H 2\n\n\u03a9m0\n2\n2H0 (\u2212k\u03a9k0 )3/2\n\n1\n\u221a\n,\nH0 \u2212k\u03a9k0\n\n,\n\n\u039b = 3\u03a9\u039b H02 .\n\n\u03a9\u039b =\n\n\u039b\n,\n3H 2\n\na0 = 0 ,\n\n(2.36)\n(2.37)\n(2.38)\n\nSchwarzschild The spherical vacuum metric is obtained if M \u2032 = 0, and the different choices\nof f (r) and a(r) cover it with different families of geodesic coordinates. But to get the full\nScwarzschild-Kruskal-Szekeres (SKS) topology requires f = \u22121 and a\u2032 = 0 = f \u2032 so that R\u2032 = 0 at\nthe \"throat\" or \"neck\", and that a decreases and f increases on either side - see [51, 54] for the\ndetails and some plots.\n7\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nf(r)\nr\nf(r)\nAsymptotic\nregion\n\nf = -1\n\nR' = 0\nNeck\n\nAsymptotic\nregion\n\na(r)\n\nDatt-Kantowski-Sachs The Datt [35] models are inhomogeneous Kantowski-Sachs type models, and though often treated as a separate solution with R\u2032 = 0, they are in fact limits of LT models\n[54].\nVaidya In the null limit, when f \u2192 \u221e we get the Vaidya metric that represents incoherent\nradiation emanating from (or converging on) a spherical body [86, 53].\n2.4 Constructing Inhomogeneous Models\nThe most obvious way to construct an LT model is to choose the three arbitrary functions.\nChoosing f (r), for example, works quite well if one is interested in the geometry and topology\nof the model. See [64, 51]. But for many situations, it is not always obvious what the density\ndistribution and evolution will be, given f , M and a. In [110], for example, the use of the density\n\u03c1i (r), the 3-d Ricci scalar 3Ri (r) and the areal radius Ri (r), on an initial surface at t = ti was\nadvocated, and an appendix suggested how 'lumps' and 'voids' in the density and curvature could\nbe prescribed on the initial surface.\nIn place of a(r), one may instead specify Ri = R(ti , r) at some initial time, set \u03b7 = 0 at t = ti\nand re-write (2.11) in the form\ns\n!\nM\n2M\nR=\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b7) + Ri cos \u03b7 +\n\u2212 1 sin \u03b7 ,\n(\u2212f )\n(\u2212f )Ri\ns\n!\nRi\nM\n2M\nsin \u03b7 +\n(\u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7) + \u221a\nt=\n\u2212 1 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b7) ;\n(2.39)\n(\u2212f )Ri\n\u2212f\n(\u2212f )3/2\netc for the other cases, (2.10) & (2.9).\nIf you prefer to think in terms of R, then choose M (Ri ), f (Ri ) and a(Ri ) on an initial surface\nt = ti , and set r = Ri . If \u03c1 = \u03c1i (Ri ) is given, then, again choosing r = Ri ,\nM (Ri ) \u2212 M0 =\n\nZ\n\nRi\nR0\n\n8\n\n\u03ba\u03c1i (R)R2\ndR .\n2\n\n(2.40)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nIf the expansion rate and radius \u1e58i (M ) and Ri (M ) are specified, then by (2.5)\nf (M ) = \u1e58i2 \u2212\n\n2M \u039bRi2\n.\n\u2212\nRi\n3\n\n(2.41)\n\nor if the \u1e58i (M ) and f (M ) are specified, then\n\nor\n\n\u0012q\n\u00131/3\n\u221a\n\u1e582 \u2212 f + X 2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\u221a\n,\n,\nX=\n9M \u039b \u2212 (\u1e58 \u2212 f ) \u2212 9M \u039b\nR(M ) =\n\u039bX\ns\n2M\nR(M ) =\n,\nwhen \u039b = 0 .\n\u1e582 \u2212 f\n\n(2.42)\n(2.43)\n\nInitial and Final Profiles In [76, 77, 61] a number of very useful methods for \u039b = 0 LT models\nwere presented. Since these have been summarised elsewhere [20] we will only outline the basic\nidea here. Rather than specifying all the data on a single 'initial' 3-surface, one may instead specify\nthe density profile \u03c11 on one constant time surface t = t1 and another density profile \u03c12 at a later\ntime t = t2 . There is a well-defined algorithm for finding the LT model that evolves from one to\nthe other.\nSuppose, on the surfaces t = t1 & t = t2 , we specify the density to be \u03c1 = \u03c11 (M ) and \u03c1 =\n\u03c12 (M ), then2 from (2.6),\nZ M\n6\n3\n3\nRi (M ) \u2212 R0 =\ndM , i = 1, 2\n(2.44)\nM0 \u03ba\u03c1i (M )\nand normally we would have R0 = 0 = M0 . We set the coordinate freedom via r = M . Since\nM is constant along each particle worldline, we now know R1 and R2 for each particle. We\nconsider a specific M , and we assume \u1e58(t1 , M ) > 0 and R2 > R1 . By the time t2 , the worldline is\neither hyperbolic and still expanding (HX), elliptic and still expanding (EX), or elliptic and already\ncollapsing (EC). In the HX case, we apply (2.13) and (2.17) at the two times and subtract them:\np\n(1 + x\u03b12 )2 \u2212 1 \u2212 arcosh(1 + x\u03b12 )\np\n\u2212 (1 + x\u03b11 )2 \u2212 1 + arcosh(1 + x\u03b11 ) \u2212 x\u22123/2 (t2 \u2212 t1 ) = \u03c8HX (x) = 0 ,\n(2.45)\n\nwith similar expressions for the other cases. This is solved numerically by the bisection method,\nand for this purpose, a pair of x values that bracket the solution were found. Having obtained\nf = xM 2/3 , a is found by using (2.13) again:\nnp\no\n(1 + x\u03b11 )2 \u2212 1 \u2212 arcosh(1 + x\u03b11 ) .\n(2.46)\na = t1 \u2212 x\u22123/2\nObviously it is important to know which case applies along each worldline. In [76] it was shown\nthat\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0013\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113/2\n2\n\uf8f0\u03c0 \u2212 arccos 1 \u2212 2\u03b11 + 2 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b11\n\uf8fb\n\u2192 EC\n(2.47)\nt2 \u2212 t1 >\n2\n\u03b12\n\u03b12\n\u03b12\n2\n\nIn this case, though, (2.44) would not be well defined if there were vacuum \u03c1i (M ) anywhere, since the range of R\nover which M is constant could be anything.\n\n9\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n\u221a \u0010\n\u0011\n2 3/2\n3/2\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11\nt2 \u2212 t1 <\n3\notherwise\n\n\u2192 HX\n\n(2.48)\n\n\u2192 EX\n\n(2.49)\n\nThe borderlines between these cases require careful treatment, see appendix B of [61]. If R2 < R1\nthen there are 3 more solutions, including the collapsing hyperbolic model - the time reverse of\n(2.13).\nA similar approach may be used if velocity profiles \u1e581 (M ) and \u1e582 (M ) are given at t1 & t2 ,\nof if a density profile is given at one time and a velocity profile at another [77]. There are quite a\nfew other useful options, such as setting the late time density of velocity behaviour, specifying a\nsimultaneous time of maximum expansion, specifying only growing or decaying modes, etc [61].\nApplications of these methods to model a galaxy cluster, a void, a galaxy with a central black\nhole, the Shapley Concentration and the Great Attractor, etc, can be found in [76, 77, 78, 19, 13, 18].\n\n3. Observations in Lema\u00eetre-Tolman Models\nThe assumption that the universe is homogeneous, and thus well-represented by an FLRW\nmodel, has led to a very good understanding of its very large scale features and evolution. But once\nthe cosmological data are sufficiently accurate and complete over a large enough range of redshifts,\nthis assumption should be checked.\nHowever, the assumption of homogeneity pervades so much theoretical and observational\nwork so thoroughly, that there is a real danger of a circular argument. Consequently, any proof\nof homogeneity must ensure it does not rely on results obtained using an assumption of homogeneity. Clearly this will not be a simple task. More precisely, the aim is not only to verify homogeneity\nbut also to quantify it: how much fluctuation is there on each scale?\nThere are a several reasons why spherical symmetry is a good first step towards relaxing the\nhomogeneity assumption: (a) we are at the centre of our past null cone, so it makes sense to consider\nspacetime in terms of spherical co-ordinates about the observer; (b) the universe does seem close\nto isotropic on large scales, but radial homogeneity is not easy to verify because of the finite travel\ntime of light and the miniscule duration over which cosmological observations have been made, so\nit is more urgent to determine the radial variation of the metric; (c) there is no deep all-sky redshift\nsurvey at present, and the zone of avoidance is likely to be a gap in any survey for the foreseeable\nfuture; (d) it keeps the theory and numerics tractable while the basics are sorted out. Of course, in\nthe long run, the assumption of spherical symmetry will be dropped.\nHere we derive the observational relations that would be expected in an LT model with given\narbitrary functions. This is also known as the 'forward problem'. Below we focus on a central\nobserver, though non-central observers have also been considered.\n3.1 Observables and Source Evolution\nThe observables we shall use are those for which the dataset is already substantial and will\nin the near future become extensive, the redshift z, the number density in redshift space n(z), the\napparent luminosity and angular diameter l(z) & \u03b4(z). Connected with each of these is a source\nproperty, the peculiar velocity \u03b6, the mass per source \u03bc(z) the absolute luminosity L(z) and the\ntrue diameter D(z).\n10\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nThe redshift z is\nz=\n\n\u03bbo\n\u22121\n\u03bbe\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03bbo and \u03bbe are the observed and emitted wavelengths. The diameter and luminosity3 distances\nare\nr\nD\nL\n,\ndL =\nd10 = 10(m\u2212m\u0303)/5 d10 ,\n(3.2)\ndD =\n\u03b4\nl\nwhere \u03b4 and l are the angular diameter and apparent luminosity of a source, D(z) and L(z) are\nthe corresponding true diameter and absolute luminosity, m and m\u0303 are the apparent and absolute\nmagnitudes, and d10 is 10 parsecs. The two distances are related by the reciprocity theorem [44,\n100, 39],\n(1 + z)2 dD = dL .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe Hubble and deceleration constants are obtained from the slope and concavity of the dL (z) plot\nat the origin,\nddL\ndz\n1\u2212\n\n1\n,\nH0\n\n(3.4)\n\n= q0 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\n=\nz=0\n\n1 d2 dL\nH0 dz 2\n\nz=0\n\nand a common observational definition of H(z) and q(z), based on the FLRW model, is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\n1\ndL\n1\n=p\n,\n(3.6)\nH\n1 + \u03a9k (H0 dL /(1 + z))2 dz (1 + z)\n(1 + z) dH\nq=\n\u22121 .\n(3.7)\nH dz\nFor general non-homogeneous models, there is no obvious general definition of H(z) or q(z), and\na number have been proposed. In any case, what matters is the relation between the model and\nobservations.\nIf in a redshift survey of the sky, dN sources are observed to lie between z and z + dz within\nsolid angle d\u03c9 = sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6, then the redshift-space mass density is\n2\u03c3\u0302\n\u03bc dN\n= \u03bcn =\n(3.8)\n\u03ba\nd\u03c9 dz\nwhere n is the redshift space number density and \u03bc is the mean mass per source. For a treatment\nwhich considers several different source types and observations at different wavelengths see [56].\nA significant feature of these definitions is that each observable, \u03b4, l and n, is associated with a\nsource property, D, L and \u03bc, which have certainly evolved over cosmological timescales. The latter\nare much harder to determine observationally, and studies of their values and evolution invariably\nassume a homogeneous RW model in which to do the analysis. However, if we eventually want to\nprove that the universe is homogeneous, it is imperative to avoid a circular argument. The only way\nto be certain of the conclusion is to do the analysis without making the homogeneity assumption.\n3\n\nIn [80] a \"corrected luminosity distance\" was defined to be the same as the diameter distance. Some authors\nhave called this latter the \"luminosity distance\", which perhaps has led to a confusion of terminology and sometimes to\nincorrect definitions.\n\n11\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n3.2 The Null Cone and the Observational Relations\nLight rays arriving at the central observer O follow ds2 = 0 = d\u03b8 2 = d\u03c62 , so from (2.1) the\npast null cone (PNC) of the observation event (t = t0 , r = 0) satisfies\ndt\nR\u2032\n=\u2212\n,\ndr\nW\n\nW=\n\n\u221a\n1 + 2E ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nand we write the solution t = t\u0302(r) or r = r\u0302(t), defining the local time from the bang to O's PNC\nwith\n\u03c4 = t\u0302 \u2212 a .\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis radial null path is necessarily geodesic. We denote a quantity evaluated on the observer's past\nnull cone with a hat on top or as a subscript, for example R(t\u0302(r), r) \u2261 R\u0302 or [R]\u2227 , though this will\noften be omitted where it is obvious from the context. For a given LT model, equation (3.9) must\nbe solved numerically.\nAs is well known for the LT model (e.g. [23, 95, 87]), the redshift of sources on the PNC\nobserved at O obeys\n\u010b\u2032\nR\ndz\n=\ndr ,\n(1 + z) W\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u1e58\u2032 is given by (2.8) and (2.5).\nThe diameter distance is, by (3.2), the quantity that converts measured angular sizes of objects\nto their physical sizes at the time of emission. It is evident from the metric (2.1) that this is the\nareal radius R, evaluated on the PNC,\ndD = R\u0302 = R(t\u0302(r), r) .\n\n(3.12)\n\nand of course dL follows from (3.3).\nTo convert the proper density of an LT model to the observed redshift space density, requires\nthat we know how the locus of the PNC relates z to comoving radius, i.e. r\u0302(z). Then the total mass\ncontained in a small volume must be the same:\n\u0014 \u2032 2\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u2032\n\u0015\n2\u03c3\u0302\n\u03c1R R\nM dr\ndz\n2\ndz d\u03c9 =\ndr d\u03c9\n\u2192\n\u03ba\u03c1\u0302R\u0302 = 2\u03c3\u0302\nand \u03c3\u0302 =\n(3.13)\n\u03ba\nW\ndr\nW dz \u2227\n\u2227\nwhere (2.6) has been used.\nIn the numerical solution of these equations, (3.9), (3.11) & (3.13), we need to evaluate R, R\u2032\nand \u1e58\u2032 at each new point along the PNC.

That paper used a parabolic LT model and showed that a series expansion of dL (z)\ncould easily manifest apparent 'acceleration'. This was generalised to non-parabolic LT models in\n[113].\nIn [5] the authors constructed an LT model that has a low density region (void) at the centre,\nand asymptotically approaches homogeneity. Their functions M & f have the form (2.33) with\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nr \u2212 r0\n\u2206\u03b1\n2\n1 \u2212 tanh\n(3.26)\nM\u0303 =\nM3 = H\u22a50 \u03b10 ,\n2\u03b10\n2\u2206r\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u2206\u03b2\nr \u2212 r0\n2\nf2 = H\u22a50\n\u03b20 ,\nf \u0303 =\n1 \u2212 tanh\n(3.27)\n2\u03b20\n2\u2206r\n2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1)r 3 at the centre to H 2 \u03b1 r 3 at large r, and similarly for f .\nso that M goes from \u223c H\u22a50\n0\n\u22a50 0\nTheir 3rd function was fixed via the hyperbolic version of (2.39), choosing ti to be recombination,\nand setting Ri = a\u2217 r where a\u2217 is the RW scale factor at recombination. They then calculated\nthe redshift and the apparent magnitude for a central observer, and found they could obtain good\nagreement with observations. They also verified that they could retain the observed CMB power\nspectrum. In [4] and [3] the authors investigated an off-centre observer in two versions of the void\nmodel. They found a marginal improvement in the fit to the SNIa data is possible. If the observed\nCOBE dipole is due to this effect, it requires only a 15 Mpc displacement from centre, but the\ncorresponding quadrupole and octopole effects are then too small to match observations.\nIn [118] it was suggested that inhmogeneous models of supernova dimming have a 'weak\nsingularity' at the centre. However, this is merely a conical point in the density profile, and not a\nsingularity [79]. Also, [120] showed it is easy to smooth the central density without affecting the\nmodel much.\nRef [15] considered a selection of LT models, with and without \u039b - a central void model\nwith a = 0, a uniform present-day density and a varying Ht , a varying Hr with a = 0, both \u03c1\n\n14\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nand a varying. All the models had small density oscillations imposed to represent smaller scale\ninhomogeneity. It was argued that all of the \u039b = 0 models considered are 'peculiar'.\nIn [48] the LT functions were chosen to be 2M = Br 3 , a = 0, f = r 2 /(1 + (cr)2 ), B was set\nfrom \u03a9m0 via (2.37), and c was adjusted to get the best fit to the SNIa magnitude-redshift data.\nWith \u03a9m = 0.2 the fit was better than that of \u039bCDM.\nFor observers near the centre of an overdensity, the model of [33] agrees with dL observations\nfor part of the z range.\n[43] also compared two classes of LT models with the SNIa data, calculating \u03c72 . One model\n2 R3 ) = \u03a9 , where H, \u2206H, r and \u03a9\nwas fixed by Ht = H + \u2206He\u2212r/r0 and \u03a9m (r) = 2M/(Ht0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nare constants. The other had a = 0 and \u03a9m varying. They found that varying Ht is very effective at\nfitting the data, but varying \u03a9m is not. The best fit LT model had slightly lower \u03c72 than the \u039bCDM\nmodel, but including both inhomogeneous expansion and non-zero \u039b did not improve the fit.\nIn [22] two models were considered - a local void model with a simultaneous bang time, and\na 'hubble bubble' model in which the expansion rate Ht is higher locally than far away but the\npresent-day density is uniform. Each is a quite specific 2-parameter LT model. They confronted\ntheir models with SNIa dL data, the BAO dilation scale, dV = [d2D z/Hr ]1/3 , and the limit on Hr set\nby the age of the oldest stars. From \u03c72 calculations, they concluded that their best-fit hubble-bubble\nmodel fits the data almost as well as \u039bCDM.\nIn [45], void models with 4 or 5 parameters were considered, and it was shown that they can\nprovide a good fit observations of the SNIa dimming, the CMB, and the BAO (within 1 \u03c3) and a \u03c72\ncomparable to the \u039bCDM model. In [46], it was shown that observations of the kinematic SunaevZeldovich effect already limit LT voids to < 1.5 Gpc, and future surveys will either put tighter\nlimits on the size or constrain the density and expansion profiles. In [47], the authors proposed the\nnormalised cosmic shear as a test of inhomogeneity. They also found that LT models still provide\nexcellent agreement with updated SNIa and BAO data.\nA similar good fit with SNIa observations, i.e. a \u03c72 comparable to that of the \u039bCDM model,\nwas found in [42], which considered LT 'bubble' models with decreasing H(r) and constant\n\u03a9m (r). There was no improvement in the fit using a similar model with non-zero \u039b.\nFor a summary see [29, 30, 20]. The important issue here is to highlight the difficulty of separating the effects on the null cone observations of the cosmic equation of state, of source evolution,\nand of cosmic inhomogeneity. Whether or not \u223cGpc scale inhomogeneities are discovered, inhomogeneous models have to be taken seriously, firstly because inhomogeneities on many scales do\nexist, and secondly because we should rigorously verify homogeneity (instead of just assuming it),\nand such testing requires using an inhomogeneous model, so that the detection of inhomogeneity\nis a possible outcome.\nDifferences between Dimming Models Now the arbitrary functions of any given LT model\ndetermine not only a luminosity or diameter distance relation, dL (z) or dD (z), but also a redshiftspace density relation \u03c3(z). Each chosen model \"predicts\" a \u03c3(z) profile, and this will be important\nin distinguishing models. Though number counts are not very complete or reliable today, the\nsituation is likely to improve rapidly with future redshift surveys. In fact, the different types of\nmodel predict very different \u03c3(z).\n15\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nIf the LT arbitrary functions are written in the form of a central behaviour plus a variation,\nM = M3 r 3 (1 + \u2206M\u0303) ,\n\nf = f2 r 2 (1 + \u2206f \u0303) ,\n\na = a0 + \u2206\u00e3 ,\n\n(3.28)\n\nthen the leading terms may be related to the central cosmological parameters via\n\u00013/2\nf2 = sign(H02 (1 \u2212 2q0 )) , M3 = q0 H02 f2 /(H02 (1 \u2212 2q0 ))\n;\n(3.29)\n!\np\nf2 H0 f2 (1 \u2212 2q0 )\n3/2\n, \u03c40 = M3 (sinh \u03b70 \u2212 \u03b70 )/f2 ; (3.30)\nf2 > 0 : \u03b70 = arccosh 1 +\nq0\n!\np\nf2 H0 f2 (1 \u2212 2q0 )\nf2 < 0 : \u03b70 = arccos 1 +\n, \u03c40 = M3 (\u03b70 \u2212 sin \u03b70 )/(\u2212f2 )3/2 ;\nq0\n(3.31)\na0 = t0 \u2212 \u03c40\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhich defines a 'central RW model'. A model with a pure bang time inhomogeneity, may be\ndescribed by the functions\nM = M3 r 3 ,\nH0 = 0.72 ,\n\nf = f2 r 2 ,\nq0 = 0.22 ,\n\na = a0 + I(e\u2212r/J \u2212 1) + K(e\u2212r/J2 \u2212 1) ,\n\nI = 0.8/H0 ,\n\nJ = 0.5 ,\n\n(3.33)\n\nK = \u22120.7/H0 ,\n\nJ2 = 0.7 ,\n\n(3.34)\n\nand using this, we get good agreement with dL (z) from supernova data5 .

At present there are many uncertainties connected with\nestimating \u03c3; the number count data is not sufficiently complete or accurate, the relation to total\nmatter density is not well established, and the evolution of galaxy numbers and masses is an active\narea of research. Still, one may hope this will improve dramatically with the next generation of\nredshift surveys. Other ways of testing models, should be pursued.\nNow, observers are very likely to live on planets, which are highly likely to circle stars in\ngalaxies, which have a good chance of being inside clusters within superclusters. In other words,\nmany observers are likely to be inside regions of higher density. If the far universe is homogeneous\n(on average), then a model of an observer inside a density peak must have an intervening region of\nlower density to compensate the central overdensity. The varying bang time models that reproduce\nthe supernova dimming, also seem to generate a central overdensity quite well. Of course, variations in both the bang time and the mass-geometry-energy functions will surely be needed to get\nthe best fit to all the data.\n3.3 Determining the Metric of the Cosmos\nThe Metric of the Cosmos project aims to determine the geometry of our universe from observational data. This is an 'inverse problem': given observations such as those described above,\ndetermine as much as possible about the spacetime metric. In practice, one needs to make assumptions about the cosmic equation of state, etc, but the goal is to reduce them to a minimum.\nAn important aim of this project is to determine the degree of homogeneity in the universe.\nThe large amounts of cosmological data now flowing in will soon make this a real possibility. In\norder to do this, it is essential to remove the assumption of homogeneity, but since the use of a\nRW model is widespread in cosmological data analysis, many calculations will have to be carefully\nre-worked. Now angular homogeneity - that is isotropy - is easy to check, and does not require\nus to know anything about the PNC. Whatever the variation of observables with z is, it must be the\nsame in all directions. But radial homogeneity is not at all easy to verify, since the z-dependence\nof observables depends on several things: the time evolution of the expansion (i.e. the equation of\nstate), the source evolution, and whatever radial inhomogeneity is present. So although a general\ntreatment requires us to go beyond spherical symmetry, just pinning down the degree of radial\nvariation would be a big step forward.\nIt was shown in [95] that any reasonable 'observational' functions dD (z) or dL (z) and \u03c3\u0302(z)\ncan be reproduced by an LT model, and an algorithm for extracting the LT arbitrary functions\nwas given. This algorithm was implemented as a numerical procedure and clarified and extended\nsignificantly in [87, 58, 90].\n17\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nFor this project, we now need to invert the equations of the last section; we treat R\u0302(z) and\n\u03c3\u0302(z) as given, and we want to determine f (r), M (r) and a(r).

As stated, the obvious gauge choice is \u03b2 = 1, \u03b2z = 0. Equations (3.46), (3.49) and\n(3.47) with (3.48) constitute the differential equations to be solved for \u03c6(z), r(z), M (z) and W (z).\nThen \u03c4 (z) and a(z) follow from (2.9)-(2.11), (3.10) and (3.38). Knowing r(z), M (z), W (z), and\na(z) fully determines the LT metric that reproduces the given R\u0302(z) and \u03c3\u0302(z) data. We note that\n(3.49) is an independent DE, while (3.47) and (3.46) require \u03c6(z). Also (3.47) with (3.48) is a first\norder linear inhomogeneous ODE, for which the formal solution in known. However it is easiest to\nsolve all the DEs in parallel as one numerical procedure.\nThe initial conditions for these DEs are set at the origin at the time of observation t0 . The LT\norigin conditions applicable to these null cone equations were given in [87, 90], and are reproduced\nand generalised in the appendix.\n3.4 Apparent Horizon\nIn an expanding decelerating model, there is a point on each PNC where the areal radius (i.e.\ndD ) is maximum, dR\u0302/dz = 0.7 We denote this point by R\u0302 = Rm , z = zm , and the locus of all such\npoints is the apparent horizon (AH) - see [78, 51].\nBut points where dR\u0302/dz = 0 make the DEs (3.49) and (3.47) with (3.48) singular. However,\nin any given LT model W is a fixed arbitrary function, so we don't expect any divergence on the\nright of (3.48). Further, it was shown in (3.20) that\ndR\u0302\n=0\ndz\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u1e03 = 0 ,\nW \u2212R\n\n(3.50)\n\nwhich open up the possibility that (3.48) is not actually singular on the AH. Similarly, we don't\nexpect dz/dr or d2 r/dz 2 to be divergent here in a general LT model with co-ordinate choice (3.37),\nand in fact (3.21) and (3.45) (with dR\u0302/dz = 0) show that\n#\n\"\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\n\u03c3\u0302\u03b2\u03c6\nd2 R\u0302\n2 d R\u0302\n.\n(3.51)\n=\n\u03c6\n=\n\u2212\ndz 2\ndr 2\nR m\nm\n\n7\n\nm\n\nThis is evident in [91, 92], but first stated explicitly in [66].\n\n19\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nIndeed, (3.50) and (3.51) are exactly what happens at R\u0302m in the FLRW case. So although there\nare no divergencies at R\u0302m , the numerics break down. In [87] this was overcome by doing a series\nsolution of the DEs (3.46)-(3.49) in \u2206z = z \u2212 zm , and joining the numerical and series results at\nsome z value zj < zm - see sections 2.6, 3.3, and appendix B of that paper, and also appendix\nD below. As pointed out in [58], this phenomenon is not merely a cosmological curiosity. At\nthis locus, and no other, there is a simple relation between the diameter distance dD = R\u0302 and the\ngravitational mass Mm that is independent of any inhomogeneity between the observer and sources\nat this distance:\n2Mm = R\u0302m \u2212\n\n3\n\u039bR\u0302m\n,\n3\n\n(3.52)\n\nor R = 2M if \u039b = 0. However, the redshift zm at which this occurs is not model independent.\nThus the maximum in R\u0302 provides a new characterisation of our Cosmos - the cosmic mass. More\npractically, (3.52) and (3.51) provide a cross-check on the numerical integration: the M and \u03c6\nvalues obtained from the numerical integration must agree with those deduced from the measured\nR\u0302m and \u03c3\u0302m using (3.52) and (3.51). This requirement enables systematic errors in the observational\ndata to be spotted and at least partially corrected, as was done using (3.52) in [90]. In fact, the AH\nrelation (3.52) generalises to the Lema\u00eetre model, which has non-zero pressure [2].\nNow (3.49) may alternatively be written as\n\"\n#\n\u03c3\u0302\nd dR\u0302 (1 + z)\n= \u2212 (1 + z)\n(3.53)\ndz dz \u03c6\u03b2\nR\u0302\n#z\n!\n\"\nZ z\n\u03c3\u0302\n1 dR\u0302 (1 + z)\ndR\u0302 (1 + z)\n=\n\u22121 = \u2212\n(1 + z) dz ,\n(3.54)\ndz \u03c6\u03b2\n\u03b2 dz \u03c6\n0 R\u0302\n0\nby (3.25), consequently giving\nr(z) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\n\u03c6 dz =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\nZ z\ndR\u0302\n\u03c3\u0302\ndz .\n(1 + z) 1 \u2212 \u03b2\n(1 + z) dz\ndz\n0 R\u0302\n\n(3.55)\n\nAlthough this appears to have no singularity at dR\u0302/dz = 0, in fact the term in square brackets in\n(3.55) goes to zero, as is evident from (3.54).\nSome other attempts at solving a version of the cosmological inverse problem [11, 69, 118]\ngot stuck at this locus. See also the discussion of the apparent horizon and the 'critical points' in\n[79].\n3.5 Numerical Implementation\nNow in reality, the observations do not provide smooth functions R\u0302(z) and \u03c3\u0302(z), they provide a\nset of discrete measurements of individual sources. In order to proceed, the data must be collected\ninto many redshift bins of width \u03b4z, and bin averages calculated. Furthermore, the derivatives,\ndR\u0302/dz and d2 R\u0302/dz 2 must also be calculated. So, for each of R\u0302(z) and \u03c3\u0302(z) it is necessary to\nfit a smooth function - a polynomial say - to a range of redshift bins, otherwise mild statistical\nvariations in R\u0302(z) would create wild fluctuations in dR\u0302/dz and especially d2 R\u0302/dz 2 . The degree of\nsmoothing is necessarily a compromise between eliminating statistical fluctuations and extracting\n20\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\ninhomogeneity. For example, in [90] a quartic polynomial was fitted to 50 bins of width \u03b4z = 0.001\non either side of the bin in question.\nA second difficulty is that there is no data at the origin itself - where initial conditions for\nthe numerical integration are set. The first bin extends from z = 0 to z = \u03b4z, so it provides average\nvalues at around z = \u03b4z/2. This is resolved by fitting a near-origin series solution of the DEs to the\nfirst few data bins (see appendix C), and starting the numerical integration further out.\nAs explained above, the maximum in R\u0302 requires a series solution (see appendix D). In addition, it has one undetermined coefficient, M1 . The numerical and maximum-series results are\njoined at some redshift zj < zm and this fixes M1 . The numerical integration is resumed at\n2zm \u2212 zj , using the series values there for \"initial\" numerical values.\nThus the numerical integration has 4 regions - the origin series, the pre-maximum numerical\nintegration, the near maximum series, and the post-maximum numerical integration - which must\nall be properly joined together.\nIn [87] the above programme was implemented as a numerical procedure, and tested using\nfake data generated from an LT model. The fake observational data was exact, and contained no\nscatter or errors other than very small numerical errors. Importantly, the numerics successfully\nreproduced the LT arbitrary functions of the various homogeneous and inhomogeneous models\nused to generate the data. This validated the numerical procedure as viable in principle.\nIn [90], the effects of statistical and systematic errors in the data were considered. The numerical program was revised to output uncertainty estimates for each f (z), M (z), and a(z). It\nwas shown how to use the data at the maximum of R\u0302(z), via (3.52), to detect and correct for systematic errors in the observational data. Several examples with fake data were given. Lastly, the\nstability of the DEs (3.46)-(3.49) was analysed, and it was shown they are generally stable, except\nfor the dM/dz DE which becomes unstable at redshifts larger than zm . This issue requires further\nattention.\nApplication of this method to redshift survey data is under consideration. However, at present,\navailable data has a lot of scatter in l(z), \u03b4(z) and n(z), and considerable uncertainty in the source\nproperties L(z), D(z) and \u03bc(z) at larger z values. It is particularly likely that studies of the source\nproperties at large z have assumed homogeneity, if not a particular FLRW model. A method of\ntesting source evolution theories, independently of possible inhomogeneity, was presented in [56],\nwhich considered multiple source types and observations at several wavelengths.\nCombining Data with an Invariant Distance For many purposes, data at the same z are\ngrouped together and averaged, and it is assumed the errors cancel out. However, as is well known\nthe peculiar velocities of sources create a scatter in z values, especially in clusters, and the observer's motion creates a dipole, so although redshift can be measured to high accuracy, it is not an\nideal monotonic measure of distance. According to Walker's and Etherington's argument [119, 44]\nthe source area distance dS = (1 + z)dD is independent of the observer's motion. Since this distance is determined by the geometry of light rays emanating from the emission event, it is also\nindependent of the source motion. Therefore, if the data were good enough it would be more\ncorrect to combine data with the same dS = dL /(1 + z).\n3.6 Checking Homogeneity\nThe LT model requires two physical functions of r to be fully specified, so only models that\n21\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nsatisfy both conditions (2.31) are homogeneous. As seen above, it is perfectly possible to reproduce one observational function, such as dL (z), with a variety of inhomogeneous models, so a\none-function test is not sufficient. Thus a two-function test is imperative for an unambiguous result; for example the redshift-space density \u03c3(z) can distinguish between models that fit the dL (z)\ndata. Clearly, then, the MoC procedure will provide an important test of homogeneity, when there\nis sufficient observational data of high precision and completeness. If the procedure outputs LT\nfunctions that are close to the RW form (2.31) (say within 1 sigma), then this is a strong indication of homogeneity. Checking for homogeneity is so important that we should use all available\ntests. Any deep z test of homogeneity will depend on using the correct source evolution functions.\nAccording to [56], source evolution theories may possibly be tested with detailed multi-colour data.\n\n3.7 Other Approaches\nAlthough the above papers are the only ones that are seriously directed at eventually using\nreal observational data, [11] did develop a numerical code based on the characteristic initial value\nproblem, and [104, 70] also discussed the problem in broad terms. There have been a number\npapers looking at restricted versions of the 'inverse problem' [69, 34, 120] that only tried to fit the\ndL (z), and typically assumed this is identically the \u039bCDM-FLRW curve. Since this only fixed one\nof the LT physical freedoms, the other was fixed by the authors' choice. As already noted, [11, 69]\ndid not solve the apparent horizon (AH) problem. In [118] it was mistakenly suggested that it could\nnot be solved using inhomogeneous models - see [79] for corrections.\nIn [69] they chose dL (z) to be that of the \u039bCDM-FLRW model with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and\nset M = M0 r 3 . They considered models with both f = fRW , in which a is not uniform, and a = 0,\nfor which f is not uniform. They were able to find a variety of models that solved their inverse\nproblem, and some of the varying bang-time models had quite reasonable redshift-space density.\nThey did however encounter difficulties at the AH.\nIn [34] they assumed dL (z) has the \u039bCDM form (i.e. that of an RW model with \u03a9m = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9k = 0), a = constant, and f = H0 r 2 e\u22122H0 r , and they succeed in extracting M (r)\nonly up to z = 0.4. Their comments below their eq (32) about the inversion method not probing\nthe geometry or being unstable, actually originate from the not handling near-parabolic models\nappropriately, and from not identifying the r coordinate freedom. They also seemed unaware of\nearlier work on shell crossings in LT models.\nIn [120] they also assumed the dL of a \u039bCDM universe, as well as a = 0, and they used\nthe Dyer-Roeder equation to fix the coordinate freedom. They did overcome the AH problem,\nthough the details are unclear. Their solution procedure involved integrating outwards from the\ncentre and inwards from the AH, so joining the two parts up involved a 'search' through multiple\nintegrations to get a matching. They tested different degrees of smoothness at the centre, but\nshowed that the results in the outer regions were unaffected. They also investigated the effect of\na Dyer-Roeder clumpiness parameter that depends on z, and showed that this could reduce the\namount of inhomogeneity needed to fit observations.\nEvolution of the Redshift Detecting how the redshift of sources evolves with time, may\nbecome an important method of distinguishing models of SNIa dimming [41, 82, 117, 120].\n22\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n3.8 General case\nThe idea of deducing the metric of the universe from observations was first analysed in the\nclassic paper [80] by Kristian & Sachs, and followed up in an important review by Ellis et al [40].\nImportant early ideas appear in [44, 114]. There has actaully been quite a lot of work on this\nproblem [105, 106, 107, 108, 88, 89, 8, 6, 7, 103, 1, 59, 9], especially for the spherically symmetric\ncase and its perturbations, though the general case is quite difficult and has not been developed\nvery much. See a summary in [57]. There is much to be done here, especially turning the general\ncase into a workable numerical procedure.\n\n4. The Szekeres Metric\nThe Szekeres (S) metric [111, 112] is a very interesting and largely neglected inhomogeneous\nmodel. Like LT, it is synchronous, comoving, and irrotational, with a dust equation of state. The\nmetric is:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032 2\nR\u2032 \u2212 RE\nE\nR2\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\ndr 2 + 2 (dp2 + dq 2 ) ,\n(4.1)\n\u01eb+f\nE\nwhere \u01eb = \u22121, 0, +1, f = f (r) is an arbitrary function of r, E = E(r, p, q), R = R(t, r) and \u2032 \u2261\n\u2202/\u2202r, and an orthonormal basis for this metric is\net t = 1 ,\n\ner r =\n\n(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\n\u221a\n,\n\u01eb+f\n\nep p =\n\nR\n= eq q .\nE\n\n(4.2)\n\nApplying the EFEs, the density and the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars are\n\u03ba\u03c1 =\n\n2(M \u2032 \u2212 3M E \u2032 /E)\n,\nR2 (R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\n\nR = 4\u039b + \u03ba\u03c1 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n8\n4\u039b\n2 4 2\n2\nK=\u03ba\n[2\u039b + \u03ba\u03c1] ,\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c1 + 3\u03c1 +\n3\n3\n3\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n\nwhere\n8\u03c0\u03c1 =\n\n6M\n.\nR3\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe function R(t, r) has exactly the same dynamics (2.5) and solution (e.g. (2.9)-(2.16) for \u039b = 0)\nas for LT. The function E is given by\n#\n\"\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nS\nq\u2212Q 2\np\u2212P 2\nE(r, p, q) =\n+\n+\u01eb\n(4.7)\n2\nS\nS\nwhere functions S = S(r), P = P (r) & Q = Q(r) are arbitrary.8 The p-q 2-surfaces and E will\nbe interpreted below; in brief the constant time 3-spaces are foliated by 2-surfaces of constant\n8\n\nThe function E is often given in the form\nE(r, p, q) = A(p2 + q 2 ) + 2B1 p + 2B2 q + C,\n\n23\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\ncoordinate r, which have 2-metrics of spheres, planes or pseudo-spheres, depending on the value\nof \u01eb.\nThe \u01eb = 0, \u22121 cases have been ignored until recently [62, 75]. Although quantities like r, M (r)\netc do not have the same meaning as in spherically symmetric models, curves of constant p & q\nwill be called 'radial', 'p-radial' or 'h-radial', and prefixes 'p-' and 'h-' will indicate quasi-planar\nand quasi-pseudospherical quantities.\nSee [74] for a review of its known properties, or [101] for an introduction. See also [60, 62]\nfor an analysis of the \u01eb = +1 and \u01eb = 0, \u22121 cases.\nFree Functions The S metric has 6 arbitrary functions f , M , a, S, P and Q, which allow\na rescaling of r plus 5 functions to control the physical inhomogeneity. For the \u01eb = 0 case, the\nmapping (S, f, M ) \u2192 (S/F, f F 2 , M F 3 ) for any F (r) does not change the metric, the density or\nthe evolution equations. Thus S(r) might as well be set to 1 with F = S.\nSpecial Cases The S model contains the LT model when \u01eb = +1 and S, P , Q are all constant.\nIt therefore contains the same special cases, and has geometric possibilites at least as interesting as\nLT. With E \u2032 = 0 it reduces to the Ellis metric [38]. It also has a Kantowski-Sachs-type limit, and\nits null limit is a generalisation of the Kinnersley rocket metric [55].\nNo Killing Vectors This metric has no Killing vectors [27], but that does not mean it is even\nclose to a general inhomogeneous dust solution. It is the r dependence of E that destroys any\nspherical, planar or pseudo-spherical symmetry. Despite the inhomogeneity of the model, and the\nlack of Killing vectors, any surface of constant time t is conformally flat [10].\nMatching to Vacuum Also, any surface of constant coordinate 'radius' r can be joined to a\nsymmetric vacuum metric with spherical, planar or pseudo-spherical symmetry [24, 25, 62]. This\nlatter means that the S metric generates a symmetric gravitational field \"outside\" each and every\nconstant r shell.\nSingularities The S model has the same singularities - bang, crunch, shell crossings, shell\nfocussings - as discussed for the LT model in \u00a72.1.

To distinguish the sheets, we choose \u03b8 to be negative on one and positive on the\nother. Each constant r \"shell\" seems to be a hyperboloid with two \"sheets\", but we shall determine\nwhether both these sheets are needed, or even allowed. In the planar case, the Riemann projection\nmay be viewed as an inversion of the plane in a circle, or as a mapping of a semi-infinite cylinder\nto a plane.

Of course, if E \u2032 = 0 everywhere, this transformation recovers the LT model.\n4.2 Properties of E\nThe function E determines how the coordinates (p, q) map onto the 2-d unit pseudosphere,\nplane or sphere at each value of r. Each 2-surface is multiplied by factor R = R(t, r) that is\ndifferent for each r, and evolves with time. Thus the r-p-q 3-surfaces are constructed out of a\nsequence of 2-dimensional spheres, pseudospheres, or planes that are not arranged symmetrically.\nObviously, for \u01eb = 0, \u22121 the area of the constant t & r 2-surfaces could be infinite, but in the \u01eb = +1\ncase it is 4\u03c0R2 .\nIn the p-q plane, E has circular symmetry about the point p = P , q = Q, which is different for\neach r. The E = 0 circle\n(p \u2212 P )2 + (q \u2212 Q)2 = \u2212\u01ebS 2 ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nhas E > 0 on the outside, but becomes a point if \u01eb = 0, and does not exist if \u01eb = +1. The divergence\nof the metric components gpp and gqq as E \u2192 0 has a geometric significance that will be discussed\nbelow. The E \u2032 = 0 locus is also a circle in the p-q plane, which can be written\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq \u2212 Q Q\u2032 2 (P \u2032 )2 + (Q\u2032 )2\np\u2212P P\u2032 2\n+\n=\n+ \u2032\n+ \u2032\n+\u01eb .\n(4.16)\nS\nS\nS\nS\n(S \u2032 )2\nFor \u01eb = 0, +1, this locus always exists, and when \u01eb = \u22121 it only exists if\n(S \u2032 )2 < (P \u2032 )2 + (Q\u2032 )2 ,\n\n(4.17)\n\nwith the radius of this circle shrinking to zero as the equality is approached. It can be shown these\ntwo circles always intersect, if they both exist.\nTo see how E \u2032 /E affects the metric and the density, we write x = E \u2032 /E. Then in the metric\n(4.1), grr is a decreasing function of x provided x > R\u2032 /R, while for the density (4.6) we have\n8\u03c0\u03c1 =\n\n6M (M \u2032 /(3M ) \u2212 x)\n,\nR3\n(R\u2032 /R \u2212 x)\n26\n\n(4.18)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nso that\n8\u03c0\n\n6M (R\u2032 /R \u2212 M \u2032 /(3M ))\n\u2202\u03c1\n=\u2212 3\n,\n\u2202x\nR\n(R\u2032 /R \u2212 x)2\n\n(4.19)\n\nand if x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\n8\u03c0\u03c1 \u2192\n\n6M\n.\nR3\n\n(4.20)\n\nTherefore at given r and t values, the density varies monotonically with x = E \u2032 /E. (The sign of\nthe numerator may possibly change as R evolves.) If x can diverge, \u03c1 approaches a finite, positive\nlimit.\n4.3 Spatial 3- & 2-Geometries\nIt is apparent from the above that \u01eb determines the shape of the constant (t, r) 2-surfaces that\nfoliate the spatial sections:\n\u01eb = +1\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb = \u22121\n\nsequence of Riemann spheres\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb=0\n\nsequence of Riemann hyperboloids\n\n\u2192\n\n(4.21)\n\nsequence of Riemann planes .\n\nThis is confirmed by the curvature of the p-q 2-spaces; the orthonormal basis components of the\nRiemann & Ricci tensors and the Kretschmann and Ricci scalars are\n2\n\nR(p)(q)(p)(q) =\n\n\u01eb\n,\nR2\n\n2\n\nR(p)(p) = 2R(q)(q) =\n\n\u01eb\n,\nR2\n\n2\n\nK=\n\n4\u01eb2\n,\nR4\n\n2\n\nR=\n\n2\u01eb\n,\nR2\n\n(4.22)\n\nwhich also show R is a scale length for the curvature. In fact, it is quite possible to have the\nthree types of foliation in one S model. The original notation [111, 112] has a continuous function\ninstead of \u01eb. These 2-surfaces have area\nZ Z\ndp dq\n2\n,\n(4.23)\nA=R\nE2\nwhich is 4\u03c0R2 when \u01eb = +1, but otherwise is infinite.\nNote that grr \u2265 0 requires \u01eb + f \u2265 0, to keep the metric Lorentzian, and so\nf >0\nf =0\n\u22121 < f < 0\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb = +1, 0, \u22121\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb = +1 .\n\n\u2192\n\n\u01eb = +1, 0\n\n(4.24)\n\nClearly, the 3-d geometry determined by f may restrict the possible foliations. For example, you\ncan't foliate a positively curved space with hyperboloids, but you can foliate a negatively curved\nspace with spheres.\nCalculating the orthonormal basis components of the Riemann and Ricci tensors and scalars\nof the r-p-q 3-spaces, we find\n3\n\nR(r)(p)(r)(p) = 3R(r)(q)(r)(q) =\n\n\u22121 (f \u2032 /2 \u2212 f E \u2032 /E)\n,\nR (R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\n27\n\n3\n\nR(p)(q)(p)(q) =\n\n\u2212f\n,\nR2\n\n(4.25)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22121 (f \u2032 /2 \u2212 f E \u2032 /E) f\nR(p)(p) = R(q)(q) =\n+\nR\n(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\nR\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2\nf\n4 2(f /2 \u2212 f E /E)\n3\n+ 2 ,\nK= 2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\nR\n(R \u2212 RE /E)\nR\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22122 2(f /2 \u2212 f E /E) f\n3\nR=\n+\n.\nR\n(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\nR\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u2032\n\n(4.26)\n(4.27)\n(4.28)\n\nThe flatness condition 3R(a)(b)(c)(d) = 0 requires just9\n\nf = 0 = f\u2032 .\n\n(4.29)\n\nThis is not possible for \u01eb = \u22121. When \u01eb = 0, (4.29) would make grr diverge unless R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E =\n0, which in turn would make \u03c1 diverge unless M \u2032 \u2212 3M E \u2032 /E = 0. It will be shown this is only\npossible as an asymptotic limit.\nFor the r-p 2-spaces we find\n\n\u221a\n\n2R\n2K\n=\nR(r)(p)(r)(p) = R(r)(r) = R(p)(p) =\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 Eq (Eq\u2032 \u2212 E \u2032 Eq /E) \u2212 (f \u2032 /2 \u2212 f E \u2032 /E)\n=\n,\nR\n(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\n\u2202E\n\u2202E\n,\nEq =\n.\nwhere\nEp =\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4.30)\n(4.31)\n\nFor these surfaces to be flat requires Eq (Eq\u2032 \u2212 E \u2032 Eq /E) \u2212 (f \u2032 /2 \u2212 f E \u2032 /E) = 0, and the only solution that can hold over an entire 2-surface is f \u2032 = 0 = E \u2032 . This is because E & E \u2032 depend on p, but\nEq & Eq\u2032 don't. Note that E \u2032 = 0 implies all of S \u2032 = 0 = P \u2032 = Q\u2032 . Obviously, these surfaces may\nbe curved, even when the r-p-q 3-space they foliate is flat.\nRW in Szekeres Coordinates Since the RW metrics can be written in the Szekeres form, it\nis useful to look at the transformations between Szekeres and standard RW coordinates - see [62]\nfor a discussion. The k = \u22121 case allows all three types of foliation, which are compared below in\na constant t, \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0 slice. Blue curves are for the \u01eb = +1 case, red for \u01eb = 0 and green for \u01eb = \u22121.\nNote that there's distortion, as a negatively curved 2-surface cannot be properly represented on a\nplane - notably orthogonal lines do not look orthogonal.\n9\n\nIf instead the coordinate dependent condition 3Rabcd = 0 is used, one gets a more complicated result [62].\n\n28\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nz\n\n4.4 Quasi Spherical Case\nDipole The function E describes a dipole distribution [112, 36, 60] round the 2-sphere at each r\nvalue, having (E \u2032 /E)max = \u2212(E \u2032 /E)min located at antipodal points, and E \u2032 = 0 on a great circle\nmid way inbetween.

Naturally, the dipole orientation varies with r. By (4.1) and (4.6) E also\n\u221a\ncreates a dipole variation in the grr dr metric interval and the density around each constant t-r\n2-sphere. The distance between constant r shells varies with (p, q); RE \u2032 /E is the correction to\nthe radial separation R\u2032 of neighbouring shells, RS \u2032 /S is the forward (\u03b8 = 0) displacement, and\nRP \u2032 /S & RQ\u2032 /S are the two sideways displacements (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 0) & (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = \u03c0/2).\nE \u2032 /E\nmax\nmin\n\ngrr\nmin\nmax\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n\u03c1\nmin\nmax\n\nThe interpretation is that the Szekeres 3-spaces are constructed from a sequence of non-concentric\n2-spheres, each having a density distribution that is exactly what's needed to generate a spherical\nfield around a new centre. Here we show a section through a set of spheres, the dipole on one\n2-sphere, and a selection of possible r-p surfaces at some moment in time, as well as the dipole on\na single spherical shell, and some possible r-\u03c6 surfaces (of constant t and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\nlocal dipole axis\ncircle centres\n\nlonger\nlonger\n\nshorter\n\nshorter\n\nRegularity The conditions for regular origins, for regular spatial extrema, and for the avoidance\nof shell crossings are similar to those for LT models - see section 2.2 - except with further\nconditions on the new arbitrary functions S, P and Q.

Adjacent r-shells will first intersect at the point where grr is minimum, and as\ntime goes by the two will intersect on a circle parallel to the E \u2032 = 0 great circle - i.e. aligned with\nthe dipole. See [60], and appendix E for the conditions to avoid them.\nFor a regular extremum we require\nf = \u22121 ,\n\nand\n\nM \u2032 = f \u2032 = a\u2032 = S \u2032 = P \u2032 = Q \u2032 = 0\n\n(4.41)\n\nand the conditions for no shell crossings have to be modified - see [60].\nApparent Horizons According to the standard definition, surface \u03a3 is trapped if, for any null\nvector field kc , kb kb = 0, we have\nka ;a |\u03a3 < 0 ,\n\n(4.42)\n\nand the apparent horizon (AH) is the boundary of the trapped region\nka ;a |AH = 0.\n\n(4.43)\n\n\u0001\nNow null vectors that are momentarily 'radial', kd = K(t, r, p, q) (R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E), jW, 0, 0 , j =\n\u00b11, are also geodesic, kb \u2207b ka = 0, if\n!!\n\u0012\n\u0013\nK(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\u2032\nRE \u2032\nj\n\u1e58E \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nK =\u2212\nK\u0307 R \u2212\n.\n(4.44)\n\u2212\n+ 2K \u1e58 \u2212\n(R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E)\nW\nE\nE\nThis together with (2.8) gives\n2K\nka ;a =\nR\n\n\u0012\n\n!\n\u0013\n\u0013 r\n\u0011 2K \u0012\n\u2032 \u0010\n\u2032\n2\np\n\u039bR\nRE\nRE\n2M\n+f +\n+j 1+f ,\nl\n\u1e58 + jW =\nR\u2032 \u2212\nR\u2032 \u2212\nE\nR\nE\nR\n3\n\n(4.45)\n\nso the expansion of these geodesics is zero when (3.52) holds and l = \u2212j; that is, for incoming\nrays in an expanding region, or outgoing rays in a collapsing region. Thus [112] found R = 2M is\nthe apparent horizon when \u039b = 0.\nThe approach in [60] was a bit different, as it was not required that kb be geodesic, and it was\nrather determined whether or not null paths were moving to shells of larger areal radius R. It was\nestablished that, at any given point, the constant r shells are traversed most rapidly by null vectors\npointing 'radially'. (Null paths that stay radial are not geodesic in general.) It was then found that\nthe locus where dR/dr = 0 along a radial null direction (geodesic or not) is not coincident with a\nconstant r shell, and is p-q dependent. This was called the 'absolute apparent horizon' in [20]. Not\nsurprisingly, on any constant r shell, the dR/dr = 0 locus is (the history of) a circle aligned with\nthe local dipole direction.\nWormholes We know light can't quite get through the Schwarzschild-Kruskal-Szekeres (SKS)\n'wormhole', and we know that dense LT 'wormholes' are even less traversibile [51]. But, if a dense\nSzekeres wormhole can be bent round round as shown above, so one side is shorter than the other,\ndoes that make it easier for light to get through on the shorter side? In [60] it was found light still\ncan't get through, and ray paths were calculated and plotted for several models. Shown here are\n31\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nsome light paths (R) and apparent horizons (A) in a Szekeres 'wormhole', showing fast (f) and\nslow (s) directions.\n4\ncrunch\n\nsR+\n\n3\n\nfR+\n\n2\nsA+\n1\nt\n\n0\n\nfA+\nT\nN\n\n\u22121\n\nfA\u2212\nsA\u2212\n\n\u22122\n\u22123\nbang\n\u22124\n\u22120.25 \u22120.2 \u22120.15 \u22120.1 \u22120.05\n\n0\nr\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nNow since Szekeres spaces can bend round, this prompts the question of whether we make\na handle topology by joining up the two sides across a boundary. The Darmois matching conditions specify how to splice metrics together. (Actually, we don't need the embedding to work, or\nthe amount of bending to be sufficient, as long as the Darmois junction conditions are satisfied.)\nHowever it was found in [60] that the matching doesn't work, without creating surface layer. This\nresult includes the case of spherical vacuum - so the idea of wormhole shortcuts - commonly\nsuggested in context of the SKS geometry - is in fact impossible within Szekeres metrics.\n4.5 Quasi-Pseudo-Spherical Case\nWhen \u01eb = \u22121, the constant r surfaces are not closed, and the physical and geometric meaning of R and M have to be re-thought. We lay out some basic properties here, and attempt an\ninterpretation later.\nh-Dipole Recall that each shell of constant t & r is a two-sheeted hyperboloid of revolution.\nUsing (4.10) & (4.11), we can write\nE=\n\n\u03bdS\n,\ncosh \u03b8 \u2212 \u03bd\n\n(4.46)\n\nS \u2032 cosh \u03b8 + sinh\u03b8(P \u2032 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 sin \u03c6)\n,\ncosh \u03b8 \u2212 \u03bd\n\u03bd = sign(E) .\n\nE\u2032 = \u2212\n\n(4.47)\n(4.48)\n\nThe E = 0 circle corresponds to \u03b8 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, and its neighbourhood represents the asymptotic regions\nof the two sheets of the hyperboloid of (4.10) and (4.11).\nThe locus E \u2032 = 0 is\nS \u2032 cosh \u03b8 + P \u2032 sinh \u03b8 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 sinh \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = 0 ,\n32\n\n(4.49)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nwhich only has a solution if (4.17) holds. It is a geodesic of the p-q 2-space, and can be pictured as\nthe intersection of a plane with a right hyperboloid.\nWriting\nE\u2032\nS \u2032 cosh \u03b8 + sinh \u03b8(P \u2032 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 sin \u03c6)\n= \u2212\u03bd\n,\nE\nS\n\n(4.50)\n\np\n\n(4.51)\n\nthe extrema of E \u2032 /E are\n\u0012\n\nE\u2032\nE\n\n\u0013\n\nextreme\n\n= \u2212\u01eb2 \u03bd\n\n(S \u2032 )2 \u2212 (P \u2032 )2 \u2212 (Q\u2032 )2\n,\nS\n\nwhere \u01eb2 = sign(S \u2032 ). These extrema only exist at finite \u03b8 if\n(S \u2032 )2 > (P \u2032 )2 + (Q\u2032 )2 ,\n\n(4.52)\n\nwhich is the opposite of (4.17); so on a given constant r shell, either E \u2032 = 0 exists, or the extrema\nof E \u2032 /E exist, but not both.\nIt follows from (4.50) that this extremum is a maximum where E \u2032 /E is negative, and a minimum where E \u2032 /E is positive. Thus, for each constant r hyperboloid, on the sheet with ES \u2032 < 0\n(i.e. \u03bd\u01eb2 = \u22121), E \u2032 /E has a positive minimum and goes to +\u221e as |\u03b8| \u2192 \u221e, while on the sheet\nwith ES \u2032 > 0, E \u2032 /E has a negative maximum and goes to \u2212\u221e. We now specify that \u03b8 < 0 on the\nE < 0 sheet. From the foregoing considerations, if (4.52) holds, then E \u2032 /E is the pseudospherical\nequivalent of a dipole, having a negative maximum on one sheet and a positive minimum on the\nother, but diverging in the asymptotic regions of each sheet near E = 0.\nWe see in the metric (4.1) that RE \u2032 /E is the correction to the separation R\u2032 , along the r curves,\nof neighbouring constant r shells, meaning that the hyperboloids are centered differently and are\n\"non concentric\", as sketched below. In particular RS \u2032 /S is the forward displacement, and RP \u2032 /S\n& RQ\u2032 /S are the two sideways displacements. The shortest h-radial distance is where E \u2032 /E is\nmaximum.\n\nhyperbola centres\n\nRegularity Can \u01eb = \u22121 regions have R(t, ro ) = 0 for some ro ? The derivation of the 'origin'\nconditions (4.40) does not depend on \u01eb, but when \u01eb = \u22121, f \u2192 0 is not allowed, since f \u2265 1, so\n'origins' are not possible.\n33\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nThe analysis of [62] shows that, to be free of shell crossings, (4.52) must hold. Even then only\none sheet of the two-sheeted hyperboloid at each r - the one with 0 \u2265 (E \u2032 /E)max \u2265 (E \u2032 /E) >\n\u2212\u221e - can be free of shell crossings. However on that sheet, the conditions are weaker than in LT\n- see appendix E. As with the LT case, these are obtained by studying the evolution of R\u2032 /R. An\nimportant conclusion is that only one sheet of the Riemann hyperboloid should be used to construct\nregular models, which means not all of the p-q plane is used.\nRegular extrema, R\u2032 (t, rm ) = 0), are indeed possible. The calculations in [62] lead to\nf =1,\n\nand\n\nM \u2032 = f \u2032 = a\u2032 = S \u2032 = P \u2032 = Q \u2032 = 0 ,\n\n(4.53)\n\nbut note that the conditions for no shell crossings are more subtle at such a locus. This is not\nan obscure possibility - the k = \u22121 RW metric in pseudo-spherical coordinates has a spatial\nminimum in R.\n4.6 Quasi-Planar Case\nNo dipole For the \u01eb = 0 case, we find\n2S\n,\n\u03b82\n2(S \u2032 + \u03b8(P \u2032 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 sin \u03c6))\nE\u2032 = \u2212\n,\n\u03b82\nS \u2032 + \u03b8(P \u2032 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 sin \u03c6)\nE\u2032\n=\u2212\n,\nE\nS\nE=\n\n(4.54)\n(4.55)\n(4.56)\n\nand though the E = 0 locus has shrunk to the point p = P , q = Q, it still corresponds to the\nasymptotic regions of the plane, \u03b8 = \u221e. The locus E \u2032 = 0,\nS \u2032 + P \u2032 \u03b8 cos \u03c6 + Q\u2032 \u03b8 sin \u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(4.57)\n\nis obviously a geodesic of the p-q 2-space, and it exists provided\nS \u2032 6= 0 and\n\n(P \u2032 6= 0 or Q\u2032 6= 0) .\n\n(4.58)\n\nThere are no extrema of E \u2032 /E, and it its value extends to both \u00b1\u221e. We interpret the above as\nshowing that adjacent r-shells are planes tilted relative to each other, with tan \u03c60 = Q\u2032 /P \u2032 being\nthe direction of maximum tilt, but if E \u2032 = 0 they are parallel.\nThe behaviour found here cannot really be termed a dipole.\nRegularity The question of whether an \u01eb = 0 model may have an 'origin', R \u2192 0, is a little\ntricky. The origin conditions (4.40) require f \u2192 0. But if the metric and the 3-curvature is to be\nregular, we expect\nio2\nn h\n\u2032\nR\u2032 1 \u2212 RE\nR\u2032 E\n(4.59)\nlim grr = lim\nr\u2192ro\nr\u2192ro\nf\nto be finite and non-zero. Since RE \u2032 /(R\u2032 E) is not divergent, this implies\np\nR\u2032 \u223c f \u223c R \u21d2 R \u223c ebr , b constant,\n34\n\n(4.60)\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nwhile the p-radial distance is\ns=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\ngrr dr \u223c r .\n\n(4.61)\n\nIn other words, R, M and f may only approach zero asymptotically, and the scale of the planar\nfoliations becomes ever smaller. This is what happens in the planar foliation of the k = \u22121 RW\nmetric.\nSince the 3-spaces of a completely quasi-planar model consist of planes tilted relative to each\nother, they inevitably intersect somwhere, unless\nS \u2032 = P \u2032 = Q\u2032 = E \u2032 = 0 ,\n\n(4.62)\n\nand the no-shell crossing conditions for f \u2265 0 LT models also hold. This reduces the model to\nplanar symmetry - an Ellis model [38].\nAs with the other foliations, regular extrema require no shell crossings and f \u2192 \u2212\u01eb, as given\nin appendix E. But, by (4.25)-(4.28) and (4.6), f \u2192 0 also requires R\u2032 \u2212 RE \u2032 /E \u2192 0 and M \u2032 \u2212\n3M E \u2032 /E \u2192 0, which is the Kantowski-Sachs type limit for this case. Alternatively, f \u2192 0 also\noccurs in the origin requirement R \u2192 0 above, which can only be approached asymptotically.\nQuasi-Planar Limit A S model may have both quasi-spherical and quasi-pseudo-spherical\nregions, and the boundary surface between them is a quasi-planar timelike 3-surface. It was verified\nin [62] that the \u01eb = 0 case and projection are suitable limits of both the \u01eb = \u00b11 cases.\n4.7 Physical Discussion of the \u01eb = \u22121, 0 Cases\nRole of R\nR\nIn the metric (4.1) and in the area integral, A = R2 1/E 2 dp dq, the factor R2 multiplies\nthe unit sphere or pseudosphere, and therefore determines the magnitude of the curvature of the\nconstant (t, r) surfaces (4.22). By (4.25)-(4.28), it is also a major factor in the curvature of the\nconstant t 3-spaces. Therefore we view it as an \"areal factor\" or a \"curvature scale\". However,\nwhen \u01eb \u2264 0, it is not at all like a spherical radius. We note that when \u01eb = \u22121, there can be no origin,\nbut R can have maxima and minima as r varies, while in the \u01eb = 0 case, R cannot have extrema,\nand it can only approach zero asymptotically.\nRole of M\nIn (2.5), M looks like a mass in the gravitational potential energy term of the\nevolution equation, while in (2.7) M determines the deceleration of R. For \u01eb = +1, where the\nsurfaces of constant r are spheres enclosing a finite amount of matter, the function M (r) does play\nthe role of the gravitational mass contained within a comoving \"radius\" r. For \u01eb \u2264 0 however, R\nis not the spherical radius that is an important part of these ideas in their original form, and M is\nnot a total gravitational mass, since the constant t & r surfaces are not closed. Consequently these\nideas need revising.\nIn fact, the impossibility of an \"origin\" or locus where M and R go to zero when \u01eb = \u22121\nmeans that M must have a global minimum, and indeed regular extrema in R and M are possible.\nTherefore the local M value is not independent of its value elsewhere, and integrals of the density\nover a region always have a boundary term, suggesting the value of M (rather than its change\nbetween two shells) is more than can be associated with any finite part of the mass distribution.\n35\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nIn \u01eb = 0 models, an asymptotic \"origin\" is possible, but not required, regular maxima are not\npossible, and regular \"minima\" are actually asymptotic origins. So, with an asymptotic origin (as\noccurs in the planar foliation of k = \u22121 RW), the boundary term could be set to zero.\nNevertheless, the central roles of R and M are confirmed by the fact that the 3 types of Szekeres model can be joined smoothly to vacuum across a constant r surface at which the values of R\nand M must match. The vacuum metric \"generated\" by the Szekeres dust distribution must have\nspherical, planar, or pseudospherical symmetry, and in each, M is the sole parameter, while R is\nan areal factor.\nWe note that, even in the Poisson equation, the gravitational potential does not need to be\nassociated with a particular body of matter, and indeed it is not uniquely defined for a given density\ndistribution.\nTherefore we find that M is a mass-like factor in the gravitational potential energy.\nRole of f As shown in \u00a74.3, and as is apparent from the metric (4.1), the function f determines\nsign of the curvature of the 3-space t = const, as well as being a factor in its magnitude. In the\ncase, \u01eb = +1, this 3-space becomes flat (represented in unusual coordinates) when f = 0. In the\nquasi-pseudospherical case, with f = 0 it becomes 'flat' if the signature is made pseudoeuclidean,\n(\u2212 + +). In the quasi-planar case, f = 0 is possible as a Kantowski-Sachs type limit.\nAs with LT, f appears in the gravitational energy equation (2.5) as twice the total energy per\nunit mass of the matter particles, and we do not need to revise this interpretation. Therefore, this\nvariable has the same role as in quasi-spherical and spherically symmetric models.\nRole of E As we have seen, for \u01eb = +1, E \u2032 /E is the factor that determines the dipole nature of\nthe constant r shells, and for \u01eb = \u22121, it is the pseudospherical equivalent of a dipole, except that the\ntwo sheets of the hyperboloid each contain half the dipole, and only one of them can be free of shell\ncrossings. The shell separation (along the r lines) decreases monotonically as E \u2032 /E increases. If\nE \u2032 = 0, it is uniform, otherwise it is minimum at some location and diverges outwards. For \u01eb = 0,\nthe effect of E \u2032 /E is merely to tilt adjacent shells relative to each other, but only the zero tilt case\n(E \u2032 = 0) is free of shell crossings.\nDensity Distribution\nFor \u01eb = +1 models, the density has a dipole variation around each\nconstant r sphere, though the strength an orientation of the dipole varies with r. For \u01eb = \u22121 models,\nwhich must have f \u2265 1, it was found that, if f \u2032 /(2f ) \u2265 M \u2032 /(3M ) and there are no shell crossings,\nthe density is at all times monotonically decreasing with E \u2032 /E, but asymptotically approaches a\nfinite value as E \u2032 /E diverges. Therefore the density distribution on each shell is that of a void,\nbut the void centres on successive shells can be at different (p, q) or (\u03b8, \u03c6) positions, in other\nwords, the void has a snake-like or wiggly cylinder shape. The minimum density is only zero if\nM \u2032 /(3M ) = \u2212(E \u2032 /E)max . Far from the void, at large \u03b8, the density is asymptotically uniform with\np & q (i.e. with \u03c6), but can vary with r. However, where f \u2032 /(2f ) < M \u2032 /(3M ) everywhere, an\ninitial void in a constant r shell can evolve into an overdensity.\nThe no shell crossings conditions imply limits on how far the location of the minimum density\ncan be displaced between shells with different r.\n4.8 Applications of the Szekeres Metric\nThe Szekeres metric was not used to model cosmological structures until very recently.\n36\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\nIn [12], models of voids next to superclusters were constructed, and it was found that the\ngrowth of the supercluster is strongly enhanced, relative to the linear perturbation approach.\nIn [14], it was found small voids surrounded by large overdensities evolve more slowly than\nisolated voids, while large voids enhance the evolution of adjacent superclusters.\nA swiss-cheese model based on Szekeres inhomogeneities was used in [16] to investigate the\neffect of non-linear inhomogeneities on the CMB. While compensated inhomogeneities have a tiny\nRees-Sciama effect, the effect of uncompensated inhomogeneities is around \u223c 10\u22123 and so could\nbe responsible for the low multipoles in the CMB.\nThe effect of volume averaging was considered in [17] and it was found the results are the\nsame as in the LT case, c.f. [52].\nA generalisation of the LT void models for SNIa dimming of \u00a73.2 was given in [71]. They\nused a quasi-spherical S model with quite restricted arbitrary functions and few parameters. This\nallowed some angular variation in dL (z). It was shown that the model fits the data almost as well\nas the \u039bCDM model, even though the potential of the S model has hardly been explored.\nShell crossings in certain specific examples of higher dimensional quasi-spherical models\nwere considered in [31]. These authors have also investigated generalised quasi-spherical models, including collapse and the occurrence of \"shell focussing\" naked singularities, often in higher\ndimensions and involving non-zero pressure or heat flux.\n\n5. Conclusion\nThe universe is of course very inhomogeneous on many scales. To fully understand how these\nstructures evolve, and properly analyse our observations will require the non-linearity of exact\ninhomogeneous metrics.\nUp to now, homogeneity has been assumed, and was key to making progess. In the age of\nprecision cosmology, we should thoroughly test this assumption and quantify how good an approximation it is on each scale. Nearly all data analysis assumes the RW metric. To be sure we avoid\ncircular arguments, there is an urgent need to re-do all calculations in a general non-homogeneous\nmetric. The methods of inhomogeneous cosmology will be an essential component of this endeavour.\nLema\u00eetre-Tolman models have produced a wide variety of interesting results, and the investigations are far from exhausted.\nThe Szekeres models have a lot of flexibility, and can be used to model quite complex structures - but they have been very little investigated.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for good research.\n\nA. Near Bang and Near Parabolic Series\nNear the bang, where R = 0, (2.5) is dominated by 2M/R, and the exact solutions (2.9)-(2.16)\nfor \u039b = 0 involve the cancellation of nearly identical terms, thus generating large numerical errors.\nTaking our cue from the f = 0, \u039b = 0 solution, (2.10), i.e. R = (9M (t \u2212 a)2 /2)1/3 , we write R as\n37\n\n\fModelling Inhomogeneity in the Universe\n\na series,\nR=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nRi s i ,\n\ni=1\n\ns = \u03c4 1/3 = (t \u2212 a)1/3 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nand put it into (2.5) in the form\n3R\u1e582 = 6M + 3f R + \u039bR3 .\n\n(A.2)\n\nSolving for each power of s in turn we find\nR = R2 s\n\n2\n\nwhere\n\n!\n3V 2 23V 3 U 1894V 4 V U 3293V 5 45V 2 U\n1+V \u2212\n+\n\u2212 \u2212\n+\n+\n+\n*** ,\n7\n63\n4\n4851\n11\n7007\n2002\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n9M 1/3\n\u039bs6\n9\n9f s2\nf s2\nR2 =\n,\nU\n=\n,\nV =\n.\n=\n2\n10 2M 2\n3\n20R22\n\n(A.3)\n(A.4)\n\nIn the case \u039b = 0, this is also the near-parabolic series for small f (and s not small). When \u039b 6= 0,\nand (2.5) is integrated numerically, small f is not problematic.\nIt is a good idea to have more terms in the series than the bare minimum, so that there is a\nrange where both the series and numerical solutions are accurate, and each calculation provides a\ncheck on the coding of the other.\n\nB. Near Origin Series for Observational Relations\nWhen calculating t\u0302, R\u0302, z and \u03c3\u0302 for an LT model with given f (r), M (r) and a(r), the origin,\nwhere all but t\u0302 and a go to zero, requires special numerical treatment.
