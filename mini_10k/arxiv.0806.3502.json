We find that the\nlocal density of states near a non-magnetic impurity in the scenario of dx2 \u2212y 2 -wave superconductivity with higher harmonics is qualitatively different from that obtained from the dx2 \u2212y 2 -wave\nsuperconductivity coexisting with antiferromagnetic spin density wave order. We propose that spinpolarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements can distinguish the two scenarios and shed\nlight on the real physical origin of a non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y 2 -wave gap.\nPACS numbers: 74.72.Jt, 74.20.Mn, 74.20.Rp, 74.25.Jb\n\nPairing symmetry in the electron-doped cuprate hightemperature superconductors has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the\nhole-doped cuprates, where the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairing symmetry has been generally accepted1,2 , the earlier point\ncontact tunneling spectra suggested an s-wave like symmetry due to the absence of zero bias conductance peak\nin the spectrum3,4 . Recently, the phase sensitive scanning (SQUID) measurements5 , nuclear magnetic resonance study6 , and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments7,8 have provided strong\nevidences that the electron-doped cuprates are also the\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductors. However, the functional\nform of the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap in electron-doped materials is a more subtle issue. A non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\ngap with a maximal value in between nodal and antinodal points on the Fermi surface (FS) has been measured\nin Raman experiments in NCCO9 and ARPES data on\nthe leading-edge gap in Pr0.89 LaCe0.11 CuO4 7 .\nUp to now, the physical origin of such non-monotonic\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap is still under debate. Two kinds of theoretical explanations have been put forward. One is to\nextend the superconducting (SC) gap out of the simplest\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave via the inclusion of higher harmonics1,2 .\nBased on the theoretical assumption, the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\npairing is caused by the attractive interaction with the\ncontinuum of overdamped antiferromagnetic (AF) spin\nfluctuations, which generates a maximal gap near the\nhot spots (the points along the FS separated by the\nAF move vector QAF ). Since the hot spots in the optimally doped NCCO and PCCO are located close to\nBrillouin zone diagonals, one can generally expect the\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap to be non-monotonic. The other one is\nthe coexisting scenario in which the AF long-range order\ncoexists with the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave order10,11 . The neutron\nscattering12 and transport experiments13 have observed\na robust AF order, which survives a broad doping region\nin the phase diagram. On the other hand, the ARPES\nmeasurements revealed the intriguing doping evolution\nof the FS in NCCO14 , where two inequivalent pockets\naround (\u03c0, 0) and (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) shown in the FS have been\nexplained to the band folding due to the AF order15 .\nAs a consequence, the resulting quasiparticle excitation\n\ncan be gapped by both orders, and the non-monotonic\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap appears naturally.\nIn this paper, we argue that the local electronic structure near impurities can provide important insight into\nthe physical origin of non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap.\nWe calculate local density of states (LDOS) around\na non-magnetic impurity starting from two scenarios:\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity with a higher harmonic\nversus dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity coexisting with AF\nspin density wave (SDW) order. We find that the behavior of density of states (DOS) in both scenarios suggests\nthe presence of a non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap. Taking the single non-magnetic impurity into account, we\nfind that in the scenario of dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity with a higher harmonic, the LDOS behaves similar to\nthat shown in hole-doped cuprates16 , i.e. a single resonance state near Fermi energy appears at impurity site.\nHowever, due to introducing AF SDW order in the latter scenario, the LDOS indicates a spin-resolved feature,\ni.e. two resonance states occur at impurity site with different energies. For the sufficiently large SDW order,\none spin component (spin-up or spin-down) turns out to\nbe dominant, and although the DOS shows a U-shaped\nbehavior, the presence of resonance states at low energies in LDOS rules out the possibility of s-wave pairing\nsymmetry3,4,17,18 . Thus, we conclude that the different\nelectronic structure near a non-magnetic impurity can\ndifferentiate between above scenarios and can be checked\nby the further scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.\nWe start from a phenomenological superconducting\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\nHamiltonian HSC =\nk\u03c3 [\u03bek ck\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + \u2206k (ck\u2191 c\u2212k\u2193 +\nc\u2212k\u2193 ck\u2191 )], where c\u2020k\u03c3 (ck\u03c3 ) is the fermion creation\n(destruction) operator for an electron in the state\nwith wave vector k and spin projection \u03c3, and\n\u03bek = \u03b5k \u2212 \u03bc with the normal state tight binding dispersion \u03b5k = \u22122t[cos(kx ) + cos(ky )] \u2212 4t1 cos(kx ) cos(ky ) \u2212\n2t2 [cos(2kx ) + cos(2ky )] \u2212 4t3 [cos(2kx ) cos(ky ) +\ncos(kx ) cos(2ky )] \u2212 4t4 cos(2kx ) cos(2ky )\nwhere\n(t, t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , \u03bc)\n=\n(120, \u221260, 34, 7, 20, \u221282) with\nthe unit of meV at 0.11 doping19 reproduce the underlying FS as inferred from recent ARPES experiment7 .\nAs argued above, the maximum SC gap is achieved\n\n\f2\n\nG0 (k, i\u03c9n ) =\n\ni\u03c9n \u03c40 + \u03bek \u03c42 + \u2206k \u03c41\n,\n(i\u03c9n )2 \u2212 Ek2\n\n(1)\n\nwith Ek = (\u03bek2 + \u22062k )1/2 the quasiparticle spectrum and\n\u03c4i being the Pauli spin operator.

A good fit of \u2206k to the experimental\ndata is achieved via\nP the inclusion of a higher harmonic,\nsuch that \u2206k =\ni=1,3 \u2206i [cos(ikx ) \u2212 cos(iky )]/2 with\n\u22061 = 5.44 meV and \u22063 = \u22122.34 meV ensures that the\nmaximum of |\u2206k | along the FS is located at the hot\nspots. Corresponding FS and a non-monotonic gap as\na function of the FS angle have been shown in Fig.4 of\nRef.20.\nBy introducing a two-component Nambu spinor operator, \u03a8k = (ck\u2191 , c\u2020\u2212k\u2193 )\u22a4 , the matrix Green's function G0\nin the superconducting state can be written by\n\n4\n\n\u2206\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\u2206\n\nU =0\n0\n\nn\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n8\n\nU =0.5\n00.01\nU =1\n0\n\n(b)\n\nU =50\n\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.005\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The dependence of LDOS on scattering\nstrength U0 (a) at impurity site and (b) on the impurity's\nnearest-neighbor site. \u2206n and \u2206m denote the antinodal gap\nand maximum gap at the hot spot respectively.\n\nk\n\nwhere Rij = Ri \u2212 Rj with Ri being lattice vector. In\nthe presence of a single-site nonmagnetic impurity of\nstrength U0 located at the origin ri = 0, the site dependent Green's function in term of the T-matrix approach16\ncan be obtained as\nG(i, j; i\u03c9n ) = G0 (i \u2212 j; i\u03c9n )\n+ G0 (i; i\u03c9n )T (i\u03c9n )G0 (j; i\u03c9n ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nT (i\u03c9n) =\n\nU0 \u03c43\n.\n1 \u2212 U0 \u03c43 G0 (0, 0; i\u03c9n )\n\n(4)\n\nFor the d-wave (with or without a higher harmonic) pairing symmetry, one can find that the local Green's function G0 (i, i; i\u03c9n ) is diagonal. As a result, the diagonal\nT-matrix reads\nT11,22 (i\u03c9n ) =\n\n\u00b1U0\n1 \u2212 U0 [G0 (0, 0; \u00b1i\u03c9n)]11\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the plus (minus) sign denotes T11 (T22 ), giving\nrise to a particle- (\u03c9res < 0) and hole-like (\u03c9res > 0)\nresonance state. These resonance states generate the\nsharp peaks in the LDOS only in the unitary limit\n(| \u03c9res | /\u22061 \u2264 1) where 1 = U0 Re[G0 (0, 0; \u00b1\u03c9res )]11 .\nFinally, the LDOS which can be measured in the STM\nexperiment is expressed as\nX\nN (r, \u03c9) =\nN\u03c3 (r, \u03c9)\n(6)\n\u03c3\n\nwith spin-resolved LDOS\n1\nN\u2191 (r, \u03c9) = \u2212 ImG11 (r, r; \u03c9 + i0\u2020 ),\n\u03c0\n1\nN\u2193 (r, \u03c9) = ImG22 (r, r; \u2212\u03c9 \u2212 i0\u2020 ).\n\u03c0\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe above equations allow a complete solution as long as\nthe order-parameter relaxation can be ignored.\nIn Fig.1 we present the dependence of LDOS on scattering strength U0 . The LDOS with U0 = 0 (thick\nsolid line) which is equivalent to DOS in the clean system, shows two van Hove singularities at corresponding antinodal gap (\u2206n ) and maximum gap at the hot\nspot (\u2206m ), indicating the presence of a non-monotonic\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap, and is qualitatively consistent with\nthe recent doping dependence of tunneling spectrum in\nPr2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u2212\u03b4 21 . In the presence of a non-magnetic\nimpurity, a single resonance state appears at the impurity site (Fig.1(a)). With increasing U0 , the position of the resonance state shifts to positive high energy; meanwhile the spectral weight gradually reduces\n(the LDOS in Fig.1(a) with U0 = 50eV (thin solid line)\nhas been amplified 500 times) and finally vanishes in the\nlimit U0 \u2212\u2192\u221d. In the LDOS on the impurity's nearestneighbor site (Fig.1(b)), there are two resonance states\nlocating at the positive and negative energy with different spectral weight due to the particle-hole asymmetry.\nThese features can be understood from the Eq. (3) and\nEq. (5), where the correction to G(i, i; i\u03c9n ) due to impurity scattering reads\nU0 [G0 (i; i\u03c9n )]211\n1 \u2212 U0 [G0 (i; i\u03c9n )]11\nU0 [G0 (i; i\u03c9n )]212\n.\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 U0 [G0 (i; \u2212i\u03c9n)]11\n\n\u03b4G11 (i; i\u03c9n ) =\n\n(9)\n\nAt the impurity site, the fact [G0 (i; i\u03c9n )]12 = 0 leads to\na single resonance state; while on the impurity's nearestneighbor site, spectral weight of both resonance states is\nnonzero, i.e. [G0 (i; i\u03c9n )]11,12 6= 0 give rise to two resonance states. Due to the same spin component at sin-\n\n\f3\n\ng0\u22121 (k, i\u03c9n ) = i\u03c9n \u2212 \u03bek \u03c43 \u03c10 \u2212 M \u03c41 \u03c10 \u2212 \u2206k \u03c43 \u03c11 .

Applying T-matrix approach16 , we can easily\nget the LDOS in the presence of a non-magnetic impurity.\nThe dependence of LDOS on scattering strength U0 for\ndifferent AF SDW order M is plotted in Fig.2. Following\nthe discussions in Ref.19, we take the independent particle dispersion \u03bek , and consider the doping dependent AF\nSDW order M . We in the following calculation choose\nthe self-consistent value M = 0.14eV at 0.11 doping19 ,\nand the decreasing M values corresponding to the doping\nincreasing .\nBefore considering the effect of the impurity we briefly\nreview the evolution of DOS with AF SDW order in the\nSC state20 . In Fig.2 the LDOS with U0 = 0 (thick solid\nline) is equivalent to DOS in the clean system. In the\nlimit M = 0eV , as seen in hole-doped cuprates16 , the\n\n10\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\n5\n\nLDOS (arb.units)\n\ngle site, the spin-resolved LDOS (N\u2191 and N\u2193 ) degenerates, resulting in a degenerate single resonance state at\nthe impurity site and two resonance states on the impurity's nearest-neighbor site in total LDOS. These features, which are qualitatively similar to the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nhole-doped cuprates16 , indicate that the inclusion of a\nhigher harmonic in the gap function basically can not\nalter the local electronic structure near a non-magnetic\nimpurity, although it generates a non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 wave gap in electron-doped cuprate superconductors.\nWe now compare the above results with those resulted from the coexisting AF SDW and SC phase.\nIt is convenient to introduce a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix formulation, take four-component Nambu spinor \u03c6k =\n(ck\u2191 , ck+Q\u2191 , c\u2020\u2212k\u2193 , c\u2020\u2212k\u2212Q\u2193 )\u22a4 with Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) being the\nnesting vector, and then write\nP the mean-field Hamiltonian as HSC+SDW = \u0012 k \u03c6+\nk \u03c43 \u03c10 + M \u03c41 \u03c10 +\nk (\u03be\u0013\n0 \u03c43\n\u2206k \u03c43 \u03c11 )\u03c6k , where \u03c43 \u03c11 =\n, M is AF SDW\n\u03c43 0\norder parameter and \u2206k = \u22061 [cos(kx ) \u2212 cos(ky )]/2 is\nmonotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave SC gap. Note that from now on\nthe wave vector k is restricted to the magnetic Brillouin\nzone (MBZ).\nThe relevant matrix Green's function is obtained as\n\n5\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n6\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n6\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n(e)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n6\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\nU0=0\n0\n0.01 U =0.5\n\u22120.01\n0\n6\nU0=1 (f)\nU =50\n0 3\n\n3\n0\n\u22120.01\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The dependence of LDOS on scattering strength U0 for different AF SDW order M .

After introducing AF SDW order, another coherent peak appears at the energy less than the maximum\ngap (thick solid line in Fig.2(b)). Thus, a non-monotonic\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave SC gap occurs in coexisting AF SDW and\nSC state. In particular, the DOS shows the U-shaped\nbehavior at sufficiently large SDW order M = 0.14eV\nwith doping x = 0.1119 (thick solid line in Fig.2(c)),\nwhich has been observed in earlier point contact tunneling spectra3,4 . These unusual evolutions of DOS with AF\nSDW order are qualitatively similar to the doping evolution of DOS11 , and have been explained as the result of\nthe coexisting AF SDW and SC state11,20 .\nWe proceed to analyze the dependence of LDOS on\nscattering strength U0 near a non-magnetic impurity.\nFor the limit AF SDW order M = 0eV , we show\nthat the LDOS at the impurity site (Fig.2(a)) and on\nthe impurity's nearest-neighbor site (Fig.2(d)) are similar to that obtained from the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave hole-doped\nsuperconductors16 . With increasing AF SDW order, the\nLDOS at the impurity site are qualitatively different. In\nFig.2(b), it is clearly shown that two resonance states at\nthe impurity site occur near the Fermi energy, which indicates that the degenerate single resonance state with\nM = 0 has separated due to the presence of AF SDW order. In principle, the spin-resolved LDOS should give rise\nto multiple resonance states on the impurity's nearestneighbor site, though they are actually not easy to be resolved in Fig.2(e) because of the resonance states crossing\neach other near Fermi energy. At sufficiently large SDW\norder M = 0.14eV , one resonance state at the impurity\nsite (Fig.2(c)) exists and shifts towards the gap edge, the\n\n\f4\n\n4\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\nU =0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\u22120.01\n4\n(b)\n\n\u2193\n\nLDOS (N and N ) (arb.units)\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nU =0\n0\n\n2\n\n\u2191\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n2\n(c)\n\n0\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n4\n(e)\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nU0=0.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nU =0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\u22120.01\n\nU =0.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n4\n(f)\n\n0\n\nU =0.5\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\u22120.01\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The spin-resolved LDOS N\u2191 (dashed\nline) and N\u2193 (solid line) at impurity site without scattering\nU0 = 0eV for AF SDW gap (a)M = 0eV , (b)M = 0.05eV ,and\n(c)M = 0.14eV ; and with U0 = 0.5eV for (d)M = 0eV ,\n(e)M = 0.05eV ,and (f)M = 0.14eV .\n\nother one is barely visible due to the vanishing spectral\nweight. For the better understanding of such important\nfeatures, the spin-resolved LDOS (N\u2191 and N\u2193 ) at impurity site without scattering U0 = 0eV and with scattering\nstrength U0 = 0.5eV are shown in Fig.3 for increasing\nM .

With M increasing, the LDOS N\u2191 is not equal to N\u2193 (Fig.3b), thus\nthe degenerate spin-resolved LDOS separates, leading to\ntwo resonance states at impurity site with different spectral weight (Fig.3e).

Jpn. 73,\n\nthe LDOS N\u2191 is dominant over N\u2193 (Fig.3c), thus one single resonance state from spin-up component exists and\nshifts towards the gap edge due to the U-shaped DOS\n(Fig.3f), and the other one from spin-down component is\nbarely visible due to the vanishing spectral weight (solid\nline in Fig.3c). Therefore due to the different spin components induced by the presence of AF SDW gap, an\nexisting impurity will be polarized by a local net spin-up\nor spin-down, which leads to the splitting of the LDOS.\nThese unique features do not appear in the scenario of\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity with a higher harmonic\nand should be detected by the spin-polarized STM measurement.\nIn summary, we analyze the LDOS around a nonmagnetic impurity in electron-doped cuprate superconductors starting from two different scenarios: dx2 \u2212y2 wave superconductivity with a higher harmonic versus\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity coexisting with AF SDW\norder. We find that in both cases the DOS indicates\nthe presence of non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap, qualitatively consistent with the recent tunneling spectrum\nmeasurement in Pr2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u2212\u03b4 21 , therefore both of\nthem have been thought to be the possible physical origins of the non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap. We also find\nthat the inclusion of a higher harmonic basically doesn't\nalter the local electronic structure near a non-magnetic\nimpurity; in contrast, with introducing AF SDW order,\nthe LDOS presents spin-resolved feature, i.e. a degenerate single resonance state at the impurity site separates\ninto two resonance states due to the different spin component induced by the presence of AF SDW order. Thus\nwe strongly suggest that the future spin-polarized STM\nmeasurements should be performed to differentiate two\nabove scenarios and shed light on the real physical origin of non-monotonic dx2 \u2212y2 -wave gap in electron-doped\ncuprate superconductors.\nWe thank Prof. I.
