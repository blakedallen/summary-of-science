Introduction\nThe correlation hole as seen in the Fourier transform of the stick spectrum of a\nclosed Hamiltonian quantum system is particularly sensitive to long range spectral\ncorrelations, typical for random matrix models. This behavior in turn is indicative\nof chaos in the classical equivalent of the system via the quantum chaos conjecture\n[1, 2]. Extensive work on the detection of such correlations using the correlation hole\nhas been done in molecular physics [3, 4, 5], nuclear physics [6], and in the analysis of\nspectra from microwave cavities [7] and optical resonators [8]. As the energy spectrum\noften is not available, Jost and Lombardi have early focused attention on the analysis\nof intensity spectra (see e.g. [9]).\nP\nThe Fourier transform \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 (t) of the intensity spectrum \u03c3\u03b1 (E) = i \u03b12i \u03b4(E \u2212 Ei )\nfor a system with eigenenergies Ei and a state with amplitudes \u03b1i yields\nX\nX\n2\n\u0109A (t) = |\u03c3\u0302\u03b1 (t)| =\n\u03b14i +\n\u03b12i \u03b12j e2\u03c0i (Ei \u2212Ej ) t .\n(1)\ni\n\ni6=j\n\n4\ni \u03b1i\n\nP\n\nis 3/(N +2) for a random state. Averaging over a\nThe inverse participation ratio\nGaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) in the large N -limit leads to N \u0109A (t) = 3 \u2212 b(t).\nHere N is the dimension of the matrices and b(t) is the two-point form factor of the\nGOE [10]. For the corresponding stick spectrum 1 \u2212 b(t) is obtained instead. For\nintensity spectra the correlation hole is thus reduced to 1/3 of its full value. This\nreduction makes the detection of the correlation hole difficult. Reference [7] discusses\ndifferent ways to overcome this basic problem, which becomes more acute if cross\nsections are considered. Indeed, in the case of cross sections, the use of auto-correlation\nfunctions was shown to be of very limited efficiency.\nThe cross correlations of independent intensity spectra, by contrast, display the\nfull correlation hole. Indeed, performing the GOE average we find, instead of an\ninverse participation ratio, the product of two vector norms, i.e.\nX\nX\n\u03b12i \u03b2i2 +\n\u03b12i \u03b2j2 e2\u03c0i (Ei \u2212Ej ) t ,\n(2)\n\u0109C (t) = \u03c3\u03021\u2217 (t) \u03c3\u03022 (t) =\ni\n\ni6=j\n\nwhere \u03b2i refers to the component of the second state. Therefore the cross correlation\nbehaves as 1 \u2212 b(t).\nThis simple fact has led to a detailed study of the possibility to observe the\ncorrelation hole in correlation functions of total and partial cross sections [11]. To\nallow a comparison with regular systems, the Poisson orthogonal ensemble (POE) was\nused. It combines random, statistically independent eigenvalues [12] with orthogonally\ninvariant eigenvectors [13]. The POE does not have the universal implications of the\nGOE, both because the assumptions about spectral statistics are less well founded,\nand because we easily may encounter situations of preferred coordinate systems.\nNevertheless, it is the best random matrix model for integrability that is available.\nIndeed cross correlations prove to be the tool of choice to detect the correlation hole.\nClearly the main interest of such an analysis results when the total absorption, i.e. the\nsum over all transmission coefficients, is fairly large, which implies that the average\ntotal width \u0393 is large compared to the mean level spacing d.\nIn the present paper we analyze the total cross sections of several normalconducting microwave resonators with two antennas, obtained from measurements of\nthe scattering matrix (S-matrix) via the optical theorem. The spectra of the studied\nsystems exhibit different types of statistics, ranging from POE to GOE behavior.\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n3\n\nThe wall absorption is significant and either comparable to or much larger than the\ntransmission of the antennas. This leads us from resonances with small overlap to\nsuch with very strong overlap. Absorption channels are not directly accessible to\nexperiments.\nOur experiments address two interesting and quite general questions: On one\nhand, we test the use of cross-correlation functions to identify the effect of correlations\nin the spectrum of a chaotic Hamiltonian in the case of overlapping resonances. The\nresults of reference [11] are compared with the data. On the other hand, we investigate\nwhether absorption has to be included in terms of many weak or few strong channels,\nor whether the two cases cannot be distinguished. For this purpose we extend the\nresults of [11] to include an infinite number of weak channels, which we shall show to\ncause an exponential decay of the correlation functions.\nIn section 2 we recall some basics of random matrix scattering theory and some\nresults of [11] that are essential to our analysis, and we discuss the effect of a large\nnumber of channels with small absorption. In the following section the experimental\nsetup and the studied billiards are explained. In sections 4 and 5 we shall see that\nthe signatures of chaos are more pronounced in the cross correlation than in the\nauto correlation. Further we show that a description of absorption in terms of many\nchannels is essential to obtain agreement with the experiment even in cases where the\ntotal absorption is of order one.\n2. Basics of scattering theory and theoretical developments for\nabsorption channels\nThere is an exact correspondence between the stationary classical wave equation of an\nideal quasi-two-dimensional microwave cavity and the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor a two-dimensional quantum billiard of the same shape. This correspondence\nincludes the scattering situation, by taking the antennas explicitly into account [14],\nand ultimately even absorption phenomena.\nThe S-matrix for this situation is frequently used to describe resonant scattering\narising e.g. in nuclear, atomic or mesoscopic systems [15]:\n1\ni\nV , Heff = Hint \u2212 V V T .\n(3)\nE \u2212 Heff\n2\nHere, Hint is the Hamiltonian describing the closed billiard, and V is a N \u00d7 M matrix,\nwhich couples the N interior wave functions to M decay channels. For each antenna\nwe need one channel or column vector, where the components Vja are proportional to\nthe amplitude of the billiard eigenfunction at the position of the antenna,\nS(E) = 1 \u2212 iV T\n\nVja \u221d \u03a8j (~ra ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nprovided that the diameter of the antennas is small compared to the wavelength.\nThis approximation may only be used in regions far from any thresholds, and the\nproportionality \"constant\" typically varies slowly with frequency [16]. If symmetryequivalent positions of the antennas are avoided, then typically the column vectors of\nV are approximately orthogonal to each other. Though not essential, this assumption\nsimplifies the theoretical analysis.\nIt is convenient to work in the eigenbasis of the closed system Hint . Then the\nscattering matrix depends on the eigenvalues of Hint and on the coupling amplitudes,\ndefined in equation (4). The analysis of the experiment is carried out in the framework\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n4\n\nof random matrix theory, where chaos is represented by a GOE and integrability by\na POE. The two ensembles differ only in the distributions of the eigenvalues, while\northogonal invariance implies in both cases that the columns of the matrix V are\ndistributed according to the invariant measure of the orthogonal group. In practice we\nuse independent random Gaussian variables for the matrix elements, an approximation\nwhich becomes valid for large N .\nWe first present some elementary results of scattering theory using the notation\nof [11]. From equation (3) the cross sections are derived as\n\u03c3ab (E) = |\u03b4ab \u2212 Sab (E)|2 .\n\n(5)\n\nNote that the experimental setup allows to measure Sab directly. This avoids the\ndifficulties related to the measurement of total cross sections. The optical theorem\nestablishes a linear relation between the S-matrix elements and the total cross sections:\n(a)\n\n\u03c3tot (E) = 2 (1 \u2212 Re Saa ) .\n\n(6)\n\nThe first quantity to study is the average S-matrix. The average can be a spectral\naverage (denoted by h. . .i), an ensemble average ( . . . ), or a combination of both. For\nthe average S-matrix all these averages must coincide. In [17] it has been shown that\n1 \u2212 \u03baa\n,\n(7)\nSaa (E) =\n1 + \u03baa\nif S(E) is real and diagonal in the block of observable channels. The \u03baa are real and\npositive parameters and relate to the coupling constants Vja and the transmission\ncoefficients Ta , respectively, via\n\u03c0\n4 \u03baa\n\u03baa =\n.\n(8)\nhV 2 i , Ta =\n2 d ja\n(1 + \u03baa )2\nThe analysis will be performed in terms of correlation functions in the time\ndomain,\nE D\nE D\nEo\n1 nD (a)\n(a)\n(b)\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\n\u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ](t) =\n\u03c3\u0302tot (\u2212t) \u03c3\u0302tot (t) \u2212 \u03c3\u0302tot (\u2212t)\n\u03c3\u0302tot (t)\n,\n(9)\nL\nwhere \u03c3\u0302 are Fourier transforms of the cross sections. The Fourier transforms are taken\nover a window of size L. It should be large compared to the average level distance d\nbut sufficiently small so that the average S-matrix may be assumed constant.\nNote that due to the optical theorem (6) the correlation function between total\ncross sections is equal to the correlation function between the corresponding S-matrix\nelements:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u2217\n](|t|) .\n\u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ](t) = \u0108[Saa , Sbb\n\n(10)\n\nFor the GOE the correlation function can be calculated exactly, as will be shown below.\nFor the general case we rely on the rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation (RBWA) [11].\nThe rescaling is necessary, as soon as the transmission coefficients are not\nextremely small. In the standard Breit-Wigner approximation, the average width\nof the resonances is given by:\nM\n\nh\u0393i =\n\n2d X\n\u03bac .\n\u03c0 c=1\n\n(11)\n\nYet Ericson showed that in the limit of many channels of comparable coupling strength,\nthe correlation function of S-matrix elements or cross sections is proportional to\n\n\f5\n\nCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\nexp(\u2212\u0393C t). According to this derivation [18, 19] \u0393C should be equal to h\u0393i, but\nactually\nM\nd X\n\u0393C =\nTc\n(12)\n2\u03c0 c=1\ngives the correct value\nPMfor the correlation width. The two expressions coincide only\nin the limit where\nc=1 Tc \u226a 1. Thus the standard Breit-Wigner approximation\nis not valid in the range we are interested in. Fortunately, it turns out that the\nrescaling \u03bac \u2192 Tc /4 compensates for this defect up to rather strong overlaps [11].\nThe rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation has already been applied in the regime of\nnon-overlapping resonances [20], but without mentioning the difference to the usual\nBreit-Wigner result.\nIn the case of the correlation functions (10), we first write the S-matrix\nelements (3) in terms of the standard Breit-Wigner approximation. Then we plug\nthis into equation (9) and average over the spectrum of H0 . At last we perform the\nrescaling to obtain\nE\no\nE D\nn\nD\n(a)\n(b)\n(13)\ngb e\u2212G t/2 b2 (t) ,\n\u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ](t) = Ta Tb ga gb e\u2212G t \u2212 ga e\u2212G t/2\nPM\nwith G = c=1 Tc gc . The normalized squared amplitudes Via2 /hVia2 i are replaced by\nrandom variables gc . Due to the orthogonal invariance of the ensembles considered,\nthese variables are assumed to be Porter-Thomas distributed [19]. Note that different\nsituations may occur in the case of symmetries or integrable dynamics.\nWe account for wall absorption by introducing MW additional channels. The\ntransmission summed over all of them must equal the wall absorption,\nM\nW\nX\nTW =\nTMA +c ,\n(14)\nc=1\n\nwhere MA = 2 is the number of antennas. If MW is small, the correlation functions\ndepend on all transmission coefficients individually, and no simplification is possible.\nHowever, if MW is large, we may use that asymptotically\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u0108[Sab , Scd\n](t) \u2192 e\u2212TW t \u0108[S\u0303ab , S\u0303cd\n](t) as MW \u2192 \u221e , max (Tc ) \u2192 0 ,\n(15)\nc>MA\n\nwhere S\u0303ab describes the scattering system with only MA channels, obtained by\neliminating the last MW columns in the coupling matrix V (see equation (3)). For\nthe rescaled Breit-Wigner result (13) this proposition follows from the central limit\ntheorem.\nFor later use we produce the result for the correlation function in the case of two\nantennas with equal transmission coefficients T1 = T2 = TA . If the absorption in the\nwalls is taken into account in the many channel limit via equation (15), the ensemble\naverages in equation (13) involve two random variables g1 and g2 only. Assuming that\nboth are uncorrelated Porter-Thomas variables, and using that G = TA (g1 +g2 )+TW ,\none can evaluate the ensemble integrals analytically.

For this purpose, we assume the total wall\nabsorption to be fixed, TW = 1, and distributed equally among the absorption channels\nTMA +c = TW /MW . Figure 1(a) shows the behavior of the auto-correlation function\nfor the case of two antennas with TA = T1 = T2 = 0.26 for different values of MW .\nNote the significant changes in the shapes of the curves when MW is varied. There\nare two previous microwave experiments where the channel number dependence of the\nauto-correlation function was studied. The first one by Doron et al. [22] failed to see\nany difference between exponential and algebraic decay behavior [23]. However, in the\nmore recent work by Alt et al. [24] an algebraic decay of the auto-correlation function\nwas observed.\nIn figure 1(b) we compare the exact result with the result from the rescaled\nBreit-Wigner approximation for MW = \u221e using the same values for TA and TW as\nin figure 1(a). The difference between the RBWA and the exact result is very small.\nThis permits us to use the much simpler and more flexible RBWA in the analysis of\nour experimental data. For larger values of TA the RBWA is less accurate than in\nthe example above, but it can still be used to determine TW reliably from the autocorrelation function. The accuracy of the RBWA is discussed in detail in reference [11].\n3. Experiment\nSince the experiment is described in detail elsewhere [25], we concentrate on the\naspects relevant in the present context. Reflection and transmission measurements\nhave been performed in microwave cavities of various shapes. All cavities are flat,\nwith top and bottom plate parallel to each other. The cavities are quasi-twodimensional for frequencies \u03bd < \u03bdmax = c/(2h) (h: height of the billiard). In this\nregime there is a complete equivalence between the stationary wave equation and the\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n7\n\nFigure 1.\nAuto-correlation functions for the GOE case with two accessible\nchannels (antennas) with equal transmission coefficients TA = 0.26 and total\ntransmission for the wall absorption: TW = 1, where the wall absorption is equally\ndistributed over MW channels. In (a) the VWZ result is shown as dotted lines\nfor MW = 1, 4, 16, 64, 128, and as a solid line for MW = \u221e. In (b) we compare\nthe exact VWZ result (solid line) with the rescaled Breit-Wigner result (dotted\nline) for MW = \u221e.\n\ncorresponding stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation, where the z component of the electric\nfield corresponds to the quantum mechanical wave function,\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2\u03c0 \u03bd\n,\n(23)\n\u2206 \u03a8(x, y) + E \u03a8(x, y) = 0 , E =\nc\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions. The antennas consisted of copper wires with a\ndiameter of 1 mm, projecting lp = 2 or 4 mm into the resonator. An Agilent 8720ES\nvector network analyzer was used to determine the complete S-matrix. Measurements\nwere taken in the frequency range from 1 to 16 GHz with a resolution of 0.5 MHz.\nThe unwanted contribution of the cables to the S-matrix was removed by standard\ncalibration procedures. It was not possible, however, to get rid of the contribution\nof connectors and antennas in this way. This posed a problem in particular for\nthe reliable determination of the phase, which is vital for the cross correlation\nmeasurements. Therefore, the phase shift from the antennas was determined from\na reference measurement, where the cavity was removed, and only the antennas and\nthe supporting top plate were present. We checked that the average S-matrix is in\ngood approximation real and diagonal.\nFour different cavities were used, which are presented in table 1. The rectangular\nand the Robnik billiard both have fixed geometries. Therefore, no ensemble average\ncan be taken for these systems. Instead, we performed 10 measurements with different\nantenna positions on each system. By this we obtained 10 spectra of essentially the\nsame system (it is slightly altered by the change of the antenna positions), but with\ndifferent intensities for each of the resonances.\nThe billiard with threefold symmetry has been discussed in detail in [26]. It is\ncomposed of an outer part and an insert, both with C3v symmetry. By rotating\nthe insert we get an ensemble of systems all displaying C3 symmetry. However,\nconfigurations with C3v symmetry have been avoided. We performed 30 measurements\nwith different rotation angles and fixed antenna positions. The two antenna positions\nwere in symmetry equivalent or non-equivalent positions, alternatively.\n\n\f8\n\nCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\nbilliard type\n\nshape\n\nmaterial\n\nA/cm2\n\nL/cm\n\nh/mm\n\nlp /mm\n\nrectangle\n34 \u00d7 24 cm2\n\nbrass\n\n816\n\n116.0\n\n8\n\n2\n\nRobnik billiard\n\u03bb = 0.4\n\nbrass\n\n474\n\n77.5\n\n8\n\n2\n\nbilliard with\nC3 symmetry\n\naluminum\n\n2580\n\n358.5\n\n10\n\n4\n\nfully chaotic\nbilliard\n\naluminum\n\n2580\n\n358.5\n\n10\n\n4\n\nTable 1. Details of the studied billiards, with A: area, L: circumference, h:\nheight of the billiard, and lp : the projection length of the antennas into the\nbilliards.\n\nThe fully chaotic billiard is a variant of the C3 billiard, where the insert was\nplaced out of the center avoiding any symmetry. We performed 50 measurements for\ndifferent positions of the insert. The classical dynamics for the latter two billiards is\ncompletely chaotic.\nAs described in section 2, the transmission coefficients TA of the antennas are\nobtained from the average S-matrix (see equations (7) and (8)). In figure 2 the results\nfor TA as a function of frequency are shown for the rectangular and the fully chaotic\nbilliard. One notices a strong frequency dependence of the coupling. Such a behavior\nis typical for wire antennas. For each system, the two antennas yield approximately\nthe same transmission coefficients. In view of the frequency dependence of TA and a\ncomparable one of TW to be discussed in section 4, we examined frequency intervals\nwith a width of 1 GHz to assure that the average S-matrix and the total absorption\nare approximately constant.\nThe frequency dependence of the wall absorption is mainly due to the skin\neffect [27]. The additional width acquired by the resonances is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n8\u03c0 2 2 \u03b4(\u03bd)\nhL\n1\n\u0393W (\u03b1) = 2 \u03bd\n1+\n\u03be(\u03b1) , \u03b4(\u03bd) = \u221a\n,\n(24)\nc\nh\n2A\n\u03c0\u03bc0 \u03c3\u03bd\nwhere \u03b4(\u03bd) is the so-called skin depth, and \u03bc0 and \u03c3 are the susceptibility and the\nconductance of the cavity walls, respectively. The dimensionless quantity \u03be(\u03b1) is of\norder one. It depends on the particular resonances, indexed by \u03b1.\nTo describe the wall absorption within our statistical model, we consider the\naverage \u0393\u0304W and the variance (\u2206\u0393w )2 of the absorption width. The number of\neff\nabsorption channels MW\n(with equal transmission coefficients) can be determined\neff\ntaking into account that in the statistical model \u0393W is the sum of MW\nrandom\nPorter-Thomas variables. In order to reproduce the average absorption width and its\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n9\n\nFigure 2.

As \u03be(\u03b1)\neff\nis of order one, its variance cannot be larger. Therefore, MW\n& [2A/(hL)]2 , which is\ngreater than 200 for the studied cavities. This is certainly indistinguishable from an\ninfinite number of channels.\n4. Auto-correlation function\nIn this section we examine the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function\n(a)\n(a)\n\u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ](t) as given in equation (9). Figure 3 shows logarithmic plots of the autocorrelation functions for the rectangular and the fully chaotic billiard together with\nthe rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation for GOE and POE - assuming an infinite\nnumber of weakly coupled channels for the absorption in the walls (see equation (16)).\nThe results for the rectangular billiard do not allow us to distinguish between GOE\nand POE behavior due to their large fluctuations. At most we can see a hint of the fact\nthat the auto-correlation function for rectangular billiards tends to 2.25 instead of 3 as\nt \u2192 0. For rectangular billiards the squared amplitudes (entering into equation (13))\nare not Porter-Thomas distributed, leading to an auto-correlation function that is\ncloser to the prediction for GOE than to the one for POE.\nThe ensemble averaged auto-correlation function of the fully chaotic billiards\nshows much smaller fluctuations, of course, and we observe a very good agreement\nwith the GOE prediction. The correlation hole can be seen in particular in the linear\nplot shown in the inset of figure 3(b). However, the correlation hole is reduced to 1/3\nof its full value (see section 1), and the difference to integrable systems may be even\nsmaller.\nThe experimental auto-correlation function follows the theoretical curve for an\ninfinite number of absorption channels over five orders of magnitude. Then the auto\ncorrelation deviates from the theoretical curve. This is a consequence of the finite\nfrequency interval used in the Fourier transform. The long-time behavior is dominated\nby the Welch filter applied. Comparison with figure 1 shows that more than 100 weakly\ncoupled channels have to be assumed to explain this behavior, but the simplifying\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n2 for (a) the rectangular and (b) the\nFigure 3.

The insets show the corresponding\nlinear plots for small times t. The theoretical prediction from the RBWA is\nshown for the GOE (solid line) and the POE (dashed line). The parameters were\nTA = 0.261, TW = 1.38 for the rectangle, and TA = 0.848, TW = 14.92 for the\nfully chaotic billiard.\n\nFigure 4. Transmission TW into the walls, obtained from a fit to the autocorrelation function for (a) the rectangular and (b) the fully chaotic billiard.\n\nassumption of infinitely many channels is in accordance with the experiment as well.\nFurther, we observe that the rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation is sufficient to\ndescribe the experimental results.\nAs the antenna transmission TA has been obtained independently, the wall\ntransmission TW can be determined by fitting the experimental auto-correlation\nfunction with the corresponding rescaled Breit-Wigner expression. This procedure\nworks well for a large frequency range, and all results presented in this paper have\nbeen obtained in this way. In the low frequency regime, however, a two-parameter\nfit of the auto-correlation function, treating both TW and TA as free parameters,\nyielded somewhat better results. Figure 4 shows the frequency dependence of TW , as\ndetermined from the auto-correlation function, both for the rectangular and for the\nfully chaotic billiard.\n\n\f11\n\nCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2 for the fully chaotic\nFigure 5.

The Fourier transform was taken over the frequency range of 14\nto 15 GHz. The RBWA is shown for the GOE (dotted line) and for the POE\n(dashed line) with TA = 0.848 and TW = 14.92.\n\n5. Cross-correlation function\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nWe now present cross-correlation functions \u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ](t) of the total cross sections,\nwhich are equivalent to the ones of the respective diagonal S-matrix elements, see\n(a)\n(b)\nequation (10). Figure 5 shows \u0108[\u03c3tot , \u03c3tot ]/TA2 for the fully chaotic billiard. The\ndotted and the dashed lines correspond to the expectation from the rescaled BreitWigner approximation.\nEven after averaging over 50 realizations, the fluctuations are still quite strong.\nTherefore we apply a smoothing over an interval of size ln 2/TW , leading to the smooth\nbehavior displayed in figure 5(b). All results presented below are smoothed in this\nway.\nFigure 6 shows the smoothed results for the fully chaotic billiard both in linear and\nlogarithmic plots for three different frequency regimes. In contrast to the expectation\nfor integrable systems, the cross correlation is suppressed for small times t. The\nmeasurement thus clearly exhibits the correlation hole expected for chaotic systems. In\nparticular the logarithmic plots demonstrate that the experimental results are in good\nagreement with the rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation for the GOE over several\norders of magnitude, and clearly distinguishable from the POE expectations. For\nhigher frequencies the absorption increases, resulting in a higher value for TW and\nthus a sharper decline of the cross correlation.\nAs an example for an integrable system, we present the cross-correlation function\nfor the rectangular billiard in figure 7(a) together with the rescaled Breit-Wigner\napproximation for the GOE and the POE. The difference to chaotic systems is clearly\nseen. The discrepancy of our results from the POE is not surprising, because the\nantennas disturb the system, leading to a shift of resonance positions and thus to\ncorrelations in the spectrum. The intermediate situation is shown in figure 7(b)\nfor the Robnik billiard with mirror symmetry and non-symmetric antenna positions.\nFor \u03bb = 0.4 the classical phase space of the Robnik billiard is chaotic [28], apart\nfrom possible tiny stability islands [29]. Additionally, the theoretical result for the\nsuperposition of two GOE is plotted as dash-dotted line. In this case the two-point\nform factor b2 (t) for the GOE in equation (16) has to be replaced by b2 (2t).\nIn systems with point symmetries caution is commanded with respect to the\n\n\f12\n\nCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2 for the fully chaotic\nFigure 6.

In\nthe ideal case one would expect a result which is much closer to the auto-correlation\nfunction, but small deviations from symmetry induce uncontrollable variations.\n6. Summary and Outlook\nWe have measured the diagonal S-matrix elements of two channels as a function of\nfrequency for a variety of different microwave cavities with and without symmetries,\n\n\fCorrelation functions of scattering matrix elements\n\n14\n\nand with integrable or chaotic classical dynamics. They displayed different amounts\nof resonance overlap and antenna coupling. Via the optical theorem the diagonal\nS-matrix elements contain the same information as the total cross sections.\nWe discuss the experimental results in terms of auto-correlation and crosscorrelation functions in the time domain. The wall absorption of the billiards is\nexpressed in terms of unmeasurable channels. We find that an exponential decay of\ncorrelations, corresponding to infinitely many channels, describes the experimental\nresults adequately. Comparison with the rescaled Breit-Wigner approximation for\nrandom matrix models shows good agreement with experiment, if we use the wall\nabsorption as a fit parameter. The cross correlation was expected to display\nthe difference between integrable and chaotic systems more clearly than the auto\ncorrelation. Indeed, our experiments confirm that the correlation hole is more\npronounced in the cross-correlation function.\nDue to the optical theorem, total cross sections are accessible via the measurement\nof reflection matrix elements for microwave cavities. This is in contrast to particle\nscattering experiments, where total cross sections can only be measured in exceptional\ncases and their measurement in two different entrance channels is even more difficult.\nIn these experiments only partial cross sections are available. Theory [11] suggests that\nthe correlation hole should be best observable in correlations between cross sections\nwithout any coinciding channel indices. The simplest case of this type is the crosscorrelation function of different elastic cross sections.\nAcknowledgments\nU Kuhl is thanked for numerous suggestions and helpful discussions.
