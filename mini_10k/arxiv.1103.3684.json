Besides the thermal far field, near-field phenomena associated with\nnonpropagating modes have recently attracted increasing attention [1]. Possibly important\neffects have been revealed, such as the emergence of both temporal and spatial coherence in\nthe near field of planar thermal sources due to surface waves [2\u20134]. In addition, the influence\nof these surface waves on radiative heat transfer and dispersion forces at the subwavelength\nscale has been investigated [1]. In such studies, one usually considers a simple half-space\ngeometry, or two half-spaces separated by a narrow vacuum gap.\nThe characteristic length scale for absorption of heat radiation by the material is the skin\ndepth\ndskin =\n\n1\n,\n\u221a\nk0 Im( \u03b5r )\n\n(1)\n\nevaluated at the dominant thermal frequency \u03c9th = 2.821 kB T /~. We use the notation\nk0 = \u03c9/c, where c is the velocity of light in vacuum; \u03b5r (\u03c9) = \u03b5(\u03c9)/\u03b50 is the relative permittivity, with \u03b50 denoting the permittivity of the vacuum. Thermal radiation generated\ninside the material can reach its surface only if it originates from its outermost layer with\nthickness on the order of dskin. Hence, if the linear dimensions of a given dielectric are significantly larger than the skin depth, the emitted radiation preserves no information about the\nmaterial's geometry. In that case, radiating and non-radiating components of the thermal\nelectromagnetic field equal those emitted by a dielectric half-space [5, 6].\nIn this paper we investigate a seminal example which shows that measurable effects occur\nwhen the above two length scales become comparable, so that the half-space model becomes\ninadequate. We consider an infinite, planar dielectric slab and study the dependence of\nboth its thermal far and near field on its thickness d. When d is large compared to dskin, the\npropagating radiation emitted by the slab is described by the Planck\u2013Kirchhoff radiation\nlaw [5]. However, when d is reduced below dskin, two competing trends arise: On the one\nhand, multiple reflections of radiation inside the slab lead to a Fabry\u2013Perot-like enhancement\nof the field; on the other, the radiating source volume is diminished. We work out the\nconsequences of this competition and show that, in particular, the near-field energy density\n2\n\n\fclose to the surface of a metal film can remain finite even when the thickness of that film\nbecomes arbitrarily small, as a result of the emergence of a low-frequency surface plasmon\npolariton.\nWe proceed as follows: In Section II we briefly collect the required elements of fluctuational macroscopic electrodynamics [7], and outline in Sec. III the construction of the\nclassical dyadic Green's functions for the dielectric slab; these turn out to be significantly\nmore complicated than the more often considered ones for a half-space, or for a vacuum gap\nbetween two half-spaces [8]. Although properties of propagating thermal radiation may also\nbe obtained by more direct means [9], and numerical codes for investigating thermal radiation of layered structures do exist [10], the detailed analytical discussion of these Green's\nfunctions is of its own intrinsic value. Green's functions for layered media appear in a variety\nof contexts, such as van der Waals forces in multilayer systems [11, 12], magnetic noise in\nconducting slabs [13], light scattering and control of spontaneous emission in planar cavities [14, 15], or thermal spin flips in atoms chips [16], to name but a few. Unfortunately, the\nalgebra involved in writing down such Green's functions, though not difficult in principle, is\nvexatingly cumbersome. Here we resort to the formalism outlined in Ref. [17], based on the\nsystematic use of vector wave functions [18], which combines versatility with transparency,\nand which allows us to treat both far-field and near-field effects on equal footing. With\nthe help of the Green's functions we then derive in Sec. IV general expressions for both\nthe intensity of the slab's thermal radiation field and its energy density, deferring tedious\nmathematical details to the Appendix A. Section V contains an extensive discussion of these\nresults.\nFor the sake of definiteness we concentrate on dielectric slabs effectuating a coupling\nbetween plasma-like electron motion and the photon field [19], such as metals. Within the\nDrude approach, their permittivity is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c9p2 \u03c4\ni\n,\n\u03b5(\u03c9) = \u03b50 1 +\n\u03c9 (1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9p denotes the plasma frequency, and \u03c4 the relaxation time [20]. Since the dominant\nthermal frequency amounts to \u03c9th \u2248 1.1*1014 s\u22121 for T = 300 K, and since typical relaxation\n\ntimes for metals are on the order of 10\u221214 s, one can satisfy the inequality \u03c9\u03c4 \u226a 1 in the\ninfrared, thus arriving at the Hagen\u2013Rubens approximation [21]\n\u03b5r (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 (\u03c9p \u03c4 )2 + i\n3\n\n\u03c9p2 \u03c4\n\u03c9\n\n(3)\n\n\ffor the relative permittivity. For metals with comparatively short relaxation time, such\nas Bismuth (\u03c4Bi \u2248 2.3 * 10\u221216 s at T = 273 K), this approximation is quite good indeed.\nHowever, a Drude metallic state can also be achieved with conducting polymers; for instance,\nhexafluorophosphate doped polypyrrole [PPy(PF6 )] yields a plasma frequency in the far\ninfrared at about 2 * 1013 s\u22121 , combined with an anomalously long scattering time quantified\n\nas 3 * 10\u221211 s in Ref. [22]. Hence, while we use this approximation (3) for deriving various\n\nanalytical estimates, we rely on the full Drude permittivity (2) in our numerical calculations.\nBesides Bismuth, for which \u03c9p \u03c4 \u2248 4.8 at room temperature, we will also consider more\ntypical metals, for which \u03c9p \u03c4 is two orders of magnitude larger.\nWe consider in subsection V B the radiative intensity emitted by thin metal films, and\ndemonstrate that the opposing trends hinted at above result in an optimum film thickness\nwhich maximizes that intensity. We then study in subsection V C the \"evanescent\" near-field\nenergy density, and establish a somewhat counterintuitive result: While the contribution of\nthe TE modes to that density vanishes when the film thickness goes to zero, that of the\nTM modes does not, but remains finite and becomes universal, at least within the scope of\nthe simple Drude approach. Finally, we briefly spell out some experimental ramifications in\nSec. VI.\n\nII.\n\nELEMENTS OF FLUCTUATIONAL ELECTRODYNAMICS\n\nAs is customary, we consider the macroscopic electric and magnetic fields inside the\ndielectric material, E(r, t) and H(r, t), obtained by averaging the microscopic fields over\nsome appropriate volume [23], so that their small-scale, \"atomic\" fluctuations are smoothed\nout. Since these fields are described by real numbers, one has\nZ +\u221e\nd\u03c9\nE(r, \u03c9) e\u2212i\u03c9t\nE(r, t) =\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\nZ +\u221e\nd\u03c9\n=\nE(r, \u03c9) e\u2212i\u03c9t + c.c. ,\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c.c. denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term. A corresponding identity\nholds for H(r, t). Hence, it suffices to restrict the temporal Fourier transforms E(r, \u03c9) and\nH(r, \u03c9) to positive frequencies \u03c9.\nFollowing Rytov and co-workers [7], we describe the connection between the electromagnetic field and its sources by augmenting the dynamical macroscopic Maxwell equations by\n4\n\n\ffluctuating current fields. For nonmagnetic materials, characterized by the permeability \u03bc0\nof the vacuum, only an \"electric\" current is required, the frequency components j(r, \u03c9) of\nwhich are regarded as independent stochastic variables. The resulting equations\n\u2207 \u00d7 E(r, \u03c9) = i\u03c9\u03bc0 H(r, \u03c9)\n\n(5)\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 H(r, \u03c9) = \u2212i\u03c9\u03b5(\u03c9)E(r, \u03c9) + j(r, \u03c9)\n\n(6)\n\nthen adopt the status of Langevin-type stochastic equations, with j(r, \u03c9) playing the role of\na stochastic force. As in the theory of Brownian motion, the correlation functions of these\n\"forces\" then are of central importance. As a consequence of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, they acquire the forms [24, 25]\nh j\u03b1 (r, \u03c9) j\u03b2 (r\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032) i = 0\nh j\u03b1 (r, \u03c9) j\u03b2 (r\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032) i = 4\u03c0\u03c9 E(\u03c9, \u03b2) \u03b5\u2032\u2032(\u03c9) \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )\nh j\u03b1 (r, \u03c9) j\u03b2 (r\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032) i = 0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere angular brackets indicate an ensemble average, overbars denote complex conjugation,\nGreek letters specify vector components, and\nE(\u03c9, \u03b2) =\n\n~\u03c9\n\u22121\n\n(8)\n\ne\u03b2~\u03c9\n\nis the mean thermal energy of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with frequency \u03c9,\nomitting the vacuum contribution. As usual, \u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 is the inverse temperature variable; \u03b5\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) is the imaginary part of the material's permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9) = \u03b5\u2032 (\u03c9) + i\u03b5\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9).\nSince the stochastic Maxwell equations are linear, there exists a linear relationship between the fluctuating sources and the generated fields, which we write as\nZ\nE(r, \u03c9) = i\u03c9\u03bc0 d3 r \u2032 GE (r, r\u2032, \u03c9) * j(r\u2032 , \u03c9) ,\nZ\nH(r, \u03c9) = i\u03c9\u03bc0 d3 r \u2032 GH (r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) * j(r\u2032 , \u03c9) .\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nThe dyadic kernels GE (r, r\u2032, \u03c9) and GH (r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) are referred to as the classical electric and\nmagnetic Green's function, respectively. Once these kernels are known for the given geometry, the correlation functions (7) allow one to evaluate bilinear expressions of the fields such\nas\n\n\u03bc20\nhE\u03b1 (r, t)H\u03b2 (r, t)i =\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2032\u2032\n\n3\n\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 E(\u03c9, \u03b2)\u03b5 (\u03c9)\n0\n\n5\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nt\nE\nH\nd r G *G\n3 \u2032\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n+ c.c. ,\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhich enter into the definition of basic observables, such as the Poynting vector of the thermal\nradiation emitted by the material, or its energy density. In the following section, we outline\nthe construction of such Green's functions for a dielectric layer of finite thickness.

IV.\n\nIII.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF DYADIC GREEN'S FUNCTIONS\n\nThe electric dyadic Green's function obeys the inhomogeneous vector wave equation [17]\n\u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 GE (r, r\u2032, \u03c9) \u2212 k 2 GE (r, r\u2032, \u03c9) = 1\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) ,\nwhere\nk2 =\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c92\n\u03b5r (\u03c9)\nc2\n\n(13)\n\nis the square of the wave number inside a material with relative permittivity \u03b5r (\u03c9) = \u03b5(\u03c9)/\u03b50.\nBesides, the Green's function also has to satisfy the proper boundary conditions for the\nrespective geometry. For nonmagnetic materials, as considered here, the magnetic Green's\nfunction is then easily obtained from the electric one through the relation\nGH =\n\n1\n\u2207 \u00d7 GE .\ni\u03c9\u03bc0\n\n(14)\n\nFor constructing Green's functions, one starts from solutions V to the homogeneous vector\nwave equation\n\u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 V \u2212 k2V = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nAssuming cylindrical symmetry in planes orthogonal to the z-axis, the appropriate solutions\nare provided by the vector wave functions [17]\nM\u00b1n\u03bb (h) =\nN\u00b1n\u03bb (h) =\n\n\u2202Jn (\u03bb\u03c1) ncoso\nJn (\u03bb\u03c1) n sin o\n(n\u03c6)e\u03c1 \u2212\n(n\u03c6)e\u03c6\n\u2213n\n\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\ncos\nsin\n\n!\n\neihz\n\nih \u2202Jn (\u03bb\u03c1) ncoso\nihn Jn (\u03bb\u03c1) n sin o\n(n\u03c6)e\u03c1 \u2213\n(n\u03c6)e\u03c6\nk\n\u2202\u03c1\nk\n\u03c1\nsin\ncos\n!\nncoso\n\u03bb2\n+ Jn (\u03bb\u03c1)\n(n\u03c6)ez eihz .\nk\nsin\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nHere, Jn (\u03bb\u03c1) denotes an ordinary Bessel function of order n; the upper (lower) trigonometric\nfunction goes with the respective upper (lower) sign. The integer n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . is a\n6\n\n\fdiscrete mode index, whereas the real, wave number-like index 0 \u2264 \u03bb < \u221e is continuous.\nThis wave-number index refers to propagation orthogonal to the z-axis, and determines the\nwave number h for propagation in z-direction through the relation\n\u03bb2 + h2 = k 2 ;\n\n(18)\n\nobserve that, in contrast to \u03bb, this wave number h generally is complex. It appears as the\nargument of the above vector functions, whereas the cylindrical coordinates (\u03c1, \u03c6, z) of r\nare suppressed. The functions M\u00b1n\u03bb (h) are associated with (\u03c3-polarized) TE modes, the\nfunctions N\u00b1n\u03bb (h) with (\u03c0-polarized) TM modes. Besides solving the homogeneous wave\nequation (15), these functions (16) and (17) also satisfy the useful identities\n\u2207 \u00d7 M\u00b1n\u03bb (h) = kN\u00b1n\u03bb (h)\n\u2207 \u00d7 N\u00b1n\u03bb (h) = kM\u00b1n\u03bb (h) .\n\n(19)\n\nIt should be pointed out that, besides the vector functions of the M\u2013 and N-type, there also\nexists a third type denoted L. These functions obey \u2207 \u00d7 L = 0 and are not needed in the\npresent macroscopic approach [16, 18].\n\n0110 II\n1010\n1010 1\n1010 l\nTl\n1010 R\n1010 r\n1010 R\n1010\n1010\nz = \u2212d\n10\n1010\n1010\nI\n\n1\n\nIII\n1\nRr\nRl\n\nz = z'\n2\n\n1\n0\nIV\n\u03c1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nTr\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nz=0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n3\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nz\n\nFIG. 1: Slab geometry considered in this work. The region \u2212d \u2264 z \u2264 0 is occupied by a dielectric\nwith permittivity \u03b52 . The permittivities for z < \u2212d and z > 0 are given by \u03b51 and \u03b53 , respectively.\nA source at z = z \u2032 within the slab emits radiation with unit amplitude in both directions. One also\nhas to account for waves reflected and transmitted at both interfaces, with amplitudes as indicated,\nboth for TE and TM modes.\n\n7\n\n\fWe now consider the geometry depicted in Fig. 1: The layer between the infinite planes\nz = 0 and z = \u2212d is filled by a dielectric with permittivity \u03b52 = \u03b52 (\u03c9); in this layer we have\nstochastic source currents generating the electromagnetic field. For later convenience, we do\nnot yet assume at this point that the layer is embedded in a vacuum, but rather that the\nregion z < \u2212d be occupied by another dielectric with permittivity \u03b51 , while the half-space\nz > 0 be characterized by still another permittivity \u03b53 . This will allow us to apply the\nresults obtained here to bulk materials covered by thin coatings [26, 27].\nIf there were no boundary conditions to respect at the interfaces, but the layer \u2212d \u2264 z \u2264 0\nwere extended to fill the entire three-dimensional space, the dyadic electric Green's function\nwith boundary conditions at z = \u00b1\u221e specifying \"outgoing\" waves could directly be adapted\n\nfrom the literature [17]: For z > z \u2032 , one then has\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ \u221e\n\u221e\nX\ni\n2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nG0 (r, r , \u03c9) =\nM\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 M\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + N\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) ,\nd\u03bb\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03bbh\n2\nn=0\n(20)\nwhereas the signs of the arguments \u00b1h2 of all four vector functions have to be reversed when\n\nz < z \u2032 . Here and in the following, an unprimed vector function M or N always carries the\ncoordinates of the observation point r, whereas a primed function M\u2032 or N\u2032 refers to the\nsource point r\u2032 . The symbol \u2297 indicates a dyadic (exterior) product. Finally, M\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297\n\nM\u2032\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) is a shorthand notation for M+n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032+n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + M\u2212n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032\u2212n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ).\nFor the slab geometry specified in Fig. 1, this function G0 (r, r\u2032, \u03c9) has to be modified such\n\nthat, apart from outgoing boundary conditions at z = \u00b1\u221e, also the boundary conditions\nat the two interfaces can be implemented. To this end, we divide the space into four zones:\nAssuming the source to be located within the slab, so that \u2212d < z \u2032 < 0, we refer to the\n\nregion \u2212\u221e < z < \u2212d as zone I. Then \u2212d \u2264 z < z \u2032 is zone II, while the remaining piece\n\nz \u2032 < z \u2264 0 of the slab becomes zone III, and the positive half space z > 0 is dubbed\nzone IV . Since the tangential component of the electric field is continuous at the interfaces,\none requires\nE\nez \u00d7 GE\nI/III = ez \u00d7 GII/IV ;\n\n(21)\n\ncontinuity of the magnetic field's tangential components leads to the further boundary conditions\nE\nez \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 GE\nI/III = ez \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 GII/IV .\n\n(22)\n\nThese requirements can be met with the following, piecewise ansatz: In zone I one has only\n8\n\n\fradiation transmitted through the left interface, directed towards z = \u2212\u221e. Specifying still\n\nunknown transmission amplitudes TTl E and TTl M for the TE and TM modes, respectively,\n\n\u2032\nwe therefore write the electric Green's function GE\nI (r, r , \u03c9) with r in this zone in the form\nZ \u221e X\n\u221e\ni\n2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0\nE\nGI =\n*\n(23)\nd\u03bb\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03bbh2\nn=0\n\u001a\n\u001b\nl\n\u2032\nl\n\u2032\nTT E M\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h1 ) \u2297 M\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) + TT M N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h1 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb(h2 ) .\n\nIn zone II there is leftward-directed radiation (with unit amplitude) emitted by the source,\nbut also rightward-moving radiation reflected (with amplitudes RTl E and RTl M ) from the left\ninterface, together with further, leftward-moving radiation reflected (with amplitudes RTr E\nand RTr M ) from the right interface:\nZ \u221e X\n\u221e\ni\n2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0\nE\nGII =\n*\n(24)\nd\u03bb\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03bbh2\nn=0\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\nl\nM\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + RT E M\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) + RTr E M\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nl\n\u2032\nr\n\u2032\n+ N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + RT M N\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) + RT M N\u00b1n\u03bb(\u2212h2 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) .\nIn zone III one has, mutatis mutandis, the same dynamics as in zone II, giving\nZ \u221e X\n\u221e\ni\n2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0\nE\nGIII =\nd\u03bb\n*\n(25)\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03bbh2\nn=0\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\nr\nM\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) + RT E M\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + RTl E M\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 ) \u2297 M\u2032\u00b1n\u03bb (h2 )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nr\n\u2032\nl\n\u2032\n+ N\u00b1n\u03bb(h2 ) + RT M N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + RT M N\u00b1n\u03bb(h2 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb(h2 ) ,\nwhereas zone IV provides a mirror image of zone I:\nZ \u221e X\n\u221e\n2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0\ni\nE\n*\nd\u03bb\nGIV =\n4\u03c0 0\n\u03bbh2\nn=0\n\u001a\n\u001b\nr\n\u2032\nr\n\u2032\nTT E M\u00b1n\u03bb (h3 ) \u2297 M\u00b1n\u03bb (\u2212h2 ) + TT M N\u00b1n\u03bb(h3 ) \u2297 N\u00b1n\u03bb(\u2212h2 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nOf course, the above ansatz is characterized in mathematical terms by stating that a suitable\nsolution of the homogeneous vector wave equation (15) has been added to the particular\nsolution (20) of the inhomogeneous equation (12).\nWe are now left with eight unknowns TTr,lE,T M and RTr,lM,T E , which match the number of\nboundary conditions provided by Eqs. (21) and (22), since these apply independently to both\n9\n\n\fthe TE and the TM modes. We concentrate on the radiation field in zone IV , and therefore\nevaluate the transmission coefficients TTr E and TTr M . This procedure is quite cumbersome,\nbut elementary, so we immediately proceed to the result: The contribution of the TE modes\nto the radiation emitted by the slab into zone IV is determined by\n\u0014\n2h2\nr\n\u2032\n(h1 + h2 )e\u2212ih2 d M(h3 ) \u2297 M\u2032 (\u2212h2 )\nTT E M(h3 ) \u2297 M (\u2212h2 ) =\nD\u22a5\n\u0015\nih2 d\n\u2032\n\u2212(h1 \u2212 h2 )e M(h3 ) \u2297 M (h2 ) ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhile that of the TM modes follows from\nTTr M N(h3 )\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b52\nh1 + h2 e\u2212ih2 d N(h3 ) \u2297 N\u2032 (\u2212h2 )\n\u03b51\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u03b52\nih2 d\n\u2032\n\u2212 h1 \u2212 h2 e N(h3 ) \u2297 N (h2 ) .\n\u03b51\n\n2h2 k2\n\u2297 N (\u2212h2 ) =\nDk k 3\n\u2032\n\n(28)\n\nFor ease of notation, we henceforth omit the mode indices \"\u00b1n\u03bb\" from the vector wave\nfunctions, and use the determinants\nD\u22a5 = (h1 + h2 )(h3 + h2 )e\u2212ih2 d \u2212 (h1 \u2212 h2 )(h3 \u2212 h2 )eih2 d\n\n(29)\n\nand\nDk =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b52\nh1 + h2\n\u03b51\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b52\n\u03b52\n\u03b52\n\u2212ih2 d\nh3 + h2 e\n\u2212 h1 \u2212 h2\nh3 \u2212 h2 eih2 d .\n\u03b53\n\u03b51\n\u03b53\n\n(30)\n\nInserting these results (27) and (28) into the electric Green's function (26), the radiation field\nexisting in the half-space z > 0 is completely specified, since the magnetic Green's function\nfor that zone is immediately obtained from Eq. (14), keeping in mind the relations (19).\n\nIV.\n\nTHERMAL RADIATION EMITTED BY A DIELECTRIC LAYER\n\nAs an application of the above formalism we evaluate the intensity of thermal radiation\nemitted by the slab into the half-space z > 0, as given by the z-component of the Poynting\nvector,\nhSz (\u03c1, \u03c6, z)i = \u01ebz\u03b2\u03b3 hE\u03b2 (r, t)H\u03b3 (r, t)i\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nt\n\u03bc20 \u221e\n3\n\u2032\u2032\nH\n= \u01ebz\u03b2\u03b3\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 E(\u03c9, \u03b2)\u03b5 (\u03c9) d3 r \u2032 GE\n*\nG\n+ c.c. ,\nIV\nIV\n\u03c0 0\n\u03b2\u03b3\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u01ebz\u03b2\u03b3 denotes the Levi-Civita tensor.

In contrast to the radiative intensity, this quantity is sensitive also to\nevanescent modes.

For radiation coming from a medium with permittivity \u03b51 and going into one\nwith permittivity \u03b52 , these Fresnel coefficients are given by [23]\n12\nr\u22a5\n=\n\nfor TE modes, and\nrk12\n\n=\n\nh1 \u2212 h2\nh1 + h2\n\nh1 \u03b5\u03b512 \u2212 h2\n\nh1 \u03b5\u03b521 + h2\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\nfor TM modes. Introduction of these quantities necessitates to distinguish explicitly between\npropagating and evanescent modes. In all of this Section we assume \u03b53 (\u03c9) = \u03b50 , and thus\nstudy thermal radiation emitted into the vacuum. Then propagating modes are characterized\nby \u03bb < k0 = \u03c9/c, evanescent ones by \u03bb \u2265 k0 .

This case requires substantially more care: Provided |h\u20322 d| \u226a 1 and h\u2032\u20322 d \u226a 1, the\nabove functions f and g reduce to\nf \u2192 2h\u2032\u20322 d 1 + |r 12 |2\ng \u2192 \u22124h\u20322 d Re(r 12 )\n\n\u0001\n\n(50)\n\nin linear approximation.

In the case of propagating modes, a similar hierarchy can be established\n\nonly if one specifies the film's permittivity \u03b52 (\u03c9). In the following discussion, we restrict\nourselves to simple metals described by the Drude approach, resulting in the permittivity (2),\nor in its approximation (3), provided the Hagen\u2013Rubens condition \u03c9\u03c4 \u226a 1 can be met for\nall relevant frequencies.\nGiven such a Drude metal, the equality \u03bb2 + h22 = k02 \u03b5r2 requires |h\u20322 | \u226a h\u2032\u20322 for thermal\nfrequencies. By means of the approximation (50), one then finds |g| \u226a f for sufficiently thin\nfilms, so that contributions proportional to g may be neglected.

This characteristic length (56) coincides exactly with the\nso-called Woltersdorff thickness, which quantifies that thickness of a metallic film which\nmaximizes its absorption for frequencies \u03c9 in the Hagen\u2013Rubens regime [21, 28, 29]. Indeed,\nit has been demonstrated experimentally that metal films absorb more infrared radiation\nif they are made thinner; for most metals, maximum absorptance is obtained for films less\nthan 10\u22128 m thick [30].

Vertical lines indicate the Woltersdorff thickness (56)\nand the skin depth (1), respectively. Data are normalized with respect to the intensity SBB emitted\nby a black body. Also indicated is the bulk value (horizontal line) and the prediction based on\nEq.

Although\nmacroscopic electrodynamics will presumably start to fail for thicknesses below 10\u22128 m, we\nalso plot data for even smaller d, in order to clearly bring out the asymptotic trend. This\nexample confirms the picture drawn so far: The intensity emitted by the film almost coincides with that emitted by the bulk material when d exceeds the skin depth, but increases\n16\n\n\flog(S / SBB)\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\nlog(d / m)\nFIG. 3: Radiative intensity S emitted at temperature T = 300 K by a Drude metal with \u03c9p =\n1.4 * 1016 s\u22121 and \u03c4 = 4.0 * 10\u221214 s, as corresponding to silver (full line), and another such metal\nwith \u03c9p = 2.4 * 1016 s\u22121 and \u03c4 = 0.8 * 10\u221214 s, as corresponding to aluminium (dotted). Vertical\nlines mark the corresponding skin depths.\n\nsubstantially when d is made smaller, reaching a maximum which exceeds the bulk value by\na factor of about 3.8 at a thickness predicted neatly by the Woltersdorff formula (56), and\nthen starting to decrease. However, the regime of linear decrease described by Eq. (41) is\nreached only for unrealistically small d. For metals with more typical Drude parameters at\nroom temperature, such as silver (\u03c9p = 1.4 * 1016 s\u22121 and \u03c4 = 4.0 * 10\u221214 s) or aluminium\n\n(\u03c9p = 2.4 * 1016 s\u22121 and \u03c4 = 0.8 * 10\u221214 s), the maximum is shifted to even lower d, as witnessed by Fig. 3, so that only radiative intensity increasing with decreasing film thickness\nmight be observable in such cases. It is noteworthy that the intensity generated by a thin\nfilm can exceed the bulk limit by more than a factor of 10.\n\n17\n\n\fC.\n\nNear-field energy density for thin metal films\n\nWhile the dependence of the radiative intensity on the film thickness thus conforms to\nexpectation, the dependence of the \"evanescent\" energy density, at some distance z from\nthe film surface, on that thickness is more difficult to oversee. This is related to the fact\nthat for strongly evanescent modes with \u03bb \u226b k0 both Fresnel cofficients (44) and (45) differ\nstrongly: One finds\nrk \u2248\n\n\u03b5r \u2212 1\n\u03b5r + 1\n\n(59)\n\nfor \u03bb/k0 \u226b 1, so that\nRe(rk2 ) \u2248 1 \u2212\nIm(rk2 ) \u2248\nbut\n\n4\u03c9 2\n(\u03c9p2 \u03c4 )2\n\n4\u03c9\n,\n\u03c9p2 \u03c4\n\n(60)\n\nk02 \u03b5r \u2212 1\n,\nr\u22a5 \u2248 2\n\u03bb\n4\n\n(61)\n\ngiving\n\u0012 2 \u00132\n\u03c9p \u03c4\nk04\n\u2248 \u2212\n4\n16\u03bb\n\u03c9\n2\n2\nIm(r\u22a5 ) \u2248 2\u03c9\u03c4 Re(r\u22a5 )\n2\nRe(r\u22a5\n)\n\n(62)\n\nfor \u03bb/k0 \u226b 1 in the Hagen\u2013Rubens regime.

The permittivity is given by the Drude formula (2) with parameters corresponding\nso that a = r\u22a5\n\nto Bismuth, as in Fig. 2; the frequency \u03c9 = 1014 s\u22121 is close to the dominant thermal frequency\nfor T = 300 K.

Again, we display in Fig. 5 a plot of the function (52), and\nindicate the forecast of the approximation (67) for maximum transmission. Comparison of\nFigs. 4 and 5 reveals entirely opposite trends followed by both types of modes: Whereas for\nTM modes maximum transmission occurs for comparatively small \u03bb, unless k0 d is excessively\nlow, the maximizing \u03bb grows with k0 d in the case of TE modes.\nThese opposite trends leave their imprints in the near-field energy density. The energy\ndensity huev i(z) associated with evanescent modes of either type of polarization at a dis-\n\ntance z from the film's surface is obtained by integrating the spectral density \u033aev (\u03c9; d, z)\n20\n\n\fcharacterizing a film of thickness d in vacuum,\nZ \u221e\nev\nhu i(z) =\nd\u03c9 \u033aev (\u03c9; d, z) .\n\n(69)\n\n0\n\nAccording to Eq.

Since the factor \u03bb2 e\u22122\u03bbz has a\nwell-developed maximum at \u03bbmax = 1/z, the spectral density is maximized if the factor F (\u03be)\nis adapted to that maximum. In view of Eq.

It is important to observe that this density is dominated\nby low frequencies in the limit of thin films; the maximizing thickness is well captured by the\napproximate Eq. (71). In marked contrast, the density \u033a\u22a5 (\u03c9; d, z) effectuated by TE modes\nis maximized at a thickness which becomes larger with decreasing frequency, as depicted in\nFig. 7.\nFor calculating the near-field energy density huev i(z) we scale all wavenumbers by z,\nobtaining dimensionless quantities such as \u03b7 \u2261 \u03bbz. The resulting integral over \u03b7 can then\nbe evaluated to zeroth order in the small parameter k0 z, provided the error thus committed\nfalls into a range of frequencies where it is suppressed by the Bose\u2013Einstein function E(\u03c9, \u03b2).\nThis requirement is satisfied if z \u226a \u03bbth , where\n\u03bbth =\n\n~c\nkB T\n\n(72)\n\nis the characteristic thermal wavelength at temperature T .

This expression differs from its counterpart (77) by the\nfactor z/d \u226b 1, which is noteworthy: In the near-field regime, the energy density caused by\nTM modes increases substantially when reducing the thickness of the film, despite the loss\nof source volume. The fact that this feature emerges only for the TM modes indicates that\nit is related to surface plasmon polaritons. Indeed, when the film thickness d is sufficiently\nsmall, the plasmons associated with the two surfaces couple, splitting into one resonance\nwith a frequency that converges to \u03c9p for d \u2192 0, and a second resonance with a frequency\nthat approaches zero [19, 32]. This is exemplified in Fig. 8, where we plot the local density\nof states Dk (\u03c9, d, z), defined through the relation [6]\nZ \u221e\nev\nhuk (z)i =\nd\u03c9 E(\u03c9, \u03b2)Dk(\u03c9, d, z) ,\n\n(86)\n\n0\n\nfor a distance of z = 10\u22128 m from Bismuth films of various thicknesses. The increase of the\nenergy density huev\nk i(z) with decreasing film thickness found in Eq.

Whereas the density caused by TE modes\ndecreases monotonically with decreasing d, the one associated with TM modes actually\nincreases, and approaches a finite value for d \u2192 0.

For lower d, the resonances associated with the two surfaces\nof the film couple and split.

This universal feature stems from the fact that the low-frequency\nsurface plasmon polariton resonance depicted in Fig. 8 converges to zero frequency for all\nDrude materials. Nonetheless, the width of this resonance depends on the relaxation time \u03c4 ,\nso that the scale dmax below which the universal behavior appears is proportional to 1/\u03c4 .\nAs a consequence, metals such as gold and Bismuth, which possess nearly identical plasma\nfrequencies but substantially different relaxation times, reveal the above universality for\nrather different film ticknesses. As will be discussed in Ref. [27], the rise of the evanescent\nenergy density expressed by Eqs. (85) and (93) also occurs with thin metal films coating a\npolar dielectric, but is lost when a thin metal film covers another metal.\nFigure 10 shows a doubly logarithmic plot of the dependence of the energy density hu\u22a5 (z)i\nassociated with TE modes on the distance z from the film, summing up evanescent and\npropagating contributions. Again we take Drude parameters for Bismuth at temperature\nT = 300 K, and consider films of thickness d = 10\u22127 m and 7 * 10\u22129 m, together with\nan excessively thin model example with d = 10\u221210 m. In the first two cases, one clearly\n\nrecognizes the crossover from the z \u22121 -behavior predicted for z \u226a d by the approximation (76)\nto the z \u22122 -dependence implied by Eq. (79) for larger distances, d \u226a z \u226a \u03bbth . As indicated\nby the arrow, hu\u22a5 (z)i decreases at fixed z when d is reduced.\n\nFigure 11 displays the corresponding plot for TM modes. Here the data for d = 10\u22127 m\n\nand d = 7 * 10\u22129 m exhibit the change of slope from \u22123, as deduced from Eq. (77) for z \u226a d,\n\nto \u22122, as required by Eq.

On the one hand, Maxwell's equations have to be solved with the boundary conditions imposed by the slab geometry; on the other, the dielectric permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9)\nfor the slab's material is required. We have addressed the first problem by constructing the\ndyadic Green's functions for the slab in Sec. III, and stated general expressions for both the\nintensity of the heat radiation and its energy density, valid for any prescribed permittivity\n\u03b5(\u03c9), in Sec. IV.\nThe restricion to metallic films, with dielectric response solely due to free particle-like\nelectron motion, leads to an intricate competition of length scales. Besides the geometrical\n\n30\n\n\flog(u / uBB)\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\nlog(z / m)\nFIG. 12: Total energy density hu(z)i = hu\u22a5 (z)i + huk (z)i, for the same example cases as studied\nin Figs. 10 and 11. Observe that the energy density varies non-monotonically with film thickness\nfor distances around z \u2248 10\u22127 m.\n\nthickness d of such a film, and the skin depth (1), the Woltersdorff thickness dW defined in\nEq. (56) and the characteristic thermal wavelength \u03bbth come into play. As a consequence,\nthe dependence of the thermal near-field energy density on the distance z from the film's surface is not characterized by a single exponent, but different exponents dominate in different\nregimes. In particular, we have shown that for d/z \u226a dW /\u03bbth the energy density is dominated by the universal contribution (93) brought about by TM modes. Our conclusions are\nbased on the Drude model (2) for the permittivity, regarding the plasma frequency \u03c9p and\nthe relaxation time \u03c4 as fixed. This does not hold exactly for electrical transport in ultrathin\nmetallic films, since the resistivity of such a film increases with decreasing thickness [33],\nbut we expect the main features of our discussion to persist at least qualitatively.\nWith a view towards laboratory experiments, one might be interested not in metallic films\nin vacuum, but rather in thin metal coatings on a planar surface of another material. This\ncase has been anticipated in our general formulae (47) and (48), where the Fresnel reflection\n31\n\n\fcoefficients for the left interface differ from those for the right one, but one still has to\naccount for the bulk contribution [26, 27]. Qualitatively, however, the Fabry\u2013Perot-like\neffect brought about by thin metal coatings bears interesting possibilities of manipulating\nthe intensity of thermal radiation, that is, the amount of energy transported per time from\na hot body into the vacuum.\nThe insights obtained in this work are especially pertinent with regard to recent developmemts in scanning thermal microscopy [34, 35]. It has been argued that the tip of a thermal\nmicroscope operating in ultrahigh vacuum is sensitive to the near-field energy density above\nthe sample; experiments along this direction are presently underway [36]. Near-field signatures offered by thin films, or by bulk materials coated with films of varying, exactly\nspecified thickness even down to that of atomic monolayers, and their actual observation in\na suitable experiment could be of value for developing scanning thermal microscopy into a\nquantitative tool for materials science.\nWhile we have formally extrapolated the realm of macroscopic electrodynamics down to\neven unrealistically small scales, it goes without saying that at some scale deviations from\nthe macroscopic description will show up; such deviations now have come within the scope of\nmodern experimental set-ups [36]. In addition, one has to expect important corrections due\nto effects of non-local optical response [31, 37]. The pursuit of the question at precisely what\nlength scale, and in precisely what manner, these deviations start to manifest themselves is\na quite important task in nanoscale thermal engineering. In this quest, the present study\nmay serve as a reference.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nS.-A. B. acknowledges support from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes. We thank\nU. Fleischmann-Wischnath, O.
