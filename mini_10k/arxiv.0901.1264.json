The suppression factor mD /MR makes the light neutrino mass much smaller than the usual\nDirac mass mD which is of order the charged lepton mass. This is a very nice way to\nexplain why light neutrino masses are so much lighter than their charged partners.\na Presented\n\nby Xiao-Gang He. e-mail: hexg@phys.ntu.edu.tw\n\n\fNovember 8, 2018 0:50 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\ncospa-08 \u0307final\n\nXiao-Gang He\n\nThe lightness of neutrino masses in the See-Saw mechanism is related to a large\nscale for MR . One may ask the question, how large a scale for MR needs to be to\nproduce the light neutrino mass of order not larger than an eV. Let us taking some\nexamples of mD to get a feeling about this.\nmD = me :\nmD = m\u03bc :\nmD = m\u03c4 :\n\nm\u03bd1 = m2e /MR , with m\u03bd1 = 0.1eV, MR \u2243 2.5TeV\n\nm\u03bd2 = m2\u03bc /MR , with m\u03bd2 = 0.1eV, MR \u2243 108 GeV\n\nm\u03bd3 = m2\u03c4 /MR , with m\u03bd3 = 0.1eV, MR \u2243 3 \u00d7 1010 GeV. (2)\n\nIf mD is smaller than me , MR can be in the O(100GeV) range. If mD is larger than\nm\u03c4 or m\u03bdi smaller than 0.1 eV, MR can be of the grand unification scale 1015 GeV.\nModels with MR completely fixed in terms of low energy neutrino masses, mixing\nangle and Majorana phases can be constructed such that2\nMR = m\u0302f UP\u2217 N MS m\u0302\u22121\n\u03bd UP MN S m\u0302f ,\n\nf = u, d, e.\n\nThis type of relation results in the right-handed neutrino masses as low as a few\nTeV and as high as grand unification scale.\nWith low See-Saw scale of order a TeV, it gives the hope of testing See-Saw\nmechanism at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For See-Saw scale in the range\nfrom a few TeV to grand unification scale, it is possible to explain why our universe\nis dominated by matter, the baryon asymmetry problem, through the leptogenesis\nmechanism3 . A lot of things can be said about the See-Saw mechanism! Whether\none can have low mass See-Saw scale which can be probed at LHC and at the same\ntime solve the baryon asymmetry problem depends on the detailed models.\nThere are different ways to realize See-Saw mechanism. They can be categorized\nas Type I, Type II and Type III See-Saw mechanisms. The main features of these\nmodels are:\nType I1 : Introducing singlet right handed neutrinos \u03bdR : (1, 1, 0) under the\nstandard model (SM) gauge group, SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)I \u00d7 U (1)Y . \u03bdR does not have\nSM gauge interactions. The terms relevant to neutrino masses are given by,\n1 c\nMR \u03bdR + h.c. ,\n(3)\nL = L\u0304L YD H\u0303\u03bdR + \u03bd\u0304R\n2\n\u221a\nwhere H \u2261 (\u03c6+ , \u03c60 )T \u2261 (\u03c6+ , (v+h+i\u03b7)/ 2)T is the Higgs doublet, and H\u0303 = i\u03c42 H \u2217 .\nAfter the Higgs develops VEV, one obtains the neutrino See-Saw mass matrix,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 mD\n,\n(4)\nM=\nmTD MR\nwhere mD = YD hH\u0303i = YD v.\nType II4 : Introducing a triplet Higgs representation \u2206 : (1, 3, 1) which leads to\nneutrino masses through the following terms,\n\u221a\n1\nv2\nL = \u221a L\u0304cL Yt \u2206LL , \u2192 m\u03bd = Yt vt , vt = 2h\u2206i \u2192\n, M\u2206 : mass of \u2206.\nM\u2206\n2\n\n\fNovember 8, 2018 0:50 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\ncospa-08 \u0307final\n\nLeptogenesis and LHC Physics with Type III See-Saw\n\n3\n\nType III5 : Introducing triplet lepton representations \u03a3 : (1, 3, 0) to generate\nSee-Saw neutrino mass matrix. This model was first proposed in 1989.\nIn this type of model, it is possible to have low See-Saw scale of order a TeV\nto realize leptogenesis and may have detectable effects at LHC due to the fact that\nthe heavy triplet leptons have gauge interactions. In the following we describe the\nmodel in more detail.\nThe type III See-Saw model consists, in addition to the SM particles, three\nleft-handed triplets of leptons with zero hypercharge,\n\u0013\n\u0012 0c \u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012 0 \u221a\nE +\u221a\nE \u2212c\u221a\nN / 2\nN / 2\nc\n, \u03a3 =\n.\n(5)\n\u03a3=\nE \u2212 \u2212N 0 / 2\nE +c \u2212N 0c / 2\nThe renormalizable Lagrangian involving \u03a3 is given by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\nD\u03a3] \u2212 T r[\u03a3M\u03a3 \u03a3c + \u03a3c M\u03a3\u2217 \u03a3] \u2212 H\u0303 \u2020 \u03a3 2Y\u03a3 LL \u2212 LL 2Y\u03a3 \u2020 \u03a3H\u0303 .\nL = T r[\u03a3i/\n2\n+c\n\u2212\nDefining E \u2261 ER\n+ ER\n, one obtains the Lagrangian\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\u03a3 0c\n0\n0\n0\nN + h.c.\nL = Ei\u2202\n/E + NR i\u2202\n/NR \u2212 EM\u03a3 E \u2212 NR\n2 R\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+ g W\u03bc+ NR0 \u03b3\u03bc PR E + W\u03bc+ NR0c \u03b3\u03bc PL E + h.c. \u2212 g W\u03bc3 E\u03b3\u03bc E\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212 \u03c60 NR0 Y\u03a3 \u03bdL + 2\u03c60 EY\u03a3 lL + \u03c6+ NR0 Y\u03a3 lL \u2212 2\u03c6+ \u03bdL c Y\u03a3T E + h.c. .\nOne can easily identify the terms related to neutrino masses from the above and\nobtain the mass matrix as\n\u221a \u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u221a Y\u03a3 T v/2 2\n\u03bdL\nc\n0\nL = \u2212(\u03bdL N )\n.\nN 0c\nY\u03a3 v/2 2 M\u03a3 /2\nThis is the standard See-Saw mass matrix.\nThe charged partners in the triplet \u03a3 mix with the SM charged leptons resulting\nin a mass matrix of the following form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\nml 0\nlL\nL = \u2212(lR ER )\n.\n(6)\nEL\nY\u03a3 v M\u03a3\nDiagonalizing the above mass matrices, one can work out the interactions of\nW, Z, \u03b3 and Higgs with heavy and light neutrinos, and also the heavy and light\ncharged leptons.

The gauge interaction of the heavy particles\nalso participate in leptogenesis modifying some properties, comparing with Type I\nSee-Saw. We now discuss some of the main results related to leptogenesis and LHC\nphysics.\n\n\fNovember 8, 2018 0:50 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\ncospa-08 \u0307final\n\nXiao-Gang He\n\n2. Leptogenesis with Type III See-Saw\nIt is a well known fact that our universe is dominated by matter. If the universe\nstarted with a symmetric one with equal matter and anti-matter, why our universe is dominated by matter is the famous baryon asymmetry problem. Putting\nthings into cosmological perspective, if the universe started with a symmetric one,\nat present one would expect that the ratio nB /n\u03b3 of baryon and photon number densities should be \u223c 10\u221220 , and also nB \u2212 nB\u0304 = 0. But observations from\nBig-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) imply\n(nB \u2212 nB\u0304 )/n\u03b3 = nB /n\u03b3 = (6.15 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 10\u221210 . Baryon number density is much\nlarger than expectation, ten orders of magnitude larger than expectation!\nThe leptogenesis3 mechanism is the mechanism that transferring lepton number\nviolation into baryon number violation. The key of the mechanism is that at high\nenough temperature the baryon number B and lepton number L violating anomalous\nweak gauge boson interaction with fermions, the sphaleron effect, although not\nenough to generated the observed baryon asymmetry, it can change net lepton\nnumber into baryon number and then result in baryon asymmetry. The sphaleraon\neffect violates B and L, but conserves B \u2212 L. When sphaleron effect is in effective,\nB + L is washed out, but B \u2212 L is preserved. If the washout for B + L is complete,\nfor initially non-zero Li , but zero Bi , after the sphaleron effect taken place, the final\nbaryon and lepton numbers Bf and Lf will be given by\nBi \u2212 L i = Bf \u2212 L f ,\n\n1\n1\nBf + L f = 0 , \u2192 Bf = \u2212 L i , L f = L i .\n2\n2\n\nIn general the washout is not complete, in the SM with one Higgs doublet: Bf =\n28\nLi .\n\u2212 79\nIn order to have leptogenesis to occur, a non-zero lepton number asymmetry\nmust be generated and survive the evolution of the universe to convert to baryon\nnumber asymmetry. For this to happen there are 3 Sakharov conditions6 must be\nsatisfied: 1) Lepton number violation; 2) C and CP violation; and 3) Out of thermal\nequilibrium when 1) and 2) are in progress.\nIn the See-Saw models, lepton number is violated by the Majorana mass term\nfor heavy neutrino N . When a heavy neutrino N decays, it generates lepton number\nasymmetry \u01ebN if there is CP violation in the interaction.

This makes it easier to have large efficiency factor \u03b7 compared with Type I See-Saw where the heavy neutrinos have no gauge\ninteractions. In Fig. 2 we show the efficiency factor obtained in Refs. 7 and 8 .\nFor hierarchical heavy lepton case, in order to reproduce the observed baryon\nasymmetry, the lightest heavy lepton must satisfy M1 > 1010 GeV. Leptogenesis\nworks in Type III See-Saw. Although satisfactory for leptogenesis, this scenario\nmakes the See-Saw scale irrelevant for LHC study ad therefore difficult to test the\nmodel. However, in the M1 and M2 degenerate case, CP asymmetry \u01eb1 can be of\norder one, there is the possibility to allow M1 as low as 1 TeV as can be seen from\nthe left figure in Fig. 2. This makes it possible to test leptogenesis in Type III\nSee-Saw at LHC.\nIt has recently been point out that charged particle annihilation at nonrelativistic speed, due to the Coulomb interaction, the cross section is enhanced\nby the Sommerfeld effect. This effect makes washout stronger leading to the need\nof a larger M1 to realize successful leptogenesis. The resulting efficiency factor \u03b7\nis shown by the figure on the right in Fig. 2. It can be seen that M1 is raised to\nbe larger than a minimal value of8 1.6 TeV. Whether this is a robust lower bound\nremain to be studied since flavor dependent leptogenesis9 has not been included.\nThe inclusion of this may lower the M1 mass somewhat.\n3. Type III See-Saw at LHC\nThe LHC is now ready to take data. It has the potential to test many of the models\nbeyond the SM. It is a very exciting period for particle physics.

Even more interesting is that in Type III See-Saw\nheavy neutrinos as low as a TeV in mass can explain baryon asymmetry in our\nuniverse. There is a chance to directly test leptogenesis hypothesis too.\nAs far as detection of See-Saw heavy neutrino is concerned, the Type III See-Saw\nhas some advantages compared with Type I See-Saw. In Type III See-Saw, besides\nheavy neutral Majorana particle N 0 , there are also heavy charged particles E \u00b1 .\nThey have gauge interactions and are much easier than the singlet heavy neutrino\nmodel to be studied at LHC.\nWhether the heavy triplet leptons can be discovered depends on many things.\nFirst one must consider the production rate of the heavy triplet leptons.

We have calculated\nthe production cross sections for heavy triplet particle masses up to 2 TeV at LHC\nwhich are shown in Fig. 3. We see that the cross sections are not negligibly small.\nIt may be able to produce a lot of these particles.\nTo be sure that the triplet leptons are produced, one has to study the decays to\nspecify detection signals.

Since to have low mass leptogenesis, large CP\nviolation in heavy neutrino decays are needed, the study of CP violation at LHC\nshould be a good test for leptogenesis.\nOf course, one has to be open minded that See-Saw III does not have to do\nall jobs. If nature choose it to do just the See-Saw mechanism job with a mass\nlower than required by leptogenesis, and to be detected at LHC, we are already\nluck enough.\nThe E \u2212 in many ways is similar to a 4th generation charged lepton. One can,\nhowever, distinguish them by looking at the branching ratio for E \u00b1 \u2192 l\u00b1 Z. If it is\na 4th generation charged lepton, the branching ratio is expected to be much smaller\nthan that from the heavy triplet charged lepton.\n4. Conclusions\nThere are different ways the See-Saw mechanism can be realized. The Type III\nSee-Saw is a very simple mechanism for light neutrino masses. Compared with\nType I See-Saw, the heavy neutrinos introduced to do the See-Saw job have their\ncharged partners. These particles have SM gauge interactions resulting in many\ninteresting new features. In this talk we have reviewed some interesting results\nrelated to leptogenesis and collider physics at LHC.\nThe SM gauge interactions enable the heavy triplet particle to be in thermal\nequilibrium with other SM particle making the initial abundance of the heavy particle much more certain to calculate. These gauge interactions drop with temperature quickly leading to out of thermal decay of the lightest heavy triplet particle to\neasily produce large enough lepton number violation capable of explaining baryon\nasymmetry via leptogenesis, and the mass of the heavy neutrino can be as low as\na TeV in the degenerate case. This last possibility also makes it possible to study\nleptogenesis at LHC.\nThe production and detection are also much easier than Type I See-Saw due to\nthe existence of gauge interactions. Heavy neutrinos and their partners as heavy as\na TeV can be produced and detected at LHC when the integrated luminosity reach\n300 fb\u22121 . Up to 300 GeV can be detected with 30fb\u22121 integrated luminosity.\nIt is interesting to study CP violation at LHC since the low mass leptogenesis\nrequires a large CP violation in heavy neutrino decays. This may provide a unique\ntest for leptogenesis at LHC.\nIn this talk, we have not discussed many other interesting features of the Type\nIII See-Saw. One of these is the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions\nin lepton sector. The introduction of triplet leptons will induce FCNC at tree level\nfor charged lepton interactions, but not for quarks. Study of signals of FCNC in\nlepton sector and low energy processes may provide useful information to distinguish\ndifferent models12,13,14 . There are also several studies regarding extended model\nbuildings15 and other related issues16 . The Type III See-Saw and related models\nshould be studied more theoretically to reveal its interesting features, and of course\n\n\fNovember 8, 2018 0:50 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n10\n\ncospa-08 \u0307final\n\nXiao-Gang He\n\nexperimentally to decide whether it is relevant to reality.\nAcknowledgments This work was supported in part by NSC and NCTS.\nReferences\n1.
