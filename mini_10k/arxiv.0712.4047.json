Introduction\nThe statistical property of electron transport in a disordered quantum wire is independent of microscopic details of the system, and is mainly determined by the symmetries the\nsystem possesses.1 In ordinary disordered systems, only time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries play a relevant role. According to the presence or absence of these two symmetries,\ndisordered quantum wires are classified into either of the three standard universality classes\n(i.e., orthogonal, unitary and symplectic). The orthogonal class consists of systems having\nboth time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries, while the unitary class is characterized by\nthe absence of time-reversal symmetry. The systems having time reversal-symmetry without\nspin-rotation symmetry belong to the symplectic class. It has been believed that although details of transport properties differ from class to class, Anderson localization inevitably arises\nin all the three standard classes (i.e., the conductance decays exponentially with increasing\nsample length L and eventually vanishes in the limit of L \u2192 \u221e). However, this widely accepted understanding dose not always hold true. Recent studies on the symplectic universality\n\nclass show that if the number of conducting channels is odd, one channel becomes perfectly\nconducting without backward scattering.2\u20138 Due to the presence of this perfectly conducting\nchannel, the dimensionless conductance behaves as g \u2192 1 with increasing L, and thereby An-\n\nderson localization disappears. In contrast to this, such an anomalous behavior does not arise\n\n1/20\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nin the ordinary case with an even number of conducting channels. Thus, we must separate\nthe symplectic class into two subclasses of symplectic-even and symplectic-odd according to\nwhether the number of conducting channels is even or odd.3, 7\nThe realization of the symplectic-odd class revives attention to disordered wire systems\nwith the channel-number imbalance between two-propagating directions. More than a decade\nago, Barnes, Johnson and Kirczenow9 pointed out that if the number of conducting channels in\none propagating direction is by m greater than that in the opposite direction, the dimensionless\nconductances g for the majority direction and g\u2032 for the minority direction satisfy g = g \u2032 + m.\nPerforming a numerical simulation, they obtained evidence that g \u2192 m and g \u2032 \u2192 0 in the\n\nlong-L limit. This indicates that m perfectly conducting channels are present only in the\nmajority direction. Note that the channel-number imbalance leads to the breaking of timereversal symmetry, so that their argument applies only to the unitary class. Recently, Hirose,\nOhtuski and Slevin10 have proposed the Chalker-Coddington model11 with an odd-number of\n\nedge channels and studied its electron transport properties. The Chalker-Coddington model\ncan be viewed as a stacking of alternating left-moving and right-moving chiral edge channels\nwith random tunneling between adjacent ones.12 It should be noted that in the odd-edge\ncase, the channel number in one propagating direction is by one greater than that in the\nopposite direction. This situation is equivalent to that in the case of m = 1 considered in\nref. 9. Performing a numerical simulation, they also confirmed that g \u2192 1 and g\u2032 \u2192 0 in the\nlong-L limit.\n\nOne may think that the channel-number imbalance is rather unrealistic in actual systems.\nHowever, Wakabayashi et al.13 have recently shown that such a system can be realized in zigzag\nnanographene ribbons.14 Inspired by this observation, the present author and Wakabayashi15\nhave formulated a random-matrix theory for the unitary universality class with the channelnumber imbalance. Let us focus on a disordered wire system of length L having N + m leftmoving channels and N right-moving channels. In this case, m left-moving channels become\nperfectly conducting and the dimensionless conductances g and g \u2032 for the left-moving and\nright-moving channels, respectively, satisfy g = g\u2032 + m. They have derived the DorokhovMello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation, which describes the evolution of the probability\ndistribution for transmission eigenvalues with increasing L,16, 17 and analyzed the asymptotic\nbehavior of g\u2032 = g \u2212 m in the long-L regime by using an approximate method proposed by\n\nPichard.18 They have shown that the localization length \u03be, which characterizes the exponential\n\ndecay of exp[hln g\u2032 i], depends on m as \u03be = 2N l/(m + 1), where l is the mean free path for\nthe left-moving channels. That is, \u03be decreases with increasing the number m of perfectly\n\nconducting channels. This means that the presence of perfectly conducting channels suppresses\ng \u2032 . Furthermore, they have also shown that the average and second moment of g\u2032 behave\ns\n\nms\n\nas hg\u2032 i \u223c e\u2212 4N for m = 0, hg \u2032 i \u223c e\u2212 N for m \u2265 1, hg\u2032 2 i \u223c e\u2212\n\n2/20\n\n(m+1)2 s\n4N\n\nfor 0 \u2264 m \u2264 3,\n\n\fJ.

To examine these results in terms of\n\nan independent approach, the present author and Wakabayashi19 have studied the averaged\n\nconductance hg\u2032 i in the three-edge Chalker-Coddington model, i.e., the simplest nontrivial\n\nexample of the channel-number-imbalanced unitary class with m = 1. They have found that\ns\n\nhg \u2032 i \u223c e\u2212 N , which is consistent with the DMPK result. Although this supports the validity\n\nof the DMPK approach, a more detailed comparison is highly desirable to deeply understand\nthe nature of this peculiar universality class.\nIn this paper, we study the average and second moment of the dimensionless conductance\ng \u2032 for the channel-number-imbalanced unitary class. First, we obtain the asymptotic forms\nof hg\u2032 i and hg \u2032 2 i in the long-L regime for 0 \u2264 m \u2264 4 by using the existing exact solution20\nof the DMPK equation. The exact solution, which is available only in the unitary class,21\nenables us to obtain the full asymptotic forms including a pre-exponential factor.22 Second,\nwe employ the M -edge Chalker-Coddington model for the cases of M = 2 and M = 3, and\nobtain hg \u2032 i and hg\u2032 2 i in the long-L regime by using a supersymmetry approach.23 The M = 2\ncase is the simplest example of the ordinary unitary class, while the M = 3 case is that of\n\nthe channel-number-imbalanced unitary class. We obtain the full asymptotic forms of hg \u2032 i\n\nand hg \u2032 2 i including a pre-exponential factor. We show that the resulting asymptotic forms are\nidentical to those obtained from the DMPK equation. This strongly supports the validity of\nthe DMPK approach.\nIn the next section, we introduce the DMPK equation for the channel-number-imbalanced\nunitary class and introduce its exact solution. We obtain the average hg\u2032 i and second moment\n\nhg \u2032 2 i of the dimensionless conductance g\u2032 in the long-L regime using the exact solution. In \u00a73,\nwe introduce the M -edge Chalker-Coddington model and obtain hg\u2032 i and hg\u2032 2 i for the cases\nof M = 2 and M = 3. Section 4 is devoted to summary.\n2. DMPK Approach\n\nWe summarize the random-matrix theory for the channel-number-imbalanced unitary\nclass.15 We consider the case in which the number of left-moving channels is N + m,\nwhile that of right-moving channels is N . In this case, we can show that m transmission eigenvalues in the left-moving channels become unity.9, 10, 15 This indicates the presence of perfectly conducting channels. If the set of the transmission eigenvalues for the\nright-moving channels is {T1 , T2 , . . . , TN }, that for the left-moving channels is expressed as\n\n{T1 , T2 , . . . , TN , 1, . . . , 1}, where we have identified the N + 1 to N + mth channels as the per-\n\nfectly conducting ones. The dimensionless conductance g for the left-moving channels is given\nPN +m\nP\nPN\n\u2032\nby g = a=1\nTa = m + N\na=1 Ta , while that for the right-moving channels is g =\na=1 Ta .\n\nIt is easy to observe that g = g\u2032 + m. We consider the behavior of g\u2032 = g \u2212 m as a function\nof the normalized system length s \u2261 L/l, where l is the mean free path for the left-moving\n\nchannels. It should be noted that the mean free path l\u2032 for the right-moving channels is not\n\n3/20\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nequal to l due to the presence of perfectly conducting channels only in the left-moving channels. Indeed, we find that l\u2032 = (N/(N + m))l. We define \u03bba \u2261 (1 \u2212 Ta )/Ta and introduce\nthe probability distribution P ({\u03bba }; s) for the transmission eigenvalues. The Fokker-Planck\nequation for P ({\u03bba }; s), which is usually called the DMPK equation, is expressed as15\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\nN\n1 X \u2202\nP ({\u03bba }; s)\n\u2202\n\u2202P ({\u03bba }; s)\n=\n\u03bba (1 + \u03bba )J\n\u2202s\nN a=1 \u2202\u03bba\n\u2202\u03bba\nJ\n\n(1)\n\nwith\n\nJ=\n\nN\nY\n\nc=1\n\nAs stressed in ref. 15, the factor\n\n\u03bbm\nc \u00d7\n\nQN\n\nm\nc=1 \u03bbc\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\nN\nY\n\nb=1 a=b+1\n\n|\u03bba \u2212 \u03bbb |2 .\n\n(2)\n\nin J represents the repulsion arising from the m-\n\nfold degenerate perfectly conducting eigenvalue.

It should be mentioned that the equivalent DMPK equation\n\nwas proposed by Akuzawa and Wadati20 in a rather formal context, but they did not study\nelectron transport properties.\nThe DMPK equation has been solved exactly for the ordinary case of m = 0.21, 22 The\nexact solution for an arbitrary m has been obtained in ref. 20.

Chalker-Coddington Model\n\nWe consider an electron system consisting of M chiral edge channels as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe propagating direction of the jth edge channel is left (right) if j is odd (even), and each\nedge is coupled with adjacent counter-propagating edge(s) by random tunneling. Note that\nthis system is essentially equivalent to the Chalker-Coddington model. We assume that the\nelectron wavefunction \u03c6j (x) for the jth edge channel with energy \u03b5 obeys12, 23\n(\u22121)j (\u2212i)\u2202x \u03c6j (x) + tj (x)\u03c6j+1 (x) + t\u2217j\u22121 (x)\u03c6j\u22121 (x) = \u03b5\u03c6j (x),\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03c60 (x) = \u03c6M +1 (x) \u2261 0 has been assumed. Here, tj (x) and t\u2217j (x) represent the tunneling\n\namplitude from the jth edge to j + 1th edge and that for the reverse process, respectively. We\n\nassume that {tj (x)} are random variables in the disordered region of 0 < x < L, and vanish\n\noutside this region. We regard L as the length of our system, and the clean regions of x \u2264 0\n\nand L \u2264 x play a role of the left and right electrodes, respectively. The random amplitudes\n\nin the disordered region are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero means. That is,\nhtj (x)i = 0, htj (x)tj \u2032 (x\u2032 )i = 0 and\nhtj (x)t\u2217j \u2032 (x\u2032 )i = D\u03b4j,j \u2032 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n8/20\n\n(45)\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

Schematic sketch of the Chalker-Coddington model for (a) the two-edge case of M = 2 and\n(b) the three-edge case of M = 3.\n\nwhere h* * * i represents the ensemble average. We hereafter set \u03b5 = 0 without loss of generality.\n\nThe dimensionless conductance g for the left-moving channels is expressed as g =\n\nP\n\ni,j=odd Tij ,\n\nwhere Tij is the transmission probability for an electron incoming from the\n\njth channel in the right electrode and outgoing to the ith channel in the left electrode. In a\nP\nmanner similar to this, g\u2032 for the right-moving channels is expressed as g\u2032 = i,j=even Tij . The\ndimensionless conductances satisfy g = g \u2032 in the ordinary case of an even M . In the odd-M\n\ncase, which is first studied by Hirose, Ohtuski and Slevin,10 the number of the left-moving\nchannels is by one greater than that of the right-moving channels, so that one left-moving\nchannel becomes perfectly conducting. In this case, we observe that g = 1 + g\u2032 . We consider\nthe two-edge case of M = 2 and the three-edge case of M = 3 in the following. In the notation\nused in the previous section, the former and latter correspond to the cases of N = 1 with\nm = 0 and N = 1 with m = 1, respectively. The three-edge case of M = 3 is the simplest\nnontrivial example of the disordered wires with the channel-number imbalance. Hereafter, we\nagain explicitly show the number m of perfectly conducting channels as a subscript of g\u2032 . We\nfocus on the average and second moment of g \u2032 m (m = 0, 1) as a function of L. Note that\ng \u2032 m = T22 in the two- and three-edge cases, in which only one right-moving channel exists.\nMathur has shown for the M = 2 case that23, 25\n5\n\nhg\u2032 0 i =\n\n1\n\u03c02\n\u2212 DL\nq 3e 4\n16 DL\n\n(46)\n\n4\n\nin the asymptotic regime of DL \u226b 1. This result is identical to eq. (18) in the case of N = 1 if\nwe replace DL by s. This indicates that D \u22121 should be identified with the mean free path  \u0303l for\nthe M = 2 case. In the M = 3 case, each left-moving edge channel is directly coupled to one\nright-moving edge channel as in the case of M = 2, so the mean free path for the left direction\n\n9/20\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nis equal to  \u0303\nl under the condition of eq. (45). However, because the right-moving channel\ninteracts with the two left-moving channels, the corresponding mean free path becomes half\nof  \u0303l. Thus, for comparison with the argument in \u00a72, in which the system length is normalized\nby the mean free path for the left-moving channels, we hereafter adopt D \u22121 as the unit length\nscale common to both the cases of M = 2 and 3. This is simply achieved by the replacement\nDL \u2192 s.\n\nWe obtain the asymptotic forms of hg\u2032 20 i, hg \u2032 1 i and hg\u2032 21 i by adapting the supersymmetry\n\napproach presented by Mathur.23 The supersymmetry approach enables us to express the av-\n\nerage and second moment of the transmission probability in the from of a correlation function\nfor a non-random interacting fermion-boson system on a one-dimensional chain. For the twoedge (three-edge) case, we need to consider the two-site (three-site) chain which we describe\nbelow. Let ci\u03c3 (c\u2020i\u03c3 ) be the fermion annihilation (creation) operator, and bi\u03c3 (b\u2020i\u03c3 ) be the boson\nannihilation (creation) operator, where i = 1, 2, 3 represents the site number and \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193. The\n\nsites are one-to-one correspondence with the edge channels in the original model. The Hamil-\n\ntonian H for the two-edge case is identical to H12 which represents the interaction between\nthe 1st and 2nd sites. The Hamiltonian for the three-edge case is given by H = H12 + H23 ,\nwhere H23 represents the interaction between the 2nd and 3rd sites.

Summary\nWe have studied electron transport properties in disordered unitary wires of length L\nin the presence of the channel-number imbalance between two propagating directions. Our\nattention is focused on the case in which the number of left-moving channels is by m greater\nthan that of the right-moving ones. In this case, m left-moving channels become perfectly\nconducting and the dimensionless conductances g and g\u2032 for the left-moving and right-moving\nchannels, respectively, satisfy g = g \u2032 + m. First, we have obtained the average hg\u2032 i and second\nmoment hg\u2032 2 i of g \u2032 = g \u2212 m in the long-L regime by using the exact solution of the DMPK\n\nequation. Both hg \u2032 i and hg\u2032 2 i decay exponentially as a function of L. It is shown that their\n\nexponential decay becomes faster with increasing m. This behavior can be understood from the\n\nfact that the eigenvalue repulsion arising from the perfectly conducting eigenvalue is enhanced\n\n13/20\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

Second, we have employed the M -edge Chalker-Coddington model for the\ncases of M = 2 and M = 3, and obtained hg \u2032 i and hg\u2032 2 i in the long-L regime by using the\n\nsupersymmetry approach. The case of M = 3 corresponds to the simplest nontrivial example\nof the channel-number-imbalanced unitary class. We have shown that the resulting asymptotic\n\nforms of hg \u2032 i and hg\u2032 2 i are identical to those obtained from the DMPK equation including the\npre-exponential factor.\n\nAppendix A: Derivation of the Scaling Relation\nThe average of a function F ({\u03bba }) is defined as\nZ \u221e\nd\u03bb1 * * * \u03bbN F ({\u03bba })P ({\u03bba }, s).\nhF i =\n\n(A*1)\n\n0\n\nUsing the DMPK equation given in eq.
