Introduction\nFor many beyond standard models, discrete symmetries are invaluable ingredients to make\nthe models phenomenologically viable. For example, in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), R-parity [1] is usually assumed for the proton stability. R-parity\nalso guarantees the stability of the lightest superparticle (LSP), which can be a good dark\nmatter candidate. It is argued, however, that discrete symmetries are vulnerable to Planck\nscale physics unless they have a gauge origin [2]. An extra Abelian gauge symmetry is\nalso predicted in many new physics scenarios such as superstring, extra dimension, little\nHiggs, and grand unification. Therefore, it would be useful to understand what discrete\nsymmetries are allowed as a residual discrete symmetry of the extra U (1) gauge symmetry.\nThe first systematic study of the U (1) residual discrete symmetry in a supersymmetry\n(SUSY) framework was performed by Ibanez and Ross [3], where they found 3 independent\ngenerators RN , LN , and AN . They studied all possible Z2 and Z3 discrete symmetries from\na U (1), and found that R2 (matter parity, which is equivalent to R-parity) as well as another\nZ3 symmetry can be a residual discrete symmetry of the gauge symmetry, a.k.a. a discrete\ngauge symmetry. Complementary and general discrete symmetries (ZN with N > 3) with\na U (1) origin were also studied [4,5]. In a special case where the \u03bc-problem [6] is addressed\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fby a TeV scale U (1), the discrete symmetries were investigated in Refs. [7, 8], which allow\nR-parity violating U (1) models without fast proton decay.\nNevertheless, these discrete symmetries concerned only the observable sector (or the\nMSSM sector). Many theories need exotic chiral fields for various reasons. For example, the\nSUSY breaking mechanism requires additional fields. Also exotic fields are often necessary\nto make the model anomaly free when an additional gauge symmetry is added. Even when\nthey do not have standard model (SM) charges, such hidden sector fields may have charges\nunder the extra U (1) gauge symmetry. The SM neutral hidden sector fields can be natural\ndark matter candidates if they are stable.\nIt was shown that the same U (1) symmetry that provides the discrete symmetry for\nthe MSSM sector can also be the source of the discrete symmetry for the hidden sector\nsimultaneously [9]. Another independent generator UN was introduced for the hidden\nsector discrete symmetry. The lightest U -parity particle (LUP) from the hidden sector is\nstable under the U2 (U -parity), and it was shown that the experimental constraints from\nthe relic density and the direct detection can be satisfied in a large parameter space with\nthe LUP dark matter candidate [10].\nHowever, the study in Ref. [9] was not completely general since the hidden sector field\nwas assumed to be Majorana with SXX as a mass term, and only the factorizable extension\nobs \u00d7 Z hid was exploited. In this paper, we first generalize the discussion by including\nZN\nN2\n1\nthe Dirac type hidden sector fields and possible nonrenormalizable mass terms. Dirac type\nfields allow a discrete symmetry UN (with N > 2) while Majorana type fields allow only U2 .\nThis leads to the possibility of multiple hidden sector dark matter candidates stable due to\nthe hidden sector discrete symmetry. We also start from the general form of the discrete\nsymmetry taking the factorizable case as a special limit. Then we present a method to\nconstruct the most general U (1) charges for a given discrete symmetry of the MSSM and\nhidden sector, with illustrations for specific examples. In Appendix A, we discuss the U (1)\norigin of the popular R-parity and its relation with the U (1) solution of the \u03bc-problem,\nwhich is one of the motivations to extend the supersymmetric standard model to include\nan extra U (1). In Appendix B, we discuss about the compatibility of discrete symmetries\nwith a leptonically coupling dark matter candidate.\n\n2. Residual discrete symmetries from the U (1) gauge symmetry\nIn this section, we review the general discrete symmetries in the MSSM sector, which are\nthe remnant of an Abelian gauge symmetry. Starting with a U (1) gauge symmetry which\nis broken spontaneously by a Higgs singlet S, one is generically left with a residual discrete\nZN symmetry. In a normalization where all particles Fi of the theory have integer U (1)\ncharges z[Fi ], the value of N is directly determined by\nN = |z[S]| .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe resulting discrete charges q[Fi ] of the fields Fi are then given by the mod N part of\ntheir original U (1) charges\nq[Fi ] = z[Fi ] mod N .\n(2.2)\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fBy definition the Higgs singlet S has vanishing discrete charge so that giving a vacuum\nexpectation value (vev) to S keeps the discrete ZN symmetry unbroken. Note that in\nthe case with N = 1, we formally obtain a Z1 which corresponds to no remnant discrete\nsymmetry.\nThe possible (family-independent) discrete symmetries of the MSSM1 which can emerge\nfrom an anomaly free U (1) gauge symmetry have been identified and investigated in\nRefs. [3\u20135]. Demanding ZN invariance of the MSSM superpotential operators\nW\u03bc = \u03bcHu Hd ,\nWYukawa =\n\n(2.3)\n\nD\nHd Qj Dkc\nyjk\n\n+\n\nU\nHu Qj Ukc\nyjk\n\n+\n\nE\nHd Lj Ekc\nyjk\n\n+\n\nN\nHu Lj Nkc\nyjk\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\none can express any discrete symmetry among the MSSM particles in terms of the two\ngenerators\nRN = e2\u03c0i(qR /N ) ,\nLN = e2\u03c0i(qL /N ) ,\n(2.5)\nwhere the charges qR and qL are defined in Table 1. Different discrete symmetries of\nthe observable sector are then obtained by multiplying various integer powers of these\ngenerators\nm p\nobs\nLN .\n(2.6)\n= RN\ngN\nCompared to Refs. [3, 4], the generator AN , which gives nonzero discrete charge to only\none of the two Higgs doublets, is omitted because its presence would forbid the \u03bc term in\nEq. (2.3). As the invariance of Hu Hd under ZN requires opposite discrete charges for Hu\nand Hd , one can always find an equivalent set of discrete charges by adding some amount\nof hypercharge y[Hi ] such that q \u2032 [Hi ] = q[Hi ] + \u03b1y[Hi ] = 0 simultaneously for i = u, d.\nThus requiring the existence of the \u03bc term guarantees the absence of domain walls after\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking.\nA more intuitive way of writing Eq. (2.6) is obtained by defining the generator BN =\nRN LN . The discrete charges qB of the MSSM fields under BN are related to the familiar\nbaryon number (B) by the hypercharge shift\n1\nqB [Fi ] = \u2212B[Fi ] + y[Fi ] .\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere the hypercharge is normalized so that y[Q] = 1. On the other hand, the discrete\ncharges qL of the MSSM fields under LN are nothing but the negative of the lepton number\n(L)\nqL [Fi ] = \u2212L[Fi ] .\n(2.8)\nHence, the general discrete symmetry of Eq. (2.6), written in terms of BN and LN ,\nobs\nobs\nb l\nZN\n: gN\n= BN\nLN ,\n\n(2.9)\n\ncan be understood in terms of the well-known baryon number and lepton number, with a\ndiscrete charge\nq = bqB + lqL mod N = \u2212bB \u2212 lL + b(y/3) mod N .\n1\n\nWe include 3 right-handed neutrinos N c which do not change our argument.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fThe exponents in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.9) are related to each other by m = b and p = b + l.\nSpecific values for b and l define a ZN symmetry of the MSSM particles for which the\nquantity Q = bB + lL mod N is conserved. The lightest particle with nonzero Q value will\nbe stable by the discrete symmetry. The following discrete symmetries are some examples\nobtained for given b and l values.\n(b, l; N )\n\nobs\ngN\n\nQ\n\n(1, 0; N )\n\nBN\n\nB mod N\n\n(0, 1; N )\n\nLN\n\nL mod N\n\n(1, 1; N )\n\nBN L N\n\n(B + L) mod N\n\n(1, \u22121; N )\n\nBN L\u22121\nN\n\n(B \u2212 L) mod N\n\nNote that with N = 2 the symmetry in the last line (B2 L\u22121\n2 ) corresponds to matter parity\nB\u2212L\n3(B\u2212L)\nbecause (\u22121)\n= (\u22121)\nfor any SU (3)C invariant term for which B is always an\ninteger. As long as the spin angular momentum is conserved, matter parity is equivalent\nto R-parity, Rp = (\u22121)3(B\u2212L)+2s .\nThe discussion so far has been completely independent of any assumptions about the\norigin of the discrete symmetry. Requiring that the ZN arises as a remnant of an anomaly\nfree U (1) gauge symmetry, we have to impose the discrete anomaly conditions of Ref. [3]\n(Note the cubic anomaly condition is disregarded [11].)\nX\nqi = N * Z ,\n(2.11)\n[SU (3)C ]2 \u2212 U (1) :\ni=3,3\n\n2\n\n[SU (2)L ] \u2212 U (1) :\n\nX\n\nqi = N * Z ,\n\n(2.12)\n\n(\n\n(2.13)\n\ni=2\n\n[gravity]2 \u2212 U (1) :\n\nX\n\nqi =\n\ni\n\nN * Z (N = odd) ,\nN\n2\n\n* Z (N = even) ,\n\nwhere the sums run over MSSM particles only. Additional exotic fields which may or may\nnot be singlets under the SM gauge group SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y do not contribute to\nthese anomaly conditions as long as they acquire a mass term when U (1) is broken, i.e. if\nthey are vectorlike under the SM gauge groups, while they are not under the U (1).\nThe consequence of Eqs. (2.11) - (2.13) is that some sets of parameters (b, l; N ) correspond to ZN symmetries which are discrete anomaly free while others are anomalous and\nb automatically\ntherefore ruled out (see Refs. [3\u20135]). For instance, the symmetries of type BN\nsatisfy Eqs. (2.11) and (2.13) for all N and b. However, Eq. (2.12) yields the nontrivial\nconstraint\nX\nqi = b {Nf (3qB [Q] + qB [L]) + NH (qB [Hu ] + qB [Hd ])}\n(2.14)\ni=2\n\n= \u2212bNf = 0 mod N ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere Nf and NH denote the number of families of fermions and Higgs pairs, respectively.\nFor Nf = 3, we obtain only b = 0, \u00b1N/3 as allowed choices for the cyclic symmetry.

Hidden sector discrete symmetries\nWe now wish to extend the concept of discrete symmetries to the hidden sector or the\n\u2032\nSM neutral particles.2 To do so, we introduce the generators Ua,N and Ua,N\nwhich assign\nnontrivial discrete charges to, respectively, the Majorana (Xb ) and the Dirac (Tb , Tbc )\nparticles of the hidden sector while the MSSM fields remain uncharged. Note that we label\nhidden sector fields by indices (a, b, etc) which can refer to fields with different or identical\n(i.e. family) U (1) charges.\n\u2032\nThe generators Ua,N , Ua,N\nas well as RN , LN , and BN \u2013 extended to include the\nhidden sector particles \u2013 are shown in Table 1.

This decomposition is only possible if N1 and N2 have no common prime\nfactor, i.e. they must be coprime to each other.

Similarly T1\nis stable because it is the only Z5 charged particle. Finally, the symmetry Z4 stabilizes the\nlighter of the two particles X and T2 . If this is T2 , then there is no more particle stable due\nto the discrete symmetry. In that way, it is possible that different Znk symmetries stabilize\nthe same particle.\nThe important point in this discussion is that a single U (1) gauge symmetry can\neffectively give rise to more than one discrete symmetry. One part of it might be used to\nforbid unwanted processes involving the MSSM fields only, while other parts lead to stable\nhidden sector particles, i.e. multiple dark matter candidates.4 This setup is schematically\nsketched in Figure 1. The discussion here is basically a generalization of that of Ref. [9],\nwhich dealt with only the Majorana case with a specific SXX mass term.\nAn example of the purely hidden sector discrete symmetry in the non-SUSY case can\nbe found in Ref. [13], where an additional U (1) was introduced to explain the neutrino\nmass and dark matter simultaneously.\nqZhid\n[T2 ] = 35 = \u2212\n60\n\n3\n\nP\nIf there were a second charge assignment q\u0303Zn [Tb ] for the same value of \u2212u\u2032b /N1 , the sum k (qZn [Tb ]\u2212\nk\nk\nq\u0303Zn [Tb ])/nk would have to be integer.

To be as general as possible we do not consider these full\ngauge anomaly conditions in this paper. However, see Refs. [7, 14\u201318] for some examples.\nNote that Eq.

This general charge assignment is consistent with the\nfollowing well-known fact: assuming (i) Yukawa couplings with u\ne = de = ee = n\ne = 0,\n(ii) no SM-charged particles other than quarks and leptons, (iii) vanishing of the mixed\nanomalies [SU (3)C ]2 \u2212 U (1) (yielding p = \u22121, see discussion in Ref.

A TeV scale Z \u2032\nhas implications also in cosmology such as providing a venue so that the right-handed\nsneutrino LSP dark matter candidate or the LUP dark matter candidate can be a thermal\ndark matter candidate through the Z \u2032 resonance [10, 21]. See Ref. [22] for a review of this\nmodel. It might appear that this type of U (1) cannot have matter parity (R-parity) as its\nresidual discrete symmetry, but there are ways to achieve this (see Appendix A).\n\n5. Construction of the U (1) charges for a given discrete symmetry\nWe discuss how to construct the most general U (1) charges, which have a given discrete\nsymmetry as its residual symmetry. The SM-charged exotics are highly model-dependent\nand they may be obtained by scanning (see e.g. Refs. [7, 8]). Here, we limit ourselves only\nto the MSSM particles and the SM-singlet exotics (X, T ). The specific discrete symmetries\nwe want to cover in this paper are listed in Table 2. An overall sign change does not affect\nthe discrete symmetry.\n6\n\nSee Appendix B for further discussion related to DAMA/PAMELA results.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fThe general U (1) charges, before any discrete symmetry is assumed, are given in\nEq. (4.11). Integer normalization is achieved through the coefficient \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. Then,\nN of ZN is determined by z[S] fixing also the parameter \u03b3 = N as shown in Eq. (4.15).\nSince invariance under a hypercharge transformation is implicitly assumed throughout the\npaper, the hypercharge column (with coefficient \u03b2) of Eq. (4.11) has no effect on the\ndiscrete symmetry. However, in order to obtain integer U (1) charges, \u03b2 must be chosen in\na particular way.\nAs a general procedure, we suggest the following:\n(i) Take \u03b3 = N of ZN .\n(ii) Identify some terms which are allowed by the given discrete symmetry as well as the\nSM gauge group.\n(iii) Extract an additional condition about the U (1) charges from these allowed terms\n(MSSM sector only).\n(iv) Using this additional relation, obtain the U (1) charges from Eq. (4.11), the most\ngeneral U (1) charge assignments before imposing any particular discrete symmetry.\n(v) Require the U (1) charges to be integer.\nThe resulting set of equation is the most general U (1) solution that contains the given\ndiscrete symmetry, up to arbitrary hypercharge shift and scaling.

(5.7) is satisfied, the discrete charges can be easily read off from Eq. (5.6) by\ndisregarding the hypercharge column and then applying Eq. (2.2) to the remaining two\nvectors. The result is B3 , which becomes evident by comparing the third column to the\ne ee, n\ncharges of B3 in Table 2. Note that the discrete symmetry is independent of n and u\ne, d,\ne.\nIt is also independent of p as long as Eq. (5.7) is satisfied for a given \u03b4.\nUsing Eq. (4.15), we can rewrite the condition of Eq. (5.7) as\n3z[Q] + z[L] = 3 * Z \u00b1 1 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhich forbids the operator QQQL effectively. This shows that B3 arises automatically as\na residual discrete symmetry of the U (1) if we require both:\n1. presence of an (S/M )n LLE c term (or any effective renormalizable L violating term),\n2. absence of an (S/M )m QQQL term (for any integer m).\nAssuming \u03b4 = 0, NH = 1, and Nf = 3, the second requirement is equivalent to the\nrequirement of the presence of an effective \u03bc term (S/M )p SHu Hd with p = 3 * Z or 3 * Z + 1.\nThe p = 0 case with an effective \u03bc term (SHu Hd ) can belong to this category. In the\nMSSM-like case with an original \u03bc term (Hu Hd ), i.e. p = \u22121 case, we need nonvanishing\ncontributions from SU (2)L exotics (\u03b4 6= 0) in order to have B3 as a residual discrete\nsymmetry.\nThe discrete charges are given by q = qB = \u2212B + y/3 mod 3. Since the hypercharge\nis conserved by itself, the quantity which is conserved by B3 is B mod 3, dictating the\nselection rule\n\u2206B = 0 mod 3 .\n(5.9)\nHence, proton decay (\u2206B = 1) and neutron-antineutron oscillation (\u2206B = 2) are absolutely forbidden by the selection rule of B3 [23].\nUnless R-parity is separately imposed, this is an R-parity violating model. The violation of R-parity implies distinguishable phenomenology. See Refs. [24\u201329] for some\nimplications of the R-parity violation, for example. The proton is still protected by B3\neven better than by R-parity [30]. The dark matter issue still needs to be addressed.\n5.2 U (1) \u2192 Z6 = B3 \u00d7 U2\nHere we will consider the B3 symmetry for the MSSM sector, augmented with U -parity\n\u2032\nQ\nua \u2032 ub\n(U2 = a,b Ua,2\nUb,2 ) for the hidden sector.7\n(i) Z6 fixes \u03b3 = 6.\n7\n\nSee Ref.

Therefore, a symmetry of type B3 \u00d7 a Ua,2\narises automatically as a residual discrete symmetry of the U (1) if we require:\n1. presence of an (S/M )n LLE c term (or any effective renormalizable L violating term),\n2. absence of an (S/M )m QQQL term (for any integer m),\n\u0001\nS x\u0303a\n3. presence of an M\nSXa Xa term with x\u0303a = 0, 2, 4, * * * , resulting in Xa being odd\nunder U -parity.\nUnfortunately, the case where Tb has odd U -parity cannot be discussed in terms of requiring\nthe presence or absence of some effective operators as discussed above.\nThe discrete charges are given by q = 2qB + 3ua qUa + 3u\u2032b qUb\u2032 mod 6 = \u22122B + 2y/3 \u2212\n3ua Ua \u2212 3u\u2032b Ub\u2032 mod 6. Since the hypercharge is conserved by itself, the quantity which\nis conserved by B3 is B mod 3 and the one conserved by U -parity is ua Ua + u\u2032b Ub\u2032 mod 2,\ndictating the selection rules\n\u2206B = 0 mod 3 ,\n\n\u2206(ua Ua + u\u2032b Ub\u2032 ) = 0 mod 2 ,\n\n(5.19)\n\nwhich prevents the proton and the LUP from decaying. Therefore, R-parity is not necessary\nto address the stability of the proton and the dark matter candidate.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f5.3 U (1) \u2192 Z6 = B3 \u00d7 R2\nHere we will consider the B3 \u00d7 R2 symmetry for the MSSM sector without any hidden\n\u0001\nS n\nsector fields.8 As we can check with Table 2, this symmetry allows M\n(Hu L)2 which\ncan provide an additional condition.

Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper, we systematically studied the residual discrete symmetry of an extra Abelian\ngauge symmetry, which may interact with both the MSSM sector and the hidden sector.\nDespite a common gauge origin, the discrete symmetry can have important implications\nseparately for the observable and the hidden sector, such as the stability of the proton\nand dark matter. We provided the most general framework to discuss such a symmetry\nincluding Majorana type and Dirac type hidden sector fields.\nWe also argued how to construct the most general U (1) symmetry for the MSSM sector\nand hidden sector for a given discrete symmetry, illustrating our procedure for several\nexamples. Our results should be useful for U (1) model building. For example, in order to\nmake sure the proton and the Majorana hidden sector dark matter candidate are stable in\nthe absence of R-parity, one can, in a minimal framework with \u03b4 = 0, NH = 1, and Nf = 3,\njust require (i) SHu Hd (i.e. the effective \u03bc term that solves the \u03bc-problem with the U (1)\ngauge symmetry), (ii) LLE c (a renormalizable L violating term), and (iii) SXX (a mass\nterm for the Majorana hidden sector field X). Then, B3 and U -parity are automatically\ninvoked in the MSSM and the hidden sector, respectively, as a residual discrete symmetry\nof the common U (1) gauge symmetry (in the form of Z6 = B3 \u00d7 U2 ). Their selection rules\nensure absolute stability of the proton and the LUP dark matter.\nIn Appendix A, we investigated the cases in which the U (1) gauge symmetry that solves\nthe \u03bc-problem can contain matter parity (equivalent to R-parity) as a residual discrete\n8\n\nSee Ref. [4, 31] for details about this symmetry.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fsymmetry. This can provide a useful framework for R-parity conserving U (1) extended\nsupersymmetric models, without imposing a separate R-parity.\nIn Appendix B, we made a comment on the relation between the discrete symmetry and\nthe leptonically interacting LUP dark matter candidate, which has been recently focused\non due to the possibility of the simultaneous explanation of the DAMA modulation and\nthe PAMELA results.\n\nA. U (1) gauge origin of R-parity and the \u03bc-problem solution\nIn this appendix, we investigate the conditions under which the R2 matter parity (equivalent to the R-parity) can emerge as a residual discrete symmetry of the extra U (1) gauge\nsymmetry. The general U (1) charges of the MSSM sector and the hidden sector are given\nin Eq. (4.11). In order to unveil the discrete symmetry, let us introduce a new parameter\n\u03b2 \u2032 which is related to the original parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 by\n\u03b2\u2032 \u03b1\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n\u03b2\n=\n\u2212 \u2212\nNH (1 + p) +\n.\n6\n6\n3\n3Nf\n3Nf\n\n(A.1)\n\nUsing this definition, Eq. (4.11) can be rewritten to separate the columns into those which\ndo and which do not affect the discrete symmetry (in the RN and BN basis) among the\nMSSM fields. In the following, we do not consider the the hidden sector fields, which are\nirrelevant to our discussion.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n1\nz[Q]\n0\n\uf8ec \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u22124 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec z[U c ] \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212e\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec u + (1 + p) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u2212de\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2\uf8f7\n\uf8ec z[D c ] \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec z[L] \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u03b3NH (1 + p) \u2212 \u03b4 \uf8ec \u22121 \uf8f7 \u03b2 \u2032 \uf8ec \u22123 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2\uf8f7+ \uf8ec 6\uf8f7 + \u03b3 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec z[E c ] \uf8f7 = \u2212\u03b1 \uf8ec 1 \uf8f7 \u2212\n\u2212e\ne\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nNf\n\uf8ec 0\uf8f7 6 \uf8ec 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec z[N c ] \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212e\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec n + (1 + p) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 3\uf8f7\n\uf8ec z[Hu ] \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212(1 + p) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u22123 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed z[Hd ] \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0\uf8f8\nz[S]\n0\n0\n0\n1\n| {z }\n| {z }\nqR\n\nqB\n\n(A.2)\nAs mentioned before, the hypercharge (third) column does not influence the discrete symmetry at all since we require hypercharge shift invariance. The fourth column has no effect\non the discrete symmetry among the MSSM fields because their contributions to the U (1)\ncharges are integer multiples of \u03b3 = z[S] = N . Therefore only the first and the second column define the discrete symmetry among the MSSM fields. Comparing the entries of both\nvectors with the discrete charges of Table 1, we see that the first column corresponds to qR\nobs symmetry depends only on the coefficients\nand the second to qB . Hence, the type of ZN\n\u03b3NH (1+p)\u2212\u03b4\n. Our assumption of integer U (1) charges\nof these two vectors, namely on \u03b1 and\nNf\n\u2032\n\nrequires both to be integer. Note that \u03b26 is necessarily also integer and can be replaced by\nIQ (see step (v) of the examples in Section 5).\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fIn order to have a pure RN symmetry, the coefficient of qR should be \u00b11 mod N and\nthe coefficient of qB must vanish mod N , i.e.\n\u03b1=\u03b3 *Z\u00b11 ,\n\n\u03b3NH (1 + p) \u2212 \u03b4\n=\u03b3*Z .\nNf\n\n(A.3)\n\nWith p = \u22121, \u03b4 = 0, and u\ne = de = ee = n\ne = 0, we have only a mixtures of the U (1)B\u2212L\nand U (1)Y . It always has the pure RN symmetry as a residual discrete symmetry as long\nas \u03b1 = \u03b3 * Z \u00b1 1. With \u03b3 = 2, we obtain R2 parity. Relaxing u\ne = de = ee = n\ne = 0 does not\nchange the discrete symmetry.\nIn order to solve the \u03bc-problem with a TeV scale U (1) gauge symmetry, however, we\nshould take p = 0 (see Section 4). With Nf = 3, Eq. (A.3) can be written as\n\u03b4 = \u03b3(NH \u2212 3 * Z) .\n\n(A.4)\n\nTherefore we need additional SU (2)L exotic fields in the form of NH = 3 * Z generations\nobs = R\nof Higgs pairs or some exotic doublet contribution \u03b4, in order to have ZN\nN while\nsolving the \u03bc-problem with a common U (1) gauge symmetry.\nHowever, it should be mentioned that there is another way for the U (1) to be a solution\nto the \u03bc-problem while having matter parity as a residual discrete symmetry, which may\nnot require additional SU (2)L charged particles. If the total discrete symmetry in the\nobs = R \u00d7 Z\nMSSM sector has R2 as a part of it, i.e. ZN\n2\nN/2 (where 2 and N/2 are coprime),\nboth R2 and ZN/2 will be conserved independently. For instance, consider B3 \u00d7 R2 as the\nU (1) residual discrete symmetry as in Section 5.3. With Nf = 3 and NH = 1, and no\nSU (2)L exotics (\u03b4 = 0), Eq. (5.21) gives 1 + p = 3 * Z \u2213 1, which allows p = 0 to solve the\n\u03bc-problem. Hence, one U (1) gauge symmetry can be the common source of the \u03bc-problem\nsolution as well as R-parity.\n\nB. Leptonically coupling dark matter\nIt is worth to note that various coupling limits are still compatible with discrete symmetries.\nFor instance, consider the B3 \u00d7 U2 we studied in Section 5.2. The quark-phobic case\n(z[Q] = z[U c ] = z[D c ] = 0) requires \u03b4 = 6(Nf (de\u2212 ee + n) + NH (1 + p)) and u\ne + de = (1 + p),\nand IQ = 0. The lepton charges in this case, up to arbitrary scaling, are\nz[L] = \u22126(de\u2212 ee + n) ,\n\nz[E c ] = 6(2de\u2212 2e\ne + n) ,\n\nz[N c ] = 6(\u2212e\ne\u2212n\ne + n + (1 + p)) . (B.1)\n\nIn particular, a dark matter candidate that interacts with only leptons has been paid\ngood attention since it may be able to explain the DAMA annual modulation without\nmaking conflict with other direct detection experiments [32]. This kind of dark matter\nwould be consistent with the property that can naturally explain the PAMELA results\n(for example, see Ref. [33]). PAMELA showed a significant positron excess [34] but no\ndeviation in the proton/antiproton data [35]. Since the LUP dark matter, which is stable\nunder the U -parity, interacts with the gauge boson Z \u2032 of the U (1) gauge symmetry, the\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fquark-phobic case can satisfy this property. See Ref. [36] for an illustration how such a\ndark matter can explain the DAMA and PAMELA results.9\nAs B3 \u00d7 U2 is compatible with the quark-phobic case, the existence of such a dark\nmatter may not only explain the DAMA and PAMELA results but also suggests why the\nproton and dark matter are stable without introducing separate parities. This scenario\nmay be tested, for example, by the precise measurement of Z \u2032 coupling to leptons and\ncomparison with Eq. (B.1).\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to K. Matchev, S.
