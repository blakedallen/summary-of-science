Neutrino oscillation\nis an accepted fact and most of the parameters are now measured with a good accuracy.\nNevertheless important questions still remain: what is the nature of neutrino, is it a Dirac or a\nMajorana particle ? and what is its absolute mass ? Double beta decay experiments could solve\nthese 2 questions by detecting the 0 neutrino (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) mode. Such a decay would imply the non\nconservation of the leptonic number and the neutrino to be a Majorana particle.\nThe effective mass of the neutrino is directly related to the \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay rate and to the nuclear\nmatrix elements (NME) of the involved nuclei transition. NME are the main uncertainty in this\ncalculation and make difficult the possibility to compare experiments using different nuclei. In\norder to help theorists to contraint their models and converge to a unique solution, experimentalists need to give them as much data as possible. The \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd rate and spectra are of course a\nfruitful source of information but are even more useful when compared with the decay into the\nexcited states of the daughter nucleus. Indeed the behavior of NME parameter is completely\n\n\fdifferent for transition to the ground and excited states 1 .\nI will first say few words about double beta decay, then describe the NEMO3 detector, and\nfinally present the main results we obtained recently.\n2\n\nDouble beta decay\n\nThe main motivation of double beta decay experiments is the search of the neutrinoless mode :\n(A, Z) \u2192 (A, Z + 2) + 2e\u2212\nThe observation of this decay would imply the leptonic number violation and establish the\nMajorana nature of neutrino. The allowed 2 neutrinos mode, already observed for most of\ndouble beta decay nuclei, is also a source of interest and need to be studied in detail.\nSeveral processes could be responsible for the 0 neutrino mode. The simpliest and most likely\none is the exchange of a light neutrino between the two vertices. But \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay could also be\ncaused by (V+A) currents, Majoron emission or interaction involving supersymetric particles.\nIn any case we can constraint the effective neutrino mass as function of the decay rate. For\nexample in the case of a light neutrino exchange the formula is:\n\u22121\nT1/2\n= F (Q5\u03b2\u03b2 , Z)|N M E|2 hm\u03bd i2 ,\n\nwhere F is the phase space factor, N M E the nuclear matrix elements and hm\u03bd i2 the effective\nmass squared that depends on the mixing matrix parameters and neutrinos mass.\nTo distinguish between all different modes the energy spectrum is a good information but the\nangular distribution between the 2 electrons is also a very powerful tool.\n3\n\nNEMO3 detector\n\nThe NEMO3 (Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory) detector 2 is operated in the Frejus\nunderground laboratory since February 2003. The two main isotopes present in the detector in\nthe form of very thin foils (60 mg/cm2 ) are 100 Mo (6.914 kg, Q\u03b2\u03b2 = 3.034 MeV) and 82 Se (932\ng, Q\u03b2\u03b2 = 2.995 MeV). On both side of the source there is a gaseous tracking detector which\nconsists of 6180 open drift cells operating in the Geiger mode and that reconstructs particle\ntrack in three dimensions. Surrounding the tracking detector, the calorimeter, made of 1940\nplastic scintillators coupled to low background PMTs, has an energy resolution (FWHM) of\nabout 14% at 1 MeV. The detector is surrounded by a magnetic field that allows the measure\nthe particle charge signature. The whole detector is covered by two types of shielding against\nexternal \u03b3-rays and neutrons.\nThe NEMO3 detector allows the identification of electrons, positrons, alphas and gammas, that\nmakes it a unique double beta decay experiment since its a powerful tool to measure precisely\nthe background and to constraint different hypothesis for the \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay using the angular\ndistribution between the two electrons.\n4\n\nResults\n\nThe data presented here have been taken between February 2003 and September 2004 (Phase\nI) 3 . The double beta events are selected by asking two tracks with negative charge curvature\nand coming from a common vertex in the source, each track being associated to a fired PMT\nwith an energy greater than 200 keV. In order to reduce the background we also ask no isolated gamma (no isolated PMT) and no delayed track (to prevent from Bi-Po coincidence) to\nbe present.\n\n\f100Mo\n7.369 kg.y\n\n10000\n\n219,000 \u03b2\u03b2 events\n8000\n\nS/B = 40\n6000\n\nNumber of events\n\nNumber of events/0.05 MeV\n\nNEMO 3 (Phase I)\n\n12000\n\n219,000 \u03b2\u03b2 events\n8000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nE2e (MeV)\n\nS/B = 40\n\n6000\n4000\n\n0\n\n100Mo\n7.369 kg.y\n\n10000\n\n4000\n\n0\n\nNEMO 3 (Phase I)\n\n12000\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos(\u0398)\n\nFigure 1: Energy sum of the 2 electrons (a) and angular distribution (b) of the \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd for\n\n100\n\nMo.\n\nThe results for 100 Mo \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd decay are presented in Figure 1 where we can see a very clear\nsignal (S/B = 40). Both energy and angular distribution are very consistent with Monte\nCarlo. We obtained similar results for 82 Se but with less statistics. The measured halflife are T1/2 (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) = 7.11 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 0.54 (syst) \u00d7 1018 years for 100 Mo and\nT1/2 (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) = 9.6 \u00b1 0.3 (stat) \u00b1 0.54 (syst) \u00d7 1018 years for 82 Se. A maximum likelihood analysis gave the limits on the majoron emission process to be T1/2 (\u03b2\u03b2\u03c70) > 2.7 \u00d7 1022\nyears.\n4.1\n\nNeutrinoless double beta decay\n\nNEMO3 is able to measure each component of the background by different analysis channel:\nCompton electrons for external 214 Bi and 208 Tl, crossing electrons for external neutrons or\ngammas, internal (e\u2212 , \u03b3\u03b3) and (e\u2212 , \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3) for 208 Tl impurities in the source, and (e\u2212 , delayed \u03b1)\nevents for 222 Rn that is the dominant background in this set of data (25 \u00b1 5 mBq/m3 ). In\nthe \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd region, 2.8 < E1 + E2 < 3.2 MeV, the expected number of events is estimated to\nbe 1.4 events (\u223c 1 event due to radon, 0.3 from \u03b2\u03b22\u03bd and 0.1 from Tl in the foil) per year\nand kilogram. Figure 2 presents the energy spectra in the neutrinoless double beta region. No\nevidence for \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd decay has been found and the data are consistent with the Monte Carlo.\nThe Cu and Te data (no \u03b2\u03b2 decay in the selected energy region) are also analysed to study\nthe background, they show good agreement with radon measurement. The limits obtained are\nT1/2 (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) > 4.6 \u00d7 1023 years, hm\u03bd i < 0.7 \u2212 2.8 eV for 100 Mo and T1/2 (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) > 1.0 \u00d7 1023 years,\nhm\u03bd i < 0.7 \u2212 2.8 eV for 82 Se, incertainties coming from the choice in the NME.\nThe V+A hypothesis has been analysed and the limit T1/2 (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd) > 1.7 \u00d7 1023 years has been\nobtained.\nNEMO3 is still running and in December 2004, a radon-free air factory has been built which\nmade the Rn background decrease to the negligible level of 1-2 mBq / m3 . The data in the\nlow-radon period are still under analysis and will lead to more sensitive results.\n4.2\n\nExcited states\n\nThe search of double beta decay to the excited states of 100 Ru is an important study since\nit brings additional information for the calculation of NME. Despite the lower rate of these\ndecays compared to the ground state decay, this search is helped by the very clear topology\nof the signal: in addition to the usual selection cuts for double beta decay we have one (2+\n1\nstate) or two (0+\n1 state) photons in time and with fixed energy. The kinematic cuts have been\noptimized from massive Monte Carlo simulations.

Information on energy and angular\ndistributions is also obtained. Using the phase space value G = 1.64\u00d710\u221219 y \u22121 (for ga = 1.254),\nwe obtain the nuclear matric element value M (0+\n1 ) = 0.103 \u00b1 0.011, that is 20% lower than the\nvalue to the ground state M (g.s) = 0.126\u00b10.005. The search for the double beta decay to the 2+\n1\n2\u03bd (0+ \u2192 2+ ) > 1.1 \u00d7 1021 years, while the search for neutrinoless double\nstate led to the limit T1/2\n1\n0\u03bd (0+ \u2192 0+ ) > 8.9 \u00d7 1022 years and T 0\u03bd (0+ \u2192 2+ ) > 1.6 \u00d7 1023\nbeta decay gave the limit T1/2\n1\n1\n1/2\nyears.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe NEMO3 detector showed its ability to measure and understand all its background. No\nevidence for \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd has been found in the radon period and the analysis of the data taken in the\nlow-radon period is in progress and will reach better sensitivity. We improved the limits on the\nmajoron and V+A decay modes. Finally we obtained new measurements and improved limits\non the decay of the 100 Mo into excited states.\nReferences\n1. J. Suhonen and O.
