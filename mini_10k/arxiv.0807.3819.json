At the nanoscale, the ballistic approximation is usually a good starting point for thermal transport and a lot of theoretical research on ballistic thermal transport have been reported6,7,8,9 . However, the\nballistic approximation would lead to unphysical results,\nsuch as infinite phonon mean free path, divergent thermal conductivity and zero temperature gradient. In most\ncases we need to go beyond ballistic limit to include\neffects of scattering for a more realistic consideration.\nIn fact, phonon-phonon interaction is one of the significant factors for understanding and improving thermal transport properties. Since the sizes of nanostructures are comparable to phonon mean free path, thermal transport in these systems is in the intermediate region between ballistic and diffusive ranges. Nanoscale\nthermal transport has been studied through many approaches10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 . Nevertheless, no satisfactory method has been available to deal with thermal\ntransport in the intermediate region.\nOur work aims to provide an efficient way to study\nballistic-diffusive thermal transport including the effects\nof phonon-phonon interaction. Here we propose a new\nformalism of nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)\nto treat phonon-phonon interaction in momentum space\nat finite temperatures. It is known that NEGF is usu-\n\nally used to study nonequilibrium problems, but its formulism can be applied to equilibrium systems as well.\nWhile Matsubara formalism21 is conventionally used for\nequilibrium Green's function calculation at finite temperatures, NEGF is an alternative that also works for such\nsituations. In our framework of NEGF, the analytical\nform of phonon self energy to any order can be easily\nderived and phonon frequency shift and lifetime are directly related to the retarded self energy. The phonon\nfrequency shift can also be accurately predicted by an\neffective phonon theory based on the ergodic hypothesis (equipartition theorem)22,23,24 . For weak phononphonon interaction, however, frequency shift is usually\nvery small and the major influence on thermal transport\nis from the finite phonon lifetime. It will be shown that\nNEGF of lowest order is equivalent to Fermi's golden rule\nwhen considering phonon lifetime.\nWe also provide a new approach to study thermal\ntransport using NEGF. Our NEGF formalism gives\nphonon lifetime and mean free path. Using a phenomenological transmission function determined from mean free\npath in the Landauer formula, ballistic-diffusive thermal\ntransport can be studied10,25,26 . Many works have been\ndone on thermal transport by NEGF16,17,18,19,20 . In previous treatments, the system is situated at the center as\na junction with semi-infinite leads on the two sides. The\ncentral part can not be too large due to the constraint\nof computational capability. Here we compute phonon\nlifetime in a periodic system at equilibrium, and feed the\nlifetime information to phonon transmission function in\nthe Landauer formula. Our approach is computationally more efficient, but with a less rigorous treatment of\n\n\f2\ntransmission function.\nIn Sec. II, the general theory of NEGF is developed for\nphonon-phonon interaction and ballistic-diffusive thermal transport. As an application we employ the method\nto study two explicit models in Sec. III. A summary is\nmade in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL THEORY\n\nIn the harmonic approximation, a crystal can be described in terms of non-interacting phonons. The concept\nof \"phonon\" remains valid when the anharmonic contribution is small compared with the harmonic. In this case,\nthe quasi-particle approximation can be made, and then\nthe anharmonic effects give a complex shift to phonon\nfrequency27 : the real part shifts the value of frequency\nwhile the imaginary part corresponds to phonon lifetime.\nOne of the earliest methods28,29,30 of calculating\nphonon lifetime is based on Fermi's golden rule and the\nBoltzmann-Peierls equation. However, those approaches\ncan not be systematically improved. In contrast, the\nGreen's function method provides a systematic way to\nconsider phonon-phonon interaction at finite temperatures. Phonon-phonon interaction has been studied using equilibrium Green's function method27,31,32,33,34,35 .\nThese works can be roughly divided into two groups according to the decoupling schemes used. For the first\ngroup, the temperature dependent Green's function with\nMatsubara representation is employed based on a general Wick's theorem which holds when the system is large\nenough27,31,32,33 . A fictitious imaginary time is used and\nan analytical continuation is needed to get the retarded\nGreen's function36 . For the other group, a decoupling\nscheme proposed by Valle and Procacci is used34,35 . In\ndetail, in the equation of motion for the real time Green's\nfunction, thermal averages are replaced with those appropriate for the harmonic Hamiltonian. The analytical expression of phonon self energy including high order terms\ncan be easily evaluated by a computer-aided technique,\ndespite of the lack of a clear theoretical foundation.\nWe will employ the NEGF method as described in\nRef. 37. Its formalism has been generalized to treat arbitrary nonequilibrium systems with arbitrary initial density matrices by Wagner38 . If interactions are adiabatically switched on and an initial non-interacting Hamiltonian is used, Wick's theorem is still valid for the contour\nordered Green's function39 . The adiabatic switch-on assumption leads to a loss of information related to initial\ncorrelation, but is still reasonable in most physical situations. We will use this assumption and take the contour\nordered Green's function to study phonon-phonon interaction.\nIn this section, we develop the general theory of NEGF\nto deal with phonon-phonon interaction and ballisticdiffusive thermal transport. At first, a general Hamiltonian of anharmonic system is given, and the contour\nordered Green's function of phonon is defined. Then,\n\ntwo schemes are provided to solve Green's function. One\nis to use the equation of motion and recursive expansion rules. The other is to apply Feynman rules for self\nenergy and solve the Dyson equation. Within the quasiparticle approximation, the retarded self energy directly\ncorresponds to phonon lifetime. Next we will compare\nthe NEGF method with Fermi's golden rule. Finally, we\ndiscuss how to study ballistic-diffusive thermal transport\nwith the information of phonon mean free path.\nA.\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nIn a Taylor expansion of the potential energy \u03a6 at equilibrium configuration, terms higher than the second order\nconstitute anharmonic Hamiltonian:\nX 1\nX\nHA =\n\u03a6i1 i2 ***in ui1 ui2 * * * uin .

The contour runs slightly\nabove the real axis from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e, and back to \u2212\u221e\nslightly below the real axis.

Then the frequency of the quasi-phonon is \u03c9\u0303q = \u03c9q + \u2206q . The retarded phonon Green's function can be written as\nGrqq\u0304 (\u03c9) =\n\n1\n.\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 (\u03c9q + \u2206q \u2212 i\u0393q )2\n\n(24)\n\nThe Dyson equation for the retarded Green's function is\nGrqq\u0304 (\u03c9) =\n\n1\n.\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9q2 \u2212 \u03a3rq\u0304q (\u03c9)\n\n(25)\n\nThe quasi-particle approximation is valid if\n|\u2206q \u2212 i\u0393q | \u226a \u03c9q .\n\n(26)\n\nWith this condition, from Eqs.

Note that\n\u03a3r (\u2212\u03c9) = [\u03a3r (\u03c9)]\u2217 implies Re[\u03a3r (\u2212\u03c9)] = Re[\u03a3r (\u03c9)] and\nIm[\u03a3r (\u2212\u03c9)] = \u2212Im[\u03a3r (\u03c9)]. The retarded self energy of\n\"\u03c9-independent\" diagrams is real. To consider phonon\nlifetime, we only need to calculate \"\u03c9-dependent\" diagrams.\nF.\n\nThe NEGF method and Fermi's golden rule\n\nFermi's golden rule is widely used to calculate phonon\nlifetime in previous studies. What is the relation and difference between the NEGF method and Fermi's golden\nrule? This is the question to be answered in this subsection.\nLet's consider three-phonon interaction at first. The\nlowest order self energy contributed by the three-phonon\ninteraction is described by the Feymann diagram shown\nin Fig. 1(a). Use the above Feymann rules , we can write\ndown the corresponding \"lesser\" self energy as\nX Z d\u03c91 Z d\u03c92\n<\n(2i~)2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\u03a3q\u0304q (\u03c9) =\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nq q\n1 2\n\n0,<\n\u00d7 Fq\u0304q1 q2 Fqq\u03041 q\u03042 G0,<\nq1 q\u03041 (\u03c91 )Gq2 q\u03042 (\u03c92 ).\n\nThermal conductance of a system at temperature T\ncan be given by the Landauer formula as\n\u03c3=\n\n1\nL\n\nX\n\n~\u03c9q vqx\n\nq(vqx >0)\n\nThe imaginary part of retarded self energy can be obtained through the relation\n(31)\n\n\u2202f (\u03c9q )\n\u039eq ,\n\u2202T\n\n(33)\n\nwhere L is the length of system in the direction of heat\nflow (x direction here), vqx is the phonon velocity in the x\ndirection, f (\u03c9q ) is the Bose-Einstein distribution, and \u039eq\nis the transmission function of phonon mode q \u2261 (q, jq ).\nEq. (33) is valid from one-dimensional (1D) to threedimensional (3D). Thermal conductivity has the form of\n\u03ba = \u03c3L/S in 3D systems, where S is the cross section\narea. And for quasi-1D systems, we define \u03ba = \u03c3L.\nA phenomenological formula is proposed to calculate phonon transmission function from the mean free\npath10,25,26 :\n\u039eq = (1 + L/lq )\u22121\n\n(34)\n\nwith lq = vq \u03c4q .

Finally calculated re+ [f (\u03c9q1 ) \u2212 f (\u03c9q2 )][\u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03c9q1 \u2212 \u03c9q2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9q1 + \u03c9q2 )]}.\nsults and related discussion are provided.\n(32)\nX\n\nOn the other hand, we can use Fermi's golden rule to\nsolve this problem and obtain the same result of reciprocal phonon lifetime, which is presented in Ref. 40. Fermi's\ngolden rule is also equivalent to the lowest order NEGF\nfor more than three-phonon interaction. This conclusion\ncan be proved in a similar procedure as above and it will\nnot be elaborated here.\nIn summary, NEGF of lowest order is equivalent to\nFermi's golden rule but the higher order terms of NEGF\ngive additional corrections to it. The NEGF method provides a more comprehensive and systematic way than\nFermi's golden rule to treat phonon-phonon interaction.\n\nA.\n\n1D atom chain models\n\nThe 1D atom chain models have been intensively studied. One of remarkable problems is in what condition the\nthermal transport of a 1D system obeys Fourier law. The\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) \u03b2 model and the \u03c64 model are\ntwo example models which are extensively used due to\ntheir simplicity. It is found that the thermal conductivity in the FPU-beta model diverges with system size\ndue to the momentum conservation, while it is convergent in the \u03c64 model41,42,43,44 . Previous study indicates\n\n\f6\nthat the external potential plays a determinant role for\nnormal thermal conduction42,45 .\nWe will study the FPU-\u03b2 model and the \u03c64 model\nwith an additional harmonic on-site potential. In the\nfollowing, these two models are denoted as model I and\nmodel II, respectively. The Hamiltonian of model I is\n\u0015\nX \u0014 u\u03072\nK\nK0 2 \u03b2\ni\n2\n4\n+ (ui \u2212 ui+1 ) +\nu + (ui \u2212 ui+1 ) .\nH=\n2\n2\n2 i\n4\ni\n(36)\nThe Hamiltonian of model II has the form\n\u0015\nX \u0014 u\u03072\nK\nK0 2 \u03bc 4\ni\n2\nH=\n+ (ui \u2212 ui+1 ) +\nu + ui . (37)\n2\n2\n2 i\n4\ni\nThey share the same harmonic Hamiltonian:\n\u0015\nX \u0014 u\u03072\nK\nK0 2\ni\n2\nH0 =\n+ (ui \u2212 ui+1 ) +\nu .\n2\n2\n2 i\ni\n\n(38)\n\nThe dispersion relation\np of unperturbed phonon can be\nexpressed as \u03c9q = K0 + 2K(1 \u2212 cos qa). We set the\nlattice constant a = 1 \u00c5, K = 1.0 eV/(amu \u00c52 ) and\nK0 = 0.1K. These parameters are chosen to be the same\nas those in Ref. 14, where model II is studied by the\nQMD method. The group velocity is defined as vq =\n\u2202\u03c9q /\u2202q. Since a harmonic on-site potential is included\nin H0 , vq=0 = 0 and \u03c9q ranges from 0.31 \u00d7 1014 s\u22121 to\n1.99 \u00d7 1014 s\u22121 .\nFor model I, we choose \u03b2 = 1.0 eV/(amu2 \u00c54 ) and the\nNEGF method provides converged result till T = 600 K.\nFor model II, \u03bc = 1.0 eV/(amu2 \u00c54 ) is also tried , but\nthe NEGF method fails even for T = 100 K. To get a\nconverged result, we select \u03bc = 0.05 eV/(amu2 \u00c54 ) and\nthe NEGF method would still work at the temperature\nhigher than 1000 K. This is partially because a small anharmonic parameter \u03bc is chosen. The calculations indicate that the NEGF method which is based on perturbation expansion is only suitable for weak phonon-phonon\ninteractions.\nThe two models share the same set of Feynman diagrams for self energy. Since their anharmonic parts are\nboth quartic, only those vertices with four legs will appear in the Feynman diagrams. The 4-leg vertex of model\nI has the form of\n2\u03b2\n[1 \u2212 cos q2 a\n(39)\nN\n\u2212 cos q3 a \u2212 cos q4 a + cos (q2 + q3 )a + cos (q2 + q4 )a\n+ cos (q3 + q4 )a \u2212 cos (q2 + q3 + q4 )a].\n\nFq1 q2 q3 q4 = \u2206(q1 + q2 + q3 + q4 )\n\nAs qi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) approaches zero, Fq1 q2 q3 q4 goes to 0.\nThe 4-leg vertex of model II is\nFq1 q2 q3 q4\n\n\u03bc\n= \u2206(q1 + q2 + q3 + q4 ) .\nN\n\n(40)\n\nOnly \"\u03c9-dependent\" diagrams of lowest orders are considered in our calculation. These include one diagram of\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Comparison of thermal conductance\n(\u03c3) from different methods: NEGF (red solid symbols) and\nQMD (black open symbols).

Using the Feynman rules developed\nabove, the analytical form of self energy for these three\ndiagrams can be derived, and then be used in numerical calculation. As described in the previous section,\nphonon lifetime and mean free path can be obtained from\nthe imaginary part of the retarded self energy. Thermal\ntransport properties can be given by the Landauer formula.\n\nB.\n\nComparison of thermal conductance from\nNEGF and QMD\n\nBased on a generalized Langevin dynamics, the QMD\nmethod is developed to study quantum thermal transport\nin Ref. 14, where the considered system consists of a central junction part and two leads serving as heat baths.\nThis method uses quantum heat baths derived from BoseEinstein statistics and treats the central part classically.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Results of Model I.

The\ncomparison of thermal conductance with that from the\nNEGF method is presented in Fig. 2 for models I and\nII. Both methods give essentially the same results at low\ntemperatures. Deviations appear at high temperatures.\nThe NEGF method gives larger thermal conductance for\nmodel I and smaller thermal conductance for model II. It\nis not unexpected that they give quantitatively different\nresults. A quasi-classical approximation is made in the\nQMD method. The NEGF method makes perturbation\nexpansion and neglects higher order terms which become\nimportant at high temperatures. Both methods provide\nonly approximate results, and it is still unclear which\nmethod is superior. More work is needed to understand\nthese differences.\n\nC.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nThe results of model I and model II are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively. The modedependent phonon lifetime at different temperatures and\nthe temperature-dependent thermal conductivity with\ndifferent system sizes are shown .\nThe two models with different types of anharmonic\npotentials give distinct properties of phonon lifetime.\nFor model I, the translational invariant quartic potential leads to zero retarded self energy and infinite phonon\nlifetime for infinite long wavelength mode, which is not\nshown in Fig. 3(a). Long wavelength phonon mode has\nlong lifetime. In contrast, the long wavelength phonon of\nmodel II, which experiences large scattering due to the\nexistence of quartic on-site potential, has short lifetime.\nIncreasing temperature has two effects on thermal conductivity: shorter phonon mean free path and more\nphonon excitation. The first effect decreases and the\nsecond effect increases thermal conductivity.

At high temperatures, for a system whose length\nis comparable to the phonon mean free path, the excitation of phonon modes becomes less important to thermal transport and then thermal conductivity would decrease with increasing temperature due to the shortening\nof phonon mean free path. These are verified in Fig. 3(b)\nand Fig. 4(b). For very large system at low temperatures,\nthe thermal conductivity of model I decreases as the temperature increases, which is different from that of model\nII. This may be explained by the fact that the temperature has larger influence on the phonon mean free path\nin model I than in model II at low temperatures.\nOne of the advantages of our method is that once\nthe mode-dependent phonon mean free path is obtained,\nthermal conductivity of different system sizes can be obtained easily. It would be interesting to show the sizedependent behavior of thermal conductivity, which is\npresented in Fig. 5. When the system length is much\nsmaller than the phonon mean free path (i.e., the ballistic regime) thermal conductance does not change with\nsystem size, and thermal conductivity increases linearly\nwith the system size. When the system length increases\nto much larger than the phonon mean free path (of order of 106 \u00c5 in model II at 100 K) (i.e., the diffusive\nregime), thermal conductivity will cease to change with\nsystem size. A ballistic-diffusive transition with increasing system size is shown in Fig. 5 clearly.\nThe FPU-\u03b2 model, model I with K0 = 0, has been\nwidely known to have divergent thermal conductivity.\nWith an additional harmonic on-site potential, we get\na finite bulk-limit thermal conductivity for model I as\nshown in Fig. 5. How does a nonzero K0 , the harmonic\non-site potential, induce different behavior of thermal\nconductivity? An analysis on long wavelength phonon\nmodes will answer this question. As q approaches zero,\n\nFqqi qj qk \u221d q and \u03a3rq\u0304q (\u03c9q ) \u221d q 2 . When K0 = 0, \u03c9q \u221d q,\nvq \u2192 constant, \u03c4q \u221d q \u22121 and lq \u221d q \u22121 . Thermal conductivity contributed by long wavelength phonon modes\nwould diverge with increasing system size. When K0 6= 0,\n\u03c9q \u2192 constant, vq \u221d q, \u03c4q \u221d q \u22122 and lq \u221d q \u22121 . The\nquadratic on-site potential breaks translational invariance and the phonon modes with very long wavelength\nhave nearly zero group velocity. Though those phonon\nmodes has nearly infinite mean free path, it can be shown\nanalytically that the thermal conductivity contributed\nby them does not diverge with increasing system size for\nK0 6= 0. Other phonon modes which have finite mean\nfree paths also contribute a finite thermal conductivity.\nSo finite thermal conductivity is obtained in bulk limit\nfor model I.\nComparing the results of the two models may give some\ninformation on how an anharmonic on-site potential influences thermal transport. A quartic on-site potential\nis included in model II. The anharmonic parameter \u03bc of\nmodel II is 20 times as small as that of model I. However, model II gives much shorter phonon lifetime for low\nfrequency modes, which are very important for thermal\ntransport especially at low temperatures. As shown in\nFig. 5, the bulk-limit thermal conductivity of model II is\nmuch smaller than that of model I at 100 K. The comparison indicates that even a small quartic on-site potential\ncan largely decrease the phonon lifetimes of long wavelength modes and significantly affect thermal transport\nespecially at low temperatures. Our results confirm that\nthe external potential plays a determinant role in thermal\ntransport.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have provided a new approach to study phononphonon interaction and ballistic-diffusive thermal transport by the NEGF method and the Landauer formula.\nA new formalism of NEGF has been developed to systematically study phonon-phonon interaction in momentum space at finite temperatures in equilibrium. Using a\nphenomenological transmission function, which can be\nobtained from the mode-dependent phonon mean free\npath given by the NEGF formalism, the Landauer formula predicts thermal transport properties from ballistic\nregion to diffusive region. Our approach is efficient for investigating ballistic-diffusive thermal transport in weak\ninteraction situations, where little additional computational effort is needed when the system size changes. As\nan application, we have investigated two 1D atom chain\nmodels. The results obtained are qualitatively agree with\nthose by the QMD method. It is found that an additional\nharmonic on-site potential in the FPU-\u03b2 model could remove the divergence of thermal conductivity and a small\nquartic on-site potential can largely reduce the phonon\nlifetimes of long wavelength modes. The results confirm\nthat the external potential plays an important role in\nthermal transport42,45 .\n\n\f9\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Gang Zhang, Jingtao L\u00fc,\nLifa Zhang and Xiang Wu for discussions.
