Beyond its fundamental significance, the understanding and the possible control of this\ndynamics in various scenarios is a key element for mastering quantum information processing. Here\nwe report the quantitative probing of what can be called the quantum decoherence of detectors, a\nprocess reminiscent of the decoherence of quantum states in the presence of coupling with a reservoir. We demonstrate how the quantum features of two single-photon counters vanish under the\ninfluence of a noisy environment. We thereby experimentally witness the transition between the\nfull-quantum operation of the measurement device to the \"semi-classical regime\", described by a\npositive Wigner function. The exact border between these two regimes is explicitely determined\nand measured experimentally.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 42.50.Dv, 03.65.Ta\n\nThe coupling of quantum systems to an environment\nleads to the transition from the quantum to the classical\nworlds. The study of this transition has raised a great\ndeal of work over the past decade [1, 2]. For example,\nseminal experiments have allowed the controlled probing\nof the decoherence of quantum states, including mesoscopic superpositions in microwave cavity [3, 4], motional\nstates of a trapped ion [5], spatially separated atomic superpositions [6], and amplified number states [7]. If decoherence lays at the heart of the foundations of quantum\nphysics, this process is also of pratical importance as it\nplays a central role in quantum information processing\n[8]. In the present work, we complement this study by\nadressing the effect of a decohering environment, not on\na quantum state, but on the quantum capability of a\nmeasurement apparatus.\nWe consider here how a noisy environment quantitatively degrades the quantum performances of optical detectors. This corresponds to many pratical situations\nwhere dark counts, additional background or any undesired emissions into the detected mode can degrade\nthe expected performances of the measurement, which\ntherefore limit their use in a large range of applications. Precisely assessing the quantum features of photon counting devices plays indeed an increasing role in\nthe development of quantum technologies [9]. For example, measurement-driven information processing [10, 11],\nquantum key distribution [12] and state engineering [13\u2013\n18] rely more and more on such countings. The control\nof the non-classical features of the detectors used in these\nprotocols is central to this endeavour.\nIn order to follow the decoherence of detectors exposed\nto a controlled noisy environment, we experimentally determine their positive operator valued measure (POVM)\n{\u03a0\u0302n } [19\u201321] and assess their non-classical features. For\nphase-insensitive measurements, as it is the case for the\nsingle-photon detectors considered here, the outcome labelled by 'n' corresponds to 'n clicks'. In the ideal case\n\nof photon counters with unity quantum efficiency, photon number resolution and no dark counts, the POVM\noperator associated to the measurement 'n' is the projector |nihn| in the number basis. Real devices differ from\nthis case and the operator \u03a0\u0302n can be written as a sum of\nprojectors:\n\u03a0\u0302n =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nrl,n (\u03b7, \u03bd)|lihl|.\n\n(1)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere the coefficients rl,n \u2265 0 depend on the detector\nquantum efficiency \u03b7 and the mean number \u03bd of noise\ncounts in the detection windows. Detector tomography\nleads to the experimental determination of all the coefficients {rl,n (\u03b7, \u03bd)} without any a priori knowledge on the\ndevice [22, 23]. The reconstructed operator can then be\nrepresented by a quasi-probability distribution, namely\nits Wigner function. This distribution can take negative\nvalues, which prevents it to be interpreted as a regular\nprobability distribution. The existence of such negative\nvalues is therefore a strong signature of the full quantum character of the measurement device under study.\nIn addition, it can be shown that the non-classical properties of a measurement performed by a detector can be\nassociated with the non-classical properties of the state\nretrodicted from its response [24]. The density matrix of\nthe retrodicted state is given by the normalized POVM.\nThe negativity of the detector Wigner function can thus\nbe associated with the negativity of its retrodicted state.\nOur work was carried out on two different detectors,\na single-photon counting module based on an avalanche\nphotodiode and a two-channel time-multiplexed detector\nwith photon-number resolution ability [25]. We determine the Wigner functions associated with the two dectectors under study and consider in particular their negativity at the origin of coordinates for different amounts\nof added noise. In analogy with decoherence studies performed on quantum states, we will be able to precisely\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (color online). Experimental setup. (a) The \"black-box\" detector is probed with coherent pulses of well calibrated\namplitudes coupled into a single-mode fiber. The polarizing beam-splitter (PBS) provides a first attenuation and a small\nratio of the beam is then tapped and measured with a powermeter. A set of neutral density filters (ND) gives a subsequent\nstrong attenuation (\u2243 107 ) to reach the regime of few photons per pulse. In order to investigate the effect induced by a noisy\nenvironment, different background noise levels are simulated via a continuous-wave laser mixed with the probe pulses on a\n50/50 fiber beam-splitter. Two devices are characterized: (b) a conventional single-photon counting module (APD) providing\nan on-off outcome and (c) a single-loop time-multiplexed detector (TMD) with photon-number resolution ability. The 3d-plots\ncorrespond to the experimental Wigner function associated with the one-click outcome for each device without added noise.\n\nwitness the transition of a detector from the full quantum\nto the semi-classical domain, where quantum fluctuations\ncan be seen as arising from unmastered fluctuations of\nthe electromagnetic field. We will finally illustrate how\nthe detector decoherence manifests itself when the detector is used to herald the preparation of a target state, a\nparadigm for quantum state engineering.\nFigure 1a shows a schematic of the experimental setup.\nDetectors are probed with a tomographically complete\nset of coherent states |\u03b1i of different amplitudes obtained\nfrom a pulsed laser source at 795 nm with a repetition\nrate set to 1.187\u00b10.001 MHz (Mira900 with Pulse Picker\n9200, Coherent). The average photon number per pulse\ncan be varied from 0 to 100, with residual laser intensity fluctuations between subsequent pulses measured to\nbe 5% (peak to peak).The two detectors under study\nare contained in the black box of Fig. 1a, with details\nin insets 1b and 1c. The first device is an avalanche\nphotodiode (APD, Perkin Elmer SPCM-AQR-13), which\ncorresponds to an \"on/off detector\" as it provides only\ntwo possible outcomes corresponding to one-click and noclick. This binary response can only distinguish between\nzero photons and \"one or more\". The second detector is\nhome-made and designed following the time-multiplexed\ndetection (TMD) scheme of Ref. [25] consisting in splitting the light in two different time bins and detecting\nit with an APD. This single-loop TMD realizes a simple version of a photon-number resolving detector as it\nprovides three possible responses: no-click, one-click and\n\ntwo-clicks. In the ideal case, a single photon will provide\none-click while two impinging photons have 50% probability to fill both time bins and thus leading to a twoclicks outcome. In order to directly compare the two\ndevices, their total quantum efficiencies have been both\nset to 0.28 \u00b1 0.02. This value takes into account all the\nlosses and the intrinsic quantum efficiency of the APD.\nThe coupling into the fiber before the black-box is part\nof the probe calibration and does not contribute to this\nefficiency. The detection window is set to 40 ns long.\nFor both detectors, we collect the tomographic data\nconsisting of the different outcome statistics as a function of the average photon number per pulse. The POVM\ndensity matrices are then reconstructed by a Maximumlikelihood algorithm [20] and the associated Wigner functions are finally obtained by the sum of the Wigner functions of projectors |nihn|, each weighted by the coefficients rl,n (\u03b7, \u03bd) [26]. As shown in Fig. 1b and 1c, the\ndifference between the two detectors can be clearly seen\non the general shape of their associated Wigner function.\nAs we will see more precisely later, the value at the origin\nis negative for both detectors, which is a signature of the\nfull quantum character of the measurement. Our work\naims at following the evolution of this negativity under\nthe influence of noise.\nExperimentally, we investigate such an effect by adding\nan additional excitation channel. As sketched on Fig.\n1a, the background noise is controlled by injecting in the\nsame path than the probe light a continuous-wave coher-\n\n\f3\n\nwhile for \u03a0\u03021 it can be read as:\n\nW1 (0, 0) =\n\n4 \u2212\u03bd\ne\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u03bd/2\n1\n\u2212\n2 \u2212 \u03b7/2 2 \u2212 \u03b7\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nGiven a quantum efficiency \u03b7, the negativity disappears\n\u03b7\nfor \u03bd = \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 \u03b7/2) for the APD and \u22122 ln(1 \u2212 4\u2212\u03b7\n)\nfor the TMD. In both cases, for the quantum efficiency\nconsidered here, these values can be approximated by the\nsimple formula \u03bd \u223c \u03b7/2, as experimentally shown.\nBesides its fundamental interest in understanding the\nquantum properties of optical detectors, our investiga-\n\na)\n\nWon (0,0)\n\nWon (x,0)\n\n0.30\n0.20\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n\nn=0.00\nn=0.03\nn=0.08\nn=0.18\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.08\nn\n\n0.16\n\n0.00\n\n0.08\nn\n\n0.16\n\n0.00\n\nb)\n\n0.00\nW1(0,0)\n\n0.15\n\nW1(x,0)\n\nent beam at 1064 nm (Diabolo, Innolight). By adjusting\nthe cw laser power, we simulate different noise levels with\nPoissonian statistics. This statistics is of particular interest as it simulates many practical cases for single-photon\ncounters. Four different values are used for the mean\nnumber of dark counts \u03bd = {0, 0.03, 0.08, 0.18}. The\nWigner functions for the one-click POVM, Won for the\nAPD and W1 for the TMD, are displayed in Fig. 2. Due\nto the absence of phase dependence, only cross-sections\nare given.\nWhen the noise increases, the negativity of the Wigner\nfunctions is gradually reduced, and finally disappears.\nThe insets of Fig. 2 provide the evolutions of the negativity at the origin as functions of the added noise.\nThe observed transition from negative to positive Wigner\nfunctions witnesses here in a quantitative way the degradation of detector performances with a noisy environment. Moreover, we experimentally identify the exact\nborder between two different regimes for the detectors\nunder study as \u03bd \u223c \u03b7/2. The lower is the efficiency of\nthe counter, the more stringent is the limit on the noise\nlevel.\nThese results are in agreement with the theoretical\nmodel that we outline now. For phase-insensitive detectors, the effect of Poissonian dark counts can be included\nin the theoretical description of POVM operators [27].\nThe detector not being able to discriminate between dark\ncounts and photoelectrons, the probability for registering\n'n' clicks, i.e. the expectation value of \u03a0\u0302n , is indeed the\ndiscrete convolution of the dark count probability distribution, given by \u03bd n e\u2212\u03bd /n!, and the probability of 'n'\nclicks in the absence of noise (\u03bd=0). By including the\nnoise into the model of Ref. [28], we derived the coefficients rl,of f (\u03b7, \u03bd) = e\u2212\u03bd (1 \u2212 \u03b7)l for \u03a0of f of the APD\nand\n\u03b7\n)l ) for \u03a01\nrl,1 (\u03b7, \u03bd) = 2e\u2212\u03bd/2 (1\u2212\u03b7)l (\u2212e\u2212\u03bd/2 +(1+ 2(1\u2212\u03b7)\nof the TMD detector. The probabilities for the photon to\nbe sent toward the long and the short path of the TMD\nwere assumed to be equal.

The cross-sections of the Wigner function associated to the one-click response are displayed for (a) the APD\nand (b) the TMD for different values of added-noise given by\nthe mean number \u03bd of dark counts in the detection window.\nInsets give the evolution of the negativity at the origin and\ndotted lines correspond to theoretical predictions. Error bars\nare obtained by combining the following uncertainties. The\nnumerical determination of rl,n (\u03b7, \u03bd) critically depends on the\nnumber L of projectors taken in the development of Eq. 1. To\nevaluate the uncertainty due to this truncation, the ML algorithm has been run for different values of L. Another error\nsource is the uncertainty on the average photon number of the\nprobe states. This contribution has been checked by replacing each experimental |\u03b1j |2 with a random value sorted by a\nGaussian distribution centered over |\u03b1j |2 and with a variance\n0.025|\u03b1j |2 corresponding to the 5% intensity fluctuations, and\nby performing different tomographic runs.\n\ntion has a direct impact on the design of quantum information protocols and more precisely on the engineering\nof the quantum states of travelling optical fields using a\nconditional measurement. A general preparation strategy consists indeed in measuring one mode of an entangled state, which results in projecting the other mode\naccording to this measurement [29].\nGiven the Wigner function of the bipartite ressource\nWab , the one of the conditional state \u03c1\u0302c obtained when\nthe measurement performed on mode a leads to the outcome 'n' can be written in the most general way as:\nR\ndx\u2032 dy \u2032 Wab (x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) Wn (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )\nWc (x, y) = R\ndxdydx\u2032 dy \u2032 Wab (x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) Wn (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )\n(2)\nwhere Wn is the Wigner function associated to the\nPOVM \u03a0\u0302n and the denominator is a normalization constant. From this expression, it follows that the preparation of a quantum state with negative Wigner function\ndoes require a heralding detector with negative Wigner\nfunction if the entangled ressource has a positive one.\n\n\f4\nour study also has practical implications as it directly\napplies to quantum state preparation, as illustrated, or\nmore generally to any measurement-driven processes.\n\nWc (x,0)\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\nl=0.6\nn=0.00\nn=0.03\nn=0.08\nn=0.18\n\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nx\nFIG. 3: (color online).

Given the experimental POVM of the APD, we determine the state prepared in a conditional scheme by simulating the entangled\nressource. The plot gives the cross-sections of the Wigner\nfunction, Wc (x, 0), of the engineered state \u03c1\u0302c for \u03bb = 0.6 and\nfor the different levels of noise for which the POVM has been\npreviously reconstructed.\n\nThe decoherence of the optical detector used in the conditional measurement will thus translate into the decoherence of the prepared state.\nWe illustrate this effect by considering as a ressource\nthe correlated photon-pairs produced by two-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion [13]. Usually, this\nstate is parametrized by a coefficient \u03bb, which varies between 0 and 1 and is experimentally related to the intensity gain in the down-conversion process by the relation\n\u03bb2 = 1 \u2212 1/G. Let us note that, in the limit of high\ngain (\u03bb \u2192 1), which corresponds to vanishing widths of\nthe two-mode Gaussian Wigner function Wab , the prepared state reduces to the normalized POVM: its quantum properties are the ones of the detector.\nFigure 3 gives the theoretical Wigner function of the\nstate obtained for a heralding measurement performed\nwith the APD previously characterized on a numerically\nsimulated entangled ressource defined by \u03bb = 0.6, a typical experimental value. As it can be seen, the quantum\ndecoherence transition of the detector directly translates\ninto such transition for the engineered state. As a result,\nwe observe a gradual transition between a state with negative Wigner function to a state with a positive Wigner\nfunction approaching a gaussian shape and corresponding\nto the classical thermal state generated by spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion.\nIn conclusion, we have adressed the quantum decoherence of optical measurement devices by explicitly following this process for single-photon counters. Our investigation has thereby provided a quantitative witness of\nthe evolution of the behavior of a detector under external parameters which drive the device away from the full\nquantum regime. For the typical single-photon counters\nused here, the border is given by \u03bd \u223c \u03b7/2, as experimentally measured.
