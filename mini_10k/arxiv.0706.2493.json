The idea is\nto truncate this spectrum and subsequently to deform the product on the truncated set of\ncorresponding eigenfunctions in order to arrive at a closed algebra of functions. The most\nimportant example of a fuzzy space is certainly the fuzzy sphere, obtained by truncating\nthe set of spherical harmonics Ylm to the subset l \u2264 L together with the deformation of the\nproduct given by\nxi \u22c6 xj \u2212 xj \u22c6 xi = [xi \u22c6, xj ] \u223c i\u03b5ijk xk ,\n(1.1)\n\nwhere xi , i = 1, . . . , 3 are coordinates denoting a point on S 2 \u2282 R3 . This deformation can\nbe traced back, at least, to Berezin [1]; the geometrical interpretation is essentially due to\nMadore [2]. For a comprehensive review of fuzzy geometry, see [3].\nThe concrete physical motivation for studying fuzzy geometry is twofold: First, fuzzy\nspaces arise \u2013 similarly to other noncommutative spaces \u2013 in string theory rather naturally,\nwhen certain background fields are turned on [4]. Second, field theories on fuzzy spaces\nreduce in general to finite-dimensional matrix models and there are well-defined limits in\nwhich the classical field theories on the fuzzy sphere tend to the continuum field theories on\nthe sphere and on both the commutative and the noncommutative plane. Therefore, fuzzy\ngeometry might provide a powerful regularization scheme for quantum field theories, which\nwould possibly have several advantages over a lattice regularization.\nA serious obstacle to using fuzzy geometry as a regulator is the fact that the taking of the\nlimits which yield the commutative spaces does not commute with quantization: In [5], it was\nfound that a finite \"noncommutative anomaly\" survives the limit from the fuzzy sphere to\nthe commutative sphere. This anomaly in turn yields the well-known UV/IR mixing on the\nnoncommutative plane [6] in a certain limit. An approximate analysis of the phase diagram\nof fuzzy scalar field theory [7] as well as corresponding numerical studies [8] confirm this\npoint. However, modifications of the na\u0131\u0308ve action used for quantization on the fuzzy sphere\nmight reproduce the correct commutative limit [9].\nTo improve our understanding of the situation and to study the effects of the proposed\nmodifications, an analytical handle on the model would be desirable. As mentioned above,\nfield theories on fuzzy spaces are matrix models, and for these models, a large set of techniques has been developed over the last decades, which allows one, for example, to evaluate\nthe partition function of certain matrix models exactly. Furthermore, gauge theory on the\nfuzzy sphere has recently been solved analytically by using localization techniques on a reformulation of the theory [10]. Unfortunately, scalar field theory turns out to be too complicated\nto allow for a complete treatment.\nUsing the symmetry of the path integral measure, we can however show that the partition\nfunction of fuzzy scalar field theory is the same as that of a multitrace hermitian matrix\nmodel. Knowing this model explicitly would be very useful, as such a multitrace matrix\nmodel can be solved using e.g. the saddle-point approximation. As it turns out, a perturbative\nexpansion of the kinetic term allows us to identify the multitraces appearing in the rewritten\naction order by order in a straightforward (but increasingly tedious) way. It is clear that\nsuch an expansion makes sense in a particular region of the parameter space of the theory.\n1\n\n\fFurthermore, this expansion corresponds to the high temperature (or hopping parameter)\nexpansion which has been successfully used in the calculation of the phase diagram of scalar\nfield theory on a two-dimensional lattice; for details, see [11] and references therein.\nIn this paper, we develop the details of our technique and evaluate the perturbative\nexpansion up to second order together with the solution of the thus obtained multitrace\nmatrix model. Explicitly, we find the effective action\nSeff = \u03be2\n\n\u00112\n\u0010X\nX\nX\nX\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )4 +\nV (\u03bbi ) ,\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2 + \u03be4\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2 + \u03be(2,2)\ni>j\n\ni>j\n\ni>j\n\n(1.2)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of the matrices encoding the real fields on the fuzzy sphere;\nthe exact values of the coefficients \u03be2 , \u03be(2,2) and \u03be4 can be read off from equations (3.9) and\n(3.25). The large N behavior of the coefficients is given in (4.4) and reads as\n\u03be2 \u223c\n\nN\n,\n2\n\n\u03be2,2 = 0\n\nand \u03be4 \u223c\n\nN2\n.\n4\n\n(1.3)\n\nMoreover, we apply the same technique to the proposed modification of fuzzy scalar field\ntheory mentioned above, and compare the results to the ones from the undeformed model.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. We start with the construction of the model, comments on various special cases and symmetry considerations in section 2, before we present\nthe actual perturbative expansion in section 3. The solution of the obtained multitrace matrix model in the large N limit is presented in section 4. In section 5, we consider the modified\nfuzzy scalar field theory and its corresponding multitrace matrix model, and we conclude in\nsection 6. Our Lie algebra conventions, further useful formulae and some group theoretical\nbackground is found in the appendix.\nScalar \u03c64 -theory on the fuzzy sphere\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe fuzzy sphere\n\n\u223c CP 1 together with the Laplace operator obtained from the FubiniConsider the sphere S 2 =\nStudy metric. Its eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics Ylm with eigenvalues l(l +1) and\ndegeneracy 2l + 1. The quantized version of this space, which is known as the fuzzy sphere,\nis obtained by truncating the spectrum at a certain value L and deforming the product such\nthat it closes on the corresponding truncated set of eigenfunctions. This yields a finitedimensional algebra, which approximates the algebra of functions on S 2 . To be more precise,\nnote that in complex coordinates, all the Ylm with l \u2264 L can be written as homogeneous\npolynomials of degree L in both the homogeneous coordinates z\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, 2, on CP 1 and their\ncomplex conjugates z\u0304\u03b1 . As a basis for these polynomials, we choose the monomials\nz\u03b11 . . . z\u03b1L z\u0304\u03b21 . . . z\u0304\u03b2L .\n\n(2.1)\n\nA suitable quantization of this basis is given by1\n\u2228\n,\n\u00e2\u2020\u03b11 . . . \u00e2\u2020\u03b1L |0ih0|\u00e2\u03b21 . . . \u00e2\u03b2L \u2208 HL \u2297 HL\n1\n\nThis particular representation of functions on the fuzzy sphere can be found in [12].\n\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere |0i is the vacuum in the Fock space F of two harmonic oscillators with raising and\nlowering operators satisfying [\u00e2\u03b1 , \u00e2\u2020\u03b2 ] = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . Evidently, HL \u2282 F denotes the Hilbert space\n\u2228 is its dual. The operators (2.2) take over the r\u00f4le of the spherical\nwith L excitations and HL\nharmonics (2.1) and form by construction a closed algebra. They are furthermore in a oneto-one correspondence with endomorphisms of sections of the line bundle O(1)\u2297L \u223c\n= O(L)\nover CP 1 , and thus our quantization prescription is indeed the usual geometric quantization\nof CP 1 .\nNote that the operators (2.2) act on the N = L+1-dimensional irreducible representation\nof SU(2) and they can thus be translated into N \u00d7 N matrices which become hermitian, if we\nconsider operators corresponding to real functions. Thus, scalar field theories on the fuzzy\nsphere can be written in the form of hermitian matrix models.\nFurthermore, it can be shown that the Laplace operator \u2206 obtained from the Fubini-Study\nmetric which is equivalent to Li Li with Li = i\u03b5ijk xj \u2202k , where xi are Cartesian coordinates\ndenoting points on S 2 \u2282 R3 , turns into the second Casimir \u01082 in the representation obtained\nfrom the quantization procedure.\nDemanding invariance under the isometry group SU(2) suggests that after quantization,\nthe integral over the sphere turns into a trace over the integrand. The appropriate normalR\nization is given by the condition that S 2 dA = 4\u03c0R2 . Therefore,\nZ\n\nS2\n\n4\u03c0R2\ntr (f\u02c6) .\nN\n\ndA f \u2192\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn the following, we will omit the hats over operators for convenience.\nAltogether, the fuzzy sphere is defined in terms of a matrix algebra approximating the\nalgebra of functions on the commutative sphere and it is characterized by the parameters N\nand R. We will consider various limits of this matrix algebra in section 5.1.\n2.2.\n\nThe model\n\nWith the prescriptions of the last section, we can directly translate ordinary scalar \u03c64 -theory\non the sphere to the fuzzy picture.

We will therefore put R = 1 in most of\nour subsequent discussion.\n2.3.\n\nThe case a = 0: Hermitian matrix model\n\nIf we put a = 0 in (2.4), our model reduces to the well-known hermitian matrix model.\nThis model is exactly solvable [15]. Not only can one straightforwardly reduce this model\nto a model of eigenvalues, thereby reducing N 2 integrations to N , but one can even give an\nexplicit expression for the partition function in terms of orthogonal polynomials.\nUsing the decomposition \u03a6 = \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 , the dependence on \u03a9 drops out and the model turns\ninto\nZ\nZ Y\nN\nP 2\nP 4\nd\u03bbi \u22062 (\u039b) d\u03bcH (\u03a9) e\u2212\u03b2\u03b3 tr (r i \u03bbi +g i \u03bbi )\nZa=0 =\ni=1\n\n=\n\nZ Y\nN\n\n(2.10)\n\nd\u03bbi e\u22122\n\nP\n\ni>j\n\nln |\u03bbi \u2212\u03bbj |\u2212\u03b2\u03b3 (r\n\nP\n\n2\ni \u03bbi +g\n\nP\n\n4\ni \u03bbi\n\n),\n\ni=1\n\nwhich is the description of a one-dimensional gas of eigenvalues in a quartic potential with a\ntwo-body repulsion.

At this curve, the double well potential becomes sufficiently deep,\nso that the eigenvalue distribution splits into two components. This phase transition will be\nexpected to appear also for a 6= 0, as argued in [7].\n4\n\n\f2.4.\n\nThe case a 6= 0: The full fuzzy field theory\n\nWith a 6= 0, our model (2.4) becomes considerably more difficult than the hermitian matrix\nmodel, as the \"external matrices\" Li do not commute with unitary matrices, and thus prevent\nus from performing the integration over the angular degrees of freedom encoded in \u03a9.\nIn [16], the partition function for the hermitian matrix model with an additional external\nmatrix A and the interaction term V (A\u03a6) has been calculated exactly by counting graphs;\nthis solution was reproduced in [17] using the character expansion method. Unfortunately,\nhaving three external matrices Li as in our model (2.4) renders this method essentially useless.\nHowever, one can make the following statements: The kinetic term does not depend on\nR\ntr (\u03a6) since C2 1 = 0. Therefore, when d\u03bcH (\u03a9)f ( tr (\u03a6C2 \u03a6)) is rewritten as a function\nof the eigenvalues of \u03a6, it only depends on the differences (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj ). Since there has to\nbe a permutation symmetry between the different eigenvalues as well as invariance under\n\u03bbi \u2192 \u2212\u03bbi , the kinetic term is in fact a function of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ\nX\n1\nk \uf8f8\nd\u03bcH (\u03a9)e\u2212 tr (\u03a6C2 \u03a6) = exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\u03be(m1 ,n1 )...(mk ,nk ) \u039en2m\n. . . \u039en2m\n, (2.14)\n1\nk\nk,m1 ,n1 ,...,mk ,nk\n\nwhere\n\u039en2m :=\n\n\u039e2m\n\n\u0001n\n\n\u0011n\n\u0010X\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2m .\n\n:=\n\n(2.15)\n\ni>j\n\nBesides yielding a nice consistency check for our calculations later on, this form offers a\nphysical interpretation: The kinetic term corresponds to an additional attractive2 force between the eigenvalues, which will compete against the repulsive force stemming from the\nVandermonde determinant.\nAltogether, we can make the following qualitative predictions: We expect three different\nphases, each characterized by the dominance of one of the parameters a, r and g.\nFirst, there clearly has to be a remnant of the disordered phase of the matrix model\nwith a = 0, in which g is dominant. In this phase, h| tr (\u03a6)|i is small due to the eigenvalue\nrepulsion. As the eigenvalues are confined in a single well potential around the origin, also\nh tr (\u03a62 )i is small.\nSecond, there can be a non-uniform order phase, in which r strongly influences the shape\nof the potential and the double well becomes sufficiently deep. Here, h| tr (\u03a6)|i is still small,\nbut h tr (\u03a62 )i becomes considerably larger.\nThird, there should be a uniform ordered phase, in which the kinetic term plays a significant r\u00f4le. As the force introduced by this term corresponds to a potential which vanishes for\n\u03a6 \u223c \u03c40 , we expect that in the large N limit, the expectation value of h| tr (\u03a6)|i2 \u2248 h tr (\u03a6)2 i.\nSurprisingly, such a phase seems to be present even in the absence of the kinetic term [18].\n2.5.\n\nFrom fuzzy scalar \u03c64 -theory to multitrace matrix models\n\nIt is easy to see that any hermitian matrix model can be rewritten in terms of multitrace\nexpressions: Since the Dyson measure is invariant under the adjoint action by an arbitrary\n2\n\nThe force cannot be repulsive, as the scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere with g = 0 and r > 0 is\nevidently stable for finite N ; it can, however, be repulsive on short distances.\n\n5\n\n\funitary matrix \u03a9,\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) = d\u03bcD (\u03a9\u03a6\u03a9\u2020 ) ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nthe part of the action relevant to integration has to be invariant under this action, as well.\nFormally, we can write:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u2020\n\u2212S\n\u2212Seff\n\u2212Seff [\u03a6]\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) e\n=\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) e\nwith e\n=\nd\u03bcH (\u03a9) e\u2212S[\u03a9\u03a6\u03a9 ] ,\nvol(U(N ))\nand Seff is clearly invariant under \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a9\u03a6\u03a9\u2020 . Now the only functions of \u03a6 invariant under\nthis transformation are products of traces, and we thus have\nX\nX\nX\nSeff =\nsn tr (\u03a6n ) +\nsnm tr (\u03a6n ) tr (\u03a6m ) +\nsnmk tr (\u03a6n ) tr (\u03a6m ) tr (\u03a6k ) + . . . .\nn\n\nn,m\n\nn,m,k\n\nSuch an action is certainly much easier to study than the original one involving an external\nmatrix. Our goal will therefore be to turn our model of fuzzy scalar \u03c64 -theory at least\napproximately into such a multitrace matrix model.\nMultitrace matrix models became popular at the beginning of the 1990ies, as they were\nfound to arise naturally when higher order curvature terms were included in matrix models describing two-dimensional gravity [19], see also [20]. Including these curvature terms\namounts to modifying the kinetic term of the matrix model by adding tr (A\u03a6A\u03a6), where A\nis a fixed external matrix. Before this model was solved exactly in [16], the authors of [19]\napproximated it by the simplest multitrace matrix model of the form\nS = a tr (\u03a62 ) tr (\u03a62 ) + r tr (\u03a62 ) + g tr (\u03a64 ) .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThis matrix model has been considered as a model for string theories with c > 1 and adR\n\u221a\nditional curvature terms like d2 \u03c3 gR2 . It was found that the phase diagrams of both\ntheories share many features [20].\n2.6.\n\nThe most general hermitian matrix model\n\nAs a remark, note that one can push the analysis of the structure of hermitian matrix models\nusing the symmetries of the measure even further. The full symmetry group of the Dyson\nmeasure d\u03bcD (\u03a6) on the ensemble of N \u00d7 N hermitian matrices is in fact SO(N 2 ), as\n2\n\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) f (\u03a6) \u223c dN \u03a6\u03bc f (\u03a6\u03bc \u03c4\u03bc ) .\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere dN \u03a6\u03bc is the ordinary volume element on RN . This implies that the only relevant\npart of the action S is the one which is invariant under SO(N 2 ) rotations of the components\n\u03a6\u03bc , Seff , and therefore, the action has to be a function of tr (\u03a62 ):\nZ\nZ\nX\n\u0001n\n\u2212S\n(2.19)\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) e\n=\nd\u03bcD (\u03a6) e\u2212Seff with Seff =\ns\u0303n tr (\u03a62 ) .\n2\n\n2\n\nn\n\nIn this expansion, however, the large N limit becomes entangled with the rewriting of the\nmodel in terms of tr (\u03a62 ), which renders the reformulation useless for most purposes.\n\n6\n\n\f2.7.\n\nThe toy model: Hermitian 2 \u00d7 2 matrices\n\nFor simplicity, let us consider for a moment the case L = 1. The matrices \u03a6 act here in the\nfundamental representation of SU(2), i.e. \u03a6 is a hermitian 2\u00d72 matrix. We expand \u03a6 = \u03a6\u03bc \u03c4\u03bc\nin the generators \u03c4\u03bc = (\u03c40 , \u03c4a ) of SU(2); see appendix C for more details on our conventions.\n\u221a\nTogether with the commutation relations [\u03c4a , \u03c4b ] = 2i\u03b5abc \u03c4c , the action (2.4) simplifies to\n\u0001\nS = \u03b3 2a\u03a6a \u03a6a + r\u03a6\u03bc \u03a6\u03bc + g tr ((\u03a6\u03bc \u03c4\u03bc )4 ) .\n(2.20)\nSince \u03a6a \u03a6a = tr ((\u03a6 \u2212\nin terms of traces:\n\n1\n2\n\n1 tr (\u03a6))2 ) = tr (\u03a62 ) \u2212 21 tr (\u03a6) tr (\u03a6), we can rewrite this expression\n\n\u0001\nS = \u03b3 (2a + r) tr (\u03a62 ) \u2212 a tr (\u03a6) tr (\u03a6) + g tr (\u03a64 ) .\n\n(2.21)\n\nAs in the case of the pure matrix model, one can decompose \u03a6 into the product \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ,\nwhere \u03a9 is a unitary matrix and \u039b = diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ). The Dyson measure d\u03bcD (\u03a6) will again\nsplit into the measure on the space of eigenvalues d\u03bb1 d\u03bb2 and the Vandermonde determinant\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2 . In total, the partition function for L = 1 reads as\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\nZa,r,g =\nd\u03bb1 d\u03bb2 (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2 e\u2212\u03b2\u03b3 (a(\u03bb1 \u2212\u03bb2 ) +r(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 )+g(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 )) .\n(2.22)\nWe will use this special case for comparison with our perturbative results for general N .\n3.\n3.1.\n\nPerturbative expansion of the model\nMotivation\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, our goal will be to turn fuzzy scalar field theory into\na multitrace matrix model. Since we do not know of any direct route to integrating out the\nangular degrees of freedom exactly, we will have to resort to perturbative techniques. This\napproach is also suggested by the lattice analysis of scalar \u03c64 -theory on R2 , where a hopping\nparameter \u2013 or high-temperature \u2013 expansion has been successfully used, see e.g. [11] and\nreferences therein.\nAssuming that the coefficient of the kinetic term, a, is small \u2013 or equivalently that the\ncoefficients r and g are large, it clearly makes sense to expand the model in powers of a. To\ndemonstrate this, we use the high-temperature expansion to compute the specific heat of our\nmodel for N = 2. The results are shown in figure 1, where the specific heat C is plotted in\nthe case N = 2 for both the pure matrix model and the full theory with high temperature\nexpansion up to O(a8 ). In the pure matrix model, one clearly sees that the critical line of the\nthird order phase transition is a parabola. The plot corresponding to the full model shows\nthat the critical line for the second order phase transition is indeed a straight line, and the\nslope extracted from this data deviates from the numerical prediction by only 3.25%.\nNote that the matrix model phase transition is certainly also present in the full model,\nhowever, it is invisible in the second plot, as the scale of the maximum is far larger than\nthe scale of the parabolic valley. In general, for large g, the specific heat C := \u2202\u03b2\u2202 2 log Z\ninterpolates between 12 at large positive and negative r. However, there is an intermediate\nphase, where C approximates 41 which corresponds to the negative r phase of the pure matrix\nmodel, see figure 2.\n7\n\n\fC\n\nC\n\ng\n\ng\n\u2212r\n\nFigure 1: On the left, the specific heat C :=\n\n\u2212r\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b2 2\n\nlog Z for the pure matrix model with a = 0\n\nis plotted.

Note that the kinetic term only\ndepends on \u03a6a as C2 annihilates \u03c40 \u223c 1.

This matrix contains the angular information on \u03a6 and has to be integrated over at the\nend. We thus have\n\u03a6a = tr (\u03c4 a \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ) ,\n(3.3)\nand we need to compute\nZ\n\nd\u03bcH (\u03a9)Kab tr (\u03c4 a \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ) tr (\u03c4 b \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 )\n8\n\n(3.4)\n\n\fat first order and\nZ\nd\u03bcH (\u03a9)Kab Kcd tr (\u03c4 a \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ) tr (\u03c4 b \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ) tr (\u03c4 c \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 ) tr (\u03c4 d \u03a9\u039b\u03a9\u2020 )\n\n(3.5)\n\nat second order.\nAfter rewriting these expressions as sums over traces in irreducible representations, we\ncan apply the orthogonality relation3\nZ\n1\nd\u03bcH (\u03a9) [\u03c1(\u03a9)]ij [\u03c1\u2020 (\u03a9)]kl =\n\u03b4il \u03b4jk ,\n(3.6)\ndim(\u03c1)\nto perform the angular integration.

The first term is new, and corrects the matrix model. Note that it has\nthe right sign to be exponentiated again and keep the partition function well-defined.\nOne is clearly tempted to conjecture that at nth order in the high-temperature expansion,\nP\nthe term i>j (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2n is new, while all the other terms just correspond to terms in the\nTaylor expansion of corrections at smaller orders.

However, one has to integrate\nout the angular variables first and reduce the matrix model to the eigenvalue formulation.\nThis is due to the fact that the angular degrees of freedom are zero modes in the partition\nfunction and keeping them would render the saddle-point approximation invalid.\nIn the large N limit, we can define scaling limits for the coupling constants, such that all\nof the terms contribute. From the log-term, we see that we have to pull out a factor of N 2 .\nSupporting the validity of our approach is the fact that we can choose a scaling which agrees\nwith the scaling found numerically [8]:\na = N \u03b8a \u00e3 ,\n\nr = N \u03b8r r\u0303 ,\n\ng = N \u03b8g g\u0303\n\nand \u03bb(x) = N \u03b8\u03bb \u03bb\u0303(x) ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere\n\u03b8a = \u2212 21 ,\n\n\u03b8r =\n\n3\n2\n\n,\n\n\u03b8g = 1\n\nand \u03b8\u03bb =\n\n1\n4\n\n.\n\n(4.8)\n\nNote that the correct conversion is the following:\n\u03b8b = \u22121 + \u03b8r \u2212 \u03b8a + 2\u03b8\u03bb\n\nand \u03b8c = \u22121 + \u03b8g \u2212 2\u03b8a + 4\u03b8\u03bb ,\n\nwhere b and c are the coupling constant in the normalization of [8].\nAltogether, we have the following partition function:\nZ\nZ =\nD\u03bb exp(\u2212N 2 S\u0303) ,\n\n(4.9)\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere\nS\u0303 = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nZ\n\u0010\n2\n4\ndx r\u0303\u03bb\u0303 (x)+g\u0303 \u03bb\u0303 (x) +\n+\n\n1\n0\n\n4\u03c0\u00e32\n8 (\u03bb\u0303(x)\n\n\u0010\ndy \u2212 \u00e34 (\u03bb\u0303(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u0303(y))2\n4\n\n\u2212 \u03bb\u0303(y)) \u2212\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0011\u0011\nln |\u03bb\u0303(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u0303(y)|\n.\n\n(4.11)\n\nWith our scaling, the saddle-point method becomes exact in the large N limit.\nRewriting the integral over y in (4.11) as an integral over \u03bb\u0303(y) introduces the eigenvalue\ndensity u(\u03bb\u0303) = dy/d\u03bb\u0303, and the moments\nZ\nZ\n!\nc0 =\nd\u03bc\u0303 u(\u03bc\u0303) = 1 and ci =\nd\u03bc\u0303 u(\u03bc\u0303)\u03bc\u0303i , i = 1, . . . , 4\n(4.12)\nappear.

In this\nregion, the eigenvalue density (4.15) will become negative and therefore ill-defined. Looking\nat the polynomial part q(\u03bb) of u(\u03bb), we see that the transition should occur, when q(0) = 0.\nTogether with the normalization of c0 and the self-consistency condition for c2 , this gives a\ncritical curve C marking the critical values of g depending on the other parameters. Explicitly,\nC is defined by the following two branches:\n\u0011\np\n\u03c0 \u0010\n\u221263\u00e32 \u2212 8\u00e3r\u0303 + 16r\u0303 2 \u00b1 (4r\u0303 \u2212 \u00e3) 16r\u0303 2 \u2212 8\u00e3r\u0303 \u2212 95\u00e32 .\n(4.19)\nC\u00b1 =\n32\nThe same result can be obtained straightforwardly in a different manner: Let us again\nassume a symmetric eigenvalue density which allows us to turn to the action\n\u015c = s2 tr (\u03a62 ) + s2,2 ( tr (\u03a62 ))2 + s4 tr (\u03a64 ) .\n\n(4.20)\n\nFurthermore, we define the effective coupling \u015d2 = s2 + s2,2 h tr (\u03a62 )i. We can now treat our\nmodel as if it was a pure, single-trace hermitian matrix model with \u015d2 as the coefficient of the\nquadratic term. In the regime in which the eigenvalue density has support on two disjoint\n15\n\n\f\u221a\ncuts, we have the usual formula h tr (\u03a62 )i = \u2212 N2s\u015d42 . Using the equation \u015d2 = \u22122 N s4 for the\none-cut two-cut transition, we are lead to the rescaling of fields we used above and eventually\narrive at the curve C as a self-consistent solution.\nTo compare this phase transition to the ones obtained numerically, recall that in [8],\nthree distinct phases were found. The transition between the first and the second phase is\nof third6 order, i.e. the specific heat has a discontinuous first derivative at the curve roughly\ndescribed by equation (2.13). The transition between the second and the third phase is of\nsecond order, i.e. the specific heat diverges, and numerical results suggest that the critical\ncurve is approximately given by the equation\n\u221a\ng = (0.19 \u00b1 0.08) N r .\n(4.21)\nThe phase boundary we find is a deformation of the matrix model boundary, cf. fig.\n3. In this deformation, the region in which the one-cut solution is valid is increased by\nturning on a. This is in agreement with the predictions derived from the numerical results,\nthat the triple point at which the third-order phase transition meets the critical line of the\nsecond order transition is located at larger values of r than in the case of the pure matrix\nmodel transition. Therefore, our results suggest to interpret the turning point of the curve\ngiven by C \u00b1 as the rough location of the triple point, and we will use this interpretation in\nthe following section. A comparison with the numerical values confirms this interpretation.\nThe turning point is located at (r, g) \u2248 (\u22122.7, 0.25) which is to be compared to the result\n(r, g) = (\u22122.3\u00b1 0.2, 0.52\u00b1 0.02) from the numerical computations [8], a reasonable agreement\nfor a second order approximation.\nWe expect the critical curve (4.21) to emerge in a future discussion of the full solution\nspace to our multitrace matrix model.\ng\n\ng\n\n150\n\n150\n\n125\n\n125\n\n100\n\n100\n\n75\n\n75\n\n50\n\n50\n\n25\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n25\n\n\u2212r\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n\u2212r\n\n10\n\nFigure 3: The one-cut-two-cut transition for the matrix model and the boundary for the\nregion of validity of the one-cut solution to the multitrace matrix model for \u00e3 = 1.\n6\n\nA detailed calculation proving this will be presented in a future publication.\n\n16\n\n\f5.\n\nModification of the model\n\n5.1.\n\nN \u2192 \u221e limits of the model\n\nThe various limits with N \u2192 \u221e for scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere were discussed\nin [5]. To make these limits more transparent, note that we can obtain a noncommutative\ni z\u0304 \u03b2 :\ncoordinate on SF2 using the noncommutative analogue of the coordinate xi \u223c z \u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\ni\n\nx\u0302 =\n\ni\nR\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u00e2\u2020\u03b1 \u221a\n\nN2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u00e2\u03b2\n\nwith\n\nx\u0302i x\u0302i\n\nHN\u22121\n\n= R2 1\u0302\n\nHN\u22121\n\n,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere HN \u22121 is the two-oscillator Hilbert space with L = N \u22121 excitations. These coordinates\nsatisfy the algebra\n2R\n[x\u0302i , x\u0302j ] = i \u221a\n\u03b5ijk x\u0302k .\n(5.2)\nN2 \u2212 1\nThere are now the following large N limits:\n\u22b2 The limit of the commutative sphere S 2 , for which we simply take N \u2192 \u221e with fixed\nradius R.\n\u22b2 The noncommutative planar limit, in which we consider the tangent plane7 at the north\npole. That is, x\u03023 \u2192 R and therefore the correct limit is N 2 \u2192 \u221e and R2 = N2\u03b8 , which\nresults in the noncommutative coordinate algebra [x\u03021 , x\u03022 ] = i\u03b8 on R2\u03b8 .\n\u22b2 The ordinary planar limit, for which N \u2192 \u221e and R2 \u223c N 1\u2212\u03b5 with 0 > \u03b5 > 1. In this\nlimit, the coordinates x\u03021 , x\u03022 turn into the commutative coordinates on R2 .\n5.2.\n\nCommutative and noncommutative \u03c64 -theory on the plane\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the na\u0131\u0308ve action for scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere\nwill not reproduce standard \u03c64 -theory on R2 . There is a UV/IR mixing [21] even in the case\nof the fuzzy sphere, which is, however, finite for every finite value of L [5]. In [9], it was\nshown that the deviation from the commutative theory is given by tadpole diagrams, which\ncan be removed by modifying the action in the following way:\n\u0010 a\n\u0011\n\u0001\n2\n4\n\u03bb\nS\u0303 = \u03b3 tr\n,\n(5.3)\nR(L,\nt)\n\u03a6\n+\nr\n\u03a6\n+\ng\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\nC\nZ\n(C\n)\n+\nt\n\u2212\n2 L\n2\n2\nR2\nwhere ZL (C2 ) is a power series in C2 corresponding to wave function renormalization, and\nR(L, t) is a function logarithmically diverging for large L.\nThe numerically obtained structure of the phase diagram of fuzzy scalar field theory [8]\nsuggests a comparison with that of \u03c64 -theory on R2 , as the phase transition corresponding to\nthe line is also seen there: The existence of a second order phase transition in scalar \u03c64 -theory\non R2 has been rigorously established in [22]. This phase transition is due to spontaneously\nbroken reflection symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. The exact structure of the phase diagram was calculated\nonly later using lattice and other techniques [23]. It was found that for the model\nLE =\n7\n\n2\n1\n2 (\u2207\u03c6)\n\n+ 21 m2 \u03c62 + 41 \u03bb\u03c64 ,\n\nA more detailed discussion would use complex coordinates and the stereographic projection.\n\n17\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fthe phase transition on a lattice occurs along the line \u03bb = \u221210.24(3)m2 in the \u03bb-m2 -plane.\nNote that the third order phase transition stemming from the matrix model part together\nwith its triple point with the second order phase transition is absent. This phase finds,\nhowever, a nice interpretation in terms of \u03c64 -theory on the noncommutative plane. There,\nthe theory exhibits a new striped phase, which breaks translational invariance. This phase\nhas been predicted in [24] for d > 2 using a self-consistent Hartree treatment and in [25] via\na one-loop renormalization group analysis. Numerical evidence for the existence of such a\nnew phase has been found in [26]. As argued in [27], appendix B, a definitive confirmation\nof this result is still pending.\nAltogether, we conclude that na\u0131\u0308ve \u03c64 -theory on the fuzzy sphere serves most likely as\na regulator of \u03c64 -theory on the noncommutative plane. Furthermore, we expect that in the\nmodified model (5.3), the triple point moves off towards r = \u2212\u221e, which would be a clear hint\nfor a fuzzy field theory tending indeed to quantized \u03c64 -theory on the plane in the appropriate\nlarge N and R limits.\n5.3.\n\nModified fuzzy \u03c64 -theory\n\nLet us now study the effect of the wave function regularization on the phase diagram, assuming that ZL (C2 ) \u2248 1 + \u03baC2 . That is, we consider the modified action\n\u0011\n\u0010 a\n2\n4\n.\n(5.5)\n\u03a6(C\n+\n\u03baC\nC\n)\u03a6\n+\nr\n\u03a6\n+\ng\n\u03a6\nS\u0303 = \u03b3 tr\n2\n2 2\nR2\nThis modification is particularly simple to realize in our formalism, as it amounts to replacing\nthe kinetic matrix\nKab \u2192 \u01e8ab := Kab + \u03baKac Kcb .\n(5.6)\nWe thus have the following new quantities:\ntr (\u01e8) =\ntr (\u01e8 2 ) =\n\n2\n2\n1\n6 (N \u2212 1)N (N + 1)(3 + 2(N \u2212 1)\u03ba) ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n1\n30 N (N \u2212 1) (10 + 5(3N \u2212 4)\u03ba + 2(3N\n\n\u2212 9N 2 + 8)\u03ba2 ) .\n\n(5.7)\n\nTo have both contributions in \u01e8 survive the large N limit, \u03ba = N \u03b8\u03ba \u03ba\u0303 has obviously to\n \u0303 , and one can easily show that \u01e8\n \u0303 q\u01e8\n \u0303 is still\nscale with \u03b8\u03ba = \u22122. After rescaling, we have \u01e8\n \u0303\nnegligible compared to the contribution from ( tr \u01e8 )2 . A straightforward calculation shows\nthat a is simply replaced by\n(5.8)\n\u01ce = a(1 + 23 \u03ba(N 2 \u2212 1))\nin all equations, and we therefore have in the large N limit\n \u0303 = a(1 + 2 \u03ba\u0303) .\n\u01ce\n3\n\n(5.9)\n\nAs discussed above, increasing a moves the triple point away from the origin, so we verified\nthat introducing \u03ba has the desired effect.\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe gave an explicit algorithm for turning the kinetic term of a fuzzy scalar field theory\ninto a multitrace expression which behaves equivalently under the functional integral. This\n18\n\n\falgorithm uses a perturbative expansion of the kinetic term, and it produces the exact result\nin a \u2013 in principle \u2013 straightforward manner at every order in the perturbative series.\nExplicitly, we evaluated the multitrace terms for scalar \u03c64 -theory on the fuzzy sphere\nup to second order and presented the one-cut solution in the large N limit. We found that\nthis solution gives rise to a consistent deformation of the region of validity of the one-cut\nassumption in the case of the pure matrix model. Furthermore, this deformation exhibits\na turning point, whose location is in good agreement with the location of a triple point\nconjectured from the numerical data.\nEventually, we studied a modification of the original model which is believed to provide the\ncorrect regularization of two-dimensional \u03c64 -theory within the framework of fuzzy geometry.\nThe multitrace model arising from the deformed theory is a deformation of the multitrace\nmodel previously obtained and the observed changes in the phase diagram suggest that the\nmodification is indeed useful.\nIn a future paper, we will study the full solution space to the multitrace matrix model for\nboth the na\u0131\u0308ve and the modified \u03c64 -actions. Furthermore, we will try to apply the technique\nof orthogonal polynomials for solving the model exactly also at finite N . Also, we want to\nprobe the multitrace model numerically in order to gain solid data for comparing it with the\nfull fuzzy field theory.\nFurther directions for future research are also evident: As our rewriting of the kinetic term\nis independent of the potential, one can easily solve further models with different potentials,\nas e.g. \u03c66 -theory or even sine-Gordon theory on the fuzzy sphere. Also, field theories on\nmore general fuzzy spaces such as higher-dimensional complex projective spaces [28], fuzzy\nflag manifolds [29] and fuzzy projective algebraic varieties [30] are now accessible analytically.\nIn particular, one should study which aspects of non-renormalizability of e.g. \u03c66 -theory in\nfour dimensions remain, when the theory is considered on fuzzy CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 or fuzzy CP 2 .\nAfter scalar field theory and Yang-Mills theory on the fuzzy sphere have been approached\nanalytically, it might also be interesting to consider the matrix model corresponding to general\nrelativity on the fuzzy sphere, which has been constructed in [31].\nEventually, let us state a rather bold conjecture: Multitrace matrix models were first put\nforward and studied in the context of trying to define string theories with central charge\nc > 1 [19, 20]. It is well-known that such theories exhibit a phase transition with complex\ncritical exponent, an earmark of high instability, and this instability is believed to correspond\nto a crumpling of the Riemann surfaces. There is a natural class of multitrace matrix models\nwhich arises from applying our approach to scalar field theories on the fuzzy sphere and fuzzy\nRiemann surfaces8 of higher genera. Furthermore, the truncation of the algebra of functions\nprovides a rather natural mechanism for keeping the Riemann surfaces from crumpling in an\nuncontrolled way. It might indeed be worthwhile to look for a connection between fuzzy field\ntheories and the long-sought definition of c > 1 string theories.\n8\n\nFor a definition of such spaces, see e.g. [32]. Alternatively, one can define them by considering an embedding of the Riemann surfaces into P n and using the techniques of [30].\n\nC\n\n19\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Wolfgang Bietenholz, Sergey Cherkis, Francis Dolan, Vladimir Kazakov, Sean Murray, Werner Nahm, Alexander Povolotsky, Harold Steinacker and\nSebastian Uhlmann for useful conversations in relation with this work.

The measure d\u03bcH (\u03a9) is the Haar measure9 on SU(N ) normalized\nR\naccording to d\u03bcH (\u03a9) = 1.\nWe briefly recall the proof of this relation, as given e.g. in [33]. Consider the integral\nR\nI = d\u03bcH (\u03a9)\u03c1(\u03a9)A\u03c1\u2020 (\u03a9). Using the identity \u03c1(\u03a5)I\u03c1\u2020 (\u03a5) = I, which is a trivial consequence\nof the Haar measure being invariant under translations \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a5\u03a9, \u03a5 \u2208 SU(N ), one can\nshow that \u03c1(\u03a5)I = I\u03c1(\u03a5). Thus, we conclude by Schur's lemma that I = c1. Choosing\nR\nAmn = \u03b4mj \u03b4nk , we obtain d\u03bcH (\u03a9)[\u03c1(\u03a9)]ij [\u03c1\u2020 (\u03a9)]kl = cjk \u03b4il .
