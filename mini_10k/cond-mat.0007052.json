Here we develop a manybody theoretical approach to the quadratic decay rate, energy loss, and wake potential of charged\nparticles moving in an interacting free electron gas. Explicit expressions for these quantities are\nobtained either within the random-phase approximation (RPA) or with full inclusion of short-range\nexchange and correlation effects. The Z13 correction to the energy loss of ions is evaluated beyond\nRPA, in the limit of low velocities.\n\nculations, which do not have the limitation of being restricted to low projectile velocities, have been reported by\ndifferent authors with use of the random-phase approximation (RPA) and by treating the moving charged particle as a prescribed source of energy and momentum.11\u201315\nIn this paper, we report a many-body theoretical approach to the quadratic decay rate, energy loss, and wake\npotential of charged particles moving in an interacting\nFEG. The decay rate is derived from the knowledge of the\nprojectile self-energy. The energy loss and wake potential are obtained within quadratic response theory. While\nthe first-order contribution to the energy loss may also be\nobtained from the imaginary part of the projectile selfenergy by simply inserting the energy transfer inside the\nintegrand of this quantity, our results indicate that this\nprocedure cannot be generalized to the description of the\nsecond-order energy loss. Unless otherwise is stated, we\nuse atomic units throughout, i.e., e2 = h\u0304 = me = 1.\nWe consider the interaction of a moving probe particle of charge Z1 and mass M with a FEG of density n.\nThe probe particle is assumed to be distinguishable from\nthe electrons in the Fermi gas, which is described by an\nisotropic homogeneous assembly of interacting electrons\nimmersed in a uniform background of positive charge and\nvolume V . Many-body theory shows that the probability\nfor the probe particle to occupy a given excited state of\nfour-momentum p decays exponentially in time with the\ndecay constant16\n\nWhen charged particles pass through a solid, energy\ncan be lost to the medium through various types of elastic and inelastic collision processes.1 While at relativistic velocities radiative losses may become important, for\nmoving charged particles in the non-relativistic regime\nthe energy loss is primarily due to electron-electron (e-e)\ninteractions giving rise to the generation of electron-hole\npairs, collective excitations such as plasmons, and innershell excitations and ionizations. Energy losses due to\nnuclear recoil are negligible, unless the projectile velocity is very small compared to the mean speed of electrons\nin the solid.2\nThe inelastic decay rate of charged particles in a degenerate interacting free electron gas (FEG) has been\ncalculated for many years in the first-Born approximation or, equivalently, within linear-response theory. This\nis a good approximation when the velocity of the projectile is much greater than the average velocity of target electrons. However, in the case of projectiles moving\nwith smaller velocities, nonlinearities have been shown to\nplay a key role in the interpretation of a variety of experiments. Energy-loss measurements have revealed differences, not present within linear-response theory, between\nthe energy loss of protons and antiprotons.3,4 Moreover, experimentally observed coherent double-plasmon\nexcitations5,6 cannot be described within linear-response\ntheory, and nonlinearities may also play an important\nrole in the electronic wake generated by moving ions in\na FEG.7\nPioneering nonlinear calculations of the electronic energy loss of low-energy ions in an electron gas were performed by Echenique et al .8 These authors computed the\nscattering cross section for a statically screened potential,\nwhich was determined self-consistently using densityfunctional theory (DFT).9 These static-screening calculations have recently been extended to velocities approaching the Fermi velocity.10 Second-order perturbative cal-\n\n\u03c4 \u22121 = \u22122 Im\u03a3p ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3p represents the particle self-energy.\nIt is well known that the self-energy cannot be computed by simply evaluating the lowest-order Feynman diagrams, because of severe infrared divergences due to the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction. Instead, one needs to\nresum electron-loop corrections and expand in terms of\nthe dynamically screened interaction. Up to third order\n1\n\n\fin Z1 , the self-energy of the probe particle can be represented diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 1. The sum\nof the first two diagrams represents the so-called GW\napproximation, and the third diagram accounts for Z13\ncorrections.

(15)\ndivided by the velocity of the projectile, as a function of the electron-density parameter rs .25 Comparison\nbetween our new results (solid and short-dashed lines)\nand those obtained within RPA (long-dashed and dotted\nlines) indicates that xc effects become increasingly important as the electron density decreases, the impact of\nthese effects being more pronounced for the Z13 than for\nthe Z12 contribution to the energy loss. As a result, the\nimportance of the quadratic contribution increases when\nxc effects are included, and for rs \u223c 2.5 it is equal in\nmagnitude to the linear contribution [within RPA, linear\nand quadratic contributions are equal for rs \u223c 5].\nThe crosses and rhombs in Fig. 2 represent the full\nnonlinear contribution to the energy loss [difference between the total energy loss and the linear contribution],\nmultiplied by a factor of \u22121, as obtained from DFT calculations for antiprotons to all orders in Z1 ,26 with xc effects excluded (crosses) and with LDA xc effects included\n(rhombs). Both full nonlinear calculations are found to\nagree nicely with our quadratic-response calculations in\nthe high-density limit (rs \u2192 0). As the electron density\ndecreases, quadratic-response calculations overestimate\nthe energy loss of antiprotons, especially when xc effects\nare included, showing that xc and nonlinear (beyond Z13 )\neffects tend to compensate.\nFinally, we note that linear and quadratic contributions to the energy loss can be extracted from the smallZ1 behaviour of full nonlinear DFT calculations, which\nhave been reported in the low-velocity limit.8 When\n(\u2212dE/dx)/Z12 is plotted as a function of Z1 , the result has a linear Z1 dependence at small Z1 . The intercept and the slope of this curve at Z1 = 0 give linear and quadratic contributions to the full nonlinear energy loss, as shown in Ref. 12 by simply ignoring xc effects. These authors repeated their full nonlinear DFT\ncalculations with LDA xc included, but were unable to\ncompare them with quadratic-response calculations that\nincluded xc effects at the same level of approximation.\nThe results of these quadratic-response calculations are\nnow shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the ratio\nbetween xc-included (short-dashed line) and xc-excluded\n(dotted line) quadratic contributions to the energy loss\nis in excellent agreement with the ratios reported in Ref.\n12 [see Fig. 7 of this reference] as derived from the Z1 dependence of full nonlinear DFT calculations.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a many-body theoretical approach to the quadratic decay rate, energy loss,\nand wake potential of charged particles moving in an electrons gas, with full inclusion of short-range xc effects.\nWe have shown that in the limit of high electron densities and low projectile charges our calculated quadratic\nenergy loss, which can be extended to the case of larger\n\nZ\n\n(15)\n\nBoth Eq. (6) for the decay rate and Eq. (15) for the\nenergy loss can be derived, within many-body perturbation theory, from the knowledge of the probability for\nthe probe particle to transfer four-momentum q to the\nFEG.20 Nevertheless, this probability cannot be identified with the integrand of Eq. (6), and therefore the\nenergy loss of Eq. (15) cannot be obtained by simply\ninserting the energy transfer inside the integrand of Eq.\n(6).\nIn the framework of time-dependent density-functional\ntheory (TDDFT),21 quadratic response theory yields\nR,0\n\u03c7R\n+ \u03c7R,0\n(vq + fqxc ) \u03c7R\nq ,\nq\nq = \u03c7q\n\n(16)\n\nR\nR\n,\nK\u0303\u2212q\nYqR1 ,q2 = K\u0303qR1 Yq01 ,q2 K\u0303\u2212q\n3\n2\n\n(17)\n\nKqR = 1 + \u03c7R\nq vq ,\n\n(18)\n\nxc\nK\u0303qR = 1 + \u03c7R\nq (vq + fq ),\n\n(19)\n\nand\n\nrepresent retarded noninteracting\nwhere \u03c7R,0\nand YqR,0\nq\n1 ,q2\ndensity correlation functions, and fqxc denotes the Fourier\ntransform of\nf xc (x, x\u2032 ) =\n\n\u03b4V xc ([n], x)\n,\n\u03b4n(x\u2032 )\n\n(20)\n\nV xc ([n], x) being the exact time-dependent xc potential\nof TDDFT.21 . Within RPA fqxc = 0, and introduction of\nEqs. (17) and (18) into Eqs. (14) and (15) then yields\nthe results derived in Refs. 11\u201315.\nAt this point, we present an application of our formalism, namely the low-velocity limit of the energy loss with\ninclusion of short-range xc effects. For low projectile veR,0\nlocities (v \u2192 0), only the static (\u03c9 \u2192 0) \u03c7R,0\nq , Yq1 ,q2 ,\nxc\nand fq enter in the evaluation of the energy loss of Eq.\n(15), which is then easily found to be proportional to the\nprojectile velocity. In particular, in the so-called localdensity approximation (LDA), which is rigorous in the\nlong-wavelength limit (q \u2192 0), one finds\n\u0014\n\u0015\n4\u03c0 1 4\u03c0 d2 Ec\nxc\nfq = 2\n,\n(21)\n\u2212\nqF 4 qF2 dn2\nEc (n) being the correlation energy of a uniform electron\ngas of density n.\nDiffusion Monte Carlo calculations of \u03c70q have shown\nthat the LDA static xc kernel of Eq.
