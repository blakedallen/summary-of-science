Supersymmetry (SUSY)[1] is regarded as a widely\nfavored candidate.\nSUSY with beautiful mathematical grace is good almost in all senses: the\nquadratically divergent contributions to the scalar sector are canceled, the light\nHiggs boson is predicted, the SUSY particle spectra contain the dark matter\ncandidates. SUSY allows the unification of all known fundamental forces and,\n\u2217\n\nOn leave of absence from Institute of Physics, Baku, Azerbaijan\n\n\fpresumable, allows explanation of baryon asymmetry in the universe, superstring theory naturally incorporates SUSY.\nTo exclude some unwanted superpotential terms and provide the proton\nlongevity the SUSY theories are usually supplied with discrete symmetry \u2013\nR-parity conservation[4]1. As a consequence, the SUSY superpartners of the\nStandard Model (SM) particles are produced in pairs and decay to a SM particle\nand the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The LSP is neutral, stable and\nweakly interacting and usually identified as the lightest neutralino or gravitino\nescaping the detector unseen.\nUnfortunately, the origin of SUSY breaking is not enough explored yet. The\nparametrization of soft SUSY breaking in supersymmetric Lagrangian density\nis now the basis of many models used in SUSY searches in collider experiments.\nAmong them are the models with graviton, gauge and anomaly mediated soft\nSUSY breaking terms. Soft parameters can be determined from the LHC and\nILC data if SUSY is discovered.\nThe most popular SUSY breaking mechanism is realized in minimal supergravity (mSUGRA)[5], where the SUSY breaking mediated from \"hidden\" to\nthe \"visible\" sector by gravitational interactions. These models are strongly\nmotivated, consistent with experimental data, and simple enough to explore in\ncurrent collider experiments2. In mSUGRA five parameters, four continuous\nand one discrete,\nm0 , m1/2, A0, tan\u03b2, sign(\u03bc),\nare enough to calculate superpartner masses and mixings. Here m0 is the common mass for scalars, m1/2 is the common gaugino mass, A0 is the common soft\ntrilinear SUSY breaking parameter, sign(\u03bc) is the sign of the Higgsino mass\nterm, tan\u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two Higgs doublets\ngiving mass to the up and down type quarks. The parameters m0 , m1/2, A0\nare defined at the grand unification scale and tan\u03b2 at the electroweak scale.\nNote that low-energy parametrization of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model contains up to 120 parameters arising mainly in the soft symmetry\nbreaking terms.\nIntensive searches for manifestation of SUSY at the Tevatron were performed\nby CDF and D0 collaborations (see e.g. Ref. [7] and refs therein). The LEP\n1\n\nThe KK-parity conserving universal extra dimension[2] models and little Higgs[3] models with conserved\nT-parity as extensions of the Standard Model, predicts their own candidates for dark matter.\n2\nAbout some problems in mSUGRA and its solutions see e.g. Ref. [6].\n\n\fand HERA Collaborations also looked for SUSY in a variety of channels (see\nRefs. [8, 9]).\nThe ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed search strategies[10, 11]\ncovering different SUSY breaking schemes and event topologies.\nAt the hadron colliders the inclusive production of squarks and gluinos via\nstrong interaction dominate over associated production of charginos and neutralinos and is one of the most promising discovery channels for SUSY.\nIn this paper, we restrict ourselves to the study of the squark pair production\nin pp collisions at the center-of-mass energy ECM = 10 TeV. This channel\nsuffers from high backgrounds from QCD jet events. The requirement of high\nmissing transverse energy values effectively rejects this background. We will also\nfocus on the azimuthal angle between two hardest jets, the variables mT 2[12]\nand \u03b1[13]. To eliminate multistep cascade decays of squarks we choose the\nparameter point of mSUGRA where squarks are lighter than the gluinos. In\nthis case, the primary decay modes are q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u03030i . Thus, the squark pair will\nbe presented in the interaction products as two quarks and two neutralinos.\nThe final state exhibits missing energy and no mass peaks can be directly\nreconstructed.\nIn addition to the QCD events, the main background to SUSY dijet signatures are electroweak processes such as W + jets, Z + jets, tt + jets events.\nWe find that the diboson production rate in the background is negligibly small\nfor this study.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section gives a brief\ndescription of signal and background events, the choice of the SUSY benchmark point and some parameters of the generic LHC detector. Section 3 gives\nour strategy for the search for SUSY dijet events. We make use of different\nkinematic variables and examine signal and background events. In this Section\nwe also make an estimate of the q\u0303 \u0304q\u0303 signal-to-background ratio. The impact\nof the calorimeter energy resolution, initial- and final-state radiation and jet\nreconstruction algorithm to the dijet variable distributions are studied. We end\nwith the conclusions in Section 4.\n\n\f2\n\nSignal and Standard Model background simulations\nfor the generic LHC detector\n\nIn order to study the ability of the LHC to observe the SUSY dijet events\nat ECM = 10 TeV we used the PYTHIA6.4[14] event generator for signal and\nQCD background simulation. The ALPGEN2.12[15] code was used for tt + nj,\nW + nj, Z + nj and diboson samples, where nj denotes n light jets. It was\ninterfaced with PYTHIA for subsequent jet showering and hadronization. We\ninclude the following processes in our background analysis: 0-2 jets in tt, 0-3\njets in Z and 0-4 jets in W events. Only in one diboson (ZZ, ZW, WW) event\nfor 1 fb\u22121 of data set the sum of the transverse momenta of two hardest jets\nbecomes greater than 500 GeV (see below).\nFor this analysis, we used the mSUGRA scenario with the commonly used\nSPS1a'[16] benchmark point. The model parameters at this point are m0 =\n70 GeV, m1/2 = 250 GeV, A0 = \u2212300 GeV, tan\u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0. We used\nthe SPheno[17] package for calculating the sparticle mass spectra, decay widths\nand branching ratios. The benchmark point used lead to a SUSY particle\nspectrum with m\u03c710 \u223c98 GeV, mq\u0303 \u223c550 GeV, mg\u0303 \u223c608 GeV. The total leadingorder cross section of squark pair production at this point is \u223c4.65 pb if the\ntransverse momentum of the outgoing partons in the hard scattering process is\ngreater than 50 GeV.\nWe use the central values of leading-order parton distribution function set\nfrom CTEQ6L1[18] and do not change the PYTHIA6.4 default choices for Q2\ndefinition as well as factorization/renormalization scales. The initial- and finalstate QCD and QED radiation (IFSR) and multiple interactions (MI) were\nenabled.\nThe detector performance was simulated by using the publicly available PGS4[19] package written by J. Conway and modified by S. Mrenna for the generic\nLHC detector. The calorimeter granularity is set to (\u2206\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2206\u03b7) = (0.10 \u00d7 0.10).\nEnergy smearing in the hadronic calorimeter of the generic LHC detector is\ngoverned by3\na\n\u2206E\n= \u221a \u2295b\n(E in GeV ),\nE\nE\nwhere the stochastic term factor is a = 0.8 and the constant factor is b = 0.03.\n3\n\nWe add the constant term to the PGS-4 simulation of energy smearing in the hadronic calorimeter.\n\n\fJets were reconstructed down to |\u03b7| \u2264 3 using the kT algorithm implemented\nin PGS-4. We chose D = 0.4 for the jet resolution parameter and required that\nboth leading jets carried a transverse momentum p1,2\nT > 50 GeV.\nIn order to suppress backgrounds from the semileptonic SM and SUSY processes we select events without any isolated muon, electron, tau or photon with\npT > 20 GeV. We use the simplified output from PGS-4, namely, a list of two\nmost energetic jets.\nWe simulated signal and background events at the rates corresponding to\n1 fb\u22121 of accumulated data.

In Fig. 1 we\nplot signal and background events binned in ETmiss and HTmiss. The only selection\ncriterion requires a hard cut of 500 GeV on the sum of the transverse momenta\nof two hardest jets. A comparison of the left and right panels of Fig. 1 shows\nthat the effectiveness of background restrictions based on the ETmiss and HTmiss\ncuts would significantly differ towards high values of these variables. In Table 1\nwe present the signal-to-background ratio, S/B, for different selection\ncuts for\n\u221a\nETmiss. It would be possible to achieve the signal significance4 S/ S + B of\nabout 10.5 with the accumulated data of 1 fb\u22121 using only the ETmiss cut. With\nonly the cuts on HTmiss it is impossible to get signal significance even close to 3.\nBesides being of physics origin, events with the missing transverse energy\nalso have other sources. Mismeasurements of the energy of jets, incomplete\n4\n\nWe follow the tradition but can say that if no robust signature in the mass peak is observable, the use of\nthis signal significance is not so compelling.\n\n\f10 6\n\n10 6\n\n10 5\n\n10 5\n\n10 4\n\n10 4\n\n10 3\n\n10 3\n\n10 2\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nFigure 4: Expected ETmiss distributions for signal events at the SPS1a' benchmark point (left)\nand QCD background events with and without initial- and final-state radiation, for different\nconstant terms b in the hadron calorimeter resolution expression, and with the jet cone algorithm (right). LHC operation at ECM = 10 TeV and integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 is\nassumed.\n\ncoverage of the calorimeters, large electronic noise, etc. would lead to a large\nETmiss signal. For this reason, in the early stage of the LHC running it may\nnot be possible to use ETmiss as a signal/background discrimination variable. In\nwhat follows we do not implement any ETmiss requirement.\nThe dijet angular distribution is a useful measurement to probe the SM\nprocesses as well as new physics manifestation. In Fig. 2 we plot the normalized\ndijet angular distribution, 1/N dN/d\u2206\u03c6, where \u2206\u03c6=\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 for two leading jets.\nThe signal event distribution is nearly flat in contrast to the background event\ndistributions.\nAn important quantity which in principle allows observing squarks and determining them masses and masses of their invisible decay products is the mT 2[12].\nInspired by the transverse mass mT in the W \u2192 l\u03bd decay this variable is\nsometimes called the stransverse mass.

The signal significance of 8.2 is achievable using the\nmT 2 cut alone and \u223c10 with the combination of mT 2 and ETmiss .

Further, we\nestimate that a factor of \u223c2.3 less integrated luminosity is required at 14 TeV,\nand a factor of about 2.5 more at 7 TeV, to achieve the same signal sensitivity\nas at 10 TeV.\nRecently, the new measurable \u03b1[13] has been proposed which can be used\nas a signal/background discriminating variable in squark pair production. This\nanalysis does not explicitly require the ETmiss cut. The variable \u03b1 is defined as\nthe ratio of the second hardest jet transverse momentum to the invariant mass\nm1,2\ninv of two hardest jets\np2T\n\u03b1 = 1,2 .\nminv\nIn Fig. 3 (right panel) we show the \u03b1 distributions for the signal and background events. As one can see, the clean SUSY signal at larger \u03b1 values is not\nviable due to a bigger tail of the QCD background distribution. The \u03b1 > 0.6\nsignal is 45 times weaker than the SM background.\n\n\f10 6\n\n10 6\n\n10 5\n\n10 5\n\n10 4\n\n10 4\n\n10 3\n\n10 3\n\n10 2\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 7: Same as in Fig. 4 but for \u03b1 distribution.\n\nTo get further insight, in Figs. 4-7 we show what happens with the ETmiss, \u2206\u03c6,\nmT 2 and \u03b1 distributions of the signal and QCD background events when IFSR\nare switched off in the simulated events. The impact of the constant term b in\nthe calorimeter energy resolution formula and jet definition algorithm is also\ndemonstrated in these figures. The cyan histogram in the figures corresponds\nto the cone jet definition algorithm with the cone radius R = 0.7. The signal\nevent distributions are robust to all these influences. The presence of IFSR\nsignificantly increases the QCD background for all these distributions at large\nvalues of the ETmiss , mT 2 and \u03b1 and small values of \u2206\u03c6. We can see that the\nmissing transverse energy for the QCD background at large values of ETmiss is\nless susceptible to the IFSR. The impact of the MI on the mT 2 distribution\nof the signal events is demonstrated in Fig. 8. One can see that the upper\nedge of these distributions indicates to the mass of the parent squark. The\nexperimental resolution leads to the smearing of the correct mass point.\nFinally, we remark that the behavior of the \u03b1 distribution of the QCD background without IFSR in Fig. 7 looks surprisingly like the ones obtained in\nRefs. [13, 24].\n\n\f50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nFigure 8: Expected mT 2 distributions for signal events with initial- and final-state radiation\nand multiple interactions and without them when the sum of the momenta of two hardest jets\nis greater than 500 GeV.

The our attention was focused on\nthe distinctive characteristics of background subtractions in q\u0303 \u0304q\u0303 production for\nthe mSUGRA benchmark point SPS1a' where the squarks are light.\nWith 1 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, strong evidence for a q\u0303 \u0304q\u0303 can appear with\nhard cuts on the missing transverse energy and stransverse mass distributions.\nIn the mSUGRA model with a benchmark point SPS1a' it is possible to reach\na signal significance 5\u03c3 of statistical uncertainty with 0.4 fb\u22121 of accumulated\ndata when LHC operates at ECM = 10 TeV.\nWe find that initial- and final- state radiation forms a crucial background for\nthe \u03b1[13] distribution of the q\u0303 \u0304q\u0303 signal. It should be hard to pick out the signal\nagainst the background in SUSY dijet events using the measured \u03b1 distribution\n\n\feven with a tandem of other measurables. The variable \u03b1 not can provide an\nobvious advantage for discovery of q\u0303 \u0304q\u0303 as was stated previously.\nThe careful validation of the whole richness of new physics at the LHC will\nbe possible with improvement of our understanding of the known physics.\n\nReferences\n[1] Yu.A.
