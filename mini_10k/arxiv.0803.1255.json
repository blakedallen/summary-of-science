Wide spectral ranges are explored with Dopplerlimited resolution. Fast data acquisition, accurate measurements of frequency, intensity, and\nline shape; time-resolved, selective spectra are achieved with excellent sensitivities.\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nOver the past few years, high sensitivity spectroscopic techniques have gained in\nefficiency and several experimental schemes now enable to reach ppb detection levels. One of\nthe prevailing quests presently aims at combining these sensitivities with rapid diagnostic\nand/or multi-species gas analysis. This induces new approaches able to couple broadband\ncoherent sources to multiplex or multichannel spectrometers. Nowadays at high spectral\nresolution, simultaneous spectral coverage is still often restricted [1-3] to a few nanometers\ndue to multichannel grating spectrometer limitation and/or to narrow spectral range optical\nsource capabilities. With the breakthrough of mode-locked femtosecond (fs) lasers and\nfrequency combs [4], extremely broad \"steady state\" high quality coherent sources have\nbecome available. This prompted the need for related spectral approaches able to deliver at\nonce high resolution, high accuracy, broad spectral coverage and rapid acquisition. Purposely,\na broadband frequency comb was coherently coupled [5] to a high finesse cavity across 100\nnm, with an equivalent absorption path equal to 1.13 km. Nevertheless, due to lack of\nappropriate spectroscopic method, this recent impressive experiment provided simultaneous\nspectral results limited to 15 nm, 25 GHz resolution with signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the\norder of 15. Finally with the same purpose, a broadband cw Cr2+:ZnSe laser used for\nintracavity absorption spectroscopy was coupled [6] to a high resolution time-resolved Fourier\ntransform interferometer. A simultaneous coverage of 125 nm was obtained with 330 MHz\nresolution, 2.5 km equivalent absorption path length and SNR equal to 100.\nWith the above motivations in mind, a mode-locked femtosecond laser source has been\nefficiently analyzed by a high resolution commercial Fourier transform spectrometer. This\npaper reports this first-step experiment with the illustrating C2H2 spectra covering 118 nm in\nthe 1540 nm region. The perspectives in terms of high sensitivity spectroscopy, especially in\nthe infrared region, are then examined.\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nThe present experiment is based on the coupling of a Cr4+:YAG mode-locked laser\nsource emitting in the 1.45 \u03bcm region to a Fourier transform spectrometer. Cr4+:YAG lasers\nhave the ability to produce pulses as short as 20 fs [7] in the wavelength range from 1250 to\n1600 nm. These femtosecond lasers operate at room temperature, may be diode-pumped [8]\nand have larger gain bandwidths than Er-doped fiber lasers. The experimental set-up is\nschematized on Fig. 1. A 1064 nm commercial Nd:YVO4 laser pumps a 20-mm-long\nCr4+:YAG Brewster-cut crystal. Its beam is focused onto the crystal through the dichroic\nmirror M1 by a 75-mm-focal-length lens. The crystal is temperature-stabilized with a thermoelectric cooler to about 286 K. The astigmatically-compensated X-shaped cavity consists of\ntwo spherical mirrors M1 and M2 with 100 mm radius of curvature (ROC), four plane chirped\nmirrors (CM) from Layertec M3, M4, M6, M7, a 0.8 %-transmission plane output coupler\n(OC), a concave focusing mirror M5 with ROC 100 mm and a semiconductor saturable\nabsorber mirror (SESAM) from Batop on a heat sink. The CM have second-order dispersion\nof approximately -100 fs2 and third-order dispersion of -800 fs3 per bounce at 1500 nm. They\nprovide high reflectivity (> 99.9%) in the range 1300-1730 nm. The two collimated arms\nrespectively are 45 and 41 cm long. The cavity is in the open air. Laser threshold occurs at\nabout 2.0 W of pumping power and 5.5 W (about 60 % absorbed) are enough to get stable\nmode-locked operation with pulse repetition rate of about 150 MHz and an average power of\n150 mW typically measured at the output of the oscillator.\nThe laser beam passes through a 80-cm cell filled with acetylene in natural abundance\n(pressure equal to 128 hPa). It is analyzed by a commercial rapid-scan Fourier transform\nspectrometer (Bruker IFS66) as if it was a steady-state source. The spectrometer is equipped\nwith a fluorine beam-splitter and an InGaAs detector. High resolution may be reached using a\nfemtosecond laser source since the narrow molecular absorbing lines enhance the light\ncoherence length up to a resolution limited by their linewidth. Figure 2 gives an illustration of\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nthe resulting spectra. The whole spectral domain of laser emission extends over 118 nm (500\ncm-1) with a full width at half maximum of 46 nm (197 cm-1). Since the pulse duration is not\ncrucial in our experiment, no autocorrelation measurement of the pulse width was performed.\nNevertheless, assuming the classical Fourier transform-limited sech shape, we estimate a\npulse duration of 54 fs for a spectral bandwidth of 46 nm at 1530 nm. The spectral bandwidth\nrestriction on the lower wavelength side comes from the SESAM reflectivity. Resolution is\nlimited by the spectrometer to 6 GHz (0.2 cm-1). The number of spectral elements M is\nconsequently equal to 2500 (500 cm-1/0.2 cm-1). Ten scans are co-added and the fringes are\nscanned at a 10 kHz rate. The resulting total recording time T is 7.9 s. The SNR, estimated\nfrom the rms noise, is better than 1000. Noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second\naveraging per spectral element corresponding to (L x SNR)-1 x (T/M)1/2 where L is the\nabsorption path length is equal to 7 10-7 cm-1.Hz-1/2. For comparison, a spectrum using a\nconventional tungsten lamp recorded under identical experimental conditions exhibits a signal\nto noise ratio reduced by about 12. Due to the high brightness of the femtosecond laser, for\nidentical results, the present recording time is then about 144 shorter than with the most\nwidely used white source in near infrared absorption FTS.\nAll absorption lines shown on Fig.2 are due to acetylene. The most intense band is the\n\n\u03bd1+\u03bd3 band of 12C2H2. This acetylene isotopologue belongs to the point group D \u221e h. Since its\npair of identical nuclei with a nuclear spin different from zero ( I(H) = 1\u20442 ), follows the Fermi\nstatistics, even and odd rotational levels have statistical weights in the ratio of 1/3. Thanks to\nthe high resolution revealing the rotational structure, the intensity alternation for the main\nband is obvious. A small part of the spectrum with an extended frequency scale is given on\nFig. 3. with spectral assignments. Due to the good SNR, the \u03bd1+\u03bd3 band of H12C13CH is\nclearly seen even with a relative concentration decreased by about 100. The absence of\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nintensity alternation due to the break of the molecular symmetry of this isotopologue is also\nrevealed on the figure.\nThe coupling of Fourier transform spectrometers to mode-locked sources offers new\nperspectives for high resolution and high sensitivity broadband absorption spectroscopy. This\nexperiment may indeed be improved in terms of sensitivity, spectral domain, resolution and\nacquisition time, as discussed below.\nSensitivity may be enhanced by increasing the interaction path between light and\nsample. The most promising spectra should result from the coupling demonstrated in [5] of a\nfemtosecond frequency comb to a high finesse cavity. More precisely using a 39.4 cm long\ncell, corresponding to 380 MHz free spectral range, [5] reports an integrated absorption equal\nto 2.5 10-5 with 1.4 ms acquisition time. Their grating spectrometer has 15 nm bandwidth\n(from 809 to 824 nm) at 25 GHz resolution, corresponding to 270 spectral elements.\nTherefore, using the formula (L x SNR)-1 x (T/M)1/2 given above, their noise equivalent\nabsorption coefficient at one second averaging is 1.4 10-9 cm-1.Hz-1/2 per spectral element.\nTheir set-up involves a cavity with a finesse equal to 4500, which corresponds to about 1.13\nkm equivalent path length. Absorption path of 80 m is rather common in the laboratory with a\nclassical multipass cell. It is therefore worth noticing that a 100-time increase of the present\nabsorption path length (80 cm) would already provide an integrated absorption equal to 10-5\nand a noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second averaging of 7 10-9 cm-1.Hz-1/2 per\nspectral element. With a much simpler experimental set-up, this integrated absorption would\nbe 2.5 times better than the one reported in [5] with only 5 times worse noise equivalent\nabsorption at one second averaging per spectral element.\nAny spectral domain, from the UV to the far-infrared, may be probed with Fourier\ntransform spectroscopy, most often with Doppler-limited resolution and with no other\nrestriction on the spectral simultaneous coverage than the detector responsivity. Typically, up\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nto several 106 independent spectral elements are sampled within one experiment. The\ntechnique is therefore appropriate even for supercontinua laser sources [9].\nResolving ability of the grating instruments suffer from drastic limitations when\ncompared to Fourier interferometers. This is due to the restricted size of the available gratings\nand the inability of a laser beam to cover the entire grating so to benefit from its full\nresolution. Commercially available Fourier spectrometers based on Michelson interferometers\nexhibit up to 30 MHz resolution. When using [10] a frequency comb as a Fourier\nspectrometer, this resolution has virtually no practical limitation. For instance, 1 MHzrepetition rate mode-locked oscillators have been demonstrated [11] or stroboscopic\napproaches may be implemented.\nVery short acquisition times are reachable with spectrometers presenting no moving\nparts like for instance grating, virtually imaged phased array [12], stationary Fourier\ninterferometers [13] all equipped with CCD array detector, and frequency comb Fourier\nspectrometer [10]. The frequency comb approach [10] has the advantage of needing a single\ndetector and therefore, in principle, does not suffer as the other techniques from a severe\nrestriction on the number of spectral elements. This limitation may be overcome at the\nreasonable expenses of acquisition time. In the ms acquisition time range, ultrafast scanning\nFourier Michelson interferometers are available [14]. If high resolution combined with high\nspectral bandwidth is needed, conventional fast-scanning Michelson interferometers appear as\nbeing the best solution: optical velocities in path difference are generally between 0.1 and 10\ncm.s\u22121, so that 75 MHz resolution may be reached with 106 spectral elements within only 20\nseconds. Time resolution ability with high spectral resolution is also at work [15].\nIn conclusion, we report the coupling for the first time of a femtosecond mode-locked\nlaser used as a broadband infrared source to a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer.\nAcetylene absorption spectra, recorded using a Cr4+:YAG laser, clearly show the efficiency of\n\n\fMolecular fingerprinting\n\nMandon, Guelachvili, Picqu\u00e9, 2008\n\nthis approach. Comparisons to recent experiments motivated by similar objectives are\nsatisfactory. Improvements in sensitivity, spectral extension, resolution and acquisition time\nby combining femtosecond broadband laser sources to Fourier spectrometers are in progress.\n\nUseful advices from Drs E.
