Two main topics are covered: first, the\nspectroscopy of charmed baryon states; second, the production of charmed baryons in the decays of B mesons and\nfrom the e+ e\u2212 continuum.\n\nSpectroscopy\nThere has been a steady progression of results on\ncharmed baryon spectroscopy from the e+ e\u2212 B-factories\nBABAR [4] and Belle [5] in recent years, building on the\nfoundations laid by CLEO, FOCUS, E687, ARGUS, and\nothers [6]. We summarize new and interesting results for\n\u03a3c , \u039ec , and then \u03a9c states.\n\n\u03a3c states\nBABAR has recently published a study of the decay\n\u2212\n6\nB \u2212 \u2192 \u039b+\nc p\u0304\u03c0 in a sample of 383 \u00d7 10 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB\n\u2212\n+\ndecays [7, 3] measuring B(B \u2192 \u039bc p\u0304\u03c0 \u2212 ) = (3.38 \u00b1\n0.12 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.88) \u00d7 10\u22124 [2]. This value is somewhat\nlarger than the previous Belle result of (2.01\u00b10.15\u00b10.20\u00b1\n0.52) \u00d7 10\u22124 from 152 \u00d7 106 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB decays [8].\nBoth papers see clear signals for B \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)0 p\u0304 in the\nDalitz plot, but a small or no signal for B \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3c (2520)0 p\u0304.\nBoth papers also observed a \u039b+\nc p\u0304 threshold enhancement,\ndiscussed later. In addition, BABAR noted a broad, sta\u2212\ntistically significant (5.8\u03c3) peak in \u039b+\nwhich is wellc \u03c0\ndescribed by a relativistic D-wave Breit-Wigner with mass\n2846 \u00b1 8 MeV/c2 and width 86+33\n\u221222 MeV, as illustrated in\nFig. 1. This region of the Dalitz plot is populated in the\nBelle data, but it is not clear whether a significant structure\nwith the same parameters is present. The closest known\nresonance is the \u03a3c (2800)0 [9]: the widths are consistent\nbut the mass obtained by BABAR differs from the nominal value, 2802 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 7 MeV/c2 , by around three standard\ndeviations. This difference is intriguing but not conclusive.\nAn updated study by Belle with their large \u03a5(4S) dataset\ncould settle this question and establish whether BABAR\nsaw the \u03a3c (2800)0 with a downward fluctuation in mass or\nan entirely new state.\nBABAR also used the large B \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)0 p\u0304 signal to\ndetermine the spin of the \u03a3c (2455)0 ; the state is predicted\nto have J P = 1/2+ in the quark model but neither quantum\nnumber has been measured. BABAR performed an angular\nanalysis of the decay under the assumption that J(\u039b+\nc ) =\n\u2217 m.charles1@physics.ox.ac.uk\n\nEvents / ( 0.015 GeV/c2 )\n\n1\n\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n2.9\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\nm \u039bc\u03c0 (GeV/c2)\n\u2212\nFigure 1: The m(\u039b+\nc \u03c0 ) invariant mass distribution from\n+\n\u2212\nB \u2192 \u039bc p\u0304\u03c0 data at BABAR, using a likelihood weighting technique to suppress background.

Belle has also observed the \u039ec (2980) in the final\nstates \u039ec (2645)0 \u03c0 + and \u039ec (2645)+\u03c0 \u2212 in a separate study\nof 414 fb\u22121 of data [12].

In the discovery mode, \u039b+\nc K\u03c0, the state is close to\nthe kinematic threshold of 2920 MeV/c2 -and as noted by\nBABAR, approximately half of the \u039b+\nc K\u03c0 decays proceed\nvia an intermediate \u03a3c (2455), for which the threshold is at\n2950 MeV/c2 . The fit is therefore sensitive to the details\nof the assumptions made about the signal lineshape, the\nfraction of decays proceeding via a \u03a3c (2455), and the behaviour of the background near threshold; this led to mildly\ninconsistent results for the mass and width from Belle and\nBABAR. The final state \u039ec (2645)\u03c0, reported by Belle and\nshown in Fig. 3, is well above threshold and does not suffer\nfrom these complications; it also has a much lower background rate and does not require reconstruction of a KS for\neither isospin partner.\nThe narrow \u039ec (3077) resonances are also wellestablished: both isospin states have been seen clearly by\nBelle and BABAR, and there is good agreement about the\nmasses and widths. BABAR has shown that most (if not\nall) of the decay proceeds via the quasi-two-body processes\n\nFigure 3:\nInvariant mass distributions for (a)\n\u039ec (2645)0\u03c0 + , and (b) \u039ec (2645)+\u03c0 \u2212 .

From [13].\n\n\u03a9c states\nThe weakly-decaying \u03a90c ground state has been established for more than a decade [6], but until recently its\nproperties had only been measured with a handful of\nevents. Both BABAR and Belle have now published studies with large statistics, confirming and expanding upon\nprevious results. BABAR has reported the first observation of \u03a90c production in B meson decays with an inclusive\nmethod, as shown in Fig. 5, along with measurements of ratios of branching fractions with much improved precision\nin 231 fb\u22121 of data [15]. In addition, Belle has made a new\nmeasurement of the \u03a90c mass with 673 fb\u22121 of data [16],\n2\nobtaining m(\u03a90c ) = 2693.6 \u00b1 0.3+1.8\n\u22121.5 MeV/c .\n\nFigure 5: The inclusive\u221a momentum spectrum of \u03a90c\nbaryons in e+ e\u2212 data at s \u2248 10.6 GeV/c. The data\nshow two peaks: the one at higher momentum is due to\n\u03a90c production in continuum events, and the one at lower\nmomentum is due to the decays of B mesons. The histogram shows the Bowler fragmentation function, fit to the\ndata above 2 GeV/c. From [15].\nThe quark model predicts two \u03a90c ground states: a lowermass octet state with J P = 1/2+ and a higher-mass decuplet state with J P = 3/2+ . This higher-mass partner\nwas observed by BABAR[17] and confirmed by Belle [16]\n(Fig. 6); this completes the experimental discoveries of all\nC = 1 ground states predicted by the quark model. The\nmass splitting between the two \u03a9c partner states \u2206M is\nmeasured to be:\nBABAR: \u2206M = 70.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 1.1 MeV/c2\n2\nBelle: \u2206M = 70.7 \u00b1 0.9+0.1\n\u22120.9 MeV/c ,\nwith excellent agreement between the two experiments.\nSince \u2206M is less than the pion mass, there is no allowed\nstrong decay for the heavier partner state and it therefore\ndecays electromagnetically to \u03a90c \u03b3.\nFrom the constituent quark model [18], we would expect\nother octet-decuplet mass splittings, m(\u039ec (2645))\u2212m(\u039e\u2032c )\nand m(\u03a3c (2520)) \u2212 m(\u03a3c (2455)), to be comparable to\nthe \u03a9c splitting but with some variation due to broken\nSU (3) symmetry entering via the spin-spin coupling term.\nIt is interesting just how small the variation is; averaging\nover the isospin states and assuming the uncertainties to be\nsystematics-dominated, the current data give: [6]\nm(\u039ec (2645)) \u2212 m(\u039e\u2032c ) \u2248\n\nm(\u03a3c (2520)) \u2212 m(\u03a3c (2455)) \u2248\n\n69.5 \u00b1 3 MeV/c2\n\n64.3 \u00b1 0.5 MeV/c2 .\n\nProduction of charmed baryons\nThe production of baryons in e+ e\u2212 interactions and\nmeson decay is still a subject of active study.

From [17]\nand [16].\n\nTwo-body B decays to baryons\nIt has been known for many years that B mesons decay to baryons at a significant rate, with a branching\nfraction of approximately 7% [19]. However, individual\ndecay modes-especially two-body and quasi-two-body\nmodes-have been challenging to observe. The reason for\nthis is two-fold. First, the branching fractions are often (but\n0\nnot always) small, e.g. B(B \u2192 \u039b+\nc p\u0304) = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7\n0\n10\u22125 , and B(B \u2192 pp\u0304) < 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 at the 90% confidence limit [6]. Second, non-CKM-suppressed decays involve a charmed particle which must be reconstructed, implying another factor of O(few%) in the yield due to the\ncharm branching fraction.\nOne notable exception to the first point is B \u2212 \u2192 \u039e0c \u039b\u0304\u2212\nc ,\nwhich was observed by Belle in an analysis of 386 \u00d7 106\n\u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB decays [20] (along with evidence for its\nisospin partner mode B \u2212 \u2192 \u039e0c \u039b\u0304\u2212\nc ) and confirmed by\nBABAR with a sample of 230 \u00d7 106 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB decays [13]. They obtained the following values for B(B \u2212 \u2192\n0\n\u2212 +\n\u039e0c \u039b\u0304\u2212\nc ) \u00d7 B(\u039ec \u2192 \u039e \u03c0 ):\n\u22125\nBelle:\n(4.8+1.0\n\u22120.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10\nBABAR: (2.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nThe value of B(\u039e0c \u2192 \u039e\u2212 \u03c0 + ) has not been measured\n\nOne explanation for this pattern is that producing a\nbaryon-antibaryon pair with large energy release (i.e.\nwhere the baryon and antibaryon have large relative velocity) is kinematically suppressed, since such a reaction\nrequires two hard gluons [22, 23]. This turns the usual\nintuition on its head: processes with a larger phase space\nhave smaller rates. A corollary is that for three-body (or,\nin general, multi-body) baryonic B decays with a large\nenergy release, the bulk of the Dalitz plane is kinematically suppressed-but not the region close to the baryonantibaryon threshold. This implies a kinematic enhancement near the threshold.\nThreshold peaks have been seen in a number of baryonic B decays (some illustrated in Fig. 7) including B \u2212 \u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u039b+\n\u2192 pp\u0304\u03c0 \u2212 , B \u2212 \u2192 pp\u0304K \u2212 , B \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b\u0304K \u2212 ,\nc p\u0304\u03c0 , B\n\u2212\nB \u2192 \u039bp\u0304\u03b3, and B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u0304\u03c0 \u2212 [7, 24, 25, 26], as well as\nin other decays such as J/\u03c8 \u2192 p\u039b\u0304K \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u0304\u03b3\n[27, 28], so there does appear to be a general pattern. However, there are other mechanisms which can also cause a\nthreshold peak-most obviously a resonance at or just below the threshold, but also other effects such as final-state\ninteractions [29, 30, 31]-so the nature of the structure\nin a particular mode may be more complicated than this.\nThere are also modes where no threshold peak is seen even\n0\nthough it might be expected, e.g. B \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)++ p\u0304\u03c0 \u2212\n0\nand B \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)0 p\u0304\u03c0 + [32] and J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u0304\u03c0 0 [28].\nThe former is illustrated in Fig. 8; the Dalitz plot for\n0\nB \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)0 p\u0304\u03c0 + in particular is strikingly empty\nclose to the baryon-antibaryon threshold.\n\nBaryon formation in the continuum\nEnhanced rates near a baryon-antibaryon threshold have\nalso been seen in e+ e\u2212 events with an initial-state radiation\n(ISR) photon. BABAR has measured the effective form\n0\n0\nfactors for pp\u0304, \u039b\u039b\u0304, \u03a30 \u03a3 , and \u039b\u03a3 close to threshold [33,\n34]; the distributions are shown in Fig. 9. In each case we\nsee a strong enhancement at or close to threshold.\nIn the charm sector, Belle has recently reported a\n\u2212\nlarge structure in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039b\u0304c \u03b3ISR events, shown in\nFig. 10 [35]. They note that the nature of the enhancement\nis unclear, but that it can be described by an S-wave rel+5\n2\nativistic Breit-Wigner with mass 4634+8\n\u22127 \u22128 MeV/c and\n+40 +10\nwidth 92\u221224 \u221221 MeV. It seems quite plausible that this is\none of the many charmonium and charmonium-like states\nabove the DD threshold [6]. In particular, it may be the\nY (4660) seen previously in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 (J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b3ISR\nevents [36] with mass 4664 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 5 MeV/c2 and width\n48\u00b115\u00b13 MeV; the modest discrepancy in parameters be-\n\n\fM2(p \u03c0-) (GeV2/c 4)\n\n|A|2 / (0.017 GeV/c2)\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n\n(a)\n(c)\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n20\n\n2\n\n10\n0\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n4.0\n\n4.2\n\n4.4\n\n0 10\n\n4.6\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n2 4\nM2(\u03a3++\nc p) (GeV /c )\n\n2\n\n6\n\nM2(p \u03c0+) (GeV2/c 4)\n\ndBF / dMpp_ ( 10\u22126 / (GeV/c2))\n\nm \u039b c p (GeV/c )\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n(c)\n(a)\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\n0 10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\nM2(\u03a30c p) (GeV2/c 4)\n\n0\n2.5\n\n3\n\nMpp_\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n0\n\nFigure 8: Dalitz plots for B \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)++ p\u0304\u03c0 \u2212 (upper)\n0\nand B \u2192 \u03a3c (2455)0 p\u0304\u03c0 + (lower).

Errors shown\nare statistical only. 695 fb\u22121 of data were used. From [35].\n\ntween the two measurements may be due to differing form\nfactors for the two final states [37].\nThe kinematic favourability of forming baryonantibaryon pairs with small relative velocity is certainly\nnot a new discovery or unique to low-energy interactions;\nit was noted at LEP-I, for example, that correlated pp\u0304, \u039b\u039b\u0304,\nand \u039bp\u0304 pairs peak at small values of the rapidity difference\n|\u2206y| [38, 39] and are predominantly produced in the same\njet.\nThis is not universally true, however. In 13.6 fb\u22121 of\n\nCLEO ruled out the first class as the sole source of the\nevents observed, since the rate was approximately 3.5 times\nhigher than would be expected given independent fragmentation. Qualitatively, they looked for additional protons in\nthe event and did not find signal; this disfavours the second\nclass (since those events have two additional light baryons)\nbut does not exclude it.\nBABAR has made a preliminary study of this process\n\u2212\nwith 220 fb\u22121 of data [41]. They see an excess of \u039b+\nc \u039b\u0304c\nevents by a factor of 4, confirming the CLEO observation. In addition, they find that most of the events seen\nhave zero additional identified protons, such that the rate\nseen is consistent with that expected from material interactions and from misidentification of other charged particles\n(Fig. 12(a)). Further, when plotting the missing mass distribution of the event (after subtracting the momenta of the\n\u2212\n\u039b+\nc , \u039b\u0304c , and any reconstructed tracks), they find that most\nevents have well below 2 GeV/c2 of missing mass, and are\ntherefore inconsistent with containing a baryon and an antibaryon that are not reconstructed or are misidentified as\npions (Fig. 12(b)). While some contribution from classes\n(1) and (2) is not ruled out, this implies that class (3) is the\ndominant effect.\n\nConclusions\nThere has been a great deal of progress in charmed\nbaryon spectroscopy recently, and the high statistics of\nBelle and BABAR are still uncovering new states.

We look forward to further experimental data and to input from phenomenology to help understand these structures.\n\n[23] H.Y. Cheng, Int. J. Mod. Phys.
