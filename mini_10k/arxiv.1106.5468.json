Basil patiently explained to me the subtleties of the\ncausal interpretation of quantum mechanics and of the Implicate Order; our\nconversations were invariably accompanied by a cup of strong Assam tea,\nhis favourite beverage (during daytime, that is; later at night we occasionally replaced the cup of tea by a glass of a beverage known in France as\nPastis). Of course, I already had read a lot about the causal interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, but my knowledge and understanding of this theory\nwas merely on an abstract mathematical level. Thanks to Basil's pedagogical\nskills Physics now entered the scene and helped me to understand some of\nthe deep implications of the causal interpretation. However, Basil also was\na patient and empathetic listener, always eager to hear about new developments in mathematics (Basil is not only a brilliant physicist, he also has\nan excellent taste for mathematics). When I explained to him my ideas on\nthe uncertainty principle and introduced him to the \"symplectic camel\" and\n\"quantum blobs\", he immediately became very enthusiastic and encouraged\nme to pursue the approach I had initiated in some recent papers. He was\neven kind enough to honour me by writing a foreword to my book [10] where\nI explained some of these ideas. Therefore I could do no less than to write\nthis modest contribution to the \"Hiley Festschrift\" as a tribute to my friend\nBasil for his Helsinki birthday party!\n\nContents\nIn this paper I establish a fundamental correspondence of a geometric nature\nbetween the squeezed coherent states familiar from quantum optics, and\nquantum blobs. The latter are related the principle of the symplectic camel,\nwhich is a deep topological property of canonical transformations, and allow\na \"coarse graining\" of phase space\u221ain units which are symplectic deformations\nof phase space balls with radius ~.\nThis paper is structured as follows. I begin by reviewing in Sect. 1 the\nmain definitions and properties of squeezed coherent states; In Sect. 2 I introduce the notion of quantum blob which we discuss from a purely geometric\npoint of view. In Sect. 3 the fundamental correspondence between squeezed\ncoherent states and quantum blobs is established; this correspondence which\nis denoted by G is bijective (that is one-to-one and onto); its definition is\n2\n\n\fmade possible using the theory of the Wigner transform of Gaussian functions. In Sect. 4 I prove the fundamental statistical property of quantum\nblobs: they are a geometric picture of minimum uncertainty. Finally, in\nSect. 5, I shortly discuss the relationship between quantum blobs and a certain level set introduced in 1930 by Enrico Fermi and which seems to have\nbeen almost unnoticed in the Scientific literature. The paper ends with some\nconjectures and a discussion of related topics I plan to develop in further\nwork.\n\nNotation\nn\nn\nThe phase space R2n\nz \u2261 Rx \u2295 Rp (n \u2265 1) is equipped with the standard\nsymplectic form \u03c3(z, z \u2032 ) = p * x\u2032 \u2212 p\u2032 * x if z = (x, p), z \u2032 = (x\u2032 , p\u2032 ). We are\nwriting x = (x1 , ..., xn ), p = (p1 , ..., pn ), and p * x = p1 x1 + * * * + pn xn is the\nusual Euclidean\nscalar product\nof p and x. Equivalently \u03c3(z, z \u2032 ) = Jz * z \u2032\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0n\u00d7n In\u00d7n\nwhere J =\nis the standard symplectic matrix. The group of\n\u2212In\u00d7n 0n\u00d7n\nlinear automorphisms of R2n\nz is denoted by Sp(2n, R) and called the standard\nsymplectic group. We have S \u2208 Sp(2n, R) if and only if S is a linear mapping\n2n\nT\nR2n\nz \u2212\u2192 Rz such that S JS = J.\n\nAcknowledgement 1 This work has been supported by the Austrian Research Agency FWF (Projektnummer P20442-N13).\n\n1\n\nSqueezed Coherent States\n\nFor details and complements see the seminal paper by Littlejohn [26]; Folland\n[8] also contains valuable information.\nThe archetypical example is that of the fiducial (or standard, or vacuum)\ncoherent state\n2\n\u03a6~ (x) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n/4 e\u2212|x| /2~\n(1)\nwhere the factor (\u03c0~)\u2212n/4 is introduced in order to ensure normalization. It\nwas first systematically used by Schr\u00f6dinger in 1926. The notation \u03a6~ (x) =\nhx|0i is also widely used in quantum mechanics. It represents the ground\nstate of the isotropic harmonic oscillator; alternatively it is an eigenstate of\nthe annihilation operator with eigenvalue zero. More generally one wants to\n\n3\n\n\fconsider Gaussians of the type\n1\n\n\u03a6~X,Y (x) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n/4 (det X)1/4 e\u2212 2~ (X+iY )x*x\n\n(2)\n\nwhere X and Y are real symmetric n \u00d7 n matrices, X positive definite; we\nhave ||\u03a6~X,Y ||L2 = 1. The Gaussian (2) is called a squeezed (or generalized)\ncoherent state. Let Tb~ (z0 ) be the Heisenberg\u2013Weyl operator defined for a\nfunction \u03a8 \u2208 L2 (Rn ) by\n1\n\ni\nTb~ (z0 )\u03c8(x) = e ~ (p0 *x\u2212 2 p0 *x0 ) \u03c8(x \u2212 x0 ).\n\n(3)\n\nWe can still go one step further and define the shifted squeezed coherent\nstate\n\u03a6~X,Y,z0 (x) = Tb~ (z0 )\u03a6~X,Y (x)\n(4)\nwhere Tb~ (z0 ) is the Heisenberg\u2013Weyl operator: if \u03a8 is a function on configuration space Rnx then\n1\ni\nTb~ (z0 )\u03a8(x) = e ~ (p0 *x\u2212 2 p0 *x0 ) \u03a8(x \u2212 x0 ).\n\n(5)\n\nWe will write from now on\n\nM = X + iY , \u03a6~M = \u03a6~X,Y , \u03a6~M,z0 = Tb~ (z0 )\u03a6~M .\n\n(6)\n\nThe important thing is that squeezed coherent states are naturally obtained from the fiducial state (1) by letting metaplectic operators act on it.\nLet us explain this property shortly; for details see for instance de Gosson\n[15]. The symplectic group Sp(2n, R) has a covering group of order two, the\nmetaplectic group Mp(2n, R). That group consists of unitary operators (the\nmetaplectic operators) acting on L2 (Rn ). There are several equivalent ways\nto describe the metaplectic operators. For our purposes the most tractable\nis the following: assume that S \u2208 Sp(2n, R) has the block-matrix form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA B\nwith det B 6= 0.\n(7)\nS=\nC D\nThe condition det B 6= 0 is not very restrictive, because one shows (de Gosson [10, 15]) that every S \u2208 Sp(2n, R) can be written (non uniquely however)\nas the product of two symplectic matrices of the type above; moreover the\nsymplectic matrices arising as Jacobian matrices of Hamiltonian flows determined by physical Hamiltonians of the type \"kinetic energy plus potential\"\nare of this type for almost every time t. To the matrix (7) we associate the\nfollowing quantities:\n4\n\n\f\u2022 A quadratic form\n1\n1\nW (x, x\u2032 ) = DB \u22121 x * x \u2212 B \u22121 x * x\u2032 + B \u22121 Ax\u2032 * x\u2032\n2\n2\ndefined on the double configuration space Rnx \u00d7 Rnx ; the matrices DB \u22121\nand B \u22121 A are symmetric because S is symplectic (W (x, x\u2032 ) is often\ncalled \"Hamilton's characteristic function\" Goldstein [9]) in mechanics,\nor \"eikonal\" in optics; it is closely related to the notion of action de\nGosson [10, 15]);\np\n\u2022 The complex number \u2206(W ) = im | det B \u22121 | where m (\"Maslov index\") is chosen in the following way: m = 0 or 2 if det B \u22121 > 0 and\nm = 1 or 3 if det B \u22121 < 0.\nThe two metaplectic operators associated to S are then given by\nZ\n\u0001\ni\n\u2032\n1 n/2\nb\nS\u03a8(x) = 2\u03c0i\n\u2206(W ) e ~ W (x,x ) \u03a8(x\u2032 )dn x\u2032 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe fact that we have two possible choices for the Maslov index shows that\nb this of course is just a reflection\nthe metaplectic operators occur in pairs \u00b1S;\nof the fact that Mp(2n, R) is a two-fold covering group of Sp(2n, R).\nThe action of Mp(2n, R) on squeezed coherent states is given by the\nfollowing result:\nProposition 2 Let Sb \u2208 Mp(2n, R) be one of\u0012the two\n\u0013 metaplectic operators\nA B\n(we do not make the\ncorresponding to the symplectic matrix S =\nC D\nassumption det B 6= 0). Then\nb\nb ~ = e ~i \u03b3(S)\nS\u03a6\n\u03a6~MS with MS = i(AM + iB)(CM + iD)\u22121\nM\n\n(9)\n\nb = \u03b3(S)\nb + i\u03c0~ [ the matrix\nwhere e ~ \u03b3(S) is a phase factor such that \u03b3(\u2212S)\nCM + iD is never singular]. More generally we have:\ni\n\nb\n\nb\nb ~M,z = e ~i \u03b3(S)\n\u03a6~MS ,Sz0 .\nS\u03a6\n0\n\nProof. See Folland [8], Littlejohn [26].\nThis important result motivates the following definition:\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fDefinition 3 The set CS(n, R) of all squeezed coherent states consists of all\ni\n{e ~ \u03b3 \u03a6~M,z0 } where \u03b3 is an arbitrary real phase.\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2032\n\nWe thus do not distinguish between e ~ \u03b3 \u03a6~M,z0 and e ~ \u03b3 \u03a6~M,z0 ; we will often\ni\nomit the prefactor e ~ \u03b3 . Proposition 2 can now be restated in terms of a group\naction:\nMp(2n, R) \u00d7 CS(n, R) \u2212\u2192 CS(n, R)\ni\n\ni\n\nb\n\nb e ~ \u03b3 \u03a6~ ) 7\u2212\u2192 e ~ (\u03b3+\u03b3(S)) \u03a6~ .\n(S,\nM\nMS\n\nWe will come back to this action in a moment and give a geometric picture\nof it in terms of phase space ellipsoids.\nAn important property of Proposition 2 above is that CS(n, R) is preserved by Hamiltonian flows arising from quadratic Hamiltonian functions,\ni.e. Hamiltonians of the general type\n1\nH(z) = Rz * z\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere R is a real symmetric matrix. When H is of the physical type \"kinetic energy plus potential\" this amounts considering potentials which are\nquadratic forms 12 \u03a9x * x in the position variables (generalized harmonic oscillator):\n1\n1\n|p|2 + \u03a9x * x.\n(12)\nH(z) =\n2m\n2\nFor Hamiltonians of the type (11) the flow determined by the Hamilton\nequations\n\u1e8b = \u2207p H(x, p) , \u1e57 = \u2212\u2207x H(x, p)\n(13)\nconsists of linear canonical transformations (Arnol'd [1], Goldstein [9], de\nGosson [15]). In fact, rewriting these equations in the form \u017c = JXz with\nX = \u2212JR the explicit solution is given by zt = (xt , pt ) = etX z0 . The\nmatrix X belongs to the symplectic Lie algebra sp(2n, R) (because XJ +\nJX T = 0, see Folland [8] or de Gosson [10, 15]) hence the matrices St = etX\nare symplectic. For instance, for the generalized harmonic oscillator (12)\nthe Hamilton\n\u0012\n\u0013 equations are \u1e8b = p/m and \u1e57 = \u2212\u03a9x and we have X =\n0 1/m\n.\n\u2212\u03a9\n0\nIt follows from the theory of the metaplectic group that together with the\ntheory of covering spaces (see e.g. Folland [8], de Gosson [15]) that to the path\n6\n\n\ft 7\u2212\u2192 St = etX of symplectic matrices corresponds a unique path t 7\u2212\u2192 Sbt\nof metaplectic operators such that Sb0 is the identity.

Besides the fact that they allow a geometric description\nof the uncertainty principle [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] (of which the reader will find\na precise description in next subsection), we are going to see that they are\nintimately related to the notion of squeezed coherent states, of which it can\nbe considered as a phase space geometric picture.\nBy definition, a quantum blob is a subset QB 2n =\u221aQB 2n (z0 , S) of R2n\nz\nwhich can be deformed into the phase space ball B 2n ( ~) : |z| \u2264 ~ using\nonly translations and linear canonical transformations\nS \u2208 Sp(2n, R). Equiv\u221a\n2n\n2n\nalently, QB is an ellipsoid obtained from B ( ~) by an affine symplectic\ntransformation. More precisely:\n\u221a\n2n\n2n\nDefinition 4 Let S \u2208 Sp(2n, R) and z0 \u2208 R2n\nz . Then QB (z0 , S) = T (z0 )SB ( ~)\nwhere T (z0 ) is the translation operator z 7\u2212\u2192 z + z0 . Equivalently, it is the\nset\nQB 2n (z0 , S) = {z : (S \u22121 )T S \u22121 (z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2264 ~}\n\nwhere we are writing (S \u22121 )T S \u22121 (z \u2212 z0 )2 for (S \u22121 )T S \u22121 (z \u2212 z0 )2 . The set of\nall quantum blobs in phase space R2n\nz is denoted QB(2n, R).\nOne shows (de Gosson [15], de Gosson and Luef [19]) that a quantum\nblob QB2n (z0 , S) is characterized by the two following equivalent properties:\n\n\u2022 The intersection of the ellipsoid QB 2n (z0 , S) with a plane passing through\nz0 and parallel to any of the plane of canonically\n\u221a 2 1 conjugate coordinates\nxj , pj in R2n\nis\nan\nellipse\nwith\narea\n\u03c0(\n~) = 2 h; that area is called the\nz\nsymplectic capacity of the quantum blob QB 2n (z0 , S) (we will discuss\nmore in detail this notion in a moment);\n\u221a\n\u2022 The supremum of the set of all numbers \u03c0R2 such that the ball B 2n ( R) :\n2n\n|z| \u2264 R can be embedded into\n(z0 , S) using canonical transforma\u221a QB\n2\ntions (linear,\nor not) is \u03c0( ~) . Hence no phase space ball with radius\n\u221a\nR > ~ can be \"squeezed\" inside QB 2n (z0 , S) using only canonical\ntransformations (Gromov's non-squeezing theorem [20], alias the principle of the symplectic camel).\n\n8\n\n\fIt turns out (de Gosson [15]) that in the first of these conditions one can\nreplace the plane of conjugate coordinates with any symplectic plane (a symplectic plane is a two-dimensional subspace of R2n\nz on which the restriction\nof the symplectic form \u03c3 is again a symplectic form).\nClearly there is a natural action\nSp(2n, R) \u00d7 QB(2n, R) \u2212\u2192 QB(2n, R)\n(S, QB2n (z0 , S)) 7\u2212\u2192 S[QB2n (z0 , S)]\n\nof symplectic matrices on quantum blobs: for S \u2032 \u2208 Sp(2n, R) we have S \u2032 T (z0 ) =\nT (S \u2032\u22121 z0 )S \u2032 and hence\n\u221a\nS \u2032 [QB 2n (z0 , S)] = T (S \u2032\u22121 z0 )S \u2032 SB 2n ( ~) = QB 2n (z0 , S \u2032 S).\n(20)\nConversely:\nProposition 5 Let G \u2208 Sp(2n, R) be positive-definite and symmetric. The\nset {z : G(z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2264 ~} is a quantum blob QB 2n (z0 , S).\nProof. As a consequence of the symplectic polar decomposition theorem (see\ne.g. de Gosson [15]) there exists S \u2208 Sp(2n, R) such that G = (S \u22121 )T S \u22121\nhence the condition G(z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2264 ~ is equivalent to (S \u22121 )T S \u22121 (z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2264 ~.\nThe symplectic matrix S defining a given quantum blob is not unique;\none shows (see de Gosson [15]) that QB 2n (z0 , S) = QB 2n (z0 , S \u2032 ) if and only\nif S \u2032 = SU where U is a symplectic rotation, i.e. an element of the subgroup\nU(n) = Sp(2n, R) \u2229 O(2n, R) of the symplectic group. This property reflects\nthe invariance of phase space balls centered at the origin under rotations. A\nconsequence of this fact is that we have the following topological identification\n(de Gosson [14]):\nQB(2n, R) \u2261 Rn(n+1) \u00d7 R2n \u2261 Rn(n+3) .\nThus, if we view QB(2n, R) as a \"quantum phase space\" its topological\ndimension n(n + 3) is much larger than that, 2n, of the classical phase space,\neven when n = 1 (in the latter case dim QB(2, R) = 3, which is easily\nunderstood as follows: one need one parameter to specify the centre of the\nquantum blob (which is here an ellipse with area h/2), one to specify one of\nthe principal axes, and another to describe the angle of a principal axe with,\nsay, the x-axis. A similar interpretation applies in higher dimensions.\n9\n\n\fLet us briefly compare quantum blobs to the usual quantum cells from\nstatistical\u221amechanics. A quantum cell is typically a phase space cube with\nvolume ( h)2n = h. The first obvious remark is that these cells do not\nhave any symmetry under general symplectic transformations; while such a\ntransformation preserves volume, a cube will in general be distorted into a\nmultidimensional polyhedron. But what is more striking is the comparison\n\u221a\nof volumes. Since a quantum blob is obtained from the ball B 2n ( ~) by a\nvolume-preserving transformation its volume is given by\n\u0001\nhn\nVol QB 2n (z0 , S) =\nn!2n\nand is hence n!2n smaller than that of a quantum cell. For instance, in\nthe case of the physical three-dimensional configuration space this leads to\na factor of 48. In the case of a macroscopic system with n = 1023 this fact\nbecomes unimaginably large. This is in strong contrast with the fact that\nthe orthogonal projection of a quantum blob on any plane xj , pj of conjugate\ncoordinates (or, more generally, on any symplectic plane) is an ellipse with\narea equal to \u03c0~ = h/2.\n\n3\n\nThe Correspondence G\n\nRecall that the Wigner transform of a pure state \u03a8 is given by\nZ\n\u0001\ni\n1 n\ne\u2212 ~ p*y \u03a8(x + 21 y)\u03a8\u2217(x \u2212 21 y)dn y\nW \u03a8(z) = 2\u03c0~\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the star \u2217 denotes complex conjugation.\nThe Wigner transform of the fiducial coherent state \u03a6~ is given by\n1\n\n2\n\nW \u03a6~ (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ |z| . .\nMore generally [15, 26] the Wigner transform\nZ\n\u0001\ni\n~\n1 n\ne\u2212 ~ p*y \u03a6~M (x + 12 y)\u03a6~M (x \u2212 21 y)\u2217 dn y\nW \u03a6M (z) = 2\u03c0~\n\n(22)\n\nof the squeezed coherent state \u03a6~M = \u03a6~X,Y is given by the formula:\n1\n\nW \u03a6~M (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ Gz*z\n10\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere G is the real 2n \u00d7 2n matrix\n\u0012\nX + Y X \u22121 Y\nG=\nX \u22121 Y\n\n\u0013\nY X \u22121\n.\nX \u22121\n\n(24)\n\nNotice that G does not contain the parameter ~. It turns out that G is both\npositive definite and symplectic; in fact G = S T S where\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX 1/2\n0\n\u2208 Sp(2n, R).\n(25)\nS=\nX \u22121/2 Y X \u22121/2\nThe same analysis applies to \u03a6~M,z0 (z0 ). Letting the translation operator\nT (z0 ) : z 7\u2212\u2192 z + z0 act on functions on phase space by the rule T (z0 )f (z) =\nf (z \u2212 z0 ) and its quantum variant, the Heisenberg\u2013Weyl operator (26) we\nhave the translational property\nW (Tb~ (z0 )\u03c8)(z) = T (z0 )W (\u03c8)(z)\n\n(26)\n\nand hence, in particular\n\n1\n\n2\n\nW \u03a6~M,z0 (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ G(z\u2212z0 ) .\n\n(27)\n\nLet us now state and prove the following essential correspondence result\nwhich identifies squeezed coherent states with quantum blobs:\nProposition 6 There is a bijective correspondence\nG : CS(n, R) \u2190\u2192 QB(2n, R)\nbetween coherent states and quantum blobs. That correspondence is defined\nas follows: if\n1\n2\nW \u03a6~M,z0 (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ G(z\u2212z0 )\nthen we have\nG[\u03a6~M,z0 ] = {z : G(z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2264 ~} = QB 2n (z0 , S \u22121 )\nwhere the symplectic matrix S is given by formula (25) above.\n\n11\n\n(28)\n\n\fProof. While the definition of the correspondence G is straightforward, it is\nnot immediately clear why it should be bijective. Let us first show that it is\none-to-one. Suppose that G[\u03a6~M,z0 ] = G[\u03a6~M \u2032 ,z \u2032 ], that is\n0\n\n2\n\n{z : G(z \u2212 z0 ) \u2264 ~} = {z : G\u2032 (z \u2212 z0\u2032 )2 \u2264 ~}.\n\nWe must then have G = G\u2032 and z0 = z0\u2032 so that W \u03a6~M,z0 (z) = W \u03a6~M \u2032 ,z \u2032 (z);\n0\nsince the Wigner transform of a function \u03a8 determines uniquely determines\ni\n\u03a8 up to a unimodular factor we have \u03a6~M \u2032 ,z \u2032 = e ~ \u03b3 \u03a6~M,z0 for some real phase \u03b3.\n0\nLet us next show that G is onto; this will at the same time yield a procedure\n\u221a\nfor calculating the inverse of G. Assume that QB2n (0, S \u22121) = S \u22121 B 2n ( ~)\nis a quantum blob centered at the origin. One can factorize the matrix S \u22121\nas follows (\"pre-Iwasawa factorization\"; cf. [15], \u00a72.2, Corollary 2.30):\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nA \u2212B\nL 0\n\u22121\nS =\nB A\nQ L\u22121\nwhere the symmetric matrix L is given by\nL = (D T D + B T B)1/2\n\n(29)\n\nis symmetric positive definite,\nQ = \u2212(C T D + AT B)(D T D + B T B)\u22121/2\n(30)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA \u2212B\nis thus a symplectic rotation\nwith A + iB \u2208 U(n, C). The matrix\nB A\nand, as such, leaves any ball centered at the origin invariant. Setting X 1/2 =\nL and Y = X 1/2 Q it follows that we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\n\u221a i\n\u221a\nX 1/2\n0\n2n\n\u22121\n2n\nB ( ~) =\nS\n\u22121/2\n\u22121/2 B ( ~);\nX\nY X\nthe quantum blob QB 2n (0, S \u22121 ) is thus represented by Gz * z \u2264 ~ where\nG = S T S is of the type (24); define now \u03a6~M = \u03a6~X,Y by assigning to X\nand Y the values L2 and X 1/2 Q found above. The argument generalizes in\na straightforward way to quantum blobs with arbitrary centre.\nIn view of the correspondence between squeezed coherent states and quantum blobs, we can give a phase space picture of formula (17) for the time\nevolution of a squeezed coherent state when the Hamiltonian function is\nquadratic. Let us study this deformation in some detail.\nWe claim that an initial quantum blob becomes after time t a new quantum blob which is just its image by the classical flow St :\n12\n\n\fProposition 7 After time t the initial quantum blob QB 2n (z0 , S0 ) becomes\nthe quantum blob\nSt [QB2n (z0 , S0 )] = QB 2n (zt , S0 St ).\nThus, the quantum motion of coherent states induces the classical motion for\nthe corresponding quantum blob.\nProof. At initial time we are in presence of an initial quantum blob QB 2n (z0 , S),\nset of all phase space points z such that G(z \u2212 z0 )(z \u2212 z0 ) \u2264 ~ with G =\n(S \u22121 )T S \u22121 .

Using formula (16))\ntogether with the symplectic covariance of the Wigner transform (de Gosson\n[15]) we have\nW \u03a8(z, t) = W (Sbt \u03a6~M0 ,z0 )(z) = W \u03a6~M0 ,z0 (St\u22121 z).\n\nthat is, in view of formula (23) giving the Wigner transform of \u03a6~M0 ,z0 :\n\u0015\n1 \u22121 T\n\u22121\n2\nW \u03a8(z, t) = (\u03c0~) exp \u2212 (St ) G0 (St z \u2212 z0 ) .\n~\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u22121 T\n\u2212n\n\u22121\n2\n= (\u03c0~) exp \u2212 (St ) G0 St (z \u2212 zt ) .\n~\n\u2212n\n\n\u0014\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nIt follows that the initial quantum blob has become the ellipsoid defined by\n(St\u22121 )T G0 St\u22121 (z \u2212 zt )2 \u2264 ~\nwhich proves our claim.\n\n4\n\nStatistical Interpretation of G\n\nWe begin by recalling the notion of symplectic capacity, which was already\nmentioned briefly in the beginning of this paper after the definition of quantum blobs. See Hofer\u2013Zehnder [25], Polterovich [29], or de Gosson [16] and\n13\n\n\fde Gosson and Luef [19] for a review of this notion from point of view easily\naccessible to physicists.\nA symplectic capacity on phase space R2n\nz assigns to every subset \u03a9 of\n2n\nRz a number c(\u03a9) \u2265 0, or +\u221e. This assignment must obey the following\nrules:\n(SC1) If \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a9\u2032 then c(\u03a9) \u2264 c(\u03a9\u2032 );\n(SC2) If f is a canonical transformation then c(f (\u03a9)) = c(\u03a9);\n(SC3) If \u03bb is a real number then c(\u03bb\u03a9) = \u03bb2 c(\u03a9); here \u03bb\u03a9 is the set of all\npoints \u03bbz when z \u2208 \u03a9;\n(SC4) We have c(B 2n (R)) = \u03c0R2 = c(Zj2n (R)); here B 2n (R) is the ball\n|x|2 + |p|2 \u2264 R2 and Zj2n (R) the cylinder x2j + p2j \u2264 R2 .\nThere exist infinitely many symplectic capacities, however the construction of any of them is notoriously difficult (the fact that symplectic capacities\nexist is actually equivalent to Gromov's non-squeezing theorem [20]). However they all agree on phase space ellipsoids. In fact:\nProposition 8 Let W : Mz * z \u2264 ~ where M is a symmetric positive definite\n2n \u00d7 2n matrix. We have\nc(W) =\u03c0~/\u03bbmax\n\n(34)\n\nfor every symplectic capacity c; here \u03bbmax is the largest symplectic eigenvalue\nof M.\nThe proof of this result is based on a symplectic diagonalisation of M;\nsee de Gosson [15], Hofer\u2013Zehnder [25], Polterovich [29], and the references\ntherein. Recall that the symplectic eigenvalues of M are defined as follows:\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix JM are of the type \u00b1i\u03bbj with \u03bbj > 0; the\nsequence (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) is then the symplectic spectrum of M and the \u03bbj the\nsymplectic eigenvalues.\nThe smallest symplectic capacity is denoted by cmin (\"Gromov width\"):\nby definition cmin (\u03a9) is the supremum of all numbers \u03c0R2 such that there\nexists a canonical transformation such that f (B 2n (R)) \u2282 \u03a9. The fact that\ncmin really is a symplectic capacity follows from Gromov's [20] symplectic nonsqueezing theorem. For a discussion of Gromov's theorem (and comments)\n14\n\n\ffrom the physicist's point of view see de Gosson [16], de Gosson and Luef\n[19].\nLet now K be an arbitrary real symmetric positive-definite matrix of\norder 2n and define the normalized phase space Gaussian\n1\n\nWK (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n/2 (det K)1/2 e\u2212 ~ Kz*z .\nWhen K = G \u2208 Sp(2n, R) the Gaussian WK (z) is the Wigner transform of\nsome squeezed coherent state. Following Littlejohn [26] we define a matrix\n\u03a3 by the relation\n~\n\u03a3 = K \u22121\n(35)\n2\nhence WK (z) takes the familiar form\n1\n\nWK (z) = (2\u03c0)\u2212n (det \u03a3)\u22121/2 e\u2212 2 \u03a3\n\n\u22121 z*z\n\nsuggesting to interpret \u03a3 as the covariance matrix of a normal probability\ndistribution centered at the origin. We will write \u03a3 in block form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206(X, X) \u2206(X, P )\n\u03a3=\n\u2206(P, X) \u2206(P, P )\nwhere each block has dimension n \u00d7 n and \u2206(P, X) = \u2206(X, P )T ; we use the\nnotation\n\u2206(X, X) = (Cov(xj , xk ))1\u2264j,k\u2264n\n\u2206(X, P ) = (Cov(xj , pk ))1\u2264j,k\u2264n\n\u2206(P, P ) = (Cov(pj , pk ))1\u2264j,k\u2264n\nand set\n(\u2206xj )2 = Cov(xj , xj ) , (\u2206pj )2 = Cov(pj , pj )\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. The essential observation we make is:\n\nProposition 9 Consider the phase space ellipsoid W : 21 \u03a3\u22121 z * z \u2264 1.

It is based on the following fact, well-known\nin the quantum optics community: the condition\n\u03a3+\n\ni~\nJ is Hermitian positive semi-definite\n2\n\n(38)\n\nimplies the Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger inequalities (37) (but it is not equivalent\nto it: see de Gosson [16] for a counterexample). Some algebra together with\na formula giving the symplectic capacity of an ellipsoid, then shows that\nconditions (38) and (36) are equivalent. Notice that the matrix \u03a3 + i~2 J is\nalways Hermitian since (\u03a3+ i~2 J)\u2217 = \u03a3\u2212 i~2 J T and J T = \u2212J. We mention that\nsymplectic capacities can be used as well for the study of the more general\nuncertainty principle related to non-commutative quantum mechanics as we\nhave shown in de Gosson [17].\nSuppose now that the covariances defined above correspond to some quantum state \u03a8 (pure or mixed). The Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger inequalities (37)\nare saturated (i.e. they become equalities) exactly when that state is a\nsqueezed coherent state \u03a6~M where M = X +iY is determined via the Wigner\ntransform of \u03a6~M (cf. (35))\n1\n\nW \u03a6~M (z) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ Gz*z , G =\n\n~ \u22121\n\u03a3 .\n2\n\nFor instance if \u03a6~M is the fiducial coherent state \u03a6~ all the covariances vanish\nand the inequalities (37) reduce to \u2206xj \u2206pj = 12 ~ for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\n5\n\nFermi's Function gF\n\nIn a largely forgotten paper from 1930 Fermi [7] associates to every quantum\nstate \u03a8 a certain hypersurface gF (x, p) = 0. Fermi's paper has recently been\nrediscovered by Benenti [2] and Benenti and Strini [3]; in particular these\nauthors give a heuristic comparison of the function gF and the Wigner transform W \u03a8. Let us shortly study the relationship between Fermi's function\nand the notion of quantum blob. The starting point is Fermi's observation\nthat the state of a quantum system may be defined in two different (but\nequivalent) ways, namely by its wavefunction \u03a8 or by measuring a certain\nphysical quantity whose definition goes as follows. Writing the wavefunction\nin polar form \u03a8(x) = R(x)ei\u03a6(x)/\u0127 (R(x) \u2265 0 and \u03a6(x) real) one verifies by\n16\n\n\fa straightforward calculation that \u03a8 is a solution of the partial differential\nequation\ngbF \u03a8 = 0\n(39)\nwhere\n\n\u22072x R\n.\n(40)\nR\nThe equation (39) seems at first sight to be ad hoc and somewhat mysterious.\nHowever much of the mystery disappears if one remarks that this equation\nis obtained by the gauge transform p \u2212\u2192 p \u2212 \u2207x \u03a6 from the trivial equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2 2\n2 \u2207x R\n\u2212~ \u2207x + ~\nR = 0.\n(41)\nR\ngbF = (\u2212i~\u2207x \u2212 \u2207x \u03a6)2 + ~2\n\nConsider now the Weyl symbol of the operator gbF ; it is the real function\ngF (x, p) = (p \u2212 \u2207x \u03a6)2 + ~2\n\n\u22072x R\n.\nR\n\n(42)\n\nWhen \u22072x R/R < 0 the equation gF (x, p) = 0 determines a hypersurface HF\nin phase space R2n\nz which Fermi ultimately identifies with the state \u03a8. Let\nus examine the relation between Fermi's Ansatz and the notion of quantum\nblob we have introduced in this paper. Let \u03a6~M = \u03a6~X,Y be the squeezed\ncoherent state defined by Eqn. (2); we have in this case \u03a6(x) = \u2212 21 Y x * x\nand R(x) = e\u2212Xx*x/2~ hence Fermi's function is\ngF (x, p) = (p + Y x)2 + X 2 x * x \u2212 ~ Tr X\n\n(43)\n\nwhere Tr X is the trace of the matrix X (note that Tr X > 0 since X is\npositive definite). The hypersurface HF is thus the closed hypersurface\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n1\nX +Y2 Y\n.\n(44)\nMF z * z = ~ with MF =\nY\nI\nTr X\nRecall now that the Wigner transform\n1\n(\u03c0~)\u2212n e\u2212 ~ Gz*z where (formulas (24) and\n\u0012\nX + Y X \u22121 Y\nG=\nX \u22121 Y\nand S is the symplectic matrix\n\u0012\nX 1/2\nS=\nX \u22121/2 Y\n17\n\nof \u03a6~M is the function W \u03a6~M (z) =\n(25))\n\u0013\nY X \u22121\n= ST S\n(45)\nX \u22121\n\n0\nX \u22121/2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\n\fAn immediate calculation shows that the matrices MF and G are related by\nthe formula\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nX 0\nT\nMF =\nS.\n(47)\nS\n0 X\nTr X\nLet us consider the \"Fermi ellipsoid\" WF : MF z * z \u2264 ~ bounded by the\nhypersurface HF .\nProposition 10 (i) There exist symplectic coordinates in which the Fermi\nellipsoid WF : MF z * z \u2264 ~ is represented by the inequality\nXx * x + Xp * p \u2264 ~ Tr X\n\n(48)\n\nor by the inequality\nN\nX\n\n\u03bbj (x2j + p2j ) \u2264 ~ Tr X\n\n(49)\n\nwhere \u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn are the eigenvalues of X;\n(ii) We have\n1\n\u03c0 Tr X\n~\u2265 h\nc(WF ) =\n\u03bbmax\n2\nwhere \u03bbmax is the largest eigenvalue of MF and\n\n(50)\n\nj=1\n\n1\nnh\nh \u2264 c(WF ) \u2264\n.\n2\n2\n\n(51)\n\nProof.\n\u0012\n\u0013(i) In view of (47) the inequality MF z * z \u2264 ~ is equivalent to\nX 0\nu*u \u2264 ~ Tr X with u = Sz. Let U be a rotation in Rn diagonalising\n0 X\n\u0012\n\u0013\nU 0\nT\nX, that is X = U DU with D = diag(\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ). Setting v =\nu\n0 U\nthe inequality MF z * z \u2264 ~ is\nto (49) and one concludes by\n\u0012 now equivalent\n\u0013\nU 0\nnoting that the matrix R =\nis in U(n) (i.e. a symplectic rotation).\n0 U\n(ii) Since symplectic capacities are invariant by symplectic transformations,\nit suffices to prove formula (50) when WF is given by Eqn. (48) or by Eqn.\n(49). In view of Proposition 8 we have c(WF ) =\u03c0~/\u03bbmax and the equality in\n(50) follows noting that the symplectic spectrum of X consists of precisely the\neigenvalues of X. The inequality c(WF ) \u2265 21 h is obvious since Tr X \u2265 \u03bbmax\n18\n\n\fand the inequality c(WF ) \u2264 nh/2 follows from the fact that Tr X \u2264 n\u03bbmax .\nIn view of the double inequality (51) Fermi ellipsoids are not in general\nquantum blobs (except for n = 1). However each of these ellipsoids contains\na quantum blob. To see this\n\u221a it suffices to show that the ellipsoid defined by\n(49) contains the ball B( ~) (because the image of a quantum blob by a\nlinear\u221asymplectic transformation is again a quantum blob). Now, if (x, p) is\nin B( ~) then\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\u03bbj\n2\n2\n(x2j + p2j ) \u2264 ~\n(xj + pj ) \u2264\nTr X\nj=1\nj=1\n\nsince \u03bbj / Tr X \u2264 1 hence our claim.\nLet us discuss the results above on a few simple examples. For the fiducial\n2\ncoherent state \u03a6~ (x) = (\u03c0~)\u2212n/4 e\u2212|x| /2~ we have X = I and Y = 0 hence the\nFermi ellipsoid WF is the disk |x|2 + |p|2 \u2264 n~ whose symplectic capacity is\nn\u03c0~ = nh/2. The operator (40) is here\ngbF = \u2212~2 \u22072x + |x|2 \u2212 n~\n\nand the relation gbF \u03a6~ = 0 is hence equivalent to\n1\n(\u2212~2 \u22072x\n2\n\n+ |x|2 )\u03a6~ = 21 n~\u03a6~\n\n(52)\n\n(53)\n\nwhich simply states the well\u2013known fact that \u03a6~ is an eigenvector of the\nb = 1 (\u2212~2 \u22072 + |x|2 ) corresponding to the\nharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian H\nx\n2\nfirst energy level E0 = 12 n~. One easily verifies that if \u03a8~ is the tensor\n2\nproduct of n copies of the (unnormalised) Hermite functions xe\u2212x /2~ then\nthe equation gbF \u03a8~ = 0 is equivalent to\n1\n(\u2212~2 \u22072x\n2\n\n+ |x|2 )\u03a8~ = 32 n~\u03a8~ .\n\n(54)\n\nThe argument may be repeated, and one finds that the Fermi equation (39)\ncorresponding to a Hermite function, is always equivalent to the eigenstate\nequation for the harmonic oscillator corresponding to that function.\nThe discussion above can be generalised, using metaplectic covariance\nproperties, to the case of quantum states of operators corresponding to arbitrary Hamiltonians H = 21 Mz * z where M is symmetric positive definite\n(generalised harmonic oscillator). It is certainly worthwhile studying what\nhappens in more general cases where the quantum states are no longer Gaussians; see the following discussion.\n19\n\n\f6\n\nConcluding Remarks and Perspectives\n\nUsing the correspondence G defined in Section 3 we have sees that quantum blobs exactly correspond to those quantum states which have minimum\nuncertainty in the sense of Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger. This justifies our claim\nthat quantum blobs represent the smallest regions of phase space which make\nsense from a quantum-mechanical perspective. In fact, contrarily to what is\noften believed the Heisenberg inequalities and their stronger version, the\nRobertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger inequalities (37), are not a statement about the accuracy of our measurement instruments; their derivation assumes on the\ncontrary perfect instruments. The correct interpretation of these inequalities\nis the following (see e.g. Peres [28], p.93): if the same preparation procedure\nis repeated a large number of times, and is followed by either by a measurement of xj , or by a measurement of pj , the results obtained have standard\ndeviations \u2206xj and \u2206pj satisfying these inequalities. Such a process thus\nmakes clear the impossibility of talking about points in phase space having\nsome intrinsic meaning (cf. Butterfield's paper [5] refuting \"pointillisme\").\nWe note that in [6] Dragoman uses the partition of phase space in quantum\nblobs to propose a new formulation of quantum mechanics, based on the\nfollowing postulates:\nAxiom 11 It is not possible to localize a quantum particle in a phase space\nregions smaller that a quantum blob;\nAxiom 12 The phase space extent of a quantum particle is smaller than a\nquantum blob.\nThese postulates and their implications for quantum physics certainly\ndeserve to be discussed further.\nIn a recent paper [18] Hiley and I study a version of the quantum Zeno\nparadox for the Bohm trajectory of a sharply located particle modelled by a\nDirac distribution. We showed in this paper that such a recorded quantum\ntrajectory (in, for instance, a bubble chamber) is just the classical trajectory\npredicted by standard Hamiltonian mechanics. It would be both very interesting and realistic to study this kind of quantum Zeno effect by replacing\nthe point-like particle by a squeezed coherent state, that is, equivalently, by\na quantum blob. A good starting point could be Hiley [21] where the relationship between the Wigner\u2013Moyal and Bohm approaches is elucidated;\n20\n\n\falso the connections with the ideas of Hiley and collaborators in [22, 23, 24]\ncould be useful here. We have seen in Proposition 7 that a quantum blob\nevolves classically under the action of the linear Hamiltonian flow determined by a quadratic Hamiltonian. Of course quadratic Hamiltonians are\nof a very particular type; the result above remains approximately valid for\narbitrary physical Hamiltonians, and this with an excellent approximation\nduring generically very large times (Ehrenfest time, as it is called in the theory of quantum revivals). This observation could allow us to prove, using\nthe correspondence G, the following conjecture considerably extending the\nresults in de Gosson and Hiley [18]:\nConjecture 13 When we continuously observe the motion of a quantum\nblob we see its classical Hamiltonian motion; i.e. an initial quantum blob\nQB 2n will be transformed in the set ftH (QB 2n ) after time t; here ftH is the\nclassical Hamilton flow (Arnol'd [1], Goldstein [9]).\nIn Section 5 we briefly discussed some elementary properties of the Fermi\nfunction gF\u03a8 and of the associated Fermi ellipsoid WF . The discussion was\nactually limited to Gaussian states. We make the following conjecture:\nConjecture 14 Let \u03a8 be a quantum state for which the Fermi equation\ngF (x, p) defines a hypersurface in phase space bounding a compact set \u03a9F .\nThen there exists a symplectic capacity c such that c(\u03a9F ) \u2265 21 h and \u03a9F contains a quantum blob.\nThe observant Reader will perhaps have noticed that the equation gF (x, p) =\n0 for a system of particles with mass m can be rewritten\n1\n(p \u2212 \u2207x \u03a6)2 + Q = 0\n2m\nif one introduces the quantum potential\nQ=\u2212\n\n~2 \u22072x R\n2m R\n\nfamiliar from the Bohmian approach top quantum mechanics (see Bohm and\nHiley [4]). There thus seems to be a deep connection between this theory\nand the phase space approach which certainly deserves to be elucidated and\nextended.\n21\n\n\fI am sure that Basil will be excited by these possibilities, and I look\nforward writing new papers with him about the truly fascinating topic of\nquantum phase space!\nHappy birthday, Basil!\n\nReferences\n[1] Arnold, V.I.: Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, Graduate\nTexts in Mathematics, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag (1989)\n[2] Benenti, G.: Gaussian wave packets in phase space: The Fermi gF function, Am.
