Six spectral settings, covering four H2 16 O and two H2 18 O lines, were observed and all but one H2 18 O\nline were detected. The four H2 16 O lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \u2248 6 km s\u22121 , component centered slightly redward\nof the systemic velocity of NGC7129 FIRS 2 and a much broader, \u2248 25 km s\u22121 component centered blueward and likely associated with powerful\noutflows. The narrower components are consistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around the intermediate mass protostar, and\nthe abundance of H2 O is constrained to \u224810\u22127 for the outer envelope. Additionally, the presence of a narrow self-absorption component for the\nlowest energy lines is likely due to self-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. The broader component, where the H2 O/CO relative\nabundance is found to be \u2248 0.2, appears to be tracing the same energetic region that produces strong CO emission at high J.\nKey words. Stars: formation - ISM: molecules\n\n1. Introduction\nObservations of star formation in nearby molecular clouds have\nprovided a reasonably clear picture of this process for low-mass\nstars. Nevertheless fundamental questions remain. One of these\nis the variation in the formation process between low through\nhigh mass stars. The intermediate mass (IM) sub-program within\nthe Water In Star-forming regions with HERSCHEL (WISH)\nkey program (van Dishoeck et al 2010) aims to use observations\nof water, and complementary molecules, to probe the regions\naround several intermediate mass protostars - focusing on the\nstructure of the envelope and the energetics of the outflow. These\nsources are usually defined as young stellar objects (YSOs) with\nbolometric luminosities between 75 L\u2299 and 2 \u00d7 103 L\u2299 . A key\ngoal for the longer term of this investigation is to place IM star\nformation in context with its low- and high-mass brethren.\nAn excellent example of an extremely young IM protostar is\nNGC7129 FIRS 2 (Eiroa et al 1998; Fuente et al 2001, 2005),\nlocated at a distance of 1260 \u00b1 50 pc from the Sun (Shevchenko\n& Yakubov, 1989). With a luminosity of 500 L\u2299 and estimated\nstellar mass of 5 M\u2299 , FIRS 2 lies near the middle of the IM\nluminosity range. The protostar has produced a hot core (Fuente\net al 2005) but has no evidence for a large, well-developed disk implying it is a young source. A powerful quadrupolar outflow,\n\u22c6\n\nHERSCHEL is an ESA space observatory with science instruments\nprovided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.\n\nlikely due to the superposition of two bipolar jets, is found very\nclose to this source (Fuente et al 2001).\nNGC7129 FIRS 2 has been the subject of significant investigation over the last year. A robust model for the enshrouding, and pre-natal, envelope has been proposed by Crimier et\nal (2010) utilizing all available far infrared (Spitzer) and submillimeter (JCMT, IRAM) brightness measurements. Additionally,\nFich et al (2010) used HERSCHEL PACS observations of highly\nenergetic CO (up to CO J = 33-32 which arises from a level at\nan energy equivalent 3093 K) to analyse the energetics associated with NGC7129 FIRS 2. They found that these CO lines are\nmuch brighter than expected from the envelope alone, revealing\nthe need for additional heating beyond simple reprocessing of\nthe protostellar radiation. A warm slab model with temperatures\ngreater than 1000 K, considered a proxy for shock heating in or\nalong the surfaces of the outflow lobes, provided a much better fit to the CO observations. A lack of spectral resolution in\nthe PACS data hindered further investigation into the connection\nbetween the CO lines and the outflow.\nIn this paper we present a first-look at the water spectra\nobtained toward NGC7129 FIRS 2 with the HIFI instrument\n(de Graauw et al 2010) on the HERSCHEL Space Observatory\n(Pilbratt et al 2010). The wealth of spectrally resolved water\nlines observed provide powerful diagnostic measures for the envelope and the outflow.\n1\n\n\fD. Johnstone et al.: HIFI spectroscopy of NGC7129 FIRS 2\n\n2. Observations\nHERSCHEL HIFI was used to obtain data for this project during the HERSCHEL science demonstration phase and the HIFI\npriority science program, from 3\u201320 March, 2010. The observations were taken using the fast dual-beamswitch mode with a\nstandard nod of 3\u2032 using receiver bands 1, 2, and 4. In total six\nspectral settings were selected, covering four H2 16 O transitions\nand two H2 18 O transitions, with integration times between 15\nminutes and 1 hour. Two isotopologue lines of CO were also\nlocated within these settings. CO 10\u20139 was also observed on\nJune 15, 2010, with a 10 minute integration in band 5 using\nthe fast dual-beamswitch mode. The complete set of observed\nlines are shown in Table 1. All the observations\nwere taken\n\u25e6\ntoward NGC7129 FIRS2, at 21h 43m 1.7 s 66 03\u2032 23\u2032\u2032 (J2000).\nDiffraction-limited beamsizes range from 20\u2032\u2032 \u2013 40\u2032\u2032 (equivalent\nto 25,000 \u2013 50,000 AU at the distance of NGC7129).\nTable 1.

Before the reduction, the chop positions were differenced to check for extended emission and none was detected. During the reduction,\nthe H and V polarizations were compared to assess quality and\nthen averaged. In most cases the two polarizations showed no\nsignificant variations. The H2 16 O 312 \u2013303 line, however, showed\nboth a lower peak intensity and line width for the V polarization,\nresulting in an 8% difference in integrated intensity. For both polarizations, the overall morphology of the spectrum is similar,\nwith the variation likely due to the extended nature of the source\nand slight offsets in the H and V beam positions. Finally, the\nWBS and HRS spectra were compared for consistency. Regions\ncontaining spurs were excluded from the analysis and a first order polynomial baseline was removed from each spectrum. The\nWBS data were ultimately smoothed to the goal resolution of\n1.1 MHz and the antenna temperature T A\u2217 was converted to T mb\nby applying a main beam efficiency of 0.74.\nThe four H2 16 O transitions were observed and are shown in\nFigure 1. The spectra show evidence for at least two components: a narrower line peaked slightly redward of the systemic\nvelocity of the source (\u22129.8 km s\u22121 ) and a broad line blue-shifted\nfrom the systemic velocity. The ground-state transition shows\nsignificant self-absorption, with a minimum at \u221210.4 km s\u22121 ,\nhints of which can be seen in the other observed transitions, and\nis likely due to colder water lying along the line of sight toward\n1\n\nHIPE is a joint development by the HERSCHEL Science Ground\nSegment Consortium, consisting of ESA, the NASA HERSCHEL\nScience Center, and the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE consortia.\n2\n\nFig. 1. H2 O spectra detected toward NGC7129 FIRS 2 with\nHIFI. Note the similarities in morphology between the lines, especially the appearance of at least two emission components,\nnarrow and broad (see Figure 3). The lowest energy transition lines also show evidence for somewhat blue-shifted selfabsorption.\nNGC7129 FIRS 2, with the most likely source of absorption being the protostellar envelope.

Johnstone et al.: HIFI spectroscopy of NGC7129 FIRS 2\n\nBeyond the morphological nature of these lines, it is possible\nto compare the water emission against model predictions. Fich et\nal (2010) note that NGC7129 FIRS 2 has two main components\nwhich may account for the observed emission. The prenatal envelope, which is warmed by the IM protostar embedded within\nit, may produce water emission. Also, the source powers an energetic outflow which could produce water emission either in the\noutflow itself or along the shock heated walls, where the outflow\ninteracts with the denser envelope. In the following subsections,\nwe consider the water emission from each of these components\nand compare the expectations against the HIFI observations.\n3.1. Water from a spherical protostellar envelope\n\nFig. 2. Isotopologue CO and water spectra observed toward\nNGC7129 FIRS 2 with HIFI. Note the width of the isotopologues relative to the main line.\n\nFig. 3. Spectrum of the H2 16 O 202 \u2013 111 transition (blue) superposed with the two Gaussian fit (black) from Table 2. The\nfit includes a narrow, 6.2 km s\u22121 FWHM, component centered\nat -7.2 km s\u22121 (grey) and a much broader, 24.6 km s\u22121 FWHM\ncomponent, shifted slightly blue-ward at -12.4 km s\u22121 (purple).\n\nGaussian components proved reasonably successful for the excited lines (Table 2 & Figure 3). For these three lines, the narrower component was well described by a \u2248 6 km s\u22121 , Gaussian\ncentered redward of the systemic velocity of the source near\n\u22127 km s\u22121 coupled with a broader, 25 km s\u22121 , Gaussian centered near \u221213.5 km s\u22121 (Figures 1 & 3). The likely additional\nabsorption component in each of these spectra could account\nfor the small variations in the line centroids and widths of the\nfits. Similar profiles are seen for low- (Kristensen et al. 2010)\nand high-mass (Chavarr\u0131\u0301a et al. 2010) protostars, where they\nare named medium and broad components. Even narrower lines,\n\u2248 1-2 km s\u22121 FWHM, are seen in self-absorption of the lowestenergy water lines as well as in ground-based emission lines\nsuch as CS 3\u20132. The latter profile also reveals a 6 km s\u22121 component (Fuente et al. 2005).\n\nThe spherical envelope model for NGC7129 FIRS 2 computed\nby Crimier et al (2010) fits the spectral energy distribution from\nthe far infrared through the submillimeter very well and thus provides a reasonable set of physical conditions for examining the\nobserved water emission. This model has an envelope mass of 50\nM\u2299 , an optical depth at 100 \u03bcm of 2.3, an inner radius of 100 AU\nand an outer radius of 18,600 AU. The temperature at the inner\nenvelope radius is 289 K, falling to 100 K at a radius of 373 AU\nwhere the H2 density is 4.4 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 . The density varies as a\npower-law with index -1.4.\nModel water lines were calculated using the RATRAN code\n(Hogerheijde & van der Tak 2000) using collisional cross sections for H2 O-He from Green (1993), scaled by 1.348 to make\na first order approximation for collisions with H2 . An ortho-topara ratio of 3 was assumed for H2 . The density and temperature profile of the Crimier et al (2010) model were followed\nand the radial velocity profile was assumed to be the free-fall\nvelocity appropriate to a central object of mass 1.1 M\u2299 (ie. velocity of -4.2 km s\u22121 at the inner radius and -0.31 km s\u22121 at the\nouter edge). Models were calculated for two abundance zones\nin the envelope: a warm, > 100 K inner envelope with a higher\nabundance and a cooler outer envelope with a lower abundance,\nperhaps characteristic of a \"freeze-out\" zone.\nAs a starting point, we modelled the ortho-H218 O 110 \u2013 101\nobservation. This line has a similar profile to the narrower components of the H2 O lines and if it can be reproduced by the spherical envelope model we may conclude that the narrower component of the H2 O lines also are likely to arise in the envelope. A\nlarge number of models were run over a range of inner (10\u22129 \u2013\n10\u22124 ) and outer (10\u22127 \u20133\u00d710\u221211) envelope abundances. The nonthermal velocity width parameter b was also varied and values\n\u2265 3 km s\u22121 were strongly ruled out, while b = 1 km s\u22121 produced too narrow a line. The best fit was found for b = 2 km s\u22121 .\nThe abundance of ortho-H218 O in the outer envelope is wellconstrained to be 3 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10\u221210 , while inner envelope abundances between 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 produce results consistent with the integrated flux of the ortho-H2 18 O 110 \u2013 101 line\n(Table A.1). These are surprisingly high values; indeed, the top\nend of this range is impossible when the cosmic 18 O abundance\nis considered. The para-H2 18 O 202 \u2013 111 was modeled in a similar\nway. The non-detection of this line constrains the outer envelope\nabundance of para-H2 18 O to \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 . The model fits are insensitive to the inner envelope abundance used (Table A.2) and\nthis may be a consequence of beam dilution.\nAssuming that the ratio of 16 O/18 O = 550 is also representative of the ratios of both of the ortho and para H2 O/H2 18 O, we\nexamined models for the narrower components of the H2 O lines\nwith outer envelope abundances near 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 and inner abundances up to 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 (limited by the cosmic O abundance). The\nbest fitting models indicate that the outer envelope abundance of\n3\n\n\fD. Johnstone et al.: HIFI spectroscopy of NGC7129 FIRS 2\n\ntotal H2 O is of order a few 10\u22127 , and are summarised in Table\n3. The ortho to para ratio implied by the best fit outer envelope\nabundances is 10:1, this is highly unlikely and within the calibration (\u226432%) and model uncertainties the ratio is consistent with\n3. The abundance of the inner envelope could not be constrained\nand the observed line profiles were poorly reproduced, particularly in the case of the para lines. Whilst the parameter space of\nthe models are still not fully explored, this suggests limitations\nin the model used with the assumptions concerning the velocity\nfield and spherical structure most suspect.\nTable 3. Overview of best fitting spherical envelope models\n\nAbove T = 150 K the results are insensitive to changes in temperature. The abundance ratio is found to be \u2248 0.2 near the line centre and approaches 0.3 at the highest velocities in the red wing\n(Table A.3). This is consistent with the findings from the slab\nmodel and also with the behaviour seen in the low-mass sources\nof Kristensen et al. (2010), who report this indicates that \u2248 10%\nof the available O is in H2 O.\nThat the same model can be used to fit both the PACS CO\nobservations and the broad component of the HIFI H2 O lines\nsupports the hypothesis that these lines arise along shock heated\nwalls in the outflow cavity. Shock models will allow to better\nconstrain the conditions under which these broad lines arise.\n\n4.

Water from a slab model\n\nFich et al 2010 concluded that the energetic PACS CO lines observed toward NGC7129 FIRS 2 could not be fit by a reprocessing spherical envelope model as there was an insufficient volume\nof warm gas to produce the strong emission observed. It was\npostulated that the CO emission might arise along shock heated\nwalls in the outflow cavity, where the gas temperature can reach\nextreme values. NGC7129 FIRS 2 is known to contain a powerful outflow (Fuente et al 2001) and observations of low-mass\nstars have shown that such outflows can produce heated walls\nvia UV photons (van Kempen et al 2009) and shocks (Gianninni\net al 1999, van den Ancker et al 2000, Nisini et al 2002, Arce\net al 2007, van Kempen et al 2010). Fich et al (2010) used the\nRADEX code to show that the observed CO emission could be\nexplained within a model of a slab geometry with a temperature\nof 1100 K, an H2 density of 1.0 \u00d7 108 cm\u22123 , and a CO column\ndensity of 1014 cm\u22122 . This model constrained the lowest temperature at which the CO observations could be adequately fit. A\nmore comprehensive set of CO models was produced for this\npaper, and a best fit is found for a temperature of 1200 K, an H2\ndensity of 107 cm\u22123 and a column density of CO of 1.7 \u00d7 1014\ncm\u22122 . Assuming a CO abundance of 10\u22124 , these results suggest\na slab with thickness dz \u223c 1010 cm.\nUsing these same conditions (1200 K and 107 cm\u22123 ), but\nsubstituting water for CO, may provide an additional constraint\non the possible shock heating conditions, and the conditions under which the broad component of the water lines arise. The water lines observed with HIFI set the limit on the ortho-H2O column at 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 while the para-H2O lines observed\nset a maximum limit in the column at 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 ,\ngiving an ortho-to-para ratio of 3.\nThese models imply a water abundance that is approximately\nfive times lower than CO and can be compared with that found\nfrom analysis of the H2 O and CO line ratios in the line wing,\nwhere the emission is optically thin. The CO 10\u20139 line exhibits\na similar profile to that seen in the H2 O lines (Figure A.1) and\nbe compared directly with the H2 O 202 \u2013 111 line, as they are\nobserved in almost the same beam (22\" vs 19\"). The abundance\nratio was calculated with RADEX using a density of 106 cm\u22123 .\n4\n\nHERSCHEL HIFI spectroscopy of water in the vicinity of the\nintermediate mass protostar NGC7129 FIRS 2 has revealed that\nthe water emission arises from at least two sources. The observed emission lines can be decomposed into both a narrower,\u2248\n6 km s\u22121 , component and a much broader, \u2248 25 km s\u22121 component. The integrated intensity of the narrower component can be\nfit by a simple free-falling envelope model with an outer envelope total H2 O abundance of \u2248 10\u22127 , although the shape of the\nline profiles are not reproduced. The broader component appears\nto be related to the heated gas already observed in high-J CO\nlines with PACS and associated with the known energetic outflow. These initial modeling results suggest that a dedicated parameter study for this source should prove extremely fruitful in\nconstraining the physical and chemical conditions in NGC7129\nFIRS 2.\nAcknowledgements.
