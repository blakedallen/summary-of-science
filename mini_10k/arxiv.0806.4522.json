In this first paper we formulate a generalized\nGrad-Shafranov equation which determines the self-generated equilibrium magnetic field,\nvia a quiescent dynamo effect.\nThe occurrence of dynamo effects of this type is essentially ubiquitous in character both\nin laboratory and space plasmas. In particular, it is well known that the phenomenon may\nexist even in plasmas which are at fluid (or kinetic) equilibrium, or sufficiently close to it, in\nthe sense that the fluid fields (and, respectively, the kinetic distribution function) characterizing the plasma are stationary (or quasi-stationary). This corresponds to the appearance\nof a self-generated magnetic field in quiescent plasmas, i.e., in the absence of significant\nturbulence phenomena. The same may happen also in accretion disk (AD) plasmas. In\nparticular, the self-generated magnetic field may become comparable in magnitude, or even\nlarger, than that may be produced by the central object. This circumstance, it should be\nstressed, might occur even in the case of low density AD plasmas. In this paper we intend\nto pose the problem of the theoretical description of self-consistent gravitational plasma\nequilibria appropriate for modelling AD plasmas (in this context, what is meant by an\n\"equilibrium\" is stationary-flow solution). Their investigation is of fundamental importance\nfor understanding the phenomenology of accretion disks. The very existence of these equilibria is actually suggested by observations, which show evidence of quiescent and essentially\nnon-relativistic, AD plasmas close to compact stars, thus indicating that accretion disks may\nbe characterized by slowly varying EM and fluid fields. Gravitational Hall-MHD equilibria\n(G-Hall-MHD) represent an important aspect of the phenomenology accretion disk (AD)\nplasmas. This is true especially for those AD which occur near compact objects (black\nholes, neutron stars, etc. ) where the presence of strong EM fields is expected. These fields,\nand particularly the electric field, may locally be extremely intense, so that AD plasmas are\nlikely to be locally non-neutral and therefore characterized by the presence of Hall currents.\nIn this paper we analyze the combined role of the diamagnetic effects arising in a rotating\nplasma, Hall currents produced by local deviations from charge neutrality, and the influence\nof space-time curvature produced by the central object. It is important to stress, however,\nthat two classes of equilibria can in principle be distinguished, which are respectively fluid\n2\n\n\fand also kinetic. In the first case only the fluid fields are required to be stationary, while in\nthe second also the kinetic distribution function must be stationary. In addition, for kinetic\nequilibria, additional prescriptions can in principle be added. Therefore, the two problems,\nalthough evidently related, should be treated separately. The purpose of this work is the\ninvestigation of the first type of equilibrium. In particular, here we intend to address the\nproblem of the formulation of a generalized Grad-Shafranov (GGS) equation suitable for\nthe investigation of G-Hall-MHD equilibria in AD's. The investigation of kinetic equilibria is instead left to the accompanying paper [8]. Based on a two-fluid description of the\nplasma, in which relativistic corrections due to space-time curvature are taken into account\nonly by introducing a suitable Pseudo-Newtonian potential, the theory is applicable to the\ninvestigation of axisymmetric equilibria which occur in the central regions of the AD where\nthe plasma particles are taken to still be non relativistic in the sense that their rotational\nvelocities are much smaller that c. In the same region the plasma flow velocity and current\ndensity of each plasma species are determined self-consistently by taking into account the\nrelevant diamagnetic currents, including the Hall current and the gravitational drift produced by space-time curvature. The theory permits the explicit numerical determination of\nthe equilibrium magnetic field. The approach appears to be relevant for the investigation of\na variety of possible plasma equilibria in AD's. Despite earlier investigations, carried out by\nseveral authors, including for example Chandrasekhar (1956, [1]) and Morozov and Solov'ev\n(1963, [2]) and more recently by Krasheninnikov and Catto [3], Throumoulopoulos and Tasso\n(2001) [4], McClements and A. Thyagaraya (2001, [5]) and by Ghanbari and Abbassi (2004,\n[6]), a consistent theoretical description of these equilibria - a challange for astrophysicists\nand mathematical physicists alike - has not yet been obtained. We refer in particular both to\nthe approximate solutions and to the nature of the physical models adopted so far. For example, in some of previous works, factorized approximate solutions for the dipolar magnetic\nfield were used [3, 4], while in many cases the AD model is based on a single-fluid ideal-MHD\ndescription, assuming quasi-neutral rotating or non-rotating plasmas (see for example [3])\nwhich are assumed to be subject to the action of a purely classical Newtonian potential for\nthe central object. Other treatments [6], which investigate the problem of self-gravitating\naccretion disks, adopt a self-similar solution method while ignoring completely relativistic\neffects and the possible presence of self-generated EM fields. In a subsequent development\nMcClements and Thyagaraja [5] tackled the problem of constructing the relevant set of fluid\n3\n\n\fequations, in particular a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for the magnetic field, to\nbe applied to numerical simulations of gravitational AD plasmas.\n\nTheir approach, while\n\nstill considering only a purely non-relativistic quasi-neutral plasma, represents an interesting\ndevelopment. In fact, adopting a more realistic two-fluid model based on ideal-MHD equations, it allows - in principle - the numerical investigation of gravitational plasma equilibria\nwith arbitrary flows and subject to the action of an arbitrary self-consistent (axisymmetric)\nmagnetic field. Nevertheless several aspects of the theory deserve further investigation. A\nfirst basic issue is related to the very formulation of the theoretical model appropriate for\nAD plasmas. In fact, AD's close to compact objects can be characterized by extremely\nintense EM (both magnetic and electric) fields as well by gravitational fields. It follows that\nAD plasmas are likely to be locally non-neutral and therefore Hall currents may be present.\nThis suggests therefore that such equilibria should be described in the framework of the\nHall-MHD theory. These equilibria are here denoted as gravitational Hall-MHD (G-HallMHD) equilibria. In addition, for the description of equilibria occurring close to compact\nstars, the effect of space-time curvature is expected to become significant. Another problem\nto be further clarified, however, is related to the determination of the self-generated toroidal\nmagnetic field arising in AD plasmas. In fact at equilibrium, in the absence of radial flows\nand of an externally-generated toroidal magnetic field, the self-consistent magnetic field is\nexpected to be purely poloidal. Its precise relationship with the poloidal magnetic field in\nthe plasma as well with the relevant diamagnetic currents driven by plasma inhomogeneities\nand flows has yet to be determined. Finally, an interesting theoretical issue is related to\nthe possible existence of bifurcated plasma equilibria. These might correspond to AD's\ncharacterized - in some suitable sense - by the presence of \"high\" or \"low\" magnetic fields\nrespectively. Besides the existence of the bifurcation effect, an interesting closely related\nquestion is obviously its possible role in the determination of the observed phenomenology\nof AD's occurring close to compact objects. In this paper, the focus of the investigation is\non the combined role of the diamagnetic effects produced by the rotating plasma, and in\nparticular the influence of Hall current and of space-time curvature, for the possible generation of quiescent dynamo effects in these equilibria. This permits a detailed analysis of\nthe formation and the structure of these equilibria occurring in the central regions of the\nAD where non-relativistic plasmas are actually expected. Extending previous approaches,\n(in particular Krashennikov and Catto, 1999 [3] and Throumoulopoulos and Tasso, 2001 [4]\n4\n\n\fand McClements and Thyagaraja, 2001 [5]), the main goal of this work is the formulation of\na generalized Grad-Shafranov (GGS) equation suitable for the investigation of G-Hall-MHD\nequilibria in AD's where non-relativistic plasmas are present (Cremaschini et al., 2008 [7]).\nFor this purpose the equilibria are assumed to be generated by a strong axisymmetric stellar\nmagnetic field and by the gravitating plasma characterizing the AD. Basic features of the\ntheoretical model adopted include: the assumptions of finite plasma rotation, two-species\nfluid fields, divergence-free electric current density and (primarily) toroidal plasma current.\nAs a consequence, an equilibrium equation is obtained from Ampere's law for the poloidal\nmagnetic flux function. An approximate solution method for the GGS equation is presented\nwhich allows one to construct systematically approximate analytical solutions near the equatorial plane of the AD. The approach may be relevant for the investigation of a variety of\npossible G-Hall-MHD equilibria in AD's.\n\nII.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF GRAVITATIONAL-HALL-MHD EQUILIBRIA\n\nLet us now assume that the AD plasma is formed by two species of charged particles: one\nspecies of ions and one of electrons. The plasma is considered stationary, \"collisionless\" (or,\nin a proper sense, weakly collisional) and axisymmetric, i.e., independent of the azimuth\n\u03c6 when referred to a set of cylindrical coordinates (R, \u03c6, z) for which the axis R = 0 is\na principal axis. In such a case a complete description of the plasma can be obtained in\nterms of the species-dependent number density (ns ), flow velocity (Vs ) and tensor-pressure\n(\u03a0s ), together with the EM fields {E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6, B} , both externally produced and/or selfgenerated, and the effective gravitational potential produced by the central object and by\nthe plasma itself, in which the plasma is immersed. In particular, denoting by b the local\nunit vector of the magnetic field B, ignoring electron inertia contributions and the effect of\nbinary collisions, the species momentum balance equations read respectively for ions and\nelectrons\nmi ni Vi * \u2207Vi + \u2207 * \u03a0i + mi ni \u2207R U ef f \u2212 qs ni E \u2212\n\u2207 * \u03a0e \u2212 qe ne E \u2212\n\nqi\nni Vi \u00d7 B = 0,\nc\n\nqe\nne Ve \u00d7 B = 0.\nc\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nIt follows that the plasma current density takes the form J = Jk b + J\u22a5H + J\u22a5D , where Jk is\nthe parallel current density to be defined so as to fulfill identically the isochoricity condition\n5\n\n\f\u2207 * J = 0. Here J\u22a5H =\n\nc\u03c1E\u00d7b\nB\n\nand J\u22a5D =\n\nc\u03c1E(d) \u00d7b\nB\n\ndenote respectively the so-called Hall and\n\ndiamagnetic current densities, while \u03c1 and E(d) are the local charge density of the plasma\nand the diamagnetic electric field E(d) at equilibrium, which is defined so that\n\u03c1E(d) \u2261 \u2212mi ni Vi * \u2207Vi \u2212 \u2207 * \u03a0 \u2212 mi ni \u2207R U ef f .\n\n(3)\n\nHere U ef f denotes a suitable effective (pseudo-Newtonian) gravitational potential taking into\naccount relativistic corrections of the Newtonian potential [7]. Moreover, we assume that for\nP\n\u03a0s is diagonal, i.e., \u03a0s is of the\na strongly magnetized plasma, the tensor pressure \u03a0 =\ns=e,i\n\u0001\nform \u03a0s = Psk bb+Ps 1 \u2212 bb , where Psk and Ps denote respectively the scalar parallel and\nperpendicular pressures for each species defined with respect to the magnetic field direction\n(b). In the following they are assumed to be suitably prescribed scalar fields, for example,\nto be considered as specified by means of an appropriate fluid or kinetic closure condition\nor directly determined via experimental observations or from numerical experiments.

In the following we\nshall ignore the effects due to the gravitational self-field of the plasma and require\nPsk = Ps + \u03b41 ps ,\n\n(4)\n\nVs (r, t) = VT s e\u03c6 + \u03b42 VR eR + \u03b42 Vz ez ,\n\n(5)\n\nB = Bp + \u03b5BT \u2261 \u2207\u03c8 \u00d7 \u2207\u03c6 + \u03b43 I(\u03c8)e\u03c6 ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b43 \u226a 1,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nwhere \u03b4i (i = 1, 2, 3) are dimensionless parameters.

In this case the gravitational-Hall-MHD (G-Hall-MHD) formulation\nis simply achieved by invoking the stationary Maxwell equations for the equilibrium EM\nfields and the momentum equations for Vs for each species. Let us determine explicitly the\ntoroidal angular rotation velocity \u03a9s for each species. In this case, invoking the ordering\n(7) and neglecting corrections proportional to \u03b4i (for i = 1, 2, 3), the \u2207R component of the\nmomentum equation for ions gives the bifurcated solutions:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0014\n\u0015\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n1\n(\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207R)\nmi 1\n(\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207R)\n\u03a9i \u00b1 =\n\u2212qi\n+4\n\u00b1\n\u2207R Pi + qi \u2207R \u03c6 + mi \u2207R U ef f\n,\nqi\n\uf8fe\n2mi \uf8f3\ncR\ncR\nR ni\n(8)\n\nwhere qi is the ion electric charge (while in the following qe denotes the electron charge).\nFor electrons, neglecting electron-inertia effects and considering again the \u2207R component\nof the momentum equation, one obtains\n1 \u2202Pe\n\u2202\u03c6\n+c\n.\n\u03a9e \u223c\n=c\n\u2202\u03c8\nqe ne \u2202\u03c8\n\n(9)\n\nFinally, in the same approximation, the \u2207z components of the same equations gives respectively two constraint equations for the (isotropic) scalar pressure of each species Ps = ns Ts ,\ni.e., respectively for ions and electrons\n\u0013\n\u0012\nR\u03a9i\n(\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207z) + ni mi \u2207z U ef f = 0.\n\u2207z Pi + ni qi \u2212\u2207z \u03c6 +\ncR\n\u0012\n\u0013\nR\u03a9e\n\u2207z Pe + ne qe \u2212\u2207z \u03c6 +\n(\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207z) = 0.\ncR\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThese results show at once that in the present case:\n\n\u2022 The fluid (G-Hall-MHD) equilibria admit generally two distinct solutions \u03a9i \u00b1 for the\nion angular velocity. Both of them are in principle admissible. Nevertheless, one\ncan see that in the limit in which all the terms become small and negligible except\nthe gravitational one, one recovers the customary Keplerian (or pseudo-Keplerian)\nsolution. Nevertheless, in general AD plasmas, both signs are admissible and they\n7\n\n\fcorrespond to the two possible rotational directions of the ion species (clockwise or\ncounterclockwise, according to the unit vector which defines the reference system).\nAs a basic implication, in the two cases the parallel and the diamagnetic currents\nmay differ significantly. In such a case the bifurcation is expected to give rise to\nquite disparate physical conditions for the AD, which correspond respectively to the\noccurrence of \"strong\" and \"weak\" poloidal magnetic fields in the AD plasma.\nThe existence domain of the velocity solution is determined by requiring the strictly\npositivity of the argument of the square root:\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207R)\nmi 1\nef f\nqi\n>0\n+4\n\u2207R Pi + qi \u2207R \u03c6 + mi \u2207R U\ncR\nR ni\n\n(12)\n\nThis domain is determined by the magnetic field, the pressure, the density, the electrostatic\nand gravitational profiles. Whenever the above condition is violated, the ion velocity becomes imaginary. As this is a non-physical solution, we say that in the domains where this\nhappens the equilibrium does not exist.\n\u2022 The treatment of the gravitational field produced by the central massive object is\nhandled by the introduction of a pseudo-Newtonian potential Gef f [7]. This allows us\nto take into account relativistic corrections carried by the local space-time curvature.\n\u2022 The density and pressure profiles for ions and electrons (ni , ne and Pi , Pe ) remain in\nprinciple arbitrary, being subject only to the species constraint equations (10). In\nparticular, if the density profiles are prescribed together with the pressure of each\nspecies on the equatorial plane, [i.e., Ps (R, z = 0)], Eq.(10) determines uniquely, for\neach species s, the vertical profile (i.e., the z\u2212dependence) of the its partial pressure\nPs .\n\u2022 In the central region of the AD where \u03a9e is sufficiently large [see Eq.(9)] the electrostatic field, in particular its component E\u03c8 = \u2212\u2207\u03c8 * \u2207\u03c6/|\u2207\u03c8| which drives the\ntoroidal rotation of the electrons, is expected to become very strong.\nLet us now investigate the relevant Maxwell equations: the Poisson equation for the\nelectrostatic field E and Ampere's law for the magnetic field. These give respectively for the\nelectrostatic potential \u03c6 and the poloidal flux function the pde's\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u22022\u03c6\n1 \u2202\nR\n+ 2 = \u22124\u03c0 (|qi |ni \u2212 |e|ne ) ,\nR \u2202R\n\u2202R\n\u2202z\n8\n\n(13)\n\n\f1 \u22022\u03c8\n1 \u22022\u03c8\n4\u03c0R\n+\n=\u2212\n(|qi |ni \u03a9i \u2212 |e|ne \u03a9e ) ,\n2\n2\nR \u2202z\nR \u2202R\nc\n\n(14)\n\nto be identified respectively with the Poisson equation and the generalized Grad-Shafranov\nequation.\n\nIV.\n\nCONDITIONS OF VALIDITY AND CLOSURE CONDITIONS\n\nWe now make a few comments on the theory developed here. The first one concerns the\nassumption of a weakly collisional plasma for the AD, whereby the various (plasma) species\nare allowed to have different velocities. This requires that the mean free path for all of the\nspecies must be assumed to be much larger than the characteristic macroscopic scale length\n(L) of the relevant fluid fields (\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6N ). In particular, L can be identified locally with\nL = inf i=1,N (Li ), where L\u22121\n= |\u2207 ln \u03c6i | is the scale length associated with the gradient of\ni\nthe fluid field \u03c6i . This assumption has the important consequence that the current density\n(and hence the self-consistent magnetic field which it generates) can become very strong\neven in a low density plasma. A second aspect concerns the physical conditions in which\nHall-current effects are expected to play a significant role for G-Hall-MHD equilibria. In this\nregard it is important to point out again that Eq.(9) implies that in the central regions of\nthe AD, where \u03a9e is sufficiently large, the electrostatic field can be expected to become very\nstrong. Hence, local deviations from quasi-neutrality, should be expected in these equilibria.\nq\n2 2\nThis means that the Debye length \u03bbDs = 1/ 4\u03c0ZTsse ns of each species may become locally\ncomparable to the macroscopic characteristic scale length (L) of the plasma equilibrium.\n\nThe third aspect concerns the peculiar feature discovered here for G-Hall-MHD equilibria,\nrelated to the existence of bifurcated solutions for the ion toroidal angular velocity. It is\nobvious that, for a prescribed magnetic field (produced by the central object), the direction\nof ion flow velocity in the outer regions of the AD uniquely determines the sign of the ion\ntoroidal angular frequency also in the central region. As a consequence, it depends on the\ndirection of injection for the charged particles at the external boundary of the disk, where\nthe plasma flow is expected to be almost Keplerian. With the specification of this boundary\ncondition the equilibrium solution therefore becomes unique.\nAnother issue is related to the closure conditions for the Hall-MHD equations. To resolve\nthe indeterminacy in the density and pressure of each species the equilibrium magnetic and\n\n9\n\n\felectric fields have been determined under the assumption of suitably prescribing the pressure\nof each species on the equatorial plane Ps (R, z = 0). We can motivate the necessity and the\nuse itself of the closure relations by the following arguments:\n1) this is a standard approach in plasma physics. For example, the same technique is\nused while studying plasma equilibria for laboratory plasmas;\n2) generally, the set of fluid equations for plasmas may not be closed even at equilibrium,\nat least in the case of locally non-Maxwellian kinetic equilibria.\nIn general, the closure problem may be solved by adopting one of the following alternative\napproaches:\n1) taking the density or temperature profiles for each species from experimental data.\nThis would require observational data to be reduced and compared with theoretical models.\nOn the other hand, the theoretical model also suggests possible interesting developments\nrelated specifically to the adoption of:\n2) phenomenological fluid closure conditions (from numerical experiments);\n3) kinetic closure conditions, in which the undetermined fluid fields are prescribed via\nkinetic theory.\nFinally - as indicated above - a completely different viewpoint lies in the investigation of\nkinetic equilibria. This involves the requirement that the G-Hall-MHD equilibrium corresponds actually to an underlying kinetic equilibrium, to be suitably prescribed. This point\nand related issues relevant for the fluid/kinetic evaluation of G-Hall-MHD equilibria will be\ndiscussed in greater detail in the accompanying paper [8].\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper the relevant equations which describe G-Hall-MHD equilibria have been\ninvestigated. From the above analysis we summarize the following main aspects:\n1) the relevant equations describing fluid equilibria of this type have been obtained under\nthe assumption of axial symmetry and a collisionless plasma;\n2) the effect produced by equilibrium diamagnetic currents generated by the plasma,\nincluding non-neutrality and the Hall current, have been taken into account;\n3) the effect of differential rotation produced by the non rigid toroidal rotation of the AD\nhas been taken into account by including the toroidal angular frequency of each species;\n10\n\n\f4) allowance has been made for the inclusion of relativistic effects by taking into account\nthe space-time curvature generated by the central compact object;\n5) no assumption of local quasi-neutrality has been invoked.\nThe present theory can be generalized in several ways, to include - in particular - the\nkinetic treatment of G-Hall-MHD equilibria (to be discussed in the accompanying paper\n[8]), species-dependent flow velocities having both toroidal and radial flow velocities, as well\nas the additional presence of a toroidal magnetic field produced by the plasma flows, of an\nanisotropic pressure tensor and of self-gravitating AD's. Based on the present theory, GHall-MHD equilibria can be investigated utilizing a perturbative solution method based on\na power series expansion near to the equatorial plane (z = 0) [7]. This permits an analysis\nof the combined role of Hall, diamagnetic and relativistic curvature effects, which are all\nexpected to play a significant role in the central regions of AD's.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been developed in cooperation with the CMFD Team, Consortium for\nMagneto-fluid-dynamics (Trieste University, Trieste, Italy), within the framework of the\nMIUR (Italian Ministry of University and Research) PRIN Programme: Modelli della teoria\ncinetica matematica nello studio dei sistemi complessi nelle scienze applicate.
