This appears to suggest that\nquantum interference effects from the voltage probes play\na crucial role in producing this surprising phenomenon.\nIn this comment we point out a set of serious contradictions.\nGao et al. have analyzed their results by the multiterminal theory of B\u00fcttiker [2]. We do not comment here\non the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker method used for a currentdriven system with multiple test probes, with an equal\nmultiplicity of individual chemical potentials. The invocation of several distinct chemical potentials, in various\nparts of the one system, is moot from the statistical mechanics point of view, and is discussed elsewhere in the\nliterature [3,4].\nIn a four-probe measurement, one attempts to gauge\nthe natural voltage drop between two separated voltage\nprobes (3 and 4 in this case). Such a procedure has to\nbe highly noninvasive [5] if a meaningful, intrinsic sample\nresistance is to be extracted. \"Noninvasivity\" means no\ndisruption whatsoever to the current flow inherent in the\nsample. Therefore, the voltage drop is a true measure of\nintrinsic resistance.\nGao et al. argued that the chemical potentials \u03bc3 and\n\u03bc4 are both bounded by \u03bc1 above, and \u03bc2 below; see\nFigure 1 of Ref. [1]. The ratio of the four-point and twopoint resistances is then R4PT /R2PT = (\u03bc3 \u2212 \u03bc4 )/(\u03bc1 \u2212\n\u03bc2 ). According to B\u00fcttiker's theory [2], this is equivalent\nto R4PT /R2PT = [T31 T42 \u2212 T32 T41 ]/[(T31 + T32 )(T41 +\nT42 )] in terms of the transmission probability functions\nTij . If \u03bc3 > \u03bc4 , then R4PT is positive; but if \u03bc3 < \u03bc4 ,\nthen R4PT is negative. The transmission functions Tij\nalone determine the sign. Gao et al. seem to believe\nthat R4PT < 0 comes from strong quantum interference\neffects.\nTo cause significant interference, the Tij s must depend sensitively on the different pathways from the different voltage probes. In the samples of Ref. [1] the voltage probes are a series of complex multi-wall nanotube\nstructures. Unlike in the de Picciotto et al. experiment\n[5], here the probes' noninvasiveness is less transparent\nin terms of measurability and controllability. Unless the\nvoltage probes are known to be noninvasive, the notion\nof an intrinsic sample resistance has little meaning. In\nour view the results and intepretation in Ref. [1] contain\nseveral major contradictions.\n(a) In the analysis of Gao et al. a negative R4PT arises\n\nif and only if the numerator is negative in the B\u00fcttiker\nratio. For that to happen, T32 T41 > T31 T42 . A transmission function usually depends on the height and width of\nits barrier. For the identical and symmetrically placed\nprobes 3 and 4, the distances between 3&2 and 1&4 exceed 3&1 and 4&2. The larger the distance, the smaller\nthe transmission. Hence, elementary geometry makes the\nabove condition unlikely.\n(b) Now consider the original Landauer formulas\nfor two-point and four-point resistance [3]. R2PT =\n(h/2e2 )/T and R4PT = (h/2e2 )R/T , where T and R are\ntotal transmission and reflection functions respectively.\nThe formula for R4PT can be derived from the B\u00fcttiker\nrelation; see Eq. (3.301) of Ferry and Goodnick [6]. The\neigenvalues of R and T are bounded by 0 and 1, and\nR = 1 \u2212 T > 0 must conserve unitary probability.\nBecause R2PT is positive, T is certainly positive. But\nif R4PT is negative, as in Gao et al., it means that R < 0.\nTherefore T > 1. How does this conserve probability?\n(c) R4PT is the desired sample resistance. It is a\nlinear-response quantity measured at small applied fields.\nAt zero temperature, it is an inherent property of the\nequilibrium ground state for the (presumably thermodynamically stable) device. If a well calibrated noninvasive\nmethod were to be used, one would expect R4PT to be\nzero (ideal metal/ballistic case) [5] or very small, depending on any residual dissipation. The intrinsic resistance\nof the sample must, at the very least, be nonnegative to\nrespect the Joule heating law W = IV \u2265 0 and thus to\nguarantee thermodynamic stability.\nWe wish to thank Dr Adrian Bachtold for useful correspondence.\n[1] B.
