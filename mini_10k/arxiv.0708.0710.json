We argue that this hole tagging calls for a subtler description of the correlated bands\nthan the usual one. We also map in great detail the underdoped superconducting phase diagram\nTc vs hole doping which shows that the number of mobile holes is not the critical parameter for the\nsuperconductivity.\n\nThe behaviour of a hole in the cuprate doped MottHubbard insulator is often described in a universal picture, where, above some critical concentration, it forms\nthe Zhang-Rice singlet [1], in a single correlated-band\nscheme. However structural and compositional details\nof each specific compound do influence the fine grain\nbehaviour. This is particularly true in the region of\nthe metal-insulator (MI)transition , where there is growing evidence that the competition between antiferromagnetic (AF) order and superconductivity is strongly influenced by disorder [2], leading to different phase diagrams\n[3, 4, 5] in different real materials.\nGrowing evidence that more than one band is needed\ncomes from Cax La1.25 Ba1.75\u2212x Cu3 O6+y , where two distinct charge fluids have been reported [6] by NQR. At\noptimum doping tunneling spectroscopy directly detects\n[7] two CuO2 gaps in Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y , and \u03bcSR\nprovides additional supporting evidence [8] in the case of\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 . In the underdoped regime early NMR\n[9, 10] and recent magnetotransport [11] results demonstrate additional thermally activated doped holes. The\nactivation energy, proportional to x\u22121 , has been shown\nto scale with relevant ARPES Fermi-arc features and it\nhas been linked directly to the pseudogap [12]. Further\ndetails, such as the presence of Fermi pockets, from high\nfield quantum oscillations [13], call for a subtler band\nstructure implementation [14]. Activated holes are also\nindirectly detected through the magnetic order parameter reduction measured with NQR and \u03bcSR [15, 16]. It\nseems that at least two bands[17] are needed to correctly\ndescribe real cuprates.\nIn order to focus this issue we zoomed into the MI\ntransition region of Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y , where two\ndistinct doping mechanisms can be independently controlled. Charge doping is provided both by heterovalent\nCa+2 \u2192Y+3 substitution, x, and by interstitial oxygen\ncontent, y, in the Cu(1)O chain layer, yielding a total\nhole concentration h = hCa +hO transferred to the active\nCu(2)O2 layers. We thus directly show that the two contributions behave very differently with respect to room\ntemperature normal properties and superconductivity.\nPolycrystalline samples were prepared by a topotactic\n\ntechnique, which consists in the oxygen equilibration of\nstoichiometric quantities of the two end members, tightly\npacked in sealed vessels [18]. Low temperature annealing\nyields high quality homogeneous samples with an absolute error of \u03b4x = \u00b10.02 in oxygen content per formula\nunit (reduced to \u00b10.01 after recalibrating end member of\ndifferent batches). Besides this determination, absolute\noxygen content is cross checked by iodometric titration,\nthermogravimetry on each sample and selected neutron\nRietveld refinements. Ca content is checked by X-ray\nand neutron Rietveld refinements. Reported error bars\nare the global error from this procedure. Transition temperatures correspond to the linear extrapolation of the\n90 % to 10% diamagnetic drop of the susceptibility, measured in a field \u03bc0 H = 0.2 mT. These data agree within\nquoted uncertainties with resistive determinations (and\n\u03bcSR, when available). The width of the interval where\nthe resistance drops from 90% to 10% of the onset value\nis typically 6 K for y \u2264 0.4, like for Ca free pellets and\nlarge single crystals (see Ref. [4] and Refs. therein).\nThe inset in Fig. 1 shows the progressive reduction of\nTc vs. x in the y \u2243 0.9 end members (our starting polycrystals, reacted and annealed in oxygen atmosphere),\nwitnessing the double doping mechanism[19, 20]. The\nsuperconducting transition measured by SQUID magnetometry is progressively reduced from the maximum\nTc = 92K at x = 0 (optimal doping), as Ca substitution injects additional holes: both hCa and hO contribute\nto superconductivity, driving the samples into the overdoped region. The smooth linear dependence of Tc (x)\nof the inset in Fig. 1 also guarantees an effective Ca-Y\nsubstitution in the whole explored range.\nHowever, when tuning of the oxygen content drives\nthese same samples to low doping, close to the MI boundary, we find a markedly different behaviour. Figure 1\ndisplays the critical temperature, Tc , versus oxygen content, y, for series of samples at fixed calcium content,\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.14. Surprisingly Tc falls on the same curve for\nall series with x \u2264 0.09, giving rise to superconductivity at the same critical oxygen concentration, yc = 0.30:\nthe injection of additional holes with calcium does not\nappreciably influence Tc , in our underdoped, x \u2264 0.09\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1:\nSuperconducting transition temperatures Tc of\nY1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y samples vs. oxygen concentration for\nthe whole set of samples: The y \u2264 0.09 data fall on the same\nline (curves are guides to the eye).

The different cationic radii (RCa+2 /RY +3 \u2248 1.1) may trivially alter\noxygen order in the Cu(1)O chains, reducing their charge\ntransfer efficiency. This is the case, e.g., for substantial\nY substitutions [21], where the formation of chains takes\nplace at much larger oxygen content. An independent\nassessment of the hole content is required to rule out this\neffect. The Seebeck coefficient is an independent measure\nof the mobile carrier content, since an exponential dependence of S vs h is observed in YBa2 Cu3 O6+y in a large\nrange of doping. [19, 20] We systematically measured the\nvalue of S at T =290 K (RT) in our samples, calibrating\nthe dependence on the fully reduced compounds, y \u2248 0\nsamples equivalent to hO = 0, by assuming an average\nhole content per Cu plane h = hCa = x/2. We identify two regions, as in previous work [19], and our best\nfit to S(h) = \u03b1exp(\u2212\u03b2h) shown in the inset of Fig. 2,\nyields values \u03b1 = 480 \u03bcV/K and \u03b2 = 25 for h > 0.016,\n\u03b1 = 650 \u03bcV/K and \u03b2 = 44 for h < 0.016.\nFigure 2 shows the h values obtained for all our\nY1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y samples (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.14) by comparing their RT Seebeck coefficient S with the calibration\ncurve of the inset in Fig. 2, under the assumption[19, 20]\nof nearly equal mobilities for the two types of holes, hO\nand hCa . [31]\nThe figure shows the well known fact that oxygen does\nnot contribute to hole transfer up to yt \u2248 0.12 \u2212 0.15 (red\narrow), since below this threshold O concentration only\n\nFIG. 2: Total hole content of Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y samples,\nh, obtained from thermopower, vs oxygen content, y, for different Ca families. Inset: calibration of holes h per Cu(2)O2\nlayer from thermopower, S, at T = 290 K for the fully reduced\nsamples.\n\nlocally charge-neutral Cu(1)OCu(1) dimers are formed\n[22], while above yt hole doping increases almost linearly\nwith y, as oxygen ions start forming negatively charged\ntrimers. This is true whatever the calcium content, which\nproves that the oxygen doping mechanism remains nearly\nthe same, with a minor dependence of yt on x (dashed\nline in Fig. 2). The samples (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.08), which\ncollapse on the same curve in Fig. 1, still show a large\ndifference in their total RT mobile hole content h(y) at\nthe critical oxygen concentration yc = 0.3 (blue arrow in\nFig. 2) for the appearance of superconductivity. [32]\nWe also plot in Fig. 3 the reduced critical temperature\nTc /Tc,max versus h, (Tc,max is the maximum transition\ntemperature of each calcium series, at optimum doping\n[23]), showing beyond doubt that the onset of superconductivity does not fall on the same curve as a function\nof the total hole content h. Each series of samples at\nconstant x follows its own curve, contradicting the suggested universal parabolic relation [24] between Tc and\nh, which is not the critical parameter in cuprate superconductivity, as it is often assumed. A similar situation\nis evidenced by NMR[6] in Cax La1.25 Ba1.75\u2212x Cu3 O6+y ,\nwhere the NQR interaction shows that not all doped carriers contribute to the superconducting order parameter.\nThe supercarrier pair density, ns , was directly determined by transverse field (TF) \u03bcSR experiments. We\nmeasured two series with x = 0, x = 0.05, and variable\ny, plus two further samples (x = 0.08, y = 0.43 and\nx = 0.14, y = 0.30). The \u03bcSR experiment were performed on the MUSR spectrometer of the ISIS pulsed\nmuon facility in the transverse field (TF) geometry[25],\nwhere an external magnetic field H is applied perpen-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Scaling of transition temperatures with total holes:\nTc /Tc,max does not scale with total hole content, h.

Field\ncooling the samples in \u03bc0 H = 0.022 T a flux lattice is\nformed, whose field inhomogeneity determines a depolarization rate of the muon spin precession, \u03c3(T ), proportional to the inverse square of the London penetration depth, \u03bbL , hence to the supercarrier density ns [26]:\n\u03c3(T ) \u221d ns (T )/m\u2217 (where m\u2217 is the electron effective\nmass). All samples with y < 0.4 display a coexistence\nof magnetism, below the freezing temperature Tf , and\nsuperconductivity, below Tc . The supercarrier density at\nzero temperature \u03c30 = \u03c3(T = 0) must be obtained by\nextrapolating the data between these two transitions, as\nin Ref. [4, 27].\nThe dependence of Tc on \u03c30 \u221d ns /m\u2217 , shown in\nFig. 4, approaches the characteristic linear Uemura-plot\nbehaviour [28]. The upper axis of the plot represents the\nsupercarrier density ns per CuO2 plane, calculated in the\nclean limit approximation as ns [hole/CuO2 ] \u2248 97500 * \u03c30,\n\u22122\nobtained by combining the relation \u03c30 = 7.58*10\u22128 \u03bbL\nin\n\u22122\n2\n\u2217\nSI units[29]) with \u03bbL = \u03bc0 e ns /m . We assume a doping independent value of the effective mass, m\u2217 = 3me\n[30]. The plot of supercarrier density vs. oxygen content,\nns (y), displayed in the inset of Fig. 4, shows that all samples with calcium content 0 < x < 0.08 collapse on the\nsame line, i.e. the dependence of ns on y is linear. Since\nalso holes injected by oxygen scale with y, hO \u221d y \u2212 yt\n(Fig. 2), the two linear relations imply that only the fraction of holes injected by oxygen, hO , contributes to the\nsupercarrier density for low calcium content.\nSummarizing, our results show that in heavily underdoped compounds additional holes transferred from\nCa participate to the RT normal metal behaviour (thermopower) with hCa \u221d x. Their contribution however dis-\n\nFIG. 4: Scaling of transition temperatures with pair density:\nTc does scale with the \u03bcSR linewidth, \u03c30 , proportional to the\nsupercarrier density, ns . Inset: supercarrier density vs oxygen\ncontent. The samples for 0 < x < 0.08 collapse on the same\nline which yields to ns \u221d y (see text), i.e. only the oxygen\nhole fraction hO contribute to the supercarrier density for low\ncalcium content.\n\nappears from coherent conduction at low temperatures:\nwhereas holes transferred from Cu(1)O chains contribute\nboth to RT normal metal (above the threshold concentration yt \u2248 0.15, hO \u221d y \u2212 yt ) and to superconducting properties (above the critical concentration yc = 0.3,\nns \u221d \u03c30 \u221d T c \u2248 k(y \u2212 yc )), the Ca holes do not take part\nin the latter, as if they were thermally activated.\nNotice that our results do not simply detect a reduction\nof coherent vs. metal hole densities: they furthermore indicate a mechanism of hole tagging, since the hole origin\n(i.e. whether they are transferred from Ca or from O)\ndetermines their behaviour. A direct explanation of this\ntagging may be that, as the perovskitic structure hosts\ninsulating and metallic buffer layers, weakly interacting\nwith each other only through the charge transfer mechanism, a further semiconducting component may come\ninto play in YBa2 Cu3 O6+y . The interplay of semiconducting and metallic bands is however far from trivial\nwhen the latter is driven towards non Fermi liquid behaviour, as it is the case in underdoped cuprates.\nIn particular it is difficult to reconcile this tagging\nwith simple one-band Hubbard models,[1], and more realistic correlated-electron band structure calculations are\ncalled for. Whether these may be based on perturbative\nschemes (e.g. LDA+U [14]) or on more sophisticated\nvariations of the Hubbard model is an open question, but\nit is clear that material-specific predictions must consider\nmultiple bands.\nWe further argue that our results have a consequence\n\n\f4\non the broader understanding of cuprates. The activated transport that we indirectly deduce in Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y is a generic feature of the extremely underdoped regime in compounds where cation substitution is the only doping mechanism. For instance Hall\neffect measurements[11] identify similar activated mobile\nholes in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 . Importantly, it was pointed\nout that the activation energy is proportional to x\u22121\nand that this matches also quantitatively the pseudogap\nfeatures[12] determined by ARPES. Recent theoretical\ncalculations[17] show that a two-band Hubbard model\nmay yield two distinct excitations that fit this pictures,\nproviding a non trivial origin for the activated behaviour.\nA straightforward conjecture is that for all cuprates\nthe two features, namely the activated behaviour and\nthe pseudogap excitations, are two sides of the same\ncoin. If we assume this conjecture to be valid for the\nY1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6+y system as well, our results suggest that pseudogap excitations are specifically related\nto Ca-tagged doping, a charge transfer mechanism which\nimplies local Jahn-Teller distortion, i.e the presence of\nmore than one band.

In particular Fig. 2 is self similar if one assumes a uniform transfer rate h = kx, with a different k\ncoefficient.\n[32] A slight reduction of the h(y) slope with increasing x\nabove yt , has more probably to do with different mobilities of hO and hCa , rather than with the above mentioned\ntrimer formation threshold.\n\n\f"}
