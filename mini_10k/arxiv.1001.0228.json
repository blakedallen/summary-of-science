Dg categories enhance and solve many of the technical problems\ninherent to triangulated categories; see Keller's ICM adress [30]. In non-commutative\nalgebraic geometry in the sense of Bondal, Drinfeld, Kapranov, Kontsevich, To\u00ebn, Van\nden Bergh, . . . [3, 4, 16, 17, 33, 34, 35, 48], they are considered as dg-enhancements\nof derived categories of (quasi-)coherent sheaves on a hypothetic non-commutative\nspace.\nLocalizing invariants. - All the classical (functorial) invariants, such as\nHochschild homology, cyclic homology and its variants (periodic, negative, . . .),\nalgebraic K-theory, and even topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic\nhomology (see [45]), extend naturally from k-algebras to dg categories. In order\nto study all these classical invariants simultaneously, the second named author\nintroduced in [42] the notion of localizing invariant. This notion, that we now\nrecall, makes use of the language of Grothendieck derivators [28], a formalism which\nallows us to state and prove precise universal properties; consult Appendix A. Let\nL : HO(dgcat) \u2192 D be a morphism of derivators, from the derivator associated to\nthe Morita model structure of dg categories (see \u00a72.3), to a triangulated derivator\n(in practice, D will be the derivator associated to a stable model category M, and\nL will come from a functor dgcat \u2192 M which sends derived Morita equivalences to\nweak equivalences in M). We say that L is a localizing invariant (see Definition 7.3)\nif it preserves filtered homotopy colimits as well as the terminal object, and sends\nDrinfeld exact sequences of dg categories\nA \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 C\n\n7\u2192 L(A) \u2212\u2192 L(B) \u2212\u2192 L(C) \u2212\u2192 L(A)[1]\n\nto distinguished triangles in the base category D(e) of D. Thanks to the work\nof Keller [31, 32], Schlichting [41], Thomason-Trobaugh [47], and BlumbergMandell [2], all the mentioned invariants satisfy localization(1), and so give rise to\nlocalizing invariants. In [42], the second named author proved that there exists a\nlocalizing invariant\nloc\nUdg\n: HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 Motloc\ndg ,\n\nwith values in a strong triangulated derivator (see \u00a7A.3), such that given any strong\ntriangulated derivator D, we have an induced equivalence of categories\n\u223c\n\nloc \u2217\n(Udg\n) : Hom! (Motloc\ndg , D) \u2212\u2192 Homloc (HO(dgcat), D) .\n(1) In\n\nthe case of algebraic K-theory we consider its non-connective version.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n3\n\nThe left-hand side denotes the category of homotopy colimit preserving morphisms\nof derivators, and the right-hand side the category of localizing invariants.\nloc\nBecause of this universality property, which is a reminiscence of motives, Udg\nloc\nis called the universal localizing invariant, Motdg the localizing motivator, and the\nbase category Motloc\ndg (e) of the localizing motivator the category of non-commutative\nmotives over k.\nSymmetric monoidal structure. - The purpose of this article is to develop a new\ningredient in the theory of non-commutative motives: symmetric monoidal structures.\nThe tensor product extends naturally from k-algebras to dg categories, giving rise to\na symmetric monoidal structure on HO(dgcat); see Theorem 2.23. Therefore, it is\nnatural to consider localizing invariants which are symmetric monoidal. Examples\ninclude Hochschild homology and the mixed and periodic complex constructions; see\nExamples 7.9-7.11. The main result of this article is the following.\nTheorem 0.1. - (see Theorem 7.5) The localizing motivator Motloc\ndg carries a\nL\ncanonical symmetric monoidal structure \u2212 \u2297 \u2212, making the universal localizing inloc\nvariant Udg\nsymmetric monoidal. Moreover, this tensor product preserves homotopy\ncolimits in each variable and is characterized by the following universal property:\ngiven any strong triangulated derivator D, endowed with a monoidal structure which\npreserves homotopy colimits, we have an induced equivalence of categories\n\u223c\n\n\u2297\nloc\nloc \u2217\n(Udg\n) : Hom\u2297\n! (Motdg , D) \u2212\u2192 Homloc (HO(dgcat), D) ,\n\nwhere the left-hand side stands for the category of symmetric monoidal homotopy\ncolimit preserving morphisms of derivators, while the right-hand side stands for the\ncategory symmetric monoidal morphisms of derivators which are also localizing invariants; see \u00a7A.5. Furthermore, Motloc\ndg admits an explicit symmetric monoidal Quillen\nmodel.\nThe proof of Theorem 0.1 is based on an alternative description of Motloc\ndg , with two\ncomplementary aspects: a constructive one, and another given by universal properties.\nThe constructive aspect, i.e. the construction of an explicit symmetric monoidal\nQuillen model for Motloc\ndg , is described in the main body of the text. The key starting point is the fact that homotopically finitely presented dg categories are stable\nunder derived tensor product; see Theorem 3.4. This allows us to obtain a small\nsymmetric monoidal category which \"generates\" the entire Morita homotopy category of dg categories. Starting from this small monoidal category, we then construct\na specific symmetric monoidal Quillen model for each one of the derivators used in\nthe construction of Motloc\ndg ; see \u00a77.1.\nThe characterization of Motloc\ndg by its universal property (as stated in Theorem 0.1),\nrelies on general results and constructions in the theory of Grothendieck derivators,\nand is described in the appendix. We develop some general results concerning the\nbehavior of monoidal structures under classical operations : Kan extension (see Theorem A.3), left Bousfield localization (see Proposition A.9) and stabilization (see\n\n\f4\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nTheorem A.15). Using these general results, we then characterize by a precise universal property each one of the Quillen models used in the construction of the new\nsymmetric monoidal Quillen model for Motloc\ndg ; see \u00a77.1.\nLet us now describe some applications of Theorem 0.1.\nNon-connective K-theory. - As mentioned above, non-connective algebraic Ktheory IK(\u2212) is an example of a localizing invariant. In [11] the authors proved that\nloc\nthis invariant becomes co-representable in Motloc\ndg (e) by the unit object Udg (k) (where\nk corresponds to k, seen as a dg category with one object). In other words, given any\ndg category A, we have a natural isomorphism in the stable homotopy category of\nspectra :\n(0.0.1)\n\nloc\nloc\nRHom( Udg\n(k), Udg\n(A) ) \u2243 IK(A) .\n\nA fundamental problem of the theory of non-commutative motives is the computation\nof the (spectra of) morphisms in the category of non-commutative motives between\nany two objects. Using the monoidal structure of Theorem 0.1 we extend the above\nnatural isomorphism (0.0.1), and thus obtain a partial solution to this problem.\nTheorem 0.2. - (see Theorem 8.2) Let B be a saturated dg category in the sense of\nKontsevich, i.e. its complexes of morphisms are perfect and B is perfect as a bimodule\nover itself; see Definition 4.1. Then, for every small dg category A, we have a natural\nisomorphism in the stable homotopy category of spectra\nloc\nloc\nRHom( Udg\n(B), Udg\n(A) ) \u2243 IK(rep(B, A)) ,\n\nwhere rep(\u2212, \u2212) denotes the internal Hom-functor in the Morita homotopy category\nof dg categories; see \u00a72.4.\nGiven a quasi-compact and separated k-scheme X, there is a natural dg category\nperf(X) which enhances the category of perfect complexes (i.e. of compact objects)\nin the (unbounded) derived category Dqcoh (X) of quasi-coherent sheaves on X; see\nExample 4.5. Moreover, when X is smooth and proper, the dg category perf(X) is a\nsaturated dg category. In this geometrical situation, we have the following computation.\nProposition 0.3. - (see Proposition 8.3) Given smooth and proper k-schemes X\nand Y , we have a natural isomorphism in the stable homotopy category of spectra\nloc\nloc\nRHom( Udg\n(perf(X)), Udg\n(perf(Y )) ) \u2243 IK(X \u00d7 Y ) ,\n\nwhere IK(X \u00d7 Y ) denotes the non-connective algebraic K-theory spectrum of X \u00d7 Y .\nKontsevich's category of non-commutative mixed motives. - In his noncommutative algebraic geometry program [33, 34, 35], Kontsevich introduced the\ncategory KMMk of non-commutative mixed motives; see \u00a78.2. Roughly, KMMk is\nobtained by taking a formal Karoubian triangulated envelope of the category of saturated dg categories (with algebraic K-theory of bimodules as morphism sets). Using\nTheorem 0.2, we prove the following result.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n5\n\nProposition 0.4. - (see Proposition 8.5) There is a natural fully-faithful embedding\n(enriched over spectra) of Kontsevich's category KMMk of non-commutative mixed\nmotives into the base category Motloc\ndg (e) of the localizing motivator. The essential image is the thick triangulated subcategory spanned by motives of saturated dg categories.\nNote that, in contrast with Kontsevich's ad hoc definition, the category Motloc\ndg (e)\nof non-commutative motives is defined purely in terms of precise universal properties.\nChern characters. - Let\nE : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 D\nbe a symmetric monoidal localizing invariant. Thanks to Theorem 0.1 there is a\n(unique) symmetric monoidal homotopy colimit preserving morphism of derivators\nEgm which makes the diagram\n\nloc\nUdg\n\nE\n\n/; D\nww\nw\nw\nww\nwwEgm\nw\nw\n\nHO(dgcat)\n\u000f\nMotloc\ndg\n\ncommute (up to unique 2-isomorphism). We call Egm the geometric realization of E .\nIf E (k) \u2243 1 denotes the unit of D, we can also associate to E its absolute realization\nEabs := RHomD (1, Egm (\u2212))\n\n(see Definition 8.6)\n\nProposition 0.5. - (see Proposition 8.7) The geometric realization of E induces a\ncanonical Chern character\nloc\nIK(\u2212) \u21d2 RHom(1, E(\u2212)) \u2243 Eabs (Udg\n(\u2212)) .\nloc\nHere, IK(\u2212) and Eabs (Udg\n(\u2212)) are two morphisms of derivators defined on HO(dgcat).\n\nLet A be a small dg category. When E is given by the mixed complex construction\nloc\n(see Example 7.10), the absolute realization of Udg\n(A) identifies with the negative\n\u2212\ncyclic homology complex HC (A) of A. Therefore by Proposition 0.5, we obtain a\ncanonical Chern character\nIK(\u2212) \u21d2 HC \u2212 (\u2212)\nfrom non-connective K-theory to negative cyclic homology; see Example 8.10. When\nE is given by the composition of the mixed complex construction with the periodizaloc\n(A) identifies with\ntion procedure (see Example 7.11), the absolute realization of Udg\nthe periodic cyclic homology complex HP(A) of A. Therefore by Proposition 0.5, we\nobtain a canonical Chern character\nIK(\u2212) \u21d2 HP(\u2212)\nfrom non-connective K-theory to periodic cyclic homology; see Example 8.11.\n\n\f6\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nTo\u00ebn's secondary K-theory. - In his sheaf categorification program [50, 52],\nTo\u00ebn introduced a \"categorified\" version of algebraic K-theory, named secondary K(2)\ntheory. Given a commutative ring k, the secondary K-theory ring K0 (k) of k is\nroughly the quotient of the free abelian group on derived Morita isomorphism classes\nof saturated dg categories, by the relations [B] = [A] + [C] coming from Drinfeld\nexact sequences A \u2192 B \u2192 C. The multiplication is induced from the derived tensor\nproduct; see \u00a78.4. As To\u00ebn pointed out in [50], one of the motivations for the study of\nthis secondary K-theory is its expected connection with an hypothetical Grothendieck\nring of motives in the non-commutative setting. Thanks to the monoidal structure of\nTheorem 0.1 we are now able to make this connection precise.\nDefinition 0.6. - (see Definition 8.16) Given a commutative ring k, the Grothendieck\nring K0 (k) of non-commutative motives over k is the Grothendieck ring of Kontsevich\nmixed motives (i.e. of the thick triangulated subcategory of Motloc\ndg (e) generated by\nloc\nthe objects Udg\n(A), where A runs over the family of saturated dg categories).\nKontsevich's saturated dg categories can be characterized conceptually as the dualizable objects in the Morita homotopy category; see Theorem 4.8. Therefore, since\nloc\nthe universal localizing invariant Udg\nis symmetric monoidal we obtain a ring homomorphism\n(2)\n\n\u03a6(k) : K0 (k) \u2212\u2192 K0 (k) .\nMoreover, the Grothendieck ring of Definition 0.6 is non-trivial (see Remark 8.17),\nfunctorial in k (see Remark 8.18), and the ring homomorphism \u03a6(k) is functorial in\nk and surjective \"up to cofinality\" (see Remark 8.19). Furthermore, any realization\n(2)\n(2)\nof K0 (k) (i.e. ring homomorphism K0 (k) \u2192 R), which is induced from a symmetric monoidal localizing invariant, factors through \u03a6(k). An interesting example is\nprovided by To\u00ebn's rank map\n(2)\n\nrk0 : K0 (k) \u2212\u2192 K0 (k)\n\n(see Remark 8.19).\n\nEuler characteristic. - Recall that, in any symmetric monoidal category, we have\nthe notion of Euler characteristic \u03c7(X) of a dualizable object X (see Definition 8.20).\nIn the symmetric monoidal category of non-commutative motives we have the following computation.\nProposition 0.7. - (see Proposition 8.24) Let A be a saturated dg category. Then,\nloc\n\u03c7(Udg\n(A)) is the element of the Grothendieck group K0 (k) which is associated to the\n(perfect) Hochschild homology complex HH (A) of A.\nWhen k is the field of complex numbers, the Grothendieck ring K0 (C) is naturally\nisomorphic to Z and the Hochschild homology of a smooth and proper k-scheme X\nagrees with the Hodge cohomology H \u2217 (X, \u03a9\u2217X ) of X. Therefore, when we work over\nC, and if perf(X) denotes the (saturated) dg category of perfect complexes over X,\nloc\nthe Euler characteristic of Udg\n(perf(X)) is the classical Euler characteristic of X.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments : The authors are very grateful to Bertrand To\u00ebn for sharing\nhis insights on saturated dg categories and to Maxim Kontsevich for comments on a\nprevious version which motivated the creation of subsection 8.3. The second named\nauthor would like also to thank Paul Balmer and Christian Haesemeyer for some\nconversations. This article was initiated at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris. The\nauthors would like to thank this institution for its hospitality and stimulating working\nenvironment.\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1. Notations. - Throughout the article we will work over a fixed commutative\nand unital base ring k.\nWe will denote by C(k) be the category of (unbounded) complexes of k-modules;\nsee [24, \u00a72.3]. We will use co-homological notation, i.e. the differential increases the\ndegree. The category C(k) is a symmetric monoidal model category (see [24, Definition 4.2.6]), where one uses the projective model structure for which weak equivalences\nare quasi-isomorphisms and fibrations are surjections; see [24, Proposition 4.2.13].\nThe category of sets will be denoted by Set, the category of simplicial sets by sSet,\nand the category of pointed simplicial sets by sSet\u2022 ; see [20, \u00a7I]. The categories sSet\nand sSet\u2022 are symmetric monoidal model categories; see [20, Proposition 4.2.8]. The\nweak equivalences are the maps whose geometric realization is a weak equivalence of\ntopological spaces, the fibrations are the Kan-fibrations, and the cofibrations are the\ninclusion maps.\nWe will denote by SpN the category of spectra and by Sp\u03a3 the category of symmetric\nspectra (of pointed simplicial sets); see [27].\nFinally, the adjunctions will be displayed vertically with the left (resp. right)\nadjoint on the left- (resp. right-) hand side.\n1.2. Triangulated categories. - Throughout the article we will use the language\nof triangulated categories. The reader unfamiliar with this language is invited to\nconsult Neeman's book [39] or Verdier's original monograph [53]. Recall from [39,\nDefinition 4.2.7] that given a triangulated category T admitting arbitrary small coproducts, an object G in T is called compact if for each family {Yi }i\u2208I of objects in\nT , the canonical morphism\nM\nM\n\u223c\nHomT (G, Yi ) \u2212\u2192 HomT (G,\nYi )\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nis invertible. We will denote by Tc the category of compact objects in T .\n1.3. Quillen model categories. - Throughout the article we will use freely the\nlanguage of Quillen model categories. The reader unfamiliar with this language is\ninvited to consult Goerss & Jardine [20], Hirschhorn [23], Hovey [24], or Quillen's\n\n\f8\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\noriginal monograph [40]. Given a model category M, we will denote by Ho(M) its\nhomotopy category and by\nMap(\u2212, \u2212) : Ho(M)op \u00d7 Ho(M) \u2212\u2192 Ho(sSet)\nits homotopy function complex; see [23, Definition 17.4.1].\n1.4. Grothendieck derivators. - Throughout the article we will use the language of Grothendieck derivators. Derivators allow us to state and prove precise\nuniversal properties and to dispense with many of the technical problems one faces\nin using Quillen model categories. Since this language may be less familiar to the\nreader, we revise it in the appendix. Given a model category M, we will denote by\nHO(M) its associated derivator; see \u00a7A.2. Any triangulated derivator D is canonically\nenriched over spectra; see \u00a7A.9. We will denote by RHomD (X, Y ) the spectrum of\nmaps from X to Y in D. When there is no ambiguity, we will write RHom(X, Y )\ninstead of RHomD (X, Y ).\n2. Background on dg categories\nIn this section we collect and recall the notions and results on the (homotopy)\ntheory of dg categories which will be used throughout the article; see [43, 44, 48].\nAt the end of the section we prove a new result: the derivator associated to the\nMorita model structure carries a symmetric monoidal structure; see Theorem 2.23.\nThis result is the starting point of the article, since it allow us to define symmetric\nmonoidal localizing invariants; see Definition 7.6.\nDefinition 2.1. - A small dg category A is a C(k)-category; see [5, Definition 6.2.1].\nRecall that this consists of the following data :\n- a set of objects obj(A) (usually denoted by A itself);\n- for each ordered pair of objects (x, y) in A, a complex of k-modules A(x, y);\n- for each ordered triple of objects (x, y, z) in A, a composition morphism in C(k)\nA(y, z) \u2297 A(x, y) \u2212\u2192 A(x, z) ,\nsatisfying the usual associativity condition;\n- for each object x in A, a morphism k \u2192 A(x, x), satisfying the usual unit\ncondition with respect to the above composition.\nDefinition 2.2. - A dg functor F : A \u2192 B is a C(k)-functor; see [5, Definition 6.2.3]. Recall that this consists of the following data :\n- a map of sets F : obj(A) \u2212\u2192 obj(B);\n- for each ordered pair of objects (x, y) in A, a morphism in C(k)\nF (x, y) : A(x, y) \u2212\u2192 B(F x, F y) ,\nsatisfying the usual unit and associativity conditions.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n9\n\nNotation 2.3. - We denote by dgcat the category of small dg categories.\n2.1. Dg cells. -\n(i) Let k be the dg category with one object \u2217 and such that k(\u2217, \u2217) := k (in degree\nzero). Note that given a small dg category B, there is a bijection between the\nset of dg functors from k to B and the set of objects of B.\n(ii) For n \u2208 Z, let S n be the complex k[n] (with k concentrated in degree n) and Dn\nthe mapping cone on the identity of S n\u22121 . We denote by S(n) the dg category\nwith two objects 1 and 2 such that S(n)(1, 1) = k , S(n)(2, 2) = k , S(n)(2, 1) =\n0, S(n)(1, 2) = S n and composition given by multiplication. We denote by D(n)\nthe dg category with two objects 3 and 4 such that D(n)(3, 3) = k , D(n)(4, 4) =\nk , D(n)(4, 3) = 0 , D(n)(3, 4) = Dn and composition given by multiplication.\n(iii) For n \u2208 Z, let \u03b9(n) : S(n \u2212 1) \u2192 D(n) be the dg functor that sends 1 to 3, 2 to\n4 and S n\u22121 to Dn by the identity on k in degree n \u2212 1 :\nS(n \u2212 1)\n\n\u03b9(n)\n\nk\n\n1\n\nk\n\n\u0005\n\u001f\n\n/\n\n3\n\nincl\n\nS n\u22121\n\n\u000f\n2\nE\nk\n\nS n\u22121\n\n/ D(n)\n\n\u001f\n/\n\n/\n\n\u0005\nDn\n\n\u000f\n4\nE\n\nwhere\n\n0\n\u000f\n0\n\u000f\nk\n\u000f\n0\n\nincl\n\nid\n\n/ Dn\n\n/0\n\u000f\n/k\n\u000f id\n/k\n\u000f\n/0\n\n(degree n\u22121)\n\nk\n\nNotation 2.4. - Let I be the set consisting of the dg functors {\u03b9(n)}n\u2208Z and the\ndg functor \u2205 \u2192 k (where the empty dg category \u2205 is the initial object in dgcat).\nDefinition 2.5. - A dg category A is called a dg cell (resp. a finite dg cell ) if the\nunique dg functor \u2205 \u2192 A can be expressed as a transfinite (resp. finite) composition\nof pushouts of dg functors in I; see [23, Definition 10.5.8(2)].\n2.2. Dg modules. - Let A be a small (fixed) dg category.\nDefinition 2.6. -\n- The category H0 (A) has the same objects as A and morphisms given by H0 (A)(x, y) := H0 (A(x, y)), where H0 (\u2212) denotes the 0-th\nco-homology group functor.\n- The opposite dg category Aop of A has the same objects as A and complexes of\nmorphisms given by Aop (x, y) := A(y, x).\n- A right dg A-module M (or simply a A-module) is a dg functor M : Aop \u2192 Cdg (k)\nwith values in the dg category Cdg (k) of complexes of k-modules.\n\n\f10\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nWe denote by C(A) the category of right dg A-modules. Its objects are the right\ndg A-modules and its morphisms are the natural transformations of dg functors; see\n[30, \u00a72.3]. The differential graded structure of Cdg (k) makes C(A) naturally into a\ndg category; see [30, \u00a73.1] for details. We denote by Cdg (A) this dg category of\nright dg A-modules. Recall from [30, Theorem 3.2] that C(A) carries a standard\nprojective model structure. A morphism M \u2192 M \u2032 in C(A) is a weak equivalence,\nresp. a fibration, if for any object x in A, the induced morphism M (x) \u2192 M \u2032 (x) is\na weak equivalence, resp. a fibration, in the projective model structure on C(k). In\nparticular, every object is fibrant. Moreover, the dg category Cdg (A) endowed with\nthis model structure is a C(k)-model category in the sense of [24, Definition 4.2.18].\nNotation 2.7. -\n- We denote by Ddg (A) the full dg subcategory of fibrant and\ncofibrant objects in Cdg (A).\n- We denote by D(A) the derived category of A, i.e. the localization of C(A) with\nrespect to the class of weak equivalences. Note that D(A) is a triangulated\ncategory with arbitrary small coproducts. Recall from \u00a71.2 that we denote by\nDc (A) the category of compact objects in D(A).\nSince Cdg (A) is a C(k)-model category, [48, Proposition 3.5] implies that we have\na natural equivalence of (triangulated) categories\nH0 (Ddg (A)) \u2243 D(A) .\n\n(2.2.1)\nWe denote by\n\nh : A \u2212\u2192 Cdg (A)\n\nx 7\u2192 A(\u2212, x) ,\n\nthe classical Yoneda dg functor; see [5, \u00a76.3]. Since the A-modules A(\u2212, x), x in A,\nare fibrant and cofibrant in the projective model structure, the Yoneda functor factors\nthrough the inclusion Ddg (A) \u2282 Cdg (A). Thanks to the above equivalence (2.2.1), we\nobtain an induced fully-faithful functor\nh : H0 (A) \u0592\u2192 D(A)\n\nx 7\u2192 A(\u2212, x) .\n\nFinally, let F : A \u2192 B be a dg functor. As shown in [48, \u00a73] it induces a restriction/extension of scalars Quillen adjunction (on the left-hand side)\nC(B)\nO\nF!\n\nF\u2217\n\n\u000f\nC(A)\n\nD(B)\nO\nLF!\n\nF\u2217\n\n\u000f\nD(A) ,\n\nwhich can be naturally derived (on the right-hand side).\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n11\n\n2.3. Morita model structure. -\nDefinition 2.8. - A dg functor F : A \u2192 B is a called a derived Morita equivalence\n\u223c\nif the restriction of scalars functor F \u2217 : D(B) \u2192 D(A) is an equivalence of triangulated\ncategories. Equivalently, F is a derived Morita equivalence if the extension of scalars\n\u223c\nfunctor LF! : D(A) \u2192 D(B) is an equivalence of triangulated categories.\nTheorem 2.9. - The category dgcat carries a cofibrantly generated Quillen model\nstructure (called the Morita model structure), whose weak equivalences are the derived Morita equivalences. Moreover, its set of generating cofibrations is the set I of\nNotation 2.4.\n\u221a\nProof. - See [43, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 5.3].\nNotation 2.10. - We denote by Hmo the homotopy category hence obtained.\nRecall from [43, Remarque 5.4] that the fibrant objects of the Morita model structure (called the Morita fibrant dg categories) are the dg categories A for which the\nimage of the induced functor\nh : H0 (A) \u0592\u2192 D(A)\n\nx 7\u2192 A(\u2212, x)\n\nis stable under (co-)suspensions, cones and direct factors.\n2.4. Monoidal structure. -\nDefinition 2.11. - Let A1 and A2 be small dg categories. The tensor product\nA1 \u2297 A2 of A1 with A2 is defined as follows: the set of objects of A1 \u2297 A2 is obj(A1 ) \u00d7\nobj(A2 ) and given objects (x, x\u2032 ) and (y, y \u2032 ) in A1 \u2297 A2 , we set\n(A1 \u2297 A2 )((x, x\u2032 ), (y, y \u2032 )) = A1 (x, y) \u2297 A2 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) .\n\nRemark 2.12. - The tensor product of dg categories gives rise to a symmetric\nmonoidal structure on dgcat, with unit object the dg category k (see \u00a72.1). Moreover,\nthis model structure is easily seen to be closed. However, the model structure of\nTheorem 2.9 endowed with this symmetric monoidal structure is not a symmetric\nmonoidal model category, as the tensor product of two cofibrant objects in dgcat is\nnot cofibrant in general; see [48, \u00a74]. Nevertheless, the tensor product can be derived\ninto a bifunctor\n\u2212 \u2297L \u2212 : Hmo \u00d7 Hmo \u2212\u2192 Hmo\n\n(A1 , A2 ) 7\u2192 Q(A1 ) \u2297 A2 =: A1 \u2297L A2 ,\n\nwhere Q(A1 ) is a Morita cofibrant resolution of A1 .\nNow, let B and A be small dg categories. For any object x in B, we have a dg\nfunctor A \u2192 B op \u2297 A. It sends an object y in A to (x, y) and for each ordered pair of\nobjects (y, z) in A, the morphism in C(k)\nA(y, z) \u2212\u2192 (B op \u2297 A)((x, y), (x, z)) = B op (x, x) \u2297 A(y, z)\n\n\f12\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nis given by the tensor product of the unit morphism k \u2192 B op (x, x) with the identity\nmorphism on A(y, z). Take a Morita cofibrant resolution Q(B op ) of B op with the same\nset of objects; see [48, Proposition 2.3(2)]. Since B op and Q(B op) have the same set\nof objects, one sees that for any object x in B, we have a dg functor\n(2.4.1)\n\nix : A \u2212\u2192 Q(B op) \u2297 A =: B op \u2297L A .\n\nDefinition 2.13. - Let A be a small dg category. A A-module M is called perfect\nif it is compact as an object in the derived category D(A). We denote by Cdg (A)pe\nthe dg category of perfect A-modules, and put\nperf(A) = Cdg (A)pe \u2229 Ddg (A) .\n\nWe thus have an equivalence of triangulated categories\nH0 (perf(A)) \u2243 Dc (A) .\n\nLet B and A be small dg categories. A (B op \u2297L A)-module X is said to be locally perfect\nover B if, for any object x in B, the A-module i\u2217x (X) (see (2.4.1) and \u00a72.2) is perfect.\nWe denote by Cdg (B op \u2297L A)lpe the dg category of locally perfect (B op \u2297L A)-modules\nover B, and put\nrep(B, A) = Cdg (B op \u2297L A)lpe \u2229 Ddg (B op \u2297L A) .\n\nNote that H0 (rep(B, A)) is canonically equivalent to the full triangulated subcategory\nof D(B op \u2297L A) spanned by the locally perfect (B op \u2297L A)-modules over B.\nRemark 2.14. - For any dg category A, the Yoneda embedding h : A \u2192 perf(A)\nis a derived Morita equivalence, and perf(A) is Morita fibrant. This construction thus\nprovides us a canonical fibrant replacement functor for the Morita model structure.\nTheorem 2.15 (To\u00ebn). - Given small dg categories B and A, we have a natural\nbijection\nHomHmo (B, A) \u2243 Iso H0 (rep(B, A))\n\n(where Iso C stands for the set of isomorphism classes of objects in C). Moreover,\ngiven small dg categories A1 , A2 , and A3 , the composition in Hmo corresponds to the\nderived tensor product of bimodules :\nIso H0 (rep(A1 , A2 )) \u00d7 Iso H0 (rep(A2 , A3 ))\n([X], [Y ])\n\n\u2212\u2192 Iso H0 (rep(A1 , A3 ))\n7\u2212\u2192\n[X \u2297LA2 Y ] .\n\nProof. - See [48, Corollary 4.8] and [43, Remarque 5.11].\n\n\u221a\n\nTheorem 2.16 (To\u00ebn). - The derived tensor product \u2212 \u2297L \u2212 on Hmo admits the\nbifunctor\nrep(\u2212, \u2212) : Hmoop \u00d7 Hmo \u2212\u2192 Hmo\n\nas an internal Hom-functor.\n\nProof. - See [48, Theorem 6.1] and [43, Remarque 5.11].\n\n\u221a\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n13\n\nCorollary 2.17. - Given small dg categories A1 , A2 and A3 , we have a natural\nisomorphism in Ho(sSet)\n(2.4.2)\n\nMap(A1 \u2297L A2 , A3 ) \u2243 Map(A1 , rep(A2 , A3 )) .\n\nProof. - See [48, Corollary 6.4] and [43, Remarque 5.11].\n\n\u221a\n\nRemark 2.18. - Observe that, when B = k, the dg category B op \u2297L A identifies\nwith A, which gives a natural isomorphism in Hmo :\n(2.4.3)\n\nrep(k, A) \u2243 perf(A) .\n\nWe finish this section by showing how to endow the derivator associated to the\nMorita model structure on dg categories with a symmetric monoidal structure; see\nTheorem 2.23. Recall from \u00a72.4 that the Morita model structure is not a monoidal\nmodel structure and so we cannot apply the general Proposition A.2. We sidestep\nthis difficulty by introducing the notion of k-flat dg category.\nDefinition 2.19. - A complex of k-modules is called k-flat if for any acyclic complex N , the complex M \u2297 N is acyclic.\nA dg category is called k-flat if for each ordered pair of objects (x, y) in A, the\ncomplex A(x, y) is k-flat.\nNotation 2.20. - We denote by dgcatflat the category of k-flat dg categories.\nRemark 2.21. - Clearly dgcatflat is a full subcategory of dgcat. Since complexes of\nk-flat modules are stable under tensor product, the category dgcatflat is a symmetric\nmonoidal full subcategory of dgcat (see \u00a72.4). Moreover, the tensor product\n\u2212 \u2297 \u2212 : dgcatflat \u00d7 dgcatflat \u2212\u2192 dgcatflat\npreserves derived Morita equivalences (in both variables).\nNotation 2.22. - We denote by HO(dgcat) the derivator associated to the Morita\nmodel structure on dg categories; see Theorem 2.9.\nTheorem 2.23. - The derivator HO(dgcat) carries a symmetric monoidal structure \u2212 \u2297L \u2212; see \u00a7A.5. Moreover, the induced symmetric monoidal structure on\nHO(dgcat)(e) = Hmo coincides with the one described in Remark 2.12.\nProof. - Let HO(dgcatflat ) = dgcatflat [Mor \u22121 ] be the prederivator associated to the\nclass Mor of derived Morita equivalences in dgcatflat ; see \u00a7A.1. Since dgcatflat is\na symmetric monoidal category, and the tensor product preserves the class Mor,\ni.e. Mor \u2297 Mor \u2282 Mor, the prederivator HO(dgcatflat ) carries a natural symmetric\nmonoidal structure; see \u00a7A.5. Now, choose a functorial Morita cofibrant resolution\nfunctor\nQ : dgcat \u2212\u2192 dgcat\nQ \u21d2 Id .\n\n\fD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\n14\n\nThanks to [48, Proposition 2.3(3)] every cofibrant dg category is k-flat, and so we\nobtain functors\ni : dgcatflat \u0592\u2192 dgcat\n\nQ : dgcat \u2212\u2192 dgcatflat\n\nand natural transformations\n(2.4.4)\n\ni \u25e6 Q \u21d2 Id\n\nQ \u25e6 i \u21d2 Id .\n\nSince the functors i and Q preserve derived Morita equivalences and the above natural\ntransformations (2.4.4) are objectwise derived Morita equivalences, we obtain by 2functoriality (see \u00a7A.1) morphisms of derivators\ni : HO(dgcatflat ) \u2212\u2192 HO(dgcat)\n\nQ : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 HO(dgcatflat )\n\nwhich are quasi-inverse to each other. Using this equivalence of derivators, we transport the monoidal structure from HO(dgcatflat ) to HO(dgcat). The fact that the\ninduced monoidal structure on HO(dgcat)(e) = Hmo coincides with the one described\n\u221a\nin Remark 2.12 is now clear.\nProposition 2.24. - The tensor product on HO(dgcat) of Theorem 2.23 preserves\nhomotopy colimits in each variable.\n\u221a\nProof. - This follows immediately from Corollary 2.17.\n3. Homotopically finitely presented dg categories\nIn this section we give a new characterization of homotopically finitely presented\ndg categories; see Theorem 3.3(3). Using this new characterization we show that\nhomotopically finitely presented dg categories are stable under derived tensor product;\nsee Theorem 3.4. This stability result will play a key role in the construction of a\nsymmetric monoidal model structure on the category of non-commutative motives;\nsee Section 7.\nProposition 3.1. - For any small dg category A and n \u2208 Z, we have natural isomorphisms in Hmo\nS(n)op \u2297 A \u2243 S(n)op \u2297L A \u2243 rep(S(n), A) .\nProof. - Since S(n) \u2243 S(n)op is cofibrant, we obtain the following isomorphism in\nHmo\nS(n)op \u2297L A \u2243 S(n)op \u2297 A .\n\nBy construction, the dg category S(n) is also locally perfect, i.e. its complexes of\nmorphisms are perfect complexes of k-modules; see [51, Definition 2.4(1)]. We obtain\nthen by [51, Lemma 2.8] the following inclusion\nS(n)op \u2297 A \u2243 perf(S(n)op \u2297L A) \u2282 rep(S(n), A) .\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n15\n\nLet us now prove the converse inclusion. Observe that we have two natural dg functors\ni1 : A \u2212\u2192 S(n)op \u2297 A\nx 7\u2212\u2192\n(1, x)\n\ni2 : A\nx\n\n\u2212\u2192\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nS(n)op \u2297 A\n,\n(2, x)\n\nand the category of (S(n)op \u2297 A)-modules identifies with the category of morphisms\nof degree n in C(A), i.e. to the category of triples (M, M \u2032 , f ), where M and M \u2032 are Amodules, and f : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 [n] is a morphism of A-modules. Under this identification,\nwe obtain the following extension of scalars functors (see \u00a72.2) :\n(i1 )! : C(A) \u2212\u2192 C(S(n)op \u2297 A)\nop\n\n(i2 )! : C(A) \u2212\u2192 C(S(n)\n\n\u2297 A)\n\nM 7\u2212\u2192 (M, M [\u2212n], 1M )\n\nM 7\u2212\u2192 (0, M, 0) .\n\nNow, let X be an object in rep(S(n), A). Note that X corresponds to a cofibration\nf :M /\n\n/ M \u2032 [n]\n\nin C(A) between cofibrant and perfect A-modules (see Definition 2.13). Consider the\nfollowing short exact sequence of morphisms of A-modules\n(3.0.5)\nf\n\n(M [\u2212n])[n] = M /\nO\n1M\n\n/ M \u2032 [n]\nO\n\n/ coker(f ) = (coker(f )[\u2212n])[n]\nO\n\nf\n\nO\nM\n\nM\n\n/0\n\nwhere coker(f ) denotes the cokernel of f in the category C(A). Since M and M \u2032 [n]\nare cofibrant and perfect A-modules, and f is a cofibration, the A-module coker(f )\nis also cofibrant and perfect. Perfect modules are stable under suspension, and so\ncoker(f )[\u2212n] is a perfect (and cofibrant) A-module. We have natural isomorphisms :\n(i1 )! (M ) \u2243 (M, M [\u2212n], 1M )\n\nand (i2 )! (coker(f )[\u2212n]) \u2243 (0, coker(f )[\u2212n], 0) .\n\nSince the extension of scalars functors L(i1 )! and L(i2 )! preserve perfect modules,\nthese two objects are perfect. Finally, since perf(S(n)op \u2297A) is stable under extensions\nin Ddg (S(n)op \u2297 A), and in the above short exact sequence (3.0.5) the left and right\nvertical morphisms belong to perf(S(n)op \u2297 A), we conclude that the object X also\n\u221a\nbelongs to perf(S(n)op \u2297 A).\nDefinition 3.2 ([51, Definition 2.1(3)]). - Let M be a Quillen model category.\nAn object X in M is called homotopically finitely presented if for any filtered system\nof objects {Yj }j\u2208J in M, the induced map\nhocolim Map(X, Yj ) \u2212\u2192 Map(X, hocolim Yj )\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nis an isomorphism in Ho(sSet).\nTheorem 3.3. - Let B be a small dg category. In the Morita model structure (see\nTheorem 2.9) the following conditions are equivalent :\n\n\fD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\n16\n\n(1) The dg category B is homotopically finitely presented;\n(2) The dg category B is a retract in Hmo of a finite dg cell (see Definition 2.5);\n(3) For any filtered system {Aj }j\u2208J of dg categories, the induced morphism\n(3.0.6)\n\n\u223c\n\nhocolim rep(B, Aj ) \u2212\u2192 rep(B, hocolim Aj )\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nis an isomorphism in Hmo.\nProof. - (1) \u21d4 (2) : This equivalence follows from [42, Proposition 5.2] and [42,\nExample 5.1].\n(3) \u21d2 (1) : Let {Aj }j\u2208J be a filtered system of dg categories. By hypothesis, we\nhave an induced isomorphism in Hmo\n(3.0.7)\n\n\u223c\n\nhocolim rep(B, Aj ) \u2212\u2192 rep(B, hocolim Aj ) .\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nThanks to Corollary 2.17 we have, for any dg category A, natural isomorphisms in\nHo(sSet) :\nMap(B, A) \u2243 Map(k \u2297L B, A) \u2243 Map(k, rep(B, A)) .\n\nThe dg category k is a finite dg cell, and so using equivalence (1) \u21d4 (2) we conclude\nthat k is homotopically finitely presented. Therefore, by applying the functor\nMap(k, \u2212) : Hmo \u2212\u2192 Ho(sSet)\nto the above isomorphism (3.0.7), we obtain an induced isomorphism in Ho(sSet)\n\u223c\n\nhocolim Map(B, Aj ) \u2212\u2192 Map(B, hocolim Aj ) .\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nThis shows that B is homotopically finitely presented.\n(2) \u21d2 (3) : The class of objects in Hmo which satisfy condition (3) is clearly stable\nunder retracts. Moreover, given a small dg category A, the functor\nrep(\u2212, A) : Hmoop \u2212\u2192 Hmo\nsends homotopy colimits to homotopy limits. Since by construction homotopy pullbacks in Hmo commute with filtered homotopy colimits, we conclude that the class of\nobjects in Hmo which satisfy condition (3) is also stable under homotopy pushouts.\nTherefore, it is enough to verify condition (3) for the domains and codomains of the\nelements of the set I; see Notation 2.4. If B = \u2205 this is clear. The case where B = k\nwas proved in [51, Lemma 2.10]. If B = D(n), n \u2208 Z, we have a natural derived\nMorita equivalence\n\u223c\n\nk \u2210L\u2205 k \u2243 k \u2210 k \u2212\u2192 D(n) .\n\nTherefore, it remains to prove the case where B = S(n), n \u2208 Z. Since by Proposition 2.24 the derived tensor product preserves homotopy colimits, this case follows\n\u221a\nautomatically from Proposition 3.1.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n17\n\nTheorem 3.4. - Let B1 and B2 be homotopically finitely presented dg categories.\nThen B1 \u2297L B2 is a homotopically finitely presented dg category.\nProof. - Let {Aj }j\u2208J be a filtered system of dg categories. The proof is a consequence of the following weak equivalences :\n(3.0.8)\n\nMap(B1 \u2297L B2 , hocolim Aj ) \u2243\n\nMap(B1 , rep(B2 , hocolim Aj ))\n\n(3.0.9)\n\n\u2243\n\nMap(B1 , hocolim rep(B2 , Aj ))\n\n(3.0.10)\n\n\u2243\n\nhocolim Map(B1 , rep(B2 , Aj ))\n\n(3.0.11)\n\n\u2243\n\nhocolim Map(B1 \u2297L B2 , Aj ) .\n\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nEquivalences (3.0.8) and (3.0.11) follow from Corollary 2.17, Equivalence (3.0.9) fol\u221a\nlows from Theorem 3.3, and Equivalence (3.0.10) follows from Definition 3.2.\n4. Saturated dg categories\nIn this section we introduce Kontsevich's notion of saturated dg category. Following\nTo\u00ebn's work, we characterize these dg categories as the dualizable objects in the Morita\nhomotopy category; see Theorem 4.8. This conceptual characterization will play an\nimportant role in our applications; see Section 8.\nDefinition 4.1 (Kontsevich). - ([33, 35, 36])\n- A small dg category A is called smooth if the right dg (Aop \u2297L A)-module\n(4.0.12)\n\nA(\u2212, \u2212) : A \u2297L Aop \u2212\u2192 Cdg (k)\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 A(y, x)\n\nis perfect; see Definition 2.13.\n- A small dg category A is called proper if for each ordered pair of objects (x, y)\nin A, the complex of k-modules A(x, y) is perfect.\n- A small dg category A is called saturated if it is smooth and proper.\nRemark 4.2. - Given a dg functor F : B \u2192 A, we have a natural (B op \u2297L A)module\nB \u2297L Aop \u2212\u2192 Cdg (k)\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 A(y, F x) ,\n\nwhich belongs to rep(B, A) (see Definition 2.13). The above (Aop \u2297L A)-module\nA(\u2212, \u2212) (4.0.12) is obtained by taking B = A and F the identity dg functor.\nNotation 4.3. - Note that the class of smooth (resp. proper) dg categories is\ninvariant under derived Morita equivalences (see Definition 2.8). We denote by Hmosat\nthe full subcategory of Hmo (see Notation 2.10) whose objects are the saturated dg\ncategories.\n\n\f18\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nExample 4.4. - Consider the dg categories S(n), n \u2265 0, from \u00a72.1(ii). By construction these dg categories are proper. Thanks to Proposition 3.1, we have a natural\nisomorphism S(n)op \u2297L S(n) \u2243 rep(S(n), S(n)) in Hmo. Since the (S(n)op \u2297L S(n))module S(n)(\u2212, \u2212) belongs to rep(S(n), S(n)) (see Remark 4.2) and we have a natural\nderived Morita equivalence S(n)op \u2297L S(n) \u2192 perf(S(n)op \u2297L S(n)) (see Remark 2.14),\nwe conclude that the dg categories S(n) are also smooth. Therefore, they are saturated.\nExample 4.5. - (i) Let X be a quasi-compact and separated k-scheme. Consider\nthe category C(QCoh(X)) of (unbounded) complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves\non X. Thanks to [26], C(QCoh(X)) is a model category with monomorphisms\nas cofibrations and quasi-isomorphisms as weak equivalences. Moreover, when\nendowed with its natural C(k)-enrichment, C(QCoh(X)) becomes a C(k)-model\ncategory in the sense of [24, Definition 4.2.18]. Let Lqcoh (X) be the dg category\nof fibrant objects in C(QCoh(X)). Note that H0 (Lqcoh (X)) is naturally equivalent to the (unbounded) derived category Dqcoh (X) of quasi-coherent sheaves on\nX. Finally, let perf(X) be the full dg subcategory of Lqcoh (X) whose objects are\nthe perfect complexes. Note that H0 (perf(X)) is naturally equivalent to the category of compact objects in Dqcoh (X). Thanks to To\u00ebn (see [51, Lemma 3.27]),\nwhen X is a smooth and proper k-scheme, perf(X) is a saturated dg category.\n(ii) Let A be a k-algebra, which is projective of finite rank as a k-module, and of\nfinite global cohomological dimension. Then, the dg category of perfect complexes of A-modules is a saturated dg category.\n(iii) For examples coming from deformation quantization, we invite the reader to\nconsult [33].\nDefinition 4.6. - Let C be a symmetric monoidal category with monoidal product\n\u2297 and unit object 1. An object X in C is called dualizable (or rigid) if there exists\nan object X \u2228 in C, and maps ev : X \u2297 X \u2228 \u2192 1 and \u03b4 : 1 \u2192 X \u2228 \u2297 X such that the\ncomposites\n(4.0.13)\n\nid \u2297\u03b4\n\nev\u2297id\n\nX \u2243 X \u2297 1 \u2212\u2192 X \u2297 X \u2228 \u2297 X \u2212\u2192 1 \u2297 X \u2243 X\n\nand\n(4.0.14)\n\n\u03b4\u2297id\n\nid \u2297ev\n\nX \u2228 \u2243 1 \u2297 X \u2228 \u2212\u2192 X \u2228 \u2297 X \u2297 X \u2228 \u2212\u2192 X \u2228 \u2297 1 \u2243 X \u2228\n\nare identities. The object X \u2228 is called the dual of X, the map ev is called the\nevaluation map, and the map \u03b4 is called the co-evaluation map.\nRemark 4.7. - (i) Given ((X \u2228 )1 , ev1 , \u03b41 ) and ((X \u2228 )2 , ev2 , \u03b42 ) as in Defini\u223c\ntion 4.6, there is a unique isomorphism (X \u2228 )1 \u2192 (X \u2228 )2 making the natural\ndiagrams commute. Therefore, the dual of X, together with the evaluation and\nthe co-evaluation maps, is well-defined up to unique isomorphism.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n19\n\n(ii) Let X be a dualizable object in C. Thanks to Equations (4.0.13) and (4.0.14),\nthe evaluation and co-evaluation maps give rise to an adjunction :\n(4.0.15)\n\nOC\nX \u2228 \u2297\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2297X\n\nC\n\n\u000f\n\nIn fact, an object X of C is dualizable if and only if there exists an object X \u2032 ,\ntogether with a functorial isomorphism\nHomC (Y \u2297 X, Z) \u2243 HomC (Y, X \u2032 \u2297 Z)\n\nfor any objects Y and Z in C (and of course such an X \u2032 is a dual of X). In\nother words, X is dualizable with dual X \u2228 if and only if, for any object Z of C,\nX \u2228 \u2297 Z is the internal Hom object from X to Z.\n(iii) Let X and Y be dualizable objects in C. Then X \u2297 Y is also a dualizable object\nwith dual Y \u2228 \u2297 X \u2228 .\n(iv) Let F : C \u2192 C \u2032 be a symmetric monoidal functor. Then, if X is a dualizable\nobject in C, F (X) is a dualizable object in C \u2032 with dual F (X \u2228 ).\nWe are now ready to state the following folklore result:\nTheorem 4.8. - The dualizable objects in the Morita homotopy category Hmo (see\n\u00a72.4) are the saturated dg categories. Moreover, the dual of a saturated dg category A\nis its opposite dg category Aop .\nProof. - Let us start by introducing the category DGCAT. Its objects are the small\ndg categories. Given small dg categories B and A, the set of morphisms from B to A\nis the set of isomorphism classes in D(B op \u2297L A). Given small dg categories A1 , A2 ,\nand A3 , the composition corresponds to the derived tensor product of bimodules :\nop\nop\nL\nL\nL\nIso D(Aop\n1 \u2297 A2 ) \u00d7 Iso D(A2 \u2297 A3 ) \u2212\u2192 Iso D(A1 \u2297 A3 )\nL\n([X], [Y ])\n7\u2192\n[X \u2297A2 Y ] .\n\nAs in the case of Hmo, the derived tensor product of dg categories gives rise to a\nsymmetric monoidal structure on DGCAT, with unit object the dg category k. The\nkey property of DGCAT is that all its objects are dualizable: given a small dg category\nA, take for dual its opposite dg category Aop , for evaluation map the isomorphism\nclass in D((A \u2297L Aop )op \u2297L k) \u2243 D(Aop \u2297 A) of the (Aop \u2297L A)-module\n(4.0.16)\n\nA(\u2212, \u2212) : A \u2297L Aop \u2212\u2192 Cdg (k)\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 A(y, x) ,\n\nand for co-evaluation map the isomorphism class in D(k op \u2297L (Aop \u2297L A)) \u2243 D(Aop \u2297\nA) of the same (Aop \u2297L A)-module (4.0.16). With this choices, both composites\n(4.0.13) and (4.0.14) are identities. Note also that, by construction of DGCAT, and\nby Theorem 2.15, we have a natural symmetric monoidal functor\n(4.0.17)\n\nHmo \u2212\u2192 DGCAT\n\nA 7\u2192 A ,\n\n\f20\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nwhich is faithful but not full.\nLet A be a dualizable object in Hmo, with dual A\u2228 , evaluation map ev : A\u2297L A\u2228 \u2192\nk and co-evaluation map \u03b4 : k \u2192 A\u2228 \u2297L A. Since the above functor (4.0.17) is\nsymmetric monoidal, Remark 4.7(iv) implies that A is dualizable in DGCAT. By\nunicity of duals (see Remark 4.7(i)), A\u2228 is the opposite dg category Aop , and ev and\n\u03b4 are the isomorphism class in D(Aop \u2297L A) of the above (Aop \u2297L A)-module A(\u2212, \u2212)\n(see 4.0.16). The morphism ev belongs to Hmo, and so A(\u2212, \u2212) takes values in perfect\ncomplexes of k-modules. We conclude then that A is proper. Similarly, since \u03b4 is a\nmorphism in Hmo, A(\u2212, \u2212) belongs to perf(Aop \u2297L A). In this case we conclude that\nA is smooth. In sum, we have shown that A is saturated and that A\u2228 = Aop .\nNow, let A be a saturated dg category. Since A is proper A(\u2212, \u2212) takes values\nin perfect complexes of k-modules. Similarly, since A is smooth A(\u2212, \u2212) belongs\nto perf(Aop \u2297L A). We conclude that the evaluation and co-evaluation maps of A in\n\u221a\nDGCAT belong to the subcategory Hmo. This implies that A is dualizable in Hmo.\nWe finish this section with a comparison between saturated and homotopically\nfinitely presented dg categories (see \u00a73).\nLemma 4.9. - Let B be a saturated dg category. Then, for every dg category A,\nwe have a functorial isomorphism in Hmo\nB op \u2297L A \u2243 rep(B, A) .\nProof. - Since B \u2228 = B op , the general theory of dualizable objects implies the claim;\n\u221a\nsee Remark 4.7 (iii).\nProposition 4.10. - Every saturated dg category is homotopically finitely presented.\nProof. - Let B be a saturated dg category. Since the derived tensor product of\ndg categories preserves homotopy colimits in each variable (see Proposition 2.24),\nLemma 4.9 implies that the functor rep(B, \u2212) commutes with homotopy colimits.\n\u221a\nUsing Theorem 3.3(3) the proof is achieved.\n5. Simplicial presheaves\nIn this section we present a general theory of symmetric monoidal structures on\nsimplicial presheaves. These general results will be used in the construction of an\nexplicit symmetric monoidal structure on the category of non-commutative motives;\nsee Section 7.\nStarting from a small symmetric monoidal category C, we recall that the tensor\nproduct of C extends to simplicial presheaves on C; see \u00a75.4. Then, we prove that\nthis symmetric monoidal structure is compatible with the projective model structure;\nsee Theorem 5.2. Finally, we study its behavior under left Bousfield localizations.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n21\n\nWe describe in particular a \"minimal\" compatibility condition between the tensor\nproduct and a localizing set; see Theorem 5.7.\n5.1.

Because of its\nuniversal property, which is a reminiscence of motives, Motloc\ndg is called the localizing\nmotivator. Its base category Motloc\n(e)\nis\na\ntriangulated\ncategory\nand is morally what\ndg\nwe would like to consider as the category of non-commutative motives.\nExample 7.4. - Examples of localizing invariants include Hochschild homology\nand cyclic homology (see [42, Theorem 10.7]), non-connective algebraic K-theory\n(see [42, Theorem 10.9]), and even topological Hochschild homology and topological\ncyclic homology (see [2, Theorem 6.1] and [45, \u00a78]).\nIn this section we introduce a new ingredient in Theorem 7.2: symmetric monoidal\nstructures. As shown in Theorem 2.23 the derivator HO(dgcat) carries a symmetric\nmonoidal structure. It is therefore natural to consider localizing invariants which are\nsymmetric monoidal; see Examples 7.9-7.11. Our main result is the following.\nTheorem 7.5. - The localizing motivator Motloc\ndg carries a canonical symmetric moloc\nnoidal structure \u2212 \u2297L \u2212, making the universal localizing invariant Udg\nsymmetric\nmonoidal (see \u00a7A.5). Moreover, this tensor product preserves homotopy colimits in\neach variable, and is characterized by the following universal property: given any\nstrong triangulated derivator D (see \u00a7A.3), endowed with a symmetric monoidal structure which preserves homotopy colimits in each variable, we have an induced equivalence of categories\n\u223c\n\n\u2297\nloc\nloc \u2217\n(Udg\n) : Hom\u2297\n!

Furthermore, Motloc\ndg admits an explicit symmetric monoidal\nQuillen model.\nDefinition 7.6. - The objects of the category Hom\u2297\nloc (HO(dgcat), D) are called\nsymmetric monoidal localizing invariants.\nCorollary 7.7. - Any dualizable object of Motloc\ndg (e) is compact; see Definition 4.6\nand \u00a71.2. In particular, given any saturated dg category A (see Definition 4.1), the\nloc\nobject Udg\n(A) is compact.\nProof. - Let M be a dualizable object of Motloc\ndg (e). We need to prove that the\nfunctor Hom(M, \u2212) commutes with arbitrary sums. Since M is dualizable, this functor\nloc\nloc\nis isomorphic to Hom(Udg\n(k), M \u2228 \u2297L \u2212). The unit object Udg\n(k) is known to be\ncompact (see [11, Theorem 7.16]), and so the first assertion is proven. The second\nloc\nloc\nassertion follows from the fact that Udg\nis symmetric monoidal, and that Udg\n(A)\nis dualizable for any saturated dg category A (see Remark 4.7 (iv) and Theorem\n\u221a\n4.8).\nRemark 7.8. - Although we do not know if the triangulated category Motloc\ndg (e) is\ncompactly generated, Corollary 7.7 implies that the localizing triangulated subcategory of Motloc\ndg (e) generated by dualizable objects is compactly generated.\nBefore proving Theorem 7.5, let us give some examples of symmetric monoidal\nlocalizing invariants.\nExample 7.9 (Hochschild homology). - Let A be a small k-flat dg category; see\nDefinition 2.19. We can associate to A a simplicial object in C(k), i.e. a contravariant\nfunctor from \u2206 to C(k) : its n-th term is given by\nM\nA(xn , x0 ) \u2297 A(xn\u22121 , xn ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 A(x0 , x1 ) ,\n(x0 ,...,xn )\n\nwhere (x0 , . . . , xn ) is an ordered sequence of objects in A. The face maps are given\nby\n\u001a\n(fn , . . . , fi \u25e6 fi\u22121 , . . . , f0 ) if i > 0\ndi (fn , . . . , fi , fi\u22121 , . . . , f0 ) =\n(\u22121)(n+\u03c3) (f0 \u25e6 fn , . . . , f1 ) if i = 0\nwhere \u03c3 = (degf0 )(degf1 + . . . + degfn\u22121 ), and the degenerancies maps are given by\nsj (fn , . . . , fj , fj\u22121 , . . . , f0 ) = (fn , . . . , fj , idxj , fj\u22121 , . . . , f0 ) .\nAssociated to this simplicial object we have a chain complex in C(k) (by the DoldKan equivalence), and so a bicomplex of k-modules. The Hochschild complex HH (A)\nof A is the sum-total complex associated to this bicomplex. If A is an arbitrary dg\ncategory, its Hochschild complex is obtained by first taking a k-flat (e.g. cofibrant)\nresolution of A; see Definition 2.19. This construction furnishes us a functor\nHH : dgcat \u2212\u2192 C(k) ,\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n29\n\nwhich by [42, Theorem 10.7] gives rise to a localizing invariant\n(7.0.1)\n\nHH : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 HO(C(k)) .\n\nGiven small dg categories A and B, we have a functorial quasi-isomorphism\nsh : HH (A) \u2297 HH (B) \u2212\u2192 HH (A \u2297 B)\ngiven by the shuffle product map; see [38, \u00a74.2.3]. The localizing invariant (7.0.1),\nendowed with the shuffle product map, becomes then a symmetric monoidal localizing\ninvariant.\nExample 7.10 (Mixed complexes). - Following Kassel [29, \u00a71] we denote by \u039b\nthe dg algebra k[\u01eb]/\u01eb2 , where \u01eb is of degree \u22121 and d(\u01eb) = 0. Under this notation, a\nmixed complex is a right dg \u039b-module (see Definition 2.6).\nLet A be a small dg category. The Hochschild complex HH (A) of A (see Example 7.9), endowed with the cyclic operator\ntn (fn\u22121 , . . . , f0 ) = (\u22121)n+\u03c3 (f0 , fn\u22121 , fn\u22122 , . . . , f1 ) ,\ngives rise to a mixed complex C (A); see [31, \u00a71.3].

Moreover, this\nsymmetric monoidal structure is compatible with the projective model structure (see\n\u00a72.2). Thanks to [29, Theorem 2.4] the localizing invariant (7.0.2) becomes then a\nsymmetric monoidal localizing invariant.\nThis example will be used in the construction of a canonical Chern character\nmap from non-connective algebraic K-theory to negative cyclic homology; see Example 8.10.\nExample 7.11 (Periodic complexes). - In this example we assume that our\nbase ring k is a field. Let k[u] be the cocommutative Hopf algebra of polynomials\nin one variable u of degree 2; see [29, \u00a71]. Consider the symmetric monoidal model\ncategory k[u]-Comod of k[u]-comodules; see [24, Theorem 2.5.17]. The monoidal\nstructure is given by the cotensor product \u2212\u0003k[u] \u2212 of comodules, with unit k[u].\nGiven a mixed complex M (see Example 7.10) we denote by P (M ) the k[u]comodule, whose underlying complex is M \u2297L\u039b k, obtained by iteration of the map\nS\n\n(M \u2297L\u039b k)[\u22122] \u2212\u2192 M \u2297L\u039b k ,\n\n\fD.-C.

In each one of these propositions we construct an explicit symmetric monoidal Quillen model for the corresponding (intermediate) derivator of the composition (7.1.1).\nWe start by fixing on dgcat a fibrant resolution functor R, a cofibrant resolution\nfunctor Q, a left framing \u0393\u2217 (i.e. a well-behaved cosimplicial resolution functor; see\n[24, Definition 5.2.7 and Theorem 5.2.8]), as well as a small full subcategory dgcatf\nof dgcat, satisfying the following properties :\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nany finite dg cell (see Definition 2.5) is in dgcatf ;\nany object in dgcatf is homotopically finitely presentated (see Definition 3.2);\ngiven any object A in dgcatf , Q(R(A)) and Q(A) belong to dgcatf ;\nfor any cofibrant object A of dgcatf , if \u0393\u2217 (A) denotes the given cosimplicial\nframe of A, then \u0393n (A) belongs to dgcatf for all n \u2265 0.\n\nWe let \u03a3 be the set of derived Morita equivalences in dgcatf .

Note\nthe projective model structure on s dgcat\nthat, up to Quillen equivalence, this construction does not depend on the choice of\nthe category dgcatf but only on the Dwyer-Kan localization of dgcatf by \u03a3 (see [18]).\nThe above stability properties imply that the Dwyer-Kan localization of dgcatf by \u03a3\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n31\n\nis simply (equivalent to) the full simplicial subcategory of the Dwyer-Kan localization\nof the model category dgcat spanned by the homotopically finitely presented dg categories. In order to obtain a symmetric monoidal structure, we have then the freedom\nto add the following properties to dgcatf :\n(e) any dg category in dgcatf is k-flat (see Definition 2.19);\n(f) given any dg categories A and B in dgcatf , A \u2297 B belongs to dgcatf (this makes\nsense because of Theorem 3.4).\nIn the sequel, we assume that a small full subcategory dgcatf of dgcat satisfying all\nthe above properties (a)\u2013(f) has been chosen; for instance, one might consider the\nsmallest one relatively to R, Q and \u0393\u2217 .

TABUADA\n\nto Lemma 2.24, the symmetric monoidal structure on HO(dgcat) preserves filtered\nhomotopy colimits.\nNow, recall the universal property of HO(dgcat) : it is the free completion of\nthe prederivator dgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ] by filtered homotopy colimits. In other words, given\nany derivator D, the category of filtered homotopy colimit preserving morphisms\nfrom HO(dgcat) to D is canonically equivalent to the category of morphisms from\ndgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ] to D; see [42, \u00a75]. Replacing D by the derivator of filtered homotopy colimit preserving morphisms from HO(dgcat) to D, we deduce that the category of morphisms from HO(dgcat)\u00d7HO(dgcat) to D which preserve filtered homotopy colimits in\neach variable is equivalent to the category of morphisms from dgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ]\u00d7dgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ]\nto D. By induction, we prove similarly that, for any n \u2265 0, the category of morphisms\nfrom HO(dgcat)n to D which preserve filtered homotopy colimits in each variable is\nequivalent to the category of morphisms from dgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ]n to D. As the morphism i\nin the above diagram (7.1.2) is symmetric monoidal, this implies that the morphism\nRh is symmetric monoidal as well. Similarly, we see that, given any derivator D, the\ncategory of symmetric monoidal morphisms from dgcatf [\u03a3\u22121 ] to D is equivalent to the\ncategory of filtered homotopy colimit preserving symmetric monoidal morphisms from\nHO(dgcat) to D.

Kontsevich's non-commutative mixed motives. - Kontsevich introduced in [33, 34, 35] the category of non-commutative mixed motives. His\nconstruction decomposes in three steps :\n(1) First, consider the following category KPMk , enriched over symmetric spectra:\nthe objects are the dualizable dg categories (see Definition 4.1); given saturated\ndg categories A and B, the symmetric spectrum of morphisms from A to B is the\nnon-connective K-theory spectrum IK(Aop \u2297L B); the composition corresponds\nto the derived tensor product of bimodules(2) .\n(2) Then, take the formal triangulated envelope tri(KPMk ) of KPMk . Objects in\nthis new category are formal finite extensions of formal shifts of objects in\nKPMk .\n(3) Finally, add formal direct summands for projectors in tri(KPMk ). The resulting\ncategory KMMk is what Kontsevich named the category of non-commutative\nmixed motives(3) .\nA precise way to perform these constructions consists on seeing KMMk as the spectral\ncategory of perfect KPMk -modules (KMMk is the Morita completion of KPMk ; see\n[46, \u00a75.2] for a precise exposition of these constructions).\nThanks to Theorem 8.2, we are now able to construct a fully-faithful embedding of\nKMMk into our category Motloc\ndg (e) of non-commutative motives, i.e. the base category\nof the localizing motivator. Note that, in contrast with Kontsevich's ad hoc definition, our category of non-commutative motives is defined purely in terms of precise\nuniversal properties.\nloc\nLet Motloc\ndg be the model category underlying the derivator Motdg . As, by construction, Motloc\ndg is a left Bousfield localization of a category of presheaves of symmetric\nspectra over some small category, this model category is canonically enriched over\nsymmetric spectra. We can thus consider the category Motloc\ndg (e) as a category enriched over symmetric spectra (by considering fibrant and cofibrant objects in Motloc\ndg ).\nProposition 8.5. - There is a natural fully-faithful embedding (enriched over symmetric spectra) of Kontsevich's category of non-commutative motives KMMk into the\ncategory Motloc\ndg (e). The essential image is the thick triangulated subcategory spanned\nby motives of saturated dg categories.\nProof. - Given saturated dg categories A and B, Lemma 4.9 implies that we have a\nnatural isomorphism in Hmo\nAop \u2297L B \u2243 rep(A, B) .\n(2) This\n\ncategory is the non-commutative (and derived) analogue of Grothendieck's category of pure\nmotives : PM stands for Pure Motives, while K stands for both Kontsevich and K-theory.\n(3) MM stands for Mixed Motives, while K stands for both Kontsevich and K-theory.\n\n\f38\n\nD.-C.

Chern characters. - In [11] the authors used the co-representability Theorem 8.1 to classify all natural transformations out of non-connective K-theory. More\nprecisely, they proved in [11, Theorem 8.1] that given a localizing invariant L, with values in the derivators of spectra, the data of a natural transformation IK(\u2212) \u21d2 L(\u2212)\nis equivalent to the datum of a single class in the stable homotopy group \u03c00 L(k).\nFrom this result they obtained higher Chern characters (resp. higher trace maps),\nfrom non-connective K-theory to (topological) cyclic homology (resp. to (topological)\nHochschild homology); see [11, Theorem 8.4].\nHowever, negative cyclic homology HC \u2212 and periodic cyclic homology HP do not\npreserve filtered homotopy colimits since they are defined using infinite products; see\n[38, \u00a75.1]. Therefore, they are not examples of localizing invariants and so the theory\ndeveloped in [11] is not directly applicable in these cases. Nevertheless, we shall\nexplain below why and how negative cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology\nfit naturally in our framework; see Examples 8.10 and 8.11.\nLet D be a strong triangulated derivator endowed with a symmetric monoidal\nstructure (with unit 1) which preserves homotopy colimits in each variable (see \u00a7A.5),\nand\nE : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 D\na symmetric monoidal localizing invariant (see Definition 7.6).

Since\nby hypothesis D is triangulated, we have a natural morphism of derivators\nRHom(1, \u2212) : D \u2212\u2192 HO(SpN )\n\n(see \u00a7A.9) .\n\nThe composed morphism\nN\nEabs := RHom(1, Egm (\u2212)) : Motloc\ndg \u2212\u2192 HO(Sp )\n\nis called the absolute realization of E .\nGiven a symmetric monoidal localizing invariant E , we have two objects associated\nto a non-commutative motive M \u2208 Motloc\ndg (e) : its geometric realization Egm (M ) and\nits absolute realization Eabs (M ). Although the morphism Egm always preserves homotopy colimits, this is not always the case for the morphism Eabs ; a sufficient (and\nalmost necessary) condition for Eabs to preserve homotopy colimits is that the unit 1\nof D is a compact object.\nProposition 8.7. - The geometric realization of E induces a canonical Chern character\nloc\nIK(\u2212) \u21d2 RHom(1, E(\u2212)) \u2243 Eabs (Udg\n(\u2212)) .\n\nloc\nHere, IK(\u2212) and Eabs (Udg\n(\u2212)) are two morphisms of derivators defined on HO(dgcat).\n\nProof. - The geometric realization of E is symmetric monoidal and so it sends the\nloc\nunit object Udg\n(k) to 1 \u2208 D. Therefore, given a small dg category A, we obtain an\ninduced map\nloc\nloc\nloc\nloc\nIK(A) \u2243 RHomMotloc\n(Udg\n(k), Udg\n(A)) \u2212\u2192 RHomD (1, Egm (Udg\n(A))) = Eabs (Udg\n(A)) ,\ndg\n\nwhere the left-hand side equivalence follows from Theorem 8.1. Since this induced\n\u221a\nmap is functorial in A, the proof is finished.\nLet us now give some examples which illustrate Proposition 8.7.\nExample 8.8 (Non-connective K-theory). - The tautological version of the\nloc\nsituation above is: for E = Udg\n, Egm is by definition the identity of Motloc\ndg (see\nTheorem 7.5), while Eabs = IK is non-connective K-theory (see Theorem 8.1). The\ncorresponding Chern character is the identity, and this is in this precise sense that\nnon-connective K-theory is initial among absolute homology theories.\nExample 8.9 (Hochschild homology). - Take for E the symmetric monoidal localizing invariant\nHH : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 HO(C(k))\n\nof Example 7.9. In this case, there is no difference (up to the Dold-Kan correspondance\nrelating complexes of k-modules and spectra) between the geometric and the absolute\nrealization: if we consider HO(C(k)) as enriched over itself, then the morphism\nRHom(k, \u2212) : HO(C(k)) \u2212\u2192 HO(C(k))\n\n\fD.-C.

This can be seen\nas follows. Given a mixed complex M (see Example 7.10), a map k[u] \u2192 P (M ) in\nk[u]-Comod corresponds to a collection of maps k \u2192 (M \u2297L\u039b k)[2n], n \u2265 0, in C(k)\nwhich are compatible with the operator S.

Thanks to Theorem 7.5, we are now able to make this\nconnection precise; see Remarks 8.17-8.19. We shall use the following well known\nproperty of dualizable objects in a triangulated category.\nProposition 8.14. - Let C be a closed symmetric monoidal triangulated category.\nThen, the category C \u2228 of dualizable objects in C (see Definition 4.6) is a symmetric\nmonoidal thick triangulated subcategory of C.\nProof. - The fact that dualizable objects are stable under tensor product is clear;\nsee Remark 4.7(iii). For an object X in C, set X \u2228 = Hom(X, 1). Given two objects\nX and Y in C, we have a canonical map\nuX,Y : X \u2228 \u2297 Y \u2212\u2192 Hom(X, Y )\n\nwhich corresponds by adjunction to the map X \u2228 \u2297 X \u2297 Y \u2192 Y obtained by tensoring\nY with the evaluation map X \u2297 X \u2228 \u2192 1. The object X is dualizable if and only if\n\n\f42\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nthe map uX,Y is invertible for any object Y . Since for any fixed object Y the map\nuX,Y is a natural transformation of triangulated functors, we conclude that C \u2228 is a\n\u221a\nthick triangulated subcategory of C.\nNotation 8.15. - Thanks to Theorem 7.5 the localizing motivator carries a\nsymmetric monoidal structure, and so its base category Motloc\ndg,k (e) is a symmetric monoidal triangulated category. Therefore by Proposition 8.14, the category\n\u2228\nMotloc\ndg,k (e) of dualizable objects is a symmetric monoidal thick triangulated subcategory of Motloc\ndg,k (e).\nLet KMMk be Kontsevich's category of non-commutative mixed motives. Thanks\nto Proposition 8.5, we can identify it with the thick triangulated subcategory of\n\u2228\nloc\nMotloc\ndg,k (e) generated by objects of shape Udg (A), where A runs over the family\nof saturated dg categories over k. Therefore, KMMk is naturally a rigid symmetric\nmonoidal triangulated category.\nDefinition 8.16. - Let k be a commutative ring. The Grothendieck ring K0 (k) of\nnon-commutative motives over k is the Grothendieck ring K0 (KMMk ).\nRemark 8.17 (Non-triviality). - Recall from Example 7.9 the construction of\nthe symmetric monoidal localizing invariant\nHH : HO(dgcat) \u2212\u2192 HO(C(k)) .\nBy restricting its geometric realization (see Definition 8.6) to the base category, we\nobtain a symmetric monoidal triangulated functor\nHH gm (e) : Motloc\ndg,k (e) \u2212\u2192 HO(C(k))(e) = D(k) .\nRecall that the dualizable objects in D(k) are precisely the perfect complexes of kmodules. Therefore, by Remark 4.7 (iv), HH gm (e) sends dualizable objects to perfect\ncomplexes and so it induces a ring homomorphism\n(8.4.1)\n\nrK0 : K0 (k) = K0 (KMMk ) \u2212\u2192 K0 (Dc (k)) = K0 (k) .\n\nFinally, since K0 (k) is non-trivial we conclude that K0 (k) is also non-trivial.\nRemark 8.18 (Functoriality). - Given a ring homomorphism k \u2192 k \u2032 , we have a\nbase change functor\n\u2212 \u2297k k \u2032 : dgcatk \u2212\u2192 dgcatk\u2032\n\nA 7\u2192 A \u2297k k \u2032 .\n\nThis functor gives rise to a morphism of derivators\n\u2212 \u2297Lk k \u2032 : HO(dgcatk ) \u2212\u2192 HO(dgcatk\u2032 ) ,\nwhich is symmetric monoidal, preserves homotopy colimits (and the point), and satisfies localization; see Theorem 7.2.

Properties. -\n\n(i) A derivator D is called strong if for every finite free category X and every\nsmall category Y , the natural functor D(X \u00d7 Y ) \u2192 Fun(X op , D(Y )) is full and\nessentially surjective.\n(ii) A derivator D is called regular if sequential homotopy colimits commute with\nfinite products and homotopy pullbacks.\n(iii) A derivator D is called pointed if for any closed immersion i : Z \u2192 X in Cat\nthe cohomological direct image functor i\u2217 : D(Z) \u2192 D(X) has a right adjoint,\nand if, dually, for any open immersion j : U \u2192 X the homological direct image\nfunctor j! : D(U ) \u2192 D(X) has a left adjoint; see [12, Definition 1.13].\n(iv) A derivator D is called triangulated or stable if it is pointed and if every global\ncommutative square is cartesian exactly when it is cocartesian; see [12, Definition 1.15].\nA strong derivator is the same thing as a small homotopy theory in the sense of\nHeller [22]. Thanks to [10, Proposition 2.15], if M is a Quillen model category\nits associated derivator HO(M) is strong. Moreover, if sequential homotopy colimits\ncommute with finite products and homotopy pullbacks in M, the associated derivator\nHO(M) is regular. Notice that if M is pointed, then the derivator HO(M) is pointed.\nFinally, a pointed Quillen model category M is stable if and only if its associated\nderivator HO(M) is triangulated.\nb\nA.4. Kan extensions. - Given a small category A, we denote by HotA = HO(s A)\nthe derivator associated to the projective model category structure on the category\nof simplicial presehaves. We then have a Yoneda embedding\n(A.4.1)\n\nh : A \u2212\u2192 HotA .\n\nLet D be a derivator. A 2-functorial version of the Yoneda lemma gives a canonical\nequivalence of categories\nHom(A, D) \u2243 D(Aop ) .\n\n\f48\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nTheorem A.1. - The morphism of prederivators (A.4.1) is the universal morphism\nfrom A to a derivator. In other words, given any derivator D, the induced functor\n\u223c\n\nh\u2217 : Hom! (HotA , D) \u2212\u2192 Hom(A, D)\nis an equivalence of categories.\n\u221a\n\nProof. - See [9, Corollaire 3.26].\n\nA.5. Monoidal structures. - Thanks to [9, Proposition 5.2] the 2-category of\nprederivators form a closed symmetric monoidal 2-category with respect to the cartesian product. Given two prederivators D and D\u2032 , we denote by Hom(D, D\u2032 ) the\ncorresponding internal Hom; see [9, \u00a75.1].\nGiven a prederivator D, by a symmetric monoidal structure on D we mean a structure of symmetric pseudo monoid on D. In other words, for every small category X,\nD(X) is a symmetric monoidal category, and for every functor u : X \u2192 Y between\nsmall categories, the inverse image functor\nu\u2217 : D(u) : D(Y ) \u2212\u2192 D(X)\nis symmetric monoidal; see [9, \u00a75.4]. A symmetric monoidal prederivator is a prederivator endowed with a symmetric monoidal structure. Given symmetric monoidal\nprederivators D and D\u2032 , we denote by Hom\u2297 (D, D\u2032 ) the category of symmetric\nmonoidal morphisms; see [9, \u00a75.11] for details. A symmetric monoidal derivator is\na symmetric monoidal prederivator D which is also a derivator, and such that the\ntensor product preserves homotopy colimits in each variable, i.e. sucht that, for any\nobject X \u2208 D(e) the induced morphism\nX \u2297 \u2212 : D \u2212\u2192 D\npreserves homotopy colimits.\n\u2032\nGiven symmetric monoidal derivators D and D\u2032 , we denote by Hom\u2297\n! (D, D ) the\ncategory of symmetric monoidal morphisms which preserve homotopy colimits.\nA basic example of a symmetric monoidal prederivator is given as follows : let M\nbe a symmetric monoidal category (with monoidal product \u2212 \u2297 \u2212) and W a class\nof morphisms in M. If the monoidal product preserves the class W, i.e. if we have\nan inclusion W \u2297 W \u2286 W, then the prederivator M[W \u22121 ] of \u00a7A.1 is naturally a\nsymmetric monoidal prederivator. Moreover, if F : (M, W) \u2192 (N , V) is a symmetric\nmonoidal functor such that F (W) \u2282 V, then the induced morphism\nM[W \u22121 ] \u2212\u2192 N [V \u22121 ]\nis symmetric monoidal.\nAs for examples of symmetric monoidal derivators, most of them are obtained from\nsymmetric monoidal model categories [24, Definition 4.2.6].\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n49\n\nProposition A.2. - Let M be a symmetric monoidal model category. Then its associated derivator HO(M) carries a symmetric monoidal structure. Moreover, any\nsymmetric monoidal left Quillen functor between symmetric monoidal model categories induces a symmetric monoidal morphism between the associated derivators.\n\u221a\nProof. - See [9, Proposition 6.1].\nA.6. Derived Day convolution product. - Let A be a small symmetric\nb\nmonoidal category. Then A is a symmetric monoidal prederivator. Moreover, as s A\nis then a symmetric monoidal model category (see Theorem 5.2), the derivator HotA\nis then a symmetric monoidal derivator, in such a way that the Yoneda embedding\n(A.4.1) is a symmetric monoidal morphism of prederivators. Given a symmetric\nmonoidal derivator D, we thus have an induced functor\n(A.6.1)\n\n\u2297\nh\u2217 : Hom\u2297\n! (HotA , D) \u2212\u2192 Hom (A, D) .\n\nTheorem A.3. - The functor (A.6.1) is an equivalence of categories.\nProof. - This is simply a variation on Theorem A.1. Given two derivators D\u2032 and\nD\u2032\u2032 , the derivator Hom! (D\u2032 , D\u2032\u2032 ) is defined by\nHom! (D\u2032 , D\u2032\u2032 )(A) = Hom! (D\u2032 , D\u2032\u2032A ) ,\nwhere D\u2032\u2032A is in turn the derivator of \"presheaves on A with values in A\", i.e. the\nderivator defined by\nD\u2032\u2032A (X) = D\u2032\u2032 (A \u00d7 X) .\n\nFor a third derivator D, the data of a morphism of prederivators\nD \u00d7 D\u2032 \u2212\u2192 D\u2032\u2032\n\nwhich preserves homotopy colimits in each variable is equivalent to the data of an\nobject in Hom! (D, Hom! (D\u2032 , D\u2032\u2032 )); see [9, Lemme 5.18]. Moreover, when D\u2032 is of the\nform HotB , with B a small category, it follows immediately from Theorem A.1 that\nwe have equivalences of derivators\nHom! (HotB , D\u2032\u2032 ) \u2243 Hom(B, D\u2032\u2032 ) \u2243 D\u2032\u2032B op .\nHence, if A is another small category, we obtain canonical equivalences of categories :\nHom! (HotA , Hom! (HotB , D\u2032\u2032 )) \u2243 Hom(A, Hom! (HotB , D\u2032\u2032 ))\n\u2243 Hom(A, Hom(B, D\u2032\u2032 ))\n\n\u2243 Hom(A \u00d7 B, D\u2032\u2032 ) = D\u2032\u2032 (Aop \u00d7 B op ) .\n\nFor A = B and D\u2032\u2032 = HotA , we note that the tensor product on HotA corresponds, under these equivalences of categories, to the tensor product \u2297 : A \u00d7 A \u2212\u2192 A composed\nwith the Yoneda embeding (A.4.1).\nMore generally, we obtain (by induction on n \u2265 0) that for any n-tuple of small\ncategories (A1 , . . . , An ), the category of morphisms HotA1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 HotAn \u2212\u2192 D\u2032\u2032\n\n\f50\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nwhich preserve homotopy colimits in each variable is canonically equivalent to the\ncategory of morphisms A1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 An \u2212\u2192 D\u2032\u2032 . This fact implies that the symmetric\nmonoidal structure on A extends uniquely to a symmetric monoidal structure on the\nderivator HotA . Moreover, the category of symmetric monoidal morphisms from HotA\nto D\u2032\u2032 , which preserve homotopy colimits, is canonically equivalent to the category of\n\u221a\nsymmetric monoidal morphisms from A to D\u2032\u2032 .\nA.7. Left Bousfield localization. - Let D be a derivator and S a class of morphisms in the base category D(e). We say that the derivator D admits a left Bousfield\nlocalization with respect to the class S, if there exists a morphism of derivators\n\u03b3 : D \u2212\u2192 LS D ,\nwhich commutes with homotopy colimits, sends the elements of S to isomorphisms\nin LS D(e), and satisfies the following universal property : given any derivator D\u2032 , the\nmorphism \u03b3 induces an equivalence of categories\n\u223c\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 : Hom! (LS D, D\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 Hom!,S (D, D\u2032 ) ,\nwhere Hom!,S (D, D\u2032 ) denotes the category of morphisms of derivators which commute\nwith homotopy colimits and send the elements of S to isomorphisms in D\u2032 (e).\nTheorem A.4. - Let M be a left proper cellular model category and S a set of\nmaps in the homotopy category Ho(M) of M. Consider the left Bousfield localization\nLS M of M with respect to the set S, i.e. to perform the localization we choose in\nM a representative for each element of S. Then, the induced morphism of derivators\nHO(M) \u2192 HO(LS M) is a left Bousfield localization of the derivator HO(M) with\nrespect to the set S. Moreover, we have a natural adjunction of derivators :\nHO(M)\nO\n\u000f\nHO(LS M) .\nProof. - See [42, Theorem 4.4].\n\n\u221a\n\nRemark A.5. - If the domains and codomains of the elements of the set S are\nhomotopically finitely presented (see Definition 3.2), the morphism HO(LS M) \u2192\nHO(M) (right adjoint to the localizing functor) preserves filtered homotopy colimits.\nTherefore, under these hypothesis, if HO(M) is regular so it is HO(LS M).\nBy [42, Lemma 4.3], the Bousfield localization LS D of a triangulated derivator D\nremains triangulated as long as S is stable under the loop space functor. For more\ngeneral S, to remain in the world of triangulated derivators, one has to localize with\nrespect to the set \u03a9(S) generated by S and loops, as follows.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n51\n\nProposition A.6. - Let D be a triangulated derivator and S a class of morphisms\nin D(e). Let us denote by \u03a9(S) the smallest class of morphisms in D(e) which contains S and is stable under the loop space functor \u03a9 : D(e) \u2192 D(e). Then for any\ntriangulated derivator T, we have an equality of categories\nHom!,\u03a9(S) (D, T) = Hom!,S (D, T) .\nAs a consequence, whenever L\u03a9(S) D exists, this is the triangulated left Bousfied localization of D with respect to S.\nProof. - For F an element of Hom! (D, T), the functor F (e) : D(e) \u2192 T(e) commutes\nwith homotopy colimits, hence it commutes in particular with the suspension functor.\nSince both D and T are triangulated, suspension and loop space functors are inverse\nto each other. Hence F (e) also commutes with \u03a9. It is then obvious that F (e) sends\n\u221a\nS to isomorphisms if and only if it does so with \u03a9(S).\nTheorem A.7 (Dugger). - Let M be a combinatorial model category. Then, there\nb such that\nexists a small category A and a small set of maps S in HotA (e) = Ho(s A),\nHO(M) is equivalent to LS HotA .\nProof. - This follows from [14, Proposition 3.3] and from Theorem A.4 applied to\nthe projective model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves of a small\n\u221a\ncategory.\nRemark A.8. - It follows immediately from Theorem A.7 that the statement of\nTheorem A.4 holds also for left proper combinatoriel model categories. In particular,\nany derivator which is equivalent to a derivator associated to a combinatorial model\ncategory admits a left Bousfield localization with respect to any small set of maps.\nProposition A.9. - Let D be a symmetric monoidal derivator, and S a class of\nmaps in D(e). Assume that S is closed under tensor product in D, and that the left\nBousfield localization of D by S exists. Then, LS D is symmetric monoidal, and the\nlocalization morphism \u03b3 : D \u2212\u2192 LS D is symmetric monoidal. Moreover, given any\nsymmetric monoidal derivator D\u2032 , the induced functor\n\u2297\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b3 \u2217 : Hom\u2297\n! (LS D, D ) \u2212\u2192 Hom! (D, D )\n\nis fully-faithful, and its essential image consists of the symmetric monoidal homotopy\ncolimit preserving morphisms which send S to isomorphisms.\nProof. - This is an immediate consequence of the universal property of LS D. The\n\u221a\ndetails are left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n\f52\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nA.8. Stabilization. - Let D be a derivator. Then there is a universal pointed\nderivator D \u2192 D\u2022 : given any pointed derivator D\u2032 , the induced functor\n\u223c\n\nHom! (D\u2022 , D\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 Hom! (D, D\u2032 )\nis an equivalence of categories; see [9, Corollaire 4.19]. Using the explicit construction\nof D\u2022 (see [9, \u00a74.5]) it is easy to see that when D\u2022 is strong (resp. regular) so is D. If\nD = HO(M) for some model category M, then D\u2022 is equivalent to HO(M\u2022 ), where\nM\u2022 denotes the model category of pointed objects in M; see [24, Proposition 1.1.8].\nLet D be a pointed derivator. A stabilization of D is a homotopy colimit preserving\nmorphism stab : D \u2192 St(D), with St(D) a triangulated strong derivator, which is\nuniversal for these properties : given any triangulated strong derivator T, the induced\nfunctor\n\u223c\n\nstab\u2217 : Hom! (St(D), T) \u2212\u2192 Hom! (D, T) .\nis an equivalence of categories.\nTheorem A.10 (Heller [22]). - Any pointed regular strong derivator admits a\nstabilization.\nGiven a pointed simplicial model category M, the second named author compared\nin [42, \u00a78] the derivator associated to the model category SpN (M) of S 1 -spectra on\nM with the stabilization of the derivator associated to the model category M.\nProposition A.11. - Let M be a pointed, simplicial, left proper, cellular model\ncategory. Assume that sequential homotopy colimits commute with finite products and\nhomotopy pullbacks. Then, the induced morphism of triangulated strong derivators\n\u223c\n\nSt(HO(M)) \u2212\u2192 HO(SpN (M))\nis an equivalence.\n\u221a\n\nProof. - See [42, Theorem 8.7].\n\nLet D be a pointed strong derivator (see \u00a7A.3) and S be a class of morphisms in\nD(e). Assume that D admits a left Bousfield localization LS D with respect to S; see\n\u00a7A.7. Assume also that the stablization St(D) of D exists.\nWe then have two homotopy colimit preserving morphisms :\n\u03b3\n\nstab\n\nLS D \u2190\u2212\u2212 D \u2212\u2212\u2192 St(D) .\nBy examining the relevant universal properties, we obtain the following result.\nProposition A.12. - Under the above assumptions, the derivator L\u03a9(stab(S)) St(D)\nexists if and only if the derivator St(LS D) exists. Moreover, if this is the case, then\nL\u03a9(stab(S)) St(D) \u2243 St(LS D) under D.\n\n\fSYMMETRIC MONOIDAL STRUCTURE ON NON-COMMUTATIVE MOTIVES\n\n53\n\nCorollary A.13. - Let M be a pointed left proper combinatorial model category.\nThen the stabilization St(HO(M)) of HO(M) exists and is equivalent to the derivator\nassociated to a stable combinatorial model category.\nProof. - Thanks to Theorem A.7 we may assume that HO(M) \u2243 LS HotA,\u2022 . Using\nProposition A.12 and Theorem A.4, we see it is sufficient to treat the case where S is\n\u221a\nthe empty set. Proposition A.11 allow us then to conclude the proof.\nRemark A.14. - A careful analysis of the proof of the Corollary A.13 will lead\nto a proof of Proposition A.11 for any simplicial combinatorial model category M.\nNote that since any combinatorial model category is equivalent to a simplicial one, we\nconclude the existence of stabilizations for any derivator associated to a combinatorial\nmodel category; however, we will not need this level of generality.\nTheorem A.15. - Let A be a small symmetric monoidal category. Then there is a\nunique symmetric monoidal structure on the triangulated derivator St(HotA,\u2022 ) whose\ntensor product preserves homotopy colimits in each variables, such that the composed\nmorphism\nA \u2212\u2192 HotA \u2212\u2192 St(HotA,\u2022 )\n\nis symmetric monoidal. Moreover, given any strong triangulated derivator D, the\ninduced functor\n\u223c\n\n\u2297\nHom\u2297\n! (St(HotA,\u2022 ), D) \u2212\u2192 Hom (A, D)\n\nis an equivalence of categories.\nProof. - It follows immediately from Theorem A.1 and from the universal property\nof St(HotA,\u2022 ) that, for any small category A and any strong triangulated derivator D,\nwe have canonical equivalences of categories:\nHom! (St(HotA,\u2022 ), D) \u2243 Hom(A, D) \u2243 D(Aop ) .\nStarting from this point on, the proof of Theorem A.3 holds here mutatis mutandis.\n\u221a\nRemark A.16. - The derivator St(HotA,\u2022 ) is equivalent to the derivator associated to the model category of symmetric spectra in the category of pointed simplicial presheaves on A. This equivalence defines a symmetric monoidal structure on\nSt(HotA,\u2022 ), making the morphism\nA \u2212\u2192 HotA \u2212\u2192 St(HotA,\u2022 )\nsymmetric monoidal; see Proposition 5.3, Theorem 6.1, and Proposition A.11. This\nmonoidal structure coincides with the one of Theorem A.15, thanks to the uniqueness\nof the latter.\n\n\f54\n\nD.-C. CISINSKI & G. TABUADA\n\nA.9. Spectral enrichment. - Recall from [11, Appendix A.3] that any triangulated derivator D is canonically enriched over spectra, i.e. we have a morphism of\nderivators\nRHom(\u2212, \u2212) : Dop \u00d7 D \u2212\u2192 HO(SpN ) .\n\nMoreover, this enrichment over spectra is compatible with adjunctions : given an\nadjunction\n\u2032\nD\nO\n\u03a6\n\n\u03a8\n\n\u000f\n\nD\nwe have a canonical isomorphism in the stable homotopy category of spectra :\nRHomD\u2032 (\u03a6X, Y ) \u2243 RHomD (X, \u03a8Y )\n\nX \u2208 D, Y \u2208 D\u2032 .\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
