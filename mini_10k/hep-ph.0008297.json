INTRODUCTION\n\nThe origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( UHECRs ) is one of most mysterious puzzles\nin astrophysics [1]. UHECRs with energies \u223c 1020 eV can not travel in distance more than\n50 Mpc owing to the interactions between UHECRs and the cosmic background radiations\n[2]. Observations, however, show that there are no visible candidates for the generators of\nsuch UHECRs in the arrival directions of UHECRs. There are several models of generators\nfor UHECRs, but none of them give satisfactory explanations. They are divided into two\ncategories [3]. One is conventionally astrophysical models, and the other one Are particle\nphysical models. It is explained in astrophysical models that the generator could be an object\nsuch as neutron star, active galactic nuclei or the same astrophysical object as generators of\ngamma ray bursts. It is explained in particle physical models that UHECRs could be caused\nby hypothetical objects such as cosmic string [4], magnetic monopole [5], super heavy relic\nparticles decaying today [6], e.t.c.. The astrophysical models have a difficulty that cosmic\nrays can not be accelerated to such high energies. On the other hand, the particle physical\nmodel has difficulties concerning to production rate of UHECRs and a large number of\ntheoretical assumptions on hypothetical objects.\nThe origin of gamma ray bursts ( GRBs) is also one of most mysterious puzzles in\nastrophysics [7]. Some of their energies reach \u223c 1054 erg in the case of spherical emission\nof the burst. It is very difficult to find a model explaining such a huge energy. There are,\nhowever, several models proposed. They are also divided into two categories, astrophysical\none and particle physical one. Since conventional astrophysical explanation are optimistically\nbelieved to have no serious problems, particle physical one is not urgently needed so that no\nsuch serious model is pursued. Conventionally, astrophysicists consider that the generator\ncould be merger of neutron star-neutron star, neutron star-black hole or the collapstar (\ncollapse of extremely massive star ), e.t.c.G recently, there are a number of growing evidences\nsupporting that GRBs with long duration are caused by the collapse of extremely massive\nstar. These models are optimistically believed to explain the properties of GRBs such as\namount of energies released, baryon contamination of eject, afterglow spectrum, e t c.. But\nowing to difficulties in the treatment of MHD involving neutrinos and unknown properties in\nthe fluid of nucleons, there is no successful model among them. In particular, the problem of\nthe baryon contamination seems difficult to be solved in conventional astrophysical models.\nOn the other hand, in some particle physical models, axions or other unknown weakly\ninteracting particles are used to overcome the baryon contamination problem based on the\nconventional astrophysical engines. Moreover, in other particle physical models, one claims\nthat the engine is collapse of mirror star [8], cosmic string [9] or collision between axion star\nand neutron star [10]. The engine in these model is associated with dark matter; mirror\nmatter, cosmic string or axion.\nAmong these candidates for dark matter, the axion [11\u201313] is the most plausible one.\nProbably, some of axions may form boson stars ( axion stars ) in the present Universe by\ngravitational cooling [14] or gravitational collapse of axion clumps formed at the period of\nQCD phase transition [15]. In this paper we explain a generation mechanism [10] of UHECRs\nand GRBs, and discuss their production rates. Our mechanism for both phenomena is\ncollision between axion stars and neutron star. Different strength of the magnetic field at\nthe surface of the neutron star yields these different phenomena, i.e. UHECR and GRB.\n2\n\n\fFurthermore, the axion stars can be plausible candidates for gravitational microlenses (\nMACHO [16] ) with an appropriate choice of the axion mass; the choice is taken in our\nmodel for explaining huge energies \u223c 1054 erg in GRBs and extremely high energies \u223c 1020\neV in UHECRs. It is intriguing that the masses of the axion stars become those of the\ncandidates for MACHOs with this choice of the axion mass. We also show that the collisions\ncause emission of observable monochromatic radiations from the axion stars [17]. We can\ncheck the validity of our model by detecting the radiations.\nWe have previously proposed [10] a possible generation mechanism of gamma ray burst\n( GRB ). According to the mechanism the collision between axion star and neutron star\ngenerates a gamma ray burst; the axion star dissipates its mass energy [10,18] very rapidly\nunder the strong magnetic field of the neutron star. Thus, the energy released in the collision\nis given by the mass Ma of the axion star. Typically, Ma \u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 (10\u22125 eV/ma ) where ma\n( M\u2299 ) denotes the axion mass ( solar mass ). In the previous analysis we have taken the\nmass, ma \u223c 10\u22125 eV, as suggested observationally in standard invisible axion models. The\nmass of axion star, Ma \u223c 1049 erg, corresponding to this choice, however, is not enough to\nexplain a huge energy \u223c 1054 erg observed in GRB980123 even if moderate jet is assumed\nin the GRB: If the solid angle of the jet is given by \u03a9, the energy released in the GRB is\nabout 1054 \u03a9/4\u03c0 erg.\nIn the present paper, we assume that the axion mass is given by ma \u2243 10\u22129 eV, although\nthe choice is not conventional [12,19]. Then, we can explain that the energies of GRBs can\nreach the huge energies \u223c 1054 erg. We can also show [10] that cosmic rays are accelerated\nto the energies \u223c 1020 eV.\nThe essence of both phenomena is that a strong electric field \u223c 1015 (B/1012 G) eV cm\u22121\nis induced in the axion star when it is located under magnetic field B of a neutron star. This\nelectric field can accelerate charged particles to the huge energies \u223c 1020 eV in the case of\nB > 1012 G, although such a strong electric field is unstable against electron positron pair\nproductions. On the other hand, weaker and more stable electric field dissipates its energy\nin magnetized conducting medium of neutron star. In particular, in the case of neutron\nstars with relatively weak magnetic field \u2264 1010 G, the axion star collides directly with\nthem and its whole energy is dissipated very rapidly in their outer crust owing to the energy\ndissipation of the electric field. This rapid energy dissipation produces jet of baryons, which\nleads to emission of GBRs. In the case of strong magnetic field > 1012 G, however, the\naxion star evaporates before colliding directly with the neutron star; the evaporation occurs\nowing to the instability of such a strong electric field against electron-positron pairs creation\n[20]. Therefore, the axion star decays into electron positron pairs which are accelerated to\nthe energies \u223c 1020 eV by the electric field during its decay. In both cases the energies\nreleased are given by the mass of the axion star. Since the mass of the axion star is given\nby \u223c 10\u22121 M\u2299 \u2243 1053 erg with the assumption of ma \u2243 10\u22129 eV, the energy \u223c 1054 erg\nobserved in some GRBs can be explained by assuming a moderate jet of the GRBs. Thus\nthe collisions between the axion stars and the neutron stars are possible sources of both\nUHECRs and GRBs. Additionally, it turns out that the axion star is a plausible candidate\nfor MACHO [16] because the value of the mass Ma is suitable for explaining the observations\nof MACHOs. Since all of baryonic candidates for MACHOs seem to have serious difficulties\n[21], nonbaryonic ones like the axion stars would be favored.\nWe also discuss that the collisions generate monochromatic radiations with a frequency\n3\n\n\fma /2\u03c0 \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 105 Hz. Their flux is sufficiently large to be observed. With the detection of\nsuch radiations we can test our model and determine the axion mass.\nIt is reasonable to think that some of axion stars gravitationally attract matters, i.e.\nH and He in the Universe and have baryon contamination, while the other ones have no\nsuch contamination. Then, the axion stars with the baryon contamination produce protons\nas UHECRs in the collision with neuron stars. On the other hand the other ones produce\nphotons as UHECRs, which are generated in fireball of electron-positron pairs. Therefore,\nUHECRs produced in our mechanism are either protons or photons.\nIn the section ( 2 ) we describe the properties of the axionic boson stars for latter\nconveniences. In the section ( 3 ) we explain how the axion star induces an electric field\nunder an external magnetic field. In particular, we show that the axion star is electrically\npolarized in spite of the neutrality of the axion itself. In the section ( 4 ) we describe how\nthe electric field can accelerate charged particles to the energies \u223c 1020 eV. Such a strong\nelectric field can be produced only around a neutron star with magnetic field > 1012 G. In\nthe section ( 5 ) we explain a generation mechanism of GRBs by noting that the electric\nfield dissipates rapidly its energy in conducting medium of neutron star. In the section ( 6 )\nwe show that our generation mechanism of UHECRs and GRBs gives the rate of the energy\nrelease consistent with the observations. In the section ( 7 ) we point out an observational\nsignal of our mechanism, that is, electromagnetic radiations from axion star rotating around\nneutron star. The existence of such an observational signal is distinctive feature of our\nmodel. We summarize our results in the final section ( 8 ).\nII. AXION STARS\n\nLet us first explain axion stars ( ASs ), which are ones of most realistic boson stars.\nThe axion is a Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with Pecci-Quinn symmetry, which was\nintroduced for solving strong CP problem. The mechanism is the most plausible one for the\nproblem. The symmetry is broken spontaneously at large energy scale, fP Q \u223c 1012 GeV.\nBut since the symmetry is anomalous, it is also broken dynamically by the effects of QCD\ninstantons. Therefore, the axion obtains a mass, ma .\nThe AS is a coherent object of the real scalar field a(x) describing the axion. It is a\ngravitational bound state of axions represented by a solution [23,24] of the equation of the\naxion field coupled with gravity. An approximate form of the solution [24] without nodes is\nobtained in the limit of small mass Ma << M\u2299 ,\na(x) = fP Q a0 sin(ma t) exp(\u2212r/Ra ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t ( r ) is time ( radial ) coordinate and fP Q is the decay constant of the axion; there\nare solutions with nodes but their energies are much higher than that of this solution. The\nvalue of fP Q is constrained conventionally from cosmological and astrophysical considerations\n[12,13] such that 1010 GeV < fP Q < 1012 GeV. The axion mass ma is given in terms of\nfP Q such that ma \u223c 10\u22122 GeV2 /fP Q . But, when we assume entropy productions below\nthe temperature 1 GeV in the early Universe, we may be released from the constraints\n[25]. Hereafter we assume that fP Q \u223c 1016 GeV or ma \u223c 10\u22129 eV for explaining huge\ncharacteristic energies of UHECRs and GRBs.\n4\n\n\fIn the formula, Ra represents the radius of an AS which has been obtained [24] numerically in terms of mass Ma of the AS;\n\u22121\nRa = 6.4 m2pl /m2a Ma \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 105 cm m\u22122\n9 (10 M\u2299 /Ma ),\n\n(2)\n\nwith m9 = ma /10\u22129 eV and mpl is Planck mass. Similarly, the amplitude a0 in eq(1) is\nrepresented such that\na0 = 1.73 \u00d7 102 (105 cm/Ra )2 m\u22121\n.\n9\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore, we find that the solution is parameterized by one free parameter, either one\nof the mass Ma or the radius Ra : Once we choose either of mass Ma or radius Ra of an AS,\nthe whole properties of the AS are determined only in terms of the axion mass ma ( Ma and\nRa\u22121 should be less than a critical value mentioned soon below ).\nIt is also important to note that the solution is not static but oscillating with the frequency of ma /2\u03c0. It has been demonstrated [26] that there is no static regular solution of\nthe real scalar massless field coupled with gravity. This may be general property of the real\nscalar massive field like the axion field. In fact, the oscillation in the solutions cause emission of electromagnetic radiations under a magnetic field, which is a general phenomenon\nexpected in axions exposed to the magnetic field. On the other hand, static solutions [26]\nof boson stars exist in the complex scalar field.\nWe should comment that the solution (1) can represent approximately solutions even\nwith larger masses. More general solutions [23] with larger masses have higher oscillation\nmodes such as sin(3ma t), sin(5ma t) e t c.. But their amplitudes are much smaller than a0 .\nThe AS mass is determined by physical conditions under which the AS has been formed;\nhow large amount of cloud of axions are cooled gravitationally to form the AS, etc.. The\nsituation is similar to other stars such as neutron stars or white dwarfs. A typical mass\nscale in these cases is the critical mass [27]; stars with masses larger than the critical mass\ncollapse gravitationally into more compact ones or black holes. In the case of the AS, there\nalso exists a critical mass Mc which is given by [23]\nMc \u2243 10\u22121 M\u2299 m\u22121\n9 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe ASs with masses larger than this one collapse into black holes. Therefore, we may\nadopt this critical mass Mc as a characteristic mass scale of the ASs. The corresponding\nradius Ra of the ASs with this critical mass is given such that Ra \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 105 m\u22121\n9 cm. (\nThe critical mass is the maximal mass, which ASs can take. Thus, their masses, in general,\nare smaller than this one. Since energies of ASs released in GRBs are given by their masses,\nthe maximal energy in GRBs is given by the critical mass ).\nWe wish to comment that a critical mass for stars like neutron stars, white dwarfs etc.,\nrepresents order of masses they possess actually in the Universe. For example, the masses\nof the neutron stars are in a region of 1.0M\u2299 \u223c 1.6M\u2299 , while the critical mass of neutron\nstar is given by about 2M\u2299 . Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the characteristic\nmass of the axion star is the order of the critical mass, Mc .\nAlthough the gravitational cooling for ordinary star formation is in general ineffective\nbecause it is too slow process, it has been shown [14] that the cooling is very effective for\nthe real scalar axion field. Thus, the axion stars can be easily formed gravitationally in a\n5\n\n\fgas of the axions. It is reasonable to assume that the most of the axions in the Universe\nforms the axion stars.\nUntil now, we do not consider a case that the axion star has an ordinal matter, i.e. H\nand He. It is very natural to consider a possibility that the axion attracts gravitationally\nsuch matters after its formation. In the case the star is composed of the axions and the\nmatters. The amount of the matters would be no more than the critical mass of the axion,\nunless it collapses into a black hole. It turns out below that such axion stars with matter\ncontamination play role for emitting protons as UHECRs in the collision with neutron stars.\nIII. AXION STAR UNDER EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD\n\n~\nLet us explain how an AS induces an electric field under an external magnetic field B,\nin particular, that of a neutron star. Owing to the interaction between the axion and the\nelectromagnetic field described by\n~ * B/f\n~ P Q\u03c0 ,\nLa\u03b3\u03b3 = c\u03b1a(x)E\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the value of c ( of the order of unity ) depends on axion models [28,29,13], the Gauss\nlaw is modified [30] such that\n~ = \u2212c\u03b1\u2202~ * (a(x)B)/f\n~\n\u2202~ E\nP Q \u03c0 + \"matter\" .\n\n(6)\n\nThe last term \"matter\" denotes electric charges of ordinary matters. The first term in\nthe right hand side represents an electric charge made of the axion. Although the axion is\nneutral, it can possess an electric charge under a magnetic field owing to the interaction eq(5).\nThe interaction mixes electric and magnetic sectors. Thus, the axion star is electrically\npolarized under the magnetic field. ( This polarization is oscillating and so there exist a\n~ P Q \u03c0; it can be read by checking other\ncorresponding oscillating current, Ja = c \u03b1 \u2202t a(x)B/f\nMaxwell equations. Thus, radiations are emitted by the AS, which might be observable. We\nwill discuss it in later section. ) Accordingly, the electric field E~a is induced;\n~ P Q\u03c0 ,\nE~a = \u2212c \u03b1 a(x) B/f\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2243 1/137. Numerically, its strength is given by\nEa \u223c 1015 eV cm\u22121 B12 m9\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwith B12 = B/1012 G, where we have used the solution in eq(1) for the critical mass.\nObviously, the spatial extension of the field is given by the radius Ra \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 105 m\u22121\n9 cm of\nthe AS. Therefore, we find that the electric field is much strong around a neutron star with\nmagnetic field \u223c 1012 G. This electric field is an engine of UHECRs in our model.\nIt should be mentioned that the existence of the electric field is originated in the coherence\nof axions composing axion star. Incoherent axions can be converted into incoherent photons\nunder a magnetic field. But, they never induce electric field with large spatial extension.\nThis electric field causes UHECRs and GRBs. Thus, it is essentially important in our\ndiscussion that the axions are coherent in axion stars.\n6\n\n\fWe should also mention that electromagnetic radiations from the axion star are caused by\nthe interaction5 which transforms axions to photons under magnetic field. This is the same\nphenomenon as one in Sikivie-type axion detectors [31]; incoherent axions are converted into\nphotons in the detector. In the case of coherent axions, oscillating electric current is induced\ndue to the oscillation of the coherent axions themselves, as we have shown above. Hence, it\nis very general property for the solutions of axion star to oscillate in time.\nIV. GENERATION MECHANISM OF ULTRA HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAYS\n\nThe ultra high energy cosmic rays with energy > 1020 eV pose a serious challenge for\nconventional theories of origin of cosmic rays. Such high energy cosmic rays can not travel\nin distance of more than 50 Mpc due to the interaction between the cosmic rays and the\ncosmic background radiation, or infrared background. But there are no candidate astrophysical sources like active galaxy nuclei in the directions of the UHECRs. Eight events\nof UHECRS have been detected and the detection rate is approximately once per year and\nper 100 km2 . There are no conventional astrophysical and particle physical explanation for\nthese observations.\nHere we explain the events with a mechanism of the collision between axion stars and\nneutron stars with strong magnetic field > 1012 Gauss. Under such a strong magnetic field\nthe axion star induces strong electric field, which can accelerate charged particles to the\nenergy > 1020 eV. The electric field induced in the axion star is oscillating with the frequency,\nma /2\u03c0 \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 105 m9 Hz. Thus a particle with electric charge Ze can be accelerated by\nthe field in a direction within the half of the period, \u03c0/ma or to a distance \u2243 Ra ( \u223c\n\u03c0/ma \u00d7 light velocity ), unless it collides with other particles within the period. Thus, the\nenergy \u2206E obtained by the particle is given by\n\u2206E = Ze Ea \u00d7 \u03c0/ma \u00d7 light velocity \u223c 1020 Z eVB12\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore, the electric field can accelerate the charged particle to the energy \u223c 1020 Z eV.\nThese charged particles may be baryons contaminated in AS or electron-positron pairs produced by the decay of the electric field itself. Note that the direction of the acceleration\nis parallel to the magnetic field. Thus the energy lose of the accelerated particles due to\nsynchrotron emission is not important in the acceleration region.\nComment is in order. It seems apparently from eq(9) that stronger magnetic fields\nyield cosmic rays with higher energies. Stronger magnetic fields, however, induce stronger\nelectric fields, which are unstable against electron-positron pair creations. Therefore, strong\nmagnetic fields do not necessarily yield cosmic rays with higher energies.\nIf the particles collide with other particles on the way of acceleration, in other words,\ntheir mean free paths are shorter than Ra , they can not obtain such high energies. It is easy\nto see, however, that the mean free paths of quarks or leptons with much higher energies\nthan their masses are longer than Ra in magnetosphere of neutron star. This is because\nsince cross sections, \u03c3, of quarks or leptons with such energies E behaves such as \u03c3 \u223c 1/E 2 ,\nmean free paths \u223c 1/n\u03c3 is longer than Ra \u223c 105 cm unless number density n of particles\naround the AB is extremely large ( i.e. n > 1044 /cm3 for E = 1020 eV ). Obviously, under\nthe electric field eq(8), the particles can obtain energies higher than their masses \u223c 1 MeV\nby moving parallel to the electric field only in the distance of \u223c 10\u22129 cm.\n7\n\n\fThe point in the acceleration is that as the electric field is much strong, charged particles\ncan gain much energies by moving in a short distance. The mean free path becomes larger\nas the particles gain more energies. Thus, under the strong electric field the particles can\ngain effectively the energies without losing their energies.\nAs is well known, the strong electric field is unstable [20] against electron-positron pair\ncreations. Thus the field decays when the magnetic field of the neutron star is strong\nsufficiently. This implies that AS itself decays into the pairs.\nLet us estimate the decay rate of the field and show that the AS decays before colliding\ndirectly with a neutron star whose magnetic field at surface is stronger than 1012 G. We also\nshow that the AS can collide directly with a neutron star whose magnetic field is relatively\nweak \u2264 1010 G.\nThe decay rate Rd of the field per unit volume and per unit time is given by [20]\nRd =\n\n\u221e\n\u03b1Ea2 X\nexp (\u2212m2e \u03c0n/eEa )\n\u03c0 2 n=1\nn2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere me denotes electron mass. The rate is very small for an electric field much weaker\nthan m2e \u03c0 \u223c 4 \u00d7 1016 eV/cm. The electric field of AS, however, can be very strong and it\ncan be comparable to m2e \u03c0. Therefore, the rate is much large. Numerically, it is given by\n2\nRd \u223c 1047 B12\nm29 cm\u22123 s\u22121\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nexp(\u22120.7 \u00d7 102 n/B12 m9 )/n2 .\n\n(11)\n\nn=1\n\nSince the spatial extension of the field is approximately given by 105 m\u22121\ncm, the total\n9\n\u22121 \u22121 P\u221e\n62 2\n2\n2\ndecay rate W of the field in AS is \u223c 10 B12 m9 s\nn=1 exp(\u22120.7 \u00d7 10 n/B12 m9 )/n .\nNumerically, it reads\nW \u2243 10/s for B12 = 0.5,\n\nW \u2243 106 /s for B12 = 0.55,\n\nW \u2243 1032 /s for B12 = 1\n\n(12)\n\nwith m9 = 1.\nTherefore, we find that the AS decays very rapidly ( or almost suddenly ) when it\napproaches a region where the strength of the magnetic field reaches a critical value of about\n1012 G. Hence, the AS evaporates before colliding with the neutron star whose magnetic field\nat the surface is stronger than 1012 G. The whole energy of the AS is transmitted to electronpositron pairs, each of which can obtain energies \u223c 1020 eV. These particles are emitted into\na cone with very small solid angle. They form an extremely short pulse whose width being\nless than millisecond. Actually, when we suppose that the relative velocity of the AS is\nequal to light velocity, it decays approximately within a period of 10\u22124 sec \u223c 10\u22125 sec; in\nthe period it passes the region where the magnetic field increases from 0.5 \u00d7 1012 G to 1012\nG. These leptons may be converted into baryons and photons through the interactions with\nthemselves, interstellar medium or ejection of progenitor of the neutron star. In particular,\nthe energies of the leptons are transmitted mainly to those of photons. Therefore, high\nenergy photons are emitted as ultra high energy cosmic rays in the collision, when the\nmagnetic field is sufficiently strong.\nOn the other hand, high energy protons are emitted in the collision between neutron star\nand axion star with matter contamination. Such a matter can be accelerated to the ultra\nhigh energy before the axion star decays. The amount of the protons emitted as UHECRs\n8\n\n\fdepends on the matter contamination in the axion star. We expect that almost of the same\namount of protons with that of the leptons are emitted in such a collision.\nWe comment that the velocity of AS trapped gravitationally to a neutron star, is approximately given by the light velocity just when it collides with the neutron star. This is\nbecause an AS is trapped to a neutron star when the AS approaches it within a distance\n\u223c 1011 cm where its potential energy dominates over its kinetic energy. After that, the AS\ngoes around the neutron star, losing its potential energy and angular momentum by emitting\ngravitational and electromagnetic waves. Finally, the AB collides with it. Thus, the velocity\nof the AS reaches approximately the light velocity when it collides with the neutron star.\nWe have to examine the number density of the leptons produced during the decay of AS\nand have to check whether or not the density is less than 1045 /cm3 ; the particles can not\nobtain the ultra high energies \u223c 1020 eV unless the number density surrounding AS is not\nbeyond the value quoted. They collide with other particles on the way of the acceleration\nand lose their energies. Suppose that the mass Ma of AS is transmitted to the energy of\nelectron-positron pairs. Then, their number is given by \u223c Ma /me . They may be produced\nin the volume Ra3 of AS. If we assume that they remain to stay in the volume after their\nproduction, the number density is \u223c Ma /me Ra3 \u2243 1044 /cm3 . Actually, the pairs escape in\na direction pointed by the electric field within the life time of the field 10\u22124 sec \u223c 10\u22125 sec.\nThus, the real number density in AS is less than 1044 /cm3 . Therefore, we find that the\nnumber density of the pairs produced from the decay of AS is not so large to interrupt them\nobtaining the ultra high energies.\nWe can see from eqs(9) and (11) that the critical electric field depends on the factor of\nB12 \u00d7 m9 , while the energy \u2206E obtained by accelerated charged particles depends only on\nthe factor of B12 . Therefore, we find that if axion mass ma is smaller than 10\u22129 eV, the\nmaximal energy of cosmic rays can be larger than 1020 eV when a neutron star has strong\nmagnetic field B > 1012 G. For instance, if ma = 0.2\u00d710\u22129 eV, the cosmic rays with energies\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 1020 ZeV can be produced when a neutron star has magnetic field > 5 \u00d7 1012 G at\nthe surface.\nV. GENERATION MECHANISM OF GAMMA RAY BURSTS\n\nGamma ray bursts are observed daily from sources extending out to those of the most\ndistant galaxies in the Universe. Duration of the bursts ranges from millisecond to thousand\nseconds. Pulse shape structures vary much from bursts to bursts. Typical energies of the\ngamma rays observed are of the order of 0.1 MeV. A mysterious puzzle of these bursts is the\nhuge amount of energies released in the bursts. Some of the bursts carry energies \u223c 1054 erg\nwhen spherical explosion from sources is assumed. Furthermore, baryon contamination in\nfire balls of the explosion is less than 10\u22124 M\u2299 . Therefore, it is very difficult to make realistic\nastrophysical models for explaining these properties, although it is believed optimistically\nthat the origin of these phenomena would be some known astrophysical objects, such as\nmerger of neutron star - neutron star, collapse of extremely massive star, etc.\nHere, we explain a particle physical generation mechanism of gamma ray bursts. According to the mechanism, we can understand the problems of the huge energies released and the\nbaryon contamination. But it is still difficult to understand the variant of the durations and\nthe pulse shapes. The bursts are possibly produced in the collision between AS and neutron\n9\n\n\fstar with relatively small magnetic field such as \u2264 1010 G. In such a weak magnetic field, the\nAS collides directly with the neutron star and dissipates its whole energy in an outer crust\nof the neutron star. Actually, the decay rate W of the electric field is negligibly small for the\ncase of the weak magnetic field \u2264 1010 G. Thus the AS does not decay before colliding directly with such a neutron star. The AS, however, decays in magnetized conducting medium\nsuch as the outer crust of neutron star. Namely the electric field of the AS induces electric\ncurrent in the crust, which dissipates its energy owing to finite electric conductivity of the\ncrust. Thus, the AS decays very rapidly by dissipating its energy. Consequently, particles\nof the crust are emitted as a jet in the collision, which forms fireball emitting gamma ray\nbursts.\nWe will estimate the rate of the energy dissipation in the outer crust with use of the\nconductivity, \u03c3 = 1026 /s [32]. The value of the conductivity, in general, depends on physical\nparameters of the crust such as temperature, composition, density, etc.. The value of \u03c3 we\nuse, however, is a typical one of the crust and does not vary so much even if we change the\nparameters of the density, temperature, or composition within a reasonable range.\nWe calculate [10,18] the rate Wdis of the dissipation per unit time and unit volume as\nfollows,\nWdis =\n\nZ\n\nAS\n\n\u03c3Ea2 d3 x/\n\nZ\n\nAS\n\n= 4c2 \u00d7 1061 /(4\u03c0/3Ra3 ) erg/s\n\n\u2243 2.4 \u00d7 1045 erg/s cm3\n\nB2\nm2 ,\n1026 /s (1010 G)2 9\n\u03c3\n\nMa\nB2\n1026 /s 10\u22121 M\u2299 (1010 G)2\n\u03c3\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nwhere we have used the solution in eq(1) for the critical mass. The integration has been\nperformed over the volume ( = 4\u03c0Ra3 /3 ) of an AS, which has been supposed to be involved\ncompletely in the conducting medium. Thus it represents an average rate of the energy\ndissipation in the outer crust.\nWe find that the energy dissipation proceeds very rapidly in the medium. We compare\nthe rate with the energy density of the AS, which is given by 1037 erg/cm3 . Hence, we find\nthat the AS dissipates the whole energy \u223c 1053 erg in the outer crust even if it rushes into\nthe medium with the light velocity; the depth of the crust is equal to several hundred meters.\nIt never reaches the core of the neutron star.\nThis very rapid energy release leads to the ejection of the particles composing the crust.\nThe ejection could be emitted into a cone with small solid angle as a jet. This is because\nthe particles ( mainly irons ) of the neutron star are accelerated and emitted in the direction\nparallel to the strong electric field \u223c 1013 B10 eV/cm. The particles are accelerated to\nenergies \u223c 1018 eV, while their characteristic energies inside the crust are \u223c 106 eV. Thus,\nwe expect that solid angle of the jet is much small, although the particles do not necessarily\nobtain such high energies because of loosing energies by the collisions with others. The fact\nthat the whole energy of AB is dissipated only in the outer crust, implies that the ejection are\nonly particles composing the crust. Thus a fraction of the baryon contamination in the jet is\nless than 10\u22125 M\u2299 as required observationally. We expect that a large amount of neutrinos\nwith high energies is also produced in the collision with the rapid energy dissipation. The\nneutrinos burst can be observed in future observatory although it has lost the direction\npointing to a source of a GRB in which it was born. This is our generation mechanism of\ngamma ray bursts with energies \u223c 1053 erg.\n10\n\n\fIn the above case, the AS dissipates its whole energy in the first collision. On the other\nhand, an AS may collide several times with a neutron star when its mass is much smaller\nthan the critical mass \u223c 10\u22121 M\u2299 ; the mass has been assumed as a characteristic mass scale\nof ABs. We see from the general formula eq(2) of Ra that the radius of the AS with smaller\nmass than the critical one is larger than the critical radius \u223c 105 cm. For example, if its\nmass is given by 10\u22122 M\u2299 , the radius is about 106 cm. This is comparable to the radius of\nthe neutron star. Hence, the collisions may occur several times. Such an AS never loose\nits whole energy in the first collision. How many times the collisions occur depends on the\ncollision parameters. Unless the centers of both stars are on the straight line parallel to the\nrelative velocity, the whole energy of AS does not dissipate in the first collision. There could\nbe several collisions after the first collisions. The electric field induced in the AS is also small\ncompared with the one mentioned above; Ea \u223c 1011 eV cm\u22121 B10 m9 , for Ma = 10\u22122 M\u2299 .\nThus, the energies of the particles emitted from the neutron star are much smaller than\n1018 eV. Furthermore, since the rate of the energy dissipation becomes smaller in the case\nof AS with smaller mass, the rate of the energy release is also smaller. It means that jet\nemitted in the collision is softer; its flux ( and energies of each particles ) is smaller than\nthat of a jet emitted from the collision of AS with the critical mass. The total energies\nreleased ( \u223c 1052 erg for Ma = 10\u22122 M\u2299 ) are also smaller than 1053 erg. We expect that\nthese collisions generate gamma ray bursts with long duration and soft gamma rays. On the\nother hand, gamma ray bursts with short duration and hard gamma rays are produced in\nthe first collision in which the whole energy is dissipated completely.\nWe should comment that when the axion star with much matter contamination collides, the jet ejected from the collision may contain baryon contamination much larger than\n10\u22125 M\u2299 . Thus in such a collision, Lorentz factor of the jet is not so large that gamma ray\nbursts may not be produced.\nVI. RATE OF ENERGY RELEASE IN UHECRS\n\nWe now wish to estimate an energy release rate in the collisions between ASs and neutron\nstars. We assume that UHECRs are produced in the collision of neutron stars with relatively\nstrong magnetic field > 1012 G and that GRBs are produced in the collision of neutron stars\nwith relatively weak magnetic field \u2264 1010 G. Thus it is assumed that all of neutron stars\nare divided into those with B > 1012 G and those with B \u2264 1010 G. We take the fraction\nof the neutron stars with B > 1012 G to be f ; 0 < f < 1. Although the collisions may\noccur, in general, in the whole Universe, we estimate the rate of the collision which arises in\na galaxy. Thus the real rate is larger than a rate in our estimation. Furthermore, we assume\nthat the dark matter is composed mainly of axion stars. In particular a hale is composed\nof the axion stars. The estimation, however, involves several ambiguities associated with\nnumber density of neutron stars, energy density of dark matter or velocity of ASs in the\nUniverse etc. Therefore the estimation does not lead to a conclusive result although our\nresult is consistent with the observations [1].\nFirst we assume that almost of all neutron stars are mainly located around a galaxy in\nwhich they were born. We also assume that their distribution is uniform in a halo of the\ngalaxy whose size is supposed to be given by 50kpc. Our result does not depend on the\nprecise value of the size although it depends on mean energy density of the dark matter in\n11\n\n\fthe halo. Thus the collision between neutron star and axion star arises in the halo. The\nnumber of the neutron stars located around a galaxy is supposes to be \u223c 109 ; the present\nrate of appearance of supernovae in a galaxy is about 0.1 \u223c 1 per 10 year and the rate of the\nappearance could be larger in early stage of the galaxy than the one at present. Therefore,\nthe number density \u03c1 of the neutron stars would be given such that \u03c1 \u2243 109 /(50kpc)3 .\nv\nAll of these neutron stars are assumed to possess either strong magnetic field > 1012 G or\nweak magnetic field \u2264 1010 . Furthermore, to estimate the rate of the energy release we need\nto know average density \u01eb of the dark matter, i.e. density of axion stars. Here we use a value\n[12] of \u01eb \u2243 0.5\u00d710\u221225 g/cm3 , which represents a local density of our halo: Our result depends\non \u01eb linearly. Using these parameters we can estimate the rate owing to the collision between\nthe AS and the neutron star. The collision takes place as a result of AS losing angular\nmomentum and potential energy soon after AS being trapped gravitationally to a neutron\nstar. Thus, we estimate the cross section for a neutron star to trap an AS in the following.\nNamely an AS is trapped by the neutron star when the AS approaches the neutrons star\nwithin a distance Lc in which its kinetic energy Ma v 2 /2 is equal to its potential energy\n1.5 \u00d7 M\u2299 Ma G/Lc around the neutron star. G is gravitational constant. Here the mass of\nthe neutron star and the relative velocity v are assumed to be 1.5 \u00d7 M\u2299 and 3 \u00d7 107 cm/s,\nrespectively. Thus, the cross section is found such as L2c \u03c0 with Lc \u2243 6 \u00d7 1011 cm. The lose of\nits potential energy and angular momentum would be caused by the emission of gravitational\nand electromagnetic waves; electromagnetic radiations arise due to the oscillating current\nJa . It also takes place by the interaction between the electric field of AS and plasma wind\nfrom neutron star. The detail calculation has not yet been done. It will be clarified in future\npublication.\nAnyway, under the assumptions, we obtain the rate of the collision between neutron star\nand axion star per Mpc3 and per year,\n(\u01eb/10\u22121 M\u2299 \u00d7 \u03c1 \u00d7 L2c \u03c0 \u00d7 v \u00d7 1 year)/(20)3 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 /Mpc3 year.\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we have obtained the rate per a galaxy with its volume (50kpc)3 and have divided\nit with (20)3 to get the rate per Mpc3 . This rate is divided into the rate of production of\nUHECRs and the rate of production of GRBs.\nHere we comment that the rate heavily depends on the relative velocity v: L2c \u00d7 v \u223c v \u22123 .\nThus if we choose a value v = 2 \u00d7 107 cm/s, the rate is given by \u223c 10\u22129 /Mpc3 year. Thus\nour result involves an ambiguity of the order of 10.\nSince the energy of \u223c 1053 erg is released in the collision, we find that the rate of the\nenergy release as UHECRs is given by\n\u223c (3 \u00d7 1043 \u223c 1044 ) f erg/Mpc3 year.\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we assumed that the whole energy released is transmitted to UHECRs or GRBs. Our\nresult does not include the contributions from collisions arising far outside of a galaxy. The\nreal rate is larger than the rate in our estimation. Thus we may conclude that the result\nroughly agrees with the observation. It is well known that both rates of energy release in\nUHECRs and GRBs are nearly the same with each other. It implies that the fraction of\nthe neutron stars with B > 1012 G is nearly the same with the fraction of neutron stars\n12\n\n\fwith B \u2264 1010 . Taking account of several ambiguities in the parameters used above and the\nrough estimation, we can say simply that our model can explains roughly the observations\n[1].\nVII. OBSERVATIONAL SIGNAL OF AXION STARS\n\nWe have discussed our model for generation mechanisms of UHECRs and GRBs. These\nare generated in the collision between axion star and neutron star. An significant question\nis how we can check observationally our model. Since we have supposed that dark matter\nin Universe is composed mainly of axion stars, observation of the axion stars is important\nfor checking validity of our model. There are several attempts of the detection of the axion\nitself. These attempts use axions conversion into photons under magnetic field in terrestrial\nexperiments. But there are no attempts to observe axion stars. Since a collision between an\naxion star and the earth is very rare, we need to detect signals from the axion stars located\nfar away from the earth.\nHere we wish to discuss the observation of two types of signals from the axion stars. One\nis associated with gravitational lensing and the other one associated with monochromatic\nradiations from the ASs.\nIt was very intriguing to detect microgravitational lens effects associated with the halo of\nour galaxy. Since the first observations have been reported, several candidates for MACHOs\nhave been proposed. Observationally, it is necessary for the candidates to have masses M\nroughly such as 0.1 \u00d7 M\u2299 < M < 0.7 \u00d7 M\u2299 . Since we have assumed that the halo of our\ngalaxy is composed of ASs and their mass is \u223c 10\u22121 M\u2299 , the ASs are plausible candidates\nfor the MACHOs. As has been recognized, baryonic candidates like white dwarfs, neutron\nstars, etc. have serious problems. Nonbaryonic candidates are favored [21]. The problems are\nassociated with chemical abundance of carbon and nitrogen in the Universe: If these baryonic\nstars are MACHOs, an overabundance of the elements is produced far in excess of what is\nobserved in our galaxy. Hence, the ASs are theoretically the most fascinating candidates\nfor the MACHOs as nonbaryonic ones. They are also candidates for the generators of both\nUHECRs and GRBs. If the most favorable mass of the MACHO is 0.5M\u2299 , we need to\nchoose ma \u2243 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 eV since the mass of the ASs is given by \u2243 10\u22121 M\u2299 /m9 . We note\nthat smaller axion mass leads to stronger electric field as well as larger mass of AS. Thus, it\nyields higher energies of the UHECRs, \u223c 5 \u00d7 1020 eV and of GBRs, \u223c 5 \u00d7 1053 erg than the\nones we have claimed above. Accordingly, the determination of the mass of MACHOs gives\nthe upper limit of both the energies of the ultra high energy cosmic rays and the energies\nreleased in the gamma ray bursts in our mechanism.\nWe point out another way of the observation of the axion stars. Since the electric field\nEa as well as electric current Ja induced in ASs is oscillating, electromagnetic radiations\nare emitted [24,34]; the frequency of these monochromatic radiations is \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 105 m9 Hz\n( their wave length is given by \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 105 /m9 cm. ) Their flux is stronger as the magnetic\nfield imposed on AS is stronger. AS revolves around neutron star, loosing its potential\nenergy and angular momentum, and then collides with it. In the revolution, AS emits the\nradiations with flux depending on the strength of the magnetic field. Hence, we expect that\nsuch radiations with maximal flux can be detected just in advance of UHECRs. Their flux is\nstrongest among others just before UHECRs being emitted; the magnetic field is strongest\n13\n\n\fwhen the AS decays into charged particles. It is easy to estimate their luminosity [34] by\nevaluating gauge potential Ai ,\nZ\n\n1\nc\u03b1\u03c3a0 Bi\nJa (t \u2212 R0 + ~x * ~n) d3 x =\nR0 AS\n\u03c0R0\n4c\u03b1ma a0 Bi\nRa3\n=\nsin ma (t \u2212 R0 ) ,\nR0\n(m2a Ra2 + 1)2\n\nAi =\n\nZ\n\nAS\n\nsin ma (t \u2212 R0 + ~x * ~n) exp(\u2212r/Ra )d3 x (17)\n(18)\n\nwhere R0 ( ~n ) denotes a distance ( direction ) between ( from ) the neutron star and ( to )\nthe earth. We have integrated the current Ja over the AB, which is located near the neutron\nstar. Thus, the luminosity L of the radiations is given by\nRa6\n(m2a Ra2 + 1)4\n2\n\u2243 6.7 \u00d7 1041 B12\nerg/s,\n\nL = 4c2 \u03b12 a20 m4a B 2\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nwith c = 1. If the emission arises in a distance \u223c 10 Mpc from the earth, we obtain the\n2\nflux at the earth, \u223c 109 Jy B12\n/m9 ; we have assumed that the velocity of the AS revolving is\n\u223c 0.1\u00d7 light velocity. Although the possibility of observing the radiations is very intriguing,\nit might be difficult to detect the radiations with such a low frequency because they could\nbe absorbed by interstellar ionized gases before arriving the earth. v\nThe author wishes to express his thank to all the staffs in Theory Group, Tanashi Branch,\nHigh Energy Accelerator Research Organization for their warm hospitality extended to him.\nThis work is supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of\nEducation, Science and Culture of Japan No.10640284\n\n14\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] M.A. Lawrence et al.
