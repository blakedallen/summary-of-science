This is also underlined by the fact that coherent backscattering\nis still observed even in the chaotic regime.\nPACS numbers: 42.25.Dd 42.65.sf 42.65.-k\n\nAs first described by Anderson in 1958, the impact\nof disorder on the transport properties of waves, depending on the dimensionality and the disorder strength,\nranges from weak to strong localization. In the case\nof matter waves, the localization of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) is, at present, a very active research\ntopic investigated by several experimental and theoretical\ngroups [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], in particular with the recent\nobservation of the (1D) localization of matter waves in a\ndisordered optical potentials [9, 10]. Although, in these\nexperiments, the atom-atom interactions were negligible,\nthe basic question remains how effects of interference between multiply scattered waves, such as weak or strong\nlocalization, are affected by interactions.\nBEC's in disordered potentials appear to be good candidates to study these questions, since, in the mean field\nregime, the condensate is still described by a single coherent wave function governed by a nonlinear wave equation (Gross-Pitaevski equation). Thus, the condensate in\nprinciple retains its ability to display interference effects\nalso in presence of (not too strong) interactions. Similar\nnonlinear equations describe propagation of light in disordered nonlinear media [11]. In contrast, the situation\nis quite different in the case of electronic transport [12],\nwhere the interactions combined with finite temperature\neffects give rise to dephasing, which in general destroy\nthe disorder-induced coherent effects.\nEven if the theoretical description of coherent effects in\nnonlinear disordered systems is far from complete, an important step was done recently by the development of a\ndiagrammatic theory for coherent backscattering in presence of nonlinearity [13]. This approach relies on the assumption of a unique stationary solution of the nonlinear\nwave equation under consideration. This assumption is\nexpected to be valid for very weak nonlinearities (which,\nhowever, may still considerably affect the height of the\ncoherent backscattering cone [8, 13]). On the other hand,\n\nit is known that larger nonlinearities can induce speckle\ninstabilities, such that no stationary state is reached at\nlong times [8, 14]. A clear explanation for the physical\norigin of this effect, however, is still missing. Theoretical\npredictions of the nonlinearity threshold above which instabilities develop, were attempted in [11, 15], but, to our\nknowledge, these results have not yet been confirmed by\nexperiments or numerical simulations. For this reason,\nwe investigate, in this letter, the dynamical properties of\nthe speckle patterns generated by nonlinear point scatterers.\nMore precisely, we consider an assembly of N pointlike scatterers located at randomly chosen positions ri ,\ni = 1, . . . , N , inside a sphere of volume V illuminated\nby a plane wave kL . The field amplitude Ei at scatterer\ni results as the sum of the incident wave and the field\nradiated by all other scatterers:\nEi = eikL *ri +\n\nX eik|ri \u2212rj |\ndj ,\nk|ri \u2212 rj |\n\n(1)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere k = |kL | = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, and the field amplitudes are\nmeasured in units of the incident plane wave amplitude.\ndj describes the dipole induced inside scatterer j. For\nsimplicity, we will consider only scalar fields in this letter.\nAs for the induced\n\u0001 dipole, we consider a nonlinear response d = g |E|2 E, with\ng(I) = i\n\nei\u03b1I + 1\n.\n2\n\n(2)\n\nFor \u03b1 = 0, this model corresponds to a resonant point\nscatterer. The nonlinearity \u03b1 induces a phase shift proportional to the local intensity I, which amounts to a\nshift of the scatterer's resonance frequency. For small \u03b1,\nEq. (2) reduces to a \u03c7(3) -nonlinearity; furthermore, for\nreal values of \u03b1, the optical theorem is fulfilled, ensuring\nenergy conservation. The above set of N complex equations (1), with the replacement (2), is formally written as\n\n\fRe(\u03bb)min\n\n|\u03bb|min\n\nIout\n\n2\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.0\n\nsolution persisting at long time, only if these solutions\nare dynamically unstable. To investigate the dynamical\nbehaviour, we use the following relaxation model for the\ntime evolution of the dipole d(t):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n \u0307 = \u2212 \u0393 d(t) \u2212 g(I)E) ,\n(4)\nd(t)\n2\nwhere \u0393/2 corresponds to the inverse relaxation time. E\nand I are now the instantaneous local field and intensity.\nWe assume \u0393 \u001c c/R, such that the field propagation\ncan be considered as instantaneous within the radius R\nof the cloud. According to this model, small deviations\n\u03b4E(t) = E(t)\u2212Est from the stationary solution Est fulfill\nthe following set of equations:\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) For a given random configuration\nof N = 1000 scatterers with density n\u03bb3 = 1, the top plot\ndepicts the backward intensity Iout as a function of the nonlinearity strength \u03b1. For \u03b1 > 0.3, several stationary solutions\ncoexist. The middle plot shows the smallest module of all\neigenvalues of the stability matrix M. At each turning point,\nM exhibits a vanishing eigenvalue. The bottom plot depicts\nthe smallest real part of all eigenvalues of M. The dashed\nline indicates the stability threshold defined by Re(\u03bb) = 0.\nAt \u03b1 ' 0.1, the solution becomes unstable, and the instability then increases with \u03b1.\n\nF(E, \u03b1) = 0, where F and E are real vectors of dimension\n2N .\nStarting from the linear solution (\u03b1 = 0) for a given\nconfiguration of the scatterers, a numerical scheme, based\non a Newton-Krylov method, allows to continuously follow the solution E(\u03b1), which fulfills\n\u2202F\ndE\n= \u2212M\u22121\nd\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202F\nwith the Jacobian matrix M = \u2202E\n. If M has a vanishing\neigenvalue, this gives rise to a turning point in the curve\nE(\u03b1), such that several solutions of Eq. (1) coexist for\nthe same value of \u03b1.\nAs an example, we plot in Fig. 1 (top) the intensity\nIout , scattered into the direction opposite to the incident\nwave as a function of \u03b1, for a specific configuration of\nN = 1000 scatterers randomly distributed in a sphere\nwith density n = N/V such that n\u03bb3 = 1. For \u03b1 = 0,\nthese parameters correspond to mean free path ` = 20/k\nand optical thickness (measured along the diameter 2R of\nthe sphere) 2R/`0 = 4. In Fig. 1 (top), we clearly notice\nthe existence of several stationary solutions for \u03b1 > 0.3,\nand in particular for \u03b1 > 0.6 (see inset). Fig. 1(middle)\nshows the smallest module |\u03bb|min of all eigenvalues of the\nmatrix M. At every turning point, the curve |\u03bb|min (\u03b1)\ntouches the horizontal axis, as expected.\nHowever, even if multiple stationary solutions coexist,\none will observe speckle instability, i.e. a time dependent\n\n\u0393\n \u0307\n\u03b4E(t)\n= \u2212 M\u03b4E,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nHence, the stationary solution is stable if all eigenvalues of the matrix M have a positive real part. In Fig. 1\n(bottom), we plot the smallest real part of all eigenvalues along the stationary solution shown on the top. Just\nabove \u03b1 = 0.1, the solution becomes unstable and the\ninstability increases with \u03b1. Furthermore, in the region\nof multiple solutions (see around \u03b1 = 0.5, for instance),\nthe different solutions have different instability rates. As\na closer inspection reveals, the branch between the two\nturning points is the most unstable one, exactly like in\nthe standard bistability scheme [16]. However, whereas\nin the usual scheme the two other branches would correspond to stable solutions, leading to a bistable behavior,\nthey are, in the present case, also unstable.\nIn summary, Fig. 1(bottom) reveals that, for the specific configuration of scatterers under consideration, no\nstable stationary solution exists for \u03b1 > 0.1. Hence, we\nexpect that, in this regime, the actual dynamics of the\nsystem does not converge towards a stationary state, but\nremains time-dependent even in the long-time limit. This\nis confirmed by Fig. 2, where we plot, for the same configuration of scatterers as in Fig. 1, the backscattered\nintensity as a function of time for different values of the\nnonlinearity strength \u03b1. One clearly observes a transition\nfrom the stable stationary solution at \u03b1 = 0 to a chaoticlike behavior at \u03b1 = 1. For intermediate values, stable\nperiodic solutions are obtained, indicating that, for those\nvalues, the stationary solutions are already unstable. Let\nus stress that the bifurcation from the stable to the unstable regime does not necessarily occur at values of the\nnonlinearity for which many stationary solutions coexist.\nIndeed, since our dynamical system has a very large number of degrees of freedom (2N ) and, in addition, is not\na Hamiltonian one, many possible bifurcation scenarios\nare in principle possible, including for example strange\nattractors [17]. A more detailed analysis would require\nthe complete determination of the underlying dynamical\nstructure (periodic orbits, limit cycles...), which is beyond the scope of this Letter.\n\n\f\u03b1=0.6\n\u03b1=0.8\n\u03b1=1.0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n\u22121\n\n800\n\n1000\n\ntime (\u0393 )\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 2: Typical evolution of the intensity in the backward\ndirection as a function of time for the same configuration of\nscatterers as in Fig. 1, and for different values of the nonlinearity strength \u03b1. One clearly observes a transition from a\nstable stationary solution for \u03b1 = 0 to a chaotic-like behavior\nfor \u03b1 = 1. For intermediate values, stable periodic solutions\nare obtained, emphasizing that, for those values, the stationary solutions are already unstable.\n\nThe preceding discussion refers to a given single configuration of scatterers. Although it has been chosen as a\nrepresentative example of the transition to the unstable\nregime, more information can be obtained when performing a statistical analysis of the system properties over an\nensemble of different configurations. Fig. 3 (top) displays\nthe cumulative distributions of instability thresholds, denoted Pinst (\u03b1), for different system parameters. Hence,\nwe have plotted, for different numbers N and optical densities n\u03bb3 of scatterers, the proportion of unstable configurations as a function of the nonlinearity strength \u03b1.\nAs expected, if we fix the number of scatterers, the instability occurs earlier (i.e. the distributions are shifted\ntowards smaller \u03b1) for increasing density (i.e. disorder\nstrength). On the other hand, if we fix the density, instable configurations are more frequently encountered with\nincreasing number of scatterers (i.e. system size). However, both variations are not independent: as the figure\nclearly reveals, the statistical distribution depends only\non a single parameter, namely p = N \u00d7 n\u03bb3 . In particular, the average threshold, h\u03b1inst i, depends linearly on\np\u22121 , see Fig. 3 (bottom, left).\nAs we have checked, for large p, the resulting instability\nthresholds are small enough so that first order perturbation theory with respect to the nonlinearity strength \u03b1\ncan be applied. Hence, we expect the statistics of instability thresholds to be closely related to properties of the\nlinear system, in particular the real parts of the eigenvalues of M(\u03b1 = 0). The latter define the decay rates \u0393s of\nthe linear system [18, 19]. Since the occurence of a single\nnegative eigenvalue is already sufficient for the instability\nto occur, the state with the smallest decay rate (or, equivalently, longest lifetime) attains a particular importance.\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nnon-linearity \u03b1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-3\n\n6\n\n-1\n\n(10 p)\n\np=500\n\np=1000\n\ns\n\n\u03b1=0.4\n\n3\n\nN=1000 n\u03bb =1.0\n3\nN=1000 n\u03bb =0.5\n3\nN=500 n\u03bb =1.0\n3\nN=1000 n\u03bb =0.25\n3\nN=500 n\u03bb =0.5\n3\nN=250 n\u03bb =2.0\n\nc\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\nP (\u0393 )\n\n\u03b1=0.0\n\nPinst(\u03b1)\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.6\n0.3\n0.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0\n\n<\u03b1inst>\n\nbackward intensity\n\n3\n\n8\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\np=250\nN=2000\nN=1000\nN=500\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\ns\n\n\u0393 /\u0393\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) On the top, the cumulative distributions of instability thresholds are plotted for different numbers\nN and densities n\u03bb3 of scatterers.

And indeed, we find the distributions to be governed by the same parameter p = N \u00d7 n\u03bb3\nwhich also determines the statistics of instability thresholds. From these data, the average value \u0393/ h\u0393s i, i.e. the\nlongest lifetime, is found, as a crude estimate, to scale\nlike p2/3 . This time is much longer than the Thouless\ntime, i.e the longest time predicted within diffusion approximation, which, in \u0393\u22121 unit, scales like (pn\u03bb3 )2/3\n(i.e. the square of the optical thickness). This difference strongly emphasizes that interference effects, which\nenhance the lifetime of a particular single mode with respect to the diffusive Thouless time, are deeply involved\nin the speckle instability. Due to its long lifetime, such\na \"prelocalized\" mode [20] almost behaves like a perfect\ncavity, and is therefore much more severely affected by\nthe nonlinearity than short-lived modes and, thus, eventually allows instability to settle. We note that a similar\nargument was also put forward to explain the appearance\nof discrete peaks in the emission spectrum of the coherent random laser [21]. Let us note that the instability\nthreshold of our nonlinear point scatterers system differ\nfrom the one predicted in the case of linear scatterers\n\n\f4\n2.0\n\u03b1=0.0\n\u03b1=0.3\n\u03b1=0.5\n\u03b1=0.6\n\u03b1=0.8\n\u03b1=1.0\n\u03b1=1.5\n\nbackward intensity\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u03b8/\u03c0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Configuration average of the intensity\nhI(\u03b8, t)i, scattered at time t = 1000\u0393\u22121 , in the direction \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 = 0 corresponds to exact backscattering, for 1000\ndifferent configurations of N = 1000 scatterers with density\nn\u03bb3 = 1. Although the coherent backscattering cone at first\ndecreases with increasing nonlinearity, the occurence of a dip\nat larger nonlinearities proves that coherent effects survive in\nthe time dependent regime \u03b1 & 0.3, and even in the fully\nchaotic one \u03b1 & 1.\n\nin a \u03c7(3) nonlinear medium [11], for which no instability\nshould occur if the nonlinearity is small enough for first\norder perturbation theory to apply. Further research is\nnecessary in order to characterize the relevant properties of nonlinear disordered systems, leading to different\nscenarios for the development of speckle instabilities.\nFinally, we address the question of coherent transport\nin the unstable regime. For this purpose, we compute\nthe coherent backscattering (CBS) cone hI(\u03b8, t)i, i.e. the\nconfiguration average of the intensity scattered at a time\nt in the direction \u03b8, where \u03b8 = 0 corresponds to the exact\nbackward direction. Numerically, we observe that after,\ntypically, few 100\u0393\u22121 , the average intensity hI(\u03b8, t)i becomes time-independent. We plot this stationary value as\na function of \u03b8 in Fig. 4, where the average is performed\nover 1000 random configurations with the same parameters (N = 1000 and n\u03bb3 = 1) as for the configuration\nexamined in Figs. 1 and 2. Obviously, the net effect of\nthe nonlinearity is the reduction of the CBS cone height,\nand the formation of a dip at larger nonlinearities [8]. According to the theory presented in [13], this effect can be\nqualitatively explained by a dephasing between reversed\nscattering induced by the nonlinearity. In the present\ncontext, however, the most important point is that a coherent effect still survives in the time dependent regime\nat \u03b1 & 0.3, and even in the fully chaotic one at \u03b1 & 1.\nA possible explanation can be put forward when considering the time evolution depicted in Fig 2: the typical\ntimescale is much larger than the scatterer response time\n\u0393\u22121 , such that the intensity pattern is almost fixed for a\nphoton scattered along short paths inside the medium.\nIn summary, using a model of nonlinear point scatterers, we have analysed the dynamical instability proper-\n\nties of the speckle patterns, and observed the transition\nfrom a regime with a unique, stable and stationary solution towards chaotic-like behavior. In addition, we have\nshown that the statistical properties of the instability\nthresholds are determined by the same parameter as the\nsmallest decay rates of the linear system, putting thus\nforward the crucial role played by interference effects for\nthe speckle instabilities. Furthermore, we have shown\nthat, quite surprisingly, the coherent backscattering effects are not erased in the time dependent regime, even\nnot in the chaotic one. Obviously, it would be very interesting to perform similar studies in the strongly localized\nregime (k` . 1). Although our argument based on the\ndecay rates of the linear system would then suggest the\nappearance of instabilities for any small amount of nonlinearity, our results also leave open the possibility to\nobserve strong localization even in presence of nonlinearity, depending on the timescale on which the instabilities\ndevelop.
