A detailed investigation is presented of the energy-momentum tensor approach\nto the evaluation of the force acting on a rigid Casimir cavity in a weak gravitational\nfield. Such a force turns out to have opposite direction with respect to the gravitational\nacceleration. The order of magnitude for a multi-layer cavity configuration is derived and\nexperimental feasibility is discussed, taking into account current technological resources.\n\n1\n\n\f1. Introduction\nAlthough much progress has been made in the evaluation and experimental verification of\neffects produced by vacuum energy in Minkowski space-time it remains unclear why the\nobserved universe exhibits an energy density much smaller than the one resulting from\nthe application of quantum field theory and the equivalence principle. Various hypotheses\nhave been put forward on the interaction of virtual quanta with the gravitational field. For\ninstance some arguments seem to suggest that virtual photons do not gravitate [1], while\nother authors have suggested that Casimir energy contributes to gravitation [2]. So far it\nseems fair enough to say that no experimental verification that vacuum fluctuations can\nbe treated according to the equivalence principle has been obtained as yet, even though\nthere are expectations, as we agree, that this should be the case.\nMotivated by all these considerations, our paper computes the effect of a gravitational\nfield on a rigid Casimir cavity, evaluating the net force acting on it. The order of magnitude of the resulting force, although not allowing an immediate experimental verification,\nturns out to be compatible with the current extremely sensitive force detectors, actually\nthe interferometric detectors of gravitational waves. We evaluate the force acting on this\nnon-isolated system at rest in the gravitational field of the earth by studying the regularized energy-momentum tensor and recovering the same result as mode by mode evaluation\nwith the assumption that virtual photons do gravitate and suffer gravitational read shift.\nThe associated force turns out to have opposite direction with respect to gravitational\nacceleration. Orders of magnitude are discussed bearing in mind the current technological resources as well as experimental problems, and physical relevance of the analysis is\nstressed.\n2. Evaluation of the force\nIn order to evaluate the force due to the gravitational field let us suppose that the cavity\nhas geometrical configuration of two parallel plates of proper area A = L2 separated by\nthe proper length a. The system of plates is taken to be orthogonal to the direction of\ngravitational acceleration ~g .\n\n2\n\n\fIn classical general relativity, the force density can be evaluated according to [3]\nf\u03bd = \u2212 \u221a\n\n\u0011 1 \u2202g\n\u2202 \u0010p\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c3\n\u03bc\nT ,\n\u2212det\ng\nT\n\u03bd +\n2 \u2202x\u03bd\n\u2212det g \u2202x\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T \u03bc\u03bd is the energy-momentum tensor of matter, representing the energy densities of\nall non-gravitational fields, and gravity couples to T \u03bc\u03bd via the Einstein equations: R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n1\n2 g\u03bc\u03bd R\n\n= 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd . However, we are eventually interested in quantum field theory in\n\ncurved space-time, where gravitation is still treated classically, while matter fields are\nquantized. At this stage the key assumption is that one can take the expectation value\nof the quantum energy-momentum tensor in some state and evaluate the external force as\nif it were a classical force. This should therefore represent the expectation value of the\n\"quantum force\" in the given state. According to this theoretical model, we have to find\nthe regularized energy-momentum tensor hT \u03bc\u03bd i and insert it into the right-hand side of\nEq. (1) to find eventually hf\u03bd i. If we were in Minkowski space-time with metric \u03b7, we\nmight exploit the result of Ref. [4], according to which\n\nhT\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03c0 2 h\u0304c\ni=\n180a4\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u1e91 \u03bc \u1e91 \u03bd\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u1e91 \u03bc = (0, 0, 0, 1) is the unit spacelike 4-vector orthogonal to the plates' surface. If\nsuch an analysis is performed for an accelerated but locally orthonormal reference frame\nin curved space-time, corresponding to our system at rest in the earth's gravitational field,\nthe Minkowski line element should be replaced by the line element near the observer's\nworld line and this reads (neglecting possible rotation effects)\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2Aj xj )(dx0 )2 + \u03b4jk dxj dxk + O\u03b1\u03b2 (|xj |2 )dx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 .\n\n(3)\n\n~ (with components (0, 0, |~g|)), the observer's acceleration with respect to the local\nHere c2 A\n\nfreely falling frame, shows up in the correction term \u22122Aj xj to g00 , which is proportional\nto distance along the acceleration direction. Note that first-order corrections to the line\n\n3\n\n\felement are unaffected by space-time curvature. Only at second order, which is beyond\nour aims, does curvature begin to show up. With this understanding we find, on setting\n\nK\u2261\n\n\u03c0 2 h\u0304c\n,\n180a4\n\n(4)\n\nthat the non-vanishing components of the regularized energy-momentum tensor which\ncontribute to hfz i are\n3\nK\n1\nhT 33 i = hT 33 i = \u2212 K; hT 00 i = \u2212\n.\n4\n4 1 + 2Az\n\n(5)\n\nSince (of course x3 \u2261 z and hence hf3 i denotes hfz i)\n\u0011 1 \u2202g\n1\n\u2202 \u0010\u221a\n\u03b7\u03c1 \u03b7\u03c1\n\u03bc\n1 + 2AzT 3 +\nhfz i = \u2212 \u221a\nT =\n\u03bc\n2 \u2202z\n1 + 2Az \u2202x\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n1\nK+ K\n4\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nA\n,\n1 + 2Az\n\n(6)\n\nwe find for the component of the full force along the z-axis the formula\nhFz i \u223c\n= aL2 hfz i \u223c\n= aL2 gK,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere integration over the volume V = aL2 has reduced to a simple multiplication by aL2\nto our order of approximation.\nInterestingly, the resulting force has opposite direction with respect to the gravitational acceleration. Note also that the force density in Eq. (6), and hence the force itself in\nEq. (7), is the sum of two terms: the latter, proportional to g K\n4 , arises from the Casimir\nenergy encoded into T 00 , and can be interpreted as the Newtonian repulsive force (i.e.\n\"push\") on an object with negative energy. The former term, proportional to 43 gK, results\nfrom the pressure along the acceleration axis and can be interpreted as the mass contribution of the spatial part of the energy-momentum tensor. With this understanding, our\nresult agrees with the equivalence principle, according to which for every pointlike event of\nspace-time, there exists a sufficiently small neighbourhood such that in every local, freely\nfalling frame in that neighbourhood, all laws of physics obey the laws of special relativity\n(as a corollary, the gravitational binding energy of a body contributes equally to the inertial\n4\n\n\fmass and to the passive gravitational mass). In particular, we agree with the statement\nthat a system with a given rest energy momentum tensor T 00 has the inertial mass tensor\nmij = T 00 \u03b4 ij + T ij .\nFurthermore, it is very important to note that, when considering the total force acting\non the real cavity, which is an isolated system, the contribution to the force resulting from\nthe spatial part of the energy-momentum tensor is balanced by the contribution of the\nmechanical energy-momentum tensor, and hence should not be considered for experimental\nevaluation. The resulting force is then the Newtonian force on the sum of the rest Casimir\nenergy and rest mechanical mass: the contribution of vacuum fluctuations leads to a\ngravitational push on the Casimir apparatus expressed by the formula\n\u03c0 2 L2 h\u0304c g\n~ \u223c\n~er ,\nF\n=\n720a3 c2\n\n(8)\n\nwhich should be tested against observation. As far as we can see, our calculation suggests\nthat the electromagnetic vacuum state in a weak gravitational field is red-shifted, possibly\nadding evidence in favour of virtual quanta being able to gravitate, a non-trivial property\non which no universal agreement has been reached in the literature [1,2], as we already\nnoticed in the introduction. To further appreciate this point, we now find it appropriate\nand helpful to show that the same result can be derived from a mode-by-mode analysis.\nRecall indeed that in Minkowski space-time the zero-point energy of the system can be\nevaluated, in the case of perfect conductors, as\n\u221e Z\nh\u0304cL2 X\nd2 k\nU=\n2 n=\u2212\u221e (2\u03c0)2\n\nr\n\nk2 +\n\n\u0010 n\u03c0 \u00112\na\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we have considered the normal modes labelled by the integer n and the transverse\nmomentum k. On performing the integral by dimensional regularization, the energy takes\nthe well known Casimir expression\n\nUreg = \u2212\n\n\u03c0 2 L2 h\u0304c\n,\n720a3\n\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere the final result is independent of the particular regularization method.\nConsider next the cavity at rest in a Schwarzschild geometry. On assuming that\nvirtual quanta do gravitate, and bearing in mind that the modes remain unchanged, the\np\n\u221a\n. Hence\nenergy of each mode is red-shifted by the factor g00 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1r , with \u03b1 \u2261 2GM\nc2\n\nthe total energy can be written as (the suffix S referring to Schwarzschild)\n\u221e Z\nh\u0304cL2 X\nd2 k\nUS =\n2 n=\u2212\u221e (2\u03c0)2\n\ns\u0012\n\nk2\n\n\u0010 n\u03c0 \u00112 \u0013 \u221a\n( g00 )2 .\n+\na\n\n(11)\n\nOn performing dimensional regularization one finds therefore\n1\n2\n\n(US )reg = (g00 ) Ureg\n\n\u03b1 \u0011 21 \u03c0 2 L2 h\u0304c\n=\u2212 1\u2212\n.\nr\n720a3\n\u0010\n\n(12)\n\nNow we assume that minus the gradient of (US )reg with respect to r yields the force exerted\nby the gravitational field on the rigid Casimir cavity. If r >> \u03b1, we find the result in Eq.\n(10) by working at the same level of approximation, so that the vacuum contribution to\nthe force acting on the cavity can be interpreted as the (lack of) weight of virtual photons\nthat are not allowed to resonate in the cavity.\n3. Towards the experimental verification\nIn considering the possibility of experimental verification of the extremely small forces\nlinked to this effect we point out that such measurements cannot be performed statically;\nthis would make it necessary to compare the weight of the assembled cavity with the sum\nof the weights of its individual parts, a measure impossible to perform. On the contrary,\nthe measurements we are interested in should be performed dynamically, by modulating\nthe force in a known way; the effect will be detected if the modulation signal will be higher\nthan the sensitivity of the detector. In this spirit we focus on the sensitivity reached by the\npresent technology in detection of very small forces on a macroscopic body, on earth, paying\nparticular attention to detectors of the extremely small forces induced by a gravitational\nwave. As an example, gravitational wave signals h of order \u2248 10\u221225 , corresponding to\nforces of magnitude \u2248 5 * 10\u221217 N at frequency of few tens of Hz, are expected to be\n6\n\n\fdetected with the Virgo gravitational wave detector presently under construction, after a\nmonth of integration time.\nIn the course of studying experimental possibilities of verification of the force on a\nrigid Casimir cavity, we evaluate this force on a macroscopic body, having essentially the\nsame dimensions of mirrors for gravitational wave detection and obtained through a multilayer sedimentation by a series of rigid cavities. Each rigid cavity consists of two thin\nmetallic disks, of thickness of order 100 nm separated by a dielectric material, inserted\nto maintain the cavity sufficiently rigid. By virtue of presently low costs and facility of\nsedimentation, and low absorption in a wide range of frequencies, SiO2 can be an efficient\ndielectric material.\nFrom an experimental point of view we point out that the Casimir force has so far\nbeen tested down to a distance a of about 60 nm, corresponding to a frequency \u03bdmin of the\nfundamental mode equal to 2.5 * 1015 Hz. This limit results from the difficulty to control\nthe distance between two separate bodies, as in the case of measurements of the Casimir\npressure. As stated before, in our rigid case, present technologies allow for cavities with\nmuch thinner separations between the metallic plates, of the order of few nanometers.\nAt distances of order 10 nm, finite conductivity and dielectric absorption are expected to\nplay an important role in decreasing the effective Casimir pressure, with respect to the\ncase of perfect mirrors [5]. In this paper we discuss experimental problems by relying on\ncurrent technological resources, considering cavities with plates' separation of 5 nm and\nestimating the effect of finite conductivity by considering the numerical results of Ref. [5];\nthis corresponds to a decreasing factor \u03b7 of about 7 * 10\u22122 for Al. Moreover, to increase the\ntotal force and obtain macroscopic dimensions, Nl = 106 layers can be used, each having\na diameter of 20 cm, and thickness of 100 nm, for a total thickness of about 10 cm. Last,\none should also consider corrections resulting from finite temperature and roughness of\nthe surfaces, although one might hope to minimize at least the former by working at low\ntemperatures.\nWith these figures, the total force F~ T acting on the body can be calculated with\nthe help of Eq. (8), modified to take into account the refractive index n for SiO2 , the\n\n7\n\n\fdecreasing factor \u03b7, the area A of disk-shape plates, and the Nl layers:\nA\u03c0 2 h\u0304c g\nF~ T \u2248 \u03b7Nl\n~er .\n720(na)3 c2\n\n(13)\n\nThis formula describes a static effect, while the need for a feasible experiment makes\nit mandatory to modulate the force, and various experimental possibilities are currently\nunder study. As first, we are investigating the possibility of modulating \u03b7, by varying\nthe temperature, so as to achieve a periodic transition from conductor to superconductor\nregime. In this case, making it impossible for the cavity to have modes at dielectric\nabsorption frequencies, the index n can be approximated to unity. By doing so one can\nobtain \u03b7max of order 5*10\u22121 [6], and the magnitude of the force at the modulation frequency\ncan reach 10\u221214 N . Even though such a force is apparently more than two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the force which the Virgo gravitational antenna is expected to\ndetect, we should consider that the signal there is at reasonable high frequency (some\ntens of Hz), while our calculated signal remains at lower frequencies, i.e. tens of mHz.\nMoreover, the technical problems resulting from stress induced in changing temperature\nrequire careful consideration before saying that modulation is feasible. For this reason\nwe are also estimating the possibility of building cavities which have, by construction,\nsome resonance frequencies at dielectric absorption frequencies. Calculations of efficiency\nof small length modulations under these conditions, to allow for a measurable signal, are\ncurrently being performed.\n4. Conclusions\nThe relation of the Casimir energy with the geometry of bounding surfaces is still under\ninvestigation, and another open problem of modern physics, i.e. the cosmological constant\nproblem, results from calculations which rely on the application of the equivalence principle\nto vacuum energy [1], and this adds interest to our calculations, that we have performed\nby focusing on a Casimir apparatus.\n\n8\n\n\fOur original contributions are given by the evaluation of the force acting on a macroscopic body which mimics the rigid Casimir cavity, and by a detailed estimate of the\nexpected order of magnitude of such a force.\nAs far as we can see, there is room left for an assessment of our investigation, i.e.:\n(i) how to make sure that the cavity is sufficiently rigid; (ii) the task of verifying that\ncorrugations or yet other defects do not affect substantially our estimates; (iii) how to\nperform signal modulation, which is still beyond our reach.\nThe experimental verification of the calculated force, which was our main concern,\nmight be performed if the problem of signal modulation could be solved. On the other\nhand, in the authors' opinion, the order of magnitude of the calculated force can be already\nof interest to demonstrate that experiments involving effects of gravitation and vacuum\nfluctuations are not far from what can be obtained with the help of present technological\nresources.\nAcknowledgments\nThe INFN financial support is gratefully acknowledged.
