Introduction\nThe quasar NRAO530 is a well known optically violently variable (OVV) extragalactic source with m pg \u223c 18.5 mag (Whelch\nand Spinrad 1973) at a redshift of 0.902 (Junkkarinen 1984).\nIt is an object of intensive observations at all wavelengths\nfrom radio to \u03b3-ray. Weak polarization of the source was detected both at optical and radio bands. NRAO530 was detected\nby ROSAT with 1.84 \u00d7 10\u22126 Jy at 1.3 keV (Brinkmann et\nal. 1994) and identified as a \u03b3-ray source by the Energetic\nGamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) with flux density\nof 4.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 Jy at 2.55 GeV (Fichtel et al. 1994; Thompson et\nal. 1995). The detection of the source in high frequency indicates that the evidence for relativistic bulk motion of the emitting plasma exists in its nucleus. A Doppler factor of 5.2 of\nNRAO530 was estimated by assuming that the particles and\nmagnetic field are in equipartition (Guuosa & Daly 1996).\nNRAO530 has been extensively monitored as a low frequency variable source (e.g., Bondi et al. 1994). Three epochs\nearly VLBI observations at 1.7 GHz showed the structure was\noriented in north-south direction extended to 25 mas in P.A.\u22127\u25e6\n(Romney et al. 1984, Bondi et al. 1994). The morphology of the\nmaps shows two-sided structures. Its complex structure variations are not readily interpretable as angular expansion because\nthe separation of components and the component sizes appear\nunchanged (Bondi et al. 1994).\nTwo epochs VLBI observations at 5 GHz showed a 4 mas\nslightly curved jet of the source towards to around the North direction, and no counter jet has been detected (Shen et al. 1997,\nand Hong et al. 1999). A jet-like feature extending approximately 5 mas from the core along P.A.\u223c 15\u25e6 was seen on the\nVLBI image at 8.5 GHz by Tingay et al. (1998).\nThe source underwent a dramatic radio outburst in 1995\nwith amplitude higher than any found over 30 years of monitoring (Bower et al. 1997). The creation of new components in the\njet associated with the outburst was revealed by their 86 GHz\n\nVLBI observation with one component (C1, their notation) to\na radio flare observed in mid of 1994 and another component\n(C2) to the 1995 outburst. The components moved to the southwest with apparent velocities of 7.4 and 7.9 h\u22121 c, respectively,\nby assuming the brightest component as the core (Bower et al.\n1997).\nThe 22 and 43 GHz VLBA monitoring of the source has\nbeen made during the flare in 1995 (5 epoch from 1994.45 to\n1996.90) by Jorstad et al. (2001). Based on better time sampling, they interpreted the evolution by assuming the south\ncomponent as the core and the brightness feature is the ejected\ncomponent during the flare. This results shows the structure\nand motion are both oriented roughly to the north with apparent velocities in the range of 7 to 29 h\u22121 c, with a stationary\nfeature to the north at the distance of \u223c 1.4 mas from the core\n(Jorstad et al. 2001).\nVLA observation of the source at 1.4 GHz showed an unresolved core and a second unresolved component 11\u2032\u2032 around\nin P.A. \u221290\u25e6 (Perley 1982) without evidence for a connection\nbetween the two (Romney et al. 1984).\nIn this paper, we focus on the extended radio emission\nof the source at the kpc scale and the relation between the\npc and kpc structures with EVN (European VLBI Network),\nMERLIN, and VLA observations at multi-frequencies.\n\n2. The observations and data reduction\nA full-track 7-hour EVN + MERLIN observation (EH004) of\nthe blazar NRAO530 was carried out at 5 GHz on February\n19, 1997. The EVN array comprised Effelsberg, Shanghai,\nCambridge, Jodrell Bank (Mark 2), Medicina, Noto, Onsala,\nUrumqi, WSRT, and Torun. The data were acquired with the\nMk III VLBI recording system in Mode B with an effective bandwidth of 28 MHz and correlated at the Max-Plank\nInstitut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie in Bonn. The EVN data were calibrated and fringe-fitted using the NRAO (Astronomical Image\n\n\f78\n\nX. Y. Hong et al.: EVN, MERLIN, and VLA Observations of NRAO530\n\n3. Results\n\n70\n\n3.1.

The jet first moved in P.A. 15\u25e6\nfor about 5 mas from the core, then turned sharply to the west\nand then the jet went to the North-East with the direction almost parallel to the first 5 mas jet.

The initial amplitude calibration was accomplished using the system temperature measurements made during the observations and the priori station\ngain curves.\nThe MERLIN array of the EVN + MERLIN observation comprised 6 antennas (Defford, Cambridge, Knockin,\nDarnhall, Mark 2, and Tabley). The central frequency was\n4.994 MHz and the observing bandwidth was 14 MHz.\nAn archive MERLIN data of NRAO530 at 1.6 GHz is available for our study. NRAO530 was observed as phase reference\nsource with snapshot mode for total 2 hours on source with 46\nscans over a period of 8 hours. The observation was carried out\non May 8, 1998. The MERLIN array consists of 7 antennas (the\nsame as above plus Lovell).\nThe quasar NRAO530 was observed with the VLA on Nov.\n27, 1992 at 8.4 GHz and on June 17, 2003 (AZ143) at 4.8\nGHz as a calibrator. The observations were carried out in snapshot mode. and used the standard VLA recording configuration\n(50 MHz bandwidth).\nPost-processing including editing, phase and amplitude\nself-calibration, and imaging of the data were conducted in the\nAIPS package. Natural weighting was used for imaging to obtain the extended emission.\n\nTo obtain the extended emission of the source, we tapered the\n5 GHz MERLIN data at 1 mega-wavelengths with a comparable resolution of the MERLIN data at 1.6 GHz. The 5 GHz\nMERLIN image shows a core-jet structure in P.A. \u223c \u221250\u25e6 on\nthe scale of about 1\u2032\u2032 and a distant component located at about\n11\u2032\u2032 west to the core. The west distant component extended in\nnorth-east to south-west direction and resolved into two components at resolution of 291 \u00d7 272 mas, \u221236.7\u25e6. No clear connection between the core and the west distant component was\ndetected in the MERLIN observation (Fig. 2).\nThe 1.6 GHz MERLIN image shows a similar morphology\nto the 5 GHz MERLIN image. The core-jet structure and the\nwest component are clearly detectable. Some week emission\nwith an arch shape connecting between the core and the distant\ncomponent has been detected in 1.6 GHz MERLIN observation\n(Fig. 3). This indicates that the west component is the lobe or\nhotspot of NRAO530.\n\n3.3. VLA images\nThe VLA images at 8.1 and 4.8 GHz (Figs. 4&5) confirm the\ndetection of the low emission between the core and the west\ndistant component (let's call it the west lobe). Both images exhibit the same track, like a ballistic trajectory, from the core to\nthe west lobe. This suggests that the emitting materials in the\nwestern lobe is powered by the nuclear source.\nA patch of weak diffuse emission is detected in the region\nabout 12.5\u2032\u2032 nearly east (PA=70 \u25e6 ) to the core, which appears\nto be a counter lobe of the source. No clear connection between\nthe east lobe and the core has been detected. However, the orientation of the milli-arcsec jet suggests that the lobe could be\nalso powered by the nuclear source.\n\n4. Conclusions and discussion\nOn the scale of parsec, NRAO530 appears to show that an oscillating jet consists of a number of emission components north\nto the core.\nOn the scale of kilo-parsec, the source exhibits a core jet\nstructure in P. A. \u221250\u25e6 and double lobe in the East-West direction. The west lobe is much stronger than the east lobe with\nthe ratio about 5.5 in intensity. The core showed a flat spectral index (\u03b1 = \u22120.02, S \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1 ), while the west lobe showed\na steep spectral index (\u03b1 = 0.8). Fig. 6 shows the spectrum\n\n\fX. Y.

The spectral indexes of the core and the west lobe.\nof the core component and the west lobe with the four epochs\nMERLIN and VLA data. Table 1 gives the spectral indexes of\nthe core component and the west lobe. A low emission are clear\ndetected between the core component and the west lobe, while\nthe connection between the core and the east lobe has not been\ndetected.\nIt is not clear why the jet bents almost 90\u25e6 from pc scale\nto kpc scale, which is not common for EGRET-detected AGNs\n(Hong et al. 1998). It may be caused by the interaction between\nthe jets and the interstellar medium (IMS) of the host galaxy.\nIt is also possible that the jet moves in a helical trajectory as\n1156+295 (Hong et al. 2004).\nAcknowledgements.
