[5]. The type A case is\ntreated in [29], [30] and extended to the B, C, D types in [32] and [18]. A modified\nversion of the A type construction is given in [17].\nIn the A type case, one considers the centralizer Am (n) of the subalgebra gl(n\u2212m)\nin the enveloping algebra U(gl(n)). It turns out that for each pair n > m there is\na natural algebra homomorphism Am (n) \u2192 Am (n \u2212 1) so that one can define a\nprojective limit algebra Am by using the chain of homomorphisms\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Am (n)\u2212\u2192Am (n \u2212 1) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Am (m + 1)\u2212\u2192Am (m).\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe algebra Am has a large center A0 which is isomorphic to the algebra of shifted\nsymmetric functions \u039b\u2217 (see [24]) and one has an isomorphism\nAm \u2243 A0 \u2297 Ym ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere Ym is the Yangian for the Lie algebra gl(m); [30, Theorem 2.1.15]. In particular, for each n \u2265 m there is a natural homomorphism\nYm \u2192 Am (n).\n\n(1.3)\n\nThis result was used in [2, 22, 17] to study the class of representations of Ym which\nnaturally arises from this construction. A similar result for the B, C, D types [32,\n18] was used in [14, 15, 16] to construct weight bases of Gelfand\u2013Tsetlin type for\nrepresentations of the classical Lie algebras.\nOur aim in the present paper is to extend these constructions to the series of the\nsymmetric groups S(n). Denote by Bm (n) the centralizer of the subgroup S(n \u2212 m)\nin the group algebra C[S(n)], where S(n \u2212 m) consists of the permutations which fix\neach of the indices 1, 2, . . . , m. It turns out that no natural analog of the chain (1.1)\nexists for the algebras Bm (n). Indeed, note that Bn (n) = Bn\u22121 (n) = C[S(n)] and\nso, by analogy with (1.1) we would have a homomorphism C[S(n)] \u2192 C[S(n \u2212 1)]\nidentical on C[S(n \u2212 1)]. But such a homomorphism does not exist for n > 4.\nOn the other hand, it was observed in [29] that an analog of (1.3) still exists: for\nany n \u2265 m there is a homomorphism Hm \u2192 Bm (n), where Hm is the degenerate\naffine Hecke algebra introduced by Drinfeld [6] and Lusztig [12]. This fact was used\n2\n\n\fby Okounkov and Vershik [25] to develop a new approach to the representation theory\nof the symmetric groups; see also earlier results by Cherednik [1].\nThis observation together with the semigroup method [28] allows one to expect\nthat an analog of the centralizer construction for the symmetric group should exist,\nwith the algebras C[S(n)] replaced with the semigroup algebras A(n) = C[\u0393(n)],\nwhere \u0393(n) is the semigroup of partial bijections of the set {1, . . . , n}. Alternatively,\nthe elements of \u0393(n) can be identified with (0, 1)-matrices which have at most one 1\nin each row and column. The semigroups \u0393(n) are studied in [28] and used to prove\nLieberman's classification theorem [11] for unitary representations of the complete\ninfinite symmetric group.\nTaking the centralizer Am (n) of \u0393(n \u2212 m) in A(n) instead of the algebras Bm (n)\nwe do obtain an analog of the chain of homomorphisms (1.1) for the algebras Am (n).\nThe corresponding projective limit algebra Am has a decomposition analogous to\n(1.2)\nem,\nAm \u2243 A0 \u2297 H\n\n(1.4)\n\nem is a 'semigroup analog' of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra Hm . The\nwhere H\nem can be presented by generators and defining relations. Moreover, the\nalgebra H\nem . The subalgebra A0 \u2286 Am is commutative\nalgebra Hm is a homomorphic image of H\nand isomorphic to the algebra of shifted symmetric functions \u039b\u2217 ; see [24] for a detailed\nstudy of the algebra \u039b\u2217 .\nThe mentioned above homomorphisms Hm \u2192 Bm (n) can be regarded as 'retracem \u2192 Am (n) whose existence is provided with the\ntions' of the homomorphisms H\ncentralizer construction for the symmetric groups.\nFinally, the algebra A is defined as the inductive limit of Am as m \u2192 \u221e. We\nshow that A naturally acts in the so-called tame representations of S(\u221e) and it can\nbe regarded as the 'true' analog of the group algebra C[S(\u221e)]. Indeed, contrary to\nthe finite case of C[S(n)], the algebra C[S(\u221e)] has a trivial center while A contains\na large center whose elements act by scalar operators in the tame representations of\nS(\u221e). Moreover, the central elements separate the irreducible tame representations.\nSome other generalizations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra Hm have been\nconstructed by Nazarov [20, 21].\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is preliminary. Here we define tame\nrepresentations of S(\u221e) and describe the properties of the semigroups \u0393(n); most\nof these results are contained in [28]. In Section 3 we construct the algebras Am as\nprojective limits of the centralizers Am (n). Section 4 describes the algebra A0 and\nestablishes its isomorphism with the algebra of shifted symmetric functions \u039b\u2217 . The\nmain results are given in Section 5 where we investigate the structure of Am and\ndescribe its relationship with the degenerate affine Hecke algebras.\n3\n\n\fThe authors acknowledge the financial support of the Australian Research Council.

The material of this section is based\non [28] and [27, \u00a72]. About applications of the semigroup method to representations\nof \"big\" groups, see Olshanski [31], Neretin [23].\n\n2.1\n\nConstructing tame representations\n\nLet N = {1, 2, . . . } and n \u2208 N. We denote by S(n) the group of permutations of the\nset Nn := {1, . . . , n}. We also regard S(n) as the group of permutations of N fixing\nn + 1, n + 2, . . . , and set\n[\nS(\u221e) =\nS(n).\nn\u22651\n\nThis is the group of all finite permutations of the set N.\nFor any m \u2264 n, we denote by Sm (n) the subgroup of permutations in S(n) fixing\n1, . . . , m, and set\n[\nSm (\u221e) =\nSm (n).\nn\u2265m\n\nNote that the subgroups S(n) and Sn (\u221e) of S(\u221e) commute. This simple observation\nwill play an important role later.\nFor a (unitary) representation T , we denote by H(T ) its (Hilbert) space.\nLet T be a unitary representation of the group S(\u221e). For n = 0, 1, . . . , denote\nby Hn (T ) the subspace of Sn (\u221e)-invariant vectors in H(T ). Since {Sn (\u221e)} is an\ndescending chain of subgroups, {Hn (T )} is an ascending chain of subspaces. Let\n[\nH\u221e (T ) =\nHn (T ).\nn\u22650\n\nSince S(n) and Sn (\u221e) commute, the subspace Hn (T ) is invariant with respect to\nS(n), and so, H\u221e (T ) is invariant with respect to the whole group S(\u221e).\nDefinition 2.1 A unitary representation T of the group S(\u221e) is said to be tame if\nH\u221e (T ) is dense in H(T ).\n\n4\n\n\fNote that for an irreducible representation T , this is equivalent to saying that\nH\u221e (T ) is nonzero.\nClearly, the trivial representation of S(\u221e) is tame, and another one\u2013dimensional\nrepresentation, s 7\u2192 sgn s, is not tame. Less trivial examples follow.\nExample 2.2 (i) Let H be the space l2 with its canonical basis e1 , e2 , . . . and let\nS(\u221e) operate in H by permuting the basis vectors. The representation H is tame.\nIt is irreducible and for any n the subspace Hn is spanned by e1 , . . . , en .\n(ii) The right (or left) regular representation of the group S(\u221e) in the Hilbert\n\u0001\nspace l2 S(\u221e) is not tame.\nFor any n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and any partition \u03bb \u22a2 n, we will construct a tame representation T\u03bb . First, if n = 0 then \u03bb = \u2205 and T\u2205 is the one-dimensional trivial\nrepresentation. Let now n \u2265 1 and let \u03c0\u03bb denote the irreducible representation of\nS(n) corresponding to \u03bb. Then T\u03bb is defined as the induced representation\nS(\u221e)\n\nT\u03bb = IndS(n)\u00d7Sn (\u221e) (\u03c0\u03bb \u2297 1)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere 1 stands for the trivial representation of Sn (\u221e). The representation T\u03bb can be\nrealized as follows. Let \u03a9(n) denote the set of injective maps \u03c9 : Nn \u2192 N. Define a\nright action of S(\u221e) on \u03a9(n) by\n\u03c9 * s = s\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c9,\n\ns \u2208 S(\u221e),\n\n(2.2)\n\nand a left action of S(n) by\nt * \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u25e6 t\u22121 ,\n\nt \u2208 S(n).\n\n(2.3)\n\u0001\nNote that these two actions commute. Consider the Hilbert space l2 \u03a9(n), H(\u03c0\u03bb )\nof H(\u03c0\u03bb )-valued square-integrable functions on \u03a9(n), and let H(n, \u03bb) be its subspace\nformed by the functions f (\u03c9) such that\nf (t * \u03c9) = \u03c0\u03bb (t)f (\u03c9),\n\nt \u2208 S(n),\n\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(n).\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe action of T\u03bb in H(n, \u03bb) is given by\n(T\u03bb (s)f )(\u03c9) = f (\u03c9 * s).\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe space H(T\u03bb ) may now be identified with H(n, \u03bb). For any l \u2265 n set\n\u03a9(n, l) = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(n) | \u03c9(Nn ) \u2286 Nl }\n5\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fand note that\n\u03a9(n) =\n\n[\n\n\u03a9(n, l)\n\n(2.7)\n\nl\u2265n\n\nAlso, set\nHl\u2032 (T\u03bb ) = {f \u2208 H(n, \u03bb) | supp f \u2286 \u03a9(n, l)},\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere supp f = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(n) | f (\u03c9) 6= 0}.\nProposition 2.3 For any n \u2208 N we have\n(\n{0}\nHl (T\u03bb ) =\nHl\u2032 (T\u03bb )\n\nif l < n,\nif l \u2265 n.\n\n(2.9)\n\nProof. Since Sl (\u221e) acts trivially on \u03a9(n, l), we have Hl\u2032 (T\u03bb ) \u2286 Hl (T\u03bb ). Conversely,\nlet f \u2208 Hl (T\u03bb ). Then the function kf (\u03c9)k2 is constant on any orbit of the subgroup\nSl (\u221e) in \u03a9(n). Since the sum of the kf (\u03c9)k2 taken over \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(n) must be finite,\nwe have kf (\u03c9)k = 0 unless the orbit containing \u03c9 is finite. But if \u03c9 \u2208\n/ \u03a9(n, l), then\nits orbit is clearly infinite, so that f (\u03c9) = 0. This proves the opposite inclusion\nHl (T\u03bb ) \u2286 Hl\u2032 (T\u03bb ).\n\nProposition 2.4 For any n \u2208 N and any \u03bb \u22a2 n, the representation T\u03bb of S(\u221e) is\ntame and irreducible.\nProof. By Proposition 2.3,\nH\u221e (T\u03bb ) =\n\n[\n\nHl (T\u03bb ) =\n\n[\n\nHl\u2032 (T\u03bb ).\n\n(2.10)\n\nl\n\nl\n\nThis is the subspace of finitely supported functions in H(T\u03bb ) = H(n, \u03bb) which is\nclearly dense. So, T\u03bb is tame.\nThe subspace Hn (T\u03bb ) = Hn\u2032 (T\u03bb ) is both cyclic in H(T\u03bb) and irreducible under the\naction of the subgroup S(n). This implies that T\u03bb is irreducible.\nWe shall identify any partition \u03bb with its Young diagram; see e.g. [13]. We write\n|\u03bb| = n if \u03bb has n boxes. Given two diagrams \u03bb and \u03bc the notation \u03bc \u0580 \u03bb will mean\nthat \u03bc can be obtained from \u03bb by removing one box, i.e. \u03bc \u2282 \u03bb and |\u03bc| = |\u03bb| \u2212 1.\nAn infinite tableau is defined as an infinite chain of diagrams\n\u03c4 = (\u03bb(1) \u0580 \u03bb(2) \u0580 . . . ),\n6\n\n|\u03bb(n) | = n.\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fTwo infinite tableaux will be called equivalent if the corresponding chains of diagrams\ndiffer in a finite number of places only.\nGiven an infinite tableau \u03c4 , we may construct an inductive limit unitary representation \u03a0(\u03c4 ) of the group S(\u221e) as follows. By the branching rule for the symmetric\ngroups (see e.g. [8], [25]), for any n the representation \u03c0\u03bb(n) occurs in the decomposition of \u03c0\u03bb(n+1) \u2193 S(n) with multiplicity one. Hence there is an infinite chain of\nembeddings\n\u03c0\u03bb(1) \u0592\u2192 \u03c0\u03bb(2) \u0592\u2192 . . .\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhich are defined uniquely up to scalar multiples. So we may set\n\u03a0(\u03c4 ) = lim ind \u03c0\u03bb(n) ,\n\nn \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(2.13)\n\nOne can show that any \u03a0(\u03c4 ) is irreducible (cf. [26, Theorem 2.1] and [27, \u00a72.7]), and\nthat \u03a0(\u03c4 ) and \u03a0(\u03c4 \u2032 ) are isomorphic if and only if \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 are equivalent.\nThis construction provides a large class of pairwise non-equivalent irreducible\nrepresentations of the group S(\u221e). We will be only interested in some special representations of this class. Let \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbl ) be an arbitrary diagram. Consider an\ninfinite tableau \u03c4 = (\u03bb(i) ) such that\n\u03bb(i) = (i \u2212 |\u03bb|, \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbl ) for i \u2265 |\u03bb| + \u03bb1 ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nand set \u03a0\u03bb = \u03a0(\u03c4 ). The representation \u03a0\u03bb is well defined since the equivalence class\nof \u03a0\u03bb does not depend on the choice of \u03bb(i) for small values of i.\nProposition 2.5 The representations T\u03bb and \u03a0\u03bb are isomorphic for any \u03bb.\nProof. For any l \u2265 n + \u03bb1 , the natural representation of S(l) in the space Hl (T\u03bb ) is\nisomorphic to the induced representation\nS(l)\n\nIndS(n)\u00d7S(l\u2212n) (\u03c0\u03bb \u2297 1)\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere S(l \u2212 n) is identified with Sn (l), and 1 stands for the trivial representation of\nS(l \u2212 n). This follows immediately from (2.9). It is well known [8] that the representation (2.15) is multiplicity free and that its spectrum consists of the representations\n\u03c0\u03bc such that \u03bc \u22a2 l and\n\u03bci+1 \u2264 \u03bbi \u2264 \u03bci ,\n\ni \u2265 1.\n\n(2.16)\n\nIt follows from (2.16) that \u03c0\u03bb(l) occurs in the decomposition of (2.15). Let Hl0 (T\u03bb )\n0\ndenote the corresponding subspace of Hl (T\u03bb ). It remains to prove that Hm\n(T\u03bb ) is\n7\n\n\fcontained in Hl0 (T\u03bb ) for any m < l provided that m is large enough. This follows\nfrom the fact that\n\u03c0\u03bb(m) \u2282 \u03c0\u03bb(l) |S(m) ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nand \u03c0\u03bb(m) 6\u2282 \u03c0\u03bc |S(m) if \u03bc satisfies (2.16) and \u03bc 6= \u03bb(l) . Indeed, property (2.17) follows\nfrom the definition of the diagrams \u03bb(l) for large l and the branching rule. Finally,\nnote that there exists i such that \u03bbi > \u03bci+1 (otherwise \u03bc = \u03bb(l) ). Applying the\nbranching rule again we complete the proof.\n\n2.2\n\nThe semigroup method\n\nDefinition 2.6 Let X be a set.\n(i) A partial bijection of X is a bijection \u03b3 : D \u2192 R between two (possibly empty)\nsubsets of X. The subset D \u2286 X is called the domain of \u03b3 and denoted by dom \u03b3.\nThe subset R \u2286 X is called the range of \u03b3 and denoted by range \u03b3. If x \u2208 X belongs\nto dom \u03b3, then we will say that \u03b3 is defined on x. The set of partial bijections of X\nis denoted by \u0393(X).\n(ii) Given \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X), we define \u03b3 \u2217 \u2208 \u0393(X) as the inverse bijection \u03b3 \u22121 : range \u03b3 \u2192\ndom \u03b3, so that dom \u03b3 \u2217 = range \u03b3 and range \u03b3 \u2217 = dom \u03b3. The mapping \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 is\ninvolutive: (\u03b3 \u2217 )\u2217 = \u03b3.\n(iii) Given \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u0393(X) with dom \u03b3i = Di and range \u03b3i = Ri , i = 1, 2, their\nproduct \u03b31 \u03b32 is a partial bijection on X with D = dom \u03b31 \u03b32 = \u03b32\u22121 (D1 \u2229 R2 ) and\nR = range \u03b31 \u03b32 = \u03b31 (D1 \u2229 R2 ):\n\u03b31 \u03b32 = (\u03b31\n\n\u03b32 (D)\n\n) \u25e6 (\u03b32\n\nD\n\n).\n\n(2.18)\n\nThat is, \u03b31 \u03b32 is defined on x \u2208 X if and only if \u03b32 is defined on x and \u03b31 is defined\non \u03b32 (x); then (\u03b31 \u03b32 )(x) = \u03b31 (\u03b32 (x)).\nAny \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X) may be regarded as a relation on X. The product defined above\nis the product of relations; see [3]. With this product \u0393(X) becomes a semigroup,\ncalled the semigroup of partial bijections of X.\nThe involution \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 is an anti-homomorphism of \u0393(X), so that \u0393(X) is an\ninvolutive semigroup.\nThe semigroup \u0393(X) possesses the unity 1, which is the identity bijection X \u2192 X,\nand the zero 0, which is the (unique) bijection of the empty subset of X onto itself.\nNote that\n1 \u03b3 = \u03b3 1 = \u03b3,\n\n0 \u03b3 = \u03b3 0 = 0,\n8\n\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X).\n\n(2.19)\n\n\fFor any subset Y \u2286 X, let 1Y \u2208 \u0393(X) denote the identity bijection Y \u2192 Y . In\nparticular, 1X = 1 and 1\u2205 = 0. Then 1Y is a self-adjoint idempotent, i.e.,\n(1Y )\u2217 = 1Y ,\n\n(1Y )2 = 1Y .\n\n(2.20)\n\nMoreover, all idempotents of this type are pairwise commuting. For any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X)\nwe obviously have\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 = 1dom \u03b3 ,\n\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2217 = 1range \u03b3 .\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe subset of those \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X) for which dom \u03b3 = range \u03b3 = X is clearly identified\nwith the group S(X) of all permutations of the set X.\nRemark. The semigroup \u0393(X) is a model example of an inverse semigroup (each of\nits elements has an inverse); see [3]. The class of inverse semigroups is very closed\nto that of groups, and the role of the semigroups of partial bijections \u0393(X) is quite\nsimilar to that of the symmetric groups S(X). In particular, any inverse semigroup is\nisomorphic to an involutive subsemigroup of some \u0393(X): this is an analog of Cayley\ntheorem; see [3].\nThere is a convenient realization of partial bijections by (0,1)-matrices, i.e., by\nthe matrices whose entries are 0 or 1. A (0,1)-matrix is said to be monomial if any\nof its rows or columns contains at most one 1. Given a set X, we will consider\n(0,1)-matrices whose rows and columns are labeled by the points of X. Then to any\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X), we assign a monomial (0,1)-matrix [\u03b3xy ] as follows: for x, y \u2208 X\n(\n1\nif y \u2208 dom \u03b3 and \u03b3(y) = x,\n\u03b3xy =\n(2.22)\n0\notherwise.\nIn particular, the unity 1 \u2208 \u0393(X) and the zero 0 \u2208 \u0393(X) are represented by the\nunit and the zero matrices, respectively. We thus obtain an isomorphism between\nthe semigroup \u0393(X) and the semigroup of monomial matrices over X with the usual\nmatrix multiplication. Note that in this matrix realization, the involution \u03b3 7\u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 is\nrepresented by the matrix transposition.\nDefinition 2.7 For Y \u2286 X we define three mappings as follows:\n(i) The canonical projection \u03b8 : \u0393(X) \u2192 \u0393(Y ). Let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(X). Then \u03b8(\u03b3) is\ndefined at y \u2208 Y if \u03b3 is defined at y and \u03b3(y) \u2208 Y . The image of y with respect\nto \u03b8(\u03b3) is \u03b3(y). In matrix terms: the matrix of \u03b8(\u03b3) is obtained from that of \u03b3 by\nstriking the rows and columns corresponding to points of X \\ Y .\n9\n\n\f(ii) The canonical embedding \u03c6 : \u0393(Y ) \u0592\u2192 \u0393(X). Let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(Y ). Then \u03c6(\u03b3) is\ndefined at x \u2208 X if and only if x \u2208 dom \u03b3 \u2286 Y or x \u2208 X \\ Y . In the former case \u03c6(\u03b3)\nsends x to \u03b3(x), and in the latter case it fixes x. In matrix terms, for x, y \u2208 X,\n(\n\u03b3xy\nif x, y \u2208 Y ,\n\u03c6(\u03b3)xy =\n(2.23)\n\u03b4xy\notherwise.\n(iii) The 0-embedding \u03c8 : \u0393(Y ) \u0592\u2192 \u0393(X).\nby regarding dom \u03b3 and range \u03b3 as subsets of\n(\n\u03b3xy\n\u03c8(\u03b3)xy =\n0\n\nLet \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(Y ). Then \u03c8(\u03b3) is obtained\nX. In matrix terms, for x, y \u2208 X,\nif x, y \u2208 Y ,\notherwise.\n\n(2.24)\n\nFor a positive integer n we shall denote by \u0393(n) the semigroup \u0393(Nn ). Given a\ntame representation T of S(\u221e) we now construct a representation Tn of the semigroup\n\u0393(n). Regarding S(\u221e) as the group of infinite monomial matrices which have only\na finite number of 1's off the diagonal, define the map \u03b8(n) : S(\u221e) \u2192 \u0393(n) which\nassigns to each infinite matrix its upper left n \u00d7 n submatrix. It is easy to check that\nthe map \u03b8(n) is surjective and it induces a bijection between the set of double cosets\nSn (\u221e)\\S(\u221e)/Sn(\u221e) and \u0393(n); see [28].\nLet T be a tame representation of S(\u221e). Denote by Pn the orthogonal projection\nPn : H(T ) \u2192 Hn (T ). Suppose that n is so large that Hn (T ) 6= {0}. For any\n\u03c31 , \u03c32 \u2208 S(\u221e) we have\n\u03b8(n) (\u03c31 ) = \u03b8(n) (\u03c32 )\n\n\u21d2\n\nPn T (\u03c31 )Pn = Pn T (\u03c32 )Pn .\n\nTherefore there exists a unique map Tn : \u0393(n) \u2192 End Hn (T ) such that\n\u0001\nTn \u03b8(n) (\u03c3) = Pn T (\u03c3)|Hn (T ) ,\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(\u221e).\n\n(2.25)\n\n(2.26)\n\nProposition 2.8 The map Tn = Tn (T ) defined by (2.26) is a representation of the\nsemigroup \u0393(n) in Hn (T ).\nProof. We give a sketch of the proof. The details and one more proof can be found\nin [28]. We show first that the tame representation T of S(\u221e) can be extended to a\nrepresentation T of the semigroup \u0393(\u221e) of partial bijections of the set N.\nFurther, we prove that Pn coincides with the operator T (1n ) where 1n is the\nidentity bijection of the subset Nn .\n10\n\n\fFinally, consider the 0-embedding \u03c8 : \u0393(n) \u2192 \u0393(\u221e); see (2.24). We have for any\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nTn (\u03b3) = Pn T \u03c8(\u03b3) Pn = T (1n )T \u03c8(\u03b3) T (1n ) = T (1n \u03c8(\u03b3)1n ) = T (\u03c8(\u03b3)). (2.27)\nThis proves the multiplicativity of Tn .\n\nConsider the tame representations T\u03bb of S(\u221e) constructed in the previous section. Proposition 2.8 yields a representation Tn (\u03bb) := Tn (T\u03bb ) of \u0393(n) provided that\nHn (T\u03bb ) 6= 0, i.e., n \u2265 |\u03bb|.\nWe now outline the proof of the classification theorem for representations of \u0393(n);\nsee [28].\nTheorem 2.9 The representations Tn (\u03bb) where \u03bb is a partition with |\u03bb| \u2264 n exhaust\nall irreducible representations of \u0393(n).\nProof. Let T be a representation of \u0393(n). Then for any m \u2264 n the operator T (1m ) is\na projection. Denote its image by Hm (T ). We let m(T ) denote the minimum value\nof m such that Hm (T ) 6= {0}.\nFurther, if T is irreducible then one shows that dim T < \u221e. If m = m(T ) then the\nsubspace Hm (T ) is invariant under S(m) and irreducible. So, Hm (T ) corresponds\nto a partition \u03bb with |\u03bb| = m. A standard argument proves that T is uniquely\ndetermined by \u03bb.\nConversely, given a partition \u03bb with |\u03bb| = m \u2264 n one uses the following argument\nto construct an irreducible representation T of \u0393(n) such that m = m(T ) and the\nrepresentation of S(m) in Hm (T ) corresponds to \u03bb.\nDenote by \u03a9(m, n) the set of injective maps \u03c9 : Nm \u2192 Nn . We define H(T ) to\nbe the space of functions f : \u03a9(m, n) \u2192 H(\u03c0\u03bb ) such that\nf (t * \u03c9) = \u03c0\u03bb (t)f (\u03c9),\n\nt \u2208 S(m),\n\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(m, n);\n\nsee (2.3). The action of \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) is given by\n(\nf (\u03b3 \u2217 \u03c9)\nif \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9m ) \u2286 dom \u03b3 \u2217 ,\n(T (\u03b3)f )(\u03c9) =\n0\notherwise.\n\n(2.28)\n\n(2.29)\n\nOne easily checks that T is a representation of \u0393(n). Moreover, it is isomorphic to\nthe representation Tn (\u03bb).\nNote that the representation of \u0393(n) corresponding to m = 0 and the empty\ndiagram is the trivial representation sending all elements of \u0393(n) to 1.\nTheorem 2.9 leads to the following result.\n11\n\n\fTheorem 2.10 Let \u03bb range over the set of all Young diagrams including the empty\ndiagram. The representations T\u03bb constructed in Section 2.1 exaust, within equivalence, all the irreducible tame representations of the group S(\u221e). Moreover, any\ntame representation of S(\u221e) can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible tame\nrepresentations.\nProof. See Theorem 6.7 and \u00a77.2 in [28].\nThis is equivalent to Lieberman's theorem [11] concerning continuous unitary\nrepresentations of the complete infinite symmetric group (this group consists of all\npermutations of the set N); see [28, \u00a77].\n\n3\n\nCentralizer construction\n\nWe shall denote by \u03b8n the canonical projection \u0393(n) \u2192 \u0393(n \u2212 1); see Definition 2.7.\nSo, if \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) then \u03b8n (\u03b3) is the upper left corner of \u03b3 of order n \u2212 1. Here the\nelements of \u0393(n) and \u0393(n \u2212 1) are regarded as (0, 1)-matrices of order n and n \u2212 1,\nrespectively.\nWe set A(n) = C[\u0393(n)], the semigroup algebra of \u0393(n). The canonical embedding\n\u0393(n\u22121) \u0592\u2192 \u0393(n) is extended to an embedding A(n\u22121) \u0592\u2192 A(n) by linearity. Further,\nS\nset A(\u221e) = C[\u0393(\u221e)] = n\u22651 A(n), the semigroup algebra of \u0393(\u221e).\nFor each i = 1, . . . , n denote by \u03b5i the diagonal n \u00d7 n-matrix whose ii-th entry is\n0 and all other diagonal entries are equal to 1. The corresponding element of \u0393(n) is\nthe identity bijection of the set Nn \\ {i}. The algebra A(n) is obviously generated by\nS(n) and the elements \u03b5i , i = 1, . . . , n. We have for any i and any \u03c3 \u2208 S(n):\n\u03c3 \u03b5i \u03c3 \u22121 = \u03b5\u03c3(i) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nProposition 3.1 The algebra A(n) is isomorphic to the abstract algebra with generators s1 , . . . , sn\u22121 , \u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5n and the defining relations\ns2k = 1,\n\u03b52k\n\n= \u03b5k ,\n\nsk \u03b5k = \u03b5k+1 sk ,\n\nsk sk+1 sk = sk+1 sk sk+1 ,\n\u03b5k \u03b5l = \u03b5l \u03b5k ,\n\nsk sl = sl sk ,\n\n|k \u2212 l| > 1, (3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nsk \u03b5k \u03b5k+1 = \u03b5k \u03b5k+1 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nProof. Denote the abstract algebra by A(n). The assignments sk 7\u2192 (k, k + 1) and\n\u03b5k 7\u2192 \u03b5k obviously define an algebra epimorphism A(n) \u2192 A(n). Note also that (3.2)\n\n12\n\n\fare defining relations for the symmetric group S(n) and (3.1) holds. To complete the\nproof we verify that dim A(n) \u2264 dim A(n). We have\ndim A(n) = | \u0393(n)| =\n\nn \u0012 \u00132\nX\nn\nr=0\n\nr\n\nr! .\n\n(3.5)\n\nOn the other hand, we see from the relations (3.3) and (3.4) that\nA(n) = C[S(n)] C[\u03b51, . . . , \u03b5n ].\n\n(3.6)\n\nHere C[\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5n ] is the subalgebra of A(n) generated by the \u03b5k . It is spanned by\nthe monomials \u03b5k1 * * * \u03b5kr with k1 < * * * < kr . Given such a monomial, consider the\nsubspace C[S(n)] \u03b5k1 * * * \u03b5kr in A(n). Using (3.1) if necessary, we may assume without\nloss of generality that ki = i for each i. Observe that by (3.4) we have in A(n)\n\u03c3 S(r) \u03b51 * * * \u03b5r = \u03c3 \u03b51 * * * \u03b5r ,\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(n).\n\n(3.7)\n\nHence the dimension of the subspace C[S(n)] \u03b51 * * * \u03b5r does not exceed the number of\nleft cosets of S(n) over the subgroup S(r). Therefore, dim A(n) does not exceed\nn \u0012 \u0013\nX\nn n!\nr=0\n\n(3.8)\n\nr r!\n\nwhich coincides with (3.5).\nUsing Proposition 3.1 we shall sometimes identify A(n) with the algebra A(n).\nCorollary 3.2 The mapping\n(k, k + 1) 7\u2192 (k, k + 1),\n\n\u03b5k 7\u2192 0\n\n(3.9)\n\ndefines an algebra homomorphism A(n) \u2192 C[S(n)] which is identical on the subalgebra C[S(n)].\n\nWe shall call (3.9) the retraction homomorphism. It can be equivalently defined\nas follows. For any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n), define its rank , denoted by rank \u03b3, as the number of\n1's in the (0, 1)-matrix representing \u03b3. That is,\nrank \u03b3 = | dom \u03b3| = | range \u03b3|.\n\n13\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fP\nThe rank of an element a =\na\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2208 A(n) is defined as the maximum of the ranks\nrank \u03b3 with a\u03b3 6= 0. Now (3.9) can also be defined by setting for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n)\n(\n\u03b3\nif rank \u03b3 = n,\n\u03b3\u2192\n(3.11)\n0\nif rank \u03b3 < n,\nand extending this to A(n) by linearity.\nFor any 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n denote by \u0393m (n) the subsemigroup of \u0393(n) which consists of\nthe matrices with first m diagonal entries equal to 1. Set Am (n) = A(n)\u0393m (n) , the\ncentralizer of \u0393m (n) in the algebra A(n). In particular, A0 (n) is the center of A(n).\nWe extend \u03b8n to a linear map A(n) \u2192 A(n \u2212 1).\nProposition 3.3 The restriction of \u03b8n to An\u22121 (n) \u2286 A(n) defines a unital algebra\nhomomorphism\n\u03b8n : An\u22121 (n) \u2192 A(n \u2212 1).\n\n(3.12)\n\nMoreover,\n\u03b8n (Am (n)) \u2286 Am (n \u2212 1)\n\nfor m = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n\n(3.13)\n\nProof. Note that any a \u2208 An\u22121 (n) commutes with \u03b5n because \u03b5n is contained in\n\u0393n\u22121 (n), and An\u22121 (n) is the centralizer of \u0393n\u22121 (n) in A(n). Since \u03b5n is an idempotent\nwe have\na \u2208 An\u22121 (n).\n\n(3.14)\n\n\u03b8n (ab) = \u03b5n ab \u03b5n = \u03b5n a \u03b5n \u03b5n b \u03b5n = \u03b8n (a)\u03b8n (b).\n\n(3.15)\n\n\u03b8n (a) = a \u03b5n = \u03b5n a = \u03b5n a \u03b5n ,\nNow, if a, b \u2208 An\u22121 (n) then\n\nIt is clear that (3.12) preserves the unity.\nFinally, we need to show that if a \u2208 Am (n) and b \u2208 \u0393m (n \u2212 1) then \u03b8n (a) and b\ncommute. Regard b as an element of \u0393(n); then it lies in \u0393m (n) and commutes with\n\u03b5n . This implies that a \u03b5n and b commute, and so do \u03b8n (a) and b.\nFor \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n), set\nJ(\u03b3) = {i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b3ii = 0},\ndeg \u03b3 = | J(\u03b3)|.\n\n14\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fProposition 3.4 Let \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 \u0393(n). Then\ndeg \u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 \u2264 deg \u03b3 + deg \u03b3 \u2032 .\n\n(3.17)\n\nMoreover, the equality in (3.17) implies \u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2032 \u03b3.\nProof. Regard \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 as partial bijections of the set Nn = {1, . . . , n}. If \u03b4 \u2208 \u0393(n)\nthen Nn \\ J(\u03b4) is the set of \u03b4-invariant elements in the domain of \u03b4. This implies\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nNn \\ J(\u03b3) \u2229 Nn \\ J(\u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2286 Nn \\ J(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 ) .\nJ(\u03b3) \u222a J(\u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2287 J(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 ),\n\n(3.18)\n\n(3.19)\n\nand (3.17) follows. Finally, the equality in (3.17) implies that J(\u03b3) and J(\u03b3 \u2032 ) are\ndisjoint. But then \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 must commute.\nUsing (3.16), we define a filtration of the space A(n):\nC = A0 (n) \u2286 A1 (n) \u2286 . . . \u2286 An (n) = A(n)\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere AM (n) is spanned by the subset {\u03b3 | deg \u03b3 \u2264 M} \u2286 \u0393(n). By Proposition 3.4\nthis filtration is compatible with the algebra structure of A(n), and the corresponding\ngraded algebra\nM\n\u0001\nAM (n)/AM \u22121 (n)\n(3.21)\ngr A(n) =\nM\n\nis commutative. Note that for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) the degree deg \u03b8n (\u03b3) can be equal either to\ndeg \u03b3 or deg \u03b3 \u2212 1. Therefore the homomorphisms (3.13) are compatible with the\nfiltration on A(n).\nDefinition 3.5 For m = 0, 1, 2, . . . let Am be the projective limit of the infinite\nsequence\n\u03b8m+1\n\n\u03b8\n\nn\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Am (n) \u2212\u2192\nAm (n \u2212 1) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Am (m + 1) \u2212\u2192 Am (m)\n\ntaken in the category of filtered algebras.\n\n15\n\n(3.22)\n\n\fBy the definition, an element a \u2208 Am is a sequence (an | n \u2265 m) such that\nan \u2208 Am (n),\n\n\u03b8n (an ) = an\u22121 ,\n\ndeg a := sup deg an < \u221e\n\n(3.23)\n\nn\u2265m\n\nwith the componentwise operations. For n \u2265 m we shall denote by \u03b8(n) the projection\nAm \u2192 Am (n) such that\n\u03b8(n) (a) = an .\n\n(3.24)\n\nThe M-th term of the filtered algebra Am will be denoted by AM\nm.\nThere are natural algebra homomorphisms Am \u2192 Am+1 defined by\n(an | n \u2265 m) 7\u2192 (an | n \u2265 m + 1)\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere we use the inclusions Am (n) \u2282 Am+1 (n) for n > m. These homomorphisms\nare injective because am is uniquely determined by am+1 .\nDefinition 3.6 The algebra A is defined as the inductive limit (the union) of the\nalgebras Am taken with respect to the embeddings Am \u0592\u2192 Am+1 , m \u2265 0, defined in\n(3.25).\n\nSince these embeddings preserve the filtration, A is a filtered algebra. We will\ndenote by AM the M-th term of the filtration, so that\n[\nAM =\nAM\n(3.26)\nm.\nm\u22650\n\nProposition 3.7 There exists a natural embedding A(\u221e) \u0592\u2192 A whose image consists\nof stable sequences a = (an ) \u2208 A.\nProof. Let b \u2208 A(\u221e). There exists m such that b \u2208 A(m). Note that b \u2208 Am (n) for\nany n \u2265 m since A(m) and \u0393m (n) commute. Set\na = (an | n \u2265 m) \u2208 Am \u2282 A with an \u2261 b.\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe sequence a \u2208 A only depends on b and not on the choice of m. The mapping\nb 7\u2192 a is clearly an algebra embedding.\n\nCorollary 3.8 There is a natural algebra embedding C[S(\u221e)] \u0592\u2192 A.\n\n16\n\n\fProposition 3.9 The center of the algebra A coincides with A0 .\nProof. Recall that A0 (n) is the center of A(n). The subalgebra A0 is contained in\nthe center of A since the sequences a = (an ) \u2208 A are multiplied componentwise.\nConversely, if a belongs to the center of A then a commutes with the subalgebra\nA(\u221e) \u2282 A. This implies that for any n the element an is contained in A0 (n), and so\na \u2208 A0 .\nRemark. The same argument shows that the subalgebra Am \u2282 A coincides with the\ncentralizer in A of the subalgebra\n[\nC[\u0393m (n)] \u2282 A(\u221e) \u2282 A.\n(3.28)\nn\u2265m\n\nNote that the centers of both algebras C[S(\u221e)] and A(\u221e) are trivial. However,\nas it will be shown in the next section, the center A0 of the algebra A has a rich\nstructure.\nProposition 3.10 For any tame representation T of the group S(\u221e), the subspace\nH\u221e (T ) \u2286 H(T ) admits a natural structure of an A-module such that for any m the\nsubspace Hm (T ) is invariant with respect to the subalgebra Am (and hence Hn (T ) is\ninvariant with respect to Am for n \u2265 m).\nProof. Let a \u2208 A and h \u2208 H\u221e (T ). Choose m such that a \u2208 Am . Then we may write\na = (an | n \u2265 m). Let us prove that\nan h = an+1 h,\n\nn \u2265 m.\n\n(3.29)\n\nConsider the family of representations {Tn } associated with T , which has been introduced in Section 2.2. Each Tn is a representation of the semigroup \u0393(n) in the\nspace Hn (T ) and so it can be extended to a representation of the semigroup algebra\nA(n) in the same space. Recall that Tn+1 (\u03b5n+1 ) projects Hn+1 (T ) onto its subspace\nHn (T ). Since h is already contained in Hn (T ) (as we assume n \u2265 m), we have\nTn+1 (\u03b5n+1 )h = h, so that\nTn+1 (1 \u2212 \u03b5n+1 )h = 0.\n\n(3.30)\n\nThis implies that h is annihilated by the left ideal I(n + 1) \u2282 A(n + 1). Since\nan \u2212 an+1 \u2208 I(n + 1), this implies (3.29).\n17\n\n\fDefine a mapping\nA \u00d7 H\u221e (T ) \u2192 H\u221e (T ),\n\n(a, h) 7\u2192 am h\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere m is so large that a \u2208 Am and h \u2208 Hm (T ). Note that under this assumption\nah \u2208 Hm (T ).\nThe mapping (3.31) is clearly bilinear and 1 h = h. The multiplicativity property\n(ab)h = a(bh) follows from the definition of the multiplication in Am .\n\nProposition 3.11 If T is an irreducible tame representation of S(\u221e) then H\u221e (T ) is\nirreducible as an A-module. In particular, the center A0 of A acts by scalar operators.\nProof. The first claim is obvious because H\u221e (T ) is already irreducible as a A(\u221e)module (see Proposition 3.7). To prove the second claim consider an element a \u2208 A0\nas an operator in H\u221e (T ). It suffices to show that a has an eigenvalue. The result\nwill then follow by a standard argument using Schur's lemma.\nAssume that a has no eigenvalues. Let us show first that a is algebraically independent over C. Indeed, let P (x) \u2208 C[x] be a nonzero polynomial of a minimum\ndegree such that P (a) = 0. Then P (x) = (x\u2212\u03b1) Q(x) for a certain \u03b1 \u2208 C and a polynomial Q(x) \u2208 C[x]. Since Q(a) is a nonzero operator, there is a vector v \u2208 H\u221e (T )\nsuch that w := Q(a)v 6= 0. Then w is an eigenvector for a with the eigenvalue \u03b1.\nContradiction.\nWe note now that the space H\u221e (T ) has countable dimension and then use a\nversion of Dixmier's argument [4] as follows.\nSince a is algebraically independent over C, the field C(a) is embedded in the\nendomorphism algebra of H\u221e (T ). This implies that the dimension of H\u221e (T ) is at\nleast as large as the dimension of C(a) over C, but the latter is continuum. This\ncontradiction completes the proof.\n\n4\n\nThe structure of the algebra A0\n\nIn the last two sections we aim to describe the structure of the algebras Am . Here we\nconsider the commutative algebra A0 ; see Proposition 3.9. We construct generators\nof A0 and show that it is isomorphic to the algebra of shifted symmetric functions.\n\n18\n\n\f4.1\n\nGenerators of A0\n\nLet Z(S(n)) denote the center of the algebra C[S(n)]. For 0 \u2264 M \u2264 n denote by\nZ M (S(n)) the M-th term of the filtration on Z(S(n)) inherited from the algebra\nA(n); see (3.20). Note that\nZ 0 (S(n)) = Z 1 (S(n)) = C 1\n\n(4.1)\n\nbecause, for a permutation s \u2208 S(n) the inequality deg s \u2264 1 implies s = 1.\nFor any partition M = (M1 , . . . , Mr ) with\n|M| = M1 + . . . + Mr \u2264 n\n\n(4.2)\n\nintroduce the element cM\nn of the group algebra C[S(n)] as follows\nX\ncM\n(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) * * * (k1 , . . . , kMr )\nn =\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the sequences i1 , . . . , iM1 ; j1 , . . . , jM2 ; . . . ; k1 , . . . , kMr\nof |M| pairwise distinct indices taken from Nn . By (i1 , . . . , iM1 ) etc. in (4.3) we\ndenote cycles in the symmetric group. For the empty partition \u2205 we set c\u2205n = 1. Note\nP\n(1)\nthat cn = ni=1 (i) = n 1. Given two partitions M and L we denote by M \u222a L the\npartition whose parts are those of M and L rewritten in the decreasing order. We\nhave\ncnM\u222a1\u222a...\u222a1 = (n \u2212 |M|) * * * (n \u2212 |M| \u2212 p + 1) cM\nn\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere p stands for the number of 1's in the left hand side of the relation.\nBy definition (3.16) of the degree of an element of \u0393(n) we have\ndeg c(1)\nn = 0,\n\nand\n\n)\ndeg c(M\n=M\nn\n\nfor M \u2265 2.\n\n(4.5)\n\nMore generally,\n1 ,... ,Mr )\ndeg c(M\n=\nn\n\nX\n\nMi .\n\n(4.6)\n\ni, Mi \u22652\n\nProposition 4.1 Each of the families\ncM\nn ,\n\n|M| = n,\n\n(4.7)\n\n|M| \u2264 n and M has no part equal to 1,\n\n(4.8)\n\nand\ncM\nn ,\n\nforms a basis of Z(S(n)). Moreover, the elements of degree \u2264 M of each family form\na basis of Z M (S(n)).\n19\n\n\fProof. The elements (4.7) are proportional to the characteristic functions of the\nconjugacy classes of the group S(n) and so, they form a basis of Z(S(n)). By (4.4)\nthe elements of type (4.8) are proportional to those of type (4.7).\n\nProposition 4.2 For any two partitions M = (M1 , . . . , Mr ) and L = (L1 , . . . , Lt )\nwith |M| + |L| \u2264 n we have\nL\nM\u222aL\ncM\n+ (. . . ),\nn cn = cn\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere (. . . ) stands for a linear combination of the elements cK\nn with |K| < |M| + |L|.\nProof. For a permutation s \u2208 S(n) or s \u2208 S(\u221e) define its support as\nsupp s = {i \u2208 Nn | s(i) 6= i} or supp s = {i \u2208 N | s(i) 6= i},\n\n(4.10)\n\nrespectively. (The degree of a permutation is then given by deg s = | supp s|; cf.\n(3.16)).\nLet s \u2208 S(n) be a permutation which occurs in the expansion of cM\nn , that is,\ns is of cycle type M \u222a 1 \u222a . . . \u222a 1 (with n \u2212 |M| units). Similarly, let s\u2032 be a\npermutation occurring in cLn . If the supports supp s and supp s\u2032 are disjoint then s\nand s\u2032 commute, and the product ss\u2032 occurs in the expansion of cM\u222aL\n. In particular,\nn\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndeg ss = |M| + |L|. If supp s and supp s have a non-empty intersection then the\ndegree of ss\u2032 is strictly less than |M| + |L|.\nRemark. A detailed investigation of the structure constants for the products of type\n(4.9) have been recently given by Ivanov and Kerov [7].\n\nCorollary 4.3 Let k = (k1 , . . . , kn ) run over the n-tuples of non-negative integers\nsuch that 2k2 + * * * + nkn \u2264 n. Then the monomials\nk2\n(n) kn\n(c(2)\nn ) * * * (cn )\n\n(4.11)\n\nform a basis of Z(S(n)). Moreover, for any M \u2265 0, the elements (4.11) with 2k2 +\n* * * + nkn \u2264 M form a basis of Z M (S(n)).\nProof. It suffices to prove that\nk2\n(n) kn\n(c(2)\n= cM\nn ) * * * (cn )\nn + (. . . )\n\n20\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fwhere M = 2k2 * * * nkn and (. . . ) stands for a certain linear combination of the ele\u2032\n\u2032\nments cM\nn with |M | < |M| = 2k2 + * * * + nkn . But this follows from Proposition 4.2.\n\nNow we will define analogs of the elements cM\nn for the algebra A0 (n). Namely, for\nany partition M = (M1 , . . . , Mr ) with |M| \u2264 n set\nX\n\u2206M\n=\n(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) * * * (k1 , . . . , kMr )(1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr ) (4.13)\nn\n\nwhere, as in (4.3), the sum is taken over all sequences of |M| pairwise distinct indices\ntaken from Nn . In particular,\n\u2206(1)\nn\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5i ).\n\n(4.14)\n\ni=1\n\nFor the empty partition \u2205 we set \u2206\u2205n = 1. By (3.16), we have\ndeg \u2206M\nn = |M|\n\nfor any partition M,\n\n(4.15)\n\ncf. (4.6). Note that \u2206M\nn can also be written as\nX\n\u2206M\n=\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr )(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) * * * (k1 , . . . , kMr ), (4.16)\nn\nand as\n\n\u2206M\nn =\n\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr )(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 )\n* * * (k1 , . . . , kMr )(1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr ).\n\n(4.17)\n\nIndeed, (1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr ) is invariant under the conjugation by the permutation\n(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) * * * (k1 , . . . , kMr ) which implies (4.16). To derive (4.17) it\nsuffices to note that (1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kr ) is an idempotent.\nProposition 4.4 The element \u2206M\nn belongs to A0 (n) for any M.\nProof. Since \u0393(n) is generated by the group S(n) and the pairwise commuting idempotents \u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5n , it suffices to show that \u2206M\nn commutes both with S(n) and with\nM\nthe \u03b5i . The first claim is clear since \u2206n is invariant under the conjugation by the\nelements of S(n). To prove the second claim, we observe that any \u03b5l , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n,\ncommutes with any term\n\u03c3 = (i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) * * * (k1 , . . . , kMr )(1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5kMr )\n21\n\n(4.18)\n\n\fin (4.13). Indeed, this is clear if l does not occur in the set of indices in (4.18)\nbecause \u03b5l commutes with the corresponding cycle. But if l coincides with one of the\nindices i1 , . . . , kMr , then \u03b5l \u03c3 = \u03c3 \u03b5l = 0. This follows from (4.17) and the relation\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5l )\u03b5l = 0.\n\nProposition 4.5 We have\nM\n\u03b8n (\u2206M\nn ) = \u2206n\u22121\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere we adopt the convention that\n\u2206M\nk = 0 if\n\n|M| > k.\n\n(4.20)\n\nProof. By the definition of the projection \u03b8n (see Section 3) we need to calculate\n\u2206M\nn \u03b5n . However, as it follows from the proof of Proposition 4.4, the effect of multiplying \u2206M\nn by \u03b5n reduces to striking from (4.13) all terms (4.18) such that n occurs\namong the corresponding indices. If |M| = n, then all the terms are vanished, so\nthat the result of the multiplication is 0. If |M| < n, then the terms that survive are\njust the terms of the sum defining \u2206M\nn\u22121 .\n\nCorollary 4.6 For any partition M, there exists an element \u2206M \u2208 A0 such that\n\u03b8(n) (\u2206M ) = \u2206M\nn\n\nfor any n \u2265 1\n\n(4.21)\n\nwith the convention (4.20).\nProof. By Proposition 4.4, \u2206M\nn \u2208 A0 (n). Now we apply Proposition 4.5 and note\nthat the degrees of the elements \u2206M\nn are uniformly bounded by (4.15).\nWe now aim to prove an analog of Proposition 4.1 for the algebra A0 (n); see\nProposition 4.10 below. For this we need the following three lemmas.\nLet I(n) = A(n)(1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) denote the left ideal of the algebra A(n) generated by\nthe element 1 \u2212 \u03b5n .\nLemma 4.7 For any n,\nI(n) \u2229 A0 (n) = Z(S(n))(1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n22\n\n(4.22)\n\n\fProof. First suppose that x \u2208 A(n) can be written as y (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) where\ny \u2208 Z(S(n)). The argument of the proof of Proposition 4.4 shows that x \u2208 A0 (n).\nMoreover, we obviously have x \u2208 I(n).\nConversely, suppose x \u2208 I(n) \u2229 A0 (n). Then x \u03b5n = 0. Using the invariance of x\nunder the conjugation by elements of S(n) we also obtain x \u03b5i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n.\nTherefore x is invariant under the right multiplication by (1\u2212\u03b51 ) * * * (1\u2212\u03b5n ). Further,\nwe may write\nx=y+\n\nn\nX\n\nX\n\nyi1 ...ir \u03b5i1 * * * \u03b5ir ,\n\n(4.23)\n\nr=1 1\u2264i1 <***<ir \u2264n\n\nwhere y and all the yi1 ...ir are elements of C[S(n)]; see Proposition 3.1. Multiplying\nthis relation by (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) on the right we obtain\nx = y (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n(4.24)\n\nFinally, for any s \u2208 S(n) we may write\nx = sxs\u22121 = sys\u22121(1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n(4.25)\n\nAveraging over s \u2208 S(n) turns y into an element of Z(S(n)).\nFor a subset I = {i1 , . . . , ik } in Nn we put \u03b5I = \u03b5i1 * * * \u03b5ik , and for s \u2208 S(n) set\nQ(s) = {i \u2208 Nn | sii = 1} = Nn \\ supp s.\n\n(4.26)\n\nLemma 4.8 The mapping\ns 7\u2192 \u03b3,\n\n\u03b3 = s \u03b5Q(s) = \u03b5Q(s) s,\n\n(4.27)\n\ndefines a bijection of S(n) onto the set of all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) satisfying the conditions\ndom \u03b3 = range \u03b3,\ndeg \u03b3 = n.\n\n(4.28)\n(4.29)\n\nProof. The effect of the multiplication of s by \u03b5Q(s) from the left or from the right\nconsists of replacing all the 1's on the diagonal by zeros. This implies (4.28), and\n(4.29) is obvious.\nConversely, let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) satisfy (4.28) and (4.29). Relation (4.28) means that for\nany i \u2208 Nn the i-th row and the i-th column are zero or non-zero at the same time,\nwhereas (4.29) means that all the diagonal entries of \u03b3 are zero. Now, let the matrix\n23\n\n\f\u03c3 be defined as follows. Set \u03c3ii = 1 if the i-th row (and the i-th column) of \u03b3 is zero,\nand set \u03c3ij = \u03b3ij for i 6= j. It is easy to see that \u03c3 \u2208 S(n) and that \u03b3 is the image of\n\u03c3 under the mapping (4.27).\n\nLemma 4.9 The restriction of the projection \u03b8n : A0 (n) \u2192 A0 (n \u2212 1) to the subspace\nA0n\u22121 (n) is injective.\nProof. Let x \u2208 A0 (n) and \u03b8n (x) = 0. We will show that deg x = n unless x = 0. By\nLemma 4.7, x can be written as a linear combination of the elements\nX\n(\u22121)|I| s \u03b5I ,\ns \u2208 S(n).\n(4.30)\ns (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) =\nI\u2286 Nn\n\nRewrite this as\ns (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|I| s \u03b5I +\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|I| s \u03b5I .\n\n(4.31)\n\nI6\u2287Q(s)\n\nI\u2287Q(s)\n\nThen the terms of the first sum are of degree n whereas those of the second sum are\nof degree strictly less than n. So it suffices to prove that the elements\nX\n(\u22121)|I| s \u03b5I ,\ns \u2208 S(n),\n(4.32)\nI\u2287Q(s)\n\nare linearly independent. Note that\nrank s \u03b5I = n \u2212 |Q(s)|\n\nif I = Q(s),\n\n(4.33)\n\nrank s \u03b5I < n \u2212 |Q(s)|\n\nif I \u2283 Q(s);\n\n(4.34)\n\nsee (3.10). Write S(n) as the disjoint union of n + 1 subsets:\nS(n) =\n\nn\n[\n\n{s \u2208 S(n) | n \u2212 |Q(s)| = k}.\n\n(4.35)\n\nk=0\n\nIf s belongs to the k-th subset then\n\uf8eb\nrank \uf8ed\n\nX\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(\u22121)|I| s \u03b5I \uf8f8 = k.\n\nI\u2287Q(s)\n\n(4.36)\n\nMoreover, only one term of the sum in (4.36) has rank k, namely that with I = Q(s).\nFinally, it remains to note that by Lemma 4.8 all the elements s\u03b5Q(s) with s \u2208 S(n)\nare pairwise distinct elements of \u0393(n).\n\n24\n\n\fProposition 4.10 For any n the elements \u2206M\nn , where M is any partition with\n|M| \u2264 n, form a basis of A0 (n). Furthermore, for any M such that 0 \u2264 M \u2264 n\nthese elements with |M| \u2264 M form a basis of AM\n0 (n).\nProof. The first claim of the proposition will follow from the second one. We will\nprove the second claim using induction on n. The claim is obviously true for n = 1.\nAssume that n \u2265 2 and M \u2264 n \u2212 1. By the induction hypothesis the elements \u2206M\nn\u22121\nM\nwith |M| \u2264 M form a basis of AM\n(n\n\u2212\n1).\nBy\nProposition\n4.5\nthe\nimage\nof\n\u2206\n0\nn\nM\nunder \u03b8n is \u2206M\n.\nBy\nLemma\n4.9\nthe\nrestriction\n\u03b8\n\u2193\nA\n(n)\nis\ninjective.\nTherefore,\nn\nn\u22121\n0\nM\nthe elements \u2206M\nwith\n|M|\n\u2264\nM\nform\na\nbasis\nin\nA\n(n).\nn\n0\nFurther, let us show that the elements \u2206M\nwith\n|M| = n form a basis of I(n) \u2229\nn\nA0 (n). Note that\nM\n\u2206M\nn = cn (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n(4.37)\n\nBy Proposition 4.1 the elements cM\nn , where M runs over the set of partitions of n,\nform a basis of Z(S(n)). Due to Lemma 4.7 it now remains to check that the elements\ncM\nn , being multiplied by (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ), remain linearly independent. However,\nthis follows from the fact that the composite map\nC[S(n)] \u2192 A(n) \u2192 C[S(n)]\n\n(4.38)\n\nis the identity map; here the first arrow is the multiplication by (1 \u2212 \u03b51 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ),\nand the second arrow is the retraction homomorphism (3.9).\nFinally, let us show that\n\u0001\nA0 (n) = A0n\u22121 (n) \u2295 I(n) \u2229 A0 (n) .\n(4.39)\n\nIndeed, as it was shown above, \u03b8n maps A0n\u22121 (n) onto A0n\u22121 (n \u2212 1) = A0 (n \u2212 1) .\nSince I(n) \u2229 A0 (n) is the kernel of the restriction \u03b8n \u2193 A0 (n) and since \u03b8n (A0 (n)) is\ncontained in A0 (n \u2212 1), we obtain the decomposition\n\u0001\nA0 (n) = A0n\u22121 (n) + I(n) \u2229 A(n) .\n(4.40)\nLemma 4.9 implies that\n\nA0n\u22121 (n) \u2229 I(n) = {0}\n\n(4.41)\n\nand (4.39) follows.\nTo complete the proof we need to show that the elements \u2206M\nn with 0 \u2264 |M| \u2264 n\nform a basis of A0 (n). However, the elements with |M| < n form a basis of the first\ncomponent of the decomposition (4.39), whereas the elements with |M| = n form a\nbasis in the second component of this decomposition.\nThe following is an analog of Corollary 4.3.\n25\n\n\fCorollary 4.11 Let k = (k1 , . . . , kn ) run over the n-tuples of non-negative integers\nsuch that k1 + 2k2 + * * * + nkn \u2264 n. Then the monomials\n(1)\n\nkn\n(\u22061 )k1 * * * (\u2206(n)\nn )\n\n(4.42)\n\nform a basis of A0 (n). Moreover, for any M \u2265 0, the monomials (4.42) with k1 +\n2k2 + * * * + nkn \u2264 M form a basis of AM\n0 (n).\nProof. It suffices to prove that\n(1)\n\n(\u22061 )k1 * * * (\u2206n(n) )kn = \u2206M\nn + (. . . )\n\n(4.43)\n\nwhere M = 1k1 2k2 * * * nkn and (. . . ) stands for a linear combination of the elements\n\u2032\n\u2206M\nwith |M\u2032| < |M|. Then our claim will follow from Proposition 4.10. To prove\nn\n(4.43) we verify that for any partitions M = (M1 , . . . , Mr ) and L = (L1 , . . . , Lt )\nwith |M| + |L| \u2264 n\nL\nM\u222aL\n\u2206M\n+ (. . . ),\nn \u2206n = \u2206n\n\n(4.44)\n\nwhere the rest term (. . . ) has degree strictly less than |M| + |L| and so, it is a linear\ncombination of elements \u2206K\nn with |K| < |M| + |L|.

We shall denote by\nP the set of all partitions.\nTheorem 4.12 The elements \u2206M , M \u2208 P form a basis of the algebra A0 . Moreover,\nfor any M \u2265 0, the elements \u2206M with |M| \u2264 M form a basis of the M-th subspace\nAM\n0 in A0 .\n26\n\n\fProof. The first claim follows from the second one. The second claim follows from\nM\nProposition 4.10 and the definition of AM\n0 as the projective limit of the spaces A0 (n).\n\nCorollary 4.13 For n > M, the mapping\nM\n\u03b8n : AM\n0 (n) \u2192 A0 (n \u2212 1)\n\n(4.48)\n\nis an isomorphism of vector spaces and so is the mapping\nM\n\u03b8(n) : AM\n0 \u2192 A0 (n),\n\nn \u2265 M.\n\n(4.49)\n\nIn particular, dim AM\n0 < \u221e.\n\nTheorem 4.14 The monomials\n(\u2206(1) )k1 (\u2206(2) )k2 * * *\n\n(4.50)\n\nwith k1 , k2 , . . . \u2208 Z+ and k1 + 2k2 + . . . < \u221e form a basis of the algebra A0 .

However, this follows from the relation (4.43).\n\nCorollary 4.15 The elements \u2206(1) , \u2206(2) , . . . are algebraically independent and generate the algebra A0 .\n\n27\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe algebra \u039b\u2217 of shifted symmetric functions, and the\nisomorphism A0 \u2243 \u039b\u2217\n\nLet \u039b\u2217 (n) \u2286 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] denote the subalgebra of polynomials in n variables\nx1 , . . . , xn which are symmetric in the new variables\ny1 = x1 \u2212 1, y2 = x2 \u2212 2, . . . , yn = xn \u2212 n.\n\n(4.52)\n\nFollowing [24], we refer to \u039b\u2217 (n) as the algebra of shifted symmetric polynomials\nin n variables. We equip \u039b\u2217 (n) with the filtration with respect to the usual degree of\npolynomials. Set \u039b\u2217 (0) = C and for n \u2265 1 define the projection \u039b\u2217 (n) \u2192 \u039b\u2217 (n \u2212 1)\nby specializing xn = 0. Note that this projection preserves the filtration.\nDefinition 4.16 The algebra \u039b\u2217 of shifted symmetric functions is the projective limit\nof the filtered algebras \u039b\u2217 (n) as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIn other words, an element f \u2208 \u039b\u2217 is a sequence (fn | n \u2265 0) such that\n(i) fn \u2208 \u039b\u2217 (n) for any n;\n(ii) for any n \u2265 1, fn 7\u2192 fn\u22121 under the projection \u039b\u2217 (n) \u2192 \u039b\u2217 (n \u2212 1);\n(iii) deg fn remains bounded as n \u2192 \u221e.\nFor an element f = (fn ) \u2208 \u039b\u2217 , we define its degree by\ndeg f = sup deg fn ,\n\n(4.53)\n\nn\n\nand for M = 0, 1, . . . we denote by (\u039b\u2217 )M the subspace in \u039b\u2217 consisting of the\nelements of degree \u2264 M. The algebra \u039b\u2217 was first introduced in [26]. A detailed\nstudy of \u039b\u2217 is contained in [24].\nNote an evident similarity between the shifted symmetric functions and the symmetric functions. Recall (see [13]) that the algebra \u039b of symmetric functions is defined\nas the projective limit as n \u2192 \u221e of the graded algebras \u039b(n) \u2286 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] of symmetric polynomials in n variables. A difference between \u039b\u2217 and \u039b consists in a shift\nof variables and the replacement of the gradation by a filtration. The algebra \u039b\u2217 may\nbe viewed as a deformation of the algebra \u039b. Indeed, let h be a numerical parameter,\nand let \u039b\u2217h be defined similarly to \u039b\u2217 but with yi = xi \u2212 ih instead of (4.52). Then\nthe algebras \u039b\u2217h with h 6= 0, are naturally isomorphic to each other. Moreover, \u039b\u22171\ncoincides with \u039b\u2217 while \u039b\u22170 coincides with \u039b. Another relation between \u039b\u2217 and \u039b is\ngiven by\n\n28\n\n\fProposition 4.17 The graded algebra\ngr \u039b\u2217 = C \u2295\n\n\u221e \u0010\n\u0011\nM\n(\u039b\u2217 )M /(\u039b\u2217 )M \u22121\n\n(4.54)\n\nM =1\n\nis isomorphic to the algebra \u039b.\nProof. For any M \u2265 1 and any n, \u039b\u2217 (n)M /\u039b\u2217 (n)M \u22121 is naturally isomorphic to the\nM-th homogeneous component of the algebra \u039b(n) \u2286 C[x1 , . . . , xn ]. Moreover, this\nisomorphism is compatible with the projections \u039b\u2217 (n) \u2192 \u039b\u2217 (n \u2212 1) and \u039b(n) \u2192\n\u039b(n \u2212 1). This yields an isomorphism gr \u039b\u2217 \u2192 \u039b.\nIn the following example we give some families of generators of the algebra \u039b\u2217 .\nNote that there also exist other important families analogous to the basic symmetric\nfunctions; see [24].\nExample 4.18 For M = 1, 2, . . . , elements eM , hM , and pM defined by the formulas\nbelow, are shifted symmetric functions:\nE(t) = 1 +\nH(t) = 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nM =1\n\u221e\nX\n\nM\n\neM t\n\n=\n\nhM tM =\n\nM =1\n\npM =\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\n\u221e\nY\n1 + (xk \u2212 k)t\n\nk=1\n\u221e\nY\n\nk=1\n\n1 \u2212 kt\n\n,\n\n1 + kt\n,\n1 \u2212 (xk \u2212 k)t\n\n\u0001\n(xk \u2212 k)M \u2212 (\u2212k)M .\n\nThe generating functions satisfy the following relations; cf.

Furthermore, we have\n\u039b\u2217 = C[e1 , e2 , . . . ] = C[h1 , h2 , . . . ] = C[p1 , p2 , . . . ].\n\n29\n\n(4.56)\n\n\fProof. The corresponding statement for the algebra \u039b of symmetric functions is well\nknown, see [13, Ch. 1, Section 2]. Now, we apply Proposition 4.17 and note that the\nimage of the shifted symmetric function eM , hM or pM in the space (\u039b\u2217 )M /(\u039b\u2217 )M \u22121 \u2243\n\u039bM is the corresponding M-th symmetric function (elementary, complete or power\nsum). This implies that each of the three families is algebraically independent and\ngenerates the algebra \u039b\u2217 .\nLet Fun P denote the algebra of complex functions on the set of partitions P. By\nPropositions 3.10 and 3.11, there is an algebra homomorphism\nA0 \u2192 Fun P,\n\na 7\u2192 b\na,\n\n(4.57)\n\nsuch that for a \u2208 A0 and \u03bb \u2208 P, the element a acts in H\u221e (T\u03bb ) as the scalar\noperator b\na(\u03bb) * 1. On the other hand, any \u03bb \u2208 P can be viewed as a sequence\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , 0, 0, . . . ) with finitely many non-zero coordinates, and so, any element of\n\u039b\u2217 may be viewed as a function on P. Thus we obtain an algebra homomorphism\n\u039b\u2217 \u2192 Fun P which is clearly an embedding.\nLet \u03bb be a partition with m = |\u03bb| \u2264 n. Consider the corresponding irreducible\nrepresentation \u03c0\u03bb of S(m), and the representation Tn (\u03bb) of the semigroup \u0393(n); see\nSection 2.2.\n(r)\n\nProposition 4.20 The eigenvalue of the central element \u2206n in Tn (\u03bb) is 0 if r > m.\n(r)\nIf r \u2264 m then the eigenvalue coincides with that of the element cm in the representation \u03c0\u03bb of S(m).\nProof. Recall the construction of Tn (\u03bb) given in Section 2.2. Let \u03c9 be an injective\nmap from {1, . . . , m} to {1, . . . , n}. Regarding \u03c9 as an m-tuple \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9m ) we\nhave\n(\n0\nif a \u2208 \u03c9,\n\u03b5a f (\u03c9) =\n(4.58)\nf (\u03c9)\nif a \u2208\n/ \u03c9.\nTherefore, the product (1\u2212\u03b5i1 ) * * * (1\u2212\u03b5ir ) is a projection to the subspace of functions\nf such that the indices i1 , . . . , ir belong to any \u03c9 \u2208 supp f . This implies the first\nstatement. The second follows from the obvious embedding H(\u03c0\u03bb ) \u2286 H(Tn (\u03bb)) whose\nimage consists of the functions supported by the maps \u03c9 such that {\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9m } =\n{1, . . . , m}.\n(r)\n\nIt was proved in [10] (see also [24]) that the eigenvalue of cn in the irreducible\nrepresentation \u03c0\u03bb of S(n) is a shifted symmetric function whose highest homogeneous\ncomponent is the power sum symmetric function pr .\n30\n\n\fTheorem 4.21 Let \u039b\u2217 be identified with its image in Fun P. Then the mapping\n(4.57) is an isomorphism A0 \u2192 \u039b\u2217 of filtered algebras.\nProof. By Proposition 4.20 the images of the generators \u2206(r) \u2208 A0 with respect\nto the homomorphism (4.57) are shifted symmetric functions which are algebraically\nindependent generators of the algebra \u039b\u2217 . The map obviously respects the filtrations.\n\nRecall that by Propositions 3.10 and 3.11, elements of the center A0 act in irreducible tame representations of S(\u221e) by scalar operators. Hence, any such representation determines a homomorphism A0 \u2192 C.\nCorollary 4.22 The center A0 separates irreducible tame representations of S(\u221e).\nThat is, non-equivalent irreducible tame representations give rise to distinct homomorphisms A0 \u2192 C.\nProof. By Theorem 2.10, the irreducible tame representations are precisely the representations T\u03bb . Hence, our claim is equivalent to the fact that the map \u039b\u2217 \u2192 Fun P\ndefined above is an embedding.\n\n5\n\nThe structure of the algebra Am , m > 0\n\nHere we generalize the results of Section 4 to the algebra Am , where m = 1, 2, . . . .\nThroughout the section we assume 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n and use the notation\nNmn = {m + 1, . . . , n}.\n\n(5.1)\n\nFor \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n), set\nJm (\u03b3) = {i | i \u2208 Nmn , \u03b3ii = 0},\ndegm \u03b3 = | Jm (\u03b3)|.\n\n(5.2)\n\nWe shall call degm \u03b3 the m-degree of \u03b3.\nProposition 5.1 For \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 \u0393(n),\ndegm \u03b3\u03b4 \u2264 degm \u03b3 + degm \u03b4.\n\n31\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fProof. For any i \u2208 Nmn we have\n(\u03b3\u03b4)ii = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03b3ij \u03b4ji = 0\n\nfor all j = 1, . . . , n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nIn particular, (\u03b3\u03b4)ii = 0 implies \u03b3ii \u03b4ii = 0, i.e.,\nJm (\u03b3\u03b4) \u2286 Jm (\u03b3) \u222a Jm (\u03b4),\n\n(5.5)\n\nand (5.3) follows.\n\nDefinition 5.2 Using the m-degree we define a new filtration in A(n), called the\nm-filtration, by\nA(m) = Fm0 (A(n)) \u2286 Fm1 (A(n)) \u2286 . . . \u2286 Fmn\u2212m (A(n)) = A(n).\n\n(5.6)\n\nHere FmM (A(n)), the M-th term of the filtration, is formed by the elements a \u2208 A(n)\nwhich are linear combinations of the elements of \u0393(n) of m-degree \u2264 M. For any\nsubspace S of A(n) we will use the symbol FmM (S) to indicate the M-th term of the\ninduced filtration.\n\nBy Proposition 5.1, the m-filtration is compatible with the algebra structure of\nA(n), so the corresponding graded algebra exists. But contrary to the case m = 0, this\ngraded algebra is not commutative for m \u2265 1 since it contains, as the 0-component,\nthe non-commutative algebra A(m).\nLet D be a multiplicative semigroup with unity 1. Consider the union D \u222a {0},\nwhere 0 is an extra symbol, and adopt the convention that\nd 0 = 0 d = 0,\n\nd + 0 = 0 + d = d for any d \u2208 D.\n\n(5.7)\n\nDefinition 5.3 (i) The semigroup S(m, D) consists of the m \u00d7 m matrices \u03b1 = [\u03b1ij ]\nwith entries in D \u222a {0} such that any row and column contains exactly one non-zero\nentry. The product is the matrix multiplication with the conventions (5.7).\n(ii) The semigroup \u0393(n, D) is defined as in (i) by allowing any row and column\ncontain at most one non-zero entry.\n\nNote that if D = {1}, then S(n, D) and \u0393(n, D) coincide with S(n) and \u0393(n),\nrespectively. If D is a group, then S(n, D) is the wreath product of S(n) and D.\n32\n\n\fWe shall be assuming now that D is the free abelian semigroup {1, z, z 2 , . . . }\nwith unity 1 and one generator z. This semigroup is isomorphic to the additive\nsemigroup Z+ . We denote the corresponding semigroups introduced in Definition 5.3\nby S(m, Z+ ) and \u0393(m, Z+ ).\nSet ord z k = k for k = 0, 1, . . . , and for \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ), set\nX\nord \u03b1 =\nord \u03b1ij .\n(5.8)\ni,j; \u03b1ij 6=0\n\nDefinition 5.4 (i) Set\n\u0393(m, n) = {\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(n) | dom \u03c3 and range \u03c3 contain Nmn }.\n\n(5.9)\n\n(ii) Consider the linear span of \u0393(m, n) and let Zm (n) \u2282 A(n) denote the subspace\nin this span formed by the elements invariant under the conjugation by the elements\nof the group Sm (n).\n\u0001\nIn particular, \u0393(0, n) = S(n) and Z0 (n) = Z S(n) is the center of C[S(n)]. The\n\u0001\nrole of \u0393(m, n) and Zm (n) will be similar to that of S(n) and Z S(n) in Section 4.\nNote also that Zm (n) contains C[S(n)]Sm (n) , the centralizer of Sm (n) in the group\nalgebra C[S(n)].\nNow our purpose is to construct a convenient basis in Zm (n). To do this, we\nneed to classify the Sm (n)-orbits in \u0393(m, n) where the elements of Sm (n) act by\nconjugations.\nProposition 5.5 There is a natural parameterization of the Sm (n)-orbits in \u0393(m, n)\nby the couples (\u03b1, M), where \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) and M is a partition such that\nord \u03b1 + |M| = n \u2212 m.\n\n(5.10)\n\nProof. Fix an arbitrary element \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(m, n) and assign to it an m \u00d7 m-matrix\n\u03b1 = \u03b1(\u03c3) as follows. For i, j \u2208\n/ Nmn set\n\u03b1ij = 0\n\nif j \u2208\n/ dom \u03c3,\n\n(5.11)\n\n\u03b1ij = 1\n\nif j \u2208 dom \u03c3 and \u03c3(j) = i,\n\n(5.12)\n\n\u03b1ij = z k\n\nif j \u2208 dom \u03c3,\n\n(5.13)\n\nand there exist k points p1 , . . . , pk \u2208 Nmn such that \u03c3(j) = p1 , \u03c3(p1 ) = p2 , . . . ,\n\u03c3(pk\u22121 ) = pk , \u03c3(pk ) = i. Thus, to any j \u2208 dom \u03c3 with \u03c3(j) \u2208 Nmn we have assigned\n33\n\n\fa subset {p1 , . . . , pk } \u2286 Nmn . It is clear that these subsets are pairwise disjoint. Let\nP = P (\u03c3) denote their union. Then ord \u03b1 = | P | \u2264 n \u2212 m. It is also clear that\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ).\nFurther, let P \u2217 = P \u2217 (\u03c3) be the complement of P in Nmn . Then P \u2217 is contained in\nthe domain of \u03c3, and P \u2217 is \u03c3-invariant. Therefore, the restriction of \u03c3 to P \u2217 defines\na permutation of P \u2217 . Let M = M(\u03c3) be the partition of the number | P \u2217| which is\ndefined by the lengths of the cycles of this permutation. Then the couple\n(\u03b1, M) = (\u03b1(\u03c3), M(\u03c3))\n\n(5.14)\n\nsatisfies (5.10). It is clear that the couple (5.14) remains unchanged if \u03c3 is replaced\nby s\u03c3s\u22121 with s \u2208 Sm (n). Moreover, it is also clear that if the couples (5.14) corresponding to two elements of \u0393(m, n) are the same, then these elements belong to the\nsame orbit. Finally, any couple satisfying (5.10) can be obtained from an element of\n\u0393(m, n).\nRemark. A couple (5.14) corresponds to an element of S(n) \u2286 \u0393(m, n) if and only if\n\u03b1 \u2208 S(m, Z+ ).\nWe shall now define analogs of the elements cM\nn . First, for any subset Q \u2286 Nmn\nand any partition M = (M1 , . . . , Mr ) such that |M| = | Q| we set\nX\n(5.15)\ncM\n=\n(i1 , . . . , iM1 )(j1 , . . . , jM2 ) . . . (k1 , . . . , kMr ),\nQ\n\nwhere (i1 , . . . , iM1 ) etc. are cyclic permutations of the corresponding indices and the\nsummation is taken over all the orderings (i1 , . . . , iM1 ; j1 , . . . , jM2 ; . . . ; k1 , . . . , kMr )\nof the elements of Q. We shall suppose that c\u2205\u2205 = 1.\nSecond, for any \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) and any subset P \u2286 Nmn such that ord \u03b1 = | P |,\nwe set\n\u0393(\u03b1, P ) = {\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(m, n) | \u03b1(\u03c3) = \u03b1, P (\u03c3) = P, M(\u03c3) = (1n\u2212m\u2212| P | )},\n\n(5.16)\n\ni.e., \u03c3 has to fix all the points in Nmn \\ P .\nDefinition 5.6 For any couple (\u03b1, M), where \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) and M is a partition\nsuch that ord \u03b1 + |M| \u2264 n \u2212 m we set\nX X\nc\u03b1,M\n=\n\u03c3 cM\n(5.17)\nn\nQ ,\nP, Q \u03c3\u2208\u0393(\u03b1,P )\n\nwhere P, Q are disjoint subsets in Nmn such that\n| P | = ord \u03b1,\n\n| Q| = |M|.\n34\n\n(5.18)\n\n\fProposition 5.7 Each of the families\nc\u03b1,M\nn\n\nwith\n\nord \u03b1 + |M| = n \u2212 m,\n\n(5.19)\n\nand\nc\u03b1,M\nn\n\nwith ord \u03b1 + |M| \u2264 n \u2212 m,\n\nand M has no part equal to 1,\n\n(5.20)\n\nforms a basis of Zm (n).\nProof. Note that cn\u03b1,M\u222a1\u222a...\u222a1 is proportional to c\u03b1,M\n. Therefore, it suffices to consider\nn\nthe family (5.19). By Proposition 5.5 the elements c\u03b1,M\nwith ord \u03b1 + |M| = n \u2212 m\nn\nare proportional to characteristic functions of the Sm (n)-orbits in \u0393(m, n).\nNow we introduce analogs of the elements \u2206M\nn .\nDefinition 5.8 For any couple (\u03b1, M), where \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) and M is a partition\nsuch that ord \u03b1 + |M| \u2264 n \u2212 m we set\nX X\n\u2206\u03b1,M\n=\n\u03b5(P ) \u03c3 cM\n(5.21)\nn\nQ \u03b5(Q) \u03b5(P ),\nP, Q \u03c3\u2208\u0393(\u03b1,P )\n\nwhere \u03b5(I) := (1 \u2212 \u03b5i1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5ik ) for I = {i1 , . . . , ik }. Here P, Q are disjoint subsets\nin Nmn satisfying (5.18). We set \u22061,\u2205\nn = 1, where \u2205 stands for the empty partition.\n\nNote that (5.21) can be written in an equivalent form where the term \u03b5(Q) takes\nthe leftmost position; cf. (4.13) and (4.16).\nProposition 5.9 The elements \u2206\u03b1,M\nbelong to the algebra Am (n).\nn\nProof. The semigroup \u0393m (n) is generated by the subgroup Sm (n) and the idempotents\n\u03b5m+1 , . . . , \u03b5n . Therefore, it suffices to check that \u2206\u03b1,M\nis stable under the conjugation\nn\nby the elements of Sm (n) and commutes with the idempotents. The first claim is\nimmediate from (5.21). The second claim is verified exactly as its counterpart for the\nelements \u2206M\nn ; see the proof of Proposition 4.4.\nThe following is an analog of Proposition 4.5 and it is proved by the same argument.\n35\n\n\fProposition 5.10 We have\n\u03b8n (\u2206\u03b1,M\n) = \u2206\u03b1,M\nn\u22121 ,\nn\n\n(5.22)\n\nwhere we adopt the convention that\n\u2206\u03b1,M\n=0\nk\n\nif ord \u03b1 + |M| > k \u2212 m.\n\n(5.23)\n\nOur aim now is to prove an analog of Propositions 4.1 and 4.10; see Proposition 5.14 below. We need the following three lemmas.\nLemma 5.11 For m < n\nI(n) \u2229 Am (n) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) Zm (n) (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n(5.24)\n\nProof. Suppose that x \u2208 A(n) can be written as\nx = (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) y (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ),\n\n(5.25)\n\nwhere y \u2208 Zm (n). Then x \u2208 Am (n) since x is invariant under the conjugation by\nthe elements of Sm (n) and is annihilated when multiplied (from the left or from the\nright) by any idempotent \u03b5m+1 , . . . , \u03b5n . Moreover, this also implies that x \u2208 I(n).\nConversely, suppose x \u2208 I(n)\u2229Am (n). Then x \u03b5n = \u03b5n x = 0. Using the invariance\nof x under the conjugation by the elements of Sm (n) we obtain x \u03b5i = \u03b5i x = 0 for\ni = m+1, . . . , n. Thus x is invariant under the multiplication by (1\u2212\u03b5m+1) * * * (1\u2212\u03b5n )\nboth from the left and from the right.\nFurther, we can write x = y + y \u2032 where y and y \u2032 are spanned by elements of\n\u0393(m, n) and \u0393(n) \\ \u0393(m, n), respectively. However,\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) y \u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) = 0\n\n(5.26)\n\nsince for each element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) \\ \u0393(m, n) there exists i > m such that \u03b3 \u03b5i = \u03b3 or\n\u03b5i \u03b3 = \u03b3. This implies\nx = (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) y (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ).\n\n(5.27)\n\nFinally, averaging over the group Sm (n) transforms y into an element of Zm (n); cf.\nthe proof of Lemma 4.7.\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(n), set\nQ(\u03c3) = {i \u2208 Nmn | \u03c3ii = 1}.\n\n36\n\n(5.28)\n\n\fLemma 5.12 The mapping\n\u03c3 7\u2192 \u03b3,\n\n\u03b3 = \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3) = \u03b5Q(\u03c3) \u03c3\n\n(5.29)\n\ndefines a bijection of \u0393(m, n) onto the set of all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) satisfying the conditions\ndom \u03b3 \u2229 Nmn = range \u03b3 \u2229 Nmn ,\n\n(5.30)\n\ndegm \u03b3 = n \u2212 m.\n\n(5.31)\n\nProof. The effect of the multiplication of \u03c3 by \u03b5Q(\u03c3) from the left or from the right\nconsists of replacing all the diagonal entries \u03c3ii = 1 with i > m by zeros. Therefore \u03b3\nsatisfies (5.30). Relation (5.31) follows from this observation and the fact that both\ndom \u03c3 and range \u03c3 contain Nmn .\nConversely, let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(n) satisfy (5.30) and (5.31). Note that (5.30) can be reformulated as follows: for any i = m + 1, . . . , n the i-th row and the i-th column are\nzero or non zero at the same time, whereas (5.31) means that all the diagonal entries\n\u03b3ii with i > m + 1 vanish. Now, let \u03c3 be defined by\n\u03c3ij = \u03b3ij\n\nif either i 6= j or min{i, j} \u2264 m,\n\n\u03c3ii = 1\n\nif i \u2208 Nmn\n\nand the i-th row (or the i-th column) of \u03b3 is zero. Then it is easy to see that\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(m, n) and that \u03b3 is the image of \u03c3 under the mapping (5.29).\n\nLemma 5.13 For m < n the restriction of the projection \u03b8n : Am (n) \u2192 Am (n \u2212 1)\nto the subspace Fmn\u2212m\u22121 (Am (n)) is injective.\nProof. Suppose that x \u2208 Am (n) and \u03b8n (x) = 0. We will show that then degm x =\nn \u2212 m unless x = 0.\nBy Lemma 5.11, x can be written as a linear combination of the elements of type\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n ) \u03c3 (1 \u2212 \u03b5m+1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 \u03b5n )\nX\n(\u22121)| R|+| S| \u03b5R \u03c3 \u03b5S ,\n=\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(m, n). (5.32)\n\nR,S\u2286Nmn\n\nLet us divide the terms in the sum (5.32) into two groups depending on whether\nR \u222a S contains Q(\u03c3) or not. Then the terms of the first group are of m-degree n \u2212 m\nwhereas those of the second group are of m-degree < n \u2212 m. So, it suffices to prove\nthat the elements\nX\n(\u22121)| R|+| S| \u03b5R \u03c3 \u03b5S ,\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(m, n),\n(5.33)\nR\u222aS\u2287 Q(\u03c3)\n\n37\n\n\fare linearly independent. Note that, in the case R \u222a S = Q(\u03c3),\n\u03b5R \u03c3 \u03b5S = \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3)\n\nrank \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3) = rank \u03c3 \u2212 | Q(\u03c3)|,\n\nand\n\n(5.34)\n\nwhereas, in the case R \u222a S strictly contains Q(\u03c3),\nrank \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3) < rank \u03c3 \u2212 | Q(\u03c3)|.\nTherefore, we now need to show that for any fixed k the elements\nX\n(\u22121)| R|+| S| \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3) ,\n\n(5.35)\n\n(5.36)\n\nR\u222aS=Q(\u03c3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 runs over the subset of the elements in \u0393(m, n) with rank \u03c3 \u2212 | Q(\u03c3)| = k,\nare linearly independent.\nLemma 5.12 implies that the elements \u03c3 \u03b5Q(\u03c3) \u2208 \u0393(n) are pairwise distinct. Hence\nit remains to prove that all the coefficients in (5.36) are non-vanishing. This is implied\nby the following general fact: if Q is an arbitrary finite set, then\nX\n(\u22121)| R|+| S| 6= 0.\n(5.37)\nR,S\u2286Q, R\u222aS=Q\n\nWe will prove that the sum\u0012 in\u0013(5.37) equals (\u22121)q where q = | Q|. Indeed, for any\nn\nsubsets R \u2286 Q with | R| = r.

Recall\nthat the algebra A(m) is naturally embedded in Am ; see Proposition 3.7.\nProposition 5.17 The following relations hold in the algebra Am :\nsk uk = uk+1 sk + (1 \u2212 \u03b5k )(1 \u2212 \u03b5k+1),\n\nsk u l = u l sk ,\n\nl 6= k, k + 1; (5.45)\n\nuk ul = ul uk ,\n\n\u03b5i u k = u k \u03b5i ,\n\ni 6= k;\n\n\u03b5k uk = uk \u03b5k = 0,\n\n(5.46)\n\nwhere sk = (k, k + 1).\n(2)\n\n\u2032(2)\n\n\u2032(2)\n\nProof. For n > m we have u1|n = \u2206n \u2212\u2206n\u22121 , where \u2206n\u22121 is the element of the center\nof C[\u03931 (n)] given by (4.13) with the sum taken over the indices from {2, . . . , n}.

For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) and M \u2208 P such that ord \u03b1 + |M| \u2264 n \u2212 m we have\nthe equality in the algebra Am (n),\n1,M\n= \u2206\u03b1,M\n+ lower m-degree terms,\n\u2206\u03b1,\u2205\nn\nn \u2206n\n\n40\n\n(5.48)\n\n\fwhere \u2205 stands for the empty partition while 1 \u2208 \u0393(m, Z+ ) is the m \u00d7 m identity\nmatrix; cf. the proofs of Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.11.
