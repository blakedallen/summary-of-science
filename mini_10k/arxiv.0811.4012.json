Introduction\nAlthough quite large number of publications discusses a synthesis of nano-diamonds during an explosion, the question of its formation and even more\ncommon problem of carbon condensation at detonation of an explosive with negative oxygen balance is\nbeing under discussion till the present time. An answer to this question is important for both the understanding of physics of the phenomenon and for\nthe estimation of energy which is generated during\nexothermal coagulation of carbon clusters.\nThe first direct experimental studies of growth\nof an exploded nano-diamonds became possible due\nto application of synchrotron radiation, namely the\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

The results obtained demonstrated that the intensity of\nSAXS signal started to grow from zero at the detonation front and its growth continued during several\nmicroseconds [1\u20132].\nA hypothesis suggested based on this result,\nthat a creation of carbon particles (including nanodiamonds) takes place beyond the chemical reaction zone (in this case its size is around 0.7 mm).\nHowever this result can be used as well as confirmation of instantaneous creation of exploded nanodiamonds. One has to suppose for that the low value\nof SAXS intensity at the detonation front is due to\nsmall contrast of nano-diamonds. In SAXS method\nthe intensity of scattered signal at the first approximation is proportional to squared difference of\ndensities of the scattering particle and the medium\n(detonation products \u2013 DP). At DP density in the\nbeginning of about 2 g/cm3 the signal can be too\n12 September 2018\n\n\fheight and 12\u201315 mm width. In front of the detector\n(D) the direct beam was closed with another bottom edge (K3). Scattered photons were registered\nby the detector. For additional monitoring a part of\nthe direct beam irradiated the detector through an\nabsorber (1 mm thick copper filter). The distance\nbetween the edges (K1) and (K2) was \u223c 200 mm.\nThe HE charge was at the distance of 700 mm from\nthe edge K2 and at \u223c 640 mm from the edge K3.\nThe distance between the detector and the edge K3\nwas \u223c 200 mm. Scattered radiation was registered\nby the detector DIMEX [3] with the vertical channel\npitch of 0.1 mm. Thus the angular range covered by\nthe measurements was \u223c 0.0068\u20130.34 degrees. During one flash of SR the detector recorded all channels (make one frame) and measured the distribution of SAXS as a function of the angle. As the detonation front moved along the charge axis with constant speed 7.6 km/s the series of frames gave time\ndependence of the SAXS distribution.\nIn the investigated HE TNT/RDX 50/50 the duration of the chemical reaction zone is \u223c 0.1 s [4] and\nthe measurements of SAXS were performed every\n125 ns. VEPP-3 was operating in two bunch mode\nfor this with bunches rotating in the opposite points\nof the orbit. To realize this regime the problems of\npositioning, focusing and phase parameters of the\nbunches were solved.\n\nsmall to be detected and only during DP decay, i.e.\nwhen the density is reduced, it can be registered.\nThis can also explain a tendency for the increase\nof the zone of the signal maximum delay with the\ndiameter of the explosive [2], as DP decay will take\nmore time in such case.\nIn the present work the study of the starting point\nof nano-diamonds formation is performed during\ndetonation of the mixture of TNT/RDX 50/50 with\nSAXS method at the synchrotron radiation (SR)\nbeam of VEPP-3 accelerator. A new experimental\narrangement is applied with nano-diamonds introduced beforehand into the charge of high explosive\n(HE). Known initial presence of nano-diamonds in\npressed HE allows to determine the dynamics of exploded nano-diamonds growth with better precision.\n2. Experimental technique\nExperimental work has been performed in Budker INP (at VEPP-3, wiggler with 2T field, average X-ray energy of 20 keV, bunch frequency of 4-8\nMHz and bunch duration of about 1 ns). Electronic\ncircuit of the detector allows recording of 32 frames\nwith the position distribution of scattered photons\nperformed every 500, 250 or 125 ns. In the last case\nthe storage ring accelerates two bunches rotating at\nthe opposite points at the orbit. As the average current of the accelerator have to stay the same, this\narrangement leads to the decrease of the signal to\nnoise ratio (the dispersion of experimental points is\nlarger), but allows improvement of time resolution.\n\n3. Measurement of the dynamics of SAXS\nfrom high explosives with introduced\nnano-diamonds\nThe intensity of SAXS from mono-dispersed system of nano-particles can be described by the following formulae:\nI(s) = n(t) (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 )2 F (s),\nwhere s = s \u2212 s0 \u2013 vector of scattering (|s| =\n4\u03c0 sin \u03b8/\u03bb), 2\u03b8 \u2013 scattering angle, \u03bb \u2013 wavelength of\nradiation), n(t) \u2013 number of nano-particles of density \u03c1 in a unit volume, \u03c10 \u2013 density of the medium,\nF (s) \u2013 form-factor of an individual particle.\nIn the present experiments the maximal registered\nscattering angle was 2\u03b8max = 0.014, minimum angle\nwas 2\u03b8min = 0.0006. Integration in this range of angles leads to the following formulae for the integral\nintensity of SAXS:\n\nFig. 1. Layout of the SAXS experiment using synchrotron\nradiation.\n\nThe experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. The\nSR beam was collimated with the bottom (K1) and\ntop (K2) edges, and irradiation zone was formed at\nthe central part of the explosive charge with 1 mm\n\nI0 (\u03bb, R) \u223c R 6 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 )2 N .\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fTotal SAXS intensity can be obtained by integration through all wavelengths according to the spectrum of irradiation from VEPP-3 storage ring.\nIn the performed experiments the intensity in (1)\nis summed from scattering on atoms (molecules) and\nscattering on nano-particles. Analysis shows that\nscattering on atoms is constant and small due to\nstrong dependence on the size in (1). The registered\ndependence can be obtained only from relatively\nlarge particles of \u223c 2\u20134 nm size. In the conditions of\nthe performed experiments the minimal size of detected particles is equal to dmin \u2248 \u03bb/\u03b8max \u2248 2.8 nm,\nwhere \u03bb = 0.04 nm is wavelength at the energy E =\n30 keV.\nMaximal size of particles is determined by minimal registered scattering angle \u03b8min , that is given by\nthe accuracy of alignment of the edge that is closing the direct SR beam (around 0.5 mm). For the\npresent experiments dmax \u2248 \u03bb/\u03b8min \u2248 70 .\nSAXS method does not allow distinguishing of\nsignals from nano-diamonds and non-diamond carbon forms. As shown in [5] fraction of nano-diamond\nin a solid residue can reach 80% (for initial HE\nTNT/RDX 50/50).\nIn all experiments detecting SAXS [2] the signal\nstarted from zero in the zone of maximal compression. One of the possible reasons of such behavior of\nSAXS can be very low contrast (\u03c1D \u2212 \u03c11 )2 of nanodiamond in this moment. At the density of HE in\nthe chemical reaction zone of about \u03c11 \u223c 2.1 g/m3\nthe SAXS signal might not be visible for the detector and only during the decay of detonation products, i.e. reduction of the density, it becomes detectable. Thus it is necessary to know if this method\ncan distinguish condensed nano-diamonds (\u03c1D \u223c\n3.5 g/cm3) at the background of shock compressed\nHE.\nIn order to answer this question the experiments\non SAXS measurements were performed with detonation of TNT and RDX with introduced 8%\n(weight fraction) of nano-diamonds produced by\nNPO \"Altaj\". Such amount of nano-diamonds corresponds to its yield at detonation of TNT/RDX\n50/50 [5].\nThe results of the measurements of SAXS are\nshown in Fig.2. The initial signal level in TNT and\nRDX (curves B and D) corresponds to 8% of introduced nano-diamonds. At the moment when detonation front passes through (zero moment in the figure) their SAXS signal is reduced proportionally to\nthe change of contrast. For RDX the change of signal have to be equal to factor of (\u03c1D \u2212 \u03c11 )2 /(\u03c1D \u2212\n\nFig. 2. Dependence of integral small-angle scattering on time\nat the detonation of charges of TNT(B), RDX(D) with introduced 8% of ultra-dispersed diamonds, and also of mixture\nof TNT/RDX 50/50 (C).\n\n\u03c10 )2 = 1.89 where \u03c1D \u223c 3.5 g/cm3 is density of\nnano-diamonds, \u03c10 \u223c 1.71 g/cm3 is initial density of\nRDX and \u03c11 \u223c 2.2 g/cm3 is its maximal density.\nFor TNT the reduction of signal is equal to a factor of (\u03c1D \u2212 \u03c11 )2 /(\u03c1D \u2212 \u03c10 )2 = 1.6, where \u03c10 =\n1.69 g/cm3 and \u03c11 = 2.08 g/cm3 are corresponding\ndensities for TNT. From the plot one can see that\nthe level of SAXS signal is one order of magnitude\nhigher than the zero level (noise level). If at detonation of TNT/RDX 50/50 all nano-diamonds were\nproduced within narrow chemical reaction zone (in\n\u223c 0.1 \u03bcs), the jump of SAXS signal to the same\nlevel as in TNT and RDX with introduced nanodiamonds must be observed in this zone. The behavior of SAXS for TNT/RDX 50/50 (the curve C)\ndemonstrates that in the chemical reaction zone the\nsignal is practically equal to zero and minimal level\nof curves B and D is reached after \u223c 0.75 \u03bcs that\nsignificantly exceeds duration of the chemical reaction. The contrast factor in experiments B and C is\npractically the same as their decay dynamics of the\nexplosion products differs a little. The SAXS signal in TNT/RDX 50/50 smoothly grows due to the\nincrease of the number of nano-particles and their\nsizes (1), that does not confirm instant creation of\ndetonation nano-diamonds. Due to specially taken\nmeasures the accuracy of time alignment of results of\ndifferent experiments is not worse than 20 ns. Phase\nshift between curves B and C at similar level of the\nsignal significantly exceeds this value.\nBehind the detonation front the curve of SAXS\nof RDX with nano-diamonds passes far below the\n3\n\n\fone of TNT in spite of that the decay of detonation\nproducts in these two cases is approximately the\nsame. Such behavior of SAXS means destruction of\nnano-diamonds in the decaying detonation products\nof RDX. And combustion happens not instantly, but\nbehind the chemical reaction zone.\n4. Conclusion\nThe performed experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed method of measurement of SAXS reliably distinguishes exploded nano-diamonds at the\nbackground of substance compressed in a detonation wave. At detonation of TNT/RDX 50/50 carbon condensation into nano-diamonds (with sizes\n> 2 nm) occurs behind the chemical reaction zone.\n\nReferences\n[1] O.V. Evdokov, M.G. Fedotov, N.Z.
