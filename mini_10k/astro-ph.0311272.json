Seidov\n\narXiv:astro-ph/0311272v1 12 Nov 2003\n\nResearch Institute, College of Judea and Samaria, Ariel 44837,Israel\nzakirs@yosh.ac.il\nSeptember 22, 2018\nABSTRACT\nExact analytical formulae are derived for the potential and mass ratio as a\nfunction of Lagrangian points position, in the classical Roche model of the close\nbinary stars.\nSubject headings: stars: rotation-binaries: close\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Roche model is widely used in interpretation of the close binary star observations.\nSeveral authors derived the various approximations to solve the Roche problem and presented\nnumerical tables, see e.g. Plavec & Kratochvil (1964); Kippenhahn & Thomas (1970);\nEggleton (1983); Mochnacki (1984); Morris (1985, 1994). Not intending to solve the whole\nproblem analytically, I rather show here the way how some analytical relations can be found.\nThe idea is to reverse the problem: instead of finding, e.g., the first Lagrangian point, x1 , as\nfunction of binary mass ratio q we seek solution for q as function of x1 .\n\n2.\n\nBasic equation\n\nThe basic equation of the classic Roche problem is the formula for surfaces of the\n(primary) star as equipotential :\n\u03a8(x, y, z) =\n\n\u0012\n\nq\nx\u2212\n1+q\n\n\u00132\n\n2q\n\n+ y2 +\n(1 + q)\n\nq\n\n(\u22121 + x)2 + y 2 + z 2\n\n+\n\n2\np\n.\n(1 + q) x2 + y 2 + z 2\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nI use in eq. (1) notations of Mochnacki (1984): the x axis is aligned along the stars' centers, z\naxis is parallel to the rotation axis, \u03a8 is \"normalized\" potential, in units of G(M1 +M2 )/(2 A),\nq = M2 /M1 < 1, and x, y, z are in units of A, the distance between the centers of binary\ncomponents with masses M1 and M2 . As I here consider only the first (inner) and second\n(outer) Lagrangian points problem, it is sufficient to consider the eq. (1) at the x axis.\n\n3.\n\nThe first Lagrangian point\n\nWe write down eq. (1) with y = z = 0, 0 < x < 1, and look for the minimum of the\nfunction:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2q\n2\nq\n\u03a81 (x) =\n+\n+ x\u2212\n.\n(2)\n(1 + q) (1 \u2212 x) (1 + q) x\n1+q\nat some x = x1 , with 0 < x1 < 1. The important observation, from eq. (2), is that\n\u03a81 (q, x) = \u03a81 (1/q, 1 \u2212 x), if 0 < x < 1 (not in general case!). From eq. (2), we find the\ncondition d \u03a81 (x)/dx = 0, which we rewrite after some algebra as function of q(x1 ):\n(1 \u2212 x1 )3 (1 + x1 + x21 )\n.\nq(x1 ) =\nx31 (3 \u2212 3 x1 + x21 )\n\n(3)\n\nWe notice, from eq. (3), the elegant relation (also having a clear physical meaning) q(x1 ) q(1\u2212\nx1 ) = 1. We underline that eq. (3) gives the fully analytical and exact relation between values\nof q and of the first Lagrangian point x1 . See, e.g. table 1 in (Mochnacki 1984), where Q\nand X1 stand for our q and x1 , respectively, and compare the difference in difficulty of\ncalculations by method of Mochnacki (1984) and by formulas (3,4,6,9) of this note.\nNow in order to find value of the potential corresponding to the first Lagrangian point,\nwe may use the eqs. (2) and (3) together, or, in the spirit of this note, exclude q from eqs.\n(2) and (3) and find explicit function \u03a81 (x1 ):\n\u03a81 (x1 ) =\n\n3 \u2212 12 t + 15 t2 \u2212 10 t3 \u2212 4 t4\n; t = x1 (1 \u2212 x1 ).\n(\u22121 + 2 t + t2 )2\n\n(4)\n\nWe introduced the additional variable t into Eq. (4) in order to explicitly show that \u03a81 (x1 ) =\n\u03a81 (1 \u2212 x1 ) if 0 < x1 < 1 (not in general case!). Eq. (4) gives the fully analytical and exact\nrelation between the values of the first Lagrangian point x1 and of the corresponding potential\n\u03a81 (x1 ). See, e.g. table 1 in (Mochnacki 1984), where C1 and X1 stand for our \u03a81 (x1 ) and\nx1 , respectively.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n4.\n\nThe second Lagrangian point\n\nNow we look for minimum of the function (note the difference from eq. [2]):\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2\nq\n2q\n+\n+ x\u2212\n,\n\u03a82 (x) =\n(1 + q) (x \u2212 1) (1 + q) x\n1+q\n\n(5)\n\nat some x = x2 , with 1 < x2 < 2. Repeating the procedure of the section 3, we get the\nsolution for q as function of x2 :\n(x2 \u2212 1)3 (1 + x2 + x22 )\nq(x2 ) = 2\n.\nx2 (2 \u2212 x2 ) (1 \u2212 x2 + x22 )\n\n(6)\n\nWe notice that by contrast with eq. (3), it is not evident from eq. (6) that we have the\nrelation q(x2 ) q(1 \u2212 x2 ) = 1, because here x2 > 1, but (1 \u2212 x2 ) < 0, while the eq. (6) is\nderived under condition 1 < x2 < 2; in the case of eq. (3), both x1 and (1 \u2212 x1 ) were in the\n(open) interval (0,1)).\nTo prove the validity of the relation q(x2 ) q(1 \u2212 x2 ) = 1, we should return to the basic\nequation (1), put there y = z = 0, x < 0, and look for the minimum of the function:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2q\n2\nq\n\u03a83 (x) =\n\u2212\n+ x\u2212\n,\n(7)\n(1 + q) (1 \u2212 x) (1 + q) x\n1+q\nat some x = x3 , with x3 < 0. Note the differences between functions \u03a81 (x), \u03a82 (x), and\n\u03a83 (x). Repeating above procedure for \u03a83 (x), we get:\nq(x3 ) =\n\n(2 \u2212 x3 ) x23 (1 \u2212 x3 + x23 )\n.\n(x3 \u2212 1)3 (1 + x3 + x23 )\n\n(8)\n\nNow, from eqs. (6) and (8), we have q(x2 ) q(x3 ) = 1, if x3 = 1 \u2212 x2 , and if x2 > 1, x3 =\n1 \u2212 x2 < 0, QED. Eq. (6) (together with eq. [8]) gives the fully analytical and exact relation\nbetween q and the value of the second Lagrangian point x2 . See, e.g. table 1 in (Mochnacki\n1984), where Q and X2 stand for our q and x2 , respectively.\nNow in order to find value of the potential corresponding to the second Lagrangian\npoint, we may use the eqs. (5) and (6) together, or, again in the spirit of this note, exclude\nq from eqs. (5) and (6) and find explicit function \u03a82 (x2 ):\n\u03a82 (x2 ) =\n\n\u22121 \u2212 4 x2 + 27 x22 \u2212 36 x32 + 9 x42 + 18 x52 \u2212 14 x62 + 4 x72\n(\u22121 + 2 x2 + x22 \u2212 2 x32 + x42 )\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nEq. (9) gives the fully analytical and exact relation between the values of the second Lagrangian point x2 and of the corresponding potential \u03a82 (x2 ). See, e.g. table 1 in (Mochnacki\n1984), where C2 and X2 stand for our \u03a82 (x2 ) and x2 , respectively.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this short note we present the exact analytical relations for the first and second\nLagrangian point of the classical Roche problem. In practice, the \"exact\" formulas are not\nnecessarily the most convenient ones, hence different approximate expressions in literature\n(see (Kopal 1959; Plavec & Kratochvil 1964; Kippenhahn & Thomas 1970; Eggleton\n1983; Mochnacki 1984; Morris 1985, 1994), among others), and some relevant approximate\nformulas will be given elsewhere. Still, the exact formulas have their own beauty and are\nmore relevant as solutions to the classical problems such as the problem by Roche (1847).\nMy thanks are due to anonymous referee for encouraging criticism.\n\nREFERENCES\nEggleton, P.
