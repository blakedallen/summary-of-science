In particular, it has been shown in [9] that the Maxwell equations describing the propa\u2217\n\nSupported in part by the COFIN PRIN \"SINTESI\" 2002.\n\n1\n\n\fgation of the light through the Cole-Cole weakly three-dimensional nonlinear\nmedium admit an integrable geometrical optics limit.\nIn this limit the system is governed by the dispersionless Veselov-Novikov\n \u0304\n(dVN) hierarchy, which is amenable by the quasiclassical \u2202-dressing\nmethod [10].\nA reduction method based on the symmetry constraints [15] appears to\nbe an efficient approach to calculate solutions of the dVN equation [16].\nIn what follows we will focus on a 1+1-dimensional reduction when the\nrefractive index does not depend on one coordinate. In this case dVN hierarchy is reduced to the so-called Burgers-Hopf (BH) hierarchy. For sake of\nsimplicity we will focus on the first equations of the hierarchy, the so-called\ndVN and Burgers-Hopf equations, respectively.\nIn this regard, it is quite interesting to interpret some of the properties\nof BH equation within the specific context of nonlinear geometrical optics.\nOne of them concerns the existence of breaking wave solutions. They could\nbe useful to model dielectrics which present a kind of \"impurities\" inducing\nabrupt variations of the refractive index. Indeed, it can be seen that, at\nso-called breaking points, the curvature of the light rays blows up just like it\nhappens at interface between different media.\nLet us start with the Maxwell equations in a dielectric medium\n\u2202D\n=0 \u2207*D=0\n\u2202t\n\u2202B\n\u2207\u2227E+\n=0 \u2207*B =0\n\u2202t\n\n\u2207\u2227H\u2212\n\n(1)\n\nalong with the constitutive equations\nD = \u03b5E,\n\nB = \u03bcH.\n\n(2)\n\nLooking for monochromatic solutions\nE (x, y, z, t) = E0 (x, y, z) e\u2212i\u03c9t\nH (x, y, z, t) = H0 (x, y, z) e\u2212i\u03c9t ,\n\n(3)\n\none gets from (1-2) the following well-known second order equations\n\u22072 E0 + \u03c9 2 \u03bc\u03b5E0 + (\u2207 log \u03bc) \u2227 (\u2207 \u2227 E0 ) + \u2207 (E0 * \u2207 log \u03b5) = 0\n\u22072 H0 + \u03c9 2 \u03bc\u03b5H0 + (\u2207 log \u03b5) \u2227 (\u2207 \u2227 H0 ) + \u2207 (H0 * \u2207 log \u03bc) = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nMedium under study is characterized by the following set of properties [9, 10]:\n2\n\n\f1. \u03b5 and \u03bc obeys the Cole-Cole dispersion law\n\u03b5\u0303\n,\n1 + (i\u03c9\u03c40 )2\u03bd\n\u03bc\u0303\n,\n\u03bc = \u03bc0 +\n1 + (i\u03c9\u03c40 )2\u03bd\n\u03b5 = \u03b50 +\n\n0<\u03bd<\n\n1\n2\n\n(5)\n\nWe highlight that the range of values of the exponent \u03bd plays a crucial\nrole in the construction of an integrable high frequency limit.\n2. \u03b50 and \u03bc0 depend only on the coordinates x, y and z, while \u03b5\u0303 and \u03bc\u0303\nare assumed to be depending on the coordinates, the fields and the\nspatial derivatives of the fields. The latter can be explained in terms\nof a mechanism of short-range non-locality by means of an integral\nconstitutive relation among the electric field E and the displacement\nvector D [10].\n3. All quantities, in high frequency limit show slow dependence on the\nvariable z formally given by\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u03c9 \u2212\u03bd .\n\u2202z\n\u2202\u03be\nwhere \u03be is a \"slow\" variable defined by z = \u03c9 \u03bd \u03be.\nMoreover, any of such a quantity f (x, y, z) can be expanded in asymptotic series on the parameter \u03c9 \u03bd\nf (x, y, z) = f (x, y, \u03be) + \u03c9 \u2212\u03bd f1 (x, y, \u03be) + \u03c9 \u22122\u03bd f2 (x, y, \u03be) + . . . .\nRepresenting\nE0 = \u1ebc0 ei\u03c9S ,\n\nH0 = H\u03030 ei\u03c9S ,\n\n(6)\n\nand using the previous assumptions in one of equations (4), in high frequency\nlimit (\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e) one gets in the orders \u03c9 2 and \u03c9 2\u22122\u03bd the main non-trivial\ncontributions [9, 10]\nSx2 + Sy2 = 4u,\n\n(7)\n\nS\u03be = \u03c6 (x, y, \u03be, Sx, Sy ) .\n\n(8)\n\nEquation (7) is the standard eikonal equation in two dimensions, \u03c6 is a certain function and 4u = \u03b50 \u03bc0 . As discussed in the paper [10] the equations (7)\n3\n\n\fand (8) constitute an overdetermined system for the phase S. The compatibility condition imposes specific restrictions on the possible forms of the\nfunction \u03c6 and the admissible refractive indices u. If \u03c6 is a polynomial differential of S, the first non-trivial case is given by the third degree polynomial,\ni.e.\n1\n3\n\u03c6 = Sx3 \u2212 Sx Sy2 + V1 Sx + V2 Sy .\n(9)\n4\n4\nThe compatibility condition gives\nu\u03be = (V1 u)x + (V2 u)y\nV1x \u2212 V2y = \u22123ux\nV2x + V1y = 3uy ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is the dVN equation. In the paper [16] it has been shown how symmetry constraints allow us to construct its 1+1-dimensional reductions of\nhydrodynamic type. A number of explicit solutions for the complex dVN\nequation have been discussed in [10].\nParticular situation in which refractive index depend only on one coordinate on the plane x-y is of physical interest too. So, let us assume that\nuy = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nAs a consequence of the eikonal equation (7) the phase function S must\nsatisfy the condition Sy = c, with c = const, then\nS = cy + S\u0303(x, \u03be)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere S\u0303 does not depend on y. Eikonal equation (7) becomes\nS\u0303x2 = 4u \u2212 c2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhile, choosing V2 = 0, one gets\nV1 = \u22123u,\nand the dVN equation (10) is reduced to the Burgers-Hopf (BH) equation\nu\u03be + 6uux = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nSolutions of BH equation can be expressed in the following hodograph form [17]\nx \u2212 6u\u03be + \u03c8(u) = 0,\n4\n\n(15)\n\n\fu\n\n\u03be<\u03be\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03be = \u03be\u2217\n\nu\n\nx\n\nx\n\nu\n\n\u03be > \u03be\u2217\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: Typical breaking solution of Burgers-Hopf equation. Beyond breaking point\n(\u03be > \u03be \u2217 ) function u becomes multi-valued.\n\nwhere \u03c8 is an arbitrary function of its argument. Moreover, once calculated\nu(x, \u03be) by the (15) the phase function is given explicitly\nZ \u221a\nS = cy \u00b1\n4u \u2212 c2 dx.\n(16)\nShock structure of the Burgers-Hopf equation is connected to the existence\nof a value \u03be \u2217 (breaking point), for which\nux \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(17)\n\nIn the theory of partial differential equations these solutions are called breaking waves. It is a textbook exercise to calculate the breaking point [17]. For\ninstance, choosing the initial datum u(x0 , 0) = (1 \u2212 tanh x0 )/6 the breaking\npoint is \u03be \u2217 = 1 (see figure 1).\nWe remark that, as discussed in [18], the singular sector of BH hierarchy\ninduces a stratification of the affine space of independent variables which\ngives rise to the integrable deformations of hyperelliptic curves.\nThe propagation of the light on the plane \u03c0 : \u03be = \u03be0 (\u03be0 = const) is\ngoverned by the standard eikonal equation (7). Denoting by \u03a3 the congruence\non \u03c0 normal to the family of curves S(x, y, \u03be0) = \u03bb, parametrized by \u03bb, the\ncurvature of \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3 can be represented by the well known formula [19]\n1\n\u03ba=\n\u03bd * \u2207u,\n(18)\n2u\nwhere \u2207 = (\u2202x , \u2202y ) and \u03bd = (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) is the unit principal normal to \u03b3 on\nthe plane \u03c0. Now, let us observe that the curve \u03b3 coincides locally with the\nprojection of the light ray on the plane \u03c0.\n5\n\n\fn1\n20\n\n10\n\nt\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n-10\n\n-20\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx\n\nFigure 2: Density plot of the real part of the refractive index n = n1 + in2.

This is the typical behavior which light rays exhibit on the interface\nbetween different materials. This type of solutions could be useful to describe\nsituations where light rays propagate in the non-homogeneous medium and\nat certain point they cross some kind of impurity. These impurities with\ndrastically different optical properties could be responsible of the abrupt\nchange of direction.\nAs well known in electrodynamics, complex-valued refractive indices also\nhave a physical meaning since they can be used to describe absorption effects\nof radiation. In this specific case, complex values of the refractive index n are\nassociated with a strong damping of the electromagnetic wave. We illustrate\nthis fact by the following explicit example.\nLet us consider a solution obtained from the hodograph relation (15)\nsetting \u03c8(u) = u2 . Expliciting u from (15) and using it in the expression (16),\none gets\n\u0011\np\n1\u0010\n\u22126\u03be + 36\u03be 2 \u2212 4x ,\n(20)\nu=\n2\nq\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\np\np\n4\u221a\nS=\n2 \u22126\u03be + 36\u03be 2 \u2212 4x 6\u03be \u22126\u03be + 36\u03be 2 \u2212 4x + 12x . (21)\n15\n\u221a\nWe note that the refractive index n = 2 u (we do not consider negative\nrefractive indices) is not real-valued on whole plane x-\u03be. Inside regions in\n7\n\n\fwhich the refractive index takes a complex contribution even the phase function S becomes complex-valued. Thus, writing S = S1 + iS2 , if S2 > 0 the\nelectric field acquires a damping factor\nE = E0 e\u2212\u03c9S2 ei\u03c9S1 .\n\n(22)\n\nIn this regions strong absorptions effects are occurring. \u221a\nFigure 2 shows the real part of refractive index n = 2 u. The dashed line\nmarks the region where the refractive index acquires an imaginary contribution. This has been visualized in the three-dimensional plot in the figure 3-a.\nJust where refractive index becomes complex-valued, the phase S takes an\nimaginary contribution indicating a strong absorption (see figure 3-b).\nFigure 4 shows the wave fronts configuration in the plane x-\u03be. Shaded region\nrepresents the absorption region. For \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u221e we have an almost plane\nwave front. Towards absorption region, wave fronts deform itself following\nlevel lines of refractive index. Just before absorption wave fronts present a\ndeviation of an almost right angle.\n\nReferences\n[1] I.K. Kostov, I. Krichever, M. Mineev-Weinstein, P.B.
