Numerical models involving merging, cooling and feedback (e.g., Somerville & Primack 1999;\nKauffmann et al. 1999; Benson et al. 2003) produce definite predictions for the luminosity function in various environments, which\ncan now be compared with photometric observations of wide-field\nand deep samples of galaxies of the field and in highly clustered\nregions.\nThe galaxian luminosity function (LF) is usually modelled as the Schechter function, which drops sharply at bright\nmagnitudes, but rises at the faint end as a power-law of\nslope \u03b1. In cold dark matter (CDM) dominated models; dwarf\ngalaxy haloes collapsing at z > 3 have very efficient cooling, resulting in a steep slope \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122 at the faint end of\nthe mass function (e.g., Evrard 1989; White & Frenk 1991;\nKauffmann, White, & Guiderdoni 1993). However, in practice, observed galaxy samples over large samples usually yield \u03b1 \u2248\n\u22121 (e.g., Loveday et al. 1995, APM-Stromlo, bJ -band). Steeper\nfaint-end slopes have been found (e.g., Trentham & Tully 2002;\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: tm@star.sr.bham.ac.uk\n\nde Propris et al. 2003; Trentham, Sampson, & Banerji 2005), and\nthere is some indication that this is dependent on environment, and\non the photometric filter used (e.g., Blanton et al. 2005). Ways\nof reconciling LFs of the luminous component with the predicted\nmass function of dark haloes have variously invoked effects of the\nphysics of cooling and ionization (e.g., Chiu, Gnedin, & Ostriker\n2001; Somerville 2002).\nRecently, with the help of deep photometry of the nearby Universe, the faint end of the LF has been explored in various surveys,\nrevealing features that makes it difficult to fit a single Schechter\nfunction to the entire data (e.g., Trentham, Tully, & Mahdavi 2006;\nBlanton et al. 2005). Indeed, many recent studies suggest that the\nLF of brighter galaxies (MB < \u221218.5) should be modelled as\na Gaussian, while that of the fainter ones be represented as a\nSchechter function (e.g., Jerjen 1997; Mahdavi et al. 2005). This\napproach seeks to explain the peaks and dips in the LF as due to a\nvarying mix of galaxies of different morphological types in different environments, and highlights the connection between the evolution of galaxies and their local environment.\nA good example is the luminosity function of galaxies in\nHickson compact groups, where a prominent deficit (\"dip\") was\nfound at intermediate luminosities (Hunsberger et al. 1998), showing that a single Schechter function would be inadequate to de-\n\n\f2\n\nTrevor A. Miles et al.\n\nscribe these LFs. Indeed, even in the Coma cluster, various studies\n(e.g., Thompson & Gregory 1993; Lobo et al. 1997; Tully 2005)\nhave found that optical LF of galaxies in the cluster have features\nnot described by a Schechter function.\nIn a previous paper (Miles et al. 2004), we presented optical (B and R-band) LFs of a sample of 25 nearby groups of\ngalaxies, as part of the Group Evolution Multiwavelength Study\n(Forbes et al. 2006; Osmond & Ponman 2004; Khosroshahi et al.\n2004; Raychaudhury & Miles 2006, GEMS), for which we have Xray luminosities (some have upper limits) from ROSAT PSPC observations. To investigate the overall shape of the LF, we stacked together the LFs of several groups, with galaxies chosen from within\n0.3 R500 from the centre of each group. We found that the LF of the\nX-ray dim groups (LX < 1041.7 erg s\u22121 ) were significantly different from those of the X-ray brighter groups, showing a prominent\ndip, similar to Coma, at around MB = \u221218. We interpreted this\ndeficiency of intermediate-luminosity galaxies as evidence of rapid\nevolution through merging, since X-ray dim groups have lower\nvelocity dispersion, which would encourage tidal interaction and\nmerging by means of enhanced dynamical friction.\nThere have been alternative explanations suggested for\nthe various features seen in LFs. Some have argued (e.g.,\nFerguson & Sandage 1991; Jerjen 1997) that the total luminosity\nfunction of a group or cluster has features due to a varying morphological mix across various systems. Others (e.g., Biviano et al.\n1995) have suggested that the apparent dip in the optical LF might\nactually be an enhancement of the bright end of the LF, due to excess star formation caused by tidal effects in the inner regions of\nthe cluster or group.\nWe address these issues in this paper. To investigate whether\nthe shape of the optical LF is affected by variation in the star formation properties of galaxies, we examine the near-infrared LFs of\na large well-defined sample of groups of galaxies, namely the 60\ngroups of the GEMS study. The JHK photometry from the 2MASS\nsurvey is likely to trace evolved stellar populations and hence the\ntotal stellar content of galaxies, and thus can be better compared\nwith galaxy formation models. It also allows us to avoid the effects\nof extinction that plague optical studies.\nIn the following section, we analyse 2MASS photometry of\ngalaxies belonging to the 60 GEMS groups, and, by splitting them\ninto two categories based on their X-ray luminosity, compare their\nK-band LFs with our earlier B-band LFs for a subset of 25 groups\n(Miles et al. 2004). In \u00a73, we examine how the luminosity functions of X-ray bright and dim groups change with projected radial\ndistance from group centre. We address the issue of the shape of\nthe LF depending on the mix of various morphological types in\n\u00a74, where we compute model luminosity functions resulting from\nthe summation of the LFs of individual galaxy types. In the final\nsection, we discuss the implications in the context of the evolution\nof galaxies in groups. We have used H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ;\n\u03a90 \u2261 \u03a9M = 1 throughout.\n\nFigure 1. An illustration of the colour-magnitude selection, showing the\nNGC 4636 group, which has the highest number of known galaxy redshifts\nin the GEMS sample. Group members, ascertained on the basis of measured\nredshift, are plotted as crosses, and non-group galaxies as circles. The range\nof the expected red sequence, as described in the text, is plotted as a pair of\nlines. The non-group galaxies, within the width of the red sequence down\nto our magnitude limit (K = 13.5), will be removed by our background\nsubtraction method shown Fig. 2\n\nFigure 2. Estimating the background: for each group, we select 100 random fields (of the same area as a R500 circle for that group) around it,\nand compute the total number of galaxies in each K-band apparent magnitude bin. Here, triangles represent such a plot for the NGC 5044 group.\nThe circles represent those galaxies that survive the colour-magnitude selection criterion applied from that group. Finally, the squares represent the\ncircles divided by one hundred, this being the \"background\" histogram to\nbe subtracted when constructing the LF for this group. The trail-off at the\nfaint end shows the incompleteness of the 2MASS catalogue fainter than\nMK =13.75 (Jarrett 2000).\n\n2 NEAR-INFRARED LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS OF\nGROUPS\nOur sample of 60 nearby groups of galaxies, known as the Group\nEvolution Multi-wavelength Study (GEMS), is described in detail in Osmond & Ponman (2004) and Forbes et al. (2006). It was\ncompiled to represent a wide variety of groups over a large range\nstages of evolution. First, a master sample of of over 4000 optically\nidentified groups was constructed from the literature, from which\n\nonly those that were found to be within the field of a ROSAT PSPC\npointed observation with integration time >10 ks, were chosen\nas members of the GEMS sample. A large fraction of the GEMS\ngroups were found to have been detected in these pointed PSPC\nobservations, and for the remaining few we have upper limits for\ntheir X-ray flux.\n\n\fBimodal Infrared luminosity functions in galaxy groups\n2.1 Galaxy Selection and background subtraction\nThe 2MASS All-Sky Data Release catalogue contains more\nthan 1.6 million extended sources, with a limiting magnitude of\nMK =13.75 (Jarrett 2000). For each GEMS group, we selected all\nobjects, belonging to the 2MASS All-Sky Extended Source Catalog\n(2MASX), within a circle of radius R500 (radius out to which the\nmass overdensity is 500 times the mean density of the Universe) of\nits centre. The adopted group centres, values of R500 and distances\nto these groups can be found in Osmond & Ponman (2004).\nThe J \u2212 K colours were calculated from the isophotal\nmagnitudes (Ks = 20 mag arcsec\u22122 ). Galaxies were selected\nas being likely group members from the red sequences of\nthe colour-magnitude diagram, involving the (J \u2212 K) colour\nand the Ks magnitude The width of the red sequence was\nbased on the Coma Cluster U \u2212 V colour-magnitude relation of\nTerlevich, Caldwell & Bower (2001), its 3\u03c3 width being converted\nto a J \u2212K width based on Jarrett (2000).\nFig. 1 illustrates this for the case of the NGC 4636 group,\nwhich has the highest number of known galaxy redshifts in the\nGEMS sample. It has 80 measured redshifts within R500 (most\nGEMS groups have under 10 measured redshifts within this radius\nand 21 groups have under 5 redshifts). The colour-magnitude diagram shows group galaxies as crosses, and non-group galaxies as\ncircles. The non-group galaxies that are within the 3 \u2212 \u03c3 are all\nfaint and are then removed by our background subtraction method.\nout to the magnitude limit used here (K < 13.5).\nGiven that the number of galaxies in each group is small, the\nluminosity functions may be affected significantly by the method\nof background subtraction. For this reason, for each group, we took\na large sample of field galaxies from 100 randomly-selected, independent, regions on the sky, each of radius equal to the value of\nR500 for the group. We then calculated the mean number of galaxies occupying each magnitude bin and subtracted them from the\ntarget group. The whole process was then repeated for every group\nin the GEMS sample.\nFig. 2 shows one such example, where the raw number of\ngalaxies found in these field regions is shown as triangles, binned\nin apparent Ks magnitude. Open circles show all field galaxies\nfrom these 100 regions satisfying the C-M selection criterion for\nthe group. The open squares show those galaxies surviving the C-M\ncut divided by 100, representing the average number of local background and foreground galaxies expected in each bin of apparent\nmagnitude. In this way we aimed to account for cosmic variance\nand to have compiled as unbiased a selection of field galaxies as\npossible.\n\n3 LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS OF X-RAY BRIGHT AND\nDIM GROUPS\nSince the number of member galaxies in each individual group is\nsmall, the galaxian luminosity function (LF) of the groups was evaluated by co-adding galaxies of several groups in equally spaced\nbins of absolute luminosity.\nAn apparent magnitude cut-off was adopted at K = 13.5, since\nFig. 2 shows that the samples of 2MASS galaxies, in 100 randomlyselected field regions, is reasonably complete to K \u223c13.75 (cf.\nJarrett 2000). The resulting limit in absolute magnitude varies between groups\u2013 the distance moduli of the 60 groups range between\n30.1 and 35.5, with the median of 32.5. Hence, co-added LFs were\nevaluated by dividing the number of co-added galaxies in each bin\n\n3\n\nof absolute magnitude by the number of contributory groups to that\nbin. When plotting the group LFs, we chose a conservative absolute magnitude limit of MK < \u221220 so that the faintest bin contains over half of groups within the 2MASS completeness limit of\nK < 13.5.\nVarious optical and X-ray properties of GEMS groups may\nbe found in Osmond & Ponman (2004) and Forbes et al. (2006).\nThe groups in our sample represent very diverse systems in terms\nof their content and physical properties. We divide our sample of\ngalaxies into two sub-classes according to the X-ray luminosity of\ntheir parent groups, which is related to the mass and velocity dispersion of the latter.\nAs in Miles et al. (2004), we use the X-ray luminosities measured by Osmond & Ponman (2004), who used ROSAT PSPC observations in the 0.5\u20132 keV range, fitting \u03b2-profiles after point\nsource removal, extrapolated to estimate the bolometric X-ray luminosity. We characterised the parent groups as X-ray bright if their\nbolometric X-ray luminosity is more than the median of the sample,\nLX = 1041.7 erg s\u22121 , and X-ray dim if less. This X-ray luminosity refers to that of the group plus of any central galaxy that might\nexist.\n3.1 Stacked Near-Infrared Luminosity Functions within\n0.3R500\nThe differential galaxian Luminosity Functions of the 25 GEMS\nGroups that made up our earlier optical sample (Miles et al. 2004)\nabove are shown in Fig. 3 in B and K-bands, out to 0.3 R500 , for\ndirect comparison between the optical and near-IR LFs. As in the\noptical LFs (B, as shown here, and in R) analysed in Miles et al.\n(2004), a clear difference between the LFs of the X-ray bright\ngroups and X-ray dim groups is evident, with a depletion in the\nnumber of galaxies with magnitudes between \u221224 < MK < \u221223\nand \u221223 < MJ < \u221222 for the latter category of groups. The possibility that these dips are due to some of the galaxies being systematically missed can be ruled out. As is apparent from Fig. 2, our\n2MASS sample is complete to about four magnitudes fainter than\nthe position of the dip in the luminosity function.\nThe previous pair of figures represented the combined LFs in\nthe two categories out to 0.3 R500 from the centres of only the 25\ngroups covered in the Miles et al. (2004) study, so that the K-band\nLF could be directly compared with the optical results. In the optical study, however, the number of groups studied and the area of\nsky covered in the case of each group were limited by the availability of observing time, and the size of the wide-field CCD arrays we\nhad been using.\nIn this paper, our near-IR magnitudes come from the 2MASS\nsurvey, so we can deal with the whole GEMS sample of 60 groups,\nas well as go out in radius further than the previous study. We\ndo the latter in the next section, but here in Fig. 4 we plot the J\nand K-band differential Luminosity Functions of the entire GEMS\nsample- all 60 Groups of galaxies, including those plotted in Fig. 3,\neach within a radius of 0.3R500 from their respective centres,\nstacked together to form a composite LF for the respective subclasses. There are 39 X-ray dim and 21 X-ray bright groups in this\nsample, and the total number of galaxies in either category is similar.\nAs in Fig. 3, it is clear that the LFs of the dim groups show\n\"dips\" in the LFs between \u221223 < MJ < \u221222 and \u221224 <\nMK < \u221223, thus showing that the GEMS sub-sample chosen in\nthe Miles et al. (2004) work was representative, and that the nearIR LFs are similar, irrespective of the filter used.\n\n\f4\n\nTrevor A. Miles et al.\n\nFigure 5. The K-band differential Luminosity Function of the GEMS sample, without the brightest galaxy in each group, plotted on the same scale as\nFig. 4b to allow direct comparison. The brightest two bins are diminished,\nwhilst the dipping feature found in Fig. 4 remains.\n\nOne possible reason for finding a dip feature fainter than the\nbright end of the LF of groups is that it could result from the\nfact that is most poor groups, there is one dominant galaxy, which\nwould account for an enhancement of galaxies towards the bright\nend of the LF. We examine whether this is the case of the GEMS\nLFs, by plotting in Fig. , the K-band differential Luminosity Function of all 60 groups (same as in Fig. 4b), but without the brightest\ngroup galaxies, plotted on the same scale as Fig. 4b) to allow direct\ncomparison. As expected, no galaxies remain in the brightest bin,\nand there are fewer in the second brightest, but the dip feature remains, showing that the brighest group galaxies do not account for\nthe appearance of this feature. The LFs without the central bightest\ngalaxy are similar in the other optical and near-IR filters.\n3.2 Luminosity Functions as a Function of Radius\nDifferential K-band Luminosity Functions of all X-ray dim and\nX-ray bright GEMS groups are shown in Fig. 6. The groups in\neach category are stacked together in radial bins upto 0.3 R500 , upto\n0.6 R500 and upto 1.0 R500 . It is clear that the LF of the X-ray dim\ngroups show a deficiency in the LF between \u221224 < MK < \u221223\nwithin 0.3R500 , together with a flattening in the fainter galaxies at\nmagnitudes MK > \u221222.\nFig. 7 shows in detail how dividing the sample into radial annuli, rather than the integrated average out to a certain radius as\nshown in Fig. 6, illustrates explicitly the difference in LF shape in\nthe central regions of X-ray dim groups. The dip between \u221224 <\nMK < \u221223 seen in the LF in the central regions of the groups\ngradually disappears as the LF is averaged out to larger radii, approaching R500 .\nFurthermore, when averaged out to large distances (\u223c R500 )\nfrom the centres of the groups, X-ray bright and X-ray dim groups\nhave similar LF shapes (see Fig. 6). Taking all galaxies out to R500 ,\nthe K-S test shows that it is not possible to distinguish between the\ntwo samples at the 92% confidence level.\n3.3 The slope at the faint end of the LF\nAnother feature of the LF to note in Figs. 3 and 4 is the relative\nflattening of the LF in the K-band at the faint end compared to the\nB-band, particularly in the in the cores of the X-ray dim groups\n\n(< 0.3 R500 ). One possibility is that it could result from enhanced\nrecent star formation activity being revealed in the B-band and\nnot in the JHK bands. Tidal interactions in the densest regions\nof these dynamically young groups may be responsible for preferentially inducing star formation in the less massive galaxies.\nAnother reason for the difference in faint end slope between B\nand K band data for X-ray dim groups could be the bias against low\nsurface brightness galaxies in the 2MASS catalogue, as discussed\nby the original study of galaxies in the survey (Bell et al. 2003).\nWe test this by examining the morphology of all member galaxies\nin the B image individually by eye, and classifying them as early\nor late-type. Fig 8 shows the ratio of early to late type galaxies in\nabsolute B magnitude bins, for the X-ray bright groups (solid line)\nand X-ray dim groups (dotted line).\nThis shows that at the faint end, the fraction of early-type\ngalaxies, as identified from optical images, is significantly higher\nin the X-ray bright groups. The faint end of the LF of X-ray faint\ngroups has a higher dominance of late-type galaxies than in X-ray\nbright groups. If low surface brightness late-type galaxies are systematically missed in the 2MASS survey, this would account for\nthe flattening of the LF at the faint end, compared to that in the\nB-band,\n\n4 THE MORPHOLOGICAL CONTENT OF GROUPS\nIt is important to compare our results with previous studies utilising the 2MASS catalogue. Balogh et al. (2001) use the second\nincremental release data from 2MASS to build a composite LF for\nclusters, based on 274 cluster galaxies with redshift measurements\nfrom the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. Despite the large scatter due to the small number of galaxies in their sample, they find\nbest fit values for the Schechter parameters MK\u2217 = \u221223.8 \u00b1 0.4\nand \u03b1 = \u22121.30 \u00b1 0.43 in clusters, MK\u2217 = \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.1 and\n\u03b1 = \u22121.14 \u00b1 0.26 in groups and MK\u2217 = \u221223.4 \u00b1 0.1 and\n\u03b1 = \u22121.12 \u00b1 0.21 in the field. On the other hand, Y-T Lin et al.\n(2004) use the full 2MASS data release to produce K-band LFs of\ngalaxies within 93 galaxy clusters and groups, including the three\nGEMS groups, NGC 2563, NGC 6338 and HCG 62. They found\ndifficulties fitting a single Schechter function to their data and resorted to the removal of the brightest galaxies from their fitting proceedure to produce MK\u2217 = \u221224.02 \u00b1 0.02 and \u03b1 = \u22120.84 \u00b1 0.02.\ni.e., they obtained a higher MK\u2217 than Balogh et al. (2001) and a\nflatter \u03b1 parameter.\n4.1 LFs of various morphological types\nSolutions to the problem of the inadequacy of a single Schechter\nfunction fit have been found when meeting dipping features\nin the LF of a number of structures ranging in mass from\nthe Coma (Andreon & Pell\u00f3 2000), Virgo and Fornax clusters\n(Ferguson & Sandage 1991) to Hickson groups (Hunsberger et al.\n1998) and the Leo I group (Flint, Bolte, & Mendes de Oliveira\n2003).\nAttempts have been made to explain these features as the consequence of the observed LF being just the superposition of a number of underlying LFs, each describing that of a different morphologival type of galaxies, and the variation in the LF would then just\nbe due to the variation in the relative abundances of the different\ncontributing galaxy types.\nTo test this hypothesis, we perform the following test. We start\nfrom the the B-band LF of both X-ray bright and X-ray dim groups,\n\n\fBimodal Infrared luminosity functions in galaxy groups\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. The mean differential Luminosity Functions of 25 GEMS Groups of galaxies, in the B-band (left) and K-band (right), each within a radius of\n0.3R500 from their respective centres, stacked together to form a composite LF for the respective sub-classes. These groups are the same as those described\nin Miles et al. (2004). Here X-ray bright groups (LX > 1041.7 erg s\u22121 , triangles) and X-ray dim groups (LX < 1041.7 erg s\u22121 , circles. It is clear that the\nLFs of the dim groups show \"dips\" in the LFs between \u221219 < MB < \u221217 and \u221224 < MK < \u221223.\n\nFigure 4. The near-infrared mean differential Luminosity Functions of the entire GEMS sample- all 60 Groups of galaxies, in the J-band (left) and K-band\n(right), each within a radius of 0.3R500 from their respective centres, stacked together to form a composite LF for the respective sub-classes. As in Fig. 3,\nX-ray bright groups (LX > 1041.7 erg s\u22121 are plotted as triangles, and X-ray dim groups (LX < 1041.7 erg s\u22121 ) as circles. It is clear that the LFs of the\ndim groups show \"dips\" in the LFs between \u221223 < MJ < \u221222 and \u221224 < MK < \u221223.\n\nwithin a radius of 0.3R500 , as obtained in Miles et al. (2004). We\ntreat them as a superposition of five different kinds of LFs, each\nfor a different morphological type (Ellipticals, S0s, Spirals, Dwarf\nIrregulars and Dwarf Ellipticals). We then correct each component\nLF for the B \u2212 K colour appropriate for that morphological type\nand ask whether the resultant K-band LF resembles the observed\none. If the variation of the observed LFs are solely due to a varying fraction of the different morphological types, the predicted LFs\nfound this way should match the observed ones.\nThe type-specific LFs are not neccessarily of the Schechter\nform but may take Gaussian shapes (Jerjen 1997, 2001). In the case\nof elliptical, S0 and spiral galaxies, we use Gaussian LFs, and for\nthe dwarf early and late types we use Schechter functions, following the Jerjen (2001) prescription (see Table 1).\n\nTable 1.

The three plots in each case go out to 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 times R500\nrespectively. The intermediate luminosity dip feature is more prominent in the inner regions of the X-ray dim groups. The LF of the X-ray bright groups\nremains similar in shape at all radii.\n\nFigure 7. As in the previous figure, but in differential radial bins.

The MCMC algorithm (e.g., Lewis & Bridle 2002) is a\ncomputationally efficient way to map the likelihood of the fit to the\ndata in the high-dimensional parameter space of the five LF components. The MCMC algorithm was used to draw samples with a\nnumber density asymptotically proportional to the probability density representing the likelihood of the fit. In this way, the shape of\nthe full posterior probability density (using a uniform prior) was explored while avoiding excessive processor time in low-probability\nregions of the fit-space.\nThe MCMC algorithm selected new points in the fit-space by\nsimultaneously jumping along all the parameters representing the\nfive LF components. The size of this jump was always a random\nfraction of a characteristic step-size along each parameter. The chi-\n\nTable 2.

The process was then repeated, jumping\nagain from the most recently accepted point in the fit-space. The\n\n\fBimodal Infrared luminosity functions in galaxy groups\n\n7\n\nthus determined, is shown in Fig. 11, and compared with the relative abundances predicted by the LF fits in the previous section.\nThe component LF-fitting process predicts the presence of\nlarge numbers of dwarf irregulars in the B-band (Fig. 9, dotted\nline), which seems to be is a reasonable fit to the data (Fig. 9b (dotted line); Fig. 11b, dotted line). However, the model fails to fit the\ndwarf elliptical population (dot-dot-dot-dashed line), underestimating the observed frequency in Fig. 11a. The spiral galaxy population is missed entirely by the models (Fig. 11b, dash-dot-dot-dot\nline). The predicted early-type population (elliptical and lenticulars) matches the observed data better than the late-type curve but\nalso fails to pass through any data point within error bars.\nThe apparent failure of the component morphology-based LF\ncurves to fit real data indicates that the galaxy population in groups\nof galaxies has a different morphological mix from that of clusters\nand in the field. Evolutionary processes are most favoured in groups\nand may be responsible for the differences in galaxy populations\nobserved.\nFigure 8. The ratio of early to late type galaxies (where morphology is\nassigned by visual inspection from optical CCD images), divided into Xray bright (LX > 1041.7 erg s\u22121 ) and X-ray dim (LX < 1041.7 erg s\u22121 )\ngroups. The relative abundance dominance of late-type dwarf galaxies in\nthe X-ray dim groups may account for the flattening of the faint end of\ntheir near-IR luminosity function, if low surface brightness objects are being\nsystematically missed in the 2MASS survey.\n\nnumber of accepted points was optimised by adjusting the stepsize along each component. Excessively large step sizes meant that\nvery few new points were accepted, and overly small step sizes restricted exploration around the fit-space. The algorithm had clearly\ndetermined a best-fit curve from the five components after 107 iterations.\nFig. 9a shows the results of the fitting procedure, plotted superposed on the observed B-band data, for the X-ray dim groups.\nThe best-fit component LFs were corrected by the colour appropriate for the particular morphological type using the typical B \u2212 K\ncolours for each morphological type, as given in Jarrett et al. (2003)\nand shown in Table 2, and the predicted composite K-band luminosity function is shown in Fig. 9b. Superposed on these are the\nobserved LFs.\nIt is obvious that this procedure would not work if it is required\nto fit both the B and K band LFs simultaneously. The K-band\nLFs produced from the B-band observed data do not have the same\nfeatures as the observed K-band LFs. In order to find a good match\nto the observed K-band LFs, one expects the B-band LF to be\ndominated almost exclusively by ellipticals and S0s brighter than\n\u221218, and the number of spirals to be insignificant.\nFor the X-ray bright groups, shown in Fig. 10, early types\ndominate the brighter end, and again there are very few spirals\nbrighter than \u221218, contrary to what is observed.\n\n4.2 Comparison with visually verified morphological content\nWe can go one step further and check the morphological composition of these groups from our visual inspection of galaxy images in\nthe X-ray dim groups.\nThe visual classification used here is the same as that used in\nMiles et al. (2004), further details may be found therein. A simple\nclassification system was adopted whereby each galaxy was classified as early- or late-type based on inspecting the B-band optical\nCCD image. The relative content of early and late type galaxies,\n\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe main problems associated with Luminosity Functions at optical wavelengths are that they are liable to be affected by dust extinction as well as by young stellar populations, thus rendering the\nlight less representative of the underlying matter. This is far less of\na problem in the near-infrared, where one is more likely to trace\nthe more evolved stellar populations and hence the actual stellar\ncontent of galaxies. Near-infrared luminosities are more directly\nrelated to stellar mass, constraining both the history of the star formation and galaxy formation models. The fact that we find dip features in the luminosity functions of X-ray dim groups of galaxies\nin the near-infrared regime means that it is unlikely that star formation or dust extinction is responsible for the observed depletion of\nintermediate magnitude galaxies.\nSuch features have often been explained as the result of the\nrepresentation in the total galaxy luminosity function of the underlying morphological makeup of groups. Invariant type-specific LFs\nhave been claimed (e.g., Jerjen 2001). Implicit in this notion is the\nassumption of passive evolution at all structure scales, and thus the\nshape of the LF is merely due to the combination of the individual\nLFs of galaxies of different morphological types in varying proportions. The deviation from these functional forms may therefore provide evidence of predominant major mergers affecting this model,\nand bringing into question the invariance of the LFs of individual\nmorphological types.\nFig. 11 shows the observed luminosity function of galaxies\nvisually classified as early and late types. The superposed curves\nare the results from the earlier fitting process, clearly showing that\nthe comparison with real data does not work when one assumes\nuniversal luminosity functions for different morphological types.\nThis view subscribes to the notion of passive evolution i.e., an\ninitial distribution of galaxy types was imprinted in the early Universe and very little has occurred by way of galaxy transformational\nprocesses (such as major or minor galaxy mergers, ram pressure\nstripping, and harrassment) to affect this makeup. This view falters\nwhen confronted with the high incidence of early-type galaxies in\nthe relatively shallow potential wells of groups.\nWe argued in Miles et al. (2004) that the persistent depletion\nof the intermediate-luminosity galaxies in the optical luminosity\nfunctions of X-ray dim groups shows that in the dynamically sluggish environment of such groups (which have low velocity disperi-\n\n\f8\n\nTrevor A.

In this\nwork, we have shown that this effect is also seen in the near-infrared\nLFs, but only in the interior regions of the groups (R < 0.3 R500 ),\nas in the case of the optical LFs. We also show that this effect vanishes when one goes out to R500 , an effect we had not tested in our\noptical CCD data due to lack of coverage. We thus show that the\nintermediate depletion in the LFs is a real feature, and we argue\nthat it is due to the merging of galaxies, rather than a bright-end\nenhancement caused by excess star formation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThanks to Trevor Ponman for interesting discussions and suggestions, and, together with John Osmond, for their work on the X-ray\nproperties of the GEMS sample, and to Duncan Forbes and all our\ncollaborators in the multi-wavelength GEMS project.
