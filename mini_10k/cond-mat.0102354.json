We\nmention from the beginning that these observations are not to defend our\npaper but to make more clear the problem from our paper which is not the\nsame with the new points of the authors. However, we mention that indeed\nCV \u223c T ln T has been obtained first by Millis [3] for the marginal case z = d\n(recently it was showed [4] that it could also appear near a Lifshits point),\nbut in this case we belive that it is given by the presence in the theory of\nthe dangerous irrelevant parameter which leads to the logarithmic correction\nas was mentioned recently by Belitz et al.[5] on the basis of scaling analysis.\nBefore considering the specific feature of our model and calculations we will\nstart with a short analysis of the experimental results, and the theoretical\nmodels proposed in literature for the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the\nitinerant-electron ferromagnetism.\nA. A short review of experimental data and the phenomenological approach\nIt is well known that that quantum phase transitions in clean itinerantelectron ferromagnet (we will use clean and disordered in the same sense as\nKirkpatrick and Belitz [5] and Vojta [6]) appear in a small number of systems\n(if we refer to the antiferromagnetic QPT) as MnSi or T h1\u2212x Ux Cu2 Si2 and\nthis transition is given by doping or preassure. One of the most remarcable\n1\n\n\fproperty of these materials is the non-Fermi behavior of the transport and\nmagnetic properties. Pfleiderer et al. [7] formulated a phenomenological\nMoryia-like model for the explanation of the non-Fermi behavior of MnSi,\nthe main point being the state d = z = 3 which is a non-Fermi liquid. This is\nin agreement with the Millis [3] analysis from Renormalization Group (RG)\ncalculation, and called marginal case.\nB. Renormalization Group approaches\nThe first way to use the Renormalization Group (RG) method , due to\nHertz [10] was reconsidered by Millis [3] and recently by Lavagna [11] and\nused for the clean itinerant-electron paramagnetic phase. The susceptibility\n\u03c7(~q, \u03c9) given by Lindhard function arround q = \u03c9 = 0 is written as:\nq\n\u03c7 (~q, \u03c9) = \u03c7 (0, 0) \u2212 b\nkF\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121\n\n\u00132\n\n+ ia\n\n\u03c9\nqvF\n\n(1)\n\nThe imaginary term can be written as \u03c9/\u0393(q), where limq\u21920 \u0393(q) = 0, because the fluctuations of the order parameter in ferromagnetic order satisfies\nthe conservation law. The RG theory is developed using a \u03c64 -model for the\nfluctuations of the order parameter, and for def f = d + z > 4 the interaction\nbecomes an irrelevant parameter which leads to a Gaussian model. Studing\nthe crossover from quantum to classical behavior it was showed (see Ref.[3,4])\nthat in the specific heat the T ln T is given by the quantum contribution.\nThe second point of view was recently pointed out by Belitz, Kirkpatrick\nand Vojta (BKV) in a relevant number of papers [5,6] (the starting papers\nare cited in these references) who showed the non-analyticity of \u03c7(~q, \u03c9) and\nfor d = 3, and at finite temperature we have:\n\u22121\n\n\u03c7 (~q, \u03c9) = \u03b4 + c3\n\n\u0012\n\nq\n2kF\n\n\u00132\n\nln\n\n|\u03c9|\n2kF\n+ c2 q 2 +\nq\n\u0393(~q)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393(~q) \u223c q. This form gives a first order phase transition and leads to\nthe non-analyticity of the Landau-Ginsburg theory that is given by the singular behavior of the coefficients of this expansion. This singular behavior is\ndue to the integrating out of the soft mode which is in this case particle-hole\nexcitations mode. In fact this appear when \u03c7(~q, \u03c9) is calculate using a linear\ndispersion for the electron-hole excitations. The Lindhard function \u03c7(~q, \u03c9)\n2\n\n\fis calculated using the Green functions with quadratic wave vector dependence. Recently, the authors [12] developed a local field theory (a theory\nwith a definite Landau-Ginsburg action when q \u2192 0, \u03c9 \u2192 0) and for a disordered ferromagnet, keeping the soft modes which in this case are diffusive.\nThe logarithmic correction to the scaling was presented as due to the Wegner corrections. The problem of the clean itinerant-electron ferromagnetic\ntransition was not treated using the local field theory, but it seems to us that\na similar RG treatment can be done.\nC. Model proposed in our paper [2]\nOur paper started from a very special class of systems Fx P d1\u2212x (where\nF is a ferromagnetic impurity, and x is the concentration) first studied by\nDoniach and Wohlfarth [8] and recently by Nicklas et al.[9] which showed that\nsuch a system becomes non-Fermi. These systems are very different from the\nsystems mentioned above because P d is a paramagnetic metal which is close\nto the Stoner instability and a small concentration of magnetic impurities\ndrive this metal in a ferromagnetic state, but near a critical concentration\nassociated with the quantum phase transition this system becomes also nonFermi. This behavior is difficult to be explained in terms of disorder, and we\nadopted the idea from Ref.8, that a strong polarization of the Fermi liquid\ncouples to the fluctuations of the magnetic impurities. The susceptibility of\nthis system has the form:\n\u03c7\u22121 (~q, \u03c9) = \u03b4 \u2212 aq 2 \u2212 b\n\n\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2212i\n2\nq\n\u0393*q\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the concentration dependent distance from the quantum critical\npoint. Starting with these considerations we will discuss the possible theoretical models which can give for the specific heat a T ln T behavior, which\ndemonstrate the non-Fermi character of the system. First we have to define\nthe fluctuations of magnetic impurities. Certainly this is not a critical mode\nand have a strong local character. This gives a very special form for \u03c7(~q, \u03c9)\napproximated by Eq.(3), which for \u2206 = 0 gives the behavior similar with\nEq.(1). This equation is different from Eq.(2) because of the absence of a\n(q/2kF )2 ln(2kF /q) term in the BKV model. On the other hand we mention that due to the electron-spin coupling we cannot integrate out the soft\nmode (electron-hole mode) and this is the explanation why Eq.(3) is similar\n3\n\n\fto Eq.(1), if \u2206 = 0. \u00bfFrom the RG scaling equation we have to get \u2206 6= 0\na relevant parameter, and \u0393 = const. This can be obtained if z < 4 and\nz = 3. This is specific for the studied system and gives to u (interaction)\nthe character of dangerous irrelevant parameter. A sistem with z = 2 still\nkeep valid the condition def f = d + z > 0 which can give a T ln T in the specific heat. It is easy to see that this behavior is associated with the specific\nmodel defined by Eq.(3), which will never contain a non-analytic contribution because we used the Lindhard form for \u03c7(~q, \u03c9) of the electrons. Finally,\nwe mention that even for a more eleborated model, the non-Fermi behavior,\nmentioned in fact by Belitz et al.[14], have to be reobtained for the QPT in\nthe itinerant-electron systems in d = 3.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.Belitz, T.R.Kirkpatrick, cond-mat/0102064\n[2] I.Grosu, D.Bodea, M.Crisan, cond-mat/0101392\n[3] A.J.Millis, Phys.Rev.B 48, 7183, (1993)\n[4] C.P.Moca, I.Tifrea, M.Crisan, Phys.Rev.B 61, 3247, (2000)\n[5] T.R.Kirkpatrick, D.Belitz, cond-mat/9707001 (see also the references\ntherein concerning this problem obtained by Belitz, Kirkpatrick, Vojta\n(BKV))\n[6] T.Vojta, Ann.Phys.(2000) (to be published)\n[7] C.Pfleiderer, G.J.McMullan, S.R.Julian, G.G.Lonzarich, Phys.Rev.B\n55, 8330, (1997)\n[8] S.Doniach, E.P.Wohlfarth, Proc.Royal.Soc.(London) 296, 442, (1967)\n[9] M.Nicklas, M.Bredo, G.Kenbel, F.Mayr, W.Trinke, A.Ladl, Phys.Rev.Lett.\n82, 4286, (1999)\n[10] J.A.Hertz, Phys.Rev.B 14, 1165, (1976)\n[11] M.Lavagna, cond-mat/0102119\n[12] D.Belitz, T.R.Kirkpatrick, M.T.Mercaldo, S.L.Session, cond-mat/0008061\n[13] D.Belitz, T.R.Kirkpatrick, M.T.Mercaldo, S.L.Session, cond-mat/0010377\n[14] D.Belitz, T.R.Kirkpatrick, R.Narayanan, T.Vojta, Phys.Rev.Lett.85,\n4602, (2000)\n\n4\n\n\f"}
