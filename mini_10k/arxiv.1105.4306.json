We show that\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between oscillating m-rim hook tableaux and m-colored\nmatchings. The construction of our bijection relies on the generalized Schensted algorithm for\nrim hook tableaux introduced by White [8].\nWe shall pay special attention to the case of oscillating domino (2-rim hook) tableaux with\nat most two columns. In this case, our main result reduces to a bijection between oscillating\ndomino tableaux with at most two columns and noncrossing 2-colored matchings. Bear in mind\nthat, a noncrossing 2-colored matching is not meant to be a noncrossing matching with two\ncolors, but a matching that does not contain crossing edges that are of the same color. On the\nother hand, we find a correspondence between oscillating domino tableaux with at most two\ncolumns and Dyck path packings. A Dyck path packing can be viewed as a dispersed Dyck path\n1\n\n\fE weakly covered by a Dyck path D, where a dispersed Dyck path is defined as non-overlapping\nDyck paths connected by some horizontal steps on the x-axis. See Figure 1.1 for an illustration.\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nFigure 1.1: A Dyck path packing.\nSo we are led to a bijection between Dyck path packings and noncrossing 2-colored matchings.\nIt is easy to check that noncrossing 2-colored matchings with 2n vertices are counted by the\nproduct of two Catalan numbers, that is, Cn Cn+1 , where\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n2n\nCn =\n.\nn+1 n\nNotice that there are several combinatorial objects that are enumerated by the number\nCn Cn+1 , such as walks within the first quadrant of Z3 starting at (0, 0, 0) and consisting of\nn steps taken from {(\u22121, 0, 0), (0, \u22121, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, \u22121)}, see Bostan and Kauers [1], walks\nwithin the first quadrant of Z2 starting at (0, 0), ending on the x-axis and consisting of 2n steps\ntaken from {(\u22121, 0), (\u22121, 1), (1, \u22121), (1, 0)}, see Bousquet-M\u00e9lou and Mishna [2], alternating\nBaxter permutations of length 2n + 1, see Cori, Dulucq and Viennot [4], and walks within\nthe first quadrant of Z2 starting and ending at (0, 0) and consisting of 2n steps taken from\n{(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121), (0, 1), (1, 0)}, see Guy [5]. We also find a correspondence between noncrossing\n2-colored matchings and Guy's walks. It would be interesting to establish further connections\nbetween packings of Dyck paths and other combinatorial structures.\nLet us give an overview of some definitions. A partition of an integer n is a sequence\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbl ) of nonincreasing positive integers such that \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + * * * + \u03bbl = n. We can also\nrepresent a partition by its Young diagram, i.e., a left-justified array of cells (or, squares) with\n\u03bbi cells in row i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. For example, Figure 1.2 is the Young diagram of the partition\n(5, 4, 2, 2).\n\nFigure 1.2: The Young diagram of (5, 4, 2, 2)\nTo define the rim hooks of a partition, we note that the outside border of a partition \u03bb is a\ncollection of cells not in \u03bb but immediately bellow or to the right of \u03bb; or in the first row and to\n2\n\n\fthe right of \u03bb; or in the first column and bellow \u03bb. For example, in Figure 1.3 the shaded area\nillustrates the outside border of \u03bb = (5, 4, 2, 2).\n***\n\n..\n.\nFigure 1.3: The outside border of (5, 4, 2, 2)\nLet \u03b1 be a set of contiguous cells in the outside border of \u03bb. We say that \u03b1 is a rim hook\noutside \u03bb if the shape \u03bc = \u03bb \u222a \u03b1 is the Young diagram of a partition. For example, in Figure 1.4,\nit can be seen that among the three sets of contiguous cells in the outside border of \u03bb, there is\nonly one rim hook outside \u03bb, which is the third diagram. If \u03b1 has m cells, then we write |\u03b1| = m\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 1.4: Contiguous cells in the outside border\nand call \u03b1 an m-rim hook outside \u03bb. If \u03b1 is a rim hook outside \u03bb and \u03bc = \u03bb \u222a \u03b1, then we call \u03b1\nan outer rim hook of \u03bc, and we write \u03bc \u2212 \u03b1 to mean \u03bb.\nWe can now introduce the notion of oscillating m-rim hook tableaux. An oscillating m-rim\nhook tableau of length 2n can be defined as a sequence \u03bb = (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2n ) of Young diagrams\nsuch that \u03bb0 = \u03bb2n = \u2205, and for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, \u03bbi is obtained from \u03bbi\u22121 either by adding an m-rim\nhook outside \u03bbi\u22121 or by deleting an outer m-rim hook of \u03bbi\u22121 . For example, Figure 1.5 is an\nillustration of an oscillating 3-rim hook tableau.\n\u2205\n\n\u2205\n\nFigure 1.5: An oscillating 3-rim hook tableau\nWhen m = 1, an oscillating m-rim hook tableau is an ordinary oscillating tableau. An\n3\n\n\foscillating 2-rim hook tableau will be also called an oscillating domino tableau. We shall use\nr(\u03bb) (resp., c(\u03bb)) to denote the maximum number of rows (resp., columns) of the shape \u03bbi\nappearing in \u03bb for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2n.\nThe main objective of this paper is to show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between\noscillating m-rim hook tableaux and m-colored matchings. An m-colored matching M on [2n]\nis a matching on [2n] with each arc assigned one of m colors, say, c1 , c2 , . . . , cm . For example,\nFigure 1.6 gives a 2-colored matching, where we use solid lines to represent arcs assigned the\ncolor c1 , and dotted lines to represent arcs assigned the color c2 . A k-crossing of M is a k-subset\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nFigure 1.6: A 2-colored matching\n{(i1 , j1 ), (i2 , j2 ), . . . , (ik , jk )} of arcs of the same color such that i1 < i2 < * * * < ik < j1 < j2 <\n* * * < jk . Similarly, we define a k-nesting of M as a k-subset {(i1 , j1 ), (i2 , j2 ), . . . , (ik , jk )} of\narcs of the same color such that i1 < i2 < * * * < ik < jk < * * * < j2 < j1 . Denote by cr(M )\n(resp., ne(M )) the maximal number k such that M has a k-crossing (resp., k-nesting). We\nsay that M is k-noncrossing (resp., k-nonnesting) if M has no k-crossing (resp., k-nesting). A\n2-noncrossing (or, 2-nonnesting) m-colored matching is called a noncrossing (or, nonnesting)\nm-colored matching.\nOur bijection can be used to characterize the crossing number and the nesting number of an\nm-colored matching in terms of the maximum number of columns and the maximum number\nof rows of shapes in the corresponding oscillating m-rim hook tableau. The construction of our\nbijection is based on the generalized Schensted algorithm for rim hook tableaux due to White\n[8].\nThis paper is organized as follows. We shall give a brief review of White's algorithm in\nSection 2. Based on this algorithm, we give a description of the bijection between oscillating mrim hook tableaux and m-colored matchings in Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with oscillating\ndomino tableaux with at most two columns and noncrossing 2-colored matchings. We show\nthat such tableaux are in one-to-one correspondence with Dyck path packings. We also give a\nbijection between noncrossing 2-colored matchings and Guy's walks.\n\n2\n\nThe generalized Schensted algorithm\n\nTo give a combinatorial proof of the orthogonality of the characters of the symmetric group Sn ,\nWhite [8] extended the ordinary Schensted algorithm [6] to rim hook tableaux. For our purpose,\nwe shall be concerned with only a special case of White's construction when all rim hooks and\nhooks are restricted to m-rim hooks and m-hooks. This version of White's algorithm has been\nfurther studied by Stanton and White [7]. As remarked by White [8], when m = 2, White's\n4\n\n\falgorithm reduces to a one-to-one correspondence between elements of the hyperoctahedral group\nand pairs of domino tableaux of the same shape, which was first obtained by Lusztig. We shall\nadopt the notation and terminology in [7].\nFor two partitions \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . .) and \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . .), we write \u03bc \u2286 \u03bb if \u03bci \u2264 \u03bbi for all i.\nIf \u03bc \u2286 \u03bb, then the skew diagram of shape \u03bb/\u03bc is defined as the set of cells obtained from \u03bb by\ndeleting the cells in \u03bc. For example, the shaded area in Figure 2.1 represents a skew diagram.\n\nFigure 2.1: The skew diagram of shape (5, 4, 2, 2)/(3, 2, 1)\nLet i1 , i2 , . . . , in be n positive integers with i1 < i2 < * * * < in . An m-rim hook tableau\nP of shape \u03bb on {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } is an assignment of i1 , i2 , . . . , in to the squares of \u03bb with each\ninteger appearing exactly m times such that the set \u03b1 of squares occupied by in is an outer\nm-rim hook of \u03bb, and the tableau obtained from P by deleting the squares occupied by in is an\nm-rim hook tableau on {i1 , i2 , . . . , in\u22121 }. We say that i1 , i2 , . . . , in are the contents of P , and\nwrite content(P ) = {i1 , i2 , . . . , in }. Similarly, we can define skew m-rim hook tableaux of shape\n\u03bb/\u03bc. Figure 2.2 is an illustration of a 4-rim hook tableau.\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n1\n3\n3\n3\n5\n\n1 1 4 4\n3 4 4\n5\n5\n5\n\nFigure 2.2: A 4-rim hook tableau\nRecall that an m-hook is the Young diagram corresponding to a partition (t, 1, 1, . . . , 1) of\nm, where 1 \u2264 t \u2264 m. An m-hook tableau is an m-rim hook tableau whose shape is an m-hook.\nFigure 2.3 gives a 4-hook tableau of shape (2, 1, 1).\n3 3\n3\n3\nFigure 2.3: A 4-hook tableau\nLet P be an m-rim hook tableau, and H be an m-hook tableau. The generalized Schensted\nalgorithm is an algorithm to generate an m-rim hook tableau by inserting H to P . When m = 1,\nit reduces to the usual Schensted algorithm. To describe the generalized Schensted algorithm,\nwe need recall more definitions.\n5\n\n\fLet \u03b1 be a set of contiguous cells contained in the outside border of \u03bb. The head (resp., tail)\nof \u03b1 is the upper rightmost (resp., lower leftmost) square in \u03b1. The head (resp., tail) of \u03b1 is\nsaid to be illegal with respect to \u03bb if the cell above (resp., to the left) the head (resp., tail) is\nin the outside border of \u03bb. For example, in Figure 1.4 the contiguous cells in (1) have an illegal\nhead, whereas the contiguous cells in (2) have an illegal tail. Clearly, if \u03b1 has neither an illegal\nhead nor an illegal tail with respect to \u03bb, then \u03b1 is a rim hook outside \u03bb. Even though \u03b1 is not\na rim hook outside \u03bb, it may be a rim hook outside another partition. We shall say that \u03b1 is a\nrim hook if it is a rim hook outside a certain partition.\nLet \u03c3 be a rim hook contained in the outside border of \u03bb. Let slitherup(\u03bb, \u03c3) denote the rim\nhook contained in the outside border of \u03bb, whose tail is adjacent to the head of \u03c3. Similarly, we\ncan define slitherdown(\u03bb, \u03c3). Figure 2.4 gives illustrations of these two operations.\n\nslitherup(\u03bb, \u03c3)\n\n\u03c3\n\nslitherdown(\u03bb, \u03c3)\n\nFigure 2.4: slitherup(\u03bb, \u03c3) and slitherdown(\u03bb, \u03c3)\nIf \u03b1 is a collection of cells which are not necessarily contiguous, then bumpout(\u03b1) is the\ncollection of cells directly bellow and to the right of a single cell in \u03b1. If \u03c3 and \u03c4 are two distinct\nrim hooks outside \u03bb such that \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 6= \u2205, then define \u03c3[\u03c4 ] as a rim hook outside \u03bb \u222a \u03c4 , that is,\n\u03c3[\u03c4 ] = (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 ) \u222a bumpout(\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 ).\nSee Figure 2.5 for an illustration.\n\n\u03c3\u2212\u03c3\u2229\u03c4\n\n\u03c3\u2229\u03c4\n\nbumpout(\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 )\n\nFigure 2.5: \u03c3[\u03c4 ]\nLet U be an m-rim hook tableau of shape \u03bb, and V a skew m-rim hook tableau of shape\n\u03bc/\u03c9. The pair (U, V ) is called an overlapping pair if \u03c3 = \u03bb/\u03c9 is a rim hook outside \u03c9, and any\ncontent in U is smaller than any content in V .\nGiven an overlapping pair (U, V ), Stanton and White [7] defined an operator A acting on\nthe pair (U, V ), which generates an overlapping pair (U 1 , V 1 ) = A(U, V ). To be precise, the\noperator A can be described as follows. Suppose that r is the minimum content in V , and \u03c4\n6\n\n\fis the m-rim hook containing r. For a rim hook \u03b1 and an integer s, let \u03b1(s) denote the rim\nkook \u03b1 with each cell of \u03b1 filled with s. The skew m-rim hook tableau V 1 is obtained from V\nby removing \u03c4 (r). Then U 1 can be constructed depending on how the shapes \u03c3 and \u03c4 overlap.\nNote that \u03c3 = \u03bb/\u03c9, where \u03bb is the shape of U and \u03bc/\u03c9 is the shape of V . There are three cases.\nCase 1: \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 = \u2205. Set U 1 = U \u222a \u03c4 (r).\nCase 2: \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 6= \u2205 and \u03c3 6= \u03c4 . Set U 1 = U \u222a \u03c4 [\u03c3](r).\nCase 3: \u03c3 = \u03c4 . In this case, we construct a sequence (\u03c4 = \u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . .) of m-rim hooks\ncontained in the outside border of \u03bb, where \u03c4i = slitherup(\u03bb, \u03c4i\u22121 ) for i \u2265 1. Assume that m0 is\nthe smallest integer such that the head of \u03c4m0 is legal with respect to \u03bb. Set U 1 = U \u222a \u03c4m0 (r).\nIt is not difficult to check that A(U, V ) is an overlapping pair, see [8]. Let\nAn (U, V ) = An\u22121 (A(U, V )),\nand write\n(U n , V n ) = An (U, V ).\nAssume that n0 is the smallest integer such that V n0 is empty. Then, define\nCombine(U, V ) = U n0 .\nWe can now state the rim hook insertion algorithm. Suppose that P is an m-rim hook\ntableau of shape \u03bb with contents not containing r, and H is an m-hook tableau with content r.\nThe rim hook insertion algorithm gives an m-rim hook tableau by inserting H to P , denoted\nP \u2190 H. To obtain P \u2190 H, we need to define an overlapping pair (U, V ). Let P = P1 \u222a P2 ,\nwhere P1 (resp., P2 ) is the m-rim hook tableau contained in P with contents smaller than (resp.,\ngreater than) r. We set V = P2 .\nTo define U , we assume that \u03c4 is the shape of H, and \u03bb\u2032 is the shape of P1 . Let (\u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . .)\nbe a sequence of m-rim hooks, where \u03c40 = \u03c4 and \u03c4i = slitherup(\u2205, \u03c4i\u22121 ) for i \u2265 1. Moreover, we\nassume that m0 is the smallest integer such that \u03c4m0 has no intersection with \u03bb\u2032 . We still need\nanother sequence (\u03c30 , \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . .) of m-rim hooks contained in the outside border of \u03bb\u2032 , where\n\u03c30 = \u03c4m0 and \u03c3i = slitherup(\u03bb\u2032 , \u03c3i\u22121 ) for i \u2265 1. Assume that n0 is the smallest integer such\nthat \u03c3n0 has a legal head with respect to \u03bb\u2032 . Then U is set to be P1 \u222a \u03c4 (r).\nBased on the m-rim hook tableaux U and V , the m-rim hook tableau P \u2190 H can be defined\nas Combine(U, V ). It can be shown that the above rim hook insertion algorithm is invertible,\nsee [8].\nThe rim hook insertion algorithm leads to a one-to-one correspondence between m-hook\npermutations and pairs of m-rim hook tableaux of the same shape. Let i1 , i2 , . . . , in be n positive\nintegers with i1 < i2 < * * * < in . An m-hook permutation on {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } is a permutation of\nn m-hook tableaux such that the contents of these m-hook tableaux read off from left to right\nform a permutation on {i1 , i2 , . . . , in }. For example, Figure 2.6 illustrates a 4-hook permutation\non {1, 4, 6, 9}.\nAs remarked in [7], an m-hook permutation on [n] can be viewed as an element of the\nwreath product Cm \u2240 Sn , where Cm is the cyclic group of order m, or equivalently, as an mcolored permutation on [n] in the sense that each element in the permutation is assigned one of\nthe colors c1 , c2 , . . . , cm .\n7\n\n\f6 6\n6\n6\n\n4 4 4\n4\n\n9 9 9 9\n\n1 1 1\n1\n\nFigure 2.6: A 4-hook permutation\nGiven an m-hook permutation H = H1 H2 * * * Hn , one can construct an m-rim hook tableaux\nP = (* * * ((\u2205 \u2190 H1 ) \u2190 H2 ) \u2190 * * * ) \u2190 Hn by inserting H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn one after another, see [7]\nfor details. We call P the insertion tableau of H.\nTheorem 2.1 (Stanton and White [7]) There is a bijection Sch between m-hook permutations\non {1, 2, . . . , n} and all pairs of m-rim hook tableaux of the same shape with content {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nThe bijection Sch in Theorem 2.1 inherits many important properties of the ordinary Schensted correspondence. For our purpose, we need the property on the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences in an m-hook permutation. An increasing subsequence in an mhook permutation H = H1 H1 * * * Hn is a subsequence Hi1 Hi2 * * * His such that Hi1 , Hi2 , . . . , His\nare of the same shape and content(Hi1 ) < content(Hi2 ) < * * * < content(His ). A decreasing\nsubsequence in H can be defined analogously. The following theorem is due to Stanton and\nWhite [7], where \u2308x\u2309 is the usual ceiling function meaning the smallest integer greater than or\nequal to x.\nTheorem 2.2 Let H be an m-hook permutation, and let P be the insertion tableau of H. Suppose that P has r rows and c columns. Then the length of the longest increasing (resp., decreasing) subsequence in H is \u2308r/m\u2309 (resp., \u2308c/m\u2309).\nThe following proposition will be used in the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nProposition 2.3 Let H = H1 * * * Hr * * * Hn be an m-hook permutation with Hr containing the\nmaximum content, and let \u0124 = H1 * * * \u0124r * * * Hn be the m-hook permutation obtained from H by\ndeleting Hr . Suppose that P1 (resp., P2 ) is the insertion tableau of H (resp., \u0124). Then P2 is\nthe tableau obtained from P1 by removing the m-rim hook filled with the maximum content.\n\n3\n\nOscillating rim hook tableaux\n\nIn this section, we present a bijection between oscillating m-rim hook tableaux and m-colored\nmatchings. Recall that for an oscillating m-rim hook tableaux \u03bb, r(\u03bb) (resp., c(\u03bb)) is the\nmaximum number of rows (resp., columns) of shapes appearing in \u03bb.\nTheorem 3.1 There is a bijection \u03c6 between oscillating m-rim hook tableaux of length 2n and\nm-colored matchings on [2n]. Moreover, for any oscillating m-rim hook tableau \u03bb we have\n\u2308r(\u03bb)/m\u2309 = ne(\u03c6(\u03bb))\n8\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fand\n\u2308c(\u03bb)/m\u2309 = cr(\u03c6(\u03bb)).\n\n(3.2)\n\nProof. We first describe the bijection \u03c6 from oscillating m-rim hook tableaux of length 2n to\nm-colored matchings on [2n]. Let\n\u03bb = (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2n )\nbe an oscillating m-rim hook tableau. We shall recursively define a sequence\n(M0 , T0 ), (M1 , T1 ), . . . , (M2n , T2n ),\nwhere Mi is a set of m-colored arcs, and Ti is an m-rim hook tableau of shape \u03bbi . Let M0 be the\nempty set, and let T0 be the empty tableau. To obtain (Mi , Ti ) for i \u2265 1, we have the following\ntwo cases.\nCase 1: \u03bbi is obtained from \u03bbi\u22121 by adding an m-rim hook outside \u03bbi\u22121 . In this case, let\nMi = Mi\u22121 and let Ti be the m-rim hook tableau obtained from Ti\u22121 by filling the m-rim hook\n\u03bbi /\u03bbi\u22121 with the element i.\nCase 2: \u03bbi is obtained from \u03bbi\u22121 by deleting an outer m-rim hook of \u03bbi\u22121 . In this case, let Ti\nbe the m-rim hook tableau of shape \u03bbi such that Ti\u22121 is obtained from Ti by inserting an m-hook\ntableau H. Note that H is uniquely determined since the generalized Schensted algorithm is\ninvertible. Suppose that H has shape (t, 1, 1, . . . , 1) and content(H) = {j}. It is easy to see\nthat j < i. Let Mi be the set obtained from Mi\u22121 by adding an arc (j, i) colored with ct .\nFrom the above construction, it is easy to check that M2n is an m-colored matching on [2n].\nWe set \u03c6(\u03bb) = M2n .\nThe reverse map \u03c8, from m-colored matchings to oscillating m-rim hook tableaux, can be\ndescribed as follows. Let M be an m-colored matching on [2n]. We shall construct a sequence\nT (M ) = (T0 , T1 , . . . , T2n ) of m-rim hook tableaux by a recursive procedure.\nLet T2n be the empty tableau. For j \u2264 2n \u2212 1, Tj can be constructed based on the following\ntwo cases.\nCase 1: j + 1 is the right-hand endpoint of an arc (i, j + 1) colored with ct . In this case, let Tj be\nthe m-rim hook tableau obtained from Tj+1 by inserting an m-hook tableau of shape (t, 1, . . . , 1)\nfilled with i.\nCase 2: j + 1 is the left-hand endpoint of an arc (j + 1, k). Note that in this case j + 1 is the\nlargest content of Tj+1 . Let Tj be the m-rim hook tableau obtained from Tj+1 by deleting the\nm-rim hook filled with j + 1.\nSet \u03bb = (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2n ), where \u03bbi is the shape of Ti . From the above procedure, it can be\nseen that \u03bb is an oscillating m-rim hook tableau. Define \u03c8(M ) = \u03bb. It is not hard to check that\n\u03c8 is the reverse map of \u03c6.\nIt remains to prove the relations (3.1) and (3.2). For a m-colored matching M , let T (M ) =\n(T0 , T1 , . . . , T2n ) be the sequence of m-rim hook tableaux constructed from M . We now give a\nrecursive procedure to generate a sequence of m-hook permutations (H1 , H2 , . . . , H2n ) from the\nsequence T (M ) of m-rim hook tableaux. Let H2n be the empty hook permutation. Suppose that\n9\n\n\fthe m-hook permutation Hi has been constructed. To generate Hi\u22121 , we consider the following\ntwo cases.\nCase 1: Ti\u22121 is obtained from Ti by inserting an m-Hook tableau Hj . In this case, let Hi\u22121 =\nHi H j .\nCase 2: Ti is obtained from Ti\u22121 by adding an m-rim hook filled with i. In this case, let Hi\u22121\nbe the hook permutation obtained from Hi by deleting the m-hook tableau with content i.\nWe claim that Ti is the insertion tableau of Hi . This can be shown by induction. Clearly,\nthe claim holds for i = 2n. Suppose that it is true for i, where 1 < i \u2264 2n. We shall show\nthat the claim holds for i \u2212 1. If Hi\u22121 = Hi Hj , then the statement is obvious. So it suffices to\nconsider the case when Hi\u22121 is the hook permutation obtained from Hi by deleting the m-hook\ntableau with content i. Observe that in this case, i must be the largest content appearing in the\nm-hook tableaux of Hi . In view of Proposition 2.3, we see that Ti\u22121 is the insertion tableau of\nHi\u22121 .\nTo finish the proof of (3.1), we proceed to show that M has a k-crossing if and only if\nthere exists an m-hook permutation Hi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) that contains a decreasing subsequence of\nlength k. Suppose that Hi = Hi1 Hi2 * * * Hiti (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) contains a decreasing subsequence of\nlength k. By the construction of Hi , there are ti m-colored arcs of M whose left-hand endpoints\nare content(Hi1 ), content(Hi2 ), . . . , content(Hiti ). For 1 \u2264 s \u2264 ti , let wis be the right-hand\nendpoint of the arc with left-hand endpoint content(His ). Again, by the construction of the\nsequence (H1 , H2 , . . . , H2n ), it can be easily checked that\nwi1 > wi2 > * * * > witi .\n\n(3.3)\n\nDenote by His1 His2 * * * Hisk the decreasing subsequence of Hi . Clearly, the arcs\n(content(His1 ), wis1 ), . . . , (content(Hisk ), wisk )\nhave the same color. Moreover, from (3.3) it follows that they form a k-crossing of M .\nFinally, we need to consider the other direction of the above statement. Suppose that M\nhas a k-crossing consisting the arcs\n(i1 , j1 ), (i2 , j2 ), . . . , (ik , jk )\nwith i1 < i2 < * * * < ik < j1 < j2 < * * * < jk . By the construction of \u03c6, it can be easily\nchecked that i1 , . . . , ik are contained in content(Tj1 \u22121 ). Consider the m-hook permutation Hj1 \u22121 .\nReplacing i with j1 \u2212 1 in (3.3), we obtain that the subsequence of Hj1 \u22121 consisting of the mhook tableaux with contents i1 , i2 , . . . , ik is a decreasing subsequence of length k. This proves\nthe above claim. Thus, relation (3.1) can be deduced from Theorem 2.2.\nTo prove (3.2), it suffices to show that M has a k-nesting if and only if there exists an m-hook\npermutation Hi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) that contains an increasing subsequence of length k. The proof is\nomitted since it is analogous to the case for k-crossings.\nFigure 3.1 gives an illustration of the bijection \u03c6 for an oscillating domino tableau. In this\ncase, the corresponding 2-colored matching is given in Figure 3.2, where we use solid lines to\nrepresent arcs assigned the color c1 , and dotted lines to represent arcs with color c2 . It can be\n10\n\n\f\u2205\n\n1\n1\n\n1 2\n1 2\n\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\n\n1 3 3\n1\n\n3\n3\n\n3 6\n3 6\n\n6 6\n\n\u2205\n\nFigure 3.1: An illustration of the bijection \u03c6\neasily checked that\n\u2308r(\u03bb)/2\u2309 = ne(\u03c6(\u03bb)) = 1\n\n\u2308c(\u03bb)/2\u2309 = cr(\u03c6(\u03bb)) = 2.\n\nand\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 3.2: An example\nThe bijection in Theorem 3.1 implies a symmetry property for the crossing number and\nthe nesting number of m-colored matchings. Let \u03bb = (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2n ) be an oscillating m-rim\nhook tableau. The conjugate oscillating m-rim hook tableau of \u03bb, denoted by \u03bb\u2032 , is defined by\n(\u03bc0 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bc2n ), where \u03bci is the conjugate of \u03bbi . By Theorem 3.1, we get an involution on\nm-colored matchings satisfying the following symmetry property.\nCorollary 3.2 The crossing number cr(M ) and the nesting number ne(M ) have a symmetric\ndistribution over all m-colored matchings on [2n], that is, the number of m-colored matchings\non [2n] with crossing number i and nesting number j equals the number of m-colored matchings\non [2n] with crossing number j and nesting number i, for 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\nWe note that the above symmetry property can also be deduced from the bijection between\noscillating tableaux and ordinary matchings, see Chen, Deng, Du, Stanley and Yan [3]. More\nprecisely, an m-colored matching M can be considered as a sequence (M1 , M2 , . . . , Mm ) of disjoint matchings on [2n], where Mi is the set of arcs of M colored with ci . It is obvious that M is\nk-noncrossing if and only if each Mi is k-noncrossing. Nevertheless, Theorem 3.1 does not seem\nto be a direct consequence of the correspondence for the case m = 1.\n\n4\n\nOscillating domino tableaux\n\nIn this section, we introduce the structure of packings of Dyck paths and establish a connection\nwith oscillating domino tableaux with each shape having at most two columns. By Theorem 3.1,\nwe see that such oscillating domino tableaux are in one-to-one correspondence with noncrossing\n2-colored matchings. We show that oscillating domino tableaux with at most two columns are in\none-to-one correspondence with Dyck path packings. This means that there is a correspondence\nbetween Dyck path packings and noncrossing 2-colored matchings. It is easy to prove that the\n\n11\n\n\fnumber of noncrossing 2-colored matchings on [2n] equals Cn Cn+1 , where Cn is the n-th Catalan\nnumber.\nAs will be seen, noncrossing 2-colored matchings are quite close to Guy's walks [5] in the\nsense that there is a simple bijection between these two structures. However, it should be\nmentioned that the problem of counting Dyck path packings does not seem to be as easy as\ncounting noncrossing 2-colored matchings. Using the identity\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\n2n\ni=0\n\n2i\n\nCi Cn\u2212j = Cn Cn+1 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nsee [4], we obtain the following formula.\nTheorem 4.1 For n \u2265 0, the number of noncrossing 2-colored matchings on [2n] equals Cn Cn+1 .\nLet O2n,2 be the set of oscillating domino tableaux \u03bb of length 2n with each shape appearing\nin \u03bb having at most two columns. By Theorem 4.1, we see that the set O2n,2 is also counted\nby Cn Cn+1 . We shall give a bijection between O2n,2 and Dyck path packings. A Dyck path of\nlength 2n is a lattice path in the plane from (0, 0) to (2n, 0) with steps (1, 1) and (1, \u22121) that\nnever passes below the x-axis. A dispersed Dyck path is a concatenation of Dyck paths and\nsome horizontal steps (1, 0) on the x-axis. In other words, a dispersed Dyck path of length 2n is\na lattice path from (0, 0) to (2n, 0) with up and down steps above the x-axis and with horizontal\nsteps on the x-axis. We say that a dispersed Dyck path E is weakly covered by a Dyck path D\nif E never goes above D. If D is a Dyck path of length 2n and E is a dispersed Dyck path of\nlength 2n that is weakly covered by D, then we say that the pair (D, E) is a packing of Dyck\npaths of length 2n. Denote by P2n the set of Dyck path packings of length 2n.\nTheorem 4.2 There is a bijection between the set O2n,2 of oscillating domino tableaux and the\nset P2n of Dyck path packings.\nProof. Let \u03bc = (\u03bc0 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bc2n ) be an oscillating domino tableau in O2n,2 , and let \u03bb =\n(\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2n ) be the conjugate oscillating domino tableau of \u03bc, that is, \u03bbi is the conjugate of\n\u03bci (0 \u2264 i \u2264 2n). Since each shape \u03bbi has at most two rows, we may write \u03bbi = (ui , vi ), where\nui \u2265 vi \u2265 0. Clearly, both ui + vi and ui \u2212 vi are even. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, let\nai =\n\nui + vi\n2\n\nand\n\nbi =\n\nui \u2212 vi\n.\n2\n\nDefine two lattice paths D and E by setting\nD = ((0, a0 ), (1, a1 ), . . . , (2n, a2n ))\n\nand E = ((0, b0 ), (1, b1 ), . . . , (2n, b2n )),\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere a lattice path is represented by the lattice points.\nWe proceed to show that the map \u03b1 : \u03bc \u2212\u2192 (D, E) defined by the above construction is a\nbijection from O2n,2 to P2n . As the first step, we prove that (D, E) is a packing of Dyck paths of\nlength 2n. It can be easily checked that a0 = a2n = 0 and (i+ 1, ai+1 )\u2212 (i, ai ) = (1, 1) or (1, \u22121).\n12\n\n\fHence D is a Dyck path of length 2n. Let us consider the possible values of (i + 1, bi+1 ) \u2212 (i, bi ).\nThere are two cases.\nCase 1: \u03bbi+1 is obtained from \u03bbi by adding or deleting a horizontal domino. In this case, it is\neasy to check that (i + 1, bi+1 ) \u2212 (i, bi ) = (1, 1) or (1, \u22121).\nCase 2: \u03bbi+1 is obtained from \u03bbi by adding or deleting a vertical domino. In this case, both \u03bbi\nand \u03bbi+1 have two rows with the same number of cells, that is, ui = vi and ui+1 = vi+1 . This\nimplies that bi = bi+1 = 0 and (i + 1, bi+1 ) \u2212 (i, bi ) = (1, 0). So we deduce that if there is a\nhorizontal step on the path E, then it lies on the x-axis. It is clear that bi \u2265 0. Thus E is a\ndispersed Dyck path of length 2n.\nSince ai \u2265 bi , we see that E is weakly covered by D. Hence we conclude that (D, E) is a\npacking of Dyck paths of length 2n.\nThe inverse map of \u03b1 can be described as follows. Let (D, E) be a Dyck path packing in P2n .\nWrite D and E in the forms as in (4.2). Set \u03bbi = (ai + bi , ai \u2212 bi ), and let \u03bci be the conjugate of\n\u03bbi . It is easy to check that (\u03bc0 , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bc2n ) is an oscillating domino tableau belonging to O2n,2 .\nThis completes the proof.\nFor example, let \u03bb be the conjugate of the oscillating domino tableau in Figure 3.1. The\ncorresponding Dyck path packing is given in Figure 4.1.\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nFigure 4.1: An example for Theorem 4.2\nBy Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2, we obtain the following relations.\nTheorem 4.3 For n \u2265 0,\n|O2n,2 | = |P2n | = Cn Cn+1 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nTo conclude this paper, we give a bijection between noncrossing 2-colored matchings and\nGuy's walks. More precisely, a Guy's walk is defined to be a lattice walk within the first\nquadrant starting and ending at (0, 0) and consisting of the following steps\n(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121), (0, 1), (1, 0).\nFigure 4.2 gives a Guy's walk with steps\n\u2192 \u2191 \u2191 \u2193 \u2192 \u2191 \u2191 \u2192 \u2193 \u2190 \u2193 \u2190 \u2190 \u2191 \u2193 \u2193.\n\n13\n\n\fr\n\n7\nr\n\nr\n\n8 r\n9\n\nr 10 r\n\n14 15 3 4 6 11\nr 13 r 5 r\n12\n16\n2\nr 1 r\nFigure 4.2: A Guy's walk\nTheorem 4.4 There is a bijection between noncrossing 2-colored matchings on [2n] and Guy's\nwalks with 2n steps.\nProof. We construct a bijection \u03b2 from noncrossing 2-colored matchings on [2n] to Guy's walks\nwith 2n steps. Let M be a noncrossing 2-colored matching on [2n]. For any i in [2n], we define\na step si as follows:\n\uf8f1\n(1, 0),\nif i is the left-hand endoint of an arc with color c1 ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 (\u22121, 0),\nif i is the right-hand endpoint of an arc with color c1 ;\nsi =\n\uf8f4\n(0, 1),\nif i is the left-hand endpoint of an arc with color c2 ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(0, \u22121),\nif i is the right-hand endpoint of an arc with color c2 .\n\nThen define \u03b2(M ) to be the walk s1 s2 * * * s2n starting at the origin.\n\nWe claim that \u03b2(M ) is a walk in the first quadrant, starting and ending at the origin. For any\ni \u2208 [2n], consider the first i steps s1 , s2 , . . . , si . Since M is a noncrossing 2-colored matching, it\nis not hard to check that there are at least as many (1, 0) steps as (\u22121, 0) steps in {s1 , s2 , . . . , si }.\nSimilarly, there are at least as many (0, 1) steps as (0, \u22121) steps in {s1 , s2 , . . . , si }. Hence \u03b2(M )\nis in the first quadrant. It is clear that \u03b2(M ) terminates at the origin. So the claim holds. It is\nnot difficult to see that the map \u03b2 is invertible. This completes the proof.\nAcknowledgments.
