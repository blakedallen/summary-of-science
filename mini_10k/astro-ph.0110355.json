Since the blob is more luminous in the infrared by a factor of 30 than Arp 220, it\ncomprises a new population of hyperwind galaxies at high redshift.\nSubject headings: galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: formation \u2013 submillimeter\nthe above properties as well as the observed frequency of\nLABs can be explained in terms of the superwind model\n(Taniguchi & Shioya 2000). Taniguchi & Shioya (2000)\nalso discussed the evolutionary link from dust-enshrouded\n(or dusty) submillimeter sources (hereafter DSSs) to LABs\nbecause the central starburst region in a forming elliptical galaxy could be enshrouded by a lot of gas with dust\ngrains. Their scenario is summarized as follows; Step I:\nThe initial starburst occurs in the center of pregalactic gas\ncloud. Step II: This galaxy may be hidden by surrounding\ngas clouds for the first several times 108 years (i.e., the\nDSS phase). Step III: The superwind blows and thus the\nDSS phase ceases. The superwind leads to the formation of\nextended emission-line regions around the galaxy (i.e., the\nLAB phase). This lasts for a duration of \u223c 1 \u00d7 108 years.\nAnd, Step IV: The galaxy evolves to an ordinary elliptical\ngalaxy \u223c 109 years after the formation. This superwind\nmodel predicts that the LABs are bright at rest-frame farinfrared if they are high-redshift, luminous analogue of\nnearby superwind galaxies like Arp 220.\nThe other idea is that LABs are cooling radiation from\nproto-galaxies or dark matter halos (Haiman, Spaans, &\nQuataert 2000; Fardal et al. 2001; Fabian et al. 1986; Hu\n1992). Standard cold dark matter models predict that a\nlarge number of dark matter halos collapse at high redshift\nand they can emit significant Ly\u03b1 fluxes through collisional\nexcitation of hydrogen. These Ly\u03b1 emitting halos are also\nconsistent with the observed linear sizes, velocity widths,\nand Ly\u03b1 fluxes of the LABs. However, it is uncertain how\nmuch far infrared and submillimeter continuum emission\ncan be emitted because little is known about the dust content and its spatial distribution in such dark matter halos.\nVery recently LAB1 has been detected at submillimeter wavelengths (450 and 850 \u03bcm: Chapman et al. 2001);\nS(850 \u03bcm) = 20.1 \u00b1 3.3 mJy and S(450 \u03bcm) = 76 \u00b1 24\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nIt was once thought that forming galaxies could be\nstrong emission-line sources because a large number of\nmassive stars cause the ionization of gas clouds in the\nforming galaxies (Partridge & Peebles 1967). Motivated\nby this idea, many attempts have been made to search for\nsuch very strong emission-line sources at high redshift, but\nmost these searches failed (Pritchet 1994; Pahre & Djorgovski 1995; Thompson, Mannucci, & Beckwith 1996).\nHowever, for these past several years, Ly\u03b1 emitters have\nbeen found around known high-z objects such as quasars\n(Hu & McMahon 1996; Hu, McMahon, & Egami 1996;\nPetitjean et al. 1996; Hu, McMahon, & Cowie 1999). Further, a number of high-z Ly\u03b1 emitters have also been found\nin several blank sky areas (Pascarelle et al. 1996; Cowie\n& Hu 1998; Keel et al. 1999; Steidel et al. 2000). These\nrecent surveys have reinforced the potential importance of\nsearch for high-z Ly\u03b1 emitters.\nIt is remarkable that two Ly\u03b1 emitters found in Steidel\net al. (2000) are observed to be very extended spatially,\ne.g., \u223c 100 kpc; we call these Ly\u03b1 blobs LAB1 and LAB2.\nThese two LABs are found at redshift z \u2248 3.1 and show\nno evidence for the association with AGNsa . Their observational properties are summarized as below (in this\nLetter, we adopt an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology with a\nHubble constant H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ); 1) the observed Ly\u03b1 luminosities are \u223c 1043 h\u22122 ergs s\u22121 , 2) they\nappear elongated morphologically, 3) their sizes amount\nto \u223c 100 h\u22121 kpc, 4) the observed line widths amount to\n\u223c 1000 km s\u22121 , and 5) they are not associated with strong\nradio-continuum sources such as powerful radio galaxies.\nAs for the origin of the LABs, two alternative ideas\nhave been proposed. One is that these LABs are superwinds driven by the initial starburst in galaxies because all\n\na Such extended Ly\u03b1 blobs have been also found by Pascarelle et al. (1996) and Keel et al. (1999). However, since the three LABs found in\nK99 (53W 002, P96a Object 18, and P96a Object 19) are all strong C iv emitters (Pascarelle et al. 1996), it seems natural to conclude that\nthey are photoionized by the central engine of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Indeed, some powerful radio galaxies at high redshift have giant\nLy\u03b1 nebulae (Chambers, Miley, & van Bruegel 1990; van Ojik et al. 1996). We do not discuss these AGN-related Ly\u03b1 blobs in this Letter.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nmJy. At the position of LAB1, one Lyman break galaxy\ndenoted as C11 is found in the R band image. A nearinfrared (NIR) source is also found close to the center of\nLAB1 in the K band image (Steidel et al. 2000) (hereafter the source K). If we adopt the superwind model of\nTaniguchi & Shioya (2000), the source K is the most probable host galaxy giving rise to LAB1 as the relic of its\nsuperwind.\n2. THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF LYMAN \u03b1\nBLOB 1\n\nIn Figure 1, we show the observed SED of LAB1. In this\nFigure, we show the optical and NIR photometric data for\nboth the source K and C11 are shown. The submillimeter\nsource detected at LAB1 appears indeed coincident with\nthe central Ly\u03b1 knot of LAB1 and this Ly\u03b1 peak has the\nK-band counterpart, the source K (Chapman et al. 2001).\nTherefore, the source K is the most likely host galaxy of\nthe submillimeter sources rather than C11.\nFor comparison, we show SEDs of Arp 220, NGC 6240,\nand SMM 02399\u22120136, all of which are corrected as observed at z = 3.1. Arp 220 is one of typical superwind galaxies in the local universe (Heckman, Armus,\n& Miley 1987, 1990) and its infrared luminosity (LIR \u2261\nL8\u22121000\u03bcm ) exceeds 1012 L\u2299 ; i.e., a ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxy (ULIG: Sanders et al. 1988; Sanders & Mirabel\n1996); LIR (Arp 220) = 1.5 \u00d7 1012L\u2299 with a Friedman universe with a Hubble constant of H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nNGC 6240 is a luminous infrared galaxy in the local universe with evidence for an AGN (Iwasawa 1999). SMM\n02399\u22120136 is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy with evidence for an AGN at z = 2.8 (Ivison et al. 1998). The\nobserved SED of LAB1 is quite similar to that of Arp\n220 although LAB1 is more luminous by a factor of 30\nthan Arp 220b . The SEDs of both NGC 6240 and SMM\n02399\u22120136 appear different from that of LAB1 in that\nthey are brighter than LAB1 at rest-frame UV and optical ranges. The observed S(450 \u03bcm)/S(850 \u03bcm) ratio (3.8\n\u00b1 1.2) implies that the dust temperature is Tdust \u2243 40 K if\nthe source is located at z \u223c 3 (Chapman et al. 2001; Blain\n1999). Indeed, Scoville et al. (1991) estimated Tdust \u2243 47\nK for Arp 220, being consistent with the above prediction.\nThe comparison of SEDs shown in Figure 1 suggests\nstrongly that LAB1 is a very bright infrared galaxy. Since\nits infrared luminosity is higher by a factor of 30 than that\nof Arp 220, we obtain LIR (LAB1) \u2243 4.5 \u00d7 1013L\u2299 . Therefore, LAB1 can be regarded as a hyperluminous infrared\ngalaxy or a hyperwind galaxy at z = 3.1.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nHere we consider why LAB1 is so luminous at submillimeter wavelengths when compared to Arp 220. Although\nArp 220 shows evidence for the superwind activity, it is\nconsidered that ultraluminous starbursts have been going on for \u223c 108 yr (e.g., Taniguchi, Trentham, & Shioya\n\n1998). Furthermore, \u223c 50% of the bolometric luminosity\nis hidden by a large amount of dust grains (Shioya, Trentham, & Taniguchi 2001). This implies that the majority\nof the central energy sources are still covered by a cocoon\nof dust grains and thus Arp 220 is a ULIG with evidence\nfor the superwind activity. Therefore, it is suggested that\nintense star formation is still in progress in the heart of\nLAB1, although massive stars formed in earlier evolutionary phases have already exploded as Type II supernovae,\ngiving rise to the formation of the observed extended Ly\u03b1\nnebula of LAB1. If the origin of LAB1 is attributed to the\ncooling radiation from proto-galaxies or dark matter halos, dust grains would be associated with distributed star\nformation and thus the SED of LAB1 cannot be similar to\nthat of Arp 220.\nIt is known that Arp 220 has a lot of molecular gas of\n\u223c 1010 M\u2299 (Sanders et al. 1988; Scoville et al. 1991; Scoville, Yun, & Bryant 1997). Since LAB1 appears to be a\nscaled-up version of Arp 220, it is expected that the gas\nmass of LAB1 may exceed 1011 M\u2299 , being higher than that\nof a quasar host of BR 1202\u22120725 at z = 4.7 (Ohta et al.\n1996; Omont et al. 1996). The submillimeter detection of\nLAB1 implies that a large amount of dust grains are already present in this source and thus significant flux from\nCO molecules will be detected in the existing millimetric\nradio telescope facilities.\nThe superwind model for LAB1 suggests that LAB1\nis a weak X-ray emitter. Scaling the X-ray data of Arp\n220 (Iwasawa 1999), we estimate a rest-frame 2 - 10 keV\nflux of LAB1 (0.49 - 2.44 keV in the observed frame) as\n1.22 \u00d7 10\u221218 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 for a Friedman cosmology with\nH0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 or 1.74 \u00d7 10\u221218 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 for\na cosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7. If this is the case, LAB1 will not be detected\nin the X-ray even using Chandra (e.g., Mushotzky et al.\n2000; Giacconi et al. 2001; Tozzi et al. 2001).\nAlthough a large number of submillimeter sources have\nbeen found for these past several years (Smail, Ivison, &\nBlain 1997; Hughes et al. 1998; Barger et al. 1998; Eales\net al. 1999), it is known that submillimeter sources at high\nredshift are heterogeneous (Ivison et al. 2000). However,\nif we miss a number of hyperwind galaxies such as LAB1\nin the previous surveys, we could underestimate the starformation rate at high redshift. In order to elucidate the\ncosmic star-formation history unambiguously (Hughes et\nal. 1998; Madau et al. 1996), it will be important to carry\nout deep imaging surveys with narrow-band filters for such\nsubmillimeter sources.\nWe would like to thank an anonymous referee for useful suggestions and comments.
