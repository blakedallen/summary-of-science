We also propose a simple and quantitative explanation for the experimental\nfindings on the statistical distribution of flow reversals and reorientations.\n\nTurbulent convection in a Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard cell is characterized by the complex behaviour of the unstable thermal boundary layers and plumes which produce a large\nscale (turbulent) flow in the cell. Experimentally, it has\nbeen observed that the large scale \"wind\" may exhibit\nabrupt flow reversals [1] and reorientations [2],[3],[4],\nwhose statistical properties have been the subject of some\ntheoretical investigations [1],[5],[8]. Up to now, there has\nnot been any serious numerical simulations aimed at investigating the statistical properties of large scale flow in\nRayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard systems. This is due to the fact that\ninteresting statistical properties of large scale flow are observed (experimentally) only at relatively large Rayleigh\nnumbers Ra, 108 \u2212 1011 , and after having collected data\nfor rather long time periods (up to one year [6]). From\na numerical point of view, major computer facilities are\nneeded in order to properly resolve large Ra conditions\n[7] and simulating these flows for thousands of large eddy\nturnover times is, at present unfeasible. In this Letter,\nby using a suitable strategy, we show how to perform\nnumerical simulations aimed at investigating the statistical properties of large scale flow in Raylaigh B\u00e9nard\nconvection while maintaining the computational requirements at a reasonable level. The flow investigated in\nthis Letter is that developing in a cylindrical cell of aspect ratio (diameter d over cell height h) \u0393 = d/h = 1\nheated from below and cooled from above with an adiabatic side wall. All the surfaces boundary conditions\nare no\u2013slip. 10 azimuthally equi\u2013spaced numerical ideal\nprobes are located on a circle halfway between the plates\nat a radius rp = 0.2h; the \"probes\" provide simultaneous\npoint-wise measurements of temperature and of the three\nvelocity and vorticity components.

The numerical experiments were\nperformed at P r = 0.7 and Ra = 6 \u00d7 105 on a grid of\n33 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 97 nodes, respectively, in the azimuthal, radial\nand vertical directions; this grid was found to be sufficient in [11] for the used flow parameters.

In\nthe inset we show the probability distribution of the vertical\nvelocity as computed in one single probe.\n\ntime scales, too long to achieve an acceptable statistical\nconvergence within a reasonable computational effort. In\norder to increase the turbulent fluctuations, one can either increase the value of Ra or alternatively decrease\nthe Prandtl number (which is equivalent to increase the\nReynolds Re number of the system), both methods implying an increase of numerical resolution. Alternatively,\nwe can artificially increase thermal fluctuations by adding\nto the right hand side of (2) an extra forcing term f ,\n\u03b4 \u2212 correlated in space and\n\u221a time. More precisely the\nexplicit expression is f = \u01eb \u2206t\u03c6 where \u01eb is the amplitude of the perturbation, \u2206t is the time step size and \u03c6\nis a space dependent white\u2013noise random number. The\nphysical motivations for introducing f are twofold: first\nof all, it has been pointed out ([8]) that small scale turbulent fluctuations can be quantitatively considered as an\nexternal random forcing acting on the large scale flow.\nThus, one may consider f as the overall effect of small\n\"unresolved\" turbulent motion for a smaller value of P r.\nSecondly, one can think that the effect of the external\nnoise is to increase thermal diffusivity and, as a consequence, to increase Re at fixed Nusselt number N u Both\narguments, however, have the same physical meaning.\nIn this particular example the Nusselt number resulted\nN u = 4.1 \u00b1 0.1 with and without the external noise on\nthe temperature field, as expected, because the Nusselt is\nessentially independent of P r, i.e. on thermal diffusivity.\nIn figure (1) we show the vertical velocity at one single\nideal location as function of time for \u01eb = 0.1(Th \u2212 Tc ),\nwhile in the inset we show the same result for \u01eb = 0. As\nwe can see, a rather clear increase of the number of reversals is observed by using the external random forcing\nf . The value of \u01eb \u223c 0.1(Th \u2212 Tc) has been chosen by trial\nand error, i.e. not too strong with respect to the deterministic dynamics and not too small to be irrelevant for\nthe time scale of the reversal. As a consistency check,\nhowever, we have run similar simulations using half and\ntwice the above value of \u01eb obtaining similar statistics for\nthe large scale flow. The main simulation was run for\n\n105 time units that on account of the cell geometry correspond to about 105 /\u03c0 \u2248 3 \u00d7 104 large eddy turnover\ntimes. Graphical inspection shows that the flow in the\ncell is roughly divided into two halves, one with a rising\nwarm current (positive vertical velocity) and the other\nwith cold sinking fluid (negative vertical velocity). The\ntwo regions are separated by an \"interface\" where the\nvertical velocity is close to zero. Because of the cylindrical geometry, the interface has no preferred orientation\nand, therefore, it is fluctuates in time. By using the same\nprocedure described in [4] and [3] we can compute the\ninstantaneous orientation \u0398 of the interface. As a consistency check we have applied the same procedure using\neither the temperature and the vertical velocity signals of\nthe probes, always obtaining the same results. In figure\n(2), we show the time behaviour of \u0398, while in the inset\nwe show the probability distribution of the vertical velocity as obtained by measuring it on a single probe. The\nbehaviour of \u0398 is in close agreement with the experimental data of [4] and [3], while the probability distribution\nof the vertical velocity shows a bimodal shape in agreement with [1]. Next we can study the statistical properties of our large scale flow. In particular, the existence\nof a bimodal distribution for the vertical velocity on a\nsingle probe, allows us to study the statistical properties of the (random) switching time (\u03c4 ) between the two\nstates identified as the maxima of the probability shown\nin (2). More precisely, we define \u03c4 as the time interval\nbetween two successive zero\u2013crossings of the vertical velocity at one ideal probe and we compute its probabity\ndistribution P (\u03c4 ). This study was first performed by [1]\nwhere an estimate of the vertical velocity was obtained\nby using the correlation time of two close temperature\nprobes. In [1] and [3] P (\u03c4 ) was found to be a power\nlow for small enough \u03c4 , while at large \u03c4 an exponential\ncutoff in P (\u03c4 ) was observed. This is a rather peculiar\nresult which is difficult to explain by using simple arguments based on the theory of stochastic differential\nequations or chaotic dynamics [8]. Our numerical simulations agree with the experimental results as shown in\nfigure (3, circles). Following [3] we also computed the\nprobability distribution P\u03b4 of \u03c4\u03b4 defined as the time between two events where both \u03b4\u0398 \u2261 \u0398(t + \u03b4t) \u2212 \u0398(t) and\nd\u0398/dt \u2261 \u03b4\u0398/\u03b4t are larger than given thresholds; we have\nused for the thresholds the same values as [3] and have\nverified that the statistical results are robust with respect to the arbitrarily selected values. In the inset of\nfigure 3 we show the log-lin plot of P\u03b4 and compare it\nwith an exponential distribution (line). As observed in\nthe experimental analysis of [3], the probability P\u03b4 seems\nto be fitted rather accurately by an exponential distribution. Figures (2) and (3) show our main results, i.e. our\nnumerical simulations reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental findings. Next, we want to\ndiscuss briefly some theoretical ideas which may help in\nexplaining the power law behaviour of the probability\ndistribution P (\u03c4 ) as computed by [1] and reproduced in\nour simulations. From a theoretical point of view, we\n\n\f3\ncan state the problem as follows: Let Q be a random\nvariable whose probability distribution is bimodal with\nmaxima in \u00b1Q0 and let \u03c4Q be the (random) switching\ntime between the maxima. Is there any \"simple\" model\nfor which P (\u03c4Q ) shows a power law behaviour for small\n\u03c4Q ? We will show that such a model does exist and it\nmay be relevant for thermal convection.

Then the equation for \u03c80\nreads:\n\u2202t \u03c80 = (m \u2212 3gh\u03c62 is )\u03c80 \u2212 g\u03c803 + \u03c3s \u03b7(t)\n\nlandau ginzburg\ndouble well\nexperimental data\n\n0\n\n\u2202t \u03c8 = m\u03c8 \u2212 g\u03c8 3 + \u03bd\u2206\u03c8 + \u03c3\u03b7(x, y, t)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a white noise in time. More precisely, let\nus consider (3) defined on a regular lattice of N \u00d7 N\npoints of spacing \u2206x = \u2206y = L/N . Then \u03c3s \u2261 \u03c3/N 2\nand we assume \u03c3s = const. for any N (see [13] for a\ncorrect definition of the problem). It is worth reminding that the equilibrium probability distribution of (3)\nhas been widely used as a model of second order phase\ntransition in the infinite volume limit. For a suitable\nchoice of the parameters m,g and \u03bd, the term h\u03c62 is can be\nlarge when \u03c80 becomes small, i.e. the system at \u03c80 \u223c 0\nshows strong fluctuations as it is usual in second order\nphase transitions. In this case, the linear term in (4),\ni.e. (m \u2212 3gh\u03c62 is ), can occasionally change sign and the\nswitching between the two maxima of the probability distribution of \u03c80 can be more frequent. This is equivalent\nto say that the switching time is no longer controlled\nby the mechanism leading to an exponential distribution\nand one can observe a scale (in time) invariant probability distribution, i.e. a power law. In figure (4) we\nshow the probability distribution of the switching time\nof \u03c80 obtained by numerically integrating equation (3),\nfor N = 32, \u03bd = 0.1, m = 1, g = 9 and \u03c3s = 0.05. In\nparticular we plot the probability distribution of log(\u03c4 ),\nwhere \u03c4 is the random switching time computed by using the parameter \u03c80 . Note that if P (\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u22121 then\nP (log(\u03c4 )) \u223c const. In the same figure we show the probability distribution of log(\u03c4 ) for the experimental data by\n[1]) and for the well known case of an over-damped Brownian particle in a double well potential with the same parameter m and g and stochastically perturbed by a white\nnoise with variance \u03c3s . In the last case, we know that the\nprobability distribution of \u03c4 is exponential and, indeed,\nin figure (4), P (log(\u03c4 )) for the double well potential is\nnot constant. On the other hand, P (log(\u03c4 )) is constant\nfor almost one decade for the numerical simulation of (3)\nusing \u03c80 as order parameter. Thus, we may tentatively\nstate that the equation (3), and in particular (4), can be\n\n\f4\nconsidered as a conceptual model for the experimental\nresults of [1]). From a physical point of view, we remark\nthat there exists a non trivial feedback between the variance of the fluctuations in space and the value of the\norder parameter \u03c80 . It is now tempting to understand\nwhether the same \"physical\" mechanism can be observed\nin our numerical simulation of the Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard turbulence. According to our previous discussion, the overall picture which emerges is quite simple and agrees with\nthe original description of [4]. As a first approximation\nwe can think that the large scale flow rotates randomly\nin time with some orientation \u0398(t) performing a random\nwalk in the interval [0, 2\u03c0]. The vertical velocity in a\nsingle point is almost insensitive to \u0398 unless the interface is close to the ideal probe. A suitable model for\n\u0398(t) can be build as follows. Let us consider two variables x1 = r cos(\u03b8) and x2 = r sin(\u03b8) which satisfy the\nfollowing equation\ndxi\n\u2202V\n+ noise\n=\u2212\ndt\n\u2202xi\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V \u2261 \u22121/2r2 (R2 \u2212 r2 ) and r2 = x21 + x22 , i.e. r \u223c R\nfor most of the time. We can imagine that \u03b8 is precisely\nthe variable \u0398 describing the interface direction of the\nlarge scale wind. Then denoting by w the value of the\nvertical velocity, a qualitative model of w as a function\nof \u03b8(t) is simply given by:\nsin(\u03b8)\nx2\n= p\nw=p 2\n2 (\u03b8) + A/r2\nsin\nx2 + A\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the parameter A is a measure of the interface thickness, whose fluctuations are controlled by r. Using (6)\nand our simple model, one can easily show that:\ndw\n= aw \u2212 (a + bA)w3 + noise\ndt\n\n(7)\n\n[1] K.R. Sreenivasan, A. Bershadskii and J.J. Niemala,\nPhys. Rev.

However the term a can change sign (exactly as in (4)) because of the (strong) fluctuations of x1 .\nIn order to compute the probability distribution of the\nswitching time \u03c4 between the two maxima in the probability of w, we have numerically integrated equation (5),\nwith R = 1, A = 0.1 and the variance of the noise equal\nto 0.1. The final result is shown in figure (5) (small black\ncircles) and compared with the experimental finding of\n[1] (line with symbol). As we can see P (\u03c4 ) is close to\na power law with slope \u22121 in agreement with the experimental findings of [1]. In the same figure, we show\nthe probability distribution P (\u03c4 ) p\ncomputed by using the\napproximate value w \u223c sin(\u0398)/ sin2 (\u0398) + A and the\nvalue of \u0398 obtained in the numerical simulation (see figure (2)). A good agreement is observed with a power\nlaw P (\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u22121 . Thus (6) seems to capture the physical reason for the observed numerical and experimental\nresults in the statistical properties of flow reversal. In\nsummary, we have shown that the statistical properties\nof large scale flow in Rayleigh B\u00e9nard convection can be\nefficiently simulated by using an external random forcing in the temperature field. The effect of the forcing\nis to increase thermal diffusivity, i.e. to decrease the\nPrandtl number. Consequently, the effective Reynolds\nnumber achieved in this way is larger with respect to\nthe one without external forcing. Our numerical simulations agrees qualitatively and quantitatively with the\nexperimental findings of [1], [3] and [4]. Finally, we have\ndiscussed some theoretical ideas which may be able to\nexplain the statistical properties of flow reversals.\nWe acknowledge K.R. Sreenivasan, G. Alhers, K.Q.\nXia, T. Sato, L.
