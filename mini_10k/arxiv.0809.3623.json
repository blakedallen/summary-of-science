Modern cosmology provided the answer: our universe was born with Big Bang\ninflation. While the exact energy scale \u039b at which this event ocurred is not known, it is\nwidely believed that the universe was at extremely high energies at the instance of the\nBig Bang, possibly at Grand Unified Scale, GUT (1016 GeV), or higher. Then as inflation\npropelled the universe into an accelerated expansion, the universe grew big and cooled\ndown. Primordial fluctuations of this inflaton field then seeded the observed structure of the\nuniverse. This is the beauty of the inflation paradigm, it provides such a simple picture for\nsuch a complex and intricate system. The exquisite agreement of the inflationary scenario\nwith the vast amount of astrophysical data accumulated over the last few decades makes\nthis paradigm even more impressive. But what is really amazing is how unnatural inflation\nis when considering that the probability for the high energy Big Bang inflation to occur, is\nextraordinarily small by standard estimates. And here lies the puzzle: what selected such\nextremely unlikely initial conditions for the birth of our universe?\nThe probability P depends exponentially on the entropy S of the initial patch at Big\nBang, P = eS , (where the entropy is a quantity that measures the amount of disorder\nor information contained in the universe). But since for systems in thermal equilibrum,\nS is inversely proportional to the energy scale \u039b, then the probability is exponentially\nsuppressed with the energy at the time of the Big Bang, P = e1/\u039b . Thus the higher the\nenergy scale at which Big Bang switches on, the less likely it is for the universe to nucleate\nfrom such an event. In fact, if our universe started at GUT scale, Roger Penrose estimated\n123\nthat such an event has only one chance in 1010 possibilities. At first, this estimate seems\nto imply that the birth of the universe was a very special event indeed. It also implies that\nsince other events are overwhelmingly more likely to nucleate then they should be present\naround us today in abundance and worse, these events should outnumber us. This latter\nparadox is known as the Boltzmann Brains (BB's) paradox. A third problem stemming from\nthe puzzle of the selection of the initial conditions is the problem of the thermodynamic\narrow of time: we observe that time flows in a definite orientation from past to future,\nan orientation which, according to the second law of thermodynamics (an empirical law\nby itself) is determined by the direction of the entropy increase. The trouble here is that\nthe universe had to start from a low entropy state in order to have the observed arrow of\ntime. But the price to pay is that a low entropy initial state suggests an exponentially\nsmall chance for that event to have occurred. We have not seen any BB's around, we\nobserve that time flows from past to future. But we also know that the theory of Big Bang\ninflation, known as standard cosmology, has passed all observational tests. Yet it appears\nso unnatural and unlikely when faced with the question: why did we start with such an\nextremely ordered initial condition and, what selected this special state?\nThe deep mystery of the initial conditions and the paradoxes that standard estimates\nproduce, are probably indicating that the problem lies with our understanding and in the\ntheoretical framework we are using, rather than in flaws of inflation or anthropic designs.\nAs is often the case in physics, progress towards probing one mystery of nature results in\ntrading-off the old set of questions for new ones that are usually deeper and more complex.\n1\n\n\fInflation addressed our questions about the observed flatness, homogeneity and structure\nin the universe. But it produced a new and more severe mystery, that of the selection of its\ninitial state,which for high energy inflation seems to be the most unlikely state the universe\ncould pick, one that is far less likely than starting with a big cold universe with all the\ninternal structure of our current universe.\nUnderstanding the birth of our universe is the most important mystery in our understanding of nature. I have been advocating that the only way to meaningfully address this\npuzzle is by extending our physical theories within a multiverse framework; by dropping all\nthe unwarranted assumptions of thermal equilibrum and ergodicity and, by investigating\nthe quantum dynamics of all the degrees of freedom in this ensemble of initial patches,\nespecially the dynamics of gravitational degrees of freedom. As I describe below, by doing\nso yields a much more reasonable answer for the chance of starting the universe with high\nenergy inflation. An exciting prospect described further below, is that this approach makes\npredictions that can be tested by our present and near future data, thereby giving this\ntheory the potential to be falsified.\n\n2\n\nWhy did the Universe Start in such an Extremely\nOrdered State?\n\nWe talk of entropy as a measure of disorder. Thus the lower the entropy the more ordered\nthe system. The usual example given is that a broken glass is in a state of higher disorder\nand higher entropy as compared to a glass that remains intact. Disorder is a fuzzy concept\nto quantify and an intuitive grasp of entropy is not sufficient. Yet, understanding the\nselection of the initial conditions for our universe is equivalent to a deeper understanding of\nthe entropy of the universe, both quantitatively and qualitatively. So, we need to dissect this\nmystery into more transparent ingredients. To do so, it is helpful to look at the concept\nof entropy in a different way, in terms of information contained in this disorder which\ncounts the number of states available to the disordered system. Information in a system\nis carried in correlations among its degrees of freedom. Entropy measures the amount of\ninformation, (equivalent to disorder), contained in a system. Correlations can be calculated\nmathematically in a precise manner, and yet we are on shaky grounds when defining the\nentropy in our universe and subsequently the probability for such a universe to exist. So,\nalthough we know how to estimate correlations, the mystery of the entropy and initial\nconditions of the universe boil down to: which correlations are we to include in the entropy\nof the universe?\nAs described in the previous section the general estimate of the entropy of the universe\nwas based on the 'black box' model. This means we make a major assumption that degrees\nof freedom in the universe are in perfect thermal equilibrum, and that the counting of\nentropy internally reflects our ignorance of the information outside which is cut off by the\nwalls of the box,and which, in this case the horizon of the universe. In the 'black box'\napproach the correlations among the internal and external degrees of freedom are assumed\nto be zero.\n2\n\n\fIn 2005 I took the point of view that, in order to get a sensible answer, we need to\nincorporate the dynamics of gravitational degrees of freedom and study the problem of the\nentropy of the universe as a non-equlibrum system within the framework of the extended\nphysics of the multiverse, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nThere are good reasons to take this approach, which I'll briefly account for here:\ni. Our previous assumptions in studying the initial conditions for equilibrum and ergodicity, can not be justified. Based on these assumptions we are led to the expression\nP = eS followed by a series of paradoxes when trying to explain the birth of our universe.\nTherefore it is best we do not make these assumptions without checking whether they hold\nbefore using them. As was shown in [4, 5] the very early universe is far out of equlibrum\nand the phase space is not ergodic due to being cleaned out of the low energy 'terminal'\nuniverses.\nii. Gravitational degrees of freedom play an important role in the overall dynamics,\nespecially in the very early universe when this interaction is non-negligible. To illustrate\nthis point let us think of the gravitational dynamics of the vacuum energy \u039b that gives rise\nto Big Bang inflation. As is well known the tendency of any system is to try and reach\nequilibrum by maximizing entropy. But as matter degrees of freedom tend to equlibrum\nby trying to pull the initial patch to a ('black hole') crunch, the gravitational degrees\nof freedom contained in \u039b tend to equlibrum by trying to expand that initial patch to\ninfinity. Since any realistic system of cosmology will contain both matter and gravitational\ndegrees of freedom, then their opposing tendencies in this 'tug-of-war' on the initial patch\nguarantee two things: first, that this system is far from being in equlibrum; and second, that\ntheir dynamics provides a (super-)selection rule for the initial conditions of the universe by\nleading to 'survivor' and 'terminal' universes. If \u039b 'wins' over matter the initial patch grows\ngiving rise to a 'survivor' universe, which is a physically relevant entity. But if the pull of\nmatter is stronger than the effect of \u039b on the expansion of the universe, then the initial\npatch can not grow and contracts, resulting in a 'terminal' universe. Thus the selection\nof universes that start with high a energy scale for \u039b is naturally driven by the quantum\ndynamics of gravity. This ingredient, the quantum dynamics of gravitational degrees of\nfreedom, was not included in the previous attempts at addressing the selection of the initial\nconditions. As is often the case in science, what we missed out is highly significant.\niii. Another important aspect in this radically new way of thinking is the need to\nextend our physical theories within a multiverse framework. The dominant expectation\nso far for the ,(yet unknown), theory of quantum gravity (QG) has been the 'reductionist'\nhope that relies on QG producing one unique solution that resembles the general features of\nour universe. We have failed so far on this view. Au contraire, as described in more detail\nin Sec. 4 \u2212 6, the success of three major theories in physics has taught us otherwise.That\nthe three different and important theories, quantum mechanics, string theory and inflation,\nall predict the existence of the multiverse is, I believe, hardly coincidental. How else can\nwe ask the question: why did we start with these initial conditions, without implying, as\ncompared to what other choices? If there is only one sample available to choose from then\nthere is no point asking: why did we end up with this sample. We are guaranteed in\nthat case that we can not end up with anything else but this sample. This 'reductionist'\n\n3\n\n\fscenario does not allow any selection questions since it has already assigned the probability\nweights to be 1 for the sample and 0 for any other option. A question about selection\nthus makes sense only when we have a pool of 'universe samples' to choose from, (a.k.a a\nmultiverse). So far I have made no distinction in relation to the question: is the multiverse\na mathematical or a physical entity. Issues related to the structure and the embedding\nspacetime(s) of the multiverse are discussed in Sec.4 \u2212 6. But the important argument I\nwould like to present here is that the existence of the multiverse must be expected from\nthe underlying fundamental theory or else we can not meaningfully address the mystery of\nthe initial conditions. In this 'meritocratic' view, the extension of our current cosmology\nwithin a multiverse framework becomes an extension of the Copernican principle to nature.\nIn Sec.4 \u2212 6, in order to discuss the ontology of the multiverse I propose to apply two\nprinciples:\n- the principle of 'No Perpetual Motion' as a criterion for the parameter of time; and,\n- the principle of 'Domains Correlations' as a criterion for determining the background\nspacetime in which the multiverse is embedded.\n\n2.1\n\nSelection of the Initial Conditions for our Universe on the\nLandscape\n\nHaving now laid out the main ingredients, we are ready to apply this dynamic approach to\nthe selection of the initial conditions for our universe within the multiverse framework.\nThe landscape of string theory [6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 10] will be our working model for providing\na physically motivated example of the multiverse space, for the following reasons: every\nlandscape vacua hosts a potential birth place for a universe. Therefore the collection of\nall string vacua solutions that comprise the landscape, is an ensemble of possible universes\n[4, 5, 1, 2, 12, 13]. We can think of the landscape of string theory as the energy profile\nV (\u03c6) of some string moduli field \u03c6, which plays the role of a collective coordinate. The\ninternal degrees of freedom in each vacua site, are centered around the mean vacua field\n\u03c6j with vacuum energy \u039bj = V (\u03c6j ), and can be thought as perturbations around the\nmean value of the field \u03c6. In an important work, Michael Douglas and Frederik Denef [11]\nstudied the structure and distribution of vacua in the landscape. I will use their model for\nthe landscape structure in what follows below, including the distribution of the internal\ndegrees of freedom in each vacua, (see [4, 5] for the technical details). The distribution\nthey found for the vacua energies on the landscape is very similar to randomly disordered\ncondensed matter systems and quantum dots, as discussed in [4], known as the universality\nclass of CI-type [14]. In the case of the landscape the number of vacua \u2032 j \u2032 is expected to be\nin the order of 10500 .\nI will treat the problem quantum mechanically and make the assumption that quantum\nmechanics is a fundamental theory of nature, that is, that this theory is valid at all energy\nscales. Quantum mechanics can be embedded into the landscape multiverse by allowing\nthe wavefunction of the universe [15, 16, 17] to propagate on the landscape of string theory,\nwhich was proposed in [1, 2]. The solutions to the 'Schrodinger'-like equation, which in\nquantum cosmology is known as the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation [16, 17], can be cal4\n\n\fculated by analogy with the above condensed matter systems, using random matrix theory.\nThe important caveat worth emphasizing is the subtlety related to the time parameter:\nthe intrinsic time in the wavefunction should be interpreted as fundamental, like it is in\nquantum mechanics, rather than born out of WdW solutions.\nThe WdW equation is defined on a two dimensional (2 \u2212 dim hereon), minisuperspace\nparametrized by two variables, (a, \u03c6): the scale factor a(t) of universes with spatially flat\n3 \u2212 dim geometries, given by the metric: ds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 dx2 , where x stands for the 3 \u2212 dim\nspace variable and t for time; and, by the moduli field \u03c6 of the landscape, with energy V (\u03c6),\non which the wavefunction of the universe propagates. Then the WdW equation states that\nthe hamiltonian operator H on the minisuperspace, which characterizes the total energy of\nthis 2-variable system, when acting on the wavefunctional of the universe \u03a8[a, \u03c6], must give\nzero energies. (For this reason the WdW equation is often referred to as the 'constraint\nequation'). The WdW equation is:\n\n\u0124\u03a8(a, \u03c6) = 0 with\n\"\n#\n\u22022\n4\u03c0 \u2202 2\n1\n6\u03b1\n\u2212\n+ e V (\u03c6) .\n\u0124 = 3\u03b1\n2e\n3Mp2 \u2202\u03b12 \u2202\u03c62\n\n(1)\n\nFor mathematical simplicity, here the scale factor a has been written as a = e\u03b1 and the energy around the vacua sites approximated by the expression V (\u03b1, \u03c6) = e6\u03b1 m2 \u03c62 + e4\u03b1 \u03ba, \u03ba =\n0, \u22121 for flat or closed universes, and Mp is the reduced Planck mass, (which is related\nto the usual Planck mass mp by absorbing a factor of 8\u03c0, 8\u03c0Mp2 = m2p , and is often used\nin equations for the simplicity of short-hand notation). The \"mass\"-like parameter, m2 ,\ncorresponds to the curvature of the vacua, m2 \u2243 d2 V /d\u03c62 , vacua with energy \u039b \u2243 m2 \u03c62 /2.\nThe hat symbol denotes the quantum mechanical operator. From Eqn.1 it can be seen that\nindeed the hamiltonian H contains the kinetic and potential energies for both variables,\nthe scale factor a corresponding to the 3\u2212 geometries and the moduli \u03c6 corresponding to\nthe landscape vacua energies.\nThe probability distribution for the wavefunction of the universe solutions is found by\nthe quantum mechanical expression of the norm squared, P = |\u03a8[a, \u03c6]|2. Calculated in\n[1, 2] this expression shows that the most probable universe is found to sit at vacua with\nthe minimum nonnegative, i.e. zero, energies. Clearly this is not correct and we know\nthat our universe started at high energies. The reason for this incorrect result lies with the\nlimitations of the WdW equation which is not sufficient for treating the quantum dynamics\nof the system [4, 5]. We need to incorporate in our investigation the issue of how these\n'universe' solutions decohere (decouple) from each other at later times when they undergo\na quantum to classical transitions.\nDecoherence is induced by the 'environment' or 'bath' during the process of measuring\nthe 'system' [18], thereby triggering the quantum to classical transition for the (3+1)\u2212dim\nworlds and the decay of entanglement among the different worlds [19]. We thus need to\nidentify 'the bath' and 'the system' for our problem. Decoherence [18, 19, 20] in this problem\nis taken into account by including the effect of the 'bath' consisting of superhorizon sized\nwavelength massive fluctuations, into the 'system', which is comprised of degrees of freedom\n5\n\n\finside the horizon of the universe.\nThe wavepacket with the (3 + 1) \u2212 dim geometry sitting in one of the landscape vacua\nis 'the system', ( which in real spacetime eventually becomes our universe). But the 'measurer', the environment, needs to be chosen carefully such that, when it interacts with the\nsystem, it does not interfere with the outcome of the observable that it is measuring. A\ncandidate for the 'bath', are the degrees of freedom of the very long massive perturbations,\nwith superhorizon size wavelengths \u03bbn . These perturbation modes are coupled gravitationally to the 'system' which consists of all degrees of freedom inside the horizon H. Since the\nstrength of coupling goes as GN /\u03bb, with GN being the Newton's constant, then for really\nlarge wavelengths \u03bbn \u2265 lH , where lH is the horizon size, the strength of coupling of these\nenvironment modes to the system is very small, guaranteeing a very weak coupling of these\nmodes with the 'system' as they 'watch' the system. Superhorizon sized perturbations are\nthus our chosen 'environment' in which the 'system' is immersed. But there is an infinite\nnumber of these fluctuations fn in the 'bath'. The 'bath' consists of all fluctuations with \u03bbn\nin the range from lH to infinity, ( where n is the label that counts the modes), and energies:\n\u22022\n2\nHn = \u2212 \u2202f\n2 + Un fn , calculated in [22], where the first term represents the kinetic energy and\nn\nthe second term Un fn2 represents the potential energy of these fn modes with Un similar to\na mass term [21]. The total contribution of the 'bath' given by the sum over all its modes\n\u03a3n Hn , backreacts on the geometry of the 'system' by perturbing the variables a, \u03c6 in the\nWdW equation. Let's now add the sum \u03a3Hn of the total contribution of these perturbation\nmodes with \u03bbn \u2265 lH into the WdW equation, [4, 5]. This new term added to the WdW\nhamiltonian H0 , represents the backreaction of the 'bath' onto the 'system ' [18, 19]. With\nthe inclusion of the backreaction term, the WdW equation becomes a 'Master' equation\n[4, 12, 13]\n\u01240 \u03a8[a, \u03c6] = \u2212\u03a3\u0124n \u03a8[a, \u03c6],\n\n(2)\n\nThe Master Equation is now not constrained to zero energies due to the new backreaction term Hn . The interesting part is that during inflation, the backreaction term is\nnegative, playing the role of a negative mass-squared term in the Master Equation [21]. The\nsignificance of a negative mass is that it creates gravitational instabilities in the solutions.\nThus the backreaction of superhorizon sized fluctuations creates a gravitational instability\nfor the wavefunction of the universe by counterbalancing the effect of the vacuum energy\n\u039b \u2243 m2 \u03c62 in driving the expansion of the initial (3 + 1) \u2212 dim world. When does this\ninstability occur? If the \u039b term is larger than \u03a3Hn then the overall mass given by the sum\nof the two terms is positive and the instability does not occur. That means that solutions\nfor the wavefunction of the universe exist and a universe is born for each vacua on the landscape that has a vacuum energy \u039b larger then the backreaction term. On the other hand,\nall the vacua with energies \u039b \u2264 \u03a3Hn host 3-geometries/worlds that can not survive and\ncan not expand due to the gravitational instabilites induced on these initial patches from\nthe strong backreaction term. In this case, mathematical solutions to the Master equation\nfor the wavefunction \u03a8[a, \u03c6] corresponding to expanding (3 + 1) \u2212 dim worlds do not exist\nfor the low initial energies \u039b. Physically we can understand the out-of-equlibrum dynamics of vacua energies and massive modes on the landscape by thinking of all the matter\n6\n\n\fmodes contained in \u03a3Hn as making up a black hole with surface gravity \u03baBH and a DeSitter (inflationary) universe with vacuum energy \u039b and surface gravity of DeSitter geometry\n\u03baDS . So, visually we have a black hole inside a DeSitter inflating space. The black hole is\ntrying to pull the initial space into a point while the DeSitter geometry is trying to drive\nthe universe into an accelerated expansion. Depending which surface gravity is stronger\ndetermines whether the black hole 'pull' wins over the DeSitter drive to expansion or if the\nbackreaction of the black hole on the geometry is just 'denting' an otherwise exponentially\nexpanding space. The entropy S of these out-of-equlibrium systems that are in an entangled\nstate can be readily estimated from the Master equation. The general expression for S is\nquite complicated but for the simplified case of the black hole inside a DeSitter space, the\nexpression reduces to the entropy obtained for Schwarzschild-DeSitter geometries by [22],\nS \u2243 (rI \u2212 rfn )2 rI \u2243 HI\u22121 rfn \u2243 (HI\n\n\u22123/2\n\n\u221a\n< \u03c6I U >).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere rI = lH denotes the De-Sitter horizon of the inflationary patches with Hubble\nparameter HI , entropy S, and rfN the horizon of the 'black hole' made up from the fn\nmodes where the average value of the mode < fn > is of order the mean vacuum state \u03c6I ,\n< fn >\u2243 \u03c6I .\nThe cuttoff derived for the ensemble of the initial states above, namely, the lower bound\non the survivor from backreaction of the universes, corresponds to HI = m, \u03c6I = Mp . It\nis interesting that this corresponds to the case of a zero entropy for the DeSitter - Black\nhole system, which is the case when the horizon and surface gravity rI\u22121 = \u03baDS of the\n= \u03baBH of the black hole.\nDeSitter patch coincide with the horizon and surface gravity rf\u22121\nn\nThis means that a black hole with the same horizon as the initial inflationary patch is the\nborderline between the 'terminal' and 'survivor' universes. More to the point, the value of\nentropy S = 0 provides the lower bound on the initial conditions HI , \u03c6I for giving birth to\na universe.\nTo summarize: Initial states that start at high energies survive the backreaction of superhorizon modes on their space, thus they are named 'survivor' universes. Initial states\nthat start at low energies can not survive the backreaction of the superhorizon sized 'environment' thereby developing gravitational instabilities that crunch them to a point. For\nthis reason these are named the 'terminal' universes. Although we started with an ensemble of all possible initial conditions and energies on the string landscape multiverse, only\na fraction of them, initial states with high energies \u039b, are selected as physically relevant\n'survivor' universes. 'Terminal' universes can not grow and therefore are not physically\nrelevant since these initial states can not give birth to a universe. This new theory shows\nhow the quantum dynamics of gravity and matter on a landscape multiverse results in\na superselection rule for the inital conditions of the universe. The selection of 'survivor'\nuniverses that start at high energies and therefore low entropies is driven by the quantum\ndynamics of gravity in the ensemble of the initial conditions. Although the initial ensemble\nof all possible initial states has shrunk to a subset by being wiped clean of the low energy\npatches, it still contains a whole multiverse of high energy 'survivor' universes.\n\n7\n\n\f3\n\nTestable Predictions?\n\nIs this theory falsifable? This approach provides a satisfactory understanding of the deep\nmystery of the selection of the initial state, while offering a radically new way of thinking in\nterms of the quantum dynamics of gravity and the need for a multiverse framework. Thus\nthe tantalizing question at this stage becomes: can the theory make predictions that can\ntest it? As amazing as it sounds when considering that our framework is the multiverse,\nthe possibility for hunting down imprints leftover from the earliest time and traces of the\nmultiverse, is real. The reasons are simple:\n- the present universe provides a giant laboratory for testing microscopic phenomena\nthat occured at its earliest times since the large scales today are a blown up version of the\ntiniest scales at the beginning, since they are redshifted from the small scales of the initial\nnon-equlibrium phenomena;\n- the sacred principle of quantum mechanics, our starting basis of the theory, is the\nUnitarity Principle,which states that information can never be lost. This means that if our\nuniverse started in a mixed state in the landscape multiverse, than it can never evolve into\na pure state at late times. Information contained in the superhorizon size entanglement\nof our universe with all else outside can not be lost. This entanglement leaves its traces\neverywhere in the present observable sky.\nThese two reasons provide a whole series of imprints on the large scale structure (LSS)\nand cosmic microwave anisotropies (CMB) in the universe, derived in [12, 13].\nFinally, I should mention that if supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theory of nature than the\nlandscape vacua energies were acquired by the SUSY breaking mechanism. These energies\n\u039b are then determined by the SUSY breaking scale 'b' in them. This implies that there are\ntwo fundamental scales in the theory: the global scale which can be the Planck mass or\nstring scale, Mp , and is the same for all the vacua; and, the SUSY breaking scale b which is\na local scale since it varies from one vacuum state to the next. Whenever a theory contains\ntwo dimensionful constants of nature, these parameters and their combination have to be\na part of the observables we measure. Thus, if our universe acquired its initial vacuum\nenergy by breaking SUSY, this breaking scale will be found in our measurements.\nHow are these traces of entanglement from the very early universe calculated? We have a\ntheory of Big Bang inflation that tells us that LSS and CMB were seeded by the primordial\nfluctuation. The perturbation theory also allows us to calculate the present structure and\nCMB in the universe from the primordial spectrum, through the evolution equations. The\nmost important ingredient for the structure is the estimation of the background Newtonian\ngravitational potential \u03a6 which maps the gravitational field of the large scale structure in the\nuniverse. We have direct measurements for \u03a6. In the theory I have described here, besides\nthe primordial fluctuation of inflation produced within our patch that seed the observed\nstructure, we have a second channel of contribution to the Newtonian potential \u03a6 for this\nstructure which originates from the (highly non-local) superhorizon size entanglement of\nour universe with all the modes outside. The modification \u03b4\u03a6 this nonlocal entanglement\ninduces on \u03a6, can be derived in a precise manner by known physics equations and allows\nno room for phenomenology. When tracing out the effect of nonlocal entanglement on our\n8\n\n\funiverse, the energy of the initial waveapacket of our universe gets shifted and that shift\nproduces the observable modification on the background potential of the universe. This\nmodification to the primordial spectrum of perturbation and the Newtonian gravitational\npotential \u03a6, derived in [12, 13], which is superimposed to the standard inflationary potential\n\u03a60 , when evolved to present times carries all the observational imprints that can be observed\nin LSS and CMB, discussed in [12, 13].\nThe modification on \u03a6 = [\u03a60 + \u03b4\u03a6[b, V (\u03c6)]] originates from the backreaction term\nthat was described in the previous section. Thus it has the opposite sign to the standard\nNewtonian potential \u03a60 , a case very similar to superimposing a negative mass on a positive\nmass. The result is an overall suppression of the amplitude of perturbations, \u03c38 , and a hole\nwhich in the sky show up as voids. But, considering that at present the strength of nonlocal\nentanglement is very small, then without resorting to the mathematical expression for \u03a6\nin [12, 13], it can still be understood why the maximum modification, i.e. voids, will be\nfound at very large scales, at the 'edges' of the universe, where the entanglement strength is\nrelatively larger and physics is nearly linear. At shorter distances such as galaxy of cluster\nscales the messy nonlinear gastrophysics of structure formation would erase any small traces\nof modifications. We carried out this calculation for the modified Newtonian potential in\n[12, 13] and predicted that a giant void of a size of about 12 degrees in the sky, should\nbe found at about 8 billion lightyears away. Such a huge void can not be accommodated\nwithin the standard cosmology scenario which has only one channel for producing structure,\na structure expected to be uniformly distributed by standard cosmology. Amazingly, this\ngiant void was observed only a few months later, in 2007, by the Very Large Array Telescopes\n(VLA) radio measurements [23]. Although previously a cold spot in the skymaps of the first\nyear and third year run of Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP) experiment had\nbeen spotted [25] the team were cautious in intrepreting the observation of nongaussianities\nas significant since the cold spot seemed to correspond to only a point-like source while the\nrest of the data in the skymaps were in excquisite agreement with inflationary predictions\nfor a gaussian spectrum of the Microwave Background sky. A cold spot could, in principle,\nbe taken as indirect evidence for the existence of a void. But it could also be consistent with\nthe existence of textures, a possibility raised in 2007 in [27]. Therefore the observation of\nthe void made by Rudnick et al [23], (see also [9]), was highly significant because: unlike the\nindirect measurements of WMAP they found direct evidence for the void; and, because the\nvoid they observed happened to be at exactly the same location as the WMAP's cold spot,\nthereby confirming that the the nongaussianities seen in the WMAP's data were significant.\nHowever this observed void is not the end in our void's 'story': As I mentioned, the\nlargest effect where the modification to Newtonian potential \u03a6 is at maximum strength,\nshould be found at the largest present scales, the 'quadrupole' scales. These scales are\nseparated by 60 degrees in the sky which correspond to the earliest moments at the onset\nof inflation and the largest observable sky in the present universe. Our second testable\npredictio is that another void should be found at the 'quadrupole' scale.\nThe new channel of contribution originating from the nonlocal entanglement, and the\nmodification it induces on our universe affects the expansion law and structure formations,\ncan be understood by the fact that a modified Newtonian potential also results in a modified\nFriedmann equation for the expansion of the universe.\n9\n\n\fAfter including the backreaction due to the tracing of the long wavelength modes, the\neffective Friedmann equation was shown to be modified [12, 13] by a nonlocal term F (b, V ).\nThis term reflects the nature of the entanglement of our universe, during Big Bang at high\nenergies \u039b = V = m2 \u03c62 /2, and it also contains the second parameter of its SUSY breaking\nscale b:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n!2\n1 V (\u03c6)\nVeff\n1 \uf8f0\nV (\u03c6) +\nF (b, V )\uf8fb \u2261\n(4)\nH2 =\n2\n2\n3MP\n2 3MP\n3MP2\nwhere\n\n3\nm2 MP2\nb2 MP2\nF (b, V ) =\n2+\nlog\n2\nV\nV\n!\n!\nm2\nb2 MP2\n1\n1 + 2 exp \u22123\n.\n\u2212\n2\nb\nV\n!\n\n!\n\n(5)\n\nThe scale at which the quantum nature of the nonlocal entanglement becomes powerful is\ngiven by something known as the interference length L1 , derived in [12]. This length can\nalso be derived from the modification term F (b, V ).\nThe traces of these modifications on LSS and CMB, due to the nonlocal entanglement,\nderived in [12, 13] agree with the data from WMAP [26] and Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) [24] experiments so far.For example, besides the void, the measurements for the\namplitude of perturbation \u03c38 by WMAP up to a few months ago, [25], were in the range\nof values \u03c38 \u2243 1, a value that was expected from inflationary scenarios. But the recently\nobserved \u03c38 by the 5-year WMAP run [26] measures a suppressed value for the amplitude\nof fluctuations by a 30 percent, \u03c38 \u2243 0.8 in perfect agreement with our prediction for the\nsuppressed amplitude of perturbations [13].\nBut these modifications do depend sensitively on the second fundamental scale, that of\nSUSY breaking scale in our universe 'b'. We dont know what the SUSY breaking scale is\nor at what energy scale inflation started. However it is clear that the modification term\nF (b, V ), which depends on \u2032 b\u2032 was not strong enough to destroy the smoothness of the inflation potential energy (otherwise inflation would not have occured) for our survivor universe.\nSuch a requirement introduces a lower bound on the strength of the modification and therefore on the SUSY breaking scale. On the other hand, through our CMB experiments that\nmeasure the effect of the entanglement channel on the inhomogeneities in the CMB,it is\nconstrained to be of order O[10\u22125] up to distances a hundred times larger than our present\nhorizon size lH = H0\u22121 . The latter observational constraint introduces an upper bound on\nthe modification term and therefore the parameter b. A prediction of this theory, that will\nbe tested by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN soon, is that the SUSY breaking\nscale is bound by\nV\nb2\n<\n< 10\u22125\n(6)\nMp4\nm2\nWe dont know at what energy scale V inflation started. If our universe started with\nGUT scale inflation then the bounds on SUSY breaking scale for our universe are,\n10\u221210 MP < b < 10\u22128 MP\n10\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhich is a few orders of magnitude larger than the bounds expected by particle physics.\nThese bounds will soon be tested by LHC at CERN and they can provide us with information on the energy scale V of inflation.\nSo far I have advocated the need for extending our physical theories within the framework of a multiverse and made use of the string theory landscape as a working model for\na physical multiverse. The multiverse field is becoming an important new direction of research in physics. But there are other types of multiverses besides the landscape multiverse.\nWhile the above approach can be applied to any type once its structure is known, physical\nreality can not correspond to more than one multiverse, or else we have simply shifted the\nmystery of the selection of our initial state to a bigger mystery, that of the selection of the\nmultiverse. So, what is the Multiverse? In what spacetime does it exist? Little is known\nso far about this field. In the first part of my work, I dealt with a particular example, the\nstring theory multiverse while 'brushing under the rug' key issues about the ontology of the\nmultiverse, since the primary focus was on the puzzle of the selection of our initial state.\nI will now return to the topic of the basic questions about the structure and ontology of\ngeneric multiverses, that I ignored above.\n\n4\n\nMultiverse Theories\n\nThree of our fundamental and most successful theories predict the existence of a multiverse.\nThey are Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and the theory of Inflation, briefly described\nbelow. Currently the multiverse field is experiencing a renewal of interest and investigation.\nAs I have argued recently, this may be due to the fact that the emergence of a multiverse\nfrom theories of nature is not a coincidence. Rather, predicting a multiverse may prove to\nbecome a requirement for the theory of quantum gravity. The motivation for defining the\nmultiverse, along with the argument for needing to extend our conceptual framework to\ninclude the multiverse are discussed in Sec.5. In Sec.6, I conjecture the application of two\nprinciples in the multiverse that could help us define and investigate important questions\nfor its ontology as well as providing a handle for testable predictions. Known theoretical\nexamples of multiverses at present are: The Everett, Eternal Inflation, and, String Theory\nLandscape multiverses.\n\n4.1\n\nEverett Multiverse\n\nIn the late 1950's Hugh Everett III gave his many worlds interpretation of Quantum\nMechanics according to which, in the family of wavefunctions obtained from solving the\nSchrodinger equation, each wavefunction corresponds to a perfectly good physical reality\n(world). The Everett interpretation of Quantum Mechanics was complemented in the 1970's\nby H. Dieter Zeh [19] and Wojciech Zurek [20] who showed that the emergence of a classical\nworld from the quantum wavefunction is achieved via a mechanism known as decoherence.\nSince then, the latter has been tested experimentally. The Everett multiverse, although\ndebated for over 50 years, did provide the first scientific example of a multiverse being\npredicted from an underlying physical theory.\n11\n\n\f4.2\n\nEternal Inflation Multiverse\n\nThe paradigm of inflation has been tremendously successful in explaining many of the\nobserved features in our universe, such as flatness, homogeneity, structure and the scaleinvariance of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as being in nearly perfect\nagreement with the current observations so far [26]. It should be noted however that\ninflation comes with a heavy price tag by creating a set of new puzzles, such as: why\nour universe started with such improbable initial conditions; why was the initial patch\nso smoothly fine-tuned; and, what is the inflaton? Some of these puzzles may appear\nless severe in the framework of eternal inflation. Current thinking has it that in many of\nthe inflation models, eternal inflation is generic, i.e. once inflation starts it never entirely\nswitches off. In every Hubble time during inflation, the volume of the inflating domain\n(Hubble volume) increases about 20 times. There is a nonzero probability that one of the\ndomains, in the twenty newly created ones during one Hubble time, randomly ends up\nwith a large enough fluctuation that can start inflation in that region, thereby producing\na new bubble universe [28]. The conditions for such a large fluctuation to occur seem\nto be plausible for most inflationary models, thus etern inflation appears to be a generic\nprediction of the inflationary paradigm. This process of creating new bubbles via random\nlarge fluctuations, can continue ad infinitum into the future [28], giving rise to an ensemble\nof bubble universes. If the universe continually reproduces new ones then the ensemble\nof all these bubbles provides a multiverse predicted by eternal inflation. The problem\nof the probability distribution of these bubbles in the eternal multiverse, known as the\nmeasure problem, remains an open issue. The weight assigned to the likelihood of having\nsuch large fluctuations and therefore eternal inflation, have been recently challenged and\ndebated [29, 30].\n\n4.3\n\nString Landscape Multiverse\n\nAdvances in String Theory over the last five years led to the discovery of the landscape\nof string theory [6, 10, 11, 9]. String theorists discovered that after reducing from higher\ndimensions to (3 + 1) \u2212 D worlds, they did not end up with one unique solution but rather\nsomething like 10500 vacua solutions, the energy profile of which comprises the landscape.\nWork along this direction continues and it is possible that the number of string vacua\nsolutions on the landscape, that contain (3 + 1) \u2212 D worlds like our universe, will grow.\nIn 2005, I proposed to view the ensemble of landscape vacua solutions as the string theory\nmultiverse [3, 1] and argued that, since every vacua on the landscape is a potential birth\nplace for a universe like ours, then the ensemble of these vacua is to be interpreted as\na multiverse prediction of string theory [3, 1, 2, 4]. An equivalent interpretation of the\nabove proposal is to consider the string theory multiverse during its quantum phase, to\nbe the physical phase space for the initial conditions [1, 2, 4, 5]. By proposing to place\nthe wavefunction of the universe on the landscape and use its many-worlds interpretation\n[1, 2, 3], the quantum mechanics multiverse was thus embedded onto the string landscape,\nthereby making the Everett and Landscape multiverses equivalent [3, 4, 5].\n\n12\n\n\f5\n\nWhy do we need to live in a Multiverse?\n\nBreakthroughs in observational astrophysics have led us to an intriguing picture of the\nuniverse by challenging our previous understanding and expectations of nature.\nTen years ago we discovered that our universe is accelerating again, just like during\nthe Big Bang inflation, but at lower energies. The acceleration is attributed to the most\nmysterious form of energy, dark energy. Since then, many other anomalies in the CMB\nhave been spotted at the largest scales, scales compared to the horizon size. Such a lack of\nunderstanding of the present universe thus pushes the mystery of the selection of the initial\nconditions and inflation into the forefront of research.\nNaturally we expect that a deeper understanding of the mysteries of the birth of our\nuniverse and of its current acceleration, would stem from the theory of quantum gravity.\nBut breakthroughs in the leading candidate for quantum gravity, string theory, led to a\ndiscovery of the landscape that is still considered by many to be a bizarre picture. The\ngeneral view was that the multitude of vacua discovered presents a problem since we had\nexpected that string theory would yield one unique solution corresponding to a universe\nthat: started with high energy inflation; contained the correct values for the constants of\nnature; and, contained a tiny but nonzero amount of dark energy tuned exquisitely to 122\norders of magnitude, which was just right for dominating the expansion of the universe\nat recent times. But string theory does not predict a unique universe, on the contrary, it\npredicts a multiverse!\nA radically different point of view was advocated in [3, 4, 5], namely: if we are (even\nallowed) to ask these deep questions about the selection of our universe then a multiverse\npicture must be an expected prediction for the theory of quantum gravity. How else can we\nmeaningfully ask: why did we start with such an extremely improbable universe without\nimplying as compared to what other possibilites? Basically, a statement about an extraordinarily improbable event carries meaning only if we accept that other more probable events\ncan be conceived. In this context then, the problem of the selection of the initial conditions implies that an extension of our theories to the multiverse framework is neither a\nphilosophical contemplation, nor an unfortunate coincidence among our cherished theories,\nbut could be a physical reality that is required in order to gain a deeper understanding of\nnature.\nIn fact, the extension of our current cosmology to a multiverse framework is an extension\nof the Copernician Principle to nature. Over the ages we found that we are not at the center\nof our solar system, that the solar system is not at the center of the universe and now, that\nthe universe is not at the center of the world (the multiverse).\n\n6\n\nWhat is the Multiverse: How Many Types are there?\n\nIf nature provided us with a multiverse, then a discussion of the ontology of the multiverse and the potential for extracting testable predictions, becomes of central importance\nin cosmology. Let us assume that the emergence of the background spacetime(s) has al13\n\n\fready been addressed by the underlying theory of quantum gravity, which also predicts\nthe multiverse. Often in literature [31, 32, 33] the term 'multiverse' is often informally\nused to denote any multitude of universes. But by now we need a detailed discussion of\nissues such as their spacetime background, the relation between the different species, and\nultimately their observational imprints. As described in Sec.1 we have already come across\nthree seemingly unrelated examples of a multiverse. They can not all correspond to the\nsame physical reality unless they are identical, because if they are distinguishable than we\nhave simply transfered the puzzle of the selection of the initial conditions for our universe\nto a new puzzle, the selection of the 'real' multiverse. Thus the main question becomes:\nwhat is the multiverse, how many distinguishable species are there and, in what spacetime\ndoes the multiverse reside?\nLet us define the 'multiverse' to be the ensemble of all possible universes predicted by\nthe underlying theory. For the sake of definiteness in terminology, consider the' universe'\nto be (conservatively) defined as the domain of spacetime in which points were causally\nconnected at some time slice, say t = 0, of their past light cones. In an influential paper\nin 2003 [31] Max Tegmark classified the multiverses into four levels, (see also [34]). Since\nthen, as already discussed in Section 1, advances in string theory and precision cosmology\nhave provided a wealth of information and, possibly observational imprints [12, 13, 23, 26,\n25] relevant to the multiverse. The previous discussion on the number of distinguishable\nmultiverse species, their background space and the parameter of time can be viewed as\nan analysis of a multiverse corresponding to Tegmark's level 4, (since his levels 1, 2, 3\nare subsets of level 4), but with the addition of a new ingredient, namely the dynamics.\nThus the correspondence of Level 4 with the previous analysis is related to physical rather\nthan intrepretational properties, in that the 'Multiverse' should be understood in terms\nof the structural hierarchy of Tegmark's Level 4 that embeds all other types of multiverse\nlevels within its domain. However the difference between the two definitions lies in the\nintrepretation of whether this embedding space is a physical or a mathematical entity.\nWhile I totally agree with Tegmark's view, (often referred to as a platonic view), that\nthe physical existence of all mathematical solutions should be taken seriously, I would add\ndynamics as a new measure for weighting the mathematical solutions in this intrepretation.\nThis means that only that subset of the initial mathematical entity which carries a dynamic\ndescription can be promoted to the multiverse corresponding to physical reality. I am thus\nproposing that we consider only multiverses that are equipped with a set of laws that allow\ntheir dynamical description, as candidates for the correspondence to physical reality, for\nthe following reason: if this system has no dynamical evolution and description then its\nparameter of time becomes redundant. In this case a discussion of a background spacetime\nfor the multiverse, or of our universe being part of it, do not carry any meaning. As we\nhave seen, ignoring dynamics can prove quite dangerous in producing a set of paradoxes\nsimilar to those discussed in Section 1 \u2212 4 since the dynamics of the system, described by\nits own set of laws, is highly important in assigning and describing the physical properties\nof the system. A discussion of these physical properties and the background spacetime\nof a multiverse, which is the scope of the present study, can not be done within a static\nframework. Therefore, even if our starting point for a potential multiverse model is a\nmathematical structure, once we discover the dynamical laws of this entity and are able to\n14\n\n\fprovide a background spacetime framework, then the multiverse has been promoted to a\nphysical entity.\nIt is therefore important to provide now a set of rules and an agreed taxonomy for the\nemerging field of multiverse physics. For simplicity let us discuss separately the different\nspecies of multiverses comprised from (3+1)\u2212D universes, and the types based on ensembles\nof universes with varying dimensionality. Within the multiverse, each domain can have:\nA) its own set of laws;\nB) its own set of constants of nature; or,\nC) its own dimensionality\nthat vary from one domain to the next across the multiverse.\nIf our notion of a quantum to classical transition holds generically for some of the\ncategories above, then just like the universe members, we can further fine-split the above\nmultiverse species to two phases of existence, the quantum phase and the classical phase.\nThe quantum multiverse is the phase space of the initial conditions for all members of the\nensemble living in configuration space, whereas the classical multiverse is the ensemble of\nall the classical universes, embedded in a spacetime background, which are born from the\nquantum phase after the quantum to classical transition occurs, (perhaps similar to the\nphenomenon of decoherence for our universe). It is possible that at some stage a mixed\nphase of quantum and classical universes may co-exist in the multiverse. I will focus only\non the pure phases before the transition switches on and after the quantum to classical\ntransition has been completed throughout the multiverse, and discuss below in a bit more\ndetail the amount of information that can be extracted for each of the species (A, B, C),\nand in particular, the issue of the background space and time.\n\n6.1\n\n(Type A): Different laws across the Multiverse\n\nIn the type A multiverse, by definition if we use the set of laws and equations that comprise\nour physical theories, we can not make predictions about the other domains since their\nphysical laws are unknown to us and our theories are not relevant to them. These domains\nare beyond the realm of our understanding at present.\nWhat is time in the multiverse? Do we have the gravitational force in common with\nthe other domains? Can gravitons from our domain leak across into the other sectors of\nthe multiverse? Many such issues remain open at present. Even if the answers to the\nlatter question is yes which implies potential for observational imprints in our universe,\nwe would still lack the computational power for making those predictions. It is possible\nthat the multiverse predicted by eternal inflation may fall into the type A category with\neach bubble having its own spacetime, set of laws and maybe even different dimensionality.\nSince those laws are unknown to us and we lack an embedding theory for describing the\nvarying laws of the bubbles ensemble, then the severe difficulties with the measure problem\nmay be due to conceptual rather than technical issues.\n\n15\n\n\f6.2\n\n(Type B): Same laws but different constants of nature across\nthe Multiverse\n\nIn the type B multiverse, there definitely exists a force of gravity in all the domains since\nthe laws and equations are the same as ours across this multiverse. In type B gravity\ncan spread everywhere and thus correlations among different domains do exist. In type B\nmultiverses we have the potential to make predictions about domains beyond our causal\nhorizon. The Everett multiverse and the string theory landscape multiverse may be two\nsuch example of the type B multiverses, since in both cases there is an overall embedding\ntheory from which the (3+1)-D members of the ensemble (solutions) are derived, and which\nare closely related to each-other [3, 4, 1, 2].\n\n6.3\n\n(Type C ): Varying dimensionality Multiverse\n\nThis multiverse is the ensemble of universes comprised from domains have different dimensions. In general, any subset of Type C that contain (N + 1) \u2212 D universes, (N > 3), can\nbe further be branched in the two groups AN and B N where AN , B N , correspond to the\ntypes A, B defined above but in space dimensions N > 3. This division is possible only\nif the parameter of time is fundamental in the type C multiverse. This argument makes\nit plausible for Type A and Type B multiverses to be sectors in the parent multiverse of\nType C since they could correspond to the sector of C with N = 3, where the higher N\ndimensional branches are stacked above.\nClearly a knowledge of what is time in the C multiverse is crucial for its understanding\nand its relevance to our sector N = 3. Yet, since currently we lack a deeper understanding of this challenging issue, below I would like to propose that we apply the 'Principle\nof No Perpetum Mobile' for all multiverse species in order to achieve consistency in our\nguesstimates for their basic characteristics and embbedding spacetime.\n\n6.4\n\nIs Time in the Multiverse Fundamental or Emergent?\nThe Principle of 'No Perpetual Motion'\n\nUnderstanding the nature of time is another central mystery in theoretical physics. We\nhave seen in Sec.2 that the question: is time fundamental or emergent, becomes crucially\nimportant to the multiverse physics.\nIn Type A multiverses it is possible to allow for time to emerge since the laws of physics\nvary across the multiverse. Specifically we can think of a Schrodinger equation which relates\nthe parameter of time to the energy level of the wavefunction. If this equation is not valid for\nthe whole ensemble then it is not difficult to envision a scenario where the parameter of time\nappears differently in various domains since it emerges from their different corresponding\ntheories. We could also imagine that time acquires different meanings in different domains.\nIn such a scenario it is plausible that the parameter of time may not appear as a fundamental\nquantity. This question becomes more severe for the type C multiverse.\nIn Type B multiverses, since the laws of nature are the same everywhere, then the\n16\n\n\fdefinition of the time parameter would also be the same. In this type, the existence of time\nas a fundamental property of nature appears to be the more plausible scenario.\nAlthough there is no agreement yet on the issue of time being emergent or fundamental[35],\nit is clear that the nature of time and the multiverse are closely inter-related. Understanding\none of these fundamental questions will shed light on the other and vice-versa. Even though\nthese problems remain open, based on the known symmetries and basic categorization of\nthe multiverses, we can still derive some general statements about the parameter of time in\nthe multiverse if we make the assumption that quantum mechanics is not an effective but\na universal theory. If time translation is a symmetry of the multiverse (type A, B or C)\nand the time-energy relation holds, then energy conservation resulting from this symmetry,\nimplies that 'no perpetual motion' is allowed across the multiverse. At this stage of our\nknowledge we can not derive this conclusion since we don't know if the relation between\ntime translation symmetry and energy conservation holds.\nTherefore I would like to propose that we impose the The Principle of No Perpetual\nMotion in the Multiverse, which requires that,(even if energy can be transferred), the energy\ncan not be created or destroyed in or across domains in the multiverse. A by-product of\nthis principle is to reduce the number of multiverse species that are candidates for physical\nreality to only those where the parameter of time does not vary across the multiverse, and\nis likely to be fundamental. This principle could reduce the number of possible multiverses\ncorresponding to physical reality, to only those where the parameter of time is the same\nfor all the domains, and possibly to narrow down the candidates to solely the multiverse\nwhere time appears fundamental.\n\n7\n\nIn what spacetime does the Multiverse exists?\nThe Principle of 'Domains Correlations'\n\nGiven that only one of the multiverses described above corresponds to the physical reality,\nand assuming that, independent of the space dimensionality, based on the principle of 'no\nperpetual motion', there is only one time parameter in that multiverse, then a crucial\nquestion is: In what background spacetime does the multiverse exist?\nThis simple question is poorly understood at present. I would like to propose that we use\nthe 'Principle of Domains Correlations' in the multiverse as our criterion for determining\nthe background spacetime(s) in which the multiverse exists. According to this principle\nthe existence of correlations among domains in the multiverse determines the background\nspacetime(s) on which the multiverse resides. Thereby the multiverse species fall in two\nbroad distinguishable categories, connected and disconnected as follows:\nConnected: If different domains in the multiverse are correlated then they must exist\nin the same background spacetime.\nDisconnected: If there are no correlations among domains in the multiverse, i.e. domains are totally disconnected from each other, then they must exist in different background\nspacetimes.\n17\n\n\fThe type C multiverse could provide an illustration of the Disconnected category unless\nthe dimensionally different universes can all be embedded into a higher dimensional space\ninto which correlations are carried via bulk space, as is the case in some brane-world scenarios [36] where gravitons spread in the bulk. If this is the case, then we have an example of a\nmultiverse which 'lives' in higher dimensional space where these correlations exist although\nits member ('brane') universes belong to a lower space dimensionality.\nThe Connected Multiverse is the most interesting type, not only because it provides\none embedding background space and observational handles but also because we have good\nindications, through CMB, that our universe may be a domain in one such type of the\nmultiverse. Such was the case of the string theory multiverse discussed in [12, 13, 23]).\nAs wasn shown in [12, 13] connectivity through the nonlocal entanglement of our domain\nwith everything else on the multiverse left its imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS), in various observables. Among them, it\nis worth mentioning: the prediction of a giant void [12] whose existence was later confirmed experimentally[23]; a suppressed \u03c38 but an enhanced power with distinct signatures\nat higher multipoles in the power spectrum which is in agreement with the latest WMAP\ndata release[26]; and, a higher SUSY breaking scale which will be tested this year by\nLHC. Thus the connected multiverse has the potential for providing observational clues.\nThe Everett and Landscape multiverses, and in general the Type B predictions fall under\nthe 'Connected Multiverse' category. If time is fundamental then a hierarchy of multiverses\nis possible with the Disconnected Multiverse type being the embedding space of all different\nsectors, such that Type B is a sector of Type A, and type B and A are subsets of the larger\nmultiverse, type C.\nThe pressing question related to the variety of multiverse species investigated here is:\nwhich one of them is real? This question stands on shaky foundations since it can be\nanswered only if we could define what constitutes physical reality. Although such definition\ndoes not yet exist, we all share the common notion that the existence of spacetime is part\nof the physical reality and that there can be but one reality. But having only one physical\nreality implies that only one of the multiverses can correspond to that physical reality.\nFollowing this argument seems to place the Disconnected multiverse at a disadvantage.\nThe lack of correlations among domains and the separate existence of sectors in different\nspacetimes means that there is no way or need for us to ever be aware of the other sectors\nexistence in which case, for all relevance purposes, they are not part of our physical reality.\nIf nature is economical then there is no need for the Disconnected type which would make\ntheir existence unlikely. For the case of Connected universes, due to the unitarity principle,\nthose correlations will continue to exist at all times and all the sectors of this multiverse\nshare the same background spacetime. Therefore all parts of the Connected multiverse\nare relevant parts of reality for all times, which could make them a better candidate for\ndescribing nature.\nMany of the issues discussed here raise more questions than provide answers. Yet we\nare on the first steps [31, 3, 4, 5] towards addressing a major problem, the ontology of the\nmultiverse, that deserves deeper investigation.\n\n18\n\n\f8\n\nThoughts on Defining the Multiverse\n\nExtending our physical theories to a multiverse framework may prove to be not only a neccesity for our understanding but also a fertile direction for exploring fundamental questions\nabout or universe and nature. Progress in this field requires that by now we lay a set of\nprinciples and ground rules for discussing space and time in the multiverse and, ultimately\nreduce the class of candidates corresponding to physical reality to only one multiverse.\nIn this note I have proposed to apply two principles, that to my opinion, are required to\ndiscuss issues of space and time in which the classical multiverse is embedded and in which\nit is assumed that quantum mechanics is a universal theory. The proposed principles for\nthe multiverse are:\n- the principle of 'No Perpetual Motion', which states that energy can not be created or\ndestroyed in the multiverse; and,\n- the principle of 'Domains Correlations' which states that if correlations among domains\nin the multiverse exists that there is only one corresponding spacetime for all universes.\nTogether these two principles help determine the background spacetime on which the\nmultiverse is embedded. Further, a possible existence of two phases, the quantum phase and\nthe classical phase for the multiverse allows us to have a coherent picture for the member\nuniverses as they go through a quantum to classical transition and a dual picture in quantum\nHilbert space and in real spacetime for the multiverse. These phases also allow us to discuss\nissues such as ergodicity of the phase space for the quantum multiverse and the possibility of\nPoincarre recurrences that in principle could continually create duplicates of each member\nuniverse.The phase space is defined as the ensemble of all the initial states, with each 'point'\nthere representing the initial state of a possible universe. An ergodic phase space is one\nin which the volume of that space does not shrink. Just like an incompressable fluid, each\n'point' on this phase space of initial conditions, our quantum multiverse, can flow along a\ntrajectory. But as long as the total phase space remains incompressable, i.e. ergodic, this\ntrajectory remains within the boundaries of the volume allowed to it. This means that if we\nwait long enough, the' point' will return to where it started, completing a Poincarre cycle\nand giving rise to a recurrence of the old state. But as was shown in [4, 5] an ergodic phase\nspace for the quantum multiverse is highly unlikely due to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics\nof the degrees of freedom of each domain wipes out which much of the initial states in\nthe phase space, thereby shrinking the volume to a subset of the original phase space, to\nthe subspace corresponding to the 'survivor' universes 'points'. Since Poincarre recurrences\nare a consequence of ergodicity and the ergodicity of the phase space is broken then there\nis no danger that the universe could fluctuate back close enough to its previous state\n(thereby producing duplicates) no matter how long we wait for these Poincarre recurrences\nto occur[5]. Dynamics does not allow temporary or eternal 'duplications'.\nThis paper attempts to touch upon some basic issues related to defining the multiverse\nand its correspondence to physical reality. Although more than 50 years have elapsed since\nthe first discussion of the 'many worlds' by Everett, we are in the process of resuming the\nfirst steps in setting the foundations and the ontology of the multiverse and of this new field\n\n19\n\n\fin physics. In order to move forward at this relatively early stage in the field, we need to be\nclear on our set of principles and definitions, hence the need to open the discussion. Who\nwould have though that Nature would lead us to a situation where a deeper understanding\nof its mysteries, at the smallest and largest scales, would guide the extension of our physical\ntheories towards the realm of the multiverse?\n\n9\n\nAppendix: Voids and the ISW effect\n\nHumans perform observations by receiving light signals. But light has to travel through\nthe vast structures in the universe before reaching earth. These structures produce a gravitational field, with the field lines mapped by the Newtonian gravitational potential of\nstructure, \u03a6, as described in the text. Gravitational fields near superdense regions are\nstrong and their lines are represented by deep 'wells' in \u03a6, while the field is weak near the\nunderdense regions and are represented by 'barriers' in the gravitational potential. Light\nemitted from an overdense region in the sky shows up as a hot spot in the primary CMB\nskymaps, and light from an underdense region shows up as a cold spot. But \u03a6 changes with\ntime due to the different energy components dominating the universe at various epochs,\n(except for the case when matter dominates the expansion). As light propagates through\nthese changing structures in the universe, it can not escape the gravitational interaction\nwith \u03a6, an interaction which changes the energy of the photons.\nInformation on the time-dependent potential of structures is contained in the (latetimes) Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect which provides a modification to the CMB\nspectrum, that is subdominant relative to the primary CMB spectrum. The ISW effect\ntakes into account the total of the energy changes in the photons propagating through the\ntime-dependent \u03a6, from the (relatively late) time since the surface of the last scattering,\n(corresponding to about 1 degree of the sky today,) to present time. When photons climb\nup and down deep potential wells then we receive a suppressed signal since it is harder for\nthe photons to reach us, thus the signal is 'dampened' by such deep wells; when photons go\nthrough highly underdense or empty regions then there is no obstacle in their way thus the\nsignal we receive is enhanced. But recently the universe has been dominated by dark energy.\nDark energy makes the potential wells shallower by 'stretching' the fabric of spacetime.\nTherefore, due to the nonlinear ISW effect, we should observe an enhancement of the light\nsignals reaching us, which is a consequence of the decay of the gravitational potential of\nlarge scale structure in the universe induced by dark energy. The signal is enhanced relative\nto the signal we would have received if the universe was matter dominated instead of dark\nenergy dominated. For this reason and our knowledge of structure distribution, a detection\nof the ISW enhancement, (already observed by SDSS [24]) is taken as evidence of dark\nenergy.\nBut we should bear in mind that, although evidence for dark energy detection can\nbe inferred from the ISW effect, this effect only measures enhancement or suppression of\nsignals due to their propagation through the wells and barriers of \u03a6. Therefore, the ISW\neffect provides 'direct' information only on the time-dependent profile of \u03a6 and not on\nthe factors that induce changes in this potential. A decaying \u03a6 profile can be induced by\n20\n\n\fthe accelerated expansion which dilutes matter density, or be assigned to the existence of\nsupervoids, or both. A void, (which shows up as a cold spot in the primary CMB [25]), by\ndefinition is a region of very low matter density and therefore, any signal received from the\nvoid region will be enhanced - and not suppressed - due to the ISW effect. One example of a\ngiant void was observed in 2007 [23], of about 12 degrees in size and at a distance of about 8\nbillion lightyears away, for which signals received should be enhanced from the ISW effect.\nBut the CMB temperature observations [26, 25] show a suppression of the signal at large\ndistances, such as those of the void. This observation recently has given rise to a confusing\nintrepretation that the void [23] could be explained by the ISW effect by postulating that\nthe suppresion of the CMB spectrum could be explained as a detection of the void's ISW\neffect. Au contraire, the ISW effect enhances the signal from voids. If we consider that\nthe dominant component in our universe is dark energy and that the giant void exists,\nthen the combined ISW signal enhancements from both dark energy and the giant void,\nare in fact incompatible with the observed suppressed signal of temperature anisotropies\nat large scales [26, 25]. The combination of dark energy and the void, should show up as a\nlarger than expected ISW enhancement, (an enhancement interestingly noticed in the data\nanalysis of [37]). In short, a suppression of the signal at large scales due to the ISW effect\ndoes not provide an explanation for the void [23], but rather makes the existence of giant\nvoids even more unlikely and more difficult to explain.\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nLMH was suported in part by DOE grant DE-FG02-06ER41418, NSF grant PHY-0553312\nand a FQXI grant.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
