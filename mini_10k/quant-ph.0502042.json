The basic\napproach is to encode a qubit in such a way that any\nerrors can be identified and corrected without measuring\nthe value of the qubit itself [1, 2]. Various QEC protocols\nhave recently been demonstrated in NMR [3, 4, 5] and\nion-trap [6] approaches to quantum computing. In linear optics quantum computing (LOQC), the most common error consists of a measurement of the value of a\nqubit, which can occur during quantum logic operations\n[7]. Measurement errors of that kind can be corrected using two-qubit encoding combined with fast feed-forward\ncontrol [7]. Several encoding [8, 9, 10] and feed-forward\nexperiments [11, 12, 13, 14] have recently been reported.\nIn this paper we combine these two techniques to demonstrate QEC for measurement errors in LOQC.\nIn LOQC, failures in the probabilistic logic gates correspond to situations in which the value of a singlephoton qubit is measured in the computations basis (a\nZ-measurement) [7]. The same situation applies to the\nrecent Zeno gate approach as well [15]. However, these\nintrinsic measurement errors can be corrected by using\nthe following two-qubit encoding [7, 10]:\n\nin the value 1, the state of the remaining photon corresponds to the bit-flipped value of the initial qubit. In\nthis latter case, a fast feed-forward-controlled bit-flip is\nused to restore the original qubit value.\nA quantum circuit diagram [1] illustrating this encoding and feed-forward-control is shown in Figure 1. A\nsingle-photon qubit in an arbitrary state |\u03c8i and an ancilla photon in the state |0i are sent into an encoding device which produces the two-photon logical qubit |\u03c8L i.\nIf an unwanted Z-measurement M1 occurs on bit 1, and\nthe value 1 (or 0) is found, the state of the photon in the\nlower path is bit-flipped (or left alone) to recover the original qubit |\u03c8i. The same procedure is used to recover |\u03c8i\nin the event of a measurement M2 on bit 2 [16]. In either\ncase, the two-photon logical qubit |\u03c8L i can be recovered\nby regenerating a new ancilla photon and repeating the\nencoding process.\nIn our demonstration of the QEC technique of Figure\n1, the qubit |\u03c8i and ancilla state |0i were represented\nby the polarization states of two single-photons from a\nparametric down-conversion pair.

The value of the logical\nqubit corresponds to the parity of the two physical qubits.\nThe same encoding must also be applied to superposition\nstates.\nFrom equations (1) it can be seen that if a Zmeasurement occurs on either of the two photons, and\nthe value 0 is found, the state of the remaining photon\nsimply corresponds to that of the initial single-photon\nqubit. On the other hand, if the Z-measurement results\n\n0\n\nH\n\nX\n\nX\nM2\n\n(ancilla)\n\nFIG. 1: Quantum circuit diagram [1] illustrating protection\nand recovery from a Z-measurement error in LOQC [7]. An\nancilla photon and encoding operation are used to convert\na single-photon qubit |\u03c8i into the two-photon logical qubit\n|\u03c8L i according to equation (1). The dashed-boxes M1 and\nM2 symbolize Z-measurements which may or may not occur.\nIf one does occur, and returns the value 1, a bit-flip (X) is\napplied using feed-forward control. This procedure recovers\nthe initial qubit |\u03c8i. If needed, the logical qubit |\u03c8L i can\nthen be regenerated by supplying a new ancilla photon and\nrepeating the encoding operation.\n\n\f2\n\nA qubit photon in an arbitrary state |\u03c8i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i\nis sent into one of the input ports of of the PBS, while the\nancilla photon (in fixed state |0i) is sent into the second\ninput port of the PBS. Provided that one photon exits\neach output port, it can be shown that the two-qubit\ncode of equation (1) is achieved:\n\nERROR CORRECTION EXPERIMENT\n\nAn overview of the QEC experiment is shown in Figure 2. The shaded areas are used to relate several key aspects of the apparatus to the quantum circuit diagram of\nFigure 1: qubit |\u03c8i preparation, the encoding device described in section II, a Z-measurement with feed-forward\ncontrol, and qubit analysis to verify the QEC procedure.\nA type-I down-conversion source (PDC) produced\npairs of horizontally polarized photons at 780nm that\nwere used as the qubit and ancilla (source details can be\nfound in [8]). A half-wave plate (HWP2) was used to fix\nthe polarization state of the ancilla photon at 45o (logical\n|0i), while a rotatable half-wave plate (HWP1) could be\nused to prepare different linear polarization qubit states\n|\u03c8i.\nThe qubit and ancilla photons were injected into a\nsingle-mode fiber-coupled PBS for the encoding. For a\ngeneral qubit value |\u03c8i, the encoding operation can essentially be understood as a two-photon quantum interference effect that uses a beam splitter and post-selection\nto generate polarization entanglement (in the coincidence\nbasis) from an initial product state of two single photons [21]. This required the photons to arrive at the\nPBS within a time defined by their coherence lengths,\nand alignment of the encoder involved optimizing various polarization-dependent Hong-Ou-Mandel-type quantum interference effects [22].

In principle, operations of this kind can\nbe performed near-deterministically in LOQC by incorporating large numbers of additional photons and very\nhigh-efficiency detectors [7].\nFor laboratory demonstrations, however, these requirements can be greatly reduced by working in the so-called\n\"coincidence basis\", which utilizes destructive measurements to ensure that photons were actually present in the\ndesired optical paths [17]. In many cases, this simplification can be used to successfully demonstrate the essential\nfeatures of a two-qubit logic operation while overcoming\nthe effects of random photon sources, loss, and limited detector efficiency associated with current technology. For\nexample, a coincidence-basis photonic CNOT gate [18]\nwas recently used to demonstrate the encoding (and decoding) of equation (1) [10].\nThe encoding box of Figure 1 can be further simplified\nby exploiting the fact that the ancilla photon is always\nin the fixed state |0i. This allows one to use linear optics\nto construct a robust specific-purpose encoding device\nthat does not require the general functionality of a full\nCNOT gate. In our experiment with polarization qubits,\nthis encoding was done using a single polarizing beam\nsplitter (PBS). The use of a PBS to implement two-qubit\nlogic operations has been done in other contexts as well\n(see, for example, [19, 20]).\nA PBS is a four-port device that transmits horizontally polarized single photons (|Hi) and reflects vertically polarized single photons (|V i). We use the following polarization definitions for the computational basis:\n|0i \u2261 \u221a12 (|Hi + |V i) (a photon polarized at 45o ), and\n|1i \u2261 \u221a12 (|Hi \u2212 |V i) (a photon polarized at \u221245o ).\n\nIII.\n\nD3\n\n\"0\"\nD2\nZ-measurement\n\ncoincidence logic\n\nENCODING IN THE COINCIDENCE BASIS\n\nFor any qubit value |\u03c8i, the probability that one photon\nwill exit each output port is 12 . This can be viewed as the\nideal success probability of this probabilistic encoding device. In our experiment, coincidence basis measurements\nwere used to monitor only those cases in which that occurred.\n\nU\n\nII.\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i \u2192 \u221a (|00i + |11i) + \u221a (|01i + |10i) (2)\n2\n2\n\nU\n\nduce |\u03c8L i was done probabilistically using linear optics\nand post-selection, and the feed-forward-controlled bitflip was accomplished using an electro-optic polarization\nrotator (Pockels cell) triggered by the output of singlephoton detectors.\nThe basic idea of the experiment was to intentionally\ninflict a Z-measurement on one of the photons, and then\nverify the success of the QEC procedure by comparing the\ncorrected polarization state of the remaining output photon with the input state |\u03c8i. The subsequent repetition\nof the encoding operation to regenerate the two-photon\nlogical qubit |\u03c8L i was not included in this demonstration.\n\nFIG. 2: Apparatus used to demonstrate LOQC QEC. The\nshaded areas relate key aspects of the apparatus to the quantum circuit diagram of Figure 1. Details and symbols are\ndescribed in the text.\n\n\f3\nlogical qubit |\u03c8L i was directly related to the quality of\nthese two-photon interference effects. This, in turn, impacted the ability to recover the initial single qubit state\n|\u03c8i after a Z-measurement on one of these photons.\nFibers A and B containing the two-photon logical\nqubit |\u03c8L i were connected to fibers D and C which led,\nrespectively, to the Z-measurement device and to the\nfeed-forward-controlled bit-flip and output qubit analysis\nzone. As shown by the dashed arrows in the figure, these\nfiber connections could be easily swapped to make the\nconnections A:C and B:D, or A:D and B:C. This allowed\nus to make a Z-measurement on either of the photons\ncomprising the logical qubit |\u03c8L i, and then correct the\nstate of the remaining photon to recover |\u03c8i.\nThe Z-measurement was accomplished using a second fiber-coupled PBS. A fiber polarization controller\n(fpc) was used to rotate the alignment of the transmission/reflection axes of this PBS into the computational\nbasis. In this way, a photon with polarization corresponding to the state |1i would be transmitted by the PBS to\na single-photon detector D3 , while a photon with polarization corresponding to the state |0i would be reflected\nby the PBS to a single-photon detector D2 . All detectors were preceded by 10nm bandpass interference filters\ncentered at 780nm.\nThe feed-forward-controlled bit-flip was implemented\nusing a Pockels cell (PC) that was triggered only by the\noutput of detector D3 . Additional technical details about\nthis part of the experiment can be found in our earlier\nwork on feed-forward control [12]. Here the PC was oriented with its fast axis in the horizontal direction, so that\nthe application of a half-wave voltage pulse triggered by\nD3 would cause a bit-flip in the computational basis.\nBecause this feed-forward control process took roughly\n100 ns [12], a 30 m fiber delay line was used to delay the\noutput photon before entering the PC. The polarization\nstate of the corrected (or uncorrected) photons exiting\nthe PC were then measured using a rotatable polarization\nanalyzer \u03b8 and detector D1 . A coincidence logic circuit\nwas used to record only those events in which one photon was detected by the Z-measurement detectors, and\nthe second photon was detected by D1 . This enforced\nthe required coincidence-basis operation of the encoding\ndevice by rejecting those cases in which both photons of\na PDC pair exited the same port of the encoding PBS.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn practice, the demonstration of quantum error correction consisted of using HWP1 to specify a qubit value\n|\u03c8i, and then monitoring the coincidence counting rate\nbetween detectors D1 and D2 , or D1 and D3 , as a function of the analyzer angle \u03b8. The results obtained for\nseveral different examples of |\u03c8i are shown in Figure 3.\nFor the data shown in Figure 3(a), the HWP1 was used\nto prepare the qubit in the state |0i (a photon polarized\nat 45o ), and the fiber connections A:C and B:D were\n\nused.\nThe solid-circle data points show the number of D1 :\nD2 coincidence counts as a function of \u03b8. This corresponds to a Z-measurement returning the value 0. In\naccordance with equation (1), no correction is needed,\nand the output qubit is expected to be in the same state\nas the input |\u03c8i. The results agree with this prediction;\na Malus' law dependence on \u03b8 consistent with a linear\npolarization state of 45o is clearly seen. The solid line\nis a sinusoidal fit to the data points, with a visibility of\n(92.2 \u00b1 0.3)%. The data points obtained with the polarizer \u03b8 set to \u00b145o (corresponding to the qubits |0i and\n|1i) can be used to estimate a recovery of |\u03c8i = |0i from\nthe Z-measurement error with a fidelity of \u223c 98%.\nThe solid-square data points in Figure 3(a) show the\nnumber of D1 : D3 coincidence counts as a function of\n\u03b8. This corresponds to a Z-measurement resulting in the\nvalue 1, which requires a feed-forward controlled bit-flip\non the output qubit to recover |\u03c8i = |0i. Here, however,\nthe PC was intentionally disconnected so that no bit-flip\nwas applied. As expected, the data is indicative of an\noutput qubit |1i. In this example, the dashed line fit to\nthe data had a visibility of (92.5 \u00b1 0.3)%.\nThe solid-triangle data in Figure 3(a) correspond to\nthe same situation, but with the PC connected and the\nbit-flip applied. In this case the data clearly shows the\nrecovered qubit |\u03c8i = |0i. The dotted-line fit to this data\nhas a visibility of (92.1 \u00b1 0.3)%, indicating the ability\nto successfully apply the feed-forward-controlled bit-flip\nusing the PC.\nFrom an experimental point of view, a comparison of\nthe results in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) highlights the nonclassical nature of the encoding operation. The conditions were exactly the same for these two data sets, except that for (b) the qubit photon was delayed relative to\nthe ancilla photon by roughly twice its coherence length\nbefore entering the encoding PBS. This temporal information rendered the two photons distinguishable, which\ndestroyed the quantum interference effects necessary for\nsuccessful encoding [22]. The resulting flat lines in Figure\n3(b) are what would be expected from \"classical\" statistics in this case : roughly half of the photons emerging\nin fiber A were horizontally polarized, and the other half\nwere vertically polarized.\nThe data shown in Figure 3(c) corresponds to the conditions of Figure 3(a), except that the outputs of the\nencoding device were swapped by making the fiber connections A:D and B:C. The three sets of data are nearly\nidentical to those in Figure 3(a), which demonstrates the\nability of the two-qubit code (1) to recover from a Zmeasurement on either of the two photons comprising\nthe logical qubit |\u03c8L i.\nFor the data shown in Figures 3(d) and 3(e) the HWP1\nwas used to prepare input qubits |\u03c8i in the states |1i and\n\u221a1 (|0i + |1i). In both cases, the Malus' law dependence\n2\non \u03b8 agrees with the expected output states. Similar results were also obtained with the output fibers swapped.\nThe average visibility of the three fits in Figure 3(d) was\n\n\f4\n12000\n\n(b) qubit = 0 (no interference)\n\nCoincidenc Counts\n\n(a) qubit = 0\n\n6000\n3000\n0\n-90\n\n12000\nCoincidence Counts\n\n(c) qubit = 0 (outputs swapped)\n\n9000\n\n-45\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\n45\n\n(d) qubit = 1\n\n90\n\n-90\n\n-45\n\n(e) qubit =\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\n45\n\n90 -90\n\n-45\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\n45\n\n90\n\nKey\n\n1\n(0 + 1 )\n2\n\n9000\n\nCoinc.\n\nZ\n\nbit-flip\napplied\n\n6000\n\nD1:D2\n\n0\n\nno\n\nD1:D3\n\n1\n\nno\n\n3000\n\nD1:D3\n\n1\n\nyes\n\n0\n-90\n\n-45\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\n45\n\n90 -90\n\n-45\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\n45\n\n90\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental results of the QEC procedure for several different values of input qubits |\u03c8i. The data show the number\nof coincidence counts per 60 seconds as a function of the output qubit polarization analyzer \u03b8. The Key summarizes the\nexperimental conditions for the three sets of data shown in each plot. In (a),(c),(d), and (e) the lines are sinusoidal fits to the\ndata with an average visibility of 93.5%. The corrected qubit examples showed the ability to fully recover the qubit |\u03c8i from\na Z-measurement error with an estimated average fidelity of about 98%.\n\n93.6%, while it was 98.2% for Figure 3(e). The higher visibility in the latter case is due to the fact that the encoding operation does not depend on two-photon interference\neffects for the superposition state |\u03c8i = \u221a12 (|0i + |1i),\nwhich simply corresponds to a horizontally polarized photon. The slight deviation from 100% visibility in this case\ncan therefore be used to estimate the magnitude of the\nremaining technical errors in the experiment.\nThe average visibility of the nonclassical two-photon\ninterference patterns corresponding to the corrected\nqubits in Figures 3(a),(c),(d), and (e) was 93.6%; in\ncontrast, the visibilities in Figure 3(b) (with no quantum interference) were essentially zero. These examples\nclearly show the ability to recover the qubit |\u03c8i from a\nZ-measurement error.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of Figure 3 demonstrate the ability to combine two-qubit encoding and feed-forward control to recover from the Z-measurement errors intrinsic in proba-\n\n[1] Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, M.A.\nNielsen and I.L. Chuang, Cambridge University Press\n\nbilistic LOQC logic gates.\nWithin the coincidence basis, the two-qubit encoding\nof equation (1) can be accomplished using a photonic\nCNOT gate, as was first demonstrated in reference [10],\nor by using a specific purpose encoding device such as the\none constructed here. The required feed-forward control\nwas implemented here using real-time polarization rotations via the techniques of reference [12].\nAll of these preliminary studies have shown that intrinsic error correction is feasible in an LOQC approach.\nHowever, it should be noted that the two-qubit code and\nfeed-forward used here cannot correct for more general\nphysical errors such as bit-flips, phase-shifts, and loss.\nIn order to overcome errors of that kind, the procedure\ndemonstrated here would need to be embedded in a more\ngeneral QEC code [7]. The realization of these more\ncomplex codes, as well as operation outside the coincidence basis, will place significant demands on the photon\nsources and detectors.\nThis work was supported by ARO, ARDA, and IR&D\nfunding.\n\n(2000).\n[2] P.W.
