A fast transformation from the initial spatial anisotropy to the momentum\nanisotropy will indicate sufficiently strong interactions among quarks and gluons, which also\nprovides the reason for a fast thermalization to a QGP with a small shear viscosity. The\ngood agreements of the elliptic flow v2 data at RHIC [4, 5] with the results from calculations\nemploying ideal hydrodynamics [6] suggest that the shear viscosity of the QGP created\nat RHIC is small [7]. To find its lower and upper bound is an important but difficult\ntask, because the elliptic flow is built up not only during the evolution of the QGP but\nalso initially during the thermalization and finally, though possibly marginal, during the\nhadronic cascade before particles decouple kinetically. Moreover, the lack of understanding\nof the hadronization leads to an uncertainty in converting the partonic elliptic flow to the\nhadronic one that is measured. All these contributions to the final hadronic elliptic flow can,\nin principle, be investigated in a transport calculation including a partonic and a hadronic\ncascade and a hadronization mechanism [8]. Such studies will help to determine the true\nshear viscosity in the QGP phase.\nRecently, employing the perturbative QCD (pQCD) based parton cascade Boltzmann\nApproach of MultiParton Scatterings (BAMPS) [9, 10, 11], we have calculated the elliptic\nflow v2 of the gluon matter produced in Au+Au collisions at the RHIC energy [12]. To compare our results with the experimental data the gluonic v2 was converted to the hadronic one\nusing the parton-hadron duality picture at a freezeout energy density of ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 .\nHence v2pion (pT ) = v2gluon (pT ) at transverse momenta pT . Even though the hadronization was\ndescribed in such a simple manner, it was found that when employing a QCD coupling constant of \u03b1s = 0.6, the calculated v2 matches the experimental data [13, 14]. With \u03b1s = 0.3\nthe results are about 20% smaller than the data. Hence, pQCD interactions can explain\nthe large v2 buildup at RHIC. In addition, in Refs. [12] and [15] the shear viscosity to the\nentropy density ratio \u03b7/s from the transport calculations was extracted and it was found\nthat \u03b7/s is between 0.15 for \u03b1s = 0.3 and 0.08 for \u03b1s = 0.6. These findings are similar to\nthose obtained from viscous hydrodynamical calculations [16].\n2\n\n\fThis article provides details on our recent results on the elliptic flow from parton cascade\ncalculations. In Sec. II setups for numerical calculations are given. Section III shows the\nresults for the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow, v2 (pT ), the transverse\nmomentum spectra, the mean transverse momentum, and the final transverse energy per\nrapidity at midrapidity. The results from the BAMPS calculations are compared with the\nexperimental data at RHIC assuming parton-hadron duality. Further possible improvements\nas well as a discussion about possible hadronization scenarios via gluon fragmentation and\nquark recombination are given. In Sec. IV the dependence of the elliptic flow on the chosen freezeout energy density is presented, which indicates the uncertainty of the \u03b7/s ratio\nextracted from the BAMPS calculations. Finally we summarize in Sec. V. In Appendix A,\nthe calculation of the number of participating nucleons and the determination of centrality\nclasses are given.\n\nII.\n\nBAMPS SETUPS\n\nBAMPS solves the Boltzmann equation for on-shell gluons with pQCD interactions, which\ninclude elastic scatterings and bremsstrahlung and its backreaction. The cross section of\npQCD elastic scatterings is given by [9, 17, 18]\n9\u03c0\u03b1s2\nd\u03c3 gg\u2192gg\n=\n,\ndq2\u22a5\n(q2\u22a5 + m2D )2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q\u22a5 denotes the perpendicular component of the momentum transfer in the center-ofmass frame of the elastic collision.

The factor 1/2 before the integral indicates that\nthe outgoing particles in the collision are identical.\nThe effective matrix element of pQCD inspired bremsstrahlung gg \u2194 ggg is taken in a\n3\n\n\fGunion-Bertsch form [17, 18, 19],\n|Mgg\u2192ggg |2 =\n\n9g 4\ns2\n12g 2q2\u22a5\n\u0398(k\u22a5 \u039bg \u2212 cosh y) ,\n2 (q2\u22a5 + m2D )2 k2\u22a5 [(k\u22a5 \u2212 q\u22a5 )2 + m2D ]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g 2 = 4\u03c0\u03b1s . k\u22a5 and y denote the perpendicular component of the radiated gluon momentum and its rapidity in the center-of-mass frame of the collision, respectively. k\u22a5 = |k\u22a5 |,\nand \u039bg is the gluon mean free path, which is calculated self-consistently [9]. The suppression of the bremsstrahlung due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is effectively taken\ninto account within the Bethe-Heitler regime using the step function in Eq. (4). Gluon radiations and absorptions are only allowed if the formation time of the process, typically\n\u03c4 = cosh y/k\u22a5 , is shorter than the mean free path of the radiated or absorbed gluon. Both\nthe Debye screening mass and the gluon mean free path act as an infrared regulator.\nThe total cross section for bremsstrahlung is obtained by the integral\n1 1\n=\n2s 3!\n\n\u03c3gg\u2192ggg\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03931 d\u03932 d\u03933 |Mgg\u2192ggg |2 (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 (4) (p1 + p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 p3 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere d\u0393i \u2261 d3 pi /(2\u03c0)3 /(2Ei ). p1 and p2 denote the four-momenta of the incoming gluons,\n\u2032\n\nand pi , i = 1, 2, 3 denote the four-momenta of the outgoing gluons.

The probabilities are calculated for every doublet and triplet in each spatial\ncell and are compared with random numbers between 0 and 1 to determine whether or not\ninteractions occur. If the random number is smaller than the probability for an interaction,\n4\n\n\fthe interaction occurs and new momenta of outgoing gluons will be sampled according to\nEqs. (1) or (4). Details of the samplings can be found in Ref. [9]. If the random number is\nlarger than the probability for an interaction, no interaction will occur. Particles that do not\nparticipate in interactions within \u2206t will propagate as a free streaming. These operations\nrun over all the cells and time steps until the freezeout condition is reached.\nTo reduce numerical artifacts, the cell length is set to be smaller than the gluon mean free\npath. For instance, in noncentral Au+Au collisions with an impact parameter of b = 8.6 fm,\nthe transverse cell length is set to be a constant small value of \u2206x = \u2206y = 0.125 fm. The\nsetup of the longitudinal cell length is refreshed before each new time step so that there are\nalmost the same number of particles in each \u2206z bin with \u2206z = t[tanh(\u03b7s2 )\u2212tanh(\u03b7s1 )], where\nt is the time in the center-of-mass frame of a Au+Au collision and \u03b7s = 21 ln[(t + z)/(t \u2212 z)]\ndenotes the space time rapidity. It turns out that the longitudinal cells are almost equidistant\nin \u03b7s [10], i.e., |\u03b7s2 \u2212 \u03b7s1 | \u2248 const, which implies a nearly Bjorken-type space time evolution\nof the gluon matter.\nThe accurate solution of the Boltzmann equation using the stochastic method according\nto Eqs. (7)\u2212(9) is guaranteed if there are enough particles in each cell, because this condition is assumed when deriving the interaction probabilities Eqs. (7)\u2212(9) [9]. Because the\ncell volume has to be small, the real gluon number in each cell is too small to fulfill the\ncondition for using the stochastic method. We adopt the test particle method to amplify\nthe particle number with a factor of Ntest . To leave the physical scale of the gluon mean free\n2\npath unchanged, the interaction probabilities are accordingly reduced by Ntest and Ntest\n,\n\nrespectively [see Eqs. (7)\u2212(9)]. One \"event\" means Ntest events with parallel propagations.\nParticles from different events can interact but with the reduced probabilities, so that each\nparticle still behaves as a true physical one. On the other hand, when calculating the real\nparticle number and energy density, the values must be divided by Ntest . We set Ntest = 2400\nfor b = 8.6 fm, which leads to |\u03b7s2 \u2212 \u03b7s1 | \u2248 0.1 for the longitudinal cell length.\nIn the present pQCD simulations the interactions of the gluons are stopped when the local\nenergy density drops below ec . The value for ec is assumed to be the critical value for the\noccurrence of hadronization, below which parton dynamics is not valid. Because a realistic\nhadronization and a hadronic cascade are not yet included in BAMPS, a gluon, which ceases\nto interact, propagates freely and is regarded as a free pion according to the parton-hadron\nduality picture (\u03b4-function fragmentation of the gluon). Thus, ec determines the freezeout\n5\n\n\fcondition. The implementation of a Cooper-Frye prescription for hadronization [24] and the\nsubsequent UrQMD [25] hadronic cascade after the QGP evolution is in progress.\nBecause the implementation of Bose enhancement into transport calculations is still technically difficult, gluons are treated as Boltzmann particles for simplicity. If the gluon system\nis in thermal equilibrium, the energy density is e = 48T 4 /\u03c0 2 . In Ref. [12] we have chosen\nec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 , which leads to a critical temperature of Tc = 200 MeV. To see the possible dependence of the elliptic flow on the freezeout density we choose, in this article, an\nadditional moderately lower value of ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 that gives Tc = 175 MeV.\nThe initial gluon distribution for BAMPS calculations is the same as that chosen in\nRef. [12]: an ensemble of minijets [26] with transverse momenta greater than p0 = 1.4 GeV,\nproduced via semihard nucleon-nucleon collisions. The value of p0 is chosen by matching the\nfinal transverse energy per rapidity from the parton cascade calculations to the experimental\ndata [12]. We use Glauber geometry with a Woods-Saxon profile and assume independent\nbinary nucleon-nucleon collisions. The inclusion of quarks in BAMPS is straightforward and\nis in progress. We do not expect large changes in the integrated elliptic flow v2 , because\nthe quark amount at RHIC is initially about 20% only. As quarks interact weaker than\ngluons, we expect that v2 will be slightly smaller than that obtained in the present pure\ngluon matter approach. More discussion about this issue appears at the end of the next\nsection.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nELLIPTIC FLOW AND DISCUSSIONS ON HADRONIZATION\nResults\n\nThe BAMPS calculations for Au+Au collisions at the RHIC energy\n\n\u221a\nsN N = 200 GeV\n\nare carried out for a set of discrete impact parameters from b = 2 to 11 fm (see Appendix\nA). The corresponding number of participating nucleons Npart (b) is calculated within the\nwounded nucleon model [27]. The details are presented in Appendix A. The results from the\nBAMPS calculations with the given impact parameters are used to obtain the elliptic flow\nas a function of the transverse momentum v2 (pT ) and the transverse momentum spectra in\ndifferent centrality classes. Calculations with randomly sampled impact parameters are not\nappropriate for BAMPS, because a single event is already extremely time consuming for\n\n6\n\n\flarge test particle numbers Ntest .\nFigure 1 shows the elliptic flow v2 = h(p2x \u2212 p2y )/p2T i as a function of the number of\nparticipating nucleons, Npart .

To compare with the\nexperimental data, the gluon number is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nis expected to \"fragment\" to 1.5\u22122 pions on average. The larger the centrality (peripheral\ncollisions), the more fragments are needed, because initial hard gluon jets are less quenched\nin peripheral collisions because of their small reaction size.\nPossible fragmentation of each gluon to more pions suggests v2pion (pT ) \u2248 v2gluon (npT ) and\n\ndN pion (pT ) \u223c dN gluon (npT ) with n = 1.5\u22122. The obtained v2pion (pT ) for low pT < 1 GeV\nwould come closer to the experimental data. Because the integrated v2 is determined mostly\nby the lower pT particles, the integrated v2 of pions will be nearly the same as that of\ngluons. On the other hand, the v2pion (pT ) for pT > 1 GeV would be still 20\u221250% smaller\nthan the data. The discrepancy is larger for more peripheral collisions (see Fig. 3). It\nseems that quark recombination models [31, 32, 33, 34] for hadronization are appropriate\nfor intermediate pT gluons, if one assumes that each gluon must first be converted to a\nquark-antiquark pair g \u2192 q q\u0304 via v2quark (pT /2) \u2248 v2gluon (pT ). Then the quark recombination\nmodels would give v2pion (pT ) \u2248 2v2quark (pT /2)) \u2248 2v2gluon (pT ).\n\nWe also must stress that the results discussed above are obtained from the present calcu-\n\n10\n\n\f1.2\n\n< p\n\nT\n\n> (GeV/c)\n\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n-3\n\ns\n\n0.3\n\n=0.3, e =1 GeV fm\nc\n\n-3\n\ns\n\n0.2\n\nc\n\n-3\n\nSTAR\n\ns\n\n(charged hadrons)\n\n0.1\n\n=0.6, e =1 GeV fm\n\n=0.3, e =0.6 GeV fm\nc\n\n-3\n\ns\n\n=0.6, e =0.6 GeV fm\nc\n\n0.0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n< N\n\npart\n\n700\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n>\n\nSTAR\n-3\n\n600\n\n=0.3, e =1 GeV fm\n\ns\n\nc\n\n(GeV)\n\n300\n\nT\n\n500\n\ndE /d\n\n-3\n\n=0.6, e =1 GeV fm\n\ns\n\nc\n\n-3\n\n=0.3, e =0.6 GeV fm\n\ns\n\nc\n\n-3\n\n400\n\n=0.6, e =0.6 GeV fm\n\ns\n\nc\n\n200\n100\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n< N\n\npart\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n>\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Mean transverse momentum vs Npart (upper panel) and transverse energy\n\u221a\nper pseudorapidity vs Npart (lower panel) in Au+Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV.

The inclusion of quarks will certainly change the\nfreezeout temperature, because the freezeout energy density is proportional to the degeneracy factor of partons, ec \u223c (dG + dQ )Tc4 , where dG = 16 for gluons and dQ = 24 for quarks\nwith two flavors. For the same freezeout energy density the freezeout temperature will be\na factor of 1.26 smaller when the quarks are included and if all the partons are chemically\n\n11\n\n\fequilibrated. Although the initial energy is slightly enlarged when including quarks, we do\nnot expect much stronger transverse flow at freezeout, as long as the shear viscosity of the\nparton system is the same with or without quarks. Therefore, the inclusion of quarks might\nreduce the mean pT by a factor of 1.26, which then would lead to a fair agreement between\nthe calculated and the experimentally measured mean pT via parton-hadron duality. If the\nintegrated v2 is still comparable with the experimental data, then v2 (pT ) will also come to\na closer agreement with the data. Work in this direction is in progress.\nThe parton-hadron duality picture is consistent with the hadronization in a thermalized\nexpanding matter, which assumes that both constituents of the bulk matter at the beginning\nand at the end of the hadronization will be distributed according to thermal statistics. If\nthe temperature does not change much during the phase transition, the integrated v2 , v2 (pT )\nand the pT spectra of pions are almost the same as those of partons. Although the energy\ndensity of pions is smaller than that of partons, the matter will expand continuously during\nthe hadronization, which leaves the total energy, and the total particle number and, thus, the\nentropy of the constituents approximately unchanged. Within the picture of a thermalized\nexpanding source the dependence of v2 (pT ) on the hadron mass was also understood [6] and\nagrees with the RHIC data at lower pT < 1.5 GeV [4, 5].\nOn the other hand, the STAR data [13, 35] confirmed quark recombination models [31,\n32, 33, 34] for hadronization of quarks with intermediate pT \u223c 1\u22122 GeV. These models lead\n\nto v2hadron (pT ) \u2248 nv2quark (pT /n) for n = 2 for mesons and for n = 3 for baryons, which is\nobviously different from the picture of a thermalized expanding source. How the transition\nfrom one to another hadronization scenario proceeds is not clear. Also, how gluons convert\ninto quarks and antiquarks in the recombination models has to be understood and modeled.\nWe emphasize that how the partons hadronize is essential to obtain a complete picture\nof the generation of elliptic flow and to understand the transformation of the v2 (pT ), the pT\nspectra, and the mean pT from the partonic to the hadronic phase in a consistent manner.\nQuantitative calculations modeling hadronization may give a more detailed understanding\nof this subject. As a starting point, an algorithm employing a Cooper-Frye prescription [24]\nwill be implemented in BAMPS in the near future. Detailed comparisons with results from\nrecent calculations using viscous hydrodynamics [36] will be given.\nFinally, the gluons in the present BAMPS calculations are assumed as Boltzmann particles rather than bosons because of numerical difficulties. Bose enhancement increases the\n12\n\n\fgluon density by a factor of \u03b6(3) \u2248 1.202 for a thermal gluon system. Moreover, the enhancement at low pT is considerably larger than that at large pT . This may also have a\nmoderate effect on the pT dependence of the elliptic flow and thus will be investigated in\nmore detail.\n\nIV.\n\nDEPENDENCE OF THE ELLIPTIC FLOW ON THE FREEZEOUT CONDI-\n\nTION\n\nThe elliptic flow v2 will be continuously built up if the spatial anisotropy of the particle\nsystem still exists and sufficiently strong interactions among particles are present. The\nbuildup of v2 does not necessarily mean that v2 becomes always larger. After the time when\nthe eccentricity crosses zero the system will turn spatially anisotropic again but with the\nsign opposite to the eccentricity of the initial one. Further evolution will then decrease v2 .\nWhether or not a generation of negative v2 occurs depends on whether the kinetic freezeout\nof the particle system happens after or before the time when the initial eccentricity crosses\nzero.\nIn this section we discuss the dependence of the elliptic flow on the freezeout condition in\nAu+Au collisions at the RHIC energy. In the present BAMPS calculations the kinetic and\nchemical freezeouts are assumed to occur at the same time when the local energy density\ndrops below the chosen cutoff value of ec . The cutoff ec serves as a critical energy density, at\nwhich gluons are converted to hadrons. After the phase transition no hadronic interactions\ntake place in the present version of BAMPS. We have already speculated that a realistic\nmodeling of hadronization may change the pattern of v2 (pT ) in various ways. Moreover, a\nhadronic cascade simulating the decoupling stage should be included [37, 38, 39]. With the\nhadronic cascade, the kinetic freezeout happens later than the hadronization and the final\nelliptic flow will likely be different from that obtained in the present BAMPS calculations.\nHowever, this difference is expected to be rather marginal, because the viscosity in the\nhadron gas is much larger than that in the QGP.\nAlthough the freezeout is considered in a simple way in the present BAMPS, it is useful\nto study the uncertainty in the calculated v2 , if the value of the critical energy density ec is\nvaried to change the lifetime of the QGP. If the freezeout condition constrains the elliptic\nflow, then it also constrains the to be deduced shear viscosity of the QGP. For this purpose,\n13\n\n\fwe have performed calculations with ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 in addition to those with ec = 1\nGeV fm\u22123 . The results are shown in Figs. 1\u22123 and 5 by green curves with open triangles\n(\u03b1s = 0.3) and purple curves with open diamonds (\u03b1s = 0.6).\nWe realize that the v2 results with \u03b1s = 0.3 and ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 (green curves with\nopen triangles) are almost identical to those with \u03b1s = 0.6 and ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 (red curves\nwith open squares). Stronger interactions or longer QGP phase leads to the same final values\nof v2 . Figure 6 shows the v2 generation as a function of time in a Au+Au collision with\nan impact parameter of b = 8.6 fm. No decrease of v2 is observed.

The saturation of v2 begins\nat 2.5 fm/c for ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 and later at 3 fm/c for ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 . The continuous\nincrease of v2 after 2.5 fm/c in the case for ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 is as strong as that before.\nThe difference of the pressure gradient between the x and y directions is still large at 2.5\nfm/c, whereas at this time the freezeout at ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 is nearly complete. Therefore,\nthe uncertainty in the final elliptic flow due to the different freezeout condition is not small.\nIn addition to the hadronization, the time scale when the hadronization occurs affects also\nthe absolute value of v2 as well as the transverse momentum dependence of v2 .\nA detailed study of the elliptic flow is important, because this collective effect of QCD\nmatter quantitatively constrains the shear viscosity of the medium. In Ref. [12] we have\n\n14\n\n\fdemonstrated within the BAMPS calculations that the shear viscosity to the entropy density\nratio \u03b7/s is nearly constant in time and approximately depends only on the coupling constant\n\u03b1s : \u03b7/s \u2248 0.15 for \u03b1s = 0.3 and \u03b7/s \u2248 0.08 for \u03b1s = 0.6. From Fig. 1 we see that with\n\neither \u03b1s = 0.3 and ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 or \u03b1s = 0.6 and ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 the same values of\nthe final v2 are obtained and which agree very well with the experimental data. Therefore,\naccording to the present study, \u03b7/s is most probably lying between 0.15 and 0.08.\nIf the freezeout occurs at a lower energy density (or temperature), one would expect that\nthe transverse momentum spectra will become softer and the final transverse energy will be\nsmaller. From the lower panel of Fig. 5 we see that dET /d\u03b7 for ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 are only\nslightly smaller than those for ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 . The differences in the transverse momentum\nspectra (not shown) are also tiny. The further decrease of the local energy density from 1\nto 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 due to the longitudinal work done by the pressure is marginal, because\nat the late stage of expansion the system becomes dilute and thus the work done is small.\nFree streaming increases the transverse flow and thus effectively decreases the local energy\ndensity. Therefore, a lower energy density cutoff for the freezeout does not lead to a much\nsmaller total transverse energy and mean transverse momentum, as seen in Fig. 5. On the\nother hand, the v2 (pT ) for \u03b1s = 0.6 and ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 , shown by the purple curve with\nopen diamonds in Fig. 2 and by purple curves in Fig. 3, agree well with the data at the low\npT < 1.5 GeV, whereas the integrated v2 (see the purple curve with open diamonds in Fig.\n1) overestimate the data.\nWe note that within the same description for the gluon interactions the energy loss of\nhigh pT gluons is found to be in good agreement with the results from the GLV formalism\nwhen \u03b1s = 0.3 is used [40]. Hence both jet-quenching phenomena and the buildup of elliptic\nflow are rather well described in BAMPS parton cascade calculations.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nEmploying the pQCD based parton cascade BAMPS that includes pQCD bremsstrahlung\n\u221a\nand its backreaction we have calculated the elliptic flow v2 in Au+Au collisions at sN N =\n200 GeV. Hadronization is assumed to happen at a critical energy density, ec . A gluon\nis then fragmented into a pion according to the parton-hadron duality assumption. The\nhadron v2 is therefore identical to the final gluon v2 within the present BAMPS calculations.\n15\n\n\fWe found that whereas the final gluon v2 from the calculations with \u03b1s = 0.6 and ec =\n1 GeV fm\u22123 agree well with the data, the transverse momentum dependence v2 (pT ) are\n20\u221250% lower then the data in each centrality class. The final gluon transverse momentum\nspectra are harder than the data and also the final gluon mean transverse momenta are\n40\u2212100% larger than the data. However, the final gluon transverse energy per rapidity at\nmidrapidity agrees with the data. This indicates that the hadronization process via the\nparton-hadron duality is not justified. A realistic hadronization that transforms a gluon to\n1.5\u22122 pions on average would be expected for low pT gluons, whereas at intermediate pT ,\nquark recombination would be a better scenario of hadronization. In addition, the inclusion\nof quark degrees of freedom would reduce the final parton mean pT and would lead to a better\nagreement between the calculated and measured v2 (pT ). This must be demonstrated in a\nnew version of BAMPS calculations including the quark dynamics and employing various\nhadronization scenarios.\nThe value of the final gluon v2 depends on the freezeout condition, i.e., ec . The pressure\ngradient difference in the x and y directions at ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 is still large enough to\nfurther increase the elliptic flow if ec is changed to a smaller but still reasonable value. We\nobserved that the final gluon v2 and v2 (pT ) are almost the same in the calculations with\neither \u03b1s = 0.6 and ec = 1 GeV fm\u22123 or \u03b1s = 0.3 and ec = 0.6 GeV fm\u22123 . Stronger\ninteractions or a later freezeout leads to the same elliptic flow. This outlines the uncertainty\nin the extraction of the shear viscosity in the QGP: The shear viscosity to the entropy\ndensity ratio will most probably be between 0.08 and 0.15.\nWe furthermore conclude that adding quark degrees of freedom into the dynamical evolution of the QCD matter with a detailed understanding of the hadronization of gluons and\nquarks will be helpful in explaining the viscous facets of the final hadron elliptic flow and in\nextracting the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio of the QGP. The results presented\nin this article motivate more detailed investigations of this issue in future works.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank M. Bleicher, G. Burau, and H.
