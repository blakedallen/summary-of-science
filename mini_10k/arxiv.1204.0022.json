In particular, it was\nconsidered a two-level uniform accelerated system interacting with a massless\nscalar field. Assuming the two-level system prepared in the ground state and\nthe field in the Minkowski vacuum state, the main result of the paper was to\nshow how the transition rates are modified by event horizon fluctuations. For\n1\n\ne-mail: chgbessa@cbpf.br\ne-mail: jgduenas@cbpf.br\n3\ne-mail: nfuxsvai@cbpf.br\n2\n\n\fmodeling the event horizon fluctuation it was assumed that the scalar field\nsatisfies a massless Klein-Gordon equation with random coefficient. It was\nfound a modified response function with the same local temperature found in\nthe non-fluctuating case. The correction due to the event horizon fluctuations\nhas a Fermi-Dirac factor. A similar result found previously by Takagi [2] in a\nquite different situation. For a careful discussion for the apparent inversion\nof statistics see for example the Ref. [3].\nThe main motivations for such kind of studies follows the ideas present\nin Ref. [4]. In this work it was proposed in condensed matter physics an\nanalog model for quantum gravity effects which in turn is based on results\nobtained by Ford and collaborators [5, 6] and Hu and Shiokawa [7]. Two\ngeneral features of waves propagating in random fluids were considered.\nFirst, acoustic perturbation in a fluid define discontinuity surfaces that\nprovide a causal structure with sound cones. Second, propagation of acoustic\nexcitations in random media are generally described by wave equations\nwith random speed of sound [8, 9, 10, 11]. A quantum scalar field theory\nassociated to acoustic waves was analyzed in a situation where the velocity of\npropagation of the acoustic wave and consequently the sound cone fluctuates.\nIn this approach a stochastic ensemble of fluctuating geometries was assumed.\nIn this paper we follow the ideas present in Ref. [1]. Basically we study\nhow a particular model for the fluctuations of a black-hole event horizon\ncan affect the transition rate of a two-level system [12, 13]. Let us consider\nthe line element of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild space-time describing a\nnon-rotating uncharged black-hole of mass M:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2M\n2M\n2\n2\nds = 1 \u2212\ndt \u2212 1 \u2212\ndr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03a9 2 ,\n(1)\nr\nr\nwhere d\u03a9 2 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere. Close to the horizon r \u2248 2M,\nthe line-element given by Eq. (1) can be written as\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03c1\n2\nds =\ndt2 \u2212 d\u03c12 \u2212 4Md\u03a9 2 ,\n(2)\n4M\np\nwhere \u03c1(r) = 8M(r \u2212 2M) and the quantity 4Md\u03a9 2 describes the line\nelement of a 2-sphere of radius 4M. In turn, the other contribution can\nbe identified with the line element of the two-dimensional Rindler edge by\na\u03be\nsetting t = 4Ma\u03c4 and \u03c1 = ea , for 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e and \u2212\u221e < t < \u221e.\n\n2\n\n\fWe can summarize our approach saying that one model to take into\naccount the effects of black hole event horizons fluctuations is the following:\nwe assume that event horizon fluctuations are modeled basically by a\ncentered, stationary and Gaussian random processes. Under these conditions,\nwe obtain a random differential equation for the Dirac field that cannot be\nsolve exactly. Therefore, we implement a perturbation theory, similar to the\none developed in Ref. [14], in our case associated to a massless Dirac field.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we discuss the\nperturbation theory for the fermionic field in a disordered medium. In section\n3 we present the modified positive Wightman function due to the fluctuating\nhorizon. In section 4 we study the modifications to transition probabilities of\na Unruh-DeWitt detector due the event horizon fluctuations. Finally, section\n5 contains our conclusions. To simplify the calculations we assume the units\nto be such that ~ = c = kB = 1.\n\n2\n\nDirac field in disordered medium\n\nWe begin by writing a random Dirac equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\n0\ni\ni\u03b3 (1 + \u03bc(x)) \u2212 i\u03b3 \u2207i \u2212 m \u03a8(t, x) = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nHere, \u03a8(t, x) represents a fermionic field, \u03b3 0 , \u03b3 i are the Dirac matrices and\n\u03bc(x) is a dimensionless random function of the spatial coordinates. We\nconsider a zero-mean random function, i.e.,\nh\u03bc(x)i\u03bc = 0\n\n(4)\n\nand for simplicity we suppose white-noise correlations, i.e.,\nh\u03bc(x)\u03bc(x\u2032)i\u03bc = \u03c3 2 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(5)\n\nThe symbol h...i\u03bc denote ensemble averaged of noise realizations and \u03c3\nrepresents the strength of the noise. We also suppose that the noise is\nGaussian distributed. These last statements are pragmatic one. This is\none of the simplest models one can choose which can exhibit light cone\nfluctuations. We will also see in next sections that this choice implies in\na loss of stationarity in the Wightman function to the Rindler noise and the\nWiener-Khintchine theorem is no longer valid [15].\n3\n\n\fTo proceed, let us define the Fourier transforms to the Dirac field and\nalso to the noise:\nZ\nd\u03c9 dk \u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212k.x)\n\u03a8(t, x) =\ne\n\u03a8(\u03c9, k),\n(6)\n2\u03c0 (2\u03c0)3\nZ\ndk ik.x\ne \u03bc(\u03c9, k).\n(7)\n\u03bc(x) =\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nSimilar to Ref. [14] we can split Eq. (3) in a free and perturbed\npart (L0 + L1 )\u03a8 = 0, where L0 and L1 are matrices in the coordinates\nor momentum spaces. We have\nL0 = i\u03b3 0\n\n\u2202\n\u2212 i\u03b3 i \u2207i \u2212 m\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202t\nIn the momentum space these operators are written as\nL1 = i\u03b3 0 \u03bc(x)\n\nand\n\n(9)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nL0 = \u03b3 0 \u03c9 + \u03b3 i ki \u2212 m \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 )\n\n(10)\n\nL1 = \u03b3 0 \u03c9\u03bc(k \u2212 k\u2032 ).\n\n(11)\n\nThus, it is possible to define the full (operator valued) fermionic Green\nfunction, S = (L0 + L1 )\u22121 . Assuming a weak noise, a perturbative expansion\nfor S is given by\nS = S0 \u2212 S0 L1 S0 + S0 L1 S0 L1 S0 \u2212 ...\n\n(12)\n\nwhere S0 is just the inverse of the free operator and it is Fourier transformed\nby:\nZ\n1\n\u2032\nS0 (t, x) =\nd4 ke\u2212ik(x\u2212x ) S0 (\u03c9, k).\n(13)\n4\n(2\u03c0)\nIn the massless case, S0 (\u03c9, k) is given by the well known expression:\nS0 (\u03c9, k) = \u2212\n4\n\n\u03b3 0 \u03c9 + \u03b3 i ki\n.\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 k2\n\n(14)\n\n\fAfter performing the average over the fluctuations, which can be seen\nalso as an average in the ensemble of geometries in Eq. (12), we can write\ndown the connected two-point Green function related to the Dirac field as a\nDyson equation\nhSi\u03bc = S0 \u2212 S0 \u03a3hSi\u03bc ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the irreducible self-energy. The first contribution given by\nS\u0304 (1) (t, x) is of second order in random function \u03bc.\nIn the Fourier\nrepresentation it assumes the form given by:\nS\u0304\n\n(1)\n\n(t, x) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 k (1)\n\u2212ik(x\u2212x\u2032 )\nS\u0304\n(\u03c9,\nk)e\n,\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4\n\u03b3 \u03bc k\u03bc 0\n0 \u03b3 k\u03b4\n\u03b3\n\u03a3(\u03c9,\nk)\u03b3\n.\n(17)\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 k2\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 k2\nIn the above equation the self-energy \u03a3(\u03c9, k) is given by\nZ\n(\u03b3 0 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b3 i k \u2032 i )\n.\n(18)\n\u03a3(\u03c9, k) = d3 k\u2032\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 k\u2032 2\nOnly the first part of the integral in Eq. (18) contributes giving 2i\u03c0 2 \u03c9 2 \u03b3 0 .\nA detailed calculation given in appendix A shows that the correction to the\npositive frequency Wightman function is given by\n\nS\u0304 (1) (\u03c9, k) \u2261 \u03c3 2 \u03c9 2\n\nS\u0304 (1) (t, x) =\nwhich\n\n\u0001\n\u03c32 0\n\u03c32\n\u03b3\nI\n+\n\u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 + \u03b3 3 I2\n1\n6\n6\n2D\n2D\n\n(19)\n\nI1 = \u22123684\u2206t6 + 7539\u2206t4 \u2206x2 \u2212 8328\u2206t2 \u2206x4 \u2212 1005\u2206x6\n+i\u01eb(18504\u2206t5 \u2212 24732\u2206t3 \u2206x2 + 9354\u2206t\u2206x4 )\n\n(20)\n\nI2 = \u22121660\u2206t5 \u2206x \u2212 2024\u2206t3 \u2206x3 \u2212 156\u2206t\u2206x5\n+i\u01eb(6620\u2206t4 \u2206x + 5056\u2206t2 \u2206x3 + 12\u2206x5 ).\n\n(21)\n\nand\n\n5\n\n\fWe have used for I1 and I2 an first order expansion: (x + a)n \u2248 xn + nxn\u22121 a\nand D has been defined by D \u2261 (\u2206t \u2212 i\u01eb)2 \u2212 \u2206x2 .\nWe are now able to apply this result to the calculation of the response\nfunction of the Unruh-DeWitt detector. This will be done in next sections.\n\n3\n\nWightman functions and Rindler noise\n\nBefore consider the Unruh-DeWitt detector we need to understand how\nthe Wightman function and the Rindler noise changes if we take into\naccount event horizons fluctuations. First, it is known that for an uniformly\naccelerated reference frame with proper acceleration \u03b1, Rindler's coordinates\nare the appropriate coordinates to be used. The relation to the Minkowskian\ncoordinates is given by\nt = \u03b1\u22121 sinh \u03b1\u03c4\nx = \u03b1\u22121 cosh \u03b1\u03c4\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the observer's proper time. In the observer's proper reference\nframe it is necessary to Fermi-Walker transport the Dirac field due its nonstationarity [2]. We define a proper spinor in the following form\n\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 ) = S\u03c4 \u03a8(x(\u03c4 )),\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the corresponding matrix S\u03c4 takes care of the Fermi-Walker transport.\nHere the observer is, by definition, a Rindler observer, in a given time \u03c4\nrelated to the laboratory frame we define the boosts \u039b\u03c4 , which the nonvanishing components are given by\n(\u039b\u03c4 )00 = (\u039b\u03c4 )11 = cosh \u03b1\u03c4,\n(\u039b\u03c4 )01 = (\u039b\u03c4 )10 = \u2212 sinh \u03b1\u03c4,\n(\u039b\u03c4 )22 = (\u039b\u03c4 )33 = 1.\n\n(24)\n\nSo the corresponding matrix of the transformation of the spinor is given by\n1\n\nS\u03c4 = e 2 \u03b1\u03c4 \u03b30 \u03b31 = cosh(\u03b1\u03c4 /2) + \u03b30 \u03b31 sinh(\u03b1\u03c4 /2).\n6\n\n(25)\n\n\fThe Wightman function will be also Fermi-Walker transported due its\ndefinition in terms of the Dirac Field. The \"proper\" Wightman function in\nthe accelerated reference frame is called the Rindler noise for the Dirac field\nand it is defined by:\nS(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) = S\u03c4 hS + (x(\u03c4 ), x(\u03c4 \u2032 ))i\u03bc S\u2212\u03c4 \u2032 .\n\n(26)\n\nChanging the variables \u03be = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 and \u03b7 = \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2032 the total Green function\nis given by\nS(\u03be, \u03b7) = S (0) (\u03be, \u03b7) + S (1) (\u03be, \u03b7).\n\n(27)\n\nThe Rindler noise associated to the free case (non-random Dirac\nequations) is given by\n\nS\n\n(0)\n\n\u0010 \u03b1\u03b7 \u0011\n\u0010 \u03b1\u03b7 \u0011i S sinh( \u03b1\u03be )\ni \u0010 \u03b1 \u00113 h 0\n\u2212\u03b7\n1\n2\n(\u03be, \u03b7) = 2\n\u03b3 cosh\n+ \u03b3 sinh\n, (28)\n\u03b1\u03be\n4\n2\u03c0 2\n2\n2\nsinh ( 2 \u2212 i\u01eb)\n\nwhich is the result already known in literature. Using Eqs.(19), (20) and (21)\nwe find that the Rindler noise, taking into account fluctuations of the event\nhorizon is given by:\n\nS\n\n(1)\n\n(\u03be, \u03b7) = \u2212\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00116\n\n(\n\n\u03c312 (\u03b7)\u03b3 0 S\u2212\u03b7\n\nsinh( \u03b1\u03be\n)\n2\n\n\u2212 i\u01eb1 )\nsinh7 ( \u03b1\u03be\n2\n)\nsinh( \u03b1\u03be\n)\n2\n1\n2\n+\u03c32 (\u03b7)\u03b3 S\u2212\u03b7\n,\n7 \u03b1\u03be\nsinh ( 2 \u2212 i\u01eb2 )\n2\n\n(29)\n\nwhere some terms were absorbed by the \u01ebi factor. The strength noises\nwere rewritten by \u03c312 (\u03b7) = \u2212\u03c3 2 F (\u03b7) and \u03c322 (\u03b7) = \u2212\u03c3 2 H(\u03b7) which are\npositive functions and grow with \u03b7, while the functions F (\u03b7) and H(\u03b7) are\ngiven by Eqs. (61) and (63) in Appendix B. This result shows how the\nfluctuating event horizon modifies the Rindler noise associated to the Dirac\nfield. In the next section we will apply these results and the results found\nin previous section to find the response function associated to the UnruhDeWitt detector.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nUnruh-DeWitt\nparticles\n\ndetectors\n\nfor\n\nDirac\n\nIn this section we use our results obtained with the Dirac field to study\nthe response and transition probabilities associated with the Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector [16] and [17]. We assume an uniform accelerated detector coupled\nto a massless Dirac field \u03a8 with the following interacting Hamiltonian\nHint = c1 m(\u03c4 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 ).\n\n(30)\n\nIn the Eq. (30) x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) is the world line of the two level system with respect\nto the proper time \u03c4 , m(\u03c4 ) is the monopole moment operator and \u03a8 denotes\na Dirac conjugate to the field \u03a8, and c1 is the coupling constant between the\ndetector and the Dirac field.\nWe consider the detector as a point-like object with a two energy levels\nstructure given by \u03c9g < \u03c9e and eigenstates |gi and |ei respectively [18] and\n[19]. The gap energy between both states would be E = \u03c9e \u2212 \u03c9g . Defining\nthe initial state of the system at \u03c4 = 0 as |\u03c4i i = |gi \u2297 |\u03c8i i and a final state at\ntime \u03c4 by |\u03c4f i = |ei \u2297 |\u03c8f i we can apply perturbation theory to compute the\nprobability of transition of the Unruh-DeWitt detector. Let us assume that\nthe Dirac field is prepared in the Minkowski vacuum state |0, Mi. In first\norder perturbation theory, we get that the probability of transition P (\u03c4, 0)\nis given by\nP (\u03c4, 0) = c21 |he|m(0)|gi|2R(E, \u03c4, 0),\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the detector selectivity is given by c21 |he|m(0)|gi|2. Now we will only\nconcentrate in the response function which is given by\n\nR(E, \u03c4, 0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\nd\u03c4\n0\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 e\u2212iE(\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4\n\n\u2032\u2032 )\n\n(32)\n\n0\n\n\u00d7h0, M|\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )|0, Mi.\nThen, in this case we have to calculate a four-point correlation function. Due\nto the Gaussian nature of the noise this four-point correlation function can\nbe compute in terms of a product of two-point correlation functions. In this\ncase, one can find [19]:\n\n8\n\n\fh0, M|\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )|0, Mi = T r[(S + (\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ))2 ],\n\n(33)\n\nwhere T r is the trace and S + (\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ) = h0, M|\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032 )\u03a8\u0302(\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )|0, Mi is the positive\nfrequency Wightman function. Introducing again the variables \u03be = \u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032\u2032\nand \u03b7 = \u03c4 \u2032 + \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 the response function may be written as [20]\n1\nR(E, \u03c4 ) =\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\nd\u03be\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c4 \u2212|\u03be|\n\nd\u03b7e\u2212iE\u03be T r[(S + (\u03be, \u03b7))2].\n\n(34)\n\n|\u03be|\n\nAfter averaging over the fluctuations, we can introduce Eq. (27) into\nEq. (34) to get the one-loop correction to the response function. Hence,\nwe expand the squared Wightman function in Eq. (33) resulting in four\ncontributions to the response function, where omitting the arguments of the\nWightman functions it can be expressed by:\nT r((S + )2 ) = T r(S02 + S0 S (1) + S (1) S0 + (S (1) )2 ).\n\n(35)\n\nSubstituting the Eq. (35) in Eq. (34) we can write R(E, \u03c4 ) = R0 (E, \u03c4 ) +\nR1 (E, \u03c4 ), where\n1\nR0 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n2\nand\n1\nR1 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nd\u03be\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\nd\u03be\n\u2212\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c4 \u2212|\u03be|\n\nd\u03b7e\u2212iE\u03be T r(S02 ).\n\n(36)\n\nd\u03b7e\u2212iE\u03be T r(S0 S (1) + S (1) S0 ).\n\n(37)\n\n|\u03be|\n\n2\u03c4 \u2212|\u03be|\n\n|\u03be|\n\nIn the asymptotic limit the first term R0 (E, \u03c4 ) gives the known thermal\ncontribution. We show only the result because it can be calculated following\nthe same steps done for the correction which we will show later. The main\naspect is that in the free case (non-random Dirac equation) the probability of\nexcitation, i.e., E > 0 (modulo the selectivity) of the Unruh-DeWitt detector\npresents a Bose-Einstein factor [19]. We get lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e R0 (E, \u03c4 ) = W0 (E, \u03c4 )\nwhere\n1\nE\u03c4\n(4\u03b14 + 5E 2 \u03b12 + E 4 ).\n(38)\n2\u03c0E/\u03b1\n64\u03c0 e\n\u22121\nNote that the second and third terms in Eq. (35) are the main corrections\nup to \u03c3 2 order, see Eqs. (28) and (29), and the last term is of the order \u03c3 4 .\nW0 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n\n9\n\n\fSo, taking the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, the leading contribution due to horizon events\nfluctuations is given by:\nZ\nZ 2\u03c4 \u2212|\u03be|\n8i \u0010 \u03b1 \u00119 \u03c4\n\u2212iE\u03be\nR1 (E, \u03c4 ) = \u2212 2\nd\u03bee\nd\u03b7\n2\u03c0 2\n\u2212\u03c4\n|\u03be|\n\n(\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\u03c312 (\u03b7) + \u03c322 (\u03b7)\n)\nsinh9 ( \u03b1\u03be\n2\n\n)\n\n, (39)\n\nwhere we defined \u03c312 (\u03b7) = \u03c312 (\u03b7) cosh ( \u03b1\u03b7\n) and \u03c322 (\u03b7) = \u03c322 (\u03b7) sinh ( \u03b1\u03b7\n).\n2\n2\nThe integration over \u03b7 it's easier to be done using algebraic computational\nprograms. Let us write these integrations in terms of two functions f1 (\u03c4, \u03be)\nand f2 (\u03c4, \u03be). Now we can obtain the expression:\n)\n(\nZ\n\u22128i \u0010 \u03b1 \u00119 \u03c4\nf\n(\u03c4,\n\u03be)\n+\nf\n(\u03c4,\n\u03be)\n1\n2\nR1 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n.\n(40)\nd\u03bee\u2212iE\u03be\n9 \u03b1\u03be\n2\u03c0 2 2\nsinh ( 2 )\n\u2212\u03c4\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nTo perform these integrals it is convenient to replace \u03c7 = \u03b1\u03be and express\neach integral as\n1\n\u03b1\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\n\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\n\n\u2212i E\n\u03c7\n\u03b1\n\nd\u03c7e\n\nZ\nE\n1 \u221e\nd\u03c7e\u2212i \u03b1 \u03c7 h(\u03c4, \u03c7)\nh(\u03c4, \u03c7) =\n\u03b1 \u2212\u221e\n\u0014Z \u2212\u03b1\u03c4\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212i E\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u2212i E\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nd\u03c7e\n\u2212\nh(\u03c4, \u03c7) +\nh(\u03c4, \u03c7) ,\nd\u03c7e\n\u03b1 \u2212\u221e\n\u03b1\u03c4\n(41)\n\nwhere h(\u03c4, \u03c7) are the terms in the curly brackets from Eq. (40). Replacing\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u2212\u03c7 in the first integral into squared brackets, we can simplify all\nbrackets to a single integral given by:\n16 \u0010 \u03b1 \u00119\nK(E, \u03c4 ) = \u2212\n\u03b1 2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\nd\u03c7 sin\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nE\u03c7\nh(\u03c4, \u03c7).\n\u03b1\n\n(42)\n\nThe nature of this term is associated with the switching on and off of\nthe interaction between the detector and the background field. It can be\nneglected if we assume large proper time intervals. However, for short proper\ntimes intervals it must be taken into account.\nWe need now to evaluate the infinity range integrals in Eq. (41). These\nintegrals are given by:\n10\n\n\fFigure 1: Contours of integration to Eq. (43)\n\n1\nIn (E, \u03c4 ) =\n\u03b1\n\nE\u03c7\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212i \u03b1\nh(\u03c4, \u03c7).\nd\u03c7\nsinhn (\u03c7/2)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(43)\n\nIn these cases n = 9. These integrals can be evaluated choosing the contours\ngiven by Fig. (1) and using the residue theorem done in Refs. [1, 18].\nHowever, note that we have odd order poles. In fact, these integrals will\nbe associated with a nine order residue of h(\u03c7) at \u03c7 = 0. So, performing\nsuch integral the correction to the response function for the Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector is:\n\nW1 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03c3 2 (\u03c4 )E 2\n\u00d7 F (E, \u03b1)\ne2\u03c0E/\u03b1 + 1\n\n(44)\n\nwhere\n\nF (E, \u03b1) =\n\n(\u2212298262\u03b16 \u2212 29302\u03b14E 2 + 12817\u03b12E 4 + 1842E 6 )\n1260\u03c0\u03b1\n\n(45)\n\nand now \u03c3 2 (\u03c4 ) \u2248 \u03c3 2 sinh(\u03b1\u03c4 ) \u2248 \u03c3 2 \u03b1\u03c4 , when \u03b1\u03c4 \u226a 1.\nWe note that the correction to the response function shows a FermiDirac factor instead of a Bose-Einstein factor found in the free case. If\na temperature could be defined here, it would be given by T = 2\u03c0/\u03b1.\nHowever there is some remarks to discussed here. Remember that in the\nMinkowski reference frame the noise function \u03bc(x) depends only on the\nspatial coordinates, while in the Rindler system the noise function depends\n11\n\n\fon the proper time \u03c4 , in other words the noise is a function of \u03be and \u03b7,\nand now we have a non-equilibrium behavior of the field measured by the\ndetector. In this case we can define a local temperature, see Refs. [21] and\n[22], which depends on the proper time by the function \u03bc(\u03be, \u03b7). It was showed\nthat the temperature which appears in the response function correction is an\naveraged temperature over the fluctuations and the global temperature is\nrelated with the thermal equilibrium.\nThe last result shows that the lack of stationarity in the accelerated\nframe does not necessarily implies that a thermal-like response function with\nlocal temperature is forbidden. With such above considerations a possible\ninterpretation of our result is that light-cone fluctuations in this model lead\nto the emergence of a local temperature as seen by accelerated observers.\nSo far we have evaluated the horizon fluctuating contribution to the\nresponse function for an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless\nfermionic field. Instead using a detector like that one considered in Eq.\n(30), it is also possible to use another kind of detectors. It is known that\nthe interaction Hamiltonian for the scalar field coupled with the UnruhDeWitt detector is a monopole-moment [12]. In other words, it is a two level\nsystem operator coupled with a scalar field, hence it is linear in the field.\nIt gives a response function which depends on the two point instead of the\nfour point Green function found to the fermionic field case. Thus, instead of\nHamiltonian given by Eq. (30), we can find an analogue kind of monopolemoment detector similar to the scalar case Hamiltonian. Despite the fact\nthat this detector is less realistic, one can consider it equipped with a spinor\n\u0398 and coupled linearly to the field via the Hamiltonian:\nHint = \u0398(\u03c4 )\u03a8(x(\u03c4 )) + \u03a8(x(\u03c4 ))\u0398(\u03c4 ),\n\n(46)\n\nwhere x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) is again the world line of the two level system with respect to\nthe proper time \u03c4 , and \u0398(\u03c4 ) is the fermionic monopole moment operator.\nTo keep the Hamiltonian stationary to the observer's proper reference frame\nit is also necessary to Fermi-Walker transport the monopole operator and\nthe Dirac field, in same way that was done above using Eqs. (23)-(25). One\ncan also formulate a perturbation theory in the interaction picture where it\n \u0304\nis assumed that \u0398\u0302 = S\u03c4 \u0398 and \u0398\u0302 = \u0398\u0304S\u03c4 rather than \u0398 and \u0398\u0304 obey the\ntime-evolution equations.\nFollowing these steps one can find the new response function:\n\n12\n\n\f\u0014 Z \u03c4\nZ \u03c4\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n0\n\u2032\nF (E, \u03c4, 0) = T r \u03b3\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 e\u2212iE(\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 )\n4\n0\n0\ni\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7h0|\u03a8\u0302\u03b1 (x(\u03c4 ))\u03a8\u0302\u03b2 (x(\u03c4 ))|0i .\n\n(47)\n\nThis result is similar to that one found in Ref. [23].\nThe response function is proportional to the two point Wightman function\ninstead of the four point function found previously. The calculation is done\nin a finite time interval as was done in Eqs. (41, 42), and up to first order in\n\u03c4 we have that the correction due to horizon fluctuations is\nW1 (E, \u03c4 ) \u2248\n\n\u03c3 2 (\u03c4 ) (\u22128059\u03b14 E \u2212 55\u03b12 E 3 + 3684E 5 )\n60\u03c0\u03b1(e2\u03c0E/\u03b1 \u2212 1)\n\n(48)\n\nthe \u03c3 2 (\u03c4 ) is the same as in Eq. (44). This integral was evaluated using Eq.\n(43) with n = 6 and we also considered the same contour given in Fig. (1).\nIn the case without fluctuations the two point function is given by Eq.\n(28), and the response is\nW0 (E, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03c0\u03c4 [E 2 + (\u03b1/2)2 ]\n\n,\n(49)\n2\u03c0E\ne \u03b1 +1\nComparing Eqs. (48) and (49) we note that the event horizon fluctuation\nmodifies the Fermi-Dirac response found in the free case. It appears a\nBose-Einstein factor. As we discussed, it is also possible to define a local\ntemperature, T = 2\u03c0/\u03b1, in this non-equilibrium situation and, in a similar\nway, the effective noise strength is proportional to the proper time.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nRecently it was proposed in condensed matter physics an analog model for\nquantum gravity effects [4] and in Ref. [14] the authors extended this theory\nto a real massive scalar field. In Ref. [1] it was considered a massless scalar\nfield near a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole with event horizon\nfluctuations. They used a perturbation theory similar to that one previously\nconsidered in fluctuating disordered media.\nIn this paper we have used these ideas to study the behavior of a massless\nfermionic field near a fluctuating black hole horizon using the techniques\n13\n\n\fdescribed before. First, we developed a perturbation theory associated to a\nmassless fermionic field in the presence of random noise. After performing the\ncalculations we have applied these results to investigate the thermal radiation\nnear a fluctuating horizon. We showed that horizon fluctuation implies that\nthe Unruh-DeWitt detector which has a Bose-Einstein factor in the response\nfunction associated with the free case has now a correction which has FermiDirac factor. We would like to stress that we are assuming that it is possible\nto define a local temperature in this non-equilibrium situation. In a less\nrealistic detector, coupled linearly with a Dirac field, the correction has also\nan apparent change in the distribution measured by in the response function\nwith unchanged temperature. In this situation the leading term (case without\nfluctuations) has a Fermi-Dirac factor and in the correction appears a BoseEinstein factor.\nSince the de Sitter horizon has also a thermal spectrum measured by\nthe Unruh-DeWitt detector [24] for both, bosons and fermions, a natural\nextension of our work is to study the effects of a fluctuating de Sitter horizon\nto such kind of coupling. It is also natural to enquire the effects of introducing\na time dependent randomness [25] in place of the Eqs. (4) and (5). Such\nrandom coefficients allows the possibility of particle production from the\nbeginning [7]. These subjects are under investigation by the authors.\n\nAppendix A\n\nOne-loop correction to positive\nfrequency Wightman function\n\nLet us begin from Eq. (17) which gives the correction to the positive\nfrequency Wightman function. The self energy is given in Eq.
