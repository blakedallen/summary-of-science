This is particularly severe for a long beamline such as the undulator\nbeamlines. This problem can be overcome by introducing a local bump at the particular beamline. However, for\nsome light sources, there are not enough corrector magnets\nto generate local bumps as much as needed. This difficulty\ncan be overcome when we correct the COD under the condition where the beam positions at particular points are not\nchanged. This is our main objective to develop a method of\nthe closed orbit correction under constraint conditions.\n\n2 THEORY\n2.1\n\nOrdinary COD correction and regularization\n\nThe beam position is normally described as a vector |xi\nmeasured by M beam position monitors (BPM). In order to\ncorrect the COD, we need N corrector magnets with their\nstrengths described as a vector |ki. When the corrector\nmagnets kick a beam, the new beam positions |yi can be\n\u2217 kimkh@postech.ac.kr,\n\u2020 isko@postech.ac.kr\n\nhttp://fal.postech.ac.kr\n\n|yi = R |ki + |xi .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, R is called the response matrix of (M \u00d7 N ) dimensions whose components are given by\np\n\u03b2i \u03b2j\nRij =\ncos (|\u03a8i \u2212 \u03a8j | \u2212 \u03c0\u03bd) ,\n(2)\n2 sin \u03c0\u03bd\nwhere \u03bd is the betatron tune of the storage ring, and (\u03b2i , \u03a8i )\nand (\u03b2j , \u03a8j ) are the beta function and the phase function\nfor the ith BPM and j th corrector magnet, respectively. In\norder to reduce the COD, we have to choose the kick of\neach corrector magnet satisfying\nRT R |ki + RT |xi = 0 .\n\n(3)\n\nIt is called the PSINOM algorithm[1].\nThe COD correction is actually a minimization procedure of S defined as\n1\b\nhk| RT R |ki + 2 hx| R |ki + hx |xi .\n(4)\nS=\n2\nBy using the relations of vector operators which are hyperdimensional gradient operators, we can get the same result\nof PSINOM algorithm as shown in eq. (3).\nThis algorithm includes an inversion procedure of the\nmatrix RT R. In some cases, we can get unacceptable corrections due to the ill-posedness of RT R. A regularization\nmethod is introduced to avoid this problem. In this case, S\nis written as\n1\b\nS=\nhk| RT R |ki + 2 hx| R |ki + hx |xi\n2\n1\n(5)\n+ hk| \u03b1 |ki .\n2\nwhere \u03b1 is the regularization parameter. Then the minimum corrector kicks can be determined by\n\u0001\nRT R + \u03b1I |ki + RT |xi = 0 .\n(6)\nThis equation represents the modified PSINOM algorithm,\nand we can relax the inversion problem of the singular\nmatrix by using the diagonal matrix \u03b1I when RT R is\nsingular[2].\n\n\f2.2\n\nMethod with constraint conditions\n\n3\n\nAfter having the new closed orbit with the minimum distortion from eq. (6), the new orbit is generally different from\nthe original orbit. Sometimes, this difference can be taken\nplace at very sensitive locations such as the entrance and\nthe exit of an undulator. If the beamline is well aligned for\nthis undulator, a COD correction should be avoided in this\nregion. A constraint condition can be described in terms of\nthe beam position at ith BPM such as\nhRi |ki + x0i = xi .\n\n(7)\n\nHere, hRi | is the ith row of the response matrix R. Also,\nx0i and xi are the beam positions before and after the correction, respectively. Since we want to keep this position\nunchanged, hRi |ki should be zero. If there are L BPMs\ninvolved in the constraint condition, we can write the constraint condition as follows.\nCT |ki = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nHere, CT is the (L \u00d7 N ) sub-matrix of the response matrix.\nEach component of CT corresponds to the BPM involved\nin the constraint condition. We also assume that |ki has a\nnon-trivial solution.\nWe now add this constraint condition to the modified\nPSINOM algorithm to obtain the new S such as,\nS=\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nhk| RT R |ki + 2 hx| R |ki + hx|xi\n2\n1\n+ hk| \u03b1 |ki + h\u0393| CT |ki .\n2\n\n(9)\n\nHere, h\u0393| is the Lagrangian multiplier, and it is an L dimensional vector. By following the derivative to the corrector\nstrength, we can get the vector |ki which minimizes the\nclosed orbit distortion outside the constraint region such\nas,\n(A + \u03b1I) |ki + RT |xi + C |\u0393i = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nHere, we define the square matrices of N \u00d7 N dimensional\nA and L \u00d7 L dimensional D as follows.\nA = RT R,\nT\n\nD = C (A + \u03b1I)\n\n\u22121\n\n(11)\n\nC.\n\n(12)\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF SIMULATOR\nUSING EPICS\n\nThe algorithm developed in the previous section has been\nsuccessfully tested for the Pohang Light Source (PLS) operation. The new correction code is written in C language\nand it is installed in one of the operator consoles which\nis a SUN workstation. Although the PLS control system\nis not using Experimental Physics and Industrial Control\nSystem (EPICS) which is used in many accelerator laboratories world-widely, there is a plan to upgrade the control system based on EPICS technology[3, 4]. As a part of\nsuch upgrade activity, we have started the development orbit correction algorithm with EPICS. Since we do not have\nany EPICS-based control system yet, we decide to develop\nthe orbit correction simulator using EPICS.\nIn order to seek the way to adopt our orbit correction algorithm into EPICS, we have considered two ways: one is\nbased on the subroutine record and the other is using the\nstate notation language (SNL) program. The first method\nneeds new record support that runs the orbit correction algorithm. To do this, the correction code is required to be\nwritten upon the protocol required by the record support\nsuch as the entry structure and the callback structure. This\napproach gives relatively fast response because this method\nuses database access and can access the record by process\npassive mode[4, 6]. This is a good feature for the realtime\nsystem but the large portion of the orbit correction code\nwe have already tested must be rewritten according to the\nprotocol of the record support.\nOne of important tasks of EPICS input/output controller\n(IOC) is the sequencer that runs programs written in SNL.\nThe SNL considers the control object as the state machine\nand treats transitions between states. The sequencer monitors the transitions for the SNL and runs callback functions using the entry table the corresponding program written in SNL. Since the sequencer accesses to the record via\nchannel access (CA) and the record access is only possible\nthrough non-process passive mode, there are some restrictions in access time or the treatment of records. However,\nthis method can directly imbed the program written in C\nlanguage. Also, unlike the subroutine record, this method\ncan remove program tasks without rebooting the system,\nwhich gives the code debugging very easy[4, 5]. Thus, the\nsecond method gives more benefits when the system does\nnot require heavy realtime demands. Upon reviewing the\ntwo methods, we have decided to use the latter method.\n\nEq. (10) can be rewritten as\n|\u0393i = \u2212D\u22121 CT (A + \u03b1I)\u22121 |xi .\n\n(13)\n\nNow, we can remove the Lagrangian multiplier |\u0393i in eq.\n(10) by using the above equation. Then, we can finally get\nthe kick values of the corrector magnets as follows.\no\nn\n\u22121\n\u22121\nI \u2212 CD\u22121 CT (A + \u03b1I)\n|ki = \u2212 (A + \u03b1I)\nRT |xi . (14)\n\n3.1\n\nSNL program\n\nThe orbit correction simulator is developed in IOC level\nand has the SNL program imbedding C codes and several\ndatabase records, as shown in Fig. 1. There are two parts\nin the SNL program: one for the feedback including the\norbit correction algorithm and the other for the simulator\nwhich emulates the PLS storage ring. The latter calculates\norbit changes from ai:KICK$(kick no) records which store\nthe corrector strengths obtained from the response matrix\n\n\fState Notation Program\n\nai:OrgOrbit$(bpm_no)\nx108\n\ncalc:Orbit$(bpm_no)\nx108\n\nFLNK\n\nSLNK\n\nINP\n\nVAL\n\nSimulator\n\nNPP NMS\n\nVAL\n\nfor PLS Storage Ring\n\nINPA\nINPB\n\nai\n\ncalc\n\nSCAN:Passive\n\nSCAN:Passive\nVAL=A+B\n\nai:KICK$(kick_no)\nx70\n\nai:CorrOrbit$(bpm_no)\nFLNK x108\n\nINP\nVAL\n\nInput/Output\nController (IOC)\n\nINP\nVAL\n\nai\n\nNPP NMS\n\nai\n\nSCAN:Passive\n\nai\n\nFeedback Algorithm\n1 <= bpm_no <= 108\n1 <= kick_no <= 70\n\nINP\nVAL\n\nai:numBPM\nai\n\n00\n11\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nINP\n\nbi\n\nbi\n\nINP\n\nINP\nVAL\n\nINP\nVAL\n\nbi:KickSetFLAG\nbi\n\nbi:GenOrbitFLAG\nbi\nINP\n\nINP\n\nVAL\n\nbi:FeedbackFLAG\n\nVAL\n\nbi\n\nVAL\n\nVAL\n\nbi:DebugFLAG\nbi\nINP\n\nVAL\n\nbi:GenParamFLAG bi:GenRandomOrbitFLAG\n\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n000000\n0000000000000000111111\n1111111111111111\n\nai:numCorrector\nai\nINP\n\nVAL\n\nai:startCONSTR\nai\n\nOperator Interface (OPI)\n\nINP\n\nVAL\n\nai:endCONSTR\n\nFigure 1: Schemematic diagram of the orbit correction simulator\nmeasured at the PLS. This process is actually a product of\nmatrix and column vectors. The calculated orbit changes\nare stored at ai:CorrOrbit$(bpm no) records. In the next\nstep, the corrector strengths s calculated by the algorithm\ndescribed in the previous section and the results are stored\nat al:KICK$(kick no).\n\n3.2\n\nDatabase and record linkage\n\nThe SNL program we have developed consists of four state\nsets. Since they are linked together and interacted dynamically via EPICS database, we need to understand the\ndatabase and its records as well as the linkage between\nthem. The ai:KICK$(kick no) record uses the analog input record to represent the corrector strength. There are\n70 records altogether as representing 70 correctors in the\nPLS storage ring. They are linking the simulator and the\nfeedback in a parallel manner. The index $(kick no) is the\ninteger value between one and 70.\nThe\nrecords\nof\nai:OrgOrbit$(bpm no)\nand\nai:CorrOrbit$(bpm no) are the orbit distortion before\nthe feedback is applied and the orbit change after the\nfeedback, respectively. They are using analog input\nrecords. Since these records represents the changes at\nthe PLS BPM, $(bpm no) is the interger value between\none and 108. The superposition of these two records\ngives new orbit. This can be done by the calculation\nrecord calc:Orbit$(bpm no).\nSince this calculation\nrecord is linked forwardly from ai:OrgOrbit$(bpm no)\nand ai:CorrOrbit$(bpm no), the superposition is newly\ncalculated whenever the values of two records are changed.\nOn the other hand, ai:numBPM, ai:numCorrector,\nai:startCONSTR, and ai:endCONSTR are representing the\nBPMs and correctors used in the correction algorithm, start\nand end point of the constraint region, respectively. They\nare using analog input records and notifying the SNL program if necessary.\nThe other records are binary input records and they are\n\nrepresenting necessary status flags. They are used as the\nmediator of state transitions between state sets in the SNL\nprogram.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have developed the COD correction algorithm under\nthe constraint condition where the beam position at particular point is not changed. The new algorithm is based on\nthe modified PSINOM algorithm which includes the regularization process in order to avoid the inversion problem\nof the ill-posed response matrices.\nWe have confirmed that this algorithm is working well\nand is in good agreement with the experimental results [7].\nEven though the PLS is planning to upgrade their control\nsystem with EPICS, there is no working EPICS based control system at PLS. Due to this, we have developed the orbit\ncorrection simulator using C-code embedded SNL program\nbased on EPICS technology. This simulator part can be replaced by the real control system with minor changes after\nthe completion of the upgrade.\n\n5\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] W.
