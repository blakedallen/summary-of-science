Spain.\n(Dated: October 28, 2018)\nWe studied the growth of an epitaxial graphene monolayer on Ru(0001). The graphene monolayer\ncovers uniformly the Ru substrate over lateral distances larger than several microns reproducing the\nstructural defects of the Ru substrate. The graphene is rippled with a periodicity dictated by the\ndifference in lattice parameter between C and Ru. The theoretical model predict inhomogeneities\nin the electronic structure. This is confirmed by measurements in real space by means of scanning\ntunnelling spectroscopy. We observe electron pockets at the higher parts of the ripples.\nPACS numbers: 73.20.-r, 68.37.Ef, 68.55.-a, 81.05.Uw\n\nThe possibility to produce single layers of graphene\n[1, 2] has opened a fascinating new world of physical\nphenomena in two dimensions. Graphene has already\nshown that its charge carriers are massless Dirac fermions\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and that it displays an anomalous integer\nQuantum Hall Effect [3, 4, 5] even at room temperature\n[8]. Systems made up of a few graphene layers can also\nbe grown on a SiC substrate [9, 10]. Recently it has\nbeen shown that free standing isolated graphene layer is\nintrinsically corrugated [11]. These modulations in the\nheights of the graphene layers may be related to the\ncharge inhmogeneities observed in nominally undoped\nsamples[12] (see[13]).\nUltra-thin epitaxial films of graphite have been grown\non solid surfaces for quite some time [14]. Even the\ngrowth of \"monolayer-graphite\" films onto several substrates by Chemical Vapor Deposition have been reported\nsome time ago, but the degree of characterization of the\nfilms was hampered by the existing experimental limitations [15].\nIn this letter we report on a method to fabricate highly\nperfect, on the scale of microns, periodically rippled\ngraphene monolayer and islands on Ru(0001) under Ultra\nHigh Vacuum (UHV) conditions. We characterized by\nmeans of scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy\n(STM/STS) the perfection at atomic scale and the local\nelectronic structure of the periodically rippled graphene\nmonolayer. The periodicity of the ripples is dictated by\nthe difference in lattice parameters of graphene and substrate, and, thus, it is adjustable. We observe inhomogeneities in the charge distribution, i.e electron pockets\nat the higher parts of the ripples. This inhomogeneity in\nthe electronic structure can be understood with the help\nof a tight-binding model. The potential associated with\nthe rippled structure induce a charge transfer from conduction to valence bands for some atoms and the opposite\nin the others. Finally we studied graphene nanoislands\nthat display hexagonal shape with atomically resolved\nzigzag edges, whose characteristic edge states allows us\n\nto determine the doping of the graphene layer.\nThe experiments have been carried out in a UHV\nchamber with base pressure of 4\u00d710\u221211 Torr that contains a variable temperature STM and a rear view\nLow Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) optics. The\nRu(0001) crystal was cleaned by cycles of Ar+ sputtering\nand annealing followed to oxygen exposure and heating\nto high temperature [16]. The graphene layers were produced either by controlled segregation of C from the bulk\nof the substrate or by thermal decomposition at 1000 K\nof ethylene molecules pre-adsorbed at 300 K on the sample surface. The W tips were routinely cleaned by ion\nbombardment and annealing. The dI/dV curves were\nobtained by numerical differentiation of the I(V ) curves.\nWe model the graphene electronic bands by a nearest\nneighbor tight-binding model with parameter t=3eV, a\nperiodic shift of the carbon pz levels, and a finite broadening due to the hybridization with the metallic substrate. In order to calculate the density of states, we\nuse a (30\u00d730) unit cell, and a sum over 6 special points\nin the irreducible sector of the Brillouin zone. Hence,\nthe total number of states included in the calculation is\n10800. This is sufficient to resolve local changes in the\nelectron density in the order of 10\u22122 -10\u22123 carriers per\ncarbon atom.\nThe epitaxial layer of graphene covers completely the\nsurface of the single-crystal Ru substrate over distances\nlarger than a micron (see [17]) and presents a triangular\nperiodicity of 2.4 nm (Fig. 1(a)) that is due to the coincidence lattice of graphene and Ru, i.e. the lattice of\ngraphene is incommensurate with the underlying lattice\nof Ru, with a size relation that implies that 10 carbon\nhoneycombs (0.246 nm) will adjust almost exactly with\n9 Ru-Ru interatomic distances (0.27 nm). The weakly\ninteracting (see below), laterally undistorted graphene\nstructure rides on top of the lattice of the substrate, resulting in some C atoms being somewhat higher than\nothers. The graphene layer, thus, is rippled in a periodic fashion, with a periodicity dictated by the difference\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n0.08\n\nHe igh t (nm)\n\nin lattice parameters. Variations of this approach using\nother experimental conditions can be used to produce\ngraphene monolayers on other single-crystal substrates\n[18].\nWith the STM images we characterize the type of defects that appear in the epitaxial graphene layer. The\nmonoatomic steps and dislocations of the substrate are\nreproduced, but there are also upper part of the ripples\nthat are weaker or even missing completely in the STM\nimages, as can be seen in Fig. 1 (a) and in ref. [25]. Fig.\n1 (b) shows a high resolution topographic STM image of\nthe epitaxial graphene layer, revealing its atomic structure. Unlike STM images of graphite [19], which show\nnormally only one of the two C atoms in the surface unit\ncell, the honeycomb structure of graphene is clearly resolved in the upper part of the ripples with its 0.14 nm\nC-C distance. The Fourier transform of larger atomically resolved STM images shown as inset in Fig. 1(b)\nindicates that the ripples constitute a (10\u00d710) superlattice with respect to the C lattice. The (9\u00d79) coincidence\nlattice with the Ru(0001) substrate is revealed in the corresponding LEED pattern (not shown).\nThe apparent vertical corrugation of the rippled\ngraphene monolayer, as seen with STM, changes with\nthe tunnelling voltage, ranging from 0.1 nm (at a sample\nvoltage of -1 V) to 0.02 nm (at +1 V). This indicates\nthe importance of electronic effects. The C-C apparent\natomic corrugation inside the honeycomb unit cell is only\nof the order of 0.005 nm (Fig 1(d)). The actual geometric corrugation of the rippled layer can be estimated to\nbe below 0.02 nm from the observed lack of diffracted\npeaks for a beam of thermal He atoms scattering off the\ngraphene surface [20].\nThe bonding with the substrate occurs through the\nhybridization of the C \u03c0-states with the Ru d states.\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy shows clearly that the layer\nbonding is not carbidic. Angular Resolved Photo Electron Spectroscopy data show that the graphene bands in\ngraphene/Ru(0001) are similar to the ones of graphite,\nbut rigidly shifted down in energy [21]. The bottom of\nthe \u03c0 band at the center of the Brillouin Zone is shifted\ndown by 1.8 eV with respect to graphite [21]. The small\nenergy shift of the C1s core level with respect to graphite\nindicates that the charge transfer from the substrate is\nsmall, but not negligible, i.e. the graphene layer is doped\nwith electrons by the substrate.\nThe graphene-Ru interface is atomically well defined.\nThe average interlayer distance for the closely related\nincommensurate graphene/Pt(111) system has been determined to be rather large (0.37 nm) by means of tensor LEED analysis [15]. First principles calculations in\nthe similar graphene/Ir(111) system have indicated that\nthe average binding (0.2 eV/C atom) is barely strong\nenough to correspond to chemical bond formation [22].\nThe incommensurate nature of the graphene monolayer is\nan additional indication that the interaction of graphene\n\n(d)\n\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nDistance(nm)\n\nCarbon atoms\nRuthenium atoms\n\nFIG. 1: (Color on line) : (a) 76 nm \u00d776 nm STM image of\ngraphene/Ru(0001) showing the decoration of a screw dislocation and a monoatomic step from the substrate.

The spectra correspond\nto the high (black curve) and low (red curve) regions of the\nrippled graphene layer.\n\nthe same energies in both regions of the ripples.\nThe electronic structure has been simulated by taking\ninto account that the rippled graphene layer is not too\ndistorted. The model calculations have been performed\nfor an isolated graphene layer in which the effect of the\nsubstrate has been considered to result in: i) a shift of the\nDirac point by -0.3 eV due to doping; ii) the introduction\nof a finite lifetime caused by hybrization of the \u03c0 orbitals\nwith the band of the substrate; and iii) a (10\u00d710) periodic potential that changes between -3V and 3V/2,where\nV=-0.3eV to account for the periodic structural ripples.\nThis value for the potential gives the better agreement\nwith the experiments. For higher values of the potential\nthe asymmetry in the calculated DOS is bigger than the\none found in the experiments. The \u03c0 band in graphene\nhas a total width of W\u223c6t, where t\u223c3 eV is the hopping\nbetween \u03c0 orbitals at nearest neighbor C atoms [23].\nIn agreement with the experiments, the calculations\nshow that the occupied LDOS is larger on the \"high\"\n\nregions of the superlattice, where the potential is at a\nminimum, while the empty LDOS is larger at the \"low\"\nregions of the graphene layer(see lower panel in Fig. 3).\nThis effect is extremely robust and indicates that the valence band is depleted in the low portions of the ripples,\nwhile the conduction band is depleted at the high parts\nof the ondulated graphene layer. The calculations also\nreproduce the weaker features at both sides of the Fermi\nenergy that reflect the existence of the periodic superlattice, which induces a folding of the graphene bands\nin the new (10\u00d710) Brillouin Zone. The reconstruction\nconsider here does not superimpose the two inequivalent\ncorners of the Brillouin zone and it does not open a gap at\nthe Dirac energy [24]. The spectrum is split on subbands\nseparated by gaps, away from the K and K' points.\nThe periodic charge inhomogeneities in the graphene\nlayer can be visualized directly in the real space by imaging the spatial distribution of dI/dV close to the Fermi\nenergy. Fig. 3 shows the spatial distribution of the\nLDOS below and above the common Fermi level (which\ncorresponds to the shifted neutrality level of the doped\ngraphene layer). The experimental images are in the upper row at the left and the right of the corresponding topographic image. The bright regions correspond to larger\nLDOS. For a complete set of spatially resolved dI/dV\nmaps versus sample bias voltage see ref. [25].\nThese inhomogeneities in the charge distribution produced by the periodic ripples are probably also present\nin the structural corrugations inherent to free standing,\nisolated graphene monolayers [11].\nThe growth method described here can also be used\nto produce different graphene nanostructures, such as\nnanowires on vicinal surfaces or nanometer wide islands\nas illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The apparent step height of\nthe island is 0.15 nm (from the Ru surface to the lower\npart of the ripples) showing that the graphene layer is\nindeed only one monolayer high. The inset shows that\nthe islands are truncated hexagons with straight edges\nof a single structural type. It is remarkable that the\nperiodically rippled coincidence lattice goes right to the\nsteps of the islands. In fact in some cases the island step\ncuts the (10\u00d710) arrangement. This confirms that the\noverlayer of graphene is indeed weakly coupled to the Ru\nsubstrate. Further zooming into the island reveals that\nthe geometry of the steps is of the zigzag type.\nThe relative orientation of the graphene layer with respect to the underlying Ru lattice can be determined by\nresolving simultaneously both atomic lattices. In order\nto facilitate the resolution of the weakly corrugated Ru\nlattice, CO has been adsorbed at saturation in the parts\nof the Ru surface not\u221acovered\n\u221a by graphene. The geometry of the resulting ( 3 \u00d7 3 R30\u25e6 ) structure of CO on\nRu(0001) is well known [26], and, thus, the relative orientation of graphene and Ru lattices represented in Fig.\n1 has been obtained.\nFig. 4(b) shows local tunnelling spectra recorded when\n\n\f4\n\n0.7\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nHigh\nLow\nRu(0001)\n\ndI/dV (nA/V)\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nHigh LDOS\n0. 00 \u00c5\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nSample voltage (V)\n\nLow LDOS\n2. 28 \u00c5\n\nFIG. 3: (Color on line) The left and right images in the upper panel are maps of dI/dV at -100 meV and + 200 meV\nand reflects the spatial distribution of the LDOS below and\nabove the Fermi level, respectively, for an extended graphene\nlayer on Ru(0001).

The image was\nrecorded at Vs =-4.5 meV and It =3 nA. The inset shows an\nimage of the whole island with a lateral size of 47 nm. The\nimages are differentiated in X direction. (b) Spatially resolved\ntunnelling spectra measured on the high (black curve) and\nlow (red curve) areas of the ripples close to the edge of the\nisland and on clean Ruthenium (blue curve). The Ruthenium\nspectra was offset for clarity\n\nthe surface is only partially covered with graphene. The\nadvantage of this situation is that one can take spectra in\nthe clean Ru patches of the surface, where only the surface state of Ru should be detected, and, thus, spurious\nfeatures from the tip DOS can easily be detected. The\nspectra recorded at the center of the islands are undistinguishable from the one obtained on extended graphene\nlayers (see Fig. 2). The spectra taken at the edges, however, show a new peak at -0.4 eV, particularly on the\n\"high\" areas of the ripples, which might be related to the\ntheoretically predicted edge states [27]. The spectrum\nrecorded on the clean Ru patches show only the surface\nstate around the Fermi energy observed on Ru(0001) [16].\n\ndistribution in the graphene. This have been measured\nwith spatially resolved dI/dV maps and confirmed with\na theoretical model. The new periodicity also induce the\nopening of a series of minigaps by the additional periodic\npotential. The presence of these minigaps is expected to\ngive rise to new phenomena at low temperatures in the\npresence of high magnetic fields. We atomically resolve\nthe zig-zag edges of graphene islands and we use the position in energy of the edge state to determine the doping\nof the graphene layer. The methods described here can\nbe implemented on many other single crystal substrates,\ngiving rise to a series of graphene monolayers with different, substrate-dependent, periodic corrugations and,\nthus, opening the possibility to systematically test the\nelectronic properties of controlled, charge inhomogeneous\ngraphene layers. Methods to transfer the present finding\nto experimental systems adequate for lateral transport\nmeasurements are in progress.\n\nIn summary we have grown graphene monolayers and\nislands on Ru(0001). The graphene monolayer presents\na periodically rippled surface due to the difference in lattice parameter between graphene and the metallic substrate. The periodic ripples produce a spatial charge re-\n\n\f5\nPartial financial support by the Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia through projects MAT2003-08627-C0202, NAN2004-08881-C02-01, FIS2005-05478-C02-01, the\nComunidad de Madrid, through the programs CITECNOMIK, CM2006-S-0505-ESP-0337 and NANOMAGNET, S-0505/MAT/0194 and the European Union Contract 12881 (NEST), is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n[1] K.S.
