I would also like to thank Srinivas\nSridhar for allowing the use the experimental images shown in Fig.1.\nA knowledgments.\n\n2.\n\nSemi lassi al Pseudodifferential Operators on a Torus\n\nIn this se tion, we would like to dis uss properties of Pseudodi\u001berential Operators (PDO's) on\na torus. To begin, we examine the nature of PDO's and their symbol lasses. In Rn , we de\u001cne a\nWeyl quantization of an operator a(x, hD) where a \u2208 S(R2n ), a = a(x, \u03be) by:\nZ Z\n1\ni\na(x, hD)u(x) =\ne h hx\u2212y,\u03bei a(x, \u03be)u(y)dyd\u03be,\n(2\u03c0h)n Rn Rn\nfor u \u2208 S and a symbol lass by:\nS\u03b4k (m) = {a \u2208 C \u221e (R2n )k|\u2202 \u03b1 a| \u2264 C\u03b1 h\u2212\u03b4|\u03b1|\u2212k m for all multi-indi es \u03b1},\n\nwhere m : R2n \u2192 (0, \u221e) is is an order fun tion, i.e. there exist onstants C , N su h that\nm(z) \u2264 Chz \u2212 wiN m(w).\n\nWe also have\nS\u03b4\u2212\u221e (m) =\n\n\u221e\n\\\n\nS\u03b4k (m).\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nFor k, \u03b4 = 0 we write simply S(m). On a torus, however, a and all its derivatives are bounded\nin the x variable, thus for h small and k positive, we need not worry about the derivatives in x,\nonly those in \u03be . Also, for k negative, provided that we have the proper lo al regularity for our\nsymbol a, this de\u001cnition still works perfe tly on a torus.\nNote also that we need only work with symbols that are periodi in the x-variable with period\ndetermined by the dimensions of the torus. In other words, a(x, \u03be) = a(x+\u03b3, \u03be) for \u03b3 \u2208 (aZ)\u00d7(bZ),\nwhere a, b \u2208 R. Using this relation, we easily see the following propostion.\n\nIf a(x, \u03be) is a periodi symbol in x with period \u03b3 , then a(x, D)T\u03b3 = T\u03b3 a(x, D)\nwhere T\u03b3 u(x) = u(x \u2212 \u03b3).\nProof. We easily al ulate:\n\nProposition 2.1.\n\n(2.1)\n\na(x, hD)T\u03b3 (u)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\na(x, \u03be)e h <x\u2212y,\u03be> \u00fb(y \u2212 \u03b3)dyd\u03be\n\nZ\n\na(x \u2212 \u03b3, \u03be)e h <x\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u1ef9,\u03be> \u00fb(\u1ef9)d\u1ef9d\u03be\n\ni\n\nRn\n\n(2.2)\n\n=\n\n(2.3)\n\n= T\u03b3 (a(x, D)u)\n\nRn\n\ni\n\n\fEIGENFUNCTIONS FOR PARTIALLY RECTANGULAR BILLIARDS\n\n3\n\n\u0003\n\nFrom the above proposition, it be omes lear that the properties of symbol lasses in Eu lidean\nspa e translate dire tly to properties of similarly de\u001cned symbol lasses on a torus. For instan e,\nwe have the following result.\n\nGiven u(x) = u(x + \u03b3) where \u03b3 is as above, and u is L2 on a torus, then\na(x, hD)u(x) is L on the torus, when a \u2208 S\u03b4 (1), 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 12 .\n\nProposition 2.2.\n\n2\n\nProof. Note that the ondition on a impliesPthat it is L2 bounded. Given a fun tion u(x) whi h\n\nis periodi on a torus, we an write it as \u03b3 T\u03b3 u0 where u0 = \u03c7(x)u(x) and \u03c7(x) is equal to\n1 on a single opy of the torus in the plane and 0 otherwise. Note that no assumptions about\n2\nthe smoothness of\nP \u03c7(x) are made. Hen e, u0 \u2208 L and therefore, so is a(x, hD)u0 . Then,\na(x, hD)u(x) =\n\u03b3 T\u03b3 a(x, hD)u0 . The sum onverges for ea h x sin e a(x, D)u0 will have\nompa t support and we have a(x, hD)u a periodi fun tion that is L2 on the torus.\n\u0003\nUsing similar te hniques, we would like to develop the on ept of a mi rolo al defe t measure\nin this setting. As shown in [11\u2104, we have the following theorem in Eu lidean spa e:\nTheorem 1.\n\nThere exists a Radon measure \u03bc on Rn and a sequen e hj \u2192 0 su h that\n\n(2.4)\n\nw\n\nha (x, hj D)u(hj ), u(hj )i \u2192\n\nZ\n\na(x, \u03be)d\u03bc\n\nR2n\n\nfor all symbols a \u2208 S(1).\nWe all \u03bc a mi rolo al defe t measure asso iated with the family {u(h)}0<h\u2264h0 . Note that\nan S(1) symbol on the torus orresponds to an S(1) symbol on the plane, therefore this result\nproves the existen e of mi rolo al defe t measures on a torus as well.\n\nProof. 1. Let {ak } \u2208 Cc\u221e be dense in C0 (R2n ). Sele t a sequen e h1j \u2192 0 su h that\n1\n1\n1\nhaw\n1 (x, hj D)u(hj ), u(hj )i \u2192 \u03b11 .\n\nThen, sele t a subsequen e {h2j } \u2282 {h1j } su h that\n2\n2\n2\nhaw\n2 (x, hj D)u(hj ), u(hj )i \u2192 \u03b12 .\n\nContinue su h that at the kth step, you take a subsequen e {hkj } \u2282 {hjk\u22121 } su h that\nk\nk\nk\nhaw\nk (x, hj D)u(hj ), u(hj )i \u2192 \u03b1k .\n\nThen by a diagonal argument, arrive at a sequen e hj su h that\nhaw\nk (x, hj D)u(hj ), u(hj )i \u2192 \u03b1k\n\nfor all k = 1, 2, ....\n2. De\u001cne \u03a6(ak ) = \u03b1k . By a standard theorem on operator norms, we have for ea h k that\nw\n|\u03a6(ak )| = |\u03b1k | = lim | < aw\nk u(hj ), u(hj ) > | \u2264 lim sup Ckak kL2 \u2192L2 \u2264 C sup |ak |.\nhj \u2192\u221e\n\nhj \u2192\u221e\n\nThe mapping \u03a6 is bounded, linear and densely de\u001cned, therefore uniquely extends to a bounded\nlinear fun tional on S(1), with the estimate\n|\u03a6(a)| \u2264 C sup |a|\n\n\f4\n\nJ. MARZUOLA\n\nfor all a \u2208 S(1). The Riesz Representation Theorem therefore implies the existen e of a (possibly\nomplex valued) Radon measure on R2n su h that\nZ\n\u03a6(a) =\na(x, \u03be)d\u03bc.\nR2n\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now quote a general theorem about mi rolo al defe t measures on Eu lidean spa e whi h\nwe an then apply to a torus. To state the propagation theorem in the form su\u001e ient for our\nappli ations, we follow [5\u2104.\nLet us onsider a Riemannian manifold without boundary, M .

Let \u03a9 be a partially re tangular billiard with the re tangular part R \u2282 \u03a9, \u2202R =\n\u03931 \u222a \u03932 , a de omposition into parallel omponents satisfying \u03932 \u2282 \u2202\u03a9. Let \u2206 be the Diri hlet or\nNeumann Lapla ian on \u03a9. Then for any neighbourhood of \u03931 in \u03a9, V , there exists C su h that\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n(3.6)\n|u(x)|2 dx ,\n|u(x)| dx \u2265\n\u2212\u2206u = \u03bbu =\u21d2\nC R\nV\nthat is, no eigenfu tion an on entrate in R and away from \u03931 .\n\nProof. Let us take x, y as the oordinates on the stadium, so that x parametrizes \u03932 \u2282 \u2202\u03a9 and\ny parametrizes \u03931 , then\nR = [0, 1]x \u00d7 [0, a]y .\nLet \u03c7 \u2208 Cc\u221e ((0, 1)) be equal to 1 on [\u03b5, 1 \u2212 \u03b5]. Then \u03c7(x)u(x, y) is a solution of\n(3.7)\n\n(\u2206 \u2212 z)\u03c7u = [\u2206, \u03c7]u in R\n\nwith the boundary onditions satis\u001ced on \u2202R.

Sin e a neighbourhood of \u03931 in \u03a9 has to\nontain \u03c9\u03b5 for some \u03b5, (3.6) follows.\n\u0003\n4.\n\nAppli ations\n\nIn [7\u2104 and [8\u2104, Proposition 3.1 is used to prove that in the ase of the Bunimovi h billiard shown\nin Fig.2, the states have nonvanishing density near the verti al boundaries of the re tangle. That\nfollows from Theorem 2 whi h shows that we must have positive density in the wings of the\nbilliard, and the propagation result (in the boundary ase) based on the fa t that any diagonal\nontrols a dis geometri ally (see [7, Se tion 6.1\u2104; in fa t we an use other ontrol regions as\nshown in Fig.2). Here we onsider another ase whi h a identally generalizes a ontrol theory\nresult of Ja\u001bard [14\u2104.\nThe Sinai billiard (see Fig.1) is de\u001cned by removing a stri tly onvex open set, O, with a C \u221e\ndef\nboundary, from a \u001dat torus, T2a,b = (aS1 ) \u00d7 (bS1 ):\ndef\n\nS = T2a,b \\ O .\n\n\fEIGENFUNCTIONS FOR PARTIALLY RECTANGULAR BILLIARDS\n\n7\n\nFigure 2.

Let V be any open neighbourhood of the onvex boundary, \u2202O , in a Sinai billiard, S .\nIf \u2206 is the Diri hlet or Neumann Lapla e operator on S then there exists a onstant, C = C(V ),\nsu h that\nZ\nZ\n\n(4.1)\n\n|u(x)|2 dx \u2265\n\n\u2212h2 \u2206u = E(h)u =\u21d2\n\nV\n\n1\nC\n\n|u(x)|2 dx ,\n\nS\n\nfor any h and |E(h) \u2212 1| < 21 .\nProof. First note that we an easily limit ourselves to the ase where our \u001dat torus has one side\nof length 1 and one side of length a. Suppose that the result is not true, in other words, there\nexists a sequen\ne of eigenfun tions un , kun k = 1, with the orresponding eigenvalues \u03bbn \u2192 \u221e,\nR\nsu h that V |un (x)|2 dx \u2192 0.\nWe \u001crst observe that the only dire tions in the support of the orresponding semi- lassi al\ndefe t measure, \u03bc, have to be \"rational\", in other words, the traje tory must travel along a line\nof slope ma\nn where m, n \u2208 N. The proje tion of a traje tory with an irrational dire tion is dense\non the torus and hen e must en ounter the obsta le \u2202O (and onsequently V ). The propagation\nresult re alled in Proposition 2.3, part (3), gives a ontradi tion by hoosing a proper test fun tion\n\u03c6 whi h is nonzero on the support of the measure \u03bc resulting from our sequen e of eigenfun tions\n(remark that we apply this result as long as the traje tory does not en ounter the obsta le and\nonsequently we need only the interior propagation).\nHen e let us assume that there exists a rational dire tion in the support of the measure whi h\nthen ontains the periodi traje tory in that dire tion. As shown in Fig. 3 we an \u001cnd a maximal\nre tangular neighbourhood of the proje tion of that traje tory whi h avoids the obsta le.\nThe re tangle an be des ribed as R = [0, a1 ]x1 \u00d7[0, b1 ]y1 with the the y1 oordinate parametrizing the traje tory. Let \u01eb, \u03b4 > 0 be small.

Then \u03c7(x, y)u(x, y) is a fun tion on all of R satisfying the periodi ity\nondition. Let \u03a6\u03be (\u03bd) = \u03a6(\u03be \u2212 \u03bd), where we de\u001cne\n\u03a6 = {\u03a6(\u03be) \u2208 Cc\u221e (R2 ) | \u03a6(\u03be) = 1 for \u03be \u2208 B(0, \u03b4), \u03a6(\u03be) = 0 for \u03be \u2208 R2 \\ B(0, 2\u03b4)},\n\nwhere B(0, \u03b4) is a ball entered at 0 of radius \u03b4 .

But \u03bc is invariant by the \u001dow (as long as it does\nnot interse t the obsta le) and hen e, on e we hoose \u01eb, \u03b4 small enough su h that all the ut-o\u001bs\nabove are very lose to the boundary of R, its support an be made interse t any neighbourhood\nof \u2202O.\n\u0003\nNow, from the above theorem, we see the following simple, but important onsequen es:\n\n\fEIGENFUNCTIONS FOR PARTIALLY RECTANGULAR BILLIARDS\n\n9\n\nLet S = T2a,b \\ O where O is su\u001e iently smooth in the ase of Neumann boundary\nonditions, but otherwise la king restri tions. Then, for V any open neighborhood of \u2202O, and\nu a solution of \u2212h2 \u2206u = E(h)u as above, then (4.1) is satis\u001ced. This follows from the above\nargument as the onvexity of the obsta le was never used. Thus, the result holds for any obsta le\n(even onne tedness is not assumed here) and is appli able to the spe ial ase of pseudointegrable\nbilliards (see for instan e [2\u2104 for motivation and des ription). In the next se tion, we use an\nargument similar to that above in order to say even more about on entration along traje tories\nin spe i\u001c pseudointegrable billiards. By an elementary re\u001de tion prin iple, the result also holds\nfor an obsta le inside a square with Diri hlet or Neumann onditions on the boundary of the\nsquare.\nRemark 1.\n\nRemark 2. The proof above gives in fa t the following estimate for any open neighbourhood,\nsay V , of the obsta le:\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u2203C; \u2200u, f \u2208 L2 (S) solutions of (\u2212\u2206 + \u03bb)u = f,\nkukL2(S) \u2264 C kf kL2 (S) + ku1lV kL2 (V )\n\nu\u21be\u2202S = 0\n\u0001\n\nand a ording to [7, Theorem 4\u2104, this implies that the S hr\u00f6dinger equation in S is exa tly\nontrollable by V in \u001cnite time. In fa t, by working on the time evolution equation, we ould\nstrengthen this result allowing an arbitrarily small time.\nThis latter result was previously known [14\u2104 for the parti ular ase \u0398 = \u2205 (S = T2 ) but the\nproof was based on subtle results about Fourier series [15\u2104.\nAs shown in [7, Theorem 2\u2032 \u2104, the results of Ikawa and G\u00e9rard on s attering by two\nonvex obsta les (see [7\u2104 and referen es given there) give an estimate on the maximal on entration of an eigenfun tion (or a quasimode) on a losed orbit in a Sinai billiard. Let \u03c7 \u2208 C \u221e (S; [0, 1])\nbe supported in a small neighbourhood of a losed transversally re\u001de ting orbit. Then for any\nfamily (\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bb)u\u03bb = O(\u03bb\u2212\u221e ), ku\u03bb k = 1,\nZ\n1\n|u(x)|2 (1 \u2212 \u03c7(x))dx \u2265\nC\n,\nlog \u03bb\nS\nRemark 3.\n\nthat is a on entration on a losed traje tory, if at all possible, has to be very weak.\n5.\n\nPseudointegrable Billiards\n\nWe de\u001cne a pseudointegrable billiard to be a plane polygonal billiard with orners whose\nangles are of the form \u03c0n , for any integer n (see [3\u2104). In parti ular, we will be working with the\nbilliard P = T2a,b \\ S where S is a slit that is parrallel to a side of the torus but not a losed loop.\nIn Remark 1, we point out that Theorem 3 allows us to make statements about the L2 mass of\neigenfun tions in a neighborhood of the slit for pseudointegrable billiards. For this parti ular\ntype of billiard, it would be ideal to state that every eigenfun tion must have non-zero mass in a\nsmall neighborhood of the edges of the slit (see Fig. 4). In this se tion, we prove a weaker result\nabout non- on entration along ertain lassi al traje tories in P of semi lassi al defe t measures\nobtained from eigenfun tions u su h that (\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u2206)u = 0 on P .\nAs with the Sinai billiard, the lassi al behavior of traje tories must be taken into a ount\nin our treatment of this problem. There annot be on entration along traje tories that do not\nhit the slit as shown by Theorem 3. If a traje tory has irrational slope, it is dense in P , and\nthus has mass near the edges of the slit as in Se tion 4. Therefore, for our purpose, we on ern\nourselves only with rational traje tories whi h interse t the slit at some point. As we are dealing\nwith periodi boundary onditions, let us onsider the plane tiled with opies of the billiard P .\n\n\f10\n\nJ.

We see that either \u03b31\u2032 is\nbounded in the x-dire tion or \u03b31\u2032 is unbounded in the x-dire tion. Note that this property then\nholds for all \u03b3j , j \u2208 N. For a traje tory \u03b3 , if the resulting path \u03b31\u2032 is bounded in the x-dire tion,\nwe say \u03b3 is x-bounded. We de\u001cne \u03b3 as x-unbounded if \u03b31\u2032 is unbounded in the x-dire tion. See\nFig. 5 for examples. Now, we are prepared to state our theorem on erning the billiard P .\n\nLet \u03b3 be an x-bounded traje tory on P = T2 \\ S . If \u2206 is the Diri hlet Lapla e\noperator on P then there exists no mi rolo al defe t measure obtained from the eigenfun tions on\nP su h that supp (d\u03bc) = \u03b3 .\n\nTheorem 4.\n\n\fEIGENFUNCTIONS FOR PARTIALLY RECTANGULAR BILLIARDS\n\na.\n\nb.\n\n.\n\nd.\n\nAbove, a. and b. represent typi al\n. and d. represent\n\nFigure 5.\n\n11\n\nx-unbounded\n\nx-bounded\n\ntraje tories, while\n\ntraje tories.\n\nSome examples of x-bounded and x-unbounded traje tories.\n\nProof. Let \u03b3 \u2032 be as above. Let V\u01eb be an \u01eb neighborhood of \u03b3 \u2032 . If the theorem were false, we\nwould have a sequen e of eigenfun tions un , kun kL2 = 1 with the property\nZ\n|un |2 dx \u2192 0,\nP \\V\u01eb\n\nfor any \u01eb. We show that this is impossible.\nFor ea h un , we have (\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bbn )un = 0, un |S = 0, un \u2208 L2 (P ). Let \u03c0\u0303 be as above. We de\u001cne\n2\nthe sequen e \u0169n = \u03c0\u0303 \u22121 un . We have (\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bbn )\u0169n = 0, \u0169n |S\u0303 = 0, and \u0169n \u2208 Lper\n(R2 \\ S\u0303).\nIf \u03c02 : S \u2217 (R2 \\ S\u0303) \u2192 S \u2217 (P ) is as above and \u03b3\u0303 = \u03c02\u22121 (\u03b3), then \u0169n \u2192 d\u03bc\u0303 with\nsupp (d\u03bc\u0303) = \u03b3\u0303 \u2282 S \u2217 (R2 \\ S\u0303) .\nNow, let \u03c01\u2217 : S \u2217 (R2 \\ S\u0303) \u2192 R2 \\ S\u0303 be as above. Sele t one traje tory, say \u03b31 . As \u03b31 is\nx-bounded, \u03b31\u2032 = \u03c01\u2217 (\u03b31 ) is ontained in a strip in the plane whi h is in\u001cnite in the y -dire tion\nand bounded in the x-dire tion. Thus, \u03b31\u2032 is ontained in a strip, C0 , with minimal width in the\n\n\f12\n\nJ. MARZUOLA\n\nx-dire tion. Then, \u0169n satis\u001ces (\u2212\u2206\u2212\u03bbn )\u0169n = 0 on C0 , is periodi in the y -dire tion, and satis\u001ces\nthe following boundary onditions in the x-dire tion: Diri hlet boundary onditions along the\nslits that interse t the boundary of C0 and periodi boundary onditions otherwise.\nWithout loss of generality, we an hoose the x- oordinates su h that the boundaries of C0\nare x = \u2212R and x = 0. We an then re\u001de t to a strip, say C\u03031 , with boundaries x = \u2212R and\nx = R, by de\u001cning a new fun tion on C\u03031 by:\n\u001a\n\u0169n (x, y)\nx \u2208 [\u2212R, 0],\n\u0169(1)\n(x,\ny)\n=\nn\n\u2212\u0169n (\u2212x, y) x \u2208 (0, R).\n\nNote that \u0169n is periodi with period 2R. As a result, we have\n(1)\n(\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bbn )\u0169(1)\nn = fn\n\non C\u03031 , where\nWe note that\nDe\u001cne\n\n\u2032\nfn(1) = 2u(0, y)\u03b40\u2032 (x) \u2212 2u(R, y)\u03b4R\n(x).\n(1)\nfn\n\nis supported away from the slits, S\u0303 .\n\u001a\n(x, y)\n\u2212R \u2264 x \u2264 0,\n\u266f\n\u03c01 (x, y) =\n(\u2212x, y) 0 \u2264 x \u2264 R.\n\nIf \u03c01\u266f : C\u03031 \u2192 C0 , then\n[\n(\u03c01\u266f )\u22121 ( \u03b3j\u2032 )\nj\n\nis again a union of paths resulting from disjoint traje tories. Now, we iterate this pro edure a\n\u001cnite number of times, stopping the iteration when the disjoint traje tories in the lift interse t\nea h slit only on e.\nAfter ea h re\u001de tion, we restri t to a new minimal width strip, say Ci . Let us all C\u0303i the strip\nresulting from the ith re\u001de tion. We de\u001cne \u03c0i\u266f : C\u0303i \u2192 Ci\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i < N su h that\n\u001a\n(x, y)\n(x, y) \u2208 Ci\u22121 ,\n\u266f\n\u03c0i (x, y) =\n\u2032\n(2Ri \u2212 x, y) (x, y) \u2208 Ci\u22121\n.\n\u2032\nHere, Ci\u22121\nis de\u001cned as the re\u001de ted strip and x = Ri\u22121 is the line of re\u001de tion for C\u0303i . We\n(i)\nan subsequently de\u001cne fn as a sum of delta fun tions resulting from jumps that o ur after\n(1)\nre\u001de tion, similar to fn above. We also have \u03c0 N : R2 \u2192 CN , the obvious proje tion that results\nafter we tile the plane with opies of CN . So, we have:\n\u03c0\n\n\u266f\n\u03c0N\n\u22121\n\n\u03c0\u266f\n\n\u03c0\u266f\n\n\u03c0\u266f\n\nN\nN\nCN \u2282 C\u0303N \u2192\nCN \u22121 \u2282 C\u0303N \u22121 \u2192 ... \u21922 C1 \u2282 C\u03031 \u21921 C.\nR2 \u2192\n\nNote that\n\n\u22121 \u2032\n\u03c0N\n(\u03b31 ) =\n\n[\n\n\u2032\n\u03b31,j\n,\n\nj\n\n\u2032\nwhere {\u03b31,j\n} is the set of all paths in CN generated by the traje tory \u03b31 and the periodi ity in y .\nAfter a \u001cnite number of re\u001de tions, we \"unfolded\" \u03b31\u2032 to be a periodi line on a large strip,\nCN , whi h does not interse t a slit anywhere. Now, let us hoose \u03a6\u03be , \u03c7, and \u03c70 as above in order\n(i)\nto ut-o\u001b mi rolo ally on this strip around \u03b31 . Again, re all that we an set \u03c7\u03c70 = \u03c7. As fn is\nsupported only in between the slits for ea h i \u2208 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , by hoosing \u03a6\u03be to ommute with\nthe periodi Lapla ian, we have\n\n(\u2212h2 \u2206R \u2212 E(h))\u03a6\u03be \u03c7\u03c70 un = \u03a6\u03be \u03c7fn + [\u2212h2 \u2206R , \u03a6\u03be \u03c7]u = \u03a6\u03be [\u2212h2 \u2206R , \u03c7]\u03c70 u + O(h\u221e ) , kuk = 1 .\n\nThus, the result follows by ontradi tion from the proof of Theorem 3.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fEIGENFUNCTIONS FOR PARTIALLY RECTANGULAR BILLIARDS\n\nIn bold, we have \u03b31 in C0\n\nIn bold, we have\u03b31 in the plane.\nThe union of all tra je tories here gives\n\n\u03b31 in C2 after\nanother re\u001de tion.\n\n\u03b3\u0303 .\n\n13\n\n\u03b31 in the strip C\u03031 . The inhomogeneity resulting from\nre\u001de tion will be supported along the blue lines. Note also that we\nhave ele ted to show only \u03b31 for simpli ity.\n\n\u03b31 as a periodi traje tory in R2 after a \u001cnal re\u001de tion and multipli ation\nby a mi rolo al ut-o\u001b fun tion.\n\nFigure 6. This diagram des ribes how we \"unfold\" the eigenfun tions in order\nto derive a ontradi tion.\nRemark 4. Though this result only shows non- on entration, the proof of Theorem 3 an be\nused to show if \u03b3 is an x-bounded traje tory and u is an eigenfun tion supported on \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03c01 (\u03b3),\nthen in fa t there must be mass at the edges of the slits as desired.\nRemark 5. If instead of a torus, we had Diri hlet boundary onditions on the boundary of\nthe re tangle as well as the slit, then this non- on entration result an also be applied by an\nelementary re\u001de tion prin iple argument.\n\nReferen es\n\n[1\u2104 C.
