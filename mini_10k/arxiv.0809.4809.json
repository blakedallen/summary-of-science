INTRODUCTION\nOver the past twenty years, there have been many efforts to determine the length of the sides and the angles of\nthe well-known Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity triangle for light B mesons [1], which is constructed\nfrom the first and third columns of the CKM quark mixing matrix [2]. At present, good knowledge of the CKM\nangle \u03b2 has been established by the Belle and BABAR collaborations [3]. However, comparable knowledge of the\nother CKM angles \u03b3 and \u03b1 is lacking, due to limited statistics in the decay channels sensitive to these angles, such\nas B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 in the case of \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the case of \u03b1.\nThis paper concerns the determination of CP observables in the decay B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 [4], which provide sensitivity\n\u2217\nto the angle \u03b3 \u2261 arg((\u2212Vud Vub\n)/(Vcd Vcb\u2217 )), using the method developed by Michael Gronau, David London and\nDaniel Wyler (GLW) in the early 1990s [5]. These CP observables are constructed from the measurement of relative\nbranching ratios and from CP asymmetries. Previously, measurements of these quantities, and of \u03b3 by extension,\nhave only been made at the B factories. Since these measurements have been limited by statistical accuracy, the\nexperiments at the Tevatron have an opportunity to contribute significantly to the determination of these quantities,\nparticularly when considering the large amount of B hadron data that remains to be collected and analyzed before\nthe end of Run II. This paper presents the first measurement of the CP observables constructed in B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212\ndecays at a hadron collider, using 1.0 fb\u22121 of data that was collected between February 2002 and February 2006.\n\n2. GLW CP OBSERVABLES\nThe GLW method of determining \u03b3 was developed as a way to reduce the theoretical error on the measurement\nof \u03b3 in B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 decays by using CP-even or odd decays of the D0 . The asymmetry between the B \u2212 and B +\namplitudes of decays to a D0 CP eigenstate can be related to the amplitudes of decays to a flavor-specific D0 decay\nand the angle \u03b3\n0\n0\n|A(B \u2212 \u2192 DCP\nK \u2212 )|2 \u2212 |A(B + \u2192 DCP\nK + )|2 = 2|A(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03040 K \u2212 )||A(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 )| sin \u03b4 sin \u03b3,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the relative final-state interaction phase of the amplitudes to flavor-specific D0 decays. From the right-hand\nside of Eq. (1), it can be seen that there are two possible solutions for \u03b3.\nIn the present measurement, only CP-even decays of D0 are considered, D0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [6].\nThe rates of these decays are normalized to the flavor specific decay D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + through following experimental\nobservables\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 ) + BR(B + \u2192 D\u03040 K + )\n,\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c0 \u2212 ) + BR(B + \u2192 D\u03040 \u03c0 + )\n0\n0\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 DCP\nK \u2212 ) + BR(B + \u2192 DCP\nK +)\n=\n.\n0\n0\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 DCP \u03c0 \u2212 ) + BR(B + \u2192 DCP \u03c0 + )\n\nR =\nR+\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n1\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\nWe can then relate these observables to the CP observables\nR+\n= 1 + r2 + 2r cos \u03b4 cos \u03b3,\nRCP + =\nR\n0\n0\nBR(B \u2212 \u2192 DCP\nK \u2212 ) \u2212 BR(B + \u2192 DCP\nK +)\nACP + =\n0\n0\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nBR(B \u2192 DCP K ) + BR(B \u2192 DCP K + )\n= 2r sin \u03b4 sin \u03b3/RCP + .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere r = |A(B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03040 K \u2212 )|/|A(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 )|.\n\n3. MEASUREMENT OF CP OBSERVABLES AT CDF\nThe CDF II detector is described in detail elsewhere [7]. The data used in the present measurement is collected\nwith a track-based trigger that requires two displaced tracks to satisfy individual and combined minimum transverse\nmomenta thresholds [8]. The relative branching ratios in Eqs. (2) and (3) are measured in a simultaneous maximum\nlikelihood fit, which uses both kinematic information, such as the invariant mass of the B \u2212 system, which is reconstructed as D0 \u03c0 \u2212 , and daughter particle momenta, and the specific ionization of the daughter track from the B \u2212 in\norder to separate kaons and pions.\nTo choose the signal selection requirements, the sensitivity to the primary quantity of interest, ACP + , is optimized\nusing pseudo-experiments. A likelihood fit is performed in the invariant mass window m(D0 \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2208 [5.17, 5.60] GeV/c2 .\nThis requirement reduces backgrounds from decays other than B \u2212 \u2192 D(\u2217)0 \u03c0 \u2212 . Additionally, events which fall\nwithin a \u00b12\u03c3 window around the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + are removed from the sample to reduce contamination in the\nB \u2212 \u2192 D0 [\u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ]K \u2212 . However, it is worthwhile to note that background events from B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + K \u2212 cannot\nbe eliminated and must be included in the likelihood fit.\nSix identical likelihoods are constructed, one set each for B + and B \u2212 and three in each set corresponding to the\n0\n0\n\u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , and D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . \u22122 ln L is simultaneously minimized\n\u2192 K \u2212 K + , DCP\nthree D0 decays considered, DCP\nover all six likelihoods Li , which are written in terms of \"signal\" probability distribution functions (PDFs) FD0 K ,\nFD0 \u03c0 , and FD\u22170 \u03c0 and a background PDF Fbg as\nLi =\n\nN\nev\nY\n\n((1 \u2212 fbg )((1 \u2212 fD0 \u03c0 \u2212 fD\u22170 \u03c0 )FD0 K (\u03b1, ptot , m(D0 \u03c0), \u03ba)\n\nk\n\n+fD0 \u03c0 FD0 \u03c0 (\u03b1, ptot , m(D0 \u03c0), \u03ba) + fD\u22170 \u03c0 FD\u22170 \u03c0 (\u03b1, ptot , m(D0 \u03c0), \u03ba))\n+fbg Fbg (\u03b1, ptot , m(D0 \u03c0), \u03ba)),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the inputs to the fit are the invariant mass m(D0 \u03c0 \u2212 ), the momentum of the D0 plus track ptot = p\u03c0/K + pD0 ,\nthe momentum imbalance \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 p\u03c0/K /pD0 if p\u03c0/K < pD0 and \u03b1 = \u2212(1 \u2212 pD0 /p\u03c0/K ) if p\u03c0/K \u2265 pD0 , and the\ntrack flavor identification variable \u03ba = ((dE/dx)meas \u2212 (dE/dx)exp (\u03c0))/((dE/dx)exp (K) \u2212 (dE/dx)exp (\u03c0)). The fit\nprojections in \u03b1 and \u03ba are shown in Fig. 1 for D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The background PDF in Eq. (6) is expanded\n0\nfor the decays of DCP\n\u2192 K \u2212 K + in order to separate the combinatoric background from the background due to\nB \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + K \u2212 decays. Simulated events are used to model correlations between the variables \u03b1 and ptot in FD0 K ,\nFD0 \u03c0 , and FD\u22170 \u03c0 , while the upper B \u2212 mass sideband is used to model the correlation in the background.\nFrom the likelihood fit, we obtain raw yields for the six decays, two of which are shown in Fig. 2. The ratios R and\nACP + obtained from these yields are corrected using Monte Carlo simulation to account for the relative efficiencies\nbetween the decay modes. Small biases observed in pseudo-experiments, on the level of 1-2%, are corrected for as\nwell.\n\n4. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES\nA number of sources of systematic uncertainty are evaluated for the ratios R, RCP + , and ACP + . The largest\nsources of systematic uncertainty are due to particle flavor identification (dE/dx) and the correlation between \u03b1\n2\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n\nFigure 1: Fit projections of \u03b1 (left) and \u03ba (right) for B + \u2192 [K \u2212 \u03c0 + ]\u03c0 + decays. The green line in both plots indicates the\noverall fit.\n\nFigure 2: Mass fit projections for B + \u2192 [K \u2212 K + ]\u03c0 + (left) and B \u2212 \u2192 [K \u2212 K + ]\u03c0 \u2212 (right). The green line in both plots\nindicates the overall fit.\n\nand ptot in the combinatoric background. The second of these systematic uncertainties is limited by the statistics\nof the invariant mass sidebands, so its knowledge will improve with increased data. The description of the invariant\nmass of the D\u22170 \u03c0 \u2212 is also a significant source of systematic uncertainty in the measurement of R. Other sources\nof systematic uncertainties considered are the uncertainty on the value of the B \u2212 mass [9], the mass model of the\ncombinatoric background, the knowledge of correlations between \u03b1 and ptot in the D0 \u03c0 \u2212 , D\u22170 \u03c0 \u2212 , and D0 K \u2212 PDFs,\nthe small bias observed in pseudo-experiments, and the statistics of the simulated sample used to correct relative\nefficiencies. The systematic uncertainties assigned are listed in Tab. I.\n\n5.
