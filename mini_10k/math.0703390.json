Let B(H) be the Banach algebra of bounded\nlinear operators on H, and let C(H) be the closed ideal in B(H) consisting of\ncompact operators on H. The quotient A(H) = B(H)/C(H) is a C \u2217 algebra\nknown as the Calkin algebra.\nA bounded linear operator T on H is said to be Fredholm if the kernel of\nT is finite-dimensional and T maps H onto a closed linear subspace of H of\nfinite codimension. Sometimes it is convenient to consider unbounded linear\noperators too, such as differential operators. It may also be helpful to include\noperators between different Hilbert spaces. One way to deal with unbounded\nlinear operators is to treat them as bounded linear operators between different\nHilbert spaces.\nIf T \u2208 B(H) is Fredholm, then there is an R \u2208 B(H) such that R T \u2212 I\nand T R \u2212 I are finite rank operators, where I is the identity operator on H.\nConversely, T \u2208 B(H) is Fredholm if there is an R \u2208 B(H) such that R T \u2212 I\nand T R \u2212 I are compact operators. Equivalently, T \u2208 B(H) is Fredholm if and\nonly if the corresponding element Tb of A(H) is invertible.\nThe index of a Fredholm operator T \u2208 B(H) is defined to be the difference\nbetween the dimension of the kernel of T and the codimension of T (H) in H.\nIf T, T \u2032 \u2208 B(H), T is Fredholm, and T \u2032 \u2212 T is compact, then T \u2032 is a Fredholm\noperator with the same index as T . If T, T \u2032 \u2208 B(H), T is Fredholm, and T \u2032 is\nsufficiently close to T in the operator norm topology, then T \u2032 is again Fredholm\nand has the same index as T . The composition of two Fredholm operators is\nFredholm, and the index of the composition is equal to the sum of the indices.\nMany questions in analysis are concerned with invertability of linear operators. One might start by showing that an operator is Fredholm, and then try\nto analyze the kernel and cokernel. These may be considered as nuisances to\nbe minimized. By contrast, from the perspective of topology, nontrivial indices\nare an opportunity.\n1\n\n\fAs in finite dimensions, invertible operators on H form a connected open\nset in B(H). Fredholm operators form an open set that is not connected, with\ndifferent components distinguished by the index.\nThe set of invertible operators on H is in fact contractable [32]. The set of\nFredholm operators is not, and can instead be used as a classifying space for\ntopological K-theory [3].\nFredholm operators occur frequently in the study of integral equations, where\nthey may be given as compact perturbations of multiples of the identity and\nhence have index 0 automatically. However, they may also have nontrivial\nkernels and cokernels, as in the context of elliptic boundary value problems.\nA Toeplitz operator associated to a continuous complex-valued function on\nthe unit circle is Fredholm when the function is nonvanishing. The index of the\nToeplitz operator is equal to the winding number of the function around 0 in\nthe complex plane.\nThere are very interesting ways in which to elaborate some Fredholm operators and get additional indices. One approach applies to operators whose commutators with multiplication operators by continuous functions are compact [2].\nThis permits the operator to be adjusted to act on spaces of sections of vector\nbundles. Another approach deals with homomorphisms from algebras of continuous functions on compact metric spaces into the Calkin algebra [12, 13, 14, 21].\nIn this case there are also operators corresponding to matrix-valued functions\non the space.\nTechniques like these are very important for increasing the information available from an operator or a collection of operators. A basic construction may\nlead to a whole family of indices.\nIt seems to me that there is a lot of room for development of operator theory\non fractals. In particular, there are a lot of interesting fractals with topological\ndimension 1. Of course, many fundamental notions and results of analysis carry\nover to the broad setting of spaces of homogeneous type [16, 17]. Part of the\npoint would be to take advantage of extra structure when it is present, even if\nit is not quite the same as the usual smooth case. There can still be significant\ninteractions with the underlying geometry and topology.\nExtensions of C \u2217 -algebras as in [12, 13, 13, 21] are especially appealing for\nspaces with topological dimension 1, where the higher-dimensional cohomology\ngroups are trivial. It is also nice to be able to view a 1-dimensional space as\nsome sort of boundary of a 2-dimensional space. This includes fractals in the\nplane, and the spaces considered by Bourdon and Pajot [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], for\ninstance. As in these examples, the 2-dimensional spaces may have singularities\nor other complications. At any rate, it would be interesting to have something\nlike complex-analytic metric space involved.\n\nReferences\n[1] L. Ambrosio and P.
