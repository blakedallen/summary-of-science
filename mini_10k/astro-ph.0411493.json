Despite its mean apparent magnitude of mV = 6.39, the evolutionary status of HD 190390 (HR 7671), a luminous\nF-type supergiant at high galactic latitude, is still not very clear, but in most papers a post-AGB classification is assumed.

An extensive abundance analysis\nbased on high resolution, high signal-to-noise NTT+EMMI spectra confirms the metal deficiency of this object ([Fe/H] = \u22121.6),\ntogether with a high lithium content (log \u01eb(Li) = 1.9). A variability analysis based on Geneva photometry over seven years\nreveals beating with a period of \u223c3000 days. It is, however, not clear whether this beating is caused by a stable triplet, or it\nis the consequence of small changes in the main frequency. More recent data obtained with the HIPPARCOS satellite and the\nMercator telescope not only confirm the main period, but also support the presence of a second periodicity of 11 days, which\nwas also found in the Geneva photometry. A conclusive evolutionary status of this object is not given, but alternative to the\nUU Her (i.e. post-AGB) status, a W Vir classification is discussed.\nKey words.

Introduction\nSince their discovery by William Bidelman (1951), the evolutionary stage of HR 6144 (b = +25\u25e6 ), 89 Her (+22\u25e6 ) and\nHD 161796 (+30\u25e6), three high-luminosity stars at moderately\nhigh galactic latitude, has been a matter of debate. At least\nthree different possibilities were suggested: (1) young, massive objects that recently escaped from a star forming region,\n(2) low-mass, evolved objects or (3) a rare product in a binary star scenario. After the high resolution, high signal-tonoise spectroscopic study of Luck, Bond, & Lambert (1990),\nthere was general consensus that these objects are low-mass\nobjects in an evolved, post-AGB evolutionary stage. Although\nno s-process enhancement was observed in these stars, there\nwere enough indications for a classification as a post-AGB star\n(slightly metal-poor, overabundant carbon and oxygen and a\nstrong infrared dust excess indicating high mass loss in a previous evolutionary (AGB) stage).\n\nSend offprint requests to: Maarten Reyniers, e-mail:\nMaarten.Reyniers@ster.kuleuven.ac.be\n\u22c6\nbased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory, La Silla, Chile (programme 61.E-0426), and at the\nObservatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain\n\u22c6\u22c6\nPostdoctoral fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders\n\nTable 1.

(1990)\nfound a clearly different chemical signature than for the other\nthree stars, with a C and O deficiency and a high Li abundance.\nThe authors proposed the object to be a descendant of a Li-rich\nS-type star, with the Li attributed to a \"hot bottom burning\"\nevent.\nIn this paper, new observational material is presented to\nclarify the status of this intriguing object. Both the chemical\ncomposition and the variability are reanalysed, based on high\nquality data coming from different instruments and telescopes.\nIn Sect. 2 we report on the reduction and analysis of our high\nresolution, high signal-to-noise NTT+EMMI spectra and discuss the chemical photospheric composition of HD 190390. In\nSect. 3, a detailed variability analysis is presented, based on\nboth photometric data and radial velocities. Some results are\npresented originating from the new Flemish Mercator telescope\nlocated at La Palma, Spain. Our results are discussed in Sect. 4.\nWe give our conclusions in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Chemical composition\n\n2.1. Previous studies\nLuck, Bond, & Lambert (1990) were the first to carry out a detailed abundance analysis of HD 190390, based on spectra with\nmedium to high resolution (R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb \u2243 15000\u201347000) and a\nsignal-to-noise ratio between 75 and 100. They confirmed the\nmetal deficiency discovered by McDonald (1976) and quantified it: [Fe/H] = \u22121.1. Further, they found a slight C and O deficiency and also claimed a slight s-process enhancement by a\nfactor of 4 above solar. Lithium was also detected with an abundance of log \u01eb(Li) = 2.4. The main shortcomings of this analysis were the quite low signal-to-noise ratio obtained, and the\ninhomogeneous collection of spectra with different resolution,\nleading to quite large line-to-line scatters of the reported abundances (up to 0.92 dex). A more recent abundance analysis was\npresented by Giridhar, Ferro, & Parrao (1997). This analysis\nwas based on moderately high resolution spectra (R \u2243 30000)\nwith a rather narrow wavelength coverage (5260\u20135600 \u00c5), and\nit is therefore rather limited.\nIn the analysis we present here, we avoided the shortcomings of the previous studies: a large spectral domain covered\nwith the same resolution and a high signal-to-noise was used.\nSuch spectra were taken with ESO-NTT telescope and the\nEMMI spectrograph.\n\n2.2. Observations and reduction\nIn the framework of our ongoing program to study the photospheric chemical composition of stars in their last stages of\nevolution (e.g. Van Winckel 2003; Reyniers et al. 2004), high\nresolution, high signal-to-noise spectra were taken with the\nEMMI Spectrograph mounted on the 3.58 m New Technology\nTelescope (NTT) located in La Silla, Chile. The observations\nof HD 190390 were made by Dr. H. Van Winckel during two\nnights in 1998 (see Table 2). The reduction of the data was performed in the specific echelle package \uf765\uf763\uf768\uf765\uf76c\uf76c\uf765 of the \uf76d\uf769\uf764\uf761\uf773 data\n\nTable 2.

Atmospheric parameters and equivalent widths\nSince the atmospheric parameters are usually based on a fine\nanalysis of the iron lines, the Van Winckel & Reyniers list only\ncontains the critical compilation of Lambert (Lambert et al.\n1996), completed with values of Blackwell et al. (1980) for the\nsingly ionised iron lines. Two different methods were used to\nmeasure the equivalent widths: a Gaussian approximation and\ndirect integration. Due to a small asymmetry in the blue wing\n\n\fM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. The spectrum of HD 190390 between 4425 and 4450 \u00c5. A complete line identification of this spectral interval has been attempted by\nthe use of the VALD database (Kupka et al. 1999). Lines of light s-process elements (Sr peak) are shown with a dotted line; lines of heavy\ns-process elements (Ba peak) with a dash-dotted line; lines of other elements (which are mainly \u03b1 and iron peak elements) with a full line. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio of our spectra is around 500.\n\nof the stronger lines, a Gaussian approximation leads to an underestimation of the real equivalent width. This is illustrated\nin the top panels of Fig. 2. On the other hand, a Gaussian approximation allows a better continuum placement (especially\nimportant for weaker lines) and also allows for blends in the\nwing of a line. We have chosen a strictly homogeneous way\nof measuring the equivalent widths of the iron lines: for lines\nwith W\u03bb < 10.5 m\u00c5, we applied a Gaussian approximation, for\nthe other lines we used direct integration, except if the line was\nblended in the wings. 84 Fe \uf769 lines and 24 Fe \uf769\uf769 lines were measured in such way.\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n1\n\nThe effective temperature Teff of the Kurucz model atmosphere (Kurucz 1993) was then obtained by forcing the\nFe abundance to be independent of the excitation potential\nof the lines, the gravity log g by forcing ionisation equilibrium, the microturbulent velocity \u03bet by forcing the Fe\nabundance to be independent of (reduced) equivalent widths.\nAbundance calculations were made with the LTE line analysis program MOOG (version April 2002). This iterative\nprocess finally yielded a model with (Teff , log g, \u03bet , [M/H])\n= (6250 K, 1.0 (cgs), 3.0 km s\u22121 , \u22121.5). E.P. - abundance and\nlog(W\u03bb /\u03bb) - abundance diagrams for this model can be found in\nFig. 2. The model parameters slightly differ from the model parameters found by Luck et al. (1990) and Giridhar et al. (1997).\nThe former authors found (6600 K, 1.5 (cgs), 2.3 km s\u22121 ), the\nlatter (6500 K, 1.25 (cgs), 3.2 km s\u22121 ). However, due to the superior quality of our spectra and the severe selection of our Fe\nline list, we feel confident about our slightly differing parameters. Note that the difference in atmospheric parameters can\nalso be a consequence of the variability of the object.\n\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\n0.94\n6706\n\n6707\n\n6708\n\n6709\n\nFig. 3. [el/Fe] values (upper panel) and lithium doublet synthesis\n(lower panel) for HD 190390. The error on the [el/Fe] values is the\nline-to-line scatter found in Table 3.\n\nThe method of the equivalent width measurement (either\nGaussian approximation or direct integration) for the other\nlines was chosen for each line individually, without a strict criterion. The Van Winckel & Reyniers list was extended for the\ns-process elements in the following way. We extracted all sprocess elements from the VALD database (Kupka et al. 1999).\n\n\f4\n\nM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\nThese lists were then sorted based on the calculated equivalent\nwidths of the lines using the model obtained above and an adhoc abundance value. Each line of these lists was then checked\nin this order on the spectrum of HD 190390, until the lines were\ntoo small to detect. 136 lines of s-process elements were used in\nthe analysis. The oscillator strengths of La and Eu from VALD\nwere replaced by the more recent values published by Lawler\net al. (2001a) and Lawler et al. (2001b) respectively. The total\nnumber of spectral lines used in this analysis is 462. The line\nlist can be obtained from the authors upon request.\n\n2.3.2. Abundance results\nThe resulting abundances are given in Table 3. For each ion\nwe list the number of lines N, the mean equivalent width\nW\u03bb , the absolute abundance log \u01eb (i.e. relative to H: log \u01eb =\nlog X/H + 12), the internal scatter \u03c3, if more than one line is\nused, the solar abundances and the abundance ratio relative to\niron [el/Fe]. The latter values are also graphically presented in\nthe top panel of Fig. 3. For the solar iron abundance we used\nthe meteoritic iron abundance of 7.51; the references for the\nsolar CNO are C: Bi\u00e9mont et al. 1993, N: Hibbert et al. 1991\nand O: Bi\u00e9mont et al. 1991; for Mg and Si the latest Holweger\nvalues (Holweger 2001) were used; for La and Eu we took\nthe recent values derived by Lawler et al. (2001a) and Lawler\net al. (2001b) respectively; other solar abundances were taken\nfrom the review by Grevesse & Sauval (1998). Despite the fact\nthat there are more recent values for some of the solar abundances (especially for the solar CNO), we take these references\nto ensure as much as possible that the g f values that we have\nused in the present paper are consistent with the adopted solar abundances. Note the excellent agreement in abundance for\nelements with two ionisation stages, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr and Ni, indicating a good model parameter choice. Note also the small\nline-to-line scatter which rarely exceeds 0.15 dex, including the\nscatter for the s-process ions.\n\n2.3.3. Lithium synthesis\nThe lithium line in HD 190390 with equivalent width\nW\u03bb = 9.5 m\u00c5 was first reported by Luck et al. (1990). To account for the doublet structure of the line, spectrum synthesis\nis necessary in deriving the Li abundance. The program MOOG\nwas also used for this purpose. The line list is identical to the\nline list that was used in Reyniers et al. (2002), but due to the\ncombined effect of the quite high temperature and the metal\ndeficiency of HD 190390, no other lines are detectable in the\n6707 \u00c5 region.\nFor a spectral synthesis, a broadening factor is needed, in\naddition to the model atmosphere parameters. This broadening factor is a combined effect of the instrumental, rotational\nand macroturbulent broadening. An instrumental broadening\nof 5 km s\u22121 was adopted (the spectral resolution of the EMMI\nspectrograph). The rotational broadening is thought not to be\nvery high due to the supergiant character of HD 190390. The\nmacroturbulent broadening \u03bem was determined in the following\nway. We selected 27 unblended iron lines (neutral and ionised)\n\nTable 3. Abundance results for HD 190390.

For each of these lines, we made a synthesis using the abundance calculated via their W\u03bb . In such way,\nthe macroturbulent broadening is the only free parameter in\nthis synthesis. We found a quite large spread in \u03bem for these\nlines: \u03bem = 8.0 \u00b1 1.2 km s\u22121 . This is also exactly the value found\nin the Luck et al. analysis. Hence for the lithium synthesis\n\u03bem = 8.0 km s\u22121 was used. This yielded log \u01eb(Li) = 1.9.\nAn error analysis on the Li abundance was made by varying\nall parameters involved in the synthesis. As expected, a temperature change has far the largest impact on the abundance:\na temperature variation of \u00b1250 K yields a change in the Li\nabundance of \u223c0.2 dex. Other variations are listed in Table 4.\n\n\fM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\n2.3.4. Europium synthesis\nThe effect of hyperfine splitting (hfs) on the europium abundance was investigated by the synthesis of the two Eu \uf769\uf769 lines\nof our analysis. log g f data and hyperfine splitting constants\nwere taken from Lawler et al. (2001b). The influence of hfs was\ndetermined by integrating the profile of the synthesized line,\nwith and without hfs decomposition. This calculated equivalent width is then compared with the measured equivalent\nwidth. In this way, the exact profile of the line is eliminated, and no broadening factors have to be applied. The effect on abundance of hfs for the resonance line at 4129.725 \u00c5\n(W\u03bb = 43.1 m\u00c5) is significant. A hfs treatment of this line\nyields log \u01eb(Eu) = \u22120.87 dex, while without hfs it is \u22120.79 dex.\nFor the weak line at 6645.064 \u00c5 (W\u03bb = 5.9 m\u00c5), the difference\nbetween an hfs and a non-hfs treatment is not significant.\n\n2.4. Abundances: summary\nReferring to Fig. 3, we will now discuss the derived abundances\nof HD 190390.\nMetallicity With an iron abundance of log \u01eb(Fe) = 5.95,\nHD 190390 is clearly metal deficient by almost a factor of\n40. The other iron peak elements follow this deficiency within\n0.1 dex, except Mn and Zn. The slight manganese deficiency\n([Mn/Fe] = \u22120.3) is expected given the galactic chemical evolution (e.g. Nissen et al. 2000; Prochaska & McWilliam 2000).\nThe zinc abundance ([Zn/Fe] = +0.2) is somewhat higher than\nexpected, but it is based on only three lines.\nCNO Although the abundance of the CNO elements is solely\nbased on very small lines, a clear pattern for these three elements is observed: [C/Fe] = \u22120.6 and [N/Fe] = [O/Fe] = +0.5.\nThe deficient carbon and the overabundant oxygen lead to a\nvery low C/O number ratio: C/O = 0.05. Nitrogen seems to be\nenhanced at the same level as oxygen.\n\u03b1-elements The mean of the [el/Fe] values of the \u03b1-elements\nMg, Si, S, Ca and Ti yields [\u03b1/Fe] = +0.4. This enhancement\nis what is expected for stars in this metallicity range and hence\nthe \u03b1-elements are not intrinsically enhanced. The abundances\nof the individual \u03b1-elements all agree within 0.1 dex with this\n+0.4 number.\nS-process elements A very complete abundance pattern could\nbe obtained for the s-process elements, with 53 lines of the light\n(ls) and 83 lines of the heavy (hs) s-process elements. The sprocess elements are all slightly enhanced, but the abundance\npattern reveals that the enhancement is probably not intrinsic.\nAll elements are compatible with [el/Fe] = 0 considering the\nline-to-line scatters, except Zr, La, Eu and Hf. For Zr, a large\nspread is seen in the [Zr/Fe] of unevolved disk and halo stars\nfrom \u22120.1 to +0.6 dex (e.g. Travaglio et al. 2004). Moreover,\nthe same relatively high Zr abundance is also seen in our analysis of the non-enriched RV Tauri star DS Aqr (Deroo et al.\n2005). Eu is an element with a clear r-process origin, and an\nenhancement of [Eu/Fe] = +0.4 is certainly expected in this\nmetallicity range (e.g. Travaglio et al. 1999). The Hf abundance\nis based on only one very small line and should therefore be interpreted with care. Moreover, the galactic chemical evolution\nof this very heavy element is still unknown. Finally, La seems\n\n5\n\nTable 4. Error analysis of the Li synthesis.

This result\nis contrary to the s-process enrichment claimed by Luck et al.\n(1990). They found a mild enhancement by a factor of 4 compared to solar. A detailed inspection of their results, however,\nreveals large line-to-line scatters for all elements (>0.25, except\nfor Ba) and a smaller number of lines per element. Also, the\nabundances of the s-process elements as determined by Luck\net al. do not display a consistent pattern in the sense that some\nelements are much more enhanced than others. [Sm/Fe]=+2.1\ntogether with [Ce/Fe]=+0.2 is theoretically very difficult to\nreconcile with an s-process signature. We conclude that the sprocess abundances presented here are much more reliable than\nthe ones from the Luck et al. paper.\nLithium The lithium abundance found in this analysis\n(log \u01eb(Li) = 1.9) is 0.5 dex lower than that found in the Luck\net al. analysis. The reason is the higher effective temperature in\nthe latter analysis. Indeed, taking a model with a temperature\nof 6500 K in the Li synthesis, our derived Li abundance rises\nby almost 0.2 dex.\nOther elements Sodium is slightly underabundant, but not at a\nsignificant level (e.g. Carretta et al. 2000). The slight scandium\nenhancement ([Sc/Fe] = +0.1) is not unusual in this metallicity\nrange (e.g. Nissen et al. 2000; Prochaska & McWilliam 2000).\nFinally, the vanadium (V) abundance is quite high, but it is\nbased on only one line.\n\n3. Variability analysis\nHD 190390 has been known to be variable for quite a long time.\nAccording to the SIMBAD database, the variability of this star\nwas first mentioned by Strohmeier et al. (1965) who reported\na photographic range of 0.4 mag. However, dedicated observational efforts to study this variability were made more than\ntwenty years later. Fernie (1986) published an analysis based\non 32 observations in the uvby\u03b2(RI) system and mentions a\nrange in the y magnitude of 0.3 mag and a possible period of\n28.4 or 11.8 days. At nearly the same time, Waelkens & Burnet\n(1985) presented their frequency analysis of 123 measurements\nin the Geneva photometric system (Rufener 1981), obtained\nwith the Swiss photometric telescope at the European Southern\nObservatory. The data covered 1040 days and revealed a most\nsignificant period of 28.49 days, accounting for 80% of the total variance. The residual scatter around the fitted light curve\nwas attributed to irregular cycle-to-cycle variations.\n\n\f6\n\nM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\nFig. 4.

The \uf763\uf76c\uf765\uf761\uf76e periodogram shows a peak at 0.03457 c/d, \u0398 is\nminimal for 0.01729 c/d, which is 1/2 0.03457.\n\nThe frequency analysis was made using different algorithms: the Jurkevich-Stellingwerf \uf770\uf764\uf76d method (Stellingwerf\n1978), the \uf763\uf76c\uf765\uf761\uf76e algorithm (Roberts et al. 1987) and a general multifrequency least squares fitting method (Schoenaers\n& Cuypers 2004). In this analysis, we will give a rough estimate of this error by using the formula given by Montgomery\n& O'Donoghue (1999):\n\u221a\n6\u03c3R\n\u03c3f = \u221a\n(1)\n\u03c0 NAT\nwith \u03c3R the observational error, N the number of measurements, A the amplitude of the signal without noise, T the total\ntime span of the observations. Different forms of this formula\nare given in the literature. Schwarzenberg-Czerny (1991) introduced an extra parameter D in the formula in order to take\ncorrelations in the noise into account. To avoid an underestimation of the calculated error, we took T = N. The motivation is\nthat always N\u2264T for our different data sets of HD 190390, be-\n\nTable 5.

Geneva photometry\nThe photometric data consist of 202 measurements in the\nGeneva photometric system obtained with the P7 photometer\non the (now decommissioned) Swiss photometric telescope in\nLa Silla from September 1982 to August 1988. In a first approach we chose not to add the new Mercator measurements to\nthis data set for two reasons: (1) for the sake of the homogeneity of our data set and (2) there would be a time gap of more\nthan ten years in our data. The Mercator measurements are discussed in a separate section (Sect. 3.4). A small log of the observations is presented in Table 5. The analysis is performed on\nthe V magnitude. We looked for frequencies between 0.01 and\n0.5 c/d using a frequency step of 0.00001 c/d.\n\n3.1.1. Frequency analysis\nAll frequency analysis methods show a highly significant peak\nnear 0.035 c/d, indicated by an arrow in the high resolution \u0398\nstatistic (\uf770\uf764\uf76d) or in the \uf763\uf76c\uf765\uf761\uf76e spectrum in Fig. 4 (a). The results for this frequency f1 are summarized in Table 6. In the\nfollowing, we will use for f1 the value 0.03501 (\u00b10.00001) c/d\n(P1 = 28.56 d). The error estimate is obtained with formula (1).\nf1 accounts for 62% of the total variance. A phase diagram for\nthis frequency is shown in Fig. 6.\nAfter removing (\"prewhitening\") this first frequency from\nthe data, we performed a second frequency analysis on\nthe residuals. We found a new frequency very close to f1 :\nf1\u2032 = 0.03535 (\u00b10.00003) c/d. This frequency is documented in\nTable 6 and Fig. 4 (b). Together with f1 , f1\u2032 accounts for 72% of\nthe total variance (an improvement of 11%). A phase diagram\nfor f1\u2032 is shown in Fig. 6.\nIn the periodograms of the once prewhitened data (Fig. 4,\nb), we note, apart from the peak at 0.03535 c/d ( f1\u2032 ), another peak very close to the main frequency f1 , situated at\n0.03469 c/d. This second peak can easily be seen on Fig. 4\n(c), which is a zoom-in of panel (b). The peak at 0.03469 c/d\nis at the position f1 \u2212 ( f1\u2032 \u2212 f1 ) and therefore it could be the\nthird component of a frequency triplet, together with f1 and\nf1\u2032 . A natural question is then if this frequency is also visi-\n\nFig. 5.

The answer\nis positive for the \uf763\uf76c\uf765\uf761\uf76e spectrum, which has a maximum at\nf1\u2032\u2032 = 0.03457 (\u00b10.00005) c/d. \u0398 is minimal for f = 0.01729 c/d,\nwhich is 1/2 f1\u2032\u2032 (see Fig. 4, d). f1\u2032\u2032 accounts for an additional\n6% of the variance (from 72% to 78%). Other details can be\nfound in Table 6. A phase diagram for this frequency is shown\nin Fig. 6.\nA strong argument for the presence of additional frequencies is given by a simple inspection of Fig. 5. If f1\u2032 and/or f1\u2032\u2032\nare physical, then a beating should be observed with frequency\nfb = f1\u2032 \u2212 f1 = 0.00034 c/d or with a period of Pb \u2243 3000 d. This\nbeating can be seen in Fig. 5: the peak-to-peak amplitude per\nyear clearly varies, reaching its maximum in 1983 (0.355 mag)\nand its minimum in 1986 (0.099 mag). The dashed line is a\nsimple harmonic fit with frequency fb through the extrema (either minimum or maximum) of each year in which observations\nhave taken place.\nIn the periodograms of the once prewhitened data, a prominent peak is also seen at 0.09154 c/d (Fig. 4, b and c). The same\npeak is also present in the twice prewhitened data (Fig. 4, d).\nSince this frequency is not linked to the frequencies around\n0.035 c/d, we can consider this frequency as a genuine second\nfrequency f2 = 0.09154 (\u00b10.00005) c/d. f2 is also the highest\npeak in the \uf763\uf76c\uf765\uf761\uf76e periodogram after removing the three frequencies around 0.035 c/d. A phase diagram for this second\nfrequency is shown in Fig. 6.\n\n3.1.2. Light curves and colour variations\nA light curve was constructed using the four frequencies we\nfound above. The fits were obtained using a simple leastsquares procedure and the results can be seen in Fig. 7. In the\nupper panel of this figure, we show how the light curve behaves globally. The beating is present in the light curve, even\nwhen making use of only two frequencies. However, the amplitude of the beating seems to be underestimated. In this respect,\nthe inclusion of the fourth frequency ( f2 ) improves the global\n\n\f8\n\nM. Reyniers & J.

The frequencies fH1 and fH1\u2032 could\nbe related aliases since the second one is not recovered after\nprewhitening with the first frequency and vice-versa, and there\nis no doubt that the star has a main period of around 28 days.\n\n53 HIPPARCOS measurements of HD 190390 were extracted\nfrom the HIPPARCOS catalogue (ESA 1997). 43 measurements had a non-zero quality flag, but at 10 more epochs the\nstar was 0.10 to 0.15 mag brighter than on average. We have\nno explanation for this brightening, but since we cannot exclude that these brightenings are instrumental, we used only\nthe remaining 34 points. They cover a total time span of 948.6\ndays, from April 1990 to November 1992. The precision of\nthese HIPPARCOS magnitudes (which is also given in the catalogue for each measurement individually) is between 0.005\nand 0.01 mag.\nIt is remarkable that also in this very limited data set,\nthe second best two-frequency solution is the combination\nof fH1 = 0.03704 c/d (PH1 = 27.00 d) and fH2 = 0.09042 c/d\n(PH2 = 11.06 d). These frequencies account for 95.8% of the total variance. The best combination in the least-squares sense,\nfH1\u2032 = 0.07738 c/d (PH1\u2032 = 12.92 d) and fH2\u2032 = 0.09044 c/d\n(PH2\u2032 = 11.06 d) does not give a significantly different result\n\n3.3. CORALIE radial velocities\nThe CORALIE fiber-fed echelle spectrograph at the Swiss\n1.2 m telescope at La Silla has a resolution of \u223c50000 at 5000 \u00c5\nand a wavelength coverage from 3880 to 6810 \u00c5. Due to the\nstability of the whole configuration and the possibility of making simultaneously Thorium-Argon calibration spectra in the\nsecond fibre, the spectrograph is specifically designed for highprecision radial-velocity measurements.\nSince November 1999, 103 radial velocity measurements of\nHD 190390 have been collected (Fig. 9). Velocities are deduced\nby cross-correlating the spectra with an appropriate mask. In\nthe case of HD 190390, an F0 mask is used. Sample correlation profiles for one observational run are given at the bottom\nof Fig. 9.

The frequency found in the frequency analysis (Table 7\nand Fig. 10) is indeed equal to the main frequency found in the\nGeneva photometry.\nVariation of the H\u03b1 profile during a pulsational cycle is often used as a powerful diagnostic tool in the determination of\nthe pulsation character. The CORALIE spectra, however, are\nof too low signal-to-noise (s/n) for a detailed profile variation\nstudy, because the first intention of these spectra was only to\nobtain a radial velocity by cross-correlation. For this purpose,\na s/n of around 30 is sufficient, and the mean s/n of all spectra is\nindeed 40. Nontheless, we can study line profile variations over\na cycle by combining spectra in the same phase bin. In such a\nprocedure, a limited number of higher s/n spectra is compiled\nout of spectra situated in the same phase bin. In the construction of these combined spectra, we chose to use 6 phase bins\ndesignated A to F, illustrated in Fig. 11. The number of spectra\nadded, the total integration time and the achieved s/n ratios are\nsummarized in Table 8. Spectra were first transformed to rest\nwavelength, normalised and then added, s/n weighted.\nFrom Fig. 11 it is clear that H\u03b1 in HD 190390 is variable\nduring a pulsational cycle: relatively strong emission in the\n\nFig. 9.

Geneva photometry with Mercator\nThe Mercator telescope is a 1.2 meter telescope located on the\nRoque de los Muchachos observatory on La Palma, Spain. The\nMercator telescope, operated by our Institute, is a twin of the\n\nSwiss telescope in La Silla. Two instruments are available for\nthe moment: the refurbished photometer P7 which was in use\nat the \"old\" Swiss telescope at La Silla, and a CCD camera.\nHD 190390 is in the standard program catalogue for P7,\nbut since the declination of this object is rather low (-11\u25e636m ),\nthe minimum air mass for La Palma is quite high (Fz = 1.30).\nTherefore, HD 190390 is always measured in concatenation\nwith the standard star HD 190172 (F4III, V=6.72) and the\ncomparison star HD 192771 (G5, V=8.7). 72 measurements of\nHD 190390 have been collected with the Mercator telescope.\nDuring the reduction, a quality flag is assigned to each observation, ranging from 0 to 4. Observations with the lowest quality\n(flag 0) were discarded, and 66 measurements remained, covering 787 days. This data set is still quite limited to perform\na reliable frequency analysis. However, a preliminary analysis\nagain suggests a frequency close to the main frequency found\nin the \"old\" Geneva data: fM = 0.03524 c/d (\u00b10.00005) c/d\n(PM = 28.38 days). This frequency accounts for 86% of the total\nvariance.\nThere is a secondary peak in the periodograms near the\nmain frequency and at 0.0897 c/d an unrelated frequency is\nfound. The best 3-frequency solution (94% reduction of the initial variance) is with 0.03521, 0.04072 and 0.08970 c/d.\n\n3.5. Variability\n3.5.1. Photometry and velocity\nIn Fig. 12 we compare the light curve of HD 190390 with its\nradial velocity curve. The comparison is made for a time interval for which we have both photometric and velocity data, so\nno extrapolation is needed. Both curves are fitted with a simple\nharmonic with the main frequency (0.03501 c/d). It is clear that\nboth curves are mirror images from each other.\n\n\fM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\n11\n\nwell defined. If a very close duplet or triplet of frequencies is\npresent, the total time span of the observations could still be insufficient to resolve the exact frequency values. Alternatively, it\nis not excluded that the main frequency f1 changes its value and\nits amplitude in time in a more or less random way. In this case\nthe nearby frequencies are only \"remnants\" of the broadened\npeak in the periodogram not dealt with by the prewhitening.\nFor the secondary frequency, near 0.09 c/d, we found indications of its presence in independent data sets, and it might\ncorrespond to the frequency f = 0.0847 c/d that was already\nfound by Fernie (1986). Here also its value is either variable\nin time or some beating of closely spaced, so-far unresolved\nfrequencies is present.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Luminosity\n\nFig. 13. Comparison of the new Mercator photometry and the\n\"old\" Geneva photometry. In the upper panel the light curve of\nHD 190390 constructed with four frequencies is extrapolated to the\ntime range covered by the Mercator data (points right on the figure).\nExtrapolation of the light curve is, however, far from robust, since\na small change in frequency will cause a rather large change in the\nglobal behaviour of the light curve in the extrapolated region. In the\nlower panel a harmonic fit with frequency fb = f2 \u2212 f1 = 0.00034 c/d\n(full line) and frequency fb\u2032 = 0.00042 c/d (dotted line) through the extrema (marked on the figure with an open dot) of each year (1982\u2013\n1988) is constructed. The latter frequency is the best fit through the\nextrema, while the former was found in our frequency analysis (see\nTable 6).\n\n3.5.2. Beating in the Mercator data\nTo determine whether the beating is seen in the Mercator data,\nwe extended the light curve constructed in Fig. 7 to the time\nrange covered by the Mercator data (upper panel of Fig. 13).\nWe remind that the amplitude of the light curve seems to be\nunderestimated. Thus, the points of the second observational\nrun on Mercator being quite off the light curve (by \u223c0.12 mag)\nis not an argument to reject a stable beating. Caution is needed\nbecause a small difference in the frequencies will cause a quite\nlarge difference in the global behaviour of the extrapolation.\nAnother and more robust method is depicted in the lower\npanel of the same figure. There, a simple harmonic fit was constructed through the extreme values (either minimum or maximum) of each year (1982\u20131988) and with a fixed frequency of\nfb = f1\u2032 \u2212 f1 = 0.00034 c/d. This fit is then mirrored with respect\nto the mean mV value, and an enveloping curve is obtained.\nThe data points of the second Mercator run again fall out of the\npermitted region, so they do not seem to be compatible with\nthe beating. However, with a small change in the beating frequency ( fb\u2032 = 0.00042 c/d), we were able to make these points\n\"permitted\".\nThus, a beating phenomenon is not excluded although the\nvalues of the frequencies around the main frequency seem not\n\nIn this first section of the discussion, the luminosity of\nHD 190390 is estimated. As a first step, the reddening of the object is quantified by calculating synthetic colour indices. Then,\ntwo different methods are used to obtain the luminosity of our\nobject.\nSynthetic colour indices and reddening The reddening is\nestimated by comparing the observed Geneva colours of\nour object with calculated synthetic colours. Such synthetic\ncolours were calculated by combining the digitized passband\nof the Geneva filters (Rufener & Nicolet 1988) with the\nKurucz model atmospheres (see Reyniers 2002, for more details). The synthetic B-V of HD 190390 with model (Teff ,\nlog g, [M/H]) = (6250 K, 1.0, \u22121.5) is B-V = \u22120.574. The\nmean B-V in our Geneva data is B-V = \u22120.318, hence E(BV) = 0.256 \u00b1 0.05 mag. This value is somewhat higher than the\nvalue derived by Fernie (1986): E(B-V) = 0.10 mag.\nLuminosity with trigonometric parallax The parallax found\nin the HIPPARCOS catalogue (retrieved via SIMBAD) is\n\u03c0 = 2.56 (\u00b10.97) mas, which gives a distance of d = 391 pc, with\nan upper limit of 629 pc and a lower limit of 283 pc. Taking the\nreddening into account, we get an absolute visual magnitude of\nMV = \u22122.29. However, the uncertainty induced by the parallax\nis much larger than the uncertainty of the reddening:\nd = 629 pc \u2192 MV = \u22123.33\nd = 283 pc \u2192 MV = \u22121.60\nAssuming the bolometric correction to be negligible (see e.g.\nFlower 1996), we derive a luminosity of L = 656 L\u2299 . An upper\nlimit is obtained for this method by taking d = 629 pc, which\nyields L = 1701 L\u2299 or log(L/L\u2299) = 3.2.\nLuminosity with P-L-[Fe/H] relation Nemec et al. (1994)\nderived P-L-[Fe/H] relations and distances for several classes\nof Pop. II variables. Given the pulsational properties of\nHD 190390 together with its metal deficiency, there is strong\nevidence that this object belongs to the class of Pop. II\nCepheids (see also Sect. 4.3). The P-L-[Fe/H] relation for this\nclass depends on the pulsation mode (either fundamental or\nfirst-overtone). With the P-L-[Fe/H] relations given in Nemec\net al. (1994), and P = 28.56 d, we obtain\nMV (F) = \u22122.47 (\u00b1 0.07) (fundamental)\nMV (H) = \u22122.92 (\u00b1 0.07) (first overtone)\n\n\f12\n\nM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\nwhere the error of 0.07 only accounts for the error on the P-L[Fe/H] relation. This error is, again, probably underestimated,\nnot only because the variables in the formula are uncertain (especially [Fe/H]), but also because the relation was derived with\ndata from cluster variables. It is therefore not clear if this relation also holds for field stars like HD 190390. Note also that\nwith a maximum magnitude of MV = \u22123, we derive a distance\nof d = 673 pc (log(L/L\u2299) = 3.1 and distance from the galactic\nplane |Z| = 247 pc).\n\n4.2. UU Her classification\nUU Her type stars are defined by Sasselov (1984) as variable\nF-type supergiants at high galactic latitudes having long\nperiods and low amplitudes. Further characteristics of this\ngroup are (Bartkevic\u0306ius 1992):\n\u2013 metal deficiency\n\u2013 high velocities\n\u2013 very specific variability with relatively small amplitudes\nand two or three alternating periods form 20 to 120 days\n\u2013 large infrared (IR) excesses due to circumstellar dust\nHowever, an object does not have to possess all properties mentioned here to be a member of this heterogeneous class. The\nevolutionary status of these stars is not yet clear, but most characteristics clearly point to a final stage of high luminosity or a\npost-AGB stage.\nGiven its low metal content already mentioned by\nMcDonald (1976) and its high galactic latitude, HD 190390\nwas mentioned as a possible UU Her candidate (Waelkens &\nBurnet 1985; Sasselov 1985; Fernie 1986). However, due to the\napparently stable and short period (relative to other UU Her\ncandidates) found by Waelkens & Burnet, the genuine character of HD 190390 as UU Her star was doubted. Moreover,\nHD 190390 has a \"normal\" radial velocity and no significant\ninfrared excess has been observed by IRAS.\nWith the observational material presented here, we are able\nto further contest this UU Her classification. We confirm the\nstable Waelkens & Burnet period of \u223c28.6 d. Our radial velocity data further confirm the \"normal\" velocity of HD 190390.\nAlso the fact that there is no significant reddening is opposite\nto what is seen in most UU Her type stars. Therefore, a\npost-AGB stage of our object is less likely. Also,\n\u2013 the chemical signature does not point to a 3rd dredge-up\nscenario (no carbon or s-process enhancement)\n\u2013 the (however very uncertain) luminosity (not higher than\nlog L/L\u2299 \u2243 3.2) is too low to support a post-AGB stage\nThe absence of a clear 3rd dredge-up signature is, however,\nnot enough to exclude a post-AGB scenario (e.g. Van Winckel\n1997).\n\n4.3. W Vir classification\nW Virginis variables are pulsating stars of population II located\nin the Cepheid instability strip. In the HR diagram, W Vir stars\noccupy a region slightly lower and slightly to the right compared to the classical (Pop. I) Cepheids. Periods are between\n12 and about 20 days and amplitudes between 0.3 and 1.2\n\nmag. W Vir stars are in fact part of the larger class of Pop. II\nCepheids, containing also the BL Her stars at the shorter period\nend (P = 1\u22125 d), and the RV Tauri stars at the longer period end\n(P = 20\u2212100 d); see Wallerstein (2002) for a review of Pop. II\nCepheids. Spectra of W Vir stars sometimes show hydrogen\nand helium emission near maximum light, and double metallic absorption lines, usually explained by the propagation of a\nshock wave through the photosphere.\nThe metal deficiency, the luminosity (too low for postAGB) and most importantly the length of the period itself suggest a W Vir classification for HD 190390. Furthermore, the\nCNO chemical pattern points to a 1st (post-RGB) rather than\na 3rd (post-AGB) dredge up. The (anti-)correlations seen in\nthe colours are reminiscent of variables in the instability strip.\nMoreover, the luminosity inherent to this classification is compatible (within the error) with the luminosity derived by the\ntrigonometric parallax. On the other hand, the spectroscopic\nfeatures seen in W Vir (strong hydrogen and helium emission\nand double metallic absorption lines) are not seen in the spectrum (except the weak emission in the wing of H\u03b1). The photosphere of HD 190390 is seemingly much more stable than that\nof W Vir, and no strong shock wave is developed during the\npulsation.\n\n4.4. Lithium in HD 190390\nIn Sect. 2.3 we derived a Li abundance of log \u01eb(Li) = 1.9. For\nan extensive discussion of Li in evolved stars, we refer to\nSect. 5.2 in Reyniers & Van Winckel (2001). The Li abundance\nof HD 190390 is not higher than the interstellar Li abundance\nof log \u01eb(Li) = 3.1. However, since the initial Li abundance of\nHD 190390 (thought to be the Spite plateau) is approximately\nthe present one, and since at least one mixing event has occurred in HD 190390 (as seen from the CNO pattern), the Li\ncontent is expected to be much lower than the initial one. Note\nthat a Li dilution of a factor of 20 during the 1st dredgeup is expected for stars in this metallicity range (e.g. Gratton\net al. 2000). Therefore, Li production is required in the case of\nHD 190390.\nAn obvious Li producing scenario for HD 190390, which\nwas also invoked by Luck et al. (1990), is a \"hot bottom burning\" (HBB) scenario in which the base of the convective envelope of a AGB star is hot enough for the hydrogen burning to ignite and in which fresh 7 Li is quickly transported to\ncooler layers before it is destroyed by proton capture. However,\nonly AGB stars of intermediate mass (4-5 M\u2299 ) or equivalently\nhigh luminosity Mbol <\n\u223c \u22126 are thought to exhibit this HBB, and\ntherefore such a scenario is difficult to reconcile with a W Vir\nor post-AGB classification. There exists also a class of Li enriched galactic low mass field Carbon stars (Abia et al. 1993;\nAbia & Isern 1997, 2000), but these stars are chemically very\ndifferent from HD 190390.\nTurning to less evolved stars, Li enrichment is also seen in\nabout one percent of \"normal\" G-K giants. Some of these giants show Li abundances even larger than that of the interstellar\nmedium. While the exact mechanism responsible for this enrichment is still not known, internal production of 7 Li is also\n\n\fM. Reyniers & J. Cuypers: The evolutionary status of HD 190390\n\nfor this group of stars most favourable (e.g. de La Reza et al.\n1997). Non-standard mixing models are developed to explain\nthese high Li abundances and commonly dubbed \"cool bottom processing\" (CBP, Wasserburg et al. 1995; Sackmann &\nBoothroyd 1999). An attractive but highly speculative scenario\nfor the Li enhancement in HD 190390 could be a scenario in\nwhich HD 190390 turned into a Li-rich K giant during its ascent on the red giant branch and in which it was able to preserve\nthis Li in its outer layers.\nThe 25.7 day Population II Cepheid V42 in the globular\ncluster M5 (Carney et al. 1998) is a metal poor ([Fe/H] = \u22121.22)\nstar with a surprisingly high Li abundance of log \u01eb(Li) \u2243 1.8.\nNo intrinsic neutron-capture element enhancement was observed either. Using the distance to M5, the authors give an estimate for the mean absolute visual magnitude of MV = \u22123.15.\nApart from these characteristics very similar to HD 190390,\nsome differences are also seen. Oxygen for example is slightly\ndeficient in this star, whereas sodium is enhanced. This could\nbe important evidence that deep mixing has taken place, in\nwhich products of the ON part of the CNO cycle are brought\nfrom the hydrogen-burning shell to the surface.\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper an attempt was made to clarify the evolutionary\nstatus of the luminous F-type supergiant HD 190390. The star\nwas previously classified as a post-AGB star, based on its high\ngalactic latitude and metal deficiency. However, no unambiguous chemical indications were found (carbon and s-process enrichment) to support this view.\nHere, we confirm the main pulsational period of \u223c28.6 d.\nThe high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra confirmed the\nmetal deficiency, the C deficiency, the N and O enhancement\nand the unexpectedly high Li abundance. A detailed abundance\nstudy of the s-process elements indicated a slight s-process enhancement which is in our view probably not intrinsic, but a\nconsequence of the (small) scatter in the galactic chemical evolution. We were not able to give a conclusive evolutionary status for this star, but contrary to the post-AGB classification\nfound in the literature, we suggest a W Vir classification instead.\nAnalysis of the different independent data sets showed\nthat in this star a second periodicity is present near 11.1 d.\nWe suggest that the pulsation has a beating with frequency\nfb = 0.00034 c/d. This could be a working hypothesis guiding\nfuture observations of HD 190390.\nAcknowledgements. MR acknowledge financial support from the\nFund for Scientific Research - Flanders (Belgium).
