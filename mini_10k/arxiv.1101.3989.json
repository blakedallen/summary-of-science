We observe the twisted Alexander polynomial for metabelian representations\nof knot groups into SL2 (C) and study relations to the characterizations of metabelian representations in the character varieties. We give a factorization of the twisted Alexander\npolynomial for irreducible metabelian representations with the adjoint action on sl2 (C), in\nwhich the Alexander polynomial and the twisted Alexander polynomial appear as factors.\nWe also show several explicit examples.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe purpose of this note is to explain explicit forms of the twisted Alexander polynomial of knot exteriors E K for metabelian representations mapping the knot groups into\nSL2 (C). The twisted Alexander polynomial is a refinement of the Alexander polynomial\nof knots defined by using group homomorphisms from the knot groups into linear groups\nas in [Lin01, Wad94]. It is of interest to consider the twisted Alexander polynomial for linear representations which send knot groups to non\u2013abelian subgroups in SL2 (C). We can\nregard irreducible metabelian representations \u03c1 as the simplest ones which have the non\u2013\nabelian images. The author and F. Nagasato have given a characterization of metabelian\nrepresentations in the SL2 (C)-character varieties of knot groups. This characterization is\nsummarized as\n(i) the conjugacy classes of irreducible metabelian representations form the fixed\npoint set under an involution of the character variety of a knot group;\n(ii) every conjugacy class of an irreducible metabelian representation corresponds\nto a non\u2013trivial abelian representation of the fundamental group of the double\nbranched cover over S 3 .\nFrom the viewpoint of a fixed point under the involution in the SL2 (C)-character variety, there exists the induced linear isomorphism on the tangent spaces of the character\nvariety at the fixed point. Under the identification of the twisted cohomology group and\nthe tangent space, this linear isomorphism is given by conjugation between irreducible\nmetabelian representations. To see this, we will make a decomposition of Ad \u25e6 \u03c1 into the\ndirect sum of a 1-dimensional representation and a 2-dimensional one. The 2-dimensional\ndirect summand is defined by another irreducible metabelian representation a\u03c1. The twisted\nhomology group defined by a\u03c1 gives the tangent space with the linear transformation of the\norder 2, namely the scalar multiplication by \u22121.\nDate: June 18, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Moreover we can show that \u2206EK (t)\nhas only even degree terms. This is derived from the property (ii) for irreducible metabelian\nrepresentations and the work of P. Kirk, C. Livingston and C. Herald [HKL10].\nFinally, we will touch on the divisibility of the twisted Alexander polynomial for Ad \u25e6 \u03c1.\na\n\u03c1\n2  \u0304 \u22122 2\nFrom [HKL10], if a knot K is slice, then \u2206\u03b1\u2297\nEK (t) is a Laurent polynomial a f (t ) f (t )(t +\n1) where a is a complex number and f is a Laurent polynomial with complex coefficients.\nIn this case, the factor t2 + 1 makes the twisted Alexander polynomial \u2206\u03b1\u2297Ad\u25e6\u03c1\n(t) be a\nEK\nLaurent polynomial.

Preliminaries\n2.1. Review on the twisted Alexander polynomial. Let K be a knot in the 3-dimensional\nsphere S 3 . We denote the knot group by \u03c01 (E K ) where E K is the knot exterior obtained\nby removing an open tubular neighbourhood of K from S 3 . In this paper, we adopt the\ndefinition of the twisted Alexander polynomial of E K by using Fox differential calculus,\nwhich is due to M. Wada [Wad94].\nWe deal with irreducible SL2 (C)-representations from \u03c01 (E K ) into SL2 (C) and we will\nuse the notation \u03c1 to denote them. Here irreducible means that \u03c1(\u03c01 (E K )) has no proper\ninvariant line in C2 . We also consider the compositions of SL2 (C)-representations with the\nadjoint action on the Lie algebra. The adjoint action is the conjugation on the Lie algebra\nsl2 (C) by elements in SL2 (C):\nAd : SL2 (C) \u2192 Aut(sl2 (C))\n\nA 7\u2192 AdA : v 7\u2192 AvA\u22121\n\nwhere sl2 (C) is regarded as a vector space over C.

Definition of the twisted Alexander polynomial. We review the definition of the\ntwisted Alexander polynomial of a knot K with a representation of the knot group \u03c01 (E K ).\nIt is known that every knot group \u03c01 (E K ) is finitely presentable and expressed as follows:\n\u03c01 (E K ) = hg1 , . . . , gk | r1 , . . . , rk\u22121 i.\n\n(2)\n\nWe choose an SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1 of \u03c01 (E K ) and denote by \u03b1 the abelianization homomorphism of \u03c01 (E K ):\n\u03b1 : \u03c01 (E K ) \u2192 hti = \u03c01 (E K )/[\u03c01(E K ), \u03c01(E K )] \u2243 H1 (E K ; Z)\nwhere \u03c01 (E K )/[\u03c01 (E K ), \u03c01 (E K )] is regarded as a multiplicative group.

We also denote by \u03a6Ad\u25e6\u03c1 the Z-linear extension of\n\u03b1 \u2297 Ad \u25e6 \u03c1.\nDefinition 2.2. Let K be a knot and the knot group \u03c01 (E K ) be represented as in (2). We\nsuppose that \u03b1(gl ) , 1. Then for an SL2 (C)-representation of \u03c01 (E K ), we define the twisted\nAlexander polynomial \u2206\u03b1\u2297\u03c1\nEK (t) as\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u2202ri\ndet \u03a6\u03c1\n\u2202g j 1\u2264i\u2264k\u22121,\n1\u2264 j\u2264k, j,l\n(3)\n\u2206\u03b1\u2297\u03c1\n(t)\n=\nEK\ndet(\u03a6\u03c1 (gl \u2212 1))\n\nwhere the \u2202ri /\u2202g j is a linear combination of words in g1 , . . . , gk , given by Fox differential\nof ri by g j .

The assumption that \u03b1(gl ) , 1 is a sufficient condition for the denominator to\nbe non\u2013zero.\nRemark 2.4. The twisted Alexander polynomial of K for an SL2 (C)-representation of\n\u03c01 (E K ) does not depend on the choices of a presentation of \u03c01 (E K ). Moreover the twisted\nAlexander polynomial has the invariance under the conjugation of representations.\nWe refer to [Kit96, Wad94] for the details on the well\u2013definedness. We choose the last\ngenerator as gl in Definition 2.2 for our explicit examples in Section 5.\n2.2. Review on metabelian representations of knot groups. We are interested in irreducible metabelian representations. This Subsection briefly reviews known results about\nmetabelian representations.\nDefinition 2.5. A representation \u03c1 is metabelian if the image by \u03c1 of the commutator\nsubgroup [\u03c01 (E K ), \u03c01 (E K )] is an abelian subgroup in SL2 (C).\nRemark 2.6.

Lin [Lin01] introduced a useful presentation of knot groups to express irreducible\nmetabelian representations (see Definition 2.7), which is referred as a Lin presentation. Using a Lin presentation, we will see that the composition Ad \u25e6 \u03c1 contains another metabelian\nrepresentation \u03c1\u2032 as a direct summand in Proposition 3.3.\nDefinition 2.7 (Lemma 2.1 in [Lin01]). We suppose that a free Seifert surface S has genus\ng. Let \u03c01 (S 3 \\ N(S )) be generated by x1 , . . . , x2g where each xi corresponds to the core of\n1-handle in the handlebody S 3 \\ N(S ). We denote by \u03bc a meridian on \u2202E K . Then the knot\ngroup \u03c01 (E K ) is expressed as\n(4)\n\n\u03c01 (E K ) = hx1 , . . . , x2g , \u03bc | \u03bca+i \u03bc\u22121 = a\u2212i , i = 1, . . . , 2gi\n\nwhere a\u00b1i are words in x1 , . . . , x2g obtained by pushing up and pushing down the spine\n\u22282g\ni=0 ai of S along the normal direction in N(S ).

Explicit forms of the composition Ad \u25e6 \u03c1 for metabelian representations\nWe start with an explicit form of the composition of an irreducible metabelian representation with the adjoint action. From a Lin presentation of \u03c01 (E K ), the composition with\nthe adjoint action can be decomposed into the direct sum of a 1-dimensional representation\nand a 2-dimensional one.\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03c1 be an irreducible metabelian representation of \u03c01 (E K ) into SL2 (C),\nas expressed by using the correspondence (5) in Proposition 2.8.

Our invariant coincides with the twisted Alexander polynomial replaced the variable t with \u2212t2 in [HKL10,\nTheorem 7.1] (we refer to the formula (7.4) in [HKL10] for changing variables).\n\u0003\nNext we consider the twisted Alexander polynomial for the composition of irreducible\nmetabelian SL2 (C)-representations with the adjoint action. We assume a technical condition called \"longitude\u2013regular\" for SL2 (C)-representations.

From [KL99], it is known that the twisted Alexander\n\u03b1\u2297\u03c8\npolynomial \u2206EK 1 (t) is expressed as the rational function \u2206K (\u2212t)/(\u2212t \u2212 1). We can see\n\u03b1\u2297\u03c8\nthat the twisted Alexander polynomial \u2206EK 2 (t) turns into a Laurent polynomial by Wada's\ncriterion [Wad94, Proposition 8] since there exists a commutator xi such that \u03c82 (xi ) , 1.\nMoreover \u03c82 is conjugate to (\u22121)[*] \u03c82 by the matrix C in Remark 3.2, which implies that the\n\u03b1\u2297\u03c82\n\u03b1\u2297\u03c82\n2\nLaurent polynomial \u2206\u03b1\u2297\u03c8\nEK (t) has the symmetry that \u2206EK (t) = \u2206EK (\u2212t).

It is known that \u2206K (\u22121) is an odd integer. Hence the\nLaurent polynomial Q(t) has a zero at t = 1. Together with the symmetry that Q(t) = Q(\u2212t),\nthis implies that we can factor Q(t) into the product (t \u2212 1)(t + 1)P(t). This factorization of\nQ(t) completes the proof when substituted in (7).\n\u0003\n(7)\n\n=\n\nThe factorization of Theorem 4.2 is deduced from the decomposition Ad\u25e6\u03c1 = \u03c81 \u2295\u03c82 for\nan irreducible metabelian representation \u03c1 in Proposition 3.1.

For any irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1, we\nhave dimC H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) = 1.

If SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1 is irreducible metabelian, then the homology\ngroup H\u2217 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) is isomorphic to the homology group H\u2217 (E K ; V2 ).\nProof. By the decomposition of the chain complex, we have the decomposition of the\nhomology group:\nH\u2217 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) \u2243 H\u2217 (E K ; V1 ) \u2295 H\u2217 (E K ; V2 )\nThe proof follows from the next Lemma 4.8.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.8. The homology group H\u2217 (E K ; V1 ) is trivial.\nProof. The representation \u03c81 is the non\u2013trivial 1-dimensional representation such that a\nmeridian \u03bc is sent to \u22121. Our claim follows from the computation of example 2 in [KL99]\nand \u2206K (\u22121) , 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.9. The conjugation between \u03c1 and (\u22121)[*] \u03c1 induces the linear isomorphism \u2212id\non H1 (E K ; V2 ) (see Remark 3.2).\nThe longitude\u2013regularity of \u03c1 is defined concerning a basis of H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) It was\nintroduced by J. Porti in [Por97]. Here we follow the definition in [Dub05, Yam08].\nDefinition 4.10. An SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1 is longitude\u2013regular if it is irreducible and\nsatisfies the following two conditions on the local system with the coefficient sl2 (C)\u03c1 :\n\n\fON THE TWISTED ALEXANDER POLYNOMIAL FOR METABELIAN REPRESENTATIONS INTO SL2 (C)\n\n9\n\n(i) dimC H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) = 1,\n(ii) the homomorphism H1 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) \u2192 H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ), induced by the inclusion\n\u03bb \u2192 E K , is surjective. Here \u03bb is the preferred longitude on \u2202E K and H1 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 )\nis the homology group for the local system of the circle \u03bb, given by restricting \u03c1\non the subgroup h\u03bbi \u2282 \u03c01 (E K ).\n(iii) If \u03c1(\u03c01 (\u2202E K )) is contained in Para by conjugation, then \u03c1(\u03bb) , \u00b11.\nThe conjugation preserves the longitude regularity of irreducible representations. Proposition 2.8 shows that every irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation sends meridians\nto trace free matrices. Thus we ignore the third condition in Definition 4.10 for irreducible\nmetabelian representations. Proposition 4.6 shows that all irreducible metabelian representations satisfy the condition on the dimension of local system in Definition 4.10.\nWe give more details on the induced homomorphism from H1 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) to the twisted\nhomology group H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ). It is known that the homotopy class of the preferred\nlongitude \u03bb is contained in the second commutator subgroup of \u03c01 (E K ). If an SL2 (C)representation \u03c1 of \u03c01 (E K ) is metabelian, the preferred longitude \u03bb is sent to the identity\nmatrix 1 by \u03c1. Hence we can identify the local system C\u2217 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) with sl2 (C)\u2297Z C\u2217 (\u03bb; Z).\nIt is easy to see the twisted homology group for \u03bb.\nLemma 4.11. If \u03c1 is an irreducible metabelian representation of \u03c01 (E K ) into SL2 (C), then\nthe homology group of C\u2217 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) is expressed as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2sl2 (C) \u2217 = 0 or 1,\nH\u2217 (\u03bb; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ) = \uf8f4\n\uf8f40\n\uf8f3\notherwise.\n\nRemark 4.12. This Lemma 4.11 says that an irreducible metabelian representation \u03c1 is\nlongitude\u2013regular if and only if there exists some v \u2208 sl2 (C) such that v \u2297 \u03bb gives a non\u2013\ntrivial element in H1 (E K ; sl2 (C)\u03c1 ). Here we use the same symbol \u03bb for a lift in a universal\ncover for simplicity of notation.\nBy the long exact sequence for the pair (E K , \u2202E K ) and Proposition 4.6 & 4.7, we have\nthe following short exact sequence of homology groups with coefficient V2 :\n\u03b4\u2217\n\nand\n\ni\u2217\n\n0 \u2192 H2 (E K , \u2202E K ; V2 ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (\u2202E K ; V2 ) \u2212\n\u2192 H1 (E K ; V2 ) \u2192 0\n\ndimC ker i\u2217 = 1, dimC Im i\u2217 = 1.\nBy direct calculation, we have a basis of H1 (\u2202E K ; V2 ) as follows:\nLemma 4.13. Let v1 be an eigenvector E \u2212 F in V2 = hE, Fi for the eigenvalue 1 of \u03c82 (\u03bc).\nThe homology group H1 (\u2202E K ; V2 ) is generated by the homology classes of v1 \u2297\u03bb and v1 \u2297\u03bc.\nHere we denote by the same symbols \u03bb and \u03bc a lifts in the universal cover.\nWe can write any element of ker i\u2217 as a[v1 \u2297 \u03bb] + b[v1 \u2297 \u03bc]. This pair of complex\nnumbers determines the point [a : b] in the projective space CP1 . From Remark 4.12, it\nfollows that an irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1 is longitude\u2013regular if and\nonly if [a : b] , [1 : 0]. We can thus express longitude regularity as the condition that the\nratio b/a is non\u2013zero.\nThe ratio b/a can be expressed as a ratio of 1-forms on the set of conjugacy classes of\nirreducible representations. For each \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (E K ), we define the function I\u03b3 on SL2 (C)representations as I\u03b3 (\u03c1) = tr \u03c1(\u03b3) where \u03c1 is an SL2 (C)-representation. By the invariance\nof trace under conjugation, this function I\u03b3 also gives a function on the set of conjugacy\nclasses of SL2 (C)-representations. Then we have the following condition for an irreducible\n\n\f10\n\nYOSHIKAZU YAMAGUCHI\n\nmetabelian SL2 (C)-representation to be longitude\u2013regular. We refer to [Por97, Proposition 4.7] and its proof for the details.\nProposition 4.14. Suppose that the function I\u03bb is determined by I\u03bc near the conjugacy\nclass of an irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation \u03c1. The ratio b/a satisfies\n!2\n!\nI\u03bc2 \u2212 4 dI\u03bb 2\nb\n= 2\n(8)\na\nI\u03bb \u2212 4 dI\u03bc\n\nTherefore b/a does not vanish at (I\u03bb , I\u03bc ) = (2, 0) if and only if an irreducible metabelian\nSL2 (C)-representation \u03c1 is longitude\u2013regular.\n\nFor example, we can see the relation I\u03bb = \u2212(I\u03bc6 \u2212 6I\u03bc4 + 9I\u03bc2 \u2212 2) in the case that K is the\ntrefoil knot. The right hand side of (8) turns into 36. This means that the ratio b/a is not\nzero at (I\u03bb , I\u03bc ) = (2, 0). Hence every irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation of the\ntrefoil knot group is longitude\u2013regular. In the case that K is the figure eight knot, one can\nsee the relation I\u03bb = I\u03bc4 \u2212 5I\u03bc2 + 2 (we refer to [Por97, Section 4.5, Example 1]). The right\nhand side of (8) turns into 4(2I\u03bc2 \u2212 5)2 /(I\u03bc2 \u2212 1)(I\u03bc2 \u2212 5). This means that the ratio b/a is not\nzero at (I\u03bb , I\u03bc ) = (2, 0). Hence every irreducible metabelian SL2 (C)-representation of the\nfigure eight knot group is longitude\u2013regular.\n5. Examples\nWe show four computation examples from Rolfsen's table of knots. The first two examples are the trefoil knot and the figure eight knot, for which the extra factor P(t) in\nTheorem 4.2 is trivial. Two knots where P(t) is non\u2013trivial are the knots 51 and 52 . In each\nexample, the representation a\u03c1i associated with \u03c1i is given by \u03c1i+1 cyclically.\n5.1. Trefoil knot. Let K be the trefoil knot.

The knot determinant is\n\u2206K (\u22121) = 3. Since the number of conjugacy classes of irreducible metabelian representations is given by (|\u2206K (\u22121)| \u2212 1)/2, we have only one irreducible metabelian representation,\nup to conjugation.
