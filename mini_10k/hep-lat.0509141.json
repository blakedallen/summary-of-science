In another contribution in this conference [2] we present our recent results.\nHere we want to stress some technical aspects, dealing in particular with fermionic observables\ncomputations.\n\nAccording to the Stochastic Quantization approach, we randomly sample the phase-space of\nthe generic field theory with action S[\u03c6 ], according to the Langevin equation:\n\n\u2202 \u03c6 (x,t)\nS[\u03c6 ]\n=\u2212\n+ \u03b7 (x,t) ;\n\u2202t\n\u2202 \u03c6 (x,t)\n\n(1.1)\n\nt can be regarded as a new, non-physical, stochastic time. This sampling is such that the average\nover the gaussian noise \u03b7 leads, for infinite time evolution, to the same expectation values of\nFeynman's path-integrals:\n1\nD[\u03c6 ]O[\u03c6 ] exp{\u2212S[\u03c6 ]} .\nZ\nZ\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nhO[\u03c6\u03b7 (t)]i\u03b7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.2)\n\nPerturbation theory is performed by thinking of the field as a formal power series in the coupling\nconstant \u03bb :\n(n)\n\u03c6\u03b7 (x;t)\n(1.3)\n\u2211 \u03bb n\u03c6\u03b7 (x;t) .\nn\n\nPlugging it in the Langevin equation results in a hierarchical system of differential equations, one\n(i)\nfor each perturbative term \u03c6\u03b7 of the series. We solve it numerically via discretization of the\nstochastic time t = n\u03c4 . Every dynamical variable has to be replaced by its perturbative (truncated)\nexpansion\n(1.4)\nA\n{A(n) }n \u2264 n ,\nthat is by a collection of dynamical variables. Consistently, every algebraic operation has to be performed 'order by order': for additions and scalar-multiplications this simply means to 'vectorize'\nthem,\n(a A)(n) = a A(n)\n(n)\n\n(A + B)\n\n= A\n\n(n)\n\n(1.5)\n\n+B\n\n(n)\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . , n ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhile ordinary multiplications have to be replaced by the (truncated) Cauchy product:\n(A B)(n) =\n\nn\n\n\u2211 A( j)B(n\u2212 j)\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . , n .\n\n(1.7)\n\nj=0\n\nThe need for a collection of variables in the place of a single one makes simulations very memory\ndemanding. Moreover, since the computational effort of each basic operation is increased by the\n108 / 2\n\nPoS(LAT2005)108\n\n1. Langevin evolution\n\n\fFermionic observables in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory\n\nVincenzo Miccio\n\n2. Inverting the Dirac operator: unquenched dynamics and fermionic observables\nOne of the main advantage of NSPT is that it is surprisingly cheap to invert the Dirac operator\nM. This is needed both for fermionic observables computations and unquenched dynamics.\nDuring dynamics, one has to compute the drift term of the Langevin equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\neff\n\u2207a SF = \u2212n f Tr \u2207a M M \u22121\n(2.1)\neff\n\nfor the fermionic action SF = \u2212n f Tr logM. The trick is to recover (2.1) as an average over a\ngaussian noise \u03be\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u0002\neff\n(2.2)\n\u2207a SF = \u2212n f \u03bek\u2020 (\u2207a M)kl M \u22121 l j \u03be j ,\n\nso that one is left with the problem of inverting M over a source: Mk j \u03a8 j = \u03bek . In a perturbative\ncontext, higher orders \u03a8 can be recursively computed starting from the inversion of the 0-order\nonly. The key point is that such a 0-order inversion is the tree-level (lattice) Feynmann propagator,\nwhich does not depend on the field configuration and is diagonal in momentum space. Hence, all\nthe non-locality character of the problem is reduced to an iterative application (back and forth) of\na (fast) Fourier transform (for details, see [1]).\nThe same procedure is needed for the measurement of the quark propagator. Now we do not\nhave to plug a noise \u03be but a \u03b4 -source for each element i of the propagator(1) we are interested\nin: Mk j \u03a8 j = \u03b4ki . A slight generalization of the same procedure can be used to compute fermion\ncurrents. The generic bilinear operator reads:\n\n\u03b4 (M \u22121 G M \u22121 ) \u03b4 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere G is a generic Dirac matrix: G = 1 , \u03b35 , \u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 and \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u221d [\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ]. It can be obtained by\nmeans of suitable scalar products involving again the inverse of Dirac operator:\n(\u03b4 M \u22121 ) G (M \u22121 \u03b4 ) .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThis strategy aims at saving CPU-time, but, as a drawback, it requires a lot of memory. Even if you\nare interested in (a small amount of) diagonal entry (in momentum space) of the current operators,\nyou have to sum over the inner dummy indices, which, as said, extend all over the lattice volume.(2)\n(1) It\n\nis worthwhile to note that we measure propagator in momentum space, as opposed to the non-perturbative\npractice. So in the \u03b4 -source, i is actually a momentum space index.\n(2) As a matter of fact, our APEmille machine does not have enough memory to perform such a computation on-thefly, and so it has to break up the mechanism (carrying out some computations twice). On the other hand, instead, the\nmemory equipment of a PC-cluster can do the job.\n\n108 / 3\n\nPoS(LAT2005)108\n\norder-by-order mechanism, the higher loop one wants to compute, the more expensive simulations\nare. In spite of this, two remarks are in order. First, there are cases where one can take advantage of\nthe perturbative approach (see Sec.2). The second remark is related to parallel-computing, where\ninter-nodes communications represent the bottleneck for a true scalability of performances (and\nhence of the overall computational power). The communications cost is proportional to the amount\nof data to be transferred, i.e. perturbative simulations communication time increases linearly with\nthe maximum perturbative order n. On the contrary, floating point operations increase quadratically\nwith n, namely as n(n \u2212 1)/2. So, as n increases, one improves the ratio between the computation\nand the communication times.\n\n\fFermionic observables in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory\n\nVincenzo Miccio\n\n3. Exploiting the hypercubic symmetry to guide the continuum limit\nIn order to fix ideas, let us focus on the two points vertex function \u03932. From a general point of\nview, with respect to Dirac-spin space, it can be decomposed into its component along the identity\nand the gamma matrices:\n\u03932 = \u0393id + i\u001e\n\u0393 = \u0393id 1 + i \u2211 \u03b3 \u03bc \u0393\u03bc .\n(3.1)\n\u03bc\n\n\u0393id \u223c \u0393id (p2 , m)\n\n(3.2a)\n\n\u0393\u03bc \u223c p\u03bc \u0393(p2 , m)\n\n\u001e\n\u0393\u223c\u001e\np \u0393(p2 , m) .\n\ni.e.\n\n(3.2b)\n\nOn the lattice one has to take into account the smaller hypercubic symmetry W4 , the crystallographic group of the discrete \u03c0 /2 rotations on the six lattice planes of a 4-d hypercubic lattice onto\nitself, with the addition of the reflections. Less symmetry means less constraints, and so more assortment. Within the scalar sector, one has to face combinations of even powers of the momentum\ncomponents:\n(2)\n(3.3a)\nS ( p\u0302) = \u2211 p\u03022\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\nS 1 ( p\u0302) = \u2211 p\u03024\u03bc ,\n(4)\n\n\u03bc\n\nS 1 ( p\u0302) = \u2211 p\u03026\u03bc ,\n(6)\n\n\u03bc\n\nS 2 ( p\u0302) = \u2211\n(6)\n\nS 2 ( p\u0302) = \u2211\n(4)\n\n\u2211 p\u03022\u03bc p\u03022\u03bd\n\n\u03bc \u03bd 6= \u03bc\n\n\u2211 p\u03024\u03bc p\u03022\u03bd\n\n\u03bc \u03bd 6= \u03bc\n\n,\n\nS 3 ( p\u0302) = \u2211\n(6)\n\n,\n\n\u2211 \u2211\n\n\u03bc \u03bd 6= \u03bc \u03c1 6= \u03bc\n\u03c1 6=\u03bd\n\n(3.3b)\np\u03022\u03bc p\u03022\u03bd p\u0302\u03c12\n\n(3.3c)\n\nand so on.(3) Scalar invariants would suffice if we are interested in \u0393id only, since, as said, itself is\na scalar. \u0393\u03bc , in turns, has to transform as a vector under the W4 symmetry, so that one has to take\ninto account any odd(4) powers of p\u0302\u03bc :\n(1)\n\nV\u03bc ( p\u0302) = p\u0302\u03bc ,\n\n(3)\n\nV\u03bc (p) = p\u03023\u03bc ,\n\n(5)\n\nV\u03bc ( p\u0302) = p\u03025\u03bc ,\n\n...\n\n(3.4)\n\nIn the end the expressions (3.2)'s for the \u03932 translate on the lattice into:(5)\n(2n)\n\n\u0393id \u223c \u0393id ( S i )\n\u0393\u03bc \u223c\n\n(2n) (2n+1)\n\u0393\u03bc ( S i , V\u03bc\n)\n\n(3.5a)\n.\n\n(3.5b)\n\nBy restoring physical dimensions, each lattice momentum gets its lattice-spacing factor a in\nfront: p\u0302 = ap.

Therefore, a clear procedure for disentangling each quantity from finite\nlattice-size artifacts relies on a small-momenta expansion, so that only a few of them - the lower\npower ones - have to be really taken into account.

Figure 1 shows two typical examples. The plot on the left represents measurements of (the\nthird perturbative loop of) the critical mass for Wilson fermions. Since it is a scalar quantity, its\nbehaviour is affected only by scalar lattice corrections, and so the picture is quite simpler with\nrespect to the more general case (see next picture). For practical reasons data are shown versus\nthe leading correction only, the momentum square, but the presence of the other invariants shows\nup in the jaggedness of the curve (which indeed does not represent statistical fluctuations of the\nsignal). The plot on the right represents measurements of (the first perturbative loop of) the field\nrenormalization constant, which results from the component along p\u0302\u03bc of \u03932. The situation is quite\nmore involved with respect to the case of a scalar quantity, since here 'vector-like' lattice corrections mix up with the scalar ones. So we have not only the jaggedness of the scalar corrections, but\npoints arrange into different levels according to the value of the component of the momentum in the\ndirection along which the gamma-projection was performed. In simpler words: if the considered\ncomponent of the momentum is equal to just one lattice-momentum-unit, then the associated point\nwill fall on the lower level; if the component is twice, then the associated point will lie on the level\nabove; if the component is three times the lattice-momentum-unit, then the point will lie on the\nnext level; and so on.\n108 / 5\n\nPoS(LAT2005)108\n\n0.0 11.5\n11.0\n1.0 10.5\n-0.85 10.0\n9.5\n-0.80 9.0\n-0.75 8.5\n8.0\n-0.70 7.5\n-0.65 7.0\n-0.60 6.5\n\nVincenzo Miccio\n\n\fFermionic observables in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory\n\nVincenzo Miccio\n\n4.

Hence, the right prescription to get\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nzs is to subtract \u03b3s log( p\u03022 ) from os , for each momentum, before taking the continuum limit.\nActually, finite volume effects has to be taken into account as explained in [2]. With these finite\nquantities, now, a little algebra (and the previous computed quark wave-function renormalization\n(1)\nfactors) allows to extract zs . As order increases the algebra become somewhat more and more\ninvolved. In any case, at each order one is always able to extract the renormalization constant, in\nterm of a finite number of log-subtractions.\n\nReferences\n[1] F. Di Renzo & L.
