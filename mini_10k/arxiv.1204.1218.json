Introduction\n\nThe TRD [1] of the ALICE experiment [2] at the LHC\nis devoted to electron identification [3] and tracking of\ncharged particles. It provides also Level-1 triggering on electrons and jets [4]. It is a cylindrical detector system located\nin radius between 2.9 and 3.7 meters from the beamline\nand segmented in 6 layers. It has a 2\u03c0 azimuthal coverage\nin 18 super-modules and a polar coverage between 45\u25e6 and\n135\u25e6 in 5 stacks (Fig. 1).\n75' VWDFN\n\n75' VXSHUPRGXOH\n\n75' FKDPEHU\n73& KHDW VKLHOG\n\n72)\n\nFig. 1.

The depths of the drift and amplification regions are 3 cm and 0.7 cm respectively. The induced\ncharges are readout by cathode pads which have a typical\nsize of 0.7\u00d78.8 cm2 (Fig. 2) every 100 ns. A charged particle\nloses energy in primary collisions with gas atoms by ionization (dE/dx). Energetic ones with \u03b3 above 103 in addition\nemit TR photons when passing through the radiator. The\nradial positions of the primary clusters are reconstructed\nfrom the drift time. Therefore besides the energy loss measurement, the TRD is also used for momentum determination. The TRD signals presented in the following sections\nare the integrated charge over all drift time corrected for\nthe non-perpendicular incident angle.\n2. TRD Signals from Testbeam Measurement and\nProton-Proton Collisions\nThe testbeam measurement was carried out at CERN's\nPS in 2004 [5] with secondary beams of pions and electrons\nof momenta from 1 to 10 GeV/c. The setup is shown in\nFig. 3. Prototype chambers without (with) radiators were\nused for the dE/dx (dE/dx+TR) measurement.\nIn Figure 4 the TRD signal distributions from 3 GeV/c\ntestbeam pions and electrons are shown.

TRD Signals from Cosmic Muons\n0\n\nThe TRD energy loss measurements in the testbeam and\nproton-proton runs described in Section 2 do not cover\nthe \u03b2\u03b3 range 102 \u2013 103 which can be filled in by cosmic muons. Because the ALICE detector is situated underground with 28 meters of material above, cosmic rays\nwhich leave long trajectories in the ALICE Time Projection\nChamber (TPC) [8] are predominantly muons. Because the\nTR photons are emitted in direction of the passage, they\nenter the drift section and are absorbed by the heavy gas\nwhen the particle traverses the radiator first. Contrarily,\nonly the dE/dx signal is measured when the particle traverses the drift section and then the radiator.

In order to measure the muon minimum ionization signals in the TRD, cosmic runs with a magnetic field\nof 0.1 T were conducted. The momentum is determined by\nthe standard TPC-TRD tracking, which in addition to the\nstandard TPC tracking also takes into account the space\npoints in the TRD. This is the first ALICE running at 0.1 T.\nThe most probable TRD signals from cosmic muons are\nshown in Fig. 9. By comparing the dE/dx and dE/dx+TR\nsignals, the TR onset is observed at \u03b2\u03b3 > 700.\n\nFig. 7.

Summary\nWe have presented an overview of the energy loss signals\nin the ALICE TRD, measured with prototypes in a testbeam and with the actual detector in proton-proton collisions and cosmic runs in the ALICE setup at the LHC. In\nthe cosmic ray measurement we exploit the geometry of the\ndetector to measure separately the dE/dx and dE/dx+TR\nsignals in the TRD. In addition, a combined track fit within\nthe ALICE TPC was developed to exploit the full length of\nthe track, leading to a 1/pt -resolution of 8.1\u00d710\u22124 c/GeV\nat momentum 1 TeV/c. The TR from TeV cosmic muons\nis unambiguously observed. We have shown numerical descriptions of the signal spectra and of the dependence of\nthe most probable energy loss on \u03b2\u03b3, which will allow to\nestablish reference distributions for particle identification\nwith TRD over a broad momentum range.\n\n1\n0.5\n\nReferences\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n\u03b2\u03b3\n\nFig. 11.
