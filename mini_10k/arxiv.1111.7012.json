Within the past thirty years there have been numerous theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies of Hall effects in plasmas. Experimental, numerical,\nand theoretical research on Hall plasmas have focused on planar rather than more complicated geometries.\nWhistler drift modes propagate as a shock wave via density gradients in a Hall plasma [1].\nHowever, the same drift modes, which propagate as shocks, and whistler-like modes with\nperiodicity, may also be seen when considering curvature effects in the absence of density\ngradients. Whistler-like modes with curvature effects have been shown to be important in\nmagnetic reconnection in the earth's magnetosphere [6, 7], and Hall physics is important\nin characterizing reconnection [8, 9]. Linear studies of Hall physics in a low-ionized, highdensity protostellar disk[10, 11] (i.e. cylindrical geometry) have shown that the whistler\nfrequency is also an important parameter in the stability of the rotating disk, and comprehensive numerical studies [12, 13] have borne this out.\nRudakov and others [14\u201316] have analyzed whistler and whistler drift modes with planar\ngeometry and inhomogeneities in astrophysical dusty plasmas. This paper continues work\ndone by Rudakov[17] and analyzes the nonlinear axisymmetric structure of whistler and\nwhistler drift modes. For simplicity, we construct Hall magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions for an electron-ion plasma, but initially demonstrate their applicability to low-ionized\nastrophysical plasmas.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. (II), we review appropriate dimensional normalizations (length, time, speed, magnetic field) for an electron-ion Hall plasma.\nIn subsequent subsections we describe changes in physics, and corresponding changes in\nscalings, that expand the applicability of Hall MHD to low-ionized electron-ion-gas plasmas (protostellar disks) and to dusty plasmas (protostellar jets). In Sec. (III) we derive\nthe generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, first introduced in [17], as an interesting class of\nsolutions to an axisymmetric Hall plasma. In Sec. (IV) we discuss interesting new solutions\nto the GGS beyond those described in [17]. The concluding section, Sec. (V), summarizes\nthis paper's results and illuminates an alternative explanation of what has been though to\n2\n\n\fbe magnetic bubbles [18] moving along protostellar jets.\n\nII.\n\nHALL PHYSICS AND LENGTH SCALES\n\nIn a standard electron-ion Hall plasma, magnetic fields are tied to the electron, rather\nthan fluid, velocity. As a result, unlike in MHD, we may get penetration of the magnetic\nfield into the bulk medium. Furthermore, for this traditional Hall plasma, one gets these\nscalings\n\u2022 The frequency of Hall phenomena are normalized in units of \u03c9ci = Zi eB0 / (mi c), the\nion cyclotron frequency. Zi e is the charge of the ion, B0 is the magnetic field strength,\nmi is the proton mass, and c is the speed of light.\n2\n\u2022 Length scales are in units of di = c/\u03c9pi , the ion inertial skin depth, where \u03c9pi\n=\n\n4\u03c0e2 ni /mi is the ion plasma frequency. ni is the ion number density.\n\n\u221a\n\u2022 Velocities of Hall magnetic structures are in units of vA , where vA = B0 / 4\u03c0nmi is\nthe Alfv\u00e9n velocity.\n\u2022 Magnetic diffusion is given by the following expression,\nDm =\n\nme \u03bdei c2\n.\n4\u03c0e2 ni\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bdei is the electron-proton collision frequency and me is the electron mass.\nThese scalings are also summarized in Eq. (12). Sec. (II A) and (II B) describe the lowionized astrophysical plasmas in which Hall MHD phenomena may be observed. Different\nphysics results in different dimensional scalings of Hall MHD phenomena. Most notably,\nin these low-ionized plasmas, magnetic diffusion is achieved through ion-gas and dust-gas\ncollisionality, rather than electron-ion collisionality (see, e.g., [11, 14, 19] for a review).\n\nA.\n\nLow Ionized Hall Plasmas\n\nIn low ionized plasmas, charged particles make up only a minority of the number and mass\ndensity of the total medium. In general the electric field consists of inductive, Hall, Ohmic,\nand ambipolar components. In order that the low-ionized plasma may be approximated by\n3\n\n\fa resistive Hall MHD electric field (Ohmic and Hall electric fields) with negligible ambipolar\nelectric fields, the ions must remain collisionally coupled to the gas while electrons must\nremain collisionally uncoupled. Using estimates of those physical regimes in a low-ionized\nplasma where either the inductive, Hall, ambipolar, or Ohmic electric fields dominate [11],\nresistive Hall MHD plasma dynamics may occur where \u03bdeg \u03bdig \u226b \u03c9ci \u03c9ce and \u03c9ce \u226b \u03bdeg . \u03bdig\nand \u03bdeg are the ion-gas and electron-gas collisional frequencies, and \u03c9ce is electron cyclotron\nfrequency.\nIn low-ionized plasmas whose electric fields are resistive Hall MHD in nature, the following\nsubstitutions to an electron-ion Hall plasma are made.\n\u2022 We replace \u03bdei with \u03bdeg in Eq. (1).\n\u2022 The ions are coupled to the gas, so that the Alfv\u00e9n velocity is calculated over the denp\nsity of gas particles vAg = B0 / 4\u03c0mg ng , where mg and ng are the averaged molecular\nmass and number density of gas particles, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Since Hall plasma time scales are scaled with respect to the ion cyclotron frequency,\nthe Hall length scale (the largest length scale over which we can observe Hall effects)\nis given by this relation:\nvAg\nc\nl\u223c\n\u2248\n\u03c9ci\n\u03c9pi\n\n\u0012\n\nmg\nmi\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nng\nni\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(2)\n\nThe collision rates for electrons and ions are given in [20, 21], where A is the molecular/atomic mass of the principal ion:\n\u03bdig =ng h\u03c3viig\n=2.6 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22129\n\n\u0012\n\nA\n1amu\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03bdeg =ng h\u03c3vieg\n=8.28 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221210\n\nT\n1K\n\n(3)\n\u22121\n\ns\n\n(4)\ns\n\n\u22121\n\nIn a typical protostellar disk, ng \u223c 1012 \u2212 1013 cm\u22123 [22], magnetic fields are of order 10\n- 100 mG (see [23] for scaling of magnetic fields in molecular clouds), so that we have a\nHall plasma. Most of the ions in low-ionized astrophysical plasmas are alkali ions[22, 24],\ngiving an ion mass mi \u223c 30. For T \u223c 30K, gas density ng = 1013 cm\u22123 , assuming a standard\n4\n\n\fcosmic-ray ionization \u03b6 = 10\u221217 s\u22121 [25], ion density ni \u223c 1 cm\u22123 [10, 26]. Here \u03bdig \u223c 1.4\u00d7105\n\ncm\u22123 . For B = 100 mG, \u03c9ci = 30 s\u22121 \u226a \u03bdig . Furthermore, since \u03bdei = 2.6 \u00d7 104 s\u22121 and\n\u03c9ce = 1.8 \u00d7 106 s\u22121 , \u03bdeg \u03bdig \u226b \u03c9ci \u03c9ce and we may completely neglect the ambipolar electric\nfield in the induction equation. The upper threshold for Hall effects L \u223c 5 AU (7.5 \u00d7 1013\n\ncm), comparable to the scale of temperature and density gradients in the outer parts of a\nprotostellar disk.\n\nB.\n\nPhysical Regimes of Dusty Plasmas\n\nApproximately 1% of the interstellar medium in our galaxy is composed of dust[27].\nRudakov [14] showed how to apply the results of electron-ion Hall plasmas to dusty plasmas. It is important to note that although dust may not be a primary charge carrier in\na low-ionized astrophysical plasma, their large masses, small charges, and relatively small\nnumber densities opens up a length and time scale over which the dust remains unmagnetized (whether through long dust gyroperiod or through collisional coupling with interstellar\ngas) while the faster and smaller-scale electrons and ions remain fixed to the magnetic field\n\u2013 hence dusty Hall MHD physics. The following changes to the standard electron-ion Hall\nMHD scaling must be made,\nni \u2192 nd\neZi \u2192 ezd\n\n(5)\n\nvi \u2192 vd\nDm \u2192 Dm,d =\n\n\u03bdig md c2\n\u0002\n\u0003.\n4\u03c0e2 ni (zd nd /ni )2 + (\u03bdig /\u03c9ci )2\n\nnd and md are the number density and mass of dust particles (of a single mass and size), zd\nis charge per dust particle, and vd is the velocity of the dust. In the limit of low temperature\n< 100 K), zd = \u22121. Dusty plasma behaves as a Hall plasma if nd /ni \u226b \u03bdig /\u03c9ci\nplasmas (T \u223c\n\n[14]. The dust inertial scale, the lower limit over which we may apply Hall physics, is\n(Md c2 /4\u03c0e2 nd zd2 )\n\n1/2\n\n= c/\u03c9pd , where \u03c9pd is the dust plasma frequency.\n\nIn the limit that the Lorentz force on a dust particle (evd B/c) is smaller than the drag\nforce acting on the dust (a2 vg,th mg ng vd , where a is the size of a dust grain):\neB\n< a2 vg ng\nmg c\n\n(6)\n5\n\n\fThen the dust is collisionally coupled to the gas. In this limit, the dusty plasma Hall\nlength scale c/\u03c9pd increases by a factor (mg /md )1/2 (ng /nd )1/2 , similar to the length scale\nof the low-ionized gas in Eq. (2). mg and ng are the masses and number densities of gas,\nrespectively.\nDense molecular clouds have a hydrogen gas density of nH \u223c 103 \u2212 106 cm\u22123 (see, e.g.\n[19, 27]). Given a standard cosmic ray ionization \u03b6 = 10\u221217 s\u22121 [25] at temperature T = 30\nK, this implies an ion density ni \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 cm\u22123 [10, 26]. For these gas densities, the\nmagnetic fields are on the order of 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22123 G [23, 27]. For a representative molecular\n\ncloud density ng = 103 cm\u22123 at T = 10 K with representative grains of size a = 0.03 \u03bcm, we\n\nget densities [26] ne = ni = 10\u22123 cm\u22123 , nd = 10\u22128 cm\u22123 , and magnetic fields B = 10\u22124 G.\nAssuming densities of dust at 3 gm/cm3 , this gives an average dust mass md = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221215\n\ngm. Furthermore, the length scale of Hall phenomena is (Md c2 /4\u03c0e2 nd zd2 )\n\n1/2\n\n= c/\u03c9pd \u223c 1000\n\nAU. Although the density and temperature model inside protostellar disks is still open to\nquestion, we have somewhat better estimates of the density of gas at the edges of protostellar\ndisks and in protostellar jets. We are taking the grain radius of a = 1 \u03bcm that scatters visible\nlight efficiently. Since we have marginal extinction due to the scattering of light by the dust,\nRnd a2 \u223c 1 and so nd \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22123 . The length scale for Hall phenomena calculated over\nthis mass and density is c/\u03c9pd \u223c 1000 AU. However, this length scale is smaller than that\ncalculated because the Hall physics is dominated by smaller dust particles. The usual dust\nsize distribution function is nd (a) \u221d a\u22123.5 [28], and the length scale c/\u03c9pd changes as a3 .\nIII.\n\nHALL DYNAMIC EQUATIONS\n\nWe consider the electron-ion Hall plasma, using a cylindrical geometry and fluid equation\nfor electrons. The Hall dynamic equations in this form were first written in [17]. Here, we\nbegin with the Hall frozen-in equations with magnetic diffusion expression Dm in Eq.

The additional\nterm in the GGS arises due to the electric field (see Eq. [17]) acting on the moving strucRr\nture. This appears as an additional poloidal current, \u2212u 0 n (r \u2032 ) r \u2032 dr \u2032, in the frame of the\npropagating solution, where the motionless ions are seen moving with velocity \u2212uez .

It must be emphasized that in MHD the magnetic field is frozen into\n\nthe plasma and cannot move relative to the ions, so there is no additional force. The GGS\nequations were first found in [17] as exact solutions of the dynamic equations for the Hall\nmagnetic field in an axisymmetric geometry, Eq. (10) and (11).\n\nIV.\n\nAXISYMMETRIC HALL MHD SOLUTIONS\n\nHere, we consider solutions of the GGS, that propagate down a cylindrical column. We\nhave three sets of analytic solutions. Sec. (IV A) details the resistive nonlinear shock whose\nstructure is described by a Burgers equation. Sec. (IV B) describes a periodic solution to the\nGGS equation with linear current term H(\u03a8) \u221d \u03a8. Sec. (IV C) numerically estimates, with\njustification on the basis of the Chandrasekhar-Fermi theorem[29], nonlinear localized bubble\nsolutions to the GGS integral. According to this theorem, a localized MHD equilibrium\n9\n\n\fplasma magnetic structure could exist only in the presence of an external magnetic field or\nwith fixed metal wall boundaries.\n\nA.\n\nResistive Nonlinear Shock\n\nAgain, assume a Hall plasma column, so that the magnetic fields are given by Eq. (11)\nand (10), with a constant-density plasma within the column r < R and vacuum outside.\nFurthermore, let us assume only the toroidal field B exists with profile B(r, z, t) = B(z, t)r/R\nand B(\u2212\u221e, t) = \u2212B0 , where B0 > 0. Thus, we get the Burger's equation in normalized\ncoordinates:\n\u2202B\n2B \u2202B\n\u22022B\n=\n+ Dm 2\n\u2202t\nR \u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(21)\n\nWith this solution, in normalized coordinates:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\uf8f1\nB0 r\nB0 (z \u2212 B0 t/R)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ntanh\n\u22121\nr<R\n2RDm\nB(r, z, t) = 2R\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\nr>R\n\n(22)\n\nIn dimensional values the shock velocity is given by u = cB0 / (4\u03c0enR) and shock thickness\n\u03b4 = 2\u03bdei /\u03c9ce R. Note that the shock is moving in the positive z direction in our coordinate\nsystem. This asymmetry is typical for Hall phenomena. Furthermore, one may construct\nanalytic solutions for any arbitrary initial configuration B(z, 0) (see e.g. [4, 30] for the\nHopf-Cole transformation that transforms Burger's equation into a heat diffusion equation).\nA plot of the toroidal magnetic structure of this resistive case is shown in figure 1, with\nu = 100 and b0 = B0 /R = 100.\n\nB.\n\nPeriodic GGS Solution\n\nHere, we consider solutions to the GGS equation (see Eq. [20] and [19]) with linear current\nterms, H(\u03a8) = k\u03a8. Note that this solution arises from a particular choice of current term,\nand does not arise from a linearization of the dynamic equations (Eq. [11] and [10]).

The soliton structure consists of a three-component\nmagnetic field (a poloidal field and a toroidal field) that is localized about the origin with\na span much smaller than the dimensions of the cylindrical volume; thus, Br \u2192 0, Bz \u2192 0,\nand B\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212 21 ur at the boundaries of the cylinder.

To guarantee a localized\n\nsolution we require that H(\u03a8) \u2265 0. The case analyzed in this section is H (\u03a8) = \u03a82 \u2265 0.\n\nNote that the form of Eq. (28) or (29) is as if we consider a nonlinear 3D Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation with the m = 1 azimuthal modes (i.e. solutions \u223c ei\u03c6 ). Here, to estimate the form\nof the soliton, we use the same variational method and trial functions, described below, for\n3D nonlinear optical solitons [31, 32]. First, we derive the Lagrangian that describes the\nGGS equation with nonlinear current. Then we look for localized solutions with different\ntest functions. One reasonable approximation for the test function in cylindrical coordinates is A(r, z) = U(r) sech \u03bcz. A one-dimensional differential equation in r is derived by\n14\n\n\faveraging that Lagrangian with respect to z and searching for a localized one-node solution,\npresumed to be the main lowest-energy stable solution, for a given \u03bc. We solve for that \u03bc\nthat minimizes the integral of the averaged Lagrangian over r. Another test function is in\n\u221a\nspherical coordinates, A(\u03c1, \u03b8) = U(\u03c1) sin \u03b8, where \u03c1 = r 2 + z 2 and cos \u03b8 = z/\u03c1. Again a\none-dimensional equation in \u03c1, and its localized single-node lowest energy solution, is derived\nby averaging and minimizing the Lagrangian of the GGS. A more detailed description of the\nestimation method for both trial functions is provided in the Appendix.\nPlots of the dependence U(r), the cylindrical ansatz, and U(\u03c1), the spherical ansatz,\nare shown in Fig. 3. Contours detailing the shapes of the toroidal vector potential A(r, z)\nfor both trial functions are shown in Fig. 4. The cylindrical ansatz U(r) sech \u03bcz and the\nspherical ansatz U(\u03c1) sin \u03b8 have approximate shapes in the radial coordinate. As in [31],\nthere is a substantial differences in the shape of the cylindrical and spherical trial functions\nof the soliton. The shape of the cylindrical and spherical trial functions look similar to their\ncorresponding solutions of the optical solitons found in [31]. Both trial functions also satisfy\n\u0001\nthe scaling A (r, z; \u03bc, \u03b1) = (\u03b1/u)1/2 A0 u1/4 r, u1/4 z .\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nHere we have explored possible structures that arise in a Hall plasma due to curvature\nrather than, say, density gradients. We have provided a general structure to continue further\nanalysis of the dynamic Hall modes in Eq. (10) and (11) as well as the generalized GradShafranov (GGS) integrals in Eq. (19) and (20) and propagating solutions with constant\nvelocities in the z direction.\nWell-understood Hall plasma phenomena such as whistler drift modes were shown to\nexist in an homogenous cylindrical plasma column. Furthermore, an exact solution for the\nwhistler drift mode, the Burgers nonlinear shock wave, was discussed in subsection IV A.\nPeriodic solutions were shown in subsection IV B from a simple analysis of the allowable\nsolution for linear current in the GGS integrals. We find that the solution is constrained by\nthe radial vacuum boundary of a Hall plasma column, because in Hall physics the magnetic\nfield is carried solely by the electrons.

Although the finer features are obviously different, the width in the radial direction are\nroughly similar.\n\nsearch may apply this suggested method to other localized soliton-like solutions, as well as\nilluminate relationships between the magnetic fields and vertical velocities in propagating\nlocalized Hall structures. The Hall dynamic equations in Eq. (10) and (11) may be useful\nin analyzing the stability of the soliton solutions estimated here.\nWe have also included some space plasmas in which the Hall regime may be important.\nIn Earth's lower ionosphere, whistler drift modes due to density gradients (at the equator)\nor curvature (at the magnetic poles) may exist. In astrophysical plasmas, such as molecular\nclouds, protostellar disks, or protostellar jets, Hall phenomena may exist due to the presence\nof charged dust.\nAxisymmetric Hall phenomena may play an important role in the circumstellar disks\nand jets pictured by the Hubble Space Telescope around young stellar objects. The typical\ncircumstellar disk has a radius of a few hundred AUs \u2013 a possible length scale in Hall phenomena. Hall shocks and other magnetic structures also transport of currents and magnetic\nfields through matter without compression or net mass motion. A comparison of the radio\nfrequency Doppler studies of the bipolar jets around HH30 show that the bulk velocity of\nthe matter is five times slower than the velocities of the observed jet substructures [33].\n\n17\n\n\fFurthermore, radio polarization measurements of the jets emanating from the disks of GM\nAurigae and DG Tauri imply largely toroidal magnetic fields[34], which may be explainable\nas a nonlinear shock wave and structures rather than the traditional model of a supersonic\nfluid or MHD shock.\nOther explanations for the fast-moving, time-resolved substructures in the jets of T Tauri\nstars involve \"bullets\" of plasma that emanate from the disk [18]. Furthermore, a variety\nof MHD jet models are given in the literature (see, e.g. [18, 35, 36]). Astrophysical MHD\nexperiments of pressure-confined toroidal magnetic towers (see, e.g., [37, 38]) may explain\nfeatures of these jets as specific MHD phenomena: higher intensity material within the jet\nas magnetic bubbles, and longer-timescale intermittency because kink and other azimuthal\nMHD instabilities collapse the jet structure. Here, due to the obvious presence of dust,\nwe imply an alternative model, magnetic penetration into a Hall plasma, that may explain\nsome of these observed structures. A companion astrophysical paper will expand upon the\nilluminating relationship between net Hall magnetic bubble velocity, radial dimension, and\nmagnetic field strength to explain the migration of observed \"bullets\" seen in protostellar\njets.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank L.

This\nvariational method and trial functions were borrowed from [31]. Furthermore, the integration\nof the one-dimensional functions was performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method\nfrom r = 0 to r = 10 for the cylindrical ansatz and \u03c1 = 0 to \u03c1 = 10 for the spherical ansatz.\n\n1.\n\nCylindrical Coordinate Ansatz\n\nThe Lagrangian of the differential expression (29) is given by,\n1\n1\nA2 1\n1\nL (\u2202r A0 , \u2202z A0 , A0 ; r, z) = r (\u2202r A0 )2 + r (\u2202z A0 )2 + 0 + r 3 A20 \u2212 r 3 A40\n2\n2\n2r\n2\n2\nWith this ansatz,\nA0 (r, z) = U(r) sech (\u03bcz) ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\nwe get the averaged Lagrangian L1 , where U \u2032 = dU/dr:\n\u0012 \u00132\nZ \u221e\nr dU\nU 2 r 3 2 2r 3 4\n\u03bcr\n(A.3)\nL1 =\nL (\u2202r A0 , \u2202z A0 , A0 ; r, z) dz =\n+ U \u2212\nU\n+ U2 +\n\u03bc dr\n3\n\u03bcr\n\u03bc\n3\u03bc\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIf we vary L with respect to U and dU/dr we then have a differential equation in r:\n1 dU\nU\n1\n4\nd2 U\n+\n\u2212 2 \u2212 \u03bc2 U \u2212 r 2 U + r 2 U 3 = 0\n2\ndr\nr dr\nr\n3\n3\n\n(A.4)\n\nThe solutions that we look for are given by the\nlim U(r) = U \u2032 (0)r\n\nr\u21920\n\nlim U(r) = r\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u22121\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\nexp \u2212 r\n2\n20\n\n\fWe employ the shooting method, with free parameter U \u2032 (0), by integrating out Eq. (A.4)\nfrom r = 0 to some sufficienly large r = rlim \u226b w, where w is the width of the structure.\nFurthermore, since we postulate the lowest-energy solutions are probably dominant, we look\nfor solutions that have a single node in U(r).\nFor each \u03bc there is a unique single-node solution U(r; \u03bc) satisfying Eq. (A.4). To solve\nfor this problem, we require that the averaged Lagrangian Eq. (A.3), averaged over r, must\nbe extremized with respect to \u03bc:\nZ \u221e\n\u2202L1\ndr = 0\n\u2202\u03bc\n0\n\n(A.6)\n\nIf we use these functions:\nZ \u221e\n\u01eb1 (\u03bc) =\nrU (r; \u03bc)2 dr\nZ0 \u221e\n\u01eb2 (\u03bc) =\nr 3 U (r; \u03bc)2 dr\nZ0 \u221e\n\u01eb3 (\u03bc) =\nr 3 U (r; \u03bc)4 dr\n\n(A.7)\n\n0\n\nWe then get the relation,\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\nZ \u221e\n1\n2\nU2\ndU\n+ 2 dr = \u03bc2 \u01eb1 (\u03bc) \u2212 \u01eb2 (\u03bc) + \u01eb3 (\u03bc) .\nr\ndr\nr\n3\n3\n0\nHowever, using (A.4) one can derive this relation,\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\ndU\ndU\n1\nd\n4\nU2\nr\nrU\n\u2212 \u03bc2 rU 2 \u2212 r 3 U 2 + r 3 U 4 .\n+ 2 =\ndr\nr\ndr\ndr\n3\n3\n\n(A.8)\n\n(A.9)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (A.9) into the integral on the left hand side of Eq. (A.8), and noting that\nthe first right hand side term in Eq.
