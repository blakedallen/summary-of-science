Given a pair of adjoint functors between two arbitrary categories it induces mutually inverse equivalences between the full subcategories of the initial ones, consisting of objects for which the arrows\nof adjunction are isomorphisms. We investigate some cases in which\nthese subcategories may be better characterized. One application is the\nconstruction of cellular approximations. Other is the definition and the\ncharacterization of (weak) \u2217-objects in the non additive case.\n\nIntroduction\nIn mathematics the concept of localization has a long history. The origin\nof the concept is the study of some properties of maps around a point of a\ntopological space. In the algebraic sense, the localization provides a method\nto invert some morphisms in a category. Making abstraction of some technical set theoretic problems, given a class of morphisms \u03a3 in a category A,\nthere is a category A[\u03a3\u22121 ] and a functor A \u2192 A[\u03a3\u22121 ] universal with the\nproperty that it sends any morphism in \u03a3 to an isomorphism. This functor\nwill be called a localization, if it has a right adjoint, which will be frequently\nfully faithful. Dually this functor is called a colocalization provided that it\nhas a left adjoint.\nOne of the starting point of this paper is the observation that the consequences of the duality between localization and colocalization were not\nexhausted. For example the concept, borrowed from topology, of cellular\napproximation in arbitrary category is a particular case of a colocalization,\nfact remarked for example in [4]. Some results concerning the cellular approximation may be deduced in a formal, categorical way by stressing this\nduality. On the other hand the same formal techniques are useful in the\nstudy of so called \u2217-modules, defined as in [3].\nNow let us present the organization and the main results of the paper.\nIn the first section we set the notations, we define the main notions used\nthroughout of the paper and we record some easy properties concerning\nthese notions.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 18A40, 20M50, 18G50.\nKey words and phrases. adjoint pair; localization; colocalization; cellular approximation; \u2217-act over a monoid.\nThe author was supported by the grant PN2CD-ID-489.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nIn Section 2 are stated the formal results, on which it is based the rest\nof the paper. There are three main results here: First Theorem 2.4 where\nare given necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of adjoint functors\nto induce an equivalence between the full subcategories consisting of colocal\nrespectively local objects with respect to these functors (for the definition\nof a (co)local object see Section 1). Second and third Proposition 2.10 and\nTheorem 2.11 which represent the formal characterization of a non additive\n(weak) \u2217-object.\nSection 3 contains a non additive version of a theorem of Menini and\nOrsatti in [7]. Consider an object (or a set of objects) A of a category\nA, and the category of all contravariant functors [E op , Set] where E is the\nfull subcategory of A containing the object(s) A, situation which is less\ngeneral but more comprehensive that the hypotheses of Section 3. Under\nappropriate assumptions, mutually inverse equivalences between two full\nsubcategories of A and [E op , Set] are represented by A in the sense that\nthey are realized by restrictions of the representable functor HA = A(A, \u2212)\nand of its left adjoint (see Theorem 3.2).\nProvided that A is a cocomplete, well copowered, balanced category with\nepimorphic images, and A is a set of objects of A, it is shown in Section 4 that\nthe inclusion of the subcategory of HA -colocal objects has a right adjoint\n(see Theorem 4.2). Consequently fixing an object A in such a category,\nevery object X will have an A-cellular approximation.\nIn Section 5 we define and characterize the notions of a (weak) \u2217-act\nover a monoid, in Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 5.3, providing in this way\na translation of the notion of (weak) \u2217-module in these new settings. It\nis interesting to note that our approach may be continued by developing\na theory analogous with so called tilting theory for modules. The Morita\ntheory for the category of acts over monoids is a consequence of our results.\n1. Notations and preliminaries\nAll subcategories which we consider are full and closed under isomorphisms, so if we speak about a class of objects in a category we understand\nalso the respective subcategory. For a category A we denote by A\u2192 the category of all morphisms in A. We denote by A(\u2212, \u2212) the bifunctor assigning\nto any two objects of A the set of all morphisms between them.\nConsider a functor H : A \u2192 B. The (essential) image of H is the subcategory Im H of B consisting of all objects Y \u2208 B satisfying Y \u223c\n= H(X)\nfor some X \u2208 A. In contrast we shall denote by im \u03b1 the categorical notion\nof image of a morphism \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2192 . A morphism \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2192 is called an Hequivalence, provided that H(\u03b1) is an isomorphism. We denote by Eq(H)\nthe subcategory of A\u2192 consisting of all H-equivalences. An object X \u2208 A\nis called H-local (H-colocal) if, for any H-equivalence \u01eb, the induced map\n\u01eb\u2217 = A(\u01eb, X) (respectively, \u01eb\u2217 = A(X, \u01eb)) is bijective, that means it is an isomorphism in the category Set of all sets. We denote by C H and CH the full\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n3\n\nsubcategories of A consisting of all H-local, respectively H-colocal objects.\nFor objects X \u2032 , X \u2208 A, we say that X \u2032 is a retract of X if there are maps\n\u03b1 : X \u2032 \u2192 X and \u03b2 : X \u2192 X \u2032 in A such that \u03b2\u03b1 = 1X \u2032 . We record without\nproof the following properties relative to the above considered notions:\nLemma 1.1. The following hold:\na) Eq(H) is closed under retracts in A\u2192 .\nb) Eq(H) satisfies the 'two out of three' property, namely if \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A\u2192\nare composable morphisms, then if two of the morphisms \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2\u03b1\nare H-equivalences, then so is the third.\nc) The subcategory C H (respectively CH ) is closed under limits (respectively colimits) and retracts in A.\nMoreover if every object of A has a left (right) approximation with an\nH-local (colocal) object, in a sense becoming precise in the hypothesis of the\nLemma bellow, then we are in the situation of a localization (colocalization)\nfunctor, as it may be seen from:\nLemma 1.2. If for every X \u2208 A there is an H-equivalence X \u2192 X H with\nX H \u2208 C H (respectively, XH \u2192 X with XH \u2208 CH ), then the assignment\nX 7\u2192 X H (X 7\u2192 XH ) is functorial and defines a left (right) adjoint of the\ninclusion functor C H \u2192 A (CH \u2192 A). Moreover the left (right) adjoint of\nthe inclusion functor sends every map \u03b1 \u2208 Eq(H) into an isomorphism and\nit is universal relative to this property.\nProof. Straightforward. (The first statement was also noticed in [5, 1.6]).\n\u0003\nIn the sequel we consider a pair of adjoint functors H : A \u2192 B at the\nright and T : B \u2192 A at the left, where A and B are arbitrary categories.\nWe shall symbolize this situation by T \u22a3 H. Consider also the arrows of\nadjunction\n\u03b4 : T \u25e6 H \u2192 1A and \u03b7 : 1B \u2192 H \u25e6 T.\nNote that, for all X \u2208 A and all Y \u2208 B we obtain the commutative diagrams\nin B and A respectively:\n\u03b7H(X)\n\n(1)\n\nT (\u03b7Y )\n\n// (H \u25e6 T \u25e6 H)(X)\n// (T \u25e6 H \u25e6 T )(Y )\nH(X) O\nT (Y ) N\nOOOO\nNNN\nNNNN\nOOO\nand\n\u03b4T (Y )\nH(\u03b4X )\n1H(X) OOO\n1T (Y ) N NN\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\nH(X)\nT (Y )\n\nshowing that H(X) and T (Y ) are retracts of (H \u25e6 T \u25e6 H)(X), respectively\n(T \u25e6 H \u25e6 T )(Y ). Corresponding to the adjoint pair considered above, we\ndefine the following full subcategories of A and B:\nSH = {X \u2208 A | \u03b4X : (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u2192 X is an isomorphism},\nand respectively\nS T = {Y \u2208 B | \u03b7Y : Y \u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) is an isomorphism}.\n\n\f4\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nThe objects in SH and S T are called \u03b4-reflexive, respectively \u03b7-reflexive.\nNote that H and T restrict to mutually inverse equivalences of categories\nbetween SH and S T and these subcategories are the largest of A and B\nrespectively, enjoying this property.\n2. An equivalence induced by adjoint functors\nIn this section we fix a pair of adjoint functors T \u22a3 H between two\narbitrary categories A and B, as in Section 1.\nLemma 2.1. The following inclusions hold:\na) SH \u2286 Im T \u2286 CH \u2286 A.\nb) S T \u2286 Im H \u2286 C T \u2286 B.\nProof. a) The first inclusion is obvious. For the second inclusion observe\nthat for all \u01eb \u2208 Eq(H) and all Y \u2208 B the isomorphism in Set\u2192\n\u01eb\u2217 = A(T (Y ), \u01eb) \u223c\n= B(Y, H(\u01eb))\nshows that \u01eb\u2217 is bijective. The inclusions from b) follow by duality.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.2. Let C be a subcategory of A such that the inclusion functor\nI : C \u2192 A has a right adjoint R : A \u2192 C and the arrow of the adjunction\n\u03bcX : (I \u25e6 R)(X) \u2192 X is an H-equivalence for all X \u2208 A. Then \u03bcX is an\nisomorphism for all X \u2208 CH , and consequently CH \u2286 C.\nProof. Let X \u2208 CH . Since \u03bcX \u2208 Eq(H), we deduce that the induced map\n\u03bc\u2217X : A(X, (I \u25e6 R)(X)) \u2192 A(X, X)\nis bijective, consequently there is a morphism \u03bc\u2032X : X \u2192 (I \u25e6 R)(X) such\nthat \u03bcX \u03bc\u2032X = 1X . Since R \u25e6 I \u223c\n= 1C naturally, and \u03bc is also natural, we\nobtain a commutative diagram\n\n\u03bcX\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nX\n\n(I\u25e6R)(\u03bc\u2032X )\n\n// (I \u25e6 R \u25e6 I \u25e6 R)(X)\nUUUU\nUUUUU\n\u03bc(I\u25e6R)(X)\nUUU\nUUUU\n\u000f\u000f\n// (I \u25e6 R)(X)\n\n(I \u25e6 R)(X) U\n\n\u03bc\u2032X\n\nshowing that \u03bc\u2032X \u03bcX = 1(I\u25e6R)(X) , hence \u03bcX is an isomorphism.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.3. If S T = Im H then SH = CH . Dually if SH = Im T then\nS T = CT .\nProof. Consider an arbitrary object X \u2208 A. By hypothesis H(X) \u2208 S T , so\n\u03b7H(X) is an isomorphism. Together with diagrams (1), this implies H(\u03b4X )\nis an isomorphism. Thus \u03b4X : (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u2192 X is an H-equivalence, and\nwe know (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u2208 Im T \u2286 CH . As we learned from Lemma 1.2, this\nmeans that the assignment X 7\u2192 (T \u25e6 H)(X) defines a right adjoint of the\ninclusion of CH in A. If in addition X \u2208 CH , then \u03b4X is an isomorphism by\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n5\n\nLemma 2.2, proving the inclusion CH \u2286 SH . Since the converse inclusion is\nalways true, the conclusion holds.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4. From the proof of Lemma 2.3 we can see that the condition\nS T = Im H implies that the functor A \u2192 CH , X 7\u2192 (T \u25e6 H)(X) is the right\nadjoint of the inclusion functor of SH = CH into A. Dually if SH = Im T ,\nthen the functor B \u2192 C T , Y 7\u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) is the left adjoint of the inclusion\nfunctor of S T = C T into B.\nTheorem 2.5. The following are equivalent:\n(i) S T = C T .\n(ii) S T = Im H.\n(iii) SH = CH .\n(iv) SH = Im T .\n(v) The functors H and T induce mutually inverse equivalence of categories between CH and C T .\nProof. The equivalence of the conditions (i)\u2013(iv) follows by Lemmas 2.1 and\n2.3. Finally the equivalent conditions (i)\u2013(ii) are also equivalent to (v),\nbecause SH and S T are the largest subcategories of A and B for which H\nand T restrict to mutually inverse equivalences.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.6. The adjoint functors T \u22a3 H induce mutually inverse equivalences CH \u21c4 B if and only if T is fully faithful. Dually the adjoint pair\ninduces equivalences A \u21c4 C T if and only if H is fully faithful.\nProof. The functor T is fully faithful exactly if the unit of the adjunction\n\u03b7 : 1B \u2192 (H \u25e6T ) is an isomorphism, or equivalently, S T = B. Now, Theorem\n2.5 applies.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6 generalize [1, Theorem 1.6 and Corollary\n1.7], where the work is done in the setting of abelian categories, and the proof\nstresses the abelian structure. These results may be also compared with [9,\nTheorem 1.18], where the framework is also that of abelian categories.\nWe consider next other two subcategories of A and B respectively:\nGH = {X \u2208 A | \u03b4X : (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u2192 X is an epimorphism},\nG T = {Y \u2208 B | \u03b7Y : Y \u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) is a monomorphism}.\nThe dual character of all considerations in the present Section continues to\nhold for GH and G T .\nLemma 2.7. The following statements hold:\na) The subcategory GH (respectively G T ) is closed under quotient objects\n(subobjects).\nb) Im T \u2286 GH (respectively Im H \u2286 G T ).\nProof. a) Let \u03b1 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be an epimorphism in A with X \u2032 \u2208 GH . Since \u03b4\nis natural, we obtain the equality \u03b1\u03b4X \u2032 = \u03b4X (T \u25e6 H)(\u03b1), showing that \u03b4X is\nan epimorphism together with \u03b1\u03b4X \u2032 .\n\n\f6\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nb) From the diagrams (1), we see that \u03b4T (Y ) is right invertible, so it is an\nepimorphism for any Y \u2208 B. Thus Im T \u2286 GH .\n\u0003\nThe subcategory GH of A is more interesting in the case when A has epimorphic images, what means that it has images and the factorization of a\nmorphism through its image is a composition of an epimorphism followed by\na monomorphism (for example, A has epimorphic images, provided that it\nhas equalizators and images, by [8, Chapter 1, Proposition 10.1]). Suppose\nalso that A is balanced, that is every morphism which is both epimorphism\nand monomorphism is an isomorphism. Thus every factorization of a morphism as a composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism is\na factorization through image, by [8, Chapter 1, Proposition 10.2]. With\nthese hypotheses it is not hard to see that the factorization of a morphism\nthrough its image is functorial, that means the assignment \u03b1 7\u2192 im \u03b1 defines\na functor A\u2192 \u2192 A.\nProposition 2.8. If A is a balanced category with epimorphic images, then\nthe functor A \u2192 GH , X 7\u2192 im \u03b4X is a right adjoint of the inclusion functor\nGH \u2192 A.\nProof. By hypothesis im \u03b4X is a quotient of (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) and H(T (Y )) \u2208 GH ,\nso the functor A \u2192 GH , X 7\u2192 im \u03b4X is well defined, by Lemma 2.7. Let\nnow \u03b1 : X \u2032 \u2192 X in A\u2192 , where X \u2032 \u2208 GH and X \u2208 A. Since \u03b4X \u2032 is an\nepimorphism, it follows\nim \u03b1 = im (\u03b1\u03b4X \u2032 ) = im (\u03b4X (T \u25e6 H)(\u03b1)) \u2286 im \u03b4X ,\nso \u03b1 factors through im \u03b4X . This means that the map\nA(X \u2032 , im \u03b4X ) \u2192 A(X \u2032 , X)\nis surjective. But it is also injective since the functor A(X \u2032 , \u2212) preserves\nmonomorphisms, and the conclusion follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.9. If A is a balanced category with epimorphic images, then\nthe morphism im \u03b4X \u2192 X is an H-equivalence and CH \u2286 GH .\nProof. The second statement of the conclusion follows from the first one by\nusing Proposition 2.8 and Lemma 2.2. But H carries the monomorphism\nim \u03b4X \u2192 X into a monomorphism in B, because H is a right adjoint. Moreover, since H(\u03b4X ) is right invertible, the same is true for the morphism\nH(im \u03b4X ) \u2192 H(X), as we may see from the commutative diagram\n(H \u25e6 T \u25e6 H)(X)\n\nH(\u03b4X )\n\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP\n((\n\n// H(X)\n99\ns\ns\nss\n.\ns\ns\ns\nsss\n\nH(im \u03b4X )\n\u0003\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n7\n\nProposition 2.10. Suppose both A and B are balanced categories with epimorphic images. The following are equivalent:\n(i) The pair of adjoint functors T \u22a3 H induces mutually inverse equivalences CH \u21c4 G T .\n(ii) \u03b7Y : Y \u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) is an epimorphism for all Y \u2208 B.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii). Denote Y \u2032 = im \u03b7Y . Then the unit \u03b7Y of adjunction factors\nas Y \u2192 Y \u2032 \u2192 (H \u25e6T )(Y ), where the epimorphism Y \u2192 Y \u2032 is a T -equivalence\nby the dual of Corollary 2.9, and Y \u2032 \u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) a monomorphism. Since\n(H \u25e6 T )(Y ) \u2208 Im H \u2286 G T and G T is closed under subobjects, we deduce\nY \u2032 \u2208 G T . Now (i) implies that \u03b7Y \u2032 is an isomorphism, so the diagram\n// Y \u2032\n\nY\n\n\u03b7Y \u2032\n\n\u03b7Y\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n(H \u25e6 T )(Y )\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n// (H \u25e6 T )(Y \u2032 )\n\nproves (ii).\n(ii)\u21d2(i). Condition (ii) implies that T (\u03b7Y ) is an epimorphism, for every\nY \u2208 B, since T preserves epimorphisms. But it is also left invertible by\ndiagrams 1. Thus it is invertible, with the inverse \u03b4T (Y ) . We have just shown\nthat SH = Im T , hence Theorem 2.5 tells us that CH and C T are equivalent\nvia H and T . Finally, since B is balanced, clearly G T = S T = C T .\n\u0003\nCombining Proposition 2.10 and its dual we obtain:\nTheorem 2.11. Suppose both A and B are balanced categories with epimorphic images. The following are equivalent:\n(i) The pair of adjoint functors T \u22a3 H induces mutually inverse equivalences GH \u21c4 G T .\n(ii) \u03b4X : (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u2192 X is a monomorphism for all X \u2208 A and\n\u03b7Y : Y \u2192 (H \u25e6 T )(Y ) is an epimorphism for all Y \u2208 B.\nRemark that [3, Proposition 2.2.4 and Theorem 2.3.8] provide characterizations of (weak) \u2217-modules which are analogous to Proposition 2.10 and\nTheorem 2.11 above. These results will be used in Section 5, for defining\nthe corresponding notions in a non additive situation.\n3. Representable equivalences\nOverall in this section A is a cocomplete category and E is small category.\nDenote by [E op , Set] the category of all contravariant functors from E into\nSet. Then we view E as a subcategory of [E op , Set], via the Yoneda embedding E \u2192 [E op , Set], e 7\u2192 E(\u2212, e). For simplicity, we shall write [Y \u2032 , Y ] for\n[E op , Set](Y \u2032 , Y ), where Y \u2032 , Y \u2208 [E op , Set]. For every Y \u2208 [E op , Set] denote\nby E \u2193 Y the comma category whose objects are of the form (e, y) with e \u2208 E\nand y \u2208 Y (e) and whose morphisms are\n(E \u2193 Y )((e\u2032 , y \u2032 ), (e, y)) = {\u03b1 \u2208 E(e\u2032 , e) | Y (\u03b1)(y \u2032 ) = y}.\n\n\f8\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nThe projection functor E \u2193 Y \u2192 E is given by (e, y) 7\u2192 e and \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03b1 for all\n(e, y) \u2208 E \u2193 Y and all \u03b1 \u2208 (E \u2193 Y )((e\u2032 , y \u2032 ), (e, y)). Observe then that the\nsubcategory E is dense in [E op , Set], what means, for every Y \u2208 [E op , Set] it\nholds\n\u223c colim((E \u2193 Y ) \u2192 E \u2192 [E op , Set]) = colim E(\u2212, e),\nY =\n(e,y)\u2208E\u2193Y\n\nwhere the last notation is a shorthand for the previous colimit.\nFor a functor A : E \u2192 A, consider the left Kan extension of A along the\nYoneda embedding:\nTA : [E op , Set] \u2192 A, TA (Y ) = colim A(e),\n(e,y)\u2208E\u2193Y\n\nwhich may be characterized as the unique, up to a natural isomorphism,\ncolimit preserving functor [E op , Set] \u2192 A, mapping E(\u2212, e) into A(e) for all\ne \u2208 E. The functor TA has a right adjoint, namely the functor\nHA : A \u2192 [E op , Set], HA (X) = A(A(\u2212), X).\nIn order to use the results of Section 1, we remaind the notations made\nthere, namely let \u03b4 : TA \u25e6 HA \u2192 1A and \u03b7 : 1B \u2192 HA \u25e6 TA be the arrows\nof adjunction. For simplicity we shall replace in the next considerations the\nsubscript HA and the superscript TA with A. So objects in CA , C A , GA and\nG A will be called A-colocal, A-local, A-generated, respectively A-cogenerated.\nWe consider overall in this section two subcategories C \u2286 A and C \u2032 \u2286\nop\n[E , Set], such that C is closed under taking colimits and retracts and C \u2032 is\nclosed under taking limits and retracts.\nLemma 3.1. Let H : C \u21c4 C \u2032 : T be a pair of adjoint functors T \u22a3 H, and\ndenote A : E \u2192 A the functor given by A(e) = T (E(\u2212, e)). If E(\u2212, e) \u2208 C \u2032\nfor all e \u2208 E then H is naturally isomorphic to the restriction of HA and T\nis naturally isomorphic to the restriction of TA , Im HA \u2286 C \u2032 and Im TA \u2286 C.\nIf moreover T is fully faithful, then arrow \u03b4X : (TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u2192 X is an\nHA -equivalence for all X \u2208 A.\nProof. Using Yoneda lemma, we have the natural isomorphisms for every\nX \u2208 C, and every e \u2208 E:\nH(X)(e) \u223c\n= [E(\u2212, e), H(X)] \u223c\n= A(T (E(\u2212, e)), X) = A(A(e), X) = HA (X)(e),\nthus H(X) \u223c\n= HA (X) naturally. Since A(e) = T (E(\u2212, e)) \u2208 C for all e \u2208 E,\nthe closure of C under colimits and the formula\nTA (Y ) = colim A(e),\n(e,y)\u2208E\u2193Y\n\nvalid for all Y \u2208 [E op , Set], show that Im TA \u2286 C. Therefore the assignment\nY 7\u2192 TA (Y ) defines a functor C \u2032 \u2192 C, which is naturally isomorphic to T ,\nas right adjoints of H.\nFurther Im TA \u2286 C implies Im HA \u2286 C \u2032 , since for all X \u2208 A, we have\n(HA \u25e6 TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u223c\n= H((TA \u25e6 HA )(X)) \u2208 C \u2032 ,\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n9\n\nHA (X) is a retract of (HA \u25e6 TA \u25e6 HA )(X) and C \u2032 is closed under retracts.\nNow, the fully faithfulness of T is equivalent to the fact that H \u25e6 T \u223c\n= 1C \u2032\nnaturally, thus Im HA \u2208 C implies\n(HA \u25e6 TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u223c\n= HA (X),\n= (H \u25e6 T )(HA (X)) \u223c\nwhat means that \u03b4X is an HA -equivalence.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 3.2. Let H : C \u21c4 C \u2032 : T be mutually inverse equivalences of\ncategories, and denote A : E \u2192 A the functor given by A(e) = T (E(\u2212, e)). If\nE(\u2212, e) \u2208 C \u2032 for all e \u2208 E then H is naturally isomorphic to the restriction of\nHA , T is naturally isomorphic to the restriction of TA , C = CA and C \u2032 = C A .\nProof. The conclusions concerning H and T follow by Lemma 3.1. For the\nrest, we have for all X \u2208 C:\nX\u223c\n= (T \u25e6 H)(X) \u223c\n= (TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u2208 Im TA \u2286 CA\nas we have seen in Lemma 2.1. Thus C \u2286 CA , and dually C \u2032 \u2286 C A .\nThe functor A \u2192 C given by X 7\u2192 (TA \u25e6 HA )(X) is a right adjoint of the\ninclusion functor C \u2192 A. Indeed, for all X \u2032 \u2208 C and all X \u2208 A, we obtain\nX\u2032 \u223c\n= (T \u25e6 H)(X \u2032 ) \u223c\n= (TA \u25e6 HA )(X \u2032 ) and HA (X) \u223c\n= (HA \u25e6 TA \u25e6 HA )(X) since\nthe counit \u03b4X of adjunction is an HA -equivalence, as we observed in Lemma\n3.1. Now the natural isomorphisms\n\u223c A((TA \u25e6 HA )(X \u2032 ), (TA \u25e6 HA )(X))\nA(X \u2032 , (TA \u25e6 HA )(X)) =\n\u223c\n= [HA (X \u2032 ), (HA \u25e6 TA \u25e6 HA )(X)] \u223c\n= [HA (X \u2032 ), HA (X)]\n\u223c\n= A((TA \u25e6 HA )(X \u2032 ), X) \u223c\n= A(X \u2032 , X)\nprove our claim. Using again the fact that \u03b4X : (TA \u25e6HA )(X) \u2192 X is an HA equivalence, Lemma 2.2 tells us that CA \u2286 C. The functor [E op , Set] \u2192 C \u2032\ngiven by Y 7\u2192 (HA \u25e6 TA )(Y ) is also well defined. In a dual manner we\nshow that it is a left adjoint of the inclusion C \u2032 \u2192 [E op , Set], and follows\nC A \u2286 C \u2032.\n\u0003\nThe equivalences H : C \u21c4 C \u2032 : T are called represented by A : E \u2192 A\nprovided that H \u223c\n= HA and T \u223c\n= TA as in the Theorem 3.2.\nIn the work [7] of Menini and Orsatti (see also [3]), it is given an additive\nversion of Theorem 3.2. There, our category E is preadditive with a single\nobject (that means it is a ring), A is an object in A with endomorphism ring\nE (therefore A : E \u2192 A is a fully faithful functor), and [E op , Set] is replaced\nwith Mod(E).\n4. The existence of cellular covers\nIn this Section consider as in the previous one a cocomplete category A,\na functor A : E \u2192 A, where E is a small category and construct its left Kan\nextension TA : [E op , Set] \u2192 A along the Yoneda embedding E \u2192 [E op , Set]\nwhich has the right adjoint HA : A \u2192 [E op , Set]. In addition suppose that\nA is fully faithful. Note that, this additional assumption means that the\n\n\f10\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\ncategory E may be identified with a (small) subcategory of A and A with\nthe inclusion functor. For example, if E has a single object, then A may be\nidentified with an object of A.\nLemma 4.1. If A is a cocomplete, balanced category with epimorphic images\nand A : E \u2192 A is fully faithful, then it holds:\na) A(e) \u2208 SA for all e \u2208 E.\nb) An object X \u2208 A is A-generated exactly if there is an epimorphism\nA\u2032 \u2192 X with A\u2032 a coproduct of objects of the form A(e) with e \u2208 E.\nProof. a) Since A is fully faithful, we have the natural isomorphisms:\n(TA \u25e6 HA )(A(e)) = TA (A(A(\u2212), A(e)) \u223c\n= TA (E(\u2212, e)) \u223c\n= A(e),\nfor every e \u2208 E.`\nb) Let A\u2032 = A(ei ) \u2208 A be a coproduct of objects of the form A(e). By\nthe result in a) we deduce\na\na\na\n(TA \u25e6 HA )(A(ei )) \u223c\nA\u2032 =\nA(ei ) \u223c\n= TA ( HA (A(ei ))) \u2208 Im TA ,\n=\n\nso A\u2032 \u2208 GA , since Im TA \u2286 GA , inclusion established in Lemma 2.7. If X \u2208 A\nsuch that there is an epimorphism A\u2032 \u2192 X, then X \u2208 GA , again by Lemma\n2.7. Conversely, for every X \u2208 A, the object HA (X) of [E op , Set] may be\nwritten as\nHA (X) \u223c\ncolim\nE(\u2212, e) = colim E(\u2212, e),\n=\n(e,x)\u2208E\u2193HA (X)\n\n(e,x)\u2208A\u2193X\n\nwhere the comma category A \u2193 X has as objects pairs of the form (e, x)\nwith e \u2208 E and x \u2208 A(A(e), X). Thus\n(TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u223c\n= colim TA (E(\u2212, e)) \u223c\n= colim A(e),\n(e,x)\u2208A\u2193X\n\n(e,x)\u2208A\u2193X\n\n`\n\nso there is an epimorphism from (e,x)\u2208A\u2193X A(e) to (TA \u25e6 HA )(X). Further\nthe morphism \u03b4X : (TA \u25e6 HA )(X) \u2192 X is an epimorphism too, for X \u2208 GA .\nComposing them we obtain the desired epimorphism.\n\u0003\nRecall that a category A is called well (co)powered if for every object the\nclass of subobjects (respectively quotient objects) is actually a set.\nTheorem 4.2. If A is a cocomplete, well copowered, balanced category with\nepimorphic images, and A : E \u2192 A is a fully faithful functor, then the\ninclusion functor CA \u2192 A has a right adjoint, or equivalently, every object\nin A has a left CA -approximation.\nProof. Combining Lemma 4.1 and Corollary 2.9, we deduce that every object\nin C is a quotient object of a direct sum of objects of the form A(e), so\n{A(e) | e \u2208 E} \u2286 CA is a generating set for CA , by [8, Chapter II, Proposition\n15.2]. The closure of CA under colimits implies that the inclusion functor\nCA \u2192 A preserves colimits, and the category CA inherits from A the property\nto be well copowered. Thus the conclusion follows by Freyd's Special Adjoint\nFunctor Theorem (see [8, Chapter V, Corollary 3.2]).\n\u0003\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n11\n\nIf E has a single object and A ia a fully faithful functor (i.e. A is an\nobject of A), then A-colocal objects are sometimes called A-cellular, and an\nHA -equivalence is called then simply an A-equivalence. Our Theorem 4.2\nshows that, under reasonable hypotheses (that means A is a cocomplete,\nwell copowered, balanced category with epimorphic images), every object\nX has an A-cellular approximation, what means an A-equivalence C \u2192 X\nwith C being A-cellular. Hence it is generalized in this way [4, Section 2.C],\nwhere is constructed an A-cellular approximation for every group.\nThe same proof that given [4, Lemma 2.6] for the case of the category of\ngroups works for the following consequence of the existence of an A-cellular\napproximation for every object X \u2208 A:\nCorollary 4.3. Let A : E \u2192 A be a fully faithful functor, where A is a\ncocomplete, well copowered, balanced category with epimorphic images and\nE is small category. The following are equivalent for a morphism \u03b1 : C \u2192 X\nin A\u2192 :\n(i) \u03b1 is a left CA -approximation of X.\n(ii) \u03b1 is an HA -equivalence and it is initial among all HA -equivalences\nending in X\n(iii) C \u2208 CA and \u03b1 is terminal among all morphisms from an A-colocal\nobject to X.\nConsequently we may use the following more of less tautological formulas\nfor determining the left CA -approximation of an object (see [5, Sections 7.1\nand 7.2]):\nCorollary 4.4. Let A : E \u2192 A be a fully faithful functor, where A is a\ncocomplete, well copowered, balanced category with epimorphic images and\nE is small category. If \u03b1 : C \u2192 X is the left CA -approximation X, then it\nholds:\na) C = lim\nX \u2032 , where X \u2032 \u2192 X runs over all HA -equivalences.\n\u2032\nX \u2192X\n\nb) C = colim\nX \u2032 , where X \u2032 runs over all A-colocal objects.\n\u2032\nX \u2192X\n\n5. \u2217-acts over monoids\nWe see a monoid M as a category with one object whose endomorphism\nset is M . Thus we consider the category [M op , Set] of all contravariant\nfunctors from this category to the category of sets, and we call it the category\nof (right) acts over M , or simply M -acts. Clearly an M -act is a set X\ntogether with a an action X \u00d7 M \u2192 X, (x, m) 7\u2192 xm such that (xm)m\u2032 =\nx(mm\u2032 ) and x1 = x for all x \u2208 X and all m, m\u2032 \u2208 M . Left acts are covariant\nfunctors M \u2192 Set, that is sets X together with an action M \u00d7 X \u2192 X,\nsatisfying the corresponding axioms. For the general theory of acts over\nmonoids and undefined notions concerning this subject we refer to [6]. We\nshould mention here that in contrast with [6] we allow the empty act to\nbe an object in our category of acts, for the sake of (co)completness. Note\n\n\f12\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nthat the category of M -acts is balanced and has epimorphic images, by [6,\nProposition 1.6.15 and Theorem 1.4.21].\nFix a monoid M and an object A \u2208 [M op , Set]. In order to use the\nresults of the preceding Sections, we identify A with a fully faithful functor\nE \u2192 [M op , Set] where E is the endomorphism monoid of A. Thus A is\ncanonically a E \u2212 M -biact (see [6, Definition 1.4.24]), so we obtain two\nfunctors\nHA : [M op , Set] \u2192 [E op , Set], HA (X) = [A, X]\nand\nTA : [E op , Set] \u2192 [M op , Set], TA (Y ) = Y \u2297E A\nthe second one being the left adjoint of the first (see [6, Definition 2.5.1 and\nProposition 2.5.19]). Clearly these functors agree with the functors defined\nat the beginning of the Section 3.\nWe say that A is a (weak) \u2217-act if the above adjoint pair induces mutually\ninverse equivalences HA : GA \u21c4 G A : TA (respective HA : CA \u21c4 G A : TA ).\nNote that our definitions for subcategories GA and G A agree with the characterizations of all A-generated respectively A\u2217 -cogenerated modules given\nin [2, Lemma 2.1.2]. As we may see from Proposition 2.10, our subcategory CA seems to be the non\u2013additive counterpart of the subcategory of all\nA-presented modules (compare with [2, Proposition 2.2.4]).\nIn what follows, we need more definitions relative to an M -act A. First\nA is called decomposable if there exists two non empty subacts B, C \u2286 A\nsuch that A = B \u222a C and B \u2229 C = \u2205 (see [6, Definition 1.5.7]). In this\ncase A = B \u2294 C, since coproducts in the category of acts is the disjoint\nunion, by [6, Proposition 2.1.8]. If A is not decomposable, then it is called\nindecomposable. Second, A is say to be weak self\u2013projective provided that\n(HA \u25e6 TA )(g) is an epimorphism whenever g : U \u2192 Y is an epimorphism in\n[E op , Set] with U \u2208 S A . More explicitly, if g : U \u2192 Y is an epimorphism\nin [E op , Set], then TA (g) is an epimorphism in [M op , Set] and our definition\nrequires that A is projective relative to such epimorphisms for which U \u2208\nS A . Third A is called (self\u2013)small provided that the functor HA preserves\ncoproducts (of copies of A).\nLemma 5.1. With the notations above, the following are equivalent:\n(i) A is small.\n(ii) A is self\u2013small.\n(iii) E (I) is \u03b7-reflexive for any set I, where E (I) denotes the coproduct\nindexed over I of copies of E.\n(iv) E \u2294 E is \u03b7-reflexive.\n(v) A is indecomposable.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii) is obvious.\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n13\n\n(ii)\u21d2(iii).

If A is decomposable, that is A = B \u2294 C with B 6= \u2205 and\nC 6= \u2205, then let iB : B \u2192 A and iC : C \u2192 A the canonical injections\nof this coproduct. Denote also by j1 , j2 : A \u2192 A \u2294 A the corresponding\ncanonical injections. The homomorphisms of M -acts j1 iB : B \u2192 A \u2294 A and\nj2 iC : C \u2192 A \u2294 A induce a unique homomorphism f : A = B \u2294 C \u2192 A \u2294 A.\nObviously f \u2208 (HA \u25e6 TA )(E \u2294 E) but f \u2208\n/ [A, A] \u2294 [A, A] = E \u2294 E.\n(iv)\u21d2(i) is [6, Lemma 1.5.37].\n\u0003\nProposition 5.2. The following statements hold:\na) If A is a weak \u2217-act then A is weak self\u2013projective.\nb) If A is weak self\u2013projective and indecomposable, then A is a weak\n\u2217-act.\nProof. a) Let A be a weak \u2217-act and let g : U \u2192 Y be an epimorphism\nin [E op , Set] with U \u2208 S A . We know by Proposition 2.10 that \u03b7Y is epic,\nand by the naturalness of \u03b7 that (HA \u25e6 TA )(g)\u03b7U = \u03b7Y g. Since \u03b7U is an\nisomorphism and \u03b7Y g is an epimorphism we deduce that (HA \u25e6 TA )(g) is an\nepimorphism too.\nb) As we have already noticed HA preserves coproducts, provided that\nA is indecomposable. Thus S A is closed under arbitrary coproducts in the\ncategory of E-acts. For a fixed Y \u2208 [E op , Set] there is an epimorphism\ng : E (I) \u2192 Y . How E is \u03b7-reflexive the same is also true for E (I) . But\n(HA \u25e6 TA )(g) is an epimorphism, since A is weak self\u2013projective. From the\nequality (HA \u25e6 TA )(g)\u03b7E (I) = \u03b7Y g follows that \u03b7Y is an epimorphism too.\nThe conclusion follows by Proposition 2.10.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.3. The following statements hold:\na) If A is a \u2217-act then A is weak self\u2013projective and CA = GA .\nb) If A is indecomposable, weak self\u2013projective and CA = GA , then A is\na \u2217-act.\nProof. The both implications follow at once from Proposition 5.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.4. Propositions 2.10 and 5.2 and Theorems 2.11 and 5.3 provide a\nnon additive version of [2, Proposition 2.2.4] respectively [2, Theorem2.3.8].\nIn contrast with the case of modules, where the functors are additive, for\nacts it is not clear that a weak star object must me indecomposable (the\nnon additive version of self\u2013smallness as we may seen from Lemma 5.1). The\n\n\f14\n\nGEORGE CIPRIAN MODOI\n\nmain obstacle for deducing this implication in the new setting comes from\nthe fact that non additive functors do not have to preserves finite coproducts.\nUsing the characterization of so called tilting modules given in [2, Theorem 2.4.5], we may define a tilting M -act to be a \u2217-act A such that the\ninjective envelope of M belongs to GA . Note that injective envelopes exist\nin [M op , Set] by [6, Corollary 3.1.23]. As a subject for a future research we\nmay ask ourselves which from the many beautiful results which are known\nfor tilting modules do have correspondents for acts.\nOur next aim is to infer from our results the Morita\u2013type characterization\nof an equivalence between categories of acts (see [6, Section 5.3]). In order\nto perform it we need a couple of lemmas.\nLemma 5.5. If the M -act A is a generator in [M op , Set] then CA = GA =\n[M op , Set].\nProof. For a generator A of [M op , Set] the equality GA = [M op , Set] follows\nby Lemma 4.1. Moreover M is a retract of A by [6, Theorem 2.3.16], therefore M \u2208 CA , since CA is closed under retracts. Thus a morphism \u01eb : U \u2192 V\nin [M op , Set] is an A-equivalence if and only if it is an isomorphism, therefore\nCA = [M op , Set].\n\u0003\nRecall that the left E-act A is said to be pull back flat if the functor\nTA = (\u2212 \u2297E A) commutes with pull backs (see [6, Definition 3.9.1]).\nLemma 5.6. If the right M -act A is indecomposable, weak self projective\nand the left E-act A is pull back flat, then G A = [E op , Set].\nProof. First observe that A is a weak \u2217-act by Proposition 5.2. Hence G A =\nC A = S A , and this subcategory has to be closed under subacts and limits.\nMoreover E (I) is \u03b7-reflexive for any set I according to Lemma 5.1. For a\nfixed Y \u2208 [E op , Set] there is an epimorphism g : E (I) \u2192 Y . Take the kernel\npair of g, that is construct the pull back\nK\n\nk1\n\n//\n\nE (I)\ng\n\nk2\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nE (I)\n\n.\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\ng\n\n// Y\n\nThe functors TA and HA preserve pull backs, the first one by hypothesis\nand the second one automatically. Moreover K is a subact of E (I) \u00d7 E (I)\nand the closure properties of S A imply K \u223c\n= (TA \u25e6 HA )(K). Applying the\nfunctor HA \u25e6 TA to the above diagram and having in the mind the previous\n\n\fLOCALIZATIONS, COLOCALIZATIONS AND NON ADDITIVE \u2217-OBJECTS\n\n15\n\nobservations we obtain a pull back diagram\nk1\n\nK\n\n// E (I) = (HA \u25e6 TA ) E (I)\n(HA \u25e6TA )(g)\n\nk2\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nE (I) = (HA \u25e6 TA ) E\n\n\u0001\n(I)\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n(HA \u25e6TA )(g)\n\n// (HA \u25e6 TA )(Y )\n\nNote that (HA \u25e6 TA )(g) is an epimorphism by hypothesis. Then we know by\n[6, Theorem 2.2.44] that both g and (HA \u25e6 TA )(g) are coequalizers for the\npair (k1 , k2 ). Thus we deduce Y \u223c\n= (HA \u25e6 TA )(Y ) canonically, so Y \u2208 S A .\nA\nA\nop\nThus G = S = [E , Set].\n\u0003\nNow we are in position to prove the desired Morita\u2013type result:\nTheorem 5.7. Let M and E be two monoids. Then the categories [M op Set]\nand [E op , Set] are equivalent via the mutually inverse equivalence functors\nH and T if and only if there is a cyclic, projective generator A of [M op , Set]\nsuch that E is the endomorphism monoid of A, case in which H = HA and\nT = TA .\nProof. First note that a projective act is indecomposable if and only if it is\ncyclic in virtue of [6, Propositions 1.5.8 and 3.17.7].\nIf H : [M op , Set] \u21c4 [E op , Set] : T are mutually inverse equivalences,\nthen H \u223c\n= HA and T \u223c\n= TA , where A = T (E) according to Theorem 3.2.\nMoreover the endomorphism monoid of A is E, and A has to be projective,\nindecomposable and generator together with E.\nConversely if A is indecomposable and projective in [M op , Set] then it\nis a weak \u2217-act by Proposition 5.2. Since A is in addition a generator,\nLemma 5.5 tell us that A is a \u2217-act and CA = GA = [M op , Set] and Theorem\n5.3 implies that A is a \u2217-act. Finally the left E-act A is projective by [6,\nCorollary 3.18.17], so it is strongly flat by [6, Proposition 3.15.5], that means\nTA commutes both with pull backs and equalizers. Thus G A = [E op , Set],\naccording to Lemma 5.6.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] F. Casta\u00f1o Iglesias, J. G\u00f3mez\u2013Torrecillas, R.
