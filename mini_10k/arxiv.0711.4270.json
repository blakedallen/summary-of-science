The\nelementary excitations of the system consist of polaritons, i.e. a superposition of a cavity photon and an exciton which at low excitation levels satisfy Bose statistics.\nTheir photonic component guarantees that a large degree\nof spatial coherence is maintained in spite of disorder effects, while the excitonic one provides strong mutual interactions. Differently from most other examples of Bose\ngases such as liquid 4 He and ultracold atoms, a polariton gas is an intrinsecally non-equilibrium system, whose\nproperties can dramatically differ from the corresponding\nones of systems at thermodynamical equilibrium5,6,7,8 .\nRecent advances in the semiconductor fabrication technology, have made it now possible to design polariton\ntraps with a high flexibility in the shape and the depth\nof the trapping potential9,10,11,12,13,14,15 . From this perspective, double-well potentials show a particular interest as they provide a way of investigating the wellknown Josephson effect16,17,18 in completely new nonequilibrium regimes. Some preliminary work for the case\nof non-resonantly pumped polariton condensates has recently appeared in8 , while many authors have considered similar effects in a variety of different optical systems19,20,21 .\nIn the present paper, we will concentrate on the case of\nresonantly and coherently pumped double-well polariton\ntraps obtained by lateral patterning of a planar microcavity as experimentally done in12,13 : such a configuration\nallows not only for selective addressing and diagnostics\nof the two spatial modes, but also for a relatively easy\ntime-resolution of the Josephson dynamics on a picosecond scale. The mean-field calculations of the present paper will be a crucial preliminary step in view of truly\nquantum effects22 that are expected to take place in such\nminiaturized systems whenever the Josephson charging\n\nenergy for a single polariton becomes comparable to both\nthe linewidths and the hopping energy. This regime is expected to be entered in the next generation of samples.\nIn Sec. II, we introduce the effective two mode model\nand we write the motion equations describing the time\ndynamics of the polariton field amplitudes in each of the\ntwo wells. The phase diagram and the different instability regimes are analyzed in Sec. III for the case of a\ncontinuous-wave pumping. The result of a numerical integration of the dynamical equations of the two-mode\nmodel is presented in Sec. IV for the case of a quasicontinuous wave pump and in Sec. V for the case of a\npulsed pump: optical bistability and self-pulsing phenomena take place in the former case, Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in the latter one. In Sec. VI, the\npredictions of the two-mode model are compared to full\nnumerical simulations of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. The observability of all the predicted features\nis verified using realistic parameters for coupled polariton\nboxes. Conclusions are finally drawn in Sec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nTHE TWO-MODE MODEL\n\nA widespread description of the Josephson dynamics\nin two-well system is based on an effective two-mode\nmodel17 . In addition to the linear coupling J and the\ncubic nonlinearity g, a coherent pumping F1,2 (t) and\nloss rates \u03b31,2 are to be included in order to describe\nthe driven-dissipative nature of the present system.

Under a pump acting only on one unperturbed\nmode that is F1 (t) = F (t), F2 = 0 both the eigenmodes\nare excited. In what follows, we will concentrate our attention on this last case.\nThis simple linear analysis is made richer by the presence of nonlinear terms. Actually, a cubic nonlinearity\nhas two main, and strictly related effects: it introduces\nintensity-dependent shifts of the effective energy levels\nand can be responsible for dynamical instabilities. Because of the nonlinearity, the effective eigenmodes of the\nsystem are no longer the symmetric and the antisymmetric ones. Therefore, to refer to the actual eigenmodes of\nthe system, we prefer to adopt the notation \"+\" and \"-\"\nmode.\nA.\n\nThe stationary state\n\nIn the whole paper, we shall restrict our attention to\nthe case of a pump acting on a single mode, i.e. Fj (t) =\n\u03b4j1 F (t): this scheme is in fact the most interesting for\napplications and is amenable to an almost fully analytical\ntreatment.\nWe start by considering the steady state of the system under a continuous monochromatic pump, F1 (t) =\ne\u2212i\u03c9t F s , where the amplitudes of the two modes oscillate\nat the pump frequency\n\u03c8j (t) = e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c8js .\n\n(4)\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into Eqs. (1-2), the following stationarity equations are immediately obtained:\n\u0010\n\u03b3j \u0011 s\ns\nh\u0304\u03c9j \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 i\n\u03c8j +gnj \u03c8js \u2212J\u03c83\u2212j\n+\u03b4j1 F s = 0 , (5)\n2\n\nwhere nj \u2261 |\u03c8js |2 defines the stationary intensity in the\ntwo modes. From Eqs. (5), it is straightforward to show\nthat the mode amplitude \u03c81s and the pump amplitude F s\nare uniquely determined for each given pair of values of\nthe pump energy h\u0304\u03c9 and of the stationary amplitude \u03c82s\nin the non-pumped mode 2. By rearranging Eqs.

These two situations will be discussed in detail in what follows.\n\nIII. CONTINUOUS EXCITATION: PHASE\nDIAGRAM AND FLUCTUATION SPECTRUM\n\nUnder continuous monochromatic pumping, a contour\nplot of the pump amplitude F s as a function of the pump\nenergy h\u0304\u03c9 and of the intensity n2 in the non-pumped\nmode is readily obtained from Eqs. (6-7). An example of\nsuch plot is shown in Fig. 1 for the symmetric \u03c91 = \u03c92\ncase.\nThe phase diagram is determined from the stability of\nthe stationary state (5). The black thick lines mark the\ncontours between the regions of stability and the regions\nof instability, as obtained by solving the linearized problem Eq. (12). Here, regions of one-mode instability or\nparametric instability are indicated by respectively 1M\nand P following the definitions introduced in Sec. II B.\nFor very small pump amplitudes, two resonances are\nclearly visible in Fig. 1. As explained in Sec. II, they\ncorresponds to the \u03c8\u00b1 eigenmodes of the linearly coupled\nsystem and lye at exactly h\u0304\u03c9 = \u00b1J. The linewidth has\nbeen taken smaller than the linear coupling \u03b3/2 < J, so\nthe corresponding lines are well distinct.\nFor increasing values of the pump amplitude, the resonances of the system are modified by the nonlinearity (see\nthe scheme in Fig. 2). At moderate pump amplitudes for\nwhich g n1,2 < J, \u03b3, the main effect of the nonlinearity is\na blue-shift of the two resonances.

An example of this behaviour is shown in Fig. 3 where the dependence of the\nintensities n1,2 on the pump amplitude is plotted for a\npump energy just above the lower resonance.\nAn hysteresis cycle is apparent: as the pump amplitude F increases from zero, the system moves along the\nlower branch of stable solutions until its end point is\nreached. Only at this point the system jumps on the\nupper branch. If the pump amplitude is then decreased,\nthe system keeps moving along the upper branch of stable solution until its end point is reached, where it jumps\nback to the lower branch.\nC.\n\n1000\n500\n\n1M\n(d)\n\nE\n\n1500\nF\n\nn1\n\n(b)\n\nE\n\nn2\n\n(a)\n\nParametric instability\n\nFor a pump energy between the two resonances, a\nparametric instability appears.

In the dynamical systems language, such an instability is called a Hopf\nbifurcation24 .\nThe strong amplification of fluctuations around the\nstationary solution eventually results in a self-pulsing dynamics where the system keeps on oscillating for indefinite times. From a different point of view, these oscillations can be seen as the result of the interference between\nthree fields at different frequencies, i.e. the pump, signal, and idler fields of the parametric oscillator3,23 . This\nbehavior will be discussed in better detail in the next\nsection.\nD.\n\nHigh-energy region\n\nFor pump energy exceeding the energy of both resonances, several instability regions are expected to appear\nas a consequence of the complex interplay of single-mode\n1M and parametric P instabilities. Both effective energy\nlevels eventually cross the pump energy, as well as the\nparametric resonance [Fig. 2(d)]. The diagram in Fig. 1\nis therefore much richer in this window: for a given pump\nenergy h\u0304\u03c9 and increasing values of n2 , three regions of\none-mode instability and three regions of parametric instability can be identified, as well as a thin stability region in between the first 1M and P regions.\nTo understand the origin of the different regimes, the\nintensities n1,2 are plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of n2 for\nh\u0304\u03c9 = 1.5 meV.

Separation between\ninstability regions of different (1M or P) kinds are indicated\nby the vertical dotted lines. Same system parameters as in\nFig. 1.\n\nFor a pump energy lying between the two blue-shifted\nresonances, i.e. \u2212J + gn2 < h\u0304\u03c9 < J + gn2 , the intensity\nn2 of the non-pumped mode is larger than the intensity\nn1 of the pumped one, i.e. n2 > n1 . Conversely, for\neither lower (h\u0304\u03c9 < \u2212J + gn2 ) or larger (h\u0304\u03c9 > J + gn2 )\npump energies, the pumped mode has a larger intensity.\nThis trend is illustrated in the n1 /n2 plot shown in Fig. 5.\n1500\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE.\n\n500\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n2\nh\u03c9 (meV)\n\n3\n\n10\u22122\n\nFirst we investigate the region around the stability\ntongue extending at h\u0304\u03c9 >\n\u223c 1.5 meV for relatively small\nvalues of F . While the energy of the pumped 1 mode is\nsignificantly blue-shifted by the nonlinear term, the nonpumped 2 mode remains almost empty (see Fig. 4). The\ntwo 1, 2 modes are then far in energy, so the effect of\nthe linear coupling is strongly suppressed. The nearby\n1M instability region then corresponds to the bistability\nloop for a pump close to resonance with the higher energy mode, which in this region basically coincides with\nthe blue-shifted 1 mode. The physics is analogous for the\nsecond 1M instability region located just above.\nThe third 1M instability at much larger pump ampli-\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\nFIG. 5: Logarithmic gray-scale plot of the ratio n1 /n2 as\na function of the pump energy and of the value n2 .

These are plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of the\nintensity n2 of the non-pumped mode for the case of a\npump energy h\u0304\u03c9 chosen between the \u00b1 eigenmodes of the\nunloaded system.\n\n2\n\nn2\n\n1\n\n100\n\nn /n\n\n1000\n\ntudes corresponds to the opposite situation where the\n2 mode has been shifted above h\u0304\u03c9 and consequently\nn2 \u226b n1 according to (13). The bistability loop then\ninvolves the lower resonance, which in this regime basically corresponds to the unperturbed 1 mode.\nWe finally consider the intervals of parametric instability. The first and the third intervals correspond to\nresonant scattering processes taking place in a regime\nwhere the modes are effectively decoupled as n1 \u226b n2\nor n2 \u226b n1 , respectively. In these regimes, the two \u00b1\neigenmodes essentially coincide with the 1, 2 modes. The\nsecond interval corresponds instead to an intermediate\nregime where n1 \u2248 n2 , and the two \u00b1 eigenmodes are a\nsuperposition of both 1, 2 modes.\n\nRe{E\u03b1} (meV)\n\n2000\n\n0\n\nF\n\na\n\nF\n\nb\n\n200\n\nF\n\nF\n\nc\n\n400\n\nd\n\nn2\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 6: Real (a) and imaginary (b) part of the linearized\nspectrum around the steady state solution as a function of\nn2 .

CONTINUOUS PUMP: BISTABILITY,\nSELF-PULSING, AND RESPONSE TO A PROBE\n\nThe stationary states and the stability regions identified in the previous section are a good starting point\nfor the dynamical study of the system that we carry out\nin the present section by numerically solving Eqs. (12). We first investigate the onset of the steady state\nwhen the pump intensity is slowly increased in time to\nits asymptotic value. Then we characterize the response\nof the system in its steady state to an additional probe:\nthis provides a simple and effective way of measuring the\nfrequencies and damping rates of the Bogoliubov modes\nin the different regimes.\nThe quasi-continuous pump is assumed to have a\nsmooth temporal profile of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nF (t) = Fmax 1 \u2212\n.\n(14)\n1 + e(t/\u03c4 )2\n\n(a)\n22\n\n20\n\nn\n\nthem to pairwise intersect at some value of the intensity. Here, each pair collapses onto values Re{E2(4) } =\nRe{E1(3) } opposite in sign. Correspondingly, the damping rate increases \u2212Im{E1 } = \u2212Im{E4 } > \u03b3/2 for two\nof them, while it decreases \u2212Im{E2 } = \u2212Im{E3 } < \u03b3/2\nfor the two others, possibly giving rise to a dynamical instability, as in the case displayed in the figure. The fact\nthat frequencies of the modes involved in the instability\nare non-zero is a signature of the parametric nature of\nthe instability.\nFor larger intensities, the frequencies split again within\na narrow intensity interval where the damping rate goes\nback to \u03b3/2, but another instability region occurs at even\nhigher intensities as a consequence of the intersection\nRe{E1 } = Re{E4 }: while the the imaginary parts of the\n2, 3 modes stay unchanged, the ones of the 1, 4 modes\nare split and dynamical instability is signalled by one of\nthem becoming positive. Since the unstable mode has\nzero frequency, the instability has the one-mode character typical of optical bistability loops.\nFor even larger intensities, the stationary state becomes stable again: because of the large blue- (red-) shift\nof the positive (negative)-weighted Bogoliubov modes, no\nfurther intersections of the mode frequencies can in fact\noccur.\n\n923\n\n500\n920\n\n0\n0\n\n400\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n420\n\n440\n\n1000\n\nt (ps)\n\nFIG. 7: Time-evolution of the n1 (t) (dashed line) and n2 (t)\n(solid line) intensities for growing pump amplitudes Fmax =\n1 meV (a), 5 meV (b) 8 meV (c), 20 meV (d).

The corresponding spectra shown in Fig. 8 are obtained by Fourier transform of \u03c81,2 (t).

Parameters of the\n(a-d) panels correspond to the ones in Fig. 7.\n\nA.\n\nStable regime\n\nFor small values of the asymptotic pump amplitude\nFmax [Fig. 7(a) and (b)], the evolution during the switchon time smoothly leads the system to the asymptotic\nstationary state. As this solution is stable, the response\nto the probe pulse gets quickly damped within a timescale of the order of ten picosecond. While for very small\nintensities (Fig. 7(a)) the response consists of damped\noscillations at a single frequency, for larger intensities\n(Fig. 7(b)) relaxation is more complex and involves interference of more frequencies.\nThis difference is apparent in the corresponding spectra shown in Fig. 8(a,b) which are to be compared to\nthe Bogoliubov modes shown in Fig. 6. Well inside the\nstability region, only the positive-weighted Bogoliubov\nmodes with a significant U component [see Eq. (10)] are\nin fact visible. On the other hand, when the parametric\ninstability region is approached, the normal components\nU are significant for all modes and all the four frequen-\n\nB.\n\nParametric instability\n\nThe physics is richer in Figs. 7(c) and 8(c) where a\nlarger pump amplitude Fmax = 8 meV is considered: in\nthis case, the asymptotic stationary state is in fact parametrically unstable. As the pump intensity is increased\nvery smoothly, the system adiabatically follows the stationary state at the instantaneous value of F even in the\nunstable region. However, the arrival of the probe pulse\nspeeds up the onset of the instability: the perturbation\nthat it induces is quickly amplified until the system gets\nto the self-pulsing regime where undamped periodic oscillations take place for indefinite time. Their frequency is\nclose to the one of the linear Bogoliubov mode getting unstable. Correspondingly, two \u03b4-peaks appear in the spectrum shown Fig. 8(c) at energies E \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 = \u00b10.52 meV.\nThe weaker \u03b4-peaks at harmonic frequencies contribute\nto the quite complex waveform of the self-pulsing oscillations in time shown in Fig. 7(c).\n\nC.\n\nOne-mode instability\n\nTo highlight hysteresis phenomena, we now choose an\nasymptotic value of the pump amplitude above the jumpup threshold of the bistability loop shown in Fig. 3. The\nswitch-on then does not take place in a smooth way and\nthe system has to perform a sudden jump when the endpoint of the lower branch is reached: among the many\ncomplex behaviour that may take place28 , the behaviour\nof the present system is the simplest: it jumps to the\nhigher-intensity branch of the bistable loop. Once these\nupper branch is reached, the system is stable again and\nthe response to the probe pulse is qualitatively similar\nto the case of panels (a,b). The only difference is the\nhigher frequency of the oscillations, and the presence of\nthree different excitation frequencies which contribute to\nthe complex relaxation dynamics: one negative-weighted\nBogoliubov mode has in fact a significant U component.\n\nV. PULSED EXCITATION: JOSEPHSON\nOSCILLATIONS AND SELF-TRAPPING\n\nAfter having investigated the behaviour of the system\nunder a continuous pump, it is now interesting to look at\nthe case where only a pulsed pump is applied to the system.

Spectra are obtained by Fourier transforming the signals in the whole time interval. Same system parameters as\nin Fig. 1.\n\nFor low pump amplitudes in the linear regime, the\nintensities in the two wells manifest Josephson-like oscillations [Fig. 9(a)]. The pump pulse creates in fact a\nlocalized excitation in the 1 mode, which is a superposition of the symmetric and anti-symmetric eigenmodes\nof the system. Because of their energy splitting, the system shows complete Josephson oscillations with a period\n\u03c0h\u0304/J, which then damp out at a rate \u03b3 under the effect\nof losses. Correspondingly, the Fourier spectrum shown\nin Fig. 9(b) is characterized by a pair of resonance peaks\nsplit by 2J.\nFor stronger pump amplitudes, the instantaneous intensity in the system increases, and eventually results\nin significant nonlinear effects. While the time evolution of the intensities [Fig. 9(c)-(e)] does not appear to\nbe significantly modified, nonlinear effects are visible in\nthe spectra of Fig. 9(d)-(f) already at moderate intensities as a global blue-shift of the spectrum and a significant increase of the width of the peaks. In particular, in\nFig. 9(f), note how the blue-shift of the spectrum relative\n\nto the field \u03c81 is larger than the blue-shift of the spectrum\nrelative to \u03c82 : this is due to the fact that the intensity\nn1 is at short times much larger than the intensity n2 . In\nthe Fourier spectrum of \u03c81 , we also clearly recognize two\npeaks at J = \u00b10.5 meV corresponding to the eigenfrequencies of the linear dynamics that is recovered at long\ntimes once the intensities have dropped to small values.\nSimilar peaks also contribute to the Fourier spectrum of\n\u03c82 , but are hardly visible in the figure, their weak intensity being hidden by the tails of the main peaks.\nThe appearance of peaks at frequencies characteristic\nof the nonlinear regime is a precursor of the self-trapping\nregime that appears for stronger pump amplitudes: in\nthis case, the nonlinear effects are in fact dominant in\ndetermining both the spectrum and the time evolution\nof the intensities [Fig. 9(g)-(h)].\nIn the early stages of the evolution when the intensity\nis the largest, nonlinear effects dramatically suppress the\namplitude of Josephson oscillation: most of the intensity\nis in fact self-trapped in the mode 1 and the intensity of\nmode 2 oscillates around a much smaller value. As time\ngoes on, the total intensity slowly drops under the effect\nof losses and eventually complete Josephson oscillations\nare recovered: the transition between the self-trapping\nregime and Josephson oscillations can be located in the\nvicinity of the time when the total intensity equals the\ncritical density n1 + n2 = nctot = 4J/g of equilibrium\nJosephson systems17 . The presence of losses is only responsible for a small shift of the critical point.\nConsequences of this physics can be observed also in\nFig. 9(h): both spectra show in fact two broad peaks centered at high energies (i.e. at E \u2243 0 and E \u2243 1.5 meV),\nwhich represent the two resonances of the system in\nthe self-trapping regime, and two lower energy peaks at\nE = \u00b1J = \u00b10.5 meV, representing the frequencies of the\nJosephson oscillations. These two latter peaks are asymmetric [differently from the pure linear regime displayed\nin Fig. 9(b)] because the dynamics has been modified by\nthe occurrence of the self-trapping regime.\n\nVI.\n\nMICROCAVITY POLARITON BOXES\n\nIn this last section we show how the parameters of the\ntwo-mode model can be evaluated from the microscopic\nstructure of a specific physical system. On one hand we\ndemonstrate that all the physics discussed in the previous\nsections can actually be observed in realistic systems, on\nthe other hand we confirm the quantitative validity of the\npredictions of the two-mode model by comparing them\nto a full numerical integration of the generalized GrossPitaevskii equation for polaritons3,5 .\nAlthough many other configurations based on e.g. coupled DBR cavities are available to study Josephson-like\neffects in an optical context19,20,29,30 , our attention will\nbe concentrated on the specific case of double-well polariton traps.

(17)\nmp is the effective mass of the lower polariton, \u03b3 is the\ndecay rate, Uext is the trapping potential, v is the effective polariton mutual interaction31,32,33 and f (r, t) is the\namplitude of the coherent pump field.\nIn this paper, we consider the case of a trapping potential Uext (r) formed by two adjacent wells, as displayed in\nFig. 10(a):\nUext = \u2212U0 \u03b8 (Ly \u2212 |y|) [\u03b8 (Lx + \u03b4/2 \u2212 x) \u03b8 (x \u2212 \u03b4/2)\n+ \u03b8 (Lx + \u03b4/2 + x) \u03b8 (\u2212x \u2212 \u03b4/2)] . (18)\nFor this potential, the fundamental mode of energy Egs is\ndescribed by an eigenfunction \u03c6gs (r) which is symmetric\nin the two wells (see Fig. 10(b)), while the first excited\nmode of energy Eexc corresponds to an antisymmetric\neigenfunction \u03c6exc (r) (see Fig. 10(c)). Without loss of\ngenerality, both these functions can be taken real.\nThe pump field is considered to be monochromatic,\nwith a gaussian spatial profile\nf (r, t) = 2\u03c0 \u03c3 2 f0 e\u2212|r\u2212r1 |\n\n2\n\n/\u03c32\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n(19)\n\ncentered on the first well at r1 = ((Lx +\u03b4)/2, Ly /2)t . Provided the pump energy is close to Egs and Eexc and all\nother excited modes of the trapping potential are at much\nhigher energies, the coherent field \u03a8(r, t) can be safely\nwritten in the two-mode limit17 as a time-dependent superposition of the two lower energy modes \u03c6gs (r) and\n\u03c6exc (r) only.\nFor the present case, it is useful to write the superposition in the form\n\u03a8 (r, t) = \u03c81 (t) \u03c61 (r) + \u03c82 (t) \u03c62 (r) ,\n\n(20)\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n(21)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nx (\u03bcm)\n\nFIG. 10: Trapping potential Uext (Eq.

(17)\ncan be performed and then quantitatively compared to\nthe predictions of the two-mode model.\nFor this comparison, realistic parameters for typical\npolariton boxes in GaAs based microcavities12,13 are\nused, that is a trapping potential depth U0 = 5 meV,\nlateral box sizes Lx = 1 \u03bcm and Ly = 2 \u03bcm, a polariton\nmass mp = 7 \u00d7 10\u22125m0 (m0 being the electron mass) and\na nonlinear coupling constant v = 2\u00d710\u22123 meV\u03bcm2 . We\nassume the separation \u03b4 = 0.5 \u03bcm between the two wells.\nThe corresponding potential Uext and the functions relative to the first two GP modes are displayed in Fig. 10.\nA spatial width \u03c3 = 0.5 \u03bcm is taken for the pump spot.\nThe time-evolution of the polariton occupation\nn1,2 (t) = |\u03c81,2 (t)|2 in the two wells is plotted in Fig. 11.\nIn the present GPE framework, the occupations n1,2 of\neach of the two wells are defined by the spatial integrals\nZ +\u221e Z\nn1 (t) =\ndx dy |\u03a8(r, t)|2\n(29)\n0\n\nn2 (t) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndx\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\ndy |\u03a8(r, t)|2 .\n\n(30)\n\nTwo different parameter choices are made in the two panels of Fig. 11. In (a), the system tends to a stable stationary state, while self-pulsing oscillations are visible in (b).\nThe qualitative agreement with respectively panels (a,b)\nand (c) of Fig. 7 is apparent. Note that the switch-on\ntime of the pump considered in Fig. 11 is not long enough\nto guarantee a quasi-static evolution of the system even\nin the unstable region: differently from Fig. 7(c), the selfpulsing oscillations are immediately visible without the\nneed of a perturbation seed.\nAs the linear coupling J is very sensitive to the shape\nof the wavefunctions in the barrier, interactions may affect it quite significantly, spoiling the quantitative agreement with the two-mode model. In order to get a good\nquantitative agreement in all regimes, a better approximation can be adopted for the localized wavefunctions using for \u03c6gs (r) and \u03c6exc (r) the two lowest-energy solutions\n\n200\n\n300\n\n0\n0\n\nB.\n\n200\n0\n\nn1,2\n\nFor typical geometries and for moderate intensities, the\ncoefficients b and c are much smaller than the other quantities and can be safely neglected.

As expected, the main effect of interactions\nis to slightly lift the bottom of the two wells, so to effectively reduce the barrier height and enhance tunneling.\nThe result of such a procedure is also shown in Fig. 11:\nthe overall qualitative agreement is good. From a quantitative point of view, the agreement is always excellent in\nthe stable regime of panel (a), while some discrepancies\nare visible in panel (b), in particular at short times before the self-pulsing sets in. This can be expected, as the\n\n\f11\nparameters of the two-mode model extracted from the\nlate time dynamics slightly differ from what one would\nget from the early stages. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the wavefunction has a significant variation in time\nduring the self-pulsing dynamics.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have studied the two-mode dynamics\nof spatially coupled polariton boxes under a coherent external pumping and we have shown that this provides an\ninteresting non-equilibrium optical generalization of the\nwell-known Josephson effect of weakly coupled superfluids and superconductors.\nFor a continuous wave pumping, a phase diagram has\nbeen obtained which summarizes the steady state of the\nsystem as a function of pump intensity and frequency.\nStable and unstable regions have been identified; one-\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\ndavide.sarchi@epfl.ch\nSpecial issue on Microcavities, edited by J.
