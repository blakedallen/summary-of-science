Introduction\nThe new broad-band correlators for compact interferometric arrays and multi-beam receivers are beginning\nto enable large area surveys at high radio frequencies\n(\u2265 15 GHz), hitherto impossible because the beam solid\nangle scales as \u03bd \u22122 (assuming diffraction limited performance) so that surveying large areas of the sky becomes\nquickly impractical at high frequencies with conventional\ntechniques. The high-frequency surveys will have a major\nimpact on astrophysics:\n\u2013 They will open a window on new classes of both Galactic\nand extragalactic sources, for example on those with\nstrong synchrotron or free-free self-absorption corresponding to both very early phases of nuclear radioactivity (extreme GHz Peaked Spectrum - GPS sources or high-frequency peakers) and late phases\nof the evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),\ncharacterized by low accretion/radiative efficiency\nSend offprint requests to: G. De Zotti: dezotti@pd.astro.it\n\n(ADAF/ADIOS sources), as well as to early phases of\nthe evolution of radio afterglows of gamma-ray bursts.\n\u2013 They will provide adequate samples to get a really unbiased view of rare, but very interesting, classes of\nsources with flat spectrum up to high frequencies,\nthat, at low frequencies, are swamped by more numerous populations which fade away as the frequency\nincreases. One example are blazars, for which much\nmore extended samples are required to properly cover\ntheir parameter space. Galactic sources with substantial high-frequency emission include star-forming regions, transient black hole binaries and flaring brown\ndwarves.\n\u2013 They will allow us to get important information even\non the physics of sources known from lower frequency\nsurveys: the high frequency spectral steepenings due\nto electron aging are informative on the distribution of\nsource ages and on mechanisms for energy losses; the\nbreak frequencies marking the transition from optically\nthick to optically thin regimes depend on the magnetic\nfield intensity, etc..\n\n\f2\n\nGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\n\u2013 They will produce surveys of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect in distant clusters of galaxies and perhaps on\ngalactic scales, extremely important both to understand the formation of large scale structure and the\nheating of the intergalactic medium.\n\u2013 They will play a vital role in the interpretation of\ntemperature and polarization maps of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), by allowing us to characterize and remove the contamination by astrophysical foregrounds\n\u2013 They will be essential to calibrate the forthcoming large\nmillimeter array ALMA.\n\u2013 Follow-up high frequency observations will allow us to\nstudy the intrinsic polarization of sources, unaffected\nby Faraday depolarization, as well as their variability properties, essential ingredients to understand their\nphysics.\nNASA's WMAP satellite, designed to make accurate\nmeasurements of the space distribution of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), is carrying out the first\nall sky millimeter surveys in five bands (centered at 22.8,\n33.0, 40.7, 60.8, and 93.5 GHz; Bennett et al. 2003a). The\nanalysis of the first year observations have yielded a 98%\nreliable catalog of 208 point sources brighter than \u223c 1 Jy\n(Bennett et al. 2003b).\nUnbiased radio surveys at 15 GHz, covering 520 deg2 ,\nhave been carried out with the Ryle telescope (Taylor et\nal. 2001; Waldram et al. 2003). Ricci et al. (2004), using a novel wide-band analogue correlator on one baseline of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)\nhave surveyed 1216 deg2 of the southern sky at 18 GHz.\nPreliminary source counts at 30 GHz have been produced\nby the DASI (Kovac et al. 2002), VSA (Grainge et al.\n2003), and CBI (Mason et al. 2003) CMB experiments.\nThe ATCA survey will cover, in the near future,\n104 deg2 at 20 GHz to a flux limit S20GHz > 40 mJy.\nThe Jodrell Bank Observatory \u2013 University of Torun One\nCentimetre Radio Array (OCRA) will begin soon a multibeam survey of the Northern sky at 30 GHz. ESA's\nPlanck satellite will carry out all-sky surveys at 9 frequencies from 30 to 860 GHz with sensitivity several times\nhigher than WMAP.\nAs a new observational window opens up, it is useful\nto utilize models exploiting the available information to\nforetell which source populations the planned surveys will\nbe able to detect as a function of their depth, which redshift range will these survey explore, which information\non formation and evolution of each source population will\nthey be able to provide. Answering these questions is a\nkey step towards an optimal planning of the surveys.\nEarlier time-honored comprehensive analyses of radiosource evolution (Dunlop & Peacock 1990; Toffolatti et al.\n1998; Jackson & Wall 1999) provided remarkably success< 8 GHz, covering sevful fits to data from surveys at \u223c\neral decades in flux-density. The model by Toffolatti et al.\n(1998), in particular, was extensively exploited to estimate\nthe radio source contamination of CMB maps at cm/mm\n\nFig. 1. Integral counts of extragalactic sources in the\nWMAP K-band (centered at 22.8 GHz).\n\nwavelengths (e.g.: Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2003; Vielva\net al. 2003; Herranz et al. 2002; Refregier et al. 2000) and\nturns out to satisfactorily account also for the high frequency counts down to S \u2243 20 mJy, with a maximum\noffset of a factor \u2243 0.7 but only at the brightest fluxes (cf.\nFig. 13 of Bennett et al. 2003). On the other hand, the\ndata that have been accumulating in recent years require\na more detailed treatment of each of the various relevant\nsub-populations.\nIn this paper we present a new analysis encompassing canonical radio source populations as well as a variety of special classes of sources. In Section 2 we describe the model for canonical radio sources, allowing for\ndifferent evolutionary behaviours for two classes of flatspectrum sources (flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac\nobjects) and for steep-spectrum sources, while in Sect. 3\nwe present the data sets used to determine the parameters. In Sect. 4 we work out predictions of counts for starforming galaxies, extreme GPS sources, ADAF/ADIOS\nsources, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects on scales from clusters\nof galaxies to large galaxies, radio afterglows of \u03b3-ray\nbursts. Our main conclusions are summarized and discussed in Sect. 5.\nWe have adopted a flat \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9\u039b =\n0.7 and H0 = 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2. The evolutionary model for canonical radio\nsource populations\nWe have considered different epoch-dependent luminosity\nfunctions (LFs) for two flat-spectrum [flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae type objects (BL\nLacs)], and for steep-spectrum radio source populations.\nThe study by Sadler et al. (2002) of the local radio luminosity function at 1.4 GHz yielded separate estimates for\nsources powered by nuclear activity (AGN) and for star-\n\n\fGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

The fitted\ndata sets are described below and the parameter values\nare listed in Table 1.\n\nOnly in the case of FSRQs enough information is available\nto look (although in a simplified manner) for evidences of\na decline of the space density at high redshifts.

Their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude (Fig. 2) shows a\nclear deficit at |b| < 10\u25e6 . Removing the 4 sources in this\nregion, we are left with 155 sources above the completeness limit, over an area of 10.4 sr. For all these sources we\nhave determined the 4.85\u201322.8 GHz spectral index, using\nthe 4.85 flux densities from the GB6 (Gregory et al. 1996)\nor PMN (available at http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/)\ncatalogs.

Redshift\nmeasurements were found for 86 FSRQs, 27 BL Lacs, 9\nof the unclassified sources flat-spectrum sources and for\n18 steep-spectrum sources. The redshift distributions and\nthe counts of FSRQs (Figs. 3 and 4) and of BL Lacs have\nbeen corrected by a factor of (1+17/119) to include the 17\nunclassified flat-spectrum sources, partitioned among the\ntwo populations in proportion to the number of classified\nsources in each population. In computing the model redshift distributions, the surveyed area has been decreased\nby a factor of 0.94 in the case of FSRQs and of 0.96 in the\n\ncase of BL Lacs, to allow for the incompleteness of redshift measurements. Poisson errors (Gehrels 1986) have\nbeen adopted both for the counts and the redshift distributions.\n\n3.2. The Parkes quarter-Jansky flat-spectrum sample\nThe sample (Jackson et al. 2002) comprises 878 sources\nwith spectral index \u03b15GHz\n2.7GHz \u2264 \u22120.4, selected from several surveys to different depths at 2.7 GHz. The catalog\ncompiled by Jackson et al. (2002) includes optical identifications and redshifts for most of the sources; 827 are compact extragalactic radio sources, 38 have either extended\nradio structure or are Galactic objects, 13 are unidentified (4 of which because of obscuration by Galactic\n\n\fGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nFig. 8.

Of the 827 compact extragalactic radio sources, 624\nare FSRQs, 54 are BL Lacs and 149 flat-spectrum radio\nsources. As in the case of WMAP data, we have subdivided\nthe latter plus the unidentified sources among the FSRQs\nand the BL Lacs, in proportion to the fraction of classified\nsources belonging to each population, i.e. we increase the\ncounts of both populations by a factor 1 + 162/(624 + 54).\nWhile the full sample has been used to derive the differential source counts (shown in Figs. 6 and 7), for the analysis of the redshift distribution we have defined a complete\nsub-sample aiming at maximizing the fraction of sources\nwith measured redshift. To this end, we have first focussed\non areas surveyed to at least 0.25 Jy, keeping only sources\nbrighter than this limit, for a total of 618 sources. Of these,\n437 are FSRQs, 360 of which (82%) have measured redshift, 47 are BL Lacs, only 10 of which (21%) have measured redshift, and 111 are flat-spectrum galaxies (32, i.e.\n29%, with redshift). Clearly, only in the case of FSRQs\nthe fraction of sources with measured redshifts is large\nenough for a meaningful redshift distribution to be de\u25e6\nrived. Further restricting the sample to \u03b4 > \u221250 , we are\nleft with 370 FSRQs, 345 of which (93%) with measured\nredshift, 47 BL Lacs, 95 sources classified as galaxies and\n2 unidentified sources. The redshift distribution of FSRQs\nfor this sub-sample is thus well defined (Fig. 8). As in\nthe case of the counts, we have corrected the redshift distribution by a factor of 1 + (95 + 2)/(370 + 47) to allow\nfor a fraction of flat-spectrum galaxies and of unidentified sources proportional to the ratio FSRQ/(FSRQ+BL\nLacs).\n\n3.3. The K\u00fchr 1 Jy sample\nThe sample (K\u00fchr et al. 1981) comprises 518 sources to\na 5 GHz flux density limit of 1 Jy, over an area of 9.811\n\n5\n\nFig. 9. Redshift distribution of FSRQs in the K\u00fchr et\nal. (1981) sample (histogram) compared with the best-fit\nmodel (solid line).\n\nFig. 10. Differential counts at 5 GHz compared with the\nbest-fit model (solid line). Data from Gregory & Condon\n(1991, asterisks) and Pauliny-Toth et al. (1978a, diamonds; 1978b, triangles).\n\nsr. Based on the catalogued spectral indices, 299 sources\nare flat-spectrum (\u03b1 > \u22120.5, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) and 219 are steepspectrum. The former population includes 212 FSRQs, 200\nof which (94%) have measured redshift, 26 BL Lacs (20 of\nwhich, 77%, with measured redshift, and 61 either classified as galaxies or missing a morphological classification.\nAs before, we have distributed the latter sources among\nFSRQs and BL Lacs, thus increasing the counts of both\ntypes by a factor of 1+61/(212+26). The fit of the redshift\ndistribution of FSRQs is shown in Fig. 9.\n\n\f6\n\nGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nfunction of flat-spectrum sources by Peacock (1985) and\nToffolatti et al. (1987). The fit is shown in Fig. 12.\n\n4. Special source populations\n4.1. Star-forming galaxies\n\nFig. 11. Differential counts at 18 GHz of flat-spectrum\nsources by Ricci et al.

(1987) (asterisks)\ncompared with the best-fit model (solid line).\n\n3.4. Other data sets\nFurthermore, we have fitted the 5 GHz counts (Fig. 10)\nby Gregory & Condon (1991) and Pauliny-Toth et al.\n(1978a,b), the 15 GHz 9C counts plus the 18 GHz ATCA\ncounts (Fig. 5) by Waldram et al. (2003) and Ricci et\nal. (2004), respectively, and the ATCA 18 GHz counts\n(Fig. 11) of flat-spectrum sources (Ricci et al. 2004).\nIn our scheme, blazars (FSRQs plus BL Lacs) account\nfor the entire population of flat-spectrum radio sources.\nWe thus require that the sum of their local luminosity\nfunctions matches the estimates of the local luminosity\n\nThe radio emission of galaxies correlates with their starformation rate, as demonstrated by the well established\ntight correlation with far-IR emission (Helou et al. 1985;\nGavazzi et al. 1986; Condon 1992; Garrett 2002; Morganti\net al. 2004). The cross-over between synchrotron plus freefree emission, prevailing at cm wavelengths, and thermal\ndust emission generally occurs at \u03bb \u2243 2\u20133 mm, so that\nat frequencies of tens of GHz there are contributions from\nboth components, the former being associated to normal\nlate-type and starburst galaxies at low to moderate redshifts, the latter to the high-redshift population detected\nby sub-mm surveys (\"SCUBA galaxies\").\nFollowing Granato et al. (2001, 2004) we interpret\n\"SCUBA galaxies\" as proto-spheroidal galaxies in the\nprocess of forming most of their stars. Their epochdependent luminosity function is computed using the\nphysical model by Granato et al. (2004), which describes\nthe star-formation and chemical enrichment histories and,\ninterfaced with the code GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998),\nyields the spectrophotometric evolution from radio to Xray wavelengths. The values of GRASIL parameters were\ndetermined by Silva et al. (2004) comparing the model\npredictions with a broad variety of observational data.\nNormal late-type and starburst galaxies are dealt with\nin a more phenomenological manner, following Silva et\nal. (2004). Briefly, we adopted the 60 \u03bcm local luminosity functions of \"warm\" and \"cold\" galaxies (based on\nIRAS colors), determined by Saunders et al. (1990), for\nstarburst and late-type galaxies, respectively. The local\nluminosity functions were cut off at L60\u03bcm = 2 \u00d7 1032\nerg/s/Hz. Extrapolations to other wavelengths were made\nusing GRASIL spectral energy distributions fitting the\ndata on NGC 6090 (for starburst galaxies) and NGC 6946\n(for late-type galaxies).\nA density and luminosity evolution model\n(LF [L(z), z] = LF [L(z)/(1 + z)2.5 , z = 0] \u00d7 (1 + z)3.5 )\nwas adopted for starburst galaxies, while a mild pure\nluminosity evolution (L(z) = L(0) (1 + z)1.5) was assumed\nfor normal late-type galaxies. These evolutionary laws\nwere applied up to z = 1. The luminosity functions were\nthen kept to the (comoving) values they have at z = 1 up\nto a redshift cut-off zcutoff = 1.5.\n\n4.2. Extreme GHz peaked spectrum (GPS) sources\nA class of sources that is expected to come out in high frequency surveys is that of extreme GHz Peaked Spectrum\n(GPS) or very high frequency peakers. GPS sources are\n> 25 W Hz\u22121 ), compact ( < 1 kpc)\npowerful (log P1.4 GHz \u223c\n\u223c\nradio sources with a convex spectrum peaking at GHz fre-\n\n\fGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nquencies (see O'Dea 1998 for a comprehensive review).\nThey are identified with both galaxies and quasars.\nIt is now widely agreed that GPS sources correspond to\nthe early stages of the evolution of powerful radio sources,\nwhen the radio emitting region grows and expands within\nthe interstellar medium of the host galaxy, before plunging\nin the intergalactic medium and becoming an extended\nradio source (Fanti et al. 1995; Readhead et al. 1996;\nBegelman 1996; Snellen et al. 2000). Conclusive evidence\nthat these sources are young came from measurements\nof propagation velocities. Velocities of up to \u2243 0.4c were\nmeasured, implying dynamical ages \u223c 103 years (Polatidis\net al. 1999; Taylor et al. 2000; Tschager et al. 2000). The\nidentification and investigation of these sources is therefore a key element in the study of the early evolution of\nradio-loud AGNs.\nThere is a clear anti-correlation between the peak\n(turnover) frequency and the projected linear size of\nGPS sources (and of compact steep-spectrum sources),\nsuggesting that the process (probably synchrotron selfabsorption, although free-free absorption is also a possibility) responsible for the turnover depends simply on the\nsource size. Although this anti-correlation does not necessarily define the evolutionary track, a decrease of the\npeak frequency as the emitting blob expands is indicated.\nThus high-frequency surveys may be able to detect these\nsources very close to the moment when they turn on.\nThe self-similar evolution models by Fanti et al. (1995)\nand Begelman (1996) imply that the radio power drops as\nthe source expands, so that GPS's evolve into lower luminosity radio sources, while their luminosities are expected\nto be very high during the earliest evolutionary phases,\nwhen they peak at high frequencies. De Zotti et al. (2000)\nshowed that, with a suitable choice of the parameters, this\nkind of models may account for the observed counts, redshift and peak frequency distributions of the samples then\navailable. The data indicated strongly different evolutionary properties between GPS galaxies and quasars, at variance with unification scenarios.\nThe models by De Zotti et al. (2000) imply that extreme GPS quasars, peaking at \u03bd > 20 GHz, comprise a\nquite substantial fraction of bright radio sources in the\nWMAP survey at \u03bd \u2243 20 GHz, while GPS galaxies with\nsimilar \u03bdpeak should be about 10 times less numerous. For\na maximum rest-frame peak frequency \u03bdp,i = 200 GHz, the\nmodel predicts about 10 GPS quasars with S30GHz > 2 Jy\npeaking at \u2265 30 GHz over the 10.4 sr at |b| > 10\u25e6 .\nAlthough the number of candidate GPS quasars in the\nWMAP survey is consistent with that expected from the\nmodels, when data at additional frequencies (Trushkin\n2003) are taken into account such candidates look more\nblazars caught during a flare optically thick up to high frequencies. Furthermore, Tinti et al. (2004) have shown that\nmost, perhaps two thirds, of the quasars in the sample of\nHigh Frequency Peaker candidates selected by Dallacasa\net al. (2000) are likely blazars, while 9 out of 10 candidates classified as galaxies are consistent with being truly\nyoung sources.\n\n7\n\nSnellen et al. (2000) support a scenario whereby the\nluminosity of GPS sources increases with time (while the\npeak frequency decreases) until a linear size \u2243 1 kpc is\nreached, and decreases subsequently. Although predictions\nfor GPS source counts have not been worked out in this\nframework, these objects must be very rare at bright high\nfrequency fluxes. In Figs. 13 and 14 we have provisionally\nplotted (dashed line in the upper right-hand panel) the\npredictions of the models by De Zotti et al. (2000) with\na maximum intrinsic peak frequency \u03bdp,i = 200 GHz, decreasing by a factor of 3 the contribution of GPS quasars.\nLarge area high frequency surveys, coupled with\nfollow-up simultaneous multifrequency observations of\nGPS candidates, would be essential to assess the evolutionary properties of this population.\n\n4.3. Late stages of AGN evolution\nHigh radio frequency observations are also crucial to investigate late stages of the AGN evolution, characterized\nby low radiation/accretion efficiency. This matter was recently brought into sharper focus by the discovery of ubiquitous, moderate luminosity hard X-ray emission from\nnearby ellipticals. VLA studies at high radio frequencies\n(up to 43 GHz) have shown, albeit for a limited sample of\nobjects, that all the observed compact cores of elliptical\nand S0 galaxies have spectra rising up to \u2243 20\u201330 GHz\n(Di Matteo et al. 1999).\nThere is growing evidence that essentially all massive ellipticals host super-massive black holes (see, e.g.,\nKormendy & Gebhardt 2001). Yet, nuclear activity is\nnot observed at the level expected from Bondi's (1952)\nspherical accretion theory, in the presence of extensive\nhot gaseous halos, and for the usually assumed radiative\nefficiency \u2243 10% (Di Matteo et al. 1999). However, as\nproposed by Rees et al. (1982), the final stages of accretion in elliptical galaxies may occur via AdvectionDominated Accretion Flows (ADAFs), characterized by\na very low radiative efficiency (Fabian & Rees 1995).\nThe ADAF scenario implies strongly self-absorbed thermal cyclo-synchrotron emission due to a near equipartition magnetic field in the inner parts of the accretion flows,\nmost easily detected at cm to mm wavelengths. However\nthe ADAF scenario is not the only possible explanation\nof the data, and is not problem-free. Chandra X-ray observations of Sgr A, at the Galactic Center, are suggestive\nof a considerably lower, compared to Bondi's, accretion\nrate (Baganoff et al. 2003), so that the very low ADAF\nradiative efficiency may not be required. A stronger argument against a pure ADAF in the Galactic Center is that\nthe emission is strongly polarized at mm/sub-mm wavelengths (Aitken et al. 2000; Agol 2000). Also Di Matteo\net al. (1999, 2001) found that the high frequency nuclear\nradio emission of a number of nearby early-type galaxies\nis substantially below the predictions of standard ADAF\nmodels. The observations would be more consistent with\nthe adiabatic inflow-outflow solutions (ADIOS), developed\n\n\f8\n\nGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nby Blandford & Begelman (1999), whereby the energy liberated by the accretion drives an outflow at the polar region carrying a considerable fraction of the mass, energy\nand angular momentum available in the accretion flow,\nthus suppressing the radio emission from the inner regions.\nBoth the intensity and the peak of the radio emission depend on the mass loss rate.\nWe have estimated the counts yielded by these low\nradiative efficiency flows (LREF) following Perna & Di\nMatteo (2000), i.e. we have taken the number density of\nsuch sources to be given, as a function of redshift, by their\nEq. (5), with a cut-off at z = 1, and have used the emission\nspectrum corresponding to p = 0.2 in their Fig. 1, which\ncorresponds to the upper end of the range of observed\nluminosities. The counts we obtain, shown by the dotted\nline in the upper right-hand panel of Figs. 13 and 14, are\nabout a factor of ten below the estimates by Perna & Di\nMatteo (2000). We do not understand the reason for this\nstrong discrepancy. We note however, that the conclusion\nof these Authors that the 30 GHz LREF counts can be\ncomparable or even higher than those of sources known\nfrom low-frequency surveys is ruled out by the results of\nthe Ryle telescope, ATCA and WMAP surveys.\n\n5. Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects\nThe Sunyaev & Zel'dovich (SZ) effect (Sunyaev &\nZeldovich 1972) arises due to the inverse Compton scatter of CMB photons against the hot electrons. The CMB\nintensity change is given by:\n\u2206I\u03bd = 2\n\n(kTCMB )3\nyg(x)\n(hc)2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere TCMB is the CMB temperature and x = h\u03bd/kTCMB .\nThe spectral form of this \"thermal effect\" is described\nby the function\ng(x) = x4 ex [x * coth(x/2) \u2212 4]/(ex \u2212 1)2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is negative (positive) at values of x smaller (larger)\nthan x0 = 3.83, corresponding to a critical frequency \u03bd0 =\n217 GHz.\nThe Comptonization parameter is\nZ\nkTe\ny=\nne \u03c3T dl,\n(6)\nmc2\n\nwhere ne and Te are the electron density and temperature,\nrespectively, \u03c3T is the Thomson cross section, and the\nintegral is over a line of sight through the plasma.\nWith respect to the incident radiation field, the change\nof the CMB intensity across a cluster can be viewed as a\nnet flux emanating from the plasma cloud, given by the\nintegral of intensity change over the solid angle subtended\nby the cloud:\nZ\nZ\n\u2206F \u03bd = \u2206I\u03bd d\u03a9 \u221d Y \u2261 yd\u03a9\n(7)\nIn the case of hot gas trapped in the potential well due to\nan object of total mass M , the parameter Y in Eq. (7),\n\ncalled integrated Y-flux, is proportional to the gas-massweighted electron temperature hTe i and to the gas mass\nMg = fg M :\nY \u221d fg hTe iM .\n\n(8)\n\nAt the frequencies considered here, the Y-flux is negative\nand can therefore be distinguished from the positive signals due to the other source populations.\n\n5.1. Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects in galaxy clusters\nThe SZ effect from the hot gas responsible for the X-ray\nemission of rich clusters of galaxies has been detected with\nhigh signal to noise and even imaged in several tens of\nobjects (Carlstrom et al. 2002).\nRecent X-ray Chandra observations show that for massive clusters the gas fraction is remarkably constant, fg =\n0.113 \u00b1 0.005, independently of the cluster redshift (Allen\net al. 2002). Simple scaling laws are used to derive, under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis, the relation\nbetween the mass and the temperature of a cluster (see,\ne.g., Barbosa et al. 1996; Colafrancesco et al. 1997; Bryan\n& Norman 1998, and references therein):\n#1/3\n!2/3\n\"\nM\n\u03a9\n\u2206\n(\u03a9\n,\nz)\n0\nc\n0\n(1 + z), (9)\nT (M, z) = T15 h2/3\n180\nM15\nwhere \u2206c is the non-linear density contrast of a cluster\nthat collapsed at redshift z and T15 is the temperature\nof a cluster of mass M15 = 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 which collapses\ntoday. We calculate \u2206c using the equations reported in\nthe appendix of Colafrancesco et al. (1997): the M \u2212 T\nrelation calculated in this way is perfectly consistent with\nEq. (9) of Bryan & Norman (1998). Both simulations and\nobservations indicate that temperatures of massive clusters follow quite well the relationship with mass and redshift expressed by Eq. (9) (see, e.g., Ettori et al. 2004\nand references therein). Nevertheless, there is still some\ndiscussion on the exact value of T15 , whose values range\nfrom 6.6 keV to 8.8 keV (see, e.g., Pierpaoli et al. 2001,\nand references therein). This represents, at the moment,\nthe largest source of uncertainty for the normalization\nof the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuation\nP (k) \u2261 |\u03b4k |2 inferred from the observed cluster X-ray temperature function (XTF). Such normalization is usually\ngiven in term of the value of \u03c38 ,Ri.e. the variance of the den\u221e\nsity perturbation \u03c3 2 (R, z) \u221d o k 3 P (k, z)W 2 (kR)dk/k,\nwhere W (kR) is the windows function corresponding to\nthe smoothing of the density field (see, e.g., Peebles 1993),\non the scale of R = 8h\u22121 Mpc. Lower values of T15 result\nin higher values of \u03c38 and viceversa (see, e.g., Ikebe et\nal. 2002; Pierpaoli et al. 2003). Here we choose T15 =\n7.75 keV, consistent with the simulations of Eke et al.\n(1998), and \u03c38 = 0.85 yielding an XTF consistent with\nthe observed one (see, e.g., Pierpaoli et al. 2003). The\nnumber counts for SZ clusters are then given by:\nZ\nZ\ndV\nN (> \u2206F\u03bd ) =\ndz\ndM N (M, z),\n(10)\ndz\nM (\u2206F\u03bd ,z)\n\n\fGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nwhere N (M, z) is the cluster mass function and the lower\nbound of the mass integral is determined by requiring that\nclusters of mass M > M at redshift z have SZ fluxes\ngreater than \u2206F\u03bd (for details see, e.g., Colafrancesco et\nal. 1997). Here we adopt the mass function of Sheth et al.\n(2001):\n\"\nr\n\u0012\n\u00132p #\n1\n\u03c3(M, z)\n2 a A2\n\u221a\n\u03c10 2 1 +\n*\nN (M, z)dM =\n\u03c0\nM\na\u03b4c\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b4c\nd ln \u03c3\n1 a\u03b4c2\n, (11)\n*\nexp \u2212 2\nd ln M \u03c3(M, z)\n2 \u03c3 (M, z)\nwhere \u03c10 is the present-day mass density of the Universe,\n\u03b4c = 1.68, a = 0.707, A = 0.3222, p = 0.3.\nWe caution that the 20 and 30 GHz counts of cluster\nSZ effects shown in the lower right-hand panel of Figs. 13\nand 14 could be substantially affected by radio-source contamination since radio sources are strongly correlated with\nclusters of galaxies (Holder 2002; Massardi & De Zotti\n2004). Although the available data do not allow a quantitative estimate of the effect on counts, we note that a\nsingle powerful radio source can fill in the SZ decrement\nof a small group of galaxies.\n\n5.2. Galaxy-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects\nEvidences of statistically significant detections at 30 GHz\nof arcminute scale fluctuations well in excess of predictions for primordial anisotropies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) have recently been obtained by the\nCBI (Mason et al. 2003) and BIMA (Dawson et al. 2002)\nexperiments. The interpretation of these results is still debated. Extragalactic sources are potentially the dominant\ncontributor to fluctuations on these scales and must be\ncarefully subtracted out. And indeed both groups devoted\na considerable effort for this purpose. However a quite substantial residual contribution to the CBI signal is difficult\nto rule out (De Zotti et al. 2004; Holder 2002), while the\nresidual radio source contamination of the BIMA results\nis likely to be very small.\nIf indeed the detected signal cannot be attributed to\nextragalactic radio sources, its most likely source is the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect (Gnedin & Jaffe\n2001). The small-scale fluctuations due to the SZ within\nrich clusters of galaxies has been extensively investigated\n(Komatsu & Kitayama 1999; Bond et al. 2002). The estimated power spectrum was found to be very sensitive to\nthe normalization (\u03c38 ) of the density perturbation spec> 1, somewhat higher than indicated by other\ntrum. A \u03c38 \u223c\ndata sets, is apparently required to account for the CBI\ndata.\nOn the other hand, significant SZ signals may be associated to the formation of spheroidal galaxies (De Zotti et\nal. 2004; Rosa-Gonzalez et al. 2004). The proto-galactic\ngas is expected to have a large thermal energy content,\nleading to a detectable SZ signal, both when the protogalaxy collapses with the gas shock-heated to the virial\ntemperature (Rees & Ostriker 1977; White & Rees 1978),\n\n9\n\nand in a later phase as the result of strong feedback from\na flaring active nucleus (Ikeuchi 1981; Natarajan et al.\n1998; Natarajan & Sigurdssson 1999; Aghanim et al. 2000;\nPlatania et al. 2002; Lapi et al. 2003).\nThese SZ signals, showing up on sub-arcmin scales, are\npotentially able to account for the BIMA results. Protogalactic gas heated at the virial temperature and with\na cooling time comparable with the expansion time may\nprovide the dominant contribution. It must be stressed,\nhowever, that estimates are plagued by large uncertainties\nreflecting our poor understanding of the complex physics\ngoverning the thermal history of the proto-galactic gas,\nand, as stressed by the authors themselves, the counts\nof galactic scale SZ effects computed by De Zotti et al.\n(2004) may be more conservatively viewed as upper limits. Furthermore, the radio emission from the galaxy can\npartially fill in the SZ dip, particularly if the galaxy hosts\na radio active nucleus (Platania et al. 2002).\nOn the other hand, the SZ effect turns out to be an\neffective probe of the thermal state of the gas and of its\nevolution, so that its detection, that may be within reach\nof future high frequency surveys (cf. the lower right-hand\npanel of Figs. 13 and 14) would provide unique information on early phases of galaxy evolution, essentially unaccessible by other means.\n\n5.3. Radio afterglows of \u03b3-ray bursts\nThe afterglow emission of GRBs can be modelled as synchrotron emission from a decelerating blast wave in an\nambient medium, plausibly the interstellar medium of\nthe host galaxy (Waxman 1997; Wijers & Galama 1999;\nMeszaros 1999). The radio flux, above the self-absorption\n< 5 GHz, is proportional to \u03bd 1/3 up\nbreak occurring at \u223c\nto a peak frequency that decreases with time. In the upper right-hand panel of Figs. 13 and 14 we show (dotdashed line) the estimates of the counts of GRB afterglows\n(kindly provided by B. Ciardi) yielded by the Ciardi &\nLoeb (2000) model. According to these estimates, a large\narea survey at \u2243 1 cm to a flux limit \u2243 1 mJy should discover some GRBs (see also Seaton & Partridge 2001).\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nA synoptic view of the contributions of the above source\npopulations to the 20 and 30 GHz differential counts is\npresented in Figs. 13 and 14. As expected, and directly\ndemonstrated by the high frequency 9C (Taylor et al.\n2001; Waldram et al. 2003) and ATCA (Ricci et al. 2004)\nsurveys, the dominant population at bright flux densities are blazars. These are, however, a composite population, including the rapidly evolving Flat Spectrum Radio\nQuasars and the slowly evolving BL Lac objects. The former sub-population is prominent above \u2243 100 mJy, but\nits counts converge rapidly at fainter flux densities, eventually falling below those of steep-spectrum sources and\napproaching those of BL Lacs.\n\n\f10\n\nGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\nFig. 13. Predicted differential counts at 20 GHz for various extragalactic source populations. Upper left-hand panel\n(classical radio sources): FSRQs (dotted line); BL Lacs (dashed line); steep-spectrum sources (triple dot-dashed line).\nUpper right-hand panel (special sources): ADAFs (dotted line); extreme GPS quasars and galaxies (dashed line);\nGRB afterglows (dot-dashed line). Lower left-hand panel (star-forming galaxies): proto-spheroids (dotted line); spirals\n(dot-dashed line); starburst galaxies (dashed line). Lower right-hand panel: SZ effects on galactic scales (dotted line)\nand on cluster scales (dashed line). The sum of contributions shown in each panel and the overall total counts are\nindicated by a thin and thick solid line, respectively.\n\nThe Figs. 13 and 14 also show that ongoing high frequency surveys are not far from serendipitous observations\nof cluster SZ effects, easily recognizable because they show\nup as negative peaks.\nIt is well known very deep surveys at 1.4 \u2013 8.4 GHz\nthat a large fraction of micro-Jy radio sources are moderate redshift active star forming galaxies (Gruppioni et\nal. 2001; Fomalont et al. 2002; Chapman et al. 2003). Our\nmodels are consistent with these results, and indicate that\nbelow a few tens of \u03bcJy (at 20\u201330 GHz), there is a further\nchange in the composition of the radio-source population\nas proto-spheroidal galaxies come into play, suddenly increasing the ratio of star forming to classical radio sources.\nSince these objects are predicted to be at typical redshifts\nof 2\u20133 and to be highly obscured by dust, there appearance will also increase the fraction of optically very faint\nsources and strongly shift to higher redshifts the redshift\ndistribution.\nThe emission of star forming galaxies in the spectral region of interest here is dominated by synchrotron\n\nand free-free processes at rest-frame wavelengths longer\nthan a few mm, and by thermal dust radiation at shorter\nwavelengths. The latter emission is characterized by a\nsteeply inverted spectrum, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 , with \u03b1 \u223c 4, causing\na strongly negative K-correction and a sharp steepening\nof the counts. Counts of proto-spheroidal galaxies could\nbe significantly higher than shown in Figs. 13 and 14 if\nthe mm excess detected in our own Galaxy, combining\nArcheops with WMAP and DIRBE data (Bernard et al.\n2003; Dupac et al. 2003), and in NGC1569 is a general\nproperty of the SED of dusty galaxies.\nBelow \u2243 100 \u03bcJy the 20\u201330 GHz a significant contribution to the counts may come from Sunyaev-Zeldovich\n(1972) signals (De Zotti et al. 2004; Rosa-Gonzalez et al.\n2004) or free-free emission (Oh 1999) produced by protogalactic plasma. While no attempts to estimate the counts\nof proto-galactic free-free sources have been produced yet,\nwe show in Figs. 13 and 14 the tentative estimates of the\ncounts of SZ effects by De Zotti et al. (2004), that, as\n\n\fGianfranco De Zotti et al.: High-frequency radio surveys\n\n11\n\nFig. 14. Same as in Fig. 13, but at 30 GHz.\n\npointed out by the authors, should be more conservatively\ninterpreted as (possibly generous) upper limits.\nAcknowledgements.
