We consider two cases of trapping, one\nby a box of size L and the other by a harmonic trap. Our analytic calculations are supported\nby numerical works. We also present numerical results on the harmonically trapped randomly\naccelerated particle and the randomly accelerated particle with viscous drag.\n\nThe phenomenon of persistence has attracted a lot of\ninterest in the recent years, both theoretically [1]-[9] as\nwell as experimentally[10]-[12]. The word \"persistence\"\nitself conveys the meaning of survival. Associated with\nthis survival is the survival probability p(t). It is simply\nthe probability that the local field has not yet changed\nits sign upto time t. For a wide range of models the\nsurvival probability decays as a power law, that is\np(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is a new non-trivial exponent called\nthe persistence exponent. Established results, exist\nfor many models- Random Walk problem, Diffusion\nproblem [1],Ising Model with Glauber dynamics [2],\nSurface growth [6], Phase ordering kinetics [5].\nIn an experimental setup,however,finite size effects appear because of the size of the apparatus and boundary\neffects come into play in the dynamics of the system. As\na result the survival probability also depends on the finite size parameter. A particularly clear example of the\ncrossover effects induced by finite size is the recent experiment on a single polystyrene sphere in a harmonic\npotential [19] It is this demonstration of crossover effect\nthat has motivated us in our present work in investigating the finite size effect on the survival probability and\nhow it scales with the finite size parameter.\nThere has been an investigation of this for the Ising\nsystem in higher dimension [20] which lead to the conclusion that finite size scaling in the usual sense holds for\npersistence as well. The system that we investigate here\ndo not show finite size scaling in exactly that sense, although they exhibit pronounced finite size effects. We\nhave considered an analytically solvable model in the\npresent work- the case of a brownian particle confined\nin a box and the case of a brownian particle trapped\nby a harmonic potential. We find that the survival\nprobability P (t, L) does not have the usual scaling form\nP (t, l) \u223c t\u2212\u03b8 f ( Ltz ), with f (x) \u2192 constant for x \u2192 0 and\nf (x) \u223c x\u03b8 for x >> 1. Instead, we find that P (t, L) can\n\n\u2217 e-mail:tpdc2@mahendra.iacs.res.in\n\u2020 e-mail:tpjkb@mahendra.iacs.res.in\n\nbe expressed as P (t, L) = t\u2212\u03b8 f ( Ltz ) but f (x) \u2192 0 exponentially as x \u2192 \u221e. This is consistent with the generic\nform anticipated by Redner[21]. The exponent z is found\nto be 2.0 as in the case of Manoj and Ray [20].\nThe simplest of all the models for which there exists\nan established result is the Random walk problem. A\nrandom walker obeys a differential equation of the form\ndx(t)\n= \u03b7(t) where \u03b7(t) is a white noise. To find the surdt\nvival probability we ask the question whether the quantity sgn[x(t)\u2212 < x(t) >] has changed its sign upto time\nt. The survival probability P0 (T ) in terms of the variable\n\u03c3 = sgn(X(T )) can be found from A(T ) =< \u03c3(0)\u03c3(T ) >\n[1]. In this case P0 (T ) = (2/\u03c0)sin\u22121 [exp(\u2212\u03bbT )]. For a\nrandom walker \u03bb = 1/2 and the survival probability goes\nas P0 (T ) \u223c exp(\u2212T /2) [18]. Analytical and numerical\n1\nresult show that the probability goes as p(t) \u223c t\u2212 2 and\n1\nthe persistence exponent in this case is \u03b8 = 2 [18].\nWe have investigated the finite size effect in the\nrandom walk problem in two ways. Firstly, the random\nwalker is constrained to move in a box with reflective\nboundaries at x = \u00b1L The probability distribution\nP (x, t) in this case obeys a diffusion equation [14] with\nan appropriate boundary condition. Solution to the\ndiffusion equation with the proper boundary condition\ngives P (x, t). In the second problem, the random walker\nis trapped in a harmonic potential. Both the problems\nare analogous to each other with the identification\n\u03c9 \u223c L1 . In both cases we calculate the correlator\na(t1 , t2 ) =< x(t2 )x(t1 ) >, where x(t) is the value of x\nat time t. To make it a Gaussian Stationary Process\nx(t)\n(G.S.P) we transform x(t) to X\u0304 = p\nand a\n< x2 (t) >\nsuitable transformation for the time variable from t to\nT . Thus the correlator a(t2 , t1 ) \u2192 f (|T2 \u2212 T1 |). From\nthe correlator f (T ) we get the survival probability p(t).\nWe first consider a particle in one-dimension performing random walk. The equation governing the dynamics\nof the particle is given by\ndx(t)\n= \u03b7(t)\ndt\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the particle and \u03b7(t) is\na random function whose moments are given by\n< \u03b7(t) > = 0\n< \u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 ) > = D\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient. In the present\nproblem we confine the motion of the particle within a\ncage with boundaries at x = \u00b1L. The boundary of the\ncage is reflective that is upon reaching the boundary the\nparticle is reflected to the nearest lattice site.\nThe probability P (x, t) that the coordinate is x at a\ntime t starting from x = 0 at t = 0 obeys the diffusion\nequation\n2\n\n\u2202P (x, t)\n\u2202 P (x, t)\n=D\n\u2202t\n\u2202 2x\n\n(3)\n\nwith proper boundary condition. Since the particle is\nreflected from the boundary, the particle current x = \u00b1L\nmust be zero. Thus at the boundary\n\u2212D\n\n\u2202P (x, t)\n\u2202x\n\nIn the limit L \u2192 \u221e, all the modes in the summation of\nEq.(7) must be considered. It is then easy to see that\n\n=0\n\n(4)\n\nx=\u00b1L\n\nThe solution to Eq.(3) with the boundary condition\nEq.(4) can be written as\nn\u03c0x \u2212 n2 \u03c022Dt\nL\nP (x, t) = cos(\n) e\nL\n\n(5)\n\nThe complete form of the probability P (x, t) taking into\nconsideration the normalization can be written down as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\nn2 \u03c0 2 Dt\n1\n1 X\nn\u03c0x\nP (x, t) =\n(6)\ne\u2212 L2\n+\ncos\n2L L n=1\nL\n\n< (\u25b3x)2 >\u2192\n\n\u221e\nn2 \u03c0 2 Dt\nL2\n4L2 X 1\ncos(n\u03c0)e\u2212 L2\n+ 2\n2\n3\n\u03c0 n=1 n\n\n< (\u25b3x)2 >\u2192 2Dt for L \u2192 \u221e and t finite\n\nThis is the exact answer. As expected it exhibits finite\nsize scaling and can be cast in the form\nt\nL2\ng( )\n3 L2\n\n(11)\n\nas expected. Keeping in mind our future need where\nf (x) \u2192 1 as x \u2192 0 but decays very fast for x >> L,\nwe will express Eq.(7) as an approximate which is easy\nto handle. This is done using the Euler-Maclaurin sum\nformula for the two sums in Eq.(9).\n\u03c0 2 Dt\n\nKeeping only e\u2212 L2 from among the different exponential decays and working to O( Lt2 ) the coefficient of\ne\u2212\n\n\u03c0 2 Dt\nL2\n\nthe crossover function can be written as\nZ\nn2 \u03c0 2 Dt\nL2\n2L2 2\n1\n< (\u25b3x)2 >=\n\u2212 2\ndn 2 e\u2212 L2\n3\n\u03c0\nn\n\u0013\u0012 1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nD\u03c0 2 t \u2212 \u03c02 Dt\n1\n1\n1+\ne L2\n+ 2\u2212\n\u03c0\n3\nL2\n\n(12)\n\nA more drastic approximation yields the expression\nd2 x(t) 2 \u0014\ndt2 L\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u03c0 2 Dt\nDt\n1\u2212 1 + (\u03c0 2 \u2212 6) 2 e\u2212 L2\n3\nL\n(13)\nThe part in the bracket is the approximation for the function g( Lt2 ). For Lt2 \u2192 \u221e, Eq.(13) correctly reduces to\nt\nL2\n3 , while for L2 << 1, we expand Eq.(13) to obtain\n< (\u25b3x)2 >=\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nDt\n< (\u25b3x) >= 2Dt 1 \u2212 \u03b3 2\nL\n2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\n(7)\n\n< (\u25b3x)2 >=\n\n(10)\n\nand taking the opposite limit we find that\n\nThe average of the square of the displacement is given by\n< (\u25b3x)2 > =\n\nL2\nfor t \u2192 \u221e and L finite\n3\n\n(8)\n\nsuch that g( Lt2 ) \u221d Lt2 for Lt2 \u2192 0 (i.e infinite system size)\nand g( Lt2 ) \u2192 1 for Lt2 \u2192 \u221e that is the extreme case of\nfinite system.\nTo see this the sum in Eq.(7) can be decomposed as\n\u0012\n4L2 X 1 \u2212 n2 \u03c022Dt\nL2\nL\ne\n\u2212 2\n< (\u25b3x)2 >=\n3\n\u03c0\nn2\nn odd\nX 1 \u2212 n2 \u03c02 Dt \u0013\nL2\ne\n(9)\n+\n2\nn\nn even\n\n\u03b3 = \u03c0 2 (1 \u2212\n\n\u03c02\n)\n12\n\n(15)\n\nThe leading term in Eq.(14) is the correct limit for the\nunbounded system and the second term is the first correction for finite L.\nWe now proceed to calculate the correlator <\nx(t2 )x(t1 ) > for the dynamics of Eq.(1) keeping in mind\nthe approximations used in arriving at Eq.(13) for <\n(\u25b3x(t))2 >. Considering the equation for the probability distribution (Eq.(3), we write down the expression\nfor P (x2 , t2 ; x1 , t1 ) the probability of finding a value x2\nat t = t2 if the value was x1 at t = t1 .

To obtain a Gaussian Stationary Process,\nit is necessary to calculate the correlation of X\u0304 = \u221ax(t)\n2\nx (t)\n\nand this leads to complicated looking expression. To express the final answer in a particularly simple form, we\nuse the regime Lt2 << 1 and then exponentiate to find\n< X\u0304(t2 )X\u0304(t1 ) >=\n\nr\n\n1)\nt1 \u2212\u03b3 D(t2 \u2212t\n2L2\ne\nt2\n\n(18)\n\nThis exponentiation is predicted by the generic form anticipated by Redner. In the process of our calculation,\nwe find the numerical prefactors which are not present\nin the general arguments of Redner. For comparison\nwith the numerical simulations, these prefactors are essential. We now perform the transformation in time\nt \u2192 T = lnt + \u03b3Dt\nL2 .

The probability was obtained by averaging over 106 configurations. Numerically obtained value\nof \u03b3\u0304 is 0.9482. This discrepancy can be attributed to the\n1\napproximate form of Eq.(18). A semi-log plot of t 2 p(t)\nDt\nvs L2 is shown in Fig 1. This clearly shows the validity\nof Redner's generic form and the reasonableness of our\napproximations in arriving at the numerical value for \u03b3\u0304\nand the fact that z = 2.\nWe next consider a particle trapped in a harmonic potential and acted upon by a random force.

For \u03c9 \u2192 0 the above expression for\nprobability reduces to the normal random walk problem\n1\nand the probability p(t) goes as t\u2212 2 . The numerical data\nis obtained for three values of \u03c9. For t < 1/\u03c9 2 the estimated value of the exponent by fitting the log-log plot\nwith a straight line is found to be \u03b8 = 0.5055.\nFinally we present numerical studies of the survival\nprobability for a harmonically trapped randomly accelerated particle and for randomly accelerated particle with\nviscous drag. The persistence exponent for the randomly\naccelerated particle is \u03b8 = 0.25 [15]-[17]. The equation of\nmotion for the particle is\nd2 x\n+ \u03c9 2 x = \u03b7(t)\ndt2\n\nFIG. 3: log-log plot of survival probability vs time. The solid\nline is the best fit line. The estimated persistence exponent\nby best fit is \u03b8 = 0.2502.\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b7(t) is a gaussian white noise with correlator given\nby Eq.(2a) and Eq.(2b). Rescaling \u03c4 = \u03c9t we see that\nfor \u03c4 << 1 or t << 1/\u03c9 the first term domainates and\nthe equation is motion is that of a randomly accelerated particle. A plot of survival probability vs time is\nshown in Fig. 3. With \u03c9 behaving as L1 as noted above,\nthis corresponds to z = 1 for the dynamic component.\nThe survival probability is obtained by averaging over\n105 configurations.\n\nd2 x\ndx\n+\u0393\n= \u03b7(t)\ndt2\ndt\n\n(33)\n\nThis is the crossover which is of particular interest in\nthe experiment of Ref [19]. As can be seen from our results the cross over in the form of the correlation function\noccurs at t \u223c \u03931 . In this case however two regimes exists. For t << 1/\u0393 the equation of motion is that of a\nrandomly accelerated particle with the first term dominating and for t >> 1/\u0393 the second term domainates\nand the equation of motion is that of a random walker.\nThus the survival probability also shows a crossover from\nthe randomly accelerated regime to random walk regime.\nThe estimated values of the exponents in the two regimes\nis tabulated below.\nvalue of \u0393 \u03b8 for t < 1/\u0393 \u03b8 for t > 1/\u0393\n0.8\n0.2638\n0.4970\n0.1\n0.2510\n0.4888\n0.01\n0.2538\n0.4797\nNumerically obtained values of survival probability is\nplotted against time in Fig. 4. The survival probabilities\nis obtained by averaging over 105 configurations. One of\nthe important finding of Ref [19] was that in the realistic\nsituation of the experiment the crossover in < (\u25b3x)2 >\noccurred for t >> \u03931 . This was attributed to a memory dependent damping term. In a future work, we will\nexplore the effect of it on the persistence problem.\n\nAcknowledgement:\nD.C acknowledges Council for Scientific and Industrial\nResearch, Govt. of India for financial support (Grant\nNo.- 9/80(479)/2005-EMR-I).\n\n\f5\n0.36788\n\nsurvival probability p(t) in log\n\nscale\n\n0.13534\n\n0.04979\n\n0.01832\n\n0.00674\n\n0.00248\n\n9.11882E-4\n\n1\n\n20.08554\n\n403.42879\n\n8103.08393\n\ntime in log scale\n\nFIG. 4: log-log plot of survival probability vs time.\n\n[1] Majumdar,S.N., Cire,C.J., Bray,A.J. and Cornell,S.J.,\nPhys.
