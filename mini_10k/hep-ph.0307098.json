Introduction\nCosmic rays were discovered about ninety years ago by Hess and Kohlh\u00f6rster [2]. Through\nall these years they have provided a rich source of vital information on our galaxy and\nthe universe beyond to astrophysics. Until the early nineteen fifties experimental particle\nphysics could use only cosmic rays as the \"incoming beam\" for creating members of the particle zoo never seen before, like muons, pions, kaons, the lambda etc. However, the emerging\naccelerator physics with its well-controlled experimental environment put the interest in\ncosmic ray observations to the back burner as far as particle physics was concerned. During\nthe last decade or so a dramatic turn-about took place. Atmospheric and solar neutrino\ndetectors gave the first hint to the somewhat clueless particle physics community on the\nphysics beyond the hugely successful, nevertheless incomplete Standard Model. Reactor\nand accelerator neutrino experiments gave confirmation of those cosmic ray results just last\nyear. The limit on cosmic diffuse gamma radiation background by EGRET [3] combined\nwith measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum at the highest energies provides restrictions\non possible grand unified theories.

K\u00f6vesi-Domokos\n\nTwenty-sixth Johns Hopkins Workshop\n\nEye [5] supplies bounds on larger than four dimensional models with low scale gravity [6].\nThese are just some examples for the renewed interest in using observations concerning\nastrophysical processes and properties of the hot big bang cosmology as possible tests for\npredictions of theories going beyond the Standard Model [7].\n\n2. The significance of the high energy end of the spectrum\n\n1\n\nAround this energy and above it the effect of the deflection by the galactic and intergalactic magnetic\nfields is small enough that with reasonable certainty a \"source box\"of a few degrees can be defined even for\ncharged incoming cosmic particles.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\nPrHEP JHW2002\n\nA simplistic characterization of the measured cosmic ray spectrum affirms its isotropy,\na composition, which is overwhelmingly hadronic (protons and nuclei) and a power law\n(\u221d E \u2212\u03b1 ) energy dependence through about ten orders of magnitude from 1010 eV to\n1020 eV. There are two energy regions, \u2248 4 \u00d7 1015 eV and \u2248 1018.5 eV (named the \"knee\"\nand the \"ankle\", respectively) where \u03b1 changes quite abruptly: \u03b1 \u2248 2.7 for E . 1015.5\neV, \u03b1 \u2248 3.1 for 1015.5 eV. E . 1018.5 eV and \u03b1 \u2248 2.8. for E & 1018.5 eV. For more details\nsee [8]. Although a considerable number of substantially improved old detectors as well\nas new ones will provide crucial experimental observations for the \"knee area\" in cosmic\nrays [8], for GeV and TeV gamma-rays and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 for neutrinos in the near future,\nthe present paper brings into focus only the ultra high energy region of the cosmic ray\nspectrum.\nThe CM energy per particle at the Tevatron and at the LHC (1 TeV and 7 TeV,\nrespectively) fall between the knee and the ankle on the cosmic ray spectrum, corresponding\nto fixed target energies \u2248 1015 eV and \u2248 1017 eV. The highest energy event ever recorded\nhas energy 3\u00d71020 eV (by the Fly's Eye detector [9]), which is equivalent to about 500 TeV\nin the CM system; otherwise, its extensive air shower (EAS) fits the properties of a proton\nor maybe a nucleus induced shower [10]. Clearly, at the high energy end of the spectrum\nthe primary and some of the secondary interactions at the top of the atmosphere involve\nprocesses never tested in accelerator experiments; moreover, the highest energy events\ncertainly scrutinize physics beyond the electroweak scale.\nIn addition, the region above the ankle presented the GZK puzzle. Up to about 1019 eV\nenergy the universe is transparent for protons, although the interaction with the everywhere\npresent regular and chaotic magnetic fields takes away the directional information pointing\nback to their source. However, above that energy protons produce e+ e\u2212 pairs and more\nimportantly pions1 on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation . At the energy\n1019.5 eV the mean free path for protons is down to about 7-8 Mpc and at each collision\nthey lose about 20 \u2013 25 % of their energy. Consequently, the expectation [1] was that there\nshould be a cutoff and just under the cutoff a pileup (a bump on the spectrum) as a consequence of the pion photoproduction for the above threshold protons or nuclei [11]. (Nuclei\nphotodisintegrate on the CMB and photons are absorbed (through e+ e\u2212 production) on\nthe CMB and on the universal radio background.)\nThere are somewhat less than a hundred extensive air showers observed with energies\nabove 1019.5 eV and about ten events above 1020 eV. The arrival directions are compat-\n\n\fS. K\u00f6vesi-Domokos\n\nTwenty-sixth Johns Hopkins Workshop\n\n3. GZK evading messengers\nThere are two large classes of models which can provide interpretation for the data, top\ndown and bottom up models3 .\nTop down models [20, 21] all use physics beyond the Standard Model. Topological\ndefects and long lived relic particles could be produced everywhere during phase transitions\nexperienced by the Universe after the Big Bang. Through their collapse/decay they produce\nthe small number of EECR (protons) and dominantly photons and neutrinos.Their major\nadvantage is that they avoid the problems of long range propagation in the background\nphoton \"gas\", as well as the difficulties of accelerating particles to extreme energies. The\nart in the construction of these models is to make the required flux of EECR without\ncreating too large a contribution to the diffuse gamma ray background bounded by the\nresults of the EGRET detector [3]. Horizontal EAS (zenith angle larger than 60\u25e6 ) give\nlimits for the neutrino flux.\nBottom up scenarios all face the acceleration problem. However, if \u2013 as a first step \u2013\none can assume that the sources can be outside of the GZK sphere (RGZK \u2248 couple of\ntens Mpc), then the number of sites able to produce EECR increases considerably. Among\nStandard Model particles only the neutrino can handle cosmic distances without dramatic\nabsorption4 . Both the Z-burst model and models inspired by string theory of d > 4 use\nEECR neutrinos to increase the pool of sources.\n2\n\nIf the effect of the random extragalactic magnetic fields are taken into account, in addition to the energy\nloss processes, the average GZK distance of a proton further decreases [13] [14].\n3\nFor completeness, we must add the possibility of Lorentz symmetry violation, which could eliminate\nthe GZK cutoff completely [20, 21].\n4\nIn principle, some supersymmetric particles can have their GZK cutoff at higher energies than the\nnucleons. However, LEP2 already excluded light superpartners. [20, 21]\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\nPrHEP JHW2002\n\nible with an isotropic distribution of sources. Wherever determination was possible, the\nproperties of the primary particles starting the EAS were consistent with being hadrons.\nThere is considerable disagreement on the errors of EAS energy estimates, on the\nfiner features of the spectrum, and on the statistical significance of the data among the\ncollaborations [15, 16, 17, 9, 4], which provided the observations. The recent analysis of the\ndata already on file, the improvement of statistics by the continued operation of AGASA\nand HiRes, and by the future observations of new detectors (under construction like the\nPierre Auger Observatory [18], and the planned Owl/Airwatch [19]) the reliability of the\nobservational data will substantially improve in the next couple of years.\nThe propagation of nucleons, nuclei and gamma rays was studied in detail [12] with\nthe conclusion that their sources cannot be very distant (at most \u2248 50 \u2212 70 Mpc away)2 .\nThere are only a few astrophysical sources, which can possibly accelerate particles to these\nextreme energies (e.g. AGN-s, radio galaxies). Since few of these objects are in the\n\"GZK sphere\" and the requirement of isotropy of the incoming extreme energy cosmic\nrays (EECR) also presents a severe restriction on their origin, the community started\nlooking for new explanations for the higher than expected number of particles at the very\nend of the spectrum.\n\n\fS. K\u00f6vesi-Domokos\n\nTwenty-sixth Johns Hopkins Workshop\n\nThe \"Z-burst\" models [22] need no particle physics beyond the Standard Model (apart\nfrom non-zero neutrino masses) and assume standard hot Big Bang cosmology. They\nassert that extreme energy neutrinos (E= MZ2 /2m\u03bd ) forming Z bosons resonantly with\nantineutrinos of the neutrino halo around our galaxy (or supergalaxy) could produce enough\nprotons well inside the GZK radius to account for the EECR. The difficulties with this\nmodel were pointed out in ref. [12, 14]. Basically, the necessary requirements on the high\nenergy neutrino flux and/or on the density of halo neutrinos make the scenario (nearly)\nincompatible with other astrophysical observations.\n\nIn all string inspired models the neutrino nucleon cross section is above the Standard Model\nvalue at very high energies. Internal consistency of string theories requires that strings live\nin a multidimensional space (typically, d=10 for superstrings). It has been realized a few\nyears ago that the connection between the string scale and the Planck scale is less rigid\nthan hitherto believed [23].\nIn some models with large compactified extra dimensions, (or with a four-dimensional\nbrane world) together with TeV scale quantum gravity [24] EECR neutrinos interact gravitationally with the nucleons in the atmosphere; as a matter of fact, that becomes the\ndominant interaction [25]. Unfortunately, the gravitational interaction does not give rise\nto a sufficiently rapidly growing cross section [26]. As a consequence, observational bounds\non deep (nearly horizontal) showers are violated and it is not possible to reach cross sections comparable to hadronic ones around the GZK cutoff. The production of \"mini black\nholes\" has been also studied [26, 27]. Presently, it is unclear whether the upper bounds on\ndeep showers are compatible with these theories.\nAt present, there is no internally consistent, phenomenologically viable string model\nknown, in which even the basic features of the dynamics \u2013 including a mechanism of\ncompactification \u2013 would be satisfactorily understood. Nevertheless, various string models\nhave so many attractive properties that one is tempted to abstract their robust features and\nsee whether some reasonable conjectures can be made once CMS energies of the colliding\nparticles reach the string scale [14, 28]. For the sake of argument, let us have a string scale\nof the order of 50 - 100 TeV in mind. This can be reached in ultra high energy cosmic\nray interactions: for instance, the \"gold plated\" Fly's Eye event mentioned before has\nabout 500 TeV in the CMS. It was shown by means of an explicit calculation [29, 26] that\nweakly coupled string models cannot explain the trans-GZK cosmic ray interactions. Since\nwe cannot calculate within the framework of a strongly coupled theory, we use features\nof current models, which are likely to be present in future, phenomenologically successful\ntheories. The following basic ingredients are used:\n\u2022 Unitarity of the S-matrix.\n\u2022 A rapidly rising level density of resonances in dual models.\n\u2022 Unification of interactions at around the string scale, hereafter denoted by M .\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\nPrHEP JHW2002\n\n4.

K\u00f6vesi-Domokos\n\nTwenty-sixth Johns Hopkins Workshop\n\n\u2022 Duality between resonances in a given channel and Regge exchanges in crossed channels.\nSince duality between resonances and Regge poles is exact only in the tree approximation\nto a string amplitude, it is unclear what the precise form of a generalization to world sheets\nof higher genus is: probably, resonances of finite width are dual to Regge cuts. Thus, our\nformulae are likely to be valid to logarithmic accuracy. Using the optical theorem, the total\ncross section for the neutrino-parton interaction is5 :\n(4.1)\n\nj\n\nwhere, as usual, \u03b7 and \u03b4 stand for the elasticity coefficient and phase shift of a given partial\nwave, respectively. The quantity N (\u015d) is the level of the resonance, equal to the maximal\nangular momentum. For elastic resonances, \u03b7 = 1 and \u03b4 \u2248 \u03c0/2 within the width of the\nresonance. Close to the threshold of the string regime, on resonance the total cross section\nis just proportional to the number of states at a given level. In any realistic model the\nresonances have finite widths, thus we average the cross section over an energy interval\ncomparable to the widths of the resonances. In such an approximation, the density of\nstates, d (\u015d) can be introduced and N is regarded as a continuous variable, such that\nN \u2248 \u015d/M 6 . Using this, one gets from eq. (4.1):\n\u03c3\u0302 \u2248\n\n16\u03c0\nd (\u015d) .\n\u015d\n\n(4.2)\n\nAs inelastic channels open up, the elasticity coefficients in eq. (4.1) become less than unity\nand eq. (4.2) is no longer valid. Without any detailed knowledge of the inelastic channels\n(world sheets of a higher genus in present day string models), we can estimate the behavior\nof the cross section as \u015d \u2192 \u221e only. Duality tells us that the leptoquark excitations should\nbe dual to the exchange of the Z-trajectory in the t-channel. Hence, apart from logarithmic\ncorrections,\n\u03c3\u0302 \u223c \u015d(\u03b1(0)\u22121) ,\n(4.3)\nwhere \u03b1(0) is the intercept (branch point, respectively) of the Z trajectory. Apart from\ncorrections of the order of (MZ /M )2 , one has \u03b1(0) = 1, so that the neutrino-parton cross\nsection tends to a constant. (We verify a posteriori that MZ /M \u226a 1, so that the power\ncorrections to the cross section are insignificant at all energies of interest.)\nThe level density is a rapidly rising function of \u015d. It is known that asymptotically it\np\nrises as exp(a \u015d/M ), with a being some constant; see, for instance [30]. However, the rise\nis more rapid at the beginning of the spectrum. The first few levels of the open superstring\ncan be well interpolated by the function\nd(N ) \u221d exp 1.24N,\n5\n\nN \u2248 \u015d/M,\n\n(4.4)\n\nAll energies are assumed to be large compared to the rest energies of the incoming particles.\nIn the last formula, the Regge intercept has been neglected. However, we shall see shortly that the\nexcitations begin to contribute significantly to the cross section for N \u2265 10 or so; hence this approximation\nis justified.\n6\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\nPrHEP JHW2002\n\nN (\u015d)\n8\u03c0 X\n(2j + 1) (1 \u2212 \u03b7j cos (2\u03b4j )) ,\n\u03c3\u0302(\u015d) =\n\u015d\n\n\fS.

General considerations on a strongly coupled string model take us this\nfar. To connect the low excitation regime, eq (4.2) and the asymptotic one, eq. (4.3)\nwe chose an interpolating function guided by merely the requirement of simplicity. We\nfound that after averaging over the parton distribution within the nucleon, the results are\ninsensitive to the detailed form of the \u03bd-quark cross section. For that reason, we chose a\nsimple form satisfying the limits at low and high excitations:\n\u03c3\u0302 = \u0398 \u015d \u2212 M 2\n\n\u015d\nM2\n\n40 exp 1.24N0\nexp 1.24 (N0 \u2212 \u015d/M 2 )\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn eq. (4.5), M is the string scale and N0 is a parameter measuring the onset of\nthe \"new physics\". In fact, one can convert that dimensionless parameter into an energy\nscale. Using our previous relations, one can write N0 \u2248 s\u02c60 /M , or in terms of a laboratory\nenergy of the incoming neutrino, N0 \u2248 2mE\u02c60 /M , m being the mass of the nucleon. In\nall these equations, the \"hat\" over the energies involved serves as a reminder that the\nquantities have to be integrated over the parton distribution. As usual, the conversion is\ncarried out by means of substitutions such as \u015d = xs, x being the momentum fraction of\na parton within the nucleon. The step function is inserted because the cross section of\nthe \"new physics\" vanishes at CM energies below the mass of the first resonance. The\nparton distributions have been taken from CTEQ6 [31]. The dominant contribution comes\nfrom valence quarks; gluons do not contribute, since no presently known unification scheme\ncontains \"leptogluons\". Finally, the contribution of the sea is negligibly small, since the\nlatter is concentrated around x = 0.\nIt is impossible to precisely determine the two parameters, M and N0 entering eq. (4.5).\nNevertheless, the parameters can be bounded by the trans-GZK data. As it was mentioned\nbefore\n\u2022 no deep showers have been observed by AGASA and Fly's Eye,\n\u2022 the trans-GZK showers appear to be \"hadron-like\", i.e. they originate high in the\natmosphere and appear to exhibit a development resembling proton induced showers.\nThese constraints were analysed [32]. The absence of deep showers excludes a region of\nthe neutrino cross section, approximately, 0.02 mb \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1 mb. The cross section has\nto grow fast to roughly hadronic size around the \"ankle\" in the cosmic ray spectrum,\napproximately at 5 \u00d7 1019 eV and stay of this size or grow slightly. Unless these conditions\nare satisfied, the neutrino model of trans-GZK cosmic rays fails. A search of the parameter\nspace yields E0 \u2248 5 \u00d7 1010 GeV and M \u2248 80 TeV. With these values of M and N0 the\ncross section is rising sufficiently rapidly to satisfy the deep shower bound and at the same\ntime, it is sufficiently large in the trans-GZK energy region. These values of E0 and M\ngive N0 \u2248 15.6 confirming the intuitive expectation. The neutrino-nucleon cross section is\nshown in Fig. (1).\nDue to the exponential dependence of eq. (4.5) on the parameters, one cannot vary\ntheir values over a broad range without getting a contradiction either with the bound on\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\nPrHEP JHW2002\n\n\u0001 16\u03c0\nM2 1 +\n\n\fS.

Mikulski[33]. Similarly to earlier\nstudies, see, e.g. [34] it was assumed that quarks and leptons are created in comparable\nnumbers in an interaction as long as the CM energy of an interaction remains above M .\nOnce the energy drops below M , the usual Standard Model cross sections govern the further\ndevelopment of the shower. A qualitative consequence of this feature is that, statistically,\nneutrino induced showers exhibit larger fluctuations than proton induced ones, see [34]7 .\nIn addition, once the cross section becomes larger than about 15-20 mb, the shower starts\nhigh in the atmosphere. Hence, on an event by event basis, such showers are virtually\nindistinguishable from hadron induced showers\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe trans-GZK energy region presents a unique opportunity to get hints on the qualitative\nfeatures of theories going beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysics, these extensive\nair showers may bring information either about cosmologically early times or about the\nmost violent regions in the Universe. To be able to distinguish among these numerous\nimaginative scenarios, the collection of high statistics data is necessary. In the near future\nthis will become possible with the continued operation and improvements of AGASA and\nHiRes and with the start of the hybrid (grand array and air fluorescence) megadetactor,\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory.\n\n6.
