Under the assumption that the force acting on an\nelectric charge is given by the sum of the electromagnetic fields produced by any other charged particles in its neighborhood, we prove\nthat the vector potential of the electromagnetic field has to be considered for the balance of kinetic momentum. The theory cannot be\nquantized in the usual form-because it involves a mass matrix that\ndepends on spatial variables-and the Hamilton's function becomes\nsingular at a distance equal to the geometric mean of the electrodynamic radiuses of electrons and protons.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn previous works [1] [2], we have shown that, according to classical\nmechanics and electrodynamics: a neutral system of electric charges\nthat passes through a region where there is an inhomogeneous magnetic field, experiences a force, even if its internal kinetic angular momentum is equal to zero. Given that this challenges the common interpretation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment-as evidence that there\nare intrinsic angular momenta-we have considered necessary to study\nthe motion of systems of electric charges where the internal magnetic\nforce is not neglected, as it is usual in common classical treatments.\n\n1\n\n\fIn this paper we study the motion of electric charges under electromagnetic interaction. Neglecting radiative effects, we assume that the\nforce acting on an electric charge is given by the sum of the electromagnetic fields produced by any other particles in its neighborhood.\nFrom the invariance of the Lagrange's function, we find that the vector potential of the electromagnetic field must be considered for the\nbalance of linear and angular momentum, thus predicting a classical\nBohm-Aharonov Effect.\nA Hamilton's function is obtained also for the system of two particles. The result is a theory that cannot be quantized but approximately in the usual form, since it involves a mass matrix that depends\non spatial variables. Also, the Hamilton's function becomes singular\nwhere the distance between the particles satisfies the relation:\nr=\n\ne2\n.\nc2 (me mp )1/2\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we include a section where the Lagrange's function and the equations of motion for the center of mass\nand the vector of relative position are obtained.\n\n2\n\nThe General Law of Motion\n\nWe study the classical motion of an electron and a proton, under\nelectromagnetic interaction.\nNeglecting any retardation and/or radiative effects, we use the\nformulas\n\u03c6(~x, t) =\n\n~v (t)\nq\n~ x, t) = q\nand A(~\n,\nk~x \u2212 ~r(t)k\nc k~x \u2212 ~r(t)k\n\n(1)\n\nto find the electrodynamic potentials associated to a punctual charge\nr\nq moving along the path ~r(t).

In consequence, the center of mass of the\nsystem,\n~ = me~re + mp~rp ,\n(16)\nR\nme + mp\ndoes not move according to Newton's First Law. This was expected\ngiven that equations 4 & 5 are not in compliance with Newton's Third\nLaw either.\nIn the case of a system of n particles with masses m1 , * * * , mn and\ncharges q1 , * * * , qn , the Lagrange's Function assumes the form\nL=\n\nn\nX\n1\ni=1\n\n2\n\nmi~vi 2 \u2212\n\n1 X qi qj\n2 q 6=q rij\ni\n\nj\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212\n\n~vi * ~vj\nc2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nTherefore, the generalized momentum of the ith particle is\np~i = mi~vi +\n\nqi ~\nqi X qj ~vj\n= mi~vi + A\nri ),\ni (~\nc j6=i c rij\nc\n\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\f~ i is the vector potential of the magnetic field produced by the\nwhere A\nother particles.\nGiven that the function 17 is also invariant under arbitrary translations and/or rotations, we come again to the conclusion that the\nsum of the generalized momenta and the angular momentum, are constants of motion. Therefore, as it has been confirmed by Bohm and\nAharonov[3], the vector potential of the electromagnetic field acting on\neach particle must be considered for the balance of linear momentum.\nThe problem of gauge invariance is not an issue for us. Under the\ngauge transformation\nL\u2032 = L +\n\nn\n\u2202\u03bb X\n\u2202\u03bb\n+\n~vi *\n\u2202t i=1\n\u2202~ri\n\n(19)\n\nthe momenta are transformed as:\np~i \u2032 = p~i +\n\n\u2202\u03bb\n;\n\u2202~ri\n\n(20)\n\nIf the sum of the momenta is going to be a constant of motion, \u03bb must\nbe invariant under arbitrary translations. In other words\nn\nX\n\u2202\u03bb\ni=1\n\n\u2202~ri\n\n= ~0,\n\n(21)\n\nand, in those circumstances:\nn\nX\n\n~pi \u2032 =\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\n~pi .\n\ni=1\n\nGoing back to the electron-proton system, its energy\nE=\n\n1\ne2 ~vp * ~ve e2\n1\nme~ve2 + mp~vp2 \u2212 2\n\u2212\n2\n2\nc\nr\nr\n\n(22)\n\ne2\n1\n= (p~e * v~e + p~p * ~vp ) \u2212 ,\n2\nr\nis also a constant of motion.\nSolving 12 and 13 for the velocities, we find\n~ve =\n\np\n~e\nme\n\ne2 p\n~p\nme mp c2 r\ne4\nme mp c4 r 2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\n5\n\n(23)\n\n\fp\n~p\nmp\n\n~vp =\n\ne2 p\n~e\nme mp c2 r\ne4\nme mp c4 r 2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\n(24)\n\nFrom this and 22 we get the Hamilton's Function\nH=\n\np\n~e2\n2me\n\n+\n\np\n~p2\n2mp\n\n1\u2212\n\nWhere\nr >>\n\n\u2212\n\ne2 p\n~e p\n~p\nme mp c2 r\n\ne4\nme mp c4 r 2\n\ne2\nc2 (me mp )1/2\n\n\u2212\n\ne2\n,\nr\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nthis function coincides with the function used in [4] to approximate\nthe eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum system.\nFurther, we notice that 25 is singular where\nr=\n\ne2\n.\nc2 (me mp )1/2\n\n(27)\n\nAt this distance the equations of motion 4 and 5 cannot be solved\nfor the accelerations, which is fundamental for the applicability of the\ntheorem of existence and uniqueness of solutions. Therefore, even\nif the Principle of Least Action is valid, to determine a particular\nsolution additional conditions have to be imposed. There are another\ntwo possibilities which we shall not investigate further in this paper:\n1. That inequality 26 defines the limits of validity of electrodynamics.\n2. That a fully relativistic approach is required. In this case the\neffects of retardation have to be considered; the equations of motion are difference-differential equations; and there is not room\nfor a variational approach. (At least not for a variational approach that does not explicitly accounts for the action of the\nentire electromagnetic field.)\n\n3\n\nSeparation of the Internal Motion\n\nAs it was shown before, the center of mass of the system does not\nmove according to Newton's First Law.
