The role invariants play in the description of the world is best captured by E. Taylor\nand J. A. Wheeler [1] in the statement:\n\"In relativity, invariants are diamonds. Do not throw away diamonds!\"\nInvariants are an indispensible working tool of every professional physicist and an unavoidable\ntopic in almost any Physics textbook.\nAnd yet the concept of invariance and invariant characteristics turns out to be more subtle than\nusually perceived. There are some important aspects of invariance which, to my knowledge, have\nnot been explicitly stated in literature. In particular, what is usually referred to as just\n\"invariants\" actually fall into a few quite different categories. Ignoring this fact, as shown below,\nleads to confusion, and frequently causes misleading or downright wrong statements. This paper\noutlines four distinct kinds of invariants \u2013 four faces of Lorentz-invariance \u2013 and shows that one\nof them is just a misconstruction reflecting a widely spread misconception, which is still being\ndisseminated among generations of Physics students.\nSorting out the known invariant characteristics of physical systems by their properties also\nhelps elucidate very close analogies between some of them. Specifically, an analogy between\nmass and time \u2013 the two observables describing totally different aspects of reality \u2013 enables us to\nsee the twin paradox from a different angle.\nI. FACE 1\nThe first category can be called the operational invariance. Most physical characteristics of a\nsystem or process (e.g., mass, size, time, etc.) can be measured using an executable experimental\nprocedure that can be performed in any inertial reference frame (RF) and/or for any state of\nmotion of the studied system. If such a procedure finds a certain quantity numerically the same\nirrespective of the RF used, then this quantity is an operational invariant.\nThe simplest example is a number N of stable particles in an isolated system, which is the same\nfor all observers 1 .\nAnother invariant in this category is the electric charge Q. Its independence from velocity is\nevident in many known experiments. As an example, consider the electron-positron annihilation\ne + e+ \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 under two different conditions: first, in a positronium \"atom\" when the\nvelocities of both particles are negligible; and second, in a high-energy collision with only one\nparticle (\"target\") stationary and the other one moving with an ultra-relativistic speed. In both\ncases the net charge of the system after annihilation is zero, which (assuming the net charge is\nconserved) shows that the charge of the bombarding particle is the same as in its stationary state.\nBy reciprocity this also means its independence from the observer's state of motion. This puts\nthe charge into the category of operational invariants.\nII. FACE 2\nNext we consider the most famous of all invariants \u2013 the speed of light in vacuum. It has a\nrather subtle distinction from the operational invariants. On the one hand, it seems to be\ndeterminable as the former through a procedure which is the same in all RF (e.g., the Michelson\nexperiment) and gives the same result in all of them. But on the other hand, the subject of direct\nmeasurement (free photons with a definite momentum) does not have a rest frame. And it is not a\n1\n\nWe assume \"regular\" particles \u2013 photons and/or tardyons; for tachyons, the situation may be different\n[2].\n2\n\n\fquantity like charge Q or occupancy N whose independence from speed is established in this\nexperiment, but rather the speed itself that is the same for all photons regardless of their\nmomentum and for all observers. Moreover, it turns out to be the same for all objects of nature,\nif we, instead of 3-velocity v, measure their 4-velocity u defined as [3, 4]\nuj \u2261 c\n\ndx j\n,\nds\n\nj = 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n(1)\n\nHere ds is the norm of an incremental 4-displacement along the world line of the corresponding\nobject (for the reasons discussed in [5], a more meaningful definition would be using ds\ninstead of ds). The speed of light turns out to be the norm of 4-velocity of any object \u2013 unlike the\noperational invariants, it satisfies the identity:\n\nc 2 \u2261 u02 \u2212 u 2 = u j u j\n\n(2)\n\nHere subscripts and superscripts on the right stand respectively for the co- and contravariant\ncomponents of a 4-vector, and the Einstein summation rule is assumed. In terms of 4-velocity, all\nobjects of nature flow through space-time with the speed of light, and the only difference\nbetween a photon, a rocket, and a stationary rock in this regard is in the tilt of their respective\nworld lines. Thus, the speed of light is more than just an invariant \u2013 it is a universal constant, the\nsame for any object. Therefore it can be called an absolute or universal invariant, which, unlike\nN or Q , is a single-valued quantity.\n\nIII. FACE 3\nThe invariants in the third category are the rest mass, proper time, and proper distance.\nA: Rest mass. Traditionally (before 1905) mass was defined as the ratio f / a of a net external\nforce f to resulting acceleration a . Measurements at v << c did not show any noticeable change\nof mass in a moving object. In this respect, mass was thought to be in one company with electric\ncharge.\nRelativity changed all this. Both \u2013 the theory and new experiments \u2013 showed that mass as a\nmeasure of body's inertness is velocity-dependent. Moreover, this dependence is different for\ndifferent orientations between f and v. Measuring mass as the ratio f / a when f \u22a5 v , that is,\nm = f \u22a5 / a\u22a5 , gives the well-known expression\nm = m0 \u03b3 (v) ,\n\n\uf8eb v2 \uf8f6\n\u03b3 (v ) \u2261 \uf8ec 1 \u2212 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed c \uf8f8\n\n\u22121 / 2\n\n(3)\n\nFor f \u0001 v , that is, for the ratio f \u0001 / a\u0001 , measurements give m = m0 \u03b3 3 (v) . In both expressions m0\nis the rest mass of the object.\nMass (3) determined when f \u22a5 v , is known as the transverse mass and is identical to the\nrelativistic mass discussed below; mass determined when f \u0001 v , is the longitudinal mass [3, 4].\nFor an arbitrary orientation of f and v, the resulting acceleration is not even parallel to the force,\nand f cannot generally be represented as f = m a with a scalar-valued coefficient m, even if as a\n\n3\n\n\ffunction m ( v ) [5, 6]. Nevertheless, the relativistic generalization of the second law can be\nformulated not only in terms of Minkowski's 4-force, but also in terms of 3-vectors f and a for\nany orientation between f and v [3 - 5]. Such formulation involves \"anisotropic mass\" as a\nsecond-rank 3\u00d7 3 tensor, which can be linked to the spatial part of the 4 \u00d7 4 energy-momentum\ntensor, and is especially convenient in relativistic mechanics of continuous mediums [7 - 10].\nHere it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to case (3). It has been extensively studied for charged\nparticles in a magnetic field, for which the condition f \u22a5 v is automatically satisfied. The\nexperiments showed an increase of mass with velocity [11] even before the advent of the theory\nof relativity, and later [12] they confirmed Eq. (3) unambiguously. The results were applied to\nthe development of synchrotron accelerators [13, 14].\nAs mentioned above, Eq. (3) also defines relativistic mass. Apart from and independently of\n(3), relativistic mass is defined as the ratio p / v , where p is particle's momentum. We thus have\ntwo different procedures yielding the same result, and accordingly two equivalent definitions:\nrelativistic mass (3) defined either as f \u22a5 / a\u22a5 or as p / v ; it is a speed-dependent and therefore not\ninvariant characteristic. This is an experimental fact that cannot be dismissed.\nThe expression (3) for relativistic mass is consistent with the general mass-energy equivalence\n\nE = m c2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the relativistic energy E is not invariant either, but is only the temporal component of 4momentum.\nSpeed dependence of the relativistic mass was, perhaps, one of the factors that triggered the\nquestion of whether such characteristic should be considered at all. There is a fashionable trend\nto consider only the rest mass as a legitimate description of an object, denying the relativistic\nmass the status of a meaningful characteristic [15 \u2013 17]. According to this view, there is only the\nrest mass m0 , and the relation (4) must be applicable only to the rest mass and rest energy,\nrespectively, that is, we must reduce it to\nE0 = m0 c 2\n(5)\n(here and hereafter the subscript \"0\" stands for a quantity measured in the rest frame of an\nobject). This \"truncation\" of Eq. (4) is merely a suggestion which cannot invalidate the equation\nitself. Indeed, expressing E0 in (5) in terms of E from the Lorentz-transformation of 4momentum,\nE\nE = \u03b3 (V ) ( E0 \u00b1 Vp0 ) = \u03b3 (V ) E0 ,\nE0 =\n(6)\np0 = 0\n\u03b3 (V )\none immediately recovers (4) with m = \u03b3 (V ) m0 . As Feynman explicitly emphasized in his\n\"Lectures on Physics\" [18], \"The total energy of a particle is its mass in motion times c2 ( E = mc 2 ),\nand when the body stops, its energy is its rest mass times c2 ( E0 = m0 c 2 )\"\nThe universal nature of mass-energy relation was emphasized in many sources as exemplified in\n[19]: \"Physical manifestations of the aspects of matter corresponding to mass and energy, respectively,\nare different; but the quantitative characteristics of these aspects are universally proportional to one\nanother. It is this universal proportionality that allows one to speak about the mass-energy equivalence\".\n\n4\n\n\fSummarizing this part, we can say that the rest mass of an object is a scalar-valued coefficient\nconverting its 4-velocity u into 4-momentum P , whereas its relativistic mass is a scalar-valued\n(but speed-dependent) coefficient converting its 3-velocity v into 3-momentum p.\nAlready the mere fact that we have to distinguish between just mass and the rest mass shows\nthat the rest mass is not an operational invariant defined in part I. The existence of at least one\nverifiable experiment recording velocity dependence of mass (or any other observable)\nautomatically takes it out of domain I. Within I, we do not talk about the \"rest\" charge and\n\"relativistic\" charge. Unlike charge, the rest mass is (up to the factor c) the norm of a 4momentum P = ( E / c , p ) :\n\nE2\nm c = 2 \u2212 p2 = p j p j ,\nc\n2\n0\n\n2\n\nj = 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n(7)\n\nThis is used for determining m0 when it cannot be measured directly in its rest frame (e.g., in\nhigh-energy physics). We measure instead E and p, and then calculate m0 from (7). The\nmeasurements must be very accurate since in the ultra-relativistic case the computed value of m0\ncomes out as a small difference between two large numbers.\nIt is argued sometimes that the norm (7) (divided by c) must be taken as the general definition\nof mass. One cannot dispute a definition, but one can dispute its consistence with other elements\nof reality. In the real world, an entity called mass manifests itself through its inertia which is\nmeasurable under various conditions, and a special but important subset of conditions ( f \u22a5 / a\u22a5 )\ngives the result (3) called the relativistic mass. This result is consistent with both \u2013 ( p / v ) and\nthe general Eq. (4). So definition (7) determines the rest mass only.\nThus, the rest mass is a relativistic invariant without being an operational invariant. But its\nvalue measured in its rest frame can also be computed as the norm of the particle's 4-momentum\nmeasured in an arbitrary RF. This kind of invariant can be called a rotational invariant or a\nnorm-invariant since it is not affected by rotations in space-time.\nThis becomes self-evident if we use the \"forbidden\" relationship (4) to rewrite (7) as\nm02 = m2 \u2212\n\np2\nc2\n\n(8)\n\nSince p 2 = p 2 and p / m = v , we can also write this as\n\uf8eb\np2 \uf8f6\nm2\nm = m \uf8ec1 \u2212 2 2 \uf8f7 = 2\nm c \uf8f8 \u03b3 (v )\n\uf8ed\n2\n0\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\nEq-s (7) - (9) clearly show that m0 (not m!) is the norm of a 4-vector. The quantities m and p / c\non the right of (8) are the \"temporal\" and \"spatial\" projections of this 4-vector in the energymomentum (or mass-momentum) space. In this interpretation, the velocity dependence of the\nrelativistic mass is a natural geometrical effect, since different velocities correspond to different\n4-rotations of a given RF with respect to the rest frame of the object, and accordingly to different\nvalues of the temporal projection of its 4-momentum. Thus, we have the energy-momentum\n\n5\n\n\frelation (7) or mass-momentum relation (8), but both terms, albeit expressing different aspects of\nmatter, are equally legitimate, and which one to use is a matter of taste but not the matter of\nprinciple, in view of the total mathematical equivalence of (7) and (8).\nB: Proper time. Consider a time-like 4-displacement between two events:\n2\n2\n2\nsAB\n= c 2 tAB\n\u2212 rAB\n> 0\n\n(10)\n\nHere A and B label the respective end-points of the interval sAB , tAB \u2261 tB \u2212 tA is the time\nbetween the events in a given RF, and rAB = rB \u2212 rA is the spatial displacement between them.\nIn the proper frame K0, where both events happen at one place ( rAB = 0 ), A and B are on its\ntemporal axis. Setting rAB = 0 in (10) gives\n\n\u03c4 AB =\n\nsAB\nc\n\n(11)\n\nHere \u03c4 AB is the time lapse between the events in the proper frame, which is the definition of the\nproper time between the events. For rAB \u2260 0 , we can use (11) to rewrite (10) in the form\nanalogous to (8), (9):\n\n\u03c4\n\n2\nAB\n\n=t\n\n2\nAB\n\n2\n2\nrAB\ntAB\n\u2212 2 = 2\n; tAB = \u03c4 AB \u03b3 (V ) ;\n\u03b3 (V )\nc\n\nV\u2261\n\nrAB\ntAB\n\n(12)\n\nThe right side of this expression describes the time dilation effect. As seen from (12), the\npossibility of writing \u03c4 AB as the norm of the corresponding time-like 4-displacement rests on this\neffect. Like the rest mass, the proper time can be measured directly in K0, or computed as the\nnorm of the corresponding 4-interval, which puts it into the category of norm-invariants.\nThere is perhaps a less known analogy between the rest mass of an object and the proper time\nof a process, which, in my opinion, deserves a sub-title.\n\nRest mass \u2013 proper time analogy\nThis is an analogy between a system of non-interacting particles, on the one hand, and a\nsuccession of consecutive processes within a single moving object, on the other. The analogy is\neasily seen and yet has evaded recognition in literature.\nStart with the rest mass. For a system of moving non-interacting particles, its rest mass M 0 is\nthe sum of the relativistic masses m j of the particles in the system's rest frame (not the sum of\ntheir rest masses m0 j ) [3, 5, 6, 15, 20]\nM0 = \u2211mj =\nj\n\n\u2211m\n\n0j\n\n\u03b3 (v j ) \u2265\n\nj\n\n\u2211m\n\n0j\n\n= m0\n\n(13)\n\nj\n\n(the latter sum amounts to the rest mass m0 of the system with all particles at rest).\nMany textbooks on Relativity express this property by saying that the rest mass is a nonconserved characteristic of a system. Such statement is totally misleading since the term\n\n6\n\n\f\"conserved\" is related to something that remains unchanged during the time evolution of an\nisolated system. In this context, \"non-conservation\" of the rest mass would mean, by virtue of\nEq. (5), non-conservation of the rest energy of such a system.\nThe appropriate statement about (13) is that the rest mass is a non-additive characteristic of a\nsystem [5]. The geometry of this non-additivity is shown in Fig. 1.\nConsider now, instead of system of masses, a single moving object T (equipped with a clock),\nstarting from a certain point O in space (event A) and later returning to the same point (event B).\nIf we choose event A as the origin of the corresponding frame K0, then both A and B lie on the\ntime axis of this frame (Fig. 2). Let p denote the net momentum of the system of masses (13) and\nr \u2013 the net spatial displacement of T between A and B. Just as setting p = p 0 = 0 determines the\nrest frame of the system of masses, setting r = r0 = 0 determines the proper inertial frame K0 for\nprocess AB. The term \"proper\" here reflects the fact that K0 is the rest frame of another object S\nremaining at O during the whole round trip of T. This draws a sharp distinction between frame\nK0 thus defined and frame K co-moving with T, which is not inertial. The net 4-displacement\nsAB of T (the geometrical sum of its incremental 4-displacements) is identical to that of S, but\ntheir respective proper times are different. One can see from Fig. 2 that sAB is equal (up to the\nconstant c) to proper time of S between events A and B. In other words, it is the proper time\n\u03c4 AB (S) along the world line of S. Alternatively, this proper time can be obtained as the sum of\ndilated times of the individual sub-processes in T as observed from K0\n\n\u03c4 AB (S) = \u2211 \u2206t j = \u2211 \u2206\u03c4 j \u03b3 (v j ) \u2265\nj\n\n\u2211 \u2206\u03c4\n\nj\n\n= \u03c4 AB (T)\n\n(14)\n\nj\n\nThe algebraic sum of their proper times \u2206\u03c4 j on the right of Eq. (14) amounts to the proper time\n\n\u03c4 AB (T) along the world line of T.\nThe Eq-s (13) and (14), while describing the behavior of quite different physical characteristics,\nare mathematically identical. Accordingly, the behavior of proper time is totally analogous to\nthat of the rest mass. Like the rest mass, the proper time is a non-additive characteristic of an\narbitrary process as measured from K0. Explicit formulation of this analogy gives another view\nof and another way for explaining the twin paradox. It may be helpful in demystifying the\nparadox when teaching it to students. From the viewpoint of (14) this \"paradox\" (dependence of\nproper time \u03c4 AB on path connecting A and B [1, 3]) is just another manifestation of nonadditivity of proper time, similar to non-additivity of the rest mass. In the example illustrated in\nFig. 2, the net proper time measured by the S-clock is the proper time of a Stationary twin (Sam)\nresiding at O. The algebraic sum of the proper times of the incremental sub-processes measured\nby the T-clock is the proper time of the Traveling twin (Tom). Just as the rest mass of a system is\ngreater than the sum of individual rest masses of its moving constituents, the proper time of the\nstationary twin is greater than the sum of the consecutive proper times (net proper time) of\ntraveling twin between their parting and reunion. Just as the rest mass of a system is exactly\nequal to the sum of relativistic masses of its moving parts, the proper time \u03c4 AB (S) is exactly\nequal to the sum of dilated times of the consecutive incremental sub-processes within moving\nobject T. The relation (3) between the relativistic mass of an object and its rest mass is identical\nto relation (12) between the dilated time of a process and its proper time; this is quite natural in\n\n7\n\n\fview of the fact that mass is the temporal component of 4-momentum just as time is the temporal\ncomponent of 4-displacement.\nThe above-mentioned trend to discard the concept of relativistic mass might be one of the\nfactors that blocked this beautiful analogy from view even though it was exposed since the onset\nof the theory of relativity, begging for recognition.\n\nC: Proper distance. Consider now two events A and B separated by a space-like interval, that\nis\n2\n2\n2\nsAB\n= c 2 tAB\n\u2212 rAB\n< 0\n\n(15)\n\nIn such case we can find a RF where both events happen simultaneously, and the interval (15)\nreduces to pure distance r AB between them. In this RF we have tAB = 0 and get\n\nrAB\nThe value\n\nrAB\n\n= sAB\n\n(16)\n\ndefines the proper distance between the two events [1, 15]. The corresponding\n\ninertial frame K0 where tAB = 0 can be called the proper frame.\nCombining (15) and (16) shows that the proper distance is the norm of the corresponding 4vector sAB = (ctAB , rAB ) :\n2\n2\n2\nrAB\n= rAB\n\u2212 c 2 tAB\n\n(17)\n\nWe can write it as\n\nr 2AB = rAB2 \uf8eb\uf8ec1\u2212 c 2 \uf8f7\uf8f6\n2\n\n\uf8ed\n\nu \uf8f8\n\n,\n\nu=\n\nrAB\n>c\ntAB\n\n(18)\n\nHere u can be considered as the speed of a fictitious superluminal particle connecting the end\npoints of a space-like interval (15).\nThe expression (18) seems to be different from Eq-s (9) and (12) for the rest mass and the\nproper time. But this is only an apparent difference, since (18) is expressed in terms of\nsuperluminal speed of a fictitious particle. We can also express it in terms of the relative speed V\nbetween frames K and K0. From Lorentz transformation between these frames, one obtains the\nsimple relation between u and V [2, 5]\nuV = c 2\n(19)\nUsing this, we can bring (18) to the form\n\nr 2AB =\n\n2\nrAB\n;\n\u03b3 2 (V )\n\nrAB = rAB \u03b3 (V )\n\n(20)\n\nAgain, we see the total mathematical equivalence between (17), (20) and (8),(9) ,\n(10, 12). The proper distance can be either measured directly in the proper frame K0 or computed\nas the norm of s AB through (17); alternatively, it can be computed from rAB and V using (20).\nThus, the proper distance is in one company with the rest mass and proper time. And this\n\n8\n\n\fanalogy also extends onto the situations when the interval (17) is the geometric sum of a number\nof sub-intervals \u2206s j (Fig. 3). Then we can express the net proper distance r AB as the sum of the\nspatial components \u2206rj of these sub-intervals:\n\nr AB = \u2211 \u2206rj = \u2211 \u2206rj \u03b3 (V j ) \u2260 \u2211 \u2206r\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\n(21)\n\nj\n\nHere V j is relative velocity between the proper frame K0 of sAB and the proper frame Kj of a\nsub-interval \u2206s j . As seen from Fig. 3, the above-considered analogy between the rest mass and\nthe proper time can be extended to the proper distance: the latter, while being an invariant, is not\nan additive characteristic of a system of events.\nSummarizing this part, we can say that each of the rotational invariants \u2013 m0 , \u03c4 AB , rAB \u2013 can\nbe computed as the norm of its respective 4-vector from its components. These invariants are\ndifferent from c (which is also invariant under 4-rotations) in that the latter is the norm of a 4velocity of any object; and by virtue of being single-valued it does not require any computing.\n\nIV. \"FACE\" 3 + 1\nFinally, we turn to the fourth category. The quotation mark in its name reflects the fact that it is\nmerely a mask rather than a real face, with no actual invariant under it. It contains the proper\nlength of an object. This well-known observable has been proclaimed an invariant due to a\ngeneral oversight. The proper length has nothing to do with the proper distance described in the\nprevious section. There is a widely spread confusion between these two different concepts. It has\nreached such a scale that we can describe it by words of D. Hestenes (said on a different but\nrelated occasion [21]) as \"the conceptual virus\" spread in the Physics community. This virus is\nmanifest in numerous misleading or just wrong statements even in some authoritative sources.\nHere is one taken from Wilkipedia:\n\"In relativistic physics, proper length is an invariant quantity which is the rod distance between\nspacelike-separated events in a frame of reference in which the events are simultaneous.\"\nThe first part of this statement claims that it is about proper length. The second part is the\ndefinition of the proper distance. The combination of two, as we will see later, makes the whole\nstatement, using the Pauli famous expression, not even wrong. In particular, as the rod's state of\nmotion is not specified here, it may as well be a moving rod whose edges are instantly coincident\nwith two events simultaneous in the given frame, in which case the quoted statement defines the\nproper distance as the Lorentz-contracted length of the rod rather than its proper length.\nHere are two more quotations, this time from the Forum of Physics Educators [22]:\n\"...the Lorentz-contracted length is merely a spatial projection of a 4-displacement with its norm\nbeing the proper length.\"\n\"The\" length of a ruler is invariant under ordinary rotations, even though the projection of the ruler\nonto this-or-that reference frame will in general change. In a profoundly analogous way, \"the\" length of\nrulers and \"the\" timing of clocks is invariant under rotations in the XT plane, i.e. boosts, i.e. changes in\nvelocity. It is only the shadow cast on this-or-that reference frame that changes. Do not confuse a shadow\nwith the real object that casts the shadow\".\n\n9\n\n\fSuch statements come from and are shared by a significant part if not majority, of the physics\ncommunity. Both statements are false, and, when taught to students, promote the abovementioned viral infection to the status of the world-wide pandemic.\nThat the first statement is false, is immediately evident from a very simple observation: in\nLorentzian geometry, the norm of a space-like 4-displacement is less than its spatial projection\n(see (18) or (20)), whereas the proper length of a rod is greater than its Lorentz-contracted\nlength. Therefore, the proper length is not the norm of a 4-vector, and the Lorentz-contracted\nlength is not its \"shadow\".\nFor the same reason the second statement, making the proper length \"profoundly analogous\" to\nthe invariant length under ordinary 3-rotations, is also false. And the claim that proper length is\nin one company with proper time makes it double-false.\nOne of the possible sources of confusion between the two characteristics is the fact that both \u2013\nLorentz contraction and time dilation \u2013 are consequences of the relativity of time, and either of\nthem implies the other one [2, 5]. This logical equivalence, however, does not imply identical\nphysical behavior, and indeed, we know that proper time, in contrast to proper length, is shorter\nthan its \"shadow\" \u2013 the dilated time. Nevertheless, the logical equivalence of the two effects was\nmisconstrued by many into physical equivalence between them, which promoted the proper\nlength to the same status as the proper time. This automatically led to identifying the proper\nlength with proper distance, which is, indeed, in one category (Part III, C) with proper time.\nProbably the best cure against the confusion between these totally different concepts would be\nreformulation of physics in the language of Geometric Algebra [21, 23 - 25], but this requires\ntime and concerted effort. Here we will just show that the above misconceptions can be easily\nclarified within the framework of the existing formulation. We consider a few examples\nillustrating the difference between proper distance and proper length.\nTake a solid rod of constant proper length l0 . If we are in the rest frame K0 of the rod and want\nto measure its length, it is not necessary that we mark the end-points simultaneously in K0.\nMoreover, if we are to consider the l \u2194 l0 (length \u2013 proper length) relationship for a fixed 4displacement with simultaneous marking of the rod's ends in a moving frame K, then Relativity\ndemands that the same events be not simultaneous in K0. Thus, we can mark one end now (at a\nmoment t1 ) and the other end later (at a moment t2 > t1 ) in K0, and then measure the distance\nbetween the marks. We can even consider such measurement as a possible operational definition\nof proper length. From the viewpoint of experimental physics, the requirement that the marks be\nmade simultaneously is redundant for a stationary object of constant shape and size, and it can in\nthis case be dropped. The distance between the ends of the stationary rod is its proper length\nregardless of the time lapse between the two markings. But this time lapse, together with the\nspatial separation l0, determines the 4-displacement between the two corresponding events (Fig.\n4). Since l0 is fixed while the time lapse is allowed to be arbitrary in K0, we have an infinite set\nof possible different 4-displacements with common spatial projection l0. In other words, the same\nproper length can be a spatial projection of an infinite number of different 4-vectors with\ndifferent temporal components and accordingly different norms. By the same token, it is not the\nproper distance between the marking events if the marks are not made simultaneously in K0.\nMoreover, we can make the time separation between the markings so big, that the corresponding\n4-displacement becomes light-like or even time-like! Consider a stationary rigid rod of 1 m\nproper length. In its rest frame, we mark its left end now and its right end one million years from\nnow. The 4-displacement between the markings is definitely time-like, in which case it cannot\neven be assigned a proper distance. There is no such thing as a proper distance for a time-like\n10\n\n\finterval! And yet we can measure the spatial distance between the marks and obtain exactly 1 m,\nwhich is, according to definition, the proper length of the rod. Thus, the proper length here is\nneither the proper distance (which does not exist for OC and OD in Fig. 4), nor the norm of the\ncorresponding 4-displacement, which is time-like!\nConsider now a reciprocal situation: let the rod move with velocity V along the x-axis of a\nreference frame K, with its length along the direction of motion. As before, we can measure the\nlength of the rod in K by marking its edges and then measuring the distance between the marks;\nbut now, since the rod is moving, it is absolutely imperative that the instant positions of the\nedges be marked simultaneously in K. In this case, the spatial separation r AB = l between the\nmarks is, by definition, the proper distance between the marking events; but it is not the proper\nlength of the rod! Indeed, the described procedure constitutes the length measurement of the\nmoving and accordingly Lorentz-contracted rod; the rod's proper length l0 (assuming its speed\nis known) is obtained from l as:\nl0 = \u03b3 (V ) l = \u03b3 (V ) rAB \u2260 r AB\n\n(22)\n\nAgain, the proper length here is not the norm of a 4-vector.\nThe non-trivial relationship between proper length and proper distance can be seen in more\ndetails from the space-time diagram of the moving rod (Fig. 5). The diagram shows the world\nsheet of such a rod, with segment\nOA = l = l0 / \u03b3 (V ) \u2261 xA\n(23)\nbeing its Lorentz-contracted length. The primed axes ct \u2032 and x\u2032 are now the temporal and\nspatial axes, respectively, of the RF K0 co-moving with the rod. Since events O and L happen at\nthe end points of the rod which is stationary in K0, the norm of the 4-displacement OL is equal to\nits proper length. Since these events are simultaneous in K0, the norm is also equal to the proper\ndistance between O and L. This is one of the few special cases when the proper length is\ncoincident with proper distance. But even in this case the Lorentz-contracted length OA, contrary\nto the cited statement from [22] is not the spatial projection of OL. Apart from being\nimmediately evident from Fig. 5, this can easily be proved quantitatively. Assume as usual that\nthe local clocks at the respective origins of both frames K and K0 read the zero time when they\nare instantly coincident (event O). Denoting the spatial projection of OL as OC \u2261 xL and the time\ncoordinate of event L in K as tL , we have\nxL = xA + V tL\n(24)\nLorentz-transformed time-coordinate of this event in K0 is\nV\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ntL\u2032 = \u03b3 (V ) \uf8ec tL \u2212 2 xL \uf8f7\nc\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nSince x\u2032 is the line of simultaneity in K0, we have tL\u2032 = 0 , which gives\n\n11\n\n(25)\n\n\ftL =\n\nV\nxL\nc2\n\n(26)\n\nPutting this into (24) and solving for xL yields, in view of (23)\nxL = \u03b3 (V ) l0\n\n(27)\n\nAs was already mentioned, not only is xL greater than l = xA , it is greater than l0.\nAs a by-product of this derivation we see that the proper length (represented by OB in K) is the\ngeometric mean of the Lorentz-contracted length and the spatial projection of 4-displacement\nOL. Thus, the spatial projection r12 of a proper distance r 12 is, as it should be in Lorentzian\ngeometry, greater than r 12 , and the Lorentz-contracted length is not a projection of the proper\nlength. The latter cannot be computed from l and t in the same way as (17).\nStrictly speaking, we cannot even claim that the relativistic length contraction is a purely\ngeometric effect. It is rather a combination of geometry and dynamics, which is especially\nevident when we consider length measurements of accelerated objects or objects of varying size\n[5, 26, 27].\nThus, the proper distance and the proper length describe quite different characteristics of a\nprocess or an object. The former relates to a pair of events in space-time, which are connected by\na space-like interval; the latter describes geometrical properties of a material object observed in\nits rest frame. It is not an invariant of category III (let alone I or II !). It could be named the\n\"conditional invariant\" merely by convention: when we measure the Lorentz-contracted length l\nof a moving object, we just remember in the back of our mind that the observer sitting on this\nobject would record the length l0. In other words, we mentally substitute the actual length l of the\nobject in a given RF by its length l0 in the co-moving RF. If we know V, we can compute l0 from\nl using (23), but this computation has nothing to do with those in Part III. If we apply\nconsistently the logics of described \"promotion\" (naming the \"invariant\" any characteristic of an\nobject in its rest frame) then nearly all physical quantities will become \"invariants\"; in which\ncase the mere concept of invariance will be stripped of its meaning. But once the proper length\nhas been universally acclaimed as an invariant, we must at least be very careful to separate it\nfrom true invariants of type I, II, and III, and put it into a separate category. Naming things as\nthey are, we should call this type the bogus invariant. More politely (until the proper length is\ndisqualified from its current status) we can call it conventional (or conditional) invariant.\n\nV.

Absolute invariant c (II) is directly measurable for an object in motion if\nm0 = 0 or computable as the norm of its 4-velocity in any state of motion (including rest) if\nm0 \u2260 0 . Rotational or norm-invariants (III) are directly measurable in a proper or rest frame of a\nsystem and computable as the norm of the corresponding 4-vector characterizing the system.\n\n13\n\n\fFigures\n\nm\n\nm0\n\u2206m05\n\u2206m5\n\u2206m4\n\u2206m03\n\n\u2206m04\n\u2206m3\n\n\u2206m02\n\n\u2206m2\n\n\u2206m01 \u2206m1\n\n0\n\np/c\n\nFig. 1\nThe invariant (rest) mass m0 of an object as the norm of its 4-momentum vector.\nThe vector is normalized to mass and shown here in the object's rest frame.

This is just a generalized version\nof the twin (or clock) paradox with one clock S stationary in K0 and the other one (T) making a\nround trip. The proper time \u03c4 AB (S) read by S is greater than the proper time \u03c4 AB (T) of T between\nthe events A and B. The net proper time \u03c4 AB (S) is the geometric (not algebraic!) sum of the\nproper times \u2206\u03c40j of individual stages of T's trip, or, which is the same, the algebraic sum of\ntheir projections (dilated times \u2206\u03c4j) onto the ct-axis.

The width of the sheet (the proper length l0) is the common spatial\nprojection of space-like 4-displacements OA and OB, light-like 4-displacement OC and time-like\n4-displacement OD. In case OA the corresponding 4-displacement is coincident with the proper\nlength. In neither case (except for OA) is the proper length equal to the norm of the\ncorresponding 4-displacement. In particular, the norm of OC is zero. And in neither case, except\nfor OA, is the proper length identical to proper distance even numerically, let alone conceptually.\nThus, 4-displacement OC has in the described case the proper length l0 as its spatial projection,\nbut no proper distance is associated with it (there is no RF in which the events O and C would be\nsimultaneous).
