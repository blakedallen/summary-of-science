Nanowires with widths, w = 250 nm to\n3 \u03bcm and a base thickness of t = 10 nm were fabricated by electron-beam lithography.

E.g. only in nanowires one encounters\nhead-to-head transverse (TDWs) or vortex domain walls (VDWs). The occurrence of which\ndepends on the nanowire width, w, and thickness, t [3-12]. A w-t-phase diagram for Permalloy\n(Ni81Fe19) nanowires has been explored both experimentally [9] and theoretically [5, 11]\nshowing the regions of existence of either TDWs or VDWs. Generally, narrow and thin wires\nexhibit TDWs, whereas wider and thicker wires show VDWs. Transformations between these\ntwo configurations were observed either upon heating [9] or by application of an electrical\n\na)\n\nCorresponding author: oleg.petracic@ruhr-uni-bochum.de\n\n\f2\ncurrent [10]. However, DW transformations triggered by the wire geometry are not well\nexplored.\nIn order to study the latter case, straight Permalloy (Py) nanowires with a thickness\ngradient along the wire axis have been prepared. We use electron beam lithography and\nsubsequent lift-off for fabrication. The metallization has been performed by UHV ion-beam\nsputtering from a Py target. The wires have widths in the range 250 nm \u2264 w \u2264 3 \u03bcm, a base\nthickness of t = 10 nm and a length of 90 \u03bcm with laterally tapered ends. The tapered ends\nhave the effect of eliminating unwanted end domains. Sets of identical wires but different\nlengths of thickness gradients 0 \u2264 lg \u2264 40 \u03bcm with a constant slope of \u22485\u22c510-4 have been\nfabricated using a penumbra shadow mask during metallization very close to the substrate\n[13]. The idea is to trigger a transformation of a DW from TDW to VDW type at the thickness\ngradient. Depending on whether a transformation occurs or not the remagnetization behavior\nof the wire will show different signatures.\nFigure 1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of a wire with w = 3 \u03bcm\nwithout a gradient (a) and a similar wire with a gradient (b). The gradients have an almost\nlinear thickness profile as found by atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies (not shown).\nMagnetometry measurements have been performed using a 'NanoMoke II' setup (Durham\nMagneto Optics) [14], where the longitudinal magneto-optic Kerr effect (LMOKE) signal of\nindividual nanowires can be recorded as function of the applied field.\nFigure 2 (a) shows example LMOKE hysteresis loops for wires with w = 250 nm without\ngradient (label 1) and with a gradient (label 2). In all cases we find square loops indicating\nmagnetization switching via DW nucleation and motion. Furthermore, one observes a strong\ndecrease of Hc upon introducing a thickness gradient. In detail, one finds for wires without a\ngradient Hc = 104, 78, 55, 31, 15 and 9 Oe for widths w = 250 nm, 350 nm, 530 nm, 800 nm,\n1.5 \u03bcm and 3.0 \u03bcm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 (b) [black circles, together with a linear\nfit]. The width dependence matches well with the expected linear behavior, Hc = c1 + c2 t/w,\n\n\f3\nwhere c1 \u221d Hc(w \u2192 \u221e) is a usually negligible constant and c2 \u221d Ms another constant\ndepending also on the specific wire shape [7, 12]. The Laser spot (diameter < 5 \u03bcm ) has been\nfocused onto the middle part of the wire. Corresponding wires with a gradient of length lg \u2248\n40 \u03bcm show reduced values, i.e., Hc = 28, 11, 8.4, 7.7, 4.7, and 3.0 Oe, respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 2 (b) [blue stars, the interpolating line is a guide to the eye]. Here the Laser spot has\nbeen focused onto the wire in a distance of \u224810 \u03bcm next to the left end of the wire. The two\ncurves Hc vs. t/w seem to converge with two different slopes for t/w \u2192 0 (increasing w). At\nt/w > 0.01 the slope of the curve flattens and a plateau or inflection point is visible at t/w \u2248\n0.017. For greater values, t/w > 0.02, the curve shows an increasing slope for t/w \u2192 \u221e\n(decreasing w).\nConsidering the w-t-phase diagram for Py nanowires [9] one expects a TDW-VDW\ntransition at w \u2248 450 nm for a base wire thickness, as in our case, of t = 10 nm and hence t/w \u2248\n0.022. This value matches relatively well with the inflection point of the curve. Obviously it\nmarks a crossover between two different regimes of domain wall propagation through the\ngradient. I.e., in the first regime for w < 450 nm (t/w > 0.022) it follows from the w-t-diagram\nand the relation Hc \u221d t/w that a TDW will nucleate in the thinnest part of the wire. Since it is\nexpected to stay a TDW even in the thick part, no transformation of the type of DW will occur\nand it will propagate unhindered through the entire wire. This is reflected in the slope of the\ncurve for large t/w which seem to approach the slope of the curve for wires without gradient.\nIn the second regime for w > 450 nm (t/w < 0.022) again a TDW is expected to nucleate in the\nthin part. However, during propagation over the thickness gradient it has to transform to a\nVDW. This transformation most probably occurs over an energy barrier thus inhibiting the\nDW propagation. This is reflected in the Hc vs. t/w curve as the part with reduced slope for t/w\n\u2192 0 compared to curve 1 of the wires without gradient. The range between the two regimes,\nt/w ~ 0.017, is most likely governed by a bifurcation between the two cases.\n\n\f4\nFurthermore, we performed micromagnetic simulations using OOMMF [15]. Fig. 3 shows\nHc vs. t/w for wires without a thickness gradient (label 1, squares) and with a gradient (label 2,\ndiamonds). The simulated wires had widths w = 50, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 nm and a\nbase thickness of t = 10 nm. The lengths have been set to l = 10\u22c5w and the cell size to [\u2206x, \u2206y,\n\u2206z] = [10, 10, 2.5] nm. Standard micromagnetic parameters for Py have been used, i.e., Ms =\n860 kA/m and A = 13 pJ/m. The gradient has been introduced by vertically tapering off the\n'filled' simulation cells over a fixed distance of 300 nm. Wires without a gradient show a\ncurve with linear behavior similar to the experimental case. One should note that the fields are\nlarger compared to the experiment probably due to the simulation being at T=0 and due to less\nnucleation seeds being present compared to real samples. The curve for wires with a gradient\ndisplays also a cross-over behavior similar to the one in the experiment although the plateau is\nnot as pronounced. One observes also an inflection point at t/w = 0.1 which corresponds to\nw = 100nm. This matches well with the theoretically expected TDW-VDW transition border\nat w = 150nm for t = 10nm [11]. Consequently the signature of a possible TDW-VDW\nbifurcation can be observed also in simulations.\nSurprisingly, however, the corresponding spin structures during simulation do not show\nany transition to a VDW configuration. Fig. 4 shows snapshots of the spin structure for a wire\nwith w = 400 nm and t = 10 nm. Starting initially at positive saturation the applied field is\ngradually decreased. At a negative field of H = -80 Oe one observes first nucleation and then\npropagation of a TDW, which stops at the first step of the gradient [Fig. 4 (b)]. (The lowest\nterrace is slightly longer compared to the other ones for more controlled nucleation of the\nDW.) At a field of H = -120 Oe the TDW depins from the step and becomes stretched and\ndeformed [Fig. 4 (c-d)]. No transition to a VDW can be observed for wires even with w =\n700 nm (not shown). Only in simulations of thicker wires with e.g. t = 18 nm vortex\nformation can be found [Fig. 4 (e)]. Hence, the inflection point in the Hc vs. t/w curves in Fig.\n2(b) and 3 does not correspond to a wall transformation.\n\n\f5\nWe rather assume that a metastability regime occurs for such values of w and t, where a\ntransformation from a TDW to VDW is expected energetically. However, the TDW state\nstays trapped by an activation barrier in a local energy minimum. This probably results in a\nreduced mobility of the DW at the gradient appearing in the Hc vs. t/w curve as an inflection\npoint [Fig. 2(b) and 3]. In contrast, the regime for small w (large t/w) is characterized by a\nlarger mobility since no transformation is expected. Consequently the Hc vs. t/w curve is\nmainly governed by the DW nucleation field and therefore by the dimensions and the shape of\nthe wire ends where the DWs nucleate. The same applies to wires without a gradient. The\nbehavior for large w (small t/w), however, remains unclear. The slope of the Hc vs. t/w curve\nis larger than in the plateau region, but less compared to the wires without gradient. This\ncould hint toward an extrapolated regime where DW transformation does occur, but where the\nmobility of the DW is increased compared to the plateau regime.\nIn summary, we have investigated the domain wall propagation in Permalloy nanowires\nwith a thickness gradient along the wire axis. The hysteresis loop of individual nanowires\nwith and without a thickness gradient of base thickness t =10 nm, widths 250 nm \u2264 w \u2264 3 \u03bcm\nand a length of 90 \u03bcm have been recorded by a MOKE setup. We find square loops indicating\nmagnetization switching via DW nucleation and motion. The coercivity Hc vs. t/w shows for\nwires without a gradient the expected linear behavior. For wires with a gradient the Hc values\nare reduced. The Hc vs. t/w curve shows a characteristic inflection point at those values of w,\nwhere a transformation from TDW to VDW type is expected. Corresponding micromagnetic\nsimulations, however, reveal that no transformation occurs. We assume that the inflection\npoint is rather due to a metastability regime with reduced mobility of the DW at the gradient.\nThe authors thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through SFB 491 and SFB 668\nfor financial support.\n\n\f6\nReferences:\n[1]\n\nD.A.
