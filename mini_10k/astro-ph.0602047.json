Introduction\nAstrophysicists distinguish between three different types of compact stellar objects. These are\nwhite dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The latter constitute a region of space which has so\nmuch mass\u2013energy concentrated in it that no particles (not even light) inside the black hole's event\nhorizon can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The situation is very different for neutron\nstars and white dwarfs, which are about as massive as the sun (mass M\u2299 = 2 \u00d7 1030 kg) but whose\nradii are much smaller than the sun's radius (R\u2299 = 7 \u00d7 105 km). Model calculations predict that\nthe matter in the cores of neutron stars is compressed to densities ranging from a few times the\ndensity of an atomic nucleus, 2.5 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 , to densities that may be ten to twenty times higher\n[1, 2, 3]. In comparison to that, white dwarfs of average mass, M \u223c 0.6 M\u2299 are at least by a factor\nof 107 less dense than neutron stars. The tremendous densities (and thus pressures) existing inside\nneutron stars make them superb astrophysical laboratories for a wide range of fascinating physical\nstudies [1, 2, 4]. These include the exploration of nuclear processes in an environment extremely\nrich of electrons and neutrons, and the formation of new states of matter, like quark matter which is\nbeing sought at the most powerful terrestrial particle colliders. If quark matter exists in the cores of\nneutron stars, it will be a color superconductor whose condensation pattern has been shown to be\nvery complex [5, 6, 7]. It has also been theorized that quark matter (known as strange quark matter)\nmay be even more stable than atomic nuclei. In the latter event neutron stars should be entirely\nmade of strange quark matter, possibly enveloped in a very thin nuclear crust. Such objects are\ncalled strange stars [8, 9, 10]. Strangeness, therefore, carried by hyperons, mesons, H-dibaryons,\nand strange quark matter, plays a key role for compact star physics and phenomenology, as will be\ndiscussed in this paper (see Ref. [4] for a detailed recent review on this topic).\n\n2. Composition of high-density neutron star matter and EoS\nThe properties of neutron stars are determined by the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star\nmatter. The EoS of neutron star matter below neutron drip, which occurs at densities around\n4 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 , and at densities above neutron drip but below the saturation density of nuclear\nmatter is relatively well known. This is to a less extent the case for the EoS in the vicinity of the\nsaturation density of normal nuclear matter, n0 = 0.16 fm\u22123 (energy density of \u03b50 = 140 MeV/fm3 ).\nFinally, the physical properties of matter at still higher densities are extremely uncertain so that the\nassociated EoS is only very poorly known [1, 2, 3]. This is graphically indicated by the hatched\nareas in Fig. 1, which is based on three Walecka-type models for the EoS. The HV model is a\nrelativistic non-linear mean-field equation of state computed for nucleons (N= n, p) and hyperons\n(H= \u03a3, \u039b, \u039e) in chemical equilibrium [4, 11]. The other two models, GB180\n300 [1] and CFL [12],\naccount additionally for the presence of up, down, and strange quarks in neutron star matter. The\nquarks are treated as normal unpaired quarks (Q) in the GB180\n300 model, and as color-flavor locked\nsuperconducting quarks (sQ) with a superfluid gap of \u2206 = 100 MeV in the CFL model. The model\nlabeled DD-RBHF is a density dependent relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock EoS which accounts\nfor nucleons and hyperons [13, 14]. It is obvious from Fig. 1 that, depending on stellar composition,\nneutron star properties such as masses, radii, moments of inertia, redshifts, or limiting rotational\nperiods may vary significantly with strangeness.\n2\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\n1000\nHV (N,H)\n\n,\u03bc\n\ns\n\n600\n\nn,\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\nk\nar\n\ns\n\np,\n\n3\n\nP (MeV/fm )\n\nCFL (N,H,sQ)\nDD-RBHF (N,H)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nP=\n\u03b5\n\n400\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\nB180\n\nG300 (N,H,Q)\n\n800\n\n\u03c0\n\n,K\n\n,\n,d\n\n,u\n\nL,\n\nqu\n\n(?\n\n)\n\nC\n2S\n\n(?\n\nCF\n\nl\nIdea\n\n200\n\nas\n\nron g\n\nneut\n\nToo little pressure\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n2000\n3\n\u03b5 (MeV/fm )\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nFigure 1: Models for the EoS of neutron star matter.\n\n2.1 Hyperons\nAt the densities in the interior of neutron stars, the neutron chemical potential, \u03bc n , is likely\nto exceeds the masses, modified by interactions, of \u03a3, \u039b and possibly \u039e hyperons [11]. Hence, in\naddition to nucleons, neutron star matter is expected to have significant populations of hyperons\nand possibly even \u2206's [15]. If so, pure neutron matter would constitute an excited state relative to\nhyperonic (many-baryon) matter which, therefore, would quickly transform via weak reactions like\nn \u2192 p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\n\n(2.1)\n\nto the lower energy state. The chemical potentials associated with reaction (2.1) in equilibrium\nobey the relation\n\u2212\n\u03bcn = \u03bc p + \u03bce ,\n(2.2)\nwhere \u03bc \u03bd\u0304e = 0 since the mean free path of (anti) neutrinos is much smaller than the radius of\nneutron stars. Hence (anti) neutrinos do not accumulate inside neutron stars. This is different for\nhot proto-neutron stars [16]. Equation (2.2) is a special case of the general relation\n\n\u03bc \u03c7 = B \u03c7 \u03bc n \u2212 q\u03c7 \u03bc e ,\n\u2212\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich holds in any system characterized by two conserved charges. These are in the case of neutron\nstar matter electric charge, q\u03c7 , and baryon number charge, B\u03c7 . Application of Eq. (2.3) to the \u039b\nhyperon (B\u039b = 1, q\u039b = 0), for instance, leads to\n\n\u03bc\u039b = \u03bcn .\n\n(2.4)\n\nIgnoring particle interactions, the chemical potential of a relativistic particle of type \u03c7 is given by\nq\n\u03bc \u03c7 = \u03c9 (kF\u03c7 ) \u2261 m2\u03c7 + kF2\u03c7 ,\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03c9 (kF\u03c7 ) is the single-particle energy of the particle and kF\u03c7 its Fermi momentum. Substituting\n(2.5) into (2.4) leads to\nq\nkF 3\n(2.6)\nkFn \u2265 m2\u039b \u2212 m2n \u2243 3 fm\u22121 \u21d2 n \u2261 n 2 \u2243 2n0 ,\n3\u03c0\n3\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nwhere m\u039b = 1116 MeV and mn = 939 MeV was used. That is, if interactions among the particles\nare ignored, neutrons are replaced with \u039b's in neutron star matter at densities as low as two times the\ndensity of nuclear matter. This result is only slightly altered by the inclusion of particle interactions\n[11]. Aside from chemical equilibrium, the condition of electric charge neutrality of neutron star\nmatter,\nq\u03c7 kF3\u03c7 + 3 \u03c0 2 nM \u0398(\u03bc M \u2212 mM ) \u2261 0 ,\n(2.7)\n\u2211\n\u03c7 =p,\u03a3\u00b1 ,\u039e\u2212 ,\u2206++ ,...;e\u2212 ,\u03bc \u2212\n\nwhere M stands for \u03c0 \u2212 or K \u2212 mesons, plays a key role for the particle composition of neutron\nstar matter too. The last term in (2.7) accounts for the possible existence of either a \u03c0 \u2212 or a\nK \u2212 meson condensate in neutron star matter, which will be discussed in more detail in Sect. 2.2\nbelow. Before, however, we illustrate the importance of Eqs. (2.2) and (2.7) for the proton-neutron\nfraction of neutron star matter. The beta decay and electron capture processes among nucleons, n \u2192\np+ e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e and p+ e\u2212 \u2192 n+ \u03bde respectively, also known as nucleon direct Urca processes, are only\npossible in neutron star matter if the proton fraction exceeds a certain critical value [17]. Otherwise\nenergy and momentum can not be conserved simultaneously for these reactions so that they are\nforbidden. For a neutron star made up of only nucleons and electrons, it is rather straightforward to\nshow that the critical proton fraction is around 11%. This follows from kFn = kFp + kFe combined\nwith the condition of electric charge neutrality of neutron star matter. The triangle inequality then\nrequires for the magnitudes of the particle Fermi momenta kFn \u2264 kFp + kFe , and charge neutrality\ndictates that kFp = kFe . Substituting kFp = kFe into the triangle inequality leads to kFn \u2264 2kFp so\nthat for the particle number densities of neutrons and protons nn \u2264 8n p . Expressed as a fraction\nof the system's total baryon number density, n \u2261 n p + nn , one thus arrives at n p /n > 1/9 \u2243 0.11,\nwhich is the figure quoted just above. Medium effects and interactions among the particles modify\nthis value only slightly but the presence of muons raises it to about 0.15. Hyperons, which may\nexist in neutron star matter rather abundantly, produce neutrinos via direct Urca processes like\n\u03a3\u2212 \u2192 \u039b + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e and \u039b + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a3\u2212 + \u03bde [18]. The direct Urca processes are of key importance for\nneutron star cooling, which will be discussed briefly in Sect. 6. In most cases, the nucleon direct\nUrca process is more efficient than the ones involving hyperons [19, 20].\n2.2 Meson condensates\nThe pion or kaon meson fields may develop condensates in dense neutron star matter. These\ncondensates would have two important effects on neutron stars. Firstly, they would soften the EoS\nabove the critical density for onset of condensation, which reduces the maximum neutron star mass.\nSecondly, since the < \u03c0 \u2212 > or <K \u2212 > condensates can absorb as little or as much momentum as\nrequired by the scattering processes n+ < \u03c0 \u2212 >\u2192 n + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e or n+ <K \u2212 >\u2192 n + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e , the\nassociated neutrino emissivities are very high which leads to fast neutron star cooling [20, 21]\n(see Sect. 6). Since the K \u2212 condensate process involves a change in strangeness, it is roughly\nby a factor sin2 \u03b8C \u2243 1/20 (\u03b8C denotes the Cabibbo angle) less efficient than the \u03c0 \u2212 condensate\nprocess. However, medium effects can reduce the impact of the \u03c0 \u2212 condensate on stellar cooling\nby about one order of magnitude, making it comparable to the efficiency of the K \u2212 condensate.\nEstimates predict the onset of \u03c0 \u2212 condensation at densities around n\u03c0 \u223c 2n0 , with n0 = 0.16 fm\u22123\nthe empirical nuclear matter density. However, this density is very sensitive to the strength of the\neffective nucleon particle-hole repulsion in the isospin T = 1, spin S = 1 channel, which tends to\n4\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nsuppress \u03c0 \u2212 condensation and may push n\u03c0 to much higher values. Similarly, depending on the\nnuclear model, the threshold density for the onset of K \u2212 condensation, nK , is probably at least as\nhigh as 4n0 [22, 23].\nK \u2212 condensation can only occur in neutron star matter if the electron chemical potential equals\nthe effective in-medium meson mass, according to the schematic reaction e\u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 + \u03bde , with the\nneutrinos leaving the star (see Fig. 2).

The relatively isospin symmetric composition achieved in this way resembles\nthe one of isospin symmetric atomic nuclei, which are made up of equal numbers of neutrons and\nprotons. Neutron star matter is therefore referred to in this picture as nucleon matter, and neutron\nstars constructed for such an EoS are referred to as nucleon stars [25, 26, 27, 28].\n2.3 H-dibaryons\nA novel particle that could make its appearance in the center of a neutron star is the so-called\nH-dibaryon, a doubly strange six-quark composite with spin and isospin zero, and baryon number\ntwo [29]. Since its first prediction in the 1970s, the H-dibaryon has been the subject of many\ntheoretical and experimental studies as a possible candidate for a strongly bound exotic state. In\nneutron stars, which may contain a significant fraction of \u039b hyperons, the \u039b's could combine\nto form H-dibaryons, which could give way to the formation of H-dibaryon matter at densities\nsomewhere above \u223c 3 \u03b50 [30, 31, 32] depending on the in-medium properties of the H-dibaryon.\nFor an attractive optical potential, UH , of the H-dibaryon at normal nuclear density the equation\nof state is softened considerably, as shown in Fig. 3. H-dibaryon matter could thus exist in the\ncores of moderately dense neutron stars.

Conversely, if the medium potential were\nmoderately repulsive, around UH = +30 MeV, the formation of H-dibaryons may only take place in\nheavier neutron stars of masses greater than about 1.6 M\u2299 . If formed, however, H-matter may not\nremain dormant in neutron stars but, because of its instability against compression, could trigger\nthe conversion of neutron stars into hypothetical strange stars [31, 33, 34].\n2.4 Quark deconfinement\nOne item that came recently into particular focus concerns the possible existence of quark\nmatter in the cores of neutron stars [2, 5, 6]. The phase transition from confined hadronic matter to\ndeconfined quark matter is characterized by the conservation of baryon charge and electric charge.\nThe Gibbs condition for phase equilibrium then is that the two associated chemical potentials, \u03bc n\nand \u03bc e , and the pressure in the two phases be equal [1, 35],\nPH (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , {\u03c7 }, T ) = PQ (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) .\n\n(2.8)\n\nPH denoted the pressure of hadronic matter computed for a given hadronic matter Lagrangian\nLM ({\u03c7 }), where {\u03c7 } denotes the field variables and Fermi momenta that characterize a solution\nto the field equations of confined hadronic matter,\n(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m\u03c7 )\u03c8\u03c7 (x) =\n(\u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + m\u03c32 )\u03c3 (x) =\n\n\u2211\n\n\u0393M \u03c7 M(x) \u03c8\u03c7 (x) ,\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u2211\n\n\u0393\u03c3 \u03c7 \u03c8\u0304\u03c7 (x)\u03c8\u03c7 (x) ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nM=\u03c3 ,\u03c9 ,\u03c0 ,...\n\n\u03c7 =p,n,\u03a3,...\n\nplus additional equations for the other meson fields (M = \u03c9 , \u03c0 , \u03c1 , ...).

The first one is given by\nn\u2261\n\nA\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b7 ) nH (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) + \u03b7 nQ (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) ,\nV\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u2261 VQ /V denotes the volume proportion of quark matter, VQ , in the unknown volume V , and\nnH and nQ are the baryon number densities of hadronic matter and quark matter. Global neutrality\nof electric charge within the volume V can be written as\n0=\n\nQ\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b7 ) qH (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) + \u03b7 qQ (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) + qL ,\nV\n\n(2.13)\n\nwith qi the electric charge densities of hadrons, quarks, and leptons. For a given temperature, T ,\nEqs. (2.8) to (2.13) serve to determine the two independent chemical potentials and the volume\nV for a specified volume fraction \u03b7 of the quark phase in equilibrium with the hadronic phase.\nAfter completion VQ is obtained as VQ = \u03b7 V . Because of Eqs. (2.8) through (2.13) the chemical\npotentials depend on the proportion \u03b7 of the phases in equilibrium, and hence so also all properties\nthat depend on them, i.e. the energy densities, baryon and charge densities of each phase, and\nthe common pressure. For the mixed phase, the volume proportion of quark matter varies from\n0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1 and the energy density is the linear combination of the two phases [1, 35],\n\n\u03b5 = (1 \u2212 \u03b7 ) \u03b5H (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , {\u03c7 }, T ) + \u03b7 \u03b5Q (\u03bc n , \u03bc e , T ) .\n\n(2.14)\n\nHypothetical neutron star compositions computed along the lines described above are shown in\nFig. 4. Possible astrophysical signals originating from quark deconfinement will be discussed in\nSect. 5 [1, 2, 36, 37].\n7\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\n2.5 Color superconductivity of quark matter\nThere has been much recent progress in our understanding of quark matter, culminating in the\ndiscovery that if quark matter exists it ought to be in a color superconducting state [5, 6, 38, 39].\nThis is made possible by the strong interaction among the quarks which is very attractive in some\nchannels. Pairs of quarks are thus expected to form Cooper pairs very readily. Since pairs of quarks\ncannot be color neutral, the resulting condensate will break the local color symmetry and form what\nis called a color superconductor. The phase diagram of such matter is expected to be very complex\n[5, 6]. This is caused by the fact that quarks come in three different colors, different flavors, and\ndifferent masses. Moreover, bulk matter is neutral with respect to both electric and color charge,\nand is in chemical equilibrium under the weak interaction processes that turn one quark flavor into\nanother. To illustrate the condensation pattern briefly, we note the following pairing ansatz for the\nquark condensate [40],\n\u03b2\n\nh\u03c8 \u03b1fa C\u03b35 \u03c8 fb i \u223c \u22061 \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 1 \u03b5 fa fb 1 + \u22062 \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 2 \u03b5 fa fb 2 + \u22063 \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 3 \u03b5 fa fb 3 ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere \u03c8 \u03b1fa is a quark of color \u03b1 = (r, g, b) and flavor fa = (u, d, s), and \u03b5i jk denotes the Levi-Civita\nsymbol. The latter is zero for i = j, j = k , or k = i; +1 for (i, j, k) an even permutation of (1,2,3);\nand \u22121 for (i, j, k) an odd permutation of (1,2,3). The condensate is a Lorentz scalar, antisymmetric\nin Dirac indices, antisymmetric in color, and thus antisymmetric in flavor. The gap parameters\n\u22061 , \u22062 and \u22063 describe d-s, u-s and u-d quark Cooper pairs, respectively. The following pairing\nschemes have emerged. At asymptotic densities (ms \u2192 0 or \u03bc \u2192 \u221e) the ground state of QCD with\na vanishing strange quark mass is the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase (color-flavor locked quark\npairing), in which all three quark flavors participate symmetrically. The gaps associated with this\nphase are\n\u22063 \u2243 \u22062 = \u22061 = \u2206 ,\n(2.16)\nand the quark condensates of the CFL phase are approximately of the form\n\u03b2\n\nh\u03c8 \u03b1fa C\u03b35 \u03c8 fb i \u223c \u2206 \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 X \u03b5 fa fb X ,\n\n(2.17)\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\nwith color and flavor indices all running from 1 to 3. Since \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 X \u03b5 fa fb X = \u03b4 f\u03b1a \u03b4 fb \u2212 \u03b4 f\u03b1b \u03b4 fa one sees\nthat the condensate (2.17) involves Kronecker delta functions that link color and flavor indices.\nHence the notion color-flavor locking. The CFL phase has been shown to be electrically neutral\nwithout any need for electrons for a significant range of chemical potentials and strange quark\nmasses [41]. If the strange quark mass is heavy enough to be ignored, then up and down quarks\nmay pair in the two-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase. Other possible condensation patterns\nare CFL-K 0 [42], CFL-K + and CFL-\u03c0 0,\u2212 [43], gCFL (gapless CFL phase) [40], 1SC (singleflavor-pairing) [40, 44, 45], CSL (color-spin locked phase) [46], and the LOFF (crystalline pairing)\n[47, 48, 49] phase, depending on ms , \u03bc , and electric charge density. Calculations performed for\nmassless up and down quarks and a very heavy strange quark mass (ms \u2192 \u221e) agree that the quarks\nprefer to pair in the two-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase where\n\u22063 > 0 ,\n\n\u22062 = \u22061 = 0 .\n\nand\n\n(2.18)\n\nIn this case the pairing ansatz (2.15) reduces to\n\u03b2\n\nh\u03c8 \u03b1fa C\u03b35 \u03c8 fb i \u221d \u2206 \u03b5ab \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 3 .\n8\n\n(2.19)\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nHere the resulting condensate picks a color direction (3 or blue in the example (2.19) above), and\ncreates a gap \u2206 at the Fermi surfaces of quarks with the other two out of three colors (red and\ngreen). The gapless CFL phase (gCFL) may prevail over the CFL and 2SC phases at intermediate\nvalues of m2s /\u03bc with gaps given obeying the relation\n\u22063 > \u22062 > \u22061 > 0 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nFor chemical potentials that are of astrophysical interest, \u03bc < 1000 MeV, the gap is between 50 and\n100 MeV. The order of magnitude of this result agrees with calculations based on phenomenological effective interactions [39, 50] as well as with perturbative calculations for \u03bc > 10 GeV [51].\nWe also note that superconductivity modifies the equation of state at the order of (\u2206/\u03bc )2 [12, 52],\nwhich is even for such large gaps only a few percent of the bulk energy. Such small effects may\nbe safely neglected in present determinations of models for the equation of state of quark-hybrid\nstars. There has been much recent work on how color superconductivity in neutron stars could\naffect their properties (see Refs. [5, 6, 47, 53, 54, 55] and references therein). These studies reveal\nthat possible signatures include the cooling by neutrino emission, the pattern of the arrival times\nof supernova neutrinos, the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields, rotational stellar instabilities,\nand glitches in rotation frequencies.\nAside from neutron star properties, an additional test of color superconductivity may be provided by upcoming cosmic ray space experiments such as AMS [56] and ECCO [57].1 As shown\nin Ref. [58], finite lumps of color-flavor locked strange quark matter (see Sect. 2.6), which should\nbe present in cosmic rays if strange matter is the ground state of the strong interaction, turn out\nto be significantly more stable than strangelets without color-flavor locking for wide ranges of\nparameters. In addition, strangelets made of CFL strange matter obey a charge-mass relation of\nZ/A \u221d A\u22121/3 , which differs significantly from the charge-mass relation of strangelets made of ordinary strange quark matter. In the latter case, Z/A would be constant for small baryon numbers A\nand Z/A \u221d A\u22122/3 for large A [10, 58, 59]. This difference may allow an experimental test of CFL\nlocking in strange quark matter [58].\n2.6 Absolute stability of strange quark matter\nSo far we have assumed that quark matter forms a state of matter higher in energy than atomic\nnuclei. This most plausible assumption, however, may not be correct [60, 61, 62], since for a\ncollection of more than a few hundred u, d, s quarks, the energy per baryon, E/A, of quark matter\ncan be just as well below the energy per baryon of the most stable atomic nuclei, nickel and iron.\nThis is known as the strange quark matter hypothesis. The energy per baryon in 56 Fe, for instance,\nis given by M(56 Fe)c2 /56 = 930.4 MeV, with M(56 Fe) the mass of the 56 Fe atom. A simple\nestimate shows that for strange quark matter described by the MIT bag model E/A = 4B\u03c0 2 /\u03bc 3 ,\nso that bag constants of B = 57 MeV/fm3 (i.e. B1/4 = 145 MeV) and B = 85 MeV/fm3 (B1/4 =\n160 MeV) would place the energy per baryon of strange quark matter at E/A = 829 MeV and\n915 MeV, respectively, which correspond to strange quark matter which is absolutely bound with\nrespect to nuclear matter [10]. If this were indeed the case, neutron star matter would be metastable\nwith respect to strange quark matter, and all neutron stars should in fact be strange quark stars\n1 See\n\nJ.

The maximal possible nuclear matter\ndensity is determined by neutron drip which occurs at \u03b5crust = 0.24 MeV/fm3 (4.3 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 ). Any\nnuclear density that is smaller than that is possible. As an example, we show here the EoS for a chosen\ndensity of \u03b5crust = 10\u22124 MeV/fm3 (108 g/cm3 ).\n\n[10, 63, 64]. As outlined just above, strange quark matter is expected to be a color superconductor\nwhich, at extremely high densities, should be in the CFL phase. This phase is rigorously electrically\nneutral with no electrons required [41]. For sufficiently large strange quark masses, however, the\nlow density regime of strange quark matter is rather expected to form a 2SC phase (or possibly other\nphases) in which electrons are present [5, 6]. The presence of electrons causes the formation of an\nelectric dipole layer on the surface of strange matter, which enables strange quark matter stars to\ncarry crusts made of ordinary nuclear matter [8, 9, 65]. The maximal possible density at the base of\nthe crust (inner crust density) is determined by neutron drip, which occurs at about 4 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 .\nThis somewhat complicated situation of the structure of strange matter enveloped in a (chemically\nequilibrated) nuclear crust can be represented by a proper choice for the EoS which consists of\ntwo parts [66]. At densities below neutron drip it can be represented by the EoS of Baym-PethickSutherland, while the high-density part, consisting of strange quark matter, can be described by\nthe bag model EoS (see Fig. 5). The EoS is characterized by a significant discontinuity in density\nbetween strange quark matter and nuclear crust matter across the electric dipole gap where the\npressure of the nuclear crust at its base equals the pressure of strange matter at its surface [2, 4, 66].\nOne crucial astrophysical test of the strange quark matter hypothesis is whether strange quark\nstars can give rise to the observed phenomena of pulsar glitches. In the crust quake model an oblate\nsolid nuclear crust in its present shape slowly comes out of equilibrium with the forces acting on it\nas the rotational period changes, and fractures when the built up stress exceeds the sheer strength\nof the crust material. The period and rate of change of period slowly heal to the trend preceding\nthe glitch as the coupling between crust and core re-establish their co-rotation. The existence of\nglitches may have a decisive impact on the question of whether the strange quark matter hypothesis\nholds or not. From the calculations in [66] it is known that the ratio of the crustal moment of inertia\n10\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nto the star's total moment of inertia, Icrust /Itotal , varies between 10\u22123 and 10\u22125 at the maximum\nmass. If the angular momentum of the pulsar is conserved in the quake then the relative frequency\nchange and moment of inertia change are equal and one arrives at [66]\n\u2206\u03a9\n|\u2206I|\n|\u2206I|\nIcrust\n=\n>\n\u2261 f\n\u223c (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22123 ) f , with\n\u03a9\nI0\nI\nI\n\n0< f <1.\n\n(2.21)\n\nHere I0 denotes the moment of inertia of that part of the star whose frequency is changed in the\nquake. It might be that of the crust only, some fraction, or all of the star. The factor f in Eq.\n(2.21) represents the fraction of the crustal moment of inertia that is altered in the quake, i.e., f \u2261\n|\u2206I|/Icrust . Since the observed glitches have relative frequency changes \u2206\u03a9/\u03a9 = (10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126 ),\na change in the crustal moment of inertia of f <\n\u223c 0.1 would cause a giant glitch even in the least\nfavorable case [66]. Moreover, one finds that the observed range of the fractional change in the\nspin-down rate, \u03a9\u0307, is consistent with the crust having the small moment of inertia calculated and\nthe quake involving only a small fraction f of that, just as in Eq.

[67]. In addition to the electrostatic forces described above, this study includes\ngravity too. The properties of the gap are investigated for a wide range of parameters assuming both\ncolor-flavor locked and noncolor-flavor locked strange star cores. It is found that the maximally\nallowed inner crust density is generally lower than that of neutron drip. This does not alter the\noverall form of the EoS shown in Fig. 5, however. Another interesting finding concerning the\nsurface properties of strange stars was recently published in Ref. [68]. In this paper it is found that,\ndepending on the surface tension of nuggets of strange matter, a heterogeneous crust comprised\nof nuggets of strange quark matter embedded in an uniform electron background may exist in the\nsurface region of strange stars. This heterogeneous strange star surface would have a negligible\nelectric field which would make the existence of an ordinary nuclear crust, which requires a very\nstrong electric field, impossible.\n\n3. Models of compact stars\nNeutron stars are objects of highly compressed matter so that the geometry of space-time\nis changed considerably from flat space. Thus models of such stars are to be constructed in the\nframework of Einstein's general theory of relativity combined with theories of superdense matter.\nThe effects of curved space-time are included by coupling the energy-momentum density tensor\nfor matter fields to Einstein's field equations. The generally covariant Lagrangian density is\nL = LE + LG ,\n11\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nwhere the dynamics of particles is introduced through the matter Lagrangian LM added to the\ngravitational Lagrangian LG .

The quantities g\u03bc\u03bd and R in (3.5) denote the metric tensor\nand the Ricci scalar (scalar curvature) [2]. The tensor T \u03bc\u03bd contains the equation of state, P(\u03b5 ),\nof the stellar matter discussed in Sect. 2. In general, Einstein's field equations and the many-body\nequations were to be solved simultaneously since the baryons and quarks move in curved spacetime whose geometry, determined by Einstein's field equations, is coupled to the total mass energy\ndensity of the matter. In the case of neutron stars, as for all astrophysical situations for which the\nlong-range gravitational forces can be cleanly separated from the short-range forces, the deviation\nfrom flat space-time over the length scale of the strong interaction, \u223c 1 fm, is however practically\nzero up to the highest densities reached in the cores of such stars (some 1015 g/cm3 ). This is not\nto be confused with the global length scale of neutron stars, \u223c 10 km, for which M/R \u223c 0.3, depending on the star's mass. That is to say, gravity curves space-time only on a macroscopic length\nscale but leaves it flat to a very good approximation on a microscopic length scale. To achieve an\nappreciable curvature on a microscopic scale set by the strong interaction, mass densities greater\nthan \u223c 1040 g/cm3 would be necessary [69]! This circumstance divides the construction of models\nof compact stars into two distinct problems. Firstly, the effects of the short-range nuclear forces on\nthe properties of matter are described in a comoving proper reference frame (local inertial frame),\nwhere space-time is flat, by the parameters and laws of special relativistic many-body physics.\nSecondly, the coupling between the long-range gravitational field and the matter is then taken into\naccount by solving Einstein's field equations for the gravitational field described by the general relativistic curvature of space-time, which determines the global structure of the stellar configuration.\nFor many studies of neutron star properties it is sufficient to treat neutron star matter as a\nperfect fluid.

The boundary condition to (3.10) is P(r = 0) = P(\u03b5c ), where \u03b5c\ndenotes the energy density at the star's center, which constitutes a parameter. Equation (3.10) is to\nbe integrated out to a radial distance where P(r) = 0 which determines the star's radius, R.

Figure 6 shows the mass-radius\nrelationships of both non-rotating as well as rotating sequences of neutron stars for the sample\n13\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nEoSs discussed in Sect. 2. The non-rotating sequences are solutions of the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013\nVolkoff equation shown in (3.10). The construction of rotating sequences will be discussed shortly\nbelow.

Knowledge of the maximum possible mass of neutron stars is of\ngreat importance for two reasons. Firstly, because the largest known neutron star mass imposes a\nlower bound on the maximum mass of a theoretical model. Very massive neutron star candidates\n+0.4\nare J0751+1807 (2.1\u22120.5\nM\u2299 [72]), Vela X\u20131 (1.88 \u00b1 0.13 M\u2299 if the inclination angle of the system\nis i = 90o ; an inclination angle of i = 70o increases the star's mass to 2.27 \u00b1 0.17 M\u2299 [73]), and\nCyg X-2 (1.78 \u00b1 0.23 M\u2299 [74]. Titarchuck and Shaposhnikov obtain for Cyg X\u20132 a lower mass of\n1.44 \u00b1 0.06 M\u2299 [75]). The second reason is that the maximum mass of neutron stars is essential in\norder to identify solar-mass black hole candidates [76, 77].\nThe structure equations of rotating compact stars are considerably more complicated that those\nof non-rotating compact stars [2]. These complications have their cause in the rotational deformation, that is, a flattening at the pole accompanied with a radial blowup in the equatorial direction,\nwhich leads to a dependence of the star's metric on the polar coordinate, \u03b8 , in addition to the\nmere dependence on the radial coordinate, r. Secondly, rotation stabilizes a star against gravitational collapse. A rotating star can therefore carry more mass than a non-rotating star. Being\nmore massive, however, means that the geometry of space-time is changed too.

The frequency \u03c9\u0304 is defined in Eq. (3.13).\n\nmetric functions associated with a rotating star depend on the star's rotational frequency. Finally,\nthe general relativistic effect of the dragging of local inertial frames implies the occurrence of an\nadditional non-diagonal term, gt \u03c6 , in the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd . This term imposes a self-consistency\ncondition on the stellar structure equations, since the extent to which the local inertial frames are\ndragged along by the star is determined by the initially unknown stellar properties like mass and\nlimiting rotational frequency. The covariant components of the metric tensor of a rotating compact\nstar are thus given by [2, 78]\ngtt = \u2212e2 \u03bd + e2 \u03c8 \u03c9 2 , gt \u03c6 = \u2212e2 \u03c8 \u03c9 , grr = e2 \u03bb , g\u03b8 \u03b8 = e2 \u03bc , g\u03c6 \u03c6 = e2 \u03c8 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhich leads for the line element to\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u2212 e2 \u03bd dt 2 + e2 \u03c8 d \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c9 dt\n\n\u00012\n\n+ e2 \u03bc d \u03b8 2 + e2 \u03bb dr2 .\n\n(3.12)\n\nHere each metric function, i.e. \u03bd , \u03c8 , \u03bc and \u03bb , as well as the angular velocities of the local inertial\nframes, \u03c9 , depend on the radial coordinate r and polar angle \u03b8 and implicitly on the star's angular\nvelocity \u03a9. Of particular interest is the relative angular frame dragging frequency, \u03c9\u0304 , defined as\n\n\u03c9\u0304 (r, \u03b8 , \u03a9) \u2261 \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9 (r, \u03b8 , \u03a9) ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich is the angular velocity of the star, \u03a9, relative to the angular velocity of a local inertial frame,\n\u03c9 . It is this frequency that is of relevance when discussing the rotational flow of the fluid inside the\nstar, since the magnitude of the centrifugal force acting on a fluid element is governed\u2013in general\nrelativity as well as in Newtonian gravitational theory\u2013by the rate of rotation of the fluid element\nrelative to a local inertial frame [79]. In contrast to Newtonian theory, however, the inertial frames\ninside (and outside) a general relativistic fluid are not at rest with respect to the distant stars, as\npointed out just above. Rather, the local inertial frames are dragged along by the rotating fluid.\nDepending on the internal stellar constitution, this effect can be quite strong, as shown in Fig. 8 for\n15\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nTable 1: Properties of neutron stars composed of nucleons and hyperons (HV), nucleons, hyperons, and\nnormal quarks (GB180\n300 ), and nucleons, hyperons, and color-superconducting quarks (CFL).\n\n\u03b5c (MeV/fm3 )\nI (km3 )\nM (M\u2299 )\nR (km)\nZp\nZF\nZB\ngs,14 (cm/s2 )\nT /W\nBE (M\u2299 )\nVeq /c\n\nHV\n\u03bd =0\n\nGB180\n300\n\u03bd =0\n\nCFL\n\u03bdK = 0\n\nHV\n\u03bdK = 850 Hz\n\nGB180\n300\n\u03bdK = 940 Hz\n\nCFL\n\u03bdK = 1400 Hz\n\n361.0\n0\n1.39\n14.1\n0.1889\n0.1889\n0.1889\n1.1086\n0\n0.0937\n0\n\n814.3\n0\n1.40\n12.2\n0.2322\n0.2322\n0.2322\n1.5447\n0\n0.1470\n0\n\n2300.0\n0\n1.36\n9.0\n0.3356\n0.3356\n0.3356\n3.0146\n0\n0.1534\n0\n\n280.0\n223.6\n1.39\n17.1\n0.2374\n\u22120.1788\n0.6046\n0.7278\n0.0894\n0.0524\n0.336\n\n400.0\n217.1\n1.40\n16.0\n0.2646\n\u22120.1817\n0.6502\n0.8487\n0.0941\n0.1097\n0.353\n\n1100.0\n131.8\n1.41\n12.6\n0.3618\n\u22120.2184\n0.9190\n1.4493\n0.0787\n0.1203\n0.424\n\nrotating 2 ms neutron stars. For a very compact neutron star containing a color-superconducting\nCFL core, as in our example, one reads off from this figure that the local inertial frames at the star's\ncenter rotate at about half the star's rotational frequency, \u03c9 (r = 0) \u2243 \u03a9/2. This value drops to\nabout 15% for the local inertial frames located at the star's equator. The scenarios shown in Fig.\n8 may be of great importance for binary millisecond neutron stars in their final accretion stages,\nwhere the accretion disk approaches the star very closely.\nTable 1 summarizes the impact of strangeness on several intriguing properties of non-rotating\nas well as rotating neutron stars. The latter spin at their respective Kepler frequencies. One sees\nthat the central energy density, \u03b5c , spans a very wide range, depending on particle composition.\nThe surface redshift is of importance since it is connected to observed neutron star temperatures\nthrough the relation T \u221e /Teff = 1/(1 + Z). CFL quark stars may have redshifts that are up to 50%\nhigher than those of conventional stars. Finally, we also show in Table 1 the surface gravity of\nstars, gs,14 [80], which again may be up to 50% higher for CFL stars. The other quantities listed are\nthe rotational kinetic energy in units of the total energy of the star, T /W , the stellar binding energy,\nBE, and the rotational velocity of a particle at the star's equator [2].\n\n4. Limiting rotational periods\n4.1 Mass shedding from the equator\nNo simple stability criteria are known for rapidly rotating stellar configurations in general\nrelativity. However, an absolute limit on rapid rotation is set by the onset of mass shedding from\nthe equator of a rotating star. The corresponding rotational frequency is known as the Kepler\nfrequency, \u03a9K . In classical mechanics, the expression for the Kepler frequency, determined by the\np\nequality between the centrifugal force and gravity, is readily obtained as \u03a9K = M/R3 .

One exception to this are strange quark matter stars. These are self-bound\nand, thus, tend to possess smaller radii than conventional neutron stars, which are bound by gravity\nonly. Because of their smaller radii, strange stars can withstand mass shedding down to periods of\naround 0.5 ms [66, 81]. CFL stars reside between these limits.\n17\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\n1.0\nmass shedding limit\n\nshear viscosity\ndominates\n\n\u03a9c/\u03a9max\n\n\u03a9 c / \u03a9 max\n\nf\u2212mode instability\n\nbulk\nviscosity\n\nr\u2212mode instability\n(effects of hyperon\nviscosity included)\n\n0.5\n\ndominates\n(m=2) r\u2212mode instability\n\n0.0\n9\n10\nT(K)\n\n10\n\n10\nT(K)\n\n10\n\n11\n\nFigure 10: Temperature dependence of the critical angular velocity \u03a9c of rotating neutron stars.

(Data from Refs. [82, 83].)\n\nAs a last topic of this section, we briefly discuss the moment of inertia of a rotationally deformed star described by the metric in Eq. (3.12). For such stars the moment of inertia is given\nby\nI(\u03a9) = 2 \u03c0\n\nZ \u03c0\n0\n\nd\u03b8\n\nZ R(\u03b8 )\n\ndr e\u03bb +\u03bc +\u03bd +\u03c8\n\n0\n\n\u03a9\u2212\u03c9\n\u03b5 + P(\u03b5 )\n.\ne2\u03bd \u22122\u03c8 \u2212 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)2 \u03a9\n\n(4.5)\n\nFigure 9 shows that the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia of a neutron star may be around\n50% smaller if the star contains a very soft phase of matter like quark matter. This may be of\nrelevance for pulsar glitch models and the modeling of the post-glitch behavior of pulsars.\n4.2 Gravitational radiation reaction driven instabilities\nRotational instabilities in rotating stars, known as gravitational radiation driven instabilities,\nare probably setting a more stringent limit on rapid stellar rotation than mass shedding. These\ninstabilities originate from counter-rotating surface vibrational modes which at sufficiently high\nrotational star frequencies are dragged forward. In this case gravitational radiation, which inevitably accompanies the aspherical transport of matter, does not damp the instability modes but\nrather drives them. Viscosity plays the important role of damping these instabilities at a sufficiently\nreduced rotational frequency such that the viscous damping rate and power in gravity waves are\ncomparable. The most critical instability modes that are driven unstable by gravitational radiation\nare f -modes and r-modes. Figure 10 shows the stable neutron star frequencies if only f -modes\nwere operative. One sees that hot as well as cold neutron stars can rotate at frequencies close to\nmass shedding, because of the large contributions of shear and bulk viscosity, respectively, for this\ntemperature regime. The more recently discovered r-mode instability may change the picture completely, as can be seen too from Fig. 10. These modes are driven unstable by gravitational radiation\nover a considerably wider range of angular velocities than the f -modes (cf. dashed curve labeled\n(m = 2) r-mode instability). In stars with cores cooler than \u223c 109 K, on the other hand, the r-mode\ninstability may be completely suppressed by viscous phenomena so that stable rotation would be\nlimited by the f -mode instability again [82].\n18\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nFigure 11: Critical rotation frequencies versus\nstellar temperature for CFL strange stars [85].\n\nFigure 12: Same as Fig. 11, but for 2SC quark\nstars [85].\n\nFigures 11 and 12 are the counterparts to Fig. 10 but calculated for strange stars made of\nCFL and 2SC quark matter, respectively [84, 85]. The r-mode instability seems to rule out that\npulsars are CFL strange stars, if the characteristic time scale for viscous damping of r-modes are\nexponentially increased by factors of \u223c \u2206/T as calculated in [84]. An energy gap as small as \u2206 =\n1 MeV was assumed. For much larger gaps of \u2206 \u223c 100 MeV, as expected for color superconducting\nquark matter in the CFL phase, the entire diagram would be r-mode unstable. The full curve in Fig.\n11 is calculated for a strange quark mass of ms = 200 MeV, the dotted curve for ms = 100 MeV. The\nbox marks the positions of most low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) [86], and the crosses denote\nthe most rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars known. All strange stars above the curves would\nspin down on a time scale of hours due to the r-mode instability, in complete contradiction to the\nobservation of millisecond pulsars and LMXBs, which would rule out CFL quark matter in strange\nstars (see, however, Ref. [87]). Figure 12 shows the critical rotation frequencies of quark stars as\na function of internal stellar temperature for 2SC quark stars. For such quark stars the situation is\nless conclusive. Rapid spin-down, driven by the r-mode gravitational radiation instability, would\nhappen for stars above the curves.\n\n5. Astrophysical signals of quark deconfinement\n5.1 Isolated, rotating neutron stars\nWhether or not quark deconfinement occurs in neutron stars makes only very little difference\nto their static properties, such as the range of possible masses and radii, which renders the detection\nof quark matter in such objects extremely complicated. This may be strikingly different for isolated,\nrotating neutron stars which spin down, and thus become more compressed, because of the emission\nof magnetic dipole radiation and a wind of electron-positron pairs. For some rotating neutron stars\nthe mass and initial rotational frequency may be just such that the central density rises from below\nto above the critical density for dissolution of baryons into their quark constituents. If accompanied\n19\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nby a pronounced shrinkage of the neutron star, as is the case for the neutron star shown in the\ncentral panel in Fig. 4, the star's moment of inertia could change dramatically. As shown in [88],\nthe moment of inertia can decrease so anomalously that it could even introduce an era stellar spinup that may last for \u223c 108 years. Since the dipole age of millisecond pulsars is about 109 years,\none may roughly estimate that about 10% of the solitary millisecond pulsars could be in the quark\ntransition epoch and thus could be signaling the ongoing process of quark deconfinement. Changes\nin the moment of inertia reflect themselves in the braking index, n, of a rotating neutron star, as can\nbe seen from [4, 88, 89]\nn(\u03a9) \u2261\n\n\u03a9 \u03a9\u0308\nI + 3 I \u2032 \u03a9 + I \u2032\u2032 \u03a92\n3 I \u2032 \u03a9 + I \u2032\u2032 \u03a92\n=\n3\n\u2212\n\u2243\n3\n\u2212\n,\nI + I\u2032 \u03a9\n2 I + I\u2032 \u03a9\n\u03a9\u03072\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere dots (primes) denote derivatives with respect to time (\u03a9). The last relation in (5.1) constitutes\nthe non-relativistic limit of the braking index [90]. It is obvious that these expressions reduce to\nthe canonical limit n = 3 if I is independent of frequency. Evidently, this is not the case for rapidly\nTable 2: Dominant neutrino emitting processes in neutron star cores if hyperons and quarks are absent [21].\n\nName\nModified Urca cycle\n(neutron branch)\nModified Urca cycle\n(proton branch)\nBremsstrahlung\nCooper pair\nformations\nDirect Urca cycle\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 condensate\nK \u2212 condensate\n\nProcess\n\nEmissivity\n(erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 )\n\nn + n \u2192 n\u2212+ p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\nn + p + e \u2192 n + n + \u03bde\n\n\u223c 2\u00d71021 R T98\n\nSlow\n\np + n \u2192 p\u2212+ p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\np + p + e \u2192 p + n + \u03bde\n\n\u223c 1021 R T98\n\nSlow\n\n\u223c 1019 R T98\n\nSlow\n\n\u223c 5\u00d71021 R T97\n\u223c 5\u00d71019 R T97\n\nMedium\n\n\u223c 1027 R T96\n\nFast\n\n\u223c 1026 R T96\n\u223c 1025 R T96\n\nFast\nFast\n\nn + n \u2192 n + n + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\nn + p \u2192 n + p + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\np + p \u2192 p + p + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\nn + n \u2192 [nn] + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\np + p \u2192 [pp] + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\nn \u2192 p\u2212+ e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\np + e \u2192 n + \u03bde\nn+ < \u03c0 \u2212 >\u2192 n + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\nn+ < K \u2212 >\u2192 n + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\n\nrotating neutron stars, and it also fails for stars that undergo pronounced compositional changes\n(phase transitions) which alter the moment of inertia significantly. Under favorable circumstances,\nthese changes in I, originating from the transition of confined hadronic matter into quark matter,\nmay cause the braking index to deviate dramatically from 3 in the vicinity of the star's frequency\nwhere the phase transition to quark matter occurs. The changes in I may even be so pronounced that\nn(\u03a9) \u2192 \u00b1\u221e at the transition point [1, 2, 4, 90]. Such dramatic anomalies in n(\u03a9) are not known for\nconventional neutron stars (see left panel in Fig. 4), because their radii and thus moments of inertia\nappear to vary smoothly with \u03a9 [2, 4]. A counterexample to this, however, is discussed in [91].\nThe future astrophysical observation of strong anomalies in the braking behavior of isolated pulsars\ncould thus be cautiously interpreted as a possible astrophysical signal for quark deconfinement in\nneutron stars.\n20\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\nTable 3: Dominant neutrino emitting processes in deconfined quark matter [21].\n\nName\nDirect Urca cycle\n(ud branch)\nDirect Urca cycle\n(us branch)\nModified Urca cycle\n(ud branch)\nModified Urca cycle\n(us branch)\nBremsstrahlungs\nCooper pair\nformations\n\nProcess\n\nEmissivity\n(erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 )\n\nEfficiency\n\nu + e\u2212 \u2192 \u2212\nd + \u03bde\nd \u2192 u + e + \u03bd\u0304e\n\n\u223c 1026 R T96\n\nFast\n\nu + e\u2212 \u2192 s + \u03bde\ns \u2192 u + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e\n\n\u223c 1025 R T96\n\nFast\n\nQ + u + e\u2212 \u2192 Q + \u2212\nd + \u03bde\nQ + d \u2192 Q + u + e + \u03bd\u0304e\n\n\u223c 1021 R T98\n\nSlow\n\nQ + u + e\u2212 \u2192 Q +\u2212s + \u03bde\nQ + s \u2192 Q + u + e \u03bd\u0304e\n\n\u223c 1020 R T98\n\nSlow\n\nQ1 + Q2 \u2192 Q1 + Q2 + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\nu + u \u2192 [uu] + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\nd + d \u2192 [dd] + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\ns + s \u2192 [ss] + \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304\n\n\u223c 1019 R T98\n20 R T 7\n\u223c 2.5\u00d71021\n9\n\u223c 1.5\u00d71021 R T977\n\u223c 1.5\u00d710 R T9\n\nSlow\nMedium\n\n5.2 Accreting neutron stars\nAccreting x-ray neutron stars provide a very interesting contrast to the spin-down of isolated\nneutron stars. These x-ray neutron stars are being spun up by the accretion of matter from a lowermass (M <\n\u223c 0.4M\u2299 ), less-dense companion. If the critical deconfinement density falls within that of\nthe canonical pulsars, quark matter could already exist in them but will be spun out of such stars\nas their frequency increases during accretion. This scenario has been modeled in [92], where it\nwas found that quark matter remains relatively dormant in the core of a neutron star until the star\nhas been spun up to frequencies at which the central density is about to drop below the threshold\ndensity at which quark matter exists. As known from the discussion above, this could manifest\nitself in a significant increase of the star's moment of inertia. The angular momentum added to a\nneutron star during this phase of evolution is therefore consumed by the star's expansion, inhibiting\na further spin-up until the star's quark matter content has been completely converted into a mixed\nphase of hadrons and quarks. Such accreters, therefore, tend to spend a greater length of time in the\ncritical frequencies than otherwise. For canonical accretion rates of 10\u221210 M\u2299 /year the time span\ncan be on the order of 109 years. Hence, from this scenario, one would expect a greater number of\naccreting x-ray neutron stars that appear near the same frequency. Evidence that accreting neutron\nstars pile up at certain frequencies, which are well below the mass shedding limit, is provided by\nthe spin distribution of accreting millisecond pulsars in 57 Tuc and neutron stars in low mass X-ray\nbinaries observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The proposed limiting mechanisms responsible for this behavior is generally attributed to gravity-wave emission caused by the\nr-mode instability, or by a small stellar mass quadrupole moment [93, 94, 95]. Supplemental to\nthese explanations, quark reconfinement (or, more generally, strong first-order like phase transition)\nmay be linked to this phenomenon as well [37, 92, 96, 97].\n\n6.

Already a few minutes after birth, the internal neutron star temperature drops to \u223c 109 K.\nPhoton emission overtakes neutrino emission when the internal temperature has fallen to \u223c 108 K,\nwith a corresponding surface temperature roughly two orders of magnitude smaller. Neutrino cooling dominates for at least the first 103 years, and typically for much longer in standard cooling\n(modified Urca) calculations. The dominant neutrino emitting processes in neutron star matter are\nsummarized in Tables 2 and 3. Figure 13 shows the outcome of cooling calculations performed\nfor a broad collection of equations of state [2, 4] and competing assumptions about the dominant\nneutrino emitting processes. For recent overviews of neutron star cooling, see, for instance, Refs.\n[21, 98]. We also refer to D. Blaschke's contribution contained elsewhere in this volume.\n\n7. Summary\nIt is often stressed that there has never been a more exciting time in the overlapping areas\nof nuclear physics, particle physics and relativistic astrophysics than today. This comes at a time\nwhere new orbiting observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer, Chandra X-ray satellite, and the X-ray Multi Mirror Mission (XMM) have extended\nour vision tremendously, allowing us to observe compact star phenomena with an unprecedented\nclarity and angular resolution that previously were only imagined. On the Earth, radio telescopes\n(Arecibo, Green Bank, Parkes, VLA) and instruments using adaptive optics and other revolutionary\n22\n\n\fStrangeness in compact stars\n\nFridolin Weber\n\ntechniques have exceeded previous expectations of what can be accomplished from the ground.\nFinally, the gravitational wave detectors LIGO, LISA, and VIRGO are opening up a window for\nthe detection of gravitational waves emitted from compact stellar objects such as neutron stars and\nblack holes. This unprecedented situation is providing us with key information on compact stars,\nwhich are the only physical objects in which cold and dense baryonic matter is realized in nature.\nAs discussed in this paper, a key role in compact star physics is played by strangeness. It alters\nthe masses, radii, cooling behavior, and surface composition of neutron stars. Other important\nobservables may be the spin evolution of isolated neutron stars and neutron stars in low-mass x-ray\nbinaries. All told, these observables are key in exploring the phase diagram of dense nuclear matter\nat high baryon number density but low temperature, which is not accessible to relativistic heavy\nion collision experiments.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
