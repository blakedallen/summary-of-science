O. Box 0, Socorro, NM 87801, USA\n\n2\n\nHarvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, SAO/SMA Project, P.O. Box 824, Hilo, HI 96721, USA\n\n3\n\nSpace Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nmasers in close orbit around the nucleus of NGC 4258 (Miyoshi et al. 1995, Greenhill et al.\n1995). This system provided some of the earliest and strongest evidence for the presence\nof a supermassive black hole in the nucleus and led to a direct distance measurement to\nNGC 4258 which has helped to refine the extragalactic distance scale (Herrnstein et al.\n1999).\nThe water maser emission in TXS 2226-184 was discovered by Koekemoer et al. (1995)\nusing the Effelsberg telescope. This system hosts the most luminous known extragalactic\nH2 O maser source, a so-called \"gigamaser\", with an isotropic luminosity in the 22 GHz line\nof 6100 L\u2299 (Koekemoer et al. 1995). The water maser emission from TXS 2226-184 is fairly\nbroad, with a FWHM of 88 km s\u22121 , in contrast to most known extragalactic water masers\nwith linewidths of only a few km s\u22121 . VLBI observations by Ball et al. (2004, in preparation)\nreveal that the masers are distributed in clumps that trace a disk oriented in position angle\n\u221265\u25e6 , about 30 degrees tilt away from the major axis of the galaxy. One blueshifted maser\nappears significantly offset from this disk, which may indicate that it is associated with the\njet.\nRecent HST observations by Falcke et al. (2000) classify the galaxy as a highly inclined\nspiral and reveal a dust lane cutting across the nucleus. Falcke et al. (2000) also present\nVLA observations at 8.4 GHz showing that the radio emission is compact (< 1\u2032\u2032 ), symmetric,\nand has an axis perpendicular to the dust lane. No larger-scale diffuse emission is present to\nthe sensitivity limits of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at about 2 mJy beam\u22121 (Fig. 2;\nCondon et al. 1998).\nThere is a fair amount of overlap in the occurance (\u223c40%) between extragalactic H2 O\nmaser systems and Hi found in absorption (Taylor et al. 2002). The Hi can be used to\nstudy the dynamics near the central engine of active galaxies, illuminating the process of\naccretion and jet propagation near a massive black hole. For this reason Taylor et al. (2002)\nundertook a study of the Hi gas in TXS 2226-184 with the VLA and discovered that it\nconsists of two components \u2013 one with a width of 125 km s\u22121 , and another broader feature of\nwidth 420 km s\u22121 . Both velocity components are found toward the compact radio source in\nthe nucleus of the galaxy, co-spatial within the uncertainties with the water masers. Taylor\net al. suggested that the narrow line might be indicative of an interaction between the radio\njet and the surrounding material.\nIn this study we make use of VLBI observations that resolve the radio continuum in\nthe central 0.5 kpc, and also spatially resolve the Hi absorption. We use this information to\nbetter characterize the nature of this system and to determine the powering mechanism for\nthe exceptionally luminous maser emission.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThroughout this discussion, we assume H0 =71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.27, and \u03a9\u039b =\n0.73, resulting in a linear to angular scale ratio of 0.496 kpc arcsecond\u22121 1 .\n\n2.\n\nThe VLBA Observations\n\nThe observations were made with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory2 Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA) and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at a center\nfrequency of 1386 MHz on 2002 December 14 and 15. A total of 8.4 hours were obtained\non source using 256 channels across a 16 MHz band to provide a resolution of 14 km s\u22121 .\nBoth right and left circular polarizations were observed. Phase calibration was obtained by\nshort (1 min) observations of the nearby (1.98 degrees distant), moderately strong (0.25 Jy)\ncalibrator J2236-1706 every 3 minutes. Bandpass calibration was provided by observations\nof J2253+1608.\nObservations at 4982 MHz were carried out with the VLBA alone on 2002 December\n16. A total of 2.2 hours were obtained on source with a 32 MHz bandwidth observing in\nright circular polarization only. Phase referencing was once again performed by switching\nto J2236-1706 every 3 minutes for 1 minute. We also checked the atmospheric coherence by\nobserving J2236\u22121433 once every 38 minutes.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nMERLIN Continuum Images\n\nData at 5 GHz from observations of the TXS 2226-184 field were obtained from the\nMulti-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) archive. These data consisted of two observing sessions, one on 1999 February 3, and another on 1999 March 3. In\neach session 6 antennas participated for a total of 4.2 and 4.9 hours on source in February\nand March respectively. Calibration of these data was performed in the standard fashion in\nAIPS using the nearby calibrator J2232-1659 observed every 7 minutes. Data from the two\ndays were combined and then imaged using Difmap. The rms noise in the total intensity\nimage is 0.085 mJy beam\u22121 .\n1\n2\n\nDerived using E.L. Wright's cosmology calculator at http://www.astro.ucla.edu/ wright/CosmoCalc.html.\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAt the MERLIN resolution of 40 \u00d7 179 mas TXS 2226-184 is dominated by a compact\ncore, but shows jet-like extensions to the northwest and southeast (Fig. 1). The compact\ncore has a peak flux density at 5 GHz of 13.6 mJy. The orientation of the jets at 144\u25e6\nis in excellent agreement with the the elongation angle of 145\u25e6 seen in the 22 GHz VLA\nobservations (Taylor et al. 2002) with resolution 390 \u00d7 210 mas. In the MERLIN image we\nfind a total of 31.1 \u00b1 0.93 mJy compared to 32.2 \u00b1 0.98 detected by the VLA (Taylor et al.\n2002). A little less than half of this emission, 13.6 mJy, is in the compact core with a size of\n<45 mas.\n\n3.2.\n\nVLBA Continuum Images\n\nStarting with the phase referenced VLBA+GBT image at 1.4 GHz from the standard\ncalibration in AIPS, we performed phase self-calibration in Difmap. In Fig. 2 we show\nthe 1.4 GHz continuum emission from TXS 2226-184 at resolutions of 20 \u00d7 12 mas and 45\nmas. Both images were made using natural weighting and applying a taper to downweight\nthe longest spacings. Only 35 mJy, about half the flux density of the 73.3 mJy compact\nVLA core, is successfully recovered in these images. Besides a bright and resolved region of\ndiameter 0.1 arcseconds, there is diffuse emission to the northwest along a position angle of\n\u221236\u25e6 . This agrees well with the VLA and MERLIN orientations on somewhat larger scales\n(see Fig. 1). The milliarcsecond-scale emission is broken up into clumps, most likely as a\nresult of difficulties of the clean algorithm in recovering the extended emission. A multiresolution clean was attempted in AIPS, but did not recover more flux density or produce\na better image. The MERLIN image at 5 GHz shows diffuse emission on scales of \u223c0.3\narcseconds that we do not resolve with the VLA, but probably over-resolve with the VLBA.\nThe rms noise in the VLBA continuum image is 50 microJy/beam in the high resolution\nimage and 100 microJy/beam in the 45 mas image owing to the heavier taper applied.\nThe rms noise at 5 GHz is 100 microJy/beam, and the peak in the map is 500 microJy.\nWhile there is a suggestion of some flux density on the shortest baselines, no sources are\nreliably detected. From our phase referencing check source, J2236\u22121433, we estimate the\ncoherence to be greater than 50%. We place an upper limit of 1 mJy beam\u22121 as the strongest\nunresolved source that could go undetected at 5 GHz. An attempt to combine the VLBA\nand MERLIN data was made, but owing to the lack of signal on the VLBA baselines, this\nwas unsuccessful.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.3.\n\nThe H i Absorption\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show Hi spectra for four of the brightest regions in the high resolution\nimage. The continuum level has been subtracted from the spectral line cube. The spectra\nhave been Hanning smoothed and averaged to a velocity resolution of 23.98 km s\u22121 . The\nabsorption peaks in all spectra at 7500 km s\u22121 in the heliocentric frame. In the region of\nhighest SNR the absorption has a depth of 2.6 mJy, and a FWHM of 125 km s\u22121 . There is\na hint of an additional component around 7700 km s\u22121 in all but the weakest profile.\nWe have created an image of the integrated optical depth over the line by averaging\n24 channels centered on the peak absorption using the cube with 45 mas spatial resolution\n(Fig. 4). We find a marginally significant increase in the optical depth from 0.15 \u00b1 0.04 to\n0.34 \u00b1 0.08.\nFinally, we have searched for gradients in velocity by averaging in the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the source. To do this we rotated the cube spatially by \u221255\u25e6\nand then averaged over the source in declination. A position-velocity plot from this averaged\ncube is shown in Fig. 5. No significant gradient in velocity is seen.\n\n3.4.\n\nLocation of the Neutral Hydrogen Gas\n\nBased on the VLA observations, Taylor et al. concluded that the \u223c420 km s\u22121 wide\nabsorption feature with a depth of 5.6 mJy probably results from neutral material associated\nwith the atomic and molecular torus thought to feed the active nucleus, and that the deeper\n\u223c125 km s\u22121 wide line in TXS 2226-184 could be indicative of an interaction between the\nradio jet and surrounding material. If the supposition about the nature of the broad line\nwere correct, then a compact nucleus with at least 5.6 mJy should have been visible in the\n1.4 GHz continuum image. The peak in the full resolution image (not shown) is only 2.4\nmJy. From the absence of any broad-line absorption in our VLBI spectra we conclude that\nthe broad line originates from emission on spatial scales of \u223c0.3 arsec that are not probed by\nour VLBA observations. Similarly, a 1000 km s\u22121 wide blue-shifted line seen in the WSRT\nspectrum towards 3C 293 (Morganti et al. 2003) was not detected on the parsec-scale by\nBeswick et al. (2004). Another example of broad lines resolving out on the parsec-scale\ncan be found in 4C12.50 (Morganti et al. 2004). Morganti et al. (2003) speculate that the\nbroad line arises from outflow of gas on kiloparsec-scales, and the same situation could be\nresponsible for the broad line in TXS 2226-184.\nThe narrow (125 km s\u22121 ) and deeper (12.3 mJy for the VLA) Hi line in TXS 2226-184\nhas a similar width and velocity dispersion to the water masers and could originate from the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsame region. The lack of any significant velocity gradient in the Hi observations is consistent\nwith this interpretation.\nAnother possibility is that we are seeing multiple Hi clouds from throughout the spiral\nhost galaxy along the line-of-sight toward the nucleus. In this case the Hi gas would not\nbe associated with the nucleus or the water masers. The marginally significant change in\nHi opacity across the source (see Fig. 4) argues against this possibility since the average Hi\nabsorption from the host galaxy is unlikely to change on scales as small as 100 pc.\n\n4.\n\nNature of the Continuum Emission and Water Masers\n\nObservationally, extragalactic water masers can be separated into three categories based\non their line widths, luminosities and distribution of masing regions. One class, with narrow\nlinewidths of a few km s\u22121 , and isotropic luminosities \u223c100 L\u2299 , is most frequently associated\nwith the accretion disk around an AGN (e.g., NGC 4258 , Miyoshi et al. 1995). The second,\npossibly less common, class of masers is characterized by broader linewidths of \u223c100 km\ns\u22121 , and luminosities in the range 100-3000 L\u2299 (e.g., Mrk 348, Peck et al. 2003; NGC 1052,\nClaussen et al. 1998). The third, recently identified class are weaker, <10 L\u2299 , masers with\nnarrow linewidths (e.g., NGC 2146, Tarchi et al. 2002). The criteria for characterizing the\ndifferent classes of masers are outlined in Peck et al (2004).\nAssuming that the masing region completely covers the radio emitting core at 22 GHz,\nKoekemoer et al. (1995) found that the required maser amplification in TXS 2226-184 is a\nfactor of \u223c20. If the maser covers less of the continuum source then the amplification must\nbe even greater. In this section we consider three scenarios to explain the nature of the radio\nemission and the extragalactic water masers in TXS 2226-184.\n\n4.1.\n\nCase 1: A Compact Starburst\n\nThe clumpy, steep-spectrum radio morphology of TXS 2226-184 on the parsec scale\n(Fig. 2) is reminiscent of the starburst galaxies Mrk 231 and Mrk 273 (Carilli, Wrobel, &\nUlvestad 1998, Carilli & Taylor 2000), which also contain active galactic nuclei. Given the\nsteep spectrum of the overall emission in TXS 2226-184, the individual components could\nbe radio supernovae, or clusters of SNe. The H2 O emission and Hi absorption likewise are\nfound to occur on similar spatial scales in these prominent starburst systems.\nA significant problem with the starburst scenario is the low infrared luminosity. As\nlisted in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), TXS 2226-184 is not detected by\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIRAS at 12, 25 and 100 microns, and is only 309 \u00b1 59 mJy at 60 microns. Given the distance\nto the source this corresponds to a power at 60 microns of 4.15 \u00d7 1023 W/Hz. Scaling the\nstarburst emission models of Rice et al. (1988) we get LIR = 7.5 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 . This corresponds\nto a star formation rate of just 0.178 M\u2299 /yr (Heckman et al. 1990), far below what is\nfound in even the weakest starburst galaxies. One can also ask the question of how well this\nsystem obeys the well established radio-far IR correlation (Condon 1992). The integrated\nradio power at 1.4 GHz is P1.4 = 1.01 \u00d7 1023 W/Hz. We find a logarithmic ratio of FIR\nto radio power, Q=\u22122.3, compared to the average value of +2.3 \u00b1 0.2 (Condon 1992). At\npresent, given the anomalous nature of these findings, we cannot rule out the possibility that\nthere is some error in the IRAS measurement, so we plan to undertake new IR observations\nto confirm the value.\nThat we could be seeing individual supernovae in TXS 2226-184 is unlikely since Cas A\nwould have a flux density of only \u223c1 \u03bcJy at the distance of TXS 2226-184, although young\nradio supernovae might have powers 100 \u2013 1000 times that of Cas A (Weiler et al. 2002; Neff\net al. 2004). However, we would expect them to have some reasonable flux at 5 GHz if they\nare young enough to have such high brightness temperature, so the lack of any detection\nat 5 GHz argues against the supernova hypothesis. The distribution of the radio emission\nperpendicular to the major axis is also not readily explained by SNe.\nIt is possible that this source could be a \"post-starburst\" object in which the diffuse\nradio emission was created by a starburst. Koekemoer et al. (1995) refer to unpublished\nobservations that suggest an optical continuum dominated by a \"post-starburst\" stellar\npopulation. Assuming minimum energy conditions apply, the fairly high field derived, Bme\n= 630 \u03bcG, together with the observed spectral index of \u22120.66 between 1.4 and 5 GHz,\nimplies an age of the radio source of only 14,000 years (Myers & Spangler 1985). If the radio\nsource is considerably older then some reacceleration process must be at work. Over the\n\u223c108 years since the starburst one might expect the radio source to have become much less\ncollimated than we currently observe. We conclude that the small amount of star formation\ntaking place in TXS 2226-184 is unlikely to produce the majority of the radio continuum\nemission. It is also difficult to see how this low amount of star formation could provide the\nshocks necessary to create the conditions for masing.\n\n4.2.\n\nCase 2: Amplification of a Background AGN\n\nThe parsec-scale radio emission is elongated in the same direction as the kiloparsecscale emission, and is perpendicular to the major axis of the host galaxy and the inner dust\ndisk (Falcke et al. 2000). The symmetric structure and tight collimation of the outflow in\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nTXS 2226-184 suggests that the radio continuum is produced by jets oriented at a large angle\nto the line-of-sight propagating perpendicular to the accretion disk. Falcke et al. also find\nthat the radio emission is aligned with H\u03b1 + [N II] emission and suggest that this Narrow\nLine Region (NLR) is produced by the interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar\nmedium (Falcke, Wilson & Simpson 1998). Koekemoer et al (1995) note that the optical\nspectrum of the nucleus has line ratios typical of a low-ionization nuclear emission region\n(LINER) spectrum. The optical spectrum and the presence of jets suggest the presence of\nan active nucleus.\nAn examination of the radio continuum emission reveals no obvious compact, flat spectrum source readily identifiable with the nucleus. At 5 GHz we can use the limiting flux\ndensity of 1 mJy to put an upper limit on the core radio power at 5 GHz of < 1.4 \u00d7 1021\nW/Hz. This core power is lower than all but a few low luminosity radio sources in the\nComplete Bologna Sky Survey (Giovannini et al. 2004) despite the fact that the radio power\nof P0.365 = 2.72 \u00d7 1023 W/Hz at 365 MHz is only about an order of magnitude below the\naverage total power in a complete sample of radio galaxies. From this we can conclude that\nthe core is extremely underluminous. This could imply subrelativistic ejection and/or an\nangle very close to the plane of the sky. Alternatively, the core could be heavily obscured by\nfree-free absorption. Since the free-free absorption from an external screen decreases exponentially with frequency, further sensitive, high-frequency VLBI observations might detect\nan obscured, flat-spectrum nucleus. Such a heavily absorbed nucleus might also make a\nsignificant contribution to the total flux density at high frequencies. There is no indication\nof any flattening in the spectrum up to 22 GHz (Taylor et al. 2002), from which we place\na limit on the contribution of any flat spectrum component of <10% or < 0.7 mJy. Ball et\nal. (2004, in preparation) place a limit of < 2 mJy on any compact continuum emission at\n22 GHz. If the masers are limited to the central few parsecs around a low-power core then\nthe amplification needed will be >600. Alternatively, the X-ray illumination provided by the\nAGN may create a disassociation region and power the maser directly (Neufeld, Maloney,\n& Conger 1994). Koekemoer et al. (1995) find that this model can account for the maser\nluminosity of TXS 2226-184 if the illuminated disk is 2.5 \u2013 7.5 pc in radius. Ball et al. (2004,\nin preparation) find a disk of radius 5 pc, but do not rule out the possibility that some of\nthe components are associated with the radio jet.\n\n4.3.\n\nCase 3: Shocks Driven by a Jet\n\nAs already established in the previous section, it is likely that there are bidirectional\njets in TXS 2226-184. The peak radio flux density at 1.4 GHz in TXS 2226-184 is 3.6 mJy.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe brightness temperature of this emission is 1.4 \u00d7107 K. This, and the steep spectrum of\nthe integrated emission (\u03b1 = \u22120.66 from Taylor et al. 2002, where S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) clearly indicates\nnon-thermal emission.\nA possible explanation for the luminous water masers in TXS 2226-184 is from shocks\nproduced by a jet driving into a molecular cloud, though if this is to explain all the masers\nthen the jet needs to bend through 60 degrees in order to line up with the jet seen on scales\nof 10-1000 pc (Ball et al. 2004, in preparation). The situation may be comparable to that in\nMrk 348, a Seyfert galaxy at a distance of 62.5 Mpc which hosts an H2 O megamaser (Peck et\nal. 2003). In Mrk 348, the maser appears to be caused by the radio jet impacting a molecular\ncloud within the central few parsecs of the galaxy. This interaction gives rise to an expanding\nbow-shock driven into the cloud which has a velocity between 135 km s\u22121 and 0.5c in the\ndirection of jet propagation, and between 35 km s\u22121 and 300 km s\u22121 at various points along\nthe oblique edges (Peck et al. 2003). This shock generates a region of very high temperature,\n(\u2264105 K), which dissociates the molecular gas and to some extent shatters the dust grains\nexpected to be present and/or evaporates their icy mantles. Immediately following this\nshock, H2 begins forming on the surviving dust grains when the temperature has dropped to\n\u223c1000 K, and this in turn provides sufficient heating to stabilize the temperature at \u223c400 K,\nwith gas densities of \u223c108 cm\u22123 (e.g., Mauersberger, Henkel & Wilson 1987; Elitzur 1995).\nIn Mrk 348, the pc-scale radio jet is significantly brighter than that in TXS 2226-184, but it\nis possible that a weaker jet could result in stronger amplification than a powerful jet, given\nthat it is the regions of oblique shocks, with velocities lower than 300 km s\u22121 , which provide\npost-shock conditions leading to a significant volume of masing gas.\nThis possibility has also been explored for another Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1068. A similar\nluminosity, linear radio emission extending over \u223c1\" is seen in NGC 1068 (Gallimore, Baum,\n& O'Dea 1996). In this well-studied source Gallimore et al. find a bending jet and local\nflattening of the spectral index which lends support to this model.\nOne of the chief diagnostics of this type of maser is the shape and width of the emission\nline (Peck et al 2004), given that jet and accretion disk geometry can be very difficult to\ndecipher at large distances using the distribution of H2 O spots and Hi absorption, even with\nextremely high angular resolution. The FWHM of the maser emission in TXS 2226-184 is 88\nkm s\u22121 , much closer to the 130 km s\u22121 FWHM measured in Mrk 348 than to the narrower\nlines associated with masers known to arise in accretion disks. Nonetheless, we look forward\nto higher dynamic range VLBA and Expanded VLA images to assist in testing this model\nin TXS 2226-184.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur observations show that on parsec scales the continuum emission from an active\nnucleus in TXS 2226-184 is extremely weak. Most of the emission originates from a jet\nwhich extends over \u223c100 pc. Hi absorption is detected against this jet with a marginal\nchange in opacity, but no sign of rotation or outflow. The water masers may amplify either\na weak nucleus, or extended jet emission. In either case, high amplification factors (> 600)\nare needed.\nGiven the extreme luminosity of the water masers in TXS 2226-184 and their broad line\nwidths, it is tempting to ascribe this and similar systems (e.g., Mrk 348, NGC 1052) with jets\nthat drive shocks into molecular clouds. Our high-resolution radio continuum observations\nare consistent with this picture. Identifications of more systems, and detailed studies of\ntime-variability in the masers and continuum emission are needed.\nVLBI observations of the water masers will help to understanding the nature of this\nsystem, though the preliminary analysis indicates that the situation is complicated with\nboth disk and jet masers present (Ball et al. 2004, in preparation). Single dish observations\ncould also yield important clues by looking for rapid variations in the flux density of the\nmaser line, and correlating them with changes in the continuum flux density to test the idea\nthat the masers amplify the background continuum.\nWe thank Y.
