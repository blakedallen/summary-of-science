The theoretical angular correlation function is derived for different bias\nfunctions, corresponding to different values of the ratio Mhalo /Msph between the mass\nof the dark halo and the final mass in stars. SCUBA sources are predicted to be\nstrongly clustered, with a clustering strength increasing with mass. We show that\nthe model accounts for the clustering of Lyman-break Galaxies, seen as the optical\ncounterpart of low- to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies and is also consistent with the observed angular correlation function of Extremely Red Objects. Best\nagreement is obtained for Mhalo /Msph = 100. We also consider the implications for\nsmall scale fluctuations observed at sub-mm wavelengths by current or forthcoming\nexperiments aimed at mapping the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The predicted amplitude of the clustering signal in the 350 GHz channel of the Planck mission\nstrongly depends on the halo-to-bulge mass ratio and may be of comparable amplitude\nto primary CMB anisotropies for multipole numbers l >\n\u223c 50.\nKey words: galaxies: clustering - galaxies: infrared - cosmology: theory - large-scale\nstructure - cosmology: cosmic microwave background\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe advent of the 450-850 \u03bcm Submillimetre Common User\nBolometric Array (SCUBA) camera (Holland et al. 1999)\nhas opened the possibility of exploiting the enormous potential of sub-mm astronomy for investigating the early phases\nof galaxy evolution, taking advantage of the strongly negative K-correction which boosts the visibility of high-z galaxies (Smail, Ivison & Blain 1997; Barger et al. 1998; Hughes\net al. 1998; Barger, Cowie & Sanders 1999; Eales et al. 1999;\nBlain et al. 1999a).\nA variety of models has been proposed to reproduce\nthe properties of the submillimetre population (e.g. Guiderdoni et al. 1998; Blain et al. 1999b; Devriendt, Guiderdoni\n& Sadat 1999; Devriendt & Guiderdoni 2000; Takeuchi et\nal. 2000; Pearson 2000), in particular the dramatic starformation rate inferred from the data.\nGranato et al. (2000 - hereafter Paper I) propose a unified scheme for the formation of the QSO and spheroidal\npopulation. According to their model, at the time of the onset of the QSO activity, the host galaxy has already underc 0000 RAS\n\ngone a major star-formation event, with a characteristic time\nTB ranging from \u223c 0.5 to \u223c 2 Gyr when going from more\nto less massive hosts. The QSO onset practically stops the\nstar-formation process, and when eventually the reservoir of\ngas fueling the Active Galactic Nuclei is exhausted, the host\ngalaxy will evolve in a passive way, with a spectrum becoming quickly red. This approach identifies SCUBA galaxies as\nthe progenitors of QSO hosts and provides an excellent description of (amongst others) the observed 850 \u03bcm number\ncounts.\nIn this paper we present predictions on clustering properties of SCUBA galaxies in the framework of the Granato\net al. (2000) model. Such properties are determined by the\ncombination of the evolution of the underlying mass fluctuations and the bias relating galaxy overdensities to mass.\nSince the bias factor is determined by properties related to\nthe process of galaxy formation, it follows that measurements of clustering can lead to very precious insights on the\ngalaxy population producing the signal.\nUnfortunately the number of SCUBA galaxies observed\n\n\f2\n\nM. Magliocchetti, L. Moscardini, P. Panuzzo, G.L. Granato, G. De Zotti, L. Danese\n\nis still too small to allow for any clustering measurement.\nThe model by Granato et al. (2000) however establishes a\ntight link between this population and Lyman-break galaxies (Steidel et al. 1996; LBGs hereafter), interpreted as\nlower-mass/lower-submm luminosity sources. Such model\ncan thus be tested against measurements of LBG clustering (Giavalisco et al. 1998). A further test is provided by\nthe recent detection (Daddi et al. 2000) of strong clustering of Extremely Red Objects (EROs), which were found to\nbe the optical counterparts of two of the still few SCUBA\nsources having reliable optical identifications (Smail et al.\n1999).\nAn important issue related to the above discussion is the\neffect of clustering on small scale anisotropies at mm/submm wavelengths, where experiments to map the Cosmic Microwave Background either have been (e.g. BOOMERanG,\nMAXIMA, TopHat, ACBAR, ARCHEOPS) or are about\nto be carried out (notably the ESA's Planck mission). Small\nscale fluctuations of the background intensity due to clustering of unresolved sources are proportional to the amplitude\nof their two-point correlation function and to their volume\nemissivity (see, e.g., De Zotti et al. 1996). The deep SCUBA\nsurveys have demonstrated that the bulk of the extragalactic\nbackground at 850 \u03bcm comes from a relatively small number\nof sources (at least ten time less than those accounting for\nthe bulk of the optical/UV background) at substantial redshifts. Combining the (rather limited) direct spectroscopic\ninformation (e.g. Frayer 2000) with estimates based on the\nsub-mm to radio spectral index (Carilli & Yun 1999), it is\nconcluded that the median redshift of the sub-mm population brighter than \u223c 1 mJy is probably \u223c 2.5\u20133 (Smail et\nal. 2000). It then follows that most of the background comes\nfrom a population of extremely luminous (hence presumably\nvery massive) high-z galaxies which probably correspond to\nthe rare, high density peaks in the primordial matter distribution. The standard structure formation scenario predicts\nthat these peaks are strongly clustered (Kaiser 1984; Baron\n& White 1987). Also, according to the currently favoured\nview, SCUBA sources probably correspond to the phase of\nintense star formation in large spheroidal galaxies, a process\nthat appears to be completed for z > 1; as a consequence,\nthe relevant redshift range is limited and dilution of the clustering signal is relatively small.\nThe amplitude of intensity fluctuations due to clustering is correspondingly expected to be large. Scott & White\n(1999) worked out a preliminary estimate adopting for submm sources the angular correlation function determined for\nz \u223c 3 LBGs (which however are mostly undetectable by\nSCUBA; see Chapman et al. 2000). Here we provide quantitative estimates of this effect using a technique developed\nby Peacock & Dodds (1996), Matarrese et al. (1997) and\nMoscardini et al. (1998), which takes into account the effects of the past light-cone, the linear and non-linear growth\nof clustering and the evolution of the bias factor. The epochdependent mass distribution of sources is modelled following\nGranato et al. (2000).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will be\ndevoted to the analysis of the clustering of SCUBA galaxies and comparisons with the observed clustering properties\nof LBGs and EROs, while in Section 3 we use the findings\nof Section 2 to make predictions on the temperature fluctuations produced by unresolved SCUBA-like sources and to\n\ndiscuss their implications for experiments aimed at mapping\nthe CMB at sub-mm wavelengths. Section 4 summarizes our\nconclusions.\nThroughout the paper we will assume a cosmological\nmodel with h0 = 0.7, \u03a90 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7, and adopt the normalization of the rms mass fluctuation \u03c38 = 1 determined\nby the 4-year COBE data (Bunn & White 1997).\n\n2\n\nCLUSTERING OF SCUBA SOURCES\n\nThe angular two-point correlation function w(\u03b8) is defined as\nthe excess probability, \u03b4P , with respect to a random Poisson\ndistribution, of finding two sources in the solid angles \u03b4\u03a91\n\u03b4\u03a92 separated by an angle \u03b8, and it is defined by\n\u03b4P = n2 \u03b4\u03a91 \u03b4\u03a92 [1 + w(\u03b8)]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the mean number density of objects in the particular catalogue under consideration.\nThe theoretical expression for w(\u03b8) can be derived from\nits spatial counterpart \u03be by projection via the relativistic\nLimber equation (Peebles 1980):\nw(\u03b8) = 2\n\nR \u221eR \u221e\n0\n\n0\n\nN 2 (z) b2eff (Mmin , z) (dz/dx) \u03be(r, z) dz du\n\n\u0002R \u221e\n0\n\nN (z) dz\n\n\u00032\n\n,\n\nwhere x is the comoving radial coordinate, r = (u2 +x2 \u03b82 )1/2\n(for a flat universe and in the small angle approximation:\n\u03b8 \u226a 1 rad), and N (z) is the number of objects within the\nshell (z, z + dz).\nThe mass-mass correlation function \u03be(r, z) to be inserted in eq.(2) has been obtained following the work by\nPeacock & Dodds (1996, but also see Magliocchetti et al.,\n2000), extended by Matarrese et al. (1997) and Moscardini\net al. 1998) to redshifts z > 0, which provides an analytical way to derive the trend of \u03be(r, z) both in the linear and\nnon-linear regime. Note that \u03be(r, z) only depends on the\nunderlying cosmology and on the normalization of \u03c38 . The\nrelevant properties of SCUBA galaxies are included in the\nredshift distribution of sources N (z), where N (z) dz gives\nthe number of objects in the shell (z, z + dz) (given in Paper\nI and shown in Fig. 1 for fluxes respectively greater than 1,\n10, 50 mJy), and in the bias factor beff (Mmin , z).\nThe effective bias factor beff (Mmin , z) of all haloes with\nmasses greater than some threshold Mmin is obtained by\nintegrating the quantity b(M, z) - representing the bias of\nindividual haloes of mass M - opportunely weighted by the\nnumber density nSCU BA (M, z) of SCUBA sources:\nbeff (z) =\n\nR\u221e\n\ndM b(M, z) nSCUBA (M, z)\n\nMmin\n\u221e\n\nR\n\nMmin\n\ndM nSCUBA (M, z)\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that as nSCUBA can be thought as the fraction of haloes\nhosting a galaxy in the process of forming stars, its expression can also be written as nSCU BA (M, z) = n(M, z) TB /th ,\nwhere n(M, z) dM is the mass spectrum of haloes with\nmasses between M and M + dM (Press & Schechter, 1974;\nSheth & Tormen, 1999), TB is the duration of the starformation burst and th is the life-time of the haloes in which\nthese objects reside (see Martini & Weinberg, 2000).

Note that\nthe assumption of a linear bias is justified by the redshift\ndistribution of the sources, all appearing for z >\n\u223c 0.75 (see\ne.g. Somerville et al., 2001).\nAccording to Granato et al. (2000), sources showing up\nin the SCUBA counts can be broadly divided into three categories: low-mass (masses in the range Msph \u2243 109 \u22121010 M\u2299 ,\nduration of the star formation burst TB \u223c 2 Gyr, and typ10\nical fluxes S <\n\u223c 1 mJy), intermediate-mass (Msph \u22431110 \u2013\n1011 M\u2299 and TB \u223c 1 Gyr) and high-mass (Msph >\n10\nM\n\u2299,\n\u223c\nTB \u223c 0.5 Gyr, dominating the counts at fluxes S >\n5\n\u223c \u2212\n10 mJy). Note that by Msph we denote the mass in stars at\ncompletion of the star formation process.\nIn order to evaluate the bias factor in eq.(3) we then consider\ntwo extreme cases for the ratio between the mass in stars\nand the mass of the host dark halo: Mhalo /Msph = 100 and\nMhalo /Msph = 10. Note that Mhalo /Msph = 10 roughly corresponds to the ratio \u03a90 /\u03a9baryon between total and baryon\ndensity, where we adopted for the latter quantity the standard value from primordial nucleosynthesis; this corresponds\nto having assumed all the baryons to be locked into stars\nand, as a consequence, gives a conservative lower limit to\nthe quantity Mhalo /Msph . Mhalo /Msph = 100 is instead related to \u03a90 /\u03a9\u22c6 , \u03a9\u22c6 being the present mass density in visible\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.

The\nlikely value should be Msph /Mhalo = 1 \u2212 3 % (cf. Paper I).\nArmed with the above results we can finally evaluate\nthe two-point correlation function in eq. (2) for different\nMhalo /Msph ratios and different flux cuts. Figure 2 presents\nour predictions for w(\u03b8), respectively for a flux cut of 50\n(solid line), 10 (dashed line) and 1 (dotted line) mJy. Higher\ncurves of each kind correspond to the case Mhalo /Msph =\n100, while lower curves refer to the Mhalo /Msph = 10 one.\nThe highest clustering amplitude is found for the brightest sources (S \u2265 50 mJy). This is because they are associated to the most massive dark halos and are therefore highly\nbiased tracers of the dark matter distribution. In addition,\naccording to the model by Granato et al. (2000), they have\na rather narrow redshift distribution (see Fig. 1), so that the\ndilution of the clustering signal is minimum.\nThe very sharp drop of all the curves at \u03b8 \u2243 1\u25e6 is due to the\nabsence of nearby (z <\n\u223c 1, see Fig. 1) objects. This reflects\nthe notion that the actively star-forming phase in spheroids\nis completed at z > 1.\nThe model introduced in PaperI establishes a strong\nlink between SCUBA sources and LBGs where this latter\npopulation is predicted to be the low- to intermediate-mass\ntail of primeval spheroidal galaxies, with TB \u223c 1 \u2212 2 Gyr\nand a star-formation rate ranging from a few to a hundred\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nMeasurements of the angular correlation function of LBGs\n(Giavalisco et al. 1998) then offer a way to test such model.\nIn Fig. 3 we plotted the expected w(\u03b8) for sources with\n10\nS \u2265 1 mJy (corresponding to Msph >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 ) within the\nredshift range 2.5 \u2264 z \u2264 3.5, covered by the Giavalisco\net al. (1998) sample. As in Fig. 2, the higher curve is for\nMhalo /Msph = 100, the lower one for Mhalo /Msph = 10. The\n\n\fM. Magliocchetti, L. Moscardini, P. Panuzzo, G.L. Granato, G. De Zotti, L.

This result, apart from providing a\nfurther proof of the tight link between SCUBA galaxies and\nLBGs, also confirms the expectations of Paper I for a small\nfraction (on the order of a few percent) of the total mass to\nbe confined into stars.\nStrong clustering of EROs has been recently detected by\nDaddi et al. (2000). This result may again provide a relevant\ntest for our model since it seems likely for a substantial fraction of SCUBA galaxies to be EROs with R\u2212K \u2265 6: at least\ntwo out of nine (> 20%) sources in the Cluster Lens Survey\nbelong to this class (Smail et al. 1999), while other submillimeter surveys have discovered additional EROs as counterparts of SCUBA sources (Ivison et al. 2000).

Its general expression is:\nI=\n\nZ\n\nSd\n\n0\n\n=\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\ndN\nS dS\ndS\n\nZ\n\nLmax\n\ndlogL L\n\nLmin\n\nZ\n\nzmax\n\ndz \u03a6(L, z)\n\nz(Sd ,L)\n\nK(L, z) dx\n(1 + z)2 dz\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere (\u03b8 , \u03c6 ) and (\u03b8 , \u03c6 ) define two positions on the sky\nseparated by an angle \u03b8, can be expressed as the sum of two\nterms CP and CC , the first one due to Poisson noise (i.e.\nfluctuations given by randomly distributed objects), and the\nsecond one owing to source clustering.\nScott & White (1999) have shown that if dusty galaxies cluster like LBGs (Giavalisco et al. 1998), anisotropies\ndue to clustering dominate the Poisson ones at all angular\nscales. According to our model, LBGs are the optical counterparts of the low- to intermediate- mass tail of SCUBA\ngalaxies; as illustrated in Figure 2, this makes the clustering\nsignal of LBGs a factor \u223c 10 lower than the one obtained for\nSCUBA galaxies; therefore we can safely assume the Poisson\nterm CP to be negligible in the following analysis and only\nconcentrate on temperature fluctuations caused by the CC\nterm (hereafter simply called C).\nBy making use of the quantities defined in Section 2\nand of eq. (5), the clustering term in eq. (6) takes the form:\nC(\u03b8) =\n\n\u00112Z\n\nzmax\n\ndz b2eff (z)\n\nz(L\n\nmin ,Sd\n\n)\n\n2\njeff\n(z)\n(1 + z)4\n\n\u0010\n\ndx\ndz\n\n\u00112 Z\n\n\u221e\n\ndu \u03be(r, z),\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nwhere\njeff =\n\nZ\n\nmin[Lmax,L(S ,z) ]\nd\n\n\u03a6(L, z) K(L, z) L dlogL\n\n(8)\n\nLmin\n\nis the effective volume emissivity (see Toffolatti et al. 1998).\nFollowing the prescriptions of Section 2, we have then\nevaluated C(\u03b8) in eq.(7) separately for the three cases of\nlow-, intermediate- and high-mass objects, by plugging in\neq. (8) the appropriate expressions for the luminosity function. Note that in this case, the quantity b2 (Mmin , z) should\nindeed be read as b2 (Mmin , Mmax , z), where Mmax is the\nmaximum halo mass corresponding to the maximum visible bulge mass (i.e. upper limit for the mass locked into\nstars whose values are given in Section 2). This corresponds\nin eq.(3) to a replacement in the upper limit of the integrals\nof \u221e with Mmax .\nFigure 4 shows predictions for the correlation signal due\nto intensity fluctuations (in units ergs2 cm\u22124 Hz\u22122 sr\u22122 )\nin the case of SCUBA galaxies.

Note once again\nthe steep drop of all the curves around \u03b8 \u2243 1\u25e6 caused by the\nabsence of nearby sources of this kind and the very small\ncontribution given by the low-mass objects, mostly due to\ntheir small bias function and their modest contribution to\nthe effective volume emissivity.\nIn order to evaluate the total contribution of the clustering to intensity fluctuations one has to add up all the\nvalues of C(\u03b8) in eq.

Also the strongly negative K-correction increases their\ncontribution to the effective volume emissivity [eq. (8)] and\ntherefore to the fluctuations.\nWe therefore expect this effect to give a substantial contribution to the power spectrum extracted e.g. from the\nBOOMERanG map (de Bernardis et al. 2000) at 400 GHz.\nFor l >\n\u223c 200 its contribution may be comparable to that due\nto inhomogeneous emission by the interstellar dust.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have worked out predictions for the clustering properties\nof SCUBA-selected galaxies in the framework of an astrophysically grounded model, relating the formation of QSOs\nand spheroids (ellipticals, S0 galaxies and bulges of spirals).\nThe theoretical angular correlation function has been derived for different bias functions, corresponding to different values of the ratio Mhalo /Msph between the mass of a\nspheroid locked in stars and the mass of its host halo.\nSCUBA sources are predicted to be strongly clustered,\nwith a clustering strength which increases with increasing\nmass (or equivalently with increasing luminosity), as a consequence of the fact that they are very massive and shining at substantial redshifts. Since the clustering amplitude\nstrongly depends on the quantity Mhalo /Msph , future measurements of the angular correlation function w(\u03b8) will be\nable to discriminate amongst different models of SCUBA\n\ngalaxies and in particular to determine the amount of baryonic mass actively partaking the process of star formation.\nUnder the hypothesis of low- to intermediate-mass\nprimeval spheroids to show up in the optical band as LBGs\n(as argued by Granato et al. 2000), we have then compared\nour predictions with the clustering measurements obtained\nby Giavalisco et al. (1998) for a wide sample of LBGs at\nz \u2243 3. The agreement is good for a mass ratio between the\ndark halo and the stellar component in the range 10\u2013100;\nhigh values for this ratio seem to be favoured.\nAlso, the predicted amplitude of the angular correlation\nfunction of SCUBA galaxies is consistent with the one determined by Daddi et al. (2000) for EROs with R\u2212Ks \u2265 5.3\nand Ks \u2264 19.2. This would support the observational evidence for a substantial fraction of SCUBA galaxies to be\nidentified with EROs (Smail et al. 1999; Ivison et al. 2000).\nWe have also considered the effect of clustering on maps\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background at sub-mm wavelengths, with special attention to the 353 GHz (850 \u03bcm)\nchannel of the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) of the\nESA's Planck mission. The possibility of large fluctuations\ndue to clustering at this (and also shorter) wavelength was\nfirst pointed out by Scott & White (1999) who adopted\na phenomenological approach, assuming for SCUBA galaxies the clustering amplitudes observed for LBGs (Giavalisco\net al. 1996). Our treatment, leading to a derivation of\nthe angular autocorrelation function in the framework of\nthe currently standard hierarchical clustering scenario, indicates that massive SCUBA galaxies (expected to dominate\nthe population of sources sampled at fluxes S >\n\u223c 10 mJy)\nare likely to be even more strongly clustered than LBGs.\nThe corresponding fluctuations are then expected to be, at\n\u2243 350 GHz, of an amplitude comparable with those due to\nprimary CMB anisotropies for multipole numbers l > 50.\nThis would imply that important information on the clustering properties of faint sub-mm galaxies (and hence on their\nphysical properties such as their mass and/or the amount\nof baryons involved in the star-formation process) resides in\nthe BOOMERanG maps at 400 GHz where, however, the\ndominant signal is expected to come from interstellar dust\nemission. On the other hand, if the ratio Mhalo /Msph is large,\nwe expect the clustering signal to be comparable with dust\nemission fluctuations at l >\n\u223c 200. It might therefore be possible to separate these two contributions and possibly exploit\nthe different shapes of their power spectra.\nAs stressed by Scott & White (1999), the amplitude of\nthe clustering signal drops rapidly - in comparison to the\none arising from primary anisotropies - with decreasing frequency. In the nearest Planck/HFI channel (centered at 217\nGHz) its contamination on the CMB anisotropy maps should\nalready be negligible.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMauro Giavalisco is warmly thanked for providing us with\nthe data shown in Figure 3.
