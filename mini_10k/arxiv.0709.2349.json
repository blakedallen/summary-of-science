Swift can also provide multi-filter photometry in the UV-optical band. The source was clearly\ndetected in all observed energy bands, from the optical to TeV. With respect to previous observations the\nsource was in a low state in the very high energy (VHE) band (\u223c10% Crab flux above 300 GeV) but in\na relatively high state in the X-ray band. The light curves showed rather stable activities, with no significant variability in the VHE \u03b3-ray emission and small variability (\u223c 10% amplitude) in the X-ray band.\nThe observed spectral energy distribution in the steady state can be described by a one-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton model.\n\nIntroduction\nMultiwavelength observations of the BL Lac objects can provide information on the acceleration\nmechanism and the properties of the jet. Since the\nBL Lac objects are highly variable sources, simultaneous multiwavelength observations are essential tools to test the various emission models. At\npresent, it is unclear whether the observed emission is entirely due to accelerated electrons, as in\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models [e.g.][5],\nor whether the high-energy emission is due to secondary electrons produced by accelerated protons\nand ions [e.g.][12].\n1ES1959+650 (RA = 19:59:59.95, Dec = +65:08:54\n[J2000], z = 0.047) is categorized as a Highfrequency BL Lac object (HBL) where the\nsynchrotron peak lies in the X-ray regime [14].\nThe first TeV \u03b3-ray signal from this object was\nreported in 1998 [13]. Recent results from the\nobservations in 2004 with the MAGIC telescope\nshow a signal at the 8 \u03c3 level and a flux of about\n\n20% Crab (> 300 GeV) from 6.5 hours of observation [2]. This source is particularly interesting for\nmultiwavelength observations because a so-called\n\"orphan\" flare in TeV band without any X-ray\ncounterparts was observed in 2002. This activity\ncan not be explained by conventional one-zone\nSSC models [10].\n\nObservations\nMAGIC Observations\nThe MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) telescope is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) with a 17-m\ndiameter dish, located on the Canary Island of La\nPalma (28.2\u25e6 N, 17.8\u25e6 W, 2225 m a.s.l.). The telescope is operating at a \u03b3-ray trigger threshold of\n\u223c 50 GeV and a spectral threshold of \u223c100 GeV.\nThe telescope parameters and performance are described in detail in [3].\n\n\fMWL OBSERVATIONS FOR 1ES1959+650 WITH MAGIC AND S UZAKU /S WIFT\n\nCounts\n\n\u03b82 plot\n\nSuzaku Observations\n\n400\n350\n\n1ES1959+650 (z = 0.047)\n\u03b8 cut\n2\n\n300\n\n2006 May 21-27\nEffective observation time: 14.3 h\nzenith angle: 36-43.5 deg\n\n250\n\npreliminary\n\n200\n150\n100\n\nBackground events: 603 +- 14\nExcess events: 324 +- 34\n\n50\n0\n0\n\nExcess significance: 10.4 \u03c3\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n0.3\n2\n\u03b82 [deg ]\n\nFigure 1: \u03b82 distribution of 1ES1959+650 above\n350 photoelectron (corresponding to the \u03b3-ray\npeak energy of \u223c400 GeV) . A cut of \u03b82 <\n0.03 deg2 (dashed blue line) yields the signal\nof 324 events over 603 normalized background\nevents, corresponding to a 10.4 \u03c3 excess.\n1ES1959+650 was observed with the MAGIC telescope from 21st to 27th of May, 2006. The zenith\nangle during the observations was in the range\nfrom 36\u25e6 to 43.5\u25e6 . Observations were performed\nin wobble mode [6] with the object offset by 0.4\u25e6\nfrom the camera center. After the quality selection\nof the data the total effective observation time was\n14.3 hours. The analysis was performed using the\nstandard MAGIC analysis software. Details of the\nanalysis chain can be seen in [3]. In order to determine the significance of the \u03b3-ray signal and the\nnumber of excess events, a final cut with \u03b82 parameter was used. The \u03b8 is the angular distance\nbetween the source position in the sky and the reconstructed arrival position of the air shower which\nis estimated using \"DISP\" method [7]. A cut of\n\u03b82 < 0.03 deg2 yields an excess of 324 events over\n603 normalized background events, corresponding\nto a 10.4 \u03c3 excess as shown in figure 1. Only events\n> 350 photoelectrons were used, corresponding to\nthe peak of the energy distribution at about 400\nGeV for \u03b3-ray.\n\nSuzaku [11] is a X-ray satellite with four X-ray\nImaging Spectrometers (XIS) and a separate Hard\nX-ray Detector (HXD). The XIS are sensitive in\nthe 0.2-10 keV band with two types of CCDs composed of front-illuminated CCDs (for XIS0, 2 and\n3) and a back-illuminated type (XIS1). XIS1 is\nmore sensitive below 2 keV. The HXD is a silicon\nPIN diode array and is the most sensitive detector\nin the 10-70 keV band thanks to the good noise\nshielding.\nThe Suzaku satellite was pointing 1ES1959+650\nbetween 01:13:23 of May 23rd and 04:07:24 of\nMay 25th, 2006 (UT). The HXD/PIN light curve\nshows a rapid increase of the noise after about 100\nksec (possibly due to the in-orbit unexpected radiation 1 ) and the data after this event cannot be used\nfor the analysis. After screening the total net exposure time for XIS and HXD are 99.3 ksec and 40.2\nksec, respectively. According to the RXTE/ASM\nlight curve of May 2006 2 , the source was in a relatively high state during the Suzaku pointing.\n\nSwift Observations\nThe Swift satellite [8], with its easy and flexible\nscheduling, can be optimally employed for the observation of bright blazars. It carries three instruments. The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is optimized for 15-150 keV with high sensitivity while\nthe X-Ray Telescope (XRT) is sensitive in the 0.3 10 keV band. In addition a UV/optical telescope\ncan provide data in the 170-600 nm band. The\nsource was also observed with Swift around the\nSuzaku pointing 19th, 21st and from 23rd to 29th\nof May.\n\nResults and Discussions\nLight curves\nThe light curves in VHE \u03b3-ray and X-ray are\nshown in figure 2. The average integrated flux\nabove 300 GeV is (1.27 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(\u03c72 /d.o.f = 8.5/6), which corresponds to about 10%\n1. see http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/log/hxd/\n2. see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xte weather/\n\n\f30 TH I NTERNATIONAL C OSMIC R AY C ONFERENCE\n\nof the Crab Nebula flux [3].

The hardness ratio shows rather small\nspectral variation, except for a the sudden drop at\nt \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 105 s.\n\nIn figure 4 we report the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES1959+650 as measured at the\nend of May 2006, together with other historical\ndata [see the figure caption for the detailed information]. The absorption of VHE \u03b3-ray emission\nby the extra-galactic background light (EBL) are\ncorrected using \"Low model\" of [9].\nAssuming the uniform injection of the electrons\nthroughout a homogeneous emission region we\nmodel the observed SED by using a one-zone SSC\nmodel developed by [16, 17].

The\nsource was clearly detected in all observed energy bands. The results indicate that the activity\nof the source was rather stable. The VHE \u03b3-ray\nflux showed a low state of activity with about 10%\nCrab flux unit above 300 GeV and a photon index\nof \u22122.58 \u00b1 0.18. In the X-ray band the flux was\nrelatively high and only small variability (\u223c 10%)\ncan be seen. The SED with the simultaneous spectral data in the steady state can be well described\nby the one-zone SSC model.

We report the average Suzaku spectrum (red) and the swift spectra taken on May 24 [higher] and May 29 [lower].\nGreen points (filled circles) report the observed\nMAGIC spectrum, while the red points (empty\ntriangles) have been corrected for the absorption.\nHistorical data are taken from [14] (radio-opticalX-rays), [4, 10] (X-rays), and [1] (TeV). The line\nrefers to the best fit SSC model for the campaign\ndata in 2006 using the code developed by [16, 17].\nSee text for the fit parameters.\nat a relativistic speed \u03b2c with a bulk Lorentz factor \u0393 and the viewing angle of \u03b8. The beaming\n(Doppler) factor is given by \u03b4 = 1/[\u0393(1\u2212\u03b2 cos \u03b8)],\nwith \u03b4 \u223c \u0393 for \u03b8 \u223c 1/\u0393. The electron distribution is described by a smoothed broken power-law\nN (\u03b3) = K\u03b3 \u2212s1 (1 + \u03b3/\u03b3b )s1 \u2212s2 exp(\u2212\u03b3/\u03b3max)\nwhere K is a normalization factor, \u03b3b is the break\nLorentz factor of electrons, and s1 and s2 are the\nspectral indices below and above the break, respectively. The best fit SSC model was achieved using\nthe following parameters: \u03b4 = 35, R = 5 \u00d7 1015\ncm, B = 0.12 G, K = 2 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 , \u03b3min = 1,\n\u03b3b = 8 \u00d7 104 , \u03b3max = 7 \u00d7 105 , s1 = 2 and\ns2 = 3.5.\n\nSummary\nFor the first time, in May 2006, we successfully\nperformed simultaneous multiwavelength observations in the VHE \u03b3-ray, X-ray and optical-UV\n\nThe MAGIC collaboration thanks the IAC for the\nexcellent working conditions at the ORM.
