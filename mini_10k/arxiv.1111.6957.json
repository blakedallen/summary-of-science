However, computing total\ncross sections such as pp and\n\u221a p\u0304p cross sections in the\nlarge CM collision energy, s, remains an unresolved\nproblem in QCD. Unlike hard processes which can be\ncomputed in the perturbation theory, to compute the\ntotal cross section requires knowledge of the imaginary\npart of the forward elastic scattering amplitude, which\ninvolves the intrinsically nonperburative zero momentum\ntransfer physics. In the 60's and 70's Regge theory was\nextensively developed in attempts to understand hadron\ninteractions [1\u20133]1 . Even now one still cannot claim to\nhave an understanding of the total cross sections from\nfirst principles of QCD [4].\nWe recall the minijet model was first introduced in the\n70's [5]. At the time it was noticed that the rise of the\ntotal cross section was very similar to the jet production\ncross section. In this context, it is natural to separate\nthe total cross section into a soft component and a hard\ncomponent. Here the hard component is to be computed\nthrough the pQCD motivated minijet model. However,\nthe\n\u221a minijet cross section rises too rapidly with respect to\ns. Since then the minijet model has been incorporated\nin the eikonal model by various authors in attempts to\ntame the rise and explain the data quantitatively [6\u201312].\nIn this paper, we compute of minijet cross section using pQCD and demonstrate the taming of the rapid rise\nwithin the framework of QCD using the classical color\nfield modified amplitude. We find the modified mini-\n\njet model can qualitatively describe the total cross section\n\u221a over the entire range of the available data, i.e. from\ns = 5 GeV to 30 TeV.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In\nSec. II, we define the conventional minijet cross section\nand discuss its violation of the Froissart bound (FB).\nThen we present the classical color field modified minijet\nmodel in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we compare the present\nmodel with the data. Asymptotic behavior of the present\nmodel will also be discussed. This work is concluded in\nSec. V. Details on the derivation of the modified gg \u2192 gg\namplitude used in the present model can be found in [13].\nII.\n\nFollowing the soft and hard decomposition of the total\ncross section we write pp and p\u0304p cross sections as (see\nalso [11, 12])\n\u03c3pp = \u03c3sof t + \u03c3hard\n\u221a\n\u03c3p\u0304p = \u03c3sof t (1 + a/ s) + \u03c3hard\n\n\u2020\n1\n\nmfcheung@physics.utexas.edu\nchiu@physics.utexas.edu\nFor application of Regge theory in late 60's and the early 70's see\nthe two review articles [1, 2] and the book [3]. For more recent\ndiscussion on the Regge theory and its relation to QCD see the\nbook [4]. See also those references listed therein.\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nFor the soft component, we assume Regge theory is applicable. Here the dominant contribution is the Pomeron\nexchange with \u03b1P (0) = 1. So \u03c3sof t = const \u00d7 s\u03b1P (0)\u22121 =\nconst. The secondary Regge pole contribution is expected to be dominated by I = 0 exchange of the f and\n\u03c9 trajectories. We assume they are exchange degenerate\ntrajectories [14\u201317]2 with \u03b1f (0) = 1/2 and \u03b1\u03c9 (0) = 1/2.\n\n2\n\u2217\n\nMINIJET MODEL AND VIOLATION OF\nTHE FROISSART BOUND\n\nThe idea of exchange degeneracy was first introduced in [14].\nSoon after that, it was recognized the exchange of pairs of\nexchange-degenerate trajectories play a crucial rule in hadrons\ncollision phenomenology in intermediate energy region, especially\nin the context of direct-channel and crossed-channel duality. For\ninstance the presence of prominent low energy meson resonances\n\u221a\nin the p\u0304p channel is responsible for the presence of the 1/ s term\n\n\f2\n(Note that here the pomeron is associated with the soft\ncomponent contribution with \u03b1P (0) = 1. This differs\nfrom the pomeron used in [18]. The latter is associated\nwith both soft and hard contributions with an intercept\nat \u03b1P (0) = 1.08.)\nThe hard component has been associated with the\npresence of jets in the final state, where the inclusive jet\ncross section is assumed to be dominated by the minijet production contribution [5\u20137]. At high energy, the\ndominant minijet cross section comes from the gg \u2192 gg\nprocess and is given by:\n\u03c3mnj =\n\nZ\n\n1\n2t\u03020\ns\n\ndx1\n\nZ\n\n1\n2t\u03020\nx1 s\n\ndx2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212t\u03020\n\ndt\u0302\n\n\u2212\u015d+t\u03020\n\n\u00d7g(x1 , \u03bc2g ) g(x2 , \u03bc2g )Fmnj\n\nd\u03c3gg\n,\ndt\u0302\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the gluons from the two colliding protons. Fmnj\nis introduced as a generalization factor which will be elaborated in later sections. For the conventional minijet\nmodel, Fmnj = 1.

The parameter t\u03020 is the cutoff of the squared\nexchange momentum which defines the hard scattering\nscale below which reactions are considered to be soft.\nOne can verify that for large s the dominant contributions of the gg subprocess are from the terms with t\u0302 and \u00fb\nsingularities. The corresponding leading order diagrams\nare the one gluon exchange in t\u0302- and \u00fb-channel which\nlead to the approximation in eq. (4).\n|M |2 =\n\n9\n2\n\nViolation of the Froissart bound: To examine\nthe asymptotic behavior of \u03c3mnj , one can approximate\n\u03c3mnj by its most dominant contribution. Firstly, by peak\napproximate of the t\u0302 and \u00fb singularities, we replace all\nd\u03c3\nthe \u03bc2g by t\u03020 and dgg\n\u2192 9\u03c0\u03b1s (t\u03020 )/t\u03022 . Thus, the intet\u0302\ngral of t\u0302 is asymptotically s-independent. The integrand\nof eq. (3) in the small-x region dominates since g(x, \u03bc2g )\nincreases rapidly as x decreases. A conventional power\n\nin eq. (2). For the pp case,\n\u221a the lack of low energy resonances\nleads to the absence of 1/ s term in eq. (1). For discussions on\nexchange degeneracy and its relation duality see [15\u201317].\n\nlaw (PL) parametrization of g(x, \u03bc2g ) is g \u223c x\u2212J when x\nis small.

The distribution is a quadratic polynomial in ln(1/x) with quadratic polynomial coefficients in\nln Q2 . Explicitly, for 0 < x < 0.09, it reads\nxg F B (x, Q2 ) = \u22120.459 \u2212 0.143 ln Q2 \u2212 0.0155 ln2 Q2\n+[0.231 + 0.00971 ln Q2 \u2212 0.0147 ln2 Q2 ] ln(1/x)\n+[0.0836 + 0.06328 ln Q2 + 0.0112 ln2 Q2 ] ln2 (1/x).

Similar violation has been shown in neutrinonucleon deep-inelastic scattering [23]. In fact, the authors in [22] pointed out that one should not expect a\nleading order approximation to be constrained by Froissart bound [24].\n\nIII.\n\nMINIJET IN CLASSICAL COLOR FIELD\n\nIn the original minijet model, each incoming proton\nprovides a gluon undergoing elastic scattering in vacuum\nto produce the jets. For each subprocess, the rest of the\nprotons are treated as spectators. In contrast to this simple picture, we consider the effect due to the other gluons in the protons. In particular, the large x and small\nx gluons inside the protons are treated collectively as a\nclassical source and a classical color field, respectively,\nas in the color glass condensate (CGC) (for a recent review, see [25]). However, in this work, the classical field,\ninstead of being a degree of freedom in the problem, is\nconsidered as a prescribed background of which properties are characterized by the rapidity of the collinear\ngluons in the scattering. For a gg subprocess where the\nincident gluons have longitudinal momentum fraction x1\nand x2 , x1 and x2 define the separation scales between\nthe fast and slow gluons in the protons. Since x1 and x2\nare independent variables and, to the leading order, the\nsolution of the classical field is the superposition of the\nindividual field generated by each proton. The effect of\n\n\f3\nthe total classical field on the amplitude is expected to\nbe a product of the individual effect. First consider the\ngluon with x1 from the proton moving along the +z direction. The gluons in the proton with x > x1 are regarded\nas fast and treated as random classical color sources, \u03c11 ,\nmoving along the light-cones. The gluons with x < x1\nare treated as a classical color field, A, generated by the\nsource through the Yang-Mills equation. The field A can\nbe solved in terms of \u03c11 . (The same situation appears in\nthe other proton.) Therefore, the gluons are scattering\nin a background with classical color field instead of the\nvacuum.\nThe classical color field interacts with the quantum\ngluons, B, involved in the hard scattering process and\nmodifies the gg \u2192 gg amplitude. Due to the color neutrality assumption, the overall classical color field must\nbe zero, but the fluctuation can be finite. So the leading order contribution of the classical field to the amplitude is proportional to A2 ; therefore, B interacts at\nleast twice with A. The modified amplitude depends on\nA[\u03c11 ], in turn, the random sources \u03c11 . To obtain a physical amplitude, the amplitude must be averaged over the\nsource with a weight function W [\u03c11 ]. For that purpose,\nwe apply the Gaussian average of the IIM model [26]. Although the Gaussian average is an approximation to the\nfull renormalization group solution of the weight function, it captures the physics in both dilute and saturated\nregime.\nWe refer the reader to [13] for the detailed derivation\nof the modified gg \u2192 gg amplitude. Here we quote the\nresult of the modified amplitude. In particular, for the\nt\u0302 and \u00fb-channel one gluon exchange diagrams at high\nenergy, the propagator of the exchanged quantum gluon\nis modified while the vertex remained unchanged. The\nmodification to the propagator due to the proton moving\nto the +z direction to the leading order in the coupling\nand the classical field contains two terms.

The parameter L\u2212\nis the average longitudinal size of the source with x for\nx1 < x < 1. We defined L\u2212 = x1\u03c7P + . One can roughly\nestimate a reasonable value of \u03c7 for small-x and low Q2\nwith g(x, Q2 ).

So far, the minijet cross\nsection includes only the gg \u2192 gg contribution that is\nadequate for very high energy.

Consider the\nintegral of eq. (19) in the small x1 and x2 region where\nQ2s (x) becomes large. The dilogarithm Li2 (\u2212z) in eq.\n(12) is proportional to ln2 (z) for large |z|. So that the\npower law behavior of Q2s (x) leads to a logarithmic becl\nhavior of I(Q2 , x) \u221d ln(x) for small x.

This exchange gluon can be considered as\na probe of the protons. When the scattering involves\ncollinear gluons at small xs, many partons with a higher\nx value become a part of the source and the corresponding classical field increases. The exchange gluon has to\ninteract with the strong classical field before reaching the\ncollinear gluon. Throughout the process, the propagator\nacquires a suppressive factor which depends on x.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe minijet model was originally introduced based on\na striking resemblance between the rise of the total cross\nsection with energy and the rise of jet (dominated by\nminijet) cross section. In this work, we show that within\nthe framework of QCD, the interaction between the gluon\nand the classical color field can play an important role in\nunderstanding this rise.\nAmong different parameterizations of the gluon distribution function, we choose the one that is consistent to\nthe Froissart bound satisfying F2 derived in [22]. We first\nshow that, even with this distribution, the conventional\nminijet cross section still violates the Froissart bound.\nWe then apply the formalism of the gluon-classical\ncolor field interaction within the Gaussian approximation\nof CGC. In this formalism, to leading order in the coupling constant and the strength of the sources, we found\nthat the classical color field introduces a modification\ncl\nfactor Fmnj\nin the integrand of the minijet cross section\nthat leads to a suppression of the rate of the rise of the\ntotal cross section. This allows a good description of the\n\n\f6\n\nAlthough the complete solution of the classical color\nfield due to two colliding protons has not yet found, our\napproximated solution to the leading order in the source,\n\u03c1 and coupling g with Gaussian average illustrates a sig-\n\nnificant effect due to the quantum-classical interactions.\nIn the present model, the collinear factorization is assumed. In general, including the interaction with the\nclassical field from the approaching protons would break\nthe collinear factorization. However, in [13], we found\nthat the Feynman diagrams consisting of interactions between the collinear gluon and the classical field vanish.\nThe only correction to the gg \u2192 gg amplitude is of the\nform of eq. (18) which is factorisable. This justifies the\nfactorization assumption. Nevertheless, this factorization property is not guaranteed in the higher order calculation.\n\n[1] C. Chiu, Ann.
