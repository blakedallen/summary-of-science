While there has\nbeen much experimental and theoretical work in this direction in the last years,\nthe symmetry energy must still be considered as uncertain. Observables, which\nare sensitive to the isovector density dependence of the Equation-of-State (isoEoS) and testable experimentally, are still under investigation [1,2,3,4,5].\nThe symmetry energy Esym appears in the energy density\n\u01eb(\u03c1, \u03c13 ) \u2261 \u01eb(\u03c1) + \u03c1Esym (\u03c1) (\u03c13 /\u03c1)2 + O(\u03c13 /\u03c1)4 + ....,\n\n(1)\n\nexpressed in terms of total (\u03c1 = \u03c1p + \u03c1n ) and isospin (\u03c13 = \u03c1n \u2212 \u03c1p ) densities. The symmetry term has a kinetic contribution directly from basic Pauli\ncorrelations and a potential part from the highly controversial isospin dependence, as a function of the total nucleon density, of the mean field [4]. Both\nat sub-saturation and supra-saturation densities, predictions based on the existing many-body techniques diverge rather widely, see ref. [6]. However, the\ndominant quadratic dependence on the asymmetry parameter \u03b2 = (\u03c13 /\u03c1) =\n(N \u2212 Z)/A in Eq.(1) is well supported by the phenomenology (e.g. the mass\nformula) as well as by all microscopic nuclear many-body calculations [3]. We\nrecall that the knowledge of the EoS of asymmetric matter is very important\nat low densities ( e.g. neutron skins, pigmy resonances, nuclear structure at\nthe drip lines, neutron distillation in fragmentation, neutron star formation\nand crust) as well as at high densities ( e.g. neutron star mass-radius relation,\ncooling, hybrid structure, transition to a deconfined phase, formation of black\nholes).\nIt is attractive to take advantage of new opportunities in experiments (availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams, improved methods of measuring\nevent-by-event correlations) and theory (development of reliable microscopic\ntransport descriptions for heavy ion collision (HIC)) to obtain results which\nconstrain the existing effective interaction models. In this paper we will discuss\ndissipative collisions in the range of Fermi energies, which will yield information on the symmetry term around and below normal density. Here we focus\nour attention on the charge equilibration dynamics in peripheral collisions\nwhere we expect to see symmetry energy effects on the isospin transport.\nThe interesting feature at Fermi energies is the onset of collective flows due\nto compression and expansion of the interacting nuclear matter. The isospin\ntransport takes place in regions with density and asymmetry variations and\nthus we expect to have contributions to the isospin current from charge and\nmass drift mechanisms. It was shown [7], that these are determined by the\n2\n\n\fvalue and the density-gradient of the symmetry energy, respectively [7], which\nare then studied here at subsaturation densities. Fast (pre-equilibrium) nucleon emission, related to the symmetry energy via the different symmetry\npotentials seen by neutrons and protons, also influences the isospin content of\nthe Projectile-like and Target-like residues. Finally in the Fermi energy range\nwe have a substantial Intermediate Mass Fragment (IMF) production even in\nnon-central collisions and this will also affect the isospin dynamics. We will\ncarefully look at all these dynamical effects, trying to select observables which\nare sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry term.\nIsospin equilibration at intermediate energies and its relation to the symmetry energy has, in fact, attracted much attention in recent years in experiment\nas well as in theory [7,8,9,10,11]. We present here a detailed analysis of the\nvarious iso-transport mechanisms in connection to properties of the effective\nin-medium interactions. We try to disentangle effects due to the general reaction dynamics, ruled by isoscalar terms of the interaction, from genuine\nisovector contributions. This will allow us to suggest new observables particularly sensitive to the symmetry term of the EoS:\n(i) Correlation between the isospin equilibration of the reaction partners and\nthe total kinetic energy loss in binary events;\n(ii) The isospin content of IMF in break-up (ternary) events.\nIn Sect.2 we introduce our transport-theoretical approach to the reaction dynamics and the choice of the effective interactions investigated. In Sect.3 we\nshow results for binary events in Sn + Sn peripheral collisions at 50 AMeV, in\nSect.4 we discuss neck fragmentation events, and finally in Sect.5 we present\na summary and some perspectives.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical Description of the Collision Dynamics\n\n2.1 The Transport Model\nWe perform ab initio collision simulations using the microscopic Stochastic\nMean Field (SMF) model. It is based on mean field transport theory with correlations included via hard nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions and with inclusion\nof stochastic forces acting on the mean phase-space trajectory [4,12,13,14,15].\nStochasticity is essential in order to allow the growth of dynamical instabilities\nwith fragment production, as well as to obtain physical widths of distributions\nof observables. Moreover it will allow to perform event-by-event correlation\nstudies of great importance for the very complex reaction dynamics in this\nenergy regime.\n3\n\n\fThe transport equation for the phase space distribution function, with the\nPauli blocking consistently evaluated, is integrated following a representation\nin terms of test particles of finite widths [12,13]. A detailed description of\nthe procedure is given in ref. [4]. Our code [16] has been extended by the\nintroduction of momentum dependent mean fields (see next subsection), which\nare rather important in this energy range. It has also been possible to improve\nthe numerical accuracy while even reducing the computing times [17].\n\nA parametrization of free nucleon-nucleon cross sections is used, with isospin,\nenergy and angular dependence [18]. Low energy NN collisions, mostly forbidden because of the Pauli blocking, have large cross sections and could induce\nspurious effects in the presence of some numerical inefficiency in the blocking\nprocedure, due to the discretization of the phase space. In order to avoid such\nproblems a cutoff value \u03c3cut = 50mb is used in our calculations. A parallel\nensemble method is employed in the implementation of the collision term.\n\nFor discussions of isospin dynamics in this energy regime it is essential to have\na reliable procedure for fragment recognition, i.e. to identify the \"gas\" (emitted nucleons and light clusters) and the \"liquid\" (fragments, residues) phases.\nFragments are produced via instabilities in the expanding dilute matter and\nas residues of the initial colliding ions (in the case of non-central collisions).\nIn our transport simulations the fragment definition is performed by means\nof density cuts ; more precisely, a criterion of \u03c1 > \u03c1cut (with \u03c1cut between \u03c1/6\nand \u03c1/10) for the liquid, and correspondingly for the gas, is used. This procedure is applied in an event by event analysis at the \"freeze-out\", i.e. when\nthe resulting fragments are well separated in space and interacting only via\nCoulomb forces. We have checked that such \"final\" gas/liquid isospin properties are not depending on the choice of density cuts and freeze-out times, see\nSect.3.2. Nucleons can be emitted during the early stages of the reaction due\nto hard NN collisions as well as to repulsive potentials, during the fragment\nformation due to the isospin distillation effect, and finally from sequential decay of excited primary products (fragments/residues). The isospin is used in\nall these dynamical paths both as a tracer of the reaction mechanism, as well\nas an observable of interest with respect to the iso-EoS.\n\nWe follow the reaction dynamics only up to a \"freeze-out\" time. Fragments\nand residues will still be highly excited and will undergo sequential decays that\ncan modify the original isospin information related to the nuclear dynamics.\nHowever, we will analyze mainly quantities which are expected to change little\ndue to the late evaporative emission. \"Imbalance\" and \"Double\" Ratios have\nbeen suggested to that purpose [8,19,20], and will be discussed below.\n4\n\n\f2.2 Specification of Interactions\nWe adopt a generalized form of effective interaction, which can be easily reduced to Skyrme-like forces, with momentum dependent terms also in the\nisovector channel [17,21,22]. The general structure of this isoscalar and isovector Momentum Dependent (MD) effective interaction is derived via an asymmetric extension of the Gale-Bertsch-DasGupta (GBD) force [23,24,25,26],\nwhich corresponds to a Yukawian non-locality.\nThe energy density is parametrized as follows:\n\u03b5 = \u03b5kin + \u03b5A (A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ) + \u03b5B (B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ) + \u03b5C (C \u2032 , C \u2032\u2032 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5kin is the usual kinetic energy density and the potential terms are\n\n\u03b5A (A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ) = (A\u2032 + A\u2032\u2032 \u03b2 2 )\n\n\u033a2\n\u033a0\n!\u03c3\n\n\u033a\n\u033a\n\u03b5B (B , B ) = (B + B \u03b2 )\n\u033a0\n\u03b5C (C \u2032 , C \u2032\u2032 ) = C \u2032 (IN N + IP P ) + C \u2032\u2032 IN P\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 2\n\n\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nThe variable \u03b2 = (N \u2212Z)/(A) defines the isospin content or asymmetry of the\nsystem, given the number of neutrons (N), protons (Z), and the total mass\nA = N + Z; \u033a is the nuclear matter density (\u033a0 is the saturation value). The\nmomentum dependence is contained in the I\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 terms, which are integrals of\nthe form\nI\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 =\n\nZ\n\nd~p d~p \u2032 f\u03c4 (~r, ~p)f\u03c4 \u2032 (~r, p~ \u2032 )g(~p, ~p \u2032 ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03c4 = P, N, for protons and neutrons. Here f\u03c4 (~r, p~) are the nucleon phase\nspace distributions for protons and neutrons and the function g(~p, p~ \u2032 ) \u2261\ng[(~p \u2212 p~ \u2032 )2 ] determines the type of momentum dependence. A Skyrme-like\nmomentum dependence is obtained when we use the simple quadratic form\ng(~p, ~p \u2032 ) = (~p \u2212 ~p \u2032 )2 . A more general momentum dependence, in better agreement with phenomenological optical potentials, can be introduced by the function [23,24,25,26]\n\uf8ee\n\np~ \u2212 p~ \u2032\ng(~p, ~p \u2032 ) = \uf8f01 +\n\u039b\n\n!2 \uf8f9\u22121\n\uf8fb .\n\nWe remark that this form is particularly suitable for SMF simulations.\n5\n\n(5)\n\n\fFrom the energy density one derives the mean field potentials as U\u03c4 (~r, p~) =\n\u03b4\u03b5/\u03b4f\u03c4 . Thus the above energy density implies a momentum dependent mean\nfield interaction. The momentum dependence is isoscalar if the coefficients C \u2032\nand C \u2032\u2032 are identical and also it can have an isovector part, if they are different.\nThe isovector momentum dependence implies different effective masses for\n\u2217\n\u03c4 \u22121\nprotons and neutrons given as mm\u03c4 = (1 + ~m2 p \u2202U\n) .\n\u2202p\nWe note that the used form of the Momentum Dependent effective interaction,\nEqs.(2 - 5), is equivalent to the MDI force introduced in ref.[26]. The choice\nof the parameters is different: having fixed the isoscalar properties of the EoS\n(sof t symmetric matter KN M (\u03c10 ) = 215MeV , with nucleon effective mass\nm\u2217 /m = 0.67), we are exploring the dynamical effects of a different density\ndependence of the symmetry term, isovector part of the EoS, see Eq.(1).

In Fig.1 we show the density\ndependence for these two typical choices. We remark that this is the total\nsymmetry energy, with both potential and kinetic contributions.\nAt Fermi energies we have substantial density variations during the collision. In\nparticular during the expansion phase the system probes more dilute regions.\nThen we expect important effects on the isospin transport due to different\nsubsaturation values (larger for asy-soft) and to different slopes (larger for\nasy-stiff) of the symmetry energy. We will see that the transport coefficients\ndue to density and isospin gradients (usually called \"drift\", resp. \"diffusion\"\ncoefficients) will be affected in a different way and the final result will be\nsensitive to the choice of the two Esym shown in Fig.1.\nIn the framework of our parametrization of the effective interaction we can\nalso easily adjust the isospin momentum dependence to have the same den6\n\n\fFig. 1. Density dependence of the symmetry energies used in the simulations presented here: asy-soft (solid) and asy-stiff (dashed).\n\nsity dependence of the symmetry energy but opposite neutron/proton effective\nmass splittings. The ordering of the neutron/proton effective masses, which is\nalso related to the slope of the Lane potential with energy, is much debated\nin the literature [4,6]. E.g. one could have m\u2217n > m\u2217p as predicted by the early\nSkyrme forces [27] or the opposite as for the later Skyrme-Lyon parametrizations [28]. Thus one can, separately from the density dependence, study the\ncorresponding dynamical effects on nucleon emissions [17,21,22].\nThe effective mass splitting is increasing with density and it is relevant for the\ndynamics mainly at high momenta. Indeed, it has been shown that the effect on\nnucleon emission and flows can be observed only at high transverse momenta\n[17,21,22]. At the energies investigated here it is, however, a secondary effect,\nas the transport phenomena are mainly driven by the value and the slope of\nthe symmetry energy below saturation density. Thus, in order to simplify the\npresentation, we have fixed the isovector momentum dependence. The results\npresented here are obtained with the choice m\u2217n > m\u2217p . We have actually\nverified that the influence of the different mass splittings on the present results\non isospin transport is very small.\n\n2.3 Symmetry Potentials\n\nMany investigations have given definite evidence that the effective mean fields\nare momentum dependent, i.e. have an important isoscalar momentum dependence (see e.g. ref. [29]). Only in this way it was possible to explain the\ndependence with energy of the nucleon flow in heavy collisions. We have then\n7\n\n\fASY-SOFT, \u03b2=0.2\n\nASY-STIFF, \u03b2=0.2\n\n15\nMI\nMD, k=kF\nMD, k=2kF\n\nUsym (MeV)\n\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c1/\u03c10\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c1/\u03c10\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFig. 2.

Left panel: asy-soft choice; right\npanel: asy-stiff choice; MI interaction: dashed lines, MD interaction: solid (k = kF )\nand dotted (k = 2kF ) lines\n\nnaturally included a momentum dependence of the isoscalar interaction adjusted to these data, as discussed before. However, it is still of interest to\nsee the effects of such isoscalar momentum dependence on isospin transport\nphenomena, since this has also been an issue in earlier calculations [11], and\nhas not been looked at systematically so far. Thus in the following we will\nalso show results with Momentum Independent (MI) interactions along with\nthe Momentum Dependent (MD) ones, of course with parameters adjusted\nto the same saturation properties and symmetry terms. Details about the MI\ninteraction can be found in ref. [4].\nWe remark that the corresponding symmetry potentials, i.e. the effective field\nvariations seen by neutrons and protons in asymmetric matter, can be rather\ndifferent in the two frames, MI vs MD, and this could affect the isospin transport properties. So this point deserves some more attention.\nJust to have an idea of the expected transport effects we plot in Fig.2 the\nsymmetry potentials for asymmetry matter with \u03b2 = 0.2, the mean asymmetry of a 124 Sn isotope. We note that the momentum dependence, in fact,\nmodifies the effect of the stiffness of the symmetry term on the nucleon potentials. E.g. comparing the asy-soft vs. asy-stiff choices for neutrons and for MI\ninteractions, we see the general trend of a larger repulsion below saturation\nand a larger attraction above \u03c10 (and opposite for protons). It is also seen,\nthat the effect can be different in the MD case, though depending strongly on\nthe nucleon momenta. In this respect we remark that, in particular below the\nsaturation density, the differences become appreciable for nucleon momenta\naround 2kF , not much present in the Fermi energy range of interest here.\n8\n\n\fFig. 3. Density contours of a binary (upper panel) and a ternary (lower panel) event\nin the simulation of 124 Sn +124 Sn semiperipheral (b = 6f m) collisions at 50AM eV .\nA momentum dependent interaction (M D) has been used.\n\nAt variance a relevant overall effect of the Momentum Dependence is the\nreduction of the interaction times during the collision with an expected clear\ninfluence on the isospin diffusion. An important consequence is that in order\nto extract information on the density dependence of the symmetry term we\nare forced to select new observables related to the isospin equilibration that\nshould be not very sensitive to isoscalar properties of the effective interactions,\nlike the main momentum dependence. We will discuss in detail this point in\nthe next sections, suggesting very promising possibilities.\n\n3\n\nGeneral Features of the Isospin Transport in Peripheral Collisions\n\nIn this work we investigate peripheral collisions between similar systems with\ndifferent isospin, specifically collisions of different combinations of Sn isotopes.\nIn Fig.3 density contours of two typical examples of such events are shown,\none in the upper panel resulting in two heavy fragments and nucleons or\nlight clusters (binary event), and one in the bottom panel producing a third\nfragment of intermediate mass from the neck region between the two heavy\nresidues (ternary event, neck fragmentation ). We will discuss binary events in\nSect. 4, especially with respect to isospin equilibration between the residues,\nand ternary events in Sect. 5 with respect to the isospin content of the neck\nfragments.\n9\n\n\f3.1 Phases of the Reaction Mechanism\n\nThe reaction mechanism can be divided into different phases, which will be\nimportant for the following discussion:\n(i) Pre-equilibrium phase: the approach and early interaction phase is characterized by an emission of particles and light clusters (pre-equilibrium\nemission), which contributes to the \"gas\" phase. Of interest is the asymmetry of the gas, which has recently been discussed in detail in central\ncollisions in similar systems, in particular, with respect to ratios of produced particles and fragments [19,20].\n(ii) Transport phase: a neck of density below normal values develops between\nthe two heavy residues, the evolution of which is driven by the motion of\nthe spectators. During this phase isospin is transferred to the neck due\nto the density difference between the neck and the residues; this effect\nhas been called isospin migration (isospin drift), which leads to a more\nneutron-rich neck [30,31]. Moreover, in collision systems with different\nasymmetry, isospin is also transported through neck due to the N/Z\n\"concentration\" difference, leading to an equilibration of the isospin of the\nresidues (projectile- and target-like fragments; PLF/TLF). This has been\ncalled isospin diffusion. In asymmetric systems there is a competition\nof isospin migration and diffusion, which contains information on the\ncharacteristic time scales of the processes.\n(iii) Fragmentation into identified fragments (primary fragments): as in Fig.3\nwe distinguish two types of events, binary events with two heavy residues\nand the gas, and \"ternary\" events with an additional fragment of charge\nZ \u2265 3 and with mass between the masses of the residues and the gas, i.e.\nan intermediate mass fragment (IMF). Events with several IMF's are very\nrare at these energies and impact parameters and will not be considered.\n(iv) Evaporation stage: the primary fragments are considerably excited and\ndeexcite on the way to the detector, also changing their asymmetry. This\npart is not included in our dynamical model, but could rather be accessed\nwith statistical evaporation codes. This is not done here, because we\ntry to use observables, which are expected not to change substantially\nin the secondary evaporation. It should be kept in mind, however, that\nthe experimental \"gas\" also contains contributions from the evaporation\nstage.\n\n3.2 Freeze-out Times and Density Cuts\n\nIn the next sections we will present a detailed study of the isospin structure of\nthe reaction products analyzed at the freeze-out times, i.e. of the \"primary\"\n10\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.4\nasy-stiff, \u03c1cut=\u03c10/6\nasy-soft, \u03c1cut=\u03c10/6\n\n0.35\n\nasy-stiff, \u03c1cut=\u03c10/10\nasy-soft, \u03c1cut=\u03c10/10\n\n0.35\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b2gas\n\n\u03b2gas\n\n0.3\n\n0.15\n\n50\n\n100 150 200\nt (fm/c)\n\n50\n\n100 150 200\nt (fm/c)\n\n0.15\n\nFig. 4. Time evolution of the \"gas\" asymmetry in the simulation of 124 Sn +124 Sn\nsemiperipheral (b = 6f m) collisions at 50AM eV . Asy-soft: dashed lines. Asy-stiff:\nsolid lines. The panels correspond to different density cuts for the \"gas\" definition,\nsee text. A momentum dependent interaction (M D) has been used.\n\nnuclear systems (nucleons, clusters and fragments) emerging from the reaction\nregion. Here we would like to show that the extracted isospin information is\nreliable, i.e. not much dependent on not well defined parameters, like the choice\nof the freeze-out times and of the density cuts needed to separate the liquid\nand gas phases.\nIn Fig.4 we show the time evolution of the \"gas\" asymmetry averaged over 200\nevent simulations of the 124 Sn +124 Sn semiperipheral (b = 6f m) collisions at\n50AMeV , with the two choices of the symmetry stiffness (MD interactions).\nFrom the density contour plots of Fig.3 we see that the freeze-out time should\nbe between 150 and 200 fm/c. The flat behaviour of the gas asymmetry after\n150 fm/c clearly indicates that this quantity will not be much sensitive to a\nfreeze-out choice in that interval. Of course the same will happen to the liquid\nphase. The calculation has been performed using a \u03c10 /6 (left panel) and a\n\u03c10 /10 (right panel) density cut for the gas phase. We can see that almost\nidentical results can be obtained. An interesting point to note is the larger\nfinal gas asymmetry with the asy-soft choice. This is a combined effect of the\nneutron distillation during the fragment formation (which gives the crossing\nat around 70 fm/c) and of the larger repulsive potential below saturation, see\nFig.2.\nTab.

The nuclear interaction times are different for\nMD and MI interactions (shorter for MD) and this property of the isoscalar\ndynamics will certainly affect the isospin diffusion. In order to extract the\nrole of the isovector part of the interaction we have to single out observables\ndirectly related to the interaction times.\n\n3.3 Isospin Transport Coefficients\nAs already pointed out, in heavy ion collisions at Fermi energies isospin transport is due to the combined effect of asymmetry and density gradients. It can\nbe discussed in a compact way by means of the chemical potentials for protons\nand neutrons as a function of density \u03c1 and isospin asymmetry \u03b2 [7]. In fact,\nthe p/n currents can be expressed as\n\u03c1\n\u03b2\njp/n = Dp/n\n\u2207\u03c1 \u2212 Dp/n\n\u2207\u03b2\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c1\n\u03b2\nwith Dp/n\nthe mass, and Dp/n\nthe isospin transport coefficients, which are directly given by the variation of n, p chemical potentials with respect to density\nand asymmetry, see ref. [7]. In the literature these are often referred to as the\ndrift, resp. diffusion coefficients, and we will follow this convention here. Of\ninterest here is the differential current of neutrons and protons (iso-vector current) which has a simple relation to the density dependence of the symmetry\nenergy. In fact, from the rather general parabolic form of the symmetry term\nin the energy density, we obtain the important relation \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp = 4\u03b2Esym and\nderive the drift and diffusion contributions to the isovector current\n\n\u2202Esym\n,\n\u2202\u03c1\nDn\u03b2 \u2212 Dp\u03b2 \u221d 4\u03c1Esym .\nDn\u03c1 \u2212 Dp\u03c1 \u221d 4\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nThus the isospin transport due to density gradients, i.e. isospin migration,\ndepends on the slope of the symmetry energy, or the symmetry pressure,\nwhile the transport due to isospin gradients, i.e. isospin diffusion, depends on\n12\n\n\fthe absolute value of the symmetry energy. In peripheral collisions discussed\nhere, residues of about normal density are in contact with the neck region of\ndensity below saturation density. In this region of density a stiff iso-EoS has a\nsmaller value but a larger slope compared to a soft iso-EoS. Correspondingly\nwe expect opposite effects of these models on the migration and diffusion of\nisospin.\nIn our investigation we will see that the asy-soft choice appears to be more\neffective for isospin equilibration. This is the result of a dominant diffusion\nmechanism for peripheral collisions, together with a stronger fast neutron\nemission, which also contributes to the N/Z equilibration. With respect to\nthe pre-equilibrium emission we recall that in the asy-soft case neutrons see a\nmore repulsive symmetry potential around saturation, see Section 2.3. On the\nother hand, the asy-stiff choice is more effective for isospin migration, which\nwill be seen to be important for the isospin content of the neck fragments.\n\n3.4 The Imbalance Ratio\nWe will discuss the asymmetries of the various parts of the reaction system\n(gas, PLF/TLF's, and in the case of ternary events, IMF's ). In particular, we\nstudy the so-called imbalance ratio (also called Rami or transport ratio [32]),\nwhich is defined as\nx\nRP,T\n=\n\n2(xM \u2212 xeq )\n,\n(xH \u2212 xL )\n\n(8)\n\nwith xeq = 12 (xH + xL ). Here, x is an isospin sensitive quantity that is to be\ninvestigated with respect to equilibration. In this work we consider primarily\nthe asymmetry \u03b2 = (N \u2212 Z)/(N + Z), but also other quantities, such as\nisoscaling coefficients, ratios of production of light fragments, etc, can be of\ninterest [5]. The indices H and L refer to the symmetric reaction between the\nheavy (n-rich) and the light (n-poor) systems, while M refers to the mixed\nreaction. P, T denote the rapidity region, in which this quantity is measured,\nin particular the PLF and TLF rapidity regions. Clearly, this ratio is \u00b11 in\nthe projectile and target regions, respectively, for complete transparency, and\noppositely for complete rebound, while it is zero for complete equilibration.\nIn a simple model we can show that the imbalance ratio mainly depends on\ntwo quantities: the strength of the symmetry energy and the interaction time\nbetween the two reaction partners. Let us take, for instance, the asymmetry\n\u03b2 of the PLF (or TLF) as the quantity x. In the Fermi energy domain we can\ndescribe the charge equilibration dynamics as an overdamped dipole oscillation\nmode, see [33,34]. Therefore, as a first order approximation, in the mixed\n13\n\n\freaction the charge asymmetry parameter will show an exponential relaxation\ntowards its complete equilibration value, \u03b2eq = (\u03b2H + \u03b2L )/2 as\nM\n\u03b2P,T\n= \u03b2 eq + (\u03b2 H,L \u2212 \u03b2 eq ) e\u2212t/\u03c4 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere t is the time elapsed while the reaction partners are interacting (interaction time) and the damping \u03c4 is mainly connected to the strength of the\nsymmetry energy. In fact, as seen in Eq.(7), isospin diffusivity is directly proportional to the symmetry energy [7,10]. Inserting this expression into Eq.(8),\n\u03b2\none obtains RP,T\n= \u00b1e\u2212t/\u03c4 for the PLF and TLF regions, respectively.\nFrom this simple result one sees that the imbalance ratio does not depend on\nthe difference of asymmetries (\u03b2H \u2212\u03b2L ) of the systems considered, at least at a\nfirst order level, which is due essentially to the normalization to the difference\n(\u03b2H \u2212 \u03b2L ) in the definition of R in Eq.(8). Hence the imbalance ratio can be\nconsidered as a good observable to trace back the strength of the symmetry\nenergy from the reaction dynamics. We will show that the effect of different\niso-EoS choices on the final imbalance ratios are measurable, in particular,\nwhen correlated to the total energy loss of the dissipative collision, which sets\nthe time-scale of the process.\n\n4\n\nBinary Reactions\n\nIn this section we discuss binary reaction events, and investigate the asymmetries of the various reaction components, i.e. of the gas, the residues, and\nthe exchanged particles, as well as the imbalance parameter derived from\nthese via Eq.(8). We will consider these quantities for the different isovectorEoS's, and for momentum-dependent (MD) and momentum-independent (MI)\nparametrizations of the isoscalar part, see Sect. 2.2. The aim of the analysis\nis also to show that effects due to the Momentum-Dependent term of the nuclear interaction are relevant for the reaction mechanism at Fermi energies,\nand consequently for the isospin equilibration. Here we discuss these quantities as a function of the incident energy and impact parameter, in the Sect.4.3\nwe will introduce the more significant correlation to the kinetic energy loss.\n4.1 Asymmetries of Reaction Components\nWe first investigate the behaviour of the asymmetries \u03b2 of the reaction components for the different Sn + Sn reactions for the impact parameters b = 6, 8,\nand 10f m and for two incident energies. We present our results for an incident\nenergy of Elab = 50AMeV for the gas phase in Fig.5, for the residues in Fig.6,\n14\n\n\fmixP, stiff\nmixT, stiff\nmixP, soft\nmixT, soft\n124, stiff\n124, soft\n112, stiff\n112, soft\n\n0,4\n\n0,4\n\n0,3\n\n0,2\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n\n\u03b2gas\n\n\u03b2gas\n\n0,3\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\nFig. 5. Asymmetries of the gas in Sn + Sn collisions at incident energy of\nE = 50AM eV for MD (left) and MI (right) interactions for a stiff (solid lines)\nand soft (dashed lines) iso-EoS. The symbols differentiate the different reaction systems: mixed PLF (full triangle up), mixed TLF (empty triangle down), symmetric\nheavy (full squares), symmetric light (empty, circles ). Thin horizontal lines denote\nthe initial asymmetries of the heavy and light system, respectively.\n\nand for the exchanged particles in Fig.7. These figures are arranged in an\nanalogous way: the results with the momentum dependent interaction (MD)\nare in the left panel, those with the momentum-independent one (MI) on the\nright. Results for the stiff and soft iso-EoS are given by solid and dashed lines,\nrespectively. The symbols distinguish the different systems: mixed HL reaction PLF (triangle up, full), TLF (triangle down, empty), symmetric heavy\nHH (squares, full) and light LL ( circles, empty) systems. Thus, also for the\ngas we have separated the emitted particles according to their origin from the\nprojectile (P) or target (T). The asymmetries of the exchanged particles are\nonly given for the mixed system. The initial asymmetries of 124 Sn and 112 Sn\nare indicated as horizontal lines.\nWe first note the following general properties of these asymmetries, which will\nbe valid for all cases discussed in the following. Of course, all these asymmetries\nare connected by charge conservation. In absolute numbers the mass of the\nexchanged particles changes from about 20 to 5 amu, and for the gas from\nabout 40 to 20 amu, for b = 6 to 10f m, respectively.\n\u2013 The gas (Fig. 5) is generally more n-rich (i.e. asymmetric) than the initial\n15\n\n\f0,2\n\n0,2\n\nmixP, stiff\nmixT, stiff\nmixP, soft\nmixT, soft\n124, stiff\n124, soft\n112, stiff\n112, soft\n\n0,15\n\u03b2Res\n\n\u03b2Res\n\n0,15\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\nFig. 6.

The arrangement of the\nfigure and the meaning of the lines and symbols is as in Fig.5.\n\nasymmetry of the corresponding nucleus; always for the n-rich nucleus (P)\nbut mostly also for the n-poor (less n-rich) system (T). In a nuclear medium\nwith neutron excess the interaction is more repulsive for neutrons, such that\nthese are emitted preferentially.\n\u2013 The asymmetry of the residues (Fig.6) for the mixed HL system decreases\nfor the n-rich (PLF) and increases for the n-poor (TLF) partner with respect to the initial asymmetries, as expected for isospin equilibration. It is\ninteresting to look closer at the residue asymmetry \u03b2Res in the case of the\nHH and LL symmetric collisions. Here we cannot have isospin transport\nand the only variations come from nucleon emissions. The asymmetry decreases for the symmetric systems from the initial asymmetry, less evident\nin the n-poor system, in correspondence with the asymmetry of the gas.\nThe change in the asymmetries of the residues of the mixed HL systems is\nmuch bigger than in the symmetric systems, indicating the importance of\nthe transport contributions to the isospin current. This is also supported by\nthe dependence on the iso-EoS discussed below.\n\u2013 In the mixed HL system neutrons are predominantly exchanged from the\nn-rich to the n-poor system, i.e. the asymmetry of the exchanged particles in\nthis direction is much larger than the initial asymmetry of the n-rich system.\nIn the other direction the asymmetry is close to the initial asymmetry.\n16\n\n\f0,4\n\n0,3\n\nPT, stiff\nTP, stiff\nPT, soft\nTP, soft\n0,3\n\n0,2\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03b2PT,TP\n\n\u03b2PT,TP\n\n0,4\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\nFig. 7. Asymmetries of the exchanged particles in the collision 124 Sn +112 Sn at\nincident energy of E = 50AM eV for MD (left) and MI (right) interactions, and\nfor the stiff (solid lines) and soft (dashed lines) iso-EoS, respectively. PT denote\nparticles transferred from the projectile to the target (triangle up, full), and vice\nversa for TP (triangle down, empty).\n\n\u2013 The impact parameter dependence clearly shows that iso-EoS effects are\nmore relevant for more dissipative collisions, i.e. for smaller impact parameters and thus for longer interaction times. This suggests the use of an event\nselection in terms of the total kinetic energy loss in order to enhance the\nsensitivity to the symmetry energy, as discussed in Sect.4.3.\nNext we note the differences when using the MD or MI interactions in the\nisoscalar sector. It is seen that the gas is generally more symmetric for a\nMD interaction. The MD interaction has a stronger isospin-blind repulsion,\nwhich emits protons and neutron equally. Thus the mass of the emitted gas\nis about 5 to 10 units higher in the MD case. This reduces the relative effect\nof the isovector interaction. Correspondingly, the residues are generally more\nsymmetric for the MI relative to the MD case since more of the neutron excess\nis emitted into the gas. In addition, in the MD case the reaction proceeds more\nrapidly, because of the greater isoscalar repulsion, thus reducing the interaction\ntime and reducing the amount of isospin equilibration. This is seen clearly in\nthe mixed systems.\n17\n\n\fWith respect to different iso-EoS's we see that the gas is more asymmetric\nfor the asy-soft case, which is expected because of the higher sub-saturation\nsymmetry energy and thus the larger neutron repulsion. Consequently the\nresidues are more symmetric for the soft iso-EoS both for the symmetric and\nthe mixed systems. Also, the change of the asymmetries of the residues is much\nlarger for the mixed (HL) than for the symmetric systems, indicating that\nisospin equilibration will be mostly sensitive to the iso-EoS via the transport\ncontributions of the isospin current. In the exchanged particles we see almost\nno effect for the particles transferred in the direction projectile to target, and\nan interesting difference in the other direction. This is due to the fact that,\nin the direction from projectile to target, the larger isospin diffusion effects\nexpected for the asy-soft EoS are counterbalanced by the more neutron-rich\nemission to the gas, which reduces the projectile asymmetry. On the other\nhand, diffusion effects act in opposite direction for the n-poor source, with a\nsmaller transferred asymmetry from target to projectile in the asy-soft case,\nalso due to the larger neutron emission to the gas. Thus in this direction we\ndo expect a sensitivity to the iso-EoS, as seen in Fig.7.\nHowever, we have to note that generally the changes due to different isovector EoS's are not very large. As we will see below, the imbalance parameter\nconsiderably increases the sensitivity, since the transport contributions will\nbe enhanced. In fact, it was shown in ref. [7] that the transport ratios depend mostly on (\u03b2P T \u2212 \u03b2T P ). i.e. the asymmetry difference of the exchanged\nnucleons, and less on pre-equilibrium emissions.\nFinally in Fig.8 we compare (for the case of MD interactions) the residue\nasymmetries for incident energies of 50 AMeV (left panel, already shown in\nFig.4) and 35 AMeV (right panel). Competing effects are observed, since on\none hand the emission to the continuum is lower at the lower energy, leading\nto less change of the initial asymmetry, and on the other hand, the interaction\ntime is larger, leading to more equilibration in the mixed system.\n\n4.2 Isospin Imbalance Ratios\n\nFrom the asymmetries shown before one obtains the imbalance ratios according to Eq.(8). These measure the amount of isospin equilibration in the mixed\nrelative to the symmetric reaction systems, having lower absolute values for\nmore equilibration.\nThe results for the imbalance ratios are shown in Fig.9 for the incident energy\nof 50 AMeV (left panel) and 35 AMeV (right panel), for MI/MD interactions and different iso-EoS choices. Two very clear trends with respect to the\namount of equilibration appear: the equilibration is larger (RP smaller) both,\n18\n\n\fmixP, stiff\nmixT, stiff\nmixP, soft\nmixT, soft\n124, stiff\n124, soft\n112, stiff\n112, soft\n\n0,2\n\n0,18\n\n0,16\n\n0,16\n\n0,14\n\n0,14\n\n0,12\n\n0,12\n\n\u03b2Res\n\n\u03b2Res\n\n0,18\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\nFig. 8.

In\nboth cases this can be understood from the fact that the reaction is slower\nand thus the interaction time longer, leading to more equilibration; for the\nlower energy because of the lower speed, and for the MI interaction because of\nthe less repulsive isoscalar mean field. In comparing the two iso-EoS's we see\nthat the equilibration is larger for the soft iso-EoS, since the higher symmetry\nenergy leads to a larger diffusion contribution to the isospin current, as discussed above. The first two effects (incident energy and MD interactions) are\nessentially kinematical, depending on the interaction time, while the last one\ndepends on the iso-EoS, which is of interest here. Thus, in the next section we\nwill propose a scheme to separate the kinematical from the isospin effects.\nThe results in Fig.9 can be compared to other results in the literature. In\nour previous work [7] we have used MI interactions and slightly different\nparametrizations of the iso-EoS, with a somewhat softer symmetry term. The\nresults here agree well with the previous ones within these variations.\nOn the other hand, there has been extensive discussion of isospin imbalance\nratios in several papers of B.A. Li and collaborators [11], in which a different\nfamily of iso-EoS's has been used, which is characterized by an index x (for the\ndensity dependence of the symmetry energy around saturation of the form \u03c1\u03b3 ),\ntogether with momentum-dependent interactions, and with free and mediummodified cross sections. The case x = \u22121, corresponding to \u03b3 \u2248 1, and with\n19\n\n\fMD, stiff\nMD, soft\nMI, stiff\nMI, soft\n\n0,5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0,5\n\nRP,T\n\nRP,T\n\n0,5\n\n-0,5\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\nb (fm)\n\n10\n\nFig. 9.

However, the value given in ref. [11] for b = 6f m of RP \u2248 0.42 does\nnot agree well with our value of RP \u2248 0.25 in Fig.9. The reason could reside\nin ingredients of the BUU transport code used (point test particles, surface\neffects) leading to a different treatment, relative to the SMF simulations here,\nof the isoscalar part of the nuclear interaction. This will influence, in turn,\nthe interaction time between the two reaction partners and the degree of\ndissipation reached in the collision.\nThe existing imbalance ratio measurements for Sn isotopes have been analyzed\nwith an impact parameter selection performed in terms of charged particle\nmultiplicities [8]. A value RP \u2248 0.45 is extracted in the impact parameter\nrange of b = 6\u22127.3f m, which is also not far from our asy-stiff MD estimations\n(\u03b3 = 1 or slightly stiffer). From Fig.9 (left panel) we see that in this impact\nparameter range the imbalance ratio RP is rapidly increasing and so it is very\nimportant to assess the same centrality selection in the comparison between\ndata and simulations. To overcome these problems and isolate isospin effects,\none could study the imbalance ratio directly as a function of the interaction\ntime (or an observable directly related to it), as we will do in the next section.\n20\n\n\f4.3 Correlation with Kinetic Energy Loss\nIn subsection 4.1 we have noted, e.g. in Fig.6, that the residues appear more\nsymmetric for the momentum-independent interaction. Also, we observe in\nFig.8 that at lower energy the longer equilibration time is counterbalanced\nby the smaller pre-equilibrium emission. These trends are more clearly seen\nin Fig.9 for the imbalance ratio, which directly measures the amount of equilibration. In fact the latter is clearly less effective when either the incident\nenergy is higher or momentum-dependent interactions are used. As we have\nremarked, both effects decrease the contact time of the two nuclei in the binary collision. Thus these observations point to the interaction time as the\ndominating influence on the amount of isospin equilibration, as was already\ndiscussed in ref. [7].\nOn the other hand, longer interaction times should be correlated with larger\ndissipation and, in particular, with damped PLF and TLF velocities. The\ndissipation, in turn, has been measured, e.g. in deep inelastic collisions, by the\nkinetic energy loss. Thus in this subsection we will investigate the correlation\nbetween the imbalance parameter and the kinetic energy loss. We define the\nkinetic energy loss per particle as\nEloss = Ecm \u2212\n\nCoul\nEkin + Epot\nElab AP AT\n, Ecm =\n,\nAP LF + AT LF\nAP (AP + AT )2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere AP , AT , AP LF , AT LF are the masses of the initial projectile and target,\nand of the final projectile-like and target-like fragments, respectively. Here\nEcm is the initial energy, per nucleon, available in the cm system. Ekin and\nCoul\nEpot\nare the final kinetic energies of the fragments in the cm system, and the\nCoulomb potential energy, respectively. We will use the relative energy loss\nEloss /ECM as a measure of PLF/TLF velocities and thus of the interaction\ntime. The study of isospin equilibration as a function of the heavy residue\nexcitation energy (related to the kinetic energy loss ) was also suggested in\nref. [9].\nThe relative energy loss is shown in Fig.10 (left panel) as a function of impact\nparameter for the two incident energies and MD, resp. MI interactions. It\nis seen that this quantity exhibits, generally, a very good correlation with\nimpact parameter, except for the large impact parameters, where eventually\nall curves will converge to zero. As expected the energy loss at a given impact\nparameter is larger for lower energies and for MI interactions, because of the\nlonger interaction times.\nHowever, the energy loss consists not only in internal excitation of the residues\nbut also in kinetic energy of the particles emitted to the gas.

Curves are shown for MD interactions (solid lines and circles) and MI interactions (dashed lines and squares), and for 35 MeV (open symbols) and 50 MeV (full\nsymbols) incident energy, respectively.\n\ngas is shown in the right hand panel of Fig.10 as a function of the relative energy loss. One sees that the mass loss (and correspondingly the energy loss) to\nthe gas is relatively independent of incident energy for MD interactions (black\ncurves), while there is a larger difference for the MI interactions (grey/red\ncurves). Since the energy lost into the gas is not necessarily closely related to\nthe interaction time, this represents a correction to the correlation between\ninteraction time and energy loss, which is discussed below.\nIn Fig.11 we present the imbalance ratio as a function of the relative energy\nloss. In the upper panel we separate the results for MD and MI interactions\nand stiff and soft iso-EoS, but in each case the results for 35 and 50 MeV\nare collected together and connected by lines. In contrast to Fig.9 we now\nsee that the points for the different incident energies approximately fall on\none line, however with considerable scatter around it. The deviations from a\nsmooth behaviour are larger for the MI interactions (diamonds and triangles).\nThis can be traced back to the observation, made above, that in this case\nthe pre-equilibrium emission, i.e. the energy loss to the gas, is rather different\nfor the two beam energies, while this is not so much the case for the MD\ninteraction. Considering that the pre-equilibrium emission is not a measure of\n22\n\n\fRP,T\n\n0,5\n\nstiff, MD\nsoft, MD\nstiff, MI\nsoft, MI\n\n0\n\n-0,5\n\nRP,T\n\n0,5\nstiff\nsoft\nstiff, fit\nsoft, fit\n\n0\n\n-0,5\n\n0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n0,4\nEloss/ECM\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\nFig. 11.

Upper panel: Separately\nfor stiff (solid) and soft (dashed) iso-EoS, and for MD (circles and squares) and MI\n(diamonds and triangles) interactions, in the projectile region (full symbols) and\nthe target region (open symbols). Lower panel: Quadratic fit to all points for the\nstiff (solid), resp. soft (dashed) iso-EoS.\n\nthe interaction time, this introduces a correction to the values obtained for 35\nMeV relative to those at 50 MeV, which tends to make the dependence more\nsmooth. We do not attempt, however, to make this correction quantitative,\nbecause this would amount to separating the gas particles into pre-equilibrium\nand evaporation components.\nIt is seen in Fig.11 that the curves for the asy-soft EoS (dashed) are generally\nlower in the projectile region (and oppositely for the target region), i.e. show\nmore equilibration, that those for the asy-stiff EoS. In order to emphasize\nthis trend we have, in the lower panel of the figure, collected together all the\nvalues for the stiff (circles) and the soft (squares) iso-EoS, and fitted them by\na quadratic curve. It is seen that this fit gives a good representation of the\ntrend of the results.\nThe difference between the curves for the stiff and soft iso-EOS in the lower\npanel then isolates the influence of the iso-EoS from kinematical effects associated with the interaction time. It is seen, that there is a systematic effect of\nthe symmetry energy of the order of about 20 percent, which should be measurable. The correlation suggested in Fig.11 should represent a general feature\n23\n\n\fof isospin diffusion, and it would be of great interest to verify experimentally.\nAs discussed above, this kind of analysis would help also in the comparison\nwith the results of other theoretical models.\nOn the other hand, it is also seen that the effect is not extremely large, in view\nalso of the substantial scatter of the points around the curves. Thus it is still\nof interest to investigate other observables, which might show more sensitivity\nto the iso-EoS. This will be done in the next section with respect to ternary\nevents.\n\n5\n\nTernary Reactions\n\n5.1 Characterization of Intermediate Mass Fragments\nAs discussed above, and seen in the example of Fig.3, there are peripheral\nevents in which a third intermediate mass fragment (IMF) appears. The term\n\"neck fragmentation\" has been coined for such events, see [35] and refs. therein.\nRelated isospin transport studies have been performed theoretically for symmetric reactions [7] and theoretically and experimentally for asymmetric collisions [31,36]. The asymmetry and the kinematical properties of the IMF\nwere shown to carry additional information on the symmetry energy. Here we\ninvestigate this information more in detail in the system under study.\nIn such reactions the asymmetry of the IMF is of particular interest. In symmetric systems it is a result of isospin migration, due to density gradients\nbetween the residues and the dilute neck. In mixed systems this effect is in\ncompetition with the isospin diffusion discussed in the last section due to concentration gradients. While the study of this competition may yield further\ninformation on the time scales of these different processes, the more pure case\nwill be the study of the symmetric systems.\nWe start with characterizing the origin of the IMF's. As an example in Fig.12\nwe display various properties of IMF's from the mixed reaction 124 Sn+112 Sn at\n50 AMeV and an impact parameter of b = 6f m for the stiff (solid histogram,\nblack symbols) and soft (dotted, grey/red ) iso-EoS. In the upper left panel\nthe charge distribution is displayed, exhibiting a broad distribution around\ncharge Z \u2248 8, which is not very different for different iso-EoS's. The upper\nright panel shows the times at which the third fragments are identified in\nour method. It is seen that they appear rather late and in a rather short time\nspan. The lower left panel displays the asymmetry of the IMF's as a function of\ntheir charge (later we will only show the average asymmetry). This asymmetry\ndistribution is rather flat; it is, however, substantially different depending on\n24\n\n\fFig. 12. Properties of Intermediate Mass Fragments (IMF) in the reaction\n124 Sn +112 Sn at 50 AM eV and b = 6f m for the stiff (solid lines and black symbols)\nand soft (dotted lines, grey/red symbols) iso-EoS: (upper left) charge distribution;\n(upper right) time of appearance of IMF; (lower left) asymmetry distribution of\nIMF's; (lower right) velocity correlation of IMF with respect to PLF (r) and TLF\n(r1), where r is the ratio of the relative IMF-residue velocity to the Viola systematics\nvelocity.\n\nthe iso-EoS [30]. Finally in the lower right panel we show velocity correlations\nbetween the fragments and the residues, as it was suggested in ref. [31] (socalled Wilczynski-2 plot). The quantity r is the ratio of the relative velocity of\nthe IMF and the PLF to the Viola systematics velocity, which corresponds to\nfission-like events, and r1 is the same quantity with respect to the TLF. A value\nof 1 signifies a late, statistical origin of the IMF, while values substantially\ndifferent from one indicate an IMF of dynamical origin, which is clearly the\ncase here. Altogether the information in this figure then suggests that the\nIMF's come from a uniform source, which can be identified with the neck\nregion.\n5.2 Isospin Dynamics with Fragment Production\nWe have looked at the asymmetries of the various reactions parts (gas, residues\nand exchanged particles, like in Figs.5, 6 and 7) also for the ternary events.\nIt could be expected that these are different from those of binary events,\n25\n\n\fmix, stiff\nmix,soft\n124, stiff\n124, soft\n112, stiff\n112, soft\n\n0,2\n\n\u03b2IMF\n\n\u03b2IMF\n\n0,2\n\n0,15\n\n0,15\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n8\n\n6\n\n8\n\n6\n\nb (fm)\n\nb (fm)\n\nFig. 13. Asymmetries of IMF's in ternary Sn+Sn reactions at 50 AMeV as a function\nof impact parameter for MD (left panel) and MI (right panel) interactions: symmetric 124+124 (squares), symmetric 112+112 (diamonds), mixed 124+112 (circles);\nstiff iso-EoS (solid lines), soft iso-EoS (dashed lines). Horizontal thin lines denote\nthe asymmetries of 124 Sn, mixed reaction and 112 Sn, respectively.\n\nbecause some of the isospin is carried away by the IMF. However, we find that\nthe differences are very small and thus we do not show these figures separately.\nThe relatively small mass of the IMF's thus does not substantially influence\nthe asymmetry of the main reaction products.\nA quantity which is very sensitive to the iso-EoS is the asymmetry of the\nIMF. It is shown in Fig.13 at 50 AMeV for the MD (left panel) and MI (right\npanel) interactions, separately for the symmetric and the mixed reactions. The\nasymmetry of the IMF is larger, i.e. the IMF is more n-rich, for the stiff relative\nto the soft iso-EoS, since the former exhibits a larger isospin migration due to\nthe larger slope of the symmetry energy below saturation. This is clearly the\ncase for the symmetric reactions, but it is also true for the mixed reactions,\nwhere there is a competition with isospin diffusion, which depends on the value\nof the symmetry energy and it is larger for the soft iso-EoS. Our result then\nshows that the isospin migration is the dominating effect for the asymmetry\nof the neck fragments.\nOne may now think to investigate the imbalance ratio for the asymmetry of the\nIMF, i.e. the ratio in Eq.(8) where the quantity x represents the corresponding\naverage asymmetry of the IMF's independent of their rapidity. As was already\nseen in ref. [30], this quantity is always found to be close to zero. This means\nthat the asymmetry of the IMF in the mixed reaction is the average of that in\nthe symmetric reactions. This is expected around mid-rapidity for symmetry\nreasons, although the IMF-asymmetries for all the systems, HH, LL and\n26\n\n\fHL, are different from the initial values. This is then approximately still true\nfor all the neck fragments. In fact we note that the IMF asymmetries for all\nsystems are changing in the same direction, increasing with the stiffness of the\nsymmetry term. This is a non-trivial condition for the almost zero imbalance\nratio of the neck fragments.\nHowever, a very striking feature seen in Fig.13 is the fact that the difference\nbetween the IMF-asymmetry for the stiff and the soft iso-EoS's is large, and\nin addition, that it is much larger in the case of MD interactions relative to\nMI interactions (difference between solid and dashed lines in the two panels,\nfor each colliding system). The large sensitivity of the IMF asymmetry to\nthe iso-EOS was already noted earlier [30] for MI interactions, showing the\neffectiveness of isospin migration for a stiff iso-EoS.\nAn interesting point which deserves a deeper interpretation is that the iso-EoS\neffect appears even more prominent for MD interactions. We see that \u03b2IM F\nincreases for the asy-stiff case (solid lines) and decreases for the asy-soft one\n(dashed lines) for MD relative to MI interactions. Therefore the differences\nin the predicted IMF-asymmetries for different iso-EoS's are systematically\nenhanced. This can be traced back to the following effect of MD interactions:\nthe reaction is faster and so we obtain a mid-rapidity neck fragment only in\nregions with larger projectile-target overlaps. Thus, for a given impact parameter the IMF is produced in a more compact configuration, i.e. with a larger\ninterface with the spectators [37] near normal density, where the asy-stiff EoS\nis effective with respect to neutron migration to the neck, while the asy-soft\nis not, due to the low value of the derivative of the symmetry energy close to\nnormal density (see Fig.1). In conclusion, with MD interactions we see a more\nprominent iso-EoS effect with a strong n-enrichment of the neck fragments\nonly for the asy-stiff case.\n\n5.3 Asymmetry Ratios\n\nIt is of interest to construct an observable, which quantifies these effects and\nwhich does not depend sensitively on measuring the absolute asymmetries,\nwhich are changed by the secondary evaporation. Considering that the asymmetries of the other reaction products (residues and the gas) is not equally\nsensitive to the iso-EoS (see Figs.5 and 6 ; which are for binary events, but, as\nstated above, do not change noticeably for ternary events), it is attractive to\nlook for ratios of asymmetries. In Fig.14 we show the ratio of the asymmetries\nof the IMF's to those of the residues for the symmetric Sn + Sn reactions for\nstiff (solid) and soft (dashed) iso-EoS, and for MD (circles) and MI (squares)\ninteractions. The results correspond to b = 6f m semiperipheral events, plotted\nhere as a function of the initial isospin asymmetry of the colliding system.\n27\n\n\f1.35\n1.3\n\n\u03b2IMF/\u03b2Res\n\n1.25\n1.2\n1.15\n1.1\n1.05\n1\n0.95\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n\u03b2in\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n0.22\n\nFig. 14.

Results are shown for MD (circles) and MI (squares)\ninteractions, and for stiff (solid lines) and soft (dashed lines) iso-EoS's.\n\nThe ratio between the asymmetry of IMF's and residues can be estimated on\nthe basis of simple energy balance considerations. In fact, isospin migration\nis due to the fact that the neck region has lower density with respect to the\nresidues and the symmetry energy is decreasing with density. Starting from a\nresidue of mass Ares and a neck of mass AIM F of different density but uniform\nasymmetry \u03b2, we assume that the mass A participating in the isospin exchange\nis approximately equal to the mass of the neck, while it is small relative to the\nmass of the residue. This will lead to the asymmetry (\u03b2 + \u2206\u03b2) of the neck, and\nto a total asymmetry \u03b2res = [\u03b2(Ares \u2212 A) + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2)A]/Ares = \u03b2 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2A/Ares\nof the residue, with \u2206\u03b2 to be determined by minimization of the symmetry\nenergy. The corresponding variation of the symmetry energy is equal (apart\nfrom a constant) to:\n\u2206Esym = Ares Esym (\u03c1R )(\u03b2 \u2212 \u2206\u03b2A/Ares )2 + AEsym (\u03c1I )(\u03b2 + \u2206\u03b2)2 , (11)\nwhere \u03c1R and \u03c1I are the densities of the residue and neck regions, respectively.\nThe minimum of the variation of \u2206Esym yields\n\u03b2IM F\nEsym (\u03c1R )\nEsym (\u03c1R ) \u2212 Esym (\u03c1I )\n=\n=1+\n\u03b2res\nEsym (\u03c1I )\nEsym (\u03c1I )\n\n(12)\n\nFrom this simple argument the ratio between the IMF and residue asymmetries\nshould depend only on symmetry energy properties and, in particular, on the\ndifference of the symmetry energy between the residue and the neck regions,\nas appropriate for isospin migration. It should also be larger than one, more\n28\n\n\f1.8\n\n1.6\n\n\u03b2IMF/\u03b2gas\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n\u03b2in\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n0.22\n\nFig. 15. Ratio of asymmetries of IMF to gas for symmetric Sn + Sn reactions as\na function of the initial isospin asymmetry. Semiperipheral events (b = 6f m) at\n50AM eV beam energy. Signatures are as in Fig. 12\n\nso for the asy-stiff than for the asy-soft EoS.\nIt is seen indeed in Fig.12, that this ratio of IMF over residues asymmetry is\nnicely dependent on the iso-EoS only and not on the initial asymmetry. This\nis a clear feature of the dominant isospin migration mechanism which depends\nonly on the density gradients. The ratio is also mostly larger than unity. In\nboth cases, MI and MD interactions, the asy-stiff EoS is more effective in the nenrichment of the dilute region where the IMF's are produced. Moreover, since\nfor the asy-stiff EoS, the derivative of the symmetry energy with respect to the\ndensity is constant, isospin migration effects should be essentially the same in\nMI and MD interactions, as roughly confirmed by Fig.12. On the other hand,\nisospin effects appear quite reduced for the asy-soft EoS, especially for the\nMD interaction for the reasons already mentioned (reduced slope and larger\nneutron emission for the asy-soft EoS for the more compact configurations\nof the MD dynamics). These behaviours leads to a rather large sensitivity to\nthe iso-EOS for the more realistic MD interactions. We note that the iso-EoS\neffect amounts to more than 30%. Since we expect the secondary evaporation\nto affect in a similar way the asymmetry of IMF's and residues, we suggest\nthis observable as very sensitive probe to the isovector part of the EoS.\nA similar investigation can be performed with the ratio of the asymmetries of\nthe IMF to those of the gas. The corresponding results are shown in Fig.15. The\nmechanism of the gas emission is not simply related to the isospin migration\nand now the ratios are seen to be more dependent of the initial asymmetry.\nThe decreasing trend seen from 112 Sn to 124 Sn collisions is a consequence of\nthe larger asymmetry of the gas for the more isospin asymmetric systems (see\nFig. 5). Impressive is the large value of this ratio for the 112 Sn collisions and\n29\n\n\fMD interaction and asy-stiff EoS, which nicely confirms the interpretation\nof a larger proton enrichment and thus smaller asymmetry of the gas phase.\nAlso for this observable a larger sensitivity to the iso-EoS is observed in the\nMD case. This reflects the large difference in the predicted IMF asymmetry\nbetween the two iso-EoS's, as discussed above.\n\n5.4 Double Ratios\nIn order to further reduce the secondary decay effects it has recently been\nproposed to look at double ratios of isospin-dependent quantities, n-rich vs.\nn-poor systems, e.g. in central collisions for the asymmetries of nucleon [19]\nor IMF [20] emissions. From Figs.14/15 this double ratio should always be\naround unity for \u03b2IM F /\u03b2Res , not much depending on the initial asymmetry,\nwhile it appears of interest for the quantity \u03b2IM F /\u03b2gas. From the same class\nof semiperipheral events we can extract Tab.III for the Double Ratios:\n\u03b2IM F /\u03b2gas(124 Sn +124 Sn)\n\u03b2IM F /\u03b2gas(112 Sn +112 Sn)\nWe note the almost 20% Iso-EoS dependence for the more realistic MD interactions.\nTab.

We have focused on semi-peripheral dissipative collisions\nto study both isospin equilibration between the residues and fragmentation\nof the neck between the residues, i.e. to study the isovector part of the EoS\nfor densities below saturation density. The purpose of this investigation has\nbeen to analyze in detail the mechanisms of isospin dynamics and to identify observables, which are sensitive to the still controversial iso-EoS. We have\nemployed two typically different iso-EoS's (asy-soft and asy-stiff), where one\nexpects to see characteristic signatures since the value and the density-slope of\n30\n\n\fthe symmetry energy determine the effects of isospin migration (due to density\ndifferences) and isospin diffusion (due to isospin concentration differences).\nWe have clearly shown that the isospin transport is also dependent on the overall reaction dynamics, mostly ruled by the isoscalar properties of the effective\ninteractions. Thus, it is important to select observables able to disentangle\nbetween isoscalar and isovector contributions.\nIn this respect we have thoroughly analyzed the effects of the well established\n(isoscalar) momentum dependence of the mean field on isospin transport phenomena. The momentum dependence of the effective forces can affect the\nrelationship between isospin transport observables and the symmetry energy\nsince the reaction dynamics is modified. In particular, the interaction times\nare shorter and the composite nuclear systems break starting from more compact configurations. It is then difficult to distinguish effects of the iso-EoS and\nof the momentum-dependence in the usual analysis as a function of centrality.\nFor binary dissipative reactions we therefore suggest a study of the imbalance\nratios as a function of the relative energy loss, which is in turn well correlated\nto the interaction time. We thus obtain rather well defined universal curves,\nincluding results from different MD interactions at different beam energies,\nwhich present, however, a clear dependence on the iso-EoS of the order of\n20%. This kind of analysis should be useful and illuminating in the comparison with experimental data, as well as in testing the predictions of different\ntheoretical models. In fact, it allows to disentangle isospin effects from other\nmodel ingredients that may influence the degree of dissipation reached in the\nsystem.\nFor ternary events, where an Intermediate Mass Fragment (IMF) is formed in\nthe mid-rapidity region (neck fragmentation), the IMF neutron enrichment is\nvery sensitive to the iso-EoS. We have isolated the isospin migration as the\ndominant mechanism in this process in collisions of the symmetric systems\n(124 Sn+124 Sn vs. 112 Sn+112 Sn). The iso-EoS dependence is clearly emerging,\nbeing stronger for an asy-stiff choice with a larger slope of the symmetry\nenergy. We have also found that the effect is larger for the more realistic MD\ndynamics, due to different density regions which are probed.\nAll the properties of the reaction products, i.e. residues, gas and IMF's, are\nevaluated at the freeze-out time and thus they can be modified by the sequential decay of the excited products. We therefore propose the investigation of\n\"relative\" isospin contents, i.e. of ratios of the asymmetry \u03b2 = (N \u2212 Z)/A\nof the various products, which are expected to be less affected by secondary\nemissions. A very promising quantity seems to be the ratio \u03b2IM F /\u03b2Res at midcentrality, which directly measures the isospin migration. In fact, it is found\nto be very sensitive to the iso-EoS, up to above the 30% level for the more\n31\n\n\frealistic MD interactions.\nIn conclusion, we suggest new isospin sensitive observables to study in dissipative HIC at Fermi energies in order to further constrain value and slope of\nthe symmetry term at subsaturation densities.\nIt should also be noticed that the ratios considered here (Imbalance Ratios,\n\u03b2IM F /\u03b2Res ) do not depend, at a first level approximation, on the initial asymmetry of the systems considered, but only on the properties (value and slope)\nof the symmetry energy. Hence valuable information on these properties can\nalready be obtained with the available neutron-rich beams. However, the use\nof radioactive beams in this intermediate energy range would be certainly important in order to extend the systematics of results and to better constrain\nthe symmetry energy behaviour.\nAcknowledgments\nWe warmly thank M.B.Tsang for fruitful discussions.
