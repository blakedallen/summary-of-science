Entanglement can exhibit\nthe nature of a nonlocal correlation between quantum\nsystems that have no classical interpretation. However,\nreal quantum systems will unavoidably be influenced by\nsurrounding environments. The interaction between the\nenvironment and quantum systems of interest can lead to\ndecoherence. Certain kind of the decoherence is the collective dephasing, which occurs in the physical systems\nsuch as trapped ions, quantum dots, or atoms inside a\ncavity. Collective dephasing allows the existence of the\nso-called decoherence-free subspace [2].\nRecently, the Werner or Werner-like states [3, 4, 5, 6]\nhas intrigued many interests for the applications in quantum information processes. Lee and Kim have discussed\nthe entanglement teleportation via the Werner states\n[7]. Hiroshima and Ishizaka have studied the entanglement of the so-called Werner derivative, which is the\nstate transformed by nonlocal unitary-local or nonlocaloperations from a Werner state [8]. Miranowicz has examined the Bell violation and entanglement of Werner\nstates of two qubits in independent decay channels [9].\nThe experimental preparation and characterization of the\nWerner states have also been reported. An experiment\nfor preparing the Werner state via spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been put forward [10]. Altepeter\net al. have experimentally produced the Werner state\nand applied it in the ancilla-assisted process tomography\n[11]. Barbieri et al. have presented a novel technique\nfor generating and characterizing two-photon polarization Werner states [12], which is based on the peculiar\nspatial characteristics of a high brilliance source of entangled pairs.\nThe disentanglement of entangled states of qubits is a\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Stephenli74@yahoo.com.cn\n\nvery important issue for quantum information processes,\nsuch as the solid state quantum computation. Yu and\nEberly have found that the time for decay of the qubit\nentanglement can be significantly shorter than the time\nfor local dephasing of the individual qubits [13, 14]. In\nthis paper, we investigate the entanglement and Bell violation of the standard Werner state or Werner-like states\nin the presence of collective dephasing. The entanglement quantified by the concurrence and Bell violation of\nthe collective dephasing Werner-like state are analyzed.\nWe find that the standard Werner state and certain kinds\nof Werner-like states are robust against the collective dephasing, and some kinds of Werner-like states are fragile\nand become completely disentangled in a finite-time. The\nthreshold time for the complete disappearance of the entanglement of the fragile Werner-like states is obtained.\nWe also provide an explicit example to clarify how the\npure maximally entangled states of two qubits can become separable in the finite time due to the joint action\nof collective dephasing and the external driving fields.\nMeanwhile, there have been several proposals for controlling the entanglement of the qubits in the presence\nof dephasing or dissipation, such as quantum errorcorrecting approach [15, 16, 17], quantum error-avoiding\napproach [18, 19], and loop control strategies [20] etc.\nHere, we present a possible way to preserve the entanglement of two qubits initially in the fragile entangled\nstate under the collective dephasing environment. It is\nshown that the external local driving field with an appropriate finite action time can effectively transform the\nfragile entangled state into a robust entangled state.\nThe standard two-qubit Werner state is defined by [3]\n\u03c1W = r|\u03a8\u2212 ih\u03a8\u2212 | +\n\n1\u2212r\nI \u2297 I,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r \u2208 [0, 1], and |\u03a8\u2212 i is the singlet state of two\nqubits. I is the identity operator of a single qubit. Recently, definition (1) is generalized to include the follow-\n\n\f2\ning states of two qubits [4, 5, 6]\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1W = r|M ihM | +\n\n1\u2212r\nI \u2297 I,\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |M i are any two-qubit maximally entangled states.\nBoth the Werner state (1) and the Werner-like state (2)\nare very important in quantum information. The Werner\nstate (1) is highly symmetric and SU (2)\u2297SU (2) invariant\n[3, 21].\nThe collective dephasing can be described by the master equation [19]\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n\u03b3\n= (2J\u02c6z \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z \u2212 J\u02c6z2 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z2 ),\n\u2202t\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the dephasing rate. J\u02c6z are the collective spin\noperator defined by\nJ\u02c6z =\n\n2\nX\n\n\u03c3\u0302z(i) /2,\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302z for each qubit is defined by \u03c3\u0302z = |1ih1| \u2212 |0ih0|.\nFirstly, it is obvious that the standard Werner state (1) is\ncompletely decoupled from the collective dephasing. So\nin the presence of collective dephasing, the state (1) belongs to the decoherence-free subspace, and it maintain\nits entanglement invariant. Then, we want to know how\nthe collective dephasing affects the Werner-like states defined by Eq.(2). For simplicity, we only consider three\nstates defined by Eq.(2) in which the maximally entangled states are the Bell triglet states. If two qubits are\ninitially in the Werner-like state\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1W = r|\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ | +\n\n1\u2212r\nI \u2297 I,\n4\n\n(5)\n\u221a\n\nwhere |\u03a8+ i is one of the Bell states |\u03a8+ i = 22 (|10i +\n|01i), the collective dephasing does not change the form\nof r|\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ | + 1\u2212r\n4 I \u2297 I. So both the standard Werner\nstate and the Werner-like state r|\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ | + 1\u2212r\n4 I \u2297 I\nbelong to the decoherence-free subspace of the collective\ndephasing. They are robust states against the collective\ndephasing. Are all of the Werner-like states robust states\nagainst the collective dephasing? The answer is no. Now\nwe consider another Werner-like state\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03c1\u00b1\nW = r|\u03a6 ih\u03a6 | +\n\n1\u2212r\nI \u2297 I,\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\u221a\n\nwhere |\u03a6\u00b1 i is the Bell states |\u03a6\u00b1 i = 22 (|11i \u00b1 |00i). It\nis assumed that the initial state of master equation (3)\nis \u03c1\u00b1\nW . Then its time evolution density matrix can be\nexpressed as\n\u22122\u03b3t \u00b1\n\u03c1\u00b1\n|\u03a6 ih\u03a6\u00b1 | +\nW (t) = re\n\nC = max{\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 , 0},\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the \u03bbi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are the square roots of the\neigenvalues in decreasing order of magnitude of the \"spinflipped\" density matrix operator R = \u03c1s (\u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 y )\u03c1\u2217s (\u03c3 y \u2297\n\u03c3 y ), where the asterisk indicates complex conjugation.\nThe concurrence related to the density matrix \u03c1\u00b1\nW (t) can\nbe written as\nC(t) = max(0,\n\nr\u22121\n+ re\u22122\u03b3t ).\n2\n\n(9)\n\nFrom Eq.(9), we can know that, different from the standard Werner state described by Eq.(1) and r|\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ | +\n1\u2212r\n1\u2212r\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n4 I \u2297 I, the Werner-like state r|\u03a6 ih\u03a6 | + 4 I \u2297 I\nrapidly loses its entanglement in the presence of collective dephasing. The threshold time tc beyond which the\nentanglement of two qubits completely disappears can be\nobtained as\ntc = \u2212\n\n1\u2212r\n1\nln[\n].\n2\u03b3\n2r\n\n(10)\n\nBeing similar to the results in Ref.[23], the Werner-like\nstate described by Eq.(5) is completely disentangled in a\nfinite time due to the collective dephasing if the initial\nparameter r 6= 1. It is also interesting to investigate how\nthe collective dephasing affects the mixedness defined by\nM = 43 (1 \u2212 Tr\u03c12 ). The mixedness of the time evolution\ndensity matrix (6) can be calculated as\nM (t) = 1 \u2212\n\nr2\n2r2 \u22124\u03b3t\n\u2212\ne\n.\n3\n3\n\n(11)\n\nWhen \u03b3t \u2192 \u221e, the final mixedness of the state in Eq.(6)\n2\nequals to 1 \u2212 r3 . It is shown that the state r|\u03a6\u00b1 ih\u03a6\u00b1 | +\n1\u2212r\n4 I \u2297 I loses its purity in the collective dephasing. The\nlarger the parameter r, the smaller the final mixedness.\nIn the following, we attempt to discuss how the collective dephasing affects the Bell violation of the Wernerlike states. Bell violation is not an entanglement measure. Those states violating the Bell inequality must be\nnonseparable. However, certain kinds of entangled states\nmay not violate the Bell inequality. The most commonly\ndiscussed Bell inequality is the CHSH inequality [24, 25].\nThe CHSH operator reads\nB\u0302 = ~a * ~\u03c3 \u2297 (~b + b~\u2032 ) * ~\u03c3 + a~\u2032 * ~\u03c3 \u2297 (~b \u2212 b~\u2032 ) * ~\u03c3 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere ~a, a~\u2032 , ~b, b~\u2032 are unit vectors.

The concurrence varies from C = 0 for an unentangled state to C = 1\nfor a maximally entangled state. For two qubits, in the\n\"Standard\" eigenbasis: |1i \u2261 |11i, |2i \u2261 |10i, |3i \u2261 |01i,\n|4i \u2261 |00i, the concurrence may be calculated explicitly\nfrom the following:\n\n(7)\n\n|hB\u0302i| \u2264 2.\n\n(13)\n\n\f3\n4.0\n\nThe maximal amount of Bell violation of a state \u03c1 is given\nby [26]\nq\n(14)\nB = 2 \u03bb + \u03bb\u0303,\nwhere \u03bb and \u03bb\u0303 are two largest eigenvalues of T\u03c1\u2020 T\u03c1 .\nThe matrix T\u03c1 is determined completely by the correlation functions being a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix whose elements are\n(T\u03c1 )nm = Tr(\u03c1\u03c3n \u2297 \u03c3m ). Here, \u03c31 \u2261 \u03c3x , \u03c32 \u2261 \u03c3y , and\n\u03c33 \u2261 \u03c3z denote the usual Pauli matrices. We call the\nquantity B the maximal violation measure, which indicates the Bell violation\n\u221a when B > 2 and the maximal\nviolation when B = 2 2. For the density matrix \u03c1\u00b1\nW (t)\nin Eq.(6), \u03bb + \u03bb\u0303 can be written as follows\n\u03bb + \u03bb\u0303 = r2 (1 + e\u22124\u03b3t ).\n\n(15)\n\nThe threshold time tbc beyond which the collective dephasing Werner-like state does not violate the Bell-CHSH\ninequality can be given by\ntbc = \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 r2\n1\nln( 2 ).\n4\u03b3\nr\n\n3.6\n3.2\n2.8\n2.4\n\n\u03b3tc\n\n2.0\n1.6\n\nC\n1.2\n0.8\n\nB\n0.4\n0.0\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nr\n\nFIG. 1: The threshold time \u03b3tc and \u03b3tbc of the concurrence\nand the maximal Bell violation respectively, are plotted as\nthe function of the parameter r for the collective dephasing\nWerner-like states in Eq.(7). (Solid line) \u03b3tc in Eq.(10); (Dash\nline) \u03b3tbc in Eq.(16). It is shown that both \u03b3tc and \u03b3tbc increase\nwith r.\n\n(16)\n\nEqs.(14-15) show that, if r 6= 1, i.e. the initial state is\nnot a maximally entangled state, the dephasing Wernerlike state in Eq.(7) rapidly loses its nonlocality in a finite\ntime. The smaller the initial entanglement, the more\nrapidly the nonlocality completely disappears. In Fig.1,\nthe threshold time tc and tbc concerning the complete disentanglement and the disappearance of nonlocality of the\nstate (7) respectively, have been plotted as the function\nof the parameter r. It implies that both the entanglement and nonlocality are completely destroyed in a finite\ntime if the initial state is not pure. While the collective\ndephasing can not completely destroy nonlocality and\nentanglement of the pure Bell states |\u03a6\u00b1 i in the finite\ntime. According to two threshold times, we can classify\nthe Werner-like state (6) by making use of the parameter r or the initial mixedness. If r = 0, the state (6)\nreduces to the maximally mixed state. In the range of\n0 < r \u2264 31 , the states in Eq.(6) are separable. In the\n\u221a\nrange of 13 < r \u2264 22 , they are entangled but not non\u221a\nlocal. In the range of 22 < r < 1, they are inseparable\nand nonlocal, and both their nonlocality and entanglement can be completely destroyed by the collective dephasing. Recently, Yu and Eberly have shown a novel\nphenomenon that, under the influence of pure vacuum\nnoise two entangled qubits become completely disentangled in a finite-time [23]. In a specific\u221aexample they have\nfound the time to be given by ln(1 + 22 ) times the usual\nspontaneous lifetime. Here, we have obtained a similar\nresult that in the presence of collective dephasing, two\ninitial mixed entangled qubits become completely disentangled in a finite-time. It is conjectured that, in this\ncase, the initial mixedness is an essential fact whether\ntwo entangled qubits become completely disentangled in\na finite-time or not. In fact, previous work concerning the\n\ninteraction between a initial mixed qubit and the thermal\nfield in the presence of phase decoherence have revealed\nsome analogical results [27].\nIt is also very interesting to investigate how an external\ndriving field affects the complete disentanglement time in\nthis situation. If the external driving fields are taken into\naccount, the master equation (3) should be replaced by\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\ni\n\u03b3\n= \u2212 [\u03a91 \u03c3\u0302x(1) + \u03a92 \u03c3\u0302x(2) , \u03c1\u0302] + (2J\u02c6z \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z \u2212 J\u02c6z2 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z2 ),\n\u2202t\n2\n2\n(17)\nwhere \u03a9i (i = 1, 2) are the intensity of the external\ndriving field acted on the ith qubit. \u03c3\u0302x for each qubit\nare defined by \u03c3\u0302x = |1ih0| + |0ih1|. In the case with\n\u03a91 = \u03a92 = \u03a9, the standard Werner state is still decoupled from the above master equation, while other Wernerlike states lose their entanglement. In order to know\n1\u2212r\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nwhether r|\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ | + 1\u2212r\n4 I \u2297 I and r|\u03a6 ih\u03a6 | + 4 I \u2297 I\ncan be completely disentangled in a finite time or not,\nit is sufficient to verify Bell states |\u03a8+ i and |\u03a6\u00b1 i are\ncompletely disentangled in their evolutions governed by\nEq.(17). In Fig.2, the dynamical behaviors of concurrence of two qubits initially in Bell triplet states governed by Eq.(17) are displayed. It is shown that all of\nBell triplet states are completely disentangled in a finite\ntime, which imply all of the Werner-like states defined\nby Eq.(5) and Eq.(7) are finite-time disentangled in the\njoint action of the collective dephasing and external driving fields. From Fig.2, it can be observed that |\u03a6\u2212 i most\nrapidly loses its entanglement among all of Bell triplet\nstates. In the case with \u03a91 6= \u03a92 , the Bell singlet state\nis no longer decoupled from the Eq.(17). In Fig.3, we\nshow that four Bell states become complete disentanglement in the finite time in the situation with \u03a91 = \u03b3 and\n\u03a92 = 0.

It is shown that all of Bell triplet states\nbecome separable in different finite times in the joint action\nof collective dephasing and driving fields. In the case without\nthe driving fields, Bell triplet states can not become separable\nin finite time.\n\nand forces the Bell singlet state out of the decoherencefree subspace. Nevertheless, |\u03a8\u00b1 i are more robust than\n|\u03a6\u00b1 i in this case, and the threshold time corresponding\nto the complete disentanglement of two qubits initially\nin |\u03a8\u00b1 i is about twice as large as the one corresponding\nto the complete disentanglement of two qubits initially\nin |\u03a6\u00b1 i.\nIn what follows, we briefly discuss a possible scheme to\nprevent the fragile entangled states from complete disentanglement under the action of collective dephasing. We\nassume that only one of two qubits is driven by a timedependent external field. For simplicity, the time dependence of the external driving field is suggested to be the\nform of the unit step function. The dynamics of two\nqubits can be described by the following master equation\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\ni\n\u03b3\n= \u2212 [\u03b61 (t)\u03c3\u0302x(1) , \u03c1\u0302] + (2J\u02c6z \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z \u2212 J\u02c6z2 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302J\u02c6z2 ), (18)\n\u2202t\n2\n2\nwhere \u03b61 (t) = \u03b61 \u0398(T \u2212 t) is the intensity of the timedependent external driving field acted on the qubit 1,\nand \u0398(x) is the unit step function and equals one for\nx \u2265 0 and equals zero for x < 0. In previous experimental verification of the decoherence-free subspace [28], the\nexternal driving field and the collective dephasing are not\nsimultaneously acted on the qubits. It is obvious that the\n(1)\nlocal external driving field \u03b61 (t)\u03c3\u0302x can interconvert the\nBell states without the simultaneous presence of collective dephasing. Nevertheless, it is desirable to determine\nthe influence of the variation of T on the eventual stationary state entanglement when the driving field and the collective dephasing are simultaneously acted on the qubits\nin some realistic situations. Our numerical calculations\nshow that the external field with an appropriate value of\n\n\f5\n1.0\n\ntal results. In ref.[28], Kwiat et al. have presented the\nexperimental verification of decoherence-free subspace in\nthe system of polarized photons. For investigating the influence of collective dephasing on the initial state, one can\n\u221a\n\u221a\nadopt the general fidelity F (\u03c1i , \u03c1f ) \u2261 [Tr( \u03c1i \u03c1f \u03c1i )1/2 ]2\n[29], where \u03c1i is the initial state and \u03c1f the final state.\nThe fidelity between the initial Werner-like state \u03c1\u00b1\nW in\nEq.(6) and the corresponding dephasing state \u03c1\u00b1\n(t)\nin\nW\nEq.(7) can be calculated as\n\n(a)\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nCs\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nFW =\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\nwhich decreases with r and t.

In this case, when \u03b3T > 2, there is\nnot any stationary state entanglement between two qubits.\n\nT can transform the initial fragile entangled state |\u03a6+ i\ninto a stationary entangled state even if the collective\ndephasing is always presence. In Fig.4, the stationary\nstate concurrence Cs and the stationary state Bell violation |B (s) |max of two qubits are plotted as the function\nof the parameter \u03b3T . It is shown that, if only the value\nof \u03b61 /\u03b3 is large enough, one can maintain the entanglement and Bell violation of two qubits initially in a very\nfragile entangled state by making use of the local driving\nfield with an appropriate action time T . We can see that\nthe stationary state entanglement firstly increases with\n\u03b3T , and achieves a local maximal value, then decreases\nwith \u03b3T . Similar behaviors are repeated again when the\nscaled action time \u03b3T is further enlarged. The stationary state Bell violation also oscillates with \u03b3T . The above\ncalculations show one can effectively transform the fragile entangled state into a robust entangled state. This is\nmeaningful and very important in many areas of quantum information processes.\nFinally, we attempt to discuss the theoretical results\nabout the fragile and robust Werner state in collective\ndephasing by comparing them with previous experimen-\n\nJ\u02c6\u03b8 =\n\n2\nX\n\n(i)\n\n\u03c3\u0302\u03b8 /2,\n\n(21)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302\u03b8 for each qubit is defined by \u03c3\u0302\u03b8 = cos 2\u03b8\u03c3\u0302z +\nsin 2\u03b8\u03c3\u0302x . Throughout the following calculations, we\nchoose \u03b8 = 17\u25e6 for representing the realistic situation\nin Ref.[28]. The fidelity between the initial Werner-like\nstates and corresponding stationary state of Eq.(20) for\nthree different initial states has been calculated and the\nresults are depicted in Fig.5. It was found that the fidelities decrease with r and the theoretical results excellently agree with the experimental data in Ref.[28]. By\ncomparing two table.1 in present paper and in Ref.[28],\nit may be interesting that the initial states in [28] look\nlike the Werner or Werner-like states with very high purity. In Fig.6, the evolution of fidelities are investigated\nfor three different initial states. It is shown that the fidelity decreases with dephasing time and eventually stays\nat a fixed value, which implies that these chosen initial states are out of the decoherence-free subspace of\nEq.(20). It is shown that evolving fidelity of the initial\n1\nstate 0.99|\u03a6\u2212 ih\u03a6\u2212 | + 400\nI \u2297 I is larger than the one of\n1\n+\n+\n0.99|\u03a6 ih\u03a6 | + 400 I \u2297 I in short time.\nIn summary, we investigate the concurrence and Bell\nviolation of the standard Werner state or Werner-like\nstates in the presence of collective dephasing. By making use of the analytical expressions of the concurrence\nand Bell violation obtained in the present paper, we\nfind that the standard Werner state and certain kinds\nof Werner-like states are robust against the collective dephasing, and some kinds of Werner-like states is fragile and becomes completely disentangled in a finite-time.\nThe threshold time of complete disentanglement of the\n\n\f6\n1.00\n\ntion [30, 31] or other remote quantum information processes.\nWe also discuss the possible way to transform the frag-\n\n0.75\n\n1.0\n\n+\n\n\u03c1\n\nW\n\n-\n\n\u03c1W\n\n0.9\n\n'\n\n\u03c1W\n\n+\n\nF\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.50\n\n'\n\n\u03c1W\n\n0.7\n\n0.25\n\nF\n0.00\n0.0\n\nW\n\n-\n\n\u03c1W\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nr\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nFIG. 5: The fidelity F \u2261 [Tr( \u03c1i \u03c1f \u03c1i )1/2 ]2 for three kinds\nof initial states and their corresponding complete dephasing\nstates are plotted as the function of the parameter r.

We can see that present theoretical calculations based on the Eq.(20) and the initial Wernerlike state assumption well agree with the experimental data\nin table.1 of Ref.[28].\n\nfragile Werner-like states is analyzed. We conjecture\nthat the initial mixedness is an important fact to determine whether two entangled qubits become completely\ndisentangled in a finite-time or not in the pure collective dephasing. Moreover, the threshold time concerning\nthe complete disappearance of the Bell violation of some\nkinds of fragile Werner-like states is also obtained. Furthermore, we investigate how an external driving field\naffects the completely disentanglement time and clarify\nthat the pure maximally entangled states of two qubits\ncan become separable in the finite time in this situation. Since the standard Werner state or Werner-like\nstates play a special role in some quantum information\nprocesses, such as quantum teleportation, our results\nmay have potential applications in quantum teleporta-\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n\u03b3t\n\nFIG. 6: The fidelities for three kinds of initial states and\ntheir corresponding evolving states governed by Eq.(20) are\nplotted as the function of \u03b3t.

It is shown that a local external driving field with an appropriate finite action\ntime can effectively maintain both the entanglement and\nBell violation of two qubits even if the collective dephasing is presence from beginning to end.\nRecently, the quantum information processes in the\npresence of the collective dephasing have intrigued much\nattention [13, 14, 32, 33, 34]. Khodjasteh and Lidar have\ninvestigated the universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of spontaneous emission and collective dephasing [32]. Hill and Goan have studied the\neffect of dephasing on proposed quantum gates for the\nsolid-state Kane quantum computing architecture [33].\nIn the future work, it may be very interesting to apply\nthe present results to discuss the influence of collective\ndephasing on gate fidelity of remote quantum computation.\nFinally, we also compare the theoretical results about\nthe fidelity of the initial Werner-like state in the presence\nof collective dephasing with recent experimental data of\nKwiat et al [28]. It is shown that they are consistent with\neach other.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis project was supported by the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (Project NO. 10174066).\n\n\f7\n\n[1] M. A.
