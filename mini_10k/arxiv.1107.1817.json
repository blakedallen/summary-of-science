General Relativity successfully describes classical\ngravitational fields; yet, it is not a completely satisfactory\ntheory, since it is unable to deal with certain issues, with\ndark energy, dark matter, and the nature of the singularity inside a black hole, for instance [1].\nBy the Correspondence Principle, a quantum theory\nof gravity should reproduce General Relativity in the\nsame way that Quantum Electrodynamics reproduces\nMaxwell's equations. It is believed that such a theory\nwill play an important role at Planck's scale and in a\ngrand unification scheme, given the extraordinary advance achieved by unifying three of the four fundamental\nforces.\nAn early attempt to quantize gravity is the pathintegral method applied to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density. In this approach, only in specific configurations is it possible to make statements about features of the system; thus, in the case of a black hole the\nentropy is found to be proportional to its event-horizon\narea, which can be measured by a procedure avoiding\nspace-time singularities [2]. The interaction between particles inside and outside the event horizon will cause the\nevaporation of the black hole; this phenomenon, known\nas Hawking's radiation [3], has motivated recent experimental investigations [4]. Whether such an interaction\noffers a microscopic explanation for the black-hole entropy is the subject of debate that has fueled intense\nresearch.\nThe hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity is\nconstrained, hence very difficult to deal with. Dirac developed a method to quantize such systems, which gave\nrise to a family of theories known as canonical quantum\ngravity [5, 6]. Among them, Regge calculus [7, 8] and\nLoop Quantum Gravity [9, 10] stand out, an alternative\napproach being addressed by String Theory.\n\n\u2217\n\nsc.ulhoa@gmail.com\n\nEvery attempt to construct a quantum theory of gravity has to face its non-renormalizable feature [11] and\ndeal with the problem of time [12]. Dirac's quantization method applied to teleparallel gravity could provide\nan interesting approach to that goal, since the energy\nconstraint of its Hamiltonian formulation has shown excellent results when applied to different systems over the\nyears [13, 14].\nLoop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is the most prominent\ntheory of quantum gravity. It tries to quantize gravity in\na nonpertubative way, independently of the chosen spatial background metric [9, 15, 16]. The concept of spin\nfoams being essential, the volume and area operators give\nrise to \"grains of space-time\". Loop Quantum Cosmology stems from LQG; here, however, serious conceptual\nproblems have to be addressed, such as the interpretation\nof the wave function of the Universe and the avoidance\nof the Big Bang singularity [17, 18].\nIn grativation, the definition of the energy-momentum\nvector is very controversial. Most attempts lead to\ncoordinate-dependent expressions or limited ones such\nas the ADM energy, valid only on the asymptotic spacetime [19]. In the context of teleparallel gravity, by contrast, a well defined vector arises naturally from the field\nequations [13]. This immediately suggests that secondquantization methods be applied to the gravitational\nenergy-momentum tensor in a linearized approximation,\nan approach adopted in this paper. The gravitationalfield properties are then analogous to those of the electromagnetic field. In particular, the gravitational energymomentum tensor being quadratic in the tetrad field,\nannihilation and creation operators are easily identified.\nThis approach contrasts with attempts to quantize matter fields in a semi-classical approach rooted in Einstein's\nequations and does not depend on Dirac's algorithm to\nidentify quantum features of the gravitational field.\nIn the following, the greek letters \u03bc, \u03bd, ... represent\nspace-time indices, while the latin letters a, b, ..., denote\nSO(3,1) indices. In both cases, the indices run from 0 to\n3. Time and space indices are indicated according to the\nconvention \u03bc = 0, i, a = (0), (i). The determinant of the\ntetrad field is denoted e = det(ea \u03bc ), and units are such\n\n\f2\nwhere Ta\u03bc is the energy-momentum tensor of matter\nfields. Explicit calculation shows that Eq. (8) is equivalent to Einstein's equations.\nThe field equations can be rewritten in the form\n\nthat G = c = h = 1.\nII.\n\nTELEPARALLEL GRAVITY\n\nThis section presents a brief review of teleparallel gravity. In this theory the tetrad field, not the metric tensor,\nis the dynamical field variable. The tetrad field is related\nto the metric tensor by the expressions\ng \u03bc\u03bd = ea\u03bc ea \u03bd ;\n\u03b7 ab = ea\u03bc eb \u03bc .\n\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd = \u0393\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd + K\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 0 \u0393\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd are the Christoffel symbols, and K\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd ,\nwhich is given by\nK\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd =\n\n1\n(T\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd + T\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc + T\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd ),\n2\n\n(3)\n\nis the contortion tensor defined in terms of the torsion\ntensor constructed from the Cartan connection. Thus\nthe torsion tensor is T\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd = ea\u03bc T a \u03bb\u03bd with\nT a \u03bb\u03bd = \u2202\u03bb ea \u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd ea \u03bb .\n\n(4)\n\nThe curvature tensor obtained from \u0393\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd is identically\nzero. Equation (2) thus leads to\n1\n1\neR(e) \u2261 \u2212e( T abc Tabc + T abc Tbac \u2212 T a Ta ) + 2\u2202\u03bc (eT \u03bc ).\n4\n2\n(5)\nWe then drop the divergence on the right-hand side to\ndefine the teleparallel Lagrangian density\n1\n1\nL(ea\u03bc ) = \u2212\u03ba e ( T abc Tabc + T abc Tbac \u2212 T a Ta ) \u2212 LM\n4\n2\n\u2261 \u2212\u03ba e\u03a3abc Tabc \u2212 LM ,\n(6)\nwhere \u03ba = 1/(16\u03c0), LM stands for Lagrangian density of\nmatter fields, and \u03a3abc is given by\n\u03a3\n\nabc\n\n1\ne ea \u03bc (t\u03bb\u03bc + T \u03bb\u03bc ),\n4\u03ba\n\n1\n1\n= (T abc + T bac \u2212 T cab ) + (\u03b7 ac T b \u2212 \u03b7 ab T c ) , (7)\n4\n2\na\n\nwith T a = T b b . It is important to notice that the\nEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density is equivalent to its\nteleparallel version (6). Thus, concerning observational\ndata, both theories share the same results.\nWe then compute the variational derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to ea\u03bc to obtain the following field equations:\n1\n1\neTa\u03bc ,\nea\u03bb eb\u03bc \u2202\u03bd (e\u03a3b\u03bb\u03bd )\u2212e(\u03a3b\u03bd a Tb\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 ea\u03bc Tbcd \u03a3bcd ) =\n4\n4\u03ba\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere t\u03bb\u03bc is defined by the equality\nt\u03bb\u03bc = \u03ba(4\u03a3bc\u03bb Tbc \u03bc \u2212 g \u03bb\u03bc \u03a3bcd Tbcd ).\n\nwhere \u03b7 ab = diag(\u2212 + ++) is the metric tensor of\nMinkowski space-time.\nConsider now a manifold endowed with the Cartan\nconnection [20] \u0393\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd = ea \u03bc \u2202\u03bb ea\u03bd , which can equally well\nbe written in the form\n0\n\n\u2202\u03bd (e\u03a3a\u03bb\u03bd ) =\n\n(10)\n\nSince \u03a3a\u03bb\u03bd is skew-symmetric in the last two indices, it\nfollows that\n\u2202\u03bb \u2202\u03bd (e\u03a3a\u03bb\u03bd ) \u2261 0.\n\n(11)\n\n\u2202\u03bb (eta\u03bb + eT a\u03bb ) = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nWe thus see that\n\nwhich yields the continuity equation\nZ\nI\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\n3\na\n0\u03bc\n0\u03bc\nd x e e \u03bc (t +T ) = \u2212 dSj e ea \u03bc (tj\u03bc + T j\u03bc ) .\ndt V\nS\nAccordingly, t\u03bb\u03bc is interpreted as the energymomentum tensor of the gravitational field [21], and the\ntotal energy-momentum in a three-dimensional volume\nV of space is\nZ\na\nd3 x e ea \u03bc (t0\u03bc + T 0\u03bc ).\n(13)\nP =\nV\n\nThe right-hand side remains invariant under coordinate\ntransformations, transforms like a vector under Lorentz\ntransformations and hence displays the expected features\nof a true energy-momentum vector.\nIII. QUANTIZED ENERGY AND\nRE-QUANTIZATION OF MATTER\n\nWe now turn our attention to a linearized theory of\nteleparallelism. In this approximation the tetrad field\ncan be written in the form\nea \u03bc \u2248 \u03b4\u03bca + \u03c8 a \u03bc ,\n\n(14)\n\nand the metric tensor has a similar expansion:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd .\nAt this point, the energy-momentum of matter fields is\nzero, and the energy-momentum vector P a depends on\nta\u03bc only. Simple algebraic manipulations convert ta\u03bc to\nthe form\n1\n1\nt0a \u2248 \u2212\u03ba \u03b4\u03bca (\u2202 \u03bd \u03c8 c0 \u2212 \u2202 0 \u03c8 c\u03bd )\u2202 \u03bc \u03c8c\u03bd \u2212 \u03ba \u03b4\u03bca \u03b7 0\u03bc \u00d7\n4\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(15)\n\u00d7 (\u2202\u03bd \u03c8 c \u03b3 )(\u2202 \u03b3 \u03c8c \u03bd ) \u2212 (\u2202 \u03bb \u03c8 c \u03bb )(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8c \u03bc ) .\n\n\f3\nConsider now the Fourier expansion of \u03c8a\u03bc in a threedimensional normalized volume,\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010\n\u03c8a\u03bc = \u221a\nAa\u03bc (k, t)e\u0131k*x + A\u2020a\u03bc (k, t)e\u2212\u0131k*x , (16)\n2\u03c9 k\nwhere the time dependence of the coefficients Aa\u03bc (k, t)\nis of the form e\u2212\u0131\u03c9t . For the purposes of second quantization, it is sufficient to consider terms containing\nAa\u03bc (k, t)A\u2020a\u03bc (k, t) and analogous combinations, no generality being lost, since quadratic terms with Aa\u03bc (k, t)\nand A\u2020a\u03bc (k, t) do not contribute to the hamiltonian operator in the context of annihilation and creation operators. Notice, moreover, that the time average of these\nquadratic terms over a period vanishes. Thus, in the\ntransversal gauge k \u03bc \u03c8a\u03bc = 0, where k \u03bc = (\u03c9, k) with\nk \u03bc k\u03bc = 0, the time average of the energy in Eq. (13)\nreads\n\u0011\nX1 \u0010\nP (0) \u2248 \u03ba\n\u03c9 Aa\u03bc (k)A\u2020a\u03bc (k) + A\u2020a\u03bc (k)Aa\u03bc (k) .\n2\nk\n(17)\nThe coefficients in (16) assumed to be operators, the constraint [A\u2020a\u03bc (k), Ab\u03bd (k\u2032 )] = \u03b4kk\u2032 \u03b4ba \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc leads to the hamiltonian operator\nX1 \u0010\n1\u0011\n,\n\u03c9 \u00c2\u2020a\u03bc (k)\u00c2a\u03bc (k) +\n\u0124 \u2248 \u03ba\n4\n2\n\n(18)\n\nk\n\nwhere the \u00c2\u2020a\u03bc (k) are creation and the \u00c2a\u03bc (k) are annihilation operators. A similar analysis starting from\nEq. (13) leads to the following expression for the gravitational momentum in terms of creation and annihilation\noperators:\nX1 \u0010\n1\u0011\nP\u0302 \u2248 \u03ba\n.\n(19)\nk \u00c2\u2020a\u03bc (k)\u00c2a\u03bc (k) +\n4\n2\nk\n\nEquations (18) and (19) are remarkably similar to the\nQED expressions for the electromagnetic energy and momentum, respectively. If a set of orthonormal wave functions obeying \u0124\u03a8 = E\u03a8 is postulated, then the eigenvalue of \u0124 is\nX1\nE\u2248\u03ba\n\u03c9Nk ,\n(20)\n4\nk\n\nwhere Nk is the number of gravitons, and the constant\nsecond term within parentheses on the right-hand side of\nEq. (18) was dropped to avoid a trivial divergence. In\nthis context, the gravitational field can be regarded as a\ncollection of gravitons playing the role of photons in an\nelectromagnetic field.\nIn order to make a prediction, let us consider the spacetime around a black hole, which is described by the line\nelement\nds2 = \u2212(1\u22122M/r)dt2 +(1\u22122M/r)\u22121 dr 2 +r 2 d\u03b82 +r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n(21)\n\nfound in Schwarzschild's solution [22]. Under the weak\nfield condition M/r << 1, Eq. (21) fits our linearized\ntheory.\nFor stationary observers, Eq. (13) is reduced to the\nform\nZ\n1\nE=\nd\u03b8 d\u03c6(eT 1 ),\n8\u03c0 S\nwhere\ns\u0012\n\u0013!\n2M\n1\u2212\n.\neT 1 = 2r sin \u03b8 1 \u2212\nr\nIf we then let S \u2192 \u221e, to cover the whole space-time,\nwe find that the energy of the Schwarzschild space-time\nis E = M , a result that is well known in the context\nof asymptotic expressions such as the ADM energy (see\nfor instance [23]) and holds equally well in the weak-field\napproximation. We can therefore extract the mass of the\nblack hole from Eq. (20), which yields the expression\nM \u2248\u03ba\n\nX1\nk\n\n4\n\n\u03c9Nk .\n\n(22)\n\nThis identification is valid only for inertial frames,\nsince it depends on our derivation of the energymomentum vector from the expansion (14), and the chosen gauge. Notice should be taken that Eq. (22) was\nderived in an empty space-time and relates the number\nof gravitons to the mass of the black hole. That result\ntells us that mass is quantized in a new sense, other than\nthe concept of particle or atom. For this reason, we refer\nto it as a requantization of a black hole.\nSince the mass of the black hole on the left-hand side\nof Eq. (22) is finite, the right-hand side is expected to be\nfinite as well. The sum should therefore be truncated at\nsome point, and the mass of the black hole, given by\nM \u2248 m0 + m1 + . . . + mN\nwhere each m is a quantum of mass dependent on a specific frequency.\nThat the gravitons are bosons is shown by the commutation relations between the annihilation and creation\noperators and by the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian operator. Although the preceding analysis has led to no\nconclusion concerning spin, preliminary studies extending the teleparallel-gravity procedure to the gravitational\nangular momentum suggest that the graviton has spin 2.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe results in this paper can be summarized as follows.\nTeleparallel gravity yields an energy-momentum vector\nthat is independent of coordinate transformations. In a\nlinearized theory, \u03c8a\u03bc can be expanded in a Fourier series,\nand this leads to second-quantized expressions for the\n\n\f4\nenergy and momentum. For inertial frames, the energy of\nSchwarzschild's space-time is given by M , a result that is\nvalid even in the weak-field approximation and identifies\na new form of quantization, which is associated with the\nnumber of gravitons.\nIt should be noticed that the requantization encompasses only the gravitational energy-momentum; no matter fields are involved. The resulting new quantization of\nthe font of gravitation contrasts with what Loop Quantum Gravity asserts with its discrete space-time.\nThe definition of the ADM energy shows that the mass\nof a black hole has to be associated with a particle of integer spin-the graviton. Matter, however, is constituted\n\nof fermions. The resulting apparent contradiction constitutes a serious obstacle obstructing the development of\nquantum theories of gravity.\nThe next challenge, thus, is to develop a general theory for the requantization of mass, one that identifies general creation and annihilation operators. A general equation for quantum gravity in the teleparallel case could be\nanalogous to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation [24\u201326], and\nhence bring to light the quantum nature of matter. The\npursuit of a quantum theory of gravity should not treat\nmatter and space-time on different footings. The inextricable connection between the two entities should emerge\nfrom the (re)quantization of matter itself.\n\n[1] C. Kiefer, Ann. Phys. 15, 129 (2006).\n[2] G. W. Gibbons and S. W.
