Introduction\nThe exclusive production of baryon-antybaryon (BB) pairs in the collision\nof two quasi-real photons can be used to test predictions of QCD. At e+ e\u2212\ncolliders the photons are emitted by the beam electronsa and the BB pairs\nare produced in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 BB.\nThe application of QCD to exclusive photon-photon reactions is based\non the work of Brodsky and Lepage 1 . According to their formalism the process is factorized into a non-perturbative part, which is the hadronic wave\nfunction of the final state, and a perturbative part. Calculations based\non this ansatz 2,3 yields e.g. e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 pp\u0304 cross-sections\nabout one order of magnitude smaller than the existing experimental results 4,5,6,7,8,9 , for pp\u0304 centre-of-mass energies W greater than 2.5 GeV.\nRecent studies 10 have extended the systematic investigation of hard\nexclusive reactions within the quark-diquark model to photon-photon processes 11,12 . In addition, the handbag contribution 13 has been recently proposed to describe the photon-photon annihilation into baryon-antibaryon\npairs at large momentum transfer.\na In\n\nthis paper positrons are also referred to as electrons.\n1\n\n\fOctober 6, 2018\n\n7:26\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nbarillari\n\n2\n\nIn this paper, all the existing measurements of the cross-sections for the\nexclusive e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 BB processes are presented. In particular, results\nfor \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u039b\u039b, and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03a30 \u03a30 final states are reported. These\ncross-section measurements are compared with the analytic calculations\nbased on the three-quark model, on the quark-diquark model, and on the\nhandbag model.\n2. The \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304 cross-section measurements\nThe differential cross-section for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 pp\u0304 is given by\n\nd2 \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 pp\u0304)\nNev (W, | cos \u03b8\u2217 |)\n=\n\u2217 |) \u2206W \u2206| cos \u03b8 \u2217 |\ndW isd|the\ncosnumber\n\u03b8\u2217 |\nLe+ e\u2212 selected\n\u03b5TRIG \u03b5DET\n(W, (W,\n| cos|\u03b8cos\nwhere N\nof events\nin each\n\u03b8\u2217 |) bin, \u03b5TRIG is\nev\nthe trigger efficiency, \u03b5DET is the detection efficiency, Le+ e\u2212 is the measured\nintegrated luminosity, and \u2206W and \u2206| cos \u03b8\u2217 | are the bin widths in W and\nin | cos \u03b8\u2217 |.\n\u221a\nThe total cross-section \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304) for a given value of see is derived\nfrom the differential cross-section d\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 pp\u0304)/dW by using the\nluminosity function dL\u03b3\u03b3 /dW 14 .\nThe resulting differential cross-sections for the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304 in bins\nof W and | cos \u03b8\u2217 | are then summed over | cos \u03b8\u2217 | to obtain the total crosssection as a function of W for | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.6.\nFig. 1a) shows the cross-section \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304) measurements as a function of W for | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.6 obtained by ARGUS 4 , CLEO 5 , VENUS 6 ,\nOPAL 7 , L3 8 , and BELLE 9 . Some predictions based on the quark-diquark\nmodel 10,11 , and the three-quark model 2 are also shown in this figure.\nThere is good agreement between the different experiments results for\nW > 2.3GeV. At W < 2.3 GeV the OPAL 7 measurements agree with\nthe ARGUS 4 results, but both these measurements lie below the results\nobtained by CLEO 5 , VENUS 6 , L3 8 , and BELLE 9 .\nWithin the estimated theoretical uncertainties and for W > 2.2GeV\nthere is a good agreement between the L3 8 and OPAL 7 results and\nthe quark-diquark model predictions 10,11 . The three-quark model is excluded 2 . At low W the BELLE 9 results are above the quark-diquark model\npredictions. This measurement agrees with the quark-diquark model for\n2.5 GeV < W < 3.0 GeV, while at higher W a steeper fall of the BELLE 9\ncross-section is observed.\nAn important consequence of the pure quark hard scattering picture is the power law which follows from the dimensional counting\nrules 15,16 .

The inner error bars are the statistical uncertainties and the outer\nerror bars are the total uncertainties.\n\nthe differential cross-section at low W decreases at large | cos \u03b8\u2217 |, while the\nopposite trend is observed in the higher W region. The transition point\nseems to occur at W \u2248 2.5 GeV 9 .\nAnother important consequence of the hard scattering picture is the\nhadron helicity conservation rule. For each exclusive reaction like \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304\nthe sum of the two initial helicities equals the sum of the two final ones.\nAccording to the simplification used in 11 , neglecting quark masses, quark\nand antiquark and hence proton and antiproton have to be in opposite\nhelicity states. If the (anti) proton is considered as a point-like particle,\nsimple QED rules determine the angular dependence of the unpolarized\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304 differential cross-section 17 :\n(1 + cos2 \u03b8\u2217 )\nd\u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp\u0304)\n\u221d\n.\nd| cos \u03b8\u2217 |\n(1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8\u2217 )\n\n(1)\n\nThis expression is compared to the OPAL 7 data in two W ranges,\n2.55 < W < 2.95 GeV (Fig. 3a) and 2.15 < W < 2.55 GeV (Fig. 3b).\nThe normalisation in each case is determined by the best fit to the data.\n\n\fOctober 6, 2018\n\n7:26\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nbarillari\n\n5\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp)/d| cos(\u0398 ) |(nb)\n\n3\na) OPAL 2.55<W<2.95 GeV\n\n2\n\n\u2217\n\nStandard DA\nAsymptotic DA\nDZ-DA\n\n2.5\n\n\u2217\n\nd\u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 pp)/d| cos(\u0398 ) |(nb)\n\nIn the higher W range, the prediction (1) is in agreement with the data\nwithin the experimental uncertainties.

For W > 2.5 GeV the two results are compatible inside\nthe large experimental errors. The cross-section measurement obtained by\nCLEO at lower W values is steeper that the one obtained by L3. The\nL3 18 data, fitted with a function of the form \u03c3 \u2248 W \u2212n , gives a value\nn = 7.6 \u00b1 3.9.
