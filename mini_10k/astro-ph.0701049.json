Analysis of the properties (e.g.,\nmass, spectral type) of such SN progenitors allows a direct comparison to theoretical\nexpectations based on the observed quantities of the SNe (e.g., light curves, spectral\nevolution).\nWhile observers have had some luck with ground-based observations, such as the\nidentifications of a \u223c 20 M\u2299 blue supergiant (BSG) star for the peculiar, subluminous Type\nII SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Gilmozzi et al. 1987; Sonneborn et al. 1987),\na \u223c 17 M\u2299 red supergiant (RSG), possibly in a binary system, for the Type IIb SN 1993J\nin M81 (Aldering et al. 1994; Van Dyk et al. 2002), and a 13\u201320 M\u2299 yellow supergiant\n(YSG) for the Type II-P SN 2004et in NGC 6946 (Li et al. 2005a, 2005b), most of the\nrecent progress in this field has been based on the rich archival data of the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) (Van Dyk et al. 2003a; Smartt et al. 2004; Maund & Smartt 2005; Maund\net al. 2005a; Li et al. 2006; Hendry et al. 2006; Gal-Yam et al. 2007). The superior\nspatial resolution of the HST images allows the SN progenitors to be isolated from their\nenvironments, and the deep limiting magnitude allows the SN progenitors to be detected in\nmore distant (but still relatively nearby) galaxies.\nIn this paper we report the identification of the progenitors on HST images of two\nnearby SNe in the Virgo cluster. K. Itagaki, a veteran Japanese amateur SN searcher,\ndiscovered both of these SNe: SN 2006my in NGC 4651 on 2006 Nov. 8.82 (UT dates\nare used throughout this paper) and SN 2006ov in M61 (NGC 4303) on 2006 Nov. 24.86\n(Nakano & Itagaki 2006a, 2006b). Unfortunately, the SN explosions occurred while the\ngalaxies were behind the Sun, and were only detected after becoming visible again in\nthe early morning, so the objects were discovered rather late in their evolution. Spectra\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nobtained soon after the time of discovery show that both SNe are of Type II: SN 2006my is\nsimilar to SN II-P 1999em (Hamuy et al. 2001; Leonard et al. 2002b; Elmhamdi et al. 2003)\nabout 1\u20132 months after maximum brightness (Stanishev & Nielsen 2006), and SN 2006ov,\nperhaps reddened, is similar to SN II-P 2005cs (Pastorello et al. 2006; Tak\u00e1ts & Vink\u00f3\n2006) roughly a month after maximum (Blondin et al. 2006) (see \u00a72 for a more detailed\ndiscussion of the age and reddening of both SNe).\nWe took ground-based images of the SNe with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\n(CFHT) under good seeing conditions (Figures 1 and 2), and are able to precisely (to within\n\u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 05 and 0.\u2032\u2032 11, for SNe 2006my and 2006ov, respectively) locate the site of both SNe on\npre-SN archival HST images of the host galaxies. We further obtained HST/ACS images\nof SN 2006ov itself and were able to pinpoint the SN site to within 0.\u2032\u2032 02. We identify a\n7\u201315 M\u2299 red supergiant (RSG) and a 12\u201320 M\u2299 RSG in the error circles of SNe 2006my\nand 2006ov, respectively, and propose these as the progenitors of the SNe. We note that\nNGC 4651 also produced SN 1987K, while M61 produced SNe 1926A, 1961I, 1964F, and\n1999gn.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we discuss the properties (type, age, and\nreddening) of both SNe, and demonstrate that they are of the Type II variety discovered\nnear the end of the plateau phase. In \u00a73 we report our identification of the progenitors in\nthe pre-SN HST/WFPC2 images. We describe the nature of the progenitors inferred from\nthe HST photometry in \u00a74. Further discussion is in \u00a75, and we summarize our conclusions\nin \u00a76.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov\n\nThere are several subclasses of SNe II (see Filippenko 1997 for a review of SN types).\nAmong these, the Type II-plateau (SNe II-P) are the most common, with the defining\nfeature being a prominent plateau phase in their optical light curve. The Type II-linear\n(SNe II-L) show a linear decline in magnitude after their maximum brightness, and are\nrelatively rare. The SN 1987A-like objects are subluminous and show a very broad peak\nin the light curve. The Type II-narrow (SNe IIn), which have relatively narrow spectral\nfeatures sometimes (but not always) superimposed on a broader component, are a more\nheterogeneous subclass than the others. Moreover, the Type IIb SNe, such as SN 1993J in\nM81 (Filippenko et al. 1993; Nomoto et al. 1993), manifest themselves as SNe II at early\ntimes, but then experience a spectroscopic metamorphosis into a SN Ib at late times (see\nSN 1987K, Filippenko 1988).\nThe different subclasses may have quite different progenitor systems. Thus in this\nsection, we study the photometric and spectroscopic behavior of SNe 2006my and 2006ov,\nto get an initial indication of their nature.\n\n2.1.\n\nPhotometry of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov\n\nWe followed SNe 2006my and 2006ov with the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging\nTelescope (KAIT; Li et al. 2000; Filippenko et al. 2001; Filippenko 2005) at Lick\nObservatory soon after their discoveries. KAIT, which conducts the successful Lick\nObservatory Supernova Search (LOSS), did not discover these two SNe because of its\nsearch strategy of focusing on near-meridian objects, and the two SNe were 2\u20133 hours east\nof the meridian at the end of the night when discovered by Itagaki. As both SNe were\ndiscovered at late times, we did not start an intense multi-color campaign of follow-up\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nobservations. Instead, the two SNe were imaged in unfiltered mode nearly nightly, with\noccasional broad-band BV RI photometry.\nAn advantage of observing with the unfiltered mode is that we have good pre-SN\nunfiltered template images for the SN host galaxies accumulated during the course of LOSS.\nThese templates enable us to perform galaxy subtraction, which significantly increases the\nphotometric accuracy as both SNe (especially SN 2006ov) are heavily contaminated by\nhost-galaxy emission. Here we report relative unfiltered photometry for SNe 2006my and\n2006ov, providing the necessary information on their photometric behavior (e.g., whether\nthey have a plateau or linear phase). A full treatment of all available follow-up data for\nthese SNe is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be discussed elsewhere.\nFor the unfiltered images of SNe 2006my and 2006ov, we first perform galaxy\nsubtraction with a customized software package. The SN image is registered to the pre-SN\nunfiltered template, their point spread functions (PSFs) are convolved to the same level, the\nintensities of the images are matched, and a final subtraction is performed. This procedure\nis essentially that used for processing unfiltered images by the LOSS SN search pipeline.\nWe use the IRAF7 DAOPHOT package (Stetson 1987) to perform standard aperture\nphotometry for the SNe and several bright stars in the field. A relative light curve is then\ngenerated by averaging the differences between the magnitudes of the SNe and the bright\nstars.\nAs the best match to broad-band filters for the KAIT unfiltered data is the R band\n(Li et al. 2003), in Figure 3 we compare our relative unfiltered light curves for SNe 2006my\n7\n\nIRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is distributed by the National Optical\n\nAstronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research\nin Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nand 2006ov to the R-band light curve of SN 1999em, a well-studied SN II-P (Leonard\net al. 2002b; Hamuy et al. 2001; Elmhamdi et al. 2003). The relative unfiltered light curves\nof the SNe are visually shifted by a constant to match the light curve of SN 1999em. Figure\n3 indicates a good match between SN 1999em and SN 2006my: the behavior of the decline\nfrom the plateau is almost identical for both SNe. There is no doubt that SN 2006ov is\na SN II-P as well, because it shows a prominent plateau phase. However, it has a steeper\ndecline from the plateau than do SNe 1999em and 2006my.\nThus, SN 2006my and SN 2006ov behave like SNe II-P discovered near the end of their\nplateau phase. The duration of the plateau phase of SNe II-P, however, varies significantly.\nFrom a sample of 13 SNe II-P studied by Hamuy (2003), Hendry et al. (2005) derived a\nmean plateau duration of 131 \u00b1 21 days, with a range of 110 to 170 days. Consequently, it is\nunclear which SN exploded first, SN 2006my or SN 2006ov. Although SN 2006my appears\nto be farther along the plateau than SN 2006ov on the same date, SN 2006ov could have\nhad a longer plateau phase and thus exploded earlier.\nOur estimate of the age of SNe 2006my and 2006ov at the time of discovery (\u223c3\nmonths after explosion) is somewhat older than the ages suggested by other groups based\non spectra: \u223c1\u20132 months for SN 2006my (Stanishev & Nielsen 2006), and \u223c1 month for SN\n2006ov (Blondin et al. 2006). Next, we will check our own spectra to provide further age\nestimates for both SNe, and attempt to constrain the reddening toward them.\n\n2.2.\n\nSpectroscopy of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov\n\nWe obtained three optical spectra of SNe 2006my and 2006ov with the Keck 10-m\ntelescopes using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995),\nand with the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope using the Kast double spectrograph\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(Miller & Stone 1993). A journal of observations is given in Table 1. All one-dimensional\nsky-subtracted spectra were extracted optimally in the usual manner (e.g., Foley et al.\n2003). For the Kast observations, flatfields for the red-side CCD were taken at the position\nof the object to reduce near-infrared fringing effects. The spectra were corrected for\natmospheric extinction and telluric bands (Bessell 1999; Matheson et al. 2000), and then\nflux-calibrated using standard stars observed at similar airmass on the same night as the\nSNe.\nIn Figure 4 we show a comparison of the spectra of SNe 2006my and 2006ov to those\nof other well-studied SNe II-P at similar epochs. The spectra of SNe 2004dj and 2003gd\nare previously unpublished data from our own spectral database. All spectra in Figure 4\nhave been corrected for the reddening toward the SNe and also for the host-galaxy redshift.\nFor SN 2003gd, we adopt E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.13 mag, and an explosion date of 2003 March 17\n(Van Dyk, Li, & Filippenko 2003). For SN 2004dj, we adopt E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.07 mag, and an\nexplosion date of 2004 June 30 (Zhang et al. 2005; Vink\u00f3 et al. 2006). We emphasize that\nboth SNe 2003gd and 2004dj were discovered in the middle of the plateau phase, so their\nexplosion dates have relatively large uncertainties due to the large scatter in the plateau\ndurations. Only the Galactic reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.027 mag and 0.022 mag (Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner, & Davis 1998) were removed from the spectra of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov,\nrespectively.\nFigure 4 demonstrates a striking similarity between the spectra of SN 2006my and\nSN 2006ov, as well as their resemblance to the spectra of SNe 2004dj and 2003gd at 3\u20134\nmonths after explosion. Other signs of a relatively old age for these SNe II-P are the strong,\nrelatively narrow, Ca II near-IR triplet (one sees the 8498 \u00c5 and 8662 \u00c5 components, with\nthe 8542 \u00c5 component blended within), and hints of the [Ca II] \u03bb\u03bb7291, 7324 and [Fe II]\n\u03bb7155 lines often seen in SNe II-P during the nebular phase.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe spectra in Figure 4 also show that with just the corrections for Galactic reddening,\nthe spectra of SNe 2006my and 2006ov have a continuum shape similar to that of the other\ntwo SNe II-P. This argues against the existence of large host-galaxy reddening toward either\nSN 2006my or SN 2006ov. Blondin et al. (2006), however, suggested that SN 2006ov is\nreddened (but they did not quote an estimate of the amount of the host-galaxy reddening).\nA possible cause of this discrepancy may be that Blondin et al. compared their spectrum of\nSN 2006ov to that of a SN II-P at a much earlier phase (\u223c1 month after explosion) than\nour estimated age (\u223c3 months after explosion). As SNe II-P become progressively redder\nat later times, comparing the spectrum of an older SN II-P to a younger object would give\nthe incorrect impression that the older object is reddened.\nTo further investigate the reddening, in Figure 5 we plot a close-up of the spectral\nrange near the Na I D absorption lines of both SN 2006my and SN 2006ov. It is expected\nthat reddening caused by the dust in a galaxy would produce noticeable narrow Na I D\nabsorption lines in an object's spectrum, although the quantitative correlation between the\nstrength of Na I D absorption and the amount of reddening is still quite uncertain. Figure 5\nshows no signs of prominent, narrow Na I D at the rest wavelengths corresponding to either\nthe Milky Way Galaxy or the hosts (a hint of narrow Na I D absorption due to the Milky\nWay Galaxy might be present in the spectrum of SN 2006ov). We conclude that there is no\nevidence for significant host-galaxy reddening of either SN 2006my and SN 2006ov.\nThe photometry and spectroscopy of SNe 2006my and 2006ov indicate that both\nobjects are SNe II-P discovered near the end of the plateau phase. We now turn to\nthe analysis of the archival HST data available for NGC 4651 and M61, identifying the\nprogenitors of both SNe and studying the environments of the progenitors.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.\n\nThe Progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov in Archival HST Images\n\nTables 2 and 3 list the pre-SN archival HST/WFPC2 data available for the host\ngalaxies of SN 2006my (NGC 4651) and SN 2006ov (M61). There are also STIS, NICMOS,\nand ACS/HRC data for M61, but the actual site of SN 2006ov was not observed in those\ncases. For the HST/WFPC2 data, the site of SN 2006my was imaged in the F555W and\nF814W filters (Table 2), while the site of SN 2006ov was imaged in the F450W, F606W,\nand F814W filters (Table 3). (Hereafter, we will refer to these images by their filter names.)\nWe downloaded the HST/WFPC2 data for NGC 4651 and M61 from the HST Multimission\nArchive8 , and analyzed them with the STSDAS software package. Cosmic-ray hits in the\nCR-split images were removed using the task CRREJ, and the images on the four individual\nWFPC2 chips were combined in a mosaic using the task WMOSAIC.\nIt is essential to locate with high astrometric precision the SN sites in the pre-SN\nHST/WFPC2 images. For this purpose, we obtained high-resolution (0.\u2032\u2032 187 pixel\u22121 ) images\nof SNe 2006my and 2006ov with the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT +\nMegaCam) in the Sloan r \u2032 band under fair to excellent seeing conditions (full width at\nhalf-maximum intensity about 0.\u2032\u2032 6\u20131.\u2032\u2032 0). A summary of these CFHT data is given in Table\n4.\n\n3.1.\n\nAstrometric Solution for NGC 4651 and SN 2006my\n\nWe attempted to match the CFHT r \u2032 -band images of SN 2006my to the mosaic F814W\nimage of NGC 4651. Both sets of CFHT images give consistent results, and here we present\nthe results from the 2006 Dec. 24 image due to its superior depth and seeing. We identified\n8\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n20 stars (or compact star clusters) present in both the CFHT and WFPC2 images for which\nwe were able to precisely measure the (X, Y) center positions. Then, using the IRAF task\nGEOMAP, we performed a geometrical transformation between the two sets of coordinates,\n\u2032\u2032\nand were able to match them to <\n\u223c 0.98 WFC pixel root-mean-square (1\u03c3 <\n\u223c 0. 098). As the\n\nmosaic process involves some uncertainties caused by geometrical distortions and chip gaps\namong the four individual WFPC2 chips, we further attempted to match the CFHT image\nto the Chip 2 (WFC2) F814W image (where the SN site is located) before the image was\nmosaiced. 13 common stars were identified, with a geometrical transformation uncertainty\n\u2032\u2032\nof 0.45 pixel (1\u03c3 <\n\u223c 0. 045).\n\nThe SN position measured on the CFHT image was then transformed to the WFPC2\nimage. The transformed SN locations based on the geometrical transformation using the\nmosaic image and the individual WFC2 image are consistent with each other within the\nuncertainties, and we adopt the SN location based on the WFC2 chip image.\nFigure 6 shows a 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 close-up of the SN 2006my environment in the WFPC2 images\n(the F555W image has the same pointing as the F814W image). The white circles in Figure\n6 have a radius of 0.\u2032\u2032 225 (5 \u00d7 1\u03c3 error). Within the 1\u03c3 error circle, there is an apparent\nsource in the F814W image, but no apparent point sources are visible in the F555W image.\nFigure 6 also shows the images with a resampled resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 05/pixel (a cubic spline\nfunction is used to interpolate one pixel into 2 \u00d7 2 pixels). As can be seen, resampling the\ndata brings out more details in the undersampled WFPC2 data, and the red source within\nthe error radius of the F814W image is more easily discerned. We note that resampling the\ndata has the risk of smoothing several (extended) sources into a point source, but in this\ncase the point source is apparent in the original image as well.\nIn both the original and the resampled images, the source appears to have a slight\neast-west extension. It is unclear whether this source is actually a blending of two stars,\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ngiven the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the detection, and given the low\nspatial resolution of HST/WFPC2 at the distance of NGC 4651. The probability of two\nRSGs occurring in adjacent pixels on the WFC2 image, however, is very small considering\nthe density of such stars in the environment of SN 2006my (0.4%, not including possible\nphysical clustering of massive stars; see discussion in \u00a75). We consider this source as a\nsingle star, and the likely progenitor of SN 2006my. The nature of this source is further\ndiscussed in \u00a74.\nIn the original non-mosaic HST/WFPC2 images, the SN site is located at (X, Y) =\n(410.61, 158.81) on Chip 2 (WFC2), with a 1\u03c3 error circle radius of 0.45 pixel. We note that\nthese coordinates are in the IRAF system, and need to be adjusted in some other software\npackages. For example, the photometry packages Dophot and HSTphot use a coordinate\nsystem that differs from that of IRAF by 0.5 pixel in both X and Y. In HSTphot, which\nwe use to reduce the HST/WFPC2 data in this paper, the SN site is located at (X, Y) =\n(410.11, 158.31) on the WFC2 chip.\n\n3.2.\n\nAstrometric Solution for M61 and SN 2006ov\n\nWe first attempted an astrometric solution for M61 and SN 2006ov between the\nCFHT and the pre-SN HST/WFPC2 F814W images. 25 common stars were used in\nIRAF/GEOMAP to do a geometrical transformation with a precision of 1\u03c3 <\n\u223c 1.10 WFC\npixel (0.\u2032\u2032 11), due to the mediocre seeing of the CFHT image. Nontheless, after mapping\nthe SN position from the CFHT image onto the pre-SN F814W image, we identified a\npossible progenitor within the 1\u03c3 error radius, which is subsequently verified by the better\nastrometric solution described below.\nTo further improve the astrometric solution, we took images of SN 2006ov with\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nHST/ACS on 2006 Dec. 12, as part of SNAP program GO-10877 (PI: W. Li). The details\nof the observations are listed in Table 5. The ACS images were observed with the High\nResolution Channel (HRC) of ACS with a spatial resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 025 pixel\u22121 and a field of\nview of 29\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 25\u2032\u2032 . We identified 12 common stars in the ACS/HRC F625W image and the\nChip 4 (WFC4) pre-SN WFPC2 F814W image (where the SN site is located), and achieved\nan astrometric solution with a 1\u03c3 error of 0.17 WFC pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 017) (Figure 7). The F450W\nimage has the same pointing as the F814W image, but the F606W image does not. An\nastrometric solution between the ACS/HRC F625W image and the Chip 4 (WFC4) WFPC2\nF606W image (where the SN site is located) using 9 common stars yields a precision with\na 1\u03c3 uncertainty of 0.16 WFC pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 016). Using these astrometric solutions, the SN\nposition measured in the ACS/HRC F625W image is mapped onto the pre-SN WFPC2\nimages.\nFigure 8 shows the 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 close-up of the SN 2006ov environment in the WFPC2\nimages. To guide the eye, white circles with a radius of 20 times the 1\u03c3 uncertainty of\nthe astrometric registration are marked. Within the very small 1\u03c3 error circle, there is an\napparent source in the F814W image, which we identify as the progenitor of SN 2006ov. A\nhint of this source can also be seen in the F606W image, although it appears somewhat\nextended. There are also some faint sources near the center of the error circle in the F450W\nimage, but they appear to be offset from the progenitor in the F814W image. A bright\nsource is seen to the northeast of the progenitor in all three bands. It looks stellar in the\nF814W image, but is somewhat extended in the F606W and F450W images, perhaps due\nto blending with another source. It is also possible that the source is actually a small star\ncluster. The presence of this bright source complicates the analysis of the photometry of\nthe progenitor of SN 2006ov, as we further discuss in \u00a74.\nIn the pre-SN HST/WFPC2 F450W and F814W images, the SN site is located at\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n(X, Y) = (571.62, 236.22) on Chip 4 (WFC4), with a 1\u03c3 error circle of 0.17 pixel. In the\nF606W image, it is at (X, Y) = (227.44, 267.34) on Chip 4 (WFC4), with a 1\u03c3 error circle\nof 0.16 pixel. In the HSTphot coordinate system, these positions are (X, Y) = (571.12,\n235.72) for the F450W and F814W images, and (X, Y) = (226.94, 266.84) for the F606W\nimage.\n\n4.\n\nThe Nature of the Progenitors of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov\n\nWe have identified the likely progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov in pre-SN\nHST/WFPC2 images. In this section, we study the nature of these objects based on their\nmagnitudes and colors.\n\n4.1.\n\nPhotometry of the Supernova Progenitors\n\nWe used the software package HSTphot (Dolphin 2000a, 2000b) to conduct photometry\nof the HST/WFPC2 images of SNe 2006my and 2006ov. HSTphot automatically accounts\nfor WFPC2 PSF variations and charge-transfer effects across the chips, zeropoints, aperture\ncorrections, etc. There are many option flags to run HSTphot. For our reduction, we chose\nto include Option 2 (turn on local sky determination) as recommended by the HSTphot\nmanual for images of galaxies well beyond the Local Group, and Option 8 (turn off aperture\ncorrections) as there are no good aperture correction stars in our images. HSTphot then\nuses the default aperture corrections for the filters, which are probably accurate in general\nto 0.02 mag. We also used an independent detection threshold of 2.5\u03c3 (minimum S/N for a\ngiven image or filter for star detection), and a total detection threshold of 3.0\u03c3 (minimum\ntotal S/N for a star to be kept in the final output). All photometry was performed on the\ncoadded images in each filter.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nTable 6 lists the HSTphot photometry for the progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov.\nColumns 2 and 3 list the SN location as predicted by the astrometric solutions (\u00a73).\nColumns 4 and 5 list the coordinates of the detected sources near the SN location in\nHSTphot. From the magnitudes of all 3\u03c3 detections in the images, we also empirically\ndetermined the limiting magnitude near the SN sites in the images, and listed them in\nColumn 9 (Lmag) of Table 6. These limiting magnitudes are different (\u223c0.5 to 1.0 mag\nshallower) from the values calculated with the WFPC2 ETC on the HST website9 , as the\nSN sites are located on a bright stellar background.\nFor SN 2006my in NGC 4651, HSTphot detected a 5.6\u03c3 source close to (<\n\u223c 0.43 pixel),\nand within the 1\u03c3 error of, the predicted SN location in the F814W image, with a flight\nsystem magnitude of F814W = 24.47 \u00b1 0.20. For the F555W image, HSTphot failed to\ndetect any source within the 1\u03c3 error radius (the closest detection is an extended source\nnear the \u223c 2\u03c3 error radius). Inspection of Figure 5 indicates that there is no apparent point\nsource within the 1\u03c3 error radius. As HSTphot has an option to accept pre-determined\nstar lists, we enforced HSTphot to make a measurement at the position of the progenitor\nas measured by HSTphot in the F814W image; this yielded a 2.2\u03c3 detection with a flight\nsystem magnitude of F555W = 26.66 \u00b1 0.55. As this F555W magnitude is fainter than the\n3\u03c3 limit (F555W < 26.5 mag) of the image, we consider the progenitor to be not detected\nin the F555W image, and use the 3\u03c3 limiting magnitude (V < 26.5 mag) as the upper limit\nfor the V -band flux of the progenitor.\nFor SN 2006ov in M61, HSTphot failed to detect any sources within the 1\u03c3 error\nradius of the SN location in the F814W image. Lowering the total detection threshold to\n2\u03c3 did not help. Inspection of the residual image generated by HSTphot after subtracting\nthe PSFs of all positive detections, however, reveals an apparent source close to the known\n9\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfpc2/software/wfpc2-etc.html\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nSN location. Contamination by the bright source to the northeast of the SN location is a\npossible explanation for the failure by HSTphot to make a detection of the central source\nin the error circle.\nSince we have an accurate (1\u03c3 = 0.17 pixel) position for the putative progenitor of SN\n2006ov as determined from the ACS/HRC to WFPC2 astrometric registration, we forced\nHSTphot to make a measurement at the progenitor position. This procedure yielded a 6.1\u03c3\ndetection with F814W = 23.19 \u00b1 0.18 mag, and a residual image with all sources within\nthe 1\u03c3 error radius cleanly removed. We further forced HSTphot to make a measurement\nat the progenitor position in the F450W and F606W images. We measured a 2.2\u03c3 source\nwith F606W = 24.07 \u00b1 0.50, and a 6.1\u03c3 source with F450W = 23.51 \u00b1 0.18 mag. Although\nthe detection in the F606W image is of low S/N (2.2\u03c3) due to possible blending from other\nsources, the measured magnitude (F606W = 24.07 \u00b1 0.50 mag) is brighter than the 3\u03c3\nlimiting magnitude (F606W < 25.3 mag), and inspection of Figure 8 suggests a hint of\nthe progenitor in the F606W image, so we kept the F606W detection as it is. The 6.1\u03c3\ndetection in the F450W image is likely caused by another source; as previously noted, it\nappears to be offset from the progenitor in the F814W image. Moreover, if it were indeed\nthe progenitor, then the spectral energy distribution would be unrealistic, with a red V \u2212 I\ncolor and a blue B \u2212 V color. We assume that, because of the spatial offset, this blue source\ndoes not substantially affect our V and I measurements of the putative progenitor, though\nthere might be some contamination.\nThe flight-system magnitudes were then transformed to the standard broad-band\nBV RI system following the prescriptions by Holtzman et al. (1995) and Dolphin (2000b),\nand are listed in Column 8 (Mag2) of Table 6.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nProperties of the Supernova Progenitors\n\nWe can estimate the masses of the progenitor stars by comparing the intrinsic colors\nand absolute magnitudes of the objects with stellar evolution tracks of massive stars having\ndifferent zero-age main-sequence masses (MZAMS ). In \u00a74.1 we measured the apparent\nmagnitudes of the possible progenitors (see Table 6 for a summary). To estimate the\nabsolute magnitudes of the progenitors, we need to know the distances to NGC 4651 and\nM61.\nFor NGC 4651, Solanes et al. (2002) collected 7 distance measurements derived by\ndifferent groups using the Tully-Fisher (T-F) method, and reported an average distance\nmodulus of \u03bc = 31.74 \u00b1 0.25 mag. Terry, Paturel, & Ekholm (2002) reported a \"sosie\ngalaxy\" T-F distance of \u03bc = 31.86 \u00b1 0.17 mag. We adopt \u03bc = 31.8 \u00b1 0.3 mag as a possible\ndistance to NGC 4651.\nFor M61, the T-F distance published by Tully (1988) is \u03bc = 30.91 mag, while Sch\u00f6niger\n& Sofue (1997) reported a CO and H I T-F distance of \u03bc = 30.12 \u00b1 0.10 mag. We adopt\n\u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.4 mag as a possible distance to M61.\nBoth NGC 4651 and M61 may be members of the Virgo cluster (VC), one of the\nnearest rich clusters in the northern hemisphere with over 1300 member galaxies, so we also\nattempted to use the measured distance to the VC as the distance of both NGC 4651 and\nM61. The VC, however, is quite extended in size and has complicated three-dimensional\nstructure. The two main components are the somewhat more nearby, northern, M87\nsubcluster (dominated by early-type galaxies), and the somewhat more distant, southern,\nM49 galaxy concentration (rich in spiral galaxies). Currently, there is a total of 8 VC spiral\ngalaxies with Cepheid distances (NGC 4496A, NGC 4536, NGC 4548, NGC 4321, NGC\n4535, NGC 4639, NGC 4527, NGC 4414; see the summary by Freedman et al. 2001), and\ntheir average distance is \u03bc = 31.03 \u00b1 0.12 mag. A recent B-band T-F distance measurement\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nto 51 VC spiral galaxies yields \u03bc = 31.28 \u00b1 0.14 mag (Fouque et al. 2001). Two recent\nsurface brightness fluctuation (SBF) measurements to the elliptical galaxies in the VC yield\n\u03bc = 31.09 \u00b1 0.15 mag (Tonry et al. 2001; Jerjen et al. 2004). The distance to the VC galaxy\nIC 3338 using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method gives \u03bc = 30.98 \u00b1 0.19 mag\n(Harris et al. 1998). Here we adopt \u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.2 mag as the average distance to VC. To\naccount for the line-of-sight diameter of the VC, we further adopt \u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag as\nanother possible distance to both NGC 4651 and M61.\nWe also note that NGC 4651 is \u223c4 degrees north of the M87 subcluster, while M61 is\n\u223c8 degrees south of the M87 subcluster (and thus possibly a member of the M49 subcluster).\nAt face value, our adopted individual distances of NGC 4651 and M61 (\u03bc = 31.8 \u00b1 0.3 mag\nand 30.5 \u00b1 0.4 mag, respectively) contradict the depicted structure of the VC: NGC 4651 is\nin the more nearby northern region but it has a larger adopted distance than the average\nVC, M61 is in the more distance southern subcluster but it has a smaller adopted distance\nthan the average VC. As discussed by Pilyugin, V\u0131\u0301lchez, & Contini (2004), however, it\nseems impossible to check the distance of individual VC galaxies by comparing their value\nwith the \"group\" distance, largely because of the complicated three-dimensional structure\nof the cluster.\nThe evolutionary tracks of massive stars on the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are\nsignificantly affected by the adopted metallicity, so we attempt to constrain the metallicity\nof the sites of SNe 2006my and 2006ov by using information from the literature. From the\nCFHT images, we measured that SN 2006my is 27.\u2032\u2032 4 west and 22.\u2032\u2032 1 south of the nucleus of\nNGC 4651, and that SN 2006ov is 6.\u2032\u2032 1 east and 51.\u2032\u20321 north of the nucleus of M61. With these\noffsets, the galaxy position angle and the inclination angle from LEDA10 , and the published\nmetallicity and its radial gradient in NGC 4651 and M61 by Polyugin et al. (2004), we\n10\n\nhttp://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nderived the relative oxygen abundance log(O/H) + 12 = 8.51 \u00b1 0.06 dex and 8.64 \u00b1 0.10\ndex for the sites of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov, respectively. These metalicities are lower\nthan the solar value (8.8 dex; Grevesse & Sauval 1998), so we adopt a subsolar metallicity\nof Z = 0.008 for the environment of both SNe.\nFigure 9 shows the (V \u2212 I)0 vs. MI0 CMD for the progenitor of SN 2006my in NGC\n4651, compared with model stellar evolution tracks for a range of masses from Lejeune &\nSchaerer (2001), assuming enhanced mass loss for the most massive stars and a metallicity of\nZ = 0.008. We have corrected the magnitudes of the progenitor with the Galactic reddening\nonly [E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.027 mag], as discussed in \u00a72.2. The uncertainties in the photometry\nand the distance are added in quadrature to produce the final uncertainty for the absolute\nmagnitude. As a result of only an upper limit to the brightness of the progenitor in the V\nband, we have a lower limit to the (V \u2212 I)0 color, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 9.\nThe filled square represents the data with an adopted distance modulus of \u03bc = 31.8 \u00b1 0.3\nmag. From the location of the progenitor on the CMD, MZAMS = 11\u201315 M\u2299 is estimated.\nThe filled circle represents the data when the average VC distance (\u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag) is\nused, which suggests MZAMS = 7\u201312 M\u2299 .\nFigure 10 shows the (V \u2212 I)0 vs. MI0 CMD for the progenitor of SN 2006ov in M61,\nafter correcting the magnitudes of the progenitor with the Galactic reddening of E(B \u2212 V )\n= 0.022 mag. Adopting \u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.4 mag, the MZAMS estimate for the progenitor is 13\u201317\nM\u2299 . With the average VC distance (\u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag), we find MZAMS = 15\u201319 M\u2299 .\nFigure 11 shows the (V \u2212 I)0 vs. MV0 CMD for the same object. The MZAMS estimate for\nthe progenitor is 12\u201317 M\u2299 and 14\u201320 M\u2299 for our two choices of the distance, respectively.\nIt is clear that the adopted distances to the galaxies have a relatively large impact\non the derived progenitor masses. As a byproduct of the CMD study, we provide an\nindependent constraint on the distances to NGC 4651 and NGC 4303 from the global stellar\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nphotometry on the HST images. For SN 2006my, we measured the photometry of all the\nstars (with S/N >\n\u223c 3) on the four WFPC2 chips on the F555W and F814W images, and\nplotted their magnitudes on the (V \u2212 I)0 vs. MI0 CMD with an adopted distance to NGC\n4651. The isochrones of the stellar evolutionary tracks from Lejeune & Schaerer (2001)\nare then plotted on the CMD to see whether they are a good fit to the data. Although\nthis method is plagued by the need to adopt a global metallicity for all the stars (while in\nreality they should come from a range of metallicities from different regions of NGC 4651),\npossible contamination of compact stellar clusters in the photometry, and no reddening\ncorrections, it nevertheless suggests that \u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag (the average VC distance)\nprovides a better fit to the data than the average T-F distances ( \u03bc = 31.8 \u00b1 0.3). For SN\n2006ov, the F450W and F814W images were used to derive a (B \u2212 I)0 vs. MI0 CMD, and\nthe data favor the average T-F distance (\u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.4 mag) over the average VC distance\n(\u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag). The global metallicity was adopted as solar for both galaxies, even\nthough the SN sites are subsolar.\nOwing to the relatively large uncertainties in the distance estimates, our conservative\napproach is to adopt the progenitor masses as derived from the distances favored by the\nCMD study (\u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag for SN 2006my, and \u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.4 mag for SN 2006ov),\nbut allow the errorbars to cover the range of progenitor masses from the other distance\nestimate. This gives MZAMS = 10+5\n\u22123 M\u2299 for the progenitor of SN 2006my in NGC 4651, and\n15+5\n\u22123 M\u2299 for the progenitor of SN 2006ov in M61. Both progenitors have a red color, albeit\nwith a large uncertainty. Their locations on the CMDs suggest that the progenitor of SN\n2006my is a RSG, while the progenitor of SN 2006ov is consistent with either a RSG or a\nYSG.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nProgenitors of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov\n\nWe have located the sites of SNe 2006my and 2006ov to high precision on pre-SN\nHST/WFPC2 images, and identified the likely progenitor stars of both SNe. As can be\nseen in Figures 1 and 2, both SNe occurred on a spiral arm of their host galaxies, and their\nimmediate environments are heavily contaminated by host-galaxy emission (more so for SN\n2006ov than SN 2006my). Even at HST/WFPC2 resolution (Figures 5 and 8), there are\nmany sources in the SN environments. It is thus possible that the objects we identified\nin the error circles are just RSGs that happened to be close to the SN explosion, but are\ncompletely unrelated.\nThe confidence of the progenitor identifications can be strengthened if we put stringent\nlimits on the non-detection of the progenitors. Using the limiting magnitudes in Table 5,\nwe place the following mass limits if the progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov were not\ndetected in the HST/WFPC2 F814W images: MZAMS <\n\u223c 11 M\u2299 or 8 M\u2299 for the SN 2006my\nprogenitor, when \u03bc = 31.8 \u00b1 0.3 mag and \u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag are adopted for NGC 4651,\nrespectively; MZAMS <\n\u223c 9 M\u2299 or 13 M\u2299 for the SN 2006ov progenitor, when \u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.4\nmag and \u03bc = 31.1 \u00b1 0.5 mag are adopted for M61, respectively. These mass limits are\nnot very restrictive, unfortunately, as several of the previously identified progenitors for\nSNe II-P have masses in the range 8\u201313 M\u2299 (Van Dyk et al. 2003a; Smartt et al. 2004;\nMaund et al. 2005a; Li et al. 2006; Hendry et al. 2006). Hence, there exists the possibility\nthat the progenitors of SN 2006my and/or SN 2006ov were not detected.\nThe probability of a chance coincidence (that is, the objects we identified are unrelated\nRSGs that happened to be within the error circles) can be further assessed by studying\nthe density of RSGs in the SN environments. Within a 1.\u2032\u2032 0 radius (approximately 80 pc\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nat our adopted average VC distance), we identified 6 possible RSGs (8 possible RSGs) in\nthe neighborhood of SN 2006my (SN 2006ov) by noting their absolute magnitudes and\ncolors on the CMDs. The probability of a RSG within the 0.\u2032\u2032 045 (0.\u2032\u2032 02) error radius is thus\n1.2% (0.2%). The small probability (0.2%) of a chance coincidence for the progenitor of SN\n2006ov solidifies our identification. While the probability of a chance coincidence for the\nprogenitor of SN 2006my is also small (1.2%), the confidence of our progenitor identification\ncan be further increased if we can significantly reduce the astrometric error radius.\nIn \u00a73.1 we also mentioned a possible blending issue for the progenitor of SN 2006my.\nUsing the RSG density in the environment of SN 2006my, the chance of two RSGs occurring\nin adjacent WFC pixels (0.\u2032\u2032 1) is only 0.4%, assuming that massive stars don't tend to\noccur in clusters. (The probability of blending would increase somewhat if the tendency of\nmassive stars to occur in associations were included, but it would still likely be relatively\nlow.)\nThe two main reasons for the large mass range of our identified progenitors are (a) the\nuncertain distances to the galaxies, and (b) the large photometric uncertainty due to the\nlow S/N of the detections. When more accurate distances for the galaxies (e.g., Cepheid\ndistances) become available, the masses of the progenitors will be further constrained. The\nsecond problem highlights the difficulty in directly identifying progenitors of SNe: they are\nfaint beyond the Local Group, and the pre-SN HST archival images often do not have the\noptimal combination of filters and depth because most of them were obtained by various\nobservers for different projects. A dedicated HST program to image the most nearby\ngalaxies would give observers a chance to identify the progenitors of most core-collapse SNe\nin these galaxies, further advancing our understanding of the death of massive stars.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nThe Nature of Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors\n\nOur identified progenitors of SN 2006my and SN 2006ov increase the number of\ndirectly detected progenitors for genuine SNe from 7 to 9. The first half of Table 6 lists the\ninferred masses of these progenitors. The progenitors of several probable super-outbursts of\nluminous blue variables (LBVs) misclassified as SNe, such as SN 1961V (Zwicky 1964) and\nSN 1997bs (Van Dyk et al. 1999b, 2000), have been identified but are not listed.\nThe second half of Table 6 gives the mass limits for the progenitors of several\ncore-collapse SNe. For these SNe, the progenitors are not directly identified, but a mass\nlimit is derived based on the limiting magnitudes of pre-SN images. In particular, SN 2004dj\noccurred in a compact star cluster (CSC), and the mass of the progenitor is estimated\nfrom the properties (luminosity and color) of the CSC (Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz et al. 2004; Wang\net al. 2005). SN 2005gl is associated with a very luminous (MV = \u221210.3 \u00b1 0.2 mag) source\n(Gal-Yam et al. 2007), which could be a very massive single star (e.g., an LBV) or a CSC.\nThere is also some uncertainty regarding the exact type of the SN: while a very early-time\nspectrum showed narrow hydrogen lines typical of SNe IIn, its later spectral evolution is\nmore typical of normal SNe II, perhaps a SN II-L.\nIt is clear from Table 6 that observers have had the most success identifying progenitors\nfor SNe II-P (7 out of 9). The main reason for this is perhaps the relative frequency of\ndifferent types of SNe. A preliminary analysis indicates that out of the 68 core-collapse\nSNe discovered by LOSS within 30 Mpc in the past 9 years, 46 are SNe II (most of which\nare SNe II-P), 18 are SNe Ib/c, 1 is a SN IIb, and 3 are SNe IIn. SNe II-P are thus by\nfar the most common type of core-collapse SN. Still, it is a bit surprising that no direct\nprogenitor has been detected for a SN Ib/c, given that they are roughly 40% as frequent as\nSNe II from the LOSS statistics. One factor is perhaps the low luminosity of the possible\nprogenitors for SNe Ib/c, which also limits the progenitors to be either relatively low-mass\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nstripped stars in binary systems, or single Wolf-Rayet stars.\nThe inferred masses for the progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov are consistent with\nthe trend that SNe II-P come from low-mass (8\u201320 M\u2299 ) RSGs, as previously suggested (Li\net al. 2006; Hendry et al. 2006). In total, there are now 7 directly identified progenitors for\nSNe II-P, all with MZAMS <\n\u223c 20M\u2299 . The statistics are growing, and suggest that perhaps\nall SNe II-P come from low-mass RSGs. If this is true, stars more massive than \u223c 20 M\u2299\nmay have a different evolutionary path, and explode as other types of SNe such as SNe II-L\nor SNe IIn. The possible association of the SN IIn/II-L 2005gl with a very massive single\nstar (Gal-Yam et al. 2007) is in agreement with this speculation. In the future, when a\nvery massive star explodes as a SN in a nearby galaxy (a rare event), observers may have a\nchance to study both the massive star and the SN in detail. Until then, the fate of the very\nmassive stars (MZAMS > 20M\u2299 ) still needs to be observationally verified.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\n1. Both SN 2006my in NGC 4651 and SN 2006ov in M61 are SNe II-P discovered\n3\u20134 months after explosion. Their spectra show no evidence of strong host-galaxy\nreddening.\n2. We obtained high-quality ground-based CFHT images for both SNe, and were able to\nlocate the SN sites to high precision on the pre-SN HST/WFPC2 images (astrometric\nuncertainty 1\u03c3 = 0.\u2032\u2032 045 and 0.\u2032\u2032 11 for SNe 2006my and 2006ov, respectively). We\nfurther improved the astrometric solution to 1\u03c3 = 0.\u2032\u2032 02 for SN 2006ov with HST/ACS\nimages of the SN. Within each error circle, we identified a likely progenitor of each\nSN.\n3. Photometric analysis suggests that the progenitor of SN 2006my has\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n+5\nMZAMS = 10+5\n\u22123 M\u2299 , and the progenitor for SN 2006ov has MZAMS = 15\u22123\n\nM\u2299 . There is a small probability (1.2% and 0.2%, respectively) that the object we\nidentified as the progenitor is caused by chance coincidence.\n4. The inferred masses for the possible progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov are\nconsistent with the trend that the most common core-collapse SNe II-P arise from\nstars with MZAMS in the range 8\u201320 M\u2299 .\n\nWe thank Louis Desroches, Mohan Ganeshalingam, Jennifer Hoffman, Douglas Leonard,\nFrank Serduke, Jeffery Silverman, and Diane Wong for obtaining and reducing the optical\nspectra of SNe used in this paper with the 3-m Shane reflector at Lick Observatory.

The photometry of SNe 2006my and 2006ov was\nperformed on unfiltered images, and the data were visually shifted by a constant to match\nSN 1999em (whose light curve is plotted as a solid line). Dates of some observations are\nmarked. Both SNe show characteristics of SNe II-P discovered near the end of the plateau\nphase.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Comparison of the spectra of SNe 2006my and 2006ov to those of other well-studied\nSNe II-P at similar epochs.
