The real part of the amplitude, when extrapolated from above\nthreshold to below threshold, is found to vanish at a positive non-zero value of the total\ninvariant mass of the system, in agreement with predictions from perturbative chiral models.\nIn our exact analytic expression, the total amplitude vanishes identically at zero invariant\nmass.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Resonance-Spectrum Expansion (RSE) has been developed [1] for the description of mesonmeson scattering resonances and bound states, in a non-perturbative approach that aims at\nunquenching the q q\u0304 confinement spectrum. It consists of a simple analytic expression which can\nbe straightfrowardly applied to all possible non-exotic systems of two mesons. The RSE goes\nbeyond simple spectroscopy, since it describes the scattering amplitude, not only at a resonance,\nbut also for energies where no resonance exists. In contrast to models which have to rely upon\nnumerical methods of solution, the RSE has the additional advantage that the pole structure of\nits scattering amplitude can be studied in great detail, owing to its closed analytic form. The\nexpression for the amplitude can even be analytically continued, in an exact manner, to below\nthe lowest threshold, where bound states show up as poles on the real energy axis. The RSE\neasily handles many coupled meson-meson channels, or coupled systems with different internal\nflavours. As such, it is an ideal expression for the study of scattering theory in general, i.e., the\n1\n\n\fstudy of resonance structures and their relation to some of the many S-matrix singularities, as\nwell as the concept of Riemann sheets and analytic continuation anywhere in the complex energy\nplane. Moreover, it is particularly powerful in examining the properties of scattering amplitudes\nnear the lowest threshold, since there it can effectively be reduced to a one-channel case, with just\ntwo Riemann sheets. In the present paper, we shall study isoscalar S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering near\nthreshold, thereby ignoring the small mass difference between neutral and charged pion pairs.\nThe basic ingredients of the RSE are confinement and quark-pair creation. In its lowest-order\napproximation, a permanently confined quark-antiquark system is assumed, having a spectrum\nwith an infinite number of bound states, related to the details of the confining force. We shall\ndenote the energy levels of this confinement spectrum by En (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Here , we assume\nthat the confinement spectrum is given by\nEn = E0 + 2n\u03c9 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich choice is anyhow rather immaterial for the purpose of our present study. The parameter\nE0 represents, to lowest order, the ground-state mass of the quark-antiquark system, which is\nrelated to the effective flavour masses of the system. The strength of the confinement force is\nparametrised by \u03c9 and gauged by the level splittings of the system. In experiment one cannot\ndirectly measure the quantities E0 and \u03c9, because of the large higher-order contributions. Consequently, the lowest-order system is purely hypothetical. Nevertheless, one can obtain some\norder-of-magnitude insight by examining mesonic spectra with more than one experimentally\nknown recurrency.\nFrom the J P C = 1\u2212\u2212 charmonium and bottomonium states, one may conclude that the\naverage level splitting is of the order of 380 MeV, leading to \u03c9 = 0.19 MeV, independent of\nflavour. The latter property is compatible with the flavour blindness of QCD, confirmed by\nexperiment [2]. Indeed, the level splittings of the positive-parity f2 mesons seem to confirm\nthat flavour independence can be extended to light quarks [3]. From the ground states of the\nrecurrencies one may then extract the order of magnitude of the effective quark masses, e.g.\n2mc = m(J/\u03c8) = 3.1 GeV (in the RSE [4] we find for twice the effective charm mass the\nvalue 3.124 GeV), or 2mu/d = m(\u03c1) = 0.77 GeV (0.812 GeV in the RSE). For the choice (1) of\nconfinement force, we determine E0 = mq + mq\u0304 + (1.5 + l)\u03c9. Once the effective flavour masses\nand \u03c9 are fixed [4], we may describe other systems, like scalar mesons and mixed flavours [5\u20139].\nThrough quark-pair creation the q q\u0304 system is coupled to those two-meson systems which are\nallowed by quantum numbers. In principle, many different two-meson channels can couple to\none specific quark-antiquark system. Here, since we study the properties of the channel lowest\nin mass, we will strip the RSE of all other possible two-meson channels, thereby assuming that\ntheir influence far below their respective thresholds will be negligible. Via consecutive quark-pair\ncreation and annihilation, a q q\u0304 pair may also couple to pairs of different flavour, for instance\nu\u016b(dd\u0304) \u2194 ss\u0304. Here, as we study pion-pion scattering near threshold, we shall assume that the\ncoupling of a light pair of flavours to strange-antistrange can be ignored.\nThe intensity of quark-pair creation is in the RSE parametrised by the flavour-independent\nparameter \u03bb. In principle, it has to be adjusted to the data. However, one may get an idea of the\nright order of magnitude by the following reasoning. For small values of \u03bb, one may determine\nthe width of the ground-state resonance in the one-channel case (pion-pion here) by [10]\nsin\n2\n\n\u0393 \u2248 \u03bb E0\n\n2\n\na\nE02 \u2212 4m2\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0012 q\n\naq 2\nE0 \u2212 4m2\u03c0\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere a represents the average distance at which light quark pairs are created, and which can\nalso be defined in a flavour-independent fashion [11]. For light quarks, a is about 0.6 fm, as we\nwill see later on. If we take, for example, the f0 (1370) resonance width of 0.2\u20130.5 GeV, then we\nobtain \u03bb \u2248 0.60\u20130.95. This is of the order of 1, which would not allow the approximation (2).\nNevertheless, we actually employ here a value for \u03bb which is of the same order of magnitude as\nour estimate (see caption of Fig. 1).\n\n2\n\nThe RSE amplitude for the I = 0 \u03c0\u03c0 isoscalar S-wave\n\nThe RSE amplitude suitable for our purposes results from the ladder sum in quark-pair creation\n[1], and has for I = 0 S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering the form\n2\n\na\u03bb E\u03bc\nE 0\n=\nT (E) =\n2k 0\n\nt00 (E)\n\n\u221e (n + 1) 4\u2212n\nsin2 (ka) X\n\n(ka)2\n\nn=0\n\nEn \u2212 E\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\u221e (n + 1) 4\u2212n\nsin(ka) ika X\n2\n1 \u2212 2\u03bb \u03bc\ne\nka\nEn \u2212 E\nn=0\n\nwhere En is defined in Eq.

The main\nreason is the absence of a coupling to ss\u0304 in the q q\u0304 sector, as well as the KK\u0304 channel (see e.g.\nRef. [16]). However, for energies below 400 MeV the agreement with the data is excellent. Even\nbelow threshold, at about 280 MeV, the hypothetical data of Ref. [13] are fairly well reproduced.\nIn fact, the RSE only deviates because it does not exactly reproduce the so-called Adler zero [17]\nfor non-vanishing total invariant mass E. This does not mean that above threshold, where the\nRSE scattering amplitude does agree with the true data, the real part of t00 cannot be proportional\nto something of a form similar to Weinberg's expression (5). It only means that below threshold\nthe analytic form of Re (t00 ) = t00 may be slightly different from what is predicted in Refs. [14,17],\nfor very small, unphysical values of E.\nIn order to study this in more detail, we expand formula (3) near threshold (E > 2m\u03c0 ):\n\u0010\n\nRe t00 (E)\n\n\u00d7\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2248\n\na\n4m\u03c0\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE 2 + 4m2\u03c0 \u0010\n\n1 \u2212 13 a2 m2\u03c0 S1 + S2 \u2212 23 S12 \u2212 S1 S2 +\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 23 a2 m2\u03c0 S13\n\n(1 \u2212 S1 )3\n1 2 2\na m\u03c0 S1\n3\n\n1\u2212\n\n1 2 2\na m\u03c0\n3\n\n\u2212 S2 \u2212 21 S12 + S1 S2 +\n\n\u0011\n\nS1 + S2 \u2212\n\n3 2\nS\n2 1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ 32 a2 m2\u03c0 S13\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 S1 S2 +\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere we have defined\nS\u03b1 = \u03bb 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nm\u03b1\u03c0 (n + 1) 4\u2212n\n(E0 + 2n\u03c9 \u2212 2m\u03c0 )\n\n\u03b1\n\n(\u03b1 = 1, 2) .\n\n2 2 2\na m\u03c0\n3\n\n\u0011\n\n\u00d7\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n\uf8f4\nS13 \uf8fe\n\n(8)\n\nInsertion of the model parameters (see caption of Fig. 1) yields\n\u0010\n\nRe t00 (E)\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2248\n\nE 2 \u2212 0.90 m2\u03c0\n16\u03c0 (75.2 MeV)2\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nConsequently, we find that the apparent \"Adler zero\" in the RSE, as seen from above threshold, is\nalmost twice the value that follows from Eq. 5. Anyhow, the behaviour of Re (t00 ) below threshold\ncannot not be a simple continuation of the form above threshold, since the derivative of Re (t00 ) at\nthreshold is discontinuous, as is shown in Fig. 2. The crucial point is that one cannot analytically\ncontinue the real part of the amplitude, for the trivial reason that the real part of an analytic\nfunction is not analytic. Hence, where t00 \u2261 Re (t00 ) (for E < 2m\u03c0 ) precisely has its zero is rather\nirrelevant for the behaviour of Re (t00 ) for E > 2m\u03c0 .

Threshold is at 279.14 MeV for charged pion pairs.\n\nrelations of Ref. [13] yield a zero at (0.41 \u00b1 0.06) m2\u03c0 for the amplitude. However, when the real\npart of the same amplitude is extrapolated from above threshold to below threshold, according\nto an approximation of the form (9), then one finds a zero at (0.80 \u00b1 0.10) m2\u03c0 .\nAlternatively, we may consider the modulus of the amplitude (3), for which the derivative at\nthreshold is continuous, and which behaves near threshold according to\nt00 (E) \u2248\n\nE 2 \u2212 0.95 m2\u03c0\n16\u03c0 (74.6 MeV)\n\n(E > 2m\u03c0 ).\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\nThis is probably where Hanhart in Ref.

We observe here that the higher-order\ncorrections are substantial, by comparing the values obtained from the threshold behaviour in\nthe RSE for the amplitude's Born term (Eq. 12) and for the full amplitude, either for its real\npart (Eq. 9), or alternatively for its modulus (Eq. 10).\n5\n\n\f3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe predictive power of the RSE as an analytic method to unquench the quark model has been\ndemonstrated before, by interrelating an enormous variety of non-exotic mesonic systems, such as\nthe light scalar mesons f0 (600), f0 (980), K0\u2217 (800), a0 (980) and the corresponding S-wave \u03c0\u03c0, K\u03c0,\n\u03b7\u03c0 scattering observables [5,16], the scalars between 1.3 and 1.5 GeV [5], vector and pseudoscalar\n\u2217\n\u2217\nmesons [4], charmonium and bottomonium [11], the Ds0\n(2317) [6], and the DsJ\n(2860) [9]. In the\npresent Letter, we have shown that also at the \u03c0\u03c0 threshold the RSE behaves as expected from\nmore general considerations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia of the Minist\u00e9rio\nda Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior of Portugal, under contract PDCT/FP/63907/2005.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. van Beveren and G.
