It is shown that in both (Z and Atoll) NS and BHC systems radio emission,\nand therefore jet formation, is correlated with the presence of hard (30\u2013500 keV) X-ray\nemission. At \u03b3-ray (> 500 keV) energies, the relation is not so clear. Possible physical\nconnections between the presence of a jet, with a population of relativistic electrons,\nand the emission of hard X-rays, are briefly discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION \u2013 JETS FROM X-RAY BINARIES\nThe study of 'microquasars', or the phenomenon of relativistic jets from X-ray\nbinary systems, is one of the most vigorously pursued fields in observational highenergy astrophysics in recent years. Once Mirabel & Rodriguez (1994) had shown\nthat X-ray binary systems were capable of producing relativistic (bulk Lorentz\nfactor \u0393 \u2265 2) outflows, whose primary signature was in the radio band, it was\nrecognised that such 'jets' may constitute an important aspect of the 'accretion'\nprocess onto compact objects. In recent years observations have clearly demonstrated the presence of jets in most classes of X-ray binary, and furthermore have\nclearly indicated a strong coupling with the accretion 'state' of the source, whether\nneutron star (e.g. Penninx et al. 1988) or black hole accretor (e.g. Fender et al.\n1999b). See e.g. Hjellming & Han (1995), Mirabel & Rodriguez (1999), and other\npapers by this author for reviews of radio emission and jets from X-ray binaries\n(although note that new observations are coming thick and fast all the time!). See\ne.g. Lewin, van Paradijs & van den Heuvel (1995) for an excellent volume containing reviews of the models for the different 'states' of accreting neutron stars and\nblack holes (admittedly from the era before the ubiquity and significance of jets\nwas widely recognised).\nIn Fig 1 and 2 I summarise the current understanding of the empirical relation\nof radio emission to X-ray 'state' of the neutron star (NS) and black hole candidate\n(BHC) systems respectively. In addition to the relations indicated in these figures,\nit seems that discrete, radio-emitting ejection events (in which the radio spectrum\n\n\f'Atoll' sources\n\n8\n\nB (surface) ~ 10\nG?\nm ~ 0.01-0.1 Edd\n\n'hard' colour\n\nX-ray col-col diag.\nUB\nm\n\nRadio\non (?)\n\nIS\nLB\n\n'Z' sources\n\n10\n\nB (surface) ~ 10\nm ~ 0.5-1.0 Edd\n\nG?\n\n'hard' colour\n\n'soft' colour\nHB\n\nRadio\non\n\nNB\nFB\nm\n\n'soft' colour\n\nX-ray pulsars\n\n12\n\nB (surface) > 10\nG\nm ~ 0.01-1.0 Edd\ndisc truncated > 1000 km\nNO radio emission\n\nSco X-1\n\nFIGURE 1. Top panel: a qualititative sketch of the relation of jets to accretion in the three\n'types' of neutron star XRB. In the low-field 'Atoll' sources the accretion rate is believed to be\n< 10% Eddington, except possibly during rare transient outbursts (e.g. Aql X-1); the evidence is\nmarginal so far but it appears such sources are 'radio on' when in the 'Island State' (IS) in the\nX-ray colour-colour diagram (CD). The Z sources are believed to be accreting at a much higher\nrate, near Eddington, and are 'radio on' when on the 'Horizontal Branch' and maybe also, at a\nlower level, the 'Normal Branch' in the CD. Note that for both Atoll and Z sources the estimates\nof surface magnetic field are very uncertain. Finally, in the high-field X-ray pulsars no radio\nsynchrotron emission has ever been detected; possibly this is due to truncation of the accretion\ndisc a long way from the neutron star. Lower panel: the jets of the Z source Sco X-1, directly\nresolved with the VLBA (Bradshaw, Fomalont & Geldzahler 1999).\n\n\frapidly becomes optically thin) are associated with state transitions (including\noutbursts of transients \u2013 Fig 3).\nWhile some areas of the coupling between accretion flow and jet are still empirically uncertain (the Atoll sources, the Intermediate/Very High state for BHCs), it\nseems that all XRBs except the high-field X-ray pulsars will, under the right conditions, produce a synchrotron-emitting jet. It is therefore an important question to\naddress the significance of this jet, energetically and dynamically, for the process\nof accretion onto compact objects as a whole. One thing obvious from inspection\nof Figs 1(a),(b) is the apparent anti-correlation between the mass accretion rate,\n\u1e41, traditionally estimated from X-ray studies alone, and the presence of a jet, in\nboth NS and BHC systems (see also Belloni, Migliari & Fender 2000 and Homan\net al. 2001 for further discussion). The energetics of jets from X-ray binaries in\ngeneral, and BHCs in the Low/Hard state in particular, are discussed in detail in\nFender (2001a,b), in which it is concluded that the jets probably contain at least\n20% of the liberated accretion energy, maybe much more.\n\nHARD X-RAYS : \u223c30\u2013500 KEV\nIn this energy band (rather arbitrarily defined here) there are several detections\nof X-ray binary systems.\n\nNeutron stars\nBoth of the two major groups of neutron star systems which probably produce\njets, Z and Atoll sources, have been detected in some cases to energies \u2265 30 keV.\nIn the case of the Z sources, a picture now seems to be emerging whereby a hard\ntail, extending to \u2265 100 keV, is present in varying degree, being strongest on the\nHorizontal Branch (HB) of the X-ray colour diagram (CD) and weakest (or nonexistent) on the Flaring Branch (FB; see Fig 1 for a schematic of a 'typical' CD).\nAsai et al. (1994) first found evidence for a hard tail from GX 5-1 which decreased\nfrom the Normal Branch (NB) to the FB. More recently Di Salvo et al. (2001\na,b) have reported the detection of a hard X-ray tail from the Z sources GX 17+2\nand GX 349+2; again the data seem to be consistent with the hard X-ray tail\nbeing strongest in the HB/NB and weakest on the FB. Iaria et al. (2001) also\nfind evidence for a hard tail in the jet source Cir X-1, which may be an unusual Z\nsource. Hard X-ray emission has also been reported from the archetypal Z source\nSco X-1, although its correspondence with position on the Z is unclear (D'Amico\net al. 2001). Strickman & Barret (2000) report that the hard X-ray emission in\nSco X-1 may be correlated with periods of radio flaring. Comparison of this picture\nwith Fig 1 shows that observationally, the presence of the hard tail seems to be\ncorrelated with the presence of radio emission (and therefore almost certainly jet\nproduction). Note that in the received wisdom \u1e41 increases from HB\u2192NB\u2192FB,\nand so both jet and hard X-ray production are anticorrelated with \u1e41.\n\n\fPower spectra\n\n.\nm ??\n\nEnergy spectra\n\nrms < 5%\n\nkT ~ 1keV\n\nRadio reduced\nby more than 30\ntimes compared\nto Low state\n\nHigh/Soft\n\nindex\n~2.5\n\nState\n\nIntermediate /\n\n1-10Hz\nrms 5-10%\n\nrms 20-50%\n<1 Hz\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n?\n\nVery high state\n\nkT < 1keV\nindex ~1.5\n\nLow/Hard\n(+Off) state\n\nSteady\nSelfabsorbed\njet\n\n|\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nRadio properties\n\nX-ray properties\n\n25\n\nCyg X-1\n\n20\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n-6\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\nFIGURE 2.

Left panel: optically thin radio events associated with outbursts seem to arise in\ndiscrete ejections of material during the rapid state change. In the case of black hole systems if\nthe source transits to the High/Soft X-ray state [stage 3(a)] the radio emission remains optically\nthin and fades away; if the system instead transits to the Low/Hard X-ray state [stage 3(b)] then a\nflat spectral component, probably the signature of a powerful partially self-absorbed jet, emerges\n(see Fig 2). Something like the sequence 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3(a) may also occur in the NS (atoll-like)\ntransients.

A hard X-ray tail from the Z source GX 17+2 (di Salvo et al. 2000b); the left panel\ncorresponds to the upper Horizontal Branch (HB), the right panel to the lower Normal Branch\n(NB; see Fig 1 for a sketch of the 'Z' indicating HB, NB and 'Flaring Branch' FB). It is clear\nthat the hard (> 30 keV) X-ray excess is present only in the left spectrum; note further that the\nHorizontal Branch the state corresponding to most radio emission from Z sources (see Fig 1).\n\nThe Atoll sources, weaker as a population than the Z sources at radio wavelengths\n(Fender & Hendry 2000), also display hard X-ray states with emission detected up\nto and beyond 100 keV. For example, di Salvo et al. (2000) report the detection to\nsuch high energies of the atoll source 4U 1728-34, and Barret et al. (2000) report\nhard X-ray tails from four other Atoll-type X-ray binaries. It is clear that in 'low'\nstates of the Atoll sources a hard X-ray power-law is present which seems to be\nthe dominant component in the broadband spectral energy distribution. If, as we\nsuspect, both by analogy with BHCs and recent observations, (work in preparation), that radio emission in Atoll sources is also associated with 'low' X-ray states,\nspecifically the Island State (IS) in the Atoll CD, we again find, as with the Z\nsources, that radio and hard X-ray emission are correlated with each other and\nanti-correlated with apparent \u1e41.\n\nBlack Holes\nMany BHC systems have been detected at energies above 30 keV; in fact the\nX-ray power-law which dominates the high-energy radiation from BHCs in the\nLow/Hard spectral state generally extends to at least 100 keV.

Fig 2 illustrates the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the main 'states'\nschematically, and Fig 5 shows some examples of 'real' X-ray spectra. Hard X-ray\nemission seems to be a general, although not exclusive, property of BHCs.\nThe BATSE and OSSE instruments onboard the (late) CGRO mission contributed an exceptional amount to our understanding of the relation of the hard\nX-ray emission from BHCs (e.g. Grove et al. 1997, 1998). Brocksopp et al. (1999)\nand Corbel et al. (2000) showed that there is a strong correlation between hard\nX-rays (as measued with BATSE) and radio emission in the persistent BHCs Cyg\nX-1 and GX 339-4 (Fig 6). McCollough et al. (1999) showed that the jet source\nCyg X-3 (which may be a BHC) shows both correlated and anti-correlated radio\n\u2013 hard X-ray behaviour (Fig 7); this may correspond to different X-ray 'states'\nand/or rapid state transitions in this source (whose accretion properties remain\nshrouded by a dense wind). The BHC GRS 1915+105 (see right panel of Fig 2)\nis probably the best-known 'microquasar' and is a strong source of hard X-rays,\nbeing well-detected by BATSE over a six-year period. Foster et al. (1996) reported\nhard X-ray states, or 'plateaux' in this source. These plateaux seem to be periods\nof steady jet production, like luminous variants on the 'canonical' Low/Hard X-ray\nstate, and are generally followed by discrete, relativistic ejection events (Fender\net al. 1999a; Dhawan et al. 2000). The GRANAT mission has also contributed\nimmensely to our understanding of patterns of hard X-ray emission from X-ray\n\n\fFIGURE 6.

Many other examples of\nhard X-ray detections of BHCs exist in the literature, but it seems that the majority of detections are associated with the Low/Hard X-ray state and/or transient\noutbursts, both of which are associated with jet production (Figs 2 & 3).\nGrove et al. (1998) clearly establish that while the hard (photon index \u223c 1.5)\nX-ray power laws observed in the Low/Hard state tend to break at about 100 keV,\nwhen the spectrum is dominated by a soft (presumably disc) component the steep\n(photon index \u223c 2.5) power-law tail observed does not show a break to at least\nseveral hundred keV. This weak, high energy tail in the soft state (when the jet is\napparently off - Fig 2) probably requires a nonthermal population of Comptonising\nelectrons (Poutanen 1998).\n\n\u03b3-RAYS : > 500 KEV\nAbove \u223c 500keV the number of detections of X-ray binaries drops significantly.\nCyg X-1, the classic BHC, was repeatedly detected at \u2265 1 MeV with COMPTEL\non CGRO, and may even be stronger above 1 MeV in the 'High/Soft' state (Fig\n8; McConnell et al. 2001 a,b). The relativistic jet source GRO J1655-40 and the\nLow/Hard state source GRO J0422+32 are also both detected up to \u223c 1 MeV\n(Grove et al. 1998). More dramatically, Goldwurm et al. (1992) reported the\ndetection of a positron annihilation line from GRO J0422+32, although this may\nin fact be associated with Lithium (e.g. Martin et al. 1994).\nAt even higher energies, Paredes et al.

During 'quiescent' periods (e.g. JD 2448500-8550) hard X-rays and radio are\nanti-correlated.

They suggest that the \u03b3-rays are produced by inverse Compton upscattering of lower-energy photons by the nonthermal\nrelativistic electron population producing the resolved radio emission. It is worth\nnoting that LSI+61\u25e6 303 is also an X-ray-faint, radio-bright system which may be\nassociated with an EGRET source (Harrison et al. 2000 and references therein).\n\nDISCUSSION\nThere seems to be a qualitative empirical relation between the presence of hard\n(rather arbitrarily defined as 30\u2013500 keV) X-ray emission and radio emission in\nboth NS and BHC X-ray binaries. Since the evidence strongly points to the radio\nemission arising in a synchrotron-emitting jet, this implies an association between\nthe presence of a hard X-ray emission and the production of an outflowing, nothermal, population of relativistic electrons. Are these two things related causally,\nor are they simply both more or less independent manifestations of a particular\naccretion/outflow 'state' ?\nSince (a) the hard X-ray emission is generally taken to arise in (inverse) Comptonisation of soft photons by energetic electrons (Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980; Poutanen\n1998 and references therein), (b) the synchrotron emission from the jet directly in-\n\n\f-2\n\nLow X-Ray State\nCOMPTEL\nOSSE\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nFlux * E (MeV cm sec MeV )\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nHigh X-Ray State (VP 522.5)\nCOMPTEL\nOSSE\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nEnergy (MeV)\nFIGURE 8.

(1999b) it was\nsuggested that the 'base' of the jet is responsible for the Comptonisation in the\ncanonical Low/Hard X-ray state. However, the favoured models for the Low/Hard\nstate invoke thermal Comptonisation (Poutanen 1998 and references therein).\nAre the jets significant enough energetically to contribute in hard X-rays, or\nis the power-law distribution responsible for the synchrotron emission simply a\nsmall high-energy tail of a much more energetically significant thermal distribuion\n? Without accurately normalised estimates of both populations for one source, it is\nhard to make a comparison. However, Fender (2000a,b) argues that the jets from\nBHCs in the Low/Hard state are likely to be a significant power output channel\nfor the accretion energy. If the synchrotron spectrum extends merely to the nearinfrared band (\u223c 2\u03bcm) and the jet has a radiative efficiency of \u2264 0.05 then the jet is\nlikely to contribute \u2265 20% of the bolometric luminosity of the system in this state.\nIt seems therefore that in the Low/Hard state at least there is enough power in the\njet to justify consideration of its contribution to the hard X-ray/\u03b3-ray emission a\nsource.\nAharonian & Atoyan (1998) and Atoyan & Aharonian (1999) discuss the possibility of \u03b3-rays from the jets of GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105 and SS 433. In\nparticular, Atoyan & Aharonian (1999) predict that inverse Compton emission (or\nmaybe even direct synchrotron emission) directly from the jets in GRS 1915+105\ncould dominate the high-energy emission above an MeV or so. More radically,\nMarkoff, Falcke & Fender (2000) suggest that in the Low/Hard X-ray state the\nbroadband radio through X-ray spectrum is dominated by the jet (with some con-\n\n\f6\n\n4\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-2\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\nFIGURE 9.

In this model\nthe X-ray power-law is dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission from the\npost-shock region near the base of the jet.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo conclude, it seems that, while some famous and poorly-explained exceptions\nexist in the literature (e.g. GRO J1655-40; Tavani et al. 1996), in general the presence of 'hard' X-ray emission (30\u2013500 keV) is correlated with the presence of radio\nemission in both NS and BHC X-ray binaries (with the exception of high-field X-ray\npulsars which do not seem to produce jets \u2013 Fender & Hendry 2000). In some cases\n(e.g. GX 339-4; Fig 6) this correlation is very tight. Adopting the classical picture\nof hard X-ray production via Comptonisation, this broad correlation implies the\nsimultaneous presence of a Comptonising corona and synchrotron-emitting (and\ntherefore relativistic) jet in 'hard' accretion 'states'. This may suggest that the\n'base' of the jet, within a few hundred Schwarzschild radii of the compact object, is\nproviding the hot electrons for the Comptonisation process (Fender et al. 1999b),\nalthough models for Comptonisation in the Low/Hard state of BHCs favour a thermal population of electrons in the corona (Poutanen 1998 and references therein).\nMore radically, the signature of the jet may extend to much higher energies than\nthe radio regime, and may even challenge the Comptonisation model of hard X-ray\n\n\fproduction (Markoff et al. 2000).\nThe relation of jets to the presence of \u03b3-ray (> 500 keV) emission is less clear, and\nfurther systematic studies (with e.g. INTEGRAL) are required. However, given\nthat radio jets, with their population of very high energy electrons, are natural\nsites for the production of high energy photons via both inverse Compton scattering\n(Atoyan & Aharonian 1999; Paredes et al. 2000) and maybe even direct synchrotron\nemission (Markoff et al. 2000) such connections should be investigated in detail in\nthe future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI would like to thank Tiziana di Salvo, Didier Barret and Felix Aharonian for\nreading through draft versions of this work.\n\nREFERENCES\nAharonian F.A., Atoyan A.M., 1998, New Astr.
