We use Buckingham's \u03a0 theorem of dimensional analysis to obtain a\nfamily of dimensional relations among the physical quantities associated with the jets.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough the first report of an astrophysical jet\nwas made by Curtis [2], these objects were extensively studied much later with radio astronomy techniques [3]. Quasars, and radiogalaxies were discovered and later gathered in a unified model which proposed a dusty torus around the nucleus of the source\n[4]. Years later, some galactic sources showed similar\nfeatures to the ones presented by quasars and radiogalaxies, i.e. relativistic fluxes, a central engine, symmetrical collimated jets, radiating lobes, and apparent\nsuperluminal motions [5]. Optical and X-ray observations showed other similar non\u2013relativistic sources in\nthe galaxy associated to H-H objects [6]. Lately the\nstrong explosions found in long Gamma Ray Bursts,\nhad been modelled as collapsars, in which a jet is associated to the observed phenomena, in order to explain\nthe observations [7, 8].\nThe similarities between all astrophysical jets,\nmainly those between quasars and micro\u2013quasars, and\nthe scaling laws for black holes proposed by Sams et al.\n[1] and Rees [11] made us search for the possible existence of some hydrodynamical scaling laws for astrophysical jets.\nThe present work presents a few mathematical relations that naturally appear as a consequence of dimensional analysis and Buckingham's \u03a0 theorem. We\nbegin by considering some of the most natural physical dimensional quantities that have to be included\nin order to describe some of the physical phenomena\nrelated to all classes of jets. With this and the use\nof dimensional analysis we then calculate the dimensional relations associated to these quantities. Finally,\nwe briefly discuss these relations and their physical\nrelevance to astrophysical jets.\n\nII.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nA complete description for the formation of an astrophysical jet is certainly complicated. However,\nthere are some essential physical ingredients that must\nenter into the description of the problem. To begin\nwith, the mass M of the central object must accrete\nInsert PSN Here\n\nFIG. 1: Astrophysical jets are very common and exist in\nmany different sizes. On the left, extending \u223c 105 pc, FR I\nand FR 2 sources are shown. The upper right panel shows\nthe micro\u2013quasar SS 433. It presents relativistic fluxes\nand apparent superluminal motions analogous to those in\nquasars. The lower right panel shows jets associated to\nHerbig\u2013Haro objects with lengths \u223c 10\u22121 \u2212 10 pc. All jets\nhave a condensed (sometimes compact) object accreting\nmatter from their surroundings. There is also an accretion\ndisc around the central condensed object and a pair of\nsymmetrical collimated jets that end up in radiating lobes.\nThe images were taken from Bridle [9], Paragi et al. [10]\nand and hubblesite.org.\n\nmaterial from its surroundings at an accretion rate\n\u1e40 . Now, because gravity and magnetic fields B are\nnecessary in order to generate jets, Newton's constant\nof gravity G and the velocity of light c must be taken\ninto account. If in addition there is some characteristic length l (e.g. the jet's length), a characteristic density \u03c1 (e.g. the density of the surrounding medium)\nand a characteristic velocity v (e.g. the jet's ejection\nvelocity), then the jet's luminosity (or power) L is a\nfunction related to all these quantities in the following\nmanner\n\nL = L(\u1e40 , M, c, G, B, l, v, \u03c1).\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nXXII Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics\nUsing Buckingham's \u03a0 theorem of dimensional analysis [12, 13] the following non\u2013trivial dimensionless\nparameters are found\nG\u1e40\nL\nBc1/2 M\n, \u03a02 = 3 , \u03a03 =\n,\nc\n\u1e40 c2\n\u1e40 3/2\n\u03c1 c3 M 2\nl\u1e40\n.\n, \u03a05 =\n\u03a04 =\nMc\n\u1e40 3\n\n\u03a01 =\n\nrj \u221d\n(2)\n\nFrom the parameter \u03a02 it follows that\n\n\u03a02 =\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\nc2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u1e40\nM\n\n!\n\nrj \u2248 100\n\nM\n,\n\u1e40\n\n(3)\n\ndefines a characteristic time in which the central object doubles its mass, then using equation (3) we can\nwrite \u03a02 as\n\u03a02 =\n\nM 1/3 c2/3\n\u2248 102\nB 2/3\n\nrs\n,\n2\u03c4 c\n\n\u03bb \u223c c\u03c4,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich can be thought of as the maximum possible\nlength a jet could have, since \u03c4 is roughly an upper\nlimit to the lifetime of the source.\nIn what follows we will use the following typical\nvalues\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u00131/3 \u0012\n\nB\n1G\n\n\u0013\u22122/3\n\npc.

This is probably due to the following. For a fixed value of the mass of the central object\n(in any case, for the time that accretion takes place,\nthe mass of the central object does not increase too\n\nmuch) when the accretion mass rate increases, then\nthe magnetic field lines anchored to the plasma tend\nto pack up, meaning that the field intensity increases\nin such a way as to get the correct result given by\nequation (14).\n\nIV.\n\nWe would like to thank S.
