While the freezing of d-density wave fluctuations is one proposal for the origin of the SG in doped\ncuprates, there also exist other interpretations.5\u20137,15\u201318\nFor example, it has been argued that the glassiness found\nin doped Mott insulators may be self-generated, due to\nthe competition between interactions on different length\nscales, and that quenched disorder may merely further\nstabilize SG order.17 The most discussed scenario has\nbeen the so-called cluster SG,5,6 with holes on the cluster\nboundaries and in the clusters giving rise to SG physics\nand to the experimentally observed incommensurate spin\ncorrelations.7\nGiven the enormous interest in the connection between magnetic correlations and HTS, it would be valuable to investigate the detailed magnetic properties of related, nonmetallic materials such as La2 Cu1\u2212x Lix O4 (LiLCO).19\u201323 Since Li+ not only provides one hole carrier,\nbut also removes a Cu2+ spin, this system experiences\nthe dual effects of spin dilution and frustration. Unlike Sr-LCO, Li-LCO does not superconduct19 and shows\nno evidence of incommensurate AF correlations.23 However, early work on polycrystalline samples reported a\nrapid suppression of AF order with doping,20\u201322 similar\nto Sr doping rather than Zn doping, and evidence for\nspin freezing in the N\u00e9el state.22 The remarkable similarity of magnetic properties of lightly doped Li-LCO with\nthose of Sr-LCO has been interpreted as due to new collective behavior of the holes.22 Therefore, in connection\nwith HTS, the detailed magnetic properties and phase\ndiagram of Li-LCO are of considerable interest. Experimentally, spin freezing is observed at a different temperature, depending on the time scale of the probe.7,24 Unlike NQR,3,22 \u03bcSR,9,10 and neutron scattering,4,7 magnetometry using a superconducing quantum interference\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nDepending on the nature and concentration of dopants,\nLa2 CuO4 (LCO) displays a wide variety of phenomena\nsuch as antiferromagnetism, spin glass (SG) behavior, an\nanomalous metallic response, and high-temperature superconductivity (HTS). Undoped LCO contains weakly\ncoupled CuO2 planes and exhibits antiferromagnetic\n(AF) order of the Cu2+ spin-1/2 moments below TN \u2248\n325 K. Replacement of Cu2+ by nonmagnetic Zn2+ or\nMg2+ models random spin dilution, leading the system\ninto a disordered state at doping concentrations above\n\u223c 40%.1 On the other hand, substitution of divalent alkaline earth cations for La3+ or the introduction of excess\ninterstitial oxygen introduces hole charge carriers into the\nCuO2 planes which frustrate the spin system.2 A concentration of x = 0.02 in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (Sr-LCO) is\nenough to destroy the AF order; this value is one order of magnitude smaller than for the spin-dilution case.\nSpin freezing has been found at low temperatures in the\nAF doping regime (x < 0.02),3 with recent direct evidence for electronic phase separation.4 Further doping\n(x > 0.02) leads to the emergence of a SG phase,5\u20137 followed by superconductivity for x \u2248 0.06 \u2212 0.25. SG order\nis found to coexist with superconductivity,8 with no apparent anomaly in the SG temperature at the doping level\nx \u223c 0.06 at which superconductivity first occurs.8\u201310 The\nphase diagram of the substitutionally-doped bilayer material Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6 (Ca-YBCO) closely resembles\nthat of Sr-LCO,9 and spin freezing has also been found in\nLCO (Ref. 11) and YBCO (Ref. 12) doped with excess\noxygen.\nThe extrapolated disappearance of SG order in SrLCO and Ca-YBCO appears to coincide with the doping level at which the normal state pseudogap extrapolates to zero, and it has been suggested that this\nmight be consistent with predictions involving quantum\ncriticality.10,13,14 In the d-density wave picture of HTS,13\n\n1\n\n\fdevice (SQUID) is essentially a static probe, allowing a\nmore accurate extraction of the SG transition temperature Tsg .6,7 Our results for lightly-doped samples demonstrate the feasibility of using bulk magnetometry to extract spin freezing temperatures in the N\u00e9el regime. The\npresent magnetometry study establishes the existence of\na nearly quantitative agreement of the bulk magnetic\nphase diagram of Li-LCO with that of Sr-LCO. Since the\nstrength and type of the disorder as well as the charge\ntransport differ significantly in these two materials, this\nfinding places constraints on the origin of the SG degrees\nof freedom in hole-doped cuprates.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the temperature and doping dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of\nLa2 Cu1\u2212x Lix O4 , taken with a field of H = 0.1 kOe along\nthe tetragonal a-axis. The data exhibit several features\nwhich systematically shift with doping up to x = 0.03,\nand change their nature above this doping level. Earlier\npowder studies had demonstrated a rapid suppression of\nthe AF order with Li doping,20\u201322 and the Li concentration at which N\u00e9el order is lost corresponds to x \u223c 0.03.\nThe doping dependence of the N\u00e9el temperature determined by local20,22 and bulk21 magnetic probes agree\nquite well, and until now this has been the only magnetic phase boundary known in the Li system. However,\nthe present results indicate that the phase diagram in LiLCO is more complicated than what has been determined\nfrom powder samples.\n\u03bcSR results indicate magnetic order at low temperatures even up to x \u223c 0.10,20 but bulk magnetization\nmeasurements in powder samples only show spin paramagnetism for x > 0.03.21 The temperature dependent\nsusceptibility for x > 0.03 can therefore be expressed by\nthe extended Curie-Weiss formula:\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\n\nUsing the traveling-solvent floating-zone method,25\nwe have succeeded in growing large single crystals of\nLa2 Cu1\u2212x Lix O4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.07). The crystal axes were\nprecisely determined by the x-ray Laue backscattering\ntechnique. In order to eliminate possible hole doping by\nexcess oxygen, the crystals were carefully heat treated\nunder reducing conditions. The Li concentrations were\nestimated to within \u00b10.003 from x-ray diffraction measurements of the lattice constants.21 For a few samples,\nwe confirmed this estimate using neutron diffraction to\ndetermine structural and N\u00e9el transition temperatures.21\nAll magnetometry data reported here were taken with\na commercial SQUID magnetometer with the magnetic\nfield along the tetragonal a-axis.\n\n30\n\n\u03c7(T ) = \u03c70 +\n\nx =0.07\n0.05\n\n10\n\nM / H ( 10-6emu / g )\n\n-7\n\nM / H ( 10 emu / g )\n\n0.06\n\n0\nH = 0.1 kOe // a-axis\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n\n4\n\n1.5\n\nLa2Cu1-xLixO4\n\n1.25\n\n( x = 0.05 )\n\n0.1 kOe\n1 kOe\n\n1\n\n1\n0.75\n10 kOe\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c70 , C, and \u0398 are the T -independent susceptibility, Curie constant, and Curie-Weiss temperature, respectively.

We note that\nthese parameters are roughly comparable with those SrLCO: \u03c70 = 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 emu/g for x = 0.04,6 C = 2\u22125 \u00d7\n10\u22126 emu K/g, and \u0398 = 0 K for x = 0.03\u22120.05.6,7\n\nLa2Cu1-xLixO4 single crystals\n\n20\n\nC\n,\n(T \u2212 \u0398 )\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nH = 0.1 kOe // a-axis\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nT(K)\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nT(K)\n\n300\n\nFIG. 2.

As described in detail below by the appropriate limits of the\nscaling function, the SG order parameter in the zero-field\nlimit increases from zero upon cooling below Tsg , which\nlead to a decrease of \u03c7(T ) for T < Tsg . Furthermore, the\nresulting peak becomes broader as the applied magnetic\nfield is increased due to the enhancement of the order\nparameter both above and below Tsg . This behavior is\ndemonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2. From the peak in the\nlowest field (H = 0.1 kOe) we determined Tsg = 6.2(1) K,\nwhich should be compared to Tsg = 5.0(5) K for Sr-LCO\nwith x = 0.05.7 Hysteresis below Tsg , observed between\nzero-field-cooled and field-cooled curves, is indicated with\nthe help of arrows in the inset of Fig. 2. Such a behavior\nis also characteristic of a SG. Observing these features\nin either small crystals or polycrystalline samples would\nbe difficult because they become obscured as the field is\nincreased, or when the field direction is canted away from\nthe CuO2 plane.\nThe large oriented single crystals used in the present\nstudy have enabled us to further characterize the SG\nstate by means of a critical scaling analysis of the SG order parameter q, which is experimentally associated with\nthe deviation of the observed equilibrium (field-cooled)\nsusceptibility \u03c7(T, H) from Curie behavior.26 Normalization to satisfy 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1 yields\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015 \u0012 \u0013\nC\nC\nq(T, H) =\n\u03c70 +\n\u2212 \u03c7(T, H) /\n.\n(2)\nT\nT\n\nT < 6.2 K (Tsg )\n\n(b)\n\nT = 6.2 K (Tsg )\n\n50 kOe\n\nq\n\n10 k\n5k\n1k\n500\n\n\u03b2 = 0.7(1)\n\n100\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\nq / | t |\u03b2\n\n101\n100\n\n\u03b2 / \u03c6 = 0.163(5)\n\n100 105\n\n|t|\n\n107\n109\n2\n2\nH ( Oe )\n\n(c)\nT < Tsg\n\u03b2 /\u03c6\n\nq ~ (H2)\n10\n\n-1\n\nT > Tsg\n\n10-2\n\n105\n\nH = 0.05 ~ 50 kOe\n// a-axis\n\n1010\n1015\n\u03c6\n2\nH / | t | ( Oe )\n\n1020\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3. Scaling analysis of the data in Fig. 1. SG order\nparameter q as a function of (a) reduced temperature t and (b)\nfield squared H 2 . (c) Scaling plot of the SG order parameter.\n\nThe same SG features as for x = 0.05 were observed\nfor x = 0.06 and 0.07. The critical exponents obtained\nin this manner do not depend on x, although Tsg decreases with x. We note that, in addition to the comparable values of Tsg , the critical exponents are found\nto be almost identical to those of Sr-LCO,6,7 suggesting the existence of the same SG state in both systems. While the observed exponents are consistent with\nthose of canonical SG materials,6 we note that recent\nresults for untwinned Sr-LCO crystals reveal unconventional anisotropic behavior.27\nFor x < 0.03, the magnetic susceptibility differs from\nthat for x > 0.03. Data for x = 0.02 are shown in\nFig. 4(a). Two magnetic anomalies are present. One is a\nhigh-temperature cusp associated with the AF transition\nwhich has already been observed in powder samples.21 As\nshown in Fig. 4(b), neutron data complement the SQUID\nobservations, providing unambiguous evidence of a welldefined N\u00e9el transition around this high-temperature\nbump. We have confirmed the development of the antiferromagnetic peak at the (1,0,0) position (orthorhombic\nnotation) just below the susceptibility anomaly, and determined the N\u00e9el temperature to be TN = 135 K. The\nsecond anomaly, recognized well below TN , appears somewhat analogous to the SG behavior found for x > 0.03\nin that we find hysteresis below the anomaly and the\nonset temperature of magnetic irreversibility is comparable to Tsg for x > 0.03. Neutron characterization furthermore revealed a sharp structural transition from the\ntetragonal to orthorhombic phase at 490 K, consistent\nwith a doping level of x = 0.02.21 This indicates that\n\nTheoretically, the SG transition should obey a scaling\nrelation26 as observed in other critical phenomena. Using\nthe reduced temperature t = (T \u2212 Tsg )/Tsg and a scaling\nfunction F\u00b1 (z), the SG order parameter is defined as\nq(T, H) = |t|\u03b2 F\u00b1 (H 2 /|t|\u03c6 ),\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b3 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b2 are the critical exponents characterizing the SG state.26 The behavior of the scaling\nfunction F\u00b1 (z) is well known in the following three limits: (i) F+ (z \u2192 0) = 0 (t > 0), (ii) F\u2212 (z \u2192 0) = const\n(t < 0), and (iii) F\u00b1 (z \u2192 \u221e) = z \u03b2/\u03c6 . Because a relation\nq \u223c t\u03b2 is immediately found from limit (ii), the exponent \u03b2 can be estimated from the slope in a log-log plot\nof q (below Tsg ) versus t in the limit of zero field. Such\nan analysis is performed in Fig. 3(a), and an estimate of\n\u03b2 = 0.7(1) is obtained. Similarly, using the limit (iii),\nthe other exponent, \u03c6, can be determined from the dependence of q on H 2 at Tsg from the relation q(Tsg , H)\n= (H 2 )\u03b2/\u03c6 . The slope in Fig. 3(b) then gives \u03b2/\u03c6 =\n0.163(5) or \u03c6 = 4.3(8).\nNow that we have a good estimate of the critical exponents, we can directly test the scaling relation described\nby Eq. (3). As shown in Fig. 3(c), we obtain excellent\nscaling. Through the process of getting the best scaling result, shown in Fig. 3(c), the critical exponents have\nbeen optimized further: \u03b2 = 0.78(5) and \u03b3 = 4.1(5).\n3\n\n\fIntensity ( a. u. )\n\n-7\n\nM / H ( 10 emu / g )\n\nour samples have a high degree of chemical homogeneity,\nand that the observed magnetic anomaly is intrinsic to\nthe x = 0.02 phase. Local-probe 139 La-NQR and \u03bcSR\nexperiments have reported a corresponding spin-freezing\nwithin the AF state in Sr-LCO (Refs. 3 and 9) and LiLCO.22 This has been ascribed to the continuous freezing\nof the spins of the doped holes on the antiferromagnetic\nbackground,3 with independent ordering of Cu2+ spins\nand doped holes,9 or due to a collective hole behavior.22\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, this spin freezing\nhas not been reported thus far from bulk magnetometry for the cuprates. Because the SG behavior is very\nsensitive to the dopant concentration (x-dependence will\nbe discussed later) and to the field direction, the success\nof the present observations depended greatly on highquality single crystals as well as extended measurements\nin the low-temperature region.\nAlthough the second anomaly appears to be a SG transition, further characterization in terms of critical scaling\nanalysis is not possible due to the ambiguity in the definition of the SG order parameter. Nevertheless, it would\nbe worthwhile to determine a characteristic freezing temperature, Tf . We define Tf as the lower-temperature\n\"shoulder\" of the zero-field-cooled data at low H, which\ncorresponds to the onset of magnetic hysteresis for x =\n0.02, as seen in the inset of Fig. 4(a). We note that, although not shown here, a change in the imaginary part\nof the ac susceptibility was also observed at this temperature, which can be associated with the drastic change\nof the spin response due to the onset of the spin freezing.\n\nTN\n\nLa2Cu1-xLixO4\n\n4\n\n( x = 0.02 )\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n20\n\nH = 0.1 kOe // a-axis\n\n(100) AF-peak\n\n100\n\n200\n\n3\n\nTsg\n\n0.04\n0.08\nx in La2Cu1-xLixO4\nor La 2-xSrxCuO4\n\nOur results yield the phase diagram summarized in\nFig. 5. NQR (x < 0.02) (Ref. 3) and magnetometry\n(x > 0.02) (Ref. 7) data from Sr-LCO single crystals are\nincluded for comparison. Despite the different nature of\nthe dopants, the phase boundaries for these two compounds are almost identical. Figure 5 demonstrates that\nTf \u223c x as in Sr-LCO, opposite to the trend with doping\nfor either TN or Tsg . We find Tf = (339 (14) K) \u00d7 x, as\ncompared to Tf \u2248 (815 K) \u00d7 x for Sr-LCO from 139 La\nNQR.3\nThe dopant concentrations at which N\u00e9el order is lost\nin the two materials differ by a factor of \u223c 2/3. Qualitatively, this shift of the phase boundaries can be understood to result from reduced magnetic frustration in the\nLi-doped system.28 As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, when\nnormalized by that factor, Tsg for Li-LCO (x > 0.03)\nquantitatively agrees with the SG temperature for SrLCO. Since NQR and magnetometry probe very different\ntime scales, systematic Sr-LCO magnetometry data for\nx < 0.02 would be very desirable for a proper quantitative comparison at low doping.\nRecent neutron scattering results reveal direct evidence for electronic phase separation in Sr-LCO (x <\n0.02) into regions with hole concentrations \u2248 0 and\n\u2248 0.02.4 The latter phase exhibits diagonal stripes.7\nSpin freezing occurs below the doping-independent phase\nseparation temperature Tps \u2248 30 K determined from\nneutron scattering,4 and consistent with previous NQR\nresults.3 For Li-LCO, on the other hand, commensurate AF correlations have been both predicted29 and\nobserved,23 consistent with the expected stronger pinning\npotential of the in-plane dopant Li+ . Consequently, the\ncluster model, originally proposed for Sr-LCO, but which\npredicts commensurate AF correlations, might more accurately describe the physics of the Li-doped variant.16\n\nTN\n\n0\n\n1\n2\nx / xc\n\nInset: scaled phase diagram.\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 5.

The power-law fit\n(solid curve) gives TN = 135 K, which corresponds well to\nthe cusp in the susceptibility.\n\n4\n\n\fphase, the spin glass phase boundaries differ by a mere\nscale factor for the effective doping level. The experimental results for Li-LCO obtained here extend the universality of the bulk magnetic phase diagram to hole-doped\nbut non-superconducting cuprates.\n\nThis model predicts kB Tf \u223c Jeff x, where Jeff is the effective in-plane exchange coupling constant.16 While this\nlinear doping dependence is indeed consistent with our\nobservations, the same behavior is found in Sr-LCO.3 On\nthe other hand, it has been speculated that Tf in Sr-LCO\nmight depend linearly on the volume fraction of the SG\nphase.4 The close analogy between the NQR (Refs. 3\nand 22) and bulk magnetic properties of the two materials suggests that Li-LCO might phase separate as well.\nAt higher hole concentrations, the behavior of the carriers differs significantly between Li-LCO and Sr-LCO.\nThe latter material shows an insulator to metal transition and HTS, while the former remains insulating. What\nis particularly interesting from our present observations\nis that, in spite of the great difference in charge dynamics for x > 0.03, the spin degrees of freedom measured\nvia magnetometry are remarkably similar in both compounds. Both materials show a spin glass transition, with\ncomparable transition temperatures at the same doping\nvalue and with the same critical exponents. The values of Tsg (x) for the more disordered material Li-LCO\nlie above those of Sr-LCO. The relative shift of the SG\nphase boundaries likely results from an effective decrease\nof magnetic frustration due to the presence of nonmagnetic Li+ in Li-LCO.28 In this context, it is worth noting\nthat the magnetic phase boundaries in the double-layer\ncuprates9,10 lie above those of both Li-LCO and Sr-LCO.\nWhile differences in the strength and type of disorder\nmight play a subtle role in setting the temperature scales\nfor N\u00e9el and SG order, we believe that the predominant\neffect is the difference in the effective three-dimensional\nAF coupling between single- and double-layer materials. Specifically, while the interplanar AF coupling is\nnearly frustrated in doped LCO, this is not the case for\nthe double-layer materials. On the other hand, the relative insensitivity of the low-temperature magnetic phase\nboundaries of the structurally identical materials Li-LCO\nand Sr-LCO to the type and strength of the quenched disorder is consistent with the notion that the glassiness in\nthese doped Mott insulators is primarily self-generated.17\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank D.

Our results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting low-temperature freezing temperatures\nin the N\u00e9el state from magnetometry, and call for similar\nmeasurements in other cuprates for a proper quantitative\ncomparison. We find that Tf \u223c x, which also has been\nreported for Sr-LCO. Since the spin freezing in the latter material occurs in a phase separated state, the close\nsimilarity between the doping dependence of the freezing\ntemperature suggests that lightly doped Li-LCO might\nphase separate as well, despite the stronger pinning potential of the in-plane dopant Li+ .
