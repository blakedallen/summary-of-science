Anandan)\n3. a geometric interpretation of the nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase in terms of\nholonomies of the Stiefel connection on the U(1)-universal-bundle (performed by Yakir\nAharonov and Jeeva Anandan themselves and refined and improved by Arno Bohm\nand Al\u00ed Mostafazadeh)\nonly the first of these conceptual step has been performed as to classical Hannay phase\n[4] whose bundle-theoretic interpretation has been shown by Ennio Gozzi and William D.\nThacker [5].\nSince Hannay's analysis applies to a very particular class of dynamical systems (the\nintegrable hamiltonian ones) I will follow here a radically different approach consisting in:\n1. considering the holonomies of the Stiefel connection on the U(1)-universal-bundle associated to the Koopman representation of an arbitrary classical dynamical system\n2. investigating their physical meanings as non adiabatic classical geometric phases\n3. obtaining the Hannay's result as a particular case\n\n4\n\n\fIII.\n\nHOLONOMIES IN THE KOOPMAN REPRESENTATION\n\nGiven an arbitrary classical dynamical system (X , \u03c3 , \u03bc , T ) (where hence (X , \u03c3 , \u03bc) is\na classical probability space and T is an automorphism of its) [6], [7] let us introduce the\nKoopman unitary UT : H 7\u2192 H:\n(UT f )(x) := (f \u25e6 T )(x) f \u2208 H\n\n(3.1)\n\nH := L2 (X, \u03bc)\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith:\n\nLet us now consider the U(1)-universal-bundle (cfr. e.g. the mathematical appendix [8]\nof [2] or [9]) S(H)(P (H) , U(1)) whose base-space (i.e. the U(1)-classifying-space) is\nthe space of all the rays in H, whose total space S(H) is the unit sphere in H:\nS(H) := {|\u03c8 >\u2208 H < \u03c8|\u03c8 > = 1}\n\n(3.3)\n\nand whose structure group is clearly U(1).\nEndowed the U(1)-universal bundle S(H)(P H , U(1)) with the Stiefel connection \u03c9Stief el\nlet us denote by HOLStief el (|\u03c8 >) the holonomy group in |\u03c8 > of \u03c9Stief el :\n\u03c9\n\nHOLStief el (|\u03c8 >) := {ei\u03b8 \u2208 U(1) : \u03c4\u03b3 Stief el (|\u03c8 >) = ei\u03b8 |\u03c8 > } \u03b3 \u2208 C|\u03c8><\u03c8| (P H)\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03c9\n\nwhere

consider the hamiltonian dynamical system with configuration space R2 and hamiltonian H : T \u22c6 R2 7\u2192 R given by:\nH(~q, ~p) := H1 + H2\n\nHi (~qi , ~pi ) =\n\n1 2\n(~pi + \u03c9i2~qi2 ) i =

).\nSince we have seen that our dynamical system may be seen as (T 2 , \u03c3Borel , d\u03bc(\u03c61, \u03c62 ) :=\nd\u03c61 d\u03c62\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n, Tt ) the passage to the Koopman representation involves the unitary operator UTt\n\nover H := L2 (T 2 , d\u03bc(\u03c61, \u03c62 )) identified by its action on the basis:\n~ ~n \u2208 Z2 }\nE := { |~n >:= exp(i~n * \u03c6)\n\n(3.10)\n\nUTt |~n > =

matrix w.r.t. the canonical basis is given by:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 1\n\uf8f8\nC := \uf8ed\n1 2\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe passage to the Koopman representation involves again the unitary operator UC over\nH :=

the next section.\n\n7\n\n\fIV.\n\nTHE PHYSICAL MEANING OF THE CLASSICAL GEOMETRIC PHASE IN\n\nTERM OF MOVING FRAMES\n\nIn the previous section we have introduced, in the Koopman representation of a classical dynamical system, the mathematical setting underlying, in a quantum context, the\nAharonov-Anandan (non-adiabatic) quantum geometric phase.\nIn this paragraph we will explore the physical meaning of the resulting (non adiabatic)\nclassical geometric phase.\nLet us start observing that, contrary to the quantum case, P H doesn't represent the pure\nstates of the system but simply a particular class of physical observables observed up to a\nphase\n\n1\n\n.\n\nIt is important, with this regard, to observe, that, contrary to the quantum case, the\nneglected phase do have here physical meaning, since |\u03c8 > and exp(i\u03b8)|\u03c8 > are physically\ndistinguishable.\nLet us observe, furthermore, that the similarity between the evolution equation of an\nobservable |\u03c8 >\u2208 H:\n|\u03c8(t = 1) > = UT |\u03c8(t = 0) >\n\n(4.1)\n\nand the evolution-equation of Quantum Mechanics in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture is deceptive\nsince in our classical Koopmanian situation we are in the Heisenberg picture according\nto which the observables evolve with time while the state \u03c9\u03bc : L2 (X , d\u03bc) 7\u2192 C:\nZ\n\u03c9\u03bc (f ) :=\nf d\u03bc\n\n(4.2)\n\nX\n\ndoesn't evolve with time.\nConsidered a basis of H:\nE := { |n > , n \u2208 N}\n\n(4.3)\n\nlet us consider the associated family of projectors\n\nP E := { |n >< n| , n \u2208 N}\n\n(4.4)\n\nIt determines the frame we use to decompose and consequentially analyze the particular\nclass of physical observables constitued by the elements of H.\n1\n\nWe are admitting here a class of physical observables H broader than the usually accepted one L\u221e (X, \u03bc)\n\n8\n\n\fWhen such a frame is allowed to move for a second following a loop \u03b3 \u2208 C|n><n|(P H):\n\u03b3 : [0, 1] 7\u2192 P H : \u03b3(t = 0) = \u03b3(t = 1) = |n >< n|\n\n(4.5)\n\nthe way the physical observables of H observed, through it, appear to us in the time\ninterval (0, 1) is the net result of two effects:\n1. the real dynamical evolution of the frame\n2. the motion of the frame we are performing making it to follow the prescribed loop\nAt time t=1 the state of affairs of our observables aren't identical to that we would have if\n\u03c9\n\nwe hadn't moved our frame: they differ precisely by the geometric phase \u03c4\u03b3 Stief el (|n >) :=\nexp(i\u03b8) as it may be more clearly visualized in the examples:\nExample IV.1\nNON ADIABATIC GEOMETRIC PHASE OF THE UNCOUPLED OSCILLATORS\nAt time t = 1 we will have that:\n|~n(t = 1) > = ei\u03b8 UTt |~n > = exp(i~n * ~\u03c9 t + \u03b8) |~n >\n\n(4.6)\n\nExample IV.2\nARNOLD CAT\nAt time t = 1 we will have that:\n|~n(t = 1) > = exp(i\u03b8)UC |~n > = exp(i\u03b8)|C ~n >\n\n9\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fV.\n\nTHE RECOVERING OF HANNAY ANGLE IN THE ADIABATIC CASE\n\nThe link between the fibre-bundle setting underlying the Aharonov-Anandan (nonadiabatic) quantum geometric phase and the fibre-bundle setting underlying Berry adiabatic\nquantum geometric phase (discovered by Barry Simon) has been mathematically characterized by A. Bohm amd Al\u00ed Mostafazadeh simply through a suitable pull-back of the involved\nfibre bundle.\nIt is then reasonable that both the fibre-bundle setting underlying Hannay adiabatic\nclassical geometric phase and its link with the non adiabatic classical geometric phase discusssed in the previous sections may be simply obtained mimicking the Bohm-Mostafazadehpullback.\nLetc us consider an Hamiltonian integrable dynamical system [10] with motion-equation,\n~ given by:\nin the angle-action variables (I~ , \u03c6),\ndI~\n= 0\ndt\n\n(5.1)\n\n~\nd\u03c6\n= ~\u03c9 (I)\ndt\n\n(5.2)\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202 I~\n\n(5.3)\n\nwith:\n~\u03c9 (I) =\n\nIf the dynamical system in analysis has n degrees of freedoms, and hence phase space 2-n\ndimensional, its Koopman description involves the introduction of the Hilbert space:\nH := L2 (T n ,\n\n~\nd\u03c6\n)\n(2\u03c0)n\n\n(5.4)\n\nand of the Koopman unitary Ut identified by its action on the basis:\n~ ~n \u2208 Zn }\nE := { |~n >:= exp(i~n * \u03c6)\n\n(5.5)\n\nUt |~n > = exp(i~n * ~\u03c9 t) |~n >\n\n(5.6)\n\ngiven by:\n\n~ making the parameter R\n~ to evolve\nLet us suppose to alter the hamiltonian H \u2192 H(R)\nadiabatically realizing a loop in a suitable parameter space M.\n\n10\n\n\fIn the adiabatic limit the basis:\n~ > ~n \u2208 Zn , R\n~ \u2208 M}\nER~ := { |~n, R\n\n(5.7)\n\ncontinues to be formed by eigenvectors of Ut .\nLet us then introduce the following map f~n : Zn \u00d7 M 7\u2192 P H:\n~ := |~n, R\n~ >< ~n, R|\n~\nf~n (R)\n\n(5.8)\n\nObviously f~n may also be seen as a ~n-parametrized family of maps with domain M and\ncodomain P H.\nLet us then introduce the pullback-bundle f~n\u22c6 S(H) of the Stiefel bundle S(H)(P H, U(1))\nby f~n and let us denote by f \u22c6 \u03c9Stief el the connection on the principal bundle f~n\u22c6 S(H) induced\nby the Stiefel connection \u03c9Stief el through the pull-back operation.\nf \u22c6 \u03c9Stief el\n\nGiven a loop \u03b3 \u2208 CR=0\n(M) the associated Hannay phase is then \u03c4\u03b3\n~\n\n11\n\n.\n\n\f[1] M.
