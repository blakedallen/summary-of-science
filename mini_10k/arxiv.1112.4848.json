X-ray emitting gas cools at a rate\nof tcool \u221d 1/n (where n is the gas density), suggesting a substantial mass (\u223c1012 M\u2299 ) of cool gas should\nbe deposited into the central regions and form stars\n(for a review see Fabian 1994). In typical cases cooling rates of 50\u2013100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 are expected rising as high\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:s.l.hamer@durham.ac.uk\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nas >500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in the most extreme systems, although sub-mm observations did not detect this gas in\nmolecular form (O'Dea et al. 1994). However, through\nsystematic surveys for CO in clusters, molecular gas\nmasses of 109\u221211 M\u2299 have been found (Edge 2001;\nSalom\u00e9 & Combes 2003). More recent X-ray observations have revealed much reduced cooling rates (\u223c1\u201310\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 ) with a sharp truncation in cooling at low (< 1\nkeV) X-ray temperatures, suggesting a continuous feedback effect is reheating the gas. This heavily suppressed\ncooling has reduced the large discrepancy between gas deposition rate and observed molecular gas (see the review\nby Peterson & Fabian 2006).\nThe clusters X-ray luminosity and temperature re-\n\n\f2\n\nHamer et al.\n\nlate closely to the intrinsic luminosity of the BCG\n(Schombert 1987, 1988; Edge & Stewart 1991a,b). This\nconnection between the BCG and cluster properties\nmakes BCGs an important tool for studying clusters.\nSince the dense environment at the centre of clusters\nmeans that BCG experiences a much higher ICM pressure\nthan any other cluster member galaxy radiative cooling\nis at its strongest and gas cooling from the hot phase can\nbe accreted onto the BCG, fuelling its evolution. However, these regions are also densely populated by other\ngalaxies making the likelihood of interactions and mergers much more likely. Both mergers and gas accretion are\ntherefore likely to play important roles in the growth and\nevolution of the BCG and cluster core (Tremaine 1990;\nWilman et al. 2006).\nMany BCGs of the most rapidly cooling cluster cores\nexhibit optical line emission (Cavagnolo et al. 2008).\nCrawford et al. (1999) found significant line emission in\n32 per cent of a sample of 201 BCGs selected from\nthe BCS X-ray selected sample (Ebeling et al. 1998).\nThis line emitting gas at 104 K traces filamentary\nstructures around the BCG (Hatch et al. 2005, 2006;\nMcDonald et al. 2011) and direct comparison has shown\nqualitatively similar structures in the 107 K X-ray\n(Fabian et al. 2008) and 30 K molecular (Salom\u00e9 et al.\n2011) gas. This structural similarity suggests that the\ngas phases are linked and as such, studying the line emitting gas can give an insight into the physical mechanisms\noperating within the cluster cores.\nIn order to measure the emission line structure of the\ngas within a more complete sample of clusters we have\nobtained spatially resolved spectroscopy around the redshifted H\u03b1 emission of 77 BCGs (Hamer et al. in preparation). Here, we report observations of three extreme systems (Abell 1991, Abell 3444 and the Ophiuchus cluster)\nfrom our parent sample which show a significant component ( > 50 per cent) of their line emission significantly\noffset from the central BCG. A1991 and A3444 are unique\nfrom the rest of the sample in that the rest frame optical\nline emission is significantly offset from the BCG. Figure 1 shows the physical offset between the BCG and the\npeak H\u03b1 emission for the whole sample of 77 line emitting BCGs (Hamer et al. in preparation). It can clearly\nbe seen here that the offsets for the majority of the sample fall below the seeing limit of the VIMOS observations\n(1.5\u2032\u2032 ) with A1991 and A3444 having 9-13 kpc offsets.\nWe first outline our observations and data reduction (\u00a72) followed by a summary of how we completed\nour analysis (\u00a73). In \u00a74 we present our results before discussing their implications in \u00a75. Finally a summary and\nconclusions are reported in \u00a76. We assume \u03a9m =0.27,\n\u039b = 0.73 and Ho = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 throughout. This\ncorresponds to a physical scale of 1.12 kpc/\u2032\u2032 for A1991,\n3.91 kpc/\u2032\u2032 for A3444 and 0.55 kpc/\u2032\u2032 for Ophiuchus.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA\nREDUCTION\n\nObservations of the BCG in A1991 were taken using\nthe Visible Multiobject Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument on the 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT) in April\n\nFigure 1. Observed physical offset between the BCG and the\nmajority of the line emission in our parent sample of 77 BCGs\n(Hamer et al. in preparation). The dashed lines show constant\noffsets in 1.5\u2032\u2032 steps. The dot-dashed line shows the extent of\nthe VIMOS field of view (\u223c 12\u2032\u2032 as the BCG was positioned\nat the centre of the field of view). The majority of objects\nfall well below the average seeing limit of 1.5\u2032\u2032 but A1991 and\nA3444 stand out with offsets of 9\u201313 kpc.\n\nof 2008 and May of 2010. Observations were made at\ntwo positions one centred on the BCG and the second\n\u223c 10 \u2032\u2032 north of the first to cover the peak in X-ray\nemission. At both locations a set of three 600 second exposures were performed with a pointing dither included\nbetween each exposure to account for bad pixels. The\nHR Orange Grism and GG435 filter (spectral resolution\nof R \u223c \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u223c 2650 over the wavelength range 5250\u20137400\n\u00c5) were used to observe H\u03b1 (\u03bbrest 6562.8 \u00c5) at the redshift of the cluster of 0.0587. Observations of A3444 where\ntaken with VIMOS in June 2008 using the HR Red Grism\nand GG475 filter (spectral resolution R \u223c \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u223c 3100\ncovering the wavelength range 6450\u20138600 \u00c5) to observe\nH\u03b1 at the cluster redshift of 0.2533. The observations\nwere taken in a range of conditions, with a seeing of \u223c\n0.7\u2032\u2032 \u20131.3\u2032\u2032 .\nThe raw data were reduced using the esorex package. This package performed the basic data reduction including bias subtractions, flat fielding and the wavelength\nand flux calibrations. To subtract the sky we masked any\npoint-like objects to remove any stars within the field.\nThe BCG was then removed from the field by masking\nall pixels within an isophote of half its peak intensity.\nThe sky level for each quadrant was then calculated by\ntaking the median value of the remaining pixels at each\nwavelength increment. This sky spectrum was then subtracted from each pixel in the four quadrants before they\nwere combine into a single datacube. Finally we median\ncombined the three exposures for each pointing in order\nto eliminate cosmic rays. To mosaic the two positions of\nA1991 we determine the exact offset between the BCG in\nboth observations and combined them to create a cube\nwith a \u223c 36\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 38\u2032\u2032 field of view.\nThe Ophiuchus cluster BCG (hereafter Ophiuchus)\nwas observed by Edwards et al. (2009) using Gemini\nMulti-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the 8.1m Gemini\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fOffset optical line emission in cluster cores\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Left: A continuum image (\u03bb = 6000-7000 \u00c5) created from the VIMOS datacube. Overplotted as contours is the H\u03b1\nemission at 6, 12, 18 and 24\u03c3 (with 1\u03c3 = 9.4 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcsec\u22122 ). The H\u03b1 emission is double peaked with one\ncomponent on the BCG but extending north by 10\u2032\u2032 where a second component can be seen. Centre-Left: The continuum image\nshowing the optical stellar component of the BCG with the X-ray map overlayed as contours. The peak in the X-rays is offset\nby \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 north of the BCG. Centre-Right: The H\u03b1 velocity field for A1991, as derived from fits to the H\u03b1 - [NII] complex. The\nvelocities are given relative to a redshift z=0.0591. Right: The FWHM of the H\u03b1 line emission deconvolved for instrumental\nresolution. The crosses mark the location of the two H\u03b1 components on each plot. The plots are centred at RA = 14:54:31.567\nand Dec = 18:38:32.70 (J2000). There is a component of H\u03b1 emission offset to the north of the BCG by \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 which coincides\nwith the position of the peak in the soft X-ray emission. The velocity gradient along this offset shows a dynamical link still exists\nbetween the BCG and the Peak of ICM cooling.\n\nSouth Telescope (Gemini). This object was selected from\nthe literature as it is the best other example of a BCG\nshowing significant offset between the BCG, the X-ray\npeak and the line emission (Million & Allen 2009). The\nobservations of Ophiuchus consisted of four 1500 second\nexposures which were combined to give a total integration\ntime of 6000 seconds. The R400+r grating (spectral resolution R \u223c \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u223c 1918 covering the wavelength range\n5620\u20136980 \u00c5) was used to ensure coverage of H\u03b1 at the\ncluster redshift of 0.0280 (Lahav et al. 1989). The seeing\nduring these observations was \u223c 0.8\u2032\u2032 to 1\u2032\u2032 .\nThe data were reduced using GMOS specific tools in\nthe Gemini IRAF package, which included bias subtraction, flat fielding and wavelength calibration. Sky subtraction was preformed by isolating the fibres from a secondary IFU situated \u223c 1\u2032 away from the primary IFU.\nThese fibres were then used to create a sky spectrum\nwhich was subtracted from the fibres containing the observations. Cosmic rays were then rejected by comparing\nthe spectrum from each fibre to that from neighbouring\nfibres and rejecting any element which had a value exceeding ten times the Poisson noise. The individual exposures were then combined into a single datacube which\ncovers a region centred on the BCG of \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032\u2032 .\nWe obtained IRAM 30m data for the CO(1-0) and\nCO(2-1) lines in A1991 on 21st April 2010. The observations were performed in reasonable conditions (\u03c4225GHz \u223c\n0.1 \u2212 0.2) with the EMIR receiver using a 4 GHz bandwidth covering each line. Two positions were observed,\nthe BCG and the optical line peak 11\u2032\u2032 north, each for 1\nhour duration with wobbler switching with a 90\u2032\u2032 throw.\nThe observations reached a noise level of 0.6 mK and\n1.3 mK in 44 km s\u22121 bins (16 and 32 MHz) for CO(10) and CO(2-1) lines respectively. Both the 4 MHz and\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\nWilma backends were used to sample the data but the\nnoise performance of the 4 MHz backend was considerably better so only the 4 MHz data are presented here.\nIRAM 30m observations of CO(1-0) in A3444 were\nobtained on 29th December 2006, before the VIMOS IFU\nobservations, in very good conditions (\u03c4225GHz < 0.1)\nwith the A/B100 receivers with a 400 MHz bandwidth\nfor 1 hour duration using wobbler switching with a 90\u2032\u2032\nthrow. These observations reached 0.8 mK in 52 km s\u22121\nbins (16 MHz). At the time of writing, we are aware of\nno observations of CO in Ophiuchus.\n\n3\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWe use the integral field spectroscopy to investigate the\nspatial variation of line emission and kinematics within\nthe clusters. We fitted gaussian emission line profiles to\nthe region of the spectra containing the H\u03b1 (\u03bbrest 6562.8\n\u00c5) and [NII] (\u03bbrest 6548.1/6583 \u00c5) in each lenslet. We\nused a \u03c72 minimisation procedure and allowed the velocity, intensity and linewidth of the H\u03b1 line, as well\nas the continuum level to vary independently. The [NII]\nlines were fixed to the same velocity and linewidth as\nH\u03b1, the [NII] intensity was allowed to vary but the ratio of [NII]6548.1/[NII]6583 was fixed to 0.3. The profiles\nwere fitted to each 0.6\u2032\u2032 pixel and adaptively binned to\n1.8\u2032\u2032 in regions with lower H\u03b1 flux. As such the low surface brightness emission has a lower resolution than the\nbrightest regions.\nThese fits were accepted as representing the data\nwhen they provided an improvement over a continuum\nonly fit at the 7\u03c3 significance level and when an acceptable fit was found the parameters of the best fit model\nwere stored. These parameters were then used to produce\n\n\f4\n\nHamer et al.\n\nFigure 3. Upper IRAM 30m EMIR spectrum for A1991 on\nthe BCG.

Significant CO emission is detected at both the position of the BCG (3.8\u03c3) and the offset\nH\u03b1 emission (3.0\u03c3) and there is a small velocity offset in the\nline centroid between them.\n\nmaps of H\u03b1 flux, relative velocity and linewidth(FWHM\ndeconvolved for instrumental resolution). Continuum images of the region covered by the observations were also\nproduced by taking the median of the emission from each\nlenslet over a region of the spectra containing no emission lines or sky line residuals (here after referred to as\ncollapsing the cube).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nAbell 1991\n\nIn Figure 2 we show the continuum image of A1991 (collapsed over \u03bb = 6000-7000 \u00c5) and overlay contours of H\u03b1\nline emission. It is apparent that while there is a component of the H\u03b1 emission centred on the BCG a more\nextended clump is present 9\u2032\u2032 north lying off the bright\nstellar component, a projected physical offset of \u223c 10 kpc\nat the cluster redshift of 0.0587 (Struble & Rood 1999).\nTable 1 shows the values of the variable parameters\nfor the minimised fits to the emission on the BCG, off\nthe BCG (labelled on Figure 2 as regions A and B respectively) and the emission from the connecting gas.\nThese fits show that the offset clump contains the majority (\u223c55 per cent) of the H\u03b1 emission within the system.\nA1991 also is known to have a significant offset (\u223c\n10\u2032\u2032 ) between the position of the BCG and the X-ray\npeak (Sharma et al. 2004). Figure 2 shows that the bright\npeak in the X-ray gas lies roughly 10\u2032\u2032 (11 kpc) to the\n\nnorth of the BCG and within 3 kpc of a similar peak\nin H\u03b1 emission. This bright X-ray peak corresponds to\nthe lowest temperature gas in the cluster and the region\nwhere the gas is cooling most rapidly. This shows that\nthe majority of the H\u03b1 emitting gas is related to the\nmost rapidly cooling region of the ICM rather than being\nco-located with the BCG. Analysis of the Chandra data\nindicates that the pressure in the core of the cluster is\nrelatively uniform between the BCG and the cooler, offset\npeak implying that the enhanced density at the peak is\nbalanced by a lower temperature (Sharma et al. 2004).\nIn Figure 2 we show the velocity and linewidth maps\nproduced from the fits to the individual lenslets. We note\nthat the velocity map shows a continuous velocity gradient from the position of the BCG along a connecting filament to the offset emission. This suggests that the two\ncomponents, while physically separated remain kinematically linked. To determine the velocity difference between\nthe two components we extracted spectra from an 8\u2032\u2032 by\n7\u2032\u2032 aperture centred on the BCG and on the offset component (marked A and B on the velocity map of Figure\n2). We find a velocity difference of 124 \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 between the two components. The linewidth (FWHM) of\nthe emission from the BCG is greater (205 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 )\nthan that from the offset component (152 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 ).\nNext, we combine the H\u03b1 and the CO properties\nto investigate the relation between warm and cold gas\nwithin the cluster core. By virtue of the good conditions,\nthe relative sensitivity between the two lines with EMIR\nstrongly favours the CO(2-1) line. We obtain a significant\ndetection of it in both positions (Figure 3) of 3.8\u03c3 on the\nBCG and 3.0\u03c3 on the offset line emission. The significance of the line detection was calculated using the variance of the signal away from the line compared to the line\nstrength. By this measure there are two candidate lines\nat -1250 and +930 km s\u22121 in the offset observation but,\nif they are real, are unlikely to be related to the BCG.\nThe separation of the two positions is just smaller\nthan the IRAM beam at this frequency (10.3\u2032\u2032 vs 10.9\u2032\u2032 )\nand the measured velocity of the emission is offset by\nmore than half the line width. \u00bfFrom the separation and\nprofile of the beam we estimate a less than 10 per cent\ncontamination between the two pointings. Therefore the\ngas is likely to be spatially extended on a scale comparable, but not necessarily identical to, the optical emission\nlines. The velocity difference in CO(2-1) between the two\npositions is -40 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121 in the same direction as the\nshift we observe in H\u03b1 but 84 km s\u22121 . lower. This difference may be related to the bulk flow of the cold molecular\ngas or a different overall distribution with respect to the\nBCG compared to that traced by the optical lines. The\nsignificance of this velocity difference and its potential\norigin are beyond the scope of these single dish observations but could be addressed with deeper interferometry\nwith PdBI or ALMA.\nThe detection of CO 10\u2032\u2032 north of the BCG in\nA1991 makes this the fourth system where extended\nCO has been found (e.g. NGC1275 Salom\u00e9 et al. (2006),\nA1795 Salom\u00e9 & Combes (2004) and RXJ0821+07\nEdge & Frayer (2003)). In all of these systems the extended CO coincides with extended H\u03b1 emission.

This component matches the direction of an extent in the soft X-ray emission.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\f6\n\nHamer et al.\n\nmasses of \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 for A1991 is consistent with\nthe correlation of molecular gas mass and optical line luminosity in Edge (2001) and with the star formation rate\ninferred from the MIR continuum (O'Dea et al. 2008).\nHowever, current observations cannot spatially resolve\nwhether the star formation in the offset gas follows the\ncorrelation found for gas within the BCG (O'Dea et al.\n2008).\n\n4.2\n\nAbell 3444\n\nA3444 also shows a substantial factor (\u223c63 per cent) of\noptical line emission offset from the BCG. In Figure 4 we\nshow a FORS2 R band image of the central region of the\ncluster with contours from H\u03b1 line emission. A clear extension in the line emission can be seen to the southwest\nwhere a secondary peak is apparent. This component is\noffset from the BCG by \u223c 3.2\u2032\u2032 or \u223c 12.5 kpc at the cluster\nredshift of 0.2533 (Struble & Rood 1999). In this cluster\nthe line emission form the BCG and offset location are\nconsistent within errors at \u223c 40% of the total line flux\neach (Table 1).\nThe X-ray observations of this system show a weak\nbut significant point like source (Lx (0.5-10 keV) \u223c 4 \u00d7\n1043 ergs s\u22121 in a 1.5\u2032\u2032 aperture and a power law spectrum) coincident with the BCG that has a relatively\nhard spectrum compared to the cluster emission (Figure 5) suggesting the presence of an AGN. While the\npoint source is centred on the BCG (Figure 4), the soft\nX-ray emission shows an extension in the same direction\nas the offset optical line emission (Figure 4) although, like\nA1991, it is not exactly coincident with the offset peak\nin the line emission.\nTo determine the temperature of the gas in at the location of the BCG we fit a mekal thermal plasma model\n(Mewe et al. 1985, 1986) to the 0.5\u20135.0 keV emission from\na 1.5\u2032\u2032 aperture centred on the BCG. This found the temperature of the gas to be > 7.5 keV which is high for a\nplasma model suggesting a contribution to the hard X-ray\nemission from an AGN component. The presence of an\nAGN in the BCG would produce increased X-ray counts\nwhich could shift the apparent centre of the cluster emission. As such the AGN contribution must be accounted\nfor when determining the true centre of ICM cooling.\nTo subtract the AGN emission from the soft X-ray\nemission on the BCG (and find the true level of the extended cluster emission) we determine the normalisation\nof the point source in the 2.0\u20135.0 keV band and apply this\nto the emission from the 0.5\u20131.5 keV band. To do this we\nfirst determine the properties of the cluster 2.0\u20135.0 keV\nemission from an annulus surrounding the point source.\nWe then fit an absorbed power law plus an absorbed\nmekal plasma model to the point source 2.0\u20135.0 keV emission with the properties of the mekal component fixed to\nthose from the surrounding annulus. Finally we apply the\nsame model to the point source 0.5\u20131.5 keV emission with\nthe normalisation and photon index of the power law set\nto the values determine from the Hard X-rays and calculate the flux of the two components.\nThe total flux from the point source in the 0.5\u2013\n\u221214\n1.5 keV band is 2.45+0.24\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , of which\n\u22120.20 \u00d710\n\n\u221214\n0.55+0.16\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 comes from the AGN con\u22120.13 \u00d710\ntribution. We find that the cluster emission under the\n\u221214\npoint source is 1.90+0.18\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 while the\n\u22120.15 \u00d710\n\u221214\nextension to the southwest has a flux of 2.4+0.20\n\u22120.12 \u00d710\n\u22122 \u22121\nerg cm s suggesting that it represents the peak in the\nsoft X-ray emission. Analysis of the Chandra data also\nshows that the pressure in the core of A3444 is relatively\nconstant when the AGN emission is excised. Therefore,\nA3444 shows very similar X-ray properties to A1991 with\nan offset peak in soft X-rays but a constant pressure core\non 50\u2013100 kpc scales. In the case of A3444, where the\nAGN in the BCG contributes significantly to the X-ray\nemission, the offset position in the soft X-rays represents\nthe region of maximum cooling of the ICM.\nWithin this system the BCG and offset component\nare separated by a velocity of 100 \u00b1 19 km s\u22121 . We\nalso note that the connecting emission has a higher velocity offset (241 \u00b1 26 km s\u22121 ) than the offset peak.\nThe linewidths in this system are higher in the BCG\n(FWHM= 490 \u00b1 21 km s\u22121 ) than in the offset component (FWHM= 273 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 ) suggesting the gas is\nmore disturbed within the galaxy or that it is the combination of several, related gas clouds. We also note that\nthe lenslet from the centre of the BCG has FWHM > 650\nkm s\u22121 suggesting possible contribution from the AGN\ndetected in the X-ray imaging, that can be seen in the\nlinewidth map in Figure 4.\nIn A3444, the smaller angular extent of the offset\nmeans that only a global measure of the cold molecular\ngas can be obtained from our IRAM observations in this\nsystem and its higher redshift restricts us to just CO(1-0).\nOur observation provides a marginal (2.0\u03c3) detection of\n0.33\u00b10.11 K km s\u22121 and a width of 172\u00b169 km s\u22121 at the\nvelocity of the BCG. However, the restricted bandwidth\nof the A/B100 receiver means that a broader line could\nbe present but is lost in the baseline subtraction. The\nimplied total molecular gas masses of \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299\nfor A3444 is consistent with the correlation of molecular\ngas mass and optical line luminosity in Edge (2001).\n\n4.3\n\nOphiuchus\n\nEdwards et al. (2009) studied the properties of the Ophiuchus cluster with the GMOS IFU and found line emission with a substantial (\u223c 4\u2032\u2032 ) offset from the BCG (Figure 6). Edwards et al. (2009) attributed this offset line\nemission to another galaxy and not to the BCG itself\nbut given the similarity with respect to the X-ray emission to A1991 and A3444 we reconsider this system. In\nour reanalysis of these data we also find that the line\nemission is offset from the BCG by \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 which, at a redshift of z=0.028, corresponds to a projected separation\nof \u223c 2.2 kpc. The line emission within Ophiuchus shows\nno component on the BCG with 100 per cent of the H\u03b1\nemission coming from the offset component.\nMillion et al. (2010) also analyse Chandra X-ray\ndata and find that the X-ray peak in the Ophiuchus cluster is offset from the BCG by \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 , a similar offset to that\nseen in the line emission. In Figure 6 we compare the position of the X-rays and the offset line emission. We note\nthat the GMOS field of view (shown by the dashed green\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fOffset optical line emission in cluster cores\n\nFigure 5.

While our analysis of these data find results consistent with those of Edwards et al. (2009) the alignment\nof the offset H\u03b1 and X-ray emission suggests a situation\nsimilar to that in A1991 and A3444.\nIn this system, there is sufficient S/N in the continuum that we can determine the stellar velocity. We\nextracted a spectrum of the BCG and used a penalised\npixel-fitting method (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004) to fit\nthe Sodium D absorption from a catalogue of stellar templates. Comparison of the H\u03b1 line with the Sodium D(\u03bb\n5889,5895) stellar absorption find that the line emitting\ngas is offset from the BCG by 603 \u00b1 28 km s\u22121 . The\nvelocity and line width maps are shown in Figure 7, the\nkinematics of the gas in this system are simple although\nsome tentative evidence for a velocity structure is apparent to the east of the object (at the edge of the GMOS\nfield of view). Other than this the velocity of the gas\nshows little variation (\u03c3 = 31 km s\u22121 or half the velocity resolution of \u223c 60 km s\u22121 ) and the linewidth is\nuniform across the detected line emission (FWHM = 235\n\u00b1 38 km s\u22121 ). Future, wider field IFU observations are\nrequired to map the full extent and velocity structure of\nthe line emission.\n\n4.4\n\nTime scales\n\nThe conclusion we draw from our extensive optical IFU\nsample (Hamer et al. in preparation) is that the fraction\nof systems in which there is an offset between the majority of the optical line emission and the central galaxy\nof more than 8 kpc is relatively small (\u2248 3 in 77).

The H\u03b1 line emission is offset to the north\nof the BCG. The position of the offset H\u03b1 emission lies near\nthe peak in the X-ray surface brightness. It should be noted\nthat the north-east and north-west edges of the line emission\ncoincide with the edges of the GMOS field of view (shown as\ndashed green lines) so these contours may not represent the\ntrue extent of the H\u03b1.\n\nFigure 7.

Similarly, from X-ray observations of 24 line emitting clusters from the LoCuSS sample (Sanderson et al. 2009) only four are offset from the\nX-ray centroid by more than 8 kpc (i.e. 15 per cent) (but\nnone are offset by more than 15 kpc).\nWe can use the statistics of offset line emission of our\nsample to estimate the lifetime of such offsets. Assuming\n\n\f8\n\nHamer et al.\n\nthat all clusters with a line emitting BCG may experience\nan offset at some stage, the fraction of BCGs showing\nthis offset multiplied by the look-back time of the sample (\u223c1 Gyr at the median redshift of our sample) gives\nan estimate on the lifetime of \u223c40 Myr (3/77\u00d71 Gyr).\nWith IFU observations, it is also possible to estimate\nthe lifetime of the offset using the kinematics of the gas.\nAssuming the offset is orientated to the line of sight at\nan angle \u03b8, the actual separation of the BCG and X-ray\npeak is D = D\u2032 /sin\u03b8, where D is the actual separation\nand D' is the projected separation that we observe. Similarly the projected and actual velocity difference is given\nby V = V \u2032 /cos\u03b8. We can determine the timescale of this\nseparation to be T = D\u2032 /V \u2032 \u00d7 cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8.\nAssuming that the likelihood of any orientation is\nuniform over the area a hemisphere, then the median orientation angle will correspond to the angle that splits\nthe hemisphere into two equal areas. This implies that\n2\u03c0r3 cos\u03b82 = \u03c0r3 and hence \u03b8=cos\u22121 0.5 \u223c 60\u25e6 .\nA1991 has the most well constrained parameters of\nour three objects and therefore by setting a limit on the\noffset velocity and distance we can limit the range of angles over which we expect the offset to be orientated. We\nassume the maximum offset velocity to be 500 km s\u22121\nand the offset distance to be no more than 20 kpc. These\nvalues correspond to an orientation ranging from \u223c30\u25e6 \u2013\n75\u25e6 . By applying the above equation with appropriate\norientation angles we find that its most likely lifetime is\n45 Myr with a possible range of 20\u2013135 Myrs. These values are consistent with those calculated from the sample\nstatistics suggesting that the lifetime of such offsets is a\nfew tens to a hundred Myrs.\nAt a mass deposition rate of 10\u201320 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n(Sharma et al. 2004) 2 \u00d7 107 \u20132.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 could condense from the ICM within 20\u2013135 Myr. With our most\nlikely timescale of 45 Myr this corresponds to 5 \u00d7 108 \u2013\n109 M\u2299 so the expected mass of gas is comparable to our\ndetected CO gas mass. It should be noted that the lower\nmass deposition rate represents gas centred on the BCG\nwhich is at a higher temperature and lower density than\nthat at the offset position so should be considered a lower\nestimate.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe most striking result from our observations is that\nthe optical line emission is emitted predominantly from\nthe region with the highest soft X-ray surface brightness\nand not the BCG. In the vast majority of clusters the\npeak in the X-ray emission is very close to the BCG\n(Peres et al. 1998; Hudson et al. 2010; Sanderson et al.\n2009) so determining whether the optical lines are primarily related to the cooling of the ICM or the BCG\nis not possible. The direct relationship between the\ncore X-ray properties (e.g. cooling time or entropy)\nand the optical line emission in any BCG has been established (Rafferty et al. 2008; Cavagnolo et al. 2008).\nHowever, only in the very small minority of clusters\nwhere the 'sloshing' of the ICM resulting from major\nor minor cluster mergers (Ascasibar & Markevitch 2006;\nJohnson et al. 2010; Million et al. 2010) or an episode of\n\nstrong AGN activity temporarily results in the BCG not\nresiding at the peak of the gas cooling is there an opportunity to make the direct test of whether the optical line\nemission is related primarily with the cooling gas or the\nBCG itself.\nThe presence of cold molecular gas in the cores of\nclusters can be explained through a number of mechanisms: mergers with gas-rich cluster galaxies or gas cooling from the intracluster medium. The gas mass observed\nin BCGs (109\u221211.5 M\u2299 ) (Edge 2001; Salom\u00e9 & Combes\n2003) is too large to be explained by galaxy mergers or stellar mass loss but is consistent with heavily\nsuppressed cooling from the ICM (Peterson et al. 2003;\nPeterson & Fabian 2006; Sanders et al. 2010).\nGiven the close correlation between optical lines and\nCO found in other cluster cores the detection of ionised\ngas at the location of the X-ray peak suggests the presence of a reservoir of molecular gas offset from the BCG.\nIn A1991 and A3444 we directly detect the presence of\nmolecular gas in the form of CO. In one system, A1991\nwe also detect CO at the offset position, with a molecular\ngas mass of \u223c109 M\u2299 . The presence of such a high mass\nof molecular gas at the offset position clearly suggests\nthat cooling is occurring despite the BCG and cluster\ncore being separated.\nUsing the statistics from our sample we estimate\nthat any offset of greater than 8 kpc can only remain\nfor around 108 yrs. This is consistent with the dynamical\ntimescale of the core implying that these \"excursions\"\nof the BCG from the X-ray peak are short-lived. If the\nmolecular gas at the offset position is being produced\nin situ then it would have to cool from the ICM within\nthis time frame. Within the central regions of the cluster\ncore X-ray observations predict typical cooling rates of\nthe order \u223c 1-10 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Peterson & Fabian 2006), at\nthis rate of cooling the cluster core could deposit between\n108 and 109 M\u2299 of cold molecular gas in the \u223c 108 yrs\nwhich it is not coincident with the BCG. As such, the\noffset molecular gas observed in A1991 is consistent with\nthe upper band of cooling from the ICM of 25 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n(Sharma et al. 2004).\nAlthough A3444 and Ophiuchus do not have separate detections of cold molecular gas at the offset position, their similarities to A1991 suggest that it may be\npresent. Due to the smaller angular offset between BCG\nand X-ray peak in A3444 and Ophiuchus, resolving the\nmolecular gas is not possible with single dish observations. However, with the start of ALMA operations there\nis now the possibility to directly map the molecular gas\nin such systems allowing the separate components of the\ngas to be resolved.\nAn alternative explanation for the morphology of the\nextended molecular and ionised gas is ram pressure stripping of gas related to the BCG when a merger induces\nlarge motion of the ICM relative to the BCG. This requires an efficient mechanism to entrain the dense molecular gas into the much more tenuous ICM. The effect of\nmagnetic fields could enhance this stripping but would\nhave to be very effective to explain the acceleration observed in Ophiuchus. The observations presented here\ncannot rule out ram pressure stripping. However, future\nmm-interferometry should be able to map the cold molecc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fOffset optical line emission in cluster cores\nular gas and allow us to distinguish between these mechanisms. If ram pressure stripping is responsible we would\nexpect the molecular gas to be stripped less effectively\nthan the optical line-emitting gas, while in the case of\nlocal cooling we would expect a similar morphology between the two phases.\n\n5.1\n\nSimilar objects\n\nThe offset between the BCG and X-ray peak\nin clusters is not unique to these objects, both\nAbell 1644 (Johnson et al. 2010) and RXJ1347.51145 (Johnson et al. 2011) have a small offset and\nshow evidence of sloshing similar to that seen here.\nMarkevitch et al. (2003) also find that two thirds of clusters classified as cool cores by (Peres et al. 1998) show\nevidence of cold fronts associated with sloshing. An offset along the line of sight is not always obvious suggesting\nthe existence of more objects in which the BCG is dissociated from the cluster core but cannot be detected by\nobservations due to projection effects.\nThere are also a number of other systems where the\npeak of the line emission is coincident with the BCG but\nhave less intense offset line emission in the form of extended envelopes and filaments. A1795 (Crawford et al.\n2005) and RXJ0821+07 (Bayer-Kim et al. 2002) both\nshow very extended optical emission that follows the\nhighest X-ray emissivity in the cluster and also has associated cold molecular gas emission (Salom\u00e9 & Combes\n2004; Edge & Frayer 2003). Most recently, Canning et al.\n(2011) present evidence for a filament of optical line emission extending from the BCG in A2146 which is undergoing a major merger where the peak in the X-ray emission\nis offset from the BCG by 37 kpc. The IFU data presented in Canning et al. (2011) doesn't cover the X-ray\npeak so it can't be established if A2146 is similar to the\nthree clusters presented here but it illustrates that a significant merger is required to dissociate the BCG from\nthe X-ray peak. In a major merger the disruption in the\ncore will be significant. Russell et al. (2010) show that\nthe pressure profile in the core of A2146 is very asymmetric, unlike that in A1991 which is dynamically more\nquiescent. Therefore, the process of cluster-cluster merging, and the longer lived sloshing that it induces, may be\nrequired to produce the brief decoupling of the peak in\nthe intracluster medium density from the BCG observed\nin all of these systems.\nAnother viable mechanism for inducing bulk motion\nof the ICM in a cluster core is the inflation of cavities\ndue to AGN activity in the BCG. Blanton et al. (2011)\nshow a close correspondance between filaments of high Xray surface brightness and optical line emission in A2052\nwhich has an extensive cavity network. The compressed\ngas in these filaments has a short cooling time so the\noptical line emission may also be related to local cooling. The systems presented in this paper do not resemble\nA2052 or exhibit the large cavities required to generate\nthe observed offsets, so AGN feedback is unlikely to explain the lop-sided offsets we observe in A1991, A3444\nand Ophiuchus. However, the small scale correlation bec 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n9\n\ntween strongest X-ray cooling and optical line emission\nsuggests a common mechanism behind them.\nThe existence of cold gas that is 'orphaned' in the\ncores of clusters may have a number of implications for\nmore distant systems. For instance, in the high redshift\nradio galaxy TXS0828+193 (z = 2.6), Nesvadba et al.\n(2009) find a cloud of cold molecular gas emitting at\nCO(3-2) that has no bright optical or near-infrared counterpart that is 80 kpc from the radio galaxy itself. They\nspeculate that this may be analogous to low redshift clusters but note that the gas tends to be associated with\nthe central galaxy. While the total gas mass and physical\noffset are substantially larger in TXS0828+193 than in\nA1991 or A3444, the similarity between the systems may\npoint to a common mechanism.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWithin the cores of most clusters there is a clear spatial coincidence between the position of the BCG and\nthe peak of the ICM density. However there are a few\nclusters in which the BCG and cluster core are found to\nbe decoupled. In such systems, it is possible to disentangle the effects of the cluster core and the BCG on the\nICM and study each individually. Here we study three\nsuch systems selected from a parent sample of 77 massive X-ray selected clusters where we find that the optical, millimetre and X-ray observations of the cores show\nextended optical line emission and cold molecular gas directly related to the peak of the cooling of the intracluster\nmedium and not the central galaxy. These three systems\nare the only clusters from our sample to show a significant offset between the BCG and cluster core suggesting\nthat such a phenomenon is rare and transient. From our\nsample we find that a significant offset occurs in only 2\u2013\n3 per cent of systems and that they likely have lifetimes\nlasting of the order of 20\u2013100 Myr. We note however that\nit is possible for systems to have an offset along the line\nof sight which we would not detect so this fraction may\nbe slightly higher and should be considered a lower limit.\nThe rarity of such significant offsets between the\nBCG, X-ray peak and optical line emission points to\na large event in cluster evolution, a major cluster\nmerger or possibly a powerful AGN outburst. Mergers\nare predicted to drive shocks through the core of the\nICM at early times and cause sloshing as a later effect (Ascasibar & Markevitch 2006; Johnson et al. 2010;\nMillion et al. 2010; ZuHone et al. 2010; ZuHone 2011)\nboth of which are capable of separating the BCG from the\ncluster core. X-ray observations of A1991 suggest the passage of a cluster-wide shock through the core of the cluster and similar observations of Ophiuchus show sloshing\nof the ICM suggesting the possibility of a recent merger.\nWhatever the reason for the separation the gas cooling\nat the X-ray peak will continue and cooled gas will be\ndeposited away from the BCG. This provides a unique\nopportunity to directly constrain the process of gas cooling without the presence of a BCG.\n\n\f10\n\nHamer et al.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nSLH acknowledges the support received from an STFC\nstudentship.
