In contrast, in our recent analyses of the ASCA\ndata accumulated within r \u223c 3\u2032 -5\u2032 of the brightest ellipticals and groups we find that the Fe abundances are approximately solar and that the previous inferences of very\nsub-solar Fe abundances using ASCA data are the result\nof a bias arising from assuming the gas to be isothermal in\nthe presence of significant temperature gradients (Buote\n& Fabian 1998; Buote 1999, 2000a).\nTo investigate the possible role of Fe abundance gradients on these measurements we have re-examined the\nROSAT PSPC data of the brightest galaxies and groups.\nThe PSPC allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis\non a half-arcminute scale, and interesting constraints on\nboth the temperatures and Fe abundances are possible because the \u223c 1 keV temperatures of these systems are well\nmatched to the bandpass of the PSPC. Moreover, analysis\nof the PSPC data is much less subject to the \"Fe Bias\"\n(Buote, 2000a) which plagues analysis of the ASCA data\n(see \u00a75.1).\nWe selected for re-analysis all of the galaxies and groups\npossessing published temperature profiles from ROSAT\n(Forman et al 1993; Ponman & Bertram 1993; David et\nal 1994; Trinchieri et al 1994; Rangarajan et al 1995;\nKim & Fabbiano 1995; Irwin & Sarazin 1996; Jones et\nal 1997; Trinchieri, Fabbiano, & Kim 1997; Mulchaey &\nZabludoff 1998) with the exception of the Pegasus I group\n(Trinchieri et al, 1997) because of the low S/N. All of these\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOne important aspect of the problem of galaxy formation is to understand the connection between the history\nof star formation and the metal enrichment history of the\nextended hot gaseous component (e.g., Cavaliere, Giacconi, & Menci 2000). Recent studies have argued that\nmost of the metals produced by star-forming galaxies at\nhigh redshifts exist in the hot gaseous halos of galaxies\nand proto-clusters (e.g., Pettini 1999, 2000). By assuming\nthat the hot gaseous components of nearby rich clusters\nare a fair representation of the local universe as a whole,\nRenzini (1997, 2000) has argued that the cluster Fe abundances indicate a prompt initial enrichment of the early\nuniverse.\nHence, X-ray observations may be vital for obtaining a\ncomplete picture of the history of star formation of the\nuniverse In massive elliptical galaxies the metals injected\nby previous generations of stars do not escape the gravitational field, and thus the hot gas in these systems records\nthe star formation history via the heating and enrichment\nof the hot gas by supernovae (e.g., Ciotti et al 1991; David,\nForman, & Jones 1991; Loewenstein & Mathews 1991).\nThese systems typically fall into the class of cooling flows\n(e.g., Fabian 1994).\nUnfortunately, reliable constraints on the metal enrichment in such systems are lacking because the metal abundances in the hot gas in cooling flow galaxies and groups\ndetermined from previous X-ray studies have yielded conflicting results with most authors finding very sub-solar\nFe abundances (see Buote 2000a and references therein).\n1 Chandra\n\nFellow\n\n1\n\n\f2\nsystems have rising temperature profiles and multitemperature ASCA spectra usually attributed to cooling flows.\nAll but one of these ROSAT studies determined the temperatures and Fe abundances by fitting a single temperature component to the spectrum in an annulus on the sky.\nHowever, each annulus on the sky contains the projection\nof emission from larger radii which can confuse interpretation because of the substantial temperature gradients.\nConsequently, we have developed our own deprojection\ncode to obtain three-dimensional spectral parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we present the\nobservations and discuss the data reduction. The deprojection procedure is described in \u00a73 and the results for the\ntemperature and Fe abundance profiles are given in \u00a74.2;\nresults for the column densities appear in Buote (2000b,\nhereafter PAPER1; 2000c, hereafter PAPER3). Discussion of the results and our conclusions are presented in\n\u00a75.\n2. ROSAT OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nWe obtained ROSAT PSPC data from the public data\narchive maintained by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). The properties of the observations are listed in Table 1. Except where noted below, these data were reduced using the standard FTOOLS (v4.2) software according to\nthe procedures described in the OGIP Memo OGIP/94010 (\"ROSAT data analysis using xselect and ftools\"),\nthe WWW pages of the ROSAT Guest Observer Facility (GOF) (see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat),\nand Plucinsky et al (1993).\nThe events files of each observation were cleaned of afterpulse signals by removing all events following within 0.35\nms of a precursor. To minimize the particle background\ncontribution only events with Master Veto Rate less than\n170 ct s\u22121 were selected (Plucinsky et al, 1993). We corrected the Pulse Invariant (PI) bins of each data set for\nspatial and long-term temporal gain variations using the\nmost up-to-date calibration files. For the ftool pcecor,\nwhich corrects for the variation in the linearity of the\nPSPC response, we used the in-flight calibration data for\nthe correction.\nFrom visual inspection of the light curve of an observation we identified and removed time intervals of significant\nenhancements in the count rate in order to obtain a flat\ndistribution of count rate versus time. Such short-term enhancements are typically the result of scattered light from\nthe Sun, auroral X-rays, and enhanced charged particle\nprecipitation (Snowden et al, 1994). The raw and filtered\nexposure times are listed in Table 1.\nThe particle background spectrum for an observation\nwas obtained by following the instructions in Plucinsky et\nal (1993). We developed our own software to perform this\ntask because we identified serious errors in the ftools\nimplementation of the Plucinsky et al procedure (i.e., program pcparpha). For our data sets the particle background rate is alway much less than that of the diffuse\nbackground.\nFor each observation we obtained a background spectrum from source-free regions far away from the center of\nthe field (typically distances of 45\u2032 -50\u2032 ). By using a local\nbackground estimate residual contamination from solar Xrays and any other long-term background enhancements\n\n(Snowden et al, 1994) are fully accounted for in the ensuing spectral analysis. However, the extended emission of\nthe galaxies and groups do contribute at some level to the\nflux even at these large radii.\nTo assess the contribution of galaxy and group emission within the background regions we fit the background\nspectrum with a model after subtracting the particle background. We represent the cosmic X-ray background by a\npower law and the Galactic emission by two thermal components following Chen et al (1997). To account for emission from the galaxy or group we include another thermal\ncomponent with variable temperature. Each component is\nmodified by the Galactic hydrogen column listed in Table\n1.\nThis composite model provides a good fit to the background spectrum for each system. In every case the additional thermal component is required with temperatures\nranging from 0.3-1.6 keV. In 8 out of 10 cases this additional component contributes significantly only to energies above \u223c 0.5 keV which is consistent with emission\nfrom the galaxy or group in question. For these systems\nwe subtract this temperature component from the background when performing spectral analysis (see \u00a74.1.4), and\nthe background rates listed in Table 1 reflect this subtraction. The effect of excluding this extra component in the\nbackground on the source spectral parameters is only significant for a few systems, and is noticeable only in the\noutermost one or two radial bins (see \u00a74.3).\nFor NGC 5044 and 5846 we obtained T \u223c 0.3 keV for the\nextra thermal component and found that it contributed\nvery significantly to the emission in both the soft and hard\nenergy channels. In these cases the extra component probably represents a combination of emission from long-term\nenhancements in the background (Snowden et al, 1994)\nwith any residual emission from the groups. As a result,\nwe did not subtract out the extra thermal component from\nthe background of these systems.\nFor NGC 4472 we confirm the finding by Forman et\nal (1993) that a background spectrum taken from regions\n\u223c 40\u2032 -50\u2032 from the field center tends to over-subtract energies below \u223c 0.3 keV probably because of contamination\nfrom unresolved point sources. To compensate for this we\ntook the background from regions just inside the inner ring\nof the PSPC where the PSF is much smaller which allows\nus to avoid point sources more effectively. We confine the\nregion to the north of the center of NGC 4472 where the\ngalaxy emission is lower (Irwin & Sarazin, 1996).\n3. DEPROJECTION METHOD\n\nThe method we use to deproject the X-ray data is\nthe well-established technique pioneered by Fabian et al\n(1981). This method is non-parametric in that no functional form is assumed for the spatial distribution of the\nX-ray emission or for any of the associated spectral quantities (temperature, abundances etc.). After first assuming\na specific geometry one begins by determining the emission in the bounding annulus and then works inwards by\nsubtracting off the contributions from the outer annuli.\nFor the case of spherical symmetry the volume emission\ndensity is related to the surface brightness according to\nthe simple geometric formula given by Kriss, Cioffi, &\nCanizares (1983).\nThe assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is usually in-\n\n\f3\nTable 1\nROSAT Observations\nName\nNGC 507\n\nz\n0.01646\n\nNH\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n5.2\n\nNGC 533\nNGC 1399\nNGC 2563\n\n0.01810\n0.00483\n0.01630\n\n3.2\n1.3\n4.3\n\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\n\n0.00290\n0.00365\n0.00471\n0.00898\n0.00610\n\n1.7\n1.8\n2.2\n5.0\n4.2\n\n0.01460\n\n2.7\n\n4472\n4636\n4649\n5044\n5846\n\nHCG 62\n\nSequence No\n600254n00\n600254a01\n600541n00\n600043n00\n600542n00\n600542a01\n600248n00\n600016n00\n600017n00\n800020n00\n600257n00\n600257a01\n800098n00\n\nDate\n(Mo/yr)\n8/92\n1/93\n7/93\n8/91\n10/93\n4/94\n12/92\n12/91\n12/91\n7/91\n7/92\n1/93\n12/91\n\nExposure\n(ks)\n5.7/5.3\n15.3/12.6\n13.0/11.8\n53.5/18.7\n27.1/20.7\n22.9/20.6\n26.0/22.9\n13.1/6.3\n14.2/9.8\n27.7/19.4\n8.8/7.0\n5.9/3.9\n19.6/13.2\n\nSource Count Rate\n(ct s\u22121 )\n1.1E-1\n\nBackground\n(ct s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 )\n2.8E-4\n\n9.9E-2\n2.5E-1\n2.2E-2\n\n2.9E-4\n4.7E-4\n3.2E-4\n\n2.7E-1\n3.4E-1\n2.5E-1\n5.9E-1\n1.7E-1\n\n9.2E-4\n1.0E-3\n1.0E-3\n5.2E-4\n7.8E-4\n\n1.5E-1\n\n8.7E-4\n\nNote.-Redshifts are taken from NED. Galactic Hydrogen column densities (NH ) are taken from Dickey & Lockman (1990) using the\nHEASARC w3nh tool. The Exposure column lists first the raw exposure time and second the final filtered exposure (see \u00a72). The source count\nrate is computed within the central R = 1\u2032 . Both the source and background rates are computed over 0.2-2.2 keV. For systems with multiple\nobservations the source and background rates are computed from the total data.\n\ncorporated into this deprojection procedure in order to\nobtain the mass and mass deposition rate as well as the\nspectral parameters (Fabian et al 1981; Sarazin 1986; Arnaud 1988). In the interest of generality we do not make\nthis additional assumption. Hence, the principal assumption in our version of the deprojection procedure is that\nof spherical symmetry which means that our derived spectral parameters should be considered spherically averaged\nquantities for systems that have significant ellipticity.\nA thorough, up-to-date discussion of this deprojection\nmethod is given by McLaughlin (1999), and we refer the\nreader to that paper for the relevant equations. Since\nMcLaughlin is interested in the globular cluster distribution in M87 he formulates the deprojection algorithm in\nterms of the number of globular clusters, N (Ri\u22121 , Ri ), located between radii Ri\u22121 and Ri on the sky. To express his\nequations in terms of quantities relevant for X-ray analysis we simply associate N (Ri\u22121 , Ri ) with the X-ray flux,\nFx (Ri\u22121 , Ri ), in erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nWe have developed our own code to implement the\ndeprojection algorithm and have verified it using synthetic XMM data obtained by using the quicksim software (Snowden, 1999). Some aspects of the deprojection\nanalysis require special mention which we now address.\n3.1. Edge Effect\nThe deprojection algorithm assumes there is no source\nemission outside of the bounding annulus, Rm . This is\ngenerally not the case, and if the exterior emission is not\naccounted for then the volume emission density of the outermost annuli will be overestimated. Nulsen & B\u00f6hringer\n(1995) provide an analytic correction factor for the flux\nof the bounding annulus in the limit of annuli with zero\nwidth. Since, however, the width of the bounding annulus\ntends to be large because of decreasing S/N with increasing\nradius, and since any exterior emission also projects into\ninterior annuli, we follow McLaughlin (1999) and compute\na separate correction factor, f (Ri\u22121 , Ri ), for each annulus\narising from emission exterior to Rm .\nThe emissivity of this exterior emission projected into\nan annulus (Ri\u22121 , Ri ) is taken to be proportional to\n\nf (Ri\u22121 , Ri )Fx (Rm\u22121 , Rm ); i.e. the spectral shape of the\nemission exterior to Rm is assumed to be the same as\nthat for the outermost annulus. Moreover, to compute\nf (Ri\u22121 , Ri ) a model for the spatial profile for the exterior\nemission is required. We assume that the volume X-ray\nemission density is a power law outside of Rm which is\na good approximation for galaxies and groups since the\nX-ray emission at large radii is generally well described\nby a \u03b2 model (r\u22126\u03b2 ) with \u03b2 \u2248 0.5-0.7 (e.g., Mulchaey &\nZabludoff 1998). Our results are not very sensitive to these\nassumptions because our chosen bounding annuli are quite\nwide so that f \u226a 1 for \u03b2 over this range.\nThe formulae for f (Ri\u22121 , Ri ) for the cases \u03b2 = 1/2 and\n\u03b2 = 2/3 are given by equations A7 and A8 in McLaughlin\n(1999). All results presented in \u00a74 are for the case \u03b2 = 2/3\nsince, as mentioned above, the results are quite insensitive\nto this choice. Both the numerator and denominator of\nMcLaughlin's equation A8 evaluate to zero for Ri\u22121 = 0\nwhich is problematical for numerical computations. Fortunately, the limit is well-behaved, and in Appendix A we\ngive the limiting equation.\n3.2. Error Estimation\nThe deprojected X-ray emission in any annulus interior\nto the bounding annulus depends on the previous results\nobtained for adjacent exterior annuli. Since the deprojection procedure introduces correlations between annuli it\nis natural to employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate\nthe statistical uncertainties on the spectral parameters.\nHence, after we have obtained best-fitting models for all\ndesired annuli on the sky, we simulate a new data set for\neach annulus by using these models as templates. Then\nwe deproject these simulated data and obtain parameters\nin the same manner as done for the actual data.\nFor each observation we determine the errors on each parameter from 100 Monte Carlo simulations. In most cases\nwe found that the simulated parameters are reasonably\nsymmetrically distributed about a central peak. Consequently, we define confidence limits for a parameter with\nrespect to the median value from the 100 simulations. For\nexample, after sorting the 100 values for a given parameter\n\n\f4\ninto ascending order we define the 68% confidence limits\nto be given by the 16th and 84th values; the 90% limits\nare given by the 5th and 95th values, etc.\nThis scheme for defining confidence limits has its limitations. In some cases when the parameter has a large error\nthe simulated distribution is very flat so that the median\nis not obviously the best reference point from which to\ndefine confidence limits. In such instances the 68% confidence limits defined as above do not always enclose the\nbest-fitting value. However, we do find that in all cases\nthe best-fitting values are enclosed with the \u223c 90% confidence limits indicating that our definitions are not very\nunreasonable, and thus we apply the above definitions of\nconfidence levels in every case for consistency and convenience.\n3.3. Radial Parameter Fluctuations\nIt is well known from optical studies that the deprojection of the luminosity distribution of an elliptical galaxy\nyields a jagged profile where the departures from a smooth\nprofile are of the same magnitude or larger than the statistical errors on the photometry (e.g., Binney, Davies, &\nIllingworth 1990). A variety of factors contribute to the\nhigh-frequency noise responsible for the jagged profile such\nas the incomplete removal of point sources. An analogous\nsituation occurs for the deprojection of X-ray data.\nIn actuality the situation is worse for the X-ray case\nbecause one desires the profiles of several spectral parameters in addition to the luminosity, but the statistical noise\nis much greater while the ability to remove contaminating\nsources is usually much worse than in the optical. As a result, the radial fluctuations in parameter values can sometimes be sufficiently large so that the values get sent off to\nobscure regions of parameter space never to return. Such\nfluctuations do not agree with the parameters obtained\nfrom fitting the X-ray spectra without deprojection.\nOur preferred means to eliminate such fluctuations is to\nincrease the S/N by increasing the widths of the annuli.\nThis method is very effective and has the great advantage that no theoretical prejudice is forced onto the data\n(other than the desire for the 2D and 3D profiles to be\nqualitatively similar). Although doing this removes most\nof the serious parameter fluctuations in our ROSAT observations, in many cases there is still one annulus with\ndivergent parameter values.\nHence, to keep any remaining fluctuations in check we\nsmooth the derived parameter distributions in a manner\nrelated to linear regularization (e.g., Press et al 1992).\nThe problem with linear regularization is that one restricts\nthe point-to-point variation in the parameters with a preconceived model. For example, Finoguenov & Ponman\n(1999) assume the smooth profiles of the temperature and\nabundances to be linear functions of logarithmic radius.\n(The amount of smoothing applied also depends on an additional weighting factor \u2013 see Finoguenov & Ponman).\nHowever, as we show in \u00a75.2 these choices usually lead to\nvery biased parameter profiles.\nOur method of regularizing the parameters is not standard since we do not add an extra term to the \u03c72 equation\nbecause it cannot be done in the current version of xspec\n(Arnaud, 1996). Instead we perform an ex post facto regularization by simply restricting the available range for the\ntemperatures and Fe abundances at a given radius accord-\n\ning to the desired amount of smoothing. This method is\nsimpler to implement and, we believe, allows more transparent control over the smoothing process.\nTo insure that we do not over-smooth our parameter\nprofiles we do the following: (1) We always compare the\nresults obtained from analysis with and without deprojection and require that the two cases do not differ qualitatively. (2) We only regularize the temperatures and Fe\nabundances and always vary the amount of smoothing for\neach observation until we are satisfied that significant bias\nis not introduced. In most cases we found that restricting\nthe absolute values of the radial logarithmic derivatives in\nthe temperature and Fe abundance to be less than 1 and\n1.5 respectively worked well.\n3.4. \u03c72 Issues\nAll spectral fitting was performed with the software\npackage xspec (Arnaud, 1996) using the \u03c72 method implemented in its standard form. The weights for the \u03c72\nmethod are computed in each PI bin assuming gaussian\nstatistics. To insure that the weights are valid in this assumption we regrouped the PI bins for each source spectrum so that each group has at least 30 counts. The extraction of spectra is discussed in the following section.\nA possible concern with the interpretation of \u03c72 for\ngoodness-of-fit is that the deprojection procedure causes\nthe emission at inner radii to depend on that from larger\nradii. However, the model representing the projected emission within a given annulus is taken to be exact; i.e. statistical errors from the projected emission model are not\nincluded in the deprojection method, and therefore the\nstatistical errors in each PI bin remain those of the 2D annulus which are gaussian. We have verified the validity of\nusing \u03c72 for measuring goodness-of-fit under the standard\nassumption of gaussian statistics by comparing to results\nobtained from 2D analysis without deprojection: in all\ncases investigated we find that when a large improvement\nin \u03c72 is obtained from the deprojection analysis a qualitatively consistent large improvement is also obtained with\nthe 2D analysis.\n4. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS\n\n4.1. Preliminaries\n4.1.1. Extraction of Annular Spectra\nFor each system we extracted spectra in concentric\ncircular annuli located at the X-ray centroid (computed\nwithin a 2\u2032 radius) such that for each annulus the width\nwas \u2265 1\u2032 and the background-subtracted counts was larger\nthan some value chosen to minimize uncertainties on the\nspectral parameters for each system while maintaining as\nmany annuli as possible. Data with energies \u2264 0.2 keV\nwere excluded to insure that the PSF was < 1\u2032 FWHM.\nFor our on-axis sources \u223c 99% of the PSF at 0.2 keV is\ncontained within R = 1\u2032 (Hasinger et al, 1995).\nFor systems possessing more than one observation (see\nTable 1) we extracted the source and background spectra\nseparately from each observation and then added them\ntogether. In all such cases the observations occurred after the October 1991 gain change so the Redistribution\nMatrix File (RMF), which specifies the channel probability distribution for a photon, is the same for all of them.\nSince, however, the detector location of the annuli are in\n\n\f5\ngeneral slightly different for the different observations because of slight aspect differences, we averaged their respective Auxiliary Response Files (ARFs) which contain\nthe information on the effective area as a function of energy and detector location. Any background sources that\nwere identified by visual examination of the image were\nmasked out before the extraction.\n4.1.2. Models\nSince the X-ray emission of the galaxies and groups in\nour sample is dominated by hot gas, we use coronal plasma\nmodels as the basic component of our spectral models.\nWe use the MEKAL plasma code which is a modification of the original MEKA code (Mewe, Gronenschild, &\nvan den Oord 1985; Kaastra & Mewe 1993) where the\nFe L shell transitions crucial to the X-ray emission of ellipticals and groups have been re-calculated (Liedahl et.\nal, 1995); the superior performance of the MEKAL model\nover the Raymond-Smith code for spectral analysis of elliptical galaxies we have previously discussed in detail in\nBuote (1999). Because of the limited energy resolution\nof the PSPC, we focus on a \"single-phase\" description of\nthe X-ray emission in which a single temperature component exists at each (three-dimensional) radius. As we\ndiscuss below in \u00a75.1 we do not expect a significant \"Fe\nBias\" resulting from the single-phase analysis. We did\ninvestigate multiphase models of the hot gas such as a\ntwo-temperature plasma and a constant-pressure cooling\nflow (Johnstone et al, 1992), but interesting constraints\nwere not obtained as explained below in \u00a74.3; see \u00a73.1.1 of\nBuote (2000a) for further description of such models.\nWe account for absorption by our Galaxy using the\nphoto-electric absorption cross sections according to\nBaluci\u0144ska-Church & McCammon (1992).\nAlthough\nArabadjis & Bregman (1999) point out that the He cross\nsection at 0.15 keV is in error by 13%, since we analyze\nE > 0.2 keV we find that our fits do not change when\nusing the Morrison & McCammon (1983) cross sections\nwhich have the correct He value. The absorber is modeled\nas a uniform screen at zero redshift with solar abundances.\nThe hydrogen column density of the absorber is generally\nallowed to be a free parameter to indicate any additional\nabsorption due to, e.g., intrinsic absorbing material, calibration errors, etc. We refer to this as the standard absorber model. (In PAPER3 we discuss more complex absorption models.)\nAs discussed in PAPER1 and PAPER3 we also find\nit useful to consider absorption due to an oxygen edge\nwhich\nby the simple parameterization,\n\u0002 we represent\n\u0003\nexp \u2212\u03c4 (E/E0 )\u22123 for E \u2265 E0 , where E0 is the energy\nof the edge in the rest frame of the galaxy or group and \u03c4\nis the optical depth; i.e. \u03c4 represents an absorbing screen\nlocated at the source redshift but placed in front of the\nsource. Partial covering models are discussed in PAPER3.\nFinally, data with energies between 0.2 and 2.2 keV were\nincluded in the analysis.\n4.1.3. Meteoritic Solar Abundances\nIshimaru & Arimoto (1997) have pointed out that the\naccepted value for the solar Fe abundance relative to H is\napproximately 3.24 \u00d7 10\u22125 by number. This value is often\ncalled the meteoritic value since it was originally obtained\nfor meteorites, but it also agrees with recent measurements\n\nfrom the solar photosphere. This is to be contrasted with\nthe old photospheric value of Fe/H of 4.68 \u00d7 10\u22125 (Anders\n& Grevesse, 1989) that is widely used. We have decided\nto use the correct \"meteoritic\" Fe abundance for this and\nsubsequent papers; in xspec we use the abundance table\nof Feldman (1992). However, when comparing to previous\nresults we shall always take care to consider the factor of\n1.44 between the different Fe/H values.\nIron is the only abundance that we allow to be a free parameter. All other elemental abundances are tied to iron\nin their solar ratios; i.e. the values of the other abundances\nvary with Fe in their fixed solar ratios. In a sense we are\nactually fitting a metallicity, but since the Fe L-shell lines\ndominate all other lines in the PSPC spectrum for the\n\u223c 1 keV plasmas of bright galaxies and groups, the fitted\nmetallicity is almost entirely determined by Fe. Hence, we\nshall always quote our results as Fe abundances.\n4.1.4. Scaling the Background to the Source Position\nThe observed background spectrum obtained from regions far away from the source in general covers a different amount of detector area, requires a different detector\nresponse, and if taken from a different observation can\nhave a different exposure time. Within xspec the effect\nof different areas and exposure times for source and background are taken into account but not different detector\nresponses. Background spectra taken near the edge of the\nPSPC field suffer from vignetting which significantly reduces the count rate with respect to the source spectra\nnear the field center. This effect is also energy dependent,\nand thus the spectral shape of the background is altered\nas well.\nTo properly scale the background spectrum to the source\nposition we perform the following simple procedure. First,\nas explained in \u00a72 we fit a model to the background spectrum. Let us denote the flux of this model for an energy,\nE, by, FE (rb , Ab , tb ), where rb represents the detector position, Ab the background area on the detector, and tb ,\nthe exposure time. The corresponding flux in a given PI\nchannel, i, predicted by this model is then,\nX\nFi (rb , Ab , tb ) =\nFE (rb , Ab , tb )RMFEi (rb )ARFE (rb ).\nE\n\nThe model, FE , is independent of the response, and thus\nthe expected background flux in channel, i, at the source\nposition is simply,\nFi (rs , As , ts ) =\n\u0013\nX\u0012\nAs ts\nFE (rb , Ab , tb )\nRMFEi (rs )ARFE (rs ), (1)\nAb tb\nE\n\nwhere rs , As , and ts are respectively the position, area,\nand exposure time for the source.\nIn the general case one would prefer to use the actual\nbackground data rather than a best-guess model. To do\nthis simply scale the real background spectrum by the factors Fi (rs , As , ts )/Fi (rb , Ab , tb ) for each PI channel. These\nratios are typically very insensitive to the detailed shape\nof the input model spectrum.\nThis scaling procedure was followed for NGC 5044 and\n5846. For the other systems we needed to subtract a thermal component due to the extended source emission as\n\n\f6\ndiscussed in \u00a71. Since for these systems the background\nestimate is necessarily defined by a model we used equation (1) for the scaling.\n4.2. Results\nWe plot in Figures 1-4 the temperature and Fe abundance profiles obtained from the deprojection analysis according to the number of annuli for which useful constraints on the parameters were obtained. This categorizes the systems essentially according to the S/N of the\ndata. Fe abundance profiles are shown for the cases where\nthe column density of the standard absorber was (1) fixed\nat the Galactic value and (2) treated as a free parameter.\n(The temperature profiles are very similar in each case,\nand thus for clarity of presentation we show only the case\nfor fixed Galactic column density.) For both the temperature and Fe abundance profiles we also show the results\nobtained with and without an extra oxygen edge at 0.532\nkeV (rest frame). The profiles of column density and edge\noptical depth are given in PAPER1 for NGC 1399 and\n5044 and in PAPER3 for all the systems.\nThe deprojected temperature profiles are all very similar to the 2D profiles obtained in many previous studies\nwith the ROSAT PSPC (Forman et al 1993; Ponman &\nBertram 1993; David et al 1994; Trinchieri et al 1994; Rangarajan et al 1995; Kim & Fabbiano 1995; Irwin & Sarazin\n1996; Jones et al 1997; Trinchieri et al 1997; Mulchaey &\nZabludoff 1998; Buote 1999). As expected, our 3D profiles display a slightly steeper rise from the central minimum to the maximum at r \u223c 50-100 Mpc in very good\nagreement with the 3D profiles obtained by Finoguenov\nand co-workers for several systems using both ROSAT and\nASCA data (Finoguenov et al 1999; Finoguenov & Ponman 1999; Finoguenov & Jones 2000). The temperature\nprofiles also agree very well with two-temperature models\nof ASCA data (Buote 1999, 2000a).\nThe models with an oxygen edge tend to have lower\ntemperatures at small radii. This can occur because lower\ntemperature gas produces stronger oxygen lines which are\nabsorbed by the oxygen edge. Although in most cases\nboth models give fits of similar quality, the edge model\nprovides a significantly better fit for some of the systems\n(see PAPER1 and PAPER3).\nFor the four systems with the highest S/N data in our\nsample (NGC 507, 1399, 4472, and 5044) the Fe abundance profiles obtained from models (without an oxygen\nedge) where the column density is treated as a free parameter are very much larger than for all models with fixed\nGalactic column density. Even after accounting for the differences between meteoritic and photospheric solar abundances, the Fe abundances implied by these models greatly\nexceed and are very inconsistent with the Fe abundances\nobtained from all ASCA studies. They are, however, consistent with previous ROSAT studies where the column\ndensity was treated as a free parameter (e.g., Forman et\nal 1993; David et al 1994).\nFor these systems the models with variable column density give Fe abundances that increase rapidly with decreasing radius, but the column densities (except for NGC 507)\nalso decrease well below the Galactic values as r \u2192 0 (PAPER1 and PAPER3). Since the column densities at large\nradii are consistent with the Galactic values this decrease\nat small radii cannot be due to errors in the background\n\nsubtraction. Rather, the sub-Galactic columns and huge\nFe abundances that are inconsistent with ASCA signals\nsome inadequacy in the emission model. As it turns out\n(see Figures 1-4) except for NGC 5044 the variable-column\ndensity models with an oxygen edge give Fe abundances\n(and columns) that are very consistent with the fixedcolumn models. This gives additional support for the edge\nmodel discussed in PAPER1 and PAPER3 (though see\n\u00a75.3 of PAPER3).\nIn most of the other systems the variable-columndensity models also tend to predict sub-Galactic columns\nat small radii though at much lower significance. These\nsub-Galactic columns are also accompanied by systematically larger Fe abundances than the fixed-Galactic case,\nthough again the edge models usually give consistent abundances for the free- and fixed-column density cases. Hence,\nthe Fe abundance profiles which typically agree best with\nprevious ASCA analyses are those obtained from models\nwith fixed Galactic column density (with or without an\nedge), though variable column models with an oxygen edge\nyield comparable results in most cases. Since, however, the\nevidence for intrinsic oxygen absorption is strong for half\nof these systems (PAPER1 and PAPER3) we believe the\nmodels with an intrinsic oxygen edge and a standard absorber with NH = NHGal to be the most physical of the\nmodels investigated (i.e. crosses and dotted diamonds in\nmiddle column of Figures 1 - 4).\nFrom inspection of Figures 1-4 it is readily apparent that\nmost of the systems have Fe abundance profiles that decrease as a function of radius. Typically within r \u223c 10 kpc\nthe Fe abundance ranges from ZFe \u2248 1Z\u2299 \u2212 (several)Z\u2299\nand decreases to ZFe \u223c 0.5Z\u2299 for r \u223c 50 \u2212 100 kpc. We\nnow discuss the individual systems in groups defined by\nthe total number of annuli with interesting constraints.\nWhen comparing our Fe abundances to previous studies\nwe implicitly account for projection effects and the different plasma codes and solar abundances used (\u00a74.1.3).\n4.2.1. Systems with 7 Annuli\nIn Figure 1 we display the results for the three systems where the spectral parameters are well determined\nin seven annuli. These observations thus generally correspond to the highest S/N data in our sample. In each case\nthe models with an oxygen edge exhibit significant negative Fe abundance gradient, though in NGC 1399 the key\nevidence occurs in the central radial bin.\nNGC 507: The evidence for a Fe abundance gradient is\nstrong as is the large value in the central bin: 95% confidence lower limits are 1.3Z\u2299 and 1.1Z\u2299 respectively for\nmodels with and without an oxygen edge (column density fixed at Galactic). The average Fe abundance within\nr = 4\u2032 is \u2248 1Z\u2299 in excellent agreement with the value obtained by Buote & Fabian (1998) from a two-temperature\nmodel of the ASCA data. Our Fe abundance profile also\nagrees reasonably well with the 2D profile obtained in the\nprevious ROSAT study by Kim & Fabbiano (1995).\nNGC 1399: The Fe abundance profile is constant for\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nr >\n\u223c 3 , rises slightly for r \u2248 1 -2 , and in the center has\ndifferent values depending on the model. As shown in\nPAPER1 and PAPER3 the edge model is strongly preferred, and thus the Fe abundance is consistent with being\nlargest at the center; note that even though the error esti-\n\n\f7\n\nNGC 507\n\nNGC 1399\n\nNGC 5044\n\nFig. 1.- Results of the deprojection analysis for the systems where interesting constraints were obtained in 7 annuli.

Our Fe\nabundance profile for the case of variable column density\n\nand no edge agrees very well with the 2D profile of Jones\net al (1997).\nNGC 5044: Again there is clear evidence that the\nFe abundance profile is not constant with radius. As\nnoted earlier the models with variable column density\npredict large Fe abundances that are inconsistent with\nASCA studies. (But they are consistent with the previous ROSAT study of David et al 1994.) For example,\n\n\f8\n\nNGC 2563\n\nNGC 4472\n\nNGC 5846\n\nFig. 2.- As Figure 1 but for systems with 5 or 6 annuli.\n\nBuote (1999) obtains ZFe \u2248 0.9Z\u2299 within r \u2248 5\u2032 for a twotemperature model of the ASCA data. Since in PAPER1\nand PAPER3 we also find that an oxygen edge is clearly\nrequired in the central regions, let us focus on the Fe abundance profile obtained from a model with an edge and\nwith fixed Galactic column density. This model yields a\n\u2032\nFe abundance of ZFe \u223c 0.7Z\u2299 for r >\n\u223c 3 and ZFe \u223c 1.5Z\u2299\nfor smaller r.\n4.2.2. Systems with 5-6 Annuli\nThe results for systems having 5 or 6 annuli are plotted\nin Figure 2. Evidence for a negative Fe abundance gradient is clear for NGC 4472, marginal for NGC 5846, and\n\nnon-existent for NGC 2563.\nNGC 2563: Independent of the model it is clear that\nthe Fe abundance is constant with radius with a value of\n\u223c 2.0Z\u2299 when the column density is treated as a free parameter as opposed to \u223c 1.5Z\u2299 for fixed Galactic column\ndensity. These results are consistent with the Fe abundance determined within r \u2248 3\u2032 by Buote (2000a) from a\ntwo-temperature model of the ASCA data.\nNGC 4472: Analogously to NGC 5044 the Fe abundances obtained for the model with variable column density and no edge are very large and very inconsistent with\nall previous ASCA measurements. Also similar to NGC\n5044 is that the edge model is strongly preferred (see PA-\n\n\f9\n\nNGC 533\n\nNGC 4636\n\nHCG 62\n\nFig. 3.- As Figure 1 but for systems with 4 annuli.\n\n\u2032\nPER3). The edge models give ZFe <\n\u223c 1Z\u2299 for r > 3 and\nZFe \u223c 2Z\u2299 \u2212 3Z\u2299 at smaller radii. These values are in\nexcellent agreement with those obtained from previous 2D\nstudies with ROSAT (Forman et al 1993; Irwin & Sarazin\n1996). These Fe abundances also agree very well with the\nvalue obtained by Buote (1999) from a two-temperature\nmodel of the ASCA data.\nNGC 5846: The models with variable column density\nshow clear evidence for a negative Fe abundance gradient,\nbut since the column densities obtained within the inner\ntwo bins are sub-Galactic we do not consider these models\nto be physical (\u00a75.3 of PAPER3). The models with fixed\nGalactic column density with and without an edge give\n\nvery similar profiles except that in the central bin the upper limit on the Fe abundance for the edge model is not\nvery well determined. These fixed-column models suggest\na negative gradient in Fe abundance, but the errors are\nsufficiently large so that a constant profile is not clearly\nexcluded. These Fe abundances also agree very well with\nthe values obtained by Buote (2000a) from multitemperature models of the ASCA data.\n4.2.3. Systems with 4 Annuli\nThe galaxies and groups for which we obtained useful\nconstraints in four radial bins are shown in Figure 3. Although the data sets for these systems have lower S/N\n\n\f10\n\nNGC 4649\n\nFig. 4.- As Figure 1 but for the one system with 3 annuli.\n\nthan the previous examples, the evidence for negative Fe\nabundance gradients is as strong or stronger than the others.\n\u2032\nNGC 533: All models give ZFe \u223c 0.5Z\u2299 for r >\n\u223c 3 and\n\u2032\nZFe >\n\u223c 1Z\u2299 within 1 . These Fe abundances are consistent with the results for multitemperature models obtained\nwith ASCA within r = 3\u2032 by Buote (2000a).\nNGC 4636: In the outer bin all models give a very\nsub-solar value for the Fe abundance, ZFe \u223c 0.4Z\u2299 .\nThe Fe abundance rises with decreasing radius such that\nZFe >\n\u223c 1Z\u2299 in the central bin. These results are consistent\nwith those obtained by Buote (1999) for multitemperature\nmodels of ASCA data analyzed within r = 5\u2032 .\nHCG 62: Similar to NGC 4636, all models give a very\nsub-solar value for the Fe abundance, ZFe \u223c 0.2Z\u2299 , in\nthe outer bin. The Fe abundance rises very sharply with\nincreasing radius such that ZFe >\n\u223c 2Z\u2299 in the central\nbin. This system appears to possess the most significant Fe abundance gradient in our sample: the 95% lower\nlimits on the values in the central bin are 4.6Z\u2299 and\n3.2Z\u2299 respectively for models with and without an edge\n(both with column density fixed to Galactic). The Fe\nabundance of \u223c 1.4Z\u2299 obtained by Buote (2000a) using\na two-temperature model of the ASCA data accumulated\nwithin r = 3\u2032 is consistent with our ROSAT results provided the Fe abundance in the central bin is near the estimated 1\u03c3 lower limits.\n\n4.2.4. Systems with 3 Annuli\nFinally, in Figure 4 we show the results for the galaxy\nwith the smallest number of annuli, NGC 4649. Similar to the 4-annuli objects, NGC 4649 is one of the most\nsignificant examples for a decrease in Fe abundance with\nincreasing radius.\nNGC 4649: For this system the edge model is clearly\npreferred (see PAPER3), though the Fe abundances are\nfairly similar for all of the models. In the outer bin\nZFe \u223c 0.25Z\u2299 for all models and rises to ZFe >\n\u223c 1.5 within\nthe central bin for the edge models. Buote & Fabian\n(1998) obtained a Fe abundance of \u223c 1.3Z\u2299 from a twotemperature model of the ASCA data within r = 3\u2032 in\ngood agreement with our ROSAT results.\n\n4.3. Caveats\n(i) Spherical Symmetry: The X-ray isophotes of most of\nthe systems are approximately circular over the regions\nexamined. Notable exceptions are NGC 1399 and 4472\nwhich show significant deviations from circular symmetry\n\u2032\nat large radius. For R >\n\u223c 5 there is a significant N-S asymmetry in the X-ray surface brightness of NGC 1399 which\nJones et al (1997) hypothesize is due to incomplete relaxation of the gas in the surrounding group. In contrast,\n\u2032\noutside of R >\n\u223c 3 the X-ray isophotes of NGC 4472 flatten\nwhich Irwin & Sarazin (1996) attribute to ram pressure as\nthe galaxy moves with respect to the Virgo cluster. Our\nresults for these systems at large radii average over these\nasymmetries. It is worth remarking that although these\nsystems have larger than solar Fe abundances at their centers, we find that at the largest radii ZFe \u223c 0.75Z\u2299 for\nNGC 1399 and ZFe \u223c 0.3Z\u2299 for NGC 4472; i.e. it is plausible that the small value for NGC 4472 is significantly\ninfluenced by the ambient gas of the Virgo cluster.\n(ii) Single-Phase Gas: We have focused on single-phase\nanalysis of the hot gas because in no case did we find that\nmultiphase models of the hot gas improved the fits significantly. In the central bins of most of the systems we\nexpect gas to be emitting over a range of temperatures\nbecause of the observed temperature gradients. However,\ndeprojection has removed the high-temperature gas components from the centers leaving a much smaller temperature range (typically a few tenths of a keV) which cannot\nbe distinguished by the limited energy resolution of the\nPSPC. (Note that even if gas is dropping out of a cooling flow, emission weighted temperatures are within 50%\nof the ambient value \u2013 e.g., Buote, Canizares, & Fabian\n1999). These small temperature ranges also indicate that\nthe \"Fe Bias\" should be unimportant (see appendix of\nBuote 2000a), and thus multitemperature models do not\ngive qualitatively different Fe abundances in the central\nbins \u2013 see also \u00a75.1.\n(iii) Background Issues: There are two backgrounds which\nmust be considered. First, the edge effect described in \u00a73.1\nrequires one to assume a model for the emission outside\nof the bounding annulus. We never found any noticeable\neffect on the derived temperatures and abundances for reasonable choices of \u03b2. Only the electron density is affected\nand only for the outermost annuli. Second, we examined\n\n\f11\nthe effects of taking background estimates from different\nparts of the detector and from different fields nearby to\na given object. We found that in most cases when the\nbackground level was over-estimated the Fe abundances\ntended to be larger than when the background was underestimated. The size of the effect depends on many factors (e.g., S/N) though again we found that for reasonable\nbackground choices only the outermost annuli are affected\nas would be expected. (Of course such effects will propagate to smaller radii if the regularization criteria are not\napplied with care \u2013 see below.)\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nDeprojection analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data of 10\ncooling flow galaxies and groups reveals clear evidence\nfor Fe abundances that decrease with radius in all but\none system (NGC 2563). Typically ZFe \u223c 0.5Z\u2299 at the\nlargest radii examined (r \u223c 50-100 kpc) which increases\nto ZFe \u2248 1Z\u2299 \u2212 (several)Z\u2299 within the central radial bin\n(r <\n\u223c 10 kpc). In most cases the estimated uncertainties on ZFe are large within the central bin and allow for\nZFe \u226b 1Z\u2299 (but never ZFe \u226a 1Z\u2299 ). Throughout this paper we have used the \"meteoritic\" solar abundances (Fe/H\nis 3.24 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u2013 see Ishimaru & Arimoto 1997) which leads\nto Fe abundances that are a factor of 1.44 larger than previous studies that used the old \"photospheric\" solar value\nfor Fe (see \u00a74.1.3).\nThese 3D Fe abundance profiles are generally consistent with the original 2D ROSAT studies (Forman et al.\n1993; David et al 1994; Kim & Fabbiano 1995; Irwin &\nSarazin 1996; Jones et al 1997) after accounting for projection effects and for the different plasma codes and solar\nabundances used (though see below in \u00a75.1). For all 10\nsystems the Fe abundances (and temperatures) that we\nhave obtained from the deprojected ROSAT data agree\nwith those we have obtained previously from analysis of\nthe ASCA data accumulated within r \u223c 3\u2032 -5\u2032 (Buote &\nFabian 1998; Buote 1999, 2000a); qualitatively similar results for some of these systems also have been recently\nobtained with ASCA data by Allen, Di Matteo, & Fabian\n(2000).\nTherefore, within r \u223c 50 kpc of these bright galaxies\nand groups the ROSAT and ASCA data clearly demonstrate that the gas is non-isothermal with approximately\nsolar Fe abundances. We now examine whether it is the\nassumption of isothermality or the presence of Fe abundance gradients which accounts for the very sub-solar Fe\nabundances inferred by most previous ASCA (and some\nROSAT ) studies (see Buote 2000a for a detailed review).\n5.1. Fe Bias vs Fe Gradients\nPreviously we have discussed how fitting a singletemperature plasma model to the soft X-ray spectrum\nof a bright elliptical galaxy or galaxy group that actually consists of multiple temperature components can lead\nto a serious underestimate of the Fe abundance (Buote\n& Canizares 1994; Buote & Fabian 1998; Buote 1999,\n2000a). In our most comprehensive treatment to date\n(Buote, 2000a) we provided a physical explanation of this\n\"Fe Bias\" from examination of ASCA data which we now\nsummarize in Figure 5.\nThe accumulated ASCA spectra within r \u223c 3\u2032 -5\u2032 of the\nbrightest elliptical galaxies and groups (including those\n\nin our present investigation) are well represented by twotemperature (2T) models. These 2T models are also consistent with the radial temperature gradients inferred from\nthe ROSAT data within the same spatial regions (Buote\n1999, 2000a). Moreover, we have verified that such 2T\nmodels continue to provide a good representation of the\naccumulated spectra generated by the ROSAT temperature profiles out to the largest radii (\u223c 15\u2032 ) investigated\nin our present paper whether or not the temperature rises\nand then falls (e.g., NGC 2563 \u2013 Figure 2) or continues\nto rise out to the largest radii (e.g., NGC 4472 \u2013 Figure\n2). This agreement is expected because a 2T model can\nmimic very accurately the soft X-ray spectra of cooling\nflows (Buote et al, 1999).\nIn Figure 5 we show a simulated ASCA SIS spectrum\nof a 2T model with ZFe = 1Z\u2299 with temperatures and\nrelative emission measures typical of the bright galaxies\nand groups. For this discussion we consider only the energies 0.55-1.5 keV to emphasize the Fe L lines and the\nlower bandpass limit of the SIS. Also shown in Figure 5 is\nthe result of fitting a single-temperature (1T) model with\nZFe fixed at 1Z\u2299 to the simulated 2T spectral data. It\nis readily apparent that the 1T model is a poor fit to the\n2T spectrum as it is too peaked near 1 keV while being\ndeficient in emission at other energies. This behavior simply reflects the ability of the 2T model to excite Fe L lines\nover a wider range of energies than the 1T model. In order\nto force the 1T model to better fit the 2T spectrum one\nhas to reduce the size of the peak at 1 keV which means\nreducing the Fe abundance. Allowing ZFe to be a free parameter results in a better (but still not good) fit and with\na best-fitting value of ZFe = 0.3Z\u2299 (see Figure 5.1). It is\nthis effect that we have termed the \"Fe Bias\".\nThis Fe Bias is dependent on the energy resolution of\nthe detector and is more pronounced at higher resolution\nwhich is why we have focused on the ASCA SIS data.\nBut if the models in Figure 5.1 are folded with the relatively low resolution of the ROSAT PSPC we obtain a\nbest-fitting value of ZFe = 0.4Z\u2299 for the 1T model, very\nsimilar to that obtained above at higher resolution with\nthe SIS. However, it must be emphasized that this underestimate with the PSPC is achieved only if the lower limit\non the bandpass is restricted to energies >\n\u223c 0.6 keV as appropriate for the SIS. If instead the lower energy limit is\nreduced to 0.2 keV as is appropriate for the PSPC then\nwe obtain ZFe \u2248 0.6 \u2212 0.7Z\u2299 for the 1T model.\nThis smaller underestimate occurs because while reducing the Fe abundance diminishes the line emission of the\n1T model to better fit the spectral maximum near 1 keV,\nthe continuum of the 1T model must increase to compensate for the decrease in the Fe L emission at energies near\n\u223c 0.8, 1.2 keV. It also compensates for the corresponding\ndecrease in the strong O K\u03b1 emission near 0.6 keV since\nO (like the other elements) varies with Fe in its solar ratio\n(see \u00a74.1.3).\nThis raising of the continuum by the 1T model generally\ngoes unnoticed when analyzing ASCA data for the following reason. The ASCA SIS and GIS bandpasses do not\nextend below the energy regions shown in Figure 5, but\nthey do include energies up to \u223c 10 keV. However, the\nemission at higher energies is usually accounted for by introducing an additional high-temperature bremsstrahlung\ncomponent (BREM) to represent emission from discrete\n\n\f12\n\nFig. 5.- (Left) Simulated ASCA SIS spectrum of a two-temperature plasma (T1 = 0.75 keV, T2 = 1.5 keV with equal emission measures\nfor each temperature component) with ZFe = 1Z\u2299 (crosses) and the best-fitting single-temperature model (solid line) also with ZFe fixed at\n1Z\u2299 . (Right) Same but the Fe abundance of the single-temperature model is allowed to vary resulting in a best-fitting value of ZFe = 0.3Z\u2299 .\n\nsources (e.g., Matsumoto et al. 1997), and thus any increase or decrease in the emission of the 1T model at\nenergies much larger than 1 keV can be compensated by\nchanging the normalization of the BREM component. The\nrequired amount of compensation is generally unimportant because the emission from the 1T model decreases\nas exp(\u2212E/T ), and thus a plasma with T \u2248 1 keV contributes little to the emission of a 1T+BREM model at\nhigher energies.\nHowever, spectral analysis with PSPC data includes\nlower energies (i.e. \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5 keV) that are dominated\nby continuum emission. The data at these energies restrict\nthe attempt by the data near 1 keV to simultaneously reduce the Fe abundance and increase the continuum in order to force a better fit of a 1T model to the 2T spectrum.\nHence, the Fe Bias affecting analysis of PSPC data is much\nless pronounced than for ASCA data because of the lower\nenergy resolution of the PSPC, and especially because the\nPSPC data include energies below \u223c 0.5 keV.\nOur deprojection analysis of the PSPC data removes\nthe temperature components projected from larger radii\nfrom the spectrum of a given annulus. Consequently, if the\ngas is single-phase (i.e., a single density and temperature\nat each radius) the range of temperatures within a given\nannular spectrum must be small after deprojection (i.e.,\nessentially the temperature difference between the annuli\nthat surround the annulus in question). Since each deprojected spectrum is nearly isothermal, and since the Fe Bias\nis already greatly reduced when analyzing PSPC data, we\nexpect that the Fe Bias does not significantly affect our\nmeasurements of the Fe abundances from the PSPC data\nin this paper. It is therefore not surprising that the Fe\nabundances we have obtained from our deprojection analysis of the PSPC data agree only with those obtained from\nthe ASCA studies that have removed the Fe bias by fitting\nmultitemperature models of the ASCA spectra accumulated within substantial spatial regions (r \u223c 3\u2032 \u2212 5\u2032 ; Buote\n& Fabian 1998; Buote 1999, 2000a; Allen et al 2000).\nIf a warm gas phase (T = 105 \u2212 106 K) also contributes\nto the X-ray emission of the galaxies and groups as indi-\n\ncated by the intrinsic absorption reported in PAPER1 and\nPAPER3, then the single-phase assumption needs to be\nreconsidered. However, the low temperature of the warm\ngas implies a negligible contribution to the Fe L emission\nand thus will not contribute to an Fe Bias. Another possibility is that the hot gas emits over a continuous range\nof temperatures as might be expected from an inhomogeneous cooling flow that cools at constant pressure (e.g.,\nJohnstone et al 1992). As mentioned in \u00a74.3 we do not\nfind any significant change in the inferred Fe abundances\nif we use such a cooling flow model.\nIf the Fe Bias is not very important for analysis of\nROSAT PSPC data, then why do some ROSAT studies\nfind very low Fe abundances? As stated above the Fe abundances we have determined from the deprojection analysis\nof the PSPC data of the 10 galaxies and groups in our\nsample agree very well with those obtained from previous\nspatial-spectral analyses of these systems with the PSPC\nafter accounting for (1) the factor of 1.44 arising from our\nuse of the meteoritic solar abundances, (2) different plasma\ncodes used, and (3) small differences associated with our\nuse of a deprojection analysis (Forman et al. 1993; David\net al 1994; Kim & Fabbiano 1995; Irwin & Sarazin 1996;\nJones et al 1997).\nOur results also agree with those of Helsdon & Ponman\n(2000) who fitted 1T models within large apertures (typically 20\u2032 radius) for several groups including NGC 533,\n2563, 4636, and 5846. To make a more realistic comparison we summed up the emission models we obtained for\nall annuli for these systems, simulated a PSPC observation using the same exposure time, and then fitted the\nsimulated spectrum with a 1T model like Helsdon & Ponman. The Fe abundances we obtained from this exercise\nare fully consistent within the 2\u03c3 errors for each system.\nWe emphasize that Helsdon & Ponman find ZFe >\n\u223c 0.6Z\u2299\n(scaled to meteoritic solar) for these systems even when\nusing very large apertures.\nIn contrast Mulchaey & Zabludoff (1998) obtain ZFe <\n\u223c\n0.2Z\u2299 from 1T (Raymond-Smith) fits to the PSPC spectra of NGC 2563, HCG 62, and NGC 5846 within radii\n\n\f13\nof \u223c 20\u2032 (though ZFe \u223c 0.6Z\u2299 is obtained for NGC 533).\nThe values for NGC 2563 and 5846 obtained by Mulchaey\n& Zabludoff are inconsistent with those obtained from the\nvery similar analysis by Helsdon & Ponman (2000) and\nfrom our deprojection analysis.\nA possible explanation could be associated with the\nbackground subtraction. As we noted in \u00a74.3 the Fe abundances will be underestimated if the background is also\nunderestimated. This effect is only noticeable when the\nbackground is underestimated by factors or \u223c 2 or more.\nSuch a large factor will result if the background spectrum\nis taken from the edge of the field and not corrected for\nvignetting before subtracting from a source region near\nthe center of the field. As explained in \u00a74.1.4 we always\naccount for the different detector responses for the source\nand background in our analysis.\nHowever, when ignoring the response differences we are\nable to reproduce the very small Fe abundances obtained\nby Mulchaey & Zabludoff for NGC 2563, 5846, and HCG\n62. (We perform the 1T fits in the same manner as described above for our comparison to the results of Helsdon\n& Ponman; i.e. we include all of the annuli investigated.)\nOur value for NGC 533 is consistent within the large statistical error with that obtained by Mulchaey & Zabludoff\nwhether or not we properly scale the background to the\nsource positions. Since the Fe abundances that we have\ndetermined from the PSPC data agree with all other previous ROSAT studies except Mulchaey & Zabludoff, we\nare lead to conclude that they must not have corrected\ntheir background spectra for vignetting before subtracting\nfrom the source spectra.\nHence, there is no evidence from the ROSAT PSPC data\nthat the brightest elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups\nhave average Fe abundances that are very sub-solar \u2013 regardless of whether they have steep Fe abundance gradients. The only clear evidence for very sub-solar Fe abundances is thus derived from fits to the ASCA data assuming an isothermal gas which we have shown to give\nmisleading results because of the Fe bias. Thus, it is the\nassumption of isothermality, rather than the presence of Fe\nabundance gradients, which accounts for the very sub-solar\nFe abundances inferred by most previous ASCA studies\n(see Buote 2000a for a detailed review).\n5.2. Low Fe Abundance as the Result of Over-Smoothing\nThe consistent picture that we have described is not\nsupported by the work of Finoguenov and co-workers who\nfind very sub-solar Fe abundances from deprojection analysis of the ASCA data of HCG 62, NGC 4472, 4636, 4649,\n5044, and 5846 (Finoguenov et al 1999; Finoguenov & Ponman 1999; Finoguenov & Jones 1999). For HCG 62 and\nNGC 5044 Finoguenov & Ponman (1999) also perform a\ndeprojection of the ROSAT data and obtain results not too\ndissimilar from their ASCA analysis. As noted before in\n\u00a74.2 we emphasize that our temperature profiles for these\nsystems agree well with those obtained in the Finoguenov\npapers.\nWe have previously speculated on possible reasons for\nthe different Fe abundances obtained by Finoguenov (see\n\u00a74.1 of Buote 2000a). Now equipped with our own deprojection code we can test one of those speculations: the regularization assumptions. As discussed in \u00a73.3 Finoguenov\n& Ponman (1999) require that the temperatures and abun-\n\ndances vary approximately logarithmically with radius.\nHowever, we have shown that most of these systems,\nespecially HGC 62, have steep Fe abundance gradients\nand thus these regularization criteria must be carefully\nchecked.\nIn Figure 6 we plot the radial profiles of temperature\nand Fe abundance of HCG 62 obtained from the ROSAT\ndeprojection analysis where we have used the old photospheric solar Fe abundances for consistent comparison\nwith Finoguenov & Ponman. Because of the steep Fe\nabundance gradient we chose a slope of 2 to bound the\nradial logarithmic Fe abundance derivative. (We arrived\nat this choice after trying several different values and from\ncomparison to results obtained without deprojection \u2013 see\n\u00a73.3.) We also show the results when the maximum Fe\nabundance derivative is set to 1. These latter results agree\nwell with the ASCA and ROSAT deprojection results of\nFinoguenov & Ponman; e.g., for r \u223c 30 kpc we obtain\nZFe \u223c 0.6Z\u2299 which is within the 90% limits of their ASCA\nresult and in excellent agreement with their ROSAT value.\nThis value is to be contrasted with ZFe \u223c 1.3Z\u2299 obtained\nat that radius when we set the maximum Fe abundance\nderivative to 2.\nTherefore, we attribute the smaller Fe abundances obtained by Finoguenov & Ponman for HGC 62 to their\noverly restrictive regularization criteria. Interestingly, unlike their ASCA analysis of HCG 62, their ROSAT deprojection does not perform actual regularization but rather\nadopts simple smooth analytical models which apparently\nachieve the same effect. Finoguenov & Ponman do apply their regularization method to the deprojection of the\nROSAT data of NGC 5044, and we can only reproduce\ntheir temperatures and small Fe abundances if we require\nthe radial logarithmic derivatives of both the temperature\nand Fe abundance to be \u2264 0.2! In fact, given the steep Fe\nabundance gradients we obtain for most of the systems analyzed in the Finoguenov papers over-smoothing probably\naccounts for most of the Fe abundance differences between\nour papers.\n5.3. Implications and Future Work\nThe Fe abundance gradients of these bright, nearby cooling flow galaxies and groups reflect the history of star formation and the dynamical evolution of the hot gas in these\nsystems. In Figure 7 we compare the Fe abundances we\nhave measured for NGC 4472 with those predicted from\na gas-dynamical metal enrichment model which assumes\n(1) a Galactic IMF, (2) accretion of primordial gas arising from secondary infall, and (3) a Type Ia supernova\n(SNIa) rate normalized to the observed value in nearby\nE/S0 galaxies reported by Cappellaro et al (1997). The\nqualitative agreement is clear, though the deviations at\nlarger radii indicate that the ram pressure distortions discussed by Irwin & Sarazin (1996) compromise to some extent the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas-dynamical model.\nThe relative contributions of the supernovae to the Fe\nabundance within \u223c 50 kpc are consistent with the \"solar supernova proportion\" defined by Renzini et al (1993):\ni.e., enrichment models of the Milky Way indicate that\n1/4 of the Fe in the Sun arises from Type II supernovae\n(SNII) and the remaining 3/4 arises from SNIa. Consequently, the approximately solar Fe abundances we have\n\n\f14\n\nFig. 6.- Sensitivity to regularization criteria: (Left) Temperature and (Right) Fe abundance profiles of HCG 62 obtained from deprojection\nanalysis of the ROSAT data for models with fixed Galactic column density (and no added edge). The squares and solid diamonds represent\nmodels where the absolute values of the radial logarithmic derivatives of the temperature and Fe abundance are required to be \u2264 1 and \u2264 2\nrespectively which are the same criteria we used for the models of HCG 62 in \u00a74.2. The crosses and dashed diamonds represent the case where\nthe Fe abundance derivative is required to be \u2264 1. To facilitate the comparison we have used the old photospheric solar Fe abundance (Fe/H\nis 4.68 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) as is done in Finoguenov & Ponman (1999) which leads to smaller values of ZFe than obtained in Figure 3.\n\n3\n\n2\nSNII\nSNIa\n1\n\nstars\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLog r (kpc)\nFig. 7.- Comparison of the measured Fe abundances of NGC 4472 with a gas-dynamical metal enrichment model (F. Brighenti and W.\nMathews, in preparation). The model is identical to those described by Brighenti & Mathews (1999) having a Galactic IMF and accretion\nof primordial gas except that the SNIa rate is normalized to the observed value in nearby E/S0 galaxies reported by Cappellaro et al (1997).\nThe data points refer to those in Figure 2 for NGC 4472 using our favored model where the standard absorber has fixed Galactic column\ndensity and where an intrinsic oxygen edge is included in the model.\n\nfound for the brightest galaxies and groups within r \u223c 50\nkpc are consistent with models of the chemical enrichment\nof the Milky way and allow for the possibility of a universal\nIMF (e.g., Renzini et al. 1993; Renzini 1997, 2000; Wyse\n1997). The problems associated with the theoretical interpretation of the very sub-solar Fe abundances inferred\n\nfrom previous studies of these systems (e.g., Renzini et al.\n1993; Arimoto et al. 1997; Renzini 1997) are eliminated\nby the approximately solar Fe abundances we have inferred\nfrom both ASCA and ROSAT data of bright galaxies and\ngroups.\nThe sub-solar Fe abundances at large radii require ad-\n\n\f15\nditional explanation, such as the dilution arising from the\naccretion of primordial material included in the model in\nFigure 7. An alternative explanation for negative Fe abundance gradients as the consequence of the sedimentation\nof heavier elements (Fabian & Pringle 1977; see Qin & Wu\n2000 for a recent discussion) seems less plausible since the\ndrift velocities are generally similar to or less than the flow\nvelocities in a cooling flow.\nWe mention that the Fe abundance at large radius\n(>\n\u223c 100 kpc) predicted by the model for NGC 4472 (Figure 7) arises entirely from SNII ejecta. These SNII explosions accompanied the initial burst of star formation\nwhich ended at a redshift before \u223c 2. Hence, the Fe abundance measured at such large radii is a direct fossil record\nof the ISM abundance at high redshift. For those systems\nwhere we have measured Fe abundances at r >\n\u223c 100 kpc\nwe find ZFe \u223c 0.5Z\u2299. If they are indeed the result of\nthe initial SNII enrichment these large Fe abundances are\nconsistent with the arguments that large quantities of the\nmetals at high redshift reside in hot gaseous halos (Pettini\n1999, 2000) and that there was a prompt initial enrichment\nof the early universe (Renzini 1997, 2000).\nFinally, Chandra and XMM will substantially clarify our\nunderstanding of the metal enrichment and gas dynamics\nin cooling flows. Their superior spatial and spectral resolution will enable abundances to be measured on scales\n\nr<\n\u223c 1 kpc which is critical since the ROSAT data suggest\nthat the gradients may be largest at small radii (\u00a74.2).\nThese new missions will also allow accurate mapping of\nthe abundances of several \u03b1 elements (e.g., Si) which is\nof special importance because the \u03b1/Fe ratios provide the\nstrongest constraints on the relative numbers of Type II\nand Type Ia supernovae. The detailed constraints on the\nsupernovae feedback in these nearby cooling flows will be\ninvaluable for interpreting the star formation process in\ngalaxies at high redshift (Cavaliere et al, 2000).\nIt is a pleasure to thank the referee, J.
