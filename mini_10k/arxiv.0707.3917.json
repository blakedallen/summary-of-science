One can transfer the weak values belonging to\na particular system onto another via indirect quantum\nmeasurement as introduced by Von Neumann [2], with a\ncaveat - the coupling strength between signal and probe\nmust be weak [1]. Such models are collectively, rather appropriately, known as weak measurements. Despite initial\ncontroversy, the concept of weak values and measurements have enjoyed a surge of theoretical development\n[1, 3, 4, 5, 6], and eventual experimental confirmation\n[7].\nPerhaps unexpectedly, weak measurements have an application in the currently open problem of entanglement\ndistillation of Gaussian states. So far, one possible approach was provided by distillation protocols involving\nthe subtraction of a definite number of photons [8, 9].\nIn contrast, the model reported here provides a general\nmethod for Procrustean entanglement distillation protocols which subtract or add an indefinite number of photons [10, 11]. These latter protocols probabilistically\nmodify the average number of photons of a particular\nentangled Gaussian state whilst preserving its essential\nGaussian features. Distillation of entangled resources is a\nmajor issue in quantum information processing, in particular for the development of quantum repeaters that allow\nfor fault tolerant communication between different information processors. In this paper we address these tasks\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: nvk@st-andrews.ac.uk\n\nusing mesoscopic, continuous variables, a viable and extremely promising alternative to the traditional quantum\nbit-based information processing.\nWe have discovered that [10, 11] are special cases of a\ngeneral weak measurement interaction. Using the weak\nvalue paradigm, we demonstrate how to construct a general model of such Procrustean protocols. Moreover, we\nidentify that the features of these protocols, namely success conditions and Gaussian preservation are not unique\nto the particular choices advocated in both [10, 11]. Instead, our general analysis reveals that the origin of\nthese features lie with the consequences of performing a\nweak measurement. Furthermore, our model constrains\nthe pre and post-selected ancilla states whilst providing\na method for determining which possible combinations\nwork. Indeed, [10, 11] emerge as examples of a general\nrule and we provide another example which of a possible\nconfiguration.\nThe protocols [10, 11] were suggested as possible resolutions to the following quantum communication scenario. Suppose Alice and Bob wish to perform a particular continuous-variable entanglement assisted protocol. Further assume that they share a two-mode squeezed\nvacuum (TMSS) encoded in two light modes, as an entanglement resource [12, 13]:\n|\u03b6(\u03bb)i =\n\n\u221e\np\nX\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\u03bbn |n, ni.\n\n(2)\n\nn=0\n\nTo ensure maximum performance from their protocol,\nthey must possess a high quality entangled state. Ergo,\nthey wish to increase the entanglement of their shared\nentangled state before consuming it. Moreover, they require this to be done in a manner that will preserve its\nGaussian features. Accordingly, they want to probabilistically map their initial TMSS |\u03b6(\u03bb)i to another more\nentangled one |\u03b6(\u03bb\u2032 )i.\nII.\n\nTHE PROTOCOL\n\nTo solve this problem we use the Procrustean method\n[14], where we probabilistically modify the Schmidt coefficients of the input state to generate an output state\nwith a greater degree of entanglement whilst preserving\nthe basis. The following configuration is advocated, as\n\n\f2\ndepicted in fig(1), the entangled state in modes A and\nB is coupled to ancilla state in mode C by means of a\nunitary evolution between B and C. The requirements\nof the Procrustean method dictate that the interaction\nHamiltonian describing this process must be of the form\n\u0124I = h\u0304\u03ba(t)n\u0302B \u2297 \u00d4C .\n\n(3)\n\nThis is required to preserve the Schmidt basis of the\nTMSS, i.e. the Fock basis. Assuming the interaction\npersists for T seconds, then the corresponding unitary\nevolution operator is\nRT\n\u2212i\n\u03ba(t)n\u0302B \u00d4c\n0\n(4)\n= e\u2212i\u03baT n\u0302B \u00d4C ,\n\u00db = e\n\nwhere \u03baT = \u03ba(T ) \u2212 \u03ba(0).\nFollowing this, Bob performs a measurement on the\nancilla and post-selects it in the state |\u03a62 i. Consequently,\nthe state shared between Alice and Bob is given by\n|\u03a8f i = N h\u03a62 |e\u2212i\u03baT n\u0302B \u00d4C |\u03b6(\u03bb)i|\u03a61 i\n\u221e\nm\nX\n(\u2212i\u03baT )m h\u03a62 |\u00d4C\n|\u03a61 i m\n= N\u2032\nn\u0302B |\u03b6(\u03bb)i.\nm!\nh\u03a62 |\u03a61 i\nm=0\n\nh\u03a62 |\u00d4C |\u03a61 i\n,\nh\u03a62 |\u03a61 i\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=l\n\nd2k \u2265\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nc2k ,\n\n(12)\n\nk=l\n\nd \u227a c =\u21d2 f (d) \u2265 f (c).\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nis obeyed. Here |\u03c6i is an arbitrary vector in HA \u2297 HB\nm\nm\nand OW\n= h\u03a62 |\u00d4C\n|\u03a61 i/h\u03a62 |\u03a61 i. By using the linear\nindependence of the Schmidt basis of the TMSS we can\nexpress (8) as set of equations:\n!\nh\u03a62 |e\u2212i\u03baT n\u00d4C |\u03a61 i\nn\n\u2212i\u03baT nOW\n\u03bb\n\u2248 0 \u2200n \u2208 [0, \u221e).\n\u2212e\nh\u03a62 |\u03a61 i\n(9)\nAssuming that the above weakness condition is satisfied means that the output state is another TMSS as (7)\nyields\n|\u03a8f i =\n\nand as a result the entanglement content of the state is\nalso modified. It is in this sense that we can subtract or\nadd an indefinite number of photons to our target state.\nTo verify entanglement concentration, we use method of\nmajorization. Let d = (d20 , d21 , . . .)T be the ordered vector\nof the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of (7)\nand c = (c20 , c21 , . . .)T be the analogues object for the\ninitial TMSS. Then (7) is more entangled than |\u03b6(\u03bb)i if\nits reduced density matrices are more mixed. This will\nbe the case if d is majorized by c, which is written as\nd \u227a c and defined by [15, 16]\n\n(6)\n\nif the weakness condition\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212i\u03baT )m\nm\n{OW\n\u2212 (OW )m } n\u0302m\nb |\u03b6(\u03bb)i \u2248 0|\u03c6i\nm!\nm=2\n\n(11)\n\nfor l \u2208 [1, \u221e). This follows since measures of bipartite\npure state entanglement such as the Von Neumann entropy and the purity belong to the Shur concave [16] and\nhence, preserve the majorization order\n\nand so the final state of the system is given as\n|\u03a8f i = N \u2032 exp (\u2212i\u03baT OW n\u0302B ) |\u03b6(\u03bb)i,\n\n2\u03bb2\n2\u03bb2 e2\u03baT Img(OW )\n\u2192\n,\n2\n1\u2212\u03bb\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 e2\u03baT Img(OW )\n\n(5)\n\nThe weak value of \u00d4C is defined as\nOW =\n\nwhereas the imaginary part modifies the average number of photons in the state. Put succinctly, the induced\ntransformation is \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bbe\u2212i\u03baT OW . Thus, the average number of photons has been altered [12],\n\n\u221e\np\nX\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 e2\u03baT Img(OW )\n\u03bbn e\u2212i\u03baT OW n |n, ni,\nn=0\n\n(10)\nThis only holds subject to \u03bb2 e2Img(OW )\u03baT < 1, otherwise\nthe output state is un-physical as the normalisation constant will not converge. From (10) it can be seen that\nthe real part OW induces a phase shift on the TMSS\n\n(13)\n\nIt is sufficient for entanglement concentration to show\nthat the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of\nthe output state majorize those of the input state.\nThus, applying the majorization condition to the states\n(7) and the initial TMSS yields\n\u0010\n\n\u03bbe2\u03baT Img(OW )\n\n\u0011l\n\n> \u03bbl ,\n\n(14)\n\n\u2200l \u2208 [1, \u221e]. The only way to satisfy (14) is if the imaginary part of OW is positive for all l (assuming \u03baT > 0).\n\nFigure 1: Bob mixes his half of the TMSS with an ancillary\nmode pre-selected in |\u03a61 i via an non-linear photonic interaction described by the Hamiltonian \u0124I . The ancilla mode is\nthen subjected to a post-selected measurement leaving it in the\nstate |\u03a62 i.\n\n\f3\nEntanglement concentration then only occurs if\n!\nh\u03a62 |\u00d4C |\u03a61 i\n> 0.\nImg\nh\u03a62 |\u03a61 i\n\n(15)\n\nConsequently, the protocol provides a success condition\nfor entanglement concentration based on the properties\nof the weak value of a particular observable. This in conjugation with condition (9) provides a number of constraints that the interaction Hamiltonian \u0124I , the preselected and post-selected ancilla states |\u03a61 i and |\u03a62 i\nand the observable \u00d4C must obey in order to produce\nentanglement concentration of the TMSS. It is interesting to note that the weak condition (9) coupled with the\nrequirements of the Procrustean method are all that is\nrequired to preserve the gaussian character of the TMSS.\nIII.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nWe now demonstrate that previously discovered protocols of this type can emerge as special examples of the\ngeneral model advocated here. We will also calculate the\nassociate weak values and demonstrate that the weakness condition is satisfied. The previous schemes [10]\nand [11], required that Bob's half of the TMSS be mixed\nwith an ancillary coherent state |\u03b1i, where \u03b1 \u2208 R and\n\u03b1 > 0, in a non-linear medium exhibiting the cross Kerr\neffect \u0124I = h\u0304\u03ba(t)n\u0302B n\u0302C before being subjected to a measurement and post-selection condition. Using the success\ncondition (15), we can derive a constraint on the possible\npost-selected ancilla states which will allow us to select\nmeasurement strategies the lead to Gaussian-preserving\nentanglement concentration. Thus, we are interested in\nthe weak values of the number operator n\u0302C :\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\n\u03b1 /2\n\u2212\u03b12 /2\ne\nh\u03a6\n|\u03b1i\ne\n\u03b1\u2202\n2\n\u03b1\nh\u03a62 |n\u0302C |\u03b1i\nnW =\n=\n. (16)\nh\u03a62 |\u03b1i\nh\u03a62 |\u03b1i\nThe second equality in (16) follows from \u03b1\u2202\u03b1 (\u03b1n ) = n\u03b1n .\nFurthermore, if we assume\nh\u03a62 |\u03b1i = R(\u03b1)e\n\ni\u03b8(\u03b1)\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere R(\u03b1) and \u03b8(\u03b1) are the magnitude and phase of the\nscalar product of h\u03a62 |\u03b1i, then after some algebra (16) can\nbe written as\nnW = \u03b12 +\n\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u03b1 \u2202R\n+ i\u03b1 .\nR(\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(18)\n\nConsequently, the success condition requires that\nImg(nW ) > 0 \u21d4 \u03b1\u2202\u03b1 \u03b8(\u03b1) > 0. Thus, the only variants of this family of protocols which achieve the desired\neffect are those where the phase of h\u03a62 |\u03b1i is a monotonic\nincreasing function of \u03b1. This prediction allows us to\nrecover previously suggested protocols and uncover new\nvariants.\n\nFiur\u00e0\u0161ek, Mi\u0161ta and Filip (2003) [10]. In this scheme,\nthe ancillary coherent state is projected onto |\u03b2i =\n||\u03b2|ei\u03c6 i via eight-port-Homodyne detection.

Here balanced Homodyne detection is employed by Bob, in other words,\nthe post-selected state of the ancilla is the quadrature\neigenstate |x\u03c6 i = |\u03a62 i where X\u0302\u03c6 |x\u03c6 i = x\u03c6 |x\u03c6 i and\nX\u0302\u03c6 = 2\u22121/2 (ei\u03c6 \u00e2\u2020 + e\u2212i\u03c6 \u00e2).

Thus, both schemes require the\nbalancing between the initial Schmidt coefficients and the\nmagnitude of the non-linear coupling.\nSqueezed vacuum post-selection scheme. To generate\nfurther examples, we simply need to identify further\nquantum optical states that satisfy \u2202\u03b1\u03b8(\u03b1) > 0. An\nimmediate and obvious choice is given by selecting the\npost-selected state as a single mode squeezed vacuum\n|\u03a62 i = |rei\u03c6 i since [12]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u03b12\nhrei\u03c6 |\u03b1i = sechr exp \u2212 {1 + e\u2212i\u03c6 tanh r} .

Clearly (30) can only be\nsatisfied if \u03baT n << 1. Note that for large n, (30) holds\nbecause \u03bbn \u2192 1. In this example, the power of the weak\nvalue approach is evident due to its ability to provide an\nelegant shortcut to the required operation conditions.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\na general weak measurement model that allows for the\nprobabilistic transformation of an input TMSS |\u03b6(\u03bb)i to\nan output |\u03b6(\u03bb\u2032 )i. This model allows several useful features. Firstly, we can formulate an entanglement concentration success condition dependant on the magnitude of\nthe imaginary part of the weak value. Moreover, this\nsuccess condition also puts a constrain on the initial ancilla states and the subsequent measurement strategy employed. Secondly, the weakness criterion in conjunction\nwith the requirements of the Procrustean method guarantee that the entanglement concentration will be Gaussian\npreserving. As a consequence of the universality of the\nmodel provided here, it is a simple matter to determine\nnovel examples of this protocol by appealing to the imaginary part of the ancilla's weak value. Indeed, we attempt\nto justify this viewpoint by providing another example of\nthis entanglement concentration protocol inspired purely\nfrom observations of the imaginary weak value.\nDespite the advances offered by adopting the weak\nmeasurement paradigm here, there remain a number of\noutstanding problems. For example, can we generalize\nthis model to account for type-preserving Procrustean\nentanglement concentration for arbitrary continuousvariable pure bipartite entangled states? Furthermore,\nwe note that the weak condition itself is never totally\nsatisfied. Indeed, whereas it is easy to satisfy (9) for\nsmall and large n by requiring that \u03bb < 1 and \u03baT << 1,\nit is, however, not clear if weakness condition is true for\nintermediate values of n. It is then natural to enquire\nthe consequences of, if any, such violations to the ability\nof the protocol to deliver Gaussian preserving entanglement concentration. In principle, we would like to obtain\na quantitative relation between the magnitude of the violation and the ability of (15) to act as a success condition.\nThe weakness condition allows the Gaussian preservation\nand so failure of the condition results in a non-Gaussian\noutput state. Thus, we could measure the violation of (9)\nby measuring the extent of the non-Gaussian character\nof the output state. However, obtaining such a quantitative relation is highly non-trivial as the features of the\nnon-Gaussian entangled states cannot, in many cases, be\ncalculated in an analytical fashion. Consequently, the\nformulation of such a relation remains a goal for future\nresearch.\n\nIn conclusion, we have illustrated an application of\nweak measurements for a Gaussian preserving entanglement concentration. In particular, we have provided\n\nAcknowledgements. This work was supported by the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and\nby the EU project FP6-511004 COVAQIAL.\n\n[1] Y.
