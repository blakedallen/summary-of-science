Identifying the plane with C, the set of complex\nnumbers, A \u223c B if there are complex numbers w and z 6= 0 such that B = zA + w. Here,\nzA = {za : a \u2208 A} and A + w = {a + w : a \u2208 A}.\nConsider a finite set of points P in the plane, |P | \u2265 3. We refer to P as a pattern (P is usually\nfixed). For any finite set of points Q, we define SP (Q) to be the number of similar copies of P\ncontained in Q. More precisely,\n\b\nSP (Q) = P \u2032 \u2286 Q : P \u2032 \u223c P .\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to explicitly construct point sets Q in general position with a large\nnumber of similar copies of the pattern P , that is, with large SP (Q). By general position we\nmean to forbid triples of collinear points, although we also consider the restriction of allowing at\nmost m points on a line, m \u2265 3, and the stronger restriction of not allowing collinear points or\nparallelograms in Q.\nSome preliminary results appeared in [3]\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Point-set in general position with many triples spanning equilateral triangles.\n\nTo explain the motivation of this paper we first turn to the original problem. Erd\u0151s and Purdy\n[9]-[11] posed the problem of maximizing the number of similar copies of P contained in a set of n\npoints in the plane. That is, to determine the function\nSP (n) = max SP (Q) ,\n|Q|=n\n\nwhere the maximum is taken over all point-sets Q \u2286 C with n points. Elekes and Erd\u0151s [7] noted\nthat SP (n) \u2264 n (n \u2212 1) for any pattern P . They gave a quadratic lower bound for SP (n) when\n|P | = 3 or when all the coordinates of the points in P are algebraic numbers. They also proved a\nslightly subquadratic lower bound for all other patterns P . (The precise statements can be found\nin Section 5.) Later, Laczkovich and Ruzsa [13] characterized precisely those patterns for which\nSP (n) = \u0398(n2 ). However, the coefficient of the quadratic term is not known for any non-trivial\npattern, not even for the simplest case of P an equilateral triangle [2]. Elekes and the authors [4]\ninvestigated the structural properties of the n-sets Q that achieve a quadratic number of similar\ncopies of a pattern P . We proved that those sets contain large lattice-like structures, and therefore,\nmany collinear points. In particular, the next result was obtained.\nTheorem A ( \u00c1brego et al. [4]). For every positive integer m and every real c > 0, there is a\nthreshold function N0 = N0 (c, m) with the following property: if n \u2265 N0 and Q is an n-set with\nSP (Q) \u2265 cn2 , then Q has m points on a line forming an arithmetic progression.\n\nThus having many points on a line is a required property to achieve \u0398(n2 ) similar copies of\na pattern P . It is only natural to restrict the problem of maximizing SP (Q) over sets Q with a\nlimited number of possible collinear points. Given natural numbers n and m \u2265 3, we restrict the\nmaximum in SP (n) to n-sets with at most m \u2212 1 collinear points. We denote this maximum by\nSP (n, m) = max {SP (Q) : |Q| = n and no m points of Q are collinear} .\n2\n\n\fWe mention here that Erd\u0151s' unit distance problem [8] (arguably the most important problem in\nthe area), has also been studied under general position assumptions, like no 3 points on a line [11]\nand also no parallelograms [14] (see also [6, Sections 5.1 and 5.5]).\nWhen the maximum of SP (Q) is taken over n-sets in general position, that is, no three collinear\npoints, we obtain the function SP (n, 3), which we simply denote by SP\u2032 (n). By definition, it is clear\nthat SP\u2032 (n) \u2264 SP (n, m1 ) \u2264 SP (n, m2 ) \u2264 SP (n) whenever m1 \u2264 m2 . Moreover,\n\u0001 if m is constant,\nthen Theorem A implies that limn\u2192\u221e SP (n, m)/n2 = 0, i.e., SP (n, m) = o n2 . We believe that\nthe true asymptotic value of SP (n, m) is close to quadratic; however, prior to this work there were\nno lower bounds other than the trivial SP\u2032 (n) = \u03a9(n). The rest of the paper is devoted to the\nconstruction of point-sets giving non-trivial lower bounds for SP (n, m).\n\n2\n\nStatement of results\n\nThe symmetries of the pattern P play an important role in the order of magnitude of our lower\nbound to the function SP (n, m). Let us denote by Iso+ (P ) the group of orientation-preserving\nisometries of the pattern P , also known as the proper symmetry group of P . Define the index of a\npoint set A with respect to the pattern P , denoted by iP (A), as\n\u0001\nlog Iso+ (P ) SP (A) + |A|\n.\niP (A) =\nlog |A|\nObserve that 1 \u2264 iP (A) \u2264 2, because Iso+ (P ) SP (A) \u2264 |A|2 \u2212 |A| as was noted by Elekes and\nErd\u0151s, and moreover, iP (A) = 1 if and only if SP (A) = 0. Our main theorem gives a lower bound\nfor SP (n, m) using the index as the corresponding exponent. Its proof, presented in Section 3, is\nbased on iterated Minkovski Sums.\nTheorem 1. For any A and P finite sets in the plane with at most m \u2212 1 collinear points, there\nis a constant c = c(P, A) such that, for n large enough,\nSP (n, m) \u2265 cniP (A) .\nBy using A = P , we conclude that the function SP (n, m) is superlinear, that is for any finite\npattern P with at most m \u2212 1 collinear points, SP (n, m) \u2265 \u03a9(nlog(1+|P |)/ log|P | ). So the key to\nobtaining good lower bounds for these functions, is to begin with a set A with large index. For a\ngeneral pattern P , we can marginally improve the last inequality by constructing a better initial\nset A. The proof of next theorem is in Section 4.1.\nTheorem 2. For any finite pattern P with at most m \u2212 1 collinear points and |P | = k \u2265 3, there\nis a constant c = c(P ) such that, for n large enough,\nSP (n, m) \u2265 cnlog(k\n\n2 +k)/ log\n\n(k2 \u2212k+1) .\n\nThe following theorems summarize the lower bounds for SP\u2032 (n) obtained from the best known\ninitial sets A for some specific patterns P . We concentrate on triangles and regular polygons. We\noften refer to a finite pattern as a geometric figure. For instance, when we say \"let P be the\nequilateral triangle\" we actually mean the set of vertices of an equilateral triangle.\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 3. Let P = T be a triangle.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032 (n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 102/ log 15 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.707 .\nIf T = \u25b3 is equilateral, then S\u25b3\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIf T is isosceles, then ST\u2032 (n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 17/ log 8 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.362 .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIf T is almost any scalene triangle, then ST\u2032 (n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 40/ log 14 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.397 . For all others,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nST\u2032 (n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 9/ log 5 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.365 .\n\nIn general, \u0001if P is a k-sided regular polygon, then iP (P ) = log (2k) / log k and thus SP (n) \u2265\n\u03a9 nlog(2k)/ log k . If k is even, 4 \u2264 k \u2264 10 or if k = 5 we have the following improvement.\nTheorem 4. Let P = R(k) be a regular k-gon. Then\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nSR(4)\n(n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 144/ log 24 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.563 ,\nSR(6)\n(n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 528/ log 84 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.414 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nSR(8)\n(n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 1312/ log 208 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.345 , SR(10)\n(n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 2640/ log 420 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.304 , and\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032\nSR(5)\n(n) \u2265 \u03a9 nlog 264/ log 120 \u2265 \u03a9 n1.519 .\n\nIn Section 4.4, we briefly explore the behavior of the function SP (n, m) for larger values of\nm and P = \u25b3 the equilateral triangle. We then present general asymptotic results, for arbitrary\npatterns, when m = m(n) is a function of n such that m(n) \u2192 \u221e when n \u2192 \u221e. In this case we\nprove that SP (n, m) \u2265 n2\u2212\u03b5 for every n sufficiently large.\nAfter having relative success constructing point sets with not many points on a line, we impose harder restrictions by prohibiting parallelograms (and collinear points) in the sets Q. This\nrestriction immediately forbids the use of Minkovski Sums. We are able to construct n-sets Q\nwith \u03a9(n log n) copies of a pattern P without parallelograms (or collinear triples). We also show a\nnon-trivial upper bound for these patterns, namely, we prove that at most O(n3/2 ) copies of P are\npossible. These results are presented in Section 6.\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nLet P and A be sets with no m collinear points. With A as a base set, we recursively construct\nlarge sets with no m collinear points and with large number of similar copies of P . Our main tool is\nthe Minkovski Sum of two sets A, B \u2286 C, defined as the set A + B = {a + b : a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B}. First\nwe have the following observation.\nProposition 1. Let P = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pk } and Q = {q1 , q2 , . . . , qk } be sets with k elements. P is\nsimilar to Q, with pj corresponding to qj if and only if\npj \u2212 p1\nqj \u2212 q1\n=\nfor j = 1, 2, . . . , k.\nq2 \u2212 q1\np2 \u2212 p1\nProof. If P \u223c Q with qj = zpj + w, where z 6= 0 and w are fixed complex numbers, then\nqj \u2212 q1\n(zpj + w) \u2212 (zp1 + w)\npj \u2212 p1\n=\n=\n.\nq2 \u2212 q1\n(zp2 + w) \u2212 (zp1 + w)\np2 \u2212 p1\nReciprocally, if (qj \u2212 q1 ) / (q2 \u2212 q1 ) = (pj \u2212 p1 ) / (p2 \u2212 p1 ) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, then letting z = (q2 \u2212\nq1 )/(p2 \u2212 p1 ) and w = q1 \u2212 zp1 we get that qj = zpj + w and z 6= 0.\nWe now bound the number of copies of P in the sum A + B. To be concise, let I = Iso+ (P ) .\n4\n\n\fLemma 1. Let P be any finite pattern, and B and C finite sets such that B + C has exactly |B| |C|\npoints. Then\nI * SP (B + C) + |B| |C| \u2265 (I * SP (B) + |B|) (I * SP (C) + |C|) .\nProof. Suppose that P = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pk } and let \u03bbj denote the ratio (pj \u2212 p1 ) / (p2 \u2212 p1 ). Let\nPB = {b1 , b2 , . . . , bk } \u2286 B and PC = {c1 , c2 , . . . , ck } \u2286 C be corresponding copies of P with\nP \u223c PB \u223c PC . Then by the previous proposition,\ncj \u2212 c1\npj \u2212 p1\nbj \u2212 b1\n=\n=\n= \u03bbj .\nb2 \u2212 b1\nc2 \u2212 c1\np2 \u2212 p1\nSince B + C has exactly |B| |C| elements, then the relation (b, c) \u2194 b + c for b \u2208 B, c \u2208 C is\nbijective. For any orientation-preserving isometry f of PC (which uniquely corresponds to an\nelement of Iso+ (P )), consider the set Q = {qj := bj + f (cj ) : j = 1, 2, ..., k} \u2286 B + C. Since\n(f (cj ) \u2212 f (c1 )) / (f (c2 ) \u2212 f (c1 )) = (cj \u2212 c1 ) / (c2 \u2212 c1 ) = \u03bbj , then\nqj \u2212 q1\nbj \u2212 b1 + f (cj ) \u2212 f (c1 )\n\u03bbj (b2 \u2212 b1 + f (c2 ) \u2212 f (c1 ))\n=\n=\n= \u03bbj .\nq2 \u2212 q1\nb2 \u2212 b1 + f (c2 ) \u2212 f (c1 )\nb2 \u2212 b1 + f (c2 ) \u2212 f (c1 )\nThat is, by the previous proposition, Q \u223c P . Thus every similar copy PB of P in B together\nwith a similar copy PC of P in C originate I distinct similar copies of P in B + C. We also have\nthe 'liftings' of P in B and C. That is, similar copies of P of the form (b, c1 ), (b, c2 ), . . . , (b, ck )\nor (b1 , c), (b2 , c), . . . , (bk , c), with b \u2208 B and c \u2208 C. All these copies of P in B + C are different\nbecause |B + C| = |B| |C|. Therefore the number of similar copies of P in B + C is at least\nI * SP (B) SP (C) + |B| SP (C) + |C| SP (B). In other words\nI * SP (B + C) + |B| |C| \u2265 I 2 * SP (B) SP (C) + I * |B| SP (C) + I * |C| SP (B) + |B| |C|\n= (I * SP (B) + |B|) (I * SP (C) + |C|) .\n\nThe next lemma allows us to preserve the maximum number of collinear points when we use\nthe Minkovsky Sum of two appropriate sets.\nLemma 2. Let A and B be two sets with no m points on a line, m \u2265 3. If S is the set of points\nv \u2208 C for which A+ vB has less than |A| |B| points, or m points on a line; then S has zero Lebesgue\nmeasure.\nFor presentation purposes we defer its proof and instead proceed to the proof of the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let A1 = A\u22171 = A and suppose Aj and A\u2217j have been defined. By Lemma 2\nthere is a set Aj+1 , similar to A, such that A\u2217j+1 := A\u2217j + Aj+1 does not have m points on a line\nand |A\u2217j+1 | = |A\u2217j ||Aj+1 |. For every j \u2265 1, |A\u2217j | = |A\u2217j\u22121 ||A| = |A\u2217j\u22122 ||A|2 = * * * = |A|j . Moreover,\nby Lemma 1, it follows that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nI * SP A\u2217j + A\u2217j = I * SP A\u2217j\u22121 + Aj + A\u2217j\u22121 |Aj |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2265 I * SP A\u2217j\u22121 + A\u2217j\u22121 (I * SP (A) + |A|)\n\u2265 ***\n\n\u2265 (I * SP (A) + |A|)j .\n\n5\n\n\fIf SP (A) = 0, then iP (A) = 1 and the result is trivial. Assume iP (A) > 1 and suppose\n|A|j \u2264 n < |A|j+1 . The previous inequality yields\n1\n((I * SP (A) + |A|)j \u2212 |A|j )\nI\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011 1 \u0012 n \u0013iP (A)\n1\nj*iP (A)\n|A|\n\u2212n \u2265\n\u2212n\n\u2265\nI\nI\n|A|\n\nSP (n, m) \u2265 SP (A\u2217j ) \u2265\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\u2265 cniP (A) ,\n\nfor some constant c = c(A, P ) if n is large enough. For instance, c = (2I |A|iP (A) )\u22121 works whenever\nniP (A)\u22121 \u2265 2 |A|iP (A) .\nFigure 1 shows a set A\u22173 obtained from this procedure when P = \u25b3 the equilateral triangle\nand A is the starting set with 15 points and 29 equilateral triangles constructed in Section 4.2.3.\nFinally, we present the proof of Lemma 2.\nProof of Lemma 2. We show that S is the union of a finite number of algebraic sets, all of them\nof real dimension at most one. This immediately implies that the Lebesgue measure of such a set\nis zero. For every a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B, let q(a, b) = a + vb. Suppose that q(a1 , b1 ) = q(a2 , b2 ) with\n(a1 , b1 ) 6= (a2 , b2 ). Then v(b2 \u2212 b1\u0001) + (a2 \u2212 a1 ) = 0 and b1 6= b2 . Thus v = \u2212(a2 \u2212 a1 )/(b2 \u2212 b1 ).\nTherefore there are at most |A||B|\nvalues of v for which A + vB has less than |A| |B| points.\n2\nNow, suppose that the set {q(aj , bj ) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m} consists of m points on a line, where {aj } \u2286 A\nand {bj } \u2286 B. Then for 3 \u2264 j \u2264 m, we have q(aj , bj ) \u2212 q(a1 , b1 ) = \u03bbj (q(a2 , b2 ) \u2212 q(a1 , b1 )) where\n\u03bbj 6= 0, 1 is a real number. Thus for 3 \u2264 j \u2264 m,\nv (bj \u2212 b1 \u2212 \u03bbj (b2 \u2212 b1 )) = \u03bbj (a2 \u2212 a1 ) \u2212 (aj \u2212 a1 ) .\n\n(3)\n\nFirst assume all bj are equal. Then all aj are pairwise different, otherwise we would have less\nthan m points initially. Moreover, Equation (3) implies that (aj \u2212 a1 )/(a2 \u2212 a1 ) = \u03bbj \u2208 R for all\n3 \u2264 j \u2264 m. But this contradicts the fact that there are no m points on a line in A. By possibly\nrelabeling the points, we can now assume that b1 6= b2 . If bj \u2212 b1 \u2212 \u03bbj (b2 \u2212 b1 ) 6= 0 for some j, then\nv=\u2212\n\n\u03bbj (a2 \u2212 a1 ) \u2212 (aj \u2212 a1 )\n.\n\u03bbj (b2 \u2212 b1 ) \u2212 (bj \u2212 b1 )\n\nM\u00f6bius Transformations send circles (or lines) to circles (or lines); thus the last equation, seen as\na parametric equation on the real variable \u03bbj , represents a circle (or a line) in the plane. The\nremaining case is when\nbj \u2212 b1 \u2212 \u03bbj (b2 \u2212 b1 ) = 0 for 3 \u2264 j \u2264 m.\n(4)\nSince \u03bbj 6= 0, 1, then bj 6= b1 , b2 . Suppose bj = bk for 3 \u2264 j < k \u2264 m, then \u03bbj = \u03bbk and by (3) and\n(4) we deduce that aj = ak . This contradicts the fact that q(aj , bj ) and q(ak , bk ) are two different\npoints. Therefore all the bj are pairwise different, and then by (4) all the bj are on a line. This is\na contradiction since there are no m points on a line in B.\n\u0001\nTherefore S is the union of a finite number of points and at most |A||B|\ncircles (or lines), and\nm\nconsequently it has zero Lebesgue measure.\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nConstructions of the initial sets\n\nAll the constructions of the initial sets A we provide have explicit coordinates so it is possible to\ncalculate SP (A) via the following algorithm [5]: Fix two points p1 , p2 \u2208 P , for every ordered pair\n(a1 , a2 ) \u2208 A \u00d7 A of distinct points consider the unique orientation-preserving similarity transfora2 p1 \u2212a1 p2\n2\nmation f that maps p1 7\u2192 a1 and p2 7\u2192 a2 . An explicit expression is f (z) = ap11 \u2212a\n\u2212p2 z +\np1 \u2212p2 .\nThen verify whether f (P ) \u2286 A. If N is the number of pairs (a1 , a2 ) for which f (P ) \u2286 A, then\nSP (A) = N/ Iso+ (P ) . The running time of this algorithm is O(|P ||A|2 log |A|). Likewise, it is\npossible to verify that no 3 points are on a line by simply checking the pairwise slopes of every\ntriple of distinct points. We first present our construction for arbitrary patterns P .\n\n4.1\n\nArbitrary pattern P\n\nProof of Theorem 2. Let z0 \u2208 C\\P be an arbitrary point and let p1 , p2 \u2208 P be two fixed points\nin P . For every p \u2208 P , there is exactly one orientation-preserving similarity function\n\u0011 fp such that\n\u0010\n\n\u2212p\n0 p2\nz + ppp11\u2212z\np1 7\u2192 z0 and p2 7\u2192 p; indeed an explicit expression of such function is fp (z) = pz10\u2212p\n\u2212p2 .\n2\nLet A be the S\npoint set obtained by taking the image of P under every one of the functions fp ,\nthat is A = p\u2208P fp (P ). For almost all z0 , except for a subset of real dimension 1, the set\nA does not have m points on a line and all the sets fp (P )\\{z0 } are pairwise disjoint, that is\n|A| = 1 + k (k \u2212 1) = k2 \u2212 k + 1. This fact can be proved along the same lines as Lemma 2, we\nomit the details. By construction, each of the k sets fp (P ) is similar to P . For every q \u2208 P \\{p1 },\n\nFigure 2: A has no m points on a line, |A| = |P |2 \u2212 |P | + 1 points and SP (A) = 2 |P | \u2212 1.\nthe set\n{fp (q) : p \u2208 P } =\n\nz0 (q \u2212 p2 )\np1 \u2212 q\nP+\np1 \u2212 p2\np1 \u2212 p2\n\n(5)\n\nis also similar to P and different from the previous copies of P we counted before.

The intuitive reason for this is that it is harder to obtain better initial sets when the\npattern has any type of symmetries. This difficulty is overtaken by the factor Iso+ (P ) = 3 when\nP is an equilateral triangle. We extend our comments in the concluding remarks.\n\nFigure 3: (a) 5-point set A1 with ST (A1 ) = 4, (b) 14-point set A2 with ST (A2 ) = 26.\n\n4.2.1\n\nScalene triangles\n\nWe first give a construction for all scalene triangles. If the pattern P = T consists of the points\n(complex numbers) 0, 1, and z \u2208\n/ R, then the initial set A1 = {0, 1, z, w = z \u2212 1 + 1/z, wz} is\nin general position for every scalene triangle T , see Figure 3(a). A1 has 4 triangles similar to\nT : (0, 1, z) , (z, w, 1) , (1, z, wz) and (0, w, wz). For all z, but a 1-dimensional subset of C, the\nconstruction in Figure 3(b) is in general position and gives a better lower bound for ST\u2032 (n). The\n\n8\n\n\f\b\ncorresponding initial set is A2 = A \u222a A\u2032 where A = A1 \u222a zA1 \u222a wz 2 / (z \u2212 1) and A\u2032 is the \u03c0rotation of A about wz/2, that is A\u2032 = \u2212A + wz. Because some points overlap, A2 has only 14\npoints,\n\b\nA2 = 0, 1, z, w, wz, z 2 , wz 2 , wz 2 / (z \u2212 1) , wz \u2212 1, wz \u2212 z, wz \u2212 w, 1 \u2212 z, wz (1 \u2212 z) , wz/ (1 \u2212 z) .\n\nAmong the points in A2 , there are 6 similar copies of A1 with no triangles similar to T in common:\nz\nA1 , zA1 , 1\u2212z\n(A1 \u2212 wz), and their \u03c0-rotations about wz/2. In addition, the triangles (w, wz(1 \u2212\n2\nz), wz /(z \u2212 1)) and (wz 2 , wz \u2212 w, wz/(1 \u2212 z)) are similar to T and are not contained in the 6 sets\nsimilar to A1 mentioned before, so ST (A) \u2265 26.\n\nFigure 4: Sets Ai with |Ai | = 8 and ST (\u03b2) (Ai ) = 9.\n\nA1 is in general position for \u03b1 6=\nq\n\u221a\n\u03c0/12, \u03c0/6, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/3, or 5\u03c0/12, A2 is in general position for \u03b1 6= arccos (3 + 17)/8, \u03c0/6, \u03c0/4, or\n\u03c0/3.\n\n4.2.2\n\nIsosceles triangles\n\nLet the pattern P = T (\u03b1) be an isosceles triangle with angles \u03b1, \u03b1, and \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b1, where 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c0/2.\nWe use as initial set one of the following two constructions, each with 8 points and 9 copies of T (\u03b1),\ni.e., ST (\u03b1) (A) = 9. There are three exceptions that are analyzed later in Section 4.3.3: T (\u03c0/6),\nT (\u03c0/4), and the equilateral triangle T (\u03c0/3).\nLet u = e2\u03b1i oso that T (\u03b1) = {0, 1, \u2212u}.

When the pattern P = \u25b3 = {1, \u03c9, \u03c9 2 } is the\nequilateral triangle, we use as initial set A = B \u222a \u03c9B \u222a \u03c9 2 B where B = {1, \u2212z} \u222a (\u22121 + zP ).\nFor all z but\nsubset of C, the set A is in general position and |A| = 15. The\nS2 a 1-dimensional\nk\nset B1 = k=0 \u03c9 (\u22121 + zP ) is the Minkovski Sum \u2212P + zP , thus by Lemma 1 there are at\nleast 9 equilateral triangles in B1 . In addition (1, \u03c9, \u03c9 2 ) and (\u2212z, \u2212z\u03c9, \u2212z\u03c9 2 ) are equilateral,\nand each of the points 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9 2 is incident to 6 more equilateral triangles: (1, \u2212\u03c9 2 + z, \u2212\u03c9 2 z),\n(1, \u2212\u03c9 2 +z\u03c9, \u2212z), (1, \u2212\u03c9 2 +z\u03c9 2 , \u2212z\u03c9), (1, \u2212\u03c9 2 z, \u2212\u03c9 +z\u03c9), (1, \u2212z, \u2212\u03c9 +z\u03c9 2 ), and (1, \u2212\u03c9z, \u2212\u03c9 +z),\ntogether with the \u03c0/3- and 2\u03c0/3-rotations of these triangles about the origin.

Finally we explain how to use these initial sets for any pattern that is a subset\nof a regular polygon.\n4.3.1\n\nEven sided regular polygons.\n\nThe following construction of the initial set A is in general position for all even k, however the\nindex iR(k) (A) is only better than iR(k) (R(k)) when k \u2264 10. Let \u03c9 = e2\u03c0i/k , k even, and z \u2208 C an\narbitrary nonzero complex number. Suppose that the regular k-gon R(k) is given by R(k) = P =\n1 + \u03c9 + z{\u03c9 j : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1}. The reason why we translated the canonical regular polygon by\n1 + \u03c9 and rotated and magnified it by z will become apparent soon. To construct our initial set A,\nwe first follow the construction of Theorem 2 applied to P with p1 = 1 + \u03c9 + z, p2 = 1 + \u03c9 + z\u03c9,\nand z0 = 2.

It follows that every set of the form \u03c9 l Bj with j 6= k/2 is a subset of exactly two\nterms in the union from Equation (6) and it is disjoint from the rest.

More precisely, for\na parallelogram-free pattern P , define\n\u2226\n\nSP (n) = max {SP (A) : |A| = n and A is parallelogram-free} .\n\u2226\n\nWe obtain the following upper bound on SP (n).\n\nFigure 10: A parallelogram-free point set with n points and cn log n similar copies of P .\n\nTheorem 9. Let P be a parallelogram-free pattern with |P | \u2265 3. Then for all n,\n\u2226\n\nSP (n) \u2264 n3/2 + n.\nProof. Suppose A is an n-set in the plane in general position and with no parallelograms. Let\np1 , p2 , p3 be three points in P . Consider the following bipartite graph B. The vertex bipartition is\n(A, A); the edges are the pairs (a1 , a2 ) \u2208 A \u00d7 A , a1 6= a2 such that there is a point a3 \u2208 A with\n\u25b3a1 a2 a3 \u223c \u25b3p1 p2 p3 . Every similar copy of P in A has at least one edge (a1 , a2 ) associated to it.\nThus the number of edges E in our graph satisfies that E \u2265 SP (A). By a theorem of K\u0151vari et\nal. [12] (also referred in the literature as Zarankiewicz problem [15]), it is known that a bipartite\ngraph with n vertices on each class and without subgraphs isomorphic to K2,2 contains at most\n(n \u2212 1)n1/2 + n edges. To finish our proof we now show that B has no subgraphs isomorphic to\nK2,2 . Suppose by contradiction that (a1 , a3 ), (a1 , a4 ), (a2 , a3 ), (a2 , a4 ) are edges in B. Let \u03bb =\n(p3 \u2212 p1 )/(p2 \u2212 p1 ). By definition, there are points a13 , a14 , a23 , a24 \u2208 A such that \u25b3p1 p2 p3 \u223c\n\u25b3a1 a3 a13 \u223c \u25b3a1 a4 a14 \u223c \u25b3a2 a3 a23 \u223c \u25b3a2 a4 a24 . Thus a13 = a1 + \u03bb(a3 \u2212 a1 ), a14 = a1 + \u03bb(a4 \u2212 a1 ),\na23 = a2 + \u03bb(a3 \u2212 a2 ), and a24 = a2 + \u03bb(a4 \u2212 a2 ). Then a13 \u2212 a14 = a23 \u2212 a24 = \u03bb(a3 \u2212 a4 ), which\nmeans that a13 a14 a24 a23 is a parallelogram. This contradicts the parallelogram-free assumption on\nA.\n17\n\n\fWe make no attempt to optimize the coefficient of the n3/2 term, since we do not believe that\nis the right order of magnitude.\n\nn3/2\n\nTheorem 10. Let P be a parallelogram-free pattern with |P | \u2265 3. Then there is a constant c = c(P )\nsuch that for n \u2265 |P |,\n\u2226\nSP (n) \u2265 cn log n.\nFor every pattern P , we recursively construct a parallelogram-free point set with many occurrences of P . For any u, v \u2208 C, we define\n[\n[ [\nQ(P, A, u, v) =\n(up + (vp \u2212 p + 1) A) =\n(up + (vp \u2212 p + 1) a) .\n(7)\np\u2208P\n\np\u2208P a\u2208A\n\nAlmost all selections of u and v yield a set Q = Q(P, A, u, v) that is parallelogram-free and such\nthat all the terms in the double union are pairwise different. The proof of this technical fact is\ngiven by next lemma.\nLemma 3. Let A and P be parallelogram-free sets. If S is the set of points (u, v) \u2208 C2 for which\nQ = Q(P, A, u, v) satisfies that |Q| < |A| |P |, Q has three collinear points, or Q has a parallelogram;\nthen S has zero Lebesgue measure.\nWe defer the proof of this lemma and instead proceed to bound the number of similar copies of\nP in Q.\nLemma 4. If A and P are finite parallelogram-free sets , and Q = Q(P, A, u, v) defined in (7)\nsatsfies that |Q| = |A| |P |, then\nSP (Q) \u2265 |P | SP (A) + |A| .\nProof. Because |Q| = |A| |P | it follows that each term in the first union contributes exactly SP (A)\nsimilar copies of P , all of them pairwise different. In addition note that\n[\n(a + (u + va \u2212 a) P ) .\nQ=\na\u2208A\n\nSo each term in the new union is a similar copy of P , all of them different and also different from\nthe ones we had counted before. Therefore SP (Q) \u2265 |P | SP (A) + |A|.\nWe now prove the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 10. Let A1 = P and for m \u2265 1 let Am+1 be the parallelogram-free set Q obtained\nfrom Lemma 3 with A = Am . Because |Am+1 | = |A1 | |Am |, it follows that |Am | = |P |m for all\nm. Further, by Lemma 4, for every 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 2, SP (Am\u2212k ) \u2265 |P | SP (Am\u2212k\u22121 ) + |Am\u2212k\u22121 | =\n|P | SP (Am\u2212k\u22121 ) + |P |m\u2212k\u22121 . Thus\nSP (Am ) \u2265 |P | SP (Am\u22121 ) + |P |m\u22121 \u2265 |P |2 SP (Am\u22122 ) + 2 |P |m\u22121\n\u2265 * * * \u2265 |P |m\u22121 SP (A1 ) + (m \u2212 1) |P |m\u22121 = m |P |m\u22121 .\n\nNow, suppose |P |m \u2264 n < |P |m+1 with m \u2265 2. Let c = 1/(2 |P |2 log |P |), then\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\nlog n\n\u2226\nm\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2265 cn log n.\n>\nSP (n) \u2265 SP (Am ) \u2265 m |P |\nlog |P |\n|P |2\n\u2226\n\nIf |P | \u2264 n < |P |2 then SP (n) \u2265 SP (P ) = 1 > cn log n.\n18\n\n\fFinally, we present the proof of Lemma 3.\nProof of Lemma 3. We show that S is made of a finite number of algebraic sets, all of them of real\ndimension at most three. This immediately implies that the Lebesgue measure of such a set is zero.\nFor every p \u2208 P and a \u2208 A, let q(a, p) = (up + (vp \u2212 p + 1) a). Suppose that q(a1 , p1 ) = q(a2 , p2 )\nwith (a1 , p1 ) 6= (a2 , p2 ). Then\n(p1 \u2212 p2 ) u + (p1 a1 \u2212 p2 a2 ) v + a1 (1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2212 a2 (1 \u2212 p2 ) = 0.\nThis is the equation of a complex-line in C2 (with real-dimension two) unless the coefficients of u\nand v, as well as the independent term are equal to zero. That is, p1 \u2212 p2 = 0, (p1 a1 \u2212 p2 a2 ) = 0,\nand a1 (1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2212 a2 (1 \u2212 p2 ) = 0. These equations imply that (a1 , p1 ) = (a2 , p2 ) which contradicts\n|\u0001\nour assumption. Thus the set of pairs (u, v) for which |Q| < |A| |P | is the union of |A||P\nsets of\n2\nreal-dimension two.\nAssume that q(a1 , p1 ), q(a2 , p2 ), and q(a3 , p3 ) are three collinear points. Thus there is a real\n\u03bb 6= 0, 1 such that q(a2 , p2 ) \u2212 q(a1 , p1 ) = \u03bb (q(a3 , p3 ) \u2212 q(a1 , p1 )). Then\n(p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 \u2212 p1 )) u + (p2 a2 \u2212 p1 a1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 a3 \u2212 p1 a1 )) v+\n\na2 (1 \u2212 p2 ) \u2212 a1 (1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2212 \u03bb (a3 (1 \u2212 p3 ) \u2212 a1 (1 \u2212 p1 )) = 0.\n\nFor every \u03bb, the last equation represents a complex-line in C2 . Considering \u03bb as a real variable, this\nequation represents an algebraic set of real-dimension three. This happens unless the coefficients\nof u and v, as well as the independent term are equal to zero. That is, p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 \u2212 p1 ) = 0,\np2 a2 \u2212 p1 a1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 a3 \u2212 p1 a1 ) = 0, and a2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 \u03bb (a3 \u2212 a1 ) = 0. If p1 , p2 , p3 are three different points\nthen, since no three points in P are collinear, p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 \u2212 p1 ) 6= 0. If any two of p1 , p2 , p3 are\nequal and the remaining is different, then we still have p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 \u03bb(p3 \u2212 p1 ) 6= 0. Thus p1 = p2 = p3 ,\nand by symmetry a1 = a2 = a3 ; which contradicts the fact that we started with three distinct\u0001\n|\npoints q(aj , pj ). Thus the set of pairs (u, v) for which |Q| has collinear points is the union of |A||P\n3\nsets of real-dimension three.\nFinally, assume that q(a1 , p1 )q(a2 , p2 )q(a4 , p4 )q(a3 , p3 ) is a parallelogram. That is q(a2 , p2 ) \u2212\nq(a1 , p1 ) = q(a4 , p4 ) \u2212 q(a3 , p3 ), and thus\n(p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 (p4 \u2212 p3 )) u + (p2 a2 \u2212 p1 a1 \u2212 (p4 a4 \u2212 p3 a3 )) v+\n\na2 (1 \u2212 p2 ) \u2212 a1 (1 \u2212 p1 ) \u2212 (a4 (1 \u2212 p4 ) \u2212 a3 (1 \u2212 p3 )) = 0.\n\nAgain this equation represents a complex-line in C2 , unless the coefficients of u and v, as well as the\nindependent term are equal to zero. That is, p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 (p4 \u2212 p3 ) = 0, p2 a2 \u2212 p1 a1 \u2212 (p4 a4 \u2212 p3 a3 ) =\n0, and a2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 (a4 \u2212 a3 ) = 0. If p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 are four different points then, since P has no\nparallelograms, p2 \u2212 p1 \u2212 (p4 \u2212 p3 ) 6= 0. Since no three points of P are collinear there are two extra\npossibilities: (p1 , p2 ) = (p3 , p4 ) or (p1 , p3 ) = (p2 , p4 ). By symmetry we also have (a1 , a2 ) = (a3 , a4 )\nor (a1 , a3 ) = (a2 , a4 ). If (p1 , p2 ) = (p3 , p4 ) and (a1 , a2 ) = (a3 , a4 ), then q(a1 , p1 ) = q(a3 , p3 );\nwhich contradicts our assumption. Similarly, if (p1 , p3 ) = (p2 , p4 ) and (a1 , a3 ) = (a2 , a4 ), then\nq(a1 , p1 ) = q(a2 , p2 ). Assume (p1 , p2 ) = (p3 , p4 ) and (a1 , a3 ) = (a2 , a4 ). Then the equation p2 a2 \u2212\np1 a1 \u2212 (p4 a4 \u2212 p3 a3 ) = 0 becomes (p2 \u2212 p1 )(a1 \u2212 a3 ) = 0. But if p1 = p2 then q(p1 , a1 ) = q(p2 , a2 ),\nand if a1 = a3 then q(p1 , a1 ) = q(p3 , a3 ); a contradiction in both cases. The remaining case when\n(p1 , p3 ) = (p2 , p4 ) and (a1 , a2 ) = (a3 , a4 ) follows\n\u0001 by symmetry. Thus the set of pairs (u, v) for which\n|A||P |\n|Q| has parallelograms is the union of\nsets of real-dimension two.\n4\nRemark 1. If the sets A and P have no two parallel segments then it can be proved, along the lines\nof last lemma, that almost all the sets Q(A, P, u, v) are free of pairs of parallel segments as well.\n19\n\n\f7\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe main relevance of Theorem 1 is that it provides an effective tool to obtain better lower bounds\nfor SP (n, m). Indeed, any of the results for specific patterns in this paper, can be improved by\nfinding initial sets with larger indices. For a general pattern P , Theorem 2 is only slightly better\nthan the bound \u03a9(nlog(1+|P |)/ log|P | ) which is obtained using A = P as the initial set. There must\nbe a way to construct a better initial set.\nWhen the pattern P = T is a triangle we obtained a considerably larger bound when T is\nequilateral. The reason behind this is the fact that there is a multiplying factor of |Iso+ (T )| = 3 in\nthe index of iT (A). We could not construct initial sets for arbitrary isosceles triangles that would\nimprove the bound for scalene triangles. The mirror symmetry of the isosceles triangles became an\nobstacle when trying to construct sets with large indices. For instance, the set A1 in Section 4.2.1\nalways yields collinear points when T is an isosceles triangle.\nProblem 1. For every isosceles triangle T , find a set A such that iT (A) \u2265 log 9/ log 5.\nWe also had some limitations to construct initial sets when P = R(k) is a regular polygon. In\nthis case, the index obtained using P itself as initial set is log(2k)/ log k. We do not have a better\ninitial set for odd k \u2265 7 and in fact our construction of the initial set A for even-sided regular\nk-gons in Section 4.3.1 only gives an index iR(k) (A) better than log(2k)/ log k when k < 12.\nProblem 2. Let R(k) be a regular k-gon. For every even k \u2265 12 and odd k \u2265 7 find a set A such\nthat iR(k) (A) \u2265 log(2k)/ log k.\nWe are confident that there are some yet undiscovered methods for getting initial sets with larger\nindices. We would like to find such sets for some other classes of interesting geometric patterns.\nFor instance, right triangles, trapezoids, parallelograms, and sets already having some points on a\nline, like subsets of a lattice.\nAccording to Theorem 7, if we let the number of allowed collinear points to increase with n,\nthen we can achieve n2\u2212\u03b5 similar copies of a pattern P . We actually believe this is true even when\nm is constant.\nConjecture 1. Let m \u2265 3 be a positive integer and P a finite pattern with no m collinear points.\nFor every real \u03b5 > 0, there is N (\u03b5) > 0 such that for all n \u2265 N (\u03b5),\nSP (n, m) \u2265 n2\u2212\u03b5 .\nA proof of this conjecture cannot follow from Theorem 1, so such a proof will require a different\nway of constructing sets in general position and with many similar copies of the pattern P . On\n\u2226\nthe other hand, we believe that the construction in Theorem 10 for the function SP (n) is close to\noptimal. Here we believe that a stronger upper bound is needed.\nConjecture 2. Let P be a parallelogram-free pattern. For every real \u03b5 > 0, there is N (\u03b5) > 0 such\nthat for all n \u2265 N (\u03b5),\n\u2226\nSP (n) \u2264 n1+\u03b5 .\n\nReferences\n[1] B.
