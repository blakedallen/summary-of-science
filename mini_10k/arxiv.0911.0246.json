INTRODUCTION\n\nThe yields of baryons and antibaryons are an important indicator of the multiparticle production phenomenon in the ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions.\n\nGreat amount of experimental data have been obtained in such\n\nexperiments ranging from the AGS energies to the RHIC. The study of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions allows us to learn how baryon numbers initially\ncarried by the nucleons only (before the nuclear collision) are distributed in\nthe final state [1] in various baryonic states at the thermo-chemical freeze-out\nafter the collision. It is also possible to obtain important information about the\nenergy loss of the colliding nuclei by analyzing the rapidity dependence of the\n\u2212\n\np and\n\n\u2212\n\np production. The study of net proton (p \u2013 p ) and other hadron's\n\nrapidity spectra in such experiments can throw light on the collision scenario,\nnamely the extent of nuclear stopping/transparency, the subsequent formation\nof the hot and dense regions of hadronic matter (or fireballs) and the degree of\nthermo-chemical equilibration of various hadronic resonances. The degree of\nchemical equilibration of hadronic resonances can also be estimated by their\n\u2212\n\ncontributions to the lighter hadrons viz. p, p , K etc. via their decay. The\nexperimental data on the net proton flow at the AGS energy showed a peak at\nmidrapidity, while at the top SPS energy (\u221aSNN \u224817.2 GeV) the distribution\nstarted showing a minimum at midrapidity. The SPS data at different energies\n\u2212\n\n(20, 30, 40, 80, 158 GeV/A) show [1] that at midrapidity the p - p\n3\n\nyield\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\ndecreases gradually with increasing energy. This implies that at SPS energies\nthe nuclear collisions start exhibiting some transparency. Hence this new\nproperty namely the extended longitudinal scaling in the rapidity distributions\nhas emerged [2 - 5]. This has been observed in pp collisions at the highest RHIC\nenergies as well as ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions [5, 6]. Data from the\nBRAHMS collaboration [7] clearly show that the antiproton to proton ratio\nshows a maximum at midrapidity and gradually decreases towards larger\nrapidities, whereas the net proton flow shows a broad minimum, spanning\napproximately \u00b1 1 unit around the midrapidity region of dN/dy spectra. It was\ntherefore conjectured [7] that at RHIC energies the collisions are (at least\npartially) transparent. Though the midrapidity region at RHIC is not yet totally\nbaryon free however a transition from a baryon dominated system at lower\nenergies to an almost baryon free system in the midrapidity at RHIC can be\nobserved. An interesting analysis by Stiles and Murray [2, 8] shows that the\ndata obtained by the BRAHMS collaboration at 200 GeV/A has a clear\ndependence of the baryon chemical potential on rapidity which is revealed\n\u2212\n\nthrough the changing p/ p ratio with rapidity. Biedro\u0144 and Broniowski [2,9]\n\u2212\n\nhave also done an analysis of rapidity dependence of the p / p , K+/K-, \u03c0+/ \u03c0ratios based on a single freeze-out model of relativistic nuclear collisions. They\nhave used a single fireball model where the baryon chemical potential depends\non the spatial rapidity \u03b1\u2502\u2502 = arctanh(z/t) inside the fireball. They use single\ntemperature parameter for the entire fireball at the freeze-out (\u2248 165 MeV).\n4\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nTheir model is very successful in explaining the proton, antiproton and the\n(anti)Kaon rapidity spectra. They have used a parameterization for the\nfunctional dependence of the chemical potentials at low values of \u0399\u03b1\u2502\u2502\u0399 as \u03bc =\n\u03bc(0)[1 + A\n\n\u03b1 II2.4 ]. Here the power is chosen to be 2.4 instead of 2 which\n\naccording to these authors works better. Fu-Hu Liu et al. have [10] recently\nattempted to describe the transverse momentum spectrum and rapidity\ndistribution of net protons produced in such high energy nuclear collisions by\nusing a new approach viz. a two cylinder model [11 - 13].\n\n2. MODEL\n\nWe briefly discuss the model used here. In order to describe the rapidity\ndistribution of the produced hadrons in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions the\nstatistical thermal model has been extended to allow for the chemical\npotential and temperature to become rapidity dependent [5, 9, 14 - 16]. The\nmodel assumes that the rapidity axis is populated with hot regions (fireballs)\nmoving along the beam axis with increasing rapidity, yFB. The emitted particles\nleave these regions (fireballs) at the freeze-out following a (local) thermal\ndistribution. The resulting rapidity distribution of any given particle specie (say\njth) is then obtained by a superposition of the contributions of these regions\n(fireballs) as follows :\n\n5\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\ndN j ( y )\ndy\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n+ \u221e\n\n= A\n\n\u222b\u2212 \u221e\n\nj (y \u2212 y\nFB )\n\u03c1 ( y FB ) dN 1\ndy\n\ndy\n\n(1)\n\nFB\n\nwhere y is the particle's rapidity in the rest frame of the colliding nuclei and A\nis the overall normalization factor. The distribution\n\ndN j(y)\ndy\n\nrepresents total\n\ncontribution of all the regions to the jth hadron specie's rapidity spectra.\nAccording to the thermal model the single particle rapidity spectra of the\n\nhadrons in these local regions (fireballs) i.e.\n\ndN 1j\ndy\n\ndN 1j\ndy\n\ncan be written as :\n\n\uf8ee 2\n2moT 2\n2T 3 \uf8f9\n+\n\uf8fa\n2\u03c0g \u03bb \uf8efmoT +\nCoshy Cosh2 y \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\nj j\n\n=\n\ne \u2212 \u03b2moCoshy\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the fireball. The mo, g and \u03bbj are the rest mass,\nspin-isospin degeneracy factor and the fugacity of the jth hadronic specie,\nrespectively.\nHere the contribution of the respective regions to the final hadronic yields is\nnot assumed to be in the equal proportions. It is rather assumed to follow a\nGaussian distribution in the variable yFB, centred at zero fireball rapidity (yFB =\n0) :\n\n\u03c1 (yFB)\n\n\uf8eb\u2212 y2\n\uf8ec\nFB\nexp \uf8ec\n2\u03c0 \u03c3\n\uf8ec 2\u03c3 2\n\uf8ed\n1\n\n=\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\n6\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nThe value of \u03c3 determines the width of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore\nthe experimental data provide a strong evidence that the baryon chemical\npotential (\u03bcB) of the successive regions (fireballs) should be dependent on their\nrapidities (yFB). Hence the evaluation of the final hadronic yield requires a\nsuperposition of the contributions of all these regions (fireballs) whose baryon\nchemical potential increases with their rapidity. For this purpose a quadratic\ntype dependence is considered [2, 4], which also leaves the chemical potential\n(\u03bcB) invariant under the transformation yFB\n\n\u2192\n\n- yFB :\n\n2\n\n\u03bcB = a + b y FB\n\n(4)\n\nIn the recent works [5, 18] it has been further assumed that the temperature of\nthe successive fireballs along the rapidity axis decreases (as the baryon\nchemical potential increases) according to a chosen parameterization of the\nfollowing type :\n\nT = 0.166 \u2013 0.139\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\nB\n\n- 0.053\n\n\u03bc B4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the units are in GeV. Here the temperature of the mid-rapidity region\nof the fireball with yFB ~ 0 is fixed at T = (0.166 + 0.139 a2 \u2013 0.053 a4) GeV.\nBecattini and Cleymans [2, 4] provided a good fit to the net proton flow, pion\n\u2212\n\nflow and the ratio p / p , measured at the highest RHIC energy by the BRAHMS\ncollaboration. The values of their model parameters were, a = 23.8 MeV, b =\n7\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n11.2 MeV and \u03c3 = 2.183, while the temperature T varies according to the above\nparameterization (Eqn. 5). However a theoretical fit to the individual proton\nand antiproton rapidity spectra was not provided. Furthermore the strange\nsector data on Kaon and antiKaon rapidity spectra as measured by the BRAHMS\ncollaboration in the same experiment under the same experimental conditions\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nand the ratios \u039b / \u039b and \u039e / \u039e (from STAR) were also not tested.\nTherefore in this letter we have attempted to show that in addition to the net\n\u2212\n\nproton flow, pion flow and the ratio p / p the extended statistical thermal\nmodel discussed above can also very effectively explain the individual rapidity\nspectra of various non-strange and strange hadrons such as the protons,\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nantiprotons, Kaons, antiKaons, \u039b/ \u039b , and the \u039e/ \u039e . We find that the mid\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nrapidity data (for \u0399y\u0399 < 1) available (from STAR) on \u039b/ \u039b and \u039e/ \u039e are fitted\nquite well. This can be achieved with single set of model parameters viz. a, b,\n\u03c3 and single value of the temperature parameter T chosen for all the regions of\nthe dense hadronic matter (fireballs). The chemical potentials have to be made\ndependent on the fireball rapidity yFB, a situation which is unavoidable in the\nmodel due to the nature of the experimental data.\nWe have also investigated the contribution of the decay products of the heavy\nresonances [17] to the proton and antiproton rapidity distributions. The\nBRAHMS experimental data on the proton and antiproton also include the\ncontribution of the weak decays, mainly from the \u039b .\n\n8\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nThe spectrum of a decay product of a given parent hadron in the \"rest frame\nof the fireball\" can be written as [17] :\n\nd 3 n decay\n\n1\n=\n2 pE\n\nd3p\n\n\uf8eb d 3nh\n\uf8eb m h \uf8f6 E+\n\uf8ec\uf8ec * \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u222b dE h E h \uf8ec\uf8ec 3\n\uf8ed p \uf8f8 E\u2212\n\uf8ed d ph\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\nwhere p and E are respectively the momentum and energy of the product\nhadron in the rest frame of the fireball with\n\np = (E 2 \u2212 m2 )1/ 2 .

The two body decay\nkinematics gives the product hadron's momentum (p*) and energy (E*) in the\n\"rest frame of the decaying hadron\" as:\n\np * = ( E *2 \u2212 m 2 )1 / 2 ,\n*\n\nE =\n\nmh2 \u2212 mk2 + m2\n2mk\n\n(7)\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere mk indicates the mass of the other decay hadron produced along with the\none under consideration (having mass m).

It is done in a way such that the net\nstrangeness is zero not only on the overall basis but also in every region\n(fireball) separately. This is essential because as the rapidity yFB of these\nregions formed increases along the rapidity axis, the baryon chemical potential\n(\u03bcB) also increases. Hence the required value of the strange chemical potential\n(\u03bcS) varies accordingly with \u03bcB for a given value of temperature. Consequently\nthe value of the strange chemical potential (\u03bcS) varies with yFB.\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn figures 1 and 2 we have shown the experimental dN/dy data by the red solid\ncircles for the protons and antiprotons, respectively, obtained from the top 5%\nmost central collisions at \u221aSNN = 200 GeV in the BRAHMS experiment. The errors\nare both statistical and systematic. The experimental data are symmetrized for\nthe negative values of rapidity [7]. The proton's and antiproton's dN/dy data\nshow a maximum at midrapidity and decrease towards higher rapidities (y ~ 3).\nThe proton (antiproton) experimental data also include the contributions of the\nweakly decaying hyperons. Using the MC simulations BRAHMS have deduced\nthat there are 0.53 \u00b1 0.05 protons for each \u039b and 0.49 \u00b1 0.05 protons for each\n\n10\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n+\n\n\u03a3 decay. Here lambdas also include the contributions from other hyperons\n0\n\n-\n\n0\n\nthat decay to protons through their decays to \u039bs, i.e. \u03a3 , \u039e and \u039e [7]. The\nbranching ratio of the decay of these particles into lambda is \u2248 100%. We have\nconsidered all hadrons up to the mass 1530 MeV in full chemical equilibrium.\n\n28\n26\n\ndN/dy(Proton)\n\n24\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 1 : Proton rapidity spectra.

Theoretical result is shown by the solid curve\nwhile the red solid circles represent the experimental data points.\n\nWe have used the same normalization factor (Eqn. 1) A = 38.5 for all the\nbaryons and antibaryons. This also minimizes the value of (weighted) \u03a72/DoF of\nthe theoretical curves in figures 1 and 2. The minimum (weighted) \u03a72/DoF for\nthe fitted curves in figures 1 and 2 are 3.04 and 4.81, respectively. The\nsomewhat larger value for the case of antiproton is due to the small error bars.\n\n12\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nIt may be noted that the proton spectra (experimental as well as theoretical) in\nthe figure 1 is seen to be slightly broader than the antiproton spectra in figure\n2. This according to the present model seems to emerge from the fact that\n2 and the rapidity axis is assumed to be populated by the regions\nsince \u03bcB ~ y FB\n\n(fireballs) of successively increasing rapidity yFB\n\nand\n\nhence increasing\n\n2\n\nchemical potentials (since \u03bcB = a + b y FB ), consequently the low rapidity\n(y) baryons (which have a larger population in a baryon rich fireball in\nthermo-chemical equilibrium) emitted in the forward (backward) direction\nfrom a fast moving region (fireballs with large yFB), appear with a large value\nof rapidity (y) in the rest frame of the colliding nuclei. In other words as the\nbaryon chemical potentials (\u03bcB) increase monotonically along the rapidity axis\n2 ) there is an increase in the density of the protons and a simultaneous\n(~ y FB\n\nsuppression in the density of antiprotons thereby making the proton rapidity\nspectrum broader than that of the antiproton's.\nWe also compare these theoretical spectral shapes of the dN/dy distributions of\nprotons and antiprotons with the cases when resonance decay contributions are\nnot taken into account. In figures 3 and 4 we have shown the theoretical\nrapidity distributions of protons and antiprotons of pure thermal [17] origins,\nrespectively. The pure thermal yield is the one which does not include the\nresonance decay contributions, as discussed above. This is shown by the red\ncurves. We also show again the total proton and antiproton distributions by\n\n13\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\ngreen curves (i.e. including the resonance decays, as shown in figures 1 and 2\nalso).\n\n0.8\n\ndN/dy (Proton)\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 3 : Rapidity spectra of pure thermal protons (i.e. excluding the resonance decay\ncontributions) is shown by red curve and that of the total protons is shown by\ngreen curve (i.e. including the resonance decays). For the sake of proper\ncomparison of the spectral shapes the two curves are normalized at y = 0. The\nunits are arbitrary here.\n\nTo facilitate a proper comparison the curves have been normalized at y = 0 in\nboth the figures, where the units are arbitrary. We notice that the spectral\nshapes for the case when resonance decay contributions are taken into account\nare (slightly) narrower than the spectral shape of the protons of the pure\nthermal origin, while for the case of antiprotons (figure 4) the two curves\nalmost overlap. Hence we find no major change of rapidity spectral shape due\nto resonance contributions.\n\n14\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n0.5\n\ndN/dy(Antiproton)\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 4 : Rapidity spectra of pure thermal antiprotons (i.e. excluding the resonance decay\ncontributions) shown by red curve and that of the total antipro tons is shown by\ngreen curve (i.e. including the resonance decays). For the sake of proper\ncomparison of the spectral shapes the two curves are normalized at y = 0. The\nunits are arbitrary here.\n\nIn order to highlight this further we have in figure 5 plotted the ratio of the\ntwo (i.e. total protons versus pure thermal protons) with the rapidity. We find\nthat the ratio is nearly constant between y = 0 to y \u2248 3. The values represent\nthe actual results of the calculations.\nThe variation in the ratio between these limits of the rapidity variable is < 6%.\nThe corresponding ratio for the case of antiprotons will be almost constant.\n\n15\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\ndN/dy(Total Protons/ Thermal Protons)\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 5 : Ratio of the total protons versus pure thermal protons plotted with rapidity. The\nvalues represent the actual results.\n\nWe have found that nearly 66% protons (antiprotons) are of the pure thermal\norigin. This agrees with the experimental situation within the limits of\nstatistical and systematic errors [7].\nThe slight narrowness in the spectral shape of the total protons is due to the\nrelative narrowness in the rapidity distributions of the heavier baryons such as\n\n\u039b, \u03a3, \u039e compared to the lighter particles i.e. protons.\nTo realize this we have shown in figure 6 the rapidity distributions of pure\nthermal p, \u039b, \u03a3, and \u039e. We have normalized these curves at y = 0 for the sake\nof comparison of the spectral shapes.\n\n16\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\nThermal Lambda And Sigma\ndN/dy\n\n0.4\n\nThermal P\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nThermal Cascade\n\n0.1\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 6 : Rapidity distributions of pure thermal p, \u039b, \u03a3, and \u039e. For a proper comparison of\nthe spectral shapes we have normalized these curves at y = 0.\n\nWe see that the spectral shape of \u039e is narrower than that of the proton's and\nlambda's (sigma's) for the given values of the parameters a, b, \u03c3 and T, while\nthe curves of lambdas and sigmas overlap, since their masses are not much\ndifferent. In figure 7 we have plotted the ratio of pure thermal cascades and\nlambdas with rapidity. We find that the ratio does not vary significantly\nbetween y = 0 and y \u2248 3. The values are the actual result of the theoretical\ncalculations.\n\n17\n\n\fdN/dy (Thermal Cascade / Thermal lambda)\n\nSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 7 : Ratio of pure thermal Cascades and lambdas.

The two curves in figure 8a are again normalized to enable a\nproper comparison of the spectral shapes. In figure 8b we have shown the\nrapidity spectra of the pure thermal Cascades in the extended statistical model\nand that of the lambdas obtained through its decay. The two curves in figure\n8b are normalized to enable a proper comparison of the spectral shapes.\nWe therefore conclude that the rapidity spectra of the product hadrons are\nonly slightly narrower than those of the parent hadrons.\n\n0 .0 7\n\nD e c a y L a m b d a fro m C a s c a d e\n\n0 .0 6\n\ndN/dy\n\n0 .0 5\n\nT h e rm a l C a s c a d e\n\n0 .0 4\n0 .0 3\n0 .0 2\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nR a p id ity (y )\n\nFig. 8b : Rapidity distribution shapes of the pure thermal cascades and that of the\nLambdas obtained through its decay.

The solid curve represents the result of our calculation while\n19\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nthe solid red circles represent the BRAHMS experimental data. The value of the\nminimum (weighted) \u03a72/DoF for the fitted curve is 3.12. We have again used\nthe same normalization factor i.e. 38.51 for all baryons and antibaryons. We\nfind that in our theoretical calculation the net baryon number NB \u2248 2.18 Np,\nwhere Np is the theoretically calculated net proton number. This is in close\nagreement with the BRAHMS estimate where they have suggested NB \u2248 (2.03 \u00b1\n0.08) Np,meas, where . Np,meas is the experimentally measured net proton number.\nThe experimental net proton flow distribution data shows a somewhat broad\nand deep minimum around the mid-rapidity region which is well described by\nthe theoretical solid curve in figure 9. This experimental situation is however\nnot as it was widly expected [19] that the rapidity distribution of the net\nbaryons produced in the ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions will exhibit a very\nflat and broad minimum measuring several units of rapidity, centred at\nmidrapidity. So far it has not been observed, either in the SPS experiments or\neven at the highest RHIC energy. The future LHC/ALICE experiments may throw\nmore light on this aspect and provide a better understanding of the nuclear\ntransparency effect in the ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions.\nThe present RHIC experiments at 200 GeV/A however have given an indication\nthat these nuclear collisions have begun to show at least partial transparency.\n\n20\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n18\n16\n\ndN/dy (p - pbar)\n\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 9 : Rapidity spectra of the net proton flow.

We have included the resonance\ndecay contributions. The value of the minimum (weighted) \u03a72/DoF for the\ncurve is 1.06.\n\n21\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n1.0\n\ndN/dy (pbar / p)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\n\u2212\n\nFig. 10 : Rapidity spectra of p/ p ratio.

We have found that in the extended\nstatistical thermal model it is possible to account fully for the rapidity\ndistributions of Kaons and antiKaons also.\nIn figure 11 we have shown the rapidity spectra of Kaon flow. The theoretical\ncurve which fits the data is for the same values of the model parameters as\nused for the theoretical curves in all previous figures 1-10. We find that the\ntheoretical curve provides a very good fit to the data. Here it is noteworthy\n\n22\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nthat the BRAHMS experimental data of Kaons and antiKaons used here have\nbeen corrected for the decay contributions. Hence in our calculations we have\n*\n\nnot included the contribution of the strong K \u2192 K\u03c0 decay. The \u03a72/DoF for the\nfitted curve is 0.70.\n\n50\n45\n\ndN/dy (Kaon)\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRapidity (y)\n\nFig. 11 : Rapidity spectra of Kaon flow.

The theoretical\ncurve which fits the data is again for the same values of the model parameters.\nHere once again we notice that the Kaon spectra is broader than the antiKaon\nspectra as is also noticed for the proton spectra which is broader than the\nantiproton spectra. This is again due to the increasing chemical potential of the\nsuccessive regions (fireballs) formed along the rapidity axis. The \u03a72/DoF for the\n\n23\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nfitted curve is 4.69.

The theoretical curves are for the same values of the model parameters\nas the ones used for protons, antiprotons, Kaons and antiKaons.\nIn figure 15 we have shown the theoretical fit to the pion's experimental data.\nThe pion spectrum is also fitted for the same values of the model parameters\nas used in other cases. Here it is again important to note that the BRAHMS have\ncorrected these pion experimental data also for any feed down contributions\nfrom heavier resonances including decaying baryons like \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e. Hence this\nfacilitates a direct comparison of the pion experimental data with the\ncalculated abundance of the pions of the pure thermal origin (i.e. excluding\nthe decay contributions). It should be realized that under such a situation the\npion rapidity spectrum is then sensitive only to the two model parameters,\nwhich are T and \u03c3. The values of \"a\" and \"b\" have no role to play whatsoever\nin determining the pion's spectra here, since the parameters \"a\" and \"b\" are\nused to fix the baryon chemical potential in the different regions (fireballs)\nand the experimental data does not include the decay contributions of baryons\nand heavier mesons (K* etc). Consequently these parameters do not govern the\nabundance of the pions of the pure thermal origin. The \u03a72/DoF for the fitted\ncurve is 6.5, which is somewhat high due to the small error bars in the\nexperimental data. The normalization factor A for this case turns out to be \u2248\n97.5.\nWe notice that in the present model the normalization factors are not same for\nall the particle species. We find that for baryons it is \u2248 38.5, for (anti)Kaons\nit is \u2248 45.6 while for pions it turns out to be \u2248 97.5. However, in the present\n26\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n300\n\ndN/dy (Pion)\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nR ap id ity (y)\n\nFig. 15 : Rapidity spectra of pion flow. The theoretical result is shown by the solid\ncurve.\n\nanalysis the actual emphasis is on the capability of the model to reproduce the\nshape of the rapidity distributions, and this is fitted here for each particle\nspecie.\nFinally in figure 16 we have shown the variation of the \u03bcS with yFB. The value of\n\u03bcS is determined by applying the strangeness conservation criteria for a given\n2\nvalue of yFB , which fixes \u03bcB since \u03bcB = a + b y FB\n. It is seen to first rise smoothly\n\nwith yFB reaching a maximum value of about 30 MeV at around yFB ~ 5 and then\ndrops rapidly to very small values as yFB ~ 8 (i.e. when \u03bcB \u2248 800 MeV) and\nbeyond this will become negative.\n\n27\n\n\fRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\n\u03bcs(MeV)\n\nSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nyFB\nFig. 16 : The variation of the \u03bcS with yFB for T = 175.0 MeV.\n\nIn summary, we use an earlier proposed extended thermal model, where\nformation of several hot regions (or fireballs) moving with increasing rapidity\n(yFB) along the beam axis is assumed. The final state hadrons are assumed to be\nemitted from these fireball regions. A Gaussian profile in yFB is used to weigh\nthe contributions of these regions to the final state emitted hadron's\npopulation. A quadratic profile in yFB is used to fix the baryon chemical\npotentials of these regions (fireballs). We find that it is possible to explain not\n\u2212\n\nonly the net proton, p / p and pion flow but also the individual proton,\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nantiproton, Kaon, antiKaon, \u039b/ \u039b and the \u039e/ \u039e rapidity spectra as well. It is\ninteresting to find that the model can successfully explain the strange sector\ndata also quite well, measured in the same experiment by the BRAHMS and the\nSTAR collaboration. This is achieved by using single set of the model\nparameters. We also study the effect of the resonance decay products on the\n\n28\n\n\fSaeed Uddin et. al.\n\nRapidity Spectra of hadrons ....\n\nrapidity spectra of the hadrons. We find that the rapidity spectra of the decay\nproducts are slightly narrower than that of the parent hadron's. The pure\nthermal rapidity distribution of the heavier particle species is seen to be\nnarrower than those of the lighter paticles.\n\nAuthors are grateful to Professors J. Cleymans and F.
