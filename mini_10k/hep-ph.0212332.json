We\nalso discuss whether such stable Fermi Balls may contribute to the cold dark matter.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Yv, 95.35.+d\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn quantum field theory and especially in the cosmological context, various models have\nbeen discussed where the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry produces domain\nwalls [1, 2]. If the symmetry is approximate and broken spontaneously in the history of the\nexpanding universe, the false vacuum regions shrink due to the energy density difference\n[3] and this process is accelerated by the surface tension. The shrinking will stop before\ncollapsing if there exist zero mode solutions for the fermions bound in such domain walls\n[4, 5] and the Fermi pressure of such fermions becomes comparable to the shrinking force\ndue to the surface tension and the volume energy. These objects, a kind of non-topological\nsolitons, are called Fermi Balls [6] and introduced as a candidate for cold dark matter [6, 7].\nThey were also suggested in the baryon-separation scenario with the QCD energy scale [8].\nHowever, the stability of the Fermi Balls which should be essential to be a candidate for\ncold dark matter has not been fully examined.\nWe consider in this paper the stability of the thin-wall Fermi Balls against the fragmentation. The Fermi Ball, if it is electrically neutral as was firstly proposed [6], is unstable\nagainst the fragmentation, when the domain wall thickness \u03b4b can be neglected in comparison with the Fermi Ball radius R. In the previous paper [9], we estimated the corrections\ncaused by the finite \u03b4b effect (corresponding to the curvature effect of the domain wall), and\nfound that the neutral Fermi Ball is unstable even if the curvature effect is included. Though\nthe electrically charged Fermi Ball introduced by Morris [10] has the stability against the\ndeformation from the spherical shape [9, 10], they are metastable [9] and not absolutely\nstable against the fragmentation. We do not discuss the charged Fermi Ball in the present\npaper.\nIn the above discussions, though, the thickness \u03b4f of the distribution of the fermions\nconfined in the wall is much less than the wall thickness \u03b4b and can be neglected. This\napproximation is valid only for the case where the fermions are tightly bound to the domain\nwall. We in this paper consider the case where \u03b4f cannot be neglected. In order to estimate the corrections caused by the finite \u03b4f effect, we use the perturbation approximation\nexpanding the scalar field \u03c6, the fermion field \u03c8 and the static energy of the Fermi Ball E\nin the power of \u03b4b /R. We examine the stability of the Fermi Ball against the fragmentation\nat each level of the perturbation.\n2\n\n\fThe contents of the present paper are organized as follows: We first explain the neutral\nFermi Ball model to clarify terminologies and method of energy estimation in Sec.II. We\nnext examine the stability of the Fermi Ball within the leading (zeroth) order of \u03b4b /Rperturbation but with finite \u03b4f in Sec.III, and regain the result obtained in the previous\nworks in the limit \u03b4f \u2192 0 [6]. The effect of the finite \u03b4f in the higher order corrections\nof \u03b4b /R-perturbation is investigated in Sec.IV. We discuss constraints on the Fermi Ball\nparameters from the experimental viewpoint in Sec.V. We summarize the obtained results\nin Sec.VI.\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD FOR ESTIMATING FERMI BALL ENERGY\n\nWe consider the simple model with the Lagrangian density,\n1\nL = (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + \u03a8(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 G\u03c6)\u03a8 \u2212 U(\u03c6) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the scalar potential U(\u03c6) is approximately double-well shaped,\nU(\u03c6) =\n\n\u03bb 2\n(\u03c6 \u2212 v 2 )2 + \u2206(\u03c6) .\n8\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the first term has the Z2 symmetry under \u03c6 \u2194 \u2212\u03c6, and the second term violates the\nsymmetry though it is assumed to be much smaller than the first one, \u039b \u2243 |\u2206(v)\u2212\u2206(\u2212v)| \u226a\n\n\u03bbv 4 . Supposing \u2206(\u2212v) > \u2206(v), we call the region with \u03c6 = v and that with \u03c6 = \u2212v as the\ntrue vacuum and the false vacuum, respectively. In the following, we neglect the second term\nexcept for the explicit discussion in Sec.VI.

Since the energy of the\nFermi Ball in the leading order approximation is proportional to the total fermion number,\nthe two states have the same energy. The leading order estimation cannot tell whether the\nFermi Balls with large Nf produced in the early universe survive until now or not [24].

Taking into account Eq.(32) and \u2206Ef , the second term in\nthe r.h.s. of Eq.(27), we obtain the Fermi Ball energy in the next-to-leading order,\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nE2 = Ef + Eb + \u2206Ef = C(\u03bb, G)v .\n\n(52)\n\nWe see that C(\u03bb, G) does not depend on Nf ; this is crucial to the discussion on the stability\nof the Fermi Ball below. Let us consider a single-Fermi Ball state and a n-Fermi Balls state\nboth with the total fermion number taken to be Nf . The two states have the same leadingorder energies E0 , while they have the different higher-order corrections E2 : the former\nhas a correction Cv and the latter nCv. Therefore, when C is positive, the former state\nhas the lower energy and the Fermi Ball is stable against the fragmentation. We evaluate\nE2 numerically and find that C(\u03bb, G) is positive in a limited parameter region of \u03bb and G\n(see FIG.3). We see in FIG.3 that rather large value of G is allowed for the Fermi Ball\nto be stable. This situation, however, is much changed if the fermions have more degrees\nof freedom, e.g., belonging to a large multiplet of the internal symmetry and if the scalar\n11\n\n\f10\n\nG\n\n\u03952 = 0\nStable region\n\u03952 > 0\n\n1\n0.001\n\n\u03952 < 0\nUnstable region\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: The region of the scalar self-coupling constant \u03bb and the Yukawa coupling constant G\nwhere the neutral Fermi Ball is stable (shadowed region) or unstable (blank region) against the\nfragmentation. The energy E2 in the figure denotes the deviation from the leading order energy\nof the Fermi Ball obtained within the thin-wall analysis. We see that rather large value of G is\nallowed for the Fermi Ball to be stable (see also FIG.4 and its caption).\n\nfield \u03c6 belongs to a singlet (see the forthcoming paper). Consider the fermion multiplet \u03a8i\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) coupling to \u03c6 through the common Yukawa coupling constant G, and assume\nfor simplicity the fermion number Ni = N in common for each flavor i. In such a case, we\nsee that the energy correction E2 is independent of N but depends on n, and that a smaller\nvalue of G can stabilize the Fermi Ball (see FIG.4). Here, we emphasize that there is a\ncertain region of the parameters where stable Fermi Balls are allowed to exist.\n\n12\n\n\f10\n\nn=1\n\nG\n\nn=3\nn = 10\n\n1\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: The allowed region (shadowed) of the scalar self-coupling constant \u03bb and the Yukawa\ncoupling constant G for the Fermi Ball with multi-fermions \u03a8i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) to be stable against the\nfragmentation (see text). The allowed region is illustrated for n = 1, 3 and 10. The figure shows\nthat the region extends as n is increases.\nV.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL OR OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON REGION OF\n\nPARAMETERS\n\nWe very roughly examine here cosmological or observational constraints on the parameter\nregion for the neutral Fermi ball. We define the parameter \u03ba = 2\u03c0 1/3 \u03bb1/6 v which satisfies\nMf = \u03ba3 R2 ,\n\n(53)\n\nwith the Fermi ball mass Mf and the radius R being given by Eq.(33) and Eq.(32), respectively.\nWe first consider the energy density difference \u039b which we have neglected so far. We\nknow that \u039b should be larger than the critical value \u039bc \u2243 \u03ba6 /(144\u03c0 2Mpl2 ) in order to avoid\nthe domination of the black holes made up by domain walls in the total energy density of\nthe early universe [11]. Such a finite \u039b gives a volume energy Ev = 4\u03c0\u039bR3 /3 to the false\n13\n\n\fvacuum, having an effect to destabilize the Fermi Ball. As far as the volume energy is small\n3/2\n\nenough, i.e., Ev = 4\u03c0\u039bMf /(3\u03ba9/2 ) < E2 , the Fermi Ball is absolutely stable. This gives a\nconstraint,\nMf < 2.9 \u00d7 10\n\n26\n\n\u0012\n\nGeV\n\u03ba\n\n\u0013 31 \u0012\n\nE2\n\u03ba\n\n\u0013 32\n\nGeV ,\n\n(54)\n\ndue to the condition for \u039b to exist under the above constraints.\nWe next consider the observational aspect of the neutral Fermi ball. If they are produced in the early universe and have survived until present, they can contribute to the dark\nmatter in the Galaxy. Let us assume here that the neutral stable Fermi ball has a sizable\ncontribution to dark matter. We then have their flux F ,\nGeV\n\u03c1DM u0\n\u223c 7.1 \u00d7 105\nF \u2243\n4\u03c0Mf\nMf\n\n!\n\ncm\u22122 sec\u22121 sr\u22121 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u03c1DM \u223c 0.3 GeV cm\u22123 is the energy density of the dark matter in the Galaxy and\nu0 \u223c 3 \u00d7 107 cm sec\u22121 is the Virial velocity of the Fermi ball. We seek for the allowed region\n\nof the Fermi ball parameters through the use of currently available observational data. We\nuse in the following the results of the experiments which searched for monopoles or heavy\ndark matter.\nIn order to examine whether the Fermi ball can be detected in terrestrial experiments,\nwe first consider the condition that the neutral Fermi ball should reach the detector passing\nthrough matter. The energy loss rate (energy loss per path length) is given by [12, 13]\ndE\n= \u2212\u03c3u2 \u03c1 ,\ndx\n\n(56)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the collision cross section with a nucleus in the medium, u is the velocity of the\nFermi ball, and \u03c1 is the density of the target matter. For simplicity, in the following we\nassume that the cross section is geometrically given by,\n\u03c3 = \u03c0R2 .\n\n(57)\n\nFrom Eq.(56), the velocity u decreases exponentially with the path length, \u221d\nexp(\u2212\u03c3\u03c1x/Mf ). Estimating the final velocity as uc \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 104 cm sec\u22121 [13], we obtain the\ncondition for the Fermi ball to reach the detector,\nMf > 0.13\u03c3\u03c1L ,\n\n14\n\n(58)\n\n\fwhere L is the path length. Substituting Eqs.(53) and (57) into Eq.(58) yields\n\u03ba > 4.6 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u03c1L\ngr cm\u22122\n\n!1/3\n\nGeV .\n\n(59)\n\nWe next consider the efficiency of the detectors to observe the neutral Fermi ball. Let us\nexamine the track detectors with mica [15] and the scintillators in the MACRO [17] and the\nKEK [19] experiments. These experiments are sensitive to the neutral Fermi ball, if the energy loss per path length is large enough, q(dE/\u03c1dx) > (dE/\u03c1dx)min , where (dE/\u03c1dx)min is\nthe detection threshold for relativistic charged particles and q is the efficiency correction factor. This condition with Eq.(56) gives \u03c3 > 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221218 [q \u22121 (dE/\u03c1dx)min /GeV/gr cm\u22122 ] cm2 ,\nthat is,\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03ba\n\u03c3\u03ba3\n> 1.4 \u00d7 109\nMf =\n\u03c0\nGeV\n\n\u00133 \"\n\nq \u22121 (dE/\u03c1dx)min\nGeV/gr cm\u22122\n\n#\n\nGeV .\n\n(60)\n\nFor the scintillator experiments in MACRO and KEK we take q = 1 for simplicity [25].\nIn case of the MACRO experiments, the conditions Eq.(59) and Eq.(60) with \u03c1L = 3.7 \u00d7\n105 gr cm\u22122 and q \u22121 (dE/\u03c1dx)min \u223c 3Imin \u223c 6 MeV/gr cm\u22122 [17] give \u03ba > 3.3 GeV and\n\nMf > 7.8 \u00d7 106 (\u03ba/GeV)3 GeV. The flux upper limit of F < 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 sr\u22121 with\n\nEq.(55) gives the mass lower limit Mf > 2.8 \u00d7 1021 GeV. In case of the KEK experiments,\n\nthe conditions \u03c1L = 103 gr cm\u22122 and q \u22121 (dE/\u03c1dx)min \u223c 0.01Imin \u223c 20 KeV/gr cm\u22122\n\n[17] give \u03ba > 0.46 GeV and Mf > 2.6 \u00d7 104 (\u03ba/GeV)3 GeV. The flux bound F < 3.2 \u00d7\n\n10\u221211 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 sr\u22121 gives Mf > 2.2 \u00d7 1016 GeV.\n\nFor the truck detector with mica [15] we also take q = 1 for simplicity. In this case we\ntake \u03c1L = 7.5 \u00d7 105 gr cm\u22122 which is due to the fact that the mica was located at 3 km deep\n\nunder the earth, and q \u22121 (dE/\u03c1dx)min \u223c 2.4 GeV/gr cm\u22122 [15]. They give \u03ba > 4.2 GeV and\nMf > 3.1 \u00d7 109 (\u03ba/GeV)3 GeV. The flux upper limit F < 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221220 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 sr\u22121 gives\nMf > 3.1 \u00d7 1025 GeV.\n\nRecently very low background experiments are being done for the dark matter search\n[16, 21, 22]. Here, we analyze the results of CDMS experiments, which uses cryogenic Ge\ndetector. The condition Eq.(59) with \u03c1L = 2.6 \u00d7 103 gr cm\u22122 gives \u03ba > 1.2 GeV. The\ndark matter search experiments allow such a small cross section of the cold dark matter\nparticle scattering with the target nucleus that the average number of collisions in the\ntarget is less than a unity (\u03c3\u03c1d/mGe \u223c \u03c3\u03c1d/AGe mp < 1, namely, \u03c3 < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221223 cm2\n\nwith \u03c1 = 5.3 gr/cm3 , d = 1cm and AGe \u223c 73). The experimental results are roughly\n15\n\n\fexpressed as F \u03c3 \u221d \u03c3/Mf < 3 \u00d7 AGe \u00d7 10\u221242 cm2 /GeV for Mf > 100 GeV, and this gives\n\n\u03ba > 3.9 \u00d7 104 GeV.\n\nWe illustrate the allowed region of Mf and \u03ba in Figure 5. In this figure the condition for\n\nFIG. 5: The allowed regions (blank) of the Fermi ball mass Mf and the quantity \u03ba defined by\n\u03ba = 2\u03c0 1/3 \u03bb1/6 v where \u03bb is the scalar self-coupling constant and v is the symmetry breaking scale.\nThe upper shadowed region is excluded by the stability condition. The other shadowed regions are\nexcluded by the experiments MACRO [17], KEK [19], MICA [15] and CDMS [16]. We take q = 1\nfor simplicity (see text).\n\nthe stability Eq.(54) is also shown. One can see that there still remains the parameter region\n> 105 GeV for Mf < 1025 GeV and \u03ba < 105 GeV\nto be explored, especially the region of \u03ba \u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\n25\n27\n< Mf < 10 GeV.\nfor 10 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have considered the neutral Fermi Balls in the thin-wall model where the domain wall\nthickness \u03b4b is much smaller than the Fermi Ball radius R. In the case where the spreading\nthickness \u03b4f of the fermion confined in the domain wall is negligibly small compared to \u03b4b ,\nthe Fermi Ball is unstable against the fragmentation even if the finite \u03b4b is taken into account\n[9]. In the present paper, we have examined whether the Fermi Ball is stable or not if the\n16\n\n\feffect of the finite \u03b4f is included.\nIn order to estimate the energy of the Fermi Ball, we have expanded the fields and the\nHamiltonian in the power of \u03b4b /R. At each level of the perturbation, we have examined the\nstability against the fragmentation. We have found that the energy correction in the nextto-leading order can stabilize the Fermi Ball in the limited region of the scalar self-coupling\nconstant \u03bb and the Yukawa coupling constant G, as is shown in FIG.3.\nWe have lastly given rough estimations for the allowed region of the parameters, Mf and\n\u03ba, for the neutral Fermi Ball to have a sizable contribution to the cold dark matter in case\nwhere the cross section of the Fermi Ball scattering with matter is of geometrical size. We\nhave found that the allowed region is severely restricted by cosmological or observational\nconstraints, but that there still remains the region open to the future exploration.\nIn the present paper, we have dealt with the Fermi Ball in a semi-classical manner.\nThe quantum corrections, such as the radiative correction coming from the scattering of\nthe fermions in the domain wall, may affect the stability of the Fermi Ball. They will be\ndiscussed elsewhere.\n\n[1] T. W. B. Kibble, J. Phys. A9 (1976) 1387.\n[2] A. Vilenkin, Phys. Rep. 121 (1985) 263.\n[3] G. B. Gelmini, M. Gleiser and E. W. Kolb, Phys. Rev.
