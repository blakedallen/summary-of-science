Prominent non-Gaussian tails are observed in the pion pair transverse momentum\n(outward) and in the beam (longitudinal) directions. Model calculations reproduce them with the\nassumption of Bjorken longitudinal boost invariance and transverse flow blast-wave dynamics; they\nalso yield a proper time for breakup and emission duration for the pion source.\nPACS numbers: PACS 25.75.Ld\n\nOver the last several decades, the expansion dynamics and breakup lifetime for the exotic matter produced\nin relativistic heavy ion (RHI) collisions, have been of\nparamount interest [1, 2]. Such enormous energy den-\n\nsities are created in the RHI collision zone, that deconfinement of nuclear matter is expected [3]. To gain an\nunderstanding of this state of matter, it is essential to\nstudy its dynamical evolution. The space-time extent of\n\n\f2\nhot particle emission sources in heavy ion collisions has\nbeen studied for years via final-state correlations between\ntwo particles [4].\nYears ago, pioneering work at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) [5] and by the NA49 Collaboration at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [6],\nexploited the Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) correlations\nof hadron pairs in conjunction with fits to particle spectra, to estimate the dynamical properties of the reaction\nsource in a blast wave model.\nThe NA49 data for cen\u221a\ntral Pb+Pb collisions at sN N = 17.3 GeV indicated a\nstrong longitudinal flow with an approximately boost invariant longitudinal velocity profile. These data also suggested a transverse expansion of the pion emission source\nwith a duration of 8-9 fm/c. A more recent analysis [7]\nconfirms these earlier findings while extending the beam\nenergy dependence of the measurements to five separate\nSPS energies.\nSeveral years ago, an alternative technique based on\nsource imaging was introduced for model-independent\nextraction of emission sources in the pair-center-of-mass\nsystem (PCMS) [8, 9, 10]. This new methodology has\nprovided a more faithful and detailed extraction of the\nactual 1D source function [11, 12]. Recent theoretical\ndevelopments [13, 14, 15, 16] enable the extraction of\nthree-dimensional (3D) profiles of the emission source.\nThis methodology, in both its 1D and 3D\n\u221a forms,\nhas been employed for Au+Au reactions at sN N =\n200 GeV to obtain detailed information on both the spatial and the lifetime extents of the created emission source\n[12, 17]. Here, we use the new methodology to again\nstudy reaction dynamics at the SPS but with identified\npion correlations and extensively developed imaging techniques that explicitly include Coulomb effects and do not\nassume Gaussian sources. The resulting non-Gaussian\nsource functions are interpreted in the context of a powerful new simulation model, THERMINATOR [18, 19, 20].\nThis approach explicitly includes all known resonance decays, longitudinal expansion, transverse expansion and a\nfreeze-out hypersurface.\nIn this study, the source imaging technique is used to\nanalyze NA49 Collaboration\ndata for central (0 \u2212 7%)\n\u221a\nPb+Pb collisions at sN N = 17.3 GeV, obtained at the\nSPS. Model comparisons allow tests of different aspects\nof the dynamics and, in particular, the extraction of the\nproper time for breakup and emission duration for the\npion emission source. The picture that emerges has many\nsimilarities to that from the early work [6, 7], but also\nadds interesting features and conclusions that preclude\ndirect comparison.\nThe data presented here were taken by the NA49 Collaboration during the years 1996-2000. Lead beams of\n158A GeV from the CERN SPS accelerator were made\nincident on a lead foil of thickness 224 mg/cm2 . Details of the experimental setup are discussed in Refs.[7]\nand [21]. Briefly, the NA49 Large Acceptance Hadron\n\nDetector achieves precision tracking and particle identification using four large Time Projection Chambers\n(TPCs). The first two of them are mounted in precisely\nmapped magnetic fields with total bending power of up\nto 9 Tm. Charged particles are detected by the tracks left\nin the TPCs and are identified by the energy deposited in\nthe TPC gas. Mid-rapidity particle identification is further enhanced by a time-of-flight wall (resolution 60 ps).\nCharged particle momenta are determined from the deflection in the magnetic field. With the NA49 setup,\na resolution of \u03b4p/p2 \u2248 (0.3 \u2212 7) \u00d7 10\u22124 (GeV/c)\u22121 is\nachieved. Event centrality is determined by a forward\nveto calorimeter which measures the energy of spectator\nmatter. Approximately 3.9 million central events were\nanalyzed.\nThe 3D correlation function, C(q), and its 1D angleaveraged counterpart C(q), were obtained as the ratio\nof pair to uncorrelated reference distributions in relative momentum q, for \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 pairs. Here,\n2)\nis half of the momentum difference between\nq = (p1 \u2212p\n2\nthe two particles in the PCMS, and q is the modulus\nof the vector q. The pair distribution was obtained by\npairing particles from the same event; the uncorrelated\ndistribution was obtained by pairing particles from different events. The Lorentz transformation of q from the\nlaboratory frame to the PCMS is made by a transformation to the longitudinally co-moving system (LCMS)\nframe along the beam direction followed by a transformation to the PCMS along the pair transverse momentum\n[22]. C(q) is observed to be flat for 50 < q < 100 MeV/c\nand is normalized to unity over this range.\nMid-rapidity (|yL \u2212y0 | <0.35, where yL and y0 are particle and nucleus-nucleus centre-of-mass rapidities in the\nlaboratory frame), low kT (kT < 70 MeV/c, where kT is\nhalf the transverse component of the pair total momentum) \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 pion pairs were selected for this\nstudy. Track merging and splitting effects were removed\nby appropriate cuts on both the pair and uncorrelated\ndistributions. The merging cut required the two particles in a pair to be separated by at least 2.2 cm over 50\npad rows in the vertex TPCs [7]. A 20% increase in this\nminimum separation has resulted only in changes within\nthe statistical errors. Similar evaluations for the other\ncuts indicate an overall systematic uncertainty which is\ncomparable to or smaller than the statistical uncertainty.\nThe effects of track momentum resolution were assessed by jittering the momenta of the tracks in the data\nby the maximum momentum resolution, \u03b4p/p2 \u2248 7\u00d710\u22124\n(GeV/c)\u22121 . The resulting re-computed 1D and 3D correlation functions, which incorporate twice the effect of\nthe momentum resolution, were found to be consistent\nwith those obtained without momentum smearing. The\ncorrelation functions without additional smearing serve\nin the following as a basis for the extraction of source\nfunctions via imaging and fitting.\nThe imaging procedure employed uses the 1D imaging\n\n\f3\n\nis qualitatively similar to that reported for RHIC data\nin Ref.[12]. As a check, the extracted source function is\nused as input to Eq. (1) to obtain a restored correlation\nfunction also shown in Fig. 1(a); excellent consistency is\nobserved.\nIn parallel to the imaging procedure, two different\nfunctional forms were used to fit the measured correlation function directly, as discussed below. The conclusion from the fits (see Fig. 1) is that a triaxial Gaussian,\nfrequently termed ellipsoid, as used in traditional HBT\nmethodology, poorly describes the correlation function at\nlow q >\n13 MeV/c (Fig. 1(a)), and this leads to a devia\u223c\ntion from the tail of the imaged source function for large\nr>\n15 fm (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(c) highlights the fact that\n\u223c\nthe tail for r >\n15 fm contains a very significant fraction\n\u223c\nof the source. On the other hand, the Hump function\n(cf. Eq. (7) and discussion below) gives a good fit over a\nmore extensive range.\nFor systematic access to the 3D source function S(r),\nthe 3D correlation function C(q) and source function\nS(r) were both expanded in a series with correlation\nl\nmoments R\u03b1\n(q) and source moments S\u03b1l 1 ...\u03b1l (r) in\n1 ...\u03b1l\na Cartesian harmonic basis representation:\nX X\nl\nR\u03b1\n(q) Al\u03b11 ...\u03b1l (\u03a9q ),\nC(q) \u2212 1 = R(q) =\n1 ...\u03b1l\nl\n\n\u03b11 ...\u03b1l\n\n(2)\n\nS(r) =\n\nX X\nl\n\n\u03b11 ...\u03b1l\n\nS\u03b1l 1 ...\u03b1l (r) Al\u03b11 ...\u03b1l (\u03a9r ),\n\n(3)\n\n0<kT<70 MeV/c\n|yL-y0|<0.35\n\nC(q)\n\n1.15\n\n1D C(q)\n0\n\n1+R (q)\nImaging\nHump Fit\nEllipsoid Fit\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nq (MeV/c)\n(b)\n\n-3\n\nwhich relates the two-particle angle-averaged 1D correlation function, C(q), to the 1D source function or image,\nS(r). The latter gives the probability of emitting a pair of\nparticles with a separation distance r in the PCMS. The\n1D kernel K0 (q, r) incorporates the effects of Coulomb\ninteraction and of Bose-Einstein symmetrization.\nContamination by uncorrelated pairs (weak decay\nproducts accepted by the track selection cuts, misidentified particles, etc.) dilute the correlation and reduce\nR(q). It has been confirmed by simulation that the contamination is approximately constant in q, so that the\nreduction factor can be assumed to be q-independent.\nThe source function S(r) then gets reduced by the same\nr-independent factor due to the linearity of Eq.

Error bars indicate statistical errors only; systematic uncertainties are smaller than statistical\nones.\n\nEq. (4). Alternatively, Eq. (2) can be truncated so as\nto include all non-vanishing moments and expressed in\nterms of independent moments only. As expected from\nsymmetry considerations, moments odd in any coordinate were found to be consistent with zero within statistical uncertainty. Up to order l = 4, there are 6 inde2\n2\n4\n4\n4\npendent moments: R0 , Rx2\n, Ry2\n, Rx4\n, Ry4\nand Rx2y2\n,\n2\n2\nwhere Rx2\nis shorthand for Rxx\netc. The independent\nmoments can then be extracted as a function of q by fitting the truncated series to the experimental 3D correlation function with the moments as the parameters of the\nfit. The present analysis emphasizes the second method,\nwith the moments computed up to order l = 4 (higher\norder moments are found to be negligible). The moments\nare shown in Fig. 2, for the multipolarity orders of l =2\nand 4, and in Fig. 1a for l = 0 (1 + R0 (q) \u2261 C 0 (q)) [23].\n4\nis comparable to\nThe magnitude of the moment Rx2y2\n4\n4\nthat of Rx4 and Ry4 .\nSubstitution of C(q) and S(r), from Eq.

Since the mathematical structure\nof Eq. (6) is the same as that of Eq. (1), the same imaging\ntechnique can be used to invert the kernel Kl of the relation to extract the source moment S\u03b1l 1 ...\u03b1l (r) from the\nl\ncorresponding correlation moment R\u03b1\n(q). Finally,\n1 ...\u03b1l\nthe total 3D source function is calculated by combining\nthe source moments for each l as in Eq. (3).\nAlternatively, the source function can be extracted by\ndirectly fitting the 3D correlation function with an assumed 3D shape for the source function. Since the 3D\ncorrelation function can be represented by the Cartesian\nmoments in the harmonic decomposition, the 3D fit corresponds to fitting the six independent non-trivial moments simultaneously with a trial source function.\nFigures 1-2 show the result of direct fits to the independent correlation moments with two 3D functions: (a)\na single triaxial Gaussian, or ellipsoid, (dotted curve) and\n(b) a Hump shape (solid curve). As mentioned, the ellipsoidal fit, with four free parameters, fails to capture\nthe low q behavior in C(q) and the large r behavior in\nS(r). On the other hand, the Hump function, with six\nfree parameters, gives a good fit. The form of the Hump\nfunction is\n!#\n\"\nx2\ny2\nz2\nr2\nS(x, y, z) = \u039b exp \u2212fs 2 \u2212 fl\n2 + 4r2 + 4r2\n4rs\n4rxl\nyl\nzl\n(7)\nwhere r2 = x2 + y 2 + z 2 and the coefficients fs and\nfl of the short and long-ranged components are given\nby fs = 1/[1 + (r/r0 )2 )] and fl = 1 \u2212 fs respectively.\nHere, the argument of the exponential shifts the behavior from that of a simple spherically symmetric Gaussian\nfor r \u226a r0 to that of a triaxial Gaussian for r \u226b r0 . The\nparameter \u039b regulates the fraction of pion pairs of which\ncorrelations are described in terms of the Hump function\n(for fit parameter values see Ref. [24]).\nSource imaging involves no assumptions on the analytical shape of the 3D source function. On the other\nhand, the moment fitting explicitly invokes a particular\nform for the 3D source function. The ellipsoid fit produces a \u03c72 /ndf value of 6.8 while the Hump produces 1.2,\nwhich indicates a better fit to the observed correlation\nmoments, as is visually evident in Figs. 1(a) and 2. Close\nagreement between the experimental data, the Hump fit\nand the restored correlation moments from imaging (see\nFigs. 1-2) strongly suggests that this assumed functional\nform properly represents the emission source. However,\nthe uniqueness of the source function is, for example, not\nguaranteed beyond the region to which data are sensitive\n\n\f5\n\nC(qx)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(d) S + Sx2\n\nPb+Pb\n\u221asNN=17.3 GeV\n\n1.15\n1.1\n\n10\n\n0<cen<7 %\n\n1.05\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n(b) C\n\n2\n+ Cy2\n+ +\n\n0\n\n2\nSy2\n\n(e) S +\n\n\u03c0 \u03c0 &\u03c0\u03c0\n\n1.15\n\n- -\n\n10\n\n0<kT<70 MeV/c\n-0.35<yL-y0<0.35\n\n1.1\n\n2\n\n-7\n\nC(qy)\n\n1.2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n1.05\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n(c) C +\n\n2\nCz2\n\n0\n\n(f) S +\n\n2\nSz2\n\n1.1\n\nC(qz)\n\n2\n\n10\nData\nImaging\n\n1.05\n\n10\n\n2\n\nS(rz)\n\nThe event simulation code THERMINATOR allows for\ntests of the emission dynamics and of the breakup time of\nthe reaction systems [18, 19, 20, 26]. The code simulates\nthermal emissions from a cylinder with input transverse\nradius \u03c1max . Bjorken longitudinal boost invariance is assumed, and an expansion with transverse radial velocity\nvr (\u03c1) = (\u03c1/\u03c1max )/(\u03c1/\u03c1max + vt ), where vt = 1.41, in the\nBlast-Wave mode of the code. A fluid element ring, defined by \u03c1 and z, breaks up at proper time \u03c4 and lab\nframe time t where t2 = \u03c4 2 + z 2 . The freezeout hypersurface is specified by \u03c4 = \u03c40 + a\u03c1 where a, the space-time\ncorrelation parameter, is set to -0.5 as was found in Ref.\n[20]. The negative value of a implies \"outside-in\" burning\nof the source i.e outer particles are emitted earlier than\ninner ones, while a positive value of a would imply the\nreverse i.e source emission from inside out. An emission\nduration parameter \u2206\u03c4 is also needed to achieve a good\nfit. All known hadronic resonance decays are included.\nTHERMINATOR parameters vt , T, \u03bcB , \u03bcs , \u03bci and\na are taken from Ref.[18, 19, 20, 27] as obtained from\nspectra and particle yields. Values of \u03c1max , \u03c40 and \u2206\u03c4\nwere obtained by matching THERMINATOR's generated source function to data shown in Figs. 3(d - f). The\nvalue of the transverse radius \u03c1max is chosen so as to\nreproduce the source function profile in the y direction;\nS(ry ) is insensitive to \u03c40 and \u2206\u03c4 . The proper lifetime \u03c40\nis determined by the short-range behavior of the source\nfunction profiles in the x and z directions.

The ellipsoid fit function\n(dotted line) underestimates the source image (squares)\nand Hump fit function (solid line) for r > 15 fm in the x\nand z directions while the Hump fit function is in good\nagreement with the source image in the x, y and z directions. This consistency check emphasizes the high degree\nof integrity with which the 3D source function is being\nextracted. The source function in the z direction is characterized by a long tail which extends beyond 30 fm.\nThe source function in x also has a non-Gaussian tail,\nwhich, for this low pT cut is less prominent than that in\nz. These aspects are decidedly different from those of a\nRHIC study [25].\nThe difference between the source functions from the\nellipsoid fit and imaging procedures is also evident from\na comparison of the corresponding correlation functions\nin the x, y and z directions as shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c) respectively. Again there is consistency between the data,\nHump fit and restored correlation functions in all three\ndirections while the differences between the ellipsoid and\nHump fit sources for r >\n15 fm are manifest by dif\u223c\n\nHump Fit\nEllipsoid Fit\n\n1\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nq (MeV/c)\n\n40\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n10 15 20 25 30\n\nr (fm)\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Correlation C(qi ) (left panels) and\nsource S(ri ) (right panels) function profiles for \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 pairs in the outward x (top panels), sideward y (middle)\nand longitudinal z (bottom) directions. The use of symbols is\nanalogous to that in Fig. 1. Error bars indicate statistical errors only; systematic uncertainties are smaller than statistical\nones. Here, l = 4 moments make negligible contributions.\n\nemission duration is then determined by the tails of the\nsource profiles in the x and z directions.\nThe calculation gives a good match to the experimental source function in the x, y and z directions with a\ntransverse dimension \u03c1max = 7.5\u00b10.1 fm, proper lifetime\n\u03c40 (\u03c4 = \u03c40 at \u03c1 = 0) of 7.3 \u00b1 0.1 fm/c, a proper emission duration \u2206\u03c4 = 3.7 \u00b1 0.1 fm/c and a = \u22120.5 (solid\ncircles) [28]. The errors quoted are from the matching\nprocedure alone. With these values of \u03c1max , \u03c40 and \u2206\u03c4\nwe have reexamined the role of a = \u22120.5 i.e. outside-in\nburning. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the THERMINATOR source function, calculated using various values\nof a and other previously tuned parameters [27], with the\nextracted source function. The open symbols show that\nthe calculations with a \u2265 0 overstate the extracted source\nfunction profile in the z direction. Attempts to compensate for this overshoot via different combinations of\n\u03c1max , \u03c40 and \u2206\u03c4 were unsuccessful. Therefore, this failure suggests that a negative value for a, hence \"outsidein\" particle emission, is required to reproduce the extracted source function. The success of the THERMINATOR model simulation in precisely reproducing the\nexperimental source function indicates consistency with\napproximate boost invariance at mid-rapidity, blast-wave\n\n\f6\n10\n\n3\n\n0\n\ngests outside-in burning and provides values of the proper\ntime for breakup and the emission duration.\n\n2\n\n(a) S + Sx2\nPb+Pb \u221asNN=17.3GeV\n\n2\n\nS(rx)\n\n10\n\n- -\n\nImage\n\n0<kT<70 MeV/c\n\n10\n\nThis work was supported by the US Department\nof Energy Grant DE-FG03-97ER41020/A000 and DEFG02-03ER41259, the Bundesministerium fur Bildung\nund Forschung, Germany 06F 137, the Virtual Institute VI-146 of Helmholtz Gemeinschaft, Germany,\nthe Polish State Committee for Scientific Research (1\nP03B 006 30, 1 P03B 097 29, 1 PO3B 121 29, 1\nP03B 127 30), the Hungarian Scientific Research Foundation (T032648, T032293, T043514), the Hungarian\nNational Science Foundation, OTKA, (F034707), the\nPolish-German Foundation, the Korea Science & Engineering Foundation (R01-2005-000-10334-0), the Bulgarian National Science Fund (Ph-09/05), the Croatian\nMinistry of Science, Education and Sport (Project 0980982887-2878), the National Science Foundation NSF\nPHY-0555893 and PHY-0800026.\n\n0<cen<7 %\n\n\u03c0 \u03c0 &\u03c0\u03c0\n+ +\n\n-0.35<yL-y0<0.35\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(b) S + Sy2\nTHERMINATOR Blast-Wave\n\u03c40=7.3fm/c, \u03c1max=7.5fm\n\u2206\u03c4=3.7fm/c\n\n2\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\n(x 10 fm )\nS(ry)\n\n1\n\na = -0.5\na = 0.\na = 0.5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(c) S + Sz2\n2\n\nS(rz)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nr (fm)\nFIG. 4: (color online) Source function profiles, S(ri ), comparison in the (a) x, (b) y and (c) z directions between the imaged\ndata (squares) and THERMINATOR Blast-Wave model with\nvarious values of a (circles and triangles).

The deduced time scales are similar but the geometric transverse radius is quite different. This difference results from the inclusion of resonances in THERMINATOR, as well as different parametrizations of T\nand vr (\u03c1). Conclusions from these THERMINATOR parameters are, of course, model dependent and therefore\nnot necessarily unique.
