In these notes,\nwe will investigate the physics of GPDs in the limit where the momentum transfer on the target is purely transverse and we will show that the t-dependence\nof GPDs in this limit can be identified with the Fourier transform of parton\ndistributions in the transverse plane w.r.t. the impact parameter.\n2\n\nGeneralized parton distributions\n\nGPDs are defined very similar to regular parton distributions\n\u0012 \u2212\u0013 \u001d\n\u001c\n\u0012 \u2212\u0013\ndx\u2212 ip+ x\u2212 x\nx\nx\n\u03b3+q\nP \u2032 q\u0304 \u2212\nP\n(2)\ne\n4\u03c0\n2\n2\n1\n1\ni\u03c3 +\u03bd \u2206\u03bd\n= Hq (x, \u03be, t) + \u016b(P \u2032 )\u03b3 + u(P ) + Eq (x, \u03be, t) + \u016b(P \u2032 )\nu(P )\n2p\n2p\n2M\n\u0001\nwhere light front (LF) coordinates are defined as x\u00b1 = \u221a12 x0 \u00b1 x3 , x\u22a5 =\n(x1 , x2 ), and \u2206 = p\u2032 \u2212 p.\nFq (x, \u03be, t) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\fUnlike the familiar (forward) parton distribution functions (PDFs)\n\u0012 \u2212\u0013 \u001d\n\u001c\n\u0012 \u2212\u0013\nZ\ndx\u2212 ip+ x\u2212 x\nx\nx\n+\nq(x) =\n\u03b3 q\nP q\u0304 \u2212\nP ,\ne\n4\u03c0\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhich have the physical meaning of a momentum density in the infinite momentum frame (IMF), GPDs do not have the meaning of a density but that\nof a probability amplitude:, GPDs describe the amplitude for finding a quark\nwith momentum fraction x \u2212 \u03be (in the IMF) in the nucleon and replacing it\nback into the nucleon with a momentum transfer \u2206\u03bc .\nSeveral limiting cases are familiar: for p\u2032 = p one recovers the usual PDFs\nH(x, 0, 0) = q(x)\n\nH\u0303(x, 0, 0) = \u2206q(x),\n\nwhile integration over x yields the familiar form factors, e.g.\nZ\nZ\ndxH(x, \u03be, t) = F1 (t)\ndxE(x, \u03be, t) = F2 (t).\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore another simple physical interpretation is that GPDs 'measure'\nthe contribution of quarks with longitudinal momentum fraction x\nto the corresponding form factor, i.e. GPDs are the form factor for the\noperator that 'filters out' quarks with longitudinal momentum fraction x in\nthe proton (in conventional PDFs, the quark is inserted back into the nucleon\nwithout momentum transfer).\nGiven the latter analogy, and given the fact that one can associate the\nFourier transform of form factors with charge distributions in position space,\nit is very tempting to expect that GPDs also contain some information about\nthe distribution of partons in position space.\n3\n\nThe physical interpretation of H(x, 0, t)\n\nIn this section we will focus on the helicity non-flip case (unpolarized) a .\nFurthermore, we consider a situation when the momentum transfer between\nthe initial and final state in Eq.

Finally, upon Fourier transforming to position space, one can turn the autocorrelation function in Eq.\n(12) into a density.

Therefore, LF Fock space amplitudes transform under purely \u22a5\nboosts very similar to the way NR wave functions transform. For example, for\nthe two and three body Fock components one finds\n\n\u03c8q\u22a5 (x, k\u22a5 ) = \u03c80\u22a5 (x, k\u22a5 \u2212 xq\u22a5 )\n\u03c8q\u22a5 (x, k\u22a5 , y, l\u22a5 ) = \u03c80\u22a5 (x, k\u22a5 \u2212 xq\u22a5 , y, l\u22a5 \u2212 yq\u22a5 ).\n\n(15)\n\nBecause of the very similar boost properties and the very similar expressions\nfor GPDs one the one hand (7) and NR form factors on the other hand (8), one\ncan proceed with GPDs in analogy with NR form factors to express them in\nterms of a density.

In complete analogy with NR form factors this allows one to express H(x, t) as the\nFourier transform of parton distributions in the \u22a5 plane\nZ\nH(x, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) = d2 b\u22a5 e\u2212i\u2206\u22a5 *b\u22a5 f (x, b\u22a5 ),\n(17)\nwhere f (x, b\u22a5 ) is the probability density to find a quark with momentum fraction\nx at \u22a5 distance b\u22a5 from the \u22a5 center of momentum\nP\nx\nr\n\u2261\nRCM\n\u22a5\ni i i,\u22a5 .\n4\n\n\fNote that f (x, b\u22a5 ) is gauge invariant: to prove this, one uses that a formal\noperator definition of f (x, b\u22a5 ), which in LF gauge is given by 3\n\u0012 \u2212\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2212\n\u0013\nZ\ndx\u2212 ip+ x\u2212 x\nx\nx\n+\nf (x, b\u22a5 ) =\ne\n, b\u22a5 \u03c8loc (. 18)\n\u03c8loc q\u0304 \u2212 , b\u22a5 \u03b3 q\n4\u03c0\n2\n2\nR\nHere |\u03c8loc i \u2261 d2 p\u22a5 \u03c8(p\u22a5 ) |pi is a wave packet of plane wave proton states\nwhich is very localized in the transverse direction, but still has a sharp longitudinal momentum. This can be accomplished by taking \u03c8(p\u22a5 ) = const.,\nwhich guarantees that the \u22a5 center of momentum (the variable conjugate to\nthe total \u22a5 momentum!) is at the origin. To make Eq. (18) manifestly gauge\n\u2212\n\u2212\ninvariant one inserts a straight line gauge string from (\u2212 x2 , b\u22a5 ) to( x2 , b\u22a5 ).\nThis example also illustrates why the \u22a5 center of momentum is of significance here: first of all, the intrinsic dynamics of the hadron is independent of\nthe overall \u22a5 momentum in the IMF (\u22a5 boosts are purely kinematical), which\nallows to localize the the wave packet in the \u22a5 direction through a wave packet.\nSince the variable conjugate to the overall \u22a5 momentum is RCM\n\u22a5 , localizing\nthe wave packet is equivalent to working in the frame where RCM\n= 0. b\n\u22a5\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nBy means of a Fourier transform, H(x, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) tells us how partons are distributed in the transverse plane as a function of the distance from the \u22a5 center of momentum. First of all this provides us, at least for \u03be = 0, with a very\nsimple interpretation for GPDs in terms of a density. A similar interpretation exists for H\u0303(x, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ). in terms of polarized impact parameter dependent\nquark distributions in a longitudinally polarized target. These fundamental\nresults by themselves are already important observations because they illustrate the kind of physics that one can learn about hadrons by studying GPDs.\nHowever, above and beyond this physics insight, our results also have a number\nof practical application because they allow one to use geometric insights about\nhadron structure to model GPDs as illustrated by the following examples:\n1. First of all, the mere fact that the b\u22a5 distribution is measured w.r.t.\nRCM\nnecessarily implies that the width of the b\u22a5 distribution goes to\n\u22a5\nzero as x \u2192 1, since the active quark becomes the \u22a5 center of mass in\nthat limit. In momentum space this implies that H(x, t) should become\nt-independent as x \u2192 1. Many models for GPDs are consistent with this\nkind of behavior, but our analysis indicates that this is a general result.\nb Of\n\ncourse the same reasoning also applies to the familiar case of the NR form factor.\n\n5\n\n\f2. Eq. (18) illustrates that the impact parameter dependent parton distributions can be expressed in the form\n2\n\nf (x, b\u22a5 ) \u223c \u03c8loc b\u2020 (xp+ , b\u22a5 )b(xp+ , b\u22a5 ) \u03c8loc = b(xp+ , b\u22a5 )|\u03c8loc\n\n,\n(19)\nwhere b(xp+ , b\u22a5 ) creates quarks of long. momentum xp+ at \u22a5 position\nb\u22a5 . This implies that f (x, b\u22a5 ) has a probabilistic interpretation, and\ntherefore it has to satisfy positivity constraints, i.e.\nZ\nfq (x, b\u22a5 ) \u2261 d2 \u2206\u22a5 Hq (x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 )ei\u2206\u22a5 *b\u22a5\n(20)\nshould be positive for all x and all b\u22a5 (for antiquarks the same holds\nmodulo an obvious sign). This positivity condition provides us with a\nnew constraint on all models for GPDs.\n3. Since very little is known about the actual t-dependence of GPDs, it is\noften convenient to use simple parameterizations. A commonly used form\n2 1\u2212x\n(motivated by LF constituent models) is H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) = q(x)e\u2212a\u2206\u22a5 x .\nHowever, such a \u2206\u22a5 -dependence yields an unacceptably rapid growth\nfor the \u22a5 hadron size hb2\u22a5 i \u223c x1 in the small x region. Space time\ndescriptions of parton structure in the small x region6 suggest a \u22a5 size of\nhadrons that grows like \u03b1 ln x1 . Translated into GPDs this implies that\nthe small x behavior should be parameterized by a functional form like\n2\n\n1\n\nH(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) = q(x)e\u2212\u03b1\u2206\u22a5 ln x\n\n2\n\n1\n\nor q(x)e\u2212\u03b1\u2206\u22a5 (1\u2212x) ln x\n\n(21)\n\n(the 2nd ansatz is also consistent with the Drell-Yan-West relation).\n4. At a more qualitative level, one expects quarks at large x to come from\nthe more localized valence 'core' of the hadron, while the small x region\nshould also receive contributions from the much wider meson 'cloud'\nand therefore one would in general expect a gradual increase of the tdependence of H(x, 0, t) as one goes from larger to smaller values of x\n5\n\nThe Physics of E(x, 0, t)\n\nSo far we have only considered GPDs in an unpolarized (or longitudinally)\npolarized nucleon. For polarized nucleon states (we use an IMF helicity basis\nhere 7 ) one finds the following useful relations when \u2206+ = 0\nZ\n\u0001\ndx\u2212 ip+ x\u2212 x\n(22)\ne\nP + \u2206, \u2191 q\u0304 (0) \u03b3 + q x\u2212 P, \u2191 = H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 )\n4\u03c0\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2206x \u2212 i\u2206y\ndx\u2212 ip+ x\u2212 x\ne\nP + \u2206, \u2191 q\u0304 (0) \u03b3 + q x\u2212 P, \u2193 = \u2212\nE(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ),\n4\u03c0\n2M\n6\n\n\fi.e. if we take for example a nucleon polarized in the x direction (in the IMF)\nFq (x, 0, \u2212\u2206\u22a5 ) = H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) + i\n\n\u2206y\nE(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ).\nM\n\n(23)\n\nEq. (23) allows us to draw the following conclusions for the physics of E(x, 0, t)\n1. We know already that H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) describes the distribution of unpolarized partons in the \u22a5 plane for a nucleon that is either unpolarized or\npolarized in the z direction. From Eq. (23) we can immediately read off\nthat \u2206M\u22a5 E(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) describes how the distribution of partons\nin the \u22a5 plane depends on the polarization of the nucleon. For\nexample, for a nucleon polarized in the x direction the z-momentum distribution of partons on the +y side will differ from the one on the \u2212y side\n- which makes sense if one considers the classical picture of a sphere\nthat spins around the x-direction while moving in the z-direction. The\nz-momenta due to spinning add to the translatory momenta for 'partons'\non the +y side and subtract on the \u2212y side and hence it is not surprising\nto find a difference between the parton distributions on the \u00b1y sides.\n2. Since the probabilistic interpretation should not depend on the polarization, above interpretation provides us with another positivity constraint\nrelating the Fourier transform of E to the one of H:\n\u2207b\u22a5\nM\n\nZ\n\nd2 b\u22a5 eib\u22a5 *\u2206\u22a5 E(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) <\n\nZ\n\nd2 b\u22a5 eib\u22a5 *\u2206\u22a5 H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ). (24)\n\n3. Finally, we are also ableR to illustrate the physics of Ji's angular momentum sum rule hJq i = 21 dxx [Hq (x, 0, 0) + Eq (x, 0, 0)]. For this purpose,\nwe first note that GPDs for \u03be = 0 allow the simultaneous determination of the momentum of partons in the z direction and their position in\nthe \u22a5 direction (which is very much reminiscent of angular momentum\nLx = xpz \u2212 zpx ) and it should thus not surprise that GPDs allow determining the total angular momentum of the quarks. In order to illustrate\nthis connection, let us consider a nucleon polarized in the x direction.c\nBecause we are interested in the angular momentum in the rest frame\nof the target, we again need to consider again nucleons polarized in the\nc I was only able to find a simple physical interpretation for the connection between GPDs\nand the \u22a5 components of J~q . However, by rotational invariance, one can apply the result\nalso to Jqz , and, by boost invariance, Jqz should also be he same for a nucleon moving in the\nz-direction.\n\n7\n\n\fx-direction, but now in the nucleon rest frame. This differs from the IMF\nby a Melosh rotation and one finds up to terms linear in \u2206\u22a5\nFq (x, 0, \u2206\u22a5 ) = H(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) + i\n\n\u0003\n\u2206y \u0002\nH(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) + E(x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) .

What is\nnew is that through the geometric interpretation of GPDs, we are now\nable to understand the physics of this sum rule by relating GPDs to the\nexpectation value of hypz i for a nucleon polarized in the x direction.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by a grant from DOE (FG03-95ER40965) and through\nJefferson Lab by contract DE-AC05-84ER40150 under which the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) operates the Thomas Jefferson\nNational Accelerator Facility.\n1.
