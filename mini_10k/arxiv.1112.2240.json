The continued non-detection in its 22 (IC22, [1]), 40 (IC40, [2]) and 59 (IC59 [3])\nstring configuration puts more and more stringent limits on GRB neutrino flux. The IC40 limit is comparable to\nthe theoretical prediction [2], whereas the combined IC40 and IC59 limit is only 0.22 times the prediction [3]. These\nlimits start to put interesting constraints on the GRB neutrino models of Waxman and Bahcall [4, 5] and Guetta\net al. (2004) [6], and challenges GRBs as the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). However, in this\nnote we show that the approach that IceCube [1\u20133] takes in theoretical prediction is somewhat different from that of\nWaxman and Bahcall and Guetta et al. [4\u20136], leading to overestimate of GRB neutrino flux by a factor of \u223c 5 for\ntypical GRB parameters. This is because of ignoring the effects of the energy dependence of charged pion production\nand secondary pion/muon cooling on the normalization of neutrino flux.\nThe approach taken by IceCube papers [1\u20133] is presented in the appendix of the IC22 paper [1]. In their approach,\nthe muon neutrino flux from a GRB, F\u03bd , (with neutrino oscillation the electron, muon and tau neutrinos roughly\nshare equal energy [7]) is scaled to the proton flux in the GRB, Fp , as\n1\nf\u03c0,b\n(1)\n8\n(this comes from eq [A8] of [1]). Here f\u03c0,b \u2261 f\u03c0 (E = Eb ) is the fraction of energy of protons with Eb carried by\ncharged pions, and Eb is the energy of protons that interact with photons with spectral-break energy \u01ebb at \u2206 resonance\n[4],\nF\u03bdIC /Fp =\n\nEb = 1.3 \u00d7 1016 \u039322.5 \u01eb\u22121\nb,MeV eV,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393 = 102.5 \u03932.5 is the bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB, and \u01ebb = 1\u01ebb,MeV MeV. The f\u03c0,b value depends on the\nGRB properties, and varies from burst to burst (see eqs [A7] and [A8] of [1]). The factor 1/8 is due to the facts\nthat one half of the p\u03b3 interactions produce charged pions, and that each generated neutrino is assumed to carry one\nfourth of the secondary pion energy. The proton flux can be normalized to gamma-ray flux by Fp = (1/fe )F\u03b3 where\nfe is the ratio of accelerated proton to electron energy. In what follows we show that the approximation in eq (1) is\ndifferent from the models of Waxman and Bahcall [4, 5] and Guetta et al [6], and leads to overestimate of the neutrino\nflux.\nFor a flat proton distribution with index p \u2248 2 (E 2 dnp /dE \u221d E 2\u2212p ), and a typical GRB spectrum with Bandfunction parameters, \u03b1\u03b3 = 1 and \u03b2\u03b3 = 2, f\u03c0 (E) = f\u03c0,b is valid for protons with E > Eb . However, for E < Eb ,\nf\u03c0 \u221d E reduces with E decreasing because fewer target photons at high energy [4]. Thus by using f\u03c0 (E) = f\u03c0,b in\nenergies E < Eb eq. (1) overestimates the neutrino flux.\nMoreover, eq. (1) also ignores the suppression of neutrino production at high energies due to the radiative cooling\nof secondary pions/muons[15]. The synchrotron cooling timescale is shorter than the secondary decay time at energies\nabove the cooling energy [1, 5, 6],\n\u001a\n1 (\u03bc\u00b1 )\n\u22121/2\n17\n1/2 4\nEc,\u03c0/\u03bc = 2 \u00d7 10 (\u01ebe /\u01ebB ) \u03932.5 \u2206t\u22122 L52 \u00d7\neV.\n(3)\n10 (\u03c0 \u00b1 )\nHere L = 1052 L52 erg s\u22121 is the GRB (isotropic) luminosity, \u2206t = 10\u22122 \u2206t\u22122 s is the GRB variability time, and \u01ebe and\n\u01ebB are the fractions of internal energy carried by postshock electrons and magnetic field, respectively.\n\n\f2\nThus the neutrino production is mainly contributed by protons with Eb < E < Ec , which is only a fraction of the\ntotal accelerated protons in energy. The distribution of the accelerated protons is expected to be a power law between\nthe minimum and maximum energy. For mildly-relativistic GRB internal shocks, the minimum accelerated proton\nenergy might be\nEmin \u2243 \u0393mp c2 = 3 \u00d7 1011 \u0393300 eV.\n\n(4)\n\nThe maximum proton energy is determined by the limit of synchrotron cooling for typical GRB parameters [8],\n5/2\n\n1/2\n\n\u22121/4 \u22121/2\n\nEmax = 2.5 \u00d7 1020 \u0393300 \u2206t\u22122 \u01eb1/4\ne \u01ebB\n\ng\n\n\u22121/4\n\nL52\n\neV,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere g & 1 accounts for the uncertainty in particle acceleration time.\nSince the neutrino production is mainly contributed by protons with Eb < E < Ec where f\u03c0 (E) = f\u03c0,b , the muon\nneutrino flux F\u03bd is estimated to be\nZ Ec\nZ\n1\ndnp\nF\u03bdIC Ec dnp\nln(Ec /Eb )\nF\u03bd \u2248\nf\u03c0,b E\ndE =\ndE \u2248 F\u03bdIC\n,\n(6)\nE\n8\ndE\nF\ndE\nln(E\np\nmax /Emin )\nEb\nEb\nR Emax dnp\nwhere Fp = Emin\nE dE dE and Eq (1) have been used, and the last equation holds for p \u2248 2.

Typically for GRBs with \u03b1\u03b3 = 1, \u03b2\u03b3 = 2, and \u01ebobs\n= \u01ebb /(1 + z) = 0.2 MeV, the correction factor is F\u03bd /F\u03bdIC = 0.2,\nb\ni.e., the neutrino flux is overestimated by a factor of 5 in [1\u20133].\nNote the neutrino spectrum used here (eqs. 7 and 8) is different from the one by IceCube papers [1\u20133] at high\n\u2212(\u03b2\u03bd +2)\nat \u03b5 > \u03b5c,\u03bc (see eq. [A3] in IC22 paper [1]), which\nenergy; they assume a simple steepening dnob\n\u03bd\u03bc /d\u03b5 \u221d \u03b5\nunderestimate the neutrino emission from pion decay. Using their spectral shape, the neutrino flux is even smaller\nthan using ours, thus the correction factor is even smaller.\nTABLE I: The value of F\u03bd /F\u03bdIC for various spectral parameter values.\n\u03b1\u03b3\n1 0.5 1.5 1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b2\u03b3\n2\n2\n2 1.5 3\n2\n2\n\u01ebobs\n2\nb /MeV 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.05\nF\u03bd /F\u03bdIC 0.20 0.12 0.56 0.25 0.18 0.14 0.30\nNote\u2013The other parameters are \u0393 = 300, \u2206t = 10\u22122 s, L = 1052 erg s\u22121 , z = 1.5 and Emax = 1021 eV. The redshift z only has\neffect on the GRB spectral break, \u01ebb = \u01ebobs\nb (1 + z).\n\nIn summary, for a flat energy distribution of accelerated protons in GRBs, p \u2248 2, the predicted neutrino flux using\neq (1), so as the approach taken by [1\u20133], is overestimated by a factor of F\u03bdIC /F\u03bd , typically \u223c 5, compared to the\nmodels by [4\u20136]. So the IC40 limit of neutrino flux [2] actually should be above the prediction after correction, while\nthe combined IC40 and IC59 limit, which is claimed to be 0.22 times of the prediction [3], could be consistent with\nthe correct prediction.\nSome comments should be made here. In this brief note we point out that when trying to test the models of\n[4\u20136] with data, the IceCube papers [1\u20133] actually take an approach different from the former models in calculating\nthe neutrino flux, leading to overestimate. However, the models of [4\u20136] consider only \u2206 resonance and neglect the\nmulti-pion production [9, 10], the kaon production [11] and the possible secondary particle acceleration [12]. All these\nfacts may increase the neutrino flux and somewhat compensate the overestimate. It is also worth mentioning that if\nUHECRs are produced by the decay of neutrons that escape from the GRB outflow, it is straightforward to relate\nthe neutrino flux with the observed UHECR flux, and avoid the uncertainties in parameters, e.g., f\u03c0 and fe [13]. If\nthe assumption that only neutrons escape is true, the neutrino flux will also increase.\nFinally it should be stressed that there are large uncertainties in the GRB neutrino models, which may cause lower\nf\u03c0 and hence lower neutrino flux, e.g., larger emission size or larger bulk Lorentz factor. More observations by IceCube\nare required to push the sensitivity below the uncertainties [14], and test the assumption of GRBs as the UHECR\nsources.\nThe author thanks the anonymous referees for valuable comments.
