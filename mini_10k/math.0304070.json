We present a combinatorial game, the \"root game\", which provides\nsome criteria for determining which of the Schubert intersection numbers vanish.

The image of a Schubert class under this map is a positive sum of Schubert\nclasses on G\u2032 /B \u2032 . We investigate the problem of determining which Schubert classes\nappear with non-zero coefficient. This is the vanishing problem for branching Schubert calculus, which plays an important role in representation theory and symplectic\ngeometry, as shown in [Berenstein-Sjamaar 2000]. The root game generalises to give a\nvanishing criterion and a non-vanishing criterion for this problem.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we introduce some techniques for studying vanishing problems in Schubert\ncalculus. The most basic and famous such problem concerns the cohomology ring of a\ngeneralised flag manifold G/B: we would like to determine combinatorially which of the\nstructure constants for H \u2217 (G/B) are non-zero. We refer to this as the vanishing problem for multiplication in Schubert calculus. However, the techniques we introduce here\napply in a more general context, namely to the vanishing problem for branching Schubert\ncalculus-discussed below-of which the multiplication problem is a special case. Although\nit is possible to calculate any structure constants for these problems explicitly (e.g. using\nSchubert polynomials [BH]), the known methods involve alternating sums, and thus provide\nlittle insight into the question of which terms vanish. A complete combinatorial solution to\neither of these problems is still not known.\nOur first objective is to provide some vanishing and non-vanishing criteria for intersection numbers of Schubert varieties on G/B. Geometrically, the problem is this: given\n\u2217\n\nResearch partially supported by an NSERC scholarship.\n\n1\n\n\fs \u2265 3 Schubert varieties in general position, determine whether or not their intersection is\nempty. If we know the Schubert intersection numbers we also implicitly have the Schubert\nstructure constants for H \u2217 (G/B) (from the Poincar\u00e9 pairing), thus this also addresses the\nvanishing problem for multiplication.\nIn Section 3, we introduce the root game which can often give information about a\nSchubert intersection number. In some circumstances the root game will tell us that the\nintersection number is 0 (Theorem 1); in other circumstances, the game will tell us that\nthe intersection number is at least 1 (Theorem 2). Unfortunately, in a few cases, the root\ngame gives no information; remarkably though, for G = SL(n), n \u2264 7 we have confirmed\nby computer that all of these remaining cases have intersection number 0.\nThe rules of the root game are manifestly symmetric under permutations of the classes\nintersected, as well as under automorphisms of G. Furthermore, once the game has been\nfully internalized, it is highly amenable to computations by hand.\nOur second objective is to show that the main results hold in an even more general\nsetting, which we call branching Schubert calculus. Let i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G be an inclusion of complex\nreductive connected Lie groups. Choose Borel subgroups B \u2032 \u2282 G and B \u2282 G such that\ni(B \u2032 ) \u2282 B. Then we obtain an inclusion i : G\u2032 /B \u2032 \u0592\u2192 G/B (which we also denote by i, in a\nmild abuse of notation). Hence there is a map on cohomology i\u2217 : H \u2217 (G/B) \u2192 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ).\nThe problem of branching Schubert calculus is to determine the map i\u2217 in the Schubert\nbasis, i.e. given a Schubert class \u03c9 \u2208 H \u2217 (G/B) we would like to express i\u2217 (\u03c9) \u2208 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 )\nin the Schubert basis of the latter.\nThe coefficients which appear in such an expression are always non-negative integers.\nAlthough there are formulae for these integers, it is not known how to determine them\ncombinatorially, or even how to determine which terms appear. In Section 4, we investigate\nthe latter problem, and obtain some widely applicable criteria for determining which terms\nappear.\nThe vanishing problem for branching Schubert calculus generalises the vanishing problem for multiplication in Schubert calculus: if i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G = G\u2032 \u00d7G\u2032 is the diagonal inclusion,\nthen the map i\u2217 is just the cup product in cohomology. Similarly, multiplication of more\nthan two terms comes from considering the diagonal inclusion G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G\u2032 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 G\u2032 .\nOur motivation for this work comes from [BS], in which Berenstein and Sjamaar use\nthe vanishing problem for branching Schubert calculus to answer questions in symplectic\ngeometry and representation theory. Let K \u2032 and K be the maximal compact subgroups of\nG\u2032 and G respectively. Berenstein and Sjamaar use the vanishing problem for branching\nSchubert calculus to calculate the K \u2032 moment polytope of a K-coadjoint orbit. They show\nthat each non-vanishing branching coefficient gives rise to an inequality satisfied by the\nmoment polytope. Moreover, all together, the complete list of non-vanishing branching\ncoefficients gives a sufficient set of inequalities for this polytope.\nThis symplectic problem is to be equivalent to an asymptotic version of a fundamental representation theory question, as shown in [H, GS] (for more of this picture see also\n[GLS]). Let \u03bb and \u03bc be dominant weights for G and G\u2032 respectively. Let V\u03bb denote the\nirreducible G-representation with highest weight \u03bb; similarly let V\u03bc\u2032 denote the irreducible\nG\u2032 -representation with highest weight \u03bc. When V\u03bb is decomposed as a G\u2032 -module, it is a\nbasic question whether a component of type V\u03bc\u2032 appears. The asymptotic version of this\nproblem is the following: does there exists a positive integer N , such that the G-module\n2\n\n\fVN \u03bb has a component of type VN\u2032 \u03bc , when decomposed as a G\u2032 -module? The answer is\nyes if and only if the point \u03bc lies in the K \u2032 -moment polytope for the K-coadjoint orbit\nthrough \u03bb. Thus the non-vanishing branching coefficients give an answer to this asymptotic\nrepresentation theory question as well.\nIn studying the vanishing problem for branching Schubert calculus, we will actually be\nconsidering the following apparently simpler problem: determine which Schubert classes are\nin the kernel of i\u2217 . While this may at first seem to be a vast simplification, it is in fact\nequivalent to the original problem, as shown by Proposition 2.2. In the case of vanishing for\nmultiplication of Schubert classes, this is a familiar fact: we can determine which structure\nconstants of the cohomology ring are zero, based on the which triple products vanish.\nThe paper begins with a discussion of the geometry underlying the root games (section\n2). The basic idea is to use Kleiman's Bertini theorem [Kl] to reduce the vanishing problem\nto a transversality problem in the tangent space to a point in G/B. Given an intersection\nin the tangent space, we attempt to show it is transverse by degenerating it to a position\nwhere transversality is easily verifiable. If this is possible, we can conclude that that a\ncorresponding Schubert class is not in the kernel of i\u2217 .\nThe degenerations in question can be encoded combinatorially; doing so gives the root\ngame. In Section 3, we introduce the root game for Schubert intersection numbers. Section\n4 contains the more general root game for branching Schubert calculus, and proofs of the\nmain theorems. Ultimately it is the proof of Theorems 4 and 5, which tie the combinatorics\ninto the geometry.\nWe refer the reader to [F] for a general reference on type A Schubert calculus, and to\n[BH] for the other classical Lie groups.\nThe author is deeply grateful to Allen Knutson, for providing a lot of helpful feedback\non this paper.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nGeometry of vanishing problem for branching Schubert\ncalculus\nConventions\n\nGiven i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G, an inclusion of complex reductive connected Lie groups, we wish to study\nthe map i\u2217 : H \u2217 (G/B) \u2192 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ). First, we need to demonstrate that the derived map\ni : G\u2032 /B \u2032 \u0592\u2192 G/B always exists.\nProposition 2.1. Given i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G there exist Borel subgroups B \u2032 \u2282 G\u2032 and B \u2282 G such\nthat i(B \u2032 ) \u2282 B.\nProof. Choose a Borel subgroup B0 \u2282 G, and consider the G\u2032 -orbits on G/B0 of minimal\ndimension. Each such orbit is closed, therefore, compact, and so is G\u2032 /P for some parabolic\nsubgroup P \u2282 G\u2032 . Choose a point x0 on such an orbit. The stabiliser of x0 inside G\u2032 , G\u2032x0 ,\nis conjugate to P , whereas the stabiliser of x0 inside G, Gx0 , is conjugate to B0 . Thus\nG\u2032x0 \u2282 Gx0 is solvable, but G\u2032 /G\u2032x0 is compact, hence G\u2032x0 is a Borel subgroup of G\u2032 . We\ntake B = Gx0 and B \u2032 = G\u2032x0 .\n\n3\n\n\fLet T \u2032 \u2282 B \u2032 be a maximal torus of G\u2032 . Extend its image i(T \u2032 ) to a maximal torus T \u2282 B\nof G. Let N \u2032 and N denote the corresponding unipotent subgroups of B \u2032 and B. Of course,\ni(N \u2032 ) \u2282 N . Henceforth we will simply view T \u2032 , N \u2032 , B \u2032 as subgroups of T , N , B respectively.\nLet \u2206 denote the root system of G, and \u2206\u2032 the root system of G\u2032 . The positive and\nnegative roots of \u2206 (with respect to the choice of B) are denoted \u2206+ and \u2206\u2212 respectively.\nFor each root \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, we fix a basis vector e\u03b1 for the corresponding root space in g. Likewise,\nfor each root \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206\u2032 , we fix a basis vector e\u2032\u03b2 for the corresponding root space in g\u2032 .\nThe tangent spaces to x0 in G/B and G\u2032 /B \u2032 are naturally are g/b and g\u2032 /b\u2032 respectively.\nThus linearising i gives a a natural inclusion of tangent spaces g\u2032 /b\u2032 \u0592\u2192 g/b. We use the\nKilling form to identify n with (g/b)\u2217 . Similarly, we identify the dual of g\u2032 /b\u2032 with n\u2032 . Thus\nwe obtain a linear map\n\u03c6 : n \u2192 n\u2032\nwhich is adjoint to the inclusion of tangent spaces g\u2032 /b\u2032 \u0592\u2192 g/b. Essentially \u03c6 encodes all\nthe information about the inclusion G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G.\nNote that since x0 is a T \u2032 -fixed point, the map \u03c6 is T \u2032 -equivariant. Thus, it takes the\nT -weight spaces to T \u2032 -weight spaces, and induces a map\n\u03c6\u0302 : \u2206+ \u2192 \u2206\u2032+ \u222a {0}\ndefined by the rule\n(\n0,\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03b1) =\n\u03b2,\n\nif \u03c6(e\u03b1 ) = 0\nwhere 0 6= \u03c6(e\u03b1 ) is in the \u03b2-weight space.\n\nIn Section 4 we will need to consider subsets T \u2282 \u2206+ with the following properties.\nDefinition 2.1. Suppose T \u2282 \u2206+ satisfies\n1. 0 \u2208\n/ \u03c6(T ), and\n2. \u03c6\u0302|T is injective.\nWe call such a subset T injective. Equivalently T \u2282 \u2206+ is injective if \u03c6|he\u03b1 | \u03b1\u2208T i is an\ninjective linear map.\n\n2.2\n\nSchubert varieties\n\nLet W = N (T )/T be the Weyl group of G. For \u03c0 \u2208 W , let [\u03c0] denote the corresponding\nT -fixed point on G/B, and let \u03c0\u0303 denote some lifting of \u03c0 \u2208 W to an element of N (T ) \u2282 G.\nLet w0 denote the long element in W . For \u03c0 \u2208 W , let \u03c0 \u2032 = w0 \u03c0. To each \u03c0 \u2208 W\nwe associate the Schubert cell X\u03c0\u25e6 = B * [\u03c0 \u2032 ], the B-orbit through [\u03c0] in G/B. Its closure\nX\u03c0 = B * [\u03c0 \u2032 ], is the Schubert variety. (This definition is slightly non-standard: it is more\ncommon to define X\u03c0 = B\u2212 * [\u03c0], where B\u2212 is an opposite Borel. Our X\u03c0 is a translation\nof the more standard one by w\u03030 .) According to these conventions X1 = G/B (where 1 \u2208 W\nrepresents the identity element) and Xw0 = {x0 }. In general X\u03c0 is a complex subvariety of\nG/B whose codimension 1 is length of \u03c0 \u2208 W (denoted l(\u03c0)).\n1\n\nAll dimensions/codimensions are over C, unless otherwise specified.\n\n4\n\n\fLet \u03c9\u03c0 denote the cohomology class Poincar\u00e9 dual to the homology class of the Schubert\nvariety X\u03c0 , that is the class such that\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9\u03c0 * \u03c3\n\u03c3=\nX\u03c0\n\nG/B\n\nfor all \u03c3 \u2208 H \u2217 (G/B). Since the the codimension of X\u03c0 is l(\u03c0), \u03c9\u03c0 is a cohomology class of\ndegree 2l(\u03c0). The class \u03c91 \u2208 H \u2217 (G/B) is the (multiplicative) identity element.\nThe following proposition shows that the vanishing problem for branching Schubert\ncalculus is equivalent to the problem of determining whether \u03c9\u03c0 \u2208 ker i\u2217 .\nProposition 2.2. Given j : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G\u2032\u2032 an inclusion of complex reductive connected groups,\nlet G = G\u2032 \u00d7 G\u2032\u2032 and i = (id \u00d7 j) \u25e6 \u03b4 : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G, where \u03b4 : G\u2032 \u2192 G\u2032 \u00d7 G\u2032 is the diagonal\nmap. Let i\u2217 : H \u2217 (G/B) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ) \u00d7 H \u2217 (G\u2032\u2032 /B \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ) be the induced map on\ncohomology. A Schubert class \u03c3 \u2208 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ) appears in the expansion of j \u2217 (\u03c9) if and only\nif (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9) \u2208\n/ ker i\u2217 , and deg \u03c3 \u2228 + deg \u03c9 = dimR G\u2032 /B \u2032 . Here \u03c3 \u2228 is the Schubert class dual to\n\u03c3 under the Poincar\u00e9 pairing .\nProof. Consider the integral\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3 \u2228 * j \u2217 (\u03c9).\nG\u2032 /B \u2032\n\nIf this\nis non-zero, then \u03c3 appears in the expansion of j \u2217 (\u03c9) (with coefficient equal\nR integral\n\u2228\n\u2217\nto G\u2032 /B \u2032 \u03c3 * j (\u03c9)); otherwise it does not.\nSince i = (id \u00d7 j) \u25e6 \u03b4, we have i\u2217 (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9) = \u03b4\u2217 (\u03c3 \u2228 , j \u2217 (\u03c9)) = \u03c3 \u2228 * j \u2217 (\u03c9), thus\nZ\nZ\n\u2228\n\u2217\ni\u2217 (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9).\n\u03c3 * j (\u03c9) =\nG\u2032 /B \u2032\n\nG\u2032 /B \u2032\n\nThe second integral is clearly non-zero if and only if (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9) \u2208\n/ ker i\u2217 and deg \u03c3 \u2228 + deg \u03c9 =\ndimR G\u2032 /B \u2032 .\nThus, to solve the vanishing problem for branching Schubert calculus for j : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G\u2032\u2032 ,\nit is sufficient to know whether i\u2217 (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9) = 0, for any given (\u03c3 \u2228 , \u03c9) \u2208 H \u2217 (G/B).\nHenceforth we shall be investigating the question of whether i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0, for \u03c0 \u2208 W . We\nwill assume that \u03c0 \u2208 W is an element whose length l(\u03c0) \u2264 dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 : if l(\u03c0) > dim G\u2032 /B \u2032\nthen i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0 for dimensional reasons. We are primarily interested in the case where\nl(\u03c0) = dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 , however except where specified otherwise, everything in this paper holds\nfor all \u03c0 \u2208 W .\n\n2.3\n\nThe multiplication problem\n\nA special and particularly important case is the vanishing problem for multiplication of\nSchubert calculus. As mentioned, in the introduction, this corresponds to the diagonal\ninclusion G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G = G\u2032 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 G\u2032 (s-factors).\nIn this case, a Schubert class \u03c9\u03c0 \u2208 H \u2217 (G/B) can be regarded as an s-tuple of Schubert\nclasses (\u03c9\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c9\u03c0s ) \u2208 (H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ))s . The map i\u2217 : H \u2217 (G/B) \u2192 H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ) gives the\nproduct of these Schubert classes in H \u2217 (G\u2032 /B \u2032 ):\ni\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c9\u03c0s ) = \u03c9\u03c01 * * * \u03c9\u03c0s .\n5\n\n\fThus the problem of determining when i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0 becomes the question of which collections\nof Schubert classes on G\u2032 /B \u2032 have non-vanishing product.\nP\nWe are most interested in the case where l(\u03c0) = l(\u03c0i ) = dim(G\u2032 /B \u2032 ). In this case we\nare investigating the Schubert intersection numbers c\u03c01 ...\u03c0s defined by\nZ\n\u03c9\u03c01 * * * \u03c9\u03c0s .\nc\u03c01 ...\u03c0s =\nG\u2032 /B \u2032\n\nThe triple Schubert intersection numbers c\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 are particularly important, as they are the\nSchubert structure constants of the cohomology ring H \u2217 (G/B). Indeed, if we write\nX\n\u03c9\u03c01 * \u03c9\u03c02 =\nc\u03c1\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c9\u03c1\n\u03c1\u2208W\n\nthen\nc\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 =\n=\n=\n\n2.4\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\u03c01 * \u03c9\u03c02 * \u03c9\u03c03\nG/B\n\nX\n\nG/B \u03c1\u2208W\n0 \u03c03\ncw\n\u03c01 \u03c02 .\n\nc\u03c1\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c9\u03c1 * \u03c9\u03c03\n\nTangent space methods\n\nThe main idea behind the results in this paper is to use Kleiman's theorem [Kl] to translated\nproblems of intersection theory on G/B into transversality questions on the tangent space\nto G/B. Tangent space methods have been used elsewhere in the literature, perhaps most\nnotably in Belkale's geometric proof of the Horn conjecture [B]. Our main lemma (Lemma\n2.4) generalises some of these ideas.\nLemma 2.3. Let x \u2208 G/B. The following conditions are equivalent:\n1. i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0,\n2. There exist g1 , g2 \u2208 G such that x \u2208 g1 X\u03c0\u25e6 \u2229 g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 , and the tangent spaces Tx g1 X\u03c0\nand Tx g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are transverse linear subspaces of Tx G/B.\nProof. We apply Kleiman's Theorem to the G-homogeneous space G/B and its subvarieties\nX\u03c0 and G\u2032 /B \u2032 . Consider the intersections\nIg1 ,g2 = g1 X\u03c0 \u2229 g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032\nand\nIg\u25e61 ,g2 = g1 X\u03c0\u25e6 \u2229 g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 .\nIf g1 , g2 are generic elements of G, Kleiman's theorem tells us that a generic point x\u0303 of\nIg1 ,g2 is a smooth point of g1 X\u03c0 which can be assumed to lie in g1 X\u03c0\u25e6 ; moreover the varieties g1 X\u03c0\u25e6 and g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are transverse at x\u0303. In particular Ig1 ,g2 is generically reduced\nand equidimensional. If Ig1 ,g2 is zero-dimensional then Ig1 ,g2 is finite, with cardinality\n6\n\n\fR\n#(Ig1 ,g2 ) = G\u2032 /B \u2032 i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ). More generally Ig1 ,g2 defines a homology class in G\u2032 /B \u2032 which is\nPoincar\u00e9 dual to to the cohomology class i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ). In particular, we have that i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0 if\nand only if Ig1 ,g2 (or equivalently Ig\u25e61 ,g2 ) is nonempty for generic (g1 , g2 ) \u2208 G \u00d7 G.\nLet A = {(g1 , g2 ) | Ig\u25e61 ,g2 6= \u2205}. (Note G\u2032 \u00d7 G\u2032 \u2282 A so A is always non-empty.) We have\njust shown \u0100 = G \u00d7 G if and only if i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0. Let (g1 , g2 ) be a generic point of A (If A, is\nreducible choose any component), and x\u0303 \u2208 Ig1 ,g2 be a generic point of Ig1 ,g2 . If i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0\nthen (g1 , g2 ) is in fact a generic point of G \u00d7 G and so the varieties g1 X\u03c0 and g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are\ntransverse at x\u0303. However, note that the set\n{(g1 , g2 ) | g1 X\u03c0\u25e6 and g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 have a transverse point of intersection}\nis necessarily open (intuitively this is because a transverse intersection remains transverse\nunder perturbation). Thus, conversely, if g1 X\u03c0 and g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are transverse at x\u0303, then\n\u0100 = G \u00d7 G and hence i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0.\nFinally, since G acts transitively on G/B, we can find g \u2208 G such that gx\u0303 = x. Then\ng1 X\u03c0 and g2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are transverse at x\u0303 iff gg1 X\u03c0 and gg2 G\u2032 /B \u2032 are transverse at x. This\ncompletes the proof.\nLemma 2.3 is still not concrete enough for our purposes. We reformulate it as follows.\nFor a \u2208 N , let a* : n \u2192 n denote the adjoint action of N on its Lie algebra. Let Q \u2282 n\nbe the subspace generated by the e\u03b1 such that \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ and \u03c0 \u22121 * \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 . Equivalently,\nQ = n \u2229 (\u03c0 * b\u2212 ).\nLemma 2.4. The following are equivalent:\n1. i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0.\n2. \u03c6|a*Q is injective for some a \u2208 N .\n3. \u03c6|a*Q is injective for generic a \u2208 N .\nThe tangent space to G/B at x0 is naturally g/b. We identify the cotangent space\n(g/b)\u2217 with n using the Killing form. Under these identifications, Q\u22a5 \u2243 ((\u03c0 \u2032 * b) + b)/b.\nThe subspace a * Q \u2282 n is identified with the conormal space at the point x0 to a translated\nSchubert variety g * X\u03c0 \u220b x0 . Thus Lemma 2.4 is essentially a dual statement to Lemma\n2.3.\nProof. The equivalence of conditions 2 and 3 is clear, as the maps \u03c6|A are injective for a\nZariski open set of subspaces A.\nTo show the equivalence of 1 and 3, we use Lemma 2.3 with the point x = x0 .\nWe have x0 \u2208 g * X\u03c0\u25e6 if and only if g = b1 (\u03c0\u0303 \u2032 )\u22121 for some b1 \u2208 B, and x0 \u2208 g\u2032 G\u2032 /B \u2032 if\nand only if g\u2032 = b2 h, for b2 \u2208 B, h \u2208 G\u2032 . Put b = b\u22121\n2 b1 , and write b = at, with a \u2208 N , and\nt \u2208 T.\nThen,\n\u0001\nTx0 gX\u03c0 \u2229 Tx0 g\u2032 G\u2032 /B \u2032 = b2 * b * Tx0 (\u03c0\u0303 \u2032 )\u22121 X\u03c0 \u2229 Tx0 G\u2032 /B \u2032\n\u0001\n= b2 * (b * (\u03c0 \u2032 * b) + b)/b \u2229 g\u2032 /b\u2032\n\u0001\n= b2 * (b * Q)\u22a5 \u2229 g\u2032 /b\n\u0001\n= b2 * (a * Q)\u22a5 \u2229 g\u2032 /b\n7\n\n\fThe transversality of the intersection (a * Q)\u22a5 \u2229 g\u2032 /b is precisely the dual statement to\ncondition (2).\nApplied to the multiplication problem, Lemma 2.4 reduces to the following.\nCorollary 2.5. Let Qi = n\u2032 \u2229 (\u03c0i * b\u2032\u2212 ) be the subspace of n\u2032 whose weights are the inversion\nset of \u03c0i . Then the following are equivalent:\n1. c\u03c01 ...\u03c0s 6= 0,\n2. The sum of subspaces a1 * Q1 + * * * + as * Qs is a direct sum, for generic choices of\nai \u2208 N .\n\n2.5\n\nNecessary conditions for vanishing\n\nOur first consequence of Lemma 2.4 is the vanishing criterion.\nLemma 2.6. Let S \u2282 n be an N -submodule of n. If dim \u03c6(S) < dim(Q\u2229S), then i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\nProof. As S is N -invariant, we have that\ndim((a * Q) \u2229 S) = dim(Q \u2229 S) > dim \u03c6(S)\nfor all a \u2208 N . It follows that \u03c6|((a*Q)\u2229S) is not injective, and thus \u03c6|a*Q is not injective.\nTherefore, by Lemma 2.4, i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\nMoreover, if we take S to be a B-submodule of n then there are only finitely many\npossibilities, and we can readily calculate the dimensions of \u03c6(S) and Q \u2229 S combinatorially.\nThis is essentially the content of Theorem 4.\nRemark 2.2. From Lemma 2.6, it is possible to rederive the necessary Horn inequalities\nfor non-vanishing of Schubert calculus on Grassmannians. For more on this picture, see\n[P3].\n\n2.6\n\nDegenerating Q\n\nTo show i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0, by Lemma 2.4, it is enough to exhibit a subspace U = a * Q in the\nN -orbit through the subspace Q such that \u03c6|U is injective. Actually, because the set\n{U \u2208 Gr(dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 , n) | \u03c6|U is injective}\nis open, we can take U to be in the closure of the N -orbit through Q. Note that since Q is\na T -fixed subspace of n, the B-orbit through Q coincides with the N -orbit through Q.\nThe idea behind obtaining sufficient conditions is to look for a T -fixed subspace of n,\nU \u2208 B * Q, such that \u03c6|U is injective. We can think of the search for a suitable U as a\nprocess. Beginning with the T -fixed subspace Q \u2282 V we degenerate to another T -fixed\nsubspace U \u2208 B * Q. If \u03c6|U is not injective, we can degenerate further inside B * U , until a\nsuitable subspace is found.\nLet V = n or any B-module subquotient of n. Let V \u2032 = n or any B \u2032 -module subquotient\nof n\u2032 . Suppose we have a B \u2032 -equivariant map \u03c8 : V \u2192 V \u2032\n8\n\n\fLet Gr(V ) denote the disjoint union of all Grassmannians\nGr(V ) =\n\ndim\naV\n\nGrl (V ).\n\nl=0\n\nSince V has a B-action, so does Gr(V ).\nLet U \u2208 Gr(V ) be a subspace of V . We call the quadruple (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) good if there is\na point \u0168 \u2208 B * U such that \u03c8|\u0168 : \u0168 \u2192 V \u2032 is an injective linear map. Note that the set of\n\u0168 \u2208 Gr(V ) with \u03c6|\u0168 injective is Zariski open in Gr(V ). Thus, equivalently, (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is\ngood if there exists \u0168 \u2208 B * U such that \u03c8|\u0168 : \u0168 \u2192 V \u2032 is an injective linear map.\nIn the language of good quadruples, Lemma 2.4 states that i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0 if and only if the\nquadruple (Q, n, n\u2032 , \u03c6) is good.\n2.6.1\n\nMoving between fixed points\n\nFor any T -representation U with distinct weights, let \u0393(U ) denote the set of weights of U .\nTo every \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206+ , we can associate a one dimensional unipotent subalgebra N\u03b2 \u2282 N ,\nwhose Lie algebra n\u03b2 is T -invariant with weight \u03b2. N\u03b2 is isomorphic to the additive Lie\ngroup C. Let \u03b8\u03b2 : C = N\u03b2 \u0592\u2192 N denote the inclusion of groups, \u03b8\u03b2 (t) = exp te\u03b2 .\nThe following proposition is a triviality, yet it is at the very heart of the root game.\nProposition 2.7. Let U \u2208 Gr(V ), and let U 1 = limt\u2192\u221e \u03b8\u03b2 (t) * U . If (U 1 , V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is good,\nthen (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is good.\nProof. The point (U 1 , V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) lies in the closure of B * U . Thus if there exists \u0168 \u2208 B * U 1\nsuch that \u03c8|\u0168 is injective, then \u0168 also lies in B * U .\nRemark 2.3. In particular if \u03c8|U 1 happens to be injective then (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is good. Otherwise we can attempt to apply Proposition 2.7 recursively to (U 1 , V, V \u2032 , \u03c8), to show that\n(U 1 , V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is good and hence that (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) is good.\nSuppose now that U is a T -fixed point of Gr(V ). We show that U 1 is a T -fixed point\nof Gr(V ) and calculate the weights \u0393(U 1 ) in terms of \u0393(U ).\nDefinition 2.4. Call an element \u03b1 \u2282 \u0393(U ) \u03b2-shiftable, if there is a positive integer k\nsuch that \u03b1 + k\u03b2 \u2208 \u0393(V ) \\ \u0393(U ). Let \u0393(U ) \u229e\u0393(V ) \u03b2 denote the set\n{\u03b1 + \u03b2 | \u03b1 is \u03b2-shiftable} \u222a {\u03b1 | \u03b1 is not \u03b2-shiftable}\nLemma 2.8. Let U 1 = limt\u2192\u221e \u03b8\u03b2 (t) * U . Then U 1 is a T -fixed point of Gr(V ) and \u0393(U 1 ) =\n\u0393(U ) \u229e\u0393(V ) \u03b2.\nProof. Let \u0113\u03b1 \u2208 V be a vector with weight \u03b1. Since the weights of V are distinct, we\ncan represent U as [\u0113\u03b11 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u0113\u03b1l ], and U 1 as [\u0113\u03b1\u20321 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u0113\u03b1\u2032l ], via the Pl\u00fccker embedding\nV\nGr(V ) \u0592\u2192 P ( \u2217 V ). Now\n\u03b8\u03b2 (t) * U = \u03b8\u03b2 (t) * [\u0113\u03b11 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u0113\u03b1l ],\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= (\u0113\u03b11 + t(e\u03b2 * \u0113\u03b11 )) \u2227 . . . \u2227 (\u0113\u03b1l + t(e\u03b2 * \u0113\u03b1l ))\nX\n^\n^\n=\nt|C| \u00b1\ne\u03b2 * \u0113\u03b1i \u2227\n\u0113\u03b1i\nC\u2282{1,...,l}\n\ni\u2208C\n\n9\n\ni\u2208C c\n\n\f(here e\u03b2 * is the action of n\u03b2 on V induced from the adjoint action). Now up to a non-zero\nconstant multiple,\n(\n\u0113\u03b1i +\u03b2 , if \u03b1i + \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393(V )\ne\u03b2 * \u0113\u03b1i =\n0,\notherwise.\nThis is a property of the adjoint representation which V , as subquotient of the adjoint\nrepresentation, inherits.\nWe see that a summand is non-zero only if {\u03b1i | i \u2208 C} is a subset of the set of \u03b2shiftable weights of \u0393(U ). In the limit as t \u2192 \u221e, the only term which survives is the one\nwith the highest power of t, which is precisely\n[\u00b1t#\u03b2-shiftable weights \u0113\u03b1\u20321 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u0113\u03b1\u2032l ].\n\n2.6.2\n\nSplitting into two smaller problems\n\nLet S \u2282 V be an B-submodule, and S \u2032 \u2282 V an B \u2032 -submodule. Suppose that \u03c8(S) \u2282 S \u2032 .\nLet q : V \u2192 V /S and q \u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 V \u2032 /S \u2032 denote the quotient maps.\nFrom the quadruple (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) and the submodules S, S \u2032 , we obtain two induced\nquadruples: they are (U \u2229 S, S, S \u2032 , \u03c8|S ), and (q(U ), V /S, V \u2032 /S \u2032 , \u03c8q ), where \u03c8q := q \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u25e6 q \u22121 .\n(Note that \u03c8q : V /S \u2192 V \u2032 /S \u2032 is well defined.)\nProposition 2.9. If (U \u2229 S, S, S \u2032 , \u03c8|S ), and (q(U ), V /S, V \u2032 /S \u2032 , \u03c8q ) are both good, then\n(U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c6) is good.\nProof. Let p : Gr(V ) \u2192 Gr(S) be the map p(U ) = U \u2229 S, and note that q also defines a\nsimilar map q : Gr(V ) \u2192 Gr(V /S). Note that p and q are not continuous everywhere, but\nsince S is a B-submodule, they are B-equivariant and continuous on B-orbits.\nDefine\ng(U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) := {\u0168 \u2208 B * U \u2282 Gr(V ) | \u03c8|\u0168 is injective}.\nLet gp = g(U \u2229 S, S, S \u2032 , \u03c8|S ) and gq = g(q(U ), V /S, V \u2032 /S \u2032 , \u03c8q ). If (U \u2229 S, S, S \u2032 , \u03c8|S ), and\n(q(U ), V /S, V \u2032 /S \u2032 , q \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u25e6 q \u22121 ) are good, then gp and gq are respectively dense subsets of\nthe B-orbits B * p(U ) \u2282 Gr(S) and B * q(U ) \u2282 Gr(V /S). By B-equivariance of p and q,\np\u22121 (gp ) \u2229 B * U and q \u22121 (gq ) \u2229 B * U are both dense subsets of B * U \u2282 Gr(V ).\nTake \u0168 \u2208 p\u22121 (gp ) \u2229 q \u22121 (gq ). Then \u03c8|p(\u0168 ) : \u0168 \u2229 S \u2192 S \u2032 and \u03c8q |q(\u0168 ) : q(\u0168 ) \u2192 V \u2032 /S \u2032 are\nboth injective. By elementary linear algebra, \u03c8|\u0168 : \u0168 \u2192 V \u2032 is therefore also injective, as\nrequired.\n2.6.3\n\nFactoring through an intermediate module\n\nIn Sections 3 and 4, the geometric ideas in Propositions 2.7 and 2.9 will translate into the\ncombinatorics of the root game. Our next proposition is not used, because it is not so easy\nto make combinatorial in its full generality. However, a special case of this can be nicely\nincorporated into the root game for Schubert intersection numbers; this appears in Section\n3.5.4.\n\n10\n\n\fGiven a quadruple (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8), let B\u0303 be a group such that B \u2032 \u2282 B\u0303 \u2282 B, and let \u1e7c be a\nB\u0303 module. Suppose the map \u03c8 factors as \u03c8 = \u03c82 \u25e6 \u03c81 , where \u03c81 : V \u2192 \u1e7c is B\u0303 equivariant,\nand \u03c82 : \u1e7c \u2192 V \u2032 is B \u2032 equivariant.\nProposition 2.10. If \u03c81 |U : U \u2192 \u1e7c is injective and (\u03c81 (U ), \u1e7c , V \u2032 , \u03c82 ) is good, then\n(U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c8) good.\nProof. If there exists a \u2208 B\u0303 such that \u03c82 |a*\u03c81 (U ) is injective, then \u03c8|a*U is also injective.\n\n2.7\n\nQuestions\n\nThe results of this section (Propositions 2.7, 2.9 and 2.10) provide a way of proving that\ni\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0, by producing a set of varieties (B-orbit closures on Grassmannians Gr(V )), and\nT -fixed points U on these varieties such that \u03c8|U is injective. A natural question is whether\nsuch a T -fixed point always exists if i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\nThis question as stated is somewhat vague, and can be phrased more precisely in a\ncouple of different ways. The most obvious interpretation is does there exist a suitable\nT -fixed point which can be found using only the results of this section? Less restrictively,\none might observe that successive uses of Proposition 2.7 may not find all the T -fixed points\non a B-orbit. If one includes all the T -fixed points in the picture, does a suitable T -fixed\npoint always exists? If so how does one practically find these other T -fixed points?\nThe first formulation of the question is essentially asking for a converse to Theorems 2\nand 5, and unfortunately the answer is in general no (see Section 3.5.4 for further discussion).\nThe second formulation is open and appears to be a difficult problem. In [P2] we show that\nthe answer is yes for the multiplication problem in the special case where the Schubert\nclasses are pulled back from a Grassmannian.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRoot games for Schubert intersection numbers\nOverview of the root game\n\nThe root game combinatorially encodes the geometric notions of Section 2. We discuss two\nversions of the game. In this section we will handle the special case of the vanishing problem\nof Schubert intersection numbers on G\u2032 /B \u2032 . We present the most general version (for the\nbranching problem of a general inclusion G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G) in Section 4.\nThe former is actually a special case of the latter. We present the two formulations\nseparately, since several of the rules become simplified in the root game for Schubert intersection numbers, and moreover it is convenient to encode the data slightly differently for\nthese two problems.\nThe basic overview of the game is the same for both problems. The playing field is a\nset of squares, which correspond to positive roots of G or G\u2032 . Some of the squares contain\ntokens, which get moved from square to square by the player according to certain rules. The\nset of all squares is subdivided into regions, which limit the movement of the tokens. The\nplayer alternates between subdividing the regions further (splitting), and moving around\ntokens, in an attempt to reach a winning position.\nIn Section 3.3, we shall see the connection with the geometry in Section 2.6. In short,\nthe positions of the tokens will represent the T -weights of potential degenerations of the\n11\n\n\fsubspace Q \u2282 n. The position of the tokens before and after a move will be the weights\nbefore and after a degeneration of the type in Proposition 2.7, whereas the splitting of\nregions corresponds to the type of subdivision in Proposition 2.9. Ultimately the purpose\nof the game is to search for a degeneration of Q which will allow us to easily conclude that\nc\u03c01 ...\u03c0s 6= 0 from Lemma 2.4; these will be the winning positions.\nWe advise the reader who wishes to skip directly to the more general branching root\ngame to glance first at examples 3.1 and 3.9, which illustrate how the squares arranged\nfor root systems of types A and B, as this will be essential to understanding subsequent\nexamples.\n\n3.2\n\nRules of the game\n\nRecall theR problem: given (\u03c01 . . . , \u03c0s ), the vanishing\nwhether\nP problem is to \u2032 determine\n\u2032\nl(\u03c0i ) = dim G /B , otherwise this\nc\u03c01 ...\u03c0s = G\u2032 /B \u2032 \u03c9\u03c01 * * * \u03c9\u03c0s = 0. We assume that\nintegral vanishes for dimensional reasons.\n3.2.1\n\nData of a position\n\nThe position in a root game consists of the following data:\n\u2032\n\u2022 A partition\n`s of the set of positive roots of G , i.e. R = {R1 , . . . , Rr }, such that\n\u2032\n\u2206+ = i=1 Ri . Each Ri is called a region.\n\n\u2022 A list of subsets T1 , . . . , Ts of the positive roots of G\u2032 , which we call the arrangement\nof tokens.\nWe organise these data as follows. We draw a set of squares: the squares correspond to\nthe positive roots of G\u2032 , and are arranged in a sensible way (depending on the type of G\u2032 .)\nThe squares are denoted S\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2032+ .\nExample 3.1. Suppose G\u2032 = SL(n). Let x1 , . . . , xn denote an orthonormal basis for Rn .\nThe root system \u2206\u2032 = An\u22121 is {\u03b1ij = xj \u2212 xi | i 6= j}. The positive roots are those for\nwhich i < j. We can view our squares corresponding to the positive roots as being arranged\ninside an n \u00d7 n array of squares. Let ASij denote the square in position (i, j). The relevant\nsquares are squares ASij (the square in position (i, j)), where 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n. Thus the\npositive root \u03b1ij , with i < j is assigned to the square ASij .\n\u03b112\n\n\u2206(SL(6))+ = (A5 )+ =\n\n\u03b113\n\n\u03b114\n\n\u03b115\n\n\u03b116\n\n\u03b123\n\n\u03b124\n\n\u03b125\n\n\u03b126\n\n\u03b134\n\n\u03b135\n\n\u03b136\n\n\u03b145\n\n\u03b146\n\u03b156\n\n12\n\n\fEach square may contain one or more tokens. We think of the tokens as physical objects\nwhich can be moved from one square to another. Each token has a label k \u2208 {1, . . . , s}. Two\ntokens with the same label can never be in the same square. We'll call a token labeled k a\nk-token, and write k \u2208 S\u03b1 if a k-token appears in square S\u03b1 . The subsets T1 , . . . , Ts \u2282 \u2206\u2032+\nare always defined as:\nTk := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2032+ | the square S\u03b1 contains a k-token}.\n3.2.2\n\nInitial position\n\nIn the initial position of the game, there is only one region: R = {\u2206\u2032+ }. The arrangement\nof tokens is the inversion set for \u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0s :\nTk = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2032+ | \u03c0k (\u03b1) \u2208 \u2206\u2032\u2212 }.\nExample 3.2. For G\u2032 = SL(n), \u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0s are given by permutations of 1, . . . , n. \u03b1ij is\nan inversion of \u03c0(k) if and only if \u03c0(i) > \u03c0(j). The initial position of the root game for\nG\u2032 = SL(5), \u03c01 = 21435, \u03c02 = 32154, \u03c03 = 24153 is given in Figure 1.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n3\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Initial position of the game for permutations 21435, 32154, 24153.\nFrom the initial position the player performs a sequence of splittings, which change the\nset of regions, and moves, which change the arrangement of tokens.\n3.2.3\n\nSplitting\n\nBefore each move, the player subdivides the regions R \u2208 R, according to the following rules.\nDefinition 3.3. Let A = {S\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 I} be a subset of the squares. Call A an ideal subset2\nif I is closed under raising operations, i.e. If \u03b1 \u2208 I, then \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 I, whenever \u03b1\u2032 , and \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\nare both positive roots. (Equivalently, A is a an ideal subset if and only if {e\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 I} span\nan ideal in the Lie algebra n\u2032 .)\n2\n\nThis is sometimes called an order ideal for the root poset of n\u2032 .\n\n13\n\n\fFor any ideal subset A, we define the operation of splitting along A, as follows: we\nsubdivide each region R into two regions R \u2229 A and R \u2229 Ac . (Empty regions produced in\nthis way can be ignored.) Thus R is replaced by\nR\u2032 = {R1 \u2229 A, R1 \u2229 Ac , R2 \u2229 A, R2 \u2229 Ac , . . . , Rr \u2229 A, Rr \u2229 Ac }.\nIn principle the player may split along any arbitrary collection of ideal subsets between\nmoves; however, this is inadvisable. The player should split along an ideal subset A if and\nonly if the total number of tokens in the squares of A is exactly equal to #(A). If this\ncondition is followed, each new region will always have the property that the number of\ntokens within the region is equal to the number of squares in the region. When splitting is\nperformed with every A satisfying this condition, we call the process splitting maximally.\nNo choice is involved in splitting maximally.\n3.2.4\n\nMoving\n\nAfter the regions have been split maximally, the player makes a move. A move is specified\nby a triple [k, \u03b2, R], where k \u2208 {1, . . . , s} is a choice of token label, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206\u2032+ , and R \u2208 R is\na choice of region.\nTo execute the move [k, \u03b2, R] we change the arrangement of tokens as follows. Find all\npairs of squares S\u03b1 , S\u03b1\u2032 \u2208 R such that \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 = \u03b2, and proceeding in order of decreasing\nheight of \u03b1, if a k-token occurs in the square S\u03b1 but not in S\u03b1\u2032 , move it from the first square\nto the second square.\nUsing Definition 2.4 the result of a move can be described as follows. If T1\u2032 , . . . , Ts\u2032\nrepresents the arrangement of tokens after the move [k, \u03b2, R], then for any region R\u2032 \u2208 R,\n(\nTj \u2229 R \u2032 ,\nif R\u2032 6= R or j 6= k\n\u2032\n\u2032\nTj \u2229 R =\n(Tk \u2229 R) \u229eR \u03b2 otherwise.\n3.2.5\n\nPlay of the game\n\nBeginning with the initial position, the player alternates between splitting maximally (to\nsubdivide the regions), and making a move to change the arrangement of tokens.\nDefinition 3.4. The game is won if at any point there is exactly one token in each square.\nObserve that a token can only ever move from a square S\u03b1 to S\u03b1\u2032 , where \u03b1\u2032 is a higher\nroot than \u03b1. So, for example, if there are two tokens in the square corresponding to the\nhighest root, there is no point in proceeding further. More generally, the game is lost if\nthere is an ideal subset A such that the the total number of tokens in A is more than #(A).\nAn important special case is when the initial configuration of tokens is a losing position.\nAn example of this is shown in Figure 2.\nDefinition 3.5. If the game is lost before the first move is made, we say the game is\ndoomed.\nNote that, while a doomed game cannot be won, it is not the case that all games which\ncannot be won are doomed (as seen in Section 3.4.2).\n14\n\n\f2\n\n111111\n000000\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n3\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: The initial position for permutations 23154, 41235, 13542 is a losing position, as\nthere are there are 7 tokens in the 6 shaded squares.\n\n3.2.6\n\nVanishing and non-vanishing criteria\n\nFrom games which are doomed, and games which can be won, we obtain vanishing and\nnon-vanishing criteria respectively.\nTheorem 1. If the root game corresponding to (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0s ) is doomed, then c\u03c01 ...\u03c0s = 0.\nTheorem 2. If the root game corresponding to (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0s ) can be won, then c\u03c01 ...\u03c0s \u2265 1.\nRemark 3.6. It is also possible to play the game, omitting the splitting stage. This simplifies the combinatorics considerably, and Theorem 2 still holds. However, as mentioned\nalready, it is always advisable to split maximally between moves. It is easy to show that if\nthe game can be won by omitting the splitting step, it can be still be won while including it\n(c.f. Section 3.5.1).\nRemark 3.7. In the case where the game is doomed as a result of an ideal subset A which\nis maximal (i.e. A consists of all squares except for a single S\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is a simple root),\nTheorem 1 reduces to the DC-triviality vanishing condition in [Kn].\nTheorems 1 and 2 cast a large net over the set of all Schubert problems, and capture a\nhuge number of them. It is not hard to see, for instance, that the probability of finding a\nnon-doomed game at random for SL(n) tends to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. Still there is a small gap:\nin general, not being able to win the game does not provide any information. However, in\na number special cases, we have been able to show that the converse of Theorem 2 holds.\nThese are discussed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.3\n\nRelating the combinatorics and geometry\n\nGiven an arrangement of tokens, T1 , . . . , Ts , and a region R \u2208 R, we associate the following\nlinear spaces.\n15\n\n\f\u2022 A B \u2032 -module V \u2032 , a subquotient of n\u2032 , such that R is the set of distinct T \u2032 -weights of\nV \u2032.\n\u2022 For each i = 1, . . . , s, a linear subspace Ui \u2282 V \u2032 such that Ti \u2229 R is the set of T \u2032\nweights of Ui .\nPut V = V \u2032 \u2295 * * * \u2295 V \u2032 (s-summands), and U = U1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Us \u2282 V .

Thus we have a quadruple\n(U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c6), as in Section 2.6.\nAt any position in the game, there is one such quadruple for every region. Recall\nthe notion of a good quadruple from Section 2.6. In our current context, the quadruple\n(U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c6) is good if and only if there exist a1 , . . . , as \u2208 N such that a1 *U1 \u2295* * *\u2295as *Us = V \u2032 .\nA position is a winning position if and only if U1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Us = V \u2032 for every region. In\nparticular, the quadruples associate to winning positions are good.\nTo prove Theorem 2, we show that if the quadruple associated to every region is good,\nthen the quadruple associated to initial position is good. This is true essentially because\nthe moves and splittings combinatorially encode the geometric ideas in Propositions 2.7 and\n2.9. A move in the root game changes U (for a single region) to a new subspace U 1 \u2282 V \u2032 in\nexactly the manner prescribed by Proposition 2.7. Thus, if the new quadruple (U 1 , V, V \u2032 , \u03c6)\nis good, then old quadruple (U, V, V \u2032 , \u03c6) must be good too. Similarly a splitting changes\nthe set of quadruples following Proposition 2.9. Hence from a winning position (where all\nregions correspond to good quadruples), we can backtrack all the way to the start the game\nand deduce that the initial position is good.\nNow, the statement that the initial position is good is precisely condition 2 of Corollary\n2.5. Thus, by Corollary 2.5, the initial position is good if and only if c\u03c01 ...\u03c0s 6= 0.\nMany of the details have been omitted here. A more precise account of relationship\nbetween the geometry and combinatorics is given in the proofs in Section 4.5.\n\n3.4\n3.4.1\n\nExamples\nGames which can be won\n\nIn type A, for any fixed \u03b2 = \u03b1ij , the possible squares involved in a move corresponding to \u03b2\nare {S\u03b1kl | k = i or l = i} \u222a {S\u03b1kl | k = j or l = j}. These squares lie on two reflected lines\nwhich meet at the square S\u03b2 (shown as dotted lines in Figures 3 and 4). The tokens move\nstrictly horizontally or vertically from one reflected line the other.\nFigure 3 shows a sequence of moves in a game which has been played without the\nsplitting step, to better illustrate the movement of the tokens. The initial position is\n(21435, 32154, 24153), from Figure 1. The sequence of moves leads to a winning position.\nFigure 4 gives an example of a sequence of moves with maximal splitting in between\nmoves. Again the sequence of moves leads to a winning position.\n3.4.2\n\nConverses and counterexamples\n\nThe converse of Theorem 1 is certainly not true. The first counterexamples in SL(n) occur\nfor n = 4.

The game is not doomed, though c\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 = 0. All other SL(4)\ncounterexamples are similar to this one.\n\nIf the root game is played without splitting, the converse of Theorem 2 is not true. The\nfirst counterexamples in SL(n) occur for n = 5. Figure 6 shows the initial position of the\ngame for the permutations 23145, 14253, 41523. There is only one square with 2 tokens,\nand one empty square. Without splitting, any effort to rectify this imbalance winds up\nmoving more than just one token. However, with splitting, the game can be won.\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nFigure 6: The permutations 23145, 14253, 41523 give a counterexample to the converse of\nTheorem 2, if the game is played without splitting.

In this example, \u03c01 = 1\u030432, \u03c02 = 231, \u03c03 = 1\u03042\u03043. The\nroot \u03b2 which is used in each move is the crossing point of the dotted lines.\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 7 gives an example of a root game for SO(7, C). Here, an element of Weyl group\nW = C23 \u22ca S3 can be represented by a permutation a1 a2 a3 of 123, where each symbol is\neither decorated with a bar or not. This permutation acts on R3 by the matrix whose ith\nrow is xai if i is unbarred, and \u2212xai if i is barred.\nArrows in Figure 7 are included not only for all tokens that move, but for all pairs of\nroots \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , whose difference is \u03b2. Since the game can be won using the moves shown, for\n\u03c01 = 1\u030432, \u03c02 = 231, \u03c03 = 1\u03042\u03043 we have c\u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 \u2265 1.\n\n3.5\n3.5.1\n\nRemarks\nSplitting\n\nIn the rules of the root game, we are told exactly when to split regions: we split along an\nideal subset A if and only if the number of tokens in A equals #(A). However, it turns out\nthat this condition is never used in the proof. Thus, in theory, the rules could be relaxed\nso that the player has the option to split regions along any ideal subset A between moves.\nThat said, we will now sketch a proof that it is never advantageous to the player to exercise\nthis freedom.\nSuppose the rules tell us not to split along A. If we do split along A there will be too\nmany tokens in one region. Since regions can never be rejoined once they are split, the\ngame cannot be won. On the other hand, suppose the rules tell us to split along A, and\nthe player chooses not to. Of any move that is made subsequently, one of the following\ntwo things must be true: either the same arrangement of tokens could have been reached\n(possibly using multiple moves) if we had split along A, or the move caused the game to be\nlost.\nThe ability to P\ndetermine, a priori when splitting is advantageous, relies on the fact that\nwe have assumed si=1 l(\u03c0i ) = dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 .\n3.5.2\n\nProducts which are not top degree\n\nThe root game can be adapted to analyse the non-vanishing of a product of Schubert classes,\nwhether or not the product is not of top degree. This greater generality is handled by the\nroot game for branching Schubert calculus, so we will not discuss it at length. However\nonly two minor modifications to the rules are required. First, we must change the winning\ncondition to read \"the game is won if there is at most one token in each square\", rather\nthan \"... exactly one token in each square\". (The losing and doomed conditions remain as\nstated previously.) Second, we must remove the rule forcing us to split maximally between\nmoves, and instead have splitting be at the player's discretion, as discussed in Section 3.5.1.\n3.5.3\n\nRelationship with the Bruhat order\n\nFor products of only two Schubert classes, the converse of Theorem 2 holds: being able to\nwin the root game both necessary and sufficient for non-vanishing. In this case, the nonvanishing of the product is determined precisely by the Bruhat order. That is, \u03c9\u03c01 * \u03c9\u03c02 6= 0\nif and only if \u03c01 \u2264 w0 \u03c02 in the Bruhat order.\nIn the case where the product is top degree, i.e. l(\u03c01 ) + l(\u03c02 ) = dim G/B, the fact that\nwe can win the root game is a triviality: we have \u03c01 \u2264 w0 \u03c02 if and only if \u03c01 = w0 \u03c02 , in\n22\n\n\fwhich case the set of squares containing a 1-token is the complement of the set of squares\ncontaining a 2-token. Thus the initial position of the game is already a winning position.\nLess trivial is the case when \u03c01 < w0 \u03c02 . Since the product of the classes is not top degree,\nwe must use the revised notion of winning position (see Section 3.5.2). Nevertheless, we\nhave the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. \u03c9\u03c01 * \u03c9\u03c02 6= 0 if and only if it is possible to win the root game corresponding\nto (\u03c01 , \u03c02 ).\nA detailed proof of this result is given in the author's doctoral thesis [P2].\n3.5.4\n\nConverses and computations\n\nIt would be quite surprising and remarkable if the converse of Theorem 2 were true in any\ngenerality. So far, for SL(n), the converse has deftly eluded any counterexamples. In fact\nthe converse of Theorem 2 has been affirmed by an exhaustive computer search for SL(n)\nfor n \u2264 7. The converse of Theorem 2 (with s = 3) has also been verified for the exceptional\ngroup G2 , as well as for SO(5) and SO(7). (The next smallest exceptional group, F4 , is\nunfortunately beyond our computational abilities at the moment.)\nOne special case where the converse of Theorem 2 is true is when the classes \u03c9\u03c0i are\npulled back from a Grassmannian in an appropriate way. We prove this result in [P1].\nAnother special case is Theorem 3, which tells us that the converse is true for products of\nonly two Schubert classes.\nFor the groups SO(n), n \u2265 8, the converse of Theorem 2 is in fact false. For SO(8), we\nrepresent an element of the Weyl group W = C23 \u22ca S4 by a permutation a1 a2 a3 a4 of 0123,\nwhere each symbol, except 0, is either decorated with a bar or not (0 is always unbarred).\nThis permutation acts on R4 by the matrix whose ith row is xai if i is unbarred, and \u2212xai\nif i is barred. The two counterexamples to the converse of Theorem 2 for SO(8) are listed\nbelow.\n\u03c01\n01\u030432\n031\u03042\n\n\u03c02\n02\u030431\n02\u030431\n\n\u03c03\n032\u03041\n02\u030431\n\nThe problem that arises in these examples is that although there exists a T -fixed point\n(U1 , U2 , U3 ) on Gr(V \u2032 )3 with U1 \u2295 U2 \u2295 U3 = V \u2032 , which is a degeneration of (a1 * P1 , a2 *\nP2 , a3 * P3 ), the moves of the game fail to find it. We are not aware of any examples in which\nc\u03c01 ...\u03c0s \u2265 1 but where there are no suitable T -fixed points on any of the relevant varieties.\nIt therefore seems it would be desirable to be able to describe a larger set of moves-moves\nwhich, starting from a T -fixed point on Gr(V \u2032 )s can reach all the other T -fixed points in\nits (N \u2032 )s -orbit closure.\nWith s = 3, a restriction one might wish to make to the root game is to allow only moves\ninvolving tokens labeled 1 and 2. This restriction seems appropriate when viewing Schubert\ncalculus as taking products in cohomology rather than intersection numbers. Under this\nweakening, Theorem 2 remains true (obviously), but the converse is already false for SL(n).\nThere are no examples of this for n \u2264 5; however, for n = 6 there are a total of four such\nexamples:\n23\n\n\f\u03c01\n145326\n154326\n514326\n154236\n\n\u03c02\n321564\n312564\n152364\n312654\n\n\u03c03\n315264\n315264\n135264\n315264\n\nIt is possible dispose of these SL(6) counterexamples, by introducing new moves geometrically based on Proposition 2.10. One such move (called a merge) is the following: select\na region R, and a pair of token labels: k1 6= k2 , with the property that there is no square\nin R which contains both a k1 -token and a k2 -token. Then replace every k2 -token with a\nk1 -token in the same square. If we introduce merges into the root game, the aforementioned\ncounterexamples disappear. Moreover, it follows (though we omit the proof here) that the\nconverse of Theorem 2 (with merges included) is true for SL(6) for any s.\n\n4\n\nRoot games for branching Schubert calculus\n\nWe now describe the root game for the more general branching problem. We will see that\nalthough the setup is slightly different, this game specialises to the root game for vanishing\nof Schubert intersection numbers.\nThe main differences we shall see are the following:\n1. Squares correspond to positive roots of G rather than G\u2032 .\n2. Tokens do not have labels.\n3. The winning condition is defined in terms of the map \u03c6\u0302 : \u2206+ \u2192 \u2206\u2032+ \u222a {0} (which we\ncalculate explicitly in a number of examples).\n4. Splitting is more complicated-it also involves \u03c6\u0302.\n\n4.1\n\nThe map \u03c6\u0302\n\nRecall the definition of the map \u03c6\u0302 from Section 2.1. The rules of the game heavily involve \u03c6\u0302;\nthus before proceeding further, we compute this map in a number of important examples.\nExample 4.1. If G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G1 , . . . , G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 Gs , then G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G = G1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gs via the diagonal\nmap. Let \u03c6\u0302i : \u2206(Gi )+ \u2192 \u2206\u2032 \u222a {0} denote the map on root systems for G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 Gi . The\npositive roots of G are \u2206+ = \u2206(G1 )+ \u2294 * * * \u2294 \u2206(Gs )+ , and\n\u03c6\u0302 : \u2206+ \u2192 \u2206\u2032+ \u222a {0}\nis simply given by \u03c6\u0302(\u03b1) = \u03c6i (\u03b1) if \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(Gi )+ .\nIn particular, if G\u2032 = G1 = * * * = Gs , then each \u03c6\u0302i is just the identity map. Thus\nthis example allows us to deal with the vanishing problem for multiplication of Schubert\ncalculus.\n\n24\n\n\f\u03b234\n\n\u03b224\n\n\u03b214\n\n\u2032\n\u03b214\n\n\u2032\n\u03b224\n\n\u03b223\n\n\u03b213\n\n\u2032\n\u03b213\n\n\u2032\n\u03b223\n\n\u03b212\n\n\u2032\n\u03b212\n\n\u2032\n\u03b234\n\u2032\n\u03b234\n\u2032\n\u03b223\n\n\u2032\n\u03b224\n\n\u2032\n\u03b212\n\n\u2032\n\u03b213\n\n\u2032\n\u03b214\n\n\u03b212\n\n\u03b213\n\n\u03b214\n\n\u03b223\n\n\u03b224\n\u03b234\n\nFigure 8: The map \u03c6\u0302 : \u2206(SL(8))+ \u2192 \u2206(SO(8))+ \u222a {0}.

Since SL(3) is simply\nconnected, this defines a homomorphism on the Lie groups (and this map is an inclusion).\nThe map \u03c6\u0302 : (G2 )+ \u2192 (A2 )+ \u222a {0} is therefore\n(\n0,\nif \u03b1 is a short root of G2\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03b1) =\n\u03b1,\nif \u03b1 is a long root of G2 .\nWe arrange the squares of G in a linear fashion, with the short simple root at the bottom,\nand the long simple root on the left.

Each Ri is called a region.\n\n\u2022 A subset T of the positive roots of G, which we call the arrangement of tokens.\n\nWe visualise this information by drawing a square S\u03b1 for each positive root \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ ,\nand placing a token in S\u03b1 if \u03b1 \u2208 T . As before, we arrange the squares in a sensible manner\ndepending on the type of G (see Examples 3.1, 3.8 and 3.9).\nThe regions are just sets of the squares. As such, if R is a region, we will sometimes\nwrite S\u03b1 \u2208 R rather than \u03b1 \u2208 R.\n4.2.2\n\nInitial configuration\n\nThe game always begins with a single region (R = {\u2206+ }), which contains all the squares.\nThe initial arrangement of tokens is the inversion set of \u03c0, i.e.\nT = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ | \u03c0 * \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 }.\nExample 4.6. If G = SL(5) \u00d7 SO(5), \u03c0 = (23154, r\u03b31\u25e6 ) where r\u03b31\u25e6 ) is the reflection in the\nsimple root \u03b31\u25e6 . Then the initial position is as shown below:\nSL(5)\nSO(5)\n\n28\n\n\f4.2.3\n\nSplitting\n\nWe define splitting along A as in Section 3.2.3: if A \u2282 \u2206+ , splitting R = {R1 , . . . , Rr } along\nA produces\nR\u2032 = {R1 \u2229 A, R1 \u2229 Ac , R2 \u2229 A, R2 \u2229 Ac , . . . , Rr \u2229 A, Rr \u2229 Ac }.\n(Empty regions have no effect on the game, thus we may discard any copies of the empty\nset produced in this way.)\nThe subsets A \u2282 \u2206 which can be legally used for splitting are called splitting subsets.\nDefinition 4.7. Let A \u2282 \u2206+ be a subset of the positive roots of G. We call A a splitting\nsubset if A is an ideal subset (c.f. Definition 3.3), and \u03c6\u0302(Ac ) \u2229 \u03c6\u0302(A) \u2282 {0}.\nExample 4.8. For SO(n) \u0592\u2192 SL(n), a set A \u2282 \u2206+ is an ideal subset if for every square S\nin A, A contains all squares above and to the right of S. A is a splitting subset if it is an\nideal subset which is symmetrical about the antidiagonal.\n4.2.4\n\nMoves\n\nA move is specified by a pair [\u03b2, R], where \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206+ , and R \u2208 R is a choice of region.\nTo execute the move, we find all pairs of squares S\u03b1 , S\u03b1\u2032 \u2208 R such that \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 = \u03b2. We\nthen order the relevant S\u03b1 according to the height of the root \u03b1. Proceeding in order of\ndecreasing height of \u03b1, if a token appears in the square S\u03b1 but not in S\u03b1\u2032 , move the token\nup from the first square to the second square.\nEquivalently, using Definition 2.4 the result of a move can be described as follows. If T \u2032\nrepresents the arrangement of tokens after the move [\u03b2, R], then for any region R\u2032 \u2208 R,\n(\nT \u2229 R\u2032 ,\nif R\u2032 6= R\nT \u2032 \u2229 R\u2032 =\n(T \u2229 R) \u229eR \u03b2. otherwise\n4.2.5\n\nPlay of the game\n\nBeginning with the initial configuration, the player performs a sequence of moves and splittings. Moves and splittings may be performed in any order. Splitting along A is permissible\nwhenever A is a splitting subset.\nDefinition 4.9. The game is won if the arrangement of tokens T is injective (c.f. Definition 2.1).\nRemark 4.10. Splitting along A is permissible whenever A is a splitting subset. However,\nwhen l(\u03c0) = dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 , one can determine a priori whether splitting will help us win the\nroot game. It turns out that if l(\u03c0) = dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 , the splitting is advantageous if and only\nif #(T \u2229 A) = #(\u03c6\u0302(A) \\ {0}). The argument is analogous to the one given in Section 3.5.1.\nFrom certain positions it may be impossible for victory to be attained. In particular, if\nA is an ideal subset, then any token which begins its move in A must remain in A. Thus\n#(T \u2229 A) can never decrease over a sequence of moves. Suppose then, at some position in\nthe game, there is an ideal subset A such that #(T \u2229 A) > #(\u03c6\u0302(A) \\ {0}). Then T is not\n29\n\n\finjective, and will never be injective; thus the game cannot be won. In such a position, we\ndeclare the game to be lost.\nThe situation when the game is lost before any moves are made, is particularly important.\nDefinition 4.11. The game is doomed if it is lost in the initial token arrangement.\n4.2.6\n\nVanishing and non-vanishing criteria\n\nVanishing and non-vanishing criteria arise from games which are doomed, and games which\ncan be won. Games which are lost, or simply cannot be won provide no information.\nTheorem 4. If the game is doomed, then i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\nTheorem 5. If the game can be won, then i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0.\nTheorems 4 and 5 specialise to Theorems 1 and 2, taking i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192 G = G\u2032 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 G\u2032 to\nbe the diagonal inclusion (see Section 4.4).\n\n4.3\n4.3.1\n\nExamples\nA corollary of Theorem 4\n\nExample 4.12. Let G = SL(n) and G\u2032 = SO(n). Let \u03c0 : {1, . . . , n} \u2192 {1, . . . , n} \u2208 Sn . If\n\u03c0(n) < \u03c0(1) then i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\nProof. To see this, observe that A = {\u03b11n } is an ideal subset, whose image under \u03c6\u0302 is {0}.\nThus #(\u03c6\u0302(A) \\ {0}) = 0. If \u03c0n < \u03c01 , then \u03b11n \u2208 T , so #(T \u2229 A) = 1 and the game is\ndoomed.\n4.3.2\n\nGames which can be won\n\nExample 4.13. If g\u2032 a is T -invariant subspace of g, and \u03c6\u0302\u22121 ({0}) is an ideal subset, then\nthe initial position is a winning position if and only if the game is not doomed, giving a\nsimple necessary and sufficient condition for i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0. Unfortunately this only occurs\nwhen the Dynkin diagram of G\u2032 is obtained by deleting some of the vertices of G's Dynkin\ndiagram. Some common examples include SL(k) \u0592\u2192 SL(n), SO(2k + 1) \u0592\u2192 SO(2n + 1) and\nSO(2k) \u0592\u2192 SO(2n), for k < n.\nExample 4.14. Let G = SL(5) \u00d7 SO(5), \u03c0 = (23154, r\u03b31\u25e6 ). The initial position is shown in\nExample 4.6. We can win the game with one move, and no splittings. The move corresponds\n\u2032 .\nto the root \u03b32\u25e6 \u2208 (B2 )+ . This causes the token on the SO(5) part to move from \u03b31\u25e6 to \u03b312\nSL(5)\nSO(5)\n\n30\n\n\fTo see that this is a winning position, we fold the SL(5) picture along the antidiagonal (this\nis \u03c6\u0302 : (A4 )+ \u2192 (B2 )+ ).\nSL(5) folded\nSO(5)\n\n(The '\u00d7's denote the diagonal of the folding map.) We then superimpose the two (B2 )+\npictures which this folding produces (this is \u03c6\u0302 : (B2 )+ \u00d7 (B2 )+ \u2192 (B2 )+ ). Since no tokens\noverlap in this process, or appear on the diagonal of the folding map (= \u03c6\u0302\u22121 ({0})), this is\na winning position.\nExample 4.15. Let G = SL(7) \u00d7 SO(7), G\u2032 = SO(7), \u03c0 = (1425736, 2\u030431\u0304), where 2\u030431\u0304 is\nthe SO(7) Weyl group element represented by the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u22121 0\n\uf8ed0\n0 1\uf8f8 .\n\u22121 0 0\n\nFigure 11 shows a sequence of splittings and moves lead to a winning position. Squares\nbelonging to the same region are similarly shaded. For each move, the relevant region is\noutlined, and the relevant root is indicated by an asterisk in the corresponding square.\nExample 4.16. Let G = G2 \u00d7SL(3), and G\u2032 = SL(3) including diagonally, where SL(3) \u0592\u2192\nG2 is as described in Example 4.5. We consider all possible \u03c0 \u2208 W , with l(\u03c0) = 3 =\ndim G\u2032 /B \u2032 . There are such 11 such \u03c0 in total. Of these, 3 associated games are doomed.\nThese are \u03c0 = (r1 , 231), \u03c0 = (r2 r1 , 132), and \u03c0 = (r1 r2 r1 , 123), where r1 and r2 represent\nreflections in the short and long simple roots respectively. These are shown in Figure 12.\nThe remaining 8 games are shown in Figure 13. One can check that each of these can be\nwon. Figure 14 shows a sequence of moves from the initial position of one of these games,\n\u03c0 = (r1 r2 , 213), to a winning position. Thus the root game gives a complete answer to the\nvanishing problem for branching SL(3) \u0592\u2192 G2 .\n\n4.4\n\nSpecialisation to Schubert intersection numbers\n\nIn order to avoid proving Theorems 1 and 2 directly, we show that the formulation of the\nroot game for vanishing of Schubert intersection numbers is in fact just a special case of\nthe more general root game for branching. In the interest of brevity, we'll call these two\nformulations of the root game the I-game and the B-game respectively.\nAs has been already discussed, the correspondence comes from from putting i : G\u2032 \u0592\u2192\nG = G\u2032 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 G\u2032 , the diagonal inclusion.\n\n31\n\n\fInitial Position\n\nSO(7)\n\nSL(7)\n\nAfter Splitting\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n111111\n000\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000111\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000111\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111111\n0000\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n000\n111\n0000111\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nMove #1\n\n1111\n0000\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n000\n111\n0000111\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nMove #2\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nWinning Position\nFigure 11: A sequence of moves in the root game for SO(7) \u0592\u2192 SL(7) \u00d7 SO(7), \u03c0 =\n(1425736, 2\u030431\u0304).

In the B-game, the squares correspond to positive roots of G and the tokens are\nunlabelled. The equivalence of the two is seen from the fact that the \u2206+ is a disjoint union\nof s copies of \u2206\u2032+ . The token label in the I-game indicates which copy of \u2206\u2032+ is being used\nfor the corresponding token in the B-game.\n4.4.2\n\nWinning condition and splitting\n\nThe map \u03c6\u0302 : \u2206+ \u2192 \u2206\u2032+ \u222a {0}, is given by superimposing all the copies of \u2206\u2032+ . Since \u2206\u2032+\ncorresponds to the set of squares in the I-game, the injectivity\nto having\nP of \u03c6\u0302|T corresponds\nat most one token in each square. Since we assumed that\nl(\u03c0i ) = dim G\u2032 /B \u2032 , this is the\nsame as exactly one token in each square.\nFrom this description of \u03c6\u0302 it is also easy to see that splitting subsets of \u2206+ are in one\nto one correspondence with ideal subsets of \u2206\u2032+ .\n\n4.5\n4.5.1\n\nProofs\nProof of the vanishing criterion\n\nThe vanishing criterion (Theorem 4) is a combinatorial reinterpretation of Lemma 2.6.\nProof of Theorem 4. At the outset, {e\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 T } is a basis for the space Q. If the game is\ndoomed then there is an ideal subset A such that #(T \u2229 A) > #(\u03c6\u0302(A) \\ {0}). Let S \u2282 n be\nthe ideal generated by {e\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 A}. We have\ndim(Q \u2229 S) = #(T \u2229 A) > #(\u03c6\u0302(A) \\ {0}) = dim \u03c6(S).\nBy Lemma 2.6, we conclude that i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) = 0.\n4.5.2\n\nProof of the non-vanishing criterion\n\nThe non-vanishing criterion (Theorem 5) is essentially combinatorially encoding the geometric ideas in Propositions 2.7 and 2.9.\nProof of Theorem 5. If R \u2282 \u2206+ , we let he\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 RiB denote the B-submodule of n generated by all e\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nLet (R = {R1 , . . . , Rr }, T ) be a position in the root game. We associate to this position\nthe following geometric data:\n\u2022 B-modules Vi , i = 1, . . . , r. Put Vi0 = he\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 Ri iB , and Vi1 = he\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(Vi0 )\\Ri iB .\nThen we define Vi to be the quotient Vi0 /Vi1 . Note that Vi is a B-module, and a\nsubquotient of n, with weights \u0393(Vi ) = Ri .\n\u2022 B \u2032 -modules Vi\u2032 , i = 1, . . . , r, defined as Vi\u2032 = \u03c6(Vi0 )/\u03c6(Vi1 ).\n\u2022 B \u2032 -equivariant maps \u03c6i : Vi \u2192 Vi\u2032 , induced from \u03c6|Vi .\n\n34\n\n\f\u2022 Subspaces Ui \u2282 Vi . Ui is defined to be the T -invariant subspace of Vi with weights\n\u0393(Ui ) = T \u2229 Ri .\nThus, for each region Ri , i \u2208 {1, . . . , r} we have a quadruple (Ui , Vi , Vi\u2032 , \u03c6i ) (as in Section\n2.6). Note that the quadruple corresponding to the initial position is (Q, n, n\u2032 , \u03c6).\nWe claim that if a root game can be won, then every such quadruple encountered over\nthe course of the game is good. In particular the initial position is good, which, by Lemma\n2.4 implies that i\u2217 (\u03c9\u03c0 ) 6= 0.\nFirst, we note that the quadruples (Ui , Vi , Vi\u2032 , \u03c6i ) associated to a winning position are\ngood. Indeed, if T is injective, then \u03c6i |Ui : Ui \u2192 Vi\u2032 is an injective linear map, thus\n(Ui , Vi , Vi\u2032 , \u03c6i ) is good.\nTo establish the claim we must show two things:\n(i) Suppose (R, T ) is the position of a root game before a move [\u03b2, Rj ], and (R, T \u2032 ) is\nthe position after the move. If all quadruples associated to (R, T \u2032 ) are good, then all\nquadruples associated to (R, T ) are good.\n(ii) Suppose (R, T ) is the position of a root game before splitting along a splitting subset\nA, and (R\u2032 , T ) is the position after the splitting. If all quadruples associated to (R\u2032 , T )\nare good, then all quadruples associated to (R, T ) are good.\nProof of (i): All quadruples (Ui , Vi , Vi\u2032 , \u03c6i ), i 6= j, are unchanged by the move [\u03b2, Rj ]. The\nposition (Uj , Vj , Vj\u2032 , \u03c6j ), however, is changed to (Uj1 , Vj , Vj\u2032 , \u03c6j ), where \u0393(Uj1 ) = \u0393(Uj )\u229eRj \u03b2.\nBy Lemma 2.8, Uj1 = limt\u2192\u221e \u03b8\u03b2 (t) * Uj , and thus (i) follows by Proposition 2.7.\nProof of (ii): Let S = he\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 Ai be the ideal of n corresponding to A. Let Si be the\ncorresponding submodule of Vi : Si = S \u2229 Vi0 /Vi1 . Put Si\u2032 = \u03c6i (Si ). We let qi : Vi \u2192 Vi /Si ,\nand qi\u2032 : Vi\u2032 \u2192 Vi\u2032 /Si , denote the quotient maps.\nThe result of splitting the region Ri \u2208 R along A is two regions: Ri \u2229 A and Ri \u2229 Ac . Let\n(Ui , Vi , Vi\u2032 , \u03c6i ) be the quadruple associate to Ri . Then the quadruple associated to Ri \u2229 A is\n(Ui \u2229 Si , Si , Si\u2032 , \u03c6i |Si ), and the quadruple associated Ri \u2229 Ac (q(Ui ), Vi /Si , Vi\u2032 /Si\u2032 , qi\u2032 \u25e6\u03c6i \u25e6qi\u22121 ).\n(The latter, is because A is a splitting subset (not merely an ideal subset), thus \u03c6 respects\nnot just the weight spaces of Si , Si\u2032 , but also the complementary weight spaces.) Using\nProposition 2.9, (ii) follows.\n\nReferences\n[B]\n\nP. Belkale, Geometric Proofs of Horn and Saturation Conjectures, J. Alg. Geom. 15\n(2006), no. 1, 133\u2013173.\n\n[BS]\n\nA.
