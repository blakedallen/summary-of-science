The modification of\nhard jets traversing a hot and dense nuclear medium is evaluated by consistently taking into account\ninduced gluon radiation and elastic collisions.

Our results demonstrate that the interaction between the hard\njets and the soft medium is important for the study of photon production and of photon-hadron\ncorrelation at RHIC.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHard processes are regarded as good tools for the tomographic study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and\nof the quark-gluon plasma: The energetic probes are created in the early stage of the collisions and can therefore access the space-time history of the transient hot\nand dense nuclear medium created in these collisions.\nLarge transverse momentum partons have been identified as especially useful because they interact directly\nwith the nuclear medium, and will lose energy in the process. The partonic jets which emerge will fragment into\nthe hadrons which are observed in the detectors. Experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\nat Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) have indeed\nshown that high-pT hadrons in central A+A collisions\nare significantly suppressed in comparison with those in\nbinary-scaled p+p interactions [1, 2, 3]. Those results\nare commonly referred to as \"jet-quenching\".\nA lot of effort has been devoted to describe the energy loss experienced by the color charges inside the hot,\nstrongly interacting matter. Gluon bremsstrahlung with\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) [4] effect has\nbeen proposed as the dominant mechanism for the jetquenching process, and different theoretical formalisms\nhave been elaborated to describe the hard parton energy\nloss [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Several of these\nbremsstrahlung calculations were compared against each\nother [16, 17, 18, 19], using a relativistic ideal (3+1)dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the strongly\ninteracting medium [20]. This implementation improved\nupon earlier attempts relying on simple schematic models by building on a detailed and realistic description of\nthe time evolution. Another potentially important energy loss mechanism for high-pT color charges is provided by scattering off thermal partons, in binary elastic collisions. Estimations of the relative magnitude of\ncollisional versus radiative energy loss have also been\nperformed in several different approaches and scenarios\n[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In Ref. [29], a study of\n\nradiative and collisional energy loss was carried out in a\ngiven single approach (AMY [13, 14, 15]). Note that the\ncollisional energy loss was further improved upon in Ref.\n[30].\nComplementary to hadronic species, photons represent another set of promising observables with the potential of probing the quark-gluon plasma (see, for example, [31] and references therein). Since they carry no\ncolor charge, once produced, they will essentially escape\nfrom the collision zone without further interaction with\nthe surrounding nuclear medium, reflecting directly local\nmedium properties. However, the experimental observation of produced photons in high energy nuclear collisions involves the entire evolution of the collision, together with a variety of sources. Considering that the\nbackground contribution from meson decay may in principle be experimentally subtracted, theoretical studies\nneed to include photons produced in the early collisions,\nthose involving jet-medium interactions during jet propagation in the medium [32], and those from fragmentation\nof the surviving jets after their escape from the medium.\nIn Ref. [33, 34], the calculation of photon production\nfrom nuclear collisions at RHIC with those different photon sources has been done by first employing a (1+1)dimensional Bjorken evolution model, and then (2+1)dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics.\nThese calculations, and others, have given rise to the\nhope that the \"tomography\" of the hot and dense core\nof the nuclear medium created in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions may be put on a firm quantitative footing.\nIn what concerns hadrons, several quantities have been\nput forward as \"tomographic variables\". One of those\nis the nuclear modification factor RAA which is inferred\nfrom the measurement of single-particle inclusive pT\nspectra. It is defined as the ratio of the hadron yield in\nA+A collisions to that in binary-scaled p+p interactions.\nSince the single-particle spectrum is a convolution of the\njet production cross section and jet fragmentation functions, the suppression of the produced hadrons at a fixed\npT involves jets with a wide range of initial transverse en-\n\n\f2\nergies; for details see [16, 29]. In retrospect, it is therefore\nnot particularly surprising that a wide variety of energy\nloss conjectures that differ significantly in the predicted\nenergy loss mechanism can reproduce\nthe measured RAA\n\u221a\nin central Au+Au collisions at s = 200 AGeV at RHIC\ngiven the present experimental errors for central collisions. In that sense, the tomographic usefulness of RAA\nin central collisions has become rather questionable [35].\nThere have been several suggestions to improve the situation. One is to consider a more differential observable,\nand study RAA in non-central collisions as a function of\nthe azimuth and pT [36]. This effectively corresponds to\nstudying an average over different paths of partons as\nthey traverse the expanding medium, which is no longer\nrotationally invariant in the transverse plane. In Ref.\n[16], RAA was also studied as a function of pT in central\nand non-central collisions at mid and forward rapidities.\nAlthough this does not restrict the initial jets' energies or\ninitial vertices, it allows for a different averaging over the\nmedium than in central collisions and can thus provide\nus with additional information.\nAnother road to improvement consists of considering\nmany-body variables, e.g. to study the production of\nhigh-pT hadrons correlated with other high-pT particles.\nOne motivation is that the correlation between the trigger particle and the measured hadrons will constrain\nthe initial energy distribution of the parton that fragments into the hadrons more tightly than single-particle\nmeasurements. One such suggested trigger is a hadron,\nsee e.g., [37]. Note however that choosing a specific\npT for the trigger hadron on the \"near-side\" still does\nnot strictly pin down the energy of the \"away-side\" partons. The trigger hadron is produced by fragmentation\nof partons that have also traversed the medium and lost\nenergy. Therefore, a specific trigger bias is introduced\ninto the away-side parton distribution and initial vertex distribution. This effect has been explored in [37],\nwhere a detailed analysis of the initial vertex density and\nconditional probability distribution P (pT ) of away-side\npartons for di-hadron correlations was presented in the\nBaier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff (BDMPS) framework of energy loss [5] by gluon bremsstrahlung. There\nit was shown that the yield of hadrons per trigger hadron\nwas sensitive to the specific assumptions about the evolution model for di-hadron correlations, while it was not\nfor RAA .\nAnother promising trigger is a high-pT photon: One\nstudies jet-quenching by measuring the pT distribution\nof charged hadrons in the opposite direction of a trigger direct photon [38, 39]. Direct photons are predominantly produced from hard collisions in the early stage\nof relativistic nuclear collisions. Assuming that a highpT direct photon from these processes can be used as a\ntrigger of the away-side hadron, the transverse energy\nof the initial away-side parton before energy loss can\nthen be deduced (up to corrections at next to leading\norder in \u03b1s ). Thus, direct photons can provide a calibrated probe for the study of the properties of high en-\n\nergy density QCD. This kind of trigger does not introduce a vertex bias and therefore weighs all vertices according to the nuclear overlap function; and it strongly\nrestricts the initial away-side partons' energy to a monoenergetic source. Given this restriction of the initial jet's\ntransverse energy, the expected tomographic capabilities\nof photon-tagged jet correlation measurements are much\nhigher than those of RAA . It has been shown in Ref. [35]\nthat while different schematic conjectures of jet energy\nlosses could not be discriminated by RAA in central collisions at mid-rapidity, they gave clearly different predictions for \u03b3-hadron correlations. Some other studies have\nalso been performed along this direction [40, 41, 42].\nHowever, jet-photon correlation calculations need to go\nbeyond direct photons and to include the other important\nand known electromagnetic sources such as fragmentation and jet-medium interaction. As the initial away-side\npartonic jets in these processes could have larger transverse energies than the near-side trigger photon, photons produced from those processes might have significant contribution to the correlations between final photons and hadrons. In this work, we consider these possibilities and incorporate a complete set of high-pT photonproduction channels and study their relative contributions to the correlations between back-to-back photons\nand hadrons.\nIn Ref. [29], we have presented a consistent calculation\nof both collisional and radiative energy loss in the same\nformalism. There it was applied to calculate the nuclear\nmodification factor RAA of neutral pions in heavy ion collisions at RHIC for different centralities at mid-rapidity.\nHere, we continue and extend this effort by studying the\neffect of jet-medium interaction on the photon production as well as on correlated back-to-back hard photons\nand hadrons in high energy nuclear collisions. We employ the formalism developed in Ref. [29] to account\nconsistently for collisional and radiative energy loss of\nthe leading hard parton while it traverses the surrounding soft nuclear matter, modeled by (3+1)-dimensional\nhydrodynamics [20].\nThis paper is organized as follows: the next two sections describe our approach to jet energy loss and to\nphoton production. Then, photon-hadron correlations\nare treated, and comparisons with experimental results\nobtained at RHIC by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations are performed.\n\nII.\n\nJET ENERGY LOSS\n\nIn our approach, hard jets (quarks and gluons) evolve\nin the soft nuclear medium according to a set of Fokker\u2013\nPlanck type rate equations for their momentum distributions P (E, t) = dN (E, t)/dE. The generic form of these\n\n\f3\nrate equations can be written as follows [33, 43],\n\u0014\nXZ\ndPj (E, t)\nd\u0393a\u2192j (E + \u03c9, \u03c9)\n=\nd\u03c9 Pa (E + \u03c9, t)\ndt\nd\u03c9dt\nab\n\u0015\nd\u0393j\u2192b (E, \u03c9)\n,\n(1)\n\u2212Pj (E, t)\nd\u03c9dt\nwhere d\u0393j\u2192a (E, \u03c9)/d\u03c9dt is the transition rate for the\npartonic process j \u2192 a, with E the initial jet energy\nand \u03c9 the energy lost in the process. The \u03c9 < 0 part\nof the integration accounts for the contribution from the\nenergy-gain channels. The radiative and collisional parts\nof the transition rates have been extensively discussed in\nRef. [16, 29, 44].\nThe initial jet momentum profiles may be computed\nfrom perturbative QCD calculations [45],\nXZ\nd\u03c3AB\u2192jX\n= Kjet\ndxa Ga/A (xa , Q)Gb/B (xb , Q)\nd2 pjT dy\nabd\n\u00d7\n\n1 2xa xb d\u03c3ab\u2192jd\n,\n\u03c0 2xa \u2212 xjT ey\ndt\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith xjT = 2pjT / sN N , where sN N is the center-ofmass energy. In the above equation, Ga/A (xa , Q) is the\ndistribution function of parton a with momentum fraction xa in the nucleus A at factorization scale Q, taken\nfrom CTEQ5 [46] including nuclear shadowing effects\nfrom EKS98 [47]. The distribution d\u03c3/dt is the leading\norder QCD differential cross section with Kjet accounting for next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections. It is\nfixed following Ref. [48] by reproducing the experimental measurement of the inclusive \u03c0 0 cross section at high\u221a\npT in in p+p collisions at sN N = 200 GeV (see Fig. 1\nin Ref.[16]). The Kjet-factor is found to be 2.8 when\nthe renormalization scale and the factorization scale are\ntaken to be the transverse momentum of the initial jets,\nand the fragmentation scale is taken to be the transverse\nmomentum of produced hadrons.\nTo obtain the final high-pT hadron spectra in Au+Au\ncollisions at RHIC, the energy loss of partonic jets in\nthe nuclear medium must be taken into account. This is\nperformed by calculating the medium-modified fragmentation function D\u0303h/j (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) for a single partonic jet,\nXZ\nz\u2032\nD\u0303h/j (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) =\ndpj \u2032 Dh/j \u2032 (z \u2032 )P (pj \u2032 |pj , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6),(3)\nz\n\u2032\nj\n\nwhere z = ph /pj and z \u2032 = ph /pj \u2032 are two momentum\nfractions with ph the hadron momentum and pj (pj \u2032 ) the\ninitial (final) jet momentum; Dh/j (z) is the vacuum fragmentation function, taken from the KKP parametrization [49]. In the above equation, the probability function\nP (pj \u2032 |pj , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) is obtained by solving Eq. (1), representing the probability of obtaining a jet j \u2032 with momentum\npj \u2032 from a given jet j with momentum pj . This depends\non the path taken by the parton and the medium profile\nalong that path, which in turn depends on the original location of the jet, ~r\u22a5 , and on its propagation angle \u03c6 with\n\nrespect to the reaction plane. Therefore, one must convolve the above expression over all transverse positions\nand directions to obtain the final hadron spectra:\nZ\nd\u03c3AB\u2192hX\n1\n=\nd2~r\u22a5 PAB (b, ~r\u22a5 )\n2\u03c0\nd2 phT dy\nX Z dz\nd\u03c3AB\u2192jX\nD\u0303 (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6)\n, (4)\n\u00d7\n2 h/j\nz\nd2 pjT dy\nj\nwhere PAB (b, ~r\u22a5 ) is the probability distribution of initial\nhard jets in the transverse position ~r\u22a5 , which is determined from the overlap geometry between two nuclei in\nthe transverse plane of the collision zone.

The most\nimportant are direct photons, fragmentation photons,\nand jet-medium photons (bremsstrahlung photons and\nconversion photons). The thermal photon emission arising from the partonic medium and later hadronic phase\nmakes a negligible contribution in the high-pT regime,\nand thus is excluded from consideration in the present\ncalculation.\nDirect photons are predominantly produced from early\nhard collisions between partons from the initial nuclei,\nvia quark-anti-quark annihilation (q + q\u0304 \u2192 g + \u03b3) and\nquark-gluon Compton scattering (q(q\u0304) + g \u2192 q(q\u0304) + \u03b3).\n\n\f4\nThe inclusive direct photon cross section may be calculated from Eq. (2) by applying the corresponding partonic processes for photon production,\ndirect\nXZ\nd\u03c3AB\u2192\u03b3X\n= K\u03b3\ndxa Ga/A (xa , Q)Gb/B (xb , Q)\nd2 p\u03b3T dy\nabd\n\n1 2xa xb d\u03c3ab\u2192\u03b3d\n,\n\u00d7\n\u03c0 2xa \u2212 x\u03b3T ey\ndt\n\nwhere m2q = gs2 T 2 /6 is the thermal quark mass and\nC2\u21922 \u2248 \u22120.36149 in the limit of E \u226b T [15, 56, 57].\nThe function \u03b4(\u03c9) represents the fact that the produced\nphoton has essentially the same energy as the incoming\nquarks (or anti-quarks) in the jet-photon conversion processes.\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\nwith x\u03b3T = 2p\u03b3T / sN N . The factor K\u03b3 is a function of\nthe photon's transverse momentum and is deduced by\nperforming an NLO calculation of photon production in\np+p collisions [51, 52, 53], in which the renormalization\nscale and the factorization scale are set to be the photon\ntransverse momentum.\nFragmentation photons are produced by the surviving\nhigh energy jets after their passing through the hot and\ndense nuclear medium. The calculation of fragmentation\nphoton spectra is similar to that of the high-pT hadron\nproduction described in the last section. We may also\ndefine a medium-modified photon fragmentation function\nD\u0303\u03b3/j (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) as in Eq.(3). Then the final expression for\nthe fragmentation photon cross section can be written as\nZ\nfrag\nd\u03c3AB\u2192\u03b3X\n1\n=\nd2~r\u22a5 PAB (~r\u22a5 )\n\u03b3\nd2 pT dy\n2\u03c0\nX Z dz\nd\u03c3AB\u2192jX\nD\u0303\u03b3/j (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6)\n. (9)\n\u00d7\n2\nz\nd2 pjT dy\nj\nwhere the vacuum fragmentation functions of quarks and\ngluons into real photons are taken from [54].\nJet-medium photons are produced by jet-medium interactions during the passage of jets through the hot nuclear medium. These include induced photon radiation\n(bremsstrahlung photons) and direct conversion from the\nhigh energy jets (conversion photons). It has been shown\nthat those two processes are important for the understanding of experimental data for photon production in\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC [32, 33, 34].\nIn order to incorporate the photons directly produced\nfrom jet-medium interaction, we may add to the set of\nevolution equations shown in Eq. (1) an additional evolution equation for photons,\nZ\nd\u0393JM\ndP\u03b3JM (E, t)\nq\u2192\u03b3 (E+\u03c9, \u03c9)\n= d\u03c9Pqq\u0304 (E+\u03c9, t)\n, (10)\ndt\nd\u03c9dt\nbrem\nconv\nwhere d\u0393JM\nq\u2192\u03b3 /d\u03c9dt = d\u0393q\u2192\u03b3 /d\u03c9dt + d\u0393q\u2192\u03b3 /d\u03c9dt. The\nbrem\ntransition rates d\u0393q\u2192\u03b3 /d\u03c9dt for photon bremsstrahlung\nprocesses are similar to gluon bremsstrahlung processes\nand are extensively discussed in [13, 14, 15]. And the\ntransition rates d\u0393conv\nq\u2192\u03b3 /d\u03c9dt for binary jet-photon conversion processes may be inferred from the photon emission rates for those processes [55],\nX \u0010 ef \u00112 2\u03c0\u03b1e \u03b1s T 2\nd\u0393conv\nq\u2192\u03b3 (E, \u03c9)\n=\nd\u03c9dt\ne\n3E\nf\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 ET\nln 2 + C2\u21922 (E/T ) \u03b4(\u03c9), (11)\n\u00d7\n2\nmq\n\nIV.\n\nPHOTON-HADRON CORRELATIONS\n\nIn this section, we present the calculation of the correlation between back-to-back hard photons and hadrons.\nThe associated hadrons are produced from the fragmentation of surviving jets after their passing through the\nnuclear medium, while the trigger photons may come\nfrom various sources as has been discussed in the previous section. Therefore, the photon\u2013hadron correlation\nwill depend on the jet-photon correlation at the production vertex as well as on the energy loss of the jets during\ntheir propagation in the medium.\nIn correlation studies, one of the commonly exploited\nobservables is the yield per trigger, which is the momentum distribution of produced hadrons on the away side,\ngiven a trigger photon of momentum p\u03b3T in the near side.\nFollowing Ref. [58], one may write\nP (phT , p\u03b3T )\n,\n(12)\nP (p\u03b3T )\nR\nwhere P (p\u03b3T ) = 1/\u03c3tot dy\u03b3 d\u03c3\u03b3 /dy\u03b3 dp\u03b3T represents\nthe single-particle\npT distribution and P (p\u03b3T , phT ) =\nR\n1/\u03c3tot dy\u03b3 dyh d\u03c3\u03b3+h /dy\u03b3 dyh dp\u03b3T dphT is the \u03b3 \u2212 h pair\npT distribution.\nThe trigger photon and the associated hadron are produced from a pair of back-to-back partons. Assuming no\ncorrelation between the individual evolutions of two partonic jets once they are produced, we may write down\nthe expressions of these two distributions as follows\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c6\n\u03b3\nd2~r\u22a5 PAB (~r\u22a5 )\nPf (pT ) =\n2\u03c0\nXZ j\n\u00d7\ndpT Pi (pjT )P (p\u03b3T |pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6),\nP (phT |p\u03b3T ) =\n\nj\n\nZ\nd\u03c6\nPf (phT , p\u03b3T ) =\nd2~r\u22a5 PAB (~r\u22a5 )\n2\u03c0\nXZ j j \u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7\ndpT dpT Pi (pjT , pjT )\nZ\n\njj \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u00d7P (p\u03b3T |pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6)P (phT |pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c0+\u03c6). (13)\nIn the above equations, Pf (p\u03b3T ) and Pf (phT , p\u03b3T ) are the\nfinal state distribution functions for single-photon and\nback-to-back photon-hadron production, while Pi (pjT )\n\u2032\nand Pi (pjT , pjT ) are the initial distributions for a jet\nor jet pair to be produced in the medium with the\ngiven momenta and species types. The yield per trigger\nP (p\u03b3T |pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) is the number of produced photons given\n\n\f5\n\nwhere the sources include direct photons, fragmentation\nphotons and jet-medium photons as described in the last\nsection. For the direct photon contribution, the nearside jet is replaced by a direct photon, so the yield\nper trigger is simply given by P (p\u03b3T , direct|pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) =\n\u03b4(p\u03b3T \u2212 pjT ). The fragmentation photon contribution is\nrelated to the medium-modified photon fragmentation\nfunction by P (p\u03b3T , frag|pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6) = D\u0303\u03b3/j (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6)/pjT ,\nwith z = p\u03b3T /pjT . Furthermore, we also need to include the contribution from jet-medium photons, which is\nachieved by solving Eq. (10), the photon evolution equation, to obtain the yield per trigger P (p\u03b3T , JM|pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6).\nNote that for the case of hadron yield per jet trigger\nP (phT |pjT , ~r\u22a5 , \u03c6), we only need to include the fragmentation contribution since we focus on high-pT hadron production.\nFor the study of photon-hadron correlations, it is often useful to define the photon-triggered fragmentation\nfunction as follows [59, 60],\n(15)\n\nwith zT = phT /p\u03b3T . In order to quantify the effect of\nthe nuclear medium on the photon-hadron correlations,\nwe may also introduce the nuclear modification factor\nIAA , which is defined as the ratio between A+A and p+p\ncollisions of the photon-triggered fragmentation function,\nDAA (zT , p\u03b3T )\n.\n=\nDpp (zT , p\u03b3T )\n\n0.2\n0\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n10\n15\npT (GeV/c)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n(16)\n\nIn the previous sections, we have outlined the theoretical formalism for calculating jet energy loss, the production of high-pT hadrons and photons, and photon-hadron\ncorrelations. In this section, we apply this methodology to study Au+Au collisions at RHIC, using a (3+1)dimensional relativistic ideal hydrodynamics [20], and\ncompare our results to available experimental measurements.\nIn Fig. 1 we show our earlier study [29] of the neutral pion RAA in Au+Au collisions at RHIC measured at\nmid-rapidity for two different impact parameters, 2.4 fm\nand 7.5 fm, compared with the experimental measurements by PHENIX [2] for the most central (0\u20135%) and\nmid-central (20\u201330%) collisions. In the calculation, the\nstrong coupling constant \u03b1s is adjusted in such a way\nthat the experimental measurement of RAA in most central collisions (upper panel) is described. The same value,\n\u03b1s = 0.27, is used throughout the calculation. (There is\nno additional parameter for the later calculation of highpT photon production and photon-hadron correlations.)\n\n25\n\nFig. 1 also compares the relative contributions of induced\ngluon radiations and elastic collisions to the final RAA .\nOne may find that while the shape does not show a strong\nsensitivity, the overall magnitude of RAA is sensitive to\nboth radiative and collisional energy loss.\n\nPHENIX\ndirect\nfragmentation\nsum\nfit\n\n10\n\nRESULTS AT RHIC\n\n20\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The nuclear modification factor RAA\nfor neutral pions in central and mid-central collisions (from\nRef.

While direct photons dominate\nthe high-pT regime (pT \u2265 6 GeV), the presence of jet-\n\nmedium interaction is a significant contribution to the total photon yield in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, especially\nin the intermediate-pT regime (pT \u2248 3\u20135 GeV). This can\nbe more easily seen in Fig. 4, where we compare our\ncalculation of photon production for b = 4.5 fm in the intermediate pT regime with 0-20% Au+Au collisions data\nfrom PHENIX [62, 63]. At very low pT (pT \u2264 2 GeV),\nthe thermal emissions from partonic and hadronic phases\nare expected to dominate [64]. This component is excluded in the calculation as we are focusing on the highpT regime. Also the assumptions essential for jet-energy\nloss calculation break down at such low pT .\nIn order to further quantify nuclear medium effects on\nphoton production in Au+Au collisions, we show in Fig.\n5 the calculated photon RAA as a function of photon\npT for central Au+Au collisions (b = 2.4 fm) at RHIC\ncompared with most 0-10% PHENIX data. The figure\nshows that RAA can be smaller than 1 even if only direct\nand fragmentation photons are included in both p+p and\nAu+Au calculations. As direct photons dominate the total yield (and thus RAA ) in the high-pT regime, the decrease of RAA at high pT is consistent with an isospin\neffect. If we include the contribution from fragmentation\nphotons in the calculation, photon RAA gets suppressed\nbecause these photons are produced from the fragmentation of the surviving jets with less energies due to the\nenergy loss of jets when they are traversing the thermalized medium. However, the presence of jet-medium interaction in Au+Au collisions (but not in p+p collisions)\nagain enhances RAA if we include them in the total photon yield. It is telling that the sharp rise of RAA at\nlow-pT originates mainly from the fact that our calculation for p+p collisions is below the data points (see Fig.\n2): a better agreement with the data is obtained with\nthe power-law fit to the p+p data used to calculate RAA .\n\n\f7\nThe additional QGP sources then manifest themselves\nin the difference between the solid and the dash-dotted\ncurves in Fig. 5. The sensitivity of RAA to this level\nof details also makes clear the need for a precise, QCDbased, quantitative understanding of photon data in p+p\ncollisions.\n\nPHENIX prelim. 0-20%\ndirect\nfragmentation\njet-medium\ndirec+frag.+jet-medium\n\nv2\n\n0.1\n\nPHENIX Prelim., pT,h = 3-5 GeV, |yh, y\u03b3| < 0.35\npT,h = 3-5 GeV\npT,h = 5-7 GeV\npT,h = 7-9 GeV\n\n-1\n\n10\nDAA (zT)\n\n0.2\n0.15\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n0.05\n-4\n\n10 0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-0.05\n-0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\npT (GeV/c)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0.6\nzT\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) The photon-triggered fragmentation\nfunction as a function of momentum fraction zT in Au+Au\ncollisions at RHIC, with b = 4.5 fm.\n\nPHENIX Prelim., pT,h = 3-5 GeV, |yh, y\u03b3| < 0.35\nFIG. 6: (Color online) The photon momentum azimuthal\nasymmetry, v2 , as a function of the photon transverse momentum.

This\ndata is show in Figure 6. It is clear that the high centrality cut will cause the momentum anisotropy to be\nsmall, and this is indeed what is observed.

A combination of isolation and centrality cuts will be needed\nto clearly isolate the predicted [67] negative contribution\n[34].\nSo far, we have just considered single jets and single\nphotons.

The experimental data\nare taken from PHENIX [68], and we have chosen those\ndata points with highest transverse momentum for associated hadrons (phT = 3\u20135 GeV) such that fragmentation\nmight be dominant for hadron production. We find that\nthe slopes of the photon-triggered fragmentation function Dpp (zT ) are slightly different for the three hadron pT\nranges. We may trace this difference back to the different\nmomentum (fraction) dependence of initial parton distribution functions (PDF) for quarks and gluons (a steeper\nslope for gluon PDF than quark PDF as a function of momentum fraction). As we increase the momenta of initial\npartons (and therefore Bjorken x) more quarks appear in\nthe initial state, so the relative importance of q q\u0304 \u2192 g\u03b3\nincreases compared to qg \u2192 q\u03b3. As a consequence, the\nphoton-triggered fragmentation function Dpp (zT ), which\nis an average over quark and gluon fragmentation functions weighted with their fractions, will become steeper,\nsince the gluon fragmentation function is steeper than\nthat for quarks.\nIn Fig. 8, we show our results for the photon-triggered\nfragmentation function DAA (zT ) in mid-central Au+Au\ncollisions (b = 4.5 fm) as a function of momentum fraction zT , compared with 0-20% data from PHENIX [68].\nThe dependence of DAA (zT ) on associated hadron pT\nis similar to Dpp (zT ) in the low zT regime because the\nassociated hadrons are mostly produced from those jets\ntriggered by direct photons (see Fig. 13). However, this\ndifference tends to decrease at high zT due to the presence\nof jet-medium interaction in Au+Au collisions. Since jetplasma photons and fragmentation photons assume more\nsignificance to photon production at lower pT (see Fig. 4),\na larger enhancement is obtained for smaller associated\nhadron pT .\nTo further quantify the nuclear medium effect on the\nphoton-triggered hadron production, we may take the ratio of DAA to Dpp and calculate the nuclear modification\nfactor IAA for photon-triggered hadron production. The\nresult is shown in Fig. 9 and compared with experimental\nmeasurement by PHENIX. At low zT , IAA falls with increasing zT due to the dominance of direct photons, but\nit flattens out at higher zT due to the effect of jet-medium\nphotons and fragmentation photons (see Fig. 13).\nAlso, we compare our calculation with STAR measurements [69]. In Fig. 10, we show the photon-triggered\nfragmentation function DAA (zT ) as a function of momentum fraction zT in central Au+Au collisions (b =\n2.4 GeV) at RHIC. The trigger photon momenta have\nbeen chosen to be p\u03b3T = 8\u201316 GeV. The theoretical curve\nof photon-triggered fragmentation function DAA (zT ) in\ncentral Au+Au collisions agrees with experimental data\nquite well. The data for peripheral (40-80%) Au+Au\ncollisions are also shown in the figure for the interest of\ncomparing with the p+p calculation.

By integrating over the transverse momenta of both trigger photons\nand associated hadrons, we study the centrality dependence of the per-trigger yield of photon-triggered hadrons\nin Au+Au collisions at RHIC. This result is plotted in\nFig. 12, where the experimental measurements are from\n\n\f9\n10\n\n0\n\npossible sources of high-pT photon production. It would\nbe interesting to study how different sources of photons\ncontribute the final photon-triggered hadron production.\nTo address this issue, we may decompose the per-trigger\nyield of hadrons into different parts, each associated with\na specific photon source,\nX\nP (phT |p\u03b3T ) =\nP (phT , src|p\u03b3T ),\n(17)\n\nSTAR Prelim., pT,\u03b3 = 8-16 GeV, |yh, y\u03b3| < 1\n-1\n\nPer-trigger yield\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nsrc\n\n10\n\n-3\n\npT,h = 4-6 GeV\npT,h = 6-8 GeV\n\n-4\n\n10 0\n\n100\n\n50\n\n200\nNpart\n\n150\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) The per-trigger yield for photontagged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at RHIC as a function\nof centrality.

In the calculation, we have chosen four different impact parameters, 2.4 fm, 4.5 fm, 6.3 fm and 7.5 fm,\nwhich correspond to four points in each theoretical curve.\nWe do not perform the calculation for very peripheral collisions because the assumption of a thermalized medium\nessential for a hydrodynamical treatment is no longer fulfilled. Again, the trigger photon pT has been chosen to\nbe p\u03b3T = 8\u201316 GeV, and two different hadron pT ranges\n(phT = 4\u20136 GeV and 6\u20138 GeV) are studied.

A similar\ndecomposition may be performed for photon-triggered\nfragmentation functions. In Fig. 13, we show the relative contributions from different photon sources to the\nphoton-triggered fragmentation function D(zT , p\u03b3T )) in\nboth p+p collisions and central Au+Au collisions (b =\n2.4 fm) if we trigger on a photon on the near side. We\nfind that about half of the away-side hadrons at relatively\nsmall zT are produced from those jets tagged by direct\nphotons, while at higher zT , a large amount of awayside hadrons come from those jets tagged by jet-medium\nphotons and fragmentation photons. Especially, close to\nzT = 1, where the associated hadrons have almost the\nsame amount of transverse momentum as the trigger photon, the away side hadron production is dominated by\nthose jets tagged by fragmentation photons. Therefore,\nit would be interesting to extend the experimental data\nto higher zT (and to high phT such that fragmentation\ndominates hadron production), where jet-medium interaction and fragmentation make a significant contribution\nto photon-hadron correlations.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work, we have studied jet energy loss and photon production at high pT together in the same framework, with additional information provided by photonhadron correlations. The energy loss of hard jets traversing the hot and dense medium is computed by a consistent incorporation of both induced gluon radiation and\nelastic collisions. The production of high pT photons is\nobtained by taking into account a complete set of photonproduction channels. Numerical results have been presented and compared with experimental measurements\nby employing a fully (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamical\nevolution model for the description of the thermalized\nmedium created at RHIC.\nOur results illustrate that the magnitude of jet quenching in relativistic nuclear collisions is sensitive to the inclusion of both radiative and collisional energy loss. It\nis also found that the interaction between jets and the\nthermalized medium makes a significant contribution to\nthe total photon production at RHIC. Therefore, it is\nimportant to incorporate all sources of hard photons for\na full understanding of the correlations between back-toback hard photons and hadrons. In summary, our study\nprovides the groundwork to experimentally test our understanding of the jet-medium interaction and further\n\n\f10\nextract detailed information about the hot and dense\nmedium created at RHIC.\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are indebted to C.
