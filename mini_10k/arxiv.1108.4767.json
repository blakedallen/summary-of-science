Introduction\nSome Jovian comets, such as Oterma, are sometimes temporarily captured by\nJupiter, making the transition from heliocentric orbits outside the orbit of Jupiter to\nheliocentric orbits inside the orbit of Jupiter. During this transition, Jupiter frequently\ncaptures the comet temporarily for one to several orbits (Koon et al. 2000). This is\nbecause the Jacobian constant of the comet is slightly lower than C1 (Jacobian constant at\nSun-Jupiter Lagrange point L1) and higher than C3 (Jacobian constant at Sun-Jupiter\n\n*\n\nThis research is supported by Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 10602027)\nBaoyin Hexi: Associate Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University.\nEmail: baoyin@tsinghua.edu.cn. Tel:62795211\n\n1\n\n\fLagrange point L3; see Fig.1 or Fig.2, case C2>C>C3). Therefore, when the comet enters\nJupiter's influence region, it can only travel through L1 and L2, two necks of the zero\nvelocity surfaces.\n\nInside Jupiter's influence region it reflects on the zero velocity\n\nsurfaces to become a temporary satellite of Jupiter. Might this also be the case with\ncertain objects and Earth?\nTo date, researchers have found thousands of Near Earth Objects and continue to\nfind more every week. While these NEOs do pose the threat of an impact with Earth, they\nalso provide us with great opportunities. A 2km-size metallic NEO, for example, may\ncontain rich metals and materials worth more than 25 trillion dollars (Hartmann et al.\n1994). The concept of mining NEOs is not new (Gaffey et al. 1977), but there is still no\nproper practical way to do it. If approaching NEOs could be temporarily captured by\nEarth, exerting a small velocity change in the capture phase to bring them into orbit\naround Earth and finding a low-cost trajectory to sample a large amount of material\nwould be one of the best ways to mine the NEOs. To deflect NEOs which are hazardous\nto Earth, different schemes have been presented, such as direct impact, mass driver,\nnuclear explosion, thrusting manoeuvres, and solar radiation (Ahrens et al. 1992;\nMcInnes 2004; Chapman 2004; Ivashkin et al. 1995). All these schemes can be used for\nchanging the orbital elements of the NEOs, but these schemes have only been examined\nwith regard to NEOs of less than one meter in size; most Near Earth Objects are quite\nlarge and in high-energy orbit.\nMany authors have studied the gravitational capture phenomenon by using\ndifferent models of celestial mechanics (Mak\u00f3 et al. 2004). Brunini et al. examined the\nconditions of capture in the restricted three-body problem. Murison studied the\n\n2\n\n\fconnections between gravitational capture and chaotic motions. Mak\u00f3 and Szenkovits\ngave some necessary conditions of not being captured by using the Hill-regions in the\nspatial elliptic restricted three-body problem.\nIn this paper, we studied the necessary conditions of capture and identified how\nthese conditions could lead to certain kinds of NEOs being captured by the Earth. Like\nOterma being captured by Jupiter, it is possible for low-energy NEOs to be temporarily\ncaptured by the Earth; moreover, it is possible for them to become Earth-orbiting objects\nafter the exertion of a small velocity increment. In our discussions of the orbital dynamics\nof the NEOs, we used the framework of an accurate solar system model when the NEOs\nwere far from any major celestial body. The Sun-Earth-NEO three-body system was\nutilized when the NEOs were approaching the Earth. From the perspective of the\nrestricted three-body system, it is possible for an NEO whose Jacobian constant is\nslightly lower than Sun-Earth C1 and higher than C3 to be temporarily captured by the\nEarth. When such an NEO approaches the Earth, it is possible to change its orbit energy\nto close up the zero velocity surfaces at point L1 (see Fig.1 or Fig.2, case C=C1; it will\nremain inside the smaller ball) and make it become a small satellite of the Earth.\nHowever, based on current technology, this may only possible with very small NEOs, as\nlarger ones are too heavy for their orbit energy to be significantly changed. Fortunately, a\npractical advantage of such low-energy NEOs is that mining them requires less fuel and\ntime than larger NEOs.\n\n2. System model\n\n3\n\n\fOrbit prediction: Because of the perturbations, especially the resonance from the planets,\nthe dynamical model only consists of Sun-Earth-NEO three body system that cannot\naccurately predict close approach of the near Earth objects. Fortunately there is some\nsoftware that can be used for predicting NEO orbit very accurately in an appropriate time\nscale. Milani et al. have developed a very accurate solar system model, in which the\ngravitational forces of all bigger celestial bodies (including the Earth and the moon,\nwhich are treated as individual bodies instead of the barycentre of Earth-Moon system) of\nthe solar system even the bigger NEOs themselves have been taken into account (Milani\net al. 2001). That model is implemented in their free software package OrbFit and its\nsource codes also can be freely downloaded from their website. This paper will use this\nsoftware to calculate the NEO orbit and to predict their close approaches.\nThe elliptical restricted three body model: When we consider the orbit change of an\nNEO as it close approaches to the Earth, the system can be seen as the Sun-Earth-NEO\nelliptical 3-dimensonal three-body system. In such a system, the Sun and the Earth\nrevolve around their common mass center in a Keplerian elliptical orbit under the\ninfluence of their mutual gravitational attraction. The NEO, of infinitesimal mass, moves\nin the 3-dimensional space under their gravitational influences.\nTo succinctly describe the elliptic restricted three-body problem, a non-uniformly\nrotating and pulsating coordinate system is used here. In this system, origin of the\ncoordinates is in the common mass center of the two massive primaries, and the x axis is\ndirected towards m1 (the Earth), the xy plane is the orbit plane of the two massive\nprimaries. Such a pulsating or oscillating coordinate system might be transformed to\n\n4\n\n\fdimensionless coordinates by using the variable distance between the primaries as the\nlength unit and the reciprocal of the variable angular velocity of the Earth as the time unit.\n[ L] \uf03d r \uf03d\n\n[T ] \uf03d\n\na(1 \uf02d e 2 )\n1 \uf02b e cos f\n\n1\nR2\n\uf03d\nf\uf026\nG (m1 \uf02b m2 )a (1 \uf02d e2 )\n\nwhere R is the mutual distance, a and e are the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the\nelliptic orbit, and f is the true anomaly.\nIn the non-uniformly rotating and pulsating coordinate system, the two massive primaries\nare always in fixed location on the x axis, and the dimensionless angular velocity of the\ntwo primaries is 1.\nConsider first the equations of motion in inertial coordinate system, using dimensional\nquantities and variables the equations of motion can be given as (Szebehely et al. 1967)\n\nd2X\nX \uf02d X1\nX \uf02d X2\n\uf03d \uf02dGm1\n\uf02d Gm2\n2\n3\ndt\nR1\nR23\n\n(1a)\n\nY \uf02d Y1\nY \uf02d Y2\nd 2Y\n\uf03d \uf02dGm1\n\uf02d Gm2\n2\n3\ndt\nR1\nR23\n\n(1b)\n\nZ \uf02d Z1\nZ \uf02d Z2\nd 2Z\n\uf03d \uf02dGm1\n\uf02d Gm2\n2\n3\ndt\nR1\nR23\n\n(1c)\n\nwhere t is the dimensional time, and X, Y and Z are the dimensional coordinates of the\nthird body in inertial coordinate system,\n\nRi 2 \uf03d \uf028 X \uf02d X i \uf029 \uf02b \uf028Y \uf02d Yi \uf029\n2\n\n2\n\ni \uf03d 1, 2 , and X i , Yi are the dimensional coordinates of the two massive primaries.\n\n5\n\n(1d)\n\n\fThe dimensional rotating coordinates ( x\uf025 , y\uf025 , z\uf025 ) and the inertial coordinates \uf028 X , Y , Z \uf029\nsatisfy\n\uf0e6 x\uf025 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 cos f\n\uf0e7 \uf025\uf0f7 \uf0e7\n\uf0e7 y \uf0f7 \uf03d \uf0e7 \uf02d sin f\n\uf0e7 z\uf025 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 0\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8\n\nsin f\ncos f\n0\n\n0 \uf0f6\uf0e6 X \uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n0 \uf0f7\uf0e7 Y \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n1 \uf0f7\uf0e7\n\uf0f8\uf0e8 Z \uf0f8\n\nThe relationship between the dimensionless coordinates\n\n(2)\n\n\uf028 x, y , z \uf029\n\nand the\n\ndimensional coordinates ( x\uf025 , y\uf025 , z\uf025 ) can be given as\n\n\uf0e6 x \uf0f6 \uf0e6 x\uf025 \uf0f6\n\uf0e6 x\uf025 \uf0f6\n2\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf025\uf0f7\n\uf0e7 \uf025 \uf0f7 a (1 \uf02d e )\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\ny\ny\n/\nL\ny\n/\n\uf05b\n\uf05d\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7 1 \uf02b e cos f\n\uf0e7 z \uf0f7 \uf0e7 z\uf025 \uf0f7\n\uf0e7 z\uf025 \uf0f7\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n\n(3)\n\nThe true anomaly as the independent variable may be introduced by the equation\nd\nd df\nd \uf026\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf0d7f\ndt df dt df\n\n(4)\n\nSubstitute equation (2), (3), (4) into the equation (1a), (1b) and (1c) and let\n\n\uf06d\uf03d\n\nm2\nm1 \uf02b m2\n\n1\uf02d \uf06d \uf03d\n\nm1\nm1 \uf02b m2\n\n(5a)\n\n(5b)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the dimensionless mass of the Earth and 1-\u03bc then the dimensionless mass of\nthe Sun.

If an NEO is inside the zero velocity\n9\n\n\fsurfaces surrounding the Earth, and satisfying the condition C>C1, then it would not\npenetrate the zero velocity surfaces to become a small satellite of the Earth.\nWe use this property to search the possible temporal captured NEOs and to estimate the\nvelocity requirement for changing an NEO orbit into the orbit around the Earth when a\nNEO enters the Earth influence region.\nWe added some codes including sequence control function to the software ORBFIT and\nexamined all the close approaching NEOs (considered the Earth approaching distance is\ncloser than 0.008AU and time is up to year 2060) from over six thousand NEOs*. The\nlocal Jacobian constants of the close approaching NEOs are listed in Table 1. From table\n1 we can conclude that there are no close approaching NEOs to seem naturally captured\nby the Earth temporarily. But the Jacobian constant of some NEOs close to C1, such as\n2008EA9 and 2009BD, others are quite different from it. But we cannot deny that we\nmay find some such kind of NEOs in the future.\n\n3. Orbital change of the close approaching NEO\nOrbital change of an NEO: Here we consider giving a velocity increment to change\nNEO orbit energy to have it captured by the Earth. In the close approaching phase, the\norbital dynamics is considered as Sun-Earth-NEO elliptical three-body system, so using\nthe local Jacobian integral, it can be written as\nv 2 \uf03d 2\uf057 \uf02d C \uf02b z 2\n\n(12)\n\nIf a velocity increment is applied in a short time, the velocity difference can be written as\n\nv12 \uf02d v02 \uf03d 2\uf044\uf057 \uf02d \uf044C \uf02b \uf044z\n\n*\n\nThe orbital data of these asteroids can refer to http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/neo_elem\n\n10\n\n(13)\n\n\fThe maneuver is assumed to be implemented in a short time, than \u0394\u03a9=0, \u0394z=0 can be\napproved, therefore\n\n\uf044v \uf03d v02 \uf02d \uf044C \uf02d v0\n\n(14)\n\nFor engineering application, this velocity increment is not only a criterion for local\ncapture, but also a useful value for NEOs sampling. For a large amount of NEO sample,\nfor example, choosing a small velocity increment NEO can cut the fuel cost of spacecraft\ngreatly. Table 1 shows that most of the close-approaching NEOs are in the high energy\norbit, see the column of C and \u0394V. It is very difficult to change these high energy orbit\nNEOs to have them captured by the Earth, but there are some NEOs which orbital energy\nis easy to be changed, like last two of the table.\n\nTable 1.

(12) that the Jacobian constant is actually not a constant in the\nelliptical system, but it is varying with true anomaly of the Earth orbit.

Capture methods\nIn order to capture a near Earth object, there are several alternatives. These alternatives\nwere broadly classified as \"impulsive\" if they acted nearly instantaneously, or \"slow\npush\" if they acted over an extended period of time (NASA 2006). The impulsive\n18\n\n\ftechniques generally included conventional explosive, kinetic impactor and nuclear\nexplosive. And the slow push techniques included Enhanced Yarkovsky effect, focused\nsolar, gravity tractor, mass driver, pulsed laser and space tug. Considering the required\nimpulsive velocity increment is not so small and the diameter of NEOs is relatively large,\nthere are two impulsive capture methods available, kinetic impactor and nuclear\nexplosion, but they are never tested or applied. Among them, the nuclear explosion\nmethod may not be proper one for the mentioned small NEO, because the nuclear\nexplosion can release a very large amount of energy, the result may be a fragmentation of\nthe target NEO. So the kinetic impactor is often considered as a better maneuver means\nespecially for the NEOs smaller than 50 meters in diameter.\n\nKinetic impact: A space probe or a specially designed projectile which will hit an NEO\nat a very high velocity, and therefore deliver an impulse that will change the orbit of the\nNEO. The relative velocity between the impactor and the NEO depends on the orbit of\nthe impactor, the limited payload capacity of the available launch systems, and the\napplication of new technology. For example, the relative velocity can reach 60km/s by\nutilizing solar sailing (McInnes 2004).\nFor the kinetic impactor, the transfer of momentum can be calculated by\n\n\uf044V \uf03d \uf062\n\nmi vi\nMa\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the impact efficiency constant, the value of the constant greatly depends on the\nstructure and the material properties of the NEO. If \u03b2=1, the collision is perfectly plastic,\nno ejecta are produced, and momentum is imparted directly. If an NEO is sufficiently soft\nand the impactor penetrates, then \u03b2<1 and the impact is less effective. If that \u03b2>1, ejecta\n\n19\n\n\fare released by the impact, and the impact is more effective. Some estimate that \u03b2 could\nhave a magnitude of 10 or more.\nThe effective momentum changes for kinetic impact are calculated to range from about\n5 \uf0b4107 to 2 \uf0b41010 kg-m/s (NASA 2006). Taking the NEO 2008EA9 as an example,\ncapturing it needs a velocity increment of -1.00km/s, if its density is 2 \uf0b4103 kg/m3 and\ndiameter is 10m, the momentum changes can be given as\n\n\uf044p \uf03d M \uf044v \uf03d \uf072V \uf044v \uf03d 8 \uf0b4 109 kg \uf0d7 m / s\n\n(16)\n\nSo the kinetic impact is a possible way for the capture of 2008EA9, and assuming the\nrelative velocity vi=60km/s and the impact constant \u03b2=5, we can calculate the mass of\nimpactor needed by Eq.15\n\nmi \uf03d\n\n\uf044p\n\uf03d 26.4 \uf0b4103 kg\nvi \uf062\n\n(17)\n\nThis is still a likely practical value.\n\nSampling from a close approaching NEO: Large amount sampling desires low fuel\ncost trajectory, however, the near Earth objects are not all in the desirable energy orbit.\nMining some NEOs needs more velocity increment while others need lower. But if it is\npossible, mining in close approaching moment can greatly shorten mission time that may\nsignificantly reduce risk. Here we assume that mining an NEO and depart from the NEO\nat its closest point of the Earth, and in this point the spacecraft changes its velocity so that\ninto a big elliptical Earth centred orbit whose perigee intersect the parking orbit (for\nexample 200km), and after reaches the perigee applying another velocity change to get\nparking orbit. The L1 closing velocity increment can be obtained by Eq. (14). And\n\n20\n\n\faccording to the orbital energy equation, in the apogee and perigee the velocity\nincrements can be conservatively estimated by\n\n\uf044va \uf03d\n\n\uf044v p \uf03d\n\n\uf06de \uf0e9\n\n2rp \uf0f9\n\uf0ea1 \uf02d\n\uf0fa\n(ra \uf02b rp ) \uf0fa\uf0fb\nra \uf0ea\uf0eb\n\n(18a)\n\n\uf06de \uf0e9\n\n(18b)\n\n\uf0f9\n2ra\n\uf02d 1\uf0fa\n\uf0ea\nrp \uf0eb\uf0ea (ra \uf02b rp ) \uf0fa\uf0fb\n\nWhere \u03bce is the gravitational constant of the Earth; ra is the apogee radius and rb is the\nperigee radius, respectively, of Earth centred orbit. The transfer mentioned above similar\nto a Hohmann transfer between a big and a small circular orbit.\n\u0394va=0.73km/s and \u0394vp=2.19km/s for NEO 2008EA9.\n\nOne can obtain\n\nCounting L1 closing velocity\n\nincrement, it totally needs velocity increment of 3.92km/s for returning from the NEO,\nand it would be much lower if the aerobraking is considered.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we examined Near Earth Objects' orbital dynamics using the\nframework of an accurate solar system model and the Sun-Earth-NEO three-body system\nto search for low-energy NEOs that may be temporarily captured by the Earth or might\nbe able to orbit the Earth after the exertion of a small velocity increment. The results\nshowed that none of the more six thousand NEOs were naturally captured, but we did\nfind some NEOs that would be captured by the Earth after exerting a small velocity\nchange (less than 1km/s) while close to the Earth. These NEOs are prime candidates for\nshort sampling missions conducted by spacecraft.\n\n21\n\n\fReferences\n1. Koon, W. S., Lo, M. W., Marsden, J. E., & Ross, S. D., 2000, Chaos, 10(2), 427\n2.
