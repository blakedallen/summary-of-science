INTRODUCTION\n\nThe present agreement between experimental data and the standard model (SM) suggests\n\u221a that the energy scale \u039b\nassociated with any new physics should be large compared with the electroweak scale v = ( 2GF )1/2 = 246 GeV. To\ninfer the existence of new particles as heavy as \u039b through their virtual effects, effective Lagrangian (EL) techniques\nhave been extensively used to study quantities which are forbidden or highly suppressed within the SM [1\u20133]. Among\nthese quantities, self-couplings of electroweak gauge bosons constitute a sensitive probe of nonstandard interactions\n[4]. Experimental bounds on possible anomalous W + W \u2212 Z(\u03b3) couplings have reached an accuracy of the few percent\nlevel in both hadronic and leptonic colliders [5,6], but the situation looks less promising for anomalous ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3,\nand Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings [7]1 . Unlike W + W \u2212 Z(\u03b3) couplings, trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings (TNGBC) vanish\nwhen the three bosons are real. Another interesting peculiarity of TNGBC is that they must be induced by loop\neffects in any renormalizable theory since they cannot possess a renormalizable structure. In the SM, TNGBC are\ngenerated at one-loop level by fermion triangles [8], being very suppressed even in the presence of a fourth fermion\nfamily [9]. There follows that it is convenient to carry out a model independent study of TNGBC using the EL\nmethod to parametrize any anomalous contribution. Within this approach, there are two well motivated schemes to\nparametrize virtual effects of physics beyond the Fermi scale via effective operators involving only SM fields, namely\nthe linear and the nonlinear realizations.\nIn the linear realization or decoupling scenario it is assumed that the light spectrum of particles, which fill out\nmultiplets of the electroweak SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge group, includes at least the physical Higgs boson of the SM.\nBecause of the decoupling theorem, virtual effects of heavy physics cannot affect low energy processes dramatically.\nNonetheless, any new effect, in spite of its smallness, may have significant effects on the couplings which are absent or\nhighly suppressed within the SM. Starting from the SM fields and assuming lepton and baryon number conservation,\nthere is no way to construct any odd dimension operator respecting the linearly realized SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y symmetry.\n\n1\n\nThroughout this work we consider the general case of off-shell bosons, unless stated otherwise, but they will be denoted by\nV rather than V \u2217 .\n\n1\n\n\fAs for dimension six, operators of this class were comprehensively studied in [10]. It was shown that there are 84\nindependent dimension six operators.\nIn the case of the nonlinear realization or nondecoupling scenario, the parametrization of new physics effects arises\nwhen it is assumed that the Higgs bosons are very heavy or do not exist at all. The scalar sector is comprised only\nby Goldstone bosons, which transform nonlinearly under the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y group. It is also possible to introduce\nlight scalar fields in this parametrization, but they cannot be recognized as Higgs bosons since such fields do not\ncouple to the remaining light particles as dictated by the Higgs mechanics [11]. Since the low energy theory is\nnonrenormalizable under Dyson prescription, heavy physics does not decouple from the low energy processes. We\nmay think of this scenario as the one in which the EL parametrizes unknown physics which would not obey the Higgs\nmechanism. In this case, the most important operators are the ones which induce the masses of the W and Z gauge\nbosons, prescribing also the general structure of the W + W \u2212 Z(\u03b3) couplings [12]. These operators have dimension two\nand four.\nAt the lowest order, anomalous W + W \u2212 Z(\u03b3) couplings are induced by dimension six operators in the decoupling\nscenario. In the nonlinear scheme, they receive contributions from dimension four operators. In contrast, at the lowest\norder, TNGBC are induced by dimension eight operators in the linear realization and by dimension six operators in\nthe nonlinear one. In the latter case there are also some dimension four operators which give rise to the ZZZ coupling,\nbut they are proportional to the scalar part of the Z boson (\u2202\u03bc Z \u03bc ). It can be shown that such operators may be\neliminated by means of a transformation which leaves invariant the S-matrix [13]. Consequently, any anomalous\ncontribution to TNGBC is expected to be more supppresed than those inducing nonstandard W + W \u2212 Z(\u03b3) couplings.\nIt must be stressed, however, that any potential effect must be carefully examined as it may constitute a clear evidence\nof new physics.\nThe structure of TNGBC has already been studied in the context of effective theories, initially at the level of\nvertex functions [14]. However, in this approach it was considered the case where two particles are real and just one\nis virtual. It is only very recently that the analysis of the off-sell vertices has been done under the U(1)em gauge\ninvariant framework, including the study of the respective EL. By invoking Bose symmetry, Lorentz covariance, and\nelectromagnetic gauge invariance, the most general structures inducing TNGBC with three off-shell neutral bosons\nwere constructed [15]. As was shown in [16], the U(1)em gauge invariant framework is equivalent to the nonlinearly\nrealized SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant case. Such an equivalence is explicit in the unitary gauge. The choice of using\neither framework is only a matter of convenience. In particular, the nonlinear scheme is convenient in working out\nloop calculations, as the presence of Goldstone bosons allows to quantize the theory with the aid of a renormalizable\nR\u03be gauge.\nIt is clear that a comprehensive study of TNGBC must include both the linear and the nonlinear schemes. To our\nknowledge the former has never been studied before. One of the aims of the present paper is to present a complete\nlist of the effective operators which induce TNGBC at the lowest order in both realizations of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y\ngauge symmetry. Not all the operators that can be constructed respecting the Lorentz and electroweak symmetries\nare independent since a certain class of general transformations allows to rule out some of them without affecting\nthe S-matrix elements [17]. In the course of our classification we have found operators with terms containing higher\nderivatives which resemble the covariant structure of the equations of motion; there are also operators with terms\nwhich are proportional to the scalar part of the Z boson (\u2202\u03bc Z \u03bc ). It has been shown in [13,18] that both types of\nstructures can be eliminated in favor of other operators already present in the effective Lagrangian. Such a procedure\nis only valid at first order in the unknown effective parameters of the theory as any effective Lagrangian is assumed\nto describe the effects of well-behaved new physics just in this approximation. Consequently, after performing the\nrequired transformation, the equations of motions can be used to eliminate any redundant structure, expressing the\nrespective operator in terms of other ones. This whole procedure does not affect the S-matrix elements. In order to\npresent all the independent operators, we will classify them according to the following criterion: those which can not\nbe reduced using the equations of motion will be referred to as irreducible, the remaining ones will be referred to as\nreducible.\nAfter classifying the operators, our paper will be concerned with the sensitivity of some precision experiments to\nnew physics effects arising from TNGBC. Although persuasive theoretical arguments indicate that trilinear gauge\nboson couplings are not expected to be larger than the one percent [19,20], the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well\nas the planned Next Linear Collider (NLC) are expected to constrain them at a level of 10\u22124 \u201310\u22126 [4,21]. As long as\nTNGBC are concerned, the size of their effects will be suppressed by powers of (v/\u039b)4 and (v/\u039b)2 in the linear and\nthe nonlinear scenarios, respectively. We will examine whether some high precision measurements may lead to any\nreasonable bound on these couplings. The anomalous W + W \u2212 \u03b3(Z) couplings have been constrained from a global\nanalysis of the LEP/SLC observables at the Z pole [2]. To draw any inference about the size of TNGBC we will\nconsider the muon g \u2212 2 value, the known limit on the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron, and the current\nlimit on the rare decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3.\nOur paper is organized as follows. All the lowest dimension operators that generate TNGBC in the linear scheme are\n2\n\n\fpresented in Sec. II, following the classification criterion already explained. Besides, the respective Lagrangians and\nvertex functions are shown explicitly. In Sec. III, a similar analysis within the nonlinear scenario is presented. Sec.\nIV is devoted to examine the possibility of obtaining constraints on the couplings out of high precision experiments.\nFinally, the paper is closed with some concluding remarks in Sec. V.\n\nII. THE DECOUPLING SCENARIO\n\nThis section focuses on the itemization of all the lowest dimension operators that generate at least one of the\ncouplings ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 or Z\u03b3\u03b3 within the linear realization of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y electroweak group. To construct a\nbasis of independent operators with a given dimension, we must consider some aspects concerning the independence\nof the S-matrix under a wide class of transformations which leave it invariant [17]. For instance, it was shown\nin [18] that some operators, which consist of a piece containing higher derivatives, can be eliminated in favor of\nothers by using a specific transformation, leaving unchanged the S-matrix elements at any order of perturbation\ntheory. Another situation arises when an operator is proportional to the scalar part of the Z boson. While the latter\nkind of structures give vanishing contributions when the Z boson is on mass shell or is virtual but couples to light\nfermions, the situation is not the same in the case of the top quark. In this respect, this kind of operators can also\nbe eliminated by performing a transformation which does not alter the S-matrix elements [13]. It must be noted\nthat both transformations are equivalent to applying the equations of motion. Beside these considerations, we have\nmade a systematic use of integration by parts to rule out any operator related to others through a surface term.\nConsequently, we will catalog the operators inducing TNGBC as reducible or irreducible.\nAny SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant involving only bosonic fields can be constructed out of the covariant structures B\u03bc\u03bd ,\ni\nW\u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u03c3 i W\u03bc\u03bd\n, \u03a6, and D\u03bc \u03a6, where the covariant derivative is defined as D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 igW\u03bc \u2212 ig \u2032 B\u03bc , and \u03a6 is\nthe Higgs doublet. Using these basic structures, we can built the following SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant and Lorentz\ncovariant structures of dimension two through five\nB\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6, \u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6, \u03a6\u2020 W\u03bc\u03bd \u03a6, B\u03bc\u03bd B \u03bb\u03c1 , Tr[W\u03bc\u03bd W\u03bb\u03c1 ], \u03a6\u2020 (D\u03bc D\u03bd + D\u03bd D\u03bc )\u03a6, \u03a6\u2020 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6.\n\n(1)\n\nNote that another set of SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant and Lorentz covariant structures can be generated by operating\nwith the ordinary derivative on these expressions. Any nonrenormalizable bosonic operator can be built by choosing\nthe appropriate combinations of these structures to form Lorentz scalars. The ordinary derivative can act on the last\nexpressions in several ways, but the contractions \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bc\u03bd and \u2202 \u03bc (\u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6), being proportional to the scalar part of the\nZ boson, are special because in both cases we can use the equations of motion to eliminate the resulting operator.\nLet us now discuss the general Lorentz structure of TNGBC. The lowest dimension operators which can be assembled\nout of the basic structures have dimension six [10]. It is easy to see that no dimension six operator induce TNGBC,\nwhich unavoidably leads to search for eight dimension operators. In principle, the combination which can give rise\nto TNGBC may involve the 4-vectors A\u03bc and Z\u03bc , together with the antisymmetric tensors F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc and\nZ\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc Z\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Z\u03bc . Owing to U(1)em gauge symmetry, the electromagnetic field can only appear as A\u03bc through\nthe respective covariant derivative, which operates on charged fields only. Therefore, the photon must appear in any\nterm through the tensor field F\u03bc\u03bd . Due to the antisymmetry of the F\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd tensors, it is not possible to generate\nTNGBC using only these structures: it would be necessary to have at our disposal three antisymmetric tensors. There\nfollows the absence of the \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 vertex in this gauge invariant scheme.\nTo construct the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3, and Z\u03b3\u03b3 vertices, we must use at least a Z boson in the Z\u03bc form, which is allowed\nbecause this field couples to neutral fields. The 4-vector Z\u03bc is contained in the covariant derivative, which in the\nbosonic sector operates only on the Higgs doublet. As a consequence, the Higgs mechanism plays a special role\nin this type of couplings. In particular, the Higgs presence increases the dimension at which the operators can be\ngenerated in comparison to the nonlinear case, where this field is absent. The Z boson may appear through the\ncombinations Z\u03bb\u03c1 Z\u03bc\u03bd , Z\u03bb Z\u03bc\u03bd , Z\u03bc Z\u03bd , and Z\u03bc . The building blocks necessary to construct these couplings are \u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6,\n\u03a6\u2020 (D\u03bc D\u03bd + D\u03bd D\u03bc )\u03a6, and \u03a6\u2020 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6, which, after spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), induce the structures Z\u03bc ,\nZ\u03bc Z\u03bd , and Z\u03bc\u03bd (F\u03bc\u03bd )Z\u03bb , respectively. The irreducible operators may contribute to a given physical process through the\nspecific structure of TNGBC, while the reducible ones may contribute to it via contact diagrams in which an internal\nline associated with either a Z boson or a photon has been amputated, for instance when the equations of motion\nare used to replace the term \u2202\u03bc B \u03bc\u03bd with the respective current. Therefore, the irreducible operators deserve a more\ncareful study than the reducible ones. We will present thus the Lagrangians and vertex functions in the irreducible\ncase, whereas in the reducible case we will list only the respective operators and the Lagrangian prescribing the\noff-shell electromagnetic properties of the Z boson. In the next section we will enumerate the operators of dimension\neight that generate TNGBC.\n\n3\n\n\fA. Irreducible operators\n\nWe begin by classifying those operators which cannot be eliminated using the equations of motion. We will categorize\nthem according to CP symmetry.\n1. CP -odd operators\n\nThe operators we are interested in have the form Oi \u2202 \u03c1 Oj , where Oi is any of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant\nexpressions shown in (1). Given these operators it is immediate to construct the new ones (\u2202 \u03c1 Oi )Oj , which also\nbelong to the irreducible group, but they are not independent at all since they are related to the original operators\nthrough a surface term. Bearing this in mind, we obtain the following four independent CP -odd operators of dimension\neight\nOW W 1 = i2\u2202 \u03bb (\u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6)Tr [W\u03bc\u03bd W\u03bb\u03bd ] + h.c.,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n+ h.c.,\n\n(3)\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bb\u03bd\n\n+ h.c.,\n\n(4)\n\nOW B1 = i(\u03a6 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6)\u2202 B\n\nOW B2 = i(\u03a6 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6)\u2202 B\n\u2020\n\n\u03bb\n\nOBB1 = i(\u03a6 D\u03bc \u03a6)B\u03bb\u03bd \u2202 B\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n+ h.c.\n\n(5)\n\nNotice that the operator OBB1 contains three SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant structures which can be contracted with\nthe ordinary derivative in three different ways, leading to the same number of operators. One of them, namely\ni\u2202 \u03bb (\u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6)B\u03bb\u03bd B \u03bc\u03bd , is irreducible, but can be expressed by means of integration by parts in terms of OBB1 and the\nreducible operator i(\u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6)(\u2202 \u03bb B\u03bb\u03bd )B \u03bc\u03bd , which will be considered later.\n2. CP -odd structure of the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3, and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings\n\nThe 4-vector Z\u03bc arises from the term (\u03a6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03a6) after SSB, whereas the antisymmetric field tensors F\u03bc\u03bd and Z\u03bc\u03bd\nappear through the relations\nB\u03bc\u03bd = cw F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 sw Z\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(6a)\n\n3\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n= sw F\u03bc\u03bd + cw Z\u03bc\u03bd + ig(W\u03bc\u2212 W\u03bd+ \u2212 W\u03bc+ W\u03bd\u2212 ),\n\n(6b)\n\nwhere sw (cw ) = sin\u03b8w (cos\u03b8w ), with \u03b8w the weak mixing angle. After the decomposition of these operators in terms\nof the mass eigenstate fields, we are left with several Lorentz structures corresponding to TNGBC, though not all\nof them are independent. Some of them are identical, which is manifest after a subtle manipulation of their Lorentz\nindices, whereas other ones are related through a surface term. Consequently, the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings can\nbe described by the following independent Lorentz structures\n\u2212odd\nZZZ\n\u03bb \u03bc\u03bd\nZZZ\nLCP\n+ fL2\nZ\u03bc\u03bd Z \u03bb\u03bd \u2202\u03bb Z \u03bc ,\nL\u2212ZZZ = fL1 Z\u03bb Z\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 Z\n\n(7)\n\nZZ\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\nZZ\u03b3\nZZ\u03b3\n\u2212odd\nLCP\nF\u03bb\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb Z\u03bc + fL2\nZ\u03bb Z\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb F \u03bc\u03bd + fL3\nZ\u03bb F\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb Z \u03bc\u03bd ,\nL\u2212ZZ\u03b3 = fL1 Z\n\n(8)\n\nZ\u03b3\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\nZ\u03b3\u03b3\n\u2212odd\nLCP\nF\u03bb\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb Z\u03bc + fL2\nZ\u03bb F\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb F \u03bc\u03bd ,\nL\u2212Z\u03b3\u03b3 = fL1 F\n\n(9)\n\nZZZ\nwhere L is a subscript standing for the linear scheme.

We have also introduced the definition \u01ebi = (mZ /\u039b)4 \u03b1i , where \u03b1i is the arbitrary coefficient\nassociated with each operator in the EL scheme. The vertex functions are presented in Appendix I.\n3. CP -even operators\n\nOperators of this kind can be obtained from the CP -odd ones by replacing each strength tensor with its respective\nf \u03bc\u03bd = (1/2)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 W\u03bb\u03c1 , and a similar expression for B\ne\u03bc\u03bd . There is a couple of independent CP -even\ndual, namely W\noperators associated with each one of the CP -odd operators OW W 1 , OW B2 , and OBB1 . Note that in these operators\nboth W tensors are contracted via only one of their indices, leading to two independent combinations of the dual\ntensor. On the other hand, in OW B1 the W and B tensors appear contracted by both indices. Since the two possible\ncombinations of dual tensors are equivalent, just one CP -even operator can be constructed from OW B1 . In this way,\nthere are seven independent CP -even operators\ni\nh\n\u03bb\n\u2020\nf \u03bc\u03bd W\u03bb\u03bd + h.c.,\n(13)\n=\ni2\u2202\n(\u03a6\nD\n\u03a6)Tr\nOW\nW\n\u03bc\ne W1\ni\nh\n\u03bb\n\u2020\n\u03bc\u03bd f\n(14)\nOW W\nf1 = i2\u2202 (\u03a6 D\u03bc \u03a6)Tr W W\u03bb\u03bd + h.c.,\n\u2020\n\u03bb e \u03bc\u03bd\nOW B1\ne = i(\u03a6 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6)\u2202 B + h.c.,\n\n(15)\n\n\u2020\n\u03bb \u03bc\u03bd\ne\nOBB1\ne = i(\u03a6 D\u03bc \u03a6)B\u03bb\u03bd \u2202 B + h.c.,\n\n(18)\n\n\u03bc \u03bb\u03bd\n\u2020f\nOW\ne B2 = i(\u03a6 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6)\u2202 B + h.c.,\n\u2020\n\n\u03bc\n\ne \u03bb\u03bd\n\nOW B2\ne = i(\u03a6 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb \u03a6)\u2202 B\n\u2020\n\n\u03bb\n\ne \u03bc\u03bd\n\nOB B1\ne = i(\u03a6 D\u03bc \u03a6)B\u03bb\u03bd \u2202 B\n\n+ h.c.,\n\n+ h.c.\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\n(19)\n\nWe can make the ordinary derivative operate on the remaining SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant terms out of which the previous operators are constructed.

All of these operators can be reduced to others by using the equations of motion. To define these structures,\nit will be necessary to include some operators of dimension ten, but as they can always be expressed in terms of other\noperators we will content ourselves with list them.

THE NONDECOUPLING SCENARIO\n\nWe will proceed now to consider the possibility that new physics effects do not decouple from low energy physics.\nIn this situation, the relevant SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant structures are the same as in the linear case, with the Higgs\ndoublet being replaced by the following unitary matrix\nU = exp[\n\n2i\u03c3 i \u03c6i\n],\nv\n\n(43)\n\nwhere the \u03c6i scalars would become Goldstone bosons. The covariant derivative in the nonlinear realization of the\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y group is defined as D\u03bc U = \u2202\u03bc U + igW\u03bc U \u2212 ig \u2032 U B\u03bc , where the Abelian field is now defined as\nB\u03bc\u0002 = (\u03c3 3 /2)B\u0003\u03bc . The\n\u0002 basic structures out\u0003 of which\u0002 TNGBC can\u0003 be constructed are the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariants\nTr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bc U , Tr U \u2020 (D\u03bc D\u03bd + D\u03bd D\u03bc )U , and Tr U \u2020 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb U , which in mass units have dimension one, two, and\nthree. Like their linear counterparts, these invariants are essential to construct any TNGBC because they induce the\nLorentz structures Z\u03bc , Z\u03bc Z\u03bd , and Z\u03bb Z\u03bc\u03bd (F\u03bc\u03bd ). Since these structures have a lower dimension than their analogous in\nthe linear case, in the nonlinear scenario not only it is possible to construct dimension six operators inducing TNGBC,\nbut it is also possible a larger number of independent operators. As we will show below, there exist some operators\nof dimension four which induce the ZZZ coupling, though not the ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 ones. Nevertheless, such operators\nare proportional to the scalar part of the Z boson and belong to the reducible group. We will use the same criterion\nused in the linear case to classify all of the independent operators. We will refrain from any technical detail already\nexplained in the linear case if it is not relevant for the present discussion.\n8\n\n\fA. Irreducible operators\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThese operators are proportional to the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y invariant structures Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bc U and Tr U \u2020 W\u03bc\u03bd D\u03bb U .\nWe will classify them according to CP symmetry.\n1.

As the structure\nTr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bc U has dimension one, we can construct three new independent operators of dimension six which have no\ndimension eight counterpart in the linear realization. They are given by\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bbDD \u0002 3 \u2020\nTr \u03c3 U D\u03bc U \u2737Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bd U \u2202 \u03bc Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bc U + h.c.,\n2\n\u039b\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bbDB1 \u0002 3 \u2020\n=\nTr \u03c3 U D\u03bc U \u2202\u03bb Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bd U \u2202 \u03bb B \u03bc\u03bd + h.c.,\n\u039b2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bbDB2 \u0002 3 \u2020\nTr \u03c3 U D\u03bc U \u2202\u03bd Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bb U \u2202 \u03bb B \u03bc\u03bd + h.c.\n=\n\u039b2\n\nLDD = i\nLDB1\nLDB2\n\n(48)\n(49)\n(50)\n\nNote that in the linear scheme the operator corresponding to LDD have dimension twelve, whereas those related to\nLDB1 and LDB2 are of dimension ten. These operators have the peculiarity that they induce TNGBC exclusively,\ni.e.\u0003\n\u0002\nthere are no interactions containing a charged W boson, which can be seen by noting that the structure Tr \u03c3 3 U \u2020 D\u03bc U\nis proportional to the Z\u03bc boson in the unitary gauge. While the first one of these operators induces only the ZZZ\ncoupling, the remaining ones generate both the ZZZ and ZZ\u03b3 couplings. There is no Z\u03b3\u03b3 coupling arising from\nthese kind of operators, which implies that the Lorentz structure of it is the same in both the linear and the nonlinear\nrealizations of the electroweak group, at least at this order.\n2. CP -odd structure of the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3, and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings.\n\nAfter decomposing the nonlinear CP -odd operators in terms of the physical fields, we have found that the ZZZ\ncoupling can be described by five independent Lorentz structures, and so is the ZZ\u03b3 vertex. On the other hand, the\nZ\u03b3\u03b3 coupling becomes changed, as compared to its counterpart in the linear case, in its coefficients but not in its\nLorentz structure.

CONSTRAINTS FROM PRECISION MEASUREMENTS\n\nOnce a complete treatment of the effective operators inducing TNGBC has been presented within both the linear\nand the nonlinear realizations of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge symmetry, our major concern lies in how to get bounds\non the respective coefficients of these operators from current phenomenology. In this respect, considerable work\nexists in the literature where bounds on anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings W + W \u2212 \u03b3 have been analyzed. To\nthis purpose, measurements on some observables have been extensively used, such as the magnetic and the electric\ndipole moments of elementary fermions, the Z \u2192 b\u0304b branching fraction, as well as the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W W and\nW \u2217 \u2192 W \u03b3 [4]. As for TNGBC, bounds on these couplings have been obtained through the processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3(Z)\nand q q\u0304 \u2192 Z\u03b3(Z), although such studies involve only those operators in which two gauge bosons are on-shell. To\nobtain bounds on our operators, we will follow a similar approach as that in previous works. We will also consider the\nrare decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3, which is affected at tree level by TNGBC through the ZZ\u03b3 vertex. Since its SM contribution\nis insignificant [9], this process might offer an invaluable mode to unravel any latent new physics effect.\nA. Decoupling scenario\n\nWe will start by examining the situation in the decoupling scheme of EL. Rather than performing any explicit\ncalculation, it is worth to begin with estimating on a general basis the expectations we should have as regards to\nthe size of TNGBC. It has been pointed out that persuasive theoretical arguments indicate that one loop generated\nanomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings are unlikely expected to be above the one percent level [22]. Indeed, the\nfact that TNGBC are induced at one loop level suggests that they are of order (g/4\u03c0)2 in a wide class of models. It has\nalso been conjectured that even in theories with underlying strong dynamics, trilinear gauge couplings are expected\nto have a sizeable enhancement. In the SM, the ZZ\u03b3(Z) couplings are severely constrained, even in the presence of\na fourth fermion family they are highly suppressed and thus out of the range of detectability [9,15]. Regarding the\nbounds arising from phenomenological grounds, we would like to begin by examining in a qualitative way whether\nthe current measurements on the magnetic and electric dipole moments of elementary fermions can give any useful\nbound on TNGBC.\nThe effective operators presented so far not only induce TNGBC but also anomalous W + W \u2212 \u03b3 couplings. An\nexhaustive analysis on phenomenological constraints would require to compute every contribution to the observable\nunder study, including also the ones coming from all of the lower dimension operators inducing vertices which also\naffect the process. For the sake of simplicity, a crude estimate can be obtained if just some operators are considered\nat a time. In the specific case of the magnetic moment of leptons, which receives contributions from CP -even\n12\n\n\foperators exclusively, a profuse work has been devoted to study comprehensively the contributions from the lowest\norder effective operators respecting the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge invariance, linearly and nonlinearly realized, which\ninduce nonstandard anomalous couplings. In this respect, there are one loop generated operators of dimension six\nwhich induce W + W \u2212 \u03b3 couplings, but not TNGBC. These operators contribute to the magnetic moment of leptons\nvia their insertion in the loop diagram depicted in Fig. 1 [23]. Secondly, some dimension six operators directly induce\nthe magnetic moment term at tree level, though they are generated at the one loop level. Finally, the redefinition of\nthe gauge fields, necessary to an adequate definition of the quadratic part of the theory, also affects the anomalous\nmagnetic moment value. To obtain bounds on the coefficients of the CP conserving operators, the full contribution to\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon was computed [24]. In this respect, the strategy which has been found to\nbe the most suitable for estimating the size of loops involving an effective vertex is that of dimensional regularization,\ntogether with the minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization scheme. According to it and retaining only the leading\nlogarithmic dependence on the new physics scale \u039b, it was found that the contribution from dimension six operators\ninducing the W + W \u2212 \u03b3 vertex is given by\n\u03b4a\u03bc = \u03b70\n\n\u0010 m \u00112\n\u03bc\n\n\u039b\n\nO(log \u039b2 /m2W ) \u03b1L ,\n\n(84)\n\nwhere \u03b70 is a factor dependent on the particular graph, and \u03b1L is directly related to the operator coefficients.\nNumerically, one obtains from this equation |\u03b4a\u03bc | /10\u22129 = \u03b1L (1 + log \u039b) /\u039b2 . If it is taken the accepted lowest value\nof 1 TeV for the new physics scale \u039b, we are left with the unpromising result that the operator coefficient should be\nof order O(1) to have any chance of being detected. But this result is far beyond the estimate of \u03b1L being of order\n(g/4\u03c0)2 . Indeed, only the direct contribution is expected to give a measurable contribution to the magnetic moment\nof the muon. In view of this result, it is natural to think that we should not expect a better situation for TNGBC\nsince they are generated by higher order operators. We note that dimension eight operators are suppressed by the\nfactor (v/\u039b)2 , with v = 246 GeV the vacuum expectation value, with respect to dimension six operators. A rough\nestimate is obtained if we multiply (84) with the suppression factor and evaluate again at \u039b = 1 TeV. We obtain the\ndiscouraging result that \u03b1L should be of order O(100), which is very unlikely to occur, to allow any TNGBC to be\nexperimentally detected. By way of illustration, we have explicitly computed the contribution to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment which is obtained by introducing in the one loop diagram of Fig. 1 the effective ZZ\u03b3 vertex whose\nFeynman rule is given by equations (24a) and (103b). After isolating the divergent part, the application of the MS\nscheme gives\n!\n\u0012\n\u00132\ntw (4s2w \u2212 1)g \u0010 mz \u00112 \u0010 m\u03bc \u00112\n\u039b\n3\nL1\nlog\ne\n\u01ebL1 ,\n(85)\n\u03b4a\u03bc =\n+\n256\u03c0 2\n\u039b\n\u039b\nmZ\n4\n\nZZ\u03b3\nwhere e\n\u01ebL1 is the factor multiplying s2w /(gm2Z ) in the coefficient gL1\nwhich is defined in (24a). In fact, if this equation\nis numerically evaluated we find that the actual bound is looser than the rough estimate. We thus see that it seems\nthere is few hopes that a reasonable bound on CP -even TNGBC could be obtained from precision measurements on\nthe magnetic moment of the muon. Although we have examined the situation of only one vertex, the same result\nis expected for the remaining ones. In fact, as shown in the appendices, the Lorentz structure which parametrizes\nTNGBC does not differ essentially for each case. The best result would be obtained if all contributions add up\ncoherently, though there is no evident reason to expect it.\nA similar analysis can be done for the CP -odd operators which contribute to the electric dipole moment of fermions.\nIn this case a strong bound, from precision measurements on the electric dipole moment of neutron, exists on dimension\nsix operators inducing anomalous W + W \u2212 \u03b3 couplings [25]. The respective operator coefficients are constrained to lie\nbelow the 10\u22123 level. Since our CP -odd operators, which also induce anomalous W + W \u2212 \u03b3 couplings, are of dimension\neight in the decoupling scenario we could not expect to get a better bound for their coefficients. Once more, a rough\nestimate would be obtained by dividing the bound on dimension six operators by the suppression factor (v/\u039b)2 .\nNow let us focus on the rare Z boson decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3, which has been studied within both the SM realm and the\nEL approach [3,9]. It was shown that the SM contribution turns out to be negligible small, with a branching ratio of\norder 10\u221210 [9]. In the EL approach, this process arises at tree level, as depicted in Fig. 2. In addition it has also the\nadvantage of receiving contributions from TNGBC only through the ZZ\u03b3 vertex, as depicted in Fig. 2 a. Although\nthere are also lower dimension effective operators contributing to Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 through the Feynman diagrams of Fig. 2 b\nand 2 c [3], we will not include those contributions in here since they are not associated with TNGBC. Furthermore,\nwe are only interested on estimating the best possible bound on TNGBC.\nThe measurement of energetic single-photons at LEP arising from the decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 has been used to put a\ndirect limit on the magnetic moment of the \u03c4 neutrino [26]. For the purpose of the present analysis, the search for\nthe energetic single-photons events on the data collected by the L3 collaboration may be translated into bounds on\n\n13\n\n\fTNGBC. In order to reduce backgrounds, the L3 collaboration required the photon energy to be greater than one\nhalf the e+ e\u2212 beam energy. It was obtained a limit on the branching ratio for Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 of one part in a million\nwhen the photon energy is above 30 GeV [26]. To calculate the decay width, we will follow closely the notation\nof [9]. Expressing the invariant amplitude M in terms of the variables x = 2k1 .p1 /m2Z and y = 2k1 .p2 /m2Z , the\nZ(k2 ) \u2192 A(k1 )\u03bd(p1 )\u03bd(p2 ) decay width is given by\nmZ\n\u0393(Z \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bd\u03b3) =\n256\u03c0 3\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndx\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212x\n\ndy|M|2 .\n\n(86)\n\n0\n\nWe have not imposed any energy cutoff since we want to estimate the TNGBC bounds in a conservative way. From\nthe Feynman rules for the ZZ\u03b3 vertex in Appendix I is obtained\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0001\n1\u0010 2\n|M|2 =\n(87)\ne2 ,\nx + y 2 (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y) \u2212 4x y \u03b12 + \u03b1\n32\n\u03b1 \u2261 \u03b1L = \u03b1L1 + \u03b1L2 \u2212 \u03b1L3 ,\n\n(88a)\n\n\u03b1\ne\u2261\u03b1\neL = \u03b1\neL1 \u2212 \u03b1\neL2 \u2212 \u03b1\neL3 + \u03b1\neL4 + \u03b1\neL5 .\n\n(88b)\n\nAs natural, there is no interference between CP violating and CP conserving couplings. The coefficients \u03b1Li (e\n\u03b1Li ),\nwhich in turn are related to the CP -odd (CP -even) operator coefficients, can be extracted from (11) and (24), being\ngiven by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng m2Z\nZZ\u03b3\n\u03b1Li =\nfLi\n,\n(89a)\ncw\n\u03b1\neLi =\n\n\u0012\n\ng m2Z\ncw\n\n\u0013\n\nZZ\u03b3\ngLi\n.\n\n(89b)\n\nAfter performing the integration in equation (86) we have\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne2L .\nBR(Z \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bd\u03b3) = 2.912 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03b12L + \u03b1\n\n(90)\n\ntaking the value \u039b = 1 TeV and considering the L3 bound on the respective branching fraction, we obtain again the\nresult that the size of the ZZ\u03b3 coupling should be beyond any reasonable expectation to become perceptible through\nthe process Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3. Stated in other words, we may not expect moderate bounds from this process. The reason\nof such a discouraging result is the natural suppression of dimension eight operators. Our viewpoint would be more\npessimistic if we consider that in this calculation only those contributions arising from effective operators inducing\nthe ZZ\u03b3 coupling have been included. However, there is no compelling reason to disregard any other new physics\ncontributions, such as the ones coming from the Feynman diagrams shown in the figures 2a and 2b [3]. In view of\nour results, it is conceivable to state that any TNGBC associated with underlying physics respecting linearly the\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y symmetry would not be measurable through the processes investigated in this work. However, we\ncannot discard the case in which certain TNGBC is given by a sum of loops whose contributions add up coherently\nto give a large value.\nB. Nondecoupling scenario\n\nWe will turn to analyze the situation in the nonlinear scenario, where TNGBC are generated by dimension six\noperators. Therefore, we might expect a better situation than that in the decoupling scenario. We will see that the\ndiscussion for the linear scenario can be easily translated to comprise the nonlinear case. To begin with, we can see\nfrom the Feynman rules in appendix II that in the nonlinear scenario the CP -even ZZ\u03b3 vertex is parametrized by one\nextra Lorentz structure in addition to those parametrizing this vertex in the decoupling case. The result given in (85)\nfor the linear scenario can be directly used if we consider the substitution rule applicable to the operator coefficients,\nZZ\u03b3\n2 ZZ\u03b3\nthat is gN\nLi = (\u039b/mZ ) gLi . We then have that the leading term obtained by including in the loop graph of Fig. 1\nZZ\u03b3\nthe ZZ\u03b3 vertex associated with gN\nL1 is\n14\n\n\fL1\n\u03b4aN\n\u03bc\n\ntw (4s2w \u2212 1)g \u0010 m\u03bc \u00112\n=\n256\u03c0 2\nv\n\nlog\n\n\u0012\n\nv\nmZ\n\n\u00132\n\n3\n+\n4\n\n!\n\ne\n\u01ebN L1 ,\n\n(91)\n\nL1\nwhere we have employed the conservative value \u039b \u2192 v. Numerically one obtains \u03b4aN\n= \u22120.767 \u00d7 10\u22129e\n\u01ebN L1 . On\n\u03bc\nthe other hand, the data collected through the BNL E281 experiment together with the SM predictions put a bound\non any new physics contribution to a\u03bc of \u22127.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 < \u03b4a\u03bc < 22.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 at 95 %CL [27]. As a consequence,\nL\nprobing \u03b4aN\nat the \u00b110\u22129 level provides a sensitivity to e\n\u01ebN L of about O(1) at most, which translates into a loose\n\u03bc\nbound for the operator coefficients \u03bbi . This situation is not better than the result obtained in [24] for the dimension\nfour operators inducing W + W \u2212 \u03b3 couplings within the nonlinear scheme. Moreover, as there are other sources of new\nphysics which can affect the anomalous magnetic moment, it is hard to think that any TNGBC could be competitive\nin this process, even in the nonlinear scenario.\nRegarding the rare decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3, after the inclusion of all the contributions arising from the ZZ\u03b3 vertex we have\nthat (87) remains valid, though (88a) and (88b) now read\n\n\u03b1 \u2261 \u03b1N L = \u03b1N L1 + \u03b1N L2 \u2212 \u03b1N L3 + 2 \u03b1N L4 + \u03b1N L5 ,\n\n(92a)\n\n\u03b1\ne\u2261\u03b1\neN L = \u03b1\neN L1 \u2212 \u03b1\neN L2 \u2212 \u03b1\neN L3 + \u03b1\neN L4 + \u03b1\neN L5 + 2 \u03b1\neN L6 .\n\n(92b)\n\n|hZ\n30 | < 0.38\n\n(93)\n\nThe new coefficients \u03b1N Li and \u03b1\neN Li are obtained, with the adequate subscript substitutions, via the relations (89a)\nZZ\u03b3\nand (89b), which also hold for the nonlinear scenario. The coefficients fN\nLi have been given in previous sections. We\nwill only concentrate in the CP -conserving term, which has been widely studied in the literature. Equation (90) and\nthe L3 limit for the respective branching ratio give the bound |e\n\u03b1N L | < 1.8\u00d710\u22121 if \u03b1N L = 0. This is a more promising\nresult than that previously found in the linear scenario. In fact, there exist a direct relation between the bound just\nobtained within the nonlinear scenario and the ones presented elsewhere under the parametrization derived in [14].\nIt will be shown below that \u03b1N L = 2g 2 hZ\neN L = 2g 2 hZ\n10 /(cw sw ) and \u03b1\n30 /(cw sw ) correspond to the low energy limit of\nZ\nthe form factors hi used extensively to study the ZZ\u03b3 vertex in the case in which one Z boson and the photon are\non-shell [28]. Our bound translates thus into\n\nZ\nZ\nif hZ\n10 = 0, which agrees with previous bounds [27]. Of course, the same result applies to h10 when h30 = 0. In\nthis analysis, we have considered that the SM contribution to the rare decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 is negligible, what is a\ngood approximation since it was found that the branching ratio is of order 10\u221210 [9]. We have also neglected the\ncontributions coming from the operators which give rise to the effective vertices shown in Fig. 2 b and 2 c. This is the\nmost optimum scenario indeed. It is likely that any TNGBC may be screened by any other sources of new physics\narising from lower dimension operators. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis must be done to disentangle any\nnew physics contributing to the processes e+ e\u2212 (qq) \u2192 ZZ\u03b3 [28].\n\nC. Connection with results derived within the U(1)em formalism\n\nIn the last subsections, the EL parametrization we elaborated earlier was used to examine the impact of TNGBC\non some loop induced processes. It was also examined whether it is possible to obtain any reasonable bound from\nthe current limit on the branching ratio of the rare decay Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3. These vertices were studied for the first\ntime long ago, although only one particle was allowed to be off-shell [14]. Following this approach, it has been\ncustomary to parametrize any new physics effects inducing TNGBC by certain structures derived out of U(1)em gauge\ninvariance, Lorentz covariance, as well as Bose symmetry, what corresponds to the so called U(1)em framework [21].\nThe coefficients of such Lorentz structures are taken to be form factors which actually comprise all our ignorance on\nthe underlying dynamics inducing TNGBC. In general, these form factors depend on the squared momenta of the\nparticipating particles. Furthermore, as this dependence is unknown since the form factors are determined by the\nup to now unknown physics, it is necessary to make some assumptions to describe their behavior. This scheme has\nprobed to be useful to constrain the low energy values of the form factors through Z\u03b3 production in e+ e\u2212 and qq\ncollisions at LEP, the Tevatron, and the future LHC [21].\nThe latter formalism is to be contrasted with the EL method followed in this work, which in turn is well suited for\nstudying new physics effects in a model independent way and no form factors nor extra assumptions on the unknown\nphysics are required, but all our ignorance of the new physics lies in dimensionless (or dimensionful) coefficients\nassociated with each effective operator, which in turn only depend on the new physics energy scale. Another peculiarity\n15\n\n\fof the EL formalism is that we are allowed to know what operators the new physics comes from, in contrast to the\nform factor scheme where we only know that the form factors themselves are generated at a given order in the U(1)em\neffective Lagrangian. To establish a direct connection between these two different formalisms is not an immediate nor\nan easy task. In a previous work [15] both approaches, within the U(1)em gauge invariant scheme, were considered\nand their relation was established. It was shown how the form factors are related to the coefficients associated with\nthe effective operators arising from the U(1)em framework. At this point, it is natural to ask whether there is a direct\nconnection between our own results, when it is considered the case of only one off-shell particle, and those derived\nfrom the form factor parametrization. We will show that in the case where the form factors are given their low energy\nvalues hZ\ni0 , there is a simple connection indeed.\nTo show the relation between our results and previous ones, we will consider only the ZZ\u03b3 coupling, in the specific\ncase where both the initial Z boson and the photon are on-shell since it is the only coupling involved in the rare process\nZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3. The most general structure for the ZZ\u03b3 vertex respecting Lorentz covariance, U(1)em gauge invariance\nand Bose symmetry is given by\n\u0001\u0012\nie k22 \u2212 m2Z\nhZ\n\u03b11 \u03b1\u03b12\nZZ\u03b3\n\u2212 k \u03b12 g \u03b1\u03b11 ) + 22 k2\u03b11 (k2 * k g \u03b12 \u03b1 \u2212 k \u03b12 k2\u03b1 ) +\nhZ\n\u0393\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b1 (k1 , k2 , k) =\n(94)\n1 (k g\n2\nmZ\nmZ\n\u0013\nhZ\n\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b1\u03bc \u03bc\nhZ\nk + 42 k2\u03b11 \u01eb\u03b12 \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd k1\u03bc k2\u03bd\n3\u01eb\nmZ\nwhere all the momenta are taken as incoming. Any term proportional to k \u03b1 and k1\u03b11 has been omitted, the same is true\nfor those proportional to k2\u03b12 because it is also assumed that the virtual Z boson couples to light fermions, as actually\nhappens in the decay Z \u2192 ll\u03b3. In this parametrization, the CP -conserving terms hZ\n1,2 as well as the CP -violating\nZ\nones h3,4 are taken as form factors which depend on the dynamics of the underlying new physics, in general they\nare unknown functions of the squared momenta of the neutral bosons, namely k 2 , k12 , and k22 . Within the U(1)em\nformalism, as far as the form factors hZ\n1,3 are concerned, they receive contributions from dimension six operators,\nwhereas the ones hZ\ncan\nbe\ninduced\nby\ndimension eight or higher operators. Based on unitarity requirement, some\n2,4\nZ\n2 n\nZ\nauthors have extensively used the approximation hZ\ni = hi0 /(1 + s/\u039b ) , with n an integer, hi0 the form factor low\nenergy value, and s the squared momentum of the virtual Z boson [28]. If the energy scale \u039b associated with the new\nphysics inducing TNGBC is larger than the energy scale involved in the process, i.e. the squared momentum of the\nvirtual particle, it is a good approximation to use the low energy values of the form factors. After the replacement\nZ\nhZ\ni \u2192 hi0 is done in (94), we are left with the expression for the ZZ\u03b3 vertex which must coincide with the one\nobtained from our results in the nonlinear scenario.\nConsidering the assumptions just described, we can obtain from the appendices the expression for the ZZ\u03b3 vertex\narising from the lower dimension operators within either the linear scenario or the nonlinear one.

At first sight it seems there\nZ\nis no direct coincidence of the terms which multiply f2 and g2 with those multiplying hZ\n1 and h3 in (94). However,\nafter a judicious manipulation and with the aid of Shouten's identity, it can be shown that this is the case indeed.\nWe thus obtain a simple expression for the ZZ\u03b3 vertex\ni\n\u0001 h ZZ\u03b3\nZZ\u03b3\n\u03bc\n2\n2\n,\n(97)\ng\n)\n+\nf\n\u01eb\nk\ng\n\u2212\nk\ng\n(k\n\u0393ZZ\u03b3\n(k\n,\nk\n,\nk)\n=\nk\n\u2212\nm\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\n2\n2\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b1\n2\nZ\n\nwhich do show an obvious connection with (94). Instead of giving explicit expressions for f ZZ\u03b3 and g ZZ\u03b3 , we will\nZ\ne appearing in (88a)-(88b) for the linear scenario\nestablish the connection of hZ\n10 and h30 with the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b1\nand (92a)-(92b) for the nonlinear case. We thus have\nhZ\n10 =\n\ncw sw \u03b1L\n,\n2g 2\n16\n\n(98a)\n\n\fhZ\n30 =\n\ncw sw \u03b1\neL\n,\n2\n2g\n\n(98b)\n\nthe same relation holds for these coefficients in the nonlinear scenario. Explicit expressions from f ZZ\u03b3 and g ZZ\u03b3 can\nbe easily extracted from (89a) and (89b).\nFinally, a few comments are in order. Although the ZZ\u03b3 has the same Lorentz structure in both realizations of the\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge symmetry, the main difference is that the operators inducing these structures are of dimension\nsix in the nonlinear scenario, whereas in the linear case they are induced by dimension eight operators. As a result,\nZ\nthough the bounds found for the coefficients hZ\n10 and h30 apply in both scenarios, if they were translated into the\noperator coefficients \u03b1i and \u03bbi , looser bounds would be obtained in the linear scenario. Regarding the remaining\nTGBC, a similar analysis following the lines sketched above was done for the ZZZ and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings. It was\nfound that our results agree with those previously presented. Another interesting point to be noted is that, since the\noperators which induce the most general TNGBC vertices also induce those couplings with only one off-shell particle,\nany bound which has been put on the latter will be immediately applicable to the former.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have presented an analysis of trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings, ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3, under the\ncontext of the effective Lagrangian approach, both in the linear and the nonlinear realizations of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y\ngauge symmetry. Particular emphasis has been given to the linear scenario since current literature lacks of an analysis\nin this line. The most general case with three off-shell bosons is considered. In the linear scenario these couplings\nreceive contributions from dimension eight operators, whereas in the nonlinear scenario they are induced by dimension\nsix operators. For completeness, we have included the Lorentz structure which parametrizes these vertices, ready to\nbe used in any future calculation. Based on general considerations and actual calculations, we conclude that, if the\nuntil now unknown physics underlying the SM is of a decoupling nature, it is not expected that TNGBC could have\na considerable impact either through their virtual effects or via direct production. In contrast, if new physics effects\narise from a strong coupling regime at higher energies which is responsible for the breaking of the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y\nsymmetry (endowing the gauge bosons with mass), the possibility of measuring their effects still remains. The EL\napproach indicates that, owing to the suppression of the operators inducing TNGBC, it is difficult that the effects\narising from them may compete with those coming from other sources of new physics induced by lower dimension\noperators. However, it may happen that some fortuitous fact, such as some resonant effect, could give rise to large\nTNGBC in a particular model. In this context, it would be useful a study in a model dependent way to have more\nevidences which could lead us to a deeper understanding of TNGBC.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFinancial support from CONACYT and SNI (M\u00e9xico) is acknowledged.\nAPPENDIX I: TNGBC VERTEX FUNCTIONS IN THE LINEAR SCENARIO\n\nIn this appendix the vertex functions for the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3, and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings within the linear scenario are presented.
