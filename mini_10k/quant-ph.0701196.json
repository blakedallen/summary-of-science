Obviously this ability is related to the available physical operations on the actual state\nencoding. For quantum protocols whose state encoding is spanned by a two dimensional Hilbert space (qubits) one\nhas to be able to completely describe the actual physical operations acting directly on the physical system codifying\nstate space. Thus any physical operation (including measurements) is defined through completely positive maps. For\ncontinuous variable encoding as given by Gaussian states[33] physical operations given by positive maps can or cannot\nkeep the Gaussian character of the system state. Those operations that map every Gaussian input state into a Gaussian\noutput state are called Gaussian operations [1]. For unitary operations acting on a single system Gaussian state, for\nexample, the positive map is completely described by a local Sp(2, R) symplectic (canonical) transformation over the\nsystem's covariance matrix. Conversely, as a consequence of the Stone-von Neumann theorem, to every symplectic\ntransformation over the covariance matrix there exists a unique unitary operation acting on the corresponding state\nspace. Those operations correspond to the transformations induced by linear (active and passive) optical devices\n(beam-splitters, phase-shifters, and squeezers). It is thus not surprising that continuous variable quantum information\nprotocols have been implemented with a Gaussian state encoding and Gaussian operations [2, 3].\nThe whole set of unitary operations does not describe the most general transformation on quantum system states.\nA general evolution map of a quantum system including coupling to ancillas (or reservoir) and measurement is given\nby quantum operations [4]. In this formalism the map\n\u03c1\u2192\n\n\u03b5(\u03c1)\n,\nT r[\u03b5(\u03c1)]\n\n(1)\n\nconnects the initial (input) to the final (output) state. The quantum operation \u03b5 is a linear, trace decreasing map that\nP\npreserves positivity. A quantum operation \u03b5 satisfying complete positivity is written as \u03b5(\u03c1) = j Aj \u03c1A\u2020j , where Aj\nP \u2020\nis a set of system operators, which must satisfy j Aj Aj \u2264 I. Generally speaking, \"interactions\" with an ancilla (or\nP\nP\nreservoir) satisfy the trace-preserving condition j A\u2020j Aj = I, while quantum measurements satisfy j A\u2020j Aj < 1.\nThose operations which are trace preserving and irreversible are sometimes named as quantum channels. Gaussian\nquantum channels [5] have the additional feature to keep the Gaussian nature of the system(s) quantum state.\nSeveral authors have described Gaussian quantum channels and operations throughly [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Regardless\nthe specific interest in each one of those references, one common interesting feature observed is that the Schur\ncomplement [11] of square matrices representing Gaussian states covariances embodies a manifestation of a physical\noperation when considering partial projections and trace operations onto Gaussian states [7, 8]. However the process\n\n\u2217\n\nmarcos@ifi.unicamp.br\n\n\f2\nthat delivers the Schur complement of the covariance matrix itself for an input two-mode bipartite Gaussian state has\nnot been discussed yet. As we show in this paper, this is only possible when non-positive operations are allowed. The\npurpose of the present work is to derive this process for an arbitrary input two-mode bipartite Gaussian state and\ngeneralize it for the case of a n partite (n-mode) Gaussian state. Particularly we show that the Schur complement\nof one of the local covariance matrices of a bipartite Gaussian state appears as the covariance matrix describing a\nGaussian operator, which embodies a parity measurement over the other mode of the input state.\nWe begin by reviewing in Sec. 2 some properties of bipartite Gaussian states [12] and we describe the decomposition\nof positivity for a covariance matrix through the Schur complement [11] structure. In Sec. 3 we discuss examples of\nGaussian quantum operations, consisting of the vacuum state projection on one mode of a two-mode bipartite input\nstate, and the partial trace operation. In Sec. 4 we develop our central result, namely the covariance matrix that\nrepresents the Schur complement of one of the input subsystem covariance matrix. In Sec. 5 we describe the parity\nmeasurement process and the physical properties behind the mathematical quantity as given in Sec. 4. In Sec. 6\nwe outline how such a Schur complement of a local covariance matrix can be employed for entanglement and global\npurity quantification. In Sec. 7 we provide a generalization of this local parity measurement for a Gaussian state with\nn-modes in terms of an output covariance matrix. Finally Sec. 8 concludes the paper.\nTWO-MODE BIPARTITE GAUSSIAN STATES\n\nAny two-mode bipartite quantum state, \u03c112 , is Gaussian if we can write it as[34]\nZ\n\u2020\n1 \u2020\n\u03c112 = dz ez Ea e\u2212 2 z Vz .\n\n(2)\n\n\u2020\n1 \u2020\nAlternatively, if its symmetric characteristic function is given by \u03c7(z) = T r[D(z)\u03c1] = e\u2212 2 z Vz , where D(z) = e\u2212z Ea\nis a displacement operator with z\u2020 = (z1\u2217 , z1 , z2\u2217 , z1 ), a\u2020 = (a\u20201 , a1 , a\u20202 , a1 ), being a1 (a\u20201 ) and a2 (a\u20202 ) the annihilation\n(creation) operators for modes 1 and 2, respectively. Remark that here, as in many integrals through this paper the\nfollowing notation is employed: dz = dz1 dz2 , where dzi = d2 zi = dIm(zi )dRe(zi ) for i = 1, 2. Also,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 0\n1 0\nE=\n, Z=\n,\n(3)\n0 Z\n0 \u22121\n\nand V is the Hermitian 4 \u00d7 4 covariance matrix describing all the second order moments Vij = (\u22121)i+j h{vi , vj\u2020 }i/2,\nwhere (v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 ) = (a1 , a\u20201 , a2 , a\u20202 ), given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nn1 + 21\nm1\nms\nmc\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8ec m\u22171 n1 + 1\nV1 C\nm\u2217c\nm\u2217s \uf8f7\n2\n\uf8f7,\n(4)\n=\uf8ec\nV=\n\u2020\n1\n\u2217\n\uf8ed\nms\nmc n 2 + 2\nm2 \uf8f8\nC V2\nm\u2217c\nms\nm\u22172 n2 + 21\nwhere V1 and V2 are 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrices containing only local elements while C is the correlation between the\ntwo parties. Furthermore any covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (V \u2265 0) and for the operator (2) to\nrepresent a physical state the inequality\n1\nV + E \u2265 0,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nmust hold, which is nothing but the fundamental uncertainty principle.\nThose general positivity criteria can all be decomposed into properties of the block matrices V1 , V2 and C. A\nconvenient decomposition procedure is given by the Schur complement for non-singular block matrices[35]. In this\nway for the covariance matrix (4), V \u2265 0 if and only if\nV2 \u2265 0\n\n(6)\n\n\u2020\nS(V2 ) = V1 \u2212 CV\u22121\n2 C \u2265 0.\n\n(7)\n\nand the Schur complement of V2 , given by\n\n\f3\nSimilar properties have to be satisfied for the generalized uncertainty principle [9]:\n1\nV2 + Z \u2265 0,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n1\n1\nV1 + Z \u2212 C V2 + Z\nC\u2020 \u2265 0.\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nThe emergence of the Schur complement structure and its importance can be fully appreciated through the well known\ndeterminant decomposition property. Given V as described above,\ndet V = det V1 det(V2 \u2212 C\u2020 V\u22121\n1 C)\n\n\u2020\n= det V2 det(V1 \u2212 CV\u22121\n2 C ).\n\n(10)\n\nThus, it is immediate that any operation that yields V1 and S(V1 ) (or V2 and S(V2 ) by symmetry) can be employed,\nin priciple, to quantify some physical properties of the global covariance matrix V. This is the case for entanglement\nand global purity of a bipartite system, as discussed in details in Ref. [13], whose central results are commented latter.\nGAUSSIAN OPERATIONS\n\nLet us remark on two examples of Gaussian operations, which were previously considered in details in Ref. [1, 7, 8]\nto show that Schur complements of block matrices representing Gaussian states covariances embodies a manifestation\nof a physical operation when considering partial projections onto Gaussian states.\nThe first example considered is a vacuum state projection over the mode 2 of a two-mode Gaussian state \u03c112 :\n(0)\n\n\u03c31 = T r2 {|0i2 h0|\u03c112 }.\n\n(11)\n\nWriting the Gaussian state form of the one mode vacuum state according to equation (2) in (11), we have\n\u03c31 = T r2 {dz2 e\u2212 4 z2 z2 e\u2212z2 Za2 \u03c112 }.\n(0)\n\n1\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nNow replacing the Gaussian form for \u03c112 (2) and evaluating the trace, we have that\nZ\nZ\n(0)\n\u2020\n1 \u2020\n(0)\ndz1 ez1 Za1 dz2 e\u2212 2 z V z\n\u03c31 =\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u22121\n1 \u2020\n1\n\u2020\n1\nC\u2020 z1\nz\nZa\n1 \u2212 2 z1 V1 \u2212C(V2 + 2 I)\n1\nq\ne\n=\n,\n\u0001 dz1 e\ndet V2 + 12 I\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwith dz1 = d2 z1 = dIm(z1 )dRe(z1 ). We notice that the resulting state has also a Gaussian form with covariance\nmatrix given by (14)\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n1\n(0)\nC\u2020 .\n\u03931 = V1 \u2212 C V2 + I\n2\n\n(14)\n\nHere I is a 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix.

However none of those matrices is the covariance matrix of the input bipartite\nGaussian state since the vacuum state covariance matrix must be inserted, or the correlation matrix C neglected.\nTherefore, we need a physical measurement process that is able to yield the exact Schur complement of one of the\nlocal covariance matrices. In this section we describe the mathematical operation which is able to realize this task\nand in the next section we describe the physical operation behind it.\nProposition 1: Given a bipartite Gaussian state \u03c112 , the covariance matrix \u03931 describing the Gaussian operator \u03c31\nof mode 1 conditioned to a parity projection over the mode 2,\no\nn\n\u2020\n(19)\n\u03c31 = T r2 ei\u03c0a2 a2 \u03c112 ,\nis given by the Schur complement of the covariance matrix V of the input bipartite state \u03c112 in relation to V2 :\n\u2020\n\u03931 = V1 \u2212 CV\u22121\n2 C .\n\n(20)\n\nProof: We can write the parity operator as an integral over the displacement operator [22, 24], in this case the\nequation (19) can be rewritten as\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\n1\n\u2212s\u20202 Za2\n(21)\n\u03c112 ,\nds2 e\n\u03c31 = T r2\n2\nwith ds2 = d2 s2 = dIm(s2 )dRe(s2 ). As \u03c112 represents a Gaussian state we can write it in the form (2) and replacing\nthis Gaussian form in (21) we have\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\nZ\n\u2020\n1\n\u2212s\u20202 Za2\nz\nEa\n\u2212 12 z\u2020 Vz\n\u03c31 = T r2\nds2 e\ndze\ne\n2\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1\n1 \u2020\n\u2212s\u20202 Za2\nz\nZa\n1 z2 Za2 \u2212 2 z Vz\n1\n= T r2\nds2 e\ndz1 dz2 e\ne\ne\n2\nZ\nZ\nZ\no 1 \u2020\nn\n\u2020\n1\n=\nds2 dz1 dz2 T r2 e(z2 \u2212s2 ) Za2 e\u2212 2 z2 Zz2\n2\n\u2020\n1 \u2020\n1 \u2020\n\u00d7ez1 Za1 e\u2212 2 z Vz e 2 z2 Zs2 ,\n(22)\nbut\no\nn\n2\n\u2020\n1\nT r2 e(z2 \u2212s2 ) Za2 = e\u2212 2 |z2 \u2212s2 | \u03b4 (2) (z2 \u2212 s2 ),\n\n(23)\n\ntherefore\n\u03c31\n\nZ\nZ\n\u2020\n1\n1 \u2020\nz\nZa\n1\n1\n=\ndz1 e\ndz2 e\u2212 2 z Vz\n2\nZ\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1\n1\n\u2212 1 z\u2020 V \u2212CV2 C z1\n= \u221a\n,\ndz1 ez1 Za1 e 2 1 1\n2 det V2\n\nwhere we notice that the resulting state has also a Gaussian form with covariance matrix given by (20).\n\n(24)\n\n\f5\nEXPECTED PARITY AND PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS\n\nIn the previous section we have given a mathematical connection of the Schur complement of a local covariance\n\u2020\nmatrix V2 with the parity operation ei\u03c0a2 a2 over mode 2 of a two-mode Gaussian state and further reduction to\nmode 1. To completely understand the physical meaning of such an operation we must develop a theory for parity\nmeasurement detection.\nIndeed, parity operation properties have received considerable attention recently, in connection to experimentally\naccessible measures, for description of quasiprobability distribution functions for single and entangled systems and\nfor quantum information and computation proposals [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Moreover the average parity of a given\nquantum state is related with its Wigner function [21] at the origin of the phase space and nowadays it can be\nexperimentally determined for radiation fields through photocounting experiments [22, 23], or in microwave cavity\nquantum electrodynamics experiments [24, 25]\nBellow we give a description of the parity measurement process. Given a prior quantum state \u03c1, the post-selected\nstate conditioned to a parity (p = 1, \u22121) measurement is given by\n\u03c1p =\n\nNp \u03c1\n,\nT r {Np \u03c1}\n\nwith probability Pp = T r {Np \u03c1}, where the super-operator Np , p = 1, \u22121 is given by[36]\nX\nNp * =\n|nihn| * |nihn|,\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nn\u2208p\n\ni.e., it indicates projections over even or odd Fock states |ni. For p = 1 the sum runs over even natural numbers, while\nif p = \u22121 it runs over odd natural numbers. The probability for the occurrence of the two events write independently\nas\nX\nhn|\u03c1|ni,\n(27)\nP1 = T r {N1 \u03c1} =\nneven\n\nP\u22121 = T r {N\u22121 \u03c1} =\n\nX\n\nnodd\n\nhn|\u03c1|ni,\n\nand it can be evidenced that P1 + P\u22121 = 1, as it should be. The average parity, p\u0304, is then simply given by\nn\no\nX\nX\nX\n\u2020\nhn|\u03c1|ni \u2212\nhn|\u03c1|ni = T r ei\u03c0a a \u03c1 .\np\u0304 =\npPp =\np\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nnodd\n\nneven\n\nThe average parity was recognized independently by Grossmann [27] and by Royer [28] to be proportional to the\nWigner distribution function at the origin of the phase space:\nW (0) = 2 p\u0304,\n\n(30)\n\nThe values of this function in other points of the phase-space can be achieved by performing displacements over the\ninput state [26, 27, 28], such that\nW (\u03b1) = 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n hn|D(\u03b1)\u03c1D\u2020 (\u03b1)|ni,\n\n(31)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere D(\u03b1) is the displacement operator.\nThis approach can be extended for bipartite systems as given by the density operator \u03c112 . The joint post-selected\n(p)\nstate \u03c112 conditioned to a parity (p = 1, \u22121) measurement over the mode 2 is given by\n(p)\n\n\u03c112 =\n\nNp \u03c112\n,\nT r {Np \u03c112 }\n\nwith probability Pp = T r12 {Np \u03c112 }, and the operation Np , now reads as\nX\nNp * = I1 \u2297\n|nihn|2 * |nihn|2 .\nn\u2208p\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\n\f6\nNow the probability for the occurrence of the two events write as\nX\nhn|\u03c12 |ni2 ,\nP1 = T r2 {N1 \u03c12 } =\n\n(34)\n\nneven\n\nP\u22121 = T r2 {N\u22121 \u03c12 } =\n\nX\n\nnodd\n\nhn|\u03c12 |ni2 ,\n\nwhere \u03c12 = T r1 {\u03c112 }. The average parity of mode 2 is related to its Wigner function as\no\nn\n\u2020\nW2 (0) = 2 p\u0304 = 2 T r12 ei\u03c0a2 a2 \u03c112 ,\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nIn view of this, the significance of the operator \u03c31 is clearly identified as the difference between the states of mode 1\nconditioned to projections on the even Fock subspace and on the odd Fock subspace of mode 2:\nX\nX\nhn|\u03c112 |ni2 \u2212\nhn|\u03c112 |ni2 ,\n(37)\n\u03c31 =\nnodd\n\nneven\n\ni.e., the difference between the states of mode 1 conditioned to even and odd parity measurements on mode 2 out of\nan ensemble of identicaly prepared \u03c112 states.\nFinally, an interesting relation follows from Eq. (). It is immediate to check that the Wigner function of mode 2 at\nthe origin of the phase-space can be inferred by\nW2 (0) = 2 T r1 {\u03c31 }.\n\n(38)\n\nIn this case, this result becomes very interesting, for it means that in a bipartite Gaussian state, the achievement of\nthe Wigner function at the origin of the phase-space of subsystem 2, is the trace of the Gaussian operator of subsystem\n1 \u03c31 , as above, and vice versa. The resulting covariance matrix representing \u03c31 , will be given by (20).\nAlso, from Eq. (36), we can derive a relationship between the Wigner function at the origin of phase space W2 (0)\nof one mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V2 and the Schur complement S(n2 + 12 ) of one diagonal element\nof V2 , which in this case is a scalar, being\nW2 (0) = q\n\n1\n\u0001\n1\n\n,\n\n(39)\n\n1\n1\n|m2 |2\nS(n2 + ) = n2 + \u2212\n.\n2\n2 n2 + 21\n\n(40)\n\nn2 +\n\n2\n\nS(n2 + 12 )\n\nwhere\n\nMoreover, we note that the Wigner function of a mode at the origin of the phase-space, and thus S(n2 + 12 ) is\n\u00012\ndirectly related with the I2 = n2 + 21 \u2212 |m2 |2 element of the four invariant set of the Sp(2, R) \u2297 Sp(2, R) group [9]:\nI1 = det V1 , I2 = det V2 , I3 = det C and I4 = T r[V1 ZCZV2 ZC\u2020 Z].\nAnother way to write \u03c31 is by expanding it in a coherent states basis,\nZ\n\u03c112 = d2 \u03b21 d2 \u03b22 P (\u03b21 , \u03b22 )|\u03b21 , \u03b22 ih\u03b21 , \u03b22 |\n(41)\nwhere P (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ) is the Glauber P function of the joint system \u03c112 . Replacing (41) in (19) and using (36) we have\nZ\nZ\n\u03c31 = d2 \u03b21 |\u03b21 ih\u03b21 | d2 \u03b22 Wc (0)P (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ),\n(42)\n2\n\nwhere Wc (0) = e\u22122|\u03b22 | , is the Wigner function of the coherent state |\u03b22 i (that spans the base of mode 2) at the origin\nof phase space. Thus by defining\nZ\nP(\u03b21 ) \u2261 d2 \u03b22 Wc (0)P (\u03b21 , \u03b22 )\n(43)\n\n\f7\nwe have\n\u03c31 =\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b21 |\u03b21 ih\u03b21 |P(\u03b21 ).\n\n(44)\n\nWhen there is only a reduction of the system without association to a measurement in one subsystem, the P function\nof the reduced state can be obtained by integrating the bipartite state P function, P (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ), over the traced mode\nvariable. But in (41), the P function is associated with a weight in the form of a Gaussian function, where it shows\nthat the values of the P function of \u03c31 over the variables nearly to the origin of the phase space are more important.\nThe influence in mode 1 by a parity measurement in mode 2 can also be noted if we compare the covariance matrix\n(20) with the respective matrix V1 of the reduced operator \u03c11 = T r2 {\u03c112 }, indicating that the parity measurement\ninsert global properties in the local terms of mode 1.\nENTANGLEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF A TWO-MODE BIPARTITE GAUSSIAN STATE\n\nAs we saw in the previous sections, the achievement of the Schur complement structure of a two-mode Gaussian state\ncovariance matrix is related with local parity measurements and the Wigner function at the origin of the phase-space.\nHowever, this result has a main physical interpretation related to the entanglement characterization of a two-mode\nGaussian state via a protocol based on local operations and classical communication (LOCC) as discussed in Ref.\n[13].\nThe protocol consists basically in the attainment of all local sympletic invariants (I1 , I2 , |I3 | and I4 ), discussed in\nthe previous section, via only LOCC and through Proposition 1 of this paper.\nSuppose that Alice and Bob share many copies of a two-mode Gaussian state, where the subsystens related to\nmode 1 are given to Alice and those related to mode 2 to Bob. The quantities I1 and I2 can be locally determined\nby the reconstruction of the submatrices V1 and V2 or by purity measurements of the mode 1 and 2, performed by\nAlice and Bob, respectively. If Alice is the one who want to achieve the entanglement characterization, Bob has to\nsend his matrix or purity outcome to Alice via a classical communication channel. |I3 | and I4 are determined using\nthe Proposition 1, where essencially Alice has to construct the covariance matrix \u03931 (20) from the diference between\nthe correlation matrices of the mode 1 subsystem conditioned to projections onto odd and even states of the mode 2\nsubsystem. For that, Bob has to perform a parity measurement on each subset component letting Alice to know to\nwhich copy does that operation corresponds and the respective outcome, i.e., even parity (eigenvalue 1) or odd parity\n(eigenvalue -1). Alice then separates her copies in two groups, the even (e) and the odd (o) ones, each one containing\nthe copies conditioned by an even and odd parity measurement on Bob's copies respectively, allowing her to obtain\nthe correlation matrices V1e and V1o related to each group. Consequently, the matrix \u03931 is obtainned by subtracting\nthe odd correlation matrix from the even one \u03931 = V1e \u2212 V1o . With this three matrices (V1 , V2 and \u03931 ) in hand,\nAlice is able to completely characterize the Gaussian state's entanglement content as well as its purity without any\nglobal or nonlocal measurements. Two invariants are obtained by I1 = det V1 and I2 = det V2 , while the third one\n|I3 | is calculated from the expression\n|I3 | =\nand the fourth quantity I4 by\n\np\nI2 det(V1 \u2212 \u03931 ),\n\nI4 = I1 I2 + I32 \u2212 I2 det \u03931 .\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nThis four quantities allows, for example, decide whether or not the two-mode Gaussian states is entangled. For\nthat, the Simon separability [29] is the relation used to perform this test, i.e., the state is not entangled if, and only\nif,\n\nI1 I2 +\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212 |I3 |2\n4\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212 I4 \u2265 (I1 + I2 )/4.\n\n(47)\n\nMoreover, for a symmetric state (I1 = I2 ), the entanglement can be quantified via the entanglement of formation\n(Ef ) [30, 31]:\n\n\f8\n\nEf (\u03c112 ) = f\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 q\np\n2 I1 + |I3 | \u2212 I4 + 2I1 |I3 | ,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere f (x) = c+ (x) log2 [c+ (x)] \u2212 c\u2212 (x) log2 [c\u2212 (x)] and c\u00b1 (x) = (x1/2 \u00b1 x1/2 )2 /4. For arbitrary two-mode Gaussian\nstates (I1 6= I2 ) we can work with lower bound for Ef [30] or calculate its negativity or logarithmic negativity [32].\nNote that all the procedures adopted to achieve the four invariants were made without any type of global measurements or operations, allowing to characterize the two-mode Gaussian state's entanglement content via only local\nmeasurements and a classical communication channel.\nPARITY MEASUREMENT IN A N -MODE GAUSSIAN STATE\n\nNow we can generalize the result of theorem 1 for the case of a n-mode Gaussian state.\nProposition 2: Parity measurement in the m mode of\ngiven by\n\uf8eb\nV11 C12\n\uf8ec \u2020\n\uf8ecC\n\uf8ec 12 V22\n\u2020\n\uf8ec \u2020\nV2n\u00d72n = \uf8ec C13 C23\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ed .\nC\u20201n . . .\n\na Gaussian state of n-modes with covariance matrix 2n \u00d7 2n\nC13\n\n...\n\nC1n\n..\n.\n\nC23\nV33\n..\n\n.\n\nC\u2020(n\u22121)n\n\nC(n\u22121)n\nVnn\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(49)\n\nassociate the state of n \u2212 1 resulting modes, in such a manner that the resulting covariance matrix 2(n \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(n \u2212 1)\nis formed by 2 \u00d7 2 block matrices, located in line i and column j, given by\n\u2020\n\u0393ij = Mij \u2212 Mim M\u22121\nmm Mim ,\n\n(50)\n\nsuch that for i = j, Mii = Vi is the covariance matrix of the reduced operator for the subsystem i, and for i 6= j ,\nMij = Cij are the matrices that represent the correlations between the n modes of the global system, noting that in\nthis case Mji = M\u2020ij .\nProof: This proof is made by induction. As we have already derived how a parity measurement in one mode of\na bipartite Gaussian state affect the other mode in terms of the covariance matrix (20), it is possible to derive a\nsimmilar relation for states with 3 and 4 modes and we can verify that there is a standard form between the influence\nof a parity measurement with the resulting reduced covariance matrices, allowing to make a generalization in the case\nof a n-mode state.

We discovered that parity measurements in one mode of a\nglobal bipartite two-mode state influences the other mode in such a manner that there exists a Gaussian operator\nwhose covariance matrix has the form of a Schur complement of one of the local covariance matrices of the input\nstate. This operator is given as the difference between the reduced state of one subsystem conditioned to even and\nodd projections on the other subsystem. As the parity measurement and the Wigner function are strictly related, it\nis possible to associate the Schur complement of a local covariance matrix with the process to achieve the Wigner\nfunction of one mode and, due to the invariance of the Gaussian properties by displacements, with the achievement\nof only one point of this function. At the origin, the Wigner function of an one mode Gaussian state is related with\none element of the four invariant set of the Sp(2, R) \u2297 Sp(2, R) group and so is the Schur complement of a local\ncovariance matrix. Moreover we have generalized the approach for a n-partite Gaussian state verifying that after a\nparity measurement in one mode, the n \u2212 1 system state has a covariance matrix with 2 \u00d7 2 block elements in a form\nof Schur complements of special block matrices. We believe that our findings have both conceptual and practical\nimplications for the development of continuous variable protocols with Gaussian states [13].\nWe are pleased to thank G.

Indeed from that one would obtain Np * =\n\nP\n\nn\u2208p\n\n|nihn| *\n\nP\n\nn\u2208p\n\n|nihn| .\n\nThe completeness relation for the Fock states followed by the fact that Np * for all pratical purposes is always followed by\nthe trace operation lead to the diagonal form of Eq. () convenient for the operator sum representation.\n\n\f"}
