Given a finite abelian\ngroup G and finite R[G]-module M (where R is a commutative ring which contains\nthe values of all characters of G, e.g. R = Z[\u03b6n ], where \u03b6n is a complex n-th root\nof unity), find a formula for the order of M in terms of the orders of the various\nb of G\nisotypic components M \u03c7 of M , where \u03c7 runs over the group of characters G\nand M \u03c7 = {m \u2208 M : \u03c3 m = \u03c7(\u03c3)m for all \u03c3 \u2208 G}. If n denotes the order of G and\none considers R\u2217 = Z[1/n]\u2297Z R, then it is quite easy to find a formula of the desired\ntype for the order of M\u2217 = Z[1/n] \u2297Z M (which we regard as an R\u2217 [G]-module in\nthe natural way), because there is an isomorphism\nM\nM\nM\u2217 \u2243\nM\u2217\u03c7 =\n\u03b5\u2032\u03c7 M\u2217 ,\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\nP\nwhere \u03b5\u2032\u03c7 = (1/n) \u2297 \u03c3\u2208G \u03c7(\u03c3)\u03c3 is the idempotent of the group ring R\u2217 [G] corb (here \u03c7 denotes the inverse of \u03c7). However, if (for example)\nresponding to \u03c7 \u2208 G\nnM = 0, then M\u2217 = 0 and no information is gained on the order of M . A different\napproach involves the \"quasi-idempotents\"\nX\n\u03c7(\u03c3)\u03c3 \u2208 R[G]\n\u03b5\u03c7 =\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\n(note that these elements satisfy \u03b52\u03c7 = n\u03b5\u03c7 ). The first observation that we make is\nthat \u03b5\u03c7 M is no longer equal to M \u03c7 , so it is reasonable to expect that the modules\nM \u03c7 /\u03b5\u03c7 M will play a role in this work. For \u03c7 = \u03c70 (the trivial character of G),\nb 0 (G, M ), where\nM \u03c7 /\u03b5\u03c7 M is the familiar Tate cohomology module M G /NG M = H\nP\nb 0 (G, M ) def\n= M \u03c7 /\u03b5\u03c7 M =\nNG = \u03c3\u2208G \u03c3 is the norm element of R[G]. In general, H\n\u03c7\n0\nb\nH (G, M \u03c7 ), where M \u03c7 is the \u03c7-twist of M (see Section 1 for definitions). Then the\nfollowing holds.\nTheorem 0.2. If G is cyclic and M is a finite R[G]-module, then\ni\nY\nYh\nb 0 (G, M )/S\u03c7 (M ) =\n[M \u03c7 ],\nH\n[M ] *\n\u03c7\nb\nb\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\nb is the submodule of H\nb 0 (G, M ) defined in Section 2,\nwhere S\u03c7 (M ) (for \u03c7 \u2208 G)\n\u03c7\nformula (6).

See Theorem 3.1 below.)\n\n\fFINITE MODULES OVER NON-SEMISIMPLE GROUP RINGS\n\n3\n\nb \u03c70 (G, M ) (and\nIf M is n-divisible, i.e., has no n-torsion, then the modules H\ntherefore also the modules S\u03c7 (M )) vanish.

The interest of Theorem 0.2 is that there may exist other\nb 0 (G, M ) =\ninstances (besides that in which M is n-divisible) where the modules H\n\u03c7\nb 0 (G, M )\nb 0 (G, M \u03c7 ) vanish, and therefore (1) holds. As regards the vanishing of H\nH\n1\nfor an arbitrary G-module M , in Section 4 we use (a slightly generalized version\nof) an impressive theorem of E.Aljadeff [1] and establish the following result.\nTheorem 0.3. Let G be any finite group and let M be any G-module. Assume\nb 0 (H, M ) = 0 for all subgroups H of G of prime order. Then H\nb 0 (H, M ) = 0\nthat H\nfor all subgroups H of G.\n(For an account of the rather unusual and most fortunate way in which I became\naware of the existence of Aljadeff's result, see below.)\nStill in Section 4, we use the duality theorem for finite groups to deduce from\nthe previous theorem the following striking criterion for cohomological triviality.\nTheorem 0.4. Let G be a finite group and let M be a G-module. Assume that\nb \u22121 (H, M ) = H\nb 0 (H, M ) = 0 for all subgroups H of G of prime order. Then M is\nH\ncohomologically trivial.\n(We remind the reader that a G-module M is said to be cohomologically trivial\nb i (H, M ) = 0 for all integers i and all subgroups H of G.)\nif H\nThe above criterion is a significant improvement of the well-known criterion\nestablished by T.Nakayama in the mid 1950's (see [2,\u00a79]). For further comments\non the above result, see the remarks following the proof of Theorem 4.6 below.\nUsing the above criterion, we obtain results of the following type.\nTheorem 0.5. Let p be a prime number and let G be a cyclic group of order\npn , where n \u2265 1. Let H be the unique subgroup of G of order p and let M be a\nb \u03c70 (H, M ) = 0 for all characters \u03c7 of H.

See the remarks following the statement of\nTheorem 6.2 below, where we also comment on the probable value of t.)\nIf K/F does not have exponent 2, then it is necessary to extend scalars. Let\nC K = Z[\u03b6n ] \u2297Z CK , where n is the degree of K/F and \u03b6n is a fixed complex n-th\nroot of unity. Let \u03c6(n) = [(Z/nZ)\u00d7 ]. Then\nTheorem 0.9.

As regards the last assertion of\nCorollary 0.11, it is of course an allusion to Vandiver's conjecture, which asserts\nthat h+ is never divisible by p. Regarding this conjecture, the results of this paper\nseem to indicate that the following statement is true: Vandiver's conjecture holds\nfor p if and only if p does not divide hL for every subextension L/Q of Q(\u03b6p )+ /Q\nof prime degree. See Section 6 for additional comments.\nWe also note that the results of this paper have applications to \"non-semisimple\"\nIwasawa theory, which we hope to develop in a future publication.\nFinally, I would like to share with the reader the following anecdote connected\nwith the writing of this paper. In August of 2001 I attended the XIV Coloquio\nLatinoamericano de Algebra, which took place in La Falda, Argentina. There I\nhad the opportunity to meet many distinguished mathematicians, including V.Kac,\nB.Kostant and D.Sullivan. At one point during the conference I noticed D. Sullivan\nand E. Aljadeff having a conversation in the main hall. After observing them for a\nfew seconds, it became clear to me that Sullivan wanted to part ways in order to\nattend to some other bussiness, but did not want to leave Aljadeff alone. So as I\nwas passing by them Sullivan waved to me to stop and said to Aljadeff: \"Eli, tell\nChris what you just told me\", and then left. Aljadeff then proceeded to explain to\nme his result on the surjectivity of the norm map (see Theorem 4.1 below), which\nwas exactly the type of result I needed to complete this paper. The conclusion is\nclear. D.Sullivan furthers the advancement of Mathematics even without trying.\nAcknowledgements\nI am very grateful to E. Aljadeff for explaining to me his results on the norm\nmap and for providing me with a copy of his paper [1].

GONZALEZ-AVILES\n\n1. Preliminaries\nLet G be a finite group of exponent e and let \u03c7 : G \u2192 F be a character (onedimensional representation) of G with values in some field F which contains a\nprimitive e-th root of unity \u03b6e (e.g. F = C). A commutative ring (with unit) R\nis said to be large enough for G if there exists a ring homomorphism Z[\u03b6e ] \u2192 R.\nm\nFor example, Z[\u03b6e ] and Fp [x]/(xp ) (e = pm a prime power) are large enough for\nG. Since \u03c7 : G \u2192 F factors through Z[\u03b6e ], we may compose \u03c7 with the given\nhomomorphism Z[\u03b6e ] \u2192 R to obtain a multiplicative map G \u2192 R, which will\nalso be denoted by \u03c7. Thus \u03c7 : G \u2192 R is a \"character of G with values in R\".\nClearly the values of \u03c7 lie in R\u00d7 (the group of units of R), so \u03c7 is an element of\nb = Hom(G, R\u00d7 ).\nG\nNow let M be an R[G]-module, where R is large enough for G, and consider the\naugmentation homomorphism\nX\nX\n\u03b1\u03c7 : R[G] \u2192 R,\nr\u03c3 \u03c3 7\u2192\nr\u03c3 \u03c7(\u03c3).\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\nFor each i \u2265 0, we define the R-modules\nH\u03c7i (G, M ) = ExtiR[G ] (R, M ),\nwhere R is being regarded as an R[G]-module via the map \u03b1\u03c7 . For i = 0 we have\nH\u03c70 (G, M ) = HomR[G ] (R, M ) = M \u03c7 ,\nwhere M \u03c7 = {m \u2208 M : \u03c3 m = \u03c7(\u03c3)m for all \u03c3 \u2208 G}.\nNow consider the element\nX\n\u03c7(\u03c3)\u03c3 \u2208 R[G],\n\u03b5\u03c7 =\n\u03c3\u2208G\n\nwhere \u03c7 denotes the inverse of \u03c7 (i.e., \u03c7(\u03c3) = \u03c7(\u03c3)\u22121 for all \u03c3 \u2208 G). It is not\ndifficult to check that \u03b5\u03c7 M \u2282 M \u03c7 . Define\nb 0 (G, M ) = M \u03c7 /\u03b5\u03c7 M.\nH\n\u03c7\nIf M is a Z[G]-module and \u03c7 is the trivial character of G, then the Z-modules\nb \u03c70 (G, M ) defined above are the well-known groups H 0 (G, M ) =\nH\u03c7i (G, M ) and H\nG\n0\nb\nM and H (G, M ) = M G /NG M from Group Cohomology. In general, the Rb 0 (G, M ) are \"usual\" cohomology modules of a twisted\nmodules H\u03c7i (G, M ) and H\n\u03c7\nform of M . Indeed, if M \u03c7 denotes the R-module M endowed with the new G-action\n\u03c3 * m = \u03c7(\u03c3)\u03c3 m\nthen\n\n(\u03c3 \u2208 G, m \u2208 M ),\n\nb i (G, M ) = H\nb i (G, M \u03c7 )\nH\n\u03c7\n\nfor all i \u2265 0 (this follows in a standard way from the fact that the functor M 7\u2192 M \u03c7\n0\nis the composite of the functors M 7\u2192 M \u03c7 and M 7\u2192 M \u03c7 , the second of which is\nexact and right adjoint to an exact functor, namely M 7\u2192 M\u03c7 .)\n\n\fFINITE MODULES OVER NON-SEMISIMPLE GROUP RINGS\n\n7\n\n2. Cyclic groups\nWe assume now that G is a finite cyclic group and write n for its order. Let M\nbe a finite R[G]-module, where R is large enough for G. Then there exists a ring\nhomomorphism Z[\u03b6n ] \u2192 R, where \u03b6n is a primitive (say complex) n-th root of unity.\nWe will continue to write \u03b6n for the image of \u03b6n in R under the above homomorphism\n(this should cause no confussion). We now choose and fix a generator \u03c4 of G and\ndefine a character \u03c7 : G \u2192 R\u00d7 by \u03c7(\u03c4 ) = \u03b6n . Then any other character of G is of\nthe form \u03c7i , where 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 (by convention \u03c70 is the trivial character of G,\ni.e., \u03c70 (\u03c3) = 1 for all \u03c3 \u2208 G).\nP\nNow recall the elements \u03b5\u03c7i = \u03c3\u2208G \u03c7 i (\u03c3)\u03c3 \u2208 R[G], where 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1.

We will use the following notation.\nIf a is any element of R[G], Ker a will denote the kernel of multiplication-by-a on\nM (note that this is simply a nonstandard notation for the a-torsion submodule\ni\nof M ). We note that M \u03c7 = {m \u2208 M : \u03c4 m = \u03b6 ni m} = Ker (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b6 ni ). The order\nof a finite module M will be denoted by [M ]. Now, in order to make our general\narguments more transparent, we will begin by examining the simplest case, that in\nwhich n = 2.

A criterion for cohomological triviality.\nIn this section we establish a new criterion for cohomological triviality using an\nimpressive theorem of E.Aljadeff. We then apply this criterion to derive sufficient\nconditions under which the order of a finite R[G]-module M (where G is abelian\nand R is large enough for G) equals the product of the orders of the various isotypic\nb In this section, \"G-module\" means\ncomponents M \u03c7 of M , where \u03c7 ranges over G.\nZ[G]-module.\nWe begin by recalling Aljadeff's result.\nTheorem 4.1 (Aljadeff). Let G be a finite group and let K be a G-module which\nb 0 (H, K) = 0 for all subgroups\nis also a commutative ring with unit. Suppose that H\nb 0 (H, K) = 0 for all subgroups H of G.\nH of G of prime order. Then H\n\nProof. See [1, Theorem 0.1]. \u0003\nRemark. Aljadeff's proof of the above result uses certain modules over the twisted\ngroup ring K t G, where t : G \u2192 Aut(K) is the map inducing the action of G on\nK. An alternative proof of the theorem, for G abelian, can be given (with some\neffort) using the inflation-restriction exact sequence in group cohomology together\nwith [2, \u00a79, Lemma 1].\n\n\fFINITE MODULES OVER NON-SEMISIMPLE GROUP RINGS\n\n11\n\nWe will now extend Aljadeff's result to arbitrary G-modules. Note that any\nG-module M is in particular an abelian group, so it is meaningful to consider the\ngroup ring Z[M ], which is a G-module (with G acting trivially on Z) as well as a\ncommutative ring with unit.\nProposition 4.2. Let H be a group of prime order and let M be an H-module.\nWrite NH for the norm element of Z[H]. Then\n\u0003\n\u0002\nZ[M ]H = Z M H + NH Z[M ].\n\nProof. To prove the nontrivial\ncontainment, we need only check that Z[M \\\nP\nM H ]H \u2282 NH Z[M ]. Let m\u2208M\\M H am m be an element of Z[M \\ M H ]H , with\nam = 0 for all but finitely many m \u2208 M \\ M H . Then am = a\u03c3m for all m \u2208 M \\ M H\nand any \u03c3 \u2208 H. Thus we can write\nX\nX\nX\nai\nam m =\nm,\nm\u2208M\\M H\n\ni\n\nm\u2208Mi\n\nwhere the Mi are the various orbits of the action of H on M \\ M H and ai is the\ncommon value of am as m ranges over Mi . Now the stabilizer in H of an element\nm \u2208 M \\ M H is necessarily trivial,\nP because it is a proper subgroup of a group\nof prime order. It follows that\nm\u2208Mi m = NH mi for any mi \u2208 Mi , and the\nproposition follows. \u0003\nCorollary 4.3. Let H be a group of prime order and let M be an H-module.\nb 0 (H, M ) = 0. Then H\nb 0 (H, Z[M ]) = 0.\nSuppose that H\n\nTheorem 4.4. Let G be any finite group and let M be any G-module. Suppose\nb 0 (H, M ) = 0 for all subgroups H of G of prime order.

Let H be any subgroup of G and P\nconsider the surjective H-module homomorphism Z[M ] \u2192 M defined by mapping am m \u2208 Z[M ] to the actual sum in M .\nThis map admits a section as a map of H-modules, namely m 7\u2192 1 * m. Therefore\nb 0 (H, M ) is a direct summand of H\nb 0 (H, Z[M ]). On the other hand, by hypothesis\nH\nb 0 (H, Z[M ]) = 0 for every subgroup\nand Theorem 4.1 together with Corollary 4.3, H\nH of G. The theorem is now clear. \u0003\nNext, we will use Theorem 4.4 and the duality theorem for finite groups to\nestablish the criterion for cohomological triviality mentioned earlier.\nFor any abelian group M , we will write M \u2217 = Hom(M, Q/Z) for the Pontrjagyn\ndual of M .\nLemma 4.5. Let G be a finite group and let M be any G-module. Suppose that\nb \u22121 (H, M ) = 0 for all subgroups H of G of prime order. Then H\nb \u22121 (H, M ) = 0\nH\nfor all subgroups H of G.\nProof. By the duality theorem for finite groups [3, p.250], for every subgroup H\nof G of prime order\nb 0 (H, M \u2217 ) \u2243 H\nb \u22121 (H, M )\u2217 = 0.\nH\nb 0 (H, M \u2217 ) = 0 for every subgroup H of G.

Then M is\nH\ncohomologically trivial.\nProof. Let p be a prime number and let Gp be a p-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, by\nb \u22121 (Gp , M ) = H\nb 0 (Gp , M ) = 0. Now the well-known\nTheorem 4.4 and Lemma 4.5, H\ncriterion of T.Nakayama [2, \u00a79, Theorem 9(i)] completes the proof. \u0003\nRemarks. (a) By the periodicity of the cohomology of cyclic groups [2], the\nb i (H, M ) = H\nb j (H, M ) = 0 for all\nhypothesis of the theorem can be replaced by: H\nsubgroups H of G of prime order and any pair of integers i, j which differ by an\nodd integer.\n(b) Theorem 4.6 is a significant improvement of the criterion of T.Nakayama\nused in its proof. For example, if G is a cyclic group of order pn (where p is a prime\nand n \u2265 1) and M is a G-module, then the cohomological triviality of M can be\nb i (H, M ) is zero for i = \u22121, 0\nchecked \"at the first layer\", i.e., by checking whether H\nand H the unique subgroup of G of order p. Nakayama's criterion requires that one\ncheck the vanishing of these cohomology groups for the full group (i.e., for H = G),\na verification that depends on the (possibly very large) value of n.\n(c) We also note that Theorem 4.6 can be used to weaken the hypotheses of some\nwell-known theorems in group cohomology which depend on Nakayama's criterion,\ne.g., the Nakayama-Tate theorem.\nRecall that if H is a finite cyclic group and M is an H-module the groups\nb i (H, M ) for i = \u22121, 0 are given by\nH\nb \u22121 (H, M ) = NHM /IH M\nH\n\nb 0 (H, M ) = M H /NH M,\nand H\n\nwhere NHM is (the standard notation for) the kernel of multiplication by NH on M\nand IH is the augmentation ideal of Z[H] (see for example [2]).

This follows at once from Theorems 3.1 and 4.10. \u0003\nRemark. The above theorem cannot be considered satisfactory because of its\nrather stringent hypotheses. We have stated it only for completeness and will not\ngive applications of it.\n5. Applications to abelian varieties\nLet F be a global field, i.e., F is a finite extension of Q (the \"number field\ncase\") or is finitely generated and of transcendence degree 1 over a finite field (the\n\"function field case\"). Let A be an abelian variety defined over F and let K/F be\na finite Galois extension with Galois group G. We will write AF (resp. AK ) for\nthe abelian variety A regarded as an abelian variety over F (resp. K), and At will\ndenote the abelian variety dual to A. Further, for any prime w of K, we will write\nGw for Gal(Kw /Fv ), where v is the prime of F lying below w, and will identify this\ngroup with the decomposition group of w in G.\nProposition 5.1. Let w be any prime of K, let v be the prime of F lying below\nw and let L/Fv be a subextension of Kw /Fv such that H = Gal(Kw /L) is cyclic.\nThen the Herbrand quotient of the H-module A(Kw ) is 1.\nProof. Let f : A \u2192 At be any isogeny and write Af for the kernel of f . Then\nthere is an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Af (K w ) \u2192 A(K w ) \u2192 At (K w ) \u2192 0,\nwhere K w is a separable algebraic closure of Kw . Taking Gal(K w /Kw )-invariants\nof the above exact sequence, we conclude that there exists an H-module homomorphism A(Kw ) \u2192 At (Kw ) having a finite kernel and cokernel. Consequently\nh(A(Kw )) = h(At (Kw )). On the other hand local duality [9, I.3.4, 3.7; III.7.8] (see\nalso [8, 4.2]) shows that h(A(Kw )) h(At (Kw )) = 1. Thus h(A(Kw ))2 = 1, whence\nh(A(Kw )) = 1. \u0003\nRemark. There is an alternative proof of Proposition 5.1 in the case where Kw\nis non-archimedean of characteristic zero. This proof uses a well-known theorem of\nMattuck and therefore depends on the theory of the logarithm. See [12, \u00a74, (14)].\nCorollary 5.2. Let v be a real prime of F . Then A(Fv ) is connected if and only\nAt (Fv ) is connected.\nb 0 (Fv , A) = 0 or, equivaProof. By [9, I.3.7], A(Fv ) is connected if and only if H\n1\nt\nlently, if and only if H (Fv , A ) = 0 (by duality). The proposition (applied to some\ntotally imaginary finite Galois extension of F ) shows that the latter is equivalent\nb 0 (Fv , At ), i.e., to the connectedness of At (Fv ). \u0003\nto the vanishing of H\nRemark.

Let v be any prime of F and let w be a fixed prime of K lying\nabove v. Assume that A(L) = NKw /L A(Kw ) for all subextensions L/Fv of Kw /Fv\nof prime index, i.e., such that [Kw : L] is prime. Then the Gw -module A(Kw ) is\ncohomologically trivial.\nProof. The theorem follows from Proposition 5.1 and Corollary 4.8. \u0003\nRemark. With the notations of the theorem, suppose that Kw /L is ramified of\nprime degree p. Write l for the residue field of L.

However, we\nhave not looked into this problem closely and are therefore unable to comment\nfurther on it at the present time.\nNext we recall the main theorem of [6]. We will write T for the set of primes of\nF which ramify in K/F or where A has bad reduction.\nTheorem 5.4. Notations being as above, suppose that the following conditions\nhold.\n(i) The Tate-Shafarevich group W(AK ) of AK is finite.\nb i (G, A(K)) = H\nb i (G, At (K)) = 0 for all integers i.\n(ii) H\n(iii) A(Fv ) is connected for all real primes v of F .\nThen\nY\n\u0003\n\u0002\nW(AK )G = [W(AF )] *\n[H 1 (Gw , A(Kw ))]\nv\u2208T\n\nand\n[H 1 (G, W(AK ))] =\n\nY\n\n[H 2 (Gw , A(Kw ))],\n\nv\u2208T\n\nwhere, for each prime v \u2208 T , w is a fixed prime of K lying above v.\nProof. See [6], Theorem 4.4. \u0003\nRemarks. (a) The above result, which was established in [6] for number fields\nonly, is in fact valid for any global field. This is so because [9], which was the main\nreference for [6], covers both the number field and function field cases (one only\nneeds to supplement some of the references made in [6] to results from Chapter I\nof [9] with references to Chapter III of the same book).\n(b) As pointed out by the referee of [6], the conditions of the theorem \"[seem]\nrather stringent but hold in fact quite often\". Aljadeff's theorem ultimately tells\nus why this is so. Consider for example the case of a p-group G, where p is a prime\nnumber. Then condition (ii) of the theorem is equivalent to the cohomological\ntriviality of both A(K) and At (K).

Applications to class groups of number fields\nIf G is a finite group and M is a finite Z[G]-module, then the results of \u00a74 do\nnot immediately apply to M because Z is not large enough for G. Therefore we\nneed to extend scalars, i.e., consider the ring R = Z[\u03b6e ], where e is the exponent of\nG and \u03b6e is a fixed (complex) e-th root of unity. Define\nM = M \u2297Z R.\nClearly, M is an R[G]-module of order [M ]\u03c6(e) , where \u03c6 is Euler's function. More\nprecisely, let B = {\u03b6ei : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03c6(e) \u2212 1}. Then the elements of M may be regarded\n\n\f18\n\nCRISTIAN D.

Let K/F be an abelian extension of number fields with Galois group\nG of exponent e. Let G = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hr (r \u2265 1) be a decomposition of G as a direct\nproduct of cyclic groups. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1, let Gi = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hi , where G0 is\ndefined to be {0}. Then\n(hK /hF )\u03c6(e) *\n\nr\nY\n\ni=1\n\ni\nY h\nY\n\u03c7\nb 0 (Hi , C \u03c8 )/S\u03c7 (C \u03c8 ) =\nH\n[C K ].\nK\nK\n\u03c7\ni\ni\n\nbi\n\u03c7i\u2208H\n\nb\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nbi\u22121\n\u03c8\u2208G\n\nAdmittedly the above formula is rather complicated, but is not without interesting applications, as we now show. One immediate observation is that the product\nwhich appears on the left-hand side of the above formula is an integer which is\ndivisible only by the primes that divide e. This comes from the fact that multiplib 0 (Hi , C \u03c8 ). Further, writing each of\ncation by e annihilates each of the groups H\n\u03c7i\nK\nb \u03c70 (G, C K )], we see at once\nthe factors on the right-hand side in the form [\u03b5\u03c7 C K ][H\nthat there exists a positive rational number r, whose numerator and denominator\nare divisible only by primes that divide e, such that\nY\n[\u03b5\u03c7 C K ].\nr * (hK /hF )\u03c6(e) =\n(8)\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nThus, for example, if G is a p-elementary abelian group, where p is a prime, then\nthe formula of the theorem is an identity of the type\nY\n[\u03b5\u03c7 C K ],\npt * (hK /hF ) p\u22121 =\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nwhere t is an integer (which may be positive, negative or zero). On the probable\nvalue of t, see below. When p = 2 the situation is particularly simple, because in\nthis case there is no need to extend scalars (R = Z). We have\nCorollary 6.2. Let K/F be a finite abelian extension of exponent 2. Then there\nexists an integer t such that\nY\n[\u03b5\u03c7 CK ],\n2t * (hK /hF ) =\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nwhere the product extends over all non-trivial characters of G.\nRegarding the formula of the corollary, the factors [\u03b5\u03c7 CK ] which appear on the\nright-hand side are (or seem to be) related to the class numbers of the various\nsubextensions of K/F . For example.\n\n\fFINITE MODULES OVER NON-SEMISIMPLE GROUP RINGS\n\n19\n\n\u221a \u221a\nExample. ( See [13, Theorem 10.10, p.191]) Let K = Q( d1 , d2 ) be a biquadratic extension of the rational field, where d1 and d2 are squarefree integers.\nLet \u03c7j (j = 1, 2, 3) denote the nontrivial characters of G = Gal(K/F ),pand assume\nthat the numbering has been chosen so that Lj = Fix(Ker \u03c7j ) = Q( dj ), where\nd3 = d1 d2 . Write\n{1, \u03c4 } = Gal(K/L1 )\n\n{1, \u03c3} = Gal(K/L2 )\n\n{1, \u03c3\u03c4 } = Gal(K/L3 ),\nand set \u03b5\u03c7j = \u03b5j (j = 1, 2, 3). Then \u03b51 = (1 \u2212 \u03c3)(1 + \u03c4 ), \u03b52 = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )(1 + \u03c3) and\n\u03b53 = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )(1 \u2212 \u03c3). We have \u03b51 CK = (1 \u2212 \u03c3)NK/L1 CK and, moreover, \u03c3 acts on\nNK/L1 CK as multiplication by \u22121 since\n(1 + \u03c3)NK/L1 CK = NL1 /Q NK/L1 CK = 0.\ndef\n\nIt follows that [\u03b51 CK ] differs from h1 = [CL1 ] by a power of 2. Similarly, [\u03b52 CK ]\ndiffers from h2 = [CL2 ] by a power of 2. On the other hand \u03b53 CK = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )(1 +\n\u03c3\u03c4 )CK = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )NK/L3 CK , and we conclude as before that [\u03b53 CK ] differs from\nh3 = [CL3 ] by a power of 2. Summarizing, there exists an integer t such that\n2 t * hK = h1 h2 h3 .\nRemarks. (a) The formula of the example is certainly not new. A more precise\nversion of it [5, Theorem 74, p.320] follows from the classical Brauer relations [Ibid.,\nTheorem 73, p.315]. Incidentally, it looks like an interesting problem to compare\nthe class number formulas of this section with those obtained by R.Brauer through\nanalytical means. Since the latter involve the regulators of a field and its various\nsubfields, while the formulas of this section do not, it seems likely that some nontrivial relations among regulators will emerge, generalizing [Op.Cit., formula (7.27),\np.320]. Regarding this last remark, some readers may be surprised by the fact that\nthe units of the field do not seem to play a role in our formulas. In fact, the units\nlurk in the background. See the next remark.\n(b) To determine the exact value of r in (8), at least under the assumption that\nK/F is cyclic, one would proceed as follows. It is known that the ideal class group\nof a number field K is the Tate-Shafarevich group of the units of K, i.e.,\nY\n\u0002\n\u0003\nCK \u2243 Ker H 1 (K, UK ) \u2192\nH 1 (Kw , Uw ) .\nSee [4]. Thus, by using the methods of [6], it should not be difficult to obtain\nb 0 (G, CK ) similar to the identity [H\nb 0 (G, W(AK ))] =\na formula for the order of H\nQ\n0\nb\nv\u2208T [H (Gw , A(Kw ))] of Corollary 5.5, at least under the additional assumption\nb 0 (G, UK ) = 0, holds.\nthat the analog of condition (ii) of Theorem 5.4, namely H\n0\nb\nWithout this assumption, a formula for [H (G, CK )] should involve the ramification\nb 0 (Gw , Uw )] (where v is the prime of F lying below w), the order\nindices e(w/v) = [H\nb 0 (G, UK ), and possibly some other familiar constants. For a clear indication\nof H\nthat this is so see [11], where the author essentially computes a \"toric analogue\"\nb 0 (G, CK )]. The above comments, although not immediately applicable to the\nof [H\nb 0 (Hi , C \u03c8 )] for non-trivial characters \u03c7i and \u03c8, should\nproblem of computing [H\nK\n\u03c7i\nhowever give an indication as to what to expect regarding the value of r in (8).\nThe next theorem generalizes a well-known consequence of class field theory.\n\n\f20\n\nCRISTIAN D. GONZALEZ-AVILES\n\nTheorem 6.3. Let K/F be a finite Galois extension of number fields. Suppose\nthat for every subextension of prime index L/F of K/F the extension K/L ramifies at some prime. Then the norm map NK/L : CK \u2192 CL is surjective for each\nsubextension L/F of K/F . In particular, hL divides hK for every subextension\nL/F of K/F .\nProof. The hypothesis implies that K \u2229 HL = L for every L/F \u2282 K/F of prime\nindex, where HL is the Hilbert class field of L. A well-known consequence of class\nfield theory [7, Lemma, p. 83] then shows that NK/L : CK \u2192 CL is surjective for\nall subextensions L/F of K/F of prime index. Theorem 4.4 now implies that NK/L\nis surjective for all subextensions L/F of K/F . The last assertion of the theorem\nis clear. \u0003\nTheorem 6.4. Let K/F be a cyclic Galois extension of number fields with Galois\ngroup G of order n. Assume that K/F satisfies the conditions of Theorem 6.3\nabove. Then\nY\nY\n[\u03b5\u03c7 C K ],\n(hK /hF )\u03c6(n) =\n[S\u03c7 (C K )] *\nb\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nb\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nwhere the integers [S\u03c7 (C K )] (which were defined in Section 2, formula (6)) are\ndivisible only by the primes that divide n.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 2.2. \u0003\nRemarks. (a) As noted earlier, the factors [\u03b5\u03c7 C K ] which appear in the formula\nof the theorem seem to be related to the class numbers of the various subextensions\nof K/F . In particular if n = p is a prime the identity of the theorem should\nreduce to a trivial factorization of the type (hK /hF )p\u22121 = (hK /hF ) * * * (hK /hF )\n\u03c7\n(p \u2212 1 factors). In general, the computation of [\u03b5\u03c7 C K ] (or [C K ]) in terms of class\nnumbers of subextensions of K/F seems to be a problem in linear algebra. For\nexample, if \u03c4 is a fixed generator of G and \u03c7 is given by \u03c7(\u03c4 ) = \u03b6n , then there is a\nnatural isomorphism\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c6(n)\n\nCK \u2243 {m \u2208 CK\n\n: \u03c4 m = Am},\n\nwhere A is the companion matrix 4 of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6n (x) (this\nfollows from (7). Incidentally, if n is a prime then the above \"eigenspace\" is nat\u03c7i\n\nurally isomorphic to CK ). However, we do not yet know if CK (2 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1)\nadmits a similar description. Whatever the case may be, it appears at this time\nthat the identity\nY\n\u0001\nNK/L =\n\u03a6d \u03c4 [L:F ]\nd|[K:L]\nd>1\n\n\u03c7i\n\nwill play a role in the computation of [CK ] in terms of the class numbers of the\nvarious subextensions of K/F .\n4 Or the transpose of the companion matrix, depending on which definition of \"companion\nmatrix\" one adopts.\n\n\fFINITE MODULES OVER NON-SEMISIMPLE GROUP RINGS\n\n21\n\n(b) Let p be an odd prime and let K = Q(\u03b6p )+ be the maximal real subfield of\nQ(\u03b6p ). We write h+ for the class number of K. For F = Q, the formula of the\ntheorem becomes\nY\np\u22121\n[\u03b5\u03c7 C K ],\n(h+ )\u03c6( 2 ) = r *\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nwhere r is an integer which is divisible only by the primes that divide (p \u2212 1)/2.\nIn particular, p divides h+ if and only if p divides [\u03b5\u03c7 C K ] for some (non-trivial)\ncharacter \u03c7 of G, i.e., Vandiver's conjecture holds for p if and only if p does not\ndivide [\u03b5\u03c7 C K ] for each character \u03c7 of G. Concerning this conjecture, the results of\nthis paper (cf. previous remark) seem to indicate that the following statement is\ntrue: p does not divide h+ if and only if p does not divide hL for every subextension\nL/Q of K/Q of prime degree. More generally, the results of this section seem to\nsuggest that for a large class of abelian extensions of a given number field (perhaps\nthat which consists of the fields satisfying the conditions of Theorem 6.3), the class\nnumbers of its subextensions of prime degree to a large extent determine the class\nnumbers of all its subextensions.\nWe conclude this paper with the following statement.\nTheorem 6.5. Let K/F be a cyclic Galois extension with Galois group G of order\n2n , where n \u2265 1. Assume that K/F ramifies at some prime. Then\nY\nn\u22121\n(hK /hF )2\n=\n[\u03b5\u03c7C K ].\n\u03c76=\u03c70\n\nProof. The hypothesis implies that K/L ramifies at some prime, where L/F is\nthe unique subextension of K/F of index 2. Therefore, by Theorem 6.4, NK/L is\nsurjective. The theorem now follows from Corollary 4.11. \u0003\nReferences\n1. Aljadeff, E., On the surjectivity of some trace maps, Israel J.
