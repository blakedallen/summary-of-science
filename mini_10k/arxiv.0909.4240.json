Except for predicting various low energy parameters with an unexpected precision, it joins together many traditional approaches\nto describe strong interactions, such as nonlinear chiral symmetry realization, hidden local\nsymmetry, QCD sum rule, light-cone perturbative theory, etc. However, it also suffers from\nmany problems, one of which is the description of the experimentally well established Regge\ntrajectories of hadron spectrum. To overcome this, people propose to select a special background, namely a quadratically increasing dilaton together with a five dimensional anti\nde Sitter (AdS) space-time [2]. Fields propagating in this background satisfy harmonicoscillator type equations, and give exactly Regge trajectories for various mesons. The model\nbased on this background is often called soft-wall model, to be compared with the hard-wall\nmodel [3], where the background is a slice of AdS space-time.\nWhile Regge behavior is well described in this model, we now run into new troubles when\ntrying to incorporating chiral symmetry breaking. If we introduce a tachyonlike scalar field\nX to break chiral symmetry as in the hard-wall model, the solution for the expectation\nvalue of X now diverges exponentially in the infrared (IR) limit. This is unreasonable,\nsince every physical mode should be regular in the bulk region according to the standard\nAdS/CFT prescription [4]. Practically, this solution adds an exponentially increasing term\nto the equation for the axial modes, and the previously obtained Regge behavior was ruined.\nThere has been some attempt to overcome this problem by adding higher dimensional terms\nto the potential of X [5], see also [6]. A simpler way is to change the sign of the dilaton, and\npush the divergence into the background. This may seem a little rude, but it does regularize\nthe divergent solution. Meantime, it gives the same Regge trajectories for the vector mesons,\nwhich has already been pointed out in Ref. [2]. Moreover, explicit calculations show that\nvarious mesons, including axial and pseudoscalar ones, will fall on Regge trajectories with\nthe same slope.\nAnother motivation comes from the consideration of confinement property of the background. The original soft-wall background is in some sense equivalent to adding a Gaussian\n2\n\n2\n\nfactor e\u2212z to the AdS metric. In Ref. [7] an alternative deformation factor ez was shown to\nresult confining potential between heavy quarks. It is just this increasing exponential which\n2\n\n\fguarantees the confining property, according to the general criterion in Ref. [8]. Therefore,\nin order to obtain linear Regge trajectories in a confining background, one is naturally led\nto consider a negative dilaton \u03a6 \u223c \u2212z 2 . Since the dilaton contributes to the action in the\n\nform e\u2212\u03a6 , which now increases quickly in the IR region, this kind of background includes\nactually a quasi-hard wall, not a soft wall any more.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I show that in the modified\nbackground chiral symmetry breaking can be naturally incorporated. The Regge trajectories\nof various mesons, including the axial and pseudoscalar mesons, can be reproduced in the\nimproved model. Some comments on the confining property of the background is given in\nSec.III. In the last section I give a short summary.\n\nII.\n\nIMPROVED SOFT-WALL MODEL\n\nThe five dimensional AdS space-time can be given in the Poincar\u00e9 coordinate as:\ngM N dxM dxN =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n2\n,\n\u03b7\ndx\ndx\n\u2212\ndz\n\u03bc\u03bd\nz2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = Diag (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) and \u03bc, \u03bd = (0, 1, 2, 3), M, N = (0, 1, 2, 3, z). The dilaton is\nnow chosen to be\n\u03a6(z) = \u2212\u039b2 z 2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich has an opposite sign to that in the original soft-wall model [2]. This kind of background\nwas shown to exist in some tachyon-dilaton-gravity system [9], where the close string tachyon\nplays the role of the dilaton field here. The nontrivial dilaton profile violates scale invariance\nexplicitly, and introduces a scale \u039b into the boundary theory. We choose to set \u039b to be 1 and\nrecover it from dimensional analysis when needed. As in Ref. [3], one introduces two sets\nof gauge fields, AL and AR , to represent the gauged chiral symmetry. Then this symmetry\nis broken both explicitly and spontaneously by employing a tachyonic scalar field X. With\nthe dilaton turned on, the action reads:\nS=\n\nZ\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n1\n\u221a\nd x g e\u2212\u03a6 Tr (D M X)\u2020 (DM X) + 3X \u2020 X \u2212 2 (FLM N FLM N + FRM N FRM N ) , (3)\n4g5\n5\n\nwhere A = Aa ta , FM N = \u2202M AN \u2212 \u2202N AM \u2212 i[AM , AN ], DX = \u2202X \u2212 iAL X + iXAR . The\n\ngenerators of the gauge group are normalized as Tr ta tb = \u03b4 ab /2.\n\n3\n\n\fA.\n\nVacuum Solution\n\nA nonzero expectation value X0 of X will breaks the SU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R symmetry to\nthe vector part. So one first takes AL and AR to be zero and solves the equation of motion\nfor X. Denote the v(z) = 2X0 , then v(z) satisfies the following equation:\n\u2202z\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1 \u2212\u03a6(z)\n1\ne\n\u2202\nv(z)\n+ 3 5 e\u2212\u03a6(z) v(z) = 0\nz\n3\nz\nz\n\n(4)\n\nThe solution is given by\nv(z) = C1 v1 (z) + C2 v2 (z),\n2\n\nwith v1 (z) = ze\u2212z U(\u22121/2, 0; z 2 ) and v2 = z 3 e\u2212z\n\n2\n\n1 F1 (1/2, 2; z\n\n(5)\n2\n\n). Here U is the Tricomi\n\u221a\nfunction, and 1 F1 the Kummer function. Since U(\u22121/2, 0; z 2 ) \u2192 1/ \u03c0 and 1 F1 goes to\n\u221a\nunity as z \u2192 0, one can identify C1 / \u03c0 as the quark mass and C2 the condensate so that\n\u221a\n2\nv(z) \u223c mq z + \u03c3z 3 . When z \u2192 \u221e, v1 (z) vanishes as z 2 e\u2212z and v2 (z) \u2192 1/ \u03c0, while in\n2\n\nthe original model one solution goes to a constant and the other diverges like z 2 ez . So\n\nthe divergence of v(z) is successfully absorbed into the background, and now v(z) becomes\nregular in the bulk. This will be important in guaranteeing the Regge trajectories of the\naxial and pseudoscalar mesons, as shown in the following.\n\nB.\n\nVector Sector\n\nNow consider the fluctuations around the vacuum, which will correspond to the bound\nstates of various mesons. First we consider the fluctuations from the vector combination\nV = (AL + AR )/2. Taking the axial gauge Vz = 0 and performing Fourier transformation in\nthe x direction, the transverse components V\u03bcT then satisfy the following equation:\n\u2202z (e\u2212B \u2202z V\u03bcT (q, z)) + q 2 e\u2212B V\u03bcT (q, z) = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere B = \u03a6(z) + log z. The normalizable solutions vn , obtained at q 2 = m2vn , are then\nconsidered to be dual to vector mesons. Applying a Bogoliubov transformation vn = eB/2 \u03c8nv ,\none obtains a Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u2212 \u03c8nv \u2032\u2032 + Vv (z)\u03c8nv = m2vn \u03c8nv ,\n\n(7)\n\nVv (z) = (B \u2032 )2 /4 \u2212 B \u2032\u2032 /2 = z 2 + 3/(4z 2 ).\n\n(8)\n\nwith the potential\n\n4\n\n\fNow the equation for \u03c8nv is exactly the same as in the original soft-wall model, and the\nregular solutions are:\n\u2212z 2 /2\n\n\u03c8nv (z) = e\n\nz 3/2\n\ns\n\n2\nL1 (z 2 ),\nn+1 n\n\n(9)\n\nwith Lm\nn the associated Laguerre polynomials and\nm2vn = 4(n + 1), n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n(10)\n\nOne can then use the experimental value for m\u03c1 to determine the parameter \u039b, which gives\n\u039b = m\u03c1 /2 \u2243 0.388GeV. The form of corresponding gauge fields reads\n\u2212z 2 2\n\nvn (z) = e\n\nz\n\ns\n\n2\nL1n (z 2 ).\nn+1\n\n(11)\n\n2\n\nAn extra exponential e\u2212z now appears in vn which forces it to vanish at the IR boundary,\nwhile in Ref. [2] vn diverges as z 2n+2 . The normalization condition is of the same form:\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ne\u2212\u03a6\nvm vn dz = \u03b4mn .\nz\n\n(12)\n\nOne can also find the non-normalizable solution to Eq. (7) at spacelike momentum\nq 2 < 0. This kind of solution can be separated into the source V\u03bc0 (q) and the bulk-toboundary propagator V (q, z) as V\u03bcT (q, z) = V (q, z)V\u03bc0 (q). The general solution for V (q, z)\nis given by\n2\n\nV (q, z) = A e\u2212z U(\n2\n\nAt large z, U( \u2212q4 , 0, z 2 ) \u223c (z 2 )q\n\n\u2212q 2\nq2\n2\n, 0, z 2 ) + B z 2 e\u2212z 1 F1 (1 \u2212 , 2, z 2 ).\n4\n4\n\n2 /4\n\nand 1 F1 (1 \u2212\n\nq2\n, 2, z 2 )\n4\n\n2\n\n\u223c ez (z 2 )\u22121\u2212q\n\n2 /4\n\n(13)\n\n. When q 2 < 0,\n\nthe second part of the solution diverges asz \u2192 \u221e, and thus should be discarded according\nto the standard \"regularity in the bulk\" condition [4]. Then A can be determined from the\nboundary condition V (q, 0) = 1 to be A = \u0393(1 \u2212 q 2 /4). From the solution of V (q, z), one\ncan derive the two-point function, which turns out to be\n2\n\n\u03a0V (q 2 ) =\n\nez V (q, z) \u2202z V (q, z)\ng52q 2\nz\n\nq2\n1\n= \u2212 2\u03c8 1 \u2212\n2g5\n4\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\nz=\u01eb\n\n2\ng52q 2\n\n+ Constant.\n\n(14)\n\nComparing to our previous result [10], an additional term \u2212 g22q2 appears, which seems to\n5\n\ncorrespond to a \"pion\" pole in the vector mode. This unphysical mode has already been\n5\n\n\fpointed out in the pioneer work of Karch et al [2]. It also affects the three point functions,\ne.g., the electromagnetic (EM) form factors of the vector mesons. Following the derivation\nin Ref. [11], one find that the EM form factors are given by\n2\n\nFnk (q ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ndz z 2\ne V (q, z) vn (z) vk (z) .\nz\n\n(15)\n\nAt q 2 = 0 the off-diagonal transitions do not vanish and the diagonal ones do not normalize\nto unity, which signal a violation of charge conservation.\n2\n\nThe underlying reason for all these is that, V (0, z) = e\u2212z is not a flat function as\nexpected. One may ask, if we can relax the IR boundary condition1 to make V (0, z) flat,\nat least approximately near the ultraviolet (UV) boundary? This sounds reasonable, since\nV (q, z) does not describe a physical state, or the physical vacuum. To this end, we retain\nthe IR divergent part in the general solution (13) with B a general function of q 2 . Since this\npart is sub-leading in the UV region, it does not affect the determination of the coefficient\nA. Now we calculate the correlation function again. In general there will be additional\ncontributions from the IR boundary, since now neither V (q, z) or its derivative vanishes\nthere. They are unwanted from the holographic point of view, and can be eliminated by\nadding suitable boundary terms. Then the correlation function can be derived to be:\n2\n\nez V (q, z) \u2202z V (q, z)\n\u03a0V (q ) =\ng52 q 2\nz\n2\n\n2\n\n=\u2212\n\nq\n1\n\u03c8 1\u2212\n2\n2g5\n4\n\n!\n\n+\n\nz=\u01eb\n\n2(B(q 2 ) \u2212 1)\n+ Constant.\ng52q 2\n\n(16)\n\nSo the IR divergent part contributes to the q 2 = 0 pole too. To eliminate this unphysical\npole, we are forced to choose B(0) = 1. Interestingly, with this choice V (0, z) becomes\n2\n\nV (0, z) = e\u2212z + z 2 e\u2212z\n\n2\n\n1 F1 (1, 2, z\n\n2\n\n) = 1,\n\n(17)\n\nand charge conservation is restored. Since now V (q, z) does not vanish at the IR boundary\nas the normalizable modes do, the decomposition formula [13] of V (q, z) does not exist\nany more. As a result, general vector meson dominance will be violated, and there will be\ndirect couplings of the external fields to the mesons. The complete form of V (q, z) and the\nphenomenological effects of it are still under investigation.\n1\n\nSuch kind of modification has once been investigated in Ref. [12].\n\n6\n\n\fC.\n\nAxial Sector\n\nThe fluctuations of the axial combination A = (AL \u2212 AR )/2 are a little complicated.\nThe axial field can be separated into the transverse and longitudinal parts as A\u03bc = A\u03bc\u22a5 +\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6, where \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bc\u22a5 = 0. The longitudinal part \u03c6 will get entangled with the pseudoscalar\nfluctuations, so we decay to talk about them in the next subsection. The transverse part,\nafter taking the axial gauge Az = 0, satisfies the equations:\n\"\n\n\u2202z\n\ne\u2212\u03a6\nq 2 e\u2212\u03a6 a g52 v(z)2 e\u2212\u03a6 a\n\u2202z Aa\u03bc +\nA\u03bc \u2212\nA\u03bc\nz\nz\nz3\n!\n\n#\n\n= 0,\n\n(18)\n\n\u22a5\n\nAgain one takes the Bogoliubov transformation to change them into the Schr\u00f6dinger form,\nand obtain the potential:\n\n3\ng52v(z)2\n+\n.\n4z 2\nz2\n\nVa (z) = z 2 +\n\n(19)\n\nFrom the IR behavior of v(z), the potential Va (z) can be expanded as:\ng52 v(z)2\n3\n+\n2\nz 2#\n\"4z\n2 2\n3 g 5 C2\nz \u22122 + O(z \u22124 ).\n+\n= z2 +\n4\n\u03c0\n\nVa (z) = z 2 +\n\n(20)\n\nThen we get the following spectrum approximately:\ns\n\nm2an \u2248 4n + 2 1 +\n\ng52 C22\n+2\n\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\nNotice that due to the nonzero quark condensate C2 , the vector and axial spectrum are\nnow split, with the leading order mass splitting independent of the excitation number n.\nThis is in contrast to the estimation in Ref. [1], where a constant behavior of X at large\nz was believed to introduce only a 1/n deformation of the axial masses and lead to chiral\nsymmetry restoration for highly-excited states. The asymptotic wave functions in the IR\nregion are\n\u2212z 2 m+1\n\nan (z) = e\nwhere m =\n\nq\n\n1+\n\ng52 C22\n.\n\u03c0\n\nz\n\ns\n\n2\n2\nLm\nn (z ),\nn+m\n\n(22)\n\nThese solutions can not be extended naively to the small-z region\n\nsince they have the wrong z \u2192 0 behavior for general m. To obtain the explicit solutions\nin the whole region one must employ numerical methods. It is also interesting to study the\nnon-normalizable mode. Because of the complicated form of v(z), this is more involved than\nthe vector one and we leave it to future work.\n7\n\n\fD.\n\n(Pseudo)Scalar sector\n\nNow we turn to the fluctuations around the scalar field X, and parameterizes X as\nX = (X0 + S)exp(i2\u03c0) as in Ref. [14] and Ref. [15]. The equation for S is easily derived\n[15]:\n\u2202z\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212\u03a6(z)\n1 \u2212\u03a6(z) a\na\n2 1 \u2212\u03a6(z)\n+\n3\ne\n\u2202\nS\ne\nS\n\u2212\nq\ne\nSa = 0 .\nz\n3\n5\n3\nz\nz\nz\n\u0013\n\n(23)\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger potential becomes Vs (z) = z 2 + 4z32 \u2212 2, and the corresponding spectrum is\n\ngiven by m2sn = 4n + 2. Comparing with the corresponding spectrum in Ref. [15], one see\nthat the deformation of the dilaton profile decreases the masses of the scalar mesons.\n\nFinally, the pseudoscalar fluctuations \u03c0 and the longitudinal part of the axial field satisfy\nthe coupled equations\n\n\u2202z\n\ng 2 v(z)2 e\u2212\u03a6 a\ne\u2212\u03a6\n\u2202z \u03c6a + 5\n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6a ) = 0 ,\n3\nz\nz\n!\n\n\u2212 q 2 \u2202z \u03c6a +\n\ng52 v(z)2\n\u2202z \u03c0 a = 0 ,\nz2\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nThese two equations can be combined [16] to give the decoupled form equation:\nh\n\ni\n\n\u2202z [\u0393(z) \u2202x y a] + \u0393(z) q 2 \u2212 \u03b2(z) y a = 0 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere y a \u2261 [e\u2212\u03a6(z) /z][\u2202z \u03c6a ], \u03b2(z) \u2261 g52 v(z)2 /z 2 and \u0393(z) \u2261 z/[\u03b2(z)e\u2212\u03a6(z) ]. One can then\nchange this equation into the Schr\u00f6dinger form with the Bogoliubov transformation y =\neB\u0303/2 \u1ef9 with\nB\u0303(z) = 2 log v(z) \u2212 \u03a6(z) \u2212 3 log z.\n\n(27)\n\nThe corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger potential becomes:\nVp =\n\nB\u0303 \u20322 B\u0303 \u2032\u2032 g52 v(z)2\n\u2212\n+\n.\n4\n2\nz2\n\n(28)\n\nBy using the asymptotic behavior of v(z) at large z, the potential can be expanded as:\nVp = z 2 + (\n\ng52C22 9 \u22122\n\u2212 ) z \u2212 4 + O(z \u22124 )\n\u03c0\n4\n\n(29)\n\nThen the spectrum is approximately given by\nm2pn \u2248 4n + 2\n8\n\ns\n\ng52C22\n\u2212 2 \u2212 2.\n\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\n\fSince the quark mass C1 does not appear, the lowest state must be massless. To satisfy this\ncondition, one must choose\n\ng52 C22\n\u03c0\n\n= 3 at this order, which then induces that m2pn \u2248 4n and\n\nm2an \u2248 4n + 6. However, when one further expand the potential to include higher powers of\nz \u22121 , variation of C2 is not enough to ensure that the lowest state be a massless state. This\n\nhas been confirmed by numerical calculation. It is interesting to study whether these higher\npowers can be eliminated by fine-tuning the detailed form of \u03a6(z) and the metric in the\nIR region. If this is true, we can always determine the quark condensate by requiring the\nlowest state being massless. A physical \u03c0 mass can then be obtained by taking the quark\nmass term as perturbation. Since all the normalizable modes are suppressed in the IR region\n2\n\nas z n e\u2212z , one can easily derive the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GOR) relation following the\nprocedure of Refs. [17, 18].\n\nIII.\n\nCOMMENTS ON THE CONFINEMENT PROPERTY OF THE MODEL\n\nTo explore the confining property of the background, one could compute the quarkantiquark potential through the prescription of Refs. [19, 20]. Namely one choose a rectangle\nloop C with one time direction, and calculate the expectation value of the Wilson loop from\nthe proper area of a fundamental string worldsheet ending on C at the boundary. When\na nontrivial dilaton is turned on, the generalization is not so straightforward. One way to\nimplement the dilaton was to work in the string frame rather than Einstein frame metric,\nas done in Ref. [21]. However, there are still some ambiguities in doing so due to the\ncomplicated worldsheet coupling to the background dilaton field 2 . To avoid this ambiguity,\nwe choose to consider some phenomenologically equivalent background in which the dilaton\nis trivial. In the vector sector, the soft-wall model can also be described by adding a warp\nfactor to the AdS metric [22]:\ngM N dxM dxN =\n\n\u0011\nA(z) \u0010\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n2\n,\n\u03b7\ndx\ndx\n\u2212\ndz\n\u03bc\u03bd\nz2\n\n(31)\n\nwith A(z) = e\u22122\u03a6 . Such kind of metric has been studied first in Ref. [23], but only as a\ndeformation of the hard-wall model. To calculate the quark-antiquark potential, one first\ndefines the following functions:\nf 2 (z) = \u2212g00 g\u03bc\u03bc\n2\n\nThanks Oleg Andreev for pointing out this to me.\n\n9\n\n\fg 2 (z) = \u2212g00 gzz\n\n(32)\n\nGenerally, the string worldsheet will not pass the point zm where f (z) has a minimum or g(z)\ndiverges. When the distance L between the quark and antiquark is large enough, most of\nthe worldsheet lies close to zm . This part gives the dominant contribution to the potential,\nE \u2248 f (zm )L. Thus confinement occurs if and only f (zm ) 6= 0, and the corresponding\n\nconfining tension is given by f (zm ) [8]. For the above metric, one has f (z) = g(z) = e\u22122\u03a6 /z 2 .\nThe criterion can only be fulfilled when \u03a6(z) goes to \u2212\u221e as z \u2192 \u221e. From this one easily\n\nconcludes that the original background with \u03a6(z) \u223c z 2 in Ref. [2] is not confining. For the\npresent choice \u03a6(z) = \u2212z 2 , f (z) has a nonzero minimum f (zm ) = 2e at zm =\n\n\u221a\n2\n,\n2\n\nleading to\n\na nonvanishing confining potential. The detailed calculation of the quark potential in such\na background confirms the above estimation [7]. At finite temperature, the deconfinement\nphase transition indeed happens and exhibits interesting properties, see, e.g., [24, 25].\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe properties of a \"soft-wall\" model with a negative dilaton are discussed. All the\nphysical fluctuations become regular in the infrared region after the modification. The\nvacuum solution of the field X, which is dual to the quark bilinear operator, tends to a\nconstant in the IR limit. This ensures the Regge behavior of the spectrum of the pseudoscalar\nand axial mesons. At the same time, this does not lead to chiral symmetry restoration for\nhighly-excited mesons. Under some assumptions, the value of the quark condensate can be\ndetermined by requiring the pion being massless in the chiral limit. We also point out that\nthe present choice for the dilaton leads to confinement, while that of the original soft-wall\nmodel does not. The unphysical pion mode in the vector channel seems to result from the\nimproper IR boundary condition. Once the boundary condition is relaxed, the unphysical\nstate can be eliminated.\n\nNote Added: While writing this paper, it was noted that Ref. [26] also proposes to\nmodify the sign of the dilaton in the soft-wall model to obtain confinement.\n\n10\n\n\fV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to thank Yi-hong Gao for very useful discussions, and Andreas Karch, Stanley\nBrodsky, Guy F. de Teramond, Elias Kiritsis, Oleg Andreev, Sergey Afonin for their helpful\ncomments and correspondences.\n\n[1] M.
