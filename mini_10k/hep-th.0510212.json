There are\nseveral arguments indicating that this is an exact symmetry of the full non-perturbative\ntheory (for reviews and original references see [1]).\nA remnant of T-duality is present at the level of the low-energy effective action, of the\nreduced theory, where all the massive string modes have been thrown away. It manifests\nitself as an ambiguity: Given the low-energy effective action, there are multiple, inequivalent ways of interpreting it as a reduction of a higher dimensional theory. Applying these\nambiguities to solutions of the reduced theory allows for solution-generating techniques.\nT-duality (and U-duality) however goes one step further, and claims that some of the\nsolutions related by these \"accidental\" symmetries actually are equivalent.\nThe (bosonic sector of the) dimensionally reduced low-energy action describes a theory\nof General relativity coupled to various form fields. One expects the appearance of symmetries that mix the directions over which one is reducing, but the theory may exhibit\nenhanced, previously \"hidden\" symmetries [2, 3, 4]. Such enhanced symmetries render\nthe assignment of a subgroup of \"geometrical\" symmetries ambiguous, and are therefore\na clear indication of the existence of dual formulations. They are however not an exclusive feature of the low-energy actions of string theories and M-theories; they occur in a\nmuch wider class of theories, of which many seem to have no direct relation with stringor M-theory [5, 6, 7, 8]. Most notable, among these theories are the \"bare\" theories of\nGeneral Relativity, as first discovered by Ehlers. A natural question is to what extent one\ncan make sense of these duality symmetries.\nA simple observation is that, if a theory of form fields is coupled to gravity, these exhibit pbrane solutions describing the gravitational back-reaction to some extended object (see [9]\nfor a pedagogical review and an extensive reference list). Compactifying such an extended\nobject on a torus of suitable dimension, one finds an effective theory describing strings,\nwhich possibly should exhibit T-dualities. This argument is admittedly very na\u0131\u0308ve, as it\nis well known that the higher dimensional action should also contain suitable couplings\nto dilatons and Chern-Simons terms if the reduced theory is to be regarded as a string\ntheory. Even if we fine-tune for these, the resulting theory will in general be a theory of\nwhich it is unclear whether there exists a consistent, non-perturbative quantum extension.\nWe will however ignore such questions and focus on necessary conditions for the presence\nof T-dualities from the classical theory. It will be clear then that non-linearly realized,\nenhanced symmetries and p-brane solutions are vital ingredients. This discussion even\napplies to (higher-dimensional) General Relativity, where there is at least one category\nof suitable solutions: The extremal Kaluza-Klein monopoles are for theories in 5 or more\ndimensions extended objects, and can be compactified to 5 dimensions to make string-like\nobjects.\n2\n\n\fAn interesting development was the application of T-duality to time-like circles [10, 11, 12].\nUnder such dualities, it is not at all guaranteed that a space-like circle gives rise to a\nspace-like circle in a dual picture, or that a time-like circle will dualize to a time-like\ncircle. In these circumstances the space-time signature is no longer a fixed quantity, but\nis dependent on the various dual points of view. Again these dual points of view should\nbe reflected in the symmetries of the low-energy effective action [13, 14, 11, 15].\nFor the ultimate unified point of view one would like to have a formulation with a symmetry that unifies all the possible space-like and time-like reductions, and the possible dualities. For the special situation where the reduction to 3-dimensions of the theory exhibits a\nnon-linearly realized symmetry G [5, 6, 7, 8], it has been proposed that candidate symmetry algebra's should contain a \"triple extended\" Lie algebra G+++ [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The\nextended algebra G+++ is built (with the standard rules [21]) from its Dynkin diagram,\nwhich is basically the Dynkin diagram of G extended with 3 more nodes. According to\nthe conjectures of [18, 19, 20], the degrees of freedom of the theory should be described\nby G+++ /K(G+++ ), where K(G+++ ) is generated by a sub-algebra of G+++ invariant\nunder a particular involution. The more conventional formulation of the theory should be\nretrieved by a kind of level-decomposition, where a \"gravitational sub-algebra\" is singled\nout.\nIt was soon realized that the space-time signature is encoded in (a subgroup of) K(G+++ )\n[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. It however turns out that the space-time signature in these theories\nis not fixed, but depends on the choice of gravitational sub-algebra [26]. Also outside the\nLorentz-subalgebra of K(G+++ ) there may be additional signs that should be reflected\nin the kinetic terms of the form fields [26]. This is actually the algebraic translation of\nthe time-like T-dualities that have subsequently been studied in this algebraic context\n[27, 28, 29].\nIn the present paper we would like to point out that there is one more aspect that should\nplay a role in the analysis. A priori it seems as if G+++ algebra's can accommodate for any\nspace-time signature and many possibilities for signs of the gauge-fields [26]. On second\nthought, this should be a cause of concern: In G+++ algebra's forms and their duals occur\nindependently, though the signs of forms and their duals should not be independent; and\ntheories with (anti-)self dual tensors can only exist in space-times of appropriate signature.\nBoth issues are related to Poincar\u00e9 duality, which is not, but should be implemented\nsomehow on these algebra's. In the present paper we find a simple criterion which as we\nwill prove implements Poincar\u00e9 duality correctly. The same ingredient is needed crucially\nto ensure the correct transformation properties of the theory under T-duality.\nIn section 2 we will collect the relevant facts on Poincar\u00e9 duality and T-duality. The\nallowed signature changes actually follow a very simple pattern that can be analyzed\nwithout any reference to G+++ algebra's or string theory. This is independent of, but\nshould be implemented correctly on the G+++ -algebra's. Section 3 recalls and explains\nwhy Weyl-reflections and other diagram automorphisms correspond to dualities. We\n3\n\n\fwill also sketch two, in our view, important complications in the treatment of G/H\nsigma models which restrict explicit computations, but can be avoided in an abstract\napproach. In section 4 we will briefly review the implementation of space-time signature\nand other signs in the context of G+++ -theories. Then we will derive a simple but universal\ncriterion that ensures that the theory has the correct transformation properties under\nPoincar\u00e9 duality. The criterion is formulated as a constraint on a quantity that is invariant\nunder Weyl reflections and outer automorphisms, and hence in one go restricts all dual\nformulations of the theory. For specific G+++ algebra's there is a larger class of such\ninvariants (though not necessarily invariant under outer automorphisms), for which we\ngive a construction recipe. Section 5 discusses the specific theories with their invariants.\nIn the concluding section 6 we will summarize and discuss our results.\n\n2\n\nDuality from dimensional reduction and oxidation\n\nThe aim of the present section is to give an intuitive feeling what the meaning of Tduality and in particular time-like T-duality is outside the context of string theory. For\nthis we will (ab-)use the low energy effective action. This section will be rather sketchy\nin nature, but we will not need much detail to derive precise statements about which\nsignature changes should be allowed.\n\n2.1\n\nSources of signs\n\nThe discussion that follows will be essentially one about minus signs. In the context of\ndimensional reduction and oxidation, such minus signs are essentially contributed by 3\nsources\n1. The space-time signature, that we will leave arbitrary unless indicated otherwise.\nThis assigns different signs to timelike and space-like directions in the Lorentzinvariant inner product. After fixing a space-time signature, the Lorentz-invariant\ninner product on the tangent space assigns definite signs to contractions of tensors.\nOur convention will be to assign to time-like directions a minus sign in the Lorentzinvariant inner product, and to space-like directions a plus sign.\n2. Explicit signs. The choice of space-time signature fixes the implicit signs present in\nthe contraction of field strengths for the various gauge fields to a Lorentz-invariant\ncombination, but not the overall sign. Though it is customary to choose a particular\nsign to avoid \"ghosts\" (unphysical modes) in quantum theory, we will leave also these\narbitrary unless indicated otherwise.\n4\n\n\f3. Poincar\u00e9 duality. The non-linear symmetries present in dimensionally reduced theories of General Relativity coupled to various form-fields, mix fields and their Poincar\u00e9\nduals. It is a simple exercise to derive that (in the absence of Chern-Simons terms\nand other complicating factors) [14]\nZ\nZ\nD\n2\nT \u22121\ndD x (F(D\u2212n) )2 .\n(1)\nd x (F(n) ) \u2192 (\u2212)\nHence if the number of time directions is even, either the form or its dual carries a\nkinetic term with the \"wrong\" sign. Another obvious but important point is that\nPoincar\u00e9 duality is consistent with dimensional reduction and oxidation. Reducing\nover timelike directions, the forms may obtain additional minus-signs, but then the\nnumber T also changes, and the Poincar\u00e9 duality relation remains intact under\ndimensional reduction.\nIn the dimensional reduction of a theory we find many form fields. Poincar\u00e9 duality\nimposes relations between the signs of these form fields, and in this way also restricts us\nin our possibilities in assigning signs to various form fields. After having fixed a space-time\nsignature and a definite sign for a form field, the sign for the dual form field is fixed. In the\nalgebraic approach to these theories using G+++ algebra's many signs cannot be chosen\narbitrarily because the algebraic relations relate them. It turns out however that this is\nnot the case for Poincar\u00e9 duality: This is not automatically built in in G+++ -algebra's,\nbut has to be imposed as a separate constraint. We will derive the precise form of the\nconstraint in section 4.\n\n2.2\n\nT-Duality\n\nFrom the effective field theory point of view, T-duality is a reinterpretation of the spectrum\nof scalar charges. Such charges couple to 1-form vector fields, so we focus on the sector\nof the effective field theory containing the 1-form vector fields.\nOne of the sectors contributing to the 1-form sector is the gravity-sector. We reduce\ne\nD-dimensional\ngeneral relativity to D dimensions, and allow for the possibility that the\ne\nn = D \u2212 D directions over which we are reducing may be timelike. The part of the\nLagrangian describing the Kaluza-Klein-vectors is\nLKK =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b7i fi (\u03c6k )\u22122 (F\u03bc\u03bd,i )2\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nDe symbols \u03b7i = \u00b11 indicate whether the direction corresponding to i was a time-like\n(\u03b7i = \u22121) or a space-like (\u03b7i = 1) one. The prefactor fi (\u03c6k ) depends on i and on the\ndilatonic scalars \u03c6k in the theory. We also define the overall signature of the reduced\n5\n\n\fdimensions \u03b7 (T is the number of time directions among the directions over which one is\nreducing)\nY\n\u03b7=\n\u03b7j = (\u2212)T .\n(3)\nj\n\nIn the most familiar reduction schemes [9, 6] (using \"upper triangular\" or \"Borel\" gauges)\nfi (\u03c6k ) is of the form exph\u03bbi , \u03c6i, but for reasons to be discussed later we will allow more\ngeneral forms. The F\u03bc\u03bd,i obey Bianchi identities of the form\ndFi = derivatives of scalars \u2227 Fj\n\n(4)\n\nAgain, the exact expressions are depending on the dimensional reduction scheme, but will\nnot be of much importance to us.\nEqually important, when given a sector in the theory with Lagrangian (2), then, under\nsuitable conditions, we can reinterpret it as representing reduction over a number of\ndirections with appropriate signature, a procedure that is known as oxidation.\nNow assume that the Lagrangian contains a second part, coming from the reduction of\nthe dynamics of a space-time (n + 1)-form C\u03bc1 ,...,\u03bcn+1 . We will generalize slightly, and\nactually allow for a multiplet of p such n + 1-forms. The reduction of such a p-plet of\nforms over n dimensions gives rise to another sector in the reduced theory with 1-forms,\nwith Lagrangian\np\nX\n\u03b8i gi (\u03c6k )\u22122 (G\u03bc\u03bd;i1 ...in ;i )2\n(5)\nLn = \u03b7\ni=1\n\nThe signs \u03b8i = \u00b11 are the signs appearing in front of the kinetic term for the C(n+1),i -field\nbefore reduction.\n\nProvided the gi and fi take similar forms (as they do in available dimensional reduction\nschemes), the Lagrangians (2) and (5) are similar in form. They arose from the reduction\nof a p-plet of n-forms over n-dimensions, coupled to gravity, but it is tempting to explore\nthe possibility that they can also be interpreted as coming from the reduction of an n-plet\nof p-forms, reduced over p dimensions. The signature of the dual theory is set by the p\nsigns \u03b7\u03b8i , while the n signs \u03b7i will appear in front of the kinetic terms for n p-forms. We\nalso note that the existence of an (n + 1)-form C\u03bc1 ,...,\u03bcn+1 coupled to gravity allows for an\nextremal n-brane solution. It is to be expected that the above duality exchanges a p-plet\nof n-branes in one theory, for an n-plet of p-branes in the other theory.\nAn immediate condition that has to be met for this reinterpretation, is the presence of\na subsector of the scalar sector that can be interpreted as an SL(n)/SO(n \u2212 q, q) \u00d7\nSL(p)/SO(p \u2212 r, r) sigma-model [3]. The SL(n)/SO(n \u2212 q, q) factor arises automatically\nin the reduction of the gravity sector, where q is the number of \u03b7i = \u22121 in (2), encoding\nthe number of time-like directions involved in the reduction. Similarly, r is the number\nof \u03b8i = \u22121 in (5). The condition on the presence of the relevant sigma models however is\n6\n\n\fonly a strong one if p > 1, because when p = 1 the SL(p) factor trivializes. The possible\npresence of enhanced symmetries is however a significant point. Further dimensional\nreduction will not destroy these enhanced symmetries, and hence they can be equally well\nstudied in theories that have been reduced further. In [7, 8] it was demonstrated how\nfrom enhanced symmetries in 3 dimensions the bosonic sector of the higher-dimensional\ntheory can be reconstructed; it turns out no additional conditions are needed.\nThese considerations give a potential duality between two, a priori different theories. In\ngeneral the two dual theories do not even live in a space-time of the same dimension. We\nshould stress however the \"a priori\": As we are focusing on a subsector of a theory to\nstart with, the dual description also involves only a sector of a theory and extending to\nthe full theory we may be studying different truncations of the same theory.\nWe illustrate these considerations with some familiar examples. The membrane of 11dimensional M-theory dualizes to a doublet of strings in a dual 10 dimensional theory; of\ncourse this is IIB -supergravity. We reduce on a 2 torus, that can be of signature (0,2)\nor (1,1). With signature (0,2) \u03b71 = \u03b72 = \u03b7 = \u03b8, and the dual theory has signature (1,9)\nwith two standard 2-form terms. With signature (1,1) we have \u03b7 = \u22121. Together with\nthe standard sign of the M-theory 3-form kinetic term, this means that we get a timelike direction back for the T 1,1 we have sacrificed, but the different signs of the \u03b7i imply\nthat the 2-form field kinetic terms have opposite signs [10, 11]. Also the other relations\nbetween M, M \u2032 , M \u2217 and IIB, IIB \u2032 , IIB \u2217 theories can be analyzed along these lines.\nA 3-brane in a space-time of signature (1, 9), as relevant to IIB-theory, but also to the\ntheory with conjectured E7+++ symmetry, dualizes to a triplet of strings in 8 dimensions.\nWith the various options for the signature, the space-time signature of the dual space is\nalways (1,7), but the 2-forms coupling to the strings have kinetic terms with signs (+ + +)\nor (\u2212 + +) depending on the choice of signature on the 3-torus. It is easy to see that\nthey are mixed by SL(3, R)/SO(3) respectively SL(3, R)/SO(1, 2). Notice that for IIBtheory, the invariance of the 3-brane under SL(2, R)/SO(2) implies that the dual strings\nshould be inert under the SL(2, R) factor in the SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(3, R) U-duality group in\n7 dimensions, as they are.\nAnother simple example is given by the doublet of 5-branes in IIB-theory. According\nto the above rules, they should give rise to a quintuplet of membranes in 7 dimensions,\ntransforming as a quintuplet under SL(5) and under SO(4, 1) or SO(5) [11, 15]. The\nM-theory 5-brane dualizes to the 5 strings in 7 dimensions that are the electro-magnetic\nduals to the membranes.\nAs a final cautionary remark we stress that one should verify that all necessary conditions\nare really met. As an absurd example of too naive analysis: 7-dimensional M-theory has\na decuplet of 3-branes, but this does not imply the existence of a triplet of 10 branes in\na 14-dimensional theory; there is no underlying SO(10)-symmetry.\n\n7\n\n\f2.3\n\nT-symmetry\n\nUpon invoking an extra dimension in the reduction, one can return to the original theory\nwithout returning to the original parameterization: First one reduces over n dimensions,\nand replaces these by the p dimensions of the dual system; with the extra circle we now\nhave p + 1 circles, from which we choose another set of p coordinates, and replace these\nby n coordinates of the original theory.\nFrom the effective field theory point of view, this involves the following Lagrangian. It is\nobtained by focusing on the subsector of 1-forms of the theory of D\u0303-dimensional General\nRelativity, coupled to an n-form, and reduced over n-dimensions.\np+1\nX\n\nL=\n\n\u03b7i fi (\u03c6)\u22122 (F\u03bc\u03bd,i )2\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b7i hi (\u03c6)\u22122 H\u03bc\u03bd,i\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\np+1\n\n+\u03b8G \u03b7\n\nX\ni=1\n\nwhere the F\u03bc\u03bd,i are the p + 1 field strengths corresponding to the Kaluza-Klein vector\nbosons, whereas the H\u03bc\u03bd,i = (p !)\u22121 \u03b5ii1 ...ip G\u03bc\u03bd,i1 ...ip correspond to the reduced form field\nmodes. The sign \u03b8G encodes the sign in front of the kinetic terms of the C-field before\nreduction, and\u0001 \u03b7 is again the product of the signs of the compact time-directions. As\nthere are p+1\n= p + 1 ways of reducing the form, there are just as many G\u03bc\u03bd,i as F\u03bc\u03bd,i .\np\nProvided suitable conditions on the fi and hi are met, there is a duality exchanging the\nF 's and the G's. The overall signature of the F 's and G's are exactly identical, up to an\noverall sign set by \u03b8G \u03b7. Hence, if \u03b8G \u03b7 = \u22121, the duality exchanging the F 's with the G's\nis a signature changing one. We conclude that the dual theory has\n\u03b7i\u2032 = \u03b7\u03b8G \u03b7i ;\n\np+1 p\n\u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b8G\n\u03b7 ;\n\np p+1\n\u2032\n\u03b8G\n= \u03b8G\n\u03b7 .\n\n(8)\n\nIt is a fact is that the existence of extremal p-brane solutions coupling to the G-fields\nrequires them to have a world volume signature \u2212\u03b8G : If \u03b8G = 1 then the number of\ntimelike directions incorporated will be 1 mod 2, whereas when \u03b8G = \u22121 the number of\ntimelike directions is 0 mod 2 [12]. Hence, if we choose \u03b7 to be in correspondence with the\nworld volume signature of extremal p-branes the above duality will always result in some\ndimensions changing signature. But this then immediately implies that the corresponding\np-brane can wrap the cycle over which we are reducing. In string theory it is often argued\nthat the fact that a brane can wrap a cycle softens the potential singularity that arises if\nsuch a cycle shrinks to zero size. It would of course be most interesting to study time-like\nT-duality for more complicated reductions to see if this is a property that is general.\nThe charges coupling to the F -fields are the momenta of gravitational waves, while the\ncharges of the G-fields are winding modes (where it is understood that momenta and\n8\n\n\fwinding can be space-like and time-like). The spacing of the momenta is small for large\nvolumes, while the spacing of winding modes is large (and vice versa for small volumes).\nAs the hypothetical duality interchanges these, we have a standard \"large volume-small\nvolume\" duality. For theories which are conjectured to be described by non-linear realizations of G+++ algebra's, exact formula's for the volumes can (in principle) be extracted\nwith the techniques used in [19].\nWith a little manipulation we see that\n\u2032\n\u03b8G\n= \u03b8G (\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 ).\n\n(9)\n\nThe kinetic term will therefore change sign if the number of compact time dimensions\nchanges from even to odd or vice-versa under the duality.\nAs illustrative examples we recall that 11-dimensional M-theory has a membrane solution\nwith world volume signature (T, S) = (1, 2). We then partition the space-time signature\n(1, 10) in a part corresponding to the membrane world volume and a transversal part, and\nT-dualize on a 3\u2013torus with signature (1, 2):\n(1, 10) = (1, 2) + (0, 8) \u2192 (2, 1) + (0, 8) = (2, 9)\n\n(10)\n\nUnder this duality the number of compact time-directions changes from 1 to 2, so we\nshould expect a sign change in front of the kinetic terms for the 3-form. M-theory also\nhas a 5-brane solution, with world volume signature (1, 5). Now the above duality applied\nto the 5-brane implies\n(1, 10) = (1, 5) + (0, 5) \u2192 (5, 1) + (0, 5) = (5, 6)\n\n(11)\n\nand the sign in front of the 6-form kinetic terms does not change (and, by Poincar\u00e9 duality,\nneither does the sign for the 3-form term).\nWe have to pay special attention to the situation in 4 dimensions, where the Kaluza-Klein\ngauge fields have duals that are also vector fields. We can set up the same Lagrangian,\nbut now G is essentially \u2217 F . If we ignore the complications caused by Chern-Simons\nterms, we could formally Poincar\u00e9 dualize, to derive that \u01ebG = (\u2212)T \u22121 , where T is now\nthe number of time directions in the non-compact directions. Hence a signature changing\nduality requires T to be even, that is 0, 2, 4. For General Relativity in signature (p, q) there\nexist extremal solutions of the form Rp\u22124,q \u00d7 T N 4,0 , Rp\u22122,q\u22122 \u00d7 T N 2,2 Rp\u22122,q\u22122 \u00d7 \u2212T N 2,2\nRp,q\u22124 \u00d7 T N 0,4 , with Ra,b flat space of signature (a, b), and T N a,b a Taub-NUT-solution\nof signature (a, b) [30, 12]. Again we are in the situation that for a signature changing\nduality we always have an extremal brane-solution that can wrap the compact directions.\nIn this case a signature changing duality gives dual signature\n(1, 10) = (1, 6) + (0, 4) \u2192 (6, 1) + (0, 4) = (6, 5)\n9\n\n(12)\n\n\fIt is tempting to speculate that the existence of M-theory variants with signature (9, 2)\nand (10, 1) is evidence for objects with 10 and 11 dimensional world volumes, but of\ncourse the present methods are not suitable for discussing these (dimensional reductions\nto 2 and 1 dimension would be needed, in which case we never would have vectors at our\ndisposal). A candidate 10-dimensional object (the \"M9\"\u2013brane) has appeared at various\nplaces in the literature.\n\n3\n\nSigma models and non-linear realizations\n\nIn the previous section we found suggestive dualities on the basis of an analysis of the\nspectrum of charges, that couple to vector-fields. Compactifying and reducing over an\nadditional dimension, the symmetries of the vector fields become reflected in the set of\nscalar fields in the theory. These typically form sigma-models on symmetric spaces of the\nform G/H, where G is a non-compact group, and H is a real form of the complexification\nof the maximal compact subgroup in G. As dualities from the effective field theory point\nof view are nothing but ambiguities in the oxidation procedure, we should now analyze\nthe oxidation of the sigma-model. Here we have powerful methods at our disposal, rooted\nin the representation theory of G. For finite dimensional G the oxidation procedure\nis mathematically rigorous [7, 8], for infinite dimensional G a level expansion gives the\ncorrect result at lower levels, but is not understood at higher levels [33, 18, 34, 20].\n\n3.1\n\nAmbiguities from oxidation of the scalar sector\n\nThe Lagrangian for a coset sigma model on G/H can be written in the following form\nZ\n1\ndd x Tr (F F \u2212 F \u03c9(F )) .\n(13)\n2\nHere F is the Lie(G)-valued (Lie(G) is the Lie-algebra of G), left-invariant one-form (of\nthe form V \u22121 (dV ) with V \u2208 G), and \u03c9 is the involution that leaves Lie(H) invariant. For\nnon-simple G the Lagrangian decomposes in several terms, each of which has the same\nstructure. For definiteness we will assume G to be simple in the following.\nIf G is finite-dimensional, then Tr(F F ) is the standard bilinear form on Lie(G) and\nhence positive definite. If in addition \u03c9 is a Cartan-involution, then by definition the\nbilinear form \u2212Tr(F \u03c9(F )) is positive definite [31], and hence the group structure does\nnot contribute minus signs to the Lagrangian. As \u03c9(h) = h for h \u2208 Lie(H), and the\ndefinition of Cartan involution implies that Tr(hh) = Tr(h\u03c9(h)) < 0 for h 6= 0, H will be\ncompact by Cartans first criterion. In all other cases, H is non-compact, and the trace\nTr over the group indices is not positive definite.\n10\n\n\fThe one-form F transforms as a connection under G transformations\nF \u2192 g \u22121F g + g \u22121 (dg),\nbut the Lagrangian is only invariant if g \u2208 H. Hence the theory is invariant under global Gtransformations V \u2192 gV (as these leave V \u22121 (dV ) invariant), and local H transformations\nV \u2192 V h(x), and describes a sigma-model on the coset G/H.\nThis form of the Lagrangian suffices for discussions in d-dimensions, but we actually need\nto relate this Lagrangian to higher dimensional theories. To make the link, one makes the\nfield-content of the Lagrangian visible in a two-step procedure.\nThe first step consists of fixing a way to represent Lie(G). This is necessary to do actual\ncomputations with the Lagrangian (13), and more particular, to specify the action of \u03c9.\nAs an example, one can describe an SL(p + q, R)/SO(p, q) by representing SL(p + q, R)\nby (p + q)-dimensional square matrices, and \u03c9 by \u03c9(F ) = \u2212\u03b7F T \u03b7, with \u03b7 an SO(p, q)\ninvariant metric and F T the matrix-transpose of F . However, such a representation is\nonly convenient if not only SO(p, q), but also SL(p + q, R) can be kept manifest in the\noxidation. To also be able to describe the cosets for arbitrary G, we need a general\nprescription. It is then more convenient to work with the adjoint representation. We will\nfix a triangular decomposition Lie(G) = H \u2295n\u2212 \u2295n+ , where H is a fully reducible abelian\nsubalgebra (a Cartan sub-algebra) and n\u00b1 are composed of ladder operators associated\nto positive, and negative roots respectively [21], and work with this.\nThe second step consists of (partially) fixing the H-invariance of the theory. Essentially\none is picking a set of variables to describe the coset G/H, after which (some) redundant\ncoordinates are eliminated, but also (part of the) H-invariance is no longer manifest. This\nsecond step is needed to relate to the outcome of some dimensional reduction procedure,\nor in the case of the conjectures relating to G++ and G+++ -algebra's [33, 18, 34, 20], to\nsome reconstruction algorithm. One can leave some, or even all of the H-invariance intact,\nprovided one relates to a formulation of the higher dimensional theory with manifest Hinvariance, and uses a dimensional reduction algorithm that respects these. One can for\nexample reduce a theory from D to D \u2032 \u2265 3 dimensions, while keeping the local SO(D\u2212D \u2032 )\ncovariance of the vielbein-formalism manifest. We also note the existence of formulations\nof maximally supersymmetric theories with local H-invariance [32].\nWe are emphasizing these two distinct steps, because when H is non-compact, and hence\nwhen time-like T-dualities are possible, there are subtleties concerning the second step,\nthe fixing of the H-invariance. But as H is a local (gauge) symmetry, nothing can depend\non the details of how we treat the H-invariance. We will nevertheless clarify the nature\nof the subtleties in our next subsection.\nFor the discussion of possible ambiguities in the interpretation of the subsector of the\nLagrangian (13) as coming from a higher dimensional theory, we only need to discuss\nLie(G). A first ambiguity arises because we have to fix a \"gravitational subalgebra\"\n11\n\n\fof the form An , and there may be multiple non-equivalent embeddings (not related by\nconjugation with group elements) of these. This results in general in higher dimensional\ntheories with different matter content, and lies at the heart of the algebraic description\nof T-duality.\nWithin a class of equivalent embeddings there are still ambiguities. The triangular decomposition is not invariant under the action of G, but there is a discrete subgroup of\nG, effectively the lift to G of the Weyl group of Lie(G), that normalizes the Cartan subalgebra, and also n+ \u2295 n\u2212 , the set of ladder operators. It therefore permutes the fields\nassociated to particular (combinations of) generators, and the oxidation of the theory to\nhigher dimensions is ambiguous because of these permutations. This is what has been\ncalled T-symmetry.\nWe note that, apart from the Weyl group, outer automorphisms of the algebra permuting\nthe vectors of the root lattice will also result in ambiguities in the oxidation. These result\nhowever in gravitational sub-algebra's that are not conjugate (as the automorphism is\nouter) and hence this belongs to T-duality.\nEven if part of the G-symmetry is kept, similar arguments apply. For example, in the\nexample sketched in the above where SL(p + q, R) (and SO(p, q)) is kept, this group acts\n(in the fundamental, respectively vector- representation) on some carrier space for the\nrepresentation. The assumption that this space is a (p + q)-torus, makes backgrounds\nrelated by SL(p + q, R)-transformations inequivalent, but there is a subgroup of SL(p +\nq, R) with a rather trivial action: it only permutes the basis-elements of the carrier space.\nThis permutation action is generated by the Weyl group of SL(p, q), and hence we are\nback in the previous situation.\n\n3.2\n\nSubtleties\n\nFor cosets G/H where H is non-compact, there are a number of subtleties compared to\nthe case where H is compact. We will highlight two issues that may seem confusing, but\nshould not distract the reader from the main point. We think however that especially the\nfirst point deserves more attention than it has received thus far.\n3.2.1\n\nThe Borel gauge is a \"bad\" gauge for non-compact H\n\nIn the dimensionally reduced theories sigma-models on symmetric spaces make their appearance. These symmetric spaces are of the form G/H, with G a non-compact Lie-group.\nFor the cases where the dimensional reduction/compactification includes only space-like\ncircles, the group H = Hc is the maximal compact subgroup of G; in the case time-like\ndirections are included the compact group Hc has to be replaced by a non-compact Hnc\nwith the same complexification as Hc .\n12\n\n\fFor the sake of concreteness, we will work with G that are split real forms, though all\nremarks generalize to G's in other non-compact real forms. The Lie algebra LG associated\nto G allows a triangular decomposition in terms of a Cartan-subalgebra with generators\nhi , and raising/lowering operators e\u03b1 . The compact subgroup H is now generated by\ngenerators of the form e\u03b1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1 .\nThis description of the group H makes a very explicit use of the triangular decomposition.\nIt allows the well-known action of the Weyl group on G, that will automatically act on\nH.\nTo describe the coset G/H, one chooses a single representative of each orbit of H on G. In\nphysical language, this amounts to fixing the gauge. If we then act with the Weyl group\non G/H the gauge that we have chosen is typically not respected. Because the sigmamodel is invariant under the left action of H one can allow for an H-transformation that\nrestores the gauge. The combination of a Weyl-reflection together with its gauge-restoring\nH-transformation then gives the symmetry transformation of various fields.\nThe most popular gauge-choice is the so-called Borel gauge, which relies on the Iwasawadecomposition. The Iwasawa decomposition theorem states that any element g of a noncompact group G can be written as\ng =k*a*n\n\n(14)\n\nwhere k is an element of the maximal compact subgroup in G, a is an element of the\nAbelian group obtained by exponentiating (a subset of) the generators of the Cartansubalgebra (generating non-compact symmetries), and n an element of a unipotent group.\nIn the special case that G is a so-called split real form, the elements a come from exponentiating all of the Cartan-subalgebra, and the elements n are obtained by exponentiating\nelements from the step-generators associated to positive roots.\nIt is clear that this decomposition is of a great value for the description of cosets G/H\nwhere H is the maximal compact subgroup of G. In that case the elements of G/H can\nbe written as\n!\n\u0010X\n\u0011\nX\nC\u03b1 e\u03b1 ,\n(15)\ng = exp\n\u03c6i hi exp\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\n\u2206+ being the set of positive roots. In this gauge the action of H, generated by the\nalgebra-elements e\u03b1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1 is completely fixed. A caveat in the application of the Iwasawa\ndecomposition theorem is, in the context of the applications discussed here, that it is\nproven for finite-dimensional G only. The crucial thing to establish is that any element\nof G can be written as in the decomposition, and it seems that this needs the relation\nbetween the Lie-algebra, and Lie-group, which is not well understood for general (not\nnecessarily finite-dimensional) Kac-Moody algebra's. It is however generally assumed\nthat an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Iwasawa decomposition exists [33].\n13\n\n\fMore relevant in the situations of interest to us is that H is not always compact. It was\nobserved in [14] that the relevant H is always a real form of the complexification of the\nmaximal compact subgroup H, but that it is not necessarily the compact real form. These\nforms can be described by replacing some of the antihermitian generators e\u03b1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1 by\nhermitian generators e\u03b1 + e\u2212\u03b1 [22, 23, 24, 25]. Demanding closure of the algebra leads to\ntools that allow to classify the relevant possible denominator subgroups [15].\nBy replacing a compact H by a non-compact one, we are however outside the scope of\nthe Iwasawa decomposition theorem. If one nevertheless insist on the usage of elements of\nthe form (15) we have to pay a price: Of course these elements are contained in the coset,\nbut the reverse is no longer true, not every element in the coset can be written in the\nform (15). This can be immediately seen in examples, but also directly. The coset G/H,\nwhere H is not a maximal compact subgroup, must contain compact cycles (because there\nmust be compact orbits in G that cannot be compensated with H-transformations). But\nthe ranges of the variables in (15) are non-compact, and consequently, the variables (15)\ndescribe only an open proper subset of G/H.\nThe prototype example is found in the space SL(2, R)/SO(1, 1). The Borel gauge essentially amounts to the \"upper triangular gauge\"; elements in this gauge have the lower left\nentry set to zero. Consider now the element\n\u0012\n\u0013\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6\n\u2208 SL(2, R)\n(16)\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\nIf we try to bring this to upper triangular form by multiplying on the left by an element\nof SO(1, 1), it requires essentially solving the equation\ntan \u03c6 = \u00b1 tanh \u03c9\n\n(17)\n\nfor some \u03c9. But it is immediately clear that this cannot have solutions when | tan \u03c6| \u2265 1.\nThis is in a nutshell the problem for any compact cycle in G/H.\nOf course one can define the set S of elements k * a * n for all k, a, n, with k \u2208 H. This set\nS is in general not a group, because it will not close under group multiplication. Instead\nS is a proper subset of G. Hence the set of all representatives a * n will only cover part of\nG/H. Whether this is a serious problem depends on the application we have in mind. We\nargued that T-dualities are generated by a discrete set of transformations on G. Now if we\nstart with S instead of G, then the image of S under such transformations is generically\nnot contained in S. In explicit language, the transformation that brings us back to our\ngauge choice does not exist! Hence in the end we can only do an analysis on\n\\\nImw (S)\n(18)\nw\u2208W\n\nwhere W contains all the transformations (Weyl reflections, outer automorphisms) we are\ninterested in. For an extension to all of G/H one has to rely on some sort of continuation\n14\n\n\fprocedure. It would be much simpler to not rely on the Borel gauge for this kind of\ncomputation at all, but it seems however that a general \"good gauge choice\" (a gauge\nthat can always be imposed) is unavailable even for finite-dimensional G/H, not even\nmentioning infinite-dimensional G's 1 . Luckily, as far as T-dualities are concerned, we do\nnot need to rely on any gauge choice.\nMoreover, we will argue later that in the context of G+++ algebra's the use of compact\nsubgroups in the coset construction is inconsistent with Poincar\u00e9 duality. But then the\nBorel gauge, used throughout the literature thus far, misses part of the compact cycles\nin G+++ /K(G+++ ), and there are as a matter of fact infinitely many independent such\ncycles if K(G+++ ) is not compact!\n3.2.2\n\nThe action is not invariant under the Weyl-group\n\nA less important problem, which may nevertheless be confusing is the fact that the action\n(13) is generically not invariant under the transformations we are considering. This can\nbe seen easily already if we restrict to those duality transformations that are generated by\nWeyl reflections. These can be implemented by conjugation with an element W , acting\nas\nW exp gW \u22121 = exp w(g)\ng \u2208 Lie(G)\n(19)\nThe element W is an element of the maximal compact subgroup in G. In the action (13)\nthe one form F transforms as F \u2192 W F W \u22121. The action is then invariant if\n\u03c9W (F ) \u2261 \u03c9(W F W \u22121) = W \u03c9(F )W \u22121\n\n\u2200W, F\n\n(20)\n\nWe may analyze this equation as follows: To every element g of the algebra there is a one\nparameter-subgroup of G given by exp tg. The Lie algebra homomorphism \u03c9 lifts to a\ngroup homomorphism \u03a9 by defining \u03a9(exp tg) = exp(t\u03c9(g)). Though not every element\nof G can be written as exp tg, any element can be written as a product of such elements,\nand then the homomorphism property guarantees that \u03a9 can be extended to the whole\ngroup. We then compute\ne\u03c9(W F W\n\n\u22121 )\n\n= \u03a9(eW F W ) = \u03a9(W eF W \u22121 ) = \u03a9(W )e\u03c9(F ) \u03a9(W \u22121 )\n\u22121\n\nThe condition (20) can then be rewritten to\n\u0001\n\u0001\nW \u22121 \u03a9(W ) e\u03c9(F ) = e\u03c9(F ) W \u22121 \u03a9(W )\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\n1\n\nGood gauge choices are known in specific situations. For example one can prove that for\nSL(2, R)/SO(1, 1), with the SL(2, R) elements written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\n,\na, b, c, d \u2208 R, ad \u2212 bc = 1,\nc d\nthe gauge condition ac + bd = 0 can always be established. But we are unaware of a general, good (and\nuseful !) gauge fixing procedure for general G/H.\n\n15\n\n\fBecause this has to valid for any F , this implies that W \u22121 \u03a9(W ) is proportional to the\nidentity (by Schurs Lemma). This is trivially the case if \u03a9(W ) = W , that is if W \u2208 H.\nHowever W is in the maximal compact subgroup of G, and this does not coincide with\nH if H is non-compact. Because W is in the compact subgroup of G, we could also have\nW \u22121 \u03a9(W ) = \u03bb, with \u03bb a phase , but this is generically not the case. So for non-compact\nH, the action is generically not invariant under Weyl-reflections.\nThis should not confuse the reader. It will be clear that also \u03c9W (F ) defines a formulation\nof the sigma-model on G/H. Different \u03c9W do not in any way affect G, but only change\nthe way we embed H in G. In view of the ambiguities we are interested in, we should not\nview models defined by different \u03c9W (F ) as different models, but as different realizations\nof the same model. If one could encode \u03c9 in a way that would not rely on a specific basis\nfor the algebra or a specific realization, one might avoid the changes in the Lagrangian\nunder Weyl reflections; such invariant Lagrangians appear not to have been constructed,\nand it is not even clear (to the author) that they exist.\n\n4\n\nG+++ algebra's: General theory\n\nWe now explicitly turn to G+++ -algebra's. The present section is devoted to G+++ algebra's in general, in the next section we will do computations with explicit G+++\nalgebra's.\n\n4.1\n\nDefining G+++ and K(G+++)\n\nThe G+++ -algebra's are essentially defined by their Dynkin diagrams. The Dynkin diagram for a simple group G consists of n nodes, where n is the rank, which we label by\nan integer i ranging from 1 to n. To this diagram we add three more nodes, labelled by\n0, \u22121 and \u22122. The node labeled by 0 is connected to the Dynkin diagram to obtain the\nextended Dynkin diagram, also known as the Dynkin diagram of the untwisted affine Lie\nalgebra G+ associated to G. We then connect the node labeled by \u22121 with a single line to\nthe node 0, to obtain the diagram of the overextension or canonical hyperbolical extension\nG++ of G. Finally, the node \u22122 is connected by a single line to the node \u22121 to obtain\nthe diagram of the triple extended algebra G+++ . Via this node by node extension, there\nis a natural embedding\nG+++ \u2283 G++ \u2283 G+ \u2283 G\n(23)\nWe will make use of some results for G+ and G later.\nFrom this diagram the Cartan matrix A = (aij ), with i, j in the index set I \u2261 {0, 1, . . . 10},\nmay be reconstructed by the standard procedure [21]. The construction of the algebra\nG+++ starts by choosing a real vector space H of dimension n+3 and linearly independent\n16\n\n\f\u2228\nsets \u03a0 = {\u03b1\u22122 , . . . , \u03b1n } \u2282 H\u2217 (with H\u2217 the space dual to H) and \u03a0\u2228 = {\u03b1\u22122\n, . . . , \u03b1n\u2228 } \u2282 H,\nobeying \u03b1j (\u03b1i\u2228 ) = aij . The \u03b1i are called the simple roots of G+++ , and \u03b1i\u2228 are the\nassociated simple coroots.\n\nFrom the Cartan matrix the algebra G+++ can be constructed. The generators of the\nalgebra consist of n + 3 basis elements hi of the Cartan sub algebra H together with\n22 generators e\u03b1i and e\u2212\u03b1i (i \u2208 I), and of algebra elements obtained by taking multiple commutators of these. These mutual commutators are restricted by the algebraic\nrelations:\n[hi , hj ] = 0\n\n[hi , e\u03b1j ] = \u03b1j (hi )e\u03b1j\n\n[hi , f\u2212\u03b1j ] = \u2212\u03b1j (hi )e\u2212\u03b1j\n\n[e\u03b1i , e\u2212\u03b1j ] = \u03b4ij \u03b1i\u2228hi ;\n(24)\n\nand the Serre relations\nad(e\u03b1i )1\u2212aij e\u03b1j = 0\n\nad(e\u2212\u03b1i )1\u2212aij e\u2212\u03b1j = 0\n\n(25)\n\nThere is the root space decomposition with respect to the Cartan subalgebra, G+++ =\n\u2295\u03b1\u2208H\u2217 g\u03b1 , with\ng\u03b1 = {x \u2208 G+++ : [h, x] = \u03b1(h)x \u2200 h \u2208 H}\n(26)\nThe set of roots of the algebra, \u2206, are defined by\n\u2206 = {\u03b1 \u2208 H : g\u03b1 6= 0, \u03b1 6= 0}\n\n(27)\n\nThe root lattice P (G+++ ) consists of all linear combinations of roots with integer coefficients. The roots of the algebra form a subset of the root lattice \u2206 \u2282 P . We will denote\nthe generators of g\u03b1 by ek\u03b1 , where k is a degeneracy index, taking into account that the\ndimension of g\u03b1 may be bigger than 1. If dim(g\u03b1 ) = 1, we will drop the degeneracy\nindex, and write e\u03b1 for the generator. This in accordance with previous notation, as\ndim(g\u03b1i ) = 1 for \u03b1i a simple root. By using the Jacobi identity, one can easily prove that\n[ei\u03b1 , ej\u03b2 ] \u2208 g\u03b1+\u03b2 , if this commutator is different from zero.\nA particular real form of the G+++ algebra is the split real form. The Lie-algebra of\nthe split real form consists of linear combinations of the generators constructed thus far\nwith real coefficients. Almost all of the present literature on G+++ algebra's is devoted\nto split real forms. Other real forms can be constructed by defining realizations for the\nCartan involution. It is easy to see that for 3 dimensional coset sigma models involving\nnon-compact real forms of G (see [8] for an exhaustive list) there exist corresponding\nG+++ algebra's defined by extending the Satake-Tits diagram in the obvious way. We\nwill however also restrict mostly to split real forms.\nUsing the standard bilinear form on the root space [21] we define the simple coweights\n(which are elements of H) by\nh\u03b1i , \u03c9j i = \u03b4ij .\n(28)\n17\n\n\fThe coweight lattice, which we call Q(G+++ ) consists of linear combinations of the fundamental coweights with coefficients in Z, and is the lattice dual to the root lattice P (G+++ ).\nThe Weyl group W (G+++ ) of G+++ is the group generated by the Weyl reflections in the\nsimple roots\nh\u03b1i , \u03b2i\n\u03b1i\n(29)\nwi (\u03b2) = \u03b2 \u2212 2\nh\u03b1i , \u03b1i i\nThe Weyl group leaves the inner product invariant\nw \u2208 W (G+++ )\n\nhw(\u03b1), w(\u03b2)i = h\u03b1, \u03b2i\n\n(30)\n\nIn [26, 15] we demonstrated that the closure of the group K(G+++ ) demands that the\nhermiticity properties of its generators can be conveniently encoded in an element f \u2208\nQ(G+++ ). The group K(G+++ ) is then generated by the generators\nek\u03b2 \u2212 ei\u03c0h\u03b2,f i ek\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u2208 G+++\n\n(31)\n\nFrom the definitions it is straightforward to derive that f and f +2q define the same group\nfor q \u2208 Q(G+++ ). As a consequence f can be expanded in the fundamental coweights as\nf=\n\nn\nX\n\npi \u03c9 i ,\n\npi \u2208 Z2 = {0, 1}\n\n(32)\n\ni=\u22122\n\nThese definitions reduce the characterization of the real form of the infinite-dimensional\ngroup K(G+++ ) to the specification of the n + 3 Z2 -valued coefficients pi .\nThe coset G+++ /K(G+++ ) encodes the properties of a class of physical theories, along\nwith all their reductions and oxidations. To recover the field content of a D-dimensional\ntheory one chooses a regular gravitational subalgebra SL(D, R) and decomposes under\nthis algebra. The representation content at lower levels consist of the gravitational sector,\na scalar sector transforming under the centralizer of SL(D, R) in G+++ , and a bunch of\nform fields, the higher levels are not understood [33, 18, 34, 20].\nThe space-time signature in turn is encoded in how the SL(D, R) intersects with G+++ , as\nits intersection is the algebra so(p, D \u2212 p) [26]. This so(p, D \u2212 p) algebra at level 0 implies\nthat the form fields at higher levels transform as so(p, D \u2212 p)-tensors. There is however\nthe possibility of additional signs (because G+++ is strictly bigger that so(p, D \u2212p)) which\nwas interpreted in [26] as a consequence of the freedom to multiply the kinetic terms of\nthe tensor fields with additional signs.\nWe have argued thus far that Poincar\u00e9 duality restricts us in our ability to add signs to\nthe algebra in a consistent way. In the next section we will derive how the restrictions\nfrom Poincar\u00e9 duality should be consistently built in into the above framework.\n18\n\n\f4.2\n\nPoincar\u00e9 duality and the i0 criterion\n\nAt first it may seem that for general G+++ we can only do computations on a case-by-case\nbasis, as the matter content depends sensitively on the algebra. All of theories described\nby G+++ algebra's however have a universal feature: if reduced to 3 dimensions, they\ndescribe a scalar sigma model with global G symmetry. The duals to the axionic scalars\nare vectors in 3 dimensions, which should also transform under G. These matter fields\ncan be recovered from the decomposition relevant for 3 dimensions:\nG+++ \u2192 SL(3) \u00d7 G.\n\n(33)\n\nThis decomposition automatically implies a level expansion, where \"level\" is defined with\nrespect to the \u03b10 -node. It is relatively easy to verify that the first two levels with respect\nto this decomposition contain the representations\nlevel\n0\n1\n\nsl(3) \u2295 G irrep\n(8, 1) \u2295 (1, dim(G))\n(3, dim(G))\n\n(34)\n\nThe interpretation of the matter spectrum is straightforward. At level 0 the (8, 1) is the\nadjoint of SL(3), which in turn is part of the GL(3) of 3-dimensional General Relativity;\nthese are singlets with respect to G. The irrep (1, dim(G)) however forms a singlet under\nthe SL(3) of General Relativity, hence these are scalars, and there are dim(G) of them,\nenough to fill the adjoint of G2 . The first level consists of vectors (the 3-dimensional irrep\nof SL(3)), formally dual to the axions of the scalar sector, and hence also transforming\nin the adjoint of G.\nHence, on the levels 0 and 1, we have 4 copies of the root system of G, a singlet of\nSL(3, R) at level 0 for the scalar sector, and a triplet of SL(3) at level 1, for the vectors.\nIf we denote by \u03b1H the highest root of G, embedded in the obvious way in the G+++ root\nsystem (by identifying \u03b1i with i > 0 as the simple roots of G), the corresponding roots\ncan be written as\nlevel\n0\n1\n\nG+++ -roots\n0\n\u00b1 positive\n\u03b10 + \u03b1H\n\u00b1 positive\n\u03b1\u22121 + \u03b10 + \u03b1H\n\u00b1 positive\n\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b1\u22121 + \u03b10 + \u03b1H \u00b1 positive\n\nroots\nroots\nroots\nroots\n\nof\nof\nof\nof\n\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\n(35)\n\nNow we turn back to the physical 3-dimensional theory. If the space-time signature of the\n3-dimensional space-time is (+ + +) (3 spatial dimensions) then the overall signs of the 3\n2\n\nWhen fixing a gauge, almost half of these are eliminated. Remember however that we have chosen\nnot to fix the gauge.\n\n19\n\n\fcomponents of the vector should be (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212); Poincar\u00e9 duality requires an overall minus\nsign in front of the vector. If the space-time signature is (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212) (3 time-dimensions),\nthen the signs again have to be (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212), because now Poincar\u00e9 duality tells us that there\nis no extra sign for an odd number of time dimensions. Similarly, for signature (\u2212 + +)\nthe vector has (\u2212 + +) while for signature (\u2212 \u2212 +) the vector has (+ + \u2212). Summarizing,\nthe number of relative minus signs appearing in the vector is always odd, regardless of\nthe signature.\nWe can read off the relative signs for the vector from the algebra, by computing:\nh\u03b10 + \u03b1H , f imod 2,\n\nh\u03b1\u22121 + \u03b10 + \u03b1H , f imod 2,\n\nh\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b1\u22121 + \u03b10 + \u03b1H , f imod 2 (36)\n\nWe have just derived that Poincar\u00e9 duality requires that there is an odd number of minus\nsigns among these 3 signs. This can be easily checked by summing the 3 relative signs\nmodulo 2. We should therefore demand the following\nConsistency criterion: The function f specifies a K(G+++ ) consistent with Poincar\u00e9\nduality if and only if\ni0 (f ) \u2261 h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b1H , f i mod 2 = 1.\n\n(37)\n\nWith this criterion, the signs of the vector become\nh\u03b1\u22122 , f i + 1 mod 2;\n\nh\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b1\u22121 , f i + 1 mod 2;\n\nh\u03b1\u22121 , f i + 1 mod 2.\n\n(38)\n\nAs the Lorentz group is encoded in the generators as\ne\u03b2 \u2212 exp i\u03c0h\u03b2, f ie\u2212\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b2 = \u03b1\u22121 , \u03b1\u22122 , \u03b1\u22121 + \u03b1\u22122 ,\n\n(39)\n\nit is straightforward to check that the requirement (37) is sufficient to obtain the right\nsigns.\nThe derivation of the criterion was done for the 3-dimensional theory. We noted however\nthat Poincar\u00e9 duality is consistent with reduction and oxidation, which are automatically\nimplemented in the algebra. The criterion (37) should therefore be the correct criterion\nin any dimension for space-time, even though it is much less straightforward to derive it\nfor the more general case.\nThe above expression for i0 (f ) is a universal one, but when we wish to apply it to a\nspecific G+++ algebra, we need the, algebra dependent, expression for \u03b1H . For any G \u03b1H\nis the so-called \"highest root\", and allows an expansion in the simple roots as\nr\nX\nai \u03b1i\n(40)\n\u03b1H =\ni=1\n\nThe integer numbers ai are known as the root integers, and because of the mod 2 nature\nof the i0 criterion, we only need their values modulo 2. The reader can find them for\nexample in [21], table Aff 1 in chapter 4. Later we will discuss the separate G+++ algebra's\nexplicitly, and give the explicit expressions for i0 (f ) for all the cases.\n20\n\n\f4.3\n\nProperties of i0\n\nThe quantity i0 (f ) enjoys the following two important properties\ni0 (f ) = i0 (w(f ))\ni0 (f ) = i0 (f + 2q)\n\n\u2200w \u2208 W (G+++ );\n\u2200q \u2208 Q(G+++ ).\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nWe will call i0 (f ) a \"mod 2 index\" of K(G+++ ). Although i0 (f ) is formulated in terms\nof f , the above statements indicate that i0 not so much characterizes f , but rather the\nequivalence classes of f under the Weyl group and shifts over twice the coweight lattice.\nThese transformations do not alter K(G+++ ), but only its embedding in G+++ , and in\nthat sense i0 is a quantity that contains information on K(G+++ ). We will now prove the\ninvariance statements (41) and (42).\nThe statement (41) states that i0 (f ) takes the same values on f 's related by Weylreflections. It is convenient to use the orthogonality properties of the Weyl reflections\nwith respect to the bilinear form\nh\u03b2, w(f )i = hw \u22121 (\u03b2), f i\n\n(43)\n\nWe then prove (41) as follows: \u03b10 + \u03b1H is an imaginary root of G+ . Imaginary roots of\naffine Kac-Moody algebra's are all null |\u03b10 + \u03b1H | = 0 [21], and orthogonal to any real root\nof the algebra, which in this case are the roots \u03b10 , . . . , \u03b1r . Together with the fact that\ninspection of the Dynkin diagram teaches us that \u03b1\u22122 is orthogonal to \u03b10 , . . . , \u03b1r (by the\ndefining properties of the Dynkin diagram), this shows that (37) is invariant under Weyl\nreflections in \u03b10 , . . . , \u03b1r . It remains to check for the Weyl reflections in \u03b1\u22121 and \u03b1\u22122 . On\nthe basis of elementary roots these have the following effect:\nw\u03b1\u22121 : \u03b1\u22122 \u2192 \u03b12 + \u03b1\u22121 ; \u03b1\u22121 \u2192 \u03b1\u22121 ;\n\u03b10 \u2192 \u03b10 + \u03b1\u22121 ;\nw\u03b1\u22122 : \u03b1\u22122 \u2192 \u2212\u03b12 ;\n\u03b1\u22121 \u2192 \u03b1\u22121 + \u03b1\u22122 ;\n\n(44)\n\nand roots that are not listed remain invariant. It is immediately verified that w\u03b1\u22121 and\nw\u03b1\u22121 also leave i0 (f ) invariant, hence all generators of the Weyl group leave i0 (f ) invariant.\nThis last statement implies that any element of the Weyl group leaves i0 (f ) invariant.\nIf the diagram of G+++ admits a diagram automorphism, the algebra of G+++ admits an\nouter automorphism (that actually is an extension of the outer automorphism of G). In\nthe cases where these appear (A+++\n, Dn+++ , E6+++ ), it can be verified (see the explicit\nn\nexpressions given later) that the index i0 (f ) is not only invariant under the Weyl group,\nbut also under the outer automorphism. In essence this can be directly traced to the fact\nthat the set of root integers ai is invariant under outer automorphisms [21].\nThe second statement, that i0 (f ) takes the same value on f and f + 2Q(G+++ ) follows\ntrivially from the mod 2 property of i0 (f ) and the definition of Q.\n21\n\n\fThese properties are crucial for the consistency of the framework. We have claimed\nthat Weyl reflections and outer automorphisms in the G+++ algebra correspond to a\nkind of duality group, acting on the physical theories constructed from the algebra, and\nthat theories not satisfying the i0 -criterion are incompatible with Poincar\u00e9 duality. It is\nimportant then that Weyl reflections should respect Poincar\u00e9 duality. The properties we\nhave just verified ensure that they indeed do.\nAn immediate consequence of the criterion (37) is that it is inconsistent with the use of\nf = 0, that is with a \"compact\" subalgebra. This means that within this framework,\neven if we decided to work with Euclidean theories, we will always encounter minus signs\nand hence non-compact denominator subgroups! Also Wick rotations must be performed\nwith care, it seems that at least for some applications we should demand consistency with\nthe i0 criterion. Then, although the denominator subgroup K(G+++ ) can be altered by\nsuch a procedure, we can never change it to the compact algebra. Of course this could\nhave been anticipated: For a Euclidean theory reduced to 3 dimensions, Poincar\u00e9 duality\nimplies that there should be a relative minus sign between 3-dimensional scalars and the\ndual vectors, as has been known for long [35].\nFor theories in which (anti-)self-dual tensors occur, we have to require specific signatures\nfor space-time. If we do not, there is a set of tensors in the level decomposition of the\nG+++ - algebra that does not have duals (namely the would-be self-dual tensors that\ncannot be self-dual because it is inconsistent with the space-time signature). Imposing\nthe i0 criterion, Poincar\u00e9 duality is implemented correctly, and this problem cannot occur.\nWe will check later in explicit examples that everything works out as it should.\n\n4.4\n\nOther \"mod 2 indices\"\n\nThe existence of the Weyl-invariant index i0 (f ) immediately evokes the question: Do there\nexist other mod 2, Weyl-invariant quantities? It is clear that if they do, these could be\nused to distinguish between the various orbits of the Weyl group, and extract information\non the theory without fixing a level decomposition.\nIt seems there are no further general indices of the type of i0 (f ), but a survey among\nspecific G+++ algebra's will show that some of them admit other indices. It also turns\nout that though they do distinguish between the orbits of the Weyl groups, they are not\n\"fine enough\" in the sense that it is not possible to tell every orbit apart from others by\ncomparing these \"indices\".\nThe requirement of invariance under shifts by 2QG+++ is automatically built in if we use\nthe following ansatz for a \"mod 2 index\":\ni(f ) = h\n\nr\nX\n\npi \u03b1i , f imod 2\n\ni=\u22122\n\n22\n\npi \u2208 Z\n\n(45)\n\n\fThe mod 2 property implies that we can restrict pi to the values 0, 1 of the additive group\nZ2 .\nThe question is now which combinations of pi make i(f ) invariant under Weyl-reflections.\nA trivial solution consists of setting all pi = 0, and the existence of i0 (f ) demonstrates\nthat there is a non-trivial solution. An easy way to construct all non-trivial indices goes\nas follows. One can encode a candidate i(f ) by writing the Dynkin diagram of G+++ , and\nlabel all nodes i with the number pi . The action of a Weyl reflection in the simple root\nlabeled by node i can be computed to be\nX\nX\nh\u03b1j , \u03b1k i\npk )\u03b1j\n(46)\np j \u03b1j ) =\n(pj \u2212 2\nwi (\nh\u03b1j , \u03b1j i\nj\nj\nAs we will be computing modulo 2, the only property of the Cartan matrix we are interested in is whether its entries are odd or even. We can then summarize the effect of a\nWeyl reflection in the following prescription: The effect of wi is to add a multiple of the\nvalue of pi to the pk of the nodes adjacent (connected by lines) to i. If the line connecting\nthe nodes i and k is single or triple, then pi has to be added to pk . If the line is a double\nline, then pi has to be added to pk if |\u03b1i | > |\u03b1k |, but not otherwise. In graphical language:\nFor double lines the value of pk can only go along double lines in the direction of the\narrow.\n\nHence under Weyl reflections, each pk receives contributions from the adjacent nodes.\nInvariance under Weyl reflections implies choosing the pk such that all the contributions\nfrom adjacent nodes cancel out. An immediate consequence is for example that if the\ndiagram has a chain with an endpoint (all the G+++ Dynkin diagrams have at least one\nsuch endpoint), that the node adjacent to the endpoint must have pi = 0. For chains of\nsingle lines with endpoint this implies that every second node must have pi . After these\npreliminary considerations it is easy to solve for the remaining pi .\nWe should note however that if i(f ) and j(f ) are indices in the above sense, that then\nalso (i + j)(f ) is an index. Hence, when enumerating all the indices, we can restrict to a\nset of linearly independent indices.\nFor these indices we have not built in the invariance under outer automorphisms, and\nindeed, for the Dn+++ algebra's there exist indices that are not invariant under these, and\nhence not under T-duality. We will exhibit specific indices for specific G+++ algebra's\nlater.\n\n5\n\nG+++ algebra's: explicit computations\n\nWe will now illustrate the general findings of the previous section, and fill in the details\nof their application to specific G+++ -algebra's. We will recover and extend the results of\n[28]. First however we derive a simple result that will be highly useful later.\n23\n\n\f5.1\n\nAn index for SL(2n, R) algebra's\n\nThe following result turns out to be very useful. It is essentially formulated in terms of\na \"mod 2\" index for SL(2n, R) algebra; it is useful because in many instances one can\nidentify a contribution of this sort to an index of a G+++ algebra.\nLemma: Consider the algebra SL(2n, R), which has as its Dynkin diagram a straight\nline connecting 2n \u2212 1 nodes. We number its nodes 1, . . . , 2n \u2212 1 from one end to the\nother. Consider an element f \u2208 QA2n\u22121 and compute\nI=h\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c92i\u22121 , f i mod 2\n\n(47)\n\ni=1\n\nThe generators e\u03b1 \u2212 exp(i\u03c0h\u03b1, f ie\u2212\u03b1 generate SO(p, 2n \u2212 p) where p is odd if I = 1, and\np is even when I = 0.\nThis can be proven quickly when we use an observation from [15]. There it was noted,\nthat for an AD\u22121 = SL(D, R) algebra, with a function f written as\nf = \u03c9k1 + \u03c9k2 + . . . + \u03c9kn\n\nk1 > k2 > . . . > kn ,\n\n(48)\n\nf defines the denominator subgroup SO(k, D \u2212 k) with k described by an alternating sum\nof the ki\nn\nX\nk=\n(\u2212)i+1 ki\n(49)\ni=1\n\nWe note that when computing modulo 2, p = 2n \u2212 p. Computing (49) modulo 2, one can\nimmediately omit the signs (\u2212)i+1 and then also skip all the even ki . But then it is easy\nto see that\n(I = k = p) mod 2\n(50)\nThis lemma is useful because among the G+++ algebra's there are many instances where\none can identify a contribution of the form I in i0 (f ). If this contribution corresponds\nto a gravitational subalgebra, then I distinguishes between the space-time signature\n(even, even) and (odd, odd). These space-time signatures admit (anti-)self dual forms\nwith n-form field strength when n mod 2 = I. More precisely if (n + I) mod 2 = 0, then\nthe square of the Hodge-star \u2217 2 = 1; if (n + I)mod 2 = 1 then the square of the Hodge\nstar \u2217 2 = \u22121. When there are n-forms transforming in some representation of an internal symmetry group, then these representations have to be real, respectively complex,\notherwise they cannot obey a relation of the form\n\u2217F(n) = \u00b1F(n)\n\n(51)\n\nIn relevant situations, this reality or complexity of representations is implied in the i0 (f )\ncondition.\n24\n\n\f5.2\n\nSimply-laced split G+++ algebra's\n\nWe now demonstrate a number of explicit computations. We will first discuss the simply\nlaced G+++ algebra's. As the gravity sub-algebra consists entirely of long roots, which\ncan never mix with short roots under diagram automorphisms and under Weyl reflections,\nthese are to some extent the most representative for the T-duality pattern. Moreover, in\nmany aspects the non-simply laced and non-split algebra's can be viewed as an extension\nof the simply laced algebra's. Correspondingly, the theories based on non-simply-laced and\nnon-split algebra's are extension of theories based on simply laced algebra's, by including\nextra matter sectors.\n5.2.1\n\nA+++\nalgebra's: General Relativity in various dimensions\nn\n\n+++\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nn\n-2\n\n-1\n\nA1\n\n+++\n\nAn\n\n0\n1\n\nFigure 1: Dynkin diagrams of the triple extended A-algebra's.\nThe A+++\nalgebra is conjectured to describe symmetries of General Relativity, formulated\nn\nin D = n + 3 dimensions.\nThe highest root of the An algebra is given by\nn\nX\n\u03b1H =\n\u03b1i\n\n(52)\n\ni=1\n\nThe consistency criterion for the index i0 (f ) hence takes the explicit form\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b1i , f i mod2 = 1\n\n(53)\n\ni=1\n\nThe A+++\n-algebra's with n > 1 allow a diagram automorphism, whose action consists\nn\nof exchanging \u03b1i with \u03b1n+1\u2212i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. The index i0 remains invariant under this\nautomorphism.\n25\n\n\fOmitting the \u03b1n node and all links to it leads to the Dynkin diagram of SL(D), which\nis supposed to describe the simple part of the GL(D) relevant to the vielbein. After\nembedding the space-time signature in this SL(D)-algebra, the i0 condition fixes the\nremaining sign, so apart from the space-time signature there are no adjustable signs.\nFor n is odd (General Relativity in even dimensions), there is an extra index:\n(n\u22121)/2\n\ni1 (f ) = h\n\nX\n\n\u03b12k+1 , f i mod 2\n\n(54)\n\nk=0\n\nIts meaning is easier described in terms of the index i0 (f ) + i1 (f ). With the \u03b1n node\nomitted, this index is of the form I we have used in the lemma in subsection 5.1. Hence\nwe can link the values of i0 +i1 to the space-time signature. However, consistency requires\nthat i0 (f ) = 1 always, and hence i0 (f ) + i1 (f ) = i1 (f ) + 1. So we have i1 (f ) = 1 if the\nspace-time signature (t, s) = (even, even), and i1 (f ) = 0 for (t, s) = (odd, odd).\nWe can see immediately that 4-dimensional General Relativity, governed by A+++\ndoes\n1\nnot allow signature changing dualities. This is proven in two steps: one first notes that\nWeyl reflections in \u03b1i (i = 1, 2, 3) do not affect the space-time signature (as they only\npermute directions); the Weyl reflection in \u03b14 can alter the f -function by integer multiples\nof 2\u03b14 \u2208 2Q(A+++\n), but this does not affect the space-time signature, which is a mod 2\n1\ncomputation. The impossibility to perform a time-like T-duality could also have been\nanticipated from our physical interpretation: For general relativity T-duality has to be\ngenerated by Kaluza-Klein-monopoles. But for 4-dimensional General Relativity these\nare not extended objects, so there cannot be any relation via \"string-dualities\".\nFor higher dimensional General Relativity, we can immediately check time-like dualities\nby embedding the space-time signature in an appropriate way.\nWe start with considering the signature (0, D). The requirement i0 (f ) = 1 implies that\nthe right real form of the K(A+++\n) algebra must be a non-compact form given by:\nn\nf = \u03c9n\n\n(55)\n\nWeyl reflecting in \u03b1n and reducing modulo 2 results in\nf = \u03c90 + \u03c9n\u22121 + \u03c9n .\n\n(56)\n\nThis is easily seen to represent signature (D \u2212 4, 4), and hence reproduces the naive\nargument of section 2. It is amusing to note that this computation even applies for\nD = 4; the formula's are predicting that this theory does not transform under timelike\nT-duality. The signature (p, D \u2212 p) can be implemented by (if 1 < p \u2264 n \u2212 1 = D \u2212 4)\nf = \u03c90 + \u03c9p + \u03c9n\n26\n\n(57)\n\n\fWeyl reflecting in \u03b1n leads to\nf = \u03c9p + \u03c9n\u22121 + \u03c9n\n\n(58)\n\nThis represents signature (D \u2212 4 \u2212 p, p + 4), which agrees with the derivation in section\n2. Note that this duality becomes impossible if p > D \u2212 4.\nIf 2 \u2264 p \u2264 D \u2212 2 = n + 1 we can also embed the (p, D \u2212 p) by using\nf = \u03c9\u22122 + \u03c9p\u22122 + \u03c9n\n\n(59)\n\nNow the Weyl reflection in \u03b1n leads to\nf = \u03c9\u22122 + \u03c90 + \u03c9p\u22122 + \u03c9n\u22121 + \u03c9n\n\n(60)\n\nwhich represents space-time signature (D \u2212 p, p).\nCollecting all the possible orbits under time-like T-duality, we obtain the following table,\nwhich is valid for D \u2265 7:\nD mod 4\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n(t mod 4, s mod 4)\n(0, 0)\n(1, 3) \u2194 (3, 1)\n(2, 2)\n(0, 1) \u2194 (1, 0)\n(2, 3) \u2194 (3, 2)\n(0, 2) \u2194 (2, 0)\n(1, 1)\n(3, 3)\n(0, 3) \u2194 (3, 0)\n(1, 2) \u2194 (2, 1)\n\n(61)\n\nWe have required D \u2265 7 because for D = 4, 5, 6 some of these orbits break up due to the\nabsence of the relevant duality operation. For D = 4 timelike T-dualities are impossible,\nas explained previously. For the dimensions D = 5, 6 the orbits are\nD\n5\n\n6\n\n(t, s)\n(0, 5) \u2194 (1, 4)\n(2, 3) \u2194 (3, 2)\n(4, 1) \u2194 (5, 0)\n(0, 6) \u2194 (4, 2) \u2194 (2, 4) \u2194 (6, 0)\n(1, 5)\n(3, 3)\n(5, 1)\n\n(62)\n\nThese orbits (some of which can also be found in [28]) of the gravitational algebra are\nof importance because any G+++ algebra has a A+++\nalgebra as subalgebra. For any of\nn\n27\n\n\fthese theories the signatures listed here should be connected by duality transformations.\nThe only issue may be whether some of these orbits may get connected due to additional\nsymmetries.\n5.2.2\n\nDn+++ -algebra's: String theories in various dimensions\n\n+++\n\nD4\n3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n+++\n\nDn\n\nn\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nn-1\n\n1\n\nn-3\n\nn-2\n\nFigure 2: Dynkin diagrams of the triple extended D-algebra's.\nThe Dn+++ algebra's (with n \u2265 4) are conjectured to represent bosonic string theory in\nD = n + 2 dimensions.\nThe highest root of a Dn algebra reads\n\u03b1H =\n\nn\u22123\nX\n\n2\u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\nThe i0 criterion reads:\n\n!\n\n+ \u03b1n\u22122 + \u03b1n\u22121 + \u03b1n\n\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b1n\u22122 + \u03b1n\u22121 + \u03b1n , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(63)\n\n(64)\n\nThe Dn+++ algebra's always have multiple indices. There is always the second index\ni1 (f ) = h\u03b1n\u22122 + \u03b1n\u22121 , f i mod 2\n\n(65)\n\nMoreover for n > 4 and even there is a third independent index\nn/2\u22122\n\ni2 (f ) = h\n\nX\n\n\u03b12k + \u03b1n\u22121 + \u03b1n , f i mod 2\n\nk=1\n\n28\n\n(66)\n\n\fThe Dn+++ algebra's with n > 4 allow a diagram automorphism that is inherited from the\nDn algebra. It exchanges the nodes \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n\u22122 . Hence it leaves i0 and i1 invariant,\nbut it exchanges i2 with i1 + i2 .\nThe D4+++ algebra has a highly symmetric diagram, and has apart from i0 (f ) the indices\ni1 (f ) = h\u03b12 + \u03b13 , f i\n\ni2 (f ) = h\u03b12 + \u03b14 , f i mod 2\n\n(67)\n\nThe algebra D4+++ allows an even bigger set of automorphisms, inherited from the triality\nof D4 : Any permutation of \u03b12 , \u03b13 and \u03b14 corresponds to an admissible automorphism.\nAll of these leave i0 invariant, but they permute i1 , i2 and i1 + i2 .\nIn the theory with maximal dimension D = n+ 2, the SL(D) chain representing gravity is\nformed by the nodes \u03b1\u22122 , . . . , \u03b1n\u22122 . It is also possible to form a D-dimensional theory by\ninstead using the chain \u03b1\u22122 , . . . , \u03b1n\u22123 , \u03b1n\u22121. This formulation is related to the previous one\nby an outer automorphism of Dn+++ , or equivalently, the two are related by a T-duality.\nWhichever way we choose to embed the chain, there are two nodes not included. For\nconcreteness, we choose these to be \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n . The i0 (f ) condition fixes the product of\ntheir signs, but we can choose one sign independently. Physically, these nodes correspond\nto a 2-form in the maximal dimension (\u03b1n\u22121 ), and a D \u2212 4-form (\u03b1n ), that is the Poincar\u00e9\ndual to the 2-form. Poincar\u00e9 duality tells us their signs should be related, and indeed, so\ndoes its algebraic counterpart, the i0 condition. The index i1 (f ) incorporates the sign of\nthe 2-form, but not of the (D \u2212 4)-form, and hence is an interesting quantity if we wish\nto keep track of the signs. If we specify the space-time signature and i1 (f ) the signs of\nthe theory are essentially fixed. We note also that the roots corresponding to the \"dual of\nthe graviton\" are at higher levels, but that essentially its sign is the product of the signs\nof the 2-form with the sign of the (D \u2212 4)-form.\nIn Euclidean signature (0,D) we have the two possibilities\nf = \u03c9n\u22121 \u2194 i1 (f ) = 1\n\nor\n\nf = \u03c9n \u2194 i1 (f ) = 0\n\n(68)\n\nThe option f = \u03c9n\u22121 allows a Weyl-reflection in the \u03b1n\u22121 (string-)node, resulting in the\nsignature (2, D \u2212 2). Weyl reflections in the node \u03b1n (the (D \u2212 5)-brane node) have no\nsignature changing effect. Note that with these conventions the 2-form kinetic term has\na minus sign, and hence allows extremal string solutions of world volume signature (0, 2).\nThat implies however that the (D \u2212 4)-form field term has the conventional sign, so a\n(D \u2212 5) brane must have an odd number of time directions on its world volume, which is\nimpossible.\nFor the choice f = \u03c9n the roles are reversed: Now the kinetic term for the 2-form has a\nplus-sign and the (D \u2212 4)-form a minus-sign, implying the existence of a (D \u2212 5)-brane\nbut absence of a string. Now a signature changing duality induced by a Weyl reflection\nin the node \u03b1n is possible, resulting in the signature (D \u2212 4, 4).\n29\n\n\fWe now turn to the signatures (p, D \u2212 p) 1 \u2264 p \u2264 D \u2212 3 = n \u2212 4, and with i1 (f ) = 0. We\nset\nf = \u03c9n\u22123 + \u03c9n\u22122 + \u03c9n\u22121 ,\n(69)\nfor p = 1, and\nf = \u03c9n\u22122\u2212p + \u03c9n\u22123 + \u03c9n\u22122 + \u03c9n\u22121 + q\u03c9n ,\n\n(70)\n\nfor 1 < p \u2264 n \u2212 4 = D \u2212 3, where q can be adjusted to make i0 (f ) = 1. Weyl reflecting in\nthe string node \u03b1n\u22121 amounts to the disappearing of \u03c9n\u22123 from the above expressions. This\nhowever does not have any effect on the signature. This is because the relevant theories\nall have a conventional sign in front of the 2-form, implying a string with world-volume of\nsignature (1, 1). The rules we outlined in section 2 then imply that the overall space-time\nsignature cannot change under reflections in these nodes. Note also that i1 (f ) = 0 implies\nthe same for the T-dual theory, the one where we interchange the roles of \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n\u22122 .\nThe theory with p = 1 has the standard Minkowski signature, and here we can generate\ntime-like T-dualities only with the 5-brane node (and hence time-like T-duality must be\ninvisible in CFT [36]). To study duality in the 5-brane node we set (1 \u2264 p < n\u22124 = D\u22126)\nf = \u03c91 + \u03c9p+1 + \u03c9n\n\n(71)\n\nThese theories also have signature (p, D \u2212 p) and i1 (f ) = 1, and it is not hard to show\nthat they are connected to the previous theories by permutation of the coordinates (Weyl\nreflections in nodes other than \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n ). A Weyl reflection in \u03b1n will result in\nf = \u03c9p+1 + \u03c9n\n\n(72)\n\nrepresenting signature (D \u2212 p \u2212 4, p + 4). This is generated by a reflection corresponding\nto a (D \u2212 4)-brane with world volume signature (p, D \u2212 p \u2212 4):\n(p, D \u2212 p) = (p, D \u2212 p \u2212 4) + (0, 4) \u2192 (D \u2212 p \u2212 4, p) + (0, 4) = (D \u2212 p \u2212 4, p + 4) (73)\nThe (D \u2212 4)-brane solutions with these world volume signatures ought to exist provided\nthe sign in front of the corresponding kinetic term is (\u2212)p+1 , which of course perfectly\ncorrelates with our claim that the 2-form terms had a plus-sign for their kinetic terms.\nThe other subcases correspond to i1 (f ) = 1. To study duality in the node (n \u2212 1) we set\nf = \u03c9n\u22123\u2212p + \u03c9n\u22123 + \u03c9n\u22121 + q\u03c9n\n\n(74)\n\nwhere again q should be set to 0 or 1 to fulfill the i0 -condition. These represent space-time\nsignatures (p, D \u2212 p) with 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n \u2212 1 = D \u2212 3. A Weyl reflection in the node \u03b1n\u22121\nleads to\nf = \u03c9n\u22123\u2212p + \u03c9n\u22121 + q\u03c9n\n(75)\n30\n\n\fwhich represents the space-time signature (p + 2, D \u2212 p + 2). This is consistent with the\ninterpretation of the theory as one with wrong signed 2-form term, which implies string\nsolutions with world-volume signature (2, 0) and (0, 2).\nTo study duality in the (D \u2212 5)-brane node when i1 (f ) = 1 we set\nf = \u03c90 + \u03c9p + \u03c9n\u22121 + \u03c9n\n\n(76)\n\nwith 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n \u2212 3 = D \u2212 5. This represents signature (p, D \u2212 p). Reflecting in \u03b1n leads\nto\nf = \u03c90 + \u03c91 + \u03c9p + \u03c9n\u22121 + \u03c9n\n(77)\nwhich represents the signature (D \u2212 p \u2212 2, p + 2). This implies there is a (D \u2212 5)-brane\nwith world volume signature (p \u2212 1, D \u2212 p \u2212 3), meaning that the sign for the kinetic\nterms of the (D \u2212 6)-form is (\u2212)p , perfectly consistent with our claim that the theories\nwith i1 (f ) have a wrong signed kinetic term for the 2-form.\nThere are many other signature changes possible, that we will not exhibit explicitly.\nThe theories conjectured to be described by Dn+++ algebra's allow another interesting\noxidation branch, leading to 6 dimensional theories (see [7]. The gravitational subalgebra is now the one corresponding to the nodes \u03b1\u22122 , \u03b1\u22121 , \u03b10 , \u03b11 and \u03b1n . The space-time\nsignature is then governed by i0 (f ) + i1 (f ), if this is 1 then the signature is (odd, odd),\nif it is 0 then the signature is (even, even). With the constraint i0 (f ) = 1, this implies that the space-time signature fixes i1 (f ). The reason for this is that the theory\nadmits 3-form field strengths, that should be subjected to a (anti-)self-duality constraint.\nFor 6 dimensional space-time signature (even, even) the eigenvalues of the Hodge star\nare imaginary, and i1 (f ) = 1. One can verify, using the techniques of [15] (see also\nthe appendix of this paper), that this implies that the 6 dimensional coset symmetry is\nSO(n \u2212 3, n \u2212 3)/SO(n \u2212 3, C), such that the representation of the 3-forms are indeed\ncomplex valued. In contrast, when i1 (f ) = 0, and the space-time signature is (odd, odd),\nthe coset is of the form SO(n \u2212 3, n \u2212 3)/SO(n \u2212 3 \u2212 p, p) \u00d7 SO(n \u2212 3 \u2212 p, p), and the\nrepresentations to which the 3-forms belong is real.\n5.2.3\n\nE6+++ : Membranes in 8 dimensions\n\nTo the E6+++ -algebra corresponds an 8 dimensional theory that has a doublet of 3-forms.\nThis doublet transforms under SL(2)/SO(2) or SL(2)/SO(1, 1), depending on the choice\nof various signs.\nThe highest root of the E6 algebra is\n\u03b1H = 2\u03b11 + 3\u03b12 + 2\u03b13 + \u03b14 + 2\u03b15 + \u03b16\n\n(78)\n\nThe E6+++ -algebra only has one index\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b12 + \u03b14 + \u03b16 , f i mod 2 = 1\n31\n\n(79)\n\n\f-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n+++\n\nE6\n\n2\n\n+++\n\nE7\n\n7\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n+++\n\nE8\n\n8\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 3: Dynkin diagrams of the triple extended E-algebra's.\n\nThe i0 -condition then tells us that if the signature of the 8-dimensional space-time is\n(odd, odd), that the coset must be of the form SL(2), R)/SO(2), while when the signature\nis (even, even) the coset has to be SL(2)/SO(1, 1). This correlates perfectly with Poincar\u00e9\nduality: In signature (odd, odd) the eigenvalues of the duality operation are \u00b1i, and the\n3-form and its dual combine in a complex combination, rotated into one another by\nSO(2) \u223c\n= U(1). In signature (even, even) however the eigenvalues of Hodge-star are \u00b11,\nwhich is consistent with the fact that the SO(1, 1) algebra is real.\nNote that according to our rules, a doublet of 3-forms in 8 dimensions gives rise to a\ndoublet of membranes, which gives rise to a dual theory with a doublet of membranes. Of\ncourse the dual theory is related to the original one by the outer automorphism of E6+++ .\nThe analysis of the dual theory is identical to that for the original theory, due to the fact\nthat i0 (f ) is invariant.\nOnce we have chosen a space-time signature, the i0 condition tells us whether the 8dimensional coset is SL(2, R)/SO(2) or SL(2, R)/SO(1, 1). If it is SL(2, R)/SO(2), we\nstill have some freedom in choosing consistent signs. The 8-dimensional theory has a\ndoublet of 3-forms (coupling to membranes), and the kinetic term for this doublet can\nhave either a plus or minus sign. This sign is encoded in a contribution of \u03c95 to f . In\nthe case the coset is SL(2, R)/SO(1, 1) the doublet has 1 plus and 1 minus sign, and\nthe relative sign can be changed by a SL(2, R)/SO(1, 1) transformation, so there are no\n32\n\n\fadditional signs to be adjusted.\nA detailed analysis of the possible signature and how they connect under duality transformations/Weyl reflections gives the following two orbits:\n(1, 7, +),\n(0, 8),\n\n(2, 6),\n\n(1, 7, \u2212),\n\n(3, 5, +),\n\n(3, 5, \u2212),\n\n(5, 3, +),\n\n(4, 4),\n\n(6, 2),\n\n(5, 3, \u2212),\n\n(7, 1, +).\n\n(7, 1, \u2212),\n\n(8, 0);\n\n(80)\n(81)\n\nBecause only in the case where the space-time signature is (odd, odd) there are unspecified\nsigns, we have added to these signatures a + or \u2212 indicating whether the 3-form kinetic\nterms come with conventional (+) or unconventional sign. The first of these orbits is also\ndiscussed in [28], where another notation for the signs is used.\n5.2.4\n\nE7+++ : 3-branes in 10-dimensions; or strings in 8-dimensions\n\nThe highest root of the E7 algebra is given by\n\u03b1H = 2\u03b11 + 3\u03b12 + 4\u03b13 + 3\u03b14 + 2\u03b15 + \u03b16 + 2\u03b17\n\n(82)\n\nThe i0 (f ) index for E7+++ then reads\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b12 + \u03b14 + \u03b16 , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(83)\n\nA second index is given by\ni1 (f ) = h\u03b14 + \u03b16 + \u03b17 , f i mod 2.\n\n(84)\n\nThe E7+++ -algebra leads to a 10-dimensional theory with a self-dual 4-form3 . Self-duality\nis only consistent with signature (odd, odd), but then any sign for the kinetic terms for the\n3-form is possible. This is indeed exactly the content of the i0 -condition for this theory.\nOnce we fix the space-time signature, the sign of the 4-form kinetic term is encoded in\ni1 . From this we can learn that once the sign is fixed to plus or minus, there does not\nexist a time-like T-duality to a 10 dimensional theory where the 4-form kinetic term has\nopposite sign.\nThe 3-brane coupling to the 4-form in 10 dimensions, dualizes to a triplet of strings\ncoupling to 2-forms in 8 dimensions. Indeed, by choosing the SL(8)-chain running from\nthe \u03b1\u22122 node to the \u03b17 node, we find this second, dual theory. The indices for these\ntheory are easier discussed if we first look at the index i0 + i1 . It is easy to see that if\n3\n\nIn many references this theory is not oxidized beyond 9 dimensions, but the existence of the 10dimensional version is well-known [6, 7]. A simple way to construct the theory is by starting with the\nbosonic sector of type IIB theory, and then omitting the scalar sector and truncating further to the fields\nthat are singlets under SO(2)/SO(1, 1).\n\n33\n\n\fi0 + i1 = 1 (which, because i0 = 1 corresponds to i1 = 0), this corresponds to space-time\nsignature (odd, odd) for the 8-dimensional theory, while i0 + i1 = 0 (i1 = 1) corresponds\nto space-time signature (even, even).\nThe 10-dimensional theories are connected in the following way under time-like T-dualities.\nWe indicate a \u2212 if the value of i1 = 1 and a + if i1 = 0. Then the orbits are\n(3, 7, \u2212) \u2194 (7, 3, \u2212)\n\n(85)\n\n(1, 9, \u2212) \u2194 (5, 5, \u2212) \u2194 (9, 1, \u2212)\n\n(86)\n\nAll of these theories have 8-dimensional duals that have space-time signature (even, even).\nThe more conventional theories have i1 (f ) = 0, and can all be dualized into each other,\nthat is the signatures\n(1, 9, +),\n\n(3, 7, +),\n\n(5, 5, +),\n\n(7, 3, +),\n\n(9, 1, +),\n\n(87)\n\nare all connected. Because of i1 (f ) = 0, these must dualize to 8-dimensional theories with\nspace-time signature (odd, odd).\n5.2.5\n\nE8+++ : M-theory and IIB-string theory\n\nIn [26] the possible signatures and orbits for the M-theory interpretation of the E8+++\nalgebra's where listed. These remain correct, but we are arguing in the present paper\nthat there is an extra consistency condition. As the highest root for the E8 algebra is\n\u03b1H = 2\u03b11 + 3\u03b12 + 4\u03b13 + 5\u03b14 + 6\u03b15 + 4\u03b16 + 2\u03b17 + 3\u03b18\n\n(88)\n\nthis extra condition, takes the following form for E8+++\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b12 + \u03b14 + \u03b18 , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(89)\n\nThese implies that some of the generalized signatures in [26] are inconsistent with Poincar\u00e9\nduality. The remaining ones organize in the orbits with signatures (note that the i0 (f )condition fixes the sign of the 3-form to (\u2212)T \u22121 where T is the number of time directions!)\n(1, 10);\n\n(2, 9);\n\n(5, 6);\n\n(6, 5);\n\n(9, 2);\n\n(10, 1)\n\n(90)\n\n(0, 11);\n\n(3, 8);\n\n(4, 7);\n\n(7, 4);\n\n(8, 3);\n\n(11, 0).\n\n(91)\n\nand\nThe first orbit contains the standard signatures of the M, M \u2032 and M \u2217 theories [11].\nThe second orbit contains precisely the remaining signatures. Though it is standard lore\nthat these 11-dimensional theories are non-supersymmetric, some of the 10 dimensional\ntheories included here seem to have supersymmetric extensions [37].\n34\n\n\fThe various signatures for the IIB theories can be derived straightforwardly. Note that\nthe i0 (f ) condition states that the space-time signature for a IIB-theory or a variant must\nbe (odd, odd). Variants of the IIB-theory cannot occur in signatures (even, even) because\nthe 4-form whose field strength will be (anti-)self dual is a singlet under the SL(2) coset\nsymmetries; we cannot tune its duality properties. The orbit with M-theories contains all\nthe signatures and sign patterns of the IIB, IIB \u2032 and IIB \u2217 theories [10, 11], the other\norbit contains the signatures (1, 9, \u2212, \u2212), (3, 7, +, +), (3, 7, +, \u2212), (5, 5, +, +), (7, 3, +, +),\n(7, 3, +, \u2212), and (9, 1, \u2212, \u2212) (in the notation of [15]).\n\n5.3\n5.3.1\n\nNon-simply laced and non-split G+++-algebra's\nNon-simply laced split\n\n+++\n\nBn\n\nn\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nn-2\n\nn-1\n\n+++\n\nCn\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nn-1\n\nn\n\n+++\n\nF4\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 4: Dynkin diagrams for the triple extended 2-laced algebra's.\nThe non-simply laced algebra's are distinguished by the appearance of short roots. Short\nroots can never be exchanged with the gravity sector (as these correspond to long roots).\nFor the space time signature these are hence of no interest. Signs for short roots are\n35\n\n\fpossible, but these just represent wrong signs in the matter sector. The time-like Tduality pattern follows in principle from the long roots. Of importance is therefore the\nlargest simply laced algebra inside the non-simply laced algebra's. These are given by\nBn+++ \u2283 Dn+++\n\nF4+++ \u2283 D4+++\n\n(92)\n\nThe long roots of Cn+++ are in some sense given by a \"triple extension of An1 \". This\nalgebra however does not allow a Dynkin diagram4 (curious readers may try n = 2), and\nthe easiest way to describe the corresponding algebra seems to be as a truncation of the\nCn+++ algebra, so this does not have many advantages.\nAs the highest root for the Bn algebra is\n\u03b1H =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n2\u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\n+ \u03b1n ,\n\n(93)\n\nthe index i0 (f ) for the Bn+++ algebra is given by\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b1n , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(94)\n\nA second index is given by\ni1 (f ) = h\u03b1n , f i mod 2.\n\n(95)\n\nThis is invariant due to the 2-laced nature of the algebra.\nThe theory allows two maximally oxidized variants. There is a D = n + 2-dimensional\ntheory, which contains General Relativity, a vector and its dual D \u2212 3-form, and a 2-form\nand its dual (D \u2212 4)-form. The sign of the kinetic term for the 2-form cannot be chosen\nfreely; the algebra requires the sign to be the square of the sign for the kinetic term of\nthe vector, and hence this is always +. Because of this, the i0 (f )-condition fixes the sign\nof the (D \u2212 3)-form once the space-time signature is embedded in the chain from \u03b1\u22122\nto \u03b1n\u22122 . None of these considerations fixes the sign of the vector, this is encoded in a\nseparate index i1 (f ).\nThese theories can easily be seen, both from the algebraic as from the physical perspective,\nto have the same time-like T-duality pattern as the theories with Dn+++ algebra, and\ni1 (f ) = 1 (because the two-form sign is fixed!), so we refer the reader to the discussion\nthere.\nA second branch for this theory gives a theory in 6 dimensions, with (2n \u2212 5) 2-forms\nsatisfying (anti-)self duality constraints. These transform in the vector representation of\na real form of Bn\u22123 . The i0 (f )-condition implies that the signature of the 6-dimensional\n4\n\nThe same is true for any non-simple group, which is probably one of the reasons why these theories\nhave not been considered much so far. Note that it is completely straightforward to define theories with\nnon-simple groups in 3-dimensions; it is their \"triple extension\" that is hard to define.\n\n36\n\n\ftheory is (odd, odd). The (even, even) signatures cannot be realized; these would require\ncomplex representations for the 2-forms, but the relevant representations (the vector representations (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2295 (1, n \u2212 3) of some real form of SO(n\u22122)\u00d7SO(n\u22123)) are always\nreal regardless of the choice of f .\nFor the Cn algebra's the highest root is\n\u03b1H =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n2\u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\n+ \u03b1n\n\n(96)\n\nFor the Cn+++ algebra the index i0 (f ) is given by\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b1n , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(97)\n\nFor n is even a second index reads\ni1 (f ) = h\n\nn/2\nX\n\n\u03b12i\u22121 , f i mod 2.\n\n(98)\n\ni=1\n\nAssociated to these algebra's are 4 dimensional theories of General Relativity, coupled to\na sigma model on Sp(n \u2212 1, R)/H and a bunch of vectors and their duals transforming\nin the fundamental 2n-dimensional representation. The denominator subgroup is a real\nform of GL(n \u2212 1, C). It can be GL(n, R), or U(n \u2212 p, p) for some value p (see appendix\nA of [15]). We immediately note that GL(n, R) is a group over the reals, while the\nrepresentations of U(n \u2212 p, p) are typically complex. The i0 (f ) condition relates the\npossible real form of GL(n, C) to the space-time signature. To be precise, for space-time\nsignature (even, even) the denominator subgroup in 4 dimensions must be a real group\n(because of duality requirements), and it can be shown that the i0 (f ) condition implies it\nis GL(n, R). For space-time signature (odd, odd) however, the i0 (f )-condition, as well as\nduality requirements state that H must be complex (and hence, of the form U(n \u2212 p, p).\nThe index i1 is correlated to the fact that we can change the sign of the vectors in 4\ndimensions; only for Cn+++ theories with n even this leads to a conserved quantity.\nThe time-like T-duality pattern is rather boring, because it is the same as for A+++\n1\n(4-dimensional general relativity) that does not allow any time-like T-dualities.\nFor F4 the highest root is\n\u03b1H = 2\u03b11 + 3\u03b12 + 4\u03b13 + 2\u03b14\n\n(99)\n\nFor F4+++ the index i0 (f ) is given by\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b12 , f i mod 2 = 1\n37\n\n(100)\n\n\fThis algebra gives rise to a 6-dimensional theory with SL(2, R) symmetry, with vectors\n(and their dual 3-forms) transforming in the 2 and 2-tensors in the 3. The index i0 (f ) implies that the 6-dimensional theory has signature (odd, odd). The (even, even) signatures\nare again impossible, because the sign of the 2-forms is again the square of the vectors\nhence +. It is easy to establish that it is impossible to change the space-time signature.\nAs we have argued the time-like T-duality pattern is the same as for D4+++ ; we however\nhave to take into account the extra restriction that the space-time signature is fixed to\n(odd, odd), which renders any signature change impossible.\nNote that signs from the gravity and fields described by long roots can run into the matter\nsector described by the short roots, which does allow sign changes in the matter sector.\nIt is the opposite direction that is impossible.\n\n+++\n\nG2\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 5: Dynkin diagram of the triple extended 3-laced algebra's.\nThere is only one 3-laced algebra among the triple extended algebra's, which is G+++\n.\n2\nThe highest root of G2 is\n\u03b1H = 2\u03b11 + 3\u03b12\n(101)\nThe index condition is\ni0 (f ) = h\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b10 + \u03b12 , f i mod 2 = 1\n\n(102)\n\nThe oxidation endpoint of this theory is 5 dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity. The i0\ncondition implies that the sign of the vector in 5 dimensions is determined by the spacetime signature. This is because the dual 2-form is at level 2, and hence its sign cannot\nbe adjusted. The i0 condition states essentially that the sign of the vector terms is in\naccordance to the (fixed) sign of its dual. With this proviso, every space-time signature\nis possible. A computation shows that the orbits under duality are essentially the same\nas those for 5 dimensional gravity.\n5.3.2\n\nNon-split groups\n\nOne advantage of the derivation of the criterion i0 (f ), is that it is clear that it immediately\ngeneralizes to theories that are not based on split real forms of the algebra G (for a survey\nthat encompasses all the simple algebra's that are not split, and the corresponding theories\n38\n\n\fsee [8]). We can allow G to be any real form as long as it is non-compact. One starts\nfrom coset sigma model in 3 dimensions on G/H (we will specify the possible H in a\nmoment), coupled to 3-dimensional general relativity. The obvious conjecture is that\nsuch theories fit into the framework of G+++ algebra's by extending their \"Tits-Satake\ndiagram\" (see e.g. [31]) by three more nodes. A Tits-Satake diagram is nothing but a\nDynkin diagram with decoration, so we extend the Tits- Satake diagram as we would for\nthe Dynkin diagram, while leaving the extra nodes without decoration5 (in [8] we already\ndefined (once) extended Tits-Satake diagrams).\nAlso here we could specify the signature in a function f , in the same way as we have\ndone in [26]. The only thing we wish to avoid is that f takes non-trivial values on the\ninvariant subspace of the Cartan-involution. If we, as in [15] inscribe the values of f on\nthe Tits-Satake diagram, it is clear that we should only allow f to have non-trivial values\nat white nodes, that are not decorated by arrows.\nAs long as there exists a 3-dimensional theory, our derivation of section 4 remains valid;\nwe never used any information about the real form of G there. So also in this case we\nshould have i0 (f ) = 1. We will not attempt any detailed analysis for this (vast) category\nof theories.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nIn this final section we describe, before reaching our conclusions, a number of issues\nthat should provide the reader with food for thought, and possibly directions for future\nresearch.\n\n6.1\n\nThe meaning of the i0 (f )-condition\n\nWe have derived and presented the i0 (f ) condition as a necessary condition to implement\nthe action of Poincar\u00e9 duality on G+++ algebra's in the correct way. Though of course\nthe relation to Poincar\u00e9 duality is sufficient to highlight the importance of i0 (f ), there\nare further questions that can and should be posed.\nOne observation is that the requirement of Poincar\u00e9 duality is in a sense \"external\"; we\nhave presented it as an argument related to the interpretation of the algebra as that of\na physical theory. There it is rooted in the calculus of differential forms, which does\n5\n\nIt is conceivable that the extra nodes could be decorated. But then an extension of the analysis\nof [8] combined with the usual framework of G+++ algebra's (extraction of matter content via level\ndecomposition, etc.) would lead us to conclude that these theories cannot be oxidized to theories in\ndimension 3 or higher. This hypothetical class of theories would hence be poorly understood both from\nthe mathematical and the physical side....\n\n39\n\n\fnot seem to lead to a direct relation with the G+++ algebra. Also the fact that we have\nderived it for a particular decomposition, related to 3-dimensional theories and then relied\non physical arguments to extrapolate to all theories that can be reconstructed from G+++\nalgebra's is somewhat dissatisfying. One would like to have a more \"internal\" explanation,\nwhere the condition would follow as a consistency requirement from some framework to\nset up the theory directly from the algebra. The only such framework with manifest\nG+++ -symmetry that has been proposed thus far [23] does not really seem to require the\ni0 (f ) condition from the outset, and one may (and probably should) wonder whether the\ncondition is hidden somewhere at a deeper level of the interpretation.\nAnother interesting issue is what the precise mathematical meaning of the i0 (f ) condition\nis: What exactly is the distinguishing feature that separates K(G+++ ) defined by an\nf with i0 (f ) = 1 from those with an i0 (f ) = 0? In the application to theories with\n(anti-)self-dual forms, the i0 (f ) condition ensures that the eigenvalues of the Hodge-star,\nand in particular whether they are real or imaginary, can be properly represented on the\nK(G+++ ) algebra. This leads us to suspect that the i0 (f ) condition may be some sort of\n\"reality condition\" on K(G+++ ). Whether this is the case could be verified if we knew\nthe representation theory for K(G+++ ), but at present too little is known about these\nalgebra's.\nThe cosets G+++ /K(G+++ ) hypothetically describe a theory which originally had a finite\nnumber of degrees of freedom, by an infinite number of variables. It is an open question\nwhether this should be interpreted as an indication for new degrees of freedom, or that\nthe finite number of degrees of freedom should arise after imposing (infinitely many ?)\nconstraints (as in proposals that suggest that the higher level fields contain the derivatives\nof lower level fields [33, 34, 23]). It is also possible that we may both need constraints and\nnew degrees of freedom. Most interpretations agree at least on the fact that both forms\nand dual forms are independently represented by G+++ algebra's. This indicates that the\ni0 (f )-condition either is one of the constraints necessary to reduce the number of degrees\nof freedom, or is implied by such constraints. Therefore we expect that it should play an\nessential role in the formulation of the theory with manifest G+++ /K(G+++ ) symmetry.\nYet another interesting issue that should be related to the i0 (f )-condition is the ability\nto couple the theories to spinors. It was observed in [40] that these should transform in\nrepresentation of K(G+++ ). This has not been made very precise thus far (but see the\nconstructions of [39, 38] relating to infinite-dimensional sub-algebra's of K(G+++ ), and\nthe attempt of [41] to implement supersymmetry in some G+++ -algebra's). Here we note\nthe close relation of Poincar\u00e9 duality to the properties of the Levi-Civita anti-symmetric\ntensor, and its important consequences for the representation theory of spinors, in particular their chirality properties. We therefore suspect that the i0 (f ) condition is relevant in\nthis context. If the i0 (f ) condition is indeed some sort of reality condition on K(G+++ ),\nas we have conjectured, then also the existence of (pseudo-)Majorana spinors in the lowenergy effective theory may be encoded by it. Needless to say, all these ingredients should\n40\n\n\fbe crucial for the possible supersymmetrization of some G+++ -theories, most notably for\nthe M-theory algebra E8+++ .\n\n6.2\n\nBrane solutions\n\nThere have been various attempts at relating p-brane solutions to G+++ -theories [23, 42,\n43, 45, 44, 29]. Typically one postulates (extremal) brane solutions for positive (real)\nroots \u03b1 of G+++ . Of course not every root can correspond to a genuine brane solution,\nfor example in Minkowski signature extremal branes should have the time-like direction\ncontained in their world-volume.\nIn the literature also S-branes are discussed [29]. The real solutions corresponding to\nthese cannot be extremal and hence are excluded from the category of solutions we wish to\ndiscuss. There exist so-called extremal S-branes that are essentially analytic continuations\nof the former real solutions, with imaginary charges. For this we would have to allow for\ncomplex fluxes; this would lead to a (partial) analytic continuation of the algebra, and\ntherefore to a relaxation of the strict conditions we have required for the representation\nof Poincar\u00e9 duality and the real form of the K(G+++ )-algebra's.\nThe restrictions on the world volume signature of extremal branes found in [12] can be\nneatly encoded in a simple constraint. It is easily seen that, to a positive root there can\nbe associated a genuine extremal brane solution if and only if\nh\u03b1, f i mod 2 = 1.\n\n(103)\n\nIn essence this equation guarantees the right number of minus-signs in the equation of\nmotion. This simple equation covers both the minus signs coming from the space-time\nsignature, and possible explicit signs in the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. Because it is\nformulated in terms of the invariant bilinear form, it transforms appropriately under Weyl\ngroup transformations and outer automorphisms (and hence under T- and S-dualities):\nIf the root \u03b1 gives a brane solution to a theory with generalized space-time signature\nencoded in f , then w(\u03b1) gives a brane solution to a theory with space-time signature\nencoded in w(f ), where w is an element of the Weyl group or an outer automorphism.\nIt is tempting to interpret h\u03b1, f i mod 2 = 0 as a condition for \"instantonic\", or S-branes.\nStrictly speaking however, the standard ansatz, with i0 (f ) = 1 and h\u03b1, f i mod 2 = 0 does\nnot lead to a solution. It was observed in [29] that S-brane solutions can be interpreted\nas solutions of theories in different space-time signatures. In the present language this\namounts to finding, for a given root \u03b1, an element f of the coweight lattice that obeys\ni0 (f ) = 1 and h\u03b1, f imod 2 = 1 simultaneously. There are in general many solutions to\nthese equations, defining just as many \"Wick rotations\" of the original theory. In view\nof this non-uniqueness of the Wick rotation, it is not quite clear what this continuation\nexactly means.\n41\n\n\f6.3\n\nThe stability of Kaluza-Klein-theories\n\nIt has been argued by Witten [46] that Kaluza-Klein space-times are unstable. The\noriginal example studies the theory arising from compactifying 5 dimensional General\nRelativity on a circle. It is argued that this space-time decays by the nucleation of\n\"bubbles of nothing\", with a decay time proportional to the radius of the circle.\nThe \"exotic dualities\" of [19] and the suggestive analysis of our section 2 seem to suggest\nthat this theory may allow a dual description, essentially as General relativity on a circle\nof inverse radius. There is clearly some tension between this T-duality, and the stability\nanalysis: It seems impossible to reconcile a decay time proportional to the radius of the\ncircle, with a dual description which essentially places the theory on a circle with inverse\nradius. Of course we should not jump to such conclusions. The analysis of [46] is only\nsemi-classical and valid in the limit of large radius, and should not be na\u0131\u0308veley extrapolated\nto small radius. The arguments of section 2 follow from a reckless extrapolation of semiclassical results, which also has questionable aspects.\nNote that in the hypothetical T-duality, in the limit of small circle size the KaluzaKlein monopoles play a role similar to that of D0 branes in IIA-theory. Their charges\norganize to give the spectrum of a Kaluza-Klein theory compactified on a dual circle,\nthat decompactifies when the radius of the original circle goes to zero. We cannot rely\non supersymmetry to claim that we have actually any control in the regime of small\ncircle size; this qualitative argument suggests however that the original space-time may\nno longer be the appropriate reference structure for such small circle sizes, because of the\npossible existence of a dual space-time which is non-geometrical in the original variables.\nIt is clear that this would lead to novel non-perturbative phenomena that have played\nno role in the analysis of the paper [46], and may offer new perspectives on avoiding its\nconclusions.\nIt is furthermore amusing to note that the paper [28] and the present paper seem to suggest\nthat the two description used in [46], the 5-dimensional Euclidean gravity on a circle and\nthe 5-dimensional Minkowski gravity on a circle are not only analytic continuations of\neach other, but actually dual space-times related by a T-duality.\n\n6.4\n\nGhosts in Euclidean theories\n\nOne of the main motivations for turning to theories in Euclidean signature has always\nbeen that the path-integral, and various quantities are better behaved in such signatures.\nIn terms of non-linear realizations this can be traced back to the compactness of the\nLorentz-group in these cases.\nFor G+++ algebra's, we have however argued that compact denominator sub-algebra's are\ninconsistent with Poincar\u00e9 duality. We therefore either have to sacrifice the possibility\n42\n\n\fof compact K(G+++ ), or the standard implementation of Poincar\u00e9 duality. There seems\nto be a sense in which minus-signs just cannot be avoided in a hypothetical formulation\nof the theory with G+++ /K(G+++ ) symmetries. This raises interesting questions on the\nexistence of no-ghost theorems and the elimination of non-physical degrees of freedom.\nLacking a detailed formalism, it seems far too premature to discuss such issues, but it is\ninteresting to note that, in the context of G+++ algebra's we eventually have to face these\nsign-problems, as dealing with them by analytic continuation leads at best to ambiguities.\n\n6.5\n\nConclusions\n\nTheories that exhibit enhanced, hidden symmetries upon reduction, allow oxidations to\ndifferent higher dimensional theories. The least one can say about G+++ algebra's is\nthat they form a bookkeeping device that correctly records all the possible reductions\nand oxidations. To correctly reproduce the space-time signatures and explicit signs for\nthese theories requires that Poincar\u00e9 duality is implemented correctly on these algebra's.\nWe have argued in the present paper that an element f of the coweight lattice Q(G+++ )\ncorrectly encodes a space-time signature and sign-pattern consistent with Poincar\u00e9 duality,\nif and only if it satisfies the condition\ni0 (f ) = 1.\n\n(104)\n\nPerhaps we should stress that this is not a conjecture: In spite of the fact that G+++\nalgebra's are far from well understood, the analysis we presented in section 5, reproduces\nall the results of section 2 which involved only established techniques.\nOf course the far more ambitious conjecture, that there should exist a formulation of\ntheories with (non-linearly realized, or linearized) G+++ symmetries, would imply that\nthe ambiguities in reduction and oxidation correspond to physically equivalent formulations of the theories. All these formulations would then be related by \"exotic T- and\nS-dualities\". Even theories of General Relativity have the appropriate structure to accommodate such exotic symmetries, and they are suggestive of interesting non-perturbative\ndynamics. Better still, a hypothetical non-perturbative extension of such a theory has\ndesirable properties, namely the ability to avoid certain classes of singularities (vanishing\ncircles/cycles). This property is usually advertised as a \"good\" property of string theories; trying to elevate it to a physical principle would place the theories with enhanced\nsymmetries, that inspired triple-extended algebra's, in a privileged position. It would be\nmost interesting to check these hypothetical dualities in more general situations, but it\nseems that the technology to do so has not been yet developed.\nStudying infinite-dimensional G+++ -algebra's and the corresponding theories by level expansions gives a direct and intuitive link to physics, but is necessarily limited to a finite\nnumber of levels, even with powerful computer algorithms. Information that can be encoded in an abstract fashion, such as (104) that restricts the signs to the ones consistent\n43\n\n\fwith Poincar\u00e9 dualities, and the condition for the existence of extremal branes (103), does\nnot refer to a specific theory or decomposition. We hope that more such abstract, duality\ninvariant tools will be developed; these should provide us with insights that reach beyond\nany expansion to finite level.\nAcknowledgements: I would like to thank Sophie de Buyl, Laurent Houart and Nassiba\nTabti, for sharing and discussing the results of [28] with me before publication, Axel\nKleinschmidt for discussions, and Paul Cook and Peter West for correspondence.\nThe author is a post-doctoral researcher for the \"FWO-Vlaanderen\".
