Supernova Remnants - Molecular Clouds - Cosmic Rays\n\n1. Introduction\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) are now widely considered to\nbe sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). Diffusive shock\nacceleration (DSA) (Axford et al. 1977; Krymskii 1977; Bell\n1978; Blandford & Ostriker 1978) and its non-linear modification (NDSA) (Malkov & O'C Drury 2001) predict a powerlaw distribution (N(E) \u221d E \u2212s ) of relativistic particles with\nindex s = 2 (s < 2 for the high-energy tail in NDSA).\nDespite recent advances in DSA and NDSA, it is still unclear why we observe soft (s > 2) CR spectra at Earth\n(Ave et al. 2009) and soft gamma-ray spectra from a number\nof SNRs: RX J0852.0-4622 (Aharonian et al. 2007), RCW 86\n(Aharonian et al. 2009), SN 1006 (Acero et al. 2010), Cas A\n(Acciari et al. 2010; Abdo et al. 2010a), and Tycho's SNR\n(Acciari et al. 2011; Giordano et al. 2012).\nUnderstanding gamma-ray SNR spectra in various situations\nrequires the study of the acceleration of the particles in the system (consisting of one or two shock waves), followed by the escape of these particles, their diffusion into the Galactic medium\n(Ptuskin et al. 2010; Caprioli et al. 2010), and computation of\nthe \u03b3-ray emission by various processes. In an earlier paper\n(Telezhinsky et al. 2012), we studied the acceleration of particles at SNR shock fronts. In this paper, we follow up this work\nby studying the escape of these particles from the system, and\ntheir interaction with dense media.\nA useful probe of the escape of particles from SNRs may\nbe high-energy gamma-ray emission from molecular clouds lo\u22c6\n\ne-mail: igor.telezhinsky@desy.de\n\ncated close to an efficiently accelerating SNR, the so-called\nMC-SNR systems. A number of these have been observed by\nCherenkov telescopes (CTs) and Fermi. Most sources, including W28 (Abdo et al. 2010b), W44 (Abdo et al. 2010c), IC 443\n(Acciari et al. 2009; Abdo et al. 2010d), G349.7+0.2, CTB 37A,\n3C391, and G8.7-0.1 (Castro & Slane 2010) are located close\nto dense regions or molecular clouds (MCs), thus one may use\nthem to infer the diffusion parameters in their vicinity. Triggered\nby these observations, a number of studies (Gabici et al. 2009;\nFujita et al. 2009) have attempted to explain the soft gamma-ray\nemission from MC-SNR systems in terms of escaped CRs. These\nstudies have been based on analytical models (Atoyan et al.\n1995; Aharonian & Atoyan 1996) and several assumptions: (i)\nthe SNR evolution is either stationary or Sedov-like, (ii) often\nthat particle acceleration is quasi-instantaneous compared with\nthe CR diffusion time, and (iii) the escaping-particle distribution is a power-law or monoenergetic at a given maximum momentum. The source of CRs is considered to be point-like, i.e.,\nthe SNR radius is much smaller than the distance to the MC.\nLi & Chen (2010), Li & Chen (2011), and Ohira et al. (2011),\nextended the analytical models to include finite-size sources and\nfinite-size target MCs.\nDespite their simplicity, the analytical studies demonstrate\nthat to explain observations, the diffusion coefficient in the SNR\nvicinity must be roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe average Galactic value, supporting earlier claims (Wentzel\n1974) that the diffusion coefficient might be smaller because\nof plasma waves that scatter particles. Using a simple model\nof SNR evolution and Monte Carlo simulations of CR diffu1\n\n\fI. Telezhinsky et al.: Time-dependent escape of CRs from SNRs, and their Interaction with dense media\n\nsion, Fujita et al. (2010) showed that particles may be trapped\naround the SNR for a significant period of time. Subsequently,\nFujita et al. (2011) confirmed this result using a transport equation to describe particle acceleration at the forward shock (FS),\nand then a simplified transport equation to follow the propagation of particles with p/m0 c \u2265 102.4 from the precursor boundary (set at four Bohm diffusion length-scales) to distances far\naway from the shock. These findings are consistent with the conclusions of Reville et al. (2009), who argue that beyond some\ncritical value, L, which they call the free-escape boundary, the\nnumber density of CRs falls significantly. The position of L is\ndictated by the level of excited magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nturbulence, which may be significant out to one SNR radius from\nthe FS (Zirakashvili & Ptuskin 2008). The detailed variation of\nthe turbulence amplitudes and the CR diffusion coefficient depends on the micro-physical balance of streaming instabilities\nand turbulence damping (Yan et al. 2012).\nBesides the diffusion coefficient in the SNR vicinity, other\nimportant aspects of the study of escaped CRs are their spectral and spatial distributions. These distributions affect the radiative properties of the SNR itself as escaping CRs modify\nthe high-energy part of the CR spectrum, and, if present, the\nradiative properties of the nearby dense matter consisting of a\nMC or a dense shell swept up by the winds of a high-mass SN\nprogenitor). Much of the research dealing with stationary and\n(semi-)analytical solutions cannot recover the spectral and spatial shapes of the CR distribution, but only gives the integrated\nescaping CR energy flux. Kinetic models provide the shape of\nthe distribution, which depends significantly on the assumed diffusion models. Ellison & Bykov (2011) parametrized the spectral distribution of escaping CRs, and then propagated the escaping CRs in the upstream region of the SNR obtaining spatial\ndistributions. They used a spherically symmetric code for the\nhydro simulations of the SNR evolution that is identical to the\ncode used in this work, but without the grid expansion that significantly increases the resolution. However, the particle acceleration was treated in a plane-parallel steady-state approximation ignoring dilution effects. Ellison & Bykov (2011) focused\non the core-collapse explosion of a massive star in a low density\nmedium surrounded by a dense shell, a case similar to our model\nfor a core-collapse SNR (CC-SNR) in a wind bubble.\nIn this paper, we investigate how both the spectrum of particles escaped from the SNR into a nearby MC or shell and the\nparticle emission due to interaction with dense matter depends\non the acceleration history of young ejecta-dominated Type-Ia\nand Type-Ic (core-collapse) SNRs, using given different assumptions about CR diffusion in the vicinity of the SNR. For this purpose, we combine a test-particle treatment of CR acceleration\nwith an account of escaping particles. We solve the CR transport equation in a spherically symmetric geometry. Our calculations are based on realistic high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution. We explore two SN types, focusing\non the complexities in the circumstellar environment. In the case\nof Type-Ia SNRs, we assume that evolution proceeds in a uniform ISM. We also consider a core-collapse SNR arising from a\nWolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor, expanding in the wind-blown bubble created by the progenitor star. The SNR shock wave first\nevolves in the freely expanding wind of the progenitor, and then,\nbeyond the wind-termination shock, in the shocked-wind region.\nSubsequently, we would expect the shock to impact the dense\nshell bordering the wind-blown bubble. However, our intention\nhere is to study the interaction of the accelerated particles produced by the SNR with this dense shell, hence we terminated\nthe SNR evolution before the shock-shell impact took place. We\n2\n\nconsidered particle acceleration at both the forward and reverse\nshock. In addition, in the CC-SNR case we consider particle reacceleration at secondary shocks formed when the SNR forward\nshock collides with the termination shock of the wind zone. The\nspatial domain considered in our particle simulations extends to\nabout 100 times the SNR radius to facilitate the study of particle escape. The \"absorbing\" boundary located that far from the\nSNR does not affect the result of our simulations. It is the spatial\nprofile of the diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the SNR that\ndetermines the degree to which particles can escape from the CR\nprecursor. To estimate the observational consequences of CR escape, we consider the interaction of the escaped particles with a\ntarget MC close to a Type-Ia SNR, or in the core-collapse case\nwe consider the interaction of CRs with the dense shell. The\nMC/shell are located well inside the simulation domain, hence\nwe know the cosmic-ray number density at their location at any\ntime. Using two different models of the CR diffusion upstream\nof the FS, we calculated the evolutions of both the cosmic-ray\nspectra at the location of the MC/shell and the hadronic gammaray emission as the SNR shock approaches the MC/shell. If not\nstated otherwise, we refer to particles as escaped when they have\nescaped from the precursor region of the FS and are found at the\nlocation of the MC or shell. The respective particle spectra are\naveraged over the volume of the MC or shell.\n\n2. Method\nWe describe the hydrodynamics of the expanding SNR by numerical simulations. For the Type-Ia SNR, we use the ejectadensity profile described in Dwarkadas & Chevalier (1998), expanding into a constant-density medium. The simulation itself\nis described in detail in Telezhinsky et al. (2012). The evolution\nof core-collapse Type-Ic SNRs is much more complicated. We\nassume that the formation of a wind-blown bubble is similar to\nthat described by Dwarkadas (2005, 2007). The WR wind is assumed to have a mass-loss rate of 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and a velocity\nof 1500 km s\u22121 . The wind termination shock is assumed to be a\nstrong shock that forms at a radius of 7 pc. As the SNR shock\nexpands outwards in radius, it evolves in the freely expanding\nwind, impacts the wind termination shock, and then evolves into\na constant density shocked wind. Finally, although this is not included in the current simulation, the shock will collide with the\ndense wind-blown shell surrounding the bubble.\nWe treat CRs as test particles in gas-flow profiles given by\nthe simulations described above. Our method (Telezhinsky et al.\n2012) is based on a numerical solution of the CR transport equation in a grid co-moving with the shock wave. To ensure sufficient resolution near the shock, the spatial coordinate is substituted with a new coordinate, x\u2217 , for which a uniform grid is used\nwhen solving the particle transport equation\n!\nr\n(x \u2212 1) =\n\u2212 1 = (x\u2217 \u2212 1)3 .\n(1)\nR sh\nThus, a rather coarse grid in x\u2217 is transformed into a very fine\ngrid in x close to the shock, where the high resolution is needed\nto properly account for the acceleration of newly injected particles. At the same time, this transformation allows us to significantly extend the grid far into the ISM (x \u226b 1) with only\na small extension in x\u2217 . The resolution obviously deteriorates\nwith distance from the shock, but the mean free path of the particles in the CSM/ISM is orders of magnitude larger than in\nthe shock vicinity, thus permitting the use of a moderate resolution. The extension of the grid to several dozens of SNR radii,\n\n\fI. Telezhinsky et al.: Time-dependent escape of CRs from SNRs, and their Interaction with dense media\n\n3.

We therefore assume that the MF\nin the shock vicinity is amplified, e.g. by streaming CRs (Bell\n2004). Although in general both resonant and non-resonant\nmodes operate, non-resonant amplification probably dominates\nin the early stages of SNR evolution (Caprioli et al. 2009). The\namplified field is then given by\ns\n!\nV s (t)3\n\u03be(t),\n(2)\nB0 (t) = 2\u03c0\u03c1u (t)\nc\n\n400 yr\n1000 yr\n2000 yr\n\nT1\n\n2.5\n\nlog B [\u03bcG]\n\nand the spherical geometry, imply that the volume upstream of\nthe shock is much larger than downstream. The co-moving grid\nobliterates any need to introduce an artificial \"absorbing\" or \"escape\" boundary because the particles will never reach it during\nthe simulation time. The number of particles escaping from the\nSNR shock is defined purely by the diffusion properties of the\nupstream region. We do not need to define the diffusive flux\nthrough some artificial boundary to count the particles escaping\nthrough this boundary. In the current approach, owing to the grid\nextension the total number of injected particles is conserved and\ndistributed over the considered volume according to diffusion.\nBy the end of the simulation, we observe at the boundary of the\nsimulation domain only numerical noise, which indicates that\nthe boundary is reached by an insignificant fraction of particles.\nTechnically, a macroscopic treatment of diffusion does not differentiate between individual particles bouncing back and forth\nin the shock precursor, thus all particles found upstream of the\nFS can be assumed to have escaped from the SNR1 . Here we are\ninterested in particles found at the location of the MC/shell (sufficiently far away from the shock precursor), and so we refer to\nthese particles as escaped.\nSince our method is based on the test-particle approximation, it requires that the CR pressure at the shock be less than\n10% of the ram pressure. We use a thermal-leakage injection\nmodel (Blasi et al. 2005), and adjust the injection so that the CRpressure limit is not violated. The injection coefficient, a free parameter, is adjusted to be approximately 3 * 10\u22127 for the Type-Ia\nSNR, and 5 * 10\u22126 for CC-SNR.\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nr [pc]\n\nFig. 1. Time dependence of magnetic-field profiles for type-Ia\n(top) and core-collapse (bottom) SNRs.\nat 0.05 RFS ahead of the FS (Zirakashvili & Aharonian 2010),\nand likewise down to the very small ejecta field (0.01-0.1 \u03bcG) at\n0.05 RRS toward the interior of the SNR.\nTo define the magnetic field in the wind zone of the WR\nstar, we assume that the dominant component at large distances\nis merely the toroidal component of the stellar surface magnetic\nfield, which decreases outwards with radius. Thus, this component is defined as\nBc (R) =\n\nB sRWR\n,\nR\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B s \u2248 100 G is the MF at the surface of WR star, RWR =\n8R\u2299 is the radius of WR star, and R is the distance from the star.\nBeyond the WR wind zone, in the constant density region, the\nMF is assumed to be constant and equal to the shock-compressed\nvalue at the edge of the WR wind zone. We assume a constant\nMF in the MC/shell, since it has been found that the MF does\nnot increase if the number density in the cloud, n . 300cm\u22123\n(Crutcher et al. 2010). The evolution of the MF profiles for two\ntypes of SNR is shown in Fig. 1.\n3.2. Diffusion models\n\nTo study the propagation of cosmic rays in the vicinity of SNRs,\nit is necessary to make assumptions about the efficiency of diffusion close to the SNR shock. We note that the type of particle scattering does not depend on the amplitude of the MF,\n3\n\n\fI. Telezhinsky et al.: Time-dependent escape of CRs from SNRs, and their Interaction with dense media\n\nbut rather on the wave-number spectrum of MHD turbulence.\nIn other words, one can have Bohm-type diffusion in the nonamplified MF even significantly far away from the shock. Bohm\ndiffusion is widely assumed to operate close to the shock and\ninside the SNR, otherwise DSA theories would fail to explain\nparticles with energies up to the \"knee\". On the other hand, the\naverage diffusion coefficient in the Galaxy is much larger than\nBohmian, and inevitably there must be a transition between the\nsmall Bohmian coefficient and the large Galactic coefficient.\nSince the transition from Bohm diffusion in the vicinity\nof the forward shock to Galactic diffusion further away is not\nclearly understood, we consider two different models of CR diffusion outside the SNR. In model D1, the diffusion coefficient is\nBohmian inside the SNR and in the FS upstream region, up to\na fiducial boundary, L = 2RS NR , at which the transition to the\nGalactic diffusion occurs. We emphasize that the boundary L is\nnot a physical boundary in any sense, and does not denote an\n\"escape\" boundary as in our previous work. It is merely a convenient radius at which the transition in diffusion coefficient is\nassumed to occur. In this model the diffusion coefficient is defined as\n(\nDB r \u2264 L,\n(5)\nD(r) =\nDG r > L,\nwhere the Bohm diffusion coefficient is given by\npvc\nDB =\n(6)\n3qB\nwhile the Galactic diffusion coefficient is taken to be\n(Berezinskii et al. 1990)\n\u0012 E \u0013\u03b1 B !\u2212\u03b1\nDG = D0\ncm2 /s,\n(7)\n10 GeV\n3\u03bcG\n\nwhere E is the CR energy and D0 is the normalization.\nFollowing a statistical analysis of cosmic-ray propagation models (Trotta et al. 2011), we use D0 = 1029 cm2 /s and \u03b1 = 1/3.\nIn model D2, we explore a less abrupt transition to Galactic\ndiffusion. We assume that Bohm diffusion is valid both inside\nthe SNR and in the FS upstream region stretching out to 5%\nof the SNR radius, i.e., up to l = 1.05RS NR . Between l and L,\nwe introduce an intermediate diffusion coefficient, smaller than\nthe Galactic diffusion coefficient, thus mimicking the presence\nof MHD waves, which may be invoked by CRs streaming away\nfrom the SNR (Yan et al. 2012). We define the diffusion coefficient in D2 model as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nD\nRS NR \u2264 r \u2264 l,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 B\n\u03c7DG l < r \u2264 L,\nD(r) = \uf8f4\n(8)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 DG r > L,\n\nwhere \u03c7 = 0.01. A schematic view of the diffusion models and\ncorresponding boundaries is given in Fig. 2.\nWe do not consider the confinement of particles by the\ndense shell at the boundary of the WR wind zone in the CCSNR models as done by Ellison & Bykov (2011). The ionneutral friction in dense and partially ionized media may suppress plasma instabilities, and thus increase the diffusion coefficient (Ptuskin & Zirakashvili 2005; Drury 2011). Similar arguments would apply to MCs. For instance, Everett & Zweibel\n(2011) consider the diffusion coefficient in MCs to be 1%\u2013500%\nof the Galactic value. They claim that this variation does not significantly affect their findings, which state that the cosmic-ray\ndensity does not increase within clouds. Therefore, we assume\nthat the diffusion coefficient inside the MC/shell is the same as\nin the surrounding medium. A possible variation of the diffusion\ncoefficient inside the MC/shell and the resulting consequences\nfor our calculations are discussed in subsection 4.1.\n\n4. Results and discussion\nWe have calculated the confined and escaped cosmic-ray spectra\nat 400, 1000, and 2000 years after explosion, assuming the diffusion models described above. We have also calculated the corresponding emission from the SNRs and the target material in their\nvicinity. In calculating the emission, we considered only CR protons, and their radiation via pion decay (Huang et al. 2007).\nGiven the initial parameters assumed in the simulation, the\nType-Ia SNR approaches the Sedov stage after around 1000\nyears. Beyond this time, we approximate the plasma-flow profiles with a Sedov solution (Cox & Franco 1981). Although hydrodynamically the RS is still present, usage of the Sedov solution is justified since the contribution from the RS to particle\nand emission spectra is negligible at that time (Telezhinsky et al.\n2012). After 2000 years, the FS radius in Type-Ia SNR is\nabout 8 pc. The CC-SNR, on the other hand, by design, expands in a wind of much lower density, followed by a constantdensity shocked-wind zone, and therefore remains in the ejectadominated stage until the end of the simulation. At the edge of\nthe constant-density zone, we assume the presence of a cold, thin\n(0.5 pc) dense shell of swept-up material, similar to those known\nto exist around WR stars (Cappa et al. 2003). After 2000 years,\nthe forward shock of this Type-Ic SNR has expanded out to a\nradius of about 14 pc.\nThe spectrum of particles interacting with the MC is a function of its distance from the SNR shock, as well as the diffusion\ncoefficient. We consider two center-to-center distances from the\nType-Ia SNR to the MC, 12 pc (the \"near\" scenario) and 16 pc\n(the \"far\" scenario), thus study the effect of a variation in the\ndiffusion coefficient on the particle spectrum as the cloud approaches the SNR. The MC is assumed to have a radius of 4 pc\nand a mass of Mc \u2248 1500 M\u2299, corresponding to a number density nc = 150 cm\u22123 .\nFor the CC-SNR case, we consider a swept-up shell located\nat 16 pc (the \"near\" scenario) or at 30 pc (the \"far\" scenario).\nThe number density of the shell, n s = 100 cm\u22123 , corresponds to\na mass M s \u2248 1300 M\u2299 for the \"near\" and M s \u2248 4500 M\u2299 for the\n\"far\" scenario. We note that the gamma-ray flux simply scales\nwith the gas mass in the MC or the dense shell, and therefore the\nchoice of mass only affects the normalization of the spectra.\n4.1.

All spectra are volumeaveraged. The Galactic CR background and its gamma-ray emission are shown for comparison.\nWe note from the figures that the choice of diffusion model\ninfluences the cut-off energy in the spectra of the confined particles, as well as the energy of the spectral peak of escaped CRs.\nParticle acceleration becomes slow when the CR precursor extends to the radius l in the upstream region at which diffusion\nbecomes faster in the D2 model. Thus, the spectra of confined\nparticles cut off at lower energies, and likewise the spectra of escaped CRs have maxima at lower energies, because escape from\nthe SNR is more efficient. In both models of diffusion and both\ntypes of SNR, we do not observe any significant contribution\nof the RS to the population of the CRs found upstream of the\nFS. This is partly because the reverse-shock contribution diminishes with time, and is largely negligible after about 1000 years.\nFurthermore, since the MF is assumed to scale with the SNR\ndensity in the shocked interaction region, the large MF at the\ncontact discontinuity, and the low maximum energy attained by\nCRs at the reverse shock do not permit particles accelerated at\nthe RS to diffuse out of the SNR.\nIn Type-Ia SNR, the spectral shapes of escaped particles in\nthe D1 and D2 diffusion models are similar. They have a narrow, parabola-like shape at a certain energy, usually referred\nto as Emax , that is consistent with the approximations made by\nEllison & Bykov (2011). The intensity changes with time depending on the assumed distance to the MC. In the \"far\" scenario, the MC always stays beyond the L boundary, and the intensity of the CR spectra at the location of the MC rapidly decreases with time on account of dilution. In the \"near\" scenario,\nthe MC is partially (after 1000 years) or totally (after 2000 years)\n\nwithin L, where the number density of CRs is high. However, the\nCRs in the D2 model have a shallower gradient than in the D1\nmodel, and so the CR illumination of the MC increases even if\nthe MC is only partially within L (1000 years). In the D1 model,\nthe spectrum is still affected by dilution, and it is only later (after 2000 years), when the MC is totally inside L, that the spectral\nintensity rises dramatically.\nThe behavior of escaped particles in the D1 model is similar for both types of SNR. However, the spectral shape of the\nescaped particles in the D2 model is somewhat different in the\nCC-SNR case. The spectral peak for the escaped CRs shifts to\nhigher energies with time. Therefore, an asymmetry is seen in\ntheir spectra, most visibly so at later times.\nWe now discuss the consequences of a different diffusion coefficient inside the MC/shell. First, we note that the shell thickness is so small that the shell spectra are virtually unaffected, unless the diffusion coefficient inside is extremely small. Suppose\nthen that the plasma waves are damped so effectively that the\ndiffusion coefficient inside the MC increases significantly (about\nten times) with respect to the diffusion coefficient of the surrounding medium. It is obvious that the CRs will quickly attain\na uniform distribution inside the MC, and the CR number density at the far side of the MC will be nearly equal to that at the\nnear side. This should affect the CR intensity inside the MC after about 1000 years, when the MC is located at a position corresponding to a strong gradient in the CR distribution (it is partially within boundary L). Estimates show that the CR intensity\nin this case may increase by a factor of a few. At other times, the\ndifferences will be marginal.\nThe diffusion coefficient inside the MC may also be lower\nthan in the ISM. This may be due to a strong gradient in CRs at\n5\n\n\fI.

A reasonable value could\nbe 0.01DG . We note that this case may affect the D1 model after\n1000 years in the same manner as described above, because the\ndiffusion coefficient inside the MC will be larger than within the\nboundary L. Spectra at other times and for other models should\nnot be affected. The main effect of a reduced diffusion coefficient\ninside the MC is the longer penetration time and consequently a\ndelay in the illumination of the MC. If one estimates the time\nneeded for a 10-TeV particle to reach the center of the MC,\none finds t = R2MC /2D MC \u2243 230 years, where D MC = 0.01DG .\nHowever, the outer 1.5-pc thick shell of the MC would then supply 80% of the flux, and a 10-TeV CR would need only \u223c30\nyears to penetrate to this depth. The delay in illumination is\ntherefore negligible compared with the uncertainties in the size\nand structure of the MC.\n4.2. Spatial distributions of CRs\n\nTo study the propagation of escaping particles in the medium\naround SNRs and understand the significance of their contribution to the local CR level, we plot the radial distributions of particles of given energies for different types of SNR and different\ndiffusion model. Fig. 5 presents the radial distributions of protons at the peak energy in the spectra of escaped CRs, which is\nsometimes referred to as Emax . This energy changes with time,\ntherefore at each time particles of different energy are plotted\n(thick lines), along with the corresponding Galactic background\n(thin lines). The evolution of Emax is shown in Fig. 8 and dis6\n\ncussed below. We observe significant confinement of cosmic-ray\nparticles close to the shock for all SNRs and diffusion models,\neven at the highest particle energies. Remarkably, for Type-Ia\nSNR in both diffusion models the highest-energy CRs still dominate over the background at a few SNR radii, whereas for CCSNR this happens only in the D2 diffusion model. This may be\nbecause in our simulations the Type-Ia SNR propagates into a\nmedium of higher average density, and therefore has a radius\nroughly twice as small as the CC-SNR, which implies less dilution. The CC-SNR produce a lower CR energy density than\nType-Ia SNRs owing to the lower density at the FS, hence lower\ninjection into the acceleration process. Therefore, the intensity of\nCRs around CC-SNR only marginally exceeds the background.\nWhile these results are applicable to Type-Ic SNR, they are not\nto SNR of Type-IIP. The latter could have even smaller radii than\nType-Ia, for instance, as they expand within the high-density red\nsupergiant wind. In future papers, we will discuss the various\nSNR types in more detail.\nWe are particularly interested in the spatial distribution of\nCRs that produce TeV-band gamma-ray emission. We show the\ntime evolution of these distributions for a CR energy of 20 TeV\nin Fig. 6, including for comparison the Galactic CR background.\nWe note from this figure that in the D1 diffusion model, 20-TeV\nCRs are trapped very close to the SNR shock (. 1.4RS NR for\nType-Ia SNR and . 1.2RS NR for CC-SNR) at all times. Even in\nthe D2 model, in which the diffusion coefficient is very large, at\nlate times the intensity of 20-TeV CRs exceeds the background\nat a few RS NR only in the case of a Type-Ia SNR. Therefore,\nthe detection of gamma-ray emission from MCs as probe of\nhadronic acceleration in SNR in the era of Fermi and current CTs\n\n\fI.

Type-Ia SNRs are\nshown in the top row and core-collapse SNR in the bottom row.\nis a far more complicated task than previously thought. The object observed is always a composite of the SNR itself, emission\nfrom the MC, or a dense shell illuminated by freshly accelerated\nCRs, and the emission of interactions between upstream CRs\nand the ambient diluted gas. One may be successful in scenarios\nin which the MC is located close to the SNR. The distance to the\nMC should then be generally smaller or comparable to RS NR ,\notherwise at the location of the MC/shell the background CRs\ndominate over the CRs from the SNR. This is a direct consequence of both diffusion and dilution, which becomes a serious\nfactor at large distances from the SNR.\n4.3. Gamma-ray emission from the SNR-MC/shell\n\nWe calculated the gamma-ray emission from the MC/shell illuminated by CRs that had escaped from the SNR. For comparison, we plot their spectra together with the emission spectra\nfrom the SNRs themselves (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, lower panels). The\ngamma-ray emission is only moderately affected by the choice\nof diffusion model. In the case of the D2 model, we observe\nhigher fluxes at lower energies and also that the spectral peak\nis shifted to lower energies, thus making the spectra soft in the\nband above \u223c 10 TeV. The spectra thus reflect the spatial variation in the diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the SNR. In\nType-Ia SNR, the MC is always significantly brighter than expected when illuminated by Galactic CRs. In contrast, the dense\nshell around a CC-SNR does not experience a significantly enhanced CR illumination until the shock is very close. The emission from the CC-SNR itself is never particularly bright, and\n\nso at late times the shell emission strongly dominates. On the\nother hand, the Type-Ia SNR dominates the intensity distribution\nof the SNR-MC system in all scenarios and diffusion models,\nbut only at the latest time, and in the \"near\" scenario the emission levels of SNR and MC become comparable. The intensity\nof gamma-ray emission from the MC/shell obviously strongly\ndepends on the mass carried by the MC/shell, but the trend described above holds and may permit us to differentiate between\nType-Ia and Type-Ic SNRs .\nAdditionally, for model D2 we constructed the intensity distributions of gamma-ray emission from Type-Ia SNR/MC and\nCC-SNR/shell systems, along with the background created by\nthe upstream CRs in the vicinity of the SNR (see Fig. 7). Since\nthe number density of CRs confined within boundary L significantly exceeds the number density of CRs beyond L, we consider L as the boundary of the SNR vicinity. One can see how\nthe expanding halo of upstream CRs illuminates the surrounding diluted gas and dense matter. The sharp contrast in brightness between the inner and outer parts of the MC at the age of\n1000 years arises from the abrupt transition from intermediate\nto Galactic diffusion and is in that sense an artifact. Moreover,\nas noted earlier in subsection 4.1, if the diffusion coefficient inside the MC were larger than that in the surrounding medium,\nthe CR illumination of the MC after 1000 years would be more\nuniform so that the far side becomes brighter. However, the image, though idealized, is not unrealistic. The bright outer ring\nin CC-SNR intensity maps is the swept-up shell illuminated by\nescaping CRs. The smaller ring at the age of 1000 years corresponds to the contact discontinuity (CD) of the CC-SNR. The\n7\n\n\fI.

Emax\n\nDifferent authors may define Emax in different ways, e.g., the\nmaximum energy at which particles leave the system, the cutoff energy, or the peak in the spectrum of escaped particles. In\npractice, these definitions should provide nearly identical values.\nIn some models of CR acceleration, including analytical studies\nof CR escape, Emax is a free parameter used in lieu of a freeescape boundary.\nThe time evolution of Emax is a crucial issue. We derive Emax\nfrom fitting the spectra of escaped CRs for each SNR type and\ndiffusion models. The results are plotted in Fig. 8, along with\nthe results of Ellison & Bykov (2011) and Gabici et al. (2009).\nAlthough we consider MF amplification (MFA), we do not find\nas rapid a decrease in Emax as predicted by Gabici et al. (2009).\nOur curves are more compatible with those of Ellison & Bykov\n(2011), although they did not include MFA. Most analytical\nstudies are based on the Sedov solution, MFA, and the assumption that particles start leaving the system at the beginning of\nthe Sedov stage when the highest energies are reached (e.g.\nGabici et al. 2009). When we accurately account for the evolution of a young SNR, in which the shock velocity is not constant\nand falls with time, and we include the effects of dilution by considering spherically symmetric systems, we find that particles\n8\n\nleave the SNR during the \"free expansion\" stage. In addition,\nDrury (2011) reminds us that escape is a random process and it\nis only in a probabilistic sense controlled by the ratio of the diffusion length to SNR radius. Therefore, in our opinion solving\none diffusion-advection equation for all CRs, both those trapped\ninside the SNR and those \"escaping\", is the best way to treat the\nproblem. At any instant, one can easily see which particles are\ninside and which outside the SNR. Defining Emax by the spectrum of CRs that have escaped into the MC/shell and observing\nthe time evolution of Emax , one notices a dramatic difference between our result and that derived with Sedov scaling. Moreover,\nas shown in Fig. 8, besides the early SNR evolution and SNR\ntype, the evolution of Emax may also depend on the assumed diffusion model. We must note, however, that the trend seen in CCSNRs for a D2 diffusion model may be an artifact arising from\nour choice of transition boundary from Bohm to intermediate\ndiffusion coefficient, \u03c7DG . In our case, the transition is at 5% of\nthe SNR radius, which given the CC-SNR evolution, is roughly\nequal to the size of the CR precursor, DB (Emax )/V s . If the CR\nprecursor extends into a region with a large diffusion coefficient,\nshock acceleration loses efficiency, thus effectively prescribing\nthe Emax . With time and increasing SNR radius, the physical separation of the forward shock and the transition point in the diffusion model increases, thus permitting particles to reach higher\nenergies.\n\n\fI.

General remarks\n\nEllison & Bykov (2011) provided analytical approximations of\nthe spectra of escaping particles, which were then incorporated\ninto their Monte Carlo cosmic-ray propagation model. Our results on the spectra of escaped CRs are compatible with those\nof Ellison & Bykov (2011), if the shock is sufficiently far away\nfrom the location of interest and the system is still young. At\nlater times, the time evolution of Emax (see Fig. 8) leads to the\nformation of tails in the spectra of escaped CRs, that are populated by particles that left the remnant early (see the 2000-year\nplot at Fig. 4).\nWe noted that for both types of SNR and diffusion model\n(especially in D1) we find a significantly smaller intensity ratio\n\nof escaped CRs to trapped CRs at Emax than Ellison & Bykov\n(2011), even considering their use of NDSA. This discrepancy\npossibly arises from the neglect of dilution in their model.\nWe compared the radial profiles with those presented in the\nliterature. In general, the radial profiles obtained in our D2 models are compatible with those in Fujita et al. (2011) (model C\ndisregarding the growth of Alfv\u00e9n waves) and with the profiles\nof Ellison & Bykov (2011) (propagation in pure CSM) out to a\nradius of RSNR from the shock. These authors, however, did not\nmake any comparisons with the background level as their results\nare presented in arbitrary units. We were unable to find research\nthat shows the profiles for pure Bohm diffusion out to a full SNR\nradius from the shock.\n9\n\n\fI.

Observational implications\n\nThe TeV-band intensity map of the young Type-Ia SNR Tycho\nobserved with VERITAS (Acciari et al. 2011) shows off-center\nemission, which may correspond to a fluctuation. However, it\nmay also indicate an interaction of escaping CRs with a nearby\nMC. If this is true, Fig. 3 suggests that in the GeV band emission from the SNR itself should dominate. So, if the TeV-band\nemission indeed partly originates from an illuminated MC outside the remnant, the component from the SNR itself must have\na softer spectrum than suggested by a naive comparison of Fermi\nand VERITAS data.\nAnother interesting example is the young TeV-bright CCSNR RX J1713.7-3946 detected with Fermi (Abdo et al. 2011).\nEllison et al. (2011) applied their model to explain its highenergy emission via escaping CRs and found that this scenario is\nvery unlikely. However, Fig. 4 indicates peculiar spectral transitions, in particular for the D2 model, that make multi-component\nspectra quite conceivable in which most of the GeV-band emission arises from the SNR itself, whereas a substantial fraction of\nTeV-band emission originates from gas exterior to the remnant.\nMore careful modeling is needed to test the applicability of this\nscenario to RX J1713.7-3946.\nAlthough our treatment extends only over the first 2000 years\nof SNR evolution, we note that the rather peculiar spectra of\nCC-SNRs found in our models have spectral breaks that appear\nsimilar to those observed from some older Fermi SNRs (e.g.\nCastro & Slane 2010; Abdo et al. 2010d). In addition, the observed discrepancy in the locations of the TeV and (sub-)GeV\nemission in the SNR vicinity can be considered in line with\nour models. For instance, as seen from the lower panels of\nFig. 3 and 4, the emission from the dense matter far away from\nthe SNR may dominate at TeV energies and disappear at low\n(sub-)GeV energies. At the same time, the emission from the\nSNR itself would be stronger at GeV and weaker at TeV energies. Altogether, this makes the emission \"peak\" move over the\nimage with the changing energy of the observations. In some\nsense, a similar scenario is put forward by the AGILE team\n(Giuliani et al. 2011) for the regions around SNRs W28 and\nIC 443, to explain why in the GeV-band the peak-emission error\nbox is separated from the TeV-emission error box observed by\nVERITAS and MAGIC.\n10\n\nWe have modified our modeling technique developed in\nTelezhinsky et al. (2012) to examine the distribution of escaped\nCRs at distances far from SNRs. Our approach combines a realistic treatment of SNR evolution using hydrodynamic simulations with test-particle calculations of CR acceleration, by\nsolving the transport equation of cosmic rays in a spherically\nsymmetric geometry. Both the reverse and forward shocks are\nincluded in these simulations. We also account for the reacceleration at reflected shocks in core-collapse SNR. Our approach inherently includes the effects of dilution due to the expansion of the system, as well as the finite size of the SNR and\nany gas target illuminated by escaping CRs. It permits the reconstruction of the spectra of escaped CRs at any given distance\nfrom the source.\nWe have shown that the peak energy and intensity of escaped\nparticles strongly depends on the efficiency of the diffusion in the\nvicinity of the SNR. If diffusion is Bohmian out to the boundary\nL = 2RSNR , CRs are very efficiently confined to the SNR, and\nonly the highest-energy particles are able to diffuse out to some\ndistance from the SNR. Even though CRs at Emax leave the SNR,\nthey are still trapped at distances far less than one SNR radius\nfrom the FS. If the diffusion coefficient in the FS upstream region is much larger than Bohmian, but not at the level of average\nGalactic diffusion, then CRs of lower energy are able to escape\nfrom the SNR. Consequently, one observes the broader spectra\nof escaped CRs with lower Emax and the cut off in the spectra of\nconfined CRs is slower than exponential.\nIt is possible but difficult to constrain the diffusion coefficient\nin the vicinity of the SNR using the emission from nearby dense\nmaterial. The particles cannot generally propagate far from the\nshock. Thus, to study CR acceleration in SNRs via CR escape\ninto a nearby MC or shell, one needs to find MCs or shells located very close, unless the diffusion coefficient in the immediate\nenvironment of the SNR is a significant fraction of the average\nGalactic one, in which case Emax is lower. We note that in all\ndiffusion models, and especially in the \"far\" scenarios, one can\nclearly observe the striking effect of dilution, i.e. the decrease in\nthe CR intensity upstream of the FS, introduced by the spherical geometry of the SNR. Ignoring the spherical geometry of\nthe system is a serious mistake when one models the gammaray emission from MCs placed at significant distances from the\nSNRs.\nWe find that Type-Ia SNR in our simulation has a higher CR\nenergy density in its vicinity than Type-Ic core-collapse SNR.\nTherefore, Type-Ia SNR may have brighter pion-decay gammaray emission than Type-Ic SNR that is still evolving in the wind\nzones of its progenitor star. The emission of Type-Ia SNR is\nnormally brighter than the MC emission until the SNR shock\nis very close to the MC. Only then is the gamma-ray flux from\nthe MC comparable to that from the SNR. The emission from\nthe CC-SNR and the wind-blown shell is initially near the background level. At a later stage, the shell emission can significantly\ndominate over the SNR emission. Although the exact scenario\ndepends on the MC/shell parameters, most importantly the target mass, the described trend may serve to differentiate between\nthese SNR types.\nFinally, we find that the commonly used approximation for\nthe Emax evolution based on Sedov scaling is not reproduced\nwhen the evolution of the SNR shocks is computed accurately.\nMoreover, the Emax behavior critically depends on the diffusion\ncoefficient in the vicinity of the SNR.\n\n\fI.
