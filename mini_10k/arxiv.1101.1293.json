We fabricated and tested a Luneburg lens in silicon\nphotonics. Our technique is sufficiently versatile for making perfect imaging\ndevices on silicon platforms.\n\nLenses are indispensible optical instruments, but most conventional lenses suffer\nfrom aberrations [1] - the focus depends on the direction of incidence and deteriorates off axis. The Luneburg lens [2, 3] can focus light from all directions equally\nwell. This lens establishes a classic example of non-Euclidean transformation optics\n[4, 5, 6, 7] where light in a medium is experiencing a curved spatial geometry [3].\nLuneburg lenses are applied in microwave technology [8, 9, 10] but have remained\nimpossible to implement in optics. Here we demonstrate an integrated Luneburg\nlens on a silicon chip that works for near-infrared light. Such lenses may become the\nbuilding blocks of compact Fourier optics in silicon photonics [11]. The resolution\nof the Luneburg lens is limited by the wavelength of light, but our manufacturing method is also sufficiently versatile for making future perfect imaging devices\n[7, 12, 13] on silicon platforms.\nThe Luneburg lens [2, 3] is a rotationally symmetric thick lens with a spatially\nvarying refractive-index profile that focuses light on the rim of the lens (Fig. 1). The\nfocal point lies in the direction of the incident light; the lens thus turns the direction\nof a light ray into the position of the focus. In terms of light waves [1], it performs\na Fourier transformation. Because of its rotational symmetry, the Luneburg lens is\nan ideal lens free from optical aberrations [1], but it is not a perfect lens [13, 14]: its\nfocus size is limited by the wavelength of light [15] (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, it could\nbecome an important optical instrument, in particular in integrated photonics, if it\nwere possible to make Luneburg lenses. The required index profile n of the lens is\ncurrently impossible to create by doping optical materials, as the profile is given by\nthe formula [3]\nq\nn = 2 \u2212 (r/a)2 for r \u2264 a\n(1)\n\n1\n\n\fwhere r denotes the distance from the centre of the lens and a its outer radius.\nLuneburg's\n\u221a formula (1) shows that one needs to create an index profile with a contrast of 2 \u2248 1.4, which is far from the reach of current doping techniques.\nWe have made a Luneburg lens in silicon photonics [11]. There light is typically\nconfined in waveguiding structures on planar silicon chips. Instead of doping, one\ncan exploit the three-dimensional nature of the waveguide to create an effective\nindex profile for two-dimensional wave propagation on the chip. In our case, the\nLuneburg lens is a thin graded silicon disk (less than 70nm thick) of 98\u03bcm radius\nput between a 2\u03bcm silica layer on a silicon substrate and an SU8 polymer layer on\ntop (Fig. 2a). The total thickness of the silicon disk and the polymer is fixed to be\n500nm. We exploit the fact that the effective refractive index in a waveguide depends\non its geometric dimensions. As the thickness of the silicon disk is only gradually\nchanging compared with the wavelength, we can find the local refractive index n\nassuming a simple model: a planar sandwich of silicon substrate, silica, silicon layer,\npolymer and air, with each layer in the model having the local thickness of the layer\nin the actual device. Figure 2b shows the effective index n depending on the silicon\nthickness for light of 1550nm wavelength and polarized such that the magnetic field\npoints orthogonal to the layer structure (while the electric field is parallel to the\nstructure). One sees that the index range is sufficient to implement the Luneburg\nlens and other, perfectly imaging lenses such as Maxwell's fish eye [13]. Figure 2c\nshows the silicon profile of our Luneburg lens (measured with a Bruker Dektak 150\nstylus profiler) against the corresponding theoretical curve of formula (1) translated\nto a thickness profile by the relationship illustrated in Fig. 2b.\nTapered waveguides like ours have been applied before for creating effective index profiles. Early Luneburg-type lenses [16] were fabricated by sputtering [17, 18]\nbut there the index contrast was insufficient for creating the proper Luneburg lens\nwith profile (1). A crude Luneburg lens was made with a macroscopic, multimode\nwaveguide [19], but such a device is far too large to be integrated. Recently, approximate Eaton/Minano [12] and Maxwell fish eye [13] lenses were created by putting\nliquid droplets on a substrate [7], but they cannot be integrated in a solid-state\ndevice and are not fully controllable. Luneburg lenses for surface plasmons [5] were\nproposed and numerically studied [6] but not made in practice. In our case, we use\ndielectrics that are significantly less absorptive than the metals needed for plasmons.\nOne could make similar index profiles with silicon metamaterials [20, 21, 22], but\nhere scattering losses at the structures of metamaterials become a critical limitation\n[23], whereas the index profiles made by our method are continuos and sufficiently\nsmooth. With our technique one can controllably fabricate nearly arbitrary index\nprofiles within the range specified in Fig. 2b on silicon photonics platforms that can\ncombine electronics with photonics [11]. Such devices will work for infrared light\nlight in the telecom band and can form the building blocks of on-chip Fourier optics.\nFor fabricating our Luneburg lens we used grey-scale electron-beam lithography\n[24, 25]. First, the prefabricated silicon on insulator chip (2\u03bcm silica, 220nm silicon\ncapping layer) was cleaned in acetone and IPA in an ultrasonic bath and ashed with\noxygen plasma. SU8 resist of 350nm thickness was then spun and soft-baked for\n1min at 60o C followed by 4min at 100o C. For the grey-scale lithography we used a\n\n2\n\n\fLEO-RAITH modified electron beam with a positional accuracy of 2nm. The resist\nwas exposed at 30kV with a dose ranging from 0 to 10\u03bcAs/cm2 . Particular care\nhad to be exercised in choosing the dose profile that produces the required silicon\nprofile. We found empirically that a dose D with profile Dmax (1 \u2212 r/a)1/2 results in\nthe Luneburg profile shown in Fig. 2c. After exposure the sample was developed with\nEC for 45s and hard-baked for 10min at 180o C. We transferred the gray-scale profile\nto the silicon via Reactive Ion Etching, using a blend of O2:SF6:CHF3=75:100:100\nat 20W for 90s. Finally the chip was spin coated with a layer of SU8 polymer\nwith a maximum thickness of 500nm, soft-baked, exposed for 1min to UV light and\nhard-baked to cross-link and stabilize the polymer. The sample was then cleaved\nfor end-fire coupling (where we couple light in from the side).\nAfter fabrication, we tested the optical performance of our Luneburg lens. The\nexperimental measurements were performed via end-fire coupling. The beam from\na C+L band amplified spontaneous emission source (centre wavelength 1575nm,\nbandwidth 110nm) was polarized (with the electric field parallel to the top surface\nof the device) and focused with a 10X objective on the facet of the sample. The\nbeam was free to diffract in the planar waveguide until it enters the Luneburg\nlens. We observed the Luneburg lens from the top with a 50X Mitutoyo objective\nlens, with a numerical aperture of 0.55, and the image was taken by a Vidicon\nElectrophysics MicronViewer Camera (Spectral Response: 0.4\u03bcm to 1.9\u03bcm). We\nsaw a strong intensity peak at the focal spot (that originates from the focused\ninfrared light scattered at small imperfections). To make the lens visible in our image\nwe illuminated the device with an independent white LED. All the measurements\ntaken with the camera were calibrated using the known radius a of the lens, as\nmeasured independently with the profiler (Fig. 1c). Figure 3a shows the image\nacquired with the camera in false color. The light comes from the right hand side.\nThe red spot is the focused infrared light, while the outline of the lens appears\nsolely due the independent white LED illumination. From this figure, it is possible\nto measure the spot size in the two marked directions (Fig. 3b).\nThe measured minimum spot size is 3.77\u03bcm. We expect from theory (Fig. 1)\nthat the focal spot is about half a wavelength in size, but in our experiment it was\nwider. Several factors could contribute to the spot size - the optical resolution\nof the microscope used in combination with the propagation in the polymer layer,\nthe geometrical dispersion of the lens (as we used a broad band of wavelengths),\nscattering due to roughness and the finite width of the incident beam. The latter\naspect turns out to account for the observed broadening. The input beam was not a\nplane wave but a Gaussian beam. The input waist was measured to be approximately\n12\u03bcm. The Luneburg lens was a distance of 1.5mm away from the chip facet, which\nmeans that (assuming a Gaussian beam profile) the beam reached the lens with\nangles between -1.1 and +1.1 degrees, with a resulting arclenght of 3.8\u03bcm, which\nagrees with the measured focus size in our Luneburg lens.\nWe have performed further experiments to characterize the behavior of our\nLuneburg lens. In particular we launched light on the lens at different angles,\nto show that the lens effectively implements a spatial Fourier transform. Figure\n4 shows three cases with tilting angle +4, 0 and -4 degrees in panel a), b) and c),\n\n3\n\n\frespectively. We see that the lens focuses equally well from all directions. We also\ndisplaced the input beam with respect to the central axis of the lens, see panels d)\nand e) of Fig. 4. Recall that the beam size was smaller than the lens itself. Remarkably, the focused spot still appeared in the middle of the lens, confirming that\nthe lens implements a Fourier transform, as it is mostly sensitive to the direction of\npropagation rather than to the spatial distribution of the beam itself. We have thus\ndemonstrated a fully functional Luneburg lens in silicon photonics that can be used\nin integrated imaging devices. For this we exploited the three-dimensional geometric aspects of waveguides to implement refractive-index profiles for two-dimensional\nwave propagation that are normally impossible to make in optical materials.\n\nAcknowledgments\nADF is supported by an EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellowship, SCK by the University of St Andrews and UL by a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award\nand a Blue Skies Theo Murphy Award of the Royal Society.\n\nReferences\n[1] Born, M. & Wolf, E.
