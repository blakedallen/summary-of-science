An outstanding difficulty is the large\ndiscrepancy between the predicted and observed rate of the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay (1). We report here a measurement of the transition matrix element\n| M(\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ) |2 . The density of events on the Dalitz plot has been predicted to\nbe uniform by Gasser and Leutwyler (1) and by Di Vecchia (2). More recently\na calculation of Kambor, Wiesendanger and Wyler (3) found a density which\ndecreases as the distance from the center of the plot increases.\nThe Dalitz plot density is specified by a single parameter, conventionally denoted as \u03b1. Kambor et al. show that both \u03b1 and the rate \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0) are\nsensitive to a parameter of the theory ( c in their notation ). The dependence\nof \u03b1 and \u0393 on c is such that a more negative value of \u03b1 reduces the value of \u0393\nthereby increasing the disagreement with experiment. Two values of \u03b1 are determined by the authors of (3), -0.014 and -0.007, the latter containing higher\norder corrections and leading to a prediction for \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0) more consistent\nwith experiment.\nTo second order in the center of mass pion energy (4) - (7) the Dalitz plot\ndensity for the decay \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 is parameterized as\n| M|2 \u221d 1 + 2\u03b1z\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\nNow at Department of Physics, Kansas State University, Manhattan KS 66506,\nUSA\n2 Now at Department of Physics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY 12180,\nUSA\n3 Now at Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburg, PA 15213,\nUSA\n4 Permanent address: Rafael, Haifa, Israel\n5 Now at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News VA 23606,\nUSA\n6 Now at Department of Physics,University of Arizona, Tucson AZ 85721, USA\n\n2\n\n\fwith\n3\n2X\n3Ei \u2212 m\u03b7\nz=\n3 i=1 m\u03b7 \u2212 3m\u03c00\n\n!2\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1max\n\n!2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ei is the energy of the i'th pion in the \u03b7 rest frame, \u03c1 is the distance\nfrom the center of the Dalitz plot and \u03c1max the largest kinematically allowable\nvalue of \u03c1.\nA uniformly populated Dalitz plot, (as predicted by (1) and (2)) gives \u03b1 = 0. \u03b1\nhas been measured previously by Baglin et al. (5) , Alde et al. (6) , and Abele et\nal. (7). Recent results are shown in figure 1 along with the result of this work.\nReference (7) finds a value significantly different from zero and in probable\ndisagreement (2\u03c3) with theoretical expectations. The results reported in (5)\nand (6) are consistent with both zero and the non-zero expectation of (3).\n\nFig. 1. Previous measurements of \u03b1 and the result of this work with a comparison\nto recent theoretical predictions. Not shown is the result of reference (5).\n\nIn this work we report on a determination of \u03b1 from the decay \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 where\nthe \u03b7 was produced by 18.3 GeV/c negative pions incident on liquid hydrogen. The data were collected in 1995 by the Brookhaven National Laboratory\nE852 collaboration. The apparatus has been described previously (8),(9) and\nconsisted of a large, segmented lead glass calorimeter (LGD), charged particle\ntracking, veto and trigger systems capable of determining the charged particle\nmultiplicity and the total energy deposited in the lead glass.\n3\n\n\fThe data used for this analysis were collected with the \"all-neutral\" trigger\nwhich required no charged particles, an energy deposition greater than 12 GeV\nin the lead glass and no photons in the downstream photon veto.\n\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decays were selected by requiring exactly 6 reconstructed clusters in\nthe LGD and a visible total energy greater than 16.5 GeV. All combinations of\nassignments to the hypothesis 3\u03c0 0 were tested and if the best \u03c72 corresponded\nto a confidence level greater than 1% the event was considered a candidate.\nA preliminary fit using only the \u03c0 0 mass constraint was performed to allow\nevaluation of the 3\u03c0 0 effective mass. Figure 2 shows the resulting distribution.\nEvents with a mass less than 0.65 GeV/c2 (corresponding to 3\u03c3 from the \u03b7\nmass) were subjected to a full kinematic fit with the hypothesis \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03b7n;\n\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 . A confidence level (CL) cut selected decays for the final analysis.\nIt also was required that no photon have an energy less than 0.25 GeV and\nthat the minimum separation between photons be larger than 9 cm. The effect\nand purpose of these requirements is discussed below. The final resulting data\nset contained 87,500 events.\nTo determine \u03b1, eq. 1 is fitted to the observed distribution of z corrected\nfor acceptance and phase space dependence. The acceptance correction was\nbased on Monte-Carlo simulation, taking into account the apertures of the\napparatus and a large sample of GEANT generated electromagnetic showers.\nThe requirements on the minimum photon energy and the minimum allowable photon separation mentioned above removed any uncertainties in the\nMonte-Carlo simulation associated with the transverse development of electromagnetic showers and the behavior of low energy photons. The separation\nrequirement also selected events where the nearest two electromagnetic showers were well resolved. The phase space dependence of z was removed by dividing the observed distribution by the distribution due to a uniformly populated\nDalitz plot.\nThe distribution resulting from removing the phase space dependence and\ncorrecting for the acceptance is proportional to M 2 and is shown in figure 3\nalong with the result of the fit to eq. 1. The distribution has been numerically\nscaled to give a proportionality constant of one. Our result is \u03b1 = \u22120.0047 \u00b1\n0.0074, where the error is statistical only.\nSystematic effects have been considered and the important contributors identified. Since \u03b1 is a static property of the \u03b7 a measurement of \u03b1 cannot depend\non any data selection requirement, for example, momentum-transfer, separation of photons in the detector, photon energy detection thresholds, confidence\nlevel of fits, etc. It was observed that our measured \u03b1 remained constant as a\nfunction of the Confidence Level (CL) cut, down to about CL = 30%, below\nwhich \u03b1 began to fall slightly. This is consistent with an increasing contribu4\n\n\f2\n\nEvents per 0.010 GeV/c\n\n40000\n30000\n\n10\n\n4\n\n20000\n10000\n0\n\n10\n\n0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7\n\n3\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n2\n\n3\u03c0 effective mass, GeV/c\n\nFig. 2.

It was required the an event have a confidence level greater than 30% for\nthis analysis. Studies of the variation of \u03b1 with the value chosen for the CL\ncut yielded an estimate of \u00b10.003 for the systematic contribution associated\nwith this cut.\nThe analysis further required that no two photons have reconstructed impact\npositions closer than 9 cm, a distance denoted by \u2206r. Variation of the value of\n\u2206r used in the analysis between 8.5 and 11 cm yielded our estimate of \u00b10.002\nfor the contribution to the systematic error due to this effect.\nThe effect of requiring the lowest energy photon to have an energy larger\nthan 0.25 GeV was investigated by removing this requirement (increasing the\ndata set by 1,140 events) and by replacing it with a requirement of 0.5 GeV\n(decreasing the data set by 15,230 events). A contribution of \u00b10.001 to the\nsystematic error was found.\n5\n\n\fAcceptance (%)\n\n1.05\n1\n0.95\n\n2\n\n|M| (arbitrary units)\n\n1.1\n\n14\n\n0.9\n0.85\n\n12\n0.8\n\n10\n0.75\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\n8\n\nZ\nFig. 3.

Open squares: the experimental\nacceptance as a function of z.\n\nFor 20% of the events in the data sample it was possible to choose more\nthan one assignment of photons to pions. The analysis presented here chose\nthe assignment with the best confidence level. The effect of this choice was\nstudied by choosing the second best assignment (when possible) and by using\nall assignments with an appropriate weight to calculate \u03b1. No statistically\nsignificant differences were observed.\nFinally, the data set was divided into two statistically independent halves by\nexperimental run numbers and, separately, by range of momentum transfers.\nIn both cases, the values determined for \u03b1 were not statistically significantly\ndifferent leading us to conclude these selections do not contribute to our systematic error. All effects considered combine to give our final estimate of\n\u00b10.004 for the systematic error.\n\n6\n\n\f2\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have measured the \u03b1 parameter of the transition matrix element M(\u03b7 \u2192\n3\u03c0 0 ) to be \u03b1 = \u22120.005 \u00b1 0.007 (stat) \u00b1 0.004 (syst). Our result differs from\none of the previous measurements (7) by slightly more than 2\u03c3 but is consistent with several other (6), (5) measurements. When compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the value of zero favored by Di Vecchia, Gasser and Leutwyler\n(1) , (2),cannot be ruled out. The result reported here is consistent with the\ntwo values (-0.007 and -0.014) reported by Kambor, Wiesendanger and Wyler\n(3).\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nJ.
