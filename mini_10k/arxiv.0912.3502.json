The\nexplicit analysis of the weak to strong coupling crossover of this model has also set a precise benchmark\nfor approximate many-body techniques [1, 2]. The efforts done for the computation of the correlation\nfunctions of the LL model have also greatly stimulated the development of new and general formalisms,\nsuch as the quantum inverse scattering method [4] or the bosonization approach [5].\nNowadays a renewed interest in the LL model has been triggered by its accurate experimental realization\n[6\u20139]: in quasi one-dimensional traps, the excitations in the transverse directions are effectively frozen\nand, moreover, the coupling of the ultracold bosons to the external environment can be made very weak\n[10]. These recent experimental advances have opened new perspectives in the field of strongly correlated\nquantum systems: in such a highly controllable set-up it is, in fact, possible to thoroughly investigate\nproblems of general nature concerning quantum extended systems, such as the dynamics of integrable\nsystems in the presence of small non-integrable perturbations [11] (e.g., three-body interactions and/or a\nweak external trapping potential), the issue of thermalization in quantum integrable and non-integrable\nsystems [12] and the behavior of various susceptibilities and response functions.\nThe key quantities to answer all these questions are the correlation functions of the LL model. Despite\nthe integrability of the model, their explicit computation turned out to be an interesting theoretical\nchallenge . For this reason many different approaches have been developed over the years to tackle\ndifferent aspects of this difficult problem: a partial list includes bosonization (which gives the correct longdistance behavior of correlation functions) [5, 13, 14], quantum Monte Carlo simulations [15], algebraic\nBethe Ansatz [16], analytical-numerical methods based on the exact Bethe Ansatz solution [17, 18],\nBogoliubov weak- [19] and strong-coupling methods [20], renormalization group [21], numerical results\nusing stochastic wave-functions [22] and imaginary time simulations [23, 24]. Exact results based on the\nYang\u2013Yang equations and the Hellmann\u2013Feynman theorem are presently available for local two-body\ncorrelations [20, 25], while the local three-body correlations were determined at zero temperature in [26].\nA new method was proposed recently to compute expectation values in the LL model [27]: it exploits\na different route from all the previous approaches for it is based on an exact mapping between the\nnon-relativistic LL model and the relativistic integrable Sinh\u2013Gordon (sh-G) model. This proposal not\nonly provides a remarkable simplification of the problem but applies equally well both at zero and finite\ntemperatures. In a nutshell, the logical steps on which the method is based are the following:\n1. Due to the relativistic invariance and quantum integrability of the Sh-G model, it is possible to set\nup functional equations [28, 29] for the matrix elements of its local operators on the asymptotic\nstates \u2013 known as form factors \u2013 and to find their exact solutions [30, 31].\n2. The finite temperature and finite density effects of the Sh-G model can also be controlled by solving\nthe Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations [32, 33].\n\n\f2\n3. In a proper non-relativistic limit of the sh-G model, all quantities of this theory \u2013 S-matrix, Lagrangian, form factors, TBA equations and so on \u2013 reduce to those of the LL model and therefore\ncan be used to establish an explicit mapping between the two models. In particular, from the exact\nand known expressions of the form factors of the sh-G model we can explicitly obtain the matrix\nelements of the operators of the LL model we are interested in.\n4. To actually compute the LL correlation functions we have to take into account another aspect of\nthe problem, that is, that the LL correlation functions refer to the ground state of the gas at a\nfinite density and at a finite temperature, while those of the sh-G model refer to the vacuum state\n(i.e. the state without any particles). This apparent difficulty can be, however, readily overcome by\nusing the LeClair\u2013Mussardo formalism [34] that, as a matter of fact, is based on the same quantities\nmentioned above, i.e., the form factors and the TBA equations.\nIn this paper we provide the details of the mapping between the sh-G and the LL models first established\nin [27], presenting additional results and focusing values. The paper is organized as follows: in Section\nII we introduce the LL and sh-G models and we recall their TBA equations. In Section III we discuss\nthe form factors of the sh-G model and their correspondence with the operators of the theory. In Section\nIV we explore in detail the non-relativistic regime of the sh-G model and we explain how the LL model\nemerges in this limit: the mapping between the two models is discussed at the level of their S-matrices,\nLagrangians and TBA equations. In Section V we describe the method of calculating local correlation\nfunctions in the LL model, providing a detailed derivation of the main result, formula (100). Then we\npresent the explicit computation of LL one-point correlators at zero and finite temperatures, together\nwith their comparison with known exact and approximate results available in literature. Our conclusion\nand outlooks are given in Section VI. Supplementary material is presented in the Appendices, where we\nalso list the non-relativistic limit of the sh-G form factors for the first few cases.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODELS\n\nIn this section we recall the main properties of the LL and sh-G models and we also discuss the expressions\nof their free energy and T = 0 ground-state energy obtained by the TBA equations.\n\nA.\n\nLieb\u2013Liniger Hamiltonian\n\nThe LL Hamiltonian describes N non-relativistic bosons of mass m in one dimension, interacting via a\ntwo-body repulsive \u03b4-potential:\nH=\u2212\n\nN\nX\n~2 X \u2202 2\n+ 2\u03bb\n\u03b4(xi \u2212 xj ) .\n2\n2m i=1 \u2202xi\ni<j\n\n(1)\n\nFor cold atomic gases the quantity \u03bb > 0 in the Hamiltonian (1) can be determined in terms of the parameters of the three-dimensional Bose gas in the quasi-one-dimensional limit [10]. The effective coupling\nconstant of the LL model is given by the dimensionless quantity\n\u03b3=\n\n2m\u03bb\n,\n~2 n\n\n(2)\n\nwhere n = N/L is the density of the gas (L is the length of the system). The limit \u03b3 \u001c 1 is the weak\ncoupling limit and in this regime it is known that the Bogoliubov approximation \u2013 obtained by linearizing\nthe Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation \u2013 gives a good estimate of the ground-state energy of the system [1]. For\nlarge \u03b3 one approaches the Tonks\u2013Girardeau limit [35] and recently it has become an interesting question,\nalso from the experimental point of view, to study the crossover between the two regimes [2]. In the LL\nmodel temperatures are usually expressed in units of the quantum degeneracy temperature\nkB TD =\n\n~2 n 2\n,\n2m\n\nin the following we use the scaled temperature \u03c4 = T /TD .\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nIn second quantized formalism the non-relativistic field theory describing bosons interacting via a\n\u03b4-potential is defined by the Hamiltonian [4]\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\n~ \u2202\u03c8 \u2020 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2020 \u2020\nH =\ndx\n+ \u03bb \u03c8 \u03c8 \u03c8\u03c8 ,\n(4)\n2m \u2202x \u2202x\nwhere the complex Bose field \u03c8(x, t) satisfies the canonical commutation relations\n[\u03c8(x, t), \u03c8 \u2020 (x0 , t)] = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ) ,\n\n[\u03c8(x, t), \u03c8(x0 , t)] = 0 .\n\nThe Lagrangian density associated to the field theory Hamiltonian H is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8 \u2020\n~2 \u2202\u03c8 \u2020 \u2202\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2020\n\u2212\n\u03c8 \u2212\n\u2212 \u03bb \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8\u03c8 .\nL=i\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x \u2202x\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nRestricting to the subspace of the Hilbert space where the number of particles N is fixed, the equation\nof motion for the field \u03c8 translates into the eigenvalue equation of the LL many-body Hamiltonian (1):\nH \u03c7N (x1 , . . . , xN ) = EN \u03c7N (x1 , . . . , xN ) .\n\n(7)\n\nAs shown by Lieb and Liniger in their original paper [1], the eigenvalue problem (7) can be solved in\nterms of a Bethe Ansatz. Let us recall the main steps because they will lead us to the definition of the\nS-matrix of the LL model, a basic quantity of its dynamics and of our following discussion. One can easily\nsee that Eq. (7) is just a free Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the domain where the coordinates of the particles\nare all distinct. However, we have to enforce the usual boundary conditions for a \u03b4-function potential,\nthat is, the discontinuity of the gradient of the wave function when two coordinates coincide\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n~2\n\u2212\n\u03c7N |xj =xk +\u000f = \u03bb \u03c7N |xj =xk .\n(8)\n2m \u2202xj\n\u2202xk\nIf we denote by R1 the subset of the configuration space where x1 < x2 < * * * < xN , the solution of the\nequations in R1 is given by the Bethe wave function\nPN\nX\ni\n(9)\n\u03c7N (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) =\na(P ) e ~ j=1 P (kj )xj ,\nP\n\nP\n\nwhere P denotes a sum over permutations of the momenta {k1 , . . . , kn } that characterize the state.\nFor configurations outside R1 the solution is easily obtained using the symmetry of \u03c7N with respect to\nthe xi . The coefficients in the sum are related by the boundary conditions (8). For the permutations\nP : (k, l, k\u03b13 , . . . , k\u03b1N ) and Q : (l, k, k\u03b13 , . . . , k\u03b1N ) the relation between the corresponding coefficients is\na(Q) =\n\nk \u2212 l \u2212 i 2m\n~ \u03bb\na(P ) .\n2m\nk\u2212l+i ~ \u03bb\n\n(10)\n\nHence the wave function gets multiplied by the factor a(Q)/a(P ) whenever two particles with momenta\np1 = k and p2 = l are exchanged. This exchange is equivalent to a scattering process of the two particles\nand therefore the two-body S-matrix of the Lieb\u2013Liniger model is expressed by\nSLL (p, \u03bb) =\n\np \u2212 i 2m\n~ \u03bb\n,\n2m\np+i ~ \u03bb\n\n(11)\n\nwhere p = p1 \u2212 p2 is the momentum difference.\nGiven the integrability of the model, all its physical properties can be essentially derived from its twobody S-matrix (11). This quantity, for instance, determines the thermodynamics of the model, as shown\noriginally by Yang and Yang [3]. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, L \u2192 \u221e with the density n fixed, the discrete\nenergy levels of the system get encoded in an energy level density function \u03c1\u0303(p) and in the density \u03c1\u0303(r) (p)\nof the occupied levels. Notice that we are going to use a tilde \u0303 for the quantities in the non-relativistic LL\nTBA, while the corresponding quantities in the TBA for the sh-G model will be later denoted without\nthis tilde. The ratio between the two densities \u03c1\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303(r) defines the pseudo-energy \u03b5\u0303(p) through the\nrelation\n\u03c1\u0303(p)\n= 1 + e\u03b5\u0303(p) ,\n\u03c1\u0303(r) (p)\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\nand this quantity, together with the densities, satisfies the coupled set of integral equations\n2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0303(p) =\n\n1\n+\n~\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndp0 \u03c6\u0303(p \u2212 p0 ) \u03c1\u0303(r) (p0 ) ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03bc\u0303\np2\n\u03b5\u0303(p) = \u2212\n+\n\u2212\nkB T\n2mkB T\nZ\u221e\nn=\n\n(13a)\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n0\ndp0\n\u03c6\u0303(p \u2212 p0 ) log 1 + e\u2212\u03b5\u0303(p ) ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(13b)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c1\u0303(r) (p) dp ,\n\n(13c)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303 is the chemical potential, T is the temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant.

In Section IV C we show that the TBA equations and the\nexcitation spectrum of the LL model can be obtained in a proper limit from those of the sh-G model.\n\nB.\n\nThe Sinh\u2013Gordon model\n\nThe sh-G model is an integrable relativistically invariant field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions defined by the\nLagrangian density\n1\nL=\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03c6\nc \u2202t\n\n\u00132\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x\n\n\u00132\n\u2212\n\nm20 c2\n(cosh(g\u03c6) \u2212 1) ,\ng 2 ~2\n\n(18)\n\n\f5\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03c6(x, t) is a real scalar field, m0 is a mass scale and c is the speed of light. The parameter m0\nis related to the physical (renormalized) mass M of the particle by [36]\nm20 = M 2\n\n\u03c0\u03b1\n.\nsin(\u03c0\u03b1)\n\n(19)\n\nThe explicit presence of the speed of light c will help us in studying later the non-relativistic limit of this\ntheory (see Section IV). Despite the relativistic nature of the sh-G model, its integrability (supported\nby the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws) implies the absence of particle production\nprocesses and that its n-particle scattering amplitudes are purely elastic. Moreover, they factorize into\nn(n \u2212 1)/2 two-body S-matrices. The energy E and the momentum P of a particle can be written as\nE = M c2 cosh \u03b8, P = M c sinh \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the rapidity. In terms of the particle rapidities, the two-body\nS-matrix is given by [37]:\nsinh \u03b8 \u2212 i sin(\u03b1\u03c0)\n,\nsinh \u03b8 + i sin(\u03b1\u03c0)\n\nSsh-G (\u03b8, \u03b1) =\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the rapidity difference and \u03b1 is the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant\n~c g 2\n.\n8\u03c0 + ~c g 2\n\n\u03b1 =\n\n(21)\n\nAs in the LL model, the two-body S-matrix of the sh-G model fully encodes its physical properties,\nin particular its thermodynamics. Its derivation is quite similar to the one of the LL model, the only\ndifference being the relativistic kinematics [32, 33]. Let us briefly discuss the TBA equations of the sh-G\nmodel both at finite temperature and at finite particle density n. Note initially that, although the sh-G\nmodel is a relativistic theory, its quantum integrability implies the conservation of the number of particles\nand therefore it makes sense to associate a wave-function to the N -particle state. Therefore, the starting\npoint of the TBA approach is the quantization of the rapidities of the N -particle state on an interval L\nwith periodic boundary conditions, given by\nM cL sinh \u03b8i + ~\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c7(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) = 2\u03c0Ni ~ ,\n\n(22)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere the Ni are (positive or negative) integers and \u03c7(\u03b8) = \u2212i log Ssh-G (\u03b8) is the phase shift of the twobody scattering process of the sh-G model. In the thermodynamic limit (N \u2192 \u221e, L \u2192 \u221e, N/L = n =\nfixed) we introduce for the left hand side of Eqs.

Due to the non-zero chemical potential, we\ncan assume that the function \u03b5(\u03b8) changes sign at the rapidity values \u2212\u03b8\u2217 and \u03b8\u2217 so that it is negative\non the interval I \u2261 (\u2212\u03b8\u2217 , \u03b8\u2217 ), zero at the limiting points and positive everywhere else. For T \u2192 0, \u03b5(\u03b8)\nbecomes largely negative on the interval I and largely positive outside. Then from Eq.

If we raise one of the numbers Ni in\nthe Bethe equation that corresponds to a rapidity \u03b8i , to a larger value Ni0 , which will correspond to a\nrapidity \u03b80 , then the change in the energy of the system is\n\u2206E = kB T (\u03b5(\u03b80 ) \u2212 \u03b5(\u03b8)) .\n\n(34)\n\nThis shows that \u03b5(\u03b8) describes the energy of the excitations over the ground state, and it gives the dressed\nenergy of the quasi-particles (hence the name pseudo-energy).

In the latter context they are defined as matrix elements of operators between exact\nBethe ansatz states, while here we use instead the basis in the Hilbert space consisting of multiparticle\nscattering states. However, these quantities turn out to be closely related [38]. In this section, for the sake\nof completeness, we first review the definition and the main properties of the form factors in a general\nrelativistic field theory. Since our final goal is to treat the sh-G model which is a theory with a single\ntype of gapped excitations and multi-particle states without any bound states, we focus our attention on\ntheories of this type. (A well-known example of a theory with different types of excitations and bound\nstates is the Sine\u2013Gordon model [39].) Later we present the explicit expressions of the form factors of the\nsh-G model.\nA.\n\nBasic properties of form factors\n\u03bc\n\nConsider a local operator O(x, t). Using the translation operator U = e\u2212ip\u03bc x , where t = x0 and x = x1 ,\nwe can always shift this operator to the origin O(x, t) = U \u2020 O(0, 0)U . The matrix elements of O(0, 0)\nbetween the vacuum and a set of n-particle asymptotic states are called the n-particle form factors of\nthis operator (see Fig. 1)\nFnO (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8n ) = h0|O(0, 0)|\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n i .\n\n(37)\n\nFor an operator of spin s, relativistic invariance implies that under a simultaneous shift in the rapidities\nits form factors behave as\nFnO (\u03b81 + \u039b, . . . , \u03b8n + \u039b) = es\u039b FnO (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) .\n\n(38)\n\nThis equation indicates that the form factors of a scalar operator depend only on the differences of\nrapidities, \u03b8ij = \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j . A generic matrix element of the operator O(0, 0) can be expressed in terms of\nits form factors by using the translation operator and the crossing symmetry, which is implemented by\nan analytic continuation in the rapidity variables\nO\nh\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n |O(0, 0)|\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m i = Fn+m\n(\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m , \u03b81 \u2212 i\u03c0, . . . , \u03b8n \u2212 i\u03c0) .\n\n(39)\n\n(If \u03b2i = \u03b8j for some i and j, this formula gets modified by contact terms.) Hence, the knowledge of all\nform factors of an operator is equivalent to the knowledge of the operator itself, (i.e., how it acts on any\nstate of the theory).\nThe form factors satisfy a set of functional and recursive equations, which for integrable models makes\nit possible to find in many cases their explicit expressions (for a review, see [28, 40]). For a scalar operator\nthe functional equations (known as Watson equations [29]) come from unitarity and crossing symmetry\nand their explicit expressions are\nFn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8i , \u03b8i+1 , . . . , \u03b8n ) = S(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i+1 ) Fn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8i+1 , \u03b8i , . . . , \u03b8n ) ,\nn\nY\nFn (\u03b81 + 2\u03c0i, . . . , \u03b8n ) =\nS(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b81 ) Fn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) .\ni=2\n\n(40a)\n(40b)\n\n\f8\nO\n\nO\n\n=\n\nS\n\nO\n\n=\n\nO\n\nFIG. 2: Graphical form of the Watson equations.\n\nTheir graphical representations are given in Fig. 2.\nThe recursive equations, on the other hand, come from the pole structure of one-particle intermediate\nstates. The form factors of integrable theories have, in general, two kinds of simple poles in the strip\n0 < Im \u03b8ij < 2\u03c0 and except for these singularities they are analytic in the strip. The first kind of poles\ncorresponds to kinematical singularities at \u03b8ij = i\u03c0 and their residues give rise to a set of recursive\nequations between the n-particle and the n + 2-particle form factors (see Fig. 3)\n!\nn\nY\n\u2212 i Res Fn+2 (\u03b8\u0303 + i\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) = 1 \u2212\nS(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8i ) Fn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) .\n(41)\n\u03b8\u0303=\u03b8\n\ni=1\n\nThe second kind of poles is instead related to the bound states of the theory. Since there are no bound\nstates in the sh-G model, there are no such poles in the form factors of this theory and we do not need\nto write here the corresponding residue equations.\nThe general solution of the Watson equations (40) can be written as\nFn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) = Kn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n )\n\nn\nY\n\nFmin (\u03b8ij ) ,\n\n(42)\n\ni<j\n\nwhere the factors Kn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) are completely symmetric and 2\u03c0i-periodic functions in all \u03b8i , and\nFmin (\u03b8) is an analytic function in 0 \u2264 Im \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 (without zeros and poles in this strip) which tends to a\nconstant value for large values of \u03b8. This function satisfies the equations\nFmin (\u03b8) = S(\u03b8) Fmin (\u2212\u03b8) ,\nFmin (i\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) = Fmin (i\u03c0 + \u03b8) ,\n\n(43a)\n(43b)\n\nand its role is to take care of the monodromy properties of the form factors as ruled by the Watson\nequations. The equations (43) and the analyticity requirement of Fmin are able to fix this function up\nto normalization, as we will see explicitly for the sh-G model. The factors Kn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) in (42) must\ncontain all the expected kinematical poles. In addition, they must fulfill the proper asymptotic behavior.\nThis yields the following final parametrization of the generic n-particle form factor\nFn (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) = Hn Qn (x1 , . . . , xn )\n\nn\nY\nFmin (\u03b8ij )\ni<j\n\nxi + xj\n\nS\nFn\n\nF\n\nn \u22122\n\nFIG. 3: Recursive equation of the kinematical poles.\n\n,\n\n(44)\n\n\f9\nwhere Hn is a normalization factor, xi = e\u03b8i and Qn (x1 , . . . , xn ) is a symmetric polynomial. In view\nof Eq. (38),Qthe polynomial Qn of a scalar operator has the total degree equal to the degree of the\npolynomial i<j (xi + xj ) in the denominator, n(n \u2212 1)/2.

We show that it is\npossible to obtain the LL model from the sh-G model by taking the non-relativistic limit simultaneously\nwith the limit g \u2192 0, where g is the sh-G coupling constant. In particular, we show how this mapping is\nrealized at the level of the S-matrix, the Lagrangian densities and the Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz\nequations.\n\n\f12\nA.\n\nDouble limit of the two-particle S-matrix\n\nLet us consider the exact S-matrix of the sh-G model\nSsh-G (\u03b8, \u03b1) =\n\nsinh \u03b8 \u2212 i sin(\u03b1\u03c0)\n,\nsinh \u03b8 + i sin(\u03b1\u03c0)\n\n(67)\n\nand let us take its non-relativistic limit accompanied by a simultaneous limit of the coupling constant g\ntoward smaller values such that\nc \u2192 \u221e , g \u2192 0,\n\ng c = fixed .\n\n(68)\n\nThe resulting expression\nS(\u03b8, \u03b1) \u2212\u2192\n\np\nMc\np\nMc\n\n\u2212\n+\n\ni~ 2\n8 g c\ni~ 2\n8 g c\n\n(69)\n\ncoincides with the LL S-matrix (11) once we set the sh-G and LL masses equal, M = m, and\n~2 c2 2\ng .\n(70)\n16\nHence the S-matrices of the two models coincide in this double limit. It is worth noticing that the resulting\ncoupling \u03bb of the LL model does not need to be small and therefore we shall be able to study the LL\nmodel at arbitrarily large values of its coupling. To use this correspondence between the two models to\ncalculate correlation functions in the LL model, we need to establish the relation between the operators\nof these two theories. For this reason in the next section we show how to perform the limit (68) on the\nfields and the Hamiltonians.\n\u03bb\u2261\n\nB.\n\nNon-relativistic limit at the Lagrangian level\n\nConsider the sh-G Lagrangian density\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u00132\n1 \u2202\u03c6\n1 \u2202\u03c6\nm2 c2\nL=\n\u2212\n\u2212 20 2 (cosh(g \u03c6) \u2212 1) .\n2 c \u2202t\n2 \u2202x\ng ~\n\n(71)\n\nTo study its non-relativistic limit, it is convenient to write initially the real scalar field in the form [47\u201350]\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm0 c2\nm0 c2\n~2\n(72)\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\u03c8(x, t) e\u2212i ~ t + \u03c8 \u2020 (x, t)e+i ~ t .\n2m0\nSubstituting this expression into the Lagrangian (71) and taking the limit c \u2192 \u221e, we can discard all the\n2\noscillating terms, that is, terms containing factors ei nm0 c /~ t (with n non-vanishing positive or negative\nintegers).

It is worth observing the different behaviors of the excitation energies in the two\nmodels. As it can be seen from the TBA equation (29), the sh-G energy has a gap M that implies that\nthe correlation functions decay exponentially. On the contrary, the LL excitation energy starts as p2 /2m\nfor small momenta (see Eq. (90b)), implying a power-law decay for the correlation functions. Our double\nlimit takes care of this difference automatically and thus it will give correct results for the LL model.\nV.\n\nLOCAL CORRELATORS FOR THE LIEB\u2013LINIGER MODEL\n\nIn this section we calculate LL one-point correlation functions at fixed particle density n and temperature\nT by applying the formulas of Sections II and III, in connection with the double limit presented in\nSection IV B. The fields are taken at the same position and time: since our system is taken at equilibrium\nand translationally invariant, their correlators are obviously space and time independent. We focus our\nattention on the local k-particle correlation functions gk defined as\nh\u03c8 \u2020 k \u03c8 k i = nk gk (\u03b3, \u03c4 ) ,\n\n(97)\n\nwhere \u03b3 and \u03c4 are given in (2) and (3). These local correlators play an important role in experiments with\nultracold bosons since the pair correlations are responsible for the rates of inelastic collisional processes.\nFurthermore, the low-temperature recombination rate for a Bose gas is proportional to the local threebody correlation function [51] and measurements of the three-body recombination rate can be used to\ndetermine the local correlations and as a tool for distinguishing condensed and non-condensed phases\n[52]. For g2 (\u03b3, \u03c4 ) and g3 (\u03b3, \u03c4 = 0) exact results are available [20, 25, 26], whereas for the others the\nasymptotic behavior of the correlators in the regimes of small and large coupling or temperature was\ncomputed in [20, 25]. We will present a comparison with the exact and the approximate results present in\nthe literature, showing the improvement that our method brings in the computation of these correlators.\nLet us start with the correspondence between the sh-G and the LL operators\n\u0012 2 \u0013k \u0012 \u0013\n2k\n~\nh : \u03c62k : i \u2212\u2192\nh\u03c8 \u2020 k \u03c8 k i ,\n(98)\n2m\nk\nwhich can be established along the limit procedure described in Section IV B. To compute the expectation\nvalues of these operators at finite density n of the Bose gas and at finite temperature, we need to employ\nthe results of Section III, so that\nh\u03c8\n\n\u2020k\n\nk\n\n\u03c8 i = lim\n\n\u0012\n\n2k\nk\n\n\u0013\u22121\u0012\n\n~2\n2m\n\n\u0013\u2212k X\n\u221e\nl=k\n\n1\nl!\n\nZ\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b81\nf (\u03b81 ) . . .\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2k\nd\u03b8l\nf (\u03b8l ) F2l:\u03c6 : (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8l )conn ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(99)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere f (\u03b8) = 1/(1 + e\u03b5(\u03b8) ) are the filling fractions and the notation \"lim\" denotes the double limit (68).\nNote that in Eq. (99) the terms with l < k are zero and therefore the first non-zero term in the series is\n\n\f16\na k-fold integral. Now, similarly to what happens for the TBA equations, the filling fractions effectively\ncut off the integrands at large values of the rapidities, so we can exchange the order of the limit and the\nintegrals, arriving at a fully non-relativistic formula\nh\u03c8\n\n\u2020k\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121\u0012 2 \u0013\u2212k X\nZ\u221e\nZ\u221e\n\u221e\n2k\ndp1\ndpl\n1\n2k\n~\nf (p1 ) . . .\nf (pl ) F\u03032l:\u03c6 : (p1 , . . . , pl )conn .\n\u03c8 i=\n2m\nl!\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nk\nk\n\nl=k\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(100)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHere f (p) = 1/(1 + e\u03b5\u0303(p) ) where \u03b5\u0303(p) is the solution of the non-relativistic TBA equations (90,85) and\n2k\n\nF\u03032l:\u03c6\n\n:\n\n\u0012\n({pi })conn = lim\n\n1\nmc\n\n\u0013l\n\n2k\n\nF2l:\u03c6\n\n:\n\n({\u03b8i =\n\npi\n})conn\nmc\n\n(101)\n\nare the double limit of the connected form factors.

Let us\nnow discuss in more detail the results for g1 , g2 and g3 .\n1.\n\nExpectation value g1\n\nWe already demonstrated that our series expansion sums up to the exact value g1 = 1, here we show how\nconvergent the series is. The actual computation consists of the following steps. First we solve numerically\nthe integral equation (108b), second we obtain the \u03b2(\u03b3) function from (108a), and finally, we integrate\nnumerically the dimensionless forms of the integrals on the right hand side of (105).\nCarrying out these steps for g1 = h\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8i/n, we obtain the plot shown in Fig. 4 for g1 as a function of\n\u03b3. The series (105) is nicely saturated by the first few terms for sufficiently large values of \u03b3 (one should\nkeep in mind that \u03b3 = 0 is a singular point of the LL model and therefore one cannot expect a priori\nany fast convergence nearby). In fact, this plot shows that the exact value g1 = 1 is rapidly approached\nby just the first terms of (105). It is clear that including more terms in the series, (i.e., employing higher\nparticle form factors) extends the fast convergence toward smaller values of \u03b3. Notice, however, that the\nconvergence of the series is always remarkably fast for all \u03b3 \u2265 1.5, where the exact value is obtained\nwithin a 5% accuracy just using its first four terms.\n2.\n\nExpectation value g2 (\u03b3)\n\nLet us continue our discussion with the calculation of the correlation function h\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8\u03c8i = n2 g2 .

The discrepancy between the exact\nvalue and the one obtained with four integrals is less than 3% for \u03b3 > 2.

Substituting the Boltzmann filling fraction f (\u03b8) = e\u2212\u03b5\u0303 given above, we arrive at\n\u0012\ngk (\u03b3, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03c4\n\u03b32\n\n\u0013 k(k\u22121)\n2\nJk ,\n\n(127)\n\nwhere\nJk =\n\nk!\n\u03c0 k/2\n\nZ\n\ndx1 . . . dxk e\u2212\n\nPk\n\ni=1\n\nx2i\n\nk\nY\ni<j\n\n(xi \u2212 xj )2 =\n\nBk\n2k(k\u22121)/2\n\n(128)\n\nwith Bk+1 = (k +1)\u0393(k +2)Bk , B1 = 1.

In Figs. 8 and 9 one can see how large the difference is between this\nleading order approximation and our result for \u03c4 = 10. The improvement achieved in the determination\nof this quantity by the method proposed in this paper may have an important experimental relevance.\nLet us turn now to the numerical results obtained by exactly solving the TBA equations (123), substituting \u03b5\u0303 in the formula (100) and numerically integrating the first terms in the series.

Thus we are confident about\nthe reliability of our results for g3 at T > 0, at least for not too small values of \u03b3. We emphasize that\nneither exact results nor approximations of precision comparable to ours exist in this case, which renders\nour evaluation a new result.\nFig. 9 shows g3 as a function of \u03b3 at fixed temperatures \u03c4 = 1 and \u03c4 = 10. In the figure the asymptotic\nresult (127), valid for large temperature and coupling, is also plotted: one can see that even for \u03c4 = 10\nthe result (127) does not give the exact asymptotic behavior (which is only reached for very large values\nof the scaled temperature \u03c4 ). Fig. 10 shows instead g3 as a function of \u03c4 at fixed values of \u03b3 = 7 and\n\u03b3 = 15. The asymptotic formula (127) is different from our result by a factor of \u223c 10 at \u03b3 = 7 and \u03c4 = 10.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have shown that the Lieb\u2013Liniger model, describing one-dimensional interacting bosons,\ncan be obtained as a non-relativistic limit of an integrable relativistic field theory, the Sinh\u2013Gordon\nmodel. In this limit, the S-matrix, the Lagrangian and the Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz equations of\nthe sh-G model reduce to those of the LL model. We have also shown that the pseudo-energies of the\nsh-G TBA (which are actually the energies of the excitations above the vacuum) become massless modes\nin the non-relativistic limit, in agreement with the hydro-dynamical description of the LL model given\nby bosonization.\nThe mapping between the two models proved to provide an efficient method to compute expectation\nvalues in the LL model by using the form factor expansion of the expectation values of the relativistic\ncounterpart. The main advantage of using the form factors of the relativistic integrable sh-G model is\nthat, as for any relativistic quantum field theory, its form factors obey a set of stringent constraints\nthat permits the determination of their exact expressions. Moreover, the quantum integrability of the\nrelativistic model allowed us to employ the rich collection of results valid for these systems, like the TBA\nand the LeClair\u2013Mussardo formalism.\nUsing these two formalisms of the relativistic sh-G model (form factors and TBA), we computed the\nexpectation values of the LL model. The method works equally well at T = 0 and T 6= 0 where the\nseries expansion presents a remarkable convergence behavior for finite values of the LL parameter \u03b3. The\ncomputation of one-point correlators was presented in detail, as well as the comparison with the known\nresults available in the literature. In particular, we have determined the expectation value g3 (\u03b3, \u03c4 ) at finite\ntemperature, for which there had been only asymptotic analytic results in the literature. This quantity\nis related to the recombination rate of the atomic gas and thus to the lifetime of the experiments.\nIt would be interesting to analyze the possibility of extending our method to other non-relativistic\nstrongly correlated systems, identifying their relativistic counterparts.

We start from the fourparticle form factor of the exponential operator (54):\nF4 (k) = h0|ekg\u03c6 |\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 i =\n\u0012\n\u00132\n4\n\u0001Y\n4 sin(\u03c0\u03b1)\nFmin (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )\n[k]\n, (B1)\n[k]3 \u03c31 \u03c32 \u03c33 \u2212 [k \u2212 1][k][k + 1](\u03c332 \u2212 \u03c312 \u03c34 )\nN\nxi + xj\ni<j\n(4)\n\nwhere the elementary symmetric polynomials (46) are to be understood as \u03c3k = \u03c3k and we recall that\nxi = exp(\u03b8i ) and [k] = sin(k\u03c0\u03b1)/ sin(\u03c0\u03b1). The form factor of : \u03c62 : is given by the O(k 2 ) term in the\nTaylor-expansion in k (for : \u03c62 : there is no mixing (60)):\n2\n\nF4:\u03c6 : (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 ) = \u2212\n\n4\nY\nFmin (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )\n32\u03c0 2 \u03b12 2\n2\n(\u03c3\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n)\n.\n4\n3\n1\nN 2 g2\ne\u03b8i + e\u03b8j\ni<j\n\n(B2)\n\nTo perform the connected limit (64) we first recall that the product of the minimal form factors in this\nlimit is given by (65). For the rest of the formula we write x3 = \u2212x2 + i\u03b72 , x4 = \u2212x1 + i\u03b71 and we expand\nthe polynomials in the numerator and denominator to obtain the finite part:\n\u0015\nx22 (x21 + x22 ) \u03b712 + 4x21 x22 \u03b71 \u03b72 + x21 (x21 + x22 ) \u03b722 + O(\u03b7 3 )\n\u03b71 \u21920,\u03b72 \u21920\n(x41 \u2212 2x21 x22 + x24 ) \u03b71 \u03b72 + O(\u03b7 3 )\n\u0012 2 2 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b71 \u03b72\nx21 (x21 + x22 ) \u03b72\n4x21 x22\n4x2 x2\nx22 (x21 + x22 ) \u03b71\n1\n+\n+\nO\n;\n.
