We do not rely on the assumption, made in\nmost previous work,5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 that \u03a9 \u03c4p \u226a 1.\nWe demonstrate that spin polarization decay in different regimes of momentum scattering in spin-1/2 electron\nand spin-3/2 hole systems contains considerable rich and\nnovel physics. For example, spin polarization decay has\noften been assumed to be proportional to e\u2212t/\u03c4s , where \u03c4s\nis referred to as the spin relaxation time. However, if the\nmagnitude of the spin-orbit interaction is anisotropic (as\nis usually the case in systems studied experimentally),\nspin-polarization decay can occur even in the absence\nof momentum scattering. This process is characterized\nby a non-exponential decay and is sensitive to the initial conditions, and cannot therefore be described by a\nspin relaxation time. Weak momentum scattering introduces a spin relaxation time \u03c4s \u221d \u03c4p (unlike strong momentum scattering, which gives the well-known5,7 trend\n\u03c4s \u221d \u03c4p\u22121 ), yet even in the presence of weak momentum scattering a fraction of the polarization may survive at long times. It will emerge from our work that,\nin the ballistic and weak momentum scattering regimes,\nthe concept of a spin relaxation time is of very limited\napplicability and in general does not provide an accurate\ndescription of the physics of spin polarization decay.\nWe emphasize that the results presented in this paper\nare true for (delocalized) electron spins in any nonmagnetic solid where spin-orbit coupling is important. Since\nin today's experiments mobilities range over many orders\nof magnitude, the results presented are directly relevant\nto ongoing state-of-the-art research.\nThe outline of this article is as follows. In section II we\ndiscuss the time evolution of the density matrix, deriving\nan equation which describes the return to equilibrium of\na spin polarization. We demonstrate that in the general\ncase there exists a fraction of the spin polarization which\ndoes not precess, and explain its relevance to the subsequent time evolution of the spin polarization. Section\nIII is devoted to spin-1/2 electron systems, in which first\nthe known D'yakonov-Perel' limit is discussed, then the\ncomplex situations in the ballistic and weak momentum\nscattering regimes are presented. We stress the importance of non-exponential decay and of incomplete spin\ndephasing. Finally, in the last part we demonstrate that,\nalthough spin precession is qualitatively different in spin1/2 electron and spin-3/2 hole systems, spin polarization\ndecay in these systems can be understood based on the\nsame fundamental concepts.\n\nII.\n\nTIME EVOLUTION OF THE DENSITY\nMATRIX\n\nWe assume a nonequilibrium spin polarization has\nbeen generated in a homogeneous, unstructured system\nand study its time evolution in the absence of exter-\n\nnal fields. The system is described by a density matrix,\nwhich in principle has matrix elements diagonal and offdiagonal in momentum space. Since the spin operator\nis diagonal in the wave vector k, we will only be concerned with the part of the density matrix diagonal in\nmomentum space, which is denoted by \u03c1. Henceforth, by\n\"density matrix\" we understand the part of the density\nmatrix diagonal in wave vector.\nThe spin density is given by hSi \u2261 tr S\u03c1 = tr S \u03c1\u0304,\nwhere S is the spin operator, and the overline represents\naveraging over directions in momentum space. Only the\nisotropic part \u03c1\u0304 of the density matrix is responsible for\nspin population decay.7 It is therefore convenient to divide \u03c1 into \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0304 + g, where g is the anisotropic part of\n\u03c1. Based on the quantum Liouville equation, we obtain\nan equation describing the time evolution of \u03c1 (Ref. 8),\nwhich in turn is split into a set of equations for \u03c1\u0304 and g\nsimilar to those found by Pikus and Titkov:7\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304\ni\n+ [H, g] = 0,\n\u2202t\n~\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0304\ni\ng\ni\n\u2202g\n= \u2212\n+ [H, g] +\n\u2212 [H, \u03c1\u0304].\n\u2202t\n~\n\u03c4p\n\u2202t\n~\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\nThese equations hold both for spin-1/2 electrons and for\nspin-3/2 holes. We assume elastic scattering by shortrange impurities, implying that the collision term involving \u03c1\u0304 vanishes7 and the remainder is proportional to the\ninverse of the scalar momentum relaxation time36 1/\u03c4p .\nBefore proceeding, we would like to make two remarks\nconcerning the form of the scattering term. Firstly, in\nthe presence of spin-orbit coupling both intraband and\ninterband transitions exist, while we have assumed a simplified form of the scattering term. In the version of\nthe relaxation time approximation employed in this work\nthe spin splitting of the bands is not taken into account\nin the scattering term. This approximation is justified\nby the fact that spin eigenstates are generally not energy eigenstates, and it can be straightforwardly shown,\nbased on the theory we present, that accounting explicitly for interband transitions will not change the fundamental physics of spin polarization decay, rather it will\nonly give less transparent solutions. Furthermore, spinflip scattering in nonmagnetic systems is third-order in\nthe scattering potential and/or first order in the ratio of\nthe spin-orbit splitting and the kinetic energy.\nSecondly, it should be noted that, for degenerate carriers, the return to equilibrium requires energy dissipation.\nHowever, as noted above, in a nonmagnetic material\nwith spin-orbit coupling the spin eigenstates characterizing the nonzero spin polarization are not energy eigenstates. On the other hand, unlike in, e.g., nuclear systems, the nonthermal energy characterizing this nonequilibrium configuration is essentially a kinetic energy, but\nit is not in the spin degree of freedom. Therefore, energy\ndissipation has no qualitative effect for the main conclusions in our paper.\nA solution to Eq. (1b) can be obtained by making the\ntransformation g = e\u2212iHt/~ gI eiHt/~ , which is analogous\n\n\f3\nto the customary switch to the interaction picture. This\ntransformation turns Eq.

This equation is\nthe main result of our paper. It describes the precessioninduced decay of spin polarization in all regimes of momentum scattering for any nonmagnetic solid state system with spin-orbit interactions. This equation does not\nanticipate any particular form of spin polarization decay,\nsuch as exponential decay.\nThe form of the initial density matrix \u03c10 is important and lies at the root of the novel physics discussed\nin this paper. In general \u03c10 has two contributions,\n\u03c10 = \u03c10k + \u03c10\u22a5 . The component \u03c10k commutes with H\nand is given by \u03c10k = (tr \u03c10 H/tr H 2 ) H, in a generalization of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. \u03c10\u22a5 is simply\nthe remainder, and it satisfies the condition tr \u03c10\u22a5 H = 0.\n\u03c10k is a matrix that is parallel to the Hamiltonian, and\nrepresents the fraction of the initial spin polarization that\ndoes not precess, or alternatively the fraction of the initial spins that are in eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. \u03c10\u22a5\nis orthogonal to the Hamiltonian, and represents the fraction of the initial spin polarization that does precess.\nIII.\n\nSPIN-1/2 ELECTRON SYSTEMS\n\nFirst we discuss Eq. (3) for spin-1/2 systems. The\nHamiltonian describing spin-orbit coupling has the form\nH = (~/2) \u03c3 * \u03a9(k) and \u03c1\u0304 may be decomposed as \u03c1\u0304 =\n1\n2 [n+s(t)*\u03c3], where n represents the number density and\ns(t) the spin polarization. Equation (3) has qualitatively\ndifferent solutions depending on the regime under study,\nand they are discussed in detail below.\nA.\n\nExponential decay in the strong momentum\nscattering regime\n\nA solution to Eq. (3) characterizing relaxation is understood as exponential decay of the form \u03c1\u0304(t) = e\u2212\u0393s t \u03c1\u03040 ,\nwhere \u0393s is generally a second-rank tensor that represents\nthe inverse of the spin relaxation time \u03c4s . Such a simple\nsolution of Eq. (3) does not exist in general, but for strong\nmomentum scattering (\u03a9\u03c4p \u226a 1) the RHS of Eq. (3) can\n\nbe neglected. Then substituting for \u03c1\u0304 and H in Eq. (3)\nyields the DP expression5,7 for \u0393\u0001s , which may be written as (\u0393s )ij = \u03c4p \u03a92 \u03b4ij \u2212 \u03a9i \u03a9j , where i, j = x, y, z.\nStrong momentum scattering yields exponential spin relaxation and the well-known5,7 trend \u03c4s \u221d \u03c4p\u22121 .\nB.\n\nOscillations in the ballistic regime\n\nPreviously, most analytical studies have focused on\nstrong momentum scattering.5,6,7,8,13,14,15,16,17 We will\nshow that the ballistic and weak momentum scattering regimes are far more complex.37,38,39,40 In the ballistic limit \u03c4p \u2192 \u221e and Eq. (3) can be solved exactly\nas \u03c1\u0304(t) = e\u2212iHt\u2032 /~ \u03c10\u22a5 eiHt\u2032 /~ + \u03c1\u03040k , which can also be\nobtained from the quantum Liouville equation.29 This\ndetermines the time evolution of an initial spin polarization s(t = 0) = s0 , i.e., the component of s(t) along\ns0 . For simplicity s0 is here assumed independent of k;\na k-dependent distribution would not change the results\nqualitatively. From the solution for \u03c1\u0304 in the ballistic limit\nwe have\ns(t) * \u015d0 = [1 \u2212 (\u03a9\u0302 * \u015d0 )2 ] cos \u03a9t + (\u03a9\u0302 * \u015d0 )2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u00e2 denotes the unit vector in the direction of a. The\nlast term corresponds to \u03c1\u03040k . It is best to take a concrete\nexample, such as the Hamiltonian of a 2D system on\na (001) surface with linear Rashba41 and Dresselhaus42\nspin-orbit interactions, H = \u03b1(\u03c3x ky \u2212 \u03c3y kx ) + \u03b2(\u03c3x kx \u2212\n\u03c3y ky ). We consider first effective fields \u03a9(k) such that\nthe magnitude |\u03a9(k)| does not depend on the direction of k, for example either \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b2 = 0 yields\n|\u03a9(k)| = \u03a9(k). In this case the initial spin polarization\nwill simply oscillate with frequency \u03a9. It is helpful to\nvisualize a population of spins on the Fermi surface, all\ninitially pointing up. If |\u03a9(k)| is the same at all points k\non the Fermi surface, all spins that were in phase initially\nwill be in phase again after one precession period. Some\nfraction of the initially oriented spins s0 , corresponding\nto the last term in Eq. (4), has a nonzero overlap with\nthe local field \u03a9(k) so that the projection of s0 on \u03a9(k)\nwill be preserved. This fraction is zero if the initial spin\nis out of the plane, but significant if it is in the plane.\nC.\n\nNon-exponential decay in the ballistic regime\n\nThe case when |\u03a9(k)| depends on the direction of k is\nof great relevance to experiment, where spin-orbit coupling is rarely attributable to a single mechanism. Spins\non the Fermi surface precess with incommensurable frequencies and once they are out of phase they never all\nget in phase again (but the polarization fraction due to\n\u03c10k is conserved.) In our example, if \u03b2 \u226a \u03b1 we can\np\nwrite \u03a9 \u2248 \u03a9\u0304 (1 + \u03b7 sin 2\u03c6), where \u03a9\u0304 \u2261 k \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 , the\nsmall parameter \u03b7 \u2261 \u03b1\u03b2/[2(\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 )], and \u03c6 is the polar angle of k. The motion of the spins, given by Eq.\n\n\f4\n(4), is averaged over the Fermi circle. Consider the term\ncos \u03a9t in Eq. (4) as an example. The angular average\nyields cos(\u03a9\u0304t) J0 (\u03b7 \u03a9\u0304t), where J0 is a Bessel function of\nthe first kind. This function has the form of a decaying oscillation but it does not reduce to an exponentially\ndamped oscillation\nin any limit. At long times we have\np\nJ0 (\u03b7 \u03a9\u0304t) \u2192 2/(\u03c0\u03b7 \u03a9\u0304t) cos(\u03b7 \u03a9\u0304t \u2212 \u03c0/4). A similar, more\ncomplicated expression in terms of Bessel functions applies for the remaining term (\u03a9\u0302 * \u015d0 )2 cos \u03a9t in Eq. (4).\nThe anisotropy of the Fermi surface introduces a mechanism for non-exponential spin decay43 with a characteristic time \u03c4d \u221d (\u03b7 \u03a9\u0304)\u22121 , referred to as the dephasing\ntime \u03c4d . For pure spin dephasing, i.e., in the absence of\nmomentum scattering, two limiting cases can be distinguished. If \u03a9(k) \u22a5 s0 for all k (e.g., a spin orientation\nperpendicular to the 2D plane on a [001] surface), spin\ndephasing reduces the spin polarization to zero. On the\nother hand, spin dephasing is completely suppressed if\n\u03a9(k) k s0 for all k (e.g., a 2D electron system in a symmetric quantum well on a [110] surface with a spin orientation perpendicular to the 2D plane6 ). In general (in\nparticular for 3D systems), an intermediate situation is\nrealized where the spin polarization is reduced because\nof dephasing, but it remains finite. The surviving part\nis identified with \u03c10k in the initial density matrix. This\nprocess is referred to as incomplete spin dephasing.\nAnalogous results hold for the k 3 -Dresselhaus model,42\nbut the terms leading to dephasing cannot be expressed\nin a simple form due to the complex angular dependence\nof |\u03a9(k)| on the direction of k. Figure 1(a) shows the incomplete dephasing of electron spins in bulk GaAs calculated using the k 3 -Dresselhaus model. At long times the\ninitial spin polarization settles to a value \u2248 0.33, which\nis independent of any system parameters, including the\nspin-orbit constant.\nD.\n\nWeak momentum scattering regime\n\nIn the regime of weak momentum scattering the solution to Eq. (3) may be written approximately as\n\u03c1\u0304(t) = \u03c1\u03040k + e\u2212t/\u03c4p e\u2212iHt\u2032 /~ \u03c10\u22a5 eiHt\u2032 /~ .\n\n(5)\n\nSince the momentum scattering rate 1/\u03c4p is small, the\nterm under the overline is taken to lowest order in 1/\u03c4p .\nThe second term on the RHS of Eq. (5) describes damped\noscillations with amplitude decaying exponentially on a\nscale \u221d \u03c4p . This trend is the inverse of that for strong\nmomentum scattering and is explained by the following\nargument. If one spin, precessing on the Fermi surface in\nphase with all the other spins, is scattered to a different\nwave vector, it will precess about a different effective field\nand will no longer be in phase with the other spins. Thus\nthe combined effect of spin precession and momentum\nscattering-even when the latter is only weak-reduces\nthe spin polarization faster. The fraction of the spin polarization corresponding to \u03c10k survives. This remaining\n\npolarization decays via spin-flip scattering (the ElliottYafet mechanism9,10 ) on much longer time scales.\nAn exception occurs when \u03a9(k) k s0 for all spins.\nThis situation is realized, e.g., for a 2D electron system\nin a symmetric quantum well on a [110] surface with a\nspin orientation perpendicular to the 2D plane. For this\nparticular case it is well known that spin precession and\nmomentum scattering do not affect at all the initial spin\norientation.6,22 From the preceding discussion we can understand this by noting that the initial density matrix\n\u03c10 = \u03c10k commutes with the spin-orbit Hamiltonian and\nEq. (3) shows that \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1\u03040k for all times. The polarization\ndecays eventually via spin-flip scattering.9,10\nIn the weak momentum scattering regime for nonnegligible anisotropy the spin decay rate is determined\nby the larger of \u03b7 \u03a9\u0304 and 1/\u03c4p . Momentum scattering introduces an exponential envelope but in this limit the\nconcept of a spin relaxation time is evidently of limited\nuse.44 In spin-1/2 systems dephasing will be important\nfor high-mobility carriers. Results consistent with our\nfindings were obtained experimentally by Brand et al.45\nwho studied the oscillatory time evolution of an opticallygenerated spin polarization in a high-mobility 2D electron system in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. Similarly,\nin materials in which a nonequilibrium spin density is excited, the time evolution of this spin density can be studied, for example, by means of magnetic circular dichroism\ntechniques.46\nWe have assumed an initial spin distribution sharp\nat the Fermi edge. In practice this distribution spans\na window in k-space, introducing additional dephasing\nbetween spins at wave vectors of slightly different magnitudes. In this case even an isotropic spin splitting leads\nto decay, though the polarization due to \u03c10k is still robust.\nFor example, in 2D for isotropic spin splitting,\nR\ndk k cos \u03a9t \u221d t\u22122 , so that the spin polarization, instead\nof oscillating indefinitely, decays as t\u22122 .\nWe have also assumed the initial spin distribution to be\nindependent of wave vector. The theory is well-equipped\nto deal with wave-vector dependent spin polarizations.\n(Indeed, the initial spin distribution, contained in the\ndensity matrix \u03c10 , is in general wave vector-dependent.)\nThe wave vector-independent cases discussed at length\nare intended as examples, and they have been selected as\nmore straightforward cases for clarity.\n\nIV.\n\nSPIN-3/2 HOLE SYSTEMS\n\nNext we discuss spin-3/2 hole systems, which are different from spin-1/2 electron systems for several reasons.\nThe presence of extra terms in the spin density matrix\nof spin-3/2 systems (in addition to the number density\nand spin polarization) has important consequences for\nspin dynamics.29,47 Spin-orbit coupling affects the energy\nspectrum in the valence band to a greater extent, and the\nspin orientation often disappears on scales comparable to\n\u03c4p . The relation \u03a9 \u03c4p \u226a 1 holds less frequently than for\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nFIG. 1: Incomplete spin dephasing of (a) electron spins in\nthe k3 -Dresselhaus model and (b) of heavy-hole spins (solid\nlines) and light-hole spins (dashed lines) in bulk GaAs in the\nballistic limit. The vertical axis shows the normalized spin\npolarization s(t) * \u015d0 /|s0 |. The initial spin polarization s0\nis assumed to point along [001]. The Fermi wave vector is\nkF = 108 m\u22121 . Note the different time scales in (a) and (b).\n\nBallistic and weak momentum scattering\nregimes in the spherical approximation\n\nIn the ballistic limit Eq. (3) is again solved by \u03c1\u0304(t) =\ne\u2212iHt\u2032 /~ \u03c10 eiHt\u2032 /~ . An initial spin polarization will oscillate indefinitely since \u03a9 is the same for all holes on\nthe Fermi surface. For weak momentum scattering Eq.\n(5) applies to holes also. The spin polarization consists\nof damped oscillations, decaying on a time scale \u221d \u03c4p ,\nplus a term corresponding to \u03c10k , which survives at long\ntimes. \u03c10k does not depend on the Luttinger parameters\nor the Fermi wave vector and will therefore be the same\nin any system described by the Luttinger Hamiltonian.\nThis remaining polarization decays via spin-flip scattering as discussed in Refs. 34,35.\nC.\n\nelectrons in systems accessible experimentally.\nWe consider spin-3/2 holes to be described by the Luttinger Hamiltonian,48,49\n\u0003\n\u0001\n~2 \u0002\nH0 =\n\u03b31 + 25 \u03b3\u0304 k 2 \u2212 2\u03b3\u0304(k * S)2 \u2212 HC ,\n2m0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m0 is the bare electron mass, S the spin operator for effective spin 3/2, \u03b3\u0304 \u2261 (2\u03b32 + 3\u03b33 )/5, and \u03b31 ,\n\u03b32 , and \u03b33 are Luttinger parameters. HC represents the\nanisotropic terms with cubic symmetry49 which will be\ngiven below.\nWe work first in the spherical approximation in which\nHC is neglected. The energy dispersions EHH for the\nheavy holes (HHs, spin projection in the direction of k\nis ms = \u00b13/2) and ELH for the light holes (LHs, ms =\n\u00b11/2) are ELH/HH (k) = ~2 k 2 (\u03b31 \u00b1 2\u03b3\u0304)/(2m0 ).\n\nA.\n\nExponential decay in the strong momentum\nscattering regime\n\nIn the strong momentum scattering limit an exponential solution \u03c1\u0304(t) = e\u2212\u0393s t \u03c1\u03040 is possible.

(8) are usually neglected in charge and spin transport without a\nsignificant loss of accuracy. However, they play a crucial\nrole in spin relaxation in the weak momentum scattering\nregime, which for holes extends over a wide range of k.\nDue to the presence of HC , the energy dispersion relations and therefore |\u03a9(k)| depend on the direction of k,\ncausing an initial spin polarization to decay even in the\nballistic limit, where incomplete spin dephasing occurs.\nOur numerical calculations exemplified in Fig. 1(b) show\nthat an initial spin polarization falls to a fraction much\nhigher than in the electron cases studied. It decays more\nslowly for the LHs, for which the Fermi surface is nearly\nspherical, than for the HHs, for which the Fermi surface\ndeviates significantly from a sphere. At long times the\ninitial spin polarization settles to a value \u2248 0.75, which\nis independent of any system parameters, including the\nLuttinger parameters.\nHC =\n\n(7)\nV.\n\nwhere now the frequency \u03a9(k) = (ELH \u2212 EHH )/~ =\n2~\u03b3\u0304k 2 /m0 corresponds to the energy difference between\nthe HH and LH bands.29 Despite the qualitatively different spin precession, the situation is rather similar to\nelectron spin relaxation and can be explained in terms of\nthe same random walk picture familiar from the study of\nelectron spin relaxation.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the decay of spin\npolarization in semiconductors, brought about by the interplay of spin precession and momentum scattering, depends strongly on the regime of momentum scattering.\nIn the ballistic regime the spin polarization decays via\na dephasing mechanism which is present due to the fact\n\n\f6\nthat the magnitude of the spin-orbit interaction generally depends on the direction of the wave vector. This\nmechanism may reduce a spin polarization to zero (complete dephasing) or a fraction of the initial value (incomplete dephasing). Weak momentum scattering destroys\nan initial spin polarization, whereas strong momentum\nscattering helps maintain an initial polarization.\nThe authors are grateful to S.

B 71, 241312 (2005)] who studied the\nspin dynamics of electrons in magnetic fields in quantum\nwells with random spin-orbit coupling.\nThe relation \u03c4s \u221d \u03c4p was also found for the specific case\nof the Rashba Hamiltonian in Ref. 37, and more generally\nin Ref. 38, although neither paper discusses oscillations in\nthe spin polarization.
