Lyth\nPhysics Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB, U.K.\n\nThe scale\u2013independence of the primordial curvature perturbation suggests that it comes from\nthe vacuum fluctuation during inflation of a light scalar field. This field may be the inflaton, or\na different 'curvaton' field. The observation of primordial non\u2013gaussianity would be a smoking\ngun for the curvaton model, while the observation of gravitational waves originating during\nslow\u2013roll inflation would rule out the model.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nParticle physics in the regime beyond the Standard Model is certainly relevant for the early\nUniverse. As a result, astronomical observations of many different kinds have the potential to\nexplore this regime.\nThe particular concern for this talk is the origin of the primordial curvature perturbation,\nwhich is now known to be the dominant cause of structure in the Universe 1 . At the outset I\nwould like to draw attention to a paradigm shift, which has taken place so slowly that it has\ngone largely unnoticed. Twenty years ago, when inflation was proposed, the received wisdom\nwas that practically all fields have gauge interactions. As a result there was supposed to be\na desert between the TeV and the GUT energy scales, containing essentially no new physics.\nIn particular, nothing significant was supposed to happen in the early Universe as the energy\ndensity falls from the GUT to the TeV scale. The paradigm shift that I have in mind is the\ngradual population, actually starting in the late seventies, of the desert by gauge singlet fields\nto do important jobs, such as\n\u2022 eliminate the CP\u2013violating \u03b8 term of QCD (axion and supersymmetric partners)\n\u2022 generate the \u03bc term of the MSSM\na\n\nInvited talk at Rencontres de Moriond (The Cosmological Model) March 2002, to appear in the proceedings\n\n\f\u2022 generate neutrino masses (seesaw mechanism)\n\u2022 provide an origin for supersymmetry breaking (string moduli)\n\u2022 provide a lepto- or baryogenesis mechanism (eg. a late\u2013decaying right\u2013handed sneutrino)\n\u2022 provide a dark matter candidate (wimpzilla)\n\u2022 implement inflation (the inflaton, which however need not be a gauge singlet)\n\u2022 provide a 'curvaton' field 2 , which is not the inflaton but is nevertheless the origin of the\nprimordial curvature perturbation (the focus of this talk).\nIt is gratifying that gauge singlets seem to be quite natural in the context of string theory. A\nfrequent feature of cosmologies involving gauge singlets is a rather low final reheat temperature,\ncorresponding to the decay of a long\u2013lived gauge singlet which is not the inflaton.\n2\n\nThe primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6\n\nThe curvature perturbation \u03b6 is defined 3,4 through the line element on spacetime slices of uniform\nenergy density \u03c1,\ndl2 = a2 (t)\u03b4ij dxi dxj (1 + 2\u03b6(x, t))\n(1)\nIt is of interest only on scales far outside the horizon, and on such scales it is practically the same\nas the curvature perturbation R defined 5,6 on the slices orthogonal to comoving worldlines (ie.\nsuch slices practically coincide with the uniform\u2013density slices). In contrast with the curvature\nperturbation on other slices (such as the Bardeen potential \u03a6 defined on slices orthogonal to\nzero\u2013shear worldlines) \u03b6 \u2243 R is time\u2013independent on super\u2013horizon scales provided that the\npressure perturbation is adiabatic 5,4 . Here, 'adiabatic' means that the pressure P is uniform\non the uniform\u2013energy\u2013density slices, or in other words that there is a unique relation \u03c1(P )\nthroughout spacetime. This holds during complete matter\u2013domination (P = 0) and during\ncomplete radiation\u2013domination (P = \u03c1/3) and also during single\u2013field inflation. It may fail\nthough when there is a mixture of matter and radiation, the extreme case being the curvaton\nmodel that I shall discuss.\nIn the present context 'primordial' denotes the epoch in the early Universe a few Hubble\ntimes before scales of cosmological interest start to enter the horizon. At this epoch the Universe\nis supposed to be completely radiation\u2013dominated so that the curvature perturbation \u03b6 is time\u2013\nindependent. Observation is presently consistent with the hypothesis that \u03b6 is (i) gaussian (eg.\n3\nthe non\u2013linear parameter fNL is <\n\u223c 10 ) and (ii) has a completely scale\u2013independent spectrum\n(spectral index n \u2243 1.0 \u00b1 0.1). How do these findings compare with theory? On the usual hypothesis that \u03b6 is generated by the inflaton the answer is well\u2013known; almost perfect gaussianity\nis predicted (in particular fNL \u223c 1) but in most models one expects significant scale\u2013dependence\nallowing even present observation to discriminate between models 7 . As we shall see the situation is almost reversed on the alternative 'curvaton' hypothesis; significant non\u2013gaussianity is\ngeneric so that even the present observation constrains the parameter space, while significant\nscale\u2013dependence, though possible, seems less likely than under the usual hypothesis.\n3\n\nNature points us towards exponential inflation with four\u2013dimensional field theory\n\nThe existence of a scale\u2013independent primordial curvature perturbation is beautifully explained\nby the following rather conservative scenario 1,2 . The observable Universe starts out inside\n\n\fthe horizon (Hubble distance) during an era of almost exponential inflation. As each cosmological scale leaves the horizon, the vacuum fluctuation of some light scalar field is converted\nto a classical scale\u2013independent perturbation. This perturbation then generates the curvature\nperturbation either directly (the inflaton hypothesis) or indirectly (the curvaton hypothesis).\nIn this scenario, one has to be able to integrate out any extra dimensions to give an effective\nfour\u2013dimensional (4D) field theory. String theory and branes may play a crucial role, but only\nindirectly in determining the form of the effective field theory.\nAn extraordinarily well-publicized alternative to inflation is the (now cyclic) ekpyrotic scenario 8 . Inflation is replaced by collapse, under the influence of an exponential potential V (\u03c6)\nwhere \u03c6 is measures the distance between a pair of colliding branes in one extra dimension. In\ncontrast with the case of inflation, the perturbation in \u03c6 generated by the vacuum fluctuation\nis strongly dependent on the slicing of spacetime (gauge) 9 and is scale\u2013independent only for a\nparticular choice corresponding to the Bardeen potential \u03a6. It is conjectured that the bounce\nwill convert \u03a6 to \u03b6, but that seems to me implausible because the bounce is described by stringy\nhigher\u2013dimensional physics that does not 'know' about 4D spacetime. Instead, I would expect the bounce (if and when the necessary physics is defined) to generate perturbations in 4D\nspacetime that have nothing to do with pre\u2013bounce conditions, and do not lead to the required\nscale\u2013independent primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6. By the same token I would expect the\nsame to be true in any other bounce scenario, including 'pre\u2013big\u2013bang' 10 which invokes stringy\nfields with no potential.\n4\n\nSlow\u2013roll inflation\n\nThe simplest way of generating almost exponential inflation is through the slow\u2013roll mechanism\n1 . This invokes Einstein gravity, and a canonically\u2013normalized inflaton field \u03c6 whose potential\nV (\u03c6) satisfies the flatness conditions \u01eb \u226a 1 and |\u03b7| \u226a 1 where\n1 2 \u2032\nM (V /V )2\n2 P\n= 3V \u2032\u2032 /H 2 .\n\n\u01eb \u2261\n\u03b7 \u2261 MP2 V \u2032\u2032 /V\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nBecause of the flatness conditions, the equations of motion\n1\n3MP2 H 2 (t) = V (\u03c6) + \u03c6\u03072\n2\n0 = \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\ngenerally have the attractor solution 3H \u03c6\u0307 \u2243 \u2212V \u2032 leading as required to |\u1e22/H 2 | \u226a 1.\nIt is usually assumed that the 4D field theory containing \u03c6 remains valid after inflation.\nIn that case the theory has to contain the Standard Model, corresponding to a lagrangian\nL(\u03c6, * * * , SM fields). As a result the flatness of the inflationary potential has to be protected\nagainst the effects of supergravity and radiative corrections. In particular, the condition |V \u2032\u2032 | \u226a\nH 2 requires either (i) a cancellation in tree\u2013level supergravity potential (implying a special form\nfor the Kahler potential and superpotential) or (ii) unsuppressed inflaton couplings which flatten\nthe renormalization group improved potential leading to a 'running mass' inflation model. 7 .\nA radical alternative has recently been proposed 11 (see 12 for references to later work) in\nwhich the transition from inflation to the conventional big bang (reheating) involves stringy\nhigher\u2013dimensional physics that cannot be described by 4D field theory. The inflaton \u03c6 is a\nstringy field (for instance the distance between a pair of colliding branes) and the lagrangian\nduring inflation contains only \u03c6 and maybe a few other stringy fields, L(\u03c6, * * *). The inflaton\npotential, determined directly by string theory, is supposed to be flat enough for inflation.\n\n\f(In the original proposal 11 it was the same up to a constant as the exponential inter\u2013brane\npotential invoked later for the ekpyrotic scenario.) It seems to me that this 'brane inflation'\nshares the problem of ekpyrotic and other bouncing scenarios; the era immediately preceding the\nconventional big bang (in this case the reheating era) does not 'know' about 4D spacetime, and\nwill presumably generate unviable 4D perturbations which have nothing to do with the earlier\nera when scales are leaving the horizon (in this case the era of inflation).\n5\n\nThe inflaton scenario for generating the curvature perturbation\n\nDuring almost\u2013exponential inflation every light field acquires an almost scale\u2013independent perturbation. Which of these fields is responsible for the primordial curvature perturbation? The\nalmost universally accepted answer is; the inflaton! Indeed, the inflaton automatically generates\na curvature perturbation. A few Hubble times after cosmological scales leave the horizon the\nspectrum and spectral index are given by 1\n4\nP\u03b6 (k) =\n25\nn(k) \u2212 1 \u2261\n\n1\nV3\n75\u03c0 2 MP6 V \u20322\nd ln P\u03b6\n= 2\u03b7 \u2212 6\u01eb ,\nd ln k\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere on each scale the potential and its derivatives are evaluated at the epoch of horizon exit\nk = aH. This epoch is given in terms of the field value at the end of slow\u2013roll inflation by\nln(kend /k) \u2261 N (k) = MP\u22122\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\n\n(V /V \u2032 )d\u03c6 .\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c6end\n\nOn cosmological scales N <\n\u223c 60, the value depending on the history of the Universe after inflation.\nIn 'single\u2013field' models of inflation, which are the most typical, the inflationary trajectory in field space is essentially unique, and it determines the epoch at which inflation gives\nway to matter\u2013 or radiation\u2013domination. The curvature perturbation in such models is time\u2013\nindependent until the end of inflation. In 'two\u2013field' models the flatness conditions are satisfied\nin two different field directions, and there is a family of possible inflationary trajectories (lines of\nsteepest descent) which are curved in field space. In those models the spectrum of the curvature\nperturbation increases somewhat during inflation 7 . In both cases though, the value of \u03b6 at the\nend of inflation is maintained until cosmological scales start to enter the horizon, unless there is\na curvaton field with the properties that I shall describe. According to the inflaton hypothesis\nthere is no curvaton field. The prediction of the inflaton hypothesis may be written\n1\n2\n\nXV\n\n1\n2\n\nP\u03b6 (inflaton) = P\u03b6 (observed)\n\n1\n\n1\n4\n\n\u01eb 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV\n\n!2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere X = 1 in a single\u2013field model and X > 1 in a two\u2013field (or multi\u2013field) model. In order\nfor this prediction to agree with observation, the bracket should be equal to 1. Together with\nEq. (7) this places a strong constraint on the inflationary potential, ruling out or disfavoring\nseveral attractive models. Such models usually regain their attraction if they are liberated from\nthe constraint by the curvaton hypothesis 13 .\n6\n\nThe curvaton scenario\n\n\f6.1\n\nThe sequence of events\n\nRecently, attention 2 has been drawn to the alternative possibility, that the primordial curvature\nperturbation \u03b6 is generated by a 'curvaton' field different from the inflaton. The curvaton\ngenerates the primordial curvature perturbation through the following sequence of events.b\n1. The curvature perturbation \u03b6 at the end of inflation is much less than the observed value.\n(The case where it is comparable to that value without being the same, corresponding to a\nmixture of the inflaton and curvaton mechanisms, has not been considered so far and seems\ncontrived.) Requiring that it be less than say 1% of the observed value, we learn from Eq. (9)\n1\nthat V 4 < 2 \u00d7 1015 GeV. With such a low inflation scale, gravitational waves from inflation\ncannot have a detectable effect on the cmb anisotropy 16 ! This is an anti\u2013smoking gun: assuming\nslow\u2013roll inflation, a detection of gravitational waves in the cmb anisotropy would invalidate the\npure curvaton model.\n2. The curvaton field \u03c3 acquires a gaussian perturbation \u03b4\u03c3 \u226a \u03c3 with a nearly flat spectrum\n1\n\ngiven by P\u03c32 \u2243 H/2\u03c0. The flat spectrum certainly requires a flatness condition |\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3 | \u226a 1 where\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3 \u2261 MP2 \u2202 2 V /\u2202\u03c3 2 /V .\n\n(10)\n\n3. The curvaton and its fractional perturbation survive (the latter possibly attenuated 17\nby some factor f ) until H falls below the curvaton mass m\u03c3 , which occurs during a radiation\u2013\ndominated era. The curvaton then starts to oscillate at each point in space with amplitude\n\u03c3 + \u03b4\u03c3(x), corresponding to curvaton energy density\n1\n1\n\u03b4\u03c3(x)\n\u03c1\u03c3 (x) = m2\u03c3 (\u03c3 + \u03b4\u03c3(x))2 \u2243 m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2 1 + 2\n2\n2\n\u03c3\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nAt this stage there is still no curvature perturbation but there is an approximately gaussian\nisocurvature density perturbation, specified by the gauge\u2013independent entropy perturbation\nS\u03c3,rad \u2261\n\u2243\n\n1 \u03b4\u03c1rad\n1 \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n\u2212\n3 \u03c1\u03c3\n4 \u03c1rad\n1 \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n2 \u03b4\u03c3\n\u2243\n.\n3 \u03c1\u03c3\n3 \u03c3\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere 'rad' denotes the radiation. In the second line, \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3 and \u03b4\u03c3 are evaluated on flat slices.\n4. The curvaton has no gauge coupling, and any Yukawa couplings are suppressed. As a\nresult it survives for some time, during which r \u2261 \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1rad grows like the scale factor a. During\nthis time S\u03c3,rad remains constant but a curvature perturbation develops given by\n\u03b6(t) =\n\n3r(t)\nS\u03c3,rad\n4 + 3r(t)\n\n(14)\n\n5. The curvaton decays into radiation, after which \u03b6 is constant. The prediction for the\nspectrum of the primordial density perturbation is therefore\n1\n\nP\u03b62 \u2243\n\nf\nr\n\u03c0 4 + 3r\n\ndecay\n\nH\n\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\ninflation\n\nFor a successful prediction the right hand side must be equal to 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nIn the curvaton model, the spectral index defining the scale\u2013dependence is given in terms of\nthe derivatives of the potential at horizon exit by 2,18\nn \u2212 1 = 2\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 2\u01eb ,\n\n(16)\n\nThis may be compared with the usual inflaton scenario which gives n \u2212 1 = 2\u03b7 \u2212 6\u01eb.\nb\n\nThe basic mechanism was discovered by Mollerach 14 , and the possible non\u2013gaussianity of \u03b6 was noted by\nLinde and Mukhanov 15 .\n\n\f6.2\n\nA new way of handling curvature and isocurvature perturbations\n\nLet me pause to give a simple derivation of the prediction Eq. (14), based on a new way 2,4 of\nhandling the perturbations. The starting point as usual is the assumption that we have N fluids\neach with a definite equation of state Pi (\u03c1i ). The total energy density is\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\n\u03c1i\n\n(17)\n\ni\n\nand each fluid separately satisfies the continuity equation\n\u03c1\u0307i = \u22123H(\u03c1i + Pi )\n\n(18)\n\nThe new idea is to work with the N curvature perturbations \u03b6i , defined on slices of uniform\n\u03c1i . They are given in terms of the separate density perturbations (defined on flat slices) by the\nstandard expression\n1 \u03b4\u03c1i\n\u03b4\u03c1i\n=\u2212\n(19)\n\u03b6i = H\u2206ti = H\n\u03c1\u0307i\n3 \u03c1i + Pi\nwhere \u2206ti is the displacement between flat\u2013 and uniform\u2013density slices. The separate curvature\nperturbations are time\u2013independent on super\u2013horizon scales 4 , and so are the entropy perturbations\nSij \u2261 \u03b6i \u2212 \u03b6j\n(20)\nbut the total curvature perturbation is time\u2013dependent,\n\u03b6(t) =\n\nP\n\ni \u03c1\u0307i (t)\u03b6i\n\n(21)\n\n\u03c1(t)\n\nIn our case N = 2, the fluids being the curvaton with P = 0 and the radiation with P = 13 \u03c1,\nwhich leads immediately to Eq. (14).\n6.3\n\nNon\u2013gaussianity\n\nIn the final equality of Eq. (13) the quadratic term term has been neglected. Including it gives\n\u0010\n\n2\n2\n\u2212 \u03b6gauss\n\u03b6 \u2243 \u03b6gauss + fNL \u03b6gauss\n\n\u0011\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03b6gauss \u223c 10\u22125 is the gaussian contribution whose spectrum is given by Eq. (15) and\nfNL \u223c\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c3\n\n\u223c 105 f\ndecay\n\nH\n\u03c3\n\n(23)\ninflation\n\n3\nAt present the observational bound is fNL <\n\u223c 10 which already constrains the parameters of\nthe curvaton model. In contrast, the inflaton hypothesis gives fNL \u223c 1 which is practically\nunobservable. A future detection fNL \u226b 1 would be a smoking gun for the curvaton hypothesis.\nAnother possible signature of the curvaton model, which I shall not discuss here, is an isocurvature perturbation in the baryon or neutrino density that is directly related to the curvature\nperturbation because it is generated by the curvaton decay 18 . Such an isocurvature perturbation\nwould automatically be of potentially observable magnitude and would be 100% correlated with\nthe curvature perturbation. This is in contrast with the usual mechanism for producing an\nisocurvature perturbation (CDM, baryon or neutrino), namely to invoke a field different from\nthe one producing the curvature perturbation. With such a mechanism there is no reason why\nthe isocurvature perturbation should be of observable magnitude, and also it is typically uncorrelated with the curvature perturbation. Partial correlation occurs in two\u2013field models 19 , but\nonly in the very special case that the field causing the isocurvature perturbation is a combination\nof the two fields (the one orthogonal to the inflaton at the end of inflation.)\n\n\f6.4\n\nWho is the curvaton?\n\nAs with the inflaton, the flatness condition |\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3 | \u226a 1 during inflation is difficult to achieve in the\ncontext of supergravity. More seriously, the flatness condition will probably have to be preserved\nafter inflation until H falls below the true mass m\u03c3 , to avoid wiping out 17 the perturbation\nin \u03c3. The latter requirement especially suggests that the curvaton may be a pseudo\u2013goldstone\nboson, whose potential is under all circumstances kept flat by a global symmetry. In that case\none might expect \u03b7\u03c3\u03c3 to be tiny, typically implying a spectral index very close to 1.\nNevertheless, the attractive alternative that the curvaton may correspond to a flat direction\nof global supersymmetry is worth investigating 17 . Candidates in the latter case might be a\nright\u2013handed sneutrino 20 or a string modulus 21 .\n6.5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only known mechanism for generating the observed scale\u2013independent primordial curvature\nperturbation is the traditional one, involving exponential inflation in the context of a four\u2013\ndimensional field theory which is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. In\nthis scenario, extra dimensions and branes may play an important role in determining the form\nof the field theory, but they are not directly relevant. The scenario does not require that the\ninflaton is responsible for the curvature perturbation. Some other 'curvaton' field might do the\njob, and its presence might be signalled by primordial non\u2013gaussianity.\nReferences\n1. D. H. Lyth & A. R.
