A spontaneous (zero field) split of the ZBCP was observed only in\noverdoped samples (either by O or by Ca). The magnitude of this split was found to be\nlinear in doping.

The field susceptibility \u03c7=\ndiverges at the point at which spontaneous\ndH H \u21920\n\nZBCP splitting occurs, its inverse value, \u03c7-1, following a linear doping dependence on\nboth the underdoped and overdoped sides. We discuss these results in terms of recent\ntheoretical models of Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking (TRSB).\n\n\f2\n\nIt is by now well established that the Order Parameter (OP) in the High Tc Cuprates has\na dominant d-wave component.[1] A consequence of such a symmetry is that low energy\nsurface bound states are created at all surfaces whose normal is not aligned with the\n(1,0,0) or equivalent direction.[2] These states are due to interference effects between\nquasiparticles that undergo Andreev reflections from lobes of the OP having opposite\nsigns. If the OP has the pure dx2-y2 symmetry, zero energy states are created. When\nprobed through a tunnel junction with a normal electrode, these states give a ZBCP.[3]\nIn the presence of surface currents the degeneracy between states carrying currents of\nopposite signs is lifted, and the ZBCP is split by energy 2\u03b4, proportional to the\namplitude of the surface currents.[4] Field induced splitting was studied in detail in\nrecent publications.[5], [6], [7], [8] A spontaneous split of the ZBCP interpreted as\nresulting from spontaneous surface currents, or equivalently to spontaneous TRSB was\nalso reported in Refs.[6], [7], [8] .Such currents imply the existence of an is or a idxy,\ncomponent, whose amplitude is equal, at low temperatures, to the value of the zero field\nsplitting \u03b4(0).[9] However, in other tunneling experiments on YBa2Cu3O7-x spontaneous\nZBCP splitting was not observed.[10], [11], [12], [13], yet it appears to be systematic in\nCa overdoped Y1-yCayBa2Cu3O7-x [14], [15].\nIn this contribution we resolve this apparent experimental irreproducibility. We\nshow that the spontaneous splitting of the ZBCP is doping dependent, being always\npresent beyond a certain doping level (near the optimum, which is the doping level\ngiving the maximum Tc), and never at lower ones. The amplitude of \u03b4(0) varies as the\ndistance from optimum doping, (p-pc) where p is the hole concentration and pc its value\nat the optimum level. In addition, we find that at that the field splitting is in fact also\nstrongly doping dependent, the inverse susceptibility \u03c7-1 varies as p \u2212 pc . The doping\n\ndependences of \u03b4(0) and of \u03c7 are in good agreement with recent theoretical models for a\nQuantum Critical Point (QCP), where the symmetry changes from pure dx2-y2 to dx2y2+idxy.\n\n\f3\n\n(1,1,0) oriented YBa2Cu3O7-x films of various doping levels near the optimal\ndoping were grown on (1,1,0) SrTiO3 substrates, using RF and DC off-axis sputtering.\nA PrBa2Cu3O7-x template was used in order to reduce the (1,0,3) orientations, following\nthe method used by Poelders et al.[16]. Garcia Lopez et al.[17] showed that changing the\noxygen pressure and the amount of atomic and ionic oxygen in the plasma could control\nthe amount of oxygen loaded in the YBa2Cu3O7-x films during the growth. In addition,\nthey showed that the film remains oxidized if quenched at room temperature. We have\nused this method of Garcia Lopez et al. to grow the slightly oxygen overdoped samples,\nwith the doping level controlled by the amount of water vapor added to the plasma. This\naffects the amount of atomic oxygen in the plasma.[18] By increasing it, we obtained a\nreduction of Tc and of\n\n, the position of the d-wave gap feature. Underdoping was\n\nachieved by annealing in a low oxygen pressure. Additionally we have prepared\noverdoped\n\nY0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-x\n\nand\n\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-x\n\nfilms\n\nas\n\ndescribed\n\nelsewhere.[15], [19].\nTo make sure that we have indeed obtained overdoped films we have annealed\nthem in a low oxygen pressure environment at 650\u00b0C, a Tc of 90K was then retrieved as\nexpected. In addition we have found the R(T) characteristics to be different in\noverdoped and underdoped samples. In fig.1 the R(T) characteristics of one overdoped\nand one underdoped YBa2Cu3O7-x films are presented. The contacts were put in a square\nwith its sides parallel to the [0,0,1] and to the [1, 1 ,0] directions. The film resistances\nare measured with the current running parallel to the ab planes, the in plane resistance\npresented in the figure is calculated using the procedure of ref.[20]. One can note that\nR(T) of the overdoped sample has the expected positive curvature [21] while the\nunderdoped film exhibits the downwards deviation from linearity, signaling the\npseudogap temperature, [22] at T > Tc.\n\n\f4\n\nWe have made a systematic study of the spontaneous and field induced ZBCP\nsplitting in 14 YBa2Cu3O7-x samples, with thickness ranging from 2400\u00c5 to 800\u00c5, as a\nfunction of the level of oxygen doping. The most underdoped films had Tc=83.6K and\nthe most overdoped films had Tc=85.6K, down-set the transition width was about 1K in\nthe overdoped samples and 2K in the underdoped ones. We have also studied 2\nY0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-x and 2 Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-x samples. The Ca doped films had a wide\nresistive transition (with a width of 5K). The counter electrode used for junction\nfabrication was Indium. Junction preparation and characterization are described\nelsewhere.[15], [11], [23]. All measurements were taken at T=4.2K. Field splitting of the\nZBCP was observed in all samples when the magnetic field was applied parallel to the\nsurface of the film, along the c direction. Upon applying the field parallel to the surface\nof the film, but along the [1, 1 ,0] direction only a weak splitting, one or two orders of\nmagnitude smaller was observed, as already reported.[7], [8] The d-wave gap feature,\nhowever, is sensitive to a field applied in both directions, and may be even somewhat\nmore sensitive to a field applied parallel to the CuO planes.\nTwo typical data sets obtained on YBa2Cu3O7-x films are shown Fig.2\n(underdoped, Tc=85.9K) and Fig.3 (overdoped, Tc=85.9K down-set). Insets show how\nthe ZBCP splits as a function of magnetic field. In both cases, the low field behavior of\n\u03b4(H) is linear, the slope determining the susceptibility, \u03c7. A spontaneous splitting of the\nZBCP is seen only the in overdoped sample (\u03b4(0)=2.4mV). Notice that the conductance\npeak at about 16mV, due to the d-wave gap, is well defined in both samples.\nIn fig.4 we present the conductance characteristics at various magnetic fields for\nan (overdoped) Y0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-x sample. We note that the d-wave gap feature is here\nwider than in the YBa2Cu3O7-x samples, presumably due to the disorder introduced by\nCa doping.[24] A zero field splitting \u03b4(0)=2.4mV is seen. In the inset we show the field\n\n\f5\n\nsplitting versus magnetic field. The characteristics of Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-x samples are\nqualitatively similar to those already shown in refs. [15], [19].\nThe data shown Fig.2 to 4 is typical, in the sense that spontaneous splitting at\n4.2K is never observed in underdoped samples, but always in overdoped ones (either by\nO or by Ca). This confirms the findings of refs. [14], [15]. Field splitting exists in both\nunderdoped and overdoped samples, but is doping dependent. In fact, as shown earlier,\nat optimum doping \u03b4(H) is not linear, but rather varies as\n\nH .[11]\n\nFig.5 summarizes our results (YBa2Cu3O7-x samples) for the doping dependence\nof \u03b4(0) and \u03c7-1. \u03b4(0) and \u03c7-1 are plotted against (\u2206max-\u2206)1/2, where \u2206max is the value of the\nd-wave gap at optimum doping, and \u2206, its value for the sample under consideration, as\n\nmeasured on each junction [23]. As shown in the insert of fig.5, \u2206/kTc is constant within\nour experimental accuracy, in the range of doping investigated here. Since it is known\nthat Tc has a parabolic doping dependence near optimum doping, (\u2206max-\u2206)1/2 is\nproportional to \uf8e6p-pc\uf8e6where p is the hole doping level and pc its value at optimum\ndoping.[25]. As seen in Fig.5, \u03b4(0) \u221d(p-pc) and \u03c7-1\u221d\uf8e6p-pc\uf8e6. We have found these results\nto be thickness independent. [26]\nWe shall now discuss theoretical models dealing with TRSB in the High Tc\ncuprates.\nFogelstr\u00f6m et al.[9] have attributed the zero field ZBCP splitting to surface\ncurrents induced by spontaneous is surface component, and the field splitting to\nMeissner currents. However, having found the field splitting to be independent of film\nthickness, we must conclude that it cannot be principally due to Meissner currents.[26]\nTanuma et al.[27] have calculated the doping dependence of the amplitude of a possible\nspontaneous surface is component. Their results do show a weakening in the\nunderdoped regime, but very little dependence around optimum doping.\n\n\f6\n\nAnother possible origin of spontaneous surface currents is a modification of the\nbulk OP, in the form of an idxy component. Laughlin has shown that such a component\nis energetically favorable in the presence of a field B, applied perpendicular to the CuO\nplanes. [28] This is because it involves a magnetic moment (while an is component does\nnot). Deutscher et al.[15] have proposed that both the spontaneous and the field induced\nsplitting are due to a bulk idxy component, whose value is the OP of an dx2-y2 to dx2y2+idxy\n\nphase transition. This OP minimizes the free energy, which is proposed to have\n\nthe form:\n3\n\nF = a\u03b42 + b \u03b4 + cB\u03b4\n\n(1)\n\nWhere a\u221d(pc-p) and b, c (c<0) are given by Laughlin.[28] Minimization of the free\nenergy with respect to \u03b4 gives at p>pc the equilibrium value:\n\u03b4=\n\n\u2212 a + a 2 \u2212 3bcB\n3b\n\n(2)\n\nThis model predicts that \u03c7 diverges at the critical point p=pc as it is approached from\nboth sides. It has already been shown that \u03c7 is very large at optimum doping, while the\nfield splitting being in fact nonlinear in field, varying rather as\n\nH .[11] This is in\n\nagreement with Eq.2, assuming that the critical point is at, or very near, optimum\n\u03b3\n\ndoping. The results, that we report here, show that indeed \u03c7 \u22121 \u221d p \u2212 p c with \u03b3=1\u00b10.05\nfor the underdoped range and \u03b3=1\u00b10.3 for the overdoped range, \u03b4(0) \u221d (p \u2212 pc ) with\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2=1\u00b10.3, in agreement with the model with \u03b3 and \u03b2 being the critical indices for the\n\nsusceptibility and of the OP. The obvious advantage of the model is that it allows a\ncomplete description of the data, based on a single free energy expression. Simmilar\nresults can be obtained with the critical point being slightly on the overdoped side. If\none assumes \u03b3=\u03b2=1, the best fit to the data is obtained for a critical point at [\u2206max\u2206]1/2=0.16 (mV)1/2, on the overdoped side. Indications for a critical point on the\n\noverdoped side have been given by Bernhard et al..[29]\n\n\f7\n\nRecently, Vojta et al.[30] have also conjectured, on the basis of angle resolved\nscattering rate measurements by Vala et al.[31], that there exists in the vicinity of the\nsuperconducting phase of the cuprates, a QCP where a dx2-y2 to a dx2-y2+idxy transition\ntakes place.\nKhveshchenko and Paaske [32] have calculated the free energy near a dx2-y2 to a\ndx2-y2+idxy QCP, taking into account the interactions between the quasiparticles near the\n\nnodes and fluctuations of the OP. They obtained \u03b2=0.87 and \u03b3\u22481, also in agreement with\nour data.\nAssuming a doping driven phase transition allows a complete description of the\ndata, particularly of the fact that the susceptibility diverges at the doping level beyond\nwhich spontaneous ZBCP splitting exist. We are therefore inclined to believe that it is\nthe most likely explanation of the spontaneous and field induced symmetry breaking\neffects that we have reported here.\n\nOne of us (G.D.) is indebted to Carlo di Castro Claudio Castellani and Marco Grilli for\nan in-depth discussion of our data, and for pointing out that the critical indices\ncalculated by Khveshchenko and Paaske imply \u03b3 of the order of 1 also in agreement with\nour experiments. We are indebted to Y. Tanaka and A. Kohen for useful discussions.\nThis work was supported in part by the Heinrich Hertz - Minerva Center for High\nTemperature Superconductivity, by the Israeli Science Foundation and by the Oren\nFamily Chair of Experimental Solid State Physics.\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Y.
