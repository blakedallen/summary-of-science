Many QKD protocols [1] encode\nkey information in discrete variables of single photon light pulses, such as polarization or\nphase [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Recently, other protocols using so-called continuous variables\n(CV), such as both quadratures of a coherent state, have been proposed [10, 11, 12, 13,\n14, 15]. Channel symbols are formed by conjugate continuous quantum variables, linked by\nHeisenberg inequalities. The secrecy of the QKD protocol is based on the resulting quantum\nuncertainty relations. Such protocols eliminate the need for single photon technology, as they\nonly require standard off-the-shelf telecom components - such as diode lasers, electro-optics\nmodulators, and PIN photodiodes - compatible with high repetition rates. On the other\nhand, CVQKD protocols require elaborate classical error correction algorithms to efficiently\nextract secret bits from correlated continuous variables.\nIn this paper, we describe a complete implementation of the coherent-state reversereconciliated (RR) CVQKD protocol described in [14]. In this protocol, the quadratures\nx and p of a train of coherent-state pulses are modulated in the complex plane with a centered bi-variate Gaussian modulation of variance VA N0 , where N0 is the shot noise variance\nthat appears in the Heisenberg relation \u2206x\u2206p \u2265 N0 . These coherent states are sent from\nAlice to Bob through the quantum channel, along with a strong phase reference - or local\noscillator (LO). Upon reception, Bob randomly measures the x or p quadrature by making\nthe signal interfere with the LO in a pulsed, shot-noise limited homodyne detector. This\nprotocol allows Alice and Bob to share a set of correlated Gaussian data. A random fraction\nof this set is publicly revealed to probe the transmission parameters, while the remaining\npart is used to build a secret key based on Bob's data. This is achieved in practice with\na classical error correction scheme called \"Multi-Level Coding\" using efficient one-way Low\nDensity Parity Check (LDPC) codes. We report the full implementation of both quantum\nand classical parts of this RRCVQKD protocol over a standard single-mode telecom fiber of\n25 km, leading to a final secret key distribution rate of more than 2 kb/s.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHEORETICAL EVALUATION OF THE SECRET KEY RATES\n\nIn this Section, we detail the calculation of the secret key rates that are available to Alice\nand Bob when applying the RRCVQKD protocol. In QKD, one evaluates the secret key\nrate by upper bounding the information that the adversary, Eve, can acquire in the worst\ncase. This is typically done under the following assumptions: (i) Eve has no limit in terms\nof computational power; (ii) Eve has full control over the quantum channel, and is only\nlimited in her action on this channel by the laws of quantum physics; (iii) Eve can freely\nmonitor the classical public channel used for key distillation, but she cannot modify the\nmessages (authenticated channel); (iv) Eve has no access to the laboratories (apparatuses)\nof Alice and Bob. Traditionally, the type of attacks that Eve can implement are ranked by\nincreasing power into three classes, depending on how exactly she interacts with the pulses\nsent by Alice with auxiliary pulses (ancillae), and on when she measures these ancillae. The\ntheoretical bound on Eve's information depends on the class of attacks that is considered:\n\u2022 Individual attack: Eve interacts individually with each pulse sent by Alice, and stores\nher ancilla in a quantum memory. She then performs an appropriate measurement\non her ancilla after the sifting procedure (during which Bob reveals whether he chose\nto measure x or p), but before the key distillation stage (in particular, before error\ncorrection). Using this attack, the maximum information accessible to Eve is bounded\nby the classical (Shannon [16, 17]) mutual information IBE on Bob's data. Moreover,\nin the case of continuous-variable QKD, it is known that the optimal individual attack\nis a Gaussian operation [18], which considerably restricts the set of attacks that need\nto be considered and yields a simple closed formula for IBE .\n\u2022 Collective attack: Eve interacts individually with each pulse sent by Alice but, instead\nof measuring immediately after sifting, she listens to the communication between Alice and Bob during the key distillation procedure, and only then applies the optimal\ncollective measurement on the ensemble of stored ancillae. In this attack, the maximum information she may have access to is limited by the Holevo bound \u03c7BE [19]. As\nin the case of individual attacks against continuous-variable QKD, Gaussian attacks\nhave been shown to be optimal among all collective attacks [20, 21], which results in\na simple expression for \u03c7BE .\n3\n\n\f\u2022 Coherent attack: This is the most powerful attack that Eve can implement. Here,\nshe is allowed to interact collectively with all the pulses sent by Alice, and, after\nhaving monitored the key distillation messages, she applies an optimal joint measurement over all the ancillae. The security with respect to this kind of attacks is more\ncomplicated to address, but, under the assumption of the symmetry of the privacy\namplification and channel probing protocols, it was proven for discrete-variable QKD\nin [22] (and conjectured for continuous-variable QKD in [20, 21]) that coherent attacks\nare not more efficient than collective attacks. This step is quite important as it ensures\nunconditional security as long as one has a security proof with respect to collective\nattacks, for which the key rates are far simpler to evaluate.\nIn the following, we will consider individual and collective attacks, for which the security\nanalysis lies on firm grounds. We will then derive expressions for IBE and \u03c7BE as a function\nof the losses and of the noise of the quantum channel, assuming as usual that Eve can take\nboth of them to her advantage. We will restrict our study to Gaussian attacks, which have\nbeen shown to be optimal [20, 21]; this significantly simplifies the calculation of the secret\nkey rates since we only have to consider covariance matrices. It is known that Alice and Bob\ncan distill perfectly correlated secret key bits provided that the amount of information they\nshare, IAB , remains higher than the information acquired by Eve (IBE or \u03c7BE for reverse\nreconciliation). In this strictly information-theoretic point of view, and in the case of RR, we\ndefine the \"raw\" key rate as \u2206I Shannon = IAB \u2212 IBE , or respectively \u2206I Holevo = IAB \u2212 \u03c7BE .\nA.\n\nEntanglement-based CVQKD scheme\n\nAn usual prepare-and-measure (P&M) implementation of a Gaussian protocol with coherent states has been described in Section I, and consists in a quantum transmission followed\nby a classical data processing. During the quantum part, Alice randomly generates two numbers (xA , pA ) from a Gaussian distribution, prepares a coherent state centered on (xA , pA ),\nand sends it to Bob through the quantum channel. Bob receives this state, and randomly\nmeasures the quadrature x or p by choosing the appropriate phase for his homodyne measurement.\nAs defined in Fig. 1, the quantum channel is characterized by its transmission T \u2264 1\nand its excess noise \u03b5 such that the noise variance at Bob's input is (1 + T \u03b5)N0 . We call\n4\n\n\fChannel input\n\nBob's input\n\nvac\nF0\nTA\nA\n\n\u03b1\n\nEPR\n\nB0\n\nQuantum\nchannel\n(T, \u03c7line)\n\nxA\n(-\u03b1)\n\nB\n\n\u03b7\n\nEPR\nB1\n\nxB\n\nE\nF\n\nAlice\n\nG\n\nBob\n\nQM\n\nEve\npA\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Entanglement-based scheme of CVQKD. The transmittance TA and \u03b7\ncharacterize the measurements at Alice's and Bob's sides, while the channel transmittance T and\nadded noise \u03c7line are controlled by Eve. The QM box corresponds to Eve's quantum memory.\n\n\u03c7line = 1/T \u2212 1 + \u03b5 the total channel added noise referred to the channel input, which is\ncomposed of the noise due to losses 1/T \u2212 1 and the excess noise \u03b5. With these notations,\nall noises are expressed in shot noise units. The signal then reaches Bob's detector, which\nis modeled by assuming that the signal is further attenuated by a factor \u03b7 (detection losses)\nand mixed with some thermal noise (electronic noise vel added by the detection electronics,\nexpressed in shot noise units). The total noise introduced by the realistic homodyne detector\nis \u03c7hom = (1 + vel )/\u03b7 \u2212 1, when referred to Bob's input. The total noise added between Alice\nand Bob then reads \u03c7tot = \u03c7line + \u03c7hom /T , referred to the channel input.\n\nIn the following, we will exploit the fact that this P&M description of QKD with Gaussian states is equivalent to the entanglement-based (EB) scheme presented in Fig. 1, which\nsimplifies the theoretical calculation of the key rates and provides a unified description of the\ndifferent existing protocols [23]. The main idea is to view Alice's quantum state preparation\nas resulting from the measurement of one half of a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (EPR\nstate). The second half of the EPR state corresponds to the state sent to Bob through\nthe quantum channel. The Gaussian state AB0 is completely determined by its covariance\nmatrix \u03b3AB0 , which has the form\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\n\u03b3VEPR = \uf8f0 \u221a\n\nV * 11\nV 2 \u2212 1 * \u03c3z\n5\n\n\u221a\n\n\uf8f9\n\nV 2 \u2212 1 * \u03c3z \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\nV * 11\n\n(1)\n\n\f\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef1 0\uf8fa\nwhere 11 = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n0 1\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef1 0 \uf8fa\nand \u03c3z = \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n0 \u22121\n\nwhere V is the variance, in shot noise units, of the thermal state that we observe if we trace\nout A. This thermal state also corresponds exactly to the thermal state observed at the\noutput of Alice's station if we implement a P&M protocol, resulting from the ensemble of\nGaussian-modulated coherent states (with some specific Gaussian distribution) [12, 13, 14,\n24]. In fact, every P&M scheme can be rigorously translated into an EB scheme. First,\nthe generated states in a P&M scheme are equivalent to the states on which mode B0 is\nprojected after Alice's measurement in an EB scheme. Second, the modulation of the states\nin a P&M scheme corresponds in the EB scheme to the variation of the mean value of the\nstate of mode B0 conditioned on Alice's measurement. This implies that the modulation\nin the P&M scheme is directly related to Alice's measurement in the EB scheme via a\none-to-one correspondence.\nAs an example, Alice applying a homodyne detection of xA (TA = 1) corresponds to\nprojecting the mode B0 onto squeezed states that are displaced according to a Gaussian\ndistribution of the measured quadrature xA . This is exactly equivalent to the protocol\nproposed in [12]. If she applies instead a heterodyne measurement (TA = 1/2), she prepares\ncoherent states modulated over a bi-dimensional Gaussian distribution of variance VA N0 , as\nin [13, 14]. Let us focus on the equivalence between the EB scheme and the P&M scheme\nin this case. In the P&M scheme, Alice randomly chooses the values xA and pA distributed\naccording to a Gaussian distribution centered on zero and of variance VA N0 , and sends Bob a\ncoherent state (VB0 |A = 1 in shot noise units) centered on (xA , pA ). In the EB scheme, Alice\nestimates the quadratures xB0 and pB0 of the state sent to Bob by multiplying the outcomes\nof her measurements by a factor \u03b1 =\n\nq\n\n2 VV \u22121\n(with a minus sign for p-quadrature) [23].\n+1\n\nHer uncertainty on the inferred values of xB0 and pB0 for a given xA and pA is exactly\nVB0 |A = 1, which corresponds to the uncertainty of a coherent state in the P&M scheme.\nThe inferred values of xB0 and pB0 are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution of\nvariance VA N0 = (V \u2212 1)N0 , which coincides with Alice's modulation in the P&M scheme.\nNote that the EB scheme allows us, at the same time, to simplify the description of\nthe realistic detector at Bob side. As shown in Fig. 1, the inefficiency of Bob's detector\nis modeled by a beam splitter with transmission \u03b7, while the electronic noise vel of Bob's\ndetector is modeled by a thermal state \u03c1F0 with variance VN N0 entering the other input port\n6\n\n\fof the beam splitter, so that VN = 1 + vel /(1 \u2212 \u03b7). Considering the thermal state \u03c1F0 as the\nreduced state obtained from a two-mode squeezed state \u03c1F0 G of variance VN N0 allows us to\nsimplify the calculations.\n\nB.\n\nIndividual attack - Shannon rate\n\nThe mutual information IAB is calculated directly from the variance VB N0 of the\nquadratures measured by Bob, with VB = \u03b7T (V + \u03c7tot ), and the conditional variance\nVB|A = \u03b7T (1 + \u03c7tot ) using Shannon's equation\nIAB =\n\n1\n1\nVB\nV + \u03c7tot\n= log2\n.\nlog2\n2\nVB|A\n2\n1 + \u03c7tot\n\n(2)\n\nIn an individual attack, Eve performs her measurements just after Bob reveals the quadrature\nhe has measured (sifting) but before the error correction. Her information is thus restricted\nto the Shannon information accessible in her ancilla after measurement, and is bounded\nusing the entropic uncertainty relations as proven in [18]. In the RR protocol, the reference\nduring the error correction protocol being Bob, Eve's information reads\nVB\n1\nlog2\n2\nVB|E\n\nIBE =\nwhere VB = \u03b7T (V + \u03c7tot )\n\nand\n\nVB|E\n\n(3)\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n+ \u03c7hom .\n=\u03b7\nT (1/V + \u03c7line )\n\nNote that we have considered the so-called \"realistic model\" suggested in [14], where Eve\ncannot benefit from the noise added by Bob's apparatus, \u03c7hom .

Alice uses a laser diode, pulsed\nwith a repetition rate of 500 kHz, to generate pulses with a width of 100 ns. Using a\nhighly asymmetric fiber-optic coupler, these pulses are split into a strong phase reference,\nthe local oscillator (LO), containing typically 109 photons per pulse, and a weak signal.\nThe signal pulses are displaced in the complex plane, with arbitrary amplitude and phase,\nrandomly chosen from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered at zero and with\nan adjustable variance VA N0 . The selected amplitude and phase values are set by computerdriven electro-optics amplitude and phase modulators placed in the signal path. Finally,\nafter part of the signal is removed for synchronization and system characterization purposes\n(see Section III B for details), Alice's desired modulation variance is adjusted with a second\namplitude modulator and a variable attenuator.\nTo avoid any polarization and phase drifts that may occur between the signal and LO\nover long-distance transmissions, and thus an incurred additional noise, both signal and LO\npulses need to travel in the same optical fiber. Because of the simplicity of the corresponding\nsetup, we have opted for time multiplexing, which is implemented by delaying the LO using\nan 80 m fiber in its path and then combining the signal and LO pulses at the output of\nAlice's setup, as shown in Fig. 2. Subsequently, the signal and LO pulses, separated by\n400 ns, are sent to Bob via the quantum channel, which is a standard single-mode optical\nfiber coil.\n10\n\n\fBob passively demultiplexes the signal and LO using a 90/10 fiber-optic coupler, thus\nintroducing a 10% loss in the signal. Then, Bob selects the quadrature to be measured by\nadjusting the measurement phase with a computer-driven phase modulator placed in the\nLO path. Another 80 m delay line, placed now in the signal path, results in the signal and\nLO pulses overlapping at the output beamsplitter of the interferometer. To ensure a good\ninterference contrast, the path difference between the signal and LO has to be adjusted to\nless than a centimeter. The selected quadrature measurement is then obtained with an allfiber shot-noise limited time-resolved pulsed homodyne detection system. This measurement\nconsists in the substraction of the photocurrents of two fast InGaAs photodiodes followed\nby a low noise charge amplifier and a constant gain amplifying stage.\nThe choice of the coupling ratios for the multiplexing and demultiplexing couplers of\nthe signal and LO in the described setup is the result of a trade-off. First, the intensity\nof the LO at the homodyne detection stage needs to be sufficiently high for the shot noise\nto be significantly higher than the electronic noise of the detector. Typically, more than\n107 photons per pulse are required for this purpose. Second, signal losses at Bob's site\nneed to be minimized because they directly contribute to errors that decrease the mutual\ninformation between Alice and Bob. The coupling ratios quoted in Fig. 2 reflect this trade-off\nand fulfill the intensity level constraints and the stability requirements of the system.\n\nB.\n\nSystem automation\n\nAlice and Bob communicate via a synchronous automatic data processing software, described in detail in [26]. A key transmission is composed of independent blocks containing\n50 000 pulses. Among these pulses, 10 000 are used as test pulses which have agreed amplitude and phase values, and serve the dual purpose of synchronizing Alice and Bob and\ndetermining the relative phase between the signal and the LO. An additional random subset\nof the raw data, typically 5 000 pulses, is used for statistical evaluation of the channel parameters, namely the channel transmission T and the excess noise \u03b5, over this subset. In addition,\nthe signal level sent by Alice and LO level received by Bob are monitored in real-time on\nan individual pulse basis. Note that monitoring the LO level for each pulse also serves the\npurpose of avoiding potential \"side-channel\" attacks which might tamper classically with\nthe LO intensity. When combined with an appropriate calibration, these measurements\n11\n\n\fallow us to obtain an accurate estimate of the shot noise level at Bob's site, which is used\nas a normalization factor. From this calibration, we can then determine the second order\nmoments of the data distribution between Alice and Bob: VA N0 , VB N0 , and the correlation\n\u03c1. These moments yield the channel parameters T and \u03b5, and the information rates. It is\nimportant to point out that T is measured both using test pulses of fixed amplitude and a\nsubset of the raw data, and the agreement between the two values is continuously checked.\nTaking into account the fraction of pulses used in each block for synchronization and system\ncharacterization, the repetition rate effectively used for key distribution is 350 kHz. We note\nthat higher repetition rates up to 1 MHz have been implemented.\nWe have designed a software that both manages the interface between Alice and Bob and\nensures proper hardware operation, with features aiming towards the complete automation\nof the CVQKD system. A software feedforward loop automatically adjusts every 10 seconds the bias voltages that need to be applied to the amplitude modulators in Alice's site,\nthus compensating for thermal drifts that occur in the timescale of a few minutes. Furthermore, Alice's output modulation variance is stabilized and controlled by a software loop to\nprevent natural drifts of the system from modifying the signal to noise ratio (SNR). This\nkeeps the SNR within the range compatible with the reconciliation codes. At Bob's site,\nanother software drives Bob's phase generator, using binary numbers provided by a quantum\nrandom number generator (id Quantique). This chosen phase is later compensated by the\nmeasurement of the relative phase between the signal and LO. The implementation of these\nautomated procedures ensures a stable and reliable system operation with minimal human\nintervention. Finally, with the exception of the 50/50 coupler at the input of the homodyne\ndetection system, the setups of Alice and Bob consist entirely of polarization-maintaining\ncomponents. This means that polarization control is only required before the homodyne\ndetector, and to compensate for polarization drifts in the quantum channel. The use of\na polarization-maintaining homodyne detector and a software-driven low-loss dynamic polarization controller placed at the input of Bob's setup allows the implementation of the\nrequired compensation while only inducing reasonable losses to the signal, and leads to fully\nautomatic operation of the QKD system.\n\n12\n\n\fC.\n\nExperimental parameters and noise analysis\n\nIn the previous sections we have described a system that produces correlated Gaussiandistributed continuous variables at an effective rate of 350 kHz. In order to obtain the raw\nkey distribution rate from these correlations, we need to evaluate the losses and noise sources\nthat are present in the system and degrade its performance. At Alice's site, several sources\nof loss are present in the signal path, namely modulators (2.5 dB each), polarizers (0.3 dB),\nconnectors (0.2 dB) or couplers. These losses do not affect the system performance because\nthe signal level is set at Alice's output. However, the losses in the LO path need to be\ncontrolled so that the intensity level is sufficient for the homodyne detection measurement,\nas we discussed in Section III A. The quantum channel is a 25 km single-mode optical fiber,\nwhich presents a loss of 5.2 dB. At Bob's site, the losses of the components in the signal\npath deteriorate the transmission signal to noise ratio (SNR) and thus the amount of key\ninformation exchanged between Alice and Bob. Therefore, these losses must be minimized.\nTo benefit from the \"realistic mode\" assumption described in Section II, it is important\nto carefully calibrate Bob's setup efficiency \u03b7 because overestimating this value could open\na security loophole in the system. The present overall efficiency, including the homodyne\ndetection efficiency, is \u03b7 = 0.606. Taking into account the measured value T = 0.302 for the\nchannel transmission efficiency, we find that the overall transmission between Alice and Bob\nis \u03b7T = 0.183.\nIn addition to the noise introduced by the channel and homodyne detection losses, an\nexcess noise due to technical limitations as well as an electronic noise introduced by the\nhomodyne detection system are present in the system. The noises contributing to the excess noise \u03b5 can be independently determined from the experimental data, and lead to an\nexcess noise of \u03b5 = 0.005 shot noise units for a modulation variance VA N0 = 18.5N0 . As\ndiscussed in Section III B, during key transmission the excess noise is measured by the data\nprocessing software. This measurement was checked experimentally with the implementation of an intercept and resend attack, where we expect an excess noise of two shot noise\nunits, corresponding to the \"entanglement breaking\" bound for the coherent-state CVQKD\nprotocol [27]. It is important to point out that, in principle, the excess noise is not caused\nby Eve and could be considered inaccessible to her. However, because the diode phase noise\nand the modulation noises depend on the modulation settings, it is difficult to accurately\n13\n\n\festimate and calibrate this excess noise. Thus, to avoid compromising the security of our\nimplementation we assume that it is in fact generated and controlled by Eve. Finally, the\nhomodyne detector electronic noise contributes vel = 0.041 shot noise units to the total\nnoise.\nWith the help of the equations given in Section II, the noise measurements described\nabove lead to the raw secret rates:\nIAB = 365 kb/s,\n\nIBE = 313 kb/s\n\n\u2206IShannon = 52 kb/s\nIAB = 365 kb/s,\n\n\u03c7BE = 316 kb/s\n\n\u2206IHolevo = 49 kb/s\nTo obtain a secret key from this information, available in the form of raw Gaussian\ncorrelated data, we have to efficiently extract a string of secret bits from this data. This is\nthe subject of the next section, which focuses on the Shannon rate. A very similar procedure\ncan be applied to the Holevo rate.\n\nIV.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF CONTINUOUS GAUSSIAN VARIABLES\n\nIn photon-counting based QKD protocols, data is readily available as binary digits and\ncan be easily processed for error correction and privacy amplification using well-known protocols such as Cascade [28] or Winnow [29]. The amount of secret key that can be extracted\nfrom these error-correction algorithms depends on the error rate of the noisy key. On the\nother hand, continuous-variable QKD protocols only provide Alice and Bob with sequences\nof correlated Gaussian symbols, from which various noise variances are determined [27]. In\nparticular, the variance of the excess noise is the analog of the error rate in photon-counting\nQKD protocols. From these variances, the mutual informations IAB and IBE can be deduced,\nand thus the secret key rate. Therefore, for CVQKD protocols high secret key distribution\nrates are attainable, provided that the secret information \u2206I Shannon = IAB \u2212 IBE available\nfrom the raw Gaussian data can be efficiently extracted. From a strict information-theoretic\nperspective there exists no fundamental limitations to this extraction process. However, in\npractice, error correction requires more information exchange than predicted by Shannon's\ntheory. The raw secret information rate is therefore decreased to the effective secret rate\n14\n\n\fShannon\n\u2206Ieff\n= \u03b2IAB \u2212 IBE , where the efficiency \u03b2 < 1 characterizes how close the reconcil-\n\niation algorithm operates with respect to the Shannon limit (see Section IV A). Since the\nmaximum achievable transmission distance ultimately depends on the value of \u03b2, designing\nefficient reconciliation algorithms is one of the challenges of CVQKD. The efficiency of the\nfirst reconciliation algorithms used for CVQKD [30, 31] did not reach 80% for significant\nline losses, which limited the maximum transmission distance to less than 20 km. In what\nfollows, we first briefly review the key principles of a more efficient algorithm presented\nin [32], and then focus on its practical implementation.\n\nA.\n\nMultilevel reverse reconciliation with Low-Density Parity-Check codes\n\nLet X denote the random variable representing Alice's Gaussian symbols and Y the\none representing Bob's symbols. In theory Alice and Bob should be able to extract up\nto I(X; Y ) common bits from their correlated sequence. Following the idea of [30], Bob\nfirst quantizes his data to obtain discrete symbols, represented by the variable Q(Y ), and\nassigns a binary label to each of them. The quantization necessarily reduces the amount of\nextractable information I(X, Q(Y )) < I(X; Y ); however, the penalty can be made negligible\nby choosing the quantizer Q to maximize the mutual information I(X; Q(Y )). In order to\nallow Alice to recover his bit sequence without errors, Bob should then send redundant\ninformation, such as the value of parity-check equations. The theoretical number of such\nredundancy bits is H(Q(Y )|X) [33], however in practice perfect error correction is only\npossible when the number of bits disclosed Mrec exceeds this limit. The efficiency \u03b2 of a\npractical reconciliation algorithm is then defined as:\n\u03b2=\n\nH(Q(Y )) \u2212 Mrec\nI(X; Q(Y ))\n\u2264\n\u2264 1.\nI(X; Y )\nI(X; Y )\n\n(13)\n\nThe principle of our reconciliation scheme is shown in Fig. 3. Once his Gaussian symbols\n{yi } have been quantized into {Q(yi )}, Bob assigns a L-bits binary label {lj (yi )}j=0..L\u22121 to\neach of them, and calculates a set of parity bits (or syndromes) for each individual level j\nof label bits. In our case, the number of levels in the multilevel reconciliation is L = 4. This\nparticular encoding incurs no loss of performance, and the ideal number of parity bits to\ndisclose at each level can be precisely calculated [32]. The levels corresponding to the less\nsignificant bits often require almost as many parity bits as there are data bits, and in this case\n15\n\n\fBob\nyi\nContinuous\ndata\n\nl2 (yi)\n\nquantization\n\nQ(yi )\n\nbit labeling\n\nl0 (yi )\n\nl1 (yi)\n\nl2 (yi)\n\nl3 (yi)\n\nLDPC syndrome\ncalculation\n\nl3 (yi)\n\nLDPC syndrome\ncalculation\n\nBCH syndrome\ncalculation\n\ndisclosed levels\n\nxi\nContinuous\ndata\n\nLDPC\ndecoder\nLDPC\ndecoder\n\nBCH\ndecoder\n\nl2d\n(yi)\n\nl3d\n(yi)\n\nError\u2212free bits\n\nAlice\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Principle of multilevel reconciliation with LDPC codes.\n\nBob can simply disclose the entire level. For the levels corresponding to more significant bits,\nthe parity bits are calculated according to the parity-check matrix of Low Density Parity\nCheck (LDPC) codes. Finally, a few extra parity bits are obtained by applying an algebraic\ncode (such as a BCH code [34]) to the whole data sequence.\nAlice retrieves Bob's bit sequence by decoding the bit levels successively, using her Gaussian symbols {xi } and the syndromes sent by Bob. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the decoding of a\nlevel also exploits the results obtained at the decoding of the previous levels. The standard\ndecoding algorithm of LDPC codes (Sum-Product [35]) may sometimes leave a few errors\nuncorrected, however the parity bits obtained with the algebraic code are usually sufficient\nto correct them.\nIn comparison with the algorithm proposed in [30], which introduced slice reconciliation\nwith turbo codes, the good efficiency obtained with this algorithm stems from three key\nfeatures. First, codes applied at each level are state-of-the-art LDPC error correcting codes.\nThen, the reliability associated to the decision (so-called soft decoding) output from these\ncodes is used as an a priori for the decoding of other levels, rather than only the bit estimate\nissued by each decoder. Finally, we allow several iterations between the levels. In fact, soft\ndecoding enables us to start the decoding of a level j even if the previous level j \u2212 1 has\nnot been successfully corrected. A later attempt at decoding level j \u2212 1 might benefit from\na partial decoding of level j and could terminate successfully. In addition, the exchange\nof information during the whole reconciliation process is unidirectional, which leaves no\nambiguity on the information intercepted by the eavesdropper.\nIt was shown in [32], that LDPC codes with a block length of 200 000 bits were sufficient\nto achieve efficiencies above 85% over a wide range of SNR.\n16\n\n\fThe efficiency \u03b2 characterizes the ultimate performance of a reconciliation algorithm,\nhowever it only assesses its performance from an information-theoretic standpoint and does\nnot account for the associated computational complexity. In practice, the latter is of uttermost importance if one hopes to obtain high secret key distribution rates. Before going on to\nthe details of the implementation of our algorithm, it is worthwhile discussing the trade-off\nbetween efficiency and decoding complexity. Increasing the reconciliation efficiency while\nstill maintaining an arbitrarily low probability of decoding error would require LDPC codes\noperating closer to the Shannon limit as well as many more iterations in the decoding process. It is clear that the code block length and decoding complexity of this scheme would\nthen quickly become prohibitive. However, a better trade-off can be obtained by maintaining\nan arbitrarily low probability of undetected errors. In fact, if the reconciliation algorithm\ndetects all decoding failures with high probability but fails to correct errors with probability\nShannon\npfail , the effective secret information rate becomes \u2206Ieff\n= (\u03b2IAB \u2212 IBE ) (1 \u2212 pfail ). It\n\nis difficult to obtain an analytical expression of pfail as a function of \u03b2 due to the iterative\nnature of the decoding process, however we observed via Monte-Carlo simulation that \u03b2\ncould be increased by a few percents without too much sacrifice on pfail . Table I shows\nour simulation results obtained for a mutual information I(X; Y ) = 1 bit/symbol, a 4-bit\nquantization, length 200 000 LDPC codes, and for a BCH code rate of 0.998 to obtain the\nextra parity bits. No undetected errors appeared during the simulations.\n\nB.\n\nPractical implementation\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the efficiency of the reconciliation strongly depends on how close\nthe LDPC codes operate with respect to their ideal limit. High efficiency is therefore only\nachievable with relatively large block length (typically over 100 000 bits) and randomly constructed codes [35], which makes a hardware implementation of the algorithm unrealistic. To\ndate, high decoding throughputs on Field Programmable Gated Arrays (FPGAs) have only\nLDPC code rates\n\n\u03b2\n\npfail\n\n0/0/0.42/0.94\n\n86.7%\n\n0\n\n0/0/0.44/0.94\n\n88.7% 10\u22124\n\nTABLE I: Simulation results.\n\n17\n\n\fbeen obtained with structured short length codes, which specific structure allowed a certain\namount of parallelism. In our situation, a software implementation of the algorithm turned\nout to be the only viable solution. Typical software implementations of the Sum-Product\ndecoding algorithm are rather slow, however the execution speed can be substantially improved by performing fixed-point operations and approximating computationally intensive\nfunctions with table look-ups [36]. These simplifications yield a significant overall speed\ngain with a negligible performance degradation. The convergence speed of the LDPC codes\ncan also be accelerated by using a modified version of the standard Sum-Product decoding\nalgorithm [37]. A simple change in the scheduling of the decoding reduces the number of\niterations by a factor almost two without any penalty in terms of performance.\nIn the situation of interest for CVQKD, most of the complexity of the reconciliation\nalgorithm comes from the use of two LDPC codes of same block length. The decoding\ncomplexity depends on many parameters, such as the number of iterations performed during\nthe decoding of each code, the number of times each level is decoded, the average number of\nterms involved in parity-check equations, etc. For a desired level of performance, there exists\nno generic method for finding a set of parameters minimizing the complexity because all\nparameters interplay in a complex manner. For instance, choosing \"better\" codes operating\ncloser to the Shannon limit could reduce the number of iterations required in each LDPC\ndecoder, but the size of the parity-check equations would generally increase. Likewise,\nincreasing the number of iterations within a LDPC decoder may sometimes reduce the\nnumber of iterations required between different decoders. Hence the choice of the parameters\ndescribed hereafter results from many heuristic optimizations.\n\nC.\n\nOptimal reconciliation parameters\n\nAlthough code parameters cannot be deduced from an analytical calculation, the optimal\nmodulation variance is the result of a quantitative compromise. The reconciliation efficiency\nonly depends on the SNR of the transmission, which, for a given distance, is an increasing\nfunction of the modulation variance VA N0 .

We assume a linear dependence of \u03b5 on VA , and use\nthe experimental parameters given in Section III. The curves show the key distribution rate for\nvalues of \u03b2 ranging from 0.6 to 1.0, and the filled circles show the efficiency we actually achieve for\ndifferent SNR.\n\ntion efficiency above 80%, we obtained the best performance/complexity trade-off with the\nfollowing parameters:\n\u2022 modulation variance VA N0 = 18.5N0 (I(X; Y ) = 1.045 bit/symbol),\n\u2022 quantization with 16 equally spaced intervals (I(X; Q(Y )) = 1.019 bit/symbol), ideally requiring 4 codes with rates 0.002/0.013/0.456/0.981,\n\u2022 practical codes rates 0/0/0.42/0.95, yielding an efficiency \u03b2 = 0.898.\nThese reconciliation parameters are adjusted as the line parameters (namely the excess\nnoise) fluctuate, and yield the following secret key distribution rates:\n= 12.3 kb/s\n\u2206IHolevo\neff\n\n\u2206IShannon\n= 15.2 kb/s\neff\n\nSince the LDPC codes are very demanding in computing power, the reconciliation speed is\ndirectly affected by the processor speed. The use of one core of a dedicated Core 2 Duo Intel\nprocessor leads to a reconciliation speed of 40 000 Gaussian symbols/s, while using a NVidia\nGTX 7950 graphics processor allows a speed of 63 000 symbols/s, to be compared with the\ncurrent repetition rate of 350 000 symbols/s. Taking into account this speed limitation, the\nfinal (net) secure key distribution rates are:\nUsing a Core 2 Duo CPU:\n19\n\n\f\u2206IShannon\n= 1.7 kb/s\nnet\n\n\u2206IHolevo\n= 1.4 kb/s\nnet\n\nUsing a GTX 7950 GPU:\n\u2206IShannon\n= 2.7 kb/s\nnet\n\n\u2206IHolevo\n= 2.2 kb/s\nnet\n\nWe note that the reconciliation procedure described above has been optimized for the\ncase of the Shannon entropy, and further optimization should be considered to achieve a\nhigher Holevo rate.\n\nV.\n\nPRIVACY AMPLIFICATION\n\nAt the end of the reconciliation process, the classical error correction algorithm outputs\nblocks of b = 400 000 bits (i.e the two most significant quantization levels of blocks of\nn = 200 000 continuous variables), and each of them needs to be compressed into a much\nshorter secret key of typically k = 10 000 secret bits, depending on the measured secret\nkey distribution rate. In order not to affect the overall classical processing speed, this\nparticularly large input size requires us to use fast privacy amplification algorithms. Privacy\namplification [38] consists in randomly choosing a hash function mapping bit strings of length\nb to bit strings of length k, among a suitable set of these functions called a family. The\nprobability of success of these algorithms is characterized by the universality \u01eb of the family\nof hash functions, and the security parameter s, i.e. the number of bits that are sacrificed\nduring the amplification process. Quantitatively, the probability that Eve knows one bit of\nthe final key is about max(2\u2212s , \u01eb \u2212 1) [39]. For universal families of hash functions, defined\nby \u01eb = 1, only the security parameter s is therefore relevant. The size of the resulting secret\nShannon\nkey is then k = n\u2206Ieff\n\u2212 s.\n\nThe simplest practical universal family of hash functions is the multiplication by a random\nelement of the Galois field GF (2l ) with l > b [38]. The number theoretic transform (NTT),\na FFT-like algorithm in GF (2l ) enables us to rapidly perform this multiplication [39]. Still,\nthe amplification of 400 000 bits with this algorithm takes about 10 seconds on an average\ndesktop computer, which is about as long as the whole reconciliation process, thus significantly decreasing the final secret key rate.\nTo avoid this long computation time, we use instead a non-universal family of hash\nfunctions based on the NTT described in [39] (section 7.3.3). In this algorithm, we first\n20\n\n\fconvert the incoming bit string into a vector of Lp elements of the Galois field GF (p)\n(Lp = 214 and p = 33 832 961 are suitable for our input string length). Then we compute the\ninverse NTT of the component-wise product of the generated vector with a random vector\nwith no zero element. The hash output is then obtained by converting back the result to a bit\nstring, which is then truncated to the desired key length. This hash function evaluation only\nrequires a few tens of milliseconds, but its universality is \u01eb1 = 1 +\n\nk\np\n\n\u2243 1 + 5 * 10\u22124 , allowing\n\nfor security parameters up to only about 10. To overcome this problem, we combine this\nalgorithm with the universal (\u01eb2 = 1) family of hash functions based on the multiplication\nin GF (2m ). For this, we first non-universally hash our b bits into m = 19 937 bits for which\nwe know a Galois field, and then universally hash these resulting bits into k \u2243 10 000 bits.\nAlthough this second hashing algorithm is much slower, the execution time is still tolerable\ndue to the reduced input size. The universality of the total composite hashing is \u01ebc =\n2k\u221219 937 \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 [40], and so \u01ebc \u2212 1 is small enough to allow virtually any reasonable security\nparameter. On a desktop computer, the total hashing time is 0.27 s per block, of which 0.2 s\nare consumed by the second hashing.\n\nVI.\n\nGENERATION OF A SECRET KEY OVER A 25 KM LONG FIBER\n\nTo finalize our CVQKD system, we designed a software implementing the classical channel between Alice and Bob. This software continuously retrieves Gaussian data from the\nsoftware driving the experiment, and performs error correction and privacy amplification.\nIt features an authentication backend interface that is currently using the authentication\nalgorithms developed by the European Integrated Project SECOQC [41]. With the system\ndescribed in the previous sections, which combines CVQKD hardware and key distillation\nsoftware, we have been able to transmit a binary secret key over a 25 km long fiber coil\nwith a final secret key distribution rate of 2 kb/s. This rate takes into account the entire\nkey distillation procedure, including the classical channel latency. By evaluating our transmission parameters for different channel transmissions we obtain the raw and effective key\ndistribution rate curves shown in Fig. 5.\n\n21\n\n\f6\n\nSecure key rate (bit/s) at 350 kHz\n\n10\n\nShannon raw key rate\n\n5\n\n10\n\nHolevo raw key rate\n\n4\n\n10\n\nHolevo effective key rate\n\u03b2 = 0.898\n3\n\n10\n\nShannon effective key rate\n\u03b2 = 0.898\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nDistance (km)\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Raw and effective key distribution rates for communication secure against\nindividual (Shannon) and collective (Holevo) attacks. The reconciliation efficiency for the effective\nkey distribution rates is assumed to be \u03b2 = 0.898. The parameters used in the calculations are\nVA N0 = 18.5N0 , \u03b5 = 0.005, \u03b7 = 0.606, vel = 0.041, the effective repetition rate is 350 kHz, and the\nfiber loss is assumed to be 0.2 dB/km.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have presented the implementation of a complete continuous-variable\nquantum key distribution system, generating secret keys at a rate of more than 2 kb/s\nover 25 km of optical fiber. The system is secure against individual and collective attacks,\nwhen using Shannon or Holevo information bounds, respectively. A single program drives\nhardware automation, signal modulation and measurement, and performs authentication,\nreverse reconciliation, and privacy amplification. Our QKD setup is therefore fully functional\nand meets all aspects required for a field implementation.\nCurrently, the secret key rate is limited by data processing and data acquisition, rather\nthan by optical components. Further improvements of the reconciliation algorithms, as well\nas the use of faster components (CPUs and data acquisition cards), should thus lead to a\ndirect enhancement of the key rate.\n\n22\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge contributions of C\u00e9cile Neu to the initial versions of the communication\nsoftware, and improvements by Andr\u00e9 Villing to the system electronics, especially concerning\nthe homodyne detector.
