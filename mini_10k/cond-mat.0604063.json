Disordered ultracold quantum gases\n\nStudies of disordered systems constitute a new, rapidly developing, branch of the physics of ultracold gases. In condensed matter physics (CM), the role of quenched (i.e. independent of time) disorder cannot be overestimated: it is\npresent in nearly all CM systems, and leads to numerous phenomena that dramatically change both qualitative and quantitave behaviours of these systems. This leads, for instance, to\nnovel thermodynamical and quantum phases1,2 , and to strong\nphenomena, such as Anderson localization3\u20136 . In general,\ndisorder can hardly be controlled in CM systems. In contrast, it has been proposed recently, that quenched disorder\n(or pseudo-disorder) can be introduced in a controlled way in\nultracold atomic systems, using optical potentials generated\nby speckle radiations7\u20139 , impurity atoms serving as random\nscatterers10 , or quasi-cristalline lattices11 . This opens fantastic\npossibilities to investigate the effect of disorder in controlled\nsystems (for a review in the context of cold gases, see Ref. 12).\nRecently, several groups have initiated the experimental study\nof disorder with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)13\u201315 , and\nstrongly correlated Bose gases16 . In the center of interest of\nthese works is one of the most fundamental issues of disordered systems that concerns the interplay between Anderson\nlocalization and interactions in many body Fermi or Bose systems at low temperatures. In non-interacting atomic sytems,\nlocalization is feasible experimentally17, but even weak interactions can drastically change the scenario. While weak repulsive interactions tend to delocalize, strong ones in confined\ngeometries lead to Wigner-Mott-like localization18 . Both experiments and theory indicate that in gaseous systems with\nlarge interactions, stronger localization effects occur in the\nexcitations of a BEC14,19\u201321 , rather than on the BEC wavefunction itself. In the limit of weak interactions, a Bose gase\n\nenters a Lifshits glass phase, in which several BECs in various localized single atom orbitals from the low energy tail of\nthe spectrum coexist22 (for 'traces' of the Lifshits glass in the\nmeanfield theory, see Ref. 15). Finally, note that disorder in\nFermi gases, or in Femi-Bose atomic mixtures, should allow\none to realize various fermionic disorderded phases, such as\na Fermi glass, a Mott-Wigner glass, 'dirty' superconductors,\netc. (Ref. 12), or even quantum spin glasses23 .\n\nB. Large effects by small disorder\n\nOne of the most appealing effects of disorder is that even\nextremely small randomness can have dramatic consequences.\nThe paradigm example in classical physics is the Ising model\nfor which an arbitrarily small random magnetic field destroys\nmagnetization even at temperature T=0 in two dimensions, 2D\n(Refs. 24,25), but not in D > 2 (Ref. 26). This result has\nbeen generalized to systems with continuous symmetry in random fields distributed in accordance with this symmetry24,25 .\nFor instance, the Heisenberg model in a SO(3)-symmetrically\ndistributed field does not magnetize up to 4D.\nIn quantum physics, the paradigm example of large effects induced by small disorder is provided by the abovementioned Anderson localization which occurs in 1D and 2D\nin arbitrarily small random potentials5 . In this paper, we propose an even more intriguing opposite effect, where disorder counter-intuitively favors ordering: a general mechanism\nof random-field-induced order (RFIO) by which certain spin\nmodels magnetize at a higher temperature in the presence of\narbitrarily small disorder than in its absence, provided that the\ndisorder breaks the continuous symmetry of the system.\n\n\f2\nC. Main results and plan of the paper\n\nAs is well known, as a consequence of the Mermin-WagnerHohenberg theorem27 , spin or field theoretic systems with\ncontinuous symmetry in dimensions less or equal to 2D cannot exhibit long range order. The mechanism that we propose here breaks the continuous symmetry, and in this sense\nacts against the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg no-go rule in 2D.\nIn particular, we prove rigorously that the classical XY spin\nmodel on a 2D lattice in a uniaxial random field magnetizes\nspontaneously at T = 0 in the direction perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field axis, and provide strong evidence that this is\nalso the case at small positive temperatures. We discuss generalizations of this mechanism to classical and quantum XY\nand Heisenberg models in 2D and 3D. In 3D, the considered\nsystems do exhibit long range order at finite T > 0, but in\nthis case the critical temperature decreases with the 'size' of\nthe symmetry group: it is the largest for the Ising model (the\ndiscrete group Z2 ), higher for the XY model [the continuous group U (1)], and the highest for the Heisenberg model\n[the continuous group SU (2), or SO(3)]. In this case we expect that our mechanism will lead to an increase of the critical temperature for the XY and Heisenberg models, and to\nan increase of the order parameter value at a fixed temperature\nfor the disordered system in comparison to the non-disordered\none. Finally, we propose three possible and experimentally\nfeasible realizations of the RFIO phenomenon using ultracold\natoms in optical lattices.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, we present\nthe results concerning the RFIO in the classical XY model on\na 2D lattice. First, we rigorously prove that the system magnetizes in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the random magnetic field at T = 0, and then, we present arguments\nthat the magnetization persists in small T > 0 case, as well\nas the results of numerical classical Monte Carlo simulations.\nSection III is fully devoted to the discussion of the generalizations of the RFIO mechanism to several other classical and\nquantum spin systems. In section IV, we discuss several experimentally feasible realizations of RFIO in ultracold atomic\nsystems. Finally, we summarize our results in section V.\n\nII. RFIO IN CLASSICAL XY MODEL\nA. The system under study\n\nConsider a classical spin system on the 2D square lattice\nZ2 , in a random magnetic field, h (see Fig. 1). The spin variable, \u03c3i = (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i ), at a site i \u2208 Z2 is a unit vector\nin the xy plane. The Hamiltonian (in units of the exchange\nenergy J) is given by\nH/J = \u2212\n\nX\n\n|i\u2212j|=1\n\n\u03c3i * \u03c3j \u2212 \u01eb\n\nX\ni\n\nhi * \u03c3i .\n\n(1)\n\nHere the first term is the standard nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY-model, and the second term represents a small\n\nFigure 1: (color online) XY model on a 2D square lattice in a random\nmagnetic field. The magnetic field is oriented along the y axis, hi =\n\u03b7i ey , where \u03b7i is a real random number. Right boundary conditions\nare assumed on the outer square, possibly placed at infinity (see text).\n\nrandom field perturbation. The hi 's are assumed to be independent, identically distributed random, 2D vectors.\nFor \u01eb = 0, the model has no spontaneous magnetization, m,\nat any positive T . This was first pointed out in Ref. 28, and\nlater developed into a class of results known as the MerminWagner-Hohenberg theorem27 for various classical, as well as\nquantum two-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry. In higher dimensions the system does magnetize at low\ntemperatures. This follows from the spin wave analysis29 , and\nhas been given a rigorous proof in Ref. 30. The impact of\na random field term on the behavior of the model was first\naddressed in Refs. 24,25, where it was argued that if the distribution of the random variables hi is invariant under rotations, there is no spontaneous magnetization at any positive T\nin any dimension D \u2264 4. A rigorous proof of this statement\nwas given in Ref. 25. Both works use crucially the rotational\ninvariance of the distribution of the random field variables.\nHere we consider the case where hi is directed along the yaxis: hi = \u03b7i ey , where ey is the unit vector in the y direction,\nand \u03b7i is a random real number. Such a random field obviously\nbreaks the continuous symmetry of the interaction and a question arises whether the model still has no spontaneous magnetization in two dimensions. This question has been given\ncontradictory answers in Refs. 31,32: while Ref. 31 predicts\nthat a small random field in the y-direction does not change\nthe behavior of the model, Ref. 32 argues that it leads to the\npresence of spontaneous magnetization, m, in the direction\nperpendicular to the random field axis in low (but not arbitrarily low) temperatures. Both works use renormalization group\nanalysis, with Ref. 32 starting from a version of the Imry-Ma\nscaling argument to prove that the model magnetizes at zero\ntemperature.\nThe same model was subsequently studied by Feldman33,\nusing ideas similar to the argument given in the present paper.\nAs we argue below, however, his argument contains an essential gap, which is filled in the present work. We first present a\ncomplete proof that the system indeed magnetizes at T = 0,\n\n\f3\nand argue that the ground state magnetization is stable under\ninclusion of small thermal fluctuations. For this, we use a version of the Peierls contour argument34, eliminating first the\npossibility that Bloch walls or vortex configurations destroy\nthe transition.\n\nB. RFIO at T = 0\n\nLet us start by a rigorous analysis of the ground state. Consider the system in a square \u039b with the 'right' boundary conditions, \u03c3i = (1, 0), for the sites i on the outer boundary of \u039b\n(see Fig. 1). The energy of any spin configuration decreases\nif we replace the x components of the spins by their absolute\nvalues and leave the y components unchanged. It follows that\nin the ground state, x components of all the spins are nonnegative. As the size of the system increases, we expect the x\ncomponent of the ground state spins to decrease, since they\nfeel less influence of the boundary conditions and the ground\nstate value of each spin will converge. We thus obtain a welldefined infinite-volume ground state with the 'right' boundary\nconditions at infinity.\nWe emphasize that the above convergence statement is nontrivial and requires a proof. Physically it is, however, quite\nnatural. A similar statement has been rigorously proven for\nground states of the Random Field Ising Model using FortuinKasteleyn-Ginibre monotonicity techniques25,35 .\n\nC. Infinite volume limit\n\nA priori this infinite-volume ground state could coincide\nwith the ground state of the Random Field Ising Model, in\nwhich all spins have zero x component. The following argument shows that this is not the case. Suppose that the spin \u03c3i\nat a given site i is aligned along the y-axis, i.e. cos \u03b8i = 0.\nSince the derivative of the energy function with respect to \u03b8i\nvanishes at the minimum, we obtain\nX\nsin(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) = 0.\n(2)\nj:|i\u2212j|=1\n\nP\nSince cos \u03b8i = 0, this implies j:|i\u2212j|=1 cos \u03b8j = 0. Because\nin the 'right' ground state all spins lie in the (closed) right\nhalf-plane x \u2265 0, all terms in the above expression are nonnegative and hence have to vanish. This means that at all the\nnearest neighbors j of the site i, the ground state spins are directed along the y-axis as well. Repeating this argument, we\nconclude that the same holds for all spins of the infinite lattice, i.e. the ground state is the (unique) Random Field Ising\nModel ground state. This, however, leads to a contradiction,\nsince assuming this, one can construct a field configuration,\noccurring with a positive probability, which forces the ground\nstate spins to have nonzero x components. To achieve this\nwe put strong positive (\u03b7i > 0) fields on the boundary of a\nsquare and strong negative fields on the boundary of a concentric smaller square. If the fields are very weak in the area\nbetween the two boundaries, the spins will form a Bloch wall,\n\nrotating gradually from \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 to \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2. Since such\na local field configuration occurs with a positive probability,\nthe ground state cannot have zero x components everywhere,\ncontrary to our assumption.\nWe would like to emphasize the logical structure of the\nabove argument, which proceeds indirectly assuming that the\nground state spins (or, equivalently, at least one of them) have\nzero x components and reach a contradiction. The initial assumption is used in an essential way to argue existence of the\nBloch wall interpolating between spins with y components\nequal to +1 and \u22121. It is this part of the argument that we\nthink is missing in Ref. 33. Note, that this argument applies\nto strong, as well as to weak random fields, so that the ground\nstate is never, strictly speaking, field-dominated and always\nexhibits magnetization in the x-direction. Moreover, the argument does not depend on the dimension of the system, applying in particular in one dimension. We argue below that in\ndimensions greater than one the effect still holds at small positive temperatures, the critical temperature depending on the\nstrength of the random field (and presumably going to zero as\nthe strength of the field increases).\n\nD. RFIO at low positive T\n\nTo study the system at low positive T , we need to ask what\nare the typical low energy excitations from the ground state.\nFor \u01eb = 0, continuous symmetry allows Bloch walls, i.e. configurations in which the spins rotate gradually over a large\nregion, for instance from left to right. The total excitation\nenergy of a Bloch wall in 2D is of order one, and it is the presence of such walls that underlies the absence of continuous\nsymmetry breaking. However, for \u01eb > 0, a Bloch wall carries\nadditional energy, coming from the change of the direction of\nthe y component of the spin, which is proportional to the area\nof the wall (which is of the order L2 for a wall of linear size L\nin two dimensions), since the ground state spins are adapted\nto the field configuration, and hence overturning them will increase the energy per site. Similarly, vortex configurations,\nwhich are important low-energy excitations in the nonrandom\nXY model, are no longer energetically favored in the presence\nof a uniaxial random field.\nWe are thus left, as possible excitations, with sharp domain\nwalls, where the x component of the spin changes sign rapidly.\nTo first approximation we consider excited configurations, in\nwhich spins take either their ground state values, or the reflections of these values in the y-axis. As in the standard Peierls\nargument34, in the presence of the right boundary conditions,\nsuch configurations can be described in terms of contours \u03b3\n(domain walls), separating spins with positive and negative x\ncomponents. If mi is the value of the x component of the spin\n\u03c3i in the ground state with the right boundary conditions, the\nenergy of a domain wall is the sum of mi mj over the bonds\n(ij) crossing the boundary of the contour. Since changing the\nsigns of the x components of the spins does not change the\nmagnetic field contribution to the energy, the Peierls estimate\nshows that thePprobability of such a contour is bounded above\nby exp(\u22122\u03b2 (ij) mi mj ), with \u03b2 = J/kB T .\n\n\fWe want to show that for a typical realization of the field, h,\n(i.e. with probability one), these probabilities are summable,\ni.e. their sum over all contours containing the origin in their\ninterior is finite. It then follows that at a still lower T , this\nsum is small, and the Peierls argument proves that the system\nmagnetizes (in fact, a simple additional argument shows that\nsummability of the contour probabilities already implies the\nexistence of spontaneous m). To show that a series of random variables is summable with probability one, it suffices to\nprove the summability of the series of the expected values. We\npresent two arguments for the last statement to hold.\nIf the random\nvariables mi are bounded away from zero,\n\u221a\ni.e. mi > c, for some c >P0, the moment generating function of the random variable (ij) mi mj satisfies\n\u0011i\nh\n\u0010\nX\n(3)\nmi mj \u2264 exp[\u2212c\u03b2L(\u03b3)],\nE exp \u2212 \u03b2\n(ij)\n\nwith L(\u03b3) denoting the length of the contour \u03b3. The sum\nof the probabilities\nPof the contours enclosing the origin is\nthus bounded by \u03b3 exp[\u2212c\u03b2L(\u03b3)]. The standard PeierlsGriffiths bound proves the desired summability.\nThe above argument does not apply if the distribution of the ground state, m, contains zero in its support.\nFor unbounded distribution of the random field\nthis may very well be the case, and then another argument\nP is needed. If we assume that the terms in the sum\n(ij) mi mj are independent and identically distributed, then\nP\nE[exp(\u22122\u03b2 (ij) mi mj )] = E[exp(\u22122\u03b2mi mj )]L(\u03b3) =\nexp{L(\u03b3) log E[exp(\u22122\u03b2mi mj )]} and we just need to observe that E[exp(\u22122\u03b2mi mj )] \u2192 0 as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e (since\nthe expression under the expectation sign goes pointwise\nto zero andP lies between 0 and 1) to conclude that\nE[exp(\u22122\u03b2 (ij) mi mj )] behaves as exp[\u2212g(\u03b2)L(\u03b3)] for a\npositive function g(\u03b2) with g(\u03b2) \u2192 \u221e as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. While\nmi mj are not, strictly speaking, independent, it is natural to\nassume that their dependence is weak, i.e. their correlation\ndecays fast with the distance of the corresponding bonds (ij).\nThe behavior of the moment generating function of their sum\nis then qualitatively the same, with a renormalized rate function g(\u03b2), still diverging as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. As before, this is enough\nto carry out the Peierls-Griffiths estimate which implies spontaneous magnetization in the x-direction. We remark that our\nassumption about the fast decay of correlations implies that\nthe sums of mi mj over subsets of Z2 satisfy a large deviation\nprinciple analogous to that for sums of independent random\nvariables and the above argument can be restated using this\nfact.\nE. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations\n\nBased on the above discussion it is expected that the RFIO\neffect predicted here will lead to the appearance of magnetization, m, in the x direction of order 1 at low temperatures\nin systems much larger than the correlation length of typical excitations. For small systems, however, the effect may\nbe obscured by finite size effects, which, due to long-range\n\nm (magn. along x)\n\n4\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0.75\n0.7\n0.65\n0.6\n0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75\ny\n\n\u2206h =0\n\u2206hy=0.25\n\u2206hy=0.5\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nkBT/J\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFigure 2: (color online) Results of the Monte-Carlo simulation for\nthe classical 2D-XY model in a 200\u00d7200 lattice. The Inset is a magnetification of the main figure close to T = 0.7J/kB .\n\npower law decay of correlations, are particularly strong in the\nXY model in 2D. In particular, the 2D-XY model shows finite magnetization (m) in small systems36 , so that RFIO is\nexpected to result in an increase of the magnetization.\nWe have performed numerical Monte-Carlo simulations37\nfor the 2D-XY classical model [Hamiltonian (1), with \u01eb = 1].\nWe generate a random magnetic field, hi = \u03b7i ey in the y direction. The \u03b7i 's are independent\n\u221arandom real numbers, uni\u221a\nformly distributed in [\u2212 3\u2206hy , 3\u2206hy ]. Note that \u2206hy is\nthus the standard deviation of the random field hi . Boundary conditions on the outer square correspond to \u03c3i = (1, 0)\n[see Fig. 1]. The calculations were performed in 2D lattices\nwith up to 200\u00d7200 lattice sites for various temperatures. The\nresults are presented in Fig. 2.\nAt very small temperature, the system magnetizes in the absence of disorder (m approaches 1 when T tends to 0) due to\nthe finite size of the lattice36 . In this regime, a random field\nin the y direction tends to induce a small local magnetization,\nparallel to hi , so that the magnetization in the x direction, m,\nis slightly reduced. At higher temperatures (T \u2243 0.7J/kB in\nFig. 2), the magnetization is significantly smaller than 1 in the\nabsence of disorder. This is due to non-negligible spin wave\nexcitations. In the presence of small disorder, these excitations are suppressed due to the RFIO effect discussed in this\npaper. We indeed find that, at T = 0.7J/kB , m increases by\n1.6% in presence of the uniaxial disordered magnetic field. At\nlarger temperatures, excitations, such as Bloch walls or vortices are important and no increase of the magnetization is\nfound when applying a small random field in the y direction.\n\nIII. RFIO IN OTHER SYSTEMS\n\nThe RFIO effect predicted above may be generalized to\nother spin models, in particular those that have finite correlation length. Here we list the most spectacular generalizations:\n\nA. 2D Heisenberg ferromagnet (HF) in random fields of\nvarious symmetries\n\nHere the interaction has the same form as in the XY case,\nbut spins take values on a unit sphere. As for the XY Hamil-\n\n\f5\ntonian, if the random field distribution has the same symmetry\nas the interaction part, i.e. if it is symmetric under rotations in\nthree dimensions, the model has no spontaneous magnetization up to 4D (see Ref. 24,25). If the random field is uniaxial,\ne.g. oriented along the z axis, the system still has a continuous symmetry (rotations in the xy plane), and thus cannot\nhave spontaneous magnetization in this plane. It cannot magnetize in the z direction either, by the results of Ref. 25. Curiously enough, a field distribution with an intermediate symmetry may lead to symmetry breaking. Namely, arguments\nfully analogous to the previous ones imply that if the random\nfield takes values in the yz plane with a distribution invariant\nunder rotations, the system will magnetize in the x direction.\nWe are thus faced with the possibility that a planar field distribution breaks the symmetry, while this is broken neither by\na field with a spherically symmetric distribution nor by a uniaxial one.\n\nB. 3D XY and Heisenberg models in a random field of various\nsymmetries\n\nWe have argued that the 2D XY model with a small uniaxial random field orders at low T . Since in the absence of\nthe random field spontaneous magnetization occurs only at\nT = 0, this can be equivalently stated by saying that a small\nuniaxial random field raises the critical temperature Tc of the\nsystem. By analogy, one can expect that the (nonzero) Tc of\nthe XY model in 3D becomes higher and comparable to that\nof the 3D Ising model, in the presence of a small uniaxial field.\nA simple meanfield estimate suggests that Tc might increase\nby a factor of 2. The analogous estimates for the Heisenberg\nmodel in 3D suggest an increase of Tc by a factor 3/2 (or 3)\nin a small uniaxial (or planar rotationally symmetric) field respectively. These conjectures are the subject of a forthcoming\nproject.\n\nThe Mermin-Wagner theorem27 implies that the model has no\nspontaneous magnetization at positive temperatures in 2D. For\nD > 2 spin wave analysis39\u201341 shows the existence of spontaneous magnetization (though a rigorous mathematical proof\nof this fact is still lacking). In general, one does not expect\nmajor differences between the behaviors of the two models at\nT 6= 0. It thus seems plausible that the presence of a random field in the quantum case is going to have effects similar to those in the classical Heisenberg model. Similarly, one\ncan consider the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF)\nand expect phenomena analogous to the classical case, despite\nthe fact that unlike their classical counterparts, the quantum\nHF and HAF systems are no longer equivalent. We expect\nto observe spontaneous staggered magnetization in a random\nuniaxial XY model, or random planar field HF. A possibility\nthat a random field in the z-direction can enhance the antiferromagnetic order in the xy plane has been pointed out in\nRef. 42.\nIV.\n\nTOWARDS THE EXPERIMENTAL REALIZATION OF\nRFIO IN ULTRACOLD ATOMIC SYSTEMS\n\nFurther understanding of the phenomena described in this\npaper will benefit from experimental realizations and investigations of the above-mentioned models. Below, we discuss the possibilities to design quantum simulators for these\nquantum spin systems using ultracold atoms in optical lattices\n(OL).\nA. Two-component lattice Bose gas\n\nConsider a two-component Bose gas confined in an OL\nwith on-site inhomogeneities. The two components correspond here to two internal states of the same atom. The\nlow-T physics is captured by the Bose-Bose Hubbard model\n(BBH)43 (for a review of ultracold lattice gases see Ref. 44):\n\nC. Antiferromagnetic systems\n\nHBBH =\nBy flipping every second spin, the classical ferromagnetic\nmodels are equivalent to antiferromagnetic ones (on bipartite\nlattices). This equivalence persists in the presence of a random field with a distribution symmetric with respect to the\norigin. Thus the above discussion of the impact of random\nfields on continuous symmetry breaking in classical ferromagnetic models translates case by case to the antiferromagnetic\ncase.\n\nD. Quantum systems\n\nAll of the effects predicted above should, in principle have\nquantum analogs. Quantum fluctuations might, however, destroy the long-range order, so each of the discussed models should be carefully reconsidered in the quantum case.\nSome models, such as the quantum spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg\nmodel, for instance, have been widely studied in literature38 .\n\nX h Ub\n2\n\nj\n\nnj (nj \u2212 1) +\n\nUB\nNj (Nj \u2212 1)\n2\n\ni X\n(vj nj + Vj Nj )\n+UbB nj Nj +\n\n(4)\n\nj\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0011\ni\nX h\u0010\nJb b\u2020j bl + JB B\u2020j Bl + h.c.\n\nhj,li\n\n\u2212\n\nX \u0012 \u03a9j\nj\n\n2\n\n\u0013\nb\u2020j Bj + h.c.\n\nwhere bj and Bj are the annihilation operators for both types\nof Bosons in the lattice site j, nj = b\u2020j bj and Nj = B\u2020j Bj are\nthe corresponding number operators, and hj, li denote a pair of\nadjacent sites in the OL.

Possibly, both on-site energies vj , Vj and\nthe Raman complex amplitude \u03a9j can be made site-dependent\nusing speckle laser light13\u201315 .\nConsider the limit of strong repulsive interactions (0 <\nJb , JB , |\u03a9j | \u226a Ub , UB , UBb ) and a total filling factor of 1\n(i.e. the total number of particles equals the number of lattice sites). Proceeding as in the case of Fermi-Bose mixtures,\nrecently analyzed by two of the authors in Ref. 23, we derive\nan effective Hamiltonian, Heff , for the Bose-Bose mixture. In\nbrief,Qwe restrict the Hilbert space to a subspace E0 generated\nby { j |nj , Nj i} with nj +Nj = 1 at each lattice site, and we\nincorporate the tunneling terms via second-order perturbation\ntheory as in Ref. 23.

Hamiltonian Heff\ndescribes the dynamics of composite particles whose annihilation operator at site j is Bj = b\u2020j Bj P. In contrast to the case\nof Fermi-Bose mixtures discussed in Ref. 23, where the composites are fermions, in the present case of Bose-Bose mixtures, they are composite Schwinger Bosons made of one B\nboson and one b hole.\nSince the commutation relations of Bj and Bj\u2020 are those\nof Schwinger Bosons45 , we can directly turn to the spin\nrepresentation45 by defining Sxj + iSyj = Bj and Szj =\n1/2 \u2212 Nj , where Nj = Bj\u2020 Bj . It is important to note\nthat since Raman processes\nP can convert b Bosons into B\nBosons (and conversely), j hNj i is not fixed by the total\nnumber\nP of Bosons of each species, i.e. the z component of\nm, j hSzj i is not constrained. For small inhomogeneities\n(\u03b4j,l = vj \u2212 vl , \u2206j,l = Vj \u2212 Vl \u226a Ub , Ub , UbB ), Hamiltonian\nHeff is then equivalent to the anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ\nmodel45 in a random field:\nX\nX\n\u0001\nSzj Szl\nSxj Sxl + Syj Syl \u2212 Jz\nHeff = \u2212J\u22a5\n\nVj Nj \u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0011 X\nKj,l Nj Nl\n+ h.c +\nhj,li\n\nX \u0012 \u03a9j\nj\n\n2\n\n\u0013\nBj + h.c.\n\n(7)\n\n2\n4JB\n/UB \uf8fa\n\u00112 \uf8fb , (8)\n\u0010\n\u2206j,l\n1 \u2212 UB\n\nhj,li\n\nX\u0010\n\n(6)\n\nX\n\nhxj Sxj\n\nhj,li\n\n+\n\nhyj Syj\n\n+\n\nhzj Szj\n\nj\n\n\u0001\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n(5)\n\nwhere Bj = b\u2020j Bj P, P is the projector onto E0 and Nj =\nBj\u2020 Bj .

In\natomic systems, all these (possibly site-dependent) terms can\nbe controlled almost at will23,44,46 . In particular, by employing\nvarious possible control tools one can reach the HF (J\u22a5 = Jz )\nand XY (Jz = 0) cases.\n\nB. Bose lattice gas embedded in a BEC\n\nThe quantum ferromagnetic XY model in a random field\nmay be alternatively obtained using the same BBH model, but\nwith strong state dependence of the optical dipole forces. One\ncan imagine a situation in which one-component (say b) is in\nthe strong interaction limit, so that only one b atom at a site is\npossible, whereas the other (B) component is in the Bose condensed state and provides only a coherent BEC 'background'\nfor the b-atoms. Mathematically speaking, this situation is described by Eq. (4), in which ni 's can be equal to 0 or 1 only,\nwhereas Bi 's can be replaced by a classical complex field\n(condensate wave function). In this limit the spin S = 1/2\nstates can be associated with the presence, or absence of a batom in a given site. In this way, setting vj = 0 and \u03a9Ij = 0,\none obtains the quantum version of the XY model (1) with\nJ = Jb and a uniaxial random field in the x direction with the\nstrength determined by \u03a9R\nj .\nC.\n\nTwo-component Fermi lattice gas\n\nFinally, the S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model\nmay be realized with a Fermi-Fermi mixture at half filling\nfor each component. This implementation might be of special importance for future experiments with Lithium atoms.\nAs recently calculated47 , the critical temperature for the N\u00e9el\nstate in a 3D cubic lattice is of the order of 30nK. It is well\nknown that in a 3D cubic lattice the critical temperatures for\nthe antiferromagnetic Heisenberg, the XY and the Ising models are Tc,XY \u2243 1.5Tc,Heis , and Tc,Ising \u2243 2Tc,Heis . The\nestimates of these critical temperatures can be, for instance,\nobtained applying the Curie-Weiss mean field method to the\nclassical models. Suppose that we put the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a uniaxial (respectively, planar) random field,\ncreated using the same methods as discussed above, i.e. we\nbreak the SU (2) symmetry and put the system into the universality class of XY (respectively, Ising) models. Mean field\nestimates suggest then that we should expect the increase of\nthe critical temperature by factor 1.5 (respectively, 2), that is\nup to \u2243 45 (respectively, 90)nK. Even if these estimates are\ntoo optimistic, and the effect is two, three times smaller, one\nshould stress, that even an increase by, say 10nK, is of great\nexperimental relevance and could be decisive for achieving of\nantiferromagnetic state.\nWe would like to stress that similar proposals, as the three\ndiscussed above, have been formulated before48, but none of\nthem treat simultaneously essential aspects for the present\nschemes: i) disordered fields, but not bonds; ii) arbitrary directions of the fields; iii) possibility of exploring Ising, XY\n\nor Heisenberg symmetries; iv) realizing the coherent source\nof atoms; and v) avoiding constraints on the magnetization\nalong the z axis.\nIt is also worth commenting on what are the most important experimental challenges that have to be addressed in order to achieve RFIO. Evidently, for the proposals involving\nthe strong interaction limit of two-component Bose, or Fermi\nsystems, the main issue is the temperature which has to be of\norder of tens of nano-Kelvins. Such temperatures are starting to be achievable nowadays (for a carefull discussion in the\ncontext of Fermi-Bose mixtures see Ref. 49), and there exist\nseveral proposals for supplementary cooling of lattice gases,\nusing laser (photons) or couplings to ultracold BEC (phonon\ncooling) that can help (for reviews see Ref. 44,46.\n\nV. SUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we have proposed a general mechanism\nof random-field-induced order (RFIO), occurring in systems\nwith continuous symmetry, placed in a random field that\nbreaks, or reduces this symmetry. We have presented rigorous results for the case of the 2D-classical ferromagnetic XY\nmodel in a random uniaxial field, and proved that the system\nhas spontaneous magnetization at temperature T = 0. We\nhave presented also a rather strong evidence that this is also\nthe case for small T > 0. Several generalizations of this\nmechanism to various classical and quantum systems were\ndiscussed. We have presented also detailed proposals to realize RFIO in experiments using two-component Bose lattice\ngases, one-component Bose lattice gases embedded in BECs,\nor two-component Fermi lattice gases. Our results shed light\non controversies in existing literature, and open the way to\nrealize RFIO with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.\nIt is worth mentioning two further realizations of RFIO\nstudied by us recently. RFIO occurs in a two-component\ntrapped Bose gas at T = 0, when the gas is condensed and\nthe two components are coupled by Raman transition of random strength, but fixed phase. Although such a system belongs to the universality class of the (trapped, i.e. located in\nan inhomogenous field) XY model, it exhibits the RFIO effect in a much stronger manner than the XY model discussed\nin the present paper. We have found this observation important\nenough to devote a separate detailed paper to it50 . Similarly,\nwe have studied numerically RFIO in 1D for quantum XY\nand Heisenberg chains51 . In such systems, even at T = 0,\nmagnetization vanishes, but amazingly enough the RFIO effect seems to work at the level of the magnetic susceptibilities.\nAdding a random field confined to a certain axis (respectively,\nplane), increases siginificantly the magnetic suceptibility in\nthe perpedicular directions (respectively, direction).\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank I.
