Thus Gott et al. (2001) study a collection of all\navailable pre-mid-1999 estimates of the present value of Hubble's constant, H0 , and derive\nH0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 = 67 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nat two standard deviations1 , a significantly more constraining estimate of H0 than is provided by\nany single measurement.\nSimilar meta-analysis techniques have been used to determine binned multipole-space cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra by combining many different CMB\nanisotropy measurements (see, e.g., Podariu et al. 2001; Miller et al. 2002; Page 2002; Wang et\n1\n\nWhere the first equation defines the dimensionless parameter h and we halve the 2 \u03c3 error bar of Gott et al. (2001)\nto get a 1 \u03c3 error bar for our computations.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nal. 2002; Mukherjee & Wang 2003), and to derive constraints on cosmological-model-parameters\nfrom combined CMB anisotropy data sets (see, e.g., \u00d6dman et al. 2002; Mukherjee et al. 2002;\nDouspis et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2002).\nThe more widely used weighted mean technique, discussed in Podariu et al. (2001), assumes\nGaussian errors.2 Thus in this case one may compute a goodness-of-fit parameter, and the number\nof standard deviations, N\u03c3 , this parameter deviates from what is expected (Podariu et al. 2001).\nA large value of N\u03c3 could indicate the presence of unaccounted for systematic uncertainties, the\nbreakdown of the Gaussian assumption, or the presence of significant correlations between the\nindividual measurements used.\nThe other technique we use, that based on median statistics (Gott et al. 2001)3 , does not\nassume that the measurement errors are Gaussian, or even that the magnitude of these errors are\nknown. It assumes only that the measurements are independent and free of systematic errors. It\nis hence not possible to estimate the goodness of fit in the median statistics case. However, since\nthe median statistics technique is based on fewer assumptions than the weighted mean technique,\nmedian statistics results are more robust, but still - as Gott et al. (2001) show - almost as\nconstraining as weighted mean results.\nIn this paper we apply both these techniques to collections of estimates of \u03a9M0 , the present\nvalue of the mean mass density of non-relativistic matter in the universe. A robust and tight\nestimate of \u03a9M0 is of great interest. Current indications are that \u03a9M0 is small and we live in a\nlow-density universe (see Peebles & Ratra 2003 for a review). This, in conjunction with recent\nCMB anisotropy measurements which suggest that the curvature of spatial hypersurfaces is small,\nindicates that a dark energy dominated spatially-flat universe (see, e.g., Peebles 1984; Peebles &\nRatra 1988, 2003; Steinhardt 1999; Sahni & Starobinsky 2000; Carroll 2001; Padmanabhan 2002)\nis observationally favored over a spatially open model with insignificant dark energy density (see,\ne.g., Gott 1982; Ratra & Peebles 1995). To strengthen this conclusion it would be helpful to have\nin hand a more robust and tight estimate of \u03a9M0 than is available from any single measurement.4\n2\n\nA number of quantities of interest, e.g., the CMB anisotropy spectrum, are commonly thought to have been\ngenerated by quantum fluctuations in a weakly coupled field during an early epoch of inflation and are thus realizations of spatially stationary Gaussian random processes (see, e.g., Ratra 1985; Fischler, Ratra, & Susskind 1985).\nMeasurements appear to be consistent with this Gaussianity assumption - for discussions of the Gaussianity of the\nsmaller-scale CMB anisotropy see, e.g., Park et al. (2001), Shandarin et al. (2002), Santos et al. (2002), and Polenta\net al. (2002) - and so in cases where the experimental noise is Gaussian it is fair to use the weighted mean technique.\n3\n4\n\nSee Avelino, Martins, & Pinto (2002) for a recent application of the Gott et al. (2001) median statistics technique.\n\nOf course, comparing the predictions of dark energy dominated models to observational measurements is another\nway to check for the presence of dark energy. In the near future neoclassical cosmological tests that hold significant\npromise include those based on CMB anisotropy (see, e.g., Brax, Martin, & Riazuelo 2000; Amendola et al. 2002),\ngravitational lensing (see, e.g., Ratra & Quillen 1992; Waga & Frieman 2000; Chae et al. 2002), Type Ia supernova\nredshift-apparent magnitude (see, e.g., Podariu & Ratra 2000; Waga & Frieman 2000; Leibundgut 2001), redshiftcounts (see, e.g., Huterer & Turner 2001; Podariu & Ratra 2001; Levine, Schulz, & White 2002), and redshift-angular\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWhile it would be useful to focus on measurements of \u03a9M0 that are independent of cosmological\nmodel, we have been able to locate only 30 such recent smaller-scale estimates of \u03a9M0 . To reduce\nstatistical uncertainty it is desirable to have a greater number of \u03a9M0 estimates. We hence also\nconsider recent \u03a9M0 estimates derived assuming either a spatially-flat model with a cosmological\nconstant \u039b or an open model with no \u039b.\nThe \u03a9M0 measurements we focus on are listed and discussed in \u00a7 2. Results are presented and\ndiscussed in \u00a7 3. We conclude in \u00a7 4.\n\n2.\n\n\u03a9M0 Measurements\n\nTables 1-3 list the values and errors bars of \u03a9M0 for the measurements we consider. Table 1\nlists values determined in a manner that is independent of cosmological model, while Tables 2 and\n3 list values derived assuming a spatially flat \u039b dominated model, and a spatially open model with\nno \u039b, respectively. In general, in these Tables, we include quoted systematic errors in quadrature\nwhen determining the total error bar and assume a Gaussian distribution when determining 1 \u03c3\nerrors (if these are not given). In what follows we briefly describe how we determine the \u03a9M0 values\nand error bars given in these Tables.\n\n2.1.\n\nRedshift Distortion Factor\n\n0.6\nThere are many measurements of the redshift distortion factor \u03b2 = \u03a90.6\nM0 /b, where \u03a9M0 is a\nreasonably accurate approximation of the velocity function evaluated at zero redshift f (z = 0)\n(Peebles 1993, \u00a7 13) and b is the bias factor for the tracer used, defined in terms of the ratio of\nthe fractional density perturbations, b = \u03b4trace /\u03b4mass , where \u03b4trace is the fractional number density\nperturbation.\n\nTo determine \u03a9M0 from \u03b2 we need to know the bias factor. In this paper, we use, for optical\ngalaxies (Verde et al. 2002; Lahav et al. 2002; Peacock et al. 2002)5\nbO = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1,\n\n(2)\n\nand for infrared galaxies and clusters of galaxies (Plionis et al. 2000),\nbI = bO /(1.21 \u00b1 0.06),\n\nbC = bI (4.3 \u00b1 0.8),\n\nall at one standard deviation.\nsize (see, e.g., Zhu & Fujimoto 2002; Chen & Ratra 2003; Podariu et al. 2003) data.\n5\n\nWe average the values given in these papers to get the bO value quoted here.\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nTypically, \u03b2 is measured from density-density comparisons (D-D in the Tables) or velocityvelocity comparisons (V-V in the Tables), or through the distortion effect of peculiar velocities on\nredshift surveys. By using the somewhat related least-action principle, Susperregi (2001) is able to\nindependently determine \u03a9M0 and b, and we quote his value of \u03a9M0 in Table 1.\n\n2.2.\n\nPower Spectrum\n\nA commonly used simple analytic fit to the observed power spectrum of cosmological mass\nfluctuations is the CDM spectrum (see, e.g., Peacock 1999, \u00a7 16.8). In this approximation, the\nshape and amplitude of the mass power spectrum depends on two parameters: the shape parameter\n\u0393, and \u03c38 , the rms fractional mass density variation averaged over 8h\u22121 Mpc spheres. Nowadays,\nthe shape parameter is usually approximated by (Sugiyama 1995),\n\u0393 = \u03a9M0 he\u2212\u03a9B (1+\n\n\u221a\n\n2h/\u03a9M0 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a9B is a measure of the present mean mass density in baryonic matter. Occasionally however\nthe shape parameter is still defined through \u0393 = \u03a9M0 h.\nTo extract a value and error bars for \u03a9M0 from a measurement of \u0393 we need the value of h -\nwe use eq. (1) for this - and an estimate of the baryonic mass density parameter \u03a9B , for which\nwe use\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.014 \u00b1 0.004,\n(5)\nat 1 \u03c3, derived by averaging the two extreme values quoted in \u00a7 IV.B.2 of Peebles & Ratra (2003).\n\n2.3.\n\nVelocity Correlation\n\nBy assuming a shape for the power spectrum, the velocity correlation method provides a\nconstraint on a function of \u03c38 and \u03a90.6\nM0 by comparing the observed velocity correlation to that\npredicted from the power spectrum. Given an estimate of \u03c38 , for which we use6\n\u03c38 = 0.94 \u00b1 0.11,\n\n(6)\n\nat 1 \u03c3, we can determine \u03a9M0 . Juszkiewicz et al. (2000) consider a variant of this method based\non relative velocities of galaxies.\n6\n\nHere the rms factional mass density variation averaged over 8h\u22121 Mpc spheres \u03c38 = \u03c38trace /btrace , where \u03c38trace\nis the corresponding rms number density variation and btrace is the bias factor for the tracer used. We average the\nvalues given for \u03c38 in eq. (37) of Hamilton & Tegmark (2002) and eq. (12) of Szalay et al. (2001).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.4.\n\nGas Mass Fraction\n\nAssuming the baryonic mass fraction in galaxy clusters is an accurate representation of that\nof the universe, and given \u03a9B , the baryon mass fraction fb provides an estimate of \u03a9M0 ,\n\u03a9M0 = \u03a9B /fb .\n\n(7)\n\nThe related gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters, fg , is what is measured, and it provides the\nestimate\n\u03a9B\n\u03a9M0 =\n,\n(8)\nfg (1 + 0.19h0.5 )\nwhere we use h and \u03a9B from eqs. (1) and (5).\n\n2.5.\n\nMass to Light Ratios\n\nThis method assumes that the mass-to-light ratios of galaxy clusters are accurate representatives of that of the whole universe. Table 1 lists the Carlberg et al. (1997a) and Bahcall et al. (2000)\n\u03a9M0 values and 1 \u03c3 ranges. We also show results derived from the Hradecky et al. (2000) data;\nto determine the \u03a9M0 central value and 1 \u03c3 range, we compute the weighted mean and error bar\nof M/LV using Table 5 of their paper and use the Efstathiou, Ellis, & Peterson (1988) estimate\nhLi \u2248 (2 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 108 hL\u2299 Mpc\u22123 .\n\n2.6.\n\nCosmological-Model-Dependent Estimates\n\nTables 2 and 3 list \u03a9M0 values determined assuming a flat-\u039b and an open cosmological model,\nrespectively. Such model-dependent estimates are becoming more common. Weak lensing (WL)\nmeasurements have recently begun to provide interesting constraints on a function of \u03a9M0 and \u03c38 ,\nwhile improving galaxy cluster number density measurements (both at the present epoch and as\na function of redshift) constrain a related function. Using the estimate for \u03c38 given in eq. (6) we\nmay use these constraints as measurements of \u03a9M0 .\nTable 2 also lists estimates of \u03a9M0 from various other methods, including cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropy measurements, the angular size versus redshift (\u03b8 \u2212 z) test, strong\ngravitational lensing, and the supernova apparent magnitude versus redshift test.\n\n3.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nTable 1 lists 30 \"model-independent\" measurements of \u03a9M0 , while Tables 2 and 3 show 28\nand 14 results determined assuming a flat-\u039b and an open model, respectively. In addition to these\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthree data sets, we also consider two additional combination data sets: combinations of the 30\nmodel-independent results with the flat-\u039b model values and with the open model values.\nFor each of these five data sets, we compute the weighted mean of \u03a9M0 and the associated\nerror estimate as follows (see, e.g., Podariu et al. 2001). The standard expression for the weighted\nmean is\nPN\n2\ni=1 (\u03a9M0 )i /\u03c3i\n,\n(9)\n\u03a9M0 = P\nN\n2\ni=1 1/\u03c3i\n\nwhere i = 1, 2, . . . N indexes the N measurements in the data set, with central values (\u03a9M0 )i and\nerrors \u03c3i . The (internal) error estimate for each data set is\n\u03c3=\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n1/\u03c3i 2\n\n!\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe goodness of fit parameter is\nN\n\nN\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n1 X ((\u03a9M0 )i \u2212 \u03a9M0 )2 X 2\n\u03c7i ,\n=\n\u03c7 =\nN \u22121\n\u03c3i 2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the last equation defines \u03c72i , the \"reduced \u03c72 \" contribution from each measurement. Since\nthe weighted mean technique assumes Gaussian errors, \u03c7 has expected value unity with error\np\n1/ 2(N \u2212 1), so the number of standard deviations that \u03c7 deviates from unity is\np\nN\u03c3 = |\u03c7 \u2212 1| 2(N \u2212 1).\n(12)\nA large value of N\u03c3 could indicate the presence of unaccounted for systematic errors, the invalidity\nof the Gaussian assumption, or the presence of significant correlations between the measurements.\n\nWe also analyze each of the five data sets using median statistics (see, e.g., Gott et al. 2001;\nPodariu et al. 2001). For each data set, we construct the distribution for the true median \u03a9M0\nvalue using the binomial theorem method of eq. (1) of Gott et al. (2001).7 Since \u03a9M0 is positive,\nfollowing Gott et al. (2001), we integrate over this distribution with a logarithmic prior between\ndata points to determine confidence intervals for \u03a9M0 .8\nTable 4 shows the results for the weighted mean and median statistics analyses. The upper half\nof the table shows results derived using all measurements. The weighted mean technique results in\ntighter constraints on \u03a9M0 , while the median statistics constraints are weaker. This result (Gott\n7\n\nFor example, if there were two measurements of a given quantity, x1 and x2 (x1 < x2 ), then there is a 25\n% probability that the true median lies below x1 , a 50 % probability that it lies between x1 and x2 , and a 25 %\nprobability that it lies above x2 .\n8\n\nLower and upper confidence levels at 1 and 2 \u03c3 significance are determined such that the probabilities inside the\n1 and 2 \u03c3 ranges are divided in half by the median value.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\net al. 2001; Podariu et al. 2001) is reinforced by the large N\u03c3 values in the upper half of Table 4.\nFor Gaussian distributed errors, N\u03c3 is a measure of how well the weighted mean and derived error\nbar represent the measurements considered. N\u03c3 is greater than 2 in all cases, i.e., \u03c7 is more than\n2 \u03c3 away from what is expected for Gaussian distributed errors. This most likely means that one\n(or more) of the measurements has an underestimated error bar.9 Since median statistics do not\nmake use of the measurement error bars, the median statistics results are likely more reliable than\nthe weighted mean results.\nTo examine the issue of large N\u03c3 values, we proceed as follows. For each measurement in each of\nthe five data sets, we compute \u03c72i , eq. (11). We then discard the \u223c 5 % most discrepant (largest \u03c72i )\nmeasurements from each data set and so generate five culled data sets of \"good\" measurements.\nFor the model-independent data set, we drop only one measurement, that from the least-action\nprinciple method (Susperregi 2001), which has a small error bar and \u03c72i = 0.99. For the flat-\u039b data\nset we have to drop two measurements: the Zaroubi et al. (1997) v-correlation result which has a\nlarge \u03a9M0 and \u03c72i = 0.29, and the Allen et al. (2002b) cluster number density measurement which\nhas a small \u03a9M0 and \u03c72i = 0.27. For the open model data set we drop the Hamana et al. (2002)\nweak lensing measurement which has a small \u03a9M0 and \u03c72i = 1.3. These measurements are also the\nmost discrepant ones in the two combination data sets, so we drop them again when generating\nthe culled combination data sets. Of course, not all large N\u03c3 values are reduced to unity by this\nculling (although they can be by further culling): we are only discarding the most \"discrepant\"\nmeasurements to investigate the stability (robustness) of the constraints on \u03a9M0 .\nResults from the analyses of the culled data sets are shown in the lower half of Table 4. For\nthe model-independent, flat-\u039b, and their combination data sets, the weighted mean and median\nstatistics error bars are in better accord, and N\u03c3 are of order unity. For the open model data sets\nN\u03c3 are smaller now, but still significantly large than unity, indicating perhaps that the error bars\non one or more of the remaining measurements are underestimated.\nFocussing on the median statistics 2 \u03c3 ranges for the culled data sets (the lower half of the\nlast column of Table 4), if we exclude the open model results for the reason mentioned above, a\nreasonable summary is\n0.2 . \u03a9M0 . 0.35\n(13)\nat two standard deviations, with central value at \u03a9M0 \u223c 0.25 \u2212 0.3. It is reassuring that these\nsummary values are in agreement with other recent estimates (see, e.g., Peebles & Ratra 2003).\n9\n\nGiven the available evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the Gaussianity assumption is not invalid. In\naddition, we have attempted to select only those measurements that are not strongly correlated. Thus the large N\u03c3\nvalues we find are most likely a consequence of one (or more) measurements that have underestimated error bars.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have determined a preliminary estimate of the mean mass density in nonrelativistic matter,\nfrom median statistics analyses of various collections of measurements. The results of our metaanalysis estimate of \u03a9M0 appear very reasonable. More high quality data, especially \"modelindependent\" data, should allow for significantly more constraining limits on \u03a9M0 .\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with R. Gott, J. Peebles, S.
