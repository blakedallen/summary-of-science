We provide a fifth\norder proof.\n\n1\n2\n\nweihe@nankai.edu.cn\nmiaoyg@nankai.edu.cn\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMathieu equation was first introduced by E. Mathieu when he studied vibrating elliptical\nmembranes[1]. Its canonical form is\nd2 u\n+ (\u03bb \u2212 2qcos2z)u = 0.\ndz 2\n\n(1)\n\nThe related modified Mathieu equation is obtained by z \u2192 iz:\nd2 u\n\u2212 (\u03bb \u2212 2qcosh2z)u = 0.\ndz 2\n\n(2)\n\nThe Mathieu equation is useful in various mathematics and physics problems. As an example,\nthe separation of variables for the wave equation in the elliptical coordinates leads to the\nMathieu equation.\nAccording to the Floquet theory, the solution of the Mathieu equation can be written in\nthe form:\nu\u03bd (z) = ei\u03bdz f (z).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere f (z) is a function of period \u03c0, and in general \u03bd is a constant independent of z. \u03bd\nis called the Floquet characteristic exponent, it is a function of the constants \u03bb and q. A\nclassical result is that the Floquet exponent can be obtained through the Hill's determinant.\nMoreover, if \u03bd is an even integer, then the solution u(z) is a periodic function of period \u03c0;\nif \u03bd is an odd integer, then the solution u(z) is a periodic function of period 2\u03c0. In our\ndiscussion in this paper, u(z) is not required to be periodic.\nThe Mathieu equation has been studied for a long time, for the collections of classical\nresults see nice references [2, 3, 4, 5], and more recent studies in [6, 7].\nAnother object we study here is a particular elliptic curve. Geometrically the elliptic\ncurve is topologically equivalent to a torus, it is a Riemann surface of genus g = 1. The\nrelation between the Mathieu equation and the elliptic curve naturally aries in the integrable\ntheory. The (modified) Mathieu equation is the Shr\u00f6dinger equation of the two body Toda\nsystem, while the elliptic curve is just the spectral curve of the classical Toda system. See\n[8] for relevant backgrounds. As an illustration, let us start from the Mathieu operator\nL = d2z + \u03bb \u2212 2qcos2z\n= d2z + \u03bb \u2212 q(ei2z +\n\n1\nei2z\n\n).\n\n(4)\n\nSubstituting dz = x and q(e2iz \u2212 e\u22122iz ) = y, where x, y are complex coordinates. Then we\nhave\n\nL = (x2 + \u03bb) \u00b1\n1\n\np\ny 2 + 4q 2 .\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe relation\ny 2 = (x2 + \u03bb)2 \u2212 4q 2\n\n(6)\n\nis nothing else but the elliptic curve we are interested in.\nThe curve (6) has two independent conjugate cycles \u03b1 and \u03b2, they are canonical basis of\nthe homology class of the torus. According to the general theory of Riemann surfaces, there\nis a holomorphic differential one form on the torus:\n\u03c9=\n\ndx\n,\ny\n\n(7)\n\nand we can construct two periods by integrating \u03c9 along cycles \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n \u0328\n \u0328\nA = \u03c9,\nB = \u03c9.\n\u03b1\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b2\n\nThen \u03c4 = B\n, Im\u03c4 > 0 is the complex modulus of the elliptic curve.\nA\nHowever, we are interested in a meromorphic one form,\n\u03c9\u0303 =\n\nx2 dx\n.\ny\n\n(9)\n\n\u2202 x\n( y )dx, the total derivative term will not contribute to\nIt is related to \u03c9 by \u03c9 = \u22122 \u2202\u2202\u03bb\u03c9\u0303 + \u2202x\ncontour integrals. The reason for us to study \u03c9\u0303, rather than \u03c9, is that it is directly related\n\nto the Mathieu equation. As a first hint, let x2 + \u03bb = 2qcos2z, then we have\np\n\u03c9\u0303 = \u03bb \u2212 2qcos2zdz.\n\n(10)\n\nThis is actually the leading WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) solution of the Mathieu equation. In the next section, we will see that they have an even deeper connection. In physics\nliterature, the elliptic curve (6) is called Seiberg-Witten curve, and \u03c9\u0303 is the Seiberg-Witten\ndifferential[9]3 .\nThe elliptic curve (6) can be viewed as a double covering of the branched x-plane. There\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nare four branch points at x = (i \u03bb + 2q, i \u03bb \u2212 2q, \u2212i \u03bb \u2212 2q, \u2212i \u03bb + 2q), and two branch\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncuts run between (i \u03bb + 2q, i \u03bb \u2212 2q) and (\u2212i \u03bb \u2212 2q, \u2212i \u03bb + 2q). The homology cycle \u03b1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nof the elliptic curve corresponds to the contour encircling singularities (i \u03bb + 2q, i \u03bb \u2212 2q),\nand the homology cycle \u03b2 of the elliptic curve corresponds to the contour encircling singu\u221a\n\u221a\nlarities (i \u03bb \u2212 2q, \u2212i \u03bb \u2212 2q). In the next two sections we will show that, for q << 1 the\nQ3\nIn some literatures, as in [9], the elliptic curve is presented in a cubic form y 2 = i=1 (x \u2212 ei ); while in\nQ\n4\nsome other literatures, as here, the elliptic curve is presented in a quartic form y 2 = i=1 (x \u2212 \u1ebdi ). They are\nequivalent forms of the same curve. The cubic form is obtained from the quartic one by proper coordinates\ntransformations and parameter redefinitions, the result is that one of the zeros \u1ebdi is mapped to infinite. The\n2\n2\nq2\ncubic curve in [9] can be written as y 2 = (x2 \u2212 16\n)(x \u2212 \u03bb8 ), after identifying u = ~8 \u03bb, \u039b2 = ~4 q according to\n[11] and rescaling x \u2192 ~2 x, y \u2192 ~3 y.\n3\n\n2\n\n\fFloquet exponent \u03bd is given by integrals of differential one forms along the \u03b1 cycle on the\ntorus, for q >> 1 the \u03bd is given by integrals of the same differential forms along the \u03b2 cycle.\nThe relation between Mathieu equation and elliptic curve we present here is found in\nour study in[10, 11], about a relation between gauge theories and quantization of integrable\nsystems[12]. It suggests us to develop a WKB formalism to solve the Mathieu equation, as\nwe explain in the next section. In this paper we try to present the problem as a differential\nequation problem, for relevant physics background, see [12] and [11, 13], and references\ntherein.\n\n2\n\nFloquet characteristic exponents from elliptic curve\n\nAs the first step, we rewrite the Mathieu equation in a form convenient for WKB expansion.\nSuppose q >> 1, we rewrite it as\n\u01eb2 d2 u\n+ (w \u2212 cos2z)u = 0,\n2 dz 2\nwhere \u01eb2 = 1q , w =\n\n\u03bb\n.\n2q\n\n(11)\n\nThen \u01eb is a small expansion parameter. We expand u(z) as WKB\n\nseries:\ni\n\nu(z) = e\n\n \u0301z\n\nz0\n\n\u2032\n\np(z )dz\n\n\u2032\n\ni\n\n=e\n\n \u0301z\n\nz0 (\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\np0 (z )\n+p1 (z )+\u01ebp2 (z )+*** )dz\n\u01eb\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nSubstituting the series expansion (12) into the equation (11) , we can solve p(z) order by\norder.\nOf course, the requirement q >> 1 is not always satisfied. One may wonder if the results\nwe get can be applied to the case q << 1. As we will see later, by suitably adjusting \u03bb,\nwe actually obtain two convergent series. One series is convergent for q >> 1, \u03bdq2 << 1,\nsurprisingly it is still valid for the region q << 1, \u03bd >> 1. Another series is convergent for\n2\n\nq >> 1, \u03bdq << 1.\nThe first few recursive relations for pm are:\np0 =\n\np\n\np2 = \u2212\n\ni\n\u2032\np1 = (ln p0 ) ,\n2\n\n2(w \u2212 cos2z),\n\n1\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n[2(ln p0 ) \u2212 ((ln p0 ) )2 ],\n8p0\n\n***\nwhere the prime denotes\n\ni p2 \u2032\np3 = ( ) ,\n2 p0\n(13)\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202z\n\nThen we extend the Mathieu equation and its periodic solution to the complex domain\nassociated with the elliptic curve. Then p(z)dz is a differential one form associated to the\nelliptic curve. Actually, the leading order p0 (z)dz is proportional to the \u03c9\u0303 we introduced\n3\n\n\fabove. We are interested in the integrals of p(z)dz along the conjugate homology cycles\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 on the elliptic curve, or equivalently, along the contours encircling (\u2212 \u03c02 , \u03c02 ) and\n(\u2212 12 cos\u22121 w, 12 cos\u22121 w) on the z-plane. It is the monodromy of the Mathieu function along\ncycles \u03b1 and \u03b2 on the torus.\nThe leading order integrals are related to the complete elliptic integrals of the first and\nsecond kind, the result is:\n \u0328\np\n2\n1 1\np0 (z)dz = \u03c0 2(w + 1)F (\u2212 , , 1;\n),\n2 2\nw+1\n \u0328\u03b1\n1 1\n1\u2212w\ni\u03c0\n(w \u2212 1)F ( , , 2;\n).\n(14)\np0 (z)dz =\n2\n2 2\n2\n\u03b2\nAs p1 , p3 are total derivatives, the contour integrals of them are all zero\n \u0328\np2m+1 (z)dz = 0,\nm = 0, 1,\n\n(15)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nand\n \u0328\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nsin2 2z \u2212 4wcos2z + 4\ndz\n(w \u2212 cos2z)5/2\n8 2 \u03b1,\u03b2\n \u0328\ncos2z\n1\ndz\n= \u2212 \u221a\n12 2 A,B (w \u2212 cos2z)3/2\n \u0328 p\n1\n2\n=\n(2wdw + dw )\n2(w \u2212 cos2z)dz,\n12\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\np2 dz =\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n \u0328\n\n(16)\n\nd\n. We have simplified the integral by discarding some total derivative terms,\nwhere dw = dw\nthis method was first used in [13]. In a similar way we find\n \u0328\n \u0328\n1 28 2 4\n8 3\n5 2\np4 dz = 5 ( w dw + wdw + dw )\np0 dz.\n(17)\n2 45\n3\n3\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nWe can proceed the same technique to obtain the differential operators for higher order\npm , by discarding total derivative terms and simplifying the expression as far as possible.\nWe call these differential operators generating differential operators. Acting these differential\n \u0327\noperators on p0 dz, we can get higher order contour integrals, they can be written as\ncombinations of the hypergeometric functions by using the formula:\nd\nab\nF (a, b, c; z) = F (a + 1, b + 1, c + 1; z).\n(18)\ndz\nc\n \u0327\n \u0327\nAs a demonstration, the expression for p2 dz can be found in [11], and p4 dz is even more\nlengthy. We can get series expansions near a suitable value of w from these hypergeometric\nfunctions. However, it is much simpler to get the series expansion of p0 first and then to act\nthe generating differential operators on this series.\n4\n\n\fIn principle, all higher order generating differential operators can be determined by WKB\nrelations. However it turns out that the calculations become very involved and it is hard to\ndetermine whether the expressions can be simplified further by discarding total derivative\nterms. Based on some observation on p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , we make a conjecture for higher order\ndifferential operators.\nClaim 1: In general we have\n \u0328\n\np2m+1 dz = 0,\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n \u0328\n\np2m dz =\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(cm,m w m d2m\nw\n\n+\n\ncm,m\u22121 w m\u22121 d2m\u22121\nw\n\n+***+\n\ncm,1 wdm+1\nw\n\n+\n\ncm,0 dm\nw)\n\n \u0328\n\np0 dz, (19)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere m = 0, 1, 2, * * * , and cm,i , (i = 0, 1, * * * , m) are numerical coefficients.\n\nNow we will state the relation between the monodromy of the Mathieu function along \u03b1, \u03b2\nand its Floquet exponent.

A crucial point is that although there are only three nonzero terms in (26),\nlimited by the accuracy of (24) to the q 6 order, the leading term w \u22125/2 is absent in (26), this\nfact enables us to determine the four coefficients in (28).

This is the classical result of\nthe Mathieu equation for q >> 1(See formula (20.2.30) in [5]). This finishes the proof of our\nClaim 3.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe show that the Mathieu equation is closely related to an elliptic curve, therefore there\nis a geometric structure for the Mathieu equation which is not captured by asymptotic\nanalysis. The Floquet exponent of the Mathieu equation can be derived from integrals of\ncertain differential forms along the homology cycles of the curve. These differential forms are\ndetermined by the WKB procedure. Integrals along each homology cycle give an asymptotic\nexpression for the Floquet exponent expanded at a specific point, the inverse series gives\nthe corresponding eigenvalue. Integrals along all homology cycles \u03b1 and \u03b2 give the complete\nasymptotic expansions (24) and (34) for the eigenvalue.\nThe appearance of Riemann surfaces associated with differential equations is quite familiar in the theory of integrable models, the Riemann surfaces are the spectral curves of\nthe classical integrable system while the differential equations are the Shr\u00f6dinger equation of\nthe same system. The (modified) Mathieu equation we discuss here is simply the two body\nToda system, the eigenvalue formulae (24) and (34) are states with large quantum numbers(expanded at \u03bb >> 1) and states with small quantum numbers(expanded at \u03bb \u223c 2q),\nrespectively[10, 11]. In fact, the Lax matrix L(z) of the classical two body periodic Toda\nsystem is[14]\n\u0013\n\u0012\np1\neq1 \u2212q2 + z \u22121 eq2 \u2212q1\n(35)\nL(z) =\neq1 \u2212q2 + zeq2 \u2212q1\np2\nwhere p1 , p2 are momentum and q1 , q2 are coordinates of the particles, z is the complex\nspectral parameter. The spectral curve is obtained by the determinant\ndet(\u03bcI \u2212 L(z)) = 0.\n\n(36)\n\n2t(\u03bc) \u2212 (z + z \u22121 ) = 0,\n\n(37)\n\nIt's of the form\nwhere 2t(\u03bc) = \u03bc2 \u2212 (p1 + p2 )\u03bc + f (q1 \u2212 q2 , p1 p2 ) is a polynomial of degree two. By a change\nof variables, x = \u03bc, y = z \u2212 t(\u03bc), the curve becomes\ny 2 = t2 (x) \u2212 1.\n\n(38)\n\nThis is the same curve as (6) modula a further coordinates change. Now let us substitute \u03bc\nby the differential \u2202z , then formally we can get a second order differential equation through\ndet(I\u2202z \u2212 L(z)).\n\n(39)\n\nIt's easy to see that after some proper coordinates changes this is the Mathieu differential\noperator. So in some sense, the Mathieu equation defines a \"quantum torus\". Actually,\n9\n\n\fTalalaev has constructed the \"quantum spectral curve\" for general integrable systems along\nthis way[15].\nIt is possible that the relation we present here is just a particular case of a general picture. As an example, the spectral curve for the two body elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable\nsystem is an elliptic curve closely related to (6)(elliptic curves always can be written in the\nWeierstrass form), and its quantization leads to the Lam\u00e9 equation. See a recent discussion\nin [16].\nAnother example is the direct generalization of the case we present here, the spectral\ncurve for the N-body AN periodic Toda chain is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g = N \u2212 1,\n\nwith N \u2265 3. The Gutzwiller's quantization scheme of periodic Toda chain introduces a rather\ninvolved Bethe-like quantization condition which involves both the Floquet exponents and\nthe integrals of motion[17]. Recently in [18] the quantization condition has been rewritten in a\nfunctional form that only involves the Floquet exponents of the associated Hill's determinant.\nWe wonder if the idea presented here can be generalized to higher genus curves and provide\na solution to the eigenvalue problem of periodic Toda chain. Note that for a N-particle Toda\nsystem, there are N \u2212 1 independent Floquet exponents \u03bdi , i = 1, 2, * * * , N \u2212 1(the condition\nPN\ni=1 \u03bdi = 0 just reduces the center of mass motion, or is the traceless condition for the SU(N)\ngroup), and for the associated hyperelliptic curve there are 2(N \u2212 1) independent homology\n\ncycles \u03b1i and \u03b2i . There are also a meromorphic one form and its WKB descendants on the\ncurve. The differential forms involve exactly N \u22121 coefficients Ik , with k = 2, 3, * * * , N, which\n\nare the integrals of motion of Toda chain. Among the integrals of motions I2 is interpreted\nas energy while Ik for k \u2265 3 have no physical interpretation. There is evidence that the\nFloquet exponents \u03bdi are given by integrals of these differential forms along the homology\ncycles on the hyperelliptic curve [19]. This is enough to determine the functional relations\nbetween the Floquet exponents and the integrals of motion \u03bdi = \u03bdi (I2 , I3 , * * * , IN ). There\n(0)\n\nare 2(N \u2212 1) asymptotic expansion points at Ik >> 1 and at the dual points Ik \u223c Ik . The\n(0)\ncritical values Ik are determined by the Chebyshev polynomial [20]. If the N \u2212 1 integral\ncycles are chosen as (\u03b1{i} , \u03b2{j} ), satisfying {i} \u2286 {1, 2, * * * N \u2212 1}, {j} \u2286 {1, 2, * * * N \u2212 1}\nand {i} \u222a {j} = {1, 2, * * * , N \u2212 1}, {i} \u2229 {j} = \u2205, then functions \u03bd{i} = \u03bd{i} (I2 , I3 , * * * , IN )\n\nhave asymptotic expansions at Ik >> 1, while \u03bd{j} = \u03bd{j} (I2 , I3 , * * * , IN ) have asymptotic\n(0)\nexpansions at Ik \u2212 Ik << 1. By reversing the Floquet exponents \u03bdi = \u03bdi (I2 , I3 , * * * , IN ) we\nobtain the eigenvalues Ik = Ik (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , * * * , \u03bdN \u22121 ).\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nY-G.M was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under\ngrant No.10675061.\n\nReferences\n[1] \u00c9.
