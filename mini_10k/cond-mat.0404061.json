Further progress can be made by examining\nthe bulk properties of Nax CoO2 *yH2 O as a function of x\nand y in order to elucidate the intriguing physics found\non the phase diagram.\nIn this paper, we present a systematic study of the\nmagnetic susceptibility of Nax CoO2 *yH2 O (with x \u2243\n0.75, 0.67, 0.5, 0.3 and y \u2243 0, 0.6, 1.3) using single-crystal\nsamples produced by an electrochemical de-intercalation\nmethod.6,7 Our results show that the susceptibilities of\nour crystals are consistent with the behavior reported\nin powder samples prepared differently via chemical Br2\nde-intercalation. In addition, our studies reveal that the\nsusceptibility is clearly anisotropic. We further report\nhow the susceptibility changes as a function of both Na\nand H2 0 content. The paper is arranged as follows: Section II contains experimental details and initial sample\ncharacterization. Section III contains the results of our\nsusceptibility measurements, along with analysis of our\ndata. A discussion of our results and conclusions are in\nSection IV.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nSingle crystals of Na0.75 CoO2 were grown using the\nfloating-zone technique. After an additional electrochemical de-intercalation procedure, samples were produced\nwith the final Na concentrations of x = 0.75, 0.67, 0.5\nand 0.3, as confirmed by Electron Microprobe Analysis. Details of the crystal growth process, electrochemical de-intercalation, and characterization of the resulting\nsamples are discussed in depth in Ref. [7]. Powder neutron diffraction on a crushed single crystal of Na0.75 CoO2\ngrown under similar conditions as the samples presented\nhere indicates that the crystalline boule consists of a\nsingle structural phase.8 A crystal of Na0.7 CoO2 was\ngrown using the flux method. The crystal was obtained from a melt prepared from powder mixtures of\nNa0.75 CoO2 +4 NaCl+4 Na2 CO3 +B2 O3 which was slowly\ncooled from 920\u25e6 C to 820\u25e6 C at a rate of -1\u25e6 C/hr.\nA fully hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O crystal was prepared by enclosing a non-hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 crystal\nwithin a water vapor saturated environment for \u223c4\nmonths. After this period of hydration, the crystal consisted of a single phase with a c-axis lattice constant of\n19.56(8) \u00c5 and with a superconducting transition temperature near \u223c 4.2 K. Partially hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 *\n0.6 H2 O samples and a fully dehydrated Na0.3 CoO2 samples were obtained by driving water out by annealing at\ntemperatures of 120\u25e6C and 220\u25e6 C, respectively, for 15\nhours. Except for a small fraction of a Co3 O4 impurity\nphase generated in the fully dehydrated crystal, the partially hydrated and fully dehydrated phases have c-axis\nlattice constants of 13.74(3) \u00c5 and 11.11(5) \u00c5, respectively, which are in agreement with previously reported\nvalues of Na0.3 CoO2 *0.6 H2 O and Na0.3 CoO2 .9 In principal, the fully dehydrated (FD) phase should be identical\nto the original non-hydrated phase. Powder x-ray diffraction results confirm that the two phases share the same\nprimary powder peaks; however, the FD sample contains\n\n\f2\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\n0.0015\nNa\n\nCoO\n\n0.67\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n3\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\n//ab\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n//c\n0.0005\nNa\n\n0.75\n\nCoO\n\n2\n\nNa CoO\n0.3\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\n0\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\na somewhat higher degree of defects which we will discuss\nfurther below.\nMeasurements of the magnetic susceptibility were performed using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer. The typical size of the crystals used in these\nmeasurements were 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 mm3 with mass \u223c 50 mg.\nThese pieces were easily cleaved from the larger floatingzone boule with the larger surface area corresponding to\nthe ab-plane. All data were measured under a magnetic\nfield of 1 Tesla through both zero cooled and zero-field\ncooled sequences. Slightly hysteretic behavior was observed for the x = 0.75 sample near temperatures of\n\u223c22 K and \u223c320 K, consistent with previous observations.10,11 Since the focus of this paper is not on the\nhysteretic behavior, all of the data presented are based\non the zero-field cooled results. A background correction\nto the susceptibility has been made on the crystals with\nx = 0.67 and 0.3. The source of this background is likely\ndue to a small amount of CoO impurities (about a 7 %\nmass fraction) imbedded between the grain boundaries\nof the particular starting boule of Na0.75 CoO2 . The CoO\ncorrection was implemented as to minimize the contribution from the antiferromagnetic transition (TN \u223c290K)\nof CoO, while maintaining the same magnitude of the\nsusceptibility as a powder sample of the same stoichiometry.7 No correction was applied to the Na0.75 CoO2 and\nNa0.5 CoO2 crystals, where no anomaly at T\u223c290 K is\nfound and the powder averaged data agrees with the data\nfrom stoichiometric polycrystalline samples. We note,\nhowever, there is a broad maximum near \u223c 275 K for\nthe Na0.67 CoO2 crystal, which may be intrinsic, as this\nis also reported by others.10\n\n0\n\n//ab\n\n0.0005\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n//c\n\n400\n\nNa CoO\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nT (K)\n\n2\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Magnetic susceptibilities of Nax CoO2\n(x = 0.75, 0.67, 0.5, and 0.3) under a magnetic field of 1 Tesla.\nThe red and blue symbols are for the magnetic field applied\nalong the ab- and c- directions, respectively.\n0.0012\n\nNa CoO\nx\n\nx= 0.67\n\nx= 0.75\n\n2\n\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\n2.5\n\n0.0008\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIII.\n\n(cm /mole)\n\n0.001\n\nF\n\nOur magnetic susceptibility data for Nax CoO2 (x =\n0.3, 0.5, 0.67, and 0.75) are shown in Fig. 1, where a magnetic field of 1 Tesla was applied parallel to the ab- and\nc- directions. Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed for\nx > 0.5, but samples with x < 0.5 show a monotonic\nincrease of \u03c7 with increasing temperature. Our results,\nwhen powder-averaged, agree with the published powder\nmeasurements on samples prepared using chemical Br2\nde-intercalation.4 For example, the sample with x = 0.5\nshows anomalies in the susceptibility at T \u223c 88 K and\n\u223c 53 K, consistent with that reported by Foo et.al.4 .\nMoreover, we find that the anomaly at 88 K is only apparent in \u03c7ab .\nThese measurements on single crystals yield additional\ninformation on the spin anisotropy for the various compositions. In Fig. 2, plots of \u03c7ab versus \u03c7c are shown for all\ncrystals for temperatures between 50 and 250 K, where T\nis an implicit parameter.

We then write\n\u25e6\ne\nthe temperature-dependent term in the form \u03c7ab,c\n(T ) =\ne\n(gab,c )2 f (T ), which assumes that the anisotropy of the\nspin susceptibility \u03c7e results from an anisotropic g-factor.\nNote that the g-factor for localized spins is related to the\nspin-orbit coupling, and the effective g-factor for delocalized electrons is related to the coupling between the\napplied field and the total angular momentum of the system. This leads to the following relation between \u03c7ab (T )\nand \u03c7c (T ):\n2 c\n\u03c7ab (T ) = (gab /gc )2 \u03c7c (T ) + [\u03c7ab\n\u25e6 \u2212 (gab /gc ) \u03c7\u25e6 ].\n\nThe main point of this analysis is that the fitted slope of\nthe data in Fig. 2 corresponds to the ratio (gab /gc )2 . This\nratio is plotted as a function of x in the inset of Fig. 2.\nThe sample with x = 0.67 has the largest anisotropy of\ngab /gc \u223c 1.45, whereas the sample with x = 0.3 is nearly\nisotropic. This behavior further highlights the unusual\nmetallic state which exists in the phase diagram for x >\n0.5.\nThe samples with x > 0.5 can be further analyzed\nby fitting the high-temperature susceptibility to a CurieWeiss law, \u03c7 = \u03c7\u25e6 + C/T . The fits were performed over\nthe range T = 50 \u2212 250 K, and the fit parameters for\nboth field orientations, as well as the powder average, are\nshown in Table 1. For comparison purposes, results from\ndata taken on a flux-grown crystal with x = 0.7 is also\nshown. We find that the results of the fits have a small dependence on the choice of the temperature range selected.\nOverall, however, the fits appear to converge with an error less than 15%. The temperature-independent value\nfor \u03c7\u25e6 agrees well with the estimate of the orbital contribution (\u223c2*10\u22124 cm3 /mole) from Knight shift analysis\nof 59 Co NMR.12\nThe fitted values for the powder average of the single crystal with x = 0.75 yield a Curie constant of C \u223c\n0.147 K-cm3 /mole, \u03c7\u25e6 \u223c 2 \u2217 10\u22124 cm3 /mole, and Weiss\ntemperature \u03b8 \u223c \u2212125 K.

Both are\ntaken from powder averaged values shown in Table I\n\nsuring five different batches of powder Na0.75 CoO2 samples (not shown). All Curie constants fall reliably near\n0.149\u00b10.025 K-cm3 /mole. As expected, we find that the\nCurie constants for H k c and H k ab are significantly\ndifferent for the crystal sample. This may arise from an\nanisotropic g-factor as discussed above. In addition, it is\nlikely that part of the axial variation of \u03c7 results from\nspin anisotropy of the localized Co4+ moment.\nThe effective moment of the Co4+ ion can be calculated\nfrom the powder averaged Curie constant. If we assume\nthat the Curie-Weiss behavior originates from the formal\n1 \u2212 x fraction of Co4+ moments\nwith S = 1/2, then the\n\u221a\neffective moment \u03bcef f = g (S(S + 1)\u03bcB \u2243 2.2 \u03bcB and\ng \u2243 2.5 for the x = 0.75 sample. This value for the\n2\npowder averaged g-factor, where g 2 = (2/3 \u2217 gab\n+ 1/3 \u2217\n2\ngc ), can be used to estimate gc and gab using our data\nfor \u03c7ab (T )/\u03c7c(T ). We obtain the values gab \u2243 2.7 and\ngc \u2243 2.0. Alternatively, the value of the Curie constant\nis consistent with an interpretation in which the effective\nlocal moment is \u223c1.1 \u03bcB averaged over all of the Co\nions. In either interpretation, the coexistence of localized\nspins and metallic behavior in this compound remains an\nintriguing issue to understand.\nThe results of our fits to the Curie-Weiss law are summarized in Fig. 3. The Curie constant decreases precipitously with decreasing x. This implies that while almost\nall of the Co4+ spins are localized for x = 0.75 (assuming\nthe value g \u2243 2.5 from above), the fraction of localized\nspins drops sharply as the Na content is reduced. Local\nmoment behavior disappears almost entirely for x = 0.5.\n\n\f4\n\nMagnetic susceptibility of Na0.3 CoO2 *yH2 O\n\nNa CoO .1.3H O\n2\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\n0.3\n\n//ab\n0.0005\n\n//c\n\n0\n\nNa CoO .0.6H O\n2\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\n0.3\n\n0.0005\n\n0\n\nNa CoO\n0.3\n\n2\n\n0.001\n\n3\n\n2.\n\n0.0015\n\nM/H (cm /mole)\n\nIn parallel with the loss of local moments, the magnitude\nof the Weiss temperature decreases drastically with decreasing x. The Weiss temperature of about -125 K for\nx = 0.75 suggests antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations\nbetween Co4+ spins. There is a clear reduction in the\nstrength of the AF correlations as x decreases towards\nx = 0.5. These results demonstrate that de-intercalating\nNa from Na0.75 CoO2 modifies the spin system from one\ndescribed by localized spins to one described by delocalized spins with weaker magnetic coupling.\nWe find the susceptibilities of the two samples with\nx = 0.3 and x = 0.5 are almost identical (within the\nerrors) above \u223c100 K as shown in Fig. 1, similar to that\nreported previously in powder samples.4 Interestingly, we\nfind that our non-hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 sample develops\nsmall anomalies near T = 53 K and T = 88 K, after the\ncrystal was stored in air for more than 6 months. This\nsuggests that some degree of Na phase separation may\noccur over long time scales. In our Na0.5 CoO2 sample,\nthe susceptibility cusp at T \u2243 53 K is nearly isotropic,\nwhereas the one near T \u2243 88 K is clearly anisotropic.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibilities of single crystal samples of Na0.3 CoO2 *yH2 O (with y \u2243 0, 0.6, 1.3) are shown\nin Fig. 4. These data were taken on a single sample\nwhich originally had the composition Na0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O\nand was subsequently annealed to reduce the water content to y = 0.6 and then y = 0. All three samples show nearly temperature-independent susceptibilities with weak Curie-Weiss-like behavior developing below \u223c 200 K. As water is driven out, the anisotropy of\nthe susceptibility is reduced, and, at the same time, the\nCurie behavior above 50 K becomes slightly enhanced.\nIn addition, the fully dehydrated crystal is observed to\nhave a small Co3 O4 impurity phase, likely caused by the\ndehydration process due to partial decomposition. By fitting the susceptibility above T = 50 K for the fully dehydrated crystal to a Curie law, we find that the Curie constant is isotropic and corresponds to about \u223c 6% isolated\nCo4+ ions. We can therefore identify this as an impurity\ncontribution, and this term has been subtracted from the\ndata in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The Curie corrected\nsusceptibility data for this fully dehydrated Na0.3 CoO2\ncrystal are very similar to the data for the non-hydrated\nNa0.3 CoO2 crystal shown in Fig. 1 (which do not require\nthis correction). There is a cusp in the susceptibility\nnear T \u223c 42 K for both the fully hydrated and partially\nhydrated crystal, which we will discuss further below.\nIn Fig. 5, we plot \u03c7ab versus \u03c7c , which again has a remarkably linear dependence. An anisotropic Curie-Weiss\nlaw \u03c7\u25e6 + C/(T \u2212 \u03b8) has been used to fit both directions.\nThe complete list of fit parameters (above 50K) is shown\nin Table 2. Both Cab /Cc and (gab /gc)2 are plotted in\nthe inset of Fig. 5.

The third panel for Na0.3 CoO2\nshows data both before (lines) and after (symbols) a Curie\ntail was subtracted.\n\nhydrated samples. This indicates that the paramagnetic\nmoments which give rise to the Curie-Weiss behavior\nabove 50 K are not isotropic, but are strongly affected\nby the anisotropic orbital environment. Hence, this magnetic signal likely is intrinsic to the crystalline phase.\nSuch Curie-Weiss behavior is absent in the non-hydrated\nNa0.3 CoO2 sample shown previously in Fig. 1. The Curie\nconstant for the fully hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O crystal (\u223c 0.0036 K-cm3 /mole) suggests about \u223c1% of the\nspins (S = 1/2 and g 2 \u223c 6.3) in the system are localized.\nThese localized spins may be related to defects formed\nduring hydration as a result of local structure deformation. However, their origin remains a topic for further\ninvestigation. Enhanced Curie-like behavior has been reported in powder samples prepared with the chemical Br2\nde-intercalation method by Sakurai and coworkers.13 We\nnote that the Curie behavior observed below 30 K in our\nsamples has a similar degree of anisotropy as the high-\n\n\f5\nTABLE\nII:\nCurie-Weiss\nNa0.3 CoO2 .*yH2 O\nkab\nkab\nkab\nkc\nkc\nkc\nPowder\nPowder\nPowder\n\nfitting\n\ny=1.3\n.000634\n.00474\n10.2\n.000334\n.00160\n21.2\n.000533\n.00363\n14.0\n\n\u03c7\u25e6\nC\n\u03b8\n\u03c7\u25e6\nC\n\u03b8\n\u03c7\u25e6\nC\n\u03b8\n\nparameters\n\ny=0.6\n.000472\n.0167\n-20.6\n.000360\n.00954\n-4.12\n.000444\n.0119\n-5.93\n\nfor\n\ny=0\n.000476\n.0385\n-26.7\n.000383\n.0327\n-20.4\n.000441\n.0380\n-27.6\n\n0.001\n\nNa CoO .yH O\n0.3\n\n0.0008\n\ny = 1.3\n\n0.0007\n\n2\n\n2\n\ny=0\n\ny = 0.6\n\nF\n\nab\n\n3\n\n(cm /mole)\n\n0.0009\n\nC /C\n\n2.5\n\n0.0006\n\nab\n\nc\n\n2\n\n0.0005\n\n1.5\n\n0.0004\n\n1\n\n(g /g )\nab\n\n0\n\n0.0003\n0.0003\n\n0.0004\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0006\n3\n\n0.0007\n\nF (cm /mole)\n\n0.6\ny\n\n2\n\nc\n\n1.2\n\n0.0008\n\n0.0009\n\nc\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) \u03c7ab versus \u03c7c for Na0.3 CoO2 *yH2 O\nwith y = 0, 0.6 and 1.3. The inset shows the fitted slope which\ncorresponds to (gab /gc )2 and Curie constant ratio (Cab /Cc )\nas described in the text. The lines serve as guides for the eye.\n\ntemperature susceptibility. Hence, this behavior likely\noriginates from defects intrinsic to the crystalline phase.\nTwo major differences are made apparent by comparing the susceptibility data of the fully hydrated (FH)\nNa0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O and non-hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 crystals displayed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4. First, the FH sample\nhas a larger anisotropy. Second, the FH sample has a\nlarger total susceptibility. The larger anisotropy likely\nresults from the structural changes of the CoO layers\ncaused by the hydration. The higher susceptibility may\nresult from a change in \u03c7vv or \u03c7pauli , although we cannot separate these two contributions independently. We\nnote that NMR measurements show that the 59 Co Knight\nshift is significantly enhanced upon hydration,12 consistent with our findings. If the susceptibility increase is\ndominated by \u03c7vv , a smaller t2g splitting would indicate\na less distorted CoO6 octahedra. However, the neutron\npowder results of Lynn et al. indicate that a fully hydrated sample actually has a larger octahedral distortion\ncompared with a non-hydrated one.14 On the other hand,\nif \u03c7pauli is dominant, this implies that the fully hydrated\nsample has a higher density of states at the Fermi level.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the cuprate superconductors, it is generally found\nthat gc is larger than gab .15,16 We find that Nax CoO2 *\n1.3H2 O has the opposite relation (gab /gc) > 1. A significant difference between these families of materials is\nthe orientation of the oxygen octahedra around the Cu\nand Co ions. In La2 CuO4 , for example, the octahedral\nCu-O axes are nearly parallel with the tetragonal crystallographic axes. On the other hand, in Nax CoO2 * yH2 O,\nthe z-axis of the crystal field (in Co-O coordinates)\nis tilted away from the crystallographic c-direction by\nnearly \u223c 60\u25e6 . In addition, the CoO6 octahedra are distorted (compressed along the (111) direction in Co-O coordinates) from the ideal configuration.14,17\nThe g-tensor can be calculated from g\u03bc\u03bd = 2(\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u03bb\u039b\u03bc\u03bd ), where \u03bb is the spin-orbit coupling constant and\nP <0|L\u03bc |n><n|L\u03bd |0> 18\n. In a simple ionic pic\u039b\u03bc\u03bd =\nn\nEn \u2212E0\nture, each Co4+ ion is in the low-spin state with an\nunpaired electron in the a1g orbital, higher in energy\nthan the Eg doublet by an amount \u2206.19 In order to calculate the g-tensor with respect to the crystallographic\naxes, the orbital wave functions can be transformed from\nthe original Co-O coordinates within the CoO6 octahe20\ndra to the crystal coordinates\u221a in the following\n\u221a way\n2 \u2212r 2 ,\n|a1g i = d3z\n|E\ni\n=\n(\n2d\n+\nd\n)/\n3,\nand\n1g\nxy\nyz\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|E2g i = (\u2212 2dx2 \u2212y2 + dxz )/ 3. Using this, we find that\ngc = 2, independent of the \u03bb/\u2206 ratio. This is consistent\nwith our estimate of gc from the analysis of our susceptibility data. The values for ga and gb are expected to\nbe larger than 2 so long as \u03bb is negative. We note that\nthis model neglects effects due to hybridization, which\nmay be significant.21 Recent local density approximation\n(LDA) calculations by Marianetti and coworkers21 show\nthat electrons in the t2g orbitals are accompanied by a\nredistribution of the charge in the hybridized eg and oxygen orbitals.\nWe remark further on the 42 K anomaly observed in\nboth fully hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O and partially hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 * 0.6H2 O crystals (shown previously in\nFig. 4). This anomaly is much weaker or absent in the\nfully dehydrated and non-hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 crystals.\nHence, we conclude that the anomaly results from the\nhydration process. However, it is not clear at this point\nif this reflects the intrinsic behavior of the hydrated sample, or if it originates from an impurity phase. We note\nthat the 42 K anomaly does not exist in fully hydrated\npowder samples, irrespective of chemical or electrochemical de-intercalation. It is therefore tempting to assign the\n42 K anomaly to the existence of a Co3 O4 impurity, especially since the bulk AF transition temperature of Co3 O4\noccurs around \u223c 33 K. However, hysteretic behavior is\nobserved near 42 K (not shown), which is not expected\nfrom a Co3 O4 impurity phase. Sasaki and coworkers have\nalso reported a 42 K anomaly in hydrated single crystal\nsamples.22 They proposed that it originates from residual oxygen on the surface of the crystal. However, if this\nis only a surface effect, powder samples should show a\nmore pronounced 42 K anomaly under the same treatment. Unlike studies on Kx CoO2 powder samples, where\n\n\f6\na Co3 O4 inclusion can be reliably subtracted from the total susceptibility,23 we cannot completely eliminate the\nanomaly near 42 K with a simple subtraction of a Co3 O4\n(TN \u223c 33K) impurity phase.\nIn summary, we have presented a systematic study\nof the magnetic susceptibility of Nax CoO2 *yH2 O (with\n0.3 < x < 0.75 and y \u223c 0, 0.6 and 1.3) using single crystal samples. For non-hydrated samples, we find\nthat the derived anisotropic g-factor ratio (gab /gc) decreases significantly as the composition is changed from\nthe Curie-Weiss metal with x = 0.75 to the paramagnetic metal with x = 0.3. We confirm that a model of\nlocalized Co4+ spins describes the spin susceptibility of\nNa0.75 CoO2 . However, the fraction of localized spins decreases precipitously upon de-intercalation. For the composition with x=0.3, the anisotropy in the susceptibility\nbecomes more pronounced with increasing hydration. In\naddition, the magnitude of the susceptibility is larger in\nfully hydrated Na0.3 CoO2 *1.3H2 O than in non-hydrated\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nOn leave from Physics Department, Pusan National University, Korea.\nK.
