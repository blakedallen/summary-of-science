This is because the\nobservation of different charged states is closely related\nto their production rates, which are still not known. In\n\u2217+\naddition, if it is assigned to Ds0\n, it is not easy to satisfy\nthe severest experimental constraint on the ratio [2],\nRexp \u2261\n\n+\n\u0393(Ds0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3)\n+\n\u0393(Ds0 (2317) \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 )\n\n< 0.059,\n\n(1)\n\nexp\n\nas discussed in Refs. [10] and [11]. In particular, the\nheavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory [12] provides a\nratio (of leading order) that is larger by at least a factor of 2 than the upper bound given in Eq. (1), and the\nresult of the next-to-leading order includes too many unknown parameters to give a definite prediction for this\nratio. It has also been argued that this ratio would be\nlarger than unity if this resonance were assigned to a\nDK molecule. In this article, therefore, we study the\n+\n+\nDs0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3 and Ds0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 decays\nrather phenomenologically (without considering the details of models) and demonstrate that Eq. (1) can be\n+\neasily satisfied if Ds0\n(2317) is assigned to the iso-triplet\nscalar four-quark meson, F\u0302I+ \u223c [cn][s\u0304n\u0304]I=1 (n = u, d),\nwhile it is difficult to reconcile its assignment to an I = 0\n\u2217+\nstate (the conventional scalar, Ds0\n\u223c {cs\u0304}, or the scalar\n+\nfour-quark, F\u03020 \u223c [cn][s\u0304n\u0304]I=0 ) with Eq. (1). (For notation of four-quark mesons, see Ref. [6].) The possible existence of such four-quark states has also been\nsuggested for light flavor mesons (the nonet of [qq][q\u0304 q\u0304],\n\u03b4\u0302 s , \u03c3\u0302 s , \u03c3\u0302, \u03ba\u0302) [13, 14, 15], which would correspond to\nthe observed light scalar mesons [16], a0 (980), f0 (980),\n\u03c3(600) and \u03ba(800) [17], respectively. Therefore, we assign the observed scalar nonet to the [qq][q\u0304 q\u0304] nonet, so\nthat we can easily determine the approximate degeneracy between the observed a0 (980) and f0 (980).\n+\nIf Ds0\n(2317) is assigned to F\u0302I+ , its decay into Ds+ \u03c0 0 can\n\nproceed through isospin-conserving strong interactions.\nTherefore, it was naively conjectured that the decay is of\nthe so-called fall-apart type and that it has a high rate\n(\u223c 100 MeV or more) [4]. However, this argument is\nquite naive, as seen below. A four-quark [qq][q\u0304 q\u0304] state can\nbe decomposed into a sum of products of {q q\u0304} pairs with\ndifferent color and spin, and their coefficients are given\nby the crossing matrices for color and spin [13]. The Ds+\nand \u03c0 0 in the decay F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 are color-less and spinless, and the corresponding coefficient is much smaller\nthan unity; i.e., the overlap of the wave functions of the\ninitial F\u0302I+ and the final Ds+ \u03c0 0 is small. In this way, the\nnarrow width of F\u0302I+ can be understood [18, 19] as seen\nmore explicitly below. The rate for a decay A \u2192 BC is\ngiven by\n\u0393(A \u2192 BC)\n=\n\n1\n2JA + 1\n\n!\n\nqc\n8\u03c0m2A\n\n!\n\nX\nspin\n\n|M (A \u2192 BC)|2 , (2)\n\nwhere JA and mA denote the spin and mass, respectively,\nof the parent particle A, and qc the center-of-mass momentum of the final particle. The amplitude for the decay\nF\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 , as an example, can be approximated as\n!\nm2F\u0302 \u2212 m2Ds\n+\n+ 0\nI\nhDs+ |A\u03c00 |F\u0302I+ i (3)\nM (F\u0302I \u2192 Ds \u03c0 ) \u2243\nf\u03c0 0\nby using a hard pion technique with the PCAC (partially conserved axial-vector current) in the infinite momentum frame (IMF) [20, 21]. The asymptotic matrix\nelement of A\u03c0 (i.e., the matrix element of A\u03c0 between\nsingle hadron states with infinite momentum), hB|A\u03c0 |Ai,\ngives the dimensionless AB\u03c0 coupling strength. Here,\nwe compare F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 with \u03b4\u0302 s+ \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + by using asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry (roughly speaking, the\nSUf (4) symmetry of the asymptotic matrix elements).\nThe above-mentioned hard pion technique, the asymptotic flavor symmetry and their important results are\nreviewed comprehensively in Ref. [21]. The amplitude\nfor \u03b4\u0302 s+ \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + is obtained by replacing (F\u0302I+ , Ds+ , \u03c0 0 )\nby (\u03b4\u0302 s+ , \u03b7, \u03c0 + ) in Eq. (3). The usual \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing [16]\n\n\f2\nleads to \u03b7 = cos \u0398 * \u03b7 n \u2212 sin \u0398 * \u03b7 s , where \u03b7 n and \u03b7 s are\nthe {nn\u0304} and {ss\u0304} components\u221aof \u03b7, respectively, and\n\u0398 = \u03c7 + \u03b8P , with cos \u03c7 = 1/ 3 and the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing\nangle \u03b8P \u2243 \u221220\u25e6 , which implies that the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing is\nfar from the ideal one. Because only the \u03b7 s component\nsurvives in the matrix element h\u03b7|A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i, due to the\nOZI rule, we have h\u03b7|A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i = \u2212 sin \u0398 * h\u03b7 s |A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i.\nA naive application of the asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry\n\u221a\nyields 2hDs+ |A\u03c00 |F\u0302I+ i = h\u03b7 s |A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i. This estimation, however, is too naive, since the wave function overlapping in F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 is small, as seen above, while this\nis not the case in \u03b4\u0302 s+ \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + , because gluon exchanges in\nthe system, which are more often at a lower energy scale,\nreshuffle color configurations and spin configurations and\ncause configuration mixings. As a result, the \u03b4\u0302 s+ \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 +\ndecay would be nearly of the fall-apart type. Therefore,\nwe modify the previously employed asymptotic SUf (4)\nrelation with asymptotic matrix elements (including fourquark mesons) by introducing the parameter\n\u221a\n2hDs+ |A\u03c00 |F\u0302I+ i\n\u03b2=\n.\n(4)\nh\u03b7 s |A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i\nIn the naive limit of the asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry,\nwe have \u03b2 = 1, as seen above. We hereafter refer to\nthe symmetry in the \u03b2 6= 1 case as the modified asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry. For simplicity, we consider the\nlimiting case in which there is no configuration mixing\nfor F\u0302I+ , while there is no suppression arising from the\ncrossing matrices for \u03b4\u0302 s+ (and there is maximum mixing\nof the color and spin configurations). In this case, we\n1\nhave |\u03b2|2 = 12\nfrom the crossing matrices for color and\nspin [13]. Inserting |h\u03b7 s |A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i| \u223c 0.8 obtained from\nthe tentative value \u0393(a0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + ) \u2243 70 MeV (noting that\nthe measured rate is 50 \u2212 100 MeV [16]), we obtain\n\u0393(F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 ) \u223c 9 MeV.\n\n(5)\n\n1\nhas\nHere a0 (980) has been assigned to \u03b4\u0302 s , and |\u03b2|2 \u2243 12\nbeen assumed. This result seems to be slightly larger\n+\nthan the measured width of Ds0\n(2317) [16] but still consistent with the data if the SUf (4) symmetry breaking\narising from the overlapping of spatial wavefunctions that\nwas not considered above is taken into account. (Note\nhere that the asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry transforming q \u2192 c overestimates the size of the asymptotic matrix elements involving a charmed meson state [19] by\n\u223c 20 \u2212 30 %.) This suggests that the situation considered above, in which the strong interactions are perturbative at the scale of charm meson mass while they are\nnon-perturbative at a scale <\n\u223c 1 GeV, is approximately\nrealized, at least in the system under consideration here.\nIn this case, the strange quark will be rather slim (with\na smaller mass) at the scale of the charm meson mass, as\nwill be briefly discussed later.\n+\nWhen Ds0\n(2317) is assigned to an I = 0 state (the\n\u2217+\nconventional scalar Ds0\nor the four-quark F\u03020+ ), the\n\n\u2217+\ndecay Ds0\n\u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 or F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 does not conserve isospin. As is well known, isospin violating phenomena (e.g., the difference between d-u quark masses,\n\u2206m\u03c0 = m\u03c0\u00b1 \u2212 m\u03c00 , \u2206mK = mK 0 \u2212 mK + , etc.) have\nbeen considered as second-order effects of QED [22], and\nthe isospin non-conserving \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing [23, 24] could be\nof the same origin. (However, this is not assumed in\nthis article.) Therefore, the isospin non-conserving de\u2217+\ncay Ds0\n\u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 or F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 , which is assumed\nbelow to proceed through \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing, is conjectured intuitively to be (much) weaker than the radiative decay,\nin contrast with the results obtained from specific models [12, 25, 26, 27].\nBefore studying isospin non-conserving decays of Ds\u2217+ ,\n\u2217+\nDs0 and F\u03020+ , we first investigate their radiative decays under the vector meson dominance (VMD) hypothesis [28] with the flavor SUf (4) symmetry for the strong\nvertices and then compare the results with those for the\nDs+ \u03c0 0 decays. Because the VMD hypothesis with the\nideal \u03c9-\u03c6 mixing and the flavor SUf (3) for the strong\nvertices works fairly well for the radiative decays of light\nvector mesons [29], we extend it to a system containing\ncharm quarks below. The V \u2192 P \u03b3 amplitude can be\nwritten in the form\n\nM (V \u2192 P \u03b3) = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 G\u03bc\u03bd (V )F\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b3)A(V \u2192 P \u03b3),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere V , P and A(V \u2192 P \u03b3) denote a vector meson, a\npseudoscalar meson, and the V P \u03b3 coupling strength, respectively, and G\u03bc\u03bd (V ) and F\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b3) are the field strengths\nof a vector meson (V ) and a photon (\u03b3), respectively.\nWith the VMD hypothesis, A(V \u2192 P \u03b3) can be approximated as\n\"\n#\nX\nXV \u2032 (0)\nA(V \u2192 P \u03b3) \u2243\nA(V \u2192 P V \u2032 ), (7)\n2\nm\n\u2032\nV\n\u2032\n0\nV =\u03c1 , \u03c9, \u03c6, \u03c8\n\nwhere A(V \u2192 P V \u2032 ) denotes the V P V \u2032 coupling strength\nand XV (0) is the \u03b3V coupling strength on the photon\nmass shell. (The photon-momentum-square dependence\nof XV is studied in Ref. [29].) The values of the quantities XV (0) have been estimated from analyses of the\nphotoproduction of vector mesons in scattering from various nuclei [30]. For \u03c8 photoproduction, both the measured differential cross section at t = 0 and the \u03c8N total cross section estimated from the A dependence of\nthe photoproduction cross sections still have large uncertainties. (Here N denotes a nucleon.) The necessary values of XV (0) thus obtained using existing data\non the photoproduction of vector mesons are as follows:\nX\u03c1 (0) = 0.033 \u00b1 0.003 GeV2 , X\u03c9 (0) = 0.011 \u00b1 0.001\nGeV2 , X\u03c6 (0) = \u22120.018 \u00b1 0.004 GeV2 and X\u03c8 (0) \u223c 0.054\nGeV2 .) [The last value was obtained from d\u03c3(\u03b3N \u2192\n\u03c8N )/dt|t=0 \u2243 20 nb/GeV2 and \u03c3T (\u03c8N ) = 3.5 \u00b1 0.8\nmb [31] for the \u03c8N total cross section.] The values of\nX\u03c6 (0) and X\u03c8 (0) are considerably smaller than those\nof X\u03c6 (m2\u03c6 ) and X\u03c8 (m2\u03c8 ) estimated from the measured\nrates for the lepton-pair decays of \u03c6 and \u03c8, respectively.\n\n\f3\nAlso, the V P V \u2032 coupling strength can be estimated from\nthe measured rate for the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decay: Setting\n(V, P, V \u2032 ) = (\u03c9, \u03c0 0 , \u03c10 ) in Eq. (7) and inserting the above\nvalue of X\u03c1 (0), we obtain\n|A(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c10 )| \u2243 18 GeV\u22121\n\n(8)\n\nfrom \u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)exp = 0.734 \u00b1 0.035 MeV [16].\nTo estimate the uncertainties arising from the VMD\nand the SUf (4) symmetry for V P V \u2032 vertices, we focus on\nthe D\u2217 \u2192 D\u03b3 decays. The amplitudes A(D\u2217 \u2192 D\u03b3) are\ngiven by the \u03c10 , \u03c9 and \u03c8-meson poles. Using the SUf (4)\nrelations,\n2A(D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c10 ) = 2A(D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03c9) =\n\u221a\n\u22170\n0\n\u2217+\n\u2192 D+ \u03c10 ) = 2A(D\u2217+ \u2192\n2A(D \u2192\n\u221a D \u03c8)\u2217+= \u22122A(D\n+\n+\nD \u03c9) = 2A(D\n\u2192 D \u03c8) = A(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c10 ), and\nEq. (8), we obtain \u0393(D\u2217+ \u2192 D+ \u03b3) \u223c 2.4 keV and\n\u0393(D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03b3) \u223c 19 keV. The former is consistent with\n\u0393(D\u2217+ \u2192 D+ \u03b3)exp \u2243 1.5 keV (with \u223c 30 % uncertainty)\nif a possible reduction by \u223c 40\u221260 % arising from asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry breaking [19] due to the overlapping of spatial wavefunctions is taken into account, as\ndiscussed above. This should be done because the VMD\nhypothesis with the SUf (4) symmetric V P V \u2032 couplings\nagain overestimates the rates for the radiative decays of\ncharm mesons, here by \u223c 40 \u2212 60 %. The latter is consistent with \u0393(D\u22170 \u2192 D0 \u03b3)exp < 800 keV [16]. The\nlarge difference between the above two rates results from\nthe fact that the contributions of the \u03c10 , \u03c9 and \u03c8 meson poles interfere constructively in the latter decay and\ndestructively in the former.\nNow we are in a position to consider the Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3\ndecay. We compare the result with that for Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0\nlater. The amplitude is given by \u03c6 and \u03c8-meson\npoles.\n\u221a\nUsing the\u221aSUf (4) symmetry relations, 2A(Ds\u2217+ \u2192\nDs+ \u03c6) = 2A(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c8) = A(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c10 ), and\nEq. (8), we obtain a small rate,\n\u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3) \u223c 0.8 keV,\n\n(9)\n\nbecause of the destructive interference between the \u03c6\nand \u03c8 pole amplitudes. However, this result satisfies the experimental constraint, \u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3)exp <\n1.8 MeV [16].\nSimilarly, the amplitude for the radiative decay of the\nscalar meson S \u2192 V \u03b3 can be written in the form\nM (S \u2192 V \u03b3) = G\u03bc\u03bd (V )F \u03bc\u03bd (\u03b3)A(S \u2192 V \u03b3),\n\n(10)\n\n\u2217+\nwhere S = F\u0302I+ , F\u03020+ or Ds0\n. Under the VMD hypothesis,\nthe above A(S \u2192 V \u03b3) is given by\n\"\n#\nX\nXV \u2032 (0)\nA(S \u2192 V V \u2032 ).\nA(S \u2192 V \u03b3) \u2243\n2\nm\n\u2032\nV\n\u2032\n0\nV =\u03c1 , \u03c9, \u03c6, \u03c8\n\n(11)\n\nThe SUf (4) relations relevant to A(S \u2192 V V \u2032 ) are\nA(F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03c10 ) = A(F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03c9)\n\n= A(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b4\u0302 s0 \u03c10 )\u03b2 \u2032 ,\n\u2217+\n\u2217+\n2A(Ds0\n\u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03c6) = 2A(Ds0\n\u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03c8)\n= A(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c8\u03c8),\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2032 denotes a suppression factor (like \u03b2 used above)\narising from the overlapping of the color and spin wave\nfunctions. We again assume that the system under consideration is not very far from the limiting case, i.e., that\nof full suppression for A(F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03c10 ) and no suppression for A(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b4\u0302 s0 \u03c10 ) (the so-called fall-apart decay). However, the two pairs of quarks {q q\u0304} are now\ncolorless vector states, i.e., |\u03b2 \u2032 |2 \u2243 14 from the crossing\nmatrices for color and spin [13]. For (i) S = F\u0302I+ , (ii)\n\u2217+\nS = F\u03020+ and (iii) S = Ds0\n, the amplitude A(S \u2192 V \u03b3)\n0\nis dominated by (i) \u03c1 , (ii) \u03c9, and (iii) \u03c6 and \u03c8 poles,\nrespectively, because of the OZI rule. The input data\nare |A(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b4\u0302 s0 \u03c10 )| \u2243 0.020 MeV\u22121 , obtained from\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b3)exp = 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 keV [16], for (i) and\n(ii), and |A(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c8\u03c8)| \u2243 0.0823 MeV\u22121 , obtained from\n\u0393(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c8\u03b3)exp = 119 \u00b1 15 keV [16], for (iii). Inserting\nEqs. (11) and (12) or Eqs. (11) and (13) into the amplitude, Eq. (10), and taking the values of the quantities\nXV (0) listed above, we estimate the rates for the radiative decays of the scalar mesons listed in Table I. The\nrate for F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3 is smaller by an order of magnitude than that for F\u0302I+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3, because of the relation\n3X\u03c9 (0) \u2243 X\u03c1 (0).\nTable I.

(1), as expected.\nIn the above, we have studied the radiative decays\nof F\u0302I+ and F\u03020+ by taking only \u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b3)exp =\n0.32 \u00b1 0.03 keV as the input data, although another radiative decay, \u03c6 \u2192 f0 (980)\u03b3, has also been measured.\nThe reason for this is that the latter is apparently more\nuncertain than the former. If the measured rate [16]\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 (980)\u03b3)exp = 1.87 \u00b1 0.09 keV were taken as the\ninput data, the rate for the f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 under the VMD\nhypothesis would be given by \u0393(f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)V MD \u2243 15\nkeV, which is much larger than \u0393(f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)exp =\n0.39+0.10\n\u22120.13 keV [16]. Also, the ratio RF\u0302I would be obtained as RF\u0302I \u223c 0.2 in the same way as in Eq. (14).\nThis implies that the electromagnetic interaction would\nnot be very much weaker than in the case of ordinary\nstrong interactions, and thus it leads to an unnatural\nresult. The above would imply that the input data\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 (980)\u03b3)exp is too large. By contrast, if we take\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b3)exp, as before, we can accurately reproduce the above \u0393(f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)exp .\n\n\f4\nNext, we discuss isospin non-conserving decays. The\namplitude for Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 is approximately given by\n!\nm2Ds\u2217 \u2212 m2Ds\n\u2217+\n+ 0\nM (Ds \u2192 Ds \u03c0 ) \u2243\nhDs+ |A\u03c00 |Ds\u2217+ i,\nf\u03c0 0\n(15)\nas in Eq. (3). Here we have assumed that the violation\nof isospin conservation is caused by the \u03b7-\u03c0 0 mixing, i.e.,\nA\u03c00 \u2192 A\u03c00 + \u01ebA\u03b7 , (|\u01eb| \u226a 1), and therefore we replace\nhDs+ |A\u03c00 |Ds\u2217+ i by \u01ebhDs+ |A\u03b7 |Ds\u2217+ i. The axial charge A\u03b7 is\ngiven by A\u03b7 = cos \u0398*A\u03b7n \u2212sin \u0398*A\u03b7s , where A\u03b7n and A\u03b7s\nare the {nn\u0304} and {ss\u0304} components of A\u03b7 , respectively.\nIn the asymptotic matrix element of A\u03b7 , only the matrix\nelement of A\u03b7s can survive, due to the OZI rule, and the\nasymptotic SUf (4) symmetry leads to hDs+ |A\u03b7s |Ds\u2217+ i =\n1\n+\n0\n+\n2 h\u03c0 |A\u03c0 |\u03c1 i. Therefore, it follows that\n2hDs+ |A\u03c00 |Ds\u2217+ i\n\n+\n\n0\n\n= \u2212\u01eb sin \u0398 * h\u03c0 |A\u03c0+ |\u03c1 i.\n\n(16)\n\nThe size of h\u03c0 + |A\u03c0+ |\u03c10 i can be estimated as\n|h\u03c0 + |A\u03c0+ |\u03c10 i| \u2243 1.0 [20] from the measured rate,\n\u0393(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0)exp \u2243 150 MeV [16]. Inserting Eq. (16) with\n\u0398 \u2243 35\u25e6 (\u03b8P \u2243 \u221220\u25e6 ), as before, into Eq. (15) and using\nthe measured branching ratios for the Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 and\nDs\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3 decays [16], we get\n|\u01eb| \u223c 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere we have used Eq. (9). This value of |\u01eb| is consistent\nwith the result given in Ref. [23] and with the secondorder effect of QED, as argued qualitatively above.\nWith the help of the above value of |\u01eb|, we finally\nconsider two cases of the isospin non-conserving decay,\n+\n+\nDs0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 : (a) assuming Ds0\n(2317) is the\n+\nscalar four-quark F\u03020 \u223c [cn][s\u0304n\u0304]I=0 , and (b) assuming\n+\n\u2217+\nDs0\n(2317) is the conventional scalar Ds0\n\u223c {cs\u0304}. The\n+\n\u2217+\n+\namplitude for the S (= F\u03020 or Ds0 ) \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 decay can\nbe approximated as\n!\nm2S \u2212 m2Ds\n+\n+ 0\nhDs+ |A\u03c00 |S + i, (18)\nM (S \u2192 Ds \u03c0 ) \u2243\nf\u03c0 0\nas in Eq. (3). Because such a decay is assumed to proceed\nthrough the \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing, as discussed above, we replace\n\u2217+\nthe matrix elements hDs+ |A\u03c00 |F\u03020+ i and hDs+ |A\u03c00 |Ds0\ni by\n+\nthe OZI-allowed matrix elements \u01eb cos \u0398 * hDs |A\u03b7n |F\u03020+ i\n\u2217+\nand \u2212\u01eb sin \u0398 * hDs+ |A\u03b7s |Ds0\ni, respectively.\nIn the case (a), the modified asymptotic SUf (4)\nsymmetry leads to 2hDs+ |A\u03b7n |F\u03020+ i = h\u03c0 + |A\u03b7s |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i\u03b2.\n\u221a\n1\nand | 2h\u03c0 + |A\u03b7s |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i| =\nThen, taking |\u03b2|2 \u2243 12\n|h\u03b7 s |A\u03c0\u2212 |\u03b4\u0302 s+ i| \u223c 0.8, estimated above, we obtain\n\u0393(F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 ) \u223c 0.7 keV,\n\n(19)\n\nwhich is again smaller than \u0393(F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3) \u2243 4.7 keV,\nlisted in Table I. However, the ratio of the decay rates,\nRF\u03020 \u2261\n\n\u0393(F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3)\n\n\u0393(F\u03020+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 )\n\n\u223c 7,\n\n(20)\n\nis still much larger than the experimental upper bound\nappearing in Eq. (1), although it is much smaller than\nthat conjectured intuitively. This is because the radiative\nF\u03020+ \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3 decay is suppressed due to the small \u03b3\u03c9\ncoupling.\nIn the case (b), the asymptotic SUf (4) symmetry leads\n\u2217+\nto hDs+ |A\u03b7s |Ds0\ni = hK + |A\u03c0+ |K0\u22170 i. The size of the\nright-hand side is estimated to be |hK + |A\u03c0+ |K0\u22170 i| \u2243\n0.29 from the experimental result \u0393(K0\u22170 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )exp =\n182 \u00b1 24 MeV [16]. Here we have assumed that K0\u2217 (1430)\nis the conventional 3 P0 {ds\u0304} state [16]. Using the above\nresult for the asymptotic matrix elements, the value of\n|\u01eb| in Eq. (17), and \u03b8P = \u221220\u25e6 , we have\n\u2217+\n\u0393(Ds0\n\u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 ) \u223c 0.6 keV,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is much smaller than the other estimates [11, 12,\n25, 26, 27, 32]. In this case, the ratio of the rate for\nthe radiative decay (listed in Table I) to the isospin nonconserving rate is given by\n\u2217 \u2261\nRDs0\n\n\u2217+\n\u0393(Ds0\n\u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3)\n\u223c 60,\n\u2217 \u2192 D+ \u03c00 )\n\u0393(Ds0\ns\n\n(22)\n\nas conjectured intuitively. This value is again much larger\nthan the experimental upper limit given in Eq. (1). It is\n\u2217\nin Eqs. (20) and (22)\nquite natural that RF\u03020 and RDs0\nare much larger than unity, as the rates for isospin nonconserving decays are proportional to |\u01eb|2 = O(\u03b12 ), as\ndiscussed above, while those for the radiative decays are\nproportional to \u03b1, where \u03b1 denotes the fine structure\nconstant.\nWe now discuss other models [11, 12, 25, 26, 27], in\n+\nwhich Ds0\n(2317) has been assigned to the chiral partner of Ds+ (or 3 P0 {cs\u0304}). Although those models pre\u2217\nthan our\ndict much smaller values of the ratio RDs0\nresult, given in Eq. (22), most of them are still larger\nthan the experimental upper bound given in Eq. (1).\n\u2217\nIn Ref. [27], for example, the small ratio RDs0\n\u2243 0.08\nis obtained. This is quite near the experimental upper\nbound appearing in Eq. (1), but it is still a little larger.\n\u2217\nIn this model, the estimated rate for the Ds0\n\u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0\n\u2217\n+ 0\ndecay is \u0393(Ds0 \u2192 Ds \u03c0 )BEH \u2243 21.5 keV, which is\nconsiderably larger than the other estimates (\u223c 5 \u2212 10\nkeV) [11, 12, 25, 32]. If the value of the unknown parameter needed to obtain this rate is employed, the width of\n\u2217\nis predicted\nthe non-strange partner, D0\u2217 \u223c {cn\u0304}, of Ds0\nto be around 500 MeV [27]. However, this value is much\nlarger than the measured widths (\u223c 240 \u2212 280 MeV) of\nthe broad bumps that have been observed in the D0 \u03c0 +\nand D+ \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distributions [33, 34] and have\nbeen interpreted as peaks arising from the scalar resonances D0\u2217 . In addition, the widths of the resonances D0\u2217\nmight be narrower. Specifically, the argument [19] has\nbeen given that these bumps have a structure containing\ntwo scalar resonances; one is the conventional D0\u2217 with a\nwidth \u223c 50 \u2212 90 MeV, and the other is the four-quark\n \u0304 with a width \u223c 7 \u2212 15 MeV. Therefore, the\nD\u0302 \u223c [cn][\u016bd]\n\u2217\nvalue \u0393(Ds0 \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 ) \u2243 21.5 keV seems to be too large.\n\n\f5\n\u2217+\nFor the radiative Ds0\n\u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3 decay, the model [27]\n\u2217+\n\u2217+\npredicts \u0393(Ds0 \u2192 Ds \u03b3)BEH \u2243 1.74 keV, which is not\nvery far from the other predictions [11, 12, 25, 26]. In\nthe model, however, the rate for the radiative decay is\nvery sensitive to the assumed values of the constituent\nquark masses. The above small rate has been obtained\nby choosing mc \u2243 3ms , which is very far from the picture\nof the heavy charm quark. In addition, there is an argument based on a semi-relativistic potential model [35]\nthat mc \u2243 1.4 \u2212 1.5 GeV and ms \u2243 0.090 \u2212 0.095 GeV\nnear the scale of the charm meson mass under consideration. Such a small value of ms might be supported by\nrecent lattice QCD analyses [36]. Moreover, the model\npredicts\n\n\u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 )\n\u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3)\n\nBEH\n\n\u2243 0.018,\n\n(23)\n\n\u2217+\nin the case that parameter values yielding \u0393(Ds0\n\u2192\n\u2217+\nDs \u03b3)BEH \u2243 1.74 keV are used. The above ratio is much\nsmaller than the the well-known experimental value [16],\n\n\u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 )\n\u0393(Ds\u2217+ \u2192 Ds+ \u03b3)\n\nexp\n\n= 0.062 \u00b1 0.026.\n\n(24)\n\nThe model studied in Ref. [26] predicts a small rate for\n\u2217+\nthe Ds0\n\u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3 decay that is consistent with the result\ndiscussed above. It also predicts a large rate,\n\u2217+\n\u0393(Ds0\n\u2192 Ds+ \u03c0 0 ) \u2243 129 keV,\n\n(25)\n\nin the case that a large value is used for the isospin violating parameter, \u01ebAG \u2243 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 , which has been estimated by using the measured branching ratios for the\nOZI violating decays [16], B(J/\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8(1S)\u03c0 0 ) =\n(9.6 \u00b1 2.1) \u00d7 10\u22124 and B(J/\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8(1S)\u03b7) =\n(3.17 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10\u22122 . As a consequence, a small ratio,\n\u2217 \u2264 0.015, which satisfies Eq. (1) has been obtained.\nRDs0\nHowever, the above value of \u01ebAG is much larger than the\nvalue of |\u01eb| that we estimated from the measured ratio\nin Eq. (24). This seems to imply that the mechanism of\nthe isospin violation discussed above is different from the\nusual \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing. For this reason, the model studied in\nRef. [26] cannot reproduce Eq. (24). We conclude that it\nis difficult to satisfy the experimental constraint given in\nEq. (1) while simultaneously realizing consistency with\n+\nthe well-known ratio Eq. (24) if Ds0\n(2317) is assigned to\nan I = 0 state.\n+\nIn summary, we have studied the Ds0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds\u2217+ \u03b3\n+\n+ 0\nand Ds0 (2317) \u2192 Ds \u03c0 decays using the VMD hypothesis, the hard pion technique in the IMF, and the\n(asymptotic) SUf (4). We used the measured rates of\n\n[1] B. Aubert et al. (the BABAR Collaboration), Phys.\nRev. Lett. 90 (2003), 242001.\n\n\u0393(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c8\u03b3)exp and \u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 (980)\u03b3)exp as the input data, although the assignment of a0 (980) to the isotriplet four-quark meson, \u03b4\u0302 s , has not yet been confirmed;\ni.e., it might contain some other configuration, like a K K\u0304\nmolecule [37]. We have also checked ambiguities arising\nfrom the above approximations by comparing our results\nfor D\u2217 \u2192 D\u03b3 (and D\u2217 \u2192 D\u03c0 in Ref. [19]) with existing experimental data. In this way, we have observed\n+\nthe followings. (i) The assignment of Ds0\n(2317) to the\n+\niso-triplet four-quark meson, F\u0302I \u223c [cn][s\u0304n\u0304]I=1 , is consistent with the experimental constraint, Eq. (1), as seen\nin Eq. (14). (ii) It is difficult to reconcile the assign+\nment of Ds0\n(2317) to an iso-singlet meson (the four-quark\n+\n\u2217+\nF\u03020 or the conventional Ds0\n) with Eqs. (1) and (24) simultaneously. This is quite natural, because the rates\nfor the isospin non-conserving decays are proportional to\n|\u01eb|2 = O(\u03b12 ), while those for the radiative decays are\nproportional to \u03b1, the fine structure constant. Thus, it is\n+\nseen that the assignment of Ds0\n(2317) to F\u0302I+ is most reasonable. In addition, this assignment is compatible with\nthe observation that the estimated branching fraction for\n+\nB \u2192 D\u0304DsJ\nwould be consistent with the measured value\n+\nif the DsJ are interpreted as four-quark mesons, while\nit would be much larger than the measured one if the\n+\nDsJ\nare interpreted as the conventional {cs\u0304} [10]. The\nremaining problem is that neutral and doubly charged\npartners of F\u0302I+ have not yet been observed [9]. To solve\nthis problem, we need to know the production mechanism\nof the F\u0302I0,+,++ mesons. Determining this mechanism is\nleft as a future project. (iii) Finally, the numerical results obtained in this work should not be interpreted too\nstrictly, because our theoretical framework may result in\na total overestimate of \u223c 40 \u2212 60 % in the rate. Even\nconsidering this ambiguity, however, the conclusion of\nthe present work is not changed.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank K. Abe and K.
