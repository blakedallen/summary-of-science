LEPS collaboration reported evidence of the \u0398+ pentaquark with S = +1, B = +1 and the minimum quark content uudds\u0304\n[1]. Such a state is clearly beyond the conventional quark model if it is established by future experiments. A recent\nreview of pentaquarks can be found in Ref. [2].\nBABAR, CLEO and BELLE collaborations observed two narrow charm-strange mesons DsJ (2317), DsJ (2457) below\nthreshold [3]. These states are 160 MeV below quark model predictions. Some authors speculate they are four-quark\nstates [4, 5]. These states may admit a small portion of DK or D\u2217 K continuum contribution in their wave functions.\nBut the dominant component of DsJ (2317), DsJ (2457) should be cs\u0304 [6]. This topic is reviewed in Ref. [7].\nBELLE collaboration discovered a new narrow charmonium-like state X(3872) in the J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel [8]. Its\nmass is very close to DD\u0304\u2217 threshold. Its production rate is comparable to those of other excited charmonium states.\nVery recently BELLE collaboration observed the same signal in the J/\u03c8 \u03c9 channel [9]. Its mass and decay pattern\nseems to favor its interpretation as a deuteron-like DD\u0304\u2217 molecule [10]. Naively, one would expect the lower production\nrate for DD\u0304\u2217 molecules.\nThis year SELEX collaboration reported a narrow state DsJ (2632) above threshold [11]. Its dominant decay mode\nis Ds \u03b7. Such an anomalous decay pattern strongly indicates DsJ (2632) is a four quark state in the SU (3)F 15\n1\nrepresentation with the quark content 2\u221a\n(dsd \u0304 + sdd \u0304 + su\u016b + us\u016b \u2212 2sss\u0304)c\u0304 [12]. Other possible interpretations were\n2\ndiscussed in Refs. [13].\nIn the light meson sector, f0 (980)/a0(980) lies 10 MeV below the K + K \u2212 threshold. It's difficult to find a suitable\nposition for them within the framework of quark model. So they were postulated to be candidates of kaon molecule\nor four quark states. Recently there has accumulated some evidence of the four-quark interpretation of the low lying\nscalar mesons from lattice QCD calculation [14, 15].\nThe study of multiquark states started nearly three decades ago in the MIT bag model [16, 17]. The reaction\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 was suggested in the search of q q\u0304q q\u0304 resonances. Later ARGUS collaboration found evidence of a four-quark\nstate in the dominant partial wave J P Jz = 2+ 2 in the reaction \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 \u2192 4\u03c0 [18]. Now the observed signal was\nnamed as X(1600 \u00b1 100) with the quantum numbers J P C I G = 2++ 2+ [19].\nIn this work, we employ QCD finite energy sum rules (FESR) to explore whether there exists a resonance in the\nJ P C I G = 2++ 2+ channel.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: zhusl@th.phy.pku.edu.cn\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nQCD sum rule approach has proven useful in extracting the masses of the ground state hadrons [20]. QSR approach\ncan yield the absolute mass scale as the lattice QCD formalism. First one starts from the correlation function composed\nof the interpolating current which strongly couples to the hadron which one wants to study. The correlation function\ncan be calculated using the operator product expansion (OPE) technique. As one approaches the resonance region\nfrom large Q2 , the nonperturbative power corrections become important gradually. One gets the spectral density of\nthe correlation function in terms of quark and gluon condensates at the quark level. The hadron mass enters the\nspectral density of the correlation function at the hadron level. With the quark hadron duality assumption, one can\nextract the hadron mass.\nThe construction of a suitable interpolating current is crucial. There are only two independent color structures\nfor a tetraquark. Let's first focus on a pair of q q\u0304. Since 3\u0304c \u00d7 3c = 1c + 8c , there are only two ways to form a color\nsinglet tetraquark from two pairs of q\u0304q. Both pairs are either in the color-singlet or color-octet state simultaneously.\nWe denote the corresponding interpolating currents as \u03b7 1 , \u03b7 8 . If we focus on the two quarks, 3c \u00d7 3c = 3\u0304c + 6c .\nThe anti-quark pair must be in either 3c or 6\u0304c color state in order to get a color-singlet tetraquark. We denote the\ncorresponding interpolating currents as \u03b7 3\u0304 , \u03b7 6 . It's important to note that \u03b7 3\u0304 , \u03b7 6 are linear combinations of \u03b7 1 , \u03b7 8 . We\nrefer the reader to the appendix for details.\nWe use a general interpolating current for X(1600) which is the linear combination of \u03b7 3\u0304 and \u03b7 6 .\n6\n3\u0304\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n+ Y \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n= (Y + 1)d \u0304l (x)\u03b3\u03bc ul (x)d \u0304m (x)\u03b3\u03bd um (x) + (Y \u2212 1)d \u0304l (x)\u03b3\u03bc um (x)d \u0304m (x)\u03b3\u03bd ul (x) + (g\u03bc\u03bd terms)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Y = a + bi is a complex number. a and b are real numbers.

The dimension of the interpolating currents of the conventional hadrons\nlike rho and nucleon is not high. Both BSR and FESR yield roughly the same results. If the interpolating current is of\nhigh dimension, the working window of MB does not exist sometimes. In this case, FESR may have some advantage\nover BSR [25].\nWith the spectral density, the nth moment of FESR is defined as\nZ s0\ndssn \u03c1(s)\n(13)\nW (n, s0 ) =\n0\n\nwhere n \u2265 0. With the quark hadron duality assumption we get the finite energy sum rule\nW (n, s0 )|Hadron = W (n, s0 )|QCD .\n\n(14)\n\n\f4\nThe mass can be obtained as\nM2 =\n\nW (n + 1, s0 )\n.\nW (n, s0 )\n\n(15)\n\nIn principle, one can extract the threshold self-consistently from the requirement that the hadron mass has the\n2\nleast dependence on s0 , i.e., dM\nds0 = 0. However, the threshold value s0 extracted this way is not necessarily physical\n2\n\nsometimes. The weight function of FESR enhances the continuum part even more than the weight function e\u2212s/MB\nin the Borel sum rule. One must make sure that only the lowest pole contributes to the FESR below s0 . Otherwise\nthe result will be very misleading. To be more specific, a naive stability region in s0 is no guarantee of a physically\nreasonable value for s0 . For example, the FESR with an extracted threshold s0 \u2248 10 GeV2 is certainly irrelevant for\nthe possible X(1600) state.\nBesides the weak dependence on s0 , we also require (1) the zeroth moment W (0, s0 ) > 0 and (2) the convergence\nof the operator product expansion (OPE). Higher dimension condensates should be suppressed in order to ensure\na reliable FESR based on the converging OPE series. This convergence requirement is not easily satisfied if the\ninterpolating current is of high dimension. As shown in the appendix, neither \u03b7 3\u0304 nor \u03b7 6 leads to a converging FESR\nfor a reasonable value of s0 . Only with a mixed current which is the linear combination of \u03b7 3\u0304 and \u03b7 6 , can we make\nthe OPE series of FESR converging.\nWe use the following values of condensates: hq\u0304qi = \u2212(0.24GeV)3 , hgs2 GGi = (0.48 \u00b1 0.14)GeV4 , hgs q\u0304\u03c3Gqi = \u2212m20 \u00d7\nhq\u0304qi, m20 = (0.8 \u00b1 0.2)GeV2 . To simply numerical analysis, we introduce variables \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 which are defined as:\na2 + b 2 =\na=\u2212\n\n5\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\n2\n\n1\n(1 + \u01eb2 ) .\n12\n\np\nThey satisfy two constraints: \u01eb1 \u2264 1, |1 + \u01eb2 | \u2264 6 10(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ). Now the spectral density reads\n\u03c1(s) =\n\n1\n1\n(8 \u2212 5\u01eb1 )s4 \u2212 15\n(216 \u2212 115\u01eb1 + 7\u01eb2 + 7)s2 hgs2 GGi\n6\n* 21 * \u03c0\n2 * 15 * \u03c0 6\n5\n1\n2\n+\n\u01eb1 shq\u0304qi +\n(65\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )hq\u0304qihgs q\u0304\u03c3Gqi .\n2\n18 * \u03c0\n288 * \u03c0 2\n212\n\n(16)\n\nFrom Eq. (16) it's clear that we can adjust the variables \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 to suppress D = 6, 8 condensates. In fact there exists\na parameter space of (\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 ), with which there exists a stable FESR plateau in the MX vs s0 curve. The extracted\ns0 at the stable plateau is physically reasonable. With this s0 the zeroth FESR moment is positive. and the OPE is\nconvergent. One typical set of these variables is \u01eb1 = \u22120.02, \u01eb2 = \u22122. After we divide each piece in the FESR by the\nperturbative term, the zeroth moment reads\nW (0, s0 ) \u223c 1 \u2212\n\n3.53 2.79 1.95\n\u2212 3 \u2212 4 .\ns20\ns0\ns0\n\n(17)\n\nThe positivity requirement leads to s0 > 2.3 GeV2 .\nFor s0 > 2.3 GeV2 , the OPE also converges well. The variation of MX with s0 is presented in Figure 2. The\nextracted mass is\nMX = (1.65 \u00b1 0.15)GeV .\n\n(18)\n\nAs can be seen from Figure 2, the value of MX does not change much if we truncate the OPE at D = 6. This is\nanother sign of convergence of our FESR.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe state X(1600) with J P C I G = 2++ 2+ has inspired many theoretical papers [26]. The potential scattering of\n\u03c1 \u03c1 via the \u03c3 meson exchange was proposed to explain the signal in Ref. [27]. In the diquark cluster model [28], the\nmass and decay width of X(1600) is studied together with other tetraquarks assuming the 3\u0304c color wave function for\ntwo quarks. Using the potential model X(1600) mass was estimated to be 1544 MeV recently [29].\nIn this work we have investigated this state using QCD finite energy sum rule. With any single current \u03b7 1 , \u03b7 8 , \u03b7 3\u0304 ,\n6\n\u03b7 , the operator product expansion of the corresponding correlator does not converge. After we consider the linear\n0 0\n\n\f5\nM\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\ns_0\n\nFIG. 2: The variation of the mass M with the threshold s0 (in unit of GeV2 ) for the current (1). The long-dashed and solid\ncurves correspond to FESR when truncated at dimension D = 6 and D = 8 respectively.\n\ncombination of \u03b7 3\u0304 and \u03b7 6 , we have derived a converging FESR and observe a resonance signal at 1.65 GeV, which\nis close to the experimentally observed X(1600) state. Our analysis indicates both the \"hidden color\" and coupled\nchannel effects may be important in the multiquark system.\nFrom charge, angular momentum, parity, isospin, C parity, and G parity conservation, we may obtain the allowed decay modes of X(1600). G parity requires even number of pions in the final state for pure pion final states. For example,\nX 0 (1600) \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 0 , \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is forbidden by G parity. C parity forbids X 0 (1600) \u2192 \u03c9(3\u03c0 0 ). Isospin conservation forbids\nthe following decay modes: X 0 (1600) \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 , \u03c9\u03c9. The possible modes are X 0 (1600) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , 4\u03c0, \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 , \u03c10 \u03c10 .\nAngular momentum conservation requires D-wave decay for the two pion mode. Therefore, two pion decay modes\nmay be suppressed compared with S-wave \u03c1\u03c1 mode.\nFilippi et al. reported the possible existence of the J P C I G = 0++ 2+ state decaying into \u03c0 + \u03c0 + in the reaction\nn\u0304p \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [30]. One the other hand, some constraint has been obtained on the possible resonance in the scalar\nisotensor channel from the phase shift analysis of \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering [31]. Constraint on the D-wave I=2\nresonance from the similar analysis of the same reactions will be very desirable.\nThe process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 \u2192 X(1600) \u2192 4\u03c0 was suggested and used in the search of X(1600). We suggest the following\nreactions to look for this charming state.\n\u2022 J/\u03c8 decays at BES, CLEO and \u03a5 decays at BELLE, BABAR\nSymmetry considerations requires X(1600) is produced together with odd number of pions in J/\u03c8 decays. One\npion mode is forbidden by isospin conservation. So the favorable decay chain is J/\u03c8 \u2192 X(1600) + 3\u03c0 \u2192\n2\u03c1 + 3\u03c0 \u2192 7\u03c0. There is also some chance in J/\u03c8 \u2192 X(1600) + 3\u03c0 \u2192 2\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 \u2192 5\u03c0.\n\u2022 Hadron reactions especially charge exchange processes\nCharge exchange processes are useful for the production of X ++ (1600) if such a state exists. Some of them are\n\u03c0 + N \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 + X ++ (1600) + N \u2192 5\u03c0 + N , p + N \u2192 n + N \u2032 + X ++ (1600) where N is either a nucleon or nuclei.\nThe later process can be studied at CSR facility at Lan Zhou.\n\u2022 Anti-proton annihilation on the proton or deuteron targets\nLet's take X(1600) production from anti-proton annihilation on the proton target as an example. Since the\nisospin of pp\u0304 is either 0 or 1, X(1600) should be accompanied by one or several pions. However, kinematics\nallows only one pion decay mode: p\u0304 + p \u2192 X(1600) + \u03c0 0 \u2192 5\u03c0. So we get Cpp\u0304 = (\u2212)Lpp\u0304 +Spp\u0304 = +, Ipp\u0304 = 1.\n(1) When the pp\u0304 pair is in the S-wave, Lpp\u0304 = Spp\u0304 = Jpp\u0304 = 0, Ppp\u0304 = \u2212. Angular momentum and parity\nconservation requires L\u03c0X(1600) = 2; (2) When the pp\u0304 pair is in the P-wave, Lpp\u0304 = Spp\u0304 = 1, Ppp\u0304 = +, Jpp\u0304 = 1 or\n2. We get L\u03c0X(1600) = 1; (3) When the pp\u0304 pair is in the D-wave, Lpp\u0304 = 2, Spp\u0304 = 0, Jpp\u0304 = 2, Ppp\u0304 = \u2212. We have\nL\u03c0X(1600) = 0.\nAcknowledgments\n\nS.L.Z. thanks B.-S. Zou and H.-Q. Zheng for helpful discussions.
