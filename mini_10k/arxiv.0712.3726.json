On the one hand, it is possible to preserve the metric structure of Einsteinian space\ntime and to generalize the gravitational Lagrangian by replacing the Ricci scalar with a function of it. As a result, modified gravity can be shown to be equivalent to a scalar-tensor\nscheme, i.e., to a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, via a suitable conformal transformation. On the other hand, non-Riemannian geometry can be taken into account: in the\nmost general setting, an asymmetric metric tensor, torsion and non-metricity tensor arise.\nThese objects lead to a modification of the gravitational Lagrangian, and their coupling\nwith spinors can be analyzed.\nIn this paper we will address both points of view.\nIn the second section, we will analyze the implications of some relevant examples in modified\ngravity and the corresponding scalar-tensor model. In fact, the analysis of an exponential\naction for the gravitational field will outline the puzzle of vacuum energy, while the investigation of a gravitational Lagrangian consisting of positive and negative powers of the Ricci\nscalar will illustrate how such modified-gravity theories can mimic the effect of dark energy.\nOn the converse, we will also investigate the Newtonian limit of some potentials, whose\nscalar-tensor description is explicitly solvable with respect to the first derivative.\nIn the third section, we will examine an extended Shouten classification of non-Riemannian\ngeometries: the curvature tensor will be shown to decouple into a Riemannian part plus\nother contributions, and autoparallel trajectories will be evaluated at first-order approximation. The coupling between spinors and non-Riemannian objects will also be considered in\nthe case of a symmetric metric, where torsion and non-metricity are taken into account.\nBrief concluding remarks follow.\n\nII.\n\nMODIFIED GRAVITY\n\nWithin the framework of modified gravity, when the Ricci scalar R is replaced with a\ngeneric function f (R), the new gravitational action, in the Jordan frame, reads\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nSG = 2 d4 x \u2212gf (R)\nk\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhose variation with respect to g \u03bc\u03bd yields generalized Einstein equations. After introducing\ntwo Lagrange multipliers and eliminating one of them, (1) rewrites\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS = 2 d4 x \u2212g [f \u2032 (A)(R \u2212 A) + f (A)] ,\nk\n\n(2)\n\nwith R = A. By means of the conformal transformation\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 e\u03c6 g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nand for the particular (on shell) choice\n\np\n\n3/2\u03c6 = \u2212 ln f \u2032 (A), (2) is mapped into the action\n\nof scalar field in curved space time minimally coupled to gravity [1], whose evolution, under\nthe on-shell condition, is given by the potential V (\u03c6)\nV (\u03c6) =\n\nA\nf \u2032 (A)\n\n\u2212\n\nf (A)\n.\nf \u2032 (A)2\n\n(4)\n\nAccording to the choice of the function f (R), different features of the modern universe can\nbe explained. In fact, many open problems at different scales seem to be solved without\nintroducing dark energy or dark matter [2]. Constraints on the free parameters of such\ntheories [3] can be imposed on the basis of solar-system data, binary-pulsar tests and cosmological observations [4].\nIn particular, a crucial role is played by the value of f (0): if this value is non-vanishing, a\nvacuum-energy cancellation mechanism has to hypothesized. The analysis of an exponential\nfunction of the Ricci scalar[5], i.e., f (R) = \u03bbe\u03bcR , illustrates that the geometrical components\ncontain a cosmological term too, and the deSitter solution exists in presence of matter only\nfor a negative ratio between the vacuum-energy density and that of the intrinsic cosmological term \u01eb\u039b . A negative value of the intrinsic cosmological constant predicts an accelerating\ndeSitter dynamics, but, in this case, we would get a vacuum-energy density greater than\nthe modulus of the intrinsic term. The vacuum solution describes the full non-perturbative\nregime, from which the Einsteinian limit cannot be recovered, and the introduction of the\nexternal field can be interpreted as the role dark energy plays in the vacuum-energy cancellation mechanism. The corresponding scalar-tensor model consists of s scalar field minimally\ncoupled with gravity, evolving under a potential V (\u03c6) \u221d \u01eb\u039b e\u03c6 (\u03c6 + 1): if the sign of the\nintrinsic cosmological constant is reverted, this potential admits a minimum, around which\nfield equations can be linearized. The value \u03c60 that minimizes the potential does not correspond to the vacuum solution of the Jordan frame, but to the solution found in presence\n2\n\n\fof external matter. This achievement establishes an off-shell correspondence between the\ntwo frames, which supports the interpretation of such an unphysical external field with the\naction of dark energy in the vacuum-energy cancellation.\nThe class of functions f (R) = f0 Rn has been widely investigated[6], and can be considered\nas an eligible candidate to solve both dark-energy and dark-matter problems on cosmological\nand galactic scales, respectively. In the weak-field limit, the gravitational potential reads\n\"\n\u221a\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b2 #\nGm\nr\n12n2 \u2212 7n \u2212 1 \u2212 36n4 + 12n3 \u2212 83n2 + 50n + 1\n\u03a6(r) = \u2212\n1+\n, \u03b2=\n: (5)\n2r\nrc\n6n2 \u2212 4n + 2\nrc is an arbitrary parameter, depending on the typical scale of the considered system, while\n\u03b2 is a universal parameter. In particular, the Newtonian potential is recovered for n = 1\nand \u03b2 = 0, while \u03b2 \u2192 1 for n \u2192 \u221e. On the one hand, observational data on spiral-galaxy\nrotation curves are fitted, within this model, by n > 1, but, on the other hand, solar-system\ndata based on light-bending and planetary orbits [7] require \u03b2 \u223c 0, which is a very stringent\nconstraint1 .\n\nBy means of the conformal transformation (3), it is found that the class of functions f (R) =\nf0 Rn is mapped into a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, with an exponential potential\n[9], in absence of external matter. It is worth remarking that also inflationary scenarios are\noften realized by considering a scalar field with a particular potential, and the conformal\nequivalence (3) is the link between the two models.\nWe are now ready to go the other way round in order to investigate the expression of some\npotentials in the Jordan frame, by solving (4) for the unknown f (R). It is worth noting\nthat the condition f \u2032\u2032 6= 0 has to be imposed to keep results consistent from a mathematical\npoint of view; it automatically rules Einsteinian gravity (plus a cosmological constant) out\nof our investigation. (The condition f 6= 0 excludes trivial solutions).\n\nThe preliminary analysis of the simple case of a quadratic potential [10], V (\u03c6) = m\u03c62 ,\nrestricts the range of potentials that can be studied in this perspective. In fact, in this case,\n(4) reads\n3\nf \u2032 R \u2212 f = mf \u20322 (lg f \u2032 )2 :\n2\n1\n\n(6)\n\nAnyhow, it has been demonstrated [8] that the more general function f (R) = R \u2212\ncan pass solar-system tests after some fine tuning.\n\n3\n\nc\n(R\u2212\u039b1 )n\n\n+ b(R \u2212 \u039b2 )m\n\n\fdifferentiating with respect to R and introducing the auxiliary function f \u2032 = p, one obtains\nthe system\nR = 3m(lg p) (p + lg p) ,\n\u0010\np\u0011\n(2 lg p \u2212 1) + C,\nf = 3mp 1 +\n4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary integration constant. From this example, we can see that there is a\nlarge class of inflationary potentials [11], which can not be solved with respect to the first\nderivative explicitly, and are therefore unsuitable for our investigation. Other approaches\nwill be addressed elsewhere [12].\nHowever, the exponential case [9] offers a great variety of applications. For\nV (\u03c6) = \u03b1e\u2212\n\n\u221a3\n2\n\n\u03bb\u03c6\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\n(4) rewrites\n\u2032\n\nf \u2032 R \u2212 f = \u03b1f \u20322 e\u03bb lg f \u2261 \u03b1f \u2032q ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith q \u2261 \u03bb + 2: differentiating with respect to R, we find the general solution\nf=\n\n1\n(\u03b1q)\n\n1\nq\u22121\n\nq\n1\n1\nq \u2212 1 1+ q\u22121\nq \u2212 1 q\u22121\nR\nR\n+C =\n+ C,\n1\nq\n(\u03b1q) q\u22121 q\n\n(10)\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary integration constant: we recover the original potential only for\nC \u2261 0. This solution is consistent for q 6= 0 and q 6= 1, i.e., \u03bb 6= \u22122 and \u03bb 6= \u22121,\nrespectively. This solution is also consistent with the condition f \u2032\u2032 6= 0, as\n\nq\nq\u22121\n\n6= 1 \u2200q, and\n\na linear gravitational Lagrangian, excluded by construction, is not a general solution for (9).\nContrastingly, it's worth remarking that the special case \u03bb = 0, i.e., a constant potential\nV (\u03c6) = \u03b1, is provided by both a linear gravitational Lagrangian plus a cosmological constant\n[16], and f = R2 /(4\u03b1).\nFinally, the trivial case V (\u03c6) = 0, obtained for \u03b1 = 0 \u2200\u03bb, is provided only by a linear\ngravitational Lagrangian without a cosmological constant.\nWe can recover information about the cases \u03bb = \u22122, \u03bb = \u22121, C 6= 0 by studying the slightly\ndifferent class of potentials [14]\nV (\u03c6) = \u03b11 e\u2212\n\n\u221a3\n2\n\n\u03bb1 \u03c6\n\n+ \u03b12 e\u2212\n\n\u221a3\n2\n\n\u03bb2 \u03c6\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\n4\n\n\fPotential (11) is not in general solvable with respect to the first derivative explicitly, but\nadmits the formal solution\nR = \u03b11 (2 + \u03bb1 )p1+\u03bb1 + \u03b12 (2 + \u03bb2 )p1+\u03bb2 ,\nf = \u03b11 (1 + \u03bb1 )p2+\u03bb1 + \u03b12 (1 + \u03bb2 )p2+\u03bb2 + C,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, as above, C is an arbitrary integration constant, p \u2261 f \u2032 , and f \u2032\u2032 6= 0.\nSome particular cases admit nevertheless an explicit solution. In fact, for \u03bb2 = \u22122, we find\nf=\n\n1\n(\u03b11 r)\n\n1\nr\u22121\n\nr \u2212 1 1+ 1\nR r\u22121 + \u03b12 ,\nr\n\n(13)\n\nwhile, for \u03bb2 = \u22121, we obtain\nf=\n\n1\n(\u03b11 r)\n\n1\nr\u22121\n\n1\nr\u22121\n(R \u2212 \u03b12 )1+ r\u22121 ,\nr\n\n(14)\n\nwhere, as above, f \u2032\u2032 6= 0 and r \u2261 2 + \u03bb1 : r 6= 0 and r 6= 1, i.e., \u03bb1 6= \u22122 and \u03bb1 6= \u22121,\nrespectively.\nFor \u03bb1 = 0 of (11), (4) is not solvable explicitly, and, differently from the previous result, a\nlinear gravitational Lagrangian is not a solution.\nParticular cases of (11) can be analyzed.\nFor \u03bb1 = \u2212\u03bb2 = 2 \u2261 \u03bb, we find the solution f =\n1 \u2261 \u03bb, f =\n\n\u221a 1 2 (R\n3\u03b11 3\n\n3 4/3\n1\nR\n(4\u03b11 )1/3 4\n\n+ \u03b12 , while, for \u03bb1 = \u2212\u03bb2 =\n\n\u2212 \u03b12 )3/2 . For \u03b11 = \u03b12 \u2261 \u03b1, the hyperbolic-cosine potential [14] [15]is\n\nrecovered.\nThe Newtonian limit of such scenarios can be examined. In fact, for (8), the limit q \u2192 \u221e, i.e.,\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e, induces a vanishing potential, and solution (10) gives the proper limit, f \u221d R, i.e.,\na linear gravitational Lagrangian without a cosmological constant, which is also achieved\nby imposing \u03b1 \u2261 0 in (10). From a physical point of view, for \u03bb >> 1, (10) reduces to\n\nf (r) \u221d R1+\u01eb(\u03bb) , with \u01eb(\u03bb) = 1/(1 + \u03bb) << 1, and (8) becomes negligible for small values of\n\u03c6. Furthermore, as discussed above, there are two classes of functions that can reproduce a\nconstant potential, i.e., both a linear gravitational Lagrangian plus a cosmological constant\nand f = R2 /(4\u03b1). Anyhow, a quadratic gravitational Lagrangian can be shown to be\ninappropriate to fit solar-system data [7].\n\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nNON-RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY\n\nA generalized Schouten classification [17] can be constructed for the case of an asymmetric metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd = s\u03bc\u03bd + a\u03bc\u03bd , which splits into its symmetric and antisymmetric\npart, respectively. The corresponding connection \u03a0\u03b8\u03ba\u03bb is determined by the incompatibility\nbetween metric and connection.

In fact, in non-flat space\ntime, the ordinary derivative of \u03b3 \u03bc matrices does not vanish, i.e., \u2202\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd 6= 0, and a covariant\n\nderivative D\u03bc must be found, such that D\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd = 0. Such covariant derivatives are obtained\nby introducing the connection \u0393\u03bc , such that\nD\u03bc A = \u2207\u03bc A \u2212 [\u0393\u03bc , A]\n\n(21)\n\nwhere A is a generic object, \u2207\u03bc denotes the geometrical covariant derivative and \u0393\u03bc is the\nspin connection. If A is not a spinor, then [\u0393\u03bc , A] = 0 \u21d2 D\u03bc A = \u2207\u03bc A, while, for spinors,\n(21) specifies as\nD\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u0393\u03bc \u03c8, D\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 + \u03c8\u0393\u03bc .\n\n(22)\n\nIn curved space time, we have\n1\n1\n\u0393\u03bc = \u2212 \u03b3\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd = Rab\u03bc \u03a3ab , Rab\u03bc \u2261 Rabc ec\u03bc ,\n4\n2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03a3ab are the generators of the Lorentz group, ea\u03bc are bein vectors, and Rabc are the\nRicci coeficients. In presence of torsion, we find\n1\n1\n\u0393\u03bc = Rab\u03bc \u03a3ab \u2212 Cab\u03bc \u03a3ab ,\n2\n2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere Cab\u03bc is a suitable bein projection of the contortion tensor. For a possible interpretation of the introduction of torsion, see, for example, [18]. In presence of non-metricity,\nspin connection are investigated in [19], where it is established that the connection is antisymmetric in first two indices only for a metric-compatible affine connection, and projective\ninvariance of the spin connection allows for the introduction of gauge fields interacting with\nspinors.\n7\n\n\fIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have reviewed the two main research lines that allow for a generalization of Einsteinian gravity.\nWithin the framework of modified gravity, if the Ricci scalar is replaced by an arbitrary\nfunction of it, the new gravitational action can account for a wide range of phenomena that\nhave no clear modelization in Einsteinian gravity. In particular, observational data and\ntheoretical speculations can be reproduced without introducing dark energy. In fact, for an\nexponential gravitational action, a cancellation mechanism between the Plankian vacuum\nenergy and the intrinsic geometrical term, responsible for the actual value of the cosmological constant, is necessary in the perturbative regime. For positive and negative powers of\nthe Ricci scalar, the weak-field limit can be evaluated, and constraints on such functions\ncan be found. Since any modified gravitational model in the Jordan frame is conformally\nequivalent in the Einstein frame to a scalar field in curved space time, minimally coupled\nwith gravity and evolving under a given potential, particular scalar-field potentials can be\nanalyzed. The resultant differential equation has been solved for an exponential potential,\nand information for the cases excluded in such an approach has been recovered for particular\ncases of the sum of two exponential potentials. The Newtonian limit of these models has\nbeen discussed, according to the results found for solar-system data.\nWithin the framework of non-Riemannian geometries, asymmetric non-metric connections\nprovide a model that contains Riemannian gravity (general relativity with an appropriate Lagrangian) and extra fields as non-Riemannian (non-gravitational) effects. The inverse\nstructure matrix has been found in the case of small asymmetric metric in linear approximation. The analysis of autoparallel trajectories in the hypothesis of small asymmetric metric\nand linear approximation reveals that torsion and the non-metricity tensor contribute at this\napproximation order, while the metric-asymmetricity object provides a negligible contribution. The introduction of spinors within this kind of schemes in ruled by the introduction of\ncovariant derivatives that restore invariance of the Dirac equation, and room is left for the\nintroduction of non-gravitational interactions.\n\n[1] S.
