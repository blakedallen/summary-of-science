B ERLIND , G LENNYS R. FARRAR\nCenter For Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics\nNew York University, New York, NY 10003, USA\naberlind@cosmo.nyu.edu,farrar@physics.nyu.edu\nAbstract: We show that future Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray samples should be able to distinguish\nwhether the sources of UHECRs are hosted by galaxy clusters or ordinary galaxies, or whether the sources\nare uncorrelated with the large-scale structure of the universe. Moreover, this is true independently of\narrival direction uncertainty due to magnetic deflection or measurement error. The reason for this is the\nsimple property that the strength of large-scale clustering for extragalactic sources depends on their mass,\nwith more massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, clustering more strongly than lower mass objects,\nsuch as ordinary galaxies.\n\nIntroduction\nIdentifying the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic\nrays (UHECRs, here E > 1019 eV \u2261 10 EeV)\nis complicated by the deflection they presumably\nexperience in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic\nfields, as well as their relatively poor arrival direction determinations, typically \u223c 1\u25e6 . Arrival\ndirections of most UHECRs are thus not known\nwell enough to match their positions with specific astrophysical objects. However, there is also\nuseful information in the clustering of UHECRs\non large scales, where \u223c few degree uncertainties in position become unimportant. The clustering of galaxies in the universe is typically quantified by the two-point correlation function or its\nanalog in Fourier space, the power spectrum. The\ntwo-point correlation function \u03be(r) of any class of\nobjects (e.g., galaxies of a certain luminosity or\ncolor) is defined as the excess number of pairs of\nsuch objects at physical separation r over that expected for a random (Poisson) distribution. In Cold\nDark Matter models, the large-scale amplitude of\n\u03be(r) (usually referred to as the bias) of a population of objects depends only on their mass, with\nmore massive objects, such as clusters of galaxies, clustering more strongly than less massive objects, such as ordinary galaxies [5, 6, 1]. The largescale bias of a UHECR sample is therefore a robust\n\nand informative measure of the clustering properties of the source. We cannot measure physical\nseparations for pairs involving UHECRs because\nthey do not have measured redshifts. However,\nwe can measure the angular correlation function\n\u03c9(\u03b8). As is the case for \u03be(r), the large-scale amplitude of \u03c9(\u03b8) for a UHECR sample depends on\nthe nature of the astrophysical source. However, it\nalso depends on the depth of the sample because\ndeeper samples mix more physically uncorrelated\npairs and thus show weaker angular clustering. In\norder to access the information in the large-scale\nangular clustering of UHECRs, we must therefore\nknow the depth of our UHECR sample. In this paper, we demonstrate what can be learned from the\nlarge-scale angular clustering of UHECRs, we estimate what kind of sample is needed to do this analysis, and we show how to deal with the unknown\ndepth of a UHECR sample, using the GZK effect.\n\nLarge-Angle Clustering of UHECRs\nWe demonstrate what can be learned from the\nlarge-angle clustering of UHECRs by creating\nmock samples of UHECRs assuming different astrophysical sources and examining their resulting\nclustering. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [7] to create a volume-limited sam-\n\n\fC LUSTERING OF UHECR S\n\nple of galaxies that is complete out to a distance\nof 286Mpc. We select a sample of massive galaxy\nclusters in the same volume taken from a SDSS\ngroup and cluster catalog [2]. Based on their luminosities, we estimate these clusters to have masses\ngreater than 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . We then measure angular cross-correlation functions of each of these\nsamples with the galaxy sample (so, for the galaxy\ncase, we are measuring the autocorrelation) using\nthe Landy-Szalay [4] estimator:\n\u03c912 (\u03b8) =\n\nND1 D2 \u2212 ND1 R \u2212 ND2 R + NRR\n,\nNRR\n\nwhere ND1 D2 is the number of pairs as a function\nof \u03b8 between the two data samples (in this case,\ngalaxies and something else), ND1 R and ND2 R\nare the number of pairs as a function of \u03b8 between each data sample and a random sample,\nand NRR is the number of random-random pairs.\nFigure 1 shows the resulting angular correlation\nfunctions: cluster-galaxy, galaxy-galaxy, as well as\nthe random-galaxy case. As expected, the clustergalaxy correlation function has a higher amplitude\nthan the galaxy-galaxy correlation function on all\nangular scales, and the random-galaxy correlation\nfunction is equal to zero by construction.\nThese three curves represent predictions for the\nUHECR-galaxy cross-correlation function in the\nthree distinct cases that UHECRs originate from\nastrophysical sources that: (1) live in massive clusters, (2) live in ordinary galaxies, and (3) are\nuncorrelated with the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse, such as sources within the Milky Way\ngalaxy. The three cases predict different measured\nUHECR-galaxy correlation functions even at large\nangles, where UHECR direction uncertainties due\nto measurement error and magnetic deflections are\nunimportant.\nWe next examine how well we can distinguish between these different predictions assuming a sample of 1000 UHECRs. For the purpose of this test,\nwe assume that the sources of UHECRs are, in fact,\nordinary galaxies. We create a mock UHECR sample by randomly selecting 1000 galaxies from our\nSDSS galaxy sample. We create 200 independent\nmock samples in this way and measure their cross\ncorrelation with all galaxies. The shaded blue region in Figure 1 contains 95% (2\u03c3) of the mock\nrealizations. We then simulate arrival direction\n\nFigure 1: Predicted UHECR-galaxy angular crosscorrelation functions for the cases that the astrophysical sources of UHECRs are (1) uncorrelated\nwith the large-scale structure in the universe (black\nline), (2) ordinary galaxies (green curve), and (3)\nclusters of galaxies (magenta curve). The blue\nshaded region shows the 95% (2\u03c3) measurements\nusing 200 mock samples of 1000 UHECRs each,\nwhere the UHECRs are assumed to originate in\ngalaxies. The red shaded region shows the same,\nbut for mock UHECR arrival directions containing\n3\u25e6 random Gaussian errors. For this calculation, a\nSDSS galaxy sample of median depth 230Mpc was\nused.\nuncertainties by applying a random 3\u25e6 Gaussian\nsmearing to all our mock UHECRs and repeating\nthe correlation function measurements. The red\nshaded region in Figure 1 shows the 95% dispersion for these new measurements. As expected,\nthe 3\u25e6 smearing drastically reduces the correlation\nfunction at small angular scales, but has a negligible effect on scales larger than \u223c 2\u25e6 . Figure 1 shows that with a sample of 1000 UHECRs,\nthe measured clustering at large angles (\u2265 4\u25e6 )\nalone can easily distinguish between the \"cluster\",\n\"galaxy\", and \"random\" hypotheses.\n\n\f30 TH I NTERNATIONAL C OSMIC R AY C ONFERENCE\n\nWhat Kind of UHECR Sample Do We\nNeed?\nAlthough the sample of 1000 UHECRs used in\nFigure 1 is large compared to current available\nsamples, the sample depth in the above illustration\nis also large (median depth=230Mpc). The angular clustering will have a higher signal in shallower\nsamples because each angular bin will mix in fewer\nuncorrelated pairs, so we can get away with smaller\nUHECR samples in shallower volumes. We explore this in Figure 2, where we show the signal-tonoise (S/N) of a measured UHECR-galaxy crosscorrelation on large angular scales (6 \u2212 8\u25e6 ), as a\nfunction of sample size NCR and depth. In order to calculate this, we do the same sort of mock\nUHECR analysis as in Figure 1, but using galaxies\nfrom the 2MASS survey [3].\nFigure 2 shows that if we want a S/N=3 (99.7%\nsignificance) detection of UHECRs clustering like\nordinary 2MASS galaxies, we need 40 UHECRs\nof median source-distance dmed = 50Mpc, or\nNCR = 80 with dmed = 80Mpc, or NCR = 160\nwith dmed = 110Mpc, or NCR = 320 with\ndmed = 150Mpc.\nWe now return to the issue of the unknown depth\nof a given UHECR sample. Fortunately, the GZK\nenergy loss phenomenon provides a way to put a\nlimit on the depth of a UHECR sample. The rapid\nvariation with energy of the energy loss means that\nan ensemble of UHECRs of a given energy has a\nrather well-defined horizon within which they are\nproduced. If we assume that the energies of UHECRs are well determined, we can use the GZK\neffect to solve for the distance distribution of a\nUHECR sample, given an initial energy spectrum\nof cosmic rays. Assuming an E \u22122.7 energy spectrum, we compute the median depth of an UHECR\nsample as a function of its lower energy cutoff,\nand show the result in Figure 3. We can now\nuse Figure 3 to connect the sample depths shown\nin Figure 2 with energy cutoffs for UHECR samples. In our S/N=3 example, the required samples\nwould have 40, 80, 160, and 320 UHECRs with\nenergies above 90EeV, 56EeV, 45EeV, and 37EeV,\nrespectively. These samples are larger than currently available samples from AGASA+HiRes, but\nshould be available in the near future by the Pierre\nAuger experiment.\n\nFigure 2: Estimated signal-to-noise (S/N) for measurements of the UHECR-galaxy cross-correlation\nfunction on large angular scales (6 \u2212 8\u25e6) as a function of median sample depth and size of UHECR\nsample. This calculation was done using 2MASS\ngalaxy samples of various sample depths, and assuming that UHECRs originate from these same\ngalaxies. Different colored curves represent different size UHECR samples, as listed in the panel.\nThis plot answers the question: At what significance can we detect the cross-correlation between\nUHECRs and 2MASS galaxies at large angular\nscales, if we have a UHECR sample of size NCR\nand a given galaxy and UHECR sample depth?\n\nAcknowledgements\nFunding for the creation and distribution of the\nSDSS has been provided by the Alfred P.
