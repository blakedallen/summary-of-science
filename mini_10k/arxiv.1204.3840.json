It is now known that various interesting communication schemes, like\nteleportation [1,2,3] and dense coding [4,5,6], are possible when the laws of\nquantum mechanics are invoked in information processing. It was customary\nManik Banik\nPhysics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203 B.T. Road, Kolkata700108, India\nE-mail: manik11ju@gmail.com\nMd. Rajjak Gazi\nPhysics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203 B.T. Road, Kolkata700108, India\nE-mail: rajjakgazimath@gmail.com\n\n\f2\n\nManik Banik, Md. Rajjak Gazi\n\nto ignore the classical communication cost in different quantum information\nprocesses like entanglement distillation [7,8,9]. The motivation was that classical communication is free whereas entanglement is expensive. However, as\nemphasized in [10], in dense coding process classical communication cost is of\nprimary interest and one can not ignore it. On the other hand in quantum\nteleportation protocol classical communication is one of the required resource\nother than entanglement. An unknown qubit can be teleportated perfectly by\nusing a maximally entangled state and 2 bits of classical communication. Naturally, accuracy of the teleportation process decreases if noise is introduced\nin the quantum as well as classical channel. A lot of works has been devoted\nto study teleportation process in presence of noisy quantum channel [11,12,\n13,14], but very little is discussed about the efficiency of teleportation in case\nwhere classical channel is noisy. So it is also important to study quantum\nteleportation in presence of noisy classical channel.\nSuppose there are two spatially separated fellows, say Alice and Bob. Alice\nis holding a spin- 21 system in state |\u03c6i, where the state of the system |\u03c6i is\nunknown to her. Now challenge for them is to prepare the state |\u03c6i at Bob's\nlocation. Bennett et.al. have shown that this seemingly impossible task can be\ndone in quantum mechanical framework, which is known as quantum teleportation [1]. To be successful in this challenge, Alice and Bob must share two\ndifferent types of resources namely entanglement and classical communication.\nIn general they will not succeed in perfectly reproducing the state |\u03c6i at Bob's\nlocation, but will prepare some other state, denoted by |\u03c6\u2032 i if it is pure, or by \u03c7\n(density matrix) if it is mixed. The measure of success - the \"score\" obtained\ncan be quantified by |h\u03c6|\u03c6\u2032 i|2 or equivalently by Tr(\u03c7|\u03c6ihi\u03c6|). Suppose now\nthat this process is repeated many times, each time Alice gets an unknown\nparticle uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. The final score of the process - the average of the scores obtained in the different runs - is called the\nfidelity of the transmission [11]. If Alice and Bob cannot communicate at all,\nBob could try to guess the state, according to some particular scheme ( one\nof such scheme is that Bob will always prepare a particle in some state). The\nfidelity of any such guess scheme will be always 12 [11,15].\nIf Alice and Bob use no entanglement but classical communications then\nthey can raise the fidelity value beyond 12 . Alice measures her state and sends\nthe result to Bob, who makes his best guess of the state based on this information. The success of sending the state |\u03c6i is calculated as Fcl (|\u03c6i) =\nP\nn\n2\ni=1 p(i||\u03c6i)|h\u03c6|\u03b1i i| , where p(i||\u03c6i) = h\u03c6|Ai |\u03c6i is the probability of Alice obtaining the result corresponding to the positive operator Ai out of n\npossible outcomes\nPn of the positive operator valued measure (POVM) {Ai }\n[16,17], where\ni=1 Ai = 12 , with 12 denoting the identity operator; and\n|\u03b1i i be the Bob's guess, given outcome i. When the input state is completely unknown, the average of the success over a uniform distribution of\nall states on the Bloch sphere is taken to obtain the fidelity of the teleportashown that the fidelity in this case becomes\ntion process\nR Pn [18,19]. It has been\n2\np(i||\u03c6i)|h\u03c6|\u03b1\ni|\nd\u03a9\n= 32 [15], here d\u03a9 denote the haar measure\nFcl =\ni\ni=1\nover the set of pure states on the Bloch sphere and the subindex 'cl' denotes\n\n\fClassical communication and non-classical fidelity of quantum teleportation\n\n3\n\nthat only classical communication has been used as teleportation resource.\nThis value we call classical fidelity of teleportation process. In [11], Popescu\nshowed that if Alice performed a two outcomes projective measurement in\nany basis (say \u03c3z ) and communicated her measurement result to Bob, who\nprepared the particle either in \u03c3z -up or \u03c3z -down state depending on Alice's\nmeasurement result, then optimal classical fidelity (i.e. 23 ) can be achieved. If in\nany teleportation scheme the value of the teleportation fidelity becomes greater\nthan 23 , then one can conclude that some quantum entanglement must have\nbeen used in the process. When 2 bits of classical communication and maximally entangled state (e.g. singlet) are used in teleportation protocol the value\nof teleportation fidelity becomes unity, which reflects complete accuracy of the\nprocess. If the degree of entanglement used in the teleportation process is weakened in the form of Werner state W\u03b1 = \u03b1|\u03c8 singlet ih\u03c8 singlet | + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) 122 \u2297 122 ,\nthen teleportation fidelity takes the value F = 1+\u03b1\n2 [11]. The parameter (1\u2212\u03b1)\nin the Werner state W\u03b1 quantifies the amounts of white noise (i.e. 122 \u2297 122 )\npresent in the state W\u03b1 along with the singlet state. It is known that the state\nW\u03b1 is entangled for \u03b1 > 31 and therefore from the expression of F (= 1+\u03b1\n2 )\none can infer that to achieve the fidelity greater than the classical value the\nWerner state has to be necessarily entangled. Interestingly it has been shown\nthat any two-qubit entangled state is good for teleportation [20]. In this paper\nwe pose the following question: how much classical communication is necessary\nto achieve non-classical fidelity in quantum teleportation process when there\nis no restriction on entanglement? Interestingly we have found that:\n(a) If two independent 1-bit noisy classical channels are used then on average (0.255 + \u01eb) bits of classical communication (with \u01eb > 0) is sufficient to\nmake the teleportation fidelity non-classical.\n(b) In case of 2-bits noisy classical channel, on average (0.208 + \u01eb) bits of\nclassical communication (with \u01eb > 0) is sufficient to make the teleportation\nfidelity non-classical. We also argue that (0.208 + \u01eb) bits of classical communication is necessary if the quantum state transforms isotropically under\nteleportation process.\n(c) We have shown how the amount of classical communication increases\nwhen the entanglement, used in the teleportation process, is weakened.\nThe paper is organized in the following way. First, in section-2 and section3 we study teleportation process with 1-bit noisy classical channel and 2-bits\nnoisy classical channel respectively. Then in section-4 we discuss about necessary amount of classical communication required to get non classical fidelity\nwhen state transforms isotropically. In section-5 we find how the amount of\nclassical communication increases to get non classical fidelity when entangled\nchannel is weakened in Werner form.\n2 Teleportation with 1-bit noisy classical channel\nSuppose Alice has to teleport an unknown qubit state |\u03c61 i = a|01 i + b|11 i\nto Bob, |0i and |1i respectively denote the up and down eigenstate of spin\n\n\f4\n\nManik Banik, Md.

The 1-bit noisy classical channel\nCz (z \u2261 \u03b7, \u03b4) is characterized by the conditional probability :p(a|a) = z\np(\u0101|a) = 1 \u2212 z\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a \u2208 {0, 1} is Alice's input bit; \u0101 denote complement bit of a. The value of\nz lies between 12 and 1. The amount of classical communication is quantified as\nmutual information [21,22,23] between Alice's input and Bob's output, which\nis in this case :Cz := 1 \u2212 H(z)\n(2)\nwhere H(z) = \u2212z log2 z \u2212 (1 \u2212 z) log2 (1 \u2212 z) is the Shannon entropy [21,22].\nThe teleportation protocol goes as standard teleportation protocol [1] : Alice first performs measurement on the joint system of unknown qubit (particle\n1) and her part (particle 2) of the entangled pair in Bell basis (|\u03c8 \u00b1 i, |\u03c6\u00b1 i),\nWhere\n|00i \u00b1 |11i\n|01i \u00b1 |10i\n\u221a\n\u221a\n;\n|\u03c6\u00b1 i =\n(3)\n|\u03c8 \u00b1 i =\n2\n2\nAfter the measurement Alice sends the results to Bob by using the two noisy\nclassical channels. Bob, after receiving the classical bit, performs the unitary\noperation on his part (particle 3) of the entangled pair as required for perfect\nteleportation. This results the following density matrix for Bob's qubit;\n\u033a\u2032 = \u03b7\u03b4\u033a + \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3z \u033a\u03c3z + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03c3x \u033a\u03c3x ,\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3y \u033a\u03c3y\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u033a = |\u03c61 ih\u03c61 |. Measure of success is given by the quantity Tr[\u033a\u033a\u2032 ].\nAverage of this quantity over all possible pure states gives us the fidelity\nof the teleportation process [11]. For a qubit system the density matrix \u033a\nfor a pure state can be written as 21 (1 + n.\u03c3) where n \u2261 (nx , ny , nz ) \u2261\n(sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8) is unit vector on Poincar sphere and \u03c3 \u2261 (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z )\nwhere \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z are the Pauli operator. Therefore the fidelity of the teleportation process is the following;\nF = hTr[\u033a(\u03b7\u03b4\u033a + \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3z \u033a\u03c3z + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03c3x \u033a\u03c3x\n\n+(1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3y \u033a\u03c3y )]i\nZ\n= d\u033aTr[\u033a(\u03b7\u03b4\u033a + \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3z \u033a\u03c3z + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03c3x \u033a\u03c3x\n\n+(1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c3y \u033a\u03c3y )]\nZ\n= dn[\u03b7\u03b4 + \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4)n2z + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7)n2x\n+(1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4)n2y ]\n\n\fClassical communication and non-classical fidelity of quantum teleportation\n\nZ\n1\nsin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6[\u03b7\u03b4 + \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4) cos2 \u03b8\n4\u03c0\n+\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7) sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4) sin2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03c6]\n1\n= \u03b7\u03b4 + [\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4) + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b7) + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 \u03b4)]\n3\n1 + 2\u03b7\u03b4\n=\n3\n\n5\n\n=\n\n(5)\n\nIn teleportation process described above, the total classical communication\nused amounts to sum of the capacity (mutual information) of the two independent noisy classical channel i.e. [2 \u2212 H(\u03b7) \u2212 H(\u03b4)] claccical bit (cbit).

With the restriction \u03b7\u03b4 > 12 on the parameter \u03b7 and \u03b4, the\nminimum of the classical cost is found when \u03b7 = \u03b4 = \u221a12 . The optimal communication has been found to be [2 \u2212 H(\u03b7) \u2212 H(\u03b4)] \u2248 0.255 cbit. Thus we can\nsay that on average (0.255 + \u01eb) bits of classical communication with \u01eb > 0, is\nsufficient for achieving non-classical fidelity in the teleportation process when\ntwo independent noisy classical channels have been used.\n\n3 Teleportation with 2-bits noisy classical channel\nLet Alice and Bob are sharing a 2-bits noisy classical channel which is characterized by following conditional probability :P (ab|ab) = p1\nP (\u0101b|ab) = p2\nP (ab\u0304|ab) = p3\nP (\u0101b\u0304|ab) = p4\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ab etc. are Alice's inputs and take values from the set {00, 01, 10, 11} and\npi \u2265 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and \u03a3i pi = 1. The amount of classical communication is\nquantified as mutual information between Alice's input variables X and Bob's\noutputs variables Y\nI(X : Y ) = H(X) + H(Y ) \u2212 H(X, Y )\n4\n= 2 + \u03a3i=1\npi log2 (pi )\n\n(7)\n\nFrom the definition it is clear that at the two extreme cases, (i) one of pi = 1\nand (ii) all pi 's are equal, we have amount of classical communication 2 bits\nand 0 bit respectively.\nIf Alice and Bob follows the same teleportaion protocol as before, using\nthe 2-bits noisy classical channel, the resulting density matrix for Bob's qubit\nis as follows;\n\u033a\u2032 = p1 \u033a + p2 \u03c3x \u033a\u03c3x + p3 \u03c3z \u033a\u03c3z + p4 \u03c3y \u033a\u03c3y\n(8)\n\n\f6\n\nManik Banik, Md. Rajjak Gazi\n\nThe teleportation fidelity in this case becomes,\nF = hTr[\u033a(p1 \u033a + p2 \u03c3x \u033a\u03c3x + p3 \u03c3z \u033a\u03c3z + p4 \u03c3y \u033a\u03c3y )]i\n1\n= p1 + (p2 + p3 + p4 )\n3\n1 + 2p1\n=\n3\n\n(9)\n\nThe classical communication used in this process amounts to:\n4\nC = I(X : Y ) = 2 + \u03a3i=1\npi log2 (pi )\n\n(10)\n\nFrom Eqn.(9) it is clear that we will get non classical fidelity ( i.e. F > Fcl )\nif we have p1 > 21 . With this restriction on p1 we want to find the minimum\namount of classical communication C. From the expression of C it can be\nshown that the minimum will be achieved when p2 = p3 = p4 . Thus we have\n:1 \u2212 p1\n)\n(11)\nC = 2 + p1 log2 p1 + (1 \u2212 p1 ) log2 (\n3\nIn the range\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2264 p1 \u2264 1, C is a monotonic increasing function of p1 and the\n2.0\n\nC\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\np1\nFig. 1 The parameter p1 is plotted along x axis and along y axis classical communication\nC is plotted. Clearly C is monotonic increasing function within the range 12 \u2264 p1 \u2264 1. At\np1 = 21 we have C \u223c\n= 0.208. In the plot black dot indicates this point.\n\nvalue of C at p1 = 12 is C 21 \u2248 0.208. Therefore we can say that on average\n(0.208 + \u01eb) bits of classical communication (\u01eb > 0) is sufficient to get non\nclassical teleportation fidelity. It is interesting to note that we are getting the\noptimal value of classical cost when p2 = p3 = p4 and in this case the final\ndensity matrix is given by 21 [1 + (2f \u2212 1)n.\u03c3], where f = 2p13+1 ; which means\nthat the optimality is achieved when the state transform isotropically.\n\n\fClassical communication and non-classical fidelity of quantum teleportation\n\n7\n\n4 Necessary communication when state transforms isotropically\nNow we will show that 0.208 bits of classical communication is necessary to obtain non classical fidelity of the teleportation process which transform the state\nisotropically. To prove this, we assume there is a teleportation process which\ntransform the state isotropically but at the same time attain non-classical\nfidelity by using (0.208 \u2212 \u01eb) bits of classical communications. Let Alice and\nBob share a singlet state and Alice in order to send two bits of classical information, applies the unitary transformation accordingly as is done in the\nstandard dense coding protocol [7]. Then Alice teleports the qubit to Bob by\nthe teleportation channel with non-classical fidelity which use (0.208 \u2212 \u01eb) bits\nof classical communications and transform the state isotropically.\nDepending on the Alice's applied unitary transformation, the four possible\ntwo-qubit density matrices on Bob's side are as follows:\u03c1i =\n\n(1 \u2212 p1 )\n(4p1 \u2212 1)\n14 +\n(\u03c3i \u2297 12 )|\u03c8 \u2212 ih\u03c8 \u2212 |(\u03c3i \u2297 12 )\n3\n3\n\n(12)\n\nwhere 14 (12 ) be the 4\u00d74 (2\u00d72) identity matrix; i = 0, x, y, z with \u03c30 = 12 . All\nthe density matrices \u03c1i occur with equal probability. The amount of classical\nbit that can be extracted [22,23] from an ensemble of density matrix {pi , \u03c0i }\n(\u03c0i 'sP\nare density matrices and pi be a valid probability distribution i.e. pi \u2265 0\nand i pi = 1) is bounded by the Holevo quantity \u03c7 [24] which is given by:\n\u03c7 := S(\u03c0) \u2212\n\nX\n\npi S(\u03c0i ),\n\n(13)\n\ni\n\nP\nwhere \u03c0 = i pi \u03a0i and S(\u2217) denote the Von Neumann entropy [22]. For the\nensemble of the density matrices of Eqn.-(12) the Holevo quantity becomes:\n\u03c7 = 2 + p1 log2 p1 + (1 \u2212 p1 ) log2 (\n\n1 \u2212 p1\n)\n3\n\n(14)\n\nand \u03c7 is (0.208 + \u01eb) for non-classical fidelity. Interestingly, this bound can\nbe achieved by making measurement on two-qubit in the Bell basis and Bob\ncan extract classical information as done in super dense coding. But this implies that by communicating (0.208 \u2212 \u01eb) bits of classical information, one\ncan generate 0.208 bits, which violates causality principle. This proves that\n(0.208+\u01eb) bits of classical communication are necessary for teleportation which\nis isotropic and achieves quantum fidelity.\n\n5 Teleportation with Werner channel supported by noisy classical\nchannel\nLet Alice and Bob share Werner state W\u03b1 = \u03b1|\u03c8 \u2212 ih\u03c8 \u2212 | + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) 122 \u2297 122 as\nresource for teleportation. And as classical supporting channel if they share\n\n\f8\n\nManik Banik, Md.

Therefore the amount of sufficient communication for achieving non classical fidelity when Werner state supported\n1+\u03b1\nby 2-bits noisy classical channel is given by C(\u03b1) = 2 + 1+\u03b1\n4\u03b1 log2 ( 4\u03b1 ) +\n3\u03b1\u22121\n3\u03b1\u22121\nlog\n(\n).\n2 12\u03b1\n4\u03b1\nIf 1-bits noisy classical channel is shared between Alice and Bob along with\nthe Werner channel then teleportation fidelity becomes:\nF =\n\n3 \u2212 \u03b1 + 4\u03b1\u03b7\u03b4\n6\n\n(16)\n\nClearly in this case condition for getting non classical fidelity is \u03b7\u03b4 \u2265 1+\u03b1\n4\u03b1 .\nWhen 1-bit noisy classical channelq\nis used theq\nsufficient classical\ncommunicaq\n\n1+\u03b1\n1+\u03b1\ntion cost becomes C \u2032 (\u03b1) = 2[1 + 1+\u03b1\n4\u03b1 log2 (\n4\u03b1 ) + (1 \u2212\n4\u03b1 ) log2 (1 \u2212\nq\n1\n1+\u03b1\n1\n4\u03b1 )]. For \u03b1 = 3 Werner state becomes separable. Therefore using W 3\n2.0\n\nClass. Commu.

Interestingly more the noise is introduced in entanglement, more the\nclassical communication is needed to achieve non-classical fidelity. From the plot it is clear\nthat 2-bits noisy classical channel is more useful than two independent 1-bit noisy classical\nchannel through the whole region of the parameter \u03b1.\n\nwe can never achieve fidelity grater than 32 . From Fig-(2) it is clear that if\nwe follow the standard teleportation protocol using W 13 state supported with\nnoisy classical channel then both for 2-bits noisy classical channel and two independent 1-bit noisy classical channels, the required clssical communication\namounts to 2-cbits. Thus performing standard teleportation protocol is not a\n\n\fClassical communication and non-classical fidelity of quantum teleportation\n\n9\n\nclever way when W 31 state is shared. In this case following the procedure of\n[11] one can achieve 32 fidelity with help of 1-classical bit.\n6 Discussion\nOur result shows that in quantum teleportation, there is a threshold amount\nof classical communication that is required for achieving non classical fidelity.\nThe optimal amount of classical communication that is necessary for achieving\nnon-classical fidelity in quantum teleportation still remains an open problem.\nWe only provide sufficient amount in two cases. In case of isotropic state\ntransformation, we find the necessary amount of classical communication to\nreach quantum fidelity. We also show that the sufficient amount of classical\ncommunications increase with weakening of the singlet state to Werner state. It\nremains interesting to study the necessary amount of classical communication\nfor a general entangled state used as teleportation resources.\nAcknowledgements We like to thank G.Kar for many simulating discussion and giving\nsuggestions regarding the use of 2-bits noisy classical channel.
