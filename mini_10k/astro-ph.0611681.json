In order to shed new light on this controversy, we propose here a new phenomenological description of the total\nmass profile of galaxies.\nMethods. Under the hypothesis of spherical symmetry, we assume a double power - law expression for the global mass - to light\n(hereafter M/L) ratio \u03a5(r) = M (r)/L(r) = \u03a50 (r/r0 )\u03b1 (1 + r/r0 )\u03b2 with (\u03a50 , r0 ) scaling parameters and (\u03b1, \u03b2) determining the\ninner and outer slope of the M/L ratio. In particular, \u03a5 \u221d r \u03b1 for r/r0 << 1 so that \u03b1 = 0 mimics a constant M/L ratio in\nthe inner regions, while, for (r/r0 >> 1), \u03a5 \u221d r \u03b1+\u03b2 thus showing that models with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 have an asymptotically constant\nM/L ratio. A wide range of possibilities is obtained by varying the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) in the range we determine on the\nbasis of physical considerations. Choosing a general expression for the luminosity density profile j(r), we work out an effective\ngalaxy model that accounts for all the phenomenology observed in real elliptical galaxies. We derive the main dynamics and\ngravitational lensing properties of such an effective model.\nResults. We analyze a general class of models, able to take into account different dynamical trends. We are able to obtain\nanalytical expressions for the main dynamical and lensing quantities. We show that constraining the values of \u03b1 + \u03b2 makes it\npossible to analyze the problem of the dark matter in elliptical galaxies. Indeed, positive values of \u03b1 + \u03b2 would be a strong\nevidence for dark matter.\nConclusions.

Introduction\nApplying the virial theorem to the Coma cluster to estimate its mass, Zwicky (1937) provided the first evidence\nof the presence of significant amounts of dark matter.\nNotwithstanding the great theoretical, computational and\nobservational efforts spent by both astronomers and particle physicists, the nature, the properties and the distribution of the elusive component remain still unsolved\nproblems more than 70 years after the pioneering work of\nZwicky. Solving these problems stands as one of the most\nchallenging yet fascinating issues of modern astrophysics.\nAlthough detectable only through its gravitational effect, dark matter leaves its imprint on a wide variety of\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nctortora@na.infn.it\n\nto:\n\nC.Tortora\n\ne-mail:\n\nobservational probes. Rotation curves of spiral galaxies\n(see, e.g., Sofue & Rubin 2001 for a comprehensive review) are a textbook example. The presence of HI and H\u03b1\ngas makes it possible to reliably determine the kinematics and dynamics of these systems. Modelling the galaxy\nwith the luminous and the gas components only is unable\nto fit the observed rotation curve unless the mass - to light (hereafter M/L) ratio is unacceptably higher than\nwhat is predicted on the basis of stellar population synthesis models. Going up to the cosmological scales, the\nremarkable success of the concordance \u039bCDM model (according to which the cosmological constant \u039b and the cold\ndark matter are the main contributors to the total energy\ndensity budget) in fitting almost the full set of available\nastrophysical data (Spergel et al. 2003, Riess et al. 2004 )\nprovide a further strong evidence in favor of dark mat-\n\n\f2\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nter. Moreover, in this same framework, the presence of\nCDM is mandatory in order to reproduce the observed\nmatter power spectrum inferred from large galaxy surveys\n(Hawkins et al. 2003, Pope et al. 2004).\nHowever, despite the great success on cosmological\nscales, the concordance model is affected by serious\nshortcomings on the galaxy scales. Indeed, numerical\nsimulations of structure formation in the \u039bCDM scenario\nfurnish some hints on the mass profiles of dark matter\nhaloes. While there is a general consensus that relaxed\nhaloes exhibit a density profile that is well described by a\ndouble power law with outer asymptotic slope \u22123, there\nis still controversy about the value of the inner asymptotic slope with proposed values mainly in the range\n\u223c 1.0 \u2212 1.5, predicting the so called cuspy mass density\nmodels (see Navarro et al. 1996, Navarro et al. 1997,\nMoore et al. 1998, Ghigna et al. 2000, Power et al. 2003,\nNavarro et al. 2004). The first results indicated\nan inner slope equal to 1 (Navarro et al. 1996,\nNavarro et al. 1997), on the contrary other studies generated a more steeper slope equal to 1.5 (Moore et al. 1998,\nGhigna et al. 2000,\nFukushige & Makino 2001).\nWhichever is the actual value of the inner slope,\nobservations of rotation curves strongly disfavor the\npresence of any cusp giving, on the contrary, strong\nsupport to shallower density profiles (the so called cored\nmodels with an inner slope < 1) in fierce disagreement\nwith results of simulations (McGaugh & de Blok 1998,\nBinney & Evans 2001, de Blok et al. 2001). It is worth\nstressing that the usual modeling of spiral galaxies does\nnot take into account the presence of spiral arms and\nthe possible clumpy distribution of the gas component.\nBoth these effects may introduce non circular motions\ncausing systematical errors in the determination of\nthe rotation curve or in inferring constraints on the\nmass model from the fit to the data. Although recent\nhigher resolution simulations seem to partially alleviate both the cusp and the substructure problems\n(Macci\u00f2 et al. 2006a, Macci\u00f2 et al. 2006b), several alternative scenarios have been proposed in order to solve\nthese issues ranging from modifications of the fundamental properties of dark matter particles to changes in the\nlaws of gravity (Carroll et al. 2005). A different kind of\napproach is followed by M\u00fccket & Hoeft (2003), that\nsolving the Jean's equation with suitable assumptions on\nthe gravitational potential found an inner slope \u2264 0.5. If\nconfirmed, these contrasting results may offer the chance\nto falsify the CDM paradigm on galaxy scales or, at\nleast, can furnish a fundamental support to drive N-body\nsimulation analysis.\nIt is therefore interesting to look at elliptical galaxies\nin order to avoid some of the observational problems described above and to investigate whether dark matter is\nindeed ubiquitous as expected. Unfortunately, here the situation is complicated by both observational and theoretical difficulties. On one hand, the lack of a well understood\nmass tracer makes it difficult to measure kinematics out to\nthe largest radii where dark matter is supposed to domi-\n\nnate. On the other hand, interpreting the results is complicated by the strong degeneracy between mass model and\nanisotropy in the velocity space. As a consequence, the\npresence of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is still a matter of debate. Using different tracers and modeling techniques, Mould et al. (1990) and Franx et al. (1994) found\npositive evidences of massive dark matter halos around\nearly type galaxies, while no dark matter is needed to fit\nthe measured velocity dispersion in some of the galaxies considered by Bertin et al. (1994) and Gerhard et al.\n(2001). Satellite dynamics (Romanowsky et al. 2001) and\nX - ray mass estimates (Loewenstein & White 1999) adds\nfurther support in favour of dark matter, while opposite\nresults have been recently obtained using planetary nebulae to probe the outer regions (Romanowsky et al. 2003).\nFurthermore, Mamon & Lokas (2005a,b) have recently\nshown that NFW - like density profiles are not able to reproduce the global mass profile of elliptical galaxies whose\ninternal kinematics turn out to be well fitted by constant\nM/L ratio models thus arguing against the presence of\ndark matter haloes.\nIn order to improve our knowledge of dark matter\nhaloes, one has to look for alternative mass probes such\nas gravitational lensing. Born as mere scientific curiosity\npredicted by general relativity, gravitational lensing has\nnowadays given rise to a full sector of modern astronomy\ngiven its versatility that renders it an ideal tool to investigate a wide range of astrophysical phenomena (see, e.g.,\nSchneider, Ehlers & Falco 1992 and Petters et al. 2001\nfor illuminating textbooks). Since elliptical galaxies represent \u223c 80% of lens galaxies in multiply imaged quasar\nsystems (Fukugita & Turner 1991), reconstructing the\nmass model for these systems gives interesting constraints\non the dark matter haloes surrounding the lens (see,\ne.g., Kochanek 1995, Romanowsky & Kockanek 1997,\nKeeton et al. 1998, Treu & Koopmans 2004 for a far to\nbe exhaustive list of references). Galaxy - galaxy lensing\n(Fisher et al. 2000, Guzik & Seljak 2002) is another\nopportunity to investigate dark matter resorting to the\nweak lensing regime.\nWhile the use of lensing data alleviates the problem\nwith observational issue, there is still a theoretical prejudice concerning the choice of dark matter profile, which\ncan crucially influence the results. Even if there is a long\nand illustrious tradition of mass models for early type\ngalaxies, ranging from distribution function based ones,\nto mass density profile or gravitational potential potential based ones, we present a new parametrization of the\nmass profile, describing the M/L ratios as a double power\nlaw. Thus, we propose here to replace the actual elliptical\ngalaxy with an effective one with a mass profile M (r) given\nas \u03a5(r)\u00d7L(r), with L(r) the deprojected luminosity distribution. A key role is played by the global M/L ratio \u03a5(r)\nwhich we parameterize as \u03a5(r) = \u03a50 (r/r0 )\u03b1 (1 + r/r0 )\u03b2\nwith \u03a50 a strength parameter, r0 a length scale, while \u03b1\nand \u03b2 determines the asymptotic behaviors of the M/L\nratio for r/r0 << 1 and r/r0 >> 1, respectively. The\nansatz adopted for \u03a5(r) has the virtue of being quite sim-\n\n\fC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nple so that many dynamical and lensing quantities may\nbe expressed analytically or in terms of special functions.\nNevertheless, it is also quite versatile giving the possibility to mimic the main features of a wide range of models1 .\nFor instance, constant M/L models are obtained by setting (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 0), while models with \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 0 mimic\nthe effect of dark matter haloes on the global M/L ratio.\nMoreover, in the inner regions the main kinematic and\ndynamical quantities does not depend on \u03b2, and if we set\n\u03b1 = 0 will only depend on the M/L strength \u03a50 and\nthe parameters which characterize the luminosity profile\nin agreement with the tentative conclusion of Mamon &\nLokas (Mamon & Lokas 2005a) that mass follows light in\nthe interiors of elliptical galaxies.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce our parametrization of the global M/L ratio discussing the role played by the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) and\nthe asymptotic behaviours. The basic properties of the\nresulting effective galaxy model are presented in Sect. 3\nwhere we also compare our model with some widely used\nalternative descriptions of elliptical galaxies. Dynamical\nand lensing properties of the model are presented with\ngreat detail in Sects. 4 and 5 respectively. A summary of\nthe main results and some perspectives on constraining\nthe model parameters through observations are presented\nin the concluding Sect. 6.\n\n2. A variable M/L ratio\nThe approach to the problem of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is a two step process, where, first, the projected light distribution is deconvolved to a three dimensional mass density by assuming a constant M/L ratio\nand second, a dark halo mass profile is added to the luminous component.The theoretically predicted luminosity\nweighted velocity dispersion (projected along the line of\nsight) is then compared to the observational data, in order\nto determine the stellar M/L ratio and the parameters of\nthe halo model. A successful result of such a fitting procedure is considered as an evidence of the presence of dark\nmatter, while the possibility of fitting the same data with a\nconstant M/L model and no dark halo argues against the\npresence of this unseen component. Needless to say, the\nprocedure crucially depends on the choice of the model\nfor the dark matter distribution.\nIn order to alleviate such a problem we work out a family of galaxy models which is able to reproduce, through an\nappropriate parametrization, a wide variety of behaviours\nin the galaxy mass density distribution, including both\nthe situation where the dark matter is dominating as well\nthe situation where the stellar component is predominant\nAs a consequence such a kind of models can be used to\nanalyze and shape a whole sample of galaxies in a homogeneous way. To this end, it is worth noting that in\n1\n\nAnother possible phenomenological approach has been recently investigated by (Napolitano et al. 2004), but they only\nconsidered an empirical gradient of the M/L ratio assuming\nan a priori model for the dark matter halo density profile.\n\n3\n\nconstant M/L models, the mass follows the light, while\nthis does not hold anymore in presence of a dark halo.\nActually, defining \u03a5(r) \u2261 M (r)/L(r) with M (r) and L(r)\nthe total mass and luminosity respectively within a distance r from the galaxy center, it is straightforward to\nunderstand that, in presence of a dark matter halo, M (r)\nstill increases for values of r beyond the visible edges of\nthe galaxy so that \u03a5(r) turns out to be monotonically increasing function in the outer regions. On the opposite,\nin absence of a dark matter halo, M (r) follows L(r) thus\nleading to \u03a5(r) \u223c constant. Note, however, that, strictly\nspeaking, having a constant M/L is not a sufficient probe\nagainst the presence of dark matter. Actually, it is possible that \u03a5(r) is a weak function of r over the range probed\nby the data so that detecting its variation is quite hard\nif the data are not of very good quality. Should, however,\n\u03a5(r) \u2243 \u03a50 \u2243 \u03a5\u22c6 with \u03a5\u22c6 the stellar M/L ratio predicted\nby population synthesis models, then one could indeed argue that there is no need of dark matter. As a consequence,\nwe may reconsider the problem of dark matter in elliptical\ngalaxies as that of directly understanding whether \u03a5(r) is\nconstant or not and, if yes, what is its trend as a function\nof the radius. Thus, we assume a phenomenological ansatz\nfor the M/L ratio that is able to smoothly interpolate between the two opposite cases. The only other ingredient\nneeded to model the galaxy is then the luminosity density.\nAlthough it is in principle possible that the stellar M/L\nratio changes with r because of a distance dependent distribution of massive stars, it is worth stressing that color\ngradients are often too low to motivate a strong variation of \u03a5\u22c6 . As a consequence, we may safely consider an\nincreasing M/L as a clear signal of a dark matter halo.\nAssuming spherical symmetry, we propose the following expression for the M/L ratio :\nM (r)\n= \u03a50\n\u03a5(r) \u2261\nL(r)\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nr0\n\n\u0013\u03b1 \u0012\n\u0013\u03b2\nr\n1+\nr0\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03a50 a scaling M/L ratio, r0 a reference radius and\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) two slope parameters that we will constrain later\non the basis of physical considerations only. Note that for\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 0) the model reduces to the constant M/L\ncase with \u03a5(r) = \u03a50 . A no dark matter model is then\nobtained setting (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 0) and \u03a50 \u2243 \u03a5\u22c6 .\nThe slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) drive the asymptotic behaviors of \u03a5(r) :\n\uf8f1 \u03b1\nfor r/r0 << 1\n\uf8f2r\n\u03a5(r) \u221d\n(2)\n\uf8f3 \u03b1+\u03b2\nr\nfor r/r0 >> 1\n\nso that it is clear that \u03b1 determines the slope of the M/L\nratio in the inner regions, while \u03b2 enters the determination of the outer slope. As shown in Fig. 1, the reference\nradius r0 marks the transition from the inner to the outer\nasymptotic slopes.\nEq. (2) helps drawing some useful qualitative considerations to constrain the parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2). First, let us\n\n\f4\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\n3. Basic properties\n\n15\n12.5\n10\nU\n\n7.5\n5\n2.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\ny\n\nFig. 1. Global M/L ratio \u03a5 as a function of y \u2261 r/r0\nsetting \u03a50 = 4, \u03b2 = 0.3. The inner slope \u03b1 takes values\nfrom \u22120.3 to 0.3 (in steps of 0.1) from the lightest to the\nboldest curve.\nremind that, since both M (r) and L(r) vanish at r = 0,\nwe expect that \u03a5(r) could diverge, take a constant value\nor converge to 0. In Fig. 1 we plot \u03a5 as a function of the\nradial coordinate r, fixing \u03b2 and allowing \u03b1 to vary and\nassume both negative and positive values. An inspection\nof the figure shows us that negative values of \u03b1 give diverging values of \u03a5 for r \u2192 0, on the contrary null or positive\n\u03b1 give a \u03a5 that becomes finite or null. Having \u03a5(r) \u2192 \u221e\nas r \u2192 0 could seem unrealistic since one could argue for a\nhuge content of dark matter in the inner regions, but this\nis not the case, since it is possible that L(r) \u2192 0 more\nrapidly than M (r).\nOn the other hand, it is easy to see that models with\n\u03b1+\u03b2 = 0 describes galaxies with finite total mass since, in\nthis case, both M (r) and L(r) for r >> r0 are constants.\nMoreover, since M (r) is asymptotically increasing or flat,\nwhile L(r) is constant, \u03a5(r) should be an increasing or flat\nfunction of r for r >> r0 thus leading to the constraint\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2265 0. As we will see later, we will recover these same\nconstraints from a different and more physically motivated\nperspective.\nAs a final remark, let us remember that we have\nassumed spherical symmetry. Actually, real galaxies are\nhardly spherically symmetric, but are intrinsically ellipsoidal or triaxial systems. However, an ellipsoidal or triaxial version of the model we will investigate may be\nobtained by replacing in Eq. (1) the spherical radius\nr with the elliptical m = (x2 + y 2 + z 2 /q 2 )1/2 or the\ntriaxial one m\u0303 = (x2 + y 2 /p2 + z 2 /q 2 )1/2 with q and\np the major - to - minor and intermediate - to - minor axial ratios (Binney & Tremaine 1987). Models which result\nfrom equation (1), after such replacement, are similar to\nthe spherical ones in some important properties such as\nmass profiles. Moreover, it is worth remembering the existence of a degeneracy among mass, anisotropy and flattening that makes it possible, at least in principle, to mimic\na flattening of the system with an anisotropic velocity distribution (Magorrian & Ballantyne 2001). Finally, using\nspherical symmetry allows us to express the main quantities of interest in terms of analytical or special functions.\n\nThe ansatz (1) is the main ingredient of our approach\nto the dark matter problem in elliptical galaxies. In order to complete the description of a galaxy, we need\nto choose a luminosity density profile that, when projected on the plane of the sky, is able to fit the observed surface brightness. The ideal route to follow should\nbe to deproject the Sersic profile (Sersic 1968) since this\nis known to well fit the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies (Caon et al. 1993, Graham & Colless 1997,\nPrugniel & Simien 1997). Although this is mathematically possible (Mazure & Capelato 2002), the result is expressed in terms of unusual special functions and is therefore of little practical utility. A different way is to choose a\nluminosity density profile whose two dimensional projection mimics the de Vaucouleurs law (de Vaucouleurs 1948)\nsince this profile also gives a good fit to elliptical galaxies. A versatile family of models suitable for our study is\nprovided by the Dehnen (1993) models whose luminosity\ndensity is :\n\u0010 r \u0011\u2212\u03b3 \u0010\nr \u0011\u03b3\u22124\n1+\n(3)\nj(r) = j0\na\na\n\nwith j0 and a scaling quantities and \u03b3 a positive slope parameter. Note that the model reduces to the Jaffe (1983)\nand Hernquist (1990) ones for \u03b3 = 2 and \u03b3 = 1 respectively. The luminosity density scales as r\u2212\u03b3 at the centre, while asymptotically decreases as r\u22124 . The constraint\n\u03b3 < 3 ensures that the model is physically well behaved,\nbut, actually, only models with \u03b3 \u2264 2 are interesting\nsince their surface density fits well the de Vaucouleurs\nlaw provided the scale radius a is expressed in terms of\nthe effective radius\nRe . In particular, for \u03b3 = 1, it is\n\u221a\na = 1.33(1 + 2)\u22121 Re , while similar relations hold for\nother values of \u03b3 (Dehnen 1993). Models with 2 < \u03b3 < 3\nare still meaningful, but have some disturbing features\nsuch as an infinite central potential and a diverging central velocity dispersion. In the following, we will set \u03b3 as\na free parameter, but in the figures we will set \u03b3 = 1 in\norder to recover the widely used Hernquist model.\nBeing the model spherically symmetric, it is immediate\nto evaluate the luminosity density. Inserting Eq. (3) into\nthe standard relation\nZ r\nL(r) =\n4\u03c0r\u20322 j(r\u2032 )dr\u2032\n0\n\nwe easily get :\nL(r) = Ltot x3\u2212\u03b3 (1 + x)\u03b3\u22123\n\n(4)\n\nwith x \u2261 r/a and Ltot the total luminosity given by :\nLtot =\n\n4\u03c0j0 a3\n.\n3\u2212\u03b3\n\n(5)\n\nNote that the constraint \u03b3 < 3 ensures that the total\nluminosity is finite and that L(r) does not diverge at the\ncentre as it is physically reasonable.\n\n\fC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\n3.1. Mass profile\nHaving chosen a model for the luminosity density, the\nmass profile of the galaxy is immediately obtained from\nthe definition of M/L ratio and the ansatz (1) :\nM (x) =\n\n\u03a50 Ltot x\u2212\u03b1\n0\n\n3+\u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n\nx\n\n\u03b3\u22123\n\n(1 + x)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b2\nx\n1+\n(6)\nx0\n\nwith x0 \u2261 r0 /a. In particular, we note that, the larger\nare \u03b2 or \u03b1, the greater is the value of the total mass. For\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 we have a finite mass.\nEq. (6) makes it possible to put physically motivated\nconstraints on the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2). First, the mass\nprofile must vanish at the centre so that we get :\nM (r = 0) = 0 \u2192 3 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 > 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b1 > \u03b3 \u2212 3 .\n\n(7)\n\nLet us now consider the asymptotic behaviour at infinity2 :\n\uf8f1\nfor \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 0\n\uf8f2\u221e\nlim M (r) = \u03a50 Ltot for \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 .\n(8)\nr\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor \u03b1 + \u03b2 < 0\nNeedless to say, a null total mass is unphysical so that\nEq.(8) leads to the constraint :\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b1 \u2265 \u2212\u03b2 .\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the case \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 individuates models with\nfinite total mass as we have argued above directly from\nEq. (1).\n\n3.2. Mass density profile\n\ndM\n1\n1 dM\n=\n4\u03c0r2 dr\n4\u03c0a3 x2 dx\n\nwe easily get :\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03a50 Ltot \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\nx\n(1+x)\u03b3\u22124\n4\u03c0a3 x\u03b1+1\n0\n\nFirst, we note that models with a cusp are obtained for\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 < 0, while a flat inner core is present for models\nwith \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0. Moreover, since the mass density cannot\nincrease with r, we get the constraint :\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b3 \u22640\u2192\u03b1\u2264\u03b3 .\n\n(13)\n\nLet us study now the behaviour in the opposite limit,\ni.e. for x >> 1. In this case, we have to consider separately\nmodels with infinite or finite total mass. In the former\ncase, \u03b1 + \u03b2 6= 0 and we get :\n\u03c1(x) \u221d x\u03b1+\u03b2\u22123\n\nfor x >> 1 ,\n\nwhile for models with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0, it is :\n\u001a \u22124\nx\nfor 3 \u2212 \u03b3 6= \u03b1x0\n\u03c1(x) \u221d\nx\u22125 for 3 \u2212 \u03b3 = \u03b1x0\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nImposing that \u03c1 is a decreasing function at infinity makes\nit possible to further constrain the slope parameters.\nConsidering Eqs.(14), we thus get :\n\u03b1+\u03b2\u22123<0\u2192\u03b1<3\u2212\u03b2 .\n\n(16)\n\n3.3. Surface mass density\nIt is worth deriving the surface mass density of the model\nsince this will enter the derivation of the lensing quantities\nwhich Sect. 5 is devoted to. To this aim, we start by the\nusual definition :\nZ +\u221e\n\u03c1(r1 , r2 , r3 )dr3 ,\n(17)\n\u03a3=\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor spherically symmetric models, the mass density may\nbe evaluated differentiating the mass profile. Inserting\nEq.(6) into the usual relation\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n5\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b2\u22121\nx\n1+\nP(x)(10)\nx0\n\nwith (r1 , r2 ) cartesian coordinates in the plane orthogonal to the line of sight and r3 along the line of sight.\nInserting the mass density (15) in Eq.(17) and changing\nto cylindrical coordinates, one gets (see Appendix A in\nSand et al. 2004) :\nLtot \u03a50 x\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2\n0\n\u03a3(\u03be) =\n2 \u03c0 rs 2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03be 1+\u03b1\u2212\u03b3 csc(\u03b8)2+\u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n\n0\n\n\u00d7 (1 + \u03be csc(\u03b8))\u22124+\u03b3 (x0 + \u03be csc(\u03b8))\u22121+\u03b2\n\nwith\n\n\u00d7 [x0 (3 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3) + (3 + \u03b1 + x0 \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3) \u03be csc(\u03b8)\n\nP \u2261 (\u03b1+\u03b2)x2 +[3 + \u03b1(1 + x0 ) + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3] x+(3+\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)x0 .(11)\n\n+ (\u03b1 + \u03b2) \u03be 2 csc(\u03b8)2 ] d\u03b8.\n\nThe mass density in Eq.(10) must be physically reasonable\nso that we can further constrain (\u03b1, \u03b2). To this aim, let us\nconsider its asymptotic behaviours. In the inner regions,\nit is :\n\u03c1(x) \u221d x\u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n2\n\nfor x << 1 .\n\n(12)\n\nAlthough a finite total mass is a desirable feature, there\nare plenty of interesting models with a formally infinite total\nmass that are typically truncated by hand at the virial radius\nthus obtaining a finite total mass.\n\n(18)\np\nr12 + r22 . Eq.(18) may be\nwhere \u03be = R/a, with R =\nanalytically evaluated only in the case x0 = 1 otherwise\nnumerical integration is needed. However, also for x0 = 1,\nthe result turns out to be a rather messy combination\nof special functions so that it is preferable to resort to\nnumerical integration also in this case.\nThe asymptotic trends of the surface mass density depend on which is the range \u03b1 lies in. If \u03b3 \u2212 2 < \u03b1 < \u03b3 \u2212 13 ,\n3\nSee Eq. (32) to motivate the lower bound, more stringent\nthan Eq. (7)\n\n\f6\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\n\u03a3(\u03be) \u2192 \u03be \u03b1\u2212\u03b3+1 for \u03be \u2192 0, while, \u03a3 asymptotes to a constant value in the same limit for (\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b3. These\nregimes were qualitatively analyzed in the previous section and can be inspected in Fig. 1, where it is clear how\nthe inner trend of the M/L ratio is crucially dependent\non the choice of \u03b1. On the other hand, \u03a3 \u221d \u03be \u03b1+\u03b2\u22122 for\n\u03be \u2192 \u221e, which is expected given the outer slope of the\nthree dimensional mass density.\nFurther constraints on the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) may\nbe obtained considering the above asymptotic scaling of\n\u03a3(\u03be). Indeed, imposing that \u03a3(\u03be) is always decreasing,\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) must satisfy the constraints \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 + 1 < 0 and\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 2 < 0. In particular, for \u03b3 = 1, the first constraint\ntranslates to \u03b1 < 0, and an asymptotic flat \u03a3(\u03be) for \u03be \u2192 0\nis obtained when is \u03b1 \u2265 0. Thus, \u03b1 crucially influences\nthe inner trend of \u03a3 similarly to what done for \u03a5. The\nother constraint further reduces the range of variability of\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 in Eq. (16), giving the condition \u03b1 < 2 \u2212 \u03b2.\n\n3.4. A general comment on our effective model\nA general comment is in order here. The philosophy motivating our approach to the dark matter in elliptical galaxies is favored by the phenomenology of the problem. We\nhave adopted an ansatz for the M/L ratio and a model\nfor the luminosity distribution and are now working out\nthe basic properties of a system that may be described by\nthese two assumptions. Strictly speaking, this system does\nnot represent the actual galaxy, but it is an effective model\nof the galaxy. Should dark matter be indeed present, the\ngalaxy must be correctly modelled as a two components\nsystem with a dark halo embedding the luminous component. However, from the point of view of an observer, the\ndynamical quantities that can be measured and compared\nwith the theoretical predictions (such as the rotation curve\nand the velocity dispersion) are determined by the total\nmass and density profile only. As a consequence, describing the galaxy with an effective model is phenomenologically equivalent to modeling the system with two different\ncomponents. Actually, one could fit an effective galaxy\nmodel and then decompose it in a luminous component\nplus a dark matter halo determining the density profile of\nthe halo as \u03c1h = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03a5\u22c6 j(r) with \u03c1 given by Eq.(10). In\nthe phenomenological approach we are pursuing here, we\nonly need to study the dynamical and lensing properties\nof the effective model defined by Eqs.(1) and (3), while\ndisentangling the two components is not necessary.\nIt is, nevertheless, interesting to compare the relative\ncontributions of \u03c1h and \u03c1\u22c6 = \u03a5\u22c6 j(r) to the total mass\ndensity \u03c1. Depending on the values of the parameters\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, x0 ), the two components may furnish comparable\ncontributes to \u03c1 for medium radii (x around 1 or few\nunits), while, as expected, it is the dark matter halo to\ndominate the outer mass budget. Nevertheless, given the\nway we have assigned the model, the dark matter density\nhas the same asymptotic behaviours of the total one, i.e.\n\u03c1h \u221d x\u03b1\u2212\u03b3 for x \u2192 0 and \u03c1h \u221d x\u03b1+\u03b2\u22123 for x \u2192 \u221e, thus\n\nthe inner slope of the dark matter density is determined\nby the luminous component through the value of \u03b3. As a\nconsequence, the constraints on the model parameters \u03b1\nand \u03b3 provide information about the competition between\nthe luminous and dark matter of galaxies, especially in the\ninner regions where the baryons are supposed to be dominating (Mamon & Lokas 2005a).\n\n3.5. Local M/L ratio\nA general comment is in order here. Eq. (1) defines the\nM/L ratio as M (r)/L(r). This is also referred to in literature as global M/L ratio, while the quantity \u03a5loc (r) =\n\u03c1(r)/j(r), with \u03c1(r) and j(r) the mass and luminosity density, is dubbed local M/L ratio.\nNow it is interesting to compute the local M/L ratio\nas :\n\u03a5loc (x) \u2261\n\n\u03a5(x)P(x)\n\u03c1(x)\n=\n.\nj(x)\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)x0 (1 + x/x0 )\n\n(19)\n\nApart the constant numerical factor (that is positive definite for \u03b3 < 3), the local M/L ratio is similar to the global\nM/L ratio, but is no more a double power law because\nof the multiplicative term P(x)/(1 + x/x0 ). Note that,\nin the inner regions (x << 1), both \u03a5(x) and \u03a5loc (x)\nscale as x\u03b1 . On the other hand, the behaviour at infinity is radically different. To this end, let us note that,\nfor x >> 1, \u03a5loc scales as x\u03b1+\u03b2+1 , whereas Eq.(2) shows\nthat \u03a5 \u221d x\u03b1+\u03b2 . As a consequence, models with finite total mass (i.e. \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0) have an asymptotically constant\nglobal M/L ratio, while a divergent local M/L ratio. We\nthus argue in favour of using \u03a5 rather \u03a5loc in order to\navoid any disturbing divergence.\n\n3.6. Comparison with a generalized NFW profile\nIt is interesting to compare our phenomenological ansatz\nfor the M/L ratio with that coming out from an assumed\ndark halo model. To this aim, describing in both cases\nthe luminosity component with a Dehnen model, we have\nto choice a dark matter density profile among the various\nproposals available in literature. Motivated by the results\nof a wide set of numerical N - body simulations, it is customary to model dark halos through the so called NFW\nmodel whose mass density profile reads (Navarro et al.\n1996,1997) :\n\u03c1N F W (r) = \u03c1s\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrh\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\u22122\nr\n1+\n,\nrh\n\n(20)\n\nwhere rh and \u03c1s scaling values for the radius and the\ndensity. Following the common practice, it is more convenient to parametrize the model by the virial mass Mv\nand the concentration c = rv /rs with rv the virial radius. As it is easily seen, \u03c1N F W asymptotically scales\nas r\u22121 and r\u22123 in the inner and outer regions respectively. While there is a wide consensus on the value of\n\n\fC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nthe outer slope, a fierce debate is still open on the inner scaling with values as high as 1.5 (Moore et al. 1998,\nGhigna et al. 2000, Fukushige & Makino 2001). As a consequence, it is more instructive to consider the generalized\nNFW (gNFW) model defined as :\n\u03c1gN F W (r) = \u03c1s\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrh\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b4 \u0012\n\u0013\u03b4\u22123\nr\n1+\n,\nrh\n\n(21)\n\nwhich reduces to the NFW model for \u03b4 = 1, while \u03b4 = 1.5\nreproduces the results obtained by Moore et al. (1998).\nNote that the total mass is formally infinite, but, as usual,\nwe truncate the model at the virial radius and take Mv as\nfinite total mass.\nIn the rest of this section, we will compare the M/L\nratio and the mass density profile of our effective galaxy\nwith the same properties of a real galaxy modelled with a\nDehnen - like luminous component and a gNFW halo. For\nillustrative purposes, we also consider the case of a single gNFW component although this leads to less reliable\nresults in the inner baryon dominated regions.\n\n3.6.1. M/L ratio comparison\nThe global M/L ratio for the gNFW + Dehnen (hereafter gNFW+D) models may be easily computed as\n\u03a5gN F W +D = [MgN F W + \u03a5\u22c6 L(r)]/L(r), while for the\ngNFW only model it is simply \u03a5gN F W = MgN F W /L(r).\nDepending on the values of (\u03b3, \u03b4), we can have different variation of \u03a5gN F W +D with r. For instance, if \u03b4 > \u03b3,\n\u03a5gN F W +D presents a mimimum and increases outwards,\nwhile in the inner region may eventually diverge. Similar\ntrends may be observed also for \u03a5gN F W which is not surprising given that \u03a5gN F W +D (r) = \u03a5\u22c6 + \u03a5gN F W (r). Our\nphenomenological ansatz for \u03a5(r) in Eq.(1) presents similar characteristics with \u03b1 playing the role of \u03b4. In particular, models with \u03b1 < 0 presents a minimum and may be\ndivergent at the centre.\nThe similar role played by \u03b1 and \u03b4 may be well understood considering the asymptotic trends of \u03a5gN F W +D and\n\u03a5gN F W . First, when \u03b3 < \u03b4, for r \u2192 0 both \u03a5gN F W +D and\n\u03a5gN F W scales as r\u03b3\u2212\u03b4 so that both quantities diverge. On\nthe other hand, if \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b4, we get \u03a5gN F W +D (0) = \u03a5\u22c6 , while\n\u03a5gN F W (0) = 0. In the opposite limit, for r \u2192 \u221e, we get\n\u03a5gN F W +D = \u03a5gN F W = Mtot /Ltot , i.e. an asymptotically\nconstant value.\nOur ansatz for \u03a5 scales as r\u03b1 in the inner regions and\nas r\u03b1+\u03b2 in the outer ones, being therefore able to recover\nthe trends of gNFW+D and gNFW models. For instance,\nin the case of gNFW+D model, the inner slope is recovered for \u03b1 = \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4 or \u03b1 = 0 depending on the \u03b3 being\nsmaller or larger than \u03b4, while an asymptotically constant\nvalue is obtained for \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 4 . Our model can reproduce asymptotically both flat M/L (for \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0) and\n4\n\nWe note that the gNFW model, also being able to reproduce observed flat rotation curve, has a total finite mass and\ntherefore an asymptotically flat M/L ratio. However, this is\nnot a serious shortcoming such a profile, since only the be-\n\n7\n\nincreasing M/L (for \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1) giving more possibilities\nrespect to the gNFW.\n\n3.6.2. Mass density comparison\nFor what concerns the mass density, the NFW+Dehnen\nmodel presents the following trends\n\uf8f1 \u2212\u03b4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 r\u2212\u03b3 for\n\uf8f2\nr\nfor\n\u03c1gN F W +D (r) \u221d\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u22123\nr\nfor\n\nr \u2192 0 and \u03b4 \u2265 \u03b3\nr \u2192 0 and \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b3\n\n(22)\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nThe gNFW model has the same value for the outer slope,\nwhile \u03c1gN F W \u221d r\u2212\u03b4 for r \u2192 0.\nSince the mass density of our effective model scales as\nr\u03b1\u2212\u03b3 for r \u2192 0, we are able to recover the same inner\nasymptotic trends of the gNFW+D and gNFW model by\nsuitably choosing \u03b1. Considering the case \u03b3 = 1, the choice\n\u03b1 = 0 gives \u03c1 \u221d r\u22121 as for the NFW model (\u03b4 = 1),\nwhile for \u03b1 = \u22120.5 we get the Moore model (\u03b4 = 1.5).\nPositive values of \u03b1 do not recover the trend of gNFW+D\nmodel, since in this case \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u01eb with \u01eb \u2208 [0, 1), and\n\u03c1gN F W +D \u221d r\u22121 . In the case of gNFW model, assuming\n\u03b3 = 1, the models with \u03b4 > 1 (< 1) are recovered when \u03b1 is\nnegative (positive). Finally, we note that, once \u03b1 has been\nset in order to recover the same inner asymptotic trend\nof a given gNFW+D model, the outer r\u22123 scaling may\nbe recovered by setting \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1 since our mass density\nscales as r\u03b1+\u03b2\u22123 in these regions (as stated above when\nwe analyzed the M/L ratio).\n\n4. Dynamical quantities\nAfter having evaluated the main properties of the mass\nmodel, we determine here some useful dynamical quantities. In a first step, we derive the gravitational potential discussing its main properties. From an observational\npoint of view, however, the rotation curve and the velocity\ndispersion are more appealing quantities since they can be\ncompared to the observed data in order to investigate the\nviability of our parametrization of the M/L ratio.\n\n4.1. Gravitational potential\nAlthough not explicitly needed to evaluate the dynamical quantities of interest, it is nonetheless useful to compute the gravitational potential for the\nmodel we are considering.

Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nthat is more stringent than Eq.(7). We consider as physically motivated those models having an asymptotically\nflat or decreasing rotation curve. Thus, using Eq. (31), we\nobtain the constraint in Eq. (28).\nIn particular, models with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0 presents a keplerian falloff of the rotation curve consistent with the finite\ntotal mass, while vc is asymptotically flat when \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1\nwith :\nvc (\u221e, \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1) =\n\nr\n\n9\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n\u0392\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\nG\u03a50 Ltot\n.\nax0\n\nThe qualitative dependence of vc on the parameters\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, x0 ) may be derived by Fig. 2 where we plot the\nscaled circular velocity vs \u2261 vc (x)/vc (x = 1) for some\nrepresentative choices of the parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, x0 ) and setting \u03b3 = 1. In the top left panel, we present models having\nfinite total mass (i.e., with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0) thus showing a keplerian falloff of the rotation curve. The top right panel,\ninstead, refers to models with asymptotically flat rotation\ncurve that is with \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1 = 0 corresponding to a M/L\nratio that is still increasing beyond the visible edge of the\ngalaxy as in presence of a dark matter halo. In both cases,\nfor a given x, vc is a decreasing or increasing function of \u03b2\ndepending on x being larger or lower than 1 respectively.\nThe situation is reversed when considering the dependence\non \u03b1 with the higher values of \u03b1 leading to larger (smaller)\ncircular velocities in the regime x > 1 (x < 1). The role\nof \u03b2 is further investigated in the bottom left panel where\nwe hold \u03b1 fixed and change \u03b2 showing that this slope\nparameter determines the transition from asymptotically\ndecreasing to asymptotically flat rotation curves. In particular, models with flat rotation curves rotate faster than\nthose with a keplerian falloff. Finally, in the bottom right\npanel, we investigate the dependence on the scaling radius\nx0 finding out that the larger is x0 , the lower is vc (x). It is\nworth noting that the wide variety of cases is an evidence\nof the extreme versatility of the adopted parametrization\neven if this originates degeneracies among the parameters\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, x0 ) that may not be disentangled with observations\nof the rotation curve only.\nCombining all the constraints obtained insofar on\nmodel parameters, we end up with the following range\nfor \u03b1 :\nmax (\u03b3 \u2212 2, \u2212\u03b2) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 min (\u03b3, 1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\n-1\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nwhich we have graphically summarized in Fig. 3 for models\nwith \u03b3 = 1.\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\u0391\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFig. 3.

The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3 are crucial\nin this analysis, in particular to determine the low radii\ntrend of the surface mass density.

In Fig. 5 we plot \u2206\u03c3s as a function of\n1\n\u03bcOM \u2261 xOM\n. Although the results are more complicated,\nit is nevertheless clear that also in this case the anisotropy\nintroduces large changes in the velocity dispersion. \u2206\u03c3s\nconverges to 0 for high xOM (low \u03bcOM ) and assumes saturated and very high values for low xOM (high \u03bcOM ).\n\n4.3.2. Projected velocity dispersion\nThe velocity dispersion defined by Eq.(35) is not directly\nmeasurable. Indeed, when comparing to observations, we\nhave to take into account some effects. First, the line of\nsight does not coincide with the radial direction so that\nwe measure only the projection of the velocity dispersion\nalong the line of sight. Moreover, all the galaxy elements\ncontribute to the measured \u03c3, but the more luminous is\nthe element, the larger will be its contribution to the observed quantity. As such, we have first to define the velocity dispersion projected along the line of sight and luminosity weighted. Denoting by \u03c3los this quantity, it is\n(Binney & Tremaine 1987) :\n2\n\u03c3los\n\n2\n=\nI(R)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nR\n\n\u221a\nGM (r) r2 \u2212 R2\ndr\nj(r)\nr2\n\n(45)\n\nwith I(R) the luminosity intensity.\nAs a second step, we have to take into account the\nseeing that makes the intrinsic intensity differs from the\nobserved one. We therefore define the seeing corrected velocity dispersion as :\nR 2 \u2032\nd R P (R \u2212 R\u2032 )I(R\u2032 )\u03c3p2 (R\u2032 )\n2\nR\n,\n(46)\n\u03c3seeing (R) =\nd2 R\u2032 P (R \u2212 R\u2032 )I(R\u2032 )\n\nwhere P (R \u2212 R\u2032 ) is the point spread function taking into\naccont both the atmospheric and the instrument seeing.\n\n\fC.

Normalized deflection angle \u03b1s (left) and lensing potential \u03c8s (right) as function of \u03be. The model parameters\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, x0 ) are set as in the inset of each panel, while \u03b3 = 1 is used for the luminosity profile.\nFinally, we have to consider the effect of the spatial binning and the finite width of the slit used to make the\nmeasurements.

We do not investigate these observational effects\nsince they are strictly related to the observational setup.\nWe, however, stress the need to carefully take into account\nthese corrective terms in order to not introduce systematic\nerrors when comparing the model to the data.\n\n5. Gravitational lensing\nConsidered at its early beginning a little more than a\nscientific curiosity, gravitational lensing has now given\nrise to what may be referred to as lensing astronomy.\nBeing directly dependent on the mass rather than the\nlight distribution, gravitational lensing has turn out to\nbe an invaluable tool to investigate the total density\nprofile in early type galaxies at intermediate and high\nredshift. The lensing observable quantities (such as the\nposition of the images and their flux ratios) in multiply imaged sources (quasars or galaxies) make it possible to constrain the mass profile. Combining lensing reconstruction with a measurement of the velocity dispersion helps breaking degeneracies inherent in lens modeling\nthus shedding a powerful light on their dark matter content (Treu & Koopmans 2002a, Treu & Koopmans 2004).\nUnderstanding the mass distribution of the lens plays a\n\nkey role also in the determination of the Hubble constant H0 through the time delay method (Refsdal 1964).\nIn particular, Kochanek (2002) has shown that the predicted delay between two images, and hence the derived\nvalue of H0 , is primarily governed by the average surface\nmass density in the annulus defined by their radial distances from the lens center with a small correction taking\ninto account the slope of the profile in this annulus. A\ncareful determination of mass profile is therefore mandatory to get a reliable estimate of H0 and hence of the\ndistance scale. Lens modeling plays a vital role also in\ncosmological applications of gravitational lensing. Since\nearly - type galaxies are expected to represent at least 80%\nof lenses (Turner et al. 1984, Fukugita & Turner 1991), a\ncorrect description of their luminous and dark component\nis an essential ingredient in every attempt to constrain cosmological parameters through statistics of lens systems.\nMotivated by these considerations, we complement our\npresentation of our new phenomenological model by a detailed investigation of its lensing properties.\n\n5.1. Deflection angle and lensing potential\nFor a spherically symmetric model, the deflection angle \u03b1\u0302\nmay be easily computed as :\nZ\n2a \u03be\n\u03ba(u)udu = \u03b1\u03021 \u00d7\u03b1s (\u03be; p)\n(48)\n\u03b1\u0302(\u03be) =\n\u03be 0\n\nwhere the normalized deflection angle \u03b1s depends on the\ndimensionless radius \u03be = R/a and the model parameters p = (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, x0 ), while \u03b1\u03021 is the value of the deflection angle for \u03be = 1. The normalized surface mass\n\n\f12\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\ndensity \u03ba is defined as the ratio \u03a3/\u03a3crit between the\nsurface mass density \u03a3 and the critical surface density\n\u03a3crit \u2261 c2 Ds /(4\u03c0GDd Dds ) with Ds , Dd and Dds the\nsource, lens and lens - source angular diameter distances7 .\nAlthough quite complicated analytical expression are\npossible for \u03b1s , we prefer to not report them here and\ndiscuss the results looking at the left panels in Fig. 6. In\nparticular, in the top left panel, we consider models with\nan inner core (\u03b1 = 0) and find out that the larger is \u03b2,\nthe higher (the lower) is the deflection angle for \u03be > 1\n(\u03be < 1). Note that, in the outer regions, \u03b1s (\u03be) is always\nlarger than what is predicted by a constant M/L model.\nIn the bottom left panel, we show the effect of changing\n\u03b1 while holding \u03b2 fixed. It turns out that increasing \u03b1\nstrongly lowers the deflection angle in the outer regions\n(\u03be > 1) with only a minor effect for \u03be < 1. These trends\nare consistent with the asymtptotic scalings \u03b1s \u221d \u03be \u03b1\u2212\u03b3+2\nfor \u03be << 1 and \u03b1s \u221d \u03be \u03b1+\u03b2\u22121 for \u03be >> 1. Note that, as\nexpected, for models with finite total mass (\u03b1+\u03b2 = 0), we\nget \u03b1s \u221d 1/\u03be as for a point mass lens. Finally, we note that\n\u03b1s is an increasing function of x0 which can be explained\nby noting that the larger is x0 , the more the model is\nconcentrated and hence more mass is within a circle with\nradius \u03be and hence the larger is the deflection angle.\nThe spherical symmetry of the model makes it possible to straightforwardly compute the lensing potential\nintegrating the deflection angle thus obtaining :\nZ\n\u03c8 = a \u03b1\u0302(\u03be)d\u03be = \u03c81 \u00d7\u03c8s (\u03be; p)\n(49)\nwith \u03c8s the scaled potential and \u03c81 = \u03c8(\u03be = 1). The\ncomplete expression of \u03c8s is too cumbersome and will be\nnot reported here. However, we plot \u03c8s as a function of \u03be\nfor some representative models in the right panels of Fig. 6\nshowing that \u03c8s is an increasing function of \u03b2. For \u03be \u2192 0,\n\u03c8s \u221d \u03be \u03b1\u2212\u03b3+3 , while \u03c8s \u221d \u03be \u03b1+\u03b2 as \u03be \u2192 \u221e. Note that both\nthese trends should be derived directly from those of \u03b1s\ngiven how \u03b1s and \u03c8s are related.\nThe deflection potential is an essential ingredient to\nwrite down the time delay function and hence estimate\nthe time delay between the images in the multiply imaged quasars. Adopting polar coordinates (R, \u03b8) in the\nlens plane with \u03b8 measured counterclockwise from North,\nit is :\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 2\n\u22121\n2 1 2\n\u03be \u2212\u03be \u03bes cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8s )+ \u03bes \u2212\u03c8(\u03be, \u03b8) , (50)\n\u2206t = h \u03c4100 a\n2\n2\nwhere (\u03be, \u03b8) and (\u03bes , \u03b8s ) are the images and source positions, h the dimensionless Hubble constant and \u03c4100 =\n(1+zd)/c\u00d7Dd Ds /Dds with zd the lens redshift. According\nto the Fermat principle, the images form at the extrema\nof the time delay function so that the lens equations are :\n\u03be \u2212 \u03bes cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s ) =\n7\n\n\u03b1\u0302(\u03be)\n,\na\n\n(51)\n\nIn the rest of the paper we adopt the flat concordance\n\u039bCDM model with (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b , h) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.72) consistent\nwith the WMAP measurements (Spergel et al. 2003).\n\n\u03bes sin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s ) = 0 .\n\n(52)\n\nEq.(52) reduces to an identity for \u03bes = 0, i.e. the lens and\nthe source are perfectly aligned. In this case, the image\nis the well known Einstein ring with radius obtained by\nsolving Eq.(51) for \u03bes = 0. Alternatively, Eq.(52) is solved\nby \u03b8 = \u03b8s + n\u03c0 with n = 0, 1. Inserting these values in\nEq.(51) and solving with respect to \u03be, we get three images.\nTwo of them are disposed symmetrically with respect to\nthe lens centre, while the third one lies very close to the\ncentre (with \u03be \u2243 0) and turns out to be unobservable.\nA quantitative investigation of the time delay function\nis shown in Fig. 7. In the left panel, we plot \u2206t as function\nof the radial distance r for different values of the model\nparameters. Note that, as expected, the function \u2206t(r) has\na maximum and two minimum thus meaning that three\nimages are formed. In the right panels, r is held fixed and\nwe plot \u2206t as function of \u03b2 for different values of \u03b1. An\nimage forming at r will be more and more delayed as \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 get higher. A detailed analysis of the dependence of \u2206t\non the model parameters is quite complicate because of the\nmany parameters involved (including the source position)\nso that will be not performed here.\n\n5.2. Lens ellipticity and contribution of the shear\nReal galaxies are hardly spherically symmetric. An easy\nway to take into account the ellipticity of the lens should\nbe to insert it by hand in the lensing potential replacing\nthe cylindrical dimensionless\nradius \u03be with its elliptical\np\ncounterpart m\u0303 = \u03be12 + \u03be22 /q 2 with q the axial ratio. A\nstill simpler approach is to add an external shear to the\nlensing potential since it has been shown that an elliptical\npotential \u03c8(m\u03032 ) with an on axis shear \u03b3s and axial ratio q\nproduce the same image configuration as a pure elliptical\npotential with an axial ratio q \u2032 = q[(1\u2212\u03b3s )/(1+\u03b3s )]1/2 and\nno shear (Witt 1996). Moreover, an external shear could\nalso mimic the effect of tidal perturbations from nearby\ngalaxies or departures from a smooth distribution because\nof substructures in the primary lens. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, we add the shear term :\n1\n\u03c8\u03b3s = \u2212 \u03b3s a2 \u03be 2 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3s )\n2\n\n(53)\n\nto the lensing potential \u03c8 being (\u03b3s , \u03b8\u03b3s ) the shear strength\nand direction.\nThe main effect of the shear is to alter the shape of\nthe critical curves, defined as the loci in the lens plane\nwhere the magnification formally diverges. In particular,\nnot considering the radial critical curve, the higher is \u03b3s ,\nthe larger is the deformation of the tangential critical\ncurve. In the case of no shear, this curve coincides with the\nEinstein ring, while, for \u03b3s 6= 0, we have to distinguish two\nclosed curve: the first one elongated along the direction of\nthe shear itself (the critical curve) and the other one in\nperpendicular direction (the Einstein ring). Moreover, the\nlarger is \u03b3s , the lower will be the axial ratio b/a between\nthe shortest and the longest axis of these ellipses.\n\n\fC.

Model parameters\nare set as (\u03b1, \u03a50 , x0 ) = (\u22120.3, 5.0, 1.0) and three values of \u03b2 are considered, namely \u03b2 = 0.8 (solid), \u03b2 = 1.0 (long\ndashed), \u03b2 = 1.2 (short dashed).

The bold continue line is the critical curve and the corresponding caustic\nis the astroid (dashed bold curve at center); the internal lighter continue ellipse is the radial critical curve and the\ncorresponding caustic is the dashed lighter ellipse. In both the panel we set \u03b1 = \u22120.3, \u03a50 = 5, \u03b8s = 20\u25e6 , \u03b3s = 0.15\nand \u03b8\u03b3s = 180\u25e6 .\n\n5.3. Image formation\nAs quoted above, the axisymmetric lens can produce only\n2 images with in addition a central (observationally not\nvisible) one. When we distort the lensing isopotential contours by adding the shear term, the shape of tangential\ncritical curves changes and the point - like caustic unfolds\ngenerating four cusps (Schneider, Ehlers & Falco 1992). It\nis interesting to discuss the formation of the images as a\nfunction of some of the model parameters for the case with\nthe shear term included.\nIn Fig. 8, we plot the image configuration for some values of the parameters and changing \u03b2 or rs . We can see\nhow the model can generate 3 or 5 images (2 or 4 plus\n\na central image). In the left panel, we fix the source position and change the values of \u03b2 finding that the radial\ncoordinate of the image increases with \u03b2. The right panel\nshows, for a fixed \u03b2, how the number and the position of\nthe images change with the source position rs . Increasing\nrs two of the images approach each other in direction of\nthe tangential critical curve, until the source exits the region delimited by the tangential caustic curve (the central\nastroid) when the two images merge and the system passes\nfrom a 5 - images to a 3 - images configuration. The other\ntwo curves in figure represents the radial critical curve and\nthe corresponding caustic.\n\n\f14\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nThe number of images needs a brief remark. The oddnumber theorem predicts that lenses with a smooth and\nnot singular surface mass density \u03ba(R) which decreases\nfaster than R\u22121 as |R| \u2192 0 necessarily forms an odd number of images. For models with \u03ba diverging for R \u2192 0,\nwe can use a generalized version of the previous theorem\ngiven by Evans & Wilkinson (1998). These authors consider models with an inner cusp and \u03ba \u221d R\u2212n (e.g., NFW\nmodels above described) and distinguish three different\nbehaviours (see Ref. above for major details)\n1. if 0 < n < 1 (weak density cusp), then we observe an\nodd number of images\n2. if 1 < n < 2 (strong density cusp), then we observe an\neven number of images\n3. if n = 1 (isothermal density cusp), then we can observe\nboth an odd or even number of images\nOur model can predict an asymptotically decreasing (flat)\n\u03ba for \u03b3 \u2212 2 < \u03b1 < \u03b3 \u2212 1 (\u03b3 \u2212 1 < \u03b1 < \u03b3). When\n\u03b3 \u2212 2 < \u03b1 < \u03b3 \u2212 1 is n = \u2212(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 + 1) and it is simple to verify that these models belong to the weak density\ncusp class, with 0 < n < 1, thus an odd number of images\nalways exist as observed in Fig. 8 for all the values of \u03b3. In\naddition, when \u03ba is cored (for instance, if \u03b3 \u2212 1 < \u03b1 < \u03b3),\nthen the original odd-number theorem holds and predicts\nalso in this case an odd number of images. Thus, our model\ncannot reproduce strong cusp, predicting for all the possible combinations of the lens parameters an odd number\nof images and the formation of both radial and tangential\ncritical curves (the first one not observed in the case of\nstrong cusp models). Nearly all the observed lenses present\ntwo or four images, thus a discordance appears. However,\nobservations and theoretical predictions can be reconciled\nif the central image is very close to the lens and highly demagnified by the high central surface density, making this\nimage difficult to detect. Actually, central images were observed in the 2-image lens PMN J1632-0033 (Winn et al.\n2003, 2004), therefore the existence of these events can allow to constrain the lens model and particularly the inner\nslope of the mass density.\n\n5.4. Comparison with commonly used lens models\nHaving investigated in detail the lensing properties of our\nphenomenological model, it is worth comparing it with\nsome of the most used models in literature.\nAs a quite general and simple class of models, we consider the power law lensing potential :\n\u03c8(R, \u03b8) = R\u03bd F (\u03b8, q, \u03b8q )\n\n(54)\n\nwhere 0 < \u03bd < 2 is the slope of the radial profile\nand F (\u03b8, q, \u03b8q ) the angular shape function with (q, \u03b8q )\nthe axial ratio and the orientation of the isopotential contours. Eq.(54) represents a generalization of the\nthe pseudo - isothermal elliptical potentials (Kovner 1987,\nKassiola & Kovner 1995) that have been designed to\nbe as similar as possible to the pseudo - isothermal\n\nmass distribution models (Blandford & Kochanek 1987,\nKassiola & Kovner 1995). Given their easy manageability,\nthey have been widely used in literature. For semianalytical and/or numerical treatments in modeling lensed\nquasars see, e.g., Cardone et al. (2001, 2002), Tortora et\nal. (2004). In addition, considering that \u03ba \u221d R\u03bd\u22122 and\nfollowing the previous Sec., power law with 0 < \u03bd < 1\n(1 < \u03bd < 2) have strong (weak) cusp.\nIt is worth stressing that the models defined by Eq.(54)\nare characterized by a constant radial slope of the lensing potential. Obviously, this is not the case for our phenomenological model. Nevertheless, we can match the two\nmodels in the inner regions by setting \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 + 3 = \u03bd. In\nparticular, for \u03b3 = 1 and \u03be \u2192 0, our model reproduces\nthe pseudo - isothermal trend for \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22121, 0] thus excluding the region (0, 1], since for these values of \u03b1 is \u03bd > 2\nand the pseudo - isothermal models generate a non physical surface mass density. It is possible to match the outer\nslope imposing \u03b1 + \u03b2 = \u03bd: also in this case the matching\nis not complete since when \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 1 our models are not\ndefined, on the contrary the models in Eq. (54) holds also\nfor \u03bd \u2208 (1, 2]8 .\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been the first\nobservational cornerstone of the dark matter theory. The\nnature and the distribution of this unseen component of\ngalaxies are still obscure, but more and more evidences\nhave been accumulated in favour of its ubiquitous presence. Nonetheless, this picture is far to be free of its own\nproblems since recent observations of line of sight velocity profile of elliptical galaxies have furnished contrasting evidences favoring or disfavoring the presence of significant amounts of dark matter in the outer regions of\nthese systems. In an attempt to face this problem we have\nemployed here a phenomenological approach assuming a\ndouble power law expression for the global M/L ratio as\n\u03a5(r) = \u03a50 (r/r0 )\u03b1 (1 + r/r0 )\u03b2 . This simple parametrization reduces to constant M/L models for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 0),\nwhile gives an asymptotically increasing M/L ratio for\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2265 0 as in models with dominating dark matter\ncomponent. Adopting spherical symmetry and a versatile\nexpression for the luminosity density j(r), it is possible\nto build a wide class of (effective) galaxy models starting from the mass profile M (r) = \u03a5(r)L(r). Varying the\nmodel parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) in the range determined by some\nphysical considerations makes it possible to mimic a wide\nrange of models having finite (\u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0) or formally\ninfinite (\u03b1 + \u03b2 > 0) total mass, cuspy (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 < 0) or\ncored (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 = 0) density profiles, asymptotically flat\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1 = 0) or decreasing (\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1 < 0) rotation\ncurve, cuspy (\u03b3 \u2212 2 < \u03b1 < \u03b3 \u2212 1) or cored (\u03b3 \u2212 1 < \u03b1 < \u03b3)\nsurface mass density.\n8\n\nThis circumstance is verified since we required that our\nmodel never has an increasing vc (giving the constraint \u03b1+\u03b2 <\n1), on the contrary models (54) predict both decreasing and\nincreasing vc .\n\n\fC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nThe main advantage of our parametrization of the\nM/L model is therefore the possibility to reproduce a wide\nphenomenology resorting to a simple analytical expression and relying on phenomenological considerations only\nthus avoiding any theoretical prejudice or systematic errors related to convergence problems in numerical N - body\nsimulations of structure formation. As a preliminary and\nmandatory step, to allow a future comparison between\ntheoretically predicted and observed properties of early\ntype galaxies, we have here derived the main dynamical\nand lensing quantities of the model giving whenever possible analytical expressions or illustrative plots. We have\npayed a particular attention to the asymptotic trends in\nthe inner and outer regions since both these regimes are\nmostly probed by different kind of observations. On the\none hand, measurement of the velocity dispersion profiles\nhardly extends to radii larger than the effective radius Re\nand, indeed, only the central velocity dispersion is often\nat disposal. Such a mass tracer therefore mainly probes\nthe inner region of the system so that knowing how our\nmodel fares for x << 1 helps in comparing with this kind\nof data. In order to probe larger radii, one may resort to\nmultiply imaged lensed quasars. First, the images typically form at r \u223c (1 \u2212 2)Re so that a larger region is\nprobed. Moreover, the lensing potential and the flux ratios also depend on the derivatives of the mass profile thus\nallowing to probe indirectly also outermost regions.\nWe can individuate two main implications. Firstly, we\nhave seen how the the full mass density profile and derived DM profile depend on \u03b3 and therefore on the fitted\nluminous profile. Therefore, the presence of the baryons\ninfluences dark matter profile, since the parameter \u03b3 that\nspecifies the inner slope of the luminous profile enters in\nthe expression of halo profile derived from our model.\nSecondly, we have compared our model with the more\ncommon generalized NFW profile: the asymptotic trends\nhas been compared and we are able with suitable choices\nof \u03b1 and \u03b2 to recover the behaviour of gNFW model. The\nvalue of the inner trend of mass profile has generated a\nlong debate in literature. The simulations seems to indicate an inner trend that scales like r\u2212\u03b4 with \u03b4 \u2265 1 (the so\ncalled cusped models). On the contrary, many results from\nobservational analysis, by rotation curves of low surface\nbrightness, dwarf galaxies and spiral galaxies, dynamical\nstudies of elliptical galaxies and gravitational lensing\n(McGaugh & de Blok 1998,\nBinney & Evans 2001,\nBorriello & Salucci 2001,\nde Blok et al. 2001,\nTreu & Koopmans 2002b, Borriello et al. 2003) suggested the presence of internal core with \u03b4 < 1 (cored\nmodels). This contradiction generates the so called\ncusp/core problem. Our model can reproduce both cuspy\nmodels with \u03b4 \u2265 1 and cored ones with \u03b4 < 1. In details,\n\u03b1 < 0 recovers the first models, i.e. the results from\nsimulations and \u03b1 \u2265 0 the seconde one, those from\nresults of observations. Being able to reproduce all these\ndifferent behaviours, our phenomenological model offers\nthe perspective to homogenously analyze the observations\nand give an answer to the cusp/core problem.\n\n15\n\nOn a theoretical side, our approach could be further\nameliorated. A key ingredient in our modeling is the luminosity density j(r) which we have assumed to be described by the class of Dehnen models. Although this\ngives a quite general expression able to reproduce well\nthe observed surface brightness profile, the ideal route to\nfollow should be to deproject an empirical function obtained by a direct fit to the photometric data. However,\nthis approach should be repeated for each single galaxy\nand thus does not allow to investigate general properties.\nAn intermediate possibility could be to use the deprojection of the Sersic profile as input for the luminosity\ndensity and investigate the dynamical and lensing properties of the corresponding model. Moreover, it has been\nshown that the dynamics of inner regions of elliptical\ngalaxies is better described adding the contribution of the\ncentral supermassive black hole (Baes & Dejonghe 2004,\nMamon & Lokas 2005a, Mamon & Lokas 2005b) so that\nit is interesting to update our parametrization including this term into the mass profile. Finally, departures\nfrom spherical symmetry could also be investigated since\nreal galaxies are likely to be moderately triaxial systems\n(Franx et al. 1994).\nContrasting the model with the observations is, of\ncourse, the best strategy to both test the viability of our\nparametrization and constrain its parameters. Given the\ndifficulties in obtaining radial velocity dispersion profile\nup to large radii, an ideal tool could be represented by\nlens galaxies. With more than 90 observed multiply imaged quasars, gravitational lensing offers a unique dataset\nto put severe constraints on the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nand hence suggest useful hints to solve the problem of dark\nmatter in elliptical galaxies. Moreover, since lens galaxies\nspan a range in redshift from low to intermediate, such an\nanalysis also offers the possibility to investigate whether\nand how the characteristics of the dark matter content of\nearly type galaxies evolve.\nA first qualitative result can be obtained considering\nthe index of the surface mass density defined as ind\u03ba(r) =\nd ln \u03ba/d ln r. In order to shape lensing events with their\nmodel independent analysis, Williams & Saha (2000) have\nused as a constraint on the chosen lens model the condition\nind\u03ba(r) \u2264 \u22120.5 for values of r close to the images positions\nin strongly lensed quasars (see also Tortora et al. 2004).\nSuch a condition ensures that the image magnification is\nless than \u223c 2 which is a quite plausible constraint well\nsatisfied in some real lenses. Considering that typically\nimages forms at (1 \u2212 2)Re , we have checked that the constraints on ind\u03ba(r) is satisfied by our model for all physically reasonable choices of the slope parameters. Although\nthis does not allow to further constrain (\u03b1, \u03b2), this result\nsuggests that our parametrization of the M/L ratio leads\nto a model that correctly reproduces this aspect of the\nobserved lensing phenomenology.\nA detailed investigation of some interesting cases is\noutside our aim here and will be presented in a forthcoming paper. Here, we only note that, although the luminous component parameters (\u03b3, a) may be set from\n\n\f16\n\nC. Tortora et al.: Dynamics and lensing in a phenomenological model for ellipticals\n\nthe analysis of the surface brightness profile, severe degeneracies still exist among the slope parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nand the scaling quantities (\u03a50 , x0 ). As a consequence,\nit is likely that reliable constraints could be obtained\nonly considering bright quadruply imaged systems so that\nthe errors on the image positions is low and the number of constraints higher. Moreover, it is preferable to\nlimit the attention to isolated lens galaxies in order to\navoid to introduce further unknown parameters to describe the lens environment. Finally, it is highly desirable to have a measurement of the central velocity dispersion in order to break some of the degeneracies inherent in lens modeling with the help of dynamical data\n(Treu & Koopmans 2002a, Treu & Koopmans 2004).\nAs a final comment, we would like to stress again the\nneed for a phenomenological approach to the problem of\ndark matter in elliptical galaxies. In order to overcome\nany theoretical prejudice, one should adopt a procedure\nthat matches a large set of observational constraints with\nthe minimal number of hypotheses. Adding gravitational\nlensing data to the dynamical one makes it possible to\nadvance our knowledge on the observational side of the\nproblem. Using phenomenological models like the one we\nhave presented here could be the theoretical ingredient\nbest suited to be coupled to the above data to analyze the\nquestion of dark matter in early-type galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.
