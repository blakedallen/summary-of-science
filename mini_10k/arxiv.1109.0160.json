New photosensitive tools offer the possibility to\nmonitor and control neuronal activity from the sub-cellular to the integrative level. This\nongoing revolution has motivated the development of new optical methods for light\nstimulation. Among them, it has been recently demonstrated that a promising approach is\nbased on the use of wavefront shaping to generate optically confined extended excitation\npatterns. This was achieved by combining the technique of temporal focusing with\ndifferent approaches for lateral light shaping including low numerical aperture Gaussian\nbeams, holographic beams and beams created with the generalized phase contrast\nmethod. What is needed now is a precise characterization of the effect of scattering on\nthese different methods in order to extend their use for in depth excitation.\nHere we present a theoretical and experimental study on the effect of scattering on the\npropagation of wavefront shaped beams. Results from fixed and acute cortical slices\nshow that temporally focused spatial patterns are extremely robust against the effects of\nscattering and this permits their three-dimensional confinement for depths up to 550 \u03bcm.\n\n2\n\n\f\\body\nIntroduction\nThe combination of light microscopy with functional reporters (1-4), caged compounds\nand, more recently, optogenetics (5-7) offers the possibility to control activation and\ninhibition of neuronal activity and monitor functional responses in a non-invasive manner\nenabling the analysis of well-defined neuronal population within intact neuronal circuits\nand systems. Interestingly, those tools have permitted to address key biological questions\nwith relatively simple illumination methods using widefield visible light illumination (1,\n8-11). However, some limitations in the specificity of genetic targeting (different cellular\ntypes can express the same optogenetic channels) and the intricate morphology of the\nbrain (sub-cellular compartments, such as dendrites and axons, can reach regions far\naway from the cell soma), make it challenging to, for example, individuate subsets of\ngenetically identical interconnected cells, or to establish the role of specific\nspatiotemporal excitatory patterns in guiding animal behavior. To reach such degree of\nspecificity, more sophisticated illumination methods are required, permitting control of\nlight patterning deep inside tissue. In this respect the use of visible light illumination is\nproblematic due to the lack of optical sectioning and, for scattering samples, the low\npenetration depth.\nTwo-photon (2P) excitation mitigates the effects of scattering due to the longer\nexcitation wavelength and permits superior axial resolution due to the nonlinear\ndependence of the absorption probability on the excitation intensity. However, a major\ndrawback in the use of 2P photoactivation is that the number of activatable\nmolecules/channels within the small excitation volume of a standard 2P diffractionlimited spot (1-3 \u03bcm3) might be insufficient e.g. to generate an action potential (12-14) or\na detectable fluorescence signal from genetic reporters.\nSeveral solutions have been recently proposed to this issue. One is based on increasing\nthe excitable areas using low numerical aperture (NA) beams focused on a single spot\n(12) or scanned through multiple locations (13). However, the rapid loss of axial and, for\nscanning, temporal resolution limits their use to small excitation areas. To increase the\nexcitation area without affecting the axial resolution, alternative solutions including static\nbeam multiplexing (15) or low-NA temporally focused (16) Gaussian beams have been\n3\n\n\fdemonstrated (17). However these approaches are limited to fixed excitation patterns.\nIncreased flexibility to generate, for example, excitation patterns adapted to the shape of\na sub-cellular compartment, or to cover multiple cell somata can be reached by quick\nscanning of a temporally focused beam (17, 18). However, in this case a compromise has\nto be found between axial resolution and scanning time.\nAlternative to these approaches full parallel methods for scanless multiscale excitation\nhave been demonstrated. The first one, originally proposed for optical tweezers (19) and\nthen for patterned 1P uncaging (20-22), consists in using the principle of digital\nholography (DH). With this approach, dynamical reconfiguration of the optical wavefront\nallows efficient multiple-scale excitation going from single to multiple diffraction limited\nspots, to shapes covering a single subcellular process or a large population of sparse\nneurons. In 2P excitation this approach combined with TF allowed to reach an axial\nresolution of few \u03bcm independently of the excitation pattern (23-25).\nAn alternative approach for lateral light patterning is based on the technique of the\ngeneralized phase contrast (GPC) (26). The main advantage of GPC is to avoid spatial\nintensity fluctuations, which are intrinsic to DH (27). With this approach combined with\nTF, 2P depth-resolved speckle-free arbitrary patterns can be generated and efficient 2P\nexcitation of ChR2 in cultured neurons and brain slices could be demonstrated (28).\nOverall these results show that enhanced 2P photoactivation of optogenetic actuators\nand reporters can be reached by using extended axially confined excitation patterns (29).\nThese can be generated by using two complementary approaches based on serial or\nparallel excitation. Both methodologies have limits and advantages and each of them\nmight prove to be best suited for different experimental configuration. For parallel\napproaches, a fundamental question that still needs to be answered, in order to be fully\ncharacterized, is how wave-shaped beams (low-NA Gaussian beams, holographic and\nGPC generated temporally focused beams) propagate deep into scattering media.\nRecently, Dana et al. (30) have compared the propagation in scattering tissue of a lowNA Gaussian beam with TF to that of tightly focused Gaussian beams. Using both Monte\nCarlo simulations and experiments they found that axial sectioning provided by TF\ndeteriorates more rapidly with propagation depth than in 2P line-scanning microscopy.\nYet, it permits a reasonably good optical sectioning also for low-NA beams.\n4\n\n\fPerhaps even more important than the effect of scattering on the axial resolution is its\neffect on the predetermined shape of the excitation pattern. Generally, scattering turns a\nhomogeneously illuminated region into a speckled pattern. Yet, when photoexciting\nthrough turbid tissues, it is of utmost importance to maintain the spatial shape of the\nexcitation beam.\nIn this paper, we explore the propagation through fixed and acute brain slices of lowNA Gaussian beams, holographic and GPC generated temporally focused beams. We\nshow that TF excitation does not only maintain a reasonable degree of axial confinement\nthrough scattering tissue, but is also relatively robust against scattering, maintaining the\ngeneral spatial excitation profile irrespective of the particular realization of scattering\ninside the sample. This enables accurate and controlled photoexcitation of predetermined\nvolumes up to hundreds of microns deep into scattering specimens.\nResults\nTheoretical modeling\nIn order to elucidate the evolution of temporally focused beams inside turbid tissue, we\nstart by considering the results of numerical simulations of light propagation within a\nscattering phantom. In the simulations, we used 100 fs pulses centered at either 800 nm\nor 950 nm, as in the experiments performed on biological preparations. As a scattering\nsample, we consider a homogeneous medium in which dielectric spheres of 2 \u03bcm in\ndiameter, having a refractive index higher by 0.1 than the surrounding medium and an\naverage concentration of 1 scatterer per 1000 \u03bcm3, are randomly distributed.\nIn Figure 1, we compare the 800 nm 2P excitation pattern generated at the focal plane\nof the focusing lens after propagation through 200 \u03bcm of the turbid sample\n(corresponding to approximately 1.5 effective scattering lengths, as defined by the\nintegrated signal decay exponent (31)) for three different techniques of generation of the\nexcitation pattern: a low-NA Gaussian beam (Fig. 1a) with a full width at half-maximum\n(FWHM) of 7 \u03bcm, a 10 \u03bcm circular spot generated with GPC (Fig. 1b) and a 10 \u03bcm\ncircular spot generated with DH (Fig. 1c). For comparison, the left column shows the\nexcitation pattern without scattering. The middle column shows the excitation pattern\nwith scattering but without TF, while in the right column we plot the excitation pattern\n5\n\n\fwith TF. Evidently, standard illumination (no TF) results in significant speckle, hardly\nreminiscent of the original shape for either the Gaussian excitation pattern or the GPCgenerated spot. The situation is slightly better in the case of the holographic beam, since\nwe already start with a speckled intensity distribution with this technique. In contrast,\ntemporally focused excitation yields relatively smooth 2P excitation patterns, particularly\nalong the x-axis (along which, colors are dispersed). This observation is, again, more\nevident in the case of originally homogeneous excitation patterns (Gaussian, Fig. 1a, and\nGPC beams Fig. 1b), as compared with holographic illumination (Fig. 1c), where the\neffect is partially suppressed by the existence of inherent speckles.\nThe simulations thus suggest that TF significantly reduces the distortion of\nmultiphoton excitation patterns when illuminating through scattering tissue. In the\nfollowing, we set out to show this experimentally for photoexcitation through brain slice\nsamples, and also consider the effect of scattering on the degree of axial confinement of\nphotoexcitation in these samples.\nPropagation of low-NA Gaussian beams\nTo evaluate the scattering effect experimentally, we first tested the propagation of lowNA Gaussian beams through brain slices of different thickness by using a \"double\nmicroscope\" configuration (Fig. 2a and Methods). We excited fluorescence at 800 nm on\na thin fluorescent layer through fixed slices of 50-250 \u03bcm thickness. In Figure 2b, we\nshow the fluorescence images obtained by using a Gaussian beam of 11 \u03bcm FWHM\nwhen the beam is directly imaged on the fluorescent layer (left panel) and when it\npropagates through a brain slice of 250 \u03bcm thickness, without (middle panel) and with TF\n(right panel). Clearly, the experimental results resemble the numerical simulation\npredictions (Fig. 1a): in the absence of TF, the excitation pattern ends up with large\nspeckles whose position varied with the location on the slice, whereas the shape for\ntemporally focused beams remains much better preserved. The predicted additional\nsmoothing for TF beams along the x-axis is also visible.\nTo evaluate the effect of scattering on the axial resolution we performed the axial\nscanning (see Methods) of the TF Gaussian beam through different thicknesses of\nscattering tissue and we found, in agreement with the theoretical predictions and the data\n6\n\n\freported by Dana et al. (30), that the axial resolution started to deviate from its value\nwithout scattering (2.7\u00b10.3 \u03bcm) for slice thicknesses of the order of the measured\nscattering length, ls= 170\u00b112 \u03bcm.\nPropagation of GPC beams\nTo characterize the effects of scattering in the case of a GPC beam, we repeated the same\nexperiments as for low-NA Gaussian beams by using a round spot of 15 \u03bcm generated\nwith a GPC optical setup. In Figure 3a, we show how the spot is imaged when it\npropagates through brain tissue. Significant distortion is seen already after 50 \u03bcm of\npropagation without TF and the circular shape is barely visible after 250 \u03bcm. In contrast,\nthe temporally focused GPC beam retained, with incredible precision, the original shape,\neven through 250 \u03bcm of tissue. From the comparison between Figure 2b and Figure 3a\nwe can also see that GPC temporally focused beams retain their form better than\ntemporally focused Gaussian beams. To understand this, one must consider the fact that\ndistortions arise primarily from the interference of weaker scattered waves with the\nstronger unscattered ones, which serve as a \"local oscillator\" to amplify their effect. The\nGaussian illumination pattern is relatively smooth, so that this amplification occurs\nthroughout the entire pattern. In contrast, in the GPC excitation spot, having relatively\nsharp edges, light scattered outside the shape is too weak to induce 2P absorption.\nIn Figure 3b, the experimental (orange dots) values for the axial resolution as a\nfunction of the slice thicknesses are shown, and are in good agreement with the\nsimulation (black dots) prediction. The axial resolution starts to deviate from the one\nmeasured without scattering (2.8\u00b10.1 \u03bcm) for depths near the scattering length, which,\nfor the series of samples used in this case, was ls= 135\u00b112 \u03bcm (Fig. S1a). Scattering for\nsmaller depths, resulted only in an increased signal at the tails of the axial propagation\ncurves (Fig. S1b).\nThe ability of GPC beams to retain with a high precision the original excitation shape\nwas also tested for two patterns containing fine details (Fig. 3c). A first pattern was\ngenerated based on the fluorescence image of a layer V cortical neuron (28) (top) and a\nsecond one on the base of the fluorescence image of a dendritic branch of a Purkinje cell\n(bottom). These results show that temporally focused GPC beams preserved their original\n7\n\n\fform even for fine structures with \u03bcm-precision, in stark contrast with the results\nobtained for GPC beams without TF.\nPropagation of holographic beams\nFinally, we measured the propagation of holographic generated beams, by repeating the\nsame experiments using a round spot of 15 \u03bcm generated with a DH optical setup. We\nfound that, up to a slice thickness of 250 \u03bcm, holographic beams are quite robust against\nscattering even without TF (Fig. 4a,b). Yet, a high axial resolution is only obtained for\nTF-DH (23), exhibiting more or less a similar behavior as in the TF-GPC case.\nIt should be noted, however, that unlike TF-GPC, fine structures generated with DH\nquickly deteriorate upon propagation in the scattering medium (Fig. S2a). What is more\ninteresting in the case of DH is the ability to switch the excitation configuration from\ndiffraction-limited spots to multiple large spots with the advantage in the latter case to\nretain the original shape unaffected by scattering (Fig. S2b).\nSimilar to the results obtained for TF-GPC beams, we found that the axial resolution\nfor temporally focused holographic beams remains almost unchanged with respect to the\nvalue measured without scattering (3.7\u00b10.3 \u03bcm) for thicknesses shorter than the scattering\nlength, ls, and increases of about a factor of 5 for thicknesses of the order of twice the ls.\nAs previously reported (20, 23, 32), holographic beams, even without TF, show\nimproved axial resolution than low-NA Gaussian beams thanks to their particular phase\ndistribution at the back aperture of the objective. We evaluated how this axial behavior is\naffected by scattering in that case, and found that axial resolution is almost unaffected up\nto brain thickness of 250 \u03bcm (Fig. S3).\nPropagation through acute slices\nIn order to characterize the maximum depth at which we can use patterned\nphotostimulation in live tissues, we tested the propagation of GPC and holographic\npatterns through acute cortical brain slices (250-550 \u03bcm thick) prepared from juvenile\nrats. As in the experiments with fixed slices, we studied the effects of scattering on the\nexcitation shape and axial resolution by recording the images on a thin fluorescent layer\nafter propagation through brain slices of different thickness. For these experiments, we\n8\n\n\fused an excitation wavelength at 950 nm, which not only represents the optimal\nexcitation wavelength for ChR2 (13, 17, 28), but should also mitigate the effects of\nscattering due to the longer excitation wavelength, as can be seen in the simulations\nplotted in Figures 3b and 4b.\nIn Figure 5a, we show the images of the GPC excitation pattern shown in Figure 3c\nafter propagation through acute slices of 300 and 550 \u03bcm. Although, as expected the\noverall intensity decreases, the fine structure of the pattern is still preserved after 550 \u03bcm\nof tissue with remarkable accuracy for the temporally focused beam. In contrast, the\noriginal shape is completely lost in absence of TF (Fig. 5a, right panel).\nIn Figure 5b, the same experiment is performed for the propagation of a 15 \u03bcm\nholographic spot. In agreement with the results obtained for fixed slices, DH beams\nappear extremely robust to scattering. TF-DH transmitted shapes exhibit almost no\ndistortion even after 550 \u03bcm, while for DH without TF, the original shape starts to be\naffected at around 300 \u03bcm.\nThe average FWHM values measured for the GPC and holographic patterns are shown\nin Figure 5c. For the GPC beam, the axial resolution has been measured on the part of the\nexcitation shape mimicking the soma or the principal dendrite. In the latter case, we\nfound, as expected, values slightly better than the ones measured on the soma, since fine\nstructures resemble the case where the grating is illuminated with a line, giving an axial\nresolution closer to the point-scanning limit (24).\nOverall these results clearly show the benefits of TF in maintaining axial resolution for\nshaped excitation patterns in scattering media.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have investigated the propagation, through fixed and acute brain slices, of extended\npatterns generated by three different methods: low-NA Gaussian beams, beams generated\nwith the GPC method and holographic beams. For the three configurations, we compared\nthe propagation with and without TF.\nWe also presented a theoretical model based on Fresnel propagation in a scattering\nphantom that reproduces well the experimental transmitted shapes and axial resolution\nfor each of these configurations.\n9\n\n\fOverall, we have found that opposite to standard illumination, TF permits to fully\nmaintain the original lateral shape at least up to 500 \u03bcm. Moreover, the original shape is\nmaintained irrespective of the particular details of the scattering medium. In order to\nunderstand this remarkable difference, one should consider the effect of scattering in the\ncase of multicolor photoexcitation. For standard illumination (no TF), the speckle pattern\nof all the colors comprising the excitation pulse are nearly identical (due to the fact that\nthe spectral bandwidth is much smaller than the carrier wavelength, \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb=0.01 << 1)\n(33). Thus, the excitation pattern practically reflects a single realization of a speckle\npattern generated by the medium.\nFor temporally focused excitation the situation is significantly different. Since\ndifferent excitation colors traverse different paths through the scattering medium, their\nrespective speckle patterns are nearly uncorrelated, providing significant smoothing to\nthe overall 2P response. Moreover, speckle patterns of 'nearby' colors, which partially\ntraverse the same path but at a different propagation direction, are partially correlated but\nspatially shifted along the x-axis. This effect provides additional smoothing along the xaxis, which is apparent in the right column of Figures 1a and 1b. The latter effect (termed\n'Smoothing by Spectral Dispersion' or SSD) has long been used for smoothing out\nspeckle in inertial confinement fusion applications (34). The combined effect leads to\noverall illumination patterns which strongly resemble the original intended shape.\nOverall, these effects lend a self-healing quality to the temporally focused excitation\nprofile.\nIn the case of temporally focused digital holograms, where the excitation pattern is\ninherently speckled (23, 24), the overall shape is also maintained upon the use of TF but\nthe excitation pattern is not smoothed out (see Fig. 1c).\nBy measuring the axial propagation for the three different methods we found, in\nagreement with simulation predictions, that the axial resolution is well maintained for\nthickness of the order of the scattering length, ls. For greater depths, the axial resolution\nstarts to deteriorate reaching a value approximately 5 times larger at 2ls.\nThe comparison between the three different approaches has revealed that among these,\na low-NA Gaussian beam results in a somewhat worse axial resolution. The degree of\n\n10\n\n\fdeterioration is in good agreement with results presented in the study of Dana et al. for\nsimilar experimental conditions (30).\nTF-GPC beams permit to conserve impressively well fine details up to depths of 550\n\u03bcm in acute slices. However in GPC constraints on the excitation density practically limit\nthe maximum achievable excitation field (28). TF-GPC beams therefore represent the\nmost suitable choice for excitation in small fields of view and of fine subcellular\nprocesses. Moreover the absence of speckles allows extending the use of this technique\nfor imaging.\nFor TF-DH beams, the unavoidable presence of speckles makes it difficult to conserve\nfine structures through brain thicknesses greater than 50 \u03bcm. However for uniform shapes\n(single or multiple large spots) the original shape remains basically unaffected after\npropagation through slices of up to 550 \u03bcm. DH beams without TF are also very robust to\nscattering conserving the original shape up to 300 \u03bcm. Interestingly, the axial resolution\nseems to deteriorate somewhat less sharply than for TF-GPC beams and, although\nslightly worse, is well conserved also in the absence of TF. With DH, contrary to GPC,\nlarge excitation fields and efficient multi-scale excitation (from single diffraction-limited\nspots to multiple-cell excitation) are possible using the same optical setup, which makes\nthis configuration the best choice for applications requiring this flexibility.\nTwo existing alternatives to TF for photoexcitation through scattering media are\nBessel beams and the use of adaptive optics. 'Bessel beams' (35) reconstruct their original\nshape regardless of the particular realization of scattering inside the medium and have\nrecently been used for a variety of applications, including particle trapping (36) and lightsheet microscopy (37). However a major disadvantage of these non-diffracting beams, in\nthe context of photostimulation, is the complete absence of optical sectioning (due to the\nlack of diffraction) and that the excitation shape is limited to a circular geometry.\nAdaptive optics provides another alternative for improved propagation through\nscattering samples. Indeed, it has recently been shown that photoexcitation of a\ndiffraction-limited spot (38-40) or even a set of spots deep inside scattering media, is\npossible by use of adaptive wavefront correction (41). These means are, nevertheless,\nboth slow and sensitive, as a different correction has to be applied at any given spatial\n\n11\n\n\fposition within the sample, and little data has been reported on their efficacy in correcting\nthe propagation of extended shaped patterns (42).\nFrom the above considerations, we find that the use of DH or GPC with TF in\ncombination with amplified ultrafast laser pulses of at least a few microjoules (available\nfrom either continuously pumped amplifiers or cavity dumped oscillators) is probably the\nmethod of choice for extending 2P optogenetics to in vivo applications.\nMethods\nNumerical simulations\nFor the numerical simulation of the evolution of temporally focused beams inside turbid\ntissue we used 100 fs pulses centered at either 800 nm or 950 nm. As a scattering sample\nwe considered a homogeneous medium in which 2 \u03bcm dielectric spheres, having a\nrefractive index higher by 0.1 than the surrounding medium and an average concentration\nof 1 scatterer per 1000 \u03bcm3, are randomly distributed. The simulations are performed\niteratively, whereby in each simulation step the beam is propagated via the angular\nspectrum of plane waves approach and then a spatial phase is imprinted on it according to\nthe distribution of scattering spheres. This approach, where backscattering is neglected, is\na legitimate approximation within, for example, brain slices, where the index contrast\nwithin the sample is typically very small.\nOptical setup for beam propagation characterization\nThe light source used for the experiments was a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai,\nSpectra-Physics; \u0394t=100 fs, \u0394\u03bb=10 nm, repetition rate 82 MHz), whose output beam\npower was controlled by an achromatic half-wave (\u03bb/2) plate combined with a Glan-laser\ncalcite polarizer cube.\nThe characterization of the beam propagation through the different types of brain\nslices was done in a microscope configuration with two opposite placed objectives\n(\"double microscope\") (Fig. 2a), described in previous works (20, 23). 2P fluorescence\nwas excited through a 60x microscope objective (Olympus, LUMPLFL60xW/IR2, NA\n0.90) on a ~1 \u03bcm-thick fluorescent layer of rhodamine-6G in PMMA, spin-coated on a\nglass coverslip, through different thicknesses of fixed or acute brain slices. The emitted\n12\n\n\ffluorescence was collected by a second objective (Olympus, UPLSAPO60xW, NA 1.20)\nplaced opposite to the excitation one, disposing a correction collar for the coverslip\nthickness. The use of two independent objectives allowed straightforward imaging of outof-focus planes of the excitation volume, in order to precisely derive the axial\npropagation of the excitation beam around the objective's focal plane. The imaging\nobjective was fixed and focused on the thin fluorescent layer, while the upper one was\nmoved along the axial direction (\u00b140 \u03bcm around its focal plane, in steps of 0.5 \u03bcm) with\na piezo-scanning stage working in closed-loop (MIPOS100SG, Piezosystem Jena). The\nfluorescence was imaged by a collection tube lens (f=150 mm) to a CCD camera\n(CoolSNAP HQ2, Roper Scientific). To reject the excitation light, an emission filter\n(Chroma Technology HQ 535/50M) and a dichroic filter (Chroma Technology\n640DCSPXR) were placed in front of the CCD camera.\nTo deduce the axial resolution, we scanned the excitation objective through the\nfluorescent layer and measured the excited fluorescence intensity at each plane. The axial\nresolution was considered as the FWHM value of the plot of the normalized 2P\nfluorescence intensity for the different axial planes.\nTemporal focusing setup\nThe accordingly modulated laser beam for the generation each time of the Gaussian,\nholographic or GPC patterns was sent to a reflectance diffraction grating (830 lines/mm)\naligned perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope. The illumination angle of the\ngrating was ~42o at 800 nm, or 52\u00b0 at 950 nm, such as the +1 order diffracted beam at the\ncenter frequency of the excitation pulse was directed along the optical axis of the\nmicroscope. The grating dispersed the various frequency components of the beam, which\nwere imaged onto the sample via a telescope comprised of an achromatic lens (f=500mm)\nand the excitation objective. Whenever experiments without temporal focusing were\nperformed, the diffraction grating of the optical setup was replaced with a plane metallic\nmirror.\nGaussian beam illumination\nThe laser beam was spatially expanded with a variable beam expander (2x-5x) and\nsent to the diffraction grating for temporal focusing. The expansion of the laser beam\n\n13\n\n\fbefore the grating was such as the lateral size of the Gaussian beam at the sample plane\nwas 11 \u03bcm at FWHM.\nDigital Holography-generated beam illumination\nThe principle of DH consists in calculating with an iterative Fourier transform\nalgorithm (43 , 44), given a target intensity at the objective's focal plane, the phase\npattern at the rear aperture of the objective that permits one to reproduce the target. The\ncalculated phase-hologram is addressed to a spatial light modulator (SLM) that imposes\nthe phase modulation onto the input beam's wavefront. After propagation through the\nobjective, the beam is focused onto a spot, reproducing straight away the desired\ntemplate.\nIn the experimental setup the laser beam was expanded (10x) in order to match the\ninput window of a Liquid Crystal on Silicon Spatial Light Modulator (LCOS-SLM)\n(Hamamatsu Photonics X10468-02), illuminated at oblique incidence, as in previous\nworks (23, 24). As described there, the beam's wavefront at the SLM plane was modified\nby using a custom-designed software (20) that, given a target intensity distribution at the\nfocal plane of the microscope objective, calculates the corresponding phase-hologram by\nusing the iterative algorithm. The beam reflected from the LCOS-SLM was Fourier\ntransformed by a 1000 mm focal length achromatic lens and formed a first image of the\ntarget intensity onto the grating for TF. In this way a depth-resolved temporally focused\nexcitation pattern was generated at the focal plane of the objective, whose lateral spatial\ndistribution was a reduced (~1/170) replica of the pattern generated on the grating.\nGeneralized Phase Contrast-generated beam illumination\nIn GPC the output light distribution is obtained by the interference between a signal\nand an unscattered light component (zero order), which travel along the same optical\naxis. The desired target intensity map is converted into a spatially similar phase map that\nis addressed on the SLM. A phase contrast filter (PCF) placed at the Fourier plane of the\nSLM imposes a half-wave (\u03bb/2) phase retardation between the on-axis focused\ncomponent and the higher-order diffracted Fourier components. The interference between\nthe phase-shifted focused and the scattered light, allows generating a pure phase-tointensity conversion at the output plane.\n\n14\n\n\fHere, the LCOS-SLM was controlled by another option of the custom-designed\nsoftware that, given a target intensity distribution at the focal plane of the microscope\nobjective converts the intensity map into a binary phase map and addresses the output\nprofile to the SLM. The beam reflected from the SLM was separated in its Fourier\ncomponents by a 400 mm focal length achromatic lens and focused on the PCF,\npositioned at the Fourier plane of this lens. The on-axis, low spatial frequency\ncomponents were shifted in phase by \u03bb/2, by the PCF and then, the second 300 mm\nachromatic lens recombined the high (signal wave) and low (synthetic reference wave)\nspatial frequency components. The introduced phase shift caused these components to\ninterfere and produced an intensity distribution according to the spatial phase information\ncarried by the higher spatial frequencies. Then the beam was sent to the diffraction\ngrating and the setup for temporal focusing was following. The 500 mm lens and the\nmicroscope objective formed the second 4-f lens system that scaled the intensity\ndistribution (~ 1/110) on the sample plane.\nFor further details on how to get optimal contrast conditions at the output plane of the\nsystem (focal plane of the 300 mm lens, which coincides with the grating plane) and how\nto choose the size of the PCF, the reader can refer to our previous work (28).\nBrain slices preparation\nAll experiments followed European Union and institutional guidelines for the care and\nuse of laboratory animals (council directive 86/609EEC).
