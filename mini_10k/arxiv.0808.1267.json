In order to\nachieve this, the authors address the important topic of the most general form of the renormalised stress-energy\ntensor associated to meaningful semiclassical solutions of the Einstein's equations.\nIn this paper we look at the problem from the point of view of the local quantum field theory (lqft) of the\nCasimir effect introduced in [3] and developped in [4] and [5]. As proposed in [3], measuring the (renormalised)\nHamiltonian density H(x) (see eq. (7) below) is a local operation: in order to measure H(x), our measuring\napparatus needs only examine a small neighborhood ,say N , of x, whose observable algebra has precisely the\nsame structure as if it were embedded in globally flat space-time, and thus needs no information from global\ntopology. What does depend on the global structure is the state of the system. There exists, however, a proviso:\nhow small may N be? It cannot be reduced to the point x, because of the local structure of quantum fields,\nbut may, in priciple, be arbitrarily small: on the other hand, the energy density is not bounded below (as an\noperator valued distribution) as N contracts to a point [6]. This large indeterminacy, further discussed below, is\nthe main subject of our paper. We work at fixed time (which may be thought as the cosmic time in applications\nto general relativity) and absorb the indeterminacy involved in the choice of N in the dimension of a \"small\"\nregion of fixed shape - we take it for simplicity to be a cube of side L- to which we \"restrict\" a free scalar\nquantum field by imposing some boundary condition (b.c.). One might expect that the state of the system\nbe independent of this \"local\" b.c., but that is not the case. Indeed, as proved in [5], only periodic b.c. are\ncompatible with lqft for a scalar quantum field and, clearly, there is a global change of spatial topology in\npassing to periodic b.c.. The word \"local\" means, in this special context, that\nL \u226a Lc\n\n(1a)\n\nwhere Lc denotes a characteristic length of the system. In Cosmology, Lc = LH , where LH is the Hubble\nlength (see, e.g., [13]). we shall come back to (1a) in section IV.\nA special issue has acquired special interest in present-day Cosmology: are there low-energy states of a scalar\nquantum field with the properties: a.) negative pressure; b.) the cosmological constant condition\np = \u2212\u03c1\n\n(1b)\n\nwhere p is the pressure and \u03c1 the energy density corresponding to the given state. From a.) and b.) there\nresults c.)\n\u03c1\u22650\n\n(1c)\n\nThe precise significance of (1a)-(1c) and the relation to the cosmological constant is discussed in section IV.\nWe point out, however, that condition a.) is independent of the cosmological constant relation b.) and is a\nwell-known property of dark energy, a model of which is considered as an application of the results of section\nIII and part of section IV at the end of the latter section (after (36a)). However, a.) is included because it is\nuniversally true as a well-known intrinsic property of the vacuum state ([9],[10]) and we wish to preserve it for\nour class of states.\nIn the models treated so far, such as the free electromagnetic field and the conformally invariant scalar field\n[7] enclosed by parallel plates, the energy-momentum tensor was traceless and, due to this condition, Dirichlet\nand Neumann b.c. were bona fide b.c. (see, also, ref. [5]). In this typical situation, a.) was true but not c.) the energy density was also negative - so that b.) was not realized. In both cases the associated quantum field\nwas massless, and the same happens for a massless scalar quantum field. We were thus led to study the case of\na massive quantum scalar field, i.e., of mass \u03bc 6= 0, about which only incomplete results (with periodic b.c.)\nexist [8]. This is also the case for which a cosmological constant emerges in the analysis of [1].\nOur result is that a. and b.) (and consequently c.)) are true for a state consisting of the vacuum and some\nzero momentum excitations, if the size L of the cube is of the order of the Compton wave-length of the particle\n\n\f3\n1/\u03bc. This is reasonable because the vacuum and the particles of zero momentum correspond to lowest energy\nand p \u2264 0. On the other hand a.) and b.) represent very strong constraints: they prevent, in particular, that\nL \u2192 0, i.e., that the neighborhood N above shrinks to a point.\nIn the next section II we review our definition of the correct energy density operator, which is the basis of all\nour results.\nIn section III we derive the energy density and pressure in closed form for the vacuum state. The result for\nthe pressure involves some remarkable cancellations and is new. It implies property a.).\nIn section IV we prove properties b.) and c.) for a special state consisting of the vacuum and some excitations\n(particles) of zero momentum.\nSection V is reserved to the conclusion.\nIt should be stressed that there exists an immense literature on the Casimir effect. In particular, zeta function\nmethods have been studied during several decades and are also, in principle, applicable to the problem treated\nin section III, see [9], [10] and references given there, in particular, reference [10] for rigorous results.\nApplications of the Casimir effect to Cosmology from a different point of view were made in references [19],\n[20], [21] and [22]. We refer, in particular, to the very nice review of Elizalde [20] and references given there on\nthe dynamical Casimir effect. See also refs. [23] and [24].\n\nII.\n\nTHE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\n\nWe review in this section the conceptual framework , following [5], for a rigorous, regularization- independent\nlocal quantum field theoretic (lqft) treatment of the internal Casimir energy and pressure of a cube for a quantum\nscalar field of mass \u03bc 6= 0.\nWe shall define a state of the field, as is common in lqft [11], as a positive normalized linear functional \u03c9(* * * )\nsuch that \u03c9(identity) = 1, \u03c9(A\u2020 A) \u2265 0, where A a bounded observable, and A\u2020 its adjoint. Occasionally, A\nwill be taken as an unbounded operator, assuming that \u03c9(A) is well defined, which will be shown to be the case\nwhen A is the (renormalized) Hamiltonian density and \u03c9 a special state. Examples of states are vacuum states\nand temperature states [9], or\n\u03c9F (A) = (\u03a9F , A\u03a9F )\n\n(2)\n\nthe Fock vacuum state, where \u03a9F is the Fock vacuum. Let \u03a6(x) denote a scalar quantum field of mass \u03bc 6= 0\n(~ = c = 1) on symmetric Fock space F :\nZ\n1\n1\n[a~ e\u2212ik.x + a~\u2020 eik.x ]\nd3 k \u221a\n\u03a6(x) =\n3/2\nk\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c9k k\n(3)\nwhere x = (x0 , ~x), k = (k0 , ~k), k.x = k0 x0 \u2212 ~k * ~x, a, a\u2020 are the usual annihilation and creation operators and\np\nk0 = \u03c9k = k 2 + \u03bc2\n(4)\nwith k = |~k|. Occasionally, we shall use a cutoff version of (1),\nZ\n1\n1\n[a~ e\u2212ik.x + a~k eik.x ]C\u039b (k)\nd3 k\n\u03a6\u039b (x) =\n3/2\n2\u03c9k k\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u039b\u22121 \u2265 0 is a cutoff with dimension of length, and C\u039b is a smooth function whose properties will be\nspecified later. The associated formal Hamiltonian density is\nT00 (x) =\n\n1\n[(\u2202\u03c6(x)\u2202x0 )2 + (\u2207\u03c6(x))2 + \u03bc2 (\u03c6(x))2 ]\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\nWe shall be interested in the expectation value of T00 (x) in certain states. Taking as a state the Fock vacuum\nstate (1), we find for the expectation value of the formal Hamiltonian density\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03c9F,00 (f ) =\nd~x\u03c9F (T00 (x0 , ~x)f (~x) = =\nd3 k f \u0303(~k)\u03c9k\n(7)\n2\nwhere \u03c9k is given by (3) and f \u0303 denotes the Fourier transform of f . The necessity of using a test function f - as\nusual in lqft, f \u2208 S, where S is the Schwartz space of infinitely differentiable functions of fast decrease [11]- is\ndue to the fact that \u03c9F,00 is, for fixed time x0 , a distribution, an essential feature of lqft, and the limit f \u2192 \u03b4, \u03b4\nbeing the delta function, is ill-defined: there is a well-known reason for that, both mathematical and physical,\nsee ([12], p.35) for a nice elementary physical discussion. Unfortunately, there is a too large indeterminacy\nassociated to the test function f in (7). This is one of the basic problems in applications to Cosmology, where\nwe wish to compute a \"local\" value of the energy density, at least closest possible to the approximation of\nperfect homogeneity, which is surprisingly successful [13].\nIn order to attack the above problem, we attempt to \"restrict\" the quantum field to certain simple compact\nregions, characterized by some fixed number with the dimensions of length, which we denote by L. The simplest\nchoice is a cube of side L,with a collection of such cubes providing a cover of Euclidean space. With such a\nchoice, L still remains as a free parameter, but the indeterminacy is widely reduced. What is, however, the\ncorrect formula for the Hamiltonian density in this case? On Fock space F , the quantity T00 (x), formally defined\nby the r.h.s. of (6), is not a well-defined operator-valued distribution: only the Wick-ordered density\nH(x) =: T00 (x) := T00 (x) \u2212 \u03c9F (T00 (x))\n\n(8)\n\nis one. In going over from (8) to a compact region K with boundary \u2202K, it is convenient to rewrite the Wick\nproduct in (8) using the point-splitting technique ([4],p.316;[6], appendix) and reexpressing the field in terms of\ndifferent creation and annihilation operators \u00e3~k associated to the eigenfunctions given below in (11d),(11e)(see\n(10) of [4] for details). These fields, denoted by \u03c6\u0303, define a new representation, corresponding to a different\nobservable algebra ( the Hilbert space of test functions is no longer L2 ((R)3 ), see ([5], (2.13) et ff), a new density\nT^\n00 (x), which results from writing (6) in the new representation, and a new vacuum \u03a9, annihilated by the new\nabsorption operators associated to the eigenfunctions.

It is the only possible universal normalization condition, because only the\nfield \u03c6 in infinite (Minkowski) space-time is a standard (universal) object. This is the justification of (10), (11a),\non which all our results are based.\nFor a conformally invariant scalar quantum field, which is traceless, i.e.\ng \u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(12a)\n\nthe r.h.s. of (11a) is finite and homogeneous for Dirichlet (and Neumann) b.c. [8]. This is due to a remarkable\ncancellation brought about by (12a)[8]. In applications to Cosmology,\n\nhT\u03bc\u03bd ivac = g\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1vac = diag (\u03c1vac , pvac , pvac , pvac )\n\n(12b)\n\nwith g\u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121), and thus (12a) is not valid: see section IV. For this reason we are led to study\nan (ordinary) quantum scalar field, for which Dirichlet and Neumann b.c. are incompatible with the general\nprinciples of lqft [5]. This fact, not generally appreciated, was also emphasized by Hagen [14] with a different\nwording, i.e., that there is no justification to eliminate the ensuing divergent surface terms. These result from\nthe wild fluctuations of quantum fields over sharp surfaces [15].\nThere remains the choice of periodic b.c. as the only sufficiently \"soft\" b.c., which we adopt as in [5]. This\nchoice is technical, but has a nice property in the applications to Cosmology: the ensuing energy density may\nbe shown to be uniform i.e, independent of x, and equals the average value of the energy in a cube of side L\ncontaining the point, with periodic b.c.. The parameter L plays the role of the test function in (7) and is to be\nchosen as small as the local structure of quantum fields permits, approaching as closely as possible the idealized\ncondition of perfect homogeneity of classical Cosmology.\nIn order to find upper and lower bounds on L we need, however, to compute the r.h.s. of (11a). For that\npurpose we introduce the cutoff field (5) and prove in the forthcoming section III that, for a large class of cutoff\nfunctions C\u039b , we obtain a uniform energy density (25) and the thermodynamic pressure (27) in closed form.\nIII.\n\nTHE INTERNAL CASIMIR EFFECT FOR THE MASSIVE SCALAR FIELD IN A CUBE\n\nWe consider a cube of side L adopting periodic b.c., so that the set A in (11c) is A =\neigenfunctions in (11d), given by\nu~n (~x) = L\u22123/2 e(2i\n\nn2 \u03c0\nn3 \u03c0\nin1 \u03c0\nL x+2i L y+2i L z\n\n)\n\n\b 2\u03c0\nL\n\n~n, ~n \u2208 Z3 , with\n(13a)\n\nand \u03c9kn in (11e) of the form\n\u03c9~n =\n\n\"\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nL\n\n\u00132\n\n2\n\n~n + \u03bc\n\n2\n\n#1/2\n\n(13b)\n\nIn order to evaluate the r.h.s. of (10) and (11a), we use regularized fields (5) as well as regularized fields \u03c6 \u0303\u039b\ncorresponding to the fields \u03c6\u0303 in the new representation. Let < T00 (x) >vac,L,\u039b denote the r.h.s. of (11a) but\nwith D0+ (resp.

Indeed, the only possible covariant form for the energy of the quantum\nvacuum is (12b), which is mathematically equivalent to the Cosmological constant \u039b by\n\u039b = 8\u03c0G\u03c1vac\n\n(28)\n\n\f9\n(12b) takes the form of a perfect fluid with energy density \u03c1vac and isotropic pressure pvac = \u2212\u03c1vac which\ncorresponds to (1b) of the introduction. Note that (1a) is universally true as an intrinsic property of the\nquantum vacuum ([9],[10]), which, together with (1b), implies (1c).\nWe now investigate whether (1b) and (1c) hold in the model of section III. The answer is clearly negative:\nSince Ki (x) \u2265 0 for all i and x [17], by (25) and (27) both \u03c1vac,L and pvac,L are negative. Thus (1b) and (1c)\nare violated whatever L.\nIn order to ensure a property corresponding to (1c) (our (1c')), we propose to add some one-particle excitations\nof zero momentum to the vacuum energy: they are the (one-particle) excitations of lowest energy compatible\nwith pressure p \u2264 0. The states of zero momentum are compatible with periodic b.c. and have energy \u03bc; the\ncorresponding total energy EL is\nEL = Evac,L + \u03bc\n\n(29a)\n\n\u03c1\u0303vac = \u03c1\u0303vac,L = L\u22123 EL\n\n(29b)\n\nWe write\n\nThe corresponding state of the quantum field is (where A is any observable):\n\u2032\n\nhAivac,L = ((\u00e3~0 )\u2020 \u03a9, A(\u00e3~0 )\u2020 \u03a9)\n\n(30)\n\nand corresponds to one particle of zero momentum in each cube, and thus to a one particle energy density \u03bcL\u22123 .\nWe now take \u03bc as a fixed given quantity and, assuming (27), inquire into the possible values of L. There are\nthree cases :\na.)r \u226a 1\nIn this case\nL \u226a 1/\u03bc\n\n(31a)\n\nand we may take the zero mass limit in \u03c1vac,L (\u03bc \u2192 0+), obtaining from (24),(25) for Evac,L :\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 \u22122 \u22124\n2L X\u2032\n\u22122 \u22124\nL m + L m\nEvac,L = \u2212\n(2\u03c0)2\n2\n3\nm\u2208Z\n~\n\n4L\u22121 X\u2032 1\n= \u2212\n= \u22120.52L\u22121\n(2\u03c0)2\nm4\n3\nm\u2208Z\n~\n\n(31b)\nAbove, we used (for z \u2192 0+)\nK0 \u223c \u2212 ln z\n\n(31c)\n\nand\nK\u03bd \u223c\n\n1\n\u0393(\u03bd)\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nz\n2\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03bd\n\n(31d)\n\nThe condition\n\u03c1\u0303vac > 0\n\n(1c\u2032 )\n\n\u03bc \u2265 0.52L\u22121\n\n(31e)\n\nin (27) (corresponding to (1c)) yields, by (31b),\n\n\f10\nin contradiction with (31a). Note that no principle of lqft sets a lower limit to the localization region, except\nthe limit L \u2192 0, corresponding to point-like fields: in this case, \u03c1vac,L \u2192 \u2212\u221e, by (25), which agrees with a\ntheorem of Epstein, Glaser and A. Jaffe [6];\nb.)r \u226b 1\nIn this case exponential decay of the Ki (x) [17] yields zero energy density and pressure. This agrees with\nwhat is expected from Newton-Wigner localization of quantum fields [18];\nc.)r \u2248 1\nThe adequacy of this case could be checked by comparing the results with (1c') and (1b). From (24), (29)\none concludes that\n\n\u03c1\u0303vac,L\n\n1\n=\u2212 4\nL\n\n1 X\u2032 \b\n2rm\u22123 K1 (rm) + r2 m\u22122 [K0 (rm) + K2 (rm)] \u2212 r\n(2\u03c0)2\n3\nm\u2208Z\n~\n\n!\n\n(32)\n\nFrom Fig.1 below, one can see that (1c') is satisfied in the interval used. Since the case is r \u2248 1, we used the\nrange r = [0.5, 5].\n\nFIG. 1: Dark Energy density multiplied by L4 as function of r = \u03bcL\n\nLet us require that\nw=\u2212\n\npvac\n\u03c1\u0303L\n\n(33)\n\nWe use (32) and (27) to obtain Fig.2. It shows that (33) is also satisfied, with\n\u22121 \u2264 w < \u22121/2\n\n(34)\n\nin a range of r given by r \u2248 [0.592, 0.739], where r \u2248 0.592 results in a flat (Minkowski) Universe (w=-1). The\nrange (34) is of relevance in Cosmology because, under certain assumptions, it is sufficient for the existence of\nan accelerating Universe [29].\nThus, if we assume\n(a.)positivity (1c');\nall values of r > 0.444 are allowed, according to Fig.1. Assuming, however, in addition:\n(b.)the Cosmological constant condition\npvac,L = \u2212\u03c1\u0303vac,L\n\n(35a)\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 2: w as function of r = \u03bcL\n\n(i.e.,(33), for w = 1), we see that there results a definite nonzero value for \u03c1\u0303vac,L given by\nr \u2248 0.592\n\n(35b)\n\nFor very large boxes (L \u226b \u03bc) the trivial solution satisfying both (a.) and (b.), pvac,L = \u03c1\u0303vac,L = 0 is obtained.\nRemark1\nSince the energy density (24) continues to be uniform by any translation (of the origin) or rotation of the\ncoordinate axes,the state obtained from (30) by ergodic means over the parameters of the Euclidean group\n((~a, R)) yields the same Hamiltonian density (24). There exists, therefore, a Euclidean invariant state of the\nquantum field in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor is of the form (12b), with (1c')\nsatisfied.\nWe have therefore shown that the state (30) (or its Euclidean invariant version, see remark) provides a\nconcrete quantum field model of the Cosmological constant ((1b), (28)) with, in addition, the property (1c').\nWe now come back to the introduction and discuss the possible significance of our results in the application\nof the dark energy problem in Cosmology.\nDark energy X is the biggest challenge for the New Cosmology (see [27] for a readable review). Together with\nthe distinguishing feature of emitting no light, it has large negative pressure pX .

When considering the coupling to gravity, the\nvacuum energy density \u03c1vac acts, as we have seen, like a Cosmological constant \u039b equal to (28), and we have\npresently constructed a state of the quantum field with this property. How does it fit in the general cosmological\n\n\f12\ntheory of dark energy [27], and is it, at least roughly, consistent with the data coming from the analysis of distant\ntype Ia supernovae [31] and e.g. balloon measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\n[32]?\nUnder certain conditions [26], the back-reaction of the quantum field on the space-time geometry is described\nby the \"semiclassical Einstein equation\" [26], which yields for the time-dependent scale factor (see, e.g., [33]):\n\nR\u0308(t) = \u2212\n\n\u039b\n4\u03c0G\n(\u03c1 + 3p)R(t) + R(t)\n3\n3\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u039b is given by (28), and p is the pressure of all forms of matter. Instead of (28), we replace \u039b in (38) by\n\u039b = 8\u03c0G\u03c1\u0303vac,L\n\n(28\u2032 )\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0303vac,L is given by (29b), and may be written, by (30),\n]\n\u03c1\u0303vac,L = hH(x)i\nvac,L\n\n(39)\n\nX\n\n(40)\n\n\u2032\n\n(10), (11e) and the formal expression\n; T00 \u0303(x); =\n\n\u03c9kn a\u2020kn akn\n\nn\n\nyield, together, (29a).\nLet us assume that a sea of slowly moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments - the\nhypothetical axions ([28], [29]) of mass [28]\n\u03bca \u2248 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 eV = 10\u221213 \u2212 10\u221214 GeV\n\n(41)\n\nare described by a scalar quantum field, corresponding to an initial state (30), with L given by (26) and (35b),\nwhich, by (41), yields the value\nL \u2248 5.92 \u00d7 1012 \u2212 1013 GeV \u22121\n\n(42)\n\nwith the estimate for \u03c1X = \u03c1\u039b , here identified with \u03c1\u0303vac,L :\n\u03c1X = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u221256 \u2212 10\u221252 GeV 4\n\n(43)\n\nL \u226a LH \u2248 1042 GeV \u22121\n\n(44)\n\nBy (42),\n\nwith LH denoting the Hubble length [13], proving (1a) of the introduction.\nIs the Cosmological constant, defined by the r.h.s. of (28'), really a constant, i.e., invariant under time\nevolution? Assuming that the energy equation which follows from Friedmann's equation ([13], [33])\ndu\n= \u22123pR2\ndR\n\n(45)\n\nwhere u = \u03c1R3 is the total mass, is also valid for the individual cosmic components X, we obtain from (36a),\n(45):\n\u03c1X R3(1+wX ) = c\n\n(46)\n\n\f13\nwhere c denotes a constant, from which follow that, if w\u039b = \u22121,\n\u03c1\u039b = c\n\n(47)\n\nwhere c again denotes a constant. It follows that if we choose L as above for the initial state of the quantum\nfield (30), (35a) and \u03c1\u0303vac,L , given by (32), are constant throughout evolution, and therefore do define a constant\n\u039b on the r.h.s. of (38), by (32) and (28'). The global topology of the Universe is, of course, determined by\n(38), and has nothing to do with the periodic b.c. on the state, which, in the present model, does not change\nwith (cosmic) time and was just used to determine \u039b. This is consistent with the fact that L only depends\non the mass of the particle and, by (42), lies in the submillimeter range: it is the smallest possible dimension\ncompatible with both the local structure of the underlying quantum field and conditions (1a)-(1c). It is entirely\nnegligible in comparison with the Hubble length, and therefore the assumption of infinite periodicity is harmless.\nWe close this section with some remarks establishing a link to the introduction: the density computed on\nthe state (30) given by (39) corresponding to any point x is the energy density of any cube containing the\npoint x with periodic b.c.. The pressure is the thermodynamic pressure corresponding to this energy, defined\nin (26), corresponding to what an observer at x would measure in a Gedankenexperiment. From this point of\nview, the partition into cubes may be dispensed with: it served as intermediary step to construct a state of the\nquantum field depending on a parameter L with the stated properties. In particular, the energy density and the\npressure do not depend either on the time or on the space variable, only on L, and therefore are homogeneous,\nas expected for a theory of dark energy in the approximation of perfect homogeneity (see, e.g., [13]), which has,\nof course, nothing to do with the real physical cosmological homogeneity, whose scale is of order 70 \u2212 100H 1\n[30], and is traditionally accounted for theoretically by cosmological perturbation theory (see, e.g., [33]).\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we used the conceptual framework introduced in [5] to obtain closed form expressions for the\nenergy density and the pressure of a massive quantum scalar field with periodic b.c. on a cube, which completes\nthe analysis of [8]. As an application, we showed that positivity (1c') and the cosmological constant property\n(1b) hold true for a special state of the quantum field consisting of the vacuum and (a certain density of) oneparticle excitations of zero momentum, if the length of the cube is a fixed number of the order of the Compton\nwavelength of the particle.\nWe consider two points of special relevance in our work. The first one was to point out how strong the\nconstraints of negative pressure and the cosmological constant condition are: they are, in particular, inconsistent\nwith the catastrophic limit L \u2192 0, because they require positivity of the energy density (1c). The second basic\npoint is the crucial role played by the condition of nonzero mass \u03bc 6= 0: for zero mass, if one attempts to make\n\u03c1\u0303 positive by adjoining low energy one-particle excitations, the resulting pressure will be positive and (1c') can\nnever be realized. In this connection, it is of interest to remark that the emergence of an effective cosmological\nconstant in [1] seems to require positive mass.\nOur tentative approach to dark energy hinges on the existence of a hypothetical scalar particle. Even in\nthe hypothesis of detection of the axion (discussed in detail in ([29], section 10.5.1), several difficult problems\nwould remain open, in particular, what would be the reason for the extraordinary stability of the hypothetical\ninitial state (30)? In this respect, the analysis of [1], based on Hadamard states, goes much deeper: it is also to\nbe stressed that we assumed the existence of a cosmological constant, and looked at the compatibility of this\nassumption with a state of the massive quantum scalar field (see also [23],[24]), while the authors of [1] obtained\nit from first principles. On the other hand, the analysis of [1] seems to contain several a priori undetermined\nconstants, while ours is able to make a definite prediction on the range of the particle masses as to yield a good\ncomparison with experimental data. In fact, the numbers of [28] yield a good comparison with the latter if the\nstate (30) is assumed, as shown at the end of section IV.\nAs a technical open problem, we observe that Theorem 1 does not prove that the distribution at the r.h.s. of\n(11a) is the function (14e), although this is to be expected.\n\n\f14\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe are grateful to the referee for remarks which led to an important conceptual reformulation of a previous\nversion of the paper.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n\nC.
