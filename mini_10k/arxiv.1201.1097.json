In particular, the\nneutron-rich nuclei 12 Be8 , 32 Mg20 , and 42 Si28 were found\nto exhibit large collectivity in spite of their \"magic\" neutron numbers N=8, 20, and 28 (see for instance [1\u20133]).\nThis disappearance of traditional magic numbers was ascribed to so far unexplored nuclear forces which act to\nreduce the size of the spherical shell gaps [4]. Consequently nucleon excitations across these reduced gaps\nbecome easier, increasing the amount of multi-particle\nmulti-hole configurations. Nuclei exhibiting these large\ncorrelations are usually deformed.\nWe have recently reviewed the major structural features along the isotonic and isotopic chains around the\nspherical magic numbers [5]. By the way we have pointed\nout the role of spin-flip interactions between protons and\nneutrons to modify the harmonic oscillator or spin-orbit\nmagic shells in a consistent manner (see the various examples displayed in Figs. 45 and 46 of Ref. [5]). We surmised in particular that nuclear forces were acting to reduce the N = 50 gap when Z decreases towards Z = 28.\nIf true this would jeopardize the magicity of 78\n28 Ni50 . On\nthe other hand, recent values of atomic masses measured\nwith high precision using Penning trap mass spectrometers [6, 7] were interpreted in favor of a reinforced rigidity\nof the N = 50 gap towards 78 Ni.\nThe aim of the present work is to present a detailed\ndiscussion on the evolution of the N = 50 gap from Z =\n28 to Z = 38, which includes the new high-precision mass\nmeasurements. We show in particular the sensitivity of\nthe obtained conclusions with the methods used to derive\nthe shell gap, taking the one or two neutron separation\nenergies from ground or isomeric states. We propose an\ninterpretation of these discrepancies, and extrapolate the\nsize of the N = 50 gap to 78 Ni using what we consider to\nbe the least biased method.\n\nII. THE N = 50 GAP EXTRACTED FROM THE\nPROPERTIES OF THE N = 51 \u2212 50 \u2212 49 ISOTONES\n\nFollowing Ref. [5], we use the binding energy of the last\nnucleon as a single-particle energy1 to study the evolution of the two orbits g9/2 and d5/2 between which the\nN = 50 spherical gap is formed. The Appendix of Ref. [5]\nhas warned the reader about the limitations of such a\nmethod, as for isotopes and isotones having a doublymagic N = Z core or for non-rigid nuclei. In the latter\ncase, the total binding energies of the ground states do\ncontain some correlation energies (from vibrational motion, for instance) which shift the value of the binding\nenergy of the last nucleon.\nBetween Z = 28 and Z = 38, protons occupy the \u03c0f5/2\nand \u03c0p3/2 orbits. Therefore the evolution of the size of\nthe N = 50 shell gap depends on proton-neutron interactions between the protons in the \u03c0f5/2 and \u03c0p3/2 orbits\nand the neutrons in the \u03bdg9/2 and \u03bdd5/2 orbits. The\nlow-energy structure of the N = 50 isotones having oddZ values indicates that the \u03c0f5/2 and \u03c0p3/2 orbits are\n\u2212\nvery close to each others as the 3/2\u2212\n1 and 5/21 states lie\nclose in energy (see Fig. 1). Therefore it is reasonable\nto assume that the two proton orbits are filled simultaneously within the Z = 28 \u2212 38 range and that the\nproton-neutron monopole interactions at work are averpn\naged values between Vfpn\n5\u2212g9 and Vp3\u2212g9 below N = 50\npn\npn\n(denoted as V\u0304fpn\n5/p3\u2212g9 ), and between Vf 5\u2212d5 and Vp3\u2212d5\npn\nabove N = 50 (V\u0304f 5/p3\u2212d5 ).\nThe new high-precision atomic masses of 83,82,81\n32 Ge [6]\nand 81,80,79\nZn\n[7]\nallow\nto\ndisplay\nthe\nbinding\nenergies\n30\nof the last neutron in the N = 51 and 50 isotones in\nFig. 2(a). This figure improves and enlarges the Fig. 28\nof Ref. [5]. We observe a quasi-linear evolution of the\nBE1n values, with the exception of the BE1n (50) value\n\n1\n\nSuch a relation means that the binding energy of the last nucleon,\nnoted BE1n (N) for the neutron, is a negative quantity, i.e. the\ninverse of the separation energy, noted S1n (N).\n\n\f2\n\nExcitation energy (keV)\n\nN=50 isotones\nCu Ga\n\nAs\n\nBr\n\nRb\n\u2212\n\n5/2\n\n400\n\n200\n\u2212\n\n3/2\n0\n29\n\n31 33 35 37\nProton number\n\n39\n\nFIG. 1.

The uncertainties are smaller than\nthe symbols. (b) Difference in binding energies of these two\nstates surrounding the gap at N = 50. The dashed lines are\nthe linear fits using the data at Z = 30, 34, 36 (see text).\n\nThe binding energy of the last neutron in 82\n32 Ge50 lies\nabout 300 keV above the linear fit [see the red triangles\nand the red dashed line in Fig. 2(a)]. This leads to a singularity at Z = 32 which might be viewed as arising from\nthe presence of a subshell closure. Under this assumption two slopes in the binding energies would be observed,\n\none corresponding to the filling of the \u03c0p3/2 orbit until\nZ = 32 and the other to the filling of the \u03c0f5/2 orbit afterwards. However, both the observed ordering of the two\norbits for Z \u2264 33 and their near degeneracy (see Fig. 1)\nare strong arguments against the presence of such a subshell closure. Therefore it is reasonable to think that\nthis singularity at Z = 32 originates from the presence\nof deformation. The BE1n (50) value for 82 Ge involves\nthe binding energies of the 81,82\n32 Ge49,50 nuclei. In order\nto determine whether BE1n (50) contains some amount\nof correlation energy, the structure of 81\n32 Ge49 has to be\nexamined. The ground states of the N = 49 isotones are\n9/2+, likely originating from a (\u03bdg9/2 )\u22121 spherical configuration. The first excited states of the N = 49 isotones\nwith Z\u2265 34 has I\u03c0 =1/2\u2212, it is likely to be of (\u03bdp1/2 )\u22121\norigin. The excitation energies of the 1/2\u2212 states are\nslightly reduced with decreasing Z, i.e. 389 keV in 87\n38 Sr,\n83\nSe.\nWhen\nextrapo305 keV in 85\nKr\nand\n228\nkeV\nin\n36\n34\n\u2212\nlated to 81\n32 Ge, the excited 1/2 state would be expected\nclose to the 9/2+ ground state. Surprisingly its energy\nis as large as 895 keV [10]. This suggests that the 9/2+\nground state contains some additional correlation energy\nwhich decreases the atomic mass of 81\n32 Ge, shifting in turn\nthe binding energy of the last neutron in 82\n32 Ge. Discoveries of the excited states built on the 'collective' 9/2+\nground state and/or measurements of the E2 transition\nprobabilities would ascertain the shape change of 81\n32 Ge\nas compared to the heavier isotones. Unfortunately no\nexcited state with I\u03c0 > 9/2+ is known at the present\ntime [8].\nTo perform the two linear fits drawn in Fig. 2(a), we\nhave chosen to eliminate the data at Z = 32 and Z = 38\nas well, since 88\n38 Sr has the main properties of a doublymagic nucleus (it is used as an inert core in many shell\nmodel calculations of nuclei with Z, N \u2264 50). Indeed\nwhen a closed shell is reached, a sudden reduction of\ncorrelation energies in principle occurs, leading to a variation of the experimental binding energy of the last neutron as mentioned in the Appendix of Ref. [5]. Thus\ntaking into account the data at Z = 30, 34, and 36,\nlinear fits with slopes of |V\u0304fpn\n5/p3\u2212g9 | = 0.60 MeV and\npn\n|V\u0304f 5/p3\u2212d5 | = 0.48 MeV are obtained for BE1n (50) and\nBE1n (51), respectively.\nThe difference of the two binding energies, BE1n (51)\u2212\nBE1n (50), gives the size of the correlated gap, which is\ndrawn in Fig. 2(b). The linear fit gives an extrapolated\nvalue at Z = 28 of 3.44 MeV. However this extrapolated\nvalue will be enhanced if a reduction of correlation occurs\nat Z = 28 as it does at the Z = 38 shell closure (the\nincrease of the gap is 0.17 MeV here). We shall come\nback to this point in Sect. V. Before this, we compare the\npresent conclusions obtained with one-neutron binding\nenergies to those derived when using two-neutron binding\nenergies, a method which is more extensively used in the\nliterature.\n\n\f3\nIII. EVOLUTION OF THE N = 50 GAP FROM\nTHE PROPERTIES OF THE N = 52 \u2212 50 \u2212 48\nISOTONES\n\nThe behavior of the two-nucleon separation energies\nis a widely used indicator of structural evolution as for\nthe emergence of magic numbers. For instance, the twoneutron separation energies of each isotopic chain display\na sudden drop after the magic number when plotted as\na function of the neutron number, as for instance shown\nin the Fig. 2 of Ref. [6]. Similarly, when plotted as a\nfunction of the proton number, two neutron separation\nenergies corresponding to each isotonic series form almost\nparallel and equidistant sequences, displaying a sudden\ngap at the magic number. Such a plot is drawn in the\nFig. 3 of Ref. [6] where the evolution of the N = 50 shell\ngap energy towards 78 Ni is discussed.\nWe show in Fig. 3(a) the two-neutron binding energies\nusing the same conventions as those of Fig. 2 for the purpose of comparison.

(b) Difference of the two-neutron\nbinding energies between the N = 52 and N = 50 isotones.\n\nshell gaps using two neutron binding energies at N = 50,\nthe masses of three isotopes, N = 48, 50, 52, are involved. Assuming that there is no re-arrangement or collective excitation when adding or removing two neutrons\nfrom the semi-magic (N = 50) cores, i.e. the N = 52\n\nand N = 48 isotones are rigid spherical2 , the BE2n (52)\nand BE2n (50) values are directly related to the binding energies of the \u03bdd5/2 and \u03bdg9/2 orbits, respectively.\nThus their variations are expected to be quasi-linear, the\nslope being obtained from the average monopole protonneutron interaction involved, as discussed in Sect. II.\nMoreover the BE2n values should only depend on the\noccupation rate of the \u03c0f5/2 and \u03c0p3/2 orbits, whatever\nthe parity of Z (even or odd). Figure 3(a) shows that\nthe BE2n (50) trend exhibits a kink at Z=32 and that the\nBE2n (52) values obtained for odd-Z and even-Z nuclei\ndo not belong to the same straight line, meaning that the\ncriterion of rigid spherical shapes is not met. As a result,\nthe gap derived from the difference of two-neutron binding energies, BE2n (52) \u2212 BE2n (50), shown in Fig. 3(b)\ndisplays a complex behavior with (i) a staggering as a\nfunction of the parity of Z and (ii) a change of slope at\nZ = 32. By pursuing BE2n (50) trend from Z = 32 to\nZ = 28 one would find an increase of the N = 50 gap\nwhen reaching 78 Ni [6], contrary to what was derived in\nSect. II.\nWe suspect that extra nuclear correlations, which\nwould be maximized at Z = 32, are responsible for this\napparent change of slope at Z = 32. A good indicator of extra correlations can be revealed by the changes\nin the energy of first quadrupole excitation built on the\nground states. The experimental results measured in the\nfive isotonic chains (N = 48 \u2212 52) are used for that pur+\npose, namely (i) the energies of the 2+\n1 \u2192 0gs transitions of the N = 48, 50, 52 nuclei, (ii) the energies of the\n+\n13/2+\n1 \u2192 9/2gs transitions of the N = 49 isotones, and\n+\n(iii) the energies of the 9/2+\n1 \u2192 5/2gs transitions of the\nN = 51 isotones (see Fig. 4).\nThe 2+\n1 excitation of the semi-magic N = 50 nuclei,\nwhich is due to their proton configuration, lies between\n1.35 MeV and 1.84 MeV [Fig. 4(a)]. The N = 51(49)\nisotones [Fig. 4(b)] display similar values to those of their\nN = 50 cores, that is expected if the neutron particle\n(hole) is weakly coupled to the proton excitation of the\ncore3 .\nOn the other hand, the energies of the N = 52 and\nN = 48 isotones [Fig. 4(a)] are two times smaller than\nthose of their N = 50 cores. Moreover, the quadrupole\nenergy in the N = 48 isotones has a minimum at\nZ = 32 \u2212 34, indicating that the quadrupole deformation is maximum at mid proton shell. This hypothesis\n+\nis corroborated by the fact that the E(4+\n1 )/E(21 ) ratio\nreaches its maximum value there, \u223c 2.7, which is intermediate between vibrator and rotor nuclei [see the inset\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\nThen their spectra would only display the states from the jn\nconfiguration, their spacings in energy being due to the two-body\nresidual interactions.\nWithin the weak-coupling scheme, the odd-N nucleus exhibits a\nmultiplet of states with spin values in the range [|jn \u2212 2|, jn + 2]\nat an energy close to the 2+\n1 excitation of the core: This is well\nestablished in some of the N = 51(49) isotones (see Refs. [13, 14]\nand references therein).\n\n\f4\n2000\n\n(a)\n\nin the determination of shell gaps, we propose to use the\nbinding energy of the 8+ isomer of the N = 48 isotones\ninstead of the one of their ground state.\n\n(b)\n\nFirst quadrupole excitation (keV)\n\nN=49\n1500\n\nN=50\n\nN=51\n\nIV.\n\nN=48\n1000\n\n3\n\nR4/2\n\nN=48\n\nN=52\n2\n\nN=52\n\n500\n\n0\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\nproton number\n\n38\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE N = 50 GAP USING\nTHE 8+ ISOMERIC STATE\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\nproton number\n\nFIG. 4.

The\n+\nE(4+\n1 )/E(21 ) ratios, R4/2 , for the N = 52 and N = 48 isotones are shown in the inset. The experimental information\nis from Refs. [8, 11\u201314]\n\nof Fig. 4(b)]. Thus extra binding energy due to correlations depresses to a larger extent the atomic mass of the\nground state of N = 48 isotones at the mid proton-shell,\ngiving rise to the observed increase of BE2n (50). The\nsame mechanism has been recently discussed for isotopes\nwith N \u223c 90 (see the Section 3 of Ref. [15]).\nAs for the N = 52 isotones, their quadrupole energy\ndecreases slowly [see Fig. 4(a)]. Even though their low\n2+\n1 energies are not far from those of the N = 48 isotones,\ntheir quadrupole collectivity is different as demonstrated\n+\nby the fact that the E(4+\n1 )/E(21 ) ratios remain almost\nconstant and close to 2, that is the vibrational limit.\nSince the collective behavior of the N = 52 isotones does\nnot vary significantly with Z, the extra binding energy\ndepresses equally all the ground state masses, thus explaining why the evolution of BE2n (52) remains quasi\nlinear. One may assume that the extra binding is not\nthe same for the even-Z and odd-Z isotones, leading to\nthe two straight lines observed in Fig. 3.\nIn summary, the quadrupole characters associated to\nthe low-energy states of the N = 48 and N = 52 isotones\nadd correlation energies to the BE2n values, which could\ntherefore not be used to determine the evolution of the\nspherical orbits bounding the N = 50 gap. Such a statement had been already put on a firm theoretical basis in\nseveral regions of the nuclear chart for which static deformation and dynamic fluctuations around the mean-field\nground states have proven to modify the atomic masses\nand apparent shell gaps (see for instance, Ref. [16] and\nreferences therein). To reduce the amount of correlations\n\nIsomeric 8+ states have been found around 3 MeV in all\nthe N = 48 isotones. Their configuration was assigned to\n(\u03bdg9/2 )\u22122 in which the two holes couple to the maximum\nspin value J=8 in a spherical configuration (see Ref. [13]\nand references therein). The isomerism is due to the\n+\nrelatively small energy between the 8+\n1 and 61 states.\n+\nSuch a small energy difference implies that the 8 isomers\ncannot belong to a vibrational/rotational band, and are\nwell separated in energy from any 8+ 'collective' state.\nIt follows that the configuration of these 8+ isomers is\nassumed to be rather pure, contrary to that of the ground\nstate. The binding energy of such a spherical state, being\ndirectly related to the one of the orbit, gives another\nmean to characterize the evolution of the \u03bdg9/2 energy as\na function of the proton number.\nFor this purpose, we define another binding energy of\n\u2217\nthe last two neutrons of the N = 50 isotones, BE2n\n(50),\nusing the total binding energies (BE) of the nuclei of interest and the excitation energy of the 8+ isomeric states:\n\u2217\n(Z, 50) = \u2212[BEgs (Z, 50) \u2212 BE8+ (Z, 48)]\nBE2n\n\u2261 [BEgs (Z, 48) \u2212 Eexc (8+ )] \u2212 BEgs (Z, 50) (1)\n\nThe meaning of the neutron binding energies, BE1n ,\n\u2217\n2BE1n , BE2n et BE2n\n, is given in Fig. 5 for the 82,83,84 Se\nisotopes.\n\u2217\nvalues as a function of Z is\nThe evolution of the BE2n\ndrawn in Fig. 6. Noteworthy is the fact that the change\nof slope in BE2n (50) observed at Z = 32 in Fig. 3 has\n\u2217\ndisappeared. The BE2n\nvalues rather display a straight\nline with a slope of -1.19(2) MeV/Z. This slope matches\nthe one of -1.20(1) MeV/Z obtained using the 2BE1n\nvalues. We therefore deduce that a large part of the\ndeviation of BE2n (50) to a straight line originates from\nthe correlation energy of the ground state of the N = 48\nisotones, labeled as V(0+ ) in Fig. 5. Indeed the relative\n+\ndistance in energy between the 0+\ngs and 81 states for the\nN = 48 isotones is maximum at Z \u2243 32, 34 as shown in\nFig. 7.\n\u2217\nIn summary, the approaches using BE1n and BE2n\ngive similar results with respect to the behavior of the\n\u03bdg9/2 orbit as a function of the occupation of the \u03c0f5/2\nand \u03c0p3/2 orbits. As these two approaches do not strictly\nuse the same experimental data (only the atomic masses\nof the N = 50 cores are in common), we have more confidence in the linear fits proposed in Sect.

In this section, we\ndiscuss the behaviors of the two gaps in order to argue\nabout the doubly-magic nature of 78 Ni.\nIn Sect. II, we gave the extrapolation of the N = 50\ncorrelated gap at Z = 28, 3.44 MeV, and the reduction of\ncorrelation energy due to the Z = 38 shell closure, which\namounts to 0.17 MeV. Nevertheless, a much larger singularity may occur in a nucleon shell gap when the number\nof nucleons of the other species is equal to a magic number, the so-called \"doubly\u2013magic effect\" (DME). Besides\nthe well-known cases dealing with the Wigner term which\ngives an additional binding to nuclei having N = Z, there\nare a few other cases which are shown in several figures\nof Ref. [5]. For instance, the Z = 20 gap is enhanced by\n0.86 MeV at N = 28 (see the Fig. 17 of Ref. [5]) and the\nN = 28 gap is enhanced by 0.71 MeV at Z = 20 (see the\nFig. 20 of Ref. [5]), that gives an averaged DME value\nof 0.78 MeV. If the odd-N nuclei close to 78 Ni50 behaves\nas odd-A nuclei close to 48 Ca, the value of the N = 50\nspherical gap for Z = 28 would be 4.2 MeV, as shown in\nFig. 8.\nThe Z = 28 spherical gap is reduced when going towards N = 50. This has been demonstrated by the\nmonopole migration of the \u03c0f5/2 orbit as the \u03bdg9/2 is\nfilled [17], provoking a inversion between the \u03c0p3/2 and\n\u03c0f5/2 in the 29 Cu chain at A = 75 [18]. More indirectly, the B(E2; 0+ \u2192 2+\n1 ) excitation strengths measured in two neutron-rich 28 Ni isotopes [19, 20] can be\nreproduced only when invoking an increasing amount of\nproton core excitations from the \u03c0f7/2 orbital to the\nother \u03c0f p orbits. In addition, the rapid lowering of\n\n4\n\nQuadrupole correlations across the N = 50 and Z = 28 spherical\ngaps may be strongly favored since the two orbits bounding both\nof them have \u2206l = 2: \u03c0f7/2 and \u03c0p3/2 in the one hand, \u03bdg9/2\nand \u03bdd5/2 in the other hand.\n\n\f6\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\nUnder this latter assumption a shape coexistence could\nbe found for 78 Ni, as it has been recently observed at the\nN = 28 shell for 44\n16 S28 [27].\nDME\n\n1n\u2212gap (MeV)\n\n5.0\n\n28\n\nVI.\n\n30 32 34 36\nProton number\n\n38\n\nFIG. 8.

The solid\nline gives the evolution of the N = 50 gap from Z = 28 to\nZ = 38.\n\nthe first 1/2\u2212 state in 69\u221275 Cu and the enhancement of\n\u2212\nthe B(E2; 1/2\u2212\n1 \u2192 3/21 ) transition rates provide other\nproofs of the major role of the \u03c0f7/2 orbital in the description of the Z \u2265 28 isotopes [21]. Moreover, the SM\ncalculations of Ref. [21] indicate that the Z = 28 shell closure gets reduced by about 0.7 MeV between 68 Ni and\n78\nNi.\nTheoretical models predict 78\n28 Ni50 to be a doubly-magic\nspherical nucleus (see, for instance, Refs. [22, 23]). Using the present empirical findings, one can only argue\non qualitative statements upon its magicity. The two\nmagic numbers, 28 and 50, are created mainly by the\nspin-orbit interaction and 78\n28 Ni50 belongs to the same\nfamily of other doubly spin-orbit nuclei as 206 C14 , 42\n14 Si28 ,\nand 132\nSn\n.\nThe\nlatter\nhas\nthe\nmajor\ncharacteristics\n50\n82\nof a doubly-magic spherical nucleus [25, 26] while the\ntwo others have not [3, 24]. The first excited state of\n42\n14 Si28 measured at very low energy is due to the erosion\nof both the Z = 14 and N = 28 shell closures (caused\nby action of the mutual proton and neutron forces) and\nto the quadrupole correlations between states bounding\nthe two gaps [3]. Such a deformed configuration could be\nfound for the ground state of 78 Ni or a low-lying state.\n\n[1] H. Iwasaki et al., Phys. Lett. B 481, 7 (2000).\n[2] D. Guillemaud-Mueller et al., Nucl. Phys.

[6, 7].\nBy extracting the N = 50 gap from these methods, different degrees of correlations are intrinsically involved.\nThese correlations distort the extracted gap value, which\nis rather then a correlated one. The correlations are the\nstrongest at Z = 32, and weakest at the two proton shell\nclosures Z = 38 and Z = 28. It has been shown that\nthe use of two-neutron separation energies to analyze the\nevolution of the N = 50 gap value is the most subject to\ncorrelations provided in particular by the N = 48 nuclei.\nThis is partly remedied by using atomic masses of the\nleast correlated 8+ isomeric state of the N = 48 nuclei,\nrather than those of the N = 48 ground states. Gathering the results of the three methods, we propose a global\nreduction of the N = 50 gap between Z = 38 and Z = 28\nby about 0.55 MeV, which is to combine to the expected\nreduction of the Z = 28 gap at N = 50. It follows that\nthe structure of the 78 Ni nucleus is probably intermediate between the deformed 42 Si and the spherical 132 Sn.\nWhether 78 Ni would be deformed, spherical or exhibit a\nshape coexistence depends on a delicate balance between\nthe size of the Z = 28 and N = 50 spherical gaps which\npreserve its sphericity, and the amount of correlations\nbrought by promoting nucleons across these gaps leading\nto deformation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank J.-C.
