The instability saturation time\nscales are of the order of one billion years or more. For this reason, the bending instability\ncan play an important role in the secular heating of a stellar disk in the z direction. In\nan extensive series of numerical N -body simulations with a high spatial resolution, we\nwere able to scan in detail the space of key parameters (the initial disk thickness z0 , the\nToomre parameter Q, and the ratio of dark halo mass to disk mass Mh /Md ). We revealed\nthree distinct mechanisms of disk heating in the z direction: bending instability of the\nentire disk, bending instability of the bar, and heating on vertical inhomogeneities in the\ndistribution of stellar matter.\n\nSTELLAR RELAXATION IN THE DISKS OF SPIRAL GALAXIES\nAccording to the theory of stellar evolution, the correlation between the spectral types\nof stars in the solar neighborhood and their kinematic parameters found more than half\na century ago (Parenago 1950) is the reflection of another correlation between the stellar\nage and the random velocity dispersion (for a review of the currently available data, see,\ne.g., Fuchs et al. 2000). The latter correlation has the following pattern: the velocity\ndispersion for old stars is, on average, larger than that for young stars. All stars are\nborn with a small spread in random velocities (about 5\u201310 km s\u22121 . In this case, the\nincrease in the velocity dispersion with time (dynamic heating) is the reflection of a\nrandom scattering of stars (continuous or occasional) by massive objects or large-scale\ndensity inhomogeneities.\nTwo pioneering studies (Spitzer and Schwarzshild 1951, 1953), in which large gaseous\nstructures discovered twenty years later as giant molecular clouds (GMCs) from CO\nobservations were postulated as scattering objects, were based on this idea. Subsequently,\nother relaxation mechanisms, for example, interaction with close satellites, were also\nsuggested. The latter mechanism relies on observational data, according to which the\ndisks of galaxies in interacting systems are a factor of 1.5 or 2 thicker than the disks of\nisolated galaxies (Reshetnikov and Combes 1997). Its efficiency is confirmed by numerical\nsimulations (Walker et al. 1999; Velazquez and White 1999).\n1\n\n\fFor isolated galaxies, apart from scattering by GMCs, the heating on inhomogeneities\nin the distribution of stellar matter that arise during the development of internal instabilities in the disk itself is commonly considered. The heating can be produced by transient\nspiral arms or a growing bar and by bending instability.\nIn suggesting a particular dynamic heating mechanism, the following two wellestablished observational facts should be borne in mind.\n(1) The stellar velocity dispersion depends on time as \u03c3tot \u221d t\u03b1 , where \u03c3tot is the\nthree-dimensional velocity dispersion and \u03b1 \u2248 0.33 \u2212 0.5 (Fuchs et al. 2000; Binney et\nal. 2000).\n(2) The ratio of the vertical and radial stellar velocity dispersions is \u03c3z /\u03c3R < 1.\nThe second fact requires an explanation. It is well known that in an equilibrium\naxisymmetric galaxy in the absence of the third integral of motion, \u03c3z and \u03c3R must be\nequal at a given point of the disk (see, e.g., Saslaw 1989). Observational data indicate\nthat this is not the case. The \u03c3z /\u03c3R ratio for stars in the solar neighborhood does not\ndepend on their spectral type (and, hence, on their age) and is \u03c3z /\u03c3R = 0.53 \u00b1 0.07\n(see, e.g., Dehnen and Binney 1998). Until recently, no similar data have been available\nfor external galaxies. At present, this ratio is known for two more nearby galaxies1 :\n\u03c3z /\u03c3R = 0.70 \u00b1 0.19 for NGC 488 (morphological type Sb) (Gerssen et al. 1997) and\n\u03c3z /\u03c3R = 0.85 \u00b1 0.1 for NGC 2985 (morphological type Sab) (Gerssen et al. 2000); i.e., it\nincreases as one passes to earlier-type galaxies.\nSpitzer and Schwarzshild (1951, 1953) showed that when stars are scattered by GMCs,\nthe stellar velocity dispersion increases as \u03c3tot \u221d t1/3 ; i.e., the exponent corresponds to\nthe lower limit of this quantity, which is still in agreement with observational data. If,\nhowever, we take into account the fact that the GMCs are confined in a thin layer and the\nstars lie outside this layer most of the time, then the efficiency of the relaxation mechanism\nassociated with GMCs becomes even lower: \u03c3tot \u221d t0.25 (Lacey 1984). At the same time,\nGMCs are capable of effectively converting the energy of random motions in the disk\nplane into the energy of random motions in the perpendicular direction. Lacey (1984)\nfound that when stars are scattered by GMCs, a ratio \u03c3z /\u03c3R \u2248 0.8 is rapidly established.\nThis ratio is much larger than the value observed for the solar neighborhood, although\nit is close to that obtained for the galaxy NGC 2985. However, no CO-line emission was\ndetected for this galaxy (see, e.g., Merrifield et al. 2000).\nAs regards the spiral arms, numerical simulations (the first numerical results were\nobtained by Sellwood and Carlberg 1984) and analytical calculations (Binney and Lacey\n1988; Jenkins and Binney 1990; Jenkins 1992) show good agreement between the theoretical and observational age \u2013 velocity dispersion relations. However, the following\nshould be remembered: in the above theoretical studies, the spiral arms were assumed\nto effectively scatter stars only in the disk plane. Additional mechanisms are commonly\ninvoked to convert part of the energy in the disk plane into the energy of vertical motions. The combined effect from spiral arms and GMCs yields a result that is in good\nagreement with observational data (Binney and Lacey 1988), but this does not rule out\n1\n\nIn both cases, we give galaxy-averaged data.\n\n2\n\n\fother vertical disk heating mechanisms. For isolated galaxies, bending instability can\nserve as such a mechanism. In addition, as we show below, spiral arms are capable of\nproducing density inhomogeneities in the z direction. The interaction of stars with these\ndensity enhancements also result in an increase of \u03c3z .\nHere, we study in detail the nonlinear growth stages of bending instability and show\nthat it can be responsible for the secular increase of the stellar velocity dispersion in the\nvertical direction.\nBENDING INSTABILITY AS A MECHANISM OF THE SECULAR\nHEATING OF STELLAR DISKS\nThe Linear Theory\nStellar disks are known to be unstable against the formation of spiral arms and bars.\nIn addition, conditions for the growth of bending instability exist in thin equilibrium\ndisks. This instability arises in systems with highly anisotropic particle motions and is\nsimilar to the fire-hose instability in plasma.\nThe bending instability of an infinitely thin gravitating layer with a nonzero velocity\ndispersion was first investigated by Toomre (1966). Toomre is believed to have been\nsceptical about his results. Therefore, they were published in a barely accessible paper\nand only several years ago did they become widely known after their detailed presentation by Merrit and Sellwood (1994). The bending instability of flat stellar systems has\nbeen rediscovered several times. Kulsrud et al. (1971) independently obtained a result\nsimilar to that of Toomre (1966). As regards equilibrium cold disks (with a zero velocity\ndispersion), Hunter and Toomre (1969) showed that they (in contrast to hot disks) are\nstable against the growth of bending perturbations. This fact had long been misused as\nan argument against any astrophysical applications related to bending instability. Only\nin 1977 did Polyachenko and Shukhman construct an exact linear theory for a homogeneous thin layer with a nonzero stellar velocity dispersion. A more realistic model of\na thin layer with the vertical density profile described by the function sech2 (z/z0 ) was\nanalyzed by Araki (1985)2 .\nToomre (1966) was the first to derive the dispersion relation for long-wavelength\n(\u03bb = 2\u03c0/k >> h, where 2h is the layer thickness) bending perturbations\n\u03c9 2 = 2\u03c0G\u03a3|k| \u2212 \u03c3x2 k 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the surface density of the layer stars and \u03c3x2 is the velocity dispersion along a\nparticular coordinate in the layer plane. It follows from Eq. (1) that perturbations with\nwavelengths \u03bb > \u03bbJ \u2261 \u03c3x2 /G\u03a3 are stable, because \u03c9 2 > 0 in this range.\nShort-wavelength perturbations\n\u03bb < \u03bb2 \u2248 h\n2\n\n\u03c3x\n= h\u03b1 ,\n\u03c3z\n\nThe presentation of the results of this analysis by Sellwood and Merritt (1994) made it accessible\nfor a wide circle of researchers.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere\n\n\u03c3x\n,\n(2)\n\u03c3z\nis the control parameter of the bending instability, must also be stable. In this case, the\ntime of one vertical stellar oscillation, t\u22a5 = h/\u03c3z , is longer than the time it takes for\nthe star to traverse one wavelength, tk = \u03bb/\u03c3x . Therefore, the star traverses a distance\nof several wavelengths in the time t\u22a5 . As a result, a mismatch in the coherent particle\nmotion arises, causing the perturbation to decay. Intermediate-wavelength (\u03bb2 < \u03bb < \u03bbJ )\nperturbations are unstable; the bending only grows.\nWhen \u03bb2 = \u03bbJ , the instability region disappears and the disk becomes stable against\nbending perturbations of any wavelengths. The following analytical estimate is valid\nfor the parameter \u03b1 defined by formula (2) in the linear approximation (Toomre 1966;\nKulsrus et al. 1971; Polyachenko and Shukhman 1977; Araki 1985):\n\u03b1\u2261\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bbJ for \u03b1 = \u03b1cr \u2248 3.0 ,\nor\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3z\n\u03c3x\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2248 0.3 .\n\n(3)\n\ncr\n\nThe instability is completely suppressed for \u03c3z /\u03c3x > 0.3 and grows for \u03c3z /\u03c3x < 0.3.\nStars are born out of a gaseous medium and initially have low random velocities.\nThe increase of the velocity dispersion in the radial and azimuthal directions through\nscattering by spiral density waves can lead to an anisotropy of the particle motions in\nthe plane and in the vertical direction. As a result, bending instability can develop in\nthe disk; this instability causes an increase in \u03c3z to the level corresponding to instability\nsaturation and an increase in the stellardisk thickness. The linear criterion gives a low\ninstability saturation level (3). However, as was mentioned above, \u03c3z /\u03c3R \u2248 0.5 in the\nsolar neighborhood. That is why Toomre was sceptical about his discovery. However,\nthe following two things should be remembered. First, (\u03c3z /\u03c3R )cr \u2248 0.3 was obtained\nfrom a linear analysis. Numerical studies of the nonlinear growth stages of bending\ninstability (Raha et al. 1991; Sellwood and Merritt 1994; Merrit and Sellwood 1994;\nand our numerical results) show that the instability is saturated at much larger \u03c3z /\u03c3R .\nSecond, the growth rate of the instability is very low. The saturation time scales are\nseveral billion years.\nFor these two reasons, bending instability can play an important role in the secular\ndisk heating in the z direction.\nThe Numerical Model\nA high spatial resolution in the z direction is required to properly simulate the growth\nof bending instability in numerical simulations. In the N-body problem, this is possible\nonly for a large number of gravitationally interacting particles. In the first numerical\nmodels, N was taken to be 100 000 (Raha et al. 1991; Sellwood and Merritt 1994;\nMerrit and Sellwood 1994). We used a considerably larger number of particles, N =\n300 000 \u2212 500 000, which made it possible to reach a higher resolution and to trace the\nevolution of the stellar disk on time scales of about 5 Gyr. In addition, our model of\n4\n\n\fa disk galaxy is much more realistic: we considered a rotating disk with an exponential\ndensity profile and assumed the existence of an additional spherical component (a dark\nhalo). Finally, we scanned in detail the space of control parameters (see the next section)\nand found many of the growth features of bending instability that were overlooked both\nin the linear analysis and in the numerical simulations.\nIn our numerical simulations, we simulated the evolution of an isolated disk galaxy\nby using an algorithm that is based on the data structuring in the form of an hierarchical\ntree (Barnes and Hut 1986). Its implementation was taken from the NEMO package\n(http://astro.udm.edu/nemo; Teuben 1995). The package was adapted to personal computers and significantly expanded by including original data analysis and visualization\nprograms.\nIn specifying a galaxy model, we separated two subsystems: the stellar disk and the\nspherically symmetric component (a dark halo). Star formation was disregarded. The\ndisk was represented as a system of gravitating bodies with R and z density profiles,\nwhich corresponds to the observed brightness profiles for spiral galaxies:\n\u03c1d (R, z) =\n\nMd\nz\nR\n2\n*\nsech\n*\nexp\n\u2212\n4\u03c0h2 z0\nh\nz0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere h is the exponential disk scale length, z0 is the typical scale of density variation in\nthe z direction, and Md is the total disk mass.\nThe spherical component was described in terms of the external static potential\n\u03a6h (r) = \u2212\n\n2\nv\u221e\nln(r 2 + a2h ) ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ah is the typical scale and v\u221e is the velocity of a particle on a circular orbit in this\npotential for r \u2192 \u221e ((v\u221e can be expressed in terms of the halo mass within a sphere of\na given radius and the parameter ah ).\nWe specified the initial particle velocities (the rotation velocity and the random component) on the basis of equilibrium Jeans equations using a standard technique with a\nspecified dependence \u03c3R2 \u221d \u03a3(R), where \u03a3(R) is the disk star surface density (see, e.g.,\nHernquist 1993).\nAll of the parameters specified in a numerical simulation can be divided into three\ngroups: input parameters of the algorithm for solving the N-body problem, parameters of\nthe initial model, and control parameters of the problem (the parameters that significantly\naffect the processes under consideration).\n(1) Parameters of the algorithm: \u03b4t = 0.5 \u00d7 106 yr (occasionally, 0.25 \u00d7 106 yr) is\nthe integration step; Tend = 3000 \u2212 5000 Myr is the total integration time, \u03b8 = 0.7 is\nthe parameter responsible for the accuracy of calculating the force (see, e.g., Hernquist\n1987); in addition, in our computations, we took not one but the first two terms in\nthe Laplace expansion of the potential: the monopole and quadrupole terms (Hernquist\n1987); eps = 0.02 kpc is the potential smoothing parameter.\n(2) Parameters of the initial model: h = 3.5 kpc is the exponential disk scale length;\nah = 2 kpc is the dark-halo scale parameter; and Md = (4 \u2212 8) \u00d7 1010M\u2299 is the disk mass.\n5\n\n\fTable 1: Initial parameters of the numerical models\nMhalo (4h)/Mdisk(4h)\n3.0\n1.5\n0.85\n0.6\n\nz0 (kpc)\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.25\n0.1\n0.25\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\nQ\n2.0\n\n1.5\n91\n24\n22\n28\n8, 8 1\n\n12\n27 1\n23\n29, 29 1\n11, 11 1,\n11 2, 11 3\n\n2.2\n33\n31\n20\n\n21\n26, 26 1\n30\n32\n\n(3) Control parameters of the problem. Let us consider them in more detail.\n(A) z0 = 0.1 \u2212 0.5 kpc is the initial disk halfthickness (this quantity can be related to\nthe initial velocity dispersion \u03c3z by assuming that the system is vertically isothermal, \u03c3z2 =\n\u03c0Gz0 \u03a3(R)). Since we are concerned with the increase of the stellar velocity dispersion\nin the z direction, we constructed an initially thin equilibrium galaxy with a small value\nof z0 . This, in turn, implies a small velocity dispersion in the z direction. Next, we\nobserved the development of bending instability, which leads to stellar relaxation. By\nvarying z0 , we were able to determine the instability saturation level independent of the\ninitial conditions.\nThe assumption that the system is isothermal and the dependence \u03c3R2 \u221d \u03a3(R) taken\nfrom empirical considerations yields the relation \u03c3z /\u03c3R = const for the initial time. The\nratio \u03c3z /\u03c3R has always been lower than the value that follows from the linear criterion\nfor bending instability. As a result, we were able to subsequently analyze the instability\nsaturation level for various R.\n(B) Q8.5 = 1.5 \u2212 2.2 is the Toomre parameter (Toomre 1964) at Rref = 8.5 kpc (this\nquantity characterizes the initial radial velocity dispersion at this radius Rref ). It follows\nfrom the dependence \u03c3R2 \u221d \u03a3(R) that\n\u03ba\nQ = \u03c3R /\u03c3Rcr \u221d \u03a31/2 \u221d \u03ba(R) exp(R/2h) ,\n\u03a3\nwhere \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency; i.e., in contrast to \u03c3z /\u03c3R , Q is not constant for the\nentire disk. The function Q(R) for an exponential disk has a broad maximum in the\nrange h < R < 3h (see Fig. 1 in Hernquist 1993). Specifying Rref \u2248 2.5h \u2248 8.5 kpc gives\nthe condition Q(R) \u2265 Q8.5 . This condition, in turn, ensures a level of stability against\nperturbations in the disk plane that is not lower than the level specified at Rref .\nHere, we were concerned with two cases:\n- a large value of Q8.5 (\u2248 2.0) or, in other words, a large initial radial velocity\ndispersion at which the formation of a bar in the disk is suppressed; this allows the\n6\n\n\fdevelopment of bending instability to be traced in pure form (without the influence of a\nbar).\n- a moderate value of Q8.5 (\u2248 1.5); in this case, the disk is unstable against the\ngrowth of a bar mode and we were able to investigate the influence of a bar on the\nrelaxation in the z direction.\n(C) Mh (4h)/Md (4h) = 0.6 \u2212 3.0 is the ratio of dark-halo mass to disk mass within\na sphere of radius 4h. The spherical component is a stabilizing factor during the development of bending instability; we consider its influence on the secular galaxy heating in\nthe section entitled \"Stellar Relaxation in Models...\".\nFor our computations, we used PC-compatible computers of the Astronomical Institute of the St. Petersburg State University. Some of the numerical simulations were\ncarried out in cluster mode. The table gives the numbers of all of the models analyzed\nbelow3 .\nResults of the Numerical Simulations\nWe carried out a large series of stellar-dynamics simulations and studied the growth\nof bending instability in thin stellar disks as a function of the control parameters of the\nproblem. Analysis of the results of our computations revealed three distinct mechanisms\nof stellar relaxation in the vertical direction. The following system of units is used in\nall of the figures that illustrate our conclusions: the unit of time is 1 Myr; the unit of\nvelocity is 978 km s\u22121 ; and the unit of length is 1 kpc.\nLarge-Scale Bending Instability of the Disk. The large-scale bending instability\nof the entire disk is the first galaxy heating mechanism. It is most typical of galaxies\nwith low-mass spherical components that are initially hot in the plane, i.e., of galaxies\nin which the formation of a bar was suppressed (for bar-mode suppression mechanisms,\nsee, e.g., the monograph of Binney and Tremaine 1987).\nBelow, we describe the scenario for the development of bending instability using\nModel 26 1 as an example. All of the key evolutionary features of the stellar disk that\nwere shown by this model were also observed in other hot models.\nIf we decompose z(R) (the mean particle deviation from the z = 0 plane) into Fourier\nharmonics, z\u0304m (R) = Am exp (\u2212im\u03c6), then we can calculate the amplitudes of the first\nthree harmonics (m = 0 is the axisymmetric bending or, alternatively, the bell mode; m =\n1 is the bending mode; and m = 2 is the saddle-type mode). The change of Am with time\ndescribes the various bending formation stages shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (left panels). These\nstages are more clearly distinguished in the color two-dimensional histograms that can\nbe found at http://www.astro.spbu.ru/staff/seger/articles/warps 2002/fig1 web.html. In\nthese histograms, the mean disk particle deviation from the z = 0 plane is represented by\ndifferent colors (the shades of yellow and blue indicate upward and downward deviations,\nrespectively). We see in Figs. 1 and 2 (as in the two-dimensional histograms) that a largescale bending is produced in the galaxy at a time t \u2248 200 Myr. At t \u2248 400 Myr, the\n3\n\nThe models with equal control parameters have di.erent random realizations of the initial conditions - particle positions and random velocities.\n\n7\n\n\fbending amplitude reaches its local maximum. The bending perturbation wavelength (the\nradial extent) is comparable to the disk scale length. The bending is not axisymmetric;\nthe amplitude of the zero mode, i.e., the mode with the azimuthal number m = 0, is\nsmall, at least less than the amplitudes of other harmonics. This relationship between\nthe harmonic amplitudes is preserved until t \u2248 800 Myr.\nNext, a steadily growing axisymmetric bending mode (m = 0) is clearly revealed,\nwhile all of the still large (in amplitude) nonaxisymmetric modes (m = 1 and m =\n2) are displaced to the galactic periphery. Subsequently (t \u2248 800 \u2212 1200 Myr), the\nnonaxisymmetric bending modes are gradually damped, while the axisymmetric bending\nreaches its maximum (t \u2248 1000 Myr).\nFor the subsequent 1500 Myr of its evolution, the disk freezes in a shape similar to the\nshape of circles on water. A similar vertical disk structure, with box-shaped iosphotes in\ncentral regions, was also observed in the numerical simulations of Sellwood and Merritt\n(1994) for initially hot Kuzmin \u2013 Toomre disk models and in other simulations in which\nthe bar formation was suppressed through a large Toomre parameter Q (Patsis et al.\n2002). In our computations, the amplitude of the axisymmetric bending slowly decreased\nand, to all appearances, the bending must subsequently disappear altogether.\nTwo evolutionary stages of the bending can be separated in this model: the initial\nstage with a nonaxisymmetric bending and the main stage with an axisymmetric bending.\nLet us turn to the plot of the vertical (\u03c3z ) and radial (\u03c3R ) velocity dispersions against\ntime (Fig. 3a). The value of \u03c3z approximately doubled in time t = 3000 Myr. Two times\nof rapid increase in the velocity dispersion \u03c3z can be distinguished: one at t \u2248 500 Myr\n(the time the amplitude of the initial nonaxisymmetric bending reaches its maximum)\nand the other at t \u2248 1000 \u2212 1200 Myr (the time the amplitude of the main axisymmetric\nbending reaches its maximum). As we see, the two times of change in \u03c3z are closely\nrelated to the characteristic growth stages of bending instability. Such a relationship\nexists in all of the models without bars in which bending instability developed. Thus, we\ncan conclude that in this model, the bending instability is responsible for the increase in\n\u03c3z ; when the bell (m = 0) mode appears, the energy of the random stellar velocity in the\ndisk plane is converted most effectively into the energy of random vertical motions.\nNote that the integrated quantities \u03c3z and \u03c3R calculated for the entire galaxy were\nused to construct the plots in Fig. 3. These quantities allow us to judge only the general\nrun of the processes in the disk. Figure 4 shows the radial profiles of the azimuthally\naveraged \u03c3z for various times. We see that the relaxation effect is most pronounced for\ncentral regions.\nIn Fig. 5, the \u03c3z /\u03c3R ratio is plotted against R for several times (here, we also averaged\n\u03c3z /\u03c3R in concentric rings). We can conclude from our data that the saturation level of\nthe bending instability in a region of about two exponential disk scale lengths in size\n(about 7 \u2013 7.5 kpc) ismuch higher than its level predicted by the linear criterion (3). For\nthese regions, \u03c3z /\u03c3R \u2248 0.4 \u2212 0.8.\nIn Figs.\n1 and 2 (right panels), the edge-on image of a model galaxy is\nrepresented by isophotes for several times.\nThe image was vertically magnified by a factor of 4.\nAs a result, the disk bending is clearly seen.\nNote\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: Model 26 1.

The integrated quantities referred\nto the entire galaxy are plotted: (a) Model 26 1; (b) Model 8 1; and (c) Model 9 1.\n\nthat the galactic evolution at late stages gives rise to a family of X-shaped orbits in central regions of the disk (t = 1200, 1400, 3000; the left frames; the Xshaped structures are more clearly seen on the pseudoimage of the model galaxy,\nhttp://www.astro.spbu.ru/staff/seger/articles/warps 2002/fig1 web.html). The main\naxisymmetric bending may be saturated at a galaxy thickness at which a resonance\narises between the frequencies of the stellar oscillations across the disk and in the rotation plane. This resonance can produce X-shaped orbits, which have repeatedly been\nobserved in numerical simulations (Combes et al. 1990; Pfenninger and Friedli 1991;\nPatsis et al. 2002).\nIn other models, the initial and main bends manifested themselves differently that\nthose in Model 26 1. The behavior of all models can be assigned to one of the following\ncases.\n(1) Both the initial and main bends arose almost simultaneously. In the long run,\nonly the axisymmetric bending survived. Abrupt disk heating took place at the time the\nbending amplitude was increasing. This scenario was observed for initially thin galaxies,\ni.e., for the models that started from initial conditions far from the linear saturation\nlevel. Almost all of the models with Q8.5 = 2.0 and z0 < 0.3 kpc show such a pattern of\nevolution.\n(2) The occurrences of the initial and main bends were well separated in time, as for\nModel 26 1 described in detail.\n(3) There was no initial bending at all, while the main bending could be observed\nat very late evolutionary stages. This scenario is characteristic of initially thick disks,\ni.e., of the models that started from conditions close to the instability saturation limit.\nThis result closely corresponds to the following theoretical result: at a given ratio of the\nmasses of the spherical and disk components, the mode with the azimuthal number m = 1\nbecomes stable earlier than the other modes as the disk thickness increases (Fridman\nand Polyachenko 1984). As the disk thickness increases further, the m = 2 mode is\nultimately saturated and the m = 0 mode remains at the fore. Note that the results of\n11\n\n\fFigure 4: Model 26 1. \u03c3z versus R for several times.\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5: \u03c3z /\u03c3R versus R for several times: Models 26 1 and 8 1.\n\n13\n\n\four numerical simulations and the theoretical calculations of Fridman and Polyachenko\n(1984) are inconsistent with the conclusions of Merrit and Sellwood (1994). These authors\nargue that the m = 0 mode is primarily stabilized in thick (radially hot) disks and the\nm = 1 mode must remain at the fore. In our numerical simulations, as the disk thickened,\nthe growth rate of the m = 0 mode decreased sharply. A low-amplitude m = 1 mode\nwas initially observed against the background of a slowly growing m = 0 mode; after the\nm = 1 mode displaced to the periphery, an axisymmetric bending clearly showed up. The\nvertical velocity dispersion in thick models began to increase only after the axisymmetric\nbending developed. Thus, for example, the disk bending in Model 32 was observed only\n3000 Myr after the beginning of the evolution.\n(4) In some of the models in which a bar was formed, only a small increase in the\nvertical velocity dispersion was associated with the initial bending of the entire disk.\nThis applies to all of the models with Q8.5 = 1.5 and z0 < 0.3 kpc. For thicker galaxies,\nno initial bending of the entire disk whatsoever was observed. In all of the models with\nQ8.5 = 1.5, the bending instability of the bar itself, which is investigated in the next\nsubsection, was the leading heating mechanism.\nThe Bending Instability of Bars. The second vertical disk heating mechanism\nrevealed by our numerical simulations is related to the bending instability of bars. A bar\nbending was first detected by Raha et al. in three-dimensional numerical simulations. Its\nappearance was explained by the development of firehose instability in the bar. In our\nsimulations, this instability was responsible for the secular disk heating almost in all of\nthe models with bars4 .\nConsider the disk evolution scenario using Model 8 1 as an example. The main\nevolutionary stages of the bending in this initially moderately hot model are shown in\nthe color two-dimensional histograms (Fig. 6 and 7). At early stages (t \u2248 200 \u2212 400\nMyr), the initial bending of the entire disk comes to the fore (the group of frames in the\nmiddle column). Gradually, the initial bending perturbation reaches its saturation level,\nis drifted to the galactic periphery, and decays (t \u2248 600 Myr). A distinct bar has already\nbeen formed in the galaxy by this time (Figs. 6 and 7; the group of left frames; all images\nwere oriented in such a way that the bar major axis was horizontal). At t \u2248 800 Myr,\nthe bending is generated already in the bar. At t \u2248 1000 Myr, its amplitude reaches a\nmaximum, after which the bending perturbation rapidly decays (t \u2248 1200 \u2212 1600 Myr).\nThe bar bending effect becomes understandable if we look at the group of right frames\nin Figs. 6 and 7. The shades of gray in these figures\nindicate the disk thickness in different\nq\n2\n\ndisk regions. The thickness was calculated as z 2 (R, \u03c6) \u2212 z(R, \u03c6) . We see that the bar\nwas much thinner than the rest of the galaxy, which can be explained as follows. Since\nmost of the disk stars were captured into the bar, it has a high surface density. Self-gravity\ncauses the disk to become thinner in the bar region, which gives rise to a bending.\nIf we look at the plot of the vertical velocity dispersion against time (Fig. 3b), then\n4\n\nIn some of the models that started from Q8.5 = 2.0, despite the large velocity dispersion in the disk\nplane, a distinct bar was formed at late stages. However, by this time, the vertical velocity dispersion\nwas so large (because of the relaxation associated with the bending instability of the entire disk) that\nno bending was formed in the bar.\n\n14\n\n\fwe will see the curve rises twice: first at t \u2248 200 Myr, which is clearly associated with the\nappearance of the initial bending of the entire disk, and, second, at t \u2248 1000 \u2212 1200 Myr,\nwhich coincides with the time the amplitude of the bar bending reaches its maximum.\nIn Fig. 5, \u03c3z /\u03c3R is plotted against R for several times. We see that for relatively cold\ndisks (as in the case of hot disks; Fig. 5, Model 26 1), the general saturation level of\nthe bending instability is higher than the linear level ((3). Merrit and Sellwood (1994)\npointed out that moderately hot models (Q \u223c 1) behave virtually as predicted by the\nlinear theory. Large deviations take place only for hot models. In our simulations, we\nobserved a similar picture. The saturation level of the bending instability associated\nwith the entire disk in the models with Q8.5 = 1.5 is close to the linear level (see Fig. 5,\nt = 800, Model 8 1). However, when the bending instability of the forming bar came into\neffect, the final vertical disk heating was almost the same as that for the models with\nQ8.5 = 2.0 (see Fig. 5, t = 3000, Models 26 1 and 8 1).\nFor the remaining models with Q8.5 = 1.5 and a low dark-halo mass\n(Mh (4h)/Md (4h) < 1), we observed the same growth stages of bending perturbations\nas those in Model 8 1. If a bar was formed in the disk, then bending instability sooner or\nlater began to develop in it. The bending amplitude rapidly increased and the instability\nwas ultimately saturated (all of these processes took place on time scales of the order of\none billion years). Note that even the bending shape was in each case similar to that\nobserved in Model 8 1. The models differed only by the bar formation time and by the\nduration of the stage that preceded the onset of bending formation in the bar itself. The\nlarger was the dark-halo mass, the later the bar was formed and the farther was the time\nof bending generation in the bar from this time. The larger was the initial disk thickness,\nthe later the bar was formed.\nStellar Relaxation in Models with a Massive Halo. Consider the stellar relaxation for models with a massive halo. A massive spherical component is known to\neffectively suppress the growth of bar-like instability (Ostriker and Peebles 1973) and to\nhave a stabilizing effect on the growth of bending perturbations (Zasov et al. 1991; Sellwood 1996). The stellar relaxation in such models (if it takes place) must be produced\nby some other factors. Let us trace the evolution of the vertical structure of a stellar disk\nembedded in a massive halo using Model 9 1 as an example.\nBecause of the presence of a massive spheroidal component in the galaxy, the bending\ninstability of its disk was suppressed. No bar was formed either (at least on a time\nscale of 5 Gyr). Since a massive halo primarily stabilizes the disk against the growth of\nperturbations in the disk plane with azimuthal numbers m \u2264 2, higher-order modes come\nto the fore. They manifest themselves in the form of multiple shortlived spiral waves and\npersist in the disk for several disk rotations (see, e.g., the left frame in Fig. 8). Their\namplitude is initially large but the spiral pattern is blurred almost completely by the\ntime t = 3000 Myr.\nTransient spirals are produced by collective processes and they are responsible for the\nheating of the disk in its plane. This relationship was first pointed out by Sellwood and\nCarlberg (1984). In Fig. 3c, the radial (\u03c3R ) and vertical (\u03c3z ) velocity dispersions are\nplotted against time. As would be expected, the rate of increase in the radial velocity\ndispersion slowly decreases with decreasing amplitude of the spiral arms and, after t =\n15\n\n\fFigure 6: Model 8 1. The evolution of a disk with Q8.5 = 1.5 early stages). In each row: the\nfirst frame shows the galaxy seen face-on (the image brightness corresponds to the logarithm\nof the number of particles per pixel); the second frame shows the mean disk particle deviation\nfrom the z = 0 plane (this value is represented by different colors: the shades of yellow and blue\nindicate upward and downward deviations, respectively; the deviation ranges from \u22120.5 to +0.5\nkpc); the third frame shows the two-dimensional galaxy thickness distribution (the thickness is\nindicated by the shades of gray: the lighter is the disk region, the thicker it is; the thickness\nranges from 0 to 1 kpc; the red point means that the thickness in this region is outside the\nrange). All pictures are oriented in such a way that the bar was located along the X axis. The\nframe size is 40 kpc \u00d7 40 kpc.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 7: Model 8 1. The same as Fig. 6 for late evolutionary stages.\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 8: Model 9 1. A snapshot of the galaxy at t = 660 and the two-dimensional disk\nthickness and \u03c3z distributions. The size of each frame is 40 \u00d7 40 kpc. The left frame shows\nthe galaxy seen face-on (the image brightness corresponds to the logarithm of the number of\nparticles per pixel). The middle frame shows the two-dimensional disk thickness distribution\nconstructed by using the shades of gray (the brighter the disk region, the larger its thickness at\na given location). The right frame shows the two-dimensional \u03c3z distribution over the galaxy;\n\u03c3z is indicates by the shades of gray (the velocity dispersion is larger in brighter regions).We see\nthat in the region of the spiral arms, the galaxy is thinner but the vertical velocity dispersion\nis larger. This effect is most pronounced for the two arms located in the lower right corner.\n\n1500 Myr, the stellar relaxation in the disk plane related to transient spiral perturbations\nbecomes ineffective. At the same time, for all five billion years of evolution, \u03c3z slowly\nincreases, although the rate of increase gradually decreases. The observed vertical secular\ndisk heating is not the result of numerical pair relaxation, because the levels and the\npatterns of increase of \u03c3z and \u03c3R differ greatly (\u03c3R is almost constant at late evolutionary\nstages). The cause of the increase of \u03c3z in our simulations is completely different.\nLet us analyze the vertical disk structure in more detail. Figure 8 shows three frames\nfor one of the times: the galaxy seen face-on, the two-dimensional disk thickness map,\nand the two-dimensional vertical velocity dispersion map. We clearly see from these\nframes that the disk thickness in the regions where the spiral arms are located is smaller\nthan the disk thickness in the interarm space. In other words, inhomogeneities in the\ndistribution of stars in the plane produce inhomogeneities in the vertical distribution\nof stars. The effect is similar in nature to the bar thinning described in the preceding\nsection: a self-gravitating disk is thinner where the surface density is higher.\nWe assume that the observed increase of the vertical velocity dispersion is related to\nthe scattering of stars by inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter in the z direction.\nApart from the above explanation, there are two more additional facts that are indicative\nof this.\nIf we look at the two-dimensional \u03c3z distribution (Fig. 8), then we can see that \u03c3z\nin the spiral arms is higher than that in the interarm space. In addition, it follows from\nour computations that the decrease in the rate of increase of \u03c3z well correlates with the\n18\n\n\fdecrease in the intensity of transient spirals.\nThus, we believe that the slow increase of the vertical velocity dispersion in our\ndescribed models is attributable to the scattering of stars by transient spiral perturbations. The latter produce inhomogeneities in the vertical distribution of matter due to\nself-gravity.\nVertical Secular Disk Heating Mechanisms. During our numerical stellardynamics simulations, we scanned the space of control parameters (the initial disk halfthickness, the degree of disk heating in the disk plane, and the relative mass of the\nspheroidal subsystem). A detailed analysis of our numerical results revealed three distinct mechanisms of secular disk heating in the z direction.\n(1) The large-scale bending instability of the entire disk.\n(2) The bending instability of bars.\n(3) The heating due to inhomogeneities in the vertical distribution of stars produced\nby matter inhomogeneities in the plane.\nThe action of a particular heating mechanism depends on the control parameters. If\nthe bar mode is suppressed in the galaxy, then the heating is attributable to the largescale bending instability associated with the entire disk. This is the case of a hot disk\n(Q8.5 > 1.5) and (or) a moderately massive halo. In this case, the heating of the central\nregions is particularly strong. The saturation level of the bending instability in these\nregions is almost a factor of 2.5 higher than the level that follows from the linear theory.\nThe bending mode with the azimuthal number m = 0 plays a key role in the secular\nheating. The time of its occurrence depends on the initial disk thickness: the thicker\nis the disk, the farther in time is the secondary rise in disk temperature related to the\ngrowth of the bell mode.\nIf a bar mode develops in the disk, then the bending instability of the bar gives the\nlargest contribution to the heating. Until a bar is formed, the maximum value of \u03c3z /\u03c3R\nis 0.37 in the central regions and 0.3 on the periphery. This is the level that the bending\ninstability associated with the entire disk reaches. It is in good agreement with the linear\ncriterion. After the formation of a bar, at the time of its bending in the central regions,\n\u03c3z /\u03c3R rises to 0.7 \u2013 0.8. The heating on vertical bar bending perturbations dominates in\ninitially moderately hot disks (Q8.5 = 1.5) with a low-mass halo.\nThe heating on vertical inhomogeneities take place when the bending modes and the\nbar mode were suppressed. This was observed for moderately hot models (Q8.5 = 1.5)\nwith a massive halo. Note that the secular disk heating in all directions in similar\nsimulations has been observed more than once. However, we are probably the first to\nassociate the increase of \u03c3z with the scattering of stars by vertical inhomogeneities.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have numerically analyzed the nonlinear growth stages of bending instability in\nstellar disks with exponential radial density profiles and found significant deviations from\nthe linear theory.\n(1) All of the observed modes are global; i.e., the scale of unstable perturbations is\nlarger than the typical scale of density variations in the disk. Our conclusion agrees\n19\n\n\fwith the conclusions of Sellwood (1996). It implies that, although the dispersion relation\n(1) derived for a homogeneous layer is also locally valid for inhomogeneous disks (in\nparticular, exponential disks, as in our numerical simulations), it would be inappropriate\nto use this relation to analyze the saturation level of long-wavelength perturbations. This\nalso suggests that bending instability will develop in inhomogeneous disks differently in\ndifferent parts of the galaxy.\n(2) The value of (\u03c3z /\u03c3R )cr \u2248 0.3 was obtained from a linear analysis. As our numerical\ncomputations show, the saturation level of large-scale bending perturbations is a factor\nof 2 or 3 higher than the linear level. The differences are best seen in central regions\nof the stellar disk. The lower the dark-halo mass, the higher the instability saturation\nlevel and the larger the ratio of the vertical and radial velocity dispersions averaged\nwithin two exponential disk scale lengths. A similar dependence was pointed out by\nMikhailova et al. (2001), although without discussing the underlying mechanisms. Earlytype spiral galaxies have, on average, a smaller dark-to-luminous mass ratio and, as\nfollows from the observational data given above, a larger value of \u03c3z /\u03c3R , in agreement\nwith our computations.\n(3) The instability saturation time scales are several billion years.\n(4) Our numerical simulations revealed three distinct mechanisms of the secular heating of stellar disks in the z direction. We confirmed the existence of bar bending instability\nthat was first detected by Raha et al. (1991). For a large series of models, we showed\nthat the bar bending is an inevitable stage of its evolution.\nThus, we can conclude that bending instability can play an important role in the\nsecular disk heating in the z direction.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the Program \"Leading Scientific Schools\" (project\nno. 00-15-96607), the Federal Program \"Astronomy\" (project no. 40.022.1.1.1101), and\nthe UR grant no. 02.01.006.\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] S.
