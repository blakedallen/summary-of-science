In this\nway, two distinct cases can be analysed: i) In the first one, the vortice is considered\nas being a thin linear topological defect, having a magnetic filed running along it.\nThis case can be treated analytically. ii) In the second case, we consider that the\nstring has the non-zero thickness. Analytically this problem becomes intractable.\nWe shall adopt here an intermediate approach. We shall use an approximated\nmodel, considering the spacetime produced by the vortice as being of a cosmic\nstring, however having a magnetic field confined into an infinitely long tube of\nradius R around it. In this way, some improvement is introduced when compared\nwith the ideal case. Because the configuration of vortice magnetic field can not\nexpressed analytically, in attempt to describe the real situation, we shall admit\nspecifics spacial behaviors for the magnetic field inside the tube. The magnetic\n~\nfield along z direction, can be represented by H(r)\n= H(r)\u1e91. Now, assuming that\nthe field is confined in a finite range in the radial coordinate, we are particularly\ninterested in the following two models:\ni) H(r) =\nii) H(r) =\n\n\u03a6\n\u0398(R \u2212 r), homogeneous field inside,\n\u03b1\u03c0R2\n\u03a6\n\u0398(R \u2212 r), field proportional to 1/r inside.\n2\u03c0\u03b1Rr\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere R is the radius extent of the tube, \u0398 is the Heaviside's function and \u03a6 is\nthe total flux. The ratio of the flux to the quantum flux \u03a6o , can be expressed by\n\u03b4 = \u03a6/\u03a60 = N + \u03b3, where N is the integer part and 0 < \u03b3 < 1.\nThe analysis of the behavior of the charged massless scalar field in the spacetime\nof an idealized cosmic string, considering these configurations of magnetics field, has\nbeen developed by Spinelly and Bezerra de Mello in [1, 2] at zero temperature.\nRecently, some authors have investigated the effects of temperature on the\nvacuum polarization effects in the cosmic string spacetime [3, 4, 5]. The standard\nprocedure to introduce temperature effects is by calculating the thermal Euclidean\nGreen function. This can be done for an ultrastatic spacetime1 by knowing of\nthe Green function at zero temperature and applying the Schwinger-De Witt\nprescription [6].\nBecause we already know the Euclidean Green function at zero temperature\n[1, 2], we shall adopt this prescription for obtain the thermal Green function.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In the section 2 we shall calculate the\nEuclidean thermal Green function associated with a charged massless scalar field\non this system. In the section 3, using the results obtained in the last section, we\nshall calculate the thermal renormalized vacuum expectation value of the square of\nthe charged massless scalar field, h\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iRen. . Finally, we leave for the section\n4 our conclusions.\n1\n\nAn ultrastatic spacetime admits a globally defined coordinate system in which the components of the\nmetric tensor are time independent and the conditions g00 = 1 and g0i = 0 hold\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Euclidean thermal Green function\n\nThe Green function associated with the charged massless scalar field at zero\ntemperature, must obey the following non-homogeneous second-order differential\nequation\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003\n\u2032\n1\n\u221a D\u03bc \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bd G(x, x ) = \u2212\u03b4(4) (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) ,\n(3)\n\u2212g\nwhere D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc , been A\u03bc = (0, 0, A(r), 0).\nIn order to reproduce the configurations of magnetic fields given by (1) and (2),\nwe must write the third component of the vector potential by\nA=\n\n\u03a6\na(r) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nFor the two models considered, we can represent the radial function a(r) by:\na(r) = f (r)\u0398(R \u2212 r) + \u0398(r \u2212 R) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith\nf (r) =\n\n(\n\nr 2 /R2 , for model (i) and\nr/R,\nfor model (ii).\n\n(6)\n\nOn the other hand, we assume in our approach that the spacetime produced by\nthe vortice will be the idealized cosmic string one, which, in cylindrical coordinate,\nreads\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + dr 2 + \u03b12 r 2 d\u03b8 2 + dz 2 ,\n(7)\nwhere the parameter \u03b1 is smaller than unity and codify the presence of a conical\ntwo-surface (r, \u03b8).\nFor the models 1 and 2, the solutions of the equation (3), for points outside the\nmagnetic flux, i.e., for r > R, are given by [2]:\nGjT =0 (x, x\u2032 ) =\n+\n\nei\u2206\u03b8 sinh(\u03b3u0 /\u03b1) + sinh[(1 \u2212 \u03b3)u0 /\u03b1]\neiN \u2206\u03b8\n8\u03c0 2 \u03b1rr \u2032 sinh u0\ncosh(u0 /\u03b1) \u2212 cos \u2206\u03b8\n\u0013\n\u0012 q\nZ \u221e\n1\n2 + (\u2206z)2 \u00d7\n\u03c9\nd\u03c9\u03c9J\n(\u2206\u03c4\n)\n0\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1 0\n\u221e\nX\n\nein\u2206\u03b8 Dnj (\u03c9R)K|\u03bd| (\u03c9r)K|\u03bd| (\u03c9r \u2032 ),\n\nj = 1, 2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03bd = (n \u2212 \u03b4)/\u03b1,\n\u20322\n\nr 2 + r + (\u2206\u03c4 )2 + (\u2206z)2\ncosh uo =\n2rr \u2032\nand\nDnj (\u03c9R)\n\n=\n\n\u2032 (\u03c9R)\nHj\u2032 (R)I|\u03bd| (\u03c9R) \u2212 Hj (R)I|\u03bd|\n\nHj (R)K|\u03bd| (\u03c9R) \u2212 Hj\u2032 (R)K|\u03bd| (\u03c9R)\n\u2032\n\n(9)\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nIn the above equations the functions Hj (r) are given by:\n1\nH1 (r) = M\u03c31 ,\u03bb1\nr\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4 2\nr ,\n\u03b1R2\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n\n\fwith \u03c31 = ( \u03b1n \u2212\n\n\u03c9 2 R2 \u03b1\n2\u03b4 )/2\n\nand \u03bb1 = n/2\u03b1, and\n1\nH2 (r) = \u221a M\u03c32 ,\u03bb2 (\u03b6r) ,\nr\n\n(12)\n\n2\n2 2 2 \u22121/2 , \u03bb = n/\u03b1 and \u03b6 = 2 (\u03b4 2 + \u03c9 2 R2 \u03b12 )1/2 .

In order to do this, we\nshall take the coincidence limit of the respective Green function. However, this result\nis divergent. In order to obtain a finite and well defined result, we must apply some\nrenormalization procedure. Here we shall adopt the point-splitting renormalization\none. It has been observed that the singular behavior of the Green function has the\nsame structure as given by the Hadamard one, which on the other hand can be\nwritten in terms of the square of the geodesic distance between two points. So, here\nwe shall adopt the following prescription: we subtract from the Green function the\nHadamard one before applying the coincidence limit as shown below:\nh\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Ren. =\n\nh\n\ni\n\nlim\nGjT (x, x\u2032 ) \u2212 GH (x, x\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\nx \u2192x\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\nC\n= h\u03c6\u0302 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Reg. + h\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iC\nT =0 + h\u03c6\u0302 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT .(16)\n\n4\n\n\fThe first term on the right side of the above expression, represents the thermal\ncontribution coming from the interaction between charged massless scalar field with\na magnetic flux considered as a flux line running along the cosmic string.

On other hand we observe that we can change the exact expressions of\nthe coefficients Dnj (vR/r) by the approximated one.

However, through a\nnumerical analysis we can determine dependence of this sums depend with the\ntemperature. Considering R/r = 10\u22123 , \u03b3 = 0.2 and \u03b1 = 0.99, we have that the\nbehaviors of the sums Sj (r), for high temperature, are given by figure bellow.\n\nFigure 1: Dependence of the sum Sj with \u03be = \u03b2/r, for the models 1 and 2.\nIn this case the dependence of Sj with \u03be is\nSj (r) =\n\naj\n= aj\n\u03beb\n\n\u0012 \u0013b\n\nr\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\nj = 1, 2 .\n\n(27)\n\nFor the first model we found:\na1 = 0, 02465 \u00b1 0, 0003 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhile for the second model we found\na2 = 0, 02231 \u00b1 0.0003 .\n\n(29)\n\nFor both models the value for the exponent b are equal and reads:\nb = 0.99255 \u00b1 0, 00325 .\n\n(30)\n\nIn the high-temperature regime (\u03b2 \u2192 0), the expression (17) becomes [5]\nh\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Reg. \u2248\n\n6\n\n1\nM (\u03b3)\n,\n+\n2\n12\u03b2\n\u03b2r\n\n(31)\n\n\fwhere the constant M (\u03b3) is defined by\nM (\u03b3) =\n\n1\n16\u03c0 2 \u03b1\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n(\u03b3)\n\nF\u03b1 (u, 0)\n.\ncosh(u/2)\n\nHence, the expression for renormalized vacuum expectation value of the square\nof the charged massless scalar field, in the high-temperature limit, is given by\nh\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Ren. \u2248\n\n1\n1\naj\nM (\u03b3)\n+ 2 2\u2212b b ,\n+\n2\n12\u03b2\n\u03b2r\n2\u03c0 \u03b1 r \u03b2\n\n(32)\n\nConsidering \u03b3 = 0.2 and \u03b1 = 0.99, we have that M (\u03b3) = \u22120.0129973.\n\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper we have analysed the thermal effects on the renormalized vacuum\nexpectation value of a charged massless scalar field, h\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)i, in the cosmic\nstring spacetime considering the presence of a magnetic flux of finite radius. Two\nspecific configurations of magnetic flux have been considered. For both we can\nexpress the vacuum polarization as\n\u2217\nC\nh\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Ren. = h\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT,Reg. + h\u03c6\u0302\u2217 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iC\nT =0 + h\u03c6\u0302 (x)\u03c6\u0302(x)iT ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side represents the thermal contribution\ncoming from the idealized magnetic flux running along the cosmic string. This\ncontribution has been exactly calculated by Guimar\u00e3es in [5]. The second term\nis the zero temperature contribution on the vacuum polarization due to the non\nvanishing radius of the magnetic flux tube. This contribution has been analysed\nin [2]. The third contribution is the new one. It comes from the combination of\nthe non vanishing radius of the magnetic flux tube and non zero temperature. It\ngoes to zero for R \u2192 0 and for T \u2192 0. Unfortunately this new contribution cannot\nbe expressed in terms of any analytical function. So, for both configuration of\nmagnetic flux, we observed numerically that in the high temperature regime, the\nthermal contributions due to them present a dependence on the parameter \u03be = \u03b2/r\napproximately given by 1/\u03be. This means that these contributions are subdominant\nin the high temperature regime.\n\nAcknowledgment\nOne of us (ERBM) wants to thanks Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq.), and also CNPq./FAPESQ-PB (PRONEX), for\npartial financial support.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
