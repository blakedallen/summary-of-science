Beltram\nA hybrid superconductor\u2013two-dimensional electron gas microdevice is presented. Its working\nprinciple is based on the suppression of Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor\ninterface caused by a magnetic barrier generated by a ferromagnetic strip placed on top of the\nstructure. Device switching is predicted with fields up to some mT and working frequencies of\nseveral GHz, making it promising for applications ranging from microswitches and storage cells to\nmagnetic field discriminators.\nPACS numbers: 74.45.+c, 73.20.-r, 73.23.-b, 73.40.-c\n\nNormal metal-superconductor (NS) junctions show peculiar low-voltage transport properties due to the presence of the superconducting gap that can be exploited for\nseveral electronic applications [1] ranging from superconducting interferometry [2] and nonvolatile storage-cell engineering [3, 4, 5] to microrefrigeration [6] and Josephsoneffect devices [7]. In these systems electronic transport is\nmediated by Andreev reflection [8] for subgap voltages.\nThis is a scattering process occurring at the NS interface\nconsisting of the coherent evolution of an electron into\na retro-reflected hole thus describing the injection of a\nCooper pair into the condensate. In the tunneling regime\nand at low temperatures subgap conductance is drastically suppressed with respect to the normal-state. Subgap conductance can therefore be effectively controlled\nby tuning Andreev reflection. This is of interest not only\nfrom the fundamental physics point of view, but also for\nits potential impact on nanoelectronics applications.\nIn this Letter we propose a hybrid superconductorsemiconductor device whose subgap conductance can be\ncontrolled by changing the strength of a magnetic barrier induced by a ferromagnetic strip. The simplicity of\nthe structure together with the mature superconductorsemiconductor junction technology [9] make this system\npromising for a number of electronic applications.\nA sketch of our device is shown in Fig. 1(a). It consists of a superconductor\u2013two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) ballistic junction. The superconducting interface is located at x = 0, and transport occurs along the\nx axis. On top of the junction a ferromagnetic strip of\nwidth d and thickness h is deposited. It has a homogeneous magnetization M and occupies the region defined\nby \u2212d/2 \u2264 x \u2264 d/2 and \u2212h/2 \u2264 z \u2264 h/2 (note that the\norigin of the z axis is at the mid-height of the ferromagnetic strip and z0 is the position of the 2DEG plane).\nElectron transport in the 2DEG is affected by the perpendicular magnetic field generated by the x-component\nof the magnetization Mx = |M| cos \u03c6. The z-component\nof the magnetic field has the profile of a double magnetic\nbarrier [10, 11] whose strength can be tuned by rotating\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: f.giazotto@sns.it\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c6\nM\nz\n\nS\ny\n\nh\nw\n\nF\n\nB\nx\n\n0.3\n\nd\n\nBz/\u03bc0Mx\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0508058v2 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 3 Feb 2006\n\nNEST CNR-INFM and Scuola Normale Superiore, I-56126 Pisa, Italy\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n2-DEG\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nx(\u03bcm)\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic view of the proposed\ndevice. The superconductor-2DEG junction conductance is\ncontrolled by the fringe field generated by a ferromagnetic\nstrip placed on top of the structure. The strength of the\nmagnetic barrier in the two-dimensional electron gas can be\nvaried by changing the orientation of the magnetization (M).\n(b) Spatial profile of the Bz -component of the magnetic fringe\nfield for z0 = 185 nm, h = 300 nm, and d = 1.5 \u03bcm. The\ntransport direction is x.\n\nthe magnetization of the ferromagnet (hence, by varying\nMx ). The z-component of the magnetic field in the 2DEG\nplane, in the limit\n\u0010 h \u226a z0 and h \u226a d, is given by\n\u0011 [10]:\n\u03bc0\nh\nBz (x) = 2\u03c0 Mx d K(x + d/2, z0 ) \u2212 K(x \u2212 d/2, z0 ) \u03b8(x),\n\nwith K(x, z) = \u2212zd/(x2 +z 2 ), \u03b8(x) the step function, and\n\u03bc0 the magnetic permeability of vacuum. An example of\nthe magnetic barrier profile is shown in Fig. 1(b). Note\nthat one of the peaks is located deep in the superconductor region and does not affect the transport properties of\nthe interface. Although the above expression for the magnetic field has been derived for h \u226a z0 , it is still a very\ngood approximation even when h and z0 are of the same\norder [11], and we shall use it throughout this Letter. If\nthe energy of quasiparticles contributing to transport is\nsmaller than the superconducting gap, transport is mediated by Andreev reflection. As will be shown in the following, the presence of the magnetic barrier can suppress\nAndreev reflection, and hence the subgap conductance.\nA setup similar to the one presented here was proposed\nand realized in the context of all-metal superconducting\nweak links [2, 3, 4, 5]. The working principle, however,\nwas different and in those structures the magnetic fringe\nfield was used to locally quench superconductivity.\n\n\f2\nIn order to study electron transport in the structure\nwe make use of the the Bogolubov-de Gennes equation\n[12]:\n\u0012 \u03c3\u0013\n\u0012 \u03c3\n\u0013\u0012 \u03c3 \u0013\nu\nH0 \u2206(x)\nu\n,\n(1)\n=\nE\nv \u2212\u03c3\n\u2206(x) \u2212H0\u03c3 \u2217\nv \u2212\u03c3\n\n1\nH0\u03c3 = (p\u2212eA(x))\n(p\u2212eA(x))+V\u03c3 (x)+U (x)\u2212\u01ebF,S ,\n2m(x)\n(2)\n~ A(x) = Ay (x)\u0177 is the vector potenwhere p = \u2212i~\u2207,\ntial in the London gauge, e the electron charge, u and\nv are the coherence factors, and \u03c3 = \u00b11 is the spin.\nThe excitation energy E is measured from the condensate chemical potential \u01ebF,S . The potential U describes\nthe subband-bottom mismatch between the superconductor and the 2DEG. Zeeman splitting V\u03c3 (x) is given by\nV\u03c3 (x) = 21 \u03c3g2DEG \u03bcB B(x), where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, and g2DEG the effective g-factor. The electron\nmass and the pairing potential are given, respectively, by\nm(x) = m2DEG \u03b8(x) + m0 \u03b8(\u2212x) and \u2206(x) = \u2206\u03b8(\u2212x).\nWithin the Landauer-Buttiker scattering approach [13]\nthe junction finite-temperature differential conductance\nis given by:\nZ\nXh\ne2 +\u221e\nG(V ) =\nN +\u03c3 (E) \u2212 R0+\u03c3 (E) +\ndE\nh \u2212\u221e\n\u03c3\ni\u0010 \u2202f (E \u2212 eV ) \u0011\n,\n(3)\nRa+\u03c3 (E) \u2212\n\u2202E\nwhere R0+\u03c3 (Ra+\u03c3 ) is the normal (Andreev) reflection\nprobability for spin-\u03c3 quasiparticles, N +,\u03c3 is the number\nof open electron channels in the junction, and f is the\nequilibrium Fermi distribution at temperature T . The\nscattering amplitudes are numerically evaluated by a recursive Green's function technique within a tight-binding\ndescription of the system [14]. In order to simulate a realistic S-2DEG structure we assumed w = 0.5 \u03bcm, d = 1.5\n\u03bcm, z0 = 185 nm, h = 300 nm, and g2DEG = \u221220.\nWithin the tight-binding scheme, H0\u03c3 is a matrix characterized by on-site energies at each site i (\u01ebi0 ) and hopping\npotentials between nearest-neighbors sites (\u03b3ij ). In particular, in order to describe the different band structures\nin S and the 2DEG, we have taken \u01eb2DEG\n= 15.97 eV,\n0\n\u01ebS0 = 2.4 eV, \u03b3 2DEG = 4.0 eV, and \u03b3 S = 1.0 eV. The\nparameters chosen for the semiconductor region are suitable for an InAs [15] or In0.75 Ga0.25 As [16] 2DEG with\ncharge density \u2243 4.4 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , and effective mass\nm2DEG = 0.035 m0 . \u2206 is a diagonal matrix with nonzero and constant elements (\u22060 ) only in S. \u22060 is assumed to follow the BCS temperature dependence, and\nwe chose aluminum (Al) as the superconducting electrode\n(\u22060 (T = 0) = 180 \u03bceV). With the parameters given\nabove the junction normal-state resistance for Bz = 0 is\nRN \u223c 3.2 k\u03a9.\nThe results of our calculations are shown in Fig. 2 for\n\u03bc0 M = 1.8 T (i.e., the saturation magnetization typical\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nkBT/\u22060\n0\n0.025\n0.1\n0.2\n0.4\n0.5\n\n5\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n10\n\nG(e2/h)\n\nwith\n\n2\n\n10\n\no\n\n4\n\n90\no\n70\no\n43\no\n39\no\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n-4\n\n10\n\n1\no\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nT=0\n-6\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\neV/\u22060\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\neV/\u22060\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Differential conductance G vs bias\nvoltage at T = 0 and \u03bc0 M = 1.8 T for several angles \u03c6.

As expected, the conductance shows very different behavior for |eV | < \u22060 and |eV | > \u22060 . When\nthe peak of the fringe field grows by lowering the magnetization angle, the subgap conductance is drastically\nsuppressed (down to zero within the numerical error).\nThe normal-state conductance is much less affected and\nis reduced at most by a factor \u223c 3 at \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 . For magnetic barrier strengths exceeding the critical value (with\nthe chosen parameters, around \u03c6 = 39\u25e6 ) the S-2DEG\ncontact thus behaves like an ideal superconducting tunnel junction showing a subgap conductance several orders\nof magnitude smaller than in the normal state [17]. By\nincreasing the temperature (see Fig. 2(b)) the junction\nG(V ) characteristic resembles that of an S-insulator-N\ntunnel contact, i.e., the subgap conductance increases,\nreaching the normal-state value at the superconductor\ncritical temperature.\nThe physical origin of this suppression of Andreev reflection can be easily understood within a semiclassical\npicture (see Fig. 3(a)). For simplicity let us consider vanishing bias voltage V and temperature, so that transport\noccurs at the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we assume a\nmagnetic field such that B(x) = B \u1e91 for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a,\nand B(x) = 0 elsewhere. Let us consider an electron\n(e) propagating in the xy plane and impinging on the\nmagnetic barrier at an angle \u03b8i . When the cyclotron\nradius is larger than a, the electron leaves the barrier\nat an angle \u03b8e , and it is reflected as a hole (h) at the\nS-N interface (within this simplified description we can\nneglect normal reflection). After crossing the magnetic\nbarrier, the hole propagates at an angle \u03b8o related to \u03b8i\nc\nby sin \u03b8o \u2212 sin \u03b8i = 2a\u03c9\nvF , where vF is the Fermi velocity in\nthe 2DEG, and \u03c9c = |eB|/m2DEG .

On the other hand Andreev reflection is suppressed if the incident angle reaches\n\u2212sign(eB)\u03c0/2. Hence, the critical field value (B c ) leading to the suppression of Andreev reflection satisfies the\nrelation\na|eB c |\n= 1.\nm2DEG vF\n\n(4)\n\nHere it is important to point out that, for a s-wave superconductor, interface roughness, which occurs on the\natomic length scale, will virtually have no effect on Andreev reflection [8, 18], the latter being determined by\nelectron-hole correlations which extend on a much larger\nlength scale.\nBy controlling the intensity of the magnetic barrier\nit is thus possible to have access to different transport\nregimes in the same structure. We can tune transport\nfrom that typical of a relatively transparent junction to\nan exponentially suppressed subgap conductance, a behavior typical of a tunnel junction. The main difference\nbetween the present approach and a conventional barrier,\ne.g., a thin oxide layer or a barrier produced by electrostatic gating, is that the fringe field strongly affects\nthe contact subgap conductance in the superconducting\nstate, but marginally alters the junction normal-state resistance [19]. The full switching behavior of the junction\nis shown in Fig. 3(b) which displays the normalized zerobias differential conductance (RN G0 ) vs cos(\u03c6) at T = 0\nand \u03bc0 M = 1.8 T.

Lett. 79, 2486\n\nA first obvious application of the proposed structure is\nthe implementation of a magnetic switch, by taking advantage of the narrow transition in the G0 (\u03c6) curve and of\nthe large (RN G0 )\u22121 value (see Fig. 3(b)). Additionally,\nthe system could be operated as a magnetic field discriminator. In such a configuration, the junction should be\nset near the transition point with a properly chosen fringe\nfield (i.e., at a suitable angle \u03c6); then, any additional external magnetic field would trigger the device to switch.\nAlso the implementation of nonvolatile storage cells can\nbe easily envisioned: M can be rotated from \u03c6 = 0 to\n\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 through metallic write wires, along the lines of\nRefs. [2, 3, 4, 5], while the junction state is maintained\nwith zero applied power by the remnant magnetization\nand is nonvolatile, even at temperatures larger than the\ncritical temperature of the superconductor.\nWe should like to summarize the essential requirements\ntoward a realistic implementation of the device: (i) a\nsemiconductor -based hybrid structure is required. It allows to overcome the difficulty of achieving complete Andreev suppression with an all-metal system (from Eq. (4)\nit follows that unrealistically-high fringe fields would be\nrequired to suppress the Andreev reflection with normal\nmetals); (ii) any Schottky barrier at the S-2DEG contact should be avoided, in order to minimize the junction normal-state resistance. In light of these considerations, 2DEGs made in the InAs [15] or Inx Ga1\u2212x As (with\nx \u2265 0.75) [16] systems are ideal candidates for the Sm region, and Al or Nb could be used for the S electrode. As\nfar as the ferromagnetic element is concerned, a Permalloy (Ni0.8 Fe0.2 ) [3, 4], Co or Co90 Fe10 [2, 5] thin layer\ncould provide magnetizations (\u03bc0 M ) ranging from 1 to 2\nT. Furthermore, M can be rotated by externally applying an in-plane static magnetic field as low as some 10\u22123\nT [2, 3, 4, 5], while its rotation frequency (determining\nthe device speed) might be pushed up to several GHz\nallowing, in principle, fast operation [20].\nIn conclusion, we proposed a superconductor-2DEG\nhybrid microstructure that exploits the magnetic fringe\nfield generated by a ferromagnetic strip to control the\nAndreev reflection at the superconductor\u2013semiconductor\ninterface. This system shows a high potential for device applications ranging from fast switches and magnetic\nfield discriminators to nonvolatile storage cells.\nPartial financial support from MIUR under FIRB program RBNEO1FSWY is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n(2001).\n[3] T.
