The effect occurs for language, too,\nranging from matching of acoustic features such as\naccent, speech rate, and pitch (Giles et al., 1991;\nChartrand and van Baaren, 2009) to lexico-syntactic\npriming across adjacent or nearby utterances (Bock,\n1986; Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Ward and Litman, 2007; Reitter et al., 2011).\nOur work focuses on adjacent-utterance coordination with respect to classes of function words. To exemplify the phenomenon, we discuss two short conversations.\n\u2022 First example: The following exchange from the\nmovie \"The Getaway\" (1972) demonstrates quantifier coordination.\nDoc: At least you were outside.\nCarol: It doesn't make much difference where you are [...]\n\nNote that \"Carol\" used a quantifier, one that is different than the one \"Doc\" employed. Also, notice that\n\"Carol\" could just as well have replied in a way that\ndoesn't include a quantifier, for example, \"It doesn't\nreally matter where you are...\".\n\u2022 Second example: Levelt and Kelter (1982) report\nan experiment involving preposition coordination.\nShopkeepers who were called and asked \" At what\ntime does your shop close?\" were significantly more\nlikely to say \" At five o'clock\" than \"five o'clock\".2\nman chameleon\" uncontrollably takes on the characteristics of\nthose around him. The term is meant to contrast with \"aping\",\na word connoting intentional imitation.\nRelated terms include adaptation, alignment, entrainment,\npriming, and Du Bois' dialogic syntax.\n2\nThis is an example of lexical matching manifested as part\nof syntactic coordination.\n\n\fCoordination of function-word class has been previously documented in several settings (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002; Taylor and Thomas,\n2008; Ireland et al., 2011; Gonzales et al., 2010),\nthe largest-scale study being on Twitter (DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2011).\nProblem setting People don't consciously track\nfunction words (Levelt and Kelter, 1982; Segalowitz\nand Lane, 2004; Petten and Kutas, 1991) - it's not\neasy to answer the question, \"how many prepositions were there in the sentence I just said?\". Therefore, it is quite striking that humans nonetheless instantly adapt to each other's function-word rates. Indeed, there is active debate regarding what mechanisms cause nonconscious coordination (Ireland et\nal., 2011; Branigan et al., 2010).\nOne line of thought is that convergence represents\na social strategy3 whose aim is to gain the other's social approval (Giles, 2008; Street and Giles, 1982)\nor enhance the other's comprehension (Clark, 1996;\nBortfeld and Brennan, 1997).4 This hypothesis is\nsupported by studies showing that coordination is affected by a number of social factors, including relative social status (Natale, 1975; Gregory and Webster, 1996; Thakerar et al., 1982) and gender role\n(Bilous and Krauss, 1988; Namy et al., 2002; Ireland and Pennebaker, 2010).\nBut an important question is whether the adaptation mechanism has become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to have\ntransformed into a reflex not requiring any social\ntriggering.5\nIndeed, it has been argued that unconscious mimicry is partly innate (Chartrand and\nBargh, 1999), perhaps due to evolutionary pressure\nto foster relationships (Lakin et al., 2003).\nTo answer this question, we take a radical approach: we consider a setting in which the persons generating the coordinating dialog are different\nfrom those engaged in the dialog (and standing to\nreap the social benefits) - imagined conversations,\nspecifically, scripted movie dialogs.\n3\n\nIn fact, social signaling may also be the evolutionary cause\nof chameleons' color-changing ability (Stuart-Fox et al., 2008).\n4\nFor the purpose of our discussion, we are conflating socialapproval and audience-design hypotheses under the category of\nsocial strategy.\n5\nThis hypothesis relates to characterizations of alignment as\nan unmediated mechanism (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).\n\nLife is beautiful, but cinema is paradise A priori, it is not clear that movie conversations would exhibit convergence. Dialogs between movie characters are not truthful representations of real-life conversations. They often are \"too carefully polished,\ntoo rhythmically balanced, too self-consciously artful\" (Kozloff, 2000), due to practical and artistic constraints and scriptwriting practice (McKee,\n1999). For example, mundane phenomena such as\nstuttering and word repetitions are generally nonexistent on the big screen. Moreover, writers have\nmany goals to accomplish, including the need to advance the plot, reveal character, make jokes as funny\nas possible, and so on, all incurring a cognitive load.\nSo, the question arises: do scripted movie dialogs, in spite of this quasi-artificiality and the\naforementioned generation/engagement gap, exhibit\nthe real-life phenomenon of stylistic convergence?\nWhen imagining dialogs, do scriptwriters (nonconsciously6 ) adjust the respondent's replies to echo the\ninitiator's use of articles, prepositions, and other apparently minor aspects of lexical choice? According\nto our results, this is indeed the case, which has fascinating implications.\nFirst, this provides evidence that coordination, assumed to be driven by social motivations, has become so deeply embedded into our ideas of what\nconversations \"sound like\" that the phenomenon occurs even when the person generating the dialog is\nnot the recipient of the social benefits.7\nSecond, movies can be seen as a controlled environment in which preconceptions about the relation between communication patterns and the social features of the participants can be studied. This\ngives us the opportunity to understand how people\n(scriptwriters) nonconsciously expect convergence\nto relate to factors such as gender, status and relation type. Are female characters thought to accommodate more to male characters than vice-versa?\nFurthermore, movie scripts constitute a corpus\nthat is especially convenient because meta-features\n6\n\nThe phenomenon of real-life language convergence is not\nwidely known among screenplay authors (Beth F. Milles, professor of acting and directing, personal communication).\n7\nAlthough some writers may perhaps imagine themselves\n\"in the shoes\" of the recipients, recall that authors generally\ndon't include in their scripts the repetitions and ungrammaticalities of \"real-life\" speech.\n\n\flike gender can be more or less readily obtained.\nContributions We check for convergence in a\ncorpus of roughly 250,000 conversational exchanges\nfrom movie scripts (available at http://www.\ncs.cornell.edu/~cristian/movies).\nSpecifically, we examine the set of nine families of\nstylistic features previously utilized by Ireland et\nal. (2011), and find a statistically significant convergence effect for all these families. We thereby\nprovide evidence that language coordination is so\nimplanted within our conception of conversational\nbehavior that, even if such coordination is socially\nmotivated, it is exhibited even when the person\ngenerating the language in question is not receiving\nany of the presumed social advantages.\nWe also study the effects of gender, narrative importance, and hostility. Intriguingly, we find that\nthese factors indeed \"affect\" movie characters' linguistic behavior; since the characters aren't real,\nand control of stylistic lexical choice is largely nonconscious, the effects of these factors can only be\nspringing from patterns existing in the scriptwriters'\nminds.\nOur findings, by enhancing our understanding of\nlinguistic adaptation effects in stylistic word choice\nand its relation to various socially relevant factors,\nmay in the future aid in practical applications. Such\nan understanding would give us insight into how\nand what kinds of language coordination yield more\nsatisfying interactions - convergence has been already shown to enhance communication in organizational contexts (Bourhis, 1991), psychotherapy (Ferrara, 1991), care of the mentally disabled (Hamilton,\n1991), and police-community interactions (Giles et\nal., 2007). Moreover, a deeper understanding can aid\nhuman-computer interaction by informing the construction of natural-language generation systems,\nsince people are often more satisfied with encounters exhibiting appropriate linguistic convergence\n(Bradac et al., 1988; van Baaren et al., 2003), even\nwhen the other conversational participant is known\nto be a computer (Nass and Lee, 2000; Branigan et\nal., 2010).\n\n2\n\nRelated work not already mentioned\n\nLinguistic style and human characteristics Using stylistic (i.e., non-topical) elements like arti-\n\ncles and prepositions to characterize the utterer in\nsome way has a long history, including in authorship attribution (Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Juola,\n2008), personality-type classification (Argamon et\nal., 2005; Oberlander and Gill, 2006; Mairesse et al.,\n2007), gender categorization (Koppel et al., 2002;\nMukherjee and Liu, 2010; Herring and Paolillo,\n2006), identification of interactional style (Jurafsky\net al., 2009; Ranganath et al., 2009), and recognizing\ndeceptive language (Hancock et al., 2008; Mihalcea\nand Strapparava, 2009).\nImagined conversations There has been work in\nthe NLP community applying computational techniques to fiction, scripts, and other types of text\ncontaining imagined conversations. For example,\none recent project identifies conversational networks\nin novels, with the goal of evaluating various literary theories (Elson et al., 2010; Elson and McKeown, 2010). Movie scripts were used as word-sensedisambiguation evaluation data as part of an effort\nto generate computer animation from the scripts (Ye\nand Baldwin, 2006). Sonderegger (2010) employed\na corpus of English poetry to study the relationship between pronunciation and network structure.\nRayson et al. (2001) computed part-of-speech frequencies for imaginative writing in the British National Corpus, finding a typology gradient progressing from conversation to imaginative writing (e.g.,\nnovels) to task-oriented speech to informative writing. The data analyzed by Oberlander and Gill\n(2006) consisted of emails that participants were instructed to write by imagining that they were going\nto update a good friend on their current goings-on.\n\n3\n\nMovie dialogs corpus\n\nTo address the questions raised in the introduction, we created a large set of imagined conversations, starting from movie scripts crawled from\nvarious sites.8 Metadata for conversation analysis and duplicate-script detection involved mostlyautomatic matching of movie scripts with the IMDB\nmovie database; clean-up resulted in 617 unique titles tagged with genre, release year, cast lists, and\n8\n\nThe source of these scripts and more detail about the corpus\nare given in the README associated with the Cornell moviedialogs corpus, available at http://www.cs.cornell.\nedu/~cristian/movies .\n\n\fIMDB information. We then extracted 220,579\nconversational exchanges between pairs of characters engaging in at least 5 exchanges, and automatically matched these characters to IMDB to retrieve gender (as indicated by the designations \"actor\" or \"actress\") and/or billing-position information\nwhen possible (\u22489000 characters, \u22483000 genderidentified and \u22483000 billing-positioned). The latter\nfeature serves as a proxy for narrative importance:\nthe higher up in the credits, the more important the\ncharacter tends to be in the film.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\ndataset of (metadata-rich) imaginary conversations\nto date.\n\n4\n\nMeasuring linguistic style\n\nFor consistency with prior work, we employed the\nnine LIWC-derived categories (Pennebaker et al.,\n2007) deemed by Ireland et al. (2011) to be processed by humans in a generally non-conscious fashion. The nine categories are: articles, auxiliary\nverbs, conjunctions, high-frequency adverbs, impersonal pronouns, negations, personal pronouns,\nprepositions, and quantifiers (451 lexemes total).\nIt is important to note that language coordination\nis multimodal: it does not necessarily occur simultaneously for all features (Ferrara, 1991), and speakers\nmay converge on some features but diverge on others\n(Thakerar et al., 1982); for example, females have\nbeen found to converge on pause frequency with\nmale conversational partners but diverge on laughter (Bilous and Krauss, 1988).\n\n5\n\nFor example, we might be studying whether one\nperson A's inclusion of articles in an utterance triggers the usage of articles in respondent B's reply.\nNote that this differs from asking whether B uses articles more often when talking to A than when talking to other people (it is not so surprising that people speak differently to different audiences). This\nalso differs from asking whether B eventually starts\nmatching A's behavior in later utterances within the\nsame conversation. We specifically want to know\nwhether each utterance by A triggers an immediate\nchange in B's behavior, as such instantaneous adaptation is what we consider the most striking aspect\nof convergence, although immediate and long-term\ncoordination are clearly related.\nWe now describe the statistic we employ to measure the extent to which person B accommodates to\nA. Consider an arbitrary conversational exchange\nstarted by A, and let a denote A's initiating utterance\nand b,\u2192a denote B's reply to a.9 Note that we use\nlowercase to emphasize when we are talking about\nindividual utterances rather than all the utterances of\nthe particular person, and that thus, the arrow in b,\u2192a\nindicates that we mean the reply to the specific single utterance a. Let at be the indicator variable for a\nexhibiting t, and similarly for bt,\u2192a . Then, we define\nthe convergence ConvA,B (t) of B to A as:\nP (bt,\u2192a = 1|at = 1) \u2212 P (bt,\u2192a = 1).\n\nNote that this quantity can be negative (indicating\ndivergence). The overall degree Conv(t) to which t\nserves as a trigger is then defined as the expectation\nof ConvA,B (t) over all initiator-respondent pairs:\n\nMeasuring convergence\n\nNiederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002) use the correlation coefficient to measure accommodation with respect to linguistic style features. While correlation\nat first seems reasonable, it has some problematic aspects in our setting (we discuss these problems later)\nthat motivate us to employ an alternative measure.\nWe instead use a convergence measure introduced\nin Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.

Since our focus is different, we\ncontrol for different factors.\n\n\f0.80\n0.70\n\n6\n\nExperimental results\n\n6.1\n\nConvergence exists in fictional dialogs\n\nFor each ordered pair of characters (A, B) and for\neach feature family t, we estimate equation (1) in a\nstraightforward manner: the fraction of B's replies\nto t-manifesting A utterances that themselves exhibit t, minus the fraction of all replies of B to A\nthat exhibit t.13 Fig. 1 compares the average values\nof these two fractions (as a way of putting convergence values into context), showing positive differences for all of the considered families of features\n(statistically significant, paired t-test p < 0.001); this\ndemonstrates that movie characters do indeed converge to each other's linguistic style on all considered trigger families.14\n11\n\nOne could also speculate that it is easier for B to (unconsciously) pick up on the presence of t than on its absence.\n12\nThe covariance of two random variables is their correlation\ntimes the product of their standard deviations.\n13\nFor each t, we discarded pairs of characters where some\nrelevant count is < 10, e.g., where B had fewer than 10 replies\nmanifesting the trigger.\n14\nWe obtained the same qualitative results when measuring\nconvergence via the correlation coefficient, doing so for the sake\nof comparability with prior work (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker,\n2002; Taylor and Thomas, 2008).\n\n0.60\n0.50\n0.40\n0.30\n0.20\n\nArticle\nPreposition\n\nConjunction\n\nAdverb\nPers. pron.\n\nAux. verb\n\nQuantifier\n\n0.00\n\nIndef. pron.\n\n0.10\nNegation\n\ncapture an important asymmetry. The case where\nat = 1 but bt,\u2192a = 0 represents a true failure to accommodate; but the case where at = 0 but bt,\u2192a = 1\nshould not, at least not to the same degree. For example, a may be very short (e.g., \"What?\") and thus\nnot contain an article, but we don't assume that this\ncompletely disallows B from using articles in their\nreply. In other words, we are interested in whether\nthe presence of t acts as a trigger, not in whether\nb,\u2192a exhibits t if and only if a does, the latter being\nwhat correlation detects.11\nIt bears mentioning that since at and bt,\u2192a are\nbinary, a simple calculation shows that the covariance12 cov(at , bt,\u2192a ) = ConvA,B (t) * P (at = 1).\nBut, the two terms on the right hand side are\nnot independent: raising P (at = 1) could cause\nConvA,B (t) to decrease by affecting the first term\nin its definition, P (bt,\u2192a = 1|at = 1) (see eq. 1).\n\nFigure 1: Implicit depiction of convergence for each trigger family t, illustrated as the difference between the\nmeans of P (bt,\u2192a = 1|at = 1) (right/light-blue bars) and\nP (bt,\u2192a = 1) (left/dark-blue bars). (This implicit representation allows one to see the magnitude of the two components making up our definition of convergence.) The\ntrigger families are ordered by decreasing convergence.\nAll differences are statistically significant (paired t-test).\nIn all figures in this paper, error bars represent standard\nerror, estimated via bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).\n(Here, the error bars, in red, are very tight.)\n\nMovies vs. Twitter One can ask how our results\non movie dialogs correspond to those for real-life\nconversations. To study this, we utilize the results\nof Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2011) on a largescale collection of Twitter exchanges as data on\nreal conversational exchanges. Figure 2 depicts the\ncomparison, revealing two interesting effects. First,\nTwitter users coordinate more than movie characters\non all the trigger families we considered, which does\nshow that the convergence effect is stronger in actual\ninterchanges. On the other hand, from the perspective of potentially using imagined dialogs as proxies for real ones, it is intriguing to see that there is\ngenerally a correspondence between how much convergence occurs in real dialogs for a given feature\nfamily and how much convergence occurs for that\nfeature in imagined dialogs, although conjunctions\nand articles show a bit less convergence in fictional\n\n\f0.05\n\nTwitter\nMovies\n\nConvergence\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n\nNegation\nIndef. pron.\nQuantifier\nConjunction\nArticle\nAux. verb\nAdverb\nPers. pron.\nPreposition\n\n0.00\n\nFigure 2: Convergence in Twitter conversations (left bars)\nvs. convergence in movie dialogs (right bars; corresponds to the difference between the two respective bars\nin Fig. 1) for each trigger family.

Suppose that we have a conversation a1 b2 a3 b4 a5 . . .. The\nlefthand/dark-green bars show the usual convergence\nmeasure, which involves the utterance pair a1 and b2 . The\nrighthand/mustard-green bars show convergence based\non pairs like a1 and b4 - utterances in the same conversation, but not adjacent. We see that there is a much\nstronger triggering effect for immediately adjacent utterances.\n\nexchanges than this pattern would suggest.\n6.2\n\nPotential alternative explanations\n\nImmediate vs. within-conversation effects An\nadditional natural question is, how much are these\naccommodation effects due to an immediate triggering effect, as opposed to simply being a by-product\nof utterances occurring within the same conversation? For instance, could the results be due just to\nthe topic of the conversation?\nTo answer this question requires measuring \"convergence\" between utterances that are not adjacent,\nbut are still in the same conversation. To this end,\nwe first restricted attention to those conversations\nin which there were at least five utterances, so that\nthey would have the structure a1 b2 a3 b4 a5 .... We\nthen measure convergence not between adjacent utterances, like a1 and b2 , but where we skip an utterance, such as the pair a1 , b4 or b2 , a5 . This helps\ncontrol for topic effects, since b4 and a1 are still\nclose and thus fairly likely to be on the same subject.15\nFigure 3 shows that the level of convergence always falls off after the skipped utterance, sometimes\ndramatically so, thus demonstrating that the level\nof immediate adaptation effects we see cannot be\nsolely explained by the topic of conversation or other\nconversation-level effects. These results accord with\nthe findings of Levelt and Kelter (1982), where interposing \"interfering\" questions lowered the chance\nof a question's preposition being echoed by the respondent, and Reitter et al. (2006), where the effects\nof structural priming were shown to decay quickly\nwith the distance between the priming trigger and\nthe priming target.\nTowards the same end, we also performed randomization experiments in which we shuffled the order of each participant's utterances in each conversation, while maintaining alternation between speakers. We again observed drop-offs in this randomized\ncondition in comparison to immediate convergence,\nthe main focus of this paper.\nSelf-coordination Could our results be explained\nentirely by the author converging to their own\nself, given that self-alignment has been documented\n15\n\nIt is true that they might be on different topics, but in fact\neven b2 might be on a different subject from a1 .\n\n\f(Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Reitter et al., 2006)?\nIf that were the case, then the characters that the author is writing about should converge to themselves\nno more than they converge to different characters.\nBut we ran experiments showing that this is not the\ncase, thus invalidating this alternative hypothesis. In\nfact, characters converge to themselves much more\nthan they converge to other characters.\n6.3\n\nConvergence and imagined relation\n\nWe now analyze how convergence patterns vary with\nthe type of relationship between the (imagined) participants. Note that, given the multimodal character of convergence, treating each trigger family separately is the most appropriate way to proceed, since\nin past work, for the same experimental factor (e.g.,\ngender), different features converge differently (refer back to \u00a74). For clarity of exposition, we discuss\nin detail only the results for the Articles feature family; but the results for all trigger families are summarized in Fig. 7, discussed later.\nImagined gender Fig. 4(a) shows how convergence on article usage depends on the gender of the\ninitiator and respondent. Females are more influential than males: movie characters of either gender accommodate more to female characters than to\nmale characters (compare the Female initiator bar\nwith the Male initiator bar, statistically significant,\nindependent t-test, p < 0.05). Also, female characters seem to accommodate slightly more to other\ncharacters than male characters do (though not statistically significantly so in our data).\nWe also compare the amount of convergence between all the possible types of gendered initiatorrespondent pairs involved (Fig. 4(b)). One can observe, for example, that male characters adapt less in\nsame-gender situations (Male-Male conversations)\nthan in mixed-gender situations (Female initiatorMale respondent), while the opposite is true for female characters (Female-Female vs. Male-Female).\nInterpreting these results lies beyond the scope\nof this paper. We note that these results could be\na correlate of many factors, such as the roles that\nmale and female characters are typically assigned in\nmovie scripts.16\n16\n\nA comparison to previously reported results on real-life\ngender effects is not straightforward, since they pertain to differ-\n\nNarrative importance Does the relative importance bestowed by the scriptwriter to the characters\naffect the amount of linguistic coordination he or she\n(nonconsciously) embeds in their dialogs? Fig. 5\nshows that, on average, the lead character converges\nto the second-billed character more than vice-versa\n(compare left bar in 1st resp. group with left bar in\n2nd resp. group).\nOne possible confounding factor is that there is\nsignificant gender imbalance in the data (82% of all\nlead characters are males, versus only 51% of the\nsecondary characters). Could the observed difference be a direct consequence of the relation between\ngender and convergence discussed above? The answer is no: the same qualitative observation holds if\nwe restrict our analysis to same-gender pairs (compare the righthand bars in each group in Fig. 517 ).\nIt would be interesting to see whether these results could be brought to bear on previous results\nregarding the relationship between social status and\nconvergence, but such interpretation lies beyond the\nscope of this paper, since the connection between\nbilling order and social status is not straightforward.\nQuarreling The level of contention in conversations has also been shown to be related to the amount\nof convergence (Giles, 2008; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002; Taylor and Thomas, 2008). To test\nwhether this tendency holds in the case of imagined\nconversations, as a small pilot study, we manually\nclassified the conversations between 24 main pairs\nof characters from romantic comedies18 as: quarreling, some quarreling and no quarreling. Although\nthe experiment was too small in scale to provide\nstatistical significance, the results (Fig. 6) suggest\nthat indeed the level of convergence is affected by\nent features; Ireland and Pennebaker (2010) show that females\nmatch their linguistic style more than males, where style matching is averaged over the same 9 trigger families we employ (they\ndo not report gender effect for each family separately).\n17\nFigure 5 also shows that our convergence measure does\nachieve negative values in practice, indicating divergence. Divergence is a rather common phenomenon which deserves attention in future work; see Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.\n(2011) for an account.\n18\nWe chose the romantic comedy genre since it is often characterized by some level of contention between the two people\nin the main couple.\n\n\farticle\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n(a)\n\nF-F\n\nF init.\n\nAll\n\n0.00\n\nM resp.\n\n0.00\n\nF resp.\n\n0.01\nM init.\n\n0.01\n\nM-F\n\n0.02\n\nF-M\n\n0.02\n\nM-M\n\nConvergence\n\n0.04\n\nAll\n\nConvergence\n\narticle\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Relation between Article convergence and imagined gender.

Interestingly, the\nreverse is true for adverbs; there, we observe divergence for contentious conversations and convergence for non-contentious conversations (detailed\nplot omitted due to space constraints). This corresponds to Niederhoffer and Pennebaker's (2002) observations made on real conversations in their study\n\nof the Watergate transcripts: when the relationship\nbetween the two deteriorated, Richard Nixon converged more to John Dean on articles, but diverged\non other features.19\nResults for the other features Our results above\nsuggest some intriguing interplay between convergence and gender, status, and level of hostility in\nimagined dialogs, which may shed light on how\npeople (scriptwriters) nonconsciously expect con19\n\nAdverbs were not included in their study.\n\n\farticle\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\nConvergence\n\n0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n\nQuarrel\n\nSm. quarrel\n\n2nd resp.\n\n1st resp.\n\nAll\n\n0.01\n\nNo quarrel\n\n0.00\nRom. com.\n\nConvergence\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\narticle\n\n0.06\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of the convergence of first-billed\n(lead) characters to second-billed characters (left bar in\n1st resp. group) to that of second-billed characters to\nleads (left bar in 2nd resp. group); righthand bars (dark\ngreen) in each group show results for Male-Male pairs\nonly.\n\nFigure 6: Relation between contention and convergence.\nThe third bar combines quarreling and some quarreling\nto ameliorate data sparsity.
