Howerver, fully coherent laser beams are\nvery sensitive to fluctuations of the atmospheric refractive index. The initially coherent laser beam acquires some properties of Gaussian statistics in\ncourse of its propagation through the turbulence. As a result, the noise/signal\nratio approaches unity for long-distance propagation. (See, for example,\nRefs.[1]-[6]). This unfavourable effect limits the performance of communication channels. To mitigate this negative effect the use of partially (spatially)\ncoherent beams was proposed. The coherent laser beam can be transformed\ninto a partially coherent beam by means of a phase diffuser placed near the\nexit aperture. This diffuser introduces an additional phase (randomly varying in space and time) to the wave front of the outgoing radiation. Statistical\ncharacteristics of the random phase determine the initial transverse coherence length of the beam. It is shown in Refs. [7],[8] that a considerable\ndecrease in the noise/signal ratio can occur under following conditions: (i)\nthe ratio of the initial transverse coherence length, \u03bbc , to the beam radius,\nr0 , should be essentially smaller than unity; and (ii) the characteristic time\nof phase variations, \u03c4d , should be much smaller than the integration time, T ,\nof the detector. However, only limiting cases (\u03c4d /T ) \u2192 0 and (\u03c4d /T ) \u2192 \u221e\nhave been considered in the literature. (See, for example, Refs. [7],[8] and\nRef. [9], respectively). It is evident that the inequality \u03c4d << T can be\neasily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time. At\nthe same time, this kind of the detector cannot distinguish different signals\nwithin the interval T . This means that the resolution of the receiving system\nmight become too low for the case of large T . On the other hand, there is a\ntechnical restriction on phase diffusers: up to now their characteristic times,\n\u03c4d , are not smaller than 10\u22127 s. Besides that, in some specific cases (see, for\nexample, Ref. [10]), the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the\nphase diffuser (\u2206\u03c9 \u223c \u03c4d\u22121 ) may become unacceptably high.\nThe factors mentioned above impose serious restrictions on the physical\ncharacteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations. An adequate choice of diffusers may be\nfacilitated if we know in detail the effect of finite-time phase variation, introduced by them, on the photon statistics. In this case, it is possible to\ncontrol the performance of communication systems. In what follows, we will\nobtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on \u03c4d /T without\nany restrictions on the value of this ratio. This is the main purpose of our\npaper. Further analysis is based on the formalism developed in Ref. [8] and\nmodified here to understand the case of finite-time dynamics of the phase\n2\n\n\fdiffuser.\n\n2\n\nThe method of photon distribution function in the problem of scintillations.\n\nThe detectors of the absorbed type do not sense the instantaneous intensity\nof electromagnetic waves I(t). They sense the intensity averaged over some\nfinite interval T i.e.\nZ\n1 t+T /2 \u2032 \u2032\n \u0304\nI(t) =\nI(t )dt .\n(1)\nT t\u2212T /2\nUsually, the averaging time T (the integration time of the detector) is much\nsmaller than the characteristic time of the turbulence variation, \u03c4A , (T <<\n\u03c4A \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22123 s). Therefore, the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averaging of Eq. 1 over many measurements corresponding\nvarious realizations of the refractive-index configurations.\nThe scintillation index determining the mean-square fluctuations of the\nintensity is defined by\n\u0015\u001e\n \u0304 2\n1 Z t+T /2 Z t+T /2 \u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n \u0304 2 = h : I(t) : i \u22121,\n \u0304 2 hIi\ndt\ndt\nh\n:\nI(t\n)I(t\n)\n:\ni\u2212h\nIi\n \u03042\nT 2 t\u2212T /2 t\u2212T /2\nhIi\n(2)\nwhere the symbol {: ... :} indicates the normal ordering of the creation and\nannihilation operators which determine the intensity, I(t). (See more details\nin Refs. [8],[11]). The brackets < ... > indicate quantum-mechanical and\natmospheric averagings.\nThe intensity I depends not only on t, but also on the spatial variable\nr. Therefore, the detected intensity is the intensity I(r, t) averaged not only\nover t as in Eq. 1, but also over the detector aperture. For simplicity, we will\nrestrict ourselves to calculations of the intensity correlations for coinciding\nspatial points that correspond to \"small\" detector aperture. This simplification is quite reasonable for a long-distance propagation path of the beam.\nIn the case of quasimonochromatic light, we can choose I(r, t) in the form\n\n\u03c32 =\n\n\u0014\n\nI(r, t) =\n\n1 X \u2212ikr +\ne\nbq+k/2 (t)bq\u2212k/2 (t),\nV q,k\n\n(3)\n\nwhere b+\nq (t) and bq (t) are the creation and annihilation operators of photons\n3\n\n\fwith momentum h\u0304q. They are given in the Heisenberg representation. V =\nLx Ly Lz is the volume of the system.\nIt follows from Eqs. 2,3 that \u03c3 2 can be obtained if one knows the average\nh : I(r, t)I(r, t\u2032) : i =\n\n1\nV2\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nq,k,q\u2032 ,k\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(t)b+\ne\u2212i(k+k )r hb+\n\u2032 (t )b \u2032 k\u2032 (t )bq\u2212 k (t)i.\nq\u2212\nq+ k\nq\u2032 + k\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4)\nIt is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strengths\nand propagation distances. Nevertheless, the following qualitative reasoning\ncan help to do this in the case of strong turbulence. We have mentioned that\nthe laser light acquires the properties of Gaussian statistics in the course of\nits propagation through the turbulent atmosphere. As a result, in the limit\nof infinitely long propagation path, z, only \"diagonal\" terms, i.e. terms with\n(i) k = k\u2032 = 0 or (ii) q + k/2 = q\u2032 \u2212 k\u2032 /2, q \u2212 k/2 = q\u2032 + k\u2032 /2 contribute to\nthe right part of Eq. 4. For large but still finite z, there exist small ranges\nof k, k\u2032 6= 0 in case (i) and q + k/2 6= q\u2032 \u2212 k\u2032 /2, q \u2212 k/2 6= q\u2032 + k\u2032 /2 in\ncase (ii) contributing into the sum in Eq. 4. The presence of the mentioned\nregions is due to the two possible ways of correlating of four different waves\n(see Ref. [12]) which enter the right hand side of Eq. 4. As explained in Ref.\n[13], the characteristic sizes of regions (i) and (ii) depend on the atmospheric\nbroadening of beam radii as (\u2206Rb )\u22121 , thus decreasing with increasing z.\nIn the case of long-distance propagation, (\u2206R)\u22121\nis much smaller than the\nb\ncomponent of photon wave-vectors perpendicular to the z axis. The last\nquantity grows with z as z 1/2 . (See Ref. [8]). For this reason, the overlapping\nof regions (i) and (ii) can be neglected. In this case Eq. 4 can be rewritten\nin the convenient form:\nX\nX\n1\nh : I(r, t)I(r, t\u2032) : i = 2\n(t)bq\u2212 k (t) \u00d7\n(5)\nh : e\u2212ikr b+\nq+ k\n2\n2\nV |k|,|k|\u2032<k0 q,q\u2032\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212ikr +\ne\u2212ik r b+\nbq+ k (t)bq\u2212 k (t\u2032 )e\u2212ik r b+\n\u2032 (t )b \u2032 k\u2032 (t) : i,\n\u2032 (t )b \u2032 k\u2032 (t ) + e\nq\u2212\nq\u2212\nq\u2032 + k\nq\u2032 + k\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere the value k0 , confining summation over k, k , is chosen to be greater\nthan Rb\u22121 but much smaller than the characteristic transverse wave vector of\nthe photons; this is consistent with the above explanations. The two terms in\nthe right-hand side correspond to the two regions of four-wave correlations.\nThe quantity\nf (r, q, t) =\n\n1 X \u2212ikr +\ne\nbq+ k (t)bq\u2212 k (t)\n2\n2\nV |k|<k0\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fentering the right side of Eq. 5 is the operator of photon density in phase\nspace (the photon distribution function in r, q space). It was used in Refs.\n[8],[13] and [14] for the description of photon propagation in turbulent atmospheres. By analogy, we can define the two-time distribution function\nf (r, q, t, t\u2032 ) =\n\n1 X \u2212ikr +\ne\nbq+ k (t)bq\u2212 k (t\u2032 ).\n2\n2\nV |k|<k0\n\n(7)\n\nThen Eq. 5 can be rewritten in terms of the distribution functions as\nh : I(r, t)I(r, t\u2032) : i =\n\nX\n\nq,q\u2032\n\nh : f (r, q, t)f (r, q\u2032, t\u2032 ) + f (r, q, t, t\u2032 )f (r, q\u2032, t\u2032 , t) : i\n\n(8)\nLet us represent f (r, q, t, t\u2032) in the form f (r, q, t, t + \u03c4 ). We assume that\n\u03c4 \u2264 T \u226a \u03c4A , as explained in the text after Eq.1. In this case the Hamiltonian\nof photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered to be independent\nof time. As a result, both functions defined by Eqs. 6 and 7 satisfy the same\nkinetic equation, i.e.\n(\u2202t + cq \u2202r + F\u2202q )f (r, q, t) = 0\n(\u2202t + cq \u2202r + F\u2202q )f (r, q, t, t + \u03c4 ) = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere cq = \u2202\u03c9q /\u2202q is the photon velocity, F is a random force, caused by\nthe turbulence. This force is equal to \u03c90 \u2202n(r)/\u2202r, where \u03c90 is the frequency\nof laser radiation. n(r) is the refractive index of the atmosphere.

The\nfunction \u03a6 describes the profile of the laser mode, which is assumed to be\n2\n2\nGaussian-type function [\u03a6 = ( \u03c02 )1/2 r0\u22121 e\u2212r\u22a5 /r0 ]. r0 desribes the initial radius\nof the beam.\nTo account for the effect of the phase diffuser, a factor ei\u03c6(r\u22a5 ,t0 ) or ei\u03c6(r\u22a5 ,t0 +\u03c4 )\nshould be inserted into the integrand of Eq. 14. The quantity \u03c6(r\u22a5 , t) is the\nrandom phase introduced by the phase diffuser.

There\nare integrations over variables r, r\u2032 , r1 , r\u20321 as shown in Eq. 14. Furthermore,\nthe brackets < ... >, which indicate averaging over different realizations of\nthe atmosperic inhomogeneities, also indicate averaging over different states\nof the phase diffuser. As long as both types of averaging do not correlate,\nthe factor (15) entering Eq. 13 must be averaged over different instants, t0 .\nTo begin with, let us consider the simplest case of two phase correlations\n\u2032\n\nhei[\u03c6(r,t0 )\u2212\u03c6(r ,t0 )] i.\n\n(16)\n\nIt is evident that in the case h|\u03c6|i >> 1, as shown schematically in Fig. 1,\nthe factor (16) is sizable if only points r and r\u2032 are close to one another.\nTherefore, the term given by Eq. 16 can be replaced by\nhei\n\n\u2202\u03c6(r,t0 )\n(r\u2212r\u2032 )\n\u2202r\n\n\u22122\n\ni = e\u2212\u03bbc\n\n(r\u2212r\u2032 )2\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\n0)\nwhere \u2202\u03c6(r,t\nis considered to be a Gaussian random variable with the mean\u2202r\n0) 2\n0) 2\n] i = h[ \u2202\u03c6(r,t\n] i = 2\u03bb\u22122\nsquare values given by h[ \u2202\u03c6(r,t\nc , where \u03bbc is the\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\ncorrelation length of phase fluctuations. (See Fig.1). As we see, in this\ncase the effect of phase fluctuations can be described by the Schell model\n[7]-[9],[15]-[17].\nA somewhat more complex situation is for the average value of \u03a5 given\nby Eq. 15. There is an effective phase correlation not only in the case of\n\n7\n\n\fcoincident times, but also for differing times. For \u03bbc << r0 , two different\nsets of coordinates contribute considerably to phase correlations. This can\nbe described mathematically as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u03a5i = hei[\u03c6(r,t0 )\u2212\u03c6(r ,t0 )+\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )\u2212\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )] i \u2248 hei[\u03c6(r,t0 )\u2212\u03c6(r ,t0 )] i \u00d7\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(18)\n\n\u2032\n\nhei[\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )\u2212\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )] i + hei[\u03c6(r,t0 )\u2212\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )] ihei[\u03c6(r1 ,t0 +\u03c4 )\u2212\u03c6(r ,t0 )] i.\n\nRepeating the arguments leading to Eq. 17, we represent the difference in\nthe last term \u03c6(r, t0 ) \u2212 \u03c6(r\u20321 , t0 + \u03c4 ) as\n\u2202\u03c6(r, t0 )\n\u2202\u03c6(r, t0 )\n\u03c4.\n(r \u2212 r\u20321 ) \u2212\n\u2202r\n\u2202t0\n\n(19)\n\nThen, considering the random functions \u2202\u03c6(r,t)\nand \u2202\u03c6(r,t)\nas independent\n\u2202r\n\u2202t\nGaussian variables, we obtain a simple expression for h\u03a5i. It is given by\n\u22122\n\nh\u03a5i = e\u2212\u03bbc\n\n[(r\u2212r\u2032 )2 +(r1 \u2212r\u2032 1 )2 ]\n\n\u22122\n\n+ e\u2212\u03bbc\n\n[(r\u2212r\u2032 1 )2 +(r\u2032 \u2212r1 )2 ]\u22122\u03bd 2 \u03c4 2\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\n]2 i = 2\u03bd 2 .\nwhere h[ \u2202\u03c6(r,t)\n\u2202t\nAs we see, the effect of the phase screen can be described by two parameters, \u03bbc and \u03bd, which characterize the spatial and temporal coherence of the\nlaser beam. In the limiting case, \u03bd \u2192 \u221e, the second term in Eq. 20 vanishes\nand the problem is reduced to the case considered in Refs. [7],[8]. In the\nopposite case, \u03bd \u2192 0, both terms in Eq. 20 are important. This is shown\nin Ref. [9]. In what follows, we will see that these two limiting cases have\nphysical interpretations where where \u03bdT >> 1 (slow detector) and \u03bdT << 1\n(fast detector), respectively.\nThere is a specific realization of the diffuser in which a random phase\ndistribution moves across the beam. (This situation can be modeled by a\nrotating transparent disk with large diameter and varying thickness.) The\nphase depends here on the only variable r \u2212 vt, i.e.\n\u03c6(r, t) \u2261 \u03c6(r \u2212 vt),\n\n(21)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the drift. Then we have\n\u22122\n\nh\u03a5i \u2248 e\u2212\u03bbc\n\n[(r\u2212r\u2032 )2 +(r1 \u2212r\u2032 1 )2 ]\n\n\u22122\n\n+ e\u2212\u03bbc\n\n[(r\u2212r\u20321 +v\u03c4 )2 +(r\u2032 \u2212r1 +v\u03c4 )2 ]\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nComparing Eqs. 20 and 22, we see that the quantity, v/\u03bbc , stands for the\ncharacteristic parameter describing the efficiency of the phase diffuser. The\n8\n\n\fcriterion of \"slow\" detector requires (vT /\u03bbc ) >> 1. Qualitatively, the two\nscenarios of phase variations, given by Eqs. 20 and 22, affect in a similar way\nthe intensity fluctuations. In what follows, we consider the first of them as\nthe simplest one. (This is because the spatial and temporal variables in h\u03a5i,\ngiven by Eq. 20, are separable.)\n\n2.5\n\nslow detector\nC\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n1\n\n-13\n\n=10\n\n/r\n\n2\n0\n\nm\n\n-2/3\n\n=1\n\n2\n\nr\n\n2\nn\n\n1.0\n\nr\n0.5\n\nr\n\n2\n1\n\n/r\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n/r\n\n2\n0\n\n=0.2\n\n=0.05\n\n0.0\n1\n\n10\n\nz(km)\n\nFigure 2: The scintillation index \u03c3 2 vs propagation distance z in the case of\n\"slow\" detector: \u03bdT \u2192 \u221e.

Fig. 2 illustrates\nthe effect of the phase diffuser on scintillations in the limit of a \"slow\" detector (\u03bdT \u2192 \u221e). We can see a considerable decrease in \u03c3 2 caused by the\nphase diffuser. At the same time, the effect of the phase screen on \u03c3 2 becomes\nweaker for finite values of \u03bdT . Moreover, comparing the two upper curves in\nFig. 3, we see the opposite effect: slow phase variations (\u03bdT = 1) result in\nincreased scintillations. There is a simple explanation for this phenomenon:\nthe noise generated by the turbulence is complemented by the noise arising\nfrom the random phase screen. The integration time of the detector, T , is\nnot sufficiently large for averaging phase variations generated by the diffuser.\nThe\nfunction, \u03a8(\u03bdT ), has a very simple form in the two limits: (i)\u03a8(\u03bdT ) \u2248\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n, when \u03bdT >> 1 ; and (ii) \u03a8(\u03bdT ) \u2248 2, when \u03bdT << 1. Then, in case\n1 + \u221a2\u03bdT\n(i) and for small values of the initial coherence [(r12 /r02 ) << 1], the asymptotic\nterm for the scintillation index (z \u2192 \u221e) is given by\n\u221a\nr12\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c3 \u2248 2+\u221a\n.\n(24)\nr0\n2\u03bdT\nKt0 = qt0 \u2212 q\u2032t0 +\n\nThe right-hand\nside of Eq. 24 differs from analogous one in Ref. [8] by the\n\u221a\n\u03c0\nvalue \u221a2\u03bdT that is much less than unity but, nevertheless, can be comparable\nor even greater than (r1 /r0 )2 .\nIn case (ii), the asymptotic value of \u03c3 2 is close to unity, coinciding with\nthe results of Refs. [6] and [9]. This agrees with well known behavior of the\nscintillation index to approach unity for any source distribution, provided\nthe response time of the recording instrument is short compared with the\nsource coherence time. (See, for example, survey [4]).\n10\n\n\fA similar tendency can be seen in both Figs. 3 and 4: the curves with the\nsmallest \u03bdT , used for numerical calculations (\u03bdT = 1), are close to the curves\n\"without diffuser\" in spite of the small initial coherence length [(r1 /r0 )2 =\n0.2; 0.05].

Other curves are for (r1 /r0 )2 =\n0.2.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt follows from our analysis that the scintillation index is very sensitive to\nthe diffuser parameters, \u03bbc and \u03bd, for long propagation paths. On the other\nhand, the characteristics of the irradience such as beam radius, R, and angleof-arrival spread, \u2206\u03b8, do not depend on the presence of the phase diffuser for\nlarge values of z. To see this, the following analysis is useful.\n\n11\n\n\f2.5\n\nC\n\n2\n\nn\n\n-13\n\n=10\n\nm\n\n-2/3\n\nr1=r0\n\n2.0\n\nT=1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\nT=5\nT=20\n\n0.5\n\n\"slow\" detector\n0.0\n1\n\n10\n\nz(km)\n\nFigure 4: The same as in Fig. 3 but for smaller initial coherence length:\n(r1 /r0 )2 = 0.05.\nThe beam radius expressed in terms of the distribution function is given\nby\nP R\n\nq\nR (z) = P R\n2\n\nq\n\n2\ndr\u22a5 r\u22a5\nhf (r, z, q, t)i\n.\ndr\u22a5 hf (r\u22a5 , z, q, t)i\n\n(25)\n\nStraightforward calculations using Eq. 10 with \u03c4 = 0 (see Ref. [8]) result in\nthe following explicit form:\nR2 (z) =\n\nr02\n2z 2\n+ 2 2 + 4T z 3 ,\n2\nq0 r1\n\n\u22121/3\n\n(26)\n\nwhere T = 0.558Cn2l0\nand l0 is the inner radius of turbulent eddies, which\nin our previous calculations was assumed to be equal 2\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22123 m. As we see,\nthe third term does not depend on the diffuser parameters and it dominates\nwhen z \u2192 \u221e.\nA similar situation holds for the angle-of-arrival spread, \u2206\u03b8. (This physical quantity is of great importance for the performance of communication\nsystems based on frequency encoded information [10].) It is defined by the\n12\n\n\fdistribution function as\n2\n\n(\u2206\u03b8(r\u22a5 , z)) =\n\nP\n\nq02\n\n2\nq q\u22a5 hf (r\u22a5 , z, q, t)i\n\nP\n\nq\n\nhf (r\u22a5 , z, q, t)i\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nSimple calculations, which are very similar to those while obtaining R2 , result\nin\n2\n4z 2\n[\u2206\u03b8(r\u22a5 = 0, z)]2 = 2 2 + 12T z \u2212 4 2 (r1\u22122 + 3T q02 z)2 .\n(28)\nr1 q0\nq0 R\nFor long propagation paths, Eq. 28 reduces to 3T z, which like R2 does not\ndepend on the diffuser parameters.\nAs we see, for large distances z, the quantities R2 and \u2206\u03b8 do not depend\non \u03bbc and \u03bd. This contrasts with the case of the scintillation index. So\npronounced differences can be explained by differences in the physical nature of these characteristics. It follows from Eq. 2 that the functional, \u03c3 2 ,\nis quadratic in the distribution function, f . Hence, four-wave correlations\ndetermine the value of scintillation index. The main effect of a phase diffuser on \u03c3 2 is to destroy correlations between waves exited at different times.\n(See more explanations in Ref. [14]). This is achieved at sufficiently small\nparameters \u03bbc and \u03bd \u22121 .\nIn contrast, R2 and \u2206\u03b8 depend on two wave-correlations, both waves\nbeing given at the same instant. Therefore, the values of R2 and \u2206\u03b8 do\nnot depend on the rate of phase variations [\u03bd does not enter the factor (17)\ndescribing the effect of phase diffuser]. Moreover, these quantities become\nindependent of \u03bbc at long propagation paths because light scattering on atmospheric inhomogeneities prevails in this case.\nThe plots in Figs. 3 anf 4 show that the finite-time effect is quite sizable\neven for very \"slow\" detectors (\u03bdT = 20). Our paper makes it possible to\nestimate the actual utility of phase diffusers in several physical regimes.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have analyzed the effects of a diffuser on scintillations for the case of\nlarge-amplitude phase fluctuations. This specific case is very convenient for\ntheoretial analysis because only two parameters are required to describe the\neffects of the diffuser. Phase fluctuations may occur independently in space as\nwell as in time. Also, our formalism can be applied for the physical situation\nin which a spatially random phase distribution drifts across the beam. (See\n13\n\n\fEq. 22.) Our results show the importance of both parameters, \u03bbc and \u03bd, on\nthe ability of a phase diffuser to suppress scintillations.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work was carried out under the auspices of the National Nuclear Security\nAdministration of the U.S. Department of Energy at Los Alamos National\nLaboratory under Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25396.
