Noting that the sign of the complex argument in\nequation (1) corresponds to the upper sign convention\nin equations (2) through (4) of Hamaker & Bregman\n(1996), the Stokes parameters are defined by\n\nwhere S0 is the total intensity, S = (S1 , S2 , S3 ) is the\nStokes polarisation vector, \u03c3 0 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix, and \u03c3 = (\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 , \u03c3 3 ) is a three-vector with components equal to the Pauli matrices. The four Hermitian basis matrices, consisting of the identity matrix\nand the three Pauli matrices, are defined as\n\u03c30 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c32 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c31 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c33 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\ni\n\n\u2212i\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Stokes parameters are the projections of the coherency matrix onto the basis matrices, given by\nSk = tr(\u03c3 k \u03c1),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere tr() is the matrix trace operator.\nLinear transformations of the electric field are represented by complex 2 \u00d7 2 Jones matrices. Under the\noperation, e\u2032 = Je, the coherency matrix is subjected\nto a congruence transformation, \u03c1\u2032 = J\u03c1J\u2020 . Using the\naxis-angle parameterisation (Britton 2000), the polar\ndecomposition of a Jones matrix (Hamaker 2000) is\nexpressed as\nJ = J Bm\u0302 (\u03b2) Rn\u0302 (\u03c6),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere J = |J|1/2 , |J| is the determinant of J, Bm\u0302 (\u03b2)\nis positive-definite Hermitian, and Rn\u0302 (\u03c6) is unitary;\nboth Bm\u0302 (\u03b2) and Rn\u0302 (\u03c6) are unimodular. Under the\ncongruence transformation of the coherency matrix,\nthe Hermitian matrix\nBm\u0302 (\u03b2) = \u03c3 0 cosh \u03b2 + m\u0302 * \u03c3 sinh \u03b2\n\n(7)\n\neffects a Lorentz boost of the Stokes four-vector along\nthe m\u0302 axis by a hyperbolic angle 2\u03b2.

As the orthogonal transformation of a\nvector in Euclidean space preserves its length, the polarimetric rotation leaves the total intensity and degree\nof polarisation unchanged.\n\n2.1\n.\n\nHere, the angular brackets denote an ensemble average, \u2297 is the matrix direct product, and e\u2020 is the Hermitian transpose of e.

The position angle\nof the linearly polarised component is also measured in\na counter-clockwise direction from North toward East.\n\n2.2\n\nThe PSR/IEEE Convention\n\nIn the majority of published pulsar polarisation observations, Stokes V is positive for LCP as defined\nby the IEEE (e.g. Manchester 1971; Stinebring et al.\n1984; Xilouris et al. 1998). This is the convention described by Kraus (1966); it is encoded in the sign of the\nphase in equation (1), the definition of the Pauli matrices in equation (4), and the relationships between the\nStokes parameters and the coherency matrix defined\nby equations (3) and (5). Using either equation (2) or\nequation (3) with S = (Q, U, V ), it can be shown that\nin the linear basis,\n1\n\u03c1=\n2\nIn this case,\n\n\u0012\n\nI +Q\nU + iV\n\nU \u2212 iV\nI\u2212Q\n\nU + iV = 2hey e\u2217x i.\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nThat is, Stokes V is positive when the phase of ey\nleads that of ex , which is opposite to the IAU convention for Stokes V . The PSR/IEEE convention is\nadopted and used in the remainder of this paper; it is\nthe standard implemented by the psrchive software\nand expressed in the psrfits definition.\n\n\f3\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nFigure 1: A right-hand circularly polarised (RCP) wave in the adopted coordinate system. The x and y\naxes lie in the plane of the sky, with the x-axis pointing North, the y-axis pointing East, and the z-axis\npointing toward the observer. The electric field vector e lies in the x\u2013y plane; its position angle \u03a8 is\nmeasured with respect to North, increasing toward East. As the RCP wave propagates in the positive z\ndirection, the position angle increases; that is, the electric field vector rotates counter-clockwise, as seen\nby the observer. Note that an RCP wave, as defined by the IEEE, forms a left-handed helix in space.\nThe PSR/IEEE convention for the position angle of the linear polarisation is consistent with the\nIAU/IEEE convention. However, as discussed in detail by Everett & Weisberg (2001), the rotating vector\nmodel (RVM; Radhakrishnan & Cooke 1969) has often been applied to measurements using an equation\nin which the position angle is assumed to increase in a\nclockwise direction on the sky, which is opposite to the\nIAU/IEEE convention. Therefore, care must be taken\nwhen comparing RVM parameter estimates from different experiments.\nGiven the definition of the Stokes parameters in\nterms of linearly polarised receptors, it is possible to\nalso define a standard basis for circularly polarised\nfeeds. The basis transformation, C, is chosen to effect\na convenient cyclic permutation of the Stokes parameters; that is, under the congruence transformation,\n\u03c1\u2032 = C\u03c1C\u2020 , the Stokes vector, S \u2032 = (V, Q, U ).\nThe transformation with unit determinant that effects the desired cyclic permutation of the Stokes parameters is\n1\nC= \u221a\n2i\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\n\u2212i\ni\n\n\u0013\n\n= (eL eR )\u2020 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\n1\neL = \u221a\n2i\n\n\u0012\n\n1\ni\n\n\u0013\n\nand\n\n1\neR = \u221a\n2i\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212i\n\n\u0013\n\nare the Jones vectors of left and right circularly polarised receptors expressed in the linear basis. Apart\nfrom an absolute phase factor of e\u2212i\u03c0/4 chosen to yield\na basis transformation with unit determinant, the above\ndefinition of circularly polarised receptors is identical\nto that of Hamaker & Bregman (1996).\n\n3\n\nInstrumental Conventions\n\nA wide variety of different conventions, both explicit\ndefinitions and implicit assumptions, are encountered\nin the design of observatory instrumentation and data\nanalysis software. Therefore, it is desirable to define a\nset of parameters that describe any known differences\nbetween the experimental design and the chosen standard. These corrections can be be broadly classified\ninto four groups: projection, basis, instrument, and\nbackend.\nThe known projection of the ideal feed receptors\nonto the plane of the sky may include effects such as\nthe parallactic rotation of an altitude-azimuth mounted\nantenna, or the foreshortening of fixed dipoles in an array. The ideal basis describes a feed consisting of two\northogonally polarised receptors with unit gain. The\nfeed may also be equipped with an internal reference\nsource, such as a noise diode, that may be used to\ncalibrate the differential gain and phase of the instrumentation. The instrument parameterises the transformation from the receptors to the backend, as determined using a separate calibration procedure (e.g.\nvan Straten 2004). The backend includes all hardware and software involved in reducing the astronomical data to produce results that are suitable for further\nanalysis. Only the basis and backend correction parameterisations are discussed here.\n\n3.1\n\nBasis Parameters\n\nIn principle, the polarisations of both an ideal feed\nand the reference source could be specified by four\nrotations; e.g. two sets of ellipticity and orientation\nangles (Chandrasekhar 1960). However, basis rotations can be problematic due to singularities at the\npoles. Furthermore, it may be preferable to use less\nabstract, more commonly encountered, and/or more\n\n\f4\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nreadily measured quantities. The convention may also\nbe simplified by assuming that the receptors are either\nlinearly or circularly polarised, and that the reference\nsource is linearly polarised. Under these assumptions,\nthe following four parameters are sufficient to completely describe the receiver.\n\nThe following two parameters are used to describe the\nbackend.\n\nFeed Basis: circularly or linearly polarised receptors\nFeed Hand: left or right; if left, e0 and e1 are switched\nSymmetry Angle: orientation of a linearly polarised\nsignal that produces an equal and in-phase response in\neach receptor\n\nBackend Phase: positive or negative\nDown Conversion: true or false; if true, the conjugation due to lower sideband down conversion has\nbeen corrected\nThe correction of complex conjugation is performed\nwhen either of the following conditions is exclusively\ntrue:\nA) backend phase is negative, or\nB) down conversion is false and lower sideband down\nconversion was used.\n\nCalibrator Phase: differential phase of the internal\nreference source, \u03a6c = tan\u22121 (S3 /S2 )\nIn the linear basis, a linearly polarised wave oscillating in the Northeast-to-Southwest plane (positive\nStokes U ) will produce equal and in-phase responses\nin each receptor; therefore, the symmetry angle has a\nnominal value of 45 degrees. Also, because the reference source is linearly polarised (S3 = V = 0), there\nare only two possible values for the calibrator phase: 0\n(U > 0) and 180 (U < 0) degrees.\nIn the circular basis, a linearly polarised wave oscillating in the North-to-South plane (positive Stokes\nQ) will produce equal and in-phase responses in each\nreceptor; therefore, the symmetry angle has a nominal\nvalue of 0 degrees. Also, because S2 = Q and S3 = U ,\nthe calibrator phase is arbitrary.\nGiven these parameters, the Jones matrix of the\nfeed is given by\nJ = XCRv\u0302 (\u0398),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere X is the identity in a right-handed system and\nthe exchange matrix in a left-handed system, C is the\nidentity in the linear basis and given by equation (15)\nin the circular basis, and \u0398 is equal to the symmetry\nangle less its nominal value (45 degrees in the linear\nbasis and 0 degrees in the circular basis). Note that,\nas defined by equation (8), Rv\u0302 (\u0398) effects a rotation of\nthe Stokes polarisation vector about the Stokes V axis\nby an angle 2\u0398. The coherency matrix of the internal\nreference source is\n\u03c1c =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nexp(i\u03a6c )\n\nexp(\u2212i\u03a6c )\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03a6c is the calibrator phase.\n\n3.2\n\nBackend parameters\n\nTo describe the design of the backend, it is sufficient to\nconsider only the complex conjugation of the electric\nfield. This occurs during lower sideband down conversion and/or when the design of an instrument is\nbased upon a different convention for the sign of the\nphase than that adopted in equation (1). In the case of\ndual-sideband down conversion, complex conjugation\noccurs when the phase of the quadrature component\nleads that of the in-phase component of the signal.\nComplex conjugation causes a sign change in S3 , a reflection that cannot be represented by a Jones matrix.\n\nThe correction is not performed when both A and B\nare true because they negate each other.\n\n3.3\n\nImplementation\n\nEach of the parameters described in the preceding sections has a corresponding parameter in the psrfits\ndefinition and a representation in the psrchive software. Table 1 summarises these parameters, the range\nof acceptable values for each parameter, and the effects\nthat they have on calibrated data.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn general, it is non-trivial to determine the instrumental convention parameters from first principles and\nan empirical approach must be adopted. This typically requires observations of either artificial sources\nwith known polarisation or astronomical sources that\nhave been previously well calibrated, such as the average polarisation profiles of PSR J0304+1932 and PSR\nJ0742\u22122822 presented in Figure 2. These sources are\nvisible to observatories in both Northern and Southern\nhemispheres; they also have relatively high flux densities, well-defined position angle variation, and sufficient circular polarisation for the purposes of comparison with other observations.\nThese data were recorded at the Parkes Observatory on 2009 October 9 and 10 using the 64 m antenna\nand two of the Parkes Digital Filter Banks (PDFB3\nand PDFB4). For each pulsar, a 256 MHz band centred at 1369 MHz was observed using the centre beam\nof the 20 cm Multibeam receiver and two bands, one\nwith 64 MHz of bandwidth centred at 732 MHz and\none with 1024 MHz of bandwidth centred at 3.1 GHz,\nwere observed using the 10-50 cm dual-band receiver.\nPrior to each pulsar observation, a noise diode coupled\nto the receptors was observed and used to calibrate\nthe differential gain and phase of the instrument. For\nthe 20 cm observations, the receptor cross-coupling parameters were calibrated as described in van Straten\n(2004). Absolute flux calibration was performed using\nobservations of the noise diode recorded while pointing on and off the bright Fanaroff-Riley type I radio\ngalaxy, 3C 218 (Hydra A), which was assumed to have\na flux density of 43.1 Jy at 1400 MHz and a spectral\nindex of 0.91.\n\n\fwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\n5\n\nFigure 2: Average polarisation profiles of PSR J0304+1932 (left) and PSR J0742\u22122822 (right), observed\nat radio wavelengths of approximately 40 cm (top), 20 cm (middle), and 10 cm (bottom).
