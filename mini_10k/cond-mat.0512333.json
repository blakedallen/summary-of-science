The interest focuses on the 3d transition metal ferromagnets and their alloys, since one may now synthesize\ndiverse ultrasmall magnetic structures of very high quality from them. It is the case as well devices are fabricated\nfrom these materials, in which ferromagnetism is realized even well above room temperature. It is very clear that\none encounters damping mechanisms not present in the bulk crystalline form of the constituents. That this is so has\nbeen evident for many years now1 . The primary question then centers on the origin of the new damping mechanisms\noperational in nanomagnetic structures.\nOf course, the electronic structure of such entities may differ substantially from that in the bulk crystalline matter, by\nvirtue of distortions of the lattice associated with the mismatch in lattice constant between the film and the substrate.\nIn addition, a large fraction of the moment bearing ions sit at interfaces or on surfaces, and this will influence the\nelectronic structure as well. Hence, if the Gilbert damping constant G is used as a measure of the damping found for\nlong wavelength spin motions, one may expect intrinsic differences between the values of G appropriate to nanoscale\nstructures, and that appropriate to bulk materials.\nIt is now very clear from diverse experimental studies that the damping mechanisms operative in ultrathin ferromagnets do not have their origin only in differences between the electronic structure of bulk and nanoscale matter.\nEvidently distinct new mechanisms are present. For instance, an earlier analysis of data on ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) linewidths show a dependence on growth conditions whose influence on electronic structure is surely rather\nindirect1 . A few years ago, it was argued2 that a mechanism referred to as two magnon damping can be activated\nby defects on the surface or at interfaces. The density and character of such defects is clearly influenced by the\nmanner in which the film is grown. The theory of two magnon damping makes explicit predictions regarding the\nfrequency variation of the linewidth and its dependence on the orientation of the magnetization2,3 . Also, Rezende\nand his colleagues have demonstrated that it accounts quantitatively for the strong wave vector dependence found\nupon comparing linewidths measured in FMR, and those measured in Brillouin light scattering (BLS)4 . We refer the\nreader to a review article which describes the theory of two magnon damping in ultrathin ferromagnetic films, and\nthe experimental evidence for its presence5 .\nTwo magnon damping is an extrinsic mechanism activated by defects on or within an ultrathin film. In the\n\n\f2\nrecent literature, experimental evidence has been presented for the presence of a mechanism operative in ultrathin\nferromagnetic film structures which is intrinsic in character6. It should be remarked that Berger7 and Slonczewski8\npredicted this mechanism should be present in ultrathin films in advance of the experiments. Suppose we consider\nan ultrathin film of a ferromagnetic metal placed on a metallic substrate. The magnetic moments in an ultrathin\nferromagnetic film are embedded in a sea of conducting electrons which, of course also have spins and magnetic\nmoments. As the magnetic moments are excited in an FMR or BLS experiment, they precess coherently. Angular\nmomentum is transferred to the conduction electrons, and this is transported across the interface between the film\nand the substrate in the form of a spin current. Thus, spin angular momentum is lost from the ferromagnetic film, and\nthe spin motions are damped as a consequence. This source of damping is referred to as the spin pumping mechanism.\nAs the ferromagnetic film is made progressively thicker, the spin pumping contribution to the linewidth decreases\nroughly inversely with the film thickness, according to theory. This behavior is found in the experimental data.\nBy now, numerous theoretical descriptions have been given for the spin pumping contribution to the linewidth. In\nthe early papers cited in the previous paragraphs7,8 a simple phenomenological picture of the ferromagnetic metal\nand the surrounding materials is employed. The magnetic moments are described as localized moments, with ~s(~l) the\nspin angular momentum associated with lattice site ~l. Such local moments are assumed to be coupled to a conduction\nelectron bath, modeled as free electrons in quantum wells. These interact with the local moments via the classical sd\n~ ~l) * ~\u03c3 , with ~\u03c3 the conduction electron spin. Within such a framework, general features of\nexchange interaction \u2212J S(\nthe spin pumping mechanism may be elucidated, but quantitative predictions for specific materials are not contained\nin such simple descriptions.\nWithin such a framework, Simanek and Heinrich9 introduced an elegant picture of the origin of the spin pumping\ncontribution to the linewidth. A ferromagnetic film with static magnetization placed in contact with a non magnetic\nmetal induces RKKY spin oscillations in the non magnetic material. If the magnetization of the ferromagnet precesses\nat a finite frequency, the RKKY oscillations do not quite follow the magnetization of the substrate. In essence, the\nRKKY coupling is frequency dependent. If the frequency dependent RKKY interaction is expanded in powers of the\nfrequency, the lowest order linear term in the effective equation of motion of the magnetization provides a contribution\nto the effective damping constant felt by the ferromagnetic spins. In Ref. [9], only a single layer of localized spins\nwas considered, embedded within an electron gas. One of the present authors has elaborated on this basic scheme\nby considering N layers of local moments to simulate a multilayer film, with conduction electrons described by a\nquantum well picture10 . A prediction which emerges from this model is that the spin pumping contribution to the\nlinewidth does not fall off simply like 1/D, with D the thickness of the ferromagnetic film. Quantum oscillations are\nsuperimposed on this 1/D falloff. Further discussion of this approach has been presented by Simanek11 .\nA rather different approach has been taken by Tserkovnyak and his colleagues12 . These authors use a one electron\npicture, in which the electron wave functions extend over the entire structure considered, the ferromagnetic film and\nthe non magnetic metals which are in contact with it. Spin precession within the ferromagnetic film is introduced\nby virtue of a postulated form for a time dependent density matrix. The flow of spin angular momentum out of\nthe ferromagnetic film in the presence of the spin precession is described in terms of the transmission and reflection\ncoefficients associated with appropriate scattering states. Recently a study by this group has appeared where density\nfunctional electronic structure calculations are employed to calculate spin pumping contributions to the linewidth for\nspecific material combinations13 . The agreement with experimental data which follows from this analysis is very good,\nthough we note that the theory explores an ultrathin ferromagnetic film bounded on both sides by a semi infinite non\nmagnetic metal, a structure quite different than employed in the actual experiments. The authors conclude that the\noscillations found within the quantum well model of Ref. [10] are in fact very modest in amplitude when a proper\nelectronic structure is employed. We remark that in the series of calculations which motivate the present paper, we\nfind similar results.\nIn this paper, we address the calculation of spin pumping linewidths for various ultrathin film/substrate combinations by a method quite different than found in the studies cited above. We calculate directly the full frequency\nspectrum of the response of diverse structures to applied microwave fields whose wave vector parallel to the surfaces of\nthe structures is zero, within the framework of a method which provides a realistic description of the electronic structure of the sample of interest. We extract linewidths by fitting the lines in the absorption spectra with a Lorentzian,\nvery much as done in experimental analyses of actual data. As remarked above, we note that the formalism employed\nby the authors of Ref. [12] and Ref. [13] requires the ferromagnetic film to be bounded on both sides by non magnetic\nmetals of semi infinite extent, since the reflection and transmission coefficients required are found from scattering\nstates associated with electrons reflected from and transmitted through the ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Our method\nallows us to address the more realistic case of an ultrathin film adsorbed on a semi infinite substrate, bounded by\nvacuum (or if we wish a capping layer) on the other side. As we shall demonstrate below, we can also calculate the\nlinewidths of trilayers adsorbed on a semi infinite substrate, so we can study the linewidth of both the acoustic and\noptical spin wave modes. Such structures have been explored by the Baberschke group14 . While, for reasons discussed\nbelow, it is difficult to make a detailed comparison between our results and their data, we do see features in our re-\n\n\f3\nsults rather similar to those found experimentally. Also, we obtain an excellent account of the linewidths reported\nin Ref. [6] for ultrathin films of Fe adsorbed on the Au(100) surface. We have also examined other film/substrate\ncombinations with the aim of exploring the influence of the electronic structure of the substrate and the local atomic\ngeometry at the interface on the spin pumping contribution to the linewidth.\nThe calculations reported here employ the formalism and methodology we developed earlier15 which was employed in\nour successful quantitative account16 of the frequencies, linewidths and lineshapes associated with large wave vector\nspin waves excited in spin polarized electron energy loss (SPEELS) studies of Co films adsorbed on the Cu(100)\nsurface17 . The very large linewidths found in these experiments have their origin in the same process which enters the\nspin pumping contribution to the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth: in these itinerant materials, the collective\nspin wave mode is damped by virtue of the transfer of angular momentum to band electrons. The spin pumping FMR\nlinewidth then may be viewed as the zero wave vector limit of the large linewidths found in the SPEELS data. It is\nthe case, then, that this contribution linewidth has a strong dependence on wave vector parallel to the surface, for\nwave vector variations on the scale of the surface Brillouin zone. It is also the case that our methodology has led to\nquantitative accounts of both the nature of the spin excitation spectrum18 , and the damping rates associated with\nthese modes throughout the entire surface Brillouin zone.\nIn section II of this paper, we discuss our approach and comment on aspects of the numerical computations. Our\nresults are discussed in section III, and section IV is devoted to concluding remarks.\nII.\n\nCOMMENTS ON THE ANALYSIS\n\nThe approach we have employed has been discussed in detail in our earlier publications15,16 , so we summarize it\nonly briefly here. The most detailed discussion is to be found in the first reference cited in Ref. [15]. As remarked\nin section I, we employ an empirical tight binding description of the electronic structure of the various constituents\nin the samples we model. Nine bands are included for each material. These are the four sp bands supplemented\nby the d band complex. Ferromagnetism in the relevant films is driven by intratomic, on site Coulomb interactions\nthat operate within the d shell. We refer to the model Hamiltonian as a generalized Hubbard model. A description\nof the ground state is generated in mean field theory, allowing the magnitude of the moments in each plane of each\nferromagnetic film to vary. In an early publication, we have shown that our approach provides results for the magnetic\nmoment profile of the film and layer dependent partial wave density of states in very good accord with those generated\nby full density functional calculations19 .\nWe then generate a description of the frequency spectrum of spin fluctuations in the film through calculating the\nappropriate wave vector frequency dependent transverse susceptibility. This is done through use of the Random Phase\nApproximation (RPA) of many body theory, which is a 1\"conserving approximation.\" The quantity we generate by\n~ k , \u03a9; l\u22a5 , l\u2032 ). It has the following physical meaning. Suppose the magnetizations of\nthis means is written \u03c7+,\u2212 (Q\n\u22a5\nthe various ferromagnetic films in the structure are parallel to the z axis. Then apply a circularly polarized, space\n~ k * ~lk \u2212 i\u03a9t]. Here a lattice\nand time dependent field in the xy plane of the form ~h(~lk , l\u22a5 ) = h(l\u22a5 ){x\u0302 + i\u0177} exp[iQ\n~\n~\n~\nsite in the structure is denoted by l = lk + n\u0302l\u22a5 , where lk lies in the plane parallel to the film surfaces, and n\u0302 is a\n~ k lies in the two dimensional surface Brillouin zone of the\nvector perpendicular to the surfaces.

(3) provides one with an understanding of the information contained in the spectral density function.\nOf course, it would be highly desirable to base the analysis of the spin dynamics of systems such as we explore\nthrough use of a state of the art density functional description of the ground state, combined with a time dependent\ndensity functional analysis (TDDFA) of the spin fluctuation spectrum. At the time of this writing, one cannot carry\nout studies of the spin fluctuation spectrum within the TDDFA for systems as large as we have studied in the past15,16\nand that we explore in the present paper. The demands on computation time are prohibitive. We believe it is essential\nto employ fully semi infinite substrates for proper calculations of spin wave linewidths with origin in decay of the\ncollective excitations to the Stoner excitation manifold. One must have a true continuum of final states for a proper\ndescription of the linewidth. All of our calculations employ a full semi infinite substrate, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe virtue of our multi band Hubbard model is that once the irreducible particle hole propagator is computed,\ninversion of the RPA integral equation is straightforward and fast, by virtue of the fact that the particle-hole vertex\nis separable in momentum space within our framework. TDDFA calculations employ an ab initio generated vertex\nfunction which requires the numerical solution of a full integral equation, once the irreducible particle hole propagator\nis in hand. One can handle only rather small systems within this framework, at present.\nIf one describes our treatment of the ground state and then the RPA description of the spin dynamics by Feynman\ndiagrams, it is the case that we include the same set of diagrams as incorporated into the full density functional\ntheory, so in a certain sense one may view what we do as a simplified version of time dependent density functional\ntheory. However, technical simplifications such as those described in the previous paragraph enable us to address very\nlarge systems. We note that our calculations involve no adjustable parameters, since all of our input parameters are\ntaken from the appropriate literature. A rather detailed discussion of how we proceed is contained in Ref. [19], and\nconsiderable detail is found in the first paper cited in Ref. [15].\nIn spite of the remarks above, it is the case that the numerical work involved in the calculation of the dynamical\nsusceptibility is extremely demanding from the computational point of view. As discussed in detail in the first paper\ncited in Ref. [15], to calculate the irreducible particle hole propagator it is necessary to calculate an energy integral\nwhose integrand is itself a two dimensional integral over the full surface Brillouin zone. We have also shown that very\ncareful attention must be paid to convergence of the Brillouin zone integrations for physically reasonable results to\n\u2032\nemerge from \u03c7+,\u2212 (\u03a9; l\u22a5 , l\u22a5\n). We refer the reader to Fig. 6 of the first paper in Ref. [15] and the associated discussion\nin the text. We find that 4224 points in the surface Brillouin zone must be employed to insure proper convergence.\nThe irreducible particle hole propagator is a matrix structure, whose size is the number of layers in the film, N, times\nthe number of orbitals included in the calculation. Thus, for us to analyze spin fluctuations in a 10 layer ferromagnetic\nfilm, we must perform the Brillouin zone integration just described for a 90 \u00d7 90 matrix. For films deposited on semi\ninfinite substrates, of course we require the single particle Green's function for the semi infinite structure. This part\nof the computation also consumes a considerable fraction of the total computing time.\nFortunately, the problem in question can be easily adapted to run in parallel on a cluster of workstations. We\nadopted a very straightforward parallelization strategy, in which we spread 64 points of energy integration among 32\nprocessors. For interprocess communication, we use the MPICH implementation20 of the Message Passing Interface\n(MPI)21 . The interprocess communication overhead for this specific problem is minimal, so that the execution time\nscales roughly linearly with the number of processors. This allows us to calculate the dynamic susceptibility of\nrelatively thick ferromagnetic films (\u223c 15 layers) on a fully semi infinite substrate, in a relatively short time. A\ncomputation of the frequency response for one film can be performed in less than 48 hours. Typically to generate the\nabsorption spectra shown in section III, we use one hundred frequencies.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn our previous studies of spin waves in various ultrathin film/substrate combinations, our emphasis was on excitations with relatively large wave vectors. The excitation energies of such modes are very large compared to the Zeeman\nenergy, which describes the interaction of the spins in the system with externally applied field. Thus the external field\nwas taken to be zero in all of our previous studies. Here, when we examine the modes whose wave vector is identically\nzero, with emphasis on the modes seen in FMR experiments, quite clearly we must incorporate the externally applied\nmagnetic field. In the results that follow, we have immersed all the electrons in a spatially uniform Zeeman field, and\nwe denote the precession frequency in this Zeeman field by \u03a90 .\n\n\f5\nWe should say a few words about how the strength of the Zeeman field has been chosen. First of all, the energy\nscale used in our electronic structure is the electron volt, or equivalently the Rydberg. The spin excitations we studied\nin our earlier papers had energies compatible with this scale, in the range of 0.01 eV to 0.3 eV15,16 depending on the\nwave vector we chose to study. If we choose our applied Zeeman field to be in the range actually used in laboratory\nexperiments, then the energy scale of the FMR mode is so small (\u223c 10\u22125 eV) that an enormous amount of computation\ntime would be required to produce calculations with an energy grid so fine as to allow us to generate accurate profiles\nfor these very low energy modes. It is the case, however, that so long as \u03a90 is very small compared to the typical\nelectronic energy scales, the linewidths scale linearly with resonance frequency. We remark that we have checked\ncarefully that this is so, in our early studies. So long as we remain in the regime where the linewidth scales in this\nlinear manner, we may choose an unphysically large value for \u03a90 , and scale the computed linewidths appropriately\nwhen we compare our results with data. What we choose to do instead is always to plot the ratio \u2206\u03a90 , \u03a90 , with \u2206\u03a90\nthe linewidth determined as discussed below. This is independent of applied field, in the regime where the linearly\nscaling holds. In the calculations to be presented in this paper, we have chosen \u03a90 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 Rydbergs =27 meV.\nIn Fig. (1a), we show the absorption spectrum for the FMR mode (the lowest lying spin wave mode of the film,\nwith wave vector parallel to the film surface identically equal to zero) of a two layer Co film adsorbed on the Cu(100)\nsurface. One sees the resonance line, with peak very close to \u03a90 . In principle, there can be a g shift associated with\nthis mode even in the absence of spin orbit coupling, since strictly speaking the amplitude of the spin motion in the\ndirection normal to the surface is not perfectly uniform. In our earlier studies of the electron spin resonance response\nof isolated magnetic adatoms adsorbed on the Cu(100) surface, we found such g shifts to be quite large. Here we find\nthat the peak of the absorption line coincides exactly with \u03a90 , so far as we can tell.\nThere is another idealization we have made that must be mentioned. In an actual sample, where a ferromagnetic\nfilm is on top of a nonmagnetic substrate such as Cu, when the spins precess in the ferromagnet, dynamic dipolar\nfields are generated by the spin motion. Thus, for a film magnetized parallel to its surfaces, the FMR frequency is\n1\nshifted from \u03a90 = \u03b3H0 to \u03b3[H0 (H0 + 4\u03c0Ms )] 2 , where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio for the ferromagnetic film, H0 is\nthe applied Zeeman field, and Ms is the saturation magnetization. It is also the case that the gyromagnetic ratio for\nthe ferromagnetic film will differ from that of the conduction electrons in the substrate. Thus, in an actual sample,\nthe precession frequency of the spins in the ultrathin ferromagnetic film will differ from that for electrons in the\nsubstrate. We have explored the influence of this effect by varying the ratio of the Zeeman frequency of the spins in\nthe ferromagnet, to that of the spins in the substrate by as much as a factor of two. We find that our linewidths,\nnormalized to the resonance frequency in the ferromagnet, are insensitive to this difference. On physical grounds\none expects this. In microscopic language, the linewidths we calculate have their origin on the transfer of angular\nmomentum from the coherently precessing moments in the ferromagnet to the bath of itinerant band electrons. If\nwe think of this as a form of Landau damping, where the spin wave decays to the bath of Stoner excitations of the\nfilm/substrate complex (spin triplet particle hole excitations), a shift in the precession frequency of the ferromagnetic\nfilm relative to that of the substrate electrons is compensated by a very tiny shift in the wave vector transfer involved\nin the decay process, on the scale of the relevant two dimensional Brillouin zone. Note that wave vector components\nnormal to the surface are not conserved for the systems we study. Thus, in Fig. 1(a) and in the results to be\ndiscussed below, all electrons in the system are subjected to the same external field, and are assumed to have the\nsame gyromagnetic ratio, with dipolar fields in the ferromagnet ignored.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we show calculations of the of a Co2 Cu2 Co2 trilayer adsorbed on a semi infinite Cu(100) surface.\nOne now sees two modes, the acoustical and the optical spin wave mode of the ferromagnetic bilayer. It is clear from\nvisual inspection that the acoustical mode is narrower than the FMR line shown in Fig 1(a), while the optical mode\nis substantially broader, a pattern seen in experimental studies of such systems14 . It should be noted that in Fig.\n1(b), it is not quite the FMR absorption spectrum that is displayed. For two such identical films, the antisymmetric\noptical spin wave mode has no net transverse magnetic moment, and thus would be silent in an FMR spectrum. In\nactual FMR experiments where both modes are observed, the two ferromagnetic films are inequivalent. What we\n~ k = 0, \u03a9; l), where we have taken l\u22a5 = 1, where the 1 refers\ndisplay in Fig. 1(b) is the spectral density function A(Q\nto the outermost layer of the outermost film. The physical interpretation of this spectral density function is that it\ndescribes the frequency spectrum of the fluctuations of the spins in the atomic layer indicated, at zero wave vector\nparallel to the surface. The acoustic and optical spin wave both leave their signature on this response function.\nOne final remark is that our procedure for determining the linewidths discussed below is as follows. For each\nstructure of interest, we calculate a spectrum such as that illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b). Then we fit the\ncurves to appropriate Lorentizians, and from this we extract a linewidth. The quantity \u2206\u03a9 is the half width at half\nmaximum.\nThe first case we discuss is that of Fe films adsorbed on the Au(100) surface. This is the system studied by Urban,\nWoltersdorf and Heinrich6 .\nIn Fig. 2, we show our calculated linewidths as open circles, for Fe film thicknesses in the range of two to ten\nmonolayers. The solid line is a best power law fit to the data, which turns out to be 1/(NFe )0.98 law, with NFe the\n\n\f6\nnumber of Fe layers. Various authors7,8,12 have argued that the spin pumping linewidth should fall off inversely with\nthe thickness of the ferromagnetic film, so these result are consistent with this picture. Our calculations show this\nbehavior nicely. For small thicknesses, we see oscillations of modest amplitude around the 1/NFe law. These are\nquantum oscillations such as those discussed in Ref. [10], though as discussed by the authors of Ref. [13] the simple\nquantum well model exaggerates their amplitude.\nThe solid circles in Fig. 2 are data taken from Ref. [6]. Theory and experiment agree very nicely. Unfortunately it\nis difficult for us to carry out calculations for films much thicker than ten layers for the FMR mode. In our integrations\nover energy, a small imaginary part is added to energy denominators, and we must always keep this small compared\nto the linewidth. We must decrease this as the film gets thicker, and at the same time we must increase the density of\npoints in our integration grids to generate a reliable, converged line shape uninfluenced by the numerical procedures.\nIt is interesting to inquire how the linewidth depends on the electronic structure of the substrate. To explore this,\nwe have carried out calculations for anFe film deposited on the W(110) surface. While we are unaware of any FMR\nstudies of this system, the magnetism associated with the Fe/W(110) system has been extensively studied in the\nliterature. Our results are given in Fig. 3. The straight line is a best fit to a power law dependence on the Fe film\nthickness, and in this case we find 1/(NFe )0.81 , just a bit slower that a simple variation inversely proportional to the\nfilm thickness. However, we again see quantum oscillations about a simple power law fit, at smaller thickness, so a\nsimple power law is a bit of an oversimplification. Surprisingly, in our view, the numerical values of the linewidths\ndisplayed in Fig. 3 are not so very different than those in Fig. 2. We had expected larger linewidths, because of the\nlarge density of states in the substrate associated with the unfilled d bands of W. It should be pointed out, however,\nthat the connectivity of an Fe film is larger when it is adsorbed on Au(100) than when it is adsorbed on W(110).\nAn Fe atom at the interface with the Au(100) surface is connected to four nearest neighbor Au atoms, whereas it is\ncoupled to just two nearest neighbor W atoms in the Fe/W(110) interface. One virtue of our empirical tight binding\napproach is that we can probe the physics responsible for results such as these by artificially selecting parameters.\nWe turn to such studies next, to obtain insight into this result.\nIt is interesting to compare the calculated linewidths for an Fe film adsorbed on W(110), and for an identical film\nadsorbed on a bcc Cu crystal, which we can simulate with our approach. Here the connectivity to the substrates\nis the same. Of course, in the first case the Fermi level intersects the d band complex of the substrate, whereas in\nthe second case the d bands are well below the Fermi level. For the cases of a two layer Fe film on W(110) we see\nfrom Fig. 3 that \u2206\u03a9/\u03a90 assumes the value 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 , whereas for the Fe film on Cu(110), the line is actually a bit\nbroader, with \u2206\u03a9/\u03a90 = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 . Even though the two numbers are rather close to each other, it would seem that\nthe physics which underlies the transfer of spin angular momentum across the interface is rather different in the two\ncases. In Fig. 4, we show calculations which illustrate this. Let us first look at the right panel, the case of Fe on\nW(110). The solid curve is the spectral density calculated with use of the full electronic structure. The dashed curve\nis a calculation in which the d-d hopping terms are set to zero across the interface. The line narrows very substantially\nwhen the d-d hopping is shut off, as we see. Evidently for this case, direct communication between the d electrons in\nthe Fe film and the W substrate plays a central role in the transfer of spin angular momentum. The electrons at the\nW Fermi surface have strong d character, and the electrons in the Fe with strong sp character play a minor role in\nthe damping process. This view is reinforced by the dot dash curve in the right hand panel of Fig. 4, where the sp\nhopping terms are set to zero across the interface. We see little change in the spectral density. The situation is very\ndifferent for the case of Fe on Cu(110), as we see from the left hand panel in Fig. 4. We see here that communication\nbetween both the sp and the d like portions of the electronic wave function across the interface play an important role.\nEven though the 3d bands of Cu are completely filled, there is d character admixed in the electron wave functions\nin the vicinity of the Fermi energy, while at the same time coupling through the sp character of the wave function\nenters as well. Thus, while the final numbers for the spin pumping contributions to the linewidth are rather similar\nfor these two very different substrates, the physical picture which underlies the transfer of spin angular momentum\nacross the interface is rather different. In view of this discussion, it would be of great interest to see experimental\nFMR linewidth studies for the case of Fe on W(110).\nWe turn next to a discussion of our calculation of linewidths of the FMR modes of ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic\nmetal/ferromagnetic film combinations adsorbed on semi infinite substrates. We have already seen that such structures\nproduce two features in the absorption spectrum, one from an acoustic spin wave mode, and one from an optical mode.\nThe splitting between these two modes is controlled by the well known interfilm exchange coupling transmitted through\nthe non magnetic spacer layer. As remarked above, if one has a sample with two identical ferromagnetic films, only\nthe acoustical mode is active in an FMR experiment, since the optical mode possesses no net transverse magnetic\nmoment. In samples fabricated from ultrathin films, the thickness of the trilayer is small compared to the microwave\nskin depth, so to excellent approximation the films are illuminated by a spatially uniform magnetic field. We note\nthat in Brillouin light scattering, one may observe both modes, since the optical skin depth is in the range of 10-20\nnm for materials of current interest. Here, the exciting optical field is spatially non uniform, on the length scale\nof the structure. It is the case, though, that in any real sample, the two films will always be inequivalent even if\n\n\f7\ntheir thicknesses are the same. For instance, both interfaces of the innermost film are in contact with non magnetic\nmetals, with the substrate on one side and the spacer layer on the other. The outer film has vacuum on one side, and\nthe spacer layer on the other. Hence, the anisotropy fields will be different in each film, and this will render them\ninequivalent. As discussed below, we have simulated such effects by applying different external magnetic fields to each\nfilm. First, however, we present our results for the case where the two ferromagnetic films are regarded as identical\nin character.\nBefore we turn to our results, we remark on how we proceed with our determination of the linewidths for the\noptical and the acoustical mode of the trilayer structure. In Fig. 1(b), we show the spectral density function for a\ncase where the Cu spacer layer is sufficiently thin that the two modes can be resolved easily in the spectral density\nassociated with one selected layer. As the Cu spacer is made thicker, the splitting between the two modes decreases\nand if we plot the spectral function illustrated in Fig 1(b), we simply see a single asymmetric line, with the optical\nmode buried in the wing of the acoustical\nas follows.\nFor each frequency, we form a two\nP mode. We have proceeded\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\nby two matrix with elements \u03c711 =\nIm{\u03c7+,\u2212 (0, \u03a9; l\u22a5 , l\u22a5\n), \u03c712 =\nIm{\u03c7+,\u2212 (0, \u03a9; l\u22a5 , l\u22a5\n)} and so on. In\nl\u22a5 ,l\u2032\u22a5 \u01eb1\n\n\u2032\nl\u22a5\n\nl\u22a5 \u01eb1,l\u2032\u22a5 \u01eb2\n\nthe definition of \u03c711 , the sums on both l\u22a5 and\nrange over the atomic planes in the outermost film, while in \u03c712 the\n\u2032\nsum on l\u22a5 ranges over the atomic planes of the outermost film, and the sum over l\u22a5\nranges over the atomic planes of\nthe innermost film. Diagonalization of this matrix at each frequency leads us to two eigenvectors, one with acoustical\ncharacter and one with optical character. If we generate plots of the spectral densities of these two characteristic\nmotions, in one we see only the acoustical feature, and in the second we see only the optical feature. We illustrate\nthis in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a) we show the spectral density function associated with spin fluctuations in the innermost\nlayer of the inner film of a Co2 Cu4 Co2 /Cu(100) structure. The optical mode appears in the wing of the acoustical\nmode, and one cannot reliably extract a width for the mode from this response function. In Fig. 5(b) we see how one\nmay isolate the acoustical mode by the procedure just describe, and in Fig. 5(c) we show the optical mode.\nWe remark that for the samples studied experimentally in Ref. [3], the two ferromagnetic films in the trilayer have\nvery different resonance frequencies when taken in isolation, so the issue of discriminating between the two modes did\nnot arise. Save for one measurement discussed below, the trilayer structures studied in Ref. [3] may be viewed as two\noscillators whose resonance frequencies differ by an amount much larger than their linewidths, coupled weakly by the\ninterfilm exchange coupling mediated by the spacer layer.\nIn our earlier studies of large wave vector spin waves and their dispersion16 we have compared the dispersion relation\nwhich emerges from our dynamical theory with that calculated on the basis of adiabatic theory, where exchange\ncouplings between spins are calculated within quasi static theory, and a Heisenberg Hamiltonian constructed from\nthese is used to generate a spin wave dispersion curve. We found substantial differences between the two cases. The\nstrong damping present at large wave vectors leads to shifts in the frequency of the spin wave. This effect, which\nsoftens the modes, is not contained in calculations based on an adiabatic description of energy changes associated with\nrotations of the moments. One can inquire if the effective interfilm exchange couplings deduced from the splitting\nbetween the acoustical and optical spin wave modes of the trilayer are the same as those described by adiabatic theory.\nWe provide a comparison which addresses this issue in Fig. 6. The solid line shows the dependence of the interfilm\ncoupling strength on N , the number of Cu layers between the two Co2 films, calculated adiabatically using the method\nin Ref. [23]. The dashed line provides the results deduced from the splitting between the two spin wave modes of the\nstructure. The two agree rather well, though there are indeed small differences between the two.\nIt is evident that we find the wide of the optical mode of the trilayer significantly larger than that of the acoustic\nmode. This is consistent with the results reported in Ref. [14], as noted earlier. Very interesting to us is the data\nin Fig. (6) of Ref. [14], where the linewidth measured for these two modes is given as a function of the number of\nCu layers between the two ferromagnetic films. One sees very clear quantum oscillations in these two linewidths. In\nour Fig. 7, we show calculations of the variation of the acoustic and optic mode linewidths with N , the number of\nCu spacer layers in our Co2 CuN Co2 /Cu(100) structure. The calculations reproduce the features found in the data\nstrikingly well. For instance, in our calculations we see a peak in the linewidth of the acoustic mode at six atomic\nlayers of Cu and a second somewhat smaller peak at nine layers. Both features appear in the data, indeed with the\npeak at six layers the most prominent, Also very much as in the data, for the optical mode we see the peak at six\nlayers in our calculations, while the peak at nine layers is suppressed strongly. In our calculations, the optical mode\nlinewidth, reckoned relative to that of the acoustic mode, is larger than that in the data. At the peak at six layers, we\nfind the width of the optical mode larger than that of the acoustical mode by a factor of roughly five, whereas in the\ndata this ratio is a bit less than a factor of two. A direct comparison of this ratio with the data is not so relevant in\nour minds, since the resonance frequencies of our two Co2 films (each taken in isolation) are identical, whereas that\nof the Co1.8 film and the Ni9 film used in Ref. [14] are different.\nSome of the data in Ref. [14] has been taken on Ni8 CuN Ni9 /Cu(100) samples. The resonance frequencies of the\nNi8 and Ni9 films differ substantially when the externally applied field is in plane, presumably because of the near\nproximity of these Ni films to the spin reorientation transition. However, the authors of Ref. [14] were able to sweep\n\n\f8\nthe resonance frequency of one film through the second by varying the angle of the extermal applied magnetic field\nwith respect to the plane of the films. They argue that the linewidths of the two modes approach each other when\nthe resonance frequencies coincide. This is illustrated in their Fig. 4, for a sample with N = 12. For such a thick\ncopper spacer layer, the interfilm exchange coupling is negligible.\nWe can simulate this with our Co2 CuN Co2 /Cu(100) structures by applying a different magnetic field to each film.\nIn Fig. 8 we present results of a study where the resonance frequency of the outer film is \u03a90 and that of the inner\nfilm is \u03bb\u03a90 , where \u03bb is varied from 1 to 2. By varying \u03bb, we can study how the linewidth of each mode behaves if the\ntwo films initially are detuned (\u03bb = 2), and then brought to the point where the isolated film resonance frequencies\ncoincide (\u03bb = 1). Our calculations are carried out for N = 10, where the interfilm exchange coupling is very weak.\nWe presume the authors of Ref. [14] have fitted their FMR spectra to a sum of two Lorentizians in order to extract\nthe width of the two modes. We have attempted a similar procedure with simulations of the FMR absorption spectrum\nof the structure. However, we find that when \u03bb is fairly close to unity, we cannot reliably extract linewidths for the\ntwo modes by fitting the overall spectral density in this manner. In Fig. 8(a), the solid line shows the absorption\nspectrum of the trilayer for the case where \u03bb = 1.2, and we see the high frequency mode as a barely perceptible\n4\n4\nP\nP\n\u2032\nIm{\u03c7+,\u2212 (0, \u03a9; l\u22a5 , l\u22a5\n)}.\nfeature on the high frequency side of the line. The solid line is the function a(\u03a9) =\nl\u2032\u22a5 =1 l\u22a5 =1\n\nThis gives the absorption spectrum of the trilayer, if it is illuminated by a spatially uniform microwave field. Also\nin Fig, 8(a), we give the absorption spectrum for the outer film by displaying A1 (\u03a9), defined in a manner similar to\nA(\u03a9), except the spatial sums are now confined to the outer film. Similarly, A2 (\u03a9) is the absorption spectrum of the\ninner film. We have found that we can only extract linewidths meaningfully from our simulations if we isolate the\noptical and acoustical modes by the procedure outlined earlier in this section. Of course, this cannot be done from\nexperimental FMR spectra. In Fig. 8(b), we show the variation of the linewidths of the two modes with \u03bb. We see\nthat \u03bb is decreased from the value 2 toward unity, the optical mode linewidth indeed approaches that of the acoustical\nmode, but then when \u03bb comes close to 1, the linewidths diverge. The acoustic mode narrows, and the optical mode\nbroadens, as we have seen for the calculations presented earlier where \u03bb was taken to be unity.\nIV.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS\n\nIn this paper, through analysis of spectral densities calculated at zero wave vector, we have extracted linewidths of\nthe FMR modes of the structures we have explored. The origin of these linewidths, which are built into the theoretical\nmethodology we have presented in the earlier paper, is in the spin pumping mechanism discussed elsewhere in the\nliterature. We have seen that we obtain an excellent account of the linewidths reported in Ref. [6] for Fe films on\nAu(100), and we also obtain a very good description of the quantum oscillations in linewidth reported in Ref. [14],\nfor both the acoustical and optical modes of ferromagnetic trilayers grown on the Cu(100) surface.\nThese calculations employ the same theoretical methodology that we have developed and applied earlier to the\nanalysis of the SPLEED data reported in Ref. [17]. In the SPLEED measurements, of course, it is large wave vector\nspin excitations that are studied. In Ref. [16], we obtained an excellent account of the dispersion of the single, broad\nasymmetric feature seen in SPEELS, along with an excellent account of both its width and asymmetric lineshape.\nThus, the calculations presented in the present paper show that our method accounts very nicely for the damping\nof spin motions in these ultrathin films throughout the two dimensional Brillouin zone, from the zero wave vector\nexcitations explored in the FMR experiments to the large wave vectors probed by SPEELS.\nIt is interesting to offer a physical viewpoint of the FMR linewidths calculated here that is somewhat different\n(but complementary to) that set forward in papers devoted specifically to FMR linewidths. First, suppose we were\nto consider the FMR linewidth in an infinitely extended, three dimensional crystal described by a model such as\nwe use here, in which electron energy bands result from interactions of electrons with the crystal potential, and\nferromagnetism is driven by Coulomb interactions between the electrons. The FMR mode is the infinite wavelength,\nor zero wave vector mode of the system. Since such a Hamiltionian is form invariant under rigid rotations of the\nspins, the Goldstone theorem require the linewidth of the zero wave vector mode to be identically zero. This is\na rigorous statement, independent of approximations used in any specific calculation to study spin waves. Our\nmean field description of the ground state combined with the RPA description of the spin dynamics, is a conserving\napproximation and thus all of our conclusions are compatible with the Goldstone theorem. At zero field we will then\nfind a width of identically zero, for the zero wave vector spin wave of the infinitely extended crystal. In real materials,\nof course, there is a finite width to the FMR mode, described phenomenologically by the damping term in the well\nknown Landau Lifschitz Gilbert equation. The origin of the linewidth in real materials is the spin orbit interaction,\nsince its introduction into the Hamiltonian produces a structure no longer invariant under rigid body rotations of all\nspins in the system.\nNow when we place a thin ferromagnetic film on a non magnetic substrate, as in the systems considered here,\n\n\f9\ntranslational symmetry normal to the surface is broken, and only the components of wave vector parallel to the\n~ k = 0 is the FMR mode. This is not a uniform\nsurface remain good quantum numbers. The lowest lying mode with Q\nmode of the system, by virtue of the breakdown of translational symmetry normal to the surfaces; the amplitude\nof the spin motion in the non magnetic substrate differs from that in the ferromagnetic film, for instance. Hence,\neven in the absence of spin orbit coupling, one realizes a finite linewidth for this mode. This is a way of viewing the\n\"spin pumping\" contribution to the linewidth. Now in the limit that the thickness of the ferromagnetic film becomes\ninfinite, the FMR mode of the film must evolve into the uniform mode of the infinite crystal whose linewidth must\nvanish in the absence of spin orbit coupling. Hence the spin pumping contribution to the linewidth falls to zero, with\nincreasing ferromagnetic film thickness.\nOther questions will be interesting to explore. Our method will allow us to explore the wave vector dependence of\nthe linewidth, for example. Studies of this issue and other questions are underway presently.\nAcknowledgments\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, we have enjoyed stimulating conversations with Prof. B.

The calculations reported in ref. [15] and ref. [16] show that the adiabatic\napproximation breaks down qualitatively for ultrathin ferromagnetic films, and the picture of spin excitations just described\nis qualitatively incorrect. Instead, through most of the surface Brillouin zone, save for the near vicinity of the point, our\ntheory predicted that one has a single, broad feature in the frequency spectrum of spin fluctuations, which displays dispersion\nwith wave vector similar to that associated with a single spin wave branch. This picture is confirmed by the data reported\nin Ref. [17], and in Ref. [16] we demonstrate our approach provides a fully quantitative account of the data. An explicit\ncomparison between adiabatic or Heisenberg like calculations, and our full dynamical calculations see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 of\nRef. [16].\nH. Tang, M. Plihal and D. L. Mills, J.
