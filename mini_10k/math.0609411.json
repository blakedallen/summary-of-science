We obtain new lower bounds of the minimal genus of a locally flat\nsurface representing a 2-dimensional homology class in a topological 4-manifold\nwith boundary, using the von Neumann-Cheeger-Gromov \u03c1-invariant. As an\napplication our results are employed to investigate the slice genus of knots.\nWe illustrate examples with arbitrarily large slice genus for which our lower\nbound is optimal but all previously known invariants vanish.\n\n1. Introduction and main results\nThis paper concerns the problem of the minimal genus of a locally flat embedded surface representing a given 2-dimensional homology class in a topological\n4-manifold. Precisely, a locally flat closed surface \u03a3 in a topological 4-manifold W\nis said to represent \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (W ) if the fundamental class of \u03a3 is sent to \u03c3 under\nthe map induced by the inclusion. In this paper manifolds are always oriented and\nsurfaces are assumed to be connected.\nFor topological 4-manifolds which are closed (or with boundaries consisting of\nhomology spheres), there are remarkable known results which provide lower bounds\nof the minimal genus, including Kervaire-Milnor [KM61], Hsiang-Szczarba [HS71],\nRokhlin [Rok71], and Lee-Wilczy\u0144ski [LW97, LW00]. Basically these lower bounds\nare extracted by considering Rokhlin's theorem and algebraic topology of finite\ncyclic branched coverings. Also, interesting results on the smooth analogue of this\nproblem have been obtained using gauge theory for a certain class of smooth 4manifolds. Related works include results on the Thom conjecture and adjunction\ninequality due to Kronheimer-Mrowka [KM93, KM95b, KM95a], Morgan-Szab\u00f3Taubes [MST96], Kronheimer [Kro99], and Ozsv\u00e1th-Szab\u00f3 [OS00b, OS00a]. One\nmay obtain a lower bound in a 4-manifold with boundary when it embeds into\nanother 4-manifold for which the above lower bound results can be applied directly. For example, the adjunction inequality is proved in Stein 4-manifolds via an\nembedding theorem due to Lisca-Mati\u0107 [LM97, LM98, AM97].\nIn this paper we focus on the minimal genus problem in a topological 4-manifold\nwhich has boundary with nontrivial homology. Our results give new lower bounds\nof the minimal genus, for homology classes from the boundary, in terms of the von\nNeumann-Cheeger-Gromov \u03c1-invariants of the boundary. As an application we give\nlower bounds of the slice genus of a knot. Examples illustrate that the \u03c1-invariants\ndetect arbitrarily large minimal genus that all previously known results do not.\nMinimal second Betti number of a 4-dimensional bordism. We obtain lower\nbounds of the minimal genus through the following problem on 4-dimensional bordisms: what is the minimal second Betti number of a topological null-bordism of\na given closed 3-manifold endowed with a group homomorphism of the fundamental group? Our principal result on this is as follows. Let \u0393 be a poly-torsionfree-abelian (PTFA) group, i.e., \u0393 admits a finite length normal series {Gi } with\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57N13, 57N35, 57R95, 57M25.\nKey words and phrases. 4-manifold, Minimal Genus, Minimal Betti Number, Slice Genus,\nL2 -signature.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nGi /Gi+1 torsion-free abelian. It is known that there is a (skew-)field K of right\nquotients of Z\u0393. Let R be a subring of K which is a PID containing Z\u0393. Then\n\u0393 acts on the abelian group K/R via right multiplication so that the semi-direct\nproduct (K/R) \u22ca \u0393 is defined.\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose M is a closed 3-manifold endowed with a homomorphism\n\u03c6 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u0393, and W is a topological 4-manifold with boundary M such that \u03c6\nfactors through \u03c01 (W ). Then the followings hold:\n(1) The second Betti number \u03b22 (W ) satisfies\n|\u03c1(M, \u03c6)| \u2264 2\u03b22 (W )\nwhere \u03c1(M, \u03c6) \u2208 R denotes the von Neumann-Cheeger-Gromov \u03c1-invariant\nof M associated to \u03c6.\n(2) In addition, if the twisted homology H1 (M ; R) is R-torsion and not generated by any \u03b22 (W ) elements, then there is a nontrivial submodule P in\nHom(H1 (M ; R), K/R) such that every homomorphism in P gives rise to a\nlift \u03c61 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 (K/R) \u22ca \u0393 of \u03c6 which factors through \u03c01 (W ).\nMore detailed versions of Theorem 1.1 (1) and (2) are stated and proved in\nSection 2 and 3, respectively. To prove (1), we regard the \u03c1-invariant of M as\nan L2 -signature defect of W , and estimate the L2 -signature of W in terms of the\nL2 and ordinary Betti number. While (1) gives a lower bound of \u03b22 (W ) without\nusing (2), further information may be obtained when (2) is combined with (1); note\nthat (2) gives a sufficient condition which implies that a certain \"bigger\" coefficient\nsystem of M , namely \u03c61 , extends to W . In case that \u03c61 extends, (1) can be applied\nagain to \u03c61 to obtain further lower bounds of \u03b22 (W ) (and possibly this process may\nbe iterated).\nThis type of coefficient extension problem plays a crucial role in earlier landmark\nworks in knot theory, including Casson and Gordon [CG86, CG78], Gilmer [Gil82],\nand in particular Cochran, Orr, and Teichner [COT03, COT04], from which Theorem 1.1 has been directly motivated. In [COT03, COT04] the extension problem\nis investigated when H1 (\u2202W ; Q) \u223c\n= H1 (W ; Q) \u223c\n= Q and W satisfies some geometric\ncondition related to the existence of a Whitney tower (such W is called an (h)solution in [COT03]). In order to deal with the extension problem without assuming these conditions, as in Theorem 1.1 (2), we investigate the relationship of the\nBlanchfield linking form of M and the intersection form of W over R-coefficients,\nand import ideas from Gilmer's work [Gil82] on Casson-Gordon invariants.\nThe following result relates the minimal second Betti number of bordisms with\na particular type of the minimal genus problem in a 4-manifold with boundary.\nSuppose W is a topological 4-manifold with boundary M , H1 (W ) = 0, and \u03c3 is\na 2-dimensional homology class contained in the image of H2 (M ) \u2192 H2 (W ). In\nSection 4 we will describe a homomorphism \u03c6\u03c3 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 Z determined by \u03c3.\nProposition 1.2. If \u03c6\u03c3 is nontrivial and there is a locally flat embedded surface of\ngenus g in W representing \u03c3, then there is a topological 4-manifold V bounded by\nM such that \u03c6\u03c3 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 Z factors through \u03c01 (V ) and \u03b22 (V ) = \u03b22 (W ) + 2g \u2212 1.\nConsequently, lower bounds of \u03b22 (V ) obtained by (possibly repeatedly) applying\nTheorem 1.1 give rise to lower bounds of the genus g.\nSlice genus of a knot. As an application, we employ our results on the minimal\ngenus problem to investigate the slice genus of a knot K in S 3 . The topological slice\ngenus g\u2217t (K) of K is defined to be the minimal genus of a locally flat surface F\nproperly embedded in D4 in such a way that \u2202F = K, viewing S 3 as the boundary\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n3\n\nof D4 . The smooth slice genus g\u2217s (K) is defined similarly, requiring F to be a\nsmooth submanifold of D4 . Obviously g\u2217t (K) \u2264 g\u2217s (K).\nThere are various known lower bounds of the slice genus. Clearly any obstruction to being a slice knot can be viewed as a lower bound of the form (slice\ngenus) \u2265 1. It is well known that some invariants derived from a Seifert matrix, including the signature of a knot, can be used to detect higher topological\nslice genus. Gilmer showed that Casson-Gordon invariants of a knot K give further lower bounds of g\u2217t (K) [Gil82]. For the smooth slice genus, further results\nbased on gauge theory are known. For a special class of knots which includes the\ntorus knots, an optimal lower bound is obtained as an application of the Thom\nconjecture due to Mrowka-Kronheimer [KM93]. For an arbitrarily given knot K,\nthe Thurston-Bennequin invariant (together with the rotation invariant) of a Legendrian representation of K is known to give a lower bound of g\u2217s (K), due to\nRudolph [Rud95, Rud97], Kronheimer-Mrowka, Akbulut-Matveyev [AM97], and\nLisca-Mati\u0107 [LM97, LM98]. More recently, Ozsv\u00e1th-Szab\u00f3's \u03c4 -invariant [OS03] and\nRasmussen's s-invariant [Ras04] defined from knot homology theories of Ozsv\u00e1thSzab\u00f3 and Khovanov have been known to give new lower bounds of g\u2217s (K).\nIt is well-known that lower bounds of the slice genus can be obtained through\nminimal genus problems in 4-manifolds with boundary; the slice genus of a knot\nK is bounded from below by the minimal genus for a specific homology class in\nthe 4-manifold obtained by attaching a 2-handle to the 4-ball along K. It follows\nthat Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 1.2 give lower bounds of the slice genus in terms\nof the \u03c1-invariants. In fact, it turns out that this method gives us lower bounds\nof the genus of a locally flat surface bounded by K in a homology 4-ball with\nboundary S 3 . The following theorem illustrates that our lower bounds from the\n\u03c1-invariants actually reveal new information; one can detect arbitrarily large slice\ngenus of knots that all the previously known lower bounds fail to detect.\nTheorem 1.3. For any positive integer g, there are infinitely many knots K with\nthe following properties:\n(1) g\u2217t (K) = g\u2217s (K) = g.\n(2) K has a Seifert matrix of a slice knot.\n(3) K has vanishing Casson-Gordon invariants.\n(4) K has vanishing Ozsv\u00e1th-Szab\u00f3 \u03c4 -invariant and Rasmussen s-invariant.\nWe remark that in the proof of Theorem 1.3 (1), g\u2217t (K) is detected by considering\na minimal genus problem for which the results in [HS71, Rok71, LW97, LW00] give\nno interesting lower bound but the \u03c1-invariants give an optimal bound. We also\nremark that results of Cochran-Orr-Teichner [COT03] can be used to reveal partial\ninformation that g\u2217t (K) > 0, i.e., K is not topologically slice.\nAs a consequence of Theorem 1.3 (4), it follows that the applications of the\nadjunction inequality to the smooth slice genus as in [Rud97, LM97, LM98, AM97]\ngive us no information on K, since \u03c4 - and s-invariants are known to be sharper than\nthe Thurston-Bennequin lower bound, due to Plamenevskaya [Pla04a, Pla04b] and\nShumakovitch [Shu04]. The author knows no other method to apply gauge theory\nto estimate the slice genus of our K. Finally we remark that in the proof of\nTheorem 1.3 (4), we show a little more generalized statement (Lemma 5.4) that for\nany finitely collection {\u03a6\u03b1 } of integer-valued homomorphisms of the smooth knot\nconcordance group that give lower bounds of g\u2217s , our K can be chosen in such a way\nthat \u03a6\u03b1 (K) = 0 for each \u03a6\u03b1 , i.e., no such homomorphism extracts any information\non the slice genus of K. For more detailed discussion on Theorem 1.3, see Section 5.\n\n\f4\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\n2. Betti numbers and L2 -signatures\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.1 (1). The essential part of the proof is\nto estimate the L2 -Betti number of a 4-manifold in terms of the ordinary Betti\nnumber. From this the desired relationship between the ordinary Betti number\nand the L2 -signature follows, because L2 -dimension theory enables us to show that\nthe L2 -signature is bounded by the (middle dimensional) L2 -Betti number; this is\nan L2 -analogue of a well-known fact that the ordinary signature is bounded by the\nBetti number. In this section all manifolds are topological manifolds.\nUpper bounds of L2 -Betti numbers. We start by defining the algebraic L2 Betti number. As a primary reference on the L2 -theory we need, we refer to L\u00fcck's\nbook [L\u00fcc02]. Let \u0393 be a discrete countable group. While L2 -invariants are usually\ndefined via the group von Neumann algebra N \u0393, in this paper we will mainly use\nthe algebra U\u0393 of operators affiliated to N \u0393, which is more useful for our purpose.\nBoth coefficients are known to give the same L2 -Betti number and signature.\nThe L2 -dimension theory provides a dimension function\n(2)\n\ndim\u0393 : {finitely generated U\u0393-modules} \u2212\u2192 [0, \u221e).\nFor a finite CW-complex X endowed with \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393, the twisted homology module\nHi (X; U\u0393) = Hi (C\u2217 (X; Z\u0393) \u2297Z\u0393 U\u0393)\nis defined by viewing U\u0393 as a Q\u0393-module via the natural inclusions Q\u0393 \u2192 N \u0393 \u2192\n(2)\nU\u0393, and is known to be finitely generated. The L2 -Betti number \u03b2i (X) is defined\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nto be \u03b2i (X) = dim\u0393 Hi (X; U\u0393). For a CW-pair (X, A), \u03b2i (X, A) is similarly\ndefined. (In this paper the choice of \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393 will always be clearly understood\nand so we do not include it in the notation.) It is known that the analytic and\nL2 -homological definitions are equivalent to the algebraic definition described here\n[L\u00fcc02, Chapter 1, 6 and 8].\nFollowing Cochran-Orr-Teichner [COT03], we will focus on the case of a polytorsion-free-abelian (PTFA) group, which is defined to be a group admitting a\nfinite length normal series {Gi } with torsion-free abelian quotients Gi /Gi+1 . In\nthis paper \u0393 is always assumed to be PTFA. Also, we assume that \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393\nis nontrivial, since a trivial homomorphism gives nothing beyond the (untwisted)\nrational coefficient.\nProposition 2.1.

For a proof of Lemma 2.3, see [COT03].\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n5\n\nLemma 2.3.\n(1) Q\u0393 is an Ore domain so that there is a (skew-)field K of\nright quotients of Q\u0393. Every K-module M is free and has a well-defined\ndimension dimK M .\n(2) Suppose that C\u2217 is a finitely generated free chain complex over Q\u0393. If\nHi (C\u2217 \u2297Q\u0393 Q) = 0 for i \u2264 n, then Hi (C\u2217 \u2297Q\u0393 K) = 0 for i \u2264 n.\nIn particular, the existence of the skew-field K of quotients enables us to understand the L2 -dimension as the ordinary dimension over K, as follows: it is known\nthat if Q\u0393 is an Ore domain, then the natural map Q\u0393 \u2192 U\u0393 extends to an embedding K \u2192 U\u0393 [L\u00fcc02]. For a space X equipped with \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393, let denote\nthe Betti number with K-coefficients by \u03b2i (X; K) = dimK Hi (X; K). By definition,\nHi (X; U\u0393) is the homology of the cellular chain complex\nC\u2217 (X; Q\u0393) \u2297Q\u0393 U\u0393 = (C\u2217 (X; Q\u0393) \u2297Q\u0393 K) \u2297K U\u0393.\nSince H\u2217 (X; K) = H\u2217 (C\u2217 (X; Q\u0393) \u2297Q\u0393 K), we have the universal coefficient spectral\nsequence\n2\nEp,q\n= TorK\np (Hq (X; K), U\u0393) \u21d2 Hp+q (X; U\u0393).\nSince all higher Tor terms vanish over the K-coefficient, it follows that\nHi (X; U\u0393) = Hi (X; K) \u2297K U\u0393.\nTherefore Hi (X; U\u0393) is always a free U\u0393-module whose U\u0393-rank is equal to the\n(2)\nK-coefficient Betti number \u03b2i (X; K). Since dim\u0393 (U\u0393)n = n (e.g., see [L\u00fcc02]), we\nobtain\n(2)\n\nLemma 2.4. \u03b2i (X) = \u03b2i (X; K), and similarly for a pair (X, A).\nIn order to prove Proposition 2.1, we first deal with the first Betti number.\nLemma 2.5. Suppose (X, A) is a finite CW-pair with X connected, and \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393\nis a homomorphism. Then\n(1) If A is nonempty, \u03b21 (X, A; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (X, A).\n(2) If A is empty, \u03b21 (X; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (X) \u2212 1.\nWe remark that the absolute case (2) was shown in [COT03, Proposition 2.11].\nProof. Suppose that A is nonempty. Denote \u03b2 = \u03b21 (X, A), and let (Y, B) be the\ndisjoint union of \u03b2 copies of (I, \u2202I) where I = [0, 1]. Choose a map f : (Y, B) \u2192\n(X, A) which induced an isomorphism H1 (Y, B; Q) \u2192 H1 (X, A; Q).\nBy replacing X with the mapping cylinder Mf = (Y \u00d7 I) \u222a X/(y, 0) \u223c f (x) of\nf , and replacing A with (B \u00d7 I) \u222a A \u2282 Mf , we may assume that f is an injection\n(Y, B) \u2282 (X, A) and Y \u2229 A = B. From the homology long exact sequence with\nQ-coefficients derived from\n0 \u2212\u2192 C\u2217 (Y, B) \u2212\u2192 C\u2217 (X, A) \u2212\u2192 C\u2217 (X, Y \u222a A) \u2212\u2192 0,\nit follows that Hi (X, Y \u222a A; Q) = 0 for i \u2264 1. By Lemma 2.3 (2), Hi (X, Y \u222a\nA; K) = 0 for i \u2264 1. Thus, from the long exact sequence with K-coefficients, it\nfollows that f induces a surjection H1 (Y, B; K) \u2192 H1 (X, A; K). This shows that\n\u03b21 (X, A; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (Y, B; K). On the other hand, since Ci (Y, B; K) = 0 for all i but\nC1 (Y, B; K) = K\u03b2 , \u03b21 (Y, B; K) = \u03b2. This completes the proof of (1).\nSuppose A is empty. To apply the previous case, we choose a point \u2217 \u2208 X and\nconsider the pair (X, {\u2217}). In the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 H1 (X; K) \u2212\u2192 H1 (X, {\u2217}; K) \u2212\u2192 H0 ({\u2217}; K) \u2212\u2192 H1 (X; K),\nH0 ({\u2217}; K) = K obviously and H0 (X; K) = K/(\u03c01 (X)-action) is trivial since K is a\ndivision ring and \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u0393 is nontrivial. It follows that\n\u03b21 (X; K) + 1 = \u03b21 (X, {\u2217}; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (X, {\u2217}) = \u03b21 (X).\n\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nProof of Proposition 2.1. Suppose W is a compact connected 4-manifold equipped\nwith \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393. Since W has the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex with\ncells of dimension \u2264 4, we may assume that the chain complex C\u2217 (W ; \u2212) is finitely\ngenerated and has dimension \u2264 4.\n(2)\nBy Lemma 2.4, we can think of \u03b2i (W ; K) instead \u03b2i (W ). So (1) follows directly\nfrom Lemma 2.5.\nTo prove (3), observe that the duality implies \u03b23 (W ; K) = \u03b21 (W, \u2202W ; K). If\n\u2202W is empty, \u03b21 (W, \u2202W ; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (W ) \u2212 1 = \u03b23 (W ) \u2212 1 by Lemma 2.5. If \u2202W is\nnonempty, \u03b21 (W, \u2202W ; K) \u2264 \u03b21 (W, \u2202W ) = \u03b23 (W ) again by Lemma 2.5.\nTo prove (2), we use the fact that the Euler characteristics for the Q- and Kcoefficients are the same, that is,\n4\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03b2i (W ; K) =\n\n4\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03b2i (W ).\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nSince \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393 is nontrivial, \u03b20 (W ; K) = 0. When W has nonempty boundary,\n\u03b20 (W, \u2202W ; K) = 0 since \u03b20 (W, \u2202W ; K) \u2264 \u03b20 (W ; K). From this it follows that\n\u03b24 (W ; K) = 0. Plugging these values and the inequalities proved above into the\nEuler characteristic identity, we obtain \u03b22 (W ; K) \u2264 \u03b22 (W ).\n\u0003\nUpper bounds of L2 -signatures. We define the von Neumann L2 -signature as\nfollows: for a 4k-manifold W endowed with \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393, the U\u0393-coefficient intersection form\n\u03bb : H2k (W ; U\u0393) \u00d7 H2k (W ; U\u0393) \u2212\u2192 U\u0393\nis a hermitian form. In our case, H2k (W ; U\u0393) is always a free U\u0393-module since\n\u0393 is assumed to be PTFA. By spectral theory, H2k (W ; U\u0393) is decomposed as an\northogonal sum of canonically defined subspaces H+ , H\u2212 , and H0 such that \u03bb is\npositive definite, negative definite, and trivial, on H+ , H\u2212 , and H0 , respectively.\nThe L2 -signature of W is defined to be\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nsign(2) (W ) = dim\u0393 (H+ ) \u2212 dim\u0393 (H\u2212 ) \u2208 R.\nFor more details and the relationship with other ways to define the L2 -signature,\nrefer to [COT03] and [LS03].\n(2)\n\nLemma 2.6. | sign(2) (W )| \u2264 \u03b22k (W ).\nProof. Since H+ , H\u2212 \u2282 H2k (W ; U\u0393) and H+ \u2229 H\u2212 = {0}, L2 -dimension theory\nenables us to show\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\ndim\u0393 (H+ ) + dim\u0393 (H\u2212 ) \u2264 dim\u0393 H2k (W ; U\u0393)\nusing an L2 -analogue of a standard argument of elementary linear algebra. (e.g.,\n(2)\nrefer to Chapter 8 of [L\u00fcc02], where it is shown that dim\u0393 satisfies a set of axioms\nwhich includes all the properties we need.) From this the conclusion follows.\n\u0003\nCombining Lemma 2.6 with Lemma 2.1, we obtain:\nLemma 2.7. If W is a compact connected 4-manifold endowed with a nontrivial\nhomomorphism \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393, then\n| sign(2) (W )| \u2264 \u03b22 (W ).\nNow we are ready to show the first part of Theorem 1.1 stated in the introduction. We adopt the following topological definition of the \u03c1-invariant, as in\nChang-Weinberger [CW03]. (See also Cochran-Orr-Teichner [COT03].) Let M\nbe a 3-manifold endowed with \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u0393. It is known that there is a bigger\ngroup G containing \u0393 and a 4-manifold W such that \u2202W consists of r components\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n7\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2192 \u0393 \u2192 G factors through \u03c01 (W )\nM1 , . . . , Mr (r > 0), Mi \u223c\n= M , and \u03c01 (Mi ) \u2212\nfor each i. (For a proof, see the appendix of [CW03]; they consider the case that\n\u03c01 (M ) = \u0393 but the same argument works in our case as well.) Then \u03c1(M, \u03c6) is\ndefined to be the following signature defect:\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c1(M, \u03c6) =\nsign(2) (W ) \u2212 sign(W ) \u2208 R\nr\n(2)\nwhere sign (W ) and sign(W ) denote the L2 -signature associated to \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 G\nand the ordinary signature, respectively. The real number \u03c1(M, \u03c6) is determined\nby M and \u03c6, and independent of the choices we made. From the results in [LS03]\nit follows that \u03c1(M, \u03c6) defined above coincides with the \u03c1-invariant of CheegerGromov [CG85].\nProof of Theorem 1.1 (1). Suppose W is a compact connected 4-manifold with\nboundary M , and \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393 is given. Let denote the composition \u03c01 (M ) \u2192\n\u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393 by \u03c6. Our goal is to show that |\u03c1(M, \u03c6)| \u2264 2\u03b22 (W ).\nSince \u03c6 factors through \u03c01 (W ), we can compute \u03c1(M, \u03c6) using W ; by the definition above,\n\u03c1(M, \u03c6) = sign(2) (W ) \u2212 sign(W ).\nObviously | sign(W )| \u2264 \u03b22 (W ). By Lemma 2.7, | sign(2) (W )| \u2264 \u03b22 (W ). From this\nthe desired conclusion follows.\n\u0003\n3. Extending coefficient systems to bounding 4-manifolds\nSuppose W is a topological 4-manifold with boundary M and \u03c01 (W ) \u2192 \u0393 is\ngiven. (M is endowed with the induced map \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u0393.) In this section we deal\nwith the problem of extending a bigger coefficient system on M to W to prove\nTheorem 1.1 (2). To state a more detailed form of Theorem 1.1 (2), we need the\nfollowing facts from [COT03]: suppose R is a (possibly non-commutative) subring\nof K which is a PID containing Z\u0393. In this section we assume that H1 (M ; R) is\nR-torsion.\n(1) Blanchfield form on H1 (M ; R).

We also recall that, as in case of a commutative PID, any finitely\ngenerated R-module M is isomorphic to F \u2295 tM where F is a free module of rank\ndimK (M \u2297R K) and tM is the R-torsion submodule of M . (e.g., refer to [Coh71].)\ntM is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic modules of nonzero order.\nNow we can state the result we will prove in this section. Denote by \u2202 the\nboundary map H2 (W, M ; R) \u2192 H1 (M ; R).\nTheorem 3.1. Suppose that H2 (W, M ; R) = F \u2295 tH2 (W, M ; R) and \u2202(F ) is a\nproper submodule of H1 (M ; R) for some free summand F . Then there is a nontrivial\nsubmodule P in H1 (M ; R) such that for any x \u2208 P , the homomorphism\nBl(x) : H1 (M ; R) \u2212\u2192 K/R\nfactors through H1 (W ; R).\nIn particular, if H1 (M ; R) is never generated by \u03b22 (W ) elements, then since\n(2)\n\n\u03b22 (W, M ; K) = \u03b22 (W ; K) = \u03b22 (W ) \u2264 \u03b22 (W )\nby duality and Lemma 2.1, the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied. It it is the\ncase, then for x \u2208 P , Bl(x) gives rise to a homomorphism \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 K/R\u22ca\u0393 which\nfactors through \u03c01 (W ). This proves Theorem 1.1 (2).\nThe remaining part of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 3.1. As\nthe first step, we will show that for the boundary of a relative 2-cycle of (W, M ),\nthe Blanchfield form of M can be computed via the intersection form of W . Indeed\nit is a consequence of the following algebraic observation:\nLemma 3.2.

Suppose z is a cycle in Cn\u2032\u2032 , and x \u2208 Cn is a pre-image of z, i.e., p(x) = z.\nHj (C\u2217\u2032 ) \u2297 K = Hj (C\u2217\u2032 \u2297 K) = 0 for j = n, n \u2212 1 since K is a flat R-module, and\ntherefore p induces an isomorphism Hn (C\u2217 ) \u2297 K \u223c\n= Hn (C\u2217\u2032\u2032 ) \u2297 K. It follows that\nthere is a cycle y in Cn such that p\u2217 [y] = [z] * r in Hn (C\u2217\u2032\u2032 ) for some nonzero r \u2208 R,\nthat is, there is u \u2208 Cn+1 such that \u2202u = x * r \u2212 y + w where w \u2208 Cn\u2032 \u2282 Cn .

On the other hand,\nby the definition of the Bockstein homomorphism, B[w \u2297 r1 ] = [\u2202x], and therefore,\n\u03b2[z] = [w \u2297 r1 ].\nIn Cn \u2297 K/R, we have\n\u0010\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\u0011\n= x \u2212 y \u2297 + w \u2297 = \u2212y \u2297 + w \u2297 .\n\u2202 u\u2297\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n9\n\nFrom this it follows that [y \u2297 r1 ] = [w \u2297 r1 ] in Hn (C\u2217 \u2297 K/R).\n\n\u0003\n\nRecall that \u2202 denotes the boundary map H2 (W, M ; R) \u2192 H1 (M ; R).\nLemma 3.3.

From this the conclusion follows.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.1. For a submodule P in H1 (M ; R), we denote\nP \u22a5 = {y \u2208 H1 (M ; R) | Bl(x)(y) = 0 for all x \u2208 P }.\nConsider the exact sequence\n\u2202\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 H2 (W ; R) \u2212\u2192 H2 (W, M ; R) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M ; R) \u2212\u2192 H1 (W ; R) \u2212\u2192 * * * .\nWe will show that there is a nontrivial submodule P in H1 (M ; R) such that the\nimage \u2202(H2 (W, M ; R)) is contained in P \u22a5 . Indeed from this claim it follows\nthat, for any x \u2208 P , Bl(x) : H1 (M ; R) \u2192 K/R gives rise to a homomorphism\nCoker \u2202 \u2192 K/R, which automatically extends to H1 (W ; R) since K/R is an injective R-module. This completes the proof.\nRecall that we wrote H2 (W, M ; R) = F \u2295 tH2 (W, M ; R) where F is free and\ntH2 (W, M ; R) is the torsion submodule. To prove the claim, we consider the following two cases:\nCase 1: Suppose \u2202(tH2 (W, M ; R)) is nontrivial. Consider the composition \u03a6\ndescribed in Lemma 3.3. For any x \u2208 tH2 (W, M ; R) we have \u03a6(x) = 0, since\n\u03a6 factors through H2 (W, M ; K) which is torsion free. Therefore Bl(\u2202x)(\u2202y) =\n\u03a6(x)(y) = 0 for any y \u2208 H2 (W, M ; R). This shows that P = \u2202(tH2 (W, M ; R)) is a\nnontrivial submodule satisfying the desired property.\nCase 2: Suppose \u2202(tH2 (W, M ; R)) is trivial. Then the image of \u2202 is equal to\n\u2202(F ), which is a proper submodule of H1 (M ; R) by the hypothesis. Appealing to\nthe lemma below, which should be regarded as folklore, it follows that P = \u2202(F )\u22a5\nis nontrivial. It is obvious that this P has the desired property.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nLemma 3.4. Suppose A is a finitely generated torsion R-module endowed with a\nsymmetric linking form given by an isomorphism \u03a8 : A \u2192 Hom(A, K/R). Then for\nany proper submodule B in A, B \u22a5 is nontrivial.\nProof. From the exact sequence\np#\n\ni#\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Hom(A/B, K/R) \u2212\u2192 Hom(A, K/R) \u2212\u2192 Hom(B, K/R)\nit follows that B \u22a5 = \u03a8\u22121 (Ker i# ) = \u03a8\u22121 (Im p# ). So it suffices to show that\nHom(A/B, K/R) is nontrivial. Note that every cyclic module R/pR with p 6= 0 is\n(isomorphic to) a submodule of K/R . Since A/B is a nontrivial torsion module, it\nhas a summand of the form R/pR with p 6= 0, by the structure theorem of finitely\ngenerated R-modules. It follows that Hom(A/B, K/R) is nontrivial.\n\u0003\n4. Construction of a bordism from a locally flat surface\nIn this section we will prove Proposition 1.2. Suppose W is a topological 4manifold with boundary M such that H1 (W ) = 0, and \u03c3 is a 2-dimensional homology class contained in Im{H2 (M ) \u2192 H2 (W )}. First we describe a homomorphism\n\u03c6\u03c3 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 Z which is determined by \u03c3. Consider the exact sequence\n\u2202\n\nH2 (W ) \u2212\u2192 H2 (W, M ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (W ) = 0.\nThe intersection with \u03c3 gives a homomorphism \u03c3* : H2 (W, M ) \u2192 Z, which induces\na homomorphism h\u03c3 : H1 (M ) \u2192 Z since \u03c3* vanishes on the image of H2 (W ). Define\n\u03c6\u03c3 to be the composition\nh\n\n\u03c3\nZ.\n\u03c6\u03c3 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M ) \u2212\u2192\n\nRecall that Proposition 1.2 claims that if there is a locally flat surface \u03a3 of genus g\nin W which represents the class \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (W ) and the map \u03c6\u03c3 is nontrivial, then there\nis a topological 4-manifold V bounded by M such that \u03b22 (V ) = \u03b22 (W ) + 2g \u2212 1 and\n\u03c6\u03c3 factors through H1 (V ). Roughly speaking, we will construct V by performing\n\"surgery along \u03a3\" on W .\nProof of Proposition 1.2. By Alexander duality, H2 (W, W \u2212 \u03a3) can be identified\nwith H 2 (\u03a3) = Z. From the exact sequence\n\u03c3*\n\nH2 (W ) \u2212\u2192 H2 (W, W \u2212 \u03a3) \u2212\u2192 H1 (W \u2212 \u03a3) \u2212\u2192 H1 (W ) = 0\n\u223c H2 (W, W \u2212 \u03a3) = Z since the leftmost map \u03c3* is given\nit follows that H1 (W \u2212 \u03a3) =\nby the intersection of a 2-cycle with \u03c3, which is always zero.\nNote that \u03a3 has trivial normal bundle in W since \u03a3 is connected and the selfintersection \u03c3 * \u03c3 vanishes. There is a bijection between the set of (fiber homotopy\nclasses of) framings on \u03a3 and [\u03a3, S 1 ] = H 1 (\u03a3, Z) which can be identified with Z2g by\nchoosing a basis {xi } of H1 (\u03a3). Pushoff along a framing induces a homomorphism\nH1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (W \u2212 \u03a3) in such a way that if the framing corresponding to 0 \u2208 Z2g\ninduces h : H1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (W \u2212 \u03a3), then the framing corresponding to (ai ) \u2208 Z2g\ngives rise to a homomorphism sending xi to h(xi ) + ai [\u03bc] where \u03bc is a meridional\ncurve of \u03a3. Since H1 (W \u2212 M ) \u223c\n= Z is generated by [\u03bc], it follows that there is\na framing inducing a trivial homomorphism H1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (W \u2212 \u03a3). We identify\na tubular neighborhood of \u03a3 in W with \u03a3 \u00d7 D2 under this framing, and denote\nN = W \u2212 int(\u03a3 \u00d7 D2 ).\nChoose a 3-manifold R with boundary \u03a3 such that H1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (R) is surjective\n(e.g., a handlebody with the same genus as \u03a3 may be used as R). Let\n\u0001\nV = N \u222a (R \u00d7 S 1 ) / \u223c\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n11\n\nwhere \u03a3 \u00d7 S 1 \u2282 \u2202N and \u2202R \u00d7 S 1 are identified. From the Mayer-Vietoris sequence\n* * * \u2212\u2192 H1 (\u03a3 \u00d7 S 1 ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (N ) \u2295 H1 (R \u00d7 S 1 ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (V ) \u2212\u2192 0\nfor V = N \u222a (R \u00d7 S 1 ), it follows that H1 (V ) \u223c\n= H1 (N ) = Z since H1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (R)\nis surjective and i\u2217 : H1 (\u03a3) \u2192 H1 (N ) is trivial by our choice of the framing on \u03a3.\nFrom the definition it is easily seen that h\u03c3 is equal to the map H1 (M ) \u2192 H1 (V ) =\nZ induced by the inclusion. Therefore \u03c6\u03c3 factors through \u03c01 (V ) as desired.\nThe Betti number assertion follows from a straightforward computation. For the\nconvenience of the reader, we give details below. From the above Mayer-Vietoris\nsequence it follows that\n\u03c7(\u03a3 \u00d7 S 1 ) + \u03c7(V ) = \u03c7(N ) + \u03c7(R \u00d7 S 1 )\nwhere \u03c7 denotes the Euler characteristic. \u03c7(N ) + \u03c7(\u03a3) = \u03c7(W ) by the long exact\nsequence for the pair (W, N ) and Alexander duality. Since \u03c7(X \u00d7 S 1 ) = 0 for any\nX, it follows that\n\u03c7(V ) = \u03c7(W ) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03a3) = \u03c7(W ) + 2g \u2212 2.\nFrom the hypothesis that H1 (W ) = 0, it follows that \u03b21 (W ) = 0 and \u03b23 (W ) =\n\u03b21 (W, M ) = \u03b20 (M ) \u2212 1. \u03b21 (V ) = 1 as shown above. Since \u03c6\u03c3 is nontrivial, so\nis H1 (M ) \u2192 H1 (V ) = Z and thus has torsion cokernel. It follows that \u03b23 (V ) =\n\u03b21 (V, M ) = \u03b20 (M ) \u2212 1. Combining these observations on the Betti numbers with\nthe Euler characteristic identity, the desired inequality follows.\n\u0003\n5. Slice genus\nIn this section we apply the results proved in the previous sections to investigate\nthe slice genus of a knot K in S 3 . Indeed our results give lower bounds of the genus\nof a spanning surface in a homology 4-ball; for a knot K in a homology 3-sphere Y\nwhich bounds some (topological) homology 4-ball, let g\u2217h (K) be the minimal genus\nof a locally flat surface F in a homology 4-ball X such that \u2202(X, F ) = (Y, K).\nObviously g\u2217h (K) \u2264 g\u2217t (K) \u2264 g\u2217s (K) for a knot K in S 3 .\nFor (X, F ) as above, consider the 4-manifold W obtained by attaching a 2handle to X along the preferred framing of K. The boundary of W is the result of\nsurgery on Y along the preferred framing of K, which we will call the zero-surgery\nmanifold of K and denote by MK . Note that H1 (MK ) = Z is generated by a\nmeridian of K. Let \u03c3 be a generator of H2 (W ) = Z. It can be easily seen that the\nabelianization map \u03c6 : \u03c01 (MK ) \u2192 H1 (MK ) = Z is exactly the homomorphism \u03c6\u03c3\ndefined in Section 4. Also, note that \u03c3 is represented by a surface in MK , namely\na capped-off Seifert surface of K.\nAttaching to F the core of the 2-handle of W , we obtain a surface \u03a3 with the\nsame genus as F which represents the homology class \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (W ). Therefore, by\nProposition 1.2, one obtains a null-bordism of MK over Z with bounded \u03b22 ; we\nstate it as a proposition.\nProposition 5.1. There is a topological 4-manifold V with boundary MK such that\n\u03c6 : \u03c01 (MK ) \u2192 Z factors through \u03c01 (V ) and \u03b22 (V ) \u2264 2g\u2217h (K). In particular, if K\nis a knot in S 3 , then \u03b22 (V ) \u2264 2g\u2217t (K).\nThis enables us to use Theorem 1.1, possibly repeatedly, to obtain lower bounds\nof g\u2217h (K). We remark that while a lower bound is obtained from \u03c1(MK , \u03c6) by\napplying Theorem 1.1 (1) directly, it gives us no interesting result since it is known\nthat \u03c1(MK , \u03c6) is determined by the signature function of K [COT03]. However, it\nturns out that the \u03c1-invariants associated to bigger coefficient systems obtained by\nTheorem 1.1 (2) actually reveal new information on the slice genus which cannot\nbe obtained via previously known invariants, as mentioned in Theorem 1.3. The\n\n\f12\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nremaining part of this section is devoted to the construction of examples illustrating\nthis.\nConstruction of examples. Our examples will be constructed using a well known\nmethod that produces a new knot from a given knot by \"tying\" another knot along\na circle in the complement. For a knot J, we denote its exterior by EJ = S 3 \u2212 (open\ntubular neighborhood of J). Suppose K0 is a knot and \u03b7 is a circle in S 3 \u2212K0 which\nis unknotted in S 3 . Choose a (closed) tubular neighborhood U of \u03b7 in S 3 \u2212 K0 .\nRemoving the interior of U from S 3 \u2212 K0 and attaching the exterior EJ of a knot\nJ along the boundary of U in such a way that a meridional curve of \u03b7 is identified\nwith a curve null-homologous in EJ , one obtains the complement of a new knot in\nS 3 , which we will denote by K0 (\u03b7, J). In some literature this construction is called\nthe \"satellite construction\" or \"genetic infection\".\nWe start by choosing a knot Ks in S 3 whose Alexander polynomial \u2206Ks (t) is\na cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6n (t) with n divisible by at least three distinct primes.\nIndeed, by a well-known characterization due to Levine, there is such a knot if\nand only if \u03a6n (t\u22121 ) = \u00b1ts \u03a6n (t) for some s and \u03a6n (1) = \u00b11. Since the complex\nconjugate of a root of unity is its reciprocal, \u03a6n (t) satisfies the former condition.\nFor the latter condition, one may appeal to the following lemma:\nLemma 5.2. For n \u2265 2, \u03a6n (1) = 1 if and only if n is not a prime power.\nProof. If n = pa is a prime power, then it is easily seen that \u03a6n (t) is given by\na\u22121\n\n\u03a6n (t) = tp\n\n(p\u22121)\n\na\u22121\n\n+ * * * tp\n\n+1\n\nand therefore \u03a6n (1) = p.\nConversely, suppose n = pa1 1 * * * par r with pi prime and r > 1. We recall that\nY\n\u03a6d (t).\ntn \u2212 1 =\nd|n\n\nBy eliminating the factor of t \u2212 1 and rearranging terms, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012Y\nai\nr Y\nn\u22121\n\u03a6pj (t) * \u03a6n (t) * h(t)\nt\n+ ***+ t + 1 =\ni\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nPlugging t = 1, it follows that \u03a6n (1)h(1) = 1 and so \u03a6n (1) = 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u22121\n\nDenote the (rational) Alexander module H1 (MJ ; Q[t, t ]) of a knot J by AJ ,\nand the mirror image of J by \u2212J. (Here we adopt the standard convention of the\norientation of \u2212J so that J#(\u2212J) is always a ribbon knot.)\nReturning to our construction, for an unknotted circle in \u03b7 disjoint to Ks and\ntwo knots J and J \u2032 which will be chosen later, consider the connected sum\ng\n\u0001\nK = # Ks (\u03b7, J)# \u2212 (Ks (\u03b7, J \u2032 ))\n\nof g identical knots.\nWe choose \u03b7 in such a way that the following properties are satisfied:\n(P1) The linking number of \u03b7 and Ks vanishes, so that \u03b7 represents a homology\nclass [\u03b7] \u2208 AKs . Furthermore, [\u03b7] is a generator of AKs .\n(P2) For any J and J \u2032 , K satisfies g\u2217s (K) \u2264 g.\n(P3) For any J and J \u2032 , K is algebraically slice, i.e., K has a Seifert matrix of a\nslice knot.\n(P4) For any J and J \u2032 , K has vanishing Casson-Gordon invariants.\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n13\n\nFor this purpose, we first choose a Seifert surface F of Ks . F consists of one\n0-handle and 2r 1-handles, where r is the genus of F . Choose unknotted circles\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b32r in S 3 \u2212 F which are Alexander dual to the 1-handles of F , as illustrated\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\nSince each \u03b3i is disjoint to F , it represents a homology class [\u03b3i ] \u2208 AKs . Also,\nit can be seen that the [\u03b3i ] generate AKs , by a standard Mayer-Vietoris argument.\nTherefore one of the [\u03b3i ], say [\u03b31 ], is nontrivial in AKs . Let \u03b7 be \u03b31 .\nLemma 5.3. \u03b7 satisfies the properties (P1)\u2013(P4) required above.\nProof. Obviously \u03b7 has linking number zero with K. Since \u2206Ks (t) is irreducible,\nAKs = Q[t, t\u22121 ]/h\u2206Ks (t)i, and [\u03b7] 6= 0 is automatically a generator of AKs . This\nshows (P1).\nLet L = Ks (\u03b7, J)# \u2212 (Ks (\u03b7, J \u2032 )). We claim that g\u2217s (L) \u2264 1, from which (2)\neasily follows. To prove the claim, observe that L is obtained from the ribbon knot\nKs #(\u2212Ks ), by \"tying\" J and J \u2032 . Note that the boundary connected sum of F\nand \u2212F is a Seifert surface for Ks #(\u2212Ks ). Tying J and J \u2032 , the Seifert surface of\nKs #(\u2212Ks ) becomes a Seifert surface E of genus 2r for L. E consists of a single\n0-handle and 4r 1-handles H1 , . . . , H4r , where Hi is the image of the H4r\u2212i+1 under\nan obvious reflection, for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 2r. Joining the endpoints of the core of Hi to their\nimage under the reflection using disjoint arcs on the 0-handle of E for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 2r,\nwe obtain (2r \u2212 1) disjoint circles \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b12r on E. See Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2.\nThe union of the \u03b1i is a smoothly slice link, being the connected sum of a\nlink and its mirror image. Thus there are disjoint 2-disks D1 , . . . , D2r\u22121 smoothly\nembedded in D4 such that \u2202Di = \u03b1i . Since the Seifert form defined on E vanishes\nat (\u03b1i , \u03b1j ), one can do ambient surgery on E along the \u03b1i , using the disks Di in D4 ,\nas in [Lev69]. This produces a genus one surface in D4 with boundary L. Therefore\ng\u2217s (L) \u2264 1. This completes the proof of (P2).\nSince L shares a Seifert matrix with Ks #(\u2212Ks ) which is a ribbon knot, L is\nalgebraically slice. From this (P3) follows.\nIt is easily seen that \u2206K (t) = \u03a6n (t)2g . Since n has been chosen to be divisible\nby three distinct primes, (P4) holds due to a result of Livingston [Liv02].\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nLet C be the smooth knot concordance group.\nLemma 5.4.

Then, there are\nknots J and J \u2032 such that our K satisfies the followings:\n(1) g\u2217h (K) = g\u2217t (K) = g\u2217s (K) = g.\n(2) \u03a6\u03b1 (K) = 0 for each \u03a6\u03b1 .\nNote that the Ozsv\u00e1th-Szab\u00f3 \u03c4 -invariant [OS03] and Rasmussen s-invariant\n[Ras04] can be viewed as homomorphisms of C giving lower bounds of g\u2217s . Therefore, from Lemma 5.4 (2), it follows that J and J \u2032 can be chosen in such a way that\nK has vanishing \u03c4 - and s-invariants.\nProof of Lemma 5.4. Let K \u2032 be the connected sum of g copies of Ks #(\u2212Ks ). By\nCheeger-Gromov [CG85], there is a universal bound C of the \u03c1-invariants of the\nzero-surgery manifold MK \u2032 of K \u2032 , i.e., |\u03c1(MK \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 )| \u2264 C for any homomorphism \u03c6\u2032\nof \u03c01 (MK \u2032 ).\nFollowing [COT04], for a knot J, let\nZ\n\u03c3J (\u03c9) d\u03c9\n\u03c1(J) =\nS1\n\nbe the integral of the knot signature function\n\n\u03c3J (\u03c9) = sign((1 \u2212 \u03c9)S + (1 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304)S T )\nover the unit circle S 1 normalized to unit length, where S is a Seifert matrix of J.\nWe claim that there are two knots J and J \u2032 such that\n(i) |\u03c1(J)| \u2265 C + 4g,\n(ii) |\u03c1(J \u2032 )| \u2265 C + 4g + g * |\u03c1(J)|, and\n(iii) \u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, J)) = \u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, J \u2032 )) for each \u03a6\u03b1 .\nTo prove the claim, we consider a sequence {Ji } of knots constructed inductively\nas follows. Let J0 be a knot with |\u03c1(J0 )| \u2265 C + 4g. Assuming Ji has been chosen,\nlet Ji+1 be a knot satisfying\n|\u03c1(Ji+1 )| \u2265 C + 4g + g * |\u03c1(Ji )|.\nFor example, one can choose as Ji the connected sum of sufficiently many copies\nof any knot with nonvanishing \u03c1, e.g., the trefoil knot, since \u03c1 is additive under\nconnected sum.\nSince\ng\u2217s (Ks (\u03b7, Ji )) \u2264 g(Ks (\u03b7, Ji )) \u2264 g(Ks )\nwhere g(\u2212) denotes\u0001 the 3-genus (Seifert genus),\nthere is an upper bound, say M\u03b1 ,\n\u0001\nof f\u03b1 g\u2217s (Ks (\u03b7, Ji )) , i.e., f\u03b1 g\u2217s (Ks (\u03b7, Ji )) \u2264 M\u03b1 for any Ji . Since\n\u0001\n|\u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, Ji ))| \u2264 f\u03b1 g\u2217s (Ks (\u03b7, Ji ))\nby our hypothesis, it follows that |\u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, Ji ))| is bounded by M\u03b1 . Therefore the\nfunction Z \u2192 Z|{\u03a6\u03b1 }| given by\ni \u2212\u2192 (\u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, Ji )))\u03b1\nhas finite image. It follows that for some i < j, \u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, Ji )) = \u03a6\u03b1 (Ks (\u03b7, Jj )) for\neach \u03a6\u03b1 . Choosing J = Ji and J \u2032 = Jj , the claim follows. (Indeed our argument\nshows that there are infinitely many pairs (J, J \u2032 ) satisfying the desired properties.)\nRecall that our K is given by\ng\n\u0001\nK = # Ks (\u03b7, J)# \u2212 (Ks (\u03b7, J \u2032 )) .\nBy (iii) above, \u03a6\u03b1 vanishes at Ks (\u03b7, J)# \u2212 (Ks (\u03b7, J \u2032 )). It follows that \u03a6\u03b1 (K) = 0\nfor each \u03a6\u03b1 . This proves the second conclusion of the lemma.\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL MINIMAL GENUS AND L2 -SIGNATURES\n\n15\n\nTo prove the first conclusion, it suffices to show that g\u2217h (K) \u2265 g by the property\n(P2) above. Suppose g\u2217h (K) < g. By Proposition 5.1, there is a 4-manifold V\nbounded by MK such that \u03b22 (V ) < 2g and \u03c6 : \u03c01 (MK ) \u2192 Z factors through \u03c01 (V ).\nLetting \u0393 = Z, R = Q[t, t\u22121 ], and K = Q(t), we will apply Theorem 1.1 (2) to\nobtain a new coefficient system \u03c61 which is a lift of \u03c6. The conditions required in\nTheorem 1.1 (2) are verified as follows. It is well-known that AK = H1 (MK ; R) is\nalways R-torsion. We claim that AK is not generated by \u03b22 (V ) elements. Since\nthe Alexander module is additive under connected sum and the knots Ks (\u03b7, J) and\nL2g\nKs (\u03b7, J \u2032 ) share the Alexander module with Ks , we have AK =\nAKs . Since\nAKs is nontrivial and \u03b22 (V ) < 2g, AK is never generated by \u03b22 (V ) elements as\nclaimed, by appealing to the structure theorem of finitely generated modules over\nQ[t, t\u22121 ].\nTherefore, by applying Theorem 1.1 (2) and then (1), it follows that there is a\nnontrivial homomorphism h : AK \u2192 K/R that gives rise to a homomorphism\n\u03c61 : \u03c01 (MK ) \u2212\u2192 (K/R) \u22ca \u0393\nsuch that\n(*)\n\n|\u03c1(MK , \u03c61 )| \u2264 2\u03b22 (V ) < 4g.\n\nNote that K can be viewed as a knot obtained from K \u2032 by tying J and \u2212J \u2032 g\ntimes. So, from [COT04, Proposition 3.2] it follows that for some \u03c6\u2032 : \u03c01 (MK \u2032 ) \u2192\n(K/R) \u22ca \u0393,\n\u03c1(MK , \u03c61 ) = \u03c1(MK \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) +\n\ng\nX\n\nni \u03c1(J) \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nL2g\n\ng\nX\n\nmi \u03c1(J \u2032 ).\n\ni=1\n\nHere ni = 0 if the (2i \u2212 1)-st factor of AK =\nAKs is contained in the kernel of\nh, and ni = 1 otherwise. The mi are determined similarly by the behaviour of the\n(2i)-th factor of AK .\nSince h is a nontrivial homomorphism of AK , at least one ni or mi is nonzero.\nIf mi = 0 for all i, then since ni 6= 0 for some i, we have\n|\u03c1(MK , \u03c61 )| \u2265 |\u03c1(J)| \u2212 |\u03c1(MK \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 )| \u2265 (4g + C) \u2212 C = 4g\nby (i) above. It contradicts (\u2217). Therefore mi 6= 0 for some i. In this case, by (ii)\nabove, we have\n|\u03c1(MK , \u03c61 )| \u2265 |\u03c1(J \u2032 )| \u2212 g * |\u03c1(J)| \u2212 |\u03c1(MK \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 )| \u2265 (4g + C) \u2212 C = 4g.\nIt again contradicts (\u2217). This shows that g\u2217h (K) \u2265 g.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.5. It can be easily seen that our construction produces infinitely many\nknot types of K. In fact, one can use infinitely many knot types as our Ks , J,\nand J \u2032 .\nRemark 5.6. Using results in [COT03], it can be shown that the nonvanishing\nof the \u03c1-invariants we considered in the proof of Lemma 5.4 implies that our K is\nnot topologically slice. Our result generalizes this. In fact, our construction can\nbe used to construct K which is (1)-solvable but not (1.5)-solvable, in the sense of\n[COT03]. It would be an interesting question whether there are (h)-solvable knots\nwith topological slice genus g for any h \u2208 12 Z and any g > 1.\nWe finish this section with an observation on the failure of an attempt to extract\ninformation on the minimal genus for our example using previously known results.\nIn [KM61, HS71, Rok71, LW97, LW00] lower bounds of the topological minimal\ngenus are obtained for a homology class \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (X) in a topological 4-manifold\nX which is closed or has boundary consisting of homology sphere components.\nWhen X is simply connected, [KM61] provides an obstruction to being represented\n\n\f16\n\nJAE CHOON CHA\n\nby a locally flat sphere, i.e., minimal genus \u2265 1, based on the Rokhlin theorem.\nWhen H1 (X) = 0, [HS71, Rok71, LW97, LW00] provides higher lower bounds of\nthe following form:\n2j(d \u2212 j)\n2 * (minimal genus) \u2265 \u2212\u03b22 (X) + max sign(X) \u2212\n(\u03c3 * \u03c3)\n0\u2264j<d\nd2\nwhere d is a positive integer such that \u03c3 is contained in the subgroup d * H2 (X).\n(A more refined result of Lee-Wilczy\u0144ski [LW00, Theorem 2.1] may potentially give\nfurther lower bounds, however, computation seems infeasible when H1 (X) 6= 0.)\nFor an arbitrary 4-manifold W with boundary and \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (W ), if W embeds\ninto a 4-manifold X such that the above inequality gives a lower bound for the\nimage of \u03c3 in X, then the result is also a lower bound for \u03c3 in W . However, when\nthe self-intersection of \u03c3 is trivial, the above inequality gives no information since\n\u03b22 (X) \u2265 | sign(X)| for any X. In particular, in the 4-manifold W obtained by\nattaching a 2-handle to the 4-ball along the zero-framing of the knot K constructed\nin this section, the generator \u03c3 \u2208 H2 (W ) has vanishing self-intersection so that the\nminimal genus is not detected in this way. Our results show that the minimal genus\nfor \u03c3 in W is exactly g.\nReferences\n[AM97]\n[CG78]\n\n[CG85]\n\n[CG86]\n\n[Coh71]\n[COT03]\n[COT04]\n[CW03]\n[Gil82]\n[HS71]\n\n[KM61]\n[KM93]\n[KM95a]\n[KM95b]\n[Kro99]\n[Lev69]\n[Liv02]\n[LM97]\n\nS.
