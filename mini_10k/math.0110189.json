Introduction\nIn this note we obtain precise asymptotics, as n \u2192 \u221e, for the expected number\nof distinct part sizes in a random composition of an integer n. Let us recall that\na multiset \u03bb = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk } is P\na partition of an integer n if the \u03bbj are positive\nintegers, called parts, such that\n\u03bbj = n. The values of \u03bbj 's are called part sizes.\nCompositions are partitions in which the order of parts is significant. Thus, for\nexample, the integer 3 admits three partitions, {1, 1, 1}, {2, 1} and {3}, and four\ncompositions, namely (1, 1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (3) According to our terminology\n(1, 2) is a composition of 3 in two parts with sizes 1 and 2. In analogy with random\npartitions, by a random composition of an integer n we mean a composition of n\nthat is chosen uniformly at random out of the set of all 2n\u22121 compositions of an\ninteger n. More formally, one considers the probability space consisting of the set\nC(n) of all compositions of n equipped with the uniform probability measure. In\nthis setting, the number of distinct part sizes (or other characteristics) becomes a\nrandom variable whose probabilistic behavior is to be studied.\nInvestigation of random partitions from this probabilistic perspective originated\nwith a paper by Erd\u00f6s and Lehner [5] who studied the limiting distribution of the\ntotal number of parts in a random partition. Subsequently, Wilf [11] found an asymptotic formula for the expected number of distinct part sizes. Goh and Schmutz\n[7] obtained more precise information on the distribution of the number of distinct\npart sizes, namely they established the central limit theorem. Recently Corteel,\nPittel, Savage and Wilf [3] obtained a refined version of Wilf's result concerning\nthe expectation of the number of distinct part sizes in a random partition. Their\nresult allows one to obtain as many terms for the asymptotic expansion of this\nexpectation as one wishes. For example, on \"o(1) level\" this expectation is\n\u221a\n6n\n1\n3\n+ 2 \u2212 + o(1).\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n2\nThe aim of this note is to obtain an asymptotics for the same quantity in the\ncase of random compositions. In order to state our result we need some notation.\nFor an integer n consider the set C(n) of all compositions \u03ba of n equipped with the\nuniform probability measure Pn = P (that is, P(\u03ba) = 2\u2212n+1 for every \u03ba \u2208 C(n).)\nPart of the research of the first author was carried out while he was visiting Department of\nMathematics of Lehigh University. He would like to thank the Department for its hospitality.\nTypeset by AMS-TEX\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFor a composition \u03ba = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k ) the number of distinct part sizes, Dn (\u03ba) is\ndefined by the formula\nDn (\u03ba) = 1 +\n\nk\nX\n\nI{\u03b3i 6=\u03b3j ,\n\nj=1,...,i\u22121} ,\n\ni=2\n\nwhere IA is the indicator function of the set A. We denote the integration with\nrespect to P on C(n) by E. We have:\nTheorem. As n \u2192 \u221e,\nEDn = log2 n +\n\n\u03b3\n3\n\u2212 + g(log2 n) + o(1),\nln 2 2\n\nwhere \u03b3 is Euler's constant and g is mean\u2013zero function of period 1 satisfying\n|g| \u2264 0.0000016.\nThus, the expected number of distinct part sizes in a composition of an integer n asymptotically behaves like log2 n plus a constant plus a small but periodic\noscillation. This oscillatory behavior, which just a few years ago was considered\nsurprising (to say the least) is by now a well documented and acknowledged feature\nof sequences of geometric random variables, see e.g. [2], [4], [8] [10].\nWe wish to observe that the asymptotics for the expected number of distinct\npart sizes is the same as the expected length of the longest run of heads in n tosses\nof a fair coin, see e.g. [2] or [8]. Since the size of the largest part is one plus the\nlongest run of heads it follows that on average one expects to see parts of all but\none sizes between 1 and the largest size (or runs of heads of all but one lengths\nbetween 1 and the longest run).\n2. outline of a proof\nQuite often results like this are obtained through careful analysis of the the generating function. We will use a different approach. We will view random composition\nas (essentially) randomly stopped sequence of i.i.d. geometric random variables\nand we will express the number of distinct part sizes as a function of this sequence.\nThis will allow for direct and straightforward estimates. The same approach was\nused successfully in [9] to handle a problem in which generating function approach\nwas apparently futile. We believe that this technique will prove useful in many\nother problems concerning random compositions. Our proof in a natural way splits\nin the two steps. In the first we will use the afore\u2013mentioned representation and\nprobabilistic estimates to extract the main contribution to EDn . Namely, we have\nProposition 1. As n \u2192 \u221e,\nEDn =\n\n\u221e n\nX\n1 \u0001 n (1+o(1) o\n+ o(1).\n1\u2212 1\u2212 m 2\n2\nm=1\n\nThe second, purely analytical step is to analyse the asymptotic behavior of the\ninfinite sum above. This goal could be accomplished by applying the so \u2013 called\nRice method (see e.g. [6] for a very good description and examples). Since this\nmethod requires some tools from complex analysis we decided to take a different\n\n\f3\n\nroute. As a result our analysis is completely elementary (thus, making this paper\nfully accessible to advanced undergraduates, for example.) To facilitate our analysis\nwe define\n\u221e n\nX\n1 \u00012x o\n1\u2212 1\u2212 m\n.\nf (x) =\n2\nm=1\nWith this definition we will show that f (x) tends to a limit as x tends to infinity\nalong sequences of the form {x0 + k}k\u2208Z , but does not possess a unrestricted limit\nas x \u2192 \u221e. More specifically, we have\nProposition 2. For large positive k\nf (x + k) = x + k + \u03b3/ ln 2 \u2212 1/2 + g(x) + o(2\u2212x\u2212k )\nwhere \u03b3 is Euler's constant and\ng(x) = \u2212x \u2212 \u03b3/ ln 2 + 1/2 \u2212\n\n0\nX\n\nexp(\u22122\u2212m+x ) +\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 exp(\u22122\u2212m+x ))\n\nm=1\n\nis a nonconstant, zero-mean function of period 1 satisfying | g(x) |\u2264 .0000016.\nClearly, Theorem follows by combining Propositions 1 and 2.\n3. proof of proposition 1\nCentral to our approach is the following proposition\nProposition 3. Let \u03931 , \u03932 . . . be i.i.d. geometric random variables with parameter\n1/2 (that is P(\u03931 = j) = 2\u2212j , j = 1, 2 . . . ) and define\n\u03c4 = inf{k \u2265 1 : \u03931 + \u03932 + * * * + \u0393k \u2265 n}.\nThen, the distribution of a randomly chosen composition in C(n) is given by\n(\u03931 , \u03932 , . . . , \u0393\u03c4 \u22121 , n \u2212\n\n\u03c4X\n\u22121\n\n\u0393j ).\n\nj=1\n\nThis proposition is nothing more than a reiteration of a known (see e.g. [1])\nconnection between compositions of integers and {0, 1} \u2013 valued sequences. Namely,\na composition \u03ba = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k ) of an integer n into parts \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k is associated\nwith a string of 0's and 1's of length n as follows: there is a 1 on the nth place\nand the numbers \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k are \"waiting times\" for the first, second,. . . , and kth\nappearance of 1. (For example, the composition (1, 2, 3, 1, 1) of 8 corresponds to the\nstring 10100111 while (4, 2, 2) corresponds to 00010101.) Choosing a composition at\nrandom amounts to having the 0's and 1's on the first n \u2212 1 places occur according\nto a binomial Bin(n \u2212 1, 1/2) law. We refer to [9] for more details. Let \u0393\u0303i (\u03ba) denote\nparts of a randomly chosen composition \u03ba, i.e.\n\u03c4 (\u03ba)\u22121\n\n\u0393\u0303i (\u03ba) = \u0393i (\u03ba),\n\nfor i < \u03c4 (\u03ba)\n\nand \u0393\u0303\u03c4 (\u03ba) (\u03ba) = n \u2212\n\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0393i (\u03ba).\n\n\f4\n\nNote that \u0393\u0303\u03c4 \u2264 \u0393\u03c4 .
