The\nproof depends on a similar stability property of the Sobolev inner\nproduct associated with the operator.\n\n1. Introduction. In [1], Kipnis and Varadhan proved an invariance principle for the position of a marked particle in a symmetric simple exclusion\nprocess in equilibrium. Their proof relies on a central limit theorem for additive functionals of a Markov process. Later, this result was generalized to\nthe mean zero simple exclusion process (see [8]) and the asymmetric simple\nexclusion process in dimension d \u2265 3 in [6].\nThe diffusion matrix of the limiting Brownian process is a function D(\u03b1)\nof the density of particles and is given by a variational formula.\nThe method of proof used by Kipnis and Varadhan works directly in\ninfinite systems and naturally raises the issue of the stability of the diffusion\ncoefficient under finite-dimensional approximations. More precisely, consider\na finite-dimensional version of the simple exclusion process on the torus\n{\u2212N, . . . , 0, . . . , N }d . In order to obtain an ergodic process, fix the total\nnumber K of particles. When N is sufficiently large, the motion of a tagged\nparticle on this finite system has a unique canonical lifting to Zd . In this\nmanner, we obtain a process XN (t) with values in Zd . Let DN,K denote the\nvariance of the limiting Brownian motion of the scaled process \u03b5XN (t/\u03b52 )\nwhen \u03b5 \u2192 0.

The proof presented there follows from a variational formula for\nthe diffusion coefficient that depends on the Sobolev dual norm associated\nwith the generator of the process and from a convergence result for the\nSobolev dual norms of the finite-dimensional approximations. Let h, g be\nlocal functions with mean zero with respect to all the Bernoulli product\nmeasures \u03bc\u03b1 that assign density \u03b1 to each coordinate. Denote by h*, *i\u03b1 the\ninner product on L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 ). Let \u03bcN,K be the uniform measure over the configurations with K particles on the torus {\u2212N, . . . , 0, . . . , N }d and h*, *i\u03bcN,K\nthe inner product on L2 (\u03bcN,K ). Let L (resp.

In Section 2, we present\nthe definition and basic properties of the simple exclusion process. In Section 3, we introduce the Sobolev spaces associated with the process and\nprove Theorem 2, a general perturbative result about the convergence of\nfinite approximations of a positive operator in Hilbert spaces. In Section 4,\nwe prove the stability of the diffusion coefficient for the tagged particle using\nthe Sobolev space techniques developed in Section 3. Finally, in Section 5,\nwe check the hypothesis of Theorem 2 for the simple exclusion process.\n2. Notation and results. Consider a probability measure p(*) of finite\nrange on Zd , that is, p(z) = 0 if |z| is sufficiently large. Suppose that p(0) = 0\nand that the random walk with transition rate p(*) is irreducible, that is,\nthe (finite) set {z; p(z) > 0} generates the group Zd . The simple exclusion\nprocess associated with p(*) corresponds to the Markov process defined on\nd\nX = {0, 1}Z , whose generator L0 acting on local functions f is given by\nL0 f (\u03b7) =\n\nX\n\np(y \u2212 x)\u03b7(x)(1 \u2212 \u03b7(y))[f (\u03c3 xy \u03b7) \u2212 f (\u03b7)].\n\nx,y\u2208Zd\n\nHere, \u03b7 \u2208 X denotes a configuration of particles in Zd . In particular,\n\u03b7(x) = 1 if there is a particle at the site x and \u03b7(x) = 0 otherwise, and\n\u03c3 xy \u03b7 is the configuration obtained from \u03b7 by exchanging the occupation\n\n\fSTABILITY OF THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT\n\n3\n\nnumbers at x and y:\nxy\n\n\u03c3 \u03b7(z) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03b7(y),\n\uf8f3\n\n\u03b7(x),\n\u03b7(z),\n\nif z = x,\nif z = y,\notherwise.\n\nIf p(z) = p(\u2212z) for all z, then the process willPbe called symmetric; if\nzp(z) = 0, it will be called of mean zero and if z\u2208Zd zp(z) = m 6= 0, the\nprocess will be called asymmetric.\nFor each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], let \u03bd\u03b1 denote the Bernoulli product measure in X ,\nthat is, the product measure such that \u03bd\u03b1 [\u03b7(x) = 1] = \u03b1 for each x \u2208 Zd . It is\nnot hard to prove that \u03bd\u03b1 is an invariant measure for the process generated\nby L0 .\nIn this model, particles are indistinguishable. In order to study the time\nevolution of a single particle, we proceed in the following way. Let \u03b7 \u2208 X be\nan initial state with a particle at the origin [i.e., \u03b7(0) = 1]. Tag this particle\nand let \u03b7t (resp. Xt ) be the time evolution of the exclusion process starting\nfrom \u03b7 (resp. the tagged particle starting from x = 0). Let \u03bet (x) = \u03b7t (x + Xt )\nbe the process as seen by the tagged particle. We call \u03bet the environment\nprocess.\nIt is clear that Xt is not a Markov process due to the interaction between\nthe tagged particle and the environment, but (\u03b7t , Xt ) and \u03bet are Markov\nd\nprocesses, the latter being defined in the state space X\u2217 = {0, 1}Z\u2217 , where\nZd\u2217 = Zd \\{0}. The generator of the process \u03bet , acting on local functions f , is\ngiven by L = L0 + L\u03c4 , where\nP\n\nL0 f (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\np(y \u2212 x)\u03be(x)(1 \u2212 \u03be(y))[f (\u03c3 xy \u03be) \u2212 f (\u03be)],\n\nx,y\u2208Zd\u2217\n\nL\u03c4 f (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\np(z)(1 \u2212 \u03be(z))[f (\u03c4z \u03be) \u2212 f (\u03be)].\n\nz\u2208Zd\u2217\n\nThe first part of the generator, L0 , takes into account the jumps of the\nenvironment (i.e., all particles but the tagged one), while the second part\ntakes into account the jumps of the tagged particle.\nIn this formula, \u03c4z \u03be is the configuration obtained by making the tagged\nparticle (at the origin) jump to site z and then bringing it back to the origin\nwith a translation:\n\u001a\n0,\nif x = \u2212z,\n\u03c4z \u03be(x) =\n\u03be(x + z),\nif x 6= \u2212z.\nFor the process \u03bet , we have a one-parameter family of invariant ergodic\nmeasures {\u03bc\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208[0,1] , where \u03bc\u03b1 is the Bernoulli product measure of density\n\u03b1 defined on X\u2217 : \u03bc\u03b1 [\u03be(x) = 1] = \u03b1 for all x \u2208 Zd\u2217 , independently for each site\n(see [5]).\n\n\f4\n\nM. JARA\n\nNote that the position of the tagged particle can be calculated in terms of\ntranslations\njump processes associated with \u03bet . Define Ntz as the number of\nz + 1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03be = \u03c4 \u03be . Then X = P zN z .\nby z of \u03bet , that is, Ntz = Nt\u2212\nt\nz t\u2212\nt\nt\nz\nIn this context, Kipnis and Varadhan proved a central limit theorem for\nthe position of the tagged particle when the environment process is in equilibrium with distribution \u03bc\u03b1 . They proved that \u03b5Xt/\u03b52 converges, when \u03b5\ngoes to zero, to a Brownian motion with diffusion coefficient D(\u03b1), which\ncan be described in terms of the Sobolev norms associated with the operator\nL in L(\u03bc\u03b1 ).\nThis result has been generalized by Varadhan to the mean zero case (in\nany dimension) and by Sethuraman, Varadhan and Yau for the asymmetric\ncase in dimension d \u2265 3, in which case it is proved that \u03b5[Xt/\u03b52 \u2212 mt(1 \u2212\n\u03b1)/\u03b52 ] converges to a Brownian motion with diffusion coefficient D(\u03b1), given\nby\n(1)\n\nat D(\u03b1)a = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\nX\n\n(z * a)2 p(z) \u2212 2hwa , (\u2212L)\u22121 va i\u03b1 ,\n\nz\u2208Zd\u2217\n\nwhere a \u2208 Rd , h*, *i\u03b1 is the inner product on L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 ) and va , wa are local\nfunctions defined by\nva =\n\nX\n\n(z * a)p(z)[\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7(z)],\n\nX\n\n(z * a)p(z)[\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7(\u2212z)].\n\nz\u2208Zd\n\nwa =\n\nz\u2208Zd\n\nIn general, L is not an invertible operator and so the meaning of (1) must\nbe clarified.

JARA\n\nLet H be a real Hilbert space with inner product h*, *i. An operator (not\nnecessarily bounded) L : D(L) \u2286 H \u2192 H is called positive if hg, Lgi > 0 for\nall g \u2208 D(L)\\{0}.\nGiven a positive closed operator L, we define, for f \u2208 D(L),\nkf k21 =: hf, Lf i.\nIt is easy to see that k * k1 defines a norm on D(L) that satisfies the\nparallelogram rule. Therefore, k * k1 can be extended to an inner product on\nD(L). Define H1 = H1 (L), the Sobolev space associated with the operator\nL, as the completion of D(L) under k * k1 .\nIn the same way, we see that\nkgk2\u22121 =: sup {2hg, f i \u2212 hf, Lf i}\nf \u2208D(L)\n\ndefines a norm on the set {g \u2208 H; kgk\u22121 < \u221e} that can be extended to an\ninner product.

Thanks to property (ii), the inner product h*, *i can be extended\nto a continuous bilinear form h*, *i : H\u22121 \u00d7 H1 \u2192 R.

Proof of Theorem 1. This section is organized as follows. First, we\nshow in which sense the sequence {LN }N is a finite approximation of the\noperator L. Once this has been done, the proof of Theorem 1 is reduced to\nthe verification of the hypothesis of Theorem 2, as we will see. We then verify\nthese hypotheses separately for the symmetric, mean zero and asymmetric\nsimple exclusion process.\n4.1. Finite approximations for L. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] be fixed. Let {KN }N\nbe a sequence such that as N goes to infinity, \u03b1N,KN \u2192 \u03b1, KN \u2192 \u221e and\n(2N )d \u2212 KN \u2192 \u221e. Hereafter, we omit the index KN if there is no risk of\nconfusion. Let f, gR be in L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 ). First, we deal with irrelevant constants. We\nsay that f \u223c g if (f \u2212 g) d\u03bc\u03b1 = 0. Define H = L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 )/ \u223c. It is easy to see\nthat H is isomorphic to the set of functions with mean zero in L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 ). Let\nLoc = Loc(H) be the set of local functions in H. We define HN \u223c\n= C0,N,KN as\nfollows. Consider the canonical projection \u03c0N : X\u2217 \u2192 XN,\u2217 . For f \u2208 C0,N,KN ,\n\u22121\ndefine \u03c0N\nf \u2208 Loc by\n\u22121\nf (\u03b7) =\n\u03c0N\n\n\u001a\n\nf (\u03c0N \u03b7),\n0,\n\nif \u03c0N \u03b7 \u2208 XN,KN ,\nif \u03c0N \u03b7 \u2208\n/ XN,KN .\n\n\u22121\nThen HN = \u03c0N\n(C0,N,KN )/ \u223c. It is not hard to see that Loc = N HN .\nIn fact, for a local function f , denote by supp(f ) the support of f . Then\nd , # supp(f ) < min{K , (2N )d \u2212 K }, it follows that f \u2208\nif supp(f ) \u2286 TN,\u2217\nN\nN\nHN and so, clearly, HN \u2286 Loc. On HN , we define the inner product h*, *iN\ninduced by the measure \u03bcN,KN .\nIt is clear that for f, g \u2208 Loc and N sufficiently large (note that f, g are\nnot necessarily in C0,N,KN ),\n\nS\n\nhf, giN =\n=\n\nZ \u0012\n\nf\u2212\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nf d\u03bcN,KN\n\nf g d\u03bcN,KN \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ng\u2212\n\nZ\n\nf d\u03bcN,KN\n\n\u0013\n\ng d\u03bcN,KN d\u03bcN,KN\nZ\n\ng d\u03bcN,KN .\n\nWe have already seen that the operator \u2212LN is positive and it is clear\nthat \u2212LN f = Lf for f \u2208 Loc and N sufficiently large. From the ergodicity\n\n\f10\n\nM. JARA\n\nof \u03bc\u03b1 with respect to the process generated by L and the fact that L is\na generator of a Markov process, we deduce that D\u03b1 (f ) = hf, \u2212Lf i\u03b1 > 0\nif f 6= 0, from which we see that \u2212L is a positive operator. Consequently,\n{LN }N would be a finite approximation of \u2212L if it were not for the fact\nthat HN ( HN +1 [because KN , (2N )d \u2212 KN are not necessarily increasing\nsequences]. However, it is true that HN \u2286 HM for M sufficiently large, where\nM depends both on the range of the transition probability p(*) and on the\nsequence KN [here, we use the fact that KN \u2192 \u221e and (2N )d \u2212 KN \u2192 \u221e].\nOf course, Theorem 1 applies in this situation by taking subsequences or\nslightly modifying it to fit this case. Anyway, we will say that {LN }N is a\nfinite approximation of L.\nNote that the inner product h*, *iN is exactly the product appearing in\nequation (2). Comparing equations (1) and (2), it is clear that Theorem 1\nfollows from Theorem 2 applied to the operators \u2212L and \u2212LN . So, it only remains to find suitable operators S0 and {S0,N }, to compare with L and {LN }\nand to check the hypothesis of Theorem 2 for them.\n4.2. Symmetric case. Suppose that the transition probability p(*) is symmetric, that is, p(x) = p(\u2212x) for all x \u2208 Zd . This case has been considered\nin [3], but in order to make the exposition clear, we here outline the proof\nin our setting.\nChoose S0 = \u2212L0 and S0,N = \u2212L0,N , the part of the generator corresponding to jumps in the environment. It is clear that {S0,N } is a finite approximation of S0 and that hf, S0 f i\u03b1 \u2264 hf, \u2212Lf i\u03b1 , hg, S0,N giN \u2264 hg, \u2212LN giN .\nConditions (A) and (B) of Theorem 2 are consequences in this case, of the\nnext results, with we state as lemmas.\nLemma 1.\n\nwa , va \u2208 H0,\u22121 and for all g \u2208 Loc, Lg \u2208 H0,\u22121 .\n\nProof. Following a criterion of Sethuraman and Xu [7], a sufficient\ncondition for a local function v to be in H0,\u22121 is that hvi\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nTherefore, it is enough to observe that for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], hwa i\u03b1 = hva i\u03b1 =\nhLgi\u03b1 = 0. \u0003\nLemma 2.\n\nIf g \u2208 Loc and hgi\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], then\nlim kgk0,\u22121,N = kgk0,\u22121 .\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nProof. This is just a consequence of Corollaries 2.2 and 2.4 of [3] that\nare based on the so-called Liouville-D property of the lattice Zd\u2217 . \u0003\nThe following lemma is just Theorem 4.2 of [3]:\n\n\fSTABILITY OF THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT\n\n11\n\nLemma 3.

Mean zero case.\nP Now, suppose that the transition probability has\nmean zero, that is, z zp(z) = 0. Define S = \u2212(L + L\u2217 )/2, SN = \u2212(LN +\nL\u2217N )/2, the symmetric part of the generator.

It is clear that\ns(*) is a symmetric, finite-range, irreducible transition probability, from\nwhich S (resp. SN ) is the generator of a symmetric exclusion process in Zd\u2217\nd ). We choose S = S and S\n(resp. TN,\u2217\n0\n0,N = SN . As in the symmetric case,\nS0,N N is a finite approximation of S0 and, by definition, hf, S0 f i = hf, \u2212Lf i\nand hf, S0,N f iN = hf, \u2212LN f iN . Observe that in this case, S0 and \u2212L generate the same Sobolev norms.\nAs in the symmetric case, we need to verify Assumptions (A) and (B)\nof Theorem 2. First, we need to prove that wa , va \u2208 H\u22121 and for g \u2208 Loc,\nthat Lg \u2208 H\u22121 . But this is true because hva i\u03b1 = hwa i\u03b1 = hLgi\u03b1 = 0 for all\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], H\u22121 \u2286 H0,\u22121 (in the notation of the previous subsection) and by\nthe criterion of [7], va , wa , Lg \u2208 H0,\u22121 .\nAssumption (B) of Theorem 2 then follows from Theorem 3. Therefore,\nin order to apply Theorem 2 to prove Theorem 1, it only remains to prove\nassumption (A). We state it as the following lemma:\n\n\f12\n\nM. JARA\n\nLemma 4. For all v \u2208 Loc such that hvi\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], and for\nall \u03b5 > 0, there exists g\u03b5 \u2208 Loc such that\nkv \u2212 Lg\u03b5 k\u22121 < \u03b5.\nProof. In [8], Varadhan proved a sector condition for the mean zero\nexclusion process, which roughly states that the asymmetric part of the\noperator can be bounded by the symmetric part. More precisely, there exists\na constant C = C(p(*)) such that for all f, g \u2208 Loc,\nhf, Lgi2\u03b1 \u2264 Chf, \u2212Lf i\u03b1hg, \u2212Lgi\u03b1 .\nIn particular, kLgk2\u22121 \u2264 Ckgk21 , from which it follows that L is a bounded\nand densely defined operator from H1 to H\u22121 . So, it is enough to prove that\nv \u2208 L(H1 ). To this end, we use the resolvent method. Let h be in H\u22121 \u2229 Loc.\nFor each \u03bb > 0, let u\u03bb be the solution of the resolvent equation\n\u03bbu\u03bb \u2212 Lu\u03bb = h.\nThis is always possible because L is a negative operator in L2 (\u03bc\u03b1 ) and\nu\u03bb \u2208 D(L), from which it follows that u\u03bb \u2208 H1 . The idea is to prove that\nu\u03bb (or at least a subsequence thereof) converges in some sense to a certain\nu that satisfies Lu = \u2212h. In fact, in [2], it is proven that there exists such\nu \u2208 H1 such that u\u03bb \u2192 u strongly in H1 and Lu\u03bb \u2192 \u2212h weakly in H\u22121 .\nSince L is a continuous operator, by uniqueness of limit, we have \u2212Lu = h.\nApproximating u by local functions, the lemma follows. \u0003\n4.4. Asymmetric case for d \u2265 3. In dimension d \u2265 3, a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a local function v to be in H0,\u22121 is that hvi\u03b1 = 0 [7].\nIn particular, wa , va \u2208 H0,\u22121 and for g \u2208 Loc, Lg \u2208 H0,\u22121 . As for the mean\nzero case, we choose S0 = \u2212(L + L\u2217 )/2, S0,N = \u2212(LN + L\u2217N )/2 and apply\nTheorem 2. The difference here is that for \u03b1\u2032 6= \u03b1, we have hva i\u03b1\u2032 6= 0 and so\nwe can not invoke Theorem 3 in order to prove assumption (B). The next\nlemma says that condition (B) is true for this case. The proof of this lemma\nwill be presented in the next section.\nLemma 5.\n\nIn dimension d \u2265 3, for a local function h with hhi\u03b1 = 0,\nlim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nh\u2212\n\nZ\n\nh d\u03bcN,K\n\n= khk\u22121 .\n\u22121,N\n\nA proof of assumption (A) for this case can be found in [6]. Once Assumptions (A) and (B) are verified, Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 2.\n\n\fSTABILITY OF THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT\n\n13\n\n5. Proof of Lemma 5. First, note that Lemma 5 is just the generalization,\nin dimension d \u2265 3, of Theorem 3 to the case in which hvi\u03b1 = 0 only for the\nfixed \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Consequently, in order to prove Lemma 5, it is enough to\nprove the corresponding generalizations of Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 to this case.\nNote that the k * k\u22121 norm depends only on the symmetric part S of the\ngenerator L. Define the operators S0 = (L0 + L\u22170 )/2 and S0,N = (L0,N +\nL\u22170,N )/2, the symmetric part of the jumps of the environment, as follows:\nS0 f (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\ns(y \u2212 x)\u03be(x)(1 \u2212 \u03be(y))[f (\u03c3 xy \u03be) \u2212 f (\u03be)],\n\nx,y\u2208Zd\u2217\n\nS0,N f (\u03be) =\n\ns(y \u2212 x)\u03be(x)(1 \u2212 \u03be(y))[f (\u03c3 xy \u03be) \u2212 f (\u03be)].\n\nX\n\nd\nx,y\u2208TN,\u2217\n\nThe generalizations of Lemmas 1 and 3 are proven in [7] and [3].\nLemma 6.\nH0,\u22121 .\n\nIn dimension d \u2265 3, if v \u2208 Loc satisfies hvi\u03b1 = 0, then v \u2208\n\nLemma 7. In dimension d \u2265 3, if v \u2208 Loc and hvi\u03b1 = 0, then for all\n\u03b5 > 0, there exists g\u03b5 \u2208 Loc such that\nkv \u2212 Sg\u03b5 k0,\u22121 < \u03b5.\nSo, it only remains to prove the generalization of Lemma 2 to this case.\nLet v be a local function such that hvi\u03b1 = 0.

JARA\n\nThe converse inequality is harder to prove. The idea is to approximate v\nin H0,\u22121 by local functions with mean zero for all densities \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. The\nproof requires two auxiliary lemmas. The first is just a version of Lemma\n3.6 of [3].\nLemma 9. Let w be a local function with hwi\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Let\n{fN }N be a sequence of functions defined in H0,1,N such that\nhfN , \u2212S0,N fN iN \u2264 1,\nlim hw, fN iN = A.\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nThen there exist f \u2208 H0,1 and subsequence N \u2032 such that hw, f i\u03b1 = A, hf,\n\u2212S0 f i\u03b1 \u2264 1 and for all local functions h with hhi\u03b1 = 0, for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1],\nlim hfN \u2032 , hiN = hf, hi\u03b1 .\n\nN \u2032 \u2192\u221e\n\nBefore stating the second auxiliary lemma, we need to introduce some\nnotation. Let \u039bN = {\u2212N + 1, . . . , N }d \\ {0} be the cube of radius N . Note\nd\nthat \u039bN 6= TN,\u2217\nbecause \u039bN has no periodic boundary conditions. For each\nP\nd\nx \u2208 Z\u2217 , define \u03b8x (\u03be) =: \u03be(x) and for each l > 0, define \u03c6l (\u03be) = x\u2208\u039bl \u03be(x).\nLet F\u039bN be the \u03c3-algebra generated by \u03c6l and {\u03b8x ; x \u2208 \u039bcN }. For l > 0 such\nthat supp(v) \u2286 \u039bl , define vl = E[v|F\u039bl ]. Note that there is a natural way to\ndefine vl that does not depend on the particular value of \u03b1. The following\nlemma is an easy consequence of the equivalence of ensembles:\nLemma 10. Fix positive integers l, q such that supp(v) \u2286 \u039bl and q > 2.\nDefine gn = vlqn . Then there is a finite constant \u03ba such that:\n(i) h(gn \u2212 gn\u22121 )2 i\u03b1 \u2264 \u03ba(lq n )\u2212d ,\n(ii) h(gn \u2212 gn\u22121 )2 iN \u2264 \u03ba(lq n )\u2212d .\nThe proof is as follows. For each N , there exists a function fN \u2208 H1,N\nsuch that\nhfN , \u2212S0,N fN iN \u2264 1\n\nand kv \u2212 hviN k0,\u22121,N = hfN , v \u2212 hviN iN .\n\nConsider a subsequence \u00d1 such that\nlim kv \u2212 hvi\u00d1 k0,\u22121,\u00d1 = lim sup kv \u2212 hviN k0,\u22121,N =: A.\n\n\u00d1 \u2192\u221e\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nBy Lemma 9, there exists a function f \u2208 H1 and a subsubsequence N \u2032\nsuch that hfN \u2032 , hiN \u2032 \u2192 hf, hi\u03b1 for all local functions h with mean zero for\neach \u03bc\u03b1 .
