We show that there exists a range of free\nparameters of the theory where the mass spectra of fermions are quite satisfactory from the physical\nstandpoint and correspond to the picture expected in the parton model of hadrons.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn [1], [2], the beginning was laid for investigating the relativistically invariant theory of\nfields transforming under representations of the proper Lorentz group L\u2191+ that are decomposable\ninto an infinite direct sum of finite-dimensional irreducible representations (we say that such\nfields belong to the ISFIR class).\nThe structure of relativistically invariant Lagrangians of any free fields was established and\ndescribed by Gelfand and Yaglom [3], [4]; such Lagrangians have the form\nL0 =\n\ni\n[(\u03a8, \u0393\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03a8) \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc \u03a8, \u0393\u03bc \u03a8)] \u2212 (\u03a8, R\u03a8).\n2\n\n(1)\n\nFor fields of the ISFIR class, the matrix operators \u0393\u03bc involved in Lagrangian (1) contain an\ninfinite number of arbitrary constants. Because of this, restriction to the theory of the ISFIRclass fields was performed in [1]; this restriction was achieved by imposing the condition that\nLagrangian (1) is also invariant under the secondary-symmetry transformations1)\n\u03a8\u2032 (x) = exp(\u2212iD \u03bc \u03b8\u03bc )\u03a8(x).\n\n(2)\n\nIn formula (2), the parameters \u03b8\u03bc are polar or axial four-vectors of the orthochronous Lorentz\ngroup L\u2191 , and the operators D \u03bc have a matrix realization. The chosen requirement leads to\nselecting a countable set of versions of the theory, each of which is characterized by a definite\nrepresentation of the L\u2191+ group, by single-valued (up to a normalization constant) four-vector\noperators \u0393\u03bc and D \u03bc , and by the operator R being proportional to the unit operator E.\nTo avoid infinite degeneration with respect to spin in the mass spectrum for the Lorentz\ngroup extension performed in [1] (such a degeneration is to be expected in accordance with\nthe Coleman\u2013Mandula theorem [7]), spontaneous breaking of the secondary symmetry was\npostulated in [2]: it was assumed that scalar components (with respect to the L\u2191 group)\nof one or several bosonic infinite-component fields of the ISFIR class have nonzero vacuum\nexpectations \u03bbi (the index i can, e.g., denote a chosen component of some representation of\n*\n\nE-mail: slad@theory.sinp.msu.ru\nThe notion of double symmetry, consisting of the primary and secondary symmetries, was introduced\nin [5]. It can be considered a generalization of supersymmetry and the symmetry of the Gell-Mann\u2013Levi\n\u03c3-model [6].\n1)\n\n1\n\n\fthe internal symmetry group SU (3)). Assuming that the operator R specifying the mass term\nin the Lagrangian of the free fermion field is entirely caused by spontaneous breaking of the\nsecondary symmetry, we then have\nR=\n\nX\n\n(0,1)00\n\n\u03bbi Q i\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\n(0,1)00\n\nThe operators Qi\nboson interaction\n\noccurring in relation (3) originate from the Lagrangian of the fermionLint =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u03c8(x), Q\u03c4i\u2032lm \u03c6i\u03c4 lm (x)\u03c8(x)),\n\n(4)\n\ni\u2032 ,\u03c4,l,m\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c8(x) is the fermionic field, \u03c6i\u03c4 lm (x) is the component of the bosonic field characterized\nby the finite-dimensional irreducible representation \u03c4 = (l0 , l1 ) of L\u2191+ , by the spin l (l =\n(l ,l )lm\nare\n|l0 |, |l0 | + 1, . . . , |l1 | \u2212 1), and by its projection m on the third axis, and Q\u03c4i\u2032lm \u2261 Qi\u2032 0 1\nmatrix operators. The index i\u2032 in formula (4) can include some index i from relation (3) and,\nin addition, information about transformation properties of the corresponding bosonic field\nunder the spatial reflection. The problem of the existence of a nontrivial doubly symmetric\n(0,1)00\nLagrangian (4) and of matrix elements of the operator Qi\nwas solved in [2].\nSharing the multiply expressed belief [8] that monolocal infinite-component fields can effectively represent composite particles and using the results in [1] and [2], we study the possibility\nof describing hadrons and their interactions using the doubly symmetric theory of fields of\nthe ISFIR class. For this possibility to have any chance of being realistic, the theory under\nconsideration must satisfy at least the following two requirements. First, it must ensure the\nexistence of physically acceptable mass spectra. Second, the elastic electromagnetic interaction\nof the ground fermionic state of the theory must be described by form factors similar to the\nnucleonic ones. The first requirement is addressed in this paper.\nWe recall that just the mass spectra were the main stumbling block in the previous attempts\nat a consistent relativistic description of particles with an infinite number of degrees of freedom,\nrealized as different states of the same field, because in all the cases considered, the spectra\nhad an accumulation point at zero. This conclusion regarding the mass spectra was drawn,\nin particular, by Ginzburg and Tamm [9], Yukawa [10], Shirokov [11], and Markov [12] in\ntheir analyses of certain particular bilocal equations and also by Gelfand and Yaglom [3] and\nKomar et al. [13] with regard to the general linear relativistically invariant equations based\non representations of the group L\u2191+ that are decomposable into a finite direct sum of infinitedimensional irreducible representations.\nThe result obtained in this work should therefore appear all the more important: the\ndoubly symmetric theory of infinite-component fields of the ISFIR class has mass spectra that\nqualitatively reproduce the characteristic features of the experimental physics of hadrons and\nthe parton bag model. We give its derivation and detailed formulation only for fermionic fields\nin the versions of the theory with one free parameter. Versions of the theory with three, five, and\nmore free parameters with sufficiently high positions of the mass-spectrum levels (relative to\nthe ground level) with any given precision reduce to the versions with a single parameter. Some\nof the mass-spectrum characteristics that we obtain occur as consequences of exact analytic\ncalculations, and others are the result of applying numerical methods.\nAfter solving the main problem, we give some attention in this paper to the problem of\ncomparing the theoretical mass spectrum with the levels of hadron resonances. We then note\na nontrivial feature of the ISFIR-class fields that a state of such a field can be manifested\nexperimentally as a group of several nearby resonances with different spins. We indicate a\npossible identification of such groups in the case of nucleon resonances (see the table below).\nThe confidence level of this identification cannot be established otherwise than by using an\n\n2\n\n\fextensive analysis involving, first, the expected correspondence between the theoretical and\nexperimental nucleon and \u03c0-meson levels, second, the wave functions found for each of the\ntheoretical states involved in the analysis, and, third, comparison of the results of theoretical\n(based on Lagrangian (4)) and experimental partial-wave analysis of the production amplitude\nof \u03c0N -states in the ranges of the observed nucleon resonances.\n\n2. Equations and conditions for state vectors of particles\ndescribed by ISFIR-class fields\nThe subject of our analysis is the linear relativistically invariant equations for a free\nfermionic field of the ISFIR class,\n(\u0393\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + iR)\u03c8(x) = 0,\n\n(5)\n\ncorresponding to Lagrangians (1). For a field corresponding to a plane wave with a zero spatial\nwave vector \u03c8(x) = exp(\u2212iM t)\u03c8M 0 , Eq. (5) becomes\n(M \u03930 \u2212 R)\u03c8M 0 = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nFor each allowed value of the spin and its third projection, this equation becomes one or several\nrecursive relations for the components of an infinite-component field \u03c8M 0 . For any value of M ,\nthese relations themselves give one or several linearly independent solutions up to a numerical\nfactor.\nIf Eqs. (6) were a closed mathematical problem, then it would most likely be complemented\nby the normalizability condition for its solutions. But in particle physics, we are interested not\nso much in the fields as in the amplitudes of the processes that are expressed through currents\nof the form (\u03c8M 0 , O\u03c8M p ) in the theory under consideration. The field vector \u03c8M p is obtained\nfrom the vector \u03c8M 0 via a transition from one reference frame to another such that the wave\nfour-vector {M, 0, 0, 0} transforms into the four-vector {E, 0, 0, p}. The role of the operator O\ncan be played by any of the matrix operators Q\u03c4i\u2032lm , \u0393\u03bc , D \u03bc , or R in the theory. The currents\n(\u03c8M 0 , O\u03c8M p ) are in turn expressed through infinite series whose terms are quadratic in the\ncomponents of the vectors \u03c8M 0 and linear in the matrix elements of finite transformations of the\nproper Lorentz group. Therefore, instead of the normalizability condition for solutions of Eq.\n(6), we introduce a more restrictive condition that the relevant series converge, which we call\nthe finite-amplitude condition. For any of the operators O above, the matrix elements relating\nthe irreducible representations \u03c4 = (\u00b11/2, l1 ) and \u03c4 \u2032 = (1/2, l1 + n\u2032 ) or \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 = (\u22121/2, l1 + n\u2032\u2032 ),\nwhere n\u2032 and n\u2032\u2032 are integers, have the asymptotic behavior as l1 \u2192 +\u221e of the form l1\u03b2 , where\n\u03b2 is some constant. In view of this and of the asymptotic form of the field vector components\n\u03c8M 0 and \u03c8M p as l1 \u2192 +\u221e, which is given in this work, we can verify that for any fixed value\nof M , either all the series corresponding to the above currents converge or all of them diverge.\nWe therefore formulate the finite-amplitude condition for any value of p as the relation\n|(\u03c8M 0 , R\u03c8M p )| < +\u221e\n\n(7)\n\n(\u03c8M \u2032 0 , R\u03c8M p ) = a(p)\u03b4(M \u2032 \u2212 M ),\n\n(8)\n\nor\nwhere a(p) is a nonzero number. Those and only those field vectors \u03c8M 0 that satisfy Eq. (6)\nand relations (7) or (8) are called state vectors of a mass-M particle; this particle is a point in\nthe respective discrete or continuum part of the mass spectrum.\nUsing formula (19) below and the appropriate analogue of formula (18), we can easily verify\nthat if relation (8) is satisfied for some value p = p0 , then it cannot be satisfied for p > p0 .\n\n3\n\n\fTherefore, in the theory of ISFIR-class fields under consideration, the mass spectrum cannot\nhave a continuum part.\nFor p = 0, finite-amplitude condition (7) or (8) becomes the normalizability condition for\nsolutions of Eq. (6). We note that the finite-amplitude condition and the normalizability\ncondition for solutions lead to the same mass spectra in all versions of the theory considered\nin Secs. 4\u20136 below. In some versions considered in Sec. 3, there is a nonempty discrete mass\nspectrum if the normalizability condition for solutions of Eq. (6) is satisfied, whereas the\nfinite-amplitude requirement leads to an empty mass spectrum.\nWe now give the needed results in [1] and [2] concerning the doubly symmetric theory of\nISFIR-class fields with the spontaneously broken secondary symmetry considered here.\nThe L\u2191+ -group representation S, under which the fields transforms, must coincide with one\nof the infinite-dimensional representations S k1 (k1 is a half-integer, k1 \u2265 3/2),\nS\n\nk1\n\n=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nk1 \u2212 32\n\nX\n\nn1 =0 n0 =\u2212k1 +\n\n1\n\u2295( + n0 , k1 + n1 ).\n2\n1\n\n(9)\n\n2\n\nIn the representation space of S k1 , the operator \u03930 is given by\ns\n\n0\n\n\u0393 \u03be(l0 ,l1 )lm = c0 D(l1 )\n\n(l \u2212 l0 )(l + l0 + 1)(k1 \u2212 l0 \u2212 1)(k1 + l0 )\n\u03be\n(l1 \u2212 l0 )(l1 \u2212 l0 \u2212 1)(l1 + l0 )(l1 + l0 + 1) (l0 +1,l1 )lm\n\ns\n\n(l \u2212 l0 + 1)(l + l0 )(k1 \u2212 l0 )(k1 + l0 \u2212 1)\n\u03be\n(l1 \u2212 l0 + 1)(l1 \u2212 l0 )(l1 + l0 \u2212 1)(l1 + l0 ) (l0 \u22121,l1 )lm\n\ns\n\n(l1 \u2212 l)(l1 + l + 1)(l1 \u2212 k1 + 1)(l1 + k1 )\n\u03be\n(l1 \u2212 l0 )(l1 \u2212 l0 + 1)(l1 + l0 )(l1 + l0 + 1) (l0 ,l1 +1)lm\n\ns\n\n(l1 \u2212 l \u2212 1)(l1 + l)(l1 \u2212 k1 )(l1 + k1 \u2212 1)\n\u03be\n,\n(l1 \u2212 l0 \u2212 1)(l1 \u2212 l0 )(l1 + l0 \u2212 1)(l1 + l0 ) (l0 ,l1 \u22121)lm\n\n+c0 D(l1 )\n\u2212c0 D(l0 )\n\u2212 c0 D(l0 )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03be(l0 ,l1 )lm is a vector of the canonical basis in the space of the irreducible representation,\n\u03c4 = (l0 , l1 ) \u2208 S k1 , and c0 is an arbitrary real constant. The function D(j) of a half-integer\nargument j is given by the formula\nD(j) = 1\n(11)\nif the secondary symmetry of the theory is generated by a polar four-vector representation of\nL\u2191 (Corollary 1 in [1]) and by the formula\n1\n\nD(j) = (\u22121)j\u2212 2 j\n\n(12)\n\nif the secondary symmetry of the theory is generated by an axial four-vector representation of\nL\u2191 (Corollary 2 (A. 2) in [1]).\nFor the operator R in the representation space S k1 and for both versions of the secondary\nsymmetry in the considered theory, the same relations hold,\nR\u03be(l0 ,l1 )lm = r(l0 , l1 )\u03be(l0 ,l1 )lm =\n\n\"\n\nX\n\n#\n\n\u03bbi qi (l0 , l1 ) \u03be(l0 ,l1 )lm ,\n\ni\n\nqi (\u2212l0 , l1 ) = qi (l0 , l1 ),\n(k1 \u2212 l0 \u2212 1)(k1 + l0 )qi (l0 + 1, l1 ) + (k1 \u2212 l0 )(k1 + l0 \u2212 1)qi (l0 \u2212 1, l1 )\n\u2212(k1 \u2212 l1 \u2212 1)(k1 + l1 )qi (l0 , l1 + 1) \u2212 (k1 \u2212 l1 )(k1 + l1 \u2212 1)qi (l0 , l1 \u2212 1) =\n\n4\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\f= zi (l1 \u2212 l0 )(l1 + l0 )qi (l0 , l1 )\n\n(15)\n\nwith zi = 2 \u2212 HiB /H F . The quantities HiB and H F are normalization constants of the vector\noperators D \u03bc (with D \u03bc D\u03bc = HE) entering transformations (2) of the respective bosonic and\nfermionic fields \u03c6i (x) and \u03c8(x). They are independent of each other. For some fixed value of\nH F , the quantity HiB and hence the parameter zi can take any values. Indeed, if secondary\nsymmetry transformation (2) of the bosonic field \u03c6i (x) is nontrivial (D \u03bc 6= 0) and this field\nis complex (just such fields were considered in [1] and [2]), then HiB > 0. If transformation\n(2) is nontrivial and the bosonic field is real, then HiB < 0. But if transformation (2) of the\n(0,1)00\nbosonic field is trivial, then zi = 2, the operator Qi\nis proportional to the unit operator E,\nand the existence of a nonzero vacuum expectation of this field does not affect the secondary\nsymmetry.\nIn what follows, we only deal with fermionic fields transforming under the \"lowest\" of\nthe proper Lorentz group representations S k1 in (9), namely, the representation S 3/2 , whose\ndecomposition involves all finite-dimensional irreducible representations that contain spin 1/2\nand only such representations. A solution of recursive relation (15) for this representation (k1 =\n3/2) was expressed in [2] through the Gegenbauer polynomials and through hypergeometric\nseries. It turns out that this solution can also be expressed through the elementary functions,\n1\n1\n, l1\nqi \u2212 , l1 = qi\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n= 2qi0\n\nN\nuN\ni (ui N + N + 1) \u2212 wi (wi N + N + 1)\n,\nN (N + 1)(ui \u2212 wi )(2 + ui + wi )\n\nq\n\n(16)\n\nq\n\nwhere N = l1 \u2212 1/2, ui = (zi + zi2 \u2212 4)/2, and wi = (zi \u2212 zi2 \u2212 4)/2.\nIn accordance with formulas (10) and (13), the operators \u03930 and R are diagonal in the\nspin index l and in the spin projection index m, and their matrix elements are independent\nof m. Therefore, each vector \u03c8M 0 satisfying Eq. (6) can be assigned certain values of spin\nand its projection. Components of this vector can be taken independent of the value of m.\nLinearly independent solutions of Eq. (6) can be chosen such that they have a definite P P\nparity. We recall that P \u03be(\u00b11/2,l1 )lm = (\u22121)l\u22121/2 \u03be(\u22131/2,l1 )lm . If a vector l1 [\u03c7(l1 )\u03be(\u22121/2,l1 )lm +\n\u03c7(l1 )\u03be(1/2,l1 )lm ] with the P -parity (\u22121)l\u22121/2 satisfies condition (7) and Eq. (6) with M = M0 ,\nP\nthen the vector l1 [\u2212\u03c7(l1 )\u03be(\u22121/2,l1 )lm + \u03c7(l1 )\u03be(1/2,l1 )lm ], which has the P -parity (\u22121)l+1/2 , also\nsatisfies condition (7) and Eq. (6) but with M = \u2212M0 .\nIn the representation space S 3/2 of the L\u2191+ group, Eq. (6) for the field vector components\n(\u03c8M 0 )(\u00b11/2,l1 )lm \u2261 \u03c7lm (l1 ) with the spatial parity (\u22121)l\u22121/2 becomes\n\u0012 \u0013p\n\n1\nD\n2\n\n\u0012 \u0013p\n\n1\n(l1 \u2212 l)(l1 + l + 1)\n\u03c7lm (l1 + 1) + D\n2l1 + 1\n2\n\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\n(l1 \u2212 l \u2212 1)(l1 + l)\n\u03c7lm (l1 \u2212 1)\n2l1 \u2212 1\n\nD(l1 )(2l + 1)\n1\n\u2212\nr(l1 ) \u03c7lm (l1 ) = 0,\n2\n4l1 \u2212 1\n2M c0\n\u0015\n\n(17)\n\nwhere l1 \u2265 l and r(l1 ) \u2261 r(\u00b11/2, l1 ).\nWe write the relativistically invariant bilinear form of relation (7) via components of the\nvectors \u03c7lm (l1 ) and via matrix elements of finite transformations of the proper Lorentz group,\n1\n\n(\u03c8M 0 , R\u03c8M p ) =\n\n2\nX\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n1\n\n(\u22121)l\u2212 2 \u03c7\u2217lm (l1 )r(l1 ){[exp(\u03b1I 03 )](l0 ,l1 )lm,(l0 ,l1 )lm }\u03c7lm (l1 ),\n\n(18)\n\nl0 =\u2212 21 l1 =l+1\n\nwhere tanh \u03b1 = p/ M 2 c2 + p2 and I 03 is the infinitesimal operator of the group L\u2191+ .\nThe explicit form of matrix elements of finite transformations of the L\u2191+ group for infinitedimensional unitary irreducible representations, denoted by a pair of numbers (l0 , \u03bd), was\np\n\n5\n\n\ffound in [14]. The argument and the results in that work also hold for the finite-dimensional\nirreducible representations that interest us here. To preserve the precise meaning of the notation\nthat we use, we must set \u03bd = il1 . In considering the convergence problem for the series of form\n(18), we need only know the asymptotic behavior of the relevant matrix elements as l1 \u2192 +\u221e.\nWe have\nexp(\u03b1l1 )\n(1 + O(l1\u22121 )),\n(19)\n[exp(\u03b1I 03 )](l0 ,l1 )lm,(l0 ,l1 )lm = T0\nl1\nwhere the quantity T0 is independent of l1 .\nIn what follows, we discuss the mass spectra in two versions of spontaneous secondary\nsymmetry breaking: caused by one bosonic field of the ISFIR class (in which case the index i is\nto be omitted everywhere) or caused by two bosonic fields. In the first version, we separately\nconsider three essentially different ranges of the z parameter values: (\u2212\u221e, \u22122], (\u22122, 2), and\n(2, +\u221e). In the second version, attention is given only to the range z1 \u2208 (2, +\u221e) and z2 \u2208\n(\u22122, 2).\n\n3. Empty mass spectrum in the parameter range z \u2208 (\u22122, 2)\nIn the case where the secondary symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken, we cannot\nfind solutions of Eq. (17) in the form of elementary or special functions, finite or infinite series.\nWe also fail to find analytic formulas for mass spectra of the theory. But we can derive a\nnumber of conclusions regarding the mass spectra based on the asymptotic behavior of certain\nquantities.\nLet z \u2208 (\u22122, 2). Using formula (16), we then have\nr(l1 ) = r0\n\nsin \u03b6l1\n(1 + O(l1\u22121 ))\nl1\n\n(20)\n\nas l1 \u2192 +\u221e, where \u03b6 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and r0 is a constant. From this and Eq. (17), we obtain\n\u0002 l1 \u0003\n\n\u03c7lm (l1 ) = A0 (\u22121)\nas l1 \u2192 +\u221e, where\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0002 l1 +1 \u0003\n\nl1s (1 + K(l1 ) + O(l1\u22122 )) + B0 (\u22121)\n\ns = (2l + 1) 1 \u2212 D\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\n,\n\n2\n\nr0\n\n1\n\nK(l1 ) = (\u22121)l1 + 2\n\nl1\u2212s (1 \u2212 K(l1 ) + O(l1\u22122 ))\n\n2M c0 D\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n1\n2\n\nsin \u03b6\n\n*\n\ncos \u03b6l1\n,\nl1\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\n[a] is the integer part of the number a, and the quantities A0 and B0 are independent of l1 .\nBased on this asymptotic formula, it is easy to establish that for \u03b1 6= 0, the terms of series\n(18) grow as l1 \u2192 +\u221e independently of whether A0 is equal to zero for certain values of M .\nTherefore, if z \u2208 (\u22122, 2), then a solution of Eq. (17) cannot satisfy finite-amplitude condition\n(7) at any value of M , and the mass spectrum is hence empty.\n\n4. Characteristics of the mass spectra in the parameter range\nz \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u22122]\nBecause the inequalities w < \u22121 and \u22121 < u < 0 hold in the range z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u22122), it follows\nfrom (16) and (17) that as l1 \u2192 +\u221e,\n1\n\nwl1 + 2\n(1 + O(l1\u22121 )),\nr(l1 ) = r0\nl1 + 12\n\n(23)\n\n\u03c7lm (l1 ) = A0 G(l1 )(1 + O(l1\u22121 )) + B0 G\u22121 (l1 )(1 + O(l1\u22121 )),\n\n(24)\n\n6\n\n\fwhere\n1\n\n4l2\n1 \u22121\n\nv l1 \u2212 2 w 8\n,\nG(l1 ) =\n(l1 \u2212 21 )!\n\nv=\u2212\n\nr0\n.\nM c0 D( 12 )\n\n(25)\n\nObviously, if A0 is nonzero for some values of M , then condition (7) cannot be satisfied.\nBut if A0 = 0 for some value of M , then the terms of series (18) have the asymptotic form\n2\nof the order of (l1 + 1/2)!(l1 \u2212 1/2)!v \u22122l1 u(4l1 \u22121)/4 exp(\u03b1l1 ) as l1 \u2192 +\u221e. The ratio of such a\nterm of the series to the preceding term is equal to zero in the limit l1 \u2192 +\u221e. Therefore, the\nrelevant series (18) converges for the discussed value of M , which is equivalent to condition (7)\nbeing satisfied.\nTherefore, for all values of the parameter z in the range z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u22122) and for both versions\nof the theory expressed by relations (11) and (12), the mass spectrum is discrete whenever it\nis nonempty.\nA similar statement also holds for z = \u22122. This is easy to verify taking into account\nthat in this case, r(l1 ) = r0 (\u22121)l1 +1/2 l1 and an analogue of relation (24) holds with G(l1 ) =\n1\n2\nv l1 \u2212 2 (\u22121)(4l1 \u22121)/8 (l1 \u2212 1/2)!.\nWe now prove that in the range z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u22122], the set of all masses of the theory is bounded\nfrom below by a positive number. For this, it suffices to find a number \u03bc0 > 0 such that for\nthe set of values of M satisfying the restriction |M | \u2264 \u03bc0 , the field components lm(l1) are not\narbitrarily small for sufficiently large values of l1 .\nUsing formula (16), we verify that in the range z \u2264 \u22122, the quantity |r(l1 )| increases\nmonotonically as l1 increases and the function r(l1 ) of a half-integer argument has alternating\nsigns, r(l1 + 1)/r(l1 ) < 0. Let \u03bc1 = |r(3/2)/c0 | and |M | \u2264 \u03bc1 /2. Then for both versions of\nthe function D(j) (Eqs. (11) and (12)) and for all the allowed values of l and l1 , the quantity\nD(l1 )(l + 1/2)/(l12 \u2212 1/4) \u2212 r(l1 )/M c0 is greater than one in absolute value and changes its sign\nas l1 changes by 1. Together with Eq. (17), this gives the desired inequality |\u03c7lm (l1 + 1)| >\n|\u03c7lm (l1 )|.\nFor convenience in what follows, we use one or another relation between the normalization\nconstants, thus obtaining different mass units. If r(3/2)/(2c0 D(1/2)) = \u00b11 (the plus and minus\nsigns refer to the respective relations (11) and (12), chosen such that the lower levels of the\nspin-1/2 particle have the spatial parity +1), we introduce the notation Mc = |M |. Any number\nof the lower values of mass Mc can be found using numerical methods. In accordance with the\nabove, only the range Mc > 0.5 is to be considered in numerical calculations. To find all points\nof the spectrum in the relevant ranges of Mc and of the parameter z for a fixed spin l, it suffices\nto restrict to seeking points Mc at which the quantity A0 in Eq. (24) vanishes but does not have\na minimum or a maximum for some fixed value of z. In arbitrary small neighborhoods of such\npoints in the mass spectrum, the quantity \u03c7lm (l1 ) then obviously changes its sign for sufficiently\nlarge values of l1 . This plays the role of an algorithm for solving the mass problem numerically.\nAnalyzing the dependence of any two chosen neighboring points of the mass spectrum on the\nparameter z, we can find whether a value z0 exists such that in tending to it from one side,\nthese points become arbitrarily close to each other but do not appear on the other side of z0 .\nIf such a number z0 exists, then the limit value of the two chosen points is the mass value Mc\nat which the quantity A0 has the zero value and an extremum.\nIn Figs. 1 and 2, in the cases corresponding to the respective relations (11) and (12), we\nshow the dependence of the masses of the states with spins 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and 7/2 on the\nparameter z.\nWe first note several characteristics of the mass spectrum of the theory with double symmetry generated by the axial four-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group\n(which corresponds to relation (12)). First, the mass spectrum is nonempty if the spatial parity\nof spin-l particles is (\u22121)l\u22121/2 and is empty if the parity is (\u22121)l+1/2 . Second, among the mass\n\n7\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n-12\n\n-11\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nFigure 1: Dependence of the mass levels on the parameter z for z < \u22122 in the theory with double\nsymmetry generated by the polar four-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group.\n\nlines, there are pairs that terminate, merging at certain common limit points for z0 < \u22122;\nthere are also single lines that exist in the entire range z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u22122]. Third, for all z, from\nthe range (\u2212\u221e, \u22122.1) at least, the levels of the mass spectrum have the same ordering in accordance with spin. It is the same as for z = \u22122.645 for example, where the lower masses Mc\n(with spin and parity lP ) are given by 1.982(1/2)+ , 3.209(3/2)\u2212 , 3.687(1/2)+ , 5.470(5/2)+ ,\n6.143(3/2)\u2212 , 6.964(1/2)+ , 9.709(7/2)\u2212 , 10.72(5/2)+ , 11.91(3/2)\u2212 , 13.35(1/2)+ , 17.82(9/2)+ ,\nand 19.38(7/2)\u2212 . The lowest-level masses with a given spin increase as the spin increases\nsomewhat faster than the geometric progression. A sequence of mass levels taken in consecutive order with the same spin is close to the geometric progression. Therefore, although the\nratio of lowest-level masses with the spin and parity (3/2)\u2212 and (1/2)+ in the above example\nis equal to the mass ratio of the N (1520) resonance and the nucleon, the positions of levels\nwith lP = (5/2)+ , (7/2)\u2212 , (9/2)+ , etc., are drastically different from the positions of the corresponding nucleonic resonances [15]. Fourth, for the parameter values close to z = \u22122, the level\nordering in the mass spectrum in accordance with spin changes as z changes. For example,\nfor z = \u22122, the lower levels Mc (lP ) are 9.506(5/2)+ , 12.14(9/2)+ , 12.55(3/2)\u2212 , 13.25(5/2)+ ,\n15.77(13/2)+ , 16.03(19/2)\u2212 , and 17.45(21/2)+ .\nAmong the mass-spectrum characteristics in the theory with double symmetry generated\nby the polar four-vector representation of the L\u2191 group (which corresponds to relation (11)),\nwe note the following. First, particles at any value of spin have the same spatial parity +1.\nSecond, the set of all mass lines is decomposed into pairs that merge and terminate at z0 < \u22122.\nThird, the lower-level masses with two consecutive spins, whenever they exist for a given z in\n\n8\n\n\f20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-2.9\n\n-2.8\n\n-2.7\n\n-2.6\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.4\n\n-2.3\n\n-2.2\n\n-2.1\n\n-2\n\nFigure 2: Dependence of the mass levels on the parameter z for z < \u22122 in the theory with double\nsymmetry generated by the axial four-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group.\n\nthe range under consideration, differ from each other by an order of magnitude at least, which\nmanifestly contradicts the baryon resonance picture.\n\n5. Characteristics of the mass spectra in the parameter range\nz \u2208 (2, +\u221e)\nBecause the inequalities u > 1 and 0 < w < 1 are satisfied in the range z \u2208 (2, +\u221e),\nformulas (23)\u2013(25) hold, and the subsequent argument regarding the validity of condition (7)\nis applicable if w is replaced with u and u with w inthese formulas and in the corresponding\nargument. This implies the conclusion that for all values of z \u2208 (2, +\u221e) in both versions of the\ntheory corresponding to relations (11) and (12), the mass spectrum is discrete if it is nonempty.\nIt follows from relation (16) that in the range z > 2, the quantity r(l1 )/r(3/2) is positive and\nincreases monotonically as l1 increases. This fact and Eq. (17) with l1 > l lead to the inequality\n|\u03c7lm (l1 )| > (1 + 1/(l1 \u2212 l))|\u03c7lm (l)| for all l and for all values of M in the range |M | \u2264 \u03bc1 /3,\nwhere \u03bc1 = |r(3/2)/c0 |. In the range of M specified, therefore, series (18) diverges, condition\n(7) is not satisfied, and mass-spectrum points are absent, i.e., the mass spectrum is bounded\nfrom below.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, corresponding to the respective formulas (11) and (12), we show the\ndependence of the lower mass levels on the parameter z for spins 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and 7/2, each\nof which is assigned the spatial parities +1 and \u22121. As z \u2192 2 + 0, the masses Mc tend to unity\non all lines in both versions of the theory. For any z > 2, the masses of several lower levels with\nconsecutive spins l and with the parities (\u22121)l\u22121/2 approximate a geometric progression.

An essential difference\nbetween the two versions of the theory is in the order of relative positions of the lower levels\nwith two consecutive spin values and a given parity. To illustrate all this, we give numerical\nexamples below, where the mass ratio of the lower levels with lP = (3/2)\u2212 and lP = (1/2)+ in\nthe theory considered is the same as for the N (1520) resonance and the nucleon.\nWe note several characteristic features of the mass spectrum for the version of the theory\nwith relation (11). First, the mass-level ordering in accordance with spin and parity is the\nsame for all values of the parameter z from the range (2, +\u221e). It is such as for z = 2.441 for\nexample, when the lowest masses Mc and the corresponding spin and parity lP are given by\n1.595(1/2)+ , 2.328(1/2)\u2212 , 2.582(3/2)\u2212 , 3.699(1/2)+ , 3.700(3/2)+ , 4.346(5/2)+ , 5.609(1/2)\u2212 ,\n6.111(5/2)\u2212 , 6.158(3/2)\u2212 , 7.522(7/2)\u2212 , 9.272(1/2)+ , and 9.174(3/2)+ . Second, certain mass\nlevels with different lP differ from each other insignificantly in a considerable neighborhood of\nthe point z = 2. Such a small difference occurs for the (n + 1)th level with lP = (1/2)+ and\nthe nth level with lP = (3/2)+ , for the (n + 1)th level with lP = (3/2)\u2212 and the nth level with\nlP = (5/2)\u2212 , and for the (n + 1)th level with lP = (5/2)+ and the nth level with lP = (7/2)+\n(n \u2265 1), etc.\nFor the version of the theory with relation (12), the general level ordering in accordance with\nspin and parity can be different for different values of the parameter z. But the ordering of the\nlowest levels with some lP is the same for all z > 2. This ordering is as in the following example,\n\n10\n\n\f10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n2.9\n\n3\n\nFigure 4: Dependence of the mass levels on the parameter z for z > 2 in the theory with double\nsymmetry generated by the axial four-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group.\n\nwhere all the levels with Mc < 4 are given, evaluated at z = 2.261: 1.108(1/2)+ , 1.272(3/2)+ ,\n1.521(1/2)\u2212 , 1.567(5/2)+ , 1.794(3/2)\u2212 , 2.041(7/2)+ , 2.119(1/2)+ , 2.272(5/2)\u2212 , 2.573(3/2)+ ,\n2.769(9/2)+ , 2.999(1/2)\u2212 , 3.027(7/2)\u2212 , 3.342(5/2)+ , 3.747(3/2)\u2212 , and 3.876(11/2)+ .\nOn the whole, therefore, the doubly symmetric theory with one parameter z connected\nwith spontaneous secondary symmetry breaking gives the following qualitative picture of the\nmass spectra. The continuum part of the mass spectrum does not exist for any values of z. If\nthe mass spectrum is nonempty for some z, then the mass levels are bounded from below by\na positive quantity. In the parameter range z > 2, each value of spin and parity corresponds\nto a countable set of masses extending up to infinity, and the lowest mass level values with a\ngiven spin increase as the spin increases. The theory with one parameter z does not give a\nsatisfactory quantitative agreement with the nucleon resonance levels.\n\n6. Comparison of the mass spectrum of the theory with two\nparameters zi with nucleon resonance levels\nThe general situation with the mass spectra of the theory involving two bosonic fields of\nthe ISFIR class with nonvanishing vacuum expectations of their scalar components (scalar with\nrespect to the group L\u2191 ) is quite rich with different versions. In what follows, we consider only\none version in some detail with the aim of a tentative quantitative comparison of the theoretical\nmass spectrum with the nucleon resonance levels.\nWe consider the theory with the double symmetry generated by the polar four-vector representation of the orthochronous Lorentz group (with the corresponding relation (11)). With\n\n11\n\n\ftwo parameters zi , the quantity r(l1 ) in Eq. (17) can be written as\nr(l1 ) = f0\n\nq1 ( 12 , l1 )\nq2 ( 21 , l1 )\n+ f2\n,\nq10\nq20\n!\n\n(26)\n\nwhere qi (1/2, l1 ) depends on zi and is given by formula (16). It is obvious that in addition to\nthe normalization constant f0 /c0 , this theory involves three free parameters: z1 , z2 , and f2 .\nWe choose the following restrictions on them: z1 > 2, |z2 | < 2, and |f2 | < 1. In this parameter\nrange, as l1 increases, the quantity |q1 (1/2, l1 )| increases monotonically and q2 (1/2, l1 ) oscillates\nwith a decreasing amplitude. The quantities r(l1 ) and f0 q1 (1/2, l1 )/q10 have the same sign for\nall l1 and can be significantly different from each other only for small values of l1 . The parameter\nz2 has no effect on the asymptotic behavior of the quantities r(l1 ) and \u03c7lm (l1 ) as l1 \u2192 +\u221e.\nFormulas (23)\u2013(25) are valid if w in them is replaced with u1 ; the conclusions regarding the\nmass spectra following from these formulas are also valid. Therefore, in the considered version\nof the theory with two parameters z1 and z2 , compared with the version of the theory with\na single parameter z1 , only mass spectrum levels with the lowest values of the spin l can\nsignificantly change their positions.\nWe now note a very important circumstance inherent in the theory of infinite-component\nfields considered. Let the ground fermionic and the ground bosonic levels of the theory correspond to the respective particles F with spin 1/2 and B with spin 0, and let an excited\nfermionic level exist in the theory with the corresponding particle F \u2217 of spin l. We consider\nthe amplitude M of the decay F \u2217 \u2192 F B in the rest frame of the resonance F \u2217 described by\nLagrangian (4). Because the particles F and B have nonzero velocities in this reference frame,\nthe corresponding infinite-component fields of the ISFIR class have nonzero components with\nthe respective all half-integer and all integer spins. Therefore, the amplitude M has nonzero\nterms in which the components of the F \u2217 , F , and B fields are described by the following sets\nof spins {lF \u2217 , lF , lB }: {l, l, 0}, {l, l \u2212 1, 1}, {l, l, 1}, {l, l + 1, 1}, {l, l \u2212 2, 2}, . . ., {l, l + 2, 2}, . . ..\nThe contribution of a given spin l\u2032 of the fermion F and spin l\u2032\u2032 of the boson B to the amplitude\nM can be estimated only if the state vectors of the particles F \u2217 , F , and B are known in their\nrest frames. Because experimental conclusions about a resonance spin are obtained from the\npartial-wave analysis, based on the representations of the three-dimensional rotation group but\nnot on representations of the Lorentz group, it follows that the aforesaid may be manifested\nin the experimentalist opinion regarding the existence of a group of several resonances that\nhave the same mass and differ from each other only by their spins. Therefore, in comparing\nthe theoretical mass spectrum with the experimental one, we must pay special attention to\nsuch groups of resonances and make the decision regarding the number of the corresponding\ntheoretical levels.\nThe simplest proposed correspondence between the theory version under consideration\nand the experimental picture of nucleon resonances is given in Table 1. It corresponds to\nthe normalization constant and the free parameters chosen as f0 /c0 = \u2212939/2.4686 MeV,\nz1 = 2.036, z2 = 0.14, and f2 = \u22120.6724. The parameters z2 and f2 are chosen such that\nthe lowest-level masses with lP = (3/2)\u2212 and lP = (5/2)+ are respectively equal to 1508\nand 1675 MeV. The parameter z1 = 2.036 determines particle states with large spins. As\nthe experimental masses of almost all resonances, we take their pole positions. The Breit\u2013\nWigner masses (indicated with the BW superscript in the table) are taken, first, for those few\nresonances whose pole positions are not given in [15] and, second, for the Roper resonance\nN (1440) because two poles, 1370 \u2212 114i and 1360 \u2212 120i, have been found in the neighborhood\nof 1440 MeV with their parameters strongly different from the usual M = 1470 MeV and\n\u0393 = 545 MeV [16].\nA tentative comparison of the mass spectra of the theory considered here with levels of\nnonnucleon resonances has not been made yet. In particular, it requires the singlet\u2013octet\n\n12\n\n\fseparation of the \u039b resonances and an octet\u2013decuplet separation of the \u03a3 and \u039e resonances in\naccordance with the internal symmetry group SU (3). The description of the \u2206 resonances is\nsupposedly to be given by the S 5/2 representation of the L\u2191+ group described by formula (11)\nwith k1 = 5/2. In this case, the lowest mass level has the spin 3/2. Analyzing mass spectra of\nbosonic fields of the ISFIR class in any versions of the doubly symmetric theory will become\npossible only after finding the structure of the Lagrangian of the four-particle interaction of\nsuch fields with each other and the ensuing spontaneous violation of secondary symmetry.\nTable 1\nTheory\nMass\nlP\n(MeV)\n1+\n939\n2\n1+\n1481\n2\n1\u2212\n1487\n2\n3\u2212\n1508\n2\n3+\n2\n\n5+\n2\n\n(\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n5\u2212\n2\n1\u2212\n2\n7\u2212\n2\n3\u2212\n2\n1+\n2\n5+\n2\n3+\n2\n7+\n2\n9+\n2\n\n...\n\n11 \u2212\n2\n\n...\n\n13 +\n2\n\n1661\n\n1675\n\nlP\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n1892\n1923\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(\n\n1940\n1995\n2004\n2144\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n2140\n2179\n2244\n...\n2547\n...\n2919\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(\n\n1+\n2\n1+\n2\n1\u2212\n2\n3\u2212\n2\n1\u2212\n2\n5\u2212\n2\n3+\n2\n5+\n2\n3\u2212\n2\n1+\n2\n3+\n2\n7+\n2\n7\u2212\n2\n5+\n2\n3\u2212\n2\n1+\n2\n1\u2212\n2\n5\u2212\n2\n9\u2212\n2\n9+\n2\n\nExperiments [15]\nMass\nResonance\n(MeV)\nN\n939\nN (1440)\n1430-1470BW\nN (1535)\n1495-1515\nN (1520)\n1505-1515\nN (1650)\n1640-1680\nN (1675)\n1655-1665\n1650-1750\nN (1720)\n\nStatus\n****\n****\n****\n****\n****\n****\n****\n\nN (1680)\nN (1700)\nN (1710)\n\n1665-1675\n1630-1730\n1670-1770\n\n****\n***\n***\n\nN (1900)\nN (1990)\n\n\u2248 1900BW\n1870-1930\n\n**\n**\n\nN (2190)\nN (2000)\nN (2080)\nN (2100)\n\n1950-2150\n\u2248 2000BW\n1980-2120\n2080-2160\n\n****\n**\n**\n*\n\nN (2090)\nN (2200)\nN (2250)\n\n2080-2220\n2040-2160\n2080-2200\n\n*\n**\n****\n\nN (2220)\n\n2100-2240\n\n****\n\n11 \u2212\n2\n\nN (2600)\n\n2550-2750BW\n\n***\n\n13 +\n2\n\nN (2700)\n\n\u2248 2700BW\n\n*\n\nAcknowledgments.
