Given a knot K we may construct a group Gn (K) from the fundamental group of K by adjoining an nth root of the meridian that commutes\nwith the corresponding longitude. These \"generalised knot groups\" were introduced independently by Wada and Kelly, and contain the fundamental group\nas a subgroup. The square knot SK and the granny knot GK are a well known\nexample of a pair of distinct knots with isomorphic fundamental groups. We\nshow that Gn (SK) and Gn (GK) are non-isomorphic for all n \u2265 2. This confirms a conjecture of Lin and Nelson, and shows that the isomorphism type of\nGn (K), n \u2265 2, carries more information about K than the isomorphism type\nof the fundamental group. The appendix contains some results on representations of the trefoil group in P SL(2, p) that are needed for the proof.\n\n1. Introduction\nWada [8] and Kelly [5] independently introduced a family of link invariants Gn (L)\ngeneralising the fundamental group of a link L in S 3 . These groups may be defined\nvia Wirtinger-type presentations, with conjugation by the generator xj corresponding to the over-arc replaced by conjugation by xnj , but also admit a description in\nterms of the peripheral system of L. The group G1 (L) is simply the fundamental\ngroup of L, and the second description of Gn shows that G1 (L) is a subgroup of\nGn (L) for each n.\nThe square knot SK and the granny knot GK are a well known example of a\npair of distinct knots with isomorphic fundamental groups. They are therefore a\nnatural choice for a pair of knots on which to test the strength of the invariant\nGn . Lin and Nelson [6] report the results of computer experiments in which they\nwere unable to distinguish Gn (SK) and Gn (GK) by counting homomorphisms to\nselected finite groups of orders as large as 360. Although they were not successful\nin distinguishing Gn (SK) and Gn (GK), they nevertheless conjectured that these\ngroups were non-isomorphic for each n \u2265 2. The purpose of this paper is to confirm\ntheir conjecture, and thereby show that the isomorphism types of the generalised\nknot groups carry more information about K than the isomorphism type of the\nfundamental group itself.\nWe will distinguish Gn (SK) and Gn (GK) for n \u2265 2 by comparing the number\nof homomorphisms into suitably chosen finite groups. Our target groups will be\nwreath products over P SL(2, p), and are described in Section 3. Our main result\nis the following theorem:\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

For each n \u2265 2 there is a finite group H such that\n| Hom(Gn (GK), H)| < | Hom(Gn (SK), H)|.\n\nConsequently, Gn (GK) is not isomorphic to Gn (SK) for n \u2265 2.\nRemark 1.2. Although our work confirms Lin and Nelson's conjecture that Gn (SK)\nand Gn (GK) are non-isomorphic for all n \u2265 2, it also provides counterexamples\nto their initial claim that | Hom(Gn (SK), H)| = | Hom(Gn (GK), H)| for all finite\ngroups H. The source of the error lies in the statements about permutations used to\nprove Proposition 4.1 of arXiv versions 1 and 2 of their paper, which are incorrect.\nThis claim has been withdrawn in the text of subsequent arXiv and the published\nversions of their paper, although it still appears in the abstract of the published\nversion.\n1.1. Update. Since this paper was written, Nelson and Neumann [7] have shown\nvia topological methods that G2 (K) determines the knot K up to reflection. They\nextend their result to Gn (K), n > 2, using the Scott-Swarup JSJ decomposition\nfor groups.\n1.2. Organisation. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we describe\nWada and Kelly's generalised link groups, and obtain presentations for the generalised knot groups of the square and granny knots. We construct our target groups\nin Section 3, and establish some results that will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.1, which appears in Section 4. Finally, we include an appendix by David\nSavitt, which contains two results on P SL(2, p) that are needed for the proof.\n2. Generalised link groups\n2.1. Definition and presentations. The groups Gn (L) may be defined in several\ndifferent ways. Wada defines them via the closed braid form of L, using an action\nof the braid group Bm on the free group Fm that is compatible with the Markov\nmoves. He observes that they admit a Wirtinger-type presentation, and gives a\ntopological description of them as the fundamental group of a space associated\nwith the link. Kelly, on the other hand, approaches them via the link quandle and\nthe Wirtinger-type presentation. We will chiefly use Wada's topological description,\nas this leads to simpler calculations for the groups we are interested in.\nTo define Gn (L) topologically we glue a torus to each boundary component of\nthe exterior of L. We do this via the map f : S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 S 1 given by\nf (z1 , z2 ) = (z1n , z2 ), where z1 represents the meridian and z2 the longitude. The\ngroup Gn (L) is defined to be the fundamental group of the resulting space, and is\nclearly an invariant of L.\nTo obtain a presentation for Gn (L) we may take as generators elements xi corresponding to each arc of the link diagram. This leads to a Wirtinger-type presentan\ntion, with a relation xk = xnj xi xj\u2212n at each left-handed crossing, and xk = x\u2212n\nj xi xj\nat each right-handed crossing (see Fig. 1). However, we may also apply the Seifertvan Kampen Theorem to obtain a presentation of Gn (L) from a presentation\n\u03c01 (S 3 \\ L) = hg1 , . . . , gm |r1 , . . . , rp i\n\nas follows. Suppose that L has l components, and let \u03bci , \u03bbi be words in the\ngenerators representing a meridian-longitude pair of the ith component. If the torus\nglued to the ith boundary component has fundamental group h\u03bdi , \u03c1i |\u03bdi \u03c1i = \u03c1i \u03bdi i,\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\nxk\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nxi\n\nxk\n\nxj\n\nxj\nxk =\n\nxnj xi x\u2212n\nj\n\n3\n\nxi\nxk =\n\nn\nx\u2212n\nj xi xj\n\nFigure 1. The Wirtinger-type relations at left- and right-handed crossings.\nthen the gluing induces the identifications \u03bci = \u03bdin , \u03bbi = \u03c1i , and we conclude that\nGn (L) has a presentation\nGn (L) = hg1 , . . . , gm , \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdl |r1 , . . . , rp , \u03bdin = \u03bci , \u03bbi \u03bdi = \u03bdi \u03bbi , i = 1, . . . , li.\nThus, Gn (L) is obtained from the fundamental group of L by adjoining an nth root\nof each meridian that commutes with the corresponding longitude. Note that, since\n\u03bci and \u03bdi commute, we are not required to use zero-framed longitudes, and may\nfreely replace \u03bbi with \u03bb\u2032i = \u03bbi \u03bcki for any k.\nWhen K is a knot the presentation above reduces to\nGn (K) = hg1 , . . . , gm , \u03bd|r1 , . . . , rp , \u03bd n = \u03bc, \u03bb\u03bd = \u03bd\u03bbi.\n\n\u221a\nLet n \u03bc denote the set of nth roots of \u03bc in Gn (K), and let C be the centraliser of\n\u221a\n\u03bc in \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K). Then C acts on n \u03bc by conjugation, and in particular, when K\nis composite the longitude of each factor permutes the nth roots of \u03bc. This action\nunderlies the method by which we will distinguish Gn (SK) and Gn (GK).\nRemark 2.1. Crisp and Paris [2] generalise Wada's representations of the braid\ngroups and use their generalisations to define further group invariants of links.\nGiven a group H and an element h of H their construction leads to an invariant\n\u0393(H,h) , such that Gn is the case H = Z, h = n. Topologically, their construction\nreplaces the attached tori with attached copies of X \u00d7 S 1 , where \u03c01 (X) \u223c\n= H and\neach meridian is attached to a loop representing h. Careful attention is paid to the\nframing in attaching the S 1 factor to the boundary torus.\nThe ability of such an invariant to distinguish links depends on the extent to\nwhich it is able to remember the peripheral system. Conway and Gordon [1] define\nan extension of \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) that completely classifies knots up to oriented equivalence. Their construction allows them to recover the subgroups h\u03bci, h\u03bbi as the\nimages of the normalisers of certain subgroups of finite order. This method does\nnot appear to be directly applicable to Gn , since it has no torsion, but might apply\nto \u0393(H,h) for suitably chosen H and h.\nRemark 2.2. When n = 2 the space used to define Gn (L) topologically is a closed\nnon-orientable 3-manifold. Nelson and Neumann's proof [7] that G2 (K) determines\nK up to reflection uses the JSJ decomposition of this 3-manifold.\n2.2. The square and granny knots. In this section we obtain presentations for\nthe generalised knot groups of the square and granny knots. Our presentations may\nbe obtained from those given in [6], but our derivation uses the Seifert-van Kampen\n\n\f4\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\nc\n\nc\n\nPSfrag replacements\na\nb\n\na\nleft-handed trefoil\n\nb\nright-handed trefoil\n\nFigure 2.

The\nfundamental groups of these knots are therefore amalgamated free products of two\ncopies of the trefoil group. Accordingly, we begin by fixing notation for the trefoil\ngroup T . We choose generators for T as shown in Fig. 2, so that for both the left\nand right trefoils we have\nT \u223c\n= ha, c|aca = caci.\n= ha, b, c|ab = bc = cai \u223c\nThis may be put in the form\nT \u223c\n= hx, y|x3 = y 2 i\nby letting x = ab, y = abc, and we note that any two of a, c, x and y generate T .\nThe 0-framed longitude corresponding to a of the right-handed trefoil is represented\nby (bac)a\u22123 , while that of the left-handed trefoil is represented by (c\u22121 a\u22121 b\u22121 )a3 .\nNote that x3 = (bac)a3 and x\u22123 = (c\u22121 a\u22121 b\u22121 )a\u22123 respectively also represent\nlongitudes corresponding to a, albeit with framings 6 and \u22126.\nTo obtain presentations and longitudes of the square knot and granny knot\ngroups we refer to Fig. 3. The group \u03c01 (S 3 \\ (K1 #K2 )) is given by\n\u03c01 (S 3 \\ (K1 #K2 )) = \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K1 ) \u2217h\u03bci \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K2 ),\nand has meridian and longitude \u03bc = \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 , \u03bb = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 .

The multiplicative group F\u00d7\n\u2212 1, and so\nqr\u22121 is cyclic of order q\ncontains an element \u03b6 of order r, because r divides q r\u22121 \u2212 1 by Fermat's Theorem.\nWe may therefore define multiplication in Dq,r = V \u22ca Z/rZ by\n(v, i) * (w, j) = (v + \u03b6 i w, i + j).\n\nWe remark that when r = 2 we have V = Z/qZ, and \u03b6 = \u22121 of (multiplicative)\norder two in (Z/qZ)\u00d7 . Thus Dq,2 is isomorphic to Dq , the dihedral group with 2q\nelements. The group D2,3 is also isomorphic to a familiar group, the alternating\ngroup A4 . Under an isomorphism D2,3 \u2192 A4 the normal subgroup V = (Z/2Z)2\nmaps onto the Klein 4-group generated by the permutations of order two.\nTo define the wreath product we regard vectors in (Fp )2 as rows, and use the\nfaithful action of P SL(2, p) on the projective line induced by the natural action of\nSL(2, p) on row vectors by right multiplication. For convenience we will identify\nthe point in P1 (Fp ) with homogeneous co-ordinates [x : y] with\u0014 the quotient\nx/y \u2208\n\u0015\na b\nZ/pZ \u222a {\u221e}; under this identification the action of the class of\nin P SL(2, p)\nc d\n\n\f6\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\naz + c\n. This right action on\nbz + d\nP1 (Fp )\nindices induces a left action of P SL(2, p) on (Dq,r )\n, and we define Hpq,r to be\n1\nthe semidirect product of (Dq,r )P (Fp ) by P SL(2, p) defined by this action. Elements\nof Hpq,r then have the form\n\u0001\n\u03b1 = (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1p\u22121 , \u03b1\u221e ), \u03b1\u0302 ,\n\nis given by the fractional linear transformation z 7\u2192\n\nwhere \u03b1i \u2208 Dq,r for each i and \u03b1\u0302 \u2208 P SL(2, p), and multiplication is given by\n(\u03b1\u03b2)i = \u03b1i \u03b2i*\u03b1\u0302 ,\n\nc = \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302.\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\nNote that as permutations, \u03b1\u0302 and \u03b2\u0302 are composed from left to right. We adopt the\n\u0001\u22121\nconvention that \u03b1i\u22121 means (\u03b1i )\u22121 , so that (\u03b1\u22121 )i = \u03b1i*\u03b1\u0302\u22121\n= \u03b1\u22121\ni*\u03b1\u0302\u22121 .\nThe quotient map Dq,r \u2192 Z/rZ induces a quotient map\nHpq,r \u2192 Z/rZ \u2240 P SL(2, p).\nWe will write [g] for the image of g \u2208 Dq,r in Z/rZ, so that the map Hpq,r \u2192\nZ/rZ \u2240 P SL(2, p) is given by\n\u0001\n[\u03b1] = ([\u03b10 ], [\u03b11 ], . . . , [\u03b1p\u22121 ], [\u03b1\u221e ]), \u03b1\u0302 .\n\nThis map splits, and it will be convenient to distinguish a subgroup of Hpq,r isomorphic to Z/rZ \u2240 P SL(2, p). Fixing \u03be \u2208 Dq,r such that [\u03be] = 1 \u2208 Z/rZ we let\nArp = h\u03bei \u2240 P SL(2, p) \u2286 Hpq,r .\nSince Z/rZ is abelian we may quotient further to get a well defined map\nHpq,r \u2192 Z/rZ \u2240 P SL(2, p) \u2192 Z/rZ,\ngiven by\n[[\u03b1]] = [\u03b10 ] + [\u03b11 ] + * * * + [\u03b1p\u22121 ] + [\u03b1\u221e ].\n\nThe subgroup V \u2240 P SL(2, p) has a similarly defined map k * k : V \u2240 P SL(2, p) \u2192 V .\nWe will use these abelianisations in Section 4.4.\nTo prove Theorem 1.1 we will choose p co-prime to n, q dividing n, and r coprime to n and |P SL(2, p)|. These divisibility requirements reflect the roles that\nthe factors P SL(2, p), (Z/qZ)r\u22121 and Z/rZ play in the proof. The P SL(2, p) factor\nensures that there are nontrivial homomorphisms G \u2192 Hpq,r ; the (Z/qZ)r\u22121 factor\nwill give us many nth roots; and the Z/rZ factor will exhibit the nontrivial action\nby x3 , w3 \u2208 G on the roots of the meridian.\nRemark 3.1. When p = 5 we have P SL(2, 5) \u223c\n= A5 , which was the group used\nby Fox [4] to show that the complements of the square and granny knots can be\ndistinguished by their peripheral subgroups.\n3.2. Example. As an aid to understanding we illustrate the above constructions in\nthe case of H35,2 . This group is not used in the proof of Theorem 1.1 (distinguishing\nw\u00b13 will ultimately hinge on being able to distinguish \u00b13k in Z/rZ), but has the\nadvantage of being a small example with a simple geometric interpretation.\nThe permutation representation of P SL(2, 3) on P1 (F3 ) induces an isomorphism\nbetween P SL(2, 3) and A4 . Since D5,2 is isomorphic to D5 , we therefore have\nH35,2 \u223c\n= D5 \u2240 A4 . To give this group a geometric interpretation let P be the group\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n7\n\n1\n2\nPSfrag replacements\n\u03c1\n\n0\n\n\u03c3\n\n3\n4\n\nFigure 4.

For example, relabelling pentagons one and\n\u0001 two\n5,2\nby\n(1,\n\u03b1\n,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n,\n1),\n1\n, and\nso that \u03b10 and \u03b11 are the \"identity\"\nconjugates\nH\n0\n0 1\n3\n\u0001\ntakes \u03b1 to (1, 1, \u03b10 \u03b11 \u03b12 , \u03b1\u221e ), \u03b1\u0302 . The composition \u03b10 \u03b11 \u03b12 occurring here is a\nmap from the zeroth pentagon to itself, and as such is well defined up to conjugacy\nunder such relabellings. We will refer to such a composition around a cycle of \u03b1\u0302 as\na cycle-product.\nLet \u03b5 be an element of H35,2 such that \u03b5\u0302 = \u03b1\u0302 =\n\u0001 (0 1 2) and \u03b5i*\u03b5\u0302 = \u03b5i for all i.\nIn other words, \u03b5 has the form (\u03b50 , \u03b50 , \u03b50 , \u03b5\u221e ), \u03b1\u0302 . Using\n\u0001 a similar relabelling to\nthe above we find that \u03b5 is conjugate to (1, 1, \u03b530 , \u03b5\u221e ), \u03b1\u0302 . Since the cycle-product\n\u03b10 \u03b11 \u03b12 necessarily has a cube root \u03b7 in D5 , we may set \u03b50 = \u03b7, \u03b5\u221e = \u03b1\u221e and\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n9\n\nconclude that \u03b1 is conjugate to \u03b5. The benefit of this is that certain calculations \u0001are\nsimpler for \u03b5 than they are for \u03b1: for example, \u03b5k is simply (\u03b5k0 , \u03b5k0 , \u03b5k0 , \u03b5k\u221e ), \u03b1\u0302k .\nIn Section 3.4 we will say that an element \u03b5 such that \u03b5i is constant on orbits\nof \u03b5\u0302 is in standard\n\u0001 form. For \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 as above we find\u0001that \u03b1 is conjugate to\n(\u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c14 \u03c3), \u03b1\u0302 , and \u03b3 is conjugate to (\u03c14 , \u03c13 \u03c3, \u03c14 , \u03c14 ), \u03b3\u0302 . Thus, both \u03b1 and \u03b3\nare conjugate \u0001to elements in standard form; in fact, \u03b1 may be conjugated further to\n(\u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c3), \u03b1\u0302 , so \u03b1 is conjugate to an element of A23 in standard form. However, \u03b2\ncannot be conjugated to standard form, because the cycle-product \u03b20 \u03b2\u221e = \u03c13 \u03c3 has\nno square root in D5 . Our arguments in later sections will be simplified by showing\nthat we can typically avoid this situation, and restrict our attention to elements in\nstandard form.\n3.3. The structure of Dq,r . We will make use of the following facts about elements of Dq,r and representations of T in Dq,r :\nLemma 3.2.\n(1) If g \u2208 Dq,r then the order of g is 1, q, or r.\n(2) If g, h \u2208 Dq,r commute then either g, h \u2208 V , or g and h belong to the same\ncyclic subgroup of order r.\n(3) If g = (v, 0) has order q then the conjugacy class of g is\n{(\u03b6 i v, 0)|0 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1},\n\nand if g = (v, i) has order r then the conjugacy class of g is {h : [h] = i}.\n(4) If {q, r} 6= {2, 3} then a homomorphism \u03c6 : T \u2192 Dq,r factors through Z.\nProof. Since elements of V have order 1 or q, to prove part (1) it suffices to show\nthat an element (v, i) with i 6\u2261 0 has order r. This follows from the fact that \u03b6\nsatisfies the equation\n1 + \u03b6 i + \u03b6 2i + * * * + \u03b6 (r\u22121)i = 0\nin Fqr\u22121 .\nTo prove part (2), suppose that g = (v, i), h = (w, j) commute and that g 6\u2208 V .\nWe must show that h \u2208 hgi. The equation gh = hg is\n(v + \u03b6 i w, i + j) = (w + \u03b6 j v, i + j),\n\nwhich gives (1 \u2212 \u03b6 j )v = (1 \u2212 \u03b6 i )w. Our assumption that g 6\u2208 V is equivalent to\ni 6\u2261 0 mod r, which implies firstly that 1 \u2212 \u03b6 i is nonzero in Fqr\u22121 , and secondly that\nthere is some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r such that j \u2261 ki mod r. Thus\n1 \u2212 \u03b6 ki\nv\n1 \u2212 \u03b6i\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6 i )(1 + \u03b6 i + \u03b6 2i + * * * + \u03b6 (k\u22121)i )\n=\nv\n1 \u2212 \u03b6i\n\u0001\n= 1 + \u03b6 i + \u03b6 2i + * * * + \u03b6 (k\u22121)i v,\n\nw=\n\nand it follows that h = g k .\nPart (2) implies that the stabiliser of g \u2208 Dq,r has order q r\u22121 if g has order q,\nand order r if g has order r. Thus, the conjugacy class of g has size r if g has\norder q, and size q r\u22121 if g has order r. Part (3) now follows from the fact that the\nconjugacy class of (v, 0) must contain the r element set consisting of the orbit of v\nunder the action of h\u03b6i, and the fact that the conjugacy class of (v, i) is contained\nin the q r\u22121 element set {h : [h] = i}.\n\n\f10\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\nFinally, to prove part (4) we consider the image of x3 = y 2 , which generates the\ncentre of T . By (2), if x3 does not map to the identity then the image of \u03c6 lies\nin an abelian subgroup, and \u03c6 must factor through the abelianisation T \u2192 Z. On\nthe other hand, if {q, r} 6= {2, 3} and \u03c6(x)3 = \u03c6(y)2 = 1, then at least one of \u03c6(x),\n\u03c6(y) must be the identity, in which case the image of \u03c6 lies in the cyclic subgroup\ngenerated by the other.\n\u0003\n3.4. The cycle-product and some consequences. In this section we gather\nsome results on conjugacy classes, centralisers, and mth powers in Hpq,r that will\nbe needed in what follows. Our main tool for proving the results will be the cycleproduct, which may be regarded as a kind of monodromy.\nGiven \u03b1 \u2208 Hpq,r and i \u2208 P1 (Fp ) we define the cycle-product of \u03b1 at i by\nli (\u03b1\u0302)\u22121\n\n\u03c0i (\u03b1) =\n\nY\n\nk=0\n\n\u03b1i*\u03b1\u0302k = \u03b1i \u03b1i*\u03b1\u0302 \u03b1i*\u03b1\u03022 * * * \u03b1i*\u03b1\u0302li (\u03b1\u0302)\u22121 ,\n\nwhere li (\u03b1\u0302) is the length of the disjoint cycle of \u03b1\u0302 containing i. The cycle-product\nis thus the ordered product, beginning at i, of \u03b1j for j in the disjoint cycle of\n\u03b1\u0302 containing i. We note that the value of the cycle-product on a given cycle\ndepends on the starting point i, but the conjugacy class does not, because \u03c0i*\u03b1\u0302 (\u03b1) =\n\u03b1\u22121\ni \u03c0i (\u03b1)\u03b1i .\nGiven \u03b3 \u2208 Hpq,r we will say that \u03b3 is in standard form if\n\u03b3i*\u03b3\u0302 = \u03b3i\n\nl (\u03b3\u0302)\n\u03b3i i\n\n= 1 if and only if \u03b3i = 1, we will say that \u03b3 is\nfor all i. If in addition \u03c0i (\u03b3) =\nin reduced standard form. Our first two results generalise the example at the end\nof Section 3.2, and show that many elements of Hpq,r are conjugate to an element\nin reduced standard from.\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that li (\u03b1\u0302) is co-prime to the order of \u03c0i (\u03b1) for all i. Then\n\u03b1 is conjugate to an element \u03b3 in reduced standard form such that \u03b3\u0302 = \u03b1\u0302 and \u03c0i (\u03b3)\nis conjugate to \u03c0i (\u03b1) for all i.\nProof.

Let \u03b1 be an element in reduced standard form, and suppose that \u03b3\ncommutes with \u03b1. If \u03b1i is constant on orbits of \u03b3\u0302 then \u03b3i commutes with \u03b1i for\neach i, and \u03b3i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302.\nProof. We have (\u03b1\u03b3)i = \u03b1i \u03b3i*\u03b1\u0302 , and (\u03b3\u03b1)i = \u03b3i \u03b1i*\u03b3\u0302 = \u03b3i \u03b1i .

Therefore \u03b1i i\nNow \u03b1i i\ngenerates h\u03b1i i, because \u03b1i has prime order. It follows that \u03b1i and \u03b3i commute, and\nequation (3.1) becomes \u03b3i*\u03b1\u0302 = \u03b3i , as required.\n\u0003\nFinally, we give a necessary condition for \u03b1 \u2208 Hpq,r to be an mth power.

As observed by Lin and Nelson [6] in the case K = SK or GK,\nevery homomorphism from Gn (K) to a group H arises as a compatible choice of a\nhomomorphism from G1 (K) to H and an nth root of the image of the meridian.\nGiven a map \u03c1 : G1 (K) \u2192 H and an element \u03b7 of H, we will say that (\u03c1, \u03b7) is a maproot pair for K in H if \u03b7 n = \u03c1(\u03bc). Clearly, a map-root pair defines a homomorphism\n\u03c1\u0303 : Gn (K) \u2192 H precisely when it satisfies the compatibility condition\n\u03c1(\u03bb)\u03b7 = \u03b7\u03c1(\u03bb).\n\nSince G1 (SK) and G1 (GK) are both isomorphic to\nG = ha, c, f |aca = cac, af a = f af i,\n\nwith common meridian a, map-root pairs for GK and SK in Hpq,r co-incide. A pair\n(\u03c1, \u03b7) is compatible for SK if\n\u03c1(x3 w\u22123 )\u03b7 = \u03b7\u03c1(x3 w\u22123 ),\nand it is compatible for GK if\n\u03c1(x3 w3 )\u03b7 = \u03b7\u03c1(x3 w3 ).\nWe may regard a homomorphism \u03c1 : G \u2192 Hpq,r as a pair of homomorphisms\n\u03c1c , \u03c1f : T \u2192 Hpq,r such that \u03c1c (a) = \u03c1f (a), using the fact that\nG = ha, ci \u2217hai ha, f i \u223c\n= T \u2217hai T.\nGiven \u03b1 \u2208 Hpq,r , let\n\nC(\u03b1) = {\u03b2 \u2208 CHq,r\n(\u03b1) : \u03b2\u0302 = 1}.\np\n\nWe define an action of C(\u03b1) on map-root pairs (\u03c1, \u03b7) = ((\u03c1c , \u03c1f ), \u03b7) such that\n\u03c1(a) = \u03b1 by \u03b2 * (\u03c1, \u03b7) = (\u03b2 * \u03c1, \u03b7), where\n\u03b2 * (\u03c1c , \u03c1f ) = (\u03c1c , \u03b2\u03c1f \u03b2 \u22121 ).\n\nWe prove Theorem 1.1 by showing that, for suitably chosen p, q and r,\n(I) for any map-root pair (\u03c1, \u03b7) for SK and GK in Hpq,r , the orbit of (\u03c1, \u03b7)\nunder the action of C(\u03c1(a)) contains at least as many compatible pairs for\nSK as it does for GK; and\n(II) there are compatible map-root pairs (\u03c1, \u03b7) for SK in Hpq,r such that the orbit\nof (\u03c1, \u03b7) under the action of C(\u03c1(a)) contains no pairs that are compatible\nfor GK.\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n13\n\nThe prime r will be chosen so that r is co-prime to n and |P SL(2, p)|. This\nimplies that r is co-prime to 6, because 6 divides the order of P SL(2, p) for all p.\nThe primes p and q will be chosen depending on n as follows:\n(1) If n is not divisible by 30 then we let p be the least prime co-prime to n,\nand let q be any prime dividing n. In this case p = 2, 3 or 5, P SL(2, p) is\nisomorphic to S3 , A4 or A5 , and r is co-prime to 6n if p = 2 or 3, or to 30n\nif p = 5.\n(2) If 30 divides n then we may choose q \u2265 5 dividing n, and we choose p\nco-prime to n such that P SL(2, p) has no elements of orders 4, 5, 9, or q.\nFor p co-prime to 2 we have\n1\np(p \u2212 1)(p + 1),\n2\nso P SL(2, p) has no elements of orders 5, 9 or q if p 6\u2261 0 or \u00b11 mod 5, 9 or q. To\nshow that we may avoid elements of order 4 we use the fact that \u22121 is a sum of\ntwo squares mod p. If a2 + b2 = \u22121 in Z/pZ then the matrices\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 1\na b\n,\n\u22121 0\nb \u2212a\n|P SL(2, p)| =\n\nbelong to SL(2, p), and for p \u2265 3 their images in P SL(2, p) generate a subgroup K\nisomorphic to Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z. If p is congruent to 3 or 5 mod 8 then |P SL(2, p)| \u2261\n4 mod 8, so K is a Sylow 2-subgroup and there are no elements of order 4. Sufficient\nconditions on p in case (2) may thus be expressed in terms of congruence conditions\nmodulo 5, 8, 9 and q, and Dirichlet's Theorem guarantees that we may choose p as\nrequired.\nThe conditions on p, q and r are chosen in part so that the order of a nontrivial\nnth power in P SL(2, p) satisfies the following lemma. In particular, the lemma\nshows that when n is divisible by 30 we may use Proposition A.5. This will be\nimportant when we study the image of the longitude in Section 4.4.\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03c4 n = \u03c6 6= 1 in P SL(2, p). Then the orders of \u03c4 and \u03c6 are\nco-prime to both q and r. If 30 \u2224 n then p = 2, 3 or 5, and\n(\n2 or 3 if p = 2 and gcd(3, n) = 1,\nord(\u03c4 ) = ord(\u03c6) =\np\notherwise.\nIf 30 | n then ord(\u03c6) > 6.\nProof. The fact that ord(\u03c4 ) and ord(\u03c6) are co-prime to r is immediate from the\nfact that r is co-prime to |P SL(2, p)|; the fact that they are co-prime to q comes\nfrom the fact that P SL(2, p) has no elements of order q if 30 | n, and no elements\nof order q 2 when 30 \u2224 n.\nThe statements about ord(\u03c4 ) and ord(\u03c6) when 30 \u2224 n are proved by explicitly\nconsidering the orders of elements in P SL(2, p). If p = 5 then an element of\nP SL(2, 5) \u223c\n= A5 has order 1, 2, 3 or 5. Since we use p = 5 exactly when n is\ndivisible by 6 but not by 5, a nontrivial nth power and its root must both have\norder 5. Similar arguments apply when p = 2 or 3.\nFinally, if 30 | n then n is divisible by 6, so \u03c6 is a sixth power. In this case\n2 \u2264 ord(\u03c6) \u2264 6 is impossible, because otherwise some power of \u03c4 would have order\n4, 5 or 9, contrary to the choice of p.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\n4.2. Overview. In order to prove statements (I) and (II) we must calculate the\nnth roots of the image of the meridian, and the possible images of the longitudes\nx3 , w3 of the two factor knots. We do this in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 respectively, and\nthen prove statements (I) and (II) in Section 4.5. In Sections 4.3 and 4.4 we will\nrestrict our attention to nth powers in Hpq,r that project to nontrivial elements of\nP SL(2, p), as nth powers that project to the identity are easily handled separately.\nThe calculations will be simplified by first showing that up to conjugacy, such an\nnth power is an element of Arp in reduced standard form. We assume throughout\nthat p, q and r are chosen as described in the preceding section.\nThe results and arguments of the following sections are fairly technical, and it\nwill be helpful to have an overview of the ideas underlying the proof. These are\nmost readily seen when \u03c1(a) = \u03b1 = \u03b7 n is in reduced standard form, and the order\nof \u03b7\u0302 is co-prime to n. We outline the argument in this case. Under these conditions\n\u03b7\u0302 is a power of \u03b1\u0302, so the orbits of \u03b1\u0302 and \u03b7\u0302 co-incide. Lemma 3.5 thus implies that\n\u03b7 is in standard form, and we therefore have\n\u03b1i = (\u03b7 n )i = (\u03b7i )n\nin Dq,r . Since n is divisible by q but not by r, either \u03b1i is of order r and \u03b7i is the\nunique nth root of \u03b1i in h\u03b1i i, or \u03b1i = 1 and \u03b7i \u2208 V . Thus, nth roots \u03b7 of \u03b1 with\nord \u03b7\u0302 co-prime to n are parametrised by V c , where c is the number of cycles of \u03b7\u0302\non which \u03b1i = 1.\nTo calculate the possible values of \u03b5 = \u03c1(x3 ) we will use Theorem A.1, which\nshows that either \u03b5\u0302 = \u03b1\u03026 , or \u03b5\u0302 = 1. Since \u03b5 commutes with \u03b1, Lemma 3.5 implies\nthat \u03b5i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302, and commutes with \u03b1i for all i. When \u03b5\u0302 = \u03b1\u03026\nwe will be able to show that in fact \u03b5 = \u03b16 , and when \u03b5\u0302 is trivial Proposition A.5\nwill allow us to show that [\u03b5i ] is constant. Consequently, in the latter case [\u03b5i ]\nis equal to the average value [[\u03b5]]/(p + 1), which is equal to 6[[\u03b1]]/(p + 1). The\nsame arguments apply to \u03b4 = \u03c1(w3 ), so the action on V c induced by \u03b5 or \u03b4 acting\non the roots of \u03b1 by conjugation is either trivial, or is given by multiplication by\n\u03b6 6[[\u03b1]]/(p+1) . Writing the compatibility conditions in the form\n\u03b4 \u22121 \u03b7\u03b4 = \u03b5\u22121 \u03b7\u03b5,\n\n\u03b4\u03b7\u03b4 \u22121 = \u03b5\u22121 \u03b7\u03b5,\n\nit is easily checked that for such roots either both, neither, or only the left condition\n(that for SK) will be satisfied. The strict inequality in Theorem 1.1 will come from\nshowing that this last case can in fact occur.\nIn general, \u03b5 and \u03b4 will be as described above, but \u03b7\u0302 need not be a power of \u03b1\u0302,\nso \u03b7 need not be in standard form. As a result, the set parametrising the nth roots\nof \u03b1 that project to a given element of P SL(2, p) can be more complicated. The\nproduct V c will nevertheless still occur as a factor, with \u03b5 and \u03b4 acting as above\nagain playing an important role in determining compatibility. However, it will no\nlonger be the case that a compatible pair for GK is necessarily compatible for SK,\nnecessitating our use of the C(\u03b1)-action as an accounting device.\n4.3. The image and roots of the meridian. In this section we characterise up\nto conjugacy solutions to the pair of equations \u03b7 n = \u03b1, \u03b1\u0302 6= 1. This determines the\npossible values of the image and root of the meridian in a map-root pair (\u03c1, \u03b7) with\nd 6= 1. In what follows we will use 1/n to denote the multiplicative inverse of n\n\u03c1(a)\nin Z/rZ.\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n15\n\nLemma 4.2. If \u03b1 is an nth power in Hpq,r such that \u03b1\u0302 6= 1, then \u03b1 is conjugate to\nan element of Arp in reduced standard form.\nLemma 4.3. Let \u03b1 be an element of Arp in reduced standard form such that \u03b1\u0302 6= 1,\nand suppose that \u03c4 is an nth root of \u03b1\u0302 in P SL(2, p). Then \u03b1 has an nth root\n\u03b7 \u2208 Hpq,r such that \u03b7\u0302 = \u03c4 if and only if \u03b1i is constant on orbits of \u03c4 . If so,\nthen \u03b7i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302. Let \u03c3 be a disjoint cycle of \u03c4 of length l, let\nd = gcd(l, n), and let j \u2208 P1 (Fp ) belong to \u03c3. Then \u03b7i is completely determined on\n\u03c3 by the values of \u03b7j , \u03b7i*\u03c4 , . . . , \u03b7i*\u03c4 d\u22121 .

Equations (4.1) and (4.2) reduce respectively to \u03b7j = \u03b1j and \u03b7j \u2208 V , in\nagreement with our treatment of this case in Section 4.2.\nProof. If \u03b7 n = \u03b1 then by Lemma 3.6 we have\n\u0001n/ gcd(n,li (\u03b7\u0302))\n\u03c0i (\u03b1) = \u03c0i (\u03b7)\n.\n\nNow q divides n but not li (\u03b7\u0302), by Lemma 4.1, so \u03c0i (\u03b1) is a qth power in Dq,r .\nTherefore \u03c0i (\u03b1) has order 1 or r for each i. Since li (\u03b1\u0302) is co-prime to r for all\ni, Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 imply that \u03b1 is conjugate to an element of Arp in reduced\nstandard form. This proves Lemma 4.2\nWe now suppose that \u03b1 is an element of Arp in reduced standard form, and that\n\u03b7 is an nth root of \u03b1 such that \u03b7\u0302 = \u03c4 . Let \u03c3, l and d be as in the statement of the\nlemma. Then \u03c3 n consists of d disjoint cycles of length l/d, so if i belongs to \u03c3 we\nhave\nl/d\n\u03c0i (\u03b1) = \u03b1i = \u03be l[\u03b1i ]/d .\nBy Lemma 3.6 the conjugacy class of \u03c0i (\u03b1) is constant on \u03c3, so l[\u03b1i ]/d is constant\non \u03c3 by Lemma 3.2. Since l is co-prime to r this implies that [\u03b1i ], and hence\n\u03b1i = \u03be [\u03b1i ] , is constant on \u03c3.\nWe have now proved the \"only if\" direction of Lemma 4.3; we prove the \"if\"\ndirection by solving the equation \u03b7 n = \u03b1 with \u03b7\u0302 = \u03c4 under the assumption that \u03b1i\nis constant on orbits of \u03c4 . By Lemma 3.5 \u03b7i must be constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302, and\n\u03b7i must commute with \u03b1i , because \u03b7 commutes with \u03b7 n = \u03b1. If j belongs to \u03c3 then\n{j, j * \u03c4, . . . , j * \u03c4 d\u22121 } forms a complete set of \u03b1\u0302-orbit representatives for the orbit of\nj under \u03c3, so \u03b7 is completely determined on \u03c3 by \u03b7j , \u03b7j*\u03c4 , . . . , \u03b7j*\u03c4 d\u22121 .\nNow\n!n/d\nn\u22121\nd\u22121\nY\nY\n\u03b1j = (\u03b7 n )j =\n\u03b7j*\u03c4 k =\n\u03b7j*\u03c4 k\n= H n/d .\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\n\f16\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\nSuppose first that \u03b1j 6= 1. Then \u03b7j*\u03c4 k must belong to h\u03bei for all k, by Lemma 3.2,\nand therefore H is a solution to H n/d = \u03b1j in h\u03bei. This has the unique solution\nd/n\nH = \u03b1j , so \u03b7j , \u03b7j*\u03c4 , . . . , \u03b7j*\u03c4 d\u22121 are a solution to (4.1) in h\u03bei, as claimed.\nOn the other hand, if \u03b1j = 1 then the condition \u03b7i \u03b1i = \u03b1i \u03b7i places no restriction\non \u03b7i on \u03c3. H is thus a solution to H n/d = 1 in Dq,r . Now n is co-prime to r, by\nconstruction, and l is co-prime to q, by Lemma 4.1, so n/d is divisible by q but not\nby r. It follows that H must have order 1 or q, so H belongs to V .\nWe have now shown that if \u03b7 exists, then it must be as given in the Lemma.\nConversely, let O be a set of orbit representatives for \u03c4 acting on P1 (Fp ), and\nsuppose that we are given an appropriate solution to equation (4.1) or (4.2) for\neach j \u2208 O. Define \u03b7i on the rest\u0001of P1 (Fp ) by extending it to be constant on orbits\nof \u03b1\u0302, and let \u03b7 = (\u03b70 , . . . , \u03b7\u221e ), \u03c4 . Then (\u03b7 n )j = \u03b1j for each j \u2208 O, and (\u03b7 n )j*\u03c4 m\nQm\u22121\nis conjugate to (\u03b7 n )j by k=0 \u03b7j*\u03c4 k for each j and m. The conjugating element\nbelongs to the centraliser of \u03b1j , so (\u03b7 n )j*\u03c4 m = \u03b1j = \u03b1j*\u03c4 m , and we conclude that\n\u03b7 n = \u03b1. To complete the proof we note that equations (4.1) and (4.2) have rd\u22121\nand |Dq,r |d\u22121 * |V | solutions respectively, so \u03b1 does indeed have an nth root with\nshape \u03c4 under the hypothesis.\n\u0003\n4.4. The image of the longitude. We next characterise the possibilities for the\nimage of the longitude x3 , w3 of each factor knot, under the assumption that\n\u03c1(a) = \u03b1 has the form considered in Section 4.3.\nLemma 4.4. Let \u03b1 be an element of Arp in reduced standard form such that \u03b1\u0302\nis nontrivial and has an nth root in P SL(2, p). Suppose that \u03c1 : T \u2192 Hpq,r is a\nhomomorphism such that \u03c1(a) = \u03b1, and let \u03b5 = \u03c1(x3 ). If p, q and r are chosen as\nin Section 4.1 then either \u03b5 = \u03b16 , or\n(1) \u03b5\u0302 = 1;\n(2) \u03b5i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302;\n(3) the conjugacy class of \u03b5i is constant on P1 (Fp );\n6\n[[\u03b1]] for all i; and\n(4) [\u03b5i ] =\np+1\n(5) \u03b5i = \u03be 6[[\u03b1]]/(p+1) if \u03b1i 6= 1.\n\nProof. We begin by noting that \u03b5 commutes with \u03b1, because x3 generates the\ncentre of T . Let \u03c7 = \u03c1(x), \u03c8 = \u03c1(y), so that \u03b5 = \u03c73 = \u03c8 2 . Then \u03c7\u03023 = \u03c8\u0302 2 = \u03b5\u0302 in\nP SL(2, p), so by Theorem A.1 either \u03b5\u0302 = 1, or \u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 are powers of \u03c8\u0302 \u03c7\u0302\u22121 = \u03b1\u0302.\nIn the latter case \u03b5\u0302 = \u03b1\u03026 , so in either case \u03b1i is constant on orbits of \u03b5\u0302 and we may\napply Lemma 3.5. We conclude that \u03b5i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302 and commutes\nwith \u03b1i for all i. Since \u03b1i \u2208 h\u03bei for each i, it follows from Lemma 3.2 that \u03b5i is a\npower of \u03be whenever \u03b1i is nontrivial.\nThe two cases now diverge, and we treat each in turn. Suppose first that \u03c7\u0302 and\n\u03c8\u0302 are not powers of \u03b1\u0302. Then \u03b5\u0302 is the identity, and \u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 must be of orders 3 and\n2 respectively, or else they would be powers of \u03b1\u0302. Since \u03b5\u0302 = 1 we have \u03c0i (\u03b5) = \u03b5i\nfor all i, so by Lemma 3.6 the conjugacy class of \u03b5i is constant on the orbits of both\n\u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302.\nWe claim that in this case \u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 generate P SL(2, p), so that the conjugacy\nclass of \u03b5i is in fact constant on P1 (Fp ). Indeed, this is immediate from Proposition A.5 and Lemma 4.1 when 30 divides n. When 30 does not divide n the group\nP SL(2, p) is isomorphic to S3 , A4 or A5 , and h\u03c7\u0302, \u03c8\u0302i contains elements of orders 2\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n17\n\nand 3. Additional, when p = 5 it contains an element of order 5, by Lemma 4.1. It\nis easily seen that in all three cases \u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 generate P SL(2, p).\nSince the conjugacy class of \u03b5i is constant on P1 (Fp ), so is the value of [\u03b5i ]. To\nevaluate this common value we use the abelianisation Hpq,r \u2192 Z/rZ. On one hand\nwe have\nX\n[\u03b5k ] = (p + 1)[\u03b5i ],\n[[\u03b5]] =\nk\u2208P1 (Fp )\n\nand on the other we have [[\u03b5]] = 6[[\u03b1]], because a generates the abelianisation of\nT . Since p + 1 divides |P SL(2, p)|, which is co-prime to r, we may divide by p + 1\n6\nmod r to get [\u03b5i ] = p+1\n[[\u03b1]] for all i, as claimed. Statement (5) now follows from\nthis and the last sentence of the first paragraph.\nWe now turn our attention to the case where \u03c7\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 are powers of \u03b1\u0302. In this\ncase \u03c1 maps T into the subgroup Dq,r \u2240 h\u03b1\u0302i. If \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3m are the disjoint cycles of\n\u03b1\u0302, of lengths l1 , . . . , lm , then this subgroup may be regarded as a subgroup of the\ndirect product\nm\nm\nY\nY\nDq,r \u2240 h\u03c3k i =\n(Dq,r )lk \u22ca h\u03c3k i.\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nMoreover, \u03c1 may be regarded as a product of maps \u03c1k to each factor. We may\ntherefore consider each disjoint cycle separately. In what follows we will use \u03c3k to\ndenote both the cycle and the set of points of P1 (Fp ) moved by this cycle.\nSince \u03b1i and \u03b5i are constant on \u03c3k , the abelianisation [[ * ]] : Dq,r \u2240 h\u03c3k i \u2192 Z/rZ\ngives [[\u03b5|\u03c3k ]] = lk [\u03b5i ] = 6[[\u03b1|\u03c3k ]] = 6lk [\u03b1i ]. Hence [\u03b5i ] = 6[\u03b1i ] on \u03c3k , because lk is\nco-prime to r. If \u03b1i is nontrivial on \u03c3k then this equality implies\n\u03b5i = \u03be [\u03b5i ] = \u03be 6[\u03b1i ] = \u03b16i = (\u03b16 )i ,\n\nwhere the last equality uses the fact that \u03b1 is in standard form. However, if \u03b1i = 1\non \u03c3k then we may only conclude at this stage that \u03b5i \u2208 V , and we will need to\nwork a little harder to show that in fact \u03b5i = 1.\nBy way of contradiction, suppose that \u03b5i = v \u2208 V on \u03c3k , and that v is nontrivial.\nWe claim that \u03c1k maps T into the subgroup V \u2240 h\u03c3k i. To prove this we need only\nshow that the image of x lies in this subgroup, because a and x generate T . To do\nso we first note that \u03b5 is in reduced standard form, because li (\u03b5\u0302) divides li (\u03b1\u0302) for\nall i, and li (\u03b1\u0302) is co-prime to qr, by Lemma 4.1. Since \u03b5 and \u03c7 commute, and \u03b5i\nis constant on orbits of \u03c7\u0302, we may apply Lemma 3.5 to conclude that \u03c7i commutes\nwith \u03b5i for all i. On \u03c3k this means that \u03c7i \u2208 V for all i, by Lemma 3.2, and the\nclaim is proved.\nIt follows that the abelianisation k * k : V \u2240 h\u03c3k i \u2192 V given by summing \u03b2i over\n\u03c3k is defined on \u03c1k (T ). Applying this map we get\nk\u03b5|\u03c3k k = lk v = 6k\u03b1|\u03c3k k = 0.\n\nThus v is the identity afterall, because lk is co-prime to q. Consequently \u03b5i = 1 = \u03b16i\non \u03c3k , and we are done.\n\u0003\nWe refine Lemma 4.4 when [[\u03b1]] = 0:\nLemma 4.5. Let \u03b1, \u03c1, \u03b5 and p, q, r be as in Lemma 4.4, and suppose that [[\u03b1]] = 0\nbut that \u03b5 6= \u03b16 . If \u03b1i is nontrivial for some i or if p + 1 is co-prime to q then\n\u03b5 = 1.\n\n\f18\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\nProof. Since \u03b5 6= \u03b16 , \u03b5 is described by statements (1\u20135) of Lemma 4.4, and \u03b5i \u2208 V\nfor all i. If \u03b1i is nontrivial for some i then statements (5), (3) and (1) imply that\n\u03b5 = 1, and we are done. We therefore assume that \u03b1i = 1 for all i, but that \u03b5 6= 1.\nSince \u03b5i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302 and conjugate to \u03b50 for all i, there is \u03b2 \u2208 Hpq,r\nsuch that \u03b2i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302, \u03b2i \u03b5i \u03b2i\u22121 = \u03b50 for all i, and \u03b2\u0302 = 1. Define\n\u03c1\u2032 : T \u2192 Hpq,r by \u03c1\u2032 (g) = \u03b2\u03c1(g)\u03b2 \u22121 . Then \u03c1\u2032 (a) = \u03b1, but \u03c1\u2032 (x3 ) = \u03b5\u2032 , where \u03b5b\u2032 = 1\n\u2032 (x), and the argument\nand \u03b5\u2032i = \u03b50 for all i. We now have \u03b5\u2032i constant on orbits of \u03c1[\nproceeds analogously to the corresponding case in Lemma 4.4 when \u03b5\u0302 = \u03b1\u03026 . If \u03b50\nis nontrivial then Lemmas 3.5 and 3.2 show that \u03c1\u2032 maps T into V \u2240 P SL(2, p), and\nthe abelianisation gives\nk\u03b5\u2032 k = (p + 1)\u03b50 = 6k\u03b1k = 0\nin V . Thus \u03b50 is trivial afterall, because p+1 is nonzero mod q, and we are done. \u0003\nSince p 6\u2261 \u22121 mod q when 30 | n, the exceptions to Lemma 4.5 are when \u03b1i = 1\nfor all i and p = 2, q = 3; p = 3, q = 2; or p = 5, q = 2 or 3. We show that in\nthese cases \u03b5 commutes with any nth root \u03b7 of \u03b1. In each case Lemma 4.1 shows\nthat \u03b1\u0302 and \u03b7\u0302 have order p, and it is easily checked that \u03b7\u0302 must be a power of \u03b1\u0302. If\n\u03b1i = 1 for all i then Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 show that \u03b7i and \u03b5i belong to V for all i.\nIn addition, \u03b5i is constant on orbits of \u03b7\u0302, because these co-incide with the orbits of\n\u03b1\u0302. Therefore\n(\u03b7\u03b5)i = \u03b7i \u03b5i*\u03b7\u0302 = \u03b7i \u03b5i = \u03b5i \u03b7i = (\u03b5\u03b7)i ,\nand since \u03b7\u03b5\nb = \u03b7\u0302 = \u03b5\u03b7,\nb \u03b5 and \u03b7 commute, as claimed.\n\n4.5. Proof of Theorem 1.1. We now combine the results of the preceding sections\nand prove Theorem 1.1 in the following form.\nTheorem 4.6 (Theorem 1.1, refined). Let n \u2265 2 and suppose that p, q and r are\nchosen as in Section 4.1. Then\n| Hom(Gn (GK), Hpq,r )| < | Hom(Gn (SK), Hpq,r )|.\nProof. Let (\u03c1, \u03b7) be a map-root pair for GK and SK in Hpq,r . As outlined in\nSection 4.1, we first show that the orbit of (\u03c1, \u03b7) under the action of C(\u03c1(a)) contains\nat least as many compatible pairs for SK as it does for GK. In the simplest cases\nwe will do this by showing that a pair is compatible for GK if and only if it is\ncompatible for SK, but in the most important case it will be necessary to consider\nthe group action.\n\nd = 1. Since the\n4.5.1. Trivial induced maps to P SL(2, p). Suppose first that \u03c1(a)\nconjugacy class of a generates G, this implies that the induced homomorphism\n\u03c1\u0302 : G \u2192 P SL(2, p) is trivial. Thus \u03c1 may be regarded as a homomorphism G \u2192\n(Dq,r )r+1 , and as such is a product of homomorphisms G \u2192 Dq,r . Since r is coprime to 6 we have {q, r} =\n6 {2, 3}, so by Lemma 3.2 part (4) each map G \u2192 Dq,r\nfactors through Z. Consequently, the product \u03c1 : G \u2192 (Dq,r )r+1 factors through Z\nalso. We therefore have \u03c1(f ) = \u03c1(c) = \u03c1(a), so C(\u03c1(a)) fixes (\u03c1, \u03b7), and additionally\n\u03c1(x3 ) = \u03c1(w3 ) = \u03c1(a6 ). Since \u03b7 commutes with \u03b7 n = \u03c1(a), it commutes with both\n\u03c1(x3 ) and \u03c1(w3 ). Thus (\u03c1, \u03b7) is a compatible pair for both GK and SK.\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n19\n\nd 6= 1. Then by\n4.5.2.

Since C(\u03b1) = \u03b2C(\u03c1(a))\u03b2 \u22121 , and (\u03c1\u2032 , \u03b7) is compatible for GK or SK\nif and only if (\u03b2\u03c1\u2032 \u03b2 \u22121 , \u03b2\u03b7\u03b2 \u22121 ) is, it suffices to prove (I) under the assumption that\n\u03c1(a) = \u03b1. Let \u03b5 = \u03c1(x3 ), \u03b4 = \u03c1(w3 ). Then the compatibility conditions are\n\u03b5\u03b4 \u22121 \u03b7 = \u03b7\u03b5\u03b4 \u22121\n\nfor SK,\n\n\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7 = \u03b7\u03b5\u03b4\n\nfor GK,\n\nand the possible values for \u03b5 and \u03b4 are described by Lemma 4.4. We consider two\ncases, according to whether or not at least one of \u03b5, \u03b4 equals \u03b16 .\n4.5.3. Case 1: at least one of \u03b5, \u03b4 equals \u03b16 . Since this property is preserved by\nthe action of C(\u03b1), we may simply show that such a pair is compatible for GK if\nand only if it is compatible for SK. But this is immediate from the compatibility\nconditions, which may be expressed in the form\n\u03b4 \u22131 \u03b7\u03b4 \u00b11 = \u03b5\u22121 \u03b7\u03b5.\nAt least one of \u03b5 and \u03b4 commutes with \u03b7, so each compatibility condition is satisfied\nif and only if the other commutes with \u03b7 also.\n4.5.4. Case 2: \u03b5 6= \u03b16 6= \u03b4. If [[\u03b1]] = 0 then Lemma 4.5 and the paragraph that\nfollows it show that both \u03b5 and \u03b4 commute with \u03b7. Thus any such map-root pair\nis compatible for both GK and SK. In what follows we therefore assume that\n[[\u03b1]] 6= 0. By Lemma 4.3 \u03b1i is constant on orbits of \u03b7\u0302, and we consider separately\nthose cycles of \u03b7\u0302 on which \u03b1i is nontrivial and those where \u03b1i = 1.\nLet \u03c3 be a cycle of \u03b7\u0302 on which \u03b1i 6= 1, and let i belong to \u03c3.

The action of C(\u03b1) on (\u03c1, \u03b7) allows us to vary \u03b4 but not \u03b5, so we will treat\n\u03b5 as fixed and regard \u03b4 as a variable to solve for.

Since i and i * \u03b7\u0302 m belong to the same orbit of \u03b1\u0302 if and only if d | m,\nfor (4.4) to be well defined we must have \u03b4i*\u03b7\u0302d = \u03b4i , or\n!\u22121\n!\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\nY\nY\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b4i \u03b5 i =\n\u03b7i*\u03b7\u0302k\n\u03b4i \u03b5 i\n\u03b7i*\u03b7\u0302k .\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nBut the product in parentheses belongs to V , by Lemma 4.3, and likewise \u03b4i \u03b5\u22121\n\u2208V,\ni\nby Lemma 4.4, which shows that [\u03b4i \u03b5\u22121\n]\n=\n0.\nThus\nany\nsolution\nto\n(4.3)\nis\nwell\ni\ndefined on \u03c3.

Thus, by Lemma 3.2 a solution to (4.5) is well\ndefined on \u03c3 exactly when the product in parentheses is 1.\nWe next consider the action of C(\u03b1). If \u03b2 \u2208 C(\u03b1) then \u03b2\u0302 = 1, and by Lemma 3.5\n\u03b2i is constant on orbits of \u03b1\u0302, and belongs to h\u03bei whenever \u03b1i 6= 1. Conversely,\nit is easily checked that any such \u03b2 belongs to C(\u03b1). Thus, when \u03b1i = 1, the\naction of C(\u03b1) allows \u03b4i to be chosen independently within its conjugacy class\n{h \u2208 Dq,r : [h] = 6[[\u03b1]]/(p + 1)}, subject only to the condition that \u03b4i*\u03b1\u0302 = \u03b4i .\nConsequently, every solution to (4.3) or (4.5) within this conjugacy class may be\nrealised by the action of C(\u03b1) on \u03c1. Since any solution is completely determined by\nthe initial condition \u03b4i , and (4.4) and (4.6) are both conjugate to \u03b4i , there are |V |\nsuch solutions.\nIt follows from the above that compatibility of a pair (\u03c1, \u03b7) for which \u03b5 6= \u03b16 6= \u03b4\nis completely determined by the values of \u03b4i on cycles of \u03b7\u0302 where \u03b1i = 1. If there\nare no such cycles then \u03b2 *(\u03c1, \u03b7) is compatible for both SK and GK for all \u03b2 \u2208 C(\u03b1).\nOtherwise, let c be the number of such cycles, and let t be the number on which\nQd\u22121\nthe corresponding product k=0 \u03b7i*\u03b7\u0302k is trivial. Then the above discussion shows\nthat there are\nS(\u03c1, \u03b7) = [StabC(\u03b1) (\u03b4) : StabC(\u03b1) (\u03c1)] * |V |c\ncompatible pairs for SK in the orbit of (\u03c1, \u03b7), and S(\u03c1, \u03b7) compatible pairs for GK\nif t = c, and none otherwise. In each case there are at least as many compatible\npairs for SK in the orbit as there are for GK, and we have established statement (I)\nof Section 4.1.\n4.5.5. Realisation. We have now shown that\n| Hom(Gn (GK), Hpq,r )| \u2264 | Hom(Gn (SK), Hpq,r )|.\nTo show that the inequality is strict we exhibit map-root pairs (\u03c1, \u03b7) realising the\ncase above in which no pair in the orbit is compatible for GK.\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\nDefine X, Y , A in SL(2, Z) by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 \u22121\n0 \u22121\nX=\n,\nY =\n,\n1 1\n1 0\n\nA= YX\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n=\n1\n\n21\n\n\u0015\n0\n,\n1\n\nand let \u03c7\u0302, \u03c8\u0302, \u03b1\u0302 be the corresponding projections from SL(2, Z) to P SL(2, p).

First we observe that it suffices to prove the same statement with Fq replaced\nthroughout by an algebraic closure Fp . Indeed, let G be the subgroup generated by\nx and y. If there exists z \u2208 P SL(2, Fp ) such that z 2 = x and z 3 = y, then z = yx\u22121\nautomatically lies in G, hence in P SL(2, Fq ).

[3, Secs. 255, 260] If G is a finite subgroup of P GL(2, Fp ), then\none of the following holds:\n(i) G is conjugate to P GL(2, Fpm ) or P SL(2, Fpm ) for some m > 0;\n(ii) G is conjugate to a subgroup of the upper triangular matrices;\n(iii) G is isomorphic to A4 , S4 , A5 , or the dihedral group Dn of order 2n for\nsome n > 1 not divisible by p.\nWe proceed case by case.\nCase (i). By the first paragraph, we may without loss of generality assume that\nG is equal to P SL(2, Fpm ) or P GL(2, Fpm ).\nSuppose first that G = P SL(2, Fpm ). If pm = 2, 3 we can check the claim\ndirectly. If pm \u2265 4 then P SL(2, Fpm ) is a simple group. But H = hx3 i = hy 2 i is\nclearly a normal subgroup (it is invariant under conjugation by both x and y, which\ngenerate G) and it cannot be equal to G. Therefore x3 = y 2 = 1 in this case.\nNext suppose G = P GL(2, Fpm ). Again if pm = 2, 3 we check the claim directly, while if pm > 3 then the only nontrivial normal subgroup of P GL(2, Fpm ) is\nP SL(2, Fpm ) and we can proceed as in the previous paragraph.\nCase (ii). By the first paragraph we may assume that x, y are upper triangular.\nLet X, Y be lifts of x, y to GL(2, Fp ), so that X 3 \u03b7 = Y 2 for a nonzero constant \u03b7.\nMultiplying this equation through by \u03b7 2 gives (\u03b7X)3 = (\u03b7Y )2 ; replacing X, Y by\n\u03b7X, \u03b7Y , we may therefore assume that X 3 = Y 2 .\nLet X11 , Y11 be the upper left entries of X, Y respectively. Since X, Y are upper\n\u00d7\n3\n2\ntriangular we see X11\n= Y11\n. Since Fp is a direct limit of cyclic groups, there exists\n\u00d7\n\na \u2208 Fp such that X11 = a2 and Y11 = a3 . We may argue similarly for the lower\nright entries, so that X, Y have the form\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 3\n\u0013\na\n\u03bc\na\n\u03bd\nX=\n,\nY\n=\n.\n0 b2\n0 b3\nThe condition that X 3 = Y 2 is now simply the condition that their upper right\nentries are equal, which one computes to be\n(A.1)\n\n(a2 + ab + b2 )(a2 \u2212 ab + b2 )\u03bc = (a + b)(a2 \u2212 ab + b2 )\u03bd .\n\nObserve that\na6 \u2212 b6 = (a \u2212 b)(a + b)(a2 + ab + b2 )(a2 \u2212 ab + b2 ) .\nIf any of the final three factors on the right vanishes, then a6 = b6 , and moreover\nthe equality (A.1) must become 0 = 0. Therefore X 3 , Y 2 are both scalar and\nx3 = y 2 = 1.\nIf none of the final factors on the right vanishes, then we may define\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n= 2\n\u03bb=\na+b\na + ab + b2\n\n\fGENERALISED KNOT GROUPS DISTINGUISH THE SQUARE AND GRANNY KNOTS\n\n23\n\nand it is easy to check that\nX=\n\n\u0012\na\n0\n\n\u00132\n\u03bb\n,\nb\n\nY =\n\n\u0012\na\n0\n\n\u00133\n\u03bb\n.\nb\n\nHence there exists Z \u2208 GL(2, Fp ) such that X = Z 2 and Y = Z 3 , and the same is\ntrue for x, y.\nCase (iii). We consider each of the groups A4 , S4 , A5 , Dn in turn.\nSubcase G \u223c\n= A4 . The elements of A4 have the following shape:\ng2\ng3\ng\n1\n1\n1\n(1 2)(3 4)\n1\n(1 2)(3 4)\n(1 3 2)\n1\n(1 2 3)\nFrom the table, the only way a square may equal a cube is if both are the identity.\nNote that if we take x to be any 3-cycle and y to be any (2, 2)-cycle then x, y do\nindeed generate A4 .\nSubcase G \u223c\n= S4 . The elements of S4 have the following shape:\ng2\ng3\ng\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(1 2)\n(1 2)\n(1 2)(3 4)\n1\n(1 2)(3 4)\n(1 3 2)\n1\n(1 2 3)\n(1 2 3 4) (1 3)(2 4) (1 4 3 2)\nFrom the table, if x3 = y 2 then either x3 = y 2 = 1, or else y is a 4-cycle and\nx = x3 = y 2 is a (2, 2)-cycle. In the latter case we could take z = y \u22121 , but in fact\nthe latter case is ruled out as in this case x, y would not generate S4 . Note that if\nx3 = y 2 = 1 then x, y generate S4 if and only if they are simultaneously conjugate\nto x = (1 2 3), y = (1 4).\nSubcase G \u223c\n= A5 . The elements of A5 have the following shape:\ng\ng2\ng3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(1 2)(3 4)\n(1 2)(3 4)\n(1 2 3)\n(1 3 2)\n1\n(1 2 3 4 5) (1 3 5 2 4) (1 4 2 5 3)\nFrom the table, if x3 = y 2 then either x3 = y 2 = 1, or else x, y are both 5-cycles\nand x = y \u22121 . As with S4 , the latter case is ruled out by hypothesis. Note that if\nx3 = y 2 = 1 then x, y generate A5 if and only if they are simultaneously conjugate\nto y = (1 2)(3 4), x = (1 3 5).\n\n\f24\n\nCHRISTOPHER TUFFLEY\n\nSubcase G \u223c\n= Dn . Recall that the group Dn has presentation\nhr, s | s2 = rn = 1 , sr = r\u22121 si .\n\nSince x, y generate Dn and x3 = y 2 , it is easily checked that y = srl for some l\nand x3 = y 2 = 1. Note that in this case x, y generate a group of order 6, so the\nonly possibility for n is n = 3. Moreover, S3 is generated by any element of order\n3 together with any element of order 2.\n\u0003\nRemark A.3. In case (ii) we can actually say somewhat more, namely that as long\nas a2 \u2212 ab + b2 6= 0 then we are always in the abelian case (i.e., there exists z such\nthat x = z 2 and y = z 3 ). It remains only to check this claim when either a + b\nor a2 + ab + b2 is zero. Note that not both can be zero, or else ab = (a + b)2 \u2212\n(a2 + ab + b2 ) = 0, which is impossible. If, for instance, a + b = 0, then \u03bc = 0 in\nequation (A.1). We may still define \u03bb = \u03bd/(a2 + ab + b2 ) and check that\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00133\na \u03bb\na \u03bb\nX=\n,\nY =\n.\n0 b\n0 b\nThe case a2 + ab + b2 is analogous.\n\nRemark A.4. The final sentence of each subcase of case (iii) shows that whenever\none finds S3 , A4 , S4 , or A5 as a subgroup of P SL(2, Fq ), it is possible to choose\nx, y that generate this subgroup and satisfy x3 = y 2 = 1.\nProposition A.5. Suppose x, y \u2208 P SL(2, Fp ) satisfy x3 = y 2 . If there does not\nexist z \u2208 P SL(2, Fp ) such that x = z 2 and y = z 3 , and if ord(yx\u22121 ) > 6, then\nhx, yi = P SL(2, Fp ); in particular this group acts transitively on P1 (Fp ).\n\nProof. By Theorem A.1 we have x3 = y 2 = 1. Let G = hx, yi. If we are in case (ii)\nof Dickson's theorem, then by Remark A.3 we have a2 \u2212 ab + b2 = 0. Then a/b is\na primitive 6th root of unity (note that the hypotheses of this Proposition imply\np 6= 2, 3) and the order of yx\u22121 is 6, contrary to hypothesis. Similarly, if we are in\nany of the subcases of case (iii), then the possible cycle types of x, y are spelled out\nin the proof of Theorem A.1, and one checks in each case that the order of yx\u22121 is\nat most 5.\nTherefore we are in case (i), and G is conjugate to P GL(2, Fpm ) or P SL(2, Fpm ).\nBut G is a subgroup of P SL(2, Fp ) and certainly cannot have order larger than the\norder of P SL(2, Fp ). We conclude that G = P SL(2, Fp).\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement\nChristopher Tuffley thanks David Savitt for providing the results on P SL(2, p)\nin the Appendix, and for other helpful discussions about P SL(2, p).\nReferences\n[1] J.
