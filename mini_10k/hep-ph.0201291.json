If neutrinos have\na 'normal hierarchy' we get the 90% CL range |mee | = (0.7 \u00f7 4.6) meV, and discuss in\nwhich cases future experiments can test this possibility. For 'inverse hierarchy', we get\n|mee | = (12 \u00f7 57) meV and m\u03bde = (40 \u00f7 57) meV. The 0\u03bd2\u03b2 data imply that almost\ndegenerate neutrinos are lighter than 1.05 h eV at 90% CL (h \u223c 1 parameterizes nuclear\nuncertainties), competitive with the \u03b2-decay bound. We critically reanalyse the data\nthat were recently used to claim an evidence for 0\u03bd2\u03b2, and discuss their implications.\nFinally, we review the predictions of flavour models for mee and \u03b813 .\nThe most successful extensions of the SM to date suggest that neutrinos are Majorana particles, with\nmasses around v 2 /MGUT \u223c meV, where v = 174 GeV (the electroweak scale) and MGUT \u223c 2 * 1016\nGeV (the grand unification scale). If this indication is correct, the goal of future neutrino experiments\nwill be the reconstruction of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix, namely the measurement of 3 masses,\n3 mixing angles and 3 CP-violating phases. Within this framework, data on solar and atmospheric\nneutrinos [1, 2, 3] are interpreted as pieces of evidence for effects due to 2 mixing angles and 2 squared\nmass differences, and the LSND anomaly [4] cannot be explained. We are far from knowing all 9 neutrino\nparameters. Furthermore, only 6 of them might be measured by oscillations; thus, we will eventually\nneed \"non-oscillation\" experiments to access the remaining ones. In this work, we discuss how future\nstudy of neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u03bd2\u03b2) and tritium end-point spectrum (\u03b2) could contribute\nto this goal. In particular, we carefully study the expected signals for these experiments on the basis\nof our present knowledge. We follow two different strategies of investigation: we first pursue a purely\nphenomenological approach, and next we add speculative ingredients from models of quark and lepton\nmasses. In our view, neither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory: the first one allows us to derive\nsafe but not extremely strong restrictions; the second one can give stronger but unsafe restrictions.\nTherefore these two approaches are \"complementary\".\nIn section 1 we obtain the ranges of parameters measured by oscillation experiments, and summarize\nhow future experiments are expected to improve on these quantities. In section 2 we work out the\nconnections between oscillation and non-oscillation (\u03b2 and 0\u03bd2\u03b2-decay) experiments. We improve on\n1\n\nIn the addendum at pages 25\u201327 we update our results including the first KamLAND data. In the addendum at pages\n28\u201330 we update our results including the 'salt' SNO data.\n\u2020\nOn leave from dipartimento di Fisica dell'Universit\u00e0 di Pisa and INFN.\n\n1\n\n\fearlier similar works, by combining these considerations with the existing oscillation data by means\nof appropriate statistical techniques. In this way, we determine the precise ranges of \u03b2 and 0\u03bd2\u03b2decay signals expected on the basis of present oscillation data, for allowed neutrino mass spectra. In\nthe case of almost degenerate neutrinos, we also compute the upper bound on the common Majorana\nneutrino mass implied by present 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments. An evidence for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 has been claimed in a recent\npaper [5]. In the appendix we critically reanalyse the data that should contain such evidence and discuss\ntheir implications. In section 3 we review the expected values of mee and \u03b813 (the two still unknown\nparameters with brighter future experimental prospects) in large families of flavour models discussed in\nthe literature. Our results are summarized in section 4.\n\n1\n\nOscillation experiments\n\nThe three-flavour Majorana neutrino mass matrix mll\u2032 (where l, l\u2032 = {e, \u03bc, \u03c4 }) is described by 9 real\nparameters. It is convenient to choose them to be the 3 real positive masses mi and parameterize the\nneutrino mixing matrix V (that relates the fields with given flavour to those with given mass, \u03bdl = Vli \u03bdi )\nas\nV = R23 (\u03b823 ) * diag (1, ei\u03c6 , 1) * R13 (\u03b813 ) * R12 (\u03b812 ) * diag (1, ei\u03b1 , ei\u03b2 )\n(1)\nwhere Rij (\u03b8ij ) represents a rotation by \u03b8ij in the ij plane and i, j = {1, 2, 3}. The CP-violating phase \u03c6\ninduces no physical effects if \u03b813 = 0. Similarly, also \u03b1 and \u03b2 induce physical effects only in presence of\nflavour mixing, but we found no simple way of presenting the necessary conditions in terms of the above\nparametrization.\nWe order the neutrino masses mi such that m3 is the most splitted state and m2 > m1 , and define\n\u2206m2ij = m2j \u2212 m2i . With this choice, \u2206m223 and \u03b823 are the 'atmospheric parameters' and \u2206m212 > 0\nand \u03b812 are the 'solar parameters', whatever the spectrum of neutrinos ('normal hierarchy' i.e. m1 \u226a\n2\nm2 \u226a m3 so that \u2206m223 > 0; 'inverted hierarchy' i.e. m3 \u226a m1 <\n\u223c m2 , so that \u2206m23 < 0 or 'almost\ndegenerate').\n\n1.1\n\nPresent situation\n\nAlmost all present experimental information on the 9 neutrino parameters comes from oscillation experiments [1, 2, 3], and can be summarized as\n|\u2206m223 |1/2 \u223c 50 meV,\n\n(\u2206m221 )1/2 \u223c (0.03 \u00f7 25) meV,\n\n\u03b812 \u223c \u03b823 \u223c 1,\n\n\u03b813 <\n\u223c 1/4,\n\n\u03c6 \u223c (0 \u00f7 2\u03c0) (2)\n\nand more precisely in fig. 1, obtained from our up-to date fits of solar, atmospheric and reactor data.\nDetails on how our fits have been performed can be found in [6, 7]. The atmospheric mixing angle \u03b823\nand the solar mixing angle \u03b812 have to be large (indeed, it looks as if the first is almost maximal, while\nthe second may be just 'large'); the Chooz experiment implies that the third mixing \u03b813 cannot be\nthat large. The solar mass splitting, \u2206m212 , could be slightly or much smaller than the atmospheric one,\n|\u2206m223 |. Nothing is known on \u03c6.\nA brief comment about statistics could help in better interpreting our results. In fig. 1 and in the rest\nof the paper we plot \u2206\u03c72 (p) \u2261 \u03c72 (p) \u2212 \u03c72best fit , where p is the quantity in which we are interested; \u03c72 (p)\nis usually obtained from a multi-parameter fit, as \u03c72 (p) = minp\u2032 \u03c72 (p, p\u2032 ), where p\u2032 are other parameters\nin which we are not interested. For example, a fit of atmospheric data gives \u03c72 (\u2206m223 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 ), from\nwhich we obtain the functions \u2206\u03c72 (\u2206m223 ) and \u2206\u03c72 (\u03b823 ), plotted in figs. 1a and 1b respectively. It\nis important to appreciate that, when a quantity is extracted in this way from a multi-parameter fit,\nthere is no loss of statistical power due to the presence of other parameters. In fact, with some technical\nassumptions (e.g. the Gaussian approximation2 ) one can derive the following two equivalent results:\n2\n\nWhen extracting the oscillation parameters from present data, only in one case this assumption is not sufficiently well\nrealized in practice. For simple physical reasons the Beryllium contribution to solar neutrino rates depends in very strong\noscillatory way on \u2206m212 , for \u2206m212 \u223c 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u221210 eV2 (see fig. 1a).

However, we recall here the origin of these bounds.

This is somehow\nsmaller than the value suggested by supernova simulations in absence of oscillations, E\u03bd\u0304e \u223c 15 MeV. For\nboth figures it is difficult to properly assign errors; but oscillations that convert \u03bd\u0304e \u2194 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 increase\nthe disagreement, since supernova simulations suggest E\u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 \u223c 25 MeV. With an inverted hierarchy,\n\u25e6\n\u03b813 >\n\u223c 1 gives rise to adiabatic MSW conversion, swapping \u03bd\u0304e \u2194 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 completely. This is why this case\nis 'disfavoured' if the predictions of supernova models on neutrino energy and flux are correct. The\nsame argument applies to large solar mixing angles: \u03b812 \u223c 1 induces a partial swap of the \u03bd\u0304e into \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 ,\nwhatever the mass spectrum of neutrinos. LMA oscillations have a smaller \u03b812 and a larger \u2206m212 than\nLOW and (Q)VO, and are therefore less 'disfavoured'. SMA gives almost no \u03bd\u0304e oscillations, but is\nstrongly disfavoured by solar data. For a full analysis, see [10].\n\n1.2\n\nPerspectives of improvement\n\nFuture oscillation experiments can significantly improve the situation. Concerning the 'solar' parameters,\nSNO, KamLAND and Borexino can reduce the error on sin2 2\u03b812 down to around 5%, and measure \u2206m212\nto few per-mille (if it lies in the VO or QVO regions), or few per-cent (in the LMA region), or around 10%\n(in the LOW region) [11].3 Concerning the 'atmospheric' parameters, K2K, Minos or CNGS can reduce\nthe error on |\u2206m223 | and sin2 2\u03b823 down to about 10% and discover \u03b813 if larger than few degrees [13, 14]\n(the precise value strongly depends on |\u2206m223 |). Far future long-baseline experiments can reduce the error\non |\u2206m223 | and sin2 2\u03b823 down to few % (with a conventional beam [15]) and maybe 1% (with a neutrino\nfactory beam [16]). These experiments could also discover a \u03b813 larger than 0.5\u25e6 and tell something\nobtained from a full Bayesian analysis, performed assuming a flat prior in ln \u2206m212 along the lines of [6, 8]. Only in this\ncase, and only around \u03b812 \u223c 1, there is some difference between a Bayesian result and the Gaussian approximation, and we\nuse the Bayesian result.\n3\n\u22124\nIf \u2206m212 >\na new reactor experiment with a shorter baseline than KamLAND would be necessary [11, 12]. If\n\u223c 2 10\n\u2206m212 \u2248 10\u22128 eV2 Borexino and KamLAND will not see a inequivocable signal.\n\n3\n\n\fabout \u03c6, if LMA is the true solution of the solar neutrino problem. Future reactor experiments [17] can\n\u25e6\nbe sensitive to a \u03b813 >\n\u223c3 .\nIf a non zero \u03b813 will be discovered, earth matter corrections to \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e will tell the\nsign of \u2206m223 [18] (i.e. if the atmospheric anomaly is due to the lightest or heaviest neutrinos). The sign\nof \u03b823 \u2212 45\u25e6 (which tells whether the neutrino state with mass m3 contains more \u03bd\u03c4 or more \u03bd\u03bc ) can be\nmeasured by comparing\nP (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) = 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b813 sin2\n\n\u2206m223 L\n4E\u03bd\n\nwith\n\nP (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) = sin2 \u03b823 * [1 \u2212 P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde )]\n\n(even including matter effects in P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ), the issue on \u03b823 remains). Note that muon disappearance\nexperiments alone cannot distinguish \u03b823 from 90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b823 , and that the present bound sin2 2\u03b823 >\n\u223c 0.95 [1]\n2\n2 is in the upper part of the LMA region,\n<\nallows the relatively loose range 1/3 <\nsin\n\u03b8\n2/3.\nIf\n\u2206m\n23 \u223c\n12\n\u223c\nso that it affects long-baseline experiments, the sign of \u03b823 \u2212 45\u25e6 can be measured even if \u03b813 = 0.\nWe can summarize the content of this section by saying that we can confidently include among the\nknown parameters |\u2206m223 |, \u03b823 , \u03b812 , and we have reasonably good perspectives for \u2206m212 , \u03b813 , sign(\u2206m223 ),\n\u03b823 \u2212 45\u25e6 , \u03c6 (we express our expectations by the order of quotation; however, effects due to \u03b813 or \u03c6\ncould be too small to be ever observed).\n\n2\n\nNon-oscillation experiments\n\nOscillation experiments cannot access to 3 of the 9 parameters of the Majorana mass matrix: the overall\nneutrino scale, and the two CP-violating \"Majorana phases\" denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2 in eq. (1) [19]. Indeed,\nthe neutrino mass matrix enters as m\u2020 m in the Hamiltonian of propagation of ultrarelativistic neutrinos.\nNon oscillation experiments are needed to probe the full neutrino mass matrix [20]. For definiteness, we\nfocus the discussion on \u03b2-decay tritium experiments [21] and 0\u03bd2\u03b2-decay germanium experiments [22],\nthat seem to have the best chances of reaching the necessary sensitivity. These techniques are among the\noldest and better established. We will not discuss different techniques that at present are not competitive,\nthough they have certain advantages. For instance calorimetric measurements [23] are not limited to\nthe end-point of \u03b2 spectrum. Search of 0\u03bd2\u03b2 with other nuclear species could allow to reduce nuclear\ntheoretical uncertainties [24].\nBefore continuing, we recall other possibilities to investigate the mass of neutrinos offered by the\nastrophysics and the cosmology:\n\u2022 At the next gravitational collapse of a supernova, the general strategy [25] will consist in identifying structures in the time and/or energy distributions of neutrinos sensitive to neutrino masses,\nas the neutronization peak, the rising (or falling) ramp of the cooling phase, a hypothetical sharp\ncutoff due to black hole formation. The sensitivity of these approaches has been quantified in\nseveral works, assuming the capabilities of present detectors (SuperKamiokande, SNO, LVD,. . . ).\nThe difference in time of flight between neutrinos and gravitons will only be sensitive to neutrinos\nheavier than about 1 eV [26], comparable to present \u03b2-decay bounds. The difference in time of\nflight between different neutrinos will only be sensitive to neutrino mass differences larger than few\n10 eV [27]. If neutrino emission were suddenly terminated by black hole formation, a measurement\nof the difference in time of flight between neutrinos of different energy will only be sensitive to\nneutrino masses larger than few eV [28].\n\u2022 Information on neutrino masses might also be obtained from data on large scale structures\nin the universe, together with very accurate measurements of anisotropies in the temperature\nof thePcosmic background radiation. It is thought that it is possible to improve on the present\nlimit \u03bd m\u03bd <\n\u223c (5 \u00f7 10) eV down to about \u223c 0.3 eV [29] (the precise value depends on uncertain\ncosmological parameters). However, even if an effect due to neutrino masses will be detected, it will\nbe difficult to ascertain that it is really due to neutrino masses, rather than to other mechanisms\nthat could produce similar effects. Cosmology has better sensitivity than other experiments to\nheavy sterile neutrinos.\n4\n\n\f3\n2\n\nh\n\n1\n0 '86 '84 '91 '89 '90 '89 '91 '98 '84 '92 '96 '92 '91 '92 '97 '96 '88 '95 '96\n\nFigure 2: We parameterize by h the theoretical uncertainty on the inferences of |mee | from the data due\nto the disagreement among different calculations of nuclear matrix elements (see eq. (3) and discussion\ntherein). In the horizontal scale, the year of the calculation. Compiled from [32].\n\u2022 The 'Z burst' [30] is a possible source of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray events observed above\nthe Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff [31]. A cosmic ray neutrino that scatters with a\nnonrelativistic cosmic microwave background neutrino encounters the Z resonance at the energy\nE\u03bdres = MZ2 /2m\u03bd , that is slightly above the optimal value even if neutrinos are as heavy as possible: m\u03bd = 1 eV gives E\u03bdres = 4 \u00d7 1021 eV. It seems difficult to imagine a cosmological source that\nproduces enough energetic neutrinos without producing, at the same time, too many photons [30].\n\n2.1\n\n\u03b2-decay and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments\n\nPresent \u03b2-decay experiments (\"direct mass search\") and neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay (0\u03bd2\u03b2) experiments\ngive bounds on combinations of entries of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix mll\u2032 . Such bounds are\nsomewhat above the mass scale suggested by oscillations: at 95% CL\nm\u03bde \u2261 (m\u2020 m)1/2\nee < 2.2 eV from \u03b2-decay [33]\n\nand\n\n|mee | < 0.38h eV from 0\u03bd2\u03b2 [34].\n\n(3)\n\nHere h \u2261 M0 /M is the inverse of the nuclear matrix element M for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 of 76 Ge, normalized to a\nreference matrix element M0 , chosen to be the one of ref. [35]. 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments try to measure (or\nbound) |mee | by measuring the rate of the transition \u0393(76 Ge \u219276 Se 2\u03b2) = \u03a6 * M 2 * |m2ee |, where \u03a6\nis a phase space factor. Any uncertainty on the nuclear matrix element M reflects directly on the\nmeasurement of |mee |. Indeed, different calculations find rather different nuclear matrix elements, as\nshown in fig. 2, that suggests the range h = 0.6 \u00f7 2.8. We will not attempt to assign an error on M .\nRather, we always include an explicit factor h whenever we quote an experimental result on 0\u03bd2\u03b2, as we\ndo in eq. (3).\nThe result of the Heidelberg\u2013Moscow experiment at Gran Sasso (HM) quoted above [34] was obtained\nby selecting a certain search window, and comparing the n = 21 events occurring there with the b =\n20.4 \u00b1 1.6 expected background events. Knowing that mee = 350 meV would yield s = 9.3/h2 signal\nevents, from the Poissonian probability of measuring s + b events one obtains the likelihood for mee ,\nL \u221d e\u2212s (1 + s/b)n .\nThe result of the Mainz collaboration [33] quoted above is in agreement with Troitsk results [36],\nthough the \u03b2 spectrum of this last experiment presents some unexpected features. Anyhow, this limit\nis rather close to the sensitivity of these setups, \u223c 2 eV, so that new experiments are certainly needed\nto progress. Indeed, there are plans to extend the sensitivities of \u03b2 and especially 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments to\nmass scales closer to those suggested by oscillations, shown in eq. (2):\nm\u03bde \u2192 300 meV,\n\n|mee | \u2192 10h meV.\n\n(4)\n\nWe refer here to the proposals of the collaborations Katrin [37] for \u03b2-decay and Genius [38] for\n0\u03bd2\u03b2-decay, that evolve from the experiments mentioned above. There is also another proposal (named\n5\n\n\fMajorana) [39] to improve on 0\u03bd2\u03b2 with 76 Ge, which evolves from the second most powerful experiment,\nIGEX [40]. The estimated sensitivity is several times weaker than what the Genius experiment would\nlike to achieve. There is also another interesting proposal named GEM [41].\nOne should note that in eq.s (3) and (4) we suggest that \u03b2-decay experiments will at best extract\na single parameter, m\u03bde . This is the case of the three neutrino scenario considered here, for the mass\nsplittings suggested by oscillations are too little to be resolved by any experiment till now proposed.4 For\nexample the energy resolution of Katrin will be more than one order of magnitude larger than the scales\nin eq. (2) [44]. Only if neutrinos have an almost degenerate spectrum the \u03b2-decay experiments mentioned\nhere could see neutrino masses. We will consider this case closely in section 2.5 (for a discussion of related\nmatter, and more general possibilities, see [42, 43]).\n\n2.2\n\nHow to use the inputs from oscillations?\n\nThe connection of oscillations with \u03b2 and 0\u03bd2\u03b2-decay has been explored in a number of works [45, 46,\n47, 42, 43].5 The quantities probed by \u03b2 and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments can be written in terms of the masses\nmi , of the mixing angles \u03b8ij and of the CP-violating phases \u03b1 and \u03b2 as\nm\u03bd e =\n\n\u0012X\ni\n\n|mee | =\n\nX\n\n|Vei2 |\n\nm2i\n\n\u00131/2\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ncos\n\n2\n\n\u03b813 (m21 cos2 \u03b812\n\n+\n\nm22 sin2 \u03b812 ) +\n\nm23 sin2 \u03b813\n\n\u00131/2\n\nVei2 mi = cos2 \u03b813 (m1 cos2 \u03b812 + m2 e2i\u03b1 sin2 \u03b812 ) + m3 e2i\u03b2 sin2 \u03b813 .\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\ni\n\nIn both formulae, we can identify the 3 individual contributions associated with the 3 masses mi . It is\nuseful to make few general remarks:\n1. m\u03bde depends on oscillation parameters and on the overall neutrino mass scale, while mee is also\nsensitive to the Majorana phases.\n2. The m2 -contributions to m\u03bde and mee are guaranteed to be non-zero (for inverted spectrum the\nsame is true for the m1 -contribution).\n3. Since |Vei | \u2264 1, the mixing factors suppress more strongly the mi -contributions to mee than those\n2 \u2248 1/3 we have a m -contribution to m\nto m\u03bde . For example, at the best-fit LMA solution Ve2\n2\n\u03bde\n70% larger than the one to mee . This is even more evident is the hierarchical case, when the\nm3 -contributions are suppressed by the small angle \u03b813 .\n4. Let us denote as mmin the lightest neutrino mass: mmin = m1 (mmin = m3 ) in the case of normal\n(inverted) hierarchy. Increasing m2min increases m2\u03bde by the same amount, and m\u03bde is always larger\nthan mmin . Instead, the behaviour of mee as a function of mmin is less simple, especially when the\nindividual contributions become comparable in size.\n4\n\nWe approximate the exact formula for the \u03b2-decay spectrum close to end-point in presence of mixed neutrinos in terms\nof a single effective neutrino mass parameter [33] m2\u03bde \u2261 |Vei2 |m2i as\n\nX 2\ndN\n|Vei | \u0393(mi ) \u2248 \u0393(m\u03bde )\n\u221d\ndE\u03bd\n\nwhere\n\ni\n\np\n\n\u0393(m) \u2261 E\u03bd Re\n\nE\u03bd2 \u2212 m2i .\n\n(the measured electron energy in the 3 H \u21923 He e \u03bd\u0304e , decay is related to E\u03bd by kinematics). This approximation is trivially\na good one if neutrinos are almost degenerate. However, its usefulness is more general [42], since: (1) the difference between\nthe approximated and exact spectrum, integrated around the end-point, vanishes at order O(m2i ) (this is interesting for\nend-point search of neutrino mass with limited energy resolution); (2) far from the end-point, the difference is zero at order\nO(m2i ) (this is interesting for calorimetric search of neutrino mass). These properties do not hold for other definitions of\nthe 'effective mass', say m\u2032\u03bde = |Vei |2 * mi [43]. However, if a future \u03b2 decay experiment will attain a very high sensitivity,\nand at the same time will be able to resolve the separation between the mass levels, it will be necessary to introduce more\nparameters to describe the measured \u03b2 spectrum, and it will be possible to extract more interesting information.\n5\nIt is commonly assumed that the dominant contribution to 0\u03bd2\u03b2 comes from massive neutrinos. We remark that, even\nwith this assumption there might be surprises: e.g. if CPT is violated, the rate of double \u03b2-transition could be different from\nthat of double \u03b2 + , or the \u03b2 \u2212 absorption (EC) followed by \u03b2 + emission. However, we will not consider these possibilities.\n\n6\n\n\f10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 29\n\n\u2206m 223 in eV2\n\n\u2206m 212 in eV2\n\n=\n\nV\n\nm\n1\n\nee\n\nm\n\neV\n\n=\n\n4\n\neV\n8m\n\n4\n\n8m\ne\n\nm\n\nee\n\n=\n\n=\n\nm ee\n\ne\n\neV\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n5\n\nme\n\nm\n\neV\n4m\n\n2\n\n=\n\n=\n\nm ee\n\nee\n\nmeV\n= 2\n\n6\n\nm\n\nm ee\n\n1 meV\nmee =\n.5 meV\nmee = 0\n\n8\n7\n\n3\n\n2\n\nme\n\nV\n\nm\n\nee\n\n=\n\n0.\n\n5\n\n10\u2212 5\n10\u2212 1\n\n10\u2212 39\n\nm\n\neV\n\n8\n\n1\n\n0\n\ntan2 \u03b812\n\n5\n\n10\n\u03b813 in degree\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 3: Contour lines of the 'solar' and 'atmospheric' contributions to mee in the case of normal\nhierarchy (m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 ), superimposed to the regions allowed at 68, 90, 99% CL by oscillation data.\n5. Most importantly, while the contributions to m\u03bde are all positive, the individual contributions to\nmee may compensate each other for certain values of the Majorana phases.\nLet us elaborate on the last point, enlarging the theoretical perspective. One should realize that we\ncannot even invoke 'naturalness' to argue that mee should not be much smaller than its individual mi contributions [48]. In fact, from a top/down point of view the ee element of the neutrino mass matrix\nis a very simple object: some flavour symmetry could easily force a small mee , giving rise to apparently\nunnatural cancellations when mee is written in terms of the low energy parameters mi and \u03b8ij , as in\neq. (6).6 A small mee is stable under quantum corrections, that renormalize it multiplicatively. For\nthese reasons, bottom/up oscillation analyses that try to determine the range of mee consistent with\noscillation data must consider seriously the most pessimistic case. As discussed in [49] naturalness\nconsiderations would be automatically incorporated in a Bayesian analysis (i.e. no need to invent 'finetuning parameters') if we assumed any almost flat prior probability distribution for the phenomenological\nparameters (the neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phases). This is why in this work we\nstick to the Gaussian approximation.\nThe expression of |mee | minimized in the Majorana phases \u03b1 and \u03b2 was given in [46]. In this work, we\nwill use it, together with the inputs from oscillations, to infer the signals expected in 0\u03bd2\u03b2 and \u03b2-decay\nexperiments in a number of interesting limiting cases, namely: normal hierarchy, inverted hierarchy,\nalmost degenerate neutrinos. In the first two cases (sections 2.3 and 2.4), we will further show the\nexpression of |mee | which results from further minimization in the lightest neutrino mass mmin ; this is\nuseful to discuss why (with present data) we cannot exclude the possibility mee = 0, even if neutrinos\nhave Majorana masses and oscillate.\n6\nAn analogous remark holds in supersymmetric see-saw models, that generate \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 (and other) decay amplitudes\napproximately proportional to the e\u03bc element of the squared neutrino Yukawa matrix. Even in this case a flavour symmetry\nthat demands a small e\u03bc element would give rise to apparently unnatural cancellations, when \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is written in terms\nof low energy parameters.\n\n7\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\ne\n\nmaximal mee\n\nmin\nima\nlm\ne\n\n8\n\nsolar\n\natmospheric\n\n10\n\n99 % CL\n\n6\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n90 % CL\n\n90 % CL\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n99 % CL\n\n0\n3\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n3\n\n10\u2212 3\nmee in eV\n\n3\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n10\u2212 2\n\nmee in eV\n\nFigure 4: In the case of normal hierarchy (m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 ), we show the present experimental information on the solar and atmospheric contributions to mee (fig. 4a) and on |mee | itself (fig. 4b).\n\n2.3\n\nNormal hierarchy\n\n2 1/2 \u226a m \u2248 (\u2206m2 )1/2 we could be sure\nIf neutrino masses have a partial hierarchy m1 <\n3\n23\n\u223c m2 \u2248 (\u2206m12 )\nthat mee is non-zero:\n2\n|mee | > (\u2212\u2206m212 cos 2\u03b812 )1/2 \u2212 \u03b813\n(\u2206m223 )1/2\n(7)\n\n(up to higher orders in \u03b813 and \u2206m212 /\u2206m223 , and barring other possibilities already excluded by oscillation data) only if the following conditions hold\n\u03b812\n\n\u03c0\n>\n4\n\nand\n\n\u03b813\n\n\u2206m212\ncos 2\u03b812\n< \u2212\n\u2206m223\n\u0014\n\n\u00151/4\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThus, there is no warranty to have a detectable value of mee , since solar data allow \u03b812 > \u03c0/4 at a\nreasonable confidence level only in the LOW and (Q)VO solutions, where \u2206m212 is too small to give a\ndetectable contribution to mee . The minimal guaranteed mee is always smaller than the 'solar' mass\nscale (\u2206m212 )1/2 .\nWe now specialize our discussion to the case of 'normal hierarchy' m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 . As discussed\nin section 3.1 this case naturally arises in see-saw models, even in presence of large mixing angles. A\nnegligible m1 is a prediction of those see-saw models where only 2 right-handed neutrinos give a significant\ncontribution to mll\u2032 .\nThe crucial question is: can this prediction be practically tested? Non-oscillation 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments\ncan do that, provided that the 'solar' and the 'atmospheric' contributions to mee are not comparable [46].\nIn fact, we have\nq\n\n|mee | = |\n\n\u2206m212 sin2 \u03b812 cos2 \u03b813 e2i\u03b1\n\n+\n\nq\n\n2i(\u03b2\u2212\u03b1) atm\n\u2206m223 sin2 \u03b813 e2i\u03b2 | \u2261 |msun\nmee |\nee + e\n\nCP-violating phases enter through the combination \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1. Therefore, if oscillation experiments will tell\natm\nthat msun\nee \u226b mee , this sub-class of see-saw models will imply that |mee | is in the narrow range\natm\nsun\natm\nmsun\nee \u2212 mee \u2264 |mee | \u2264 mee + mee\nsun\nAn analogous prediction is possible in the opposite eventuality, matm\nee \u226b mee : in this case |mee | would\nbe approximately equal to matm\nee .\nWhat present oscillation data tell us on these eventualities? The answer is illustrated in fig. 3, where\nwe show the values of these two contributions in the regions of parameters compatible with solar and\natmospheric neutrino oscillations. From these results (and applying the statistical procedure described\n\n8\n\n\fin section 1) we extract the \u03c72 distributions of the solar and atmospheric contributions to mee plotted\nin fig. 4a. We see that the largest contribution allowed by data is the solar one: if LMA is the solution\nof the solar anomaly, solar data suggest a msun\nee in the 99% CL range 1 \u00f7 10 meV. The Chooz bound\non \u03b813 , together with the SuperKamiokande measurement of \u2206m223 , give the 99% CL upper bound\n<\nmatm\nee \u223c 3 meV. Therefore the atmospheric contribution alone is too small for giving a signal in planned\nsun\nexperiments. The dominant upper bound on both parameters matm\nee and mee (rightmost lines in fig. 4a)\n2\nis provided by Chooz, that excludes large \u03b813 and large \u2206m12 .\nIn fig. 4b we show the probability distribution of |mee | (thick line), taking into account our ignorance\non the CP-violating phase \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2. The dashed lines also show the probability distribution of |mee | in the\nspecial cases of maximal (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0) and minimal (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 = \u03c0/2) interference between the atmospheric\nand solar contributions.\nAssuming Majorana neutrinos with normal hierarchy, |mee | is well predicted and large enough to be\nmeasured in forthcoming 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments in two eventualities:\n1. \u03b813 is somewhat below the Chooz bound and \u2206m212 is in the upper part of the LMA region;\n2. \u03b813 is around the Chooz bound, and \u2206m212 is not in LMA region.\nIn the first case it will be possible to test, and eventually exclude, the sub-class of models that predict\nm1 \u226a m2 (the accuracy of this test will be limited by the theoretical uncertainty on the nuclear matrix\nelement relevant for the 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay). In the second case the actual value of m1 is irrelevant even if\nm1 \u223c m2 \u223c (\u2206m212 )1/2 ; however, the case favored by the data is the first one.\nAccording to present data, 'solar' and 'atmospheric' contributions to mee can be comparable and\nsizable. In this case, what we will learn from a future very sensitive 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiment?\n\u2022 A measurement of |mee | would be equivalent to a measurement of the Majorana CP-violating phase\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2, if oscillation parameters are known.\n\u2022 A strong upper bound on |meeq\n| would suggest \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2248 \u03c0/2 and a correlation between oscillation\n2\natm\n2\nparameters: tan \u03b813 \u2248 sin \u03b812 \u2206m212 /\u2206m223 (or that both msun\nee and mee are negligibly small).\n\nConcerning \u03b2-decay, the range for m\u03bde is (3 \u00f7 10) meV at 90% CL and (2.8 \u00f7 12) meV at 99% CL (a\nnegligible m\u03bde can be obtained in the LOW solution with a small \u03b813 ). The largest contribution to m\u03bde\ncould be the one associated with atmospheric oscillations without contradicting present data (see remark\n3 at page 6), but would remain too small to give any detectable effects in planned \u03b2-decay experiments.\n\n2.4\n\nInverted hierarchy\n\nIn our notation 'inverted hierarchy' means m3 \u226a m1 \u2248 m2 \u2248 (\u2206m232 )1/2 , with m1 and m2 separated by\nthe 'solar' mass splitting.

The condition on \u03b812 is satisfied by best fit LMA oscillations.\n\u25e6\nFurthermore, as discussed in section 1, SN1987A data could prefer a small \u03b813 <\n\u223c 1 for inverted hierarchy.\n2\n2\nAssuming a negligible \u03b813 and \u2206m12 \u226a |\u2206m23 |, the situation is illustrated in fig. 5, where we\nplot contour lines of the minimal value of mee (obtained for \u03b1 = \u03c0/2) and of the maximal value of\nmee (obtained for \u03b1 = 0 and equal to m\u03bde ) superimposed to the 68, 90, 99% CL confidence regions for\nthe solar mixing angle and for the atmospheric mass difference. A cancellation in mee is possible for\ntan \u03b812 \u2248 1: such values of \u03b812 would be strongly disfavoured if we could restrict our analysis to the\nLMA solution of the solar neutrino anomaly.\nApplying the statistical procedure described in section 1, we extract the \u03c72 distributions of mee and\nm\u03bde . The result is shown in fig. 6: oscillation data suggest a m\u03bde in the 90% CL range (40 \u00f7 57) meV and\na |mee | in the 90% CL range (12 \u00f7 57) meV. However a much smaller |mee | can be obtained at slighly\nhigher CL from patterns of solar oscillations (mainly LOW or (Q)VO with maximal mixing) somehow\ndisfavoured by data, but favoured by certain theoretical considerations. As discussed in section 3,\ninverted hierarchy is naturally obtained from a Majorana mass matrix of pseudo-Dirac form, that predicts\nall the conditions that give a small or zero mee : \u03b812 \u2248 \u03c0/4, \u03b813 \u2248 0 and \u03b1 \u2248 \u03c0/2.\nIn general, if neutrinos have Majorana masses with inverted spectrum\n\u2022 an accurate measurement of |mee | would be equivalent to a measurement of the Majorana CPviolating phase \u03b1, if oscillation parameters are known;\n\u2022 a strong upper bound on mee would imply \u03b1 \u2248 \u03c0/2 and a correlation between oscillation parameters, that probably would be practically indistinguishable from \u03b812 \u2248 \u03c0/4.\n\n2.5\n\nAlmost degenerate neutrinos\n\nIn this case, the common neutrino mass is essentially equal to the parameter m\u03bde probed by \u03b2-decay\nexperiments. This is presumably the only case that can be tested by near future \u03b2-decay experiments,\nand certainly the only case that could affect present experiments.\nWe discuss in the appendix why we do not consider the recently claimed \"evidence for 0\u03bd2\u03b2\" [5]\nconvincing. Therefore, in this section we will limit to consider the existing bound on 0\u03bd2\u03b2 [34], and we\nwill compute the bound on m\u03bde from 0\u03bd2\u03b2 and oscillation data, that can be compared with the one from\n10\n\n\f10\n\n10\nLMA only\n\n8\n\n8\n\n99 % CL\n\n99 % CL\n\nglobal\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\nmee\n\n6\n\nmax\nimal\n\n4\n\nminima\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\nl mee\n\n6\n\n4\n90 % CL\n\n90 % CL\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nmee in meV\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nm\u03bde in meV\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 6: In the case of inverted hierarchy, we plot the probability distribution of the minimal and\nmaximal values of mee (fig. 6a), and the probability distribution of m\u03bde (fig. 6b).\n\u03b2 decay. The argument goes as follows: letting aside the region where cancellations are possible [50, 46],\n\u03b812 6=\n\n\u03c0\n4\n\nand\n\ntan \u03b813 < | cos 2\u03b812 |1/2\n\n(11)\n\nalmost degenerate neutrinos lead to a non-zero value of mee :\n|mee | \u2265 m\u03bde * (cos2 \u03b813 | cos 2\u03b812 | \u2212 sin2 \u03b813 ).\n\n(12)\n\nThence, the question is whether we know \u03b812 and \u03b813 sufficiently well to exclude a cancellation.\nThe answer is a 'conditional yes', as can be seen from fig. 7. There we show the \u2206\u03c72 obtained\ncombining all existing 0\u03bd2\u03b2 and oscillation data, as function of m\u03bde .7 At 90% CL, this procedure yields\nthe interesting bound m\u03bde < 1.05h eV, which is better than the limit from \u03b2-decay if h is not too large. If\nwe knew that LMA is the true solution of the solar neutrino problem, we would have the 99% CL bound\nm\u03bde < 1.5h eV. These considerations illustrate the importance of obtaining a precise measurements of\nthe 'solar' mixing angle \u03b812 , and of reducing nuclear uncertainties to get further information on massive\nneutrinos. It will be important to reconsider the inference on neutrino mass scale m\u03bde from 0\u03bd2\u03b2, as\nsoon as we will get more precise information on the solar mixing angle \u03b812 from SNO, KamLAND,\nBorexino. The outcome would be particularly interesting if KamLAND will confirm the LMA solution\nwith less-than-maximal mixing.\nWe summarize the possible r\u00f4le of future \u03b2-decay and 0\u03bd2\u03b2-decay experiments as follows\n\u2022 If neutrinos have Majorana masses and if future oscillation data will tell us that eq. (11) is satisfied\nat a high CL, 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments alone will be sufficient to rule out (or confirm) the possibility that\nneutrinos have a large common mass m\u03bde .\n\u2022 If neutrinos have a large common Majorana mass m\u03bde , \u03b2-decay experiments will be necessary to\n2 is\nmeasure it, and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments will permit to investigate the Majorana phases. Since Ve3\nsmall, \u03b1 is the only relevant phase, to a good approximation.\n\n7\nThe dominant bound on \u03b813 comes from the Chooz experiment (when combined with the SK atmospheric constraints\non |\u2206m223 |). The replacement \u03b813 = 0, however, approximates reasonably well the accurate treatment of the Chooz bound.\n\n11\n\n\f10\n\nLMA only\n\n8\n\nglobal\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n99 % CL\n\n6\n4\n90 % CL\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nm\u03bde / h in eV\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 7: The present experimental bound on the mass of degenerate neutrinos from 0\u03bd2\u03b2 and oscillation\nexperiments. The dotted lines illustrate the constraint obtained setting \u03b813 = 0. h \u2248 1 parameterizes the\nuncertainty in the nuclear matrix element (see sect. 2.1).\n\n3\n\nPredictions, expectations, guesses and prejudices\n\nPerhaps the simplest and more conservative theoretical explanation of the lightness of neutrinos is given\nby the idea that neutrino masses are suppressed by the scale of lepton number violation [51]. This\nscenario is well compatible with unification of electroweak and strong interactions at a very high energy\nscale and provides an appealing mechanism for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry. Such\nconsiderations single out, among all possible models of neutrino masses and mixings, those characterized,\nat low energies, by three light Majorana neutrinos. Given the present experimental knowledge, that favors\n\u2206m223 as the leading oscillation frequency, it is also natural to define a zeroth order approximation of the\ntheory, where \u2206m212 and \u03b813 vanish (which allows us to neglect the CP-breaking parameter \u03c6) whereas\n\u03b823 and \u03b812 are maximal. This approximation is of course not realistic and should be regarded only as a\nlimiting case, possibly arising from an underlying symmetry. Many effects can perturb this limit, such\nas small symmetry breaking terms, radiative corrections, effects coming from residual rotations needed\nto diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix, or to render canonical the leptonic kinetic terms. A\ndetailed analysis of these effects would require a separate discussion for each conceivable model, with no\nguarantee of being able to really cover all theoretical possibilities. Here we will adopt a less ambitious\napproach which consists in dealing only with the simplest perturbations of the leading textures, with the\nhope that the results will be sufficiently representative of the many existing models. This point of view\nis only partially supported by present data. If \u2206m212 and \u03b813 were as large as experimentally allowed,\nneutrino data would not clearly point to any simple pattern of the type considered here.\n\nOf course, there are many other promising theoretical ideas on neutrino masses, that maintain their\ninterest (and survive) even after the recent experimental developments. Some of these recent approaches\ninsist on (certain minimal version of) grand unification models [52], and, in particular aim at a link\nwith proton decay rate [53]. There are also attemps to find stricter relations with leptogenesis [54]; or\nwith low energy lepton flavor violating processes in supersymmetric models [55]; etc. We do not want\nto underestimate the validity of these ideas, and we instead hope that some or all of them will find an\nimportant role in a future theory of massive neutrinos. Rather, it should be clear that our approach to\nthe theory of neutrino masses is guided by simple and phenomenological considerations, to the aims of\nexploiting regularities in the observable parameters of massive neutrinos, and of making a guess about\nmee and \u03b813 .\n12\n\n\f3.1\n\nNormal hierarchy\n\nWe begin with the hierarchical neutrino spectrum, whose leading texture, up to redefinitions of the field\nphases, in the mass-eigenstate bases of charged leptons, is given by\n0 0 0\n\uf8ed\nm\u03bd = m 0 1 1 \uf8f8\n0 1 1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nThis structure might be due to a peculiar structure of the mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos,\nof the (Dirac) Yukawa couplings of the neutrinos, or even of the charged leptons in a certain flavor\nbasis [56]; this may arise, for instance, within a U(1) flavor symmetry [57] under which \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4\nare neutral and \u03bde possesses a non-vanishing charge [58, 59, 60]. The determinant of the block (2, 3)\ncan be forced to vanish (so that one naturally obtains \u2206m212 \u226a \u2206m223 ) by making use of the see-saw\nmechanism, if one of the heavy right-handed neutrinos has larger Yukawa couplings and/or is lighter\nthan the other ones [61].8 The resulting neutrino mass matrix has approximately rank one. This setup\ncan be implemented within the framework of a U(1) symmetry [59, 60], which, however, only predicts\na generically large, not necessarily maximal \u03b823 . Another possibility to generate the leading texture in\neq. (13) is at 1 loop [63] or at tree level [64] in supersymmetric models that violate both lepton number\nand R-parity. An important feature of (13) is that \u03b812 is undetermined at leading order.\nTo get a realistic mass matrix, we consider deviations from the symmetric limit in (13), parametrized\nby:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03b4\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n(14)\nm\u03bd = m \uf8ed \u01eb 1 + \u03b7 1 + \u03b7 \uf8f8 ,\n\u01eb 1+\u03b7 1+\u03b7\nwhere \u03b4, \u01eb and \u03b7 denote small (\u226a 1) real parameters, defined up to coefficients of order one that can\ndiffer in the various matrix elements. The mass matrix in (14) does not describe the most general\nperturbation of the zeroth order texture (13). We have implicitly assumed a symmetry between \u03bd\u03bc and\n\u03bd\u03c4 which is preserved by the perturbations, at least at the level of the order of magnitudes. It is difficult\nto understand the precise origin of these small deviations. However, it is possible to construct models\nbased on a spontaneously broken U(1) flavor symmetry, where \u03b4, \u01eb and \u03b7 are given by positive powers of\none or more symmetry breaking parameters. Moreover, by playing with the U(1) charges, we can adjust,\nto certain extent, the relative hierarchy between \u03b7, \u01eb and \u03b4 [65].\nAnother example is given by those models where the neutrino mass matrix elements are dominated,\nvia the see-saw mechanism, by the exchange of two right-handed neutrinos [66]. Since the exchange of a\nsingle right-handed neutrino gives a successful zeroth order texture, we are encouraged to continue along\nthis line. Thus, we add a sub-dominant contribution of a second right-handed neutrino, assuming that\nthe third one gives a negligible contribution to the neutrino mass matrix, because it has much smaller\nYukawa couplings or is much heavier than the first two. The Lagrangian that describes this plausible\nsub-set of see-saw models, written in the mass eigenstate basis of right-handed neutrinos and charged\nleptons, is\nL = \u03bbl Ll N h + \u03bb\u2032l Ll N \u2032 h +\n\nM 2 M \u2032 \u20322\nN +\nN\n2\n2\n\nmll\u2032 \u221d\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03bbl \u03bbl\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u2032 \u2032\n+ l \u2032l\nM\nM\n\nwhere l, l\u2032 = {e, \u03bc, \u03c4 }. The pattern of perturbations in eq. (14) can be reproduced if \u03bbe \u226a \u03bb\u03bc \u2248 \u03bb\u03c4\nand \u03bb\u2032\u03bc \u2248 \u03bb\u2032\u03c4 . Even though the number of see-saw parameters is larger than the number of low-energy\nobservables, there is one neat prediction:\ndet m = 0\n\ni.e.\n\n8\n\nm1 = 0\n\n.\n\nThe suggestion to interpret the data on massive neutrinos by assuming a number of right handed neutrinos as small as\npossible is quite old, see [62]. Note however that in this work it was missed the fact that the model with 2 right-handed\nneutrinos is predictive, as we discuss in the following.\n\n13\n\n\f(We recall that the possibilities to test this case were discussed at length in section 2.3).\nLet us come back to the mass matrix m\u03bd of eq. (14). After a first rotation by an angle \u03b823 close to\n\u03c0/4 and a second rotation with \u03b813 \u2248 \u01eb, we get\n\u03b4 + \u01eb2 \u01eb 0\n\uf8ed\n\u01eb\n\u03b7 0 \uf8f8\nm\u03bd \u2248 m\n0\n0 2\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nup to order one coefficients in the small entries. To obtain a large solar mixing angle, we need |\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b4| <\n\u223c \u01eb.\nIn realistic models there is no reason for a cancellation between independent perturbations and thus we\nassume \u03b4 <\n\u223c \u01eb and \u03b7 <\n\u223c \u01eb, separately.\nConsider first the case \u03b4 \u2248 \u01eb and \u03b7 <\n\u223c \u01eb. The solar mixing angle \u03b812 is large but not maximal, as\npreferred by the large angle MSW solution. We also have \u2206m223 \u2248 4m2 , \u2206m212 \u2248 m2 \u01eb2 and\nmee \u2248\n\nq\n\n\u2206m212\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nthe largest possible prediction, in the case of normal hierarchy, in agreement with the results in section 2.3.\nIf \u03b7 \u2248 \u01eb and \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb, we still have a large solar mixing angle and \u01eb2 \u2248 \u2206m212 /\u2206m223 , as before. However\nmee will be much smaller than the estimate in (16). Unfortunately, this is the case of the models based\non the above mentioned U(1) flavor symmetry that, at least in its simplest realization, tends to predict\n\u03b4 \u2248 \u01eb2 . In this class of models we find\nmee \u2248\n\nq\n\n\u2206m212\n\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223\n\n!1\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nbelow the sensitivity of the next generation of planned experiments. It is worth to mention that in both\ncases discussed above, we have\n\u03b813 \u2248\n\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223\n\n!1\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich might be very close to the present experimental limit.\nIf both \u03b4 and \u03b7 are much smaller than \u01eb, the (1, 2) block of m\u03bd has an approximate pseudo-Dirac\nstructure and the angle \u03b812 becomes maximal. This situation is typical of models where leptons have\nU(1) charges of both signs whereas the order parameters of U(1) breaking have all charges of the same\nsign [60]. We have two eigenvalues approximately given by \u00b1m \u01eb. As an example, we consider the case\nwhere \u03b7 = 0 and \u03b4 \u2248 \u01eb2 . We find sin2 2\u03b812 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u01eb2 /4, \u2206m212 \u2248 m2 \u01eb3 and\nmee \u2248\n\nq\n\n\u2206m212\n\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223\n\n!1\n6\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nIn order to recover the large angle MSW solution we would need a relatively large value of \u01eb. This is\nin general not acceptable because, on the one hand the presence of a large perturbation raises doubts\nabout the consistency of the whole approach and, on the other hand, in existing models where all fermion\nsectors are related to each other, \u01eb is never larger than the Cabibbo angle. We are then forced to embed\nthe case under discussion within the LOW solution, where the solar frequency is much smaller and, as\na consequence, mee is beyond the reach of the next generation of experiments.\n\n3.2\n\nInverted hierarchy\n\nIf the neutrino spectrum has an inverted hierarchy, the leading texture depends on the relative phase\n2\u03b1 between the two non-vanishing eigenvalues. In this case theory can give significant restrictions, since\none has to explain why two neutrinos are degenerate. This degeneracy can be more easily explained for\n14\n\n\fspecial values of the relative phases. In particular, when \u03b1 = \u03c0/2, the resulting texture has an exact\nsymmetry under the combination Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 [67] and reads:\n0 1 1\n\uf8ed\nm\u03bd = m 1 0 0 \uf8f8\n1 0 0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThe Abelian symmetry Le \u2212L\u03bc \u2212L\u03c4 would allow different (1,2) and (1,3) entries, that are chosen equal in\n(20) to recover a maximal \u03b823 . Independently from the relative size of these entries, we have \u03b812 = \u03c0/4,\n\u03b813 = 0, \u2206m223 = 2m2 , \u2206m212 = 0. Notice that an exact Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 symmetry implies mee = 0. If\nit were possible to find a symmetry realizing the inverted hierarchy with \u03b1 6= \u03c0/2, then we could avoid\nmee = 0. We add small perturbations according to:\n\u03b4 1 1\nm\u03bd = m \uf8ed 1 \u03b7 \u03b7 \uf8f8\n1 \u03b7 \u03b7\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nThe perturbations leave \u2206m223 and \u03b823 unchanged, in first approximation. We obtain \u03b813 \u2248 \u03b7, tan2 \u03b812 \u2248\n1 + \u03b4 + \u03b7 and \u2206m212 /\u2206m223 \u2248 \u03b7 + \u03b4, where coefficients of order one have been neglected.\nThere is a well-known difficulty of this scenario to reproduce the large angle MSW solution [67, 68].\nIndeed, barring cancellation between the perturbations, in order to obtain a \u2206m212 close to the best fit\nLMA value, \u03b7 and \u03b4 should be smaller than about 0.1 and this keeps the value of sin2 2\u03b812 very close\nto 1, somewhat in disagreement with global fits of solar data [6]. Even by allowing for a \u2206m212 in the\nupper range of the LMA solution, or some fine-tuning between \u03b7 and \u03b4, we would need large values of\nthe perturbations to fit the LMA solution. On the contrary, the LOW solution can be accommodated,\nbut, even in the optimistic case \u03b4 \u226b \u03b7, we obtain:\nmee\n\n1q\n\u2206m212\n=\n2\n\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223\n\n!1\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\ntoo small to be detected by planned experiments. This is an example where the underlying symmetry\nforces a cancellation between potentially large contributions to mee , which persists also after the inclusion\nof the perturbations. In fact the combination m1 cos2 \u03b812 + m2 e2i\u03b1 cos2 \u03b812 is not of order m, as we could\nnaively expect, but of order m \u03b4. The largest allowed value for \u03b813 is\n\u03b813 \u2248\n\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhich, for the LOW solution, is practically unobservable.\n\n3.3\n\nAlmost degenerate neutrinos\n\nAlso in the case of degenerate spectrum, the zeroth order texture depends on the relative phases between\nthe eigenvalues and this dependence leads to widely different expectation for mee . We have two limiting\ncases: one for \u03b1 = 0, and another one with \u03b1 = \u03c0/2. In the first case mee will be comparable to the\naverage neutrino mass, while in the second case the large mixing in the solar sector tends to deplete\nthe mee entry [69]. There are examples of both these possibilities among the theoretically motivated\nmodels and here we will discuss two representative scenarios. It should be said that it is more difficult to\naccommodate a degenerate neutrino spectrum in a model of fermion masses, than a spectrum with normal\nor inverted hierarchy. The neutrino degeneracy should be made compatible with the observed hierarchy\nin the charged fermion sectors, and this is not an easy task. Once the degeneracy is achieved, at leading\norder, it should be preserved by renormalization group evolution from the energy scale where neutrino\nmasses originate down to the low energy scales where observations take place. The stability under these\n15\n\n\fcorrections may impose severe restrictions on the theory, especially if a very small mass splitting is\nrequired by the solar neutrino oscillations [70, 71]. There is also a generic difficulty in embedding such\na model in a grand unified context where the particle content often includes right-handed neutrinos.\nIndeed, it is difficult to see how a presumably hierarchical Dirac mass matrix combines with a Majorana\nmass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos to give rise, via the see-saw mechanism, to a degenerate\nneutrino spectrum. One idea that partially overcomes some of the above-mentioned problems is that\nof flavor democracy [72], where an approximate S3L \u2297 S3R symmetry leads to the following pattern of\ncharged fermion mass matrices:\n1 1 1\n\uf8ed\n1 1 1 \uf8f8 + \u03b4mf\nmf = m\u0302f\n1 1 1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n,\n\nf = {e,u,d}\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03b4mf denotes small symmetry breaking terms. The corresponding spectrum is hierarchical and\nthe smallness of quark mixing angles can be explained by an almost complete cancellation between the\ntwo unitary left transformations needed to diagonalize mu and md . The neutrino mass matrix has the\ngeneral structure:\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n1 0 0\n1 1 1\n(25)\nm\u03bd = m \uf8f0\uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 + r \uf8ed 1 1 1 \uf8f8\uf8fb + \u03b4m\u03bd ,\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n\nwhere r is an arbitrary parameter and \u03b4m\u03bd represents a small correction to the symmetric limit. The\nfreedom associated to r, \u03b4m\u03bd and \u03b4me allows us to select an almost degenerate and diagonal m\u03bd and\nto extract the large atmospheric and solar mixing angles from the charged lepton sector. However, a\nnon-vanishing \u2206m223 and maximal \u03b812 , \u03b823 angles are not determined by the symmetric limit, but only by\na specific choice of the parameter r and of the perturbations, that cannot be easily justified on theoretical\ngrounds. If, for example, we choose \u03b4m\u03bd = diag(0, \u01eb, \u03b7) with \u01eb < \u03b7 \u226a 1 and r \u226a \u01eb, the solar and the\natmospheric oscillation frequencies are determined by \u01eb and \u03b7, respectively. The mixing angles are entirely\ndue to the q\ncharged lepton sector. A diagonal \u03b4me will give rise to an almost maximal \u03b812 , tan2 \u03b823 \u2248 1/2\nand \u03b813 \u2248 me /m\u03bc . By going to the basis where the charged leptons are diagonal, we can see that mee\nis close to m and independent from the parameters that characterize the oscillation phenomena. Indeed\nm is only limited by the 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay. The parameter r receives radiative corrections [73] that, at leading\norder, are logarithmic and proportional to the square of the \u03c4 lepton Yukawa coupling. It is important\nto guarantee that this correction does not spoil the relation r \u226a \u01eb, whose violation would lead to a\ncompletely different mixing pattern. This raises a 'naturalness' problem for the LOW solution. It would\nbe desirable to provide a more sound basis for the choice of small perturbations in this scenario that is\nquite favorable to signals both in the 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay and in sub-leading oscillations controlled by \u03b813 .\nIf \u03b1 = \u03c0/2, we could have mee well below the average neutrino mass or even below the solar oscillation\nfrequency. This is exemplified by the following leading texture\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\nm\u03bd = m \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n\u221a1\n2\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n1\n2 (1 + \u03b7)\n\u2212 21 (1 + \u03b7)\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2212 12 (1 + \u03b7) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n1\n(1\n+\n\u03b7)\n2\n\uf8f7\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u226a 1, corresponding to an exact bimaximal mixing, with eigenvalues m1 = m, m2 = \u2212m and\nm3 = (1 + \u03b7)m. This texture has been proposed in the context of a spontaneously broken SO(3) flavor\nsymmetry and it has been studied to analyze the stability of the degenerate spectrum against radiative\ncorrections [71]. We add small perturbations to (26) in the form:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\nm\u03bd = m \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03b4\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n1\n2 (1\n\n+ \u03b7)\n1\n1\n\u221a (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 (1 + \u03b7 \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n2\n16\n\n\u221a1 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n\u2212 21 (1 + \u03b7 \u2212 \u01eb)\n1\n2 (1 + \u03b7 \u2212 2\u01eb)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\n\fwhere \u01eb parametrizes the leading flavor-dependent radiative corrections (mainly induced by the \u03c4 Yukawa\ncoupling) and \u03b4 controls mee . We first discuss the case \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb. To first approximation \u03b812 remains\nmaximal, disfavouring an interpretation in the framework of the LMA solution. We get \u2206m212 \u2248 m2 \u01eb2 /\u03b7\nand\n!1/2\n!1/2\n\u2206m212\n\u2206m223 \u2206m212\n\u03b813 \u2248\n.\n(28)\n,\nmee \u226a m\nm4\n\u2206m223\nIf we assume \u03b4 \u226b \u01eb, we find \u2206m212 \u2248 2m2 \u03b4, \u03b823 = \u03c0/4, sin2 2\u03b812 = 1 \u2212 \u03b42 /8 and \u03b813 = 0. Also in this\ncase the solar mixing angle is too close to \u03c0/4 to fit the large angle MSW solution. We get:\nmee \u2248\n\n\u2206m212\n2m\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\ntoo small for detection if the average neutrino mass m is around the eV scale. This rather extreme\nexample shows that there is no guarantee for mee to be close to the range of experimental interest, even\nwith degenerate neutrinos where the involved masses are much larger than the oscillation frequencies.\nWe conclude this section with a comment on a relevant issue raised in [74]: would a measurement\nmee \u223c eV imply the LMA solution, since in such a case the other LOW, (Q)VO solutions are unstable\nunder radiative corrections? The answer is no. Ref. [71] showed examples of degenerate neutrino spectra\nwith mee = 0, \u03b813 = 0 and \u03b812 = \u03c0/4 where \u2206m212 is radiatively generated only at order \u03bb4\u03c4 , rather than\nat order \u03bb2\u03c4 as na\u0131\u0308vely expected. It is easy to find examples with mee 6= 0. The basic observation is that\nthe results in [71] continue to hold if the neutrino mass matrix has the from in eq. (5) of [71] in a flavour\nbasis where the charged lepton mass matrix is not fully diagonal because has a non vanishing 12 entry.\nThe flavour rotation in the 12 plane that leads to the usual basis of e, \u03bc, \u03c4 mass eigenstates, generates\nnon-vanishing mee and \u03b813 and shifts \u03b812 from \u03c0/4. Proceeding along the lines of [71] one concludes that\nin models where\n\u03b1=\n\n\u03c0\n,\n2\n\nsin \u03b813 = tan \u03b823 tan(\u03b812 \u2212 \u03c0/4)\n\nso that |mee | \u2243\n\n2\u03b813\n2\nm + O(\u03b813\n)\ntan \u03b823\n\nradiative corrections generate a solar mass splitting compatible with the LOW and (Q)VO solutions of\nthe solar anomaly; at the same time, mee can be relatively large without violating the Chooz bound.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nAs recalled in section 1, the experimental program on neutrino oscillations is well under way and looks\npromising. We reviewed how it should be possible to access and reliably measure at least 4 of the 6\noscillation parameters in the near future. KamLand and Borexino should finally identify the true solution\nof the solar anomaly. MiniBoone will test the LSND anomaly. K2K, Minos and CNGS should reduce\nthe error on the atmospheric parameters, and probe values of \u03b813 below its present bound. Further\nexperimental progresses and improvements (maybe culminating in a neutrino factory) seem feasible in\nlonger terms, after the first generation of long-baseline experiments, although we cannot exclude that\neffects due to \u03b813 or CP violation are too small to ever be observed.\nThe fact that oscillations are becoming an established fact can only reinforce the motivation for other\napproaches to massive neutrinos, and primarily \u03b2 and neutrino-less double \u03b2 (0\u03bd2\u03b2) decay experiments,\nas discussed in section 2.1. Furthermore, 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay seems to be the only realistic possibility to investigate the Majorana nature of neutrinos. In this connection it is exciting that there are proposals to reach\nthe sensitivity to the mass scales suggested by oscillations, |m2ee | \u223c \u2206m2ij , but at the same time, it is sad\nthat we cannot exclude that mee is negligibly small. In fancier terms, it could be that neutrinos have a\n'hidden Majorana nature'; namely, their mass could be of Majorana type, but it might be very tough to\nprove that property experimentally.\nWe have computed the precise ranges of |mee | in the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy.\n17\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n90% CL\n\n90%\n\n99%\n\n10\u2212 1\n\n10\u2212 1\n\n99%\n90%\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n99%\n\nmee in eV\n\nmee in eV\n\n90%\n\n90%\n\n\u2206m223 < 0\n10\u2212 2\n\n99%\n\u2206m223 > 0\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n90%\nLMA\n\n10\u2212 3\n\nLOW\nNormal\n\nLMA\nLOW\nInverted\n\nLMA\nLOW\nm\u03bd = 1 eV\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 2\n10\u2212 1\nlightest neutrino mass in eV\n\n1\n\nFigure 8: In fig. 8a we show the 90% and 99% CL ranges of mee in the cases of normal hierarchy\n(i.e. 0 = m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m2 , so that \u2206m223 > 0) inverted hierarchy (i.e. 0 = m3 \u226a m1 \u2248 m2 , so that\n\u2206m223 < 0) and almost degenerate neutrinos at 1 eV (a value chosen for illustration). LOW collectively\ndenotes large mixing angle solutions other than LMA. In fig. 8b, without distinguishing LMA or LOW,\nwe plot the 90% CL range for mee as function of the lightest neutrino mass, thereby covering all spectra.\n\n\u2022 In the case of normal hierarchy (i.e. m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 , see section 2.5) we get the 90% CL range\n|mee | = (0.7 \u00f7 4.6) meV. If \u03b813 is somewhat below its present bound and LMA is the solution of\nthe solar neutrino anomaly, this case gives a testable prediction: mee \u2248 (\u2206m212 )1/2 sin2 \u03b812 .\n\u2022 In the case of inverted hierarchy (i.e. m3 \u226a m1 \u2248 m2 , see section 2.4) we get the 90% CL\nrange |mee | = (12 \u00f7 57) meV. However, a much smaller mee is allowed at somewhat higher CL and\nsuggested by theoretical considerations.\nThese results are summarized in fig. 8a, where we also show the ranges of mee , restricted to the LMA\nand to the other large mixing angle solutions of the solar anomaly (collectively denoted as 'LOW'). The\nSMA solution is only allowed at higher CL than the ones we consider.\nBeyond these two special cases (where the lightest neutrino has a little or negligible mass), there\nis a family of more generic spectra (sometimes named 'partial hierarchy', 'partial degeneracy', . . . )\nconveniently parametrised by the lightest neutrino mass, mmin . In fig. 8b we show how the 90% CL range\nfor mee varies as a function of mmin (note that this figure improves on traditional plots in mmin \u2212 mee\nplane [46], which are done at fixed values of the oscillation parameters). When mmin is larger than the\noscillation scales (so that neutrinos are almost degenerate at a common mass m\u03bde ) we get the 90% range\nmee = (0.17 \u00f7 1) m\u03bde (see fig. 8a for more detailed results). We also considered the implications of\npresent data:\n\u2022 In the case of almost degenerate neutrinos (section 2.5) we converted the present 0\u03bd2\u03b2 bound\n(mee < 0.38h eV at 95% CL; h \u223c 1 parameterizes nuclear uncertainties, see section 2.1) into a 90%\nCL bound on their common mass, m\u03bde < 1.05h eV, competitive with the direct \u03b2-decay bound.\nThis bound could become stronger with future oscillation data. In particular, if KamLAND will confirm\nthe LMA solution of the solar neutrino anomaly, it will be important to update the inferences on mee\nperformed in the present work. Within the three Majorana neutrino context we assumed, existing and\nplanned \u03b2 decay experiments can see a signal only if neutrinos are almost degenerate. However, future\n0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments alone could rule out this possibility, if future oscillation data will safely tell us that\n| cos 2\u03b812 | > tan2 \u03b813 . If neutrinos indeed have a large common Majorana mass, only with both \u03b2 and\n0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments will it be possible to measure it, and learn on relevant Majorana phase.\n18\n\n\fA recent paper [5] claims a 0\u03bd2\u03b2 evidence for almost degenerate neutrinos. In the appendix we\nreanalysed the data on which such claim is based and proposed a statistically fair way of extracting the\nsignal from the background. Assuming that the relevant sources of background are the ones discussed\nin [5], we get a 1.5\u03c3 hint (or less, depending on the data-set used) for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 from the published data.\nIn section 3.3 we provide a counterexample to the statement that measuring mee \u223c eV would imply\nthe LMA solution: the other LOW, (Q)VO solutions would not necessarily be unstable under radiative\ncorrections.\nAll mee ranges obtained above have been derived allowing for cancellations between the different\ncontributions to mee . One could be tempted to obtain more optimistic results by invoking 'naturalness'\narguments to disfavour large cancellations. As discussed in section 2.2, since mee is a theoretically clean\nquantity (the ee element of the neutrino mass matrix) some flavour symmetry could force it to be small,\ngiving rise to apparently unnatural cancellations when mee is written in terms of the phenomenological\nparameters. Phenomenology alone implies only the relatively weak results summarized above.\nFor this reason in section 3 we have estimated mee and \u03b813 in models of neutrino masses. We considered few theoretically well-motivated textures, that existing models can reproduce in some appropriate\nlimit, and we added small perturbations to mimic the realistic case. Even though this procedure cannot\nof course cover all possibilities, it illustrates, for each type of spectrum, the typical theoretical expectations for mee and \u03b813 and provides examples where flavour symmetries force a small mee . Qualitatively\nwe can summarize our analysis by saying that values of mee above 10 meV are certainly possible for\nmodels of quasi-degenerate neutrinos, but they would come as unexpected in models characterized by\nnormal or inverted hierarchy. In models realizing the LMA solutions, independently from the type of\nspectrum, the angle \u03b813 is usually close to its present experimental limit.\nAcknowledgment We are very grateful to G.

The measured value would be mee /h = (0.39 \u00b1 0.11) eV, implying almost degenerate neutrinos\nwith mass m\u03bde \u2265 |mee |, partly testable at Katrin [37]. Such a result would be of the highest importance.\nHowever, we believe that the published data only contain a \u223c 1.5\u03c3 hint (or less, depending on the data-set\nused) and we would like to explain why in this appendix.\nThe data in fig.s 2 and 3 of [5] are reported in our fig.s 9a and b, where we show the two histograms\nwith the energy distribution of the second data-set (from detectors 1, 2, 3, 5) and of the third data-set\n(from detectors 2, 3, 5, with pulse-shape discrimination applied in order to reduce the background). A\n0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal would show up as a peak centered at the energy E = Q0 = 2039.0 keV and width equal\nto the energy resolution, \u03c3E = 1.59 \u00b1 0.19 keV. A quick look at the data shows no clear peak; so one\nwonders what is known a priori on the spectrum, and which is the procedure of analysis to be applied.\nOur first step is to repeat the exercise done in [5]: we compute the likelihood of having one peak\nof width \u03c3E centered at a generic energy E, on the top of a constant background of unknown intensity\nb in the energy range (2000 \u00f7 2080) keV. The continuous blue lines in fig.s 9a,b (the right ordinates\nshow their scale) show our results.9 They reasonably agree with the corresponding fig.s 5 and 6 of [5],\n9\n\nWhat we precisely plot is 1 \u2212 L(background)/L(background + peak at E), where L(background) is the likelihood of\nhaving a constant background, while L(background + peak at E) is the likelihood of having a constant background plus\na peak at an energy E. The level of the background and the height of the peak are treated as free parameters.

In\neach case we superimpose the best fit in terms of a constant background (dashed line) and in terms of a\nconstant background, plus a background due to \u03b3-peaks of 214 Bi, plus a 0\u03bd2\u03b2 peak at E = 2039 keV. In\neach plot the continuous blue line shows the likelihood (the right ordinates show the scale) of having a\npeak at energy E. The third plot shows how the evidence for a 0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal varies if, following [5], one\nfits the data in terms of 0\u03bd2\u03b2 peak plus a constant background, using only data in a restricted window.\nalthough we find a somewhat lower probability that a peak is present at E \u2248 Q0 than in [5] (because [5]\nfits data with thinner binning than in the published data). In both cases more pronounced peaks seem\npresent at other energies.\nThe evidence of [5] is obtained by restricting the search window to the energy range E = Q0 \u00b1few*\u03c3E ,\nsuch that it does not include the other peaks, and by fitting the data under the hypothesis of a peak\nat Q0 plus a constant background. An obvious criticism to this procedure is that the data look like a\npeak over a constant background because one has chosen the specific window where this happens. This\nprocedure would be justified if the size of the search window were not a significant arbitrary choice, e.g.\nif one could clearly see in the data a peak at Q0 emerging over the background. However, this structure\nis not clearly visible in the data-sets. In order to state quantitatively our concern, we show in fig. 9c\nhow the evidence for a 0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal (quantified as \u2206\u03c72 = \u03c72no 0\u03bd2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c72best ) fluctuates when one chooses\nwindows of different sizes around Q0 . A 'too small' window does not allow to discriminate the signal\nfrom the background, since it can only be distinguished from the signal exploiting their different energy\ndependence. With an appropriate window the evidence for a peak at Q0 can reach the 3\u03c3 level. Both\nthe evidence and the central value of the signal change when the size of the window is varied. There is\nalmost no evidence when a large window is chosen; but if the background were constant, a large window\nwould be the fairest way to estimate its level.\nIn summary: the data contain no evidence for a 0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal under the assumption of an energyindependent background in the plotted range. Evidence could only be claimed if the background had a\nfavourable energy spectrum (smaller around Q0 and larger far from Q0 ) and if one could understand it,\nallowing to disentangle the signal from the background. Therefore the crucial question is: what is the\ncomposition of the background, and in particular what are the peaks in the rest of the spectrum, which\nseem to emerge from a constant background? The authors of [5] observe that some peaks lie around the\nknown energies of \u03b3-peaks of 214 Bi:\n\n2\n\nEa = {2010.7 keV, 2016.7 keV, 2021.8 keV, 2052.9 keV};\n\nlikelihoods L \u2261 e\u2212\u03c7 /2 are computed as \u03c72 = (\u03c3E \u2212 1.59 keV)2 /(0.19 keV)2 + i \u03c72i , where the \u03c72i relative to the ith bin\n(which has ni observed and \u03bci expected events) is given by Poissionan statistics as \u03c72i = 2(\u03bci \u2212 ni ln \u03bci ). Finally, the \u03c72 is\nminimized with respect to the nuisance parameters b and \u03c3E . In Gaussian approximation, the Bayesian and frequentistic\ntechniques employed in [5] both reduce to this procedure. We repeated all analyses described in this appendix using a\nBayesian procedure, finding very little differences with respect to its Gaussian limit.\n\nP\n\n20\n\n\f10\n\n2\n0 HM\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nmee / h in eV\n\nLMA only\n99 % CL\n\n6\n\u2206\u03c72\n\nwin\ndo\n\nsis\n\nkeV\n\n8\n\n99 % CL\n\n90 % CL\n\n4\n\nglobal\n90 % CL\n\n\u00b1 10\n\n4\n\neana\nly\n\n6\n\nOur\nr\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n8\n\nw\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n2\nm\u03bde / h in eV\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 10: Fig. 10a: the \u03c72 (mee /h) extracted in different ways from the Heidelberg\u2013Moscow data without\npulse-shape discrimination. Fig. 10b: bounds on the degenerate neutrino mass, using our reanalysis of\nthese data.\nthis is how they motivate the choice of a small search window that excludes them.\nIf this is the real composition of the backgrounds, one should analyse all data assuming that they are\ncomposed of: a constant component, plus the 214 Bi peaks, plus a possible signal s. Therefore we write\nthe number of events as\nX\ndn\n=b+\npa \u03c1(E \u2212 Ea ) + s \u03c1(E \u2212 Q0 )\ndE\na\n\n2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212E /2\u03c3E\n.\nwhere \u03c1(E) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3E\n\nThe relative intensity of the 214 Bi \u03b3-lines is known [75]. We marginalize the \u03c72 with respect to the\nnuisance parameters that describe the backgrounds and the energy resolution, obtaining the \u03c72 distribution of the signal, \u03c72 (s) (1 degree of freedom). In this way we find a weak evidence of a peak at Q0 :\n\u03c72 (0) \u2212 \u03c72best (s) \u2248 2 (0.5) using the second (third) data-set; namely, a 1.5\u03c3 evidence at most. The best\nfit is shown in fig.s 9 (dotted lines). The constant component of the background is only slightly lower\nthan under the hypothesis that all events are due to a constant background (dashed lines). In both cases\nat Q0 there is no peak significantly above the background level, so that we obtain little evidence for a\n0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal. In fig. 10a we show the \u03c72 (mee /h), as obtained from three different analyses of the HM\ndata without pulse-shape discrimination: by choosing a small search window (as in [5]), by modeling the\nbackground (as proposed here), and assuming a constant background (as in the HM paper [34], where\na slightly different data-set was analysed). In fig. 10b we show the bounds on the degenerate neutrino\nmass, using our reanalysis of these data. Note that the upper bound on m\u03bde in fig. 7 is stronger, because\nwe used the HM analysis of data with pulse-shape discrimination. The connection of massive neutrinos\nwith cosmology is well known (e.g. [29], for earlier works about neutrinos as warm dark matter see [78]).\nWith actual data and simulations of the apparatus, it could be possible to do better than what we\ncan do, by calculating also the absolute intensity of the faint 214 Bi lines in the (2000 \u00f7 2080) keV region\nbased on other, much more intense lines of this isotope. According to fig.s 2,3 of [34], the measured\nintensity of the line at E \u2248 1764.5 keV is 25 counts/kg * yr.10 Taking into account that there is no\nsignificant variation of the efficiency between 1764 keV and Q0 [76], the line at 1764.5 keV should have\nan intensity of 90 \u00b1 14 (25 \u00b1 14) counts/kg * yr, according to our fit of faint lines in the second (third)\ndataset. Including this extra information in the fit reduces the significance of the 'evidence' to 1\u03c3 (0.5\u03c3)\nin the second (third) dataset.\nA significant 0\u03bd2\u03b2 signal could finally result if most peaks are not statistical fluctuations, and could\nbe identified. However a comparison between the two data-sets discourages such hopes. We expect\nthat the pulse-shape discrimination should suppress the background from \u03b3-lines (since the annihilation\nenergy of the positron may be deposited in a relatively wider region) more than the hypothetical 0\u03bd2\u03b2\nsignal (since the two e\u2212 deposit their energy in a narrow region). A detailed simulation of the detector is\n10\nFig. 1 of [34] gives an intensity of 4 counts/kg * yr, 6 times smaller. The reason of the disagreement is that in fig. 1 the\ncounts of a single crystal were divided by total exposure (5 crystals), unlike what written in its caption [77].\n\n21\n\n\fneeded to estimate this issue quantitatively. The problem is that fig.s 9a,b and our best-fit values indicate\nrather that pulse-shape discrimination gives an almost equal suppression: the constant background gets\nreduced by a factor \u2248 3.5/\u03b7, the identified \u03b3-lines by \u2248 3.8/\u03b7, the hypothetical peak at Q0 by \u2248 3.2/\u03b7\n(\u03b7 = 0.55 \u00b1 0.10 is the efficiency of pulse-shape discrimination). In any case, the assumption that the\nbackground in the vicinity of Q0 is particularly small is too important to be just assumed, as done in [5],\nand should be demonstrated in some manner.\nIn conclusion, we do not see a really significant evidence for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 in the published data. A better\nunderstanding and control of the background is necessary to learn more from present data (and maybe\nrecognize a signal) and also in view of future search of 0\u03bd2\u03b2 with 76 Ge detectors.\n\nReferences\n[1] The SuperKamiokande collaboration, Phys.

Concerning solar data,\nwe include the KamLAND data [1A] that confirm the LMA solution, the most recent data from GNO\nand the full set of spectral and day/night SNO data [2A]. Concerning atmospheric data, we include\nthe latest SK and K2K data [3A]. In view of these improvements, our knowledge of neutrino oscillation\nparameters can now be approximatively summarized as\n\u2206m212 = (7.1 \u00b1 0.6)10\u22125 eV2 ,\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.45 \u00b1 0.06,\n\n|\u2206m223 | = (2.7 \u00b1 0.4)10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\nsin2 2\u03b823 = 1.00 \u00b1 0.04,\n\nsin2 2\u03b813 = 0 \u00b1 0.065.\n\nOur inferences on the parameter |mee | probed by 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments are obtained by marginalizing the full\njoint probability distribution for the oscillation parameters. We employ the fit of solar and KamLAND\ndata presented in [4A] (6 out of 8 other similar analyses [5A] agree with [4A]). Our updated results,\nshown in fig. 11a,b,c,d, are similar to the lines \"LMA only\" in the corresponding figures 4, 6, 7 and 8 in\nthe original version of this work. Assuming three CPT-invariant massive Majorana neutrinos we get\na) In the case of normal hierarchy (i.e. m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 , or \u2206m223 > 0) the ee element of the neutrino\n2i\u03b2 matm |\nmass matrix probed by 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay experiments can be written as |mee | = |e2i\u03b1 msun\nee + e\nee\n(see section 2.5) where \u03b1, \u03b2 are unknown Majorana phases and the 'solar' and 'atmospheric' contributions can be predicted from oscillation data. Including KamLAND data, that restrict the LMA\nrange of \u2206m212 , the solar contribution to mee is msun\nee = (2.6 \u00b1 0.4) meV. The bound on \u03b813 from\nCHOOZ, SK and K2K implies matm\n<\n2\nmeV\nat\n99%\nCL. By combining these two contributions\nee\nwe get the range\n|mee | = (1.1 \u00f7 4.1) meV at 90% CL\n\nand\n\n|mee | = (0.2 \u00f7 5.1) meV at 99% CL.\n\n(1A)\n\nThe precise prediction is shown in fig. 11a.\nb) In the case of inverted hierarchy (i.e. m3 \u226a m1 \u2248 m2 , or \u2206m223 < 0), from the prediction\n|mee | \u2248 (\u2206m223 )1/2 \u00d7 | cos2 \u03b812 + e2i\u03b1 sin2 \u03b812 | cos2 \u03b813 (see section 2.4) we get the range\n|mee | = (14 \u00f7 57) meV at 90% CL\n\nand\n\n|mee | = (9.2 \u00f7 61) meV at 99% CL.\n\n(2A)\n\nThe precise prediction is shown in fig. 11b. The inclusion of KamLAND data does not significantly\nrestrict the |mee | range because the main uncertainty is due to the Majorana phase \u03b1 not to the\noscillation parameters. If the present central values were confirmed with infinite precision we would\nstill have the loose range |mee | = (20 \u00f7 52) meV at any CL. The uncertainty in the lower (upper)\nbound is today dominated by the error on \u03b812 (\u2206m223 ).\nThe |mee | ranges for normal and inverted hierarchy no longer overlap. Values of |mee | outside these\nranges are possible if the lightest neutrino mass is not negligible, as shown in fig. 11d. If \u2206m223 < 0 a\nnon zero lightest neutrino mass does not allow smaller |mee | than in case b): eq. (2B) is a true lower\nbound. The darker regions in fig. 11d show how the predicted range of |mee | would shrink if the present\nbest-fit values of oscillation parameters were confirmed with infinite precision. The two funnels present\nfor \u2206m223 > 0 have an infinitesimal width because we assume \u03b813 = 0 and would have a finite width if\n\u03b813 6= 0.\nc) The bound on the mass m\u03bde of almost-degenerate neutrinos implied by present 0\u03bd2\u03b2 data is\nm\u03bde < 1.0 (1.5) h eV\n\nat 90 (99%) CL.\n\n(3A)\n\nThe precise bound is shown in fig. 11c. The factor h \u2248 1 parameterizes the uncertainty in the\nnuclear matrix element (see sect. 2.1). As discussed in section 2.5 (see also [6A]) this bound is\nbased on the fact that a large m\u03bde is compatible with the upper bound on |mee | only if \u03b812 \u2248 \u03c0/4.\n25\n\n\f10\n\n10\nNormal hierarchy\n\nInverted hierarchy\n\n8\n\n8\n99 % CL\n\n99 % CL\n\n6\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n90 % CL\n\n90 % CL\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nmee\n\n3\n4\nin meV\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nmee in meV\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n1\n90% CL (1 dof)\n\nDegenerate neutrinos\n8\n\n10\u2212 1\n99 % CL\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n4\n\n\u2206m223 < 0\n10\u2212 2\n\u2206m223 > 0\n\n90 % CL\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nm\u03bde / h in eV\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 4\n\n2\n\n10\u2212 3\n10\u2212 2\n10\u2212 1\nlightest neutrino mass in eV\n\ndisfavoured by cosmology\n\nmee in eV\n\n6\n\n1\n\nFigure 11: Predictions for |mee | assuming a hierarchical (fig. 11a) and inverted (fig. 11b) neutrino spectrum. In fig. 11c we update the upper bound on the mass of quasi-degenerate neutrinos implied by 0\u03bd2\u03b2\nsearches. The factor h \u2248 1 parameterizes the uncertainty in the nuclear matrix element (see sect. 2.1).\nIn fig. 11d we plot the 90% CL range for mee as function of the lightest neutrino mass, thereby covering\nall spectra. The darker regions show how the mee range would shrink if the present best-fit values of\noscillation parameters were confirmed with negligible error.\n\n26\n\n\fMaximal solar mixing was already disfavoured at almost 3\u03c3 before KamLAND (fig. 7) and is\nnow disfavoured at almost 4\u03c3 (fig. 11c). KamLAND alone does not yet disfavour \u03b812 \u2248 \u03c0/4. The\nbound on neutrino masses in eq. (3B), obtained combining oscillation and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 data under the\nassumption that neutrinos are Majorana particles, can be directly compared with the bound from\ndirect searches of neutrino mass in tritium decays, m\u03bde < 2.2 eV at 95% CL. We employ the bound\non |mee | from Heidelberg\u2013Moscow (HM) data, as analyzed by the collaboration.\nA reanalysis [7A] of HM data [8A] claimed evidence for 0\u03bd2\u03b2. Since this is an important but controversial\nissue, even minor points have been carefully debated [10A, 11A, 12A, 13A, 14A]. We here summarize\nwhat we believe is the main point. The reanalysis in [7A] was restricted to the particular subset of data\nthat seems to contain an evidence, neglecting the rest. Reanalysing all data using what we know about\nthe signal and about the background we found a 1.5\u03c3 hint at most (see appendix A of this paper11 ).\nOther reanalyses performed along these lines and precisely described by their authors find 1.1\u03c3 [14A],\n1.46\u03c3 [12A], less than 1\u03c3 [11A] (these authors combine HM [8A] and IGEX [9A] data. Both experiments\nuse 76 Ge with a similar energy resolution and background level. IGEX has about 5 times less statistic and\nfinds a slight deficit of events around the 0\u03bd2\u03b2 Q value, where HM finds a slight excess). In conclusion,\nthe hint for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 is not statistically significant.\n\nReferences\n\nhep-ph/0212212; H. Nunokawa et al., hep-ph/0212202;\nP.

This claim refers to a fit of an average sample of simulated data (generated under some\nassumption). Our claim is that the restriction in the window search is a critical arbitrary choice when analyzing the real\ndata: this can be seen from our fig. 9c.\n\n27\n\n\fAddendum B: 'salt' SNO data\nWe update our previous results by including 'salt' SNO data and the most recent data from GNO and\nSAGE [1B]. Concerning atmospheric data, we take into account the latest Super-Kamiokande (SK) and\nK2K analyses [2B], which reduced the best fit value of the atmospheric mass splitting. In view of these\nimprovements, our knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters can now be approximatively summarized\nas12\n\u2206m212 = (7.2 \u00b1 0.7)10\u22125 eV2 ,\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.05,\n\n|\u2206m223 | = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4)10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\nsin2 2\u03b823 = 1.00 \u00b1 0.04,\n\nsin2 2\u03b813 = 0 \u00b1 0.085.\n\nOur inferences on the parameter |mee | probed by 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiments are obtained by marginalizing the full\njoint probability distribution for the oscillation parameters. We employ the fit of solar and KamLAND\ndata presented in [3B]. Assuming three CPT-invariant massive Majorana neutrinos we get\na) In the case of normal hierarchy (i.e. m1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3 , or \u2206m223 > 0) the ee element of the neutrino\n2i\u03b2 matm |\nmass matrix probed by 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay experiments can be written as |mee | = |e2i\u03b1 msun\nee\nee + e\n(see section 2.3) where \u03b1, \u03b2 are unknown Majorana phases and the 'solar' and 'atmospheric' contributions can be predicted from oscillation data. Including KamLAND data, that restrict the LMA\nrange of \u2206m212 , the solar contribution to mee is msun\nee = (2.45 \u00b1 0.23) meV.\nThe bound on \u03b813 from CHOOZ, SK and K2K implies matm\nee < 2 meV at 99% CL. By combining\nthese two contributions we get the range\n|mee | = (0.9 \u00f7 4.1) meV at 90% CL\n\nand\n\n|mee | = (0 \u00f7 5.1) meV at 99% CL.\n\n(1B)\n\nThe precise prediction is shown in fig. 12a.\nb) In the case of inverted hierarchy (i.e. m3 \u226a m1 \u2248 m2 , or \u2206m223 < 0), from the prediction\n|mee | \u2248 (\u2206m223 )1/2 \u00d7 | cos2 \u03b812 + e2i\u03b1 sin2 \u03b812 | cos2 \u03b813 (see section 2.4) we get the range\n|mee | = (14 \u00f7 53) meV at 90% CL\n\nand\n\n|mee | = (11 \u00f7 58) meV at 99% CL.\n\n(2B)\n\nThe precise prediction is shown in fig. 12b. The inclusion of SNO 'salt' data does not significantly\nrestrict the |mee | range because the main uncertainty is due to the Majorana phase \u03b1, no longer due\nto the oscillation parameters. If the present best-fit values were confirmed with infinite precision\nwe would still have the loose range |mee | = (19 \u00f7 45) meV at any CL. Ref. [4B] found a value in\nagreement with our results and emphasized that the lower bound on |mee | (here shown in the left\npart of fig. 12b) remains valid even if KamLAND or one of the solar data is dropped from a global\nanalysis (the bound is 'robust').\nThe |mee | ranges for normal and inverted hierarchy do not overlap. Values of |mee | outside these ranges\nare possible if the lightest neutrino mass is not negligible, as shown in fig. 12d. If \u2206m223 < 0 a non zero\nlightest neutrino mass does not allow smaller |mee | than in case b): eq. (2B) is a true lower bound. The\ndarker regions in fig. 12d show how the predicted range of |mee | would shrink if the present best-fit values\nof oscillation parameters were confirmed with infinite precision. The two funnels present for \u2206m223 > 0\nhave an infinitesimal width because we assume \u03b813 = 0 and would have a finite width if \u03b813 6= 0.\n12\nTo give a feeling of how accuratelty present fits can be summarized in this way, we dicuss the case of the solar mixing\nangle. According to our analysis, the 1\u03c3 ranges around the best-fit value are tan2 \u03b8 = 0.414+0.05\n\u22120.04 . Since errors are more\nasymmetric at larger confindence levels we prefer to report the symmetric 1\u03c3 range that gives the precise 99% CL range.\n\n28\n\n\f10\n\n10\nNormal hierarchy\n\nInverted hierarchy\n\n8\n\n8\n99 % CL\n\n99 % CL\n\n6\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n90 % CL\n\n90 % CL\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n| mee | in meV\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\n50\n| mee | in meV\n\n70\n\n1\ndisfavoured by 0\u03bd2\u03b2\n\nDegenerate neutrinos\n8\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n4\n\n\u2206m223 < 0\n10\u2212 2\n\u2206m223 > 0\n10\u2212 3\n\n2\n90% CL (1 dof)\n\u22124\n\n10\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.8\nm\u03bde / h in eV\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 3\n10\u2212 2\n10\u2212 1\nlightest neutrino mass in eV\n\ndisfavoured by cosmology\n\n| mee | in eV\n\n10\u2212 1\n\n6\n\n0\n\n60\n\n1\n\nFigure 12: Predictions for |mee | assuming a hierarchical (fig. 12a) and inverted (fig. 12b) neutrino spectrum. In fig. 12c we update the upper bound on the mass of quasi-degenerate neutrinos implied by 0\u03bd2\u03b2\nsearches. The factor h \u2248 1 parameterizes the uncertainty in the nuclear matrix element (see sect. 2.1).\nIn fig. 12d we plot the 90% CL range for mee as function of the lightest neutrino mass, thereby covering\nall spectra. The darker regions show how the mee range would shrink if the present best-fit values of\noscillation parameters were confirmed with negligible error.\n\n29\n\n\fc) The bound on the mass m\u03bde of almost-degenerate neutrinos implied by present 0\u03bd2\u03b2 data is\nm\u03bde < 0.9 (1.2) h eV\n\nat 90 (99%) CL.\n\n(3B)\n\nThe precise bound is shown in fig. 12c. The factor h \u2248 1 parameterizes the uncertainty in the\nnuclear matrix element (see sect. 2.1). As discussed in section 2.5 this bound is based on the fact\nthat a large m\u03bde is compatible with the upper bound on |mee | only if \u03b812 \u2248 \u03c0/4. Maximal solar\nmixing was already disfavoured at almost 4\u03c3 before salt SNO data and is now disfavoured at 5.4\u03c3\n(fig. 12c). We employ the bound on |mee | from Heidelberg\u2013Moscow (HM) data, as analyzed by the\ncollaboration.\nThe bound on neutrino masses in eq. (3B), obtained combining oscillation and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 data under the\nassumption that neutrinos are Majorana particles, can be directly compared with the bound from direct\nsearches of neutrino mass in tritium decays, m\u03bde < 2.2 eV at 95% CL, or with the tight limits obtained in\ncosmology [5B], m\u03bde < 0.23 eV at 95% CL. Fig. 12d also shows bounds from cosmology [5B] and from the\nHeidelberg-Moscow [34] 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiment (assuming h = 1). Both bounds are somewhat controversial,\nand in both cases hints that some effect has been detected have been suggested by some alternative\nanalyses [6B, 7B], not reported here. In practice, these bounds can be relaxed by a factor of two in more\nconservative analyses.\nFor \u03b2 decay the predictions are (99% CL range): m\u03bde = (3.9 \u00f7 10.8) meV for normal hierarchy and\nm\u03bde = (45 \u00b1 4) meV for inverted hierarchy. This last value is 5 times below the planned sensitivity of\nKatrin.\n\nReferences\n[1B]\n\nThe SNO collaboration, nucl-ex/0309004.
