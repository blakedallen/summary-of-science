It is also considered to be\nthe most nonclassical nature of quantum composite systems\nand impossible to be simulated within classical formalism [2].\nRecently, it is found that there may be nonclassical correlations in the quantum states other than entanglement, which is\nfragile with respect to environment. Quantum discord (QD)\nis proposed to be a measure of quantumness of correlation\nof bipartite systems, which is arising from the difference between two quantum extensions of the classical mutual information [3]. In the case of pure states, QD reduces to entropy\nof entanglement [4]. In mixed states, QD and entanglement\nare independent measures of correlation without simple relative ordering [4, 5]. QD of disentangled state may not be\nzero [3]. Nonentanglement quantum discord may provide the\nquantum advantage in the deterministic quantum computation\nwith one quantum bit (DQC1)[6, 7]. Though quantum discord arises from quantum information, it may also be applied\nto condensed matter physics, such as indicating the quantum\nphase transition [8\u201311].\nSpin is thought to be a suitable candidate as qubits, and\nthe Heisenberg model describes the basic spin-spin interaction [12]. Naturally, this type of model has been extensively\nstudied, and can be found in Refs. [8, 13\u201316]. Some features\nof QD are revealed, and behavior of QD is characterized with\ntunable parameters, e.g., external field, temperature, spin-spin\ncoupling constant etc. By changing the temperature and also\nby applying an external field, several remarkable effects for\nQD are observed, many of them in sharp contrast to the behavior observed for the entanglement. It is revealed that situations\nwhere QD increases with temperature while entanglement decreases or while entanglement is zero in two-qubit Heisenberg model [8]. It is argued that models of low-dimensional\nmagnetic materials may supplemented with DzyaloshinskyMoriya (DM) interaction, which is arising from the spin-orbit\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor. Email: yanyiying@shu.edu.cn.\n\ncoupling [17]. The Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange interaction describes superexchange between the interacting spins,\nand is known to generate many dramatical features [18\u201322].\nIt is found that DM interaction can excite entanglement and\nteleportation fidelity.\nDecoherence is the main obstacle for practical implementation of quantum computing. Dynamics of quantum discord\nin presence interaction with the environment can be found in\nRefs. [23\u201328]. Both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics of QD were investigated theoretically and experimentally.\nIt was revealed that quantum discord is more robust than entanglement against decoherence. In this sense, it is argued\nthat the quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord\nis expected to be more robust than based on entanglement. Recently, Quantum correlation has been investigated experimentally [29], the sudden transition from a classical to a quantum\ndecoherence regime is observed during the dynamics of a Bell\ndiagonal state in a non-Markovian dephasing environment.\nIn this paper we consider pairwise QD of three-qubit XXZ\nmodel with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a heat reservoir. We start in Sec. II for introducing three qubits XXZ\nmodel with DM interaction in a canonical ensemble. In\nSec. III we investigate behavior of pairwise thermal QD with\nvariation of system parameters, and present the respective numerical results. In Sec. IV, We calculate the dissipative dynamics of pairwise thermal quantum discord under Markovian\nenvironments. We analyze two types of quantum channel such\nas dephasing, depolarizing, by assuming each qubit coupling\nto local noisy independently. The conclusions are obtained in\nthe last section.\n\nII. MODEL AND ITS SOLUTION\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a XXZ model with z-component DM\ninteraction can be expressed as\nH =\n\n3\nJX x x\n[\u03c3 \u03c3 + \u03c3yn \u03c3yn+1 + \u2206\u03c3zn \u03c3zn+1\n2 n=1 n n+1\nx\n+ D(\u03c3nx \u03c3yn+1 \u2212 \u03c3yn \u03c3n+1\n)] + B\n\n3\nX\nn=1\n\n\u03c3zn ,\n\n(1)\n\n\f1\nwhere \u03c3\u03b1n (\u03b1 = x, y, z) denote the Pauli matrices for qubit n, J\nis the coupling constant, D is the z-component DM interaction\nstrength, \u2206 is an anisotropy parameter, B is an external magnetic field in the z-direction. Periodic boundary conditions are\nassumed as \u03c3\u03b11 = \u03c3\u03b14 .\nIt is easy to calculate the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian:\n\n|\u03c60 i = |000i,\n1\n|\u03c61 i = \u221a (|011i + |101i + |110i),\n3\n1\n|\u03c62 i = \u221a (|001i + |010i + |100i),\n3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n|\u03c63 i = \u221a [(i + 3)|011i + (i \u2212 3)|101i \u2212 2i|110i],\n2 3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n|\u03c64 i = \u221a [(i \u2212 3)|011i + (i + 3)|101i \u2212 2i|110i],\n2 3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n|\u03c65 i = \u221a [(i + 3)|001i + (i \u2212 3)|010i \u2212 2i|100i],\n2 3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n|\u03c66 i = \u221a [(i \u2212 3)|001i + (i + 3)|010i \u2212 2i|100i],\n2 3\n|\u03c67 i = |111i,\n(2)\nand the corresponding eigenvalues: E0 = 23 J\u2206 + 3B, E1 =\n\u221a\n2J \u2212 12 J\u2206\u2212 B, E2 = 2J \u2212 21 J\u2206+ B, E3 = \u2212B\u2212 J \u2212 12 J\u2206\u2212 3JD,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nE4 = \u2212B \u2212 J \u2212 21 J\u2206 + 3JD, E5 = B \u2212 J \u2212 12 J\u2206 \u2212 3JD,\n\u221a\nE6 = B \u2212 J \u2212 21 J\u2206 + 3JD, E7 = 32 J\u2206 \u2212 3B, respectively.\nFor a system in thermal equilibrium, the density matrix\n\u03c1(T ) = exp(\u2212\u03b2H)/Z, where \u03b2 = 1/kBT (kB is Boltzmann's\nconstant, which we set it equal to 1) and Z = T r[exp(\u2212\u03b2H)]\nis the partition function. Hence, in this model, we have\n\u03c1(T ) =\n\n7\n1X\nexp(\u2212\u03b2Ei )|\u03c6i ih\u03c6i |,\nZ i=0\n\n(3)\n\nP\nwith Z = 7i=0 exp(\u2212\u03b2Ei ). The two-qubit reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing all but the first two spins, namely,\n\u03c112 (T ) = T r3 [\u03c1(T )]. Due to the periodic boundary conditions,\nit is easy to check that all of the reduced matrices are equal.\nIn the standard basis {|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} the density matrix\n\u03c112 (T ) is given by\n\nwhere\nu = 3 exp (\u22123\u03b2B) + exp [\u03b2(2J\u2206 \u2212 B)][exp (\u22122\u03b2J)\n\u221a\n+2 cosh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J)],\nv = 3 exp (3\u03b2B) + exp [\u03b2(2J\u2206 + B)][exp (\u22122\u03b2J)\n\u221a\n+2 cosh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J)],\nw = 2 cosh(\u03b2B) exp (2\u03b2J\u2206)[exp (\u22122\u03b2J)\n\u221a\n+2 cosh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J)],\ny = 2 cosh(\u03b2B) exp (2\u03b2J\u2206)[exp (\u22122\u03b2J) \u2212\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncosh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J) \u2212 i 3 sinh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J)],\nZ \u2032 = cosh(3\u03b2B) + cosh(\u03b2B) exp (2\u03b2J\u2206)[exp (\u22122\u03b2J)\n\u221a\n+2 cosh( 3\u03b2JD) exp (\u03b2J)],\n(5)\nand y\u2217 represents the complex conjugation of y. Quantum discord of this state is called pairwise thermal quantum discord.\nIn the paper we normalize the coupling constant between spins\nto J = \u22121 for the ferromagnetic case and J = 1 for the antiferromagnetic case and study QD for the two cases separately.\n\nIII.\n\nTHERMAL QUANTUM DISCORD\n\nThe quantum discord, which measures the quantum correlation of bipartite system \u03c1AB , is defined as difference of two\nversions of quantum mutual information [3],\nQ(\u03c1AB ) = I(\u03c1AB ) \u2212 C(\u03c1AB ),\n\n(6)\n\nI(\u03c1AB ) = S (\u03c1A ) + S (\u03c1B) \u2212 S (\u03c1AB),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nis the quantum mutual information, which measures the total\ncorrelation of system \u03c1AB .

In Fig. 1, we plot\nQD as a function of DM interaction while other parameters are\nfixed (T = 0.9, B = 0). In the ferromagnetic case (J = \u22121), as\nincreasing D, QD decreases to a minimum value first and then\nincreases to 0.3984. When D \u2192 +\u221e, the density matrix (3) is\ngiven by \u03c1 = 21 (|\u03c64 ih\u03c64 | + |\u03c66 ih\u03c66 |) for any finite temperature,\nthe pairwise QD of this state is 0.3984. We notice that QD\nmay indicate abrupt change of groundstate. When we set B =\n0, and \u2206 = 2, the groundstate depends on D, it may be\n\nthe anisotropy parameter at finite temperature. In Fig. 2,\nwe plot how QD depends on anisotropy parameter for T =\n0.6 and zero magnetic field. Pairwise thermal entanglement of three-qubit Heisenberg model has been considered\nin Ref. [31]. The authors found that thermal entanglement\nis absent from both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic XXZ model with anisotropy parameter \u2206 \u2265 1. However,\nthere do exist nonzero values of QD in the vicinity of \u2206 \u2265 1.\nOnce again we observe the abrupt change points in the plots.\nThis behavior has been observed in N\u2212qubit XXZ model [10].\nIt is argued that abrupt change of QD in the critical point of\nN\u2212qubit XXZ model is related to the maximization process\nof QD. The calculation shows that the groundstate\nabruptly\n\u221a\nchanges at critical point \u2206 = 1 when D < 3. Hence \u221awe\nnotice QD abruptly changes on the point\n\u221a \u2206 = 1 for D < 3.\nWhen D = 2, the critical point is \u2206 = 3 \u2212 0.5 \u2248 1.2321 near\nthe abrupt change point of dot-dashline. The critical points\nwe obtained may be not the exact point in the plot. This is\nbecause the energy gap between groundstate and first excited\nstate is small. As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the abrupt change of\ndotted line (D = 1.5) shift from the critical point, this is because first excited state is close to the groundstate, the energy\ngap is \u2206E = E4 \u2212 E0 \u2248 0.4019. Comparing with ferromagnetic case, the QD of antiferromagnetic case behaves in a less\ndifferent way as tuning the anisotropy parameter other than\nthe abrupt change points are located on the different points.\nOne can readily check that the abrupt change of QD is related\nto abrupt change of groundstate. Fig. 2 shows QD increases to\nfixed values with J\u2206 in both cases. The state of system would\nbe 12 (|\u03c60 ih\u03c60 + |\u03c67 ih\u03c67 |) when J\u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, thus QD vanishes.\nWe now turn to characterize the dependence of QD on magnetic field B. It is easy to check that invariance of QD under\nmagnetic filed B \u2194 \u2212B. We just discuss the positive magnetic\nfield B. Fig. 3(a)\u22123(b) show the behavior of QD of systems\nwithout DM interaction as changing B.

Raising temperature mixes the groundstate with excited state. Thus\n\u221a QD abruptly changes in the plot nearby the\npoint D = 5/ 3 \u2248 2.8868. In the antiferromagnetic case\n(J = 1), QD increases rapidly as D increasing, then tends to\na fixed value. It is easy to check that the density matrix (3) is\n1\n2 (|\u03c63 ih\u03c63 | +|\u03c65 ih\u03c65 |) at any finite temperature when D \u2192 +\u221e,\nand the pairwise QD of this state is also equal to 0.3984.

By applying magnetic\nfield, the value of QD supplemented with DM interaction may\nhave a more larger range than the cases without DM interaction. However, QD finally vanishes as B increases, namely,\nstrong magnetic field is harmful to QD.

The\ndynamics of three qubits interacting independently with individual environments is described by the solutions of the appropriate Born-Markov-Lindblad equations [32], which can\nalso be obtained by so called the Kraus operator approach [1].\nGiven the initial state \u03c1(0), its evolution equation can be written as\nX\n\u2020\n,\n(11)\n\u03c1(t) =\nE\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c4 \u03c1(0)E\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c4\n\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c4\n\nwhere the Kraus operators, E\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c4 = E\u03b1 \u2297E\u03b2 \u2297E\u03c4 [1] satisfy the\nP\n\u2020\nE\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c4 = I.

We notice that the derivative,\ndQ/d\u03b3, of dot-dash line (D = 3) in Fig. 4(a) abruptly changes\naround a point. The similar behavior is observed in the antiferromagnetic system with nonzero D. The QD regardless of its\ninitial value only disappear in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 1. Fig. 5(a)\u22125(d)\nshows the behavior of quantum discord and entanglement with\nvariation of D and \u03b3 for fixed temperature T = 0.5 and\n\u2206 = 0.5. QD decreases to zero when \u03b3 = 1 (t \u2192 \u221e) in\nboth cases of J. Obviously, entanglement (C) decreases linearly with \u03b3 for fixed D in the plot Fig. 5(b)\u22125(d), it undergoes\na sudden death regardless of J and initial value of C at finite\ntime.\n\nThe depolarizing channel is an important type of quantum\nnoise, it describes the process in which the density matrix is\ndynamically replaced by the state I/2, I denoting identity matrix of a qubit.

We use the same procedure\nas above to evaluate QD and entanglement numerically. As\nshown in Fig. 4(c)\u22124(d), QD decreases more fast under this\ntype of noisy than dephasing channel. The derivative, dQ/d\u03b3,\nis continuous when qubits couple to this quantum channel,\nwhich is different from the case that qubit couples to dephasing channel. In Fig. 6(a)\u22126(d) we plot the quantum discord\nand entanglement for the variation of D and \u03b3. When system couples to this kind of quantum noisy, entanglement once\nagain disappears at finite time but QD does not.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, We investigated the properties of thermal\nquantum discord within three-qubit Heisenberg model supplemented with DM interaction. We found that the DM interaction can both decrease and increase quantum correlation\nin the ferromagnetic XXZ system, but just increase quantum\ncorrelation rapidly in the antiferromagnetic XXZ system. The\nabrupt change of QD was observed as tuning parameters such\n\n\f5\nas D and \u2206, which implies QD may signal the abrupt change\nof groundstate. The effects of magnetic fields on quantum discord were also considered. Our result shows strong magnetic\nsuppresses quantum correlation, while weak magnetic can increase or decrease QD by controlling J\u2206. We utilized thermal\nstate as initial condition to calculate the dynamics of pairwise\nQD under Markovian environments. We found pairwise entanglement of thermal state may occur sudden death but QD\nis robust enough to disappear in asymptotic time.\n\n[1] M. A. Nielsen and I. L.
