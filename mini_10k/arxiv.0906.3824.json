The line profiles of the stars with ve sin i below a few km s\u22121 can reveal direct signatures of local velocity fields such as\nconvection in stellar atmospheres. This effect is well established in cool main sequence stars, and has been detected and studied in\nthree A stars.\nAims. This paper reports observations of main sequence B, A and F stars (1) to identify additional stars with sufficiently low values of\nve sin i to search for spectral line profile signatures of local velocity fields, and (2) to explore how the signatures of the local velocity\nfields in the atmosphere depend on stellar parameters such as effective temperature and peculiarity type.\nMethods. We have carried out a spectroscopic survey of B and A stars of low ve sin i at high resolution. Comparison of model spectra\nwith those observed allows us to detect signatures of the local velocity fields such as asymmetric excess line wing absorption, best-fit\nve sin i parameter values that are found to be larger for strong lines than for weak lines, and discrepancies between observed and\nmodelled line profile shapes.\nResults. Symptoms of local atmospheric velocity fields are always detected through a non-zero microturbulence parameter for main\nsequence stars having T e below about 10000 K, but not for hotter stars. Direct line profile tracers of the atmospheric velocity field are\nfound in six very sharp-lined stars in addition to the three reported earlier. Direct signatures of velocity fields are found to occur in A\nstars with and without the Am chemical peculiarities, although the amplitude of the effects seems larger in Am stars. Velocity fields\nare also directly detected in spectral line profiles of A and early F supergiants, but without significant line asymmetries.\nConclusions. We confirm that several atmospheric velocity field signatures, particularly excess line wing absorption which is stronger\nin the blue line wing than in the red, are detectable in the spectral lines of main sequence A stars of sufficiently low ve sin i. We triple\nthe sample of A stars known to show these effects, which are found both in Am and normal A stars. We argue that the observed line\ndistortions are probably due to convective motions reaching the atmosphere. These data still have not been satisfactorily explained by\nmodels of atmospheric convection, including numerical simulations.\nKey words. convection \u2013 stars:atmospheres \u2013 stars:chemically peculiar \u2013 stars:abundances \u2013 stars:rotation \u2013 line:profiles\n\n1. Introduction\nIt has been known for many years that the spectral line profiles of\nsharp-line cool main sequence stars similar to the Sun are asymmetric. When the observed line profiles of such stars are compared to symmetric theoretical profiles, it is apparent that the observed profiles in general have a slightly deeper long-wavelength\nwing compared to the short-wavelength wing. This asymmetry\nis often described by means of a line bisector (a curve bisecting\nhorizontally the observed absorption profile). Such line bisectors in general have the approximate form of a left parenthesis\n\"(\". The line bisectors of these stars are usually described as\n\"C\"-shaped.\nSend offprint requests to: J. D. Landstreet\n\u22c6\nBased in part on observations obtained at the Canada-FranceHawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research\nCouncil of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of\nthe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the\nUniversity of Hawaii.\n\u22c6\u22c6\nBased in part on observations made at Observatoire de Haute\nProvence (CNRS), France.\n\nThis effect is readily visible in a large number of lower main\nsequence stars because many such stars have the very low projected rotational velocity values (ve sin i \u2264 5 \u2212 8 km s\u22121 ) required\nfor the effect to be detectable at reasonable resolving power\n(\u223c 105 ) and signal-to-noise ratio (S NR \u223c 200\u2212500). A large survey of bisector curvature among cool stars (spectral type mid-F\nand later) of luminosity classes II\u2013V is reported by Gray (2005).\nSuch line asymmetry is generally interpreted as evidence for\nthe presence of an asymmetric convective velocity field in the\nstellar photosphere, with most of the atmosphere rising slowly\n(and thus slightly blue-shifted), while over a small fraction of the\nphotosphere there are relatively rapid downdrafts (thus slightly\nred-shifted). The observed combination of the spectral lines\nfrom these two regions leads to integrated line profiles dominated by the slowly rising material but showing weak red-shifted\nabsorption wings from the downdrafts, and line bisectors with a\nroughly \"C\" shaped profile.\nThis qualitative picture is strongly supported by 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations of the convection in the outer\nlayers of cool stars. Such calculations exhibit the expected behaviour of large slowly rising gas flows that are balanced by\nmore rapid downflows over more limited regions, and in fact the\n\n\f2\n\nJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\npredicted line profiles are in very good agreement with observed\nprofiles (e.g. Dravins & Nordlund 1990; Asplund et al. 2000;\nAllende Prieto, Asplund, L\u00f3pez & Lambert 2002; Steffen et al.\n2006; Ludwig & Steffen 2008).\nUntil recently little was known about the situation farther up\nthe main sequence, mainly because above an effective temperature of T e \u223c 7000 K, most main sequence stars have ve sin i\nvalues on the order of 102 km s\u22121 , which is much larger than the\n\u223c 1 \u2212 10 km s\u22121 values of cool stars. This rotational broadening completely overwhelms any bisector curvature. In a study of\nbisector curvature of cooler stars, Gray & Nagel (1989) noted\nthat one Am (A8V) star, HD 3883, exhibits \"reversed\" bisector\ncurvature; that is, that the depressed line wing is on the shortwavelength side of the line rather than on the long-wavelength\nside. They also found such reversed bisectors in several giants\nand supergiants lying on the hot side of a line in the HR diagram\nrunning from about F0 on the main sequence to G1 for type Ib\nsupergiants. Gray & Nagel argued that their data are evidence\nfor a \"granulation boundary\" in the HR diagram, with convective motions on the hot side of this boundary being structurally\ndifferent from those on the cool side.\nThis picture was extended by Landstreet (1998), who\nsearched for A and late B stars (\"tepid\" stars) of very low ve sin i,\nand then carefully modelled the line profiles of such stars. He\ndiscovered two Am stars and one normal A star that show clear\nreversed bisectors, but found that this effect is absent from late\nB stars. Landstreet further established that reversed bisectors\nappear to correlate well with the presence of measurably nonzero microturbulence. Consistent with the results of testing theoretical model atmospheres for convective instability using the\nSchwarzschild criterion, this microturbulence dies out at about\nA0. There is thus a second \"granulation boundary\" in the HR\ndiagram, above which granulation (and apparent photospheric\nconvection) is absent.\nLandstreet also showed that the line profiles of strong spectral lines in the late A (Am) stars are very different from those\npredicted by line synthesis using the simple model of symmetric Gaussian microturbulence, and argued that such line profiles\ncarry a considerable amount of information about stellar photospheric velocity fields.\nRecently the first 3D numerical simulations of convection\nin A stars have been carried out by Steffen, Freytag & Ludwig\n(2006) (see also Freytag & Steffen 2004 and the earlier simulations in 2D by Freytag, Steffen & Ludwig 1996). These 3D\nnumerical simulations show line profile distortions with approximately the right amplitude (bisector spans of 1 \u2013 2 km s\u22121 compared to observed values about twice that large for T e \u223c 8000 K),\nbut the depressed line wing is the long-wavelength one, as in the\nsolar case. There is currently no theoretical explanation of the\nobserved depressed blue line wings in A stars, or indeed anywhere on the hot side of the granulation boundary. (Note that\nTrampedach [2004] has also carried out computations of convection in the outer envelope of an A9 star, without computing\nline profiles, but at this temperature it is quite possible that the\nstar lies on the low temperature side of the granulation boundary.)\nAt present, empirical information about velocity fields in\nmain sequence A and B stars is very limited. For most such stars,\nthe only information available is what can be deduced from the\nmicroturbulence velocity parameter. Useful local line profile information is available for only a handful of A and late B stars.\nFurthermore, the best available theoretical models do not predict\nthe observed line asymmetries. In these circumstances, it would\nbe very useful to have more stars in which line asymmetries are\n\nvisible directly, both to study how convective phenomena vary\nwith stellar parameters such as mass, T e and spectral peculiarity,\nand to have a larger sample of observed profiles with which to\ncompare the new generation of numerical simulations now being\nproduced.\nConsequently, we have carried out a survey of A and B stars\n(mostly on or near the main sequence) with the goal of identifying more stars with sufficiently small ve sin i values that the\natmospheric velocity field affects observed line profiles. As stars\nof really small ve sin i are found, we have modelled them to determine what symptoms of velocity fields are contained in the\nprofiles. We have also determined a number of parameters, including effective temperature T e , gravity log g, abundances of a\nfew elements, accurate values of ve sin i, and (where possible) the\nmicroturbulence parameter \u03be, for the full dataset presented here.\nThe goal of this survey is to provide a significantly larger, and\nreasonably homogeneous, body of observations that may be used\nto expand our knowledge of velocity fields in the atmospheres of\nA and late B stars.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nThe principal difficulty in detecting and studying the effects\nof photospheric convection (or other local velocity fields) on\nline profiles in A and B stars on or near the main sequence is\nthat most have rotation velocities of the order of 102 \u2212 3 102\nkm s\u22121 . In this situation, most velocity effects on the local line\nprofiles are obliterated by the rotational broadening. The single effect that persists even at high ve sin i is the requirement for\nnon-zero microturbulence (characterised by the microturbulence\nparameter \u03be), needed to force abundance determinations using\nboth weak and strong lines to yield the same abundance values.\nThis parameter is widely thought to be a proxy for the presence\nof photospheric convection; Landstreet (1998) has shown that\namong main sequence A and B stars, \u03be goes to zero at approximately the same effective temperature (around 10500 K) where\nthe Schwarzschild instability criterion applied to Kurucz (e.g.\n1979) model atmospheres shows that the atmospheres become\nmarginally or fully stable against convection. (Note that convection becomes energetically unimportant in the construction of\nsuch model atmospheres, because it is so inefficient that it carries negligible heat, at a substantially lower T e value, \u223c 8250 K,\nand is usually neglected above this temperature.) The microturbulence parameter is essentially the only kind of observational\ninformation available at present for the study of atmospheric\nconvection in most main sequence A and B stars.\nHowever, a few tepid stars do have small enough values of\nve sin i, less than a few km s\u22121 , for the effects of the velocity\nfield of surface convection to be directly detectable in the observed line profiles. Three A stars (two Am stars and one normal\none) in which the effects of local velocity fields are visible in\nthe lines have been identified and studied by Landstreet (1998);\nthree other late B or early A stars (two HgMn stars and one normal star) were also found, in which neither microturbulence nor\nline profile distortions (relative to simple models) reveal any hint\nof photospheric convection. These data suggest that convection\nbecomes detectable in line profiles of main sequence stars below\nT e \u223c 10000 K, but clearly with a sample so small, conclusions\nmust be rather provisional. An essential first step to drawing\nmore secure conclusions from observations is to obtain a larger\nsample of stars in which velocity fields can be studied directly\nin the line profiles.\nIn order to enlarge the sample of main sequence A and B\nstars of very low ve sin i which may be studied, we have car-\n\n\fJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\nried out a substantial observational survey. In spite of the large\nnumber of ve sin i values for A and B main sequence stars in the\ncurrent literature (see for example Abt & Morrell 1995; Levato\net al. 1996; Wolff & Simon 1997; Abt, Levato & Grosso 2002;\nand references therein), a survey was necessary because most of\nthe available observations of rotational velocities of early-type\nstars have been carried out with a spectral resolving power R of\nthe order of 1\u20133 104 . This resolving power is insufficient to determine the value of ve sin i if it is less than 10\u201320 km s\u22121 . Since\nLandstreet (1998) found that direct detection of velocity fields in\nline profiles requires ve sin i to be less than about 5 to 10 km s\u22121 ,\nnew observations were required to identify stars satisfying this\ncriterion.\nTo have adequate resolving power to identify stars with\nve sin i values below a few km s\u22121 , we have used the highresolution spectrograph Aur\u00e9lie on the 1.52-m telescope at the\nObservatoire de Haute Provence (OHP) in France, and Gecko at\nthe 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Both have\nR \u2248 1.2 105. Spectra obtained with these instruments can measure ve sin i values down to about 2 km s\u22121 . This resolving power\nis sufficient to (barely) resolve the thermal line width of Fe\npeak elements, which have mean thermal velocities of about\n1.7 km s\u22121 , and thus FWHM line widths of about 3 km s\u22121 .\nBoth spectrographs are cross-dispersed echelle instruments, but\nin each, only one order is observed, so that observations record\nonly a single wavelength window, typically 30 to 80 \u00c5 in length,\ndepending on the detector used.\nObserving missions were carried out at OHP in 1993, 1994\nand 1995. For all missions, a small window covering 4615\n\u2013 4645 \u00c5 was used, isolated by a custom interference filter.\nObservations were carried out at CFHT in 1993 and twice in\n1995, using the same observing window, and also a window covering 5150 \u2013 5185 \u00c5. The data from these runs have been discussed by Landstreet (1998). Further missions were carried out\nin 2000 and 2001 at CFHT, both to look for more very sharpline A and B stars, and to increase the available data for stars\nalready identified as particularly interesting. For these runs, a\nlarger CCD was available, and windows at 4525 \u2013 4590 \u00c5 (in\n2000) and 4535 \u2013 4600 \u00c5 (in 2001) were isolated by a grism.\nCandidate stars for observation were largely chosen from\nstars which are reported to have values of ve sin i below about 15\n\u2013 20 km s\u22121 in previous surveys of rotational velocity (see references above). Although these surveys lack the resolving power\nto identify directly the stars of most interest here, they do constitute a first sorting which select the few percent of all early\ntype main sequence stars that may be really sharp-lined; without these surveys to guide us, the required observing programme\nwould have been more than ten times larger.\nMost of the stars observed are B, A, and early F main sequence stars, although a few bright giants and supergiants were\nalso observed. Examples from the Am and HgMn peculiarity\ngroups were included in the survey. All the stars observed are\nbrighter than about V \u2248 7, since this is the effective limiting\nmagnitude of most of the previous ve sin i surveys available. The\nspectra obtained typically have signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nthe order of 200 in the continuum. Stars that are found to have\nvery small ve sin i values are likely to be members of close binary\nsystems, which may not have been previously noticed, and so the\nstars of greatest interest to us, with ve sin i below 8 \u2013 10 km s\u22121 ,\nwere mostly observed more than once to test for the presence of\na secondary in the observable spectrum.\nSpectra were reduced using standard IRAF tasks: CCD\nframes were corrected for bias and bad pixels and extracted to\n\n3\n\n1D; the 1D spectra were divided by similarly extracted flat field\nexposures; a polynomial was fit to continuum points to normalise\nthe continuum to 1.0; the spectra were wavelength calibrated, using typically 30 ThAr lines which are fit to an RMS accuracy of\nabout 3 10\u22124 \u00c5; finally, the spectra were corrected to a heliocentric reference frame.\nThe stars from this observing programme that have been\nfound to have ve sin i values below about 15 km s\u22121 , so that\nvelocity field effects are potentially detectable in the line profiles, are listed in Table 1. This table provides two names for\neach star, a spectral type (generally obtained through the Simbad\ndatabase), an indication of binarity (either from the literature\nor from our own observations), T e and log g (obtained by using available Str\u00f6mgren uvby and/or Geneva photometry together with the FORTRAN calibration programmes described\nby Napiwotzki, Sch\u00f6nberner & Wenske (1993: uvby) and by\nK\u00fcnzli, North, Kurucz & Nicolet (1997: Geneva)). The final\ncolumns contain results from our own analysis that will be described below.\nMost stars in the survey were of course found to have values\nof ve sin i large enough that we are not able to detect directly the\nlocal velocity fields in the rotationally broadened line profiles.\nFor such stars, we nevertheless determined a few abundances,\nand accurate ve sin i and sometimes \u03be values. Some results for\nthese stars are reported in Table 1, but these stars are not discussed individually any further in this paper.\n\n3. Treatment of double-line spectroscopic binaries\nSeveral of the stars in the present sample, noted as SB2 in\nTable 1, are observed to be double-lined spectroscopic binaries.\nTo study the primaries of such systems, it is very useful to subtract the secondary spectrum from the observed composite spectrum. This is not essential for determination of the rotation velocity of the primary (as long as we are careful to avoid lines\nsignificantly blended by the secondary star), but determination\nof the microturbulence parameter \u03be rests on line-by-line abundance measurements, which in turn require that the line depths\nof the primary spectrum be correctly normalised.\nIn the cases of greatest interest, the secondary is found from\nneutral/ion line ratios to be a mid or late A spectral type of very\nlow ve sin i. We have previously found (Landstreet 1998) that\nthe line profiles of the stronger lines in such stars are not correctly described by the standard line model with thermal broadening, damping, and height-independent Gaussian microturbulence. Thus, it is not practical to compute a synthetic spectrum of the secondary which we could subtract from the primary. Furthermore, for none of the systems studied here do we\nhave enough information available (either from the literature or\nfrom our own data) to be able to determine accurately the secondary/primary light ratio in our short observational windows.\nHowever, we have found that the secondary spectra in the\nfour stars of particular interest are all very similar to the observed spectra of the very sharp-lined Am stars HD 108642 and\nHD 209625, previously studied by Landstreet (1998). In all cases\nthe secondary spectrum is almost unbroadened by rotation. This\nsuggests that a simple method of correcting approximately the\ncomposite spectra for the effects of the secondary would be to\nDoppler shift an observed spectrum of one of these two Am stars\nto coincide with the secondary spectrum, subtract it, and renormalise the resulting spectrum. Experiments have shown that this\nprocedure in fact removes the secondary spectrum from the observed composite spectrum, leaving a residual noise in the difference spectrum which is roughly proportional to the depth of the\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

This procedure also allows us to identify with some certainty which lines of the primary spectrum are\nsignificantly blended with secondary lines, so that we can avoid\nincluding these lines in our detailed analysis of profile shapes.\nIn general, it would be necessary to Doppler shift each pixel\nof the \"template\" secondary star individually, and then resample the template star to the pixel spacing of the composite spectrum. In our particular case, however, we have spectra of either\nHD 108642 or HD 209625 taken with exactly the same instrumental settings used for the SB2 which is to be corrected, and it\nis found by experiment that it is adequate to simply shift the\nentire template spectrum by the integer number of pixels required for the mean Doppler shift, and subtract the template from\nthe composite spectrum pixel by pixel. This is possible because\n(a) the spectrum windows used are sufficiently short (less than\n100 \u00c5 at 4500 \u00c5) and (b) because the pixel spacing of the data\nis small enough (about 0.016 \u00c5).

An example of this procedure is shown in Figure 1. It will be seen that the correction of\nthe primary spectrum for individual spectral features of the secondary component is good but not perfect (especially near the\nred end of the spectrum); however, it is clear which lines in the\nprimary are contaminated by lines of the secondary.\nIt is clear that this procedure does not ensure an accurate determination of the light contribution of the secondary to the total\ncomposite spectrum, but only an estimate of this contribution.\nHowever, the uncertainty arising from this effect (essentially in\nthe determination of the zero point of the flux in the extracted\nprimary spectrum) is not very large. Typically it is found that\nthe secondary template star contributes about 10% of the light\n\n\fJ. D.

An example of subtraction of the secondary in an SB2 system. The figure shows the original spectrum of HD 103578 in the\n4530 \u00c5 window (middle spectrum, displaced upwards by 0.1 for clarity); the spectrum of HD 108642 renormalised and pixel-shifted\nto match the secondary in the HD 103578 system as well as possible (top spectrum, shifted upwards from initial spectrum by 0.03);\nand the final spectrum of HD 103578A produced by subtraction of the scaled and shifted spectrum of HD 108642 followed by\nrenormalisation to a continuum value of 1.0 (lower spectrum).\n\nto the composite. Since the lines of the template stars, which always fit the profiles of the secondary star rather accurately, are\nvirtually unbroadened by rotation and therefore quite deep (the\nBa II line at 4554.03 \u00c5 descends to below 0.2 of the continuum), the amount of light contributed by the secondary will not\nbe overestimated by more than about 10% at the worst, or about\n1% of the total flux in the composite spectrum. Similarly, if we\nassume that the secondary in the composite SB2 spectrum has\nat least roughly solar composition, its strongest lines, which are\nhighly saturated, should be about as deep as those of the template spectrum. Again, it appears that a 10% underestimate of\nthe secondary's contribution to the total light is unlikely, which\nagain leads to an overall uncertainty after subtraction of roughly\n1% of the continuum in the residual spectrum. This is comparable to the uncertainty caused by correction for scattered light\nin the composite spectrum, and will not lead to a substantially\nincreased error in either abundance determinations or in the microturbulence parameter \u03be.\n\nserved spectrum. Thus we suspect that the secondary spectrum\nis absent either because its lines are extremely broad, or because\nthey are extremely narrow and coincide with those of the primary. We see no trace of broad lines in our (blue) spectra, so\nmost probably the lines of the secondary are very narrow, and\nwe must be concerned about how they influence our analysis.\nIf weak secondary lines are present on the blue wing of each\nprimary line, these contaminating lines could perhaps produce\nexcess blue wing absorption in strong lines (or in most lines),\nand line profiles that do not closely match computed ones. It is\nnot clear that such contamination could lead to strong lines that\nrequire a larger value of ve sin i for best fit compared to weak\nlines. Clearly, caution must be exercised in interpreting spectra\nof HD 114330, and our conclusions cannot rest on this star alone.\n\nThe case of HD 114330 requires individual discussion. From\nspeckle observations there is a visual secondary about 0.45 arcsec from the primary, approximately 2 mag fainter than the primary, and of similar or slightly higher T e (e.g. Ten Brummelaar\net al. 2000). However, there is no trace of this component in\nthe observed spectrum. Because image slicers were used in both\nspectrographs with which data were obtained for this project,\nlight from this component almost certainly is part of the ob-\n\nTo uncover the information encoded in the observed spectral\nlines of a star about the atmospheric velocity field(s) present,\nwe must compare the observed spectrum to a computed spectrum which incorporates some model velocity fields, typically\nthermal broadening, the rotational velocity ve sin i, and the standard model of height-independent Gaussian microturbulence.\nThe first step in this process, so that we can select an (approximately) appropriate atmosphere model from a precomputed grid\n\n4.

The agreement of the inferred values of log g was worse,\ntypically 0.2\u20130.3 dex, presumably because the Geneva system\ndoes not have a narrow-band filter equivalent to the H\u03b2 filter of\nthe Str\u00f6mgren system, and thus is less sensitive to gravity (for\nhot stars) and more sensitive to interstellar reddening (for cool\nstars). We generally adopted a value of log g close to the value\ngiven by the Str\u00f6mgren calibration.\nFor SB2 stars, approximate values of T e and log g were found\nusing the combined light. We tried to improve these values by\nvarying the assumed values of T e and log g to see if the quality\nof the fit to our spectral windows was significantly improved by\na somewhat different choice of these fundamental parameters,\nbut for all the stars of interest we were unable to determine more\naccurately the fundamental parameters of the primary star from\nour short spectra. We therefore retained the estimates obtained\nusing the combined light, which in general probably yield values\nof T e that are slightly too high, perhaps by 1\u20132%.\nThe observed spectra of the stars in our sample have been\nmodelled using the FORTRAN programme zeeman.f (version\nzabn4.f), described by Landstreet (1988) and Landstreet et al.\n(1989), and compared to other magnetic line synthesis codes by\nWade et al. (2001). This is nearly the same programme that was\nused in the previous study of line profiles of sharp-line A and\nB stars by Landstreet (1998) except for extensive modifications\nto include the effects of anomalous dispersion for a stellar atmosphere permeated by a magnetic field. These modifications\nhave essentially no impact on the analysis of the present (nonmagnetic) stars.\nZeeman.f makes extensive use of spectral line data obtained\nfrom the Vienna Atomic Line Database (Kupka et al. 2000,\n1999; Ryabchikova et al. 1997; Piskunov et al. 1995).\nA key feature of this programme is that it can be instructed\nto search for an optimum fit to a single chemical element in\none (or several) observed spectra; at the same time, it finds the\nbest fit radial velocity for the spectrum, and the best fit value\nof ve sin i. This fitting is done assuming the standard model of\nheight-independent Gaussian microturbulence, and the fitting sequence can be carried out for a series of different values of microturbulence parameter \u03be to enable the best fitting \u03be to be selected. The programme returns the value of the \u03c72 /\u03bd of the best\nfit (\u03bd is the number of degrees of freedom of the fit), as well as\nthe parameters of the best fit.\nZeeman.f can be used in several somewhat different modes.\nTwo modes were mostly used in this study. In one, we optimise\nthe fit to an element using all the significant lines of that element\nin one entire observed spectrum (30 to 75 \u00c5 long), for a series\nof values of \u03be, selecting in the end the value of \u03be which fits the\nspectrum best, and the corresponding abundance. This method\nonly leads to a determination of \u03be if the spectrum includes spectral lines having a range of strengths, at least some of which are\nsaturated. If all the spectral lines are relatively weak, different\nvalues of \u03be fit the spectrum roughly equally well, up to the value\nat which microturbulence broadens the line by more than its total\nobserved width.\nIn the second mode, we optimise the fit of a set of selected\nspectral lines of one element, one line at a time (i.e. in short win-\n\ndows, typically 1\u20132 \u00c5 wide, around each of the selected lines), as\na function of \u03be, and then plot \"Blackwell diagrams\" (Landstreet\n1998): inferred abundance as a function of \u03be for each spectral\nline separately. If some of the spectral lines used are fairly saturated while others are weak, the resulting curves will usually\nintersect in a well-defined small region, which determines both\nthe best fitting abundance of the element, and the best fit value\nof \u03be. The programme output using this method allows us to examine conveniently the quality of the fit of an individual model\nspectral line to a particular observed line as a function of the\nvarious parameters such as ve sin i and \u03be, and makes it easy to\nsee whether or not the same fitting parameters are derived from\nall spectral lines of one (or several) element(s). Some Blackwell\ndiagrams are shown by Landstreet (1998).\nThe available high-quality spectra for each star have been\nanalysed as described above. In general, we have optimised\nabundances of the principal detectable elements (some of He,\nO, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zr, Ba) as a function of the microturbulence\nparameter \u03be, and chosen the microturbulence parameter value\nwhich yielded the best concordance of abundances derived from\ndifferent spectral lines of one to three elements (usually Ti, Cr,\nand Fe, and sometimes Si) for which enough lines, with a large\nenough range of equivalent width, are available. The deduced\nvalue of \u03be is then used to determine abundances of all other elements.\nThe best-fit values of ve sin i and \u03be, and the abundances of\nSi, Cr, and Fe, with our estimates of uncertainties, are reported\nin Table 1. In cases where the available range of line strengths\nin our spectra was not sufficient to allow us to determine the\nvalue of \u03be we report \"nd \u00b1 nd\" (for \"not detected\"). In a number\nof stars we were only able to obtain upper limits to the values\nof \u03be, usually from Blackwell diagrams, but occasionally from\nthe very narrow line profiles; such cases are reported with equal\nvalues and uncertainties for \u03be (e. g. 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 km s\u22121 ).\nAbundances are given as logarithmic number densities relative to H, because this is essentially what we measure; for many\nstars in our sample the atmospheric abundance of He is unknown (and probably not close to solar), so we prefer to report\nlog(nX /nH ) rather than log(nX /ntot ) values, which requires an ad\nhoc assumption about nHe /nH . Uncertainties in the quoted abundance values are due in part to fitting uncertainties, which arise\nbecause abundances derived from individual spectral lines for a\ngiven value of \u03be always show some scatter about the average,\ndue to imprecise atomic data (especially g f values), to the fact\nthat we do not have a correct model of strong lines with which\nto fit the observations, and to the fact that the atmosphere model\nused is only an approximate description of the actual stellar atmosphere. These fitting uncertainties are typically of the order\nof 0.1 dex in size. There is an additional uncertainty from the\nfact that the fundamental parameters of each star are only known\nwith a limited precision. We assume that the value of T e has an\naccuracy of approximately \u00b13%, and that log g is known to about\n\u00b10.25 dex. We have carried out a number of experiments to test\nthe effect of these uncertainties on the derived abundances, by\nrederiving abundance values after changing T e or log g. Because\nour abundances are generally obtained from the dominant ion,\nthe abundances are not very sensitive to changes in either T e or\nlog g. The uncertainties in fundamental parameters change the\nderived abundances by an amount which varies from element\nto element but is of the order of 0.1 dex. The total uncertainty\ngiven for each abundance in Table 1 is then the sum in quadrature of the individual fitting uncertainty and a fixed uncertainty\nof 0.1 dex arising from fundamental parameter uncertainties.\n\n\fJ.

Microturbulence parameter \u03be as a function of stellar T e\nfor main sequence stars in the sample. Open symbols are normal\nstars, filled squares are Am stars, and filled upright triangles are\nHgMn stars.\n\nNote also that since we do not model macroturbulence, but\ninclude all broadening except for instrumental, thermal, and microturbulent in our ve sin i broadening, the values of ve sin i for\nthe coolest stars of our sample are larger than those given in\nstudies which separate the rotational and macroturbulent components of line broadening.\nFor the stars with the sharpest lines, the precise value of \u03be obtained by our fitting procedure may not be the same as the value\nfound by other methods, even with the same observational material and atomic data. This is because we fit line profiles using\na \u03c72 minimisation procedure rather than fitting equivalent width.\nAs will be seen below (and was discovered by Landstreet 1998),\nfor the sharp-line A stars the standard line profile model with microturbulence does not fit the profiles of some very strong lines\nat all well, effectively showing that this is an inadequate description of these lines. In this situation, it is not clear that there is\nany good reason to prefer one fitting method over the other \u2013\nbut it may well be that in some cases they yield slightly different\nvalues of \u03be.\nWe have compared the basic parameters we have chosen\nfor stars analysed, and the resulting abundance values, with a\nnumber of previous analyses available in the literature (e.g. Hill\n& Landstreet 1993; Adelman et al. 1997; Hui-Bon-Hoa 2000;\nPintado & Adelman 2003; Gebran et al. 2008). In most cases\nour value of T e is within about 200 K, and our log g within\nabout 0.2 dex, of values adopted by other authors. Our values\nof \u03be are mostly in agreement to within 0.5 km s\u22121 or less, and\nour resulting element abundances agree within \u00b10.2 dex. These\ndiscrepancies are fairly typical for the differences between independent abundance analyses of B and A stars, and probably derive from differences in fundamental parameters, detailed model\natmospheres used, choices of g f values and wavelength regions,\netc. The only significant systematic disagreement we find is that\nthe element abundances we derive for the supergiants in our sample are almost always of order -0.3 dex lower than the LTE abundances found by Venn (1995). The origin of this difference has\nnot been identified, but does not affect the analysis of spectral\nline profiles which is the main subject of this paper.\n\nIn our previous study of atmospheric velocity fields in middle\nmain sequence stars (Landstreet 1998), several kinds of observational evidence of velocity fields were studied: strong lines\nwhose profiles departed significantly from those predicted by\nthe standard microturbulence model; significant (in some cases\nquite strong) excess absorption in the blue wings of strong\nlines; deduced rotation velocities ve sin i which increase with\nline equivalent width; and the microturbulence parameter \u03be.\nMicroturbulence has been known and studied for decades, but\nthe other spectral line symptoms of local velocity fields were\nsystematically studied in tepid main sequence stars for the first\ntime in our previous study.\nOne of the results of the spectrum synthesis carried out for\nthe stars of this sample is a determination of the microturbulence parameter \u03be (see Table 1) for all the stars of the sample\nexcept a few hot stars that have no saturated lines in the window(s) observed. The derived values of \u03be are plotted as a function of stellar effective temperature T e in Figure 2, with separate\nsymbols for normal, Am, and HgMn stars. This figure clearly\nshows the expected behaviour: \u03be is zero within the uncertainties\nfor T e \u2265 10 000 K, while below this temperature it rises rapidly\ntowards lower T e to a limiting value which for most stars is approximately 2 km s\u22121 .\nThe peculiar stars of this diagram have quite distinctive behaviour. In none of the Ap HgMn stars is a non-zero value of \u03be\ndetected, consistent with models of these stars that require vertically stratified atmospheres (e.g. Sigut 2001). In contrast, all\nthe metallic-line Am stars have clearly non-zero values of \u03be. For\nthe hotter Am stars (T e \u2265 8 500 K), the value of \u03be is indistinguishable from that of normal stars of the same T e value, but the\ncooler Am stars tend to have \u03be values about 1 to 2 km s\u22121 larger\nthan the values found for normal stars. The relatively large \u03be\nvalues found for the five cool Am stars of the present sample\nare consistent with the results of Landstreet (1998) for a smaller\nsample.\nThe most striking symptom of atmospheric velocities discovered by Landstreet (1998) was the large departure of the\nline profiles of strong spectral lines in a few stars from the profiles predicted by the standard model of a height-independent,\nisotropic Gaussian (microturbulent) velocity field. The velocity\nfield signature takes the form of line profiles of strongly saturated lines that are much more triangular than line profiles predicted by the standard model. Furthermore, these strong lines\nhave substantial excess absorption in the blue line wing relative to synthetic line profiles. Such pointed, asymmetric profiles\nare reminiscent of the line profiles found in slowly rotating cool\nstars, which are modelled by introducing macroturbulence. It is\nclear that such line distortions signal the presence of local atmospheric motions more complex than those assumed by the\nstandard microturbulent model, and provide valuable information about these motions.\nIn the previous study, the phenomenon was only observed\nin very clear form in two stars (HD 108642 and HD 209625)\nwith T e values close to 8000 K, both of which are Am stars.\nOne further normal early A star (HD 72660) was found to show\na very attenuated departure of observed line profiles from computed ones, primarily in the form of observed blue line wings\nthat are slightly depressed below the computed line wings. For\nthe other two stars in that study with T e below 10 000 K, the\nve sin i values are too large for a significant departure from a\npurely rotational profile to be seen. All observed line profiles\nof three very sharp-line stars hotter than T e \u2248 10 000 K were\n\n\f8\n\nJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\nTable 2.

The top three stars are late\nB HgMn stars, while the lower three stars are normal A stars\n(one of which is an SB2). The solid lines show the observed\nline profiles of the strong 4571.97 \u00c5 line of Ti ii (left panel) and\ntwo weak to moderate lines of Fe ii at 4579.53 and 4580.06 \u00c5\n(right panel); the dashed lines show profiles computed with the\nstandard line model of depth-independent, isotropic microturbulence, using the parameters of Table 1.\n\nfound to be in very good agreement with the computed profiles;\nno indication of any atmospheric velocity field other than bulk\nstellar rotation is seen in the lines. As discussed in the introduction, the main goals of the present project are to find more\nexamples of such line profile discrepancies, to discover whether\nthe phenomenon is restricted essentially to Am stars, or is found\nmore generally, and to determine more clearly over what range\nof T e directly observable velocity field symptoms are found.\nIn Figures 3 through 5 we compare the result of detailed\nmodelling of lines of the sharpest-lined main sequence stars\nin the present sample with observed line profiles. Two spectral\nwindows are shown, reflecting the available observational material for the stars of the sample: data in the window around\n4560 \u00c5 were obtained in 2000\u201301, while data in the window\naround 4630 \u00c5 are from earlier observing runs.

The solid lines show the observed line profiles\nof the strong 4634.07 \u00c5 line of Cr ii (left panel) and the weak\n4637.50 \u00c5 line of Fe i and the blend of 4638.01 \u00c5 of Fe i and\n4638.05 \u00c5 of Fe ii (right panel); the dashed lines show profiles\ncomputed with the standard line model of depth-independent,\nisotropic microturbulence, using the parameters of Table 1. The\nbar in the lower left corner of the left panel represents a wavelength shift equivalent to 10 km s\u22121 .\n\nure, the line in the left panel is the strongest spectral line in\nthe observed window that is essentially free from blends in the\nrange of T e of the figure. The right panel shows a relatively\nweak line that is also largely blend-free. These observed lines\nare compared with model spectral lines computed assuming the\nstandard model of velocity broadening due to the atomic thermal velocities, depth-independent, isotropic Gaussian microturbulence, and rigid-body rotation, along with appropriate instrumental broadening.\nAs mentioned above, in stars showing significant line asymmetry, it is also found that the ve sin i value that best fits the\nstrongest lines is almost always significantly larger (by up to\nseveral km s\u22121 ) than that which best fits the weakest lines.\nPresumably this effect reflects the extra contribution of the local\n\n\fJ.

The bar in the lower left\ncorner of the left panel represents a wavelength shift equivalent\nto 10 km s\u22121 .\n\nmacroscopic velocity field to the line width of saturated lines,\nand the true value of ve sin i is (at most) as large as the minimum\nvalue found using the weakest, sharpest lines. In the figures, the\nprojected rotational velocities of the synthetic lines with which\nthese observed lines are compared are determined using only the\nweakest lines, and the same ve sin i value is used for all lines of\neach star. The value of \u03be used is the value reported in Table 1,\nderived from the abundance modelling of weak and strong lines.\nThese three figures clearly display the same phenomena\nidentified by Landstreet (1998): no trace of macroscopic velocity fields above about 10 000 K, while below that temperature \u03be\nrises rapidly from zero, and particularly sharp-lined stars show\nve sin i values that depend on line strength, line asymmetries, and\nsignificant discrepancies between computed and observed line\nprofiles of strong lines.\nFor each of the four stars in Figure 3 with effective temperatures above about 10 000 K (HD 186122, 178065, 175640, and\n181470A, the first three of which are Ap HgMn stars), the value\nof \u03be is not significantly different from zero. The same value of\nve sin i fits weak and strong lines, and in all cases the fit is very\ngood to both weak and strong lines, which are clearly symmetric.\nThese stars show no significant trace of local large-scale velocity fields such as \"macroturbulence\". The same result was found\nfor the normal star HD 209459 = 21 Peg (T e = 10200 K) by\nLandstreet (1998).\nOf the seven stars in these figures with T e between 9 000 K\nand 10 000 K, the four with ve sin i below 6 km s\u22121 (HD 2421A,\nHD 72660, HD 114330, and HD 157486A) show small but clear\ndeviations from the synthesized line profiles, specifically depression of the observed blue line wing relative to the computed line\n\n9\n\nfor the strong (but not the weak) lines. In contrast, the two stars\nwith ve sin i \u223c 10 km s\u22121 (HD 73666 and 47105), and the one\nstar of ve sin i = 7 km s\u22121 observed with R = 40 000 show no\ndetectable effect, even though their \u03be values are comparable to\nthose of HD 2421 and HD 157486; for these stars the small velocities of the local velocity field are concealed by the rotational\nand/or instrumental broadening.\nThere are six sharp-line stars in the sample with T e in the\nrange 7 500 to 9 000 K: HD 27962, HD 103578A, HD 107168,\nHD 108642, HD 189849, and HD 209625. (Two of these are the\ntwo Am stars studied by Landstreet 1998.) In this temperature\nrange the local velocity field amplitude is large enough to be\nclearly visible even with ve sin i above 10 km s\u22121 (HD 27962 and\n107168, but not in HD 189849 for which our observational material is of low quality), and, as previously found, in stars with\nsharper lines the impact of the local velocity field is really striking. In HD 103578A, 108642 and 209625 the deviations from\nthe model are clearly visible even in the weak lines used to determine ve sin i. In these stars the discrepancy between the calculated and observed line profiles is very substantial for the strong\nlines, both in the core shapes and in the occurrence of observed\nblue line wings that are shallower and deeper than the computed\nones. In HD 27962 and 107168, both of which have ve sin i values above 10 km s\u22121 , the effects are visible but not striking.\nFinally, we also show two F stars in Figure 5 whose T e values are below 7 000 K (HD 185395 and HD 61421), and which\nshow the well-known shape discrepancies of solar-type stars in\nthe strong lines, with the red line wings of the strong observed\nlines shallower than and depressed below the model profile. Note\nthat the line profiles of A-type stars with depressed blue wings\nas shown in Figure 5 are very different from the blueward hook\nphenomenon which has been observed for F-type stars such as\nProcyon and explained to originate from saturation of strong\nlines in upflow regions (Allende Prieto et al. 2002). The cool\nstar blueward hook feature only affects lines close to their continuum level and is much smaller in terms of velocities (less than\n0.5 km s\u22121 ).\nTo provide a scale for the velocity amplitude required to account for the line profile distortions, in each figure where these\neffects are apparent we include a small horizontal error bar with\na total width of 10 km s\u22121 .\nA summary of all the main sequence A stars in which we\nfind direct evidence of an atmospheric velocity field (beyond that\nprovided by a non-zero value of \u03be) has been found is given in\nTable 2. Columns 3 to 6 recall the spectral type, binarity, effective temperature and microturbulence parameter of these stars.\nIn the column \"depressed blue wing\" the comment \"weak\" or\n\"strong\" indicates the extent to which the short-wavelength line\nwing is deeper than the long-wavelength wing. The column \"line\nshape discrepancy\" describes qualitatively the extent of discrepancies, other than the depressed blue line wing, between observed and calculated line profiles of the strongest spectral lines.\nThe last two columns list extreme values of ve sin i as derived\nfrom best fits to the weakest and strongest spectral lines in our\nspectra. As discussed qualitatively above, we see that the difference between the best fit ve sin i values for the weakest and\nstrongest lines in our spectra seems to increase quite rapidly for\nT e below about 9000 K to a value that can be several km s\u22121 at\naround 8000 K. (Note that HD 3883, noted by Gray & Nagel\n[1989] as having a reversed bisector, is omitted from Table 2\nbecause we have no spectra of this star.)\nWe notice that the direct evidence of velocity fields in the\nline profiles agrees very well with the indirect evidence provided\nby the microturbulence parameter. Main sequence stars having\n\n\f10\n\nJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\nT e above about 10000 K have \u03be values that are indistinguishable from 0, and thus lack any evidence of small-scale velocity\nfields. These same stars have spectral lines that are in excellent\nagreement with calculated line profiles in which the broadening\nis assumed to be due only to rotation, thermal broadening, collisional damping, and instrumental resolution; these stars thus do\nnot show any direct evidence of local atmospheric hydrodynamic\nmotions.\nIn contrast, stars with T e below 10000 K all have non-zero\nvalues of \u03be, and all the stars with \"sufficiently\" small values of\nve sin i also show direct line profile evidence of velocity fields.\nLocal velocity fields are detectable through differences between\nprofiles of observed strong spectral lines and computed lines,\nthrough asymmetries in the observed lines, and in most cases\nthrough best-fit ve sin i values that are systematically larger for\nstrong than for weak lines. Furthermore, the strongest directly\ndetected symptoms of local velocity fields, observed in stars with\nT e around 8000 K, generally coincide with the largest deduced\nvalues of \u03be.\nThese results confirm the findings from a smaller dataset by\nLandstreet (1998), where it was shown that the range of effective\ntemperatures for which non-zero-values of \u03be are found coincides\nrather closely with the occurrence of a convectively unstable region in the stellar atmosphere as predicted by the Schwarzschild\ncriterion applied to the model atmosphere used for spectrum\nsynthesis. Thus, the occurrence of convective motions in the atmospheres is expected in essentially the range of T e in which\nit is observed. The importance of the observations presented in\nthis paper comes from the direct signatures of this convection in\nspectral lines, which should be able to provide significant constraints on the nature of the actual flows occurring in the atmosphere.\nIt may be noted that the line profile distortions relative to the\ncanonical model are observed essentially only in lines of onceionised atoms such as Fe, Cr and Ti, and not in the few visible\nlines of neutral atoms. This is presumably due to the fact that all\nneutral lines are relatively weak, while the effects we are interested show themselves in strong, heavily saturated lines.\nIt is of interest to compare the symptoms of local velocity\nfields found in the spectra of main sequence stars with those\nfound in lines of supergiants of similar spectral types, and for\nthis reason several of the stars in our survey are such luminous\nobjects. It is well known that A and F supergiants require relatively large values of the microturbulence parameter (typically\nseveral km s\u22121 ) for successful spectrum synthesis (e. g. Venn\n1995; Gray et al. 2001; Przybilla et al. 2006), and so we expect to find strong evidence of velocity fields in the line profiles\nof the slowest rotators.\nFive supergiants, ranging in T e from 9700 to 6800 K, are\nlisted in Table 1 and are shown in Figure 6. As with the main sequence stars, the ve sin i values have been determined using only\nthe weakest lines, and for each star the same value of ve sin i has\nbeen used for all synthesized profiles. A systematic result of our\nuse of only the weakest lines is that the ve sin i values determined\nhere are always significantly smaller than those found in previous studies, where ve sin i is fit mainly to the stronger lines. In\nthe right panel of the figure an example of relatively weak lines\nshows that these profiles are fairly well fit by simple rotational\nbroadening (together with thermal and instrumental broadening\nand classical microturbulence). In contrast, the observed strong\nlines of the left panel are all significantly different in shape from\nthe computed lines. If we had (unphysically) allowed ve sin i to\nbe a free parameter for each spectral line separately, the strong\nlines could have been substantially better fit.

Striking convection signatures in spectral lines of A\nand early F-type supergiants with T e values between 9700 and\n6800 K observed in the 4530 \u2013 4600 \u00c5 window. From top to\nbottom: HD 46300 (13 Mon), HD 87737 (\u03b7 Leo), HD 175687\n(\u03be1 Sgr), HD 147084 (o Sco), and HD 182835 (\u03bd Aql). The solid\nlines show the observed line profiles of the strong 4588.20 \u00c5\nline of Cr ii (left panel) and a group of weak to moderate lines,\n4595.36 and 4596.06 \u00c5 of Fe i and 4595.68 and 4596.02 \u00c5 of\nFe ii (right panel); the dashed lines show theoretical profiles\ncomputed with the standard line model of depth-independent,\nisotropic microturbulence computed with the parameters of\nTable 1. The bar in the lower left corner of the left panel represents a wavelength shift equivalent to 10 km s\u22121 .\n\nbest fit ve sin i value determined from strong lines is a few km s\u22121\nlarger than that found from weak lines, and is similar to values\nfound in other high-resolution studies. In the coolest star shown,\nHD 182835, the best fit ve sin i value found from weak lines is\nno more than 10 km s\u22121 , while the best fit for the strongest lines\nis about 18 km s\u22121 !\nThus, we find in these highly luminous stars evidence for the\nlocal velocity fields phenomenologically similar to that found\nin main sequence stars of similar T e , but with larger amplitude.\nHowever, there is one significant difference: the supergiants do\nnot show the strong line asymmetry seen in the main sequence\nstars with similar temperatures. The depression of the observed\nwings of strong lines below the computed wings is essentially\nthe same on the blue and red sides of the line. This result is different from that of Gray & Toner (1986), who find significant\nexcess absorption in the blue wings of spectral lines of F supergiants. However, their data suggest that the asymmetry diminishes towards earlier spectral types. As their earliest supergiant\nhas spectral type F5 while our latest type is F2, perhaps we are\nsimply seeing the asymmetry decrease below the threshold for\neasy visibility.\nA different possibility for the velocity field observed in supergiants is that the line profiles reveal the presence of pulsations. Aerts et al. (2008) have shown that the qualitatively similar\nline profiles of an early B-type supergiant, typically modelled by\nmacroturbulence, may be produced by numerous low-amplitude\ngravity-mode oscillations, rather than by large-scale convective\nmotions.\nThis raises the question of whether the velocity fields that we\nobserve in sharp-line A-type main sequence stars might also be\ndue to pulsations, but there are several reasons to doubt this. The\n\n\fJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\nfirst is that the computations of Aerts et al. (2008) do not show\nany significant line asymmetry, the most persistent feature we\nobserved in the line profiles of A stars. Furthermore, we observe\ndepressed blue line wings and other symptoms of a velocity field\nin stars significantly hotter than the hot limit of the instability region (about 8700 K or a bit cooler; e.g. Joshi et al. 2003). A third\nreason for rejecting pulsations is that the asymmetry of line profiles in tepid stars has a constant behaviour, reproducible through\nrepeated observations of all the stars in Table 2: the excess absorption is always in the short-wavelength line wing. It is difficult to see why pulsation would not lead to excess absorption\nthat would shift from one line wing to the other. Finally, one\nof the stars in which the symptoms of a non-thermal velocity\nfield are strongest, HD 209625, has been observed very carefully to search for evidence of pulsations (Carrier et al. 2007),\nbut no hint of pulsational variations was found. This is consistent with many observational studies which have concluded that\nonly marginal and evolved Am stars are found to pulsate (cf.\nthe review of Balona 2004), thus supporting theoretical results\nfrom diffusion theory (Turcotte et al. 2000). A few exceptional\nclassical Am stars, pulsating at very low amplitude, have nevertheless been identified (Kurtz 2000). In contrast, not all the normal A stars in the centre of the instability strip are found to pulsate above observational thresholds and \u03b4 Sct variables with low\nve sin i are found to have a very large spread in observed pulsation amplitudes (Breger 2000). Thus, although we cannot completely exclude pulsation from being present in the stars listed\nin Table 2 with T e \u2264 8700 K, their maximum variability level\ndue to pulsation has to be very small, making pulsation a very\nunlikely candidate for large velocity fields that cause asymmetrically broadened line profiles.\nIt is of course possible to consider other explanations of\nthe depressed line wings than atmospheric motions. The excess\nbroadening is not caused by magnetic (Zeeman) broadening, as\nthis would selectively broaden lines of large Zeeman sensitivity;\ninstead one finds simply that all the strongest lines are broadened\nmost. In particular, if the broadening were magnetic, the strong\n4634.07 \u00c5 line of Cr ii would be considerably narrower than the\nnearby 4629.34 \u00c5 line of Fe ii; this is not observed. Similarly,\nwe can exclude the possibility that the effect is caused by hyperfine splitting, because the principle isotopes of Fe, Cr, and Ti,\nin which strong line distortion is observed, are overwhelmingly\neven-even isotopes with no net nuclear magnetic moment, and\nalso because the observed effect depends strongly on stellar T e .\nWe can exclude the possibility that the selective broadening and\ndistortion is caused by rapid rotation seen pole on, as this would\nbroaden both strong and weak lines by a similar amount. We\nnote that also a direct interaction between the two members of\neach of the observed binaries in the sample is unlikely to explain\nthe asymmetric profiles due to their constant behaviour over different rotational periods and the varied nature of their binarity.\nFinally, it seems unlikely that circumstellar material (which can\nhave quite large velocities) plays any role, as there is no observed\nemission at H\u03b1 and H\u03b2, such as one finds in Herbig AeBe stars.\nWe conclude that the atmospheric convective velocity field\nis still the most probable explanation of the line profile peculiarities reported here.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe results described in the preceding sections lead to a number\nof conclusions.\nLocal atmospheric velocity fields are confidently detected\nin main sequence stars having T e below 10000 K, but not in\n\n11\n\nstars with higher effective temperatures. These velocity fields\nare always detected via clearly non-zero values of the microturbulence parameter \u03be, which is indistinguishable from zero for\nT e \u2265 10000 K, but rises quickly to a value near 2 km s\u22121 for lower\nT e . A larger value of \u03be is found essentially only for Am stars with\nT e between 7500 and 9000 K.\nIn all stars with sufficiently sharp lines (ve sin i below about\n6 km s\u22121 for stars with 9 000 \u2264 T e \u2264 10 000 K, and below about\n12 or 13 km s\u22121 for stars with 7 500 \u2264 T e \u2264 9 000 K), there\nis a perfect correspondence between non-zero \u03be and other expressions of a local velocity field. Sharp-line stars with non-zero\nmicroturbulence also exhibit some or all of (1) best-fit values\nof ve sin i that increase with the equivalent width of the line, (2)\nsignificant line asymmetry, with a deeper depression of the blue\nline wing for stars with T e larger than about 7000 K, and a deeper\nred wing for cooler stars, and (3) profiles of strong lines that are\nclearly not correctly modelled by the usual LTE line formation\ntheory if one assumes that the only line broadening mechanisms\nare instrumental broadening, thermal and pressure broadening,\nheight-independent isotropic Gaussian microturbulence, and rotation with ve sin i derived from the weakest available lines.\nOur search for more stars which clearly exhibit characteristics (2) and (3) has yielded only a few new examples (HD 2421A,\nHD 27962, HD 103578A, HD 107168, HD 157486A, and probably HD 114330). However, even this small number has tripled\nthe available sample. The line profile characteristics of these\nstars are consistent with those of the very sharp-line stars already\nstudied (HD 72660, HD 108642A, and HD 209625; Landstreet\n1998), both in form and in variation with effective temperature.\nFrom the newly detected stars we learn that the modifications\nto spectral lines produced by local velocity fields are found in\nboth Am and non-Am stars of similar T e , although (consistent\nwith the larger \u03be values found in Am stars) the amplitude of line\nprofile distortions seems larger in Am than in normal A stars.\nThe effects directly observable in really sharp-line A-star spectra become stronger as T e decreases below 10 000 K, down to\nabout 7 000 K, below which the line profiles take on the already\nwell-known shape characteristic of solar-type stars.\nThere are now sufficient data available to make useful comparison with numerical simulations of convection for an interesting range of values of T e and log g, and the data for different\ntepid main sequence stars show a reassuring degree of consistency. We should emphasize that even if the effects we are studying here are observable only in the most slowly rotating stars,\nthey reveal that local line profiles are not predicted correctly by\nstandard theory, and aside from their interest in allowing us to\nprobe the atmospheric velocity fields directly, these effects need\nto be understood (for example through numerical simulations)\nso that they can be correctly incorporated into spectrum synthesis codes for determining, for example, abundances in stars\nof chemical elements for which only saturated spectral lines are\navailable.\nIt is observed (as is already well-known) that supergiants in\nthis T e range also show clear symptoms of local velocity fields.\nThese include large non-zero values of \u03be, best fit ve sin i values\nthat increase systematically with equivalent width, and profiles\nof strong lines that are poorly fit by the canonical line model.\nHowever, such stars do not appear to show the line asymmetry\nfound in main sequence A stars, and in the supergiants the line\nprofile distortions may be due to g-mode pulsations (Aerts et al.\n2008) rather than to local convective velocities.\nWe conclude by summarising some of the principal observational features that theoretical and numerical models should (and\nto some extent do) account for.\n\n\f12\n\nJ. D. Landstreet et al.: Atmospheric velocity fields in tepid main sequence stars\n\nOne major regularity, and one of the strongest pieces of evidence linking the observed line profile shapes to atmospheric\nconvection, is the variation of the strength of the effects discussed here with effective temperature. As T e rises past about\n7000 K, the line profile forms observed change from the solartype shapes to the shapes observed here, with strongly depressed\nblue line wings. As T e continues to rise, the effect becomes\nsteadily weaker until at about T e \u223c 10 000 K the line profiles\nbecome indistinguishable from those predicted by the standard\nmodel of line shape. As discussed by Landstreet (1998), this behaviour is completely consistent with the predictions of mixinglength theory. When mixing-length theory is applied to model\natmospheres appropriate to main sequence A and late B stars,\nit is found that the strength of the super-adiabatic temperature\ngradient in the atmosphere declines rapidly with increasing T e ,\nand its driving effect becomes negligible at about the correct\nvalue of T e . Because this behaviour results from a fundamental feature of A and B star atmospheres, namely the decline of\ncontinuum opacity as H becomes more fully ionised with rising\nT e , it is to be expected that it will also be found in numerical\nmodels. However, because of the high computational expense\nof modelling even a single T e value, this aspect of the velocity\nfield behaviour has not yet been studied numerically; most of the\nmodelling has been done for atmospheres with T e near 8000 K,\nwhere the effects of the super-adiabatic temperature gradient in\nthe lower line-forming region are largest.\nThe form of profiles of strong lines, with excess absorption far in the blue line wing relative to that in the red wing,\nrepresents the most severe challenge to numerical modelling at\npresent. The observations strongly suggest that the integrated\nform of strong absorption lines is produced by areas of gas rising\nwith relatively large velocity, while the descending gas is moving at a smaller velocity, which presumably (to conserve mass)\nmust cover a larger fractional area. This is the opposite of the solar case, and is still not found in numerical simulations in spite\nof serious efforts with 2D and 3D codes (e.g. Steffen et al. 2006;\nKochukhov et al. 2007).\nA further possible issue arises from the magnitude of the\n\"excess\" velocities detected, above line broadening due to thermal motions, pressure broadening, \"standard\" microturbulence,\nmacroscopic broadening by rotation, and finite spectral resolution. These may be as large as 10 \u2013 12 km s\u22121 as measured by\ncomparing the horizontal discrepancies between observed and\ncomputed line profiles. Since the speed of sound is roughly 7.5\nto 8.5 km s\u22121 through the line forming region of a main sequence\nA star, the inferred local velocity field may be significantly supersonic in places. This does not seem to be a real problem, however; Freytag (1995) and Kupka et al.(2009) both find that shocks\noccur in their simulations, indicating clearly the local presence\nof supersonic velocities.\nIt is very satisfying that line shape observations are able to\nprovide real tests and constraints that challenge efforts to model\nthe detailed behaviour of stellar convection. This confrontation\nwill certainly help to guide theory eventually to a more physically correct description of the phenomenon in stars.\nAcknowledgements.
