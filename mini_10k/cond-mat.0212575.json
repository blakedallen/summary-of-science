The ground-state phase diagram is\npresented in the plane defined by the electron-phonon coupling \u03bb and Coulomb interaction u. In\ncontrast to the standard one-band Hubbard model for cuprates, the metallic phase is found to exist\nfor finite values of both \u03bb and u in the present eg -orbital Hubbard model even at half-filling, due to\nthe Fermi-surface topology which is incompatible with the staggered orbital ordering concomitant to\nthe insulating phase. Based on the present results, a possible scenario for Colossal Magneto-Resistive\neffect is discussed in undoped manganites.\nPACS numbers: 75.30.Vn, 71.30.+h, 71.10.Fd, 71.38.-k\n\nOne of the most interesting issues in recent research\nactivities in condensed matter physics has been the elucidation of the mechanism of Colossal Magneto-Resistance\n(CMR) phenomena in manganites.1,2,3 Recently, it has\nbeen widely recognized that the CMR effect appears\nwhen the ground-state of manganites can be converted\nfrom insulating to ferromagnetic (FM) metallic by a small\nmagnetic field. The stability of the FM metallic phase\nin manganites is understood due to the double-exchange\n(DE) mechanism, based on the strong Hund's rule coupling between mobile eg electrons and localized t2g spins.\nOn the other hand, the insulating phase in manganites\noccurs due to the coupling between degenerate eg electrons and Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of MnO6 octahedra, leading to various types of charge and/or orbital\nordering, as observed experimentally.2\nIn undoped RMnO3 (R=rare earth lanthanide ions),\nthe parent compound of CMR manganites for most Rions, the A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating\nphase appears with the C-type ordering of the (3x2 \u2212r2 )and (3y 2 \u2212r2 )-orbitals.4 Quite recently, for R=Ho, a novel\nAFM phase called the \"E-type\" spin structure phase has\nbeen reported as the ground-state,5,6 but this state is also\ninsulating with the same orbital ordering as that of the\nA-AFM phase.7 In general, the metallic phase in manganites has been widely considered to appear only after\nholes are doped into such insulating undoped materials.\nNamely, by substituting La by alkaline earth ions such\nas Sr and Ca, holes are doped into the eg -electron band\nand, due to the DE mechanism, the FM metallic phase\nis generated. Most of the discussion in manganites has\nbeen concentrated on the phases induced by hole doping\ninto the A- or E-AFM state with different values in the\nbandwidth of carriers. In this framework, it is implicitly\nassumed that the undoped system is always insulating.\nHowever, in the theoretical phase diagram for undoped\nmanganites, which has been obtained by the numerical\nanalysis of the DE model coupled with the JT distortions, a FM metallic phase has been observed for weak\nelectron-lattice coupling region.4,7,8 This phase did not\nreceive much attention since the focus of previous pa-\n\npers was on the insulating phases. In fact, while it is\nan interesting possibility to have a metallic phase for\nRMnO3 , its existence has not yet been confirmed even\nfrom the theoretical viewpoint, since the previous calculations were carried out in small-size clusters and in addition the Coulomb interaction was not included explicitly.\nIf the FM metallic phase is confirmed to exist adjacent to\nthe A- or E-AFM insulating state in the undoped limit,\nthe CMR effect could in principle occur even without hole\ndoping. Here, recall that at the heart of the CMR phenomena is the two-phase competition between FM metallic and insulating phases.2,3 The insulating phase in undoped manganites has been widely recognized both from\nexperimental and theoretical investigations, while the existence of the FM metallic phase has not been explored,\nin spite of its potential importance.\nIn this paper, it is attempted to show the existence of\nthe FM metallic phase in undoped manganites. For this\npurpose, the spinless eg -orbital Hubbard model tightly\ncoupled to JT distortions is analyzed by using numerical\ntechniques such as relaxation method for distortions and\nLanczos algorithm for exact diagonalization. For small\nelectron-phonon coupling or Coulomb interaction, an orbital disordered phase specified with metallic characteristics is observed in two and three dimensions, while in\none dimension, the orbital-ordered insulating phase is obtained except for the non-interacting case. In the phase\ndiagram depicted in the plane spanned by the electronphonon coupling and Coulomb interaction, the metallic\nphase is found to exist in a wide range of relevant parameters. Then, it is concluded here that the metallic\nphase should exist even in undoped manganites, and its\nexperimental confirmation by suitable chemical substitutions for RMnO3 should represent a new challenge to\nexperimentalists of Mn oxides.\nModels for manganites include five important ingredients such as the kinetic term for the eg electrons, the\nHund coupling between mobile eg electrons and localized t2g spins, the electron-lattice coupling between eg\nelectrons and distortions of the MnO6 octahedra, the\nCoulomb interaction among eg electrons, and the AFM\n\n\f2\ncoupling between neighboring t2g spins.9 Fortunately, for\nthe purposes of this paper it is not necessary to consider\nall these interactions. Namely, since the FM phase is our\nfocus here, eg -electron spins can be assumed to be perfectly polarized from the outset due to the strong Hund\ncoupling between eg electrons and t2g spins. Then, in the\npresent work a spinless model including only charge and\norbital degrees of freedom can be used.\nThe Hamiltonian H studied here is, thus, given by the\ncombination of three terms: Hkin , Hel\u2212ph , and Hel\u2212el.\nThe first term indicates the hopping motion of eg electrons, written as\nX\nHkin = \u2212\nta\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 d\u2020i\u03c4 di+a\u03c4 \u2032 ,\n(1)\nia\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032\n\nwhere dia (dib ) annihilates an eg -electron in the dx2 \u2212y2\n(d3z2 \u2212r2 ) orbital at site i, a is the vector connecting\nnearest-neighbor sites, and ta\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 is the hopping ampli\u2032\ntude between \u03c4 - and\n\u221a xalongx the a-direction,\n\u221a \u03c4x -orbitals\nx\n3t\n=\n\u2212\n3tba =3tbb =3t/4 for a=x,\nexpressed\nas\nt\n=\u2212\naa\nab\n\u221a\n\u221a\ntyaa = 3tyab = 3tyba =3tybb=3t/4 for a=y, and tzbb =t with\ntzaa =tzab =tzba =0 for a=z, respectively.\nThe second term Hel\u2212ph indicates the coupling of eg\nelectrons with distortions of MnO6 octahedra, given by\nX\nHel\u2212ph = \u03bb\n(Q1i ni + Q2i \u03c4xi + Q3i \u03c4zi )\ni\n\n+ (1/2)\n\nX\n(\u03b2Q21i + Q22i + Q23i ),\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bb is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling\nconstant, Q1i is the breathing-mode distortion, and Q2i\nand Q3i are, respectively, the (x2 \u2212y 2 )- and (3z 2 \u2212r2 )type JT-mode distortions, ni = d\u2020ia dia + d\u2020ib dib , \u03c4xi =\nd\u2020ia dib + d\u2020ib dia , and \u03c4zi = d\u2020ia dia \u2212 d\u2020ib dib . The second\nterm in Hel\u2212ph is the usual quadratic potential for distortions and \u03b2 is the ratio between the spring constants\nfor breathing and JT distortion mode distortions. In this\npaper, the distortions are treated adiabatically.10\nThe third term Hel\u2212el includes the Coulomb interactions, and it is given by\nX\nHel\u2212el = u\nnia nib ,\n(3)\ni\n\nwhere ni\u03c4 =d\u2020i\u03c4 di\u03c4 and u is the on-site Coulomb interaction. Note that u=U \u2032 \u2212J, where U \u2032 in the inter-orbital\nCoulomb interaction and J is the Hund's rule coupling in\nthe standard notation for the multi-orbital model. In order to investigate the possibility of metal-insulator transition in H, the model can be analyzed from many perspectives, due to the combination of these three terms.\nLet us start our discussion considering the JT model,\ndefined as HJT =Hkin +Hel\u2212ph, obtained by dropping\nHel\u2212el . Since in this paper undoped manganites with\none eg electron per site are analyzed, it is clear that the\noxygen ions that are shared by adjacent MnO6 octahedra are all active, and the concomitant distortions are\n\nnot independent from site to site. As a consequence, the\ncooperative effect is crucially important in this case. To\nconsider this issue carefully, the simplest way is to optimize directly the displacement of shared oxygen ions\nby using relaxation techniques.4 In practice, considering\nsites i and i + a, the oxygen in between is only allowed\nto move along the a-axis (i.e. buckling and rotations are\nsimply neglected). Note that in one and two dimensions,\nsome of the oxygen ions are not shared by neighboring\noctahedra. In this paper, for simplicity, the positions\nof such unshared oxygen ions are assumed to be fixed,\nsince in the real materials those ions are not allowed to\nmove freely due to the effect of compensating cations.\nIn other words, the one-dimensional (1D) chain or the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) plane are not isolated, but they\nare embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) environment.\nIn Fig. 1, the main results for HJT are summarized.\nFor the 1D chain, it is emphasized that the JT distortion occurs for infinitesimal values of \u03bb, consistent with\nPeierls instability concepts. This issue can be clearly understood by the opening of the Peierls gap in the band\nstructure, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In this case, the orbital ordering with the alternation of 3x2 \u2212r2 and y 2 \u2212z 2\norbitals, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is stabilized due to the\ncooperative JT distortions.9 On the other hand, for the\n2D case the metal-insulator transition can be observed\nat a finite value of \u03bb. To observe this, it is convenient to monitor\nP pthe average value of the JT distortion\nhQi=(1/N ) i Q22i + Q23i , where N is the total number\nof sites. As shown in Fig. 1(c) using a 4\u00d74 cluster, hQi\nchanges from zero to a finite value at \u03bb\u223c1.2, a clear indication of a metal-insulator transition. In this situation,\nthe orbital-ordering pattern becomes bipartite as shown\nin Fig. 1(d), indicating that Q2i =q for the \"A\" sublattice,\nwhile Q2i =\u2212q for the \"B\" sublattice, with Q3i =0 for all\nsites. In other words, the distortion can be expressed by\nusing a single parameter q, since it occurs in a cooperative manner and all distortions are correlated with one\nanother. Thus, our task can be drastically reduced in the\nnumerical optimization of distortions, since it is enough\nto minimize the total energy as a function of q. Such\na calculation has been also performed and the result is\nexpressed as the dashed-curve in Fig. 1(c) for 4\u00d74 cluster, in very good agreement with the results for the full\noptimization within the computational error-bars.\nTo obtain the 4\u00d74 cluster result of Fig. 1(c), antiperiodic boundary conditions are imposed to satisfy the\nclosed-shell condition for the electron configuration in the\nnon-interaction case. The small lattice size and use of\nspecial boundary conditions may raise concerns about\nthe existence of the metal-insulator transition in the bulk\nlimit. To clarify lattice size effects, calculations in momentum space have been performed by imposing the\ntwisted boundary condition with the Bloch phase on the\nunit cell of 2\u00d72 or 4\u00d74 lattice. The difference in the size\nof the unit cell appears in the sharpness of the transition,\nindicating that the period of the distortion becomes large\nat and near the transition region.

(g) Orbital ordering in the 3D lattice.\n\ncles in Fig. 1(c), again we observe clear indications of\na metal-insulator transition, although the critical value\nis reduced. This fact suggests that the present metalinsulator transition is not spurious of a finite-size cluster.\nAs mentioned above, in the 2D case, the distortion has\nbeen expressed as a single parameter q. This is also true\nin the results for the momentum space calculation, as indicated by the solid curves in Fig. 1(c), again in good\nagreement with the full-optimized results.\nLet us consider the reason why the metallic phase can\n\nexist even at half-filling. To clarify this point, it is quite\nuseful to depict the Fermi-surface. As shown in Fig. 1(e),\nthe nesting vector is (\u03c0, 0) or (0, \u03c0), not (\u03c0, \u03c0). These\nnesting vectors are not compatible with the staggered\norbital ordering pattern (Fig. 1(d)) that is stabilized increasing \u03bb. This is one of the remarkable features of\nthe multiorbital eg -electron system, which is not specific to two dimensionality. In fact, in the results for\nthe 3D case, as shown in Fig. 1(f), we also observe the\nmetal-insulator transition at a finite value of \u03bb. The dotted curves are obtained by using the 2\u00d72\u00d72 unit cell\nwhere the twisted boundary condition with the Bloch\nphase is imposed, while the solid circles are results for a\n4\u00d74\u00d74 unit cell. Except for the sharpness in the transition, in both cases, a signal for a metal-insulator transition is clearly obtained. In this case, the orbital ordering pattern becomes very complicated, as shown in\nFig. 1(g). Note that this pattern repeats periodically on\nlattice larger than 2\u00d72\u00d72. In the 3D case, an intrinsic incompatibility between the Fermi surface and the orbital\nordering pattern is also found. Even without invoking\nthe numerical results discussed before, the qualitative arguments presented here related with the lack of nesting\neffects in HJT at small \u03bb strongly suggests the presence\nof a metallic phase in two and three dimensions.\nNow let us turn our attentions to the effect of\nCoulomb interactions by considering the Hubbard-like\nmodel, HC =Hkin +Hel\u2212el, namely dropping Hel\u2212ph in\nthis case. This model is analyzed by exact diagonalization to measure\nthe orbital correlation defined as\nP\nTz (q)=(1/N ) i,j eiq*(i\u2212j) h\u03c4zi \u03c4zj i. In the 1D case (not\nshown), Tz (\u03c0) becomes dominant for infinitesimal value\nof u, indicating that the metallic phase does not exist in\nthe 1D systems except for the non-interacting case, as\nis well known in the standard Hubbard model at halffilling. However, in higher dimensions the situation is\nquite different. Figure 2(a) denotes the results for a 2D\nlattice with 10 sites, showing that the (\u03c0, \u03c0) component\nbecomes dominant for larger value of u. However, as discussed above, the topology of the Fermi-surface is incompatible with the (\u03c0, \u03c0) correlation, and as a consequence\nTz (\u03c0, \u03c0) is no longer dominant in the small-u region.11\nIn the 3D case with 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube, a sudden increase of\nthe (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0) component is observed at u\u223c16, since a level\n\n\f4\n1.5\n\n(a) u=3\n\n\u03bb=0.3\n\n(b) 2D 10-site\n\n\u03bb=0.2\n\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\u03bb=0.4\n\u03bb=0.5\n\n-0.5\n0.0\n\nFM Insulator\nwith Orbital Order\n\n\u03bb\n\nE(0)-E(q) (units of t)\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bb=0.1\n\n0.5\n\nFM\nMetal\n\n\u03bb=0.6\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nq (units of g/kJT)\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\nu (units of t)\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: (a) E(0)\u2212E(q) as a function of q for u=3, where E(q)\nis the ground-state energy with lattice distortions characterized by a single parameter q. (b) Ground-state phase diagram\nin the (\u03bb, u)-plane. The boundary curve touches the \u03bb=0 axis\nat u\u22487.5.\n\ncrossing occurs in this case. The orbital ordering pattern\nshown in Fig. 1(g) does not show (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0) correlation due\nto the cooperative effect. Without the cooperative distortion, it is natural that (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0) correlation becomes\ndominant, as deduced from the large-u limit. Unfortunately, since it is difficult to enlarge the lattice size for\nthe exact diagonalization, it cannot be proven exactly\nthat the metal-insulator transition for HC occurs in the\nbulk limit. However, the results are highly suggestive\nthat the staggered component in the orbital correlation\nbecomes dominant in the eg -orbital Hubbard model only\nat large value of u. At small couplings, a metal should\nbe stabilized.\nAlthough it has been quite instructive to analyze the\neffects of the electron-phonon coupling and Coulomb interaction separately, both of them are simultaneously active in real materials. Thus, our final task here will be\nthe study of the full model H=Hkin +Hel\u2212ph+Hel\u2212el by\na combination of exact diagonalization for Coulomb interactions and optimization techniques for lattice distortions. It is a very hard task to perform the exact diagonalization at each step during the relaxation of the lattice\ndistortion, but in order to depict the ground-state phase\ndiagram, it is sufficient to analyze how the total energy\nchanges when lattice deformations occur. As mentioned\nin the above paragraph, fortunately in the 2D lattice the\ncooperative distortion can be expressed using a single\nparameter q. In Fig. 3(a), the total energy difference is\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nSee, for instance, Colossal Magnetoresistance Oxides,\nedited by Y. Tokura, Gordon & Breach, New York, 2000.\nE.

These results clearly indicate that the lattice distortion does not occur for \u03bb.0.3, while the optimized\nstate accompanies the lattice distortion for \u03bb&0.3, since\nthe energy minimum is located at a finite value of q.\nThus, in order to detect the metal-insulator transition\nunder reasonable CPU times, it is enough to monitor the\nchange of the total energy for a very small value of q. If\nit is negative, it strongly suggests the occurence of lattice\ndistortions. In actual calculations, the energy difference\nis evaluated for q=0.01. Using this procedure, the phase\ndiagram for the 2D 10-site cluster is shown in Fig. 3(b).\nThe results clearly indicate that the metallic phase exists, even in this case where both electron-phonon and\nCoulomb interactions are included. Note that the transition at \u03bb=0 appears as a cross-over behavior as indicated\nabove, but in the present calculations for non-zero \u03bb, the\nboundary curve seems to converge to the cross-over point\nat u\u22487.5, consistent with Fig. 2(a).\nFinally, the novel possibility of observing CMR effects\nin undoped manganites is here discussed. As mentioned\nin the introductory paragraph, in the theoretical phase\ndiagram for the undoped limit, the FM metallic state has\nbeen observed adjacent to the A- or E-type AFM insulating phase.7 In the present work, it has been confirmed\nthat such a metallic phase is not spuriously caused by the\nsmall-cluster calculations, and moreover the phase does\nnot disappear by adding Coulomb interactions. Thus,\nwithin the theoretical framework for CMR that it is based\non the competition between FM metallic and insulating\nphases of any nature, CMR-like phenomena could occur\neven in undoped manganites, a very unexpected and challenging theoretical prediction.\nIn summary, the metal-insulator transition for undoped manganites has been discussed based on the eg\norbital Hubbard model tightly coupled to JT distortions.\nThe existence of a novel FM metallic phase at zero hole\ndoping has been shown, leading to the intriguing possibility of CMR effects even in RMnO3 .\nThe author thanks E.

In actual manganites, \u03b2 is estimated to be about\ntwo, indicating that Q1i does not play an active role.\nThroughout this paper, \u03b2 is fixed as two or larger, without\nfurther remarks.\nThe peculiar increase in Tz (0, 0) in the small-u region may\nbe due to the special properties of the 10-site cluster, since\nit is not found in the 8-site result.\n\n\f"}
