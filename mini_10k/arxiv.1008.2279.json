We show that under a mild assumption on the richness of the generator\na Feller process in (U, B(U )) with (predictable) killing is a semimartingale.

To this end we analyze the connection between the semimartingale\ncharacteristics and the symbol of the process. For the latter concept we derive a stochastic formula.\nSome interesting but slightly technical criteria when a strong Markov process (on Rd , without killing) is a\nsemimartingale are given in [7]. We use a different approach and we prove along the way several estimates\nwhich are of interest on their own right. Our starting point is a classical result of the theory of pseudodifferential operators which is due to Courr\u00e8ge [8]. Let us emphasize that the case on Rd without killing is\nalways included in our considerations.\nFor Feller processes on Rd satisfying the so called 'growth condition' (formula (3.2) below) it is known that\nseveral path properties of the process can be derived by analyzing the symbol (cf. [26], [27]). Therefore the\npresent paper can (and should) be seen as a first step to generalize the respective results to processes with\nkilling, defined on subsets of Rd which do not have to fulfill the 'growth condition'. This is part of ongoing\nresearch and not in the scope of the present paper.\nLet us furthermore emphasize that boundary conditions are not taken into account here. Cases in which\nthe process hits the boundary are a priori excluded by our definitions. The interplay between boundary\nconditions and the symbol are definitely an interesting topic but it would lead us into a totally different\ndirection and would go beyond the scope of the present paper.\nAs there are different conventions in defining Feller processes in the literature, we fix some terminology\nand several notations in Section 2. While the theory of Feller processes defined on open subsets of Rd\n\u2217 Lehrstuhl IV, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Mathematik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany, Tel: +49-231755-5917, Fax: +49-231-755-3064, e-mail: alexander.schnurr@math.tu-dortmund.de\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFELLER PROCESSES AND GENERAL FRAMEWORK\n\n2\n\nwith killing is well developed, this is not the case for semimartingales. We establish the theory for this\nclass of processes in Appendix A. Most of the results of the appendix are straight-forward extensions of the\nclassical theory. However, for the readers convenience we decided to include this material and emphasize\nthe differences between these processes and classical semimartingales. Furthermore this appendix preserves\nus from writing: 'By the version of Proposition ... with killing'. In Section 3 we show that every Feller\nprocess in the above sense is a semimartingale with killing and even an It\u00f4 process (cf. Definition A.14).\nAfterwards we introduce the so called stochastic symbol of the process and analyze the relationship between\nthis concept, the generator of the process and the semimartingale characteristics. In order to round out the\npaper some examples and applications are enclosed in Section 5. The main results are Theorem 3.9 and\nTheorem 4.3.\nMost of the notation we are using is standard: if random variables are considered '=' means a.s. and in the\ncontext of stochastic processes it means indistinguishable. We write P for the predictable \u03c3-algebra. For\nthe stochastic integral we use the notations\nZ t\nHs dXs = (H \u2022 X)t\n(t > 0)\n0\n\ninterchangeably. For unexplained notation see [19]. For the well-known classes of stochastic processes\nM, V, S... the killed counterparts are written as M\u2020 , V \u2020 , S \u2020 ... (for details consult the appendix).\n\n2\n\nFeller Processes and General Framework\n\nIn the context of Feller processes we follow mainly [30] and [23]: let U \u2286 Rd be an open set and U\u2206 := U \u222a{\u2206}\nits one-point compactification. The jumps of a process with values in U are all contained in the open set\nU \u2212 U := {z \u2208 Rd : there are x, y \u2208 U such that z = y \u2212 x}.\nWe write B(U ), B(U\u2206), B(U \u2212 U ) for the respective Borel sets. Vectors in Rd are thought of as column\nvectors. A transposed vector is denoted by x\u2032 and the vector entries by x(1) , ..., x(d) . Furthermore Bb (U )\nare the bounded, real valued, Borel measurable functions and C0 (U ) denotes the continuous, real valued\nfunctions which are vanishing at \u2206, that is, for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a compact set K \u2286 U such that\n|u(x)| < \u03b5 for every x \u2208 U \\K. C0 (U ) is a closed subspace of the Banach space of continuous bounded\nfunctions (Cb (U ), k*k) and hence itself a Banach space. Here and for the remainder of the present article\nk*k denotes the supremum norm. Occasionally we will make use of the following conventions: \u2206 * 0 = 0,\n\u2206 + x = \u2206 and \u2206 \u2212 x = \u2206 for every x \u2208 U\u2206 . For a compact set K \u2286 U and u : U \u2192 R we write\nkukK := sup |u(x)| .\nx\u2208K\n\nAs a convention, every real valued function u on U is extended to u\ne on U\u2206 by setting u\ne(\u2206) = 0, if not\nmentioned otherwise. This allows us to identify C0 (U ) with a subspace of C(U\u2206 ) as follows\nC0 (U ) = {e\nu \u2208 C(U\u2206 ) : u\ne(\u2206) = 0}.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe compact unit ball around 0 is denoted by B. A function \u03ba : U \u2212 U \u2192 R is called cut-off function\nif it is Borel measurable, with compact support and equal to one in a neighborhood of zero. In this case\nh(y) := \u03ba(y) * y is a truncation function in the sense of [19]. For technical reasons we fix an R > 0 such that\n(2R)B \u2286 U \u2212 U and assume 1RB (y) 6 \u03ba(y) 6 1(2R)B (y).\nConsider a Markov process in the sense of Blumenthal-Getoor (cf. [3])\nX := (\u03a9, F , (Ft )t>0 , (Xt )t>0 , Px )x\u2208U\u2206\n\n\f2\n\n3\n\nFELLER PROCESSES AND GENERAL FRAMEWORK\n\nwith state space (U\u2206 , B(U\u2206)), which is time-homogeneous and normal, that is, Px (X0 = x) = 1. Let Pt\ndenote its transition function. As usual we interpret \u2206 as the cemetery and have, therefore,\nPt (\u2206, {\u2206}) = 1, Pt (\u2206, U ) = 0.\nWe associate a semigroup (Tt )t>0 of operators on Bb (U ) by setting\nZ\nTt u(x) :=\nu(y)Pt (x, dy) = Ex u(Xt )\n(t > 0, x \u2208 U ).\nU\n\nTt is for every t > 0 a contractive, positivity preserving and sub-Markovian operator on this space. If in\naddition\n(F1) Tt : C0 (U ) \u2212\u2192 C0 (U ) for every t > 0 and\n(F2) limt\u21930 kTt u \u2212 uk = 0 for every u \u2208 C0 (U )\nwe call the semigroup and the associated process X = (Xt )t>0 Feller. The stochastic basis (\u03a9, F , (Ft )t>0 , Px )x\u2208U\u2206\nis always in the background.\nAnalogously one could define a semigroup of Markovian operators on Bb (U\u2206 )\nZ\ne\nu\ne(y)Pt (x, dy) = Ex u\ne(Xt )\n(t > 0, x \u2208 U\u2206 ).\nTt u\ne(x) :=\nU\n\nBy (2.1) we have the following equivalence on C0 (U )\n\nTet (e\nu) = T]\nt (u)\n\nwhich allows us to switch between the two settings.\n\nThe generator (A, D(A)) is the closed operator given by\nAu(x) := lim\nt\u21930\n\nTt u(x) \u2212 u(x)\nt\n\n(u \u2208 D(A))\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere D(A) \u2286 C0 (U\u2206 ) is the set on which the limit (2.2) exists in strong sense, that is, uniformly in x \u2208 U .\nThe following result is taken from [23] Proposition VII.1.6.\nLemma 2.1. For every u \u2208 D(A) and every x \u2208 U\u2206 the process\n[u]\nMt\n\n= u(Xt ) \u2212 u(x) \u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nAu(Xs ) ds\n\n0\n\nis a Px -martingale.\nIn the sequel we assume that the domain of the generator is sufficiently rich, that is,\n\u221e\nCK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A).\n\n(2.3)\n\nA classical result due to P. Courr\u00e8ge (cf. [8]) shows that if (2.3) is fulfilled, \u2212A restricted to the test\n\u221e\nfunctions CK\n(U ) is a pseudo-differential operator with continuous negative definite symbol. This means A\ncan be written as\nZ\n\u2032\n\u221e\neix \u03be q(x, \u03be)\u00fb(\u03be) d\u03be\n(u \u2208 CK\n(U ))\n(2.4)\nAu(x) = \u2212\nRd\n\n\f3\n\n4\n\nFELLER SEMIMARTINGALES\n\nR\n\u2032\nwhere \u00fb = 1/(2\u03c0)d e\u2212iy \u03be u(y)dy denotes the Fourier transform and q : U \u00d7 Rd \u2212\u2192 C is locally bounded\nand for fixed x a continuous negative definite function in the sense of Schoenberg (cf. [2], Chapter II) in the\nco-variable. In particular it admits a L\u00e9vy-Khintchine representation (with a cut-off function \u03ba as above)\n1\nq(x, \u03be) = a(x) \u2212 il(x)\u2032 \u03be + \u03be \u2032 Q(x)\u03be\n2\nZ\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\neiy \u03be \u2212 1 \u2212 iy \u2032 \u03be * \u03ba(y) N (x, dy)\n\u2212\n\n(2.5)\n\nU\u2212U\n\nwhere (for every fixed x \u2208 U ) a(x) \u2208 R, l(x) \u2208 Rd , Q(x) is a positive semidefinite matrix and N (x, dy) is a\ntransition kernel with the property N (x, {0}) = 0 and such that for every u \u2208 CK (U ) the function\nZ\n|y|2 u(y) N (x, dy) is measurable and locally bounded.\n(2.6)\nx 7\u2192\nU\u2212U\n\nFurthermore N is bounded at infinity, that is, for every x \u2208 U there exists a c(x) > 0 such that\nN (x, ((U \u2212 U )\\V ) \u2212 x) 6 c(x) < \u221e for every neighborhood V of x.\n\n(2.7)\n\nLet us remark that the integral in (2.5) is actually defined on U \u2212 x. Therefore we have in addition\nN (x, (U \u2212 U )\\(U \u2212 x)) = 0.\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe restrict ourselves to the case where a(x) = 0 in (2.5). Let us remark that unlike in the case of L\u00e9vy\nprocesses this does not mean that there is no killing (cf. examples 5.2 and 5.3). The function q(x, \u03be) is called\nthe symbol of the operator \u2212A and as well the symbol of the process. More facts on these relationships\ncan be found in the monograph by N. Jacob [17] mostly on the space Rd . For some interesting results on\nthe conservativeness of the process see [25] (Section 5) and [12] (Chapter 9). It is a well known fact that\nthere exists a c\u00e0dl\u00e0g version for every Feller process defined on a stochastic basis which fulfills the usual\nhypotheses. In the following sections we assume every Feller process to have these properties.\nIn our investigations we always assume that the process exists. The question for which symbols there exists\na corresponding Feller process is a matter of ongoing research. See in this context [13], [1] and [5] and for a\nsurvey of the different construction methods [15].\n\n3\n\nFeller Semimartingales\n\n\u221e\nIn the sequel X denotes a Feller process with generator (A, D(A)) such that CK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A) and the\nd\nrestriction of A to the test functions is given by (2.4) where q : U \u00d7 R \u2192 C is the continuous negative\ndefinite symbol with L\u00e9vy triplet (l(x), Q(x), N (x, dy)) given by\nZ\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\n1 \u2032\n\u2032\nq(x, \u03be) = \u2212il(x) \u03be + \u03be Q(x)\u03be \u2212\neiy \u03be \u2212 1 \u2212 iy \u2032 \u03be * \u03ba(y) N (x, dy).\n(3.1)\n2\nU\u2212U\n\nRecall that 1RB 6 \u03ba 6 1(2R)B and (2R)B \u2286 U \u2212 U .\nDefinition 3.1. A Feller process X is called Feller process with killing if it is a process with killing (in the\nsense of Definition A.1) with respect to every Px (x \u2208 U ).\nRemark: Although the killing time and the announcing sequence do depend on the starting point x \u2208 U we\nwill write \u03b6 resp. \u03c4n instead of \u03b6 x resp. \u03c4nx whenever x is fixed. If not mentioned otherwise, (\u03c4n )n\u2208N always\ndenotes a fixed announcing sequence for \u03b6.\n\n\f3\n\n5\n\nFELLER SEMIMARTINGALES\n\nTheorem 3.2. Let X be a c\u00e0dl\u00e0g Feller process on U with killing. Let (A, D(A)) be the generator of the\n\u221e\n\u221e (U) as above. Then X is a d-dimensional semimartingale\nprocess with the property CK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A) and A|CK\nwith killing with respect to every Px (x \u2208 U ).\nProof: In this proof we follow mainly [26]. Let x \u2208 U . There exists a sequence of compact sets (Kn )n\u2208N\nand a sequence of open sets (Un )n\u2208N such that Kn \u2286 x + nB, Kn \u2191 U and\nx \u2208 K1 \u2286 U1 \u2286 K2 \u2286 U2 ...\n\u221e\nLet j \u2208 {1, .., d} and (\u03c6n )n\u2208N \u2286 CK\n(U ) such that \u03c6n (x) is equal x(j) on Kn and vanishes outside Un . Then,\nby Lemma 2.1,\nZ\nt\n\nMtn := \u03c6n (Xt ) \u2212\n\nA\u03c6n (Xs ) ds\n\n0\n\n\u221e\nis a Px -martingale for every n \u2208 N. Since \u03c6n \u2208 CK\n(U ), we have A\u03c6n \u2208 C0 (U ) which implies that A\u03c6n\nis bounded. It follows that the integral term is of finite variation on compacts. Thus, \u03c6n (X) is a classical\n(j)\nsemimartingale for every n \u2208 N. We have \u03c6n (Xt ) = Xt as long as Xt is in Kn , that is, on the interval\nx\n[0, \u03c1n [, where \u03c1n := \u03c3n \u2227 \u03c4n and \u03c3n := \u03c3n := inf{t > 0 : Xt \u2208 U\u2206 \\Kn }. Theorem A.7 tells us that X (j) is a\nsemimartingale with killing for j \u2208 {1, ..., d} and hence X is a d-dimensional semimartingale with killing. \u0003\n\nNow we want to further investigate the semimartingale nature of a Feller process.\nIn earlier papers on this topic (cf. [26], [25]) the following growth condition is often needed\n2\n\nsup |q(x, \u03be)| 6 c * (1 + |\u03be| )\n\n(\u03be \u2208 Rd ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nx\u2208U\n\nWe show in the following lemma that a local version of this estimate always holds for the symbols we are\ndealing with.\n\u221e\nLemma 3.3. Let (A,D(A)) be the generator of a Feller process X such that CK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A) and q(x, \u03be) be\nits symbol. In this case the following two (equivalent) conditions are always met:\n\n1. For every compact set K \u2286 U there is a cK > 0 such that\nsup |q(x, \u03be)| 6 cK * (1 + |\u03be|2 )\n\n(\u03be \u2208 Rd ).\n\n(3.3)\n\nx\u2208K\n\n2. For every compact\nset K \u2286 U and \u03b5 > 0 the three quantities klkK , kQkK and kN b\u03b5 kK are finite where\nR\nN b\u03b5 (x) = U\u2212U b\u03b5 (y) N (x, dy) and\n2\n\nb\u03b5 (y) := |y| 1\u03b5B (y) + 1\u03b5Bc (y).\n\n(3.4)\n\nProof:pBy Lemma 3.6.21\nof [17], the square root of a continuous negative definite function is sub-additive.\np\nThus, |q(x, \u03be)| 6 k |q(x, \u03be/k)|, and hence, for every k \u2208 N and x \u2208 U\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03be\n2\n.\n|q(x, \u03be)| = k q x,\nk\nFor a given \u03be we take k0 to be the integer in [|\u03be| , |\u03be| + 1[. Then,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03be\n2\n2\n|q(x, \u03be)| 6 (1 + |\u03be|) * q x,\n6 2(1 + |\u03be| ) * sup |q(x, \u03b7)| .\nk0\n|\u03b7|61\n\n\f3\n\n6\n\nFELLER SEMIMARTINGALES\n\nLet K \u2286 Rd be a compact set. We obtain\nsup |q(x, \u03be)| 6\n\n2 sup sup |q(x, \u03b7)|\n\nx\u2208K\n\nx\u2208K |\u03b7|61\n\n!\n\n2\n\n2\n\n* (1 + |\u03be| ) 6 cK * (1 + |\u03be| )\n\nsince the symbol q(x, \u03be) is locally bounded (cf. Section 2).\nNext we observe that the local growth condition (3.3) is equivalent to the local boundedness of the constitutes\nof the L\u00e9vy triplet l, Q and N (*, dy). The proof works analogously to [26] Lemma 2.1. In the end one has\nto use the fact that for every compact set K \u2286 Rd and \u03b5 > 0\n|y|\n\n2\n\n1 + |y|\n\n2\n\n\u224d b\u03b5 (y)\n\nfor y \u2192 0 and |y| \u2192 \u221e (if U is unbounded). Here f \u224d g means that there exists positive constants c1 and\nc2 such that\nc1 |g(y)| 6 |f (y)| 6 c2 |g(y)|\nfor |y| small (resp. large) enough. Thus the result.\n\n\u0003\n2\n\n2\n\nRemarks: (a) In the context of the L\u00e9vy-Khintchine formula the particular truncation function |y| /(1+|y| )\n(cf. [24] Remark 8.4) is often used (see [14]). But let us mention that this is not a cut-off function as we have\nintroduced it in Section 2. It turns out that in order to establish a neat representation of the characteristics\nof a Feller process one should use the same cut-off function for both: the L\u00e9vy-Khintchine representation of\nthe symbol and the semimartingale characteristics.\n(b) The second statement of Lemma 3.3 implies a locally uniform version of (2.7).\nStudying the domain D(A) of the generator A it is useful to rewrite it in the so called integro-differentialrepresentation. First we need the following estimate:\nLemma 3.4. For a cut-off function \u03ba = \u03baR as described in Section 2, y \u2208 U and \u03be \u2208 Rd we have\n2\n\n\u2032\n\neiy \u03be \u2212 1 \u2212 iy \u2032 \u03be\u03ba(y) 6 2(R + 1)(1 + |\u03be| )bR\u22271 (y).\n\n(3.5)\n\nProof: Recall that 1RB 6 \u03ba 6 1(2R)B . Consider |exp(iy \u2032 \u03be) \u2212 1 \u2212 iy\u03be\u03ba(y)|. For |y| 6 R \u2227 1, it is dominated\nby (1/2)(y \u2032 \u03be)2 6 (1/2) |\u03be|2 |y|2 . For R \u2227 1 6 |y| 6 2R, it is dominated by 2 + |\u03be| |y| 6 2 + (1 + |\u03be|2 ) * 2R, and\nfor |y| > 2R by 2. Combining these yields the claim.\n\u0003\nWe define the following operator on Cb2 (U ):\nd\n\u0011\n1 X \u0010 jk\nQ (x)\u2202j \u2202k u(x)\n2\nj,k=1\n\u0010\n\u0011\nu(x + y) \u2212 u(x) \u2212 y \u2032 \u2207u(x) * \u03ba(y) N (x, dy).\n\nIq u(x) := l(x)\u2032 \u2207u(x) +\n+\n\nZ\n\nU\u2212U\n\n\u221e\nCK\n(U )\n\n(3.6)\n\nFor u in\nit follows from (2.4) and (3.1) after a change in the order of integration made possible by\n(2.6), (2.7) and the estimate (3.5) that\n\u221e (U) = Iq |C \u221e (U)\nA|CK\nK\nwhere l, Q and N b\u03b5 in (3.6) are locally bounded.\nIn order to get control over the last term of Iq the following estimate is useful.\n\n\f3\n\n7\n\nFELLER SEMIMARTINGALES\n\nLemma 3.5. Let K \u2286 U be a compact set, u \u2208 Cb2 (U ) and \u03ba = \u03baR the cut-off function from above. For\n\u03b5 \u2208]0, 1[ such that K + \u03b5B \u2286 U , x \u2208 K and y \u2208 U we have\nu(x + y) \u2212 u(x) \u2212 y \u2032 \u2207u(x) * \u03ba(y)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\nX\nk\u2202 \u03b1 ukK+\u03b5B \uf8f8 .\nk\u2202 \u03b1 ukK +\n6 (2R)b\u03b5 (y) \uf8edkuk +\n|\u03b1|=2\n\n|\u03b1|=1\n\nIn particular it follows\n\n(3.7)\n\nu(x + y) \u2212 u(x) \u2212 y \u2032 \u2207u(x) * \u03ba(y) 6 (2R)b\u03b5 (y)\n\nX\n\nk\u2202 \u03b1 uk .\n\n(3.8)\n\n|\u03b1|62\n\nProof: Fix x \u2208 K and y \u2208 Rd . For y \u2208 \u03b5B the left-hand side of (3.7) is bounded by\nd\nd\n1 X\n1 2 X\nk\u2202j \u2202k ukK+\u03b5B\nk\u2202j \u2202k ukK+\u03b5B y (j) y (k) \u03ba(y) 6 |y|\n2\n2\nj,k=1\n\nj,k=1\n\nwhere we used a Taylor expansion. For y outside \u03b5B the same left-hand side is bounded by\n2 kuk + |y| * |\u2207u(x)| * \u03ba(y) 6 2 kuk + 2R |\u2207u(x)|\nsince \u03ba vanishes outside 2RB. Combining these two estimates we obtain the right-hand side of (3.7). Equation\n(3.8) follows directly from (3.7).\n\u0003\nNow we prove a local version of the inequality (2.9) of [26]. Since we have not demanded that the test\n\u221e (U) to a Feller\nfunctions are a core of A (cf. [9] Section 1.3), there might be different extensions of A|CK\ngenerator, that is, the generator of a Feller process. The results of this section are true for every such\nextension.\nLemma 3.6. Let Iq be the operator defined in (3.6). Then for every compact set K \u2286 U there is a constant\ndK > 0 such that for u \u2208 Cb2 (U )\nX\nk\u2202 \u03b1 ukK+\u03b5B\n(3.9)\nkIq ukK 6 dK * kuk +\n|\u03b1|\u2208{1,2}\n\nwhere |\u03b1| = \u03b1(1) + ... + \u03b1(d) . In particular we have\n\uf8eb\nkIq ukK 6 dK * \uf8ed\n\nX\n\n|\u03b1|62\n\n\uf8f6\n\nk\u2202 \u03b1 uk\uf8f8 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nProof: Let K \u2286 U be a compact set. We may assume that l = 0 and Q = 0 as for these 'coefficients' the\ninequality is clear. Uniformly for x \u2208 K we obtain using (3.7)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\nk\u2202 \u03b1 ukK+\u03b5B \uf8f8 .\n|Iq u(x)| 6 2R * N b\u03b5 (x) \uf8edkuk +\n|\u03b1|\u2208{1,2}\n\nwhere N b\u03b5 is locally bounded by Lemma 3.3. This completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe next observation helps us to prove that the domain of the Feller generator is quite rich: the generator\nA maps the test functions (which in our investigations are always in D(A)) into C0 (U ). This means in\n\u221e\nparticular that for u \u2208 CK\n(U ) we have\nlim Au(x) = 0.\nx\u2192\u2206\n\n\f3\n\n8\n\nFELLER SEMIMARTINGALES\n\nFor x outside of supp(u) this reads\nZ\n\nu(x + y) N (x, dy) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0.\nx\u2192\u2206\n\nU\u2212U\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u221e\nTheorem 3.7. Let (A,D(A)) be the generator of a Feller process X such that CK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A) Then we\nhave\n2\nCK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A).\n2\nProof: The operator A is closed. Let u \u2208 CK\n(U ). Using Friedrichs mollifier we know\nP that there is a compact\n\u221e\nset K \u2286 U and a sequence (un )n\u2208N \u2286 CK\n(U ) which converges to u in the norm |\u03b1|62 k\u2202 \u03b1 *k and has the\nadditional property supp(un ) \u2286 K for every n \u2208 N.\n\nIf we can show that the sequence (Aun )n\u2208N is a Cauchy sequence in (C0 (U ), k*k) the assertion will follow\nbecause of the closedness of the operator. Let \u03b5 > 0. For x outside of K we have\nZ\n(um \u2212 un )(x + y) N (x, dy).\nA(um \u2212 un )(x) =\nU\u2212U\n\nSince the convergence of (un )n\u2208N is uniform, the sequence (un )n\u2208N is uniformly bounded (and the support\n\u221e\nof every un is in K). Therefore, we can find a non-negative function f \u2208 CK\n(U ) such that \u2212f 6 un 6 f for\nevery n \u2208 N. This implies, via (3.11), that\nZ\n\n(um \u2212 un )(x + y) N (x, dy) 6 2\n\nZ\n\nf (x + y) N (x, dy)\n\nU\u2212U\n\nU\u2212U\n\nand the right-hand side vanishes as x \u2192 \u2206. Thus A(um \u2212 un ) tends to 0 uniformly in n, m, that is, there\nexists a compact set K\u0303 \u2287 K such that for x outside K\u0303 we obtain\nZ\n(um \u2212 un )(x + y) N (x, dy) < \u03b5.\n(3.12)\nA(um \u2212 un )(x) =\nU\u2212U\n\n\u221e (U) = Iq |C \u221e (U) :\nFor x \u2208 K\u0303 we use formula (3.10), recalling that A|CK\nK\n\nkA(um \u2212 un )kK\u0303 6 dK\u0303 *\n\nX\n\nk\u2202 \u03b1 (um \u2212 un )k .\n\n|\u03b1|62\n\nSince (un )n\u2208N converges in the norm\n\nP\n\n|\u03b1|62\n\nk\u2202 \u03b1 *k we can find an N \u2208 N such that for every n, m > N\n\nkA(um \u2212 un )kK\u0303 < \u03b5.\n\nTogether with formula (3.12) this yields the asserted Cauchy property.\n\u221e\nCK\n(U )\n\n\u0003\n\nSince on\nthe operators are the same and the image-sequence (Aun )n\u2208N in the proof above converges\nuniformly in C0 (U ) we obtain the following.\nCorollary 3.8.

Furthermore, \u2202j um (Xs\u2212 ) coincides with \u2202j u(Xs\u2212 ) for m > n + 1.\nUsing the dominated convergence theorem on the space F \u00d7 [0, t] we obtain\nZ Z t\n\u2202j um (Xs\u2212 )l(j) (Xs\u2212 )1[0,\u03c1n ] (s) ds dPx\nF 0\nZ Z t\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2202j u(Xs\u2212 )l(j) (Xs\u2212 )1[0,\u03c1n ] (s) ds dPx .\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nF\n\n0\n\nThe fourth term works like the third one. The only difference is that now second derivatives are used.\nThe integrand in term five\num (Xs\u2212 (\u03c9) + y) \u2212 um (Xs\u2212 (\u03c9)) \u2212 \u03ba(y)y \u2032 \u2207um (Xs\u2212 (\u03c9)) * 1[0,\u03c1n (\u03c9)] (s)\ncoincides for m > n + 1 with\nu(Xs\u2212 (\u03c9) + y) \u2212 u(Xs\u2212 (\u03c9)) \u2212 \u03ba(y)y \u2032 \u2207u(Xs\u2212 (\u03c9)) * 1[0,\u03c1n ](\u03c9) (s)\n\nThe integrability is this time given by (2.6) and by (3.7) where K = Kn and \u03b5 is chosen such that K + \u03b5B \u2286\nKn+1 . We have thus established (3.15) and the result follows.\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\n4\n\nTHE SYMBOL OF A FELLER SEMIMARTINGALE\n\n11\n\nThe Symbol of a Feller Semimartingale\n\nA stochastic formula for the symbol was first analyzed by N. Jacob in [16]. R. L. Schilling has proved a more\ngeneral result in the context of Feller processes ([25]). Only the growth condition (3.2) is needed there. In\nthe recent paper [27] we have shown that even the growth condition is not necessary. Here we generalize the\nresults to the present setting of a Feller semimartingale with killing.\nWe write for \u03be \u2208 Rd\ne\u03be (x) :=\n\n(\n\n\u2032\n\neix \u03be\n0\n\nif x \u2208 U\nif x = \u2206.\n\nDefinition 4.1. Let X be a U -valued Markov process with killing which is normal. Fix a starting point x\nand let K \u2286 U be a compact neighborhood of x. Define \u03c3 to be the first exit time of X from K:\n\b\nx\n:= inf t > 0 : Xt \u2208 U\u2206 \\K .\n(4.1)\n\u03c3 := \u03c3K\n\nThe function p : U \u00d7 Rd \u2192 C given by\n\u0011\n\u0010\nR\nEx e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) \u2212 1\ne (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) dPx \u2212 1\n{Xt\u03c3 6=\u2206} \u03be\n= \u2212 lim\np(x, \u03be) := \u2212 lim\nt\u21930\nt\u21930\nt\nt\n\n(4.2)\n\nis called the (probabilistic) symbol of the process, if the limit exists for every x \u2208 U , \u03be \u2208 Rd independently of\nthe choice of K.\nRemarks: (a) For fixed x the function p(x, \u03be) is negative definite as a function of \u03be. This can be shown as\nfollows: for every t > 0 the function \u03be 7\u2192 Ex e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) is the characteristic function of the sub-probability\nmeasure \u03bc(Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x \u2208 dy) where \u03bc := Px |{Xt\u03c3 6=\u2206} . Therefore it is a continuous positive definite function. By\nCorollary 7.7 of [2] we conclude that \u03be 7\u2192 \u2212Ex (e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03a9)) is a continuous negative definite function.\nSince the negative definite functions are a cone which contains the positive constants and which is closed\nunder pointwise limits (cf. [17] Lemma 3.6.7), the assertion is proved. Note, however, that \u03be 7\u2192 p(x, \u03be) is\nnot necessarily continuous.\n(b) In [28] the following is shown for the class of It\u00f4 processes on Rd without killing: fix x \u2208 Rd ; if the limit\n(4.2) exists for one compact neighborhood of x, then it exists for every compact neighborhood of x and the\nrespective limits coincide.\nIf X is a Feller process satisfying (2.3) the symbol p(x, \u03be) is exactly the negative definite symbol q(x, \u03be) which\nappears in the pseudo-differential representation of its generator (2.4). A posteriori this justifies the name.\nIn order to obtain this we need the following result which is an immediate consequence of Lemma 2.1.\nLemma 4.2. Let X be a Feller process with generator A. Let \u03c3 be a stopping time. Then we have\nZ \u03c3\u2227t\nEx\nAu(Xs ) ds = Ex u(X\u03c3\u2227t ) \u2212 u(x)\n\n(4.3)\n\n0\n\nfor all t > 0 and u \u2208 D(A) \u2286 C0 (U\u2206 ).\nOur second main result gives a formula to directly calculate the symbol, without even writing down the\nsemigroup or the generator:\n\u221e\nTheorem 4.3. Let (A, D(A)) be the generator of a Feller process X such that CK\n(U ) \u2286 D(A) and with\nd\nsymbol q : U \u00d7 R \u2192 C given by (3.1). Let \u03c3 be as defined in (4.1). If x 7\u2192 q(x, \u03be) is finely continuous (see\n[3] Section II.4) for each \u03be \u2208 Rd , then the probabilistic symbol p exists and coincides with the symbol q of\nthe generator.\n\n\f4\n\n12\n\nTHE SYMBOL OF A FELLER SEMIMARTINGALE\n\nRemarks: (a) Combining the result above with Theorem 3.9 provides a nice approach to directly calculate\nthe semimartingale characteristics of a Feller process.\n(b) Having calculated the symbol, one can write down the generator of the process using formula (2.4).\n(c) Let us emphasize that fine continuity is a weaker condition than ordinary continuity. Even the assumption\nthat x 7\u2192 q(x, \u03be) is continuous would not be a severe restriction. All non-pathological known examples of\nFeller processes satisfy this condition.\nProof: Fix x \u2208 U and \u03be \u2208 Rd . Let K1 := K and (Un )n\u2208N and (Kn )n\u2208N be sequences of sets such that\nKn \u2191 U and\nx \u2208 K1 \u2286 U1 \u2286 K2 \u2286 U2 ...\n\u221e\nwhere the Kn are compact and the Un are open sets for every n \u2208 N. Furthermore let (\u03ban )n\u2208N \u2286 CK\n(U ) be\na sequence of (smooth) cut-off functions such that\n\n\u03ban = 1 on Kn , \u03ban = 0 on Unc and \u03ban \u2191 1U\nThe sequence (un )n>0 defined by un := e\u03be * \u03ban is uniformly bounded in n. By definition we have un = e\u03be ,\n2\n\u2202j un = \u2202j e\u03be and \u2202j \u2202k un = \u2202j \u2202k e\u03be for j, k = 1, ..., d on K2 for n > 3. Furthermore, we have un \u2208 CK\n(U ) \u2286\nD(A).\nBy the bounded convergence theorem and Dynkin's formula (4.3) we see\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nEx e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) \u2212 1 = lim Ex un (Xt\u03c3 )e\u2212\u03be (x) \u2212 1\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n= lim Ex \u03ban (Xt\u03c3 )e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 )e\u2212\u03be (x) \u2212 1\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n= e\u2212\u03be (x) lim Ex \u03ban (Xt\u03c3 )e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 ) \u2212 \u03ban (x)e\u03be (x)\nn\u2192\u221e\nZ \u03c3\u2227t\nx\n= e\u2212\u03be (x) lim E\nA(\u03ban e\u03be )(Xs ) ds\nn\u2192\u221e\n0\nZ \u03c3\u2227t\n= e\u2212\u03be (x) lim Ex\nA(\u03ban e\u03be )(Xs\u2212 ) ds.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n0\n\nThe last equality follows since we are integrating with respect to Lebesgue measure and since a c\u00e0dl\u00e0g process\nhas a.s. a countable number of jumps. By the particular choice of the sequence (\u03ban )n\u2208N and by (3.9), where\none has to take \u03b5 < dist(K1 , U1c ), we can use again the dominated convergence theorem to pass the limit\ninside the integral and note that limn\u2192\u221e A(\u03ban e\u03be ) = e\u03be p(*, \u03be) by a classical results due to P. Courr\u00e8ge (cf.\n[8] Sections 3.3 and 3.4). Thus\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0012 Z t\n\u0013\nEx e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) \u2212 1\n1\n= \u2212e\u2212\u03be (x) lim Ex\nlim\ne\u03be (Xs\u2212 )p(Xs\u2212 , \u03be)1[0,\u03c3[ (s) ds\nt\u21930\nt\u21930\nt\nt 0\nand we may replace Xs\u2212 by Xs because we are integrating with respect to Lebesgue measure. The process\nX is bounded on [0, \u03c3[. On the same stochastic interval the mapping s 7\u2192 p(X, \u03be) is bounded and it is right\ncontinuous for every \u03be \u2208 Rd by the fine continuity of x 7\u2192 q(x, \u03be) (cf.

Since we have\nZ\n1 t\ne\u03be (Xs )p(Xs , \u03be)1[0,\u03c3[ (s) ds 6 sup e\u03be (Xs )p(Xs , \u03be)1[0,\u03c3[ (s) \u2212 e\u03be (x)q(x, \u03be)\nt 0\n06s6t\nwe obtain by the bounded convergence theorem\n\u0010\n\u0011\nEx e\u03be (Xt\u03c3 \u2212 x) \u2212 1\nlim\n= \u2212e\u2212\u03be (x)e\u03be (x)q(x, \u03be) = \u2212q(x, \u03be).\nt\u21930\nt\n\u0003\n\n\f5\n\n5\n\n13\n\nSOME EXAMPLES AND APPLICATIONS\n\nSome Examples and Applications\n\nExample 5.1. Let X be a d-dimensional L\u00e9vy process. In this case the characteristic function can be written\nin the following way:\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032\nEx ei\u03be (Xt \u2212x) = E0 ei\u03be Xt = e\u2212t*\u03c8(\u03be)\n\nwhere \u03c8 : Rd \u2192 C is a continuous negative definite function in the sense of Schoenberg. In this case we have\nfor every x \u2208 R\n\u03c8(\u03be) = p(x, \u03be) = q(x, \u03be)\nThe same result holds true for a subordinator defined on ]0, \u221e[.\nExample 5.2. It is well known that a symbol of the form\nZ\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\n1\nq(x, \u03be) = a \u2212 il\u2032 \u03be + \u03be \u2032 Q\u03be +\neiy \u03be \u2212 1 \u2212 iy \u2032 \u03be * \u03ba(y) N (dy)\n2\nU\u2212U\n\ngives rise to a L\u00e9vy process with killing, that is, plugging this symbol into formula (2.4) one obtains an\noperator which has an extension to the generator of such a process (cf. [18] Chapter 2). The killing time \u03b6\nof such a process is not predictable. Therefore, it does not fit into the setting of Section 3. However one can\nstill use formula (4.2) in order to calculate the symbol.\nExample 5.3. The superdrift (starting in x) is the deterministic Markov process given by\n(\n1\nif t \u2208 [0, 1/x[\n1\nx\nXt = x \u2212t\n\u2206\nelse\nfor x > 0. It is easy to see that this process is an It\u00f4 process with killing and even Ra Feller process. The\nt\nsymbol of this process is p(x, \u03be) = \u2212ix2 \u03be and therefore its first characteristic is Bt = 0 Xs2 ds.\nRt\nExample 5.4. Let Xt = X0 + 0 f (Xs ) ds where f (x) := sgn(x). This is an It\u00f4 process. Its transition\nsemigroup is given by setting Tt u(x) equal to u(x + t) if x > 0, to u(0) if x = 0, and to u(x \u2212 t) if x < 0.\nTaking t = 1, we see that Tt u(0+) = u(1) whereas Tt u(0) = u(0) (cf. [28] Example B.6). Thus, if u \u2208 C0 (R)\nis chosen such that u(1) 6= u(0), then t 7\u2192 Tt u fails to be continuous, so, X is not Feller. The semimartingale\ncharacteristics of this space dependent drift are (B, C, \u03bd) = (X \u2212 x, 0, 0) and the symbol of the process is\np(x, \u03be) = \u2212i * sgn(x)\u03be.\nThis symbol is not continuous in x, but it is finely continuous, since t 7\u2212\u2192 l(Xt ) is right continuous for every\nPx (x \u2208 R).\nExample 5.5. Let (Zt )t>0 be an Rn -valued L\u00e9vy process with symbol \u03c8(\u03be) and consider the stochastic\ndifferential equation\nx\ndXtx = \u03a6(Xt\u2212\n) dZt\n\nX0x = x,\n\nx \u2208 Rd ,\n\nwhere \u03a6 : Rd \u2192 Rd\u00d7n is Lipschitz continuous and bounded. In [27] it is shown that the solution X x is a\nFeller process with symbol\np(x, \u03be) = q(x, \u03be) = \u03c8(\u03a6(x)\u2032 \u03be).\nIf \u03a6 is not bounded the process is an It\u00f4 process and the formula for the symbol remains valid.\n\n\fA APPENDIX: KILLED SEMIMARTINGALES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS\n\nA\n\n14\n\nAppendix: Killed Semimartingales and Their Characteristics\n\nIn the whole section \u03b6 : \u03a9 \u2192 [0, \u221e] denotes a predictable time (cf. [19]), the so called killing time. We write\n\u03c4n \u2191 \u03b6 (for n \u2192 \u221e a.s.) if the sequence of stopping times (\u03c4n )n\u2208N is monotone increasing and converges a.s.\nto \u03b6. If in addition \u03c4n < \u03b6 (on \u03b6 6= 0) we write \u03c4n \u2191\u2191 \u03b6 (for n \u2192 \u221e a.s.). In the latter case (\u03c4n )n\u2208N is called\nan announcing sequence for \u03b6.\nThe reader might wonder why only predictable killing is taken into account. This is owed to the fact that we\nwant to use semimartingale techniques in order to work with Feller processes. One of the most important\ntools in doing this is by using localization. And having an approximating sequence of stopping times makes\n\u03b6 automatically predictable (see e.g. [19] Theorem I.2.14). When local martingales with killing are treated\nin the literature, the same restriction is put on \u03b6 (cf. [10]).\nDefinition A.1. Let U be an open subset of Rd . Let X be a stochastic process on the stochastic basis\n(\u03a9, F , (Ft )t>0 , P) with values in (U\u2206 , B(U\u2206 )) and let \u03b6 be a predictable time. X is called a process with\nkilling at \u03b6 if X * 1[0,\u03b6[ takes only values in U and X * 1[\u03b6,\u221e[ is idenitically equal to \u2206.\nFor the remainder of the section we assume all processes to be adapted to the filtration (Ft )t>0 .\nDefinition A.2. Let V be an open subset of R. And let A, M be processes on V\u2206 with killing.\n1. A is called of finite variation if the paths s 7\u2192 Xs (\u03c9) are a.s. of finite variation on every compact\ninterval [0, t] \u2286 [0, \u03b6(\u03c9)[.\n2. If A is adapted, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g, of finite variation and A0 = 0 then we write A \u2208 V \u2020 .\n3. If A is adapted, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g, increasing and A0 = 0 then we write A \u2208 V +,\u2020 .\n4. We write Var(A) for the variation process of A, that is, the process such that Var(A)t (\u03c9) is the total\nvariation of the function s 7\u2192 As (\u03c9) on the interval [0, t] \u2286 [0, \u03b6(\u03c9)[ and Var(A) = \u2206 on [\u03b6, \u221e[.\n5. M is called a local martingale if there exists an announcing sequence \u03c4n \u2191\u2191 \u03b6 such that M \u03c4n is a c\u00e0dl\u00e0g\nlocal martingale (in the classical sense). We write M \u2208 M\u2020loc .\n6. If M is adapted, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g, a local martingale and M0 = 0 then we write M \u2208 L\u2020\nRemarks: (a) L\u2020 , V \u2020 are vector spaces.\n(b) L\u2020 , V \u2020 , V +,\u2020 are stable under stopping (cf. [19] Lemma I.1.35). If e.g. M \u2208 L\u2020 and \u03c4 is a stopping time\nthen M \u03c4 is again in L\u2020 but with the new killing time \u03b6e = \u03b6 * 1{\u03c4 >\u03b6} + \u221e * 1{\u03c4 <\u03b6} . The stopping time \u03b6e is\nagain a predictable time by Propositions I.2.10 and I.2.11 of [19].\n+,\u2020\nDefinition A.3.\n1.

We write A \u2208 A\u2020loc if A \u2208 V \u2020 and there exists an announcing sequence \u03c4n \u2191\u2191 \u03b6 such that E(Var(A))\u03c4n 6\n\u221e for every n \u2208 N.\nLemma A.4.

In particular A \u2208 A\u2020loc .\nProof: Let B := Var(A). Obviously this process is predictable.

We write X \u2208 S \u2020 for this class.\n2. Let U be an open subset of Rd . A process X in U\u2206 with killing is called a (d-dimensional) semimartingale with killing, if each of its components is a semimartingale with killing.

A (one-dimensional) semimartingale X with killing is called a special semimartingale with\nkilling if it admits a decomposition\nXt = X0 + At + Mt\n\n(t > 0)\n\n(A.1)\n\nsuch that M \u2208 L\u2020 and A is a predictable process in V \u2020 . We write Sp\u2020 for this class of processes.\nProposition A.9. Let X \u2208 S \u2020 . The following are equivalent:\n(i) X \u2208 Sp\u2020 ,\n(ii) There is a decomposition X = X0 + A + M as in (A.1) with A \u2208 A\u2020loc .\n(iii) For every decomposition X = X0 + A + M as in (A.1) we have A \u2208 A\u2020loc .\n(iv) We have Yt = sups6t |Xs \u2212 X0 | \u2208 A+,\u2020\nloc .\nProof: Cf. [19] Proposition I.4.23\n\n\u0003.\n\nLemma A.10. If X \u2208 S \u2020 and there exists an a > 0 such that |\u2206X| 6 a on [0, \u03b6[ then X is a special\nsemimartingale with killing.\nRemark: Here and in the sequel we use the common notation \u2206X := X \u2212 X\u2212 . It should be clear from the\ncontext if the cemetery state or the jumps of the process are meant.\nProof: Let \u03c3n := inf{t > 0 : Xt = \u2206 or |Xt \u2212 X0 | > n} and \u03c1n := \u03c3n \u2227 \u03c4n . Then the sequence of stopping\ntimes (\u03c1n )n\u2208N converges to \u03b6 and\nsup |Xs \u2212 X0 | 6 n + a\ns6\u03c1n\n\nThus (iv) of Proposition A.9 is met.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark: This shows that if U is bounded we have S \u2020 = Sp\u2020 .\nThe stochastic integral with killing is defined as follows: let X be a semimartingale with killing at \u03b6 X and H\nbe a predictable process with killing at \u03b6 H . We write \u03b6 := \u03b6 H \u2227 \u03b6 X and denote by (\u03c4n )n\u2208N the announcing\nsequence of \u03b6 given by \u03c4n := \u03c4nH \u2227 \u03c4nX . We set for every n \u2208 N on [0, \u03b6[\n(H \u2022 X)\u03c4n := H \u2022 X \u03c4n\nand (H \u2022 X) := \u2206 on [\u03b6, \u221e[.\nThe process H \u2022 X is well defined since for m > n\n(H \u2022 X \u03c4m )\u03c4n = (H1[0,\u03c4n ] ) \u2022 X \u03c4m\n= H \u2022 (1[0,\u03c4n ] \u2022 X \u03c4m )\n= H \u2022 X \u03c4n .\nBy a similar argument it is easy to see that this definition does not depend on the choice of the announcing\nsequence (\u03c4n )n\u2208N . See in this context [21] (Section 5) where only the case of continuous semimartingales is\ntreated.\nIn the Section 3 we need It\u00f4's formula for processes with killing. In order to obtain this we use the classical\nIt\u00f4's formula on the stopped processes X \u03c4n .\n\n\fA APPENDIX: KILLED SEMIMARTINGALES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS\n\n17\n\nTheorem A.11. Let R \u222a {\u03b3} be the one-point compactification of R.

Hence by Lemma A.10 X(\u03ba)(j) \u2208 Sp\u2020 for j = 1, ..., d.\nTherefore there exists a unique decomposition\n(j)\n\nX(\u03ba)(j) = X0 + M (\u03ba)(j) + B(\u03ba)(j)\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere M (\u03ba)(j) \u2208 L\u2020 and B(\u03ba)(j) is a predictable process in V \u2020 . The first characteristic of X is defined to be\nB := B(\u03ba) = (B(\u03ba)(1) , ..., B(\u03ba)(d) )\u2032 .\nThe localized second characteristic C(n) is defined componentwise on [0, \u03c4n [ for every n \u2208 N by\nC jk (n) := X \u03c4n ,(j),c , X \u03c4n,(k),c .\nFor m > n we obtain\nm\n= [X, X]\u03c4t m \u2227\u03c4n = [X, X]\u03c4t n = [X \u03c4n , X \u03c4n ]t\n[X \u03c4m , X \u03c4m ]t\u2227\u03c4n = [X, X]\u03c4t\u2227\u03c4\nn\n\nand hence on [0, \u03c4n [\nD\n\nX \u03c4m , X \u03c4m\n\nEc\n\nEc\nic D\nic h\nh\n= X \u03c4m , X \u03c4m = X \u03c4n , X \u03c4n = X \u03c4n , X \u03c4n .\n\nTherefore we can set C := C(n) on [0, \u03c4n [ for every n \u2208 N and C jk := \u03b3 on [\u03b6, \u221e[. C is called the second\ncharacteristic of X.\nThe third characteristic \u03bd is defined analogously as in the classical case, that is, \u03bd is the compensator of the\nrandom measure of jumps \u03bcX restricted to [0, \u03b6[:\nX\n\u03bcX (\u03c9; dt, dy) :=\n1{\u2206Xs (\u03c9)6=0} \u03b5(s,\u2206Xs (\u03c9)) (dt, dy)\ns<\u03b6\n\n\f18\n\nA APPENDIX: KILLED SEMIMARTINGALES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS\n\n(cf.

Let X = (\u03a9, F , (Ft )t>0 , (Xt )t>0 , Px )x\u2208U\u2206 be a Markov process on (U, B(U )) with killing.\nWe call X It\u00f4 process with killing if X \u2208 S~\u2020 and its semimartingale characteristics (B, C, \u03bd) with respect to\nthe fixed cut-off function \u03ba can be written as\nZ t\n(j)\nBt (\u03c9) =\nl(j) (Xs (\u03c9)) dFs\n0\nZ t\n(A.12)\njk\nQjk (Xs (\u03c9)) dFs\nCt (\u03c9) =\n0\n\n\u03bd(\u03c9; ds, dy) = N (Xs (\u03c9), dy) dFs\n\nfor every Px , (x \u2208 U ) where for every z \u2208 U : l(z) \u2208 Rd , Q(z) is a positive semidefinite matrix, N (z, dy) is a\nBorel transition kernel such that N (z, {0}) = 0 and Fs = s * 1[0,\u03b6[ (s) + \u2206 * 1[\u03b6,\u221e[ (s).\nRemark: It\u00f4 processes in the above sense (on Rd without killing) were introduced in [7] as a sub-class of\nHunt semimartingales. In [6] it is shown that they can be characterized as a class of solutions of certain\nSDEs. The stochastic symbol for this class of processes was introduded in [28].\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper contains some of the results of my Ph.D thesis written under the guidance of Professor Ren\u00e9 L.\nSchilling, to whom I am deeply grateful for many helpful suggestions.
