Box 522, 11001 Belgrade, Serbia\nNovember 14, 2018\n\nAbstract\nSome new properties of symmetries that disappear as point symmetries after the first reduction of order of an ODE and reappear after\nthe second are analyzed from the aspect of three-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries of differential equations. The form of a hidden\nsymmetry is shown to consist of two parts, one of which always remains preserved as a point symmetry, and the second (fundamental)\npart which behaves as the complete hidden symmetry. Symmetry that\ndisappears as point symmetry and remains hidden (non-local) during\nn reductions of order before reappearing as a point symmetry is also\nintroduced and termed convertible symmetry of order n \u2212 1. We discuss the necessity for such classification in order to distinguish them\nfrom hidden symmetries of type I and type II, which are defined with\nrespect to reduction of order by one.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe search for Lie point symmetries represents a common method for determining the properties of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) so that the\nfound symmetries are used to reduce the order of the equation. If a differential equation of order n has an n-parameter solvable Lie group of symmetries,\nthe equation may be solved by group-theoretic quadrature method following\na proper reduction path using one-parameter subgroups. This approach may\nnot be possible due to, for example, non solvability of the n-parameter Lie\ngroup so that certain symmetries may be lost making the complete reduction\nimpossible. In that case, the lower order reduced ODE has a type I hidden\nsymmetry[2],[3],[5],[6] whose origin may be attributed to the reduction by\nthe invariants of a non-normal subgroup, i.e. a symmetry group that is lost\n\n1\n\n\fis not a normal subgroup. In the case of two point symmetries, X and Y let\n[X, Y ] = X,\nX being the normal subgroup. Reducing the order of equation using the\nnormal subgroup X leads to the descendant of Y being a point symmetry of the reduced equation. On the other hand, reduction using Y first,\ncauses X to be lost as a point symmetry of the descendant equation. Complete reduction of the starting equation of order n, in general, may also\nbe impossible if the symmetry group is not an n-parameter group, i.e. if\nit has less than n parameters. Exceptions to this case arise when during\nreduction new symmetries appear in addition to inherited ones when the\norder of the ODE is reduced by one, and they are known as type II hidden\nsymmetries[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. In this scenario a symmetry of the initial ODE\nmay not be inherited in the reduced equation (becomes nonlocal), however\nit transforms to an inherited symmetry in the subsequent reduction. As\nit turns out, in order to solve an ODE the requirement that the reduction\nof order must be by the normal subgroup is not necessary[7]. Moreover,\nthe complete reduction of the starting ODE is more likely by inclusion of\na larger variety of symmetries, and also the chances for appearance of type\nII hidden symmetries are increased, enhancing the likelihood of complete\nreduction. In the following sections we analyze the conditions necessary for\na symmetry to disappear during the first reduction and become non-local\n(type I hidden symmetry), and to reappear as a point symmetry (type II\nhidden symmetry) after the second reduction of order. We call this symmetry a convertible type symmetry of order I. In general, a convertible type of\nsymmetry of order n\u22121 may be defined as a point symmetry that disappears\nduring the first reduction, remains hidden (non-local) during n \u2212 1 reductions, and reappears as a point symmetry after n reductions. Convertible\nsymmetries may be regarded as a special class of hidden symmetries of type\nII. We show that such symmetries consist of two parts, one of which always\nremains of point type and the other of convertible (changeable) type which\nhas the power over the behavior of the complete symmetry. By knowing\nthe exact form of the hidden symmetry of type II, as shown in this paper,\none may infer whether the origin of the hidden symmetry lies in convertible\nsymmetry or non-local symmetry of unknown, higher order than the order\nof the initial ODE. The paper is organized as follows: In the first Section\nthe focus is on three generators of symmetries from the complete algebra\nof symmetries of the n-th order ODE and the general form of a convertible\nsymmetry of type I, i.e. a hidden symmetry that transforms from type I to\ntype II after two consecutive reductions of order. In sections two and three,\nwe discuss three examples that employ results of the previous Section. The\nfirst example is specially constructed in order to illuminate the results of\nSection 1, while the second example shows how performing a nonnormal reduction along with the use of hidden symmetry properties provides an easier\n2\n\n\fpath to the solution of the third order ODE. In the third example, presented\nin a separate section, we analyze a convertible symmetry of type II (a symmetry that remains hidden during two reductions of order and reappears as\na point symmetry after the third reduction) Moreover we show how important information about the integration and reduction paths may be known\nin advance by exploiting the results presented here and the properties of\nthe solvable algebra. Two appendices at the end of the paper complement\nthe main exposition. The first one contains a derivation of the practical\nrule according to which it may be inferred whether a symmetry along the\nreduction path is of point or non-local type. The second one illustrates an\nalternative derivation of the properties demonstrated in Section 1. In the\nfinal Section we give some concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\nProperties of Convertible Symmetry of Type I\n\nWe consider the general n-th order ODE\ny (n) = fn (x, y, y \u2032 , ...y (n\u22121) ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x and y are the independent and dependent variables, respectively,\nand y (n) = dy n /dxn , admitting three vector fields of the corresponding symmetries X, Y and Z. Naturally, eq. (1) may have more symmetry generators,\nhence X, Y and Z may not necessarily form an algebra. In accordance with\nthe properties of the hidden symmetries mentioned above, let\n[X, Y ] = \u03bbX,\nwhere \u03bb is a constant (either 0 or scaled to 1), be the condition for preservation of symmetry Y when the reduction is performed using symmetry X.\nIn addition, let\n[X, Z] 6= \u03bcX\nrepresent the condition for the symmetry Z to disappear when the reduction\nis performed using X (\u03bc is a constant). Then during reduction using Lie\npoint symmetry X the order of the initial ODE is reduced by one and Y is\ninherited as a point symmetry, while Z becomes non-local symmetry of the\nnew differential equation, i.e. Z is lost as a point symmetry. The canonical\nform of 2-dimensional Lie algebras[8], representing four distinct classes of\nalgebras equivalent under point transformations may be described simply in\nterms of the commutator and the pseudo-scalar product\nX \u2228 Y = \u03be1\u03b72 \u2212 \u03be2\u03b71,\nwhere\nX = \u03be 1 (x, y)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b7 1 (x, y) , and Y = \u03be 2 (x, y)\n+ \u03b7 2 (x, y) .\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n3\n\n\fThe canonical form includes four algebras, two Abelian and two solvable,\nwhose properties are given in Table 1.\nType\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\n\nL2 structure\n[X, Y ] = 0\n[X, Y ] = 0\n[X, Y ] = X\n[X, Y ] = X\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\u2228Y\n\u2228Y\n\u2228Y\n\u2228Y\n\nBasis of\n\u2202\nX = \u2202s\n\u2202\nX = \u2202s\n\u2202\nX = \u2202s\n\u2202\nX = \u2202s\n\n=0\n6= 0\n=0\n6= 0\n\nL2 in canonical variables\n\u2202\nY = r \u2202s\n\u2202\nY = \u2202r\n\u2202\nY = s \u2202s\n\u2202\n\u2202\nY = r \u2202r\n+ s \u2202s\n\nLet (r, s) be canonical coordinates for the group generated by the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter Lie group X, so that\nX=\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202s\n\nThe ODE (1) written in terms of canonical coordinates is of the form\ns(n) = \u03a9n (r, s\u2032 , ..., s(n\u22121) ),\n\ns(k) =\n\ndk s\n.\ndr k\n\nMaking a substitution v = s\u2032 we reduce the original equation to an ODE of\norder (n \u2212 1) :\nv (n\u22121) = \u03a9n\u22121 (r, v, ..., v (n\u22122) ),\n\nv (k) =\n\ndk+1 s\n.\ndr k+1\n\n(2)\n\nAssuming that the third symmetry Z may be expressed in canonical coordinates as\nZ = A(r, s)\u2202r + B(r, s)\u2202s\nwe explore all four possibilities:\n1.\n\nX = \u2202s ,\n\nY = r\u2202s ,\n\nZ = A(r, s)\u2202r + B(r, s)\u2202s\n\nThe first prolongations of vector fields Y and Z are:\nY (1) = r\u2202s + \u2202v ,\nZ (1) = A\u2202r + B\u2202s + (Br + (Bs \u2212 Ar )v \u2212 As v 2 )\u2202v .\nODE (2) has an inherited point symmetry from eq.

Therefore, the vector field Z 0 represents the unalterable (fundamental) symmetry in the sense that it is preserved\nas a point symmetry during both reductions (irrespective of the first\nsymmetry used for reduction), while Z \u2217 represents the dominant symmetry which is lost during the first reduction and reappears after the\nsecond reduction, and whose behavior determines the behavior of the\nsymmetry Z. Hence we may use expression (7) as a general form of the\ntype I hidden symmetry that turns into a type II hidden symmetry.\nIn evaluating the last commutator relation in (10) we have used the\nfact that canonical coordinates are not uniquely defined and that they\nsatisfy transformation\ns\u0304 = s + G(r)\n\n(11)\n\nr\u0304 = F (r),\nfor arbitrary smooth functions F and G, with additional constraint\n\u2032\nF (r) 6= 0.

On the other hand, the vector field Z is lost as a point symmetry\ndue to the commutator relationship [X, Z] = Y. Note that according to the\ncategorization of Section 1, the symmetry Z is of type A.

However, nonnormal reduction may prove to offer a more efficient and easier route to the solution if properties of hidden (convertible)\nsymmetries are used, as illustrated in the next example. Consider the third\norder ODE:\n3\n(17)\ny \u2032\u2032\u2032 + y \u2032\u2032 + xy \u2032\u20322 = 0.\nx\nThe equation possesses the solvable Lie algebra of symmetries\nX = \u2202y\n\nY = x\u2202y\n\nZ = x2 \u2202x + xy\u2202y ,\n\nwith commutator relations\n[X, Y ] = 0,\n\n[X, Z] = Y , [Y, Z] = 0.\n\nThe standard procedure would be to perform the order reduction using\nthe normal group Y = x\u2202y , yielding the canonical coordinates r = x and\ns = y/x.

Specifically, a type I hidden symmetry is a Lie symmetry that is\nlost when an ODE is reduced by one order, in addition to the symmetry\nused to perform the reduction[3]. Type II hidden symmetry appears in\naddition to the inherited ones, when the ODE is reduced by one order. The\norigin of hidden symmetries of type II has been attributed to reductions,\namong others, that involve solvable, nonabelian, three-parameter groups and\nwhich are associated with nonlocal symmetries[3],[4]. Non-local symmetries\nthat reduce to point symmetries under a single reduction of order have\nbeen labeled as \"first-order\" and termed \"useful\" nonlocal symmetries[10].\nHere we present an example which introduces a useful, second-order nonlocal\nsymmetry in the reduction of a fourth order ODE with a four-parameter\nsolvable Lie algebra. The term useful should be understood here in a wider\nsense, since this second-order nonlocal symmetry proves to be essential not\n11\n\n\fonly for the integration of the initial fourth order equation, but also for\nsolving the third order ODE appearing after the first reduction in case it is\nan initial equation to solve. In the reduction path, two of the symmetries are\nof convertible type. One of the symmetries reappears as a point symmetry\nafter the second reduction of order (hence it is of order I) and the other\nbecomes a point symmetry after the third and final reduction (convertible\nsymmetry of order II).\nIn the following exposition we adhere to the notation of reference[9], so\nthat An,m denotes a Lie algebra of dimension n and isomorphism type m.\nThe algebra A4,1 has a basis\nX = \u2202y ,\n\nZ = x2 \u2202y ,\n\nY = x\u2202y ,\n\nU = \u2202x ,\n\n(21)\n\nwith nonzero commutator relations\n[Y, U ] = \u2212X,\n\n[Z, U ] = \u22122Y.\n\n(22)\n\nUpon using the property of nonuniqueness of canonical coordinates (11), its\nmost general invariant equation is\n\u25b34 : y (iv) = F (y \u2032\u2032\u2032 ).\n\n(23)\n\nThe reduction path of eq. (23) that we choose for analysis is schematically\npresented in the following diagram\n\u25b3n , n\u2212equation order\n\nalgebra; nonlocal symmetries\n\n\u25b34\n\u2193U\n\u25b33\n\u2193 X\u0303 (1)\n\u25b32\n\u2193 \u1ef8 (2)\n\u25b31\n\nA4,1 (X, Y, Z, U )\nA1 (X\u0303 (1) ); \u1ef8 (1),N , Z\u0303 (1),N\nA1 (\u1ef8 (2) ); Z\u0303 (2),N\nA1 (Z\u0303 (3) )\n\nwhere superscript N denotes that the symmetry is nonlocal and tilde denotes\nrestriction of the inherited symmetry generator to corresponding fundamental differential invariants.\nDefinitions of type I and type II hidden symmetries carry certain ambiguousness in the sense that their classification depends on the equation to\nwhich they pertain to. Hence it may happen that the same symmetry may\nbe of different type along the reduction path depending on the equation to\nwhich it is related to. For example, in the above reduction path symmetry\nY is a hidden symmetry of type I for equation \u25b34 , while it is a hidden\nsymmetry of type II for equation \u25b33 . On the other hand symmetry Z is a\n12\n\n\fhidden symmetry of type I for equation \u25b34 while it is a hidden symmetry\nof type II for \u25b32 . This relative classification is avoided in making use of\nconvertible type symmetries since then for equation \u25b34 symmetry Y is convertible symmetry of order I while Z is convertible type symmetry of order\nII.\n\n4.1\n\nAnalysis of the reduction path\n\nSymmetry U is chosen to start the reduction procedure, so that based on\nthe commutator relations (22) the only inherited symmetry is X, while Y\nand Z become non-local. In order to predict what happens next with these\nsymmetries, we analyze the commutators of two sets; the first one consists of\nsymmetries U, X and Y (and it is a subalgebra) and the other of symmetries\nU, Z and X. For the first, comparison with expression (13) indicates that\n\u03b3 = 0, \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 = 0, and that Y becomes a point symmetry following the\nnext reduction using X\u0303 (1) .. On the other hand the second set does not form\na subalgebra because of the commutator [U, Z] = 2Y. Hence, Z remains a\nnon-local symmetry during the second reduction too. In order to prove that\nZ\u0303 (3) is a point symmetry we use the property, proved in the Appendix A,\nthat the commutator of Z with each of the symmetries used for reduction\nup to that point, yields the sum of already used symmetries scaled with\nappropriate coefficients. Since the commutators of Z with U, X and Y yield\n\u22122Y , 0 and 0 respectively (Y has been used in the reduction previously),\nZ\u0303 (3) is a point symmetry.\n\n4.2\n\nExploiting algebra solvability and properties of hidden\nsymmetries\n\nThe group generated by U has fundamental differential invariants r = y and\nv = s\u2032 where s = x, so that U corresponds to X, X corresponds to Y and\nY corresponds to Z of Case 2 discussed in Section 1.

Introducing new canonical coordinates \u03b8 = r and \u03c1 = v, and changing variables so\nthat v \u2032 = 1/\u03b8\u2032 and w = \u03b8\u2032 , one obtains\nw\u2032\u2032 \u2212 3\n\nw2\nw\u2032\n3\nw\u2032\nw\u20322\n\u2212 15 2 \u2212 10\n= w4 \u03c15 F ( 5 2 + 4 3 ).\nw\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1 w\n\u03c1 w\n\n(25)\n\nThe following restrictions are readily calculated\nY (2) \u03c1 = \u2212\u03c12\nZ (2) \u03c1 = \u22122x\u03c12\n\nY (2) w = \u22123\u03c1w\u2202w\nZ (2) v = 6x\u03c1w + \u03c13 w2\n\nyielding\n\u1ef8 (2) = \u03c12 \u2202\u03c1 + 3\u03c1w\u2202w ,\nZ\u0303 (2),N = \u22122\u03c12 \u2202\u03c1 + (6x\u03c1w + \u03c13 w2 )\u2202w .\nHence Y generates point transformations of variables \u03c1 and w, while Z remains hidden (non-local). Focusing attention on the subalgebra Span (U, X\nand Y ) and the form \u1ef8 (2) acquires as a point symmetry, it is immediately apparent that \u1ef8 (2) corresponds to Z (2) of Case 2 (Section 1), with c1 = c4 = 1\nas the only coefficients different from zero. Continuing further along the\nreduction path using the only point symmetry \u1ef8 (2) and introducing new\ncanonical coordinates t and u, the following relations are obtained between\nnew and old canonical coordinates:\n1\n\u03c1 = \u2212 ,\nt\nw = \u2212ut3 ,\nso that eq.

A convertible symmetry of order n \u2212 1 is defined as point symmetry\nthat disappears during the first reduction, remains hidden (non-local) during n \u2212 1 reductions, and reappears as a point symmetry after n reductions.\nIn particular, properties of convertible symmetry of type I (hidden symmetry that disappears after the first reduction of order of an n-th order ODE\nand reappears as a point symmetry after the second reduction) were analyzed. It was shown that hidden symmetry, Z, along with two symmetries,\nX and Y , used for reduction necessarily form a subalgebra, while X and Y\nnecessarily commute. The convertible symmetry consists of two parts one\nof which always remains the symmetry of point type. The other part is the\ncarrier of the main characteristics of the hidden symmetry and determines\nthe symmetry type along the reduction path. The importance of convertible symmetry of type II (the symmetry that remains non-local during two\nreductions of order and reappears as a point symmetry after the third reduction) is illustrated by the reduction procedure in solving a fourth order\nODE, supplemented with the application of a practical rule for determining\nthe symmetry type along the reduction path.\n\nReferences\n[1] Olver P.J., Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations,\nSpringer-Verlag, New York, (2nd edition), 1993.\n[2] Abraham-Shrauner B., Hidden Symmetries and Nonlocal Group Generators for Ordinary Differential equations, IMA J.

Essentially, the procedure is very\nsimilar to the stepwise integration of the n-th order ODE having an ndimensional Lie algebra, for example given in Section 5.3 of ref. [11]. Hence,\nthe starting assumption is that the ODE of order n has an n-dimensional\nsolvable Lie algebra L. Suppose that the symmetry Z\u0303 which appears after\nk reductions, performed using generators X1 , .....Xk , is of point type, i.e. its\nform is\nZ\u0303 = \u03b1(rk , vk )\u2202rk + \u03b2(rk , vk )\u2202vk .\n(27)\nHence Z is essentially equal to Xk+1 generator. Furthermore, suppose that\nthe generators X1 , .....Xk form a subalgebra of L, so that (rk , vk ) are fundamental differential invariants of this subalgebra. Symmetry Z\u0303 is therefore of\nthe form (27) if Z\u0303 acts on (rk , vk ) as a generator of point transformations,\nfor at least one of the functions \u03b1 or \u03b2 different from zero. The property of\ndifferential invariants is\nX\u0303i rk = 0,\n\nX\u0303i vk = 0,\n\nso that\n[X\u0303i , Z\u0303]rk = X\u0303i \u03b1,\n[X\u0303i , Z\u0303]rk = X\u0303i \u03b2.\n\n16\n\n\u2200i = 1, ..., k,\n\n\fThis can be written as\nk\u22121\n(aik+1\nX\u0303k\u22121 + bZ\u0303)rk = b\u03b1,\nk\u22121\n(aik+1\nX\u0303k\u22121 + bZ\u0303)vk = b\u03b2,\n\nwhere a\u2032 s and b are structure constants. From obvious relationships\nb\u03b1 = X\u0303i \u03b1 = 0\nb\u03b2 = X\u0303i \u03b2 = 0,\nfollows that\nb = 0.\nMoreover, using property[1]\n^\n[X\u0303i , Z\u0303] = [X\ni , Z],\nwe get the desired result, namely that the commutator of Z with each of\nthe symmetries used for reduction up to that point, must yield the sum of\nalready used symmetries scaled with appropriate coefficients:\n[Xi , Z] = cjik+1 Xj ,\n\nB\n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\n\nAlternative Derivation of Convertible Symmetry Properties\n\nThe reduction of the n-th order equation \u25b3n possessing symmetries X, Y\nand Z from the complete solvable algebra of symmetries, is presented in the\nfollowing diagram\n\u25b3n\n\u2193X\n\u25b3n\u22121\n\u2193 \u1ef8\n\u25b3n\u22122\n\nL(X, Y, Z, ......)\nL(1) (\u1ef8 (1) , ...), Z\u0303 (1),N , ... .\nL(2) (Z\u0303 (2) , ...), ...\n\nWe adopt the convention that X = X1 , Y = X2 and Z = X3 . Following\nthe first reduction using vector field X, we assume that Y remains a point\nsymmetry so that the condition\n[X, Y ] = \u03bbX,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03bb equals zero or it may be scaled to 1, must be satisfied, i.e., X and\nY must form a 2-dimensional subalgebra. In order for Z to reappear as a\n\n17\n\n\fpoint symmetry following reductions by X and \u1ef8 , we again use the result\nproved in the Appendix A, namely that\n[Y, Z] = cX + dY.\n\n(29)\n\nSince only symmetries X and Y have been used previously, there are no\nadditional terms on the right hand side of the above equation. For the\nnon-local symmetry Z\u0303 (1),N the following condition has to be satisfied\n[X, Z] = bX + Y.\n\n(30)\n\nwhere we have scaled the coefficient of Y to 1. In this case also we have\nused the property proved in the Appendix A. Hence, we obtain the following\nconditions upon symmetries X, Y and Z,\n[X, Y ] = \u03bbX,\n[X, Z] = bX + Xk ,\n[Y, Z] = cX + dY.\nin addition to the Jacobi identity which holds for X, Y and Z:\n[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y ]] = 0.\nA straightforward calculation of the Jacobi identity yields\n\u03bbdX \u2212 \u03bbY = 0\nso assuming dX 6= Y we obtain\n\u03bb = 0.\nTherefore, in order for the symmetry Z to disappear during the first reduction and reappear following the second reduction it is necessary that\nfollowing conditions be fulfilled:\n[X, Y ] = 0,\n[X, Z] = bX + Y,\n[Y, Z] = cX + dY.\n\n18\n\n\f"}
