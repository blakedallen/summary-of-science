In the decay of a \u03c0 +\nor \u03c0 \u2212 meson all muon neutrinos, respectively anti-muon neutrinos, of the cubic\nlattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons are emitted. The sum of the oscillation energies of all\nneutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is the same as the sum of the oscillation energies of the\nremaining neutrinos in the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons. Consequently the mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons\nis equal to m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 0.7 * 109 m(\u03bd\u03bc ) \u2248 0.75 m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ), within 1% in agreement with\nthe measured ratio m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) / m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0.757028.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a previous paper [1] we have found that the ratios of the masses of the\nso-called stable mesons and baryons of the \u03b3-branch of the spectrum of the\nstable elementary particles are integer multiples of the mass of the \u03c0 0 meson\nwithin, on the average, 0.73%. We have explained this empirical fact with\nthe standing wave model [2]. The ratios of the masses of the neutrino branch\nof the stable particle spectrum are integer multiples of the mass of the \u03c0 \u00b1\nmesons times a common factor 0.86 \u00b1 0.02 [1]. We have explained the ratios\nof the masses of the particles of the \u03bd-branch with the standing wave model\nin [3]. Surprisingly we can also explain the ratio of the mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons\nto the mass of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons with the standing wave model.\n\n2\n\nThe mass of the muons\n\nThe mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons is m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 105.658389 \u00b1 3.4*10\u22125 MeV, according\nto the Particle Physics Summary [4]. The muons are stable, their lifetime\nis \u03c4\u03bc = 2.19703 * 10\u22126 \u00b1 4 * 10\u221211 sec, about a hundred times as long as the\n1\n\n\flifetime of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, that means longer than the lifetime of any other\nelementary particle, but for the electrons, protons and neutrons. The muons\nare part of the lepton family which is distinguished from the mesons and\nbaryons not so much by their mass as the name lepton implies, actually the\nmass of the \u03c4 meson is about twice the mass of the proton, but rather by the\nabsence of strong interaction with the mesons and baryons. The masses of\nthe leptons are not explained by the standard model of the particles.\nComparing the mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons to the mass of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 139.56995 MeV we find that m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0.757028 \u2248 3/4 or\nthat m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 33.91156 MeV = 0.24297*m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) or \u2248 1/4 * m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ).\nThe mass of the electron is approximately 1/206 of the mass of the muon,\nthe contribution of m(e) to m(\u03bc) will therefore be neglected in the following.\nWe assume, as we have done in [2] and [3] and as appears to be natural,\nthat the particles, including the muons, consist of the particles into which\nthey decay. The \u03bc+ meson decays via \u03bc+ \u2192 e+ + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc + \u03bde . The muons are\napparently composed primarily of the neutrinos which are already present\nin the cubic neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons according to the standing\nwave model [3]. The \u03c0 + meson decays via \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + \u03bd\u03bc or the conjugate\nparticles in the decay of the \u03c0 \u2212 meson, with 99.988% of the \u03c0 \u00b1 decays in this\nform. The energy m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) \u2248 1/4 * m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) is lost when a \u03bc+ meson\nand a muon neutrino \u03bd\u03bc , respectively a \u03bc\u2212 and an anti-muon neutrino \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\nare emitted by the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. The rest of the energy in the rest mass of\nthe \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons passes to the rest mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons. In the standing\nwave model of the particles of the neutrino branch [3] the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons are\ncomposed of a cubic lattice consisting of N/2 = 0.71*109 muon neutrinos \u03bd\u03bc\nand the same number of anti-muon neutrinos \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , (m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = m(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc )), as well as\nof N/2 electron neutrinos \u03bde and the same number of anti-electron neutrinos\n\u03bd\u0304e , (m(\u03bde ) = m(\u03bd\u0304e )), plus the oscillation energy of these neutrinos. We found\nin [3] that the mass of a single muon neutrino should be 50 milli-eV/c2 , and\nthe mass of a single electron neutrino should be 5 meV/c2 . Using these values\nof N and of the neutrino masses we find two intriguing \"coincidences\".\n(a) The difference of the rest masses of the \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03bc\u00b1 mesons is nearly\nequal to the sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos respectively antimuon neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons.\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 33.912 MeV versus N/2 * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = 35.675 MeV.\n(b) The energy in the oscillations of all neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is\n2\n\n\fnearly the same as the energy in the oscillations of all \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , respectively \u03bd\u03bc ,\nand \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos in the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons.\nEosc (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 N[m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )] = 61.09 MeV versus\nEosc (\u03bc\u00b1 ) = m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) \u2212 N/2 * m(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) \u2212 Nm(\u03bde ) = 62.85 MeV.\nBoth statements are, of course, valid only within the accuracy with which\nthe number 2N of all neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice is known, as well as within\nthe accuracy with which the masses m(\u03bd\u03bc ) and m(\u03bde ) have been determined\nin [3]. It cannot be expected that this accuracy is better than a few percent,\nconsidering in particular the uncertainty of the lattice constant.\nIn the two-body decay of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons each decay product has the\nsame and specific momentum p which is p = 30 MeV/c in the rest frame,\naccording to the Particle Physics Summary [4]. The momentum of the decay\nparticles translates into a kinetic energy which for the \u03bc mesons is Ek (\u03bc\u00b1 )\n= 4.1 MeV, and for the single emitted muon neutrino with a practically\nvanishing rest mass Ek (\u03bd\u03bc ) = 30 MeV. Hence the kinetic energies of the two\ndecay products of the \u03c0 \u00b1 meson is 34.1 MeV, which is, as must be, practically\nequal to m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 33.9 MeV. In terms of our model of the neutrino\nlattice in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons and the statement (a) above this means that the\nrest masses of all muon neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons are converted into kinetic\nenergy. All but one of the 0.7 * 109 muon neutrinos disappear in the decay of\nthe cubic neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. We learn from the high energy\ncollision e+ + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212 that \u03bc mesons, and the neutrinos which are part\nof the \u03bc meson masses, can be created directly out of the kinetic energy of\nthe electrons and positrons in the e+ + e\u2212 collision. What we observe in the\n\u03c0 \u00b1 decay is the reverse process, the conversion of the energy in neutrino rest\nmasses into kinetic energy.\nWe note that the difference of the rest masses m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) provides an\nindependent check of the value of the rest mass of the muon neutrino. Using\nN/2 = 0.7135*109 and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 33.912 MeV it follows that the rest\nmass of the muon neutrino should be m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = 47.53 meV/c2 , whereas we\nfound m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = 50 meV/c2 in [3].\nSince the decay of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons seems to mean the removal of all \u03bd\u03bc ,\nrespectively, all \u03bd\u0304\u03bc neutrinos from the neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, the\nmuons should contain the remaining neutrinos of the original cubic lattice,\nthat means N/2 anti-muon neutrinos \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , respectively, N/2 muon neutrinos\n\u03bd\u03bc , plus N/2 electron neutrinos \u03bde as well as N/2 anti-electron neutrinos \u03bd\u0304e .\nIt can be shown immediately that the concept that the muons consist of three\n3\n\n\ftypes of neutrinos and their oscillation energies leads to the correct mass of\nthe muons. The energy E in the rest mass of the \u03bc mesons must be equal to\nthe oscillation or average kinetic energy of all neutrinos in the particle plus\nthe energy in the rest masses of the neutrinos. From E = Ek + \u03a3m(\u03bd)c2\nfollows the elementary formula Eq.(18) in [3], which applied to the case of\nthe muons is\nE(\u03bc\u00b1 )\nEk (\u03bc\u00b1 ) 1 + \u03a3m\u2032 c2 /Ek (\u03bc\u00b1 )\n=\n*\n.\nE(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\nEk (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) 1 + \u03a3mc2 /Ek (\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n\n(1)\n\nWith the empirical Ek (\u03bc\u00b1 ) = m(\u03bc\u00b1 )0 c2 \u2212 \u03a3m\u2032 c2 = 62.9 MeV and the empirical Ek (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )0 c2 \u2212 \u03a3mc2 = 61.1 MeV, where \u03a3m\u2032 c2 = N/2 * 50\nmeV + N * 5 meV (the sum of the energies of the rest masses of the anti-muon\nneutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos in the \u03bc+ meson),\nand \u03a3mc2 = N * 50 meV + N * 5 meV (the sum of the energies of the rest\nmasses of the four neutrino types in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons), it follows that\nE(\u03bc\u00b1 )/E(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0.75763 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhereas the measured ratio is E(\u03bc\u00b1 )/E(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0.757028. That means that\nthe concept of the muons consisting of three neutrino types plus their oscillation or kinetic energy leads to the correct ratio of the mass of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons\nto the mass of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons.\n\n3\n\nThe oscillation energies of the neutrinos\n\nThe neutrinos in the body of a muon must oscillate because the collision\ne+ +e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ +\u03bc\u2212 tells that a continuum of frequencies must be present in the\nmuons, if Fourier analysis holds. The continuum of frequencies from Fourier\nanalysis can be absorbed by the continuous spectrum of the oscillations in\na neutrino lattice. The energy of the oscillations of the neutrinos in the\nmuon lattice is the sum of the energies of a plane oscillation in an isotropic,\ndiatomic lattice consisting of N/2 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc neutrinos and N/2 \u03bde neutrinos, part of\nthe remains of the diatomic neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, plus the energy\nof the diatomic oscillations of N/2 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and N/2 \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos which neutrinos\nwere likewise in the lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. The latter oscillations are\nlikely to be perpendicular to the first mentioned diatomic oscillations in the\nmuon, because the \u03bd\u0304e , \u03bde neutrino pairs are oriented perpendicular to the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\n4\n\n\f\u03bd\u0304e neutrino pairs in the original cubic lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, see Fig. 1 of\n[3].\nThe energy of the oscillations of the lattice is given by\nZ Z\n\n\u03c0\nNh\u03bd0\nf (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) d\u03c61 d\u03c62 ,\n(3)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u2212\u03c0\nas in Eq.(17) of [3] or in the original paper of Born and v.Karman [5], Eq.(50)\ntherein. The oscillation energy of the diatomic lattice containing the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and\n\u03bde neutrinos of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons is 1/2 of the oscillation energy of the diatomic\nlattice oscillations in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons because the number of the pairs \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and\n\u03bde in the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons is 1/2 of the number of the corresponding pairs \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nand \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304e in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. The functions f(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) in Eq.(3)\ndescribing the frequency spectrum of the oscillations are the same for the\ndiatomic neutrino pairs in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons and the diatomic neutrino pairs\nin the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons. The functions are given by Eq.(6) of [3]. Since both\nfunctions are the same the ratio of the energy in the diatomic \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde lattice\noscillation of the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons to the energy of the diatomic lattice oscillations\nin the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is = 1/2 according to Eq.(3). But since the same applies\nfor the diatomic oscillations of the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304e pairs in the \u03bc\u00b1 mesons, the sum of\nthe energies of both oscillations is equal to the oscillation energy of the \u03c0 \u00b1\nmesons, as (b) says.\nSince the frequencies of the diatomic oscillations are a quadratic function of \u03bd there exists for each positive frequency also a negative frequency\nof the same absolute value. That means, according to (3), that the sum of\nthe energies of the oscillations with negative frequencies is negative, but has\nthe same absolute value as the sum of the energies of the oscillations with\npositive frequencies. That means that each muon has an antiparticle. In the\nantiparticle of a particular muon the oscillation energy of the neutrinos is\nreplaced by the oscillation energy of the frequencies with the opposite sign,\nand the masses of the neutrinos are replaced by the masses of their antineutrinos, which have the same absolute value of the masses they replaced. The\nenergy in the mass of a muon is consequently equal to the energy in the mass\nof its antiparticle, as it is with the masses of the particles of the \u03b3-branch\nand of the \u03bd-branch, and with the masses of the \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 mesons.\nFinally we ask why do the muons not interact strongly with the mesons\nand baryons? In [6] we have shown that a strong force emanates from the\nsides of a cubic lattice. This force is caused by the unsaturated weak forces\nof about 106 neutrinos at a side of the surface of the neutrino lattice of the\n\nEosc =\n\n5\n\n\fmesons and baryons. The existence of such a force follows from the study\nof Born and Stern [7] which dealt with the forces between two parts of a\ncubic lattice cleaved in vacuum. If the muons have a lattice consisting of \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\nrespectively \u03bd\u03bc , and \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos the lattice surface is not the same\nas the surface of the cubic \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e lattice of the mesons and baryons,\nas described by the standing wave model [2,3]. Therefore it does not seem\nlikely that the muons interact in the same way with the mesons and baryons\nas the mesons and baryons interact with each other. To put this in another\nway, a triclinic lattice does not bond with a cubic lattice.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIt has been shown that the mass of the muons can be explained as the\nsum of the rest masses of 0.71 * 109 muon neutrinos, respectively anti-muon\nneutrinos, and of the same number of electron neutrinos and anti-electron\nneutrinos, plus their oscillation energies. The three neutrino types in a muon\nare the remains of the cubic neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons from which the\nmuons are formed in the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay. The mass of the muons differs from the\nmass of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons by the sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos,\nrespectively of all anti-muon neutrinos which are in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. All\nmuon neutrinos of one type are emitted when the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons decay. Since\nthe sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos of one type in the \u03c0 \u00b1\nmesons is approximately 1/4 of the rest mass of \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, and since the\noscillation energies in \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03bc\u00b1 are the same, the mass remaining in the \u03bc\u00b1\nmesons after the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay is \u2248 3/4 * m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ), within 1% in agreement with\nthe measured ratio m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0.757028. We have also found that the\nmuons do not interact with the mesons and baryons in the same strong way\nas the mesons and baryons interact with each other.\nThe explanation of the mass of the muons and of their weak interaction\nis a straightforward consequence of our standing wave model of the stable\nmesons and baryons.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.L.
