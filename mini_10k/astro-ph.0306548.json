We, especially, carefully solve the behavior of\nthe innermost part of the disk, since it produces significant number of photons during the burst, and fit\nthe theoretical spectra with the multi-color disk model. The fitting parameters are Tin (the maximum\ndisk temperature) and Rin (the innermost radius of the disk). We find an abrupt, transient increase in\nTin and a temporary decrease in Rin during a burst, which are actually observed in GRS 1915+105. The\nprecise behavior is subject to the viscosity prescription. We prescribe the radial-azimuthal component\nof viscosity stress tensor to be Tr\u03c6 = \u2212\u03b1\u03a0(pgas /p)\u03bc , with \u03a0 being the height integrated pressure, \u03b1 and\n\u03bc being the parameter, and p and pgas being the total pressure and gas pressure on the equatorial plane,\nrespectively. Model with \u03bc = 0.1 can produce the overall time changes of Tin and Rin , but cannot give\nan excellent fit to the observed amplitudes. Model with \u03bc = 0.2, on the other hand, gives the right\namplitudes, but the changes of Tin and Rin are smaller. Although precise matching is left as future\nwork, we may conclude that the basic properties of the bursts of GRS 1915+105 can be explained by our\n\"limit-cycle oscillation\" model. It is then required that the spectral hardening factor at high luminosities\nshould be about 3 at around the Eddington luminosity instead of less than 2 as is usually assumed.\nSubject headings: accretion: accretion disks, black holes-stars: X-rays\n1. introduction\n\nMicroquasars in our Galaxy are enigmatic objects on account of their curious time variability, extremely large brightness\n(Belloni et al. 1997a, 1997b; Mirabel et al. 1994; Rao, Yadav, & Paul 2000), and energetic super-luminal jets (Mirabel\n& Rodriguez 1998). Large numbers of broad-band observations have been so far performed, revealing that they are low\nmass X-ray binaries including black holes and that the accretion flow around the black hole illuminates via the release of\nthe gravitational energy. Their long-term bursts (\u223c months) could be triggered by a thermal instability in the disk (e.g.\nMineshige & Wheeler 1989), however, the mechanism causing their short-term peculiar behavior is not well understood\nyet (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1999; Belloni et al. 2000; Naik et al. 2002). From the theoretical viewpoints, it is interesting\nto investigate how their time-dependent properties of accretion disks can be understood in the frame work of the disk\nmodels.\nAmong plenty of Galactic black-hole candidates, GRS 1915+105, most famous microquasar, is unique in exhibiting\nquasi-periodic luminosity variation (Belloni et al. 1997a, 1997b). Yamaoka, Ueda & Inoue (2001) analyzed the X-ray data\nof GRS 1915+105, taken by ASCA and RXTE during 1998-2000 and found that it exhibits mainly two branches in its\nhigh luminosity state: the high temperature branch (HTB), kT \u223c 2 keV, and the low temperature branch (LTB), kT . 1\nkeV (see also Belloni 2002). The transition time between them is \u223c 1 s. Interestingly, both states can be fitted by the\nmulti-color disk model (hereafter, MCD; Mitsuda et al. 1984), however, what is puzzling in their HTB data is too high\ntemperature and too small inner radius (Rin \u223c 20 km) to account for within the framework of the standard disk model for\nblack-hole candidates (BHCs). It is interesting to note, in this respect, that a similar puzzle is known in ultra-luminous\ncompact X-ray sources (ULXs, see Makishima et al. 2000, Mizuno, Kubota & Makishima 2001). In this case, several\npossibilities have been discussed; rotating black-hole hypothesis (Makishima et al. 2000), moderate beaming effects (King\net al. 2001), and the shift of the inner edge of the disk in super-critical accretion regimes (Watarai, Mizuno, & Mineshige\n2001, hereafter WMM01).\nThen, why is GRS1915+105 so unique? What parameter is peculiar to GRS 1915+105? The fact that its luminosity is\nvery large, comparable to the Eddington luminosity, indicates that this source seems to suffer very high mass accretion\nflow. The accretion disk theory predicts that an accretion disk becomes secularly and thermally unstable, when the mass\naccretion rate is very high so that the disk is radiation pressure-dominated (Lightman & Eardley 1974; Shibazaki & H\u014dshi\n1975; Shakura & Sunyaev 1976). What are then the observable consequences of such an unstable accretion disk?\nAs for the solution of accretion flow at accretion rates exceeding the critical rate (\u1e40crit = LE /c2 ), Abramowicz et al.\n(1988) found a self-consistent, steady-state solution, which is now known as the \"slim disk.\" It was then suggested that\na near-critical disk may undergo limit-cycle oscillations, like the case of dwarf-nova outbursts, between the gas pressuredominated standard disk and the slim disk (Kato 1983; Abramowicz, Lasota, & Xu 1986). Honma, Matsumoto & Kato\n1\n\n\f2\n\nModel for GRS 1915+105: Variable Inner Edge\n\n(1991, hereafter HMK91) were the first to numerically demonstrate limit-cycle oscillations between the two different states\nbased on the slim disk model. They show that an existence of the enough radiation pressure dominated region is essential\nfor developing the thermal instability. Szuszkiewicz & Miller (1997, 1998) confirmed their results for wider \u03b1 parameter\nranges. The X-ray spectral variability of these oscillations was calculated by Zampieri, Turolla, & Szuszkiewicz (2001),\nwho discussed the spectral behavior in each state and the corresponding hardening factor. More recently, Szuszkiewicz &\nMiller (2001) calculated the non-linear evolution of the disk with diffusion type viscosity, which is a more physical, and\ncould also reproduce limit-cycle oscillation as in previous papers.\nIn the present study, we pay special attention to the behavior of the innermost region. The steady calculation of the\nslim disk indicates that a super-critical accretion flow can emit substantially from the part even inside 3rg , since large\namount of gas exists inside 3rg because of high mass accretion flow. Therefore, it has been anticipated to see a temporary\nreduction of the radius of the inner edge of the disk during a burst (Watarai et al. 2000; Mineshige et al. 2000). To\nexamine if this is the case, we carefully calculate the time evolution of the innermost part of a super-critical flow, compare\nthe theoretical results with observations, and discuss the possibility of obtaining a simpler proof for the existence of the\nsuper-critical accretion and thus probing the disk-instability to be a cause of the light variations of GRS 1915+105. Note\nthat previous calculations were all performed down only to the radius of \u223c 2.7rg (as in HMK91) or \u223c 2.5rg (Szuszkiewicz\n& Miller 1997, 1998, 2001; Zampieri et al. 2001) so that an important fraction of the total radiation release might have\nbeen missed. In the present study, we calculate the disk structure down to \u223c 2.2 \u2013 2.4rg , well inside the sonic radius,\nto see an observable feature in terms of the fitting parameters more clearly. This smaller boundary is critical to test the\ndisk-instability scenario for GRS 1915+105.\nIn the next section we present the basic equations and our model assumptions. We show the results of the timedependent calculations of the flow in section 3. The comparison with the X-ray observation of the microquasar GRS\n1915+105 is discussed in section 4. The last section is devoted to conclusions.\n2. basic equations and numerical methods\n\nThe methods of calculation are nearly the same as those by HMK91 (see Kato, Fukue, and Mineshige 1998 for the\ndetailed discussion on the basic equations). The basic equations are written by using the cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6, z).\nThe assumptions of our calculation are; (i) a disk is axisymmetric,\n(ii) pseudo-Newtonian potential (Paczy\u0144sky & Wiita\n\u221a\n1980) is adopted; that is, \u03c8 = \u2212GM/(R \u2212 rg ) with R \u2261 r2 + z 2 , and (iii) we employ one zone approximation toward the\nvertical direction. Here, rg is the Schwarzschild radius defined by 2GM/c2 = 3 \u00d7 106 (M/10M\u2299) cm. We use the height\nintegrated quantities, such as\nZ H\n\u03a3=\n\u03c1dz = 2IN \u03c1H,\n(1)\n\u2212H\n\nand\n\u03a0=\n\nZ\n\nH\n\npdz = 2IN+1 pH.\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212H\n\nHere, \u03a3, \u03a0, \u03c1, p, and H are surface density, height integrated pressure, mass density, total pressure, and scale height,\nrespectively. The coefficients, IN and IN +1 , are introduced by H\u014dshi (1977). The density and pressure are related to\neach other by the polytropic relation, p \u221d \u03c11+1/N .

In the\nlimit of vanishing \u03bc, we recover the ordinary \u03b1 viscosity prescription (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). If we take the limit of\n\u03bc \u2192 1, on the other hand, the viscosity depends on the gas pressure only (Sakimoto & Coroniti 1981).\nFinally, the energy equation is\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(r\u03a3\u01ebtot ) +\n[r(\u03a3\u01ebtot + \u03a0)vr \u2212 rTr\u03c6 v\u03c6 ] = \u22122rF \u2212 ,\n(9)\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\nin which advective cooling, viscous, and radiative cooling are considered.

We solve equations (5)\u2013(7) and (9) by modified Lax-Wendroff method with artificial viscosity.\nTo examine the behavior of the innermost part of the accretion flow, the calculations are performed from the outer\nradius at 2000rg down to the inner radius \u223c 2.2rg through the transonic point (Matsumoto et al. 1984). The number of\ntotal mesh is 400 \u223c 500 and each mesh point is distributed uniformly on the logarithmic scale at large radii, r > 3.2rg ,\nand also uniformly but on the linear scale at smaller radii, where each mesh size is \u223c 0.01rg . We fixed the black-hole\nmass to be m = 10 (m = M/M\u2299 , where M\u2299 is solar mass) and the viscosity parameter to be \u03b1 = 0.1. The critical\naccretion rate, \u1e40crit , is defined by LE /c2 , where LE is the Eddington luminosity and c is the speed of light. We define\nthe dimensionless accretion rate to be \u1e41 \u2261 \u1e40 /\u1e40crit = \u1e40 c2 /LE throughout the present study.\n3. time evolution of the inner disk\n\n3.1. Bolometric Light Curves\nWe first show the calculated light curves for models with \u03bc = 0 (by the solid curve), 0.1 (by dotted curve) and 0.2 (by\nthe dashed curve) in figure 1. The bolometric luminosity is calculated by integrating 2\u03c0F \u2212 (r) from the inner edge at\nr = 2.2rg (at r = 2.4rg for \u03bc = 0.1 case) to the outer edge at r = 2000rg . Eddington luminosity for a 10M\u2299 black hole is\n1.25 \u00d7 1039 (M/10M\u2299) erg s\u22121 . For simplicity, we assume blackbody radiation field (see section 3.4 for corrections).\nIn model with \u03bc = 0, the disk luminosity suddenly rises on timescale of . 5(M/10M\u2299)s, keeps a high value for\n\u223c 10(M/10M\u2299)s, and then decays. These time scales roughly correspond to the viscous timescale, tvis \u223c \u03b1\u22121 \u03a9\u22121 (r/H)2 ,\nin the inner region. Namely,\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22122\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00133/2 \u0010\nM\n\u03b1 \u0011\u22121 H/r\nr\ntvis \u223c 1.6\nsec.\n(13)\n10M\u2299\n5rg\n0.1\n0.1\nThe amplitude of the burst is about one order of magnitude. Here, we calculated the same model as that in HMK91,\ni.e., \u03bc = 0, \u1e41 = 0.96, m = 10, and \u03b1 = 0.1. We confirmed that the amplitude and the duration of the burst in our\ncalculation agree with those of HMK91 (tburst \u223c 15 second for this parameter set). We continued calculations until \u223c\n2000 second (that is, 2\u00d7107 (rg /c) calculation steps), however, we could not obtain a next burst in the same parameters\nas those in HMK91. In our calculation, small oscillations (or small bursts) took place near to the critical accretion rate\nfor many times. Moreover, \u03bc = 0 model takes a lot of recurrence time so that observational feature of GRS1915+105 does\nnot agree with \u03bc = 0. Hence, we will show \u03bc = 0.1 model instead of \u03bc = 0 model in the next section.\nIn model with \u03bc = 0.2, in contrast, the amplitude of the burst is less, only about \u223c 2 mag (about a factor of \u223c 6\nvariations). The burst rise time is somewhat longer than in the previous case but not significantly. Both of the bolometric\nlight curves look quite similar to those obtained by HMK91, who also found that the burst amplitude and time scale are\nsensitive to the parameter, \u03bc. The different burst amplitudes can be understood in terms of the different shapes of the\nS-shaped thermal equilibrium curves, since the ranges of surface density (and thus of effective temperature), in which\nsolutions are unstable, shrinks with increasing \u03bc (HMK91). We will explain detailed evolution in the next two subsections.\n\n\f4\n\nModel for GRS 1915+105: Variable Inner Edge\n\nLbol/LE\n\n1\n\n\u03bc =0.2\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bc =0.1\n\u03bc =0\n0.01\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\ntime [(M/10Msun) sec]\nFig. 1.- Bolometric light curves for different \u03bc parameters (\u03bc=0, 0.1 and 0.2).

State transition: case of \u03bc = 0.1\nAs we mentioned in previous subsection, we can not obtain perfectly relaxed solutions in case of \u03bc = 0 so that we will\nshow \u03bc = 0.1 case. We apply the data at third burst in figure 1, because the first burst is affected by initial conditions.\nFigure 2 illustrates the evolution of the radial distributions of the surface density (top) and effective temperature\n(bottom). We set mass input rate of \u1e41in = 3.0 and \u03bc = 0.1. The numbers in each panel indicate the order of the\nevolution sequence from third burst of \u03bc = 0.1 model in figure 1.\nThe solid curve indicated by the number '1' represents the state before the burst. In the prior burst state, radiation\npressure exceeds the gas pressure from \u223c 5rg to 20rg .\nInitially, there is little mass inside 3rg (this radius corresponds to the radius of the marginally stable circular orbit\naround a non-rotating black hole). Surface density abruptly drops by 4 orders of magnitude inside 3rg in the initial state,\nbecause the radial velocity of the gas prominently increases near the transonic point. After \u223c 5(M/10M\u2299)s, a burst starts.\nA thermal instability is ignited in the innermost region and an upward transition from the radiation pressure-dominated\nstandard-disk branch to the slim-disk one is initiated there. Then, a transition wave propagates outward and the outer\nzone subsequently undergoes an upward transition. Once the instability sets out, the efficiency of angular momentum\nextraction becomes largely enhanced, thus, gas in the disk being able to fall into the black-hole rapidly. Thus, surface\ndensity in the inner part shows a rapid decline. This enhanced mass flow fills the inner empty zone, and, hence, the\nsurface density inside 3rg suddenly increases by more than one order of magnitude.\nThe effective temperature distribution also shows interesting features. The most important feature seen around the\npeak is that because of enhanced mass flow toward the innermost part the temperature inside 3rg keeps a rather high\nvalue, > 107 K, so that significant amount of radiation is now expected from there. This property can be seen in figure 11\nof Abramowicz et al. (1988) and in figure 2 of Watarai et al. (2000) have explicitly demonstrated that this is observable.\nIn the high, slim-disk state, the maximum temperature is slightly higher and the inner disk radius becomes smaller than\nin the low, standard-disk state. The radial distribution of the effective temperature in time sequence numbers 3 are\nproportional to r\u22121/2 , which is in good agreement with the analytical prediction (Watarai & Fukue 1999; Wang & Zhou\n1999). We plotted r\u22121/2 , r\u22123/4 slopes in figure 2b, 3b for reference.\nAnother notable feature is found in the subsequent evolution. When the instability wave reaches \u223c 100rg , a downward\ntransition from the slim-disk branch to the standard-disk one begins from the inner region and again propagates outward.\nIn both phases the transition is initiated from the inner region and the instability is propagated outward. Although these\nfeatures are basically the same as those of the previous works (HMK91), we find interesting features in the behavior of\nthe innermost region, which has been unclear in the previous calculations because of the larger truncation radius. This\nproduces interesting observable effects. It should be noted that effective optical thickness at the inner region is more than\nunity during the burst phase. Hence, we can expect thermal emission around the disk inner region.\nOn the other hand, we have confirmed that a relatively large viscosity parameter, \u03b1 \u223c 0.1, is required to reproduce the\nobservations of GRS1915+105. If we adopt a smaller viscosity parameter, which tends to increase surface density and\nthus optical depth, the duration becomes longer than the observed value. Therefore, we conclude that \u03b1 is likely to be\nabout 0.1 and some additional sources, such as metals, may contribute and raise opacities.\n\n\fWatarai & Mineshige\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\nlog \u03a3\n\n5\n\n3\n1 (t=369s)\n2 (t=415s)\n3 (t=426s)\n4 (t=448s)\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r/rg\nr\u22120.75\n\n7\n3\n\nr\u22120.5\n\nlog Teff [K]\n\n2\n1\n6\n\n4\n1 (t=369s)\n2 (t=415s)\n3 (t=426s)\n4 (t=448s)\n\n5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r/rg\nFig. 2.- Time evolution of the surface-density profile (top) and the effective temperature profile (bottom) for the case with \u03bc = 0.1.

The solid curve labeled with the number 1 represents prior burst profile.\nThe thick dashed lines (time sequence 2), dotted lines (time sequence 3), and small dashed lines represent the profiles in the rise, peak, and\ndecay phases, respectively. Black-hole mass and the viscous parameter are M = 10M\u2299 and \u03b1 = 0.1. We assume a constant mass input at a\nrate of \u1e41in = 3.0.\n\n3.3. Different viscosity prescription: case of \u03bc = 0.2\nHonma et al. (1991) used the viscosity prescriptions given by equation (8) and discussed how different prescriptions\naffect the overall disk evolution. They have demonstrated that in the case with \u03bc = 0.25 the burst duration is shorter\nand the amplitude is smaller both by a factor of \u223c 2, compared with the case with \u03bc = 0. That is, modifying viscosity\nprescription leads to drastic changes in the amplitudes of light variations and in the burst duration. We also test the\ncase with \u03bc = 0.2 and display the resultant light variations in figure 1 and the structural evolution in figure 3. Radiation\npressure dominates over gas pressure from \u223c 4rg to 65rg in the initial state (\u1e41in = 3.0).\nInterestingly, some differences are found. Although the surface density and the temperature of the innermost region\nare still variable, the way of time changes are qualitatively different from the previous case. The upper panel of figure\n\n\f6\n\nModel for GRS 1915+105: Variable Inner Edge\n\n3 indicates that the instability evolves less efficiently than in the case with \u03bc = 0. Especially, surface density remains\nvery low inside 3rg even at the peak and the maximum temperature does not exceed 107 K. Moreover, the maximum\ntemperature is reached at \u223c 4 \u2212 6rg unlike the previous case, in which temperature is maximum at the inner edge.\nThe reason for this change can be understood as follows: Non-zero \u03bc values lead to a reduction of \u03b1 when the radiation\npressure is larger than the gas pressure (prad > pgas ). This reduction tends to increase the surface density of the equilibrium\nsolution at a fixed mass accretion rate (since \u03b1\u03a3 \u221d \u1e40 in the steady condition), and the amount of this increase gets\nlarger, as \u1e40 increases. In other words, the S shape of the thermal equilibrium curves get less prominent, as \u03bc increases\n(see Kato et al. 1998, figure 10.4). As a result, the thermal instability tends to be suppressed.\n\n5\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n4\n\nlog \u03a3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 (t=10s)\n2 (t=14s)\n3 (t=23s)\n4 (t=32s)\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r/rg\n7\n\n3\n\nr\u22120.75\n\nlog Teff [K]\n\n2\n1\n\nr\u22120.5\n4\n\n6\n1 (t=10s)\n2 (t=14s)\n3 (t=23s)\n4 (t=32s)\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog r/rg\nFig. 3.- The same as figure 2 but for the case with \u03bc = 0.2 (We prescribe the r-\u03c6 component of the shear stress tensor to be Tr\u03c6 =\n\u2212\u03b1\u03a0(pgas /p)\u03bc ). We assume a constant mass input at a rate of \u1e41in = 3.0. Other parameters are the same as those in figure 2. Note that even\nat the peak surface density abruptly decreases inside 3rg and the temperature maximum is reached outside 3rg , which makes a big contrast\nto the case with \u03bc = 0.1.\n\n3.4. Model Spectral Fitting\n\n\fWatarai & Mineshige\n\n7\n\nWe next perform the spectral fitting to the calculated spectra in the same manner as that adopted by WMM01. First,\nwe calculate the spectra based on our calculation, assuming blackbody radiation at each radius for each time step. Then,\nwe fit the spectra with the MCD model (Mitsuda et al. 1984), from which we can derive the disk maximum temperature,\n0\n0\n0\nTin\n, and the radius, Rin\n, of the region emitting blackbody radiation with Tin\n. Before making a direct comparison with\n0\nthe observations we need the following corrections: (i) The derived value of Rin\nis influenced by the effects of the inner\nboundary condition as well as general relativistic effects; that is, the value tends to be overestimated, in general, compared\n0\nwith the real inner-edge radius. We thus need to introduce a correction factor \u03b7 = 0.41 and set Rin = \u03b7Rin\n(Kubota et\nal. 1998). (ii) Second, the disk spectra are not perfectly blackbody but are modified by the Compton scattering effects,\nwhich lead to spectral hardening (Ross, Fabian, & Mineshige 1992; Shimura & Takahara 1995). Zampieri et al. (2001)\nalso estimated the spectral hardening factor through solving the radiation transfer in the vertical direction, and found\nresults, which mostly agree with Shimura & Takahara (1995). The actual value is \u03ba \u2248 1.7 for stellar mass black hole and\nincreases with increasing \u1e40 .\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to precisely predict the spectral hardening factor due mainly to the uncertainties in metal\nopacities (which depend on the metal ionization stages, amount of incident X-ray photons, etc). Poorly understood diskcorona structure should also modify the model spectra. Also it strongly depends on the line of sight of observation, and\nthe radial motion of the flow. Previous works (Shimura & Takahara 1995; Wang et al. 1999; Zampieri et al.2001) solved\nthe radiation transfer in the vertical direction, assuming that, the photons can escape only in the vertical direction. For\nhigh accretion rate disk, however, the advected flow can trap significant fraction of photons; the photons propagate not\nonly in the vertical direction but also in the radial direction. According to the preliminary results by Ohsuga, Mineshige,\n& Watarai (2003), the spectral hardening factor changes from 1.2 to about 2.3. This hardening factor depends on the disk\nmodel. Thus, the spectral hardening factor possibly exceeds 2.0. In recent study Shimura & Manmoto (2002) also show\nthat the general relativistic effect is important for solving the radiation transfer equations including the photon trapping.\nAccording to their results the hardening factor is more than \u03ba > 100 in extreme Kerr hole and high mass accretion rate\ncase (\u1e41=100). We have not yet reached the consensus what the most appropriate value is. Therefore, we treated the\nhardening factor as a parameter.\nHere we adopt relatively large value \u03ba = 2.0 because of high \u1e40 cases being considered here and set the color temperature\n0\nto be Tin = \u03baTin\n. The effects of inclination angle and Doppler beaming are ignored in the present fitting.\nFigure 4 displays the time variations of the X-ray luminosity, maximum temperature (Tin ), and the inner edge radius\nof the disk (Rin ), from the top to bottom, respectively (we also fitted the initial burst for \u03bc = 0 model).\nWe calculated the X-ray luminosity by using Rin and Tin , following equation (4) in Makishima et al. (2000). In the rise\nphase the luminosity increases by about one order of magnitude, Tin increases by a factor of \u223c 3, and Rin decreases by a\nfactor of \u223c 2. At the end of the decay phase (corresponding to the time sequence 4) we see a transient rise in Rin . This\nis because in this phase the temperature profile is rather flat up to \u223c 50rg so that the fitting is affected by the emission\nfrom this extended regions. However, the transient rise may depend on the energy range used for fitting.\nWe note that to see the significant variation of Rin , we should set the inner boundary of the disk as small as possible.\nInterestingly, however, evolutionary paths are different for the rise and decay phases in these diagrams. We will discuss\nabout the comparison between our model and the observed objects in the next section.\n4. discussion\n\n4.1. Comparison with the observation of Microquasar GRS 1915+105\nWe have calculated the time evolution of a near-critical accretion disk undergoing the relaxation oscillations between\nthe low mass accretion rate branches and high mass accretion rate branches. We, especially, focus our study on the time\nchanges of the apparent inner-edge radius, Rin , and the maximum temperature, Tin , finding peculiar behavior during\nthe course of one burst cycle. In this subsection we discuss to what extent our model calculation can explain the X-ray\nobservations of GRS 1915+105.\nFigure 5 shows the results of the fitting to the observational data of GRS 1915+105 made by Yamaoka et al. (2001)\nbased on the MCD model. It is clearly seen in this figure that the temperature increases and the inner radius decreases\nin the burst phase (see also Taam, Chen, & Swank 1997). This is what we obtained in the calculations with \u03bc = 0.1, thus\nwe can conclude that qualitative features can be explained by our model.\nHowever, the precise fitting is not easy. According to model calculations, the burst properties can vary by changing the\nblack-hole mass, \u03b1 parameter, or viscosity prescriptions. Although the observed time changes of Tin and Rin agree well\nwhen \u03bc = 0.1, the burst amplitude is too large to reconcile with the observation. Model with \u03bc = 0.2, in contrast, can\nreproduce the observed amplitudes of the luminosity variations during the burst, but the shape of the light curve does not\nmatch the observation in the sense that the burst rise is slower than that of the observation. The observed time changes\nin Tin and Rin are not reproduced, neither. That is, we cannot perfectly fit the observations by simply changing the \u03bc\nvalue. Likewise, changing \u03b1 values does not alter the results qualitatively, but just results in changing the timescales.\nIf we take smaller \u03b1, say \u03b1 = 0.01, we will obtain longer burst duration, about 19 s, since the burst duration time is\n\u221d \u03b1\u22120.64 (HMK91).\nWe should also remark that the absolute value of temperature is not well reproduced, since Tin \u223c 1keV in the observations, whereas Tin \u223c 0.6 keV in our model, even if we adopt a large spectral hardening factor of \u03ba \u223c 2.0. To fit the\nobservations during the low-luminosity state, we need to require that there should be additional mechanisms to further\nharden the spectral so as to achieve \u03ba \u223c 3. As mentioned Introduction, this issue is common to other high-luminosity\n\n\fModel for GRS 1915+105: Variable Inner Edge\n\nLx [1038 erg s-1]\n\n8\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n\u03bc=0\n\u03bc=0.2\n\n2\n\nTin [keV]\n\n\u03bc=0.1\n\n\u03bc=0\n\n1.5\n1\n\n\u03bc=0.2\n\n\u03bc=0.1\n\n0.5\n250\n\n\u03bc=0.2\n\nRin [km]\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n\n\u03bc=0\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03bc=0.1\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\ntime [(M/10Msun) sec]\nFig. 4.- Time variations of the X-ray luminosity, LX , the maximum temperature, Tin , and the inner disk radius, Rin , respectively.

Also,\nthe determination of the inclination angle is very important. Recently some authors argue that dissipation of energy in\ndisk corona or in jets can affect the disk evolution (Nayakshin et al. 2000; Janiuk, Czerny, & Siemignowska 2000). They\npropose the phenomenological model, in which they assume the total gas energy in both disk and jet components to be\nconserved and seek for the functional form, which matches the observed burst duration and luminosity. It is then found\nthat that the fraction of the jet energy has to increase during the burst phase to match the observation. However, there\nis no strong physical basis on this suggestion.\nIf some dissipation processes like corona, jet or wind work around the peak, the amplitude of the burst get smaller,\nwhich might help. In other words, we need to somehow modify the S-shaped thermal equilibrium curves by changing\n\n\fWatarai & Mineshige\n\n9\n\nLx [1038 erg s-1]\n\n\u03b1 as a function of temperature, by including dissipation processes in jets or corona at the peak, or something else. It\nmight be interesting to note that the disk-instability model for dwarf-nova outbursts has a similar problem; the constant\n\u03b1 model cannot produce clear-cut outburst-quiescence light curves but instead only exhibits small-amplitude fluctuations\n(see, e.g., figure 1 of Mineshige & Osaki 1985). To fit the observations, therefore, one needs to increase \u03b1 values in the\nhot state, compared with that in the cool state, by a factor of \u223c 3.\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n2.5\n\nTin [keV]\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nRin\u221acosi [km]\n\n0\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\ntime [sec]\nFig. 5.- The same as figure 4 but from the observations of GRS 1915+105 (courtesy of K. Yamaoka). Cross plus dashed lines represent\nthe derived fitting parameters on \u03b1 = 0.1, \u03bc = 0.1 model. We assume the spectral hardening factor \u03ba = 1.7. The inclination angle i and the\ndistance D are assumed to be i = 70 and D = 12.5 kpc (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1994).\n\n4.2. Is there a Kerr black hole?\nIn the high mass-accretion-rate flow, the disk inner edge can be smaller than 3rg even for a non-rotating black-hole\n(Watarai et al. 2000). On the other hand, it is well known that the case of a Kerr black-hole can also explain the high\ndisk temperature and small inner-disk radius, as are observed, because of smaller radius of the marginally stable orbit. If\nthe black hole is an extreme Kerr black hole, especially, the disk inner edge should be as small as 0.5rg .\nRecently, mass estimation was made for the black hole of the microquasar GRS 1915+105, which is 14 \u00b1 4M\u2299 (Greiner\net al. 2001). The corresponding Schwarzschild radius is 42\u00b112\n\u221a km. If we take the face value derived by Yamaoka et\nal. (2001), the inner radius of the disk should be Rin \u2265 Rin cosi \u223c 30 km during the burst, while Rin \u223c 21 km for\nthe extreme Kerr hole. This result seems to rule out the extreme Kerr hole interpretation at least for GRS 1915+105,\nhowever, we should keep in mind that we are only able to detect photons practically from the region outside \u223c 2rg (\u223c\n\n\f10\n\nModel for GRS 1915+105: Variable Inner Edge\n\n82 km) owing to the significant photon redshifts. It thus follows that it is not easy to distinguish whether there exists an\nextreme Kerr black hole or not.\nAt present, therefore, both possibilities (the Kerr hole and the super-critical accretion) are viable, but we can at least\nrule out the extreme Kerr hole case, since then Rin should stay constant at a small value, not depending on the luminosity\nof the disk, contrary to the observations.\n4.3. Uniqueness of GRS 1915+105\nThe greatest mystery involved with GRS 1915+105 resides in why only this source exhibits various types of activities,\nincluding quasi-periodic light oscillations. High mass accretion rates may not be the only reason, since other luminous\nsources, like GS 2023+338, whose luminosities seem to reach the Eddington luminosity (Tanaka 1989) did not record\nsimilar behavior. Further, Kubota et al. (2001) analyzed the X-ray spectrum in some Galactic black hole candidates,\nrevealing that XTE J1550\u2013564, one of the most well-observed microquasars with RXTE, does not behave like GRS\n1915+105 during the outburst, although the spectrum evolution is somewhat similar to that of GRS 1915+105; i.e.,\nTin increases and Rin decreases, as the luminosity increases in their burst phase. They also indicate that the spectrum\nof XTE J1550\u2013564 can be best fit if we add the anomalous (Comptonized) component in the decay phase, whereas no\nsuch component is needed in the rise phase. This means, the disk structure differs in the rise and decay phases. What\ndiscriminates these objects and other canonical black hole X-ray transients? Do other bright ultra-luminous X-ray sources\nshow bursting properties similar to GRS 1915+105 but not observed yet? These still remain unsolved problems.\nIt is interesting to note in this respect that for relatively large viscous parameter, \u03b1 & 0.3, a transition from the optically\nthick standard-disk branch to the optically thin ADAF occurs (Takeuchi & Mineshige 1998). The transition timescale is\nless than a few sec for a stellar mass black-hole (MBH = 10M\u2299 ). It might be that the solution is not unique and some\nhidden parameter triggers the different behavior of near-critical accretion flow.\n5. conclusions\n\nWe calculated the evolution of the inner part of the high-luminosity accretion disk, carefully considering the transonic\nnature of the flow in the innermost region. We obtain the following results:\n1. Our calculations confirm the previous results that the state transitions between the standard-disk and slim-disk branches\noccur during the burst phase. Around the burst peak, the inner edge of the disk lies at < 3rg and there are significant\nphotons coming from the region inside 3rg .\n2. To inspect the X-ray observational features in GRS1915+105, we performed spectral fitting to the calculated spectra\nwith the fitting parameters of Tin and Rin . As to model with \u03bc = 0.1 we find an abrupt transient increase in Tin and\na temporary decrease in Rin during an outburst, both of which were actually observed in microquasar GRS 1915+105.\nHowever, the amplitudes of light variations and the absolute value of Tin are too large to reconcile with the observational\ndata. When \u03bc = 0.2, in contrast, the burst amplitude agrees with the observed one, but the behavior of Tin and Rin differ\nfrom the observed one. It is difficult to match the observation by simply varying \u03b1 or \u03bc. It is also important to note that\nthe fitting results are sensitive to the photon energy range used for the fitting.\n3. To summarize, although the precise fitting is left as future work, we can safely conclude that our \"limit-cycle oscillation\"\nmodel can explain the basic observational features of GRS 1915+105. It is then required that the spectral hardening factor\nat high luminosities close to the Eddington luminosity should be about 3 instead of less than 2 as is usually assumed.\nThis means, we need additional mechanism that causes a further spectral hardening.\nThe authors thank the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics at Kyoto University.
