Recent experiments on pulling\nof polymers and biopolymers (see e.g. [3\u20135]) have enhanced the theoretical interest on the\nunfolding transition a collapsed polymers undergoes when subjected to an external force, f ,\napplied at its extrema. Until very recently, most of the existing studies on this subject dealt\nwith refined version of the mean field studies originally proposed in Ref. [6]. A common\ncharacteristic of such studies is that, for a self-attracting polymer, they predict a first order\nphase transition in any dimension at a critical force fc (T ). At temperatures below the\n\u0398-transition, where the self-attraction prevails, and for an applied force less than fc the\npolymer is in a compact phase. For forces greater than fc the self-attraction is unable to\nmaintain the polymer in its compact conformation and the polymer chain is stretched along\nthe force direction. However in d = 2 extensive Monte-Carlo simulations [7], performed on a\nself-avoiding walk (SAW) model, suggested that the transition is second order. An exactly\nsolvable model, on a lattice of fractal dimension 2, has been analyzed in Ref. [8] and a\nsecond order transition was found at a critical force fc (T ). In Ref. [9] a rationale was given\nfor the change in order of the transition as the spatial dimension, d, goes past 2, by means\nof a renormalization group based argument. Within that framework, it was found that, near\ncriticality, the projection of the end-to-end distance along the force direction per monomer\ngoes like f \u2212 fc , near the phase transition, where f is the force and fc is the critical force.\nNumerical uncertainties are too big to critically test this prediction in the self-avoiding walk\n(SAW) model of Refs. [7, 9]. Furthermore it was predicted [8, 9] that above two dimension\nthe transition line fc (T ) shows a re-entrance at low temperature, i.e. fc (T ) increases at\nlow T and after reaching a maximum it decreases becoming zero at T\u03b8 , the \u0398-transition.\nThis behaviour is similar to the one found in theoretical models of pulling of double strand\nDNA where, however, the re-entrance was found at all d [10\u201312]. Here we will consider a\nsimplified polymer model where the chains are represented by partially directed walks, i.e.\nsteps with negative projection along the x\u2212axis, (1, 0), are forbidden. This model proved\nto be helpful in the past in order to find the phase diagram in the (temperature, fugacity)\nplane for a simplified \u03b8 transition [13\u201317]. We take advantage of previous contributions and\ngeneralize the model to the presence of a pulling force along the direction (1, 0) (see also\n2\n\n\fRef. [18]). Surprisingly in this version the critical force as a function of the temperature\nT can be found analytically. With transfer matrix techniques we find that the end-to-end\ndistance per monomer goes like (f \u2212 fc )1/\u03b6\u22121 , with \u03b6 < 1. With a sophisticated enumeration\ntechnique [16] we show the correlation critical exponent, \u03bd, takes on a non trivial value on\nthe critical line, numerically very close to \u03bd\u03b8 = 2/3, the exponent at the \u0398 transition. It is\nnot clear whether this is an accidental degeneracy or if it can apply also in the undirected\ncase, too. For example in the 3d Sierpinski gasket an exact renormalization leads to a non\ntrivial f -dependence of \u03bd [8]).\nOur work is structured as follows. In Section II, we introduce the model and the basic\nquantities of interest. In Section III, we outline how the transfer matrix can be applied to\nour model, find explicitly the phase diagram (critical line) and give a rough estimate of the\nexponent \u03b6. A scaling argument is proposed to suggest that at criticality \u03bd = \u03b6. In Section\nIV, we review the enumeration technique proposed in Ref. [16], which we use in Section V\nin order to estimate the value of \u03bd on the critical line. In Section VI, we critically analyze\nour scaling ansatz and the hypothesis that \u03bd = \u03b6. Finally, in Section VII we draw our\nconclusions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe model is a DSAW on a two-dimensional square lattice (see Fig. 1), with (nonconsecutive) nearest-neighbor interactions. A force f, directed along the same axis of the\nwalk, is pulling on one end of the DSAW, the other one being fixed. Given a particular\nconfiguration C the energy is\nEC = \u2212\u01ebm \u2212 f Rx ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the number of interacting pairs and \u01eb the energy per pairs, f the modulus of the\napplied force and Rx the longitudinal extension of the walk. Then, the canonical partition\nfunction can be written\nQL = QL (\u03b2\u01eb, \u03b2f ) =\n\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03b2EC ,\n\n(2)\n\nC\n\nwhere L is the number of the steps of the walk and \u03b2 \u22121 = T , is the temperature in units of\nthe Boltzmann constant. From now on will set \u01eb = 1 without loss of generality. From the\ncanonical partition function we construct the grancanonical partition function (generating\n3\n\n\fyi+1\nyi\n\nf\n\nx=i\n\nx=i+1\n\nFIG. 1: An example of DSAW configuration. The quantities yi and the force direction are also\ndisplayed. Thick dashed lines indicate contacts.\n\nfunction),\nG(T, f, z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nL=1\n\nQL z L ,\n\n(3)\n\nz being the step fugacity. The (real) singularity closest to the origin, zc (T, f ), of the generating function Eq. (3) is related to the free energy per monomer as follows\nzc (T, f ) = lim\n\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nln QL\nL\n\n(4)\n\nFrom the singularities of the generating function when f = 0, a complete phase diagram can\nbe extracted (see the next Section and also Refs. [14, 15, 17]). In particular, a discontinuity\nis found in the free energy at a value of T = T\u03b8 , called the \u0398 temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nTRANSFER MATRIX CALCULATIONS AND PHASE DIAGRAM\n\nStarting from the definition of the generating function, Eq. (3), when f = 0, we observe\nthat it can be conveniently rewritten [13, 14] as\nG(T, f, z) =\nwhere GLx =\n\nP\n\nL\n\nX\nLx\n\nGLx (T, z) exp (\u03b2f Lx ),\n\n(5)\n\nQL,Lx z L , QL,Lx being the partition function restricted to walks of total\n\nlength L of which Lx steps are along the x direction.\nThis is useful because now GLx can be written in terms of a transfer matrix, T , of\n\ndimensionality L2y , where Ly is the size of our system along the y-direction[13, 14]. Such a\ntransfer matrix T is defined via its actions on the vectors {vi }i=1,...,L2y , with vi = (yi , yi+1), yi\n4\n\n\fbeing the height of the site in the i\u2212th row which precedes the right-bound horizontal link\nin that column (see Fig. 1), as follows:\nT (vi , vi+1 ) = exp[\u03b2\u01eb (min{|ri |, |ri+1|})\u03b8(\u2212ri * ri+1 )]\n\u00d7 exp[(|ri | + 1) ln z].\n(6)\nwhere ri = yi+1 \u2212 yi and \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step function. It can be shown that G(T, f =\n0, z) develops a singularity when \u03bb, the largest eigenvalue of T , goes through 1 [19]. This\nmeans that for large Lx\nGLx \u221d (\u03bb(T, z))Lx .\n\n(7)\n\nConsequently the force-dependent singularity, zc (T, f ) occurs when\n\u03bb(T, z) exp (\u03b2f ) = 1.\n\n(8)\n\nEq. (8) has a rather deep consequence. In order for the critical fugacity and hence the\nfree energy to display a singularity at a non-zero value of the force, i.e. in order for the\nforce induced unfolding transition to exist as a thermodynamic transition and not only as\na crossover, it is necessary that \u03bb(T, z), the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix when\nthere is no force, has itself a discontinuity as z approaches zc (T, f = 0) \u2261 z0 . Otherwise,\nfrom Eq. (8) it is clear that there can be no such singularity. If there is a transition, then\nwe get the following equation for the critical force:\nfc (T ) = \u2212T lim\u2212 ln \u03bb(T, z).\n\n(9)\n\nz\u2192z0\n\nIn Eq. (9) the value of \u03bb to be put in the right hand side of the equation is the one pertaining\nto the infinite system. \u03bb(T, z) for z slightly less than z0 is plotted in Fig. 3 with a lateral\nsize Ly up to 40. It is rather clear that a singularity has to be expected at z = z0 in the\ninfinite size limit. It was indeed shown [14, 15] that for T < T\u03b8 (T\u03b8 = 0.8205 . . . in this\nmodel) there is a singularity of the grand partition function for z = z0 = exp(\u2212\u03b2) and for\nthis value of the fugacity the biggest eigenvalue is strictly smaller than 1, being:\n\u221a \u0001\nz0 1 + z0\n.\n\u03bb(\u03b2, z = z0 = exp(\u2212\u03b2)) \u2261 \u03bb(\u03b2) =\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 z0\n\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\nfc\n\n0.6\n\nLy = 20\nLy = 40\nexact solution\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nT\n\nFIG. 2: Exact critical line as in Eq. (11) together with points corresponding to estimates with the\ntransfer matrix calculation, with strip size Ly = 20, 40.\n\nThe \u0398 transition temperature is obtained when \u03bb(\u03b2, z = z0 = exp(\u2212\u03b2)) = 1. Consequently,\nthe critical line, fc (T ), is obtained by putting \u03bb(\u03b2) = exp (\u2212\u03b2fc (T )), i.e.:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b2/2)\n,\nfc (T ) = T ln\nexp (\u2212\u03b2) (1 + exp (\u2212\u03b2/2))\n\n(11)\n\nand is plotted in Fig. 2, where also the results obtained with the transfer matrix with system\nsize up to Ly = 40 are displayed. In view of Eqs. (8) and (9), we can define a new critical\nexponent \u03b6 which characterizes the directed self-avoiding walk. From Eq.

It is widely\naccepted that for d > 2 the transition is first order and so \u03b6 = 1. In Ref.

(2),\nusing a powerful method of exact enumeration introduced in [16], that allows us to reach\nlarge values of L.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE METHOD OF ENUMERATION\n\nAs already said, the configurations of the model are directed walks on a two-dimensional\nsquare lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. For convenience, we demand that these\nwalks end with a horizontal segment. Since the walks are directed in the x-direction we can\ndescribe these configurations through the distance ri between two horizontal steps, measured\nin the positive y direction. Thus, we associate to each configuration an N-tuple (r1 , r2 , ..., rN )\nP\ncorresponding to a configuration of total length L = N\ni=1 |ri | + N.\n\nThe energy due to the nearest-neighbor interactions for each of these configurations is\n\n(see Eq. (6))\nU(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = \u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nmin(|ri |, |ri+1|)\u03b8(\u2212ri * ri+1 ).\n\n(14)\n\nIn the following, we assign weights x for steps in the horizontal direction and y for steps\n\n7\n\n\fin the vertical direction. Then, the canonical partition function is\nQL (x, y, \u03c9) =\n\u00d7\n\nL\nX\n\n(xe\u03b2f )N\n\nN =1\n\nX\n\ny L\u2212N \u03c9 U (r1 ,r2 ,...,rN ) ,\n\n|r1 |+|r2 |+...+|rN |=L\u2212N\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = exp(\u03b2).\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\nNow, it is convenient to consider the partition functions ZL = ZL (x, y, \u03c9) for walks of\ntotal length L + 1 which start with a vertical segment of height r. Then, we have\nQL+1 (x, y, \u03c9) =\n\nL\nX\n\nr=\u2212L\n\n(r)\n\nZL ,\n\n(16)\n\n(0)\n\n(note that ZL = xQL (x, y, \u03c9)) which satisfies the following recursion relation\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\nL\u2212|r|\u22121\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\nX\n(r)\n(s)\nZL = xy |r| \u03b4|r|,L + e\u03b2f\n\u03c9 U (r,s) ZL\u2212|r|\u22121 ,\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n\n(17)\n\ns=\u2212L+|r|+1\n\nobtained concatenating these walks.

(18);\n2. using the Eq. (19), we determine how the quantity hRx (L)i/L varies against the\napplied force f .\n\n8\n\n\f1\n\n<Rx>/L\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\nL = 250\nL = 500\nL = 750\nL = 1500\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nforce\n\nFIG. 4: Plot of hRx (L)i/L vs. f for various length, L, of the walk.\nV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe plot of hRx (L)i/L vs. f for various values of L is represented on Fig. 4 at T = 0.4\nwhich is below the \u0398 transition occurring at T\u03b8 \u2243 0.8205.... From Eq. (11) we have\nfc (T = 0.4) \u2243 0.764...\nFrom a careful examination of Fig. 4, we deduce that the quantity hRx (L)i/L decreases\n\nas L\u03bd\u22121 , where the critical exponent \u03bd might depend on the temperature T . In particular\nthe data are consistent with \u03bd < 1 if f \u2264 fc (T ) and \u03bd = 1 if f > fc (T ). In order to find\nmore precise values for the critical exponent, we shall proceed along the same lines of Ref.\n[16].\nAn estimation of the critical exponent through the use of the Pad\u00e9 approximants [20] is\ngiven in Table I.\nOur estimate of the critical exponent, at the critical force, is close to\n\n2\n3\n\n, the \u03bd value at\n\nthe \u0398 point at f = 0 [15, 17].\nTo get a deeper insight, let us define an L\u2212dependent critical exponent \u03bd(L) through the\nformula\n\u03bd(L) =\n\nlnhRx (L)(L + 1)i \u2212 lnhRx (L)(L)i\nln(L + 1) \u2212 ln L\n\n(20)\n\nPlotting \u03bd(L) versus an estimated correction-to-scaling term a careful extrapolation to L \u2192\n\u221e can be performed, determining the critical exponent \u03bd for all the values of the force. Let\nus consider three different regimes:\n1. f < fc .\n9\n\n\ff\n\n\u03bd\n\nL\n\n< fc 0.501(7) \u2264 1900\n= fc 0.68(8) \u2264 1900\n> fc 1.00000 \u2264 1300\n\nTABLE I: Estimates for the critical exponents from a Pad\u00e9 approximants analysis.

We have found that successive estimates for\nthe exponent \u03bd \u2212 1 with increasing L follow a straight line when plotted against a\n\ncorrection-to-scaling term of 1/L0.5 (see also the case of Ref. [16] at f = 0). The plot\n\nis shown in Fig. 5. The extrapolated value for L \u2192 \u221e gives \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2243 \u22120.4998, then\n\n\u03bd \u2243 12 , the exponent typical of a compact phase.\n2. f > fc .\n\nAs before, we have plotted the exponent \u03bd \u2212 1 against a well-defined correction-toscaling term. Now, this term is order of 1/L. Fig. 6 shows the f = 1.0 case as typical\nexample. Now, the extrapolated value gives \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2243 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 , then \u03bd = 1 within the\n10\n\n\f0\n\nf=1.0 > fc\n\n\u22120.001\n\n\u03bd\u22121\n\n\u22120.002\n\n\u22120.003\n\n\u22120.004\n\n\u22120.005\n\n0\n\n0.0005\n\n0.001\n\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\n1/L\n\nFIG. 6: Plot of \u03bd \u2212 1 vs. 1/L, for f > fc and L up to 3000.\n\u22120.28333\n\nf=fc\n\u22120.29333\n\n\u03bd\u22121\n\n\u22120.30333\n\n\u22120.31333\n\n\u22120.32333\n\n\u22120.33333\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n1/L\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.28\n\nFIG. 7: Plot of \u03bd \u2212 1 vs. 1/L0.28 , for f = fc and L up to 3000.\n\nnumerical precision.\n3. f = fc .\nNow, the correction-to-scaling term is of 1/L0.28 (see Fig. 7) and \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2243 \u22120.3336,\nwhich implies \u03bd \u2243 23 .\n\nThus we find that the value of \u03bd for f = fc (T ) is equal (in the limit of numerical precision)\nto the value 32 , which corresponds to that for f = 0 at T = T\u03b8 [15, 17]. This is a non trivial\nresult. In particular, we have to expect that along all the critical line f = fc (T ), \u03bd takes\nthe value 23 . Moreover, as pointed out in [17], the correction-to-scaling term when f = 0\nand T = T\u03b8 is of 1/L1/3 . In our case, we found that this correction increases to 1/L0.28 ,\nfor T = 0.4. Within the numerical errors, this implies that the correction to scaling scaling\n11\n\n\ff\n\n\u03bd\n\n< fc 1/2\n\n= fc 2/3\n\n> fc 1\n\nTABLE II: Estimates for the critical exponents from an extrapolation to L \u2192 \u221e, obtained plotting\nthe L-dependent critical exponent \u03bd(L), Eq. (20), versus an estimated correction-to-scaling term.\n\nterm depends on force as well as on temperature and that the size of our system has to\nincrease in order to find the right critical exponent.\nFinally, in Table II we have summarized the above results.\nIn the next Section, we shall introduce a scaling theory that rationalizes for what we have\nfound on the critical behaviour of the average horizontal end-to-end displacement hRx (L)i.\nVI.\n\nSCALING THEORY\n\nOur previous results suggest the following scaling ansatz (see also Ref. [7]):\nhRx (L)i = L\u03bd \u03a6(\u2206f L\u03c8 )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u2206f \u2261 f \u2212 fc (T ). The scaling function \u03a6(x) must have the following behaviour:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nx(1\u2212\u03bd)/\u03c8\nif x \u2192 +\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03a6(x) \u223c \u03a60\nif x \u2192 0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (1/2\u2212\u03bd)/\u03c8\n|x|\nif x \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\n12\n\n(22)\n\n\fwith \u03a60 a not-zero constant value. Then, the quantity hRx (L)i obeys to the equations:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nL\u2206f (1\u2212\u03bd)/\u03c8\nif \u2206f > 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nhRx (L)i \u223c L\u03bd\nif \u2206f = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1/2\nL |\u2206f |(1/2\u2212\u03bd)/\u03c8 if \u2206f < 0,\n\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\u03c8\n\n>0\n,\n\n1/2\u2212\u03bd\n\u03c8\n\n(23)\n\n<0\n\nin agreement with the results found in the previous Section.\n\nNow, let us observe that the free energy contribution to the singular part is\n\u2206F = hRx (L)if \u2212 hRx (L)ifc = hRx (L)i\u2206f\n= \u2206f L\u03bd \u03a6(\u2206f L\u03c8 )\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have used Eq. (21), f is the applied force and \u03a6\u0303(x) = x\u03a6(x). Since \u2206F is a\ncontribution to the total free energy (not a free energy density), we expect it depends only\non the \"dimensionless\" combination of the scaling fields \u2206f and L with the appropriate\nexponents. This implies that \u03bd = \u03c8.\nComparing Eqs. (13) and (23), we deduce that \u03b6 = \u03bd = 2/3. Then, Eq. (21) becomes\nhRx (L)i = L2/3 \u03a6(\u2206f L2/3 ).\n\nTo test this prediction, we have plotted in Fig. 8 the function L\u22122/3 hRx (L)i versus f \u2212 fc ,\n\nwhere fc is again determined from the exact formula, Eq. (11). It is evident that, apart\nfrom obvious finite size scaling corrections, our ansatz is justified. Then, we have derived\nthe scaling function \u03a6(x). The final result is shown in Fig. 9.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have analyzed a model of self-avoiding partially directed chains on a\nsquare lattice, with a force pulling along one of the two lattice directions. The model is\nsimple enough to yield the exact form of the temperature dependent critical force, fc (T ) (see\nEq. (11)). However, the critical indices of the unfolding transition, which is second order,\nare not trivial. The transition is characterized by two exponents, the usual correlation\nlength critical exponent \u03bd, and one which we called \u03b6. In particular, the exponent \u03bd at\nf = fc (see Eq. (23)) is different both from 1/2, the collapsed polymer value, and from 1,\n13\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\n\u22122/3\n\nL <R x(L)>\n\nL = 800\nL = 1000\nL = 2000\nL = 3000\nL = 4000\n\n1\n\u22120.02\n\n\u22120.01\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nf\u2212fc\n\n0.02\n\nFIG. 8: Plot of hRx (L)i scaled by L2/3 versus f \u2212 fc .

Through a powerful enumeration technique\ntaken from the literature [16], coupled with a finite size scaling to extrapolate our results to\ninfinitely long chains, we find that \u03bd is very close to 2/3. A scaling analysis also suggests\nthat \u03bd = \u03b6 at least within our numerical precision. Further investigations are required to\n\n14\n\n\fextend our results to the undirected SAW case.\n\n[1] A. J. Barrett, C. Domb, J. Stat. Phys. 77, 491 (1994).\n[2] A. L. Owczarek, T.
