In both cases the \u03b1-vacua of de\nSitter space make an interesting appearance.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently there has been renewed interest in using the AdS/CFT correspondence to understand physics in time\ndependent backgrounds (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] In Lorentzian AdS spaces the presence of both normalizable\nand non-normalizable fluctuations and the possibility of interesting causal structure lead to many new phenomena (e.g.,\n[7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]). It has been shown how to compute the different types of propagators (e.g. advanced and\nretarded) and correlation functions that arise in Lorentzian signature in the unique AdS vacuum [7, 8]. (Also see [9].)\nRecent work has discussed how thermal field theory correlators can be computed using the AdS/CFT correspondence\nby a proper identification of boundary conditions in the corresponding AdS backgrounds which have horizons[4, 6].\nFinally, it has been shown that analytic continuations from the Euclidean section in different coordinate systems that\ncover a whole or only part of a spacetime manifold lead to the same observable physics, even when horizons are present\n[10].\nIn general, time-dependent backgrounds have multiple natural vacua. Correlation functions in most of these vacua\ncannot be obtained by analytic continuation of a Euclidean correlator. Also, we expect non-trivial effects such as\ncosmological particle creation to be apparent in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In interesting dynamical situations\nsuch as black hole formation from collapse, the in and out vacua that are natural before and after the black hole forms\nhave very different characters and while the AdS/CFT correspondence naturally computes the hout| * * * |ini transition\namplitude, we must compute hin| * * * |ini correlators to study how the equal time correlation functions can measure\nhorizon formation. In this paper we show how to formulate the correspondence when a non-trivial time dependence\nleads to multiple vacua. We find that properly identifying the various vacua allows us to relate correlators computed in\ndifferent vacuum states by expressions involving cosmological particle production. We also find a simple relationship\nbetween particle production in the bulk supergravity/string theory and in the boundary gauge theory.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we formulate the AdS/CFT correspondence when multiple vacua\nare present and show how various two-point functions are related by particle production effects. We then give two\nexamples of situations with multiple vacua \u2013 Sec. III examines the \"bubble of nothing\" in AdS4 [1, 2], and Sec. IV\nexamines the spacetime formed by placing a bubble of nothing on the boundary of AdS5 . Since the surface of a bubble\nof nothing traces out a de Sitter space the \u03b1-vacua of de Sitter space make an interesting appearance. In section V\nwe present our conclusions. An appendix gives more detail for various computations found in the main text.\nII.\n\nMULTIPLE VACUA AND THE ADS/CFT CORRESPONDENCE\n\nIn this section, we show how to formulate the time dependent version of the AdS/CFT correspondence when\nmultiple vacua are present, and compute some sample two point functions to show how these quantities are altered by\ncosmological particle production. In the original formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence, correlation functions\nin the N = 4 supersymmetric SU (N ) Yang Mills in 4d are related, in the large N limit, to the bulk classical action\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: vijay@endive.hep.upenn.edu\naddress: tslevi@student.physics.upenn.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: naqvi@rutabaga.hep.upenn.edu\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nin Euclidean AdS5 [18, 19, 20] by\nhexp\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\n\n\u03c60 OiCF T = ZSUGRA (\u03c60 ) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03c6 approaches \u03c60 on the boundary, ZSUGRA (\u03c60 ) = exp(\u2212I(\u03c60 )) is the classical IIB supergravity action with\nthe boundary value \u03c60 , and O is the operator dual to the field \u03c6. Technically, correlation functions are computed\nperturbatively by extending boundary values for fields (or sources in the field theory) into the AdS bulk by using\na bulk-boundary propagator and then sewing these together using the usual bulk-bulk propagators to compute the\nAdS/CFT Feynman diagrams. Numerous authors have explored the definition of the correspondence in Lorentzian\nsignature (e.g., [7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17] and the recent works [4, 6, 9, 10].) We are interested in situations in which there\nare several natural choices of vacua. Amplitudes and transition functions will depend on which vacua we sandwich\nour operators between. While it is clear how the choice of vacua is implemented on the CFT side of the duality, it is\ninitially confusing how the SUGRA side, being semi-classical, contains the same data. We will clarify this point.\nIn Euclidean AdS (EAdS) it is well known that specifying a field's behavior on the boundary uniquely specifies it\nthroughout the bulk [19]. In contrast, due to the presence of normalizable mode solutions which can be arbitrarily\nadded on without affecting the boundary behavior, the solution is no longer unique (see [12, 13] for discussion). At\nthe level of Green functions, in EAdS, there exists a unique bulk-boundary two point function, whereas in Lorentzian\nsignature we have a wealth of Green functions to choose from, all dependent on the boundary conditions (or pole\nprescriptions) chosen. We expect these different Green functions to arise from grafting normalizable mode solutions\nonto the bulk-boundary propagator obtained by continuation from the Euclidean section. We will see how doing this\ncorrectly allows one to select between CFT correlation functions evaluated between different vacuum states.\nWhile we will give a prescription for treating multiple vacua in any coordinate system, it is easiest to explain the\nprocedure by choosing a particular behaviour for the metric. The Poincar\u00e9 patch of AdSd+1 is given by\nds2 = l2 /z 2 (\u2212dt2 + dx2 + dz 2 ).\n\n(2)\n\n(We will usually set l = 1.) In (2) the AdS boundary occurs at z = 0 while z = \u221e is a coordinate horizon. Now\nconsider a general time-dependent solution to Einstein's equations with a negative cosmological constant which is\nasymptotically Poincar\u00e9,\nz\u21920\n\nds2 \u2212\u2192 1/z 2(dz 2 + ds\u03032 ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere tilde denotes the boundary metric. As z \u2192 0 the boundary and radial parts of the wave equation separate\nand the solution to the scalar wave equation will be given by \u03c6(z, b) = f (z)\u03c60 (b), where b are the boundary\ncoordinates. As is standard, f (z) has two possible scalings (normalizable\nand non-normalizable) at the boundary,\n\u221a\nnamely limz\u21920 f (z) = z 2h\u00b1 where 2h\u00b1 = d/2 \u00b1 \u03bd and \u03bd = 1/2 d2 + 4m2 [12].\nIf there is a time dependence in the metric we can have multiple choices for vacuum states. We can display this by\nconsidering different expansions for the field \u03c6 over the normalizable modes\nX\nX\n\u03c6(z, b) =\nak uk (z, b) + a\u2020k u\u2217k (z, b) =\na \u0304k u \u0304k (z, b) + a \u0304k \u2020 u \u0304k \u2217 (z, b),\n(4)\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere the uk 's are normalizable solutions. Vacuum states can be defined by\nak |0i = 0, a \u0304k |0\u0304i = 0, \u2200k.\nWe then have the Bogolubov transformation\nX\nX\n\u2217 \u2020\n\u03b1\u2217ki ai \u2212 \u03b2ki\nai ,\n\u03b1ki ui + \u03b2ki u\u2217i , \u0101k =\n\u016bk =\n\nk\n\n\u2217\n\u03b1ik \u03b1\u2217jk \u2212 \u03b2ik \u03b2jk\n= \u03b4ij ,\n\n(6)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nX\n\n(5)\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03b1ik \u03b2jk \u2212 \u03b2ik \u03b1jk = 0.\n\n(7)\n\nWhen \u03b2 6= 0, the two vacua are inequivalent and each is an excited state of the other. For simplicity will assume\nthat the transformation matrices are diagonal, i.e. \u03b1ij = \u03b1i \u03b4ij , \u03b2ij = \u03b2i \u03b4ij . However, the generalization to the\nnon-diagonal case is straightforward, and we will give the necessary relations for it at the end for completeness.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nFinding the bulk-boundary propagator with multiple vacua present\n\nA necessary step in the formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the construction of a bulk-boundary propagator GB\u2202 (b; b\u2032 , z) which allows us to write\nZ\np\n(8)\n\u03c6(z, b) =\ndb \u2212g\u0303GB\u2202 (b; z, b\u2032 )\u03c60 (b)\n\u2202\n\nNote that in the above equation, \u03c6 is really defined up to a normalizable mode; i.e., the bulk-boundary propagator\ncan have arbitrary normalizable modes added on. Our first step will be to compute a time-ordered Green function for\na transition between two, not necessarily equal, vacuum states. Then we will define the bulk-boundary propagator as\na particular limit of the bulk-bulk Green function. The time-ordered bulk propagator is a solution to the equation\n1\n(\u0003x \u2212 m2 )GF (x, x\u2032 ) = \u2212 \u221a \u03b4 d+1 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\u2212g\n\n(9)\n\nThe boundary conditions on GF are selected by adding homogeneous solutions of the wave equation to it.\nAssume that our metric has a natural timelike coordinate (not necessarily a Killing vector), with respect to which\nevents can be ordered. We then have\nh0\u0304|T (\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y))|0i\nh0\u0304|0i\nh0\u0304|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)|0i\nh0\u0304|\u03c6(y)\u03c6(x)|0i\n= \u03b8(x0 \u2212 y 0 )\n+ \u03b8(y 0 \u2212 x0 )\n.\nh0\u0304|0i\nh0\u0304|0i\n\niGF 0\u03040 (x, y) =\n\n(10)\n\nNote that h0\u0304|0i 6= 1 in general. Using eqns.

It has been noted by several authors\n[14, 15, 17] that we can find the bulk-boundary propagator by a simple rescaling of the time-ordered propagator in\nthe radial direction of AdS. Following [15] one can easily show in our coordinates that we can write the bulk-boundary\npropagator as\nGB\u2202 0\u03040 (b; b\u2032 , z \u2032 ) = 2\u03bd lim z \u22122h+ GF 0\u03040 (x, x\u2032 ).\nz\u21920\n\nB.\n\n(14)\n\nFormulation of the correspondence\n\nWith this definition, we can formulate the AdS/CFT correspondence as\nZ\nh0\u0304|T exp i \u03c60 O|0iCF T = ZSUGRA 0\u03040 (\u03c60 ),\n\n(15)\n\n\u2202\n\nwhere the notation on Z implies that we use the 0\u03040 bulk-boundary propagator for writing \u03c6 in terms of \u03c60 . We\nnow have a form of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which takes into account the different boundary conditions at\n\n\f4\nearly and late times describing transitions from various vacua. The different amplitudes in the CFT are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the choice of bulk-boundary propagator in the SUGRA. In addition, if the vacua are related by\na phase (i.e. all the \u03b2s vanish), we have a unique bulk-boundary propagator and a unique vacuum state, hence the\ncorrespondence reduces to the original one. This formulation is particularly useful if we let |0i = |ini and |0\u0304i = |outi\nwhere by |ini and |outi we mean vacua which are natural for inertial observers at early at late times. We can then\nshow that the differences between the vacua are a result of cosmological particle production.\nLet us compute a two point function using the AdS/CFT correspondence to show the effects of having multiple\nvacua. Consider a scalar field in the supergravity whose action is given by\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS[\u03c6] =\ndd w dz \u2212g(g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + m2 \u03c62 ) ,\n(16)\n2\nwhere z is the radial coordinate. The two point function in the CFT for the operator dual to \u03c6 is\nh0\u0304|T (O(x)O(y))|0i\n1 \u03b4 2 Z0\u03040 (\u03c60 )\n|\u03c6 =0 =\n.\ni2 \u03b4\u03c60 (x)\u03b4\u03c60 (y) 0\nh0\u0304|0i\n\n(17)\n\nPlugging in for \u03c6 in terms of the bulk to boundary propagator gives\nh0\u0304|T (O(x)O(y))|0i\n=\nh0\u0304|0i\n\nR\n\n\u221a\ndd w dz \u2212g[g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc GB\u2202 0\u03040 (x; w, z)\u2202\u03bd GB\u2202 0\u03040 (y; w, z) + m2 GB\u2202 0\u03040 (x; w, z)GB\u2202 0\u03040 (y; w, z)], (18)\n\nIntegrating\nby parts, using the facts that GB\u2202 satisfies the bulk equations of motion and that\n\u221a\nlimz\u21920 \u2212g\u0303z 2h+ \u2212d GB\u2202 (x; w, z) = \u03b4 d (w \u2212 x) we are left with the boundary term\nZ\nh0\u0304|T (O(x)O(y))|0i\n= lim \u01eb1\u22122h+ \u03b4 d (w \u2212 x)\u2202z GB\u2202 0\u03040 (y; w, z)|z=\u01eb dd w\n\u01eb\u21920\nh0\u0304|0i\n= lim \u01eb1\u22122h+ \u2202z GB\u2202 0\u03040 (y; w, z)|z=\u01eb .\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n(19)\n\nHence we can conclude that\nhout|T (O(x)O(y))|ini\nhout|ini\ni\nX \u03b2k\n\u2202 h\nu\u2217k (z, b)u\u2217k (z \u2032 , b\u2032 ) \u2032 ,\n+ 2i\u03bd lim \u01eb1\u22122h+ \u2032 z \u22122h+\nz\u21920, \u01eb\u21920\n\u2202z\n\u03b1k\nz =\u01eb\n\nhin|T (O(x)O(y))|ini =\n\n(20)\n\nk\n\nwhere the uk are the natural in modes. Using the scaling as z \u2192 0 of solutions to the wave equation it is easily\nshown that the z dependence drops out, leaving a k dependent multiplicative factor in each term. Thus, this form of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence is sensitive to particle creation effects, as we would expect. Similar expressions can be\nobtained for higher point correlation functions. If we were computing particle creation directly in the dual, strongly\ncoupled CFT, we would have to work with a collective field theory for the gauge-invariant composites (see, e.g., [14]).\nThe quantum numbers of these collective fields would match the quantum numbers of the modes being summed above.\nWhile we have explained the procedure in asymptotically Poincar\u00e9 coordinates, it is simple to generalize to any other\nasymptotically AdS coordinate system. In all cases, the limit will approach the AdS boundary and the the factors of\n\u01eb and z will be replaced by the appropriate scaling behaviours of normalizable modes.\nIn the next two sections we will give two examples of how the above results are used to explore cosmological particle\nproduction.\nIII.\n\nTHE SCHWARZSCHILD-ADS BUBBLE OF NOTHING\n\nIt was pointed out in [1, 2] that following [22] one can form a \"bubble of nothing\" in AdS by analytically continuing\nthe AdS-Schwarzschild black hole solution. Here we construct the AdS4 analog of the solution found in [1, 2]. Start\nwith the solution for the four dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c8 2 )\nr0\nr2\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n+ 2,\nr\nl\n\n(21)\n\n\f5\nwhere r0 is the non-extremality parameter and l sets the length scale. A double analytic continuation t \u2192 i\u03c7,\n\u03b8 \u2192 i\u03c4 + \u03c0/2 gives\nds2 = f (r)d\u03c72 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 (\u2212d\u03c4 2 + cosh2 \u03c4 d\u03c8 2 ).\n\n(22)\n\nThe space is now cut-off at r = r+ where r+ is the larger solution to\nr3 + l2 r2 = r0 .\n\n(23)\n\nTo avoid a conical singularity at r+ , \u03c7 must have a period of\n\u2206\u03c7 =\n\n4\u03c0l2 r+\n2 + l2 .\n3r+\n\n(24)\n\nAs in [2], the boundary metric is de Sitter space times a circle. Recall that de Sitter space has a family of inequivalent\n\u03b1-vacua [23, 24]. For example, in the global de Sitter coordinates appearing within the final parentheses in (22) the\nin and out vacua appropriate to early and late times have non-trivial Bogolubov coefficients. In even dimensional de\nSitter spaces such as the 2d de Sitter factor in (22) this leads to cosmological particle production. It is worth noting\nthat the only conformally invariant de Sitter vacuum is the Euclidean, or Bunch-Davies vacuum, so this might suggest\nthat this is only valid vacuum state for the dual CFT [23]. However, the presence of the additional circle in (22)\nalready provides a scale (see [2]). So there is a priori no reason to discard the other vacua, except in view of various\nother potential difficulties with them [23].\nTo investigate particle production and the AdS/CFT correspondence in this background we must first solve the\nwave equation to obtain the mode expansions. In this background the wave equation \u0003\u03c6 \u2212 m2 \u03c6 = 0, becomes\n\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03c82 \u03c6 \u2212 m2 \u03c6 = 0.\n\u2202\u03c4 (cosh \u03c4 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c6) + 2 \u2202r (r2 f (r)\u2202r \u03c6) + f (r)\u22121 \u2202\u03c72 \u03c6 +\n2\nr2 cosh \u03c4\nr\nr cosh2 \u03c4\n\n(25)\n\nWe can separate \u03c6 as \u03c6(r, \u03c4, \u03c7, \u03c8) = R(r)T (\u03c4 )ein\u03c8 ei(2\u03c0j/\u2206\u03c7)\u03c7 , where n, j are integers. We define p = 2\u03c0j/\u2206\u03c7 and a\nseparation constant k 2 to obtain two ordinary differential equations\nd 2\n(r f (r)R\u2032 (r)) \u2212 (r2 f (r)\u22121 p2 + r2 m2 \u2212 k 2 )R(r) = 0\ndr\nT \u2032\u2032 (\u03c4 ) + tanh(\u03c4 )T \u2032 (\u03c4 ) + (k 2 + n2 / cosh2 \u03c4 )T (\u03c4 ) = 0,\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhere the primes in each equation denote derivatives with respect to the variable of each function. Note that k 2\nshows up in the T equation exactly as a mass would if we were dealing with only the theory on the boundary. The\nradial equation cannot be solved in closed form, however we can obtain the asymptotic behavior as\nR(r) \u2192 r\u22122h\u00b1\n\n(28)\n\u221a\nas r \u2192 \u221e, where 2h\u00b1 = d/2 \u00b1 \u03bd, and \u03bd = 1/2 9 + 4l2 m2 . The modes that scale as 2h+ are normalizable while the\nones that scale as 2h\u2212 are non-normalizable. The radial and angular parts of these solutions will not contribute to\nBogolubov transformations relating different vacua because they will have the same form for any basis of solutions.\nThus we only need to focus on the time dependent equation (27).\nRecall that since de Sitter space has a one complex parameter family of vacua, we could explore the corresponding\none parameter family of inequivalent bases of solutions to (27). However, since our interest is simply to illustrate\nparticle production in an AdS/CFT context we will focus on the in and out vacua appropriate to early and late times.\nWe can then analyze (27) by following [24] to arrive at a solvable equation. We first rewrite the equation in terms of\na new coordinate \u03c3 = \u2212e2\u03c4\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nn2\nk 1\u2212\u03c3\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nTn = 0,\n(29)\n\u2212\n\u03c3(1 \u2212 \u03c3)Tn + (1/2 \u2212 3/2\u03c3)Tn +\n4 \u03c3\n1\u2212\u03c3\np\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to \u03c3 and \u03bc =\nk 2 \u2212 1/4. We make the substitution Tnin =\nn\ncosh \u03c4 e(l+1/2\u2212i\u03bc)\u03c4 f (\u03c3), where the in superscript has been added in anticipation of this solution describing an incoming wave at past infinity. The equation now becomes a hypergeometric equation for f ,\n\u03c3(1 \u2212 \u03c3)f \u2032\u2032 + [c \u2212 (1 + a + b)\u03c3]f \u2032 \u2212 abf = 0,\n\n(30)\n\n\f6\nwhere the coefficients are given by a = n + 1/2, b = n + 1/2 \u2212 i\u03bc, and c = 1 \u2212 i\u03bc. We restrict to the case where \u03bc is\nreal and positive. The full incoming solution is then given by\nTnin = coshn \u03c4 e(n+1/2\u2212i\u03bc)\u03c4 F (n + 1/2, n + 1/2 \u2212 i\u03bc; 1 \u2212 i\u03bc; \u2212e2\u03c4 ).\n\n(31)\n\nwhere F is a hypergeometric function and we have chosen not to normalize since it is not important for our purposes.\nWe note that (42) is invariant under time reversal, and the equation is real. Therefore, we have another set of linearly\nindependent solutions given by Tnout (\u03c4 ) = Tnin\u2217 (\u2212\u03c4 ), or\nTnout = coshn \u03c4 e\u2212(n+1/2+i\u03bc)\u03c4 F (n + 1/2, n + 1/2 + i\u03bc; 1 + i\u03bc; \u2212e\u22122\u03c4 ).\n\n(32)\n\nThe asymptotics of these two solutions are given by\nTnin\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\ne(1/2\u2212i\u03bc)\u03c4 ,\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\nTnout \u2212\u2192 e\u2212(1/2+i\u03bc)\u03c4 .\n\n(33)\n\nThus, our solutions are good candidates for defining in and out vacua respectively.\nThe radial and angular parts of the wavefunction will clearly not play a role in the Bogolubov coefficients between\nthe in and out states. Using the general relation between hypergeometric functions [25]\nF (a, b; c; z) =\n\n\u0393(c)\u0393(b \u2212 a)\n(\u2212z)\u2212a F (a, a + 1 \u2212 c; a + 1 \u2212 b; 1/z) +\n\u0393(c \u2212 a)\u0393(b)\n\u0393(c)\u0393(a \u2212 b)\n(\u2212z)\u2212b F (b, b + 1 \u2212 c; b + 1 \u2212 a; 1/z).\n\u0393(a)\u0393(c \u2212 b)\n\n(34)\n\nwe may compute the relation between Tnin and Tnout and find\nTnin = \u03b1n Tnout + \u03b2n Tnout\u2217\n\n(35)\n\nwith\n\u03b1n =\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 i\u03bc)\u0393(\u2212i\u03bc)\n,\n\u0393(1/2 \u2212 n \u2212 i\u03bc)\u0393(1/2 + n \u2212 i\u03bc)\n\n\u03b2n = \u2212i\n\n(\u22121)n\n.\nsinh(\u03c0\u03bc)\n\n(36)\n\nThe number of particles in the in vacuum for the n-th mode is given by\nhin|Nn |ini = |\u03b2n |2 =\n\n1\n.\nsinh2 (\u03c0\u03bc)\n\n(37)\n\nBecause this is independent of n and of j (the other angular momentum) there will be an infinite amount of particle\nproduction at high momenta. So strictly speaking we should be cutting off our in and out vacua suitably at high\nmomenta, but we will not delve into this here.\nHow is this particle production by the cosmological expansion of the spacetime reflected in the dual CFT? From\n(20), we can see that the hin| * * * |ini correlation function differs from the hout| * * * |ini by a particle creation term. For\nthe bubble of nothing spacetime that we are considering in this section, this term is given by the expression\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(\n)\n2\u03c0j\n\u2032\n\u2032\nX\n\u2212i\n(\u03c7+\u03c7\n)\n\u2032\n\u2202R(r\n)\n\u03b2\nn \u2212n(\u03c8+\u03c8 )\n\u2206\u03c7\n2i\u03bd\nlim\nL\u22121+2h+ r2h+ R(r)\ne\ne\n(38)\nTn\u2217 (\u03c4 )Tn\u2217 (\u03c4 \u2032 )\n\u2032\nr\u2192\u221e,L\u2192\u221e\n\u2202r\n\u03b1\nn\nn,j\nThe r dependence in the above expression cancels out from the term in the braces which just yields 2h+ . Also, the\nsum over j gives a term proportional to \u03b4(\u03c7 + \u03c7\u2032 ). The summation over n is non-trivial to carry out explicitly and\nwe will not do so here.\nIV.\n\nTHE BUBBLING BOUNDARY\n\nAs another example we turn to the spacetime formed by replacing the flat part of the metric of AdS5 in Poincare\ncoordinates with the double analytically continued Schwarzschild bubble of nothing found in [22]. The metric is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr2 dr2\nr2 \u2212 2M r 2\nd\u03c12\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(39)\nd\u03c7 + r cosh \u03c4 d\u03b8 .\n+\nds = 2 + \u03c1 \u2212r d\u03c4 + 2\n\u03c1\nr \u2212 2M r\nr2\n\n\f7\nNote in this section we have changed notation slightly, \u03c1 (= 1/z) now represents the radial variable in the bulk, and\nr the radial variable on the boundary. The radial variable on the boundary, r, is restricted to r \u2265 2M . In order for\nthe spacetime to be regular at r = 2M we require \u03c7 to be periodic with period 8\u03c0M , as in the standard Euclidean\nblack hold background, while \u03b8 has the normal 2\u03c0 periodicity. This spacetime has a mild curvature singularity at the\nhorizon, due to the square of the Riemann tensor diverging there. This singularity is similar to the one found in the\nAdS-black string solution [26]. It has recently been debated whether an instability in the black string case leads to\na resolution of the singularity by the black string pinching off to form a cigar or pancake like shape [27, 28]. In our\ncase, the possible instability will be different, as our time and angular coordinates are different, hence the possible\nmode will not simply be an analytic continuation of the black string mode. In addition, because the space actually\nends at the bubble, proper boundary conditions must be imposed which will be different from the black string case.\nThe stability and endpoint of this background is an interesting problem in its own right. Here, we merely point it out\nsince our main interest is to use it as a simple example.\nThe scalar wave equation separates into a radial and a boundary part, and we begin by examining the latter, which\n \u0303\nis \u0003\u03c8(x\u0303)\n\u2212 k 2 \u03c8(x\u0303) = 0, where tildes refer to the boundary metric only. (The bulk radial equation will not play a role\nin the Bogolubov transformations.) In detail, this is\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2M\n1\n2M\n1\n1\n2\n\u2212 2\n\u2202r \u03c8 + 1 \u2212\n\u2202\u03c72 \u03c8 + 2\n\u2202\u03c4 (cosh \u03c4 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8) + 2 \u2202r r 1 \u2212\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03c8 \u2212 k 2 \u03c8 = 0.\nr cosh \u03c4\nr\nr\nr\nr cosh2 \u03c4\n\n(40)\n\nSince \u2202\u03c7 and \u2202\u03b8 are Killing vectors, we choose as our trial ansatz\n\u03c8(\u03c4, r, \u03c7, \u03b8) = T (\u03c4 )R(r) cos(n\u03c7/4M ) cos(l\u03b8),\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the arguments in the \u03c7 and \u03b8 parts are determined by their respective periodicity requirements, with n and l\ntaking integer values. Note also that we have chosen a basis of functions in these variables that are real (we could\njust as easily put in sine functions, or a linear combination of cosines and sines, our conclusions will be the same).\nWe are thus reduced to two separate ordinary differential equations\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\nd\ndT\nl2\n1\n2\nT = 0,\n(42)\ncosh \u03c4\n+ p +\ncosh \u03c4 d\u03c4\nd\u03c4\ncosh2 \u03c4\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0015\n2M dR\n2M\nn2\nd\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr 1\u2212\n+ \u2212r k + 1 \u2212\n+ p R = 0,\ndr\nr\ndr\nr\n16M 2\n\n(43)\n\nwhere \u2212p2 is a constant resulting from the separation of variables. We first focus on the radial equation. This equation\nis difficult to solve analytically, and is almost identical to the normal radial Schwarzschild equation (for a discussion\nof these see [29, 30, 31] and references therein). We only need that the decaying asymptotic for large r (r \u226b 2M ) is\ngiven by\np\nK\u03bd ( k 2 + n2 /16M 2 r)\n\u221a\nR\u2192\n, n, k 6= 0\n(44)\nr\nR \u2192 r\u22121/2\u00b1\u03bd ,\n\nn, k = 0.\n(45)\np\nwhere \u03bd = 1/4 \u2212 p2 . Fortunately, a detailed form of the radial solution is not necessary for computing the Bogolubov\ntransformations between in and out vacua.\nThe time dependent equation (42) is identical to (27) in Sec. III. Therefore, solving it in the same way we find\nTlin = coshl \u03c4 e(l+1/2\u2212i\u03bc)\u03c4 F (l + 1/2, l + 1/2 \u2212 i\u03bc; 1 \u2212 i\u03bc; \u2212e2\u03c4 ),\nl\n\nTlout\n\n\u2212(l+1/2+i\u03bc)\u03c4\n\n(46)\n\n\u22122\u03c4\n\n= cosh \u03c4 e\nF (l + 1/2, l + 1/2 + i\u03bc; 1 + i\u03bc; \u2212e\n),\n(47)\np\nwhere \u03bc = p2 \u2212 1/4. As before the asymptotics of these solutions make them good candidates for defining in and\nout vacua respectively. Then the Bogolubov transformation between the in and out vacua is Tlin = \u03b1l Tlout + \u03b2l Tlout\u2217\nwhere the coefficients are given by\n\u03b1l =\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 i\u03bc)\u0393(\u2212i\u03bc)\n,\n\u0393(1/2 \u2212 l \u2212 i\u03bc)\u0393(1/2 + l \u2212 i\u03bc)\n\n\u03b2l = \u2212i\n\n(\u22121)l\n.\nsinh(\u03c0\u03bc)\n\n(48)\n\n\f8\nSo the number of out particles in the in vacuum for the pln-th mode is given by\nhin|Npln |ini = |\u03b2l |2 =\n\n1\n.\nsinh (\u03c0\u03bc)\n2\n\n(49)\n\nBecause this is independent of the momentum quantum numbers there is an infinite amount of particle production.\n(Note that this does not agree with the geometric optics approximation in [22].)\nUsing (20) as in the previous section translates this bulk particle production due to cosmological expansion of the\nsolution into particle production in the dual field theory. Notice that k, which is the radial momentum eigenvalue\nin the AdS bulk acts as a \"mass\" as far as the boundary coordinates are concerned. Thus, the sum over AdS radial\nmomenta that appears in the expression for the total number of particles produced will be related in the CFT to a\nsum over different mass shells that will appear in the spectral decomposition of a large N collective field for the dual\noperator. (See [14] for related comments.)\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nWe have shown how to formulate the AdS/CFT correspondence when time dependence leads to multiple vacua and\nparticle production. Using this formulation we showed how two point correlators in the CFT can be computed in\nvarious vacua from the bulk point of view. We have also found a simple relation between particle production in the\nbulk and the boundary and illustrated these facts in examples. It is easy to extend our comments to higher point\ncorrelators. In general, the need to avoid poles in various ways will provide a role for real time thermal field theory. It\nwould be of interest to apply our analysis in settings that offer insights into the behavior of strongly coupled theories\nin time dependent backgrounds.\nAPPENDIX A: GREEN'S FUNCTION COMPUTATION\n\nThe computation of the propagator can be reduced to computing h0\u0304|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i. Using the definitions of the vacua\nand the mode expansions we have\nX\nh0\u0304|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i =\nh0\u0304|(\u0101k \u016bk (x) + h.c.)(ak\u2032 uk\u2032 (x) + h.c.)|0i\nk,k\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\nk,k\u2032\n\nh0\u0304|\u016bk (x)u\u2217k\u2032 (x\u2032 )\u0101k a\u2020k\u2032 |0i.\n\nUsing the Bogolubov transformations (6) we get\nX\nh0\u0304|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i =\n\u016bk (x)u\u2217k\u2032 (x\u2032 )h0\u0304|(\u03b1\u2217k ak \u2212 \u03b2k\u2217 a\u2020k )a\u2020k\u2032 |0i,\n\n(A1)\n\n(A2)\n\nk,k\u2032\n\nbut we can use the commutation relations, [ai , a\u2020j ] = \u03b4ij to compute the first term, and the relation (see [21] for the\nderivation) h0\u0304|a\u2020k a\u2020k\u2032 |0i = h0\u0304|0i\u03b2k\u2032 \u03b1\u22121\nk \u03b4kk\u2032 for the second term, which gives\n\u0010\nX\n|\u03b2k |2 \u0011\n.\n(A3)\nh0\u0304|a\u2020k a\u2020k\u2032 |0i = h0\u0304|0i\n\u016bk (x)u\u2217k (x\u2032 ) \u03b1\u2217k \u2212\n\u03b1k\nk\n\nPlugging this relation into the definition of the time-ordered propagator gives (11).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Jan de Boer, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Djordje Minic and Simon Ross for useful comments.
