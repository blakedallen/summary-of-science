ADL and IADL outcomes are considered essential\nin health services research and form a cornerstone of geriatric medicine. In\nthis article we present a Bayesian analysis of functional disability among\na sample of elderly individuals in the National Long Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS), using basic and extended Grade of Membership (GoM) models\nfor multivariate binary response data.\nThe NLTCS began in 1982 and now extends over six waves through 2004,\nmaking it an important source of information on possible changes in disability over time among the elderly Americans. The NLTCS data on functional\ndisability have been used to generate some major findings, such as a persistent decline in chronic disability among the elderly Americans [Manton and\nGu (1999) and Manton, Gu and Lamb (2006a, 2006b)].\nIt is common practice to analyze functional disability data by using totals\nwhere individual scores are added together for all items or by subsets [Manton and Gu (1999)]. Statistically, adherence to the Rasch model (1960) can\nprovide researchers with a formal justification for reducing the multivariate\ndata down to such total scores. It is often the case, however, that functional\ndisability data have a high amount of heterogeneity that is not explainable by the Rasch model. It may be possible to circumvent this problem by\nreducing the set of functional disability items under consideration, as was\nillustrated, for example, in the gerontology literature by Spector and Fleishman (1998). This approach, however, obviously ignores potentially relevant\ninformation contained in the excluded items.\nIn this paper we use individual-level mixtures to account for heterogeneity\nin functional disability data measured with a given battery of items without considering the issue of item reduction. We contrast the individual-level\nmixture assumption with population-level mixture models that assume individuals can be members of one and only one subpopulation, such as latent\nclass models [Goodman (1974), Lazarsfeld and Henry (1968)]. The central\nidea of all individual-level mixture models is to allow an individual's membership to be a mixture with respect to population components [Blei, Jordan\nand Ng (2003), Pritchard, Stephens and Donnelly (2000), Woodbury, Clive\nand Garson (1978)]. A natural example of individual-level mixtures is genetic makeup of individuals who have various degrees of ancestry in several\nsubpopulations of origin [Pritchard, Stephens and Donnelly (2000)]. Such\nadmixed individuals do not simply belong to one of the original subpopulations with some degree of uncertainty, but their genetic makeup is actually\ncomposed of genes that originated from different subpopulations. Specifically, we use the Grade of Membership (GoM) model introduced in 1978 by\nWoodbury, Clive and Garson (1978) and develop its extension to address\nthe following questions: How many mixture categories are in the functional\ndisability data under the assumption of mixed membership? What are characteristics of each mixture category? What is the population distribution of\nthe individual membership scores?\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n3\n\nWe begin by introducing the NLTCS in Section 2. Next, we describe the\nGoM model and its relationship to latent class models via the fundamental\nrepresentation theorem in Section 3. We use this result to develop a fully\nBayesian approach in Section 4.1, and describe a variational approximation approach as an alternative estimation method in Section 4.2. Section 5\ndevelops the extended mixture GoM model and corresponding estimation\ntechniques. Section 6 considers the question of dimensionality selection in\nterms of the optimal number of mixture categories. Section 7 describes results from simulation studies. Finally, we present an individual-level mixture\nanalysis of the NLTCS functional disability data and provide discussions in\nSections 8 and 9.\n2. National Long Term Care Survey functional disability data. The NLTCS\naims to assess chronic disability in the U.S. Medicare-enrolled population age\n65 or older [Corder and Manton (1991)]. The survey began in 1982 with a\nscreening survey instrument that selected community-dwelling chronically\ndisabled (based on basic and instrumental activities of daily living) persons\nfor detailed in-home interviews. Once individuals screened-in, the NLTCS\nfollowed them longitudinally. The second wave of the survey was in 1984,\nand all subsequent waves occurred in five-year intervals with the most recent wave completed in 2004. The NLTCS replenishes its sample at each\nwave in order to reflect the current U.S. population 65 and older. While\nadditional components have come and gone from post-1982 waves of the\nNLTCS, key disability questions have stayed the same. For more information on the NLTCS, see Corder and Manton (1991), Manton, Corder and\nStallard (1997), Singer and Manton (1998).\nWe consider an extract from the NLTCS that contains data on 6 activities of daily living (ADL) and 10 instrumental activities of daily living\n(IADL) for community-dwelling elderly from 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1994 survey waves. These 16 binary functional disability measures are described in\ndetail in Manton, Corder and Stallard (1993). The 6 ADL items include\nbasic activities of hygiene and personal care (eating, getting in/out of bed,\ngetting around inside, dressing, bathing, and getting to the bathroom or using toilet). The 10 IADL items include basic activities necessary to reside in\nthe community (doing heavy housework, doing light housework, doing laundry, cooking, grocery shopping, getting about outside, travelling, managing\nmoney, taking medicine and telephoning). Positive responses are coded as\n1 = disabled, and negative as 0 = healthy. In the NLTCS, positive ADL responses mean that during the past week the activity had not been, or was\nnot expected to be, performed without the aid of another person or the use\nof equipment; positive IADL responses mean that a person usually could\nnot, or was not going to be able to, perform the activity because of a disability of a health problem. For a more in-depth discussion, see Manton,\nCorder and Stallard (1993) and Erosheva and White (2006).\n\n\f4\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nAt each wave, the survey sample is representative of the 65 years and older\nU.S. population at that point in time. High follow-up rates and consistency\nin ADL and IADL questions over time make the NLTCS a unique source\nof data for studying complex questions such as the dynamics of population\nchanges in disability. Manton and Gu (1999) and Manton, Gu and Lamb\n(2006a, 2006b) used weighted total numbers of impaired ADL and IADL to\nshow declines in disability, but the important question of \"Why?\" [Cutler\n(2001)] still remains open. We believe that in order to move forward in\nour understanding of why disability is declining so rapidly and whether the\ndecline can be expected to continue, an important first step is to describe\nheterogeneous multivariate disability manifestations.\nOur ultimate goal is to develop a longitudinal version of the GoM model.\nOur analysis in this paper represents an attempt to learn disability mixture\nprofiles that describe the underlying structure of functional disability in the\nchronically disabled community-dwelling elderly U.S. population. We make\nthree simplifying assumptions in this analysis. First, we assume that the nature of the mixture components stays the same over time. For a longitudinal\nversion of the GoM model, keeping profiles the same over time and allowing the population distribution among the profiles to change would allow us\nto obtain an estimable model. For similar reasons, the assumption of timeinvariant latent classes is common in latent class transition modeling [see\nReboussin et al. (1998), e.g.]. In addition, our exploratory analysis where we\nanalyzed each wave separately using the GoM model, yielded profiles whose\ncharacteristics were fairly stable over time, thus confirming that the assumption of profile time-invariance is reasonable in our case. Second, we assume\nno inter-dependencies between longitudinal records on the same individuals.\nViolations of this assumption may affect efficiency of our estimates but will\nnot introduce bias. Third, we ignore the sample weights associated with differential probabilities of selection into the NLTCS. In fact, we have yet to\nunderstand how if at all we could incorporate the weights into the modeling\nprocess. We view these three assumptions necessary for this first step toward\nunderstanding changes in disability over time.\n3. The grade of membership (GoM) model and its latent class representation. The GoM model originate in the context of medical applications:\nwhen a diagnosis is uncertain, partial membership reflects this uncertainty\nthrough allowing different disease symptoms to correspond to different stages\nof the disease. GoM applications now cover a wide spectrum of studies,\nranging from studying depression [Davison et al. (1989)] and schizophrenia\n[Manton et al. (1994)] to analyzing complex genotype-phenotype relations\n[Manton et al. (2004)]; for a recent review, see Erosheva and Fienberg (2005).\nThe model remains relatively unfamiliar to statistical audiences, however.\nDespite a multitude of published large-scale GoM applications, there are few\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n5\n\nstatistical publications that explore basic GoM properties and demonstrate\nthe model's utility with similar examples [Erosheva (2005), Potthoff (2000),\nWachter (1999)].\nIn particular, the relationship between individual-level and populationlevel mixture models does not appear to be clearly formulated in the literature. Singer (1989) describes the GoM model as a new type of model that\nis not equivalent to usual mixture models. Likewise, when comparing the\nGoM and latent class models, in their 1994 book, Manton, Woodbury and\nTolley (1994) concluded: \"latent class model is nested in the GoM model\nstructure. . . ,\" but \". . . if we allow latent class model to have more classes,\nthen it is potentially possible to \"fit\" the realized data set as well as with\nGoM\" (page 45). On the other hand, Haberman (1995) in his review of Manton et al., suggested that the GoM model is a special case of latent class\nmodels. He pointed out that a set of constraints imposed upon a latent class\nmodel can specify a distribution of manifest variables that is identical to\nthat specified by the GoM model.\nIn this Section we describe the GoM and latent class models and present\nthe fundamental representation theorem of equivalence between individuallevel and population-level mixture models [Erosheva (2006)].\nGoM and latent class models. Let x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xJ ) be a vector of polytomous manifest variables, where xj takes on values lj \u2208 Lj = {1, 2, . . . , Lj },\nj = 1, 2, . . . , J , and Lj denotes the number of possible outcomes. Let X =\nQJ\nj=1 Lj be the set of all possible outcomes for vector x.\nTo define the GoM model, let K be the number of mixture components\n(extreme profiles), and let g = (g1 , g2 , . . . , gK ) be a latent partial membership\nvector of K nonnegative random variables that sum to 1. For discrete data,\neach extreme profile is characterized by a vector of conditional response\nprobabilities, when a given kth component of the partial membership vector\nis 1 and the others are 0:\n\u03bbkjlj = pr(xj = lj |gk = 1),\n(1)\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , K,\nj = 1, 2, . . . , J,\nlj = 1, 2, . . . , Lj .\n\nThe set of conditional response probabilities must satisfy the following constraints:\nX\n\n\u03bbkjlj = 1,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , K; j = 1, 2, . . . , J.\n\nlj \u2208Lj\n\nGiven partial membership vector g \u2208 [0, 1]K , the conditional distribution\nof manifest variable xj is given by a convex combination of the extreme\n\n\f6\n\nE.

Under this assumption, the\nconditional probability of observing response pattern l is\nf GoM (l|g) = pr(x = l|g)\n=\n\nJ\nY\n\npr(xj = lj |g) =\n\nj=1\n\nJ\nY\n\nK\nX\n\nj=1\n\n!\n\ngk \u03bbkjlj ,\n\nk=1\n\nl \u2208 X.\n\nThe local independence assumption is common in latent structure models\n[Lazarsfeld and Henry (1968)]; it says that latent variables fully account for\nassociations among the observed responses.\nLet us denote the distribution of g by D(g). Integrating out the latent\nvariable g, we obtain the marginal distribution for response pattern l in the\nform of an individual-level mixture\nf\n\nGoM\n\n(l) = pr(x = l) =\n\n(3)\n=\n\nZ Y\nJ\n\nj=1\n\nK\nX\n\nZ\n\nf GoM (l|g) dD(g)\n!\n\ngk \u03bbkjlj dD(g),\n\nk=1\n\nl \u2208 X.\n\nUsing similar notation, we can derive the K-class population-level mixture (latent class) model as a special case of the K-profile GoM model by\nrestricting components of the partial membership vector to only take values\n0 and 1. Denote the restricted version of the membership vector by g\u2217 and\nits probability mass function by \u03c0k = pr(gk\u2217 = 1). Assuming local independence, we see that the marginal distribution of the manifest variables under\nthe latent class model simplifies to the K-component summation:\nf\n\nLCM\n\n(l) = pr(x = l) =\n\n(4)\n=\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c0k\n\nJ\nY\n\nZ\n\nf LCM (l|g\u2217 ) dD(g\u2217 )\n\n\u03bbkjlj ,\n\nl \u2208 X.\n\nj=1\n\nThe probability of observing response pattern l is the sum of the probabilities\nof observing l from each of the latent classes, weighted by their relative sizes,\n\u03c0k . One can visualize the relationship between sets of individual-specific\nresponse probabilities under the GoM and latent class models with the same\nnumber of mixture categories using a geometric approach [Erosheva (2005)].\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n7\n\nFundamental representation theorem. Note that the GoM marginal or integrated likelihood in equation (3) does not simplify to a summation of K\ncomponents. This is in contrast to the functional form of the likelihood for a\npopulation-level mixture of K latent classes in equation (4). If we relax the\nrequirement of equality of the number of latent classes and extreme profiles,\nhowever, following Haberman (1995), we can construct a latent class model\nsuch that its marginal distribution of manifest variables is exactly the same\nas that under the GoM model.\nConsider a vector of J polytomous latent variables z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zJ ),\neach taking on values from the set of integers {1, 2, . . . , K}. Vector z here is\nthe latent classification variable. Denote\nby Z = {1, 2, . . . , K}J the set of all\nQJ\npossible vectors z. As before, X = j=1 Lj is the set of all possible outcomes\nfor vector x. Then X \u00d7 Z is the index set for the cross-classification of the\nmanifest variables x and latent classification variables z.\nTo obtain a latent class representation of the GoM model, we must find a\nway to interchange the summation and the product operator in equation (3).\nThe following lemma provides algebra which allows us to do so.\nLemma 3.1. For any two positive integers J and K, and for any two sets\nof real numbers {ak , k = 1, 2, . . . , K} and {bkj , k = 1, 2, . . . , K, j = 1, 2, . . . , J},\nJ X\nK\nY\n\nak bkj =\n\nj=1 k=1\n\nJ\nXY\n\nazj bzj j ,\n\nz\u2208Z j=1\n\nwhere z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zJ ) is such that z \u2208 Z =\n\nQJ\n\nj=1 {1, 2, . . . , K}.\n\nDefine the distribution over latent classes z \u2208 Z, conditional on the distribution of membership vector g \u2208 [0, 1]K :\n(5)\n\n\u03c0z = ED\n\nJ\nY\n\nj=1\n\n!\n\ngzj .\n\nIf (g1 , g2 , . . . , gK ) has a joint distribution D(g) on [0, 1]K , such that g1 + g2 +\n. . . + gK = 1, then \u03c0z is a probability measure on Z. From the functional\nform of \u03c0z , it also follows that latent classification variables z1 , z2 , . . . , zJ are\nexchangeable.\nTo specify the conditional distribution of the manifest variables given the\nlatent variables z, we need two additional assumptions. First, assume that\nxj depends only on the jth component of the latent indicator variable z:\n(6)\n\npr(xj = lj |z) = pr(xj = lj |z1 , z2 , . . . , zJ ) = pr(xj = lj |zj ),\n\nwhere zj \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , K}, and lj \u2208 {1, . . . , Lj } is the observed value of manifest variable xj . In essence, equation (6) postulates that manifest variable\n\n\f8\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nxj is directly influenced only by the jth component of the latent classification vector z. Second, assume that conditional response probabilities in\nequation (6) are given by\npr(xj = lj |zj ) = \u03bbzj jlj ,\n\nzj = 1, 2, . . . , K,\n\n(7)\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , J,\nlj = 1, 2, . . . , Lj ,\n\nwhere the set of \u03bbs is the same as the set of conditional response probabilities for the GoM model. These structural parameters must also satisfy the\nconstraints:\nLj\nX\n\n\u03bbzj jlj = 1,\n\nfor all z \u2208 Z, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , J}.\n\nlj =1\n\nUnder the local independence assumption, we obtain the probability of\nobserving response pattern l for the latent class model as\n\u2217\n\n(8)\n\nf (l) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c0z\n\nJ\nY\n\n!\n\n\u03bbzj jlj ,\n\nj=1\n\nz\u2208Z\n\nl \u2208 X,\n\nwhere the probability of latent class z is the\nQJ expected value of a J -fold product of the membership scores \u03c0z = ED ( j=1 gzj ). Thus, the probability of\nobserving response pattern l in equation (8) is the sum of the conditional\nprobabilities of observing l from each of the latent classes, weighted by the\nlatent class probabilities.\nConsider the marginal probability of an arbitrary response pattern l \u2208 X\nfor the GoM model provided by equation (3). Applying lemma 3.1 with ak =\ngk , bkj = \u03bbkjlj , and using properties of expectation, we obtain the marginal\nprobability:\nf\n\nGoM\n\n(l) =\n\nX\n\nz\u2208Z\n\n(\n\nED\n\nJ\nY\n\nj=1\n\ngzj\n\n!\n\nJ\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u03bbzj jlj\n\n!)\n\n,\n\nwhich is exactly the same as in equation (8). It follows that the GoM model\nis equivalent to a latent class model with a distribution on the latent classes\ngiven by a functional form of the distribution of membership scores. This\nequivalence statement can be generalized via the following fundamental representation theorem:\nTheorem 3.2. Given J manifest variables, any individual-level mixture\nmodel with K components can be represented as a constrained populationlevel mixture model with K J components.\nThe fundamental representation theorem applies to a wider class of mixed\nmembership models introduced by Erosheva (2002).\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n9\n\n4. Estimation algorithms for the standard GoM model.\n4.1. Bayesian estimation algorithm.\nData augmentation. The fundamental representation theorem leads us naturally to a data augmentation approach in the spirit of those described by\nTanner (1996). In this Section we present the Bayesian estimation algorithm\nfor the GoM model, described earlier in Erosheva (2003).\nDenote by x the set of observed responses xij for all subjects. Denote\nby \u03bb the set of conditional response probabilities. For the functional disability data, \u03bbkj = pr(xj = 1|gk = 1) is the probability of being disabled on\nactivity j for a complete member of extreme profile k. For subject i, augment observed responses with realizations of the latent classification variables zi = (zi1 , . . . , ziJ ). Denote by z the set of latent classifications zij on\nall items for all individuals. In the following, we use notation p(*) to refer to\nboth probability density and probability mass functions.\nWe assume the distribution of membership scores is Dirichlet with parameters \u03b1. The joint probability model for the parameters and augmented\ndata is\np(x, z, g, \u03bb, \u03b1) = p(\u03bb, \u03b1) * p(x, z, g|\u03bb, \u03b1)\n= p(\u03bb, \u03b1)\n\nN\nY\n\n[p(zi |gi )p(xi |\u03bb, zi ) * D(gi |\u03b1)],\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\np(zi |gi ) =\n\nJ Y\nK\nY\n\ngikijk ,\n\nJ Y\nK\nY\n\n(\u03bbkjij (1 \u2212 \u03bbkj )1\u2212xij )zijk ,\n\nz\n\nj=1 k=1\n\np(xi |\u03bb, zi ) =\n\nx\n\nj=1 k=1\n\nP\n\n\u0393( k \u03b1k )\n\u03b1K \u22121\ng\u03b11 \u22121 * * * giK\n,\nDir (gi |\u03b1) =\n\u0393(\u03b11 ) * * * \u0393(\u03b1K ) i1\nand latent classification indicators zijk are such that zijk = 1, if zij = k, and\nzijk = 0 otherwise.\nWe assume the prior on extreme profile response probabilities \u03bb is independent of the prior on the hyperparameters \u03b1. We further assume that the\nprior distribution of extreme profile response probabilities treats items and\nextreme profiles as independent. Thus,\n(9)\n\np(\u03bb, \u03b1) = p(\u03b1)\n\nK Y\nJ\nY\n\nk=1 j=1\n\np(\u03bbkj ).\n\n\f10\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nWe take p(\u03bbkj ) to be Beta(\u03b71 , \u03b72 ), and, for simplicity, in what follows we\nuse \u03b71 = \u03b72 = 1.\nIf the hyperparameters \u03b1 are known, it is possible to obtain complete\nconditional distributions and use standard software such as BUGS1 to obtain\na posterior distribution of the model parameters [Erosheva (2002)]. In reality,\nthe hyperparameters are unlikely to be known and need to be estimated.\nSetting hyperparameters to some fixed values without prior knowledge may\nbias conclusions and affect model choice in individual-level mixture models\n[see the discussion in Airoldi et al. (2007)].\nIf we assume that the Dirichlet parameter vector \u03b1 is unknown, we obtain\nsamples from its posterior distribution via a Metropolis\u2013Hastings step within\nthe Gibbs sampler. Consider a reparameterization of \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1K ) with\nP\n\u03b10 = K\nk=1 \u03b1k and \u03be = (\u03be1 , . . . , \u03beK ), where \u03bek = \u03b1k /\u03b10 . Then components of\nvector \u03be reflect proportions of the item responses that belong to each mixture category, and \u03b10 reflects the spread of the membership distribution. The\ncloser \u03b10 is to zero, the more probability is concentrated near the mixture\ncategories; similarly, the larger \u03b10 is, the more probability is concentrated\nnear the population average membership score.\nWe assume that \u03b10 and \u03be are independent since they govern two unrelated\nqualities of the distribution of the GoM scores. We also assume that the\nprior distribution on the GoM scores is independent of the prior distribution\non the structural parameters.

Extended GoM mixture and its estimation. Although there is no time\ndimension in the basic GoM model, the latent class representation essentially describes individuals as stochastic \"movers.\" Here, individuals may\nmove between extreme profiles when they respond to different items on the\nquestionnaire. With this observation, it is natural to extend the GoM model\nto incorporate potential \"stayers,\" or those individuals that provide item\nresponses in a deterministic fashion, analogous to longitudinal mover-stayer\nmodels [Blumen, Kogan and Holland (1955)]. In the extended GoM mixture\nmodel, one compartment represents \"movers\" determined by the GoM part\nand other compartments represent different kinds of \"stayers\" determined\nby specific extreme profiles or by particular cells in the contingency table.\nThe extended GoM model can also be seen as a combination of latent class\nand GoM mixture modeling analogous to the extended finite mixture model\nby Muthen and Shedden (1999).\nFor our analysis in this paper, we introduce one compartment of \"stayers\" for a specific cell in the table, and leave the question of choosing\nthe number and nature of compartments open. Our choice of the \"stayers\" cell was motivated by two observations. First, in the functional disability data from the NLTCS, the cell that corresponds to the healthy\npeople who report no disabilities is particularly difficult to fit with the\nstandard GoM model. Thus, the excess of healthy people can be thought\nof as a set of outliers with respect to the standard GoM model. Second,\nit is known that elderly people move not only from being healthy to being disabled but also from being disabled to being healthy [Gill, Hardy\nand Williams (2002), Gill and Kurland (2003), Lynch, Brown and Harmsen (2003), Manton (1988)]. Therefore, even though the NLTCS participants are initially screened for chronic disability, it is reasonable to assume\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n15\n\nthe presence of healthy \"stayers\" in the data. Accordingly, we assume that\nsome proportion of people has zero probability to report a functional activity problem at the time of the survey and that everyone else has nonzero\nchances to report a functional disability problem according to the basic\nGoM model. Our specific example of extended GoM mixture model can\nalso be thought of as analogous to zero-inflated Poisson regression [Lambert\n(1992)].\nParameter estimation for the compartmental GoM model would be identical to the estimation for the standard GoM model if we knew how many\nindividuals are healthy \"stayers.\" Given that the number of healthy \"stayers\" is not observed, we need to modify parameter estimation taking into\naccount a deterministic component.\nMore formally, we assume existence of: (1) a deterministic compartment\nof healthy individuals and (2) a stochastic GoM compartment. We denote by\n\u03b8 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) the respective weights such that \u03b81 + \u03b82 = 1. Assume individuals\nin the healthy compartment have no disabilities with probability 1. The\ndistribution of responses for \"movers\" is given by the GoM model with\nparameters \u03b1, \u03bb.\nWe further augment the data with compartmental indicators to derive the\nfollowing modifications for the MCMC sampling algorithm. Let N be the\n(m)\ntotal number of individuals in the sample and n2 be the expected value\nof the all-zero cell count for the GoM compartment at the mth iteration.\nThe expected value of the all-zero cell count from the healthy compartment,\n(m)\n(m)\nn1 , can be obtained by subtracting n2 from the observed all-zero cell\ncount. Denote the number of individuals with at least one positive and at\nleast one zero response in their response pattern by nmix . The total number\nof individuals from the GoM compartment at the mth iteration is then\n(m)\nn2 + nmix . We let the prior distribution for compartmental weights \u03b8 be\nuniform on the simplex, and update \u03b8 at the end of the posterior step with\n(21)\n\n(m+1)\n\n\u03b81\n\n(m)\n\n= \u03b81\n\n(m)\n\n+\n\nn2\n\n(m+1)\n\n\u2212 n2\nN\n\n,\n\n(m+1)\n\n+ nmix\n(m+1)\n= 1 \u2212 \u03b81\n.\nN\nWe can easily generalize the algorithm to more than two compartments.\n(22)\n\n(m+1)\n\u03b82\n\n=\n\nn2\n\n6. Model selection: Choice of dimensionality.\nChoice of dimensionality: Overview. Statistical model selection methods\ninclude the Pearson's chi-square goodness of fit test [Pearson (1900)], crossvalidation techniques [Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2001)], penalized\nlikelihood criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [Akaike\n\n\f16\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\n(1973)], the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [Pelleg and Moore (2000),\nSchwartz (1978)] and Bayes factors [Kass and Raftery (1995)], reversible\njump MCMC techniques [Green (1995)], deviance information criteria (DIC)\n[Spiegelhalter et al. (2002)] and more recent simulation-based analogues to\nAIC and BIC, called Akaike Information Criterion Monte Carlo (AICM) and\nBayesian Information Criterion Monte Carlo (BICM) [Raftery et al. (2007)],\namong others.\nSome of these criteria, AIC and BIC in particular, have been criticized\nas being not applicable for assessing the number of mixture components\ndue to violations of the regularity conditions [McLachlan and Peel (2000)].\nHowever, in spite of this, researchers continue to apply both criteria and\nto study their performance in a mixture context. Findings in populationlevel mixture models suggest that AIC tends to overestimate the correct\nnumber of components [Celeux and Soromenho (1996)], while BIC shows\nbetter results [Leroux (1992), Roeder and Wasserman (1997)].\nQuestions of dimensionality choice in mixed membership or individuallevel mixture models have been approached by several authors [Airoldi et al.\n(2007), Blei, Ng and Jordan (2001), Erosheva (2002), Griffiths and Steyvers\n(2004), Pritchard, Stephens and Donnelly (2000)]. With one recent exception [Airoldi et al. (2007)], however, comparative performances of different\nselection criteria were not examined. Here, we provide an overview of several\ncomputationally feasible criteria and present results from a simulation study\nwhere we compare their performance in the context of the GoM model.\nModel selection criteria: Overview. The Pearson chi-square test is one of\nthe most common goodness-of-fit tests. It is not easily applicable to large\nsparse tables because of a large number of very small counts and, in the\npresent context, because of the way in which the estimation is done, even if\nsparseness wasn't a problem, it wouldn't follow the usual chi-square distribution. We find it instructive, nonetheless, to examine deviations between\nexpected and observed counts for cells with large observed values via the\nsum of squared Pearson residuals, see Bishop, Fienberg and Holland (1975).\nWe refer to this criterion as the truncated sum of squared Pearson residuals\n(SSPR) criterion or \u03c72tr .\nTo calculate the truncated SSPR criterion, one needs to obtain expected\nvalues for selected response patterns r = (r1 , . . . , rJ ), where rj = 0 or 1.\n(s)\n(s)\nFor example, using draws from the posterior distribution, \u03b1k and \u03bbkj ,\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\ns = 1, . . . , S, and a draw g(s) = (g1 , . . . , gK ) from Dir (\u03b1(s) ), the expected\ncount for response pattern r can be computed as\nExpected Count =\n\nK\nS Y\nJ\nX\n1X\n(s)\n(s) (s)\ngk (\u03bbkj )rj (1 \u2212 \u03bbkj )1\u2212rj\nS s=1 j=1 k=1\n\n!!\n\n\u00d7 N.\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n17\n\nNote that label switching could present a problem for calculating posterior\nmeans and the model selection criteria based on them [Stephens (2000)].\nFor the variational approximation, the expected count for response pattern r can be obtained as follows. Let \u03b1\u0302 and \u03bb\u0302 be the pseudo MLE obtained via variational approximation and let g(s) , s = 1, . . . , S, be draws\nfrom Dir (\u03b1\u0302), for some large S (e.g., S = 5000). Then, the expected count\nfor response pattern r can be computed as above but with \u03bb\u0302kj in place of\n(s)\n(s)\n\u03bbkj and with gk computed using Dir (\u03b1\u0302).\nA general formulation of the BIC is based on the log-likelihood l(x; \u03b8)\nand a maximum likelihood estimate \u03b8\u0302:\nBIC = \u22122l(x; \u03b8\u0302) + p log(N ),\nwhere p is the number of free parameters in the model and N is the number\nof data points. To obtain the BIC for the GoM model, we need to evaluate\nthe integrated log-likelihood l(x; \u03b8) at the maximum likelihood estimate of\nthe parameter vector \u03b8 = (\u03bb, \u03b1). Since the GoM integrated likelihood is intractable, we use variational methods described in Section 4.1 to obtain an\napproximation to the BIC:\ng = \u22122l\u0303(x; \u03bb\u0302, \u03b1\u0302) + p log(N ),\nBIC\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0302 and \u03b1\u0302 are the (pseudo) maximum likelihood estimates obtained\nvia variational approximation and l\u0303(x; \u03bb\u0302, \u03b1\u0302) is the lower bound on the logg are preferable.\nlikelihood. Models with larger values of BIC\nBayesian measures of model complexity and fit, namely, DIC, AICM,\nand BICM, are analogous to AIC and BIC but are based solely on posterior\nsimulation. While these criteria are attractive because of their computational\nsimplicity for a given MCMC simulation, they may present other challenges\nsuch as choice of the parameters in focus [Spiegelhalter et al. (2002)].\nA general formulation of DIC is based on the concepts of Bayesian deviance and the effective number of parameters. Bayesian deviance is defined\nas\nD(\u03b8) = \u22122l(\u03b8) + 2 log(h(x)),\nwhere l(\u03b8) = log p(x|\u03b8) and h(x) is a function of the data only. Defining the\neffective number of parameters as\npD = D(\u03b8) \u2212 D(\u03b8),\nwe compute DIC as follows:\nDIC = D(\u03b8) + 2pD .\n\n\f18\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nIf we focus on GoM parameters \u03b8 = (g, \u03bb), we can compute a version of\n(s)\n(s)\nDIC directly using S draws from the posterior distribution, gik and \u03bbkj ,\ns = 1, . . . , S. The two pieces that we need to compute for DIC are\nD(g, \u03bb) = \u22122\n\nN X\nJ\nX\n\nlog\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere gik =\n\n1\nS\n\nPS\n\n(s)\ns=1 gik ,\n\nand \u03bbkj =\n\nK\nX\n\ngik \u03bbkj\n\nxij\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bbkj )\n\nk=1\n1\nS\n\nPS\n\n(s)\ns=1 \u03bbkj ,\n\n1\u2212xij\n\n!\n\n,\n\nand,\n!\n\nK\nS X\nN X\nJ\nX\n1X\n(s)\n(s) (s)\nD(g, \u03bb) = \u22122\ngik (\u03bbkj )xij (1 \u2212 \u03bbkj )1\u2212xij .\nlog\nS s=1 i=1 j=1\nk=1\n\nModels with smaller values of DIC are preferable.\nAICM is a penalized version of the posterior mean of the log-likelihoods\nAICM = 2(l(\u03b8) \u2212 s2l(\u03b8) ),\nthat can be obtained using only the draws from the posterior simulation\n[Raftery et al. (2007)]. For the GoM model, the two pieces we need to compute are\nS\nS\n1X\n1X\n(s)\n2\nl(\u03b8) =\nl(\u03b8 ) and sl =\n(l(\u03b8 (s) ) \u2212 l(\u03b8))2 ,\nS s=1\nS s=1\n\nwhere \u03b8 = (g, \u03bb). Notice that l(\u03b8) = \u2212D(\u03b8)/2.\n7. Simulation study. We conducted a simulation study to investigate\nperformance of the MCMC and variational approximation methods with\nrespect to parameter recovery and dimensionality selection. Here, we briefly\nreport main findings from this study.\nWe selected data generating designs to reflect several important features of\nfunctional disability data. Most noticeably, contingency tables on disability\ndata often have a large number of zero or very small observed cell counts\nand several very large cell counts. Large cell counts typically include the\nall-zero and the all-one response patterns.\nWe considered 3- and 7-profile data generation scenarios. In the first scenario, we generated 5,000 individual responses on 16 binary items using\nthe GoM model with K \u2217 = 3 extreme profiles. We chose the profiles to be\nconsidered as \"healthy,\" \"disabled\" and \"intermediate\" by their conditional\nresponse probabilities. Respective proportions of the profiles were 0.7, 0.2\nand 0.1, and the hyperparameter was set at \u03b10 = 0.25 to reflect the fact\nthat individual responses to most items come from one extreme profile.\nIn the second scenario, we generated 5,000 individual responses to 10\nbinary items using the GoM model with 7 extreme profiles. We chose conditional response probabilities for 4 profiles so that they could be considered\n\n\f19\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\nTable 1\nChoices of optimal K according to different model selection criteria\nCriterion\n\nMethod\n\nK\u2217 = 3\n\nK\u2217 = 7\n\n\u03c72tr\n\u03c72tr\nBIC\nDIC\nAICM\nBICM\n\nVA\nMCMC\nVA\nMCMC\nMCMC\nMCMC\n\n3\n5\n2\n5\n3\n2\n\n7\n7\n7\n9\n7\n5\n\nas \"very healthy,\" \"healthy,\" \"disabled\" and \"very disabled.\" The other 3\nintermediate profiles did not follow the ordering. Profile proportions ranged\nfrom 0.05 for one of the intermediate profiles to 0.4 for the \"healthy\" profile,\nand the hyperparameter was set at \u03b10 = 0.2.\nUnder both scenarios, we carried out parameter estimation using the\nMCMC and variational approximation methods for the true values of K \u2217 .\nThe variational methods consistently provided better estimation for the observed count at the all-zero pattern, however, the MCMC approach yielded\nan overall better fit for the second scenario with K \u2217 = 7. For K \u2217 = 3, conditional probabilities for the \"healthy\" and \"disabled\" profiles were recovered very well with both estimation methods. For the intermediate profile,\nthe variational approximation consistently overestimated and the MCMC\nconsistently underestimated the conditional response probabilities. Parameter recovery was noticeably better for K \u2217 = 3 than for K \u2217 = 7. This could\nindicate that the number of items and the sample size in the second scenario were too small to provide reliable distinction among different grades\nof membership, given the selected extreme profiles and hyperparameter values. Variational estimates of the profiles' proportions were closer to the true\nvalues than corresponding MCMC estimates under both scenarios. In addition, the MCMC estimates of profile proportions had smaller range than the\nVA estimates.\nFor the MCMC method, given a sufficiently long run, the starting values of\n\u03bb did not seem to influence the results, up to a relabeling of the extreme profiles. For smaller values of K, the posterior means obtained through MCMC\nsimulations were very similar for all starting points considered. For this reason we did not use several starting points in higher dimensional cases that\nwould have required substantial increases of computing time.\nTo investigate performance of different fit indices, we fitted the generated\ndata sets using both the MCMC and variational methods separately for\nseveral values of K. For true K \u2217 = 3, models fitted with K = 2, 3, 4, 5 were\nconsidered; for true K \u2217 = 7, models fitted with K = 5, 7, 9 were considered.\nTable 1 summarizes results of six goodness-of-fit criteria, two of which rely\n\n\f20\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\non the variational approximation method, while the rest rely on the full\nMCMC calculations. The values of \u03c72tr were calculated for response patterns\nwith observed counts \u2265 30 in the first case and \u2265 40 in the second case.\nWe see that \u03c72tr obtained with the variational method and AICM criteria\nperform well for both data generating scenarios, while BICM underestimates\nand DIC overestimates the true number of profiles in both cases. The variational approximation to BIC underestimates the model complexity for the\n3-profile case, while it points to the true optimal number of profiles in the\n7-profile case.\n8. Analysis of the NLTCS functional disability data. Data on 16 binary\nADL and IADL items, pooled across four survey waves, 1982, 1984, 1989\nand 1994, form a 216 contingency table.2 The total sample size is 21,574.\nItem marginal frequencies range from 0.1 for difficulty with eating to 0.7 for\ndoing heavy housework. About 80% of cells in the contingency table have\nobserved counts that are less than 5; 24 cells have observed counts greater\nthan 100. These 24 most frequent response patterns account for 42% of the\ntotal observations (Table 2).\nFrom an interpretative standpoint, it is often desirable to have data that\nsatisfy latent unidimensionality, as in the well-known Rasch model. We formally tested the hypothesis of latent unidimensionality, following the approach of Holland and Rosenbaum (1986), using series of Mantel\u2013Haenszel\ntests to detect negative conditional association among the 16 variables. We\nconcluded that no monotone unidimensional latent structure model (e.g.,\none-factor or unidimensional logistic item response models) can provide an\nacceptable fit for the NLTCS data on 16 ADL/IADL items. Having rejected\nlatent unidimensionality, our next step is to use the GoM analysis to determine characteristics and the number of disability profiles in the data.\nThe most apparent feature of the data is the very large observed count of\n\"healthy\" people. Almost 18% report no disabilities (Table 2), despite the\nfact that the majority of the NLTCS survey participants had been screenedin earlier as chronically disabled. A large fraction of \"healthy\" respondents\nincludes disability recoveries, as well as survey supplements of the healthy\nand oldest-old in the 1994 wave. Since most of the \"healthy\" individuals\nhave been identified earlier as chronically disabled, it is important to incorporate these responses in our model. We use the compartmental GoM model\nto estimate weights of deterministically healthy and partially disabled components. In doing so, we allow the extended GoM model to fit the observed\ncount for the all-zero pattern. In addition, we examine the impact of the\nintroduction of the \"healthy\" compartment on parameter estimates and on\nmodel choice.\n2\nThe full table is available for downloading from STATLIB at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/\nunder the label NLTCS.\n\n\fTable 2\nExpected cell counts for 24 most frequent response patterns under the basic GoM model with K profiles\nNumber of latent profiles K\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nResponse pattern\n0000000000\n0100000000\n0001000000\n0101000000\n0001000100\n0000000010\n0000000010\n0001000010\n0001000010\n0101000010\n0101000010\n0100000001\n0001000001\n0001000101\n0001000011\n0001000111\n0001000111\n0101000111\n1111111111\n1111111111\n1111111111\n1111111111\n1111111111\n1111111111\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\nObserved\n3853\n216\n1107\n188\n122\n351\n206\n303\n182\n108\n106\n195\n198\n196\n123\n176\n120\n101\n102\n107\n104\n164\n153\n660\n\n3\n2569\n225\n1135\n116\n64\n344\n20\n200\n44\n51\n32\n219\n127\n41\n96\n136\n144\n127\n44\n88\n269\n214\n291\n233\n\n4\n2055\n172\n710\n76\n88\n245\n23\n126\n71\n39\n94\n101\n111\n172\n86\n162\n104\n90\n38\n104\n239\n246\n261\n270\n\n5\n2801\n177\n912\n113\n58\n250\n116\n324\n170\n162\n94\n160\n108\n90\n132\n97\n41\n54\n22\n96\n202\n272\n266\n362\n\n6\n2889\n186\n993\n200\n199\n274\n86\n255\n169\n105\n123\n46\n341\n104\n131\n67\n57\n41\n18\n84\n52\n274\n250\n419\n\n7\n3093\n180\n914\n199\n90\n274\n80\n236\n162\n85\n125\n25\n170\n224\n120\n167\n47\n68\n18\n87\n50\n276\n230\n418\n\n8\n2941\n180\n937\n181\n89\n259\n137\n213\n200\n117\n133\n24\n169\n214\n109\n149\n96\n72\n85\n43\n50\n224\n235\n582\n\n9\n3269\n202\n1010\n190\n116\n331\n116\n273\n172\n97\n142\n25\n189\n174\n95\n152\n75\n70\n103\n37\n63\n166\n189\n612\n\n10\n3016\n205\n944\n198\n127\n303\n111\n264\n187\n108\n157\n31\n200\n187\n108\n167\n72\n74\n85\n31\n53\n143\n167\n474\n\n15\n3031\n187\n940\n201\n127\n357\n149\n325\n219\n116\n136\n27\n163\n160\n110\n157\n80\n124\n61\n73\n66\n115\n137\n423\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\nn\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\n21\n\n\f22\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\n8.1. GoM analysis.\nMCMC sampling. We applied the fully Bayesian approach from Section 4\nto estimate the posterior distribution of the GoM model parameters with the\nnumber of extreme profiles ranging from K = 3 to K = 15. Extreme profiles\nfor K = 2 were identified as \"healthy\" and \"disabled,\" making the K =\n2 GoM model a monotone unidimensional latent structure model. Having\nrejected latent unidimensionality earlier, we only considered results for K =\n3 and beyond in the rest of our analysis.\nWe expected individual vectors of membership scores to be dominated by\none component, hence, we set the prior for \u03b10 to be Gamma(2, 10). We chose\nthe prior for the relative proportions \u03be to be uniform on the simplex and\nput uniform independent priors on the conditional response probabilities \u03bb.\nWe fit the models sequentially in the order of K. For the GoM model with\nK extreme profiles, we set starting values for \u03bb to the estimated conditional\nresponse probabilities from the latent class model with K classes. We took\nthe posterior mean of \u03b10 from the GoM model with K \u2212 1 extreme profiles\nto be the starting value for \u03b10 for the GoM model with K extreme profiles.\nWe chose starting values for the hyperparameters \u03be to be equal to the latent\nclass weights estimated from the K class model.\nFor each value of K, we adjusted the tuning parameters \u03c9 (for \u03b10 )\nand \u03b4 (for \u03be) to reach a compromise between the acceptance rates of the\nMetropolis\u2013Hastings steps and the amount of mixing. The acceptance rates\nfor \u03b10 and \u03be varied respectively from 11% and 28% in lower dimensions to\n5% and 9% in higher dimensions. Since the acceptance rates were low, we\nintroduced thinning parameter q and kept every qth draw and discarded the\nrest; q varied from 10 in lower dimensions to 140 in higher dimensions.\nChoosing the length of a burn-in period did not appear to be a problem\nwith our data. The chains generally did not experience long burn-in periods,\nexcept when starting values for the hyperparameters were very far from the\nposterior means. The burn-in period varied from 10,000 iterations in lower\ndimensions to 60,000 in higher dimensions.\nFor each parameter, we monitored univariate convergence via Geweke\ndiagnostics, and Heidelberger and Welch stationarity and interval halfwidth\ntests, available from the CODA package [Best, Cowles and Vines (1996)].\nIn addition, we visually examined plots of successive iterations. To assess\nconvergence of the multivariate posterior, we examined successive values of\nthe log-likelihood with the same set of methods. The chains needed far fewer\niterations to converge in posterior means than they needed to converge in\ndistribution for all parameters and the log-likelihood.\nWe ran all chains long enough to reach acceptable convergence levels. We\nhad to consider larger number of iterations for higher values of K to accommodate slow convergence of the hyperparameters due to slow mixing of the\n\n\f23\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\nTable 3\nTruncated sum of squared Pearson residuals, \u03c72tr , for the basic GoM model with K\nprofiles, with different levels of truncation\nNumber of latent profiles K\nLevel\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u2265100\n\u226525\n\u226510\n\n4889\n14562\n52288\n\n5032\n10458\n20625\n\n1840\n6153\n10839\n\n2202\n4337\n7766\n\n2458\n3566\n6251\n\n1908\n2194\n4534\n\n1582\n1803\n3931\n\n1602\n1997\n4276\n\n1604\n1946\n4258\n\nchains. The additional iterations needed to satisfy convergence criteria for\nhyperparameters (after the other parameters have reached convergence) had\nnegligible effect on the posterior means of the conditional response probabilities.\nModel selection. Table 2 provides 24 response patterns with observed cell\ncounts \u2265 100 and corresponding expected counts obtained using draws from\nthe posterior distribution for each K = 3, . . . , 9, 10, 15. We observe that the\nmodel with K = 9 replicated the marginal pattern abundance best. It is\nespecially evident that models with K = 10 and K = 15 did not fit the three\nlargest cell counts as well as the 9-profile model.\nTo select the number of profiles, we used all of the criteria that performed\nwell in our simulation study described in Section 6 (the truncated SSPR\ncriterion, the variational approximation to the BIC, and the AICM). We\nalso calculated DIC for a further comparison, although it overestimated the\ncorrect number of profiles in the simulation study.\nTable 3 gives values of the truncated SSPR criterion, \u03c72tr , for three different levels of truncation, over cells with observed counts \u2265 100, 25 and 10. All\nthree criteria indicate that the K = 9 model has a better fit in an absolute\nsense, that is, without correcting for differences in the degrees of freedom.\nFigure 1 shows plots of the DIC, the BIC approximation, the AICM and\nthe truncated SSPR criterion for the 100 level of truncation. All criteria\nagree that the optimal number of profiles is greater than 7. Recall that in\nthe 7-profile simulation study the AICM, the BIC approximation, and the\ntruncated SSPR criterion all obtained the correct number of components.\nFor the NLTCS data, these criteria point to 7, 10 and 9 profiles, respectively. Although the DIC overestimated the correct number of profiles in\nour simulation study, it indicates that 9 profiles is the optimal number for\nthe NLTCS functional disability data. The value of K = 9 is in agreement\nwith the results from truncated SSPR, but is less than the optimal choice\nof K = 10 identified by BIC.\nWe used the following steps to verify that no label switching had occurred\nin the MCMC chains. First, we postulated that label switching occasions\n\n\f24\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nshould be visible as jumps in trace plots of the MCMC iterations when\nthe extreme profiles are well separated in the multidimensional space. We\nfound extreme profiles to be well separated in the multidimensional space\nfor all K < 9. That is, there was at least one item for which posterior means\nwere at least two standard deviations away from each other for each pair of\nthe profiles (Table 4). We then visually monitored chains to identify jumps\nthat could correspond to label permutations in the posterior distribution.\nWe observed no jumps for models with K < 9 and concluded that no label\nswitching occurred in those chains.\nWe weren't able to carry out analogous assessments for the GoM models\nwith K = 9 and higher since the profiles were no longer well separated (compare, e.g., profiles k = 1 and 8 in Table 4.3 ) It is possible that label-switching\ndid occur in those cases which would question validity of posterior mean estimates and the use of DIC and AICM. However, given that the approximate\nBIC, which is not impacted by label switching, indicated K \u2217 = 10, a choice\nof an optimal K around that value seems reasonable.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nGoodness-of-fit criteria for the basic GoM model.\n\n3\nStandard deviation estimates are provided as part of supplemental material available\nat http://imstat.org/aoas/supplements.\n\n\f25\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\nTable 4\nPosterior mean estimates for the basic GoM model with 9 profiles\nExtreme profile number (k)\n\n\u03bb\u0302k,1\n\u03bb\u0302k,2\n\u03bb\u0302k,3\n\u03bb\u0302k,4\n\u03bb\u0302k,5\n\u03bb\u0302k,6\n\u03bb\u0302k,7\n\u03bb\u0302k,8\n\u03bb\u0302k,9\n\u03bb\u0302k,10\n\u03bb\u0302k,11\n\u03bb\u0302k,12\n\u03bb\u0302k,13\n\u03bb\u0302k,14\n\u03bb\u0302k,15\n\u03bb\u0302k,16\n\u03be\u0302k\n\u03b1\u03020\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0.001\n0.001\n0.001\n0.009\n0.070\n0.011\n0.008\n< 0.001\n0.001\n0.001\n0.002\n0.042\n0.037\n0.012\n0.022\n0.024\n0.095\n0.095\n\n0.035\n0.071\n0.285\n0.158\n0.550\n0.114\n0.985\n0.524\n0.909\n0.822\n0.977\n0.692\n0.836\n0.626\n0.489\n0.386\n0.107\n\n0.002\n0.003\n0.001\n0.029\n0.171\n0.026\n0.973\n0.019\n0.093\n0.014\n0.080\n0.146\n0.109\n0.013\n0.055\n0.021\n0.111\n\n0.005\n0.269\n0.706\n0.076\n0.453\n0.208\n0.607\n0.005\n0.034\n0.001\n0.077\n0.933\n0.219\n0.002\n0.029\n0.007\n0.114\n\n0.239\n0.891\n0.994\n0.674\n0.974\n0.774\n0.999\n0.669\n0.864\n0.694\n0.920\n0.950\n0.838\n0.230\n0.345\n0.061\n0.115\n\n0.002\n0.437\n0.875\n0.080\n0.627\n0.317\n0.948\n0.034\n0.412\n0.067\n0.856\n0.998\n0.847\n0.144\n0.068\n0.027\n0.114\n\n0.738\n0.967\n0.976\n0.970\n0.998\n0.894\n0.999\n0.955\n0.997\n0.998\n0.995\n0.936\n0.894\n0.908\n0.909\n0.768\n0.114\n\n0.001\n0.001\n0.001\n0.004\n0.039\n0.005\n0.007\n< 0.001\n0.001\n0.001\n0.002\n0.076\n0.037\n0.007\n0.010\n0.017\n0.114\n\n0.002\n0.001\n0.004\n0.013\n0.266\n0.026\n0.761\n0.011\n0.208\n0.055\n0.752\n0.448\n0.849\n0.282\n0.127\n0.099\n0.114\n\nADL items: (1) eating, (2) getting in/out of bed, (3) getting around inside, (4) dressing,\n(5) bathing, (6) using toilet.

Therefore, we report the estimated profiles for the 9-profile GoM model that is\nidentified as the optimal by truncated SSPR criteria. Table 4 provides posterior means and standard deviations for the conditional response probabilities, \u03bbkj = pr(xj = 1|gk = 1); these are probabilities of being disabled on\nactivity j for a complete member of extreme profile k. Estimation via variational methods yielded similar results in terms of profile interpretation,\nalthough variational estimates of conditional probabilities were generally\ncloser to the boundaries of the parameter space.\nGiven that the fit of the all-zero pattern is still not very good for the\n9-profile GoM model, we turn to the extended GoM mixture model, incorporating a \"deterministically\" healthy compartment.\n\n\f26\n\nE.

We chose initial values, ran\nMCMC samplers, and determined convergence similarly as in Section 8.1.\nWe set an initial value for the weight of the healthy compartment \u03b81 to be\na positive fraction that is less than the observed proportion of individuals\nwith all-zero responses.\nModel selection. Table 5 provides the expected and observed cell counts\nfor the 23 most frequent response patterns; we excluded the all-zero pattern\nsince the extended GoM mixture fits it precisely. It is difficult to choose\namong K = 7, 8 or 9 based on the expected counts in Table 5, but the\nmodel for K = 8 shows the best fit as indicated by truncated SSPR over the\ndiffering levels of truncation in Table 6.\n\n\f27\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\nFig. 2.\n\nDIC (left) and AICM (right) for the GoM mixture model.\n\nAnalogously to the standard GoM model, we computed a version of AICM\nand a version of DIC obtained directly from the MCMC output.

We therefore examine the 8-profile\nextended GoM mixture model.\nTable 7 provides the conditional response probabilities for the 8 profiles\nthat we interpret in detail at the end of this section.4 Similarly to results\nfrom the standard GoM model with 9 profiles, estimated profile weights \u03be\u0302k ,\nk = 1, . . . , K, are all close to 1/K.

Comparing the estimated conditional\nresponse probabilities, we observe that all but two \"healthy\" profiles from\nthe 9-profile basic GoM model match seven estimated profiles from the 8profile GoM mixture model closely (see k = 6 in Table 7 and k = 7 in Table 4, e.g.). Moreover, the two \"healthy\" profiles from the 9-profile basic\nGoM model do not differ by much (see k = 1 and k = 8 in Table 4); in fact,\n\n\f29\n\nDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\ntaking standard errors into account, they are identical.5 The unmatched\nprofile from the 8-profile GoM mixture model (k = 1 in Table 7) is the new\nhealthy profile.\nTo aid interpretation, we compare the profiles' estimated conditional response probabilities to the average probabilities for each functional disability\nitem. We would like to see by how much the frequency of disability occurrence for each profile differs from the average frequency of occurrence of the\nsame functional disability in the population as a whole. Relative frequencies\nfor profile k, obtained as\n(23)\n\n\u03bbkj /\u03bbj ,\n\nj = 1, . . . , 16,\n\nwhere \u03bbj is the marginal probability for item j, indicate how frequently\neach disability is observed for a complete member of the extreme profile\nin relation to the population average (Table 9). For example, a complete\nmember of extreme profile 6 is about seven times more likely to need help\nwith eating than individuals in the NLTCS sample need on average (11%).\nTable 9 shows values for relative probabilities greater than 1 in red ink.\nAmong estimated extreme profiles in the 8-profile GoM mixture model, we\nfind one healthy profile (k = 1) with all relative frequencies less than the\ncorresponding population averages, while all other profiles have at least one\nactivity with relative frequency greater than the population average. In addition, we find that each estimated profile in the 8-profile GoM mixture model\nhas a unique set of functional disabilities with relative frequencies greater\nthan the corresponding population averages (no two rows in the table have\nidentical placements of values in red ink). We can say then that the estimated 8-profile GoM mixture solution defines a set of admissible profiles in\nthe terminology of Berkman, Singer and Manton (1989). Moreover, taking\ninto account standard errors of the estimates (not shown), we notice that\nall 8 disability profiles are now well separated.\nTable 8\nPosterior mean estimates and standard deviations of the proportion in the healthy\ncompartment for the extended GoM mixture model with K profiles\nK\n\u03b8\u03021\nSD(\u03b8\u03021 )\n\n5\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0.162\n0.0024\n\n0.159\n0.004\n\n0.152\n0.0045\n\n0.148\n0.0054\n\n0.152\n0.0047\n\n0.146\n0.0061\n\n0.141\n0.006\n\n0.154\n0.0045\n\nMCMC estimation in our simulation studies identified emerging identical, up to a\nstandard error, profiles when the number of fitted profiles was greater than the number of\nprofiles that generated the data.\n\n\f30\n\nE.

Relative probabilities for transferring in/out of bed, dressing, toileting, and light housework for this profile\nare at least three times the corresponding averages in the population.\nProfiles k = 3 and k = 4 show patterns of frequencies that are somewhat\nsimilar to each other, indicating frequent difficulties with mobility activities, with profile 3 having noticeably higher frequencies on laundry, grocery\nshopping, and traveling.\nProfile k = 6 is the profile of seriously disabled with most of the disability frequencies greater than 0.8 and greater than the corresponding average\nfrequencies in the population. For a complete member of this profile, difficulties with each eating, dressing, light housework, managing money, taking medicine, and telephoning occur at least four times more often than in\nthe NLTCS sample on average. Profile k = 5 points to low probabilities for\nmost ADL and IADL items, but has a spike at the probability for doing\nheavy housework. An individual corresponding to this profile has difficulties\nwith heavy housework one and a half times more often than the average\n\n\f32\n\nE. A. EROSHEVA, S. E. FIENBERG AND C. JOUTARD\n\nchronically disabled person. This is a significant increase, given that the average frequency to experience difficulty with heavy housework is 0.68 in the\nNLTCS sample.\nProfile k = 8 shows disability frequencies that are slightly higher than\nthe average for heavy housework, grocery shopping, traveling and managing\nmoney. Profile k = 7 exhibits high frequencies for all IADL items, especially\nfor those with significant cognitive components such as cooking, managing\nmoney and telephoning.\nHaving the profile interpretations at hand, we recall that they represent\nextreme types of chronically disabled individuals aged 65 and over. Apart\nfrom an estimated 15% of healthy individuals who have no disabilities with\nprobability one, each (partially disabled) person in the population can be\ndescribed through a vector of membership scores for the eight estimated\nprofiles. Since the hyperparameter estimate \u03b1\u03020 = 0.103 is small, the posterior\ndistribution of grades of membership is bathtub-shaped, which means that\nmembership vectors are dominated by one component for a majority of\nindividuals. Even though we focus on the population parameters in this\npaper, it is possible to use MCMC output to examine posterior distributions\nfor each individual. One could also compute posterior estimates of various\nquantities of interest, such as the percentage of individuals in the sample\nthat have membership vectors dominated by one profile (with gk > 0.95,\ne.g.).\n9. Discussion. Models that allow for specification of continuous latent\nconstructs are increasingly popular among researchers in the social, behavioral, and health sciences since many latent variables of interest can be\nthought of as having fine gradations. When substantive theory justifies distinct latent categories as well as continuous latent variables, approaches that\ndescribe heterogeneity of individuals with respect to those discrete categories\noften focus on class membership probabilities. To give a few examples, Foody\net al. (1992) emphasize the utility of posterior probabilities of class membership in the area of remote sensing; Muthen and Shedden (1999) model\nthe class membership probability as a function of covariates in a study of\nalcohol dependence; Roeder, Lynch and Nagin (1999) address a similar issue\nby modeling uncertainty in latent class assignments in a criminology case\nstudy. The GoM model also addresses the issue of uncertainty in class membership, but by using a different approach that directly incorporates degrees\nof membership as model parameters.\nStandard methods of estimating the GoM model described in Manton,\nWoodbury and Tolley (1994) do not rely on the GoM representation as a\ndiscrete mixture model and have questionable properties [Haberman (1995)],\nincluding instability of MLEs due to ridges in the likelihood function which\n\n\fDISABILITY AND GRADE OF MEMBERSHIP\n\n33\n\nare often present. The Bayesian GoM estimation algorithm developed originally in Erosheva (2002, 2003), on which the present paper is largely based,\nleans heavily on the structure provided by the latent class representation and\nhas several advantages over likelihood-based estimation procedures for the\nGoM model. It is worth emphasizing one more time that the developed latent\nclass representation of the GoM model places identical probability structure\non observable variables and, hence, cannot possibly be distinguished from\nthe continuous mixture GoM model on the basis of data [Erosheva (2006)].\nUnderstanding the latent class representation of the GoM model, and\nthus viewing it as a special instance of individual-level or mixed membership models, makes it easier to establish direct connections with models from\nother areas. For example, although a clustering model with admixture developed for genetic data by Pritchard, Stephens and Donnelly (2000) and the\nstandard GoM model appear to be quite different, they are both instances\nof the more general mixed-membership representation. The generalization\nis flexible enough to accommodate models for other data structures such as\ntext documents [Erosheva, Fienberg and Lafferty (2004)].\nOur goal for the NLTCS analysis in this paper was to explore the population characteristics of disability patterns as measured by the 16 ADL and\nIADL variables. Incorporation of covariates in the GoM modeling would be\nan obvious next step of great interest to social science researchers.\nThe preferred number of components identified by statistical criteria represents our best guess at the latent dimensionality in the NLTCS data under\nthe GoM mixture model with a deterministically healthy compartment. Our\nchoice of dimensionality is based on a number of assumptions, some of which\nmay be worth exploring further. In particular, the assumption of local independence for the full set of ADL and IADL variables may be questionable.\nOne possible approach to relax this assumption suggested by a reviewer is\nto focus on fitting the GoM models separately for the set of ADL and for\nthe set of IADL variables, producing two sets of correlated GoM scores.\nSuch a split-GoM model may turn out to be more appealing to disability\nresearchers and to produce gains in interpretability. We expect to consider\nthis and other forms of model simplification as we work toward our ultimate\ngoal of developing a longitudinal version of the GoM model.\nAcknowledgments.
