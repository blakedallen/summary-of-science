The fractional change of \u03b1 over a two billion year\n\u22127\nperiod has been found from Oklo data to be: \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = +0.45+0.17\n[1], \u22120.56 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u2264\n\u22120.07 \u00d7 10\n\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 \u2264 0.66 \u00d7 10\u22127 [2], \u22120.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u2264 \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 \u2264 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 [5], and either \u22120.18 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u2264\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 \u2264 0.02 \u00d7 10\u22127 or \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = +0.88 \u00b1 0.07 \u00d7 10\u22127 in [6]. By comparison, astrophysics\n\ndeterminations from data on the shifts of the absorption lines in the spectra of quasar light\n\u22127\n\u22127\nhave yielded \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = \u221272+18\n[7] and \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = \u22126+6\n[8] over an approximately\n\u221218 \u00d7 10\n\u22126 \u00d7 10\n\nten billon year period. The sign of \u2206\u03b1 is defined by the relationship \u2206\u03b1 = \u03b1past \u2212 \u03b1present,\nso that a negative sign, for example, means that 2 - 10 billion years ago the value of \u03b1 was\nsmaller than at present. For more results and references on the time variation of fundamental\nconstants see Refs. [9, 10].\nAs the results indicate, the situation is not entirely satisfactory: some analyses give only\nupper limits, while those showing a definite effect disagree even in sign. While theoretical\nmodels have been proposed which can accommodate time dependent rates of change of \u03b1,\nclarifying the disagreements among the Oklo analyses is important, particular since there\nare also questions about just how model-dependent these very precise limits actually are\n[11, 12, 13]. In this paper we will concentrate on the nuclear physics aspects of the Oklo\nreactors, focusing in particular on realistic models of the neutronics.\nThe Oklo phenomenon has been known since 1972. The history of the discovery, the\ngeological background, the relevant petrography, mineralogy, isotopic chemistry and the\nOklo reactors physics are definitively described by Naudet [14]. Most of details of the Oklo\nphenomenon to which we will refer are from this largely unknown text. Findings from more\nrecent Oklo studies are reported in Refs. [15] and [16].\nSixteen natural uranium reactors have been identified in Gabon, West Equatorial Africa,\nin three different ore deposits: at Oklo, at Okelobondo 1.6 km away, and 20 km south of\nOklo at the Bangombe. Collectively, these are called the Oklo Fossil Reactors. Well studied\nreactors include Zone two (RZ2) with more than sixty bore-holes, and more recently Zone\nten (RZ10) with thirteen bore-holes. In RZ2, 1800 kg of\nkyr of operation and in RZ10 about 650 kg of\n2\n\n235\n\n235\n\nU underwent fission over 850\n\nU fissioned (more rapidly) over 160 kyr\n\n\fof operation. All reactor zones were found deficient in\n\n235\n\nU, and in most of them fission\n\nproducts were well retained. Isotopic concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry,\nand provided information on the neutron fluency, the neutron spectral index, and the\n235\n\nU restitution factor (burned\n\nneutron capture on\n\n238\n\n235\n\nU is partly regenerated after \u03b1-decay of\n\n239\n\nPu formed in\n\nU).\n\nDue to the low 0.72%, abundance of 235 U and the high np capture cross section, presentday natural uranium cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction with light water as a moderator.\nHowever, 2000 million years ago 1 , when fission chain reactions started at Oklo,\n\n235\n\nU had a\n\nrelative abundance of 3.7%, comparable to the 3\u22125% enrichment used in most commercial\npower reactors. In those times therefore a chain fission reaction was possible in principle and\nactually took place. Reactors in the northern part of the deposit, including RZ2 and RZ10,\noperated at a depth of several thousand meters, under then-marine sediments which came\nclose to, but still below, the surface after the tectonic uprising about 250 millions years\nago. At this depth, the conditions of pressure and temperature are close to those of the\nPressurized Water Reactors (PWR) of today (temperature around 300 C, pressure about 20\nMPa). Of course, the Oklo reactor powers of 10\u221250 kW are greatly below the 1000-MW\nscale of the present reactors, and furthermore probably did not operate continuously. The\nauthors of Ref. [17] deduced that RZ13 operated for a 0.5 hour until the accumulated heat\nboiled away the water, shutting down the cycle for up to 2.5 hours until the rocks cooled\nsufficiently to allow water saturation to initiate a new cycle.\nShlyakhter [3] was the first person to point out that a change in \u03b1 could shift the position\nof the 97.3-meV neutron resonance in\n\n149\n\nSm and that as a result the present-day capture\n\ncross section could be different from the ancient value. Assuming a reactor temperature\nof 300K, and taking the fission isotope abundances known at that time, he found no\nevidence for a shift in the resonance position and accordingly obtained an upper bound\nfor the fractional change in alpha of 0.1x10\u22127 (a revised number from comments in Ref.\n[2]). Using updated abundance and temperature data, Damour and Dyson [5], and later\nFujii et al. [6] carried out more detailed studies for RZ2 and RZ10. They calculated the\n1\n\nThe age of the Oklo natural reactors is debated in the literature: Fujii et al [6] and Dyson and Damour\n[5] use 2 BY. Naudet cites 1.95 BY [14] and 1.8 BY is used in Ref. [2].\n\n3\n\n\fpresent-day effective cross section by averaging the resonance cross section over a presumed\nfully thermalized Maxwellian neutron spectrum. In such an approach there is no need for\na particular model for the Oklo reactors since the spectrum is determined solely by the\ntemperature. Their results for the variation in \u03b1 were basically in agreement, indicating\nno change. By contrast, in the recent papers [1] and [2], where contradictory results have\nbeen obtained, the averaging is performed over neutron spectra with a 1/E epithermal\ntail in an addition to the Maxwellian contribution. Spectra with different contributions\nfrom the epithermal neutron tail were obtained with an infinite reactor model in Ref.\n[1] and from Monte Carlo modeling of a finite reactor in Ref. [2]. Not surprisingly, the\nuse of different neutron spectra can lead to different results. But since these models are\nnot unique, the question arises as to how to choose between them and between other models.\n\nIn the present work we suggest using measured Oklo reactors epithermal spectral indices\nas criteria for selecting realistic reactor models. We perform MCNP calculations to find full\nscale models of RZ2 and RZ10 satisfying these criteria, and we use the resulting neutron\nflux spectra to calculate the dependence of the effective\nresonance shift. We deduce independently the ancient\n\n149\n\n149\n\nSm capture cross section on the\n\nSm effective neutron capture cross\n\nsection using an updated formalism. From our limits on the 97.3-meV resonance shift, and\nassuming that only electroweak physics is varying, we we can set stringent limits on the\ntime-variation of \u03b1 from the Oklo data.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section II, we review the definition of the effective\ncross section and the definitions of the various spectral indices used to define the contributions of the epithermal neutrons to the neutron flux. In section III, we present our models\nof the Oklo reactor zones, and our MCNP calculations of the neutron spectra. In section\nIV we calculate the\n\n149\n\nSm capture cross section as a function of the resonance energy shift,\n\nand in V we review our new calculation of the ancient\n\n149\n\nSm cross section. In section VI we\n\npresent our results and conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE CROSS SECTIONS AND SPECTRAL INDICES\n\nTo analyze the Oklo reactor data without explicitly specifying the neutron density n(v) at velocity v, it is customary to use not the average cross section \u03c3\u0304 =\n4\n\n\fR\u221e\n0\n\nn(v) \u03c3(v) v dv/\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nn(v) v dv, but instead an effective cross section defined as:\n\u03c3\u0302 =\n\nHere n =\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nn(v) \u03c3(v) v dv/nv0 .\n\n(1)\n\nn(v)dv is the total density, and v0 =2200 m/sec is the velocity of a neutron at\n\nthermal energy 0.0253 eV. To keep R, the reaction rate, unchanged it is necessary also to\nintroduce an effective neutron flux density \u03a6\u0302 =\n\u03a6=\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nn(v) v dv, leading to R = \u03c3\u0302 \u03a6\u0302 = \u03c3\u0304 \u03a6.\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nn(v) v0 dv different from the 'true' flux\n\nWhen the cross section for a particular reaction channel exactly follows a 1/v law\n(\u03c3 = \u03c30 v0 /v), we have \u03c3\u0302 = \u03c30 and the reaction rate \u03c3\u0302 \u03a6\u0302 = \u03c30 nv0 does not depend on\nthe temperature T . When the cross section \u03c3 deviates from the 1/v law at low energies (as\nit does for\n\n149\n\nSm), and when the neutron spectrum is not pure Maxwellian (as is the case\n\nin any realistic reactor), the effective cross section can be written\n\u03c3\u0302 = g(T )\u03c30 + rO I,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g(T ), a function of the temperature T , is a measure of the departure of \u03c3 from the\n1/v law, I is a quantity related to the resonance integral of the cross section and rO is the\nOklo reactor spectral index, a measure of the contribution of epithermal neutrons to the\ncross section. The more well known epithermal Westcott index r [18] is related to rO by\nrO = r\n\ns\n\nT\nT0\n\n(3)\n\nThe Westcott index is a temperature dependent quantity while rO (as shown below) and I\nare independent of temperature.\nSince we will be concerned with extracting rO from neutron spectra calculated by MCNP\nfor specific reactor models, we follow Ref. [18] and introduce the total neutron density n(v)\nand its epithermal fraction fepi :\nn(v) = n [(1 \u2212 fepi ) nth (v) + fepi nepi (v)] ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere nth (v) = (4/\u03c0)(v 3/vT3 ) exp(\u2212v 2 /vT2 ) is the thermal Maxwellian distribution, and\nnepi (v) = vc /v 2 for v > vc , otherwise zero, is an epithermal distribution which holds for\nsystems with zero resonance absorption. Each of the distributions nth (v) and nepi (v) is normalized separately to unity. The velocity vc is an as-yet unspecified cutoff velocity for the\nepithermal distribution and vT is the most probable neutron velocity for Maxwellian with\n5\n\n\f1\n\nthe temperature T as given by vT = v0 (T /T0 ) 2 . The temperature T0 is the temperature of\nthe Maxwellian density distribution having the most probable velocity v0 , defined from the\nrelation mv02 /2 = kT0 = 0.0253 eV.\nThe authors of Ref. [18] suggest cutting off the epithermal distribution at energy Ec =\n\u03bckT with the parameter value \u03bc \u2243 5. The corresponding temperature dependent threshold\n\u221a\nvelocity is then vc = vT \u03bc. At such a threshold the Maxwellian component is already\nseveral times larger than the epithermal one, so such an approximation is satisfactory. The\nWestcott spectral index r is then defined as\n\u221a\n\u03c0\u03bc\nfepi (T ) \u2243 fepi .\nr=\n4\n\n(5)\n\nTo assess the temperature dependence of fepi (T ), we transform from neutron densities to\nneutron fluxes. This yields for the total thermal component \u03c6th \u2261 n(1 \u2212 fepi )v\u0304 = n(1 \u2212\nq\n\nfepi )vT 4/\u03c0, and for an ideal (without resonance absorption) epithermal flux per unit of\nneutron lethargy (lethargy is u = ln(10/EMeV )) \u03c6epi (\u2206u = 1) = nfepi vc /2. Introducing the\nratio\n\u03b4=\nwe find:\n\u03b4=\n\n\u03c6epi (\u2206u = 1)\n,\n\u03c6th\n\u221a\n\n\u03c0\u03bc fepi\n.\n4 1 \u2212 fepi\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nFor small values of fepi and \u03bc \u2243 5, we see that \u03b4 \u2243 fepi . The quantity \u03b4 is calculated in\nreactor physics [18] and for the case of moderation by hydrogen is\n\u03a3a (v0 )\n\u03b4=\n\u03a3(H)\n\ns\n\n\u03c0T0\n.\n4T\n\n(8)\n\nHere \u03a3a (v0 ) is the summed macroscopic absorption cross section at neutron velocity v0 ,\nand \u03a3(H) is the macroscopic scattering cross section of hydrogen in the epithermal region.\nFrom this equation and identifying \u03b4 with fepi we see that the epithermal fraction of the\nneutron density in a reactor behaves as fepi (T ) \u221d\n\nq\n\nT0 /T , thereby confirming that the Oklo\n\nspectral index defined by Eq. 3 is independent of temperature.\nIn realistic systems the epithermal flux deviates from the 1/E dependence due to absorption of neutrons in uranium resonances above an energy of several eV. In this case, two\ndifferent definitions of rO , both approximations, have been used. Ref. [14] relies on the\n6\n\n\fshape of the neutron flux and defines\n\u03c6epi (u\u22c6 )\nrO =\n\u03c6\u22c6th\n\ns\n\nT\n,\nT0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c6epi (u\u22c6 ) is the is the flux per unit of lethargy at some effective energy in the resonance\nregion and \u03c6\u22c6th is the total flux integrated up to an energy where the flux begins to increase\nabove the 1/E level. In Ref. [18] the spectral index r at room temperature is computed as\nthe ratio of the effective macroscopic absorption cross section \u03a3\u0302a to the moderating power\n \u0304 s [18], and therefore\n\u03be\u03a3\n\u03a3\u0302a\nrO =  \u0304 .\n\u03be\u03a3s\nWe compare these three definitions in the next section.\n\n(10)\nIn Ref.\n\n[1], the tempera-\n\nture dependent Weinberg-Wigner [19] thermalization parameter \u2206(T ) = 2A\u03a3a (kT )/\u03a3s\nis used. For the case of hydrogen moderation only, it is related to rO by rO \u2248\n\nq\n\n\u03c0/4 \u2206(T0 )/2.\n\nThe Oklo spectral indices rO are known quantities; their values have been deduced for\nseveral Oklo reactor zones [14], [15], [16], [20] from analysis of the fission products\n147\n\nSm, and the\n\n235\n\n143\n\nNd,\n\nU concentrations. We will use these spectral indices to discriminate\n\nbetween possible models of the ancient reactor zones. In particular, the following experimental values have been deduced: rO = 0.20 \u2212 0.25 for RZ2 and rO = 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 for\nRZ10. The RZ2 result is a range of the borehole SC36 values corrected in Ref. [14] after\nre-evaluation of the cross section \u03c3\u0302143Nd to the expression \u03c3\u0302 = 335 \u2212 100ro . We report the\nRZ10 result as an average from four samples of Ref. [16].\n\nIII.\n\nOKLO REACTOR MODELS AND NEUTRON SPECTRA\n\nThe reactor criticality is determined by the size, geometry and composition of the\nactive zone. The latter influences the energy dependence of the neutron flux. The Oklo\nreactor zones include uraninite UO2 , gangue (oxides of different metals with water of\ncrystallization), water, and poisons that are present initially or build up during operation.\nAmong these parameters, the most uncertain is the amount of water present at the\ntime of reactor operation. In our modeling, we vary this parameter to match the experi-\n\n7\n\n\fmental spectral indices for RZ2 and RZ10 while keeping the reactor under critical conditions.\n\nThe Oklo reactor cores have a characteristic horizontal size of order 10 m and occur\nin sandstone as lens shaped bodies of thickness varying between 20 and about 90 cm.\nThe uranium content ranged from 20 to 80 wt.%. Each core is surrounded by a clay\nmantle. In the past water filled spaces left by cracks and fissures. The effective porosity required to achieve criticality is large (\u223c20%), and is explained by a de-silicication\nprocess [14, 15] consisting of partial leaching of the silica by hot thermal underground water.\n\nTABLE I: Composition (in g/cm3 ) and neutronic parameters of the Oklo reactors.

Our model of an Oklo\nreactor is a flat cylinder of 70 cm height, 6 m diameter, surrounded by a 1 m thick reflector\nconsisting of water saturated sandstone. The compositions (in g/cm3 ) of the two reactors\nare shown in Table I. Reactor zone RZ2 parameters are from Ref. [14] and reactor zone\nRZ10 components are from Refs. [15] and [16]. The total density of the active core material\nat ancient times was about 4 g/cm3 for RZ2 and 3 g/cm3 for RZ10. The most striking\ndifference between RZ2 and RZ10 is the small amount of uraninite UO2 in RZ10. In fact,\nwith such a small amount of UO2 it was not possible to make RZ10 critical with a poison\nmore than 1 ppm of Boron-10 equivalent. The amount of water shown in Table I is a total\namount, also including water of crystallization.\nTo check the effects of chemical bonding, we repeated MCNP calculations using the\noption that considers scattering from hydrogen bound in water molecules. The spectra were\n8\n\n\fessentially unchanged except at the very lowest energies, and calculations of \u03c3\u0302149 (see section\nIV) showed 1% changes or less at all temperatures. All calculations were therefore made\nwith the free gas option.\nRZ10 MCNP fluxes and densities\n10 -7\n\n10 2\n\n10 1\n\nflux\n10 0\n\nT=20 C\n\n10 -1\n\n10 -2\nT=500 C\n\n10 -9\n\n10 -3\n\nNeutron density (arb. units)\n\nFlux times energy (arb. units)\n\n10 -8\n\n10 -4\n10 -10\n10 -5\n\ndensity\n10 -6\n\n10 -11\n\n10 -7\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nNeutron energy (eV)\n\nFIG. 1: Reactor zone RZ10 MCNP neutron fluxes and neutron densities for temperatures 20, 100,\n200, 300, 420, 500 C.

The neutron densities (normalized to one neutron per\nunit volume) are the families of curves starting upper left in each figure. The topmost curve\ncorresponds to 20 C and the lowest curve corresponds to 500 C.\nOklo spectral indices can be calculated from these density plots, using Eqs. 3 and 5, with\na cut off parameter \u03bc = 5.

The difference is mainly\nH\ndue to the small amount of water ( N\n\u2243 3) which is much less than the values we found for\nNU\n\nRZ2, and RZ10. The possibility of a larger amount of water in the core was excluded on the\ngrounds that the reactor would became divergent. While this is true for an infinite reactor\nincluding uranium, water and a poison, it is not true for a finite Oklo reactor that contains\nan additional constituent \u2212 a gangue. Our MCNP modeling confirmed that leakage of\nneutrons from a finite reactor of about 70 cm thick composed of only uranium and a small\namount of water was greater than from an identical geometry reactor with gangue and\nmuch more water. As a consequence the reactor of the Ref. [1] is undercritical if it is made\nfinite.\n\n12\n\n\fThe reactor models in Ref.\n\n[2] are close to ours in geometry but the active core\n\ncompositions differ in uranium and water content. Spectral indices rO were not reported.\nThe 'case 1' model of Ref. [2] has 1.5 g/cm3 of UO2 and 0.355 g/cm3 H2 O at a total density\nof 3.4 g/cm3 with atomic ratio\n\nNH\nNU\n\n= 7.0. This ratio is below our value of 13.0, therefore\n\nwe believe it does not accurately represent RZ10. The\n\nNH\nNU\n\n= 7.0 ratio is close to the ex-\n\npected value for RZ2 but the other compositions deviate from values established in Ref. [14].\n\nIV.\n\nTHE CROSS SECTION AVERAGING PROCEDURE\n\nFollowing previous work, we evaluate the effective capture cross section \u03c3\u0302 for\n\n149\n\nSm\n\nnumerically. The calculations were carried out with the code SPEAKEASY [22]. We include\nall resonances up to 51.6 eV along with the sub-threshold resonance at \u22120.285 eV. We neglect\nresonance interference terms, and use parameters from Mughabghab et al [23]. In practice,\nthe contribution of the 97.3 meV resonance dominates; other resonances contribute only a\nfew per cent to the sum. The bulk of the calculations were carried out neglecting Doppler\nbroadening; separate calculations with the code SAMMY [24] indicated Doppler effects on\n\u03c3\u0302149 were essentially negligible for all temperatures considered, as also found by earlier work.\nThe MCNP calculations provide the neutron flux per energy bin, \u03c6 on a lethargy grid u\nrunning from 23 to 9.3 in steps of 0.1. This gives neutron energies E = 107 e\u2212u in eV from\nabout 1 meV up to 1 keV, with bin widths \u2206E = 0.1E. A finer grid is required for the\nnumerical integrations of cross sections for resonance neutrons since typical total resonance\nwidths in\n\n149\n\nSm are of order 100 meV. Accordingly, the MCNP flux is interpolated on to\n\na lethargy grid with step size 0.001 (\u2206E = 0.001E). The flux is also re-normalized by\nrequiring the total neutron density to sum to unity (n = 1).\nThe effective cross section \u03c3\u0302 is evaluated numerically using\n\u03c3\u0302 =\n\n1 XX\n\u03c3ij \u03c6i .\nv0 i j\n\n(11)\n\nHere \u03c3ij is the Breit Wigner cross section for resonance j at neutron energy Ei , \u03c6i is the\nneutron flux at energy Ei in a bin of width 0.001Ei , and v0 = 2200 m/s is the velocity of a\nthermal neutron.\nThe Breit Wigner cross section \u03c3ij for a neutron of mass m, energy Ei at resonance j\n13\n\n\f149 Sm RZ2(dotted) and RZ10(solid)\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\nCross section (kb)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\nT=20 C\n\n40\n\nT=500 C\n\n20\n\n0\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nResonance shift (eV)\n\nFIG. 3: Calculations of the\n\n149 Sm\n\neffective capture cross section \u03c3\u0302149 as a function of a possible\n\nresonance energy shift \u2206r from -200 meV to +200 meV.

Temperatures run from top to bottom;\nin each case T = 20 C is the top curve, and 500 C is the bottom curve. All resonances\nup to 51.6 eV are included in calculations, and are assumed to shift the same amount.\nCalculations with Maxwell-Boltzman spectra were also performed; in all cases they agreed\nclosely with previous work.\n\nV.\n\nCALCULATION OF THE ANCIENT CAPTURE CROSS SECTION\n\nTo rederive the ancient\n\n149\n\nSm capture cross section, we consider the time evolution of\n\nthe number densities NA (t) of the six isotopes of interest and\n\n149\n\n235\n\nU,\n\n238\n\nU,\n\n239\n\nPu,\n\n147\n\nSm,\n\n148\n\nSm,\n\nSm. We model the time dependence of the densities by the following set of coupled\n\ndifferential equations:\ndN5\n\u03bb9\n= \u2212\u03c3\u03025,tot N5 + N9\n\u03c6\u0302dt\n\u03c6\u0302\ndN8\n= \u2212\u03c3\u030280 N8 \u2212 \u0393\n\u03c6\u0302dt\ndN9\n\u03bb9\n= \u03c3\u030280 N8 \u2212 N9 \u2212 \u03c3\u03029,tot N9 + \u0393\n\u03c6\u0302dt\n\u03c6\u0302\n15\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n\n\f\u0393 = (1 \u2212 p)(\u03bd9 \u03c3\u0302f,9 N9 + \u03bd5 \u03c3\u0302f,5 N5 )\n\n(19)\n\ndN147\n= \u2212\u03c3\u0302147 N147 + \u03c3\u03025,f Y5,147 N5 + \u03c3\u03029,f Y9,147 N9\n\u03c6\u0302dt\ndN148\n= \u2212\u03c3\u0302148 N148 + \u03c3\u0302147 N147\n\u03c6\u0302dt\ndN149\n= \u2212\u03c3\u0302149 N149 + \u03c3\u0302148 N148 + \u03c3\u03025,f Y5,149 N5 + \u03c3\u03029,f Y9,149 N9 .\n\u03c6\u0302dt\nIn these equations, the subscripts 5, 8, and 9 refer to\n\n235\n\nU,\n\n238\n\nU, and\n\n239\n\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n\nPu, respectively,\n\nand tot and f refer to the total (absorption) and fission cross sections. The average neutron\nflux, \u03c6\u0302, is assumed to be constant on a time scale long compared to the decay constants\nin the problem. The Y represent the fission yields to the Sm isotopes of interest, the\n147\n\nsubscripts 147, 148, and 149 refer to\n\nSm,\n\naverage number of neutrons produced by\n\n148\n\n235\n\nSm, and\n\nU and\n\n239\n\n149\n\nSm, respectively, and \u03bd5,9 are the\n\nPu, respectively. We take the reactor\n\nstart time as two billion years ago at t0 = 0 and the end of operation for RZ10 as t1 = 160\nkyr and for RZ2 as t1 = 850 kyr.\nOur calculation differs from the work of Fujii et al. [6] in that we explicitly incorporate\nthe resonance escape probability, p in modeling the restitution of\nterm for the\n\n239\n\n235\n\nU. We also include a\n\nPu alpha decay rate, 1/\u03bb9 = 24.141/ ln(2) = 34.8 kyr which leads to a\n\nreduction in the restitution of\n\n235\n\nU, the issue being that 34.8 kyr is not small compared to\n\nthe reactor operating lifetime of 160 kyr for RZ10.\nThe resonance escape probability is the probability that a neutron produced by fission is\nnot absorbed on the principal absorber in the system,\n\n238\n\nU, when moderating through the\n\nresonance region. The quantity (1 \u2212 p) therefore gives the fraction of fission neutrons that\nare absorbed by\n\n238\n\nU, most of which eventually converted to\n\nC is defined as the ratio of atoms\n\n239\n\n239\n\nPu. The conversion factor\n\nPu produced to the number of atoms\n\n235\n\nU \"burned\" in\n\nthermal neutron absorption. It is calculated (Eq. (7.8) in Ref. [19]) as\nC=R\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c3\u0302f,5\n\u03c3\u030280\n+ (1 \u2212 p)\u03bd5\n,\n\u03c3\u03025,tot\n\u03c3\u03025,tot\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the first term is the contribution to conversion from thermal neutrons (here R is the\nfraction of atoms\nof neutrons by\n235\n\n238\n\n235\n\nU in the uranium fuel), and the second term is due to the absorption\n\nU in the resonance region. Not all converted atoms end as the restituted\n\nU atoms, because some atoms\n\n239\n\nPu will be burned in the thermal neutron flux \u03c6\u0302. The\n16\n\n\frestitution factor C \u2217 is defined as\nC\u2217 =\n\nC\n1 + \u03c6\u0302 \u03c3\u03029,tot\n\u03bb9\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nThe expected value of p is shown in Table I and is calculated as follows. For U in a\ncomposite moderator, the definition of the resonance escape probability is\n1\np = exp \u2212  \u0304\n\u03be\u03a3s\n\nZ\n\ndE\n\u03a3a\n1 + \u03a3a /\u03a3s E\n\n!\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nNU res\n\u2261 exp \u2212  \u0304 Ief\n,\n\u03be\u03a3s f\n\n(25)\n\nres\nwhere the effective resonance integral Ief\nf for a homogeneous mixture of fuel and moderator\n\nwas found in experimental and theoretical works [19] (Eq. (10.29)) to be\nres\nIef\nf\n\n1024 \u03a3s\n= 3.8\nNU\n\n!0.42\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nIn these equations, \u03a3s is the total macroscopic scattering cross section of all elements in\nthe active core, and \u03be \u0304 is the corresponding effective logarithmic energy loss defined by (Ref.\nP\nP\n[19], Eq. (10.20)) as \u03be \u0304 = i \u03bei \u03a3si / i \u03a3si .\n\nNote that these equations assume that the atoms are free for the energy loss, i.e.,\n\nchemical bond effects are neglected.\n\nBecause the resonance integral is over the range\n\n0.5 eV to 100 keV, the effects of chemical bonds are expected to be small. From these\nequations and using the RZ10 characteristics from Table III, we calculate for RZ10 the\nvalue (1 \u2212 p) = 0.155. Eq. 23 gives C(RZ10) = 0.11 + 2.05(1 \u2212 p) = 0.43. For the\nmetasample RZ10 flux (see later) we then get C \u2217 = 0.77C = 0.33, in reasonable agreement\n\nwith C \u2217 = 0.38, the average of the values quoted in Hidaka and Holliger (HH) [16].\n\nThe coupled equations are solved with input parameters [14] listed in (Table IV). We\nconfirmed the correctness of these effective cross sections by also calculating the integral \u03c3\u0302 =\nR\n\nq\n\n\u03c3(E)\u03a6(E, T )dE/ \u03a6(E, T )/ E/0.0253dE) with our MCNP fluxes. Because the resonance\nR\n\nescape probability represents the capture probability for E > 0.5 eV, \u03c3\u030280 is determined by\nintegrating to 0.5 eV, the rest of the resonance integral being incorporated into the resonance\nescape probability.\nThe coupled equations are solved as follows. First, fixing 1\u2212p = 0.155 for RZ10, and with\nstarting parameters N5 (0) = 0.0370, N8 (0) = 0.963, N9 (0) = 0, we can solve the first three\nequations for the fluence \u03c6\u0302t1 which reproduces the N5 (t1 )/N8 (t1 ) \u2261 (N5 (t1 ) + N9 (t1 ))/N8 (t1 )\n\nratio determined by the present-day HH data for each RZ10 sample. We use TO = 2 \u00d7 109\n17\n\n\fTABLE IV: Effective cross sections for RZ10 and RZ2 used to determine \u03c3\u0302149 (Cross sections are\nbased on data from Naudet.

We also calculate values for a metasample which\nrepresents an average of the individual sample properties. The idea of the metasample is\nthat there could have been internal mixing between the samples or other processes. It is\nalso useful to see whether the sample averages provide results in a reasonable range.\nWith the fluence fixed, we next vary the starting amount of elemental Sm relative to\nU, NSm (0)/NU (0) to reproduce the ending isotopic fraction f147 (t1 ), and then vary the\ncross section \u03c3\u0302149 to reproduce the ending isotopic fraction f149 (t1 ). We use the natural abundancies to convert from an elemental starting ratio to the isotopic starting ratios\n(f144 (0) = 0.031,f147 (0) = 0.151, f148 (0) = 0.113, and f149 (0) = 0.139). In principle the\nstarting fraction of Sm relative to U, while very small, is not a free parameter; it is determined by data for f144 (t1 ) since\n\n144\n\nSm is not produced in fission:\n\nf144 (t1 )NSm (t1 ) = f144 (0)NSm (0).\n\n(27)\n\nIn practice, while \u03c3\u0302149 can be tuned closely to match f149 (t1 ) we were not able to reproduce\nf147 (t1 ) without also varying NSm (0)/NU (0). Table V summarizes our results. The measured\nvalues from HH are shown above the empty line and our calculated values for N5 (t1 )/N8 (t1 ),\nf147 (t1 ) and f149 (t1 ) are shown below the empty line, along with our calculated fluences,\ncalculated starting fractions of elemental Sm relative to U, and calculated \u03c3\u0302149 values for\nthe four RZ10 samples and the metasample. The mean of the four values is 89.4 kb, with\nsample standard deviation 6.8 kb.\nThe starting fractions, NSm (0)/NU (0) vary, but are consistent with HH data for bore\nholes 1640 and 1700 outside the reactor zones, and apart from 1480 are within a factor\nof two of values predicted by the HH data. The mean value for the ending amount of\nNSm (t1 ) = 74.6 \u00b1 19.6 \u03bcgms/gm agrees well with the mean of the measured HH values\n67.8 \u00b1 36.0 \u03bcgms/gm, also giving us confidence that the starting ratios are reasonable.\n18\n\n\fAs a final value for RZ10 we adopt the cross section extracted for the metasample, and\nto take account of sample-to-sample variations we adopt the sample standard deviation as\na 1\u03c3 uncertainty:\n\u03c3\u0302149 = 85.0 \u00b1 6.8kb.\n\n(28)\n\nThis is in good agreement with the mean of the four RZ10 samples analyzed by Fujii et al.\n[6]: 91.2 \u00b1 7.6 kb, again taking their sample standard deviation as a 1\u03c3 error.\nData for fifteen RZ2 samples were analyzed by Damour and Dyson [5], who set a 2\u03c3 bound\n57 \u2264 \u03c3\u0302149 \u2264 93 kb. Results from RZ2 have tended to show more scatter because the samples\ncome from mining near the surface with a greater potential for contamination compared to\nthe deep underground samples for RZ10. Nevertheless we repeated our calculations for the\nfive RZ2 samples from borehole SC36 - 1408 to 1418 - cited by Ruffenach [21] as having the\nmost important contributions of elements formed in fission. We followed the same procedure\nas for RZ10, also including analysis of a metasample formed by averaging the input data for\nthe five individual samples. With (1 \u2212 p) fixed, we varied the flux to match the U isotope\nratios, and then varied \u03c3\u0302149 and the starting elemental ratio of Sm and U to reproduce the\nending f147 (t1 ) and f149 (t1 ) fractions. Table VI summarizes the results. The average of the\nfive values is 75.6 kb with a sample standard deviation of 10.0 kb. The metasample value is\n71.5 kb, and we therefore adopt as our RZ2 result:\n\n\u03c3\u0302149 = 71.5 \u00b1 10.0kb,\n\n(29)\n\na value consistent with the RZ10 result and with the Damour and Dyson analysis.\n\nVI.\n\nRESULTS FOR RESONANCE SHIFT AND CHANGE IN \u03b1\n\nTo calculate bounds on the possible shift of the\n\n149\n\nSm resonances over time we use the\n\nRZ10 result \u03c3\u0302149 = 85.0 \u00b1 6.8 kb, and conservatively adopt a \u00b12\u03c3 range to establish limits:\n71.4 \u2264 \u03c3\u0302149 \u2264 98.6 kb. We further assume that the reactor operated between 200 and 300 C\nas per the analysis by Meshick et al. [17], which limits the temperature to this range, and\nas per knowledge that the geological formation and depth would not allow liquid water to\nbe present above 300 C.\nAn expanded version of the calculated RZ10 \u03c3\u0302149 cross sections at 200 and 300 C is shown\n\n19\n\n\fTABLE V: RZ10 calculated fluences \u03c6\u0302t1 and ancient cross sections \u03c3\u0302149 .

A 10% change in p therefore leads to\na change in \u2206r of order 5 meV, well within the 2\u03c3 bounds assumed in extracting our final\nresult.\nIn their analysis Damour and Dyson assumed that changes in the nuclear part of the\nHamiltonian did not correlate with with changes in the Coulomb energy over time. They\nnoted that changes in the mq /mp could, in principle, show themselves as changes of the\nresonance position. However, at that time there was no theory to allow estimates of such\neffects. Recent QCD-based developments have speculated that a time variation in \u03b1 could\nbe accompanied by a larger (up to a factor of 30 or more) variation of the QCD scale\nparameter \u039b (= 213 MeV) [12, 13, 26] which characterizes the masses of participating\n21\n\n\f130\n\nT=200 C\n110\n\nRZ10 149 Sm Cross Section (kb)\n\nT=300 C\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\n30\n\n10\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nEnergy Shift (meV)\n\nFIG. 4: Expanded version of the RZ10 cross section plot of fig. 3 for temperatures 200 C and 300\nC, and the bounds on \u2206r obtained from our \u00b12\u03c3 limits on the \u03c3\u0302149 .\n\nparticles. Changes in the effective nuclear potential from, e.g. changes in m\u03c0 /mp could, in\nprinciple, therefore have a significant effect on the resonance shift. A detailed theoretical\nanalysis and quantitative estimates of the nuclear physics aspects of the neutron resonance\nshift remain to be carried out. In such a situation the present result from the Oklo reactor\ndata while stringent - and consistent with no shift in \u03b1 over a two billion year period - should\n\n22\n\n\fbe regarded as a model dependent [9, 11].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Dr. R.
