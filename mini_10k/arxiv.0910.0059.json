Here\nwe report on a new class of luminous SNe whose observed properties cannot\nbe explained by any of these known processes. These include four new SNe\nwe have discovered, and two previously unexplained events[5, 6] (SN 2005ap;\nSCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members. These SNe are all \u223c 10\ntimes brighter than SNe Ia, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (UV) flux for extended periods of time, and have late-time\ndecay rates which are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that\nthe observed radiation is emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over\na large radius (\u223c 1015 cm) and expanding at high velocities (> 104 km\u22121 s\u22121 ).\nThese long-lived, UV-luminous events can be observed out to redshifts z > 4\nand offer an excellent opportunity to study star formation in, and the inter-\n\n\fstellar medium of, primitive distant galaxies.\nThe Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)[7, 8] is a project dedicated to finding explosive events and has so far identified over a thousand SNe. PTF09atu, PTF09cnd, and\nPTF09cwl (also SN 2009jh[9]) were detected by the 1.2 m Samuel Oschin Telescope during commissioning of the PTF system, and PTF10cwr[10, 11, 12] (also SN 2010gx[13])\nwas detected the following year (Figure 1; see Supplementary Information [SI] \u00a7 1). As\nwith other SN candidates, optical spectra for classification were obtained by the 10 m\nKeck I, 5.1 m Palomar, and 4.2 m William Herschel telescopes. The spectra (Figure 2)\nshow broad absorption dips at short wavelengths and mostly smooth continua to the red\nthereof. We further identify narrow absorption features in the PTF spectra from the\nMg II \u03bb\u03bb2796, 2803 doublet, and measure redshifts of z = 0.501, 0.258, 0.349, and 0.230\nfor PTF09atu, PTF09cnd, PTF09cwl, and PTF10cwr, respectively. After combining the\nthree available spectra of the SCP 06F6 transient, we find the data correlate to the PTF\nsample and may also show narrow Mg II absorption redshifted by z = 1.189 (SI \u00a7 4).\nSimilarly to all PTF events, SN 2005ap (z = 0.283) shows a distinct \"W\" absorption\nfeature near rest wavelength 4300 \u00c5. Although the broad spectral features of SN 2005ap\nare systematically shifted to higher velocities, the over-all resemblance is striking. The\nPTF discoveries bridge the redshift gap between SCP 06F6 and SN 2005ap and link these\nonce disparate events, thus unifying them all into a single class.\nWith the redshifts above and standard H0 = 71, \u03a9m = 0.27 flat cosmology, the peak\nabsolute u-band AB magnitudes[14] for the PTF transients in the rest frame are near\n\u221222, and \u221222.3 for SCP 06F6 (Figure. 3). The \u223c50 day rise of SCP 06F6 to maximum\nin the rest frame is compatible with the PTF sample, although there appears to be some\ndiversity in the rise and decline timescales. To power these high peak magnitudes with\nradioactivity, several solar masses of\n\n56\n\nNi are needed (> 10 M\u2299 , e.g., ref. [15]), and yet\n\nin the rest frame V -band, the post-maximum decline rates of the PTF events are all\n> 0.03 mag day\u22121 , which is a few times faster than the decay rate of\ndaughter nucleus of\n\n56\n\n56\n\nCo (the long-lived\n\nNi). These are therefore not radioactively-powered events.\n\n\fNext we check if the observed photons could have been deposited by the explosion\nshock as it traversed the progenitor star. The photospheric radius Rph we infer for\nPTF09cnd at peak luminosity, based on the observed temperature and assuming blackbody emission, is Rph \u223c 5\u00d71015 cm (SI Figure S1). If the radiated photons were generated\nduring the star explosion, then adiabatic losses imply that only a fraction R\u2217 /Rph of the\nenergy remains in the radiation at any given time where R\u2217 is the initial stellar radius.\nGiven that the energy radiated around the peak is \u223c 1051 erg and that for any reasonable\nhydrogen-stripped progenitor R\u2217 /Rph < 10\u22123 , this model requires an unrealistic total explosion energy of > 1054 erg. In fact the large radius and the duration of PTF09cnd leave\nalmost no place for adiabatic losses (SI \u00a7 5), implying that the internal energy must have\nbeen deposited at a radius that is not much smaller than Rph .\nIntegrating the rest frame g-band light curve and assuming no bolometric correction,\nwe find that PTF09cnd radiated \u223c1.2\u00d71051 erg. A similar analysis of the SCP 06F6 data\ngives a radiated energy of \u223c1.7\u00d71051 erg. We also fit Planck functions to the UV and\noptical observations of PTF09cnd (SI Figure S1) and find an approximate bolometric\noutput of \u223c1.7\u00d71051 erg. The derived black body radii indicate a photospheric expansion\nof vphot \u223c 14, 000 km s\u22121 . If the main source of luminance is the conversion of kinetic\nenergy, then the bolometric energy would require \u223c1 M\u2299 of material at this velocity,\nassuming a conversion efficiency of 100%. A more realistic efficiency factor would make\nthe minimum mass a few times larger. Since no traces of hydrogen are seen in any of the\nspectra (SI \u00a7 3), interaction with regular H-rich CSM is ruled out. We thus conclude that\nthese events cannot be powered by any of the commonly invoked processes driving known\nsupernova classes.\nThe early spectra presented here are dominated by oxygen lines, and do not show\ncalcium, iron, or other features commonly seen in regular core-collapse SNe. The lack of\nmetals is particularly noticeable in the UV flux, which is typically depleted by absorption.\nThese events are hosted by low-luminosity galaxies that may provide a sub-solar progenitor environment (SI \u00a7 6). The new class of events we identified is thus observationally\n\n\fcharacterized by extreme peak luminosities, rapid decay times inconsistent with radioactivity, very hot early spectra with significant UV flux, and lacking absorption lines from\nheavy elements like calcium and iron commonly seen in all other types of SNe.\nThese observations require a late deposition of a large amount of energy (> 1051 erg)\ninto hydrogen-poor, fast-expanding material (slow moving material would produce narrow spectroscopic features, which are not observed). We point out two possible physical processes that can perhaps power these super-luminous sources. One is a strong\ninteraction with a massive, rapidly-expanding, hydrogen-free shell or wind. Such a scenario is naturally produced by extremely massive stars with initial masses in the range\n90 M\u2299 <M\nM\u2299 , which are expected[16, 17] to undergo violent pulsations, per\u223c i <130\n\u223c\nhaps driven by the pair-instability, stripping their outer layers and expelling massive\nH-poor shells. The star eventually dies through a stripped-envelope, core-collapse supernova, which may interact with previously ejected C/O-rich shells to drive the observed\nluminosity[18]. Alternatively, the power source can be a prolonged energy injection by a\ncentral engine. For example, a spinning-down nascent magnetar[19, 20] can account for\nthe peak luminosities (> 1044 erg s\u22121 ) and time to peak light (30-50 days) observed for\nthese events, assuming a magnetic field B \u2248 1-3 \u00d7 1014 G and a natal spin of 1-3 ms.\nThe high luminosities, exceptionally blue spectral energy distributions, and rates (SI\n\u00a7 7) of this new class of supernovae make them prime targets for high redshift studies\n(SI Figure S3). Lingering around maximum light for months to years in the observer\nframe, these events provide a steady light source to illuminate their environs and any\nintervening clouds of gas and dust. This creates new opportunities for high resolution\nspectroscopy to probe distant star-forming regions in primitive galaxies, without the need\nfor rapid scheduling, and with the benefit that the luminous SN beacon eventually fades,\nallowing to study the galaxy itself. Indeed these light houses mark a rich port for future\nthirty-meter-class-telescope science.\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n\nWoosley, S. E. & Weaver, T. A. The physics of supernova explosions. Ann. Rev.

[6] (grey). The spectra\nhave been de-redshifted, binned, and scaled arbitrarily for display purposes. Broad band flux\ndensities from the Swift observations (scaled to join the spectra in the u-band) are plotted for\nPTF09cnd, PTF09cwl, and PTF10cwr with 1-\u03c3 error bars. Five absorption bands are marked\nby the combs above SN 2005ap and PTF09cnd, the former being \u22487,000 km s\u22121 faster. b, These\nfeatures can be well fit by O II using the highly parametric spectral synthesis code, SYNOW[21]\n(see SI \u00a7 2). SYNOW fits also suggest that C II and Mg II can account for the 2200 \u00c5 and\n2700 \u00c5 features, respectively. The fit to the 2500 \u00c5 line is improved with the addition of Si III.\nThe model shown has a photospheric velocity of 15,000 km s\u22121 . c, Close-up views of the narrow\nMg II doublet, from which we derive the redshifts.\n\n\fAbsolute u\u2212band AB magnitude\n\nSCP 06F6\nSN 2005ap\nPTF09cnd\nPTF09cwl\nPTF09atu\nPTF10cwr\n\n\u221222\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221216\nSS SS\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n50\n100\nRest\u2212frame phase (days)\n\n150\n\nFigure 3: Luminosity evolution of the SN 2005ap-like sample. Shown are the SCP 06F6 transient (diamonds), SN 2005ap (hash marks), PTF09atu (orange triangles), PTF09cnd (purple\ndots), PTF09cwl (blue squares), and PTF10cwr (green pentagons). In each case we transform\nthe observed photometry to absolute u-band magnitudes by correcting both for distance and\ndifferences in the effective rest frame band pass introduced by the redshifts. For SCP 06F6, the\nobserved i-band is similar to the rest frame u-band, so the correction factor is nearly independent from the spectral properties[22]. For the PTF sample, however, the correction factor varies\nover time as the spectra cool. We interpolated the observed spectra of PTF09cnd to phases\nappropriate for the B, g, V , and r-band observations of the PTF sample to calculate the correction factors. Statistical, 1 \u03c3 errors (excluding the color correction) are shown when larger than\nthe plotting symbols. The color corrections for PTF09atu and PTF09cwl near day 100 are very\nuncertain (\u223c0.5 mag). We have not removed possible host light contaminating the late time observations of PTF09atu, PTF09cnd, and PTF09cwl (open symbols). Thus these measurements\nrepresent upper limits on the supernova light. Host galaxy light may in fact dominate the final\nPTF09cwl observation. The final observation of SCP 06F6 (open diamond) is a 2.5\u03c3 detection\nmade from the ground. Along the abscissa we note the phases of the spectra shown in Figure 2\neach with an \"S.\"\n\n\f"}
