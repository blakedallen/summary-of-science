We have recently described a novel method for the construction of a solid-state optical\nfrequency reference based on doping 229 Th into high energy band-gap crystals [1]. Since nuclear\ntransitions are far less sensitive to environmental conditions than atomic transitions, we have\nargued that the 229 Th optical nuclear transition may be driven inside a host crystal resulting\nin an optical frequency reference with a short-term stability of 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 < \u2206f /f < 1 \u00d7 10\u221215\nat 1 s and a systematic-limited repeatability of \u2206f /f \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 . Improvement by 102 \u2212 103\nof the constraints on the variability of several important fundamental constants also appears\npossible. Here we present the results of the first phase of these experiments. Specifically, we\nhave evaluated several high energy band-gap crystals (Th:NaYF, Th:YLF, Th:LiCAF, Na2 ThF6 ,\nLiSAF) for their suitability as a crystal host by a combination of electron beam microprobe\nmeasurements, Rutherford Backscattering, and synchrotron excitation/fluorescence measurements.\nThese measurements have shown LiCAF to be the most promising host crystal, and using a 232 Th\ndoped LiCAF crystal, we have performed a mock run of the actual experiment that will be used to\nsearch for the isomeric transition in 229 Th. This data indicates that a measurement of the transition\nenergy with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) greater than 30:1 can be achieved at the lowest expected\nfluorescence rate.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe existence of a low-lying state in 229 Th, with an estimated natural linewidth, \u0393n , in the range\n0.1 \u2264 \u0393n /2\u03c0 \u2264 10 mHz [2, 3], was indirectly established over 3 decades ago [4]. However, direct\nsearches for emission from this M1 transition have so far been unsuccessful [2]. Recently, a new\nindirect measurement has established that the transition energy is 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 eV [5], rather than\n3.5 eV as orginally thought. Although well into the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), this energy is\namenable to study by laser spectroscopy, opening the door for use of this transition as a highly\nstable oscillator in next generation optical clocks. The transition is also predicted to show a 106 -fold\nenhancement in sensitivity to the time variation of several fundamental constants[6, 7], e.g. the fine\nstructure constant. While the current measurement uncertainty of the nuclear transition energy\n\n\fis very good by nuclear physics standards, it must be drastically improved in order to realize the\nexciting applications of this transition.\nWe have recently proposed a novel approach to directly measure the transition energy to a much\nhigher precision by interrogating 229 Th that has been doped into a VUV transparent crystal [8, 9, 1].\nUsing this approach more than 1019 Th nuclei can be interrogated, which allows for fluorescence\nrates sufficient to directly measure the transition energy using a broadband synchrotron light source.\nIn this article, we present measurements of inherent VUV-induced background signals which\ncould mask fluorescence from the isomer state in 229 Th for several candidate host crystals. While\nthe data shows that many of the crystals display some spurious fluorescence, the fluorescence is in\ngeneral of a low level and short-lived compared to that expected from the isomeric transition. Of all\nthe crystals measured, we have determined LiCAF (LiCaAlF6 ) to be the most suitable as it yields\nvery little background fluorescence when it is directly illuminated with VUV light. Additonally,\nit shows resilience to VUV-induced radiation damage and has been grown with 232 Th as a dopant\nat the 0.05% level. It also has several key structural properties that mitigate broadenings of the\nisomeric transition energy in a crystal environment.\n2. Experimental Results\nThe first steps towards realizing the exciting applications of this transition are identifying suitable\nhost crystals and determining the transition frequency to a greater precision. The key requirements\nfor the host crystal are that it be reasonably transparent in the VUV, have a pure crystalline\nstructure, and chemically accept Th4+ ions. Numerous candidate hosts can be identified in the\nextensive family of fluoride crystals. Potential crystals include Na2 ThF6 , LiCAF (LiCaAlF6 ),\nLiSAF (LiSrAlF6 ), YLF (YLiF4 ), and CaF2 , which can be grown by various techniques, e.g.\nCzochralski, Bridgman, etc. [10, 11]. While these crystals have band-gaps of >10 eV, impurities and\ncolor centers can cause residual absorption and may interfere with the 229 Th optical spectroscopy.\nVarious metal ions as well as oxygen-based impurities at the part-per-million level can lead to\nabsorption coefficients of up to 0.1 cm\u22121 [12]. To ensure crystal transparency, purification methods\nmust be employed to reduce these impurities to part-per-billion levels [13]. We have applied these\nmethods to the preparation of high purity metal fluoride precursors for crystal growth.\nSo far, we have studied crystals that were obtained commercially from AC Materials. These\ninclude Na2 ThF6 , Th:LiCAF, Th:YLF, and Th:NaYF which were grown using the less expensive,\nbut chemically identical, 232 Th isotope. The Th:NaYF and Th:YLF were grown with a target\ndoping of 0.1% molar while the Th:LiCAF was grown with a target doping of 1% molar. These\ncrystals are good control crystals as the isomeric transition is not present in 232 Th, but are\nchemically identical and thus the doping process as well as all VUV induced backgrounds are\nthe same. They therefore allow us to study which crystals are most suitable for higher precision\nmeasurements of the isomeric transition energy.\n2.1. Synchrotron excitation measurements\nAs previously mentioned, a major advantage to our approach for measuring the isomer energy is\nthe large number of 229 Th nuclei that can be addressed. This allows for fluorescence rates sufficient\nfor the use of standard spectroscopic techniques to determine the transition energy to a higher\nprecision. We plan to use a multi-phase experimental approach [1] to investigate the ulimate\nprecision to which this transition energy can be measured.\nThe first phase will be a low resolution study using the 9.0.2.1 beam line at the Advanced\nLight Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. The ALS provides a tunable VUV light source\n(5 eV-30 eV) with a linewidth (\u2206) of 0.175 eV, a photon flux (\u03a6p ) of \u223c1020 photons/cm2 *s, and a\n170 \u03bcm \u00d7 50 \u03bcm spot size. Assuming both the light (\u2206) and broadened transition (\u0393) linewidths\n\n\fto be Lorentzian, then far from saturation, the excitation rate,\ndNe\n\u2248\ndt\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\ndNe\ndt ,\n\nis given by\n\n1\n\u0393n\n\u03a6p Ng\n\u03c9\n0 \u2212\u03c9L 2\n\u0393 + \u2206 1 + 4( \u0393+\u2206\n)\n\nwhere \u03c90 (\u03bb) is the transition frequency (wavelength), \u03c9L is the center frequency of the ALS beam,\nand Ng is the total number of ground state 229 Th nuclei addressed by the ALS beam. To locate the\ntransition the ALS center frequency will be scanned across the interesting range of (7.8 \u00b1 0.5 eV)\nin steps of 0.05 eV with 200 s of illumination followed by 100 s of light collection at each point.\nEven in the lowest fluorescence case (\u0393n = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 100 \u03bcHz), we expect a minimum total fluorescence\nrate of \u223c15 kHz when the ALS is on resonance.\nOnce the resonance is found, longer illumination will lead to sufficient fluorescence rates for a\nVUV spectrometer measurement. We expect that the transition frequency can be determined to\n\u223c50 cm\u22121 (0.1 nm) in these experiments, but this of course relies on sufficiently low background\nfluorescence rates. As a result, we have performed test runs on our control crystals using the VUV\nlight beam at the ALS.\nThe setup used is shown in Fig. 1. Each control crystal (3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 10 mm) was illuminated\nalong its long axis with the ALS beam and any resultant fluorescence from the crystal was collected\nin a direction orthogonal to the beam via a 2-lens system. Both lenses were fabricated from LiF\nand held in vacuum. The fluorescence was imaged onto the photocathode of a photomultiplier\ntube (PMT) (Hamamatsu R7639). The PMT was either under a constant Argon purge or held in\nvacuum to mitigate VUV absorption by air.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, two pneumatic shutters were mounted inside the vacuum chamber. One\nshutter was used to prevent VUV scattered light from hitting the PMT during crystal illumination,\nand the second shutter was used to block the ALS beam before photon collection with the PMT\nbegan. This introduced a small delay between the point when illumination ended and photon\ncollection began, but in all cases the delay was less than 28 ms. As the shortest prediction for\nthe 229 Th isomer lifetime is \u223c100 s this is sufficiently fast to investigate any spurious long-lived\nbackground fluorescence signals in the host crystal that might interfere with measuring fluorescence\nfrom the isomeric transition. In what follows, we present the data for all crystals that we have\nmeasured to date.\n2.1.1. Th:NaYF\nThe data for Th:NaYF is shown in Fig. 2. The excitation spectrum was obtained by illuminating\nthe crystal for 5 s with the ALS beam at a fixed energy and then collecting photons from the crystal\nover the next 10.7 s using the full bandwidth of the PMT (120 nm - 220 nm). Due to limitations\nin the operation of the beam and PMT shutters, there was a delay of 28 ms between the end of\nthe illumination period and photon collection period. At each excitation energy, the process was\nrepeated 5 times. The data points and their error bars in the figure are the average and standard\ndeviation of the results. The data shown takes into account the photon detection efficiency and\nthe y-axis is therefore the total average fluorescence rate from the crystal over the 10.7 s of photon\ncollection. The background fluorescence rate, measured by leaving the VUV light beam blocked\nblocked during the illumination stage, was consistent with PMT dark counts (\u223c1 Hz) and has been\nsubtracted in the plot.\nThere is clearly a very large fluorescence peak at a beam energy \u22647.4 eV, however, because the\nALS was in high energy mode (electron storage ring at 1.9 GeV instead of 1.5 GeV) for this run,\nwe were unable to tune below 7.4 eV. Nonetheless, we measured the lifetime of fluorescence arising\nfrom the 7.4 eV excitation light to be \u223c320 ms.\nWe also measured the saturation of this fluorescence signal as a function of illumination time.\nDue to the finite closing speed of the pneumatic shutter used to block the ALS beam, the data of\n\n\fFigure 1. Figure of the experimental setup. Fluorescence was collected perpendicular to the ALS\nbeam line via a 2-lens system. The first lens was 75 mm from the crystal. The fluorescence was\nimaged onto the PMT photocathode using a 250 mm lens.\nFig. 3 can only be used to place an upper limit of \u223c250 ms on the saturation rate of the fluorescence.\nThis indicates that longer illumination times will not yield higher VUV-induced background rates.\nFinally, we note that upon inspection of the crystal after illumination, the crystal showed some\nradiation damage due to the VUV exciation beam.\n2.1.2. Th:YLF\nData for this crystal was taken in exactly the same way as the Th:NaYF crystal, and the\nexcitation spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. Here again the data points are the average of 5 repetitions\nat each energy, and the error bars are given by the standard deviation of those points from the\naverage. The fluorescence lifetimes at the peaks of 8 eV, 8.9 eV, and 10 eV were measured to be\n\u223c65 ms, \u223c70 ms and \u223c70 ms, respectively (Table 1).\n\n2.1.3. Th:LiCAF\nThe excitation spectrum for Th:LiCAF is shown in Fig. 5 and was obtained in a similar way\nto the above crystals though the experimental details are slightly different. Here the crystal was\nilluminated for 5 s, but photons were only collected for 5.4 s.

Na2 ThF6\nThis crystal is an interesting option for studies of the isomeric transition because thorium atoms\nare a primary constituent and thus questions about doping efficiency are removed. Furthermore,\nthe shifts and broadenings of the transition in the crystal due to imperfections of the doping process\nmay be reduced. Data for this crystal were taken in the same manner as the previous crystal and\nthe results are shown in Fig. 7. The fluorescence peaks observed at an excitation envery of 7.4 eV\nand 9.6 eV, have both a short and a long timescale component as summarized in Table 2. The\nsignal versus illumination time for each peak was also measured and is shown in Fig. 8.\nAlthough the fluorescence rates are not large enough to pose a concern for using this as a host\ncrystal in these studies, this crystal also exhibited some radiation damage due to the VUV excitation\nlight.\n\n2.1.5. LiSAF\nThe data obtained for this crystal was identical to the runs performed on the Th:LiCAF and\nNa2 ThF6 crystals in the previous sections. The excitation spectrum is shown in Fig. 9. Near the\nexpected isomeric transition energy, this crystal exhibits very little fluorescence, and we therefore\nhave plans to explore it further by growing a 232 Th doped version. The largest peak observed\noccurs at 10.5 eV and the lifetime of the fluorescence was measured to be \u223c500 ms.\n\n\fTable 2. Lifetimes for the fluorescence peaks observed in Na2 ThF6 .

Subsequent measurements of Th:LiCAF\nBased on the synchrotron data we have obtained so far, we have decided to focus on LiCAF as\na host crystal for future studies using 229 Th. In addition to its low VUV-induced background\nfluorescence, LiCAF has several other important properties. It is transparent down to 110 nm and\nhas all electron spins paired. Additionally, 229 Th4+ ions are expected to substitute at the Ca2+ site\n\n\fin LiCAF along with two F\u2212 interstitials for charge compensation [14]. The octahedral symmetry\nof the site minimizes electric field gradient effects.\n\nFigure 10. Results of Rutherford Backscattering measurements of the Th:LiCAF crystal\nfor an unpolished portion of material cut out\nof the bulk. The red boxed region indicates the\namount of material that is removed in polishing.\nWe have also measured a density in excess of 1018 232 Th/cm3 in our Th:LiCAF control crystal\nusing the technique of Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) to interrogate the first \u224820 \u03bcm of the\ncrystal. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 10. The RBS spectra shown are for\nan unpolished facet that we assume was cut from the bulk (t\u0303extiti.e. the facet was not the top of\nthe boule). This facet has a thicker region (modeled as two layers) of higher concentration of Th\ndoping. The first layer has a Th concentration of 1.8% that is 250nm thick. The layer below that\nhas a Th concentration of 0.3% that is 650nm thick. The bulk of the crystal has a concentration\nof \u223c0.07% Th which is similiar to the polished facet (0.05%). The Th doping of the polished facet\nshowed a similar inhomogeneity of Th doping.\nWe have also performed measurements of the fluorescence backgrounds which might arise from\nthe \u03b1-decay of 229 Th (4.8 MeV, \u03c4 = 7880 yr) by bombarding this crystal with a 30 nA, 4.8 MeV beam\nof \u03b1-particles at the Ion Beam Materials Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A total\nfluorescence rate corresponding to 0.3 photons per \u03b1-particle was observed over the unfiltered PMT\nbandwidth (Hamamatsu R7639). Thus, a crystal containing 1018 229 Th nulcei yields a background\nfluorescence rate of 2 MHz which, given the fluorescence rates observed at the ALS, is expected to\nbe the dominant background.\n2.2.1. ALS Th:LiCAF test run\nFinally, we were able to perform a separate run at the ALS when the storage ring was operated\nin the low energy 1.5 GeV mode. As a result, we were able to measure the crystal using the\nexact experimental protocol we plan to use for measuring the isomeric transition. The excitation\nspectrum, which was extended down to 6.0 eV, is shown in Fig. 11. Here the illumination time was\n200 s, the photon collection time was 100 s, and the delay between the two was 5 ms. Only one\ndata point was taken for each energy.\nWith this data, the fluorescence rate measured in our \u03b1-particle bombardment measurements,\nand the expected fluorescence rate from the isomeric transition at the ALS, we have calculated the\nability of our setup to measure the isomeric transition energy depending on the natural lifetime of\nthe transition. The results are plotted in Fig. 12. This graph shows that if the predicted range of\n\n\fSensitivity to\n\n229m\n\nTh Flourescence\n\nTh:LiCAF - Low Energy Exciation Spectrum\n30\n\n0.01\n\n25\n\n[Hz]\n\n1E-3\n\n15\n\nSNR\n\n30:1\n\nSNR\n\n10:1\n\nSNR\n\n3:1\n\n/2\n\nFlourescence rate (kHz)\n\nSNR 100:1\n\n20\n\n1E-4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1E-5\n140\n\n0\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n8.0\n\n8.5\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n9.0\n\n[nm]\nALS Beam Energy (eV)\n\nFigure 11.\nExcitation spectrum of the\nTh:LiCAF crystal across the wider beam energy\nrange allowed by the low energy mode at\nthe ALS.

Summary\nTo summarize, we have characterized VUV-induced fluorescence backgrounds in several candidate\nhost crystals that could be used in a direct search for the 229 Th isomeric transition. While none of\nthe crystals displayed problematic backgrounds, these measurements have shown LiCAF to have\nthe lowest fluorescence rate and shortest fluorescence lifetime overall, as well as a high resilence to\ndamage by the VUV beam. Subsequent measurements have also shown it to have a low \u03b1 particle\ninduced background in the VUV that might arise from the alpha decay of 229 Th inside a LiCAF\nhost crystal. Additionally, a density in excess of 1018 232 Th nuclei/cm3 was measured in our 232 Th\ndoped LiCAF crystal using RBS. Thus, LiCAF appears to be a viable host crystal for 229 Th and a\ndirect search for the isomeric transition.\nAcknowledgments\nThe ALS is supported by the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE \u2212 AC0205CH11231.
