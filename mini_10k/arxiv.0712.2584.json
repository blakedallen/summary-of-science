The characteristics of the microwave bursts produced by beams differ from\nthose in case of isotropic or loss-cone distributions, which suggests a new tool\nfor quantitative diagnostics of the beams in the solar corona.

The burst is remarkably suitable for this goal because of its very short duration, wide frequency\nband and unusual polarization being in the ordinary wave mode in the optically\nthin range of the spectrum. Based on detailed analysis of the spectral, temporal,\nand spatial relationships, we obtained firm evidence that the microwave continuum burst is produced by electron beams.

They ionize and excite hydrogen\natoms in the chromosphere giving rise to optical H\u03b1 flares. They are capable of producing\nnonthermal hard X-ray (HXR) and gamma-ray radiation via the bremsstrahlung mechanism\nas well as of driving the chromospheric evaporation. Then, they can drive various kinetic\ninstabilities in the corona giving rise to a variety of coherent radio emission types widely\nobserved throughout the entire radio band (Aschwanden 2005).\nNevertheless, there is apparent lack of the observational tools now for quantitative diagnostics of the electron beams in the solar atmosphere. Currently, H\u03b1 , HXR, and gamma\nemissions, as well as type III bursts in the radio range are considered to represent signatures\nof electron beams. However, these processes do not offer any reliable straightforward diagnostics of the angular distributions of electron beams. Even though a valuable information of\nthe electron beam properties might in principle be derived from the linear polarization of the\nH\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines in the chromospheric flares (Henoux et al. 2003), the measurement of linear\npolarization in these spectral lines is extremely difficult, so the corresponding beam diagnostic has not been established yet (Bianda et al. 2005). In case of HXR and gamma emission,\nno method has been proposed yet to get the angular distribution of fast electrons from the\ndata. Moreover, many HXR bursts originate from coronal rather than chromospheric sources\n(Veronig & Brown 2004), although even in case of chromospheric sources the HXR emission\ncan originate from a precipitating fraction of approximately isotropic electron distributions\nrather than from beams. Finally, any diagnostics based on the type III bursts is difficult\nbecause for a coherent process the dependence of the output radiation on the electron beam\nproperties is highly nonlinear and difficult to disentangle (Aschwanden 2002). On the other\nhand, the beam can be invisible via the type III emission if it propagates in a dense plasma,\nwhere high collisional damping rate quenches the beam instability and no coherent emission\nis generated. On top of this, the observed fast drift of radio fine structures is not necessarily related to the beam propagation: it can be provided by dynamics of MHD and/or\nreconnection processes as well (Altyntsev et al. 2007), while lower values of the drift rates\ncan be ascribed to emissions originating at thermal conduction fronts (Farnik & Karlicky\n2007). We can conclude that available tools are currently insufficient for reliable detection\nand detailed diagnostics of the beams in the solar corona.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nCuriously, one of the most promising methods of the beam study, namely, analysis of\nthe beam-produced microwave gyrosynchrotron radiation remains entirely unexplored yet,\nalthough the synchrotron radiation by nonthermal electrons has long ago been recognized\nto be the main mechanism producing the microwave emission in solar flares (Ramaty 1969;\nRamaty & Petrosian 1972; Benka & Holman 1992; Bastian, Benz & Gary 1998; Nindos et al.\n2000; Kundu et al. 2001; Trottet et al. 2002; Bastian 2006; Gary 2006; Nindos 2006). Exact expressions for the gyrosynchrotron emission and absorption coefficient (Eidman 1958,\n1959; Ramaty 1969; Ramaty et al. 1994) are cumbersome and difficult for direct use. Thus,\nsignificant efforts have been made to find simple analytical approximations for both the\nsynchrotron emission in the ultrarelativistic case (Ginzburg 1951; Korchak and Terletsky\n1952; Getmantsev 1952; Ginzburg 1953; Korchak 1957; Ginzburg and Syrovatsky 1964)\nand the gyrosynchrotron emission generated by nonrelativistic and moderately relativistic\nelectrons (Dulk & Mursh 1982; Dulk 1985; Zhou, Huang & Wang 1999). Also, simplified\nnumerically fast computation schemes were developed (Petrosian 1981; Klein 1987). All\nthese studies, however, assumed isotropic electron distributions or only weakly anisotropic\nin some cases. These approximations are evidently insufficient to describe and analyze the\nbeam-produced gyrosynchrotron emission, where the pitch-angle anisotropy is expected to\nbe strong.\nRecently, Fleishman and Melnikov (2003) discovered significant effect of the pitch-angle\nanisotropy on the gyrosynchrotron spectrum and polarization. So far (see for a review\nFleishman 2006), analysis of the microwave continuum bursts provided ample evidence for\nthe loss-cone particle distribution formed due to trapping of the accelerated electrons in\nthe coronal magnetic loops (Melnikov et al. 2002a; Melnikov 2006; Fleishman et al. 2003,\n2007). In contrast, here we present a different class of events, when there is a beam-like\nanisotropy of the particle distribution.\nIn case of the beam-like angular distributions of the fast electrons, in particular, the\nhigh-frequency spectral index depends noticeably on the anisotropy and the angle of view in\naddition to the standard dependence on the energy distribution. The degree of polarization\ncan differ strongly from that in the isotropic case. Remarkably, the sense of polarization can\ncorrespond to the ordinary wave mode (O-mode) in the optically thin range of the spectrum\nin contrast to X-mode polarization in the isotropic case (Fleishman and Melnikov 2003).\nThus, the beam-like anisotropy when present must be properly taken into account for\ncorrect modeling the solar microwave continuum bursts, which is especially important to\ninterpret the polarization spectra. The goal of our study is to identify an example of the\nmicrowave burst in which the presence of electron beams is likely and then evaluate the\nproperties of the pitch-angle distribution and possibly other relevant parameters of the source\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfrom the forward fitting of the gyrosynchrotron formulae to the observed radio data.\nThe guess criteria for the candidates to the beam-produced microwave bursts are the\npresence of either short (of the order of second) broadband pulses or type III like drifting\nbursts at lower frequencies or both. Among many burst-candidates we eventually selected\nthe event of 10 March, 2001. This selection is based on fortuitous combination of radio\nobservations of this burst made by different observatories as well as availability of other\nimportant context observations for this event.\nBelow we describe the key observational characteristics of the event, then suggest semiquantitative interpretation of the data, then describe a specially developed nonlinear chisquare minimization fit and apply it simultaneously to total power and polarization spectra.\nEventually, the fitting yields the parameters of the angular distribution of the radiating\nelectrons, the viewing angle of the emission, and the characteristic life time of the electrons\nat the radio source.\n\n2.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nThe event was observed by a number of radio instruments.\nThe Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP) (Torii et al. 1979; Nakajima et al. 1985)\nmeasure the total power and circularly polarized intensities (Stokes parameters I and V) at\n1, 2, 3.75, 9.4, 17, 35, and 80 (Stokes I only) GHz with time resolution as high as 0.1 s.\nWe applied corrections provided by the Nobeyama team for the polarization data at 1 and\n2 GHz and the intensity data at 80 GHz available at the Nobeyama Observatory Internet\narchives.\nChinese Solar broadband Radio Spectrometers (SRS, Fu et al. 2004) measure total flux\nand polarized flux at frequencies 5.2-7.6 GHz with 20 MHz spectral and 5 ms temporal\nresolution (NAOC, Huairou station), and the total flux at frequencies 4.5-7.5 GHz with\n10 MHz spectral and 5 ms temporal resolution (Purple Mountain Observatory, PMO).\nThe Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) (Nakajima et al. 1994) obtains images of the\nSun at 17 GHz (Stokes I and V) and 34 GHz (Stokes I) with 0.1 s temporal resolution. At\nthe time of the burst the angular resolution of the NoRH was 17 arc sec at 17 GHz and\n10 arc sec at 34 GHz.\nFortuitously, the data from another big imaging Siberian Solar Radio Telescope (SSRT)\n(Smolkov et al. 1986; Grechnev et al. 2003) are available for this burst. SSRT yields 1D\nbrightness distributions at 5.7 GHz with 14 ms temporal resolution. During observation\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof this burst, the knife-edge beam of north-south linear array (SSRT/NS) was directed at\n43.53 degree from the central solar meridian (angular resolution of 24 arc sec). The east-west\narray (SSRT/EW) knife-edge beam was directed at \u221223.61 degree angle from the central\nsolar meridian with the angular width of 16.5 arc sec.\nHXR observations made at Yohkoh satellite by Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) at four\nenergy bands (L-band, 14-23 keV; M1-band, 23-33 keV; M2-band, 33-53 keV; H-band, 5393 keV) and Wide-Band Spectrometer (WBS) (Yoshimori et al. 1992) at the high-energy\nband (80-600 keV) and low-energy band (20-80 keV) are available.\nAdditionally, context data of the SOHO/MDI magnetic field and SOHO/EIT are available for the flare.\n\n3.\n\nObservations\n\nImpulsive flare (10 March 2001, M6.7/1B) has occurred in active region AR9368 (N27W42).\nNoRP recorded an intense microwave burst at all frequency channels (Figure 1, left panel).\nThe light curves throughout all those frequencies except 1 GHz display a very short (about\n3 s duration) broadband peak at 04:03:39.6 UT. The pulse magnitudes were exceptionally\nstrong in the range 9.4 \u2013 35 GHz (> 1000 sfu).\nAnalysis of this flare at different wavelengths, viz., H\u03b1 , HXR, SXR and radio waves\nwas published in a number of papers. Ding et al. (2003) and Ding (2003) have classified\nthis flare as a white-light flare. From a good time correlation of H\u03b1 and Ca II 8542 \u00c5\nbrightenings with the peak of the microwave radio flux, they concluded that the response in\noptical emission is due to chromosphere heating by an electron beam. Uddin et al. (2004)\nand Chandra et al. (2006) studied evolution of the flare active region and associated this\nflare with small positive polarity region emerging near the following negative sunspot. They\ndistinguished two bright H\u03b1 kernels connected by a dense plasma loop with distance of about\n104 km between the footpoints.\n\n3.1.\n\nTemporal characteristics\n\nThe entire burst duration is rather short (\u223c 40 s) at frequencies above 3.75 GHz. The\ntime profiles are remarkably similar to each other and the duration of the prominent peak\nwas the same throughout the entire spectral range. The light curves at 9.4\u201380 GHz peaks at\nthe same time, while that at 3.75 GHz is delayed by a fraction of second and that at 2 GHz is\ndelayed even stronger (by half of second). Interestingly that the decay time becomes slightly\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nlarger at low frequencies.\nThe NoRP time profiles of the circularly polarized radiation (Stokes V) are shown in\nFigure 1 (right panel). Except 35 GHz, the profiles of the polarized fluxes differ essentially\nfrom the profiles in intensity. The degree of polarization varies from +10% at 1 GHz down\nto \u221210% at 35 GHz. The main peak is clearly distinguished at 3.75, 9.4, and 35 GHz. Note\nthat across the NoRP spectrum, the right-handed circular polarization gives way to the lefthanded one somewhere between 3.75 GHz and 9.4 GHz. Analysis of the SRS data at the\nrange 5.2-7.6 GHz shows that this polarization reversal occurs around 6.5 GHz.\nIn the dynamic spectrum (Figure 2, top) the NoRP data are complemented by the SRS\nprofiles at 5.4 GHz and 7.4 GHz to fill large gap between the NoRP receiving frequencies\n3.75 GHz and 9.4 GHz. The shape of the microwave spectrum does not change much during\nthe burst that is visualized by similarity of the contours of equal intensity shown in the\ndynamic spectrum (Figure 2, top). The time profiles in Figure 1 show a number of pulses\nbesides the main peak. They are clearly seen in the time derivative of the dynamic spectrum\n(Figure 2, bottom).\nTime derivative of dynamic spectrum (Figure 2, bottom) shows wide band fine structures\nduring the entire bursts. Bright strips correspond to increase of the emission, while the dark\nones show emission decrease. The duration of the shortest strips is comparable with the\nNoRP temporal resolution (0.1 s), and there bandwidth covers the entire spectral range\nfrom 1 GHz to 80 GHz in some cases. The strips are not noise or interference since they are\nwider than several frequency channels including data from different observatories. Note that\nmost of the broadband pulses display no frequency drifts, although any drift value within\n\u00b1800 GHz/s is measurable with given time resolution (0.1 s) and spectral bandwidth (80\nGHz) of the pulses. The duration of decay phases (the dark strips after the bright ones)\ndoes not depend on the frequency.\nAt millisecond time scale there are pulses with reverse and normal frequency drift\nobserved in the dynamic spectrum in interval within 04:03:37 \u2013 04:03:56 UT, some of them\nare shown in Figure 4. The total bandwidth of the fine structures does not exceed 0.5 GHz\nand the life time is about 50 ms. The corresponding drift rates are within 10 \u2212 15 GHz/s\nin this event. The characteristic frequency of the fine structures rises from 4.5 GHz up to\n7 GHz during this interval.\nTime profiles of the hard X-ray emission are remarkably similar to the microwave profiles\n(Figure 3). The same profiles were observed with the Wide-Band Spectrometer at the highenergy band (80-600 keV). Note, that HXR emission is delayed relative to the radio emission.\nThe overall L signal delays relative to various radio frequencies by about 1-2 s, although the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndelay between the impulsive peaks occurring at about 04:03:40 UT is shorter than 1 s. At\nhigher energies the delays are shorter being a fraction of second. In particular, the cross\ncorrelation between the H channel and 35 GHz light curve yields the delay of 0.5 s with the\ncorrelation coefficient equal to 0.8.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpatial characteristics\n\nThe flare spatial structure in H\u03b1 emission was studied by Uddin et al. (2004) and\nChandra et al. (2006). Before the flare, emerging flux of N polarity had penetrated into\nthe S polarity region and triggered the flare. From the spatial correlation between different\nwaveband sources it was concluded that the flare had the three-legged structure, i.e., it may\nbe considered to be one of the typical configuration of loops as determined earlier by Hanaoka\n(1996). The H\u03b1 flare began (around 04:01 UT) as two bright kernels (K1 and K2), which\nrapidly transformed during the flare peak into a bright region expanding in the southwest\ndirection. A short loop connecting magnetic regions of opposite polarity is seen in 195 \u00c5\nemission (Figure 5); its length is about 104 km. One more source (so called remote source,\nRS) appeared after 04:03:51 UT at 17 GHz. The RS was located 150 arcsec southwest from\nthe main flare site (Figure 5) and had right handed polarization; the presence of the RS is\nconfirmed by a secondary peak at 280 arc sec in the 5.7 GHz SSRT/NS scan at 04:04:21 UT\n(Figure 6, middle), which is unpolarized, however, at this relatively low frequency.\nThe footpoints of the loop are seen in the 17 GHz polarization images during the late\ndecay phase of the burst (Figure 7, right panel). The shown maps are the result of averaging\nof the emission over more than a minute. The averaging is made since the brightness temperature of right handed emission was rather weak. In the main phase of the burst the bulk\nof microwave emission is generated in the source K2 with the north polarity of magnetic\nfield, and it is left hand polarized. This means that the microwave source K2 is polarized in\nthe ordinary wave mode. The magnetic field near the footpoints can be estimated from the\nMDI magnetogram as \u2212170 G (K1) and 340 G (K2).\nThe spatial behavior of the HXT emission is studied by Chandra et al. (2006) in detail.\nIn all energy bands only single source was observed. The estimated size of the HXR source\nwas 7.0 \u00d7 3.8, 6.7 \u00d7 3.3, 6.5 \u00d7 3.3 and 6.2 \u00d7 3.2 arc sec in L, M1, M2, and H energy bands\nrespectively. According to Figure 6 in Chandra et al. (2006) the HXR source is located\nnear source K1. Note that the situation when the brightness peaks in the hard X-ray and\nthe microwaves are located in the opposite ends of a single loop is typical for asymmetric\nmagnetic loops.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe SSRT 1d images are shown in Figure 6. The vertical lines correspond to the\nintegration paths crossing the centers of the two-dimensional brightness distribution at 17\nGHz; these integration paths are shown by dash-dotted lines for both EW and NS linear\narrays in Figure 5. The microwave source position did not change in the NS scans, while\nslightly shifts to the West in the EW scans at the burst peak. The sources K1 and K2 are not\nresolved in the SSRT scans. The size of the 5.7 GHz microwave source is about 50 arc sec in\nthe NS scans and 25 arc sec in the EW scans. On the contrary the polarization distributions\nare radically changing with time. At the burst peak the polarization sense changes from the\nleft handed to the right handed polarization and then back in the NS scans. In the EW\nscans a two-polarity structure appeared in the time interval around the burst peak.\n\n3.3.\n\nSpectrum description\n\nThe microwave spectra are shown in Figure 8 at three moments corresponding to the\nmain peak and neighboring peaks. The spectra are similar to each other. At low frequencies\nthe spectra increase with index \u03b3 \u2243 1.9. Spectral peak is at about 17 GHz. At high\nfrequencies the spectrum decreases rather quickly with the high-frequency spectral index\n\u03b3 \u2243 \u22122.1.\nThe hard X-ray spectrum I(E) was studied by Chandra et al. (2006) using the Yohkoh\\HXT\n\u2212\u03b3\n\u22122.4\ndata. At the peak time they obtained I(E) = Fo Eph\n= 2.02 \u00d7 105 Eph\nphotons * cm\u22122 *\ns\u22121 * keV\u22121 . Assuming the electron spectrum in the form Fel (E) = AE \u2212\u03b4 electrons/s we\nget the parameters of electron flux under the thick-target assumption as follows, by making\nnecessary corrections for the equation given by Brown (1971):\nA = 5.2 \u00d7 1033 \u03b3 2 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)2 B(\u03b3 \u2212 0.5, 1.5)Fo = 5.1 \u00d7 1039\n\n(1)\n\nand \u03b4 = \u03b3 + 1 = 3.4, where E is expressed in keV.\n\n3.4.\n\nSummary of observations\n\nHere we summarize main observational characteristics of the event important for further\nanalysis:\n1. The microwave emission in the 10 March 2001 event consists of many short broadband\npulses.\n2. Type III like features are observed around 5 GHz.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3. The microwave emission is O-mode polarized at 17 GHz.\n4. The polarization at 5.7 GHz displays high variability and corresponds to X-mode at\nthe peak time.\n5. HXR light curves are remarkably similar to the microwave light curves.\n6. HXR is delayed by a fraction of second compared with the microwave emission.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nModel\n\nGeneral trends and model dependences\n\nOur goal in the analysis of the microwave emission is to derive important source parameters from forward fitting of the observed radio spectra by the gyrosynchrotron formulae.\nHowever, as is widely known (e.g., Bastian et al. 2007) the gyrosynchrotron emission depends\non too many physical effects and parameters even if angular distribution of fast electrons is\nisotropic. Expected presence of the beam-like anisotropy of fast electrons adds a few new\nfree parameters, which complicates further the procedure of the fitting. Therefore, before\ndeveloping a specific forward fitting model dealing with gyrosynchrotron emission produced\nby electron beams, we critically evaluate the observed properties of the burst to restrict or\nfix as many parameters as possible.\nFirst of all, we make use of the close similarity of the radio and HXR light curves. This\nsimilarity suggests that no trapping effect is important for this event and both HXR and\nmicrowave emissions are produced by the same electron distribution. The peak injection rate\nof the electrons above 10 keV derived from the HXR spectrum is J(> 10 keV) \u2243 8.5 * 1036\nelectrons/sec. We adopt that the total number of the emitting electrons in the radio source\nis Ntot = \u03c4l J(> 10 keV), where \u03c4l is the characteristic life time of the emitting electrons\nin the radio source. Since no trapping is important, we adopt that \u03c4l is a single, energyindependent, free parameter, which will be determined later from the forward fitting model.\nIt is clear, however, that \u03c4l must not exceed a few seconds, the typical duration of the\nsingle pulses composing the burst. Then, regarding the energy dependence of the electron\ndistribution, we adopt the simplest assumption of a single power-law over the momentum\nmodulus with the spectral index determined from the HXR spectrum (note, the energetic\nspectral index of 3.4 corresponds to the index of 7.8 in the distribution over momentum).\nSecond, address the question what can cause the delay of the HXRs relative to microwave\nemission. If the electron beam is injected somewhere at the top of the loop towards the foot\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\npoints, then directly precipitating electrons will first produce the HXR and a fraction of the\nelectrons reflected back into the loop will later produce the radio emission. Thus, the model\ninvolving directly precipitating beam predicts opposite delay (HXR leads radio) to what is\nactually observed. Note, that models with electron trapping also predict a delay of radio\nemission relative to HXR emission (Melnikov 1994).\nThe only transport model allowing radio to lead HXR is a 'single reflection' model,\nwhich is adopted below. Specifically, if a particle beam with some angular scatter is injected\nat a asymmetric magnetic trap towards a foot-point with stronger magnetic field, most of\nthe electrons can be reflected back to form a hollow beam, produce gyrosynchrotron emission\nin the region of relatively strong magnetic field, and then after corresponding travel time\nover the loop reach the other foot point with weaker magnetic field to penetrate deeper into\nthe chromosphere and produce HXRs. In this case the observed delay between radio and\nHXR originates naturally. In addition, the presence of initially downward injected beam is\nconfirmed by the reverse drifting coherent subbursts (Figure 4) leading both microwave and\nHXR peaks by a fraction of second.\nIn our event the formation of a asymmetric loop is likely because the photospheric\nmagnetic field has the extremes of \u2212170 G and +340 G at the flare kernels K1 and K2\nrespectively. This means that the magnetic field in the radio source should belong to the\nrange +170 G < B < +340 G. Indeed, if the regions of weaker magnetic field provided\nnoticeable radio emission, then the trapping of the particles between \u2212170 G and 170 G\nloop layers were important, which is not observed.\nThird, the information about the largest possible value of the magnetic field at the\nsource allows to make a firm conclusion about possible role of the gyrosynchrotron selfabsorption in the event. This question is important because the low-frequency slope of the\nspectrum (\u03b3 = 1.9) is consistent with that expected for the optically thick gyrosynchtotron\nradiation (Dulk 1985). However, with the given magnetic field range and the given electron\ndistribution it is impossible to ensure the spectral peak at about 17 GHz (as observed) by\nthe self-absorption effect unless the source is extremely compact, with the linear scale less\nthan 700 km. In this case, however, the number density of the fast electrons will exceed 1012\ncm\u22123 , which we believe is not realistic. Thus, we adopted the typical angular scale of the\nsource to be 6\" consistent with imaging observations of the radio source.\nAlternatively, a large value of the microwave spectral peak frequency can be provided\nby Razin effect, which requires high plasma density at the radio source. Indeed, the presence\nof high plasma density at the source is likely because we observe type III like drifting bursts\naround 5 GHz (Figure 4). Accordingly, we adopt the background plasma density to be\nne = 3 * 1011 cm\u22123 .\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThis estimate agrees with the value of the emission measure determined from the soft X-ray\nemission (Uddin et al. 2004).\nIn such a dense plasma the Razin-effect is strong for the entire range of the magnetic\nfield 170 \u2212 340 G. In conditions of strong Razin effect the low-frequency slope of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum in the uniform source is much steeper than one observed. We must,\ntherefore, conclude that the low-frequency slope of the spectrum is eventually formed by\nthe source inhomogeneity, i.e., by different layers with the magnetic field ranging from 170\nG to 340 G in the region of kernel K2. In such a dense plasma the free-free absorption is\ntypically important throughout the microwave range (Bastian et al. 2007). However, high\nplasma temperature of about 3*107K was determined for this event from the soft X-ray data\n(Uddin et al. 2004), therefore, the free-free optical depth is less than unity at f > 7 GHz.\nThus, we will not take into account the free-free absorption in our analysis.\nWe note that the spectral peak provided by the Razin effect increases as the magnetic\nfield decreases. This means, in particular, that lower-frequency emission should arise lower\nin the loop, in contrast to usual situation when higher-frequency sources are located lower\nin the corona. We checked that the position of the brightness peak at 17 GHz is indeed\ndisplaced southwest by about 5\" relative to the 34 GHz brightness peak in agreement with\nthe prediction made. Therefore, the high-frequency emission should arise from the region of\nthe lowest possible magnetic field, thus, we adopt\nB = 180 G\n\n(3)\n\nconsistent with the requirement B > 170 G. Now, when most of the source parameters\nare fixed based on straightforward use of various observational indicators, we can turn to\nformulating the forward fitting model.\n\n4.2.\n\nForward fitting scheme\n\nEven though there are many individual measurements of the radio emission produced\nby the considered event, we can make use of only a minor fraction of them. Indeed, since\nthe low-frequency part of the spectrum is related to the inhomogeneity of the source, which\ncannot be reliably constrained by the observations, we can only model the high-frequency\npart of the radio spectrum by the uniform source (which we refer to as 'high-frequency\nsource').\nSpecifically, we adopt that the high-frequency source is entirely responsible for the\nemission at 80 GHz and 35 GHz and for a significant fraction of the emission at 17 GHz.\nTherefore, we have at best five different observational data points (Stokes I and V at 17 GHz\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nand 35 GHz and Stokes I at 80 GHz), which may allow for finding four free parameters or\nless. It is clear, that the weights of the measurements are different from each other: the\nhighest weight is given to measurements at 35 GHz (5% error in the intensity, and 10% error\nin polarization) as they have a small experimental error and should be well described by the\nuniform source model. The 80 GHz intensity has lower weight (while it should be described\nby the uniform model even better that the 35 GHz data, the 80 GHz intensity is measured\nwith 40% error). The experimental error at 17 GHz is small, however, the effect of source\ninhomogeneity becomes important. Thus, we adopt that the high-frequency source provides\n70% of the observed flux at 17 GHz with error of 40%; the error of 100% in the degree of\npolarization at 17 GHz is adopted.\nIn previous subsection we mentioned already that one of the free parameters we determine from the fitting is the characteristic life time \u03c4l of the emitting electrons at the\nradio source. Another important parameter, which is not known from the observations, is\nthe viewing angle \u03b8 between the line of sight and the direction of the magnetic field at the\nsource, so the viewing angle is the second free parameter in the forward fitting scheme. Thus,\nwe have to use a test function for the angular part of the electron distribution, which depends\non only one or two free parameters. Our model involving one reflection of the electrons from\nthe magnetic mirror cannot be described by a function with a single free parameter: it must\ninclude both the direction where the angular distribution reaches the maximum, which differs from the direction along the field lines after the reflection, and typical angular scatter of\nthe distribution. Thus, a test function with two free parameters is necessary. As a simplest\napproximation we adopt a normalized gaussian angular distribution over the cosine of the\npitch-angle with unknown mean and dispersion:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc0 )2\nf2 (\u03bc) \u221d exp \u2212\n.\n(4)\n\u2206\u03bc2\nThen, we apply a nonlinear code that adjusts model free parameters to minimize the\n\u03c7 statistics using the downhill simplex method (Press et al. 1986). The \u03c72 statistics is\ncalculated as\nN\nX\n(Siobs \u2212 Simod )2\n,\n(5)\n\u03c72 =\n2\n\u03c3\ni\ni=1\n2\n\nwhere Siobs are the observational data of either Stokes I or V for the selected three frequencies,\n\u03c3i are defined by the errors introduced above, Simod are the model values of the intensity and\npolarization.\nOur current forward fitting scheme is different from the scheme applied previously\n(Bastian et al. 2007) in two instances. First of all, minimizing the \u03c72 statistics we employ both intensity and polarization data simultaneously in the same run, which is the first\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nexample when the polarization data is used for quantitative diagnostics of the fast electron\ndistribution. And then, our model function is the exact expression of the gyrosynchrotron\nemission including the summation over the series of the Bessel functions and their derivatives. Because the magnetic field at the source is somewhat low, the contribution of large\nharmonics is important at high frequencies, therefore, we had to use the sum over 1600\nterms of the series to describe the emission correctly up to 80 GHz. This made our scheme\ncomputationally expensive: the full run with one spectrum took about 50 hours of the PC\nwith 2.1 GHz processor.\n\n4.3.\n\nForward fitting results\n\nGiven that the observed spectrum does not evolve much during the burst, while the\nforward fitting scheme employing exact gyrosynchrotron equations is very time consuming,\nwe concentrated on study of the emission at the peak time of the burst (04:03:40 UT) only.\nResult of the fitting is shown in Figure 8. A number of important things should be noticed\nin the figure. First, the model radio spectra (top left panel) obtained for the electron energy\nspectrum derived from HXR data are good match for the observed high-frequency part of the\nradio spectra. Thus, the data is consistent with the model assumption of a single power-law\nelectron spectrum in the event. Second, the curves for the degree of polarization are very\nsensitive to the details of the electron angular distribution. In particular, the polarization\ndata is entirely inconsistent with isotropic angular distribution of the fast electrons, since\nthe isotropic distribution would produce X-mode polarized emission, while the observed\npolarization corresponds to O-mode emission. The gyrosynchrotron radiation produced by\noblique beam observed by quasitransverse direction is O-mode polarized as needed. The\nexact value of the degree of polarization depends strongly on the details of the pitch-angle\ndistribution, thus, the joint use of the intensity and polarization measurements is indeed a\nkey to constrain the angular distribution of the electron beam. For the peak time of the burst\nthe following parameters provide the best fit to the observed spectrum and polarization:\n\u03c4l = 0.45 s,\n\n\u03b8 = 80o ,\n\n\u03bc0 = 0.5,\n\n\u2206\u03bc = 0.35.\n\n(6)\n\nAll these numbers look reasonable against observations and theory of gyrosynchrotron\nradiation from anisotropic electron distribution. Indeed, the life-time of the fast electrons\nis small enough, \u03c4l \u2248 0.45 s, i.e., less than the radio peak duration as required. Then, as\nis known from the gyrosynchrotron theory, the O-mode polarization of the optically thin\nsource is only possible for beam-like electron distributions and for viewing angles larger than\nthe peak angle in the pitch-angle distribution. The obtained values of \u03b8 and \u03bc0 obey these\nrequirements since cos \u03b8 = 0.16 < \u03bc0 .\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nIt is tempting now to subtract the model contribution of the high-frequency source\nfrom the observational data points and repeat the forward fitting procedure. Indeed, we\ncan perform a reasonable fit to the total power data. As an example, a contribution of a\n\"lower-frequency source\" with the same pitch-angle distribution but with stronger magnetic\nfield (B \u2248 300 G), while smaller life-time of the fast electrons (\u03c4l \u2248 0.05 s) is shown in the\nfigure.\nHowever, it is not possible to perform a consistent fit to the polarization measurements,\nwhich is the key to constrain the electron angular distribution, because the observed degree\nof polarization is essentially the result of averaging of various contributions along the nonuniform source. This conclusion is in agreement with high spatial and temporal variability of\nthe polarization patterns observed at 5.7 GHz, which is most probably a result of changing\nrelative contributions from different parts of an inhomogeneous source (note a very strong\nfrequency dependence of the degree of polarization in the model curves below 10 GHz in\nFigure 8). Therefore, the low-frequency observations cannot be conclusively fitted by the\nuniform source model.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we presented a new tool of studying electron beams accelerated during solar\nflares by analysis of the gyrosynchrotron emission produced by the beams. Methodologically,\nthis result is achieved by quantitative use of the polarization measurements of the microwave\ngyrosynchrotron emission. Specifically, to obtain the information of the beam-like angular\ndistribution of the accelerated electrons we developed a nonlinear \u03c72 fit employing Stokes I\n& V measurements simultaneously and exact gyrosynchrotron formulae.\nThis approach allows for unambiguous detection of oblique beams at the radio source.\nIn addition, our scheme yields a number of important physical parameters of the radio burst\nsuch as the viewing angle of the radio emission relative to the magnetic field at the source,\ncharacteristic parameters of the electron distribution over pitch-angle, and typical life time\nof the electrons in the radio source, see Eq. (6).\nThe diagnostics of the electron beam obtained from the fit of the gyrosynchrotron data\nwithin 'one-reflection model' is consistent with all other available observations. In particular,\nthe time delays of the hard X-rays relative to the microwaves (a fraction of second) is\nconsistent with the transit time of the electrons with relatively large pitch-angles (found\nfrom the forward fitting technique) through the flaring loop of about 104 km in projection.\nIn addition, the fine structures consisted of the reverse drift bursts followed by the normal\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ndrift bursts detected at about 5 GHz are in agreement with the 'one-reflection model', which\nimplies the downward beam propagation followed by its reflection at the magnetic mirror\nand consequent upward motion of the beam. The radio data suggest that the main radio\nsource is filled by a rather dense plasma, Eq. (2), with the plasma frequency of about 5 GHz.\nThe radio emission observed at lower frequencies (3.75 and 2 GHz) cannot be produced at\nthis main source. The most straightforward interpretation for this low-frequency component\nis to postulate an adjacent more tenuous loop, where a minor fraction of the accelerated\nelectrons produce lower-frequency radiation. Such a larger loop is likely and confirmed by\nthe presence of a remote source magnetically connected with the main flare site. If so, larger\ndecay constant and the observed delay of the low-frequency emission relative to higherfrequency emission (see \u00a73.1) receives a natural interpretation because it simply relates to\nlarger source size implying longer transit time, where, in addition, some trapping of the\nelectrons can be important.\nAnother possible effect of the dense plasma is an enhanced role of the Coulomb collisions\non the radiating electrons. Given relatively low value of the magnetic field at the source, it\nis easy to estimate the typical energies of the radio emitting electrons as 1 \u2212 10 MeV, which\nhave the Coulomb energy decay time \u03c4c > 15 s, which is much longer than the transit time.\nThe time of isotropization of these relativistic electrons due to Coulomb collisions is even\nlonger than the energy decay time (Petrosian 1985). We, thus, conclude that the Coulomb\ncollisions have very little effect on the electron distribution at the time scale of the electron\nprecipitation (\u223c 1 s) in this event.\nAlthough we quantitatively describe the emission at the burst peak only, we can reliably\nextrapolate the main findings, such as acceleration of the fast electrons in the form of beams\nand the one-reflection transport model to the entire burst duration. It follows from the close\nsimilarity between the radio and the hard X-ray light curves and from the constancy of the\nsense of polarization in the main source at 17 GHz. This means that some of the flares, such\nas one considered here, can predominantly accelerate electrons along the magnetic field lines\neven though the pitch-angle distribution of the beams has some angular scatter.\nThe potentiality of the developed method is very strong and will be especially helpful when imaging spectroscopy data is availably. However, the routine use of this method\nrequires optimization of the computation scheme, which is not fast enough at present. Therefore, deducing simplified, although precise enough, gyrosynchrotron formulae for anisotropic\nelectron distributions can be very helpful here.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nElectron beams with some angular scatter can efficiently produce microwave continuum\nbursts via gyrosynchrotron mechanism. As was shown theoretically by Fleishman and Melnikov\n(2003), the gyrosynchrotron emission produced by electron beams can be distinguished from\nthat produced by isotropic electron populations by analysis of the degree of polarization\nof the microwave emission. Here we presented a compelling example of such event, where\nthe optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation is indeed O-mode polarized as expected for the\nbeam-like distributions. Remarkably, the presence of the beam is confirmed by the whole\nset of the available data for this event.\nIn case of the radio data with good enough quality (including both intensity and polarization) the use of forward fitting inversion methods allows for quantitative diagnostics\nof the fast electron angular distribution as well as a number of other important physical\nparameters of the flaring source. These methods will become much more useful when the\nimaging spectroscopy data is available.\nThe authors express appreciation to Prof. Kiyoto Shibasaki and Prof. Hiroshi Nakajima\nfor the NoRP calibration corrections they provided.

The NoRP measurements are complemented by SRS measurements at 5.4 and 7.4 GHz. Contours:\n2000 \u00d7 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8) sfu. Bottom: The derivatives of the time profiles.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Radio vs Yohkoh/HXT light curves. Energy ranges are L(14 \u2013 23 keV), M1(23\n\u2013 33 keV), M2(33 - 53 keV), H(53 \u2013 93 keV). HXR light curves (dashed) are normalized\nsuch as to match the peak value of the corresponding radio light curves (solid).

Each point in these brightness\ndistributions is a result of integration of the true brightness along a line parallel to the dashdotted EW (EW-scans) or NS (NS-scans) lines shown in Figure 5. Solid profiles correspond\nto the burst peak. Profile magnitudes are in arbitrary units. Vertical dash-dotted lines\ncorrespond to positions marked in the NoRH map in Figure 5 (left). Middle panels show the\nappearance of the unpolarized RS in the NS scans.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Brightness distributions in intensity and polarization at 17 GHz.

Black curve\nshow the results for the isotropic electron distribution all other conditions being equal. Right\ncolumn displays the best fit curves for the high-frequency source (green/solid) supplemented\nby curves for the emission from a secondary source with higher magnetic field and smaller\namount of the fast electrons (blue/dash-dotted curves) all other conditions being equal. This\nsimple two-source model is good enough to describe the total intensity, although insufficient\nto fit the polarization data.\n\n\f"}
