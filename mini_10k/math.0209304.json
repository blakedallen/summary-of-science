We give a class of three-dimensional Stein spaces W together with\na hypersurface H, such that the complement W \u2212 H is not Stein, but such\nthat for every analytic surface S \u2282 W the complement S \u2212 S \u2229 H is Stein. This\nclass is constructed using forcing equations and gives new counter-examples to\nthe hypersection problem.\n\nMathematical Subject Classification (1991): 14J26, 32C25, 32L05, 32E10\n0. Introduction. Let W be a complex Stein space of dimension \u2265 3 and let\nH \u2282 W be an analytic hypersurface, U = W \u2212 H. Suppose that for every analytic\nhypersurface S \u2282 W the intersection U \u2229 S is Stein, is then U itself Stein? This\nquestion is called the hypersection problem, see [2] for a general treatment and\nrelated problems. The first counter-example to this question was given by Coltoiu\nand Diederich in [1], using the affine cone over the complement of two sections on\nsome ruled surface over an elliptic curve. In this way they get a normal threedimensional isolated singularity.\nIn this paper we present another class of three-dimensional Stein spaces W together with a hypersurface H fulfilling the assumptions in the hypersection problem,\nbut not its conclusion. The class is constructed in the following way: we start with\na two-dimensional normal affine cone X over a smooth projective curve and the\nvertex point P \u2208 X. Suppose that we have three homogeneous functions f1 , f2 and\nf0 on X. Then, under suitable conditions, W = V (f1 t1 + f2 t2 + f0 ) \u2282 X \u00d7 C2 and\nthe hypersurface H = p\u22121 (P ) have the desired properties, see Theorem 7. These\nconditions reduce to numerical conditions, which are easily to verify, see Corollary\n8 and Example 9.\n1. Forcing equations. Let X be an irreducible normal complex Stein space of\ndimension d together with a point P \u2208 X. Let f1 , . . . , fn be holomorphic functions\non X such that the common zero set of these functions is exactly P . Let f0 be\nanother holomorphic function vanishing at P . Then we consider the complex space\nW \u2282 X \u00d7 Cn defined by the equation f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn + f0 = 0,\nW = {(x, t1 , . . . , tn ) \u2208 X \u00d7 Cn : f1 (x)t1 + . . . + fn (x)tn + f0 (x) = 0} .\nThe equation f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn + f0 = 0 is called a forcing equation, since it forces\nf0 to lie in the ideal generated by f1 , . . . , fn . Forcing equations and the algebras\ndefined by them play an important role in the theory of closure operations for ideals,\ne.g. tight closure and solid closure, see [5]. Let p : W \u2192 X be the projection. If\nd \u2265 2, then n \u2265 2 and W is an irreducible\nSn Stein space of dimension d + n \u2212 1. Let\nUi = {x \u2208 X : fi (x) 6= 0} and U = i=1 Ui = X \u2212 P . Resolving ti shows that\np\u22121 (Ui ) \u223c\n= Ui \u00d7 Cn\u22121 . The transition mappings however are only affine-linear, not\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nlinear, hence W |U is not a vector bundle. H := p\u22121 (P ) \u223c\n= Cn is a closed subset in\nW , which is a hypersurface in case d = 2. The existence of a section X \u2192 W is\nequivalent with f0 \u2208 (f1 , . . . , fn ) over X.\nLemma 1. Let X be a normal irreducible Stein space together with a point P and\nlet f1 , . . . , fn , f0 \u2208 \u0393(X, OX ) be holomorphic functions on X. Let X \u2032 be another\nirreducible Stein space of the same dimension and let \u03c8 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a holomorphic\nmapping such that \u03c8 \u22121 (P ) contains isolated points. Suppose that f0 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u2208 (f1 \u25e6\n\u03c8, . . . , fn \u25e6 \u03c8) in \u0393(X \u2032 , OX \u2032 ). Then f0 \u2208 (f1 , . . . , fn ) in OX,P .\nProof. Let Q be an isolated point over P . Then there exist open neighborhoods\nQ \u2208 U and P \u2208 V such that \u03c8 : U \u2192 V is finite, see [4], Ch. 3.2. Due to the\nfinite mapping theorem, \u03c8\u2217 (OX \u2032 ) is a coherent analytic algebra on P \u2208 V \u2286 X.\nFurthermore it is torsionfree due to the assumptions on the dimension. Since X is\nnormal, we have the trace map tr : \u03c8\u2217 (OU ) \u2192 OV , which gives the result.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2. Let X be a normal irreducible Stein space of dimension d together\nwith a point P and let f1 , . . . , fn , f0 \u2208 \u0393(X, OX ) be holomorphic functions such that\nf0 6\u2208 (f1 , . . . , fn )OP . Let\np\n\nW = V (f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn + f0 ) \u2282 X \u00d7 Cn \u2212\u2192 X .\nand H = p\u22121 (P ). Let T be an irreducible complex space of dimension d and let\n\u03c6 : T \u2192 W be a holomorphic map. Then \u03c6\u22121 (H) \u2282 T contains no isolated points\nand the codimension of \u03c6\u22121 (H) is \u2264 d \u2212 1.\n\u03c6\n\np\n\nProof. We look at the composed mapping \u03c8 = p \u25e6 \u03c6 : T \u2192 W \u2192 X. Since it factors\nthrough W it follows that f0 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u2208 (f1 \u25e6 \u03c8, . . . , fn \u25e6 \u03c8) in \u0393(T, OT ). Due to the\nLemma \u03c8 \u22121 (P ) = \u03c6\u22121 (H) cannot contain isolated points.\n\u0003\nWith this result we can establish the hypothesis of the hypersection problem in\na broad class of example where the base space X is two-dimensional, n = 2 and\nH = p\u22121 (P ) \u223c\n= C2 is a hypersurface in three-dimensional W .\nProposition 3. Let X be a normal irreducible two-dimensional Stein space together\nwith a point P . Let f1 , f2 , f0 \u2208 \u0393(X, OX ) be holomorphic functions such that\nP = {f1 = f2 = 0} and suppose that f0 6\u2208 (f1 , f2 )OP . Let\np\n\nW = Z(f1 t1 + f2 t2 + f0 ) \u2282 X \u00d7 C2 \u2212\u2192 X .\nand let H = p\u22121 (P ) \u2282 W . Then for every analytic surface S \u2282 W the complement\nof S \u2229 H \u2282 S is Stein.\nProof. We may assume that S is irreducible, let S\u0303 be its normalization and let\n\u03c6 : S\u0303 \u2192 W be the corresponding mapping. Due to Cor. 2 we know that \u03c6\u22121 (H) \u2282\nS\u0303 contains no isolated points. Hence \u03c6\u22121 (H) is a pure curve on a normal Stein\nsurface and due to [7] its complement is Stein. But then also S \u2212 S \u2229 H itself is\nStein.\n\u0003\n2. The graded situation. We have to look for examples of the type described\nin Proposition 3 where W \u2212 H is not Stein. To this end we look at the graded\nsituation. Let Y \u2286 PN be a smooth projective variety with the very ample line\nbundle HY \u2192 Y (which is the restriction of OPN (1) to Y ) and let X \u2286 CN +1 be\nthe corresponding affine cone. Let P be the vertex of the cone and assume that X\nis normal. Recall that we have an action of C\u2217 on X, which is free on U = X \u2212 P .\n\n\f3\n\nY is the quotient of this action and U \u2192 Y is a C\u2217 -principal bundle. A number\ne \u2208 Z defines the action on X \u00d7 C by \u03bb(x, t) := (\u03bbx, \u03bbe t), this action is free over U\nand the quotient is the line bundle HYe \u2192 Y .\nSuppose that the holomorphic functions fi are homogeneous of degree di , i.e.\nfi (\u03bbx) = \u03bbdi f (x), x \u2208 X, \u03bb \u2208 C\u2217 . We may consider a homogeneous holomorphic\nfunction f of degree d as a section Y \u2192 HYd and as a mapping of line bundles\nHY\u2212d \u2192 Y \u00d7 C or HYe \u2192 HYe+d .\nProposition 4. Let X be a normal affine cone over a smooth projective variety Y\nand let P be the vertex point. Let f1 , . . . , fn be homogeneous functions such that\nP = {f1 = . . . = fn = 0}, U = X \u2212 P . Let di be the degrees of fi and let ei numbers\nsuch that m = di + ei is constant. Then the following hold.\n(i) There is an exact sequence of vector bundles\nP\nfi\n0 \u2212\u2192 Vm \u2212\u2192 HYe1 \u00d7Y . . . \u00d7Y HYen \u2212\u2192 HYm \u2212\u2192 0 .\n(ii) Vm is the quotient of V (f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn )|U by the action of C\u2217 given by\ntn ).\n\u03bb(x, t1 , . . . , tn ) = (\u03bbx, \u03bbe1 t1 , . . . , \u03bbenP\nPn\nn\n(iii) We have Det Vm \u223c\n= HYk , where k = i=1 ei \u2212 m = \u2212 i=1 di + (n \u2212 1)m.\n\u2032\n(m \u2212m)\n. The projective bundle P(Vm ) is independent of the\n(iv) Vm\u2032 = Vm \u2297 HY\nchoosen degree m.\nProof. (i). We consider the fiPas morphisms HYei \u2192 HYm . The morphism of vector\nfi\nbundles HYe1 \u00d7Y . . . \u00d7Y HYen \u2192 HYm over Y is surjective, because the fi do not\nhave a common zero on Y . Hence the kernel is a vector bundle Vm on Y of rank\nn \u2212 1.\n(ii). The pull back under q : U \u2192 Y of the exact sequence in (i) gives\nP\nfi\n\u2217\nn\n0 \u2212\u2192 q Vm \u2212\u2192 U \u00d7 C \u2212\u2192 U \u00d7 C \u2212\u2192 0\ntogether with the described action, and q \u2217 Vm = V (f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn )|U . (iii) and\n(iv) follow.\n\u0003\nProposition 5. Let X be a normal affine cone over a smooth projective variety\nY and let P be the vertex point, U = X \u2212 P . Let f1 , . . . , fn be homogeneous\nfunctions such that P = {f1 = . . . = fn = 0}. Let f0 be another homogeneous\nfunction, di = deg(fi ), and let ei be numbers such that m = di + ei is constant for\ni = 0, . . . , n. Let Vm (resp. Vm\u2032 ) be the vector bundle on Y defined in Proposition 4\nwith respect to f1 , . . . , fn (resp. f0 , . . . , fn ). Then the following hold.\n(i) There is an exact sequence of vector bundles on Y :\nt\n\n0\nHYe0 \u2212\u2192 0 .\n0 \u2212\u2192 Vm \u2212\u2192 Vm\u2032 \u2212\u2192\n\n(ii) The corresponding embedding P(Vm ) \u0592\u2192 P(Vm\u2032 ) is independent of m, P(Vm )\nis a divisor on P(Vm\u2032 ).\n(iii) Let e0 = 0. The normal bundle for P(V ) \u0592\u2192 P(V \u2032 ) on P(V ) is HP(V ) , where\nHP(V ) denotes the relative very ample line bundle on P(V ).\n(iv) Let e0 = 0. W |U \u2212\u2192 P(V \u2032 ) \u2212 P(V ) is a quotient of the action on W =\nV (f1 t1 + . . . + fn tn + f0 ) given by\n\u03bb(x, t1 , . . . , tn ) 7\u2192 (\u03bbx, \u03bbe1 t1 , . . . , \u03bben tn ) .\n\n\f4\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProof. (i). The mappings in the sequence follow from the defining sequences for\nVm and Vm\u2032 . The exactness of the sequence follows from diagramm chasing. (ii) is\nclear.\n(iii). Since we assume e0 = 0, t0 is a global function on V \u2032 and it is a global section in\nthe relative very ample line bundle HP(V \u2032 ) on P(V \u2032 ), and P(V ) is the corresponding\ndivisor. Therefore the normal bundle of this embedding is i\u2217 HP(V \u2032 ) \u223c\n= HP(V ) .\n\u2032\n(iv). First we may identify the closed subset {Q \u2208 V : t0 (Q) = 1} with P(V \u2032 ) \u2212\nP(V ). The described action on W respects the forcing equation, for f1 (\u03bbx)\u03bbe1 t1 +\n. . . + fn (\u03bbx)\u03bben tn + f0 (\u03bbx) = \u03bbd1 \u03bbe1 f1 (x)t1 + . . . + \u03bbdn \u03bben fn (x)tn + \u03bbd0 f0 (x) =\n\u03bbm (f1 (x)t1 + . . . + fn (x)tn + f0 (x)) = 0. This action on W |U = W \u2212 p\u22121 (P ) is the\nsame action as the action on the vector bundle V (f1 t1 + . . . + f0 t0 )|U restricted to\nt0 = 1 described in Proposition 4(ii). Its quotient is {Q \u2208 V \u2032 : t0 (Q) = 1}.\n\u0003\nNow we specialize to the two-dimensional situation.\nCorollary 6. Let X be a normal affine two-dimensional cone over a smooth projective curve Y and let P be the vertex point. Let f1 , f2 be homogeneous functions such\nthat P = {f1 = f2 = 0}. Let f0 be another homogeneous function, di = deg(fi ),\nand let ei numbers such that m = di + ei is constant for i = 0, 1, 2. Let Vm (Vm\u2032 )\nbe the corresponding vector bundles on Y . Then the following hold.\n(i) P(V \u2032 ) is a ruled surface and P(V ) \u2282 P(V \u2032 ) is a section (independent of m).\n(ii) We have Vm \u223c\n= HYe0 +d0 \u2212d1 \u2212d2 and the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 HYe0 +d0 \u2212d1 \u2212d2 \u2212\u2192 V \u2032 \u2212\u2192 HYe0 \u2212\u2192 0 .\n(iii) Let e0 = 0. The normal bundel of the embedding Y \u223c\n= P(V ) \u2282 P(V \u2032 ) is\nd1 +d2 \u2212d0\nHY\n.\n(iv) The self intersection number of Y \u223c\n= P(V ) \u0592\u2192 P(V \u2032 ) is (d1 +d2 \u2212d0 ) deg HY .\nProof. (i) is clear due to Proposition 5.\n(ii) From the defining sequence in Proposition 4 it follows that we have Vm \u223c\n=\nHYe1 \u2297 HYe2 \u2297 HY\u2212m = HYe1 +e2 \u2212m = HYe0 +d0 \u2212d1 \u2212d2 .\n(iii). The normal bundel on P(V ) is HP(V ) due to Proposition 5. But for a line\nbundle this is just the negative tautological bundel \u2212V , therefore N = \u2212V =\nH d1 +d2 \u2212d0 .\n(iv). The self intersection number is P(V )2 = degY N = degY H d1 +d2 \u2212d0 = (d1 +\nd2 \u2212 d0 ) deg HY .\n\u0003\n3. A class of examples.\nTheorem 7. Let X be a normal affine two-dimensional cone with vertex point P\nover a smooth projective curve Y , let f1 , f2 and f0 be homogeneous holomorphic\nfunctions on X with degrees d1 , d2 , d0 such that\n(1) V (f1 , f2 ) = P,\n\n(2) f0 6\u2208 (f1 , f2 )OX,P and\n\n(3) d1 + d2 \u2212 d0 < 0 .\n\nLet W = V (f1 t1 + f2 t2 + f0 ) \u2282 X \u00d7 C2 and H = p\u22121 (P ) \u2282 W . Then W \u2212 H \u2282 W\nis not Stein, but for every analytic surface S \u2282 W the intersection (W \u2212 H) \u2229 S is\nStein.\nProof. We have to show that W \u2212 H is not Stein. Since W \u2212 H = W |U , U = X \u2212 P ,\nthe quotient of this open subset under the action of C\u2217 is P(V \u2032 ) \u2212 P(V ). Due to [6]\nit is enough to show that this complement of the section in the ruled surface P(V \u2032 )\n\n\f5\n\nis not Stein. The self intersection of P(V ) is (d0 + d1 \u2212 d0 ) deg HY < 0, hence P(V )\nis due to [3] contractible and the complement cannot be Stein.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8. Let h be an irreducible homogeneous polynomial of degree r in the\nthree variables x, y, z and suppose that x, y are homogeneous parameters (i. e. that\nh = cz r + other terms, c 6= 0) and let X = V (h) \u2282 C3 . Suppose that X is normal\n(hence Y is smooth). Let d1 , d2 \u2265 1 and d0 be degrees such that d1 + d2 < d0 < r.\nThen f1 = xd1 , f2 = y d2 and f0 = z d0 fulfill the conditions of the theorem.\nProof. We have to show that z d0 6\u2208 (xd1 , y d2 )OP . For this we look at the completion\nof the local ring, \u00d4P /(xd1 , y d2 ) = C[[x, y, z]]/(h, xd1 , y d2 ). Since d0 < r = deg(h) we\nsee that z d0 6= 0 in this residue class ring. On the other hand, the self intersection\nnumber is (d1 + d2 \u2212 d0 ) deg HY < 0.\n\u0003\nExample 9. Let X = V (xr + y r + z r ) \u2282 C3 , r \u2265 4 be a Fermat type hypersurface,\nlet\nW = V (xr + y r + z r , xt1 + yt2 + z s ) \u2282 C5 , 3 \u2264 s < r and H = V (x, y) .\nThen the conditions in the corollary are fulfilled.\nThe easiest example of this type is the Fermat quartic x4 + y 4 + z 4 together with\nf1 = x, f2 = y and f0 = z 3 . Therefore\nW = V (x4 + y 4 + z 4 , xt1 + yt2 + z 3 ) and H = V (x, y)\ngives an counter-example to the hypersection problem.\nRemarks 10. The hypersurface H in our example is the singular locus of W . Since\nthe normalization does not change the complement of H and since its preimage is\nstill a hypersurface due to Corollary 2, we also may get normal examples.\nThe condition f0 6\u2208 (f1 , f2 )OP in Corollary 8 ensures that the divisor P(V ) \u2282\nP(V \u2032 ) intersects every curve C \u2282 P(V \u2032 ) positively. For a disjoined curve would yield\na closed punctured surface (its cone) inside W \u2212 H. If additionally d1 + d2 \u2212 d0 > 0,\nthen P(V ) is an ample divisor and its complement is affine, hence Stein. What\nhappens if d1 + d2 \u2212 d0 = 0? Then the complement is not affine, but it may be\nStein. For h = x3 + y 3 + z 3 = 0, f1 = x, f2 = y and f0 = z 2 we get an instance of\nthe classical construction of Serre of a Stein, but non-affine variety, see [8].\nReferences\n[1] Coltoiu, M., Diederich, K.: Open sets with Stein hypersurface sections in Stein spaces.\nAnn.
