This allows us to reconcile\nthe value and doping dependence of the superfluid density slope at low temperature obtained from\npenetration depth measurements, with photoemission data on nodal quasiparticles.\nPACS numbers: PACS numbers: 74.20.De,71.10.Ay,74.72.-h\n\nThe high temperature superconductors appear to support well-defined quasiparticle (QP) excitations at low\ntemperatures (T \u226a Tc ) as suggested by penetration\ndepth1 , transport2,3,4 , and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy5 (ARPES) experiments. Low temperature superconducting (SC) state properties of the\ncuprates thus appear to be consistent with d-wave BCS\ntheory with nodal QP excitations. However, the importance of correlations at low T is evident with underdoping: experiments6 show that the superfluid stiffness\nDs (T = 0) \u223c x, and the QP weight at (\u03c0, 0) diminishes on\napproaching the Mott insulator7 . In this paper we address the question of interaction corrections to the temperature dependence of Ds (T ).\nThe in-plane superfluid stiffness Ds (T )\n=\n(c2 d/4\u03c0e2 \u03bb2 ), with d the mean interlayer spacing\nalong the c-axis, can be directly obtained from measurements of the in-plane penetration depth, \u03bb(T ).\nDs (T ) is found to decrease linearly with temperature1\nDs (T ) = Ds (0) \u2212 AT for T \u226a Tc , with a slope A which\nis nearly doping independent8,9 (or weakly decreasing\nbut nonsingular) as x \u2192 0.\nClearly the linear drop in Ds (T ) is due to thermally\ngenerated excitations which contribute to the normal\nfluid density. BCS theory with noninteracting QP excitations around the four d-wave nodes leads to the result\nDs (T ) = Ds (0) \u2212\n\n2ln2 vF\nT.\n\u03c0 v2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity and v2 is related to the\nslope of the SC gap via v2 = (1/kF )\u2202\u2206(\u03b8)/\u2202\u03b8|\u03b8=\u03c0/4 , at\nthe nodal Fermi wavevector kF . Mesot et al.10 obtained\nthe nodal QP dispersion parameters vF and v2 as a function of doping from ARPES data on Bi2212, and compared the Ds slope obtained from Eq.(1) with \u03bb measurements. They found that the slope estimated in this manner is too large by more than a factor of two at optimal\ndoping - the ARPES results10 of vF = 2.5 \u00d7 107 cm/sec\nand v2 = 1.25 \u00d7 106 cm/sec lead to an estimated slope\ndDs /dT = 0.77meV/K, while the slope obtained from\npenetration depth experiments11,12,13 is approximately\n0.33meV/K. Furthermore, this discrepancy increases\n\nwith underdoping since v2 measured in ARPES decreases\nmarginally leading to a slight increase in the estimated\nslope dDs /dT on underdoping, while the slope obtained\nfrom penetration depth experiments in Bi2212 decreases\nsomewhat with underdoping13 . This is in contrast to the\nrather striking agreement between estimates from thermal transport measurements4 and ARPES10 for the ratio\nvF /v2 \u2248 20 at optimal doping in Bi2212.\nFollowing Refs.14,15 , we attribute this discrepancy to\nresidual QP interactions or Fermi liquid corrections. We\nuse here a phenomenological superfluid Fermi liquid theory (SFLT) to explore the effects of lattice anisotropy\non QP interactions in more detail than in earlier studies;\n(see, however ref.16 ). Some of the results obtained below were summarized without derivation in a conference\nreport17 .\nWe note that thermal phase fluctuations18 are ignored\nhere, since we have shown elsewhere19 that a proper\ntreatment of the long-range Coulomb interaction results\nin their contribution to Ds (T ) being subdominant to that\nof the nodal QPs.\nSuperfluid Fermi liquid theory: Fermi liquid (FL)\ntheory for a normal Fermi system is based on the existence of well-defined (coherent) QP excitations which are\nadiabatic continuations of the single particle excitations\nof a free Fermi gas. While transport and ARPES experiments suggest that the normal state of optimal and\nunderdoped high-Tc SC's is not a FL, nevertheless, sharp\nQP peaks do appear all over the Fermi surface (FS) deep\nin the SC state (for T \u226aTc ). Naturally, one is then led\nto consider a description of the SC state and its low lying QP excitations as an adiabatic continuation of a BCS\nstate with Bogoliubov QP excitations.\nThe approach advocated in refs.14,15 , and adopted below, assumes that such a SC state may be viewed as a correlated FL in which a pairing interaction has been turned\non20 . In this case, one can use the superfluid Fermi liquid theory (SFLT) developed many years ago21,22,23 , and\ngeneralize it to the anisotropic case.\nFor a normal Fermi system, the change in free energy\ndue to a change in the QP momentum distribution \u03b4nk\n\n\f2\ntakes the standard form\nX\n1X\nf (k, k\u2032 )\u03b4nk \u03b4nk\u2032\n\u03b4F [\u03b4nk ] =\n\u03bek0 \u03b4nk +\n2 \u2032\nk\n\n(2)\n\nk,k\n\nwhere \u03bek0 is the dispersion for the QP of momentum k in\nthe absence of other QP's, fP\n(k, k\u2032 ) is the Landau interaction function, and \u03b4nk = \u03c3 \u03b4nk,\u03c3 . We have ignored\nthe spin-dependent part of f (k, k\u2032 ) in order to simplify\nthe notation; the generalization with spin is straightforward, but not relevant for the present discussion. We\nwill refer to the QP's obtained by setting f (k, k\u2032 ) = 0\nin the above equation, as non-interacting QP's. The dispersion for these QP's is \u03bek0 which does include the mass\nrenormalization.\nWe now use the above functional to calculate the superfluid stiffness at low temperatures, in two steps: (1)\nwe calculate the diamagnetic response to a vector potential and (2) we calculate the renormalization of the\ncurrent carried by the interacting QP's, relative to free\nQP's, and use this to compute the paramagnetic current\ncorrelator of the QP's. We next use the above quantities as inputs to a Kubo formula in the QP basis, which\nallows us to determine the superfluid stiffness Ds (T ).\nDiamagnetic term: Let n0k be the unperturbed equilibrium QP distribution. In the presence of the vector\npotential n0k \u2192 n0k+eA/c leading to a shift of the momentum distribution \u03b4nk = n0k+eA/c \u2212 n0k .

The term linear in A vanishes, since the integrand is odd in k, and we get\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\nX\n1\n\u03b4F = A\u03bc A\u03bd \uf8f0\n\u03bek0 \u2207\u03bc,\u03bd n0k +\nf (k, k\u2032 )\u2207\u03bc n0k \u2207\u2032\u03bd n0k \uf8fb\n2\n\u2032\nk\n\n\u2261\n\nk,k\n\n1 \u03bc \u03bd\nA A K\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere K\u03bc\u03bd is the diamagnetic response.\nGiven the jump discontinuity in the \"normal\" state,\n0\nQP distribution at the FS, we use \u2207\u03bc n0k = \u22122vk\u03bc\n\u03b4(\u03bek0 ),\nwhere the factor of 2 arises from summing over both\nspins.

The total QP current\nJ is then k vk nk , which reduces to\nX\nX\nJ=\nvk0 \u03b4nk \u2212\n(6)\nf (k, k\u2032 )\u03b4nk\u2032 \u2207n0k ,\nk\n\nk,k\u2032\n\nP\nwhere we have used k vk0 n0k = 0 in the first term, since\nthe equilibrium QP population does not carry any current. In the second term, we have transferred the kderivative from f (k, k\u2032 ) to nk , with nk \u2248 n0k at this order. This relates the current carried by the interacting\nQP, to that carried by a non-interacting QP which only\nhas a mass renormalization.\nTo make further progress in the specific case of a dwave SC, we note that the dominant excitations in the\nlow temperature state are those near the gap nodes. We\ntherefore restrict our attention to the renormalization of\nthe current carried by the QP's at the 4 nodal points\nlocated at kM\n, with M = 1 . . . 4. Setting \u2207\u03bc n0k \u2243\nF\n0\n0\n\u22122vk\u03bc \u03b4(\u03bek ) as before, we find that the contribution to\nthe current at the M -th node\n\"\n#\nX\n2\nJ\u03bc (M ) = J\u03bc0 (M ) 1+\nf (kM\n, k\u2032 )vk0 \u2032 \u03bc \u03b4(\u03bek0 \u2032 )\nF\nvF \u03bc (M ) \u2032\nk\n\n\u2261 J\u03bc0 (M )\u03b2F\n\n(7)\n\nwhere J\u03bc0 (M ) \u2261 vF \u03bc (M )\u03b4nk (M ) is the non-interacting\nQP current. In arriving at the above result, we have\ninterchanged the k, k\u2032 labels in the second term, used the\nsymmetry, f (k, k\u2032 ) = f (k\u2032 , k), and there is no implicit\nsum over \u03bc in Eq. (7).\nThe superfluid stiffness: From the Kubo formula,\nwe find Ds\u03bc\u03bd = K\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u039b\u03bc\u03bd (q \u2192 0, i\u03c9n = 0) where\n\u039b\u03bc\u03bd (q, i\u03c9n ) \u2261 hj\u03bc (q, i\u03c9n )j\u03bd (\u2212q, \u2212i\u03c9n )i is the current\ncorrelator and we take the transverse limit of q \u2192 0.\nIn the QP basis, there are no excitations at T = 0\nand Ds\u03bc\u03bd (T = 0) = K\u03bc\u03bd . At low temperatures, there\nare nodal QP excitations and the current operator in\n\u039b(q, i\u03c9n ) has matrix elements between the ground state\nand these excited states. The current carried by the QP's\nis however renormalized by the factor \u03b2F which leads to\n\u039b = \u03b2F2 \u039b0 , with \u039b0 being the correlator for the noninteracting QP's. The correlator \u039b0 is easily evaluated\nwithin BCS theory using the dispersion \u03bek0 , and is linear\nin T at low temperature in a d-wave SC. Further, there\nare polarization effects by which the flowing QP's lead\nto an internal (fictitious) vector potential arising from\nthe f (k, k\u2032 ), in addition to the applied vector potential23 .\nThis effect is important close to Tc when there are a large\nnumber of QP's, but it is unimportant at low temperature when there are very few thermally excited QP's22,23 .\nThe superfluid stiffness in a d-wave SC at low T is thus\ngiven by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 ln 2 vF\n0\n2\nDs (T ) = \u03b1F K \u2212 \u03b2F\nT\n(8)\n\u03c0 v2\n\n\f3\n0\nwhere K 0 = (1/d) TrK\u03bc\u03bd\nin d-dimensions, assuming cubic symmetry. We now proceed to discuss the FL corrections \u03b1F , \u03b2F in more detail.\nIsotropic limit: For an isotropic system vF and kF\nare independent of the location on the FS and m\u2217 \u2261\nkF /vF is the effective mass. The Landau interaction\nf (k, k\u2032 ) \u2261 f (k * k\u2032 ) and depends only on the angle\nbetween the two momenta on the FS. Retaining only\nthe single Landau parameter relevant for this discussion,\nf (k * k\u2032 ) = (dn/d\u01eb)\u22121 F1 cos \u03b8, where cos \u03b8 = k\u0302 * k\u0302\u2032 and\n(dn/d\u01eb) = m\u2217 /\u03c0 is the total \"normal\" state QP density\nof states for both spins. It is then easy to see that in 2D\nn\n(9)\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 (1 + F1 /2)\nm\nwhere the 2D electron density n = kF2 /2\u03c0. From Eq. (5),\nwe thus find \u03b1F = (1 + F1 /2). (For the special case of\na Galilean-invariant system, using the Landau relation\n(1+F1 /2) = m\u2217 /m in 2D, we find K\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd (n/m)). It is\nalso easy to find that the renormalization of the current in\nthe isotropic case is given by J\u03bc = J\u03bc0 (1 + F1 /2), and the\ncurrent correlator is then \u039b = \u03b2F2 \u039b0 with \u03b2F = (1+F1 /2).\nThese results for \u03b1F , \u03b2F are in agreement with the earlier\nwork of Larkin and Migdal21 and Leggett22 .\nWe now discuss the shortcomings of isotropic SFLT as\napplied to the high Tc SC's following Ref.14 . Low temperature penetration depth experiments6 suggest that\nDs (x, T = 0) \u223c x. At the same time, ARPES experiments, as well as theoretical studies of SC in doped Mott\ninsulators25 , suggest that m\u2217 does not diverge on underdoping. Within the isotropic SFLT framework, these\ntwo together imply (1 + F1 /2) \u223c x which in turn means\nthe slope of Ds (x, T ) is proportional to (1 + F1 /2)2 \u223c x2 .\nThis scaling of the slope26 , however, is in strong disagreement with penetration depth measurements. Following\nthe suggestion14 that this problem may be resolved by\nincluding anisotropy of the Landau interaction function\nover the FS, we next try to understand FL corrections in\nthe anisotropic case.\nAnisotropic case: In order to set up a phenomenological SFLT on a 2D square lattice, we first rewrite\nall our functions in terms of an angle variable \u03b8 which\nsweeps over the large hole-barrel FS centered around\n(\u03c0, \u03c0). Then, the Fermi momentum kF \u2261 kF (\u03b8), the\nFermi velocity vF \u2261 vF (\u03b8) and the Landau interaction\nfunction f (k, k\u2032 ) \u2261 f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ). We expand these in an orthogonal basis\n\nvF X (\u03b8) =\nvF Y (\u03b8) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl=0\n\u221e\nX\n\nVX(l) cos [(2l + 1)\u03b8]\n\n(10)\n\nVY(l) sin [(2l + 1)\u03b8]\n\n(11)\n\nl=0\n\nkF (\u03b8) = kF 0 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nkF(l) cos(4l\u03b8),\n\n(12)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere we have used the symmetries of the square lattice to restrict the form of the expansion, and also\n\nused the vector (scalar) character of the vF (kF ). We\nmay also generally expand the interaction, f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) =\nP\nil\u03b8 im\u03b8 \u2032\ne\n. We restrict the form of f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) usl,m Fl,m e\ning the following symmetries: (i) f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) = f (\u03b8\u2032 , \u03b8), (ii)\nf (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) = f (\u2212\u03b8, \u2212\u03b8\u2032 ) and (iii) f (\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8, \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) =\nf (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ). While (i) is generally valid, (ii) and (iii) are\nvalid for a square lattice. This finally leads to\nX\nf (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 )=\nFl,m [cos(l\u03b8 + m\u03b8\u2032 ) + cos(l\u03b8\u2032 + m\u03b8)] (13)\nl\u2265m\n\nwhere l, m : \u2212\u221e \u2192 \u221e with (l + m) = 4p and p =\n0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .. We have set l \u2265 m to avoid overcounting.\nWe note that: (a) the interaction function depends on \u03b8\nand \u03b8\u2032 separately in general and not only on (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) as\nin the isotropic case and (b) there are many more Landau parameters on the lattice, labeled by two integers\n(l, m). As we shall see, this considerably complicates our\nproblem since many Landau parameters may contribute\nto a given response function, which prevents their unique\ndetermination27 . This is unlike the isotropic case (say in\nHe3 ) where usually a single Landau parameter renormalizes a particular correlation function.\nWe now write the results for \u03b1F , \u03b2F in these new coordinates. The diamagnetic term is given by\nKxx = 2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\n+4\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nd\u03b8 kF (\u03b8) 2\nv (\u03b8)\n(2\u03c0)2 |vF (\u03b8)| F X\n\n(14)\n\nd\u03b8d\u03b8\u2032 kF (\u03b8) kF (\u03b8\u2032 )\nv (\u03b8)vF X (\u03b8\u2032 )f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 )\n(2\u03c0)4 |vF (\u03b8)| |vF (\u03b8\u2032 )| F X\n\nand the current renormalization for node-M is\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03b8\u2032 kF (\u03b8\u2032 ) vF X (\u03b8\u2032 )\nJx (M )\n=1+2\nf (\u03b8M , \u03b8\u2032 ) (15)\nJx0 (M )\n(2\u03c0)2 |vF (\u03b8\u2032 )| vF X (\u03b8M )\n0\nwhere \u03b8M is the angular position of node-M . We can\nexpress this in a more compact form by defining hOi\u03b8 \u2261\nR 2\u03c0\n0 d\u03b8kF (\u03b8)O(\u03b8)/(2\u03c0|vF (\u03b8)|). This yields\n\u03b1F = 1 +\n\nhhvF X (\u03b8)vF X (\u03b8\u2032 )f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 )ii\u03b8\u03b8\u2032\n\u03c0hvF2 X i\u03b8\n\n(16)\n\n\u03b2F = 1 +\n\nhvF X (\u03b8\u2032 )f (\u03b8M , \u03b8\u2032 )i\u03b8\u2032\n\u03c0vF X (\u03b8M )\n\n(17)\n\nFor f (\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 ) = (\u03c0/m\u2217 )F1 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) and kF , vF independent of \u03b8, we easily recover the isotropic limit.\nSimple models for the dispersion and f (k, k\u2032 ): We\nnow consider special cases of the general result which\nserve to illustrate the deviation from the isotropic limit.\nCase I: Consider an isotropic dispersion, with vF and\nkF independent of \u03b8, but retain all allowed Landau parameters on the lattice. In this case, with m\u2217 \u2261 kF /vF ,\nwe find\n\u03b1F = 1 +\n\nm\u2217\n(F1,1 + F1,\u22121 )\n\u03c0\n\n\f4\n\u03b1F 6= \u03b2F and they could then also behave very differently\nwith doping if several Landau parameters are nonzero.\n\nFIG. 1: Doping dependence of the SFLT renormalization (\u03b2F2 )\nof the slope of Ds (T ) for a model with anisotropic QP dispersion and a single Landau parameter chosen such that (a)\n\u03b1F (x) = 1.5x and (b) \u03b1F (x) = 2.5x (see Case II in text for\ndetails). In the isotropic limit, \u03b2F2 (x) = \u03b12F (x), but there is\nmarked deviation from this in the anisotropic case - most\nstrikingly \u03b2F2 (x) 6=!0 as x \u2192 0, as in the experiments. For\nthis simple model and choice of dispersion, a larger renormalization of Ds (0) (smaller \u03b1(x) as in panel (a)) appears to\ncorrelate with a weaker doping dependence of \u03b2F2 (x).\n\nCase II: We next consider the case where we keep a single Landau parameter F1,\u22121 6= 0, and set all other Fl,m =\n0. We however retain the full anisotropy of the dispersion, as measured in ARPES. We take the tight-binding\nfit to the (normal state) ARPES dispersion28 , and numerically compute the above integrals to determine \u03b1F , \u03b2F .\nIn order to study the doping dependence of \u03b1F , \u03b2F , we\nassume a doping dependence F1,\u22121 (x) = B + Cx, such\nthat \u03b1F (x) \u223c x in agreement with the Uemura plot6 ,\nwith reasonable values \u03b1F (x = 0.2) \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.5. This\nfixes B, C and we use this to determine the doping dependence of \u03b2F (x). The result of this calculation is plotted\nin Fig. 1(a,b) where we see a marked deviation from the\nisotropic result (\u03b2F2 = \u03b12F ) - in the anisotropic case, \u03b2F2\nis nonsingular as x \u2192 0, in qualitative agreement with\npenetration depth results.\n\n\uf8eb\nX\nm\u2217 \uf8ed X\n(\u22121)p F1,4p\u22121 +\n(\u22121)p F4p+1,\u22121\n= 1+\n2\u03c0\np\u22640\np\u22650\n!\nX\nX\np\np\n(18)\n+\n(\u22121) F4p\u22121,1 +\n(\u22121) F\u22121,4p+1\n\nConclusions: We have used a phenomenological SFLT\nfor a d-wave SC to determine the renormalization of\nDs (T = 0) and dDs /dT due to FL factors. Within simple models for the dispersion and the Landau interaction function, we find that anisotropy can cause strong\ndeviations from the isotropic result. This allows us to\nunderstand the discrepancy between penetration depth\nand photoemission experiments for the temperature and\ndoping dependence of the superfluid density in terms of\nSFLT corrections. While we discussed the case of a dwave order parameter as appropriate for the high Tc SC's,\nour results are easily generalized to any unconventional\nSC with point nodes and well-defined QP's.\n\nThus, many Landau parameters contribute to the renormalization in this anisotropic case unlike in the isotropic\nlimit. Furthermore, different Landau parameters contribute to \u03b1F and \u03b2F . It is then easily possible that\n\nAcknowledgments: A.P. was supported through NSF\ngrants DMR-9985255 and PHY99-07949, and the Sloan\nand Packard Foundations.
