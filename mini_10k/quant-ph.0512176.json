It was shown that these constraints, known as Bell inequalities, are incompatible\nwith the quantitative predictions by quantum mechanics in case of entangled states. For example, the original Bell inequality is violated by a singlet state of two\nspin-1/2 particles [1]. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\n(CHSH) inequality is another common form of Bell inequality, allowing more flexibility in local measurement\nconfigurations [2]. These constraints are of great importance for understanding the conceptual features of\nquantum mechanics and draw the boundary between\nlocal-realistic and quantum correlations. One may doubt\nif there is any well-defined constraint for many highdimensional subsystems which would eventually simulate a classical system as increasing its dimensionality\nto infinity [3]. Therefore, constraints for more complex\nsystems such as multi-partite or high-dimensional systems have been proposed and investigated intensively\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nFor bipartite high-dimensional systems, Collins et al.\nsuggested a local-realistic constraint, called CGLMP inequality [5]. It is violated by quantum mechanics and its\ncharacteristics of violation are consistent with the numerical results provided by Kaszlikowski et al. [6]. Further,\nMasanes showed that the CGLMP inequality is tight [7],\nwhich implies that the inequality has no interior bias as a\nlocal-realistic constraint. However, Acin et al. found that\nthe CGLMP inequality shows maximal violation by nonmaximally entangled state [8]. Zohren and Gill found\nthe similar results when they applied CGLMP inequality\nto infinite dimensional systems [9]. Recently, Son et al.\n[10] suggested a generic Bell inequality and its variant\nfor arbitrary high-dimensional systems. The variant will\nbe called SLK inequality throughout this paper. They\nshowed that the SLK inequality is maximally violated by\nmaximally entangled state. Very recently, the CGLMP\ninequality was recasted in the structure of the SLK in-\n\nequality by choosing appropriate coefficients [11].\nIn this paper, we propose a generalized structure of\nBell inequalities for bipartite arbitrary d-dimensional systems, which includes various types of Bell inequalities\nproposed previously. A Bell inequality in the given generalized structure can be represented either in the correlation function space or joint probability space. We show\nthat a Bell inequality in one space can be mapped into the\nother space by Fourier transformation. The two types of\nhigh-dimensional Bell inequalities, CGLMP and SLK, are\nrepresented in terms of the generalized structure with appropriate coefficients in both spaces (Sec. II). We investigate the violation of Bell inequalities by quantum mechanics. The expectations of local-realistic theories and\nquantum mechanics are determined by the coefficients of\ncorrelation functions or joint probabilities. The CGLMP\ninequality is maximally violated by non-maximally entangled state while the SLK is by maximally entangled\nstate (Sec. III). We also investigate the tightness of Bell\ninequalities which represents whether they contain an interior bias or not at the boundary between local-realistic\nand quantum correlations. Then we show that the SLK\nis a non-tight Bell inequality while the CGLMP is tight\n(Sec. IV).\n\nII. GENERALIZED ARBITRARY\nDIMENSIONAL BELL INEQUALITY\n\nWe generalize a Bell inequality for bipartite arbitrary\nd-dimensional systems. Suppose that each observer independently choose one of two observables denoted by A1\nor A2 for Alice, and B1 or B2 for Bob. Here we associate\na hermitian observables H to a unitary operator U by\nthe simple correspondence, U = exp(iH), and call U a\nunitary observable [10, 12, 13, 14]. We note that unitary\nobservable representation induces mathematical simplifications without altering physical results [19]. Each outcome takes the value of an element in the set of order\nd, V = {1, \u03c9, ..., \u03c9 d\u22121}, where \u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/d). The assumption of local-realistic theories implies that the out-\n\n\f2\ncomes of observables are predetermined before measurements and the role of the measurements is just to reveal\nthe values. The values are determined only by local hidden variables \u03bb, i.e., Aa (\u03bb) and Bb (\u03bb) for a, b = 1, 2.\nWe denote a correlation between specific measurements taken by two observers, as Aa (\u03bb)Bb\u2217 (\u03bb). Based\non the local hidden-variable description, the correlation\nfunction is the average over many trials of the experiment\nas\nZ\nCab = d\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)Aa (\u03bb)Bb\u2217 (\u03bb),\n(1)\nwhere \u03c1(\u03bb) is the statistical distribution of the hidden\nvariables \u03bb with the properties of \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2265 0 and\nR\nd\u03bb\u03c1(\u03bb) = 1. The correlation function can be expanded\nin terms of joint probability functions over all possible\noutcome pairs (k, l) with complex-valued weight as\nCab =\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c9 k\u2212l P (Aa = k, Bb = l),\n\n(2)\n\nk,l=0\n\nwhere \u03c9 k\u2212l is called a correlation weight and P (Aa =\nk, Bb = l) is a joint probability of Alice and Bob obtaining outcomes \u03c9 k and \u03c9 l respectively. Here we use\nthe powers k and l of the outcomes \u03c9 k and \u03c9 l for the\narguments of the joint probability as there is one-to-one\ncorrespondence.\nWe assume in general a correlation weight \u03bck,l to satisfy certain conditions [15]. [C.1] The correlation expectation vanishes for a P\nbipartite system withPa locally\nunpolarized subsystem:\nl \u03bck,l =\nk \u03bck,l = 0, \u2200l and\n0, \u2200k [C.2] The correlation weight is unbiased over possible outcomes of each subsystem (translational symmetry within modulo d): \u03bck,l = \u03bck+\u03b3,l+\u03b3 , \u2200\u03b3. [C.3] The\ncorrelation weight is uniformly distributed modulo d:\n|\u03bck+1,l \u2212 \u03bck,l | = |\u03bck,l+1 \u2212 \u03bck,l |, \u2200k, l. The correlation\nweight in Eq. (2) \u03c9 k\u2212l satisfies all the conditions, can be\nwrittenPas \u03c9 \u03b1 where \u03b1 \u2261 k \u2212 l \u2208 {0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1} and it\nobeys \u03b1 \u03c9 \u03b1 = 0.\nLet us now consider higher-order(n) correlations following also the local hidden-variable description. The\nn-th order correlation function averaged over many trials\nof the experiment corresponds to the n-th power of 1-st\norder correlation as\nZ\n(n)\nn\nCab =\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb) (Aa (\u03bb)Bb\u2217 (\u03bb))\n=\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c9 n(k\u2212l) P (Aa = k, Bb = l)\n\nk,l=0\n\n=\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n.\n\u03c9 n\u03b1 P (Aa = Bb + \u03b1),\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b1=0\n\nwhere the n-th order correlation weight \u03c9 n\u03b1 also satis.\nfies the above conditions, C.1, C.2 and C.3, and P (Aa =\nBb + \u03b1) is the joint probability of local measurement outcomes differing by a positive residue \u03b1 modulo d. Here we\n\nnote that the higher-order correlations Eq. (3) show the\n(d+n)\n(n)\nperiodicity of Cab\n= Cab and they have the Fourier\nrelation with the joint probabilities as given in Eq. (3).\nWe present a generalized Bell function for arbitrary ddimensional system using higher-order correlation functions as\nB=\n\nX d\u22121\nX\n\n(n)\n\nfab (n)Cab ,\n\n(4)\n\na,b n=0\n\nwhere coefficients fab (n) are functions of the correlation\norder n and the measurement configurations a, b. They\ndetermine the constraint of local-realistic theories with a\ncertain upper bound and its violation by quantum mechanics will be investigated in Sec. III. The zero-th order correlation has no meaning as it simply shift the\nvalue\nof B by a constant and is chosen to vanish, i.e.,\nP\nf\na,b ab (0) = 0. The Bell function in Eq. (4) is rewritten in terms of the joint probabilities given in Eq. (3),\nas\nB=\n\nX\nX d\u22121\n\n.\n\u01ebab (\u03b1)P (Aa = Bb + \u03b1),\n\n(5)\n\na,b \u03b1=0\n\nwhere \u01ebab (\u03b1) are coefficients of the joint probabilities\n.\nP (Aa = Bb + \u03b1).\nWe note that the coefficients \u01ebab (\u03b1) are obtained by\nthe Fourier transformation of fab (n) based on the kernel\nof a given correlation weight as\n\u01ebab (\u03b1) =\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\nfab (n)\u03c9 n\u03b1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nd\u22121\n1X\n\u01ebab (\u03b1)\u03c9 \u2212n\u03b1 .\nd \u03b1=0\n\n(7)\n\nn=0\n\nfab (n) =\n\nIt is remarkable that one can represent a given Bell function either in the correlation function space or joint probability space by using the Fourier transformation of the\ncoefficients between them. This is the generalization of\nthe Fourier transformation in 2-dimensional Bell inequalities provided by Werner et al. [16].\nDifferent Bell inequalities can be represented by altering coefficients of the generalized structure, including previously proposed Bell inequalities in bipartite systems. In the case of d = 2, CHSH-type inequalities can\nbe obtained with coefficients as f (1) = (1, 1, \u22121, 1) and\n\u01ebab (\u03b1) = fab (1)(\u22121)\u03b1 where \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 1}. For arbitrary ddimensional systems, the two types of Bell inequalities,\nCGLMP and SLK, are represented in terms of the generalized structure with appropriate coefficients obtained\nas follows.\nCGLMP inequality - As it was originally proposed in\nterms of joint probabilities [5], the Bell function of the\nCGLMP inequality is in the form of (5) and its coeffi-\n\n\f3\ncients are given as\n\nIII.\n\n \u0307 1)\n2\u03b1\n2(\u03b1 \u2212\n, \u01eb12 (\u03b1) = \u22121 +\n,\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1\n, \u01eb22 (\u03b1) = 1 \u2212\n,\n(8)\n\u01eb21 (\u03b1) = \u22121 +\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\n\u01eb11 (\u03b1) = 1 \u2212\n\nwhere the dot implies the positive residue modulo d.

By varying \u03b4 and \u03b71,2 , one can\nhave many variants of SLK inequalities. For all the variants the coefficients in the joint probability picture are\nobtained as\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nS(\u03b4 + \u03b1),\nS(\u03b4 + \u03b71 + \u03b1),\nS(\u03b4 + \u03b72 + \u03b1),\nS(\u03b4 + \u03b71 + \u03b72 + \u03b1),\n\nIn order to see the violation of Bell inequalities by\nquantum mechanics we need to know the upper bound by\nlocal hidden variable theories. We note that a probabilistic expectation of a Bell function is given by the convex\ncombination of all possible deterministic values of the\nBell function and the local-realistic upper bound is decided by the maximal deterministic value. Let \u03b1ab = \u03b1\n.\nsuch that P (Aa = Bb + \u03b1) = 1. The assumption of localrealistic theories implies that the values \u03b1ab are predetermined. For a Bell function in the form of Eq. (4) or (5),\n.\nthey obey the constraint, \u03b111 + \u03b122 = \u03b112 + \u03b121 , because\nof the identity, A1 \u2212 B1 + A2 \u2212 B2 = A1 \u2212 B2 + A2 \u2212 B1 .\nThe local-realistic upper bound of the Bell function is\ntherefore given by\nmax\nBLR\n= max[\n\u03b1ab\n\nX\n\n.\n\u01ebab (\u03b1ab )|\u03b111 + \u03b122 = \u03b112 + \u03b121 ].

In the frame work of the generalized\nstructure we will now study how the coefficients determine the characteristics of Bell inequalities such as the\ndegree of violation and tightness.\n\nwhere B\u0302 is the Bell operator defined by replacing the\ncorrelation function in Eq. (4) with correlation operaP\n(n)\nn(k\u2212l)\nP\u0302a \u2297 P\u0302b where P\u0302a ,P\u0302b are protor, \u0108ab =\nk,l \u03c9\njectors onto the measurement basis denoted by a, b. If\nan expectation value of any quantum state exceeds the\nmax\nlocal realistic bound BLR\n, i.e., the Bell inequality is violated by quantum mechanics, the composite system is\nentangled and shows nonlocal quantum correlations. The\nmaximal quantum expectation is called quantum maximax\nmum BQM\nand corresponds to the maximal eigenvalue\nof the Bell operator. In the case of d = 2, with the coefficients f (1) = (1, 1,\u221a\u22121, 1) we can obtain the quantum\nmax\nmaximum, BQM\n= 2 2, which is in agreement with the\nCirel'son bound [20].\nIn the presence of white noise, a maximally entangled\nstate |\u03c8m i becomes \u03c1\u0302 = p|\u03c8m ih\u03c8m | + (1 \u2212 p)11/d2 where\np is the probability that the state is unaffected by noise.\nThen, the minimal probability for the violation is pmin =\nmax\nBLR\n/BQM(|\u03c8m i). We now investigate the violation of\ntwo types of Bell inequalities, CGLMP and SLK, and\ncompare them as follows.\nCGLMP inequality - The local-realistic upper bound,\nmax\nBLR\n= 2, can be obtained as Eq. (13). The quantum expectation can also be obtained as Eq. (14) and\nit is consistent with the result in Ref. [5]. Acin et\nal. found, however, that the CGLMP inequality shows\nmaximal violation for non-maximally entangled states\n[8]. For 3-dimensional system, the quantum maximum\nmax\nis BQM\n\u2243 2.9149 for the non-maximally entangled state,\n\n\f4\n3\n\n2.2\n\nHaL\n\n2.8\n\n1.8\nBQM\n\n2.6\nBQM\n\nHbL\n\n2\n\n2.4\n\n1.6\n\n2.2\n\n1.4\n\n2\n\n1.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\u0393\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\u0393\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: The expectation value of (a) the CGLMP and (b) the\noptimal SLK\n\u221a for d = 3 as varying the value \u03b3 for the quantum\nstate, (1/ n)(|00i + \u03b3|11i + |22i) where n = 2 + \u03b3 2 . The SLK\ntakes the maximum 2 when the state is maximally entangled\n(\u03b3 = 1), whereas the CGLMP takes the maximum 2.9149 for\na partially entangled state (\u03b3 \u2243 0.7923). The dashed lines\nindicate the local-realistic upper bounds.\n\n\u221a\n(1/ n)(|00i + \u03b3|11i + |22i) where \u03b3 \u2243 0.7923 and n =\n2 + \u03b3 2 . It is higher than the expectation by maximally\nentangled state, B(|\u03c8m i) \u2243 2.8729. The expectation of\nthe CGLMP is shown in Fig. 1 against the entanglement\ndegree \u03b3, once the local measurements are chosen such\nthat they maximize the Bell function for the maximally\nentangled state. Further, we also note that the minimal\nviolation probability(pmin) of the CGLMP decreases as\nthe dimension d increases.\nSLK inequality - Many variants of the SLK Bell inequality are obtained by varying \u03b4 and \u03b71,2 . All the\nvariants of the SLK have the same quantum maximum\nmax\nd \u2212 1 for a maximally entangled state |\u03c8m i, BQM\n=\nBQM (|\u03c8m i), as we prove in Appendix . On the other\nhand, the local-realistic upper bounds depend on the\nmax\nvariants. The local-realistic upper bound BLR\nis a function of the variant factor \u03b4. It shows a periodicity,\nmax\nmax\nBLR\n(\u03b4) = BLR\n(\u03b4 + 1/2), and without loss of generality it suffices to consider 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1/2. If \u03b4 = 0, the\nlocal-realistic upper bound is the same as the quantum\nmaximum d\u22121, and thus the corresponding Bell inequality is not violated by quantum mechanics. When \u03b4 = 1/4,\nwe have the lowest local-realistic upper bound as\nmax\nmin[BLR\n(\u03b4)] =\n\u03b4\n\n1\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0\n(3 cot\n\u2212 cot\n) \u2212 1,\n4\n4d\n4d\n\n(15)\n\nand for other cases the bound values are symmetric\nmax\nmax\nat \u03b4 = 1/4, i.e., BLR\n(1/4 + \u01eb) = BLR\n(1/4 \u2212 \u01eb) for\n0 < \u01eb \u2264 1/4. Therefore, we will call the variant of\n\u03b4 = 1/4, which gives the maximal difference between\nquantum maximum and local-realistic upper bound, as\nthe optimal SLK inequality and use it for comparing to\nthe CGLMP. In Fig. 1, we present the quantum expectation of the SLK for 3-dimensional systems against the\ndegree \u03b3, where the local measurements are chosen such\nthat they maximize the Bell function for the maximally\nentangled state. Note that the SLK inequality shows the\nmaximal violation by maximally entangled states and the\nminimal violation probability pmin increases as the di-\n\nmension d increases.\nBy investigating the violation of two inequalities,\nCGLMP and SLK, based on the generalized structure\nof Bell inequalities, we showed that those two types have\nvery different characteristics. The SLK inequality is maximally violated by maximally entangled states as being\nconsistent with our intuition whereas the CGLMP is\nmaximally violated by non-maximally entangled states.\nWe remark that the coefficients of the given generalized\nstructure determine the characteristics of quantum violations.\nIV.\n\nTIGHTNESS OF BELL INEQUALITIES\n\nThe set of possible outcomes for a given measurement\nsetting forms a convex polytope in the joint probability\nspace or alternatively in the correlation function space\n[7, 16, 17, 18]. Each generator of the polytope represents\nthe predetermined measurement outcome called localrealistic configuration. All interior points of the polytope\nare given by the convex combination of generators and\nthey represent the accessible region of local-realistic theories associated with the probabilistic expectations of measurement outcomes. Therefore, every facet of the polytope is a boundary of halfspace characterized by a linear\ninequality, which we call tight Bell inequality. There are\nnon-tight Bell inequalities which contain the polytope in\nits halfspace. As the non-tight Bell inequality has interior bias at the boundary between local-realistic and\nquantum correlations, one might say it to be the worse\ndetector of the nonlocal test [7, 16, 17].\nThe Bell polytope is lying in the joint probability space\nof dimension h, the degrees of freedom for the measurement raw data. For a bipartite system, two observables\nper party and d-dimensional outcomes, the joint probability, P (Aa = k, Bb = l) where k, l = 0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1 and\na, b = 1, 2, can be arranged in a 4d2 -dimensional vector\nspace. However, the joint probabilities have two constraints, i.e., normalization and no-signaling constraints,\nwhich reduce dimension by 4d [7]. The generators in the\nh-dimensional space can be written, following the notations in Ref. [7], as\nG = |A1 , B1 i \u2295 |A1 , B2 i \u2295 |A2 , B1 i \u2295 |A2 , B2 i\n\n(16)\n\nwhere |ni stands for |n mod di and is the d-dimensional\nvector with a 1 in the n-th component and 0s in the rest.\nIn order to examine the tightness of a given generalized Bell inequality, in general one considers the following conditions that every tight Bell inequality fulfills [7].\n[T.1] All the generators must belong to the half space of\na given facet. [T.2] Among the generators on the facet,\nthere must be h which are linearly independent. First, it\nis straightforward that all generators fulfill the inequality as the Bell inequality derived to do. As the localrealistic upper bound is the maximum among expectation values of local-realistic configurations, all generators\nmax\nare located below the local-realistic upper bound, BLR\n.\n\n\f5\nThus the first condition T.1 is fulfilled. Second, we examine whether there are h linearly independent generators\nmax\nwhich give the value of the local-realistic bound, BLR\n.\nBy the predetermined local-realistic values \u03b1ab , the generators (16) become\n|A, A \u2212 \u03b111 i \u2295 |A, A \u2212 \u03b112 i \u2295 |A \u2212 \u03b112 + \u03b122 , A \u2212 \u03b111 i\n\u2295|A \u2212 \u03b111 + \u03b121 , A \u2212 \u03b112 i,\n(17)\nwhere A \u2208 {0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1} and the number of linearly\nindependent generators is determined by the number of\nsets {\u03b1ab } that give the local-realistic upper bound. If the\nnumber of linear independent generators is not smaller\nthan h = 4d(d \u2212 1), the corresponding Bell inequality is\ntight.\nCGLMP inequality - For the CGLMP inequality the\nlocal-realistic upper bound is achieved when \u03b111 + \u03b122 \u2212\n(\u03b112  \u0307\u2212 1) \u2212 \u03b121 + d \u2212 1 = 0. The condition allows the\nsufficient number of linearly independent generators and\nthe CGLMP inequality is tight [7].\nSLK inequality - For the optimal SLK inequality, the upper bound is obtained in the case that\n{\u03b111 , \u03b112 , \u03b121 , \u03b122 } is equal to one of four sets; {0, 0, d \u2212\n1, d\u22121}, {0, 0, 0, 0},{0, 1, d\u22121, 0},{d\u22121, 0, d\u22121, 0}. Thus\nthere are four types of generators as\n|A, Ai \u2295 |A, Ai \u2295 |A \u2212 1, Ai \u2295 |A \u2212 1, Ai\n|A, Ai \u2295 |A, Ai \u2295 |A, Ai \u2295 |A, Ai\n|A, Ai \u2295 |A, A \u2212 1i \u2295 |A \u2212 1, Ai \u2295 |A \u2212 1, A \u2212 1i\n|A, A + 1i \u2295 |A, Ai \u2295 |A, A + 1i \u2295 |A, Ai\n(18)\nwhich are linearly independent with A \u2208 {0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1}.\nThere are only 4d linearly independent generators which\nare smaller than h = 4d(d \u2212 1), the tightness condition\nT.2. Thus the optimal SLK inequality is non-tight. On\nthe other hand, the SLK inequality for \u03b4 = 0 is tight but\nit is not violated by quantum mechanics.\nV.\n\nREMARKS\n\nIn summary, we presented a generalized structure of\nthe Bell inequalities for arbitrary d-dimensional bipartite\nsystems by considering the correlation function specified\nby a well-defined complex-valued correlation weight. The\ncoefficients of a given Bell inequality in the correlation\nfunction space and the joint probability space were shown\nto be in the Fourier relation. Two known types of highdimensional Bell inequalities, CGLMP and SLK, were\nshown to have the generalized structure in common and\nwe found their coefficients in both spaces.\nBased on the generalized structure, we investigated\ncharacteristics of the Bell inequalities such as quantum\nviolation and tightness. We found that the CGLMP and\nSLK inequalities show different characteristics. For instance, the SLK inequality is maximally violated by maximally entangled states, which is consistent with the intuition \"the larger entanglement, the stronger violation\n\nagainst local-realistic theories,\" whereas the CGLMP inequality is maximally violated by the non-maximally entangled state as previously shown by Acin et al. [8].\nOn the other hand, in analyzing the tightness of the inequalities, the CGLMP is tight but the SLK inequality\nis found to be non-tight for \u03b4 6= 0, implying that the\nSLK inequality has interior bias at the boundary between\nlocal-realistic and quantum correlations.\nThe correlation coefficients of Bell inequalities play a\ncrucial role in determining their characteristics of quantum violation and tightness. This implies that by altering\nthe coefficients in the generalized structure one can construct other Bell inequalities. The present work opens\na possibility of finding a new Bell inequality that fulfills\nboth conditions of the maximal violation by maximal entanglement and the tightness.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thanks D.
