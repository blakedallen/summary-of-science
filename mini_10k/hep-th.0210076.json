The foremost\nexample is supersymmetry, [1], in which one postulates Grassmanian extra dimensions and\ngraded extensions of the Lorentz group. Supersymmetry and bosonic extra dimensions\nare essential to the use of string theory with matter fields as a complete description\nof all forces, including quantum gravity. Motivated by certain viable limits of string\ntheory, [2], the possibility of extra conventional spatial dimensions at the \u223c TeV scale,\npossibly accessible to future colliders, has lately become the focus of a lot of activity.\nLatticization, [3], or \"deconstruction,\" [4], of compactified extra dimensional theories\nprovides an effective gauge invariant Lagrangian in 1 + 3 dimensions truncated on N KK\nmodes of scalars, fermions and gauge fields in D dimensions. This has provided a point of\ndeparture for abstracting a new class of models based upon the notion of \"theory space\"\nas emphasized by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi [4].\nTheory space, without some defining principles, is an empty concept. A key idea\nwe emphasize presently is that theory space can be endowed with certain abstract geometrical symmetries that are essentially renormalization group (RG) transformations.\nThese transformations are distinct from scale transformations and truly reflect a geometric structure of the theory. Geometrical symmetries in continuum extra dimensions\ntherefore become replaced by the renormalization group in theory space. We can thus\nturn it around and use the RG to generate new kinds of geometries. In the present paper\nwe study a nontrivial example of the latter possibility.\nIn particular, we will borrow from condensed matter physics certain recursively defined, or fractal, lattices to construct classes of new theory spaces. These lattices are\ndefined by recursively \"decorating\" a lattice of coordination number, s, by replacing each\nsite with a simplex of s sites, preserving the coordination number s. This process is\niterated an arbitrary number, k, times. It results in a lattice, which for us describes a\nfractal theory space matter field theory. In the k \u2192 \u221e limit it describes a continuum\n\ntheory whose properties are determined by certain scaling laws of the (zero temperature) quantum theory, analogous to the scaling laws of critical systems at finite critical\ntemperature.\nThe key observation is that the Feynman path integral for these systems is invariant\nunder a sequence of renormalization group (RG) transformations that map the kth lattice\n\n1\n\n\finto the k \u2212 1 lattice. In the k \u2192 \u221e limit, this RG invariance imples a certain scaling\nlaw for the vacuum action functional, e.g., the Coleman-Weinberg potential. This scaling\nlaw, and consistency with the RG transformations imposed as a symmetry, leads to the\ndetermination of a \"critical exponent,\" \u01eb. This exponent is associated with the number\ndistribution of KK modes with energy:\nN(E) \u221d\n\n\u0012\n\nE\nM\n\n\u0013\u01eb\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere \u01eb is the dimensionality of the extra dimensions; M is a RG invariant mass scale, which\nis interpreted as the effective \"compactification scale.\" The effects of the extra dimension\nshow up only for energy scales E \u2265 M as KK-modes appear. We will obtain irrational\n(indeed, transcendental) values for \u01eb for the lattices considered presently. Since theory\nspace, endowed with such a geometrical symmetry, is effectively a theory of compact extra\ndimensions in the continuum limit, we have thus arrived at a prescription for constructing\na spacetime field theory in a flat spacetime of noninteger dimensionality. Our construction\nis essentially a regularization procedure for the theory, which is ultimately defined as a\ncontinuum limit. Certain delicacies associated with that limit are discussed, including,\ne.g., the \"Casimir\" effects associated with compactification.\nThe kernel lattices we consider are \"complete\" lattices in which every site corresponds\nto a complex scalar field theory of mass \u03bc in 1 + 3 dimensions, and every link is a hopping\nterm, \u039b2 |\u03c6a \u2212\u03c6b |2 , coupling every scalar field at every site to every other site. For example,\n\nin Fig.(1) we show a complete square kernel, equivalent to a tetrahedron, as a zeroth order\nkernel lattice with coordination number s = 3 (this is called the \"truncated 3-simplex\").\nWe then construct the next order lattice by replacing1 each vertex with a simplex. This\n\nintegrates in s\u22121 new fields and s new links per original site. In Fig.(1C) we have replaced\neach site of the kernel with 3-simplices to produce the first order lattice. We then iterate\nthe replacement to produce the second order lattice of Fig.(1D). The procedure can be\niterated k times, and we ultimately imagine k \u2192 \u221e to define a continuum limit. It yields\na system of Nk = (s + 1)sk complex scalar fields coupled through Lk = (s + 1)sk+1/2 links.\nThe renormalization group transformations that define a symmetry of this system\nreduce the kth order lattice Lagrangian back to the (k \u2212 1)th order lattice, preserving the\nFeynman path integral. These are composed of a sequence of \"polygon-\u22c6\" tranformations,\nanalogous to those first discussed by Onsager for the Ising model [8], followed by \"4-chain\n1\n\nThe term \"decorate\" is sometimes used instead of \"replace\" but we will henceforth reserve the term\n\"decorate\" for the RG transformations defined below.\n\n2\n\n\f(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\n(D)\n\nFigure 1: The truncated 3-simplex lattice. (A) Kernel (complete) lattice with coordination\nnumber 3; (B) the decoration which replaces each site under recursion; (C) the first order\ndecorated lattice; (D) the second order decorated lattice. A theory space can be constructed\nby defining each site to correspond to a complex scalar Z|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u03bc2 |\u03c6a |2 , and each link to\n\u2212\u039b2 |\u03c6a \u2212\u03c6b |2 . On the kth order truncated s-simplex we have the number of sites Nk = (s+1)sk ,\nand number of links, Lk = (s + 1)sk+1 /2.\n\u2192 2-chain dedecorations.\" These transformations will be adapted to the 1 + 3 field\n\ntheories that live on sites of the theory space lattice. Such RG manipulations are familiar\nfrom the condensed matter literature, but are tricky in theory space in a fundamental\nway: the deconstructed theory possesses continuum kinetic terms for the field theory in\nthe 1 + 3 Lagrangian. We must include renormalization effects on these kinetic terms,\nup to irrelevant operators that are quartic derivatives, e.g. (\u2202 2 \u03c6)2 /\u039b2 . In particular,\n\n|\u2202(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b )|2 must be interpreted as a quartic derivative (we'll see that discarding this\nterm only affects the high mode number part of the spectrum). These irrelevant operators\nof the derivative expansion are dropped, and the renormalization of the relevant |\u2202\u03c6|2\nterms is determined. This renormalization plays a crucial role in the scaling law for the\nColeman-Weinberg potential. One obtains the effective Lagrangian in the (k\u22121)th lattice,\nwith parameters that are renormalized under the transformations. The consistency of the\nRG symmetry, i.e., of the invariance of the Feynman path integral, is realized only for a\nparticular value of the dimensionality, \u01eb.\n\n3\n\n\fThe solution to the problem of extracting \u01eb essentially adapts the scaling theory of\ncritical exponents [5]. We follow closely the beautiful approach of Dhar [6], who also\ndiscussed many other lattices, and determined the dimensionality for finite temperature\nspin systems. The scaling property of the Coleman-Weinberg potential, and the obtained\nvalues of \u01eb, depend crucially upon the recursive construction of the lattices. Though\nthe physical systems we consider are different than the static spin systems considered\nby Dhar, and we are working in the zero-temperature quantum theory, we nonetheless\nrecover Dhar's result for the noninteger dimensionality of the truncated-s-simplex lattices\nof coordination number s:\n2 ln(s)\n\u01eb=\n.\n(1.2)\nln(2 + s)\nMoreover, we find that there are additional RG invariants. One of these is a mass scale M\nwhich plays the role of the compactification scale of the theory, and arises somewhat mysteriously, much like \u039bQCD by dimensional transmutation. Below the scale M the theory\nis governed only by its zero-modes, and lives in the 1 + 3 dimensions of the original field\ntheories attached to each site of the lattice. Above M the \"KK-modes\" begin to appear\nin the RG invariant distribution of eq.(1.1), which is the main observable of the theory.\nAnother RG invariant leads to the classical \"running coupling constant\" relationship in \u01eb\ndimensions, g 2 \u221d (E/M)\u01eb .\nWhen we go over to theories involving fermions and Yang-Mills fields there are various\nsubtleties. We describe these mostly qualitatively in Section 4. Despite these subtleties, it\nappears that a Standard Model generalization can be constructed in 1+(3+\u01eb) dimensions.\nIn the Conclusions we will address some options to the question of physical interpretation.\n\n2\n\nTransformations for Deconstructed Lattice Fields\n\nWe begin by considering transformations which augment or thin the degrees of freedom of\n1 + 3 theories of many complex scalar fields. These transformations stem from symmetries\nnoticed long ago in the Ising model, [7, 8, 9]. In the language of Ising models a single\nspin1 -link-spin2 combination in the Hamiltonian can always be \"decorated,\" i.e., written\nas a spin1 -link-spin\u2032 -link-spin2 interaction. That is, we can \"integrate in\" the new spin\u2032 ,\nor \"decorate\" the original single link. Thus, an N-spin system can be viewed as a 2N\nspin system upon decorating. The decorations can be arbitrarily complicated, involving\nmany new spins. Conversely, we can \"integrate out\" or \"dedecorate\" the spins internal\nto a chain whose endpoint spins are then renormalized (Fig.(2)).\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: The 3-chain \u2192 2-chain dedecoration transformation integrates out the internal field\nand renormalizes the endpoint fields' kinetic terms and mass terms.\nDecoration is an exact scale transformation for Ising spins, and continuous spins (e.g.,\n\"spherical models\" are spin systems which correspond to our models in the absence of\nkinetic terms). Presently we are dealing with a transverse lattice [10] in which our \"spins\"\nare fields that have 1+3 kinetic terms. For us decoration and dedecoration transformations\nare exact scale transformations only in the limit of very large cut-off \u039b. This occurs\nbecause we perform decoration transformations truncating on quartic derivatives, such\nas |\u2202 2 \u03c6a |2 /\u039b2 . This is, nonetheless, a good approximate transformation in the \u039b \u2192\n\n\u221e limit, or for the low lying states in the spectrum. These transformations become\nsymmetries when the theory is classically scale invariant, i.e., \u03bc2 = 0 and \u039b \u2192 \u221e,\nand when combined with polygon-\u22c6 transformations (below) on the recursively defined\nfractal lattices, they become geometric symmetries for arbitrary \u03bc2 6= 0, i.e., a fixed\nrenormalized \u03bc2 can be defined. The 1 + 3 kinetic terms undergo renormalizations under\nthese transformations, and thus distinguish the present construction from that of a spin\nmodel (e.g., the continuous complex spherical model).\nWe will also require a generalization of Onsager's \"star-triangle\" or more generally,\n\n\"polygon-\u22c6\" transformations that replace a complete polygon of spins, Fig.(3), with a\nradiating star configuration, integrating in a new centroid spin. This transformation\ncan again be done in field theory to leading order in the derivative expansion, provided\nthe plaquette is not oriented (which creates a complication when we attempt to include\nfermions and gauge fields). The polygon-\u22c6 transformations are, thus, only exact for us in\nthe \u039b \u2192 \u221e limit. There will generally be hidden symmetries associated with the new\ncentroid field which may play a role in application to gauge or chiral\u2013fermion theories.\nThe key result is that combining sequences of polygon-\u22c6 and dedecoration transfor5\n\n\fFigure 3: The polygon-\u22c6 transformation for a complete hexagon deletes the intrahexagonal\nlinks, and integrates in a new central field with radial links out the endpoint fields.\n\nmations allows us to map a recursively defined truncated s-simplex lattice at k-th order\ninto the same lattice at k \u2212 1 order with different physical parameters. This leads to the\nrenormalization group as a geometric symmetry in the large k limit. The invariance of the\nColeman-Weinberg potential in the large k limit allows us to determine the dimensionality\nof the theory. This limit corresponds to \u039b \u2192 \u221e, and corrections to the result after trun-\n\ncating the derivative expansion are vanishing. The surviving RG invariant parameters\nallow us to interpret this as a geometric, as opposed to a scale, transformation.\n\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nDedecoration Transformations\nExample: 3-chains \u2192 2-chains\n\nWe warm up with the simplest example of a \"dedecoration transformation\" applied to\nchains of complex scalar fields. This corresponds to a scale transformation on the theory;\nit is a symmetry of the theory only if \u03bc \u2192 0. When \u03bc \u2192 0 we will see that the spectra\nbefore and after the dedecoration transformation coincide in the low energy (low mode\nnumber) limit.\nConsider an N complex scalar field Lagrangian in 1 + 3, which can be viewed as a\ndeconstructed S1 compactified extra dimension with periodic boundary conditions:\nL = Z0\n\nN\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u039b20\n\nN\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6a+1 |2 \u2212 \u03bc20\n\nN\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere we take N to be even and assume periodicity, hence \u03c6N +a = \u03c6a . It is convenient\nto allow for noncanonical normalization of the kinetic terms, and we thus display the\narbitrary wave-function renormalization constant Z0 .\n6\n\n\fIt is useful to consider L as a sum over 3-chains:\nL=\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nn odd\n\nLn,n+2\n\n(2.4)\n\nEach 3-chain involves three fields. The first 3-chain is:\n1\n1\nL1,3 = Z0 (|\u2202\u03c61 |2 +2|\u2202\u03c62 |2 +|\u2202\u03c63 |2 )\u2212\u039b20 |\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 |2 \u2212\u039b20 |\u03c62 \u2212\u03c63 |2 \u2212 \u03bc20 (|\u03c61 |2 +2|\u03c62 |2 +|\u03c63|2 )\n2\n2\n(2.5)\n2\nThe fields \u03c61 and \u03c63 share half their kinetic terms and \u03bc terms with the adjacent chains,\nthus carry the normalization factors of 1/2 within the chain (more generally, the endpoint\nfields may have s \u2212 1 links with other fields and thus carry 1/s factors in the kinetic\nand mass terms of each chain). \u03c62 can be viewed as a \"decoration\" of the chain. We can\nintegrate out the internal field \u03c62 and obtain an equivalent renormalized chain. Integrating\nout \u03c62 :\n1\n1\n1\nL1,3 = Z0 (|\u2202\u03c61 |2 +|\u2202\u03c61 |2 )\u2212(\u039b20 + \u03bc20 )(|\u03c61|2 +|\u03c63 |2 )+\u039b40 (\u03c61 +\u03c63 )\u2020\n(\u03c61 +\u03c63 )\n2\n2\n2\nZ0 \u2202 + 2\u039b20 + \u03bc20\n(2.6)\nExpanding in the derivatives and regrouping terms gives:\n1\n1\nL1,3 = Z1 (|\u2202\u03c61 |2 + |\u2202\u03c63 |2 ) \u2212 \u039b21 |\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c63 |2 \u2212 \u03bc21 (|\u03c61 |2 + |\u03c63 |2 ) \u2212 \u03b41 |\u2202(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c63 )|2 + O(\u2202 4 /\u039b2 )\n2\n2\n(2.7)\nwhere we obtain:\nZ1 =\n\u039b21 =\n\u03bc21 =\n\u03b41 =\n\n8\u039b40 + 4\u039b20 \u03bc20 + \u03bc40\nZ0 4\n\u2248 2Z0\n4\u039b0 + 4\u039b20 \u03bc2 + \u03bc40\n1\n\u039b40\n\u2248 \u039b20\n2\n2\n2\u039b0 + \u03bc0\n2\n2 2\n4\n2\u03bc0 \u039b0 + \u03bc0\n\u2248 \u03bc20\n2\u039b20 + \u03bc20\nZ0 \u039b40\n1\n\u2248 Z0\n2\n2 2\n(2\u039b0 + \u03bc0 )\n4\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe have written the approximate forms of the renormalizations of the parameters in the\nlarge \u039b limit. Note that the \u03bc2 term is multiplicatively renormalized. This owes to the\nfact that it is the true scale-breaking term in the theory when the lattice is taken very\nfine, and \u039b terms become derivatives, i.e., as \u03bc \u2192 0 the theory has a zero-mode. Since\n\nit alone breaks the symmetry of scale-invariance, elevating the zero-mode, it is therefore\nmultiplicatively renormalized in free field theory.\n7\n\n\fThe \u03b4 term has been written in the indicated form because, though it superficially\nappears to be a relevant d = 4 operator, it too is a quartic derivative on the lattice, i.e.,\n(\u2202 2 in 1 + 3) \u00d7(a nearest neighbor hopping term on the lattice). It effects only the high\nmass limit of the KK mode spectrum. It is therefore dropped for consistency with the\nexpansion to order \u2202 4 /\u039b2 .\nThe fields develop a new wave-function renormalization constant Z1 . Note that in\nthe \u039b >> \u03bc limit, Z1 \u2192 2Z0 , twice the original normalization. This renormalization is\ncommon to all the \u03c6a fields in the other chains. Thus, we can write the original theory\nwith N fields as a sum over the renormalized 2-chains, containing a total of N/2 fields:\nX\n\na=1\n\nN/2\n\nN/2\n\nN/2\n\nL \u2032 = Z1\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u039b21\n\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6a+1 |2 \u2212 \u03bc21\n\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe dropping of the |\u2202(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b )|2 terms, which appear to be superficially relevant, affects\nonly the high energy spectrum of eq.(2.9) when \u03bc = 0 in the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e and N \u2192 \u221e,\nholding M = \u039b/N fixed. To see this, we diagonalize eq.(2.3) to obtain the mass spectrum:\nm20 (n) = Z0\u22121 \u039b20 sin2 (\u03c0n/N) + Z0\u22121 \u03bc20\n\nn = (0, 1, .., N \u2212 1)\n\n(2.10)\n\nn = (0, 1, .., N \u2212 1)\n\n(2.11)\n\nDiagonalizing eq.(2.9) yields the mass spectrum:\nm21 (n) = Z1 \u039b21 sin2 (2\u03c0n/N) + Z1\u22121 \u03bc21\n\nand comparing with eqs.(2.8) we see that m21 (n) \u2248 m20 (n) for n << N, if we neglect the \u03bc2\n\nterms. The renormalized mass term Z1\u22121 \u03bc21 = (1/2)Z0\u22121 \u03bc20 , is halved by the dedecoration\ntransformation, and thus we have performed a scale transformation on the original theory.\nThe two spectra coincide in the small n limit of the scale-invariant theory with \u03bc2 = 0.\nViewed as a renormalization group, we see that the large N system flows under repeated application of dedecoration transformations to a block-spin thinned theory N \u2032 <<\nN with \u03bc \u2192 0, which is the scale invariant fixed point.\n2.1.2\n\nRenormalized 4-chains \u2192 2-chains\n\nWe will require in our applications presently the reduction of slightly more general 4chains, which are two endpoint fields and 2 internal decorating fields. We must allow for\na more general parameterization of the chain fields, since this structure will arise on the\nlattices of interest after a polygon-\u22c6 transformation (below). Generally, after performing\n8\n\n\fpolygon-\u22c6 transformations on our lattice, the full Lagrangian will be a sum over 4-chains\nof the form:\nLf ull =\n\nX\nn\n\nL4\u2212chain\nn\n\n(2.12)\n\nThese 4-chains will live on lattices with a coordination number s and generally have\ndifferent normalizations for the two endpoint fields than the two internal fields:\nL4\u2212chain =\n\n1\n1\nZ\u03a6 |\u2202\u03a61 |2 + Z\u03c6 |\u2202\u03c61 |2 + Z\u03c6 |\u2202\u03c62 |2 + Z\u03a6 |\u2202\u03a62 |2\ns\ns\n1 2\n\u2212 \u03bc0 (|\u03a61 |2 + s|\u03c61 |2 + s|\u03c62 |2 + |\u03a64 |2 )\ns\n\u2212\u039b\u20320 2 |\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c61 |2 \u2212 \u039b20 |\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 |2 \u2212 \u039b\u20320 2 |\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c62 |2\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe endpoint \u03a6i fields are shared with s \u2212 1 other neighboring chains, hence the Z\u03a6 /s\nkinetic term normalization, and the \u03bc20 /s factors. Furthermore, note the central link for\nthe internal fields, |\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 |2 , has a different strength \u039b0 2 6= \u039b\u20320 2 than the extremity links.\nWe integrate out the internal scalars \u03c61 and \u03c62 . This requires diagonalizing the \u03c61 -\u03c62\ninternal (mass)2 matrix, which has eigenvalues \u039b\u20320 2 and \u039b\u20320 2 + 2\u039b0 2 . We then regroup the\nderivative terms as before, discarding quartic and higher derivatives. We thus obtain a\nrenormalized 2-chain:\nL2\u2212chain =\n\nZ\u0303\n\u03bc\u03032\n(|\u2202\u03a61 |2 + |\u2202\u03a62 |2 ) \u2212 \u039b\u03032 |\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 |2 \u2212 (|\u03a61 |2 + |\u03a62 |2 ) + O(\u2202 4 /M 2 ) (2.14)\ns\ns\n\nwhere:\nZ\u0303 = Z\u03a6 + sZ\u039b\u20320 4\n\u039b\u0303\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\u03032\n\n\"\n\n1\n\u20322\n(\u039b0 + \u03bc0 2 )2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n1\n1 \u20324\n\u039b0\n\u2212\n=\n\u20322\n\u2032\n2\n(\u039b0 + \u03bc0 2 ) (\u039b0 2 + 2\u039b20 + \u03bc0 2 )\n(1 + s)\u039b\u20320 2 + \u03bc0 2\n= \u03bc0 2\n\u039b\u20320 2 + \u03bc0 2\n\n#\n\n(2.15)\n\nIt is useful to define the ratio \u03ba = \u039b\u20320 2 /\u039b20 and consider the large \u039b limit of these expressions:\nZ\u0303 \u2192 Z\u03a6 + Zs\n\u03ba\n\u039b\u03032 = \u039b\u20320 2\n(\u03ba + 2)\n2\n2\n\u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc0 (1 + s)\n9\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fWe will find that 4-chains arising after polygon-\u22c6 transformations on the truncated ssimplex lattices will have \u03ba = s.\nThe full Lagrangian after replacing the 4-chains by the 2-chains and summing over all\n2-chains, will take the form:\nLf ull = Z\u0303\n\nX\na\n\n|\u2202\u03a6a |2 \u2212 \u03bc\u03032\n\nX\na\n\n|\u03a6a |2 \u2212 \u039b\u03032\n\nX\na,b\n\n|\u03a6a \u2212 \u03a6b |2\n\n(2.17)\n\nNote that when the 2-chains are summed, the 1/s factors disappear in overall kinetic and\nmass term normalizations.\n\n2.2\n\nPolygon-\u22c6 Transformations\n\nLet us consider a \"complete\" deconstructed Lagrangian for a polygon of s sites. This is\na highly nonlocal structure of Fig.(3) in which all sites are linked to all other sites with a\ncommon bond strength:\nL\n\npolygon\n\ns\ns X\ns\nX\n1 2X\n2\n2\n|\u03c6a |2\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b | \u2212 \u03bc0\n|\u2202\u03c6a | \u2212 \u039b0\n= Z0\n2 a=1 b=1\na=1\na=1\ns\nX\n\n2\n\n(2.18)\n\nNote that we must be careful not to double count, the link |\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b |2 in double sums,\n\nhence the factors of 1/2. It is interesting to compute the mass spectrum of the perfect\npolygon by itself, going into the Fourier basis:\nX\n1 s\u22121\n\u03c6a = \u221a\ne\u03c0ika/s \u03c7n ;\ns k=0\n\nwhence:\nL = Z0\n\ns\u22121\nX\n\nk=0\n\n|\u2202\u03c7k |2 \u2212 s\u039b20\n\ns\u22121\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c6a+s = \u03c6a\n\n|\u03c7k |2 \u2212 \u03bc20\n\ns\u22121\nX\n\nk=0\n\n(2.19)\n\n|\u03c7k |2\n\n(2.20)\n\nNote the sum in the second term begins at k = 1, so the mode k = 0 is a zero mode when\n\u03bc = 0. Hence, renormalizing \u039b2 = \u039b20 /Z0 and \u03bc2 = \u03bc20 /Z0 , the spectrum, consists of s \u2212 1\n\u221a\ndegenerate modes of mass s\u039b2 + \u03bc2 , and the single mode of mass \u03bc with k = 0.\nThe polygon of s complex scalar fields admits a transformation which introduces a\ncentral complex scalar field \u03a6 and becomes the s-star with (s + 1) complex scalar fields.\nLet us consider the \u22c6 action in the form:\nL\u22c6 = Z\u03a6 |\u2202\u03a6|2 + Z\n\ns\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u039b\u20322\n\ns\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03a6 \u2212 \u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u03bc2\u03a6 |\u03a6|2 \u2212 \u03bc\u20322\n\n10\n\ns\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(2.21)\n\n\fNote that all |\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b |2 bonds have been deleted and we introduce new |\u03a6 \u2212 \u03c6a |2 bonds\nradiating from the central scalar \u03a6.\nStarting with L\u22c6 , we integrate out \u03a6:\nL\u22c6 = Z\n\ns\nX\na\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 (\u039b\u20322 + \u03bc\u20322 )\n\uf8ee\n\n+ \uf8f0\u039b\u20324\n\ns\nX\na,b\n\ns\nX\na\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\uf8f9\n\n1\n\u03c6b + h.c.\uf8fb\n\u03c6\u2020a\n2\nZ\u03a6 \u2202 + s\u039b\u20322 + \u03bc2\u03a6\n\n(2.22)\n\nPerforming the derivative expansion and reorganizing terms, we thus recover the polygon\nform of the Lagrangian:\n\u22c6\n\nL \u2192L\n\npolygon\n\n= Z0\n\ns\nX\na\n\ns\ns\nX\n\u22022\n1 2X\n2\n2\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b | \u2212 \u03bc0\n|\u03c6a |2 + O( 2 )\n|\u2202\u03c6a | \u2212 \u039b0\n2 a,b\n\u039b\na\n2\n\n(2.23)\n\nand we have the relations:\ns\u039b\u20324\nZ\u03a6\n\u2248\nZ\n+\n2\n(s\u039b\u20322 + \u03bc\u03a6 )2\ns\n\u20322\n\u20324\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u2248\n=\n2\n\u20322\n(s\u039b + \u03bc\u03a6 )\ns\n2\n\u20322\n\u20322\n(\u03bc\u03a6 + s\u03bc )\u039b + \u03bc2\u03a6 \u03bc\u20322\n(s + 1)\n=\n\u2248 \u03bc\u20322\n2\n\u20322\n(s\u039b + \u03bc\u03a6 )\ns\n\nZ0 = Z + Z\u03a6\n\u039b20\n\u03bc20\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere the approximate expressions hold in the large \u039b limit, and are all that we ultimately\nrequire to implement the renormalization group.\nNote that we have freedom within the L\u22c6 Lagrangian to vary the ratios Z\u03a6 /Z and\n\n\u03bc\u03a6 /\u03bc\u2032. We can for example, choose Z\u03a6 = 0, in which case \u03a6 is a nonpropagating auxiliary\nfield. The \u03a6 field will recover a kinetic term when subsequent chain transformations are\nperformed. The Z\u03a6 = 0 case is interesting for Yang-Mills, and corresponds to \"integrating\nin\" an infinite coupling constant gauge field, and the infinite coupling will run to a finite\nvalue after subsequent chain transformations. Presently we will make the convenient\nchoice \u03bc\u20322 = \u03bc2\u03a6 , but we do not specify explicitly Z\u03a6 /Z.

Consider any kth order s-simplex lattice built\nup recursively as described in Section I. For concreteness consider Fig.(4A), the second\norder 3-simplex.\nThe Lagrangian of the kth order lattice takes the form:\nL k = Z0\n\nNk\nX\n\na=1\n\n2\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a | \u2212\n\n\u039b20\n\nLk\nX\n\nlinks\n\n2\n\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b | \u2212\n\n\u03bc20\n\nNk\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(2.28)\n\nWe begin by performing the polygon-\u22c6 transformations on each of the elementary polygons. All of the elementary polygons are annihilated by this procedure, replaced by stars,\nand the lattice of Fig.(4A) is carried into that of Fig.(4B). The centers of the stars are connected to neighbors through 4-chains, and the full Lagrangian is now a sum over 4-chains.\n12\n\n\fWe have the 4-chain parameters determined by eq.(2.27):\nZ\u03a6\n+ Z = Z0\ns\n\u039b\u20322 = s\u039b20\n\u03bc\u20322 = \u03bc20\n\ns\ns+1\n\n(2.29)\n\nNow we reduce the 4-chains to 2-chains. The lattice is mapped from Fig(4B) into\nFig.(4C). We see that we have now reduced the original kth order lattice to the k \u2212 1\norder with the new Lagrangian:\n\nLk\u22121\n\nNk\u22121\n\nLk\u22121 = Z\u0303\n\nX\n\na=1\n\n2\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a | \u2212 \u039b\u0303\n\n2\n\nX\n\nlinks\n\nNk\u22121\n2\n\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b | \u2212 \u03bc\u0303\n\n2\n\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe parameters renormalize as in eq.(2.16) where \u03ba = \u039b\u20322 /\u039b2 = s. The resulting overall\nrenormalization is:\nZ\u0303 = sZ0\ns\n(s + 2)\n2\n= \u03bc0 s\nNk\n=\ns\n\n\u039b\u03032 = \u039b20\n\u03bc\u03032\n\u00d1 \u2261 Nk\u22121\n\n(2.31)\n\nWe have also noted the change in the number of fields, Nk . We see that the arbitrariness\nof choosing Z\u03a6 /Z (also, \u03bc\u03a6 /\u03bc\u2032 , which we fixed to unity) in the intermediate step is a\nhidden symmetry in the result.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nComputation of the Dimensionality\nVacuum Energy Scaling Law\n\nWe have described a theory of free complex scalars defined on the kth iteration of the\nkernel lattice. For the truncated-s-simplex lattices the coordination number is s, the\nnumber of fields in the kth iteration is Nk = (s + 1)(s)k and the number of links is\nLk = (s + 1)sk+1 /2. The Lagrangian is:\nL=Z\n\nNk\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u2202\u03c6a |2 \u2212 \u039b2\n\nLk\nX\na,b\n\n|\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b |2 \u2212 \u03bc2\n\n13\n\nNk\nX\n\na=1\n\n|\u03c6a |2\n\n(3.32)\n\n\fwhere the linking mass term sums over the links.\nIf we could Fourier transform eq.(3.32) we would obtain a mass spectrum of the form\nMn2\n\n= \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 . The path integral for our theory then takes the form in a Euclidean\nmomentum space, up to an overall multiplicative normalization factor:\n\u2212\u0393\n\ne\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c6 e\u2212\n\nR\n\nd4 xL\n\n=\n\nNk\nYY\n\n(Zp2 + \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 )\u22121\n\n(3.33)\n\np\u03bc n=1\n\nThe vacuum energy, or Coleman-Weinberg potential, is up to an overall additive constant:\n\u0393=Z\n\n\u22122\n\nZ\n\nd4 p X\nln(p2 + \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 )\n(2\u03c0)4 n\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhere we have rescaled the 4 momentum integral by Z.\nWe want to replace the sum on n by a continuous momentum integral. In any integer\ndimensionality, n is a vector, ~n = (nx , ny , ...). We want to perform the angular integral in\n\u221a\nthe sum over discrete ~n. This leaves a sum over the radial magnitude of n = ~n * ~n with a\ndimension-dependent measure. In \u01eb dimensions if we interpret n as the radial magnitude,\nthen in the continuous approximation to the sum we can replace:\nNk\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u2192\n\n1 Z Nk\ndn(n/Nk )\u01eb\u22121\n\u01eb 0\n\n(3.35)\n\nIn replacing the discrete sum by a continuous integral we will induce \"Casimir effect\"\ncorrections to the vacuum energy. These are discussed in the Appendix.\nWith n a radial coordinate, the leading behavior at low n of \u03c9n2 is \u03c9n2 \u223c c(n/Nk )2 \u039b2 ,\n\nwhere c is a constant (e.g., c = \u03c0 2 in a one dimensional periodically compactified situation). Let us rescale n to write the integral over an 4 + \u01eb dimensional momentum\nvector,\np2 = p\u03bc p\u03bc + c(n/Nk )2 \u039b2\n\n(3.36)\n\nThe Coleman-Weinberg potential becomes:\n\u0393 = c(\u01eb)\n\nZ \u22122 Nk\n\u039b\u01eb\n\nd4+\u01eb p\nln(p2 + \u03bc2 )\n(2\u03c0)4+\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n(3.37)\n\nHere c(\u01eb) is an overall normalizing factor coming from the c dependence, the ratio of the\nd = 4 to d = 4 + \u01eb solid angles and (2\u03c0)d normalizing factors. This factor is irrelevant for\nthe scaling argument, but given by:\n1 4\u03c0\nc(\u01eb) =\n\u01eb c\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u01eb/2\n\n14\n\n\u0393(2 + \u01eb/2)\n\n(3.38)\n\n\fThe integral, apart from the explicit scaling prefactor, is finite for nonzero \u01eb. It is thus\ninsensitive to k as k \u2192 \u221e to its UV cut-off limit and to \u039b \u2192 \u221e. We discuss this integral\nand the limiting procedure in greater detail in the Appendix. Performing the integral:\nZ \u22122 Nk\n(\u03bc)4+\u01eb V (\u01eb)\n\u0393=\n\u01eb\n\u039b\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere V (\u01eb) is insensitive to k as k \u2192 \u221e.\nThus, suppose we know the value of the parameters Z, \u03bc, \u039b and Nk for some large\nvalue of k. Then, we obtain the Coleman-Weinberg potential for k \u2212 1 by the sequence\nof RG transformations and we find new parameters:\nZ\u0303 = h(s)Z,\n\n\u03bc\u0303 = f (s)\u03bc,\n\n\u039b\u0303 = g(s)\u039b\n\nNk\u22121 = Nk /s.\n\n(3.40)\n\nSince V is insensitive to k for k \u2192 \u221e (and large \u039b) we have:\nZ \u22122\n\n(Z\u0303)\u22122 Nk\u22121 4+\u01eb\nNk\n4+\u01eb\n(\u03bc)\n=\n(\u03bc\u0303)\n\u039b\u01eb\n(\u039b\u0303)\u01eb\n\n(3.41)\n\n(f (s))4+\u01eb\ns(h(s))2 (g(s))\u01eb\n\n(3.42)\n\nor:\n1=\n\nand thus the dimensionality is determined as:\n\u01eb=\n\n3.2\n\n(\u22124 ln(f (s)) + ln(s) + 2 ln(h(s)))\nln(f (s)/g(s))\n\n(3.43)\n\nDimensionality and RG Invariants of the Trucated-s-simplex\nLattices\n\nLet us compute the dimensionality of the truncated s-simplex lattices. From eqs.(2.31)\nwe have:\ns\n\u221a\ns\nh(s) = s,\nf (s) = s,\ng(s) =\n.\n(3.44)\ns+2\nThe dimensionality is thus:\n\u01eb=\n\n2 ln(s)\nln(s + 2)\n\n(3.45)\n\nWe have recovered the result of Dhar for the dimensionality of spin-systems on the truncated s-simplex lattices. In Dhar's analysis of spins systems, the spins are static, i.e.,\nhave no kinetic terms in an auxiliary 1 + 3 dimensions. The wave-function renormalizations are essential in our present renormalization group and to the scaling law for the\n15\n\n\fColeman-Weinberg potential. Nonetheless, the lattice dimensionality is the same as in\nthe static spin system.\nNote that the coordination number must satisfy s > 2 for a nontrivial noninteger\ndimensionality. For s = 2 the dimension is always 1. For the truncated s-simplex lattices\nwe have 1 \u2264 \u01eb \u2264 2.\nThe scaling laws amongst the four quantities of eqs.(2.31) imply that there are 3\ninvariants. We have just encountered one invariant from the vacuum energy scaling law,\nand there are thus two others. We list them as follows:\nVr =\n\u03bc2r =\n\n(Z\u0303)\u22122 Nk\u22121 4+\u01eb\n(\u03bc\u0303)\n(\u039b\u0303)\u01eb\n\u03bc \u03032\n\nZ\u0303\nNr = Z\u0303 \u00d1\n\n(3.46)\n\nIt is useful to define a noninvariant renormalized cut-off:\n\u039b\u03032\n(3.47)\nZ\u0303\n\u039br can be used as the \"running\" mass scale, or identified with the energy scale of interest,\n\u039b2r =\n\nE \u223c \u039br .\nIn contrast to the case of the 3-chain\u21922-chain dedecoration acting on a chain of\nN scalars, the present RG transformation is not a scale transformation. We see that\nthe renormalized mass \u03bcr is invariant under the RG transformation. The present RG\ntransformation is a statement about the geometric recursive structure of the theory. This\nRG invariance of \u03bcr emboldens us to consider this as a symmetry of a novel continuum\ntheory.\nCombining \u03bcr with the RG invariant vacuum energy scaling factor Vr allows us to\ndefine yet another RG invariant mass scale:\nM=\n\n\u039b\u0303r\n(\u00d1)1/\u01eb\n\n(3.48)\n\nThe scale M is fixed in the large \u039br and \u00d1 limit, and has nothing to do with the physical\nmass \u03bcr . It defines the threshold scale of the KK-modes, i.e., the effective compactification\nscale of the theory. Comparing with the spherically symmetric measure in the integral of\neq.(3.35) we see that the number of KK modes with energy E is given by\nE\nn(E) =\nM\n\u0012\n\n16\n\n\u0013\u01eb\n\n(3.49)\n\n\fM is therefore the \"compactification\" scale of the noninteger extra dimension. The scale\nM persists in the \u03bc \u2192 0 limit. It is somewhat mysterious, in that we are taking a\n\nclassical theory to a continuum limit, yet a nontrivial RG invariant mass scale survives.\nIt is a consequence of the fact that the dimensionality is not trivial, i.e., \u01eb 6= 0 and a\nfundamental scale must survive since the trace of the stress tensor is presumably nonzero\nin this classical theory. In this sense, M is analogous to \u039bQCD .2 For us \u01eb is classical, while\nin QCD \u01eb \u223c \u03b2/g is an anomalous dimension.\nThe physical significance of the invariance of Z\u0303 \u00d1 pertains to interacting theories, such\nas Yang-Mills gauge theories. We can identify:\n1\ng2\n\nZ\u0303 \u221d\n\n(3.50)\n\na common dimensionless coupling constant of the deconstructed theory defined at the\nscale of the cut-off. Then the invariant M tells us how the coupling constant scales with\nchoice of cut-off. To see the running coupling constant scaling law combine eq.(3.48) and\neq.(3.50) to obtain:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE \u01eb\ng 2 (E) \u221d\n(3.51)\nM\nThus, we recover normal power-law running of g 2 (\u039br ) when \u01eb takes on integer values. The\nformula exhibits the generalization for noninteger dimension.\nWe have made a continuous approximation to the integrals, but we can always \"rediscretize\" the sum in an RG invariant way. The original choice of the definition of the\n\u221a\nenergy, \u03c9n = cn\u039b/Nk is not RG invariant. We see that the overall coefficient of the\nColeman-Weinberg potential in eq.(3.36) can be written as:\nZ \u22122 Nk\n(\u03bc)4+\u01eb = (\u03bcr )4+\u01eb M \u2212\u01eb\n\u039b\u01eb\n\n(3.52)\n\nHence, rediscretizing, we replace\nM \u2212\u01eb\n\nZ\n\nd4+\u01eb p I(p) \u223c\n\nand the energy of the nth mode is \u03c9n =\n\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\nd4 p\n\n(n)\u01eb\u22121 I(p\u03bc , \u03c9n )\n\nX\n\n(3.53)\n\nn\n\ncnM.\n\nThe difference between the rediscretized sum, taken to infinity, and the continuous\nintegral, is a Casimir effect. In the Appendix we show that the Casimir effect can be\n2\n\n\u039bQCD arises because the quantum \u03b2/g-function (the Gell-Mann\u2013Low \u03c8 function) is nonzero and acts\nas \u01eb, an \"anomalous dimension\" for the coupling constant, and hence the trace of the stress tensor is\nnonzero.\n\n17\n\n\fexpressed as a finite integral. The finite integral is vanishing when we assume that the\ntheory can be expressed in a 4+\u01eb dimensional Lorentz invariant way. It is not necessary to\nmake this strong assumption; the effects of the noninteger extra dimension may show up\nin an RG invariant way only at the threshold scale M, but have bad non-RG invariance\nat higher energies. This depends upon the physical interpretation of the theory. The\nfiniteness of the Casimir integrals suggest to us that a true RG invariant theory exists,\nand our construction for any finite order of k is just a regulator with RG-symmetry\nbreaking terms.\n\n4\n\nConsiderations of Gauge Fields and Fermions\n\nNaturally, we are interested in realistic models built along the lines suggested here. Thus\nwe will require Yang-Mills, and fermions, including chirality. The present discussion will\nbe qualitative, as we note some new issues that arise in attempting this extension.\nWhen we go over to theories involving fermions and Yang-Mills fields there are additional subtleties. These subtleties revolve around the polygon-\u22c6 transformation. For\nexample, Wilson fermions in a polygon cannot be mapped to the \u22c6 configuration. Similarly, the PNGB's of Yang-Mills theories that are periodically compactified must be lifted\nby plaquettes in order to perform the polygon-\u22c6 transformation. The point is that the\npolygon is orientable, while the \u22c6 is not, so orientational elements of the action will not\nbe carried through by the transformation. In the Yang-Mills case, an arbitrary magnetic\nR\nH\nflux threading a plaquette, B * dA \u223c A * dx cannot be represented by the \u22c6 form of the\naction, and this requires that a certain PNGB be infinitely heavy. The \u22c6 configuration,\nhowever, will be seen to be the key to creating chiral fermions. Chiral fermions in deconstruction are lattice defects. In the present case they must be incorporated as the centers\nof \u22c6 configurations that are invariant under the RG transformations used to reduce the\nlattice. In a sense then, chiral fermions are rarified defects, or invariant centers in the\nfractal lattice, similar to doping atoms in a material, or to the centers of snowflakes.\nYang-Mills gauge fields are introduced in a deconstructed theory by having gauge\ngroups, Ga , living on sites and linking-Higgs-fields defined on links. We also include\nplaquette terms which show up as mass terms of PNGB's in the 1 + 3 dimensions. Hence,\nlet us choose Ga = SU(N) with a common coupling constant g, and the link field \u03a6ab is\n\n18\n\n\f\u03a62\n\ng*\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03a63\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a61\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 5: The triangle-\u22c6 transformation for an irreducible plaquette maps \u03a6i \u2192 \u03c6j , but imposes\na constraint, \u03a63 \u03a62 \u03a61 = 1.\nthen an (N , N) chiral field with a VEV, h\u03a6i = vIN . The Lagrangian is then:\nLY M\n\nNk\nX\n\nLk\nPk\nX\nY\n1 a a\u03bc\u03bd X\n\u2020\n\u03bc\n=\u2212\nG\nG\n+\nTr[D\n,\n\u03a6\n]\n[D\n,\n\u03a6\n]\n+\n\u03bb\nTr[\n\u03a6ab ]\n\u03bc\nab\nab\nn\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nn=1 4g\nplaq n\nplaq n\n(ab)\n\n(4.54)\n\nThe irreducible plaquettes are those which do not encircle a subplaquette (i.e., can be\ncontracted). The irreducible plaquettes are Pk = (s + 1)k+1.\nLY M has been supplemented with a plaquette action, where each plaquette has a\ncoupling constant \u03bbk . Let us first consider \u03bbk = 0. Then the theory will contain a\nspectrum of 1 vector zero mode, Nk \u2212 1 massive gauge fields (KK-modes), and in tree\napproximation Lk \u2212 Nk + 1 massless PNGB's. The PNGB's will generally be lifted in\nperturbation theory to masses of order \u03b1M 2 , but they can also be elevated by turning on\nthe \u03bbk . Indeed, we see that Pk >> Lk , so including all irreducible plaquettes with large\n\u03bbn we can lift all PNGB's, except for a single zero-mode.\nLifting the PNGB's is necessary for the implementation of the \u22c6-chain RG. In Fig.(5)\nwe see a mapping of the irreducible triangle with link fields \u03a6i into a star configuration\nwith new link fields \u03c6j . The net gauge phase rotations in going from one site to another\nmust be faithfully represented under this redefinition, thus:\n\u03a61 = \u03c6\u20203 \u03c62\n\n\u03a62 = \u03c6\u20201 \u03c63\n\n\u03a63 = \u03c6\u20202 \u03c61\n\n(4.55)\n\nand we thus see that the \u03a6i are constrained:\n1 = \u03a63 \u03a62 \u03a61\n\n(4.56)\n\nThis is the orientability problem mentioned above. It requires the quantization of the\nWilson loop around the triangle plaquette g AA dxA = 2\u03c0n (more properly, \u03a63 \u03a62 \u03a61 must\nH\n\n19\n\n\flie in the center of the group). In the deconstruction language, it imposes a constraint\non the PNGB's. We can treat this constaint by introducing terms \u223c \u03bb123 Tr(\u03a63 \u03a62 \u03a61 )\n\nfor all elementary plaquettes, and we treat \u03bbn as a Lagrange multiplier, then perform\nthe polygon-\u22c6 transformation. This will lift the PNGB's from the spectrum. This is\nthe expected decoupling that of high mass PNGB's must occur when the short-distance\ndegrees of freedom are thinned. Thus, we expect that polygon-\u22c6 transformations should\nmake sense in the theory with plaquettes.\nAn intriguing point is that the \u22c6 Lagrangian involves \"integrating in\" additional YangMills gauge groups at the centers of stars with coupling constants g \u22c6 . As we saw in the star\ntransformation, there is a freedom to choose the wave-function renormalization constant,\nZ\u03a6 , arbitarily relative to its neighbors. This translates into the freedom of choosing the\ncoupling constant g \u2217 for the new central gauge group arbitrarily. In particular, we can\nchoose g \u2217 = \u221e, which completely suppresses the continuum kinetic term of the new gauge\nfield at this scale. The subsequent chain transformations will induce a finite coupling\nand gauge invariant kinetic term for this gauge field as we perform the 4-chain\u21922-chain\n\ntransformations. The renormalized couplings after the combined transformations for all\ngauge fields will have a common value and will run according to the scaling laws described\nin the previous section.\nBarring topological obstructions, we thus expect that the reduction for Yang-Mills\ngauge fields goes through in the Gaussian approximation. We obtain the same dimensionality as for complex scalars. Obviously the question of the effects of interactions is\nof great importance. We expect that there are 1 + 3 continuum renormalization group\neffects that accompany the lattice reduction, which corresponds to a change of scale (e.g.,\nof \u039br ). The main issue, however, comes from the power-law running in eq.(3.51). The\nYang-Mills coupling constant as described classically, will reach evolving upward with\nscale, a unitarity bound, g 2 \u223c (4\u03c0)2 at an effective scale \u039b\u22c6r fairly quickly (it would be in-\n\nteresting to construct models in which \u01eb << 1 where the power law running is suppressed,\nand appears approximately logarithmic). This is the scale of unitarity breakdown for longitudinal KK-mode scattering [3]. This would imply a phase transition in the theory,\npossibly the string transition. Another logical possibility is that g 2 runs large, but then\n\nis \"reset\" to a small value by a dynamical transition in the theory, then runs large again,\netc., leading to a limit cycle. With a limit cycle it may be possible to take \u039br \u2192 \u221e\nin the interacting theory as well, without a transition to the string phase. Perhaps the\nmost interesting possibility is that the theory has a UV fixed point [12], which may arise\n\n20\n\n\fbetween a competition of the classical running and the one-loop correction.\nFermions pose additional challenges. Fermions live on sites and will have kinetic\n\"hopping terms\" on the links. We can always view the lattice as a fermion mass matrix,\ntake all fermions to be vectorlike, and choose the hopping terms to be mass terms. This\nwould readily admit polygon-\u22c6 transformations and RG reduction of the lattice as we\nhave derived. This would seem to us to be a relatively uninteresting case.\nThe hopping terms should be built out of \u03b3 matrices. We expect that we require the use\nof all \u03b3 matrices through \u03b34+[s/2]) in construction of the action. Hence, for s = 2, \u03b35 suffices,\nsuch as in S1 , while s = 3 requires \u03b36 , etc. Consider the polygon of Fig.(5) for s = 3\nthe fermionic hopping terms around the perimeter of the polygon. Using \u03b35 , the hopping\nterms are of the form n v\u03c8 n \u03b35 \u03a6n \u03c8n+1 . Generally this form leads to the fermion doubling\nproblem [11], but admits polygon-\u22c6 transformations. It is most sensible to consider Wilson\nP\n\nfermions [11] (the Wilson fermion structure will always occur with SUSY). With Wilson\nP\nfermions the hopping terms are written as n (v\u03c8 nL \u03a6n \u03c8(n+1)R \u2212 v\u03c8 nR \u03c8nR ). The Wilson\nfermion hopping terms have a definite orientational sense, L(n) \u2192 R(n + 1), around the\n\npolygon. These cannot be reduced by polygon-\u22c6 transformations, and it is not clear to us\nthat sensible reducible fermionic actions exist which are compatible with the polygon-\u22c6\ntransformation. It should be borne in mind, however, that the polygon-\u22c6 transformation\nis ultimately a convenience in computing the dimensionality of the lattice. More exotic\nfermionic reductions that do not require the polygon-\u22c6 transformation may exist.\nIf we use an action with vectorlike fermions and fermionic Dirac mass matrix hopping\n\nterms, \u03a8a \u03a8b + h.c., we can still introduce chirality. We must construct \"invariant stars,\"\ni.e., dislocations in the lattice that are not reduced by the RG transformations as in\nFig.(6). At the center of the invariant star configuration we introduce a single chiral\nfermion, \u03a8L . The fermion has radial hopping terms to the perimeter fermions of the form\nv\u03a8L \u03c6n \u03c8nR . By \"doping\" a mass-matrix lattice with the appropriate number of chiral\ndislocations one can construct a fractal imbedding of the Standard Model.\nP\n\nn\n\n5\n\nPhysical Interpretations and Conclusions\n\nHow do we interpret these new theories physically? Fractional extra dimensions are not\nobviously compactified extra dimensions, since no global boundary condition is introduced\nwhich corresponds to a global compactification. Rather, we introduced initially a regulator, \u039b, which is our (inverse) lattice scale. We ultimately imagine the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e, but\n21\n\n\f\u03c8\n\nL\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\nFigure 6: The truncated 3-simplex lattice constructed with an invariant star dislocation for\nchirality. (A) Kernel (complete) lattice with coordination number 3 and a single chiral fermion\nattached to the upper lh site; (B) the first order decoration replaces each site under recursion\nexcept the invariant star; (C) the second order decorated lattice. A theory space can be constructed by defining each site to correspond to a vectorlike Standard Model, except the invariant\nstar which is the usual chiral Standard Model. Hopping terms involve gauge links and Dirac\nfermion mass terms, \u03c8 a \u03c8b + h.c.. The chiral fermions in the invariant star have chiral hops\n\u03c8 L \u03c8bR + h.c. to the vectorlike neighbors. The zero-mode structure of the theory is the chiral\nStandard Model.\n\nhow this limit is taken is dependent upon the physical interpretation of the theory. The\nanalogue of a compactified theory emerges with the determination of a compactification\nscale, the RG invariant M, and is a physical scale held fixed in the \u039b \u2192 \u221e limit. M would\n\nstill be present, however, with a different definition of the theory in which we maintain\na finite \u039b, and we may have a hierarchy M << \u039b, in analogy to the usual compactified\nextra dimensional theories.\nThere are thus two physical interpretations for these constructions. The first is an\n\"outer\" modification of spacetime. Here we have in mind finite \u039b but a dimensional\ntransition at the scale M << \u039b in which we view the continuous 1 + 3 dimensions as\na brane in a higher dimension with a surface structure with characteristic scale length\n1/M. This brane surface is viewed as dynamical, analogous to surfaces in condensed\nmatter physics, and may arise from an interface with an exterior region involving new\nphysics. The fractal theory space is an effective description of such a system on scales not\nfar above M. The fractality, in analogy with surface layers on material media, may arise\nbecause the interface with the extra outside dimensions involves a region of rapid change\nin physical parameters. In this picture Lorentz invariance at short distances strictly only\napplies to the 1 + 3 dimensions, but with \u039b large the relevant low energy physics of the\n22\n\n\fdimensional transition scale M is approximately Lorentz invariant in 1+(3+\u01eb) dimensions.\nIn this case, the scale \u039b may represent a further higher energy transition to string theory.\nTerms of order \u039b4 and \u039b2 \u03bc2 reflecting the finite cut-off will be present in the vacuum\nenergy, and are non-RG invariant. The low energy physics, however, is a fixed point\nunder these renormalizations that drastically change the UV part of the theory.\nThe alternative, and perhaps more intriguing view, is an \"inner\" modification of\nphysics, in that the scale M represents a true dimensional transition to 1 + (3 + \u01eb) dimensions, with enhanced Lorentz invariance on scales above M. In this case we take\n\u039b \u2192 \u221e. Then at all shorter distances the noninteger dimensionality is preserved. This is\na remarkable possibility in that a quantum field theory defined in 1 + (3 + \u01eb) dimensions\nwith irrational \u01eb is finite to all orders in perturbation theory. The cut-off scale \u039b can be\ntaken to infinity with impunity, holding M fixed as the defining dimensional transition\nscale.\nIf we were naive, we would speculate that we have given a prescription for the construction of finite quantum field theories of matter. Thus, all infinites in 1 + 3 dimensions of\nthe Standard Model would be associated with the cut-off scale M, which is the threshold\nfor new physics associated with the noninteger correction to the dimension of space-time.\nAbove the scale M we would begin to include KK-modes in accord with the energy distribution (E/M)\u01eb , and we would treat the field theory with 't Hooft\u2013Veltman dimensional\nregularization as the exact calculational tool for 4 + \u01eb dimensions. Thus, one way to treat\nthe Standard Model as a quasi-noninteger dimensional theory would be to replace all loop\nintegrals in 4-dimensions by 4 + \u01eb dimensions above a fixed matching scale M:\nLoops \u2192\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nM\n\nd4 k\n+ M \u2212\u01eb\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nM\n\nd4+\u01eb k\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(5.57)\n\nModulo ambiguities in treating \u03b3 5 , This theory is apparently finite above M to all orders\nin perturbation theory. We would infer some immediate physical consequences, e.g., that\nthe Higgs boson will receive radiative corrections to its mass from top quark loops:\nm2H \u223c \u2212\n\n3gt2 2\nM\n8\u03c0 2\n\n(5.58)\n\n(or heavier fermions in an extension of the model). Hence, we infer that M 2 is of order\n\u223c TeV (a \"Little Higgs\" model can raise the scale to \u223c 10 TeV through custodial chiral\nsymmetries).\n\nHowever, the power-law running of the coupling constant, g 2 \u223c (E/M)\u01eb with \u01eb > 0,\n\nimplies that either (1) the theory has a UV fixed point or (2) has a limit cycle or (3)\n23\n\n\fundergoes a phase transition at a strong coupling scale g 2 \u223c (4\u03c0)2 . In any case we\nmust account for gravity, and imbedding into string theory would seem to be the most\nsensible option. This prescription is nonetheless worthy of study, and is a \"continuous\nKK-mode distribution approximation\" to any theory that envelops the Standard Model\ninto a noninteger extra dimension \u01eb.\nWe have in mind other applications of these ideas. If the theories at lattice sites live in\n1+d continuous dimensions, then the full theory has 1+d+\u01eb dimensionality. For example,\nwith continuum 1 + 1 fields and very large s we can construct a flat 4 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 dimensional\n\neffective theory. Such theories are classically asymptotically free, but the log dependence\non s implies that it would be difficult to construct a natural lattice of the kind we have\nconsidered, since s must be taken unnaturally large. It is therefore of interest to enlarge\nthe space of recursively defined lattices to see if natural 4 \u2212 \u01eb dimensions make sense with\nvery small \u01eb.\nYet another interesting possibility is to deconstruct the string world-sheet. Weyl\ninvariance may be realized as a discrete RG invariance on a latticized world-sheet with\na continuum limit. Then we may be able to find unusual generalizations of the string\ntheory to fractal worldsheets. The consequences for the Weyl constraints on the target\nspace may be interesting.\nThe key result of this paper is that the renormalization group is dual to geometry.\nThe latter acts in space, and the former acts in theory space. The RG can then be used\nto reverse engineer unusual new geometries. These fractal geometries exploit quantum\nmechanics in their construction in a fundamental way. In fact, these realize some of\nthe recent speculations about deconstruction as a means of reconstructing spacetime [4].\nThough we are far from a complete theory, e.g., one including gravity, we believe this is\nfertile territory with potentially nontrivial implications beyond those considered presently.\n\n24\n\n\f6\n\nAppendix: Properties of the Vacuum Energy\n\nThe vacuum energy integral is most readily computed by differentiating wrt \u03bc2 . Define\n\u0393 = c(\u01eb)(Z \u22122 N/\u039b\u01eb )V (\u03bc2 ) where V (\u03bc2 ) is the Euclidean integral:\nV (\u03bc2 ) =\nThen:\n\n\u2202\nV (\u03bc2 ) =\n\u2202\u03bc2\n\nZ\n\nd4+\u01eb p\nln(p2 + \u03bc2 )\n4+\u01eb\n(2\u03c0)\n\nZ\n\n(6.59)\n\n1\nd4+\u01eb p\n1\n=\n(\u03bc)2+\u01eb \u0393(\u22121 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\n4+\u01eb\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) p + \u03bc\n(4\u03c0)2+\u01eb/2\n\n(6.60)\n\nTherefore, integrating wrt \u03bc2 , noting the integral vanishes for \u03bc = 0 for the 4 + \u01eb range\nof interest:\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\n1\n(\u03bc)4+\u01eb\n(6.61)\nV (\u03bc2 ) =\n2+\u01eb/2\n(4\u03c0)\n(2 + \u01eb/2)(1 + \u01eb/2)(\u01eb/2)(1 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\n\nThe integral can be performed directly, without differentiating, but is more tedious. In\n\nperforming the integral this way we have made two assumptions (1) The RG invariance\nholds for the system under the integral sign; (2) the integral is Lorentz invariant in\n4 + \u01eb dimensions. When these symmetries are imposed \"under the integral\" we have the\nRG invariant theory. Such strong assumptions, while the preferred interpretation of the\ntheory, are not necessary, however.\nIt is useful to consider the integral before we take the continuum limit. Suppose we\ndo not take the k \u2192 \u221e limit first and perform the integral with a cut-off. Consider, from\n\u221a\neq.(3.33) and eq.(3.34) the integral with cutoff K = c\u039b:\nVK\u2032 (\u03bc2 )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd4+\u01eb p\n1\n4+\u01eb\n2\n(2\u03c0) (p + \u03bc2 )\n\nK\n\n0\n\n(6.62)\n\nHere we have assumed that the finite cut-off is Lorentz invariant in 4 + \u01eb dimensions. We\nexponentiate the denominator:\nVK\u2032 (\u03bc2 ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b1\n\nZ\n\nK\n0\n\nd4+\u01eb p \u2212\u03b1(p2 +\u03bc2 )\ne\n(2\u03c0)4+\u01eb\n\n(6.63)\n\nThe p2 integral is then carried out, using the solid angle in d dimensions:\n2\u03c0 d/2\n\u0393(d/2)\n\n\u03a9d =\nwe have:\nVK\u2032 (\u03bc2 )\n\nZ \u221e\n1\nd\u03b1\n=\n(2\u03c0)2+\u01eb/2 0\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n25\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\u0013\n\nK2\n\n(6.64)\n\ndp2 (p2 )1+\u01eb/2 e\u2212\u03b1(p\n\n2 +\u03bc2 )\n\n(6.65)\n\n\fThe second term can be approximated:\n\u221e\n1\n2\n2\nd\u03b1(K 2 )2+\u01eb/2 e\u2212\u03b1(K +\u03bc )\n2+\u01eb/2\n(2\u03c0)\n0\n1\n(K 2 )2+\u01eb/2\n\u2032\n2\n\u2248 V (\u03bc ) \u2212\n(2\u03c0)2+\u01eb/2 K 2 + \u03bc2\n\nZ\n\nVK\u2032 (\u03bc2 ) = V \u2032 (\u03bc2 ) \u2212\n\n(6.66)\n\nhence,\nVK (\u03bc2 ) \u2248 V (\u03bc2 ) \u2212\n\n1\n\u03bc2 (K 2 )1+\u01eb/2 + O(K 2 )2+\u01eb/2\n(2\u03c0)2+\u01eb/2\n\n(6.67)\n\nThe procedure of considering VK\u2032 (\u03bc2 ) omitted the last quartically divergent piece (when\n\u01eb = 0), but keeps the quadratically divergent piece.\n\u221a\nThese additional terms are associated with the UV cut-off on the theory, \u039b = K/ c.\nHence they are not RG invariant. These terms do not obstruct our measurement of\nthe dimensionality of the system. If the system has finite k, then the dimensionality\nwe compute from the finite terms is \"effective,\" applying only near the threshold of KK\nmodes, \u223c M. The far UV spectrum can thus be considerably modified by the finite \u039b\neffects which do not respect the RG invariance.\nClearly we would like to argue that the 4+\u01eb dimensional theory exists, and the k \u2192 \u221e\nlimit can be taken. In this case, such terms can be viewed as the finite\u2013k regulator effect\nspoiling the symmetry of RG invariance in the true theory, much the way a momentumspace cut-off spoils gauge invariance. These terms vary under the RG transformation, so\nthey would be subtracted to define the symmetric theory, much as gauge invariance forces\nthe subtraction of the momentum-space cut-off mass term in the vacuum polarization\nloop. It is simpler to take the limit under the integral sign, since the resulting integral is\nfinite!\nCasimir effects arise in principle in the difference between the continuous approximation to the theory and the discretized sum. The form of these effects depends upon how\nwe define the theory, as described above, and will generally have divergences associated\nwith finite UV cut-off's that are not RG invariant. However, when we define the theory\nto be 4 + \u01eb Lorentz invariant and take the UV cut-off to infinity then the Casimir effects\nare vanishing.\nConsider the original discrete vacuum energy expression:\n\u0393 = Z \u22122\n\nZ\n\nd4 p X\nln(p2 + \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 )\n(2\u03c0)4 n\n26\n\n(6.68)\n\n\fThe Casimir effect is the difference between the continuum integral approximation and\nthe \"staircase\" in the discrete sum. This difference is minimized by the best fit continuous\napproximation to the staircase, but a leading residual contribution remains involving the\nsecond derivative of the summand. In our case the leading Casimir correction to the\ncontinuous approximation is:\n1 Z \u22122 c\u039b2\n\u03b4\u0393 =\n4 Nk2\n\nZ\n\n4\u03c9n2\nd4 p X\n2\n\u2212\n(2\u03c0)4 n (p2 + \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 ) (p2 + \u03c9n2 + \u03bc2 )2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(6.69)\n\nNote the factor of c\u039b2 /Nk2 arising from (\u2202\u03c9n /\u2202n)2 .\nWe rescale, and take the continuum Lorentz invariant limit the integral-sum goes over\nto a 4 + \u01eb dimesnional integral. We have, by the Euclidean invariance, \u03c9n2 = [\u01eb/(4 + \u01eb)]p2 .\nHence:\n1\nZ \u22122 Nk\n\u03b4\u0393 = c(\u01eb)\n2\n\u039b\u01eb\n\n!\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u0013\n2\u03bc2\nc\u039b2 Z d4+\u01eb p\n4\u2212\u01eb\np2\n+\nNk2\n(2\u03c0)4+\u01eb\n4 + \u01eb (p2 + \u03bc2 )2 (p2 + \u03bc2 )2\n\n(6.70)\n\nThe integral is readily performed:\n1\nZ \u22122 Nk (\u03bc)4+\u01eb\n\u03b4\u0393 = (\u01eb)\n2\n(4\u03c0)2+\u01eb/2 \u039b\u01eb\n\n!\n\nc\u039b2\n\u0393(\u22121 \u2212 \u01eb/2)\nNk2 \u03bc2\n!\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n4 + 3\u01eb\n4\u2212\u01eb\n+ (1 + \u01eb/2)\n4+\u01eb\n4+\u01eb\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n(6.71)\nIn this result we have the usual RG invariant prefactor Z \u22122 Nk (\u03bc)4+\u01eb /\u039b\u01eb . We also have\nan additional factor of \u039b2 /Nk2 \u03bc2 . which can be written in terms of invariants M and \u03bcr\nas: M 2 /Nk 2\u22122/\u01eb \u03bc2r . As we take the UV limit the number of sites grows as Nk \u2192 (s + 1)sk ,\n\nhence the prefactor term vanishes in this limit. Higher order Casimir corrections will\ninvolve higher powers of Nk in the denominator of the prefactor. The Casimir corrections\nto the vacuum energy are thus vanishing to all orders when the theory is defined as a 4 + \u01eb\nLorentz invariant continuum theory.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank K.
