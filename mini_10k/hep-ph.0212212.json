The analysis of these results [1, 2] in\nterms of neutrino oscillations have largely improved our knowledge of neutrino mixing\non the LMA region. The results appear to confirm in a independent way that the\nobserved deficit of solar neutrinos is indeed due to neutrino oscillations. The ability\nto measure the LMA solution, the one preferred by the solar neutrino data at present,\n\"in the lab\" puts Kamland in a pioneering situation: after these results there should\nremain little doubt of the physical reality of neutrino mass and oscillations.\nThe publication of the SNO results [3, 4] has already made an important breakthrough towards the solution of the long standing solar neutrino [5\u20137] problem\n(SNP) possible. These results provide the strongest evidence so far (at least until Kamland improves its statistics) for flavor oscillation in the neutral lepton sector. From the combined analysis of SNO and other solar evidence, one obtains, in\nthe framework of two active neutrino oscillations, the following set of parameters,\n+0.10\n\u22125\n2\n2\n\u2206m2solar = 4.5+2.7\n\u22121.4 \u00d7 10 eV , tan \u03b8solar = 0.40\u22120.08 . We will see in this work how\nthe evidence from the Kamland measurements improves or modifies these values.\nThe previous generation of reactor experiments (CHOOZ [8], PaloVerde [9]),\nperformed with a baseline of about 1 km. They have attained a sensitivity of\n\u2206m2 < 10\u22123 eV 2 [8, 10] and, not finding any disappearance of the initial flux, they\ndemonstrated that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly [11] is not due to muon-electron\nneutrino oscillations. The Kamland experiment is the successor of such experiments\nat a much larger scale in terms of baseline distance and total incident flux. This\nexperiment relies upon a 1 kton liquid scintillator detector located at the old, enlarged, Kamiokande site. It searches for the oscillation of antineutrinos emitted by\nseveral nuclear power plants in Japan. The nearby 16 (of a total of 51) nuclear power\nstations deliver a \u03bd e flux of 1.3 \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 for neutrino energies E\u03bd > 1.8 MeV\nat the detector position. About 85% of this flux comes from reactors forming a well\ndefined baseline of 139-344 km. Thus, the flight range is limited in spite of using\nseveral reactors, because of this fact the sensitivity of Kamland increases by nearly\ntwo orders of magnitude compared to previous reactor experiments.\nThe aim of this work is to study the implications of the recent Kamland results\non the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters, to understand which\nregions of the parameter space still allowed by the solar neutrino experiments are\nfavored by them. The structure of this work is the following. In section 2 we discuss\nthe main features of Kamland experiment that are relevant for our analysis: The\nsalient aspects of the procedure we are adopting and the results of our analysis are\npresented and discussed in section 3. Finally, in section 4 we draw our conclusions\nand discuss possible future scenarios.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nThe computation of the expected signals\nThe Kamland signal\n\nElectron antineutrinos from nuclear reactors with energies above 1.8 MeV are measured in Kamland by detecting the inverse \u03b2-decay reaction \u03bd e + p \u2192 n + e+ . The\ntime coincidence, the space correlation and the energy balance between the positron\nsignal and the 2.2 MeV \u03b3-ray produced by the capture of a already-thermalized neutron on a free proton make it possible to identify this reaction unambiguously, even\nin the presence of a rather large background.\nThe two principal ingredients in the calculation of the expected signal in Kamland\nare the reactor flux and the antineutrino cross section on protons. A number of short\nbaseline experiments (See Ref.[12] and references therein) have previously measured\nthe energy spectrum of reactors at distances where oscillatory effects have been shown\nto be nonexistent. They have shown that the theoretical neutrino flux predictions\nare reliable within 2% [13]. The effective flux of antineutrinos released by the nuclear\nplants is a rather well understood function of the thermal power of the reactor and the\namount of thermal power emitted during the fission of a given nucleus, which gives\nthe total amount, and the isotopic composition of the reactor fuel which gives the\nspectral shape. Detailed tables for these magnitudes can be found in Ref. [12]. For a\ngiven isotope the energy spectrum can be parametrized by an exponential expression\n[14] where the coefficients depend on the nature of the fissionable isotope (see Ref.[12]\nfor explicit values). Along the year, between periods of refueling, the total effective\nflux changes with time as the fuel is expended and the isotope relative composition\nvaries. We take the average of the relative fission yields over the live time as given\nby the experiment: 235 U = 57%, 238 U = 7.8%, 239 P u = 30%, 241 P u = 5.7%.\nIn order to obtain the expected number of events at Kamland, we sum the expectations for all the relevant reactor sources weighting each source by its power and\ndistance to the detector (table II in Ref. [12] ), assuming the same spectrum originated from each reactor. We sum over the nearby power reactors, we neglect farther\nJapanese and Korean reactors and even farther rest-of-the-world reactors which give\nonly a minor additional contribution. The average number of positrons Ni which are\ndetected per visible energy bin \u2206Ei is given by the convolution of different quantities:\nP , the oscillation probability averaged over the distance and power of the different\nreactors. Expressions for the antineutrino capture cross section are taken from the\nliterature [14, 15]. The matrix element for this cross section can be written in terms\nof the neutron half-life, we have used the latest published value t1/2 = 613.9 \u00b1 0.55\n[16]. The antineutrino flux spectrum, the relative reactor-reactor power normalization which is included in the definition of P and the energy resolution of Kamland\nare used in addition. We use in our analysis the following expression for the energy\n\n3\n\n\fresolution in the prompt positron detection\n\u221a\n\u03c3(Ee ) = 0.0062 + 0.065 Ee .\n\n(1)\n\nThis expression is obtained from the raw calibration data presented in Ref.[17]. Note\nthat we prefer to use this expression instead of the much less accurate one given in\nRef.[1]. Moreover, we assume a 408 ton fiducial mass and standard nuclear plant\npower and fuel schedule, we take an averaged, time-independent, fuel composition\nequal for each detector as given above. Detection efficiency is taken close 100% and\nindependent of the energy [1].\nWe will not add any background events as they (a total of 0.95\u00b10.99 events which\ninclude random coincidences from radioactive decays, < 0.01 evts, and correlated\nbackground from cosmic ray muons and neutrons, < 0.5 events,) can be distinguished\nfrom the signal with sufficiently high efficiency or are negligible above the 2.6 MeV\nanalysis threshold (table I in Ref. [1]). We also consider negligible the background\nfrom geological neutrinos above the 2.6 MeV analysis threshold.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Solar Signal\n\nWe also need the expected signals in the different solar neutrino experiments. These\nare obtained by convoluting solar neutrino fluxes, sun and earth oscillation probabilities, neutrino cross sections and detector energy response functions. We closely follow\nthe same methods already well explained in previous works [5, 18\u201320], we will mention\nhere only a few aspects of this computation. We determine the neutrino oscillation\nprobabilities using the standard methods found in literature [21], as explained in\ndetail in [18] and in [5]. We use a thoroughly numerical method to calculate the\nneutrino evolution equations in the presence of matter for all the parameter space.\nFor the solar neutrino case the calculation is split in three steps, corresponding to\nthe neutrino propagation inside the Sun, in the vacuum (where the propagation is\ncomputed analytically) and in the Earth. We average over the neutrino production\npoint inside the Sun and we take the electron number density ne in the Sun by\nthe BPB2001 model [31]. The averaging over the annual variation of the orbit is\nalso exactly performed. To take the Earth matter effects into account, we adopt a\nspherical model of the Earth density and chemical composition [22]. The joining of\nthe neutrino propagation in the three different regions is performed exactly using an\nevolution operator formalism [21]. The final survival probabilities are obtained from\nthe corresponding (non-pure) density matrices built from the evolution operators in\neach of these three regions.\nIn this analysis in addition to night probabilities we will need the partial night\nprobabilities corresponding to the 6 zenith angle bin data presented by SK [23].\nThey are obtained using appropriate weights which depend on the neutrino impact\n\n4\n\n\fparameter and the sagitta distance from neutrino trajectory to the Earth's center,\nfor each detector's geographical location.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis and Results\n\nIn order to study power of the Kamland results for resolving the neutrino oscillation\nparameter space, we have developed two kind of analysis. In the first case we deal\nwith the Kamland measured global signal. In the second case we include the full\nKamland spectrum information. We perform a complete \u03c72 statistical analysis before\nand after including in addition the up-date solar evidence obtaining the regions in\nthe parameter space which are favored.\n\n3.1\n\nAnalysis of the Global rate\n\nThe total \u03c72 value is given by the sum of two distinct contributions, that is the\none coming from all the solar neutrino data and the contribution of the Kamland\nexperiment:\n\u03c72 = \u03c72\u2299 + \u03c72glob,KL ,\nwith\n\u03c72glob,KL\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nRexp \u2212 Rteo (\u2206m2 , \u03b8)\n\u03c3stat+sys\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe \"experimental\" signal ratio is Rexp = 0.611 \u00b1 0.085 \u00b1 0.041 [1], where the first\nerror is statistical and the second one systematic.\nThe solar neutrino contribution can be written in the following way:\n\u03c72\u2299 = \u03c72glob + \u03c72SK + \u03c72SNO .\n\n(3)\n\nThe function \u03c72glob correspond to the total event rates measured at the Homestake experiment [24] and at the gallium experiments SAGE [25, 26], GNO [27] and\nGALLEX [28]. We follow closely the definition used in previous works (see Ref.[5] for\ndefinitions and Table (1) in Ref.[5] ' for an explicit list of results and other references).\nThe contribution to the \u03c72 from the SuperKamiokande data (\u03c72SK ) has been obtained by using double-binned data in energy and zenith angle (see table 2 in Ref.[23]\nand also Ref.[29]): 8 energy bins of variable width and 7 zenith angle bins which include the day bin and 6 night ones. The definition is given by:\n\u0001\u22121 th\n2\n2\n\u03c72SK = (Rth \u2212 Rexp )t \u03c3unc\n+ \u03c3cor\n(R \u2212 Rexp ).\n(4)\nThe theoretical and experimental R quantities are this time matrices of dimension\n8\u00d77. The covariance quantity \u03c3 is a 4-rank tensor constructed in terms of statistic\n\n5\n\n\ferrors, energy and zenith angle bin-correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties. The\ndata and errors for individual energy bins for SK spectrum has been obtained from\nRef. [23].\nThe contribution of SNO to the \u03c72 is given by\nX\n\u0001\u22121 th\n2\n2\n\u03c72spec\u2212SNO =\n(Rth \u2212 Rexp )t \u03c3stat\n+ \u03c3syst\n(R \u2212 Rexp ),\n(5)\nd,n\n\nwhere the day and night R vectors of dimension 17 are made up by the values of the\ntotal (NC+CC+ES) SNO signal for the different bins of the spectrum. The statistical\ncontribution to the covariance matrix, \u03c3stat , is obtained directly from the SNO data.\nThe part of the matrix related to the systematical errors has been computed by us\nstudying the influence on the response function of the different sources of correlated\nand uncorrelated errors reported by SNO collaboration (see table II of Ref. [4]), we\nassume full correlation or full anticorrelation according to each source.\nTo test a particular oscillation hypothesis against the parameters of the best fit\nand obtain allowed regions in parameter space we perform a minimization of the two\ndimensional function \u03c72 (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8). A given point in the oscillation parameter\nspace is allowed if the globally subtracted quantity fulfills the condition \u2206\u03c72 =\n\u03c72 (\u2206m2 , \u03b8) \u2212 \u03c72min < \u03c72n (CL). Where \u03c72n=2 (90%, 95%, ...) are the quantiles for two\ndegrees of freedom.\nIn Figs.1 we graphically show the results of this analysis. The favored region\nby the Kamland global rate alone is presented in fig.1(Left). Fig.1(right) includes\nthe full Kamland and Solar contributions. Kamland global rate alone restricts the\nvalue of tan2 \u03b8 to be in the range tan2 \u03b8 > 4 \u00d7 10\u22121 \u2212 1 (symmetric with respect\nthe value \u03b8 = \u03c0/4) except for some small region corresponding to tan2 \u03b8 \u223c 1 and\n\u2206m2 \u223c 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 . The overall effect of the measured observed ratio R \u223c 0.6%\nis that the LMA region remains the only one which is still favored. Only if Kamland\nshould had measured a ratio \u223c 0.1\u2212 0.3, more than three sigma away from the actual\nmeasurement, other regions as the LOW solar solution would have some statistical\nchance to survive. In Table (I.a) we present the best fit parameters or local minima\nobtained from the minimization of the \u03c72 function. Also shown are the values of\n\u03c72min . According to these results, regardless of the individual Kamland results, a\nmaximal mixing solution is excluded when solar data is included in the analysis.\n\n3.2\n\nAnalysis including the full Kamland signal\n\nHere we use the binned Kamland signal (See table 2 extracted from Fig.5 in Ref.[1])\ncombined with the evidence of the up-date solar experiments (CL,GA,SK and SNO).\nThe total \u03c72 value is given now by the sum of two distinct contributions, that is the\none coming from all the solar neutrino data and the contribution of the Kamland\n\n6\n\n\fexperiment which includes both, shape and total signal information:\n\u03c72 = \u03c72\u2299 + \u03c72spec,KL + \u03c72glob,KL .\n\n(6)\n\nThe contributions of the solar neutrino experiments \u03c72\u2299 and global Kamland signal\nare described in detail in the previous section. The contribution of the Kamland\nspectrum is now as follows:\n2\n2\n\u03c72spec,KL = (\u03b1Rth \u2212 Rexp )t \u03c3unc\n+ \u03c3corr\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n(\u03b1Rth \u2212 Rexp )\n\n(7)\n\nThe total error matrix \u03c3 is computed as a sum of assumed systematic deviations,\n\u03c3sys /S \u223c 6.5%, mainly coming from flux uncertainty (3%), energy calibration and\nthreshold (see table II of Ref. [1] for a total systematic error \u223c 6.4%), see also Ref.[12,\n17, 30]) and statistical errors. The parameter \u03b1 is a free normalization parameter.\nThe effect of systematic sources on individual bin deviations has been computed by\nus studying the influence on the response function, furtherly we have assumed full\ncorrelation among bins.\nNote that, as an alternative to the previous formula 7 based on ratios and using\nand standard \u03c72 expression, we could have directly used the absolute number of events\nin each bin and applied poissonian statistics formulas. The Kamland collaboration\nin its published analysis uses a mixed strategy and divides the \u03c72 expression in\ntwo parts: it adds a standard \u03c72 contribution corresponding to the global rate to\na likelihood contribution which models the statistical significance of the spectrum\nshape. In this work, where we are interested not only on the Kamland data itself but\nin combining it with the solar data, we prefer to continue using the familiar expression\n7 for various reasons: first, for simplicity, clarity and comparability with previous and\nfuture results, second, in the major part of the bins, certainly in the most significant\nones, the signal is high enough, and more importantly the errors are small enough,\nto use the Gaussian approximation. For the large energy bins the signal is strictly\nzero: its contribution is anyway effectively zero in both approaches. Finally, not less\nimportantly, the possibility of introducing in our approach in a straightforward way\nthe effect of correlated systematic deviations among bins.\nThe R are length 13 vectors containing the binned spectrum (0.425 MeV bins\nranging from 2.6 to 8.125 MeV) normalized to the non-oscillation expectations. Theoretical vectors are a function of the oscillation parameters: Rth = Rth (\u2206m2 , \u03b8).\nThe experimental vectors Rexp contain the Kamland binned signal. We generate\nacceptance contours (at 90,95 and 99 % CL) in the (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8) plane in a similar\nmanner as explained in the previous section including now a minimization respec the\nparameter \u03b1 for any of the other oscillation parameters. For the sake of comparison we have also obtained exclusion regions derived from the consideration of the\nKamland contribution alone (\u03c72KL = \u03c72spec + \u03c72gl ).\n\n7\n\n\fIn Figs.(2) we graphically show the results of this analysis. The first case, study\nof the Kamland data alone (\u03c72KL ) is represented by the Fig.(2)( left). The allowed\nregions in parameter space corresponding to each particular point is formed by a\nnumber of regions symmetric with respect the line tan \u03b8 = 1. The general effect of\nthe inclusion of the solar evidence, showed in Fig.2 (right), in the \u03c72 is the breaking\nof the symmetry in tan2 \u03b8, as expected, and the strong contraction of the allowed\narea to well defined regions. The best fit parameters obtained from the minimization\nof the \u03c72 function are presented in Table (I.a) where two well separated solutions\nappear LMAI,LMAII. In both cases the mixing angle is around tan2 \u03b8 \u223c 0.45 \u2212 0.48.\nAgain, the introduction of the solar data strongly diminishes the favored value for\nthe mixing angle. The final value is more near to those values favored by the solar\ndata alone than to the Kamland ones. This effect could be simply due to the present\nlow Kamland statistics or, more worrying, to some statistical artifact derived from\nthe complexity of the analysis and of the heterogeneity of binned data involved.\nIn this respect, we perform additionally a second kind of analysis in order to\nobtain concrete values for the individual oscillation parameters and estimates for\ntheir uncertainties. We study the marginalized parameter constraints where the \u03c72\n2\n2\nquantity is converted into likelihood using the expression L = e\u2212(\u03c7 \u2212\u03c7min )/2 . This\nnormalized marginal likelihood, obtained from the integration of L for each of the\nvariables, is plotted in Figs. (3) for each of the oscillation parameters \u2206m2 and\ntan2 \u03b8. For tan2 \u03b8 we observe that the likelihood function is strongly peaked in a\nregion tan2 \u03b8 \u223c 0.4 \u2212 0.6. The situation for \u2206m2 is similar except for the existence of\nadditional, somehow narrower, secondary peaks. Concrete values for the parameters\nare extracted by fitting one- or two-sided Gaussian distributions to any of the peaks\n(fits not showed in the plots). In both cases, for angle and the mass difference\ndistributions the goodness of fit of the Gaussian fit to each individual peak is excellent\n(g.o.f > 99.8%) thus justifying the consistency of the procedure. The values for the\nparameters obtained in this way appear in Table (I.b). They are fully consistent and\nvery similar to the values obtained from simple \u03c72 minimization. In particular, the\nmaximal mixing solution is again excluded at the \u223c 3\u03c3 level.\nAlthough both are mutually compatible, the slight difference of the value obtained\nfor the mixing angle is well explained by the shape of the allowed regions in Fig 2\n(right): the right elongation of these makes the value of the integral which defines\nthe marginal distribution for tan2 \u03b8 to be shifted. Additional variability can be easily introduced if would have used different prior information or different parameter\ndefinition (i.e. sin 2\u03b8 instead of tan2 \u03b8). This an example of how the details of statistical analysis can significantly modify the values of the physical parameters extracted\nfrom data and how important is that different methods are explored, specially in\nthe present context of neutrino physics where heterogeneous data coming from very\ndifferent sources is jointly used.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe have analyzed the present experimental situation of our knowledge of the neutrino\nmixing parameters in the region of the parameter space that is relevant for solar\nneutrinos and we have studied in detail how this knowledge has improved with the\nrecent results presented by the reactor experiment Kamland. We show, how, in\ngeneral, the regions selected by Kamland alone, all symmetric with respect to tan2 \u03b8 =\n1, have a large spreadth in the mixing angle. The experiment has, however, a much\nhigher sensitivity to the mass difference parameter.\nKamland global rate alone restricts the value of tan2 \u03b8 to be in the range tan2 \u03b8 >\n4 \u00d7 10\u22121 \u2212 1 (symmetric with respect the value \u03b8 = \u03c0/4) except for some small region\ncorresponding to tan2 \u03b8 \u223c 1 and \u2206m2 \u223c 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 . The overall effect of the\nmeasured observed ratio R \u223c 0.6% is that the LMA region remains the only one\nwhich is still favored. Only if Kamland should had measured a ratio \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.3,\nmore than three sigma away from the actual measurement, other regions as the LOW\nsolar solution would have some statistical chance to survive.\nFrom the analysis of the Kamland evidence alone, the allowed regions in parameter\nspace corresponding to each particular point is formed by a number regions symmetric\nwith respect the line tan \u03b8 = 1. The general effect of the inclusion of the solar evidence\nin the analysis is the breaking of the symmetry in tan2 \u03b8, the strong reduction of the\narea of the allowed regions and, more importantly, the shifting of the value of the\nbest fit mixing angle from being compatible with maximal mixing to more than 3\u03c3\nincompatibility.\nIn addition to parameter extraction from \u03c72 minimization, we obtain concrete\nvalues for the individual oscillation parameters and estimates for their uncertainties\nfrom the marginalized likelihood distributions. For tan2 \u03b8 we observe that the likelihood function is concentrated in a region slightly higher that that one obtained from\nminimization. According to this analysis, maximal mixing is again excluded at the 3\u03c3\nlevel. The marginal distribution for \u2206m2 shows clearly the existence of an additional,\nsomehow narrower and much less significant, secondary peaks. Kamland, after only\n150 days of data taking, together with the rest of solar experiments is already able to\nresolve the neutrino mass difference with a high precision of \u03b4\u2206m2kl+solar < \u00b10.8 to be\ncompared with the solar only case where the precision obtained was \u03b4\u2206m2solar < \u00b11.5.\nThe situation for the other oscillation parameter is worse, from the present data we\nobtain \u03b4 tan2 \u03b8kl+solar < \u00b10.15. This precision is comparable, in fact even worse,\nthan the precision attainable from the solar data alone \u03b4 tan2 \u03b8solar < \u00b10.10 [5]. The\nperspectives of Kamland, after 1-3 years of data taking, together or not with solar\nevidence, for a much better determination of the mixing angle are not very optimistic\n(see the results in Ref.[15]). The ability of experiments as BOREXINO to improve\nthe determination of the mixing angle with a smaller error in the near future remains\n\n9\n\n\fan open question (see Ref.[32]).\nIn summary, in the framework of two active neutrino oscillations we obtain, combining Kamland and Solar data and assuming CPT invariance, i.e. the same mass\nmatrix for neutrino and antineutrinos, the following values for neutrino mixing parameters \u2206m2kl = 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV 2 , tan2 \u03b8kl = 0.47 from \u03c72 minimization (LMAI solution).\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge the financial support of the Italian MURST and the Spanish CYCIT\nfunding agencies.

The\ncurves are in arbitrary units with normalization to the maximum height. Values for the peak\nposition are obtained by fitting two-sided Gaussian distributions (not showed in the plot). Dashed\nlines delimit \u00b11\u03c3 error regions around the maximum. See Table I.a for values of the position and\nwidths of the peaks.\n\n16\n\n\f"}
