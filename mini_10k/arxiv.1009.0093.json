Color Glass Condensate\nIn heavy ion collisions, the vast majority of the produced particles have a\ntransverse momentum of at most a couple of GeV's. This implies that they\nare produced from incoming partons that carry a very small fraction x of\nthe longitudinal momentum of the projectiles. Furthermore, this momentum\nfraction decreases with the center of mass energy of the collision. At RHIC\nenergy, the typical value of x is of the order of 10\u22122 for the bulk of particle\nproduction, and of order x \u223c 4.10\u22124 at the LHC. However, at such small\nvalues of x, the gluon density in a proton or nucleus becomes large which\nleads to a new phenomenon known as gluon saturation, due to non-linear\nrecombinations among the gluons. Gluon saturation is characterized by an\nx-dependent momentum scale, the saturation momentum Qs (x), that delimitates the domain in momentum where saturation takes place. This domain\nis represented in the figure 1.\nHaving identified this region where nonlinear gluon interactions become\nimportant, one faces now the question of how to compute physical observables reliably in this regime where one collides projectiles made of a very\nlarge number of constituents. The main novelty in the saturated regime,\ncompared to the dilute one, is that the typical particle production processes\ninvolve multiple gluon interactions, as shown in the figure 2. The standard\nperturbative techniques based on Feynman diagrams are well suited to handle the dilute situation, but they become impractical in the saturated regime\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A\n\nNovember 3, 2018\n\n\ft\n\nlog(x -1)\n\nfreeze out\nhadrons\ngluons & quarks in eq.\ngluons & quarks out of eq.\nstrong fields\n\nkinetic theory\nideal hydro\nviscous hydro\nclassical dynamics\n\nz\n\u039bQCD\n\nlog(Q 2)\n\nFigure 1: Left: Saturation domain in the x, Q2 plane.

In\naddition, in order to compute observables in this dense regime, we also need\nto know the probability to find these multigluon states in the wavefunctions\nof the incoming nuclei.\nThe Color Glass Condensate is an effective description of QCD in the\nsaturation regime. In this effective theory, one divides the degrees of freedom\n(see the figure 3) into fast partons with longitudinal momentum k + > \u039b+ ,\nand slow partons with k + < \u039b+ that have a significant dynamical evolution\nover the time-scales of the reaction of interest [1].

Therefore, their\n2\n\n\fdescription in the CGC is simplified into a distribution of static color currents\nJ \u03bc = \u03b4 \u03bc+ \u03c1(x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) (this is for a projectile moving in the +z direction).\nOn the contrary, this approximation does not work for the slow degrees of\nfreedom, and therefore we must keep describing them as conventional gauge\nfields A\u03bc . Due to the separation in longitudinal momentum between these\ntwo types of degrees of freedom, their coupling is eikonal, A\u03bc J \u03bc . Thus, the\neffective Lagrangean of the CGC is:\n1\nL = \u2212 tr F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + (J1\u03bc + J2\u03bc ) A\u03bc .\n}\n| {z }\n| 2 {z\ngluon dynamics fast partons\n\nThis description would not be complete without a way to specify the color\ncharge density \u03c1(x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ). This distribution depends on the precise configuration of the fast partons (e.g. their localization in the transverse plane at\nthe time of the collision), which is not known. Thus, it should be considered\nas a stochastic quantity, with a probability distribution W\u039b+ [\u03c1]. The distribution W\u039b+ [\u03c1] plays in the CGC the same role as partons distributions in\nconventional low density perturbative QCD.\nThe CGC effective theory introduces a cutoff \u039b+ that separates the fast\nand the slow degrees of freedom. However, this cutoff is unphysical and one\nshould ensure that physical observables do not depend upon it. It turns out\nthat for this to be true, the probability distribution W\u039b+ [\u03c1] must evolve with\n\u039b+ according to the JIMWLK equation [2],\nZ\n\u2202W\u039b+\n\u03b4\n1\n\u03b4\n= H W\u039b+ , H =\n\u03b7(x\u22a5 , y \u22a5 )\n,\n+\n\u2202 ln(\u039b )\n2\n\u03b4\u03b1(y \u22a5 )\n\u03b4\u03b1(x\u22a5 )\nx\u22a5 ,y \u22a5\n\nwhere \u2212\u2202 2\u22a5 \u03b1(x\u22a5 ) = \u03c1(1/\u039b+ , x\u22a5 ). Effectively, the JIMWLK equation resums\nto all orders the powers of \u03b1s ln(\u039b+ ) (or, equivalently, powers of \u03b1s ln(1/x)),\nand its kernel \u03b7(x\u22a5 , y \u22a5 ) includes all corrections in the color source \u03c1. When\napproximated to low density by expanding the kernel to lowest order \u03c1, one\nrecovers the BFKL equation that describes the evolution to low x of nonintegrated gluon distribution of a dilute hadron.\n2. Just before the collision: factorization\nA high energy heavy ion collision can be divided in several successive\nstages, as shown in the figure 1. The CGC applies to the description of the\n3\n\n\fwavefunctions of the incoming projectiles, to the collision itself, and to a brief\ntime after the collision, of the order of \u03c4 \u223c Q\u22121\ns . Since the subsequent stages\nare usually described by some form of relativistic fluid dynamics, one of the\nCGC goals is to provide the value of the energy momentum tensor at some\ninitial time \u03c40 . But more fundamentally, since the CGC provides a QCDbased description of the early stages of heavy ion collisions, it is also the\nframework to be used in order to justify the applicability of hydrodynamics.\nIn the CGC, the energy-momentum tensor admits an expansion in powers\nof the strong coupling g 2. However, because the color sources are strong in\nthe saturated regime, this expansion starts by a term in g \u22122 ,\nT\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\ni\nQ4s h\n2\n4\n= 2 c0 + c1 g + c2 g + * * * .\ng\n\nThe coefficients c0,1,2,*** in this expansion are themselves infinite series in g\u03c1\n(which is parametrically of order one in the saturated regime), and therefore\neach order corresponds to an infinite series of Feynman diagrams.\nAt leading order, one can prove that the sum of the corresponding set of\ndiagrams can be expressed in terms of classical solutions of the Yang-Mills\nequations [3],\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n= g \u03bc\u03bd F \u03bb\u03c3 F\u03bb\u03c3 \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bb F \u03bd \u03bb ,\nTLO\n4\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\nD\u03bc , F \u03bc\u03bd = J \u03bd ,\n{z\n}\n|\n\nlim A\u03bc (t, x) = 0 .\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nYang\u2212Mills equation\n\nThese equations are non-linear and in general one cannot find analytic solutions. However, they have been solved numerically to obtain e.g. the initial\nenergy density released in a collision [4].\nAt next to leading order, the energy-momentum tensor starts being sensitive to the slow gluon fields of the CGC effective theory, via a loop correction.\nIt is convenient to consider only one small slice of these slow modes, located\njust below the original cutoff \u039b+\n0 of the CGC, as shown in the figure 4. The\nfields\n\nsources\n\n\u039b1+ \u039b0+\n\u03b4TNLO\n\nP+\n\nk+\n\nTLO\n\nFigure 4: Slice of slow modes at NLO.\n\n4\n\n\fcontribution of this slice can be calculated at leading log accuracy [5],\n\u0012 \u2212\u0013\nh \u0012 \u039b+ \u0013\ni\n\u039b0\n0\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b4TNLO = ln\nH1 + ln\nH2 TLO\n,\n\u2212\n\u039b+\n\u039b\n1\n1\nwhere H1,2 are the JIMWLK Hamiltonians of the two projectiles. Thanks\nto their form that does not mix the two projectiles, these logarithms appear\nto be intrinsic properties of the wavefunctions of the two nuclei. Therefore,\nthey can be absorbed by defining a new CGC effective theory that has its\ncutoff at the lower values \u039b+\n1,\n\u0012 \u00b1\u0013\nD\nE\nD\nE\nh\ni\n\u039b0\n\u00b1\nT LO + \u03b4T NLO\n= T LO\n, W\u039b1 \u2261 1 + ln\nH1,2 W\u039b\u00b10 ,\n\u039b0\n\u039b1\n\u039b\u00b1\n1\nprovided the distribution of sources in the new effective theory is defined as\nprescribed by the JIMWLK equation. This process can be iterated, until the\ncutoffs become smaller than the physically relevant scales. The outcome of\nthis procedure is the following formula for the energy-momentum tensor,\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 \u0003 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nhT (\u03c4, \u03b7, x\u22a5 )iLLog =\nD\u03c11 D\u03c12 W1 \u03c11 W2 \u03c12 TLO\n(\u03c4, x\u22a5 ) ,\nwhich resums all these logarithms. Note that at this level of accuracy, the\nrapidity dependence of the left hand side comes entirely from the JIMWLK\nevolution of the distributions W of the two projectiles. Besides its usefulness in heavy ion collisions, this factorization is important because it establishes a bridge between nucleus-nucleus collisions and other reactions such as\nelectron-nucleus collisions, where distributions W with the same JIMWLK\nevolution also appear. Let us also stress that this factorization also applies to\nany sufficiently inclusive observables. In particular, the correlation between\nthe components of the energy-momentum tensor measured at different points\nin space [5] reads\nhT \u03bc1 \u03bd1 (\u03c4, \u03b71 , x1\u22a5 ) * * * T \u03bcn \u03bdn (\u03c4, \u03b7n , xn\u22a5 )iLLog =\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 \u0003 \u03bc1 \u03bd1\n\u03bcn \u03bdn\n=\nD\u03c11 D\u03c12 W1 \u03c11 W2 \u03c12 TLO\n(\u03c4, x1\u22a5 ) * * * TLO\n(\u03c4, xn\u22a5 ) .\nOne sees that at leading log accuracy, all these correlations come from the\nW 's (since the integrand is a product of n independent factors). This formula\npredicts a correlation in rapidity over a range of order \u2206\u03b7 \u223c \u03b1s\u22121 , since this\nis the rapidity variation necessary to produce a change in the W 's.\n5\n\n\fBz\nEz\n\n4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n2\n\nBT\n\n2\n\n2\n\n[(g \u03bc) /g ]\n\n0.8\n\nET\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n2\ng \u03bc\u03c4\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 5: Left: field components evaluated by solving numerically the Yang-Mills equations\n(from [6]). Right: longitudinal color flux tubes.\n\n3. Just after the collision: Glasma fields\nImmediately after the collision, the chromo- E and B fields have only\nlongitudinal components [6], forming flux tubes along the collision axis (see\nthe figure 5). This configuration of color fields has been named the glasma.\nThe typical transverse size of a flux tube is of order Q\u22121\ns , and the color fields\nare correlated over \u03b1s\u22121 units of rapidity in the longitudinal direction.\nThis particular topology of the post-collision color fields has several consequences, among which a peculiar form of the energy-momentum tensor (see\nsection 4), the fact that the multiplicity distribution is a negative binomial\n[7], and the existence of a non-zero topological density F Fe, possibly at the\norigin of observable CP violating effects [8]. But the most direct and striking\nconsequence of these structures, when taken as initial conditions for hydrodynamical expansion, is that they lead to the formation of the so-called ridge\ncorrelations, a structure in the 2-hadron spectrum which is elongated in \u2206\u03b7\nand narrow in \u2206\u03c6 (see the left plot of the figure 6). By examining the causal\nrelation between two particles separated in rapidity (right part of the figure 6), one can see that the process responsible for producing a correlation\nbetween these particles must have taken place at early times,\ntcorrelation \u2264 tfreeze\n\n1\n\nout\n\ne\u2212 2 |\u03b7A \u2212\u03b7B | .\n\nSince the color fields produced at early times in the CGC formalism are\ncorrelated over rapidity intervals of order \u03b1s\u22121 \u226b 1, they provide a natural\nexplanation for the rapidity dependence of the ridge [9].

The fact that the longitudinal pressure is negative\nis problematic for a smooth matching to hydrodynamics, because it means\nthat the CGC energy-momentum tensor is quite far from the form for which\nquasi-ideal hydrodynamics is applicable (i.e. one where the spatial part of\nthe tensor is not too far from being proportional to the identity).\nIt has been known for some time that corrections to the leading order\nCGC prediction suffers from secular divergences. Indeed, the solutions of\nclassical Yang-Mills equations are usually unstable, as noticed in several\nworks [10]. This implies that the next to leading order correction to the energy momentum tensor calculated in the CGC framework grows with time,\nand eventually becomes larger than the leading order. It is possible to resum\na subset of these higher order corrections, that at each loop order picks up\nthe most singular of these contributions. This resummation amount to superimposing a fluctuation to the initial condition at \u03c4 = 0+ for the classical\nglasma field [11],\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0002 \u0003\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTresummed (\u03c4, \u03b7, x\u22a5 ) =\nD\u03c11 D\u03c12 Da F [a] W1 [\u03c11 ] W2 [\u03c12 ] TLO\n[ A\n+ a} ]\n| {z\ninitial field\n\nwith a Gaussian distribution F [a] for this fluctuation. The effect of this resummation has not been fully investigated in the context of the CGC due to\nsome technical difficulties that preclude a straightforward numerical evaluation of the previous formula. However, it is possible to devise a scalar toy\nmodel where the effect of such fluctuations can be studied.

Right:\nevolution with initial fluctuations.\n\nextremely simple in this toy model, we discard any spatial dependence, so\n8\n\n\fthat the classical equation of motion reads\n1\n\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 \u22072\u22a5 \u03c6 + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0 ,\n\u03c4\nand we take a quartic potential V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c64 . The term \u03c6\u0307/\u03c4 is due to longitudinal expansion in the rapidity direction, as would be the case in a collision\nprocess. The time evolution is started at some some initial proper time\n\u03c4 = \u03c40 , and we average the energy-momentum tensor over Gaussian fluctuations of the initial field. We first did this toy calculation without fluctuations\nof the initial field (see the left plot of the figure 8) and there one sees that\nthe pressure oscillates with time: there is no single-valued relationship between the energy density and the pressure, which means that there is no\nequation of state in this case. In the right plot of the figure 8, we show the\neffect of the initial field fluctuations: the oscillations of the pressure are now\ndamped, and it relaxes towards \u01eb/3 \u2013 which is the equation of state expected\nfor a scale invariant theory in four dimensions. Moreover, one also observes\nthat the energy density decreases as \u03c4 \u22124/3 , which is the expected behavior in\nhydrodynamics if the longitudinal pressure is \u01eb/3. Thus, in this toy model,\nit appears that the fluctuations of the initial field play a crucial role in the\nrelaxation of the system towards hydrodynamical behavior.\nConclusions\nThe Color Glass Condensate provides a first principles framework to study\nthe early stages of high energy nuclear collisions, that involve gluons in the\nsaturated regime. It correctly describes the energy density released in such\na collision, as well as important features of the correlations observed in the\nfinal state. In this context, the most pressing and challenging question for\nfuture work is arguably that of thermalization.\nAcknowledgements: This work is supported in part by Agence Nationale\nde la Recherche via the programme ANR-06-BLAN-0285-01.\nReferences\n[1] L.D.
