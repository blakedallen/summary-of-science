We give a Mikhlin multplier theorem for a class of nonhomegenous dilations in plane,\nand study singular kernels that have a flag type singularity along the parabola y = cx2 . We show that\nthe multiplier of these operators consists of two distinct parts, one which is essentially the Fourier\ntransform of the flat kernel, and another, which is characterized by its highly oscillatory factor that\nsignifies the curvature of the singular support of the kernel. This characterization can be used to\nstudy the behaviour of this class on various function spaces. For example the Lp boundedness of\nthe corresponding operator on 1 < p < \u221e will be a trivial corollary..\n\n1. Introduction\nThe standard theory of singular integral operators has been generalized to apply to certain wider\nclasses of operators in two main directions. One, in connection to the singular Radon transform\noperators, whose kernels are supported on curved subvarieties. The pinnacle of this study was the\npaper of Christ, Nagel, Stein, Wainger [1]. The other generalization, arises in connection to the product\ntheory of singular intgeral operators, where the singularity is carried on a flag of linear subvarieties,\nas suggested by speculations on problems in several complex variables. The paper of Nagel, Ricci,\nStein [3] offers an extensive study.\nIn this article, we combine the two directions, in a special case, to study a class of operators that have\nsingularities along a specific curved flag. These operators can also be viewed as a generalization of the\nclassical operator of the Hilbert transform along the parabola, in the context of curved flag kernels.\nWe study the Fourier transform of such kernels, obtaining the exact form in one region, characterized\nby a very specific oscillatory factor, and establishing the smoothness in the rest of the plane. As a\ncorollary of the form of the multiplier, we can also show the Lp boundedness of the corresponding\nclass of operators for 1 < p < \u221e. The paper of Secco [5] contains a direct proof of this corollary.\nWe will use the theory developed by Nagel, Ricci, and Stein cf. [3], in the special case of R2 where we\nhave assigned the homogeneous dimensions 1,2 to x and y directions respectively. Also, in this special\ncase we will be dealing with the following two filtrations of R2 :\nflag F1 :\n\n0 = V0 \u2282 V1 = R \u00d7 0 \u2282 V2 = R2 ,\n\nflag F2 :\n\n0 = V0 \u2282 V1 = 0 \u00d7 R \u2282 V2 = R2\n\nSo in this setting a product kernel is a distribution M on R2 that coincides with a C \u221e function M\naway from the coordinate axes, which also satisfies the following decay and cancellation condirions:\n(1)(Differential inequalities)\nFor each pair of integer indices \u03b1, \u03b2, there is a constant C\u03b1,\u03b2 such that\n|\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202y\u03b2 M (x, y)| \u2264 C\u03b1,\u03b2 |x|\u22121\u2212\u03b1 |y|\u22121\u2212\u03b2\nfor any normalized bump functions \u03c6, \u03c8 each of the two families\nR(2)(Cancellation conditions)\nR\nM (x, y)\u03c6(Rx)dx and M (x, y)\u03c8(Ry)dy are uniformly bounded families of CZ kernels on R\n\nA flat flag kernel with respect to flag F1 is a distribution M on R2 that coincides with a C \u221e function\nM away from the x-axis, which satisfies the following differential inequalities: for y 6= 0,\n|\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202y\u03b2 M (x, y)| \u2264 C\u03b1,\u03b2 (|x| + |y|1/2 )\u22121\u2212\u03b1 |y|\u22121\u2212\u03b2\nas well as the same cancellation conditions we imposed on product kernels. [3]\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHADI JOR\u00c1TI\n\nSo, basically, a flag kernel with respect to this flag coincides with a product kernel in the region\nwhere |x|2 \u2265 c|y|, and a Calderon-Zygmund kernel with respect to the corresponding weights in the\nremainder of the plane: |y| \u2265 c|x|2 .\nNotice that any product kernel can be written as a finite sum of flag kernels (cf. [3]) and that the\nsum of a flag kernel with another flag kernel with respect to a coarser filtration is a flag kernel with\nrespect to the finer flag. In particular, the sum of a Calderon-Zygmund kernel and any flag kernel is\na flag kernel of the same kind.\nOur main results are the following two dual theorems that characterize a class of singular kernels\nthat behave naturally under a specific class of nonhomegenuous dilations in R2 , giving a new kind\nof Mikhlin multiplier type condition. There is also a rather precise asymptotic relation between the\ndifferent terms.\nTheorem 1.1. If M is a flat flag kernel with respect to the flag F1 and K is the curved version,\nK(x, y) = M (x, y \u2212 c0 x2 ), and m the Fourier transform of K, then m is a bounded function which is\nsmooth away from \u03be-axis, and there is a natural decomposition for it:\n\n(1.1)\n\nm(\u03be, \u03b7) = F.T.{M (x, y \u2212 c0 x2 )}(\u03be, \u03b7) = L1 (\u03be, \u03b7) + \u03a6(\u03be, \u03b7)eic\n\n\u2032 \u03be2\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7 1/2\nL2 (\u03be, \u03b7)\n\u03be\n\nwhere each Li is a flat flag multiplier with respect to the flag F1 , \u03a6 is a smooth cut off function\n1\nsupported on the region where |\u03be| \u2265 c|\u03b7| 2 .\n\nTheorem 1.2.

The best such constants C, {C\u03b1 } are called CZ\nseminorms.\nWe call a family of CZ kernels {ki }i , a uniformly bounded family, if for any finite number of CZ\nseminorms k.k\u03b1 , the family {kki k\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2264N is uniformly bounded: kki k\u03b1 \u2264 C for \u03b1 \u2264 N , with C\nindependent of i.\nIt\nto check that if k is a Calderon-Zygmund kernel on R, then, for each \u03b1, the family\n\b \u03b1is \u03b1easy\n\u03b4 \u2202\u03b4 k \u03b4 \u03b4>0 is a uniformly bounded family of CZ kernels.\nAlso, the following trivial corollary will be handy: If m is a Calderon-Zygmund multiplier on R then,\nfor each \u03b1, the family {\u03b4 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b4\u03b1 m\u03b4 }\u03b4 is a uniformly bounded family of Calderon-Zygmund multipliers.\n\nAs a model case we first study a generalization of the operator of Hilbert transform on the parabola\nwhere we have replaced the homogeneous kernel 1t with a general 1-dimensional CZ kernel k:\nTk (f )(x, y) := f \u2217 Kk (x, y)\nb \u03be 2 )).\nck (\u03c6) = k(\u03c6(\u03be,\nwhere Kk is defined as: Kk (\u03c6) := k(\u03c6(x, x2 )). So K\nBut, every Calderon-Zygmund kernel in dimension one is in the following form (see e.g. [7]): k =\nlim\u01eb\u21920,N \u2192\u221e k\u01eb,N + c\u03b4 where \u03b4 is the \u03b4-function at zero, and k\u01eb,N are C \u221e functions supported in the\nshell between radii \u01eb and N , with uniformly bounded CZ semi-norms.\nHence\n\nBut\n\nb\nK(\u03c6)\n=\n\nlim\n\n\u01eb\u21920,N \u2192\u221e\n\nZ \u001aZ Z\n\nb\nb \u03be 2 )) = \u03c6(0,\nb 0) =\n\u03b4(\u03c6)\n= \u03b4(\u03c6(\u03be,\n\n2\n\ne\u22122\u03c0i(tx+t\n\nZ Z \u001aZ\n\ny)\n\n\u001b\nb\n\u03c6(x, y)dxdy k\u01eb,N (t)dt + c\u03b4(\u03c6)\n\n2\n\ne\u22122\u03c0i(tx+t\n\ny)\n\n\u001b\nZZ\n\u03b4(t)dt \u03c6(x, y)dxdy =\n\u03c6(x, y)dxdy\n\nThus the whole expression representing the Fourier transform of Kk is equal to:\n\u001b\nZ Z \u001aZ\n2\ne\u22122\u03c0i(tx+t y) { lim\nk\u01eb,N (t) + c\u03b4}dt \u03c6(x, y)dxdy\n\u01eb\u21920,N \u2192\u221e\n\nSo if we call the multiplier of this operator mk (\u03be, \u03b7), in slack notation, mk is given by the following\nintegral:\nZ \u221e\n2\nmk (\u03be, \u03b7) =\ne\u22122\u03c0i(t.\u03be+t .\u03b7) k(t)dt\n\u2212\u221e\n\nBy this we mean, mk (\u03be, \u03b7) = lim\u01eb\u21920,N \u2192\u221e m\u01eb,N + c, where m\u01eb,N is the Fourier transform of k\u01eb,N .\nLemma 2.1. If P is a polynomial of degree d, and K := {k\u03b1 }\u03b1 is a uniformly bounded family of CZ\nkernels,\nZ\n| eiP (t) k\u03b1,\u01eb,N (t)dt| \u2264 cd,K\nwhere cd,K is a constant depending only on d, the degree of P , and the uniform bounds of the CZ\nseminorms of {k\u03b1 } but not on the coefficients of P , or \u01eb, N .\n\n\f4\n\nHADI JOR\u00c1TI\n\nAn earlier version is due to Stein and Wainger [9].\nProof. We can see, without loss of generality, that we can assume P is monic. Indeed, if it is not, we\ncan perform a change of variables, rescaling the variable appropriately, to make it monic, while this\nchange of variables replaces any kernel k\u03b1,\u01eb,N with a dilated version of it, and hence leaving the CZ\nseminorms unchanged.\nBreak up the integral into two parts: the part near zero, and the part near infinity. First we treat\nthe part near zero. We do this by induction on d, the degree of polynomial P . For deg(P ) = 1, the\nclaim is equivalent to the well known fact that the Fourier transform of a Calderon-Zygmund kernel\nis bounded. For the inductive step put P (t) = td + Q(t) and we have:\nZ 1\nZ 1\nZ 1\nd\neiP (t) k(t)dt =\n[eit \u2212 1][k(t)eiQ(t) ]dt +\neiQ(t) k(t)dt\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nThe second integral satisfies the condition by induction hypothesis, and the first integral can be written\nin this form:\nZ 1\ntd \u03c8(t)k\u01eb,N (t)dt\n\u22121\n\nwhere \u03c8 is a smooth bounded function through the interval. So the integrand is bounded, and\nintegrated over a bounded interval it will produce a number that is bounded above, uniformly in \u01eb\nand N . The integral near infinity is bounded, as can be seen by applying Van der Corput lemma of\norder d. \u0003\nFrom this theorem it immediately follows that, mki (\u03be, \u03b7) is a uniformly bounded family of functions\non the (\u03be, \u03b7) plane. Just plug in P (t) = 2\u03c0(\u03bet + \u03b7t2 ) in the previous theorem.\nLemma 2.2. The limit mk (\u03be, \u03b7) = lim\u01eb\u21920,N \u2192\u221e m\u01eb,N (\u03be, \u03b7) exists and is a C \u221e function for \u03b7 6= 0.\nProof. This is rather standard but for the sake of completeness here is a proof. We introduce\n\"parabolic\" polar coordinates a, \u03b4: (\u03b4, \u03b4 2 ) \u2297 (a, 1) = (\u03be, \u03b7). So for the upper half-plane, \u03b7 > 0, we\n\u03be\n, \u03b4 = \u03b7 1/2 If \u03b7 6= 0, then \u03b4 6= 0 too, and it is\nhave: \u03b4a = \u03be, \u03b4 2 = \u03b7,\nor equivalently\na = \u03b71/2\nobvious that the expression is smooth in \u03b4 on the region \u03b4 6= 0. So there only remains the question of\n \u0304\nsmoothness in a. Notice that mk (\u03be, \u2212\u03b7) = mek (\u03be, \u03b7) where e\nk(x) := k(\u2212x).\nSo from now on we restrict\nour attention to \u03b7 > 0 only. We start with k = k\u01eb,N . After a suitable change of variables we have:\nZ \u221e\n2\nmk (\u03be, \u03b7) =\ne\u2212i(at+t ) k \u03b4 (t)dt\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIntroducing smooth cut-off functions \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 , supported near \u2212\u221e, 0, \u221e respectively, we can write\nmk (\u03be, \u03b7) as this sum:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u22121\nZ 1\n2\n2\n2\ne\u2212i(at+t ) k \u03b4 (t)\u03c63 (t)dt\ne\u2212i(at+t ) k \u03b4 (t)\u03c61 (t)dt +\ne\u2212i(at+t ) k \u03b4 (t)\u03c62 (t)dt +\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u22121\n\nFirst we treat the\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\nR\u221e\n1\n\n1\n\npart. The integral near \u2212\u221e is similar.\n\ne\u2212i(at+t ) k \u03b4 (t)\u03c6(t)dt =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u221e\n\nd \u2212i(at+t2 )\ni\n{e\n}\nk \u03b4 (t)\u03c6(t)dt =\ndt\na + 2t\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\ne\u2212i(at+t\n\n)\n\nd\ni\n{\nk \u03b4 (t)\u03c6(t)}dt\ndt a + 2t\n\nContinue integrating by parts and if we do it enough times we see that we have an absolutely convergent integral that decays in a faster than any desired negative power of a, so the expression is\ninfinitely differentiable in a. Also it is clear from the definition that each of these integrals is infinitely\ndifferentiable in \u03b4 for \u03b4 6= 0. The integral near zero is the Fourier transform of a compactly supported\ndistribution so it is smooth.\nNotice that all estimates are independent of \u01eb and N , thus we can pass to the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, N \u2192 \u221e,\ngetting the result for k. \u0003\n\n\fON A CLASS OF CURVED FLAG MULTIPLIERS\n\n5\n2\n\nWe will now state a lemma, fully describing the asymptotics of the Fourier transform of eix k(x), for\nan arbitary CZ kernel k. This lemma was generously provided to us by Elias Stein [6].\nLemma 2.3. If k is a Calderon-Zygmund kernel on R, define\nZ \u221e\n2\ne\u22122\u03c0ixt e\u2212\u03c0it k(t)dt\n(2.1)\nIk (x) :=\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\nthen, Ik (x) is a C function of x and it can be written as: Ik (x) = A(x) + e\u2212i\u03c0x B(x), where, for\nx \u2192 \u221e, we have: A(x) \u223c b\nk(x)\nand\nB(x) \u223c k(x)\nMore precisely, for x \u2192 \u221e, we have the following full asymptotic expansions:\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\nc\u2032 j \u2202x2j k(x)\nk(x)\n,\nB(x) \u223c\ncj \u2202x2j b\nA(x) \u223c\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nProof. Start with a partition of unity, separating the point zero, and infinity. Let \u03b7 be a C \u221e\nfunction, that is identically equal to 1 on |x| \u2264 12 , and identically equal to zero, on |x| \u2265 1. Put\n\u03b70 := \u03b7 \u03b7\u221e := 1 \u2212 \u03b70 . Decomposing k accordingly: k = k0 + k\u221e\nk0 := \u03b70 k , k\u221e := \u03b7\u221e k\nObserve that, on |x| \u2265 C, kb0 (x) is C \u221e , and kc\n\u221e (x) is a Schwartz function.\n\nThat is because k0 is compactly supported so its Fourier transform is infinitely differentiable. Also,\nR \u221e \u22122\u03c0ixt\nwe have: kc\n\u03b7\u221e (t)k(t)dt But since \u03b7\u221e is supported a distance away from zero, the\n\u221e (x) = \u2212\u221e e\nintegral is rapidly decreasing in x, as can be seen by repeated integration by parts.\n\nIt follows from this observation that on the region |x| \u2265 1 we have: kb0 (x) = b\nk(x) + \u03c6, for some\n\u221e\nc\nc\nb\nSchwartz function \u03c6; and similarly for k\u221e (x) for x small, k\u221e (x) \u2212 k(x) is a C function on |x| \u2264 1.\n\nFirst we observe that I(x) is indeed a smooth function of x. Using the decomposition we just gave,\nput Ik (x) = Ik\u221e (x) + Ik0 (x). But Ik0 is C \u221e since it is the Fourier transform of a compactly supported\n2\ndistribution; just observe that on the ball of radius one, which is where k0 is supported, all tn e\u2212i\u03c0t k(t)\nare uniformly bounded.\nFor Ik\u221e we have:\nIk\u221e (x) =\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ne\u22122\u03c0ixt e\u2212i\u03c0t k(t)\u03b7\u221e (t)dt\n\nwhich is a convergent integral. The argument goes as follows:\n2\n\nWe have: e\u2212i\u03c0t =\n\ni d \u2212i\u03c0t2\n,\n2\u03c0t dt e\n\nso that\n\nIk\u221e (x) = c\n\nZ\n\n1 \u22122\u03c0ixt d \u2212i\u03c0t2\ne\n{ e\n}k(t)\u03b7\u221e (t)dt\nt\ndt\n\nIntegrating by parts we get a sum of four integrals, where the differentiation in t falls on each of the\nfour terms 1t , e\u22122\u03c0ixt , k(t), and \u03b7\u221e (t) respectively. If the t differentation falls on e\u22122\u03c0ixt , we get an\nintegral which is similar to the defining integral for Ik\u221e , but with a better decay. Repeating this\nprocess enough number of times, we will eventually get an absolutely convergent integral.\nIf the t-differentiation falls on k(t) or 1t , we get an absolutely convergent integral, and if it falls on \u03b7\u221e ,\nthe integral is the Fourier transform of a compactly supported distribution so it is a C \u221e function.\nDifferentiating with respect to x we have:\nZ\nZ\n2\nd\n\u22122\u03c0ixt \u2212i\u03c0t2\ne\nk(t)\u03b7\u221e (t)dt = c e\u22122\u03c0ixt e\u2212i\u03c0t k(t)\u03b7\u221e (t)dt\n\u2202x Ik\u221e (x) = c te\ndt\nand a carbon copy of the above argument gives the desired result on convergence of this integral.\nNow there only remains the study of the asymptotic behaviour of this integral.\nIn the integral representing Ik , separate the contribution of k0 and k\u221e :\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\ne\u22122\u03c0ixt e\u2212i\u03c0t k0 (t)dt +\ne\u22122\u03c0ixt e\u2212i\u03c0t k\u221e (t)dt\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f6\n\nHADI JOR\u00c1TI\n2\n\nThe first integral is the A(x) in the statement of the lemma. Expand the term e\u2212i\u03c0t in Taylor\nP\n2\n2n\nexpansion around zero: e\u2212i\u03c0t = \u221e\nand insert it in the integral. The desired expansion\nn=0 cn t\nfollows from the observation that\nZ\ne\u22122\u03c0ixt tn k0 (t)dt = cn \u2202xn k(x)\nThe second term is equal to\ne\u2212i\u03c0x\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nei\u03c0(x\u2212t) k\u221e (t)dt\n\nSo we just need to show that this new integral has the asymptotic expansion we suggested for B.\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n\u22122\u03c0ixt\ndt\n(2.2)\nB(x) = ei\u03c0(x\u2212t) k\u221e (t)dt = ei\u03c0t k\u221e (x \u2212 t)dt = c e\u2212i\u03c0t kc\n\u221e (t)e\n\nThe last equality is true by unitariness of the Fourier transform and the fact that the Fourier transform\n2\n2\n1\n\u22122\u03c0ixt\nof k\u221e (x \u2212 t), is kc\n; and the Fourier transform of e\u2212i\u03c0t is (i)\u2212 2 ei\u03c0x\n\u221e (t)e\nIn the last integral in equation 3.2, separate the contribution of zero and infinity, by bringing in the\ncut-off functions \u03b70 and \u03b7\u221e again:\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u22122\u03c0ixt\n\u2212i\u03c0t2 c\nk\u221e (t)e\ndt = e\u2212i\u03c0t e\u22122\u03c0ixt \u03b7\u221e (t)kc\ne\n\u221e (t)dt + I1 (x)\n\nwhere I1 is a similar integral where we have replaced \u03b7\u221e by \u03b70 .\n\nBut the first integral is rapidly decreasing since away from zero, you can integrate it by parts, as many\nnumber of times as desired, bringing down an order of decay in x with each integration. So we only\nneed to look at the integral I1 .\nZ\n2\nI1 (x) = e\u2212i\u03c0t e\u22122\u03c0ixt \u03b70 (t)kc\n\u221e (t)dt\n\nb\nBut as we observed in the observation above, near x = 0, the term kc\n\u221e (x) is the sum of k(x) and a\n\u221e\nC function \u03c6. The remaining integral\nZ\n2\ne\u2212i\u03c0t e\u22122\u03c0ixt \u03b70 (t)\u03c6(t)dt\n\nis easily seen to be of rapid decrease. The other integral is exactly the integral we had for A(x), just\nwith b\nk replacing k, so the same trick (Taylor expansion around zero) gives the similar result. Thus\nthe proof of the lemma is now complete. \u0003\nCorollary 2.4.

Proof of theorem 1.1\nIn the following we will give a proof of the theorem for the case c0 = 1. The proof for arbitary constant\nc0 is no different.\nFirst observe that, by corollary 2.4.4 of Nagel, Ricci, Stein [3]. for every flat kernel M , there is a\nuniformly bounded collection of compactly supported, C \u221e functions {\u03c6m,n }m,n\u2208Z,n\u22650 , whose supports\nare bounded uniformly and which satisfy the estimates for flag kernels uniformly, and each \u03c6m,n\nsatisfies the cancellation conditions:\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6m,n (x, y)dx = 0\n\u03c6m,n (x, y)dy = 0\n\nP\n(m,m+n)\nconverges to M in the sense of distributions. \u03c6(m,n) is a dyadic re-scaling\nsuch that m,n \u03c6m,n\nof \u03c6 defined as: \u03c6(m,n) (x, y) := 2\u2212m\u2212n \u03c6(2\u2212m x, 2\u2212n y)\ndyadic re-scaling\nThis gives a sequence {fi } of C0\u221e functions which converges, in the sense of distributions, to M , and\nwhich satisfy uniformly the estimates for flag kernels.\nAs a result, the C0\u221e functions f \u0303i (x, y) = Ki (x, y) := fi (y \u2212 cx2 ) converge in the sense of distributions\nto the curved kernel K, and satisfy uniformly the estimates for K. But we know that if a uniformly\nbounded sequence of distributions {fi } converges to a distribution F , then {fbi } converges to Fb in\nci converge in the sense of distributions to K\nb and\nthe sense of distributions. Thus the functions K\nc\nby what will be proved below (for Ki in the place of K) the functions Ki will then be uniformly\nb will be a bounded function. Our proof then proceeds with K standing for Ki , and\nbounded. Hence K\nM standing for fi .\nIf M\u03b7 is the Fourier transform in the second variable:\nZ\nM\u03b7 (x) := e\u22122\u03c0iy\u03b7 M (x, y)dy\n\nwe observe that\n(3.1)\n\nm(\u03be, \u03b7) =\n\nZ\n\ne\u22122\u03c0i(x\u03be+x\n\n2\n\n\u03b7)\n\nM\u03b7 (x)dx\n\nIt is easy to check that {M\u03b7 }\u03b7 is a uniformly bounded family of CZ kernels. Let us for example check\nthe cancellation condition and see if they are uniformly satisfied:\nZ\nZZ\nM\u03b7 (x)\u03c6(Rx)dx =\ne\u22122\u03c0iy\u03b7 M (x, y)\u03c6(Rx)dxdy\nR\nbut by definition the family M (x, y)\u03c6(Rx)dx is a uniformly bounded family of CZ kernels, so the\nbounds on their multipliers are uniform and we are done.\n\nWe sometimes wish to write our coordinates in polar form. Whenever we have a function, distribution,\netc, in \u03be, \u03b7 variables (e.g. M (\u03be, \u03b7)) we denote the same quantity in polar coordinates, by the same\nsymbol, with a \u03c0 subscript:\nM\u03c0 (a, \u03b4) := M (a\u03b4, \u03b4 2 ) = M (\u03be, \u03b7)\nSwitching to this system of polar coordinates, we are ready to finish the proof of thorem 1.1 which\nclaims that each of L1,\u03c0 and L2,\u03c0 brings down one order of decay in \u03b4 with each differentiation, and\none order of decay in a for large a ( a \u2192 \u221e).\n|\u2202\u03b4\u03b1 \u2202a\u03b2 Li,\u03c0 (a, \u03b4)| \u2264 C\u03b1,\u03b2 |\u03b4|\u2212\u03b1 (1 + a)\u2212\u03b2\nThis is equivalent to the claim that each order of differentiation in a of each of the uniformly bounded\nfamilies of CZ multipliers\n\u03b4 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b4\u03b1 L1,\u03c0 (a, \u03b4)\n\n\u03b4 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b4\u03b1 L2,\u03c0 (a, \u03b4)\n\nbrings down a decay of |a|\u22121 for a \u2192 \u221e. This last claim is the content of Corollary 2.4 on the asymptotic behaviour of a certain integral defined for a uniformly bounded family of Calderon-Zygmund\n\n\f8\n\nHADI JOR\u00c1TI\n\nkernels. So, now we only need to show that on the region where |\u03b7| > c|\u03be|2 > 0 the multiplier of the\ncurved kernel is a Mikhlin multiplier and that will end the proof.\nSo we know the behaviour of m(\u03be, \u03b7) on the region where |\u03be| \u2265 c|\u03b7|1/2 . There only remains the analysis\nof this Fourier transform in the region above the parabola: |\u03b7| > c|\u03be|2 > 0.\n\b\nLemma 3.1. For each \u03b1, the family \u03b7 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b7\u03b1 M\u03b7 (x) \u03b7 is a uniformly bounded family of CZ kernels.\n\nProof. If M (x, y) is a flag kernel with respect to flag F1 , then it is easy to check that the partial\nderivative of M with respect to the second variable y, is a new distribution M \u2032 which is itself a flag\nkernel, with respect to the same flag, i.e. for every M , there exists an M \u2032 such that y\u2202y M (x, y) =\nM \u2032 (x, y).

We need to study the behaviour of the integral representing m(\u03be, \u03b7) under differentiation\nwith respect to \u03be and \u03b7, and check whether they satisfy the decay properties needed. We do this,\nby checking separately the decay condition for the first derivatives with respect to \u03be and \u03b7, and the\nsimilar conclusion for higher derivatives will follow. Namely, we will check whether\n|\u2202\u03be m(\u03be, \u03b7)| \u2264 C(|\u03be| + |\u03b7|1/2 )\u22121\nWe have:\n\u2202\u03be m(\u03be, \u03b7) =\n\nZ\n\nand |\u2202\u03b7 m(\u03be, \u03b7)| \u2264 C(|\u03be| + |\u03b7|1/2 )\u22122\n\nxM\u03b7 (x)e\u2212i(x\u03be+x\n\n2\n\n\u03b7)\n\ndx\n\nBreak-up this integral into two parts: |x| < A|\u03b7|1/2 and |x| \u2265 A|\u03b7|1/2 .

The proof\nof Theorem 1.1 is now complete. \u0003\nUsing theorem 1.1, we can also deduce a boundedness result for the class of curved flag kernels under\nstudy. This was independently proved by Secco [5]. After our work was completed in 2004, we found\nout about the paper of Secco, which is a direct proof of this corollary.\nCorollary 3.3. If M is a flat flag kernel with respect to flag F1 , and K is the curved version, and\nm the Fourier transform of K, then m is an Lp multiplier for 1 < p < \u221e.\nProof. Introducing a smooth cut-off function, break up m into two parts.\nSuppose \u03a8(x) is a compactly supported C \u221e function which is identically equal to 1 on |x| \u2264 1, and\nzero on |x| > 2. Put:\n\u03b7\nm0 (\u03be, \u03b7) := m(\u03be, \u03b7)\u03a8( 2 )\nm1 := m \u2212 m0\n\u03be\nm0 being the restriction on the region under parabola of a fixed slope: |\u03be| \u2265 c|\u03b7|1/2 , and m1 restriction\non the region above the parabola: |\u03be| < c|\u03b7|1/2 . m1 is a Mikhlin multiplier and so an Lp multiplier,\nas can be seen from theorems of Fabes, Riviere, [2], and Folland, Stein. [?]. m0 is an Lp multiplier\nbecause it is the sum of a flat flag multiplier which we know is an Lp mutplier [3], and a second term\n\u2032 \u03be2\n\n1/2\n\nwhich is itself a product of two terms. m0 (\u03be, \u03b7) = L1 (\u03be, \u03b7) + eic \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03be L2 (\u03be, \u03b7) One term is again a\nflat flag mutiplier so we use the theorem of Nagel, Ricci, and Stein again. The other term is basically\nthe multiplier of ordinary Hilbert transform on the parabola, so it is bounded on Lp . \u0003\nBy analogy to the special case studied before, we can predict the asymptotic behaviour of L1 and L2 :\nwhen\n\n\u03be\n\u2192\u221e:\n\u03b7 1/2\n\nc(\u03be, \u03b7),\nL1 (\u03be, \u03b7) \u223c M\n\nL2 (\u03be, \u03b7) \u223c\n\n\u03be\n\u03be\nM\u03b7 ( )\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\nIn fact, using lemma 2.4 we can establish a more precise relation between L1 and L2 . This is the\ncontent of our remark in the first section. Howevere, we note that the relation can only be stated\nin terms of asymptotics of these multipliers, since the exact form of the multiplier depends on many\nfactors such as the specific cut off functions we use at different stages and hence out of control.\nc(\u03be, \u03b7) is also a flat flag multiplier, but with respect to the flag F2 instead. So\nNotice that the term M\non the region specified, it is highly regular: it is a Mikhlin multiplier with respect to the specified\n1/2\nnon-isotropic dilations. Also notice that \u03b7 \u03be L2 (\u03be, \u03b7) is a flag multiplier with respect to flag F1 on\n|\u03be| \u2265 c|\u03b7|1/2 .\nThe constant c\u2032 is related to the constant c0 in choosing the parabola that carries the singularity, by\nc0 c\u2032 = \u03c02 . This can be seen from the following heuristic argument. The Fourier transform of K is such\nan integral:\nZZ\n=\n\nZZ\n\ne\n\nb \u03b7) =\nK(\u03be,\n\ne\u22122\u03c0i(x\u03be+y\u03b7) M (x, y \u2212 c0 x2 )dxdy\n\n\u22122\u03c0i(x\u03be+c0 x2 \u03b7) \u22122\u03c0iy\u03b7\n\ne\n\nM (x, y)dxdy =\n\nfor {M\u03b7 } a uniformly bounded family of CZ kernels.\n\nZ\n\ne\u22122\u03c0i(x\u03be+c0 x\n\n2\n\n\u03b7)\n\nM\u03b7 (x)dx\n\n\f10\n\nHADI JOR\u00c1TI\n\n. We know\nThe main contribution in this last integral is from the stationary phase point at x0 = 2c\u2212\u03be\n0\u03b7\nR i\u03a6(x)\ni\u03a6(x0 )\nthat the main term in a stationary integral of the form e\n\u03a8(x)dx has a phase term e\nwhere\n2\n\nx0 is the stationary point. So for our integral the phase term is e\n\n\u2212\u03be\n\u22122\u03c0i 4c\n\u03b7\n0\n\n, which is the same as eic\n\n\u2032 \u03be2\n\u03b7\n\n.\n\n4. proof of theorem 1.2\nThe machinery we need has already been developed for the proof of theorem 1.1, and the proof of the\nreverse direction is basically a bootstrap argument. First we observe that\nLemma 4.1. If M is a flat flag kernel with respect to flag F2 , then for any constant c, the new kernel\ndefined as M (x, y \u2212 cx2 ) is also a flat flag kernel with respect to the same flag.\nThis is a rather trivial lemma, remembering the alternative description of the kernels and multipliers\nin parabolic polar coordinates. When you shift to parabolic polar coordinates, the change of variables\ndescribed in the satement of the lemma is the same as a \"shift\" in a (parabolic angle) so none of the\nconditions change.\nProof of theorem 1.2. Writing down the inverse Fourier transform of the given distribution, it will\nbe of the form:\n(4.1)\nZZ\n1/2\n1/2\n2\n\u2032 \u03be2 \u03b7\nic\u2032 \u03be\u03b7 \u03b7\nK(x, y) := InverseF.T.{\u03a6(\u03be, \u03b7)e\nl(\u03be, \u03b7)}(x, y) =\ne2\u03c0ix\u03be e2\u03c0iy\u03b7 \u03a6(\u03be, \u03b7)eic \u03b7\nl(\u03be, \u03b7)d\u03bed\u03b7\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\nWhich we have to show is in this form: M2 (x, y) + M1 (x, y \u2212 c0 x2 ) where M1 is a flat flag kernel\nwith respect to F1 and M2 is a flat flag kernel with respect to F2 and c0 the dual constant to c\u2032 . Or,\nequivalanatly, that K(x, y + c0 x2 ) is of the form M1 (x, y) + M2 (x, y + c0 x2 ) But according to lemma\n4.1 M2 (x, y + c0 x2 ) is just M \u2032 (x, y) for some other flat flag kernel M \u2032 with respect to the same flag,\nand to show that K(x, y + c0 x2 ) is in form M1 (x, y) + M \u2032 (x, y) where M1 and M \u2032 are flat flag kernels\nwith respect to F1 and F2 respectively, is the same as showing that it equals a product kernel.\nPerforming integration in (4.1) with respect to \u03be first, the distribution can be written as the following\ndouble integral:\nZ\nZ\n\u2032 \u03be2 1\n2\u03c0iy\u03b7 1/2\ne2\u03c0ix\u03be \u03a6(\u03be, \u03b7)eic \u03b7 l(\u03be, \u03b7)d\u03be}d\u03b7\n(4.2)\nK(x, y) = e\n\u03b7 {\n\u03be\n|\u03be|2 \u2265c|\u03b7|\nThe main contribution is from the stationary point of the phase at \u03be0 = cx\u03b7, so by absorbing the error\nin the \u03a6 term, replacing it with another cut off function \u03a6\u0303, satisfying the same decay estimates, the\nwhole expression reduces to\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nZ\n2\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u03a6\u0303(x, \u03b7)\nl(cx\u03b7, \u03b7)d\u03b7\ne2\u03c0iy\u03b7 \u03b7 1/2 eic0 x \u03b7\n\u2032 \u03b7 \u22121\n\u2212i2c\ncx\u03b7\n2\n|x \u03b7|\u2265c\nbut according to lemma 4.1, we only need to show that this expression equals a product kernel after\nthe change of variables y 7\u2192 y \u2212 c0 x2 . This is the content of next lemma:\nLemma 4.2.\nP (x, y) := K(x, y + c0 x2 ) =\n\nZ\n\n|x2 \u03b7|\u2265c\n\nis a product kernel in R2 .\n\n1\nce2\u03c0iy\u03b7 \u03a6\u0303(x, \u03b7) l(cx\u03b7, \u03b7)d\u03b7\nx\n\nWe prove the claim by taking the Fourier transform of this expression and show that it is a bounded\nfunction and has the decay properties of a product multiplier and that would conclude the proof.\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\ne\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7)dx\ne\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l(x\u03b7, \u03b7)\u03a6\u0303(x, \u03b7)dx =\nPb(\u03be, \u03b7) =\nx\nx\n2\n2\n|x \u03b7|\u2265c\n|x \u03b7|\u2265c\n\nfor another flat flag multiplier of the same kind l\u0303(\u03be, \u03b7). It is clear that away from the coordinate axes\n\u03b7 = 0 and \u03be = 0 this expression is a smooth function.\n\n\fON A CLASS OF CURVED FLAG MULTIPLIERS\n\n11\n\nBut l\u0303 is a flag multiplier and hence also a product multiplier, so\n\u2202\u03b7 l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7) = x\u22021 l(x\u03b7, \u03b7) + \u22022 l(x\u03b7, \u03b7) = x(x\u03b7)\u22121 l1 (x\u03b7, \u03b7) + \u03b7 \u22121 l2 (x\u03b7, \u03b7)\nfor l1 and l2 of the same type. So each differentiation in \u03b7 brings down one order of decay |\u03b7|\u22121 and\nleaves an integral of the same kind. So there only remains treatment of differentiation in \u03be.\nNotice that the integral is in form of the Fourier transform of a multiple of two functions, namely\n1\n2\nx (restricted to |x \u03b7| \u2265 c) and l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7). So, the integral will be the convolution of their Fourier\ntransforms. Also notice that the Fourier transform of the first function x1 is uniformly bounded, so\nwe only need to show that\nZ\n|\u2202\u03be\u03b1\ne\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7)dx| \u2264 C\u03b1 |\u03be|\u2212\u03b1\n|x2 \u03b7|\u2265c\n\nBreak up the integral into two parts:\nZ\n\n+\n\n|x\u03be|<1\n\nZ\n\n|x\u03be|\u22651\n\n!\n\ne\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7)dx\n\nFor the fist integral we want to show that\nZ\n|\nx\u03bee\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7)dx| \u2264 C\n|x\u03be|<1\n\nwhich is trivial since l\u0303 is bounded. For the second integral we want to show that\nZ\n|\n\u03bee\u22122\u03c0ix\u03be l\u0303(x\u03b7, \u03b7)dx| \u2264 C|x|\u22121\n|x\u03be|<1\n\nwhich is clear after an integration by parts. (This is basically a nonstationary phase estimate decay)\nHigher order derivatives are treated the same way. Thus the proof of theorem 1.2 is now complete. \u0003\nA remark about asymptotic behaviour of M1 and M2 is in order. The inverse Fourier transform maps\n\u2032 \u03be2\n\n\u03a6(\u03be, \u03b7)eic \u03b7 \u03b7 1/2 \u03be \u22121 l(\u03be, \u03b7) to M1 (x, y) + M2 (x, y \u2212 c0 x2 ). Taking the Fourier transform back again,\nwe should end up with the original function. Yet, using theorem 1.1 there is an alternative description\nfor this expression as a sum of three terms:\n\n\u03be2\n\u03b7\n\nc1 (\u03be, \u03b7) + L1 (\u03be, \u03b7) + \u03a8(\u03be, \u03b7)eic\u2032\nM\n\n\u03be2\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7 1/2 \u03be \u22121 l(\u03be, \u03b7)\n\nc1 (\u03be, \u03b7) \u223c L1 (\u03be, \u03b7). But\n\u2192 0, \u03a8 and \u03a6 are identically equal to 1 and hence M\nd\nby the remark from theorem 1.1 we know that L1 (\u03be, \u03b7) \u223c M\n2 (\u03be, \u03b7) which concludes the remark on\ntheorem 1.2.\n\nIn the limit where\n\nAacknowledgements\nThe major part of this work is from the author's dissertation written under the guidance of Professor\nElias Stein, whom we gratefully thank for many helpful discussions as well as invaluable insight.
