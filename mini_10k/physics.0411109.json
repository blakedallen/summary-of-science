Previous assertions to the contrary have led to unnecessarily complicated\ninterpretations of experiments which indicate that single photons do travel with faster-than-c\nspeeds in regions of anomalous dispersion.\n\n\f3\nI.\n\nIntroduction\nShortly after the publication of Einstein's original paper on special relativity in 1905\n\n[1], it was pointed out by Wien [2] that a possible contradiction to the new theory might occur\nfor light passing through a region of anomalous dispersion. Since the refractive index n can\nbe less than unity under these conditions, it was argued that both the phase and group\nvelocities of light can be greater than c, the speed of light in free space. Continuing to the\npresent day, it has been widely assumed that special relativity precludes the possibility of\nfaster-than-c speeds, so in 1907 detailed arguments were presented by Sommerfeld [3] to\nshow that the above experimental phenomenon can be reconciled with this theory as long as\nthe corresponding signal and energy velocities do not exceed v = c. In the last decade new\nexperimental evidence has been presented [4,5] which shows quite clearly that single photons\ndo propagate with v > c speeds in the neighborhood of absorption lines, but there has been a\ngeneral reluctance to accept this result at face value [4,6], again because it is thought to be\ninconsistent with special relativity.\nIt is important to note that one of the objections to faster-than-c speeds is not applicable\nto the case of anomalous dispersion of light, and is in fact the only one actually mentioned by\nEinstein in his original work [1].\n\nHe pointed out that particles with non-zero proper mass\n\nwould experience a singularity in their kinetic energy when accelerated to v = c and thus ruled\nout speeds at or above this value for any such entity, but by the same argument that this\nrestriction does not apply to photons by virtue of their vanishing proper mass.\n\nThere is\n\nanother objection, however, namely the assertion that Einstein causality must be violated\naccording to special relativity whenever v > c because of a consequence of the Lorentz\ntransformation [7].\n\nThis second difficulty is potentially relevant for photons and implies that\n\n\f4\nthe time order of two events can be opposite for two observers moving with different relative\nspeeds, something which is justifiably considered to be strictly unphysical and thus to stand in\ncontradiction to special relativity.\n\nII.\n\nPhase Relationships and Einstein Causality\nIn view of the lingering uncertainties in the interpretation of the recent experiments dealing\n\nwith the anomalous dispersion phenomenon, it is well to reexamine the latter objection to\nfaster-than-c speeds.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation equation for space and time intervals \u2206x\n\nand \u2206t are given below for two observers moving at relative speed u in the x direction:\n\n\u2206x'(u) = \u03b5 x(u) \u03b3(u) (\u2206x - u \u2206t)\nu\n\u2206t'(u) = \u03b5 t(u) \u03b3(u) (\u2206t\u2206x),\nc2\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 -\n\nu\n\n2\n\nc2\n\n(1)\n\n)-1/2. The quantities \u03b5 x and \u03b5 t must be chosen to be consistent with the\n\nrelativistic invariance condition for the two observers in their respective (primed and\numprimed) inertial systems, namely\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2206x ' ( u ) - c2 \u2206t ' ( u) = \u2206x - c2 \u2206t ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhereby the corresponding spatial intervals in the transverse directions for the two observers\nare taken to be equal in arriving at the above expression.\n\nThis requirement leads to the\n\nconditions, \u03b5 x2 = \u03b5 t2 = 1, and thus to an ambiguity in the respective signs of these two\nquantities.\n\nThis uncertainty is normally removed by noting that the above equations must\n\n\f5\nreduce to the Galilean transformation for small relative speed u. Consequently, both \u03b5 x and \u03b5 t\nare assigned a value of +1, and by virtue of the physical requirement of continuous variation\nin both \u2206x'(u) and \u2206t'(u), it is argued that this result must hold quite generally for all\naccessible relative speeds u < c.\nIn the case of present interest the speed v of photons in a dispersive medium with a group\nindex of refraction ng is defined as\n\nv=\n\n\u2206x\nc\n=\n.\n\u2206t\nng\n\n(3)\n\nSubstitution in eq. (1) gives\n\n\u2206x' = \u03b5 x(u) \u03b3(u) \u2206x (1= \u03b5 x(u) \u03b3(u) \u2206x (1\u2206t' = \u03b5 t(u) \u03b3 (u) \u2206t (1-\n\nu\n)\nv\nng u\n\nc\nuv\n\n)\n\n(4)\n\n)\nc2\nu\n= \u03b5 t(u) \u03b3(u) \u2206t (1 ),\nng c\n\nwhere again \u03b5 x and \u03b5 t are shown explicitly as in eq. (1). The conventional Einstein causality\nargument [7] then goes as follows. If ng < 1, the quantity in parentheses in the expression for\n\u2206 t' can be negative for c > u > ng c. By assuming as above that \u03b5 t = 1, it is concluded that in\nthis range of u, \u2206t' must have the opposite sign as \u2206t, a clear violation of Einstein causality.\nThe latter argument overlooks an important point, however. Since \u2206t' vanishes in eq. (4)\nfor u = ng c, it is no longer required on continuity grounds that \u03b5 t = +1 for this value of u. All\n\n\f6\nthat is required physically is that \u2206 t' itself be a continuous function of u, and this objective\ncan be accomplished with either choice of sign for \u03b5 t(u) at the critical speed u = ng c.\nIn Fig. 1 both \u2206x' and c \u2206t' are given as a function of \u03b2 =\n\nu\nfor a dispersive medium with\nc\n\nng = 0.5. In this diagram \u03b5 x(u) always has a value of +1 but \u03b5 t(u) changes discontinuously\nfrom +1 to -1 at \u03b2 = 0.5 (the light source moves in the opposite direction as the light itself\nfrom the vantage point of the observer).\n\nThe relativistic invariance condition of eq. (2) is\n\neverywhere satisfied and a violation of Einstein causality does not occur, i.e. \u2206t' is never\nopposite in sign to \u2206t. Most importantly, both \u2206x' and \u2206t' are continuous functions of u with\nthe above choices for \u03b5 x(u) and \u03b5 t(u), so that all physical constraints are satisfied.\nOne other consequence of the discontinuity in \u03b5 t at \u03b2 = ng is that the derivative d\u2206t'/d\u03b2 is\nnot defined at this relative speed, but there is no compelling argument against this result. The\nobserver simply measures a monotonically decreasing time interval as \u03b2 is gradually\nincreased up to the critical value of ng , at which point \u2206t' vanishes (Fig. 1). As \u03b2 is further\nincreased, the measured time interval begins to increase monotonically, always with the same\nsign as \u2206t. The spatial interval \u2206x' also reaches a minimum value at \u03b2 = ng and retains the\nsame sign over the entire range of accessible relative speeds.\nThere remains one other conceivable objection to faster-than-c speeds, namely the fact that\nthe measured velocity v' =\n\n\u2206 x'\nhas a singularity at \u03b2 = ng by virtue of the vanishing of \u2206t' at\n\u2206t '\n\nthis relative speed (see Fig. 1). It is only a point singularity, however, which means that the\nobserver would have to be moving at exactly the critical relative speed \u03b2 = ng to measure\nother than finite values for v' according to the present theory. It is important to recall that the\narguments under discussion only apply to photons moving through an anomalously dispersive\nmedium. This implies that the range over which unlimited speeds can be observed is quite\n\n\f7\nrestricted, since it is a practical impossibility to construct such a medium with a uniform\ngroup index of refraction which extends over more than a short distance.\nThe latter considerations are significant in another context, however.\n\nThere has been\n\nspeculation [8] that particles with imaginary proper masses (tachyons) might exist which\nwould necessarily travel with faster-than-c speeds through free space. If such a particle were\nobserved, special relativity again demands that there be a critical relative speed u (\n\nc2\n) for\nv\n\nwhich \u2206t' vanishes and thus the measured speed of the tachyon would be infinite in the\ncorresponding inertial system. Since the particle could attain this speed in free space, there is\nnothing in special relativity to prevent its being observed simultaneously in parts of the\nuniverse which are many light years apart. Although one can't fully rule out such a prospect,\nit is far less difficult to imagine that an observer moving at close to the speed of light relative\nto a laser source would measure a null value for the elapsed time taken by a single photon to\ncover a distance of only a few \u03bcm [4,5]. It also should be noted that the same argument that\nhas been used above for space-time intervals can also be applied to energy-momentum fourvectors.\n\nHence, by proper choice of the sign employed in the corresponding Lorentz\n\ntransformation it is also possible to avoid the conclusion [8] that negative-energy states are\nthe inevitable consequence of faster-than-c tachyon speeds.\nWith the above choice of signs for the Lorentz transformation it is seen that the velocity of\nthe faster-than-c photon is in the same direction for all observers regardless of their relative\nspeed u. This result is thus in sharp contrast to what is obtained when \u2206t' is allowed to change\nsign as the critical speed u = ng c is surpassed, in which case\n\n\u2206 x'\nchanges abruptly from + \u221e\n\u2206t '\n\nto - \u221e at this point. Since the relative speed of the observer is always less than the photon's\nspeed c/ng for ng < 1 it must be expected that the perceived direction of the motion will\n\n\f8\nalways be the same, so the situation depicted in Fig. 1 is by far the more intuitively reasonable\nof the two possibilities. The fact that the photon's speed is observed to increase with \u03b2 up to\nthe critical value of ng , that is, as the observer moves more quickly away from the light\nsource, is tied up with the fact that, although \u2206 x' and \u2206 t' are both decreasing with \u03b2 in this\nrange (Fig. 1), the latter is decreasing faster on a fractional basis, ultimately reaching a null\nvalue at \u03b2 = ng . For slower-than-c speeds it is \u2206 x' that is decreasing faster and hence the\nmeasured speed of the object decreases with \u03b2 over the entire range of accessible relative\nspeeds. In this case the key velocity is u = v = \u2206 x/\u2206 t [see eq. (1)], for which \u2206x' vanishes\nand the object appears to reverse direction as the relative speed of the observer is further\nincreased.\n\nIII.\n\nRelation to Experiment\n\nOnce it is realized that by appropriate choice of signs in the Lorentz transformation it is\npossible to avoid a violation of Einstein causality in the theoretical description of faster-than-c\nspeeds, it is no longer necessary to look for other than a straightforward interpretation of the\nexperimental results obtained in regions of anomalous dispersion [4,5].\n\nIn other words, the\n\nindividual photons observed in these experiments really do travel with v > c. At least there is\nno evidence to the contrary, either theoretical or experimental.\n\nEach photon is a separate\n\nentity with a definite speed. Many of them are absorbed in such experiments [4,6] and thus\ndo not reach the detector, but there is every reason to believe that those that are transmitted\nare moving at the speed actually measured for them. This conclusion is also consistent with\nrecent measurements of photon velocity distributions in dispersive media vis-a-vis those in air\n[9].\n\nTime-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) detection indicates that the \u03b4-function\n\n\f9\ncharacter of the velocity distribution of photons emanating from a laser source is left\nunchanged as the light passes from air through water, and hence that the speed of each photon\nis determined solely by the value of the group refractive index ng in any given medium.\nCarrying this result over to the case of media with ng < 1 simply leads one to expect what has\nbeen observed experimentally, namely that each transmitted photon is actually moving with\nv > c.\n\nIV. Energy and Signal velocity\nAs a final remark, it is important to consider the arguments given by Sommerfeld and\nBrillouin [2,10,11] regarding the definitions of energy and signal velocity and their relation to\nthe more conventional terms, phase and group velocity. Their conclusion was that the way to\nreconcile special relativity with the fact that the group velocity of light exceeds c in regions of\nanomalous dispersion (ng < 1) is to realize that the wave front and the signal associated with\nthe wave motion propagate at different speeds which can never exceed c. This position needs\nto be reassessed in light of the present finding that purely mathematical considerations\neliminate the apparent\n\ninconsistency between special relativity and such experimental results.\n\nSince Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect [12], it has been recognized that the energy\nof light waves is carried by individual photons. On an elemental level, therefore, the energy\nvelocity must be identical with that of the photon itself. Moreover, a single photon can be a\nsignal, opening doors or sending an alarm, for example, so again in this sense, the photon\nvelocity and the signal velocity cannot be distinguished from one another. It might be argued\nthat a photon with an energy close to that of an absorption line is not a reliable signal because\nof the high probability of its being absorbed prior to reaching a suitable detector, but simply\n\n\f10\nincreasing the intensity of the laser beam makes it possible to effectively eliminate any time\ndelay that would result because the earliest photons were not transmitted.\n\nV. Conclusion\nIn summary, the main advantage of making the choice of signs advocated in the present\nwork for the Lorentz transformation for particles moving with v > c is that it allows one to\ninterpret all relevant\n\nexperimental results in a simple and straightforward manner without\n\nviolating Einstein causality and without making any change in the postulatory structure of the\ntheory of special relativity.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the\nSchwerpunkt Programm Theorie relativistischer Effekte in der Chemie und Physik schwerer\nElemente.\n\nThe financial support of the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie is also hereby\n\ngratefully acknowledged.\n\n\f11\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nA.

Their ratio\n(measured velocity) is also shown. Note that \u2206 t' is always positive in this diagram by\nvirtue of the choice of sign \u03b5 t (u) in the corresponding Lorentz transformation of eq.
