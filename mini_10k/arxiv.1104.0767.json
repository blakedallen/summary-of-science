This note is devotes to some remarks regarding the\nuse of variational methods, of minimax type, to establish continuity\ntype results.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe aim of this note is to present some situations where continuity\ntype results can be obtained through the use of minimax type arguments.\nTo give an idea of the type of results we obtain let us first consider\nthe equation\n(1.1)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u + \u03bbu = V (x)g(u),\n\nu \u2208 H 1 (RN ).\n\nHere \u03bb > 0, V is radially symmetric and g is assumed to be a nonlinear\nterm, superlinear at the origin and subcritical under which (1.1) has a\nnon trivial positive solution. Then assuming that, for any fixed \u03bb > 0\nequation (1.1) has at most one positive solution we prove that the map\n\u03bb \u2192 u\u03bb \u2208 H 1 (RN ) is continuous. Namely we establish the existence of\na global branch of solutions.\nAs a second example consider the equation\n(1.2)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u = |u|p\u22121u + f (x),\n\nu \u2208 H01 (\u03a9)\n\nN +2\nwhere \u03a9 \u2282 RN is an open regular bounded domain, 1 < p < N\nand\n\u22122\nN\nq\nf \u2208 L (\u03a9) for some q > 2 . We show that there exists a \u03b1 > 0 such that\nif ||f ||q \u2264 \u03b1 then (1.2) admits a positive solution on \u03a9. When ||f ||q\nis small enough it is standard to show that there exists a solution. If\nf \u2265 0, using the maximum principle, it follows that it is positive. Here\nwe prove, without assumption on the sign of f , but possibly decreasing\nthe value of ||f ||q , that this is still true.\n\nKey words and phrases. continuation properties, elliptic problem, minimax\nmethods.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\nThe note is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some abstract considerations. In Section 3 we apply them to a problem of the\ntype of (1.1). Section 4 deals with the nonhomogeneous problem (1.2).\n2. Some abstract considerations\nLet X be a reflexive Banach space whose norm is denoted || * ||.\nConsider for some \u03b5 > 0 and \u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[ a familly (I\u03bb ) of C 1\nfunctionals on X of the form\nI\u03bb (u) = A(u) \u2212 \u03bbB(u),\n\n\u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[.\n\nWe assume that\n(A1) Both B \u2208 C 1 (X, R) and its derivative B \u2032 \u2208 C(X, R) take\nbounded sets to bounded sets.\n(A2) For any \u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[\\{1} I\u03bb has a critical point u\u03bb at a level\ndenoted c\u03bb . Moreover there exists a bounded interval S \u2282 R\nsuch that c\u03bb \u2208 S if \u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[\\{1}.\n(A3) For any sequence (\u03bbn ) \u2282]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[\\{1} with \u03bbn \u2192 1 the\nsequence (u\u03bbn ) \u2282 X is bounded.\n(A4) Any bounded Palais-Smale sequence (vn ) for I := I1 such that\n(I(vn )) \u2282 S admits a converging subsequence.\nUnder these assumptions we have :\nTheorem 2.1. Assume that (A1)-(A4) hold. Then\n(i) There exists a critical point u of I such that I(u) \u2208 S.\n(ii) Any sequence (u\u03bbn ) with \u03bbn \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[\\{1} and \u03bbn \u2192 1\nconverges, up to a subsequence, toward a critical point of I,\nassociated to a level in S.\nProof. First we prove (i). Let (\u03bbn ) \u2282]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[\\{1} satisfies \u03bbn \u2192 1.\nBy (A3) the sequence (un ) := (u\u03bbn ) is bounded. Now we have\nI(un ) = I\u03bbn (un ) + (\u03bbn \u2212 1)B(un )\nI \u2032 (un ) = I\u03bb\u2032 n (un ) + (\u03bbn \u2212 1)B \u2032 (un ).\nBy (A1) it follows that\n(\u03bbn \u2212 1)B(un ) \u2192 0\n\nand\n\n(\u03bbn \u2212 1)B \u2032 (un ) \u2192 0.\n\nThus\nI(un ) = c\u03bbn + o(1)\n\nand\n\nI \u2032 (un ) = o(1).\n\n\fSOME CONTINUATION PROPERTIES VIA MINIMAX METHODS\n\n3\n\nSince, by (A2), the sequence (c\u03bbn ) \u2282 S is bounded, it follows that\n(u\u03bbn ) is a (bounded) Palais-Smale sequence for I. By (A4) we then\nknow that, passing to a subsequence, un \u2192 u with u \u2208 X a critical\npoint of I associated to a value in S. This proves (i). Now (ii) follows\nfrom the proof of (i).\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.2. Assume that (A1)-(A4) hold and that for \u03bb = 1 there\nexists at most a critical point u \u2208 X corresponding to a value in S.\nThen as \u03bb \u2192 1 we have u\u03bb \u2192 u. In particular c\u03bb \u2192 c, where c = I(u).\nProof. If we assume by contradiction that u\u03bb do not converge toward u\nif \u03bb \u2192 1 then on one hand there exists a sequence (\u03bbn ) \u2282]1\u2212\u03b5, 1+\u03b5[\\{1}\nwith \u03bbn \u2192 1 and a \u03b4 > 0 such that ||u\u03bbn \u2212 u|| \u2265 \u03b4 > 0. On the other\nhand repeating the proof of Theorem 2.1 on the sequence (u\u03bbn ) we\narrive at the conclusion that, up to a subsequence, u\u03bbn \u2192 u. This is a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.3. Using the results of [8] it can be shown, under very\ngeneral assumptions on the family I\u03bb , that for almost any \u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212\n\u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[, I\u03bb admit a bounded Palais-Smale sequence whose value stays\nwithin a compact. So if for any \u03bb \u2208]1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5[ any bounded PalaisSmale sequence for I\u03bb admit a converging subsequence we see that\nassumption (A2) holds.\n3. Problems on RN\n3.1. Autonomous cases. We consider the equation\n(3.1)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u + \u03bbu = g(u),\n\nu \u2208 H 1 (RN ),\n\nN \u22653\n\nwhere we assume that g \u2208 C(R, R) satisfies\n(H1) g(s)/s \u2192 0 as s \u2192 0.\n+2\n(H2) For some p \u2208]1, N\n[\nN \u22122\n\ng(s)/|s|p \u2192 0 as s \u2192 \u221e.\n(H3) There exists s0 > 0 such that G(s0 ) > 0 with G(s) :=\n\nRs\n0\n\ng(t)dt.\n\nThe natural functional associated to (3.1) is defined on H := H 1 (RN )\nby\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n2\n|\u2207u| + \u03bb|u| dx \u2212\nG(u) dx.\nI\u03bb (u) =\n2 RN\nRN\n\n\f4\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\nIt is standard that under (H1)-(H2) I\u03bb is well defined and of class C 1 .\nWe define the least energy level\n(3.2)\n\nm\u03bb = inf {I\u03bb (u), u \u2208 H\\{0}, I\u03bb\u2032 (u) = 0}\n\nand the set of least energy solution\nG\u03bb = {u \u2208 H\\{0}, I\u03bb\u2032 (u) = 0, I\u03bb (u) = m\u03bb }.\nAlso let \u03bb\u2217 = sup{\u03bb > 0 : \u2203\u03bd > 0 such that G(\u03bd) \u2212 \u03bb/2\u03bd 2 > 0}.\nFrom [3] it is known that, under (H1)-(H3) and for any 0 < \u03bb < \u03bb\u2217 ,\nm\u03bb > 0 and G\u03bb 6= \u2205 contains a positive element. In addition it is shown\nin [9] that m\u03bb admits a mountain pass characterization. Namely that\n(3.3)\n\nm\u03bb := inf max I\u03bb (g(t))\ng\u2208\u0393\u03bb t\u2208[0,1]\n\nwhere\n\u0393\u03bb := {g \u2208 C([0, 1], H), g(0) = 0, I\u03bb (g(1)) < 0}.\nThis characterization implies that \u03bb \u2192 m\u03bb is nondecreasing. Lastly we\nknown from [4] that any element of G\u03bb is radially symmetric and have\na given sign. We prove the following result.\nTheorem 3.1. Assume that (H1)-(H3) hold. Let \u03bb0 \u2208]0, \u03bb\u2217 [ and\n{(\u03bbn , un )} \u2282]0, \u03bb\u2217 [\u00d7H be a sequence such that\nun \u2208 G\u03bbn and \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThen there exist a u0 \u2208 G\u03bb0 and a subsequence (unk ) of (un ) such that\nunk \u2192 u0 as k \u2192 \u221e.\nIn particular \u03bb \u2192 m\u03bb is continuous.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.1 will follow from three lemmas. Since\nany G\u03bb only contains radially symmetric functions we can, without\nrestriction, work in the subspace\nHr1 (RN ) := {u \u2208 H 1 (RN ), u(x) = u(|x|)}.\nWe also recall that any critical point of I\u03bb in Hr1 (RN ) is, by the principle\nof symmetric criticality of Palais, also a critical point on all H 1 (RN ).\nWe set Hr := Hr1 (RN ).\nLemma 3.2. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1 the sequence\n(un ) \u2282 Hr is bounded.\n\n\fSOME CONTINUATION PROPERTIES VIA MINIMAX METHODS\n\n5\n\nProof. Since un , n \u2208 N is a critical point of I\u03bbn we know from [3] that\nit satisfies the Pohozaev identity\nZ\nh \u03bb\ni\nn\n2\n2\n(N \u2212 2)||\u2207un||2 = 2N \u2212 ||un ||2 +\nG(un )dx\n2\nRN\nand thus we have\n1\n(3.4)\nI\u03bbn (un ) = ||\u2207un ||22 .\nN\nBy the mountain pass characterization (3.3) the function \u03bb \u2192 m\u03bb is\nnon decreasing and since I\u03bbn (un ) = m\u03bbn we deduce from (3.4) that\n(||\u2207un||22 ) \u2282 R is bounded. Now since I\u03bb\u2032 n (un )un = 0 we have\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\n(3.5)\n|\u2207un | + \u03bbn |un | dx =\ng(un )un dx.\nRN\n\nRN\n\nBy (H1)-(H2) for any \u03b4 > 0 there exists C\u03b4 > 0 such that\nN+2\n\n|g(s)| \u2264 \u03b4|s| + C\u03b4 |s| N\u22122\n\nfor all s \u2208 R.\n\nThus using the Sobolev embeddings, it follows from (3.5) that, for a\nC > 0,\nZ\nZ\n2N\n2\n\u03bbn\n|un | dx \u2264 \u03b4\n|un |2 dx + C\u03b4 C||\u2207un ||2N\u22122 .\nRN\n\nRN\n\nSince \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb0 > 0, choosing \u03b4 > 0 sufficiently small and using the\nfact that (||\u2207un ||2 ) \u2282 R is bounded we see that (||un ||2 ) \u2282 R is also\nbounded.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1 any bounded\nPalais-Smale sequence for I\u03bb0 admits a converging subsequence.\nProof. Let (un ) \u2282 Hr be a bounded Palais-Smale sequence for I\u03bb0 .\nSince (un ) \u2282 Hr is bounded we have that un \u21c0 u in H and un \u2192 u\nin Lp (RN ) for p \u2208]2, N2N\n[ (see [15]). Now since (un ) \u2282 Hr is a Palais\u22122\nSmale sequence we have, in the dual Hr\u22121 ,\n\u2212\u2206un + \u03bbn un \u2212 g(un ) \u2192 0.\nUsing the strong convergence of (un ) we readily deduce from (H1)-(H2)\nthat g(un ) \u2192 g(u) in Hr\u22121. Thus\n(3.6)\n\n\u2212 \u2206un + \u03bbun \u2192 g(u) in Hr\u22121 .\n\nNow let L : Hr \u2192 Hr\u22121 be defined by\nZ\n(Lu)v =\n\u2207u\u2207v + \u03bbuv dx.\n\u03a9\n\n\f6\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\nThis operator is invertible and so we deduce from (3.6) that\nun \u2192 L\u22121 (G(u)) in Hr .\nConsequently by the uniqueness of the limit un \u2192 u in Hr .\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.4. The sequence (un ) \u2282 Hr is a, bounded, Palais-Smale\nsequence for I\u03bb0 at the level m\u03bb0 .\nProof. We already know that the sequence (m\u03bbn ) \u2282 R is bounded. Now\nwe have\nI\u03bb0 (un ) = I\u03bbn (un ) + (\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bb0 )||un||22\nI\u03bb\u2032 0 (un ) = I\u03bb\u2032 n (un ) + (\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bb0 )un .\nThus, since I\u03bb\u2032 n (un ) = 0 and (un ) \u2282 Hr is bounded we have I\u03bb\u2032 0 (un ) \u2192\n0. Also (\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bb0 )||un ||22 \u2192 0 and we deduce that (I\u03bb0 (un )) \u2282 R is\nbounded. This proves that (un ) \u2282 Hr is a bounded Palais-Smale\nsequence for I\u03bb0 . From Lemma 3.3 we deduce that un \u2192 u0 with\nu0 \u2208 Hr a critical point of I\u03bb0 . To conclude we just need to prove that\nm\u03bbn \u2192 m\u03bb0 . But, by the convergence un \u2192 u0 , we have that\n(3.7)\n\nlim m\u03bbn = lim I\u03bbn (un ) = I\u03bb0 (u0 ) \u2265 m\u03bb0 .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nNow considering a sequence (\u03bbn ) increasing to \u03bb0 , and using the fact\nthat \u03bb \u2192 m\u03bb is non decreasing, we deduce from (3.7) that m\u03bbn \u2192\nm\u03bb0 .\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Gathering Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 we immediately conclude.\n\u0003\nFrom Theorem 3.1 we deduce\nCorollary 3.5. Assume that (H1)-(H3) hold and that, for any \u03bb \u2208\n]0, \u03bb\u2217 [ the set G\u03bb contains only one positive element u\u03bb . Then the map\n\u03bb \u2192 u\u03bb is continuous from ]0, \u03bb\u2217 [ to Hr .\nProof. Let \u03bb0 > 0 be fixed and assume, by contradiction, that there\nexist a sequence (\u03bbn ) \u2282]0, \u03bb\u2217 [ with \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb0 and a \u03b4 > 0 such that\n||u\u03bbn \u2212 u\u03bb0 || \u2265 \u03b4. Then we deduce from Theorem 3.1 that u\u03bbn \u2192 u0 \u2208\nG\u03bb0 . Since the nonnegative property is preserved by the convergence\nusing the maximum principle we obtain that u0 is positive and thus by\nuniqueness u0 = u\u03bb0 .\n\u0003\n\n\fSOME CONTINUATION PROPERTIES VIA MINIMAX METHODS\n\n7\n\nRemark 3.6. The problem of deriving conditions on g which insure\nthat (3.1) has a unique positive solution (and thus an unique positive\nground state) has been extensively studied. The uniqueness is known\nto hold for a large class of nonlinearities. See for example [11] and the\nreferences therein in that direction.\nRemark 3.7. A result essentially the same as Corollary 3.5 was previously obtained in [14] (see also [13]). Let us also point out that another\nproof of Theorem 3.1 follows from Proposition 5.5 of [10]. The proofs\nthat we give here, are different and we believe somehow simpler.\n3.2. Non-autonomous cases. We consider now the equation\n(3.8)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u + \u03bbu = V (x)g(u),\n\nu \u2208 H 1 (RN )\n\nwhere we assume that g \u2208 C(R, R) satisfies in addition to (H1)-(H2)\n(H4) There exists \u03bc > 2 such that\n0 < \u03bcG(s) \u2264 g(s)s,\n\n\u2200s \u2208 R with G(s) :=\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ng(t)dt.\n\n0\n\nOn the potential V \u2208 C(RN , R) we assume\n(V) V \u2265 0, V 6= 0 and either V is radial or lim|x|\u2192\u221e V (x) = 0.\nUnder (H1),(H2),(H4) and (V) it is standard to show that (3.8) admit, for any \u03bb > 0, a non trivial solution as a critical point of the C 1\nfunctional\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n2\nI\u03bb (u) =\n|\u2207u| + \u03bb|u| dx \u2212\nV (x)G(u) dx.\n2 RN\nRN\nIndeed, one just need to use the mountain pass theorem (see [2]). The\nboundedness of Palais-Smale sequence follows from (H4) and because\nof (V) any bounded Palais-Smale sequence admits a converging subsequence. Thus one obtain a critical point at the mountain pass level\nthat we denote c\u03bb > 0. We now assume\n(U) For any \u03bb > 0, (3.8) admits at most one positive solution that\nwe denote u\u03bb \u2208 H 1 (RN ).\nWithout restriction (by a suitable modification of g for s < 0) we\ncan assume that the mountain pass solution is positive and thus that\nit coincide with u\u03bb .\nOur result is the following\n\n\f8\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\nTheorem 3.8. Assume that (H1),(H2),(H4) and (V), (U) hold. Then\nthe map \u03bb \u2192 u\u03bb from ]0, +\u221e[ to H 1 (RN ) is continuous.\nProof. The proof follows closely the one of Theorem 3.1 in the autonomous case. Our working space H is H 1 (RN ) if lim|x|\u2192\u221e V (x) = 0\nand Hr1 (RN ) if V is radial. We assume, by contradiction, that there\nexists a \u03bb0 > 0, a sequence (\u03bbn ) \u2282]0, +\u221e[ with \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb0 and a \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that ||u\u03bbn \u2212 u\u03bb0 || \u2265 \u03b4. First we show that the sequence (un ) \u2282 H\nis bounded. We have\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n2\n|\u2207u| + \u03bb|u| dx \u2212\nV (x)G(u) dx = c\u03bb .\nI\u03bb (u) =\n2 RN\nRN\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n2\n2\nI\u03bb (u)u =\n|\u2207u| + \u03bb|u| dx \u2212\nV (x)g(u)u dx = 0.\nRN\n\nRN\n\nThus, using (H4),\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n2\n|\u2207u| + \u03bb|u| dx = c\u03bb +\nV (x)G(u) dx\n2 RN\nRN\nZ\n1\n\u2264 c\u03bb +\nV (x)g(u)u dx\n\u03bc RN\nZ\n1\n|\u2207u|2 + \u03bb|u|2 dx.\n\u2264 c\u03bb +\n\u03bc RN\nHence\n\n\u0013Z\n1 1\n|\u2207u|2 + \u03bb|u|2dx \u2264 c\u03bb\n\u2212\n2 \u03bc\nRN\nand (un ) \u2282 H is indeed bounded. Now reasoning as in Lemma 3.4\nwe deduce that the sequence (un ) \u2282 H is a, bounded, Palais-Smale\nsequence for I\u03bb0 . Finally, following the proof of Lemma 3.3 we can\nshow that any bounded Palais-Smale sequence for I\u03bb0 admit a converging subsequence. At this point, using the uniqueness, we deduce that\n\u0003\nu\u03bbn \u2192 u\u03bb0 and this contradiction concludes the proof.\n\u0012\n\nRemark 3.9. The key feature that guarantee that the results presented in this Section hold is the fact that the mountain pass level\ncoincides with the least energy level. In Theorem 3.1 it follows from\nthe result of [9] and in Theorem 3.8 by the uniqueness of positive solutions.\nRemark 3.10. In [6], see Proposition 1, the analog of Theorem 3.1\nN +2\n[.\nis establish for (3.8) in the case where g(u) = |u|p\u22121u for p \u2208]1, N\n\u22122\nIn addition when the uniqueness of u\u03bb is assumed Theorem 3.8 holds\n\n\fSOME CONTINUATION PROPERTIES VIA MINIMAX METHODS\n\n9\n\ntrue. The proofs given in [6] use strongly the existence of a well defined Nehari manifold for I\u03bb . Using this manifold is possible when the\nfunction s \u2192 g(s)/s is stricly increasing. Under this condition it is\nnow standard, see for example Lemma 1.2 in [5] or Proposition 3.11\nin [12], that the mountain pass level c\u03bb coincides with the least energy\nlevel. Thus we can recover and extend to the results of [6] using the\napproach developped in Theorem 3.1.\nRemark 3.11. In equation (3.1) we have restricted ourselves to N \u2265\n3. The case N = 2 can also be treated under the assumption that\np \u2208]1, +\u221e[. Some additional work however is necessary at the level of\nLemma 3.2 to show the boundedness of the sequence (un ) \u2282 H. See\n[10] in that direction.\nRemark 3.12. The only purpose of condition (H4) is to insure the\nboundedness of Palais-Smale sequence for I\u03bb (or of sequences of critical\npoints of I\u03bbn ). Alternative conditions are possible.\n4. On a non-homogeneous problem\nWe consider here\n(4.1)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u = |u|p\u22121u + f (x),\n\nu \u2208 H01 (\u03a9)\n\nwhere \u03a9 \u2282 RN , N \u2265 3 is an open bounded regular domain, 1 < p <\nN +2\nand f \u2208 Lq (\u03a9) for some q > N2 . We prove the following result\nN \u22122\nTheorem 4.1. Under the assumptions above there exists a \u03b1 > 0 such\nthat when ||f ||q \u2264 \u03b1 the equation (4.1) admits a positive solution on\n\u03a9.\nRs\nWe set g(s) = sp if s \u2265 0, g(s) = 0 if s \u2264 0 and G(s) = 0 g(t) dt.\nThe functional associated to (4.1) is defined on H := H01 (\u03a9) by\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n|\u2207u| dx \u2212\nG(u)dx \u2212 f u dx.\nIf (u) =\n2 \u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nUnder our assumptions it is standard to show that I \u2208 C 1 (H, R). We\nshall work with the norm ||u|| := ||\u2207u|| on H.\nRemark 4.2. The point of Theorem 4.1 is the existence of a positive\nsolution on \u03a9 without assuming a sign on f . If f \u2265 0 the result follows\ndirectly from the existence of a critical point for If .\n\n\f10\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\nLemma 4.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.1 there exists a\n\u03b2 > 0 and a \u03b3 > 0 such that for any f satisfying ||f ||q \u2264 \u03b2 the\nfunctional If has a critical point uf at a value cf \u2265 \u03b3 > 0.\nProof. Let ||f ||q \u2264 \u03b2 with \u03b2 > 0 to be determined later. First we show\nthat the functional If has a mountain pass geometry in the sense that\nIf (0) = 0 and\n(i) There exist a > 0, b > 0 such that if ||u|| = a then If (u) \u2265 b.\n(ii) There exists a v \u2208 H with ||v|| > a such that If (v) \u2264 0.\nTo prove (i) observe that, by Holder and Sobolev embeddings, for 1/q+\n1/q \u2032 = 1 and a C > 0,\n(4.2)\n\n1\n1\n||u+ ||p+1\nIf (u) = ||u||2 \u2212\np+1 \u2212 ||f ||q ||u||q \u2032\n2\np+1\n1\n\u2265 ||u||2 \u2212 C||u||p+1 \u2212 C||f ||q ||u||.\n2\n\nWe first fix a > 0 sufficiently small so that\n1\n1\n||u||2 \u2212 C||u||p+1 \u2265 ||u||2\n2\n4\n\nif ||u|| = a.\n\nThen we choose \u03b2 > 0 sufficiently small so that C ||f ||q a \u2264 18 a2 . At\nthis point (i) hold. To show (ii) it suffices to observe that taking a\nu \u2208 H with u > 0 on \u03a9 one has If (tu) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as t \u2192 +\u221e.\nNext we show that the Palais-Smale condition holds, namely that any\nPalais-Smale sequence admits a convergent subsequence. Let (un ) \u2282 H\nbe a Palais-Smale sequence for If at a level cf \u2208 R. We have, for n \u2208 N\nlarge enough,\n1 \u2032\nI (un )un\np+1 f\nZ\n\u00101\n\u0010\n1 \u0011\n1 \u0011\n2\n=\n||un|| \u2212 1 \u2212\nf un dx\n\u2212\n2 p+1\np+1 \u03a9\n\u00101\np\n1 \u0011\n\u2265\n||un ||2 \u2212\n\u2212\n||f ||H \u22121 ||un ||\n2 p+1\np+1\n\n(4.3) cf + 1 + ||un || \u2265 If (un ) \u2212\n\nand thus (un ) \u2282 H is indeed bounded. The fact that (un ) \u2282 H admit\na convergent subsequence is now standard since we work on a bounded\ndomain. At this point the assumption of the mountain pass theorem,\n\u0003\nsee [2], are satisfied and the lemma follows.\n\n\fSOME CONTINUATION PROPERTIES VIA MINIMAX METHODS\n\n11\n\nProof of Theorem 4.1. In view of Lemma 4.3 it just remains to show,\nby possibly decreasing the value of \u03b2 > 0, that the solution uf \u2208 H is\npositive on \u03a9. For this we consider the limit problem\n\u2212 \u2206u = g(u).\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe functional associated to (4.4) is\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n|\u2207u| dx \u2212 G(u)dx.\nI(u) =\n2 \u03a9\n\u03a9\nClearly, by construction of g, any critical point of I is nonnegative.\nMoreover if u \u2208 H is a non trivial critical point of I, by the Hoft\nmaximum principle we obtain that u > 0 on \u03a9 and also that its normal\nderivatives are strictly positive on \u2202\u03a9.\nNow we assume, by contradiction, that there exists a sequence (fn ) \u2282\nL (\u03a9) such that fn \u2192 0 in Lq (\u03a9) for which the corresponding sequence\nun := ufn remains non positive for any n \u2208 N. Clearly we shall reach a\ncontradiction if we manage to show that, up to a subsequence un \u2192 u\nwhere u \u2208 H is a non trivial solution for the problem (4.4). Indeed\nstarting from un \u2192 u in H, by standard elliptic regularity estimates,\nit follows that un \u2192 u in C 1 (\u03a9\u0304).\nq\n\nTo show this we first observe that (un ) \u2282 H is bounded. Indeed,\nfrom (4.3) where f is replaced by fn it is the case if (cfn ) \u2282 R+ remains\nbounded. But taking any fixed u \u2208 H with u > 0 we have, for a C > 0,\n(4.5)\n\ncfn \u2264 max Ifn (tu)\nt>0\n\n1\ntp\n\u2264 t2 ||u||2 \u2212\n||u||p+1\np+1 + t\n2\np+1\n\nZ\n\n|fn |u dx\n\n\u03a9\n\nand the bound on (cfn ) \u2282 R+ follows. Now when n \u2192 +\u221e,\nZ\nI(un ) = Ifn (un ) + fn un dx\n\u03a9\n\n+\n\nremains bounded since (cfn ) \u2282 R is bounded and\n(because (un ) \u2282 H is bounded). Also\nI \u2032 (un ) = If\u2032 n (un ) + fn \u2192 0\n\nR\n\n\u03a9\n\nfn un dx \u2192 0\n\nin H \u22121 .\n\nThus (un ) \u2282 H is a bounded Palais-Smale sequence for I. To conclude\nwe observe that since (un ) \u2282 H is a bounded Palais-Smale sequence\nfor I it converges strongly, up to a subsequence, in H towards a non\n\n\f12\n\nLOUIS JEANJEAN\n\ntrivial critical point of I. The fact that it is non trivial follows from\n\u0003\nthe estimate cfn \u2265 \u03b3 > 0. This ends the proof.\nRemark 4.4. Clearly under the assumptions of Theorem 4.1, equation\n(4.1) admits a second solution as a local minimum of If . But when\nf \u2192 0 this solution converges to 0 and there is no reason for it to be\npositive.\nRemark 4.5. A numerous literature (see for example [1, 7]) is devoted\nto the problem of finding two solutions or more, for equations of the\nform\n(4.6)\n\n\u2212 \u2206u + u = a(x)|u|p\u22121u + f (x),\n\nu \u2208 H 1 (RN ).\n\nSo far, up to our knowledge, multiple solutions are obtained only under\nthe assumption that f \u2265 0 on RN (and ||f ||H \u22121 small enough). An\ninteresting question would be to study if for problems of the type of\n(4.6) a multiplicity result can be obtained without requiring f to be\nnon negative. In that direction we suspect that the approach followed\nin Theorem 4.1 could proved useful.\nAcknowledgements: The author would like to thanks Professors M.\nOhta, C.A. Stuart, K.
