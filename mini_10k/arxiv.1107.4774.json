Here we demonstrate the implementation of a teleportation protocol, up to the single-shot measurement step, with superconducting\nqubits coupled to a microwave resonator. Using full quantum state tomography and evaluating an\nentanglement witness, we show that the protocol generates a genuine tripartite entangled state of\nall three-qubits. Calculating the projection of the measured density matrix onto the basis states of\ntwo qubits allows us to reconstruct the teleported state. Repeating this procedure for a complete\nset of input states we find an average output state fidelity of 88%.\n\nQuantum teleportation achieves the transfer of a quantum state from one physical location to another, even if\nthe sender has no knowledge about both the state to\nbe teleported and the location of the receiver [1]. In\naddition to its use in quantum communication [2], for\nexample in context of quantum repeaters [3], quantum\nteleportation also plays an important role in quantum\ninformation processing. For instance, it has been shown\nthat gate teleportation in combination with single qubit\noperations enables universal and fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation [4, 5] in a way closely related to cluster state\nquantum computation [6] which can be understood in a\nunified conceptual framework [7\u20139]. Due to the stringent\nrequirements on the control and read-out fidelity achievable for the multi qubit quantum system, teleportation\nhas so far only been experimentally realized in microscopic degrees of freedom with single photon [10\u201313] or\ncontinuous variable states [14, 15] and, more recently,\nwith ions [16\u201319]. Early experiments have also been performed with spins by use of nuclear magnetic resonance\ntechnique [20].\nRapid progress towards increasing the fidelity of control and read-out operations has also been made in\nmacroscopic systems, such as superconducting circuits.\nRecently, single qubit operations have been carried out\nwith fidelities of up to 99% [21] and two-qubit entangled states have been generated with fidelities of up to\n95% [22, 23]. Two-qubit algorithms, such as the Deutsch\nJozsa and Grover search algorithm, have been demonstrated [22, 24] and tripartite entangled states (GHZ and\nW) have been realized [25, 26].\nHere, we demonstrate a scheme to fully characterize\nthe operation of a teleportation circuit, without making\nuse of single shot read-out [27] or real-time feed-back [28],\nboth of which are challenging to realize simultaneously in\na three-qubit superconducting quantum processor at the\ncurrent state of the art. Even without explicitly realizing\nthese steps, which will be essential in future applications,\nour benchmarking process is able to provide crucial information on the operation and fidelity of the teleportation\n\nprocess up to the measurement step and thus presents an\nimportant achievement towards making use of teleportation in quantum processors realized in superconducting\ncircuits.\nIn the standard protocol, teleportation is performed\nusing non-local quantum correlations combined with classical communication. In this scheme (see Fig. 1a)) the\nsender is in possession of qubit A in an arbitrary state\n|\u03c8A i. In the first step (I), a maximally entangled pair is\ngenerated, e.g. using a Hadamard (H) gate followed by\na controlled-not (CNOT) gate, and shared between the\nsender (qubit B) and the receiver (qubit C). In the second step (II) the sender applies a CNOT gate on his two\nqubits followed by a H gate on qubit A generating an entangled three-qubit state |\u03a6\u0303i. In step III, the sender performs a measurement on his two qubits, which combined\nwith step II is equivalent to a measurement performed\n\n| \u03c8A \u001e\n\n\u2022\n\nH\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n| 0B \u001e\n\nRy\n\n| 0C \u001e\n\nRy\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nZ \u001d\u001c\u001f\u001e\n\nH\n\n|\u03a6\u001e\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u2022\n\nR -y\n\n\u2022 \u2022\n\nR -y\n\n\u2022\n\nIII\n\u2022\n\nZ \u001d\u001c\u001f\u001e\n\n~\n\nI+II\n\nb)\n\n| \u03c8A \u001e\n\n\u2022\n\u0014\u0018\u0015\u0019\u0016\u001a\u0017\u001b\n\n\u0014\u0018\u0015\u0019\u0016\u001a\u0017\u001b\n\n| 0B \u001e\n| 0C \u001e\n\nII\n\nI\n\na)\n\nX\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c8C \u001e\n\nIII\nTomography\n\narXiv:1107.4774v1 [quant-ph] 24 Jul 2011\n\n2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n|\u03a6\u001e\n\nFIG. 1. a) Circuit diagram of the standard protocol to teleport the state |\u03c8A i of qubit A to qubit C. Here, H is the\nHadamard gate, Z and X are the Pauli matrices \u03c3z and \u03c3x .\nThe CNOT gate is represented by a vertical line between the\ncontrol qubit (\u2022) and the target qubit (\u2295). b) The circuit\nimplemented in this experiment with controlled phase gates,\nindicated by vertical lines between the relevant qubits (\u2022),\n\u03b8\nand single qubit rotations Rn\u0302\nof angle \u03b8 about the axis n\u0302.\n\n\f2\nin the Bell basis. He then sends the digital results to\nthe receiver over a classical communication channel. Depending on these results, the receiver applies one of four\nunitary operations to his qubit to transform the state\n|\u03c8C i of qubit C into the state |\u03c8A i, completing the teleportation.\nIn our approach using superconducting qubits we realize steps I and II by combining single qubit rotations\nand two-qubit controlled phase gates, as illustrated in\nFig. 1b), to create the entangled state\n|\u03a6i =\n\n1\n{|0A 0B i \u2297 |\u03c8C i + |0A 1B i \u2297 (\u2212\u03c3x )|\u03c8C i\n(1)\n2\n+ |1A 0B i \u2297 (\u2212\u03c3z )|\u03c8C i + |1A 1B i \u2297 (\u2212i\u03c3y )|\u03c8C i} .\n\nIn this notation, it becomes clear that a measurement of\nqubits A and B collapses qubit C onto one of four possible states. If the measurement outcome is 00, 01, 10,\nor 11, qubit C is projected to the states |\u03c8C i, \u2212\u03c3x |\u03c8C i,\n\u2212\u03c3z |\u03c8C i or \u2212i\u03c3y |\u03c8C i, respectively. Instead of performing single qubit measurements on qubits A and B in step\nIII, we analyze the three-qubit entangled state |\u03a6i with\nfull quantum state tomography and reconstruct the teleported state by calculating the projection of qubits A\nand B onto the basis states |0A 0B i, |0A 1B i, |1A 0B i and\n|1A 1B i. We then characterize the transfer of the input\nstate |\u03c8A i to qubit C by performing process tomography conditioned on the projection onto the basis states\nof qubits A and B.\nAn optical microscope image of our sample consisting\nof three transmon qubits (A,B,C) [29] dispersively coupled to a microwave transmission line resonator is shown\nin Fig. 2 combined with the corresponding lumped element circuit diagram. The resonator has a bare resonance frequency of \u03bdr = 8.625 GHz and a quality factor\nof 3300. It acts as a coupling bus [30] between the qubits\nand allows to perform joint three-qubit readout by measuring its transmission [31]. The qubits have a slightly\nanharmonic ladder-type energy level structure. The first\ntwo levels are used as the computational qubit states\n|0i and |1i, while the second excited state |2i is used\nto perform two-qubit operations. For optimal coherence,\nwe designed qubits with maximal transition frequencies\nsmaller than \u03bdr and anharmonicities big enough to address the first excited state without exciting higher states.\nFrom spectroscopy we extract the maximum transition\nmax\nfrequencies \u03bdA,B,C\n= {6.714, 6.050, 4.999} GHz, charging\nenergies Ec /h = {0.264, 0.296, 0.307} GHz and coupling\nstrength to the resonator g/2\u03c0 = {0.36, 0.30, 0.34} GHz.\nTo maximize coherence, we independently tune each\nqubit transition frequency to \u03bd max using superconducting coils mounted underneath the chip. At this optimal bias point, we find energy relaxation times T1 =\n{0.55, 0.70, 1.10} \u03bcs and phase coherence times T2\u2217 =\n{0.45, 0.60, 0.65} \u03bcs.\nWith two local control lines at each qubit, shown\nin Fig. 2b), we perform arbitrary single qubit opera-\n\ntions with fidelity greater than 98% [21]. Resonant\nmicrowave pulses applied to the open-ended transmission line realize single-qubit rotations about the x and y\naxis [32]. Nanosecond time-scale current pulses applied\nto the transmission line passing by the SQUID loop control the qubit transition frequency realizing z-rotations.\nThe controlled phase (C-Phase) gate is implemented\nusing the avoided level crossing between |11i and\n|20i [33]. A fast magnetic flux pulse first shifts |11i\nnon-adiabatically into resonance with |20i. The system then oscillates between the two states with twice\nthe frequency of the cavity mediated transverse coupling\nAB\nstrength of J11,20\n= 36 MHz (between qubits A and B)\nBC\nand J11,20 = 23 MHz (between qubits B and C). After\nan interaction time t = 2\u03c0/2J11,20 , the system returns\nto the initial state |11i with an additional phase factor\n-1. No conditional phase is picked up by the other basis states |00i, |01i or |10i. Dynamic single qubit phases\nare canceled by adjusting the rotation axes of all subsequent single qubit operations appropriately. The full\ntwo-qubit gates between A and B, and between B and C\nare completed in 14 ns and 22 ns, respectively.\nWe characterize the teleportation process realized according to the circuit diagram in Fig. 1b) with full quantum state tomography using joint read-out [31] for a\ncomplete set of input basis states |\u03c8A i = {|0A\u221a\ni, |1A i,\n|\u2212A i, |+A i}. Here, \u221a\n|\u2212A i = (|0A i \u2212 i|1A i)/ 2 and\n|+A i = (|0A i + |1A i)/ 2. In Fig. 3a we show the measured density matrix \u03c1m = |\u03a6m ih\u03a6m | of the three qubit\nstate |\u03a6m i generated for the input state |\u2212A i as an ex-\n\nFIG. 2. a) Optical microscope image of the sample with three\nqubits coupled to a coplanar wavequide resonator with individual local microwave and magnetic flux-bias lines for each\nqubit. b) and c) show a close up of qubit B. d) Lumped element circuit diagram of the sample and measurement setup.\n\n\f3\naL\n\nReH\u03a1c L\n\nbL\nReH\u03a1L\n\nImH\u03a1L\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n000\n\n-0.2\n000\n\n0\n-0.5\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n\nImH\u03a1c L\n0.5\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n111\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n-0.5\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n111\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\ncL\nExpectation value XP\u0300\\\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\nI I I I I I X Y Z I I I I I I I I I X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X X X X X X X X X Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z\nI I I X Y Z I I I X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z I I I I I I I I I X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z\nX Y Z I I I I I I X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z I I I I I I I I I X X X Y Y Y Z Z Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z\n\n`\nPauli operators P\n\nFIG. 3. a) Real and imaginary part of the\u221ameasured three-qubit density matrix \u03c1m when applying the circuit shown in Fig. 1b)\nto the input state |\u03c8A i = (|0A i \u2212 i|1A i)/ 2. b) Teleported single qubit state at qubit C found by projecting \u03c1m from a) onto\n|0A 0B i and tracing out qubits A and B. c) Pauli sets for the state shown in a).\n\nample.

We\nnote that for this particular input state, |\u03a6i is a cluster state useful for one way quantum computation [6].\nFor the input states |0A i, |1A i and |+A i the fidelities\nare 82%, 79% and 80%, respectively, comparable to the\nbest fidelities of three-qubit entangled states realized in\nsuperconducting qubits so far [25, 26]. Also, the measured correlations (colored bars) present in \u03c1m expressed\nin terms of Pauli sets, displaying the expectation values\nof all nontrivial tensor products P of identity I and Pauli\noperators X, Y, Z for three-qubits, are in good agreement\nwith the expected ones (wireframe), see Fig. 3c).\nGenerally, the ideal three-qubit state |\u03a6i generated\nby the circuit is tripartite entangled as can be verified\nby calculating the three tangle (residual tangle) defined\nfor pure states [35]. Only for |0A i and |1A i the output\nstate |\u03a6i remains biseparable. To quantify the amount\nof entanglement in the measured state \u03c1m , we estimate\nthe three tangle \u03c43 (\u03c1) for mixed states via the convexroof extension [36]. The values \u03c43 (\u03c1) = {0.49, 0.52} > 0\ndemonstrate that GHZ-type tripartite entanglement was\nprepared for |\u03c8A i = {|\u2212i, |+i}. If we only want to verify\n\nthat \u03c1m contains tripartite entanglement without distinguishing between the GHZ and W class, we can use a\nwitness operator W = \u03b1I \u2212 |\u03a6ih\u03a6| [37]. Here, \u03b1 is the\nmaximal squared overlap of any biseparable state with\n|\u03a6i, which yields 0.5 for |\u00b1A i. For all biseparable states\nwe find Tr(W\u03c1) \u2265 0, whereas for the ideal tripartite entangled state \u03c1 = |\u03a6ih\u03a6| we find Tr(W\u03c1) = \u03b1 \u2212 1. According to this criterion Tr(W\u03c1m ) = \u22120.28 < 0 the measured state shown in Fig. 3a) clearly has tripartite entanglement. As derived in [38], the expectation value of the\nwitness operator also directly leads to a lower bound to\nthe generalized robustness of entanglement. It measures\nthe minimal amount of mixing of \u03c1m with an arbitrary\ndensity matrix \u03c3 such that \u03c1m +s\u03c3 is separable, for which\nwe find s \u2265 0.56.\nTo determine the fidelity of the teleportation process\nup to the measurement, we calculate the projection of \u03c1m\nonto the four basis states |0A 0B i, |0A 1B i, |1A 0B i, and\n|1A 1B i. The state of qubit C is then reconstructed by\ntracing out qubits A and B and renormalizing the density matrix to \u03c1C = TrAB (Pij \u03c1m Pij\u2020 )/Tr(Pij \u03c1m ), where\nPij are the projectors |iA jB ihiA jB | \u2297 IC . When projecting onto |0A 0B i, this state is expected to be identical to\nthe input state |\u03c8A i.

Absolute value of the \u03c7-matrix representation for the\nteleportation process which transfers the state of qubit A to\nqubit C for qubit A and B being projected to a) |0A 0B i, b)\n|0A 1B i, c) |1A 0B i and d) |1A 1B i. I is the identity matrix, X,\n\u1ef8 and Z the Pauli matrices \u03c3x , \u2212i\u03c3y and \u03c3z respectively.\n\nfrom the measured data for the input state |\u2212A i with a\nfidelity of 88%. For the other three projections, we find\nthe resulting states of qubit C \u2212\u03c3x |\u2212C i, \u2212\u03c3z |\u2212C i and\n\u2212i\u03c3y |\u2212C i with respective fidelities of 82%, 82% and 89%.\nTo fully characterize the teleportation circuit, we have\nperformed quantum process tomography of the state\ntransfer by repeating the procedure described above for\n|0A i, |1A i, |\u2212A i, and |+A i. With the known input states\nand the reconstructed state of qubit C after teleportation,\nwe calculate the process matrix \u03c7 of the transfer. The\nextracted matrices \u03c7m clearly demonstrate that the effective processes acting on the target qubit during teleportation are the unitary operations expected from Eq. (1),\nsee Fig. 4. Since the \u03c7m have only small imaginary elements < 0.07, we display the absolute value of \u03c7m for\nthe different calculated projections on qubits A and B to\nemphasize the deviations from the ideal matrices \u03c7t indicated by wireframes. The corresponding process fidelities\nFp = Tr(\u03c7m * \u03c7t ) are 82%, 78%, 84%, 87%, yielding 83%\naveraged over all measurement outcomes. The average\noutput state fidelity F\u0304 = (2Fp + 1)/3 is 88%, 85%, 89%,\n91% for each individual process, and 88% on average.\nIn summary, we have benchmarked a teleportation algorithm by tomographic reconstruction of the three-qubit\nentangled state generated by the circuit up to the single\nqubit measurements. Using an entanglement witness, we\nshowed that this state has genuine tripartite entanglement. We determined the fidelity of the teleported state\nby reducing the density matrix with projection and find\na high average output state fidelity suggesting that full\nteleportation above the classical limit of F\u0304 = 2/3 is likely\nto become possible in the near future with superconducting qubits by combining our setup with a high fidelity\nsingle shot readout, e.g. with Josephson bifurcation [27]\n\n\u2217\n\nThese authors contributed equally to this work.\n[1] C.
