Indeed,\nsuch a tool allows one to construct refined parametrices to geometric operators like\nthe Laplacian, leading to a precise description of the space of solutions and typically having important consequences and applications in spectral theory, scattering\ntheory, index theory and regularity theory. This has also applications to study\ncertain non-linear elliptic equations, see for instance [26],[15], [45] for recent works\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\nin that direction. Over the years, various types of pseudodifferential calculi have\nbeen introduced on non-compact and singular spaces, see for instance [24], [8], [29],\n[48], [22], [23] [20], [18], [13] and [44]. Such a diversity of calculi comes from the\nfact that different types of singularities usually require quite different treatments.\nStill, many of the examples above are concerned with a particular class of singular spaces: stratified pseudomanifolds. The notion of stratified pseudomanifold is\nrelatively easy to describe and has the advantage of including many important examples of singular spaces, going from manifolds with corners to algebraic varieties.\nOne could therefore hope for a relatively uniform treatment of pseudodifferential\noperators in this context. However, it is necessary to first choose a Riemannian\nmetric geometrically encoding the singularities. There are two natural choices. To\npresent these two choices, let us first consider a stratified pseudomanifold of depth\none, that is, with only one singular stratum, see Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\n\u2718\n\u2718\u2718\u2718\n\u2718\n\u2748\u2718\nL\n\u2773\n\u2748 \u2773\u2773\u2773\u2773\n\u2773\n\u2748\nE\u2748\n\u2748 \u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\n\u2718\u2773\n\u2748\u2773\n\u2773\u2773\u2773\n\u2748\n\u2773\n\u2748\n\u2748\n\u2718\u2718\n\u2718\u2718\n\u2748\u2718\n\u2773\u2718\n\u2748\u2748 \u2773\u2773\u2773\u2773\n\u2773\n\n\u2748\n\u2748\n\n\u2748\nE\u2748\n\nL\n\n\u2748\n\u2748\n\n\u2748\n\n\u2748\n\n\u2748\n\u2748\n\n\u2748\u2748\n\n\u2732\nr\n\nFigure 1. ged\n\n\u2732\nr\nFigure 2. gfc\n\nThe first choice, going back to Cheeger [7], is to consider an incomplete edge\nmetric, a prototypical example being a metric which in a neighborhood of the\nsingular stratum takes the form\n(1)\n\nged = dr2 + gE + r2 gL ,\n\nwhere r is the distance to the singular stratum, gE is a Riemannian metric on\nthe singular stratum (the edge) and gL is a choice of metric on the link. In this\nsetting, a pseudodifferential calculus was developed independently by Mazzeo [22]\nand Schulze [48]. In [22], the metric which is really used as a starting point is in\nfact the conformally related metric\nged\ndr2\ngE\n=\n+ 2 + gL ,\nr2\nr2\nr\na complete edge metric, which has the virtue of defining a Lie algebra of vector\nfields 'generating' the pseudodifferential calculus.\nAlternatively, one can consider a fibred cusp metric to encode the singularity,\nwhich is a certain type of complete Riemannian metric of finite volume on the\n\n(2)\n\nged =\ne\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n3\n\nregular stratum. A prototypical example of such metric is one which near the\nsingular stratum takes the form\n(3)\n\ngfc =\n\ndr2\n+ gE + r 2 gL .\nr2\n\nFor such a metric, a pseudodifferential calculus was introduced by Mazzeo and\nMelrose [23] starting with a Lie algebra of smooth vector fields associated to the\nconformally related metric\n(4)\n\ngfb =\n\ngfc\ndr2\ngE\n=\n+ 2 + gL .\n2\n4\nr\nr\nr\n\nBoth (1) and (3) have analogs on general stratified pseudomanifolds by iterating\nthe definition. The generalization of (1) is called an iterated edge metric [1] . An\nimportant source of examples of iterated edge metrics is given by certain constant\ncurvature metrics [26] and by K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics singular along a divisor [15].\nOn the other hand, we call the analog of (3) for a general stratified pseudomanifold\nan iterated fibred cusp metric, see Definition 2.3 below. For stratified pseudomanifolds of depth one, natural examples of such metrics are given by certain fibred\ncusp K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics, see [45].\nFor iterated edge metrics, an associated pseudodifferential calculus has been\nintroduced in [37] and [38] for operators of order zero and was used in [36]. There\nis also a recent survey [47] by Schulze giving a nice description of how his methods\ncan be adapted to stratified pseudomanifolds of higher depth. Adopting a Lie\ngroupoid point of view, one can obtain a pseudodifferential calculus by applying\nthe general method of [39] and [2], which works for both iterated edge metrics and\niterated fibred cusp metrics. This latter approach is suitable for certain applications\nin index theory, but the properness condition on the support of the operators makes\nit less appealing for the construction of refined parametrices. Still, in certain cases,\nthis can be avoided by introducing a length function, see [43].\nIn this paper, we propose to systematically develop and study a calculus of pseudodifferential operators on stratified pseudomanifolds equipped with an iterated\nfibred cusp metric. We call it the S-calculus. Our approach takes its inspiration\nfrom [23], which deals with the case of a stratified pseudomanifold of depth 1. In\nparticular, we start with a Lie algebra of smooth vector fields associated to iterated fibred corner metrics, a type of metrics conformally related to iterated\nfibred cusp metrics. To be able to consider stratified pseudomanifolds of arbitrary\ndepth, our starting point is the idea, going back to Melrose (see [1]), that a stratified pseudomanifold can be resolved by a manifold with fibred corners. This allows\nus to use blow-up techniques in a systematic way to construct the double space on\nwhich the Schwartz kernels of the operators can naturally be defined.\nTo prove that this pseudodifferential calculus is closed under composition, we\ndiverge from [23] and follow an approach closer in spirit to [18]. Beside the 'usual'\nprincipal symbol, we introduce a 'noncommutative' symbol for each singular stratum of the stratified pseudomanifold by restricting on a corresponding front face\nin the double space. This lead to a simple Fredholm criterion for polyhomogeneous pseudodifferential operators: an operator is Fredholm when acting on suitable Sobolev spaces if and only if it is elliptic and its 'noncommutative' symbols\nare invertible for each stratum. We say such operators are fully elliptic. For fully\nelliptic operators, we are able to construct a refined parametrix giving rise to a\n\n\f4\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\ncorresponding regularity result. This refined parametrix can also be used to show\nthat our calculus is spectrally invariant, namely, that an invertible operator (when\nacting on suitable Sobolev spaces) has its inverse also contained in the calculus.\nAlong the way, we have a parallel discussion that keeps track of the underlying\nLie groupoid and relates our approach with the one of [39] and [2]. This becomes\nparticularly useful at the end of the paper, where we establish a Poincar\u00e9 duality\nbetween the fully elliptic S-operators and the K-homology of the stratified pseudomanifold. In [36], such a Poincar\u00e9 duality was obtained using the pseudodifferential\noperators of [37] and [38]. Using instead groupoids, the first two authors introduced\nin [10] the noncommutative tangent space of a stratified pseudomanifold and showed\nits K-theory is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the K-homology of the stratified pseudomanifold.\nIn fact, they showed more generally that the C \u2217 -algebra of the noncommutative\ntangent space is dual in the sense of KK-theory to the C \u2217 -algebra of continuous\nfunctions of the underlying stratified pseudomanifold.\nA key feature of our approach is the introduction of the semiclassical S-double\nspace and its associated semiclassical S-calculus. This allows us to define a continuous family groupoid T FCX playing the role in our context of the noncommutative\ntangent space of [10]. By looking at the associated algebra of pseudodifferential\noperators, we can then provide a simple way of relating classes of fully elliptic Soperators with elements of the K-theory of T FCX (see Theorem 10.6 below). This\nallows us to use a hybrid combination of the operator theoretic methods of [36]\n(see also [33]) and the groupoid approach of [10] to obtain our Poincar\u00e9 duality\nresult in KK-theory, Theorem 11.1. In Theorem 11.4, we also provide an interpretation of this result in terms of a quantization map for full symbols of fully elliptic\nS-operators, relating in this way the points of view of [10] and [36].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we introduce the definition of\nmanifolds with fibered corners and recall from [1] how they can be used to 'resolve'\nstratified pseudomanifolds. In Section 2, we introduce a natural class of vector\nfields defined on a manifold with fibered corners X. This leads to the notion of\nS-pseudodifferential operators in Section 3. In Section 4, we review the definition\nof groupoid and explain its relevance to the present context. In Section 5, we\ndescribe how S-pseudodifferential operators act on smooth functions. Section 6\nis about suspended operators, which are used in Section 7 to introduce various\nsymbol maps for S-operators. In section 8, we prove that the composition of two\nS-operators is again a S-operator. In Section 9, we introduce natural Sobolev spaces\non which S-operators act and provide criteria to determine when a S-operator is\nbounded, compact or Fredholm. In Section 10, we introduce the semiclassical Sdouble space and the associated semiclassical S-calculus, as well as the Lie groupoid\nT FCX. This is used to obtain a relationship between classes of fully elliptic Soperators and elements of the K-theory of T FCX. Finally, in Section 11, we establish\na Poincar\u00e9 duality in KK-theory between T FCX and the stratified pseudomanifold\nS\nX associated to X and interpret it in terms of a quantization map.\nAknowledgement.

Manifolds with fibered corners and stratified pseudomanifolds\nLet X be a manifold with corners as defined in [27]. In particular, we are\nassuming that each boundary hypersurface H \u2282 X is embedded in X. This means\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n5\n\nthat there exists a boundary defining function xH \u2208 C \u221e (X) such that x\u22121\nH (0) = H,\nxH is positive on X \\ H and the differential dxH is nowhere zero on H. In such\na situation, one can choose a smooth retraction rH : NH \u2192 H , where NH is\na (tubular) neighborhood of H in X such that (rH , xH ) : NH \u2192 H \u00d7 [0, \u221e) is\na diffeomorphism on its image. We call (NH , rH , xH ) a tube system for H. A\nsmooth map \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y between manifolds with corners is said to be a fibration1\nif it is a locally trivial surjective submersion.\nDefinition 1.1. Let X be a compact manifold with corners and H1 , . . . , Hk an exhaustive list of its set of boundary hypersurfaces M1 X. Suppose that each boundary hypersurface Hi is the total space of a smooth fibration \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si where\nthe base Si is also a compact manifold with corners. The collection of fibrations\n\u03c0 = (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k ) is said to be an iterated fibration structure if there is a partial\norder on the set of hypersurfaces such that\n(i) for any subset I \u2282 {1, . . . , k} with \u2229 Hi 6= \u2205, the set {Hi | i \u2208 I} is totally\ni\u2208I\n\nordered.\n(ii) If Hi < Hj , then Hi \u2229 Hj 6= \u2205, \u03c0i (Hi \u2229 Hj ) = Si with \u03c0i : Hi \u2229 Hj \u2192\nSi a surjective submersion and Sji := \u03c0j (Hi \u2229 Hj ) \u2282 Sj is one of the\nboundary hypersurfaces of the manifold with corners Sj . Moreover, there\nis a surjective submersion \u03c0ji : Sji \u2192 Si such that on Hi \u2229 Hj we have\n\u03c0ji \u25e6 \u03c0j = \u03c0i .\n(iii) The boundary hypersurfaces of Sj are exactly the Sji with Hi < Hj . In\nparticular if Hi is minimal, then Si is a closed manifold.\nA manifold with fibred corners is a manifold with corners X together with an\niterated fibration structure \u03c0.

With the previous notation, for any j, Sj is naturally a manifold\nwith fibered corners. The hypersurfaces are the Sji with fibration \u03c0ji : Sji \u2192 Si\nfor any i such that Hi < Hj . The same goes for the fibres of \u03c0i . Precisely, if x\nbelongs to Si let Lxi := \u03c0i\u22121 (x). Then Lxi is a manifold with fibered corners, where\nthe boundary hypersurfaces are the Lxi \u2229 Hj with Hi < Hj and the corresponding\nfibration comes from the restriction of \u03c0j . Notice that in the special case where Hi\nis maximal, the fibre Lxi is a closed manifold.\nDefinition 1.3. A family of tube system (Ni , ri , xi ) for Hi , i = 1, . . . , k is an\niterated fibred tube system of the manifold with fibred corners X if the following\ncondition holds for Hi < Hj ,\nrj (Ni \u2229 Nj ) \u2282 Ni , xi \u25e6 rj = xi , \u03c0i \u25e6 ri \u25e6 rj = \u03c0i \u25e6 ri on Ni \u2229 Nj ,\n1A more standard terminology would be smooth fibre bundle.\n\n\f6\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\nand the restriction to Hj of the function xi is constant on the fibres of \u03c0j .\nIf X is equipped with an iterated fibred tube system, then for each Hi \u2208 M1 X,\nwe have an induced iterated fibred tube system on each fibre of \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si .\nSimilarly, there is an induced iterated fibred tube system on the base Si .\nTo see that manifolds with fibred corners always admit iterated fibred tube\nsystems, it is useful to describe tube systems in terms of vector fields. Given a tube\nsystem (NH , rH , xH ) for the boundary hypersurface H, one can naturally associate\nto it a vector field \u03beH \u2208 C \u221e (NH ; T X) such that\n\u2202\n.\n(rH , xH )\u2217 \u03beH =\n\u2202xH\nClearly, the tube system can be recovered from this vector field by considering its\nflow. More generally, if \u03b7H \u2208 C \u221e (X; T X) is a vector field which is inner pointing\nan nowhere vanishing on H, but tangent to all other boundary hypersurfaces, we\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncan construct a tube system (NH\n, rH\n, x\u2032H ) such that\n\u2202\n\u2032\n(rH\n, x\u2032H )\u2217 \u03b7H =\n\u2202x\u2032H\nby considering the flow of \u03b7H for some short period of time EH . Thus, to obtain\nan iterated fibred tube system, it suffices to associate a vector field \u03beHi to each\nboundary hypersurface Hi in such a way that,\n(i) The restriction \u03beHi |Hi is inner pointing and nowhere vanishing on Hi ;\n(ii) If Hi < Hj , then \u03beHi is tangent to Hj and there is a vector field \u03beji \u2208\nC \u221e (Sj , T Sj ) such that (\u03c0j )\u2217 ( \u03beHi |Hj ) = \u03beji , while \u03beHj is tangent to the\nfibres of the fibration \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si on Hi . Moreover, in a neighborhood of\nHi \u2229 Hj , we have that [\u03beHi , \u03beHj ] = 0.\nIndeed, the flows of these vector fields generates tube system for each boundary\nhypersurface. The condition that [\u03beHi , \u03beHj ] insures that the flows of \u03beHi and \u03beHj\ncommute, so that in particular xi \u25e6 rj = xi near Hi \u2229 Hj , while requiring \u03beHj to be\ntangent to the fibres of \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si insures that \u03c0i \u25e6 ri \u25e6 rj = \u03c0i \u25e6 rj near Hi \u2229 Hj .\nOn the other hand, the condition (\u03c0j )\u2217 ( \u03beHi |Hj ) = \u03beji insures that xi |Hj is constant\non the fibres of \u03c0j : Hj \u2192 Sj . Thus, by shrinking the tube systems if necessary, we\ncan insure they form an iterated fibred tube system.\nLemma 1.4. A manifold with fibred corners always admit an iterated fibred tube\nsystem.\nProof. By the discussion above, it suffices to find vector fields \u03beHi \u2208 C \u221e (X; T X)\nfor each boundary hypersurface Hi \u2208 M1 X in such a way that conditions (i) and\n(ii) above are satisfied. This requires to construct the vectors fields \u03beij on Sj as\nwell.\nRecall that the depth of X is the highest codimension of a boundary face of X.\nIf X has depth zero, that is, if X is a smooth manifold, the lemma is trivial. We\ncan thus proceed by induction on the depth of X to prove the lemma. In particular,\nfor each i, the base Si of the fibration \u03c0i is a manifold with fibred corners of depth\nsmaller than the one of X and we can assume we have vector fields satisfying (i)\nand (ii) on Si . We can denote the vector field associated to the boundary face Sji\nof Sj by \u03beji . Proceeding by recurrence on the partial order of the Si to construct\nthese vector fields, starting with Si minimal, we can assume furthermore that for\nHi < Hj < Hk , we have\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n7\n\n(iii) (\u03c0kj )\u2217 \u03beki |Skj = \u03beji .\nTo construct the vector fields \u03beHi on X, we can proceed by recurrence on M1 X\nstarting with maximal elements. For a maximal element Hi , we just choose \u03beHi \u2208\nC \u221e (X; T X) such that \u03beHi |Hi is inner pointing and nowhere vanishing on Hi and\nis tangent to the fibres of \u03c0j : Hj \u2192 Sj for Hj 6= Hi .\nSuppose now that Hi is a hypersurface such that for all Hj \u2208 M1 X with Hj >\nHi , the corresponding vector field \u03beHj has been constructed in such a way that\nconditions (i) and (ii) hold. To construct \u03beHi , we first define it on the maximal\nelements in {H \u2208 M1 X ; H > Hi }. Let Hj be such a maximal element. We choose\n\u03beHi |Hj \u2208 C \u221e (Hj ; T Hj ) in such a way that on Hj , we have that (\u03c0j )\u2217 ( \u03beHi |Hj ) = \u03beji .\nThis can be done by also requiring at the same time that [ \u03beHi |Hj , \u03beHk |Hj ] = 0\nnear Hi \u2229 Hj \u2229 Hk for Hk such that Hj > Hk > Hi . Indeed, we can do so by\nfirst constructing \u03beHi |Hj recursively on the boundary faces of Hj , starting with the\nboundary faces of smallest dimension, and extending the definition at the next level\nusing the flow of vector fields \u03beHk for Hj > Hk > Hi whenever possible. Thanks\nto the fact condition (ii) is satisfied by the vector fields \u03beHk , this can be achieved\nconsistently. In this process, we also require that \u03beHi |Hj be tangent to the fibres of\n\u03c0l : Hl \u2192 Sl for Hl < Hi . Using the flow of \u03beHj , we can then extend the definition\nof \u03beHi to a neighborhood of Hi \u2229 Hj .\nDoing this for all maximal elements in {H \u2208 M1 X ; H > Hi }, we then proceed\nrecursively to extend the definition of \u03beHi in a neighborhood of the other hypersurfaces of {H \u2208 M1 X ; H > Hi }. Thus, let Hk > Hi be given and suppose that \u03beHi\nhas already been defined in a neighborhood of Hj for Hj > Hi such that Hj > Hk .\nThen \u03beHi |Hk is already defined in a neighborhood of Hj \u2229Hk . As before, proceeding\nby recurrence on the boundary faces of Hk , we can extend the definition of \u03beHi |Hk\nto all of Hk in such a way that (\u03c0k )\u2217 ( \u03beHi |Hk ) = \u03beki and [ \u03beHi |Hk , \u03beHl |Hj ] = 0 near\nHk \u2229 Hl for Hk > Hl > Hi . We can also require \u03beHi |Hk to be tangent to the\nfibres of \u03c0l : Hl \u2192 Sl for Hl < Hi . Using the flow of \u03beHk , we can then extend the\ndefinition of \u03beHi to a neighborhood of Hk \u2229 Hi . Because the already defined vector\nfields satisfy condition (ii), this extension is consistent with the previous ones.\nThus, proceeding recursively, we can extend the definition of \u03beHi to a neighborhood of\n[\nHi \u222a H.\n{H\u2208M1 X ; H>Hi }\n\nWe can then extend this definition further in such a way that \u03beHi is tangent to the\nfibres of \u03c0k : Hk \u2192 Sk for Hk < Hi . This give us a vector field \u03beHi which together\nwith the already existing vector fields satisfies conditions (i) and (ii), completing\nthe inductive step and the proof.\n\u0003\nAs observed by Melrose and subsequently described in [1], there is a correspondence between manifolds with fibered corners and stratified pseudomanifolds. For\nthe convenience of the reader and in order to set up the notation, we will review\nthe main features of this correspondence and refer to [1] for further details.\nLet us first recall what are pseudomanifolds. We will use the notations and\nequivalent descriptions given by A. Verona in [53] and used by the first two authors\nin [10].\n\n\f8\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\nLet SX be a locally compact separable metrizable space. Recall that a C \u221e stratification of SX is a pair (S, N ) such that,\n(1) S = {si } is a locally finite partition of SX into locally closed subsets of SX,\ncalled the strata, which are smooth manifolds such that\ns0 \u2229 s \u03041 6= \u2205 if and only if s0 \u2282 s \u03041 .\nIn that case we will write s0 \u2264 s1 and s0 < s1 if moreover s0 6= s1 .\n(2) N = {SNs , \u03c0s , \u03c1s }s\u2208S is the set of control data, namely SNs is an open\nneighborhood of s in SX, \u03c0s :S Ns \u2192 s is a continuous retraction and\n\u03c1s :S Ns \u2192 [0, +\u221e[ is a continuous map such that s = \u03c1\u22121\ns (0). The map \u03c1s\nis either surjective or the constant zero function.\nMoreover if SNs0 \u2229 s1 6= \u2205, then the map\n(\u03c0s0 , \u03c1s0 ) :S Ns0 \u2229 s1 \u2192 s0 \u00d7]0, +\u221e[\nis a smooth proper submersion.\n(3) For any strata s, t such that s < t, the set \u03c0t (SNs \u2229S Nt ) is included in SNs\nand the equalities\n\u03c0s \u25e6 \u03c0t = \u03c0s and \u03c1s \u25e6 \u03c0t = \u03c1s\nS\n\nS\n\nhold on Ns \u2229 Nt .\n(4) For any two strata s0 and s1 the following two statements hold,\ns0 \u2229 s \u03041 6= \u2205 if and only if SNs0 \u2229 s1 6= \u2205;\nNs0 \u2229S Ns1 6= \u2205 if and only if s0 \u2282 s \u03041 , s0 = s1 or s1 \u2282 s \u03040 .\n\nS\n\nA stratification gives rise to a filtration. Indeed, if SXj is the union of strata of\ndimension \u2264 j, then,\n\u2205 \u2282S X0 \u2282 * * * \u2282S Xn =S X.\nS\nWe call n the dimension of X and X \u2022 :=S X \\S Xn\u22121 the regular part of SX. The\nstrata included in X \u2022 are called regular while strata included in SX \\ X \u2022 are called\nsingular. The set of singular (resp. regular) strata is denoted Ssing (resp. Sreg ).\nDefinition 1.5. A stratified pseudomanifold is a triple (SX, S, N ) where SX is\na locally compact separable metrizable space, (S, N ) is a C \u221e -stratification on SX\nand the regular part X \u2022 is a dense open subset of SX.\nGiven a stratified pseudomanifold, notice that the closure of each of its strata\nis also naturally a stratified pseudomanifold. Given a manifold with fibred corners\nX, there is a simple way of extracting a stratified pseudomanifold. Let H1 , . . . , Hk\nan exhaustive list of its boundary hypersurfaces and let \u03c0 = (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k ) be the\niterated fibration structure on X. On X, consider the equivalence relation\nx \u223c y \u21d0\u21d2 x = y or x, y \u2208 Hi with \u03c0i (x) = \u03c0i (y) for some Hi .\nWe denote by SX the quotient space of X by the previous equivalence relation and\nq : X \u2192 SX the quotient map. By construction, the restriction of q to X \\ \u2202X\nis a homeomorphism. We claim that SX S\nis naturally a stratified pseudomanifold.\nHk ), that is \u03c3i = Si \\ \u2202Si .

On can easily check that the map (\u03c0i \u25e6 ri , xi ) : ri\u22121 (Hi \\\nHk <Hi\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n9\n\n\u03c3i \u00d7 [0, \u221e[ S\nfactors through a map SNi \u2192 \u03c3i \u00d7 [0, \u221e[ where SNi is the image of\n\u22121\nHk )) \u2282 Ni in SX. This enables us to define a set of control data on\nri (Hi \\\nHk <Hi\n\nS\n\nX making it a stratified pseudomanifold. We call SX the stratified pseudomanifold\nassociated to the manifold with fibered corners X.\nConversely, to any stratified pseudomanifold, one can associate a natural manifold with corners. To see this, we need to recall the notion of depth, which is a\ngood measure of complexity of a stratified pseudomanifold.\nDefinition 1.6. Let (SX, S, N ) be a stratified pseudomanifold. Then the depth d(s)\nof a stratum s is the biggest k such that one can find k different strata s0 , * * * , sk\u22121\nsuch that\ns0 < s1 < * * * < sk\u22121 < sk := s.\nThe depth of the stratification (S, N ) of X is\nd(X) := sup{d(s), s \u2208 S}.\nA stratum whose depth is 0 will be called minimal.\n\nRemark 1.7. This definition is consistent with the notion of depth for manifolds with corners, which constitute a particular type of stratified pseudomanifolds.\nMoreover, if X is a manifold with fibred corners of depth k, then its associated\nstratified pseudomanifold S X also has depth k. Notice that different conventions\nfor the depth are also common, see for instance [1].\nLet (SX, S, N ) be a stratified pseudomanifold. For any singular stratum s, set\nS\nLs := \u03c1\u22121\ns (1). From [53], we know there is an isomorphism between Ns and Ls \u00d7\n[0, +\u221e[/ \u223cs where \u223cs is the equivalence relation induced by (x, 0) \u223cs (y, 0) when\n\u03c0s (x) = \u03c0s (y). This local triviality around strata enables to make the unfolding\nprocess of [6] (see also [10] for a complete description). If s is minimal, one can\nconstruct a pseudomanifold\n(SX \\ s) \u222a Ls \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u222a (SX \\ s)\nusing the gluing coming from the trivialization\nof the neighborhood SNs of s. If M is\nS\nthe set of minimal strata of SX and m = s\u2208M s is the union of the minimal strata\nof SX, then one can more generally construct the double stratified pseudomanifold\n!\nG\nS\n2X = ( X \\ m) \u222a\nLs \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u222a (SX \\ m)\ns\u2208M\n\nby gluing Ls \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] for s \u2208 M via the trivialization of the neighborhood SNs\nof s. Since all the minimal strata of SX are involved, notice that the depth of\n2X is one less that the one of SX. The stratified pseudomanifold 2X also comes\nwith an involution \u03c41 F\ninterchanging the two copies of SX \\ m with fixed point set\nidentified with Lm = s\u2208M Ls \u00d7 {0}. This fixed point set is naturally a stratified\npseudomanifold and come with a surjective map Lm \u2192 m induced by the retractions\nin each neighborhood SNs for s \u2208 M .\nIf SX has depth k, we can repeat this process k times to obtain a stratified pseudomanifold 2k X of depth 0, in other words, a smooth manifold. The manifold 2k X\ncomes with a continuous surjective map p : 2k X \u2192S X. At the jth step of this\nunfolding process, we get a stratified pseudomanifold 2j X with an involution \u03c4j\nand a fixed point set equipped with a surjective map as before. This lift to 2k X to\n\n\f10\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\ngive k involutions \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4k with k fixed point sets given by smooth hypersurfaces\nR1 , . . . , Rk equipped with smooth fibrations on each of their connected components.\nThe various bases of these fibrations are simply the smooth manifolds corresponding\nSk\nto the unfolded strata of SX.

The closure of any one of these copies is naturally a manifold with corners\nFC\nX with boundary hypersurfaces given by parts of the hypersurfaces R1 , . . . , Rk\nand have corresponding induced fibrations with bases given by manifolds with corners. These fibrations give FCX a structure of manifold with fibred corners. We call\nFC\nX the manifold with fibered corners associated to the pseudomanifold SX.\nUp to the identifications described below, the two previous operations are mutually inverse. Precisely, starting with a stratified pseudomanifold SX and letting\nFC\nX be the associated manifold with fibered corners, we have for any x, y in FCX\nthat x \u223c y if and only if p(x) = p(y). In other words, the map p factors through\na homeomorphism FCX/\u223c \u2212\u2192S X which is a diffeomorphism in restriction to each\nstrata and with respect to the control data. Conversely, starting with a manifold\nwith fibered corners X and letting SX be its associated stratified pseudomanifold,\nit can be seen that FCX is isomorphic to the original manifold with fibred corners X\nby noticing that the unfolding process described above has an analog for manifolds\nwith fibred corners obtained by gluing along boundary hypersurfaces and with the\nsame resulting smooth manifold 2k X.\n2. Vector fields on manifolds with fibred corners\nLet X be a manifold with corners with H1 , . . . , Hk an exhaustive list of the\nboundary hypersurfaces of X. For each i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, let xi \u2208 C \u221e (X) be a\nboundary defining function for Hi . Recall that\nVb (X) := {\u03be \u2208 \u0393(T X) ; \u03bexi \u2208 xi C \u221e (X) \u2200i}\nis the Lie algebra of b-vector fields. Notice in particular that a b-vector field \u03be \u2208\nVb (X) is necessarily tangent to all the boundary hypersurfaces of X. Suppose that\n\u03c0 = (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k ) is an iterated fibration structure on X.\nDefinition 2.1. The space VS (X) of S-vector fields on the manifold with fibred\ncorners (X, \u03c0) is\n(2.1) VS (X) := {\u03be \u2208 Vb (X); \u03be|Hi is tangent to the fibres of \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si\nand \u03bexi \u2208 x2i C \u221e (X) \u2200i}.\nRemark 2.2. This definition depends on the choice of boundary defining functions.\nTo lighten the discussion, we might sometime not mention explicitly the choice of\nboundary defining functions, but the use of S-vector fields and related concepts\nalways presuppose such a choice has been made to start with. Moreover, we will\nusually assume the boundary defining functions are induced by an iterated fibred\ntube system.\nAs can be seen directly from the definition, VS (X) is a C \u221e (X) module and is\nclosed under the Lie bracket. It is therefore a Lie subalgebra of \u0393(T X). More\ngenerally, the space Diff kS (X) of S-differential operators of order k is the space\nof operators on C \u221e (X) generated by C \u221e (X) and product of up to m elements of\nVS (X).\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n11\n\nAway from the boundary, a S-vector field is just like a usual vector field in\nC \u221e (X; T X). On the other hand, near a point p \u2208 \u2202X, it is useful to introduce\na system of coordinates in which S-vector fields admits a simple description. To\nthis end, let Hi1 , . . . , Hil be the boundary hypersurfaces of X containing the point\np \u2208 \u2202X. After relabelling if necessary, we can assume H1 , . . . , Hl are the boundary\nhypersurfaces containing p and that\nH1 < H 2 < * * * < H l .\n\n(2.2)\n\nLet xi \u2208 C \u221e (X) be the chosen boundary defining function for Hi .

Groupoids\n\nWe refer to [42, 21] for the classical definitions and constructions related to\ngroupoids and their Lie algebroids. We recall here the basic definitions needed for\nthis paper.\nA groupoid is a small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.\nLet us make this notion more explicit. A groupoid G is a pair (G (0) , G (1) ) of sets\ntogether with structural morphisms: the unit u : G (0) \u2192 G (1) , the source and range\ns, r : G (1) \u2192 G (0) , the inverse \u03b9 : G (1) \u2192 G (1) , and the multiplication \u03bc which is\ndefined on the set G (2) of pairs (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 G (1) \u00d7 G (1) such that s(\u03b1) = r(\u03b2). Here,\nthe set G (0) denotes the set of objects (or units) of the groupoid, whereas the set\nG (1) denotes the set of morphisms of G. The identity morphism of any object of\n\n\f18\n\nCLAIRE DEBORD, JEAN-MARIE LESCURE, AND FR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC ROCHON\n\nG enables one to identify that object with a morphism of G. This leads to the\ninjective map u : G (0) \u2192 G. Each morphism g \u2208 G has a \"source\" and a \"range.\"\nThe inverse of a morphism \u03b1 is denoted by \u03b1\u22121 = \u03b9(\u03b1). The structural maps satisfy\nthe following properties,\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nr(\u03b1\u03b2) = r(\u03b1) and s(\u03b1\u03b2) = s(\u03b2), for any pair (\u03b1, \u03b2) in G (2) ,\ns(u(x)) = r(u(x)) = x, u(r(\u03b1))\u03b1 = \u03b1, \u03b1u(s(\u03b1)) = \u03b1,\nr(\u03b1\u22121 ) = s(\u03b1), s(\u03b1\u22121 ) = r(\u03b1), \u03b1\u03b1\u22121 = u(r(\u03b1)), and \u03b1\u22121 \u03b1 = u(s(\u03b1)),\nthe partially defined multiplication \u03bc is associative.\n\nWe shall need groupoids with additional structures.\nDefinition 4.1. A Lie groupoid (resp. locally compact groupoid) is a groupoid\nG = (G (0) , G (1) , s, r, \u03bc, u, \u03b9)\nsuch that G (0) and G (1) are manifolds with corners (resp. locally compact spaces),\nthe structural maps s, r, \u03bc, u, and \u03b9 are differentiable (resp. continuous), the source\nmap s is a submersion (resp. surjective and open) and Gx := s\u22121 (x), x \u2208 M , are\nall Hausdorff manifolds without corners (resp. locally compact Hausdorff spaces).\nWe will also encounter the notion of continuous family groupoid ([41]).\nDefinition 4.2. A locally compact groupoid G is a continuous family groupoid\nwhen it is covered by open sets U with homeomorphisms \u03a6f = (f, \u03c6f ) : U \u2192\nf (U ) \u00d7 Uf where f \u2208 {r, s} and Uf \u2282 Rn such that the following holds:\n(1) for all (U, \u03a6f ) and (V, \u03a8f ) as above such that W = U \u2229 V 6= \u2205, the map\n\u03a8f \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121\n: \u03a6f (W ) \u2212\u2192 \u03a8f (W ) is of class C 0,\u221e , which means that x 7\u2212\u2192\nf\n\u22121\n\u03c8f \u25e6 \u03c6f (x, *) is continuous from f (W ) to C \u221e (\u03c6f (W ), \u03c8f (W )) (which has\nthe topology of uniform convergence on compacta of all derivatives);\n(2) The inversion and product maps are locally C 0,\u221e in the above sense.\nWe say that (U, \u03a6f ) is a C 0,\u221e local chart for (G, f ).\nA simple example of Lie groupoid is the pair groupoid associated to a smooth\nmanifold M . It is obtained by taking G (0) = M , G (1) = M \u00d7 M , s(x, y) = y,\nr(x, y) = x, (x, y)(y, z) = (x, z), u(x) = (x, x) and with inverse \u03b9(x, y) = (y, x).\nLike vector bundles, groupoids can be pulled back. More precisely, let G \u21d2 M\nbe a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid with source s and range r. If f : N \u2192 M\nis a surjective map, the pullback groupoid \u2217 f \u2217 (G) \u21d2 N of G by f is by definition\nthe set\n(4.1)\n\n\u2217 \u2217\n\nf (G) := {(x, \u03b3, y) \u2208 N \u00d7 G \u00d7 N | r(\u03b3) = f (x), s(\u03b3) = f (y)}\n\nwith the structural morphisms given by\n(1) the unit map x 7\u2192 (x, f (x), x),\n(2) the source map (x, \u03b3, y) 7\u2192 y and range map (x, \u03b3, y) 7\u2192 x,\n(3) the product (x, \u03b3, y)(y, \u03b7, z) = (x, \u03b3\u03b7, z) and inverse (x, \u03b3, y)\u22121 = (y, \u03b3 \u22121 , x).\nThe results of [35] apply to show that the groupoids G and \u2217 f \u2217 (G) are Morita\nequivalent when f is surjective and open.\nThe infinitesimal object associated to a Lie groupoid is its Lie algebroid, which\nwe define next.\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n19\n\nDefinition 4.3. A Lie algebroid A over a manifold M is a vector bundle A \u2192 M ,\ntogether with a Lie algebra structure on the space \u0393(A) of smooth sections of A and\na bundle map \u033a : A \u2192 T M whose extension to sections of these bundles satisfies\n(i) \u033a([X, Y ]) = [\u033a(X), \u033a(Y )], and\n(ii) [X, f Y ] = f [X, Y ] + (\u033a(X)f )Y ,\nfor any smooth sections X and Y of A and any smooth function f on M .\nThe map \u033a is called the anchor map of A. Note that we allow the base M in\nthe definition above to be a manifold with corners.\ns\n\nNow, let G = G (1) \u21d2 G (0) be a Lie groupoid. We denote by T s G the subbundle\nr\n\nof T G (1) of s-vertical tangent vectors. In other words, T s G is the kernel of the\ndifferential T s of s.\nFor any \u03b1 in G (1) , let R\u03b1 : Gr(\u03b1) \u2192 Gs(\u03b1) be the right multiplication by \u03b1. A\ntangent vector field Z on G (1) is right invariant if it satisfies,\n\u2013 Z is s-vertical, namely T s(Z) = 0.\n\u2013 For all (\u03b1, \u03b2) in G (2) , Z(\u03b1\u03b2) = T R\u03b2 (Z(\u03b1)).\nThe Lie algebroid AG of a Lie groupoid G is defined as follows [21],\n\u2013 The fibre bundle AG \u2192 G (0) is the restriction of T s G to G (0) . In other\nwords, AG = \u222ax\u2208G (0) Tx Gx is the union of the tangent spaces to the s-fibre\nat the corresponding unit.\n\u2013 The anchor \u03c1 : AG \u2192 T G (0) is the restriction of the differential T r of r to\nAG.\n\u2013 If Y : U \u2192 AG is a local section of AG, where U is an open subset of G (0) ,\nwe define the local right invariant vector field ZY associated with Y\nby\nZY (\u03b1) = T R\u03b1 (Y (r(\u03b1))) for all \u03b1 \u2208 G U := r\u22121 (U ) .\nThe Lie bracket is then defined by\n[ , ] : \u0393(AG) \u00d7 \u0393(AG)\n(Y1 , Y2 )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u0393(AG)\n7\u2192 [ZY1 , ZY2 ]G (0)\n\nwhere [ZY1 , ZY2 ] denotes the s-vertical vector field obtained with the usual\nbracket and [ZY1 , ZY2 ]G (0) is the restriction of [ZY1 , ZY2 ] to G (0) .\nRemark 4.4. When G is a continuous family groupoid, the vector bundle AG \u2192\nG (0) as defined above still exists. Indeed, the fibres Gx , x \u2208 G (0) are smooth\nmanifolds and we still can set\nG\nTx Gx .\n(4.2)\nAG =\nx\u2208G (0)\n\nThis vector bundle is smooth in the sense of [41] and it is called the Lie algebroid\nof G again.\nIn this paper, a central example of Lie algebroid is given by \u03c0 T X with anchor\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nmap given by the natural map \u03b9\u03c0 : \u03c0 T X \u2192 T X. In fact, the space X\u03c02 \u222a ff \u03c0 has a\nnatural structure of Lie groupoid with Lie algebroid naturally identified with \u03c0 T X\nunder the identification X \u223c\n= \u2206\u03c0 .

The Lie groupoid G\u03c0 admits a decomposition into\nsimpler groupoids. Indeed, for each boundary hypersurface Hi of X, notice that\nthe subgroupoid\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n[\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(ff \u03c0i \u2229ff \u03c0 ) \\ \uf8ed\n(ff \u03c0j \u2229 ff \u03c0i \u2229ff \u03c0 )\uf8f8\nHi <Hj\n\nis naturally isomorphic to the pull-back groupoid \u2217 \u03c0i\u2217 (\u03c0 N Si ). Since these sub\u25e6\n\ngroupoids give a partition of ff \u03c0 , this means that, forgetting about the Lie structure,\nthe groupoid G\u03c0 can be written as a disjoint union of groupoids,\n!\nk\nG\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 G\n\u2217 \u2217 \u03c0\n\u223c\n\u03c0 ( N Si ) .\nG\u03c0 = (X \u00d7 X)\ni\n\ni=1\n\nSince G\u03c0 is a smooth groupoid, one can consider the space \u03a8(G\u03c0 ) of pseudodifferential operators on G\u03c0 [34, 39, 2]. Conditions on the supports of these operators are\nnecessary to perform their products. They corresponds to those pseudodifferential\n(1)\noperators of (3.25) whose Schwartz kernels are compactly supported in G\u03c0 . Thus,\nthe space of operators in (3.25) is not much larger. It replaces the condition of\n(1)\ncompact support in G\u03c0 by a condition of Schwartz decay at 'infinity' with the in(1)\nfinity and the decay condition specified by the natural compactification X\u03c02 of G\u03c0 .\nStill, it has an important consequence. In the larger space (3.25), the inverse of\nan invertible pseudodifferential is automatically contained in the same space (with\nminus the order of the original operator), a fact which is not true for the smaller\nspace \u03a8(G\u03c0 ). This is intimately related with the well-known fact that the Fourier\ntransform is an automorphism of the space of Schwartz functions on Rn , but does\nnot preserve the space smooth functions with compact support.\nFor G a locally compact groupoid, we need a Haar system to define an associated\nC \u2217 -algebra. Recall first that a (right continuous) Haar system [42] on G is a family\n(\u03bbx )x\u2208G (0) of (positive, regular, Borel) measures \u03bbx on G such that\n(1) the support of \u03bbx is equal to (the whole of) Gx ,\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n21\n\nR\n(2) for all f \u2208 Cc (G), the map x 7\u2192 Gx f (\u03b3)d\u03bbx is continuous,\nR\nR\n(3) for all \u03b3 \u2208 G and f \u2208 Cc (G), on has Gr(\u03b3) f (\u03b3 \u2032 \u03b3)d\u03bbr(\u03b3) = Gs(\u03b3) f (\u03b3 \u2032 )d\u03bbs(\u03b3) .\n\nHaar systems always exist on continuous family groupoids. Given a continuous\nHaar system, the space Cc (G) is endowed with natural product and involution, and\nthis involutive algebra is then automatically represented in an appropriate Hilbert\nspace as well. This leads to the notions of reduced C \u2217 -algebra of G, usually denoted\nby Cr\u2217 (G), and of universal (maximal) C \u2217 -algebra of G, usually denoted by C \u2217 (G).\nDifferent Haar systems provide up to isomorphism the same reduced and universal\nC \u2217 -algebras[42, 41]. Moreover, if E is a Hermitian vector bundle on G (0) , then\nthe space of sections Cc (G, r\u2217 E) has also natural Hilbert Cr\u2217 (G) and C \u2217 (G)-modules\ncompletions denoted by Cr\u2217 (G, E) and C \u2217 (G, E). Often, the reduced and universal\ncompletions coincide, in which case we omit the subscript r in Cr\u2217 . For the groupoids\nconsidered in this paper, this can be seen using the following general criterion.\nLemma 4.5. If a measured groupoid G is the finite disjoint union of measurewise amenable (see [3, Definition 3.3.1]) groupoids Gi , that is, G = \u2294i\u2208I Gi and\n(0)\nG (0) = \u2294i\u2208I Gi , where everything is assumed to be borelian, then G is measurewise\namenable. In particular, C \u2217 (G) is nuclear and equal to Cr\u2217 (G).\nProof. The fact G is measurewise amenable follows from [3, Proposition 5.3.4] ap(0)\nplied to the Borel map q : G (0) \u2192 I defined by q(x) = i if x \u2208 Gi . By [3, 6.2.14],\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u0003\nwe then have that C (G) is nuclear and equal to Cr (G).\nFor instance, this criterion can be applied to the groupoid G\u03c0 .\nLemma 4.6. The groupoid G\u03c0 is measurewise amenable. In particular, C \u2217 (G\u03c0 ) is\nnuclear and equal to Cr\u2217 (G\u03c0 ).\nProof. By Lemma 4.5, it suffices to observe that G\u03c0 can be written as a disjoint\nunion of topologically amenable (and thus measurewise amenable, by [3]) groupoids,\n!\nk\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 G G\n\u03c0\n(Hi \u00d7 T Si \u00d7 Hi )|Gi \u00d7 R ,\n(4.8)\nG\u03c0 = (X \u00d7 X)\ni=1\n\n\u03c0i\n\n\u03c0i\n\nwhere Gi = Hi \\(\u222aj>i Hj ). The topological amenability of the various subgroupoids\non the right-hand side can be justified as follows,\n(i) A vector bundle is topologically amenable as a bundle of abelian groups;\n(ii) Topological amenability is preserved under equivalence of groupoids ([3]).\nFor instance, given a vector bundle E \u2192 S and a locally trivial fibre bundle\np : H \u2192 S, the groupoid (H \u00d7 E \u00d7 H) \u21d2 H is equivalent as a groupoid to\np\n\np\n\nthe vector bundle E, and thus is topologically amenable;\n(iii) The cartesian product of amenable groupoids is amenable.\n\u0003\n5. Action of S-pseudodifferential operators\nLet us first consider the space \u03a8m\nS (X; E, F ) in (3.25) in the simpler situation\nwhere E = F = C.

To describe the\naction of S-operators on functions, we will need the following result about the\npushforward of conormal distributions.\n\nLemma 5.1. The map \u03c0L = prL \u25e6\u03b2\u03c0 : X\u03c02 \u2192 X induces a continuous linear map\n(\u03c0L )\u2217 : I m (X\u03c02 ; \u2206\u03c0 ) * Cff\u221e\u03c0 (X\u03c02 ; \u03a9) \u2192 C \u221e (X; \u03a9).\nProof. If K \u2208 I m (X\u03c02 ; \u2206\u03c0 ) * Cff\u221e\u03c0 (X\u03c02 ; \u03a9) is supported near the lifted diagonal, then\nthe result follows from general properties of conormal distributions together with\nthe fact the map \u03c0L is transversal to \u2206\u03c0 . Thus, using a cut-off function, we can\nassume K \u2208 Cff\u221e\u03c0 (X\u03c02 ; \u03a9). To proceed further, notice that \u03c0L is a b-fibration (we\nrefer to [27] for a definition). Indeed, as a blow-down map, \u03b2\u03c0 is a surjective\nb-submersion. Since the projection prL : X 2 \u2192 X is also clearly a surjective bsubmersion, so is the composite \u03c0L = prL \u25e6\u03b2\u03c0 . Thus, according to Proposition 2.4.2\nin [27], \u03c0L is a b-fibration provided no boundary hypersurface of X\u03c02 is mapped\nto a boundary face of X of codimension greater than one. This is clear for the\n'old' hypersurfaces in X\u03c02 , while the 'new' hypersurfaces are mapped under \u03b2\u03c0\nto boundary faces of X 2 of codimension 2 which are then mapped under prL to\nboundary faces of codimension 1 under the projection prL .\nThe lemma can then be seen as a special case of the Push-forward Theorem of\n[28] for b-fibrations. Precisely, the lemma is a consequence of this theorem combined\nwith the fact\n\u22121\n(Hi ) \u2229 ff \u03c0 = ff \u03c0i\n\u03c0L\nfor all boundary hypersurfaces Hi \u2282 X.\n\n\u0003\n\nSince the previous lemma is dealing with smooth densities, it cannot be applied\ndirectly to the space of conormal distributions \u03a8m\nS (X).\nLemma 5.2.

It suffices to notice that the singular factors of sections of \u03b2\u03c0\u2217 (pr\u2217L \u03a9\u2297pr\u2217R \u03c0 \u03a9)\nall arise at faces not contained in ff \u03c0 , and so are absorbed by the infinite order\nvanishing at these faces. This can be seen using the local coordinates. Indeed, in\nthe coordinates (3.12), an element of C \u221e (X\u03c02 ; pr\u2217L \u03a9 \u2297 pr\u2217R (\u03c0 \u03a9) is of the form\nhdxdydzdx\u2032 dy \u2032 dz \u2032\nhdxdydzdx\u2032 dy \u2032 dz \u2032\n,\n= Ql\nQl\n\u2032 ki +1\n\u2032 2+dim Si\n\u2032\ni=1 (xi )\ni=1 xi (wi )\n\nfor some h \u2208 C \u221e (X\u03c02 ).\n\nThus, in the coordinates of (3.15), it takes the form\ne\nhdSdY dzdx\u2032 dy \u2032 dz \u2032\n\nfor some e\nh \u2208 C \u221e (X\u03c02 ),\n\nand the only possible singular terms occur when Si \u2192 \u221e or Yi \u2192 \u221e, that is, at\nfaces not contained in ff \u03c0 .\n\u0003\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n23\n\nWe can then define a push-forward map\n\u2217\u03c0\n\u03a9) \u2192 C \u221e (X)\n(\u03c0L )\u2217 : I m (X\u03c02 ; \u2206\u03c0 ) * Cff\u221e\u03c0 (X\u03c02 ; \u03c0R\n\n(5.2)\n\n\u2217\u03c0\nby requiring that for K \u2208 I m (X\u03c02 ; \u2206\u03c0 ) * Cff\u221e\u03c0 (X\u03c02 ; \u03c0R\n\u03a9) and any non-vanishing\n\u221e\nsection v \u2208 C (X; \u03a9),\n\u2217\nv * (\u03c0L )\u2217 K = (\u03c0L )\u2217 (\u03c0L\nv * K),\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere the right hand side of (5.3) is in C \u221e (X; \u03a9) thanks to Lemma 5.1 and\nLemma 5.2. This push-forward map provides a way to make S-pseudodifferential\noperators act on functions. To state the main result of this section, we still need\nto introduce some notation.

Via the push-forward map (5.2), an element P \u2208 \u03a8m\nS (X; E, F )\ndefines a continuous linear map\nP : C \u221e (X; E) \u2192 C \u221e (X; F ).\nFor each subset A \u2282 M1 X, this map restricts to give a continuous linear map\n\u221e\n\u221e\nP : C \u0307A\n(X; E) \u2192 C \u0307A\n(X; F ).\n\nThese maps extend by continuity in the distributional topology to linear maps\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nP : C \u0307A\n(X; E) \u2192 C \u0307A\n(X; F )\n\nfor all subsets A \u2282 M1 X.\nProof. The first assertion is a consequence of Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2.

The iterated fibration structure \u031f of\nV \u00d7 X is naturally induced from those of V and X as follows. The fibration \u031f0 on\nthe boundary hypersurface Z0 = \u2202V \u00d7 X is given by the projection on \u2202V , while\nthe fibration of the boundary hypersurface Zi = V \u00d7 Hi is given by \u031fi = Id \u00d7\u03c0i .\nThe partial order on the boundary hypersurfaces of V \u00d7 X is specified by requiring\nthat for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k},\n(6.1)\n\nZ0 < Zi ,\n\nZi < Zj \u21d0\u21d2 Hi < Hj .\n\nFinally, the boundary defining function of Zi = V \u00d7 Hi is taken to be the pullback\nof xi to V \u00d7 X, while we choose the boundary defining function x0 of Z0 to be the\npullback of \u03c1V to V \u00d7 X.\nLet E and F be smooth complex vector bundles on V \u00d7 X obtained by pulling\nback complex vector bundles on X to V \u00d7 X. Consider then the space \u03a8m\nS (V \u00d7\nX; E, F ) of S-operators of order m acting from sections of E to sections of F .

Similarly, if \u03bd\ndenotes the translation invariant density on V associated to our choice of inner\nproduct h*, *iV , then we can define the Fourier transform\n(6.14)\n\nFE : S(V \u00d7 X; E) \u2192 S(V \u2217 \u00d7 X; E)\n\nby\n(6.15)\n\nu\nb(\u03a5) = FE (u)(\u03a5) =\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212i\u03a5*v u(v)\u03bd,\n\n\u03a5 \u2208 V \u2217,\n\nV\n\nwith inverse Fourier transform given by\n\nZ\n1\nei\u03a5*v u\nb(\u03a5)\u03bd \u2217 ,\n(2\u03c0)dim V V \u2217\nwhere \u03bd \u2217 is the density on V \u2217 dual to \u03bd.

It is important however to notice that the Fourier transform of an operator\nP \u2208 \u03a8m\nS\u2212sus(V ) (X; E, F ) is not an arbitrary smooth family of S-operators.

Composition\nTo show that S-operators compose nicely, various strategy could be used. One\napproach consists in defining pseudodifferential operators using Lie groupoids as in\n[39], in which case the fact the composition of operators in the calculus remains\nin the calculus follows directly from the definition. As indicated earlier, the disadvantage with such an approach is that the inverse of an invertible operator is\nnot typically within the algebra. Another approach, developed by Melrose and\ncollaborators (see for instance [23]), is to consider a triple space suitably blown\nup where composition can be represented by a pushforward map coming from a\nb-fibration. The result then follows from the description in [27] of general mapping\nproperties that such pushforward maps satisfy. Such an approach is likely to work\nin our context, but might involves a rather complicated triple space. Instead, we\nwill proceed by less geometric means and follow the approach of [18] by working\nlocally and using a proof by induction on the dimension of the manifold with fibred\ncorners.\nTheorem 8.1.

A similar\nresult holds for polyhomogeneous S-operators.\nTo describe the inductive step in the proof of this theorem, consider, for p \u2208 N,\nthe new manifold with corners Rp \u00d7 X where Rp is the radial compactification of\nRp as described in [31].

Without loss of generality, we can assume E = C is the trivial vector bundle.\nBy definition, the space of compact operators K(H) is the closure in L(H) of operators of finite ranks. Clearly, since C \u0307\u221e (X) is dense in L2g\u03c0 (X), we can as well define\nK(H) as the closure of finite rank operators represented by an element of \u03a8\u0307\u2212\u221e\nS (X).\nThese operators of finite rank are certainly dense in \u03a8\u0307\u2212\u221e\n(X).\nThus,\nK(H)\nis given\nS\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nby the closure of \u03a8\u0307S (X) in L(H). Since the map \u03a8S (X) \u2192 L(H) is continuous,\n\u2212\u03b4\nwe conclude that the closure of \u03a8\u0307\u2212\u221e\n(X) in \u03a8\u2212\u03b4\nS\nS (X), namely, x\u03a8S (X), is included\nin K(H).\nConversely, let A \u2208 \u03a8\u2212\u03b4\nS (X) be a compact operator. Suppose for a contradiction\nthat \u03c3\u2202i (A) 6= 0 for some i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}.

Let V be\na small neighborhood of yi \u2208 Si such that the fibration \u03c0i : Hi \u2192 Si is trivial over\nV, namely, there is a diffeomorphism \u03c8 : \u03c0i\u22121 (V) \u2192 Fi \u00d7 V inducing a commutative\ndiagram\n(9.28)\n\n\u03c0i\u22121 (V)\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\u274b\u03c0i\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\"\"\n\n\u03c8\n\nV\n\n// V \u00d7 Fi\n22\n22\n2\n22 prL\n|| 2\n2\n\nwhere prL : V \u00d7Fi \u2192 V is the projection on the left factor. Let \u03b9i : Hi \u00d7[0, \u01eb)xi \u2192 X\nbe a tubular neighborhood of Hi in X compatible with the boundary defining\nfunction xi . Using the diffeomorphism \u03c8, we can identify the open set \u03b9i (\u03c0i\u22121 (V) \u00d7\n[0, \u01eb)xi ) \u2282 X with the open set\n(9.29)\n\nV \u00d7 Fi \u00d7 [0, \u01eb)xi .\n\nChoosing V to be smaller if needed, we can assume it is diffeomorphic to an open\nball in the Euclidean space. Let y be a choice of coordinates on V such that the\npoint yi \u2208 V corresponds to y = 0. On the open set V \u00d7 (0, \u01eb)xi , consider the\ncoordinates\n1\ny\n(9.30)\nu= , v= .\nxi\nxi\nConsidering alternatively v and u as linear coordinates on the vector space \u03c0i Nyi Si =\nTyi Si \u00d7 Ru , we regard V \u00d7 (0, \u01eb)xi as an open subset in \u03c0i Nyi Si , and consequently\nwe can regard U = V \u00d7 Fi \u00d7 (0, \u01eb)xi as a subset of \u03c0i Nyi Si \u00d7 Fi = \u03c0i Nyi Hi .

Since we assume that the support of\nf is compact, by taking k sufficiently large, we can insure that the support of f\nis contained in the open set U. In fact, since the operator \u03c3\u2202i (A) is translation\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n43\n\ninvariant, we will still have that (9.27) holds after translating f in the u variable,\nso without loss of generality, we can assume that the support of fk is contained in\nU for all k \u2208 N0 . Again, by translation invariance of \u03c3\u2202i (A), we will have that\n\u03c3\u2202i (A)|yi fk 6= 0\nfor all k \u2208 N0 . Since the function fk is supported in U, we can also regard it as\na function on X. Let \u03c7 \u2208 Cc\u221e (V \u00d7 Fi \u00d7 [0, \u01eb)xi ) be a cut-off function such that\n\u03c7 \u2261 1 in a neighborhood of {yi } \u00d7 Fi \u00d7 {0}. Thus, if we consider the operator\nP = \u03c7A \u2208 \u03a8\u2212\u03b4\nS (X), P will also obviously be compact, and we will have that\n\u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi = \u03c3\u2202i (A)|yi .\nNow, thanks to the cut-off function \u03c7, the action of P on f \u2208 Cc\u221e (U ) \u2282 C \u221e (X) is\ngiven by:\nZ\nKP (u, v, u\u2032 , v \u2032 , z, z \u2032 )fk (u\u2032 , v \u2032 , z \u2032 )du\u2032 dv \u2032 dz \u2032 ,\nP fk (u, v, z) =\nU\n\nwhere the integral is in the sense of distributions. Similarly, the action of \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi\ncan be described by\nZ\n\u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fk (u, v, z) =\nK \u03c3\u2202 (P )| (u, v, u\u2032 , v \u2032 , z, z \u2032 )fk (u\u2032 , v \u2032 , z \u2032 )du\u2032 dv \u2032 dz \u2032\nU\n\ni\n\nyi\n\nSince as a function on U \u2282 X, the support of the function fk is uniformly approaching the fibre \u03c0i\u22121 (yi ) \u2282 Hi as k \u2192 +\u221e, we see from the definition of the normal\noperator that we must have that as k tends to infinity,\nP fk \u2212 \u03c3\u2202i (P )fk \u2192 0\n\n(9.32)\n\nin the L2 -norm defined by the S-metric\ng + du2 + dv 2 + gFi ,\nwhere gFi is a choice of S-metric on Fi . By translation invariance of this metric\nand of \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi , we have that, on \u03c0i Nyi Hi ,\nk \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fk kL2 = k \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi f kL2 6= 0\nIf we restrict \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fk to U, we still clearly have that\nlim k \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fk kL2 (U ) = k \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fkL2 (\u03c0i Nyi Si ) 6= 0.\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nOn the other hand, \u03c3\u2202i (P )|yi fk being moved to infinity as k \u2192 \u221e, we see that\nit converges pointwise to zero everywhere on U, so that the sequence \u03c3\u2202i (P )fk\ncannot converge in L2 . We conclude from (9.32) that the sequence P fk also fails\nto converge in L2 . Since by translation invariance of the metric, the sequence fk\nis bounded in L2 , this contradicts the fact P is a compact operator. To avoid\na contradiction, we must conclude that \u03c3\u2202i (A) = 0 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, which\ncompletes the proof.\n\u0003\nMore generally, there are natural Sobolev spaces associated to S-operators. As\nbefore, let g\u03c0 be a S-metric on X and let E \u2192 X be a complex vector bundle with\na Hermitian metric, so that we have a corresponding space L2g\u03c0 (X; E) of square\nintegrable sections.

More precisely, for m > 0, let Am \u2208 \u03a8S2 (X; E) be a choice of elliptic\nS-operator and consider the formally self-adjoint operator Dm \u2208 \u03a8m\nS (X; E) defined\nby\n(9.36)\n\nDm = A\u2217m Am + IdE .\n\nLemma 9.8. For m > 0, the operator Dm is fully elliptic and invertible. In\nparticular, its inverse D\u2212m := (Dm )\u22121 is an element of \u03a8\u2212m\nS (X; E).\nProof. Let H1 , . . . , Hk be the boundary hypersurfaces of X and suppose that they\nare labelled in such a way that\nHi < Hj =\u21d2 i < j.\nWe will first prove by induction on i \u2208 {1, . . . , k} starting with i = k that \u03c3\u2202i (Dm )\nis fully elliptic and invertible. For i = k, the fibres of the fibration \u03c0k : Hk \u2192 Sk\nare closed manifolds, so that in this case, \u03c3\u2202k (Dm ) is automatically fully elliptic\nsince it is elliptic. Thus, for i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, the inductive step we need to show is\nthat if \u03c3\u2202i (Dm ) is fully elliptic, then it is invertible. To see this, fix s \u2208 Si and\nconsider the \u03c0 Ns Si -suspended operator \u03c3\u2202i (Am )s above s. For a fixed \u03a5 \u2208 \u03c0 Ns\u2217 Si ,\nconsider the operator\nm \u22121\n(s); E).\nQ = \u03c3\u2202\\\ni (Dm )(\u03a5) \u2208 \u03a8S (\u03c0i\n\u2217\nThus, if B = \u03c3\u2202\\\ni (Am )(\u03a5), we have that Q = B B + IdE . By Proposition 9.1, if\n\u22121\n\u221e\nQu = 0, then u \u2208 C \u0307 (\u03c0i (s); E). Thus, we have in particular\n\nQu = 0 =\u21d2 hu, B \u2217 Bu + uiL2 ,\n(9.37)\n\n=\u21d2 kBuk2L2 + kuk2L2 = 0,\n=\u21d2 u \u2261 0.\n\nThus, since Q is formally self-adjoint, we have that ker Q = ker Q\u2217 = {0}, so that Q\nis invertible. Since \u03a5 \u2208 Ns\u2217 Si was arbitrary, this means that \u03c3\u2202i (Dm )s is invertible.\nThus, since s \u2208 Si was arbitrary, this means that \u03c3\u2202i (Dm ) is invertible, which\ncompletes the inductive step.\nWith this argument, we see Dm is fully elliptic. In particular, by Proposition 9.1,\nif Dm u = 0, then u \u2208 C \u0307\u221e (X; E). We can then show Dm is invertible using a similar\nargument as in (9.37), which completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\fPSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON MANIFOLDS WITH FIBRED CORNERS\n\n45\n\nUsing the operator Dm with Dm = (D\u2212m )\u22121 for m < 0 and D0 = IdE , we can\nthen define an inner product on HSm (X; E) by\nhu, viHSm (X;E) = hDm u, Dm viL2g\u03c0 (X;E) ,\n\n(9.38)\n\nwith corresponding norm\nkukHSm (X;E) = kDm ukL2g\u03c0 (X;E) .\n\n(9.39)\n\nUsing Theorem 9.4, it is straightforward to check HSm (X; E) is precisely the closure\nof C \u0307\u221e (X; E) with respect to this norm.\nProposition 9.9.

The result of [32] is not formulated in terms of Dirac elements, but this can be\nremedied easily by using the semiclassical b-double space (or the semiclassical cusp\ndouble space). For the convenience of the reader, we will provide a brief outline.\nFirst, the semiclassical b-double space is defined by\n2\n= [Xb2 \u00d7 [0, 1]\u01eb ; \u2206b \u00d7 {0}],\nXb\u2212sl\n\nwhere \u2206b \u2282 Xb2 is the lifted diagonal. Denote the new face obtained by this blowup by ff 0,b . Notice that the b-tangent bundle is naturally included in ff 0,b . If ff b\u2212sl\nis the union of all the boundary hypersurfaces intersecting the lift of \u2206b \u00d7 [0, 1] in\n2\nXb\u2212sl\n, we get a corresponding groupoid\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nT b X := ff b\u2212sl \\ (ff b\u2212sl \u2229 Xb2 \u00d7 {1}).\nUsing evaluation maps as in the fibred corners case, one can define a natural\nb\nKasparov cycle \u2202X\n\u2208 KK(C \u2217 (T b X), C). There is also a 'zero sections' morb\nphism \u03a8X : C(X) \u2297 C \u2217 (T b X) \u2192 C \u2217 (T b X), and so a corresponding Kasparov cycle\nb\nb\nDX\n= [\u03a8bX ] \u2297 \u2202X\nin KK(C(X) \u2297 C \u2217 (T b X), C).\nLet H1 , . . . , Hk be an exhaustive list of boundary hypersurfaces of X and set\nXj = X \\\n\nj\n[\n\nHi ,\n\nXj\u2032 = X \\\n\ni=1\n\nk\n[\n\nHi ,\n\ni=j+1\n\nb\nwith the convention that X0 = X = Xk\u2032 .

Thus, assume the proposition is true for all manifolds\nwith corners of depth less than the one of X.
