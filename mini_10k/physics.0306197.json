The\nparameter space explored in this time resolved study includes variation of scale length, laser polarization and laser intensity in conjunction.

We model the results in terms of Resonance Absorption and Wave-Breaking mechanisms.\nThe Harmonic and X-ray emission show contrasting behaviour, which indicates pitfalls in trying\nto increase harmonic efficiencies by brute force. However by simple adjustments, we observe that\nhard X-rays can be enhanced or controlled upto two orders of magnitude and second harmonic\nupto one order of magnitude under optimum conditions. These results should help us understand\nthe governing mechanisms for short wavelength generation and fast particle generation to develop\nmore efficient sources for application purposes.\n\n1\n\n\fThe advent of short pulse and high peak power laser technology has fuelled development of\nnew sources of light and fast particles. This also has resulted in development of new ideas and\nphysics behind interaction of high intensity light with matter. There is immense interest in\nunderstanding and increasing efficiency of High Harmonic Generation (HHG) from different\nmedia like gases, solids, clusters and liquid drops etc. HHG is the most promising way of\ncreating XUV [1, 2, 3] and water-window photon sources [4] for applications in lithography,\nreal time imaging of biological samples. Similarly the electron and ion acceleration using\nhigh power lasers has resulted in advances in realizing Tabletop particle accelerator schemes\n[5]. Another important area concerns the yeilds and applications of short pulse X-ray sources\nusing laser-solid interaction [6],[7] for probing atomic and nuclear motions.\nIn intense laser-solid iteraction, which is our main concern in this work (although the\nreults may be valid for liquids, clusters as well), it is a common knowledge that the collective processes like resonance absorption and plasma oscillations play an important role\nin high harmonic and X-ray generation. The resonance absorption phenomenon has been\nexpensively studied in literature. Since it is leads to strong excitation of electron plasma\nwaves (EPW) near critical density, the growth and decay of these plasma waves thus plays\ncrucial role. Such dynamical aspects of plasma waves have been theoretically been studied\nextensively using analytical and numerical techniques, although experimental verification\nand understanding is still lagging much behind. As an example the concept of electron\nplasma wavebreaking invoked first by Dawson [8] is particularly intresting and significant\n[9, 10] as it has been understood as the mechanism responsible for the generation of fast\nparticles observed in laser-solid experiments. However hardly any direct experimental evidence of the effect in context of high intensity laser plasma interaction. There has been\none experimental report [11] invoking wavebreaking (WB), however, it does not go into details of the phenomenon, but stops merely at hinting towards the existence of wavebreaking\nphenomenon. In view of ever increasing intensities of lasers it seems inevitable that plasma\nwaves of large amplitudes do not break. Thus undoubtedly, there is immense importance of\nEPW dynamics in deciding the efficiencies of plasma emmission both of coherent type (High\nHarmonic Genration) and incoherent type (fast particle and hard X-ray generation).\nWe here do an detailed experimental study and modelling of the EPW phenomenon over\nlarge parameter space. The parameters that were simultaneously varied in conjunction for\nthis time resolved study included the scale length of plasma, the laser polarization, the pump\n2\n\n\flaser internsity, the prepulse laser intensity. The observables include pump reflectivity, probe\nreflectivity, Second Harmonic Generated (SHG) by the pump, Hard-Xray emmitted and the\nspectrum of the reflected fundamental and SHG. We establish important mechanisms, which\noperate and control harmonic and X-ray emissions from plasmas. The simple optimization\nof conditions is shown to lead to X-ray enhancements by two orders of magnitude and\nsecond harmonic by one order of magntitude. The results also show that parameter space\nfor optimisation of X-ray and harmonic yields can be very different and the difference results\nfrom process of plasma wave breaking. The results also indicate pitfalls in simple minded\napproach to increase harmonic efficiencies by brute force increase of laser intensity.\nThe experimental set-up consists 1016 W cm\u22122 pump (100 fs, 800nm) incident at 45\u25e6 with\nrespect to target normal. The prepulse is 50 times weaker than pump and at near normal\nincidence. We monitor the input laser, reflected pump, reflected probe with photodiodes\n(Hamamatsu) and the second harmonic generated by pump is monitored with PMT (Hamamatsu). The SHG emmission was observed to be specular in our experiments. The target\nused in this study is solid glass (BK7) 2\" \u00d7 2\" \u00d7 5mm pieces. Finally NaI (Tl) detector\nappropriately gated with respect to laser, placed at 22.5\u25e6 with respect to target normal is\nused to measure the hard X-ray emissions from the plasma in the energy range from 30 to\n500 keV. This experiment involved variation of scale length of preplasma and polarization\nplane of main laser pulse and intensities of pump and probe, unlike any previous studies\nwhere at most one variation was considered at a time leading to incomplete picture.\nFirst we compare the hard X-ray and SHG measurements as a function of prepulse to\nmain pulse time delay (i.e. as function of scale length of preplasma) at fixed polarization of\npump (p-polarization), fixed pump intensity (1016 W cm\u22122 ), fixed probe intensity (50 times\nweaker than pump). The results are shown in figure 1. We have plotted integrated hard Xray yeild over 30-500keV and second harmonic efficiency which defined as \u03b7 = I(2\u03c9)/I 2(\u03c9)\nwith time delay. In both the plots the data are normalized with respect to yeilds obtained\nwith the pump alone acting, thus the baseline value for pump alone acting is normailzed to\nunity in each case. The most conspicuous feature is contrary behaviour of Second Harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) and X-rays near vicinity of 24 ps delay. The X-ray yield is seen to enhance\nby a factor of 140 ,i.e. more than tw order of magntitude, when compared to yield with\npump alone indicating large amount of fast electron generation near 24 ps. The SHG on\nthe other hand shows a dip around 24 ps thus exhibiting perfect anti-correlation with X-ray\n3\n\n\fdata. The maximum enhancement in SHG at the peak values around the dip is 3 times\nwhen normalized with respect to main pulse acting alone. At the dip the SHG is still about\n1.5 times the value without prepulse. The baseline, which has been normalized to unity\nhere, corresponds to absolute SHG efficiency of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 with p-pump and at least 50 times\nlower for s-pump alone.\nNext instead of comparing total yeilds of X-rays with and without prepulse we now spectrally resolve the X-ray yeilds and compare hot electron temperatures at different positions.\nOne with only pump acting which corresponds to points on baseline of figure 1(b) and other\nwith prepulse dealy of 24 ps that at position where X-ray yeild enhances by a factor of\n140. The result shown in figure two shows enhanced hot electron temperatures at 24 ps.\nComparison of the hot electron spectra shows that; in absense of prepulse, we get 3 keV as\nmain temperature component, while the second component is almost insignificant as seen\nfrom statistical weights. With the prepulse at 24 ps, the we require two temperatures for\ngood fit, 5 and 37 keV, the second temperature being very prominent unlike the first case.\nThis indicates strong RA is operational and large quantity of fast particles is being generated, with optimised prepulse delay of 24 ps. A resonable explanation of these results lies\nin the phenomenon of excitation of plasma waves via Resonance Absorption (RA). RA is\ncrucially dependent on the scale length of the plasma and the component of electric field\nparallel to density gradient driving the plasma waves i.e. polarization of the pump pulse. It\nis expected that at certain optimum length scale there will be maximal RA, where plasma\nwaves are driven very hard. Similarly in going from S- to P-polarization we are effectively increasing the E field component along density gradient, which is driving plasma waves under\nconditions of resonance absorption.\nWe next establish these facts quantitavely using the reflectivity of the main pulse to deduce the scale lengths of preplasma(Fig 3). The top x-axis is time delay and bottom axis\nrepresents scale length resulting from prepulse deduced by numerically calculated reflectivity\n(solid curve) solving Helmoltz equation in a sharp density profile [12], with a collision frequency of 0.05\u03c9. Thus the scale length at 25 ps where we see phenomenon of enhancement\nof X-rays and simultaneous dip of SHG is \u223c \u03bb under our conditions. This region around\nL \u223c \u03bb (time delay 15-25 ps) corresponds to maximum absorption and hence large number\nof plasma waves are strongly driven in this resonance absorption region. (Remember the\ndefination of scale length is important, here we are deducing actually total plasma length,\n4\n\n\fscale length may be smaller than this, depending on the profile used.)\nNow that resonance absorption(RA) is clearly established, we attempt to explain the\nfigure 1 and 2. As noted earlier in near resonance region we do expect large amplitude plasma\nwaves driven strongly by the laser. Hence these plasma waves when damping can be invoked\nto explain enhanced X-ray yeilds and temperatures. However this explanation is clearly not\nsufficient when to attempt to exlplain the SHG data, in particular the strong dip around\neactly the position where large amount of fast particles are being generated. Thus we have to\nlook more carefully at the behavior of strongly driven plasma waves. As the SHG current is\nassumed to come from two contribitions one term proportional to pondemotive force which\nwill be effective both for s and p-polarization and other term proportional to \u2207.ne E which\nis strongly active for plasma waves driven by p-polarized laser. Now if the plasma waves\nstart breaking when driven too hard the second term which is main contribution will be\ndisrupted and hence we will get decrease of SHG. Since we are actually driving plasma very\nvery hard hence it is not unexpected that wave breaking will set in when density fluctuation\nbecomes of the order of unperturbed density itself. Thus the wavebreaking phenomenon\nwhich is theoretically understood very well has to be invoked here to undertand the results.\nIn addition here we can measure the exact conditions for the onset of wave breaking. This\nshould help in testing the theoretical and numerical wave breaking models .\nNow we model the physics of wavebreaking relevant to our conditions and parameters.\nThe starting point is the equation kp eEp /m\u03c9 2 \u2265 1 for breaking of the plasma wave i.e. the\nratio of the amplitude of the oscillation of the electron to the wavelength of the plasma wave,\nwhere kp , Ep is the wave vector and electric field of the plasma wave. Further observing Ep =\nEd /\u01eb, where Ed is the driving electric field and \u01eb is dielectric constant. The dielectric constant\nwill have a non zero minimum value at critical layer, (due to finite width of resonance region?)\nand minimum value is obtained by averaging over half a wavelength aroung resonance. We\nget \u01ebmin = \u03c0/(2kmin L) = \u03bbp /4L, where L is plasma scale length. Now we use kp = 2\u03c0/\u03bbp ,\n2/3\n\nand \u03bbp = \u03bbde L1/3 for thermal plasma waves. Now putting this together and using the\ndefination Eth = kTe /e\u03bbde substituting in the original condition, we get the wave breaking\ncondition (WBC) as (Ed /Eth )(L/\u03bbde )1/3 \u2265 1. The driver field can either be calucated\nnumerically again using solution of Helmoltz calculation in steep density profile done above\nfor fitting pump reflectivity or one can simply get the resonance absorption from denisov\nfunction. Then assuming a temperature of 200 eV, we plot the WBC for different peak\n5\n\n\flaser intensities in figure 4. The flat line at W BC = 1 represents the critical limit necessary\nfor wavebreaking. The denisov function relfectivity is also plotted at the bottom. The\nWBC for low intensities is not satisfied and hence waves will not break for intensity of order\n1014 W cm\u22122. However as we increase the intensity the WBC is satifies over larger and\nlarger scale lengths. At the maximum intensity 1016 W cm\u22122 waves can break over almost\nupto 1.5\u03bb. Hence we verify that wavebreaking does occur comfortably over our range of\nparameters. In addition this illustrates that wavebreaking is ubiquitous in intense laser\nplasma interaction studies done around or above 1016 W cm\u22122.\nNow we revisit figure 1 with these results. The hard Xray enhancement is explained\nas during wavebreaking the energy lost by the wave will be converted to kinetic energy of\nelectrons, thus the accelerated electrons will result in enhanced bremsstrahlung, in agreement with our experimental results. In case of SHG we can understand that as the scale\nlength changes, we pass through resonance absorption region where plasma wave amplitude\nincreases to high value leading to breaking of plasma waves. As we know wave breaking\nresults in disruption of the non-linear source current thus explaining the dip observed in\nSHG. However still we need to explain the non zero value of 1.5 SHG efficiency at dip position at 24 ps. The reason for related to the fact for a given laser pulse which typically has\n40-50 laser cycles, each one exciting plasma waves. Thus at each cycle we can define the\nintensity of inident wave and hence driver field for the plasma wave. Thus we have to view\nit as highly dynamical situation in 100 fs duration. As we increase peak intensity of laser\npulse; at certain critical intesity the plasma waves related to peak of the laser pulse start to\nbreak thus reducing SHG, however, the wings of laser still produce SHG efficiently. As pulse\npeak value of intensity is increased further more and more laser cycles near peak contribute\nto plasma wavebreaking. However still there is some non-broken waves at the wings which\nwill keep SHG to non zero value. If we make simple estimate in case of peak pulse intensity\nof 1016 W cm\u22122 , the laser cycles with peak intensity below 1/50 of peak will not break as\nseen from the figure 4. Now if we estimate for a gaussian pulse roughly 1/10 of energy of\npulse is contained in the wings below the wave breaking threshold which will continue to\nyeild SHG. This clearly is not enough as the dip at 24 ps is only factor of two lower that\nthe maximum SHG efficiency observed, where energy in wings is expected to yeild much\nlower SHG efficiency. The explanation behind this lies in the fact that even in the case of\nmaximum SHG position in figure 1, there is enough wavebreaking present, which keeps the\n6\n\n\fmaximum value of SHG signal low. Hence one should compare the efficiency for 24 ps dip\nposition to the maximum value which would have been there in totally wave breaking free\nexperiment.\nTo make the situation clear and to substantiate above claims we now study the behavior of SHG with scale length at low and high intensity cases. Figure 5 shows three\ncases: p-polarized pump at high intensity (1016 W cm\u22122 ), p-polarized pump at low intensity\n(2x1015 W cm\u22122 ) and s-polarized pump at high intensity (1016 W cm\u22122 ) For the sake of comparison we have multiplied the efficiencies in each case by factor indicated in the figure 5.\nThis is done in such a way that value for pump alone acting is each case is same as for\nhighest intensity p-polarized pump case which as shown already in figure 1 to be normalized\nto unity. Thus the curve for s-polarized case in reality is a lower in SHG efficiency value\nby a factor of 65 that of high intensity p-polarized case and the low intensity p-polarized\ncase is a factor of 20 below that of high intensity case. It is obvious from the figure 5\nthat at low intensities Indeed if we reduce the peak laser pulse intensity we see that maximum SHG efficiency in low intensity case is as large as a factor 13 compared to pump\nalone acting. Thus this experiment is relatively wavebreaking free version of high intensity\nstrongly wavebreaking case, where the maximum SHG efficiency goes only upto factor of 3\nbefore dipping. Also now the finite non zero SHG efficiency value of 1.5 at the dip at 24 ps\nin high intensity plot, when compared to maximum value of 13 in low intensity relatively\nwavebreaking free yeilds a contrast of about a factor of 1.5 to 13, which can be explained\nto be due SHG generated in the wings of the pulse. This disscussion on comparison of high\nand low intensity cases also make it clear that wavebreaking is taking place not only in the\nscale length regime where SHG shows a dip, but over a large range of scalelengths. Further\nthe scale length region of validity of WBC increases with increasing intensity. Finally SHG\nefficiency for s-polarization although very low can be explained to be due to pondermotive\neffect and this effect can also keep SHG to a finite value. In addition source of SHG in case\nof s-polarization is due to imperfect polarization state of the laser (purity 99 percent) and\nfocussing geometry effects over the spatial spot size of the laser.\nFurther we now see the intensity scaling of SHG at fixed delay positions (5ps,21 ps)\nand polarization state (p-pol). The results are plotted in figure 6. Also plotted are the\nfits assuming SHG yeild varies as square of incident intensity. We observe that the scling\ndeviates from exponent value of 2, at intensity equivalent 0.1 of the maximum intensity. The\n7\n\n\fdeviation from square scaling is also observed to be earlier in case when the delay is at 21\nps i.e. the dip position and final difference in values of fit and observed values is also much\nlarger, than observed at 5 ps.\nNow same arguements used above for scale length variation study of wavebreaking can\nbe used in case of polarization variation. As we change the polarization from S to P we\nare increasing the driving field for elctron plasma waves and hence their amplitude. This\nultimately leads to breaking of the waves when a critical limit is reached. Figure 7 shows\nthe dependence of X-ray yield as a function of pump polarization for two cases, with and\nwithout prepulse. With prepulse at 24 ps (maximum yeild position in figure 1), we observe\nthat going from S-pol to P-pol we can enhance X-ray yield by two orders of magnitude.\nWithout prepulse however maximum change is atmost a factor of 2. Thus in conjunction\nwith a prepulse, laser polarization can be a very effective and simple way to control X-ray\nyield over a wide dynamic range. Inset of fig 7 shows the ratio of two yields above i.e.\nwith and without prepulse as function of polarization. The enhancement is maximum for\nP-polarization and insignificant for S-polarization. This demonstrates of a simple way to\ncontrol X-ray yeilds over two orders of magntitude. Merely by rotating the half wave plate\none can tune X-ray yeilds to a factor of 100 if there is a prepulse present at right delay. If\nhowever prepulse were not present the rotation of half wave plate will not yeild even a factor\n2 variation.\nSame effect can be observed in SHG also where the wavebreaking is brought about clearly.\nWe compare polarization dependence of SHG ahown in figure 8. The SHG behaviour without\nand with a prepulse at 7ps, which is position of peak enhencement of SHG is completely\nopposite to that of X-rays. There is enhancement in both cases i.e. with and without prepulse\nfor all polarization states, however the relative enhancement (the ratio of yields with and\nwithout prepulse) is maximum for S-polarization (\u223c 14) whereas only 3 for P-polarization\n(inset fig 3). Comparing insets of figure 7 and figure 8, we have an important observation\nnamely that the enhancement ratio curve as a function of polarization is opposite for X-rays\nand SHG due to wavebreaking effects.\nFinally the spectrum of SHG in direction collinear with reflected pump is shown in figure\n9. At negative delay the spectrum is smooth. For p-polarization at positive delays as we go\nnear the dip position the spectrum starts becoming more and more distorted and split.\nIn conclusion, the novel time resolved simultaneous study of SHG and X-rays as a function\n8\n\n\fof scale length and laser polarization elucidates features of electron plasma wave dynamics.\nThe Harmonic and X-ray emission yeilds are observe over wide range of parameters. We\ninterpret the results in terms of Resonance Absorption and Wave-Breaking mechanisms.\nThe modelling of results is in good agreement with observed results. We propose SHG is a\nvery sensitive indicator of wave breaking and can be useful tool for understanding plasma\nwave dynamics. Under optimum conditions we observe that hard X-rays can be enhanced\nby a factor of 100 and second harmonic by factor of 10. The plasma scale length and laser\npolarization when used in conjunction, provide a wide dynamic range and are thus most\neffective as controlling parameters of short wavelength sources for application purposes.\nWe would like to thank D.
