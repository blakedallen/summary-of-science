These involve nodes of two kinds, and their\nedges only link nodes of different guilds.\nThe examples issuing from biology concern ecological\nsystems. These are complex ensembles of living beings\nsharing a complicated pattern of mutual dependence and\ninteracting in many intricate ways. A number of these\nsystems provide valuable services to mankind and considerable attention is currently being paid to their stability taking into account human disturbance. A sustainable management of ecosystems can only be achieved if\na proper understanding is reached concerning how these\nsystems are assembled. As far as biological systems are\nconcerned we will discuss the case of mutualistic systems.\nThey involve two groups of species, usually animals and\nplants, that interact to fulfill essential biological functions such as feeding or reproduction. This is the case of\nsystems involving plants and animals that feed from the\nfruits and disperse their seeds (seed dispersal networks).\nAnother example is that of insects that feed from the\nnectar of flowers while pollinating them in the process\n(pollination networks).\nBipartite networks can also be found in social systems.\nExamples of this type involve the actors and movies they\nparticipate in [3] or the boards of directors of large companies and their members [1].\nAn important feature of bipartite networks is the de-\n\ngree distributions of the nodes of both guilds. In social\nsystems the statistical properties of the degree distributions of each guild are different. While the distribution\nassociated to one guild approximately follows a power\nlaw, the degrees of the other distribute themselves as\na bell shaped (Poisson-like) curve around some average\nvalue. In biological systems the degree distributions of\nboth guilds decay slower than exponentially thus having\nfat tails. In spite of the fact that observed mutualistic\nsystems are rather small, these distributions have been\nfitted by truncated power laws.\nIn addition it has been observed [4], [5] that in biological, mutualistic networks all the contacts (links) tend\nto be nested and limited by a curve[4], [6] defined as an\nisocline of perfect order [7].\nIn a nested network the nodes of both types can be\nordered by decreasing degree in such a way that the set\nof species linked with each species in the list is contained\nin the set associated to the preceding one. This organization is such that the generalists of both type of guilds (i.e.\nthose nodes interacting with a great number of nodes of\nthe other guild) tend to interact among them while there\nare no contacts among specialists (i.e. nodes interacting\nwith very few of the other guild). All these features indicate that these networks are far from being a random\ncollection of interacting species, displaying instead a high\ndegree of internal organization.\nIn preceding papers we have introduced the Selforganizing Network Model (SNM) [6], [8] to describe\nnested biological webs. Within that model, the topology\nof the network is the result of a self-organization process\n\n\f2\nin which its nodes progressively redefine their links obeying to a purely local rule that does not depend upon any\nglobal feature of the network. The network undergoes in\nthis fashion an ordering process.\nThis self-organization process by no means represents\nany growth or assembling process of the ecological system. It represents instead the search of a pattern of contacts between both guilds that tends to optimally take\ninto account some contact preference rule (CPR) that is\nassumed to prevail among the nodes of the network. The\naim of this model is to trace a possible causal relationship between the detailes of a local rule governing the\ncontacts between both guilds and the statistical features\nof the network. In fact, the results obtained in [6] under\none specific assumption for such CPR accurately account\nfor many observed statistical features of real mutualistic\nwebs of widely different sizes.\nIn this article we present a generalization of the SNM\nto cast into a single framework the organization of both,\nmutualistic and social webs. We thus aim at establishing\nsimilarities and differences between social and biological\nnetworks by linking their statistical properties with the\nCPR that governs the interactions between both guilds.\nThe fact that nodes of one guild share contacts with\nnodes of the other kind, allows us to define a pattern\nof interactions among similar nodes [1]. Any bipartite\nnetwork can also be regarded as describing two separate\nsystems involving only nodes of one kind. The corresponding projected graphs are built by defining two nodes\nof the same guild as neighbors - therefore linked by an\nedge - when both share a contact with at least one node\nof the other guild. For instance, two plants are considered as neighbors if they are visited by the same animal\nspecies or two directors are neighbors if they belong to\nthe same board.\nTwo nodes of one guild may share more than one contact with the nodes of the other guild. As a consequence,\nin the projected graphs not all edges have the same importance. Each edge carries a weight representing the\nnumber of common neighbors of the other kind thus providing a measure of the intensity of the corresponding\ninteraction.This is the case for instance when more than\none animal species visit the same pair of plants or two\nactors participate together in several films.\nWe also address the interesting question of how the\ngradual changes that are involved in the SNM are reflected both in the topology and the weights of the interactions in the projected graphs.\nThe aim of the previous analysis is to extract salient\nfeatures of social and biological networks and not to provide precise fittings to empirical data. Nevertheless we\ncompare in some detail theoretical predictions with the\nvalues observed in a real mutualist web [9] which is one of\nthe largest mutualistic system reported in the literature,\ntherefore allowing for statistical considerations.\nThe theoretical discussions presented in this work shed\nlight on several questions. In the first place they allow\nto establish links between nestedness and the shape of\n\ndegree distributions of biological networks, in the second\nplace they provide hints about possible reasons for the\ndifferent shapes of the degree distributions of both guilds\nfound in social networks. These two elements place biological and social webs into well differentiated classes of\nbipartite networks. Finally the theoretical predictions of\nthe SNM are extended to the projected graphs and are\nfound to provide a faithfull description of the distributions observed in the mutualistic network of Ref. [9].\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nThe Self-organizing Network Model\n\nWe describe here a generalization of the SNM introduced in Ref. [6]. We refer the reader to that article\nfor the details of the original model as well as for the\ncomparison of its results with the empirical observations.\nThe interaction pattern of a bipartite network can be\ncoded as an adjacency matrix in which rows and columns\nare labeled respectively by the plant and animal species\ninvolved in the network. Its elements Kp,a \u2208 {0, 1} represent respectively the absence or the presence of an interaction between the plant species p and the animal species\na. In what follows we drop the term species specifying\nthat when mentioning plants or animals we are not referring to the behavior of separate individuals but to all\nthe members of a species.\nThe SNM is a computer model that starts from a random adjacency matrix in which the number of plants,\nanimals and contacts between them are arbitrarily fixed\nprovided that there are no species left without links with\nthe other guild. Starting from this initial configuration\nplants and animals iteratively redefine their contacts by\nreallocating the 1's of the adjacency matrix. This reallocation obeys to some assumed CPR. In the following we\nconsider a CPR that indicates that the agents of either\nguild prefer to set contacts with a species of the opposite\nguild having a greater (or lesser) number of contacts.\nWe implement such swapping with the following algorithm. In each iteration first a row and next a column\nare chosen at random. Once a row (column) has been\nchosen its contacts are reallocated with probability Pr\n(Pc ). Reallocation consists in choosing at random a 1\nand 0 belonging to the same row (column), and swapping them acording to a previously selected CPR that\nwe discuss below in some detail. The row (column) is\nleft unchanged with probability 1 \u2212 Pr (1 \u2212 Pc ). In case\nthat, upon swapping, a row or a column would be left\nwith no links, the reallocation is not produced. This rule\nprevents the elimination of a node of the system as a\nconsequence of being left without interactions.\nThe two probability parameters Pr and Pc must not\nbe considered as independent because the only relevant\ndifferences appear when their ratio R = Pr /Pc is changed\ni.e. when columns and rows are updated with different\nfrequencies. We will consider in particular two limiting\n\n\f3\nsituations, one in which R \u2243 1 and another in which R \u226a\n1 or R \u226b 1. These respectively correspond to a situation\nin which rows and columns are updated with the same\nfrequency or to the case in which rows (columns) are\nupdated much more frequently than columns (rows).\nThe swapping process is continued until the CPR that\nhas been imposed is optimally satisfied and no further\nswappings can take place. The network reaches then a\nperfectly ordered phase [10].\nOne possible CPR [strategy (I)] is that the degree of\nthe new partner must be higher than the one of the previous partner. Within this CPR species of either kind\ntend to be as generalists as possible. An alternative possibility [Strategy (II)] is just the opposite, namely that\nthe new partner has fewer contacts than the previous\none. In this case species tend to be as specialists as possible. Strategy (I) bears some similarity with the rule of\npreferential attachment of Ref. [11]. This is a stochastic attachment rule by which new nodes are added to a\ngrowing network attaching to the existing nodes with a\nprobability that is proportional to their degree. There\nare however several important differences between preferential attachment and our strategy (I).\nIn the first place the approach in Ref.[11] deals with a\npopulation of entities, that are represented by the nodes\nof the graph, that grows constantly. Our model deals\ninstead with a closed system in which new nodes are not\nadded. It consequently involves a change of the topology\nof a network with a constant number of nodes and links.\nIn the second place preferential attachment is clearly a\nnon local process because the particular attachment of\na new node is governed by the degree distribution of all\nthe nodes of the network. Opposed to this, the present\nmodel follows a purely local rule. The reallocation of\ncontacts with both CPR's involves only the information\nof the current and of the target nodes of its counterparts\nin the bipartite network and has no relation whatsoever\nto any global feature of the network. It could be thought\nof as one species of animals changing its current choice\nas a consequence of the better conditions offered by an\nalternative species of plants that is more highly or poorly\nvisited.\nAs it is well known the fact that the decision rule is\nlocal is an important feature if the problem of the reallocation of all the contacts of the network is cast into\nthe form of the optimization problem of fulfilling a given\nCPR. Within this particular framework the SNM can be\nregarded as an heuristic solution for it.\n\nB.\n\nThe projected graphs\n\nThe information contained in a bipartite network can\nbe used to construct two separate graphs, each composed\nof nodes belonging to a single guild. This is done extracting two projected graphs fulfilling the rule that two nodes\nof the same guild are neighbors - and therefore linked by\nan edge - if they share a contact with at least one node\n\nof the other type in the bipartite network [1] .\nLet K be the adjacency matrix with elements Kp,a \u2208\n{0, 1} denoting the contacts between the plant p and the\nanimal a. K T is the transposed of K. The two matrices\nX\nP\nT\nT\nWp,p\n=\nKp,a Ka,p\n\u2032 = KK\n\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03b4p,p\u2032 )\na\n\nA\nWa,a\n\u2032\n\nT\n\n= K K=\n\nX\n\nT\nKa,p\nKp,a\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03b4a,a\u2032 )\n\n(1)\n\np\n\nencode the weighted adjacency matrix of the projected\ngraphs [12] for plants (W P ) and animals (W A ). The\ndiagonal elements:\nX\nDP (p) =\n(Kp,a )2\n(2)\na\n\nA\n\nD (a) =\n\nX\n\nT 2\n(Ka,p\n)\n\n(3)\n\np\n\nthat are canceled from the sums in Eq.(1) are the degrees\nof the plant and animal nodes in the bipartite graph. The\nnon vanishing off diagonal elements of W A,P carry the\ninformation of the number of different paths linking two\nnodes of the same kind involving not more than one node\nof the other guild. These weights could be interpreted\nas the intensity of the interaction between such pair of\nspecies. A suitable generalization of the concept of degree\nfor weighted graphs is just the total number of paths\nconnecting some given node with all nearest neighboring\nnodes of the same kind, namely:\nX\nA(P )\n(4)\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4i,j )Wi,j\nS A(P ) (i) =\nj\n\nThis is defined as the strength [2] of the node. It provides\na measure of the relevance of the species i in the plantor animal systems. The usual degree of the i\u2212th animal\nP (A)\nor plant in the projected graph is denoted by D\u03c0 (i)\nand is given by the number of non zero elements in each\nrow of the matrices W A(P ) .\nBesides the above distributions, the projected graphs\ncan also be characterized by the distribution of its clustering. The clustering Ci of the i-th node of any graph\nis defined (Ref.[3]) as\nCi =\n\nei\nki (ki \u2212 1)/2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ei is the number of edges among the neighbors\nof the i\u2212th node and ki is its degree. The clustering\ncoefficient is the fraction of first neighbors of a node that\nare themselves, neighbors among them.\nC.\n\nProperties of the projected graphs\n\nIt is convenient to derive some analytical results for the\nproperties of the projected graphs under the changes in\nthe topology of the original bipartite graph. To this end\n\n\f4\nwe assume a perfectly ordered bipartite graph described\nby an adjacency matrix with m rows and n columns and\na given probability of contacts \u03c6 and discuss the degree\ndistributions of the projected graphs.\nWe first consider an adjacency matrix with the same\nnumber of 1's in all its rows. This is the case for the perfect order produced by SNM using the CPR of strategy\n(II). As discussed below it also approximately represents\nthe situation of a random adjacency matrix.\nLet k = n\u03c6 be the number of 1's in each row. The\nprobability that any two rows share no contacts with the\nsame species of the other guild - and are therefore not\nneighbors in the projected graph - is:\n\u0001\nn\u2212k\n(n \u2212 k)!2\nk\u0001\nqn,k = n =\n(6)\nn!(n \u2212 2k)!\nk\n\ntherefore the probability that a given row has l neighbors\nand hence has degree l in the projected graph is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\u22121\nm\u22121\u2212l\nPl|m =\n(1 \u2212 qn,k )l qn,k\n; l = 1, 2 . . . , m \u2212 1\nk\n(7)\nThe number of rows with degree l is Nl|m = mPl|m . The\naverage degree of the row-species in the projected graph\ntherefore is\nNm =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nlNl|m = m(m \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 qn,k )\n\n(8)\n\nl=0\n\nSince k = n\u03c6 this degree distribution is fully specified\nby the dimensions of the matrix and the probability of\ncontacts \u03c6. A completely symmetric argument can be\nmade for the column-species changing n by m.\nThe degree distribution for the opposite case, i.e. when\nthe Strategy (I) is used and the system reaches an asymptotic order of perfect nestedness is simpler to obtain. If\nthere are no species with no contacts and the pattern of\ninteractions is nested, there exists at least one species of\neach guild that is a full generalist, i.e. has contacts with\nall species of the other kind. Under this condition all the\nspecies of each guild have contacts with the generalist of\nthe other guild and it is therefore a neighbor of all the\nother species of the same type. Such perfectly nested system gives therefore rise to two projected graphs that are\n\"tiny worlds\": all species are neighbors of each other[13].\nThe above Eq. 6 can also be used to derive a close\nof the two projected\nestimate of density of contacts \u03c6P,A\n\u03c0\ngraphs for plants and animals, provided that the bipartite\nadjacency matrix is random. This is\n\u03c6P\n\u03c0 (n, \u03c6) = 1 \u2212 qn,k=n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212\n\n(n \u2212 n\u03c6)!2\nn!(n \u2212 2n\u03c6)!\n\n(9)\n\nThe density for the projected graph for animals \u03c6A\n\u03c0 (m, \u03c6)\nis obtained from Eq.9 by changing n by m. This probability of contacts between nodes of the same guild is a\nrapidly growing function of \u03c6, the probability of contacts\nin the rectangular adjacency matrix. Hence, in general,\neven very sparse adjacency rectangular matrices give rise\nto densely connected projected networks.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nResults for the bipartite graphs\n\nIn the following, if not stated otherwise, we will discuss\nnumerical examples concerning Strategy (I). The reason\nfor this is two-fold: on one hand strategy (I) has a greater\nbiological significance and it has been successfully used\nin Ref.[6] to account for the degree distributions of several observed mutualistic systems of a wide range of sizes.\nOn the other hand the ordered patterns emerging from\nStrategy (II) can well be approximated by a random adjacency matrix. The reason for this is simple. The use\nof this strategy leads to a different situation in which all\nnodes of the same kind tend to have the same number of\nlinks [14]. If contacts are randomly assigned all species\nhave on average the same degree. Thus, the iterative\nordering of the SNM only tends to produce a sharper\ndelta-like function in the degree distributions, centered\nat the corresponding average number of links.\nWhenever strategy (I) is used the model always leads\nto a perfectly nested pattern, no matter the relative updating frequency of rows and columns, as shown in Fig.1.\nThese perfectly ordered systems have been obtained\nstarting from a random adjacency matrix of 50\u00d7150 with\na probability of contacts between both guilds of 10% and\nrunning the SNM algorithm for a very large number of\niterations until no further swappings take place. The different panels of Fig. 1 have different values of R and yet\nperfect nestedness is found in all cases.\nThe sole fact that interactions are arranged in a nested\npattern does not define the shape of the degree distributions. They do indeed differ drastically with R. Several\ndifferent shapes of this distribution can be found that are\nnevertheless compatible with a nested pattern of interaction. As we will soon see, the shape of the degree distribution actually provides some information about the\nway in which the CPR is actually enforced among the\nrow- or column- species.\nWe discuss the numerical results obtained with the\nSNM by comparing them with the real mutualistic system described in Ref.[9]. Real systems such as this are\nnot perfectly ordered. To obtain a theoretical prediction\nfrom the SNM an initial configuration has to be chosen that involves a random adjacency matrix with the\nsame number of species and interactions as the real system. The iterative ordering process starts from this initial state and is stoped before a perfect order has been\nreached using some appropriate stopping criterion that\ntakes into consideration the particular empirical situation under analysis. This is in fact the only adjustable\nparameter of the model. The results shown here correspond to 100000 iterations of the SNM. In this case the\nstopping criterium is based on a statistical estimate of\nthe departure from the isocline of perfect order. The\nalgorithm is stopped when the value of this estimate is\nclose to the empirically observed one.\nIn Fig.2 we show theoretical and empirically observed\n\n\f5\n\n50\n30\n\nR=0.1\n\n10\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n30\n\nR=0.2\n\n10\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n30\n\nR=1\n\n10\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n30\n\nR=5\n\nThe distributions for R \u226a 1 or R \u226b 1 for rows and\ncolumns shown in the right panels of Fig. 2 have quite\ndifferent behaviors and strongly depart from the observed\ndistributions of the mutualistic system. These curves\nshow the seemingly paradoxical result that the degrees\nof the guild that is updated less frequently distribute according to truncated a power law, while the more frequently updated guild has a distribution that is bellshaped thus indicating that the distribution of degrees\nhave not been greatly changed by the self organization\nprocess and have a distribution that resembles the original random pattern. This can be understood because\nwhen, say, columns are frequently updated most swappings take place within each column. The contacts that\nare changed are therefore those of the row-agents while\ncolumns keep their degrees with little change. Thus, the\ndegree distribution of the rows changes while that of the\ncolumn-agents remains close to the original random matrix producing a bell shaped curve. However this is not\na transient-like behavior by which a power law could be\nreached for both guilds with a larger number of iterations. The progressive ordering of contacts actually prevents this from happening thus giving rise to a perfectly\nnested system with a different order. A similar situation\nin which both guilds have different degree distributions\nhas been described [1] for social webs such as films and\nactors and boards and directors of large companies.\n\n10\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n30\n\nR=10\n\n10\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nFIG. 1: Asymptotic adjacency matrices of a bipartite network of\n50 \u00d7 150.

These are shown in Figs.3, 4 and 5. All figures\nhave the same organization of Fig.2, namely upper panels correspond to animals (columns) while lower panels\ncorrespond to plants (rows). Theoretical values are deduced from the rectangular adjacency matrix whose degree distributions are shown in Fig.2. We show results\nthat correspond to R = 1, R = 0.1 and R = 10.0. Empirically observed values are always displayed as a reference\nin spite of the fact that values of R that are different from\n1 are not expected to represent biological networks.\n\n1.\n\n[9] cumulative degree distributions [15] for three values\nR = 1.0, R = 0.1 and R = 10.0. The degree distributions for both guilds that are obtained with R = 1 and\nthe above number of iterations, closely follow truncated\npower laws, truncation being here a finite size effect.In\nthe limit of perfect order and R = 1 the distributions for\nplants and animals can be shown to map into each other\n[6] through the application of a simple scaling transformation.\n\nResults for the projected graphs\n\nDegree and clustering distributions.\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show the degree distributions of the projected graphs for plants and animals. For a perfectly\nordered system under Strategy (I) and for any value of R\nboth distributions should approach a delta like function\nlocated at the corresponding number of species. Since\nthe convergence to this limiting distribution is extremely\nslow, a partially ordered system is expected to show significant departures from such extreme distributions.\n\n\f6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nANIMALS\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nR = 0.1\nR = 10\n\n-1\n\nANIMALS\n\n10\n\n1000\n100\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nCOUNTS\n\nR = 1\n\nCUMULATIVE DSITRIBUTION\n\nCUMULATIVE DSITRIBUTION\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n\n0.1\n1\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nPLANTS\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nDEGREES IN BIPARTITE LATTICE\n\nR = 0.1\nR = 10\nPLANTS\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nCOUNTS\n\nR = 1\n\nCUMULATIVE DSITRIBUTION\n\nCUMULATIVE DSITRIBUTION\n\n100\n\nDEGREES IN BIPARTITE LATTICE\n\nDEGREES IN BIPARTITE LATTICE\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n1\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\nDEGREES IN BIPARTITE LATTICE\n\nFIG. 2: Cumulative degree distributions of plants and animals of a bipartite network with the same dimensions (456 \u00d7 1428) as in\nRef.[9], for different values of R. In the two panels on the right the corresponding non cumulative distributions are shown in the insets.\nThe empirical distributions for plants and animals are always shown in heavy continuous line. Theoretical results are averaged over 100\nrealizations of the original random adjacency matrix. All distributions have bin=2; this is the main reason for the noisy appearance\nof the empirical data. Notice that in the plots of the right, stars or triangles fail to account simultaneously the empirical data. The\nnon-cumulative degree distribution shown in the insets illustrate the different organizations of the networks with R = 0.1 and R = 10\n\nFor R \u226a 1 or R \u226b 1 either columns or rows are updated more frequently than rows or columns respectively.\nAs explained above this causes one of the two guilds to\ndevelop a prominent peak at the corresponding number\nof species. This is the situation shown in the two right\npanels of Fig. 3 in which filled triangles and stars exchange roles showing a peak at the extreme right.\nFor this same reason, the distributions for both guilds\nand R = 1 are not similar and indicate that one of the\ntwo guilds has reached a more ordered configuration than\nthe other. Indeed, while plants display a maximum at\nthe number of plant-species, animals have not yet developed such pattern showing a maximum close to the\norigin. Since there are more columns than rows even for\nR = 1 each row is randomly selected for updating more\nfrequently than each column. As a consequence plants\nare closer to a situation of perfect order. This effect is\nhard to observe directly in the bipartite graph. Theo-\n\nretical values obtained for R = 1 are seen to closely reproduce the empirically observed distributions while the\nSNM run with R \u226a 1 or R \u226b 1 gives rise to projected\ngraphs of a completely different nature.\nWe have also analyzed the distribution of clustering\nin the projected graphs. The results obtained for this\nconfirm those already shown for the degree distributions.\nUpon a perfect nested order the distributions also tend to\nbe delta functions located at a maximum value of 1. This\nagrees with the gradual approach to a tiny world pattern\nin which the projected graphs are complete graphs, no\nmatter the value of R. Such approach however strongly\ndepends upon the relative updating frequency of rows\nand columns. When R is widely different from 1, one\nof the two guilds shows a distribution of clustering that\nis a bell shaped while the other guild develops a strong\npeak at the maximum possible clustering equal to 1.

The\nshape of the full curves in the lower panels are diferent because of the binning.\n\nqualitative agreement with the observed data in which\nboth guilds appear not to be equally ordered: while animals have a heavily skewed distribution with a maximum\nat clustering equal to 1, plants have a more even distribution between clustering 0.8 and 1.0.\n\n2.\n\nDistribution of strengths.\n\nThe relative importance of the different species in both\nprojected systems is displayed by the distributions of\nstrengths. These are shown in Fig.4. These distributions provide insight about the relative relevance of the\ndifferent species in the two separate systems because they\ncombine into a single distribution the number of neighbors with the weights of the interactions linking them.\nFor a nested system with R \u2243 1, distributions approach\na (truncated) power law with a vast majority of nodes\nhaving a low strength, close to their degree in the projected graph. On the other hand, few nodes with many\nneighbors have a very high strength. If R \u226b 1 or R \u226a 1\none of the two strength distributions is shaped as a bell\n\nindicating little change with respect to the original random distribution, while the other follows the pattern explained above. General features of empirical values are\nalso well described by the results obtained with the SNM\n(left panel of Fig. 4)\n\n3.\n\nDistribution of weights.\n\nAs pointed up above, updating the interactions of\none guild changes the world that is seen by the other.\nThe weights of the projected graphs indicate how each\nguild mediates the relationship between individuals of\nthe other. Within the SNM such mediation changes with\nR. In Fig.5 we show the theoretical and the observed\ndistribution of weights for plants and animals with the\nsame conventions of the preceding figures. In the limit\nof perfect order and R = 1, weights within the animal or\nplant systems approach the decay of a truncated power\nlaw. The real system is not perfectly ordered and therefore the distributions have a different decay rate. This is\nseen in the two left panels of Fig.5.

This\nresult is consistent with what has been previously observed in connection with the degree distributions of the\nprojected graphs. The cases shown in the right panels\nconfirm that values of R that differ from 1 lead to a\npower-law distribution of strengths for only one of the\ntwo guilds.\nAlthough we have not attempted a detailed fit of empirical data, this is seen to be qualitatively consistent\nwith values R \u2243 1.\n\n4.\n\nDistribution of paths of minimum length.\n\nBesides the degrees, the strengths, the clustering coefficients, and the weights of the links, the projected graphs\nare also described by the distribution of the (minimal)\npath-lengths between any pair of nodes. This distribution is strongly dependent upon the probability of con-\n\ntacts \u03c6\u03c0 defined in Eq.(9), between two species of the\nsame guild, that in turn depends upon the ordering process stemming from the SNM.\nThe distribution of minimal path lengths has a different pattern depending upon the value of R and upon the\nCPR that is used in the ordering process. In Table (I) we\nshow as an example the results obtained with the SNM in\nseveral circumstances together with data of the observed\nsystem described in Ref [9]. For social type networks i.e.\nwhen rows and columns of the adjacency matrix are updated with very different frequencies, the distribution of\npath lengths has a different shape for each guild. The\nless frequently updated guild (in the example shown in\nTable (I) this corresponds to the columns) has a larger\nfraction of longer paths.\nThe occurrence of longer paths can only take place\nthrough minute alterations of a perfectly nested order\nof the bipartite network thus turning the distribution of\nminimal path lengths into a powerful tool to detect such\nalterations. This follows from the data of the network\n\n\f9\n\n7\n\n10\nR=1\n\n5\n\n10\n\nR=0.1\n\nRobertson (real)\n\nR=10\n\n5\n\nRobertson (real)\n\n3\n\n10\n\nCOUNTS\n\nCOUNTS\n\n10\n\n1\n\n3\n\n10\n\nANIMALS\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nANIMALS\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1\n\n10\n\nWEIGHT\n\n100\n\nWEIGHT\n\nR=1\n\n4\n\nR=0.1\n\n4\n\nRobertson (real)\n\n10\n\n10\n\nR=10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nCOUNTS\n\nCOUNTS\n\nRobertson (real)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nPLANTS\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nPLANTS\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1\n\n10\n\nWEIGHT\n\n100\n\nWEIGHT\n\nFIG. 5: Weight distributions of the links of the projected graphs for animals (upper panels) and plants (lower panels), and different values\nof R.\n\nreported in Ref.[9]. In this case one certainly checks the\ngross feature of a great majority of shorter paths. Besides\nthis, a small but significant fraction of paths of length 3\nis also present. This can not be expected to result from\nfluctuations in the random initial conditions used in running the SNM and is never reproduced for biologically\nsound values of the parameters of the SNM. A way to\nunderstand this is the following. The 1.4 % of paths of\nlength 3 are a total of almost 14,000 paths. This fraction of longer paths can be obtained from the presence\nof a very small set of perhaps a tenth of nodes that are\nlinked by single vertices to a densely interconnected core\nbuilt up by the other nearly 1400 nodes that have minimal paths only of lengths 1 and 2. Since the SNM is\na statistical model that deals equally with all species of\nboth guilds one should not expect to account for these\nsort of details.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a generalization of the SNM (Selforganizing Network Model) that aims at finding the\ntopology of a bipartite network that optimally takes into\naccount some local contact preference rule (CPR) between the agents of the two guilds. To achieve this the\nrows and the columns of the adjacency matrix alternatively and iteratively update their contacts following such\nrule.\nThe CPR that favors contacts with a counterpart with\nas many links as possible provided the best description\nof real mutualistic networks (Ref.[6]). Thus an insect\nprefers to visit a flower that has many other species visiting it and a flower tends to attract a wider variety of\ninsects. The opposite CPR that consists in developing\nsome kind of specialization by which contacts are as few\nas possible is not observed in nature and gives rise to degree distributions that are sharply peaked at one value.\nWe have also considered an extension of the SNM that\namounts to change the updating frequency of the con-\n\n\f10\ntacts of both guilds. When this extra degree of freedom is\nused, the model can also qualitatively account for the difference between the degree distributions of the two guilds\nthat is present in social networks such as boards and\ndirectors. These results indicate that nested bipartite\nnetworks may belong to two well differentiated classes.\nWhile R \u2243 1 represent the situation of ecological systems, R \u226a 1 or R \u226b 1 correspond instead to social\nnetworks[1].\nThe distributions that have been observed in social\nnetworks indicates that the CPR's are not the same for\n\nboth guilds as in the case of mutualistic webs. While the\ndegree distribution of one guild (say the distributions of\nthe number of seats of a board) may follow some random process around a mean that represents some common practice, the degree distributions of its counterparts\n(directors) may instead be governed by a non random\nprocess obeying some specific CPR similar to that of either plants or animals in a mutualistic web. Thus, executives sitting in these boards may be the outcome of a\nselection process based upon the special merit of sitting\nalready in several other boards (see Fig.8 of Ref.[1]).\n\nTable 1\nGUILD(1)\n\n\u03c6\u03c0 (%) D1\n\n(2)\n\n(%) D2 (%) D3 (%) D4 (%) COMMENTS\n\nANIMALS\nPLANTS\n\n26.6\n68.0\n\n26.7\n68.5\n\n71.9\n31.2\n\n1.4\n.3\n\n.004\n-\n\nANIMALS\nPLANTS\n\n22.1\n54.0\n\n22\n57\n\n78\n43\n\n-\n\n-\n\nRandom\n\nANIMALS\nPLANTS\n\n32.9\n65.0\n\n32\n65\n\n68\n35\n\n-\n\n-\n\n70,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(3)\n\n70,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(3)\n\nANIMALS\nPLANTS\n\n77.1\n86.8\n\n77\n87\n\n23\n13\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1,000,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(3),(4)\n\n1,000,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(3),(4)\n\nCOLUMNS 15.1\nROWS\n89.5\n\n15\n90\n\n84\n10\n\n.5\n-\n\n-\n\n70,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(5)\n\n70,000 iter. of SNM\n\n(5)\n\nEmpirical distribution of minimal path lengths (first two rows)\nfor the system described in Ref.[9] and several results of the SNM\nusing Strategy I with an adjacency matrix of the same dimensions\nand the same number of contacts.\n(1) Plants correspond to rows and animals to columns.\n(2) Dj are the fraction of paths of length j expressed as percentages\nof the total number of paths.

Indeed, when\nR = 1 we have found that such is precisely the case.\nHowever the present model indicates that there is not a\nclose relationship between the two concepts. With the\npresent model any bipartite network that is adapted under the SNM always reaches a perfectly nested pattern\nof interactions independently of the updating frequency\nof rows and columns. However, the degree distributions\nstrongly depend upon the different updating frequencies\nor, equivalently, by the prevailing order within each guild.\nThus nestedness has to be considered under a new light.\n\nObserved Ref.[9]\nObserved Ref.[9]\n\nRandom\n\nThe particular degree distributions observed in mutualistic webs should be attributed primarily to the particular\nway in which the pattern of interactions is achieved or, to\nput it into different words, to the way in which the CPR\nis actually enforced within the two guilds of the bipartite\nweb.\nAnother extension that we have considered is the study\nof the two projected graphs and the changes that are induced on them by the SNM. We stress the contribution of\nthis study to the understanding of the differences between\nsocial-type and ecological-type networks. In addition we\nhave also checked that the results of the SNM for the\nprojected graphs with R = 1 are also in good qualitative\nagreement with empirical observations of real biological\nsystems. Moreover the projected graphs can reveal if\nplants and animals have achieved a different degree of\norder, something that is difficult to observe directly from\nthe bipartite matrix.\nWe have studied the distribution of minimal path\nlengths within the projected graphs. This distribution\nis strongly dependent upon the probability of contacts.\nSince this is a rapidly growing function of the density of\ncontacts in the bipartite matrix, the projected systems\ntend to always be tiny worlds of very densely interconnected species. Moreover, the theoretical estimates of\nthe distribution of minimal path lengths for the system\n\n\f11\nof ref.[9] shed some light on possible reasons of minute departures from perfect order. The lack of a small fraction\nof paths of length 3 may perhaps be taken as a hint of\nthe presence of species within the system having different\nCPR's that, in turn may produce within the ecosystem\n\nwhat in ecology are called compartments (communities\nin complex network language), i.e. groups of species that\nwhile strongly connected among themselves, are weakly\nconnected to the rest of the network.\n\n[1] M.E.J.

One can construct a pattern of interactions\nthat acts as a trap -i.e. a local minimum - stagnating\nthe ordering process. Thus if during the iterative process the system falls into one of these configurations it\nwill not undergo any further reorganization and yet will\nnot correspond to an optimal allocation of contacts. Such\ntraps could be avoided for instance by mapping the selforganization process into the solution of an optimization\nproblem through simulated annealing. The occurrence of\nthese traps is however not relevant to our present analysis\nbecause they are not important when dealing with real\nbiological webs that are usually far from an asymptotically ordered pattern. If one aims at fitting empirical data\nthe self-organizing process has therefore to be stopped at\na moderate number of iterations. We will therefore ignore\nthis problem for the moment.\nA.-L.

This however does not change any statistical consideration.\nIn the rest of the work we only discuss degree distributions and not cumulative degree distributions such as it\nis a usual practice in the biological or ecological communities.\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n\f"}
