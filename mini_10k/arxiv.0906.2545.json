Within our model, the main cause\nof thermal conductivity reduction is momentum-nonconserving scattering of longitudinal acoustic phonons by\nanharmonic side phonon leads in quasi-one-dimensional phonon waveguide with dynamically rough surface or\nedge layers.\nPACS numbers: 44.10.+i, 05.45.-a, 05.60.-k, 05.70.Ln\n\nThermal conductivity (TC) of low-dimensional nanostructures has recently attracted much interest in connection with\nthe search for technologically feasible materials for thermoelectric applications [1, 2]. High-efficiency thermoelectric\nmaterials are important for power-generation devices, which\nare designed to convert waste heat into electrical energy, and\ntherefore they are expected to play an increasingly important\nrole in meeting the energy challenge of the future. The reduction of the TC without significant reduction of the electric conductivity is the most important strategy for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit, the parameter which\nmeasures the material potential for thermoelectric applications [1, 2]. Recent experiments have shown that TC of silicon nanowires (NWs) can be dramatically reduced by surface\nroughness [3, 4]. Furthermore, the phonon contribution to TC\nof a single-crystalline Si NW with diameter D \u223c 50 nm was\nshown to approach the limit of amorphous Si and therefore\na single-crystalline Si NW with such small diameter behaves\nlike a \"phonon glass\" [3]. This observation cannot be explained by the existing theories, although the important role\nof surface roughness in phonon scattering in NWs has been\nemphasized [5, 6, 7, 8]. Molecular dynamics (MD) modeling\nof diamond nanorods with functionalized surfaces also shows\nsignificant TC reduction in such low-dimensional systems [9].\nOn the other hand, quasi-ballistic long wavelength acoustic phonons in disordered harmonic or ideal anharmonic onedimensional (1D) systems give rise to TC coefficient, divergent with the system length, see, e.g., [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n16]. As it was shown for the first time by Peierls, only the\nmomentum-nonconserving scattering of phonons can limit TC\nof the system [17]. In this Letter we present analytical model\nand MD simulations of the TC of NWs and nanoribbons\n(NRs) with dynamically rough surfaces and edges which show\ndramatic decrease of TC in such partially-disordered systems,\nin contrast to TC of corresponding ideal systems (with atomically smooth surfaces and edges). The analytical model describes 1D lattice of coupled oscillators in which each oscillator is weakly coupled to weakly-anharmonic side oscillatory chain, or side phonon lead (SPL), which models dynami-\n\ncal surface roughness of the quasi-one-dimensional phonon\nwaveguide (Q1DPW), see Ref. [18]. Within this model,\nthe main cause of TC reduction is momentum-nonconserving\nscattering of longitudinal acoustic phonons by SPLs in dynamically rough surface or edge layers of the Q1DPW. Strong\nscattering of coherent longitudinal acoustic phonons in the\nQ1DPW is a result of energy losses caused by the excitation\nof acoustic phonons in SPLs, which propagate only outwards\nand do not return back to the Q1DPW in the form of coherent waves [18]. This occurs when the length of a SPL exceeds\n(spl)\nacoustic phonon mean free path (localization length) lph due\n(spl)\n\nto anharmonic scattering in the lead (which gives lph \u221d\u03c9 \u22122 ).\nThe effective length of the atomic or molecular SPL increases\nby random intersections with other SPLs in the rough surface\nor edge layer.\nThe proposed phonon scattering mechanism gives finite and\nfrequency-independent mean free path lph of the propagating along Q1DPW longitudinal acoustic phonons in a wide\nfrequency range, including low frequencies [18]. The value\nof phonon mean free path due to the dynamical-roughnessinduced momentum-nonconserving scattering is given by the\nlattice spacing in the Q1DPW a and coupling parameter between a SPL and Q1DPW g: lph \u2248a/g. Coupling parameter g is determined by the ratio of the cross-section area of\nthe rough layer (\u223c\u03c0D\u03b4) with the average root-mean-square\nroughness height \u03b4 and cross-section area of NW with diameter D: g\u223c\u03b4/D [18]. For atomically-thick rough surface layer\nwith \u03b4>a, acoustic phonon mean free path lph \u223cD(a/\u03b4) can\nbecome shorter than NW diameter [18]. Therefore this channel of surface phonon scattering substantially reduces mean\nfree path of \"long longitudinal waves\" which give dominant\ncontribution to phonon TC of quasi-1D systems, see Refs.\n[10, 11, 16]. This in turn causes a substantial reduction of\nphonon TC in NWs and NRs with dynamically rough surfaces or edges, which explains the significant TC reduction,\ndown to the level of TC of amorphous Si, observed in singlecrystalline Si NWs with rough surfaces [3]. The predicted\nreduction factor a/\u03b4 is quantitatively consistent with the ob-\n\n\f2\nserved reduction of TC of Si NWs with rough surface layers\nwith controlled thicknesses \u03b4>a [3] with respect to TC of Si\nNWs with the same diameters and smooth surfaces (with \u03b4\u223ca)\n[18].\nThis mechanism of momentum-nonconserving acoustic\nphonon scattering gives finite and length-independent coefficient of TC of Q1DPWs with atomically rough surfaces or\nedges with \u03b4>a, in contrast to the divergent with the system length coefficient of TC of anharmonic Q1DPWs with\natomically smooth surfaces or edges with \u03b4\u226aa, when the\nmomentum-nonconserving channel of acoustic phonon scattering is closed and mean free path of long-wave phonons\nsubstantially increases, lph \u221d\u03c9 \u22122 , and becomes lph \u226bD. The\nconsidered mechanism of acoustic phonon scattering by vibration of atomic or molecular chains in dynamically rough\nsurfaces and edges of NWs and NRs is qualitatively different from usually considered acoustic wave scattering by static\n(geometric) roughness on stress-free surfaces of solids [5, 14].\nAnalytical model of phonon transport in quasi-1D\nphonon waveguides with side phonon leads. We consider\n1D lattice with period a of coupled oscillators, with coupling\nconstant c and mass m, in which each oscillator is weakly coupled to SPL (\"lateral\" atomic chain with weakly-anharmonic\ncoupling), with (linear) interatomic coupling cl =gc\u226ac and\natomic mass ml =gm\u226am. Distribution of such SPLs along\nthe Q1DPW models its dynamical surface roughness [18].\nThe most important assumption of this model is that acoustic phonon, propagating along the Q1DPW, excites acoustic\nwaves in SPLs which propagate along the leads only outwards\nthe Q1DPW and do not return back to the waveguide in the\nform of coherent waves. With this assumption, we obtain dispersion equation for the dimensionless complex wave number\nkk a of the damped acoustic phonons, propagating along the\nQ1DPW [18]:\nr\nm\nm\nkk2 a2 = \u03c9 2 + i\u03c9g\n.\n(1)\nc\nc\nThis equation\npredicts that phonons with frequencies \u03c9 \u226b\np\n\u03c9 \u2217 \u2261 g c/m propagate quasi-ballistically, when\nr\ni\nm\n+ g,\n(2)\nkk a = \u03c9\nc\n2\nwhile low-frequency phonons, with \u03c9\u226a\u03c9 \u2217 , propagate diffusively, when \u03c9=\u2212iDphkk2 , with the diffusion coefficient\np\np\nDph =a2 c/m/g=Vph lph , where Vph =a c/m and lph =a/g\nare velocity and energy mean free path of long-wave acoustic phonons, cf. Eq. (2). Both quasi-ballistic and diffusive\nacoustic phonons contribute to phonon TC coefficient \u03baph\nof Q1DPW as \u03baph \u223cCph Dph \u223cCph Vph a/g, where Cph is the\ncontribution of longitudinal phonons to the specific heat of\nNW or NR. This predicts, in agreement with the observations\n[3, 4] and our MD simulations, the significant reduction of\nphonon mean free path and TC caused by phonon scattering by dynamical surface roughness in NWs and NRs (with\ng\u223c\u03b4/D and \u03b4\u226ba).\n\nFigure 1: (a) Model of 2D atomic ribbon with rough edges which\nconsists of M =12 chains with ideal core of M0 =4 chains and two\nrough edges of M1 =4 chains with p=0.3 randomly deleted atoms.

We consider\nthe atomic structure consisting of M parallel chains of atoms\nplaced in one plane.

For the purpose of calculating the\nheat flux along the NR, we can define the corresponding total\nenergy of the nth cross-section en and local energy flux jn in\nthe ribbon, which satisfy the continuity condition \u0117n =jn\u22121 \u2212\njn , see, e.g., Ref. [19].\nWe consider a NR built of M = M0 + 2M1 chains. To\nmodel two dynamically rough edges with widths M1 , we randomly delete some atoms in the chains m = 1, ..., M1 and\nm = M1 + M0 + 1, ..., M1 + M0 + M1 . Let 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1 be\nthe probability of atom removal. In result of the random atom\nremoval from the edge layers, some atoms in the edges will\nbecome completely isolated and should be deleted as well.\nModel NR with two rough edges with p = 0.3 randomly\ndeleted atoms is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nAssuming for the certainty that U (\u03c1) = 21 V (\u03c1), where\nV (\u03c1) \u2261 Vmn (\u03c1) and U (\u03c1) \u2261 Umn (\u03c1), we consider V (\u03c1) =\n\u03c12 /2, V (\u03c1) = \u03c12 /2 + \u03c14 /4, V (\u03c1) = exp(\u2212\u03c1) + \u03c1 \u2212 1,\nV (\u03c1) = [exp(\u2212\u03c1) \u2212 1]2 /2 and V (\u03c1) = 1 \u2212 cos(\u03c1) as, respectively, the harmonic, Fermi-Past-Ulam (FPU), Toda, Morse\n\n\f3\n\nJ(N \u2212 1)\n\u03ba(N ) =\n,\n(TN0 +1 \u2212 TN0 +N )(M0 + 2M1 q)\n\nN\n\n0.34\n\n5\n1\n\nln \u03ba\n\nN\n\n0.30\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\nN\n\n0.32\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n1\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n5\n\n\u22121\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1\n7\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nln \u03ba\n\nand rotational potentials. It is worth mentioning that the ribbons with the harmonic, FPU, Toda or Morse interatomic potentials and ideal atomically smooth edges have infinite coefficients of TC in the limit of N \u2192 \u221e. In purely harmonic systems, acoustic phonons do not interact and there is no energy\nscattering in phonon thermal transport. Infinite TC coefficients in ribbons with the anharmonic FPU, Toda or Morse interatomic potentials are related with the quasi-ballistic transport of the long-wave acoustic phonons with long mean free\npaths lph \u221d \u03c9 \u22122 . Ideal ribbons with the rotational potential\nhave finite TC in the limit of N \u2192 \u221e and finite temperatures\n[20, 21].\nThe ribbon TC is found in two independent ways. The\nfirst method relies on direct modeling of heat transport along\nthe ribbon. For this purpose, we consider a ribbon with total length N + 2N0 (N0 = 40 is the length of ribbon ends),\nwhich ends are placed in Langevin thermostats with different\ntemperatures of the left, T+ = 1.1T , and right,T\u2212 = 0.9T ,\nends, where T is average temperature). In the middle part\nof the ribbon with length N the stationary heat flux Jn = J\nand linear temperature gradient of ribbon temperature Tn are\nestablished (where Jn is determined by the time-average of\nthe local heat flux hjn i in the stationary conditions). Thus the\nTC coefficient \u03ba(N ) of the finite-length ribbon can be reliably\ndetermined as\n\n8\n\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M0 is the width of central ideal strip, 2M1 q is total\nwidth of rough edges with filling fraction q\u22611 \u2212 p < 1. TC\ncoefficient \u03ba is determined from \u03ba(N ) as the limit of N \u2192\n\u221e. The ribbon temperature profile Tn depends on a particular\nrealization of the edge roughness and therefore it is necessary\nto perform averaging over its independent realizations. In our\nsimulations, we averaged over 120 independent realizations\nof the edge roughness.\nWe modeled heat transport in rough-edge NRs with central part length of N =20,40,80,160,320,640. Dependence of\nTC coefficients on the length of NR with rough edges, with\np = 0.3 randomly deleted atoms, is shown in Fig. 2(a) for\ndifferent interatomic potentials. As one can see in this figure,\nthe rough-edge ribbon has finite coefficient of TC in the limit\nof infinite length for all the considered nonlinear interatomic\npotentials. In contrast to that, TC coefficient \u03ba(N ) of the\nrough-edge ribbon with purely harmonic lattice continuosly\ndecreases for N \u2192\u221e, see Fig. 2(b), and the limiting value of\nTC coefficient of such NR is zero, \u03ba(\u221e)=0. Figure 2(b) also\nshows that for the given width of the ideal ribbon core M0 , TC\ncoefficient of the NR decreases with the increase of the rough\nedges width M1 . Therefore the infinite-length ribbon or wire\nwith purely harmonic lattice and dynamically rough edges can\nbe considered as an ideal thermal insulator.\nWe relate the reason for such strong difference between\nTC coefficients of rough-edge NRs with harmonic and anharmonic interatomic potentials with the properties of SPLs\nin corresponding systems. In the anharmonic systems, long\n\n\u22125\n3\n\n4\n\nln N\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 2: (a) Dependence of TC coefficient \u03ba on length N of 2D\nribbons with smooth and rough edges for the Toda (curves 1 and 4,\ntemperature T = 1), Morse (curves 2 and 5, temperature T = 0.1)\nand FPU (curves 3 and 6, T =10) interatomic potentials. (b) Dependence of TC coefficient \u03ba on length N of 2D ribbons with purely\nharmonic lattices and rough edge widths M1 =1 and M1 =4 (curves\n7 and 8) with p=0.3 randomly deleted atoms. Ideal core width is\nM0 =2, temperature T =1.\n\nacoustic waves, excited in SPLs, do not return back and the\neffective \"internal radiative losses\" result in finite phonon\nmean free path and phonon TC in the Q1DPW, see Eqs.\n(1) and (2). In purely harmonic systems, the long acoustic\nwaves, excited in SPLs, return back into the Q1DPW and\nstrongly suppress the transmission of low-frequency acoustic phonons through the Q1DPW because of destructive interference with the phonons propagating along the waveguide\ncore (the phonon Fano resonance, see Ref. [18] for a brief\nreview). This produces the effective stop band (or AndersonFano localization) for low-frequency acoustic phonons in the\nQ1DPW with harmonic lattice and dynamically rough edges\n[18], and, correspondingly, the decrease of TC coefficient of\nthe NR in the limit of N \u2192\u221e. Indeed, we observe only the\nlocalized vibration eigenstates in harmonic phonon spectrum\nof such system (not shown).\nIn the approach based on Green-Kubo method, TC is de-\n\n\f4\nand nanoribbons with anharmonic lattices and dynamically\nrough surfaces and edges. In agreement with recent experiments on heat transport in single-crystalline silicon nanowires\nwith rough surfaces, our model and simulations predict finite and length-independent phonon thermal conductivity in\nsuch quasi-one-dimensional systems, in contrast to anomalous\nphonon thermal conductivity of corresponding momentumconserving systems with atomically smooth surfaces, divergent with the system length. We also present the thermalinsulator-like heat transport in long-length nanowires and\nnanoribbons with purely harmonic lattices and dynamically\nrough surfaces, caused by the Anderson-Fano phonon localization.\n\n4\n1\n\n3\n\nln \u03ba\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n3\n\n\u22122\n3\n\n4\n\nln N\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 3: Dependence of TC coefficient of nanowires with ideal\n(curve 1) and rough (curves 2 and 3) surfaces on length N , for the\nToda (curves 1 and 2) and harmonic (curve 3) potentials.\n\nfined as integral of the autocorrelation of heat fluxes:\n\u03ba(N ) = lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nP\n\n1\nN T 2 (M0 + 2M1 q)\n\nZt\n\nYu.A.K. thanks A.

Values of \u03ba(N ) obtained with the use of two different approaches,\nEqs.(4) and (5), coincide with good accuracy.\nWe also perform MD simulations of the temperature dependence of TC of rough-edge NRs with the FPU, Toda and\nrotational interatomic potentials (not shown). All the obtained\ndependencies confirm the finite coefficients of TC of the NRs\nin the low temperature limit T \u2192 0 when the coefficients of\nclassical TC of corresponding NRs with atomically smooth\nedges diverge.\nMD simulations of TC of 3D nanowires. We consider 3D\nmodel system made of M \u00d7K parallel molecular chains as it is\nshown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). The Hamiltonian of the system\nwe take as a 3D generalization of the Hamiltonian (3) of 2D\nribbon scalar model. In Fig. 3 we show the length dependence\nof nanowire TC coefficient for the Toda and harmonic interatomic potentials. It demonstrates that similar to the case of\n2D nanoribbon, the dynamical roughness of the surface layer\nchanges the increasing (divergent) with the length TC of 3D\nnanowire to the finite or decreasing with the nanowire length\nTC of 3D nanowire with, respectively, the anharmonic or harmonic interatomic potential.\nIn summary, we present analytical model and molecular\ndynamics simulations of phonon heat transport in nanowires\n\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nyukosevich@gmail.com\nasavin@center.chph.ras.ru\nM.S.
